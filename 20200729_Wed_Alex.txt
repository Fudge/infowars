[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[00:10.000 --> 00:38.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:38.000 --> 00:41.000]  96 days out from the election.
[00:41.000 --> 00:43.000]  96 days out.
[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000]  It is Wednesday.
[00:47.000 --> 00:51.000]  July 29th.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  2020, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53.000 --> 00:59.000]  And the Republic continues to roll on
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  when the CHICOM Globalists are losing the war against America.
[01:05.000 --> 01:10.000]  Every attempt they launch to intimidate us and drive us into submission
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  is only waking more people up.
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  So these look like bad times, but as it is stated in the Tale of Two Cities,
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  it was the best of times.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  It was the worst of times.
[01:29.000 --> 01:35.000]  We should all thank our lucky stars that we were born in America
[01:35.000 --> 01:40.000]  and that we are in the arena, not spectators,
[01:40.000 --> 01:48.000]  and that we are the captains of our own destinies.
[01:48.000 --> 01:55.000]  I have news from federal and state sources,
[01:55.000 --> 01:57.000]  and also just see it unfolding in front of you.
[01:57.000 --> 02:01.000]  You don't need the intelligence from the higher levels.
[02:01.000 --> 02:04.000]  We're all seeing the same thing.
[02:04.000 --> 02:11.000]  And I just confirmed with APD sources
[02:11.000 --> 02:16.000]  information so incredible
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.000]  that I am not just going to put it out here at the start of the broadcast.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  I'm going to make some calls during the breaks.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  And I'm going to really think about what I'm going to say about this.
[02:27.000 --> 02:36.000]  But this is going to be Paul Revere level stuff you're going to hear.
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  Now, the British were an open enemy landing troops,
[02:40.000 --> 02:44.000]  one of them by land, two of them by sea, up in the church steeple.
[02:44.000 --> 02:49.000]  One lantern for land, two lanterns, they came by sea.
[02:49.000 --> 02:53.000]  And they knew to ride and warn people and fight back.
[02:53.000 --> 02:56.000]  The globalists are run by psychologists and psychiatrists,
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  so everything they do is incremental, is ambient background,
[02:59.000 --> 03:02.000]  as they ratchet up war, as they ratchet up violence,
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  until finally when they're blowing up capitals,
[03:05.000 --> 03:08.000]  blowing up federal buildings, murdering people,
[03:08.000 --> 03:10.000]  it'll be called protest.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  And there's a lot of videos where the protesters admit that
[03:13.000 --> 03:16.000]  they're creating chaos to bring down the government,
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.000]  to bring in another authoritarian government.
[03:19.000 --> 03:24.000]  And so as bad and corrupt and slouching as our government's gotten
[03:24.000 --> 03:31.000]  towards Gomorrah, to take a word from Judge Bork's lexicon,
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  slouching towards Gomorrah, it's our republic,
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  and it's light years better.
[03:38.000 --> 03:40.000]  And the skeleton of the Renaissance,
[03:40.000 --> 03:42.000]  compared to the chai com globalist,
[03:42.000 --> 03:47.000]  Jacob and French Revolution nightmare.
[03:47.000 --> 03:50.000]  But I can't tell you what we already knew,
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  but it's totally confirmed now.
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  Soros, Deep State, Obama-controlled, Hillary-controlled, Antifa,
[03:59.000 --> 04:08.000]  will be the decoys, the distraction systems,
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  for real hit teams, preparing to try to decapitate
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  the leadership of the pro-human, pro-American movement,
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  whether you're a corporate person, an academic,
[04:20.000 --> 04:23.000]  in finance, in government, in the military,
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  you're targeted for death.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  And they may launch the attack next week,
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  or they may launch it during the last days of the election,
[04:32.000 --> 04:35.000]  they may launch it after, but they have the safety off,
[04:35.000 --> 04:38.000]  the finger on the trigger, MS-13 hit squads,
[04:38.000 --> 04:40.000]  chai com hit squads, everybody.
[04:40.000 --> 04:42.000]  And they're getting ready to totally overthrow everything,
[04:42.000 --> 04:44.000]  and they're coming to kill you and your family.
[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000]  So be ready, lock and load, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:46.000 --> 04:48.000]  Get ready, incoming globalist.
[04:48.000 --> 04:50.000]  Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  This is it, the battle for the republic.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  You live to see it.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Jump on in and come in for the big win.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[05:03.000 --> 05:07.000]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  The casual society, the surveillance system,
[05:14.000 --> 05:17.000]  global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[05:17.000 --> 05:21.000]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are
[05:21.000 --> 05:24.000]  obsolete, that we are non-essential,
[05:24.000 --> 05:29.000]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[05:33.000 --> 05:38.000]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally,
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  and it's extremely predatory.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations,
[05:48.000 --> 05:52.000]  the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners
[05:52.000 --> 05:55.000]  and the losers and consolidate power.
[05:55.000 --> 06:23.000]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  The alliance between the conspiracy theorist.
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  He just kept adding more and more outrageous lies to the story.
[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000]  The dirty trickster.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  Roger delivers legitimacy to Alex Jones,
[06:35.000 --> 06:38.000]  and Jones delivers to Trump a disaffected voter.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  And the president of the United States.
[06:40.000 --> 06:41.000]  I will not let you down.
[06:41.000 --> 06:45.000]  Now those ideas, which used to be on the fringe, are in the mainstream.
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  Conspiratorial thinking is a feature of this present.
[06:48.000 --> 06:53.000]  Now on Frontline, United States of Conspiracy.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  This is provided at FordFoundation.org.
[07:20.000 --> 07:24.000]  Additional support is provided by the Abrams Foundation,
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  committed to excellence in journalism.
[07:26.000 --> 07:28.000]  The Park Foundation,
[07:28.000 --> 07:31.000]  dedicated to heightening public awareness of critical issues.
[07:31.000 --> 07:34.000]  The John and Helen Glesner Family Trust,
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  supporting trustworthy journalism that informs and inspires.
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  And by the Frontline Journalism Fund,
[07:40.000 --> 07:54.000]  with major support from John and Joanne Haykler.
[07:54.000 --> 07:57.000]  This program contains mature content.
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  Your discretion is advised.
[08:01.000 --> 08:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[08:03.000 --> 08:07.000]  it is 10.39 Central Standard Time, 11.39 Eastern.
[08:07.000 --> 08:10.000]  Roger Stone, works at four administrations,
[08:10.000 --> 08:11.000]  one of all the nine campaigns.
[08:11.000 --> 08:12.000]  He's here tonight.
[08:12.000 --> 08:14.000]  It's a moment of enormous tension.
[08:14.000 --> 08:17.000]  I'm working the phones very aggressively,
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  working my contacts.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  But I got to shake your hand on a strong showing, regardless.
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.000]  I was in the studio with Alex Jones and Roger on Election Day.
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.000]  And the metrics were off the charts
[08:34.000 --> 08:37.000]  about how many people were tuning in to Info Wars,
[08:37.000 --> 08:40.000]  numbers that were comparable to the networks.
[08:40.000 --> 08:45.000]  Alex Jones, extremist conspiracy theorist,
[08:45.000 --> 08:48.000]  had rallied his audience behind Donald Trump.
[08:48.000 --> 08:51.000]  He's saying Trump is projected to win.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  As the night grew on,
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  it became clearer and clearer that Trump was likely to win.
[08:58.000 --> 09:00.000]  It is officially over.
[09:00.000 --> 09:02.000]  Pennsylvania has been called.
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.000]  We had no idea whatsoever that Trump was going to win.
[09:06.000 --> 09:08.000]  You talked about Trump's campaign.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  All of a sudden, everybody was super-related.
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.000]  We had some staff members
[09:14.000 --> 09:18.000]  that was just running around the office in a big circle.
[09:18.000 --> 09:19.000]  I mean, people were like,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  oh, I mean, going crazy that night.
[09:22.000 --> 09:23.000]  You see him right there.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  He's going to be speaking momentarily.
[09:26.000 --> 09:28.000]  He's got his voice there.
[09:28.000 --> 09:34.000]  There was a combination of elation and confusion.
[09:34.000 --> 09:38.000]  And they realized that, oh, my God,
[09:38.000 --> 09:42.000]  we just played a role in making the president of the United States.
[09:42.000 --> 09:43.000]  Here goes Trump.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  Turn it up, Donald J. Trump.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  Mainstream media.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  Government cover-ups.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  You want to stop tyranny?
[09:52.000 --> 09:54.000]  Well, so does he.
[09:54.000 --> 09:59.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[09:59.000 --> 10:02.000]  We're live thanks to your support.
[10:02.000 --> 10:05.000]  Wednesday, July 29th, the year 2020,
[10:05.000 --> 10:10.000]  96 days out from where we were four years ago.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  But now the enemy has been drawn out in the open.
[10:13.000 --> 10:15.000]  World government has been openly announced.
[10:15.000 --> 10:19.000]  Our media is under UN control publicly.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  And now they're calling for my arrest and imprisonment
[10:23.000 --> 10:25.000]  on programs like Frontline.
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  It's all coming up.
[10:28.000 --> 10:30.000]  I'm extremely honored.
[10:30.000 --> 10:32.000]  Extremely pleased.
[10:32.000 --> 10:34.000]  Because I came looking for this fight.
[10:34.000 --> 10:35.000]  And I found it.
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  Thanks to all of you together.
[10:37.000 --> 10:39.000]  We're winning.
[10:39.000 --> 10:41.000]  Because it's about the species.
[10:41.000 --> 10:43.000]  It's about our children.
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.000]  It's not about us as individuals.
[10:47.000 --> 10:49.000]  Yes.
[10:49.000 --> 10:50.000]  Yes.
[10:50.000 --> 10:54.000]  My eventual destruction and your destruction
[10:54.000 --> 10:57.000]  will lead to the Tree of Liberty's empowerment.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  As we stand on the shoulders of those that paid the debt,
[11:01.000 --> 11:03.000]  so shall we pay the debt.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  You will make that metaphysical connection to the past
[11:06.000 --> 11:08.000]  and surge forward into the future
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  like lightning falling from the hand of Zeus.
[11:15.000 --> 11:17.000]  Feel it coming.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  It's knocking on your back door.
[11:21.000 --> 11:23.000]  It's no denying.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  Yeah, you're not going to run.
[11:29.000 --> 11:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide.
[11:32.000 --> 11:34.000]  The point of no return.
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  Now you know the score.
[11:40.000 --> 11:42.000]  Now you're burning.
[11:42.000 --> 11:45.000]  All right, let's get right into it right now.
[11:50.000 --> 11:53.000]  Next hour, I'm going to lay out information
[11:53.000 --> 11:55.000]  that you're going to see unfold and happen.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  Just like almost everything we've talked about,
[11:59.000 --> 12:01.000]  you've seen unfold and happen.
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.000]  And the fact that we know this gives us a really good chance to beat it.
[12:04.000 --> 12:06.000]  But it's crazy.
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  It's dangerous.
[12:08.000 --> 12:11.000]  And it shows how the establishment has gotten away
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  with so much
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  that they believe they're immune
[12:18.000 --> 12:20.000]  from retribution
[12:21.000 --> 12:23.000]  for the actual
[12:23.000 --> 12:26.000]  white-hot civil war that we're going to enter.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  Now they had any sense of history.
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  They'd know that pride goeth before the fall.
[12:37.000 --> 12:39.000]  And that their overconfidence
[12:39.000 --> 12:42.000]  will be their downfall.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.000]  Don't take my commitment as confidence.
[12:46.000 --> 12:49.000]  It's just commitment and understanding of history.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  But these individuals believe that they will escape retribution.
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  I seek retribution.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  I seek the attack
[13:00.000 --> 13:03.000]  because that is where the enemy is.
[13:03.000 --> 13:06.000]  Because I seek to take on the globalist.
[13:06.000 --> 13:09.000]  I seek to destroy them.
[13:09.000 --> 13:11.000]  And the more I'm attacked,
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  the more it means I'm in the center of the battle,
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  in the fulcrum.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  What an honor.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  Now, I know you're in the fulcrum as well.
[13:22.000 --> 13:24.000]  That's why you're here.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  And that's why your word of mouth is king
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  on this planet.
[13:29.000 --> 13:31.000]  Your free will is paramount.
[13:31.000 --> 13:34.000]  So remember, however you're watching,
[13:34.000 --> 13:36.000]  or however you're listening,
[13:36.000 --> 13:39.000]  you amplify this transmission.
[13:40.000 --> 13:42.000]  And we will win.
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  We'll win one way or another,
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.000]  but we'll win this round of the fight.
[13:46.000 --> 13:49.000]  And have a much easier chance down the road
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  to go through this AI challenge
[13:51.000 --> 13:54.000]  and not lose more than,
[13:54.000 --> 13:56.000]  I don't know, a billion people or so.
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  And I know that sounds like a lot,
[13:58.000 --> 14:01.000]  I mean, there will be, there's five million people left
[14:01.000 --> 14:03.000]  on the current trajectory.
[14:03.000 --> 14:05.000]  I mean, wow, people are going to be begging to die
[14:05.000 --> 14:07.000]  before this is all over,
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  especially all you that are signing onto the New World Order
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  so you can act like fancy pants
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  for a few more years and be part of the system.
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  What fools you are.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  But let me just recalibrate and come back
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  and break it all down.
[14:19.000 --> 14:22.000]  We have seen the most spectacular
[14:22.000 --> 14:25.000]  level of censorship yet,
[14:25.000 --> 14:28.000]  where more than a dozen doctors,
[14:28.000 --> 14:30.000]  some of them own major clinic,
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  chains, hospitals, you name it.
[14:33.000 --> 14:35.000]  Emergency room doctors, clinic owners,
[14:35.000 --> 14:37.000]  hospital managers, they get out there
[14:37.000 --> 14:39.000]  and they go, hey, hydroxychloric one,
[14:39.000 --> 14:40.000]  here's all the studies.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  It's been used for hundreds of years.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  It has a 99% cure rate for all these different viruses
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  because it drives you in.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  And Facebook, Google, Twitter,
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  they all ban it, they block the president's tweet,
[14:51.000 --> 14:54.000]  and they suspend Donald Trump Jr.
[14:54.000 --> 14:56.000]  and they say in the news,
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  because the UN says,
[14:59.000 --> 15:01.000]  hydroxychloric one's no good.
[15:01.000 --> 15:03.000]  I mean, talk about an illustration.
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  The UN says, I have headlines here,
[15:07.000 --> 15:09.000]  where the UN says,
[15:09.000 --> 15:11.000]  here's another one,
[15:11.000 --> 15:14.000]  United Nations orders US to stop using excessive force
[15:14.000 --> 15:17.000]  on peaceful Portland protesters.
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  And it's a UN press release.
[15:21.000 --> 15:23.000]  Just like that, people are being ordered around
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  by the UN.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.000]  And how does the UN do it?
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  It would stage riots,
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  it would have armies of people wearing black covering their face,
[15:30.000 --> 15:32.000]  not wearing blue helmets.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  They're the academics.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  And then if you resist them, oh, you're bad,
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  so there's got to be more rioting.
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.000]  And the UN comes in with the Democrats to remove Trump
[15:41.000 --> 15:43.000]  and they're announcing that's their plan.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  Wow.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  Have we gotten them to come out of the open
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.000]  out of desperation?
[15:49.000 --> 15:51.000]  We have forced them into a desperate move
[15:51.000 --> 15:54.000]  that even if they succeed in taking out Trump and yours truly,
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.000]  they'll lose a few rounds later because of this.
[15:57.000 --> 16:00.000]  The BBC is state-run media in the UK
[16:00.000 --> 16:02.000]  and they've come out with a detailed article
[16:02.000 --> 16:06.000]  that's linked on infowars.com saying,
[16:06.000 --> 16:08.000]  you will have to have forced inoculations
[16:08.000 --> 16:11.000]  multiple times a year to be able to travel.
[16:11.000 --> 16:14.000]  Robots will scan you when you land.
[16:14.000 --> 16:17.000]  You will have a digital tattoo under your skin
[16:17.000 --> 16:19.000]  to be able to enter the country.
[16:19.000 --> 16:22.000]  But it's going to be so easy and so cool and so fun.
[16:22.000 --> 16:24.000]  The Microsoft website now officially
[16:24.000 --> 16:26.000]  has announced the digital tattoo.
[16:26.000 --> 16:28.000]  We exposed this six months ago.
[16:28.000 --> 16:29.000]  Bill Gates was funding it.
[16:29.000 --> 16:31.000]  They had hundreds of news articles attacking
[16:31.000 --> 16:33.000]  and saying it wasn't true.
[16:33.000 --> 16:34.000]  This is a tactic they use.
[16:34.000 --> 16:35.000]  First they announce it.
[16:35.000 --> 16:36.000]  We say it's a bad idea.
[16:36.000 --> 16:37.000]  They say, that's crazy.
[16:37.000 --> 16:38.000]  We didn't do it.
[16:38.000 --> 16:39.000]  They introduce the idea to you.
[16:39.000 --> 16:41.000]  Then they come back and announce it again
[16:41.000 --> 16:43.000]  thinking you have no memory.
[16:43.000 --> 16:45.000]  This is a criminal takeover.
[16:45.000 --> 16:47.000]  This is the wine in the sand.
[16:47.000 --> 16:49.000]  We must say no.
[16:49.000 --> 16:51.000]  We must expose the fraud of COVID-19.
[16:51.000 --> 16:53.000]  This entire house of evil is built on.
[16:53.000 --> 16:54.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[16:54.000 --> 16:55.000]  Never surrender to tyranny.
[16:55.000 --> 16:57.000]  infowars.com.
[16:57.000 --> 17:01.000]  Vicky Gibbs, 57-year-old,
[17:01.000 --> 17:04.000]  lesbian preacher in Houston,
[17:04.000 --> 17:06.000]  went in with a cough,
[17:06.000 --> 17:07.000]  got intubated,
[17:07.000 --> 17:09.000]  and then died.
[17:09.000 --> 17:11.000]  And as soon as I saw her face,
[17:11.000 --> 17:12.000]  as soon as I saw the report,
[17:12.000 --> 17:14.000]  I said, watch, it'll be innovation.
[17:14.000 --> 17:16.000]  We know what's going to happen.
[17:16.000 --> 17:17.000]  It's a blue city.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  The same story yet again.
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  And they say her heart gave out.
[17:21.000 --> 17:23.000]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube
[17:23.000 --> 17:25.000]  of COVID-19 as a death sentence,
[17:25.000 --> 17:27.000]  it's on record when everyone you know
[17:27.000 --> 17:29.000]  before they go to the hospital and get killed.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  Why are almost all the deaths happening
[17:31.000 --> 17:33.000]  in blue cities and blue states?
[17:33.000 --> 17:35.000]  It's because they intubate them,
[17:35.000 --> 17:36.000]  putting a tube in their lungs,
[17:36.000 --> 17:39.000]  and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  And if you do that with oxygen,
[17:41.000 --> 17:43.000]  the doctors are on record saying,
[17:43.000 --> 17:44.000]  it will kill you.
[17:44.000 --> 17:47.000]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.000]  follow their orders.
[17:49.000 --> 17:51.000]  And the minute I saw this report today,
[17:51.000 --> 17:53.000]  I knew what I would be reading.
[17:53.000 --> 17:56.000]  Don't end up like Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[17:56.000 --> 18:11.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:11.000 --> 18:15.000]  96.
[18:15.000 --> 18:18.000]  96 days until the election.
[18:18.000 --> 18:20.000]  It's bigger than an election.
[18:20.000 --> 18:23.000]  It's America that woke up two minutes to midnight
[18:23.000 --> 18:26.000]  with a globalist bullet constrictor
[18:26.000 --> 18:28.000]  wrapped around his crushing life out of us.
[18:28.000 --> 18:31.000]  But now, we've struggled almost free.
[18:31.000 --> 18:33.000]  We're bleeding. We're hurt.
[18:33.000 --> 18:36.000]  But the snake has fear in its eyes
[18:36.000 --> 18:38.000]  and it's bleeding as well.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  Seize it by the throat, gouge its eyes out,
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.000]  destroy it, sever its head,
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  and move forward.
[18:49.000 --> 18:52.000]  Well, all over the United States,
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  every night they run around the Antifa, the BLM Communist,
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  the Democratic Party.
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  That's who gets all the contributions from it.
[18:59.000 --> 19:03.000]  Shooting people in the head, burning, looting, robbing.
[19:03.000 --> 19:10.000]  And now, the Portland judge is finding
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  the federal government $500 an hour
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  for having a fence up around their property
[19:20.000 --> 19:23.000]  so that when they come and try to burn the building down
[19:23.000 --> 19:26.000]  and break into the rooms,
[19:26.000 --> 19:28.000]  the feds come out and defend themselves,
[19:28.000 --> 19:31.000]  and then that is called terrorism on the national news.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  They don't show you what happens.
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  This is your government,
[19:35.000 --> 19:40.000]  warts and all,
[19:40.000 --> 19:45.000]  under attack.
[19:45.000 --> 19:48.000]  To be replaced with something a thousand times worse.
[19:48.000 --> 19:50.000]  This is you under attack.
[19:50.000 --> 19:52.000]  They're going through that government
[19:52.000 --> 19:54.000]  and the checks and balances that are left to get you.
[19:54.000 --> 19:57.000]  And I have the incredible articles right here, mainstream news.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  Oh, thank God, Portland's standing up and so is the state.
[20:00.000 --> 20:03.000]  They're telling the feds you're not allowed to do anything.
[20:03.000 --> 20:06.000]  And imagine if Trump stands down
[20:06.000 --> 20:10.000]  and lets them burn down the federal building.
[20:10.000 --> 20:15.000]  That is what we're going to cover next hour.
[20:15.000 --> 20:17.000]  I have this from the APD.
[20:17.000 --> 20:19.000]  I have this from the state police.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  I have this from the governor's office,
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  the people that are disgusted by the governor
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  who has been blackmailed
[20:25.000 --> 20:29.000]  and Abbott has totally turned on us right now.
[20:29.000 --> 20:36.000]  And I have this from New York City
[20:36.000 --> 20:39.000]  and the federal government.
[20:39.000 --> 20:41.000]  And it's confirmed.
[20:41.000 --> 20:45.000]  What I'm going to cover at six after next hour.
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.000]  It makes me physically sick to my stomach
[20:48.000 --> 20:50.000]  to realize that we've gone this far
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  and we're in this situation.
[20:52.000 --> 20:56.000]  I'm just going to tell you right now what's coming up.
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  They have teams of literal,
[21:00.000 --> 21:03.000]  meth-head drug addicts, perverts, child molesters.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  That's the lowest level.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  They're almost all white.
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  They haven't been able to recruit blacks.
[21:09.000 --> 21:10.000]  Literally.
[21:10.000 --> 21:13.000]  They can get a few blacks wound up and pissed off,
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  get a few white people,
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  but they can't get them to dress up in black outfits
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  and go burn up random stuff.
[21:19.000 --> 21:22.000]  And so they're almost completely white.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  This is an interesting point.
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.000]  Groups under professors and government bureaucrats
[21:28.000 --> 21:30.000]  and big tech workers,
[21:30.000 --> 21:32.000]  as he keeps seeing it and arrested,
[21:32.000 --> 21:34.000]  as they're unmasked,
[21:34.000 --> 21:38.000]  are planning and they have lists of judges' houses,
[21:38.000 --> 21:42.000]  governor's mansions, capitals, media people,
[21:42.000 --> 21:44.000]  police chiefs they don't like,
[21:44.000 --> 21:46.000]  and they're going to come to your house
[21:46.000 --> 21:48.000]  and they've already got stolen trucks.
[21:48.000 --> 21:50.000]  They're going to load them up with gasoline
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  and they're just going to run them into your house full of gasoline,
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  burn your house down.
[21:55.000 --> 21:58.000]  When you come out, they're going to shoot you.
[21:58.000 --> 22:04.000]  And they think America is so weak that when they do this,
[22:04.000 --> 22:10.000]  they've got plans to go to conservative universities
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  and dump chlorine gas down the air conditioning vents.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  I mean, this is the stuff they're planning.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  And I mean, at a sick level,
[22:22.000 --> 22:24.000]  we've killed 62 million babies that were innocent,
[22:24.000 --> 22:26.000]  so it's like America's been asking for this.
[22:26.000 --> 22:29.000]  God's lifted his hedge of protection from the country.
[22:29.000 --> 22:32.000]  But I don't think these idiots that are part of this
[22:32.000 --> 22:34.000]  in this communist operation
[22:34.000 --> 22:36.000]  realize what's going to happen once they do this.
[22:36.000 --> 22:39.000]  Their bosses are going to hang them out to dry.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  I hope they don't do it.
[22:41.000 --> 22:48.000]  But I'm already starting to get into it.
[22:48.000 --> 22:50.000]  I'll just come for the next hour.
[22:50.000 --> 22:53.000]  Just people ask me, like, how are you handling CNN,
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.000]  MSNBC, ABC News, PBS attacking you every day,
[22:56.000 --> 22:58.000]  calling for your arrest, lying about you.
[22:58.000 --> 23:01.000]  And I'm like, in fact, I'm in a war zone
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  and bullets are flying over my head.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  We're all in this together.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  We're all in the trenches together.
[23:07.000 --> 23:13.000]  How am I handling it?
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  They are escalating violent confrontation
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  to set the precedent with everyone
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  that it's normal to burn buildings down
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  and shoot cops in the head and random citizens.
[23:21.000 --> 23:24.000]  And the city of Austin has their new budget,
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  pull this up if you can, guys,
[23:26.000 --> 23:29.000]  and calls for blowing up the...
[23:29.000 --> 23:32.000]  That's in the official budget certified by the mayor.
[23:32.000 --> 23:34.000]  They want... they're going to pass this
[23:34.000 --> 23:38.000]  and blow up the police department
[23:38.000 --> 23:40.000]  as a symbol of evil
[23:40.000 --> 23:44.000]  and to make police then be inside other agencies
[23:44.000 --> 23:50.000]  under other bureaucrats' control.
[23:50.000 --> 23:53.000]  So you can... you can talk about this all day long,
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  ladies and gentlemen. You don't understand.
[23:55.000 --> 23:56.000]  This is the takeover.
[23:56.000 --> 23:58.000]  And they think the police...
[23:58.000 --> 24:00.000]  This is all university programming.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  What's come out?
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  What's been going on for 50 years,
[24:04.000 --> 24:07.000]  but really intense the last 10?
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  They already have online training
[24:09.000 --> 24:12.000]  through the Soros front groups and the rest of it,
[24:12.000 --> 24:14.000]  where they've already identified
[24:14.000 --> 24:16.000]  nerds and kids that are scared
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  and kids that have Aspergers.
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.000]  They can be white, they can be black,
[24:20.000 --> 24:22.000]  they can be Hispanic, they can be Asian.
[24:22.000 --> 24:24.000]  They show up at the college
[24:24.000 --> 24:26.000]  and a person greets them and says,
[24:26.000 --> 24:28.000]  hey, there's KKK on the campus.
[24:28.000 --> 24:30.000]  They're going to attack you,
[24:30.000 --> 24:32.000]  none of this ever happens, none of it's real.
[24:32.000 --> 24:34.000]  We need to take you to an area to brief you on the trouble.
[24:34.000 --> 24:36.000]  They're taken to a dormitory, they're given food,
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  they're told it's really dangerous,
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  they're indoctrinated, they're shown videos,
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  the ADL produces, and so they're probably lost
[24:42.000 --> 24:44.000]  and they're scared.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  And then they're told,
[24:46.000 --> 24:48.000]  but it's okay, we're going to protect you.
[24:48.000 --> 24:50.000]  And then the left goes out and puts swastikas
[24:50.000 --> 24:52.000]  on their own buildings and, you know,
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  does all the false flagging with Jesse Smollett stuff,
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  the Bubba Wallace stuff
[24:56.000 --> 24:58.000]  to be able to actually create that fear.
[24:58.000 --> 25:00.000]  And now it's like a larping video game.
[25:00.000 --> 25:02.000]  And then they begin the process of radicalizing.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  Well, they're trying it with the police now,
[25:04.000 --> 25:06.000]  all over the country, they say,
[25:06.000 --> 25:08.000]  we're getting rid of your police departments,
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  you're going to now be broken up
[25:10.000 --> 25:12.000]  and be put under other city agencies,
[25:12.000 --> 25:14.000]  and then we're going to have people
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  that just manage you in those.
[25:16.000 --> 25:18.000]  And they believe the average cop
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  will then go under Stockholm syndrome
[25:20.000 --> 25:22.000]  and will go into these groups.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  It's actually a golden opportunity
[25:24.000 --> 25:26.000]  to go expose their criminal activity,
[25:26.000 --> 25:28.000]  but you've got to stop being such order followers.
[25:28.000 --> 25:30.000]  See, they got police from being
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  autonomous and in their own discretion
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  to having no discretion being robots the last 20 years.
[25:34.000 --> 25:36.000]  Now they just think they're robots,
[25:36.000 --> 25:38.000]  they're going to hand you over to the left,
[25:38.000 --> 25:40.000]  and you're going to follow all their orders.
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  You don't have to worry if there's nobody
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  above you to leak information.
[25:44.000 --> 25:46.000]  You don't have to worry if there's nobody there.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  You got to leak it yourself.
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  And believe me, you're going to be embedded
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  with child molesters, devil worshipers, criminals,
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  human traffickers, and they're going to try to buy you off
[25:54.000 --> 25:56.000]  and put you under their control.
[25:56.000 --> 25:58.000]  So, again,
[25:58.000 --> 26:00.000]  I've looked down every avenue of this,
[26:00.000 --> 26:02.000]  it's not going to go well, it's not going to work
[26:02.000 --> 26:04.000]  the way they think it is.
[26:04.000 --> 26:06.000]  But like all psychotic criminals,
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  they always think one step, not two steps,
[26:08.000 --> 26:10.000]  not 10 steps, not 100 steps.
[26:10.000 --> 26:12.000]  So they can see the immediate power
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  of what
[26:14.000 --> 26:16.000]  of what they're about to do.
[26:16.000 --> 26:18.000]  So they're going to do all this,
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  but I haven't told you yet what's coming up next hour.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  Call everybody you know.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  Call your bat signal,
[26:24.000 --> 26:26.000]  call your bat signal being fired up.
[26:26.000 --> 26:28.000]  This is it.
[26:28.000 --> 26:30.000]  They are planning and are activating the units
[26:30.000 --> 26:32.000]  that are not just lazing targets now.
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  They are actively going
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  to judges' homes,
[26:36.000 --> 26:38.000]  police homes,
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  talk show host homes, members of congress homes,
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  and are preparing the groups
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  that are going to go in and burn down those places.
[26:44.000 --> 26:46.000]  Then they're going to have actual
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  professionals that kill the judges and police,
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  but they're going to hang the antifa out to dry.
[26:50.000 --> 26:51.000]  That's why they're decoys.
[26:51.000 --> 26:52.000]  They'll be right back.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  Stay with us.
[26:53.000 --> 27:01.360]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal, naturally fluoride-free,
[27:01.360 --> 27:03.240]  mouthwash, and toothpaste.
[27:03.240 --> 27:06.800]  And if you don't know what activated charcoal does, ladies and gentlemen, it naturally,
[27:06.800 --> 27:12.840]  in a clean way, strips away the toxins, the impurities, the plaque, and it doesn't damage
[27:12.840 --> 27:13.840]  the enamel.
[27:13.840 --> 27:14.840]  That's really important.

[27:40.400 --> 27:45.320]  Over a year ago, I tried charcoal toothpaste from a major brand and thought it was amazing.
[27:45.320 --> 27:48.160]  And I went to my dad and people said, I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste that
[27:48.160 --> 27:50.160]  doesn't have all the silica and all these fillers in it.
[27:50.160 --> 27:51.400]  Very strong toothpaste.
[27:51.400 --> 27:52.960]  You've never used anything like it.

[27:56.240 --> 28:00.000]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day.
[28:00.000 --> 28:01.000]  It's really strong.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.160]  I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates.
[28:03.160 --> 28:07.120]  Jack, a really aggressive boy, and the coffee adds to it, but, mmm, wake up America coffee
[28:07.120 --> 28:08.120]  there by loves.
[28:08.120 --> 28:09.840]  Highest rated in the Chiapas Mountains.
[28:09.840 --> 28:12.040]  It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[28:12.040 --> 28:13.040]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[28:13.040 --> 28:15.840]  It's right on the border between the two countries in those rainforests.
[28:15.840 --> 28:16.840]  Hand selected.
[28:16.840 --> 28:17.840]  It's beyond organic.
[28:17.840 --> 28:18.840]  Wildcrafted.
[28:18.840 --> 28:19.840]  Wake up America coffee.
[28:19.840 --> 28:21.280]  People are blown away by how good it is.
[28:21.280 --> 28:25.400]  Same stuff sold in Whole Foods on another name for $30 for the same size container.
[28:25.400 --> 28:26.400]  Yes, folks.
[28:26.400 --> 28:27.400]  We've been selling it 10 years.
[28:27.400 --> 28:28.400]  Never raised the price.
[28:28.400 --> 28:35.200]  $19.95 for that big old bag, 99% reviews, 598 reviews, 4.9 stars on third-party sites.
[28:35.200 --> 28:37.200]  Sign up for AutoShip, additional 10% off.

[28:38.200 --> 28:40.120]  Don't forget to get it each month or every two months.
[28:40.120 --> 28:43.280]  You can click out to nine months whenever you want the new order coming in.
[28:43.280 --> 28:44.640]  15 days, nine months.
[28:44.640 --> 28:47.480]  Patriots blend medium roast.
[28:47.480 --> 28:51.200]  Only has a 98% out of 814 reviews.
[28:51.200 --> 28:53.000]  It's not as popular.
[28:53.000 --> 28:56.040]  Anyways, it's all at infowarstore.com.
[28:56.040 --> 29:01.960]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[29:01.960 --> 29:06.360]  Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[29:06.360 --> 29:11.800]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world-government COVID takeover.
[29:11.800 --> 29:17.400]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.160]  and will defeat them and will smash them.
[29:20.160 --> 29:27.440]  And the good news is there are still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com,
[29:27.440 --> 29:31.720]  Paul Watson Sites Summit.News, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive
[29:31.720 --> 29:39.200]  traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master
[29:39.200 --> 29:41.840]  of our own destinies.
[29:41.840 --> 29:46.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health,
[29:46.560 --> 29:48.680]  a war on our economy.
[29:48.680 --> 29:53.160]  But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[29:53.160 --> 29:58.520]  So take action or be slaves.
[29:58.520 --> 30:05.520]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:28.520 --> 30:39.080]  We are Backline Broadcasting Worldline, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[30:39.080 --> 30:47.880]  This is from the actual Austin City budget proposed by the city manager and the mayor
[30:47.880 --> 30:50.520]  expedite the demolition of the APD headquarters.
[30:50.520 --> 30:52.800]  That's an actual quote.
[30:52.800 --> 31:00.000]  People saw our headline yesterday on infowars.com and they thought it was the onion.
[31:00.000 --> 31:06.000]  Austin City Council officially calls for blowing up police station as symbol of ending police
[31:06.000 --> 31:07.000]  hate.
[31:07.000 --> 31:10.280]  They say the police are hate.
[31:10.280 --> 31:15.640]  Imagine just a whole group of people, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, you're just all
[31:15.640 --> 31:19.480]  bad.
[31:19.480 --> 31:28.120]  And then in Portland, $500 an hour fines because the feds have a fence up, oh, the chop people
[31:28.120 --> 31:31.680]  and all the rest of them, they can block roads in Seattle and Portland, they can kill people,
[31:31.680 --> 31:32.680]  they can shoot people.
[31:32.680 --> 31:39.200]  But oh, if the feds on the sidewalk put up a fence so they don't have to beat people
[31:39.200 --> 31:49.320]  trying to kill them, well, it's called hurting peaceful demonstrators, you know.
[31:49.320 --> 31:54.160]  I'm sorry, I misspoke, I was one for a member, they put the article up.
[31:54.160 --> 31:55.160]  It's worse than I said.
[31:55.160 --> 31:59.200]  You know, usually people think I'm exaggerating every hour, $500, I'm sorry.
[31:59.200 --> 32:07.200]  Portland finds federal government $500 for every 15 minutes.
[32:07.200 --> 32:12.160]  So that's $2,000 an hour, excuse me.
[32:12.160 --> 32:17.760]  Fake news, I got caught again, somehow my brain thought $500 an hour, I'm sorry.
[32:17.760 --> 32:24.800]  They pull the article up, $500 every 15 minutes.
[32:24.800 --> 32:30.360]  You know, they're finding on death certificates, $10,000 plus children a week are starving
[32:30.360 --> 32:33.680]  to death because of the COVID-19 lockdown.
[32:33.680 --> 32:36.720]  Now you know they don't use to put that on the death certificate, it's usually malnutrition
[32:36.720 --> 32:39.840]  or they say they died of the flu or a cold because they're so run down.
[32:39.840 --> 32:43.360]  I mean, it's hundreds of thousands a week.
[32:43.360 --> 32:48.680]  And that's the UN's admitting that they want money from you to now go feed the people starving
[32:48.680 --> 32:50.720]  because they cut the economy off.
[32:50.720 --> 32:55.640]  It's like you live by the beach, they come take your fishing pole, they burn down your
[32:55.640 --> 32:59.240]  shack and then they say, oh, give us money, we need to feed the old man that lives by
[32:59.240 --> 33:01.240]  the sea.
[33:01.240 --> 33:04.440]  I'm going to stop right now.
[33:04.440 --> 33:09.480]  I have confirmed federal, state, and local what we already can see and know.
[33:09.480 --> 33:14.680]  They're being conditioned to not respond and that it's bad and respond as the violence
[33:14.680 --> 33:19.120]  at anti-fund BLM checkpoints all over the country.
[33:19.120 --> 33:24.760]  Shoot innocent people, shoot at cars, shoot cops, 20-something dead cops now, shoot hundreds
[33:24.760 --> 33:25.760]  of their own people.
[33:25.760 --> 33:30.120]  It's like 20-something the last few days, hundreds and hundreds a week in Chicago,
[33:30.120 --> 33:34.280]  hundreds and hundreds these other cities.
[33:34.280 --> 33:35.280]  Everything's breaking down.
[33:35.280 --> 33:40.960]  Everything is basically doubled on average.
[33:40.960 --> 33:44.600]  Almost everyone I know has had their house robbed or their car robbed.
[33:44.600 --> 33:50.040]  I know all these people that are out of jobs for three, four months that are going bankrupt.
[33:50.040 --> 34:00.320]  I have family that has trouble paying their bills and we're being told everything's wonderful.
[34:00.320 --> 34:08.000]  That the feds, federal marshals, just regular people using them in the military, just go
[34:08.000 --> 34:12.360]  get a job, work for the government, that they're the threat, oh, oh, yeah.
[34:12.360 --> 34:16.520]  Not the chai comms, not the globalists, not the pedophile rings, but just the federal
[34:16.520 --> 34:17.520]  marshals.
[34:17.520 --> 34:20.680]  No, the threat is the lawyers in the Justice Department.
[34:20.680 --> 34:25.800]  The threat is the lawyers in Congress that have sold America out and that think we're
[34:25.800 --> 34:30.680]  so stupid they're going to sit by while this country burns and they're not going to get
[34:30.680 --> 34:31.680]  the blame.
[34:31.680 --> 34:32.680]  They're gravely mistaken.
[34:32.680 --> 34:34.800]  Let me just play this because it's very important.
[34:34.800 --> 34:37.080]  AG Bar clashes with Dems.
[34:37.080 --> 34:39.880]  I don't have to play at the start of the next segment.
[34:39.880 --> 34:40.880]  It's so powerful.
[34:40.880 --> 34:45.600]  It's a little bit longer than the time we have.
[34:45.600 --> 34:50.640]  And then I'm going to control myself and I'm going to be a good boy and get into Bill Gates.
[34:50.640 --> 34:51.640]  I'll start getting into it now.
[34:51.640 --> 34:56.800]  Bill Gates has been hiding the last few months, very little interviews, now he's re-emerged
[34:56.800 --> 35:01.880]  like a moray eel out of his hole and he's going, it's preposterous.
[35:01.880 --> 35:08.200]  No one has any microchips.
[35:08.200 --> 35:10.200]  It's a digital tattoo.
[35:10.200 --> 35:15.920]  So it's a bunch of liquid chips, it's thousands of little chips, not one chip.
[35:15.920 --> 35:19.720]  But all those chips line up and have hundreds of times the data a chip could have.
[35:19.720 --> 35:21.400]  Each one is like the old microchip.
[35:21.400 --> 35:22.400]  It's miniaturized.
[35:22.400 --> 35:28.840]  Remember the old days when one song would take up half the room on your computer 20
[35:28.840 --> 35:29.840]  years ago?
[35:29.840 --> 35:33.920]  Now you can have a million songs on your computer.
[35:33.920 --> 35:38.200]  And so he's all over the news saying, I've got implantable digital ink we're going to
[35:38.200 --> 35:43.400]  inject in you in the vaccine after you get the vaccine in a patch we put on you that
[35:43.400 --> 35:45.400]  puts it into your skin.
[35:45.400 --> 35:50.000]  But then he's separately going, oh, I'm a victim and Fauci's a victim and they're talking
[35:50.000 --> 35:56.560]  mean about us and lying and saying we're involved at Wuhan and we're involved with Epstein
[35:56.560 --> 36:01.240]  and we're involved with microchips proving you've had vaccines and we're involved in
[36:01.240 --> 36:02.740]  forced inoculations.
[36:02.740 --> 36:08.880]  And then all of his writers and the official Microsoft website and BBC and AP and Reuters
[36:08.880 --> 36:13.040]  are all, you're going to have to have a digital tattoo proving you have the shot before you
[36:13.040 --> 36:17.560]  can fly on an airplane or eventually have a job and contact tracers are coming to your
[36:17.560 --> 36:23.760]  house and we need to take your kids away from you out of their mouths.
[36:23.760 --> 36:31.000]  And then they think because they have a CNN or a New York Times article or a front line
[36:31.000 --> 36:35.920]  with that famous voiceover guy, you know, going Jones clan, there was a world government
[36:35.920 --> 36:38.600]  Jones clan, there were plans to make you take shots.
[36:38.600 --> 36:43.920]  They say stuff like this, everybody's going, well, they're doing that right now.
[36:43.920 --> 36:47.760]  So see, they had a police state plan to have the police and military come take your guns
[36:47.760 --> 36:49.760]  and do all this, but they wouldn't do it.
[36:49.760 --> 36:54.840]  In fact, the ADL training did more than Alex Jones ever did to wake the cops up because
[36:54.840 --> 36:57.560]  I told the cops 20 something years ago this was happening.
[36:57.560 --> 36:59.920]  I attacked the police because I thought they were taking the training.
[36:59.920 --> 37:00.920]  I wasn't sophisticated.
[37:00.920 --> 37:01.920]  I thought they were accepting it.
[37:01.920 --> 37:03.840]  So I just said, well, they're under their control.
[37:03.840 --> 37:04.840]  They're the enemy.
[37:04.840 --> 37:05.840]  Get ready on average.
[37:05.840 --> 37:07.000]  The cops went, we're not the enemy.
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.520]  You're making this up Jones.
[37:08.520 --> 37:11.440]  And then they went like, what the hell, this is true, we're not doing this.
[37:11.440 --> 37:15.760]  They all got educated and now they're the number one enemy because I told you the most
[37:15.760 --> 37:22.280]  awake group in the country is the police because they get taken to ADL and Southern
[37:22.280 --> 37:28.880]  Poverty Law Center events and the, and the captains go to these things and they go, hey,
[37:28.880 --> 37:30.280]  come have a steak dinner with us.
[37:30.280 --> 37:32.000]  Hey, want to make a little extra money in your town?
[37:32.000 --> 37:33.000]  We got a business for you.
[37:33.000 --> 37:36.040]  And it's actually mafia trying to hire them for criminal activity.
[37:36.040 --> 37:39.560]  You don't think the somebody lost their didn't reach out to me?
[37:39.560 --> 37:44.200]  Come on, they got billions.
[37:44.200 --> 37:49.280]  And next the cops are like, you're offering me a hooker, the finest hooker I ever seen
[37:49.280 --> 37:50.280]  in my life.
[37:50.280 --> 37:51.280]  What's going on here?
[37:51.280 --> 37:53.920]  And almost all the cops refuse.
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.240]  Just like they had to admit in the Russian investigation, they couldn't get one American.
[37:58.240 --> 38:01.880]  They approached over 2000 people, including me.
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.240]  They couldn't get one American to take Russian money.
[38:05.240 --> 38:06.920]  And of course it wasn't Russians.
[38:06.920 --> 38:08.400]  It was the globalist.
[38:08.400 --> 38:12.800]  They couldn't get, gosh, think about how loyal we are.
[38:12.800 --> 38:18.360]  They couldn't get one person to take their money.
[38:18.360 --> 38:20.080]  But see, that's because we're Americans.
[38:20.080 --> 38:21.080]  We're patriots.
[38:21.080 --> 38:22.080]  We're conservatives.
[38:22.080 --> 38:23.080]  We're Christians.
[38:23.080 --> 38:24.320]  But they, oh, the left doesn't even want money.
[38:24.320 --> 38:31.320]  They just want to watch the country burn and then they'll be happy to do it all.
[38:31.320 --> 38:36.520]  The average leftist can't even imagine being offered $10 million to sell your people off
[38:36.520 --> 38:41.040]  for $3 million from the quote, Russians, and it's not the Russians.
[38:41.040 --> 38:44.040]  You people are pathetic.
[38:44.040 --> 38:47.840]  The left, I'm sure I'm talking to you, you're sick because you spiritually are blinded.
[38:47.840 --> 38:51.600]  You gave up your entire birthright for nothing.
[38:51.600 --> 38:53.760]  So I don't even hate you.
[38:53.760 --> 38:55.920]  You're just disgusting.
[38:55.920 --> 39:00.840]  You're like a rotting dead animal in the sun with maggots all over it.
[39:00.840 --> 39:06.120]  And you just want to force your way on us and rape us with your vaccines and your toxic
[39:06.120 --> 39:09.080]  culture and your pedophilia and all of it.
[39:09.080 --> 39:10.880]  And we're rejecting you.
[39:10.880 --> 39:13.160]  So fire every weapon you've got.
[39:13.160 --> 39:14.160]  Do everything.
[39:14.160 --> 39:15.160]  Lie.
[39:15.160 --> 39:16.160]  Say we're fake.
[39:16.160 --> 39:18.320]  Say we're the bad guys.
[39:18.320 --> 39:20.080]  Everyone knows that truth.
[39:20.080 --> 39:23.960]  You are the bad people.
[39:23.960 --> 39:25.680]  So hurt me.
[39:25.680 --> 39:26.680]  Hurt us.
[39:26.680 --> 39:27.680]  We're men.
[39:27.680 --> 39:29.680]  We can take it.
[39:29.680 --> 39:36.080]  Because when you're done, when you're out of breath, just like the end of each of
[39:36.080 --> 39:37.080]  us.
[39:37.080 --> 39:39.760]  He says the only way we're similar is we're both about to be dead.
[39:39.760 --> 39:42.520]  I'm here to be expended on you.
[39:42.520 --> 39:46.200]  I don't fear death like you.
[39:46.200 --> 39:55.120]  So you're going to fear very, very soon.
[39:55.120 --> 39:56.560]  It's Christmas in July.
[39:56.560 --> 39:57.760]  We ran the sale last year.
[39:57.760 --> 39:59.560]  It was very, very popular.
[39:59.560 --> 40:04.480]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important
[40:04.480 --> 40:05.480]  election year.
[40:05.480 --> 40:11.360]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[40:11.360 --> 40:17.040]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[40:17.040 --> 40:20.040]  And the shirts are on sale right now in FullerStore.com.
[40:20.040 --> 40:25.480]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign, having a similar shirt to media called Nazi, which
[40:25.480 --> 40:26.480]  of course it isn't.
[40:26.480 --> 40:29.480]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and the globalist, well, we're going to make
[40:29.480 --> 40:34.280]  sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise our First
[40:34.280 --> 40:36.400]  Amendment in the face of each time.
[40:36.400 --> 40:39.640]  We also have store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[40:39.640 --> 40:44.320]  So whatever great item it is that you want, store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points
[40:44.320 --> 40:47.800]  on your next order, and at least 50% off across the board.
[40:47.800 --> 40:51.160]  Now I'm going to have to end this sale very, very soon because all these products are about
[40:51.160 --> 40:52.160]  to sell out.
[40:52.160 --> 40:55.160]  Just take advantage of it right now in FullerStore.com.

[41:00.280 --> 41:03.480]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[41:03.480 --> 41:06.900]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks, so they're saying three to four
[41:06.900 --> 41:07.900]  weeks.
[41:07.900 --> 41:08.900]  It's my patriot.
[41:08.900 --> 41:09.900]  We have their full catalog.

[41:22.520 --> 41:24.560]  whether Trump wins or loses.
[41:24.560 --> 41:28.600]  The globalists have already created a world-wide depression, lockdowns on the planetary scale,
[41:28.600 --> 41:30.520]  and it's only intensifying.
[41:30.520 --> 41:32.400]  This is one of the big boxes.
[41:32.400 --> 41:35.120]  You've got to get checked off as high-quality store-double food.
[41:35.120 --> 41:40.240]  My patriot has really good, high-quality food at a very affordable price, and the packaging
[41:40.240 --> 41:42.480]  is the best you're going to find out there.

[41:56.560 --> 42:06.080]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.

[42:13.840 --> 42:20.880]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[42:20.880 --> 42:21.880]  in males.

[42:40.080 --> 42:45.120]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.

[42:51.400 --> 42:55.000]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWareStore.com.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.920]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[42:59.920 --> 43:00.920]  Hello, can you hear me?
[43:00.920 --> 43:01.920]  I'm sure you can, sir, thank you.
[43:01.920 --> 43:07.280]  Hey, Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to
[43:07.280 --> 43:08.280]  be talking right now.
[43:08.280 --> 43:09.280]  Yeah, man.
[43:09.280 --> 43:10.280]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[43:10.280 --> 43:15.240]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in, um, I'm a truck driver and
[43:15.240 --> 43:20.720]  two before us have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, there's a
[43:20.720 --> 43:28.000]  couple of us, uh, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.760]  Red Bull and Rola and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just
[43:32.760 --> 43:33.960]  want to thank you for that, man.
[43:33.960 --> 43:38.560]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[43:38.560 --> 43:39.560]  there is.
[43:39.560 --> 43:42.480]  So this, this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name
[43:42.480 --> 43:45.440]  on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this
[43:45.440 --> 43:49.240]  formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest, but
[43:49.240 --> 43:53.160]  healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means
[43:53.160 --> 43:54.160]  a lot to me.
[43:54.160 --> 43:55.160]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[43:55.160 --> 43:56.160]  We love you.
[43:56.160 --> 44:17.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[44:17.160 --> 44:38.640]  We have the obligation to protect federal courts and the U.S. marshals specifically have been
[44:38.640 --> 44:40.560]  given that obligation.
[44:40.560 --> 44:42.160]  Federal courts are under attack.
[44:42.160 --> 44:47.640]  Just when is it okay to try to burn down a federal court?
[44:47.640 --> 44:51.520]  If someone went down the street to the Prettyman Court here, that beautiful courthouse we have
[44:51.520 --> 44:55.920]  right at the bottom of the hill and started breaking windows and firing industrial-grade
[44:55.920 --> 45:01.960]  fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in and start fires in the court,
[45:01.960 --> 45:02.960]  is that okay?
[45:02.960 --> 45:08.960]  General Boy, your opening statement reads like it was written by Alex Jones or Roger
[45:08.960 --> 45:09.960]  Stone.
[45:09.960 --> 45:15.040]  No, the U.S. marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse, and that's
[45:15.040 --> 45:17.000]  what we are doing in Portland.
[45:17.000 --> 45:20.120]  We are at the courthouse defending the courthouse.
[45:20.120 --> 45:22.120]  We're not out looking for trouble.
[45:22.120 --> 45:28.800]  As far as weapons and devices that were utilized by the group of people, and you mentioned trying
[45:28.800 --> 45:35.160]  to destroy the courthouse, I mean they were literally trying to burn it down, and apparently
[45:35.160 --> 45:39.760]  didn't give a hoot about the people that were occupied in the building as well, so people
[45:39.760 --> 45:40.760]  were in danger.
[45:40.760 --> 45:42.360]  That is absolutely right.
[45:42.360 --> 45:46.520]  So as far as the weapons that you mentioned, let me get this straight.
[45:46.520 --> 45:52.520]  My understanding is that the people attacking the building had, among other things, rifles,
[45:52.520 --> 46:01.360]  explosives, knives, saws, sledgehammers, tasers, slingshots, rocks, bricks, lasers.
[46:01.360 --> 46:04.000]  Have I missed anything or is that about cover it?
[46:04.000 --> 46:07.080]  You have missed some things, but that's a good list.
[46:07.080 --> 46:10.400]  But you know, they have these powerful slingshots with ball bearings that they shoot.
[46:10.400 --> 46:12.400]  They've used pellet guns, we believe.
[46:12.400 --> 46:21.640]  We have found those projectiles that have penetrated marshals to the bone, and they
[46:21.640 --> 46:26.840]  use the lasers to blind the marshals.
[46:26.840 --> 46:28.360]  Tom at the courthouse is just down the street.
[46:28.360 --> 46:31.840]  What if they decided, do you think that this body right here would rise up if they decided
[46:31.840 --> 46:35.440]  to go tonight and paint the Capitol building?
[46:35.440 --> 46:36.640]  This body, I'm not sure.
[46:36.640 --> 46:37.640]  I think this side would.
[46:37.640 --> 46:38.640]  I'm not sure.
[46:38.640 --> 46:39.640]  Yeah, this side, other side.
[46:39.640 --> 46:40.640]  I'm not so sure.
[46:40.640 --> 46:42.920]  It may be the peaceful protest to burn down the Capitol.
[46:42.920 --> 46:44.880]  Maybe we're back to 1812 again.
[46:44.880 --> 46:46.200]  They do start fires.
[46:46.200 --> 46:50.760]  They start fires if they can get into the fire inside or through the windows, and they
[46:50.760 --> 46:55.960]  start fires along the outside of the courthouse.
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.960]  When the marshals come out to try to deal with the fire, they're assaulted.
[47:00.960 --> 47:08.800]  General, if local elected officials, mayors and city councils and governors did their
[47:08.800 --> 47:15.120]  jobs and kept the peace, would it even be necessary for federal law enforcement personnel
[47:15.120 --> 47:16.680]  to be there in the first place?
[47:16.680 --> 47:18.400]  No, and that's exactly the point.
[47:18.400 --> 47:20.000]  Look around the country.
[47:20.000 --> 47:26.160]  Even where there are these kinds of riots occurring, we haven't had to put in the kind
[47:26.160 --> 47:31.680]  of reinforcements that we have in Portland because the state and local law enforcement
[47:31.680 --> 47:38.160]  does their job and won't allow rioters to come and just physically assault the courthouse.
[47:38.160 --> 47:40.560]  In Portland, that's not the case.
[47:40.560 --> 47:44.640]  You really can't hide behind legal fictions this time, Mr. Barr.
[47:44.640 --> 47:49.160]  It's all out in the open, where the people can see what you are doing for themselves.
[47:49.160 --> 47:53.760]  The president wants footage for his campaign ads, and you appear to be serving it up to
[47:53.760 --> 47:56.120]  him as ordered.
[47:56.120 --> 48:01.160]  In most of these cities, the protest had begun to wind down before you marched in and confronted
[48:01.160 --> 48:05.320]  the protesters, and the protesters aren't mobs.
[48:05.320 --> 48:08.760]  They are mothers and veterans and mayors.
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.520]  In this moment, real leadership would entail de-escalation, collaboration and looking for
[48:13.520 --> 48:16.720]  ways to peaceably resolve our differences.
[48:16.720 --> 48:21.360]  Instead, you use pepper spray and truncheons on American citizens.
[48:21.360 --> 48:23.280]  You did it here in Washington.
[48:23.280 --> 48:25.160]  You did it at Lafayette Square.
[48:25.160 --> 48:32.360]  You expanded to Portland, and now you are projecting fear and violence nationwide in pursuit of
[48:32.360 --> 48:34.960]  obvious political objectives.
[48:34.960 --> 48:35.960]  Shame on you, Mr. Barr.
[48:35.960 --> 48:36.960]  Can I just say, Mr. Barr?
[48:36.960 --> 48:37.960]  Shame on you.
[48:37.960 --> 48:38.960]  My time has expired.
[48:38.960 --> 48:44.320]  The vast majority of protesters are peaceful, and despite that, unidentified federal agents
[48:44.320 --> 48:49.440]  have attempted to prevent these mothers, veterans and peaceful Americans from exercising their
[48:49.440 --> 48:54.480]  First Amendment rights, even using unmarked vehicles to grab protesters off the street
[48:54.480 --> 48:57.240]  and using tear gas ammunitions against them.
[48:57.240 --> 49:01.600]  You've forcefully condemned protesters this morning, but let me ask you, sir, why have
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.120]  you not condemned the federal officers you're sending into cities without proper training
[49:06.120 --> 49:12.240]  who are attempting to take away the constitutional rights of Americans peacefully protesting?
[49:12.240 --> 49:15.040]  I haven't condemned protesters.
[49:15.040 --> 49:16.600]  Protesters are good.
[49:16.600 --> 49:17.600]  Demonstrations are good.
[49:17.600 --> 49:18.600]  They're part of the First Amendment.
[49:18.600 --> 49:21.920]  What I'm condemning is people who commit crime.
[49:21.920 --> 49:27.280]  One of America's most beloved and effective protesters, John Lewis, lies in state a thousand
[49:27.280 --> 49:30.320]  feet from here in a deserved place of honor.
[49:30.320 --> 49:34.680]  And sir, your failure to respect the role of peaceful protest in this country is a disgrace.
[49:34.680 --> 49:37.960]  It's un-American, and it's important to remember what these protests are about.
[49:37.960 --> 49:39.120]  Black lives matter.
[49:39.120 --> 49:44.560]  You seem to have a difficult time understanding systemic racism and institutional racism that
[49:44.560 --> 49:46.840]  has plagued so many.
[49:46.840 --> 49:53.520]  I don't think we've ever had a hearing where the witness wasn't allowed to respond to points
[49:53.520 --> 49:57.920]  made, questions asked, and attacks made.
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.120]  Not just in this hearing, not just in this committee, but every committee had been on.
[50:01.120 --> 50:04.640]  So particularly when you think about the fact we've got the Attorney General of the United
[50:04.640 --> 50:05.640]  States here.
[50:05.640 --> 50:08.120]  The gentleman does not have the time.
[50:08.120 --> 50:09.120]  I don't want the time.
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.720]  I just want the Attorney General to be able to have enough time to respond to accusations
[50:13.720 --> 50:17.480]  and questions asked him, and you guys not cut him off.
[50:17.480 --> 50:20.720]  What you want is irrelevant.
[50:20.720 --> 50:32.440]  Powerful highlights, A.G. Bart clashes with Dems, the best highlights.
[50:32.440 --> 50:35.680]  He then, after five and a half hours, asked to go to the bathroom, and he said, no, you
[50:35.680 --> 50:39.000]  don't go to the bathroom.
[50:39.000 --> 50:44.360]  Then pressed it in it because these criminals that sold America out, the Chai Combs and others,
[50:44.360 --> 50:45.360]  are scared.
[50:45.360 --> 50:46.360]  They own the media.
[50:46.360 --> 50:52.800]  They've stolen the wealth of the country, but they can't control our minds if we're aware
[50:52.800 --> 50:54.480]  of the enemy.
[50:54.480 --> 50:57.280]  And Mr. Nadler is, if anything, an enemy of America.
[50:57.280 --> 50:58.280]  He's not a traitor.
[50:58.280 --> 50:59.280]  He's never been an American.
[50:59.280 --> 51:06.240]  He's a globalist, sycophant parasite, and he's scared.
[51:06.240 --> 51:12.800]  Now, frankly, he should be because he's committed a lot of crimes.
[51:12.800 --> 51:15.280]  All right.
[51:15.280 --> 51:25.720]  If you tuned into our TV feed right now, you probably noticed that I've got a 300 Win
[51:25.720 --> 51:34.960]  Mag semi-automatic sweetheart and a 338 Lapua semi-auto sweetheart, and I can drive nails
[51:34.960 --> 51:41.840]  with these at 400 yards, and I could shoot an elephant a mile away.
[51:41.840 --> 51:45.520]  And I don't have these up here to offensively do anything.
[51:45.520 --> 51:57.760]  I just want to set the stage for what I'm going to cover next hour.
[51:57.760 --> 52:09.040]  I've got the teletypes right here from the APD and the state police and the FBI and Eastern
[52:09.040 --> 52:21.960]  District of New York that Antifa is 100% preparing terror attacks, I mean mass shootings, bombings,
[52:21.960 --> 52:28.680]  fire bombings all over the U.S., and are even organizing and preparing, and local police
[52:28.680 --> 52:35.800]  have informants in the groups, and when they go tell the mayors, and they go tell the FBI,
[52:35.800 --> 52:38.400]  they're told, stand down.
[52:38.400 --> 52:42.040]  You know, that's Barr's problem, though.
[52:42.040 --> 52:51.640]  They had Bush Sr., the Clintons, Bush Jr., then Obama for almost 30 years, folks, almost
[52:51.640 --> 52:55.320]  all the managers, 90% of the managers are globalists.
[52:55.320 --> 52:57.800]  The average FBI agent or average federal marshal is a good person.
[52:57.800 --> 53:01.800]  I mean, I've met them, I know them, but if anything, they follow orders too much and
[53:01.800 --> 53:02.800]  are too good.
[53:02.800 --> 53:09.280]  And by that, I mean, they're just, they're like robots.
[53:09.280 --> 53:10.280]  They're not rebels.
[53:10.280 --> 53:12.120]  Well, this is the time for rebels like George Washington.
[53:12.120 --> 53:17.080]  We're not looking for people that follow orders from illegitimate globalists on top of them
[53:17.080 --> 53:21.400]  in between the commander in chief.
[53:21.400 --> 53:27.400]  If my crew did not do what I asked them to do, we would shut down in days, and they put
[53:27.400 --> 53:30.800]  up with me, and I make mistakes too, but they understand that they respect me, they think
[53:30.800 --> 53:33.800]  overall I probably know more than they do, so they do what I tell them, even though sometimes
[53:33.800 --> 53:34.800]  I'm wrong.
[53:34.800 --> 53:36.280]  If they didn't do that, we shut down overnight.
[53:36.280 --> 53:38.040]  I listen to what they have to say as well.
[53:38.040 --> 53:43.920]  Can you imagine Trump, when 80% of the people working for him don't just not do what he
[53:43.920 --> 53:46.320]  says, they work against him?
[53:46.320 --> 53:50.240]  And now you've got the blue cities, the blue states, the Democrats, the globalists, Hollywood,
[53:50.240 --> 53:57.360]  the Chicoms, the EU, all of this, and the big corporations, big tech, all working to
[53:57.360 --> 54:00.520]  suppress the president and suppress the American people.
[54:00.520 --> 54:06.720]  And now doctors that have been suppressed in Texas and California and Michigan and Florida
[54:06.720 --> 54:13.800]  and Missouri, they all show up and have a press conference, and it's banned on every platform
[54:13.800 --> 54:19.640]  after the president tweets it, and they tell the president, you do it again, you're banned.
[54:19.640 --> 54:21.680]  That's where we've gotten to.
[54:21.680 --> 54:22.680]  That's who we are.
[54:22.680 --> 54:24.680]  We are in slavery.
[54:24.680 --> 54:26.160]  We have a beachhead that's Trump.
[54:26.160 --> 54:30.080]  We have ourselves that are beachheads, but we must recognize we're under globalist attack.
[54:30.080 --> 54:32.000]  We must recognize we're occupied.
[54:32.000 --> 54:35.280]  We must recognize we're in a war.
[54:35.280 --> 54:38.240]  And the enemy knows they're losing, they're getting ready to go high.
[54:38.240 --> 54:44.960]  We forced them into this, but now we have to get ready.
[54:44.960 --> 54:52.320]  There are only a few days left to take advantage of the biggest info war sale of 2020 so far.
[54:52.320 --> 54:56.640]  It is Christmas in July, and July ends this Friday.
[54:56.640 --> 55:02.400]  The longest we can run it is a few extra days until Sunday, because we are selling out of
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.960]  almost all of our best-selling products, and the supply chain is breaking down with many
[55:07.960 --> 55:13.760]  of our manufacturers, and so a lot of the reorders are held up months.
[55:13.760 --> 55:19.720]  In many cases, this could be the last chance you've got in the year 2020 to get these amazing
[55:19.720 --> 55:24.480]  products that empower you and your family's life and health, your immune systems, you
[55:24.480 --> 55:32.080]  name it, your stamina, your libido, your focus, but also, you know, funds the info war and
[55:32.080 --> 55:36.000]  everything we're doing to save this republic from the clutches of the globalists in the
[55:36.000 --> 55:37.000]  New World Order.
[55:37.000 --> 55:41.800]  All of our best-selling items, 50% off, store it for shipping, double-pantry points, take
[55:41.800 --> 55:46.120]  advantage of it right now while there's still time.
[55:46.120 --> 55:51.080]  Whether you believe in evolution in the modern theory or not, the globalist controllers
[55:51.080 --> 55:52.080]  do.
[55:52.080 --> 55:57.080]  They constantly write about and talk about how they want to create a global crisis or
[55:57.080 --> 56:02.720]  a group of crises that force humans to, quote, evolve in a new, better way.
[56:02.720 --> 56:06.480]  Now, when you study how they actually want you to evolve, you believe in that, it is
[56:06.480 --> 56:10.600]  to stop having children and birds with silicon bodies and a post-human future.
[56:10.600 --> 56:17.280]  Talk about psychotic, talk about creepy, talk about crazy, but they need an event like COVID-19
[56:17.280 --> 56:22.640]  to teach a mammal to wear some covering over its nose, over its breathing tubes to set
[56:22.640 --> 56:28.320]  the precedent for the forced inoculations, for the GMO, for the 5G, and for all the things
[56:28.320 --> 56:31.720]  that they admit will end our humanity as we know it.
[56:31.720 --> 56:33.000]  That's why this is so evil.
[56:33.000 --> 56:38.800]  Their whole agenda for a cashless society, global government, UN control, getting us
[56:38.800 --> 56:43.360]  all into debt, getting rid of local government, think about all the facts and some of the
[56:43.360 --> 56:48.960]  censorship, the surveillance.
[56:48.960 --> 56:55.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[56:55.680 --> 57:14.360]  Mr. Chairman, could we take a five-minute break, Mr. Chairman?
[57:14.360 --> 57:15.360]  No.
[57:15.360 --> 57:18.680]  That's a common courtesy, Mr. Chairman, of every witness.
[57:18.680 --> 57:24.800]  I waited 45, an hour for you this morning, I haven't had lunch, I'd like to take a five-minute
[57:24.800 --> 57:25.800]  break.
[57:25.800 --> 57:28.080]  Mr. Attorney General, we are almost finished.
[57:28.080 --> 57:33.200]  We're going to be finished in a few minutes.
[57:33.200 --> 57:35.280]  We can certainly take a break, but...
[57:35.280 --> 57:36.280]  You're real.
[57:36.280 --> 57:37.280]  You're classmate.
[57:37.280 --> 57:38.280]  Yeah.
[57:38.280 --> 57:41.400]  After this, if you still want one, we'll have a break.
[57:41.400 --> 57:46.000]  No, he wants a break now, and you just meant to be rudeness, I think we're seeing it on
[57:46.000 --> 57:47.000]  display.
[57:47.000 --> 57:48.960]  Let's let the Attorney General have a break.
[57:48.960 --> 57:50.520]  The committee will stand and recess it now.
[57:50.520 --> 57:51.520]  Thank you.
[57:51.520 --> 57:52.520]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[57:52.520 --> 58:05.720]  I think you could be forgiven for being confused.
[58:05.720 --> 58:09.720]  Operation Legend appears to be little more than a repackaging of existing operations
[58:09.720 --> 58:11.400]  in these cities.
[58:11.400 --> 58:12.920]  So why all the drama?
[58:12.920 --> 58:16.800]  Why join the president at the White House to announce a bold new operation that appears
[58:16.800 --> 58:19.520]  to be neither bold nor new?
[58:19.520 --> 58:23.760]  Understandably, Americans are very suspicious of your motives here.
[58:23.760 --> 58:27.600]  There are those who believe you are sending federal law enforcement into these cities
[58:27.600 --> 58:32.800]  not to combat violent crime, but to help with the president's reelection efforts.
[58:32.800 --> 58:38.400]  The president has made clear that he wants conflict between protesters and police to
[58:38.400 --> 58:42.120]  be a central theme of his campaign.
[58:42.120 --> 58:48.640]  So let me ask you directly, Mr. Barr, yes or no, yes or no, did you rebrand existing
[58:48.640 --> 58:54.880]  projects under the Operation Legend in order to assist the president in an election year?
[58:54.880 --> 58:55.880]  I wouldn't call it.
[58:55.880 --> 59:00.480]  Mr. Attorney General, would you agree with me at least on principle that it is improper
[59:00.480 --> 59:05.780]  for the Department of Justice to divert resources and law enforcement personnel in an effort
[59:05.780 --> 59:08.280]  to assist the president's reelection campaign?
[59:08.280 --> 59:09.880]  No, Mr. Chairman.
[59:09.880 --> 59:16.840]  In the fall, we did inaugurate an anti-crime initiative because we were concerned about
[59:16.840 --> 59:22.480]  increasing violent crime in a number of cities, and we call that relentless pursuit.
[59:22.480 --> 59:28.520]  Unfortunately, COVID intervened, and our agents who were detailed for these assignments could
[59:28.520 --> 59:31.560]  not perform the operation.
[59:31.560 --> 59:39.320]  So the operation was squelched by COVID, so we couldn't complete or make much progress
[59:39.320 --> 59:41.160]  on relentless pursuit.
[59:41.160 --> 59:46.680]  However, in the intervening time, we saw violent crime continuing to rise, and a lot of that
[59:46.680 --> 59:52.360]  was triggered by the events after the death of George Floyd.
[59:52.360 --> 1:00:01.000]  So we did reboot the program after COVID started breaking, and we could commit the law enforcement
[1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:07.640]  resources to actually accomplish the mission, which is to reduce violent crime.
[1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:12.640]  Now, I regret that COVID interrupted our law enforcement activities, but it does not obviate
[1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:16.720]  the fact that there is serious violent crime in these cities.
[1:00:16.720 --> 1:00:24.560]  These police departments and mayors have been asking us for help, and we have put in additional
[1:00:24.560 --> 1:00:30.080]  federal agents and investigators to help deal with it.
[1:00:30.080 --> 1:00:35.760]  Now, yes or no, have you discussed the president's reelection campaign with the president or
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:38.560]  with any White House official or any surrogate of the president?
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:41.680]  Well, I'm not going to get into my discussions with the president.
[1:00:41.680 --> 1:00:43.440]  Well, have you discussed that topic with him?
[1:00:43.440 --> 1:00:44.440]  Yes or no?
[1:00:44.440 --> 1:00:45.920]  Not in relation to this program.
[1:00:45.920 --> 1:00:47.440]  I didn't ask that.
[1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:49.440]  I asked if you discussed that with the president.
[1:00:49.440 --> 1:00:52.240]  I'm a member of the cabinet, and there's an election going on.
[1:00:52.240 --> 1:00:53.760]  Obviously, the topic comes up.
[1:00:53.760 --> 1:00:54.760]  Yes.
[1:00:54.760 --> 1:00:57.400]  Well, the topic comes up in cabinet meetings and other things.
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:58.400]  Okay.
[1:00:58.400 --> 1:01:01.120]  It shouldn't be a surprise that the topic of the election...
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:02.120]  I didn't say I was surprised.
[1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:04.160]  I just asked if you've done that.
[1:01:04.160 --> 1:01:08.800]  So as part of those conversations with the president or his people about the reelection
[1:01:08.800 --> 1:01:15.440]  campaign, have you ever discussed the current or future deployment of federal law enforcement?
[1:01:15.440 --> 1:01:16.960]  In connection with what?
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:18.320]  In connection with what you just said.
[1:01:18.320 --> 1:01:19.320]  In connection with the...
[1:01:19.320 --> 1:01:21.520]  Oh, we've got to go to break.
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:27.440]  I'm going to lay out the big news when we come back, all right?
[1:01:27.440 --> 1:01:32.760]  And then I'm going to hit the latest force vaccine, World Government, World ID News,
[1:01:32.760 --> 1:01:36.360]  and really the biggest news ever is what I'm about to lay out.
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:39.640]  And I'm just really mad at myself right now.
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:44.520]  This is so big, and I just don't even know how to describe this, because it's so real.
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:48.520]  And I'm going to get attacked so bad for putting it out, and I don't care about that.
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:53.840]  I care about you understanding the psychological warfare.
[1:01:53.840 --> 1:01:59.320]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal, naturally fluoride-free,
[1:01:59.320 --> 1:02:00.320]  mouthwash, and toothpaste.
[1:02:00.320 --> 1:02:04.760]  And if you don't know what activated charcoal does, ladies and gentlemen, it naturally,
[1:02:04.760 --> 1:02:10.800]  in a clean way, strips away the toxins, the impurities, the plaque, and it doesn't damage
[1:02:10.800 --> 1:02:11.800]  the enamel.
[1:02:11.800 --> 1:02:12.800]  That's really important.

[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:43.240]  Over a year ago, I tried charcoal toothpaste with a major brand, and thought it was amazing.
[1:02:43.240 --> 1:02:45.880]  And I went to my dad, and people said, I would like to put out a charcoal toothpaste.
[1:02:45.880 --> 1:02:47.680]  It doesn't have all this silica and all these fillers.
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:49.360]  It's a very strong toothpaste.
[1:02:49.360 --> 1:02:50.880]  You've never used anything like it.
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:03:18.880]  Here's InfoWareStore.com right now.
[1:03:18.880 --> 1:03:20.040]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:26.240]  We're into hour number two on this July 29th, Wednesday, global transmission, 96 days out
[1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:28.240]  of the election.
[1:03:28.240 --> 1:03:29.640]  Okay.
[1:03:29.640 --> 1:03:37.800]  We have a rival, globalist, corporate, chai-com, EU, Hollywood game that sees America as an
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:42.560]  open-week civilization that they've taught us to hate ourselves and they've got us into
[1:03:42.560 --> 1:03:43.560]  debt.
[1:03:43.560 --> 1:03:45.480]  And they think, now's the time to make their move.
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:50.800]  Well, they thought their move was in 2016 with Hillary, and then that didn't go the
[1:03:50.800 --> 1:03:57.360]  way they thought it would, because there wasn't resistance to them until they actually sank
[1:03:57.360 --> 1:03:58.360]  their teeth into us.
[1:03:58.360 --> 1:04:03.000]  And they'd always thought that we were going along with them because we were scared and
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:04.000]  intimidated.
[1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:09.720]  We were actually just decadent and sleeping in the Odin's sleep.
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:16.720]  But as soon as they sank their crocodile teeth into our legs, the crocodile found that we
[1:04:16.720 --> 1:04:24.920]  grabbed it by the tail and started whipping its head into the ground.
[1:04:24.920 --> 1:04:34.200]  But the stinky hole that is Satan's womb always produces more crocodiles, doesn't it?
[1:04:34.200 --> 1:04:41.360]  So we may have beat the brains out of a few, but there's always more that come waddling
[1:04:41.360 --> 1:04:48.000]  down the path that has to be dealt with, because the universe is full of a lot of stuff, not
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  just good things.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:54.280]  But the bad is there to test us so we understand God's plan, and so we got some crocodiles
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:05:04.680]  to kill, politically, in a loving way, not a violent way.
[1:05:04.680 --> 1:05:10.760]  So we have these shows that are in the middle of the zeitgeist, and this is the most insane
[1:05:10.760 --> 1:05:11.760]  ever.
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:23.720]  And again, it's not a form of choking, it's a form of being overwhelmed.
[1:05:23.720 --> 1:05:33.000]  I mean, in front of me, I have five different megastories that each one, if someone could
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:42.760]  grasp it, would give them the keys to understanding all the other stories.
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:50.000]  Because within a lie is the truth.
[1:05:50.000 --> 1:05:54.120]  If you know the enemy's lie, and you know what they're scared of, and you know where
[1:05:54.120 --> 1:05:59.280]  they're trying to steer you, then you know which way you should really go.
[1:05:59.280 --> 1:06:03.840]  Like the North Star, the North Star for pilots going back thousands of years ago on ships
[1:06:03.840 --> 1:06:11.720]  and cross-country hunts, enomatic groups, because it's always there at that same fixed spot,
[1:06:11.720 --> 1:06:24.200]  and you can then set your trajectory according to that, but see deception, like a comet leaves
[1:06:24.200 --> 1:06:29.960]  a tail, a tail.
[1:06:29.960 --> 1:06:35.560]  And so everything they attack, we know is good.
[1:06:35.560 --> 1:06:39.400]  Everything they push on us, we know is bad.
[1:06:39.400 --> 1:06:45.640]  And so for someone that is awake, and who's decided to actually open themselves up to
[1:06:45.640 --> 1:06:52.440]  the universe, all of it is code, like Neo in the Matrix, he can see the code, other people
[1:06:52.440 --> 1:06:57.600]  can't see the code, they're slaves to the code.
[1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:08.520]  And there are some that see some of the code, but they decide to use the code to enslave
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:15.160]  others and pretend they are the grand architect of the Matrix or the false paradigm, Satan
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:24.440]  pretending to be God, like a little three-year-old pretending he's the bulldozer driver, or he's
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:30.640]  the superhero, or he's the space captain.
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:42.560]  They're pretending, they're larping, they didn't do the work for a hundred generations.
[1:07:42.560 --> 1:07:46.000]  They didn't patiently wait and prepare.
[1:07:46.000 --> 1:07:52.080]  They just think they'll be given the keys to the universe because they can dominate and
[1:07:52.080 --> 1:08:07.160]  dumb down their fellow humans when that is their death certificate.
[1:08:07.160 --> 1:08:11.560]  You take people that aren't informed and you use that against them, that is God's number
[1:08:11.560 --> 1:08:16.760]  one rule that you don't break.
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:21.760]  Imagine if somebody took a Down syndrome five-year-old and laughed at him and beat him up and tripped
[1:08:21.760 --> 1:08:26.920]  him and pushed him into the water and said, look, you're stupid, that would make you mad
[1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:30.760]  because you're made by God, that pisses you off.
[1:08:30.760 --> 1:08:35.760]  But on Dutch TV, they have Down syndrome people on there and they tell them, you're worthless
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:41.880]  and you're crap and they cry on TV and all these people laugh at them.
[1:08:41.880 --> 1:08:56.720]  That is a satanic ritual.
[1:08:56.720 --> 1:09:02.440]  We're entering the zeitgeist right now, the next 96 days and beyond.
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:08.720]  The next 96 days is just marching towards that gate, that door.
[1:09:08.720 --> 1:09:13.000]  I want you to know this, all the attempts to suppress you and to suppress us and to
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:17.880]  do this is because the enemy knows we are transcending right now.
[1:09:17.880 --> 1:09:25.040]  This is the beginning of us taking the stairway towards the next level of interfacing with
[1:09:25.040 --> 1:09:27.520]  the Creator.
[1:09:27.520 --> 1:09:32.240]  Everything they've done trying to suppress that and to try to manipulate that is going
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:35.160]  to fail and they're going to lose control.
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:40.560]  Take heart when you see incredible tyranny and forced inoculations and riots and death
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:48.320]  because it's all symbols of the evil ones losing power and trying to make us bow down
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:51.720]  to them.
[1:09:51.720 --> 1:10:01.320]  So I brought these beautiful, crafted articles of precision made by us who are made the image
[1:10:01.320 --> 1:10:10.920]  of God, a symbol of our will, a woman and a man having a child loving each other is a
[1:10:10.920 --> 1:10:17.120]  trillion times better than these guns because the enemy worships machines and their little
[1:10:17.120 --> 1:10:23.480]  technological terrors to quote Darth Vader, we show you these.
[1:10:23.480 --> 1:10:26.000]  Now could you use one of these?
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:30.520]  No, not if you don't know how to use one.
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:35.120]  But since Antifa is planning their terror attacks nationwide that I'll announce bottom
[1:10:35.120 --> 1:10:36.120]  of the hour.
[1:10:36.120 --> 1:10:40.040]  I'm going to get to it then and because of all this happening I thought I would just
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:53.120]  show them what they hate, the symbol of humanity defending itself and being able to forge devices
[1:10:53.120 --> 1:10:58.960]  to make us be able to overcome enemies that are physically way more powerful than us or
[1:10:58.960 --> 1:11:02.720]  outnumber us.
[1:11:02.720 --> 1:11:08.040]  But it's bigger than that, isn't it?
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:16.680]  It is the symbol of private individuals who have arms that is the true mark of a free
[1:11:16.680 --> 1:11:19.280]  society and a free civilization.
[1:11:19.280 --> 1:11:23.960]  We had a rally with 20 to 40,000 people depending on what numbers you look at in Virginia.
[1:11:23.960 --> 1:11:25.600]  No one had problems.
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:26.720]  There was no crime.
[1:11:26.720 --> 1:11:27.920]  There was nothing that went on.
[1:11:27.920 --> 1:11:30.760]  One leftist started a fight, got arrested.
[1:11:30.760 --> 1:11:39.440]  One arrest and there were 40,000 people armed to the teeth of every race, color and creed,
[1:11:39.440 --> 1:11:43.000]  all humans and that's what scared the enemy.
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:46.480]  And so welcome to America.
[1:11:46.480 --> 1:11:51.000]  Welcome to America where I've got high rated armored vehicles.
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:57.720]  I've got high rated 50 caliber rifles but that's not my real power.
[1:11:57.720 --> 1:12:03.000]  Did you know with my bare hands I can take any weapon I want?
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:11.200]  Because with the will of righteousness, I can break any man's neck I wish but only in
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:18.440]  the service of God because the power in me is greater than he is in the world.
[1:12:18.440 --> 1:12:25.920]  When I wage war to defeat Satan, I cannot be resisted even if I'm destroyed and that's
[1:12:25.920 --> 1:12:27.080]  what they are going to stand.
[1:12:27.080 --> 1:12:29.800]  I don't need these weapons.
[1:12:29.800 --> 1:12:36.280]  I have information, I have the spirit and I can take any weapon I want anytime.
[1:12:36.280 --> 1:12:43.160]  I can seize your nuclear weapons, I can seize your reactors, I can break your neck.
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:49.720]  Know that leftist, you don't have power, you know those of us who love Christ, we have
[1:12:49.720 --> 1:12:52.360]  the power.
[1:12:52.360 --> 1:13:00.000]  Just cracking down on social gatherings says CNN because Fauci says if we don't, we'll
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:06.480]  see further surges in coronavirus positives because they're only ramping up the testing
[1:13:06.480 --> 1:13:13.240]  because the tests have been designed at the Wuhan lab it turns out to be completely fraudulent.
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:19.440]  They cook the whole thing up offshore in a communist dictatorship with Fauci, Bill Gates
[1:13:19.440 --> 1:13:25.880]  and the Chai comms to be directed by the UN as a giant planetary power grab and now it's
[1:13:25.880 --> 1:13:30.920]  all over the news that indeed Bill Gates has developed digital tattoos under your skin
[1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:36.280]  and so has Google and they're deploying them at the airports next year where you'll have
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:40.120]  to have it to be able to travel, oh and then soon to leave your house or go in a grocery
[1:13:40.120 --> 1:13:44.800]  store and the contact tracers work for Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clintons and they're
[1:13:44.800 --> 1:13:47.080]  going to come to your house and make sure you're inoculated.
[1:13:47.080 --> 1:13:51.520]  Yes, we're now inside the mark of the beast, resist or be enslaved.
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:58.880]  There are only a few days left to take advantage of the biggest info war sale of 2020 so far.
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:03.200]  It is Christmas in July and July ends this Friday.
[1:14:03.200 --> 1:14:08.960]  The longest we can run it is a few extra days until Sunday because we are selling out of
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:14.520]  almost all of our best selling products and the supply chain is breaking down with many
[1:14:14.520 --> 1:14:20.360]  of our manufacturers and so a lot of the reorders are held up months.
[1:14:20.360 --> 1:14:26.320]  In many cases this could be the last chance you've got in the year 2020 to get these amazing
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:31.280]  products that empower you and your family's life and health, your immune systems you name
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:39.160]  it, your stamina, your libido, your focus but also you know funds the info war and everything
[1:14:39.160 --> 1:14:42.920]  we're doing to save this republic from the clutches of the globalist and the new world
[1:14:42.920 --> 1:14:43.920]  order.
[1:14:43.920 --> 1:14:48.400]  All of our best selling items, 50% off, store it for shipping, double patriot points, take
[1:14:48.400 --> 1:14:55.040]  advantage of it right now while there's still time.
[1:14:55.040 --> 1:15:15.160]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:25.520]  All right ladies, gentlemen Alex Jones here back live on this Wednesday Worldwide Transmission.
[1:15:25.520 --> 1:15:33.400]  I have a lot of news to cover, a lot of things to get into but I'm not building suspense
[1:15:33.400 --> 1:15:41.640]  here holding up covering this news, I just, I feel like we should have like drum rolls
[1:15:41.640 --> 1:15:48.800]  or spotlights above the office at night to announce stuff like this because that's a
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:53.400]  globalist tactic is that they get so much chatter, so much disinfo, so much stuff going
[1:15:53.400 --> 1:16:05.480]  on that when you actually bring out the huge information it just fizzles out there like
[1:16:05.480 --> 1:16:16.280]  it doesn't matter and again I know from deep research and having incredible sources and
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:23.240]  experiencing it myself exactly what's going on, I mean I know more about this topic than
[1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:29.480]  anybody and I'm not saying that from position of a power trip, I mean I can't tell you the
[1:16:29.480 --> 1:16:38.040]  stuff that's going on, for reasons that you can probably imagine.
[1:16:38.040 --> 1:16:42.720]  I told you years ago they're preparing a malice program to overthrow the United States, people
[1:16:42.720 --> 1:16:48.240]  are like that's ridiculous, now you see it's all over the news.
[1:16:48.240 --> 1:16:54.040]  It's not even Chinese run, it's Chinese backed but it's a malice youth brigade program and
[1:16:54.040 --> 1:17:04.440]  they really plan it and we've confirmed that in DC and Portland and Maryland just everywhere
[1:17:04.440 --> 1:17:12.280]  that they've got explosives and weapons and trucks loaded with ammonium nitrate and just
[1:17:12.280 --> 1:17:17.840]  chlorine gas everything and they're really going to go out and just burn everything down
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:21.200]  and just slaughter people and they're going to try to kill governors, they're going to
[1:17:21.200 --> 1:17:24.720]  try to, they're going to kill police chiefs, they're going to kill talk show hosts and I
[1:17:24.720 --> 1:17:30.280]  mean they're going to people's houses, I mean I told you this, here's the thing I'm always
[1:17:30.280 --> 1:17:34.160]  so far ahead and I'm not bragging about that, we knew they were lasing the targets, we had
[1:17:34.160 --> 1:17:42.920]  surveillance cameras, we confirmed it a year and a half ago and so I stationed military,
[1:17:42.920 --> 1:17:47.400]  retired military at my house for a while because they were thinking about this during
[1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:53.720]  the off term midterm election 2018 and so believe me I'm not going to pay money for
[1:17:53.720 --> 1:17:57.520]  24 hours surveillance at my house and you know guys with guns if it's not for real
[1:17:57.520 --> 1:18:10.880]  reason and now here we are a year and a half later
[1:18:10.880 --> 1:18:16.640]  and the police departments know about this, these Antifa people go to bars and they go
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:20.440]  to events where informants are and they talk about we're going to go to this house, we're
[1:18:20.440 --> 1:18:23.240]  going to murder this judge, we're going to go to this house, we're going to kill this
[1:18:23.240 --> 1:18:26.720]  police chief, we're going to go to this house, we're going to kill this talk show host and
[1:18:26.720 --> 1:18:31.320]  the New York Times puts out where people live and the cops go back and they go let's arrest
[1:18:31.320 --> 1:18:35.800]  this person immediately for conspiracy, for terrorism and they go nope you're not going
[1:18:35.800 --> 1:18:40.960]  to do it.
[1:18:40.960 --> 1:18:45.480]  Now we should think about every angle of this and why they're doing this and not get sucked
[1:18:45.480 --> 1:18:49.720]  in to jump at first because I mean these people are like dog crap who wants to step
[1:18:49.720 --> 1:18:54.440]  on unless we have to, I want to talk about who's ordering this and who's doing this
[1:18:54.440 --> 1:18:59.320]  and the fact that the Pentagon needs to stop being scared of this and needs to join with
[1:18:59.320 --> 1:19:03.600]  America and needs to deal with the people running the operation because I know it's
[1:19:03.600 --> 1:19:08.440]  a romantic you know you want to have the war with the Antifa and you know all this let's
[1:19:08.440 --> 1:19:14.720]  not do that, let's not do it.
[1:19:14.720 --> 1:19:18.240]  I mean I knew we needed an armored vehicle coming up during the election cycle to go
[1:19:18.240 --> 1:19:23.520]  cover events and people like oh you don't need that now you've seen them attack the vehicle.
[1:19:23.520 --> 1:19:31.120]  I want to avoid confrontation, I don't need to put that on my belt that I mean I don't
[1:19:31.120 --> 1:19:37.240]  even want to kill these globalists but if they want to kill us the best thing to do
[1:19:37.240 --> 1:19:42.880]  in a defensive way is kill as many of them as quickly as possible and again the media
[1:19:42.880 --> 1:19:47.600]  will misquote that I don't want to offensively kill anybody but I'm not going to take this
[1:19:47.600 --> 1:19:52.960]  okay and I wish when everybody liked Santa Claus to take down names while we're here
[1:19:52.960 --> 1:19:57.920]  90-something days out and just think about the future if they take down your country
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:02.600]  they destroy your bank account they murdered a bunch of patriot leaders what are you going
[1:20:02.600 --> 1:20:07.440]  to do because you always talked about when the new world order came in and when the
[1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:11.160]  U.N. did this you were going to go out and shoot folks in blue helmets they don't wear
[1:20:11.160 --> 1:20:15.800]  blue helmets they show up in black uniforms and burn down your local courthouse and overthrow
[1:20:15.800 --> 1:20:19.360]  your government run your life and once they get control of your police those officers
[1:20:19.360 --> 1:20:24.360]  of program robots now they'll follow orders to come after you and I don't sycophantically
[1:20:24.360 --> 1:20:29.680]  worship the police I just tell folks don't have a civil war with the cops even if they're
[1:20:29.680 --> 1:20:35.560]  captured and cowards and bad people some of them you have it with the academics and the
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:40.480]  establishment perverts and pedophiles that run it if you're running a war you kill high
[1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:47.400]  value targets and that means the leadership of the new world order and they are gearing
[1:20:47.400 --> 1:20:54.760]  up to do that to us I'm not calling for any violence I'm simply saying we're entering
[1:20:54.760 --> 1:21:01.800]  a new ball game that I tried to stop that you tried to stop and I don't intend to lose
[1:21:01.800 --> 1:21:07.720]  and winning doesn't mean Alex Jones goes into the future I don't say that to act tough as
[1:21:07.720 --> 1:21:12.920]  men we have to decide we're dead already it's easy you'll never be freer to the point you're
[1:21:12.920 --> 1:21:22.960]  ready to die just get over it it's not a big deal but the enemy is not the loser method
[1:21:22.960 --> 1:21:27.760]  playing video games that is told by the media and give it a hundred dollars they're not
[1:21:27.760 --> 1:21:35.480]  the target you do nothing killing them and I don't want you to kill anybody right now
[1:21:35.480 --> 1:21:40.240]  but I want you to understand where they've taken us and what they've done and that every
[1:21:40.240 --> 1:21:45.480]  single globalist new world order operative and an executive level is an enemy combatant
[1:21:45.480 --> 1:21:50.800]  of humanity and once they pull the trigger which they're beginning to we're basically
[1:21:50.800 --> 1:21:54.160]  in it they don't want us to recognize they pull the trigger to the bullet it says we're
[1:21:54.160 --> 1:22:00.040]  based they've already done it but now is not the time you'll know the time you'll know
[1:22:00.040 --> 1:22:07.400]  the time and this is the real world this isn't about games this isn't about protecting yourself
[1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:12.280]  this isn't about this is about who are you as a man who are you as a woman and what I'm
[1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:16.640]  saying here today will send shivers up the spine of the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:23.920]  and back down and that's good and they might move against me this week that's okay too
[1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:31.760]  because there's purity in the universe there's commitment the universe and those of us that
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:37.960]  love God have to stop sitting back and letting other towers dictate our lives and hope some
[1:22:37.960 --> 1:22:47.200]  magic person comes down and fixes it for us no everything we have when you're on your
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:51.640]  motorboat looking at the sky or in a nice house and got a job and got a bank account
[1:22:51.640 --> 1:22:56.000]  that works some man died for that some woman lost her husband for that daddy didn't come
[1:22:56.000 --> 1:23:03.800]  home for that a lot millions died and millions starved and millions were put in prisons
[1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:09.680]  and millions were tortured for human liberty and you stand on their shoulders you will
[1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:20.040]  repay it you will complete the circuit you will and by the way you will find ecstasy
[1:23:20.040 --> 1:23:24.760]  in the moment that you stop being a coward in the moment you stop caring what people
[1:23:24.760 --> 1:23:30.880]  think or what they do you in the moment that you join your ancestors a bridge to the past
[1:23:30.880 --> 1:23:39.280]  the present and just like that to the future and then the doors of perception open God's
[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:44.320]  there the door swing open there's no more fear and now you're with God forever that's
[1:23:44.320 --> 1:23:53.080]  where we are stay with us there are a lot of reasons to get an alex jones plastic mask
[1:23:53.080 --> 1:23:57.120]  at info or store dot com you can wear them out to political events you can trigger it
[1:23:57.120 --> 1:24:02.640]  live darts but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any
[1:24:02.640 --> 1:24:08.480]  costume party or at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks
[1:24:08.480 --> 1:24:12.360]  is absolutely nothing to protect you from covid-19 or anything else it's total virtues
[1:24:12.360 --> 1:24:16.560]  signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations of contact tracing
[1:24:16.560 --> 1:24:21.000]  of their openly announcing it's an active submission it's an act of like putting a
[1:24:21.000 --> 1:24:26.240]  burqa on your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear these is then in the stores
[1:24:26.240 --> 1:24:30.880]  when people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid
[1:24:30.880 --> 1:24:36.480]  cloth mask that you're wearing and the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's
[1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:41.200]  going out so they quote spread covid-19 they don't protect from it so again it's a great
[1:24:41.200 --> 1:24:45.600]  way to throw it back at these control freaks faces you buy one for 995 you get four more
[1:24:45.600 --> 1:24:51.320]  free they're at cost info or store dot com another part of the great awakening is taking
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:57.080]  place is people that haven't even been religious or christian now see how evil is out in the
[1:24:57.080 --> 1:25:02.960]  open how hundreds of churches have been burned in europe and the u.s. hundreds of christian
[1:25:02.960 --> 1:25:07.920]  icons have been burned destroyed jesus has had their heads cut off all over the country
[1:25:07.920 --> 1:25:12.360]  all over the philippines all over europe virgin marys are getting torn down i mean crosses
[1:25:12.360 --> 1:25:17.400]  are being torn down it's absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil
[1:25:17.400 --> 1:25:23.680]  was always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move building beneath
[1:25:23.680 --> 1:25:27.320]  the surface and now it's emerged that's why when i ask listeners and viewers for your

[1:28:39.280 --> 1:28:45.080]  where knowledge comes in it's not the tool it's the knowledge how do you use a hammer
[1:28:45.080 --> 1:28:49.960]  or a jackhammer or how do you use a laser pointer how do you use a rangefinder if you
[1:28:49.960 --> 1:28:56.040]  don't know how to use it all right let me lay out the big news here the mayor of austin
[1:28:56.040 --> 1:28:59.440]  has come out and says let's just ban the second amendment take the guns you know we've got
[1:28:59.440 --> 1:29:05.120]  antifa out running up people's cars pointing guns at them they get shot dead the answers
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:12.360]  is take the guns and you've got the left burning down police stations and burning down buildings
[1:29:12.360 --> 1:29:18.240]  and killing people and shooting people at checkpoints and we're told that's all okay
[1:29:18.240 --> 1:29:21.760]  what's really happening you've got criminals in the federal government we don't control
[1:29:21.760 --> 1:29:25.840]  the federal government it's good and bad we have the blue cities the blue states fully
[1:29:25.840 --> 1:29:33.960]  under chi com control and they're trying to foment civil unrest ahead of the election
[1:29:33.960 --> 1:29:38.720]  in their own words to claim it's trumps fault to remove him from office claiming he's a
[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:44.400]  dictator when they challenge the election results and then if he challenges their fraudulent
[1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:49.960]  challenge they're saying we're going to have the pentagon arrest the president and anybody
[1:29:49.960 --> 1:29:58.720]  that opposes that including members of the cabinet will be arrested and then attorney
[1:29:58.720 --> 1:30:02.840]  general bar who's in the cabinet shows up and they won't let him talk they won't let
[1:30:02.840 --> 1:30:07.400]  him go to the bathroom after five and a half hours they scream at him they're crazy but
[1:30:07.400 --> 1:30:12.960]  don't take their insanity as weakness that's what makes them dangerous so let me give
[1:30:12.960 --> 1:30:18.240]  you the big news I've already seen with my own two eyeballs that God gave me and so have
[1:30:18.240 --> 1:30:27.360]  you and I've listened to the two ears God gave me antifa shoot people and hammer women
[1:30:27.360 --> 1:30:32.280]  in the head and beat people thousands of times that we've seen all over the US the last
[1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:38.280]  five years and we know George Soros funds it through the different organizations he's
[1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:42.760]  on record admitting that we've got all the Bernie people saying we're going to burn down
[1:30:42.760 --> 1:30:46.560]  America Bernie doesn't win we're going to burn down America if Trump doesn't win but
[1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:51.600]  now we have Atlantic Monthly and the New York Times coming out last week saying if Trump
[1:30:51.600 --> 1:31:00.400]  wins we'll burn down America now I mean you know if I started talking about burning down
[1:31:00.400 --> 1:31:05.080]  America I'd get arrested and I should but why are they allowed to do it because they
[1:31:05.080 --> 1:31:12.320]  work for the big banks they work for the establishment this is the man they act like they're rebels
[1:31:12.320 --> 1:31:16.080]  doing all this they're backed by the whole media they're backed by the governors they're
[1:31:16.080 --> 1:31:22.400]  backed by the blue states the cities where they get $500 fines every 15 minutes in Portland
[1:31:22.400 --> 1:31:27.280]  that there's a fence up around the federal courthouse while they're shooting it fire
[1:31:27.280 --> 1:31:34.200]  bombing it with Moloff cocktails and laser-baming people and shooting ball bearings at them
[1:31:34.200 --> 1:31:39.200]  I mean if I show up at a federal courthouse and I pulled out a slingshot with a ball bearing
[1:31:39.200 --> 1:31:43.080]  they'd shoot me it's deadly weapon but oh they don't because they've been told you'll
[1:31:43.080 --> 1:31:53.480]  be indicted so you can see everything I'm about to say right there in front of your
[1:31:53.480 --> 1:32:06.280]  face you can see the revolution being launched by foreign powers the treason the no borders
[1:32:06.280 --> 1:32:13.000]  the no walls the no USA at all and I can show you a stack of internal documents from George
[1:32:13.000 --> 1:32:18.600]  Soros and Alexander Soros trying to pay black people to riot and burn things thousands of
[1:32:18.600 --> 1:32:24.720]  dollars a piece I will show you so they can make the revolution about race war and about
[1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:33.360]  black against white instead of it being about chai calm globalist against America but I
[1:32:33.360 --> 1:32:38.360]  remember when Tucker Carlson a year and a half ago had people come to his house break
[1:32:38.360 --> 1:32:42.520]  down his door threatened to rape and kill his wife I never told people what happened
[1:32:42.520 --> 1:32:49.320]  to us for different reasons and the things that have gone on here or the intel I learned
[1:32:49.320 --> 1:32:59.280]  about what was happening other areas of the country but now I'm gonna lay it out for you
[1:32:59.280 --> 1:33:06.840]  I have it from New York City Washington DC Los Angeles California the CIA federal marshals
[1:33:06.840 --> 1:33:17.160]  the FBI and finally today the APD confirmed what I was told but because I wasn't told
[1:33:17.160 --> 1:33:27.040]  it by people I absolutely knew I did not tell you in the last three weeks that they have
[1:33:27.040 --> 1:33:41.840]  ridiculously named assault teams a teams driving around in SUVs and trucks Antifa with two
[1:33:41.840 --> 1:33:50.720]  and four men's groups preparing anyone that doesn't stop at a checkpoint anyone that including
[1:33:50.720 --> 1:33:59.120]  police will be killed and that's just the surface the media will say that somebody killed
[1:33:59.120 --> 1:34:03.760]  them when they kill somebody else that's what's so scary so we have the whole big tech the
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:09.600]  whole big media we have the we have officially being announced in the city council of Austin
[1:34:09.600 --> 1:34:16.120]  that they're gonna blow up the police department I showed you that last hour officially in the
[1:34:16.120 --> 1:34:21.760]  budget this isn't some recommendation this is from the mayor you know that doesn't make
[1:34:21.760 --> 1:34:31.560]  sense it doesn't make sense this is a takeover it's here and I had the UN running the Strong
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:36.880]  Cities Initiative and I have the United Nations orders US to stop excessive force on peaceful
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:47.320]  Portland protesters in my stack will cover when we come back but bottom line I say this
[1:34:47.320 --> 1:34:51.080]  because it needs to be said it's the truth and I say it for the idiots that are part
[1:34:51.080 --> 1:34:56.120]  of this but they're so low IQ they were never given attention I have their MO I've assessed
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:35:00.320]  them that they are gonna listen but people around them their wives their neighbors should
[1:35:00.320 --> 1:35:08.240]  listen on average it's a kid that was abused usually white heavy drug use methamphetamine
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:14.440]  satanism has a small brain wasn't breastfed grew up in a crib no attention they finally
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:17.800]  get a daddy that's gonna take care of them just like the Mexican and black gangs went
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:21.160]  and got young kids didn't have dads well now the globalists are going to get in the white
[1:35:21.160 --> 1:35:28.480]  kids didn't have dads and they're weaponizing them and giving them methamphetamine and guns
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:31.560]  and telling them go out and attack and they're getting they're killing people they're getting
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:41.200]  killed everywhere but here's the secret they're just the cover for the real hit teams chai
[1:35:41.200 --> 1:35:52.600]  com ms-13 democrat hired and mercenary groups that are preparing to kill certain key senators
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:58.880]  members of congress members the media members of law enforcement and and it's confirmed
[1:35:58.880 --> 1:36:06.080]  they're practicing engaging police shutting down roads attacking the capital attacking
[1:36:06.080 --> 1:36:10.640]  the governor's mansion and and and so the governor so scared he just rolled over and
[1:36:10.640 --> 1:36:15.520]  just said I'm with you I mean you know that's that's you know you think that Abbott would
[1:36:15.520 --> 1:36:21.040]  be good he actually just submitted to it and and so we're gonna I'm gonna read you what
[1:36:21.040 --> 1:36:25.120]  I've been sent and some of the other things I have when we come back but this is it because
[1:36:25.120 --> 1:36:30.440]  the communists just like that guy you know with his eyes all blown out pure pupils out
[1:36:30.440 --> 1:36:33.480]  there they got killed this weekend and also he said they're wimps they're gonna submit
[1:36:33.480 --> 1:36:39.240]  to us of course it didn't happen but that's the whole attitude our our submission has
[1:36:39.240 --> 1:36:44.200]  summoned this and why do the chai comms and globalist care they don't get hurt they're
[1:36:44.200 --> 1:36:52.520]  just doing it because there's no repercussions imagine telling someone just a year ago that
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:36:57.520]  in the middle of 2020 the democrats as well as many republican leaders will be calling
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:05.760]  for the united nations WHO edict that all americans wear masks be a quote federal order
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:13.360]  and mandate totally unconstitutional annihilating states rights think about that a woman can
[1:37:13.360 --> 1:37:20.280]  kill her baby you pay for illegal aliens health care but you've got to wear a mask for a virus
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:26.000]  that killed 20 plus times less than what they said even if you believe the official story
[1:37:26.000 --> 1:37:31.360]  this is about the WHO the globalist testing their power through the media over the federal
[1:37:31.360 --> 1:37:37.360]  government to set policy in the united states this is our punishment for not going with
[1:37:37.360 --> 1:37:41.640]  the carbon taxes and the Paris accord and all of it and by the way they admit that they
[1:37:41.640 --> 1:37:49.800]  say now your carbons down one way or another you stupid americans there are only a few
[1:37:49.800 --> 1:37:57.120]  days left to take advantage of the biggest info war sale of 2020 so far it is christmas
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:04.640]  in july and july ends this friday the longest we can run it is a few extra days until sunday
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:10.280]  because we are selling out of almost all of our best selling products and the supply chain
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:17.560]  is breaking down with many of our manufacturers and so a lot of the reorders are held up months
[1:38:17.560 --> 1:38:23.640]  in many cases this could be the last chance you got in the year 2020 to get these amazing
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:28.600]  products that empower you and your family's life and health your immune systems you name
[1:38:28.600 --> 1:38:36.480]  it your stamina your libido your focus but also you know funds the info war and everything

[1:38:45.720 --> 1:38:52.240]  advantage of it right now while there is still time the people are awakening their taking
[1:38:52.240 --> 1:38:57.200]  control of their own environment cell phones are an amazing tool really they are a super
[1:38:57.200 --> 1:39:02.840]  computer that is handheld but big tech large corporations hackers governments foreign governments
[1:39:02.840 --> 1:39:08.720]  the chai comms especially are using this to steal your data to share your data to be able
[1:39:08.720 --> 1:39:13.120]  to rig markets when they are able to scoop up billions of people's data they can actually
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:19.480]  predict on record what is going to happen in mass movements cutting them out of that data

[1:43:05.800 --> 1:43:13.760]  news here's the big news okay I could sit here and mince words all day but I just saying
[1:43:13.760 --> 1:43:20.640]  nobody cares I've been trying to build a sub for an hour and 49 minutes because we kicked
[1:43:20.640 --> 1:43:28.560]  this broadcast off. Multinational corporations have found and funded an army of mentally ill
[1:43:28.560 --> 1:43:36.880]  drughead, methhead, white people mainly to call themselves Antifa when they are fascist
[1:43:36.880 --> 1:43:40.680]  and to call themselves Black Lives Matter when they work for Planned Parenthood that
[1:43:40.680 --> 1:43:47.080]  wants to kill black people. And they've turned all these little pathetic video game playing
[1:43:47.080 --> 1:43:51.280]  I'm not saying you're bad at those video games, but that's who they are. Losers lose
[1:43:51.280 --> 1:43:56.840]  to go out and do all this. And now they've got them going to people's houses marking
[1:43:56.840 --> 1:44:03.000]  targets and driving the wrong way down roads and yelling at police and the police know
[1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:13.120]  they're not backed by their mayors. So the police are bowing to this behavior which then
[1:44:13.120 --> 1:44:19.240]  only encourages the idiot meth heads to carry out the next part of the operation. And their
[1:44:19.240 --> 1:44:27.400]  orders have come down. Prepare to assault, talk show host, patriot law enforcement, police
[1:44:27.400 --> 1:44:34.640]  chiefs, members of Congress, members of state legislatures, governors that don't roll over.
[1:44:34.640 --> 1:44:39.560]  And they are so empowered getting these orders from Soros and Obama and Hillary, they will
[1:44:39.560 --> 1:44:47.480]  go to federal courthouses and attack federal police armed with weapons with hammers and
[1:44:47.480 --> 1:44:52.840]  hatchets because they believe they're taken over. They believe they have the initiative
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:59.160]  and that's why the great crime of Trump is blocking them burning down the courthouses
[1:44:59.160 --> 1:45:03.880]  or blocking burning down the police stations because they're supposed to as live action
[1:45:03.880 --> 1:45:13.280]  role players as LARPers to go out and say no one's going to oppose us to try to get
[1:45:13.280 --> 1:45:20.360]  all the other hood rats black and white, old and young, all the other meth heads to boil
[1:45:20.360 --> 1:45:28.200]  out of their holes and go out and do this. This is a coward's march, a coward's day, a
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:34.360]  coward's moon because behind them are the MS-13, the CHICOM operatives and others that
[1:45:34.360 --> 1:45:39.320]  are actually going to go out and kill leadership of the liberty movement and then there'll
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:44.000]  be Antifa who's blamed with it. Antifa gets orders via text message, where they go, what
[1:45:44.000 --> 1:45:47.880]  they do, let's come out and documents, I'll show you in a moment. They'll be sent to an
[1:45:47.880 --> 1:45:53.640]  event, they'll be there, house will blow up, they'll kill the ad habitants, Antifa will
[1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:58.760]  think they did it, they'll go off, later they get the blame, whatever, it doesn't matter,
[1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:04.480]  they are the cover. So why did I pull all these firearms out
[1:46:04.480 --> 1:46:10.240]  with TV viewers? To tell listeners, to tell people that are high value targets, you better
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:17.960]  get your guns ready. Yeah, in Oakland they're now burning the county courthouse, but yeah,
[1:46:17.960 --> 1:46:21.880]  that's peaceful. And again, it's the left and the judges
[1:46:21.880 --> 1:46:26.640]  in the left that's empowering this and the judges are ruling for them, saying, burn us
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:35.800]  down, you're good. The cowardly leftist judges, the communist, the judicial activists see
[1:46:35.800 --> 1:46:40.840]  turning on their own quiz links. So I've talked to a lot of sources, but a
[1:46:40.840 --> 1:46:47.360]  lot of this has come out as a reason I'm covering it now. And Antifa all over the country is
[1:46:47.360 --> 1:46:52.240]  preparing massive terror attacks against the American people, killings, mass shootings,
[1:46:52.240 --> 1:46:55.240]  bombings, you name it. And they're on video saying they're going
[1:46:55.240 --> 1:47:02.000]  to do it. And so they just don't want there to be any local or federal response to this
[1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:06.640]  so that once it really hits and once they've gotten all their little minions empowered
[1:47:06.640 --> 1:47:10.320]  believing they're not going to be challenged and believing they're going to win, they can
[1:47:10.320 --> 1:47:16.080]  fully pull the trigger and do this. So we're two minutes to midnight. This
[1:47:16.080 --> 1:47:23.840]  is from my APD source directly from the APD. Just spoke to APD source Monday evening, BLM
[1:47:23.840 --> 1:47:29.320]  and other anti-police group members were riding around downtown Austin in technicals,
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:35.040]  pickup trucks with two, four armed individuals with rivals on the back, stopping cars. You
[1:47:35.040 --> 1:47:41.840]  already have video of this, counterflowing going the wrong way on streets, just exercising
[1:47:41.840 --> 1:47:47.440]  like ISIS does control. APD reported on what was happening and wanted to intervene, but
[1:47:47.440 --> 1:47:54.000]  we're told to stand down unless they started shooting. These trucks were stopping in the
[1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:59.960]  middle of the road, intimidating other motorists, et cetera, rank and fall cops were furious.
[1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:06.680]  They weren't allowed to act. I mean, imagine just lawless vigilante communists. Also, same
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:13.640]  guy who was shot and killed had been at several other protests in front of APD headquarters
[1:48:13.640 --> 1:48:19.000]  with his AK and it stopped vehicles in the roadway on frontage road. APD cops reported
[1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:24.000]  they was doing that again and we're told to stand down. Torches say the activity may
[1:48:24.000 --> 1:48:28.480]  very well have been caught on headquarters cameras, which is scheduled now the city council
[1:48:28.480 --> 1:48:34.880]  to be blown up as a symbol of communist power. Folks, I'm not joking. That's real. They also
[1:48:34.880 --> 1:48:40.360]  received intel briefed at Antifa and related groups were planning for a takeover of part
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:45.640]  of Austin like chopchass in Seattle and then it would happen as early as this weekend.
[1:48:45.640 --> 1:48:49.000]  So they're gonna try to take over in front of the police station this weekend. They're
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:55.160]  calling for additional manpower from APD to be ready, but no word so far, the PD will
[1:48:55.160 --> 1:49:06.320]  be allowed to act and prevent the takeover. Now that's directly from the APD and you watch
[1:49:06.320 --> 1:49:12.520]  it's gonna happen. And I talked to people and we've got the videos coming in. There
[1:49:12.520 --> 1:49:17.920]  are now groups of armed men and trucks driving around aiming guns. Just old ladies you name
[1:49:17.920 --> 1:49:23.480]  it. You know, that's psychotic. That's evil. These people are weak. Yes, but the power
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:30.640]  of the globalist is they have so many evil, weak people working for them. And so here's
[1:49:30.640 --> 1:49:37.320]  the final equation. They're not gonna let America come back. They're not gonna let Trump
[1:49:37.320 --> 1:49:42.560]  be reelected without a physical fight because they've never gotten trouble. And why does
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:49.280]  Nadler or why does Pelosi or why does the Rockefellers or or or or any of these people
[1:49:49.280 --> 1:49:54.400]  care if a bunch of leftists get killed? They never get in trouble. It's big tech. It's
[1:49:54.400 --> 1:50:01.560]  the globalist. It's Obama. It's Hillary behind this. They are the capos. They are the dons.
[1:50:01.560 --> 1:50:09.160]  They are the mafia leaders. They are behind it along with the chicoms. So it's not enough
[1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:18.280]  to cut off the chicoms. We have to as Americans understand that the media says there are no
[1:50:18.280 --> 1:50:23.880]  anti foot doesn't exist. There is no violence because that's a military tactic when you're
[1:50:23.880 --> 1:50:28.520]  being assaulted. Let's come in with the Mars attacks intro, which is a joke on World War
[1:50:28.520 --> 1:50:32.160]  One. The Germans and the and the British and the French would say we're not attacking.
[1:50:32.160 --> 1:50:36.400]  Stand down, turn your weapons because they found a certain percentage when a thousand
[1:50:36.400 --> 1:50:43.120]  troops are running your position, firing at you, you know, machine guns, mortars, howitzers.
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:48.960]  If you go, we are your friends. We are here. The war is over. We've given up a certain
[1:50:48.960 --> 1:50:57.040]  percentage goes, Hey, the war is over. It's a hack. It's a lie. But that's what it is.
[1:50:57.040 --> 1:51:02.240]  And so they're doing this and they know what they're doing. Ever Ever and Childress of
[1:51:02.240 --> 1:51:06.400]  black genocide.com joining us to talk about Planned Parenthood being shut down because
[1:51:06.400 --> 1:51:11.560]  of their Nazi ties, which is good. It shows their own cancel culture finally blows back
[1:51:11.560 --> 1:51:15.760]  on the real people. That's coming up. And I've got so much more on this, but bottom
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:21.360]  line armed communist gangs are now roving and they say anyone that doesn't submit their
[1:51:21.360 --> 1:51:25.560]  checkpoints, including police, will be killed. And when they kill police, they're gonna claim
[1:51:25.560 --> 1:51:30.480]  the police did this. So America is now under terrorist attack. I say we don't negotiate
[1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:36.200]  with terrorists. I say we expand the info war and everyone who's a target prepare defensively
[1:51:36.200 --> 1:51:43.480]  to defend yourselves. Americans have had freedom for so long. And most Americans were born
[1:51:43.480 --> 1:51:48.440]  into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot
[1:51:48.440 --> 1:51:53.680]  for tyranny. We don't appreciate the American way. Truth, justice, due process, the right
[1:51:53.680 --> 1:51:57.560]  to self defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's
[1:51:57.560 --> 1:52:02.200]  how the rest of the world is. Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's
[1:52:02.200 --> 1:52:07.000]  500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try
[1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:11.880]  to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented. And that's
[1:52:11.880 --> 1:52:16.440]  what made our modern world. That's now been hijacked by the technocrats by the globalist
[1:52:16.440 --> 1:52:21.360]  who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumb down and put
[1:52:21.360 --> 1:52:28.080]  into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command even lucky enough to stay alive.
[1:52:28.080 --> 1:52:34.920]  And that's what COVID-19 is a global UN revolution against free humanity against your family,
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:37.760]  against prosperity and against your future. If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve
[1:52:37.760 --> 1:52:40.280]  what you get.
[1:52:40.280 --> 1:52:50.120]  Vicky Gibbs, 57 year old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated
[1:52:50.120 --> 1:52:55.520]  and then died. And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch
[1:52:55.520 --> 1:53:00.640]  it, it'll be innovation. We know what's going to happen. It's a blue city, same story yet
[1:53:00.640 --> 1:53:06.800]  again. And they say her heart gave out. If you put somebody on a breathing tube in COVID-19
[1:53:06.800 --> 1:53:10.640]  as a death sentence, it's on record. Want everyone you know before they go to the hospital
[1:53:10.640 --> 1:53:15.280]  and get killed. Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states? It's
[1:53:15.280 --> 1:53:20.260]  because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs and COVID-19 is causing an
[1:53:20.260 --> 1:53:25.400]  autoimmune response. And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record staying
[1:53:25.400 --> 1:53:31.640]  it will kill you. But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.
[1:53:31.640 --> 1:53:36.480]  And the minute I saw this report today, I knew what I would be reading. Don't end up like
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:43.480]  Vicky Gibbs or everyone.
[1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:47.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:47.840 --> 1:53:51.720]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now. There is no government official here, but
[1:53:51.720 --> 1:54:07.080]  I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:11.640]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people. The press is not the enemy
[1:54:11.640 --> 1:54:37.000]  of the people. The press is not the enemy of the people.
[1:54:37.000 --> 1:54:42.320]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake
[1:54:42.320 --> 1:54:47.480]  news. Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:55:02.000]  we're not the enemy of the people. We're not the enemy of the people. We're not the
[1:55:02.000 --> 1:55:09.000]  enemy of the people. We're not the enemy of the people.
[1:55:09.000 --> 1:55:14.000]  This is CNN.
[1:55:14.000 --> 1:55:21.720]  When you yield back, I would remind Mr. Jordan, Mr. Biggs and Mr. Johnson to stop violating
[1:55:21.720 --> 1:55:26.520]  the rules of the committee, to stop violating the safety of the members of the committee,
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:33.840]  to stop holding themselves out as not caring by refusing to wear their masks.
[1:55:33.840 --> 1:55:36.160]  Is it permissible to drink the sip of coffee?
[1:55:36.160 --> 1:55:37.160]  It is not permissible.
[1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:38.160]  Not to drink.
[1:55:38.160 --> 1:55:39.160]  We can't drink coffee in the room.
[1:55:39.160 --> 1:55:40.160]  I'm getting ready to ask questions now.
[1:55:40.160 --> 1:55:41.160]  Get ready to ask questions.
[1:55:41.160 --> 1:55:42.160]  Mr....
[1:55:42.160 --> 1:55:43.160]  I will.
[1:55:43.160 --> 1:55:45.160]  Mr. Gates is right here.
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:46.160]  No, no, no.
[1:55:46.160 --> 1:55:47.160]  He went.
[1:55:47.160 --> 1:55:49.760]  He went, and that's why I took up my mask, Mr. Chairman.
[1:55:49.760 --> 1:55:50.760]  I'm going to go.
[1:55:50.760 --> 1:55:51.760]  I'm going to go.
[1:55:51.760 --> 1:55:56.760]  So, he tells him, you got to wear your mask all the time.
[1:55:56.760 --> 1:55:57.760]  I'm your boss.
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:00.760]  You got to wear your burqa, your head jib, and you can't go to the bathroom after five
[1:56:00.760 --> 1:56:05.360]  and a half hours.
[1:56:05.360 --> 1:56:08.720]  That is the spirit of these people, and you look at Adler.
[1:56:08.720 --> 1:56:12.680]  Nothing against people's physical form, but he does match who he is.
[1:56:12.680 --> 1:56:16.760]  He's like four and a half feet tall, stumbles around and hardly walk, and this is who rules
[1:56:16.760 --> 1:56:17.760]  us.
[1:56:17.760 --> 1:56:20.400]  Then he's fueled by the blood of dead babies.
[1:56:20.400 --> 1:56:21.400]  They're religion.
[1:56:21.400 --> 1:56:25.160]  The only time I ever saw Chuck E. Schumer get excited was when Trump was about to try
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:26.160]  to ban abortion.
[1:56:26.160 --> 1:56:27.920]  He's like, we will destroy you.
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:29.920]  We will remove you.
[1:56:29.920 --> 1:56:34.040]  They need that blood, ladies and gentlemen, and I'll just say that for the fact.
[1:56:34.040 --> 1:56:39.880]  I was telling these people, and I've been a Christian.
[1:56:39.880 --> 1:56:42.360]  I was born Christian, raised Christian, I accepted Jesus.
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:46.600]  I know the Holy Spirit, but let me tell you, I'm such a strong Christian now.
[1:56:46.600 --> 1:56:48.880]  After I've been through what I've seen, it's 100% real.
[1:56:48.880 --> 1:56:50.280]  It's all real, folks.
[1:56:50.280 --> 1:56:51.560]  It's dead on real.
[1:56:51.560 --> 1:56:55.880]  You think God will give us free will, his children, and then not give us a cheat sheet
[1:56:55.880 --> 1:56:59.800]  and tell us, hey, you got free will, but here's the script.
[1:56:59.800 --> 1:57:02.320]  You don't want to follow this bad dude.
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:03.320]  Please don't do it.
[1:57:03.320 --> 1:57:08.840]  But you know, despite the fact we've been given the whole blueprint, we just crap all
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:10.920]  over what God gave us.
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:15.200]  And now we're getting judged in the hedge of protections being lifted, and I know Reverend
[1:57:15.200 --> 1:57:17.280]  Childers I really respect and love.
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:18.400]  He thinks Trump's going to win.
[1:57:18.400 --> 1:57:21.680]  I just, I'm really worried about election fraud and the way they keep saying, we're
[1:57:21.680 --> 1:57:26.480]  going to challenge the election, but if he challenges it, he's a dictator, we're going
[1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:27.760]  to overthrow him.
[1:57:27.760 --> 1:57:31.440]  And then all these violent mobs and Antifa we've confirmed is driving around all over
[1:57:31.440 --> 1:57:34.320]  the country, preparing to attack people's houses with guns.
[1:57:34.320 --> 1:57:35.320]  I mean, that's terrorism.
[1:57:35.320 --> 1:57:39.760]  But when they come to your house, they're already, here's the thing, bars up there.
[1:57:39.760 --> 1:57:44.440]  And I've got like eight videos this last weekend of them shooting people at checkpoints, Antifa
[1:57:44.440 --> 1:57:47.800]  and BOM, and it's not even in the Senate hearing.
[1:57:47.800 --> 1:57:51.800]  They're killing people and it's not even on the news.
[1:57:51.800 --> 1:57:59.400]  So it's so politically correct now that they're calling terrorism, activism, and protesting.
[1:57:59.400 --> 1:58:01.320]  Which again, when they're done, they're going to ban all of them.
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:02.320]  They take over.
[1:58:02.320 --> 1:58:03.560]  The Democrats are censoring everybody.
[1:58:03.560 --> 1:58:09.840]  They ban rallies of conservatives and nationalists and pro livers in their towns, Christians.
[1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:14.560]  So they're just classic authoritarians telling us that they're the good guys.
[1:58:14.560 --> 1:58:18.160]  I just read to you from the APD, where they've got groups rolling around, driving up the
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:22.880]  wrong street, menacing police with guns, none of them are black, by the way.
[1:58:22.880 --> 1:58:25.680]  They're all weirdo, white people.
[1:58:25.680 --> 1:58:29.120]  And this is their communist takeover, and we're just supposed to sit here and put up with
[1:58:29.120 --> 1:58:30.120]  it.
[1:58:30.120 --> 1:58:32.280]  But good things are happening.
[1:58:32.280 --> 1:58:37.000]  In New York, another area is Planned Parenthood is going, actually, Margaret Singer is a Nazi.
[1:58:37.000 --> 1:58:38.800]  We're taking her name off our movement.
[1:58:38.800 --> 1:58:47.880]  We'll talk about it when we come back with Reverend Childress of BlackGenocide.com.
[1:58:47.880 --> 1:58:55.240]  There are only a few days left to take advantage of the biggest info war sale of 2020 so far.
[1:58:55.240 --> 1:58:59.560]  It is Christmas in July and July ends this Friday.
[1:58:59.560 --> 1:59:05.320]  The longest we can run it is a few extra days until Sunday, because we are selling out of
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:10.840]  almost all of our best selling products, and the supply chain is breaking down with many
[1:59:10.840 --> 1:59:16.680]  of our manufacturers, and so a lot of the reorders are held up months.
[1:59:16.680 --> 1:59:22.640]  In many cases, this could be the last chance you've got in the year 2020 to get these amazing
[1:59:22.640 --> 1:59:27.400]  products that empower you and your family's life and health, your immune systems, you
[1:59:27.400 --> 1:59:35.000]  name it, your stamina, your libido, your focus, but also, you know, funds the info war and
[1:59:35.000 --> 1:59:38.880]  everything we're doing to save this republic from the clutches of the globalist in the
[1:59:38.880 --> 1:59:39.880]  new world order.
[1:59:39.880 --> 1:59:44.720]  All of our best selling items, 50% off, stored for shipping, double page reappoints, take
[1:59:44.720 --> 2:00:12.000]  advantage of it right now while there's still time.
[2:00:12.000 --> 2:00:20.520]  Welcome back, Reverend, Leonard Childress of blackgenocide.org, I was saying.com, I'll
[2:00:20.520 --> 2:00:21.520]  pop my head.
[2:00:21.520 --> 2:00:27.200]  This is the site of the time, blackgenocide.org joins us right now, because some good news
[2:00:27.200 --> 2:00:30.400]  happened about a week ago, and I wanted to get him on.
[2:00:30.400 --> 2:00:34.320]  In New York, one of the main Planned Parenthoods, where Planned Parenthood was founded by Margaret
[2:00:34.320 --> 2:00:40.720]  Sanger, who actually was an advisor to Hitler, Hitler gave her awards saying, you help create
[2:00:40.720 --> 2:00:44.600]  me, you help chart my course.
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:49.960]  They said, oh, in this cancel culture, we're going to pull down abolitionist black leaders
[2:00:49.960 --> 2:00:51.400]  and all the rest of it.
[2:00:51.400 --> 2:00:55.080]  Maybe we shouldn't have Margaret Sanger on the name of our building.
[2:00:55.080 --> 2:00:59.720]  I went to Margaret Sanger kindergarten in Dallas.
[2:00:59.720 --> 2:01:03.240]  I mean, Margaret Sanger was pre-Hitler, she helped create Hitler.
[2:01:03.240 --> 2:01:07.840]  Reverend Childress has made films on this, he's written about it at blackgenocide.org.
[2:01:07.840 --> 2:01:14.320]  I wanted to get him on to talk about how big this is, because they constantly attack the
[2:01:14.320 --> 2:01:16.840]  American flag, they attack and say it's bad.
[2:01:16.840 --> 2:01:22.360]  But then the left itself is the Democrats, KKK, Margaret Sanger.
[2:01:22.360 --> 2:01:27.280]  So finally, though, in that cancel culture, some of the reality seems to be setting in.
[2:01:27.280 --> 2:01:28.280]  What do you make of this?
[2:01:28.280 --> 2:01:29.280]  Thanks for joining us.
[2:01:29.280 --> 2:01:32.920]  Oh, thank you so much, so much for having me.
[2:01:32.920 --> 2:01:41.160]  My birthday is next month, but the gift came very early in this announcement by Kevin Setzler,
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:48.040]  who is basically the chairperson of Planned Parenthood in New York.
[2:01:48.040 --> 2:01:56.080]  If you did not know, the employees had already filed a suit a few months ago about racism
[2:01:56.080 --> 2:01:58.080]  from within.
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:05.600]  So Planned Parenthood is imploding right now, the pro-choice African-American women that
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:11.600]  were working for her, or working for Planned Parenthood, basically said the hiring, the
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:18.640]  assignments, and the treatment was very biased, racist, and they all filed a suit.
[2:02:18.640 --> 2:02:23.800]  Now, coupled with what I said would happen four years ago, I have to toot my own horn
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:25.600]  here because I'm extremely happy because that means-
[2:02:25.600 --> 2:02:29.840]  When you went to Congress, you showed your film, you predicted this.
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:36.200]  I said the Black Life Matters, and they're overplaying the race card, but this would
[2:02:36.200 --> 2:02:41.200]  fall back on Planned Parenthood and Margaret Sanger would be exposed.
[2:02:41.200 --> 2:02:50.640]  So we came up with the website All Black Life Matters, and we often have done evangelism
[2:02:50.640 --> 2:02:57.200]  or activism with our signs, Care of the Center for Biographical Reform, we collaborated with
[2:02:57.200 --> 2:03:05.880]  them, and now, due to the pressure, they have admitted that she has done great harm to people
[2:03:05.880 --> 2:03:07.280]  of color.
[2:03:07.280 --> 2:03:10.920]  What this is going to mean is undoubt, and they will not-
[2:03:10.920 --> 2:03:12.120]  By the way, let me just stop you.
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:13.120]  I should have said this up front.
[2:03:13.120 --> 2:03:19.520]  I cannot overstate how seismic and how huge this is, that the minute the dam breaks and
[2:03:19.520 --> 2:03:24.960]  they admit their whole operation is literally beyond Hitler bad, it's over, so lay it out
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:25.960]  for folks.
[2:03:25.960 --> 2:03:28.920]  I mean, you're right, because you've been on the show for 10 years, I've never seen
[2:03:28.920 --> 2:03:29.920]  you look satisfied.
[2:03:29.920 --> 2:03:31.640]  You're usually like me, the underdog.
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:34.960]  You're looking a little satisfied right now, Reverend, and you should be.
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:37.920]  Well, I know what's going to happen now.
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:45.480]  The young people that are so hyperly, definitely afraid of being called racist, are going to
[2:03:45.480 --> 2:03:51.400]  really rethink their attachments to Planned Parenthood, but they're then going to begin
[2:03:51.400 --> 2:03:56.600]  to investigate, get away from the veneer of things and dig down deep.
[2:03:56.600 --> 2:04:02.360]  And when that happens, I'm telling you, there is going to be a massive distancing with our
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:05.480]  young people, you know, worse than you.
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:07.040]  And Kanye's a microcosm.
[2:04:07.040 --> 2:04:11.560]  He watches the show, he listens to you, I know, because I've talked to his people.
[2:04:11.560 --> 2:04:12.560]  He already woke up.
[2:04:12.560 --> 2:04:14.040]  Wait till everybody becomes Kanye.
[2:04:14.040 --> 2:04:19.760]  Well, it's right now, and thank God for Kanye, and I'm praying for him.
[2:04:19.760 --> 2:04:23.880]  He's played a role already, because they can't shake this.
[2:04:23.880 --> 2:04:26.440]  They can't undo what they have said.
[2:04:26.440 --> 2:04:30.960]  So what, and they did it in New York, where they had Margaret Singer Square, where they
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:34.400]  have her name heralded across the city.
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:37.480]  This is all going to come down.
[2:04:37.480 --> 2:04:45.840]  The biggest one I love the most is that I'm challenging Black Lives Matter to disavow
[2:04:45.840 --> 2:04:51.920]  Planned Parenthood and Margaret Singer, because they have collaborated with them, which is
[2:04:51.920 --> 2:04:56.680]  the biggest oxymorocample in our country at this present time.
[2:04:56.680 --> 2:04:58.560]  So they're going to have to answer.
[2:04:58.560 --> 2:05:03.680]  Yeah, Black Lives Matter collaborates with the group that started the Nazis.
[2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:04.680]  Yes.
[2:05:04.680 --> 2:05:05.840]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:05:05.840 --> 2:05:12.560]  But now the Nazis have admitted it, so they can't, they can't back out of this either.
[2:05:12.560 --> 2:05:13.560]  They didn't do their whore.
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:14.560]  They did every single one.
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:15.680]  Let me ask you, how did this happen?
[2:05:15.680 --> 2:05:19.480]  You're saying the Black ladies figuring out they're literally living under Satan's wings.
[2:05:19.480 --> 2:05:23.080]  They woke up, followed suit, and that's when the dominoes fell.
[2:05:23.080 --> 2:05:24.080]  Exactly.
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:29.440]  And once again, my, you know, all things work together for good for them that love God.
[2:05:29.440 --> 2:05:34.480]  And the seventh Psalmist says they dug a ditch and they have fallen into it themselves.
[2:05:34.480 --> 2:05:39.960]  They thought they could run the race card all the way to November and be unscathed and
[2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:46.360]  they would be the arbitrators of fairness through race and we'll make our demands.
[2:05:46.360 --> 2:05:48.680]  But you're proven to be racist.
[2:05:48.680 --> 2:05:56.000]  You're, they tipped over, well, not just racist, genocidal, genocidal, sorry to interrupt.
[2:05:56.000 --> 2:05:57.160]  That's okay.
[2:05:57.160 --> 2:05:58.960]  They tipped over Frederick Douglass.
[2:05:58.960 --> 2:06:00.720]  They tipped over Ulysses Grant.
[2:06:00.720 --> 2:06:07.560]  They tipped over Abraham Lincoln and for every one black, there's seven white.
[2:06:07.560 --> 2:06:11.120]  So this is really, and we got time.
[2:06:11.120 --> 2:06:13.920]  We can really make our case.
[2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:19.200]  Planned Parenthood's admission is a wound they will never get healed, especially in
[2:06:19.200 --> 2:06:20.200]  this.
[2:06:20.200 --> 2:06:22.680]  I want to go back to this because I don't think listeners understand how giant this
[2:06:22.680 --> 2:06:23.680]  victory is.
[2:06:23.680 --> 2:06:24.680]  I totally agree with you.
[2:06:24.680 --> 2:06:27.320]  This is one of the biggest, this is biggest getting Trump elected to have one of the original
[2:06:27.320 --> 2:06:32.200]  Planned Parenthood started in New York, so we disavow her, she's a Nazi, she's evil.
[2:06:32.200 --> 2:06:33.700]  This is seismic.
[2:06:33.700 --> 2:06:36.880]  This is a major breach in their wall.
[2:06:36.880 --> 2:06:38.320]  What do you expect to happen next?
[2:06:38.320 --> 2:06:44.520]  Well, I expect to happen next is really is going to be the hard work is that the their
[2:06:44.520 --> 2:06:51.520]  banking on, you know, right in New York, you had pastors standing with the Blasio and Como,
[2:06:51.520 --> 2:06:54.760]  which is basically idiotic at this point.
[2:06:54.760 --> 2:07:02.760]  But here's my point, every pro-life activists, every pro-life work, all pro-life speakers
[2:07:02.760 --> 2:07:06.480]  have to make this a part of the talking points just as they do.
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:09.480]  We have to walk lockstep like the mainstream media.
[2:07:09.480 --> 2:07:10.480]  I totally agree.
[2:07:10.480 --> 2:07:15.680]  This should be talking point number one, Planned Parenthood admits that they are racist.
[2:07:15.680 --> 2:07:16.680]  Number one.
[2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:23.420]  Now, here's my four right off the bat, Nancy Pelosi and Hillary Clinton give the Margaret
[2:07:23.420 --> 2:07:27.240]  Sanger Award back by their own admission.
[2:07:27.240 --> 2:07:31.720]  She is racist by her own by that, by their own admission.
[2:07:31.720 --> 2:07:35.520]  They recognize that they collaborated with Nazi Germany.
[2:07:35.520 --> 2:07:38.840]  They now said they have done great harm to people of color.
[2:07:38.840 --> 2:07:43.120]  So give back the racist award get must get it back.
[2:07:43.120 --> 2:07:44.120]  Okay.
[2:07:44.120 --> 2:07:50.840]  Two, I want all iconic signs, street signs, whatever down yesterday.
[2:07:50.840 --> 2:07:51.840]  Okay.
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:55.280]  Margaret Sanger Square in New York City, take it down.
[2:07:55.280 --> 2:07:59.840]  The bust of Margaret Sanger, they're hiding on the third floor now in the Smithsonian
[2:07:59.840 --> 2:08:03.040]  Portrait Gallery, take it down.
[2:08:03.040 --> 2:08:05.160]  We want everything down.
[2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:11.480]  And then, and especially with Nancy and Hillary, they stopped giving the Margaret Sanger Award
[2:08:11.480 --> 2:08:16.680]  just because of the notice of her history was beginning to surface.
[2:08:16.680 --> 2:08:19.800]  Truth crushed to earth shall rise again.
[2:08:19.800 --> 2:08:26.600]  They are in big trouble if we pro-lifers keep making this a talking point in issue three
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:32.760]  iconic African American figures such as a Barack Obama can no longer be speaking at
[2:08:32.760 --> 2:08:37.880]  fundraisers for racism or fundraisers for playing exactly the whole group was founded
[2:08:37.880 --> 2:08:40.320]  by the lady that was the top Nazi advisor.
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:41.480]  And this is a domino effect.
[2:08:41.480 --> 2:08:42.480]  I agree with you.
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:45.280]  I mean, this is this is great.
[2:08:45.280 --> 2:08:47.880]  This is this is undebatable.
[2:08:47.880 --> 2:08:48.880]  Okay.
[2:08:48.880 --> 2:08:56.640]  And, and once again, Black Lives Matters has to explain has to explain and after they
[2:08:56.640 --> 2:09:04.240]  basically denounced this, that they had broken off all collaboration with a known racism.
[2:09:04.240 --> 2:09:08.640]  And Black Lives Matters needs to really be examined for who they are.
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:14.840]  This is going to pull the wool back over a lot of things and our young people once again,
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:19.680]  who are so definitely afraid of being called racist, I'm telling you, they are going to
[2:09:19.680 --> 2:09:20.680]  begin to reach.
[2:09:20.680 --> 2:09:21.680]  I totally agree.
[2:09:21.680 --> 2:09:23.200]  And Reverend Children's in the spirit.
[2:09:23.200 --> 2:09:27.240]  I don't just go off information, I always check information, but I knew in the spirit
[2:09:27.240 --> 2:09:30.400]  six years ago, we went and protested a bunch at Planned Parenthoods.
[2:09:30.400 --> 2:09:35.600]  He held up signs saying the KKK, stop killing the Black babies, all Black Lives Matter.
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:38.120]  And now you see it completely coming out.
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:40.200]  You were on during that time was your idea.
[2:09:40.200 --> 2:09:41.200]  This is so beautiful.
[2:09:41.200 --> 2:09:42.200]  What's happening?
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:43.200]  This is huge folks.
[2:09:43.200 --> 2:09:45.200]  Stay with us.
[2:09:45.200 --> 2:09:48.080]  I actually bought this in blocks, UHF frequencies.
[2:09:48.080 --> 2:09:54.160]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:10:01.320]  and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:02.320]  battery.
[2:10:02.320 --> 2:10:08.560]  Now, with the Info Wars privacy pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[2:10:08.560 --> 2:10:09.560]  Excellent.
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:15.200]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[2:10:15.200 --> 2:10:20.080]  And you can too at infowarstore.com.
[2:10:20.080 --> 2:10:27.320]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:30.520]  your every move through your mobile phone.
[2:10:30.520 --> 2:10:35.800]  Now you can have the power to easily cut them off and go dark.

[2:11:48.520 --> 2:11:56.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:56.080 --> 2:12:02.600]  In today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro life rallies and attempt to bully
[2:12:02.600 --> 2:12:04.040]  activists.
[2:12:04.040 --> 2:12:10.520]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshipers, maybe you can
[2:12:10.520 --> 2:12:11.520]  call the 18.
[2:12:11.520 --> 2:12:12.520]  How many did I insult?
[2:12:12.520 --> 2:12:13.520]  I killed my kids.
[2:12:13.520 --> 2:12:14.520]  I killed my kids.
[2:12:14.520 --> 2:12:15.520]  What the f*** is this?
[2:12:15.520 --> 2:12:26.520]  It's a very f***ing male that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[2:12:26.520 --> 2:12:31.680]  Hey, we saw your face, but with your communist hammer and sickle, that's pretty cool, man.
[2:12:31.680 --> 2:12:35.480]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:38.480]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[2:12:38.480 --> 2:12:39.480]  I don't think so.
[2:12:39.480 --> 2:12:40.480]  I don't understand it.
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:41.480]  I f***ing love things.
[2:12:41.480 --> 2:12:42.480]  How do you get your abortions paid for?
[2:12:42.480 --> 2:12:43.480]  I pay for them.
[2:12:43.480 --> 2:12:44.480]  I thought you said three.
[2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:45.480]  Upwards of 50.
[2:12:45.480 --> 2:12:46.480]  Really?
[2:12:46.480 --> 2:12:47.480]  Oh, yeah.
[2:12:47.480 --> 2:12:48.480]  F*** you, you piece of f***ing sh**t.
[2:12:48.480 --> 2:13:05.480]  Bunch of misogynists and mother f***ing, take your male privilege somewhere else.
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:07.480]  I'm being aggressive.
[2:13:07.480 --> 2:13:08.480]  Come on, Lars!
[2:13:08.480 --> 2:13:09.480]  Excuse us!
[2:13:09.480 --> 2:13:10.480]  Wow!
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:11.480]  Watch out!
[2:13:11.480 --> 2:13:24.480]  These are the guys that attack our children.
[2:13:24.480 --> 2:13:29.480]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:33.480]  And now, Satanic altars are erected all over the United States.
[2:13:33.480 --> 2:13:35.480]  Churches are being burned everywhere.
[2:13:35.480 --> 2:13:37.480]  Images of Christ are having the head cut off.
[2:13:37.480 --> 2:13:40.480]  Reverend Childress, I was interrupting you earlier because I'm so excited.
[2:13:40.480 --> 2:13:43.480]  I mean, this is so good, though.
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:48.480]  The main, one of the founding Planned Parenthoods has said, okay, she was a eugenicist, we can't
[2:13:48.480 --> 2:13:49.480]  defend it.
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:54.480]  Tell us what they admitted and the chain reaction coming out of this because this is the facade
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:13:59.480]  coming down, the double down, the Democrats, founders of the KKK, the creators of the
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:03.480]  Kaiser Wilhelm Institute to the Planned Parenthood, the main funders of Hitler.
[2:14:03.480 --> 2:14:04.480]  I mean, this is on record.
[2:14:04.480 --> 2:14:06.480]  The Rockefeller's doing it.
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:08.480]  IBM and the Holocaust.
[2:14:08.480 --> 2:14:10.480]  All of this.
[2:14:10.480 --> 2:14:13.480]  And we're like, always the left are the ones that are the actual Nazis.
[2:14:13.480 --> 2:14:14.480]  What are they doing?
[2:14:14.480 --> 2:14:17.480]  Because they had to pose as the good guys because they were the bad guys.
[2:14:17.480 --> 2:14:18.480]  The facade's falling.
[2:14:18.480 --> 2:14:19.480]  I agree with you.
[2:14:19.480 --> 2:14:25.480]  This is, this is the biggest moment for human life since Roe v. Wade.
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:27.480]  It's bigger than that.
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:30.480]  So, I mean, how big is this?
[2:14:30.480 --> 2:14:35.480]  It gives us irrefutable data and truth and admission.
[2:14:35.480 --> 2:14:40.480]  The admission of guilt, basically, is something that they can't even retract.
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:41.480]  People, you don't understand.
[2:14:41.480 --> 2:14:43.480]  They can't take any of this back.
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:44.480]  Okay.
[2:14:44.480 --> 2:14:46.480]  They can't spin any of this.
[2:14:46.480 --> 2:14:47.480]  This is awesome.
[2:14:47.480 --> 2:14:53.480]  And so, right now, they admitted she was involved in eugenics, that she had did great harm to
[2:14:53.480 --> 2:14:58.480]  people of color, that her views would indeed be considered.
[2:14:58.480 --> 2:15:01.480]  Well, she said her mission was to get rid of black weeds.
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:02.480]  Yes.
[2:15:02.480 --> 2:15:04.480]  Colored people are human weeds.
[2:15:04.480 --> 2:15:06.480]  They need to be exterminated.
[2:15:06.480 --> 2:15:12.480]  And she also basically said she would use the colored minister to basically dupe the
[2:15:12.480 --> 2:15:16.480]  congregations into accepting her ideology.
[2:15:16.480 --> 2:15:20.480]  They were relentless in their strategy.
[2:15:20.480 --> 2:15:21.480]  And I commend her.
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:22.480]  She was a brilliant woman.
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:25.480]  Don't ever forget that, first of all.
[2:15:25.480 --> 2:15:27.480]  But she was brilliantly evil.
[2:15:27.480 --> 2:15:33.480]  And she basically brought in an agenda that eventually did.
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:34.480]  And that's the key.
[2:15:34.480 --> 2:15:36.480]  She didn't just launch what became the Nazis.
[2:15:36.480 --> 2:15:38.480]  She bought off the black leaders.
[2:15:38.480 --> 2:15:39.480]  Yes.
[2:15:39.480 --> 2:15:40.480]  She bought off the black leaders.
[2:15:40.480 --> 2:15:41.480]  She promised them money.
[2:15:41.480 --> 2:15:43.480]  This is my issue with Jesse Jackson.
[2:15:43.480 --> 2:15:49.480]  This is my issue with many of the preachers, W.E. Du Bois.
[2:15:49.480 --> 2:15:55.480]  Many of them, more or less, cow-towed basically for a dollar.
[2:15:55.480 --> 2:16:01.480]  Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, they all basically realized a congressional black caucus.
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:03.480]  This is all about money.
[2:16:03.480 --> 2:16:10.480]  One of the most painful moments for me was to find out that the congressional black caucus
[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:21.480]  actually had a meeting on how to refute and how to basically answer the pro-life agenda
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:24.480]  that was beginning to creep into the black community.
[2:16:24.480 --> 2:16:28.480]  More or less, they knew the facts that we were saying were right.
[2:16:28.480 --> 2:16:34.480]  And that this was going to be the counter way, how to counter our accusations and counter
[2:16:34.480 --> 2:16:35.480]  our words.
[2:16:35.480 --> 2:16:36.480]  Let me ask you this.
[2:16:36.480 --> 2:16:39.480]  Because I'm not saying we're perfect, but people need to know the difference.
[2:16:39.480 --> 2:16:40.480]  You can't be bought.
[2:16:40.480 --> 2:16:41.480]  I can't be bought.
[2:16:41.480 --> 2:16:43.480]  My soul feels bad killing white babies, black babies.
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:44.480]  I don't care.
[2:16:44.480 --> 2:16:45.480]  They're all innocent, made in God's image.
[2:16:45.480 --> 2:16:50.480]  How do they get white people, black people, you name it, to shine on the extermination
[2:16:50.480 --> 2:16:51.480]  of people?
[2:16:51.480 --> 2:16:55.480]  And then they pose and tell us we're all racist so we fight with each other.
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:16:57.480]  That is so sick.
[2:16:57.480 --> 2:17:03.480]  It's sick because we allow a lot of times ego our own pride and to be quite honest,
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:05.480]  our own prejudices to get in the way.
[2:17:05.480 --> 2:17:08.480]  Right now, we have to be very strategic.
[2:17:08.480 --> 2:17:13.480]  There's certain places I can go that my white counterpart cannot go with.
[2:17:13.480 --> 2:17:17.480]  I'll go with least amount of resistance.
[2:17:17.480 --> 2:17:18.480]  So you place me there.
[2:17:18.480 --> 2:17:24.480]  There's other places that my message being articulated, I would not be the best vessel
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:25.480]  for that.
[2:17:25.480 --> 2:17:28.200]  We have to learn how to be smart.
[2:17:28.200 --> 2:17:33.480]  Right now, we've been given the greatest gift since 1973.
[2:17:33.480 --> 2:17:40.480]  Well, I would say, I don't call 1973 a gift, but I call it since that incident.
[2:17:40.480 --> 2:17:42.920]  This is the biggest gift we've been given.
[2:17:42.920 --> 2:17:45.560]  And the Hyde Amendment, of course, it was very important.
[2:17:45.560 --> 2:17:48.080]  But right now, we have to work this.
[2:17:48.080 --> 2:17:49.480]  It is workable.
[2:17:49.480 --> 2:17:51.880]  We have to confront black lives matter.
[2:17:51.880 --> 2:17:53.980]  They are hypocrites without question.
[2:17:53.980 --> 2:17:57.920]  You've seen the video of the black man out in front of the hospital and he goes, okay,
[2:17:57.920 --> 2:17:58.920]  black lives matter.
[2:17:58.920 --> 2:17:59.920]  What about black babies?
[2:17:59.920 --> 2:18:01.080]  They go, oh, no, they don't matter.
[2:18:01.080 --> 2:18:03.280]  They're even programmed to know that.
[2:18:03.280 --> 2:18:10.240]  Well, it's undoubtedly true that they are being paid, which we all have to understand.
[2:18:10.240 --> 2:18:12.200]  People are having meetings on how to reason with them.
[2:18:12.200 --> 2:18:17.120]  You can't reason with paid hitmen, but you can reach the peripheral.
[2:18:17.120 --> 2:18:22.040]  And that's why I'm excited about getting to those students and those schools that they're
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:27.560]  going to, and in order to subvert them, and I want to come and others want to come with
[2:18:27.560 --> 2:18:32.760]  our message, especially these revelations coming from Planned Parenthood.
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:34.920]  I mean, there's no answer to this.
[2:18:34.920 --> 2:18:35.920]  She was racist.
[2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:37.800]  The organization started it racist.
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:39.520]  And we have to all keep writing articles.
[2:18:39.520 --> 2:18:41.320]  Don't let it just come out and go away.
[2:18:41.320 --> 2:18:45.120]  Just say, Margaret Sanger admitted Nazi, you know, you know, Planned Parenthood mixed
[2:18:45.120 --> 2:18:46.120]  their Nazis.
[2:18:46.120 --> 2:18:48.120]  I mean, they admit it now.
[2:18:48.120 --> 2:18:50.000]  We cannot let this go.
[2:18:50.000 --> 2:18:54.840]  We have to hold on to this as long for years to come until they're gone.
[2:18:54.840 --> 2:18:55.840]  All right.
[2:18:55.840 --> 2:19:01.000]  And literally, I'm not for cancel culture, but a group set up to exterminate certain
[2:19:01.000 --> 2:19:03.320]  groups of people needs to be shut down.
[2:19:03.320 --> 2:19:04.480]  That's what you shut down.
[2:19:04.480 --> 2:19:09.080]  They're shutting down all of our freedom, all of our speech, the national anthem, Christianity,
[2:19:09.080 --> 2:19:13.400]  terror burning down churches, but they're not going when they're the actual Nazis.
[2:19:13.400 --> 2:19:16.480]  No, you go, you're gone.
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:18.640]  I'm going to have fun at the state house tomorrow.
[2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:24.640]  There's a rally there for New Jersey to be free or New Jersey's get back to work group.
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:29.040]  But I'm going to have time to speak and I'm going to demand and no more tax dollars go
[2:19:29.040 --> 2:19:33.200]  to this racist organization by the own mention of Planned Parenthood.
[2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:37.600]  I'm going to point out that our governor, Phil Murphy, has been in cahoots with these
[2:19:37.600 --> 2:19:41.520]  races that has been channeling money to these races.
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:48.520]  And this COVID sham right now is just as much as a sham as Planned Parenthood is.
[2:19:48.520 --> 2:19:50.560]  And that we need to get New Jersey's back to work.
[2:19:50.560 --> 2:19:54.360]  And Reverend, I respect you and totally agree with you, but you're not even hardcore enough.
[2:19:54.360 --> 2:19:55.360]  They're genocidist.
[2:19:55.360 --> 2:19:56.360]  They're not.
[2:19:56.360 --> 2:19:57.360]  You got to be a racist.
[2:19:57.360 --> 2:19:58.760]  Be racist.
[2:19:58.760 --> 2:19:59.760]  That's your issue.
[2:19:59.760 --> 2:20:00.760]  They're genocidist.
[2:20:00.760 --> 2:20:05.320]  They literally have killed more brown people than anybody else.
[2:20:05.320 --> 2:20:08.720]  I mean, Hitler didn't kill as many as Planned Parenthood.
[2:20:08.720 --> 2:20:15.320]  Well Bill Gates and Fauci and Planned Parenthood, United Nations population control.
[2:20:15.320 --> 2:20:23.240]  If the tally was ever basically ever drawn up, African Americans in this country as well
[2:20:23.240 --> 2:20:25.000]  as the world would be shocked.
[2:20:25.000 --> 2:20:30.480]  But guess what, Africa and parts of India and Pakistan are more aware of Bill Gates
[2:20:30.480 --> 2:20:31.480]  than America.
[2:20:31.480 --> 2:20:32.480]  No, I agree.
[2:20:32.480 --> 2:20:35.040]  Let's talk about that with Reverend Childers, who's on fire straight ahead.
[2:20:35.040 --> 2:20:37.360]  This is so exciting for humanity right now, folks.
[2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:44.440]  I'm feeling really good right now, feeling good right now.
[2:20:44.440 --> 2:20:53.960]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy and overall wellness.
[2:20:53.960 --> 2:21:01.720]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date, Super Male Vitality, specifically
[2:21:01.720 --> 2:21:08.760]  designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality
[2:21:08.760 --> 2:21:09.760]  in males.
[2:21:09.760 --> 2:21:15.760]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses, and it contains
[2:21:15.760 --> 2:21:20.400]  no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[2:21:20.400 --> 2:21:21.400]  Yes.
[2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:27.960]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology, working together in
[2:21:27.960 --> 2:21:33.120]  perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[2:21:33.120 --> 2:21:34.560]  So what are you waiting for?

[2:21:43.720 --> 2:21:49.120]  I'm really, really proud of the Dr. Jones Naturals, activated charcoal, naturally fluoride-free,
[2:21:49.120 --> 2:21:50.120]  mouthwash and toothpaste.

[2:22:00.640 --> 2:22:01.640]  the enamel.

[2:22:24.600 --> 2:22:28.200]  I believe you're going to like this as much as the other toothpaste, maybe even more.
[2:22:28.200 --> 2:22:33.120]  Over a year ago, I tried charcoal toothpaste from a major brand and thought it was amazing.
[2:22:33.120 --> 2:22:36.040]  I went to my dad and people said, I would like to put on a charcoal toothpaste that doesn't
[2:22:36.040 --> 2:22:39.200]  have all the silica and all these fillers, a very strong toothpaste.
[2:22:39.200 --> 2:22:40.720]  You've never used anything like it.
[2:22:40.720 --> 2:22:43.720]  Get yours at InfoWarStore.com right now.
[2:22:43.720 --> 2:22:49.520]  The BBC is state-run media in the UK and they've come out with a detailed article that's linked
[2:22:49.520 --> 2:22:57.120]  to InfoWars.com saying, you will have to have forced inoculations multiple times a year
[2:22:57.120 --> 2:23:02.120]  to be able to travel, robots will scan you when you land, you will have a digital tattoo
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:06.880]  under your skin to be able to enter the country, but it's going to be so easy and so cool and
[2:23:06.880 --> 2:23:08.160]  so fun.
[2:23:08.160 --> 2:23:12.240]  The Microsoft website now officially has announced the digital tattoo.
[2:23:12.240 --> 2:23:16.040]  We exposed this six months ago, Bill Gates was funding it, and they had hundreds of news
[2:23:16.040 --> 2:23:18.840]  articles attacking us saying it wasn't true.
[2:23:18.840 --> 2:23:20.600]  This is a tactic they use.
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:24.040]  First they announce it, we say it's a bad idea, they say, that's crazy, we didn't do
[2:23:24.040 --> 2:23:25.040]  it.
[2:23:25.040 --> 2:23:28.120]  They introduce the idea to you, then they come back and announce it again thinking you have
[2:23:28.120 --> 2:23:29.120]  no memory.
[2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:31.600]  This is a criminal takeover.
[2:23:31.600 --> 2:23:33.680]  This is the wine in the sand.
[2:23:33.680 --> 2:23:39.280]  We must say no, we must expose the fraud of COVID-19, this entire house of evil is built
[2:23:39.280 --> 2:23:40.280]  on.
[2:23:40.280 --> 2:23:46.720]  I'm Alex Jones, never surrendered a tyranny, InfoWars.com.
[2:23:46.720 --> 2:24:03.000]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:24:03.000 --> 2:24:06.760]  All right, Reverend Shoulders is our guest, I'm going to say something right now, because
[2:24:06.760 --> 2:24:11.560]  the left always goes, oh, white savior, virtue signaler, no, I'm not like you.
[2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:18.000]  I go off my conscience, and I grew up in Dallas, Texas, where quite frankly there were a lot
[2:24:18.000 --> 2:24:19.000]  of racist black people.
[2:24:19.000 --> 2:24:22.200]  I had a lot of black friends as well, but I mean, I got in a lot of fights with black
[2:24:22.200 --> 2:24:25.040]  people, started to fight with me because I was white, and that was kind of the culture
[2:24:25.040 --> 2:24:28.000]  of the way it was, that's fine, I'm tougher because of it.
[2:24:28.000 --> 2:24:32.440]  But I also went to East Texas where you have a ranch, and some of the towns, some towns
[2:24:32.440 --> 2:24:36.120]  be nice, other towns you pull up, got a golden girl in your arm, and a couple of white dudes
[2:24:36.120 --> 2:24:40.080]  walk over just like black gang members, and they start to fight with you because you're
[2:24:40.080 --> 2:24:41.080]  not in their club.
[2:24:41.080 --> 2:24:42.960]  They ended up, they were in the KKK.
[2:24:42.960 --> 2:24:45.040]  Most folks have not had run-ins with the KKK.
[2:24:45.040 --> 2:24:48.560]  I've had at least four run-ins with the KKK, all because I was driving a nice truck, had
[2:24:48.560 --> 2:24:51.360]  a good looking woman on my arm, they didn't like it.
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:54.160]  The black guys never started to fight with me over a woman on my arm, it was always just
[2:24:54.160 --> 2:24:57.720]  like their cousin got in a fight with me, and then I put them in the hospital, so they
[2:24:57.720 --> 2:24:58.720]  put me in the hospital.
[2:24:58.720 --> 2:25:02.440]  I mean, it was not fun in Dallas, but it made me a stronger man.
[2:25:02.440 --> 2:25:05.600]  But that's all gang-related, it's why blacks kill blacks, and they keep killing each other,
[2:25:05.600 --> 2:25:06.600]  or whites do it.
[2:25:06.600 --> 2:25:10.480]  You know, the rednecks kind of quit killing each other, but you see those old Bert Reynolds
[2:25:10.480 --> 2:25:13.960]  movies, you know, in the 70s and the south, all the white guys killing each other, I was
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:15.720]  kind of on the tail end of that.
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:16.720]  That's what goes on.
[2:25:16.720 --> 2:25:17.720]  It doesn't matter.
[2:25:17.720 --> 2:25:22.520]  Children, a black baby, a white baby, a brown baby, those are God's children.
[2:25:22.520 --> 2:25:29.800]  They have the potential of the universe, and there is a globalist operation to go after
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:36.760]  them, and when we accept that, we accept evil, and we say we're all trash.
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:38.600]  So now let's kill old people.
[2:25:38.600 --> 2:25:42.000]  Now let's kill babies after they're born, and so it's very easy.
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:43.400]  So why am I up here with all these guns today?
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:44.600]  I never put guns out here.
[2:25:44.600 --> 2:25:47.720]  That's because Antifa is announcing violence nationwide.
[2:25:47.720 --> 2:25:49.440]  Well, we have this for defense.
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:50.800]  We're not going to offensively do anything.
[2:25:50.800 --> 2:25:54.640]  We want to point out we have power too, not just your new world order.
[2:25:54.640 --> 2:25:59.920]  And so Reverend Childress is here at blackgenocide.org with his films and books and all the material.
[2:25:59.920 --> 2:26:00.920]  You should visit the site.
[2:26:00.920 --> 2:26:08.400]  But looking at this, he cannot overstate, I cannot overstate the house of cards falling.
[2:26:08.400 --> 2:26:11.520]  We all know Planned Parenthood is proto-Nazi.
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:14.320]  We all know it came out of the eugenics.
[2:26:14.320 --> 2:26:19.680]  But imagine their main New York ranch removing her, and the chain reaction now.
[2:26:19.680 --> 2:26:23.600]  That is a huge victory of their facade falling.
[2:26:23.600 --> 2:26:26.640]  I think that's what you're getting at, Reverend Childress.
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:28.160]  That's where we're at.
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:35.080]  Once again, we unquestionably can use this to even black lives matter.
[2:26:35.080 --> 2:26:37.880]  I don't know if I sent this to you, but you see this?
[2:26:37.880 --> 2:26:38.880]  Yes, sir.
[2:26:38.880 --> 2:26:39.880]  We'll put it on the screen.
[2:26:39.880 --> 2:26:40.880]  Yeah.
[2:26:40.880 --> 2:26:43.960]  Now, they got to explain that, okay?
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:46.120]  They have to explain Planned Parenthood.
[2:26:46.120 --> 2:26:47.120]  There you go.
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:48.120]  They have to explain that.
[2:26:48.120 --> 2:26:49.360]  Okay, black lives matter.
[2:26:49.360 --> 2:26:50.360]  What's up with that?
[2:26:50.360 --> 2:26:51.360]  Okay.
[2:26:51.360 --> 2:26:55.160]  And with these revelations, and then once again, people are going to start looking at
[2:26:55.160 --> 2:27:01.780]  the documentaries, My Alpha 21, the others that have been put out basically exposing
[2:27:01.780 --> 2:27:04.960]  Planned Parenthood from A to Z.
[2:27:04.960 --> 2:27:12.120]  This is something, undoubtedly, I pray that we use to the max, and it will back up a lot
[2:27:12.120 --> 2:27:17.640]  of our, I can't wait to get back on the college campuses, because as you know, we make a big
[2:27:17.640 --> 2:27:20.800]  circle of signs to get the students to come over.
[2:27:20.800 --> 2:27:25.400]  And the first thing they're calling us, I remember Antifa, I've been up against Antifa.
[2:27:25.400 --> 2:27:31.400]  I've been up against black lives matters when we come, and they threaten, they are intimidating.
[2:27:31.400 --> 2:27:36.480]  But if you hold your ground and basically share the truth, I had great conversations
[2:27:36.480 --> 2:27:38.880]  with some of the Antifa kids, all right?
[2:27:38.880 --> 2:27:44.160]  They realized, came back to me and told me, they said, I went deeper like you said.
[2:27:44.160 --> 2:27:50.040]  I said, there's some issues here, but see, now you have Planned Parenthood themselves,
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:51.040]  okay?
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:53.000]  Now they have documented it.
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:56.520]  They have basically said, they even said they're going to take down the street signs.
[2:27:56.520 --> 2:28:01.400]  Now I'm going to be there in that area as much as I can to make sure those signs come
[2:28:01.400 --> 2:28:02.400]  down.
[2:28:02.400 --> 2:28:07.720]  Then I can talk to those students of NYU and others around in that area and tell them,
[2:28:07.720 --> 2:28:09.400]  why did this come down?
[2:28:09.400 --> 2:28:13.440]  Simply because of what we've been saying all along, they're targeting people of color.
[2:28:13.440 --> 2:28:20.080]  Her, Kevin, Karen Seitzler, I believe her name was basically said, Margaret Sanger has
[2:28:20.080 --> 2:28:23.720]  done harm to people of color.
[2:28:23.720 --> 2:28:28.440]  And she also said immigrants and something else to try to, but nobody's done more harm.
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:31.560]  I mean, do you think of anybody who's killed more black people than her?
[2:28:31.560 --> 2:28:39.680]  No, I know Bill Gates is trying, but right now, no doubt this is something we can often
[2:28:39.680 --> 2:28:41.200]  all use.
[2:28:41.200 --> 2:28:45.880]  I mean, black people can use this, white people can use this.
[2:28:45.880 --> 2:28:51.160]  We have talking points that are irrefutable and we have demands that should be met because
[2:28:51.160 --> 2:28:54.240]  they're the same demands they have demanded of America.
[2:28:54.240 --> 2:28:55.240]  Absolutely.
[2:28:55.240 --> 2:28:59.920]  They're pulling down signs of Lincoln because he didn't do enough and Frederick Douglass
[2:28:59.920 --> 2:29:00.920]  will.
[2:29:00.920 --> 2:29:03.840]  This woman literally said black people need to be killed.
[2:29:03.840 --> 2:29:10.240]  You know, I say to your audience, Martin Luther King, the greatest social activist of our time,
[2:29:10.240 --> 2:29:16.960]  a prophetic man, he gave his most renowned speech in front of a statue in front of the
[2:29:16.960 --> 2:29:18.240]  Lincoln Memorial.
[2:29:18.240 --> 2:29:21.360]  And that's where he wanted it, okay?
[2:29:21.360 --> 2:29:23.360]  There was no tearing down of statues.
[2:29:23.360 --> 2:29:30.240]  The civil rights was one with Robert Lee, Robert Lee Lee up with Jefferson Davis up with,
[2:29:30.240 --> 2:29:35.720]  with all these insignias of the Confederate, I'm not condoning anything, but there's something
[2:29:35.720 --> 2:29:41.040]  about when you try to sanitize your history that you, well, let's, they want the power
[2:29:41.040 --> 2:29:44.920]  over history to say whatever it is, instead of leaving it up.
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:49.880]  So, so, so you tear down the RA, the Holocaust, did you, you go ahead and try and touch that
[2:29:49.880 --> 2:29:50.880]  Holocaust down there?
[2:29:50.880 --> 2:29:51.880]  Exactly.
[2:29:51.880 --> 2:29:53.880]  Should they tear down Auschwitz?
[2:29:53.880 --> 2:29:54.880]  No.
[2:29:54.880 --> 2:29:55.880]  Right.
[2:29:55.880 --> 2:29:56.880]  Exactly.
[2:29:56.880 --> 2:29:58.520]  These are momentums that we can't go this way again.
[2:29:58.520 --> 2:30:00.320]  We can't go this route again.
[2:30:00.320 --> 2:30:02.120]  And that's the way I've always seen it.
[2:30:02.120 --> 2:30:07.400]  I didn't think they were ever heralding what they had done basically in saying this is
[2:30:07.400 --> 2:30:12.360]  a, this is a route where you couldn't take Robert Lee Lee almost decided to fight for
[2:30:12.360 --> 2:30:13.360]  the North.
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:14.360]  Okay.
[2:30:14.360 --> 2:30:16.360]  He was going to be fighting against his relatives.
[2:30:16.360 --> 2:30:21.880]  So I, I'm saying all this to say, Robert Lee hated the whole thing.
[2:30:21.880 --> 2:30:22.880]  Yes.
[2:30:22.880 --> 2:30:23.880]  Yes.
[2:30:23.880 --> 2:30:27.240]  And so, and you can't even say that tab could have meant you can't even have a discussion.
[2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:28.240]  So okay.
[2:30:28.240 --> 2:30:34.760]  Let me come to you with what had basically just been revealed since you're on that plane.
[2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:38.440]  I want you to talk to Black Lives Matters.
[2:30:38.440 --> 2:30:39.840]  I'll debate them.
[2:30:39.840 --> 2:30:45.840]  And we want right now a public declaration, the disavowalment of Planned Parenthood and
[2:30:45.840 --> 2:30:47.720]  the denouncing of Margaret Sanger.
[2:30:47.720 --> 2:30:49.440]  That will send shockwaves.
[2:30:49.440 --> 2:30:51.480]  The very simple ultimatum.
[2:30:51.480 --> 2:30:58.240]  This is a real bona fide Hitler gave her the highest award that you can get in Germany.
[2:30:58.240 --> 2:31:03.160]  And see, tell the Republicans, tell, tell them, they're saying their total lamps.
[2:31:03.160 --> 2:31:06.520]  Why aren't they going after the Democrat icon?
[2:31:06.520 --> 2:31:11.800]  Right now, you have the Speaker of the House that received the Margaret Sanger Award.
[2:31:11.800 --> 2:31:12.800]  Come on.
[2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:13.800]  Oh, please.
[2:31:13.800 --> 2:31:14.800]  Let's go here.
[2:31:14.800 --> 2:31:15.800]  No, I agree.
[2:31:15.800 --> 2:31:20.640]  Why do you think the Republican leadership is so pathetic?
[2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:22.480]  I don't, you know, that's the personal thing.
[2:31:22.480 --> 2:31:24.600]  I just don't really think they're people of faith.
[2:31:24.600 --> 2:31:25.600]  They're more smoking mirrors.
[2:31:25.600 --> 2:31:29.000]  No, they're a bunch of devil worshiping lawyers.
[2:31:29.000 --> 2:31:35.040]  Malcolm X said basically, you know, Malcolm X had problems with everybody, Dr. King, Republicans
[2:31:35.040 --> 2:31:36.040]  and Democrats.
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:41.520]  But he said this, the Democratic Liberals are the worst out of all of them because they
[2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:47.880]  pretend that you're your friend and they throw you a bone while they can control you and
[2:31:47.880 --> 2:31:48.880]  manipulate you.
[2:31:48.880 --> 2:31:54.200]  So Malcolm, like I said, had problems with everybody, had the most problems with the
[2:31:54.200 --> 2:31:55.800]  Democratic Party.
[2:31:55.800 --> 2:32:01.800]  So we have to really begin to recognize between the suit, we can't forget they've been trying
[2:32:01.800 --> 2:32:06.840]  to squash that suit, but this put this keeps it on the front burner.
[2:32:06.840 --> 2:32:12.720]  Those girls basically had a lawsuit and they're going to win against Planned Parenthood.
[2:32:12.720 --> 2:32:17.080]  So Planned Parenthood is now under the pressure of the climate of race.
[2:32:17.080 --> 2:32:21.200]  They say, what can we do to appear to be reputable?
[2:32:21.200 --> 2:32:26.800]  What can we do to appear that their charter mission is to kill blackwades?
[2:32:26.800 --> 2:32:30.160]  And so they say, okay, we'll strike down Margaret Sanger.
[2:32:30.160 --> 2:32:35.120]  But that, listen, if I was their strategist, I'd have told you, you got this far with it.
[2:32:35.120 --> 2:32:36.120]  You should never do that.
[2:32:36.120 --> 2:32:37.120]  No, I agree.
[2:32:37.120 --> 2:32:38.120]  Because it's so bad.
[2:32:38.120 --> 2:32:41.040]  They're so evil, they were right to hit their facade up.
[2:32:41.040 --> 2:32:45.320]  The fact that that's collapsing because their own members realized that they're bad.
[2:32:45.320 --> 2:32:46.320]  Well, that's good.
[2:32:46.320 --> 2:32:48.600]  Burn the whole thing down.
[2:32:48.600 --> 2:32:52.800]  And it's the people who would be with them and the people who are on the peripheral once
[2:32:52.800 --> 2:32:58.400]  again, many of the students that are ignorant and don't know their history and have been
[2:32:58.400 --> 2:33:02.440]  bamboozled, they are going to get a wake up call.
[2:33:02.440 --> 2:33:03.440]  And I'm glad to be.
[2:33:03.440 --> 2:33:04.440]  Well, I know this.
[2:33:04.440 --> 2:33:09.080]  I got a relationship with God and I would never think about killing babies.
[2:33:09.080 --> 2:33:11.280]  White or black, but we got to protect babies, folks.
[2:33:11.280 --> 2:33:12.280]  We're not with God.
[2:33:12.280 --> 2:33:13.680]  I want to come back briefly and have you finish.
[2:33:13.680 --> 2:33:17.280]  I'm putting you on the spot, Reverend Childers, with a prayer for President Trump in America,
[2:33:17.280 --> 2:33:20.360]  because I know you think Trump's going to win, but I predicted he would win last time
[2:33:20.360 --> 2:33:21.360]  when nobody else did.
[2:33:21.360 --> 2:33:27.520]  I have a bad feeling right now with election fraud and I think if people don't pray and
[2:33:27.520 --> 2:33:29.240]  people don't get involved, I think Trump's going to lose.
[2:33:29.240 --> 2:33:32.640]  I'm going to try to be negative, but I want you to, if you'll do it for us, lead us in
[2:33:32.640 --> 2:33:37.040]  prayer, Reverend Childers, and have a side stay with us in full wars.com tomorrow's news

[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:47.400]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarstore.com.
[2:35:47.400 --> 2:35:51.880]  You can wear them out to political events, you can trigger it at live darts, but one
[2:35:51.880 --> 2:35:59.080]  of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[2:35:59.080 --> 2:36:03.360]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:05.240]  you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[2:36:05.240 --> 2:36:08.920]  It's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared for the force inoculations
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:13.680]  and contact tracing of their openly announcing it's an active submission.
[2:36:13.680 --> 2:36:17.120]  It's an active like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down.
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:20.800]  But a big reason to wear these is then in the stores when people ask you why you're
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:25.800]  wearing a Halloween mask, say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:26.800]  wearing.
[2:36:26.800 --> 2:36:30.640]  And the M95 mask only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[2:36:30.640 --> 2:36:34.240]  So they quote spread COVID-19, they don't protect from it.
[2:36:34.240 --> 2:36:37.200]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[2:36:37.200 --> 2:36:42.920]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free, they're at cost infowarstore.com.
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:47.440]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult, we'll all tell them to wear masks
[2:36:47.440 --> 2:36:48.440]  or they're going to die.
[2:36:48.440 --> 2:36:51.480]  And then we'll release the pressure for a while and then bring it back and squeeze
[2:36:51.480 --> 2:36:55.240]  it harder and release it again and we'll be the virtues signals, we'll be the angels
[2:36:55.240 --> 2:37:00.360]  even though our lord and master, Bill Gates helped find the whole COVID-19 home.
[2:37:00.360 --> 2:37:04.360]  No, don't seduce me.
[2:37:04.360 --> 2:37:08.680]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates's operation.
[2:37:08.680 --> 2:37:14.640]  He carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:19.240]  As you know, for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in
[2:37:19.240 --> 2:37:20.240]  the romance novels.
[2:37:20.240 --> 2:37:27.080]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the billionaire and who else, oh that's right,
[2:37:27.080 --> 2:37:31.120]  there's the surgeon and then there's one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled
[2:37:31.120 --> 2:37:36.160]  over by these psychotic psychopaths and it's so good to know that there are masters and
[2:37:36.160 --> 2:37:39.880]  they're coming to rape us with their inoculations.
[2:37:39.880 --> 2:37:43.160]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[2:37:43.160 --> 2:37:46.720]  Oh yeah.
[2:37:46.720 --> 2:38:02.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:02.080 --> 2:38:07.720]  The plan has always been to have AI censor us all and now hundreds of doctors and nurses
[2:38:07.720 --> 2:38:12.480]  have tried to give speeches, have tried to go out and talk and Facebook, Google, YouTube,
[2:38:12.480 --> 2:38:16.840]  Twitter, they all banned them and now more than 15 doctors got up and it was banned all
[2:38:16.840 --> 2:38:17.840]  over the internet.
[2:38:17.840 --> 2:38:23.520]  So it was false info off of Bill Gates funded study that said Hydroxychloroquine doesn't
[2:38:23.520 --> 2:38:27.720]  help you but even if the doctors were wrong, which it turns out Bill Gates had to withdraw
[2:38:27.720 --> 2:38:33.400]  his study, Hydroxychloroquine, basically it works 100% of the time if it's used early.
[2:38:33.400 --> 2:38:40.560]  We're now censoring all the doctors and the president's tweets because the UN said and
[2:38:40.560 --> 2:38:49.800]  then a day after one of the doctors happens to be a Nigerian American who they're attacking,
[2:38:49.800 --> 2:38:55.880]  she's out there and an antifocum gets in the doctor's face because she dare betray black
[2:38:55.880 --> 2:39:01.840]  people by talking about something that treats COVID-19 here's that video and then the black
[2:39:01.840 --> 2:39:30.160]  man confronting the nurses about the extermination of black people here it is.
[2:39:30.160 --> 2:39:48.240]  The black lives killed by black men matter right yes the black babies killed in the abortions
[2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:54.640]  clinics matter right thought so the black the black officers killed by that bastard
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:40:00.560]  in Minnesota that matters too right okay but the black babies that are killed in the abortion
[2:40:00.560 --> 2:40:07.760]  clinics don't matter do they are medical people do their lives matter does the future of our
[2:40:07.760 --> 2:40:15.880]  black babies matter huh what's up what's up awful quiet now aren't they uh-huh it's okay
[2:40:15.880 --> 2:40:21.920]  if we kill them in the womb right but you have a problem when we you don't seem to really
[2:40:21.920 --> 2:40:27.760]  have a problem we kill them on the streets yes we know they're the same issue if we don't if we
[2:40:27.760 --> 2:40:34.640]  don't respect the lives of our unborn children enough to save them and fight for them our lives
[2:40:34.640 --> 2:40:39.760]  mean nothing once we're born that's right folks i stand it for all babies give me a break i did
[2:40:39.760 --> 2:40:45.440]  the numbers uh professor children's okay a couple thousand black people on average a year get shot
[2:40:45.440 --> 2:40:50.880]  okay that's terrible and usually it's black folks on black folks okay it's wrong you're talking about
[2:40:52.160 --> 2:40:56.720]  millions of black people getting aborted and it's just doesn't even rate our screen
[2:40:56.720 --> 2:41:01.200]  and oh the lady sees a black guy so she gets on her knee but then he says how about black babies
[2:41:01.200 --> 2:41:07.600]  she gets right up she knows doesn't she yes absolutely and i would i'd like to know who
[2:41:07.600 --> 2:41:13.200]  that pastor was because he was spot on there's no question when you confront people with truth
[2:41:13.200 --> 2:41:22.320]  they cannot handle the truth one the most conservative number is 1200 afghan american
[2:41:22.320 --> 2:41:31.360]  children are killed each day each day no discussion 1200 mothers have compromised their
[2:41:31.360 --> 2:41:39.840]  wounds and have become high risk for children later in life no one cancer and cancer and breast
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:46.240]  cancer and psychological disorders 85 percent of them so that's a fact your body doesn't like
[2:41:46.240 --> 2:41:50.240]  you killing your baby folks you have a normal miscarriage no problem but you you kill your
[2:41:50.240 --> 2:41:56.560]  baby what like doubles your breast cancer it it uh it may be more than that in afghan american
[2:41:56.560 --> 2:42:02.960]  women they're talking about three to four times as much chances of contracting cancer the brain
[2:42:02.960 --> 2:42:10.240]  does not recognize an abortion because it is unnatural and by the time it recognizes the
[2:42:10.240 --> 2:42:16.240]  abortion there's already been developing and it shuts down then but those things that were
[2:42:16.240 --> 2:42:21.920]  the nodule the brain's smart it says i better kill this person this is a bad person so we're
[2:42:21.920 --> 2:42:28.560]  we're basically and coming after that nigerian doctor was a mistake she has what it takes
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:34.640]  to refute and she is recognizing the attack and if you did not know she's going to all of her
[2:42:34.640 --> 2:42:42.720]  patients and asking them to do videos she is she is bad she is just totally frustrated and angry
[2:42:42.720 --> 2:42:49.840]  about how she she saved over 300 patients without rossie clark one yeah oh over over 300 she's
[2:42:49.840 --> 2:42:56.480]  basic and this is president trump did the best thing on yesterday i have people coming to me
[2:42:56.480 --> 2:43:03.200]  now saying okay you're right because of the way facebook was trying to take it down where youtube
[2:43:03.200 --> 2:43:07.840]  was trying to take it down and google and this is you know a lot of the things that they're doing
[2:43:07.840 --> 2:43:13.120]  is backfiring right now i wish i could say it was our great strategy all the time but that was great
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:19.600]  that the president did what he did that was a smart move and uh that basically puts for those
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:24.960]  that don't know he tweeted it and they banned his tweet and then blocked his son so now we can't
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:30.880]  hear a press conference from doctors that's beyond the soviet union you said the same thing i said i
[2:43:30.880 --> 2:43:36.800]  said do you realize facebook and these people banned a press conference by the president of the united
[2:43:36.800 --> 2:43:43.440]  states with doctors nothing political just what there's i mean come on it's time to revolt it's
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:47.920]  time to really stand and people say oh this means the new allure is powerful no it means they're weak
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:53.280]  yes it means that they don't have any other game and this is what i'm talking about November 2nd
[2:43:53.280 --> 2:43:58.880]  they are they're running you know and you were absolutely right what happened with uh george
[2:43:58.880 --> 2:44:09.360]  floyd was supposed to happen somewhere around in august for some reason every time we're down
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:16.320]  the end of interview with pastor children's his audio goes out guys fix that audio with him please
[2:44:17.040 --> 2:44:21.040]  hold on hold on your audio just went out pastor children's start over you were saying what happened
[2:44:21.040 --> 2:44:26.080]  with floyd was supposed to happen in august and your audio cut out yeah and that's what you you had
[2:44:26.080 --> 2:44:31.040]  said previously and i was absolutely right but the people who are engaged in this they're going to
[2:44:31.040 --> 2:44:37.120]  burn out by november so there has to be something else they're going to have to do whatever they
[2:44:37.120 --> 2:44:42.960]  were intended to do and i'm going to tell you something they are so desperate the numbers
[2:44:42.960 --> 2:44:47.680]  they know it is a landslide in november it would have to be fraud but they're not going to be able
[2:44:47.680 --> 2:44:53.040]  to do that i don't believe i remember kim clement the prophet that passed away basically said
[2:44:53.040 --> 2:45:00.960]  trump would have two terms and no one even knew trump was even thinking about that yeah but also
[2:45:00.960 --> 2:45:09.760]  just remember unquestionably they may take out a high afghan american somebody that would cause
[2:45:09.760 --> 2:45:14.800]  a just an uproar in our cities no i agree i think they're gonna pull a false flag
[2:45:14.800 --> 2:45:21.280]  job john pole jackson predicted what's going on right now and i thought he was wrong
[2:45:21.840 --> 2:45:25.600]  in my heart i said man how's that going to happen we got a kind of handle on this
[2:45:26.160 --> 2:45:33.680]  he said there was going to be race riots in cities and so he said pray for brock obama
[2:45:34.160 --> 2:45:40.560]  and i and he said pray for the the africa this for his his family he said but there's going to be
[2:45:40.560 --> 2:45:45.840]  something and it's going to be all over the country well we got that but the fact of
[2:45:45.840 --> 2:45:51.520]  matter is it's still not enough because of the of the mantras they took up banned the police
[2:45:52.160 --> 2:45:56.400]  i don't understand what's wrong the republican party and and police commissioners the people
[2:45:56.400 --> 2:46:04.080]  don't want to the police band okay they're listening to these little uh uh fringe uh voices
[2:46:04.080 --> 2:46:08.880]  that basically say they represent everybody no i risked a mouse at tibetan lion in closing
[2:46:08.880 --> 2:46:13.120]  black genocide.org reverend shoulders lead us in prayer in the last two minutes we have left
[2:46:13.120 --> 2:46:17.360]  for america for all the unborn babies for president trump just whatever it's on your heart

[2:48:35.680 --> 2:48:41.440]  or not the globalist controllers do and they constantly write about and talk about how they
[2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:48.480]  want to create a global crisis or a group of crises that force humans to quote evolve in a new
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:53.120]  better way now when you study how they actually want you to evolve you believe in that it is to
[2:48:53.120 --> 2:48:58.320]  stop having children emerged with silicon bodies and a post human future talk about psychotic
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:05.280]  talk about creepy talk about crazy but they need an event like cova 19 to teach a mammal to wear
[2:49:05.280 --> 2:49:10.480]  some covering over its nose over its breathing tubes to set the precedent for the forced
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:17.120]  inoculations for the gmo for the 5g and for all the things that they admit will end our humanity
[2:49:17.120 --> 2:49:23.600]  as we know it that's why this is so evil their whole agenda for cashless society global government
[2:49:23.600 --> 2:49:29.280]  un control getting us all into debt getting rid of local government think about all the fast and
[2:49:29.280 --> 2:49:38.720]  some of the censorship the surveillance we are selling more privacy pockets a day that we were
[2:49:38.720 --> 2:49:44.160]  previously selling in a month because of the clinton foundation running the contact tracing
[2:49:44.160 --> 2:49:48.160]  and admittedly with google and apple tracking all americans on their phones even if you opt
[2:49:48.160 --> 2:49:53.360]  out of it or get rid of the apps people realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:58.480]  selling your data and using it to control your life sharing it with anti fuss sharing it with
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:03.200]  black lives matter sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people
[2:50:03.200 --> 2:50:07.680]  of the general public that's why folks are taking back control their lives with these
[2:50:07.680 --> 2:50:12.880]  little faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:18.160]  towers to ping at every few seconds and track your location this is the only way to have your
[2:50:18.160 --> 2:50:24.080]  privacy and people are taking their privacy back it's very very exciting they're at 1995 a piece

[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:32.160]  and be part of the movement to cut big brother off
[2:50:32.160 --> 2:50:42.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:42.160 --> 2:50:52.160]  i
[2:50:57.360 --> 2:51:01.120]  i think god every millisecond that i'm not with satan
[2:51:02.400 --> 2:51:06.880]  and i don't even expect to squeak my only under i get sent to hell i probably deserve this
[2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:15.760]  but i still know who god ish all right let me before i hit this next segment and then john
[2:51:15.760 --> 2:51:21.840]  rapaport who always does a great job taking over let me just try to give this an analogy of what
[2:51:21.840 --> 2:51:30.640]  we're dealing with here there was a preacher daryl run this once and i'd heard this piece put out
[2:51:30.640 --> 2:51:34.800]  before but he said it really to touch my heart that day in studio after we've been on air for
[2:51:34.800 --> 2:51:38.960]  a couple of hours we should find out where del ronda says he's getting back on the show up in
[2:51:38.960 --> 2:51:44.560]  dallas and he said alex what would you give for your eyesight a billion dollars two billion
[2:51:44.560 --> 2:51:48.160]  dollars and i said no i wouldn't give that my eyesight he said yeah what would you give for
[2:51:48.160 --> 2:51:57.040]  your soul and i said nothing there's no price tag on that not helicopters not women not boats not
[2:51:57.040 --> 2:52:05.760]  money not bling not gold now everybody knows instinctively that's the smart man that's the
[2:52:05.760 --> 2:52:17.440]  default move but imagine people that are born into tyranny and kept in a box like these different
[2:52:17.440 --> 2:52:23.280]  psychologists these torturers have done in the name of psychology the alfred tensi's the skinners
[2:52:23.280 --> 2:52:30.000]  you're born to that dark box you never even know what's out there but you still innately
[2:52:30.000 --> 2:52:36.400]  they found know the universe and don't submit even though you're born into a small cage you're never
[2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:49.920]  allowed to leave except when a pedophile screws you so i sit here and i you know i i i i i i pulled
[2:52:49.920 --> 2:53:00.880]  back from the whole situation and imagine you've got sight and you know what's going on and other
[2:53:00.880 --> 2:53:07.280]  people around you don't have sight and they're told oh they're a conspiracy theorist because they
[2:53:07.280 --> 2:53:15.120]  know things you don't know they teach people to be scared of information oh that's this info i heard
[2:53:15.120 --> 2:53:20.880]  thank god twitter said those doctors at that press conference were putting out this info
[2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:26.560]  they're banned from their speech now even if their information was wrong you have a right to hear it
[2:53:26.560 --> 2:53:33.920]  don't you but it was all totally true and it was a fake study bill gates paid for it was
[2:53:33.920 --> 2:53:40.240]  proven to be a fraud withdrawn that the un used to say we don't get to see it but that's not even
[2:53:40.240 --> 2:53:48.480]  the issue is it how is the united nations in control of not letting us hear what a bunch of medical
[2:53:49.600 --> 2:53:56.240]  doctors have to say in front of the supreme court bullet
[2:54:00.000 --> 2:54:04.480]  because i read literally i scanned over probably 50 articles this morning with the headlines i've
[2:54:04.480 --> 2:54:10.000]  got them right here about how they banned trump and banned his son and they're in trouble and it's
[2:54:10.000 --> 2:54:15.920]  all legitimate well you know they had this info about hydroxychloric when the un says that's not
[2:54:15.920 --> 2:54:22.240]  allowed even if the un was right which they're not since when did i die
[2:54:25.280 --> 2:54:31.920]  and they woke up as god well since we're inside the new world order so even if these doctors were
[2:54:31.920 --> 2:54:40.240]  wrong which they're not they have a right to speech and since when is the un command us you didn't
[2:54:40.240 --> 2:54:48.000]  think the un was going to come with blue helmets no they come in white lab coats as the people
[2:54:48.000 --> 2:54:55.600]  protecting you from the deadly virus 2.5 million a year are going to die doesn't matter it was 20
[2:54:55.600 --> 2:54:58.880]  plus times lower than they said doesn't matter they put the names of people with that of other
[2:54:58.880 --> 2:55:05.200]  things you see it's still let's all be heroes and then you go to the store you go to work you submit
[2:55:05.200 --> 2:55:11.200]  with the mask you go along and then you submit to the inoculation you submit to the tyranny you
[2:55:11.200 --> 2:55:16.720]  submit to it all you submit to the tracking system and that's how society dies it's by you thinking
[2:55:16.720 --> 2:55:23.360]  you're being polite you think you're being compliant and really all you've done has been a slave
[2:55:23.360 --> 2:55:29.360]  you think i like shooting my mouth over where i go no it's a duty and at first i didn't like it but
[2:55:30.240 --> 2:55:34.640]  that's the thing about exercise once i did it a bunch i do like it i do enjoy it
[2:55:34.640 --> 2:55:56.640]  there are only a few days left to take advantage of the biggest info war sale of 2020 so far it is
[2:55:56.640 --> 2:56:02.960]  sunday because we are selling out of almost all of our best selling products and the supply chain
[2:56:02.960 --> 2:56:09.440]  is breaking down with many of our manufacturers and so a lot of the reorders are held up months
[2:56:10.240 --> 2:56:16.800]  in many cases this could be the last chance you've got in the year 2020 to get these amazing products
[2:56:16.800 --> 2:56:22.800]  that empower you and your family's life and health your immune systems you name it your stamina your

[2:56:40.080 --> 2:57:02.000]  time
[2:57:10.720 --> 2:57:22.000]  so
[2:57:32.320 --> 2:57:36.640]  the story of how alex jones helped bring conspiracies into the mainstream
[2:57:36.640 --> 2:57:44.800]  him began on the fringes of america in the 1990s all right austin i uh he was a late night access tv
[2:57:44.800 --> 2:57:51.920]  personality in austin texas an obscure voice meddling outrage they are trying to make you
[2:57:51.920 --> 2:57:58.800]  dysfunctional they are teaching you false thoughts he began okay as sort of an underground phenomenon
[2:57:58.800 --> 2:58:04.640]  society is insane to me so i'm insane to your average dumbbell you know people in austin would
[2:58:04.640 --> 2:58:08.240]  sit home and get high on the middle of the night and watch this crazy guy vent about
[2:58:09.600 --> 2:58:16.720]  crazy stuff hillary clinton is a fascist worker unhinged conspiracy theory rats biological
[2:58:16.720 --> 2:58:24.400]  attacks imminent imminent political stunts rally they took me into custody and we're going to arrest
[2:58:24.400 --> 2:58:29.120]  me for disturbing a public meeting he was on the fringe because they had nothing it used to be that
[2:58:29.120 --> 2:58:34.160]  you would have to be somebody who was deep deep into conspiracy culture to know who alex jones was
[2:58:34.160 --> 2:58:40.720]  you'd have to know things about lizard people or teleportation paths these crazy crazy conspiracy
[2:58:40.720 --> 2:58:45.600]  theories if you're a lunatic alex jones all right let's stop right here i'm gonna go back to the
[2:58:45.600 --> 2:58:53.120]  very start of this i i watched this last night and it made me sick to my stomach because the
[2:58:53.120 --> 2:58:59.280]  level of deception was so incredible the lies were so amazing the trick editing to make me say things
[2:58:59.280 --> 2:59:06.400]  i hadn't said was was just so disgusting but at the same time i'm pleased to have the ford foundation
[2:59:06.400 --> 2:59:12.000]  which is the total new world order anti america group that financed this doing this so i would
[2:59:12.000 --> 2:59:16.560]  expect this to happen and then there's a bunch of judices that make a bunch of lies about us
[2:59:16.560 --> 2:59:21.840]  that are involved in this well but the reason i wanted to play this at least part of it is
[2:59:22.400 --> 2:59:28.240]  i wanted to talk about the reality because they have the minute intro to it where they you know
[2:59:28.240 --> 2:59:32.160]  have the ford foundation funding it in a few clips we'll just play from the very start
[2:59:34.000 --> 2:59:41.520]  and then they get into this idea that i told trump what to do and then the examples they use
[2:59:41.520 --> 2:59:47.840]  aren't even good examples so even that's a lie because they can't tell the truth they go jones
[2:59:47.840 --> 2:59:56.320]  claimed there was an imaginary executive order of barack obama to take guns i was covering an
[2:59:56.320 --> 3:00:02.560]  executive order he said he would sign he signed it trump talked about it that wasn't for me it was
[3:00:02.560 --> 3:00:08.480]  a major news item at the time i told trump get us out of afghanistan and don't pay for chinese
[3:00:08.480 --> 3:00:14.880]  security for our earth minerals a trillion bucks we spent i told trump he should decriminalize marijuana
[3:00:14.880 --> 3:00:20.000]  i told trump to release nonviolent offenders i i told trump he should get rid of fiona hill
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:24.880]  because he was a george soros operative and wrote at the major publication the globalist.com
[3:00:24.880 --> 3:00:32.960]  that's why they wanted me in jail or shut down and trump was talking to me and was talking to
[3:00:32.960 --> 3:00:40.000]  roger stone but all the examples they give in the show have nothing to do with the reality of what
[3:00:40.000 --> 3:00:48.560]  actually happened. And it shows their mindset they then do stuff i'm gonna respond to it later
[3:00:48.560 --> 3:00:54.080]  day i'm looking at with lawyers a lot more it's just truly disgusting how deceptive these people
[3:00:54.080 --> 3:01:02.400]  are and it gives you a bird's eye view into their mindset it's a lot bigger than alex jones but it
[3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:18.000]  is true you need to hear it from front line that info wars big success was believing in america
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:23.440]  and believing that when the globalist announced world government and the collapse of the system
[3:01:24.160 --> 3:01:28.800]  and communism and the attack on the family and all the things that i knew they were planning
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:34.080]  because it was in their own white papers that if we promoted free market renaissance classical
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:42.320]  liberalism not leftist garbage but but but the real deal that people would want america versus
[3:01:42.320 --> 3:01:52.880]  the new world war and so steve bannon and others miller and others were already listeners
[3:01:54.000 --> 3:02:00.400]  bannon was a screenplay writer he didn't have a lot of his own ideas they would tune in and they
[3:02:00.400 --> 3:02:05.200]  would take what i said during the campaign the one shrimp was elected and they would put that into
[3:02:05.200 --> 3:02:10.240]  policy because they found with the public people agreed with it they had leased on the surface
[3:02:10.240 --> 3:02:16.960]  like that trump resonated with it so it was more than that it was seven or eight people in the
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:22.080]  winehouse that had the presence of your speech writers because see there's no speech writer here
[3:02:22.080 --> 3:02:28.800]  i really believe this i know this i i have passion they were taking what i was saying that's why i
[3:02:28.800 --> 3:02:34.640]  could have a website with maybe only a thousand viewers a day it wouldn't matter where i just put
[3:02:34.640 --> 3:02:42.720]  up my views in an hour long talk that would be the talking points i mean i always believe in
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:50.080]  humanity i was always trying to communicate with the public but it but it is the direct
[3:02:50.080 --> 3:02:55.040]  communication with people in the establishment who've never been decompartmentalized that has
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:02:59.200]  the biggest effect because most of these people aren't even evil in the establishment they're
[3:02:59.200 --> 3:03:09.120]  kept in these cloistered controlled paradigms and so the examples they give are sophomoric and
[3:03:09.120 --> 3:03:15.680]  are not accurate but the influence of what we've done is far advanced from that and i didn't cook
[3:03:15.680 --> 3:03:24.240]  this up i'm promoting a pro-human pro-americana populism that i studied and loved i didn't invent
[3:03:24.240 --> 3:03:28.320]  the 57 Chevy i'm telling you about its curves i didn't invent maryl munroe i'm telling you about
[3:03:28.320 --> 3:03:33.920]  her curves i'm just somebody who's here like someone leading you to your seat at a movie theater
[3:03:33.920 --> 3:03:39.600]  so you can sit down and see the show i'm like an usher and i believe like why are we throwing
[3:03:39.600 --> 3:03:47.520]  all this out we should promote this versus them this will win that was my genius not genius that's
[3:03:47.520 --> 3:03:54.800]  just authentic regular behavior i want rotten food i want good food i want good food so here's a few
[3:03:54.800 --> 3:03:58.880]  messages got a break and then john raport takes over but here's here's from the intro
[3:04:01.440 --> 3:04:07.040]  ladies and gentlemen it is 10 39 central standard time 11 39 eastern i'm roger stone
[3:04:08.000 --> 3:04:12.480]  works in four administrations with all the nine campaigns he's here tonight it's a moment of
[3:04:12.480 --> 3:04:19.520]  enormous tension i'm working the phones very aggressively uh working my contacts but i gotta
[3:04:19.520 --> 3:04:27.040]  shake your hand on a strong showing regardless i was in the studio with alex jones and roger
[3:04:27.040 --> 3:04:36.160]  on election day and the metrics were off the charts about how many people were tuning into info
[3:04:36.160 --> 3:04:44.720]  wars numbers that were comparable to the networks alex jones extremist conspiracy theorist had
[3:04:44.720 --> 3:04:51.440]  rallied his audience behind donald trump is saying trump is projected to win as the night
[3:04:52.240 --> 3:04:58.560]  drew on it became clearer and clearer that trump was likely to win it is officially
[3:04:58.560 --> 3:05:05.280]  over pennsylvania has been called they had no idea whatsoever that trump was going to win
[3:05:05.280 --> 3:05:10.160]  you've talked to him he was all of a sudden everybody that's where the bs starts some dudes
[3:05:10.160 --> 3:05:15.680]  here for three hours with stone and he said we told you trump was gonna win we set it on
[3:05:15.680 --> 3:05:23.680]  record again the thing is just oh we had no idea and they go oh jones got freaked out once trump

[3:09:07.200 --> 3:09:18.800]  show and now your host john rapaport okay here we go another Wednesday this is major
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:26.880]  huge i tried to forward this video which just came to me couldn't forward it in some reason
[3:09:27.920 --> 3:09:36.800]  a georgia doctor was sent a communique proposing what's going to happen in schools
[3:09:36.800 --> 3:09:45.760]  when they reopen so the georgia doctor read this thing and it lit him up and he went bananas as
[3:09:45.760 --> 3:09:54.080]  he should have and this doctor has a few balls this georgia doctor i don't know his name so he
[3:09:54.080 --> 3:10:00.880]  just made a video and he's put it out and it's going to go wide and i'm going to tell you what's
[3:10:00.880 --> 3:10:09.120]  in it right now the scenario is the following let's say it's november the schools have opened
[3:10:10.320 --> 3:10:16.320]  they're letting kids into some degree in the classrooms okay we're talking public schools
[3:10:16.320 --> 3:10:27.760]  private schools whatever and at a school where maybe your kids are one day some kids test positive
[3:10:27.760 --> 3:10:35.680]  because they're going to do testing right the kid tests positive on a fake you know one of the
[3:10:35.680 --> 3:10:43.360]  fake diagnostic tests that's geared to spit out false positive they're going to lock down the school
[3:10:45.280 --> 3:10:50.480]  they're going to quarantine the school they're going to test all the kids they're going to say
[3:10:50.480 --> 3:10:55.280]  that some of them are positive they're going to notify the parents and they're going to say
[3:10:55.280 --> 3:11:04.400]  that these kids have to be quarantined that the school has to be quarantined either the school is
[3:11:04.400 --> 3:11:09.520]  going to remain locked down and all the kids are going to have to stay there or the kids are going
[3:11:09.520 --> 3:11:15.600]  to be transported to some other facility where they're going to be quarantined and cut off from
[3:11:15.600 --> 3:11:22.640]  connections to friends and family but by this time let's suppose that the vaccine is available
[3:11:22.640 --> 3:11:30.400]  a covid vaccine so now they're going to say that all the kids have to be vaccinated and the families
[3:11:30.400 --> 3:11:38.400]  of the kids have to be vaccinated if the parents want the kids to be released to come back home
[3:11:38.400 --> 3:11:51.440]  and what do you think most parents are going to say or do if confronted with that horror show
[3:11:52.720 --> 3:12:03.600]  this is not just this is not just some fantasy this can actually happen because look at what
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:12.800]  they're doing they're targeting groups locations control sectors where they know they've got people
[3:12:12.800 --> 3:12:21.120]  in a squeeze play look at what they're doing to the nfl to major league baseball they bring
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:28.080]  in a test for the miami marlins their fake test all these people you know are idiots they don't
[3:12:28.080 --> 3:12:33.040]  understand what's going on and all of a sudden a bunch of players test positive and they have to
[3:12:33.040 --> 3:12:43.760]  cancel the games this is Fauci and his colleagues come controlling sports leagues and teams in
[3:12:43.760 --> 3:12:50.640]  america simple because they've got them isolated they've got them in one place they've got them
[3:12:50.640 --> 3:13:00.000]  targeted it's very simple this is what they want and schools are a major target so they're talking
[3:13:00.000 --> 3:13:04.800]  about well we're going to reopen them at a part-time basis and some kids are going to be there and
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:10.640]  the other half will be at home to learning and online and then we reverse the next week and all
[3:13:10.640 --> 3:13:19.760]  this crap all of this is basically a cover for we've got the schools controlled that's what
[3:13:19.760 --> 3:13:25.600]  they're talking about we've got the schools controlled all we have to do in a given school
[3:13:25.600 --> 3:13:32.080]  is to say i'll say you got a school of five thousand kids two kids tested positive today school is
[3:13:32.080 --> 3:13:40.720]  locked down phone calls go out emails whatever to the parents the school is locked down your kids
[3:13:40.720 --> 3:13:47.520]  are under quarantine they're going to have to be tested in order to be released from school
[3:13:47.520 --> 3:13:56.240]  are you okay with that or not or they just test them either way parents are going to say oh
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:14:01.920]  whatever you have to do the test the kids more turn out to positive on these fake tests the
[3:14:01.920 --> 3:14:09.440]  school is now locked down okay the school is going to be locked down we have guards security
[3:14:09.440 --> 3:14:16.640]  private public cops everybody guarding the school nobody's allowed in or out we're going to be
[3:14:16.640 --> 3:14:25.440]  we're going to be providing uh cots whatever food etc etc for the duration whatever the duration is
[3:14:28.640 --> 3:14:33.600]  state of emergency applies governor mayor decisions apply
[3:14:35.920 --> 3:14:42.960]  nobody can do anything about and if the vaccine is available then this the next step okay everybody
[3:14:42.960 --> 3:14:51.360]  in the school has to be vaccinated we're bringing in crews nobody can get out of quarantine at the
[3:14:51.360 --> 3:14:58.640]  school they're in there for days weeks whatever it is until everybody's vaccinated and until
[3:14:58.640 --> 3:15:04.880]  their families are vaccinated okay you parents those are the conditions on which we release the
[3:15:04.880 --> 3:15:10.720]  kids back to you what do you say what are you going to do this is a scenario everybody wake up
[3:15:10.720 --> 3:15:14.640]  wake up to the scenario this is it
[3:15:17.200 --> 3:15:22.320]  in any group in any situation in any locale this is what they can do
[3:15:24.320 --> 3:15:31.680]  in schools the only answer is homeschooling that's it period and not just a few homeschools but so
[3:15:31.680 --> 3:15:36.560]  many that they don't have the resources to go around and checking on every single one
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:44.640]  and making all kinds of incredible requirements and conditions there's no choice
[3:15:47.120 --> 3:15:54.480]  no choice at all you go you school your kids at home that's it period unless you want to
[3:15:54.480 --> 3:16:01.600]  have them forcibly tested traced vaccinated quarantined isolated out of your control completely
[3:16:01.600 --> 3:16:07.440]  and you don't care as parents then fine then send them to school that's the story
[3:16:10.080 --> 3:16:17.040]  now you may not be in a situation where you can homeschool your kids maybe both of parents work
[3:16:18.240 --> 3:16:25.280]  or well we just don't know how to do it we can't we can't do all right set up a small community
[3:16:25.280 --> 3:16:33.520]  homeschool where you have a very small group of parents and kids and you pick the very best parents
[3:16:34.320 --> 3:16:40.080]  the ones that are the smartest the best with kids you know hopefully the miracle workers
[3:16:40.080 --> 3:16:44.880]  that are going to educate these kids at home that's it period
[3:16:47.680 --> 3:16:50.880]  you know i've been talking about this for god knows how long
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:56.640]  so about homeschool homeschool it's now
[3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:05.520]  beyond a a good idea it's luxury it's beyond okay let's see this is following yeah this is
[3:17:05.520 --> 3:17:13.360]  a solution we're not even talking about that you get it you get what i'm saying here
[3:17:13.360 --> 3:17:23.760]  they've got targeting locations a captive audience schools
[3:17:26.160 --> 3:17:32.480]  do what they want to i've just laid out the scenario better wake up better figure it out
[3:17:32.480 --> 3:17:36.800]  better see it better understand it better take action see how
[3:17:36.800 --> 3:17:43.120]  okay actually bought this it blocks u h f frequencies snowden and others taught us how

[3:19:36.880 --> 3:19:43.200]  the reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one reason is
[3:19:43.200 --> 3:19:50.080]  it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over those purposes many times here on air
[3:19:50.720 --> 3:19:55.200]  the casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced
[3:19:55.200 --> 3:20:01.600]  inoculation but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are
[3:20:01.600 --> 3:20:10.080]  not essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that
[3:20:10.080 --> 3:20:17.280]  people once had by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's
[3:20:17.280 --> 3:20:23.360]  been preplanned organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental
[3:20:23.360 --> 3:20:30.240]  actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to
[3:20:30.240 --> 3:20:37.520]  pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest form of technocracy fascism
[3:20:37.520 --> 3:20:57.200]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:20:57.200 --> 3:21:08.400]  so you see they want to harvest children simple as that they want to destroy them and destroy you
[3:21:08.400 --> 3:21:14.800]  in the process of course destroy your will destroy your liberty your freedom and try to
[3:21:14.800 --> 3:21:21.040]  destroy your soul which they can't do but they can make serious inroads
[3:21:21.040 --> 3:21:28.880]  think about having your child stolen out from under you as school
[3:21:30.960 --> 3:21:37.840]  sorry school's locked down there's nothing we can do we had three kids test positive today it's
[3:21:37.840 --> 3:21:44.480]  the virus uh desperation uh the threat the threat the threat the threat lockdown quarantine
[3:21:44.480 --> 3:21:52.480]  testing for everybody vaccines for everybody school is locked down nobody can get in or
[3:21:52.480 --> 3:21:58.160]  we just took all the kids away from the school and to an undisclosed location where they'll be
[3:21:58.160 --> 3:22:06.480]  protected and safe and germ free etc etc and you can't get them out you parents you can't get them
[3:22:06.480 --> 3:22:14.240]  out you cannot get them out you can't get them out you cannot get them out unless you cooperate
[3:22:14.240 --> 3:22:20.160]  that's called a squeeze play that's called a captive audience wake up understand what they're after
[3:22:23.040 --> 3:22:28.320]  of course everybody gets tested including all the families of all the kids that are at this
[3:22:28.320 --> 3:22:37.840]  undisclosed location and everybody gets vaccinated then we can release the kids and then everybody's
[3:22:37.840 --> 3:22:44.960]  safe so you agree or not because if you say no then kids stay in lockdown
[3:22:47.440 --> 3:22:51.840]  you can't get in they can't get out you can't get in they can't get out what are you going to do
[3:22:51.840 --> 3:23:00.640]  now it's too late now you're screwed now you made the wrong move and now you're going to pay
[3:23:00.640 --> 3:23:07.360]  instead of homeschooling your kids instead of virtually everybody saying to the governors
[3:23:07.360 --> 3:23:12.160]  and the mayors and the presidents and the prime ministers and whoever the hell it is
[3:23:12.160 --> 3:23:16.400]  we're not going to school we're keeping the kids home we're going to homeschool
[3:23:16.400 --> 3:23:22.640]  going to take care of them here where they belong we're going to set up small community schools
[3:23:23.920 --> 3:23:30.160]  homeschools very small many many many many many thousands of them too many of you to trace
[3:23:34.240 --> 3:23:38.960]  that's what we're going to do because we don't want your system we're going to back out we're
[3:23:38.960 --> 3:23:46.320]  going to say bye bye because we know what you do with the captive audience that's what you want
[3:23:47.040 --> 3:23:52.640]  that's what Fauci is looking at all the time who else can we screw up here who else can we
[3:23:52.640 --> 3:24:00.480]  twist it on who else can we destroy what else can we ruin in the name of the fake virus what
[3:24:00.480 --> 3:24:13.520]  else can we do to create you know misery and chaos and destruction that's what they're doing
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:24.800]  so recently i took a look at the cdc definition of a case of covid-19 i'm familiar with this game
[3:24:24.800 --> 3:24:31.360]  i've been in it for 38 years as a reporter i've been around the block thousands of times on
[3:24:31.360 --> 3:24:38.320]  fake epidemics and i saw back in 1987 the cdc case definition for AIDS
[3:24:40.480 --> 3:24:47.200]  they called it a surveillance definition i published the entire definition in my book AIDS Inc
[3:24:47.200 --> 3:24:55.280]  which came out 1988 and the cdc definition of a case of AIDS took 15 pages in the book
[3:24:56.560 --> 3:25:02.480]  15 friggin pages do you know what that means that means that they did everything in their power
[3:25:03.200 --> 3:25:11.680]  to provide a menu of definitions so that virtually anybody could be diagnosed with AIDS
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:17.200]  which is exactly what they did for example they basically said that anybody with a bacterial
[3:25:17.200 --> 3:25:25.200]  infection could be diagnosed as having AIDS period so now i look at the covid-19 definition
[3:25:25.200 --> 3:25:33.840]  revised for a case of covid-19 and what do i see well i see there's five separate separate sets of
[3:25:33.840 --> 3:25:40.800]  criteria this lets you know right away you know the amount of bs that's involved here the amount
[3:25:40.800 --> 3:25:51.120]  of jive the amount of insanity that they are producing in order to define a covid case so that
[3:25:51.120 --> 3:26:00.720]  anybody can be called a covid case okay and for wars me other people all sorts of other people
[3:26:01.440 --> 3:26:08.400]  have been exposing since the beginning of this fake pandemic all manner of ways in which they
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:14.000]  are fraudulently inflating case numbers and death numbers and so on and so forth and this may be the
[3:26:14.000 --> 3:26:26.720]  biggest of all in the very definition of what a covid-19 case is April 2020 they give you five sets
[3:26:26.720 --> 3:26:36.160]  of criteria if a person fits into any one of these sets they can be summarily diagnosed as a covid-19
[3:26:36.160 --> 3:26:47.600]  case and in the first set of criteria they say that for example chills plus fever covid-19
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:26:55.360]  period that's it chills plus fever can be diagnosed as covid-19
[3:26:57.040 --> 3:27:01.920]  oh but you have to have a test no you don't yes you do no you don't oh of course you must
[3:27:01.920 --> 3:27:07.360]  that no you don't but how could they you don't you don't need a test because there's a separate
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:16.560]  set of criteria that involves testing and as i said if you as a person fit into any one of the
[3:27:16.560 --> 3:27:25.600]  five sets then you can be diagnosed as covid-19 you don't have to fit into all the sets here's another
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:35.280]  a cough cough that's it that allows you to be diagnosed as covid-19 a cough
[3:27:37.280 --> 3:27:42.640]  chills or fever chills and fever that's one for example and these are not the only two
[3:27:42.640 --> 3:27:50.480]  believe me in other words just about anybody can be diagnosed if i sit here and i go i could be
[3:27:50.480 --> 3:27:58.320]  diagnosed you at home going you could be diagnosed the man on the friggin moon coughing could be
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:09.040]  diagnosed that's how they're doing it that's what they did in 1987 so that virtually anybody
[3:28:09.040 --> 3:28:14.320]  could be diagnosed with AIDS that's what they're doing now it's the same playbook they just use
[3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:23.040]  it over and over again they recycle it that's what they're doing so when people say well at the hospital
[3:28:23.040 --> 3:28:27.200]  how could they be diagnosing people without even necessarily testing well that's how
[3:28:28.160 --> 3:28:32.480]  they just eyeball it they say well looks like covid-19 okay write it on the file
[3:28:33.680 --> 3:28:40.080]  patient died falling down the stairs but also oh look at this well you know looks like he
[3:28:40.080 --> 3:28:46.880]  had a fever or whatever a covid-19 write it on the death certificate inflates the case numbers
[3:28:46.880 --> 3:28:52.720]  inflates the amount of money in the united states that each state gets from the federal government
[3:28:52.720 --> 3:29:05.840]  went over that last week and it means and this is when it gets real that virtually anybody could
[3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:13.360]  be diagnosed as covid-19 including you including your husband or wife including your kids including
[3:29:13.360 --> 3:29:20.160]  your relatives and your friends including your kids at school well was my kid tested at school
[3:29:20.160 --> 3:29:25.520]  when you said that he has covid-19 that's proprietary information we don't have to report that we just
[3:29:25.520 --> 3:29:30.800]  know that he's been now diagnosed as covid-19 what do you mean it's proprietary it's my kid
[3:29:30.800 --> 3:29:37.200]  sorry this is a medical situation it's an emergency it's a lockdown it's a quarantine you can't
[3:29:37.200 --> 3:29:42.560]  question the state of emergency we're telling you what's going on and we're telling you what
[3:29:42.560 --> 3:29:51.920]  you have to do in order to get your kid out and that's it hmm so why did you send your kid to
[3:29:51.920 --> 3:29:57.520]  school in the first place because you were naive because you had faith because you trusted the wrong
[3:29:57.520 --> 3:30:03.200]  people because you put your trust in the government because you assumed that they must have your best
[3:30:03.200 --> 3:30:08.880]  interest at heart and they want your kid to go to school and babysit the kid all day to give you a
[3:30:08.880 --> 3:30:15.360]  break so that you work and so on but that's neither at all you said something else would be different
[3:30:15.360 --> 3:30:20.640]  and now they can diagnose your kid or anybody else anytime they want to without even doing a test
[3:30:20.640 --> 3:30:28.320]  and just say covid-19 and that's it period no recourse that's what they can do to you
[3:30:30.080 --> 3:30:34.000]  we'll have more on the other side of the break john rapping for the info wars

[3:32:49.280 --> 3:32:53.600]  that haven't experienced living defense to get it for yourself here's just part of one testimonial
[3:32:53.600 --> 3:32:58.960]  i looked in january 2016 i went in a hospital i went to va hospital out here in boise and i was in
[3:32:58.960 --> 3:33:03.920]  there until june and one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to info
[3:33:03.920 --> 3:33:09.120]  wars three hours a day and i kept hearing dr group and all you guys talking about living defense
[3:33:09.120 --> 3:33:13.760]  let me tell you something man i had an internal digestive problem and i suffered with it for
[3:33:13.760 --> 3:33:18.560]  about five or six years and the doctors they tried every test nobody could figure out what it is and
[3:33:18.560 --> 3:33:22.560]  then every day when i kept hearing you and dr group and those commercials i said you know what i'm
[3:33:22.560 --> 3:33:25.760]  gonna get me some of that freaking living defense now i wasn't supposed to have any
[3:33:25.760 --> 3:33:29.520]  nutritional because they don't want you to have a stuff but i ordered it had it shipped to me
[3:33:29.520 --> 3:33:35.280]  i got it i hid it from the nurses i started taking it man that stuff changed my life it saved my life
[3:33:35.280 --> 3:33:41.440]  alex jones and info wars saved my life a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years
[3:33:41.440 --> 3:33:47.200]  and if you go back to those shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell phones
[3:33:47.840 --> 3:33:53.840]  how programmed master computers would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just
[3:33:53.840 --> 3:33:59.040]  predict large groups of human movements and activities but even predict what individuals
[3:33:59.040 --> 3:34:03.120]  would do and then once you could predict what individuals were going to be doing you could
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:09.280]  add stimuli through the ai systems through the computers through digital billboards through
[3:34:09.280 --> 3:34:14.160]  face scanning through the social credit score to control people and make them act like you wanted
[3:34:14.160 --> 3:34:19.680]  to but when we cover that the media would attack us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy
[3:34:19.680 --> 3:34:25.040]  theory even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents well the next level of
[3:34:25.040 --> 3:34:30.000]  the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans
[3:34:30.000 --> 3:34:35.680]  obsolete and phase us out and it's something about a thousand times crazier than what hitler planned
[3:34:35.680 --> 3:34:55.680]  so we might want to dismantle the system now you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:55.680 --> 3:35:08.640]  news analysis reports it's the alex jones show and now your host john wrap up
[3:35:12.400 --> 3:35:20.560]  okay last segment so get the word out here what they're going to do with schools
[3:35:20.560 --> 3:35:28.480]  it's like shooting fishing and barrel folks they got a captive audience they open the schools they
[3:35:28.480 --> 3:35:33.920]  let in the kids test positive lock it down quarantine i spelled it out three times already
[3:35:34.560 --> 3:35:42.080]  the past 40 minutes you understand the option is homeschooling you can do it you can set it up
[3:35:42.720 --> 3:35:48.640]  there's got to be a lot of them if you want to keep your kids safe if you want to have that
[3:35:48.640 --> 3:36:02.400]  best option okay so we're seeing some giant retailers now starting to wake up i don't know
[3:36:02.400 --> 3:36:13.120]  is that too strong a word walmart lows wells target cvs some others here so now what they're
[3:36:13.120 --> 3:36:19.760]  saying is you know we said that you got to wear masks when you're in the stores talk a nation
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:30.400]  but now we've had a few incidents of a violent confrontation with our store employees where
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:34.720]  people didn't want to wear masks and so now we're saying whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
[3:36:35.360 --> 3:36:42.560]  wait a minute we're not going to do that we want you to wear masks but we're not going to insist on
[3:36:42.560 --> 3:36:49.440]  it if you walk in without a mask we might offer you a mask but if you don't take it that's fine
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:36:57.920]  maybe we'll maybe we'll have an alternate solution for shoppers so that they can get what they need
[3:36:57.920 --> 3:37:06.240]  in the store and check out whatever you know so they're claiming these retailers these giant
[3:37:06.240 --> 3:37:16.400]  stores that they're backing off on masks because of these incidents of you know violent confrontation
[3:37:17.360 --> 3:37:24.320]  that's baloney you know maybe the videos of these confrontations are going viral
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:36.480]  but the incidents are not going viral what they're saying is we want and we need more customers and
[3:37:36.480 --> 3:37:43.200]  a lot of people don't want to wear masks in the stores so we have to do something about it and
[3:37:43.200 --> 3:37:50.480]  this is what we're going to do we're going to let them in that's what's happened okay now here's
[3:37:50.480 --> 3:37:57.200]  where the rub comes in and it's kind of good in a way because you've got states where governors
[3:37:57.200 --> 3:38:08.240]  have issued these you know nazi like mao like edicts everybody has to wear a mask in public
[3:38:08.800 --> 3:38:15.680]  and then you've got outlets of these chain stores in those states that are saying to their
[3:38:15.680 --> 3:38:22.800]  employees don't require shoppers to wear masks so what's going to happen i don't know it's going
[3:38:22.800 --> 3:38:30.640]  to be interesting to see how it works out we'll see but the stores are issuing orders to their
[3:38:31.360 --> 3:38:39.680]  outlets and to their employees not to get into into consultations with people who don't wear masks
[3:38:39.680 --> 3:38:51.040]  no no no don't do that let them in and we'll just make it work this is also a signal that these big
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:59.280]  chains have decided that the people in the stores who are wearing masks don't care all that much
[3:38:59.280 --> 3:39:05.680]  about the people who aren't wearing masks they don't care enough to walk out of the store and
[3:39:05.680 --> 3:39:12.960]  say man i'm not going to shop there because they're letting people in without masks no
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:19.200]  they're just going to go about their business wearing their stupid masks and they're going to
[3:39:20.640 --> 3:39:24.720]  try to ignore the people that don't have masks on that's what's going to happen
[3:39:26.800 --> 3:39:33.680]  they figure so they're rolling back their orders and they're saying let them in if they don't have
[3:39:33.680 --> 3:39:41.600]  masks on we can all get along the mask wearers and the non-mask wearers and get their shopping done
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:54.240]  maybe maybe i'm saying maybe this is a glint of light on the horizon that large businesses
[3:39:54.240 --> 3:40:07.520]  are starting to rethink their insane stupid gutless surrendering posture toward the governors the
[3:40:07.520 --> 3:40:14.560]  mayors federal state of emergency the fouchie the bill gates the world health organization
[3:40:14.560 --> 3:40:23.760]  organization maybe some of these entities are starting to rethink how they've surrendered their
[3:40:24.720 --> 3:40:33.600]  power completely to these fleet frauds criminals harvesters of souls and children
[3:40:34.320 --> 3:40:38.080]  who are trying to destroy everything everything
[3:40:38.080 --> 3:40:47.920]  that humans are about because that's what's going on but that is what's going on
[3:40:49.440 --> 3:40:56.960]  look at the robots wearing the masks out there they are not behaving as humans anymore
[3:40:56.960 --> 3:41:08.640]  what are they some kind of hybrid creature they've turned themselves into that's what they've done
[3:41:09.280 --> 3:41:15.120]  they've submitted they've gone along for whatever reason under whatever pressure
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:22.320]  believing in whatever they believe and now they've turned themselves into something else
[3:41:22.320 --> 3:41:29.760]  the distancing oh don't get too close uh keep it
[3:41:31.520 --> 3:41:35.840]  so i have to start talking about freedom of assembly and what it means and the bill of
[3:41:35.840 --> 3:41:42.640]  rights and the constitution they're trying to destroy everything that is human
[3:41:44.080 --> 3:41:50.480]  everything that means anything with a fake story about a fake virus and fake tests
[3:41:50.480 --> 3:41:56.400]  that spit out false positives justifying the lockdowns the economic destruction and so on and
[3:41:56.400 --> 3:42:02.960]  so forth and the ruination of human lives the murders the suicides the drug abuse
[3:42:04.320 --> 3:42:11.040]  the family breakups the bankruptcies etc etc that are the real war that is going on
[3:42:11.040 --> 3:42:21.920]  on against the population of earth in phase one of this operation that's what it is that's what
[3:42:21.920 --> 3:42:31.680]  it's all about they use the language of science they use the terms of science they pretend that
[3:42:31.680 --> 3:42:38.320]  they are talking science but they're not talking anything it has to do with actual science they
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:48.400]  never have been i've been demonstrating that for 38 years right at the beginning i warned
[3:42:48.400 --> 3:42:54.160]  that the medical cartel was the most powerful cartel in the world long term because they fly
[3:42:54.160 --> 3:43:00.000]  under no political banner i've said this before i'll say it again they pretend neutrality we
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:06.480]  are here to heal and help and that's it and some of them are some of the individuals are
[3:43:06.480 --> 3:43:15.440]  are but above that you have the tear which i would call say the rockfeller tear the gates
[3:43:15.440 --> 3:43:20.480]  tear which is all about control power and destruction of humanity
[3:43:23.120 --> 3:43:32.480]  of you of family of you your children that's what's going on that's what we're dealing
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:40.640]  with all the predictions are coming true the money is just part of the money the profits
[3:43:40.640 --> 3:43:47.520]  the billions the trillions yes in any conspiracy there are levels of who benefits and how
[3:43:48.480 --> 3:43:54.400]  and no level has to be aware of any other level particularly except as you go up higher of course
[3:43:54.400 --> 3:44:04.400]  they're aware of everybody a few people at the top that's it it's pretty simple you got all this
[3:44:04.400 --> 3:44:08.480]  yammering in the press over the years out they couldn't be a conspiracy because too many people
[3:44:08.480 --> 3:44:15.920]  would have to know no they don't know they don't have to know it's ridiculous completely ridiculous
[3:44:15.920 --> 3:44:25.040]  anyway as i started out saying at the very top here this georgia doctor was lit on fire
[3:44:25.040 --> 3:44:28.800]  by what he realized was going to happen with vaccines when they become available
[3:44:29.680 --> 3:44:34.240]  but they're going to shut down schools right in the middle of the day they're going to make an
[3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:43.600]  emergency announcement ps 137 private school blah blah blah academy done lockdown quarantined
[3:44:43.600 --> 3:44:47.440]  your kids are there too bad they can't get out and you can't get in
[3:44:49.520 --> 3:44:56.480]  this has to be the beginning of a massive escalation in homeschool no matter what it takes
[3:44:56.480 --> 3:45:03.440]  what you have to do that's where we're at that's what's happened that's the response
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:13.360]  and it isn't just the schools that's what i'm focusing on today so get busy get aware
[3:45:13.360 --> 3:45:21.760]  get working with people that you know and do it and don't sacrifice your children see you next time
[3:45:21.760 --> 3:45:45.680]  this is john maverick we're done info wars
