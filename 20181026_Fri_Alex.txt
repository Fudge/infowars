[00:00:09.281 --> 00:00:15.214]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:33.581]  They have forensics investigators that can take the smallest speck and turn it into real evidence.
[00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:40.966]  And that's what they've been doing since they found that first attempted bomb at George Soros' house earlier this week.
[00:00:40.966 --> 00:00:46.330]  And the other issue here is that it appears to me that this is not a sophisticated bomb maker.
[00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.571]  If you're going to send out a dozen or more
[00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:54.596]  Oh, he didn't do a poor job at all, and I've been saying this over and over again, if the globalists and their minions get smart,
[00:01:17.853 --> 00:01:28.561]  They will go out and they will pose as conservatives, as nationalists, and they will take one for the team, and they will stage these events and blame us for it.
[00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:43.232]  You've got this van, we'll show TV viewers HD images of these, that are posted to InfoWars.com, with this van in Florida festooned over every square inch of the windows, except for the front windshield,
[00:01:44.502 --> 00:01:49.807]  With pro-Trump, pro-America, pro-Pence information.
[00:01:49.807 --> 00:02:05.243]  And you know when they get into his laptop, he's going to visit DrudgeReport.com, he's going to visit InfoWars.com, he's going to listen to Rush Limbaugh, he's going to watch Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson, just wait 11 days out from this incredibly
[00:02:06.673 --> 00:02:07.554]  Historic election.
[00:02:07.554 --> 00:02:15.538]  And remember, we saw them pre-programming everywhere that Republicans are going to get violent, but Trump and Alex Jones are going to cause shootings and bombings of Democrats.
[00:02:15.538 --> 00:02:26.825]  And then magically, the kingpin, leading the globalist invasion of America, the open borders, George Soros, hierarchically, he gets the first fake bomb.
[00:02:26.825 --> 00:02:31.668]  And I have the police commissioner, NYPD, saying the package bombs are not bombs.
[00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:35.931]  In fact, the ones New York got don't even have powder in them.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.281]  They are fake.
[00:02:39.281 --> 00:02:41.241]  They are fake.
[00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:44.063]  They are fake.
[00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:50.705]  And this whole thing, there it is, pipe bomb and powdered liberty, CNN, we're harmless.
[00:02:50.705 --> 00:02:53.726]  That's all confirmed by the police commissioner.
[00:02:53.726 --> 00:03:00.189]  But it's only in InfoWars.com and DrugsReport.com and National Review and a few places.
[00:03:02.386 --> 00:03:05.428]  So, again, it's the perfect Patsy.
[00:03:05.428 --> 00:03:12.553]  I even said on Monday, they'll bust him in a van with Trump stickers all over it.
[00:03:12.553 --> 00:03:15.155]  I said that!
[00:03:15.155 --> 00:03:15.735]  I said it!
[00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:22.200]  I mean, we just... Because it's central scripting, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.904]  This is the most insane crap I've ever seen, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:28.904 --> 00:03:30.886]  And now they've got it loaded on the back of a record.
[00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:39.673]  Being driven to the FBI offices there in Florida.
[00:03:39.673 --> 00:03:40.794]  This is just incredible.
[00:03:40.794 --> 00:03:42.295]  This is in South Florida.
[00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:45.737]  He's in custody in connection with the mailing of pipe bombs.
[00:03:45.737 --> 00:03:52.121]  Notice that Boing Boing and Bloomberg and all of them and CNN keep calling it pipe bombs.
[00:03:52.121 --> 00:03:55.003]  No, they're not pipe bombs.
[00:03:55.003 --> 00:04:00.127]  This bottle of Honor Roll fish and krill oil is not a bomb.
[00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:06.777]  It's like bringing one of the fake bombs we made with road flares and egg timers on them.
[00:04:06.777 --> 00:04:11.520]  Those look more real and are more dangerous than these fake bombs.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.362]  Because you could light one of these road flares and burn down a building with them.
[00:04:16.362 --> 00:04:20.185]  So technically it's not a bomb, but it's an incendiary device.
[00:04:20.185 --> 00:04:26.128]  So the bombs we made in five minutes yesterday are more real than that fake bomb.
[00:04:29.107 --> 00:04:33.390]  So just think about how insane this is.
[00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:46.160]  And how right on time, 14 days out Soros, 13 days out the Clintons, Obama, all these poor little victims that have been calling for violence and calling for, you know, killing members of Congress and calling for killing Trump.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.122]  The Democrats, it's New York Times' articles about killing Trump.
[00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:51.444]  Phil Mudd goes on CNN, says we're going to kill Trump.
[00:04:51.444 --> 00:04:54.787]  And then magically, they all keep saying, Trump's going to get us killed.
[00:04:54.787 --> 00:04:57.389]  And then magically, this happens right on time.
[00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:58.670]  Fake bombs get mailed out.
[00:05:00.373 --> 00:05:04.291]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[00:05:05.623 --> 00:05:13.685]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[00:05:13.685 --> 00:05:16.305]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[00:05:16.305 --> 00:05:19.746]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:22.366]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[00:05:22.366 --> 00:05:24.647]  So we've already had incredible success.
[00:05:24.647 --> 00:05:31.608]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:41.955]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:43.136]  We'll win.
[00:05:43.136 --> 00:05:45.458]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[00:05:45.458 --> 00:05:53.184]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[00:05:53.184 --> 00:05:56.887]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[00:05:56.887 --> 00:05:58.448]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[00:05:58.448 --> 00:05:59.128]  We need your support.
[00:05:59.128 --> 00:05:59.849]  I'm counting on you.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.953]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:12.953 --> 00:06:16.382]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:06:30.888 --> 00:06:32.249]  We have a video.
[00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:38.092]  The police commissioner of New York City says this was not a group of bombs that were mailed.
[00:06:38.092 --> 00:06:40.993]  Repeat, these were not bombs.
[00:06:40.993 --> 00:06:48.417]  These were inert powder inside plastic casings with shards of glass with wire sticking out of it to cause fear.
[00:06:48.417 --> 00:06:56.482]  And it's been totally blamed on Trump, on Infowars, on anyone criticizing Soros and all of his criminal activities that are legendary.
[00:06:57.386 --> 00:07:01.548]  President Trump is set to speak on this in just mere minutes.
[00:07:01.548 --> 00:07:09.613]  Again, in South Florida, people called in the suspicious white van with hundreds of pro-Trump, pro-America stickers on it.
[00:07:09.613 --> 00:07:12.615]  He reportedly is a Caucasian male.
[00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:15.777]  His name has not been released yet, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:21.517]  But right on time, we have all the images of who's guilty.
[00:07:21.517 --> 00:07:23.297]  That's right, by extension.
[00:07:23.297 --> 00:07:26.098]  Crosshairs on Hillary Clinton.
[00:07:26.098 --> 00:07:27.318]  Donald Trump stickers.
[00:07:27.318 --> 00:07:30.219]  Mike Pence stickers.
[00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:38.260]  It goes on and on from there and now he has been grabbed off the street and we're all seeing the white van.
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.361]  So we hear for months and months and months that
[00:07:43.075 --> 00:07:52.199]  Trump is going to cause violence, and that Trump is an evil person that wants the media to be attacked when he points out that they're lying about him.
[00:07:52.199 --> 00:08:02.323]  When they call him a Nazi, or they call him Hitler, or they say he hates all Mexicans, or all these incredible lies, if he dare defend himself, usually even in a joking manner back, calling, well, that's a fake news reporter.
[00:08:02.323 --> 00:08:05.404]  You know, Mr. Acosta is a fake reporter.
[00:08:05.404 --> 00:08:07.645]  They go, oh my God, you want me to die?
[00:08:07.645 --> 00:08:08.786]  You want to kill us?
[00:08:09.633 --> 00:08:11.534]  We're like, that's disproportionate.
[00:08:11.534 --> 00:08:33.622]  If all we do is respond back to you, and then it's the end of the world, and then real riots and gets mailed out to the president, and to the vice president, and to Ted Cruz, and a bunch of other people, and then that's all swept under the rug, and there's almost no news coverage of it, and then this gets huge wall-to-wall coverage, not the 50,000 legal aliens marching towards the U.S.
[00:08:33.622 --> 00:08:35.123]  or riding in on flatback trailers.
[00:08:37.086 --> 00:08:44.491]  Not what's happening with China threatening war with the U.S., not getting into what's happening on the stock market, none of it.
[00:08:44.491 --> 00:08:49.315]  It's all, ladies and gentlemen, these fake bombs.
[00:08:49.315 --> 00:08:58.341]  But again, I have a stack of news here admitting pipe bombs and powder delivered to CNN were harmless.
[00:08:58.341 --> 00:09:04.345]  New York City Police Headquarters told the Associated Press on Monday.
[00:09:06.345 --> 00:09:07.826]  So I'm going to say it again.
[00:09:07.826 --> 00:09:11.489]  No bombs were mailed.
[00:09:11.489 --> 00:09:13.651]  Hoax bombs were mailed.
[00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:25.521]  But you look at the rest of the news, it's bombs, bombs, bomber, bomber in custody, bomber in South Florida, bomber in a white van, bomber had right-wing Trump stickers on his car.
[00:09:25.521 --> 00:09:28.063]  That's not a bomber.
[00:09:28.063 --> 00:09:32.546]  If you mail real bombs to people and any of them detonate, you're a bomber.
[00:09:32.546 --> 00:09:35.749]  If you mail fake bombs to people, you're a hoaxer.
[00:09:37.901 --> 00:09:39.261]  Got him!
[00:09:39.261 --> 00:09:40.082]  Mega bomber!
[00:09:40.082 --> 00:09:41.642]  Suspect in custody!
[00:09:41.642 --> 00:09:42.763]  Trump to go live!
[00:09:42.763 --> 00:09:44.803]  That's DrudgeReport.com headline.
[00:09:44.803 --> 00:09:51.246]  We have the live feeds posted at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com as well.
[00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:55.227]  So, who called this the entire time?
[00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:56.847]  The pre-programming?
[00:09:56.847 --> 00:10:07.231]  That, wait, there's going to be violence right before the election, and the media and the Democrats will be targeted, and it is talk radio and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Donald Trump and the Republican Party's fault.
[00:10:08.547 --> 00:10:13.489]  And the Republicans are calling for violence when we weren't calling for violence.
[00:10:13.489 --> 00:10:14.329]  It's the Democrats.
[00:10:14.329 --> 00:10:21.632]  So they were having a problem with all their violence and jobs not mobs, jobs not open borders and collapsing civilization.
[00:10:21.632 --> 00:10:22.392]  So what happens?
[00:10:22.392 --> 00:10:24.773]  Well, the game changer happens.
[00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:27.871]  The Game Changer happens.
[00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:30.353]  Magically, the bombs get mailed out.
[00:10:30.353 --> 00:10:32.075]  They're fake bombs.
[00:10:32.075 --> 00:10:42.365]  The car, the truck, the van looks like something out of Central Casting, a white creeper van with every window except the windshield covered.
[00:10:42.365 --> 00:10:45.608]  With dishonest media, CNN sucks.
[00:10:45.608 --> 00:10:47.370]  I mean, this looks like this was produced.
[00:10:49.234 --> 00:10:50.134]  At a Hollywood lot.
[00:10:50.134 --> 00:10:51.895]  These aren't old peeling stickers.
[00:10:51.895 --> 00:10:53.857]  These aren't stickers over other stickers.
[00:10:53.857 --> 00:11:01.182]  This doesn't look like any van we've ever seen, you know, where it's a real Patriot with a bunch of stickers.
[00:11:01.182 --> 00:11:05.625]  Native Americans for Trump.
[00:11:05.625 --> 00:11:10.049]  My president is Donald Trump.
[00:11:10.049 --> 00:11:12.350]  I am Donald Trump and I approve of this message.
[00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.553]  Crosshairs on Michael Moore.
[00:11:15.553 --> 00:11:17.254]  Crosshairs on Van Jones.
[00:11:19.974 --> 00:11:27.076]  Crosshairs on all these people so they can be the victims.
[00:11:27.076 --> 00:11:28.977]  Soccer recruits for Trump.
[00:11:28.977 --> 00:11:40.360]  So every group out there can now be demonized because they're associated with the fake bombs that the establishment corporate collaborator media is still saying are real.
[00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:56.239]  Let's put again on screen there, you can see if you're a TV viewer, like this is the OJ Simpson Chase or something, the wrecker with the creeper van loaded in the back, and then soon we'll learn what was on his laptop.
[00:11:56.239 --> 00:11:58.662]  And well, the number one news site in the world's grudge report.
[00:11:58.662 --> 00:11:59.402]  Everybody visits it.
[00:12:00.177 --> 00:12:01.539]  It'll be there.
[00:12:01.539 --> 00:12:05.223]  Fox News, the biggest TV network in the world.
[00:12:05.223 --> 00:12:06.144]  It'll be on there.
[00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:11.370]  And you know InfoWars.com and Alex Jones will be there.
[00:12:11.370 --> 00:12:12.211]  There aren't many.
[00:12:13.382 --> 00:12:17.266]  Computers in America that haven't visited InfoWars.com.
[00:12:17.266 --> 00:12:20.749]  There aren't many cell phones where people haven't visited InfoWars.com.
[00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:23.312]  And so guilt by extension, you see?
[00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:30.659]  Just like the op-ed by Alexander Soros the day after his daddy got mailed that little 5-inch fake firecracker.
[00:12:31.741 --> 00:12:35.962]  He said it's the rhetoric of the Republicans and Trump that's causing this.
[00:12:35.962 --> 00:12:46.125]  When he funds Antifa, we have the documents January of this year to cause violence and to try to create, quote, a civil emergency.
[00:12:46.125 --> 00:12:49.766]  Alexander Soros now runs the whole situation for Daddy.
[00:12:49.766 --> 00:12:51.787]  He's taken over.
[00:12:51.787 --> 00:12:53.027]  He runs the Political Action Committee.
[00:12:53.027 --> 00:12:55.128]  He's hundreds of millions a year doled out in America alone.
[00:12:56.121 --> 00:13:02.604]  And man, you see, you criticize him, you criticize anything he's ever done, it's your fault.
[00:13:02.604 --> 00:13:07.427]  And we're waiting for President Trump to come out any minute now and speak.
[00:13:07.427 --> 00:13:09.428]  But boy, Colbert was confident.
[00:13:09.428 --> 00:13:13.770]  He said, we've got who the bomber is.
[00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:15.511]  It's Make America Great Again.
[00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:22.314]  And they put that hat on Theodore Kaczynski, the unibomber who just so happened to work for the CIA
[00:13:23.675 --> 00:13:26.017]  For 30 years.
[00:13:26.017 --> 00:13:26.557]  That's L.A.
[00:13:26.557 --> 00:13:29.219]  Times.
[00:13:29.219 --> 00:13:34.182]  Google search engine, Theodore Kaczynski, Unabomber, CIA.
[00:13:34.182 --> 00:13:47.171]  And of course it turned out that whole deal was staged as well by another leftist, Theodore Kaczynski, who was willing to take the blame for a larger project.
[00:13:47.171 --> 00:13:47.851]  And as the M.O.
[00:13:47.851 --> 00:13:48.272]  emerges,
[00:13:49.636 --> 00:14:02.546]  This person's either going to be a mentally ill patsy they've set up, or he's going to be a hardcore leftist with university ties who recently has become a conservative, kind of like all the white supremacist leaders that led Charlottesville.
[00:14:02.546 --> 00:14:10.812]  Their parents worked for Obama, worked for Hillary, all of them a year before worked for Obama or Hillary, and basically it's just like a liberal
[00:14:12.148 --> 00:14:15.829]  Theater club that go out and pose as Nazis.
[00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:16.909]  Total theater.
[00:14:16.909 --> 00:14:29.632]  Just like in the Alexander Soros documents where they wanted martial law in Maryland, triggering race war, it talks about doing the event and acting and what they're allowed to burn and what the police have been told they're going to target.
[00:14:29.632 --> 00:14:34.613]  And they've got the van out of central casting right on time with the person willing to go to prison.
[00:14:35.782 --> 00:14:39.125]  To frame America and frame Trump for fake bombs.
[00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:44.490]  The whole thing, the timing, the whole nine yards, it's staged.
[00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:50.956]  Now that's my best approximation and they wanted me censored and off the air before.
[00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:53.726]  They staged all this, but they haven't.
[00:14:53.726 --> 00:15:02.450]  We're on hundreds of stations, and we're huge at InfoWars.com, but you have to go to InfoWars.com and get the live feeds that break down the fact.
[00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:05.212]  Let's go to InfoWars.com, just the front page.
[00:15:05.212 --> 00:15:10.294]  They can grab the feed and email it and text it and send it out to everyone they know.
[00:15:10.294 --> 00:15:14.757]  So if you go to InfoWars.com front page, show me real quick please, crew.
[00:15:14.757 --> 00:15:18.879]  I will direct people to the proper headline for the live show.
[00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:20.199]  It says, watch live.
[00:15:20.199 --> 00:15:21.060]  Scroll down a bit, please.
[00:15:24.011 --> 00:15:30.558]  To the main feed area above that.
[00:15:30.558 --> 00:15:34.001]  And then, through the scroller, click it a few times.
[00:15:34.001 --> 00:15:35.423]  Rightwards says Migrant Caravan.
[00:15:35.423 --> 00:15:36.764]  Thank you.
[00:15:36.764 --> 00:15:37.945]  Click it again, please.
[00:15:37.945 --> 00:15:39.086]  Click it again, please.
[00:15:39.086 --> 00:15:40.628]  Click it again, please.
[00:15:40.628 --> 00:15:43.471]  Looks like we didn't send out a live feed, Link.
[00:15:43.471 --> 00:15:45.352]  But, it'll be there.
[00:15:45.352 --> 00:15:46.714]  Oh, we need to hit refresh.
[00:15:46.714 --> 00:15:47.294]  Watch live.
[00:15:48.257 --> 00:15:51.685]  And it'll be right there and you can send that link out to everyone.
[00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:54.492]  As soon as the president goes live, we'll go right to it.
[00:15:54.492 --> 00:15:57.759]  What else will the deep state pull with only 11 days out?
[00:15:59.815 --> 00:16:01.016]  Hear that?
[00:16:01.016 --> 00:16:06.398]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[00:16:06.398 --> 00:16:09.299]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[00:16:09.299 --> 00:16:12.880]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:20.463]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.

[00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:34.387]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[00:16:34.387 --> 00:16:40.249]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:46.771]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[00:16:46.771 --> 00:16:50.812]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[00:16:59.395 --> 00:17:00.295]  It's a no-brainer.
[00:17:00.295 --> 00:17:02.717]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[00:17:02.717 --> 00:17:10.840]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.781]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[00:18:00.191 --> 00:18:03.775]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:18:03.775 --> 00:18:05.557]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:18:05.557 --> 00:18:16.828]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:18:17.589 --> 00:18:26.794]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:18:26.794 --> 00:18:32.737]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:18:32.737 --> 00:18:37.319]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:18:37.839 --> 00:18:40.462]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[00:18:40.462 --> 00:18:42.184]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:18:42.184 --> 00:18:52.175]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:18:52.175 --> 00:18:54.817]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:18:54.817 --> 00:18:59.543]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:19:00.211 --> 00:19:02.553]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[00:19:02.553 --> 00:19:04.714]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:19:04.714 --> 00:19:08.637]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[00:19:44.364 --> 00:19:45.245]  Sold out in a month!
[00:19:46.092 --> 00:19:48.233]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:20:13.141 --> 00:20:15.762]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:15.762 --> 00:20:24.526]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:24.526 --> 00:20:26.027]  Here we are.
[00:20:26.027 --> 00:20:30.589]  Only 11 days out, ladies and gentlemen, from this historic election.
[00:20:30.589 --> 00:20:31.789]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:20:31.789 --> 00:20:33.590]  We have breaking news.
[00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:39.153]  Turns out the gentleman, the suspect in the white van festooned with the Trump stickers, had lived in
[00:20:41.508 --> 00:20:43.429]  New York City, recently gone to Florida.
[00:20:43.429 --> 00:20:48.112]  The vehicle's covered in Seminole Native American tribal stickers.
[00:20:48.112 --> 00:20:50.874]  The name of the company on the van is tied to Native Americans.
[00:20:50.874 --> 00:20:58.820]  They're saying he's a white male who was known to law enforcement for making threats, but again, nothing had been done.
[00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:04.966]  Just like we saw the threats being made supposedly there in Parkland, but nothing was done.
[00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:16.538]  Over and over again, and now right on time, 14 days out, now 11 days out, on Hillary Clinton's birthday today, we have this unfolding.
[00:21:16.538 --> 00:21:20.382]  So let's go ahead and go to this breaking news on Fox News.
[00:21:21.298 --> 00:21:30.421]  Just to recap, the suspect has been identified to Fox News as a white male in his 50s, former New Yorker, and now residing in Florida.
[00:21:30.421 --> 00:21:39.225]  And someone who has a prior history with law enforcement, who's known to them, has a history of what are called terroristic threats.
[00:21:39.225 --> 00:21:42.886]  I want to just drill down on that for a moment so people understand what that really involves.
[00:21:43.446 --> 00:21:53.113]  Terrorist threats under the law means that you are threatening to commit an act of violence against an individual or physical property.
[00:21:53.113 --> 00:21:59.217]  And it also can include threats designed to influence a branch of government or politics.
[00:21:59.217 --> 00:22:05.661]  So I'm going to be paying close attention to that as we wait to hear from the President, the Justice Department, and the Homeland Security Secretary.
[00:22:06.241 --> 00:22:12.325]  I'll provide you with an update on the suspicious package investigations we're conducting here in New York City.
[00:22:12.325 --> 00:22:17.528]  First and foremost, my message today is that New Yorkers are safe.
[00:22:17.528 --> 00:22:24.052]  There are no current credible threats to any individuals, organizations, or locations here in New York City.
[00:22:24.052 --> 00:22:34.939]  New Yorkers are safe, but everyone, all 8.6 million residents, and the millions of visitors who come here every year, should always remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings.
[00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:38.712]  That is the New York Police Commissioner.
[00:22:38.712 --> 00:22:42.996]  Pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless.
[00:22:42.996 --> 00:22:46.740]  All other bombs had no explosives in them.
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.863]  They were not bombs.
[00:22:49.863 --> 00:22:57.209]  You know, you've driven out in the desert and you've seen those tourist traps that'll have a fake Tyrannosaurus Rex, a fake Stegosaurus, a fake
[00:22:58.260 --> 00:23:08.408]  Triceratops, you get out with your kid and you run around them out there, and then you go in some five and dime place and maybe buy a soda and a candy bar with your parents before you get back on the road to Death Valley.
[00:23:08.408 --> 00:23:12.391]  Those aren't real dinosaurs.
[00:23:12.391 --> 00:23:18.455]  So if you run your car into one and die, a dinosaur didn't kill you, you ran into concrete and died.
[00:23:18.455 --> 00:23:24.940]  Well, if a bomb isn't a bomb and won't even smoke, it's not a bomb.
[00:23:28.097 --> 00:23:28.798]  Here's another example.
[00:23:28.798 --> 00:23:37.224]  You've seen those steakhouses where they'll have a cow, a plastic cow, up on top of the building for attention, so you know there's beef there?
[00:23:37.224 --> 00:23:39.745]  That's not really a cow.
[00:23:39.745 --> 00:23:42.367]  That's not a real cow.
[00:23:42.367 --> 00:23:45.409]  Okay, we have the suspect here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:45.409 --> 00:23:50.493]  They were calling him a white male, but he does look like he has some Native American or at least Hispanic in him.
[00:23:50.493 --> 00:23:53.515]  Suspect, mail bomber, identified as Caesar
[00:23:55.347 --> 00:23:57.609]  Altair, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[00:23:57.609 --> 00:24:00.771]  A-L-T-I-E-R.
[00:24:00.771 --> 00:24:02.932]  Altair.
[00:24:02.932 --> 00:24:04.773]  And this is out of the Daily Mail.
[00:24:04.773 --> 00:24:06.854]  Again, I'm not reporting that that's who this is.
[00:24:06.854 --> 00:24:10.817]  I'm reporting on the Daily Mail.
[00:24:10.817 --> 00:24:23.945]  Cesar Altair Sayoc was taken into custody on Friday morning in Plantation, Florida, in connection with the bombs.
[00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:24.726]  The suspect is
[00:24:27.256 --> 00:24:31.839]  A mail-bombing spree targeting critics of President Donald Trump.
[00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:34.680]  A mail-bombing spree.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:39.243]  It was not a bomb.
[00:24:39.243 --> 00:24:41.184]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:24:41.184 --> 00:24:44.786]  Will you guys give me a wide shot here in the studio?
[00:24:44.786 --> 00:24:54.051]  That is a bronze recreation of a famous statue of the battle, what was it, Gallipoli,
[00:24:55.592 --> 00:24:56.272]  Thermopylae.
[00:24:56.272 --> 00:24:58.253]  I'm going from memory teleprompter 3 here.
[00:24:58.253 --> 00:24:59.894]  Thermopylae.
[00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:03.876]  Lost the Battle of Marathon so many.
[00:25:03.876 --> 00:25:04.817]  For the Battle of 300.
[00:25:04.817 --> 00:25:09.179]  That is not a real Spartan soldier right there.
[00:25:09.179 --> 00:25:12.341]  That is a recreation.
[00:25:12.341 --> 00:25:16.963]  I know you're saying, yes Alex, we know that that is not a real Spartan soldier.
[00:25:16.963 --> 00:25:19.584]  We understand from 3,000 years ago.
[00:25:19.584 --> 00:25:20.545]  I know you know that.
[00:25:21.735 --> 00:25:27.344]  But I'm trying to explain to Democrats and CNN and everybody else that we don't buy your hoax.
[00:25:27.344 --> 00:25:30.589]  That these fake bombs were real bombs.
[00:25:30.589 --> 00:25:33.614]  And I don't buy any of the rest of your story.
[00:25:33.614 --> 00:25:36.159]  I mean, you've got this guy, they're calling a white male.
[00:25:39.724 --> 00:25:46.229]  And if you showed that picture to a thousand people, they would say he looks Hispanic or Native American, which is fine.
[00:25:46.229 --> 00:25:49.952]  I'm not trying to blame some group on race here.
[00:25:49.952 --> 00:25:52.114]  I'm saying none of this adds up.
[00:25:52.114 --> 00:25:53.815]  The van looks fake.
[00:25:53.815 --> 00:26:03.162]  The timing, the fact that the media hypes there's gonna be all this violence against Democrats, and it's coming, it's coming, and it's Trump's fault, it's Alex Jones' fault, it's the free press's fault.
[00:26:03.162 --> 00:26:06.625]  Then fake bombs get mailed out.
[00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:08.847]  His van looks like something out of Central Casting.
[00:26:11.434 --> 00:26:13.976]  And now this happens.
[00:26:13.976 --> 00:26:20.380]  They're calling him a white male, and I guess he could identify as white.
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:25.744]  And now we've got photos of him coming out at Blacks for Trump and other rallies.
[00:26:25.744 --> 00:26:29.046]  I don't think we know what's really going on here, but I'll tell you this.
[00:26:29.046 --> 00:26:39.173]  If you had all this pre-programming by the Democrats that the Republicans were going to kill him, and there was no proof of it, and then magically it happens, and the guy sends out fake bombs to the perfect list of globalists,
[00:26:39.912 --> 00:26:44.555]  When it could only help them 14 days out from the election when this started.
[00:26:44.555 --> 00:26:46.376]  We're now 11 days out.
[00:26:46.376 --> 00:26:57.644]  This guy is the biggest idiot on the planet and is a total moron and can't find his ass with both hands to save his life or this whole thing's fake.
[00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:09.680]  And do you think somebody like this would have the perfect white van with all the stickers covering every window perfectly, so that when this happened it would have the iconography of Trump?
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:14.901]  I mean, this is as phony as anything I've ever seen in my life.
[00:27:14.901 --> 00:27:17.362]  It's more phony than a plastic banana.
[00:27:17.362 --> 00:27:20.103]  It's more phony than Obama's birth certificate.
[00:27:20.103 --> 00:27:23.784]  It is more phony than Hillary saying she has a clean bill of health.
[00:27:25.882 --> 00:27:30.365]  This is unbelievable and we're here waiting for Trump to come out and we will cover it all.
[00:27:30.365 --> 00:27:31.586]  Show!
[00:27:31.586 --> 00:27:43.796]  Suspect was known to authorities and they let it happen again just like the Boston bombing they were known and had been allowed to go to Eastern Europe and to the stands and to
[00:27:46.286 --> 00:27:55.369]  Areas connected to CIA operations, and have even been given fake passports that the Russians pointed out, the Tsarnaev brothers, and the same story over and over again.
[00:27:55.369 --> 00:28:04.472]  The nightclub shooter in Florida at Pulse nightclub was part of a Homeland Security detail, and his father then shows up bizarrely behind Hillary at one of her events.
[00:28:04.472 --> 00:28:06.432]  This is just crazy!
[00:28:06.432 --> 00:28:09.373]  With perfect timing!
[00:28:09.373 --> 00:28:11.274]  All of this happens.
[00:28:11.274 --> 00:28:12.715]  What do you think's happening?
[00:28:12.715 --> 00:28:13.975]  We're gonna come back, get to Trump,
[00:28:15.646 --> 00:28:20.129]  Soon as he goes live, and then we'll open the phones up and take your calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:28:20.129 --> 00:28:24.312]  I took a lot of calls from military and law enforcement and EOD people yesterday.
[00:28:24.312 --> 00:28:25.252]  I got to almost all of you.
[00:28:25.252 --> 00:28:26.733]  Four or five were left at the end of the show.
[00:28:26.733 --> 00:28:28.334]  If you can call back in, that's great.
[00:28:28.334 --> 00:28:38.821]  But law enforcement, military, EOD, and also detectives, give me your angle on this and what you think's happening, and why none of this adds up, in my view, unless it's a false flag stage Patsy event.
[00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:43.486]  I haven't said, I bet they find something crazy with Trump stickers all over it and InfoWars stickers.
[00:28:43.486 --> 00:28:45.849]  Thank God none of those.
[00:28:45.849 --> 00:28:47.330]  And in the next few days.
[00:28:47.330 --> 00:28:48.712]  I said that on Monday.
[00:28:48.712 --> 00:28:50.514]  So what do you think is going on?
[00:28:50.514 --> 00:28:52.116]  I'll give that number out when we come back.

[00:30:03.701 --> 00:30:05.222]  During the falls, they'd have it during the winter.

[00:31:00.217 --> 00:31:08.606]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym, or to go for a run, or go to the park, or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[00:31:08.606 --> 00:31:10.068]  Believe me, I know.
[00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:14.773]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[00:31:14.773 --> 00:31:17.857]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[00:31:18.317 --> 00:31:19.999]  I still have that energy.
[00:31:19.999 --> 00:31:40.158]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[00:31:40.658 --> 00:31:44.659]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.

[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.322]  So I want you to experience Supermail Vitality before it's too late.
[00:31:53.322 --> 00:31:56.042]  Unleash the Supermail in you.

[00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:04.112]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[00:32:04.112 --> 00:32:07.393]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[00:32:07.393 --> 00:32:13.655]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[00:32:13.655 --> 00:32:16.436]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[00:32:17.176 --> 00:32:20.999]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[00:32:20.999 --> 00:32:27.463]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[00:32:27.463 --> 00:32:32.427]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[00:32:33.174 --> 00:32:37.116]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[00:32:37.116 --> 00:32:44.299]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[00:32:44.299 --> 00:32:49.521]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[00:32:49.521 --> 00:32:55.223]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:59.185]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[00:33:03.797 --> 00:33:18.043]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:18.043 --> 00:33:28.907]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide
[00:33:33.121 --> 00:33:36.322]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:36.322 --> 00:33:44.525]  And as we speak, the president was set to talk to a black leadership conference of amazing folks like Candace Owens and others.
[00:33:44.525 --> 00:33:47.866]  And that conference is just now starting, so let's go ahead and go to it right now.
[00:33:47.866 --> 00:33:51.048]  Here is the president coming out and beginning to make comments.
[00:33:51.048 --> 00:34:01.391]  The White House, he is at a youth black conference, leadership conference, but expected, according to his own Twitter feed, to begin with comments about the suspicious packages investigation.
[00:34:01.391 --> 00:34:01.872]  Let's watch.
[00:34:06.988 --> 00:34:10.250]  Thank you very much.
[00:34:10.250 --> 00:34:19.797]  What a group!
[00:34:19.797 --> 00:34:20.337]  What a group!
[00:34:20.337 --> 00:34:20.978]  Thank you very much.
[00:34:20.978 --> 00:34:23.139]  What a great honor to have you.
[00:34:23.139 --> 00:34:23.459]  Thank you.
[00:34:23.459 --> 00:34:25.621]  It is a great, great honor to have you in the White House.
[00:34:25.621 --> 00:34:26.482]  Thank you very much.
[00:34:31.533 --> 00:34:40.546]  They call this, as you know, this is Young Black Leadership and it's the summit and to have you here is truly my privilege.
[00:34:40.546 --> 00:34:42.829]  And we're going to have a lot of fun, we're going to talk, we're going to meet.
[00:34:47.673 --> 00:35:09.018]  Before I do, I'd like to begin, and you are leaders, you're real leaders, I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been mailed to high profile figures throughout our country and a media organization.
[00:35:09.018 --> 00:35:14.559]  I am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended
[00:35:15.239 --> 00:35:23.485]  The suspect and taken him into custody.
[00:35:23.485 --> 00:35:25.687]  Incredible job by law enforcement.
[00:35:25.687 --> 00:35:35.514]  We've carried out a far reaching federal, state and local investigation to find the person or persons responsible for these events.
[00:35:35.514 --> 00:35:40.638]  These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country.
[00:35:43.644 --> 00:35:56.209]  I've instructed authorities to spare no resource or expense in finding those responsible and bringing them to swift and certain justice.
[00:35:56.209 --> 00:36:06.193]  And we will prosecute them, him, her, whoever it may be, to the fullest extent of the law.
[00:36:09.398 --> 00:36:14.521]  We must never allow political violence to take root in America.
[00:36:14.521 --> 00:36:15.681]  Cannot let it happen.
[00:36:15.681 --> 00:36:20.704]  And I'm committed to doing everything in my power as president to stop it.
[00:36:27.975 --> 00:36:34.442]  I've just concluded a briefing with the Department of Justice following the apprehension of the suspect.
[00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:39.047]  I want to applaud the FBI, Secret Service, the Department of Justice.
[00:36:39.648 --> 00:36:40.148]  The U.S.
[00:36:40.148 --> 00:36:47.975]  Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, the NYPD, and all law enforcement throughout the entire country.
[00:36:47.975 --> 00:36:49.756]  Incredible partners.
[00:36:49.756 --> 00:37:00.845]  These people have worked so hard, and to have done it so quickly, it's looking like you're looking... And we don't know what happened yet, but he was known in New York and made threats.
[00:37:00.845 --> 00:37:01.726]  Incredible job.
[00:37:01.726 --> 00:37:03.207]  So why was he allowed to do that?
[00:37:03.207 --> 00:37:04.368]  It's the same crap all the time.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.962]  It's because people just accept this and they won't indict anybody.
[00:37:08.962 --> 00:37:11.563]  The bottom line is that Americans must unify.
[00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:19.427]  And we must show the world that we are united together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens.
[00:37:19.427 --> 00:37:22.549]  There is no country like our country.
[00:37:22.549 --> 00:37:27.911]  And every day we are showing the world just how truly great we are.
[00:37:29.592 --> 00:37:33.193]  So, you are really very special people.
[00:37:33.193 --> 00:37:36.295]  I wanted to say that before our little talk.
[00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:39.036]  And I appreciate the time you've given me.
[00:37:39.036 --> 00:37:43.357]  And, boy, one day, one of you is going to be standing.
[00:37:43.357 --> 00:37:45.238]  It could be three or four of you, actually.
[00:37:45.238 --> 00:37:47.399]  But you're going to be standing right here.
[00:37:47.399 --> 00:37:50.380]  You're going to be standing right here.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.960]  I have no doubt.
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:54.181]  I have no doubt.
[00:37:54.181 --> 00:37:58.543]  Who in this room wants to be president someday?
[00:38:01.866 --> 00:38:04.467]  So it's an ambitious group.
[00:38:04.467 --> 00:38:05.827]  It's an ambitious group.
[00:38:05.827 --> 00:38:06.887]  That's great.
[00:38:06.887 --> 00:38:09.028]  Anyway, thank you all very much.
[00:38:09.028 --> 00:38:10.188]  I really appreciate it.
[00:38:10.188 --> 00:38:12.148]  For the media, thank you very much.
[00:38:12.148 --> 00:38:15.849]  I thought I'd do that, and we feel very strongly.
[00:38:15.849 --> 00:38:19.570]  Again, congratulations to all law enforcement.
[00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:21.691]  We have the best in the world, and they just showed it.
[00:38:21.691 --> 00:38:23.351]  Thank you very much.
[00:38:23.351 --> 00:38:27.772]  And let's be clear, a lot of times the police do try to stop people making threats.
[00:38:27.772 --> 00:38:29.953]  They look like they're credible, but the grand juries won't indict them.
[00:38:29.953 --> 00:38:31.113]  Now to the subject at hand.
[00:38:33.925 --> 00:38:41.490]  And it is my great honor to be with so many brilliant, and that's what you are, brilliant, courageous, patriotic, and proud Americans.
[00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:43.671]  By the way, guys, I know we have a satellite feed of this.
[00:38:43.671 --> 00:38:45.032]  Let's go to our satellite feed.
[00:38:45.032 --> 00:38:46.493]  I just wanted the Fox feed.
[00:38:46.493 --> 00:38:51.136]  With an extraordinary confidence in- Because Trump's a few minutes actually ahead here.
[00:38:51.136 --> 00:38:53.297]  The great, great future of our country.
[00:38:53.297 --> 00:38:55.558]  Each of you is taking part.
[00:38:55.558 --> 00:38:57.059]  Thank you so much, Candace.
[00:38:57.059 --> 00:38:57.560]  Thank you.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:57.920]  Thank you.
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:38:58.400]  Thank you, man.
[00:39:01.736 --> 00:39:04.798]  Each of you represents the future of our nation.
[00:39:04.798 --> 00:39:06.039]  You know that.
[00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:10.982]  You are not afraid to stand up for your beliefs or stand against injustice.
[00:39:10.982 --> 00:39:16.865]  You refuse to be told by the same failed voices how to think or what to believe.
[00:39:16.865 --> 00:39:17.645]  You understand that.
[00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:21.699]  This is live right now.
[00:39:21.699 --> 00:39:30.187]  You see what's happening with our country, how great it is, and how well, how well different groups of people are doing.
[00:39:30.187 --> 00:39:32.389]  I mean, nobody would believe this.
[00:39:32.389 --> 00:39:34.311]  The Democrats are very nervous, I will tell you.
[00:39:34.311 --> 00:39:38.015]  They're very, they're, you know, supposed to be automatic.
[00:39:38.015 --> 00:39:41.498]  They do nothing for you, and that was supposed to be automatic.
[00:39:41.498 --> 00:39:43.781]  Not anymore.
[00:39:43.781 --> 00:39:44.782]  Not anymore, right?
[00:39:45.578 --> 00:39:56.881]  But you're not intimidated by the forces of political correctness because you embrace your own right to free thought and to free speech.
[00:39:56.881 --> 00:40:07.184]  History is fashioned by those like you who step up to the plate and get into the game and get the Grand Slam home run.
[00:40:07.184 --> 00:40:08.604]  I was going to say home run.
[00:40:08.604 --> 00:40:10.505]  Let's go for the Grand Slam home run.
[00:40:12.499 --> 00:40:13.681]  That's what you're doing, man.
[00:40:13.681 --> 00:40:23.274]  That's what you're doing.
[00:40:23.274 --> 00:40:24.136]  I can live with that.
[00:40:26.724 --> 00:40:28.686]  Alright, let's stop right here.
[00:40:28.686 --> 00:40:40.416]  I wanted to actually carry part of the Young Black Leadership Conference today, because I know a lot of people that are there, including one of our reporters, but it got overshadowed, obviously, by the whole pipe bomb.
[00:40:40.416 --> 00:40:41.637]  Sorry, see, I'm doing it myself.
[00:40:41.637 --> 00:40:42.918]  It's not a pipe bomb.
[00:40:42.918 --> 00:40:44.639]  The police commissioner says it's not a pipe bomb.
[00:40:44.639 --> 00:40:45.120]  It's fake.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.241]  There is no powder.
[00:40:46.241 --> 00:40:46.901]  It's not real.
[00:40:46.901 --> 00:40:49.043]  The fake bomb hoax.
[00:40:49.043 --> 00:40:50.945]  The fake bomb hoax.
[00:40:50.945 --> 00:40:51.926]  The fake bomb hoax.
[00:40:53.772 --> 00:40:58.453]  And so when we come back, we're going to get into all that, but this is gigantic breaking news.
[00:40:58.453 --> 00:41:13.976]  Cesar Sayoc, the alleged mail bomber, had Trump stickers all over his vehicle, but on Twitter, he only follows 32 people, many of whom are left-wingers like Lena Dunham, Barack Obama, and Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:41:13.976 --> 00:41:14.856]  That's what I said.
[00:41:14.856 --> 00:41:16.857]  This is what I feared.
[00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:20.951]  And I've said it on air.
[00:41:20.951 --> 00:41:28.352]  If the left gets smart, and they're willing to take one for their evil team, they will start going out and staging events in our name.
[00:41:28.352 --> 00:41:36.374]  But, thanks to the internet, and thanks to things being documented, we know their histories.
[00:41:36.374 --> 00:41:42.015]  Like the four leaders of the alt-right white nationalist bumbos.
[00:41:43.905 --> 00:41:50.190]  And it's like, you didn't even wait five years since you were top leftist leaders working directly for Hillary and Bill?
[00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:59.838]  Some of you wait six months or a year and then you pop up to try to lead this white supremacist army of BS?
[00:41:59.838 --> 00:42:00.599]  We see through you!
[00:42:00.599 --> 00:42:07.004]  And Charlottesville was the first big one when I started puckering a little bit.
[00:42:08.891 --> 00:42:17.658]  So you got a Native American, it's now confirmed Seminole Nation, who was known to them and made threats reportedly in New York protected, and who's a Democrat.
[00:42:17.658 --> 00:42:19.280]  He's a registered Democrat.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:21.742]  That's the breaking news when we come back.
[00:42:21.742 --> 00:42:24.984]  Oh my God.
[00:42:24.984 --> 00:42:32.891]  He is, it says who he is, on his fricking LinkedIn.
[00:42:33.976 --> 00:42:36.658]  God, they wouldn't even get rid of that.
[00:42:36.658 --> 00:42:36.818]  Why?
[00:42:36.818 --> 00:42:37.419]  They don't need to.
[00:42:37.419 --> 00:42:37.959]  Does it matter?
[00:42:37.959 --> 00:42:40.742]  You could have pictures of him kissing Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:40.742 --> 00:42:42.883]  They'd say it was my fault or Trump's fault.
[00:42:42.883 --> 00:42:43.904]  Wow.
[00:42:43.904 --> 00:42:46.006]  This is getting crazy.
[00:42:46.006 --> 00:42:47.627]  This is like minute by minute is insane.
[00:42:47.627 --> 00:42:50.389]  We got a bunch of law enforcement and military callers.
[00:42:50.389 --> 00:42:52.091]  We'll talk to you next segment straight ahead.
[00:42:52.091 --> 00:42:53.232]  But this is crazy.

[00:44:03.614 --> 00:44:07.096]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[00:44:07.096 --> 00:44:08.857]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[00:44:08.857 --> 00:44:12.118]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[00:44:12.118 --> 00:44:18.901]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[00:44:18.901 --> 00:44:23.984]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[00:44:24.324 --> 00:44:30.426]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[00:44:30.426 --> 00:44:33.428]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[00:44:33.428 --> 00:44:34.508]  I want to keep going.
[00:44:34.508 --> 00:44:38.350]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:40.350]  I want to push all the way.
[00:44:40.350 --> 00:44:41.651]  I've committed to do that.
[00:44:41.651 --> 00:44:42.731]  I've prayed for that.
[00:44:42.731 --> 00:44:44.372]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[00:44:44.372 --> 00:44:46.813]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[00:44:47.293 --> 00:44:48.435]  I will never falter.
[00:44:48.435 --> 00:44:50.959]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[00:44:50.959 --> 00:44:51.900]  I physically will.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:58.651]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWarshaw.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.

[00:46:04.947 --> 00:46:07.050]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[00:46:07.050 --> 00:46:13.139]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, and to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[00:46:13.139 --> 00:46:14.060]  Come to their door.
[00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:14.641]  I'm death.
[00:46:14.841 --> 00:46:15.521]  And they know it.
[00:46:15.521 --> 00:46:16.802]  I'm death of their system.
[00:46:16.802 --> 00:46:22.666]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast, we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products.

[00:46:26.569 --> 00:46:33.353]  And it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best selling products and we are hurtling into the hole.
[00:46:33.433 --> 00:46:37.736]  Christmas season, so it's a great time to take advantage of these super sales right now.

[00:46:45.540 --> 00:46:50.003]  You support the broadcast and that lets us stand against the enemy, which infuriates them.
[00:46:50.003 --> 00:46:55.526]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters being huge InfoWars supporters?
[00:46:55.526 --> 00:46:56.606]  It scared them to death.
[00:46:56.606 --> 00:46:59.268]  That's why they want to extinguish us, but you won't let them!
[00:47:03.308 --> 00:47:13.573]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:13.573 --> 00:47:19.156]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:19.156 --> 00:47:20.377]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:32.643 --> 00:47:39.788]  Ladies and gentlemen, to be clear, I don't think we know who Cesar Altier Sayoc is.
[00:47:39.788 --> 00:47:44.231]  It's confirmed that he's part of the Seminole Nation, Native American.
[00:47:44.231 --> 00:47:50.056]  And just like Michael Zimmerman was, I would not say Caucasian, they would whiten his face for the news.
[00:47:50.056 --> 00:47:55.680]  We now later learn, through orders from the Justice Department, to make him look more white.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:48:00.323]  But let's put on screen what the actual police mugshot of him looks like.
[00:48:01.854 --> 00:48:05.798]  But notice they're saying a white male, even though he's a member of the Seminole Nation, all this.
[00:48:05.798 --> 00:48:06.919]  I'm not blaming Native Americans.
[00:48:06.919 --> 00:48:09.140]  I'm not blaming anybody.
[00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.044]  It just shows how they manipulate everything.
[00:48:13.044 --> 00:48:14.305]  It's not real bombs.
[00:48:14.305 --> 00:48:16.447]  There was no explosive in it.
[00:48:16.447 --> 00:48:18.429]  That's the police commissioner of New York.
[00:48:18.429 --> 00:48:19.690]  That's all confirmed.
[00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.552]  So, this was a bombing hoax.
[00:48:22.552 --> 00:48:23.974]  This was done right before the campaign.
[00:48:25.182 --> 00:48:29.304]  You've got his white van that doesn't have a bunch of stickers by themselves on it.
[00:48:29.304 --> 00:48:37.187]  It looks like somebody took a bunch of memes and put it together at a print shop or a graphic shop and then seamlessly do it.
[00:48:37.187 --> 00:48:40.669]  It looks like something directly out of Hollywood.
[00:48:40.669 --> 00:48:41.709]  It looks very, very scripted.
[00:48:41.709 --> 00:48:50.613]  So you have the timing, you have the Democrats pre-programming that they're going to be attacked ahead of the elections and that it's Trump's fault because he's calling for violence against them when he's not.
[00:48:52.239 --> 00:49:01.786]  Now if you go to his Facebook that we're showing, they haven't taken that down yet, and it is all a bunch of pro-Trump stuff.
[00:49:01.786 --> 00:49:05.148]  No Alex Jones stuff, that's interesting.
[00:49:05.148 --> 00:49:08.030]  Do a CTRL-F search Alex Jones on that, guys.
[00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:10.132]  Do a text search, CTRL-F Alex Jones.
[00:49:10.132 --> 00:49:11.173]  Hope I'm not on there.
[00:49:11.173 --> 00:49:12.654]  But the point is, is that Caesar
[00:49:13.886 --> 00:49:17.230]  And it's spelled a little bit different there than what the police have put out.
[00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:21.794]  It's Caesar A-L-T-I-E-R Shayok.
[00:49:21.794 --> 00:49:27.400]  On there, there's an I at the end of it, of the Altier, Altier I or something.
[00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.422]  But the point is, we don't know at this point.
[00:49:29.422 --> 00:49:31.264]  I'm reporting on what's mainstream news.
[00:49:31.264 --> 00:49:35.268]  I'm reporting on what is on, reportedly, his Facebook.
[00:49:35.268 --> 00:49:36.489]  They have blocked his Twitter.
[00:49:37.489 --> 00:49:39.349]  We were able to grab parts of it.
[00:49:39.349 --> 00:49:44.511]  And again, we don't know how accurate this is because this is in the flow of information at the moment.
[00:49:44.511 --> 00:49:49.792]  But Cesar Sayoc, the alleged mail bomber, had Trump stickers all over his vehicle.
[00:49:49.792 --> 00:49:53.393]  But on Twitter, he only follows 32 people.
[00:49:53.393 --> 00:49:58.514]  Many of whom are left-wingers like Lena Dunham, Barack Obama, and Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:49:58.514 --> 00:50:01.195]  And then now they're reporting he's a registered Democrat.
[00:50:02.276 --> 00:50:09.383]  And then again, that links through right there to some of these public database sites that are similar to Wikipedia, where you could edit that in real time.
[00:50:09.383 --> 00:50:11.565]  So we don't know if that's accurate either.
[00:50:11.565 --> 00:50:14.047]  Cesar Sayoc, 56-year-old, was born on 3-17-62.
[00:50:14.047 --> 00:50:14.988]  Currently lives in Florida.
[00:50:19.577 --> 00:50:22.098]  I'm not saying anything you can see on CNN or Fox News is accurate at this point.
[00:50:22.098 --> 00:50:24.658]  We're just reporting on what's being broken down.
[00:50:24.658 --> 00:50:24.918]  But look!
[00:50:45.239 --> 00:51:00.529]  For when they're done with his face, he will be white as the side, you know, of a milk truck and he will probably have a Hitler mustache and Trump forever tattoos all over him.
[00:51:00.529 --> 00:51:07.954]  So, I mean, even this print from the news, it's been whitened compared to the digital mugshot that we can also put on screen for TV viewers.
[00:51:07.954 --> 00:51:13.818]  So look, by the time they're done, the media will go with every angle to make the image of evil in this world a white person.
[00:51:14.418 --> 00:51:16.860]  I'm not the one saying brown people are bad.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:26.168]  I'm saying the media is always trying to hype that it's white people that are evil, and so they will, just inherently because of what color we are, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about.
[00:51:26.168 --> 00:51:34.294]  So, we should get Matt Bracken to pop back in on the show, but I do want to open the phone system up, guys, so I can see who the callers are there.
[00:51:34.294 --> 00:51:43.742]  That would be stupendous, so that I can start going to some of the military and law enforcement callers that have called in to the broadcast today, and we will take your calls.
[00:51:45.114 --> 00:51:57.625]  But again, if you just tuned in, the massive pre-programming that we saw in the last year saying Trump's going to cause violence, Alex Jones is going to cause violence, Trump's calling for killing the media.
[00:51:57.625 --> 00:52:00.208]  Trump says, hey, CNN's lying about me hating Mexicans.
[00:52:00.208 --> 00:52:02.149]  You want to kill the media?
[00:52:02.149 --> 00:52:03.751]  Well, no, I don't.
[00:52:03.751 --> 00:52:04.752]  Well, don't question us.
[00:52:04.752 --> 00:52:05.773]  It causes violence.
[00:52:05.773 --> 00:52:08.775]  So Alex Jones wants to use battle rifles.
[00:52:08.775 --> 00:52:09.956]  He told his listeners to kill us.
[00:52:09.956 --> 00:52:10.877]  It's not true.
[00:52:10.877 --> 00:52:11.418]  There is no video.
[00:52:12.469 --> 00:52:16.270]  So they wouldn't be doing that if they weren't planning to attack themselves.
[00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:28.274]  And now someone with a dubious background, we're told he's a white guy, we're told he sent real bombs, the police say they're not real bombs, they're fake bombs, the media still goes with the fact that they're real bombs.
[00:52:28.274 --> 00:52:31.976]  He'd reportedly been in trouble before for making threats, but there was no indictments.
[00:52:31.976 --> 00:52:33.076]  He was known to law enforcement.
[00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:36.130]  And so, here we go.
[00:52:36.130 --> 00:52:42.851]  I said there would be something like this, bombings or shootings or attempted ones of Democrats ahead of the election.
[00:52:42.851 --> 00:52:45.052]  I guess two weeks out it would start.
[00:52:45.052 --> 00:52:48.833]  This is the October surprise, historically, in late October.
[00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:51.834]  This is when incumbents start wars to stay in.
[00:52:51.834 --> 00:52:53.334]  Trump hasn't done that.
[00:52:53.334 --> 00:52:58.776]  And those that aren't in power stage violent events against themselves.
[00:52:58.776 --> 00:53:02.857]  Half the episodes on House of Cards were that, because everyone knows that goes on.
[00:53:04.798 --> 00:53:14.705]  Then I sit here and point out that all these Democrats have written autobiographies admitting that they would throw bricks through their own windows to get elected to the, you know, City Council.
[00:53:14.705 --> 00:53:19.329]  You throw bricks through your window to get elected to City Council and blame your enemy.
[00:53:19.329 --> 00:53:22.291]  You bomb yourself to get into Congress.
[00:53:22.291 --> 00:53:25.093]  You stage mass shootings to get into the presidency of your Democrat.
[00:53:26.681 --> 00:53:32.205]  But we caught them using their Islamist scripts to blame Trump last year in Vegas.
[00:53:32.205 --> 00:53:34.447]  So that story went away, didn't it?
[00:53:34.447 --> 00:53:36.228]  The multiple shooters, the witnesses.
[00:53:36.228 --> 00:53:48.138]  I was told by the FBI hostage rescue team that they went into the room, that his body was already cold, that there was Islamic paraphernalia and anti-paraphernalia.
[00:53:48.138 --> 00:53:51.040]  They thought he was a gun dealer and a gun deal gone bad.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.041]  All of that came out.
[00:53:53.507 --> 00:54:01.832]  Then I was shown footage out of Florida, and I had to sign an NDAA to even see it, and I can't tell you what was on it.
[00:54:01.832 --> 00:54:04.434]  But let me tell you.
[00:54:04.434 --> 00:54:06.675]  He was a leftist.
[00:54:06.675 --> 00:54:08.477]  He was a gun runner.
[00:54:08.477 --> 00:54:10.738]  He was a spook.
[00:54:10.738 --> 00:54:13.520]  And he went in there when the Saudi Arabians were in town.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:21.245]  He thought for a gun deal, and they used him because they couldn't fly weapons in, for the Saudi Arabian military convention.
[00:54:21.245 --> 00:54:22.906]  10,000 members of the Saudi military were there.
[00:54:24.244 --> 00:54:29.385]  And they had that guy that had sold them weapons before come to the event.
[00:54:29.385 --> 00:54:34.066]  He sold weapons right there in Nevada and in Florida.
[00:54:34.066 --> 00:54:39.227]  That's where Southcom and CENTCOM and all that stuff has different headquarters and bases.
[00:54:39.227 --> 00:54:44.048]  And we don't know exactly what happened, but we know the official story is not true.
[00:54:44.048 --> 00:54:46.649]  And you notice, a year later, you don't hear jack about this.
[00:54:46.649 --> 00:54:47.529]  We're going to start the next hour.
[00:54:48.820 --> 00:54:54.047]  And go right to Kyle, and Steve, and Ken, and Steven, and Phil, and Shane, and Derek, and Joe.
[00:54:54.047 --> 00:54:58.452]  And if any of you guys were on hold yesterday, let me know so I'll go to you first.
[00:54:58.452 --> 00:55:00.956]  I ended the show with about five of you guys on hold.
[00:55:00.956 --> 00:55:03.178]  I apologize, but that was just the end of the show.
[00:55:03.178 --> 00:55:04.180]  So, here's where we are.
[00:55:06.218 --> 00:55:09.641]  It's admitted these weren't real bombs, but the media keeps going and saying they are.
[00:55:09.641 --> 00:55:10.862]  That's huge.
[00:55:10.862 --> 00:55:21.751]  This guy looks like he's out of Central Casting with his white van, with professional plastering all over it, like somebody overdid it from Hollywood, because there's not time to have old stickers and things covered up, and you know, no, no, no.
[00:55:21.751 --> 00:55:28.437]  This has all been done to stick out like a sore thumb, and to be a perfect billboard on the news in the media.
[00:55:28.437 --> 00:55:30.759]  And the timing's perfect, and the pre-programming's perfect.
[00:55:32.765 --> 00:55:34.685]  And so, this stinks to high heaven to me.
[00:55:34.685 --> 00:55:41.286]  We will break it all down in the next hour with your phone calls and more, and we'll look at what this is distracting us from.
[00:55:41.286 --> 00:55:47.448]  The open borders, the caravan, Trump's executive orders, the attempts to plunge the stock market, and everything else.
[00:55:47.448 --> 00:55:50.768]  In fact, where is the Dow Jones right now?
[00:55:50.768 --> 00:56:01.150]  And finally for this hour, they wanted to silence us and try to restrict us on social media and other systems ahead of the last few weeks, so that we couldn't be on air
[00:56:02.383 --> 00:56:06.039]  When all of this incredible information broke loose.
[00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:16.476]  So that we couldn't respond in live time and do what we've done in other events and basically sabotage their PSYOP that they run off these false flags.
[00:56:16.476 --> 00:56:18.598]  And this is a false flag completely.
[00:56:18.598 --> 00:56:21.379]  I mean, there's no doubt that this is staged.
[00:56:21.379 --> 00:56:27.203]  It's like when you see an infomercial, or you see bad actors, you go, that isn't real, that's actors.
[00:56:27.203 --> 00:56:29.385]  You just look at this, it's fake.
[00:56:29.385 --> 00:56:31.466]  Now, do we know the whole story?
[00:56:31.466 --> 00:56:32.387]  No, but it's fake.
[00:56:33.439 --> 00:56:34.981]  It's like biting into a plastic banana.
[00:56:34.981 --> 00:56:38.324]  It's not a real banana, or a plastic orange, or a plastic strawberry.
[00:56:38.324 --> 00:56:39.705]  Do you know the type of plastic it is?
[00:56:39.705 --> 00:56:40.646]  Do you know who made it?
[00:56:40.646 --> 00:56:41.247]  No!
[00:56:41.247 --> 00:56:42.248]  But it's not real!
[00:56:42.248 --> 00:56:48.594]  It's like I see all of the news opening sex brothels with robot dolls.
[00:56:48.594 --> 00:56:49.916]  You're like, how do you know it's a robot?
[00:56:49.916 --> 00:56:53.019]  Well, it looks like one and they say it is.
[00:56:53.019 --> 00:56:55.121]  Well, who made it then if it's not a real woman?
[00:56:55.121 --> 00:56:55.962]  You see?
[00:56:55.962 --> 00:56:57.043]  It's these games they play.

[00:58:55.313 --> 00:58:56.473]  They want to shut it down.

[00:59:39.234 --> 00:59:40.615]  Nobody can get it at that price.
[00:59:40.615 --> 00:59:42.536]  But you are the folks that have stood with us
[00:59:42.936 --> 00:59:47.038]  So it's a 360 win-win at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:59:47.038 --> 00:59:53.280]  Please take action.
[00:59:53.280 --> 00:59:59.302]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:59:59.302 --> 01:00:07.325]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:18.138 --> 01:00:23.189]  Alright, I want to go to part of Paul Watson's report.
[01:00:23.189 --> 01:00:25.453]  Hot bomb rollout doesn't pass the smell test.
[01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:34.923]  There's another report by John Bowne, and I'm going to come back in the next segment and go to your phone calls, law enforcement, military, to give us your expert take on what you're witnessing.
[01:00:34.923 --> 01:00:40.944]  But the president says it's unfortunate that bomb stuff, slowing Republican momentum, going into midterms.
[01:00:40.944 --> 01:00:43.765]  I mean, you have a real riots in being mailed to Republicans.
[01:00:43.765 --> 01:00:44.865]  The media doesn't even cover it.
[01:00:44.865 --> 01:00:46.806]  You've got real Congressmen being shot.
[01:00:46.806 --> 01:00:48.346]  You've got real people having their ribs broken.
[01:00:48.346 --> 01:00:50.326]  You've got real ICE being killed.
[01:00:50.326 --> 01:00:52.467]  You've got real caravans invading.
[01:00:53.430 --> 01:01:11.216]  And then meanwhile, all these globalists get mailed fake bombs, that's the scandal, and now they catch some guy who has a mixed Democrat-Republican background that they say is a white guy and he's not, and he's got like some central casting van with these perfect wraps all over it of pro-Trump stuff.
[01:01:11.216 --> 01:01:12.317]  It's just incredible.
[01:01:12.317 --> 01:01:18.859]  And I see this as a beta test, 14 days out, now 11 days out, to see how America would buy into this.
[01:01:18.859 --> 01:01:21.800]  And so I think if we buy this and we don't expose it's a false flag,
[01:01:23.148 --> 01:01:25.909]  Uh, I think they got the big truck bombs loaded, the mass shooters ready.
[01:01:25.909 --> 01:01:28.390]  So, get ready for phase two, everybody.
[01:01:28.390 --> 01:01:30.471]  Here's part of Paul Watson's report.
[01:01:30.471 --> 01:01:32.712]  All political violence is horrendous.
[01:01:32.712 --> 01:01:40.875]  And unlike some on the left who have either ignored or advocated far-left Antifa violence, I denounce all political violence.
[01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:45.577]  And yes, far-right extremism and far-right violence exists, and it's a problem.
[01:01:45.577 --> 01:01:51.820]  And yes, it could very well turn out to be that the mail bomber is in fact a MAGA bomber, a Trump supporter trying to exact
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:52.220]  We're good.
[01:02:10.857 --> 01:02:12.538]  Everything is a theory.
[01:02:12.538 --> 01:02:14.280]  So here are a few questions.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:21.345]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism that could only have the effect of making Trump look bad?
[01:02:21.345 --> 01:02:30.171]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism that would distract from the migrant caravan, a winning political issue for Trump?
[01:02:30.171 --> 01:02:39.138]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism right off the back of Trump securing a major political victory in securing the nomination of Kavanaugh?
[01:02:39.218 --> 01:02:48.545]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism when polls showed that the race for Congress was starting to narrow in favor of Republicans?
[01:02:48.545 --> 01:02:55.130]  The package sent to former Vice President Joe Biden in Delaware wasn't delivered because of postage due.
[01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:58.653]  Who would go to the trouble and risk of building a mail bomb?
[01:02:59.013 --> 01:03:01.594]  And then forget to add the right postage.
[01:03:01.594 --> 01:03:06.375]  And why did the bomber attach postage to a package that was delivered by a courier?
[01:03:06.375 --> 01:03:12.657]  Why would the mail bomber put what looked like timers on the bombs when he had no idea when they'd be delivered?
[01:03:12.657 --> 01:03:15.818]  Whoever this guy is, I think it's safe to say he's not the brightest.
[01:03:16.298 --> 01:03:18.139]  We'll probably be caught very quickly.
[01:03:18.139 --> 01:03:23.061]  Why were the bombs apparently hoax devices that were never intended to explode?
[01:03:23.061 --> 01:03:29.744]  If the culprit intended to cause harm, why was the powder found inside the package sent to CNN deemed harmless?
[01:03:29.744 --> 01:03:35.787]  Does this suggest that the motive was merely to send a political message and not to harm anyone?
[01:03:35.787 --> 01:03:39.129]  Why were the bombs fitted with a cheap digital display clock?
[01:03:39.249 --> 01:03:44.033]  That doesn't even have an alarm, which would be a necessity to trigger a bomb.
[01:03:44.033 --> 01:03:49.356]  Why is there a joke version of the ISIS flag attached to the device sent to CNN?
[01:03:49.356 --> 01:03:52.519]  Why did the bombs have wires attached to both ends?
[01:03:52.519 --> 01:03:58.863]  According to this former bomb disposal officer, proper pipe bombs don't have wires connected to both ends.
[01:03:58.863 --> 01:03:59.584]  That's dumb.
[01:03:59.764 --> 01:04:06.451]  Why were the timers so big when that's completely unnecessary and why weren't they placed inside the pipe bomb?
[01:04:06.451 --> 01:04:13.559]  Why were these bombs made to look so hokey that even law enforcement officials are now describing them as Hollywood-style hoaxes?
[01:04:13.559 --> 01:04:18.364]  Why was Debbie Wasserman Schultz named on one of the packages as the return address?
[01:04:18.364 --> 01:04:21.748]  Does this suggest the bomber may in fact be a progressive?
[01:04:22.228 --> 01:04:25.250]  Angered at the DNC's treatment of Bernie Sanders.
[01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:36.195]  If the media really cares about condemning political violence, why have they spent the past two years either ignoring or tacitly endorsing Antifa-led political violence?
[01:04:36.195 --> 01:04:39.317]  If the media cares about condemning political violence,
[01:04:39.517 --> 01:04:44.878]  Why did they all but ignore the bomb threats against Trump and the riots sent to Don Jr.
[01:04:44.878 --> 01:04:45.799]  and the Pentagon?
[01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:55.281]  If the New York Times really cares about toning down the rhetoric, why did they just publish a short story depicting the assassination of President Trump?
[01:04:55.281 --> 01:04:57.542]  We'll be back with your phone calls in T-minus 60.
[01:04:58.502 --> 01:05:02.743]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[01:05:02.743 --> 01:05:06.225]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[01:05:06.225 --> 01:05:07.985]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[01:05:07.985 --> 01:05:11.246]  They know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed our products.
[01:05:11.246 --> 01:05:18.028]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[01:05:18.028 --> 01:05:23.130]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:29.575]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[01:05:29.575 --> 01:05:32.558]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[01:05:32.558 --> 01:05:33.639]  I want to keep going.
[01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:37.482]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[01:05:37.482 --> 01:05:39.503]  I want to push all the way.
[01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:40.785]  I've committed to do that.
[01:05:40.785 --> 01:05:41.865]  I've prayed for that.
[01:05:41.865 --> 01:05:43.507]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:45.929]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[01:05:46.429 --> 01:05:47.551]  I will never falter.
[01:05:47.551 --> 01:05:50.094]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[01:05:50.094 --> 01:05:51.035]  I physically will.
[01:05:51.035 --> 01:05:57.784]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, then 4Wars4.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:06:03.277 --> 01:06:05.019]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:05.019 --> 01:06:16.228]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.228 --> 01:06:29.739]  Trump mulls executive order to block all migrants at the border and just stop letting them come in and claim amnesty or claim that they are refugees from political or religious oppression if they don't do it the official proper way.
[01:06:30.259 --> 01:06:42.963]  And that's the way to just end the flood and the fact that the border has already been collapsed with the giant illegal alien invasion openly run by the UN, marching towards the United States.
[01:06:42.963 --> 01:06:47.985]  Other news at Infowars.com is so incredibly critical right now.
[01:06:47.985 --> 01:06:56.027]  We have a man arrested for bomb package campaign, but it's a fake bomb, the New York police and FBI say.
[01:06:56.027 --> 01:06:57.808]  They say there's no real powder in it.
[01:06:58.308 --> 01:07:02.532]  Former Secret Service agent says identity of mail bomber is going to surprise people.
[01:07:02.532 --> 01:07:13.122]  Well, now we know it's a supposed Trump supporter, but all we know is that there are Trump stickers all over the vehicle right out of central casting.
[01:07:13.122 --> 01:07:19.969]  And even CNN analysts have had to admit that the false flag theory is one that holds water and has to be looked at.
[01:07:20.469 --> 01:07:32.432]  There's also new video of Hillary next to Donna Shalala, two ringwraith witches, looking like she's about to die having another coughing fit on her birthday, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:32.432 --> 01:07:37.613]  So coming up, CNN analyst admits false flag mail bomb theory is possible.
[01:07:37.613 --> 01:07:43.235]  Here's the deal, and I'm going to your calls right now.
[01:07:43.235 --> 01:07:44.535]  You have all the pre-programming.
[01:07:47.708 --> 01:07:57.077]  That's gone on saying that Trump and Republicans are going to cause violence against the media, and then they lie and say that Trump is calling for violence on the media when he's not.
[01:07:57.077 --> 01:07:59.058]  And they say I'm calling for violence when we're not.
[01:07:59.058 --> 01:08:00.920]  They're saying it's imminent, it's coming.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:06.105]  And then it starts, when they're the ones really pushing violence, hoping we get violent back, trying to pick a fight.
[01:08:07.486 --> 01:08:10.788]  And then magically, some guy who's got a year and a half of M.O.
[01:08:10.788 --> 01:08:18.391]  being a Trump supporter, but his Twitter is Democrat-supporting, and he's got different aliases and different names, but it's him on the Twitter and him on the Facebook.
[01:08:18.391 --> 01:08:21.893]  It's like there's two different identities.
[01:08:21.893 --> 01:08:25.455]  When you see stuff like that, it is very, very, very suspicious.
[01:08:25.455 --> 01:08:35.300]  One name is Cesar Al-Ta'ari Rondazzo, and then he has this other name,
[01:08:37.506 --> 01:08:43.348]  That's different that they're saying is his official name.
[01:08:43.348 --> 01:08:44.388]  So what do you think about that?
[01:08:44.388 --> 01:08:55.231]  He is Cesar Altari Rondazzo and it's him on Facebook and all these videos at Trump rallies.
[01:08:55.231 --> 01:09:02.693]  And then his official name released by the police is Cesar Altair Sayoc.
[01:09:02.693 --> 01:09:05.074]  So it gets weirder and weirder.
[01:09:05.074 --> 01:09:05.474]  Meanwhile,
[01:09:07.694 --> 01:09:12.796]  Pipe bomb and powder delivered to CNN were harmless.
[01:09:12.796 --> 01:09:14.697]  But you're not seeing that in a lot of news.
[01:09:14.697 --> 01:09:18.738]  Trump, unfortunate that bomb stuff slowing Republican momentum going into midterms.
[01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.359]  Yeah, unfortunate.
[01:09:20.359 --> 01:09:21.059]  In a 3 a.m.
[01:09:21.059 --> 01:09:23.700]  tweet, Trump claims he's being blamed for mail bombs.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:27.241]  Boston Globe basically attacks Trump like he's crazy.
[01:09:27.241 --> 01:09:28.942]  They're all over the news, Chang.
[01:09:28.942 --> 01:09:31.263]  It's Trump's fault.
[01:09:31.263 --> 01:09:33.103]  George Soros' son wrote an op-ed.
[01:09:33.103 --> 01:09:34.384]  I mean, that's what I love.
[01:09:34.384 --> 01:09:37.005]  Trump can say the sky's blue and they say he's lying.
[01:09:38.527 --> 01:09:40.769]  I'm taking your calls now.
[01:09:40.769 --> 01:09:53.959]  Because law enforcement and military, people that have worked in EOD, but now it's expanded into larger detective skill set, really give us a lot of interesting perspective into what's really going on here.
[01:09:53.959 --> 01:10:03.107]  So we're going to go to Kyle, we're going to go to Eb, we're going to go to Kevin, we're going to go to Steve, we're going to go to Ken, we're going to go to Vox, we're going to go to Phil, Shane, Joe, and others.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.241]  Who should we go to first?
[01:10:06.241 --> 01:10:11.045]  We haven't talked to anybody from the Israeli Defense Force, Border Security Explosives, yet.
[01:10:11.045 --> 01:10:13.007]  So let's talk to Phil in Illinois.
[01:10:13.007 --> 01:10:15.188]  Thanks for calling in on the air.
[01:10:15.188 --> 01:10:17.610]  Hey, Shalom Aleichem.
[01:10:17.610 --> 01:10:20.533]  I wanted to bring up a couple of points.
[01:10:20.533 --> 01:10:22.174]  I saw the x-ray of the device.
[01:10:22.174 --> 01:10:23.695]  I saw no capacitors.
[01:10:23.695 --> 01:10:24.816]  I saw no circuit board.
[01:10:24.816 --> 01:10:28.219]  So I know for a fact there was no triggering circuit.
[01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:33.976]  And so it's fake, it's a $3 bill.
[01:10:33.976 --> 01:10:39.140]  So it's fake, which law enforcement's already saying, but it's not getting any attention.
[01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:44.765]  You know, the fact is, the fact of it, okay, on top of that, they reported Rison being sent.
[01:10:44.765 --> 01:10:48.007]  What happened with that story?
[01:10:48.007 --> 01:10:56.474]  Well, they're acting like it's the end of the world and the biggest story ever, and it's all built on the hoax that these are real bombs.
[01:10:56.474 --> 01:10:57.875]  And they're not real bombs.
[01:10:57.875 --> 01:10:58.796]  They were designed to blow.
[01:10:59.611 --> 01:11:01.792]  That's my point.
[01:11:01.792 --> 01:11:03.193]  They were designed to instill fear.
[01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:06.996]  It's not like a suicide or a genuine pipe bomb.
[01:11:06.996 --> 01:11:12.299]  And the fact of the matter is, it's hokey pokey because there's no real postmarks on them.
[01:11:12.299 --> 01:11:15.821]  You know, and usually there's a chain of custody from the time you drop it off.
[01:11:15.821 --> 01:11:17.462]  You show ID at the post office.
[01:11:19.266 --> 01:11:24.251]  What do you think about the pre-programming of the media saying Trump's calling for violence when he's not?
[01:11:24.251 --> 01:11:25.272]  Oh, we're going to get killed?
[01:11:25.272 --> 01:11:29.075]  I mean, to me, the pre-programming, that's what really makes this so suspect.
[01:11:29.075 --> 01:11:30.617]  And then the timing.
[01:11:30.617 --> 01:11:34.901]  And the American people have such small-term, short-term memories.
[01:11:34.901 --> 01:11:35.982]  That's the point.
[01:11:35.982 --> 01:11:39.105]  They don't remember 9-11 and Stephen Hadfield.
[01:11:39.105 --> 01:11:42.108]  Right after 9-11, we had the anthrax scares.
[01:11:42.108 --> 01:11:43.369]  And that was genuine anthrax.
[01:11:44.693 --> 01:11:48.896]  And this is genuine Ryerson, but this isn't genuine.
[01:11:48.896 --> 01:11:51.938]  Which, again, the whole thing's based on a fraud.
[01:11:51.938 --> 01:11:54.519]  The van looks like it's out of central casting.
[01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:55.300]  None of it adds up.
[01:11:55.300 --> 01:11:56.481]  They're calling him a white guy.
[01:11:56.481 --> 01:11:56.941]  He's not.
[01:11:56.941 --> 01:11:58.402]  This is crazy.
[01:11:58.402 --> 01:11:59.803]  Thank you so much, Phil.
[01:11:59.803 --> 01:12:02.384]  Okay, Kyle from Pennsylvania says Army.
[01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.386]  Says bomb suspect, something not adding up.
[01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:07.688]  Thanks for calling, Kyle, from Pennsylvania.
[01:12:07.688 --> 01:12:08.869]  Hey, Alex, it's a pleasure.
[01:12:08.869 --> 01:12:13.992]  This looks to me, the guy looks to me not as a Trump supporter, but as somebody
[01:12:14.525 --> 01:12:18.287]  Trying to intimidate or, you know, imitate a Trump supporter.
[01:12:18.287 --> 01:12:26.410]  It would be like if I knew nothing of Star Wars, but I went out and got a truck with, you know, a lightsaber and Darth Vader.
[01:12:26.410 --> 01:12:27.150]  Well, that's it.
[01:12:27.150 --> 01:12:31.652]  I mean, the truck, if you're a real Star Wars fan, it's going to look old.
[01:12:31.652 --> 01:12:33.313]  There's going to be some new, some old.
[01:12:33.313 --> 01:12:36.774]  This is brand new, central casting, perfectly wrapped.
[01:12:36.774 --> 01:12:38.455]  Looks like it's never even been rained on.
[01:12:39.537 --> 01:12:48.523]  Well, I guarantee you that if he's been to Trump events in the past, he's some sort of asset where that fan can be seen.
[01:12:49.219 --> 01:12:49.940]  On TV.
[01:12:49.940 --> 01:12:51.441]  Look at what these people represent.
[01:12:51.441 --> 01:12:53.522]  This is horrible.
[01:12:53.522 --> 01:12:54.143]  No, I agree.
[01:12:54.143 --> 01:13:00.847]  He's some type of deep state plant MS-13 operative, who we know the Democrats are working on MS-13, and they're willing to take one for the team.
[01:13:00.847 --> 01:13:06.191]  He's got all these different identities, and that's what my crew was calling him, is the long con.
[01:13:06.191 --> 01:13:08.133]  Because he's got two different identities we know of.
[01:13:08.133 --> 01:13:09.714]  One's liberal, one's conservative.
[01:13:09.714 --> 01:13:11.815]  One's on Twitter, one's on Facebook.
[01:13:11.815 --> 01:13:14.217]  And then, this just all comes out of central casting.
[01:13:15.236 --> 01:13:24.281]  And I think the fact that this has broken, literally, Friday at noon, it shows signs of a failed attempt at propaganda.
[01:13:24.281 --> 01:13:29.805]  Because I could see this being something that was supposed to be like the DC sniper.
[01:13:29.805 --> 01:13:35.108]  13 days of fear, 14 days, and they released it, and people weren't buying it.
[01:13:35.108 --> 01:13:42.072]  No, I agree, they could have wound it up to like a day before the election and it's a Trump guy, but instead they put it out on a Friday when they can flush it.
[01:13:43.154 --> 01:13:44.155]  Yeah, don't go to the polls.
[01:13:44.155 --> 01:13:46.677]  There could be bombs and just people didn't buy it.
[01:13:46.677 --> 01:13:49.138]  People said, this doesn't make sense.
[01:13:49.138 --> 01:13:50.479]  This looks to me like nothing.
[01:13:50.479 --> 01:13:52.140]  And so they just had to dump it.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.683]  I think you'll be able to tell a lot by Monday or Tuesday morning.
[01:13:55.683 --> 01:14:02.288]  If this is still on front pages, if this is still news, then hey, it might just be a gift to the Democrats.
[01:14:02.288 --> 01:14:08.332]  But if it goes away as quickly as it came, you know for a fact that they don't want a hard look at this guy.
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.202]  Man, that's why I love taking calls from military and police.
[01:14:12.202 --> 01:14:13.443]  You guys are really smart.
[01:14:13.443 --> 01:14:15.704]  And that's exactly what I'm seeing here.
[01:14:15.704 --> 01:14:17.406]  And I'm not just seeing what I want to see.
[01:14:17.406 --> 01:14:19.607]  How obvious is this?
[01:14:19.607 --> 01:14:23.410]  That they hype up that we're going to do violence against them when they're the ones doing violence.
[01:14:23.410 --> 01:14:27.213]  They're losing their butt with the immigrant caravan and all this.
[01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:35.499]  And now, right on time, here comes this central casting gleaming van with brand new wraps on it and all of this.
[01:14:35.499 --> 01:14:37.401]  It's just, it's so fake!
[01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:51.438]  I would go back and look at the 2016 election, and let's see if this guy isn't showing up at some of these events where provocateurs were sent in that we know were there from the leaked emails.
[01:14:51.438 --> 01:14:57.061]  I wouldn't be surprised if this guy had a few tussles under his belt back in 2016.
[01:14:59.352 --> 01:15:03.856]  Somebody who's been used for a long amount of time with the opposition.
[01:15:03.856 --> 01:15:05.997]  Absolutely, and now they're flushing him down the commode.
[01:15:05.997 --> 01:15:07.539]  I mean, who knows?
[01:15:07.539 --> 01:15:08.560]  Who knows what's going to happen?
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.580]  All I know is it's fake.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.442]  Any other observations?
[01:15:11.442 --> 01:15:12.823]  This is the Hail Mary.
[01:15:12.823 --> 01:15:21.410]  If this doesn't get them what they need for bad visuals and propaganda against Trump, then nothing will.
[01:15:21.410 --> 01:15:23.612]  But if it does turn out to be legit,
[01:15:24.252 --> 01:15:27.455]  And then this guy is just some knucklehead Trump supporter.
[01:15:27.455 --> 01:15:31.660]  Obviously he's not the standard bearer for Trump supporters.
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.782]  And he's not going to have a gleaming white vehicle.
[01:15:33.782 --> 01:15:36.545]  He makes all these mistakes with the bombs where it's so obvious to get caught.
[01:15:36.545 --> 01:15:39.187]  Then his gleaming perfect white vehicle right on time.
[01:15:39.187 --> 01:15:42.891]  And then again, what real Trump supporter would make Hillary and
[01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.814]  Soros, sympathetic characters.
[01:15:45.814 --> 01:15:51.097]  This is the worst thing a Trump supporter would do and it walks right into all their prescripting.
[01:15:51.097 --> 01:15:52.698]  No, it's fake!
[01:15:52.698 --> 01:15:53.519]  It's a Hail Mary.
[01:15:53.519 --> 01:15:54.499]  Great points, Kyle.
[01:15:54.499 --> 01:15:55.120]  Wow!
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.341]  More great calls straight ahead.
[01:15:57.785 --> 01:15:58.985]  Hear that?
[01:15:58.985 --> 01:16:04.367]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[01:16:04.367 --> 01:16:07.269]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.269 --> 01:16:10.850]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.850 --> 01:16:18.413]  Go to Faketv.com and discover a device that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV, even when you're miles away.
[01:16:18.413 --> 01:16:23.014]  Security is a mindset, and Faketv should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:23.014 --> 01:16:25.455]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:16:25.455 --> 01:16:25.876]  Faketv.com
[01:16:27.341 --> 01:16:33.683]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.683 --> 01:16:36.744]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.744 --> 01:16:42.646]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.646 --> 01:16:46.447]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.447 --> 01:16:47.707]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.707 --> 01:16:49.048]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:49.048 --> 01:16:55.249]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[01:16:55.249 --> 01:16:56.690]  Available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.430 --> 01:17:02.212]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[01:17:02.212 --> 01:17:08.093]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[01:17:08.093 --> 01:17:14.595]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:14.595 --> 01:17:18.656]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.

[01:17:53.479 --> 01:17:56.642]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jeans Company.
[01:17:58.151 --> 01:18:00.830]  They now know that InfoWars has the spirit!
[01:18:02.322 --> 01:18:03.463]  To relaunch it all!
[01:18:03.463 --> 01:18:05.564]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[01:18:05.564 --> 01:18:11.668]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[01:18:11.668 --> 01:18:12.568]  Come to their door.
[01:18:12.568 --> 01:18:14.069]  I'm death, and they know it.
[01:18:14.069 --> 01:18:15.350]  I'm death of their system.
[01:18:15.350 --> 01:18:30.799]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast, we'll be shut down, and we make it easy with the very best products, and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history, and it has got to end in the next few days, because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products, and we are hurting.
[01:18:30.879 --> 01:18:31.540]  We're good to go.
[01:18:58.396 --> 01:19:02.319]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:19:03.658 --> 01:19:11.721]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:19:11.721 --> 01:19:14.322]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:19:14.322 --> 01:19:17.763]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:19:17.763 --> 01:19:20.384]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:19:20.384 --> 01:19:22.685]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:19:22.685 --> 01:19:29.628]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[01:19:30.168 --> 01:19:39.972]  And if you financially support us, if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:19:39.972 --> 01:19:41.152]  We'll win.
[01:19:41.152 --> 01:19:43.973]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[01:19:43.973 --> 01:19:49.375]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[01:19:49.375 --> 01:19:51.216]  And you're right, to the market.
[01:19:51.216 --> 01:19:54.897]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:19:54.897 --> 01:19:56.457]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[01:19:56.457 --> 01:19:57.318]  We need your support.
[01:19:57.318 --> 01:19:57.878]  I'm counting on you.
[01:20:01.290 --> 01:20:03.951]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:34.150 --> 01:20:42.576]  Well, we're taking amazing phone calls from law enforcement and current and former military, and we're gonna have Dr. Steve Pachinik pop back in.
[01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:46.358]  We're gonna get Matt Bracken to pop back in, but I'm not gonna keep them too long.
[01:20:46.358 --> 01:20:50.081]  I'm gonna skip their quick comments and get back to calls, because your calls are amazing.
[01:20:50.081 --> 01:20:54.223]  They're bringing up so many points, a lot of which I thought about but not articulated.
[01:20:54.223 --> 01:20:58.626]  That's why this is so crazy, is you look at something and you say, well, how do you know it's fake?
[01:20:58.626 --> 01:21:00.328]  It's like, where do you start?
[01:21:00.328 --> 01:21:03.029]  You don't know exactly what's going on, but none of it adds up.
[01:21:03.029 --> 01:21:03.750]  It's ridiculous.
[01:21:05.111 --> 01:21:08.033]  And why would a Trump supporter bomb and do this?
[01:21:08.033 --> 01:21:09.193]  And that it's not real bombs.
[01:21:09.193 --> 01:21:14.096]  And then they're all pre-programming that it's coming and it's imminent and when it comes it's our fault.
[01:21:14.096 --> 01:21:19.360]  And they're of course blaming Rush Limbaugh and Matt Drudge and myself and President Trump.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.963]  And there's no talk of Scalise, no talk of Rand Paul, no talk of the ICE people getting killed, no talk of cops that are murdered.
[01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:29.006]  You know, five cops get shot, there's hardly any coverage by Black Lives Matter.
[01:21:30.393 --> 01:21:36.955]  And then this, nobody gets hurt, it's fake bombs, it's like the end of the world and the Democrats are going to win now?
[01:21:36.955 --> 01:21:39.296]  It's ridiculous!
[01:21:39.296 --> 01:21:42.056]  It's ridiculous!
[01:21:42.056 --> 01:21:44.397]  It's like you've got suicide bombings every day.
[01:21:44.397 --> 01:21:45.918]  Sometimes 500, 1,000 dead.
[01:21:45.918 --> 01:21:49.279]  Usually it's a couple dozen dead a day in the Middle East.
[01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:51.439]  There's just bombings everywhere.
[01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:54.940]  Sometimes on Ramadan starts, they all go crazy and it's a couple thousand dead.
[01:21:54.940 --> 01:21:56.881]  There's been thousands dead one day before.
[01:21:57.708 --> 01:21:59.209]  Little blip in the news.
[01:21:59.209 --> 01:22:05.771]  This Khashoggi guy, because he's obviously intelligence on the left, and that's come out, he gets killed, it's like the end of the world.
[01:22:05.771 --> 01:22:08.011]  And I'm not saying it's a good thing.
[01:22:08.011 --> 01:22:11.533]  But it's all done for PR reasons.
[01:22:11.533 --> 01:22:13.033]  And you know when it's PR.
[01:22:13.033 --> 01:22:24.177]  Fourteen days out, all the people under major heat, the caravan exposing their invasion plan, polls showing major red wave surge that could get us over the blue seawall,
[01:22:25.925 --> 01:22:27.730]  And boom, this hits.
[01:22:27.730 --> 01:22:31.198]  And now, notice that it's brand new stickers.
[01:22:31.198 --> 01:22:33.484]  It's not bleached out in the Florida sun.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:39.323]  It looks like a brand new Ferrari in the showroom.
[01:22:39.323 --> 01:22:43.907]  I mean, it's a brand new white van, brand new wraps, all perfectly done.
[01:22:43.907 --> 01:22:47.369]  All clean so the cameras can pick it all up and see what it is.
[01:22:47.369 --> 01:22:49.631]  It's like this Easter egg of disinfo.
[01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:57.757]  With all the crosshairs on Hillary, crosshairs on Michael Moran, you know, crosshairs on Van Jones, making all the real enemies of America victims.
[01:22:57.757 --> 01:22:58.998]  And crosshairs on Soros.
[01:23:00.439 --> 01:23:09.884]  Just like his son says, just like the op-eds say, it's all flawlessly coming together right before the midterms.
[01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:15.287]  That's like when I saw Hillary Clinton town hall event.
[01:23:15.287 --> 01:23:24.432]  And I was walking by my house one night back in 2016, about a month before the election, I went, God, that's not even 35 millimeter.
[01:23:24.432 --> 01:23:26.854]  That's 80 millimeter digital equivalent.
[01:23:26.854 --> 01:23:27.214]  I was like,
[01:23:28.246 --> 01:23:29.626]  It looked so perfect.
[01:23:29.626 --> 01:23:31.847]  You see like dust in the air.
[01:23:31.847 --> 01:23:33.467]  And they said it was a live event.
[01:23:33.467 --> 01:23:34.687]  And the cuts were so perfect.
[01:23:34.687 --> 01:23:35.588]  And the flashbulbs.
[01:23:35.588 --> 01:23:39.348]  And I was like, Stanley Kubrick couldn't make something this good.
[01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:41.329]  It's obviously fake!
[01:23:41.329 --> 01:23:44.149]  And I said, that's fake!
[01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:52.291]  After the election it came out that that exact town hall had been shot months before with actors.
[01:23:54.369 --> 01:24:04.119]  And that they brought in major directors and that there was some huge, I don't know, it was like a $10 million budget, if memory serves, for a $10 million budget.
[01:24:04.119 --> 01:24:07.782]  So you know when you see slick.
[01:24:07.782 --> 01:24:09.724]  You know when you see real.
[01:24:09.724 --> 01:24:15.170]  And you've got this perfect vehicle with perfect wraps, none of it's damaged in the Florida sun.
[01:24:15.170 --> 01:24:17.893]  Let me tell you, you park in the Florida sun a wrap like that,
[01:24:18.817 --> 01:24:21.099]  For a day, it's going to have bubbles.
[01:24:21.099 --> 01:24:22.200]  It's not going to look like that.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:25.542]  This was in a warehouse, waiting.
[01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:33.348]  Oh, try in South Florida, Liberalville, not the panhandle that's conservative, you try parking that outside.
[01:24:33.348 --> 01:24:34.830]  Let me tell you something.
[01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:40.114]  I didn't make a big deal about this, but in 2016, I had a Trump sticker on my car, and a Hillary for President.
[01:24:40.114 --> 01:24:41.295]  Guess what happened to my car?
[01:24:41.295 --> 01:24:42.456]  Not once, but twice.
[01:24:42.456 --> 01:24:47.820]  I had my tires knifed, and then I had a window knocked out and keyed.
[01:24:49.076 --> 01:24:59.882]  How the hell was that driving around in South Florida, the equivalent of Austin, Texas, and not being attacked?
[01:24:59.882 --> 01:25:06.806]  You know, I thought, because I don't go to leftist areas, that I could go to the grocery store, you know, go to the, you know, whatever and not, no, no, no.
[01:25:06.806 --> 01:25:10.869]  I barely drove around for two weeks and had to take the sticker off, which I didn't like doing.
[01:25:14.358 --> 01:25:15.358]  Alright, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:25:15.358 --> 01:25:15.599]  I apologize.
[01:25:15.599 --> 01:25:16.999]  Your calls are amazing.
[01:25:16.999 --> 01:25:20.761]  So I'm going to just as fast as I can, because all these callers, those last two were amazing.
[01:25:20.761 --> 01:25:23.662]  We're just going to go to everybody when we come back, because this is only three minutes to break.
[01:25:23.662 --> 01:25:26.564]  And when we come back, I'm going to go directly to you.
[01:25:26.564 --> 01:25:31.266]  It's just, this is insane.
[01:25:31.266 --> 01:25:33.727]  Again, why would a Trump supporter do something like this?
[01:25:35.768 --> 01:25:39.591]  And of course, they're not gonna cook up some real truck with a bunch of old stickers on it.
[01:25:39.591 --> 01:25:40.492]  Some new, some old.
[01:25:40.492 --> 01:25:44.695]  Everybody knows the right-winger vehicles that you see with a hundred bumper stickers on them.
[01:25:44.695 --> 01:25:46.437]  Some of them look like they're, you know, old.
[01:25:46.437 --> 01:25:51.481]  Some are brand new.
[01:25:51.481 --> 01:25:55.204]  Yeah, remember the guy had a couple Trump stickers and his truck just got torched.
[01:25:55.204 --> 01:25:56.085]  Are you kidding, folks?
[01:25:57.580 --> 01:26:07.064]  If you put stickers in years past against Save Our Springs, that's the environmental group that steals all the land for developers, they'll slash your tires so quick it'll make your head spin.
[01:26:07.064 --> 01:26:12.367]  So again, they will burn your vehicle up if you've got two stickers on your car.
[01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:14.388]  They will smash the windows out.
[01:26:14.388 --> 01:26:18.590]  How in the world in South Florida was this guy driving around?
[01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:21.311]  We're gonna go to break and come back.
[01:26:21.311 --> 01:26:23.292]  And I'm telling you, just as big as Dallas.
[01:26:25.267 --> 01:26:38.093]  This is a test, like I said on Monday, to see if we buy into it and if it hurts Republicans and Poles, which it's doing, for real, it's so ridiculous, then they may do the big one.
[01:26:38.093 --> 01:26:39.253]  Truck bomb.
[01:26:39.253 --> 01:26:39.934]  Or mass shooting.
[01:26:39.934 --> 01:26:41.874]  So just get ready.
[01:26:41.874 --> 01:26:51.619]  And the left's gotten smart enough to find operatives they've got, informants, patsies, you name it, who are willing and ready to go to prison to bring down this country.
[01:26:52.543 --> 01:26:55.624]  And they finally got, like the Muslims have suicide bombers.
[01:26:55.624 --> 01:26:56.205]  It's the equivalent.
[01:26:56.205 --> 01:27:05.909]  They're political bombers who are willing to do false flags and even take the blame to burn us!
[01:27:05.909 --> 01:27:12.691]  What conservative in the universe would send pipe bombs to Hillary Clinton?
[01:27:12.691 --> 01:27:16.433]  And let me tell you, if they were going to do it, they wouldn't send fake ones.
[01:27:16.433 --> 01:27:17.814]  That's not how conservatives operate.
[01:27:17.814 --> 01:27:18.294]  We're going to break.
[01:27:19.306 --> 01:27:20.507]  I don't want any violence.
[01:27:20.507 --> 01:27:24.088]  I hope Hillary can, you know, live a long life to end up going to federal prison.
[01:27:24.088 --> 01:27:25.229]  Lock her up.
[01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:27.150]  Remember, free shipping store-wide.
[01:27:27.150 --> 01:27:29.011]  Biggest sale ever on the supplements.
[01:27:29.011 --> 01:27:30.051]  50% off.
[01:27:30.051 --> 01:27:30.492]  50% off.
[01:27:30.492 --> 01:27:31.432]  Free shipping store-wide.
[01:27:31.432 --> 01:27:31.992]  35% off.

[01:27:33.913 --> 01:27:36.795]  For the great folks at My Patriot Supply, you cannot beat these deals.
[01:27:36.795 --> 01:27:37.715]  Ending soon.
[01:27:37.715 --> 01:27:38.356]  Free shipping.
[01:27:38.356 --> 01:27:38.956]  Mega sale.
[01:27:38.956 --> 01:27:39.656]  Christmas.
[01:27:39.656 --> 01:27:40.777]  Black Friday.
[01:27:40.777 --> 01:27:41.437]  Cyber Monday.
[01:27:41.437 --> 01:27:48.781]  All rolled into one because they took five of our payment processors and we got down to one.
[01:27:50.253 --> 01:27:54.317]  And then we got two more and got contracts that they won't go under political correctness.
[01:27:54.317 --> 01:28:00.363]  And I don't want to say we're even safe at this point, but this is the harassment and the racketeering and the economic terrorism we're under.
[01:28:00.363 --> 01:28:02.906]  But these mega sales, we've already sold out.
[01:28:02.906 --> 01:28:06.710]  We had stuff budgeted at the end of the year to be able to sell what we have by the end of the year.
[01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:08.292]  So I just did most of our sales already.
[01:28:09.753 --> 01:28:12.915]  And I have to end them because we're about to sell out an X2 that is the final run.
[01:28:12.915 --> 01:28:15.838]  We're about to sell out of Boddy's Ultimate Tumor Reformant.
[01:28:15.838 --> 01:28:17.479]  We're about to sell out of MycoZX.
[01:28:17.479 --> 01:28:19.000]  We're about to sell out of the Toothpaste.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:23.403]  Fluoride-free, coiled silver, iodine-fortified, super blue.
[01:28:23.403 --> 01:28:28.106]  We're about to sell out a BrainForce Plus with 20% more each bottle of the Amazing Nootropic.
[01:28:28.106 --> 01:28:30.488]  Leading competitors are twice as much at regular price.
[01:28:30.488 --> 01:28:30.668]  50% off.
[01:28:30.668 --> 01:28:32.330]  You cannot beat BrainForce at this deal.
[01:28:33.587 --> 01:28:39.172]  So, you can also call 888-253-3139 and your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:28:39.172 --> 01:28:41.354]  So thank you for standing with us through these storms.

[01:29:58.188 --> 01:30:03.495]  They now know that InfoWars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[01:30:03.495 --> 01:30:05.598]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.

[01:30:11.706 --> 01:30:12.607]  Come to their door.
[01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:13.148]  I'm death.
[01:30:13.488 --> 01:30:13.689]  Yes, sir.
[01:30:30.930 --> 01:30:31.571]  We're good to go.
[01:30:58.274 --> 01:31:00.975]  Stress is a natural part of life.

[01:31:26.223 --> 01:31:26.563]  I think so.
[01:31:58.105 --> 01:32:06.492]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[01:32:06.492 --> 01:32:07.954]  Believe me, I know.
[01:32:07.954 --> 01:32:12.658]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[01:32:12.658 --> 01:32:15.741]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com,
[01:32:16.201 --> 01:32:17.883]  I still have that energy.
[01:32:17.883 --> 01:32:38.042]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[01:33:00.850 --> 01:33:03.491]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.334 --> 01:33:15.375]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:15.375 --> 01:33:19.096]  It's Friday, October 26, 2018.
[01:33:19.096 --> 01:33:20.837]  11 days.
[01:33:20.837 --> 01:33:23.457]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:23.457 --> 01:33:26.639]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.639 --> 01:33:27.999]  I just talked to Roger Stone.
[01:33:27.999 --> 01:33:28.939]  I'm gonna get him to pop in.
[01:33:28.939 --> 01:33:30.380]  He's an expert on Florida politics.
[01:33:33.909 --> 01:33:37.391]  He says MSNBC's trying to tie Arrested Bomber to Infowars.
[01:33:37.391 --> 01:33:39.071]  He's just now watching.
[01:33:39.071 --> 01:33:48.135]  Man arrested, worked for Seminole Indian Tribe of Florida, casino owners and multi-million dollar funders of Democratic Party operatives.
[01:33:48.135 --> 01:33:49.556]  Yeah.
[01:33:49.556 --> 01:33:52.297]  And then, man, the magic van, all perfect and clean.
[01:33:52.297 --> 01:33:53.398]  The big nice wrap.
[01:33:53.398 --> 01:33:54.318]  Looks like it's brand new.
[01:33:54.318 --> 01:33:59.040]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.361]  Alright, Eagle Eye.
[01:34:01.361 --> 01:34:02.682]  Kevin.
[01:34:02.682 --> 01:34:03.022]  Steven.
[01:34:04.377 --> 01:34:05.858]  Oh, there's so many.
[01:34:05.858 --> 01:34:06.518]  Red callers here.
[01:34:06.518 --> 01:34:12.081]  Daniel, Ken, Aaron, Vox, Jack, Shane.
[01:34:12.081 --> 01:34:15.223]  Let's just go from who's been holding the longest through the next person.
[01:34:15.223 --> 01:34:19.065]  Try to move here quickly, because you know I can babble.
[01:34:19.065 --> 01:34:21.906]  Let's talk to Shane in Florida.
[01:34:21.906 --> 01:34:24.708]  EOD, Ordinance Disposal.
[01:34:24.708 --> 01:34:26.769]  Shane, what's your take on this?
[01:34:26.769 --> 01:34:28.550]  Alex, look, man, this is a script.
[01:34:28.550 --> 01:34:29.751]  You know how they operate.
[01:34:29.751 --> 01:34:32.272]  It's a suspense thriller with a mind-screwed ending.
[01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:32.991]  Well, let's
[01:34:54.172 --> 01:34:59.733]  That's right, and timing is everything, and as one of my crews said, Connor, this is made-for-TV stuff.
[01:34:59.733 --> 01:35:08.055]  I mean, this is just central casting, central programming, how they find the van, how it's rolled out, the helicopters, everything.
[01:35:08.055 --> 01:35:11.876]  The fake bombs, it's incredible.
[01:35:11.876 --> 01:35:13.376]  I'm down in South Florida, man.
[01:35:13.376 --> 01:35:23.318]  I got a bunch of, you know, 1776 Don't Tread On Me stickers on the back of my Jeep, and I gotta replace them every month or two because, you know, they're always peeling off.
[01:35:24.026 --> 01:35:28.169]  Like you said, that looks like a screenshot that's straight out of the factory.
[01:35:28.169 --> 01:35:32.051]  If they want to catch this guy to see when they made those stickers, it won't be hard.
[01:35:32.051 --> 01:35:33.892]  You know, this is Hollywood in the making.
[01:35:33.892 --> 01:35:36.134]  Well, that's exactly what my crew said.
[01:35:36.134 --> 01:35:40.697]  They said I ought to offer a $50,000 reward for the people that did that.
[01:35:42.267 --> 01:35:43.388]  They won't do it.
[01:35:43.388 --> 01:35:44.048]  They won't do it.
[01:35:44.048 --> 01:35:46.330]  Because it was fabricated at some Hollywood production site.
[01:35:46.330 --> 01:35:47.211]  It's ridiculous.
[01:35:57.242 --> 01:36:02.507]  But what the Democrats don't have any facts right now, they just run it on emotions.
[01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:09.853]  So they're just trying to connect this patching just, you know, to an event to try to divert our attention off the migrant caravan.
[01:36:09.853 --> 01:36:14.217]  And I honestly think that they're going to try to hit the caravan in order to make
[01:36:15.129 --> 01:36:17.390]  Trump, look, because what has Trump been running on?
[01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:18.250]  We're going to build a wall.
[01:36:18.250 --> 01:36:19.651]  We can't allow these immigrants.
[01:36:19.651 --> 01:36:21.411]  What did Trump just do?
[01:36:21.411 --> 01:36:24.692]  Mattis is now employing troops down to the border.
[01:36:24.692 --> 01:36:28.153]  I think it's going to be a rogue military member or something like that.
[01:36:28.153 --> 01:36:29.154]  And you already said it.
[01:36:29.154 --> 01:36:30.734]  Owen hit on it yesterday.
[01:36:30.734 --> 01:36:33.215]  They got the bombs already in the trucks.
[01:36:33.215 --> 01:36:34.616]  I don't put it past them.
[01:36:34.616 --> 01:36:35.656]  I don't put it past them.
[01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:43.368]  The good news is, if you look at all the comments everywhere, no one is buying that this is real.
[01:36:43.368 --> 01:36:44.489]  The whole thing's so fake.
[01:36:44.489 --> 01:36:46.950]  And now this guy, and they call him white?
[01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:47.950]  It's fake bombs.
[01:36:47.950 --> 01:36:48.851]  He's not white.
[01:36:48.851 --> 01:36:50.231]  Every level is BS.
[01:36:50.231 --> 01:36:56.915]  And he worked for the tribal government that is the casinos, which are total...
[01:36:59.089 --> 01:36:59.810]  100% Democrats.
[01:36:59.810 --> 01:37:00.530]  I hear you.
[01:37:00.530 --> 01:37:01.511]  Look at the timing.
[01:37:01.511 --> 01:37:02.612]  Shane, thank you for the great call.
[01:37:02.612 --> 01:37:04.313]  A lot of great points there.
[01:37:04.313 --> 01:37:07.595]  Okay, who's been holding the next longest?
[01:37:07.595 --> 01:37:12.439]  Let's talk to Ken, who was part of the Bomb Threat Response Force.
[01:37:12.439 --> 01:37:15.040]  In what group?
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:15.801]  Ken, what did you do?
[01:37:15.801 --> 01:37:17.862]  And give us your view on this.
[01:37:17.862 --> 01:37:22.746]  Yes, I was a Fire Chief trained in Bomb Threat Response in South Carolina by the Air Force EOD.
[01:37:24.219 --> 01:37:31.002]  And you're going to get slammed now for calling a hoax a hoax, and I'm going to give you empirical evidence right from the Post Office itself.
[01:37:31.002 --> 01:37:32.603]  These were not bombs.
[01:37:32.603 --> 01:37:37.545]  They didn't have a triggering device, they didn't have a propellant or an incendiary, and they didn't have a detonator.
[01:37:37.545 --> 01:37:38.505]  That's not a bomb.
[01:37:38.505 --> 01:37:41.987]  If you want to call these pipe bombs, they ain't pipe bombs, they're hype bombs.
[01:37:41.987 --> 01:37:43.148]  They're bull.
[01:37:43.148 --> 01:37:45.028]  And the signs are clear.
[01:37:45.028 --> 01:37:48.610]  I sent Rob Due a link to the U.S.
[01:37:48.610 --> 01:37:50.051]  Post Office poster number 84.
[01:37:51.485 --> 01:38:00.913]  That's POS84.pdf and look at the picture if you can put up on the screen of all the telltale signs that it was a suspect package to begin with.
[01:38:00.913 --> 01:38:08.499]  Excess postage that was not canceled by the post office so that it would make for sure it would go through the mail but it wasn't even sent by the Postal Service.
[01:38:08.499 --> 01:38:16.705]  Printed out big labels so that the address, even though there's misspellings in the name, the address is clear so that they make it to the right location and the
[01:38:19.850 --> 01:38:22.551]  The other one, right out of the manual.
[01:38:22.551 --> 01:38:23.252]  No, I understand.
[01:38:23.252 --> 01:38:24.252]  The labels are fake.
[01:38:24.252 --> 01:38:25.193]  They're not bombs.
[01:38:25.193 --> 01:38:25.973]  I understand.
[01:38:25.973 --> 01:38:29.655]  Look, law enforcement has said there was no explosive!
[01:38:29.655 --> 01:38:31.796]  There's not even a detonator!
[01:38:31.796 --> 01:38:33.517]  Alex, it's going to blow your mind.
[01:38:33.517 --> 01:38:41.681]  Get the crew to do the search for suspect package USPS poster and put poster number 84 up on the screen for everybody to see.
[01:38:41.681 --> 01:38:47.104]  You could overlay that manila envelope right over their example of a suspect package.
[01:38:47.526 --> 01:38:48.747]  These were decoys, Alex.
[01:38:48.747 --> 01:38:49.868]  They were never intended to blow up.
[01:38:49.868 --> 01:38:51.649]  You called it from day one.
[01:38:51.649 --> 01:38:54.111]  They were made that you could see them across the room.
[01:38:54.111 --> 01:39:00.516]  In fact, if I was the fire chief in charge of that scene, I wouldn't have evacuated the building in a hurry, because I don't look at it as a decoy device.
[01:39:00.516 --> 01:39:07.602]  It was just a diversion, and that there's some other explosive device somewhere else that's real, and that these were made to get us to go into the usual protocols.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:12.721]  Just bottleneck everybody out and choke points and bottlenecks where they could get killed by real devices.
[01:39:12.721 --> 01:39:14.461]  And let's be clear.
[01:39:14.461 --> 01:39:15.301]  You're trained in this.
[01:39:15.301 --> 01:39:19.442]  We're putting up the official poster where they train people in the post office and you're right.
[01:39:19.442 --> 01:39:26.163]  Just like the Navy SEALs try to sneak fake bombs through things for training and the military and the ATF does it, you're right.
[01:39:26.163 --> 01:39:32.925]  This looks like it was someone trained in how to put a decoy in to see if people trained in class would catch it.
[01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:33.445]  Which again,
[01:39:35.124 --> 01:39:50.715]  And don't tell me that reporter that posted it, criminally negligent, posted that picture of the suspect device, didn't know how to identify a suspect package when he works at a major news outlet like that.
[01:39:50.715 --> 01:39:52.436]  I mean, that's total bull.
[01:39:52.436 --> 01:39:55.598]  And we know that these devices all arrived at the same time.
[01:39:55.598 --> 01:40:01.902]  This, this seminal guy, Sayyaf, could not have hit all these locations at the same time.
[01:40:01.902 --> 01:40:03.003]  Obviously, he's got help.
[01:40:05.455 --> 01:40:07.396]  So, I might be the bomber, apparently.
[01:40:07.396 --> 01:40:10.338]  I'm glad I sold my white van that I used for work years ago.
[01:40:10.338 --> 01:40:12.040]  No, but I think you hit the nail on the head here, Ken.
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:12.920]  Hold on, Ken.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.121]  You're right.
[01:40:14.121 --> 01:40:17.924]  I said that if we buy into this, gut level, there's something bigger coming.
[01:40:17.924 --> 01:40:21.166]  And you're saying you think that as well?
[01:40:21.166 --> 01:40:21.526]  Yes, sir.
[01:40:21.526 --> 01:40:22.767]  This is all a decoy.
[01:40:22.767 --> 01:40:25.549]  This is... Steve Pichinik's going to cover it in a minute.
[01:40:25.549 --> 01:40:30.973]  When they want you to look at your left... at the left hand, look at the left hand, look at the left hand, check the right hand and hope you're not too late.
[01:40:30.973 --> 01:40:33.615]  Because the blow, the punch is coming from the right hand.
[01:40:34.153 --> 01:40:34.213]  And
[01:40:55.373 --> 01:41:00.334]  Once they get us seeing the lepers as victims and buying that narrative, then the big attack comes.
[01:41:00.334 --> 01:41:01.915]  You can see the buildup.
[01:41:01.915 --> 01:41:03.555]  That's why they want me shut down.
[01:41:03.555 --> 01:41:08.397]  They don't want people to know what's going on so they don't hear this debate when they pull this crap off.
[01:41:08.397 --> 01:41:08.917]  God bless you.
[01:41:08.917 --> 01:41:09.957]  I appreciate your call, Ken.
[01:41:09.957 --> 01:41:12.318]  Another amazing caller.
[01:41:12.318 --> 01:41:14.118]  Let's do one more call before we go to break here.
[01:41:14.118 --> 01:41:17.339]  Steve in Indiana.
[01:41:17.339 --> 01:41:20.880]  Thank you for holding Air Force DOD bombing suspect topic.
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:22.761]  Go ahead, please.
[01:41:22.761 --> 01:41:23.201]  Hey, Alex.
[01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:23.781]  How you doing?
[01:41:23.781 --> 01:41:23.981]  Good.
[01:41:25.336 --> 01:41:25.596]  Good.
[01:41:25.596 --> 01:41:32.641]  Yeah, I called in yesterday about this whole thing and this just added fire or fuel to the fire of what I was thinking.
[01:41:32.641 --> 01:41:37.345]  It finally came to my mind what I was thinking yesterday.
[01:41:37.345 --> 01:41:38.826]  All of this is so perfect.
[01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:45.231]  Like you said about the van and the guy and the rhetoric and the bombs and all of this.
[01:41:45.231 --> 01:41:51.936]  Back when I was doing EOD work, we didn't investigate like a detective would, but we did a lot of intelligence work.
[01:41:52.717 --> 01:41:55.278]  And this is what we would call an orgy of evidence.
[01:41:55.278 --> 01:41:57.800]  It's like too perfect.
[01:41:57.800 --> 01:41:59.140]  It's too perfect.
[01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:01.622]  There's too much stuff here.
[01:42:01.622 --> 01:42:05.424]  They didn't leave anything to be, you know, like, gee, what about this?
[01:42:05.424 --> 01:42:09.186]  Or where, you know, we would expect to maybe find this, but we don't see that.
[01:42:09.186 --> 01:42:11.447]  Everything lines up perfectly.
[01:42:11.447 --> 01:42:13.708]  And it's, it's too perfect.
[01:42:13.708 --> 01:42:16.870]  It's like, like you've been saying, it's like scripted.
[01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:20.992]  You know, it's like somebody went through the check boxes and went, okay, we've got
[01:42:21.539 --> 01:42:24.723]  The guy that looks white, but isn't really white.
[01:42:24.723 --> 01:42:28.687]  We got the bombs that look like bombs, but they're overdone and they look ridiculous.
[01:42:28.687 --> 01:42:29.067]  Stay there.
[01:42:29.067 --> 01:42:30.269]  I want to come back and have you finish.
[01:42:30.269 --> 01:42:38.938]  And Roger Stone's popping in for like five minutes on the Seminole gangster connection and the massive Democratic funding by the casinos.
[01:42:38.938 --> 01:42:40.059]  A little bit more calls, but stay there.
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:49.806]  Yeah, it's like when I saw the Hillary so-called live town hall, I said, that's not live, those are actors, and that shot the highest definition I've ever seen.
[01:42:49.806 --> 01:42:57.452]  And then of course it was later, because we all know what we're seeing, we're not stupid, if we're conscious.
[01:42:57.452 --> 01:43:03.736]  We're bringing back one of the biggest fan-favorite formulas we've ever offered, with even better ingredients.
[01:43:03.736 --> 01:43:04.777]  Ultimate Bone Broth.

[01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:48.152]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[01:45:03.368 --> 01:45:12.058]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:45:12.058 --> 01:45:14.061]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:45:14.061 --> 01:45:17.505]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[01:45:17.505 --> 01:45:20.128]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:45:20.128 --> 01:45:21.609]  So we've already had incredible success.
[01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:34.830]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[01:45:35.976 --> 01:45:39.700]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.881]  We'll win.
[01:45:40.881 --> 01:45:43.764]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[01:45:43.764 --> 01:45:50.931]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:54.634]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[01:45:54.634 --> 01:45:56.196]  This is InfoWars' Darcus Howard.
[01:45:56.196 --> 01:45:57.056]  We need your support.
[01:45:57.056 --> 01:45:57.597]  I'm counting on you.
[01:45:57.937 --> 01:46:02.981]  Please tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your community, constantly, this is a censored show.
[01:46:02.981 --> 01:46:04.142]  They want to shut it down.
[01:46:04.142 --> 01:46:05.743]  Don't let them do it.
[01:46:05.743 --> 01:46:07.845]  Infowars.com.
[01:46:07.845 --> 01:46:09.086]  We're in your hands.
[01:46:09.086 --> 01:46:22.996]  If you don't spread the word about Infowars, if you don't spread the word about Newswars.com, if you don't get the great Patriot t-shirts with all the beautiful designs, if you don't get the water filtration and air filtration that's the best out there, very low prices, if you don't get the great supplements, we won't be here.
[01:46:22.996 --> 01:46:23.697]  It's up to you.
[01:46:23.697 --> 01:46:26.199]  And you've been responding, you've been supporting, so I want to thank you.
[01:46:26.479 --> 01:46:29.601]  You're also getting really great products like X2, the last run of it.
[01:46:29.601 --> 01:46:30.722]  Secret 12, amazing.
[01:46:30.722 --> 01:46:32.323]  Vitamin B12, the highest quality.
[01:46:32.323 --> 01:46:34.304]  Brain Force Plus, now at 20% more.
[01:46:34.304 --> 01:46:46.913]  It's all 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping, but it's got to end by this weekend because so many of the great products are running low, like Knockout, the great sleep aid, like Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[01:46:46.913 --> 01:46:50.215]  Nobody can get it at that price, but you are the folks that have stood with us
[01:46:50.475 --> 01:46:52.177]  So it's a 360 win-win at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:46:52.177 --> 01:46:52.837]  Please take action.
[01:46:52.837 --> 01:46:54.519]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:16.184 --> 01:47:19.326]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:47:19.326 --> 01:47:22.308]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:47:22.308 --> 01:47:30.613]  In the Mississippi River, she's a gold drive.
[01:47:30.613 --> 01:47:33.695]  The interest is up and the stock market's down.
[01:47:33.695 --> 01:47:37.697]  And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[01:47:37.697 --> 01:47:38.938]  Well, we're taking your phone calls.
[01:47:38.938 --> 01:47:41.600]  Roger Stone's popping in for like five minutes via phone.
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:42.741]  Matt Brack in one segment.
[01:47:43.780 --> 01:47:45.441]  Steve McCheng is probably going to pop in.
[01:47:45.441 --> 01:47:46.823]  He's got to get back to his house.
[01:47:46.823 --> 01:47:49.405]  He's in Florida.
[01:47:49.405 --> 01:47:53.208]  And we will give you their expert takes on this.
[01:47:53.208 --> 01:47:54.469]  But this whole thing is too perfect.
[01:47:54.469 --> 01:47:57.751]  That's what it's called, an orgy of evidence.
[01:47:57.751 --> 01:48:02.635]  Just like with the situation you saw with Vegas.
[01:48:02.635 --> 01:48:06.859]  Oh, it's all him, but then there's all this other evidence around that they don't want you to look at.
[01:48:06.859 --> 01:48:08.860]  And suddenly that story gets shut down.
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:09.541]  But not this one.
[01:48:10.811 --> 01:48:15.913]  They're hyping it like it's the end of the world and Trump and Republicans are violent.
[01:48:15.913 --> 01:48:19.435]  And we're sorry we called for violence, which we didn't do.
[01:48:19.435 --> 01:48:22.816]  And then the big event comes.
[01:48:22.816 --> 01:48:23.356]  You can see it.
[01:48:23.356 --> 01:48:25.377]  I mean, they don't go on every news channel.
[01:48:25.377 --> 01:48:32.600]  I mean, every major news channel from CBS to ABC to CNN to MSNBC to PBS to NPR.
[01:48:32.600 --> 01:48:34.741]  I mean, my wife listens to NPR.
[01:48:34.741 --> 01:48:37.643]  She doesn't believe it, but that's what she listens to for news.
[01:48:37.643 --> 01:48:38.223]  She said, honey,
[01:48:39.767 --> 01:48:44.209]  You're on every news segment saying you're saying kill people, but you didn't say that.
[01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:45.650]  I'm like, yeah, they're getting ready to set me up.
[01:48:45.650 --> 01:48:47.431]  This is months ago.
[01:48:47.431 --> 01:48:49.952]  And sure enough, I'm not even making myself the topic.
[01:48:49.952 --> 01:48:51.773]  It's all over the news.
[01:48:51.773 --> 01:48:57.737]  Roger Stone just saw on MSNBC that I'm causing this because I said George Soros was a Nazi.
[01:48:57.737 --> 01:49:03.580]  He said he helped round people up on 60 Minutes.
[01:49:03.580 --> 01:49:05.681]  So now because he got mailed a fake firecracker,
[01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:16.492]  These fake road flare bombs we made are more dangerous, because they actually can light these and do something, than the crap that got sent.
[01:49:16.492 --> 01:49:19.553]  So, shopping bags about to happen.
[01:49:19.553 --> 01:49:24.334]  They don't go on every channel and say that Trump and Alex Jones are calling for violence, when we're not, for no reason.
[01:49:24.334 --> 01:49:27.174]  They're setting us up.
[01:49:27.174 --> 01:49:28.094]  So how do we handle this?
[01:49:28.094 --> 01:49:28.715]  How do we respond?
[01:49:28.715 --> 01:49:29.595]  Go ahead and finish up, Steve.
[01:49:29.595 --> 01:49:30.495]  I appreciate you holding.
[01:49:30.495 --> 01:49:31.455]  You're making some great points.
[01:49:31.455 --> 01:49:34.896]  Go ahead, former Air Force DOD bomb expert.
[01:49:36.397 --> 01:49:44.643]  Yeah, I think the best way to handle it, Alex, I was thinking about this over the break, is we need to talk to people.
[01:49:44.643 --> 01:49:48.526]  This whole thing was made for a culture that was raised on TV.
[01:49:48.526 --> 01:49:57.152]  You know, they're looking at this stuff and they see the same stuff they see on TV and they go, oh my gosh, it's like, that's just like that CSI episode that I saw.
[01:49:57.152 --> 01:50:03.196]  We need to talk to them and explain to them how fake this really is and what it's doing and how it's manipulating them.
[01:50:03.735 --> 01:50:10.117]  To try to get them to vote a certain way, or to choose a certain party, or whatever.
[01:50:10.117 --> 01:50:14.218]  You know, it's trying to get their attention off of what's really important.
[01:50:14.218 --> 01:50:16.818]  And it's the things that you've been talking about for years.
[01:50:16.818 --> 01:50:30.662]  That the globalists are taking over, that they're trying to steal our liberty, they're trying to take our free speech, they're trying to take our guns, and we can't get people to understand
[01:50:31.519 --> 01:50:32.920]  That this is really happening.
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.120]  This is not a dream.
[01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.501]  This is not some conspiracy theory.
[01:50:36.501 --> 01:50:37.822]  This is real.
[01:50:37.822 --> 01:50:38.302]  It's real.
[01:50:38.302 --> 01:50:38.662]  That's right.
[01:50:38.662 --> 01:50:46.586]  Remember, Trump had only been in office a few weeks, and somebody was defacing Jewish centers and knocking over hundreds of Jewish tombstones.
[01:50:46.586 --> 01:50:50.267]  And Trump talked to federal law enforcement, and they said, yeah, we have a suspect.
[01:50:50.267 --> 01:50:51.708]  It's the left doing it themselves.
[01:50:51.708 --> 01:50:57.711]  So he said on the news, on Fox and Friends, I think somebody, some leftist is doing this to blame me.
[01:50:57.711 --> 01:50:58.951]  They said, oh my God, how dare he?
[01:50:58.951 --> 01:50:59.932]  He had to do a special
[01:51:01.778 --> 01:51:07.944]  Early State of the Union to say, oh, and I believe that there's anti-Semitism and you shouldn't deface Jewish centers.
[01:51:07.944 --> 01:51:14.150]  And then it turned out a month later that it was a leftist Jewish man doing it to blame Trump.
[01:51:14.150 --> 01:51:15.331]  Did that get any coverage?
[01:51:15.331 --> 01:51:15.491]  No.
[01:51:15.491 --> 01:51:17.373]  It was in the New Jersey papers.
[01:51:17.373 --> 01:51:19.635]  But no other drug report linked to it.
[01:51:19.635 --> 01:51:20.596]  We talked about it.
[01:51:20.596 --> 01:51:21.337]  But that's what I mean.
[01:51:21.337 --> 01:51:24.280]  No one remembers when it comes out later it's them.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.121]  The Air Force Academy.
[01:51:26.479 --> 01:51:32.944]  Someone's putting on the vending machines, no N-words allowed, and it was a black leftist!
[01:51:32.944 --> 01:51:40.170]  I mean, like, 95%... When are there poop swastikas that someone really did it?
[01:51:40.170 --> 01:51:43.593]  I mean, when does someone really burn a cross in a yard now?
[01:51:43.593 --> 01:51:45.314]  Or burn down a black church?
[01:51:45.314 --> 01:51:48.477]  Every time they catch the left doing it to be the victims.
[01:51:48.477 --> 01:51:50.599]  God bless you, Steve, I appreciate your call.
[01:51:50.599 --> 01:51:52.400]  Amazing callers.
[01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:53.321]  And we're gonna go to...
[01:51:55.649 --> 01:51:59.330]  Kevin next, and then Eagle Eye, and just in the order you called him, we'll go to all these great people.
[01:51:59.330 --> 01:51:59.831]  Vox?
[01:51:59.831 --> 01:52:01.631]  Vox is actually next.
[01:52:01.631 --> 01:52:04.332]  And then we'll go to Eagle Eye, and then Kevin, and others.
[01:52:04.332 --> 01:52:19.118]  But I wanted to bring Roger Stone on for just five minutes, because he's watching MSNBC, he saw this, and he's also an expert on the political groups and constellations and makeup of Florida, and he has something to say about the Patsy, the identified
[01:52:20.991 --> 01:52:27.273]  Bomber here, you know, the new Tim McVeigh, the new Lee Harvey Oswald, the new Sirhan Sirhan.
[01:52:27.273 --> 01:52:35.675]  Suspect Mel Bomber identified as Cesar Altier Cyock and he worked for the tribal government of the Seminoles.
[01:52:35.675 --> 01:52:39.296]  So, what is your first observations of this, Roger Stone?
[01:52:40.717 --> 01:52:50.667]  Well Alex, obviously all of this breaking news coming very quickly in order to try to get the American people to rush to a judgment that these
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:56.662]  Uh, bombs were placed by some rabid Trump supporter.
[01:52:56.662 --> 01:53:09.186]  The mainstream media has turned up some photographs that appear to show him at a MAGA rally, and we're told that his van or his car had Trump bumper stickers.
[01:53:09.186 --> 01:53:15.548]  However, it is interesting to me that he works as an employee for the Seminole Indian tribe
[01:53:16.468 --> 01:53:17.669]  of Florida.
[01:53:17.669 --> 01:53:29.359]  These are mega mega wealthy casino owners and heavy heavy funders multi-million dollar funders over the years of Democratic Party operations.
[01:53:29.359 --> 01:53:32.421]  I find that to be an interesting anomaly.
[01:53:32.421 --> 01:53:37.765]  Why would someone like that employ some rabbit Trump supporter?
[01:53:37.765 --> 01:53:45.872]  It's illogical and it may be the thread that those who are trying to unravel what has really happened here should pull on.
[01:53:48.697 --> 01:53:49.758]  But look at the timing.
[01:53:49.758 --> 01:53:50.738]  Look at the pre-programming.
[01:53:50.738 --> 01:53:52.579]  We've been predicting this was coming.
[01:53:52.579 --> 01:53:55.501]  This is incredibly synthetic, Roger.
[01:53:55.501 --> 01:53:58.662]  Well, and this guy looks to me like he's set up by a Patsy.
[01:53:58.662 --> 01:54:07.047]  Let me note that, as far as I understand, he is in the custody right now of Broward County Democratic Sheriff Scott Israel.
[01:54:07.822 --> 01:54:14.747]  Who was somewhat controversial earlier this year in his advocacy of taking away our Second Amendment rights.
[01:54:14.747 --> 01:54:19.810]  And they're the same ones that admittedly stood down and let happen what happened.
[01:54:19.810 --> 01:54:21.812]  And have been, oh, isn't it funny?
[01:54:21.812 --> 01:54:24.554]  Everything magically happens in that trusted county.
[01:54:26.105 --> 01:54:45.844]  It is very ironic that we await a report from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which I had hoped would be out before this election, but it is undisputed that the operation was bungled at Parkland School, where we had these tragic shootings.
[01:54:46.944 --> 01:54:57.529]  This is a partisan elected Democrat, who I actually know, and the reputed bomber, the alleged bomber, is in his custody.
[01:54:57.529 --> 01:55:00.951]  I'd like to know more about who made the arrest.
[01:55:00.951 --> 01:55:06.713]  Exactly, who had the tip and who found this van that's all perfect and brand new with all these perfect stickers on it.
[01:55:06.713 --> 01:55:08.674]  Wow, I hadn't put two and two together, Roger.
[01:55:08.674 --> 01:55:12.816]  Broward County, the leftist stand-down sheriff.
[01:55:14.261 --> 01:55:15.022]  That's where you live.
[01:55:15.022 --> 01:55:22.647]  I know up front you've kind of, you know, been a little bit supportive because your son is a deputy there, but then you had to admit later, no, it looks like a stand-down.
[01:55:22.647 --> 01:55:23.648]  Wow!
[01:55:23.648 --> 01:55:26.450]  This really stinks to high heaven now, Roger.
[01:55:26.450 --> 01:55:33.975]  Yeah, I didn't like the prior Republican sheriff because he turned out to be corrupt in all honesty, so therefore I will vote for honesty over corruption.
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:37.263]  But in this case, I find this suspicious.
[01:55:37.263 --> 01:55:38.924]  Who found this guy?
[01:55:38.924 --> 01:55:39.865]  Who apprehended him?
[01:55:39.865 --> 01:55:41.347]  Was it the FBI?
[01:55:41.347 --> 01:55:47.833]  Or was he apprehended by the Broward County Sheriff's Office and turned over to the FBI or reported to the FBI?
[01:55:47.833 --> 01:55:58.183]  Let's remember, we interviewed three students the first two days and had local newscasts where people be filming the news doing interviews on their iPhones or droids.
[01:55:59.315 --> 01:55:59.936]  We're good to go.
[01:56:17.998 --> 01:56:19.478]  I don't know what happened.
[01:56:19.478 --> 01:56:23.340]  They spun that, that I said no one died, and they were crisis actors.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:24.940]  There is no video of that.
[01:56:24.940 --> 01:56:26.360]  I didn't say that.
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:27.201]  You didn't say that?
[01:56:27.201 --> 01:56:28.001]  I didn't say that.
[01:56:28.001 --> 01:56:28.681]  None of us said that.
[01:56:28.681 --> 01:56:32.842]  We said there was a stand down, which turned out to be true, Roger.
[01:56:32.842 --> 01:56:41.785]  Well, we also reported that for some odd reason, the Secret Service visited this high school, pardon me, the FBI visited this high school weeks before.
[01:56:42.864 --> 01:56:48.874]  Under what regimen do the FBI go inspect local high schools?
[01:56:48.874 --> 01:56:50.717]  All we did was ask questions.
[01:56:52.014 --> 01:57:06.360]  By appointing a Blue Ribbon Commission under the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Rick Scott has essentially stopped any public comment about Parkland as everyone awaits the results of that report.
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:07.320]  Sure, stay there, stay there.
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:13.382]  I'm going to go to Eagle Eye and I'm going to go to Kevin and Matt and everybody else like Vox and those that have been holding along us right after you leave.
[01:57:13.382 --> 01:57:14.603]  But five more minutes.
[01:57:14.603 --> 01:57:16.344]  Trump is saying this is hurting the red wave.
[01:57:16.344 --> 01:57:16.744]  I agree.
[01:57:17.384 --> 01:57:18.524]  Is Trump wrong to come out?
[01:57:18.524 --> 01:57:21.445]  I mean, I think he's right to come out and say, oh, yeah, it's terrible, whoever did this.
[01:57:21.445 --> 01:57:23.826]  But he should also add, thank God they were fake bombs.
[01:57:23.826 --> 01:57:26.647]  It wasn't like Scalise got shot by a real bullet.
[01:57:26.647 --> 01:57:29.228]  But I think he thinks, oh, they'll get political points for that.
[01:57:29.228 --> 01:57:32.069]  No, they're all blaming him and me and you everywhere.
[01:57:32.069 --> 01:57:35.670]  So when we come back in two minutes, you said you saw MSNBC blaming me.
[01:57:35.670 --> 01:57:38.651]  I've got stacks of articles here saying I'm to blame.
[01:57:38.651 --> 01:57:40.091]  And it's just incredible.
[01:57:40.091 --> 01:57:40.691]  We'll be back.
[01:57:40.691 --> 01:57:41.312]  Third hour.
[01:57:41.312 --> 01:57:41.872]  Your calls.
[01:57:41.872 --> 01:57:44.012]  Roger Stone, Matt Bracken and more.
[01:57:44.012 --> 01:57:45.513]  Whatever you do, share those live links.
[01:57:47.196 --> 01:57:57.799]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[01:57:57.799 --> 01:57:59.859]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[01:57:59.859 --> 01:58:02.720]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[01:58:02.720 --> 01:58:04.221]  It's made in the USA.
[01:58:04.221 --> 01:58:11.042]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:12.263]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[01:58:13.103 --> 01:58:22.810]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[01:58:22.810 --> 01:58:39.642]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[01:58:39.642 --> 01:58:42.804]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[01:58:42.964 --> 01:58:47.950]  Now it's time to change our bodies with a Z-Shield at Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:47.950 --> 01:58:53.276]  They now know that Infowars has the spirit, the program, the code to relaunch it all.
[01:58:53.276 --> 01:58:55.359]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[01:58:55.359 --> 01:59:00.685]  To George Soros and to Hillary Clinton and to Barack Obama and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[01:59:02.359 --> 01:59:03.860]  I'm deaf and they know it.
[01:59:03.860 --> 01:59:05.121]  I'm deaf of their system.
[01:59:05.121 --> 01:59:20.434]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products and we are hurting.
[01:59:20.674 --> 01:59:21.375]  We're good to go.
[01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:58.827]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:58.827 --> 02:00:00.947]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:00.947 --> 02:00:02.928]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:00:02.928 --> 02:00:15.032]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.
[02:00:15.032 --> 02:00:15.572]  You win some, you lose some.
[02:00:17.321 --> 02:00:20.842]  Well, Broward County, a lot of busy beavers down there politically.
[02:00:20.842 --> 02:00:24.444]  That's where Roger Stones lived for many years in between New York.
[02:00:24.444 --> 02:00:27.445]  And his son's in jeopardy right there in Broward County.
[02:00:27.445 --> 02:00:39.090]  And there was a police stand down, not by his son, but by others, ordered by the sheriff, who now busted this guy that works for the tribal government, the casinos, Cesar Altier Sayoc.
[02:00:39.090 --> 02:00:43.512]  And Roger was held over to get into what he thinks Trump should say and do, but he just dropped a bombshell.
[02:00:44.867 --> 02:00:49.131]  Roger, repeat for listeners what you just told me that's hiding in plain view.
[02:00:49.131 --> 02:00:53.215]  Has anybody heard about this guy in Trumpian politics in your area?
[02:00:54.467 --> 02:00:57.708]  No, I mean, I have reached out through my network.
[02:00:57.708 --> 02:01:08.611]  I've spoken to many, many of the local grassroots Trumps groups in South Florida, including in Miami, many friends in the Proud Boys, many friends in the Americans for Trump.
[02:01:08.611 --> 02:01:12.413]  We had a great rally in Pompano Beach the night before last.
[02:01:12.413 --> 02:01:16.454]  We had a great rally at the Palm Beach Kennel Club a month ago.
[02:01:17.474 --> 02:01:21.716]  None of the people that I network to know this individual.
[02:01:21.716 --> 02:01:24.658]  We haven't been able to find anyone who knows him.
[02:01:24.658 --> 02:01:26.478]  I find that odd.
[02:01:26.478 --> 02:01:34.222]  If I were the president, frankly, I would have FBI Director Wray in my office right now and say, well, Mr. Wray, what do you know?
[02:01:35.003 --> 02:01:35.964]  Who arrested him?
[02:01:35.964 --> 02:01:37.484]  How did we learn about him?
[02:01:37.484 --> 02:01:38.865]  What have we really got on him?
[02:01:38.865 --> 02:01:40.466]  Where did it come from?
[02:01:40.466 --> 02:01:44.828]  I think the president is in a position to get a better command of the facts than anyone.
[02:01:44.828 --> 02:01:57.314]  And despite the fact that his FBI director is a deep skater who looked more comfortable behind the, as a croupier in Atlantic City, you know, he had to get some hard answers.
[02:01:57.854 --> 02:02:08.290]  The FBI director who, when he learned about leaking by the FBI and their misuse by Obama, said, well, we're going to have sensitivity training to solve that problem.
[02:02:08.290 --> 02:02:08.691]  That guy.
[02:02:12.145 --> 02:02:22.470]  But that's big news that you're like one of the big kingpins of Republican politics in the state, but particularly in that county, and no one has ever heard or seen of this guy.
[02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:27.892]  And then he's got a Twitter account that loves Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.
[02:02:27.892 --> 02:02:29.293]  This whole thing smells bad.
[02:02:29.293 --> 02:02:35.896]  Like you said, this whole Trumpmobile, Colbert saying, oh, it's the MAGA bomber, and magically it is.
[02:02:35.896 --> 02:02:37.917]  I mean, this thing is so synthetic, Roger.
[02:02:38.968 --> 02:02:41.410]  It does appear to be contrived.
[02:02:41.410 --> 02:03:02.843]  I think it's important to note that here in Florida, there's a real dichotomy between the Trump movement, grassroots amateurs, well-meaning patriots, people who were brought to the process to save their country because they couldn't stand what was happening and they saw in Trump somebody with the guts to change things, and the local Republican structure
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:15.264]  I'm deeply committed to either Jeb Bush and now Marco Rubio, who largely went through the motions of pretending to be for candidate Trump but sat on their hands.
[02:03:15.264 --> 02:03:26.729]  The Trump community is big and it is vibrant and it is active and it's very net-based and they're very communicative and they turn out in huge numbers.
[02:03:26.729 --> 02:03:32.311]  None of those people so far that I have been able to network to have heard of this individual.
[02:03:34.414 --> 02:03:36.775]  Well, that's another giant indicator.
[02:03:36.775 --> 02:03:38.656]  Roger Stone, we have a minute left.
[02:03:38.656 --> 02:03:41.998]  Anything else you think you should add?
[02:03:41.998 --> 02:04:00.007]  You know, what this shows me is that the polls the Democrats are looking at must have shown that this was moving post-Kavanaugh and after the spasms of violence that have been promulgated by the Democratic Party away from them.
[02:04:01.212 --> 02:04:06.906]  Yeah, their thug bully, their thug bully persona is hurting them, so magically now we're the bad guys.
[02:04:07.995 --> 02:04:17.939]  Andrew Cuomo calling for the New York Police Department to investigate the Proud Boys when video shows that it was Antifa who threw the first bottles and drew first blood.
[02:04:17.939 --> 02:04:27.523]  I think people see through that as raw political chicanery and, you know, that is not working for them.
[02:04:27.523 --> 02:04:30.004]  So now they bring this forward, 20 seconds.
[02:04:30.004 --> 02:04:34.546]  Do you agree though that if this trial balloon goes well, they may activate the real false flag?
[02:04:36.225 --> 02:04:40.646]  Look, I think they are capable of any potential act of violence.
[02:04:40.646 --> 02:04:41.887]  They have done it before.
[02:04:41.887 --> 02:04:44.448]  They have done it again.
[02:04:44.448 --> 02:04:49.349]  The Deep State realizes that Donald Trump is a threat to their global economy.
[02:04:49.349 --> 02:04:51.009]  That's right, and they want to stop him now.
[02:04:51.009 --> 02:04:51.710]  Great points, Roger.
[02:04:51.710 --> 02:04:54.110]  We'll talk to you more during the War Room today, 3 o'clock Central.
[02:04:54.110 --> 02:04:56.551]  Phone calls, Annette Bracken, straight ahead.
[02:04:56.551 --> 02:05:02.833]  Nourish a probiotic-friendly environment in your gut with Prebiotic Fiber by InfoWars Life.

[02:05:49.883 --> 02:05:52.585]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[02:06:12.400 --> 02:06:22.002]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:22.002 --> 02:06:29.284]  So, we were 14 days out, and then the arch-controllers of globalism, who are running all these criminal activities, get mailed fake pipe bombs.
[02:06:30.327 --> 02:06:34.651]  The police commissioner in New York said at the FBI, no real powder, no real detonator.
[02:06:34.651 --> 02:06:35.972]  It's just, it's fake.
[02:06:35.972 --> 02:06:37.613]  Not even a smoke bomb.
[02:06:37.613 --> 02:06:42.738]  These fake bombs we made as a joke that are road flares could actually burn something up if you lit them.
[02:06:42.738 --> 02:06:51.025]  So these are more dangerous than the fake bomb that they put out that absolutely has no danger that now 12 people have been mailed so they can all be victims in the news.
[02:06:52.631 --> 02:06:57.056]  Simply insane to see all of this unfolding.
[02:06:57.056 --> 02:07:04.363]  And now this individual works for the Seminole Nation, the Casinos, that are 100% Democrat, anti-Republican in that state.
[02:07:04.363 --> 02:07:14.654]  You've got the Sheriff Israel of Coward County that ordered the stand down during the Valentine's Day massacre there at Parkland.
[02:07:16.462 --> 02:07:21.210]  Where this guy gets picked up somewhere, the media gets called to then see the van, and then to have the O.J.
[02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:24.976]  Simpson ride in hysteria on the back of the wrecker.
[02:07:25.882 --> 02:07:27.323]  Well, my first point to make, Alex, is
[02:07:55.222 --> 02:07:58.304]  My question to the left and the media is, how stupid do you think we are?
[02:07:58.304 --> 02:08:08.693]  I mean, all the timing of all this, the very first story that I saw as far as all these bomb threats was the one about George Soros coming out of Salon.
[02:08:08.693 --> 02:08:11.915]  It's like, okay, timeout, I call bullshit.
[02:08:11.915 --> 02:08:16.859]  Sorry, I don't mean to swear on your fire station, but I call BS right there.
[02:08:16.859 --> 02:08:22.464]  Because George Soros, he has a friggin' pattern of behavior behind all this.
[02:08:22.464 --> 02:08:22.664]  I mean,
[02:08:23.194 --> 02:08:26.917]  It was you guys that leaked the documents that they staged the Baltimore riots.
[02:08:26.917 --> 02:08:39.206]  This man has short sold the pound back in 92 and boasts about it, saying, I know I'm taking money out of the British taxpayer's pockets, but if I think about that, how do I make a profit?
[02:08:39.206 --> 02:08:41.368]  This guy's a Nazi collaborator.
[02:08:41.368 --> 02:08:43.449]  He was behind the Arab Spring Revolts.
[02:08:43.449 --> 02:08:44.950]  He was behind Ukraine.
[02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:45.591]  It's a pattern.
[02:08:46.664 --> 02:09:03.980]  And he brags he's involved, and by the way, I don't listen to it, but families all told me, and every local news show has been paid to read PR every day that he fought the Nazis, and he was a victim of Nazis, and that I am defiling a Holocaust survivor, and that it's on the national news.
[02:09:03.980 --> 02:09:09.344]  So he's paying everyone to talk about now that he was a victim of the Nazis.
[02:09:09.344 --> 02:09:11.887]  It just shows how damn powerful this guy is.
[02:09:13.046 --> 02:09:20.733]  That's exactly my point, and I even tell people that, well, of course all the narratives are going to hype that up because the guy owns Media Matters for America.
[02:09:20.733 --> 02:09:22.014]  They oversee all of our media.
[02:09:22.014 --> 02:09:23.495]  Of course he's going to control the narrative.
[02:09:25.273 --> 02:09:28.015]  You know, you can lead a horse to water, you can't make him drink.
[02:09:28.015 --> 02:09:28.896]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:09:47.432 --> 02:09:49.193]  Well, something is stinking here.
[02:09:49.193 --> 02:10:02.284]  I think Trump's made a mistake here being... I'm glad he's saying we've caught the guy, whatever, but he should be saying it's suspicious, like he did about the Jewish Center attacks, because he's walking into them staging something bigger, I think.
[02:10:02.284 --> 02:10:03.225]  Absolutely.
[02:10:03.225 --> 02:10:09.430]  A good way to keep up-to-date on all these attacks is a page and website I found.
[02:10:09.430 --> 02:10:13.853]  They've got right-wing watch out there, while far-left watch has just popped up, and you
[02:10:14.867 --> 02:10:18.052]  The violence just every day coming out of... No, I agree.
[02:10:18.052 --> 02:10:23.239]  We should be following Left Wing Watch every day with a little report that shows all their incredible violence.
[02:10:23.239 --> 02:10:23.820]  God bless you.
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:24.921]  Thank you, Kevin.
[02:10:24.921 --> 02:10:25.742]  We're going to go to Vox.
[02:10:27.020 --> 02:10:27.340]  We're good to go.
[02:10:46.211 --> 02:10:51.013]  Remember, the FBI and the Justice Department at the top is a bunch of Clinton and globalist operatives.
[02:10:51.013 --> 02:10:54.134]  That's why this country's in so much trouble, but we'll see what happens.
[02:10:54.134 --> 02:10:59.956]  Matt Bracken, we called this, we predicted this, and you've been on top of it, you know, Monday saying it's fake bombs.
[02:10:59.956 --> 02:11:09.720]  That was confirmed the next day, or you said the day it happened, I guess that was Wednesday you said it was fake, and then the next day it was confirmed.
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.561]  What are you seeing now with this whole situation and this individual?
[02:11:14.889 --> 02:11:22.133]  It's another twist that it's Scott Israel in Broward County that's got the guy in custody.
[02:11:22.133 --> 02:11:26.576]  So it'll be interesting to see what kind of lawyers are in there talking to him.
[02:11:26.576 --> 02:11:28.637]  If there's an arraignment, I expect him to come out.
[02:11:30.139 --> 02:11:39.509]  If he could, he'd be wearing a MAGA hat and he'll be yelling, I love Trump, to go along with all the stickers on the windows of his van, which all appear to have been put on recently.
[02:11:39.509 --> 02:11:46.096]  If you actually had those stickers on your van in Broward County for the last couple of months, your car, your van would have been torched.
[02:11:46.096 --> 02:11:49.099]  I mean, keyed, torched, spray painted.
[02:11:49.099 --> 02:11:50.821]  So this is this is part of the setup.
[02:11:51.893 --> 02:12:01.121]  And it's where Congressman Deutch is, who's the leader of the anti-free speech movement, even worse than Pelosi.
[02:12:01.121 --> 02:12:10.990]  Yeah, those window stickers were obviously put on to be shown today, you know, to go along with the narrative.
[02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:12.191]  I expected an arraignment.
[02:12:12.191 --> 02:12:16.855]  He's going to yell, I love Trump, you know, Heil Trump, Trump forever.
[02:12:16.855 --> 02:12:17.656]  It's all part of it.
[02:12:18.419 --> 02:12:27.522]  And if you go back in his social media, I heard on the radio that his Twitter only goes back to 2016, which is when Trump was elected.
[02:12:27.522 --> 02:12:39.965]  And I have knowledge of infiltration of the right into the left and the left into the right by people scrubbing their social media and then waiting and then coming back as the opposite so that they can either
[02:12:40.505 --> 02:12:41.527]  Well, sure, that's well known.
[02:12:55.607 --> 02:13:12.309]  So it doesn't take a big stress of the imagination to see a guy not knowing exactly what his usefulness would be, but going on and creating a false social media persona as a uber conservative, so that when the time was right, you know, he could pop out as a Trump supporter.
[02:13:12.689 --> 02:13:14.511]  Doing something crazy.
[02:13:14.511 --> 02:13:18.554]  No, exactly, and people commit suicide for their political views.
[02:13:18.554 --> 02:13:24.459]  If he's willing to take one for the team, he mails it, he knows he's gonna get caught, he does this all without even being directed.
[02:13:24.459 --> 02:13:29.123]  The problem is all the pre-programming that this was coming by media shows me that he was being directed.
[02:13:30.518 --> 02:13:35.700]  It's very possible he was being directed, but on what level, you know, it remains to be seen.
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:42.543]  He might think that he's scrubbed his social media, but there might be ways to go in and find old social media.
[02:13:42.543 --> 02:13:44.143]  Whether or not that will be coming out... No, I agree.
[02:13:44.143 --> 02:13:46.764]  Why do you think now he's got three different aliases?
[02:13:46.764 --> 02:13:49.946]  I mean, it's him in videos on Facebook, it's him on Twitter.
[02:13:49.946 --> 02:13:52.166]  He's like a liberal, he's a conservative, but it's him.
[02:13:52.166 --> 02:13:54.907]  I mean, he just looks like some operative.
[02:13:54.907 --> 02:13:56.108]  Who would be playing both sides?
[02:13:58.433 --> 02:14:00.635]  Somebody that's doing this has a false flag.
[02:14:00.635 --> 02:14:03.538]  I mean, the van is so over the top.
[02:14:03.538 --> 02:14:10.104]  The last thing that a guy is going to do is make a van that looks like that while he's dropping off pipe bombs, supposed pipe bombs.
[02:14:10.104 --> 02:14:12.166]  You know, it's completely bogus.
[02:14:12.166 --> 02:14:18.593]  Oh, and by the way, we've now learned that MSNBC is blaming me for this, and they are saying that this guy tweeted InfoWars.
[02:14:20.563 --> 02:14:22.724]  Are there any InfoWars stickers on that van?
[02:14:22.724 --> 02:14:25.045]  It seems unlikely that he'd missed that.
[02:14:25.045 --> 02:14:28.846]  But, um, maybe he only asked for all the Republican stickers he could find.
[02:14:28.846 --> 02:14:35.268]  Of course, you know, if you sign up as, get on their, their donation list, they'll send you all the stickers you want.
[02:14:35.268 --> 02:14:36.828]  Some of them might not even be stickers.
[02:14:36.828 --> 02:14:43.251]  He might have actually, you know, taped some, uh, uh... Well, no, let me tell you, Matt, I can tell, it's a wrap.
[02:14:43.251 --> 02:14:47.132]  Somebody made a big Photoshop file of that, and that was professionally wrapped.
[02:14:50.959 --> 02:14:53.781]  Okay, yeah, I see that's not stickers, right.
[02:14:53.781 --> 02:14:55.142]  Yeah, and that's amazing.
[02:14:55.142 --> 02:14:57.543]  So it's part of the Trump on a tank.
[02:14:57.543 --> 02:15:00.545]  It's so bogus, I think that people are going to see it as a false flag.
[02:15:00.545 --> 02:15:03.027]  And crosshairs on the Democrats to make them heroes.
[02:15:04.130 --> 02:15:04.430]  Right.
[02:15:04.430 --> 02:15:06.152]  It's so obviously over-the-top.
[02:15:06.152 --> 02:15:09.455]  If he was a little bit more subtle, it would probably work better.
[02:15:09.455 --> 02:15:17.303]  But, you know, it's hard to get somebody like this to be able to regulate, you know, the subtlety or irony level.
[02:15:17.303 --> 02:15:25.692]  But I'm expecting next, in the surveillance videos where he's dropping off the packages, he'll be wearing a MAGA hat and a MAGA shirt.
[02:15:25.692 --> 02:15:27.434]  You know, I think that's what we'll see next.
[02:15:28.180 --> 02:15:29.361]  And I think it won't work.
[02:15:29.361 --> 02:15:32.022]  I think it just adds to the false flag narrative.
[02:15:32.022 --> 02:15:33.023]  You're not on CNN.
[02:15:33.023 --> 02:15:34.143]  They'll play it straight.
[02:15:34.143 --> 02:15:37.165]  But normal Americans are hip to false flags.
[02:15:37.165 --> 02:15:39.666]  Trump's worried it could hurt the red wave.
[02:15:39.666 --> 02:15:50.492]  We're going to come back and take calls from Vox, and we're going to take calls from Eagle Eye, and Jack, and Aaron, and Matt, and Garrett, and everybody else.
[02:15:50.492 --> 02:15:51.192]  Stay with us.

[02:15:52.813 --> 02:15:53.994]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:15:55.137 --> 02:16:01.482]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[02:16:01.482 --> 02:16:04.525]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[02:16:04.525 --> 02:16:10.090]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[02:16:10.450 --> 02:16:14.231]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[02:16:14.231 --> 02:16:15.492]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:16:15.492 --> 02:16:16.472]  Who do we fight for?
[02:16:16.472 --> 02:16:23.055]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[02:16:23.055 --> 02:16:25.116]  Available at Amazon Books.

[02:16:55.180 --> 02:16:56.401]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:56.401 --> 02:17:00.343]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.343 --> 02:17:01.864]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:17:01.864 --> 02:17:04.825]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:17:04.825 --> 02:17:10.388]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:11.589]  I can help you, too.
[02:17:11.589 --> 02:17:14.531]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:17:14.531 --> 02:17:16.752]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[02:17:25.713 --> 02:17:28.134]  A Big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.
[02:17:28.134 --> 02:17:36.257]  You need a water filter that removes chlorine, fluoride, pharmaceuticals, BPA and other endocrine disruptors, pesticides, bacteria, viruses and much more, right?
[02:17:36.257 --> 02:17:38.198]  And does it all at only two cents per gallon.

[02:17:56.448 --> 02:18:00.710]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[02:18:00.710 --> 02:18:04.172]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:18:04.172 --> 02:18:09.214]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts, they don't even know we have, like InfoWars Store, that just showed our products.
[02:18:09.214 --> 02:18:15.997]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:18:15.997 --> 02:18:21.080]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink.
[02:18:21.420 --> 02:18:27.522]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:18:27.522 --> 02:18:30.504]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:18:30.504 --> 02:18:31.604]  I want to keep going.
[02:18:31.604 --> 02:18:35.446]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:18:35.446 --> 02:18:37.446]  I want to push all the way.
[02:18:37.446 --> 02:18:38.747]  I've committed to do that.
[02:18:38.747 --> 02:18:39.827]  I've prayed for that.
[02:18:39.827 --> 02:18:41.468]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:18:41.468 --> 02:18:43.889]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:18:44.389 --> 02:18:45.529]  I will never falter.
[02:18:45.529 --> 02:18:48.050]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:18:48.050 --> 02:18:48.991]  I physically will.
[02:18:48.991 --> 02:18:56.193]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, and fullwrestler.com to give you my absolute total commitment.
[02:18:56.193 --> 02:19:04.596]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck even take your dog for a walk.
[02:19:04.596 --> 02:19:05.036]  Believe me.
[02:19:05.416 --> 02:19:06.036]  I know.
[02:19:06.036 --> 02:19:10.738]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:19:10.738 --> 02:19:15.980]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarestore.com, I still have that energy.
[02:19:15.980 --> 02:19:30.206]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive
[02:19:30.586 --> 02:19:36.648]  To get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.
[02:19:36.648 --> 02:19:40.629]  So go to Infowarsstore.com and get Supermail Vitality before it's gone.
[02:19:40.629 --> 02:19:44.310]  This is actually our last run of Supermail Vitality.

[02:19:59.238 --> 02:20:21.028]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:21.028 --> 02:20:21.928]  Here's an announcement.
[02:20:23.223 --> 02:20:25.283]  War Room 3 to 6 is going to be covering this.
[02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:27.504]  Tonight, 8 to 10, we're doing live election coverage.
[02:20:27.504 --> 02:20:28.664]  We'll have the latest.
[02:20:28.664 --> 02:20:30.785]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:20:30.785 --> 02:20:35.006]  Some of our radio and TV stations do cover our live election coverage and breaking news coverage.
[02:20:35.006 --> 02:20:42.287]  It goes right through the election and for about a week after, we're going to launch a new show, 7 to 10, Central Weeknight.
[02:20:42.287 --> 02:20:46.668]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL, ordinance expert, best-selling author, is riding shotgun for this segment.
[02:20:46.668 --> 02:20:48.108]  A little bit more of the next.
[02:20:48.108 --> 02:20:49.969]  We've got a press conference from the FBI.
[02:20:51.249 --> 02:20:53.031]  Supposedly come up in about 10 minutes.
[02:20:53.031 --> 02:20:53.892]  We'll see what they have to say.
[02:20:53.892 --> 02:20:56.655]  If there's anything new there, we'll cover some of that.
[02:20:56.655 --> 02:21:02.040]  We're taking calls from former ordinance experts or current ordinance experts, people that work for the military or the police.
[02:21:02.040 --> 02:21:05.924]  They've all been making really, really great points and in unison aren't buying what's happening.
[02:21:05.924 --> 02:21:10.229]  But I'll say this, we're getting a bunch of calls saying, hey, we live in Florida.
[02:21:11.587 --> 02:21:23.641]  And you can't have thick tent on vans or anything, which I know Florida has even stronger laws than Texas, because I've been driving through Florida before, and, you know, no folks have had problems from Texas there with darker tent.
[02:21:23.641 --> 02:21:28.107]  This guy had all the windows except the windshield covered in perfect wraps.
[02:21:29.466 --> 02:21:35.891]  That fit exactly into it, except for the two front windows, the side windows, and the windshield.
[02:21:35.891 --> 02:21:39.854]  And again, some of these are perfect wraps.
[02:21:39.854 --> 02:21:42.576]  This whole thing just looks ridiculous.
[02:21:42.576 --> 02:21:48.661]  So you get your car vandalized, any of this, it's just the whole thing looks synthetic.
[02:21:48.661 --> 02:21:52.504]  Matt, I want to go to Vox and their callers and get your take on what they have to say.
[02:21:55.031 --> 02:21:56.072]  We're 11 days out.
[02:21:56.072 --> 02:21:56.972]  We knew this was coming.
[02:21:56.972 --> 02:21:59.954]  The media hyping that we were going to cause violence against them.
[02:21:59.954 --> 02:22:04.537]  Their number one story for six months was so obvious that they were pre-programming.
[02:22:04.537 --> 02:22:06.739]  And I'm really concerned that they're just beta testing with this.
[02:22:06.739 --> 02:22:13.924]  And if we buy this, and if this looks successful, they're going to pull a real false flag, not one with fake bombs.
[02:22:13.924 --> 02:22:17.426]  Yeah, there's there's no way this is having the intended effect.
[02:22:17.426 --> 02:22:20.568]  My wife, I already voted by mail.
[02:22:20.568 --> 02:22:24.851]  My wife voted today, and it's the same story they're talking about on local radio.
[02:22:25.532 --> 02:22:31.037]  She had to wait more than an hour where normally, you know, you walk in for a midterm election, you're in and out in a minute.
[02:22:31.037 --> 02:22:37.883]  And people are saying they haven't seen anything like this in 30 years, including 2016 presidential election.
[02:22:37.883 --> 02:22:40.426]  And it's all people that are pissed off that are Republicans.
[02:22:41.129 --> 02:22:44.531]  So I think that this is so obvious.
[02:22:44.531 --> 02:22:47.593]  Those wraps in the windows, the guy didn't make that at home.
[02:22:47.593 --> 02:22:51.616]  He had to go to a printer that has a large format machine.
[02:22:51.616 --> 02:22:55.958]  He might have done the work on his computer, but a printer had to create those.
[02:22:55.958 --> 02:22:59.781]  And the FBI, I'm sure, knows who printed them and when.
[02:22:59.781 --> 02:23:07.946]  If they were created in the last two weeks, it's going to look pretty obvious that it was part of the entire hoax pipe bomb scheme.
[02:23:09.100 --> 02:23:13.783]  Not something organic that the guy's been putting on year over year.
[02:23:13.783 --> 02:23:17.465]  We've all seen these campers and vans covered with stickers.
[02:23:17.465 --> 02:23:25.789]  They're one on top of the other, they're faded, they're peeling because they go on as the guy gets struck by a new bumper sticker to stick on top.
[02:23:26.289 --> 02:23:27.730]  This is deliberate.
[02:23:27.730 --> 02:23:29.212]  This was professionally printed.
[02:23:29.212 --> 02:23:31.714]  Well it is, but let's expand on that.
[02:23:31.714 --> 02:23:37.739]  Why would any Trump supporter, conservatives, libertarians, Christians, we're not into violence offensively.
[02:23:37.739 --> 02:23:43.403]  That's not in the EMO, other than the fake Oklahoma City, which again was Holder and the rest of them, we know.
[02:23:43.403 --> 02:23:53.311]  Why on earth would you, when we're winning, send this to Hillary and Bill and Obama and Holder and Soros and make them victims?
[02:23:53.311 --> 02:23:54.913]  It's the worst thing you could do!
[02:23:56.845 --> 02:23:58.546]  It's a false flag, including the van.
[02:23:58.546 --> 02:24:01.069]  I think that he intended to be caught.
[02:24:01.069 --> 02:24:05.773]  Part of the reason for his fake bombs not even having any gunpowder, for example.
[02:24:06.491 --> 02:24:12.695]  Is so that in court, in trial, he can claim he never had any intention or capability of harming anybody.
[02:24:12.695 --> 02:24:13.816]  That it was just a stunt.
[02:24:13.816 --> 02:24:16.418]  Exactly, and all he gets is six months in a lunatic asylum.
[02:24:16.418 --> 02:24:22.762]  He did it in Broward County, where they have this whole thing, if you're a quota minority, you can commit all these crimes and they let you go.
[02:24:22.762 --> 02:24:23.703]  Absolutely.
[02:24:23.703 --> 02:24:29.307]  That's the missing link that Sheriff Israel of Coward County is in command.
[02:24:29.307 --> 02:24:30.288]  Right, but I'm sure that
[02:24:31.089 --> 02:24:43.219]  They'll know who is in and out in terms of lawyers, and if it's an ACLU lawyer or the firm that represented the Kavanaugh accusers, we'll know the fix is in there.
[02:24:43.219 --> 02:24:52.406]  But I think that the guy's going to come out to the arraignment and he's going to be shouting, you know, God bless Trump, I love Trump, Trump forever.
[02:24:52.406 --> 02:24:53.767]  It's all part of it for the next 12 days.
[02:24:54.918 --> 02:24:56.660]  I think it's going to have the reverse effect.
[02:24:56.660 --> 02:24:59.704]  The van is so obviously a bogus part of a false alarm.
[02:24:59.704 --> 02:25:00.705]  Well, I'll say this.
[02:25:00.705 --> 02:25:03.849]  Nobody I know buys that this whole thing's real.
[02:25:03.849 --> 02:25:05.010]  And now this just gets more ridiculous.
[02:25:05.010 --> 02:25:06.872]  Let's go to Vox in New York.
[02:25:06.872 --> 02:25:08.134]  I'm here with Matt Brack and Alex Jones.
[02:25:08.134 --> 02:25:10.236]  You're an aerospace engineer on the bombings.
[02:25:10.236 --> 02:25:13.921]  What do you think about not just the fake bombing and the fake bombs, but now this?
[02:25:15.342 --> 02:25:26.649]  Well, the thing I wanted to point out about these fake bombs being a political event, orchestrated for maximum political effect, is that it took them over three days to definitively declare these things fake.
[02:25:26.649 --> 02:25:35.314]  I mean, upon first glance, Alex, any competent intelligent agent or bomb experts would say, nope, no way.
[02:25:35.314 --> 02:25:42.578]  I mean, the LED thing, the dollar store LED device with a 1.5 volt watch battery doesn't have the kind of
[02:25:43.438 --> 02:25:49.222]  Uh, outputs, or even, uh, triggers, or gates, logic gates, didn't even do it.
[02:25:49.222 --> 02:25:56.387]  So, the fact that I have a difficult time accepting that it took them three days, uh, to tell us this, I mean, I certainly hope not.
[02:25:56.387 --> 02:25:58.668]  I mean, these guys are really dumb.
[02:25:58.668 --> 02:26:11.417]  Or they deliberately held this, uh, information for maximum political effect, which the latter, I think, is definitely the case, to give the Don Lemons and the Wolf Blitzes times to, to milk it, which is what they've been doing these last three days.
[02:26:13.178 --> 02:26:20.824]  Sure, it's a cheesy October surprise, and if this is the best they got, I mean, it's pretty bad, actually.
[02:26:20.824 --> 02:26:34.836]  No, I agree, it's a really cheesy October surprise, and that's why I'm really concerned that this is a distraction from something bigger, Matt, like you said, and I want to get Vox's take first, an attack on that caravan that just like
[02:26:36.209 --> 02:26:39.411]  James Woods and you and I predicted they wouldn't be on foot.
[02:26:39.411 --> 02:26:45.336]  They got trucks bringing them up right on time a few days before to claim some militia right winger shoots these folks.
[02:26:45.336 --> 02:26:47.197]  What do you think, Vox?
[02:26:47.197 --> 02:26:53.002]  Well, I'll tell you what I do think, that obviously it's staged, that one, too.
[02:26:53.002 --> 02:27:04.411]  And it's the Saul Alinsky, Gene Sharp technique of sort of roping your target, being Trump, into an untenable media position by having pregnant women and children up front.
[02:27:04.411 --> 02:27:04.811]  And then what?
[02:27:05.131 --> 02:27:05.451]  Yeah.
[02:27:20.285 --> 02:27:24.568]  That's why they've said, no I agree, Alinsky, you can't have borders, no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[02:27:24.568 --> 02:27:32.835]  And the good news is, Lou Dobbs, James Woods, it's not just Alex Jones now, it's Rush Limbaugh all saying this is a false flag, this is a stunt, it's fake, and everyone agrees.
[02:27:32.835 --> 02:27:42.262]  I think that's the real moment we've crossed here, Vox, is that now, and I like to say I'm becoming obsolete in a way, and that's why they've said all the news.
[02:27:42.262 --> 02:27:45.124]  The Republican Party has now been Alex Jones-icized.
[02:27:45.504 --> 02:27:46.044]  Well, no.
[02:27:46.044 --> 02:27:47.164]  You just met reality.
[02:27:47.164 --> 02:27:48.005]  It's not me.
[02:27:48.005 --> 02:27:49.645]  People are now having common sense.
[02:27:49.645 --> 02:27:51.005]  It's safer to say it now.
[02:27:51.005 --> 02:27:51.826]  Vox, great points.
[02:27:51.826 --> 02:27:52.166]  Thank you.
[02:27:52.166 --> 02:27:53.826]  Matt, comments on that?
[02:27:53.826 --> 02:27:59.728]  Yeah, the mainstream media is just catching up to where we've been for years.
[02:27:59.728 --> 02:28:03.369]  There's no doubt that they're milking the fake pseudo bombs.
[02:28:03.369 --> 02:28:11.511]  They're still carrying these things out in that containment truck, blocking off New York City traffic like it's a plutonium device.
[02:28:12.779 --> 02:28:13.479]  He's got it.
[02:28:30.148 --> 02:28:40.777]  Yeah, to evacuate buildings over it and then to have, you know, the helicopter views of, you know, six blocks of New York, you know, cordoned off with crime tape and cop cars.
[02:28:40.777 --> 02:28:44.099]  And Cuomo calling out the National Guard and breathlessly.
[02:28:44.099 --> 02:28:53.027]  It's so obvious, the breathless and the mayor of New York saying, these are real, these are dangerous, these are scary, they're real, they're real.
[02:28:53.027 --> 02:28:54.148]  You protest too much, buddy.
[02:28:55.472 --> 02:28:56.692]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.692 --> 02:29:00.593]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:00.593 --> 02:29:02.133]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:02.133 --> 02:29:05.094]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:05.094 --> 02:29:10.655]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:10.655 --> 02:29:11.855]  I can help you, too.
[02:29:11.855 --> 02:29:14.796]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.

[02:30:56.104 --> 02:30:58.465]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:30:58.465 --> 02:31:05.067]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids get their EPA and DHA too.

[02:31:52.945 --> 02:31:52.965]  X2.
[02:31:57.389 --> 02:32:02.212]  We were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and how much we were buying.
[02:32:02.212 --> 02:32:05.354]  And they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this and that.
[02:32:05.354 --> 02:32:07.355]  And so I've broken my contract.
[02:32:07.355 --> 02:32:12.178]  But right now, we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient that goes in X2.
[02:32:12.178 --> 02:32:17.802]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a peaker dish on top of a 90 degree hot plate, it gasses.
[02:32:17.802 --> 02:32:19.143]  Like I dream of Jeannie in this.
[02:32:19.143 --> 02:32:19.963]  It's purple gas.
[02:32:19.963 --> 02:32:23.405]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[02:32:23.405 --> 02:32:25.587]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but
[02:32:26.467 --> 02:32:31.610]  I bought a huge amount of it, ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down.
[02:32:31.610 --> 02:32:33.351]  I said, if you don't lower it, I'm done.
[02:32:33.351 --> 02:32:34.591]  I'm breaking the contract.
[02:32:34.591 --> 02:32:38.934]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[02:32:38.934 --> 02:32:44.236]  In fact, right now it is the last run of Survival Shield X2, and we've got a good supply of it.
[02:32:44.236 --> 02:32:46.197]  It'll be gone in a couple months.
[02:32:46.197 --> 02:32:48.919]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, InfoWarshore.com.

[02:33:11.313 --> 02:33:14.093]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:14.093 --> 02:33:17.654]  Broadcasting worldwide from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:17.654 --> 02:33:23.096]  Infowars.com is tomorrow's news today.
[02:33:23.096 --> 02:33:26.356]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:26.356 --> 02:33:31.718]  All right, Eagle Eye's been a trooper and been holding, but when you take funny calls at times, you kind of have to if you get in.
[02:33:31.718 --> 02:33:34.179]  And then we're going to go to everybody else that's holding.
[02:33:34.179 --> 02:33:34.959]  Matt Bracken's here.
[02:33:34.959 --> 02:33:35.519]  We're going to have the
[02:33:36.980 --> 02:33:37.720]  Press conference.
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:43.663]  I really want to hear what Sheriff Israel says, because that's a dangerous, sneaky, bad guy.
[02:33:43.663 --> 02:33:46.064]  Parkland happened, but not the way they said it did.
[02:33:46.064 --> 02:33:54.488]  And, you know, you got David Hogg in two videos saying he was at home when it happened, and then he wrote an hour to it, and then he's in a closet saying it's happening now.
[02:33:54.488 --> 02:33:58.790]  I mean, you know, just some weird stuff, man, and they don't want it questioned.
[02:33:58.790 --> 02:33:59.470]  And now this?
[02:33:59.470 --> 02:34:06.173]  Maybe we'll have a, you know, an event like this that's all weird every month or so, and it'll always be in his county.
[02:34:08.536 --> 02:34:20.502]  Carla Ray of an ABC affiliate, WFTV, reporting, I just obtained a 2002 arrest evident related to Cesar Seiko making a bomb threat.
[02:34:20.502 --> 02:34:24.865]  It states he called Florida Power and Light and said it would be worse than September 11th.
[02:34:24.865 --> 02:34:26.185]  And he got the report right there.
[02:34:26.185 --> 02:34:30.868]  And law enforcement says he was known to them in Florida and New York for making threats.
[02:34:32.128 --> 02:34:37.489]  You know, I mean, if I call up and said, if you turn my lights off, it'll be worse than September 11th, I should be arrested.
[02:34:37.489 --> 02:34:39.110]  That's a terrorist threat.
[02:34:39.110 --> 02:34:40.750]  Why are these people always allowed to do this?
[02:34:40.750 --> 02:34:43.511]  People like death threat me, and I've called the police, and they can't do anything.
[02:34:43.511 --> 02:34:45.791]  They go, oh, grand jury won't indict him.
[02:34:45.791 --> 02:34:48.852]  People saying, I'm gonna kill you.
[02:34:48.852 --> 02:34:50.412]  Well, we don't think it's a credible threat.
[02:34:50.412 --> 02:34:52.093]  Okay, fine, whatever.
[02:34:52.093 --> 02:34:54.193]  Matt Brackins with us here, riding shotgun.
[02:34:54.193 --> 02:34:56.874]  Let's go to Eagle Eye, Army Intelligence.
[02:34:56.874 --> 02:34:59.375]  Talks about the third missing component from Tennessee.
[02:34:59.375 --> 02:35:00.715]  What's your view on this situation?
[02:35:02.065 --> 02:35:12.795]  Well, I believe that strategically that this is the most important time frame for the Democrats and the globalists to try to take back some sort of control because of the election.
[02:35:12.795 --> 02:35:14.836]  It's all about the election.
[02:35:14.836 --> 02:35:26.427]  They're going to do anything that they can to distract, to intimidate, to fear, to threaten, to use terrorism to their advantage to try to affect voter turnout or whatever the case may be.
[02:35:27.245 --> 02:35:28.226]  I don't think so.
[02:35:48.277 --> 02:35:48.917]  I think so.
[02:36:05.563 --> 02:36:16.629]  Now that being said, you know, this could potentially be the time frame that they would have another 9-11 type event or something like that, but I don't believe that that's going to be allowed to happen.
[02:36:16.629 --> 02:36:19.730]  In my personal opinion, this is all about fear.
[02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:22.432]  This is all about keeping people away from the polls.
[02:36:22.432 --> 02:36:23.592]  Eagle Eye, I want to be clear.
[02:36:23.592 --> 02:36:27.714]  I agree, because they don't have full command and control anymore, and they know they're being watched.
[02:36:27.714 --> 02:36:32.377]  They know the public's wearing a false flag, so they're not willing to pull off an Oklahoma City like they did before.
[02:36:32.377 --> 02:36:33.057]  Thank you, Eagle Eye.
[02:36:33.057 --> 02:36:33.978]  Amazing points.
[02:36:33.978 --> 02:36:34.398]  Anything else?
[02:36:36.055 --> 02:36:37.756]  Just God bless you, and keep praying.
[02:36:37.756 --> 02:36:45.559]  I believe the veterans need to step up, take family members that are afraid, especially the elderly, anybody that's afraid of going out to vote.
[02:36:45.559 --> 02:36:50.261]  We've got family members that are veterans, such as myself, that are willing to take you out there and escort you.
[02:36:50.261 --> 02:36:51.041]  Don't be afraid.
[02:36:51.041 --> 02:36:51.762]  Get out and vote.
[02:36:51.762 --> 02:36:52.702]  Vote early.
[02:36:52.702 --> 02:36:53.902]  Don't wait until Election Day.
[02:36:53.902 --> 02:36:55.163]  It's key to vote early.
[02:36:55.163 --> 02:36:57.544]  Eagle Eye, you're absolutely right, and let me expand on that.
[02:36:59.733 --> 02:37:03.176]  My family has said, watch out when you go vote, have you voted yet?
[02:37:03.176 --> 02:37:08.340]  And everybody knows about Antifa, and they're out at parks with guns, not even letting people have conservative marches.
[02:37:08.340 --> 02:37:10.642]  I mean, this is where I live.
[02:37:10.642 --> 02:37:13.905]  This is going on, and it is intimidating conservative voters.
[02:37:13.905 --> 02:37:18.569]  We see record numbers turning out, but especially women, older folks, I agree.
[02:37:18.569 --> 02:37:28.116]  We need sons, daughters, even if you've got family that's five states away, you need to vote early where you're at, and get on a damn airplane, excuse my French, and get them to the polls.
[02:37:28.116 --> 02:37:28.557]  Matt Bracken?
[02:37:30.377 --> 02:37:37.504]  I think that these Democrat schemes, if you want to call them that, they would have worked ten years ago.
[02:37:37.504 --> 02:37:43.069]  And as we've been discussing in other shows, the liberals are still living in that world.
[02:37:43.069 --> 02:37:45.251]  They're in their insulated bubble.
[02:37:45.251 --> 02:37:48.494]  Going back to Dan Rather and the fake memo gate, that would have flown.
[02:37:48.494 --> 02:37:49.976]  That used to work.
[02:37:49.976 --> 02:37:53.219]  But now when they pull these tricks, especially coming after Kavanaugh,
[02:37:53.917 --> 02:37:57.340]  Americans have seen what the Democrats are capable of.
[02:37:57.340 --> 02:38:05.387]  When Trump at rallies says, you know, the Democrats are going to turn our country into Venezuela, it's not just hyperbole.
[02:38:05.387 --> 02:38:06.167]  People see it.
[02:38:06.167 --> 02:38:16.456]  They see Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and they see a Cesar Chavez and a Maduro, you know, that would... Oh, no, these are crazy, crazy power trippers.
[02:38:16.456 --> 02:38:18.197]  I totally, I totally agree.
[02:38:18.197 --> 02:38:21.040]  People now know how dangerous these folks are.
[02:38:21.834 --> 02:38:24.655]  The people that haven't voted in years are voting.
[02:38:24.655 --> 02:38:27.656]  They usually have under 30% turnout in Florida.
[02:38:27.656 --> 02:38:29.516]  It's over 60%.
[02:38:29.516 --> 02:38:31.617]  And it's running heavily Republican.
[02:38:31.617 --> 02:38:34.618]  Because people know that this is a make or break election.
[02:38:34.618 --> 02:38:40.399]  You know, even this fake bomb plot, I think it's going to backfire because it's so clumsy.
[02:38:40.399 --> 02:38:47.321]  There might be some real idiot liberals, the real NPC meme face people, might actually accept it at face value.
[02:38:47.321 --> 02:38:49.062]  But the rest of us see a false flag.
[02:38:49.622 --> 02:38:50.303]  Well, exactly.
[02:38:50.303 --> 02:38:56.106]  If they busted him, and the thing wasn't festooned with professional stickers, it's just all fake as hell.
[02:38:56.106 --> 02:39:01.690]  And then they're openly saying, we're gonna get killed, Trump's killing us, and then it magically happens, and then it's fake bombs.
[02:39:01.690 --> 02:39:03.711]  They wouldn't even mail themselves real bombs.
[02:39:03.711 --> 02:39:06.853]  I mean, it just shows how stupid they think we are.
[02:39:06.853 --> 02:39:09.155]  All right, let's go to some more callers here with Matt Bracken.
[02:39:09.155 --> 02:39:10.836]  Who's up next here?
[02:39:10.836 --> 02:39:11.876]  We got Matt in Texas.
[02:39:11.876 --> 02:39:12.737]  He's been on the longest.
[02:39:12.737 --> 02:39:13.818]  Jack in Canada.
[02:39:13.818 --> 02:39:14.638]  Jack, you're on the air.
[02:39:14.638 --> 02:39:14.958]  Go ahead.
[02:39:14.958 --> 02:39:15.439]  Thanks for holding.
[02:39:16.534 --> 02:39:22.715]  Hey, once again, tomorrow's news today on InfoWars.com.
[02:39:22.715 --> 02:39:25.496]  Yeah, you nailed it right on the head there, Alex.
[02:39:25.496 --> 02:39:27.156]  Absolutely.
[02:39:27.156 --> 02:39:28.357]  Well, let's be clear, though, brother.
[02:39:28.357 --> 02:39:35.158]  It's not hard when they're on every channel saying Trump and Alex Jones are going to bomb us and shoot us with no evidence of it, then it pops up right on time.
[02:39:35.158 --> 02:39:35.898]  I mean, it's not hard.
[02:39:35.898 --> 02:39:36.838]  Exactly.
[02:39:36.838 --> 02:39:37.318]  Exactly.
[02:39:37.318 --> 02:39:38.359]  It's not hard.
[02:39:38.359 --> 02:39:42.920]  But the thing is, you've got lots of people out there that actually believe in television.
[02:39:42.920 --> 02:39:43.580]  That's all they know.
[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:44.800]  They've been raised on television.
[02:39:45.473 --> 02:39:48.195]  Anything and everything that they've ever known has been on television.
[02:39:48.195 --> 02:39:50.577]  Like in the movie Network.
[02:39:50.577 --> 02:39:50.897]  Right?
[02:39:50.897 --> 02:39:53.079]  I mean... Tell them what to think.
[02:39:53.079 --> 02:39:53.960]  Tell them what to say.
[02:39:53.960 --> 02:39:54.700]  Exactly.
[02:39:54.700 --> 02:39:55.421]  Exactly.
[02:39:55.421 --> 02:39:56.161]  Exactly.
[02:39:56.161 --> 02:39:57.883]  And they eat it up.
[02:39:57.883 --> 02:40:06.449]  And when they censor you and you can't counterpoint anything, then people regurgitate the fake news.
[02:40:06.449 --> 02:40:08.191]  Like here in Canada.
[02:40:08.191 --> 02:40:13.535]  All our news agencies regurgitate all the fake news from the United States and repackage it.
[02:40:14.338 --> 02:40:15.378]  And sells it to us.
[02:40:15.378 --> 02:40:18.059]  I mean, they don't even mention about the caravan going on.
[02:40:18.059 --> 02:40:24.760]  Don't even mention about the connection with Adnan Khashoggi and his, I don't know if it's his brother or his cousin.
[02:40:24.760 --> 02:40:30.402]  And then you have the Khashoggi who got killed, who had links to ISIS, right?
[02:40:30.402 --> 02:40:32.402]  It just goes on and on and on.
[02:40:32.402 --> 02:40:35.883]  I mean, you see this thing with the van.
[02:40:35.883 --> 02:40:40.904]  You know what, when I saw that van, I went, wait a second, that is just too obvious.
[02:40:41.613 --> 02:40:45.094]  And for some weird reason, it reminded me of Las Vegas.
[02:40:45.094 --> 02:40:52.597]  I don't know why, but it just had that weird feel that it was just a Las Vegas-y thing about it.
[02:40:52.597 --> 02:40:56.119]  Oh, and notice, since we didn't buy Las Vegas, they shut that down real quick.
[02:40:56.119 --> 02:40:57.599]  Thank you for the call, Jack Redpoint.
[02:40:57.599 --> 02:41:00.580]  Go ahead.
[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:01.021]  Oh, he's gone.
[02:41:01.021 --> 02:41:01.921]  Sorry, I let you go too quick.
[02:41:03.001 --> 02:41:08.106]  Matt, I want to come back and just have you briefly, and I'll let you go, give us what the negative is, though.
[02:41:08.106 --> 02:41:16.473]  Because I agree with this show's, they admit, with exit polls and people that have been polled, that there's record numbers of Republicans turning out.
[02:41:16.473 --> 02:41:21.418]  They're turning out in the midterm like it is a general election.
[02:41:21.418 --> 02:41:23.500]  Every four years, but this is every two.
[02:41:23.500 --> 02:41:27.884]  So, A, what might they pull in the next three and a half days to stop this?
[02:41:27.884 --> 02:41:28.064]  And B,
[02:41:29.338 --> 02:41:31.599]  How could they grab victory from the jaws of defeat?
[02:41:31.599 --> 02:41:35.501]  And then what do they do when they lose big time, which all the numbers show?
[02:41:35.501 --> 02:41:37.222]  Because this is not a regular election.
[02:41:37.222 --> 02:41:44.706]  This is a political once in a three generation political realignment is what's happening right now.
[02:41:44.706 --> 02:41:46.487]  We're going to go to break.
[02:41:46.487 --> 02:41:47.707]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:41:47.707 --> 02:41:50.749]  Yeah, the last caller was saying it's it's like a Hollywood show.
[02:41:50.749 --> 02:41:51.389]  But you know what?
[02:41:51.389 --> 02:41:56.352]  People are hip to that to look at the movie shooter based on point of impact.
[02:41:56.352 --> 02:41:58.953]  The whole idea of Patsy's and black and false flags.
[02:41:59.491 --> 02:42:01.192]  It's mainstream now.
[02:42:01.192 --> 02:42:04.534]  You know, people, when they see that van, they laugh.
[02:42:04.534 --> 02:42:06.015]  So I don't think it's going to have the effect.
[02:42:06.015 --> 02:42:09.257]  They're still living in the old days when they could manipulate us.
[02:42:09.257 --> 02:42:11.839]  We now are hip to false flags.
[02:42:11.839 --> 02:42:19.964]  We know this is a... And they couldn't help but make it all be perfectly wrapped and clean and popping, clearly in a production instead of like an old sticker or something.
[02:42:19.964 --> 02:42:21.205]  Because that would take something old.
[02:42:21.205 --> 02:42:22.306]  That would take some work.
[02:42:22.306 --> 02:42:24.547]  It's easy to get a new van and plaster all this on it.
[02:42:24.547 --> 02:42:25.408]  It's so lazy.
[02:42:26.904 --> 02:42:28.825]  Yeah, it's just too pat.
[02:42:28.825 --> 02:42:30.786]  It's the Acme Bomb Factory.
[02:42:30.786 --> 02:42:30.986]  All right.
[02:42:30.986 --> 02:42:35.768]  I want to just real quickly on the side, boom, boom, boom, what should we be looking at on our six?
[02:42:35.768 --> 02:42:40.109]  What happens if they lose big, which I believe they will unless there's massive election fraud, all the numbers show it.
[02:42:40.109 --> 02:42:42.550]  We are at ten and a half days from destiny.
[02:42:42.550 --> 02:42:43.211]  Stay with us.
[02:42:43.211 --> 02:42:44.351]  Matt Bracken's our guest.
[02:42:44.351 --> 02:42:45.091]  More people coming up.
[02:42:45.091 --> 02:42:47.512]  I'll host in the fourth hour, too, with Nick Megas joining us.
[02:42:47.512 --> 02:42:49.693]  And I will get to every caller that's on the board.
[02:42:49.693 --> 02:42:50.314]  Stay with us.

[02:42:55.353 --> 02:43:03.744]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[02:43:03.744 --> 02:43:05.206]  Believe me, I know.
[02:43:05.206 --> 02:43:09.913]  I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright lights every day.
[02:43:09.913 --> 02:43:12.977]  But thanks to super male vitality at Infowarstore.com.
[02:43:13.457 --> 02:43:15.139]  I still have that energy.
[02:43:15.139 --> 02:43:35.295]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[02:45:03.289 --> 02:45:09.393]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[02:45:09.393 --> 02:45:10.293]  Come to their door.
[02:45:10.293 --> 02:45:11.794]  I'm death, and they know it.
[02:45:11.794 --> 02:45:12.935]  I'm death of their system.
[02:45:13.055 --> 02:45:27.786]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products and we
[02:45:28.046 --> 02:45:33.990]  We are hurtling into the whole Christmas season, so it's a great time to take advantage of these super sales right now.
[02:45:33.990 --> 02:45:41.795]  Free shipping store-wide, 50% off on all the supplements, 35% off on the highest quality storable foods at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[02:45:41.795 --> 02:45:46.278]  You support the broadcast, and that lets us stand against the enemy, which infuriates them.
[02:45:46.278 --> 02:45:51.801]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters being huge InfoWare supporters?
[02:45:51.801 --> 02:45:52.862]  It scared them to death.
[02:45:52.862 --> 02:45:55.524]  That's why they want to extinguish us, but you won't let them!
[02:45:56.104 --> 02:46:01.126]  Please, tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your community, constantly, this is a censored show.
[02:46:01.126 --> 02:46:02.307]  They want to shut it down.
[02:46:02.307 --> 02:46:03.907]  Don't let them do it.
[02:46:03.907 --> 02:46:06.008]  InfoWars.com.
[02:46:06.008 --> 02:46:07.249]  We're in your hands.
[02:46:07.249 --> 02:46:21.135]  If you don't spread the word about InfoWars, if you don't spread the word about NewsWars.com, if you don't get the great Patriot t-shirts with all the beautiful designs, if you don't get the water filtration and air filtration that's the best out there, very low prices, if you don't get the great supplements, we won't be here.
[02:46:21.135 --> 02:46:21.835]  It's up to you.
[02:46:21.835 --> 02:46:24.336]  And you've been responding, you've been supporting, so I want to thank you.
[02:46:24.696 --> 02:46:27.758]  You're also getting really great products like X2, the last run of it.
[02:46:27.758 --> 02:46:28.879]  Secret 12, amazing.
[02:46:28.879 --> 02:46:30.481]  Vitamin B12, the highest quality.
[02:46:30.481 --> 02:46:32.462]  Brain Force Plus, now at 20% more.
[02:46:32.462 --> 02:46:37.126]  It's all 50% off at Infowarsstore.com and free shipping.
[02:46:37.126 --> 02:46:43.231]  But it's got to end by this weekend because so many of the great products are running low, like Knockout, the great sleep aid.
[02:46:43.231 --> 02:46:45.072]  Like Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[02:46:45.072 --> 02:46:46.433]  Nobody can get it at that price.
[02:46:46.433 --> 02:46:48.375]  But you are the folks that have stood with us.
[02:46:48.775 --> 02:46:52.160]  So it's a 360 win-win at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:52.821]  Please take action.
[02:46:52.821 --> 02:46:54.284]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:10.796 --> 02:47:13.597]  You know, folks, let's listen to a little bit of George Strait here.
[02:47:13.597 --> 02:47:16.158]  But I'm not making this about us.
[02:47:16.158 --> 02:47:18.679]  We are under attack all over the news right now.
[02:47:18.679 --> 02:47:19.059]  But that's okay.
[02:47:19.059 --> 02:47:22.080]  We knew it would happen.
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:23.420]  And maybe I'll cover that more tomorrow.
[02:47:23.420 --> 02:47:24.800]  I'm going to go live at 3 p.m.
[02:47:24.800 --> 02:47:25.781]  tomorrow.
[02:47:25.781 --> 02:47:30.482]  And I'm going to broadcast as long as we need to on the election, on the stage terror, on all of it.
[02:47:30.482 --> 02:47:38.585]  And you can know this, if a big truck bomb goes off or nerve gas gets released or somebody shoots up a government building or a CNN headquarters,
[02:47:40.390 --> 02:47:46.012]  You just go to InfoWars.com, and within 30 minutes of it happening, I'll be on air.
[02:47:46.012 --> 02:47:46.392]  Know that.
[02:47:46.392 --> 02:47:49.954]  If I have to broadcast 24 hours a day, we're gonna be here.
[02:47:49.954 --> 02:47:53.415]  They try to censor us and block us, we'll just work twice as hard.
[02:47:53.415 --> 02:48:04.220]  But that's why, during a crisis, we always post an article and send it out to everybody that has the Droid and Apple app, because even though we had millions and millions of people that got on it in a month when they banned us,
[02:48:05.171 --> 02:48:06.892]  You still have it on your phone.
[02:48:06.892 --> 02:48:07.952]  So you get the alerts.
[02:48:07.952 --> 02:48:18.497]  So it's key for you to then email and text message everybody you know, saying, hey, we're broadcasting the truth that the enemy, that the globalists want censored because we are the real voice of America.
[02:48:18.497 --> 02:48:23.319]  The globalists actually recognize that and are trying to stop us.
[02:48:23.319 --> 02:48:24.180]  Now, I didn't see it.
[02:48:24.180 --> 02:48:25.300]  Everybody's calling about it.
[02:48:25.300 --> 02:48:26.941]  And I guess Trump's live on C-SPAN.
[02:48:28.348 --> 02:48:34.474]  And he's interviewing young black conservatives and our own Will Johnson's there talking about Infowars, Infowars censorship.
[02:48:34.474 --> 02:48:36.996]  So that'll be coming up later too.
[02:48:36.996 --> 02:48:44.482]  And we're trying to make it front and center for the president to talk about that and to understand that censorship is the key.
[02:48:44.482 --> 02:48:48.546]  And I know he understands that we've got to really push that through the next level.
[02:48:48.546 --> 02:48:50.288]  But here's some of the articles.
[02:48:50.288 --> 02:48:52.269]  They call it the Alex Jonesification.
[02:48:53.766 --> 02:48:55.627]  Of the right wing?
[02:48:55.627 --> 02:48:57.468]  No, it's not that, it's the common sense.
[02:48:57.468 --> 02:48:58.849]  Here's another one, Weekly Standard.
[02:48:58.849 --> 02:49:00.890]  The children of Alex Jones.
[02:49:00.890 --> 02:49:02.992]  Oh my God, the evil Candace Owens.
[02:49:02.992 --> 02:49:06.694]  She dare questions the motive of these bombings and how they're fake.
[02:49:06.694 --> 02:49:08.875]  I mean, that's just common sense.
[02:49:08.875 --> 02:49:15.579]  So they're all over the news freaking out that we dare to be questioning things.
[02:49:15.579 --> 02:49:18.961]  What do you expect them to pull next, Matt, because people aren't buying this?
[02:49:20.891 --> 02:49:25.873]  I don't think that there's going to be any kind of a directive that goes down, you know, that's passed down.
[02:49:25.873 --> 02:49:29.755]  This is, again, at that, like, insect hive pheromone level.
[02:49:29.755 --> 02:49:36.217]  But, you know, I think the panic is setting in as they realize there's no blue wave and it might even be a red wave.
[02:49:36.217 --> 02:49:39.499]  So I think that... Hold on, we're going to come right back to you.
[02:49:39.499 --> 02:49:41.740]  They've started the press conference 19 minutes late.
[02:49:41.740 --> 02:49:43.200]  Stay there, Matt Bracken and callers.
[02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:44.401]  Let's see what Sessions is saying.
[02:49:44.401 --> 02:49:46.962]  Media outlet, a Hollywood actor.
[02:49:47.449 --> 02:49:47.689]  I think?
[02:50:06.140 --> 02:50:10.943]  So we never see sessions until it's butt-kissing Democrats?
[02:50:10.943 --> 02:50:11.604]  No, no, we agree.
[02:50:11.604 --> 02:50:12.444]  We're not for violence.
[02:50:12.444 --> 02:50:13.365]  They're the ones that are.
[02:50:25.334 --> 02:50:30.000]  But we peaceably and lawfully comply with the results.
[02:50:30.000 --> 02:50:40.432]  Please know that from the beginning, this investigative team has made this matter a top priority, focusing their great talents... We're going to go back to this in a minute.
[02:50:40.432 --> 02:50:41.593]  I can't listen to it.
[02:50:41.593 --> 02:50:42.714]  Yes, it's illegal.
[02:50:42.714 --> 02:50:43.655]  We have a law.
[02:50:43.655 --> 02:50:44.456]  Violence is wrong.
[02:50:45.637 --> 02:50:46.978]  It's major, and I can't believe
[02:51:08.626 --> 02:51:10.127]  Yeah, they rolled Sessions out for this.
[02:51:10.127 --> 02:51:11.067]  Where's he been?
[02:51:11.067 --> 02:51:12.488]  Is he on life support somewhere?
[02:51:12.488 --> 02:51:15.189]  Oh, he's like a blue moon.
[02:51:15.189 --> 02:51:16.529]  He like pops up once a year.
[02:51:16.529 --> 02:51:18.410]  Yeah.
[02:51:18.410 --> 02:51:31.055]  I think we could possibly see a lone actor with a gun do another Scalise-type operation, or instead of yelling at somebody in a restaurant, it could be a gun.
[02:51:31.055 --> 02:51:35.377]  But the most effect, that would just be out of anger and counterproductive to the left.
[02:51:36.932 --> 02:51:43.817]  But the most effective thing would be a shooting against a liberal crowd with right-wing literature left.
[02:51:43.817 --> 02:51:48.320]  See, the good thing about the fake pipe bomb is it happened, you know, two weeks out.
[02:51:48.320 --> 02:51:57.126]  If just four or five days before an election, a liberal crowd is shot up and right-wing literature is left, you know, that's going to be more effective.
[02:51:57.126 --> 02:52:04.791]  Now, the only saving grace here is, thanks to Infowars and, you know, people like, you know, writers like me with my novels,
[02:52:05.424 --> 02:52:10.050]  People are way hipper to the false flag today and they just aren't going to accept it.
[02:52:20.704 --> 02:52:38.530]  91 Theft, 94 Domestic Violence, 03 Bomb Threat, 04 Illegal ID, 04 Controlled Substance, 04 Evidence Tampering, 09 Foreclosure, 09 Operating Without a License, 13 Theft, 13 Battery, 14 Theft, 15 Prohibition Violation, plus many Traffic and Drug Arrests.
[02:52:38.530 --> 02:52:46.072]  This guy is the perfect, patsy, shut up guy, promised to deal by Coward County Mafia.
[02:52:46.072 --> 02:52:48.213]  I mean, this guy pits the M.O.
[02:52:49.895 --> 02:52:52.297]  Yeah, he's perfect.
[02:52:52.297 --> 02:52:56.862]  A lot will be determined by what happens with his social media history.
[02:52:56.862 --> 02:53:05.310]  If they can recover his old social media, and it's 180 degrees out from his newly established social media, that'll be a clue right there.
[02:53:05.310 --> 02:53:07.312]  But if all of this happened in the last month,
[02:53:07.907 --> 02:53:14.295]  Then it'll look more like somebody got a handle on him and is just out and out using him.
[02:53:14.295 --> 02:53:19.262]  He might have enough priors to send him away and he's willing to do anything.
[02:53:19.262 --> 02:53:23.127]  They might have caught him in the middle of another scam and they've offered him a way out of it.
[02:53:24.525 --> 02:53:26.186]  All right, thank you so much, Matt Bracken.
[02:53:26.186 --> 02:53:27.847]  We'll talk to you again very soon.
[02:53:27.847 --> 02:53:31.228]  I'm going to host a little bit in the next hour to go to Greg and Matt and Aaron and Jeff and Garrett.
[02:53:31.228 --> 02:53:33.910]  I'll get to all of you and then we have a special guest joining us.
[02:53:33.910 --> 02:53:36.211]  But right now, Director Ray is out here.
[02:53:36.211 --> 02:53:37.451]  Let's hear what he has to say for the FBI.
[02:53:37.451 --> 02:53:41.273]  Questions about his background or about his motive?
[02:53:41.273 --> 02:53:45.996]  What I can say is that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope
[02:53:46.656 --> 02:53:48.658]  And of the greatest importance.
[02:53:48.658 --> 02:53:51.961]  Our investigation ranged from New York... The greatest importance!
[02:53:51.961 --> 02:53:58.827]  ...to Delaware, to Maryland, to the District of Columbia, to Florida, to California.
[02:53:58.827 --> 02:54:12.120]  And as it always does, the FBI responded with every resource we've got, including our Joint Terrorism Task Forces, our Counterterrorism Division, and our world-renowned experts at the FBI lab... World-renowned experts?
[02:54:14.064 --> 02:54:19.328]  But, and I really can't underscore this enough, we did not act alone.
[02:54:19.328 --> 02:54:21.710]  The FBI Crime Lab is famous for framing people.
[02:54:21.710 --> 02:54:23.952]  It is full of leftists.
[02:54:23.952 --> 02:54:30.697]  A threat of this scope and of this magnitude requires all of us working shoulder to shoulder.
[02:54:30.697 --> 02:54:31.658]  I can't listen, turn it off.
[02:54:31.658 --> 02:54:35.320]  A threat of this scope and this magnitude.
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:39.444]  Can we queue up the police commissioner saying there was no real powder in the bombs?
[02:54:39.444 --> 02:54:40.965]  These were not bombs!
[02:54:44.107 --> 02:54:48.210]  We put these joke road flares together because they're more dangerous than a road flare.
[02:54:48.210 --> 02:54:50.091]  If you lit one, you could burn a building down.
[02:54:50.091 --> 02:54:58.676]  These are more dangerous than the crap, the crap, the crap that was mailed out.
[02:54:58.676 --> 02:55:05.140]  This is, and he sits up there, this is the gravest danger, like a nuclear weapon's missing or something.
[02:55:05.140 --> 02:55:05.981]  I mean, just all of it.
[02:55:05.981 --> 02:55:11.404]  He should be up there saying, no one's in danger, these are fake, like the New York Commissioner did.
[02:55:11.404 --> 02:55:12.225]  Or like, but no!
[02:55:14.212 --> 02:55:16.974]  Or other FBI agents that have been all over Fox News saying this is fake.
[02:55:16.974 --> 02:55:17.994]  No.
[02:55:17.994 --> 02:55:18.575]  He's up there.
[02:55:18.575 --> 02:55:20.036]  This is the greatest threat.
[02:55:20.036 --> 02:55:21.557]  This is deadly dangerous.
[02:55:21.557 --> 02:55:22.197]  Oh my God.
[02:55:22.197 --> 02:55:24.779]  It's the worst thing we've ever seen in our life.
[02:55:24.779 --> 02:55:27.400]  Here, let's hear more of this garbage.
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:37.546]  It's known as energetic material, which is essentially potential explosives and material that give off heat and energy through a reaction to heat shock.
[02:55:37.546 --> 02:55:41.569]  They're now having to explain there was no powder, but it had potentially energetic material.
[02:55:47.328 --> 02:55:51.849]  I want to focus for a moment on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI lab.
[02:55:51.849 --> 02:55:55.211]  And then look, this guy looks like he's an MS-13 member.
[02:55:55.211 --> 02:56:04.174]  They uncovered a latent fingerprint from one of the envelopes containing an IED that had been sent to Congresswoman Maxine Waters.
[02:56:04.174 --> 02:56:05.555]  It was not an IED.
[02:56:05.555 --> 02:56:08.656]  This fingerprint is that of Cesar Sayoc.
[02:56:09.571 --> 02:56:10.431]  Turn it off.
[02:56:10.431 --> 02:56:11.772]  Just turn it off.
[02:56:11.772 --> 02:56:13.473]  I'm gonna go to break, come back right back with your calls.
[02:56:13.473 --> 02:56:22.698]  Ending this hour, don't forget, free shipping store-wide, 50% off, biggest sale ever, without your purchases, without your support, we will not be able to continue.
[02:56:22.698 --> 02:56:26.100]  You hear sponsors on the radio, you hear sponsors on local stations, support them.
[02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:27.700]  That's great.
[02:56:27.700 --> 02:56:38.246]  We're almost exclusively funded by you getting t-shirts, books, water filtration, air filtration, and you know they've been trying to shut us down, so I said, I got the product we've got through Christmas, I want to sell it all now.
[02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:45.806]  And all the big sales we had for Black Friday and for Christmas and for Cyber Monday, I said, let's just do them all now.
[02:56:45.806 --> 02:56:46.827]  And they've been successful.
[02:56:46.827 --> 02:56:49.510]  We've sold a lot of product, but we haven't made much profit on each thing.
[02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:53.395]  But I had to get it out of our warehouse in case they took our payment processors.
[02:56:53.395 --> 02:56:55.137]  They took five of our six.
[02:56:55.137 --> 02:56:56.558]  We now have two backups.
[02:56:57.583 --> 02:56:59.124]  Doesn't mean we're totally out of the woods.
[02:56:59.124 --> 02:57:04.189]  We got contracts this time that they won't discriminate us for our political activities or lies in the media.
[02:57:04.189 --> 02:57:06.111]  So that'll really upset George Soros in media matters.
[02:57:06.111 --> 02:57:08.433]  But the sales have to end.
[02:57:08.433 --> 02:57:09.894]  The sales have to end.
[02:57:09.894 --> 02:57:11.756]  Especially on Brain Force.
[02:57:11.756 --> 02:57:12.837]  It's selling out.
[02:57:12.837 --> 02:57:13.717]  Especially on X2.
[02:57:13.717 --> 02:57:14.718]  It's the last run of that.
[02:57:14.718 --> 02:57:18.382]  We were unable to secure more of it, but I have a little trick up my sleeve you'll hear about next week.
[02:57:18.982 --> 02:57:21.725]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, it's all there.
[02:57:21.725 --> 02:57:31.794]  More than 70 great supplements, great water filtration, great air filtration, 35% off the highest quality swearable food, and so much more at infowarestore.com.
[02:57:31.794 --> 02:57:37.139]  And you go in there and get the great products you already need, funds the operation, and literally, we are in your hands.
[02:57:37.139 --> 02:57:39.901]  When you support us, you allow us to continue.
[02:57:39.901 --> 02:57:41.303]  Without you, we are nothing.
[02:57:41.303 --> 02:57:44.085]  You are the dreaded InfoWar.
[02:57:44.085 --> 02:57:44.606]  We'll be back!
[02:57:45.246 --> 02:57:51.729]  We are kept afloat only by your loyal patronage, and that's why we need you to go to the site now.
[02:57:51.729 --> 02:57:58.552]  If you're not in the market for one of our greatest nutraceuticals, please consider a contribution.
[02:57:58.552 --> 02:58:14.100]  $25, $50, $100, $250 or even $500 would be a godsend to our important work here to beat back the globalists and to destroy their campaign of censorship in which they want to strangle our First Amendment rights.
[02:58:15.242 --> 02:58:19.083]  Hey, how would you like to take InfoWars with you wherever you go?
[02:58:19.083 --> 02:58:24.305]  Well, now you can do just that with the new official InfoWars app.
[02:58:24.305 --> 02:58:25.606]  And here's the best part.
[02:58:25.606 --> 02:58:27.446]  It is absolutely free.
[02:58:27.446 --> 02:58:32.668]  At the Apple Store and Google Play, you can join the InfoWars today.
[02:58:32.668 --> 02:58:36.609]  Check it out right now at InfoWars.com forward slash app app.
[02:58:36.609 --> 02:58:40.731]  It's the InfoWars official app taken on the globalist at point blank range.
[02:58:40.731 --> 02:58:44.832]  And with your help spreading it and with your help downloading it, we are unstoppable.
[02:58:46.727 --> 02:58:50.969]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship.
[02:58:50.969 --> 02:58:54.450]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[02:58:54.450 --> 02:58:56.210]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[02:58:56.210 --> 02:58:59.472]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[02:58:59.472 --> 02:59:06.254]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[02:59:06.254 --> 02:59:11.336]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[02:59:11.696 --> 02:59:17.801]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:59:17.801 --> 02:59:20.424]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[02:59:20.424 --> 02:59:21.885]  I want to keep going.
[02:59:21.885 --> 02:59:25.708]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[02:59:25.708 --> 02:59:27.730]  I want to push all the way.
[02:59:27.730 --> 02:59:29.011]  I've committed to do that.
[02:59:29.011 --> 02:59:30.092]  I've prayed for that.
[02:59:30.092 --> 02:59:31.733]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[02:59:31.733 --> 02:59:34.676]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[02:59:34.676 --> 02:59:35.997]  I will never falter.
[02:59:35.997 --> 02:59:38.319]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[02:59:38.319 --> 02:59:38.940]  I physically will.
[02:59:39.560 --> 02:59:49.763]  I give you my commitment, if you financially support us, InfoWareStore.com, to give you my absolute, total commitment.
[02:59:49.763 --> 02:59:59.366]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:59.366 --> 03:00:01.766]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:01.766 --> 03:00:03.147]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.027 --> 03:00:12.369]  Well, even CNN had analysts on saying the false flag theory could be real.
[03:00:12.369 --> 03:00:13.790]  I mean, obviously, who stands to gain?
[03:00:13.790 --> 03:00:17.752]  People get caught all the time doing things politically to themselves to blame their enemy.
[03:00:17.752 --> 03:00:21.513]  That's as old as humanity.
[03:00:21.513 --> 03:00:26.096]  But there's literally hundreds of articles out saying I'm a horrible, mean person and I'm bad.
[03:00:26.096 --> 03:00:31.478]  But the good news is most people, even some of the crew, are more socially liberal, but they're patriots.
[03:00:31.478 --> 03:00:32.919]  They like the show.
[03:00:32.919 --> 03:00:34.900]  I don't think people will be total right-wingers to work here.
[03:00:34.900 --> 03:00:37.221]  And they're like, oh yeah, none of my liberal friends
[03:00:38.274 --> 03:00:40.375]  You know, buy into any of this.
[03:00:40.375 --> 03:00:41.576]  They just say it all looks fake.
[03:00:41.576 --> 03:00:45.778]  People just know synthetic when they see it.
[03:00:45.778 --> 03:00:49.900]  To quote Dick Carlson, they smell it.
[03:00:49.900 --> 03:00:51.180]  And it's happening.
[03:00:51.180 --> 03:00:55.062]  All right, we got Greg, Tommy, Matt, Aaron, Jeff, and Garrett.
[03:00:55.062 --> 03:01:02.566]  I'll get to these before the amazing, and I mean amazing, guest joins us, Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:01:02.566 --> 03:01:05.287]  Right now, who's been holding the longest here?
[03:01:05.287 --> 03:01:06.708]  Aaron in Florida!
[03:01:07.922 --> 03:01:10.004]  A former Navy on the topic of the bomber.
[03:01:10.004 --> 03:01:10.765]  What is your take?
[03:01:10.765 --> 03:01:11.805]  I'm going to go to Greg in Iowa.
[03:01:11.805 --> 03:01:13.407]  Go ahead.
[03:01:13.407 --> 03:01:13.867]  Yes, sir.
[03:01:13.867 --> 03:01:16.109]  Thank you for taking my call.
[03:01:16.109 --> 03:01:24.996]  I've been listening now for the last hour and a half, maybe two hours, and all the guys ahead of me have made fantastic points, kind of stole my thunder, so I won't waste a lot of your time.
[03:01:24.996 --> 03:01:28.619]  I want to let you know that there are supporters out here, millions and millions of us.
[03:01:28.619 --> 03:01:35.084]  You know, we believe, we're smart, we understand what's going on, we see what's going on.
[03:01:35.084 --> 03:01:36.225]  We're putting two and two together.
[03:01:39.072 --> 03:01:50.480]  We thank you for what you're doing and just a quick shout out to the Oath Keepers who are also working in North Florida helping people get recovered from the hurricane.
[03:01:50.480 --> 03:01:54.803]  I mean I wish I had more but you know the former callers have covered everything very well.
[03:01:55.492 --> 03:01:56.353]  So thank you very much.
[03:01:56.353 --> 03:01:57.273]  Keep up what you're doing.
[03:01:57.273 --> 03:01:57.713]  No, no.
[03:01:57.713 --> 03:01:58.394]  Thank you, brother.
[03:01:58.394 --> 03:02:04.838]  I know you got to go, Aaron, but real quick, just your approximation of this, of what everybody seems to think is a hoax.
[03:02:04.838 --> 03:02:08.880]  Do you think this is a win for the Democrats or a loss?
[03:02:08.880 --> 03:02:10.181]  I think it's a massive loss.
[03:02:10.181 --> 03:02:12.502]  I think it's going to drive Republicans out to the polls.
[03:02:12.502 --> 03:02:15.444]  You can already see it in Florida early voting.
[03:02:15.444 --> 03:02:19.426]  I think this is the dumbest thing they've ever tried to come up with.
[03:02:19.426 --> 03:02:22.568]  And a previous caller said, yes, this is all Hollywood.
[03:02:22.568 --> 03:02:23.429]  They're targeting
[03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:26.430]  People who sit on the couch and do nothing but watch TV.
[03:02:26.430 --> 03:02:28.151]  This is a made-for-TV event.
[03:02:28.151 --> 03:02:29.552]  Great points, Aaron.
[03:02:29.552 --> 03:02:38.878]  And, you know, here is Politico and all of them, New York Times, the Alex Jonesification of the right is now complete.
[03:02:38.878 --> 03:02:48.044]  Rush Limbaugh, all these other people, Lou Dobbs are saying the evidence is clear, it's a staged event.
[03:02:48.044 --> 03:02:49.145]  They don't know what to do.
[03:02:51.007 --> 03:02:51.727]  Yes, it's right.
[03:02:51.727 --> 03:02:54.908]  We don't trust you guys anymore, and we know your history.
[03:02:54.908 --> 03:02:56.109]  So get ready.
[03:02:56.109 --> 03:02:57.869]  We're not idiots.
[03:02:57.869 --> 03:02:59.370]  All right, let's talk to Greg in Iowa.
[03:02:59.370 --> 03:03:02.191]  He says he trains police and law enforcement.
[03:03:02.191 --> 03:03:05.452]  He's police, Army, Navy, Marines on explosives.
[03:03:05.452 --> 03:03:06.713]  Greg, thanks for holding.
[03:03:06.713 --> 03:03:09.594]  What's your take on this?
[03:03:09.594 --> 03:03:10.914]  Absolute training.
[03:03:10.914 --> 03:03:13.815]  Absolute fake.
[03:03:13.815 --> 03:03:19.297]  We've made stuff in training that look more real than this, and you could tell
[03:03:20.049 --> 03:03:21.069]  That this was made.
[03:03:21.069 --> 03:03:32.293]  I mean, seriously, you can't just send something through the mail like that and not get picked up by the scanners, get picked up by the train staff, especially after 9-11.
[03:03:32.293 --> 03:03:42.616]  A canine dog gets sent in after a call of explosives or a suspicious package.
[03:03:42.616 --> 03:03:44.737]  It doesn't need a state-of-the-art
[03:03:49.705 --> 03:03:50.646]  Identification.
[03:03:50.646 --> 03:03:52.367]  A dog can pick out explosives.
[03:03:52.367 --> 03:03:53.387]  Well, here's an example.
[03:03:53.387 --> 03:04:02.512]  I tried to ship jelly in my check-in bags, and because a thing of jelly, grape jelly I got in Omaha, might have been an explosive, they took it.
[03:04:02.512 --> 03:04:05.494]  And there was a letter in my bag.
[03:04:05.494 --> 03:04:07.875]  And again, they think couriers brought this, though.
[03:04:07.875 --> 03:04:09.336]  And then, oh, that's another question.
[03:04:09.336 --> 03:04:11.217]  This guy's the new Speedy Gonzales.
[03:04:11.217 --> 03:04:18.120]  How did he deliver it magically, in some cases hand-delivered, to all these locations simultaneously?
[03:04:18.120 --> 03:04:18.581]  Yeah, right.
[03:04:21.010 --> 03:04:23.111]  It's just laughable.
[03:04:23.111 --> 03:04:28.273]  And in New York, with all the cameras, all the CCTVs they've got going on.
[03:04:28.273 --> 03:04:31.975]  One of my head instructors... Greg, don't hang up.
[03:04:31.975 --> 03:04:32.996]  You're not going to wait anymore.
[03:04:32.996 --> 03:04:34.136]  60 seconds, we're going to come back.
[03:04:34.136 --> 03:04:35.777]  One of your head instructors told you what?
[03:04:35.777 --> 03:04:36.637]  Stay there.
[03:04:36.637 --> 03:04:39.139]  And then, who do you think's behind this then?
[03:04:39.139 --> 03:04:40.499]  What were they thinking?
[03:04:40.499 --> 03:04:41.700]  Why is it so ham-fisted?
[03:04:43.832 --> 03:04:46.616]  And why do they hype these terror attacks for coming against the left?
[03:04:46.616 --> 03:04:48.338]  I mean, it's so scripted.
[03:04:48.338 --> 03:04:50.480]  It's so ridiculously fake.
[03:04:50.480 --> 03:04:54.305]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:54.305 --> 03:04:58.210]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:04:59.545 --> 03:05:08.228]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:05:08.228 --> 03:05:10.209]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:05:10.209 --> 03:05:13.670]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:05:13.670 --> 03:05:16.271]  And I knew we had no future, we didn't do this.
[03:05:16.271 --> 03:05:18.572]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:05:18.572 --> 03:05:25.515]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is, and why we've been made the main target,
[03:05:26.095 --> 03:05:35.861]  And if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:05:35.861 --> 03:05:37.042]  We'll win.
[03:05:37.042 --> 03:05:39.364]  We have huge sales at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[03:05:39.364 --> 03:05:45.287]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce.
[03:05:45.287 --> 03:05:47.109]  And you're right, to the market.
[03:05:47.109 --> 03:05:50.811]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globals may win.
[03:05:50.811 --> 03:05:52.352]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:05:52.352 --> 03:05:53.213]  We need your support.
[03:05:53.213 --> 03:05:53.773]  I'm counting on you.
[03:05:59.819 --> 03:06:07.741]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[03:06:07.741 --> 03:06:15.422]  Bombscare shows that Alex Jones' legacy is more conspiracy theories and more conspiracy theorists.
[03:06:15.422 --> 03:06:17.183]  That's the weekly standard.
[03:06:17.183 --> 03:06:24.104]  The Fresno Bee, the Associated Press, Mother Jones, Pathos, the New York Times.
[03:06:24.104 --> 03:06:25.484]  They're all saying, I'm gone.
[03:06:25.484 --> 03:06:26.605]  I don't exist anymore.
[03:06:26.605 --> 03:06:28.005]  They defeated me.
[03:06:28.005 --> 03:06:28.565]  I'm off air.
[03:06:29.926 --> 03:06:34.847]  But, I gave birth to Rush Limbaugh and Candace Owens.
[03:06:34.847 --> 03:06:37.407]  No, I didn't.
[03:06:37.407 --> 03:06:53.511]  This audience, you, I, Matt Drudge, people just covering Real News, we made it safe for other people to cover reality and question and not just believe false narratives were given over and over again.
[03:06:53.511 --> 03:06:54.891]  But it's the weirdest thing, it's like,
[03:06:56.718 --> 03:07:00.840]  The local paper, like, every day has articles, Alex Jones is gone now!
[03:07:00.840 --> 03:07:02.081]  Alex Jones was defeated!
[03:07:02.081 --> 03:07:05.962]  You see, the truth is, Alex Jones and this great audience, we got Trump elected.
[03:07:05.962 --> 03:07:07.703]  And the truth is, the country's coming back.
[03:07:07.703 --> 03:07:14.967]  And the truth is, we did amazing things, and you are heroes, as an audience, for taking action.
[03:07:14.967 --> 03:07:17.488]  And we've done heroic work here, this great crew.
[03:07:17.488 --> 03:07:21.270]  They're not gonna let everybody see how competent, and how smart, and what winners we are!
[03:07:21.270 --> 03:07:23.391]  They have to rebrand us as the failures!
[03:07:24.875 --> 03:07:28.937]  But now you see Rush Limbaugh.
[03:07:28.937 --> 03:07:31.759]  And everyone else.
[03:07:31.759 --> 03:07:35.121]  They must be taken off the air.
[03:07:35.121 --> 03:07:36.722]  Because now they're like Alex Jones.
[03:07:36.722 --> 03:07:38.143]  And well, we took him off.
[03:07:38.143 --> 03:07:40.764]  So now we take everyone else off.
[03:07:40.764 --> 03:07:43.626]  We can't let them question us.
[03:07:43.626 --> 03:07:45.447]  We can't let them do that.
[03:07:45.447 --> 03:07:46.527]  No.
[03:07:46.527 --> 03:07:50.650]  It's un-American to have speech.
[03:07:50.650 --> 03:07:51.050]  Look at this.
[03:07:51.050 --> 03:07:52.671]  The children of Alex Jones.
[03:07:53.703 --> 03:07:57.305]  Candace Owens and Rush Limbaugh.
[03:07:57.305 --> 03:08:00.568]  The condescension of that.
[03:08:00.568 --> 03:08:02.289]  False flag theory on pipe bombs.
[03:08:02.289 --> 03:08:03.129]  They're not bombs.
[03:08:03.129 --> 03:08:04.450]  The police say they're fake.
[03:08:04.450 --> 03:08:06.632]  Zooms from right-wing fringe to mainstream.
[03:08:06.632 --> 03:08:07.712]  New York Times.
[03:08:07.712 --> 03:08:09.313]  Oh, no!
[03:08:09.313 --> 03:08:11.215]  It came from Alex Jones!
[03:08:11.215 --> 03:08:13.796]  Oh, no!
[03:08:13.796 --> 03:08:15.458]  Hans Blix!
[03:08:15.458 --> 03:08:17.379]  Oh, no!
[03:08:17.379 --> 03:08:20.261]  Come on in, Hans Blix.
[03:08:20.261 --> 03:08:21.822]  Redrops him into the shark tank.
[03:08:26.897 --> 03:08:29.178]  I love the one line, it's true.
[03:08:29.178 --> 03:08:34.321]  The Alex Jonesification of the right is now complete.
[03:08:34.321 --> 03:08:39.484]  And I'm far from gone, and they know that.
[03:08:39.484 --> 03:08:41.185]  And it's not about a power trip.
[03:08:41.185 --> 03:08:53.652]  But when people are trying to destroy you, and have done everything they can to silence you, but the people stand by you, and you come through the storm battered but stronger, battle-hardened is the word, and just to see everything they're doing.
[03:08:54.471 --> 03:08:55.572]  We're going to win this thing.
[03:08:55.572 --> 03:09:04.217]  I don't know how hard it's going to be or how long it's going to go, but I used to say, I don't know how this is going to end, but if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[03:09:04.217 --> 03:09:10.621]  And now I can tell you, I don't know how it's going to end, but we're going to win.
[03:09:10.621 --> 03:09:12.902]  And I could really, at a gut level, tell you that.
[03:09:12.902 --> 03:09:17.945]  When Trump got elected that night, I was processing what we were going to have to go through, and I was shaken.
[03:09:19.175 --> 03:09:30.358]  But now, two years into the fight, I'm still shaken, but we're gonna win, and that really is what matters.
[03:09:30.358 --> 03:09:32.618]  That's a funny thing from that night.
[03:09:32.618 --> 03:09:33.839]  I've aged some, haven't I?
[03:09:33.839 --> 03:09:35.359]  But that's good, that's my struggle.
[03:09:35.359 --> 03:09:36.299]  I expect to age hard.
[03:09:36.299 --> 03:09:39.820]  I'm not trying to sit here and be a little pretty boy.
[03:09:39.820 --> 03:09:46.122]  I expect to spend my entire soul and will on the fight for a greater future for everybody, because we are the future.
[03:09:47.665 --> 03:09:51.527]  Alright, Greg in Iowa, thanks for holding while I was ranting.
[03:09:51.527 --> 03:10:02.633]  You were making some great points about this whole thing, saying it's just... Well, you heard the earlier caller that trained Post Office, he was saying it's literally the template of what a fake package looks like they're trying to discover.
[03:10:02.633 --> 03:10:07.936]  So it was meant to instantly be noticed once it even got to the mailroom at CNN.
[03:10:07.936 --> 03:10:09.017]  Right.
[03:10:09.017 --> 03:10:12.019]  Exactly.
[03:10:12.019 --> 03:10:15.741]  How did it even get through the mail system, if it even in doubt went through the mail system?
[03:10:16.428 --> 03:10:25.190]  See, in the military, we would even work with Hollywood, Camp Pendleton, Florida Irwin, other places.
[03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:33.532]  They would help us make our urban warfare places with fake IEDs.
[03:10:33.532 --> 03:10:44.854]  As an urban warfare instructor teaching house-to-house, room-to-room combat, they would make missiles, fake blood, fake wounds.
[03:10:45.407 --> 03:10:49.068]  Uh, Forest, they're special effects people.
[03:10:49.068 --> 03:10:59.051]  As a combat engineer, which I specialized in early on in my career, we would make fake explosives that looked even more real than this.
[03:10:59.051 --> 03:11:01.892]  But see, that's the problem.
[03:11:01.892 --> 03:11:10.614]  You may be able to, like in Bosnia where I did a lot of minefield clearing and such, do you think you may be able to spot a fake
[03:11:11.215 --> 03:11:14.577]  But when you think it's a fake, it may be real.
[03:11:14.577 --> 03:11:21.261]  Pennsylvania still can't account for 700 pounds of demolitions grade explosive.
[03:11:21.261 --> 03:11:26.063]  400 blasting caps that were stolen out of Lancaster County.
[03:11:26.063 --> 03:11:33.688]  So yes, this looks like a training device that is fake as a $3 bill.
[03:11:36.810 --> 03:11:40.732]  And so that shows it wasn't a lone kook that didn't know what he was doing, building it.
[03:11:40.732 --> 03:11:43.354]  It came from people involved in the system.
[03:11:43.354 --> 03:11:46.015]  God bless you, I appreciate your call.
[03:11:46.015 --> 03:11:48.436]  Really, really great points from these callers here.
[03:11:48.436 --> 03:11:54.300]  And it's the timing, it's the pre-programming, that Trump's violent, Alex Jones is violent, we're going to get the media killed.
[03:11:54.300 --> 03:11:55.180]  That's your biggest tell.
[03:11:55.180 --> 03:11:57.321]  Because we weren't doing that.
[03:11:57.321 --> 03:12:00.203]  And they were saying on every channel to get you ready for this point.
[03:12:01.445 --> 03:12:03.166]  To get you ready for this point.
[03:12:03.166 --> 03:12:04.846]  That's why you know it's fake.
[03:12:04.846 --> 03:12:07.067]  Then everything else is just gravy from that point on.
[03:12:07.067 --> 03:12:09.808]  It's ridiculous how fake it is.
[03:12:09.808 --> 03:12:11.948]  Okay, who's been holding along us now?
[03:12:11.948 --> 03:12:12.388]  Matt?
[03:12:12.388 --> 03:12:12.849]  No, no.
[03:12:12.849 --> 03:12:14.169]  Garrett in Pennsylvania.
[03:12:14.169 --> 03:12:14.609]  Then Matt.
[03:12:14.609 --> 03:12:15.790]  Garrett, thanks for holding.
[03:12:15.790 --> 03:12:18.090]  Dr. Nick Beggins is coming up.
[03:12:18.090 --> 03:12:19.131]  Alright, Alex.
[03:12:19.131 --> 03:12:26.453]  I just wanted to thank you guys for all that you're doing on InfoWormers and commend you for everything you guys are doing in the fight against globalization.
[03:12:27.425 --> 03:12:30.107]  I wanted to talk today about two different things.
[03:12:30.107 --> 03:12:33.629]  I wanted to talk about how this is obviously way too good to be true.
[03:12:33.629 --> 03:12:35.150]  You guys know that.
[03:12:35.150 --> 03:12:45.315]  And how society has become extremely numb to all of these negative things that we're force-fed with a fire hose every single day by the mainstream media.
[03:12:45.315 --> 03:12:46.616]  Obviously it's too good to be true.
[03:12:46.616 --> 03:12:49.938]  You guys have been saying it for the last three days.
[03:12:49.938 --> 03:12:51.819]  I see this happening
[03:12:52.632 --> 03:12:58.394]  Uh, more and more as times go on, but people are becoming numb and number and number to it.
[03:12:58.394 --> 03:13:04.436]  I'm a college student and I went to class a couple days ago and one of our professors said, what happened today?
[03:13:04.436 --> 03:13:09.538]  And then someone said, Oh, there were bomb threats to all these high level individuals.
[03:13:09.538 --> 03:13:14.840]  Well, the high level individuals were never affected and no one died and no one was injured.
[03:13:14.840 --> 03:13:16.681]  So what ended up happening was.
[03:13:17.944 --> 03:13:19.224]  Nobody in class commented.
[03:13:19.224 --> 03:13:21.305]  He's like, would anyone like to give their opinion?
[03:13:21.305 --> 03:13:34.569]  And not a single individual said that they were interested in giving their opinion because everyone's so numb to hearing all of the negative that comes out of the media.
[03:13:34.569 --> 03:13:36.870]  And again, the bombs weren't even bombs.
[03:13:36.870 --> 03:13:38.650]  They were fake.
[03:13:38.650 --> 03:13:39.711]  Right.
[03:13:39.711 --> 03:13:46.953]  All it is, is it's a giant, it's a giant hoax for people to believe that there's something negative that's going to happen.
[03:13:47.392 --> 03:14:02.539]  Now I believe that the worst thing that could happen is that they go to one of the major polling sites and actually touch a bomb off and kill or maim a lot of people or send someone who's extremely crazy to actually shoot up one of these polling stations.
[03:14:02.539 --> 03:14:05.521]  Oh I'm telling you, we're 11 days out and I just...
[03:14:06.485 --> 03:14:10.889]  Pray to get through this election, because you just know they're not going to stop.
[03:14:10.889 --> 03:14:14.092]  And I think this is a test to see how people buy it.
[03:14:14.092 --> 03:14:15.254]  Thank you so much, Garrett.
[03:14:15.254 --> 03:14:19.698]  All right, we got Jeff, Matt, and Tommy on the line, but you know, Dr. Nick Baggage is an amazing guy.
[03:14:19.698 --> 03:14:26.725]  He's got a full sled of things to cover, and I said I'd get to every call an hour ago, but those were new calls that got on early, except for Matt.
[03:14:27.848 --> 03:14:31.171]  I'm going to go live tomorrow at 3 p.m.
[03:14:31.171 --> 03:14:31.571]  at Infowars.com.
[03:14:31.571 --> 03:14:34.193]  We're going to put it out on the satellite as well.
[03:14:34.193 --> 03:14:34.693]  So 3 p.m.
[03:14:34.693 --> 03:14:36.775]  tomorrow central, you can tune in.
[03:14:36.775 --> 03:14:47.624]  If Matt, we get Matt's number, I'll call Matt back tomorrow, Tommy and Jeff, but I know they don't care about this, but all of them get a free t-shirt, get their address, get their name, ask what they want, and we'll send them a free t-shirt for holding.
[03:14:47.624 --> 03:14:48.664]  So I promise to get to everybody.
[03:14:49.625 --> 03:14:55.649]  It's just impossible, and I'm not going to take the rest of Dr. Nick Begich, researcher scientist's brother, former U.S.
[03:14:55.649 --> 03:15:03.095]  Senator, set to be the next governor, and his dad, famous congressman, really smart scientist, has exposed all the Big Brother systems and more.
[03:15:03.095 --> 03:15:13.762]  He's going to be coming on to give his perspective on all of this, and then in about 45 minutes, we're going to have the War Room with Owen Schroer, myself, I'm probably going to be popping in, and of course, Roger Stone and many others, and your calls.
[03:15:13.762 --> 03:15:19.026]  In fact, if Matt and Tommy and Jeff want to get their numbers to us, we will call them and get them in the War Room first.
[03:15:20.302 --> 03:15:21.923]  But regardless, free t-shirts.
[03:15:21.923 --> 03:15:23.204]  And that's something I never really plugged.
[03:15:23.204 --> 03:15:26.726]  It gets the word out, and is really a key part of the fight, is the great shirts.
[03:15:26.726 --> 03:15:31.149]  The best shirts we've ever produced, on so many great topics, at mfullmorestore.com.
[03:15:31.149 --> 03:15:32.390]  Your purchase makes it all possible.

[03:15:39.495 --> 03:15:41.896]  So please take advantage of that, and help support the MFUL War.
[03:15:41.896 --> 03:15:42.977]  We're only here because of you.
[03:15:42.977 --> 03:15:47.600]  We are literally in your hands, and I think we're in good hands, like the Allstate ad, with you.
[03:15:47.600 --> 03:15:49.401]  So thank you all for your support.
[03:15:49.401 --> 03:15:50.022]  Please stay with us.
[03:15:53.689 --> 03:15:54.889]  Hear that?
[03:15:54.889 --> 03:16:00.271]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransack the place.
[03:16:00.271 --> 03:16:03.173]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[03:16:03.173 --> 03:16:06.754]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[03:17:23.203 --> 03:17:24.444]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:24.444 --> 03:17:28.366]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:28.366 --> 03:17:29.907]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:29.907 --> 03:17:32.869]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:32.869 --> 03:17:38.412]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:38.412 --> 03:17:39.633]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:39.633 --> 03:17:42.554]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:42.554 --> 03:17:44.776]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:44.776 --> 03:17:49.218]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:49.218 --> 03:17:51.519]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:54.352 --> 03:17:58.293]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[03:17:58.293 --> 03:18:01.574]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[03:18:01.574 --> 03:18:07.836]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[03:18:07.836 --> 03:18:10.617]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[03:18:11.357 --> 03:18:15.182]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[03:18:15.182 --> 03:18:21.651]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[03:18:21.651 --> 03:18:26.618]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[03:18:27.355 --> 03:18:31.278]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[03:18:31.278 --> 03:18:38.482]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[03:18:38.482 --> 03:18:43.706]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[03:18:43.706 --> 03:18:49.389]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[03:18:49.389 --> 03:18:53.372]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[03:18:54.477 --> 03:18:56.817]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[03:18:56.817 --> 03:18:58.978]  We're really, really proud of it.

[03:19:37.502 --> 03:19:38.644]  Bought ease.
[03:19:38.644 --> 03:19:39.525]  Sold out in a month.
[03:19:40.777 --> 03:19:43.780]  Strongest concentrated turmeric formula we could come up with.
[03:19:43.780 --> 03:19:45.822]  It sold out for another month and a half.
[03:19:45.822 --> 03:19:49.126]  We sold it at 50% off till it sold out.
[03:19:49.126 --> 03:19:51.649]  And I think it's gonna be the same way with this fiber.

[03:20:14.535 --> 03:20:22.419]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:22.419 --> 03:20:24.820]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:20:24.820 --> 03:20:31.663]  This is Dr. Nick Begich and I'm standing in for the last hour of today's broadcast and what a week!
[03:20:32.353 --> 03:20:39.661]  You know, I mean, come on, really, the fake bombs, the whole movement on the midterms.
[03:20:39.661 --> 03:20:45.408]  This is probably the most important midterm in the last 50 years.
[03:20:45.408 --> 03:20:47.690]  If you think about what's happening right now,
[03:20:49.660 --> 03:20:58.384]  In terms of mainstream media and what's been happening and shutting down the voice of conservatives throughout the country.
[03:20:58.384 --> 03:21:05.667]  In fact, as really a globalist attack on the idea that nationalism matters.
[03:21:05.667 --> 03:21:08.008]  And I think it does.
[03:21:08.008 --> 03:21:09.589]  I'm glad to hear somebody
[03:21:12.212 --> 03:21:24.218]  For the first time in a very long time, with the suggestion that having your national interest as a priority is what the executive is supposed to be about.
[03:21:24.218 --> 03:21:25.559]  It's not about globalism.
[03:21:25.559 --> 03:21:34.643]  Sure, it's about sharing information, cooperating where you share values and common interests, but it's not the way it's been running.
[03:21:34.643 --> 03:21:37.405]  And certainly, America was never intended
[03:21:38.165 --> 03:21:40.326]  to be the policeman of the world.
[03:21:40.326 --> 03:21:46.727]  In fact, I would say way, way on the opposite side of the agenda.
[03:21:46.727 --> 03:21:54.970]  When you think about globalism, you know, here in my part of the United States, in Alaska, you know, this is a major issue.
[03:21:54.970 --> 03:21:56.370]  Think about where Alaska
[03:21:57.248 --> 03:21:58.429]  Sits today.
[03:21:58.429 --> 03:21:59.569]  We're at the top of the world.
[03:21:59.569 --> 03:22:05.312]  We cover the Northern Hemisphere so easily in terms of our strategic position.
[03:22:05.312 --> 03:22:14.937]  UPS FedEx base their international hubs here because it's about equal distance going across the globe into the entire Northern Hemisphere of the planet.
[03:22:14.937 --> 03:22:24.701]  When you look at strategic bases in Alaska, there's another reason Alaska is critically important to the defense of all of the Northern Hemisphere.
[03:22:24.701 --> 03:22:25.622]  When you think of Europe,
[03:22:26.454 --> 03:22:30.135]  We don't need to be based in Europe anymore.
[03:22:30.135 --> 03:22:40.938]  When you think about where America can reach the world, I mean in terms of our strategic bases, we have Guam on the far side of the Pacific, gives us access to Asia.
[03:22:40.938 --> 03:22:46.180]  We have Hawaii in the middle Pacific, gives us access to everything within the Pacific region.
[03:22:46.820 --> 03:22:57.870]  If you look on the screen right now are some of the major military bases in Alaska and these don't include a number of stations listing posts and other posts scattered around the state.
[03:22:57.870 --> 03:22:58.771]  When you think about
[03:22:59.927 --> 03:23:00.668]  I don't know.
[03:23:20.204 --> 03:23:23.147]  Aside from the police we have stationed around the world.
[03:23:23.147 --> 03:23:27.571]  A rethink of all of this is what's underway right now.
[03:23:27.571 --> 03:23:35.217]  And because of all this bomb discussion, there are also some major issues being missed that I want to cover in this segment.
[03:23:35.217 --> 03:23:40.542]  Have nothing to do with terrorism, have nothing to do with bombing, but has everything to do with things that actually affect us.
[03:23:41.222 --> 03:23:53.885]  Every single day, but I want to get back in Into the midterms as we look at what's what's shaping up as as the most important Election of our history and I would not trust these polls.
[03:23:53.885 --> 03:23:59.706]  I mean remember when Trump Was winning and the polls were saying he's 12 points behind.
[03:23:59.706 --> 03:24:02.747]  He's 10 points behind He was ahead
[03:24:03.675 --> 03:24:13.743]  The polls are not accurate anymore, and the reason they're not accurate is too many people are not participating, are not feeding the polling system, they just hang up.
[03:24:13.743 --> 03:24:16.865]  People are burned out at being called all the time.
[03:24:16.865 --> 03:24:21.909]  Early polling is predominantly Republican.
[03:24:21.909 --> 03:24:25.312]  I think this is a telltale sign of what's happening.
[03:24:25.312 --> 03:24:31.517]  The effort of the left is backfiring, the desperation of the left is showing itself, and the fact of the matter is
[03:24:32.277 --> 03:24:38.783]  We need to maintain the majorities that are in the Congress right now if we're going to see anything happen.
[03:24:38.783 --> 03:24:41.385]  We saw eight years of gridlock under Obama.
[03:24:41.385 --> 03:24:44.587]  Virtually nothing happened after the first couple of years.
[03:24:44.587 --> 03:24:46.949]  And then it was a fight for the next six.
[03:24:46.949 --> 03:24:51.293]  We've made it through the first two years of the Trump administration successfully.
[03:24:51.293 --> 03:24:53.935]  We've got the lowest unemployment in 50 years.
[03:24:53.935 --> 03:24:55.956]  We have the highest stock market.
[03:24:55.956 --> 03:24:59.840]  And I want to talk a little bit about the market as we go through the segments today.
[03:24:59.840 --> 03:25:01.321]  But the main thing to remember here
[03:25:02.208 --> 03:25:08.932]  Is interest rates are rising because of the Federal Reserve, which is not a federal agency, as all of these listeners know.
[03:25:08.932 --> 03:25:19.559]  But the fact is, the Fed is manipulating the economy and suggesting that there's going to be four to five more rate hikes over the next 15, 18 months.
[03:25:19.559 --> 03:25:21.380]  What's that going to do to the economy?
[03:25:21.380 --> 03:25:24.302]  It's going to stop it in its tracks.
[03:25:25.399 --> 03:25:29.803]  Think about what happens to the national debt as they increment up these interest rates.
[03:25:29.803 --> 03:25:48.501]  And a bigger and bigger portion of the debt that the Democrats ran up over the last eight years, doubling, maybe even tripling the national obligations going forward, to increase the interest on this now is going to just crush the drive that's happening right now to build this economy.
[03:25:49.053 --> 03:25:55.059]  We can't let the Federal Reserve continue to manipulate under the fear of inflation.
[03:25:55.059 --> 03:25:57.642]  There isn't really any inflation going on.
[03:25:57.642 --> 03:26:03.808]  It's so counter to logic and where inflation is happening is in wages a little bit.
[03:26:04.444 --> 03:26:07.045]  And long, long overdue.
[03:26:07.045 --> 03:26:14.747]  The average wages against inflation, even the small inflation we have, have been deteriorating over the last 15 years.
[03:26:14.747 --> 03:26:19.188]  It used to be one person in a household could support the entire household.
[03:26:19.188 --> 03:26:23.509]  Now, two people in the household are barely making it working full-time.
[03:26:24.671 --> 03:26:26.772]  The situation has changed.
[03:26:26.772 --> 03:26:32.856]  There's a lot of money have been made corporately in the last couple years because of the reforms of the Trump administration.
[03:26:32.856 --> 03:26:44.023]  And now we're starting to see those move down towards the workforce, towards working people, which actually the Republicans are representing better than the Democrats these days.
[03:26:44.023 --> 03:26:45.264]  I mean, think about it.
[03:26:45.264 --> 03:26:45.724]  At least
[03:26:46.954 --> 03:26:57.684]  We're looking at enhancing opportunities for people that are already in the country, and a chance to boost the workforce, not invite more low-wage earners in.
[03:26:57.684 --> 03:27:00.367]  We have a chance to build something.
[03:27:00.367 --> 03:27:06.553]  And the forgotten man is the average man and woman in the country right now.
[03:27:06.553 --> 03:27:11.237]  The market, because interest rates are rising, money is moving into bonds.
[03:27:11.237 --> 03:27:12.158]  This is the normal
[03:27:12.941 --> 03:27:27.278]  Progression, you know, when you can finally earn money and stable investments, people with retirements and needing that more reliable sort of fixed without the variable and fluctuations of markets, they go for bonds.
[03:27:27.278 --> 03:27:32.024]  But when bonds aren't yielding anything, one, one and a half percent, you just can't do it.
[03:27:32.711 --> 03:27:34.713]  So now you're seeing interest rates rise.
[03:27:34.713 --> 03:27:36.014]  People are moving into bonds.
[03:27:36.014 --> 03:27:38.296]  The market's going to take a dive because of that.
[03:27:38.296 --> 03:27:40.257]  That's a normal progression.
[03:27:40.257 --> 03:27:55.209]  And the Fed is driving that market collapse by making, of course, bonds more attractive to the investment community, and especially to the huge investment pools, the big retirement funds, the groups moving huge blocks of money across the map.
[03:27:55.849 --> 03:28:05.897]  And it's kind of interesting to see so much happening just a few days before the most important midterms in our recent history.
[03:28:05.897 --> 03:28:12.542]  Now, what can happen if the Republicans maintain their power in the House and in the Senate?
[03:28:12.542 --> 03:28:19.268]  What I think we'll see is the permanent fix on income taxes for middle-income earners.
[03:28:19.268 --> 03:28:24.612]  I believe Trump will follow through on that promise, as he has attempted to follow through on every one of his promises.
[03:28:25.232 --> 03:28:32.418]  In fact, of all the politicians in recent history, who's hit the meter more than Donald Trump?
[03:28:32.418 --> 03:28:42.106]  And yet, the amount of backlash from the left is crazy right now, and I think most people, most people who are independently minded are seeing the truth of it.
[03:28:42.106 --> 03:28:47.551]  This midterm, get involved, get people to the polls and make it happen.
[03:28:47.551 --> 03:28:48.952]  We're coming up on the break.

[03:33:14.355 --> 03:33:24.703]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:24.703 --> 03:33:26.905]  And welcome back to InfoWars.com.
[03:33:26.905 --> 03:33:36.732]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and I'm standing in on this last hour on this Friday, crawling up to the election just in about 11, 12 days.
[03:33:36.732 --> 03:33:40.215]  I mean, we're going to be there, and a lot is going to be decided.
[03:33:40.835 --> 03:33:46.718]  You know, with all the bomb dialogue, there was a really, really important story missed yesterday.
[03:33:46.718 --> 03:33:49.160]  And I don't want us to miss it on InfoWars.
[03:33:49.160 --> 03:33:53.182]  And it was President Trump talking about the pharmaceutical industry.
[03:33:53.182 --> 03:34:05.248]  And for those that were listening a couple of months ago, I was talking about sort of the fallacy in what's happening in medicine within the United States and what's really driving so much of the cost.
[03:34:05.248 --> 03:34:05.969]  And pharma
[03:34:06.933 --> 03:34:09.034]  Is the big debt.
[03:34:09.034 --> 03:34:12.616]  And there were a couple things that have been dealt with recently.
[03:34:12.616 --> 03:34:17.398]  The opioid crisis, obviously, has been addressed by the Trump administration.
[03:34:17.398 --> 03:34:19.538]  It's aggressively being addressed.
[03:34:19.538 --> 03:34:30.563]  But more importantly, he started talking yesterday about a reset on international drug prices in terms of what's going on there.
[03:34:30.563 --> 03:34:32.884]  And what he said was that's so important.
[03:34:33.442 --> 03:34:45.194]  And I talked about this a couple of months ago, was the idea that, first of all, Medicare and Medicaid, biggest consumers of prescription drugs, until recently, never even negotiated prices.
[03:34:45.194 --> 03:34:46.635]  They just took the prices.
[03:34:46.635 --> 03:34:48.877]  I mean, can you believe it?
[03:34:48.877 --> 03:34:56.305]  I mean, medicine, medical care in the United States, about 60% of the cost is pharma.
[03:34:57.040 --> 03:35:00.903]  Not surgeries, not MDs, not hospitals.
[03:35:00.903 --> 03:35:01.704]  Pharma.
[03:35:01.704 --> 03:35:02.985]  Pharmaceuticals.
[03:35:02.985 --> 03:35:06.087]  This is 60% of the medical cost.
[03:35:06.087 --> 03:35:10.230]  40% of that pharma cost is advertising.
[03:35:10.230 --> 03:35:21.539]  What you see in TV, what you hear on radio, talking about all these drugs that you can't even buy as a consumer without a prescription.
[03:35:21.539 --> 03:35:24.882]  So they're advertising to people that can't even make the decision.
[03:35:24.882 --> 03:35:25.062]  Now,
[03:35:26.073 --> 03:35:33.414]  If you say drug companies can't advertise because it's too big of an impact on drug prices, that's unconstitutional.
[03:35:33.414 --> 03:35:36.855]  You know, you recognize free speech, the ability to advertise.
[03:35:36.855 --> 03:35:50.278]  What is constitutional, and what can be done, is you can't limit speech, and I don't think you should any more than people are limiting Alex Jones, which I think is the biggest travesty to free speech in recent history as well.
[03:35:50.278 --> 03:35:51.438]  But what you can do
[03:35:52.091 --> 03:36:01.896]  With the pharmaceutical industry is you can eliminate the deductibility for tax purposes of advertising prescription drugs.
[03:36:01.896 --> 03:36:02.756]  Period.
[03:36:02.756 --> 03:36:04.457]  Just eliminate the line item.
[03:36:04.457 --> 03:36:09.419]  So now it has to come out of drug companies bottom line profits that they can't write off.
[03:36:09.419 --> 03:36:11.620]  And let's see how shareholders react to that.
[03:36:12.446 --> 03:36:18.189]  That'll reduce prescription drug costs more than any single effort the United States can do.
[03:36:18.189 --> 03:36:29.914]  Now, what Trump said is that the price Medicare and Medicaid should be paying is the international price of these drugs, which oftentimes is several times cheaper.
[03:36:30.544 --> 03:36:31.244]  Then in the U.S.
[03:36:31.244 --> 03:36:37.906]  This is why people kept running to Mexico and running to Canada to get prescription drugs they couldn't even afford in the United States.
[03:36:37.906 --> 03:36:40.706]  This is something I spoke about before.
[03:36:40.706 --> 03:36:50.929]  Limit the drug prices in the United States to the same as the lowest price offered of those American-made drugs anywhere else in the world.
[03:36:50.929 --> 03:36:52.869]  And they have to be offered at the same price here.
[03:36:54.231 --> 03:36:57.593]  You know, you can call it price fixing, you can call it whatever you want.
[03:36:57.593 --> 03:37:04.816]  What I call it is price gouging of our economy, 20% of our economy, is medical.
[03:37:04.816 --> 03:37:14.420]  A big chunk of that is pharmaceutical and this is the bleeding of America again to support a lower drug price for the rest of the world.
[03:37:14.420 --> 03:37:16.621]  We're subsidizing this too.
[03:37:16.621 --> 03:37:19.282]  I am so proud of the fact that finally
[03:37:20.567 --> 03:37:24.769]  Someone has stood up to the pharmaceutical industry in a way that's put them on notice.
[03:37:24.769 --> 03:37:27.530]  And you know what they announced yesterday then at the same time?
[03:37:27.530 --> 03:37:31.371]  They're gonna lower the price of one of the big statin drugs.
[03:37:31.371 --> 03:37:37.513]  Well, let me tell you what the latest statistics are on the pharmaceutical industry and pricing.
[03:37:37.513 --> 03:37:44.496]  96, for every 96 drugs that go up, one goes down.
[03:37:44.496 --> 03:37:45.636]  Now think about this.
[03:37:47.040 --> 03:37:51.742]  You know, they issue the press releases, they get the big story.
[03:37:51.742 --> 03:37:53.983]  Oh, they're being responsible.
[03:37:53.983 --> 03:37:55.103]  No, they're not.
[03:37:55.103 --> 03:38:06.048]  They're just spending some of their ill-gotten gain on more propaganda to feed us more of the stuff they want to call fertilizer that we know is not fertilizer.
[03:38:07.876 --> 03:38:12.706]  I mean, we can see BS when we examine it, and great graphics.
[03:38:12.706 --> 03:38:17.315]  You know, one thing I want to say, too, is working with InfoWars.com, the quality
[03:38:18.160 --> 03:38:18.520]  We're good to go.
[03:38:40.914 --> 03:38:53.259]  Perhaps a launch in the other direction against those that would inhibit free speech, those that would stand in front of this Democratic Republic's ability to debate issues?
[03:38:53.259 --> 03:38:56.520]  This has gone so far out of balance.
[03:38:57.190 --> 03:39:04.432]  That it is not representative of the republic that most of us recognize the country to be.
[03:39:04.432 --> 03:39:08.074]  The mainstream media has missed the boat.
[03:39:08.074 --> 03:39:12.615]  The national polling, I believe, is so far off the same way they were before.
[03:39:12.615 --> 03:39:18.657]  I don't believe you can poll accurately anymore because the way communications are diverse.
[03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:30.280]  So much as cell phones, very few hardline phones, the ability to get to actually registered voters that are frequent enough to count, we're not getting those kinds of results.
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:37.187]  I think the better results are going to come in the exit polls and the ultimate poll on election day.
[03:39:37.187 --> 03:39:38.909]  Vote now!
[03:39:38.909 --> 03:39:40.511]  If you believe in this republic,
[03:39:41.121 --> 03:39:42.702]  Vote now.
[03:39:42.702 --> 03:39:45.023]  Don't wait till the last minute.
[03:39:45.023 --> 03:39:48.425]  Don't wait till something might get in the way on election day.
[03:39:48.425 --> 03:39:56.450]  Take the step for your democracy, for your republic, and get involved in the midterms in this last 11th hour.
[03:39:56.450 --> 03:40:00.813]  You know, here in Alaska, we've got an election going on.
[03:40:00.813 --> 03:40:02.074]  My brother's in the middle of it.
[03:40:02.074 --> 03:40:03.935]  He's on the left.
[03:40:05.483 --> 03:40:07.984]  You know, and I disagree with Mark on a lot of issues.
[03:40:07.984 --> 03:40:11.626]  Other issues we're totally together on.
[03:40:11.626 --> 03:40:15.547]  Social issues, never on the same page.
[03:40:15.547 --> 03:40:18.508]  But on economics, often we are.
[03:40:18.508 --> 03:40:20.549]  And there's big issues in Alaska.
[03:40:20.549 --> 03:40:28.412]  One of the big issues Mark is being beat up for now is we have a proposition on our ballot that's going to change the way
[03:40:30.035 --> 03:40:30.775]  We're good to go.
[03:40:46.340 --> 03:40:48.761]  This is a voter issue.
[03:40:48.761 --> 03:41:01.325]  This is what all of us in Alaska get to vote on, and the one major issue I deviate from my brother in this election cycle is this one, and I say we need to maintain the status quo.
[03:41:01.325 --> 03:41:02.646]  Vote no on this initiative.
[03:41:02.646 --> 03:41:03.726]  It's too complex.
[03:41:03.726 --> 03:41:05.087]  It buggers up the whole system.
[03:41:05.087 --> 03:41:11.709]  It stands in the way of Alaska's development, which means it stands in the way of America's development.
[03:41:12.486 --> 03:41:18.851]  And one of the things I would say as we look again at the midterms, you think about what's going on.
[03:41:18.851 --> 03:41:21.592]  Donald Trump is taking on the pharma.
[03:41:21.592 --> 03:41:23.334]  That's the next big challenge.
[03:41:23.334 --> 03:41:24.735]  Medical costs in the country.
[03:41:24.735 --> 03:41:27.757]  I believe that's what his administration is going to turn towards.
[03:41:27.757 --> 03:41:36.403]  We saw that slight pivot yesterday being blocked out by the national media in the sense of being the most important issue of the day.
[03:41:36.403 --> 03:41:38.064]  20% of our economy
[03:41:40.123 --> 03:41:44.987]  is regulated and involved in medical professions.
[03:41:44.987 --> 03:41:52.892]  And when you look at the quality of care, we're rated in the 40th percent, 40th nationally, internationally.
[03:41:52.892 --> 03:41:56.114]  When you look across the world, we can't even do it right.
[03:41:56.114 --> 03:42:04.280]  When you look at opioids, you know, back in 2016, just before Trump came in,
[03:42:05.109 --> 03:42:13.056]  They created a situation where on opioids, the DEA was actually tracking, you know, from the factory to the pharmacy, right?
[03:42:13.056 --> 03:42:13.516]  Tracking.
[03:42:13.516 --> 03:42:20.662]  And then in West Virginia, they come up with millions and millions of doses for a town of a few hundred, right?
[03:42:20.662 --> 03:42:23.625]  I mean, so many, everybody would be dead there.
[03:42:23.625 --> 03:42:29.610]  And they made it illegal, the Congress, for the DEA to use that method to track
[03:42:30.322 --> 03:42:35.646]  Drug flows within the country, coming right from the industry, right in the middle of the industry.
[03:42:35.646 --> 03:42:37.187]  Now is time.
[03:42:37.187 --> 03:42:38.968]  Now is time to get energized.
[03:42:38.968 --> 03:42:40.589]  Get involved in these midterms.
[03:42:40.589 --> 03:42:42.431]  Pay attention to the issues.
[03:42:42.431 --> 03:42:44.512]  Don't look at the smoke and mirrors.
[03:42:44.512 --> 03:42:45.693]  Vote now, vote early.
[03:42:45.693 --> 03:42:49.676]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and you're listening to InfoWars.com.
[03:42:49.676 --> 03:42:53.238]  And we are breaking the back of the establishment.
[03:42:53.238 --> 03:42:57.101]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[03:42:58.467 --> 03:43:06.552]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt Justice Department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[03:43:06.552 --> 03:43:09.153]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[03:43:09.153 --> 03:43:12.615]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground.
[03:43:12.615 --> 03:43:15.217]  And I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[03:43:15.217 --> 03:43:16.778]  So we've already had incredible success.
[03:43:17.498 --> 03:43:29.913]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com,
[03:43:31.095 --> 03:43:34.799]  We won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags.
[03:43:34.799 --> 03:43:35.980]  We'll win.
[03:43:35.980 --> 03:43:38.884]  We have huge sales at InfoWars4.com right now.
[03:43:38.884 --> 03:43:46.052]  And we're still able to operate the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce and your right to the market.
[03:43:46.052 --> 03:43:49.736]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros the Globalist may win.
[03:43:49.736 --> 03:43:50.957]  This is InfoWars Darkest Hour.
[03:43:50.957 --> 03:43:51.978]  We need your support.
[03:43:51.978 --> 03:43:52.699]  I'm counting on you.
[03:43:53.039 --> 03:43:58.063]  Please tell your neighbors, your friends, your family, your community, constantly, this is the censored show.
[03:43:58.063 --> 03:43:59.224]  They want to shut it down.
[03:43:59.224 --> 03:44:00.845]  Don't let them do it.
[03:44:00.845 --> 03:44:02.947]  Infowars.com.
[03:44:02.947 --> 03:44:04.188]  We're in your hands.
[03:44:04.188 --> 03:44:18.078]  If you don't spread the word about Infowars, if you don't spread the word about Newswars.com, if you don't get the great Patriot t-shirts, all the beautiful designs, if you don't get the water filtration and air filtration that's the best out there, very low prices, if you don't get the great supplements, we won't be here.
[03:44:18.078 --> 03:44:18.799]  It's up to you.
[03:44:18.799 --> 03:44:21.281]  And you've been responding, you've been supporting, so I want to thank you.
[03:44:21.641 --> 03:44:24.684]  You're also getting really great products like X2, the last run of it.
[03:44:24.684 --> 03:44:27.406]  Secret 12, amazing vitamin B12, the highest quality.
[03:44:27.406 --> 03:44:29.408]  Brain Force Plus, now at 20% more.
[03:44:29.408 --> 03:44:34.052]  It's all 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com and free shipping.
[03:44:34.052 --> 03:44:42.000]  But it's got to end by this weekend because so many of the great products are running low, like Knockout, the great Sleep Aid, like Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[03:44:42.000 --> 03:44:43.381]  Nobody can get it at that price.
[03:44:43.381 --> 03:44:45.303]  But you are the folks that have stood with us
[03:44:45.563 --> 03:44:49.094]  So it's a 360 win-win at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[03:44:49.094 --> 03:44:49.716]  Please take action.

[03:45:58.709 --> 03:46:00.810]  And that's why they treat us like we're death.
[03:46:00.810 --> 03:46:06.933]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton, and to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild, I'm the Grim Reaper.
[03:46:06.933 --> 03:46:07.834]  Come to their door.
[03:46:07.834 --> 03:46:09.314]  I'm death, and they know it.
[03:46:09.314 --> 03:46:10.475]  I'm death of their system.
[03:46:10.595 --> 03:46:25.312]  Please don't forget that if you don't support this broadcast we'll be shut down and we make it easy with the very best products and we've had a 50% off sale, free shipping, the biggest sale in our history and it has got to end in the next few days because we're selling out a lot of our best-selling products and we

[03:46:39.322 --> 03:46:43.806]  You support the broadcast, and that lets us stand against the enemy, which infuriates them.
[03:46:43.806 --> 03:46:49.330]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters being huge InfoWare supporters?
[03:46:49.330 --> 03:46:50.431]  It scared them to death.
[03:46:50.431 --> 03:46:53.073]  It's why they want to extinguish us, but you won't let them!
[03:46:57.172 --> 03:46:59.779]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:18.599 --> 03:47:20.682]  And welcome back to Infowars.com.
[03:47:20.682 --> 03:47:25.387]  This is Dr. Nick Vegas sitting in in this last hour for Alex Jones.
[03:47:25.387 --> 03:47:31.214]  You know, Alex has taken so much nonsense over the last few months.
[03:47:32.935 --> 03:47:35.197]  You know, we need to encourage the guys here.
[03:47:35.197 --> 03:47:42.922]  You know, they're going out in public, taking the heat from people constantly for us.
[03:47:42.922 --> 03:47:48.887]  You know, people don't realize what a sacrifice it is to be in the public eye every day.
[03:47:49.828 --> 03:47:51.889]  You know, I've lived it since I was born.
[03:47:51.889 --> 03:47:54.731]  You know, my family has been in the public eye.
[03:47:54.731 --> 03:48:00.436]  And everybody, you know, wants to speculate on what you're about, where you're going, what you're doing.
[03:48:00.436 --> 03:48:05.680]  And, you know, Alex is subject to this now on a national level.
[03:48:05.680 --> 03:48:06.301]  But the voice
[03:48:07.001 --> 03:48:09.403]  Is not being silenced.
[03:48:09.403 --> 03:48:12.026]  And that's a credit to every listener out there.
[03:48:12.026 --> 03:48:17.150]  You know, I want to mention too, I always forget to plug my own website.
[03:48:17.150 --> 03:48:19.272]  I want to mention earthpulse.com.
[03:48:19.272 --> 03:48:22.735]  E-A-R-T-H-P-U-L-S-E dot com.
[03:48:22.735 --> 03:48:25.918]  I'm a volunteer standing in on this hour.
[03:48:25.918 --> 03:48:29.741]  How I make my living is through the things I do on my website also.
[03:48:29.741 --> 03:48:31.623]  So please take a look there.
[03:48:31.623 --> 03:48:32.744]  Earthpulse.com.
[03:48:32.744 --> 03:48:34.065]  I always appreciate it when you do.
[03:48:35.066 --> 03:48:44.956]  Under special events, a couple things I want to point out on the website is the most important segment I ever did with InfoWar.
[03:48:44.956 --> 03:48:49.781]  It's called Dr. Nick Begich, How to Break the Zombie Trance.
[03:48:49.781 --> 03:48:55.567]  And it's linked because fortunately a number of the listeners kept those segments and so they're still available.
[03:48:55.567 --> 03:48:56.748]  There's still links available.
[03:48:57.330 --> 03:49:01.754]  But I really believe that was the most important segment I ever did on InfoWars.
[03:49:01.754 --> 03:49:05.437]  And when Rob Dew and I did that in a park in Austin,
[03:49:07.250 --> 03:49:13.673]  We had a huge response, and it was a different way of seeing the politics.
[03:49:13.673 --> 03:49:18.935]  So I would encourage you at this 11th hour, take a look at that video again.
[03:49:18.935 --> 03:49:25.358]  I considered it, again, one of the most important things I've ever done in the 25 years that I've been doing broadcasting.
[03:49:25.358 --> 03:49:32.681]  And I have been a guest on over 4,000 radio broadcasts, either a guest or a host.
[03:49:32.681 --> 03:49:33.301]  When you look at
[03:49:33.881 --> 03:49:39.924]  The history of where we're at, take a look at TheInfoWarsStore.com.
[03:49:39.924 --> 03:49:43.626]  Our books and videos are all there, and this is kind of the two-for.
[03:49:43.626 --> 03:49:48.129]  You get to help Alex and the network, and you also support my work, and I appreciate it.
[03:49:48.129 --> 03:49:52.891]  They have our videos, they have our books, there's plenty of inventory in stock.
[03:49:52.891 --> 03:49:54.192]  Now is the time.
[03:49:54.192 --> 03:49:55.673]  Christmas is coming.
[03:49:55.673 --> 03:49:58.014]  Get good information to people.
[03:49:58.014 --> 03:49:59.435]  Between my books, there's over
[03:50:02.739 --> 03:50:04.400]  It's the same kind of approach.
[03:50:04.400 --> 03:50:09.745]  Cite the sources, get the data, report it to the public, and then let the public decide.
[03:50:09.745 --> 03:50:13.749]  That's what freedom of the press is supposed to be about.
[03:50:13.749 --> 03:50:16.171]  It's not what we see on CNN anymore.
[03:50:16.171 --> 03:50:23.677]  This opinionated nonsense that's based on nothing, air, rumor, you know, nonsense.
[03:50:25.254 --> 03:50:30.696]  It is an important time in art history, and it's an important time for all of us.
[03:50:30.696 --> 03:50:34.698]  Again, I want to jump back to a couple of really important things.
[03:50:34.698 --> 03:50:44.021]  When you think about the manipulation of media right now, the shutting down of Infowars just a couple months ago, in terms of the social media outreach,
[03:50:44.964 --> 03:50:45.865]  It backfired.
[03:50:45.865 --> 03:50:47.646]  It created the opposite reaction.
[03:50:47.646 --> 03:50:53.589]  I think more people are dialing in now and seeking out the information than ever before.
[03:50:53.589 --> 03:50:58.432]  When we think about the midterms, vote now.
[03:50:58.432 --> 03:50:59.433]  I want to say it again.
[03:50:59.433 --> 03:51:00.594]  Vote now.
[03:51:00.594 --> 03:51:01.835]  Get your vote registered.
[03:51:01.835 --> 03:51:03.536]  Don't miss that day.
[03:51:03.536 --> 03:51:07.158]  If you can spend that day driving other people to the polls, God bless you.
[03:51:07.777 --> 03:51:19.201]  Because we need to get the vote out and hold the majorities in the House and the Senate now at this critical juncture in American history.
[03:51:19.201 --> 03:51:22.021]  I've been thinking about, you know, how do I go forward?
[03:51:22.021 --> 03:51:28.723]  You know, I've got several segments set up for the last of the year.
[03:51:28.723 --> 03:51:33.745]  And one of the things I've contemplated is taking some of these basic ideas we've been covering in the last few months
[03:51:34.435 --> 03:51:39.637]  And reduce them to very simple written statements.
[03:51:39.637 --> 03:51:42.259]  And because they kind of take a life of their own, you know?
[03:51:42.259 --> 03:51:48.221]  Radio comes and people forget, but when you put it down in writing, it sort of takes on a life of its own.
[03:51:48.221 --> 03:51:51.523]  People copy that, duplicate it, take ideas from it and circulate them.
[03:51:52.023 --> 03:51:54.204]  So I'm going to start doing that.
[03:51:54.204 --> 03:52:03.470]  I'm going to develop a series of issues, develop the problem and the solutions as I see them, for some of the issues facing us internationally and nationally.
[03:52:03.470 --> 03:52:11.495]  And I'll give you a couple of examples of things I've been contemplating, and things I've talked about in this broadcast before.
[03:52:11.495 --> 03:52:15.698]  And let's talk about defense as a starting point, because this is the biggest area
[03:52:16.359 --> 03:52:22.387]  Of the national budget, this is the area that creates the most controversy when we think about international events.
[03:52:22.387 --> 03:52:28.216]  And when you look at military spending in the United States, this is the biggest.
[03:52:29.131 --> 03:52:30.212]  We're good to go.
[03:52:48.940 --> 03:52:58.423]  To maintain these bases at the level we're maintaining them now, in these foreign locations, where our servicemen and women are treated hostily.
[03:52:58.423 --> 03:53:00.124]  Take a look at Japan.
[03:53:00.124 --> 03:53:02.184]  They don't want us there anymore.
[03:53:02.184 --> 03:53:03.245]  Take a look at Germany.
[03:53:03.245 --> 03:53:09.827]  A man or a woman in uniform walk off of a military base in Germany, generally they're treated pretty badly.
[03:53:09.827 --> 03:53:16.909]  And yet, if we pulled those bases out, they wouldn't even have the resources to stand in their place.
[03:53:16.909 --> 03:53:17.089]  Now,
[03:53:17.859 --> 03:53:23.504]  Why do I believe we should start to stage a return to American soil of American servicemen and women?
[03:53:23.504 --> 03:53:30.910]  Because the money spent in these countries for their defense needs to start being paid by them.
[03:53:30.910 --> 03:53:32.571]  These are not third world economies.
[03:53:32.571 --> 03:53:33.952]  These are first world economies.
[03:53:33.952 --> 03:53:39.257]  They've had 70 years since World War II to get their act together and provide for their own defense and it's time.
[03:53:40.482 --> 03:53:43.224]  And I believe Donald Trump is absolutely correct.
[03:53:43.224 --> 03:53:50.708]  The number he used, 90% of NATO costs, is incorrect, and I think that's come out, but it's 67%.
[03:53:50.708 --> 03:54:00.294]  According to Foreign Affairs, the insiders, the Globalist Journal, 67% is the real number from their perspective.
[03:54:00.294 --> 03:54:04.257]  Why is the United States paying for two-thirds of Europe's defense?
[03:54:05.620 --> 03:54:07.440]  They can afford their own defense.
[03:54:07.440 --> 03:54:09.961]  And Donald Trump is absolutely correct on this.
[03:54:09.961 --> 03:54:11.961]  Something I've been saying for years.
[03:54:11.961 --> 03:54:26.204]  If you pulled all of those bases back, and all of those positions back, and put that spending in the continent of the United States and our territories, we would see the biggest economic boom in history.
[03:54:26.204 --> 03:54:28.725]  It would dwarf what we've seen the last two years.
[03:54:29.480 --> 03:54:39.344]  Because it's not only the direct expenditures of the military, it's the 3, 4, 5, 6, even 7 times that that money rolls through those local economies.
[03:54:39.344 --> 03:54:52.689]  That money could be rolling through our local economies, providing jobs within the support sector within the United States, and actually putting the defense back at home where it truly belongs.
[03:54:52.689 --> 03:54:58.011]  When you start to look at international interest that has been pushed by the globalists, look at the current economy.
[03:54:58.763 --> 03:55:06.867]  The current economy is generating a huge, huge amount of money in the corporate sector.
[03:55:06.867 --> 03:55:10.309]  And now it's being bled off by rising interest rates.
[03:55:10.309 --> 03:55:15.571]  And the national budget is being bled off by rising interest rates.
[03:55:15.571 --> 03:55:18.773]  So, again, as a simple solution, bring the basis home.
[03:55:19.853 --> 03:55:31.599]  Start a phase-out, a staged thing, give the Europeans and our allies a legitimate block of time to come up with their own solutions, but begin a staged return to the continent.
[03:55:31.599 --> 03:55:39.602]  A return to the United States of our men and women, and then deployed more strategically for what are truly the Republic's interests.
[03:55:39.602 --> 03:55:42.724]  Not the globalists' interests, not multinational interests,
[03:55:43.692 --> 03:55:46.613]  But the average American's interest.
[03:55:46.613 --> 03:55:49.674]  This is what the Trump administration is taking on.
[03:55:49.674 --> 03:55:51.175]  Through Big Pharma.
[03:55:51.175 --> 03:55:55.077]  Through a reassessment of sort of where our role is in the world.
[03:55:55.077 --> 03:55:59.158]  And by claiming to be a nationalist and many people screaming that that's wrong.
[03:55:59.158 --> 03:56:00.999]  Come on, this is America!
[03:56:00.999 --> 03:56:04.401]  Stand up for the nation that we all reside in.
[03:56:04.401 --> 03:56:06.842]  Whether you're on the right or on the left.
[03:56:06.842 --> 03:56:09.203]  This is our country.
[03:56:09.203 --> 03:56:12.624]  We built it through the controversies of both parties.
[03:56:13.308 --> 03:56:14.429]  Historically.
[03:56:14.429 --> 03:56:17.410]  We have built a nation that is an example for the world.
[03:56:17.410 --> 03:56:24.673]  Let's keep it an example, a good example, and not an example of continued interference in other people's domestic affairs.
[03:56:24.673 --> 03:56:26.234]  We've done too much of it.
[03:56:26.234 --> 03:56:28.195]  We've allowed it for too long.
[03:56:28.195 --> 03:56:39.220]  And then the backlash to our republic against Americans, who don't necessarily line up with the way our public policy is projected into the world.
[03:56:40.134 --> 03:56:42.256]  I think it is time for a reassessment.
[03:56:42.256 --> 03:56:44.198]  That's what America's in the middle of.
[03:56:44.198 --> 03:56:46.680]  That's what this election cycle is about.
[03:56:46.680 --> 03:56:51.745]  That's what InfoWars has been about.
[03:56:51.745 --> 03:56:59.031]  An informed public, a responsible electorate, so that we can go to the polls and vote and make a difference.
[03:56:59.031 --> 03:57:01.814]  Well, there's still an opportunity to make a difference.
[03:57:02.615 --> 03:57:06.861]  We have two more years of this existing Trump administration.
[03:57:06.861 --> 03:57:09.785]  Keep the Congress that he has to work with intact.
[03:57:09.785 --> 03:57:13.831]  And there is plenty of checks and balances within our system.
[03:57:14.787 --> 03:57:16.087]  But it is time.
[03:57:16.087 --> 03:57:17.928]  It's time to invigorate the public.
[03:57:17.928 --> 03:57:20.549]  It's time to support InfoWars.com.
[03:57:20.549 --> 03:57:23.569]  It's time to get involved in your political arena.
[03:57:23.569 --> 03:57:28.831]  Wherever you live in the country, step up to the plate, get people to the polls, and vote.
[03:57:28.831 --> 03:57:31.552]  This is America, and we're taking our country back.
[03:57:31.552 --> 03:57:36.253]  This is Dr. Nick Feggage with InfoWars.com, and we'll see you again next time.
[03:57:47.199 --> 03:57:52.924]  Years ago, Info Wars Life created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[03:57:52.924 --> 03:58:00.790]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[03:58:00.790 --> 03:58:03.953]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[03:58:04.133 --> 03:58:12.183]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms, there's no better product to help your body fight back.
[03:58:12.183 --> 03:58:21.194]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[03:58:21.254 --> 03:58:27.478]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, paldarco bark, and grapeseed extract.
[03:58:27.478 --> 03:58:33.182]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.
[03:58:33.182 --> 03:58:38.005]  Pick up a bottle of the new and improved Micro ZX Plus today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:58:38.005 --> 03:58:39.666]  That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:58:44.221 --> 03:58:48.462]  Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship.
[03:58:48.462 --> 03:58:51.943]  And you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say, affiliated with InfoWars.
[03:58:51.943 --> 03:58:53.703]  Yeah, some of them are like little side accounts.
[03:58:53.703 --> 03:58:56.984]  They know we had like InfoWars store that just showed our products.
[03:58:56.984 --> 03:59:03.746]  But they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us.
[03:59:03.746 --> 03:59:08.827]  Your excitement about America, your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brick.
[03:59:09.187 --> 03:59:15.289]  But the globalists now want to target where the resistance came from, so that we're not pesky in the future.
[03:59:15.289 --> 03:59:18.270]  I want to be troublesome and pesky.
[03:59:18.270 --> 03:59:19.370]  I want to keep going.
[03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:23.191]  I want to make them do the ultimate, not just destroy us financially.
[03:59:23.191 --> 03:59:25.212]  I want to push all the way.
[03:59:25.212 --> 03:59:26.492]  I've committed to do that.
[03:59:26.492 --> 03:59:27.573]  I've prayed for that.
[03:59:27.573 --> 03:59:29.233]  And I've been told that's going to happen.
[03:59:29.233 --> 03:59:31.654]  But you've got to back us, and I promise you this.
[03:59:32.154 --> 03:59:33.455]  I will never falter.
[03:59:33.455 --> 03:59:35.796]  I will never waver at the spiritual level.
[03:59:35.796 --> 03:59:36.757]  I physically will.
[03:59:36.757 --> 03:59:46.682]  But I give you my commitment, if you financially support us at 4Wars4.com, to give you my absolute total commitment.
[03:59:46.682 --> 03:59:49.284]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
