[00:00.000 --> 00:17.040]  Leading of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:17.040 --> 00:33.040]  They have forensics investigators that can take the smallest spec and turn it into real
[00:33.040 --> 00:38.200]  evidence and that's what they've been doing since they found that first attempted bomb
[00:38.200 --> 00:43.760]  at George Soros' house earlier this week and the other issue here is that it appears
[00:43.760 --> 00:46.920]  to me that this is not a sophisticated bomb maker.
[00:46.920 --> 00:52.840]  If you're going to send out a dozen or more pipe bomb suspected explosive devices and none
[00:52.840 --> 00:56.360]  of them not only don't detonate but they don't even smoke.
[00:56.360 --> 00:58.360]  Some of them apparently didn't even have trigger mechanisms.
[00:58.360 --> 01:03.280]  This is someone who was looking perhaps to scare or spread fear or send a message but
[01:03.280 --> 01:07.560]  it doesn't appear to be someone who actually was trying to blow anything up because he
[01:07.560 --> 01:09.480]  did a poor job if that was the case.
[01:09.480 --> 01:15.400]  Oh, he didn't do a poor job at all and I've been saying this over and over again, if the
[01:15.400 --> 01:20.560]  globalists and their minions get smart they will go out and they will pose as conservatives
[01:20.560 --> 01:27.560]  as nationalists and they will take one for the team and they will stage these events
[01:27.560 --> 01:28.560]  and blame us for it.
[01:28.560 --> 01:35.640]  You've got this van, we'll show TV viewers HD images of these that are posted to infowars.com
[01:35.640 --> 01:41.920]  with this van in Florida festooned over every square inch of the windows except for the
[01:41.920 --> 01:50.560]  front windshield with pro-Trump, pro-America, pro-Pence information and you know when they
[01:50.560 --> 01:56.840]  get into his laptop he's going to visit drudgerport.com, he's going to visit infowars.com, he's
[01:56.840 --> 02:01.600]  going to listen to Rush Limbaugh, he's going to watch Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson just
[02:01.600 --> 02:09.280]  wait 11 days out from this incredibly historic election and remember we saw them pre-programming
[02:09.280 --> 02:12.960]  everywhere that Republicans are going to get violent but Trump and Alex Jones are going
[02:12.960 --> 02:19.040]  to cause shootings and bombings of Democrats and then magically the kingpin leading the
[02:19.040 --> 02:26.000]  globalist invasion of America, the open borders, George Soros, hierarchically he gets the first
[02:26.000 --> 02:31.720]  fake bomb and I have the police commissioner NYPD saying the package bombs are not bombs,
[02:31.720 --> 02:37.560]  in fact the ones New York got don't even have powder in them.
[02:37.560 --> 02:45.920]  They are fake, they are fake, they are fake and this whole thing, there it is, pipe bomb
[02:45.920 --> 02:50.920]  and powdered liberty scene and we're harmless.
[02:50.920 --> 02:58.520]  It's all confirmed by the police commissioner but it's only in infowars.com and drudgerport.com
[02:58.520 --> 03:02.480]  and national review in a few places.
[03:02.480 --> 03:10.480]  So again it's the perfect patsy, I even said on Monday they'll bust them in a van with
[03:10.480 --> 03:18.720]  Trump stickers all over it, I said that, I said it, I mean we just, because it's central
[03:18.720 --> 03:25.720]  scripting, ladies and gentlemen, this is the most insane crap I've ever seen, ladies
[03:25.720 --> 03:35.920]  and gentlemen and now they've got it loaded on the back of a wrecker being driven to
[03:35.920 --> 03:39.800]  the FBI offices there in Florida.
[03:39.800 --> 03:43.680]  This is just incredible, this is in South Florida, he's in custody in connection with
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.720]  the mailing of pipe bombs, notice that Boing Boing and Bloomberg and all of them and seeing
[03:49.720 --> 03:55.120]  they keep calling it pipe bombs, no they're not pipe bombs.
[03:55.120 --> 04:01.840]  This bottle of honor roll fish and krill oil is not a bomb, in fact bringing one of the
[04:01.840 --> 04:08.160]  fake bombs we made with road flares and egg timers on them, those look more real and are
[04:08.160 --> 04:14.760]  more dangerous than these fake bombs because you could light one of these road flares and
[04:14.760 --> 04:20.240]  burn down a building with them, so technically it's not a bomb but it's an incendiary device.
[04:20.240 --> 04:29.360]  So the bombs we made in five minutes yesterday are more real than that fake bomb, so just
[04:29.360 --> 04:38.480]  think about how insane this is and how right on time, 14 days out Soros, 13 days out the
[04:38.480 --> 04:43.320]  Clintons, Obama, all these poor little victims that have been calling for violence and calling
[04:43.320 --> 04:47.280]  for killing members of Congress and calling for killing Trump, the Democrats at New York
[04:47.280 --> 04:51.400]  Times articles about killing Trump, Phil Mudd goes on seeing us as we're going to kill Trump
[04:51.400 --> 04:55.800]  and then magically they all keep saying Trump's going to get us killed and then magically this
[04:55.800 --> 05:00.700]  happens right on time, fake bombs get mailed out.
[05:00.700 --> 05:05.960]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now, Info
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.320]  Awards is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[05:10.320 --> 05:15.040]  justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate, people say why would you start
[05:15.040 --> 05:19.720]  a fight with them because they were already dominating and running America into the ground
[05:19.720 --> 05:24.680]  and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this, so we've already had incredible success
[05:24.680 --> 05:29.640]  but if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[05:29.640 --> 05:34.480]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you spread
[05:34.480 --> 05:40.160]  the word about our articles and videos, InfoWars.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[05:40.160 --> 05:43.160]  these brutal scum bags, we'll win.
[05:43.160 --> 05:47.800]  We have huge sales at InfoWars.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[05:47.800 --> 05:51.280]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[05:51.280 --> 05:55.360]  and you're right to the market, but if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[05:55.360 --> 05:56.860]  Soros and the globe will swing when.
[05:56.860 --> 06:26.800]  This is InfoWars Darker Sour, with your support, I'm counting on you.
[06:26.860 --> 06:36.640]  We have a video, the police commissioner of New York City says this was not a group of
[06:36.640 --> 06:38.100]  bombs that were mailed.
[06:38.100 --> 06:41.100]  Repeat, these were not bombs.
[06:41.100 --> 06:46.500]  These were inert powder inside plastic casings with shards of glass with wire sticking out
[06:46.500 --> 06:52.660]  of it to cause fear and it's been totally blamed on Trump, on InfoWars, on anyone criticizing
[06:52.660 --> 06:57.700]  Soros and all of his criminal activities that are legendary.
[06:57.700 --> 07:01.740]  President Trump is set to speak on this in just mere minutes.
[07:01.740 --> 07:07.980]  Again in South Florida, people called in the suspicious white van with hundreds of pro-Trump,
[07:07.980 --> 07:12.700]  pro-America stickers on it, reportedly is a Caucasian male.
[07:12.700 --> 07:18.860]  His name has not been released yet, ladies and gentlemen, but right on time, we have
[07:18.860 --> 07:21.700]  all the images of who's guilty.
[07:21.700 --> 07:27.540]  That's right, by extension, crosshairs on Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump stickers, Mike
[07:27.540 --> 07:30.260]  Pence stickers.
[07:30.260 --> 07:37.100]  It goes on and on from there and now he has been grabbed off the street and we're all
[07:37.100 --> 07:38.620]  seeing the white van.
[07:38.620 --> 07:45.500]  So we hear for months and months and months that Trump is going to cause violence and
[07:45.500 --> 07:50.740]  that Trump is an evil person that wants the media to be attacked when he points out that
[07:50.740 --> 07:52.300]  they're lying about him.
[07:52.300 --> 07:55.580]  When they call him a Nazi or they call him Hitler or they say he hates all Mexicans
[07:55.580 --> 07:59.900]  or all these incredible lies, if he dared defend himself, usually even a joking man
[07:59.900 --> 08:03.700]  or back calling, well, that's a fake news reporter.
[08:03.700 --> 08:05.460]  Mr. Acosta is a fake reporter.
[08:05.460 --> 08:07.700]  They go, oh my God, you want me to die.
[08:07.700 --> 08:09.100]  You want to kill us.
[08:09.100 --> 08:11.620]  We're like, that's disproportionate.
[08:11.620 --> 08:19.340]  If all we do is respond back to you and then it's the end of the world and then real Ryerson
[08:19.340 --> 08:23.540]  gets mailed out to the president and to the vice president and to Ted Cruz and a bunch
[08:23.540 --> 08:27.180]  of other people and then that's all swept under the rug and there's almost no news coverage
[08:27.180 --> 08:28.180]  of it.
[08:28.180 --> 08:33.060]  And then this gets huge wall-to-wall coverage, not the 50,000 legal aliens marching towards
[08:33.060 --> 08:39.860]  the U.S. or riding in on flatback trailers, not what's happening with China threatening
[08:39.860 --> 08:44.620]  war with the U.S., not getting into what's happening on the stock market, none of it.
[08:44.620 --> 08:50.660]  That's all, ladies and gentlemen, these fake bombs that, again, I have a stack of news
[08:50.660 --> 08:58.380]  here admitting pipe bombs and powder delivered to CNN were harmless.
[08:58.380 --> 09:06.580]  New York City police headquarters told the Associated Press on Monday, so I'm going to
[09:06.580 --> 09:11.780]  say it again, no bombs were mailed.
[09:11.780 --> 09:17.340]  Fixed bombs were mailed, but you look at the rest of the news, it's bombs, bombs, bomber,
[09:17.340 --> 09:22.820]  bomber in custody, bomber in South Florida, bomber in a white van, bomber had right-wing
[09:22.820 --> 09:25.780]  Trump stickers on his car.
[09:25.780 --> 09:28.100]  That's not a bomber.
[09:28.100 --> 09:32.580]  If you mail real bombs to people and any of them detonate, you're a bomber.
[09:32.580 --> 09:36.900]  If you mail fake bombs to people, you're a hoaxer.
[09:36.900 --> 09:39.460]  Got him.
[09:39.460 --> 09:44.860]  Fake obamers suspect in custody, Trump to go live, that's drudgereport.com headline.
[09:44.860 --> 09:51.300]  We have the live feeds posted at infowars.com and newswars.com as well.
[09:51.300 --> 09:58.100]  So who called this the entire time, the pre-programming that wait there's going to be violence right
[09:58.100 --> 10:02.580]  before the election and the media and the Democrats will be targeted and it is talk
[10:02.580 --> 10:08.620]  radio and Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Donald Trump and the Republican Party's fault.
[10:08.620 --> 10:13.580]  And the Republicans are calling for violence when we weren't calling for violence.
[10:13.580 --> 10:14.580]  It's the Democrats.
[10:14.580 --> 10:19.900]  So they were having a problem with all their violence and jobs not mobs, jobs not open
[10:19.900 --> 10:21.740]  borders and collapsing civilization.
[10:21.740 --> 10:22.740]  So what happens?
[10:22.740 --> 10:26.140]  Well, the game changer happens.
[10:26.140 --> 10:28.460]  The game changer happens.
[10:28.460 --> 10:30.500]  Magically the bombs get mailed out.
[10:30.500 --> 10:32.140]  They're fake bombs.
[10:32.140 --> 10:38.300]  The car, the truck, the van looks like something out of central casting, a white creeper van
[10:38.300 --> 10:45.540]  with every window except the windshield covered with dishonest media CNN sucks.
[10:45.540 --> 10:50.220]  I mean, this looks like this was produced at a Hollywood lot.
[10:50.220 --> 10:51.980]  These aren't old peeling stickers.
[10:51.980 --> 10:53.580]  These aren't stickers over other stickers.
[10:53.580 --> 10:58.060]  This isn't like any van we've ever seen, you know, where it's a real patriot with a
[10:58.060 --> 11:01.420]  bunch of stickers.
[11:01.420 --> 11:05.620]  Native Americans for Trump.
[11:05.620 --> 11:09.860]  My president is Donald Trump.
[11:09.860 --> 11:16.380]  I am Donald Trump and I approve of this message crosshairs on Michael Moore, crosshairs on
[11:16.380 --> 11:27.860]  Van Jones, crosshairs on all these people so they can be the victims, soccer recruits
[11:27.860 --> 11:28.860]  for Trump.
[11:28.860 --> 11:34.780]  So every group out there can now be demonized because they're associated with the fake bombs
[11:34.780 --> 11:41.740]  that the establishment corporate collaborator media is still saying are real.
[11:41.740 --> 11:43.100]  Let's put again on screen there.
[11:43.100 --> 11:49.300]  You can see if your TV viewer, like this is the OJ Simpson Chase or something, the wrecker
[11:49.300 --> 11:56.260]  with the creeper van loaded in the back and then soon we'll learn what was on his laptop.
[11:56.260 --> 11:58.900]  And well, the number one news site in the world's grudge report.
[11:58.900 --> 11:59.900]  Everybody visits it.
[11:59.900 --> 12:00.900]  It'll be there.
[12:00.900 --> 12:05.260]  Fox News, the biggest TV network in the world.
[12:05.260 --> 12:11.500]  It'll be on there and you know infowars.com and Alex Jones will be there.
[12:11.500 --> 12:17.380]  There aren't many computers in America that haven't visited infowars.com.
[12:17.380 --> 12:20.820]  There aren't many cell phones where people haven't visited infowars.com.
[12:20.820 --> 12:26.540]  And so guilt by extension, you see, just like the op-ed by Alexander Soros, the day after
[12:26.540 --> 12:31.740]  his daddy got mailed that little five inch fake firecracker.
[12:31.740 --> 12:36.060]  He said it's the rhetoric of the Republicans and Trump that's causing this.
[12:36.060 --> 12:41.460]  When he funds Antifa, we have the documents January of this year to cause violence and
[12:41.460 --> 12:46.540]  to try to create quote, a civil emergency.
[12:46.540 --> 12:49.820]  Alexander Soros now runs the whole situation for daddy.
[12:49.820 --> 12:50.820]  He's taken over.
[12:50.820 --> 12:55.940]  He runs the political action committees hundreds of millions of years old out in America alone
[12:55.940 --> 12:59.320]  and man, you see, you criticize him.
[12:59.320 --> 13:01.260]  You criticize anything he's ever done.
[13:01.260 --> 13:02.260]  It's your fault.
[13:02.260 --> 13:07.500]  And we're waiting for President Trump to come out any minute now and speak.
[13:07.500 --> 13:09.460]  But boy, Colbert was confident.
[13:09.460 --> 13:13.860]  He said, we've got who the bomber is.
[13:13.860 --> 13:15.900]  It's a make America great again.
[13:15.900 --> 13:21.740]  And they put that hat on Theodore Kaczynski, the unabomber who just so happened to work
[13:21.740 --> 13:26.140]  for the CIA for 30 years.
[13:26.140 --> 13:27.140]  That's L.A.
[13:27.140 --> 13:37.260]  Times Google search engine Theodore Kaczynski, unabomber, CIA, and of course it turned out
[13:37.260 --> 13:43.220]  that whole deal was staged as well by another leftist Theodore Kaczynski who was willing
[13:43.220 --> 13:47.180]  to take the blame for a larger project.
[13:47.180 --> 13:51.540]  And as the MO emerges, this person is either going to be a mentally ill Patsy.
[13:51.540 --> 13:58.900]  They've set up or he's going to be a hardcore leftist with university ties who recently
[13:58.900 --> 14:02.620]  become a conservative, kind of like all the white supremacist leaders that led Charlottesville.
[14:02.620 --> 14:05.060]  Their parents work for Obama, work for Hillary.
[14:05.060 --> 14:08.300]  All of them a year before work for Obama or Hillary.
[14:08.300 --> 14:16.020]  And basically it's just like a liberal theater club that go out and pose as Nazis.
[14:16.020 --> 14:17.020]  Total theater.
[14:17.020 --> 14:20.580]  Just like in the Alexander Soros documents where they wanted martial law in Maryland
[14:20.580 --> 14:25.860]  triggering race war, it talks about doing the event and acting and what they're allowed
[14:25.860 --> 14:28.860]  to burn and what the police have been told they're going to target.
[14:28.860 --> 14:33.940]  And then you've got the van out of central casting right on time with the person willing
[14:33.940 --> 14:39.140]  to go to prison to frame America and frame Trump for fake bombs.
[14:39.140 --> 14:44.500]  The whole thing, the timing, the whole nine yards, it's staged.
[14:44.500 --> 14:46.500]  Now that's my best approximation.
[14:46.500 --> 14:53.220]  And they wanted me censored and off the air before they staged all this.
[14:53.220 --> 14:54.220]  But they haven't.
[14:54.220 --> 14:58.660]  We're on hundreds of stations and we're huge at infowars.com, but you have to go to infowars.com
[14:58.660 --> 15:02.540]  and get the live feeds that break down the fact.
[15:02.540 --> 15:07.180]  Let's go to infowars.com, just the front page and they can grab the feed and email it and
[15:07.180 --> 15:10.180]  text it and send it out to everyone they know.
[15:10.180 --> 15:14.580]  So if you go to infowars.com front page, show me real quick please, crew.
[15:14.580 --> 15:18.900]  I will direct people to the proper headline for the live show.
[15:18.900 --> 15:30.660]  It says watch live, scroll down a bit please to the main feed area above that.
[15:30.660 --> 15:35.580]  And then through the scroller, click it a few times, right where it says migrant caravan.
[15:35.580 --> 15:36.580]  Thank you.
[15:36.580 --> 15:37.580]  Click it again, please.
[15:37.580 --> 15:38.580]  Click it again, please.
[15:38.580 --> 15:39.580]  Click it again, please.
[15:39.580 --> 15:44.820]  It looks like we didn't send out a live feed link, but it'll be there.
[15:44.820 --> 15:50.620]  We need to hit refresh, watch live and it'll be right there and you can send that link
[15:50.620 --> 15:51.620]  out to everyone.
[15:51.620 --> 15:54.580]  As soon as the president goes live, we'll go right to it.
[15:54.580 --> 15:59.980]  What else will the deep state pull with only 11 days out?
[15:59.980 --> 16:00.980]  Hear that?
[16:00.980 --> 16:06.460]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[16:06.460 --> 16:09.380]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[16:09.380 --> 16:12.940]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.

[16:29.660 --> 16:33.220]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook
[16:33.220 --> 16:34.420]  food and boil water.
[16:34.420 --> 16:39.100]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's

[17:55.500 --> 18:00.300]  In Liberty, David Hall, Diamond Gusset Jean Company.
[18:00.300 --> 18:05.620]  Infowars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing Pollen Block.
[18:05.620 --> 18:10.820]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[18:10.820 --> 18:17.660]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[18:17.660 --> 18:23.540]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[18:23.540 --> 18:26.860]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[18:26.860 --> 18:31.780]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[18:31.780 --> 18:36.820]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[18:36.820 --> 18:37.820]  symptoms.
[18:37.820 --> 18:41.620]  Pollen Block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[18:41.620 --> 18:46.380]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[18:46.380 --> 18:52.180]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[18:52.180 --> 18:54.900]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[18:54.900 --> 19:00.420]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[19:00.420 --> 19:04.780]  Pollen War's Life is launching its newest product, we're really, really proud of it.

[19:43.700 --> 19:49.580]  Bodies sold out in a month, strongest concentrated turmeric formula we can come up with.
[19:49.580 --> 19:51.620]  It's sold out for another month and a half.
[19:51.620 --> 19:55.020]  We sold it at 50% off till it's sold out.
[19:55.020 --> 19:57.500]  And I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber.

[20:03.060 --> 20:13.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.

[20:15.900 --> 20:24.660]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[20:24.660 --> 20:26.180]  Here we are.
[20:26.180 --> 20:30.500]  The 11 days out, ladies and gentlemen, from this historic election.
[20:30.500 --> 20:31.860]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[20:31.860 --> 20:33.780]  We have breaking news.
[20:33.780 --> 20:38.260]  Turns out the gentleman, the suspect in the white van festooned with the Trump stickers,
[20:38.260 --> 20:43.820]  had lived in New York City, recently gone to Florida.
[20:43.820 --> 20:48.140]  The vehicles covered in seminal Native American tribal stickers.
[20:48.140 --> 20:50.740]  The name of the company on the van is tied to Native Americans.
[20:50.740 --> 20:56.620]  They're saying he's a white male who was known to law enforcement for making threats.
[20:56.620 --> 20:59.740]  But again, nothing had been done.
[20:59.740 --> 21:05.780]  Just like we saw the threats being made supposedly there in Parkland, but nothing was done over
[21:05.780 --> 21:07.020]  and over again.
[21:07.020 --> 21:14.220]  And now right on time, 14 days out, now 11 days out, on Hillary Clinton's birthday today,
[21:14.220 --> 21:16.580]  we have this unfolding.
[21:16.580 --> 21:20.820]  So let's go ahead and go to this breaking news on Fox News.
[21:20.820 --> 21:27.420]  Just to recap, the suspect has been identified to Fox News as a white male in his 50s, former
[21:27.420 --> 21:30.500]  New Yorker now residing in Florida.
[21:30.500 --> 21:36.860]  And someone who has a prior history with law enforcement, who's known to them, has history
[21:36.860 --> 21:38.940]  of what are called terroristic threats.
[21:38.940 --> 21:44.020]  I want to just drill down on that for a moment so people understand what that really involves.
[21:44.020 --> 21:49.540]  The threats under the law means that you are threatening to commit an act of violence against
[21:49.540 --> 21:53.220]  an individual or physical property.
[21:53.220 --> 21:59.300]  And it also can include threats designed to influence a branch of government or politics.
[21:59.300 --> 22:03.180]  So I'm going to be paying close attention to that as we wait to hear from the President,
[22:03.180 --> 22:05.780]  the Justice Department, and the Homeland Security Secretary.
[22:05.780 --> 22:11.100]  I'll provide you with an update on the suspicious package investigations we're conducting here
[22:11.100 --> 22:12.580]  in New York City.
[22:12.580 --> 22:17.580]  And foremost, my message today is that New Yorkers are safe.
[22:17.580 --> 22:22.340]  There are no current, credible threats to any individuals, organizations, or locations
[22:22.340 --> 22:24.380]  here in New York City.
[22:24.380 --> 22:30.660]  New Yorkers are safe, but everyone, all 8.6 million residents and the millions of visitors
[22:30.660 --> 22:36.780]  who come here every year should always remain vigilant and aware of their surroundings.
[22:36.780 --> 22:42.780]  That is the New York Police Commissioner, pipe bomb, and powder delivered to seeing an in
[22:42.780 --> 22:43.780]  or harmless.
[22:43.780 --> 22:46.780]  All other bombs had no explosives in them.
[22:46.780 --> 22:49.900]  They were not bombs.
[22:49.900 --> 22:52.580]  You know, you've driven out in the desert and you've seen those tourist traps that'll
[22:52.580 --> 22:59.100]  have a fake Tyrannosaurus Rex, a fake Stegosaurus, a fake Triceratops.
[22:59.100 --> 23:02.060]  You get out when you're a kid and you run around them out there and then you go in some
[23:02.060 --> 23:05.620]  five and down place and maybe buy a soda and a candy bar with your parents before you get
[23:05.620 --> 23:08.540]  back on the road to Death Valley.
[23:08.540 --> 23:12.380]  Those aren't real dinosaurs.
[23:12.380 --> 23:16.100]  So if you run your car into one and die, a dinosaur didn't kill you.
[23:16.100 --> 23:17.820]  You ran into concrete and died.
[23:17.820 --> 23:26.260]  Well, if a bomb isn't a bomb and won't even smoke, it's not a bomb.
[23:26.260 --> 23:28.820]  Here's another example.
[23:28.820 --> 23:34.180]  You see those steak houses where they'll have a cow, a plastic cow, up on top of the building
[23:34.180 --> 23:35.620]  for attention.
[23:35.620 --> 23:37.380]  So you know there's beef there.
[23:37.380 --> 23:39.860]  That's not really a cow.
[23:39.860 --> 23:41.660]  That's not a real cow.
[23:41.660 --> 23:44.660]  Okay, we have the suspect here, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:44.660 --> 23:48.820]  They were calling him a white male, but he does look like he has some Native American
[23:48.820 --> 23:50.900]  or at least Hispanic in him.
[23:50.900 --> 24:03.020]  Suspect male bomber identified as Caesar Altair, I'm pronouncing that right, ALTIER.
[24:03.020 --> 24:04.660]  And this is out of the Daily Mail.
[24:04.660 --> 24:06.780]  Again, I'm not reporting that that's who this is.
[24:06.780 --> 24:10.780]  I'm reporting on the Daily Mail.
[24:10.780 --> 24:22.060]  Caesar Altair Sayock was taken into custody on Friday morning in Plantation, Florida in
[24:22.060 --> 24:23.980]  connection with the bombs.
[24:23.980 --> 24:31.740]  The suspect is a male bombing spree targeting critics of President Donald Trump.
[24:31.740 --> 24:34.740]  A male bombing spree.
[24:34.740 --> 24:39.220]  It was not a bomb.
[24:39.220 --> 24:41.260]  I'm going to say that again.
[24:41.260 --> 24:44.940]  We guys give me a wide shot here in the studio.
[24:44.940 --> 24:53.220]  That is a bronze recreation of a famous statue of the battle.
[24:53.220 --> 24:54.220]  What was it?
[24:54.220 --> 24:55.220]  Gallipoli, Thermopylae.
[24:55.220 --> 25:01.060]  I'm going from Memory Teleprompter 3 here, Thermopylae was also the battle of Marathon
[25:01.060 --> 25:04.980]  so many for the Battle of 300.
[25:04.980 --> 25:09.340]  That is not a real Spartan soldier right there.
[25:09.340 --> 25:12.300]  That is a recreation.
[25:12.300 --> 25:17.020]  I know you're saying, yes, Alex, we know that that is not a real Spartan soldier.
[25:17.020 --> 25:19.500]  We understand from 3,000 years ago.
[25:19.500 --> 25:21.900]  I know you know that.
[25:21.900 --> 25:25.780]  But I'm trying to explain to Democrats and CNN and everybody else that we don't buy
[25:25.780 --> 25:32.540]  your hoax that these fake bombs were real bombs and I don't buy any of the rest of
[25:32.540 --> 25:33.540]  your story.
[25:33.540 --> 25:39.820]  I mean, you've got this guy, they're calling a white male.
[25:39.820 --> 25:44.140]  And if you showed that picture to a thousand people, they would say he looks Hispanic or
[25:44.140 --> 25:46.140]  Native American, which is fine.
[25:46.140 --> 25:49.860]  I'm not trying to blame some group on race here.
[25:49.860 --> 25:52.180]  I'm saying none of this adds up.
[25:52.180 --> 25:53.860]  The van looks fake.
[25:53.860 --> 25:55.100]  The timing.
[25:55.100 --> 25:57.940]  The fact that the media hypes there's going to be all this violence against Democrats
[25:57.940 --> 25:58.940]  and it's coming.
[25:58.940 --> 25:59.940]  It's coming and it's Trump's fault.
[25:59.940 --> 26:00.940]  It's Alex Jones' fault.
[26:00.940 --> 26:03.300]  It's the Free Press' fault.
[26:03.300 --> 26:06.740]  Then fake bombs get mailed out.
[26:06.740 --> 26:11.540]  His van looks like something out of central casting.
[26:11.540 --> 26:14.100]  And now this happens.
[26:14.100 --> 26:20.460]  They're calling him a white male and I guess he could identify as white.
[26:20.460 --> 26:25.660]  And now we've got photos of him coming out at Blacks for Trump and other rallies.
[26:25.660 --> 26:29.380]  I don't think we know what's really going on here, but I'll tell you this, if you had
[26:29.380 --> 26:32.580]  all this pre-programming by the Democrats that the Republicans were going to kill them
[26:32.580 --> 26:37.620]  and there was no proof of it, and then magically it happens and the guy sends out fake bombs
[26:37.620 --> 26:43.900]  to the perfect list of globalists when it can only help them 14 days out from the election
[26:43.900 --> 26:44.900]  when this started.
[26:44.900 --> 26:46.500]  We're now 11 days out.
[26:46.500 --> 26:53.620]  This guy is the biggest idiot on the planet and is a total moron and can't find his ass
[26:53.620 --> 26:58.780]  with both hands to save his life or this whole thing's fake.
[26:58.780 --> 27:02.940]  And do you think somebody like this would have the perfect white van with all the stickers
[27:02.940 --> 27:08.380]  covering every window perfectly so that when this happened it would have the iconography
[27:08.380 --> 27:09.580]  of Trump?
[27:09.580 --> 27:14.980]  I mean this is as phony as anything I've ever seen in my life.
[27:14.980 --> 27:17.420]  It's more phony than a plastic banana.
[27:17.420 --> 27:20.140]  It's more phony than Obama's birth certificate.
[27:20.140 --> 27:25.980]  It is more phony than Hillary saying she has a clean bill of health.
[27:25.980 --> 27:27.940]  This is unbelievable.
[27:27.940 --> 27:31.620]  And we're here waiting for Trump to come out and we will cover it all show.
[27:31.620 --> 27:36.460]  Suspect was known to authorities and they let it happen again just like the Boston bombing
[27:36.460 --> 27:46.540]  they were known and had been allowed to go to Eastern Europe and to the stands and to
[27:46.540 --> 27:51.220]  areas connected to CIA operations and had been given fake passports that the Russians
[27:51.220 --> 27:56.060]  pointed out, the Tsarnev brothers and the same story over and over again the nightclub
[27:56.060 --> 28:01.420]  shooter in Florida at Pulse nightclub was part of a homeland security detail and his father
[28:01.420 --> 28:04.620]  then shows up bizarrely behind Hillary at one of her events.
[28:04.620 --> 28:09.460]  This is just crazy with perfect timing.
[28:09.460 --> 28:11.380]  All of this happens.
[28:11.380 --> 28:12.380]  What do you think's happening?
[28:12.380 --> 28:17.420]  We're going to come back, get to Trump, soon as he goes live and then we'll open the phones
[28:17.420 --> 28:20.060]  up and take your calls throughout the broadcast today.
[28:20.060 --> 28:24.300]  I took a lot of calls from military and law enforcement and EOD people yesterday.
[28:24.300 --> 28:27.180]  I got to almost all of you four or five were left at the end of the show.
[28:27.180 --> 28:31.940]  You can call back in that's great but law enforcement, military EOD and also detectives
[28:31.940 --> 28:36.140]  give me your angle on this and what you think's happening and why none of this adds up in
[28:36.140 --> 28:40.580]  my view unless it's a false flag stage Patsy event and I haven't said I bet they find
[28:40.580 --> 28:45.980]  some crazy with Trump stickers all over it and info or stickers thank God none of those
[28:45.980 --> 28:50.460]  and in the next few days I said that on Monday so what do you think's going on?
[28:50.460 --> 28:58.380]  I'll give that number out when we come back 877-789 Alex, 877-789-2539 we'll be right back

[30:00.620 --> 30:04.500]  Our grandparents and great grandparents know that they can food during the fall, so they
[30:04.500 --> 30:05.500]  have it during the winter.
[30:05.500 --> 30:09.620]  And that's what I'm talking about at m4store.com.

[31:04.620 --> 31:08.900]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.

[31:28.500 --> 31:33.500]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[31:33.500 --> 31:40.740]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[32:00.380 --> 32:04.180]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[32:04.180 --> 32:08.700]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the big island
[32:08.700 --> 32:14.140]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[32:14.140 --> 32:19.500]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[32:19.500 --> 32:21.060]  to unhealthy levels.
[32:21.060 --> 32:27.580]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH.
[32:27.580 --> 32:31.540]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[32:31.540 --> 32:33.020]  in the rainwater.
[32:33.020 --> 32:38.260]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter and not only were the heavy
[32:38.260 --> 32:44.340]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[32:44.340 --> 32:49.980]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[32:49.980 --> 32:55.300]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[32:55.300 --> 33:03.980]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[33:03.980 --> 33:18.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:18.100 --> 33:26.820]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[33:26.820 --> 33:33.300]  rallying Patriots worldwide.
[33:33.300 --> 34:01.700]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[34:01.700 --> 34:19.940]  Thank you very much.
[34:19.940 --> 34:25.780]  What a great honor to have you in the White House.
[34:25.780 --> 34:26.780]  Thank you very much.
[34:26.780 --> 34:37.340]  They call this, as you know, this is young black leadership, and it's the summit.
[34:37.340 --> 34:40.580]  And to have you here is truly my privilege.
[34:40.580 --> 34:41.580]  And we're going to have a lot of fun.
[34:41.580 --> 34:42.580]  We're going to talk.
[34:42.580 --> 34:43.580]  We're going to meet.
[34:43.580 --> 34:49.420]  But we've got to do it with a flash of light first.
[34:49.420 --> 34:55.580]  Before I do, I'd like to begin, and you are leaders, you're real leaders.
[34:55.580 --> 35:02.020]  I'd like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that
[35:02.020 --> 35:08.820]  have been mailed to high-profile figures throughout our country and a media organization.
[35:08.820 --> 35:17.140]  I am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him
[35:17.140 --> 35:23.380]  into custody.
[35:23.380 --> 35:25.780]  It's an incredible job by law enforcement.
[35:25.780 --> 35:31.220]  We've carried out a far-reaching federal, state, and local investigation to find the
[35:31.220 --> 35:35.580]  person or persons responsible for these events.
[35:35.580 --> 35:43.580]  These terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country.
[35:43.580 --> 35:49.900]  I've instructed authorities to spare no resource or expense in finding those responsible
[35:49.900 --> 35:57.420]  and bringing them to swift and certain justice.
[35:57.420 --> 36:09.420]  We will prosecute them, him, her, whoever it may be, to the fullest extent of the law.
[36:09.420 --> 36:15.660]  We must never allow political violence to take root in America, cannot let it happen.
[36:15.660 --> 36:33.100]  I've just concluded a briefing with the Department of Justice following the apprehension of the
[36:33.100 --> 36:34.340]  suspect.
[36:34.340 --> 36:40.540]  I want to applaud the FBI Secret Service, the Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney's
[36:40.540 --> 36:46.820]  Office for the Southern District of New York, the NYPD, and all law enforcement throughout
[36:46.820 --> 36:49.860]  the entire country, credible partners.
[36:49.860 --> 36:55.460]  These people have worked so hard, and to have done it so quickly, it's looking like you're
[36:55.460 --> 36:56.460]  looking...
[36:56.460 --> 37:01.340]  And we don't know what happened yet, but he was known in New York and made threats.
[37:01.340 --> 37:02.340]  Incredible job.
[37:02.340 --> 37:03.340]  So why was he allowed to do that?
[37:03.340 --> 37:05.340]  It's the same crap all the time.
[37:05.340 --> 37:09.060]  It's because people just accept this and they won't indict anybody, you know?
[37:09.060 --> 37:14.780]  The bottom line is that Americans must unify, and we must show the world that we are united
[37:14.780 --> 37:19.540]  together in peace and love and harmony as fellow American citizens.
[37:19.540 --> 37:27.020]  There is no country like our country, and every day we are showing the world just how truly
[37:27.020 --> 37:29.700]  great we are.
[37:29.700 --> 37:33.140]  So you are really very special people.
[37:33.140 --> 37:38.620]  I wanted to say that before our little talk, and I appreciate the time you've given me
[37:38.620 --> 37:43.460]  and, boy, one day, one of you is going to be standing.
[37:43.460 --> 37:47.460]  It could be three or four of you, actually, but you're going to be standing right here.
[37:47.460 --> 37:50.340]  You're going to be standing right here.
[37:50.340 --> 37:51.900]  I have no doubt.
[37:51.900 --> 38:01.940]  I have no doubt who in this room wants to be president someday.
[38:01.940 --> 38:04.540]  So it's an ambitious group.
[38:04.540 --> 38:06.020]  It's an ambitious group.
[38:06.020 --> 38:07.020]  That's great.
[38:07.020 --> 38:08.980]  Anyway, thank you all very much.
[38:08.980 --> 38:11.220]  I really appreciate it for the media.
[38:11.220 --> 38:12.220]  Thank you very much.
[38:12.220 --> 38:15.540]  I thought I'd do that, and we feel very strongly.
[38:15.540 --> 38:19.660]  Again, congratulations to all law enforcement.
[38:19.660 --> 38:21.860]  We have the best in the world, and they just showed it.
[38:21.860 --> 38:22.860]  Thank you very much.
[38:22.860 --> 38:27.860]  And let's be clear, a lot of times the police do try to stop people making threats that
[38:27.860 --> 38:30.100]  look like they're credible, but the grand juries want to indict them.
[38:30.100 --> 38:38.100]  They're subject at hand, and it is my great honor to be with so many brilliant, and that's
[38:38.100 --> 38:39.100]  what you are.
[38:39.100 --> 38:41.460]  Brilliant, courageous, patriotic, and proud of America.
[38:41.460 --> 38:43.780]  By the way, guys, I know we have a satellite feed of this.
[38:43.780 --> 38:44.780]  Let's go to our satellite feed.
[38:44.780 --> 38:46.620]  I just wanted to talk to the Fox feed.
[38:46.620 --> 38:48.820]  With an extraordinary confidence in...
[38:48.820 --> 38:51.140]  Because Trump's a few minutes actually ahead here.
[38:51.140 --> 38:53.380]  The great, great future of our country.
[38:53.380 --> 38:55.940]  Each of you is taking part in this.
[38:55.940 --> 38:56.940]  Thank you.
[38:56.940 --> 38:57.940]  Thank you.
[38:57.940 --> 38:58.940]  Thank you very much.
[38:58.940 --> 39:01.820]  I don't know if I want to do that, but I can see you're talking to Candice.
[39:01.820 --> 39:04.860]  Each of you represents the future of our nation.
[39:04.860 --> 39:06.100]  You know that.
[39:06.100 --> 39:11.020]  You are not afraid to stand up for your beliefs or stand against injustice.
[39:11.020 --> 39:16.860]  You refuse to be told by the same failed voices how to think or what to believe.
[39:16.860 --> 39:17.860]  You want to see them.
[39:17.860 --> 39:20.860]  I want to get the real meat out of it.
[39:20.860 --> 39:21.860]  This is live right now.
[39:21.860 --> 39:27.140]  We'll see what's happening with our country, how great it is, and how well, how well different
[39:27.140 --> 39:30.060]  groups of people are doing.
[39:30.060 --> 39:32.380]  I mean, nobody would believe this.
[39:32.380 --> 39:33.740]  The Democrats are very nervous.
[39:33.740 --> 39:34.740]  I will tell you.
[39:34.740 --> 39:35.740]  They're very...
[39:35.740 --> 39:38.020]  They're, you know, supposed to be automatic.
[39:38.020 --> 39:43.900]  They do nothing for you, and that was supposed to be automatic, not anymore.
[39:43.900 --> 39:44.900]  Not anymore, right?
[39:44.900 --> 39:51.140]  But you're not intimidated by the forces of political correctness because you embrace
[39:51.140 --> 39:57.260]  your own right to free thought and to free speech.
[39:57.260 --> 40:04.740]  History is fashioned by those like you who step up to the plate and get into the game
[40:04.740 --> 40:07.100]  and get the grand slam home run.
[40:07.100 --> 40:08.700]  I was going to say home run.
[40:08.700 --> 40:10.700]  Let's go for the grand slam home run.
[40:10.700 --> 40:11.700]  That's what you're doing.
[40:11.700 --> 40:12.700]  That's what you're doing, man.
[40:12.700 --> 40:13.700]  That's what you're doing.
[40:13.700 --> 40:23.180]  That's what you're doing.
[40:23.180 --> 40:26.180]  I can live with that.
[40:26.180 --> 40:28.540]  Let's stop right here.
[40:28.540 --> 40:33.140]  I wanted to actually carry part of the Young Black Leadership Conference today because
[40:33.140 --> 40:38.380]  I know a lot of people that are there, including one of our reporters, but it got overshadowed
[40:38.380 --> 40:39.940]  obviously by the whole pipe bomb.
[40:39.940 --> 40:40.940]  Sorry.
[40:40.940 --> 40:41.940]  See, I'm doing it myself.
[40:41.940 --> 40:42.940]  It's not a pipe bomb.
[40:42.940 --> 40:44.660]  The police commissioner says it's not a pipe bomb.
[40:44.660 --> 40:45.660]  It's fake.
[40:45.660 --> 40:46.660]  There is no powder.
[40:46.660 --> 40:47.660]  It's not real.
[40:47.660 --> 40:49.060]  The fake bomb hoax.
[40:49.060 --> 40:50.960]  The fake bomb hoax.
[40:50.960 --> 40:52.460]  The fake bomb hoax.
[40:52.460 --> 40:57.060]  And so when we come back, we're going to get into all that, but this is gigantic breaking
[40:57.060 --> 40:58.560]  news.
[40:58.560 --> 41:05.420]  Caesar Sayak, the alleged male bomber, had Trump stickers all over his vehicle.
[41:05.420 --> 41:12.620]  But on Twitter, he only follows 32 people, many of whom are left-wingers like Lena Dunham,
[41:12.620 --> 41:14.100]  Barack Obama, and Jimmy Kimmel.
[41:14.100 --> 41:15.100]  That's what I said.
[41:15.100 --> 41:22.980]  Another, this is what I feared, and I've said it on air, is if the left gets smart and they're
[41:22.980 --> 41:27.820]  willing to take one for their evil team, they will start going out and staging events in
[41:27.820 --> 41:28.820]  our name.
[41:28.820 --> 41:36.460]  But thanks to the internet and thanks to things being documented, we know their histories,
[41:36.460 --> 41:43.980]  like the four leaders of the alt-right white nationalist bumbos.
[41:43.980 --> 41:48.620]  And it's like, you didn't even wait five years since you were top leftist leaders working
[41:48.620 --> 41:50.300]  directly for Hillary and Mill.
[41:50.300 --> 41:54.260]  Some of you wait six months or a year, and then you pop up to try to lead this white
[41:54.260 --> 41:59.900]  supremacist army of BS.
[41:59.900 --> 42:03.620]  We see through you.
[42:03.620 --> 42:08.980]  And Charlottesville was the first big one when I started puckering a little bit.
[42:08.980 --> 42:14.700]  So you got a Native American, it's now confirmed, Seminole Nation, who was known to them and
[42:14.700 --> 42:17.740]  made threats reportedly in New York protected, and who's a Democrat?
[42:17.740 --> 42:19.660]  He's a registered Democrat.
[42:19.660 --> 42:21.740]  That's the breaking news when we come back.
[42:21.740 --> 42:25.060]  Oh my God.
[42:25.060 --> 42:26.060]  He is.
[42:26.060 --> 42:33.900]  He says who he is on his fricking LinkedIn.
[42:33.900 --> 42:36.460]  God, they wouldn't even get rid of that.
[42:36.460 --> 42:37.460]  Why, they don't need to.
[42:37.460 --> 42:38.460]  It doesn't matter.
[42:38.460 --> 42:42.460]  He could have pictures of him kissing Hillary Clinton, they'd say it was my fault or Trump's
[42:42.460 --> 42:43.460]  fault.
[42:43.460 --> 42:44.460]  Wow.
[42:44.460 --> 42:46.060]  This is getting crazy.
[42:46.060 --> 42:47.660]  This is like minute by minute is insane.
[42:47.660 --> 42:50.100]  We got a bunch of law enforcement and military callers.
[42:50.100 --> 42:53.500]  We'll talk to you next segment straight ahead, but this is crazy.

[44:38.260 --> 44:40.260]  I want to push all the way.
[44:40.260 --> 44:41.540]  I've committed to do that.
[44:41.540 --> 44:44.460]  I've prayed for that and I've been told that's going to happen.

[46:45.620 --> 46:49.740]  You support the broadcast and that lets us stand against the enemy, which infuriates
[46:49.740 --> 46:50.740]  them.
[46:50.740 --> 46:53.780]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos of 90% of the Trump supporters
[46:53.780 --> 46:55.620]  being huge Info Wars supporters?
[46:55.620 --> 47:07.100]  It scared them to death, that's why they want to extinguish us but you won't let them.
[47:07.100 --> 47:36.020]  Ladies and gentlemen, to be clear, I don't think we know who Caesar...
[47:36.020 --> 47:45.020]  It's confirmed that he's part of the Seminole Nation Native American and just like Michael
[47:45.020 --> 47:50.100]  Zimmerman was, I would not say Caucasian, they would whiten his face for the news.
[47:50.100 --> 47:55.620]  We now later learn through orders from the Justice Department to make him look more white
[47:55.620 --> 48:00.700]  but let's put on screen what the actual police mugshot of him looks like.
[48:00.700 --> 48:04.860]  But notice they're saying a white male, you know he's a member of the Seminole Nation,
[48:04.860 --> 48:05.860]  all this.
[48:05.860 --> 48:09.180]  I'm not blaming Native Americans, I'm not blaming anybody.
[48:09.180 --> 48:13.140]  It just shows how they manipulate everything.
[48:13.140 --> 48:16.580]  It's not real bombs, there was no explosive in it.
[48:16.580 --> 48:19.740]  That's the police commissioner of New York, that's all confirmed.
[48:19.740 --> 48:25.260]  So this was a bombing hoax, this was done right before the campaign.
[48:25.260 --> 48:29.380]  You've got his white van that doesn't have a bunch of stickers by themselves on it, it
[48:29.380 --> 48:35.140]  looks like somebody took a bunch of memes and put it together at a print shop or a graphic
[48:35.140 --> 48:40.700]  shop and then seamlessly do it, it looks like something directly out of Hollywood.
[48:40.700 --> 48:45.260]  It looks very, very scripted so you have the timing, you have the Democrats pre-programming
[48:45.260 --> 48:48.420]  that they're going to be attacked ahead of the elections and that it's Trump's fault
[48:48.420 --> 48:52.260]  because he's calling for violence against them when he's not.
[48:52.260 --> 48:58.460]  Now if you go to his Facebook that we're showing, they haven't taken that down yet and it is
[48:58.460 --> 49:03.860]  all a bunch of pro-Trump stuff, no Alex Jones stuff, that's interesting.
[49:03.860 --> 49:10.180]  Do a control F search, Alex Jones on that guys, do a text search, control F, Alex Jones,
[49:10.180 --> 49:11.180]  hope I'm not on there.
[49:11.180 --> 49:16.180]  But the point is, is it Caesar, and it's a spell a little bit different there than what
[49:16.180 --> 49:23.060]  the police have put out, it's Caesar, A-L-T-I-E-R, Shayok, on there there's an I at the end
[49:23.060 --> 49:27.460]  of it, of the Altier, Altier I or something.
[49:27.460 --> 49:31.340]  But the point is we don't know at this point, I'm reporting on what's mainstream news, I'm
[49:31.340 --> 49:37.860]  reporting on what is on, reportedly his Facebook, they have blocked his Twitter, we were able
[49:37.860 --> 49:42.300]  to grab parts of it and again we don't know how accurate this is because this is in the
[49:42.300 --> 49:44.620]  flow of information at the moment.
[49:44.620 --> 49:49.900]  But Caesar, Shayok, the alleged male bomber had Trump stickers all over his vehicle but
[49:49.900 --> 49:56.020]  on Twitter he only follows 32 people, many of whom are left wingers like Lena Dunham,
[49:56.020 --> 49:58.620]  Barack Obama and Jimmy Kimmel.
[49:58.620 --> 50:03.500]  And then now they're reporting he's a registered Democrat, and then again that links through
[50:03.500 --> 50:07.900]  right there to some of these public database sites that are similar to Wikipedia where
[50:07.900 --> 50:11.820]  you could edit that in real time, so we don't know if that's accurate either.
[50:11.820 --> 50:20.300]  Caesar, Shayok, 56 year old was born on 31762, currently lives in Florida, Aventura, I'm
[50:20.300 --> 50:24.300]  pronouncing that right, and previously lived in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Hollywood, Florida,
[50:24.300 --> 50:29.140]  Madison, New Jersey, sometimes Caesar goes by various nicknames including Caesar A, Shayok
[50:29.140 --> 50:33.540]  and Caesar A, Seyrol, other panel members and associates and it goes into that.
[50:33.540 --> 50:38.140]  We don't know if that is accurate, I'm not saying anything you can see on CNN or Fox
[50:38.140 --> 50:43.860]  News is accurate at this point, we're just reporting on what's being broken down.
[50:43.860 --> 50:52.820]  But look for when they're done with his face, he will be white as the side of a milk truck
[50:52.820 --> 51:00.620]  and he will probably have a Hitler mustache and Trump forever tattoos all over him.
[51:00.620 --> 51:05.060]  So I mean even this print from the news, it's been whitened compared to the digital mug
[51:05.060 --> 51:08.020]  shot that we can also put on screen for TV viewers.
[51:08.020 --> 51:12.220]  So look by the time they're done, the media will go with every angle to make the image
[51:12.220 --> 51:14.340]  of evil in this world a white person.
[51:14.340 --> 51:18.420]  I'm not the one saying brown people are bad, I'm saying the media is always trying to hype
[51:18.420 --> 51:23.100]  that it's white people that are evil and so they will just inherently because of what
[51:23.100 --> 51:26.220]  color we are, the opposite of what Martin Luther King talked about.
[51:26.220 --> 51:31.700]  So we should get Matt Bracken to pop back in on the show but I do want to open the phone
[51:31.700 --> 51:36.700]  system up guys so I can see who the callers are there, that would be stupendous so that
[51:36.700 --> 51:41.100]  I can start going to some of the military and law enforcement callers that have called
[51:41.100 --> 51:43.980]  in to the broadcast today and we will take your calls.
[51:43.980 --> 51:52.540]  But again, if you just tuned in, the massive pre-programming that we saw in the last year
[51:52.540 --> 51:55.900]  saying Trump's going to cause violence, Alex Jones is going to cause violence, Trump's
[51:55.900 --> 52:00.300]  calling for killing the media, Trump says, hey CNN's lying about me hating Mexicans,
[52:00.300 --> 52:02.260]  you want to kill the media?
[52:02.260 --> 52:03.260]  Well no I don't.
[52:03.260 --> 52:08.780]  Well don't question us, it causes violence so Alex Jones wants to use battle rifles,
[52:08.780 --> 52:12.540]  he told his listeners to kill us, it's not true, there is no video.
[52:12.540 --> 52:16.380]  Well they wouldn't be doing that if they weren't planning to attack themselves.
[52:16.380 --> 52:21.540]  And now someone with a dubious background, we're told as a white guy, we're told he
[52:21.540 --> 52:25.100]  sent real bombs, the police say they're not real bombs, they're fake bombs, the media
[52:25.100 --> 52:29.420]  still goes with the fact that they're real bombs, he'd reportedly been in trouble before
[52:29.420 --> 52:35.460]  for making threats but there was no indictments, he was known to law enforcement and so here
[52:35.460 --> 52:40.740]  we go, I said there would be something like this, bombings or shootings or attempted ones
[52:40.740 --> 52:45.180]  of democrats ahead of the election, I guess two weeks out it would start.
[52:45.180 --> 52:50.380]  This is the October surprise, historically in late October this is when incumbents start
[52:50.380 --> 52:56.620]  wars to stay in, Trump hasn't done that, and those that aren't in power stage violent
[52:56.620 --> 53:01.780]  events against themselves, half the episodes on House of Cards were that because everyone
[53:01.780 --> 53:08.100]  knows that goes on, then I sit here and point out that all these democrats have written
[53:08.100 --> 53:11.220]  on a biographies admitting that they would throw bricks through their own windows to
[53:11.220 --> 53:16.500]  get elected to the city council, you throw bricks through your window to get elected
[53:16.500 --> 53:22.660]  to city council and blame your enemy, you bomb yourself to get into congress, you stage
[53:22.660 --> 53:27.860]  mass shootings to get into the presidency of your democrat, but we caught them using
[53:27.860 --> 53:33.780]  their Islamist scripts to blame Trump last year in Vegas, so that story went away didn't
[53:33.780 --> 53:40.020]  it, the multiple shooters, the witnesses, I was told by the FBI hostage rescue team
[53:40.020 --> 53:46.980]  that they went into the room, that his body was already cold, that there was Islamic paraphernalia
[53:46.980 --> 53:51.100]  and Antifa paraphernalia, they thought he was a gun dealer and a gun deal gone bad, all
[53:51.100 --> 53:58.860]  of that came out, then I was shown footage out of Florida and I had to sign an NDAA to
[53:58.860 --> 54:06.740]  even see it and I can't tell you what was on it, but let me tell you, he was a leftist,
[54:06.740 --> 54:12.380]  he was a gun runner, he was a spook and he went in there when the Saudi Arabians were
[54:12.380 --> 54:16.740]  in town, he thought for a gun deal and they used him because they couldn't fly weapons
[54:16.740 --> 54:22.700]  in for the Saudi Arabian military convention, 10,000 members of the Saudi military were
[54:22.700 --> 54:29.460]  there and they had that guy that had sold them weapons before come to the event, he
[54:29.460 --> 54:35.580]  sold weapons right there in Nevada and in Florida, that's where Southcom and Centcom
[54:35.580 --> 54:42.020]  and all that stuff has different headquarters basis and we don't know exactly what happened
[54:42.020 --> 54:46.020]  but we know the official story is not true and you notice here later, you don't hear
[54:46.020 --> 54:50.420]  Jack about this, we're going to start the next hour and go right to Kyle and Steve
[54:50.420 --> 54:54.860]  and Ken and Steven and Phil and Shane and Derek and Joe and if any of you guys were
[54:54.860 --> 54:59.340]  on hold yesterday, let me know so I'll go to you first because I ended the show with
[54:59.340 --> 55:03.220]  about five of you guys on hold and I apologize but that was just the end of the show.
[55:03.220 --> 55:08.660]  So here's where we are, it's admitted these weren't real bombs but the media keeps going
[55:08.660 --> 55:12.540]  and saying they are, that's huge, this guy looks like he's out of central casting with
[55:12.540 --> 55:17.060]  this white van with professional plastering all over it like somebody overdid it from
[55:17.060 --> 55:20.580]  Hollywood because there's not time to have old stickers and things covered up and you
[55:20.580 --> 55:25.060]  know, no, no, no, this is all been done to stick out like a sore thumb and to be a perfect
[55:25.060 --> 55:30.380]  billboard on the news in the media and the timing is perfect and the pre-programming
[55:30.380 --> 55:36.700]  is perfect and so this stinks to high heaven to me, we will break it all down in the next
[55:36.700 --> 55:41.300]  hour with your phone calls and more and we'll look at what this is distracting us from,
[55:41.300 --> 55:46.540]  the open borders, the caravan, Trump's executive orders, the attempts to plunge the stock market
[55:46.540 --> 55:53.100]  and everything else, in fact where is the Dow Jones right now and finally for this hour
[55:53.100 --> 55:57.980]  they wanted to silence us and try to restrict us on social media and other systems ahead
[55:57.980 --> 56:05.420]  of the last few weeks so that we couldn't be on air when all of this incredible information
[56:05.420 --> 56:11.900]  broke loose so that we couldn't respond in live time and do what we've done in other
[56:11.900 --> 56:16.700]  events and basically sabotage their PSYOP that they run off these false flags and this
[56:16.700 --> 56:22.300]  is a false flag completely, I mean there's no doubt that this is staged, it's like when
[56:22.300 --> 56:27.300]  you see an infomercial or you see bad actors, you go that isn't real, that's actors, you
[56:27.300 --> 56:33.580]  just look at this, it's fake, now do we know the whole story, no but it's fake, it's like
[56:33.580 --> 56:38.060]  biting into a plastic banana, it's not a real banana or a plastic orange or a plastic strawberry,
[56:38.060 --> 56:42.860]  do you know the type of plastic it is, do you know who made it, no but it's not real,
[56:42.860 --> 56:49.060]  it's like I see all of the news are opening sex brothels with robot dolls, you're like
[56:49.060 --> 56:53.420]  how do you know it's a robot, well it looks like one and they say it is, well who made
[56:53.420 --> 56:59.140]  it then if it's not a real woman, you see, it's these games they play, that said we've
[56:59.140 --> 57:03.380]  got great products and your support of us makes it all possible and Imple Wars is a

[59:41.660 --> 59:48.980]  that have stood with us so it's a 360 win win at InfoWars.com or AAA-253-3139, please
[59:48.980 --> 01:00:18.180]  stick at them.
[01:00:18.180 --> 01:00:24.740]  Now I want to go to part of Paul Watson's report, pipe bomb rollout doesn't pass the
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:30.340]  smell test, there's another report by John Bowne and I'm going to come back in the next
[01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:34.420]  segment and go to your phone calls, Law Enforcement Military to give us your expert take on what
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:38.980]  you're witnessing but the President says it's unfortunate that bomb stuff slowing Republican
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:43.820]  momentum going into midterms, I mean you have a real riots in being mailed to Republicans,
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:47.300]  the media doesn't even cover it, you've got real Congressmen being shot, you've got real
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:51.540]  people having their ribs broken, you've got real ICE being killed, you've got real caravans
[01:00:51.540 --> 01:00:57.900]  invading and then meanwhile all these globalists get mailed fake bombs, that's the scandal
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.020]  and now they kept some guy who has a mixed Democrat-Republican background that they say
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:07.300]  is a white guy and he's not and he's got like some central casting van with these perfect
[01:01:07.300 --> 01:01:14.300]  raps all over it of pro-Trump stuff, it's just incredible and I see this as a beta test
[01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:19.620]  14 days out, now 11 days out, to see how America would buy into this and so I think
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.740]  if we buy this and we don't expose it to false flag, I think they got the big truck bombs
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.940]  loaded, the mass shooters ready, so get ready for phase two everybody, here's part of Paul
[01:01:28.940 --> 01:01:30.500]  Watson's report.
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:35.620]  All political violence is horrendous and unlike some on the left who have either ignored or
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:42.580]  advocated far left and Tifa violence, I denounce all political violence and yes far right extremism
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:47.260]  and far right violence exists and it's a problem and yes it could very well turn out to be
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:52.460]  that the male bomber is in fact a MAGA bomber, a Trump supporter trying to exact political
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:57.300]  revenge against Trump's perceived enemies but to simply ask questions about a major
[01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:01.820]  news event that could have a massive impact on elections that are less than three weeks
[01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:07.780]  away isn't to engage in conspiracy theories until investigators nail down for certain
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:14.340]  the identity and the motive of the bomber, everything is a theory so here are a few questions.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:18.540]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism that could only have
[01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:21.380]  the effect of making Trump look bad?
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:25.500]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism that would distract
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:30.180]  from the migrant caravan, a winning political issue for Trump?
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:34.260]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism right off the back of
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:39.260]  Trump securing a major political victory in securing the nomination of Kavanaugh?
[01:02:39.260 --> 01:02:43.620]  Why would a Trump supporter engage in a campaign of domestic terrorism when polls showed that
[01:02:43.620 --> 01:02:48.540]  the race for Congress was starting to narrow in favour of Republicans?
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:53.660]  The package sent to former Vice President Joe Biden in Delaware wasn't delivered because
[01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:59.220]  of postage due, who will go to the trouble and risk of building a mail bomb and then
[01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:04.660]  forget to add the right postage and why did the bomber attach postage to a package that
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:06.420]  was delivered by a courier?
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:11.340]  Why would the mail bomber put what looked like timers on the bombs when he had no idea
[01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:12.860]  when they'd be delivered?
[01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:16.700]  Whoever this guy is I think it's safe to say he's not the brightest and will probably
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:18.180]  be caught very quickly.
[01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:23.020]  Why were the bombs apparently hoaxed devices that were never intended to explode?
[01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.420]  If the culprit intended to cause harm why was the powder found inside the package sent
[01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.900]  to CNN deemed harmless?
[01:03:29.900 --> 01:03:35.300]  Does this suggest that the motive was merely to send a political message and not to harm
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.300]  anyone?
[01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.220]  Why were the bombs fitted with a cheap digital display clock that doesn't even have an alarm
[01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:44.100]  which would be a necessity to trigger a bomb?
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:49.420]  Why is there a joke version of the ISIS flag attached to the device sent to CNN?
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:52.580]  Why did the bombs have wires attached to both ends?
[01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:57.740]  According to this former bomb disposal officer, proper pipe bombs don't have wires connected
[01:03:57.740 --> 01:03:59.820]  to both ends, that's dumb.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:05.460]  Why were the timers so big when that's completely unnecessary and why weren't they placed inside
[01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:06.460]  the pipe bomb?
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.780]  Why were these bombs made to look so hokey that even law enforcement officials are now
[01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.580]  describing them as Hollywood style hoaxes?
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:18.460]  Why was Debbie Wasserman Schultz named on one of the packages as the return address?
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:24.060]  Does this suggest the bomber may in fact be a progressive, angered at the DNC's treatment
[01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.260]  of Bernie Sanders?
[01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:29.860]  If the media really cares about condemning political violence, why have they spent the
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:35.940]  past two years either ignoring or tacitly endorsing antifa-led political violence?
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:41.180]  If the media cares about condemning political violence, why did they all but ignore the
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:45.820]  bomb threats against Trump and the riots sent to Don Jr. and the Pentagon?
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:51.380]  If the New York Times really cares about toning down the rhetoric, why did they just publish
[01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:55.340]  a short story depicting the assassination of President Trump?
[01:04:55.340 --> 01:05:25.300]  We'll be back with your phone calls in T-minus 60.
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:42.300]  Thank you.
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:57.940]  give you my absolute total commitment.
[01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:08.300]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:13.620]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:16.180]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:18.820]  Trump mulls executive order to block all migrants
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:21.340]  at the border and just stop letting them come in
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.420]  and claim amnesty or claim that they are refugees
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.020]  from political or religious oppression
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:30.260]  if they don't do it the official proper way.
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.340]  And that's the way to just end the flood
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:35.020]  and the fact that the border has already been collapsed
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:38.460]  with the giant illegal alien invasion openly run
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:42.940]  by the UN marching towards the United States.
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:47.540]  Other news at infowars.com is so incredibly critical
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:52.060]  right now they have a man arrested for bomb package campaign
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:56.020]  but it's a fake bomb the New York police and FBI say
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.340]  they say there's no real powder in it.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.820]  Former secret service agent says identity of male bomber
[01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:02.560]  is going to surprise people.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:06.020]  Well, now we know it's a supposed Trump supporter
[01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.700]  but all we know is that they are Trump stickers
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:13.100]  all over the vehicle right out of central casting.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.140]  And even CNN analysts have had to admit
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.620]  that the false flag theory is one that holds water
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.540]  and has to be looked at.
[01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:24.500]  There's also new video of Hillary next to Donna Shalala
[01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:27.860]  to ringwraith which is looking like she's about to die
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:31.620]  having another coughing fit on her birthday.
[01:07:31.620 --> 01:07:33.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, so coming up,
[01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:37.640]  CNN analysts admits false flag male bomb theory is possible.
[01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.140]  Here's the deal that I'm going to your calls right now.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:44.740]  You have all the pre-programming
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:50.800]  that's gone on saying that Trump and Republicans
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.820]  are going to cause violence against the media
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.860]  and then they lie and say that Trump is calling for violence
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:57.100]  on the media when he's not.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:59.100]  And they say I'm calling for violence when we're not.
[01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:00.920]  They're saying it's imminent, it's coming.
[01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.660]  And then it starts when they're the ones really pushing
[01:08:03.660 --> 01:08:06.620]  violence hoping we get violent back trying to pick a fight.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:10.300]  And then magically some guy who's got the year and a half
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:11.740]  of MO being a Trump supporter,
[01:08:11.740 --> 01:08:13.540]  but his Twitter is Democrat supporting.
[01:08:13.540 --> 01:08:15.780]  He's got different aliases and different names,
[01:08:15.780 --> 01:08:18.380]  but it's him on the Twitter and him on the Facebook.
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.420]  It's like there's two different identities.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.060]  When you see stuff like that,
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:25.360]  it is very, very, very suspicious.
[01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:30.360]  One name is Caesar Altaari Rondazo.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:35.360]  And then he has this other name that's different
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:42.040]  that they're saying is his official name.
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.400]  So what do you think about that?
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.400]  He is Caesar Altaari Rondazo.
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:52.280]  And it's him on Facebook and all these videos
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:53.280]  that Trump rallies.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.440]  And then his official name released by the police
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:00.380]  is Caesar Altair Sayak.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.080]  So it gets weirder and weirder.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:10.080]  Meanwhile, Pipe Bomb and Powder Liberty CNN were harmless,
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:14.680]  but you're not seeing that in a lot of news.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.920]  Trump unfortunate that bomb stuff slowing Republican momentum
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.840]  going into midterms.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:20.360]  Yeah, unfortunate.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.000]  In a 3 a.m. tweet, Trump claims he's being blamed
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:23.840]  for mail bombs.
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:27.240]  Boston Globe basically attacks Trump like he's crazy.
[01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:28.600]  They're all over the news.
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:29.880]  Chang, it's Trump's fault.
[01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.080]  George Soros' son wrote an op-ed.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.360]  I mean, that's what I love.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.120]  Trump can say the sky's blue and they say he's lying.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:39.480]  Okay, I'm taking your calls now
[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.280]  because law enforcement and military people
[01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.320]  that have worked in EOD but now it's expanded
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:49.320]  as to larger detective skillset really give us
[01:09:49.360 --> 01:09:52.800]  a lot of interesting perspective
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:54.440]  into what's really going on here.
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.000]  So we're gonna go to Kyle.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.280]  We're gonna go to Ab, we're gonna go to Kevin,
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.400]  we're gonna go to Steve, we're gonna go to Ken,
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:01.560]  we're gonna go to Vox, we're gonna go to Phil,
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.480]  Shane, Joe, and others.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.240]  Who should we go to first?
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.480]  We haven't talked to anybody from the Israeli Defense Force,
[01:10:09.480 --> 01:10:11.040]  border security explosives yet.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.960]  So let's talk to Phil in Illinois.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:15.160]  Thanks for calling, you're on the air.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.400]  Hey, Shalom Alakam.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:19.440]  I wanted to bring up a couple of points.
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.120]  I saw the X-ray of the device.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:24.840]  I saw no capacitors, I saw no circuit boards.
[01:10:24.840 --> 01:10:28.480]  So I know for a fact, it was no triggering circuit.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:34.000]  And so it's fake as a $3 bill, which,
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.480]  so it's fake, which law enforcement's already saying,
[01:10:36.480 --> 01:10:38.200]  but it's not getting any attention.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.160]  You know, the fact is, okay,
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:44.800]  on top of that, they reported Rice being sent.
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:46.400]  What happened with that story?
[01:10:48.040 --> 01:10:49.760]  Well, they're acting like it's the end of the world
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:52.360]  and the biggest story ever, and it's all built
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:55.240]  on the hoax that these are real bombs,
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:57.920]  and they're not real bombs.
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.640]  We're designed to blow.
[01:10:59.640 --> 01:11:00.680]  That's my point.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.640]  They were designed to instill fear.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.000]  Not like a suicide or a genuine pipe bomb.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.160]  And the fact of the matter is, it's hokey pokey
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:12.360]  because there's no real postmarks on them.
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:14.440]  You know, and usually there's a chain of custody
[01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:15.840]  from the time you drop it off,
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.720]  you show ID at the post office.
[01:11:19.320 --> 01:11:21.000]  What do you think about the pre-programming
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.320]  of the media saying Trump's calling for violence
[01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.360]  when he's not, oh, we're gonna get killed?
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:27.320]  I mean, to me, the pre-programming,
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.120]  that's what really makes this so suspect,
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:30.600]  and then the timing.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.720]  And the American people have such small-term,
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:36.000]  short-term memories, that's the point.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.080]  They don't remember 9-11 in the Stephen Hatfield
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.120]  from right after 9-11, we had the anthrax scares,
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:43.720]  and that was genuine anthrax.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.840]  And this is genuine Ryerson, but this isn't genuine,
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:51.560]  which, again, the whole thing's based on a fraud.
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.440]  The van looks like it's out of central casting,
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.520]  none of it adds up, they're calling him a white guy,
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.800]  he's not, this is crazy, thank you so much, Phil.
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.400]  Okay, Kyle from Pennsylvania says army,
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.440]  says bomb suspect, something not adding up,
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:06.680]  thanks for calling Kyle from Pennsylvania.
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:09.800]  Hey, Alex, it's a pleasure.
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.080]  This looks to me, the guy looks to me
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:14.800]  not as a Trump supporter, but as somebody trying
[01:12:14.800 --> 01:12:18.280]  to intimidate a Trump supporter.
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:22.080]  It would be like if I knew nothing of Star Wars,
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:25.360]  but I went out and got a truck with a lightsaber
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:26.440]  and Darth Vader.
[01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:27.880]  Well, that's it, I mean, the truck,
[01:12:27.880 --> 01:12:31.720]  if you're a real Star Wars fan, it's gonna look old,
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:33.320]  there's gonna be some new, some old.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.760]  This is brand new, central casting, perfectly wrapped,
[01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.560]  looks like it's never even been rained on.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.800]  Well, I guarantee you that if he's been
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.800]  to Trump events in the past, he's some sort of asset
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:49.960]  where that fan can be seen on TV,
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.520]  look at what these people represent.
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.560]  This is horrible, this is the-
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.640]  No, I agree, is he some type of deep state plant,
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.680]  MS-13 operative that we know the Democrats
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:59.560]  are working on MS-13 and they're willing
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.760]  to take one for the team.
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.760]  He's got all these different identities
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.280]  and that's what my crew was calling him is the long con
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.080]  because he's got two different identities we know of,
[01:13:08.080 --> 01:13:09.640]  one's liberal, one's conservative,
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:11.760]  one's on Twitter, one's on Facebook,
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.280]  and then this just all comes out of central casting.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.200]  And I think the fact that this has broken,
[01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:19.920]  literally, Friday at noon,
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.280]  it shows signs of a failed attempt at propaganda
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.640]  because I could see this being something
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:29.400]  that was supposed to be like the DC sniper,
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:33.800]  13 days of fear, 14 days, and they released it
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:35.120]  and people weren't buying it.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.520]  No, I agree, they could have wound it up
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:39.480]  to like a day before the election and it's a Trump guy,
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:43.160]  but instead they put it on a Friday when they can flush it.
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:45.080]  Yeah, don't go to the polls, there could be bombs
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:46.680]  and just people didn't buy it.
[01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.160]  People said this doesn't make sense.
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.440]  This looks to me like nothing
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.120]  and so they just had to dump it.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.840]  I think you'll be able to tell a lot
[01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:55.600]  by Monday or Tuesday morning
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.560]  if this is still on front pages,
[01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.200]  if this is still on news,
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.280]  then hey, it might just be a gift to the Democrats,
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.800]  but if it goes away as quickly as it came,
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:07.240]  you know for a fact that they don't want
[01:14:07.240 --> 01:14:08.600]  a hard look at this guy.
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.400]  Man, that's why I love taking calls
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.440]  from military police, you guys are really smart
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.680]  and that's exactly what I'm seeing here.
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:17.360]  And I'm not just seeing what I wanna see.
[01:14:17.360 --> 01:14:20.680]  How obvious is this that they hype up
[01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:22.000]  that we're gonna do violence against them
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.400]  when they're the ones doing violence,
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.840]  they're losing their bite with the immigrant caravan,
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:29.160]  all this and now right on time,
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.200]  here comes this central casting gleaming van
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:35.480]  with brand new wraps on it and all of this,
[01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.560]  it's just, it's so fake.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.520]  I would go back and look at the 2016 election
[01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:44.400]  and let's see if this guy isn't showing up
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.240]  at some of these events where provocateurs were sending
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:51.080]  that we know were there from the leaked emails.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.680]  I wouldn't be surprised if this guy had a few tussles
[01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.840]  under his belt back in 2016.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:15:01.320]  He looks to me like somebody who's been used
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.760]  for a long amount of time with the opposition.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.040]  Absolutely and now they're flushing him down the commode.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:08.560]  I mean, who knows what's gonna happen.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:11.480]  All I know is it's fake, any other observations?
[01:15:11.480 --> 01:15:12.520]  This is the hell, Mary.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:16.480]  If this doesn't get them what they need
[01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:20.320]  for bad visuals and propaganda against Trump,
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:24.280]  then nothing will, but if it does turn out to be legit
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:27.440]  and this guy is just some knucklehead Trump supporter,
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.680]  obviously he's not the standard bearer for Trump supporters.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.840]  And he's not gonna have a gleaming white vehicle.
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:35.240]  He makes all these mistakes with the bombs
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:36.600]  where it's so obvious to get caught
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:39.200]  that it's gleaming perfect white vehicle right on time.
[01:15:39.200 --> 01:15:42.000]  And then again, what real Trump supporter would make
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:45.440]  Hillary and Soros sympathetic characters?
[01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:49.200]  He, this is the worst thing a Trump supporter would do
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.080]  and it walks right into all their prescripting.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.720]  No, it's fake.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.520]  It's a Hail Mary, great points, Kyle.
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:15:56.640]  Wow, more great calls straight ahead.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.040]  Hear that?
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:01.120]  That's the sound of a house being trashed
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:04.400]  while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.240]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:10.800]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in.
[01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:13.440]  Go to faketv.com and discover a device
[01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.680]  that creates the illusion someone inside is watching TV,
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:18.360]  even when you're miles away.
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.920]  Security is a mindset
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:23.000]  and fake TV should be part of your security solution.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.400]  Be vigilant, but not fearful.
[01:16:25.400 --> 01:16:27.360]  FakeTV.com.
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:29.760]  The United States of Empire is a book
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:33.680]  that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.720]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.040]  The United States of Empire shows
[01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:42.560]  that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:46.400]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:47.720]  Was there ever a vote?
[01:16:47.720 --> 01:16:49.040]  Who do we fight for?
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.960]  The deep state began with World War I,
[01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.200]  the United States of Empire by James Dunn,
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.400]  available at Amazon Books.
[01:16:57.400 --> 01:16:59.280]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.800]  to have a sustainable backup method
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:02.160]  to cook food and boil water.
[01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:05.000]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.560]  or cooking over an open fire,
[01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:08.080]  then there's a much better way.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.400]  The Minuteman Rocket Stove
[01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:11.360]  is a biomass-burning cooking stove
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:13.560]  that only requires small quantities of sticks
[01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.600]  and twigs for fuel.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.440]  The Minuteman Stove is easy to use,
[01:17:16.440 --> 01:17:18.640]  smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.680]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.240]  and fire starters made right here in the USA,

[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:00.960]  They now know that Info Wars has the spirit
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.480]  to relaunch it all,
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:05.520]  and that's why they treat us like we're death.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:07.480]  To George Soros, and to Hillary Clinton,
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:09.320]  to Barack Obama, and to Lord Rothschild,
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:12.480]  I'm the grim reaper, come to their door.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:15.320]  I'm death, and they know it, I'm death of their system.

[01:18:45.280 --> 01:18:46.960]  and that lets us stand against the enemy,
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:48.560]  which infuriates them.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:50.520]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos
[01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:54.000]  of 90% of the Trump supporters being huge Info Wars supporters?
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:55.160]  It scared them to death,
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:56.720]  that's why they want to extinguish us,
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.320]  but you won't let them.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:01.000]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:03.600]  for the future of humanity right now.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:06.760]  Info Wars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party,
[01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:09.840]  left to CIA operatives, the corrupt justice department,
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.360]  and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:14.320]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.800]  Because they were already dominating
[01:19:15.800 --> 01:19:17.760]  and running America into the ground,
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:20.360]  and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.680]  So we've already had incredible success,
[01:19:22.680 --> 01:19:26.000]  but if you will simply realize how epic this is,
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.640]  and understand how real this fight is,
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.200]  and why we've been made the main target,
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:31.680]  and if you financially support us,
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:34.480]  and if you spread the word about our articles and videos,

[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.160]  against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:44.080]  We have huge sales, infowars.com right now,
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:46.160]  and we're still able to operate the shopping cart,
[01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:47.520]  get stuff shipped out to you,
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:49.360]  despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce,
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.200]  and you're right to the market.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.360]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially,
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.920]  Soros and Globalist may win.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.280]  This is Info Wars Darker Sour, we're your support,
[01:19:57.280 --> 01:19:58.280]  I'm counting on you.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:32.880]  Well, we're taking amazing phone calls from law enforcement,
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:34.880]  and current and former military,
[01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:38.680]  and we're gonna have Dr. Steve Pacinic pop back in.
[01:20:38.680 --> 01:20:40.680]  We're gonna get Matt Bracken to pop back in,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.480]  but I'm not gonna keep them too long,
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:43.680]  I'm gonna skip their quick comments,
[01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:46.080]  and get back to calls, because your calls are amazing.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:48.080]  They're bringing up so many points,
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:50.280]  a lot of which I thought about, but not articulated,
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.880]  and that's why this is so crazy,
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.680]  is you look at something, and you say,
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.280]  well, how do you know it's fake?
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:58.480]  It's like, where do you start?
[01:20:58.480 --> 01:21:00.280]  You don't know exactly what's going on,
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:03.280]  but none of it adds up, it's ridiculous.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:06.280]  And why would a Trump supporter bomb and do this?
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:07.280]  And then it's not real bombs,
[01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:09.280]  and then they're all pre-programming,
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:10.280]  and it's coming, and it's imminent,
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.280]  and when it comes, it's our fault.
[01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.280]  And they're, of course, blaming Rush Limbaugh,
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.280]  and Matt Drudge, and myself, and President Trump,
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.280]  and there's no talk of Scalise, no talk of Rand Paul,
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:22.280]  no talk of the ICE people getting killed,
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.280]  no talk of cops that are murder, you know,
[01:21:24.280 --> 01:21:27.280]  five cops get shot, there's hardly any coverage,
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:29.280]  by Black Lives Matter.
[01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:32.280]  And then this, nobody gets hurt, it's fake bombs,
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:34.280]  it's like the end of the world,
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.280]  and the Democrats are gonna win now,
[01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:41.280]  it's ridiculous, it's ridiculous.
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:43.280]  It's like you got suicide bombings every day,
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:46.280]  sometimes 500, 1,000 dead,
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:49.280]  usually it's a couple dozen dead a day in the Middle East,
[01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.280]  there's just bombings everywhere.
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:52.280]  Sometimes when Ramadan starts,
[01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:55.280]  they all go crazy and it's a couple thousand dead.
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:57.280]  It's been thousands dead one day before.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.280]  We'll blip in the news.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.280]  This Khashoggi guy,
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.280]  because he's obviously intelligence on the left,
[01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.280]  and that's come out, he gets killed,
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:05.280]  it's like the end of the world,
[01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.280]  and I'm not saying it's a good thing,
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:11.280]  but it's all done for PR reasons.
[01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:14.280]  And you know when it's PR, 14 days out,
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.280]  all the people under major heat,
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:19.280]  the caravan exposing their invasion plan,
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:22.280]  pole showing major red wave surge
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:25.280]  that could get us over the blue sea wall,
[01:22:25.280 --> 01:22:27.280]  and boom this hits.
[01:22:27.280 --> 01:22:31.280]  And now, notice that it's brand new stickers,
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:34.280]  it's not bleached out in the Florida sun,
[01:22:34.280 --> 01:22:39.280]  it looks like a brand new Ferrari in the showroom.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:42.280]  I mean it's a brand new white van, brand new wraps,
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:44.280]  all perfectly done, all clean,
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.280]  so the cameras can pick it all up and see what it is.
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.280]  It's like this Easter egg of disinfo,
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:51.280]  with all the crosshairs on Hillary,
[01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:53.280]  and crosshairs on Michael Moore,
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280]  and crosshairs on Van Jones,
[01:22:54.280 --> 01:22:57.280]  making all the real enemies of America victims,
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:00.280]  and crosshairs on Soros.
[01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.280]  Just like his son says,
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:02.280]  just like the op-ed say,
[01:23:02.280 --> 01:23:06.280]  it's all flawlessly coming together
[01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:09.280]  right before the midterms.
[01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:13.280]  That's like when I saw Hillary Clinton
[01:23:13.280 --> 01:23:15.280]  town hall event,
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:18.280]  and I was walking by at my house one night,
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:20.280]  back in 2016, about a month before the election,
[01:23:20.280 --> 01:23:24.280]  I went, God, that's not even 35 millimeter,
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:27.280]  that's 80 millimeter digital equivalent.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:29.280]  I was like, it looks so perfect,
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:31.280]  you see like dust in the air,
[01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:33.280]  and they said it was a live event,
[01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.280]  and the cuts were so perfect, and the flash bulbs,
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.280]  and I was like, Stanley Kubrick
[01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.280]  couldn't make something this good,
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:41.280]  it's obviously fake.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.280]  And I said, that's fake.
[01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:46.280]  After the election, it came out
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:49.280]  that that exact town hall
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:53.280]  had been shot months before with actors,
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:55.280]  and that they brought in major directors,
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.280]  and that there was some huge,
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.280]  that was like a $10 million budget that memory serves
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:03.280]  for a $10 million budget.
[01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:07.280]  So you know when you see slick,
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.280]  you know when you see real,
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:12.280]  and you've got this perfect vehicle with perfect wraps,
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:15.280]  none of it's damaged in the Florida sun.
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:17.280]  Let me tell you, you park in the Florida sun
[01:24:17.280 --> 01:24:19.280]  a wrap like that for a day,
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.280]  it's going to have bubbles.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:22.280]  It's not going to look like that.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:25.280]  This was in a warehouse waiting.
[01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.280]  Oh, try in South Florida,
[01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:30.280]  Liberalville, not the Panhandle, it's conservative.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.280]  You try parking that outside.
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:34.280]  Let me tell you something.
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.280]  I didn't make a big deal about this,
[01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:38.280]  but in 2016 I had a Trump sticker on my car,
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.280]  and a Hillary for prison.
[01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:42.280]  That's what happened to my car, not once but twice.
[01:24:42.280 --> 01:24:45.280]  I had my tires knifed,
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.280]  and then I had a window knocked out and keyed.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:52.280]  How the hell was that driving around
[01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:55.280]  in South Florida, the equivalent of Austin, Texas,
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.280]  and not being attacked?
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:25:00.280]  You know, I thought,
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:01.280]  because I don't go to leftist areas,
[01:25:01.280 --> 01:25:03.280]  that I could go to the grocery store,
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.280]  you know, go to the, you know, whatever,
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:06.280]  and no, no, no.
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.280]  I barely drove around for two weeks
[01:25:08.280 --> 01:25:10.280]  and had to take the sticker off,
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.280]  which I didn't like doing.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:14.280]  All right, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.280]  I apologize. Your calls are amazing.
[01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.280]  So I'm going to just, as fast as I can,
[01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.280]  because all these callers, those last two were amazing.
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.280]  We're just going to go to everybody when we come back,
[01:25:22.280 --> 01:25:24.280]  because this is only three minutes to break,
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:26.280]  and when we come back, I'm going to go directly to you.
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:30.280]  It's just, this is insane.
[01:25:30.280 --> 01:25:32.280]  Again, why would a Trump supporter
[01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.280]  do something like this?
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:37.280]  And of course, they're not going to cook up
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:39.280]  some real truck with a bunch of old stickers on it,
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.280]  some new, some old.
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:42.280]  Everybody knows the right-winger vehicles
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.280]  that you see with 100 bumper stickers on them.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.280]  Some of them look like they're, you know,
[01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:51.280]  old, some are brand new.
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:53.280]  Yeah, remember the guy had a couple of Trump stickers
[01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:55.280]  and his truck just got torched.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:57.280]  Are you kidding, folks?
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280]  If you put stickers in years past
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.280]  against Save Our Springs,
[01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:01.280]  that's the environmental group
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:03.280]  that steals all the land for developers,
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:05.280]  they'll slash your tires so quick
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:07.280]  and they'll make your head spin.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:10.280]  So again, they will burn your vehicle up
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.280]  if you've got two stickers on your car.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:14.280]  They will smash the windows out.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:17.280]  How in the world in South Florida
[01:26:17.280 --> 01:26:19.280]  was this guy driving around?
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:21.280]  We're going to go to break and come back,
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:25.280]  and I'm telling you, just as big as Dallas.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.280]  This is a test, like I said on Monday,
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:29.280]  to see if we buy into it,
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:31.280]  and if it hurts Republicans and polls,
[01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.280]  which it's doing for real.
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:35.280]  It's so ridiculous.
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:37.280]  Then they may do the big one.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.280]  Truck bomb or mass shooting.
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:41.280]  So just get ready.
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.280]  And the left's gotten smart enough
[01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:45.280]  to find operatives they've got,
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.280]  informants, patsies, you name it,
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.280]  who are willing and ready
[01:26:49.280 --> 01:26:52.280]  to go to prison to bring down this country.
[01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:53.280]  And they finally got,
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:26:55.280]  like the Muslims have suicide bombers,
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.280]  it's the equivalent.
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:58.280]  They're political bombers
[01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:00.280]  who are willing to do false flags
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:03.280]  and even take the blame to burn us.
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:08.280]  What conservative in the universe
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:11.280]  would send pipe bombs to Hillary Clinton?
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.280]  And let me tell you,
[01:27:13.280 --> 01:27:14.280]  if they were going to do it,
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:16.280]  they wouldn't send fake ones.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.280]  That's not how conservatives operate.
[01:27:18.280 --> 01:27:19.280]  We're going to break.
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:20.280]  I don't want any violence.
[01:27:20.280 --> 01:27:22.280]  I hope Hillary can live a long life
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.280]  to get into going to federal prison.
[01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.280]  Lock her up.
[01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:27.280]  Remember, free shipping's tour-wide.

[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:45.280]  because they took
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:47.280]  five of our payment processors
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:27:49.280]  and we got down to one.
[01:27:49.280 --> 01:27:51.280]  And then we got two more
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:52.280]  and got contracts
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.280]  that they won't go under political correctness.
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.280]  And I don't want to say we're even safe at this point,
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:27:58.280]  this is the harassment and the racketeering
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:00.280]  and the economic terrorism we're under.
[01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:02.280]  But these mega-sales, we've already sold out.
[01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.280]  We had stuff budgeted at the end of the year
[01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:06.280]  to be able to sell what we have by the end of the year.
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.280]  So I just did most of our sales already.
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:10.280]  And I have to end them
[01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.280]  because we're about to sell out of X2.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:12.280]  That is the final run.
[01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:14.280]  We're about to sell out of
[01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:15.280]  bodies, ultimate tumor reform.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:17.280]  We're about to sell out of MycoZX.
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:18.280]  We're about to sell out of the toothpaste,
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.280]  fluoride-free, colloidal, silver, iodine,
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.280]  fortified, super blue.
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:24.280]  We're about to sell out of
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:26.280]  a BrainForce Plus with 20% more in each bottle,
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.280]  the amazing nitropic.
[01:28:27.280 --> 01:28:29.280]  Leading competitors are twice as much at regular price.
[01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:32.280]  50% off, you cannot beat BrainForce at this deal.
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:34.280]  So, you can also call
[01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:36.280]  888-253-33139.

[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:46.280]  which infuriates them.
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.280]  You know how scared they were of all those live videos
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.280]  of 90% of the Trump supporters being huge
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.280]  Infowars supporters?
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:54.280]  It scared them to death.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:56.280]  That's why they want to extinguish us.
[01:30:56.280 --> 01:30:58.280]  But you won't let them.

[01:33:00.280 --> 01:33:02.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:33:02.280 --> 01:33:12.280]  show.
[01:33:12.280 --> 01:33:14.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:14.280 --> 01:33:16.280]  It's Friday, October 26th,
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:18.280]  2018. 11 days.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:20.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:22.280]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.280]  I just talked to Roger
[01:33:24.280 --> 01:33:26.280]  Stone. I'm going to give him to
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.280]  pop in. He's an expert on Florida
[01:33:28.280 --> 01:33:30.280]  politics.
[01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.280]  He says
[01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.280]  MSNBC is trying to tie
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:36.280]  arrested bomber to Infowars.
[01:33:36.280 --> 01:33:38.280]  He's just now watching.
[01:33:38.280 --> 01:33:40.280]  Man arrested worked for
[01:33:40.280 --> 01:33:42.280]  Seminole Indian tribe of Florida.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:44.280]  Casino owners and multi-million
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:46.280]  dollar funders of Democratic
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:48.280]  party operatives.
[01:33:48.280 --> 01:33:50.280]  Yeah. And then man,
[01:33:50.280 --> 01:33:52.280]  the magic van, all perfect and clean.
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:54.280]  The big nice wrap. Looks like it's brand
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:56.280]  new.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:58.280]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:33:58.280 --> 01:34:00.280]  All right. Eagle Eye.
[01:34:00.280 --> 01:34:02.280]  Kevin.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.280]  Steven.
[01:34:04.280 --> 01:34:06.280]  There's so many.
[01:34:06.280 --> 01:34:08.280]  Red callers are Daniel,
[01:34:08.280 --> 01:34:10.280]  Ken, Aaron, Vox, Jack, Shane.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:12.280]  Let's just go
[01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:14.280]  from who's been holding the longest
[01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:16.280]  through the next person. Try to move here quickly
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:18.280]  because you know I can babble.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.280]  Let's talk to Shane
[01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.280]  in Florida.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.280]  EOD, ordinance disposal.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.280]  Shane, what's your take on this?
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:28.280]  Alex, look man, this is a script.
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:30.280]  You know how they operate. It's a
[01:34:30.280 --> 01:34:32.280]  suspense thriller with a mind screwed ending.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:34.280]  It's an emotional sigh up.
[01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:36.280]  You know, where's all the heated
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.280]  emotion on both sides right now? It's the caravan.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:40.280]  I think they're going to try to hit
[01:34:40.280 --> 01:34:42.280]  the caravan and they're going to try to
[01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.280]  blame it on a nationalist, a Trump supporter.
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:46.280]  Because what's the ultimate goal?
[01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  To try to delegitimize
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.280]  Trump, try to make him out to be
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:52.280]  evil and try to generate a blue wave
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:54.280]  for the midterm.
[01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:56.280]  That's right. And timing is everything.
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:58.280]  And as one of my crew said, Connor,
[01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:00.280]  this is made for TV stuff.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:02.280]  I mean, this is just
[01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.280]  central casting, central programming,
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:06.280]  how they find the van, how it's rolled out,
[01:35:06.280 --> 01:35:08.280]  the helicopters, everything.
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.280]  The fake bombs, it's incredible.
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.280]  I'm down
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:14.280]  in South Florida, man. I got a bunch
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:16.280]  of, you know, 1776.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:18.280]  Don't tread on me
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.280]  stickers on the back of my Jeep.
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.280]  And I got to replace them every month or two
[01:35:22.280 --> 01:35:24.280]  before they're always peeling off.
[01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.280]  Like you said, that looks like it's
[01:35:26.280 --> 01:35:28.280]  screenshot that's straight out of the factory.
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:30.280]  If they want to catch this guy to see when
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:32.280]  they made those stickers, it won't be hard.
[01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:34.280]  You know, this is Hollywood in the making.
[01:35:34.280 --> 01:35:36.280]  Well, that's exactly what my crew said.
[01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:38.280]  They said ought to offer a $50,000
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:40.280]  reward for the people
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:42.280]  that did that
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.280]  printing for these digital
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:46.280]  wraps from the company and when it was done.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:48.280]  I dare them to come on the show with the proof
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.280]  and when they did this.
[01:35:50.280 --> 01:35:52.280]  They won't do it because it was
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.280]  fabricated in some Hollywood
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.280]  production site. It's ridiculous.
[01:35:56.280 --> 01:35:58.280]  But
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:36:00.280]  the Democrats don't have
[01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:02.280]  any facts right now. They just run on emotions.
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.280]  So they're just trying to connect this patching
[01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.280]  just, you know, to an
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:08.280]  event to try to divert our attention
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:10.280]  off the migrant caravan. And I honestly
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.280]  think that they're going to try to hit
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.280]  the other caravan in order to make
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:16.280]  Trump look, because
[01:36:16.280 --> 01:36:18.280]  what is Trump been running on? We're going to build a wall.
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:20.280]  We can't allow these immigrants. What did Trump
[01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:22.280]  just do? Mattis is now
[01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:24.280]  employing troops down to the border.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.280]  I think it's going to be a rogue military
[01:36:26.280 --> 01:36:28.280]  member or something like that.
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:30.280]  And you already said it. Owen hit on it yesterday.
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:32.280]  They got the bombs already in the trucks.
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:34.280]  I don't put it past them.
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:36.280]  I don't put it past them.
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:38.280]  The good news is
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.280]  if you look at all the comments everywhere
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:42.280]  no one is buying that
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.280]  this is real. The whole thing's so fake.
[01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:46.280]  And now this guy, and they call him white
[01:36:46.280 --> 01:36:48.280]  it's a fake bombs.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:50.280]  He's not white. Every level is BS.
[01:36:50.280 --> 01:36:52.280]  And he worked for
[01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:54.280]  the tribal government
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:36:56.280]  that is the casinos.
[01:36:56.280 --> 01:36:58.280]  And which are total
[01:36:58.280 --> 01:37:00.280]  100% Democrats.
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:02.280]  Look at the timing. Shane, thank you for the great call.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.280]  A lot of great points there.
[01:37:04.280 --> 01:37:06.280]  Okay, who's been holding the next longest?
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:08.280]  Let's talk to
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:10.280]  Ken, who's part of the bomb threat response force
[01:37:12.280 --> 01:37:14.280]  in what group?
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.280]  Ken, what did you do and give us your view on this?
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:18.280]  Yes, sir. I was a fire chief
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:20.280]  trained in bomb threat response in South Carolina
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:22.280]  by the Air Force
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:24.280]  EOD.
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.280]  And you're going to take that slam now
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.280]  for calling a hoax a hoax. And I'm going to give you
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:30.280]  empirical evidence right from the post office itself.
[01:37:30.280 --> 01:37:32.280]  These were not bombs.
[01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.280]  They didn't have a triggering device. They didn't have
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:36.280]  a propellant or an incendiary.
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:38.280]  They didn't have a detonator. That's not a bomb.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:40.280]  If you want to call these pipe bombs, they ain't pipe bombs.
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:42.280]  They're hype bombs. They're bulls.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.280]  And the signs are clear.
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:46.280]  I sent Rob Do a link
[01:37:46.280 --> 01:37:48.280]  to the U.S.
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  Post Office poster number 84.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:52.280]  That's
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.280]  TOS84.PDF.
[01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:56.280]  And look at the picture you can put up on the screen
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:58.280]  of all the telltale signs that it was a suspect
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:00.280]  package to begin with.
[01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:02.280]  Excess postage
[01:38:02.280 --> 01:38:04.280]  that was not canceled by the post office
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.280]  so that it would make for sure we go through the mail,
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:08.280]  but it wasn't even sent by the Postal Service.
[01:38:08.280 --> 01:38:10.280]  Printed out big labels so that the address
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:12.280]  even though there's misspellings in the name,
[01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:14.280]  the address is clear so that they make it
[01:38:14.280 --> 01:38:16.280]  to the right location.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.280]  And the
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:20.280]  the other one right out of the manual.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.280]  No, I understand. The labels are fake.
[01:38:24.280 --> 01:38:26.280]  They're not bombs. I understand.
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:28.280]  Law enforcement has said there was no explosive.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:30.280]  There's not even a detonator.
[01:38:30.280 --> 01:38:32.280]  Alex is going to blow your mind.
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:34.280]  Get the crew to do the search
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.280]  for suspect package
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.280]  U.S.P.S.
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:40.280]  and put Postal Number 84 up on the screen
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:42.280]  for everybody to see. You could overlay
[01:38:42.280 --> 01:38:44.280]  that Manila envelope right over
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.280]  their example of a suspect package.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:48.280]  These were decoys Alex.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:50.280]  They were never intended to blow up. You called it
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:52.280]  from day one. They were made
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.280]  that you could see them across the room.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:38:56.280]  In fact, if I was the fire chief in charge of that scene,
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:58.280]  I wouldn't have been back. You wouldn't have been building in a hurry
[01:38:58.280 --> 01:39:00.280]  because I don't look at it as a decoy device.
[01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:02.280]  It was just a diversion and that there's some other
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:04.280]  explosive device somewhere else that's real
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:06.280]  and that these were made to get us to go into
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:08.280]  the usual protocols
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:10.280]  to bottleneck everybody out that took points
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:12.280]  and bottlenecks where they could get killed by real devices.
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:14.280]  And let's be clear.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.280]  You're trained in this. We're putting up the official poster
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:18.280]  where they train people in the post office
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.280]  and you're right. Just like the Navy SEALs
[01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.280]  try to sneak fake bombs through things
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:24.280]  for training and the military
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.280]  and the ATF does it. You're right.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:28.280]  This looks like it was someone trained
[01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:30.280]  in how to put a decoy in
[01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:32.280]  to see if people trained in class would catch it.
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.280]  Which again,
[01:39:34.280 --> 01:39:36.280]  hooks into our friends at the
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.280]  DOJ controlled by the Clintons.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.280]  And don't tell me
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:42.280]  that reporter that posted it, criminally negligent
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:44.280]  posted that picture of the suspect device.
[01:39:44.280 --> 01:39:46.280]  Didn't know how to
[01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.280]  identify a suspect package
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.280]  when he works at a major news outlet like that.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:52.280]  I mean, that's total bull.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:54.280]  And we know that these devices all arrived
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:56.280]  at the same time. This
[01:39:56.280 --> 01:39:58.280]  seminal guy, Syok
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.280]  could not have hit all these locations
[01:40:00.280 --> 01:40:02.280]  at the same time. Obviously
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:04.280]  he's got help.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:06.280]  So, I might be
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.280]  the bomber apparently. I'm glad I sold my
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.280]  white van that I used to work years ago.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:12.280]  But I think you hit the nail on the head here, Ken.
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:14.280]  Hold on, Ken. You're right.
[01:40:14.280 --> 01:40:16.280]  I said that if we buy into this
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:18.280]  gut level, there's something bigger coming
[01:40:18.280 --> 01:40:20.280]  and you're saying you think that as well.
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.280]  Yes, sir. This is all a decoy.
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:24.280]  This is
[01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.280]  Steve Pachinicson I covered a minute. When they want you
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:28.280]  to look at your left, the left hand, look at the left hand,
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:30.280]  look at the left hand, check the right hand
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:32.280]  too late. Because the blow, the punch
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:34.280]  is coming from the right hand.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:36.280]  And all of this, that far to suspect,
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.280]  I cannot believe the president
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:40.280]  bought into it, but there's always a push to
[01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:42.280]  find the guilty party. He should not.
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:44.280]  What they're doing is they're putting pressure on him
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.280]  like he's guilty. And so, if he
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  says, I think this is bull, of course he knows it's bull,
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:50.280]  then they're going to attack him and go after him.
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:52.280]  So, he's trying to just tamp it down.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:54.280]  But I agree. Once we agree it's the right
[01:40:54.280 --> 01:40:56.280]  wing, once they get us
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:40:58.280]  seeing the leftist victims and buying that narrative,
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:00.280]  then the big attack comes.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:02.280]  You can see the veiled up. That's why they want me
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.280]  shut down. They don't want people to know
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.280]  what's going on. So, they don't hear this debate
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:08.280]  when they pull this crap off.
[01:41:08.280 --> 01:41:10.280]  God bless you. I appreciate your call, Ken. Another
[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:12.280]  amazing caller.
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:14.280]  Let's do one more call before we go to break here
[01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.280]  next one. Steve
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.280]  in Indiana, thank you for holding Air Force
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:20.280]  DOD, bombing suspect
[01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:22.280]  topic. Go ahead, please.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:24.280]  Hey, Alex, how you doing? Good.
[01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.280]  Good.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.280]  I called in yesterday about this whole thing
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:30.280]  and this just added
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.280]  fuel to the fire of what I was
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:34.280]  thinking. It finally
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:36.280]  came to my mind what I was thinking yesterday.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.280]  All of this is so
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:40.280]  perfect. Like you said about the van and
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.280]  the guy and the
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:44.280]  rhetoric and the bombs and all of this.
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:46.280]  Back when
[01:41:46.280 --> 01:41:48.280]  I was doing DOD work, we didn't
[01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:50.280]  investigate like a detective would,
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:52.280]  but we did a lot of intelligence work.
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:54.280]  And this is what we would call an orgy
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.280]  of evidence. It's like
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.280]  too perfect.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:00.280]  It's too perfect. There's too much stuff
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.280]  here.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.280]  They didn't leave anything to be
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:06.280]  like, gee, what about this?
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:08.280]  We would expect to maybe find this, but we don't
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.280]  see that. Everything lines up
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.280]  perfectly.
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:14.280]  And it's too perfect.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:16.280]  It's like you've been saying, it's like scripted.
[01:42:16.280 --> 01:42:18.280]  It's like somebody
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:20.280]  went through the checkboxes and went,
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:22.280]  okay, we've got
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.280]  that looks white, but isn't really white.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:26.280]  We've got the bombs that look like
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:28.280]  bombs, but they're overdone and they look
[01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.280]  ridiculous. Stay there. I want to come back
[01:42:30.280 --> 01:42:32.280]  and have you finish. Roger Stone's
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:34.280]  popping in for like five minutes on the
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:36.280]  seminal gangster connection
[01:42:36.280 --> 01:42:38.280]  and the massive Democratic funding
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:40.280]  by the casinos and a little more calls, but
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:42.280]  stay there. Yeah, it's like when I saw
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:44.280]  the Hillary so-called Live Town Hall,
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.280]  I said, that's not live.
[01:42:46.280 --> 01:42:48.280]  Those are actors and that's shot in the
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.280]  highest definition I've ever seen.
[01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:52.280]  It was later because we all know
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:54.280]  what we're seeing. We're not stupid
[01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:56.280]  if we're conscious.
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:42:58.280]  We're bringing back
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:00.280]  one of the biggest fan favorite formulas
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:02.280]  we've ever offered with even better

[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:06.280]  broth.

[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:36.280]  This incredible chicken bone

[01:45:24.280 --> 01:45:26.280]  epic this is and understand

[01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:38.280]  just continue to stand up against these
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:40.280]  brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:42.280]  We have huge sales at InfowarsStore.com

[01:46:48.280 --> 01:47:00.280]  But you are the folks that have stood with us.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:16.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:20.280]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:22.280]  The preacher man says it's the end of time.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:30.280]  And the Mississippi River, she's a gold grime.
[01:47:30.280 --> 01:47:34.280]  The interest is up and the stock market's down.
[01:47:34.280 --> 01:47:38.280]  And you're only getting mugged if you go downtown.
[01:47:38.280 --> 01:47:40.280]  Well, we're taking your phone calls. Roger
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:42.280]  Stone's popping in for like five minutes via
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.280]  foam, Matt Bracken in one segment.
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:47:46.280]  He's probably going to pop in.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:48.280]  He's going to get back to his house.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:50.280]  He's in Florida.
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:47:54.280]  And we will give you their expert takes on this.
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:47:56.280]  But this whole thing is too perfect.
[01:47:56.280 --> 01:47:58.280]  That's what it's called an orgy of evidence.
[01:47:58.280 --> 01:48:02.280]  Just like with the situation you saw with Vegas.
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:04.280]  Oh, it's all him.
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:06.280]  But then there's all this other evidence around
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.280]  that they don't want you to look at.
[01:48:08.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  And suddenly that story gets shut down.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:12.280]  But not this one.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:14.280]  I mean, we're in the middle world and Trump
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:16.280]  and Republicans are violent.
[01:48:16.280 --> 01:48:18.280]  And we're sorry we called for violence,
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:20.280]  which we didn't do.
[01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:22.280]  And then the big event comes.
[01:48:22.280 --> 01:48:24.280]  You can see it.
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:26.280]  I mean, they don't go on every news channel.
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:28.280]  I mean, every major news channel from CBS
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:34.280]  to ABC to CNN to MSNBC to PBS to MPR.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:36.280]  I mean, my wife listens to MPR.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:38.280]  She doesn't believe it, but that's what she's
[01:48:38.280 --> 01:48:40.280]  listening to, you know, for news.
[01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:42.280]  Every news segment saying you're saying
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:44.280]  kill people, but you didn't say that.
[01:48:44.280 --> 01:48:46.280]  And I'm like, yeah, they're getting ready to set me up.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:48.280]  This is months ago.
[01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:50.280]  And sure enough, I'm either making myself the topic.
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.280]  It's all over the news.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:48:54.280]  Roger Stone just saw on MSNBC
[01:48:54.280 --> 01:48:56.280]  that I'm causing this because I said
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.280]  George Soros was a Nazi.
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:00.280]  He said he helped round people up
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:02.280]  on 60 minutes.
[01:49:02.280 --> 01:49:04.280]  So now because he got nailed
[01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:06.280]  a fake firecracker,
[01:49:06.280 --> 01:49:08.280]  these fake
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:10.280]  road flare bombs we made
[01:49:10.280 --> 01:49:12.280]  are more dangerous
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.280]  because they actually can like these and do something
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:16.280]  than the crap that got sent.
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:18.280]  So shopping bags about to happen.
[01:49:18.280 --> 01:49:20.280]  They don't go on every channel
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:22.280]  and say that Trump and Alex Jones are calling for violence
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:24.280]  when we're not for no reason.
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:26.280]  They're setting us up.
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:28.280]  So how do we handle this? How do we respond?
[01:49:28.280 --> 01:49:30.280]  Go ahead and finish up, Steve. I appreciate you holding.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:32.280]  We're making some great points. Go ahead.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:34.280]  Former Air Force DoD bomb expert.
[01:49:34.280 --> 01:49:36.280]  Yeah.
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:38.280]  I think the best way to handle it, Alex,
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:40.280]  I was thinking about this over the break
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:42.280]  is we need to
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:44.280]  talk to people.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:46.280]  This whole thing was made
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:48.280]  for a culture that was raised on TV.
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:50.280]  You know, they're looking at this stuff
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:52.280]  and they see the same stuff they see on TV
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:54.280]  and they go, oh my gosh, it's like,
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.280]  that's just like that CSI episode that I saw.
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:58.280]  We need to talk to them
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:00.280]  and explain to them how fake this really is
[01:50:00.280 --> 01:50:02.280]  and what it's doing and how it's manipulating them
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.280]  to try to get them to vote a certain way
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:06.280]  or to
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:08.280]  choose a certain party or
[01:50:08.280 --> 01:50:10.280]  whatever.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:12.280]  You know, it's trying to get their attention off
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.280]  of what's really important
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:16.280]  and it's the things that you've been talking about for years
[01:50:16.280 --> 01:50:18.280]  that the globalists are taking over
[01:50:18.280 --> 01:50:20.280]  that they're trying to steal our liberty,
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.280]  they're trying to take our free speech,
[01:50:22.280 --> 01:50:24.280]  they're trying to take our guns
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.280]  and we
[01:50:26.280 --> 01:50:28.280]  we take
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:30.280]  to get people to understand
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:32.280]  that this is really happening.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:34.280]  This is not a dream.
[01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:36.280]  This is not some conspiracy theory.
[01:50:36.280 --> 01:50:38.280]  This is real. It's real.
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:40.280]  That's right. Remember, Trump had only been in office
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:42.280]  a few weeks
[01:50:42.280 --> 01:50:44.280]  and somebody was defacing Jewish centers
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:46.280]  and knocking over hundreds of Jewish Timstones
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:48.280]  and Trump talked to federal law enforcement
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:50.280]  and they said, yeah, we have a suspect.
[01:50:50.280 --> 01:50:52.280]  It's the left doings themselves.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.280]  So he said on the news, on Fox and Friends,
[01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:56.280]  I think somebody, some leftist is doing this
[01:50:56.280 --> 01:50:58.280]  to blame me.
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:00.280]  And he got out there, he had to do a special
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:02.280]  early
[01:51:02.280 --> 01:51:04.280]  state of the union to say,
[01:51:04.280 --> 01:51:06.280]  oh, and I believe that there's anti-Semitism
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:08.280]  and you shouldn't deface Jewish centers.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:10.280]  And then it turned out a month later
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:12.280]  that it was a leftist Jewish man
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:14.280]  doing it to blame Trump.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:16.280]  Did that get any coverage? No, it was in the New Jersey papers.
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:18.280]  But no other
[01:51:18.280 --> 01:51:20.280]  Drudge Report linked to it. We talked about it.
[01:51:20.280 --> 01:51:22.280]  But that's what I mean. No one remembers
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.280]  when it comes out later, it's them.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:26.280]  The Air Force Academy.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.280]  Someone's putting on the vending machines,
[01:51:28.280 --> 01:51:30.280]  no inwards allowed
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.280]  and it was a black leftist.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:34.280]  I mean like 95%
[01:51:34.280 --> 01:51:36.280]  when are there
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:38.280]  poop swastikas that someone really did it?
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:40.280]  I mean
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.280]  when does someone really burn across
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:44.280]  in a yard now or burn down a black church?
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:46.280]  Every time
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:48.280]  they catch the left doing it to be the victims.
[01:51:48.280 --> 01:51:50.280]  God bless you, Steve. I appreciate your call.
[01:51:50.280 --> 01:51:52.280]  Amazing callers.
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:54.280]  And we're going to go to
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:56.280]  Kevin next
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:58.280]  and then Eagle Eye and just in the order you called him
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:00.280]  we'll go to all these great people. Vox, Vox
[01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:02.280]  is actually next. And then we'll go to Eagle Eye
[01:52:02.280 --> 01:52:04.280]  and then Kevin and others.
[01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:06.280]  But I wanted to bring Roger Stone on for just five minutes
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:08.280]  because he's watching MSNBC.
[01:52:08.280 --> 01:52:10.280]  He saw this and he's also an expert on the political
[01:52:10.280 --> 01:52:12.280]  groups
[01:52:12.280 --> 01:52:14.280]  and constellations and make up of Florida
[01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:16.280]  and he has something to say about
[01:52:16.280 --> 01:52:18.280]  the Patsy, the
[01:52:18.280 --> 01:52:20.280]  the identified
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:22.280]  bomber
[01:52:22.280 --> 01:52:24.280]  here, the new Tim McVeigh, the new
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:26.280]  Lee Harvey Oswald, the new Sirhan Sirhan,
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.280]  suspect
[01:52:28.280 --> 01:52:30.280]  Mel Bomber identified as Caesar Altair
[01:52:30.280 --> 01:52:32.280]  Syok
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:34.280]  and he worked for the tribal government of the
[01:52:34.280 --> 01:52:36.280]  Seminoles.
[01:52:36.280 --> 01:52:38.280]  So what is your first observations of this
[01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:40.280]  Roger Stone?
[01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:42.280]  Well Alex
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:44.280]  obviously all of this
[01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:46.280]  breaking news coming very quickly
[01:52:46.280 --> 01:52:48.280]  in order to try to get the American people
[01:52:48.280 --> 01:52:50.280]  to rush to a judgment
[01:52:50.280 --> 01:52:52.280]  that these
[01:52:52.280 --> 01:52:54.280]  bombs were placed
[01:52:54.280 --> 01:52:56.280]  by some rabid Trump supporter.
[01:52:56.280 --> 01:52:58.280]  The mainstream media
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.280]  has turned up some photographs
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:02.280]  that appear to show him
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:04.280]  at a MAGA rally
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:06.280]  and we're told that
[01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:08.280]  his van or his car
[01:53:08.280 --> 01:53:10.280]  had Trump bumper stickers. However
[01:53:10.280 --> 01:53:12.280]  it is interesting to me that he works
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:14.280]  as an employee for the
[01:53:14.280 --> 01:53:16.280]  Seminole Indian tribe
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:18.280]  of Florida. These are
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:20.280]  mega mega wealthy
[01:53:20.280 --> 01:53:22.280]  casino owners
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:24.280]  and heavy heavy funders, multimillion
[01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:26.280]  dollar funders over the years
[01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.280]  of democratic party operations.
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:30.280]  I find that to be
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:32.280]  an interesting anomaly.
[01:53:32.280 --> 01:53:34.280]  Why would someone like that
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:36.280]  employ some rabid
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:38.280]  Trump supporter? It's illogical
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:40.280]  and it may be
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.280]  the thread that those who are trying
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:44.280]  to unravel what has really
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:48.280]  happened here should pull out.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:50.280]  But look at the timing. Look at the
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.280]  pre-programming. We've been predicting this was coming.
[01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:54.280]  This is incredibly synthetic, Roger.
[01:53:54.280 --> 01:53:56.280]  Well, and this guy
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:58.280]  looks to me like he's set up by a patsy.
[01:53:58.280 --> 01:54:00.280]  Let me note that as far as I
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:02.280]  understand he is in the custody
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.280]  right now of
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.280]  Broward County Democratic
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:08.280]  Chair of Scott Israel
[01:54:08.280 --> 01:54:10.280]  who was somewhat controversial earlier
[01:54:10.280 --> 01:54:12.280]  this year in his advocacy
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:14.280]  of taking away our Second Amendment
[01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:16.280]  rights. And they're the same ones that admittedly
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:18.280]  stood down
[01:54:18.280 --> 01:54:20.280]  and let happen what happened and have been
[01:54:20.280 --> 01:54:22.280]  Oh, isn't it funny? Everything
[01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:24.280]  magically happens in that trusted
[01:54:24.280 --> 01:54:26.280]  county.
[01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:28.280]  It is very ironic
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:30.280]  and we await a report from
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:32.280]  the Florida Department of Law Enforcement
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:34.280]  which I had hoped would be out
[01:54:34.280 --> 01:54:36.280]  before this election
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:38.280]  but it is undisputed that
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:40.280]  the operation was bungled
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:42.280]  at Parkland
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:44.280]  School
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:46.280]  where we had these tragic shootings.
[01:54:46.280 --> 01:54:48.280]  This is a partisan elected
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:50.280]  Democrat who I actually
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:54:52.280]  know and
[01:54:52.280 --> 01:54:54.280]  the reputed bomber, the alleged
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:56.280]  bomber is in his
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.280]  custody. I'd like to know more
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.280]  about who made the arrest
[01:55:00.280 --> 01:55:02.280]  where the... Exactly who had the tip
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:04.280]  and who found this van that's all perfect
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:06.280]  and brand new with all these perfect stickers on it.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.280]  Well, I hadn't put two and two together, Roger
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:10.280]  Broward
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:12.280]  County, the leftist stand-down
[01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.280]  sheriff.
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:16.280]  That's where you live. I know up front
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:18.280]  you'd kind of been a little bit supportive because your son
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:20.280]  is a deputy there
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:22.280]  but then you had to admit later, no, it looks like a stand-down.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:24.280]  Wow, this really
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:26.280]  stinks to Ivan now, Roger.
[01:55:26.280 --> 01:55:28.280]  Yeah, I didn't like the prior Republican
[01:55:28.280 --> 01:55:30.280]  sheriff because he turned out to be corrupt
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:32.280]  in all honesty so therefore I will vote
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:34.280]  for honesty over corruption
[01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:36.280]  but in this case I find this
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:38.280]  suspicious. Where did the... Who found
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:40.280]  this guy? Who apprehended him? Was it the FBI?
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:42.280]  Or was he apprehended
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:44.280]  by the Broward County Sheriff's Office
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:46.280]  and turned over to the FBI or
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:48.280]  reported to the FBI?
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:50.280]  Let's remember, we interviewed
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:52.280]  three students the first two days
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:54.280]  and had local newscast where people
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.280]  be filming the news doing interviews
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:58.280]  on their iPhones or Droids
[01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:00.280]  or their smartphones
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:02.280]  but it would never go on the news
[01:56:02.280 --> 01:56:04.280]  but we had all these clips that were online
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:06.280]  of people saying there were multiple shooters
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:08.280]  there was a stand-down
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.280]  I came out and there were 10 police cars
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:12.280]  they were all sitting there while the shooting was going on
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:14.280]  I walked out with
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:16.280]  the guy they say was the shooter, he didn't have a gun
[01:56:16.280 --> 01:56:18.280]  and guns were still going off. I don't know
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:20.280]  what happened. They spun that
[01:56:20.280 --> 01:56:22.280]  that I said no one died and they were
[01:56:22.280 --> 01:56:24.280]  crisis actors. There is no video of that
[01:56:24.280 --> 01:56:26.280]  I didn't say that.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:28.280]  You didn't say that? I didn't say that, none of us
[01:56:28.280 --> 01:56:30.280]  said that. We said there was a stand-down
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:32.280]  which turned out to be true, Roger
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:34.280]  Well, we also reported
[01:56:34.280 --> 01:56:36.280]  that for some odd reason the Secret Service
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:38.280]  visited this high school
[01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:40.280]  pardon me, the FBI visited
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:42.280]  this high school weeks before
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:44.280]  under what regimen do
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:46.280]  the FBI
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:48.280]  go inspect local high schools?
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:50.280]  All we did was ask
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:52.280]  questions and
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:54.280]  by appointing
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:56.280]  a blue ribbon commission
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:58.280]  under the Florida Department of Law Enforcement
[01:56:58.280 --> 01:57:00.280]  Rick Scott has essentially
[01:57:00.280 --> 01:57:02.280]  stopped any public comment
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:04.280]  about Parkland as everyone waits
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:06.280]  the results of that report.
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:08.280]  Stay there, stay there. I'm going to go to Eagle Eye
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:10.280]  and I'm going to go to Kevin and Matt and
[01:57:10.280 --> 01:57:12.280]  everybody else like Vox and those who have been holding
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:14.280]  longest, right after you leave, but five more minutes
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:16.280]  Trump is saying this is hurting the red wave
[01:57:16.280 --> 01:57:18.280]  I agree. Is Trump wrong to come out?
[01:57:18.280 --> 01:57:20.280]  I mean I think he's right to come out and say oh yes
[01:57:20.280 --> 01:57:22.280]  terrible, whoever did this but he should also add
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:24.280]  thank God they were fake bombs, it wasn't like
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:26.280]  Scalise got shot by a real bullet
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.280]  but I think he thinks oh they'll get
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:30.280]  political points for that. No, they're all blaming
[01:57:30.280 --> 01:57:32.280]  him and me and you everywhere
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.280]  so when we come back in two minutes you said you
[01:57:34.280 --> 01:57:36.280]  saw MSNBC blaming me. I've got stacks
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:38.280]  of articles here saying I'm to blame
[01:57:38.280 --> 01:57:40.280]  and it's just incredible. We'll be back
[01:57:40.280 --> 01:57:42.280]  third hour, your calls, Roger Stone
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:44.280]  Matt Bracken and more, whatever you do
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:46.280]  share those live links.
[01:57:46.280 --> 01:57:48.280]  We've taken thousands
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:50.280]  of years of known research and put it together
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:52.280]  with our own four years of
[01:57:52.280 --> 01:57:54.280]  seeking and testing to find the very
[01:57:54.280 --> 01:57:56.280]  best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.280]  to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.280]  Z Shield. Toxic
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:02.280]  metal and chemical defense
[01:58:02.280 --> 01:58:04.280]  support. It's made in the USA
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:06.280]  it's filled with known compounds
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:08.280]  from nature that are absolutely associated
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:10.280]  with detoxifying the body and it supports
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:12.280]  the info war. It is a classical
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:14.280]  360 win. This is the formula
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:16.280]  that I personally have been taking for over
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:18.280]  a year and now we believe we have come
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:20.280]  as close to perfection when it comes
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:22.280]  to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.280]  get. You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family
[01:58:24.280 --> 01:58:26.280]  and you owe it to the future
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:28.280]  of this country and the world that patriots
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:30.280]  stay as healthy and as clean
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:32.280]  and as focused as you can be

[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:36.280]  of America, to reignite those brush
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.280]  fires the next level and to be healthy
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:40.280]  and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support
[01:58:40.280 --> 01:58:42.280]  and your prayers together we're changing

[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:38.280]  scared they were of all those live videos
[01:59:38.280 --> 01:59:40.280]  of 90% of the Trump supporters
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:42.280]  being huge info war supporters
[01:59:42.280 --> 01:59:44.280]  it scared them to death that's why they want

[01:59:50.280 --> 01:59:52.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:59:52.280 --> 01:59:54.280]  show.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:00.280]  The Alex Jones show
[02:00:00.280 --> 02:00:02.280]  because there is a war on
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:16.280]  for your mind.
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:18.280]  Well Broward County
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:20.280]  a lot of busy beavers down there
[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:22.280]  politically that's where Roger Stones live
[02:00:22.280 --> 02:00:24.280]  for many years in between New York

[02:00:28.280 --> 02:00:30.280]  and there was a police stand down
[02:00:30.280 --> 02:00:32.280]  ordered by the sheriff
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:34.280]  who now busted this guy that works
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:36.280]  for the travel government of the casinos
[02:00:36.280 --> 02:00:38.280]  Caesar Altair Sayok
[02:00:38.280 --> 02:00:40.280]  and Roger was
[02:00:40.280 --> 02:00:42.280]  held over to get into what he thinks Trump should say
[02:00:42.280 --> 02:00:44.280]  and do but he just dropped a bombshell
[02:00:44.280 --> 02:00:46.280]  Roger repeat for
[02:00:46.280 --> 02:00:48.280]  listeners what you just told me that's hiding
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:50.280]  in plain view. Has anybody
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:52.280]  heard about this guy in Trump
[02:00:52.280 --> 02:00:54.280]  in politics in your area?
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:56.280]  No I mean I have
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:58.280]  reached out through my network I've spoken
[02:00:58.280 --> 02:01:00.280]  to many many of the local grassroots
[02:01:00.280 --> 02:01:02.280]  Trump's groups in South Florida
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:04.280]  including in Miami
[02:01:04.280 --> 02:01:06.280]  many friends in the Proud Boys
[02:01:06.280 --> 02:01:08.280]  many friends in the Americans for
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:10.280]  Trump we had a great rally
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:12.280]  in Pompano Beach night before last
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:14.280]  we had a great rally at the
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.280]  Palm Beach Kennel Club a month
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:18.280]  ago none of the people
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:20.280]  that I'm networked to know
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:22.280]  this individual we haven't been able
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:24.280]  to find anyone who knows him
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:26.280]  I find that odd
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:28.280]  if I were the president frankly I would
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:30.280]  have FBI Director Ray
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:32.280]  in my office right now and say well
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:34.280]  Mr. Ray what do you know
[02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:36.280]  who arrested him how do we learn
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.280]  about him what do we really
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:40.280]  got on him where did it come from
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.280]  I think the president is in a position
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:44.280]  to get a better command of the facts
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:46.280]  than anyone and despite the fact
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:48.280]  that his FBI director is
[02:01:48.280 --> 02:01:50.280]  a deep stator who would look more
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.280]  comfortable behind the
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:54.280]  as a croupier in
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:56.280]  Atlantic City you know he had to
[02:01:56.280 --> 02:01:58.280]  get some hard answers
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:00.280]  the FBI director who when he learned
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:02.280]  about leaking by the FBI
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:04.280]  and their misuse
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:06.280]  by Obama said well we're going to have
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:08.280]  sensitivity training to solve that problem
[02:02:08.280 --> 02:02:10.280]  that guy
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:14.280]  that's big news that you're like
[02:02:14.280 --> 02:02:16.280]  one of the big kingpins of Republican
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:18.280]  politics in the state particularly in that
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:20.280]  county and no one has ever heard
[02:02:20.280 --> 02:02:22.280]  or seen of this guy
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:24.280]  and then he's got a twitter account that loves
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:26.280]  Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:28.280]  and Barack Obama this whole
[02:02:28.280 --> 02:02:30.280]  thing smells bad like you said
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:32.280]  this whole Trump mobile
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:34.280]  Colbert saying oh it's the Magabomber
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:36.280]  and magically it is I mean this
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:38.280]  thing is so synthetic Roger
[02:02:38.280 --> 02:02:40.280]  it does appear to be
[02:02:40.280 --> 02:02:42.280]  contrived I think it's important
[02:02:42.280 --> 02:02:44.280]  to note that here in Florida
[02:02:44.280 --> 02:02:46.280]  there's a real dichotomy
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:48.280]  between the Trump movement
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:50.280]  grassroots imagers
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:52.280]  well meaning patriots people who are brought
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:54.280]  to the process to save their country
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:56.280]  because they couldn't stand what
[02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:58.280]  was happening and they saw
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:00.280]  in Trump somebody with the guts to change things
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:02.280]  and the local Republican
[02:03:02.280 --> 02:03:04.280]  structure deeply
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:06.280]  committed to either Jeb Bush
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:08.280]  and now Marco Rubio
[02:03:08.280 --> 02:03:10.280]  who largely went through the motions
[02:03:10.280 --> 02:03:12.280]  of pretending to be for candidate
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:14.280]  Trump but sat on their hands
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:16.280]  the Trump
[02:03:16.280 --> 02:03:18.280]  community is big and it is vibrant
[02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:20.280]  and it is active and it's very
[02:03:20.280 --> 02:03:22.280]  net based
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:24.280]  and they're very communicative and they
[02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.280]  turn out in huge numbers
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:28.280]  none of those people so far
[02:03:28.280 --> 02:03:30.280]  that I have been able to network to
[02:03:30.280 --> 02:03:32.280]  have heard of this individual
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:36.280]  well that's another giant indicator
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:38.280]  Roger Stone we got a minute left
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.280]  anything else you think you should add
[02:03:42.280 --> 02:03:44.280]  what this shows me is that
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:46.280]  the polls the Democrats are looking at
[02:03:46.280 --> 02:03:48.280]  must have shown that this was
[02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:50.280]  moving post Kavanaugh
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.280]  and after the spasms
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.280]  of violence that have
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:56.280]  been
[02:03:56.280 --> 02:03:58.280]  promulgated by the Democratic party
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:00.280]  away from them
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:02.280]  Andrew Cuomo
[02:04:02.280 --> 02:04:04.280]  they're thug bully Prashona
[02:04:04.280 --> 02:04:06.280]  is hurting them so magically now we're
[02:04:06.280 --> 02:04:08.280]  the bad guys
[02:04:08.280 --> 02:04:10.280]  Andrew Cuomo calling for the New York Police Department
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:12.280]  to investigate the proud boys
[02:04:12.280 --> 02:04:14.280]  when video shows that it was in
[02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:16.280]  Tifa who threw the first bottles
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:18.280]  and drew first blood I think
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:20.280]  people see through that is raw
[02:04:20.280 --> 02:04:22.280]  political chicanery
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:24.280]  and you know
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:26.280]  that is not
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:28.280]  working for them
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:30.280]  so now they bring this forward 20 seconds
[02:04:30.280 --> 02:04:32.280]  do you agree though that if this
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:34.280]  problem goes well they may activate the
[02:04:34.280 --> 02:04:36.280]  real false flag
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.280]  look I think they are capable
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:40.280]  of any potential act of
[02:04:40.280 --> 02:04:42.280]  violence they have done it before
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:44.280]  they have done it
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:46.280]  again the deep state
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.280]  realizes that Donald Trump
[02:04:48.280 --> 02:04:50.280]  is a threat to their
[02:04:50.280 --> 02:04:52.280]  that's right they want to stop him now
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:04:54.280]  great poise Roger we'll talk to you more during the war room today

[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:28.280]  who are running all these criminal activities
[02:06:28.280 --> 02:06:30.280]  get mailed fake pipe bombs

[02:06:36.280 --> 02:06:38.280]  not even a smoke bomb
[02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:40.280]  these fake bombs we made as a joke
[02:06:40.280 --> 02:06:42.280]  that are road flares
[02:06:42.280 --> 02:06:44.280]  could actually burn something up if you let them
[02:06:44.280 --> 02:06:46.280]  so that these are more dangerous than
[02:06:46.280 --> 02:06:48.280]  potentially has no danger
[02:06:48.280 --> 02:06:50.280]  that now 12 people have been mailed
[02:06:50.280 --> 02:06:52.280]  so they can all be victims of the news
[02:06:52.280 --> 02:06:54.280]  simply insane
[02:06:54.280 --> 02:06:56.280]  to see all of this
[02:06:56.280 --> 02:06:58.280]  unfolding and now this individual
[02:06:58.280 --> 02:07:00.280]  works for the Seminole Nation the casinos
[02:07:00.280 --> 02:07:02.280]  that are 100% Democrat

[02:07:04.280 --> 02:07:06.280]  you've got the sheriff Israel
[02:07:06.280 --> 02:07:08.280]  of Coward County that ordered
[02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:10.280]  the stand down
[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:12.280]  during the
[02:07:12.280 --> 02:07:14.280]  Valentine's Day massacre
[02:07:14.280 --> 02:07:16.280]  in Parkland
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:18.280]  where this guy gets picked up somewhere
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:20.280]  the media gets called to then see the van
[02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:22.280]  and then to have the OJ Simpson right in
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:24.280]  hysteria on the back of the
[02:07:24.280 --> 02:07:26.280]  wrecker
[02:07:26.280 --> 02:07:28.280]  you've got the timing, you've got the emo
[02:07:28.280 --> 02:07:30.280]  you've got it all this is just insane
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:32.280]  we'll be talking to Matt Bracken here in a few minutes
[02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:34.280]  I'm going through
[02:07:34.280 --> 02:07:36.280]  law enforcement, military, EOD people
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:38.280]  you've been making a lot of great points
[02:07:38.280 --> 02:07:40.280]  I'll take a few of your calls and go to Bracken
[02:07:40.280 --> 02:07:42.280]  and continue with calls with Bracken
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:44.280]  here in just a moment
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:46.280]  the longest holding so far would be Kevin and then Vox
[02:07:46.280 --> 02:07:48.280]  Kevin in New Hampshire
[02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:50.280]  a Marine or former Marine on the topic
[02:07:50.280 --> 02:07:52.280]  what's your view on this
[02:07:52.280 --> 02:07:54.280]  well my first point to make Alex
[02:07:54.280 --> 02:07:56.280]  is my question to you
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:58.280]  the left in the media is how stupid do you think we are
[02:07:58.280 --> 02:08:00.280]  all the timing of all this
[02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:02.280]  the very first story that
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:04.280]  I saw as far as
[02:08:04.280 --> 02:08:06.280]  all these bomb threats was
[02:08:06.280 --> 02:08:08.280]  the one about George Soros
[02:08:08.280 --> 02:08:10.280]  that is so long it's like okay
[02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:12.280]  now I call bullshit
[02:08:12.280 --> 02:08:14.280]  sorry I only swear on your
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:16.280]  station but
[02:08:16.280 --> 02:08:18.280]  I call BS right there
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:20.280]  because George Soros has a
[02:08:20.280 --> 02:08:22.280]  pattern of behavior behind all of this
[02:08:22.280 --> 02:08:24.280]  I mean it was you guys that leaked the
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:26.280]  documents that they staged the Baltimore riots
[02:08:26.280 --> 02:08:28.280]  this man has
[02:08:28.280 --> 02:08:30.280]  short sold the pound back in
[02:08:30.280 --> 02:08:32.280]  92 and both is about it
[02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:34.280]  saying I know I'm taking money out of the
[02:08:34.280 --> 02:08:36.280]  British taxpayers pockets
[02:08:36.280 --> 02:08:38.280]  but if I think about that how I make a profit
[02:08:38.280 --> 02:08:40.280]  this guy is not the collaborator
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:42.280]  he was behind
[02:08:42.280 --> 02:08:44.280]  the Arab springer volts he was behind Ukraine
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:46.280]  it's a pattern
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:48.280]  and he brags he's involved
[02:08:48.280 --> 02:08:50.280]  and by the way I don't listen
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:52.280]  to it but families all told me and
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:54.280]  every local news show
[02:08:54.280 --> 02:08:56.280]  has been paid to read PR
[02:08:56.280 --> 02:08:58.280]  every day that he fought the Nazis
[02:08:58.280 --> 02:09:00.280]  and he was a victim of Nazis then I am
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:02.280]  defiling a holocaust survivor
[02:09:02.280 --> 02:09:04.280]  and then it's on the national news so he's
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:06.280]  paying everyone
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:08.280]  to talk about now that he was a victim
[02:09:08.280 --> 02:09:10.280]  of the Nazis it just shows
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:12.280]  how damn powerful this guy is
[02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:14.280]  I believe my point and
[02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:16.280]  I even tell people that well of course
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:18.280]  all the narratives are going to type that up because
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:20.280]  the guy owns media matters for America
[02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.280]  they oversee all of our media of course
[02:09:22.280 --> 02:09:24.280]  he's going to control the narrative
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:26.280]  but you know you can lead a horse to water
[02:09:26.280 --> 02:09:28.280]  you can't make him drink it's just
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:30.280]  ridiculous what do you think their next move is
[02:09:30.280 --> 02:09:32.280]  this is clearly synthetic what is their
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:34.280]  next move because I think
[02:09:34.280 --> 02:09:36.280]  we all apologize and oh my god we're so sorry
[02:09:36.280 --> 02:09:38.280]  what about Scalise what about Rand Paul
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:40.280]  what about anti-violence what about all the dead cops
[02:09:40.280 --> 02:09:42.280]  we should be okay sad some fake pipe bombs
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:44.280]  got mailed this is very suspicious we're not
[02:09:44.280 --> 02:09:46.280]  calling for violence the media keeps saying
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:48.280]  we're calling for it something is stinking
[02:09:48.280 --> 02:09:50.280]  here I think Trump's made a mistake
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:52.280]  here being not not I'm glad
[02:09:52.280 --> 02:09:54.280]  he's saying we've caught the guy whatever but he should be saying it's
[02:09:54.280 --> 02:09:56.280]  suspicious like he did about the
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:58.280]  Jewish center attacks because
[02:09:58.280 --> 02:10:00.280]  he's walking into them staging something bigger I think
[02:10:00.280 --> 02:10:02.280]  absolutely
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:04.280]  absolutely I'm a good way to keep
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:06.280]  up to date on all these attacks
[02:10:06.280 --> 02:10:08.280]  of a page and website I found
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:10.280]  how they got right wing
[02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:12.280]  watch out there well far left
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:14.280]  watch has just popped up and you can see
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:16.280]  the violence just every
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:18.280]  day coming out of no I agree we should
[02:10:18.280 --> 02:10:20.280]  be following left wing watch every day with
[02:10:20.280 --> 02:10:22.280]  it with a little report that shows all
[02:10:22.280 --> 02:10:24.280]  their incredible violence God bless you thank you Kevin
[02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:26.280]  we're going to go to Vox
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:28.280]  and we're going to go to everybody else's
[02:10:28.280 --> 02:10:30.280]  patiently holding interspersed with Matt Bracken
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:32.280]  but the FBI detains
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:34.280]  Melbourne suspects he's a white van
[02:10:34.280 --> 02:10:36.280]  with pro Trump posters
[02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:38.280]  they're going to hold a press conference coming up
[02:10:38.280 --> 02:10:40.280]  very soon that we'll be
[02:10:40.280 --> 02:10:42.280]  carrying some of so stay with us everybody
[02:10:42.280 --> 02:10:44.280]  that's set for about 15 minutes from now
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:46.280]  I'm sure it's
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:48.280]  remember the FBI and the Justice Department at the top
[02:10:48.280 --> 02:10:50.280]  is a bunch of Clinton and globalist
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:52.280]  operatives that's why this country
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:54.280]  is in so much trouble we'll see what happens
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:56.280]  Matt Bracken we called this we predicted this
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:58.280]  and you've been on top of it
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:00.280]  you know Monday saying it's fake bombs that was
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:02.280]  confirmed the next day
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:04.280]  or you
[02:11:04.280 --> 02:11:06.280]  said the day it happened I guess that was Wednesday you said it was fake
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:08.280]  and then
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:10.280]  the next day it was confirmed what are you seeing
[02:11:10.280 --> 02:11:12.280]  now with this whole situation and then this individual
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:16.280]  it's another twist
[02:11:16.280 --> 02:11:18.280]  that it's Scott Israel
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:20.280]  and Broward County that's got the guy
[02:11:20.280 --> 02:11:22.280]  in custody so
[02:11:22.280 --> 02:11:24.280]  it'll be interesting to see what kind of lawyers are
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:26.280]  in there talking to him
[02:11:26.280 --> 02:11:28.280]  if there's an arraignment I expect him to come out
[02:11:28.280 --> 02:11:30.280]  if he could
[02:11:30.280 --> 02:11:32.280]  he'd be wearing a MAGA hat
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:34.280]  and he'll be yelling I love Trump
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:36.280]  to go along with all the stickers on the windows of his van
[02:11:36.280 --> 02:11:38.280]  which all appear to have been
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.280]  put on recently if you actually had
[02:11:40.280 --> 02:11:42.280]  those stickers on your van Broward County
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:44.280]  you know for the last couple months
[02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:46.280]  your car your van would have been torched
[02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:48.280]  I mean keyed torched spray painted
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:50.280]  so this is this is part of
[02:11:50.280 --> 02:11:52.280]  the setup
[02:11:52.280 --> 02:11:54.280]  and it's where congressman
[02:11:54.280 --> 02:11:56.280]  he's the leader of the anti
[02:11:56.280 --> 02:11:58.280]  free speech movement
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:00.280]  even worse than Pelosi
[02:12:00.280 --> 02:12:02.280]  yeah this is
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:04.280]  those window stickers
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.280]  were obviously put on
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:08.280]  to be shown today
[02:12:08.280 --> 02:12:10.280]  to go along with the narrative
[02:12:10.280 --> 02:12:12.280]  and I expected an arraignment
[02:12:12.280 --> 02:12:14.280]  he's going to yell I love Trump
[02:12:14.280 --> 02:12:16.280]  you know how Trump Trump forever
[02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:18.280]  it's all part of it
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.280]  and if you go back
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:22.280]  in his social media I heard
[02:12:22.280 --> 02:12:24.280]  on the radio that his
[02:12:24.280 --> 02:12:26.280]  Twitter only goes back to 2016
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:28.280]  which is when Trump was elected
[02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:30.280]  and I have knowledge of infiltration
[02:12:30.280 --> 02:12:32.280]  of the right into the left
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:34.280]  and the left into the right
[02:12:34.280 --> 02:12:36.280]  by people scrubbing their social media
[02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:38.280]  and then waiting and then coming back as the opposite
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:40.280]  so that they can either
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:42.280]  infiltrate redneck revolt
[02:12:42.280 --> 02:12:44.280]  or redneck revolt infiltrate the
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:46.280]  proud boys for example
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:48.280]  because both sides are trying to get people
[02:12:48.280 --> 02:12:50.280]  inside of the other camp
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:52.280]  in order to spy on them
[02:12:52.280 --> 02:12:54.280]  to get on the
[02:12:54.280 --> 02:12:56.280]  distribution list
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:12:58.280]  so it doesn't take a big stress of the imagination
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:00.280]  to see a guy not knowing exactly
[02:13:00.280 --> 02:13:02.280]  what his usefulness would be
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:04.280]  but going on and creating
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:06.280]  a false social media persona
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:08.280]  as a uber conservative
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:10.280]  so that when the time was right
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:12.280]  he could pop out as a Trump supporter
[02:13:12.280 --> 02:13:14.280]  doing something crazy
[02:13:14.280 --> 02:13:16.280]  and people commit suicide
[02:13:16.280 --> 02:13:18.280]  for their political views
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:20.280]  if he's willing to take one for the team
[02:13:20.280 --> 02:13:22.280]  he mails it, he knows he's going to get caught
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:24.280]  he does this all without even being directed
[02:13:24.280 --> 02:13:26.280]  the problem is all the pre-programming
[02:13:26.280 --> 02:13:28.280]  that this was coming by media shows me that
[02:13:28.280 --> 02:13:30.280]  he was being directed
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:32.280]  it's very possible he was being directed
[02:13:32.280 --> 02:13:34.280]  but on what level
[02:13:34.280 --> 02:13:36.280]  it remains to be seen
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.280]  he might think that he's scrubbed his social media
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.280]  but there might be ways to go in
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:42.280]  and find old social media
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:44.280]  whether or not that will be coming in
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:46.280]  I agree, why do you think now he's got three different aliases
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:48.280]  I mean it's him in videos on Facebook
[02:13:48.280 --> 02:13:50.280]  it's him on Twitter
[02:13:50.280 --> 02:13:52.280]  he's like a liberal, he's a conservative
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:54.280]  but it's him
[02:13:54.280 --> 02:13:56.280]  he just looks like some operative
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:58.280]  who would be playing both sides
[02:13:58.280 --> 02:14:00.280]  somebody that's doing this has a false flag
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:02.280]  I mean the van is
[02:14:02.280 --> 02:14:04.280]  so over the top
[02:14:04.280 --> 02:14:06.280]  the last thing that a guy is going to do
[02:14:06.280 --> 02:14:08.280]  is make a van that looks like that
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:10.280]  while he's dropping off pipe bombs
[02:14:10.280 --> 02:14:12.280]  supposed pipe bombs
[02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:14.280]  it's completely bogus
[02:14:14.280 --> 02:14:16.280]  that MSNBC is blaming me for this
[02:14:16.280 --> 02:14:18.280]  and they are saying that this guy tweeted info wars
[02:14:20.280 --> 02:14:22.280]  are there any info wars stickers on that van
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:24.280]  it seems unlikely that he'd missed that
[02:14:24.280 --> 02:14:26.280]  but maybe he only
[02:14:26.280 --> 02:14:28.280]  asked for all the Republican stickers he could find
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:30.280]  of course if you sign up
[02:14:30.280 --> 02:14:32.280]  get on their donation list
[02:14:32.280 --> 02:14:34.280]  they'll send you all the stickers you want
[02:14:34.280 --> 02:14:36.280]  some of them might not even be stickers
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:38.280]  he might have actually taped some
[02:14:38.280 --> 02:14:40.280]  well let me tell you
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:42.280]  it's a wrap
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:44.280]  somebody made a big photo shop
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.280]  follow that
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:48.280]  and that was professionally wrapped
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:52.280]  okay yeah
[02:14:52.280 --> 02:14:54.280]  see that's not stickers right
[02:14:54.280 --> 02:14:56.280]  and that's amazing so it's part of the
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:14:58.280]  Trump on a tank
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:00.280]  it's so bogus I think that people are going to see it as a false flag
[02:15:00.280 --> 02:15:02.280]  and cross hairs on the Democrats to make them heroes
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:06.280]  right it's so obviously over the top
[02:15:06.280 --> 02:15:08.280]  if he was a little bit more subtle
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:10.280]  it would probably work better
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:12.280]  you know it's hard to get somebody like
[02:15:12.280 --> 02:15:14.280]  this to know to be able to
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.280]  regulate you know the subtlety
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:18.280]  or irony level but it's I'm expecting
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:20.280]  next in the surveillance videos
[02:15:20.280 --> 02:15:22.280]  where he's dropping off the packages
[02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:24.280]  they'll be wearing a MAGA hat and a MAGA shirt
[02:15:24.280 --> 02:15:26.280]  you know I think
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:28.280]  that that's what we'll see next
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:30.280]  and I think it won't work I think it just adds
[02:15:30.280 --> 02:15:32.280]  to the false flag narrative
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:34.280]  you're not on CNN they'll play it straight
[02:15:34.280 --> 02:15:36.280]  but normal Americans are hip to false flags
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:38.280]  Trump's worried it could
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:40.280]  it could hurt the red wave we're going to come back
[02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:42.280]  and take calls from Vox
[02:15:42.280 --> 02:15:44.280]  and we're going to take calls from
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:46.280]  Eagle Eye
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:48.280]  and Jack and Aaron and Matt
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:50.280]  and Garrett and everybody else
[02:15:50.280 --> 02:15:52.280]  stay with us newswars.com

[02:16:54.280 --> 02:16:56.280]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla
[02:16:56.280 --> 02:16:58.280]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:00.280]  when they tried to seize my mother's house
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:02.280]  I sued the IRS in one
[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:04.280]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:06.280]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:08.280]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[02:17:08.280 --> 02:17:10.280]  they thought might never be solved
[02:17:10.280 --> 02:17:12.280]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes

[02:17:58.280 --> 02:18:00.280]  that we're all getting punch drunk to the censorship
[02:18:00.280 --> 02:18:02.280]  and you saw 18 Twitter accounts
[02:18:02.280 --> 02:18:04.280]  they say affiliated with InfoWars
[02:18:04.280 --> 02:18:06.280]  yes some of them are like little side accounts
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:08.280]  they even know we had like InfoWars stores
[02:18:08.280 --> 02:18:10.280]  that just showed our products but they just banned them all
[02:18:10.280 --> 02:18:12.280]  yesterday in punishment
[02:18:12.280 --> 02:18:14.280]  that I be at a Trump rally and be mobbed
[02:18:14.280 --> 02:18:16.280]  by all these folks that loved us
[02:18:16.280 --> 02:18:18.280]  your excitement about America
[02:18:18.280 --> 02:18:20.280]  your excitement about this broadcast is what brought the country
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:22.280]  and the world back from the brink
[02:18:22.280 --> 02:18:24.280]  but the globalists now want to target
[02:18:24.280 --> 02:18:26.280]  where the resistance came from
[02:18:26.280 --> 02:18:28.280]  so that we're not pesky in the future
[02:18:28.280 --> 02:18:30.280]  I want to be troublesome
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:32.280]  and pesky, I want to keep going
[02:18:32.280 --> 02:18:34.280]  I want to make them do the ultimate
[02:18:34.280 --> 02:18:36.280]  not just destroy us financially
[02:18:36.280 --> 02:18:38.280]  I want to push all the way
[02:18:38.280 --> 02:18:40.280]  I've committed to do that, I've prayed for that
[02:18:40.280 --> 02:18:42.280]  and I've been told that's going to happen
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:44.280]  and I promise you this
[02:18:44.280 --> 02:18:46.280]  I will never falter
[02:18:46.280 --> 02:18:48.280]  I will never waver at the spiritual level
[02:18:48.280 --> 02:18:50.280]  I physically will but I give you my commitment
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:52.280]  if you financially support us
[02:18:52.280 --> 02:18:54.280]  then go to foreshore.com to give you my absolute
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:18:56.280]  total commitment
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:58.280]  it's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:00.280]  to still get to the gym
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:02.280]  or to go for a run or go to the park
[02:19:02.280 --> 02:19:04.280]  or heck even take your dog for a walk
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:06.280]  believe me, I know
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:08.280]  I spend hours in front of a screen
[02:19:08.280 --> 02:19:10.280]  and then hours in front of bright lights
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:12.280]  but thanks to supermailvitality

[02:19:16.280 --> 02:19:18.280]  there's no way I could have the energy
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:20.280]  at the end of a long day
[02:19:20.280 --> 02:19:22.280]  to fight back against the chemicals and the food and water
[02:19:22.280 --> 02:19:24.280]  to fight back against the modern day lifestyle
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:26.280]  with the screen time and the extended hours
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:28.280]  to still have the stamina
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:30.280]  and endurance, energy and drive
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:32.280]  to get to the gym, get to the park
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:34.280]  and get exercise that you need
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:36.280]  for your health
[02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:38.280]  so go to infowarstore.com

[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:46.280]  of supermailvitality

[02:20:20.280 --> 02:20:22.280]  here's an announcement
[02:20:22.280 --> 02:20:24.280]  War Room
[02:20:24.280 --> 02:20:26.280]  3-6 is going to be covering this
[02:20:26.280 --> 02:20:28.280]  tonight 8-10 we'll do live election coverage
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:30.280]  we'll have the latest infowarstore.com
[02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:32.280]  some of our radio and TV stations
[02:20:32.280 --> 02:20:34.280]  do cover our live election coverage
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:36.280]  breaking news coverage that goes right through the election
[02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:38.280]  and for about a week after
[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:40.280]  we're going to launch a new show
[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:42.280]  7-10 Central Weeknights
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:44.280]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL
[02:20:44.280 --> 02:20:46.280]  Ordon Sexford, best-selling authors
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:48.280]  riding shotgun for this segment
[02:20:48.280 --> 02:20:50.280]  we've got a press conference from the FBI
[02:20:50.280 --> 02:20:52.280]  supposedly coming up in about 10 minutes
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:54.280]  we'll see what they have to say
[02:20:54.280 --> 02:20:56.280]  if there's anything new there
[02:20:56.280 --> 02:20:58.280]  we'll cover some of that
[02:20:58.280 --> 02:21:00.280]  we're taking calls from former Ordon's experts
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:02.280]  or current Ordon's experts
[02:21:02.280 --> 02:21:04.280]  people that work for the military and the police
[02:21:04.280 --> 02:21:06.280]  they've all been making really great points
[02:21:06.280 --> 02:21:08.280]  and Unison aren't buying what's happening
[02:21:08.280 --> 02:21:10.280]  but I'll say this
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.280]  we're getting a bunch of calls saying
[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:14.280]  hey we live in Florida
[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:16.280]  and you can't have thick tent on vans or anything
[02:21:16.280 --> 02:21:18.280]  which I know Florida has even stronger laws than Texas
[02:21:18.280 --> 02:21:20.280]  and no folks have had problems
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:22.280]  from Texas there with darker tent
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:24.280]  this guy had all the windows
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:26.280]  except the windshield covered
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:28.280]  in perfect wraps
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:30.280]  that fit exactly into it
[02:21:30.280 --> 02:21:32.280]  except for the
[02:21:32.280 --> 02:21:34.280]  two front windows, side windows
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:36.280]  and the windshield
[02:21:36.280 --> 02:21:38.280]  and again some of these are perfect wraps
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:40.280]  this whole thing
[02:21:40.280 --> 02:21:42.280]  just looks ridiculous
[02:21:42.280 --> 02:21:44.280]  so you get your car vandalized
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:46.280]  any of this
[02:21:46.280 --> 02:21:48.280]  it's just the whole thing looks synthetic
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:50.280]  man I want to go
[02:21:50.280 --> 02:21:52.280]  to Vox under callers and you're taking what they have to say
[02:21:52.280 --> 02:21:54.280]  but
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:56.280]  we're 11 days out
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:58.280]  we knew this was coming the media hyping that we were going to cause
[02:21:58.280 --> 02:22:00.280]  violence against them
[02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:02.280]  their number one story for six months was so obvious
[02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:04.280]  that they were pre-programming
[02:22:04.280 --> 02:22:06.280]  and I'm really concerned that they're just beta testing
[02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:08.280]  with this and if we buy this
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:10.280]  and if this looks successful they're going to pull a real false flag
[02:22:10.280 --> 02:22:12.280]  not one with fake bombs
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:14.280]  there's no way this is
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:16.280]  having the intended effect
[02:22:16.280 --> 02:22:18.280]  my wife, I already voted by mail
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:20.280]  my wife voted today
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:22.280]  and it's the same story
[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:24.280]  they're talking about on local radio
[02:22:24.280 --> 02:22:26.280]  she had to wait more than an hour
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:28.280]  where normally you walk in for a midterm election
[02:22:28.280 --> 02:22:30.280]  you're in and out in a minute
[02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:32.280]  and people are saying they haven't seen anything like this
[02:22:32.280 --> 02:22:34.280]  in 30 years including
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:36.280]  2016 presidential election
[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:38.280]  and it's all people that are pissed off
[02:22:38.280 --> 02:22:40.280]  that are Republicans
[02:22:40.280 --> 02:22:42.280]  so I think that this is
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:44.280]  so obvious
[02:22:44.280 --> 02:22:46.280]  those wraps in the windows, the guy didn't make that at home
[02:22:46.280 --> 02:22:48.280]  he had to go to a printer
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:50.280]  that has a large format machine
[02:22:50.280 --> 02:22:52.280]  he might have done the work on his computer
[02:22:52.280 --> 02:22:54.280]  but a printer had to create those
[02:22:54.280 --> 02:22:56.280]  and the FBI
[02:22:56.280 --> 02:22:58.280]  I'm sure knows who printed them
[02:22:58.280 --> 02:23:00.280]  and when
[02:23:00.280 --> 02:23:02.280]  if they were created in the last two weeks
[02:23:02.280 --> 02:23:04.280]  it's going to look pretty obvious
[02:23:04.280 --> 02:23:06.280]  that it was part of the entire hoax
[02:23:06.280 --> 02:23:08.280]  pipe bomb scheme
[02:23:08.280 --> 02:23:10.280]  not something organic
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:12.280]  that the guy's been putting on
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:14.280]  year over year
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:16.280]  we've all seen these campers and vans
[02:23:16.280 --> 02:23:18.280]  covered with stickers
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:20.280]  they're one on top of the other
[02:23:20.280 --> 02:23:22.280]  they're faded, they're peeling
[02:23:22.280 --> 02:23:24.280]  because they go on as the guy gets struck
[02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:26.280]  by a new bumper sticker to stick on top
[02:23:26.280 --> 02:23:28.280]  this is deliberate
[02:23:28.280 --> 02:23:30.280]  this was professionally printed
[02:23:30.280 --> 02:23:32.280]  but let's expand on that
[02:23:32.280 --> 02:23:34.280]  why would any Trump supporter
[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:36.280]  conservatives, libertarians, Christians
[02:23:36.280 --> 02:23:38.280]  and Republicans offensively
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:40.280]  that's not in the M.O. other than
[02:23:40.280 --> 02:23:42.280]  the fake Oklahoma City
[02:23:42.280 --> 02:23:44.280]  which again was Holder and the rest of them
[02:23:44.280 --> 02:23:46.280]  we know, why on earth
[02:23:46.280 --> 02:23:48.280]  would you when we're winning
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:50.280]  send this to Hillary and Bill
[02:23:50.280 --> 02:23:52.280]  and Obama and Holder
[02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:54.280]  and Soros and make them victims
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:23:56.280]  it's the worst thing you could do
[02:23:56.280 --> 02:23:58.280]  it's a false flag
[02:23:58.280 --> 02:24:00.280]  including the van
[02:24:00.280 --> 02:24:02.280]  I think that he intended to be caught
[02:24:02.280 --> 02:24:04.280]  part of the reason for his fake bombs
[02:24:04.280 --> 02:24:06.280]  having any gunpowder for example
[02:24:06.280 --> 02:24:08.280]  is so that in court, in trial
[02:24:08.280 --> 02:24:10.280]  he can claim he never had any intention
[02:24:10.280 --> 02:24:12.280]  or capability of harming anybody
[02:24:12.280 --> 02:24:14.280]  that it was just a stunt
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:16.280]  exactly and all he gets is six months in a lunatic asylum
[02:24:16.280 --> 02:24:18.280]  he did in Broward County
[02:24:18.280 --> 02:24:20.280]  where they have this whole thing, if you're quoted a minority
[02:24:20.280 --> 02:24:22.280]  you can command all these crimes and they let you go
[02:24:22.280 --> 02:24:24.280]  absolutely, that's the missing link
[02:24:24.280 --> 02:24:26.280]  the sheriff Israel
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:28.280]  of Coward County is in command
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:30.280]  right, but I'm sure that
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:32.280]  they're gonna, they'll know
[02:24:32.280 --> 02:24:34.280]  who is in and out in terms of lawyers
[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:36.280]  and if it's an ACLU
[02:24:36.280 --> 02:24:38.280]  lawyer or the firm
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:40.280]  that represented
[02:24:40.280 --> 02:24:42.280]  the Kavanaugh accusers
[02:24:42.280 --> 02:24:44.280]  we'll know the fix is in there
[02:24:44.280 --> 02:24:46.280]  but I think that the guy's gonna come out to the arraignment
[02:24:46.280 --> 02:24:48.280]  and he's gonna be shouting
[02:24:48.280 --> 02:24:50.280]  God bless Trump
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:52.280]  I love Trump, Trump forever
[02:24:52.280 --> 02:24:54.280]  it's all part of it for the next 12 days
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:56.280]  but I think it's gonna have the reverse effect
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:24:58.280]  the van is so obviously
[02:24:58.280 --> 02:25:00.280]  a bogus part of a false flag
[02:25:00.280 --> 02:25:02.280]  but yes, nobody I know
[02:25:02.280 --> 02:25:04.280]  buys that this whole thing's real
[02:25:04.280 --> 02:25:06.280]  and now this just gets more ridiculous
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:08.280]  so go to Vox in New York
[02:25:08.280 --> 02:25:10.280]  I'm here with Matt Bracken and Alex Jones
[02:25:10.280 --> 02:25:12.280]  you're an aerospace engineer on the bombings
[02:25:12.280 --> 02:25:14.280]  what do you think about not just the fake bombing
[02:25:14.280 --> 02:25:16.280]  and the fake bombs but now this
[02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:18.280]  well, the thing I wanted to point out
[02:25:18.280 --> 02:25:20.280]  about these fake bombs
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:22.280]  being a political event
[02:25:22.280 --> 02:25:24.280]  orchestrated for maximum political effect
[02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:26.280]  is that it took them over three days
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:28.280]  to definitively declare these things fake
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:30.280]  Alex, any competent
[02:25:30.280 --> 02:25:32.280]  intelligent agent
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:34.280]  or bomb experts would say no
[02:25:34.280 --> 02:25:36.280]  no way
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:38.280]  the LED thing, the dollar store
[02:25:38.280 --> 02:25:40.280]  LED device with a 1.5
[02:25:40.280 --> 02:25:42.280]  volt watch battery
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:44.280]  doesn't have the kind of outputs
[02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:46.280]  or even triggers
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:48.280]  or logic gates
[02:25:48.280 --> 02:25:50.280]  you didn't even do it
[02:25:50.280 --> 02:25:52.280]  so the fact that I have a difficult time accepting
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:54.280]  that it took them three days
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:56.280]  to tell us this
[02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.280]  means these guys are really dumb
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:00.280]  or they deliberately held this
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:02.280]  information for maximum political effect
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:04.280]  which latter I think
[02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.280]  is definitely the case
[02:26:06.280 --> 02:26:08.280]  to give the Don Lemons and the Wolf Blitz
[02:26:08.280 --> 02:26:10.280]  his times to milk it
[02:26:10.280 --> 02:26:12.280]  which is what they've been doing these last three days
[02:26:12.280 --> 02:26:14.280]  it's a sure
[02:26:14.280 --> 02:26:16.280]  it's a cheesy October surprise
[02:26:16.280 --> 02:26:18.280]  and if this is the best they got
[02:26:18.280 --> 02:26:20.280]  it's pretty bad actually
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:22.280]  now I agree it's a really cheesy October surprise
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:24.280]  and that's why
[02:26:24.280 --> 02:26:26.280]  I'm really concerned
[02:26:26.280 --> 02:26:28.280]  that this is a distraction from something bigger
[02:26:28.280 --> 02:26:30.280]  Matt like you said
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:32.280]  and I want to get Vox's take first
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:34.280]  an attack on that caravan
[02:26:34.280 --> 02:26:36.280]  that just like
[02:26:36.280 --> 02:26:38.280]  James Woods and you and I predicted
[02:26:38.280 --> 02:26:40.280]  they wouldn't be on foot they got trucks
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:42.280]  bringing them up right on time a few days
[02:26:42.280 --> 02:26:44.280]  before to claim some militia right winger
[02:26:44.280 --> 02:26:46.280]  shoots these folks what do you think Vox
[02:26:46.280 --> 02:26:48.280]  well I'll tell you what I do think
[02:26:48.280 --> 02:26:50.280]  that
[02:26:50.280 --> 02:26:52.280]  obviously it's staged that one too
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:54.280]  and it's the Saul Alinsky
[02:26:54.280 --> 02:26:56.280]  Jean Sharp technique
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:26:58.280]  of sort of roping your target
[02:26:58.280 --> 02:27:00.280]  being Trump into an untenable
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:02.280]  media position by having like pregnant women
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:04.280]  and children up front and then what
[02:27:04.280 --> 02:27:06.280]  the guards have to
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:08.280]  sort of like either physically restrain them
[02:27:08.280 --> 02:27:10.280]  or shoot them or something with rubber bullets or something
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:12.280]  so this is a way to
[02:27:12.280 --> 02:27:14.280]  sort of like an attempt
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:16.280]  it's not going to be a successful one
[02:27:16.280 --> 02:27:18.280]  but to sort of rope Trump in and this
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:20.280]  is Alinsky, Jean Sharp
[02:27:20.280 --> 02:27:22.280]  they've said no I agree Alinsky and you can't
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:24.280]  have borders no borders no wall no USA
[02:27:24.280 --> 02:27:26.280]  at all and the good news is Lou Dobbs
[02:27:26.280 --> 02:27:28.280]  James Woods it's not just Alex Jones now
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:30.280]  it's Rush Limbaugh all saying this is a false flag
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:32.280]  this is a stunt it's fake everyone agrees
[02:27:32.280 --> 02:27:34.280]  I think that's the real moment
[02:27:34.280 --> 02:27:36.280]  we've crossed here Vox
[02:27:36.280 --> 02:27:38.280]  is that now and I like to say
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:40.280]  I'm becoming an obsolete in a way
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:42.280]  and that's why they've said all the news
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:44.280]  the Republican Party has now been Alex
[02:27:44.280 --> 02:27:46.280]  Jones assized well no you just
[02:27:46.280 --> 02:27:48.280]  met reality it's not me people
[02:27:48.280 --> 02:27:50.280]  are now having common sense it's safer
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:52.280]  to say it now Vox great points thank you
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:54.280]  Matt comments on that
[02:27:54.280 --> 02:27:56.280]  the mainstream media is just catching up
[02:27:56.280 --> 02:27:58.280]  to where we've been for years
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:00.280]  there's no doubt
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.280]  that they're milking the fake
[02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:04.280]  pseudo bombs they're still carrying
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:06.280]  these things out in that
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:08.280]  containment truck blocking
[02:28:08.280 --> 02:28:10.280]  off New York City traffic like it's a
[02:28:10.280 --> 02:28:12.280]  plutonium device
[02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:14.280]  they evacuated the CNN
[02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:16.280]  building like it was a truck bomb
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:18.280]  the thing would if it even if it was
[02:28:18.280 --> 02:28:20.280]  full of gunpowder it wouldn't blow up
[02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:22.280]  a broom closet you know not if you held
[02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:24.280]  it in your hand it might
[02:28:24.280 --> 02:28:26.280]  have had a few
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:28.280]  of your fingers get scolded I mean
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:30.280]  it's just pure crap
[02:28:30.280 --> 02:28:32.280]  to evacuate buildings over it
[02:28:32.280 --> 02:28:34.280]  and then to have you know the helicopter
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:36.280]  views of you know six blocks
[02:28:36.280 --> 02:28:38.280]  of New York you know cordoned
[02:28:38.280 --> 02:28:40.280]  off with the prime tape and cop cars
[02:28:40.280 --> 02:28:42.280]  and Cuomo calling out the National Guard
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:44.280]  and breathlessly it's
[02:28:44.280 --> 02:28:46.280]  so obvious the breathless
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:48.280]  and the
[02:28:48.280 --> 02:28:50.280]  mayor of New York saying these are real these are dangerous
[02:28:50.280 --> 02:28:52.280]  these are scary they're real they're real

[02:32:26.280 --> 02:32:28.280]  I bought a huge amount of it
[02:32:28.280 --> 02:32:30.280]  ordered it six months ago
[02:32:30.280 --> 02:32:32.280]  so I get the price down and I said
[02:32:32.280 --> 02:32:34.280]  if you don't lower it I'm done I'm breaking the contract
[02:32:34.280 --> 02:32:36.280]  well I broke the contract last week
[02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.280]  and so this is potentially the last run
[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:40.280]  in fact right now it is the last run
[02:32:40.280 --> 02:32:42.280]  so there's viable shield x2
[02:32:42.280 --> 02:32:44.280]  and we've got a good supply of it
[02:32:44.280 --> 02:32:46.280]  it'll be gone in a couple months
[02:32:46.280 --> 02:32:48.280]  x2 if you haven't experienced it
[02:32:48.280 --> 02:32:50.280]  infowarsstore.com if you have experienced it
[02:32:50.280 --> 02:32:52.280]  I suggest you stock up on it
[02:32:52.280 --> 02:32:54.280]  it's available right now for a limited time
[02:32:54.280 --> 02:33:22.280]  infowars.com
[02:33:22.280 --> 02:33:24.280]  All right eagle eyes been a trooper
[02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:26.280]  and been holding
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:28.280]  but when you take 20 calls at times
[02:33:28.280 --> 02:33:30.280]  you kind of have to if you get in
[02:33:30.280 --> 02:33:32.280]  and then we're going to go to everybody else
[02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:34.280]  that's holding Matt Brackens here
[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:36.280]  we're going to have the
[02:33:36.280 --> 02:33:38.280]  press conference
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:40.280]  I really want to hear what Sheriff Israel says
[02:33:40.280 --> 02:33:42.280]  because that's a dangerous sneaky bad guy
[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:44.280]  Parkland happened
[02:33:44.280 --> 02:33:46.280]  but not the way they said it did
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:48.280]  and you know you got David Hogg
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:50.280]  in two videos saying he was at home when it happened
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:52.280]  and then he wrote an hour to it
[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:54.280]  and then he's in a closet saying it's happening now
[02:33:54.280 --> 02:33:56.280]  I mean you know just some
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:58.280]  weird stuff man and they don't want it
[02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:00.280]  questioned and now this
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:02.280]  they will have a you know
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:04.280]  an event like this that's all weird
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:06.280]  every month or so it will always be in his county
[02:34:06.280 --> 02:34:08.280]  but
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:10.280]  Carla Ray of an ABC affiliate
[02:34:10.280 --> 02:34:12.280]  WFTV reporting I just obtained
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:14.280]  the 2002 arrest epidemic related to
[02:34:14.280 --> 02:34:16.280]  Caesar
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:18.280]  Seiko
[02:34:18.280 --> 02:34:20.280]  making a bomb threat
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:22.280]  it states he called Florida power
[02:34:22.280 --> 02:34:24.280]  and light and said it would be worse than September 11
[02:34:24.280 --> 02:34:26.280]  and then he got the report up there
[02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:28.280]  and law enforcement says he was known to them in Florida
[02:34:28.280 --> 02:34:30.280]  and New York for making
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:32.280]  threats
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:34.280]  you know I mean if I call it and said
[02:34:34.280 --> 02:34:36.280]  if you turn my lights off it'll be worse than September 11
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:38.280]  I should be arrested that's a terrorist threat
[02:34:38.280 --> 02:34:40.280]  why are these people always allowed
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:42.280]  to do this people like death threat me and I've called the police
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:44.280]  they can't do anything they go oh grand jury
[02:34:44.280 --> 02:34:46.280]  won't indict them people saying I'm
[02:34:46.280 --> 02:34:48.280]  going to kill you
[02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:50.280]  well we don't think it's a credible threat
[02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:52.280]  okay fine whatever Matt Brackens
[02:34:52.280 --> 02:34:54.280]  with us here right the shotgun let's go
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:34:56.280]  to eagle eye army intelligence
[02:34:56.280 --> 02:34:58.280]  talks about the third missing component
[02:34:58.280 --> 02:35:00.280]  from Tennessee what's your view on this situation
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:02.280]  well
[02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:04.280]  I believe the strategically that this is
[02:35:04.280 --> 02:35:06.280]  the most important
[02:35:06.280 --> 02:35:08.280]  time frame for the gun attacks
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:10.280]  and the globalists tried to take back some
[02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:12.280]  sort of control because of the election
[02:35:12.280 --> 02:35:14.280]  it's all about the election
[02:35:14.280 --> 02:35:16.280]  they're going to do anything that they can
[02:35:16.280 --> 02:35:18.280]  to distract to intimidate
[02:35:18.280 --> 02:35:20.280]  to fear
[02:35:20.280 --> 02:35:22.280]  to threaten to use terrorism
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:24.280]  to their advantage to try to
[02:35:24.280 --> 02:35:26.280]  to effect voter turnout or whatever the case may be
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:30.280]  they're all about
[02:35:30.280 --> 02:35:32.280]  to distract you over here trying to get you down
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:34.280]  that rabbit hole and focus over here
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:36.280]  and then all of a sudden boom you get blindsided
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:38.280]  you know so we've got to watch out
[02:35:38.280 --> 02:35:40.280]  for that sort of thing
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:42.280]  but it wouldn't and it wouldn't surprise
[02:35:42.280 --> 02:35:44.280]  me that you know they're all in on this
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:46.280]  not just the Democrats
[02:35:46.280 --> 02:35:48.280]  but their allies
[02:35:48.280 --> 02:35:50.280]  across the globe
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:52.280]  their best interest in all of this
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:54.280]  is to take down Trump
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:56.280]  to take down the momentum before
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:58.280]  the next
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:00.280]  presidential election if they don't do it now
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:02.280]  they won't be able to stop it
[02:36:02.280 --> 02:36:04.280]  so it wouldn't surprise me that they're going to pull out
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:06.280]  all the stops now that being said
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:08.280]  you know this could potentially
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:10.280]  be the time frame that they would have
[02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.280]  another 9-11 type of
[02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:14.280]  event or something like that
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.280]  but I don't believe that that's going to be allowed
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:18.280]  to happen in my personal opinion
[02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:20.280]  this is all about fear
[02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:22.280]  this is all about keeping people away from the polls
[02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.280]  Eagle I want to be clear I agree
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:26.280]  because they don't have full command and control anymore
[02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:28.280]  and they know they're being watched
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:30.280]  they know the public is aware of false flag
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:32.280]  so they're not willing to pull off an Oklahoma State like they did before
[02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:34.280]  thank you Eagle I amazing points
[02:36:34.280 --> 02:36:36.280]  anything else
[02:36:36.280 --> 02:36:38.280]  just God bless you and keep playing
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:40.280]  if you're a veteran need to step up
[02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:42.280]  take family members that are afraid
[02:36:42.280 --> 02:36:44.280]  especially the elderly anybody that's afraid
[02:36:44.280 --> 02:36:46.280]  to go out to vote
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:48.280]  we've got family members that are veterans
[02:36:48.280 --> 02:36:50.280]  such as myself that are willing to take you out there
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:52.280]  and escort you don't be afraid get out and vote
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:54.280]  so early don't wait until election day
[02:36:54.280 --> 02:36:56.280]  it's key to vote early
[02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:58.280]  Eagle I you're absolutely right and let me expand on that
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:02.280]  my family has said watch out when you go vote
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:04.280]  have you voted yet and everybody knows
[02:37:04.280 --> 02:37:06.280]  about Antifa and they're out at parks with guns
[02:37:06.280 --> 02:37:08.280]  not even letting people have conservative marches
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:10.280]  I mean this is where I live
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:12.280]  this is going on
[02:37:12.280 --> 02:37:14.280]  and it is intimidating conservative voters
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:16.280]  we see record numbers turning out
[02:37:16.280 --> 02:37:18.280]  but especially women older folks
[02:37:18.280 --> 02:37:20.280]  I agree we need sons daughters
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:22.280]  even if you've got family that's five states away
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:24.280]  you need to vote early where you're at
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:26.280]  and get on a damn airplane excuse my French
[02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:28.280]  and get them to the polls Matt Bracken
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:32.280]  I think that these
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:34.280]  these democrat schemes if you want to call them that
[02:37:34.280 --> 02:37:36.280]  they would have worked 10 years ago
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:38.280]  and as we've been discussing
[02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:40.280]  in other shows
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:42.280]  the liberals are still living
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:44.280]  in that world they're in their insulated bubble
[02:37:44.280 --> 02:37:46.280]  going back to Dan Rather
[02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:48.280]  and the fake memo gate that would have flown
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:50.280]  that used to work but now
[02:37:50.280 --> 02:37:52.280]  when they pull these tricks especially coming after
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:54.280]  Kavanaugh Americans
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:56.280]  have seen what the democrats are capable
[02:37:56.280 --> 02:37:58.280]  of when when Trump
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:00.280]  at rallies says you know the democrats
[02:38:00.280 --> 02:38:02.280]  are going to turn our country into Venezuela
[02:38:02.280 --> 02:38:04.280]  it's not just hyper
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:06.280]  hyperbole people see it
[02:38:06.280 --> 02:38:08.280]  they see Kamala Harris and Cory Booker
[02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:10.280]  and they see a Cesar Chavez
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:12.280]  and a Maduro
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:14.280]  oh no these are crazy
[02:38:14.280 --> 02:38:16.280]  crazy power trippers
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:18.280]  I totally agree
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:20.280]  people now know how dangerous these
[02:38:20.280 --> 02:38:22.280]  these folks are
[02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:24.280]  people that haven't voted in years of voting
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:26.280]  they usually have under 30%
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:28.280]  turnout in Florida it's over 60%
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:30.280]  and it's running heavily
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:32.280]  Republican because people know
[02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:34.280]  that this is a make or break election
[02:38:34.280 --> 02:38:36.280]  you know even this fake bomb plot
[02:38:36.280 --> 02:38:38.280]  I think it's going to backfire
[02:38:38.280 --> 02:38:40.280]  because it's so clumsy
[02:38:40.280 --> 02:38:42.280]  there might be some real idiot liberals
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:44.280]  the real NPC meme face people
[02:38:44.280 --> 02:38:46.280]  might actually accept it at face value
[02:38:46.280 --> 02:38:48.280]  but the rest of us see a false flag
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:50.280]  well exactly
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:52.280]  if they busted him and the thing
[02:38:52.280 --> 02:38:54.280]  was it the student with professional sticker
[02:38:54.280 --> 02:38:56.280]  it's just all fake as hell
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:38:58.280]  and then they're openly saying we're going to get killed
[02:38:58.280 --> 02:39:00.280]  killing us and then it magically happens
[02:39:00.280 --> 02:39:02.280]  and then it's fake bombs
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:04.280]  they wouldn't even mail themselves real bombs
[02:39:04.280 --> 02:39:06.280]  I mean it just shows how stupid they think we are
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:08.280]  alright let's go to some more callers here
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:10.280]  with Matt Bracken who's up next here
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:12.280]  we got Matt in Texas
[02:39:12.280 --> 02:39:14.280]  Jack in Canada
[02:39:14.280 --> 02:39:16.280]  Jack here on the air go ahead thanks for holding
[02:39:16.280 --> 02:39:18.280]  hey once again
[02:39:18.280 --> 02:39:20.280]  tomorrow's news today on import.com
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:24.280]  yeah you nailed it right on the head there
[02:39:24.280 --> 02:39:26.280]  Alex absolutely
[02:39:26.280 --> 02:39:28.280]  well let's be clear though brother
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:30.280]  it's not hard when they're on every channel
[02:39:30.280 --> 02:39:32.280]  saying Trump and Alex Jones are going to bomb us
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:34.280]  and shoot us with no evidence of it
[02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:36.280]  then it pops up right on time I mean it's not hard
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:38.280]  exactly it's not hard
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:40.280]  but the thing is you've got lots of people out there
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:42.280]  that actually believe in television
[02:39:42.280 --> 02:39:44.280]  that's all they know they've been raised on television
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:46.280]  anything and everything that they've ever known
[02:39:46.280 --> 02:39:48.280]  has been on television
[02:39:48.280 --> 02:39:50.280]  like in the movie network
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:52.280]  right I mean
[02:39:52.280 --> 02:39:54.280]  tell them what to think we tell them what to say exactly
[02:39:54.280 --> 02:39:56.280]  exactly exactly
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:58.280]  and they eat it up
[02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.280]  and when they censor you
[02:40:00.280 --> 02:40:02.280]  and you can't
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:04.280]  counterpoint anything
[02:40:04.280 --> 02:40:06.280]  then people regurgitate the fake news
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:08.280]  like here in Canada
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:10.280]  all our news agencies
[02:40:10.280 --> 02:40:12.280]  regurgitate all the fake news from the United States
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:14.280]  and repackages it
[02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:16.280]  and sells it to us I mean they don't even mention
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:18.280]  about the caravan going on
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:20.280]  don't even mention about
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:22.280]  the connection with Adnan Khashoggi
[02:40:22.280 --> 02:40:24.280]  and his I don't know if it's his brother
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:26.280]  or his cousin and then you have the Khashoggi
[02:40:26.280 --> 02:40:28.280]  who got killed who had links
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:30.280]  to ISIS right
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:32.280]  it just goes on and on and on
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:34.280]  I mean you see this thing
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:36.280]  with the van
[02:40:36.280 --> 02:40:38.280]  you know what when I saw that van I went
[02:40:38.280 --> 02:40:40.280]  wait a second that is just
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:42.280]  too obvious and
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:44.280]  for some weird reason it reminded me of Las Vegas
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:46.280]  I don't know why
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:48.280]  but it just had that weird
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:50.280]  feel that
[02:40:50.280 --> 02:40:52.280]  just Las Vegas the thing about it
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:54.280]  oh and notice since we didn't buy
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:56.280]  Las Vegas they shut that down real quick
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:40:58.280]  thank you for the call Jack
[02:40:58.280 --> 02:41:00.280]  go ahead
[02:41:00.280 --> 02:41:02.280]  oh he's gone sorry I let you go too quick
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:04.280]  Matt I want to come back
[02:41:04.280 --> 02:41:06.280]  and just have you briefly let you go
[02:41:06.280 --> 02:41:08.280]  give us what the negative is though
[02:41:08.280 --> 02:41:10.280]  because I agree with this shows
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:12.280]  they admit with exit polls and people that
[02:41:12.280 --> 02:41:14.280]  have been polled that there's record
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:16.280]  numbers of republicans turning out
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:18.280]  they're turning out in the midterm
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:20.280]  it is a
[02:41:20.280 --> 02:41:22.280]  general election every four years
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:24.280]  but this is every two so
[02:41:24.280 --> 02:41:26.280]  A what might they pull in the next
[02:41:26.280 --> 02:41:28.280]  10 and a half days to stop this and B
[02:41:28.280 --> 02:41:30.280]  how could they grab
[02:41:30.280 --> 02:41:32.280]  victory from the jaws of defeat and then
[02:41:32.280 --> 02:41:34.280]  what do they do when they lose big time
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:36.280]  which all the numbers show because this is
[02:41:36.280 --> 02:41:38.280]  not a regular election this is a political
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:40.280]  once in a three generation
[02:41:40.280 --> 02:41:42.280]  political realignment
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:44.280]  is what's happening right now
[02:41:44.280 --> 02:41:46.280]  we're gonna go to break
[02:41:46.280 --> 02:41:48.280]  go ahead
[02:41:48.280 --> 02:41:50.280]  the last caller was saying it's like a
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:52.280]  Hollywood show but you know what people are
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:54.280]  hip to that too look at the movie shooter
[02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:56.280]  based on point of impact
[02:41:56.280 --> 02:41:58.280]  the whole idea of patsies and black and
[02:41:58.280 --> 02:42:00.280]  false flags it's mainstream
[02:42:00.280 --> 02:42:02.280]  now you know people when they see
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:04.280]  that van they laugh
[02:42:04.280 --> 02:42:06.280]  so I don't think it's gonna have the effect
[02:42:06.280 --> 02:42:08.280]  they're still living in the old days when they could manipulate
[02:42:08.280 --> 02:42:10.280]  us we now are hip to false
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:12.280]  flags we know this
[02:42:12.280 --> 02:42:14.280]  and they couldn't help but make it all be perfectly
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:16.280]  wrapped and clean and popping
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:18.280]  clearly in a production instead of
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:20.280]  like an old sticker or something because that would
[02:42:20.280 --> 02:42:22.280]  take something old that would take some work
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:24.280]  it's easy to get a new van and plaster all this on it
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:26.280]  it's so lazy
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:28.280]  yeah it's it's it's just too pat
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:30.280]  it's the acme bomb factory
[02:42:30.280 --> 02:42:32.280]  all right I want to just real quickly
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:34.280]  on the side boom boom boom what are what should we be
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:36.280]  looking at on our six what happens if they lose big
[02:42:36.280 --> 02:42:38.280]  which I believe they will unless there's massive
[02:42:38.280 --> 02:42:40.280]  election fraud all the numbers show it we are
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:42.280]  at 10 and a half days from destiny

[02:47:49.280 --> 02:47:51.280]  they try to censor us and block us

[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:55.280]  but that's why during a crisis
[02:47:55.280 --> 02:47:57.280]  we always post an article
[02:47:57.280 --> 02:47:59.280]  and send it out to everybody that has the droid
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:01.280]  and Apple app
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:03.280]  because even though we had millions and millions of people that got on it in a month
[02:48:03.280 --> 02:48:05.280]  when they banned us
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:07.280]  you still have it on your phone
[02:48:07.280 --> 02:48:09.280]  so you get the alerts so it's key for you to then email
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:11.280]  and text message everybody you know
[02:48:11.280 --> 02:48:13.280]  saying hey we're broadcasting the truth
[02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:15.280]  that the enemy
[02:48:15.280 --> 02:48:17.280]  that the globalist wants censored because we are the real voice of America
[02:48:17.280 --> 02:48:19.280]  the globalist actually
[02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:21.280]  recognizes that
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:23.280]  and they're trying to stop us
[02:48:23.280 --> 02:48:25.280]  now I didn't see it everybody's calling about it
[02:48:25.280 --> 02:48:27.280]  and I guess Trump's live on C-SPAN
[02:48:27.280 --> 02:48:29.280]  and he's interviewing
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:31.280]  young black conservatives and our own Will Johnson's there
[02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:33.280]  talking about info wars
[02:48:33.280 --> 02:48:35.280]  info wars censorship so
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:37.280]  that'll be coming up later too
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:39.280]  and we're trying to make it front and center for the president
[02:48:39.280 --> 02:48:41.280]  to talk about that
[02:48:41.280 --> 02:48:43.280]  and to
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:45.280]  understand that censorship is the key and I know
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:47.280]  he understands that but we've got to really push that through the next level
[02:48:47.280 --> 02:48:49.280]  but here's some of the articles
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:51.280]  they call it the Alex Jonesification
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:53.280]  of
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:55.280]  the right wing
[02:48:55.280 --> 02:48:57.280]  no it's not that it's the common sense
[02:48:57.280 --> 02:48:59.280]  here's another one weekly standard
[02:48:59.280 --> 02:49:01.280]  the children of Alex Jones
[02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:03.280]  oh my god the evil Candace Owens
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:05.280]  she there questions the motive of these bombings
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:07.280]  and how they're fake
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:09.280]  I mean that's just common sense
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:11.280]  so they're all over the news freaking out
[02:49:11.280 --> 02:49:13.280]  that
[02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:15.280]  we dare to be questioning things
[02:49:15.280 --> 02:49:17.280]  what do you expect them to pull next Matt
[02:49:17.280 --> 02:49:19.280]  because people aren't buying this
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:21.280]  I don't think that there's going to be
[02:49:21.280 --> 02:49:23.280]  any kind of a directive that goes down
[02:49:23.280 --> 02:49:25.280]  that's passed down
[02:49:25.280 --> 02:49:27.280]  this is again at that
[02:49:27.280 --> 02:49:29.280]  insect hive pheromone level
[02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:31.280]  but I think the panic is
[02:49:31.280 --> 02:49:33.280]  setting in as they realize
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:35.280]  there's no blue wave and it might even be a red wave
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:37.280]  so I think that
[02:49:37.280 --> 02:49:39.280]  hold on we're going to come right back to you
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:41.280]  they've started the press conference 19 minutes late
[02:49:41.280 --> 02:49:43.280]  stay there Matt Bracken and collars
[02:49:43.280 --> 02:49:45.280]  let's see what Sessions is saying
[02:49:45.280 --> 02:49:47.280]  a Hollywood actor
[02:49:47.280 --> 02:49:49.280]  and at least seven high rank
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:51.280]  current and former political leaders
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:49:53.280]  in the Democratic Party
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:55.280]  this is utterly unacceptable
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:49:57.280]  political violence
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:49:59.280]  or the threat of violence
[02:49:59.280 --> 02:50:01.280]  is antithetical to our vigorous
[02:50:01.280 --> 02:50:03.280]  system of self-government
[02:50:03.280 --> 02:50:05.280]  it is a threat
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:07.280]  to that respect
[02:50:07.280 --> 02:50:09.280]  for law and process
[02:50:09.280 --> 02:50:11.280]  that allows our
[02:50:11.280 --> 02:50:13.280]  so we never see Sessions until it's butt kissing
[02:50:13.280 --> 02:50:15.280]  Democrats, elections, court rulings
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:17.280]  with which they do not agree
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:19.280]  this is the central
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:21.280]  feature of our system of self-government
[02:50:21.280 --> 02:50:23.280]  we're not for violence, they're the ones that are
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:25.280]  we're not for beliefs, enthusiastically
[02:50:25.280 --> 02:50:27.280]  but we peaceably and lawfully
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:29.280]  comply with the results
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:31.280]  please know that from the beginning
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:33.280]  this investigative team
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:35.280]  has made this matter a top priority
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:37.280]  focusing their great
[02:50:37.280 --> 02:50:39.280]  we're going to go back to this in a minute
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:41.280]  I can't listen to it
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:43.280]  yes it's illegal, we have a law
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:45.280]  violence is wrong
[02:50:45.280 --> 02:50:47.280]  and it was wrong to shoot Scalise
[02:50:47.280 --> 02:50:49.280]  it was wrong to break the ribs of Rand Paul
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:51.280]  it's wrong to call for the president's killing
[02:50:51.280 --> 02:50:53.280]  just the way the Republicans fall into this thing
[02:50:53.280 --> 02:50:55.280]  of letting the left direct it all
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:57.280]  I would use the press conference
[02:50:57.280 --> 02:50:59.280]  to expose all their violence
[02:50:59.280 --> 02:51:01.280]  because they're all chomping at the bed attacking Republicans
[02:51:01.280 --> 02:51:03.280]  I think this is a major miscalculation again
[02:51:03.280 --> 02:51:05.280]  Matt
[02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:07.280]  it's major and
[02:51:07.280 --> 02:51:09.280]  I can't believe
[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:11.280]  they rolled Sessions out for this, where's he been
[02:51:11.280 --> 02:51:13.280]  he's on life support somewhere
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:15.280]  he's like a blue moon
[02:51:15.280 --> 02:51:17.280]  he pops up once a year
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:19.280]  I think
[02:51:19.280 --> 02:51:21.280]  we could possibly see
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:23.280]  a lone actor with a gun
[02:51:23.280 --> 02:51:25.280]  do another Scalise type operation
[02:51:25.280 --> 02:51:27.280]  or
[02:51:27.280 --> 02:51:29.280]  instead of yelling at somebody in a restaurant
[02:51:29.280 --> 02:51:31.280]  it could be a gun
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:33.280]  but the most effect
[02:51:33.280 --> 02:51:35.280]  that would just be out of anger and counterproductive
[02:51:35.280 --> 02:51:37.280]  to the left
[02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:39.280]  but the most effective thing would be a shooting
[02:51:39.280 --> 02:51:41.280]  against a liberal crowd
[02:51:41.280 --> 02:51:43.280]  with right wing literature left
[02:51:43.280 --> 02:51:45.280]  see the good thing about the fake pipe bomb
[02:51:45.280 --> 02:51:47.280]  is it happened two weeks out
[02:51:47.280 --> 02:51:49.280]  if
[02:51:49.280 --> 02:51:51.280]  just four or five days before an election
[02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:53.280]  a liberal crowd is shot up
[02:51:53.280 --> 02:51:55.280]  and right wing literature is left
[02:51:55.280 --> 02:51:57.280]  that's going to be more effective
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:51:59.280]  now the only saving grace here is
[02:51:59.280 --> 02:52:01.280]  thanks to info wars
[02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:03.280]  and people like
[02:52:03.280 --> 02:52:05.280]  writers like me with my novels
[02:52:05.280 --> 02:52:07.280]  people are way hipper to the false flag
[02:52:07.280 --> 02:52:09.280]  today and they just aren't going to accept anything
[02:52:09.280 --> 02:52:11.280]  no I totally agree
[02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:13.280]  but let me raise this point, what about all his priors
[02:52:13.280 --> 02:52:15.280]  that he was known for all these bomb threats
[02:52:15.280 --> 02:52:17.280]  here it is, mail bomb sender
[02:52:17.280 --> 02:52:19.280]  Caesar
[02:52:19.280 --> 02:52:21.280]  Priors
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:23.280]  91 theft, 94 domestic violence
[02:52:23.280 --> 02:52:25.280]  03 bomb threat, 04 illegal ID
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:27.280]  04 controlled substance, 04
[02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:29.280]  evidence tampering, 09 foreclosure
[02:52:29.280 --> 02:52:31.280]  09 operative metal license
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:33.280]  13 theft, 13 battery
[02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:35.280]  14 theft, 15 prohibition
[02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:37.280]  violation plus many
[02:52:37.280 --> 02:52:39.280]  traffic and drug arrest, this guy is the perfect
[02:52:39.280 --> 02:52:41.280]  patsy
[02:52:41.280 --> 02:52:43.280]  shut up guy, promised to deal
[02:52:43.280 --> 02:52:45.280]  by coward county
[02:52:45.280 --> 02:52:47.280]  mafia, I mean this guy
[02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:49.280]  fits the M.O.
[02:52:49.280 --> 02:52:51.280]  yeah he's perfect
[02:52:51.280 --> 02:52:53.280]  a lot will be determined
[02:52:53.280 --> 02:52:55.280]  by what happens with his social media history
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:57.280]  if he
[02:52:57.280 --> 02:52:59.280]  if they can recover his old social media
[02:52:59.280 --> 02:53:01.280]  and it's 180 degrees out from
[02:53:01.280 --> 02:53:03.280]  his newly established social media
[02:53:03.280 --> 02:53:05.280]  that'll be a clue right there
[02:53:05.280 --> 02:53:07.280]  but if all of this happened in the last month
[02:53:07.280 --> 02:53:09.280]  then it'll look more like
[02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:11.280]  somebody got a handle on him
[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:13.280]  and is just out and out
[02:53:13.280 --> 02:53:15.280]  using him, he might have enough priors
[02:53:15.280 --> 02:53:17.280]  to send him away and he's willing
[02:53:17.280 --> 02:53:19.280]  to do anything
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:21.280]  they might have caught him in the middle of another scam
[02:53:21.280 --> 02:53:23.280]  and they've offered him a way out of it
[02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:25.280]  alright thank you so much
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:27.280]  Matt Bracken will talk to you again
[02:53:27.280 --> 02:53:29.280]  very soon, I'm gonna host a little bit in the next hour
[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:31.280]  to go to Greg and Matt and Aaron and Jeff and Garrett
[02:53:31.280 --> 02:53:33.280]  I'll get to all of you and then we have a special guest
[02:53:33.280 --> 02:53:35.280]  joining us but right now Director Ray
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:37.280]  is out here, let's hear what he has to say
[02:53:37.280 --> 02:53:39.280]  about his background
[02:53:39.280 --> 02:53:41.280]  or about his motive
[02:53:41.280 --> 02:53:43.280]  what I can say is that this was a nationwide
[02:53:43.280 --> 02:53:45.280]  investigation of enormous
[02:53:45.280 --> 02:53:47.280]  scope and of the greatest
[02:53:47.280 --> 02:53:49.280]  importance. Our investigation
[02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:51.280]  ranged from New York to Delaware
[02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:53.280]  to Maryland to the
[02:53:53.280 --> 02:53:55.280]  District of Columbia to Florida
[02:53:55.280 --> 02:53:57.280]  to California
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:53:59.280]  and as it always
[02:53:59.280 --> 02:54:01.280]  does the FBI responded with every
[02:54:01.280 --> 02:54:03.280]  resource we've got including
[02:54:03.280 --> 02:54:05.280]  our Joint Terrorism Task Forces
[02:54:05.280 --> 02:54:07.280]  our Counterterrorism Division
[02:54:07.280 --> 02:54:09.280]  and our world renowned
[02:54:09.280 --> 02:54:11.280]  experts at the FBI lab
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:13.280]  world renowned experts
[02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:15.280]  but and I really can't
[02:54:15.280 --> 02:54:17.280]  underscore this enough
[02:54:17.280 --> 02:54:19.280]  we did not act alone
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:21.280]  the FBI crime lab is famous for framing people
[02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:23.280]  it is full of leftists
[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:25.280]  represented up here today
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:27.280]  a threat of this scope and of this magnitude
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:29.280]  requires all of us
[02:54:29.280 --> 02:54:31.280]  working show
[02:54:31.280 --> 02:54:33.280]  I can't listen turn it off
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:35.280]  a threat of this scope and this magnitude
[02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:37.280]  can we queue up the police commissioner
[02:54:37.280 --> 02:54:39.280]  saying there was no real powder in the bombs
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:41.280]  these were not bombs
[02:54:43.280 --> 02:54:45.280]  we put these joke road flares
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:47.280]  together because they're more dangerous
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:49.280]  as a road flare if you let one you can burn a building down
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:51.280]  these are more dangerous
[02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:53.280]  than the crap
[02:54:53.280 --> 02:54:55.280]  the crap
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:57.280]  the crap
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:54:59.280]  that was mailed out and he sits up there
[02:54:59.280 --> 02:55:01.280]  this is the greatest danger like a nuclear
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:03.280]  weapons missing or something
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:05.280]  I mean just
[02:55:05.280 --> 02:55:07.280]  all he should be up there saying no one's
[02:55:07.280 --> 02:55:09.280]  in danger these are fake like
[02:55:09.280 --> 02:55:11.280]  the New York commissioner did
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:13.280]  but no
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:15.280]  or other FBI agents that have been all over
[02:55:15.280 --> 02:55:17.280]  Fox News saying this is fake no
[02:55:17.280 --> 02:55:19.280]  he's up there this is the greatest
[02:55:19.280 --> 02:55:21.280]  threat this is deadly dangerous
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:23.280]  oh my god it's the worst thing
[02:55:23.280 --> 02:55:25.280]  we've ever seen in our life here let's hear more
[02:55:25.280 --> 02:55:27.280]  of this garbage
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:29.280]  it's known as energetic material
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:31.280]  which is essentially potential explosives
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:33.280]  and material that give off
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:35.280]  heat and energy
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:37.280]  for a reaction to heat
[02:55:37.280 --> 02:55:39.280]  they're now having to explain there was no powder
[02:55:39.280 --> 02:55:41.280]  but it had potentially energetic material
[02:55:47.280 --> 02:55:49.280]  I want to focus for a moment
[02:55:49.280 --> 02:55:51.280]  on the amazing work of our folks at the FBI
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:53.280]  lab and then look this guy looks like
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:55.280]  an MS-13 member
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:55:57.280]  they uncovered a latent fingerprint
[02:55:57.280 --> 02:55:59.280]  from one of the envelopes containing
[02:55:59.280 --> 02:56:01.280]  an IED
[02:56:01.280 --> 02:56:03.280]  that had been sent to congresswoman Maxine Waters
[02:56:03.280 --> 02:56:05.280]  it was not an IED
[02:56:05.280 --> 02:56:07.280]  this fingerprint
[02:56:07.280 --> 02:56:09.280]  is that of Cesar Sayak
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:11.280]  turn it off just turn it off
[02:56:11.280 --> 02:56:13.280]  I'm gonna go to break come back right back with your calls
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:15.280]  ending the shower don't forget free shipping

[02:56:17.280 --> 02:56:19.280]  biggest sale ever without your purchases
[02:56:19.280 --> 02:56:21.280]  without your support we will
[02:56:21.280 --> 02:56:23.280]  not be able to continue
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:25.280]  you hear sponsors on the radio your sponsors on local stations
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:27.280]  support them that's great
[02:56:27.280 --> 02:56:29.280]  we're almost exclusively funded
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:31.280]  by you getting t-shirts books water filtration
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:33.280]  air filtration and
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:35.280]  you know they've been trying to shut us down so I said
[02:56:35.280 --> 02:56:37.280]  the product we've got through Christmas
[02:56:37.280 --> 02:56:39.280]  I want to sell it all now
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:41.280]  and all the big sales
[02:56:41.280 --> 02:56:43.280]  we have for black friday and for christmas
[02:56:43.280 --> 02:56:45.280]  and for cyber monday I said let's just do them all
[02:56:45.280 --> 02:56:47.280]  now and they've been successful we've sold a lot
[02:56:47.280 --> 02:56:49.280]  of product we haven't made much profit on each thing
[02:56:49.280 --> 02:56:51.280]  but I had to get it out of our warehouse in case
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:53.280]  they took our payment processors
[02:56:53.280 --> 02:56:55.280]  they took five of our six
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:57.280]  we now have two backups
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:56:59.280]  don't mean we're totally out of the woods
[02:56:59.280 --> 02:57:01.280]  we got contracts this time but they won't discriminate
[02:57:01.280 --> 02:57:03.280]  it's for our political activities or lies in the media
[02:57:03.280 --> 02:57:05.280]  so that'll really upset George Soros
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:07.280]  media matters but the sales
[02:57:07.280 --> 02:57:09.280]  have to end the sales have
[02:57:09.280 --> 02:57:11.280]  to end especially on brain
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:13.280]  force it's selling out especially
[02:57:13.280 --> 02:57:15.280]  on x2 it's the last run of that we were unable
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:17.280]  to secure more of it but I had a little trick up my
[02:57:17.280 --> 02:57:19.280]  sleeve you'll hear about next week

[02:58:09.280 --> 02:58:11.280]  of censorship in which they want
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:13.280]  to strangle our first amendment

[02:59:51.280 --> 02:59:53.280]  show
[02:59:59.280 --> 03:00:01.280]  waging war on corruption

[03:00:07.280 --> 03:00:09.280]  well even CNN
[03:00:09.280 --> 03:00:11.280]  had analysts on saying the false flag
[03:00:11.280 --> 03:00:13.280]  theory could be real I mean obviously
[03:00:13.280 --> 03:00:15.280]  who stands to gain people get caught all the time
[03:00:15.280 --> 03:00:17.280]  doing things politically to themselves
[03:00:17.280 --> 03:00:19.280]  to blame their enemy that's as old as
[03:00:19.280 --> 03:00:21.280]  humanity
[03:00:21.280 --> 03:00:23.280]  but there's literally hundreds of articles
[03:00:23.280 --> 03:00:25.280]  out saying I'm a horrible mean person I'm bad
[03:00:25.280 --> 03:00:27.280]  but the good news is most people
[03:00:27.280 --> 03:00:29.280]  even some of the crew
[03:00:29.280 --> 03:00:31.280]  are more socially liberal but they're patriots
[03:00:31.280 --> 03:00:33.280]  they're you know they like to show
[03:00:33.280 --> 03:00:35.280]  I don't make people be total right wingers to work here

[03:01:17.280 --> 03:01:19.280]  and a half maybe two hours
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:21.280]  and all the guys ahead of me have made fantastic
[03:01:21.280 --> 03:01:23.280]  points kind of stole my thunder
[03:01:23.280 --> 03:01:25.280]  so I won't waste a lot of your time
[03:01:25.280 --> 03:01:27.280]  I want to let you know that there are supporters out here
[03:01:27.280 --> 03:01:29.280]  millions and millions of us
[03:01:29.280 --> 03:01:31.280]  you know we believe we're smart
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:33.280]  we understand what's going on
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:35.280]  we see what's going on
[03:01:35.280 --> 03:01:37.280]  we're putting two and two together
[03:01:39.280 --> 03:01:41.280]  we thank you for what you're doing
[03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:43.280]  and just a quick shout out
[03:01:43.280 --> 03:01:45.280]  to the Oath Peepers who are also working in North Florida
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:47.280]  helping people get
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:49.280]  recovered from the hurricane
[03:01:49.280 --> 03:01:51.280]  I mean I wish I had more
[03:01:51.280 --> 03:01:53.280]  but you know the former callers
[03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:55.280]  have covered everything very well
[03:01:55.280 --> 03:01:57.280]  so thank you very much keep up what you're doing
[03:01:57.280 --> 03:01:59.280]  no no thank you brother I know you got to go Aaron
[03:01:59.280 --> 03:02:01.280]  but real quick just
[03:02:01.280 --> 03:02:03.280]  your approximation of this
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:05.280]  everybody seems to think it's a hoax
[03:02:05.280 --> 03:02:07.280]  do you think this is a win for the Democrats
[03:02:07.280 --> 03:02:09.280]  or a loss
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:11.280]  I think it's a massive loss
[03:02:11.280 --> 03:02:13.280]  I think it's going to drive Republicans out through the polls
[03:02:13.280 --> 03:02:15.280]  you can already see it in Florida early voting
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:17.280]  I think this is the dumbest thing
[03:02:17.280 --> 03:02:19.280]  they've ever tried to come up with
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:21.280]  and a previous caller
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:23.280]  said yes this is all Hollywood
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:25.280]  they're targeting people
[03:02:25.280 --> 03:02:27.280]  that sit on the couch and do nothing but watch TV
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:29.280]  or TV event great points Aaron
[03:02:29.280 --> 03:02:31.280]  and you know here is

[03:02:41.280 --> 03:02:43.280]  all these other people
[03:02:43.280 --> 03:02:45.280]  Lou Dobbs are saying
[03:02:45.280 --> 03:02:47.280]  the evidence is clear it's a staged event
[03:02:47.280 --> 03:02:49.280]  they don't know what to do
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:51.280]  yes it's right
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:53.280]  we don't trust you guys anymore

[03:02:59.280 --> 03:03:01.280]  he says he trains police
[03:03:01.280 --> 03:03:03.280]  and law enforcement he's police
[03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:05.280]  Army Navy Marines on explosives
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:07.280]  Greg thanks for holding
[03:03:07.280 --> 03:03:09.280]  what's your take on this
[03:03:09.280 --> 03:03:11.280]  absolute training
[03:03:11.280 --> 03:03:13.280]  absolute fake
[03:03:13.280 --> 03:03:15.280]  we've made
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:17.280]  stuff in training that look more real
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:19.280]  than this and you could tell
[03:03:19.280 --> 03:03:21.280]  that this was made
[03:03:21.280 --> 03:03:23.280]  I mean seriously
[03:03:23.280 --> 03:03:25.280]  we can't just send something
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:27.280]  through the mail like that
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:29.280]  and not get picked up by the scanners
[03:03:29.280 --> 03:03:31.280]  get picked up by the trained staff
[03:03:31.280 --> 03:03:33.280]  especially after 9-11
[03:03:33.280 --> 03:03:35.280]  a K-9 dog
[03:03:35.280 --> 03:03:37.280]  gets sent in
[03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:39.280]  after a call
[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:41.280]  of explosives
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:43.280]  or a suspicious package
[03:03:43.280 --> 03:03:45.280]  it doesn't need a state of the art
[03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:51.280]  identification
[03:03:51.280 --> 03:03:53.280]  you can pick out explosives
[03:03:53.280 --> 03:03:55.280]  well here's an example
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:57.280]  I tried to ship jelly in my check-in bags
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:03:59.280]  and because a thing of jelly
[03:03:59.280 --> 03:04:01.280]  grape jelly I got in Omaha
[03:04:01.280 --> 03:04:03.280]  might have been an explosive
[03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:05.280]  they took it and there was a letter in my bag
[03:04:05.280 --> 03:04:07.280]  and again they think couriers brought this though
[03:04:07.280 --> 03:04:09.280]  and then oh that's another question
[03:04:09.280 --> 03:04:11.280]  this guy's the new speedy Gonzalez
[03:04:11.280 --> 03:04:13.280]  how did he deliver it magically
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:15.280]  in some cases hand delivered
[03:04:15.280 --> 03:04:17.280]  to all these locations simultaneously
[03:04:17.280 --> 03:04:19.280]  yeah right
[03:04:19.280 --> 03:04:21.280]  it's just laughable
[03:04:21.280 --> 03:04:23.280]  and in New York
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:25.280]  with all the cameras
[03:04:25.280 --> 03:04:27.280]  all the CCTVs
[03:04:27.280 --> 03:04:29.280]  they've got going on
[03:04:29.280 --> 03:04:31.280]  one of my head instructors
[03:04:31.280 --> 03:04:33.280]  right don't hang up you're not going to wait anymore
[03:04:33.280 --> 03:04:35.280]  60 seconds for them to come back
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:37.280]  one of your head instructors told you what stay there
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:39.280]  and then who do you think is behind this then
[03:04:39.280 --> 03:04:41.280]  what were they thinking
[03:04:41.280 --> 03:04:43.280]  why is it so hand fisted
[03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:45.280]  and why do they height these terror attacks
[03:04:45.280 --> 03:04:47.280]  were coming against the left
[03:04:47.280 --> 03:04:49.280]  so scripted
[03:04:49.280 --> 03:04:51.280]  it's so ridiculously fake
[03:04:51.280 --> 03:05:18.280]  we've already had incredible success
[03:05:18.280 --> 03:05:21.280]  but if you will simply realize how epic this is
[03:05:21.280 --> 03:05:23.280]  and understand how real this fight is
[03:05:23.280 --> 03:05:25.280]  and why we've been made the main target
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:27.280]  and if you financially support us
[03:05:27.280 --> 03:05:29.280]  and if you spread the word about our articles
[03:05:29.280 --> 03:05:31.280]  and videos m4s.com
[03:05:31.280 --> 03:05:34.280]  we won't just continue to stand up against these
[03:05:34.280 --> 03:05:36.280]  brutal scumbags we'll win
[03:05:36.280 --> 03:05:39.280]  we have huge sales m4store.com right now
[03:05:39.280 --> 03:05:41.280]  and we're still able to operate
[03:05:41.280 --> 03:05:43.280]  the shopping cart and get stuff shipped out to you
[03:05:43.280 --> 03:05:45.280]  despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce
[03:05:45.280 --> 03:05:47.280]  and you're right to the market
[03:05:47.280 --> 03:05:49.280]  you don't stand up and support us financially
[03:05:49.280 --> 03:05:51.280]  soar us the global spain win
[03:05:51.280 --> 03:05:53.280]  this is m4's darkest hour
[03:05:53.280 --> 03:05:55.280]  with your support I'm counting on you
[03:05:59.280 --> 03:06:01.280]  from the front lines
[03:06:01.280 --> 03:06:03.280]  of the information war
[03:06:03.280 --> 03:06:05.280]  it's alex jones
[03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:10.280]  bombscare shows that alex jones' legacy
[03:06:10.280 --> 03:06:12.280]  is more conspiracy theories
[03:06:12.280 --> 03:06:14.280]  and more conspiracy theorist
[03:06:14.280 --> 03:06:16.280]  that's the weekly standard
[03:06:16.280 --> 03:06:18.280]  the fresno b
[03:06:18.280 --> 03:06:20.280]  the associated press
[03:06:20.280 --> 03:06:22.280]  mother jones pathos
[03:06:22.280 --> 03:06:24.280]  the new york times
[03:06:24.280 --> 03:06:26.280]  they're all saying I'm gone
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:28.280]  I don't exist anymore they defeated me
[03:06:28.280 --> 03:06:30.280]  I'm off air
[03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:32.280]  but I gave birth
[03:06:32.280 --> 03:06:34.280]  to rush limbaugh
[03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:36.280]  and candisowans
[03:06:36.280 --> 03:06:38.280]  no I didn't
[03:06:38.280 --> 03:06:40.280]  this audience
[03:06:40.280 --> 03:06:42.280]  you I
[03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:44.280]  Matt drudge people just covering real news
[03:06:44.280 --> 03:06:46.280]  and we made it safe for other people
[03:06:46.280 --> 03:06:48.280]  to cover reality
[03:06:48.280 --> 03:06:50.280]  and question and not just believe false narratives
[03:06:50.280 --> 03:06:52.280]  were given over and over again
[03:06:52.280 --> 03:06:54.280]  but it's the weirdest thing
[03:06:54.280 --> 03:06:56.280]  it's like
[03:06:56.280 --> 03:06:58.280]  the local paper like every day has articles
[03:06:58.280 --> 03:07:00.280]  alex jones is gone now
[03:07:00.280 --> 03:07:02.280]  alex jones was defeated
[03:07:02.280 --> 03:07:04.280]  because the truth is alex jones in this great audience
[03:07:04.280 --> 03:07:06.280]  we got trump elected
[03:07:06.280 --> 03:07:08.280]  and the truth is the country's coming back
[03:07:08.280 --> 03:07:10.280]  and the truth is we did amazing things
[03:07:10.280 --> 03:07:12.280]  and you are heroes as an audience
[03:07:12.280 --> 03:07:14.280]  and we're doing amazing action
[03:07:14.280 --> 03:07:16.280]  and we've done heroic work here
[03:07:16.280 --> 03:07:18.280]  this great crew
[03:07:18.280 --> 03:07:20.280]  they're not going to let everybody see how competent
[03:07:20.280 --> 03:07:22.280]  and how smart and what winners we are
[03:07:22.280 --> 03:07:24.280]  they have to rebrand us as the failures
[03:07:24.280 --> 03:07:26.280]  but now you see
[03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:28.280]  rush limbaugh
[03:07:28.280 --> 03:07:30.280]  and
[03:07:30.280 --> 03:07:32.280]  everyone else
[03:07:32.280 --> 03:07:34.280]  they must be taken off the air
[03:07:34.280 --> 03:07:36.280]  because now they're like alex jones
[03:07:36.280 --> 03:07:38.280]  and well we took him off
[03:07:38.280 --> 03:07:40.280]  so now we take everyone else off
[03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:42.280]  we can't let them question us
[03:07:42.280 --> 03:07:44.280]  we can't let them do that
[03:07:44.280 --> 03:07:46.280]  no
[03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:48.280]  it's unamerican to have speech
[03:07:48.280 --> 03:07:50.280]  look at this
[03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:52.280]  the children of alex jones
[03:07:52.280 --> 03:07:54.280]  kendis owens
[03:07:54.280 --> 03:07:56.280]  and rush limbaugh
[03:07:56.280 --> 03:07:58.280]  the condescension
[03:07:58.280 --> 03:08:00.280]  of that
[03:08:00.280 --> 03:08:02.280]  false flag theory on pipe bombs
[03:08:02.280 --> 03:08:04.280]  they're not bombs, the police said they're fake
[03:08:04.280 --> 03:08:06.280]  zooms from right wing fringe to mainstream
[03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:08.280]  new york times
[03:08:08.280 --> 03:08:10.280]  oh no
[03:08:10.280 --> 03:08:12.280]  it came from alex jones
[03:08:12.280 --> 03:08:14.280]  oh no
[03:08:14.280 --> 03:08:16.280]  hans blicks
[03:08:16.280 --> 03:08:18.280]  oh no
[03:08:18.280 --> 03:08:20.280]  come on in hans blicks
[03:08:20.280 --> 03:08:22.280]  redrops him into the shark tank
[03:08:26.280 --> 03:08:28.280]  i love though the one line is
[03:08:28.280 --> 03:08:30.280]  it's true
[03:08:30.280 --> 03:08:32.280]  the alex jonesification of the right
[03:08:32.280 --> 03:08:34.280]  is now complete
[03:08:34.280 --> 03:08:36.280]  and i'm far from gone
[03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:38.280]  and they know that
[03:08:38.280 --> 03:08:40.280]  and it's not about a power trip
[03:08:40.280 --> 03:08:42.280]  but when people are trying to destroy you
[03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:44.280]  and have done everything they can
[03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:46.280]  to silence you but the people stand by you
[03:08:46.280 --> 03:08:48.280]  and you come through the storm
[03:08:48.280 --> 03:08:50.280]  battered but stronger
[03:08:50.280 --> 03:08:52.280]  battle hardened is the word
[03:08:52.280 --> 03:08:54.280]  and just to see everything they're doing
[03:08:54.280 --> 03:08:56.280]  we're gonna win this thing
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:58.280]  i don't know how hard it's gonna be
[03:08:58.280 --> 03:09:00.280]  or how long it's gonna go but
[03:09:00.280 --> 03:09:02.280]  i used to say i don't know how this is gonna end
[03:09:02.280 --> 03:09:04.280]  but if you want to fight you better believe you got one
[03:09:04.280 --> 03:09:06.280]  and now i can tell you
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:08.280]  i don't know how it's gonna end
[03:09:08.280 --> 03:09:10.280]  but we're gonna win
[03:09:10.280 --> 03:09:12.280]  and i could really at a gut level tell you that
[03:09:12.280 --> 03:09:14.280]  when trump got elected that night
[03:09:14.280 --> 03:09:16.280]  i was processing what we were gonna have to go through
[03:09:16.280 --> 03:09:18.280]  and i was shaken
[03:09:18.280 --> 03:09:20.280]  but now two years into the fight
[03:09:20.280 --> 03:09:22.280]  i'm still shaken
[03:09:22.280 --> 03:09:24.280]  but we're gonna win and that really is what matters
[03:09:30.280 --> 03:09:32.280]  that's a funny thing from that night
[03:09:32.280 --> 03:09:34.280]  i've aged some haven't i
[03:09:34.280 --> 03:09:36.280]  but that's good, that's my struggle
[03:09:36.280 --> 03:09:38.280]  i expect to age hard
[03:09:38.280 --> 03:09:40.280]  by trying to sit here and be a little pretty boy
[03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:42.280]  i expect to expend my entire soul and will
[03:09:42.280 --> 03:09:44.280]  on the fight
[03:09:44.280 --> 03:09:46.280]  for a greater future for everybody because we are the future
[03:09:46.280 --> 03:09:48.280]  alright, greg in Iowa
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:50.280]  thanks for holding while i was ranting
[03:09:50.280 --> 03:09:52.280]  you were making some great points
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:54.280]  about this whole thing saying it's
[03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:56.280]  when you heard the earlier caller that trained post office
[03:09:56.280 --> 03:09:58.280]  he was saying it's literally the template
[03:09:58.280 --> 03:10:00.280]  of what a fake package looks like
[03:10:00.280 --> 03:10:02.280]  they're trained to discover
[03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:04.280]  so it was meant to instantly be noticed
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:06.280]  once it even got to the mail room at CNN
[03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:08.280]  right
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:10.280]  exactly
[03:10:10.280 --> 03:10:12.280]  how did they
[03:10:12.280 --> 03:10:14.280]  even get through the mail system if it even
[03:10:14.280 --> 03:10:16.280]  in doubt went through the mail system
[03:10:16.280 --> 03:10:18.280]  see in the military we would even
[03:10:18.280 --> 03:10:20.280]  work with Hollywood
[03:10:20.280 --> 03:10:22.280]  Camp Pendleton, Florida
[03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:24.280]  and other places
[03:10:24.280 --> 03:10:26.280]  they would help us make
[03:10:26.280 --> 03:10:28.280]  our urban warfare
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:30.280]  places
[03:10:30.280 --> 03:10:32.280]  with fake IEDs
[03:10:32.280 --> 03:10:34.280]  as urban warfare
[03:10:34.280 --> 03:10:36.280]  instructor
[03:10:36.280 --> 03:10:38.280]  teaching house to house room to room combat
[03:10:38.280 --> 03:10:40.280]  they would make missiles
[03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:42.280]  fake
[03:10:42.280 --> 03:10:44.280]  blood, fake wounds
[03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:46.280]  for us
[03:10:46.280 --> 03:10:48.280]  their special effects people
[03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:50.280]  as a
[03:10:50.280 --> 03:10:52.280]  combat engineer
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:10:54.280]  which i specialized in early on in my career
[03:10:54.280 --> 03:10:56.280]  we would make fake explosives
[03:10:56.280 --> 03:10:58.280]  that looked even more real than this
[03:10:58.280 --> 03:11:00.280]  but see that that's the problem
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:02.280]  you may be
[03:11:02.280 --> 03:11:04.280]  able to like in Bosnia
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:06.280]  where I did a lot of minefield clearing
[03:11:06.280 --> 03:11:08.280]  and such do you think you may be able
[03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:10.280]  to spot a fake
[03:11:10.280 --> 03:11:12.280]  but when you think it's a fake
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:14.280]  it may be real
[03:11:14.280 --> 03:11:16.280]  Pennsylvania still
[03:11:16.280 --> 03:11:18.280]  can't account for 700 pounds of
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:20.280]  demolition is great explosive
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:22.280]  400 blasting caps that were stolen
[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:24.280]  out of Lancaster County
[03:11:24.280 --> 03:11:26.280]  so
[03:11:26.280 --> 03:11:28.280]  yes this was
[03:11:28.280 --> 03:11:30.280]  looks like a training device
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:32.280]  that
[03:11:32.280 --> 03:11:34.280]  is fake as a
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:36.280]  $3 bill
[03:11:36.280 --> 03:11:38.280]  and so that shows it wasn't a lone
[03:11:38.280 --> 03:11:40.280]  cook that didn't know what he was doing
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:42.280]  building it it came from people involved
[03:11:42.280 --> 03:11:44.280]  in the system God bless you I appreciate
[03:11:44.280 --> 03:11:46.280]  your call
[03:11:46.280 --> 03:11:48.280]  really really great points from these callers here
[03:11:48.280 --> 03:11:50.280]  and it's the timing it's the pre-programming
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:52.280]  that Trump's violent Alex Jones
[03:11:52.280 --> 03:11:54.280]  is violent we're going to get the media killed
[03:11:54.280 --> 03:11:56.280]  that's your biggest tell because we weren't
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:11:58.280]  doing that and they were saying on every
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:00.280]  channel to get you ready for this point
[03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:02.280]  to get you ready for this point
[03:12:02.280 --> 03:12:04.280]  that's why you know it's fake
[03:12:04.280 --> 03:12:06.280]  then everything else is just gravy from
[03:12:06.280 --> 03:12:08.280]  that point on it's ridiculous how fake
[03:12:08.280 --> 03:12:10.280]  it is okay who's been
[03:12:10.280 --> 03:12:12.280]  holding the longest now Matt no no
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:14.280]  Garrett in Pennsylvania then Matt
[03:12:14.280 --> 03:12:16.280]  Garrett thanks for holding powder Nick
[03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:18.280]  Beggars is coming up
[03:12:18.280 --> 03:12:20.280]  all right Alex I just wanted to
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:22.280]  thank you guys for all that you're doing on
[03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:24.280]  info wars and commend you for everything
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:26.280]  you guys are doing in the fight against globalization
[03:12:26.280 --> 03:12:28.280]  I wanted to talk
[03:12:28.280 --> 03:12:30.280]  today about two different things I wanted
[03:12:30.280 --> 03:12:32.280]  to talk about how this is
[03:12:32.280 --> 03:12:34.280]  obviously way too good to be true you guys know
[03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:36.280]  that and and how society
[03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:38.280]  has become extremely numb to all
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:40.280]  these negative
[03:12:40.280 --> 03:12:42.280]  negative things that were force-fed with a
[03:12:42.280 --> 03:12:44.280]  fire hose every single day by
[03:12:44.280 --> 03:12:46.280]  the mainstream media obviously it's too good to
[03:12:46.280 --> 03:12:48.280]  be true you guys have been saying it for the last
[03:12:48.280 --> 03:12:50.280]  three days
[03:12:50.280 --> 03:12:52.280]  I see this happening
[03:12:52.280 --> 03:12:54.280]  more and more at times
[03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:56.280]  go on but people are becoming numb
[03:12:56.280 --> 03:12:58.280]  and number and number to it
[03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:00.280]  I'm a college student and I went to class
[03:13:00.280 --> 03:13:02.280]  a couple days ago and one of our
[03:13:02.280 --> 03:13:04.280]  professors said what happened today
[03:13:04.280 --> 03:13:06.280]  and then someone said oh there were
[03:13:06.280 --> 03:13:08.280]  bomb threats to all these high-level
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:10.280]  individuals well the high-level
[03:13:10.280 --> 03:13:12.280]  individuals were never affected and
[03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:14.280]  no one died and no one was injured
[03:13:14.280 --> 03:13:16.280]  so what ended up happening
[03:13:16.280 --> 03:13:18.280]  was
[03:13:18.280 --> 03:13:20.280]  nobody in class commented he's like would anyone
[03:13:20.280 --> 03:13:22.280]  like to give their opinion and not a single
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:24.280]  individual said that they
[03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:26.280]  were interested in giving their opinion
[03:13:26.280 --> 03:13:28.280]  because everyone's so numb to hearing
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:30.280]  all of the negative
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:32.280]  that comes out of the media
[03:13:34.280 --> 03:13:36.280]  and again the bombs weren't even
[03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:38.280]  bombs they were fake
[03:13:38.280 --> 03:13:40.280]  right it all it is
[03:13:40.280 --> 03:13:42.280]  it's a giant
[03:13:42.280 --> 03:13:44.280]  it's a giant hoax for people
[03:13:44.280 --> 03:13:46.280]  to believe that there's something negative
[03:13:46.280 --> 03:13:48.280]  that's going to happen now I believe that the worst
[03:13:48.280 --> 03:13:50.280]  thing that could happen is that they go
[03:13:50.280 --> 03:13:52.280]  to one of the major polling sites and
[03:13:52.280 --> 03:13:54.280]  actually touch a bomb off and kill
[03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:56.280]  or maim a lot of people
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:13:58.280]  or send someone who's extremely
[03:13:58.280 --> 03:14:00.280]  crazy and to actually
[03:14:00.280 --> 03:14:02.280]  shoot up one of these polling stations
[03:14:02.280 --> 03:14:04.280]  I'm telling you we're 11 days
[03:14:04.280 --> 03:14:06.280]  out and I just
[03:14:06.280 --> 03:14:08.280]  pray to get through this election because
[03:14:08.280 --> 03:14:10.280]  you just know they're not going to stop
[03:14:10.280 --> 03:14:12.280]  and I think this is a test to see
[03:14:12.280 --> 03:14:14.280]  how people buy it
[03:14:14.280 --> 03:14:16.280]  thank you so much Garrett all right we got Jeff
[03:14:16.280 --> 03:14:18.280]  Matt and Tommy on the line but you know
[03:14:18.280 --> 03:14:20.280]  Dr. Nick Baggage is an amazing guy
[03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:22.280]  he's got a full slate of things to cover and I said
[03:14:22.280 --> 03:14:24.280]  I'd get to every call an hour ago but those were
[03:14:24.280 --> 03:14:26.280]  new calls that got on early except
[03:14:26.280 --> 03:14:28.280]  for Matt
[03:14:28.280 --> 03:14:30.280]  now I'm going to go live tomorrow at 3pm
[03:14:30.280 --> 03:14:32.280]  at infowars.com
[03:14:32.280 --> 03:14:34.280]  or put out on the satellite as well
[03:14:34.280 --> 03:14:36.280]  so 3pm tomorrow central you can tune in but
[03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:38.280]  if Matt we get match number
[03:14:38.280 --> 03:14:40.280]  I'll call Matt back tomorrow Tommy and Jeff
[03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:42.280]  I know they don't care about this but all of them
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:44.280]  get a free t-shirt get their address get their name
[03:14:44.280 --> 03:14:46.280]  ask what they want and we'll send it to them
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:48.280]  a free t-shirt if we're holding so I promise
[03:14:48.280 --> 03:14:50.280]  to get to everybody but it's just impossible
[03:14:50.280 --> 03:14:52.280]  and I'm not going to take the rest of Dr. Nick
[03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:54.280]  Baggage research or sciences brother
[03:14:54.280 --> 03:14:56.280]  for some former US senator said to
[03:14:56.280 --> 03:14:58.280]  be the next governor and his dad famous congressman
[03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:00.280]  really smart scientists has exposed
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:02.280]  all the big brother systems and more
[03:15:02.280 --> 03:15:04.280]  he's going to be coming on to give his
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:06.280]  respective on all of this and then in about
[03:15:06.280 --> 03:15:08.280]  45 minutes we're going to have the war room
[03:15:08.280 --> 03:15:10.280]  with Owen shroyer myself

[03:17:22.280 --> 03:17:24.280]  hi I'm Dan Pilla
[03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:26.280]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years
[03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:28.280]  ago when they tried to seize my mother's house
[03:17:28.280 --> 03:17:30.280]  I sued the IRS in one I beat the IRS then
[03:17:30.280 --> 03:17:32.280]  and I've been beating them ever since
[03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:34.280]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[03:17:34.280 --> 03:17:36.280]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with
[03:17:36.280 --> 03:17:38.280]  tax problems they thought might never be solved
[03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:40.280]  I can help you too if you owe taxes
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:42.280]  you can't pay don't wait another day
[03:17:42.280 --> 03:17:44.280]  there's no such thing as a hopeless tax case
[03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:46.280]  call 834 no tax
[03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:48.280]  or go to my website
[03:17:48.280 --> 03:17:50.280]  danpilla.com that's danpilla.com
[03:17:50.280 --> 03:18:16.280]  living in volcano may sound more
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:20.280]  we've employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:18:20.280 --> 03:18:22.280]  alkalinity and pH what we learned
[03:18:22.280 --> 03:18:24.280]  was that there was in fact unhealthy levels
[03:18:24.280 --> 03:18:26.280]  of heavy metals and acidity in the rain water
[03:18:26.280 --> 03:18:28.280]  next we tested the water
[03:18:28.280 --> 03:18:30.280]  from our Alexa pure gravity filter
[03:18:30.280 --> 03:18:32.280]  and not only were the heavy metal levels
[03:18:32.280 --> 03:18:34.280]  within safe measure
[03:18:34.280 --> 03:18:36.280]  but the pH was also restored
[03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:38.280]  to optimal levels as it turns
[03:18:38.280 --> 03:18:40.280]  out the filter on the Alexa pure
[03:18:40.280 --> 03:18:42.280]  raises the pH of the water
[03:18:42.280 --> 03:18:44.280]  so what we've learned is that
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:46.280]  volcanic ash and acid rain
[03:18:46.280 --> 03:18:48.280]  can contaminate a rain water supply
[03:18:48.280 --> 03:18:50.280]  but more importantly
[03:18:50.280 --> 03:18:52.280]  a good water filtration system
[03:18:52.280 --> 03:18:54.280]  will purify it
[03:18:54.280 --> 03:18:56.280]  in full wars life is launching its newest
[03:18:56.280 --> 03:18:58.280]  product we're really really proud of it
[03:18:58.280 --> 03:19:00.280]  it's a best source
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:02.280]  prebiotic fiber
[03:19:02.280 --> 03:19:04.280]  and it's got the very best
[03:19:04.280 --> 03:19:06.280]  concentrated fibers
[03:19:06.280 --> 03:19:08.280]  from berries and fruits
[03:19:08.280 --> 03:19:10.280]  and other compounds that have been known
[03:19:10.280 --> 03:19:12.280]  to be the very best for your body
[03:19:12.280 --> 03:19:14.280]  and for regularity and so much more

[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:22.280]  that targets the yeast, the mold
[03:19:22.280 --> 03:19:24.280]  and the funguses in the gut
[03:19:24.280 --> 03:19:26.280]  so this is the time to take advantage
[03:19:26.280 --> 03:19:28.280]  of getting this new incredible fiber product

[03:19:32.280 --> 03:19:34.280]  and make really really big savings
[03:19:34.280 --> 03:19:36.280]  and get high quality products at the same time
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:38.280]  and I'm doing this to introduce these products to you
[03:19:38.280 --> 03:19:40.280]  bodies sold out in a month
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:42.280]  a strongest concentrated turmeric
[03:19:42.280 --> 03:19:44.280]  formula we can come up with
[03:19:44.280 --> 03:19:46.280]  it's sold out for another month and a half
[03:19:46.280 --> 03:19:48.280]  we sold it at 50% off
[03:19:48.280 --> 03:19:50.280]  till it's sold out
[03:19:50.280 --> 03:19:52.280]  and I think it's going to be the same way with this fiber
[03:19:52.280 --> 03:20:18.280]  today in foreslife.com
[03:20:18.280 --> 03:20:24.280]  and welcome back to
[03:20:24.280 --> 03:20:26.280]  and I'm standing in for the last hour
[03:20:26.280 --> 03:20:28.280]  of today's broadcast
[03:20:28.280 --> 03:20:30.280]  and what a week
[03:20:30.280 --> 03:20:32.280]  you know I mean come on
[03:20:32.280 --> 03:20:34.280]  really the fake bombs
[03:20:34.280 --> 03:20:36.280]  the whole movement
[03:20:36.280 --> 03:20:38.280]  on the midterms
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:40.280]  this is probably the most
[03:20:40.280 --> 03:20:42.280]  important midterm
[03:20:42.280 --> 03:20:44.280]  in the last 50 years
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:46.280]  if you think about what's happening
[03:20:46.280 --> 03:20:48.280]  right now
[03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:50.280]  in terms of mainstream media
[03:20:50.280 --> 03:20:52.280]  and what's been happening
[03:20:52.280 --> 03:20:54.280]  and shutting down the voice
[03:20:54.280 --> 03:20:56.280]  of conservatives
[03:20:56.280 --> 03:20:58.280]  throughout the country
[03:20:58.280 --> 03:21:00.280]  in fact as really
[03:21:00.280 --> 03:21:02.280]  a globalist attack on the idea
[03:21:02.280 --> 03:21:04.280]  that nationalism matters
[03:21:04.280 --> 03:21:06.280]  and I think it does
[03:21:06.280 --> 03:21:08.280]  you know I'm glad to hear
[03:21:08.280 --> 03:21:10.280]  somebody in the oval
[03:21:10.280 --> 03:21:12.280]  office standing up
[03:21:12.280 --> 03:21:14.280]  for the first time in a very long time
[03:21:14.280 --> 03:21:16.280]  with the suggestion that
[03:21:16.280 --> 03:21:18.280]  having your national interest
[03:21:18.280 --> 03:21:20.280]  as a priority
[03:21:20.280 --> 03:21:22.280]  is what the executive
[03:21:22.280 --> 03:21:24.280]  is supposed to be about
[03:21:24.280 --> 03:21:26.280]  it's not about globalism
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:28.280]  sure it's about sharing information
[03:21:28.280 --> 03:21:30.280]  cooperating where you share values
[03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:32.280]  and common interests
[03:21:32.280 --> 03:21:34.280]  but it's not
[03:21:34.280 --> 03:21:36.280]  the way it's been running
[03:21:36.280 --> 03:21:38.280]  and certainly America was never intended
[03:21:38.280 --> 03:21:40.280]  to be the policeman
[03:21:40.280 --> 03:21:42.280]  of the world
[03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:44.280]  the way
[03:21:44.280 --> 03:21:46.280]  on the opposite side
[03:21:46.280 --> 03:21:48.280]  of the agenda
[03:21:48.280 --> 03:21:50.280]  when you think about globalism
[03:21:50.280 --> 03:21:52.280]  here in my part of the United States
[03:21:52.280 --> 03:21:54.280]  in Alaska
[03:21:54.280 --> 03:21:56.280]  this is a major issue
[03:21:56.280 --> 03:21:58.280]  think about where Alaska sits today
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:00.280]  we're at the top of the world
[03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:02.280]  we cover the northern hemisphere so
[03:22:02.280 --> 03:22:04.280]  easily in terms of our strategic
[03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:06.280]  position UPS FedEx
[03:22:06.280 --> 03:22:08.280]  based their international hubs here
[03:22:08.280 --> 03:22:10.280]  because it's about equal distance
[03:22:10.280 --> 03:22:12.280]  the globe
[03:22:12.280 --> 03:22:14.280]  into the entire northern hemisphere
[03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:16.280]  of the planet
[03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:18.280]  when you look at strategic bases
[03:22:18.280 --> 03:22:20.280]  in Alaska
[03:22:20.280 --> 03:22:22.280]  there's another reason Alaska is critically important
[03:22:22.280 --> 03:22:24.280]  to the defense of all of the northern hemisphere
[03:22:24.280 --> 03:22:26.280]  when you think of Europe
[03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:28.280]  we don't need to be
[03:22:28.280 --> 03:22:30.280]  based in Europe anymore
[03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:32.280]  when you think about
[03:22:32.280 --> 03:22:34.280]  where America can reach the world
[03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:36.280]  I mean in terms of our strategic
[03:22:36.280 --> 03:22:38.280]  bases we have Guam
[03:22:38.280 --> 03:22:40.280]  on the other side of the Pacific
[03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:42.280]  gives us access to Asia
[03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:44.280]  we have Hawaii in the middle Pacific
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:46.280]  gives us access to everything
[03:22:46.280 --> 03:22:48.280]  within the Pacific region
[03:22:48.280 --> 03:22:50.280]  if you look on the screen right now
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:52.280]  are some of the major military bases
[03:22:52.280 --> 03:22:54.280]  in Alaska and these don't include
[03:22:54.280 --> 03:22:56.280]  a number of stations
[03:22:56.280 --> 03:22:58.280]  listing posts and other posts
[03:22:58.280 --> 03:23:00.280]  scattered around the state
[03:23:00.280 --> 03:23:02.280]  when you think about
[03:23:02.280 --> 03:23:04.280]  strategic positioning
[03:23:04.280 --> 03:23:06.280]  in the world
[03:23:06.280 --> 03:23:08.280]  in the Atlantic
[03:23:08.280 --> 03:23:10.280]  it takes us out quite a ways
[03:23:10.280 --> 03:23:12.280]  when we look at Puerto Rico
[03:23:12.280 --> 03:23:14.280]  Florida, these places that hit us
[03:23:14.280 --> 03:23:16.280]  into the southern hemisphere
[03:23:16.280 --> 03:23:18.280]  we can be virtually anywhere
[03:23:18.280 --> 03:23:20.280]  within 10 or 12 hours
[03:23:20.280 --> 03:23:22.280]  aside from the police we have stationed
[03:23:22.280 --> 03:23:24.280]  around the world a rethink
[03:23:24.280 --> 03:23:26.280]  of all of this is what's underway
[03:23:26.280 --> 03:23:28.280]  right now and because
[03:23:28.280 --> 03:23:30.280]  of all this bomb discussion
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:32.280]  there are also some major issues being missed
[03:23:32.280 --> 03:23:34.280]  that I want to cover
[03:23:34.280 --> 03:23:36.280]  in this segment have nothing to do
[03:23:36.280 --> 03:23:38.280]  with terrorism have nothing to do with bombing
[03:23:38.280 --> 03:23:40.280]  but has everything to do with things that actually
[03:23:40.280 --> 03:23:42.280]  affect us every single day
[03:23:42.280 --> 03:23:44.280]  but I want to get back in
[03:23:44.280 --> 03:23:46.280]  into the midterms as we look
[03:23:46.280 --> 03:23:48.280]  at what's shaping up
[03:23:48.280 --> 03:23:50.280]  as the most important
[03:23:50.280 --> 03:23:52.280]  election of our history
[03:23:52.280 --> 03:23:54.280]  and I would not trust these polls
[03:23:54.280 --> 03:23:56.280]  I mean remember when Trump
[03:23:56.280 --> 03:23:58.280]  was winning and the polls were saying
[03:23:58.280 --> 03:24:00.280]  he's 12 points behind
[03:24:00.280 --> 03:24:02.280]  he's 10 points behind
[03:24:02.280 --> 03:24:04.280]  that
[03:24:04.280 --> 03:24:06.280]  the polls are not accurate anymore
[03:24:06.280 --> 03:24:08.280]  and the reason they're not accurate
[03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:10.280]  is too many people are not participating
[03:24:10.280 --> 03:24:12.280]  are not feeding the polling system
[03:24:12.280 --> 03:24:14.280]  they just hang up
[03:24:14.280 --> 03:24:16.280]  people are burned out at being called all the time
[03:24:16.280 --> 03:24:18.280]  early polling
[03:24:18.280 --> 03:24:20.280]  is predominantly
[03:24:20.280 --> 03:24:22.280]  Republican
[03:24:22.280 --> 03:24:24.280]  I think this is a tell-tale sign
[03:24:24.280 --> 03:24:26.280]  of what's happening the effort of the left
[03:24:26.280 --> 03:24:28.280]  is backfiring the desperation
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:30.280]  of the left is showing itself
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:32.280]  and the fact of the matter is
[03:24:32.280 --> 03:24:34.280]  we need to maintain the
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:36.280]  majorities that are in the Congress
[03:24:36.280 --> 03:24:38.280]  right now if we're going to see anything
[03:24:38.280 --> 03:24:40.280]  happen we saw eight years of
[03:24:40.280 --> 03:24:42.280]  gridlock under Obama virtually nothing
[03:24:42.280 --> 03:24:44.280]  happened after the first couple years
[03:24:44.280 --> 03:24:46.280]  and then it was a fight for the next six
[03:24:46.280 --> 03:24:48.280]  we've made it
[03:24:48.280 --> 03:24:50.280]  through the first two years of the Trump administration
[03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:52.280]  successfully we've got the lowest
[03:24:52.280 --> 03:24:54.280]  unemployment in 50 years
[03:24:54.280 --> 03:24:56.280]  we have the highest stock market
[03:24:56.280 --> 03:24:58.280]  and I want to talk a little bit about the market
[03:24:58.280 --> 03:25:00.280]  as we go through the segments today
[03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:02.280]  but the main thing to remember here
[03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:04.280]  is interest rates are rising
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:06.280]  because of the Federal Reserve
[03:25:06.280 --> 03:25:08.280]  which is not a federal agency as all of these
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:10.280]  listeners know
[03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:12.280]  but the fact is
[03:25:12.280 --> 03:25:14.280]  the Fed is manipulating the economy
[03:25:14.280 --> 03:25:16.280]  and suggesting that there's going to be
[03:25:16.280 --> 03:25:18.280]  four to five more rate hikes over the next
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:20.280]  15-18 months
[03:25:20.280 --> 03:25:22.280]  what's that going to do to the economy
[03:25:22.280 --> 03:25:24.280]  it's going to stop it in its tracks
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:26.280]  think about what happens
[03:25:26.280 --> 03:25:28.280]  to the national debt as they increment
[03:25:28.280 --> 03:25:30.280]  up these interest rates and a bigger
[03:25:30.280 --> 03:25:32.280]  and bigger portion of the debt
[03:25:32.280 --> 03:25:34.280]  that the Democrats ran up over the last
[03:25:34.280 --> 03:25:36.280]  eight years doubling
[03:25:36.280 --> 03:25:38.280]  maybe even tripling the national
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:40.280]  obligations going forward
[03:25:40.280 --> 03:25:42.280]  to increase the interest on this
[03:25:42.280 --> 03:25:44.280]  now is going to just
[03:25:44.280 --> 03:25:46.280]  crush the drive that's
[03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:48.280]  happening right now to build this economy
[03:25:48.280 --> 03:25:50.280]  we can't let the Federal Reserve
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:52.280]  continue to manipulate
[03:25:52.280 --> 03:25:54.280]  under the fear of inflation
[03:25:54.280 --> 03:25:56.280]  there isn't really any inflation
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:25:58.280]  going on it's so counter
[03:25:58.280 --> 03:26:00.280]  to logic and where
[03:26:00.280 --> 03:26:02.280]  inflation is happening is in
[03:26:02.280 --> 03:26:04.280]  wages a little bit
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:06.280]  and long, long overdue
[03:26:06.280 --> 03:26:08.280]  the average wage is
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:10.280]  against inflation even the small
[03:26:10.280 --> 03:26:12.280]  inflation we have have been deteriorating
[03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:14.280]  over the last 15 years
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:16.280]  it used to be
[03:26:16.280 --> 03:26:18.280]  one person in a household could support
[03:26:18.280 --> 03:26:20.280]  the entire household now
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:22.280]  two people in the household are barely
[03:26:22.280 --> 03:26:24.280]  thinking at work in full time
[03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:26.280]  the situation has changed
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:28.280]  there's a lot of money have been made
[03:26:28.280 --> 03:26:30.280]  corporately in the last couple years
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:32.280]  because of the reforms of the Trump
[03:26:32.280 --> 03:26:34.280]  administration and now we're starting to see
[03:26:34.280 --> 03:26:36.280]  those move down
[03:26:36.280 --> 03:26:38.280]  towards the workforce, towards working
[03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:40.280]  people which actually
[03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:42.280]  the Republicans are representing better
[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:44.280]  than the Democrats these days
[03:26:44.280 --> 03:26:46.280]  I mean think about it at least
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:48.280]  we're looking at
[03:26:48.280 --> 03:26:50.280]  enhancing opportunities for people that
[03:26:50.280 --> 03:26:52.280]  are in the country and a chance
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:54.280]  to boost the workforce
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:56.280]  not invite more low
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:26:58.280]  wage earners in
[03:26:58.280 --> 03:27:00.280]  we have a chance to build something
[03:27:00.280 --> 03:27:02.280]  and the forgotten man
[03:27:02.280 --> 03:27:04.280]  is the average man and woman
[03:27:04.280 --> 03:27:06.280]  in the country right now
[03:27:06.280 --> 03:27:08.280]  the market because
[03:27:08.280 --> 03:27:10.280]  interest rates are rising money is moving
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:12.280]  into bombs this is the normal
[03:27:12.280 --> 03:27:14.280]  progression you know
[03:27:14.280 --> 03:27:16.280]  when you can find the earned money and stable
[03:27:16.280 --> 03:27:18.280]  investments people with retirements and
[03:27:18.280 --> 03:27:20.280]  that more reliable sort of
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:22.280]  fixed without the variable
[03:27:22.280 --> 03:27:24.280]  and fluctuations of
[03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:26.280]  markets
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:28.280]  they go for bonds but when bonds aren't yielding
[03:27:28.280 --> 03:27:30.280]  anything one one and a half percent
[03:27:30.280 --> 03:27:32.280]  you just can't do it
[03:27:32.280 --> 03:27:34.280]  so now you're seeing interest rates rise
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:36.280]  people are moving into bonds the market
[03:27:36.280 --> 03:27:38.280]  is going to take a dive because of that
[03:27:38.280 --> 03:27:40.280]  that's a normal progression
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:42.280]  and the Fed is driving that market
[03:27:42.280 --> 03:27:44.280]  collapse by making of course bonds
[03:27:44.280 --> 03:27:46.280]  more attractive to the investment
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:48.280]  community especially to the huge
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:50.280]  investment pools the big
[03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:52.280]  retirement funds the groups moving
[03:27:52.280 --> 03:27:54.280]  huge blocks of money
[03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:56.280]  across the map and it's kind
[03:27:56.280 --> 03:27:58.280]  of interesting to see so much
[03:27:58.280 --> 03:28:00.280]  happening just a few days
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:02.280]  before the most important midterms
[03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:04.280]  in our recent
[03:28:04.280 --> 03:28:06.280]  history now what can happen
[03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:08.280]  if the republicans
[03:28:08.280 --> 03:28:10.280]  maintain their power in the house
[03:28:10.280 --> 03:28:12.280]  and in the senate
[03:28:12.280 --> 03:28:14.280]  what I think we'll see is the
[03:28:14.280 --> 03:28:16.280]  permanent
[03:28:16.280 --> 03:28:18.280]  fix on income taxes
[03:28:18.280 --> 03:28:20.280]  for middle income earners I believe Trump will follow
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:22.280]  through on that promise as he has
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:24.280]  attempted to follow through on every one of his
[03:28:24.280 --> 03:28:26.280]  promises in fact of all the
[03:28:26.280 --> 03:28:28.280]  politicians in recent history
[03:28:28.280 --> 03:28:30.280]  who's hit the meter more
[03:28:30.280 --> 03:28:32.280]  than Donald Trump
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:34.280]  and yet the amount of backlash
[03:28:34.280 --> 03:28:36.280]  from the left is crazy
[03:28:36.280 --> 03:28:38.280]  right now and I think most people
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:40.280]  most people who are independently minded are seeing
[03:28:40.280 --> 03:28:42.280]  the truth of it

[03:33:26.280 --> 03:33:28.280]  on this friday
[03:33:28.280 --> 03:33:30.280]  crawling up to the election
[03:33:30.280 --> 03:33:32.280]  just in about 11-12 days
[03:33:32.280 --> 03:33:34.280]  i mean we're going to be there
[03:33:34.280 --> 03:33:36.280]  and a lot is going to be decided
[03:33:36.280 --> 03:33:38.280]  you know with all the bomb dialogue
[03:33:38.280 --> 03:33:40.280]  there was a really really important
[03:33:40.280 --> 03:33:42.280]  story missed yesterday
[03:33:42.280 --> 03:33:44.280]  and i don't want us to miss it
[03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:46.280]  on infowars
[03:33:46.280 --> 03:33:48.280]  and it was president
[03:33:48.280 --> 03:33:50.280]  trump talking about the pharmaceutical industry
[03:33:50.280 --> 03:33:52.280]  and for those that were listening
[03:33:52.280 --> 03:33:54.280]  a couple of months ago
[03:33:54.280 --> 03:33:56.280]  i was talking about
[03:33:56.280 --> 03:33:58.280]  sort of the fallacy
[03:33:58.280 --> 03:34:00.280]  in what's happening in medicine
[03:34:00.280 --> 03:34:02.280]  within the united states
[03:34:02.280 --> 03:34:04.280]  and what's really driving so much of the cost
[03:34:04.280 --> 03:34:06.280]  and pharma
[03:34:06.280 --> 03:34:08.280]  is the big dent
[03:34:08.280 --> 03:34:10.280]  and there were a couple of things
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:12.280]  that have been dealt with recently
[03:34:12.280 --> 03:34:14.280]  the opioid crisis
[03:34:14.280 --> 03:34:16.280]  obviously has been addressed
[03:34:16.280 --> 03:34:18.280]  by the trump administration aggressively
[03:34:18.280 --> 03:34:20.280]  being addressed
[03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:22.280]  but more importantly
[03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:24.280]  he started talking yesterday
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:26.280]  about a reset
[03:34:26.280 --> 03:34:28.280]  on international
[03:34:28.280 --> 03:34:30.280]  drug prices
[03:34:30.280 --> 03:34:32.280]  in terms of what's going on there
[03:34:32.280 --> 03:34:34.280]  and what he said was that's so important
[03:34:34.280 --> 03:34:36.280]  and i talked about this a couple of months ago
[03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:38.280]  was the idea that
[03:34:38.280 --> 03:34:40.280]  first of all medicare and medicaid
[03:34:40.280 --> 03:34:42.280]  biggest consumers of prescription drugs
[03:34:42.280 --> 03:34:44.280]  until recently never even negotiated
[03:34:44.280 --> 03:34:46.280]  prices
[03:34:46.280 --> 03:34:48.280]  they just took the prices
[03:34:48.280 --> 03:34:50.280]  i mean can you believe it
[03:34:50.280 --> 03:34:52.280]  i mean medicine
[03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:54.280]  medical care in the united states
[03:34:54.280 --> 03:34:56.280]  about 60% of the cost
[03:34:56.280 --> 03:34:58.280]  is pharma
[03:34:58.280 --> 03:35:00.280]  not surgeries, not mds
[03:35:00.280 --> 03:35:02.280]  not hospitals
[03:35:02.280 --> 03:35:04.280]  pharma, pharmaceuticals
[03:35:04.280 --> 03:35:06.280]  this is 60% of the medical cost
[03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:08.280]  40%
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:10.280]  of that pharma cost is advertising
[03:35:10.280 --> 03:35:12.280]  what you see in tv
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:14.280]  on radio
[03:35:14.280 --> 03:35:16.280]  talking about all these drugs
[03:35:16.280 --> 03:35:18.280]  that you can't even buy
[03:35:18.280 --> 03:35:20.280]  as a consumer
[03:35:20.280 --> 03:35:22.280]  without a prescription
[03:35:22.280 --> 03:35:24.280]  so they're advertising people that can't even make the decision
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:26.280]  now
[03:35:26.280 --> 03:35:28.280]  if you say drug companies
[03:35:28.280 --> 03:35:30.280]  can't advertise because it's too big
[03:35:30.280 --> 03:35:32.280]  of an impact on drug prices
[03:35:32.280 --> 03:35:34.280]  that's unconstitutional
[03:35:34.280 --> 03:35:36.280]  you recognize free speech
[03:35:36.280 --> 03:35:38.280]  the ability to advertise
[03:35:38.280 --> 03:35:40.280]  what is constitutional
[03:35:40.280 --> 03:35:42.280]  is you can't limit speech
[03:35:42.280 --> 03:35:44.280]  and i don't think you should anymore than people are limiting alex jones
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:46.280]  which i think is the biggest
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:48.280]  travesty to free speech
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:50.280]  in recent history as well
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:35:52.280]  but what you can do
[03:35:52.280 --> 03:35:54.280]  with the pharmaceutical industry
[03:35:54.280 --> 03:35:56.280]  is you can eliminate the deductibility
[03:35:56.280 --> 03:35:58.280]  for tax purposes
[03:35:58.280 --> 03:36:00.280]  of advertising prescription drugs
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:02.280]  period
[03:36:02.280 --> 03:36:04.280]  just eliminate the line item
[03:36:04.280 --> 03:36:06.280]  so now it has to come out of drug companies
[03:36:06.280 --> 03:36:08.280]  bottom line profits
[03:36:08.280 --> 03:36:10.280]  right off
[03:36:10.280 --> 03:36:12.280]  and let's see how shareholders react to that
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:14.280]  that'll reduce prescription
[03:36:14.280 --> 03:36:16.280]  drug costs more than any single effort
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:18.280]  the united states can do
[03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:20.280]  now what trump said is
[03:36:20.280 --> 03:36:22.280]  that the price medicare and medicaid
[03:36:22.280 --> 03:36:24.280]  should be paying is the international
[03:36:24.280 --> 03:36:26.280]  price of these drugs
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:28.280]  which oftentimes is several
[03:36:28.280 --> 03:36:30.280]  times cheaper
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:32.280]  than in the u.s. this is why people
[03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:34.280]  kept running to mexico and running to canada
[03:36:34.280 --> 03:36:36.280]  to get prescription drugs they couldn't even afford
[03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:38.280]  the united states
[03:36:38.280 --> 03:36:40.280]  this is something i spoke about before
[03:36:40.280 --> 03:36:42.280]  limit the drug prices
[03:36:42.280 --> 03:36:44.280]  in the united states
[03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:46.280]  to the same as the lowest price
[03:36:46.280 --> 03:36:48.280]  offered of those american made drugs
[03:36:48.280 --> 03:36:50.280]  anywhere else in the world
[03:36:50.280 --> 03:36:52.280]  and they have to be offered at the same price
[03:36:52.280 --> 03:36:54.280]  here
[03:36:54.280 --> 03:36:56.280]  you can call it price fixing
[03:36:56.280 --> 03:36:58.280]  you can call it whatever you want
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:00.280]  what i call it is price gouging
[03:37:00.280 --> 03:37:02.280]  of our economy
[03:37:02.280 --> 03:37:04.280]  20% of our economy is medical
[03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:06.280]  a big chunk of that is pharmaceutical
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:08.280]  and this is the
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:10.280]  bleeding of america again
[03:37:10.280 --> 03:37:12.280]  to support a lower drug
[03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:14.280]  price for the rest of the world
[03:37:14.280 --> 03:37:16.280]  we're subsidizing this too
[03:37:16.280 --> 03:37:18.280]  i am so proud of the fact
[03:37:18.280 --> 03:37:20.280]  that finally
[03:37:20.280 --> 03:37:22.280]  someone has stood up to the pharmaceutical industry
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:24.280]  in a way that's put them on notice
[03:37:24.280 --> 03:37:26.280]  and you know what they announced yesterday then
[03:37:26.280 --> 03:37:28.280]  at the same time they're going to lower
[03:37:28.280 --> 03:37:30.280]  the price of one of the big statin drugs
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:32.280]  well let me tell you what the latest statistics are
[03:37:32.280 --> 03:37:34.280]  on the pharmaceutical industry
[03:37:34.280 --> 03:37:36.280]  and pricing
[03:37:36.280 --> 03:37:38.280]  96 for every 96 drugs
[03:37:38.280 --> 03:37:40.280]  that go up
[03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:42.280]  one
[03:37:42.280 --> 03:37:44.280]  goes down
[03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:46.280]  now think about this
[03:37:46.280 --> 03:37:48.280]  you know they issue the press releases
[03:37:48.280 --> 03:37:50.280]  they get the big story
[03:37:50.280 --> 03:37:52.280]  oh they're being responsible
[03:37:52.280 --> 03:37:54.280]  no they're not
[03:37:54.280 --> 03:37:56.280]  they're just spending some of their ill gotten
[03:37:56.280 --> 03:37:58.280]  gain on more propaganda
[03:37:58.280 --> 03:38:00.280]  to feed us more
[03:38:00.280 --> 03:38:02.280]  of the stuff they want to call
[03:38:02.280 --> 03:38:04.280]  fertilizer that we know
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:06.280]  is not fertilizer
[03:38:06.280 --> 03:38:08.280]  i mean we can
[03:38:08.280 --> 03:38:10.280]  see bs when we
[03:38:10.280 --> 03:38:12.280]  examine it and great graphics
[03:38:12.280 --> 03:38:14.280]  you know one thing i want to say too
[03:38:14.280 --> 03:38:16.280]  is working with info wars
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:18.280]  dot com the quality
[03:38:18.280 --> 03:38:20.280]  of the production
[03:38:20.280 --> 03:38:22.280]  daria the whole team at info wars
[03:38:22.280 --> 03:38:24.280]  produce quality
[03:38:24.280 --> 03:38:26.280]  that allows us to get these
[03:38:26.280 --> 03:38:28.280]  issues out and no the left
[03:38:28.280 --> 03:38:30.280]  is not going to stop
[03:38:30.280 --> 03:38:32.280]  this out and i would expect
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:34.280]  that as we move through the midterms
[03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:36.280]  get this behind us as the
[03:38:36.280 --> 03:38:38.280]  conservatives continue to hold the house in the senate
[03:38:38.280 --> 03:38:40.280]  then we're going to see
[03:38:40.280 --> 03:38:42.280]  perhaps a launch
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:44.280]  in the other direction against
[03:38:44.280 --> 03:38:46.280]  those that would inhibit free speech
[03:38:46.280 --> 03:38:48.280]  those that would said stand in front
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:50.280]  of this democratic republic's
[03:38:50.280 --> 03:38:52.280]  ability to debate issues
[03:38:52.280 --> 03:38:54.280]  this is gone
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:56.280]  so far out of balance
[03:38:56.280 --> 03:38:58.280]  that it is not
[03:38:58.280 --> 03:39:00.280]  representative of the republic
[03:39:00.280 --> 03:39:02.280]  that most of us
[03:39:02.280 --> 03:39:04.280]  recognize the country to be
[03:39:04.280 --> 03:39:06.280]  the mainstream media has missed
[03:39:06.280 --> 03:39:08.280]  the boat
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:10.280]  the national polling i believe is so
[03:39:10.280 --> 03:39:12.280]  far off the same way they were before
[03:39:12.280 --> 03:39:14.280]  i don't believe you can poll
[03:39:14.280 --> 03:39:16.280]  accurately anymore
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:18.280]  because the way communications are
[03:39:18.280 --> 03:39:20.280]  diverse so much as cell
[03:39:20.280 --> 03:39:22.280]  phones very few hardline
[03:39:22.280 --> 03:39:24.280]  phones the ability to get to
[03:39:24.280 --> 03:39:26.280]  actually registered voters
[03:39:26.280 --> 03:39:28.280]  that are frequent enough to count
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:30.280]  we're not getting those kinds of results
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:32.280]  i think the better results are going to come
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:34.280]  in the exit polls
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:36.280]  and the ultimate poll on election day
[03:39:36.280 --> 03:39:38.280]  vote now
[03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:40.280]  if you believe in this republic
[03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:42.280]  vote now
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:44.280]  don't wait till the last
[03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:46.280]  minute don't wait till something
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:48.280]  might get in the way on election day
[03:39:48.280 --> 03:39:50.280]  take the step
[03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:52.280]  for your democracy for your republic
[03:39:52.280 --> 03:39:54.280]  and get involved in the midterms
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:39:56.280]  in this last 11th hour
[03:39:56.280 --> 03:39:58.280]  here in Alaska
[03:39:58.280 --> 03:40:00.280]  we've got an election
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:02.280]  going on my brothers in the middle of it
[03:40:02.280 --> 03:40:04.280]  he's on the left
[03:40:04.280 --> 03:40:06.280]  and i disagree
[03:40:06.280 --> 03:40:08.280]  with mark on a lot of issues
[03:40:08.280 --> 03:40:10.280]  other issues we're totally together
[03:40:10.280 --> 03:40:12.280]  off social issues
[03:40:12.280 --> 03:40:14.280]  never on the same page
[03:40:14.280 --> 03:40:16.280]  but on economics
[03:40:16.280 --> 03:40:18.280]  often we are
[03:40:18.280 --> 03:40:20.280]  and there's big issues in Alaska
[03:40:20.280 --> 03:40:22.280]  one of the big issues mark is being beat up
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:24.280]  for now is we have a
[03:40:24.280 --> 03:40:26.280]  proposition on
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:28.280]  our ballot that's going to change the way
[03:40:28.280 --> 03:40:30.280]  water
[03:40:30.280 --> 03:40:32.280]  and wastewater is handled with
[03:40:32.280 --> 03:40:34.280]  relative to mining and industry in Alaska
[03:40:34.280 --> 03:40:36.280]  and mark
[03:40:36.280 --> 03:40:38.280]  and i differ on this issue you know i'm in the
[03:40:38.280 --> 03:40:40.280]  mining business you know we have the toughest
[03:40:40.280 --> 03:40:42.280]  environmental laws in the country in Alaska
[03:40:42.280 --> 03:40:44.280]  and the reality is
[03:40:44.280 --> 03:40:46.280]  mark's not going to decide this issue
[03:40:46.280 --> 03:40:48.280]  after the election this is a voter
[03:40:48.280 --> 03:40:50.280]  issue this is what all of us in Alaska
[03:40:50.280 --> 03:40:52.280]  i get to vote on
[03:40:52.280 --> 03:40:54.280]  and in the one major issue i
[03:40:54.280 --> 03:40:56.280]  deviate from my brother in this election cycle
[03:40:56.280 --> 03:40:58.280]  is this one and i say
[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:00.280]  we need to maintain
[03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:02.280]  the status quo vote no on this initiative
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:04.280]  is too complex that buggers up
[03:41:04.280 --> 03:41:06.280]  the whole system that stands in the way
[03:41:06.280 --> 03:41:08.280]  of Alaska's development
[03:41:08.280 --> 03:41:10.280]  which means it stands in the way
[03:41:10.280 --> 03:41:12.280]  of America's development
[03:41:12.280 --> 03:41:14.280]  and one of the things i would say as we
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:16.280]  look again at the midterms
[03:41:16.280 --> 03:41:18.280]  you think about what's going on
[03:41:18.280 --> 03:41:20.280]  Donald Trump is taken
[03:41:20.280 --> 03:41:22.280]  on the pharma that's the next big
[03:41:22.280 --> 03:41:24.280]  challenge medical costs in the country
[03:41:24.280 --> 03:41:26.280]  i believe that's what his administration
[03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:28.280]  is going to turn towards we saw that
[03:41:28.280 --> 03:41:30.280]  slight pivot yesterday being
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:32.280]  blocked out by the national media
[03:41:32.280 --> 03:41:34.280]  in the sense of
[03:41:34.280 --> 03:41:36.280]  being the most important issue of the day
[03:41:36.280 --> 03:41:38.280]  20%
[03:41:38.280 --> 03:41:40.280]  of our economy is
[03:41:40.280 --> 03:41:42.280]  regulated and
[03:41:42.280 --> 03:41:44.280]  involved in medical professions
[03:41:44.280 --> 03:41:46.280]  and when you look at the quality
[03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:48.280]  of care we're rated in the
[03:41:48.280 --> 03:41:50.280]  40th percent 40th
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:52.280]  40th nationally
[03:41:52.280 --> 03:41:54.280]  internationally when you look across the world
[03:41:54.280 --> 03:41:56.280]  we can't even do it right
[03:41:56.280 --> 03:41:58.280]  when you look at
[03:41:58.280 --> 03:42:00.280]  opioids back in
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:02.280]  2016
[03:42:02.280 --> 03:42:04.280]  just before trump came in
[03:42:04.280 --> 03:42:06.280]  they created a situation
[03:42:06.280 --> 03:42:08.280]  where on opioids the DEA
[03:42:08.280 --> 03:42:10.280]  was actually tracking from the factory
[03:42:10.280 --> 03:42:12.280]  to the pharmacy
[03:42:12.280 --> 03:42:14.280]  right tracking and then in West Virginia
[03:42:14.280 --> 03:42:16.280]  they come up with millions
[03:42:16.280 --> 03:42:18.280]  and millions of doses
[03:42:18.280 --> 03:42:20.280]  for a town of a few hundred right
[03:42:20.280 --> 03:42:22.280]  i mean so many everybody would be dead
[03:42:22.280 --> 03:42:24.280]  there and they made it
[03:42:24.280 --> 03:42:26.280]  illegal the congress
[03:42:26.280 --> 03:42:28.280]  for the DEA to use that method

[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:18.280]  to plug my own website
[03:48:18.280 --> 03:48:20.280]  earthpulse.com
[03:48:20.280 --> 03:48:22.280]  e-a-r-t-h-p-u-l-s-e
[03:48:22.280 --> 03:48:24.280]  dot com i'm a volunteer
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:26.280]  standing in on this hour
[03:48:26.280 --> 03:48:28.280]  how i make my living is through
[03:48:28.280 --> 03:48:30.280]  the things i do on my website also
[03:48:30.280 --> 03:48:32.280]  so please take a look there
[03:48:32.280 --> 03:48:34.280]  earthpulse.com i always appreciate it when you do
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:36.280]  under special events
[03:48:36.280 --> 03:48:38.280]  a couple things i want to point out
[03:48:38.280 --> 03:48:40.280]  on the website is
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:42.280]  the most important
[03:48:42.280 --> 03:48:44.280]  segment i ever did with info war
[03:48:44.280 --> 03:48:46.280]  it's called
[03:48:46.280 --> 03:48:48.280]  doctor it's doctor nick baggage how
[03:48:48.280 --> 03:48:50.280]  to break the zombie trance and it's linked
[03:48:50.280 --> 03:48:52.280]  because fortunately a number
[03:48:52.280 --> 03:48:54.280]  of the listeners kept those segments
[03:48:54.280 --> 03:48:56.280]  so they're still available there's still links
[03:48:56.280 --> 03:48:58.280]  available but i really believe
[03:48:58.280 --> 03:49:00.280]  that was the most important segment i ever did
[03:49:00.280 --> 03:49:02.280]  on info wars and
[03:49:02.280 --> 03:49:04.280]  when rob do and i did that
[03:49:04.280 --> 03:49:06.280]  in a park in austin
[03:49:06.280 --> 03:49:08.280]  we had a huge
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:10.280]  response
[03:49:10.280 --> 03:49:12.280]  and it was a different way of seeing
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:14.280]  the politics so i would encourage
[03:49:14.280 --> 03:49:16.280]  you at this 11th hour take a look
[03:49:16.280 --> 03:49:18.280]  at that video again
[03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:20.280]  i considered it again one of the most
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:22.280]  important things i've ever done
[03:49:22.280 --> 03:49:24.280]  in the 25 years that i've been doing
[03:49:24.280 --> 03:49:26.280]  broadcasting and i have been a guest
[03:49:26.280 --> 03:49:28.280]  on over 4,000
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:30.280]  radio broadcasts
[03:49:30.280 --> 03:49:32.280]  and they're a guest or a host
[03:49:32.280 --> 03:49:34.280]  when you look at the history
[03:49:34.280 --> 03:49:36.280]  of where we're at
[03:49:36.280 --> 03:49:38.280]  take a look at the info wars
[03:49:38.280 --> 03:49:40.280]  store dot com our books
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:42.280]  and videos are all there

[03:50:02.280 --> 03:50:04.280]  so it's the same kind of approach
[03:50:04.280 --> 03:50:06.280]  site the sources get the data
[03:50:06.280 --> 03:50:08.280]  reported to the public
[03:50:08.280 --> 03:50:10.280]  and then let the public decide that's what
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:12.280]  the freedom of the press
[03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:14.280]  is supposed to be about
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:16.280]  it's not what we see on CNN anymore
[03:50:16.280 --> 03:50:18.280]  this opinionated nonsense
[03:50:18.280 --> 03:50:20.280]  that's based on nothing
[03:50:20.280 --> 03:50:22.280]  air, rumor
[03:50:22.280 --> 03:50:24.280]  nonsense
[03:50:24.280 --> 03:50:26.280]  it is an important
[03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:28.280]  time in our history
[03:50:28.280 --> 03:50:30.280]  and it's an important time for all of us
[03:50:30.280 --> 03:50:32.280]  again i want to jump back
[03:50:32.280 --> 03:50:34.280]  to a couple of really important
[03:50:34.280 --> 03:50:36.280]  things when you think about
[03:50:36.280 --> 03:50:38.280]  the manipulation of media right now
[03:50:38.280 --> 03:50:40.280]  the shutting down of info wars
[03:50:40.280 --> 03:50:42.280]  just a couple months ago
[03:50:42.280 --> 03:50:44.280]  in terms of the social media outreach
[03:50:44.280 --> 03:50:46.280]  it backfired
[03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:48.280]  it created the opposite reaction
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:50.280]  i think more people are dialing in now
[03:50:50.280 --> 03:50:52.280]  seeking out the information
[03:50:52.280 --> 03:50:54.280]  than ever before
[03:50:54.280 --> 03:50:56.280]  when we think about the midterms
[03:50:56.280 --> 03:50:58.280]  vote now
[03:50:58.280 --> 03:51:00.280]  i want to say it again
[03:51:00.280 --> 03:51:02.280]  vote now get your vote registered
[03:51:02.280 --> 03:51:04.280]  don't miss that day
[03:51:04.280 --> 03:51:06.280]  if you can spend that day driving other people
[03:51:06.280 --> 03:51:08.280]  it holds god bless you
[03:51:08.280 --> 03:51:10.280]  because we need to get
[03:51:10.280 --> 03:51:12.280]  the vote out
[03:51:12.280 --> 03:51:14.280]  and hold the majorities in the house
[03:51:14.280 --> 03:51:16.280]  and the senate now
[03:51:16.280 --> 03:51:18.280]  at this critical juncture in American history
[03:51:18.280 --> 03:51:20.280]  i've been thinking
[03:51:20.280 --> 03:51:22.280]  about how do i go forward
[03:51:22.280 --> 03:51:24.280]  i've got several segments
[03:51:24.280 --> 03:51:26.280]  set up for the last
[03:51:26.280 --> 03:51:28.280]  of the year
[03:51:28.280 --> 03:51:30.280]  and one of the things i've contemplated
[03:51:30.280 --> 03:51:32.280]  is taking some of these basic ideas
[03:51:32.280 --> 03:51:34.280]  we've been covering in the last few months
[03:51:34.280 --> 03:51:36.280]  and reduce them to very
[03:51:36.280 --> 03:51:38.280]  simple
[03:51:38.280 --> 03:51:40.280]  written statements
[03:51:40.280 --> 03:51:42.280]  and because they kind of take a life of their own
[03:51:42.280 --> 03:51:44.280]  radio comes and people forget
[03:51:44.280 --> 03:51:46.280]  when you put it down and writing
[03:51:46.280 --> 03:51:48.280]  it sort of takes on a life of some
[03:51:48.280 --> 03:51:50.280]  people copy that duplicate it
[03:51:50.280 --> 03:51:52.280]  take ideas from it and circulate them
[03:51:52.280 --> 03:51:54.280]  so i'm going to start doing that
[03:51:54.280 --> 03:51:56.280]  i'm going to develop a series of issues
[03:51:56.280 --> 03:51:58.280]  develop the problem
[03:51:58.280 --> 03:52:00.280]  and the solutions as i see them
[03:52:00.280 --> 03:52:02.280]  for some of the issues facing us internationally
[03:52:02.280 --> 03:52:04.280]  and nationally
[03:52:04.280 --> 03:52:06.280]  and i'll give you a couple of examples
[03:52:06.280 --> 03:52:08.280]  of things i've been contemplating
[03:52:08.280 --> 03:52:10.280]  and things i've talked about
[03:52:10.280 --> 03:52:12.280]  in this broadcast before
[03:52:12.280 --> 03:52:14.280]  and let's talk about defense
[03:52:14.280 --> 03:52:16.280]  as a starting point because this is the biggest area
[03:52:16.280 --> 03:52:18.280]  of the national budget
[03:52:18.280 --> 03:52:20.280]  this is the area that creates the most controversy
[03:52:20.280 --> 03:52:22.280]  when we think about international events
[03:52:22.280 --> 03:52:24.280]  and when you look at military spending
[03:52:24.280 --> 03:52:26.280]  in the united states
[03:52:26.280 --> 03:52:28.280]  this is
[03:52:28.280 --> 03:52:30.280]  the biggest
[03:52:30.280 --> 03:52:32.280]  public money that goes out
[03:52:32.280 --> 03:52:34.280]  now there are approximately
[03:52:34.280 --> 03:52:36.280]  800-850 military bases
[03:52:36.280 --> 03:52:38.280]  and stations
[03:52:38.280 --> 03:52:40.280]  scattered around the world
[03:52:40.280 --> 03:52:42.280]  and in one of the earlier segments i was talking
[03:52:42.280 --> 03:52:44.280]  the very first segment of how quick
[03:52:44.280 --> 03:52:46.280]  we can get to anywhere in the world now
[03:52:46.280 --> 03:52:48.280]  we do not need
[03:52:48.280 --> 03:52:50.280]  to maintain
[03:52:50.280 --> 03:52:52.280]  these bases at the level we're maintaining
[03:52:52.280 --> 03:52:54.280]  them now in these foreign
[03:52:54.280 --> 03:52:56.280]  locations where our servicemen
[03:52:56.280 --> 03:52:58.280]  and women are treated hostily
[03:52:58.280 --> 03:53:00.280]  take a look at japan
[03:53:00.280 --> 03:53:02.280]  they don't want us there anymore
[03:53:02.280 --> 03:53:04.280]  take a look at germany a man or a woman
[03:53:04.280 --> 03:53:06.280]  in uniform walk off of a military base
[03:53:06.280 --> 03:53:08.280]  in germany generally they're treated pretty badly
[03:53:08.280 --> 03:53:10.280]  and yet
[03:53:10.280 --> 03:53:12.280]  if we pulled those bases out
[03:53:14.280 --> 03:53:16.280]  they wouldn't even have the resources to stand
[03:53:16.280 --> 03:53:18.280]  in their place now
[03:53:18.280 --> 03:53:20.280]  why do i believe we should start to stage
[03:53:20.280 --> 03:53:22.280]  a return to american soil
[03:53:22.280 --> 03:53:24.280]  of american servicemen and women
[03:53:24.280 --> 03:53:26.280]  because the money spent
[03:53:26.280 --> 03:53:28.280]  in these countries
[03:53:28.280 --> 03:53:30.280]  for their defense
[03:53:30.280 --> 03:53:32.280]  needs to start being paid by them
[03:53:32.280 --> 03:53:34.280]  these are not third world economies
[03:53:34.280 --> 03:53:36.280]  these are first world economies
[03:53:36.280 --> 03:53:38.280]  they've had 70 years since world war 2
[03:53:38.280 --> 03:53:40.280]  to get their act together
[03:53:40.280 --> 03:53:42.280]  and provide for their own defense in its time
[03:53:42.280 --> 03:53:44.280]  and i believe donald trump is absolutely correct
[03:53:44.280 --> 03:53:46.280]  the number he used 90%
[03:53:46.280 --> 03:53:48.280]  of nato cost is incorrect
[03:53:48.280 --> 03:53:50.280]  and i think that's come out
[03:53:50.280 --> 03:53:52.280]  but it's 67%
[03:53:52.280 --> 03:53:54.280]  according to foreign affairs
[03:53:54.280 --> 03:53:56.280]  in this journal
[03:53:56.280 --> 03:53:58.280]  67%
[03:53:58.280 --> 03:54:00.280]  is the real number from their perspective
[03:54:00.280 --> 03:54:02.280]  why is the united states
[03:54:02.280 --> 03:54:04.280]  paying for two thirds of europe's defense
[03:54:04.280 --> 03:54:06.280]  they can afford
[03:54:06.280 --> 03:54:08.280]  their own defense
[03:54:08.280 --> 03:54:10.280]  and donald trump is absolutely correct on this
[03:54:10.280 --> 03:54:12.280]  something i've been saying for years
[03:54:12.280 --> 03:54:14.280]  if you pulled all of those bases
[03:54:14.280 --> 03:54:16.280]  back and all of those
[03:54:16.280 --> 03:54:18.280]  positions back and put that
[03:54:18.280 --> 03:54:20.280]  spending in the continent of the united states
[03:54:20.280 --> 03:54:22.280]  and our territories
[03:54:22.280 --> 03:54:24.280]  we would see the biggest economic boom
[03:54:24.280 --> 03:54:26.280]  in history
[03:54:26.280 --> 03:54:28.280]  it would dwarf what we've seen the last two years
[03:54:28.280 --> 03:54:30.280]  because it's not only
[03:54:30.280 --> 03:54:32.280]  the direct expenditures of the military
[03:54:32.280 --> 03:54:34.280]  it's the three, four, five, six
[03:54:34.280 --> 03:54:36.280]  even seven times
[03:54:36.280 --> 03:54:38.280]  that that money rolls through those local economies
[03:54:38.280 --> 03:54:40.280]  that money could be rolling
[03:54:40.280 --> 03:54:42.280]  through our local economies
[03:54:42.280 --> 03:54:44.280]  providing jobs within
[03:54:44.280 --> 03:54:46.280]  the support sector within the united states
[03:54:46.280 --> 03:54:48.280]  and
[03:54:48.280 --> 03:54:50.280]  actually putting the defense
[03:54:50.280 --> 03:54:52.280]  back at home where it truly belongs
[03:54:52.280 --> 03:54:54.280]  when you start to look at international
[03:54:54.280 --> 03:54:56.280]  interest has been pushed by the globalist
[03:54:56.280 --> 03:54:58.280]  look at the current economy
[03:54:58.280 --> 03:55:00.280]  the current economy
[03:55:00.280 --> 03:55:02.280]  is generating
[03:55:02.280 --> 03:55:04.280]  a huge, huge
[03:55:04.280 --> 03:55:06.280]  amount of money in the corporate
[03:55:06.280 --> 03:55:08.280]  sector and now it's being bled off
[03:55:08.280 --> 03:55:10.280]  by rising interest rates
[03:55:10.280 --> 03:55:12.280]  and the national budget being
[03:55:12.280 --> 03:55:14.280]  bled off by rising interest rates
[03:55:14.280 --> 03:55:16.280]  so again
[03:55:16.280 --> 03:55:18.280]  as a simple solution bring the bases home
[03:55:18.280 --> 03:55:20.280]  start
[03:55:20.280 --> 03:55:22.280]  a phase out, a staged thing
[03:55:22.280 --> 03:55:24.280]  give the europeans and our allies
[03:55:24.280 --> 03:55:26.280]  a legitimate block of time
[03:55:26.280 --> 03:55:28.280]  to come up with their own solutions
[03:55:28.280 --> 03:55:30.280]  but begin a staged return
[03:55:30.280 --> 03:55:32.280]  to the continent
[03:55:32.280 --> 03:55:34.280]  a return to the united states
[03:55:34.280 --> 03:55:36.280]  of our men and women
[03:55:36.280 --> 03:55:38.280]  and then deployed more strategically
[03:55:38.280 --> 03:55:40.280]  for what are truly the republic's interest
[03:55:40.280 --> 03:55:42.280]  not the globalist interest
[03:55:42.280 --> 03:55:44.280]  not multinational interest
[03:55:44.280 --> 03:55:46.280]  but the average americans
[03:55:46.280 --> 03:55:48.280]  this is what the trump administration
[03:55:48.280 --> 03:55:50.280]  is taking on through big pharma
[03:55:50.280 --> 03:55:52.280]  through a reassessment
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:55:54.280]  of sort of where our role is in the world
[03:55:54.280 --> 03:55:56.280]  and by claiming to be a nationalist
[03:55:56.280 --> 03:55:58.280]  and many people screaming that that's wrong
[03:55:58.280 --> 03:56:00.280]  come on this is america
[03:56:00.280 --> 03:56:02.280]  stand up
[03:56:02.280 --> 03:56:04.280]  for the nation that we all reside in
[03:56:04.280 --> 03:56:06.280]  whether you're on the right or on the left
[03:56:06.280 --> 03:56:08.280]  this is our country
[03:56:08.280 --> 03:56:10.280]  we built it
[03:56:10.280 --> 03:56:12.280]  through the controversies of both parties
[03:56:12.280 --> 03:56:14.280]  historically
[03:56:14.280 --> 03:56:16.280]  we have built a nation
[03:56:16.280 --> 03:56:18.280]  that is an example for the world
[03:56:18.280 --> 03:56:20.280]  let's keep it an example, a good example
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:22.280]  and not an example of continued
[03:56:22.280 --> 03:56:24.280]  interference in other people's domestic affairs
[03:56:24.280 --> 03:56:26.280]  we've done too much of it
[03:56:26.280 --> 03:56:28.280]  we've allowed it for too long
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:30.280]  and then the backlash
[03:56:30.280 --> 03:56:32.280]  to our republic
[03:56:32.280 --> 03:56:34.280]  against americans
[03:56:34.280 --> 03:56:36.280]  who don't necessarily line up
[03:56:36.280 --> 03:56:38.280]  with the way our public policy
[03:56:38.280 --> 03:56:40.280]  is projected into the world
[03:56:40.280 --> 03:56:42.280]  i think it is time for a reassessment
[03:56:42.280 --> 03:56:44.280]  that's what america is in the middle of
[03:56:44.280 --> 03:56:46.280]  that's what this election cycle is about
[03:56:46.280 --> 03:56:48.280]  that's what
[03:56:48.280 --> 03:56:50.280]  info wars
[03:56:50.280 --> 03:56:52.280]  has been about
[03:56:52.280 --> 03:56:54.280]  an informed public, a responsible electorate
[03:56:54.280 --> 03:56:56.280]  so that we can go to the polls
[03:56:56.280 --> 03:56:58.280]  and vote
[03:56:58.280 --> 03:57:00.280]  and make a difference
[03:57:00.280 --> 03:57:02.280]  well there's still an opportunity to make a difference
[03:57:02.280 --> 03:57:04.280]  we have two more years
[03:57:04.280 --> 03:57:06.280]  of this existing trump administration
[03:57:06.280 --> 03:57:08.280]  keep the congress that he has
[03:57:08.280 --> 03:57:10.280]  to work with intact
[03:57:10.280 --> 03:57:12.280]  there is plenty of checks
[03:57:12.280 --> 03:57:14.280]  in balances within our system
[03:57:14.280 --> 03:57:16.280]  but it is time
[03:57:16.280 --> 03:57:18.280]  it's time to invigorate the public
[03:57:18.280 --> 03:57:20.280]  it's time to support infowars.com
[03:57:20.280 --> 03:57:22.280]  it's time to get involved
[03:57:22.280 --> 03:57:24.280]  in your political arena
[03:57:24.280 --> 03:57:26.280]  wherever you live in the country
[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:28.280]  step up to the plate, get people to the polls
[03:57:28.280 --> 03:57:30.280]  and vote
[03:57:30.280 --> 03:57:32.280]  this is america and we're taking our country back
[03:57:32.280 --> 03:57:34.280]  this is dr nick baggage with infowars.com
[03:57:34.280 --> 03:57:40.280]  and we'll see you again next time
[03:58:04.280 --> 03:58:06.280]  there's no better product to help your body fight back
[03:58:34.280 --> 03:58:36.280]  please whatever you do realize
[03:58:36.280 --> 03:58:38.280]  that we're all getting punched drunk to the censorship
[03:58:38.280 --> 03:58:40.280]  and you saw 18 twitter accounts
