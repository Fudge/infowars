[00:00.000 --> 00:05.800]  Look back at the beginning of February 2020 as a true rollercoaster in American history
[00:05.800 --> 00:12.060]  that saw populism victorious over anti-American forces that were crushed under the weight
[00:12.060 --> 00:18.040]  of Providence, real popular opinion, and the hubris of their own statements.
[00:18.040 --> 00:21.320]  We must remove this president to protect our country.
[00:21.320 --> 00:26.000]  For the rest of his life, he's also gonna, people are also gonna remember, he was impeached
[00:26.000 --> 00:27.480]  by the House of Representatives.
[00:27.480 --> 00:32.280]  He was, and as Nancy Pelosi kept saying because she understood once the House was done what
[00:32.280 --> 00:35.120]  the outcome was gonna be in the Senate forever, forever, forever.
[00:35.120 --> 00:40.680]  The impeachment only revealed the severity of the true threat that Democrats have become
[00:40.680 --> 00:43.160]  to the foundation of our republic.
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.760]  The Constitution requires that the House conduct the investigation, including calling witnesses,
[00:48.760 --> 00:53.880]  taking depositions, collecting evidence, and the Senate is charged to rule based on the
[00:53.880 --> 00:57.360]  evidence the House provides.
[00:57.360 --> 01:02.320]  This was designed this way for a very specific reason, very practical reason.
[01:02.320 --> 01:07.200]  And the House committees can investigate these charges while the rest of the House continues
[01:07.200 --> 01:09.560]  to do their legislative work.
[01:09.560 --> 01:13.960]  Unfortunately, in the Senate, when articles of impeachment are brought and sent to the
[01:13.960 --> 01:20.400]  Senate, the Senate, by constitutional law, must stop what it's doing, must open an impeachment
[01:20.400 --> 01:21.400]  hearing.
[01:21.400 --> 01:27.120]  While in informal, a formal impeachment hearing, the Senate cannot do anything else.
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.720]  By law, it goes into legislative shutdown by law.
[01:32.720 --> 01:36.680]  In this case, if we were to call additional witnesses, then we would be setting a dangerous
[01:36.680 --> 01:40.240]  precedent for every future case.
[01:40.240 --> 01:45.480]  Democrats like Senator Coons of Delaware continued to spew statements like this.
[01:45.480 --> 01:51.160]  The legendary Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd Rose, and said, I think my country
[01:51.160 --> 01:58.840]  sinks beneath the yoke, it weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash is added to her wounds.
[01:58.840 --> 02:03.400]  Don't the Democrats know that the rest of us are completely aware that they began as
[02:03.400 --> 02:09.640]  a pro-slavery party, created the Ku Klux Klan, saw to it that Margaret Sanger's extermination
[02:09.640 --> 02:15.560]  plan was carried out, and even in February of 2020 continued to immortalize bigots within
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.720]  their own party, as Coons did with exalted Cyclops, Robert Byrd.
[02:20.720 --> 02:26.360]  As regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory,
[02:26.360 --> 02:29.240]  but also not a crime.
[02:29.240 --> 02:34.120]  Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by
[02:34.120 --> 02:39.800]  the president's counsel that a crime had been committed, the president's insistence
[02:39.800 --> 02:45.120]  that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political
[02:45.120 --> 02:46.600]  pursuit.
[02:46.600 --> 02:51.640]  While Mitt Romney, a turncoat who claimed his religion guided his decision to convict
[02:51.640 --> 02:56.400]  the president, apparently doesn't realize we all know it's because Mitt Romney's top
[02:56.400 --> 03:01.920]  advisor Joseph Kofor Black sat on the same corrupt board at the Ukrainian energy company
[03:01.920 --> 03:08.120]  Barisma at the same time Hunter Biden was raking in millions for political influence.
[03:08.120 --> 03:17.160]  I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is
[03:17.160 --> 03:28.240]  wrong, nor do I like people who say, I pray for you when they know that that's not so.
[03:28.240 --> 03:31.560]  But of course, the madness was hardly over.
[03:31.560 --> 03:36.240]  President Trump delivered a historic State of the Union, while the Democrats, like spoiled
[03:36.240 --> 03:42.680]  children, refused to stand for anything that didn't adhere to their hatred of true American
[03:42.680 --> 03:43.680]  values.
[03:43.680 --> 03:49.880]  Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington
[03:49.880 --> 03:57.640]  are victories that deliver for the American people.
[03:57.640 --> 04:12.960]  We must always remember that our job is to put America first.
[04:12.960 --> 04:17.040]  And now the Democrats are falling apart.
[04:17.040 --> 04:19.640]  This is not going particularly well so far.
[04:19.640 --> 04:22.760]  And why is Tom Perez still the chairman of the Democratic National Committee?
[04:22.760 --> 04:24.640]  I have no idea.
[04:24.640 --> 04:30.120]  This party needs to wake up and make sure that we talk about things that are relevant
[04:30.120 --> 04:31.120]  to people.
[04:31.120 --> 04:36.680]  We need to go back to 2018 where we had good, diverse, strong candidates that had real connections
[04:36.680 --> 04:38.800]  to the community and talked about real things.
[04:38.800 --> 04:41.360]  We don't need to become the British Labor Party.
[04:41.360 --> 04:42.880]  That's a bad thing.
[04:42.880 --> 04:47.440]  And as they face the backlash of the hell they brought upon the executive office and
[04:47.440 --> 04:52.520]  the American people, all anyone can say is that it's long overdue.
[04:52.520 --> 04:56.560]  John Bowne reporting.
[04:56.560 --> 04:57.560]  We'll be right back.
[04:57.560 --> 05:00.320]  Stay with us.
[05:00.320 --> 05:04.640]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Info War, but I know you're like me.
[05:04.640 --> 05:06.560]  You don't want my thanks.
[05:06.560 --> 05:10.440]  You want victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you
[05:10.440 --> 05:12.520]  want them off your back and off your children's back.
[05:12.520 --> 05:13.520]  And you know what?
[05:13.520 --> 05:17.760]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team, and it's why Info Wars
[05:17.760 --> 05:24.640]  has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking
[05:24.640 --> 05:30.440]  action against the globalist because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you
[05:30.440 --> 05:31.680]  are as well.
[05:31.680 --> 05:35.480]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the Info War, and I want to
[05:35.480 --> 05:39.480]  thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.680]  For the bottom of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at Info Wars, I want
[05:43.680 --> 05:47.720]  to thank you all because you are the Info War, and you know that's not just words.
[05:47.720 --> 05:49.560]  It's reality.
[05:49.560 --> 05:51.160]  You have made history.
[05:51.160 --> 05:53.000]  We have made history together.
[05:53.000 --> 06:22.000]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you, and I suggest you use it.
[06:22.000 --> 06:51.960]  Thank you for joining us, my friends, on this Monday, February 10th, 2020, Live Trans
[06:51.960 --> 06:52.960]  Mission.
[06:52.960 --> 06:58.480]  I'll be here live for the next four hours, Lord willing, and I intend to open the phones
[06:58.480 --> 07:03.360]  up, and I intend to take a lot of your phone calls, and I intend to have some very informative
[07:03.360 --> 07:12.960]  guest on with us as well.
[07:12.960 --> 07:22.240]  The coronavirus has broken containment, it's spread all over the modern populated worlds,
[07:22.240 --> 07:30.800]  even showing up on Swiss Alps, ski resort, mountaintops, and it's the response to it
[07:30.800 --> 07:38.040]  by governments that's got everyone so concerned.
[07:38.040 --> 07:42.600]  Then you look at the providence of it, and it's clearly man-made that gets you more concerned.
[07:42.600 --> 07:50.560]  The official number is over 900 dead confirmed cases exceeding 40,000, but we know they're
[07:50.560 --> 07:58.080]  covering up the real numbers of dead, China to quarantine, city of Shenzhen, and of course
[07:58.080 --> 08:11.800]  the big news that has now been announced, China is now locking down their capital city
[08:11.800 --> 08:15.080]  of Beijing.
[08:15.080 --> 08:23.280]  We're going to be looking at all of that today, this is a big deal.
[08:23.280 --> 08:29.360]  Immediately after Beijing quarantine now, Shanghai locked down in response to shocking
[08:29.360 --> 08:37.440]  spread of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.
[08:37.440 --> 08:42.080]  So we're going to be laying it all out here today.
[08:42.080 --> 08:50.280]  Quarantine centers set up at U.S. military bases, DOD reports, of course we first laid
[08:50.280 --> 08:56.360]  all this out, this was going on a few weeks ago, the Pentagon had already set it up, that
[08:56.360 --> 09:03.040]  was exclusively here at Info Wars, and now there it is in the Miami Herald yesterday.
[09:03.040 --> 09:09.800]  Meanwhile, the U.S. has charged four Chinese military members in Equifax breach.
[09:09.800 --> 09:20.400]  More and more Chinese spies are being charged in that ongoing struggle with Communist China.
[09:20.400 --> 09:28.240]  Mike Pompeo has come out to speak to the Governor's Association, pointing out that bipartisanly
[09:28.240 --> 09:37.200]  they are being targeted as well, we're going to be getting to that report, and we're going
[09:37.200 --> 09:43.760]  to talk about how serious could this virus really be, how big could it get?
[09:43.760 --> 09:56.520]  Because the response to it is the largest, most sustained response we've ever seen to
[09:56.520 --> 10:07.120]  a viral outbreak, so is it all a global government hysteria drill, or is it something far worse?
[10:07.120 --> 10:17.560]  That is just some of what we're going to be laying out in those areas today.
[10:17.560 --> 10:26.800]  Also, Attorney General Barr takes on human trafficking in the child welfare system, that's
[10:26.800 --> 10:31.760]  one of the biggest places that it goes on, not saying everybody involved in child welfare
[10:31.760 --> 10:39.000]  is bad, I'm not saying every social worker is bad, in fact most of them are pretty good,
[10:39.000 --> 10:47.560]  but statistically a lot of child trafficking gets covered up by the groups and organizations
[10:47.560 --> 10:54.680]  involved in it, like Dincourt that's been caught kidnapping children for sex slavery,
[10:54.680 --> 10:59.840]  this has been a congressional hearings report confirmed all over the world and caught running
[10:59.840 --> 11:09.760]  many CPS operations in the United States, and Attorney General has come out and spoken
[11:09.760 --> 11:14.880]  out about that, that is a big deal and a big plus for the Attorney General because they
[11:14.880 --> 11:26.720]  do not want that being discussed in the establishment, so this has happened over and over and over
[11:26.720 --> 11:34.320]  again, I also want to hit this when we come back in the second segment, is the first story
[11:34.320 --> 11:42.280]  I want to burrow into in great detail, Charles Murray says we're living in post America,
[11:42.280 --> 11:54.160]  he says move to a small town to survive the collapse, and yes, if we don't turn America
[11:54.160 --> 12:03.040]  around and route the leftist poison ideology that is designed to collapse society, then
[12:03.040 --> 12:09.240]  the producers, whether you be white, black, Hispanic, old, young, but people that want
[12:09.240 --> 12:15.960]  to live like normal humans and want to live in what America was, if you don't want to
[12:15.960 --> 12:20.960]  live in the globalist paradigm that's actually taking us backwards, we're going to have to
[12:20.960 --> 12:27.920]  move to geographic areas and then pass laws and have culture and systems that do not tolerate
[12:27.920 --> 12:35.480]  the left because they don't tolerate us, they come in and take over and then end fair elections.
[12:35.480 --> 12:39.040]  You can pull up all the videos of the illegal aliens lined up in New York and other places
[12:39.040 --> 12:42.600]  being given their driver's license and being told to vote, they're not the enemy but they're
[12:42.600 --> 12:51.120]  being used as a political weapon, we either defeat the left and absolutely repudiate them
[12:51.120 --> 13:00.400]  like we did communism, because that's what it is under another name, or we die at it.
[13:00.400 --> 13:06.360]  Because the left engages in election fraud and is bringing in a permanent underclass
[13:06.360 --> 13:11.040]  that they control who will then be used as a political weapon just as the left's doing
[13:11.040 --> 13:16.560]  in Europe, the exact same thing and you go to any university or turn on any newscast,
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.520]  it is the most anti-white, anti-Christian, anti-western propaganda ever being put out
[13:21.520 --> 13:27.160]  because that's the globalist model they believe will win, big, ruthless, cold-blooded corporations
[13:27.160 --> 13:32.360]  that back communist China and its homogenous activities and its enslavement and two million
[13:32.360 --> 13:37.880]  Muslims and death camps, but that in America we can't even have a border or a wall or say
[13:37.880 --> 13:41.800]  we're not going to let Chinese fly in to the United States during this coronavirus
[13:41.800 --> 13:48.120]  outbreak, the UN says that's bad, but praises China mowing people down with machine guns,
[13:48.120 --> 13:57.360]  but because they're Asian they cannot commit a crime, only Caucasians are capable of any
[13:57.360 --> 14:08.600]  form of moral violations and that's not a sarcastic statement, that's what the left
[14:08.600 --> 14:16.600]  has established and set up and that's what they teach and it's mainly white globalist
[14:16.600 --> 14:25.720]  academics that are teaching it, but they are finding groups of non-whites who are now adopting
[14:25.720 --> 14:32.720]  the most racist inversion of common sense and what people like Dr. Martin Luther King
[14:32.720 --> 14:42.840]  Jr. taught, it's just absolutely a betrayal of decency and the betrayal of America's
[14:42.840 --> 14:47.480]  strengths that we wanted to be open and unify people under an American ideal and because
[14:47.480 --> 14:53.920]  we wanted to see people by the character of their deeds, not their color, their skin,
[14:53.920 --> 15:00.680]  the left has now used that against us and is engaged in classical race-baiting and divide
[15:00.680 --> 15:08.000]  and conquer and are just an absolutely outrageously criminal group of people, but here's the good
[15:08.000 --> 15:13.840]  news, they're losing power all over the world, people are waking up and rejecting them because
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.200]  it's so obvious what they're doing and their corporate controlled media, no matter how
[15:18.200 --> 15:25.920]  much censorship or control they try to bring against competition is continuing to nosedive
[15:25.920 --> 15:35.440]  in viewership and they are beyond irrelevant now and so we are about to witness some very
[15:35.440 --> 15:40.520]  interesting times ahead, but those that have bought into the ideology of the left, they
[15:40.520 --> 15:45.800]  are more enraged than ever because they were promised that they would be the power structure,
[15:45.800 --> 15:51.640]  they would rule, that they were going to inherit the new America and be our jail guards overseeing
[15:51.640 --> 15:57.120]  us in the FEMA camps that Bernie Sanders employees lost after, but of course it never ends up
[15:57.120 --> 15:59.440]  that way, does it?
[15:59.440 --> 16:05.040]  I'm here with Scott Yousiam, founder of OMG Tax, tell us how your company helps our listeners
[16:05.040 --> 16:07.800]  out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:07.800 --> 16:13.200]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments, sometimes
[16:13.200 --> 16:17.040]  in the same day, we even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required
[16:17.040 --> 16:19.760]  to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:19.760 --> 16:22.120]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:22.120 --> 16:23.600]  Oh, can I ever?
[16:23.600 --> 16:29.480]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS, guess what?
[16:29.480 --> 16:33.800]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status
[16:33.800 --> 16:34.800]  with the government.
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.640]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot
[16:39.640 --> 16:45.120]  less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[17:19.680 --> 17:23.560]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the East
[17:23.560 --> 17:25.080]  Bank of the Mississippi.
[17:25.080 --> 17:28.880]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location
[17:28.880 --> 17:32.680]  and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price
[17:32.680 --> 17:37.000]  that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[17:37.000 --> 17:42.640]  So here's what you should do right now, check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.

[20:03.640 --> 20:31.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:31.640 --> 20:38.080]  Charles Murray is a respected individual, like I've read his work for years, watched
[20:38.080 --> 20:42.320]  him on the show, but I'm not taking away from what he said, but it seems like seeing the
[20:42.320 --> 20:44.960]  sky's blue at high noon.
[20:44.960 --> 20:53.040]  Charles Murray, we're living in post-America, moved a small town to survive the collapse.
[20:53.040 --> 20:55.560]  Well, it's not just that.
[20:55.560 --> 20:58.640]  If you want to be happier, if you want to be healthier, if you want to live longer and
[20:58.640 --> 21:07.040]  have more friends, move to a small town and then get involved in micro agriculture.
[21:07.040 --> 21:09.680]  Doesn't even need to be for sale.
[21:09.680 --> 21:16.240]  But every study shows that farmers are more happy, they're more healthy.
[21:16.240 --> 21:21.360]  And the system is trying to make that obsolete and make it as hard as they can for you to
[21:21.360 --> 21:27.120]  not be able to be any level of self-sufficient.
[21:27.120 --> 21:41.560]  The truth is that on five acres of decent soil, you can grow enough food for 100 people.
[21:41.560 --> 21:49.120]  And so if you don't even know what you're doing, you can become self-sufficient in just
[21:49.120 --> 21:51.160]  a few years.
[21:51.160 --> 21:56.480]  But anybody can try to move out of the country, get a piece of land and get a local job and
[21:56.480 --> 22:04.560]  live at a subsistence level and be as happier than a pig and you know what, we are designed
[22:04.560 --> 22:05.560]  to do it.
[22:05.560 --> 22:13.480]  And these modern cities and these modern systems are killing us.
[22:13.480 --> 22:16.840]  And you look at how under Obama and the federal government and everything they could to try
[22:16.840 --> 22:23.120]  to keep people from being able to even live in rural areas, Obama launched an initiative
[22:23.120 --> 22:30.240]  before he left, saying that the rural areas are too white and too rural and that we need
[22:30.240 --> 22:36.960]  to modernize them by putting in federally funded little 10-story buildings in the middle
[22:36.960 --> 22:42.360]  of each small town to then bring in the globalists, bring in the socialists, ship in some refugees,
[22:42.360 --> 22:47.600]  destabilize the town, cause some crime, have some in-fighting, get a bunch of people on
[22:47.600 --> 23:00.680]  welfare and then bring in some homeless and some fentanyl so your teenager can overdose.
[23:00.680 --> 23:05.920]  You see, when you look at what the globalists are doing, it's to bring down civilization,
[23:05.920 --> 23:10.880]  it's to sabotage society and it's in the WikiLeaks that that's what they're doing.
[23:10.880 --> 23:15.840]  The globalists can't rule over self-sufficient people.
[23:15.840 --> 23:20.840]  And the truth is, if you go out to rural areas anywhere, there are diverse groups of people
[23:20.840 --> 23:25.960]  living together in peace, in justice and they know damn well what's going on and they don't
[23:25.960 --> 23:30.920]  want any part of the big city.
[23:30.920 --> 23:34.080]  And if you ever move out of the country, you won't want to move back to the city, ladies
[23:34.080 --> 23:37.320]  and gentlemen.
[23:37.320 --> 23:41.880]  In fact, I haven't been to our family farm and ranch, I've been in the fight so hard
[23:41.880 --> 23:42.880]  in three years.
[23:42.880 --> 23:48.840]  We've got a big farm, big ranches, Texas, beautiful, huge oak trees, cows, whole nine
[23:48.840 --> 23:49.840]  yards.
[23:49.840 --> 23:54.320]  My dad goes out there all the time, I'm just in the war, I just don't go there.
[23:54.320 --> 23:58.480]  Because if I went there, I might not come back.
[23:58.480 --> 24:00.800]  It looks like the hobbits shire or something.
[24:00.800 --> 24:05.320]  I mean, some of the oak trees on our property are as big as the ones you'll see growing
[24:05.320 --> 24:08.480]  on the Colorado River in downtown Austin.
[24:08.480 --> 24:15.480]  You'll think that, again, Frodo Baggins is about to pop out from under one.
[24:15.480 --> 24:18.800]  And that's all over the United States and all over the world.
[24:18.800 --> 24:25.280]  And the establishment is all leaving the big cities for many years, but they're building
[24:25.280 --> 24:30.040]  armored fortresses always on the back side of the hill where you don't see them.
[24:30.040 --> 24:39.720]  And helicopter pads that are concealed and redoubts, why are they doing that?
[24:39.720 --> 24:44.720]  Because they have built a system that is designed to collapse.
[24:44.720 --> 24:49.600]  And I try to explain this to Bernie Sanders supporters, I try to explain to them.
[24:49.600 --> 24:53.320]  You know almost every major billionaire is a globalist or a leftist, because almost
[24:53.320 --> 24:57.840]  all of them made their money in the system that's fiat and they've devalued the currency
[24:57.840 --> 25:07.480]  already 99.8% from what it was 107 years ago with the Federal Reserve Act.
[25:07.480 --> 25:14.320]  And so when you hear about Michael Bloomberg worth $76 billion, if Bloomberg tried to spend
[25:14.320 --> 25:19.760]  his $78 billion, the stock in his company would crash overnight.
[25:19.760 --> 25:24.560]  If Jeff Bezos tried to spend the $167 billion he's got, Amazon would crash.
[25:24.560 --> 25:28.920]  It's not real.
[25:28.920 --> 25:30.480]  They could never spend that money.
[25:30.480 --> 25:33.200]  They could never buy anything with it.
[25:33.200 --> 25:40.520]  Yeah, they've got 500 foot yachts and jet aircrafts and all this, but that's a tiny
[25:40.520 --> 25:44.680]  fraction of the wealth because it isn't real.
[25:44.680 --> 25:53.480]  When you hear that, oh, 1% have half the wealth because it's all laundered, devalued garbage.
[25:53.480 --> 26:01.080]  You could go to Zimbabwe 10 years ago and they had $50 billion notes.
[26:01.080 --> 26:08.080]  You couldn't buy a stake with a $50 billion note.
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.120]  You couldn't buy a suit with a wheelbarrow of them.
[26:12.120 --> 26:18.240]  In fact, you couldn't buy a suit anywhere in the country because it's a collapse nation.
[26:18.240 --> 26:27.680]  Now, was the dictator of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, was he the richest man in the world
[26:27.680 --> 26:32.080]  because he had hundreds of trillions of dollars in his bank account?
[26:32.080 --> 26:35.680]  No, he wasn't.
[26:35.680 --> 26:43.240]  The only place that had any electricity was his palace.
[26:43.240 --> 26:52.600]  So I'm going to explain this again to folks.
[26:52.600 --> 26:56.680]  The United States has been robbed and devalued.
[26:56.680 --> 27:03.000]  People then say, well, then why the hell is Trump continuing the devaluation?
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.040]  I've used this analogy a thousand times, I'll do it again.
[27:06.040 --> 27:10.080]  If you give a dog too many steroids like a Labrador when it's old, it'll make it have
[27:10.080 --> 27:12.080]  a heart attack down the road.
[27:12.080 --> 27:14.440]  If you don't give it the steroids, it'll never be able to get up.
[27:14.440 --> 27:16.440]  It's in so much pain that you've got to put it down.
[27:16.440 --> 27:20.440]  So you can keep a dog alive three, four, five years on steroids, and then one day they're
[27:20.440 --> 27:23.240]  finally going to have a giant heart attack.
[27:23.240 --> 27:28.280]  And my dog did, but I kept him alive.
[27:28.280 --> 27:30.240]  And that's the predicament Trump's in.
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.040]  He hopes he can grow us out of this with innovations and the secret technologies and things that
[27:35.040 --> 27:37.520]  they've suppressed that they call disruptive.
[27:37.520 --> 27:41.120]  And he's trying to get to the point of being able to release those, and he's doing it with
[27:41.120 --> 27:45.960]  drugs and a bunch of things, and he's let us become the number one exporter in the world
[27:45.960 --> 27:50.720]  in just a few years of a natural gas and fossil fuels.
[27:50.720 --> 27:52.360]  That's a good thing as well.
[27:52.360 --> 27:55.560]  But Trump didn't build this mess.
[27:55.560 --> 27:59.200]  And for all the fiscal conservatives, I'm all about that, and I don't want to make people
[27:59.200 --> 28:00.200]  dependent.
[28:00.200 --> 28:04.920]  And I don't like where we're at, but you know what, we're there.
[28:04.920 --> 28:15.040]  And we need to have a larger discussion about how sick this country is and how sick the
[28:15.040 --> 28:21.960]  West is, not to put ourselves down, but to admit that we have to stop tolerating corruption
[28:21.960 --> 28:28.840]  and evil and the leftist agenda that has sinking ship written all over it.
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.600]  And we have to decide and really have a larger discussion over the next few months with the
[28:33.600 --> 28:36.640]  listeners, because I'm making decisions.
[28:36.640 --> 28:40.200]  Should I do everything I do as if we're going to win and turn humanity around?
[28:40.200 --> 28:46.440]  Or should I make the whole broadcast about digging in, giving up on everybody else and
[28:46.440 --> 28:48.440]  just trying to protect ourselves?
[28:48.440 --> 28:53.480]  Because I got to tell you, in the end, they're just going to dig us out of our holes.
[28:53.480 --> 28:55.000]  I really think I just said the answer there.
[28:55.000 --> 28:56.000]  We can't give up.
[28:56.000 --> 28:59.920]  But for a lot of us, for our children, we can run.
[28:59.920 --> 29:04.920]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels
[29:04.920 --> 29:08.720]  may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[29:08.720 --> 29:13.600]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat are
[29:13.600 --> 29:17.120]  just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[29:17.120 --> 29:21.640]  Here how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[29:21.640 --> 29:22.840]  across America.
[29:22.840 --> 29:26.600]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[29:26.600 --> 29:30.560]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier
[29:30.560 --> 29:31.560]  I feel.
[29:31.560 --> 29:33.840]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[29:33.840 --> 29:39.040]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[29:39.040 --> 29:41.520]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[30:49.720 --> 31:05.720]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world, a lot of people that never deliver.
[31:05.720 --> 31:12.760]  Well, I'm here to tell you, Info Wars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of
[31:12.760 --> 31:17.840]  ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists and because of the
[31:17.840 --> 31:22.840]  great team at Info Wars, and we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[31:22.840 --> 31:27.560]  So right now, humanity is awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible,
[31:27.560 --> 31:32.200]  but there's major obstacles coming down the road and the only way we can effectively fight
[31:32.200 --> 31:36.840]  the NWO and stay in the game on Info Wars history to the spirit is your financial support,
[31:36.840 --> 31:43.200]  we make it really easy, at inforwarstore.com, but I am blowing through our backup money
[31:43.200 --> 31:47.400]  right now with our reporters doing triple the work they ever had because they volunteered
[31:47.400 --> 31:52.400]  to do it, and Owen and the rest of the crew will fight 18 hours a day, 7 days a week during
[31:52.400 --> 31:56.400]  this election year that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in the
[31:56.400 --> 31:57.400]  field.
[31:57.400 --> 32:00.400]  Go to infowarsstore.com and fight for your own future.
[32:00.400 --> 32:05.600]  Well, it's here, the year 2020, world governments out in the open, we've got the predicted mass
[32:05.600 --> 32:10.440]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer, and we've got massive, huge
[32:10.440 --> 32:15.520]  censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that
[32:15.520 --> 32:21.320]  promote America, and guns, and freedom, and Jesus, and the family, and the protection
[32:21.320 --> 32:22.320]  of the unborn.
[32:22.320 --> 32:23.320]  Wow.
[32:23.320 --> 32:27.560]  Yes, now we know we're right, the new world order is real, Satanism is real, the pedophile
[32:27.560 --> 32:31.600]  a leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying
[32:31.600 --> 32:36.040]  no, but I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been
[32:36.040 --> 32:40.920]  in Kansas, we have never been in some small, little place that didn't matter, everything
[32:40.920 --> 32:46.000]  we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species, and everything we've
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.400]  gone through and everything we're going to go through, so it's an incredible time to
[32:48.400 --> 32:53.080]  be alive, and I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved, but just remember,
[32:53.080 --> 32:57.760]  your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of infowarsstore.com
[32:57.760 --> 33:24.600]  is critical, so please take action.
[33:24.600 --> 33:33.040]  I want you to think about something, when you turn on the news, or you watch a movie,
[33:33.040 --> 33:37.680]  or you see one of these drug ads, or any of it, if you pull back and think about it,
[33:37.680 --> 33:49.880]  you know the message they're giving you is destructive and designed to hurt you.
[33:49.880 --> 33:57.360]  What type of system would want that?
[33:57.360 --> 34:02.880]  Their individuals have been on sabotaging human development.
[34:02.880 --> 34:08.400]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy, that's who they are, and once you understand that,
[34:08.400 --> 34:16.760]  you're not a victim who's just taking it because you don't know what's going on, now you're
[34:16.760 --> 34:25.520]  aware of the war, and now when you work hard and take your children to school, and when
[34:25.520 --> 34:32.000]  you save extra money, and when you pray to God, and when you're successful, it's in
[34:32.000 --> 34:38.360]  despite of what they're doing, and you are literally a light in the dark of the night
[34:38.360 --> 34:47.200]  resisting them and a leader, just being aware of the enemy is half the battle, and then
[34:47.200 --> 34:51.880]  taking action is the rest of it, because God will carry you the rest of the way, that's
[34:51.880 --> 35:04.040]  how it metaphysically works, and I'm stating basic truce or by noses is the reality, but
[35:04.040 --> 35:10.320]  you think about those caught up in this evil, they believe if they just serve it that they're
[35:10.320 --> 35:15.880]  going to be advanced, and that's why they're freaking out, because they've bet on the system,
[35:15.880 --> 35:20.640]  they've gone along with the system, and while America and the West and others were asleep
[35:20.640 --> 35:28.640]  for the last 50, 60 years, mesmerized by the television, put into a medical trance, literally,
[35:28.640 --> 35:32.640]  people that were part of the structure and in on the globalist program, and there's
[35:32.640 --> 35:38.480]  a lot of them, they thought, man, we are the rulers, this is amazing, no, you were the
[35:38.480 --> 35:50.280]  traitors against God, you were the garbage, and your time is coming to an end, oh, you'll
[35:50.280 --> 35:54.400]  get your big world government and get your big world leader to worship for about a year
[35:54.400 --> 36:03.960]  or so, but as your world system completes itself, it will be collapsing, you're going
[36:03.960 --> 36:12.320]  to force it, don't you worry, you'll get your 15 minutes of fame before your eternity of
[36:12.320 --> 36:21.040]  pain, you'll get to put your boot on our necks and heads and kick us around a little and
[36:21.040 --> 36:31.240]  feel big with your big daddy devil backing you up, but it's only there to test us, the
[36:31.240 --> 36:41.240]  faithful, you see, you're not going to matter in eternity, you don't count, you decided
[36:41.240 --> 36:48.920]  to sell out to death, you decided to give in to evil, you failed the test, and that's
[36:48.920 --> 36:53.480]  why if you physically look at a globalist, they all look like they've had their souls
[36:53.480 --> 37:01.400]  sucked out because they have, they all look fantastically ridiculous because they are,
[37:01.400 --> 37:06.720]  and if you have discernment, you go, what's wrong with these people, why would they serve
[37:06.720 --> 37:23.400]  something like this, and it's because they never knew what hit them, Hitler invades Eastern
[37:23.400 --> 37:33.280]  Europe, Hungary, Romania, places like that, you got George Soros over there and he's 14
[37:33.280 --> 37:45.200]  years old, and they say we need a bloodhound, we have a young Jew that will go into these
[37:45.200 --> 37:53.640]  tenement areas and find where the hidden Jews are and get their property for us, and so
[37:53.640 --> 37:58.840]  for Soros, he goes on 60 minutes and says he's proud of it, that's how you hide it in
[37:58.840 --> 38:03.400]  plain view, you see, but see it didn't go over the way he thought, so now he tries to
[38:03.400 --> 38:10.400]  get that video banned everywhere, but Soros never knew what hit him, did he?
[38:10.400 --> 38:21.960]  So let's put that picture of him now, he looks like a fly, an old fly that a spider
[38:21.960 --> 38:28.400]  sucked the juice out of, just like that photo they showed of John D. Rockefeller, the founder
[38:28.400 --> 38:38.360]  of the Rockefeller family, you think serving evil is good, put John D. Rockefeller back
[38:38.360 --> 38:45.000]  up there guys, there you go, think that old boy is feeling real good before he died, think
[38:45.000 --> 38:52.360]  he's feeling Jesus, you think he's feeling scared, because he's doing everything it told
[38:52.360 --> 39:06.840]  him to, and just like Faust at the end, he knows, oh boy, I screwed up bad.
[39:06.840 --> 39:11.880]  There's nobody more scared than these devil worshipers, that's why they're always trying
[39:11.880 --> 39:18.440]  to scare us, because they're the slaves, they're the fly that got caught in the spider's web,
[39:18.440 --> 39:27.400]  they're not the spider, but the spider is not much more spectacular than them, the revelation
[39:27.400 --> 39:32.760]  when Satan is imprisoned, the thousand years they'll come and look at him and say that
[39:32.760 --> 39:42.560]  conquered us, because we've got that spiritual body, you'll be able to see how big your soul
[39:42.560 --> 39:48.000]  is, you'll be able to see how powerful you are next to God, nothing, and then you'll
[39:48.000 --> 40:01.880]  look at Satan and say that tricked us, that almost won, but only because we were not conscious
[40:01.880 --> 40:06.680]  of it, so I'm going to get into the latest on the virus and I'm going to get into everything
[40:06.680 --> 40:10.800]  that's happened in society, but I think I have the answer, I think you'll agree with
[40:10.800 --> 40:18.280]  me, if you have children, you have a duty to go to rural Christian areas and to raise
[40:18.280 --> 40:24.880]  them outside of the big cities in the suburbs, it's not running to go to those places, but
[40:24.880 --> 40:28.440]  you have to be politically involved and fight for the rest of the nation and against the
[40:28.440 --> 40:33.960]  globalists while you're there, but you need to run with your children to the most conservative
[40:33.960 --> 40:42.720]  Christian nationalist patriot area you can, and then you need to work overtime to try
[40:42.720 --> 40:47.280]  to save the republic itself, because if that fails, the globalists will totally open the
[40:47.280 --> 40:51.480]  borders, bring in hordes of dumbed down populations, turn them against you, and then march them
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.040]  out against you politically to totally enslave you there, and then all you would have done
[40:55.040 --> 41:00.000]  is put it off, but at least your children would not have been taught by convicted pedophiles
[41:00.000 --> 41:10.040]  how to blow jobs at age five, and so it's not just a right, it's a duty, and as soon
[41:10.040 --> 41:16.760]  as I can, I am moving out of Austin, you know, my mom's from here and my family's from here,
[41:16.760 --> 41:22.480]  but it is, I would never move my children to San Francisco, and it's San Francisco in
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.400]  a lot of areas now and it's getting worse, and it's California collapses, and our offices
[41:27.400 --> 41:33.400]  are here, and there's no way I can move these offices, but I certainly can move my children
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.960]  to a safer distance away from Sodom and Gomorrah, and then, in the future, tell it to me again
[41:38.960 --> 41:45.760]  a lot of the time, because we have to put our money where our mouths are, and it really
[41:45.760 --> 41:51.960]  is time to evacuate every major blue city crap hole, and some will argue, well, you're
[41:51.960 --> 42:01.480]  just seeding them the victory, no, they need us, and you've got to get religious about
[42:01.480 --> 42:06.640]  not spending your money with the establishment or with any leftist institutions.
[42:06.640 --> 42:11.160]  You have to take the blood supply, the oxygen supply away from them, and I'm talking to
[42:11.160 --> 42:15.440]  myself when I say this, and you have to totally, as much as you can, cut yourself off from
[42:15.440 --> 42:22.120]  the system, and only invest in that, that is promoting freedom and justice, because they're
[42:22.120 --> 42:25.160]  trying to shut everybody down that doesn't serve them, they're trying to take the NRA's
[42:25.160 --> 42:29.560]  banking away, they're trying to take our banking away, they want to force us into their world
[42:29.560 --> 42:33.840]  government system with their Chinese social score, and so we have to more and more become
[42:33.840 --> 42:41.480]  self-sufficient to say no to that, because we know it's not coming, it's here.
[42:41.480 --> 42:44.160]  Mark of the Beast, world government, it's all happening, so I'll finish up with these
[42:44.160 --> 42:51.600]  clips that I mentioned about US America over, post-America isn't here, and then we'll get
[42:51.600 --> 42:55.800]  into your phone calls in the next hour, and then Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyers,

[44:00.880 --> 44:04.480]  It's Friday evening when I'm cutting this one-minute unscripted ad.
[44:04.480 --> 44:06.440]  I'm just telling you what's going on straight-shoot.
[44:06.440 --> 44:10.840]  We've sold out of the 16-ounce immune gargle with the patented nano-silver that's known
[44:10.840 --> 44:14.760]  to take out SARS, even Homeland Security reports, and A&M reports.
[44:14.760 --> 44:17.360]  Now we've almost sold out of the one-ouncers.
[44:17.360 --> 44:20.600]  We've got three ounces for the next week and a half at current sales rates.
[44:20.600 --> 44:24.880]  This is just great to have regardless, and it's really good for you, and it targets
[44:24.880 --> 44:28.840]  bacteria and viruses across the board, and it funds the M4 war.
[44:28.840 --> 44:35.600]  But if you want to get prepared, get your immune gargle silver at InfowarsStore.com.
[44:35.600 --> 44:41.720]  It's also in our tooth whitening toothpaste, and in our super blue toothpaste as well.
[44:41.720 --> 44:45.280]  We've got plenty of that still, but at current rates it'll sell it about three weeks.
[44:45.280 --> 44:48.120]  So all these great silver products are the very best you're going to find are at one
[44:48.120 --> 45:02.040]  place, InfowarsStore.com, and it funds the M4 war, a 360 win.
[45:02.040 --> 45:05.200]  This should really be easier than it is.
[45:05.200 --> 45:07.280]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[45:07.280 --> 45:10.040]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[45:10.040 --> 45:15.480]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try
[45:15.480 --> 45:21.680]  them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is, and then your support of the product
[45:21.680 --> 45:26.600]  we're selling will help you and will help us, and it's symbiotic.
[45:26.600 --> 45:32.040]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[45:32.040 --> 45:33.320]  the bad halogen.
[45:33.320 --> 45:37.720]  But people told me about it for years, and I didn't listen, and I'm so thankful that
[45:37.720 --> 45:44.120]  finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine,
[45:44.120 --> 45:45.520]  atomic iodine.
[45:45.520 --> 45:51.200]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at InfowarsStore.com, and I'm telling
[45:51.200 --> 45:53.160]  you folks, get it.
[45:53.160 --> 45:54.160]  It's amazing.
[45:54.160 --> 45:57.880]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the M4 war, a 360 win.
[45:57.880 --> 46:03.920]  You can't lose unless you don't take action, but demand for food has not let up.
[46:03.920 --> 46:06.600]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.040]  Everybody else is basically already sold out, or they have giant wait list.
[46:11.040 --> 46:15.920]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken seven to 10 days to deliver, because again, they
[46:15.920 --> 46:16.920]  have to package it.
[46:16.920 --> 46:21.440]  They're running 24 hours a day, but in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a
[46:21.440 --> 46:23.840]  longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[46:23.840 --> 46:24.920]  So I wouldn't crash today.
[46:24.920 --> 46:27.000]  We wanted this virus to be peering out.
[46:27.000 --> 46:28.560]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[46:28.560 --> 46:31.640]  Looks like it is really, really bad, and it is man-made.
[46:31.640 --> 46:34.240]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freak out.
[46:34.240 --> 46:37.560]  So get your storable food at InfowarsStore.com.
[46:37.560 --> 46:38.640]  That helps fund our operation.
[46:38.640 --> 46:39.640]  It's insurance.
[46:39.640 --> 46:41.120]  You can eat a total 360 win.
[46:41.120 --> 46:46.120]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered at InfowarsStore.com.
[46:46.120 --> 46:47.120]  Get your order in.
[46:47.120 --> 46:48.120]  It's locked in.
[46:48.120 --> 46:53.280]  Guaranteed seven to 10 days, InfowarsStore.com, and regardless, it funds the operation.
[46:53.280 --> 46:55.480]  We also have the immune gargle at 40% off.
[46:55.480 --> 47:00.240]  We are going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales price InfowarsStore.com.
[47:25.480 --> 47:41.400]  Communist China has now locked down two more of their biggest cities, including Beijing,
[47:41.400 --> 47:48.040]  their capital city, U.S. military setting up quarantine centers.
[47:48.040 --> 47:53.480]  Across the United States, U.S. military bases, AP Reuters, and Miami Herald are all reporting
[47:53.480 --> 47:59.440]  more communist Chinese cities are now being announced to be under total lockdown and quarantine
[47:59.440 --> 48:03.280]  like Shanghai.
[48:03.280 --> 48:05.000]  Clearly the virus is spreading quickly.
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.840]  It is deadly.
[48:06.840 --> 48:09.200]  But China is also not letting a good crisis go to waste.
[48:09.200 --> 48:10.760]  They're using it as a political crackdown.
[48:10.760 --> 48:15.880]  That's confirmed targeting questions, Buddhists and others.
[48:15.880 --> 48:18.520]  And they're also now eyeing Hong Kong.
[48:18.520 --> 48:24.720]  And that's certainly shut down democracy demonstrations and free speech demonstrations
[48:24.720 --> 48:30.320]  and anti-police state demonstrations there.
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.800]  I want to open the phones up for first-time callers on any subject you want to discuss.
[48:35.800 --> 48:39.960]  But obviously, most of you are going to want to talk, I would imagine, about coronavirus
[48:39.960 --> 48:41.960]  and what you really think is going on behind it.
[48:41.960 --> 48:47.080]  We can also discuss is America done?
[48:47.080 --> 48:52.840]  Sure, we can put off the total collapse for a while, but the societal rot is so massive.
[48:52.840 --> 48:56.080]  Are we in a post-America?
[48:56.080 --> 48:59.840]  We just moved to a small town and hope it all passes over us.
[48:59.840 --> 49:03.800]  Well, quality life is better in a small town if you can take care of yourself and your
[49:03.800 --> 49:08.560]  family in one.
[49:08.560 --> 49:11.360]  People are certainly nicer.
[49:11.360 --> 49:17.320]  The 5G globalist scourge isn't there, the homeless and the gangs aren't there.
[49:17.320 --> 49:21.280]  But how do you then keep the borders from being totally collapsed by the UN?
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.640]  Because the globalists know if they get rid of the Republic, if they get rid of the idea
[49:25.640 --> 49:29.400]  of a wealthy middle class, if they get rid of the idea of America, the whole world's
[49:29.400 --> 49:31.040]  going to fall to complete tyranny.
[49:31.040 --> 49:33.160]  And that's their invented plan.
[49:33.160 --> 49:35.240]  The average leftist says they hate America.
[49:35.240 --> 49:36.240]  They're ethos.
[49:36.240 --> 49:37.600]  They're operating system.
[49:37.600 --> 49:38.600]  Who they are.
[49:38.600 --> 49:43.440]  Their identity is hating their own country, even though most millennials don't even have
[49:43.440 --> 49:49.960]  a passport and can't find their ass with both hands.
[49:49.960 --> 49:53.160]  Living in post-America, move to small town, survive.
[49:53.160 --> 49:59.160]  In FullWars.com, conservative scholar Turrell Murray gave a delightfully black-pilled interview
[49:59.160 --> 50:03.440]  recently where he talked about America's decline and my ordinary folks should consider
[50:03.440 --> 50:08.400]  moving to small town America, which is much more easily open now than it has ever been
[50:08.400 --> 50:15.560]  before, and in many cases still just as Alexis de Tocqueville described in the 1830s.
[50:15.560 --> 50:23.360]  Do what I did, which is live traditional America, and that's open, and that's much more easily
[50:23.360 --> 50:25.520]  open now than it's ever was before.
[50:25.520 --> 50:30.720]  Murray said life sites Jonathan Van Maren last month, I write books calling on hundreds
[50:30.720 --> 50:35.760]  of technical sources, no problems sitting out there in a small town in Maryland.
[50:35.760 --> 50:42.320]  He continued, yeah, but he's not an expert on how to move to the small town, and I'll
[50:42.320 --> 50:47.640]  tell you who he is, is Bill Scalzen, who I've invited to fly here, and it's time to call
[50:47.640 --> 50:50.920]  Savannah, you're producing today, and say, first class, he's got his own private jet,
[50:50.920 --> 50:55.700]  he flies around in his pilot himself, come here, do his presentation, he's a leading
[50:55.700 --> 50:59.600]  expert on strategic relocation and where you should move and what you should do.
[50:59.600 --> 51:04.520]  We sell the big book, I made the film with him, they're exclusively available, the film
[51:04.520 --> 51:08.280]  as well as the book at infowarsstore.com, you can get it from his side as well, but
[51:08.280 --> 51:12.600]  the film's at infowarsstore.com exclusively, but both are excellent, I didn't mean to go
[51:12.600 --> 51:16.880]  off into a plug for strategic relocation, but it's incredible the research he's done
[51:16.880 --> 51:23.840]  on the safest, best, most sustainable places in the United States to move.
[51:23.840 --> 51:27.880]  Let's go ahead and play a clip from that podcast with Charles Murray, we were just talking
[51:27.880 --> 51:28.880]  about.
[51:28.880 --> 51:33.280]  What would collapse look like in your view?
[51:33.280 --> 51:48.720]  Well, if you're talking about the American experiment, it already has.
[51:48.720 --> 51:54.120]  In practice, there are still large swaths of the country which are living a very traditional
[51:54.120 --> 51:55.120]  American life.
[51:55.120 --> 52:01.200]  I'm in one of them, I'm in a small town in Maryland, last week our post office and
[52:01.200 --> 52:05.640]  a house burned down, a house with four apartments, and I won't go through all the things that
[52:05.640 --> 52:10.680]  the community immediately did, but they were all the classic things, of taking care of
[52:10.680 --> 52:15.680]  neighbors, of making things right, and I don't live in an atypical small town, small towns
[52:15.680 --> 52:22.640]  all over the country like that, but as far as any constitutional limits on the authority
[52:22.640 --> 52:29.520]  of the government, the idea of the federal government as the founder saw it, that's dead
[52:29.520 --> 52:30.760]  as a doornail.
[52:30.760 --> 52:35.600]  I don't care how many Supreme Court justices we get, like Gorsuch and so forth, there
[52:35.600 --> 52:41.720]  are certain things where you can't roll black back the clock, because to do so would require
[52:41.720 --> 52:46.680]  declaring that about 97% of what the federal government does is unconstitutional, and that
[52:46.680 --> 52:48.920]  ain't going to happen.
[52:48.920 --> 52:59.840]  So I think that America is showing what post-America looks like, where you have people who call
[52:59.840 --> 53:09.320]  themselves conservatives, who believe things that would horrify the founders, where all
[53:09.320 --> 53:15.040]  sorts of ideals, basically we're going to be a rich, powerful country, and you'll still
[53:15.040 --> 53:24.720]  have Americans saying USA, USA at sports events and so forth, but the sense of the American
[53:24.720 --> 53:30.280]  way of life, which was something that was in common use, a phrase that was in common
[53:30.280 --> 53:39.680]  use until 50 years ago, will be meaningless, or already is meaningless.
[53:39.680 --> 53:45.720]  Except, I knew that we could get a president elected, and I knew we could take the Republican
[53:45.720 --> 53:50.320]  Party over, and I knew we could see nationalist and populist get elected all over the place.
[53:50.320 --> 53:55.320]  In just the last five years, we've seen Brexit fought through and won, we've seen Trump
[53:55.320 --> 53:59.600]  elected, we've seen the globalist in deep trouble, the chai comms now on their knees
[53:59.600 --> 54:08.600]  from being the age of the dragon, and we're all done, but if the listeners, the vanguard
[54:08.600 --> 54:12.880]  of the resistance, if you run for office, if you get aggressive, if you go get in people's
[54:12.880 --> 54:16.680]  faces, if you go tell the pedophile rings, they're not going to have drag queens story
[54:16.680 --> 54:19.680]  time at your schools, they're getting canceled by the way all over the world.
[54:19.680 --> 54:26.960]  If you tell colleges and academics, I'm not going to support you if you don't stop this
[54:26.960 --> 54:34.680]  brainwashing, if you start using your political and spiritual and financial and cultural muscle,
[54:34.680 --> 54:36.200]  there's nothing you can't do.
[54:36.200 --> 54:41.000]  But yeah, if everybody just wants to hide out in their small town and watch everything
[54:41.000 --> 54:45.760]  fall apart and not engage in leadership, you're damn right, the American dream is completely
[54:45.760 --> 54:46.760]  over.
[54:46.760 --> 54:47.760]  But I want to explain something.
[54:47.760 --> 54:55.240]  There's nowhere to hide, there's nowhere to run, and America was never perfect.
[54:55.240 --> 55:00.840]  It's always had problems, and Hollywood is collapsing, and its societal rot has gone
[55:00.840 --> 55:05.260]  too far, and people are peeking out, they're done with it.
[55:05.260 --> 55:10.280]  So if we just create art and culture and literature that's wholesome and good, and if we stand
[55:10.280 --> 55:15.520]  up and promote freedom, people are going to come to us.
[55:15.520 --> 55:20.320]  That's why big tech wants to censor everybody now, that's why they want to block all voices,
[55:20.320 --> 55:24.080]  because they can't compete with the truth we're putting out, and they're there to bite
[55:24.080 --> 55:28.560]  us like a cobra and poison us so they can dominate us and control us.
[55:28.560 --> 55:33.520]  Because a good, upwardly mobile, connected to God group of people won't go along with
[55:33.520 --> 55:39.800]  the plan they're selling, because the plan they're selling sucks.
[55:39.800 --> 55:44.520]  I think we can beat a plan that stinks that nobody really wants.
[55:44.520 --> 55:48.160]  They may get a bunch of people with two or three college degrees that bought into it
[55:48.160 --> 55:51.720]  and are totally unhappy, and want to force us to go along with it because they've been
[55:51.720 --> 55:53.200]  promised positions in it.
[55:53.200 --> 55:57.680]  They may get a bunch of those losers to be mad at us, and they'll all give them TV shows
[55:57.680 --> 56:03.640]  and put them up there and force feed them to us, but nobody's buying what they're saying.
[56:03.640 --> 56:08.400]  The coolest thing out there for a decade running is hating Hollywood, and now it's gone from
[56:08.400 --> 56:14.840]  being cool to a religion.
[56:14.840 --> 56:18.880]  This author, we just played a clip of, talks about Alexander de Tocqueville and the American
[56:18.880 --> 56:24.320]  system and the little towns and the rural farmers and the yeoman farmers that Thomas
[56:24.320 --> 56:27.400]  Jefferson talked about, but did he miss the main part?
[56:27.400 --> 56:32.880]  That the American spirit was about pissing on someone just given power because of who
[56:32.880 --> 56:37.760]  their family was, or someone being arrogant, or someone dressed up all fancy, festooned
[56:37.760 --> 56:40.640]  with a bunch of stuff trying to impress people.
[56:40.640 --> 56:43.200]  Americans rejected that.
[56:43.200 --> 56:50.360]  They wanted real, and rugged, and strong, and truthful, and somebody that was committed
[56:50.360 --> 56:55.200]  to doing what they said they'd do because that's the type of people you want to build
[56:55.200 --> 56:56.200]  a world with.
[56:56.200 --> 56:57.800]  It's the type of woman you want.
[56:57.800 --> 56:59.280]  It's the type of man you want.
[56:59.280 --> 57:00.720]  It's the type of children you want.
[57:00.720 --> 57:02.280]  It's the type of town you want.
[57:02.280 --> 57:04.480]  It's the type of people you want.
[57:04.480 --> 57:09.280]  And everybody knows, everybody wanted to get here, not because we had Hollywood and Drag
[57:09.280 --> 57:15.280]  Queen Storytime and all of the freaked out fashion shows and bananas taped to the wall,
[57:15.280 --> 57:20.400]  $100,000 joke art shows to invert reality, but because it was a place where you had a
[57:20.400 --> 57:25.760]  chance to be yourself and be rugged and pull it all on the table and roll the dice.
[57:25.760 --> 57:31.880]  I'll take the real Wild Wild West, that's America, over their whole globalist nanny
[57:31.880 --> 57:38.680]  state BS system any day, and I'll bet on you every time because I know you've got what
[57:38.680 --> 57:45.200]  it takes and you really want reality, and we've tested it, we've already won fantastically,
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.720]  and our greatest days are ahead, but there are massive challenges.
[57:49.720 --> 57:54.240]  Almost all the other big storyable food companies are sold out of food, but I know for a fact
[57:54.240 --> 57:58.020]  from the sources they're telling people, oh, we've got it, get your order in, two weeks
[57:58.020 --> 57:59.020]  for delivery.
[57:59.020 --> 58:00.680]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[58:00.680 --> 58:05.120]  I've been on radio for 25 years, I've had storyable food for a long time, and I learned
[58:05.120 --> 58:09.400]  very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis
[58:09.400 --> 58:13.360]  they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[58:13.360 --> 58:18.080]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company
[58:18.080 --> 58:21.480]  out there, and I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on
[58:21.480 --> 58:24.440]  hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say
[58:24.440 --> 58:27.640]  they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're
[58:27.640 --> 58:28.640]  good people.
[58:28.640 --> 58:31.640]  So we're saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food but they've got
[58:31.640 --> 58:33.560]  a package at record level orders.
[58:33.560 --> 58:38.320]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[58:38.320 --> 58:42.440]  So get your orders at infowarsword.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first, they're
[58:42.440 --> 58:46.320]  in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the info as well, so get prepared
[58:46.320 --> 58:50.760]  infowarsword.com with storyable foods.
[58:50.760 --> 58:56.000]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[58:56.000 --> 59:01.200]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[59:01.200 --> 59:08.040]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[59:08.040 --> 59:13.920]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[59:13.920 --> 59:16.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[59:16.800 --> 59:22.160]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[59:22.160 --> 59:27.200]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[59:27.200 --> 59:28.200]  symptoms.
[59:28.200 --> 59:33.320]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine, in fact, current
[59:33.320 --> 59:37.800]  research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is
[59:37.800 --> 59:42.600]  an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[59:42.600 --> 59:45.320]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[59:45.320 --> 59:53.600]  Get to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[59:53.600 --> 1:00:22.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:22.440 --> 1:00:25.800]  Enjoy this important report.
[1:00:25.800 --> 1:00:30.120]  The dawn of race-specific bio warfare is upon us.
[1:00:30.120 --> 1:00:41.880]  This bio attack is race-specific, targeting specifically Chinese military-age males and
[1:00:41.880 --> 1:00:47.680]  then almost all the people infected and almost all of those dying are males.
[1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:52.880]  It's hidden in the literature, the medical reports, and then you get the scan by the
[1:00:52.880 --> 1:01:02.040]  major Indian scientific gene splicing university and it's conclusive.
[1:01:02.040 --> 1:01:08.760]  And now other groups have looked at it and said, yeah, it's even got the insertion gene
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:16.480]  that you see with RNA and gene editing where it was injected.
[1:01:16.480 --> 1:01:19.600]  There's signatures right there.
[1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:25.640]  So I'm not going to give the U.S. government a pass and say for sure that somebody in the
[1:01:25.640 --> 1:01:31.760]  deep state on the American team didn't pissed and enough fentanyl being shipped in every
[1:01:31.760 --> 1:01:34.920]  couple months to kill the entire world population.
[1:01:34.920 --> 1:01:37.200]  You're like, that's what's shipped into the U.S.?
[1:01:37.200 --> 1:01:38.200]  Yes.
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:39.200]  Enough to kill the whole world.
[1:01:39.200 --> 1:01:45.120]  In a massive bust, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yoz saying, quote, the quantity of fentanyl
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:50.360]  in this case amounts to chemical warfare and a weapon of mass destruction.
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:54.480]  That's why you see homeless everywhere laying out asleep during the day or sleep at night.
[1:01:54.480 --> 1:01:55.480]  They're not asleep.
[1:01:55.480 --> 1:01:56.880]  They're passed out on fentanyl.
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:01.080]  But you pull back from this and you think about what's going on in China.
[1:02:01.080 --> 1:02:04.800]  They need an excuse to clamp down on their political enemies, a way to unify the population
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:10.680]  or control, a way to get the world to endorse their tyranny, something Trump suddenly done
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:11.680]  that's wrong.
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:19.160]  You're like, oh, they would never kill millions of their own military, it's called a balance.
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:25.000]  I did fall pregnant for a second time, Zhang Xinping tells me, but I had an abortion.
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:29.520]  Did you have a choice?
[1:02:29.520 --> 1:02:31.920]  I couldn't keep it, she replies.
[1:02:31.920 --> 1:02:36.000]  You either go willingly or the government comes for you.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.120]  That's what the Chai comms talk about, one child policy.
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:40.120]  This is even from Wikipedia.
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:43.400]  I don't just believe Wikipedia links through all the government sources.
[1:02:43.400 --> 1:02:49.560]  According to Chinese government, 400 million births have been prevented and tens of millions
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:52.560]  have been killed after they're born.
[1:02:52.560 --> 1:02:59.120]  China's sex ratio is out of whack, 117.7 boys to every 100 girls.
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:02.600]  That means higher crime rates and fewer eligible brides.
[1:03:02.600 --> 1:03:09.160]  So if they'll kill 400 million people, mainly girls, will they release a race specific bio
[1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:11.760]  weapon only targeting military aged men?
[1:03:11.760 --> 1:03:16.680]  Yes, because they've done the demographics and they've got an internal problem because
[1:03:16.680 --> 1:03:25.240]  there's hundreds of millions of more men than women and they can't find women.
[1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:30.320]  So see, first they took the girls away from you and they let you get up to 30 years old
[1:03:30.320 --> 1:03:34.440]  or whatever, let you extinguish some of your energy and now they're just going to kill
[1:03:34.440 --> 1:03:35.440]  you.
[1:03:35.440 --> 1:03:36.440]  The evidence mounts.
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:37.440]  This is a race specific bio weapon.
[1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:41.680]  Well, we know it's that, the evidence mounts that the Chikon's launches against themselves
[1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:48.240]  to save face about their economic collapse, their lost war with the U.S. and is a way
[1:03:48.240 --> 1:03:50.440]  to clamp down and control their population.
[1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:55.000]  I remember my grandfather going, they want us to have a nuclear war.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:59.080]  The Chinese dictator, whoever it was after Mao died, says he wants us to nuke them because
[1:03:59.080 --> 1:04:01.840]  they want to get rid of their population and that they're the only group in the world that
[1:04:01.840 --> 1:04:02.840]  wants to get rid of them.
[1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:07.200]  That's why they fit into this world government scheme to reduce the population and I'm telling
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:15.320]  you, they'll release a race specific weapon and blame it on us, that's the plan.
[1:04:15.320 --> 1:04:18.280]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[1:04:18.280 --> 1:04:22.400]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:25.880]  Join Band-Aught Video and I will complete your training.
[1:04:25.880 --> 1:04:32.320]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:40.360]  All right, lock yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, because we're going to get the
[1:04:40.360 --> 1:04:44.560]  number out when we come back and head all the big breaking news straight ahead on the
[1:04:44.560 --> 1:04:45.560]  other side.
[1:04:45.560 --> 1:04:49.360]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and this is the Info War.
[1:04:49.360 --> 1:04:53.120]  This is the pro-human transmission.
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:04:58.520]  This is the resistance.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:04.080]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week,
[1:05:04.080 --> 1:05:09.720]  and that's ultimate fish oil for 33% off.
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:10.720]  It's amazing.
[1:05:10.720 --> 1:05:12.200]  Go check it out for yourself.
[1:05:12.200 --> 1:05:18.440]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling deep-earth crystals iodine, the good halogen
[1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:21.560]  that is the building block to everything in the body, and I just can't tell you enough
[1:05:21.560 --> 1:05:22.680]  how important it is.
[1:05:22.680 --> 1:05:26.560]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never
[1:05:26.560 --> 1:05:27.560]  got enough iodine.
[1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:32.760]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off, InfoWarStore.com, and it funds the Info War,
[1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:39.680]  and then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together, super high quality, winter sun.
[1:05:39.680 --> 1:05:41.640]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[1:05:41.640 --> 1:05:44.240]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:45.440]  That's why people get so sick.
[1:05:45.440 --> 1:05:46.440]  That's the main reason.
[1:05:46.440 --> 1:05:49.320]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue, get higher absorption.
[1:05:49.320 --> 1:05:50.320]  It's amazing.
[1:05:50.320 --> 1:05:55.120]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfoWarStore.com.
[1:05:55.120 --> 1:06:16.040]  Check yourself, and fund the Info War, 360 win.
[1:06:16.040 --> 1:06:20.880]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central, I am here live, right after the
[1:06:20.880 --> 1:06:28.360]  David Knight Show, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., after I end my transmission, Owen Schreuer, and
[1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:32.480]  when she's co-hosting Savannah Hernandez to take over.
[1:06:32.480 --> 1:06:33.480]  We're InfoWars.
[1:06:33.480 --> 1:06:38.760]  We file a lot of live reports, a lot of special reports, and we're demonized and lied about
[1:06:38.760 --> 1:06:44.400]  by the control corporate media because they are a bunch of puppets who follow their orders
[1:06:44.400 --> 1:06:50.000]  and they can't stand the existence of real individuals that aren't always right, but
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.680]  are trying to tell the truth and that are independent and that are captains of their
[1:06:54.680 --> 1:06:59.120]  own ship.
[1:06:59.120 --> 1:07:02.240]  So here we are in defiance of their tyranny.
[1:07:02.240 --> 1:07:07.880]  I want to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast.
[1:07:07.880 --> 1:07:13.840]  On any topic you want to discuss, any issue you want to break down, obviously the coronavirus
[1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:15.880]  outbreak is getting out of control.
[1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:21.240]  They've locked down Beijing, the capital of China, and other major cities now they're
[1:07:21.240 --> 1:07:27.720]  announcing and the footage coming out of people being mass arrested and put into small dog
[1:07:27.720 --> 1:07:33.600]  kennel like cubes begging for their lives and run after Beijing was quarantined.
[1:07:33.600 --> 1:07:35.600]  Now Shanghai's been locked down.
[1:07:35.600 --> 1:07:39.680]  This is definitely being used with the Chi Coms as a political power grab as well with
[1:07:39.680 --> 1:07:41.680]  the UN praising their action.
[1:07:41.680 --> 1:07:47.360]  And again, the US blocks planes from China, we're racist, the UN said that as well.
[1:07:47.360 --> 1:07:48.840]  That's just oxymoronic.
[1:07:48.840 --> 1:07:54.040]  They don't criticize Russia's stopping flights up two weeks ago and closing their border
[1:07:54.040 --> 1:07:55.040]  a week and a half ago.
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:56.520]  Oh no, that's wonderful or other people.
[1:07:56.520 --> 1:07:59.520]  No, no, it's us.
[1:07:59.520 --> 1:08:04.560]  It's us.
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:06.440]  We're the bad guys.
[1:08:06.440 --> 1:08:08.960]  China says don't be on the streets.
[1:08:08.960 --> 1:08:09.960]  Where are they going to get food?
[1:08:09.960 --> 1:08:11.840]  Where are they going to get?
[1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:12.840]  But think about this.
[1:08:12.840 --> 1:08:14.400]  What happens when the food and stuff runs out?
[1:08:14.400 --> 1:08:18.720]  The virus incubates with eight to 10 days and you can get it again after you've had
[1:08:18.720 --> 1:08:19.720]  it.
[1:08:19.720 --> 1:08:25.200]  Can we put up on screen the official UN death toll and kind of show that map for TV viewers?
[1:08:25.200 --> 1:08:33.880]  Because we know it's definitely way higher than they're saying, but is the response overblown?
[1:08:33.880 --> 1:08:38.720]  US government setting up quarantine centers here in the United States, US military.
[1:08:38.720 --> 1:08:40.200]  We told you that two weeks ago.
[1:08:40.200 --> 1:08:43.200]  Didn't want to scare folks, but they were thinking it was going to be big and it was
[1:08:43.200 --> 1:08:44.200]  already being set up.
[1:08:44.200 --> 1:08:45.200]  Here it is all confirmed.
[1:08:45.200 --> 1:08:57.320]  Miami Herald toll free number to join us is 877-789-2539-877-789 Alex or 877-789-2539.
[1:08:57.320 --> 1:09:01.360]  And if you're in China and you can get through the line, you'll go to the front of the line.
[1:09:01.360 --> 1:09:02.360]  877-789-2539.
[1:09:02.360 --> 1:09:13.720]  And guys, put on screen for me the international line dial the US country code and 512-646-1776
[1:09:13.720 --> 1:09:20.200]  512-646-1776.
[1:09:20.200 --> 1:09:25.840]  In other news, Pompeo sounds alarm over China attempt to suppress free speech.
[1:09:25.840 --> 1:09:33.760]  US charges for Chinese military members in Equifax breach.
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:37.680]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[1:09:37.680 --> 1:09:41.320]  Attorney General Barr takes on human trafficking and child welfare system.
[1:09:41.320 --> 1:09:45.680]  There's video up on national file.com and infowars.com will be covering that.
[1:09:45.680 --> 1:09:51.440]  They're calling it fake video where people take Pelosi tearing up Trump's speech and
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:54.000]  then add it to things and repeat it over and over again.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:56.320]  You know, it's called a meme.
[1:09:56.320 --> 1:10:01.880]  But when photographers edit video of Trump looking insane, that's okay.
[1:10:01.880 --> 1:10:02.880]  That's not fake.
[1:10:02.880 --> 1:10:10.960]  But when it, when it isn't fake, well, it's got to be, it's got to be gotten rid of.
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:16.840]  So all of that is coming up, but they're now announcing AI is going to be watching everything
[1:10:16.840 --> 1:10:25.960]  you post and do, and if, if they decide that it's edited, you can't have it.
[1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:28.480]  So they're telling the general public, you can't edit video.
[1:10:28.480 --> 1:10:32.960]  So you notice a year and a half ago, it's Van Alex Jones, a year and a half later, it's
[1:10:32.960 --> 1:10:35.240]  oh, you can't edit video, put it on the internet.
[1:10:35.240 --> 1:10:41.040]  Any edited video, zooming it in, slowing it down, repeating something, you're not allowed.
[1:10:41.040 --> 1:10:43.720]  We call that fake news.
[1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:50.120]  That's why I'll politifact and people fact check comics now.
[1:10:50.120 --> 1:10:56.560]  They fact check memes because they're waging war on just human interaction and saying,
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:11:05.360]  oh, you're trying to deceive somebody who are not doing any such thing.
[1:11:05.360 --> 1:11:12.080]  This is what's done over and over and over again by these people.
[1:11:12.080 --> 1:11:16.840]  Okay, we're going to go to break in a few minutes, come back, go to all of your phone
[1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:17.840]  calls.
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:21.960]  But I, I did want to spend some time on something that really gives you an idea of how bad this
[1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:23.480]  coronavirus really is.
[1:11:23.480 --> 1:11:31.520]  I told you two weeks ago that almost all the other major food distributors were actually
[1:11:31.520 --> 1:11:37.240]  sold out of food and trying to now buy up more food, but that our big sponsor that we've
[1:11:37.240 --> 1:11:41.360]  had for over 10 years, my payment supply had plenty of food on hand, but they were honest
[1:11:41.360 --> 1:11:45.040]  that there was a seven to 10 day wait because they had the package yet run in 24 hours a
[1:11:45.040 --> 1:11:50.160]  day, three or four times the biggest volume of ordering that they've ever seen with Homeland
[1:11:50.160 --> 1:11:56.840]  Security and with FEMA and with the Office of Personnel, all of them trying to call and
[1:11:56.840 --> 1:12:01.600]  buy up whatever food they had for their quarantine centers around the United States.
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:05.520]  Remember, that was two weeks ago, I told you they're setting up quarantine centers and
[1:12:05.520 --> 1:12:10.160]  they want emergency backup food for folks inside quarantine centers.
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:14.160]  But the US government already has huge stockpiles of storeable food, so why would they be wanting
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:15.160]  even more?
[1:12:15.160 --> 1:12:18.480]  Because a lot of it's 20, 30 years old and the government employees want good stuff
[1:12:18.480 --> 1:12:22.560]  and they know my Patriots good, but they're buying up everything already.
[1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:25.880]  Now a lot of these other companies, I don't have my sponsors, I could have six, seven
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:31.640]  food sponsors right now, I don't because I learned early on if there's not a big rush
[1:12:31.640 --> 1:12:36.080]  and there's nothing going on, they got the food and you know, it's okay.
[1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:38.880]  But when there's a problem, no, they'll take your order, but they won't ship it out to
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:42.400]  you for a few months until they finally get the money and then make the food and put it
[1:12:42.400 --> 1:12:43.400]  all together.
[1:12:43.400 --> 1:12:47.240]  When you order at infoworkstore.com, you get the lowest price from a full catalog of my
[1:12:47.240 --> 1:12:52.240]  Patriots supply, it funds our operation and they're in our back end, they get the orders,
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:57.760]  it goes right into queue with them and you get it just as fast as anybody else that orders
[1:12:57.760 --> 1:13:02.440]  from them and it supports the operation.
[1:13:02.440 --> 1:13:06.760]  And now it's 10 to 14 days, they're right at about 10 days right now, so they just want
[1:13:06.760 --> 1:13:13.600]  to say 10 to 14 because the orders aren't going down, they're intensifying because folks
[1:13:13.600 --> 1:13:19.080]  know this is really serious now, but for 2020, for economic issues down the road, for inflation,
[1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:23.880]  for a possible depression for any reason, this is insurance you can eat.
[1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:26.400]  This is stuff that you can save and know that you're always going to use.
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:31.360]  If you don't use your car insurance, you're medical, well, it's money loss, but with this,
[1:13:31.360 --> 1:13:36.440]  it tastes as good as 10 years as it does today and a lot of this food is indistinguishable
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:41.920]  from gourmet type stuff, you get a store, some of it tastes okay, but for the price
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:45.840]  you're getting the best high quality stuff there is out there, nobody can come close,
[1:13:45.840 --> 1:13:50.400]  they're cheaper than all the major competitors and they want to be so that you come back
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:51.400]  to them over and over again.
[1:13:51.400 --> 1:13:54.680]  They're now the biggest storeable food company in the United States, they have the great
[1:13:54.680 --> 1:14:01.240]  Alexa Pure filtration, EC's top rated, their air filters top rated, but half the price of
[1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:04.640]  competitors, they have the same philosophy as I do, so I want to go out and get one
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:09.200]  sponsor, one supplier that's just good year after year that you get a great response from
[1:14:09.200 --> 1:14:17.440]  that I use and that you get quality products from and so it's there, it's available right
[1:14:17.440 --> 1:14:22.040]  now and I would advise everybody, if you've been on the fence about a four week supply,
[1:14:22.040 --> 1:14:27.960]  about a three month supply, about a six month supply, about a year supply, this is something
[1:14:27.960 --> 1:14:34.280]  that everybody that can should have and it's in these great high quality plastic tote containers
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:39.440]  that are sealed, then it's got sealed packaging inside of that, it's absolutely filled to
[1:14:39.440 --> 1:14:44.800]  the brim, you're not paying for air here folks, this is the best bang for your buck out there,
[1:14:44.800 --> 1:14:50.920]  that's why they are our supplier, so don't wait anymore, go to m4warstore.com, get your
[1:14:50.920 --> 1:14:55.800]  order in today and know that you will be at the front of the line to get it as quickly
[1:14:55.800 --> 1:15:00.840]  as possible, you get it in, it's guaranteed 10 to 14 days, they have the food, it's just
[1:15:00.840 --> 1:15:07.400]  that they've got to package it and it is crazy, the volume, almost no one else has any food,
[1:15:07.400 --> 1:15:11.460]  if they tell you they do, they're lying to you or you're going to get 20 year old sea
[1:15:11.460 --> 1:15:18.000]  rations in my experience, it just does not exist out there and I was there two weeks
[1:15:18.000 --> 1:15:21.440]  ago when they were saying should we spend everything we get coming in to order more
[1:15:21.440 --> 1:15:25.080]  food for other folks, do you think this is how bad, I said you know I think your gut
[1:15:25.080 --> 1:15:29.840]  level is right, I said go all in, I think unfortunately you know in a month you'll be
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:32.880]  selling more food than you are now because I think this is pretty serious, the response
[1:15:32.880 --> 1:15:36.880]  we're seeing is really serious and regardless, the 2020 is a crazy year, people will be prepared
[1:15:36.880 --> 1:15:40.960]  and so they've purchased a ton more food and it's all coming in, all getting ready, but
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:45.560]  you order now, you're ordering food, they have in stock that you will get but I would

[1:17:59.120 --> 1:18:04.520]  The demand for food has not let up, we are selling record amounts of it, everybody else
[1:18:04.520 --> 1:18:08.680]  is basically already sold out or they have giant wait list.
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:13.560]  Our suppliers have it in-house, mistaken seven to ten days to deliver because again they
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.280]  have to package it, they are running 24 hours a day but in a few days they are telling me
[1:18:18.280 --> 1:18:21.480]  it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order yet.
[1:18:21.480 --> 1:18:25.200]  So I wouldn't crash today, we wanted this virus to be peering out, we wanted it to just
[1:18:25.200 --> 1:18:30.280]  be hide, looks like it is really, really bad and it is man made and so that's why we are

[1:18:57.360 --> 1:19:03.040]  Well it's here, the year 2020, world governments out in the open, we've got the predicted mass
[1:19:03.040 --> 1:19:07.240]  pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer and we've got massive
[1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:12.920]  huge censorship taking place, it's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that
[1:19:12.920 --> 1:19:19.880]  promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn,
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:20.880]  wow.
[1:19:20.880 --> 1:19:24.960]  Yes now we know we're right, the new world order is real, Satanism is real, the pedophile
[1:19:24.960 --> 1:19:29.080]  a leader real but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying
[1:19:29.080 --> 1:19:33.480]  no but I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been
[1:19:33.480 --> 1:19:39.240]  in Kansas, we have never been in some smallville place that didn't matter, everything we do,
[1:19:39.240 --> 1:19:43.880]  every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through
[1:19:43.880 --> 1:19:46.600]  and everything we're going to go through, so it's an incredible town to be alive, I'm
[1:19:46.600 --> 1:19:51.040]  going to thank you all for being aware and being involved but just remember your action
[1:19:51.040 --> 1:19:56.280]  now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of infowarsstore dot com is critical
[1:19:56.280 --> 1:20:01.640]  so please take action.
[1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:11.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:11.640 --> 1:20:24.920]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want to stop tyranny?
[1:20:24.920 --> 1:20:37.680]  Well so does he, live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting world-wide, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:37.680 --> 1:20:44.160]  You know I was thinking this morning when I woke up, the Democrats have been very very
[1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:52.360]  silent since Trump was acquitted in the Senate last week, in fact right after it happened
[1:20:52.360 --> 1:20:57.040]  there was almost no coverage on CNN, it was just like a footnote and now they're just
[1:20:57.040 --> 1:21:01.600]  calling him the impeach president and they've moved on to other stories.
[1:21:01.600 --> 1:21:04.840]  So as soon as the Russiagate fell apart, they kind of shut up about that for a while, moved
[1:21:04.840 --> 1:21:12.400]  on to Ukraine, what scandal are they going to cook up next and try to get the president
[1:21:12.400 --> 1:21:18.280]  on the defensive so he can't get his policies through, is there going to be a woman saying
[1:21:18.280 --> 1:21:26.800]  he raped them, is there going to be, there's a tape of the president saying the n-word?
[1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:31.960]  Who knows what they're going to pull or what they're going to do, just more fake garbage,
[1:21:31.960 --> 1:21:35.400]  more lies, more disinformation.
[1:21:35.400 --> 1:21:40.760]  But that's just a question to all the listeners, Bill and Greg and Hayden and Presley and
[1:21:40.760 --> 1:21:46.480]  Levi and Smig and Chris and Debbie and CJ, they're calling about different topics and
[1:21:46.480 --> 1:21:52.800]  I don't want to hear from you but I'm just simply asking, they're deathly quiet right
[1:21:52.800 --> 1:21:59.200]  now, they don't have a new allegation anymore.
[1:21:59.200 --> 1:22:04.520]  What is it going to be?
[1:22:04.520 --> 1:22:08.320]  I mean their talking point has been that he wasn't exonerated and that he wasn't found
[1:22:08.320 --> 1:22:10.680]  not guilty even though he was.
[1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:17.040]  Now acquitted, found not guilty, not guilty means guilty now or not guilty means well
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:22.080]  you're still guilty and 2 plus 2 equals 5,000 and the Easter Bunny's real and so is Santa
[1:22:22.080 --> 1:22:23.080]  Claus.
[1:22:23.080 --> 1:22:29.440]  I mean it's unbelievable but we should all be asking what's the next big fiasco going
[1:22:29.440 --> 1:22:32.440]  to be?
[1:22:32.440 --> 1:22:35.360]  You go but it'll make Democrats look like fools to have a new impeachment, they said
[1:22:35.360 --> 1:22:40.640]  they are going to do it probably before the election with 266 days left and the fiasco
[1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:47.240]  in Iowa and then trying to steal it from Bernie Sanders again but doesn't that scare
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:49.400]  the hell out of you?
[1:22:49.400 --> 1:22:59.240]  The Democratic Party once a died in the wall communist that actually said there's too many
[1:22:59.240 --> 1:23:04.400]  choices at the grocery store, there's, I've played the video before, there's video of
[1:23:04.400 --> 1:23:24.720]  him saying there are too many choices at the grocery store, there's too much, we need lines.
[1:23:24.720 --> 1:23:29.240]  We've tried communism everywhere, it's a disaster but we've got a big crop of millennials
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:34.520]  that have been promised they're going to be commanders in it.
[1:23:34.520 --> 1:23:39.160]  There's a place for them running things, they can't run their own lives but they're going
[1:23:39.160 --> 1:23:45.880]  to run ours, don't, don't you worry they're going to start right off at the top.
[1:23:45.880 --> 1:23:52.800]  There it is, we don't need 23 choices of the older and 18 choices of sneakers when kids
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:23:56.520]  are going hungry.
[1:23:56.520 --> 1:24:02.120]  Everybody know that more choice means more and that people in the west go hungry less
[1:24:02.120 --> 1:24:12.760]  than anyone else and his model of Venezuela has over 1500 people a week starving to death.
[1:24:12.760 --> 1:24:22.120]  It does not matter, he has bozo hair and when you have bozo hair you know best.
[1:24:22.120 --> 1:24:30.320]  All right, I'm going to stop it right now, Craig Hayden, Presley Levi Schmig, Chris
[1:24:30.320 --> 1:24:43.560]  Debbie, CJ, who should we talk to first, let's talk to Presley in North Carolina, Presley
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:45.560]  you're on the air, welcome.
[1:24:45.560 --> 1:24:50.520]  Hey Alex, Greg to talk to you, God bless you, always praying for you in the country.
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:51.520]  Thank you.
[1:24:51.520 --> 1:24:55.560]  I've been listening to you since I found you on sacred count, ebons were open about 20
[1:24:55.560 --> 1:24:56.560]  years ago.
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:24:57.560]  That's how long I've been listening to you.
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:00.120]  Wow, you've been putting that with me for a while brother.
[1:25:00.120 --> 1:25:05.040]  Yeah man, when you used to hang out with Rogan and Stan Ho, turn my brother on to you too.
[1:25:05.040 --> 1:25:09.680]  So I just wanted to bring up how it's funny that the protest for freedom in Hong Kong
[1:25:09.680 --> 1:25:10.960]  stopped because of the virus.
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:17.960]  I wonder if that was somehow a part of it, say that again, how the protest for freedom
[1:25:17.960 --> 1:25:21.000]  democracy and freedom in Hong Kong stopped because of this virus.
[1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:27.200]  So yeah, they've definitely used it as a way to clamp down rebellion all over China.
[1:25:27.200 --> 1:25:31.640]  China lost the economic war with us, their economy's falling apart, then they have negative
[1:25:31.640 --> 1:25:36.960]  growth all of a sudden, and this is a perfect face saving reset for China, I totally agree
[1:25:36.960 --> 1:25:37.960]  with you.
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:42.840]  Yeah, and just also my other point is just people are so sick of the crap coming out
[1:25:42.840 --> 1:25:47.100]  of Hollywood that a foreign film went best picture and best foreign film and best director
[1:25:47.100 --> 1:25:48.600]  last night.
[1:25:48.600 --> 1:25:53.400]  Absolutely, people just hate Hollywood.
[1:25:53.400 --> 1:25:57.000]  Clearly China is using this for power and control and we're going to find out the death
[1:25:57.000 --> 1:26:01.520]  rates of all these people that have contracted it, it certainly spreads fast, that's confirmed
[1:26:01.520 --> 1:26:02.520]  now.
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:07.040]  We're going to find out on these cruise ships with 60 sick here, 50 sick here, 200 sick there.
[1:26:07.040 --> 1:26:11.480]  We're going to find out real quick the morbidity rate and I hope it's super low, in fact I
[1:26:11.480 --> 1:26:12.480]  hope it's zero.
[1:26:12.480 --> 1:26:16.040]  What are you predicting it's going to be?
[1:26:16.040 --> 1:26:19.520]  I'm hoping it's going to be low, but like my brother told me, I don't know where he
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:23.400]  got this from with thought of it, they said just remember don't pop any bubble wrap because
[1:26:23.400 --> 1:26:27.000]  all that air comes from China.
[1:26:27.000 --> 1:26:30.560]  Another good point because this virus lives a long time, what do you think of Joaquin
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:36.040]  Phoenix knowing the only way for him to be popular is to say Hollywood sucks, we're all
[1:26:36.040 --> 1:26:37.040]  parasites.
[1:26:37.040 --> 1:26:43.920]  He's just a loser and hopefully they finally shut him up by finally giving him an Oscar.
[1:26:43.920 --> 1:26:50.160]  Maybe he got one, yeah, but I mean just think about how even he gets, I suck, I apologize,
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:53.880]  by the way we're all scum, we're all parasites, I haven't played the clip yet, it's like yeah
[1:26:53.880 --> 1:26:55.000]  exactly.
[1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:59.160]  The only way he knows people are watching him is to say I know you hate me, exactly.
[1:26:59.160 --> 1:27:06.480]  He does that little, you know, fake, delicate genius act, big, any moron could, yeah he's
[1:27:06.480 --> 1:27:11.840]  always laying on the sympathy of his brother, you know, I mean just listen, anybody could
[1:27:11.840 --> 1:27:18.240]  sit there and put on the delicate genius autistic act that maybe I'll host the whole hour is
[1:27:18.240 --> 1:27:19.240]  Joaquin Phoenix.
[1:27:19.240 --> 1:27:25.080]  I mean he does one acting, oh man, I'd love to see you in the joker makeup again, dude.
[1:27:25.080 --> 1:27:30.520]  I love to get a ring of Joaquin Phoenix with baseball bats is what I like, I'll show him
[1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:32.520]  the Joker for real.
[1:27:32.520 --> 1:27:38.480]  God bless you Alex, keep up the good fight man.
[1:27:38.480 --> 1:27:41.920]  Alright, God bless you brother, I appreciate you calling, sorry I shouldn't talk like that,
[1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:48.240]  give me a word, Jesus please help me.
[1:27:48.240 --> 1:27:52.760]  That whole movie is about causing riots and death and killing police, that's why all
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:57.280]  the cops just got shot in New York in the last few days, and we just got two more cops
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:02.200]  shot just now in a Walmart in Arkansas, and that whole movie is about an uprising starting
[1:28:02.200 --> 1:28:06.080]  in the trains, and leftist groups funded by Soros have been trying to take the trains
[1:28:06.080 --> 1:28:10.960]  over and have riots that ended up bringing down New York with that communist mayor de
[1:28:10.960 --> 1:28:12.200]  Blasio behind it.
[1:28:12.200 --> 1:28:16.680]  I mean these people are disgusting jokes, doesn't mean the cops are perfect, no they're just
[1:28:16.680 --> 1:28:20.880]  like us, they got problems, they got good things about them, bad things.
[1:28:20.880 --> 1:28:26.640]  But the foreign multinational powers are trying to foam in a race war and the takedown of
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:31.640]  local government, and so the communists can come in and take over, and I got news for
[1:28:31.640 --> 1:28:35.760]  you, bunch of you jokers want to run around and really get a war start and start killing
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:41.040]  people, and civilization breaks down, you're going to wish there were police, believe me,
[1:28:41.040 --> 1:28:45.480]  because there are a lot of people who don't want to be violent who are trying to fix things,
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:51.240]  but believe me, if there's ever a civil war and breakdown and anarchy, you leftists are
[1:28:51.240 --> 1:28:58.040]  in a world that you know what, you people are a joke.

[1:29:03.080 --> 1:29:06.840]  Like you, I was a prisoner of the out left sanctuary state, until one day I chose to

[1:29:58.760 --> 1:30:03.240]  Most all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food, but I know for a fact
[1:30:03.240 --> 1:30:08.000]  from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it, get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:09.680]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[1:30:09.680 --> 1:30:14.120]  I've been on radio for 25 years, I've had storeable food for a long time, and I learned
[1:30:14.120 --> 1:30:18.400]  very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis
[1:30:18.400 --> 1:30:22.400]  they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[1:30:22.400 --> 1:30:27.080]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company
[1:30:27.080 --> 1:30:30.440]  out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it on
[1:30:30.440 --> 1:30:33.440]  hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say
[1:30:33.440 --> 1:30:36.600]  they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're
[1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:37.600]  good people.
[1:30:37.600 --> 1:30:40.480]  Now they were selling seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food, but
[1:30:40.480 --> 1:30:42.520]  they've got a package at record level orders.
[1:30:42.520 --> 1:30:47.280]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:51.400]  So get your orders at infowarstore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first, they're
[1:30:51.400 --> 1:30:55.280]  in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the info as well, so get prepared
[1:30:55.280 --> 1:31:01.040]  at infowarstore.com with storeable foods.
[1:31:01.040 --> 1:31:07.600]  Cobra Commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not
[1:31:07.600 --> 1:31:14.720]  get sunshine, and to not love Jesus, and of course do not get storeable foods or any other
[1:31:14.720 --> 1:31:22.160]  types of colloidal nanosilver at infowarstore.com, do not do it.
[1:31:22.160 --> 1:31:30.000]  See you then, trust in SNBC, drink fluoridated water, just like the loving kiss of a king
[1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:38.680]  cobra, pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients in their body, hug the cobra, love
[1:31:38.680 --> 1:31:50.120]  the cobra, kiss the cobra, but never, never go to infowar.com or infowarstore.com, do not
[1:31:50.120 --> 1:31:58.640]  get ordered on products silent, don't sell it.
[1:31:58.640 --> 1:32:02.920]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who infowars.
[1:32:02.920 --> 1:32:08.640]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:13.680]  corporate tyranny, has really caught hold, not just here in the US but worldwide, and
[1:32:13.680 --> 1:32:19.200]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[1:32:19.200 --> 1:32:24.600]  amazing as well, he's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against
[1:32:24.600 --> 1:32:28.680]  that in some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out
[1:32:28.680 --> 1:32:34.160]  against communist China, Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we
[1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:39.800]  really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective, and the globalists
[1:32:39.800 --> 1:32:44.960]  are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way, and so we're going to see some
[1:32:44.960 --> 1:32:50.280]  major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see
[1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:55.520]  all the poison they spray at us, that's an attempt to demoralize us, we've got to remember
[1:32:55.520 --> 1:33:01.640]  that and stay focused and stay happy.
[1:33:01.640 --> 1:33:23.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show, live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex
[1:33:23.440 --> 1:33:46.560]  Jones, I sure did, I got no friends, because they read the papers, back then though, if
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:51.600]  the newspapers were attacking you, you must be bad, now the newspapers attack you, you
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:34:04.640]  must be good, actually I am super nice now, so good to be attacked by a bunch of lion
[1:34:04.640 --> 1:34:11.840]  scum in the pedophile networks, because the thinking people see right through it and have
[1:34:11.840 --> 1:34:16.160]  stood with us, and I'm just so proud of the people, not just the United States, but of
[1:34:16.160 --> 1:34:21.320]  the world that are throwing off the globalists right now, and it's just going to get even
[1:34:21.320 --> 1:34:32.880]  more amazing in the future, I got no friends, because they read the papers with me, okay
[1:34:32.880 --> 1:34:39.080]  we're going to go back to your phone calls, we're getting serious here, you see how an
[1:34:39.080 --> 1:34:44.640]  authoritarian regime like the communist Chinese, the worst in history on record, highest kill
[1:34:44.640 --> 1:34:50.680]  rates, the most oppressive you name it, 400 million babies aborted, tens of millions
[1:34:50.680 --> 1:34:57.240]  after they're born, you see how they're using this to clamp down and control, and of all
[1:34:57.240 --> 1:35:05.840]  the macabre science fiction nightmare dystopia videos we've seen of people being shot at
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:11.160]  checkpoints and people being put in containment pods, there's new video up on info wars dot
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:25.080]  com, China, woman falls to her death trying to escape coronavirus quarantine, that's just
[1:35:25.080 --> 1:35:33.360]  absolutely hideous and so sad where they've boarded up, they've welded shut the buildings,
[1:35:33.360 --> 1:35:38.520]  and now this woman wants out, may I run out of food, run out of medication, who knows,
[1:35:38.520 --> 1:35:47.880]  and she's up there trying to climb, but loses her grip, didn't mean to die, and she falls
[1:35:47.880 --> 1:35:57.480]  to her death, well at least you know, she didn't feel much falling, looks like at least
[1:35:57.480 --> 1:36:06.920]  eight stories, you ever seen that famous black and white photo, see if you guys can pull
[1:36:06.920 --> 1:36:11.520]  it up, photo of woman who jumped off in part states building, it's black and white photo,
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:19.880]  it's old 50s car, beautiful woman, still got her lipstick on, cars all crushed, now if you
[1:36:19.880 --> 1:36:23.200]  hit the concrete, you splatter everywhere, you don't look pretty like that, so if you
[1:36:23.200 --> 1:36:28.280]  want to look pretty, you got to do it on top of you know, car, cars are so cheap now, you
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:32.280]  probably go right through it, but that was an old steel car, kind of did like a trampoline
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:43.800]  for her, but she did die, there it is, boyfriend broke up with her, she wasn't too happy, oh
[1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:50.680]  you're pretty feet, everything, that's so tragic, never kill yourself over a lost love,
[1:36:50.680 --> 1:36:58.560]  better to go out and selflessly serve the innocent, you want to kill yourself, give
[1:36:58.560 --> 1:37:05.680]  everything over, standing up for what's right, don't make it so easy for the devil, the guilty
[1:37:05.680 --> 1:37:12.800]  of things you've done, do the right thing and pay God back, I was only looking at your
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:22.800]  heart on what you've done, God's seen a few things, a little more than just a few things,
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:29.080]  we're going to go to your phone calls now, but that woman, fallen to her death trying
[1:37:29.080 --> 1:37:33.200]  to escape coronavirus, is now the most shocking video of a list of just unbelievable videos
[1:37:33.200 --> 1:37:43.280]  here, see this isn't a Netflix series, this is the real world, alright let's go to your
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:54.480]  phone calls, Kristen Illinois, thanks for holding her on the air worldwide, go ahead
[1:37:54.480 --> 1:37:55.480]  sir.
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:58.840]  Hey Alex, you know, make no mistake, it's not what they're cooking up, it's what they've
[1:37:58.840 --> 1:38:07.120]  already cooked up, just as Adam Schiff, as the Russia hoax imploded already had the impeachment
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:08.120]  stuff lined up.
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:10.800]  Exactly, so have we gotten any hint, because I'm trying to find out what it's going to
[1:38:10.800 --> 1:38:11.800]  be.
[1:38:11.800 --> 1:38:19.240]  Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of with you, I think it's going to be, you know, some of the recycled
[1:38:19.240 --> 1:38:26.120]  stuff, but I think they gain ground with their base when they use lawfare, you know, and
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:29.520]  I would be interested to see what Robert Barnes has to say.
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:35.600]  Oh yeah, they're funding massive lawsuits, they filed a bunch more against Trump, so yeah,
[1:38:35.600 --> 1:38:38.720]  just harass the living hell out of him and his family.
[1:38:38.720 --> 1:38:43.000]  Well the other thing is, with the coronavirus, two weeks ago on Sunday night when Mike Adams
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:48.320]  put the article out that pretty much described how this would exponentially expand, I sent
[1:38:48.320 --> 1:38:53.640]  that to three of my friends who are physicians, one of them was, you know, bought into it,
[1:38:53.640 --> 1:38:59.400]  two of them were, you know, in their position over educated humorous sort of scoff at the
[1:38:59.400 --> 1:39:04.640]  whole idea, however, on Friday I talked to one of them, he said, this is crazy, I sent
[1:39:04.640 --> 1:39:10.640]  him the Dr. Boyle interview you had and also the other interview that was done previously
[1:39:10.640 --> 1:39:17.400]  by that other outlet and we had a long conversation for about an hour and he said, you know, he
[1:39:17.400 --> 1:39:20.000]  didn't apologize that he was like, man, you're right.
[1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:28.600]  And so I think when you get, you know, the physicians and the intellectual people involved
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:33.960]  with this and buying into it, there's no way that this can be hidden any longer, I don't
[1:39:33.960 --> 1:39:34.960]  think.
[1:39:34.960 --> 1:39:39.880]  Well, I'll say this, Band-Aid video is really exploding, so the listeners are doing a great
[1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:43.200]  job getting the videos out.
[1:39:43.200 --> 1:39:48.880]  We're getting four or five, six million views a day now on Band-Aid video that really pisses
[1:39:48.880 --> 1:39:52.440]  Google off in the establishment, they thought they would silence everybody, but they have
[1:39:52.440 --> 1:39:54.320]  not silenced you, so keep it up.
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:59.600]  But yes, Dr. Boyle said on Friday the White House should investigate this is man-made.
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:02.800]  Hours later they made that announcement and I asked him to come back on, he said he will
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:09.680]  in a few days when he has more to say, but just unbelievable how obvious it is, this
[1:40:09.680 --> 1:40:10.680]  is engineered.
[1:40:10.680 --> 1:40:14.520]  Do you think they accidentally released it or is Xi Jinping releasing it as a way to
[1:40:14.520 --> 1:40:19.400]  save face and cover up the fact they just lost a trade war with the United States?
[1:40:19.400 --> 1:40:25.000]  Well, I mean, look at who benefits like you were saying, whether it was accidentally released
[1:40:25.000 --> 1:40:32.080]  or done on purpose, it benefits their, you know, social credit score, top-down control
[1:40:32.080 --> 1:40:33.080]  system.
[1:40:33.080 --> 1:40:37.680]  So, either way, they win and it also does help them save face because they're getting
[1:40:37.680 --> 1:40:41.840]  their ass kicked, you know, right now economically.
[1:40:41.840 --> 1:40:46.360]  One other thing I wanted to mention, Alex, is about, you know, several years ago you
[1:40:46.360 --> 1:40:51.880]  guys played this video, it's called Chicago Unchained, well, I'm on the ground in Chicago,
[1:40:51.880 --> 1:40:56.520]  I get down to the produce market very early, I'm in the food sales business, and one of
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:40:59.840]  my friends I've been friends with for about 10 years, a black guy, he has a concealed
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:03.720]  carry, he's a Trump supporter, and he's trying to get me an interview with one of the guys
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:09.800]  in that Chicago Unchained video, and essentially what he's telling me is the black community
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:17.400]  here in Chicago, he believes there's a lot, a lot of Trump supporters, the problem is
[1:41:17.400 --> 1:41:20.920]  they can't really be that vocal about it within their community because it's kind of a safe
[1:41:20.920 --> 1:41:22.920]  face situation.
[1:41:22.920 --> 1:41:28.240]  Additionally, I was at a Super Bowl party, my buddy right down the street, he's Mexican,
[1:41:28.240 --> 1:41:34.360]  second generation, and out of the 20 people there, half of the guys there who were all
[1:41:34.360 --> 1:41:39.600]  Mexican, I was the only white guy, about half of those guys were Trump supporters and had
[1:41:39.600 --> 1:41:44.520]  long conversations with them, and they're, you know, I feel like the Hispanic community
[1:41:44.520 --> 1:41:46.640]  is almost a built-in Trump supporter.
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:49.640]  Oh yeah, that's it, I mean that's it.
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:54.160]  No one's buying the Trump's Erases thing, the hoax failed, so mainstream media's hoax
[1:41:54.160 --> 1:41:58.440]  failed, so what are they going to pull next then?
[1:41:58.440 --> 1:42:06.840]  Well, I mean, they do have to ratchet up the, you know, the race fading and the, you know,
[1:42:06.840 --> 1:42:10.600]  possibly a deep fake with, you know, like Tom Arnold was saying, you know, something
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:11.600]  that...
[1:42:11.600 --> 1:42:14.400]  Exactly, but I buy in a rough, you were getting back to the Hispanic community, built-in
[1:42:14.400 --> 1:42:15.400]  Trump support.
[1:42:15.400 --> 1:42:20.960]  Oh yeah, they, they, you know, they're pro-family, they're concerned about MS-13, you know,
[1:42:20.960 --> 1:42:26.600]  here in Chicago we have the Pilson neighborhood, which is probably 50,000 Hispanics, it's very
[1:42:26.600 --> 1:42:34.640]  large, it's right, it's just west of Chinatown, if you look at a map of Chicago, and what
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:39.440]  I'm saying though is through talking to those guys, I was surprised that he, in his view,
[1:42:39.440 --> 1:42:44.560]  and he lives right there, just like the black community, you know, my friends that I was
[1:42:44.560 --> 1:42:45.560]  talking to...
[1:42:45.560 --> 1:42:48.480]  No, no, I hear you, I gotta jump, Chris, thank you, more calls for it ahead, but listen,
[1:42:48.480 --> 1:42:50.840]  the Democrats are done, nobody likes them.
[1:42:50.840 --> 1:42:54.880]  That's why they have election fraud though, no one is electing them, I'm telling you,
[1:42:54.880 --> 1:42:57.720]  I'm telling you, they have control of the cities though.
[1:42:57.720 --> 1:43:02.240]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts
[1:43:02.240 --> 1:43:04.080]  to crack and take damage.

[1:44:57.080 --> 1:45:04.080]  It was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the morning
[1:45:04.080 --> 1:45:07.040]  and said, son, you've got to see this.
[1:45:07.040 --> 1:45:10.800]  The company that holds the patents on the nano-silver that's in our toothpaste, that's
[1:45:10.800 --> 1:45:14.400]  in our immune garden, and that's in some of the other great products like the super-silver
[1:45:14.400 --> 1:45:21.640]  wound shell, had reports from back in 2007 with the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:27.880]  Security, with the director of Homeland Security, certifying an unrestricted document, confidential
[1:45:27.880 --> 1:45:32.640]  documents was noted as, that this had been proven in their secret test to be knocking
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:33.640]  out SARS.
[1:45:33.640 --> 1:45:38.640]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless, now they authorized us to talk about this.
[1:45:38.640 --> 1:45:40.720]  I talked about it on the show last week.
[1:45:40.720 --> 1:45:44.760]  Just hiding in plain view, this is a product that we had stockpiled and that we're still
[1:45:44.760 --> 1:45:49.280]  selling at 40% off or more with the combos so that you can get it in your hands.
[1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:52.960]  It's something that's good for everyday use, regardless, and it funds the operation.
[1:45:52.960 --> 1:45:56.680]  So infowarstore.com for your immune gargle and other products that contain this key
[1:45:56.680 --> 1:45:57.680]  nano-silver.
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:05.320]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and
[1:46:05.320 --> 1:46:08.400]  Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[1:46:08.400 --> 1:46:14.440]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media,
[1:46:14.440 --> 1:46:19.560]  but it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[1:46:19.560 --> 1:46:26.560]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:30.800]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[1:46:30.800 --> 1:46:37.000]  Anyone once we stage these attacks that does not blame it on Trump, will also be targeted
[1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:41.160]  by Cobra in the future.
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:48.080]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and
[1:46:48.080 --> 1:46:55.280]  then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[1:46:55.280 --> 1:47:13.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:13.680 --> 1:47:20.080]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:20.080 --> 1:47:25.400]  All right, I want to hurry through your calls, we'll continue to the next hour, but Robert
[1:47:25.400 --> 1:47:28.480]  Barnes has been on a while, he's going to be popping in to talk about the impeachment,
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:33.040]  how he thinks he'll strike back next, how he thinks the Republicans should strike back.
[1:47:33.040 --> 1:47:35.400]  Let's go to Debbie in Kentucky.
[1:47:35.400 --> 1:47:37.400]  Debbie, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:47:37.400 --> 1:47:38.400]  Welcome.
[1:47:38.400 --> 1:47:39.400]  Well, hi there, Alex.
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:40.400]  How are you doing today?
[1:47:40.400 --> 1:47:41.880]  I'm great talking to you.
[1:47:41.880 --> 1:47:46.920]  I've been listening to you for quite a while now, and you've really informed me on a lot
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:49.240]  of things, and I want to thank you for that.
[1:47:49.240 --> 1:47:54.120]  You've helped me up a long time ago with why I see things differently now.
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:56.720]  How did you originally find us, Debbie, and how long ago?
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:00.120]  Oh, God, it's been 15 years.
[1:48:00.120 --> 1:48:06.680]  I don't even remember how, but I know when I thought I'd lost you, it kind of sent me
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:11.840]  into a panic, so that's another story, but it's like, okay, where am I going to get the
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:12.840]  truth from now?
[1:48:12.840 --> 1:48:13.840]  So...
[1:48:13.840 --> 1:48:18.320]  See, we're listening to us one way and it went away, but you ended up finding another
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:19.320]  way to hear us.
[1:48:19.320 --> 1:48:20.320]  Right.
[1:48:20.320 --> 1:48:25.320]  Well, yeah, I've changed state, so in Chicago area, there was a lot of ways to listen to
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:26.320]  you.
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:27.320]  That's right.
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:28.320]  We've always had audiences.
[1:48:28.320 --> 1:48:31.440]  Chicago, we always have a station or two up there.
[1:48:31.440 --> 1:48:34.920]  They're always changing, but, yeah, Chicago's always been good folks to us.
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:35.920]  Right.
[1:48:35.920 --> 1:48:38.440]  It changes, and then it's trying, you know, it's finding you again.
[1:48:38.440 --> 1:48:44.440]  That's half the battle, so, and then now, you know, now they're trying to kick you off,
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:51.120]  so finding you again is another, is another hard thing to do, but, you know...
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:56.920]  Well, that's why I'm not bragging, but our audience, our listeners, our crew, our guests,
[1:48:56.920 --> 1:49:00.080]  we're the real McCoy, and, you know, you just don't find four-leaf clover's everywhere
[1:49:00.080 --> 1:49:05.440]  because the enemy doesn't want people to have access to it because it's too successful.
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:08.800]  Everywhere we're put on a radio station, they'll put us on the station with almost no ratings.
[1:49:08.800 --> 1:49:12.480]  We'll go to number one or number two within one year, but then someone always comes in
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:14.720]  and leases it or buys it to get me off.
[1:49:14.720 --> 1:49:15.720]  It's crazy.
[1:49:15.720 --> 1:49:17.840]  Well, you're posting the truth.
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:22.640]  I mean, they make fun of you, but how many times have you been wrong?
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:25.800]  That, that, I mean, that's what it comes...
[1:49:25.800 --> 1:49:31.160]  CNN, the alphabet soups like that, they're always wrong, but how many times with your
[1:49:31.160 --> 1:49:35.760]  information have you been wrong?
[1:49:35.760 --> 1:49:37.920]  That's the whole point, and that's why people come back.
[1:49:37.920 --> 1:49:39.720]  They know you're not going to lie to them.
[1:49:39.720 --> 1:49:40.720]  You're not going to, you know...
[1:49:40.720 --> 1:49:43.040]  Hey, if I don't know, I don't know.
[1:49:43.040 --> 1:49:47.760]  That's what you say, you know, but this is what I think is what it looks like.
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:50.240]  You give us the facts, and that's all people want nowadays.
[1:49:50.240 --> 1:49:53.480]  Well, I appreciate you putting up with me, Debbie.
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:54.800]  What's your view on the coronavirus?
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:49:57.240]  Oh, well, see, that's the whole point.
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:00.200]  You know, I've been listening to you for a while, and I'm wondering why you haven't
[1:50:00.200 --> 1:50:05.040]  practiced irons up there to this prominent reason, called AlphaGal.
[1:50:05.040 --> 1:50:06.040]  Say that again?
[1:50:06.040 --> 1:50:11.600]  There's this thing called AlphaGal that's relatively new.
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:12.600]  There's...
[1:50:12.600 --> 1:50:18.000]  I mean, here, it's from Mississippi over to the East Coast, we're covered in it.
[1:50:18.000 --> 1:50:21.480]  I mean, it's patients are popping up left and right.
[1:50:21.480 --> 1:50:29.280]  Coronavirus is bad, but AlphaGal makes you allergic to red meat, pork, lamb.
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:38.440]  Ma'am, I do know about people now having allergic responses to me, and I have read about that.
[1:50:38.440 --> 1:50:41.440]  I wasn't understanding what you were talking about at first.
[1:50:41.440 --> 1:50:46.800]  We're becoming totally allergic to our own environment, because mainly the vaccines have
[1:50:46.800 --> 1:50:51.920]  so many contaminants that your body then has an autoimmune response to all of those, and
[1:50:51.920 --> 1:50:53.920]  a lot of them are grown on red meat.
[1:50:53.920 --> 1:50:58.320]  Also, a lot of vaccines now have the whole human genome in them, so then you're becoming
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:03.480]  allergic to your own human genome, but even if you're not taking the vaccines, when you
[1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:08.560]  eat GMO crops, your body has an autoimmune response to that, and then it starts having
[1:51:08.560 --> 1:51:11.960]  an autoimmune response to everything else, so yes, ma'am, I am aware of it, give us your
[1:51:11.960 --> 1:51:12.960]  view on it.
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:13.960]  No, no, no.
[1:51:13.960 --> 1:51:15.560]  You're talking something totally different.
[1:51:15.560 --> 1:51:20.560]  Now, you brought me to the light with the vaccines and all, no, this is from a tick
[1:51:20.560 --> 1:51:21.560]  site.
[1:51:21.560 --> 1:51:30.480]  This is a disease you get from a tick site, and it makes you allergic, and it's brand
[1:51:30.480 --> 1:51:31.480]  new out.
[1:51:31.480 --> 1:51:32.800]  I mean, it's not 10 years?
[1:51:32.800 --> 1:51:35.000]  No, ma'am, I've seen it.
[1:51:35.000 --> 1:51:36.960]  They claim people think it's spread by ticks.
[1:51:36.960 --> 1:51:44.040]  I'm not sure that's the case, but what I'm explaining is a lot of these vaccines have
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:49.840]  a whole human genome in it, so then your body has an autoimmune response to a human
[1:51:49.840 --> 1:51:51.840]  genome.
[1:51:51.840 --> 1:51:54.200]  Well, you're going to have autoimmune responses to anything even close to you, and what are
[1:51:54.200 --> 1:51:55.200]  we very close to?
[1:51:55.200 --> 1:51:57.320]  Pigs and things like that.
[1:51:57.320 --> 1:52:00.320]  It's just, I never heard about this.
[1:52:00.320 --> 1:52:05.120]  I didn't know anything until a neighbor down the street got it, and I started looking into
[1:52:05.120 --> 1:52:06.120]  it.
[1:52:06.120 --> 1:52:10.520]  It's like, whoa, I mean, it's mainly on the East Coast, too, from the Midwest to East.
[1:52:10.520 --> 1:52:15.760]  No, ma'am, listen, you know most of the time what they tell you is doing something, it's
[1:52:15.760 --> 1:52:16.760]  something else.
[1:52:16.760 --> 1:52:18.640]  We are creating a toxic environment.
[1:52:18.640 --> 1:52:21.120]  The environmentalists tell us it's carbon dioxide we've got to deal with.
[1:52:21.120 --> 1:52:22.560]  No, that's what plants breathe.
[1:52:22.560 --> 1:52:28.200]  But all the GMO and all of that, that's what's crazy, and that's what's causing chain reactions,
[1:52:28.200 --> 1:52:33.480]  and then now all these new vaccines have live, whole, genetically engineered viruses that
[1:52:33.480 --> 1:52:35.920]  shed and mutate.
[1:52:35.920 --> 1:52:42.320]  There is genetic sequencing of common vaccine finds entire male human genome from a boarded
[1:52:42.320 --> 1:52:49.960]  human baby, a complete individual at Science News, with abnormal modified genes, 560 genes
[1:52:49.960 --> 1:52:50.960]  linked together.
[1:52:50.960 --> 1:52:55.560]  And that's scary, isn't it?
[1:52:55.560 --> 1:53:01.720]  Ma'am, think about it, if you take tetanus, the U.N. got caught in 96 by Indian scientists,
[1:53:01.720 --> 1:53:06.160]  it was all confirmed, adding a female hormone that's only released at the beginning of the
[1:53:06.160 --> 1:53:09.760]  second trimester and part of developing the baby.
[1:53:09.760 --> 1:53:14.440]  If you add it to tetanus, the body that has an autoimmune response every time to that
[1:53:14.440 --> 1:53:20.080]  and then attacks the baby and causes an abortion, then because your ovaries are releasing it,
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:24.160]  the body that attacks the ovaries, and then you have an autoimmune response and have all
[1:53:24.160 --> 1:53:28.560]  sorts of system problems, that's the kind of crap they do, and that's just adding a
[1:53:28.560 --> 1:53:30.160]  hormone to a shot.
[1:53:30.160 --> 1:53:36.440]  Who the hell knows what they're doing now because they can edit it right into the RNA
[1:53:36.440 --> 1:53:40.720]  and DNA, and even universities have trouble picking it up.
[1:53:40.720 --> 1:53:41.720]  Isn't that incredible?
[1:53:41.720 --> 1:53:45.960]  Well, how about the high estrogen, the least male-incredible burger?
[1:53:45.960 --> 1:53:52.240]  Oh, yeah, the so-called incredible burger, a man might as well just put his testicles
[1:53:52.240 --> 1:53:56.080]  in a wood chipper if he takes it, and a woman high estrogen on top of what it will give
[1:53:56.080 --> 1:53:58.120]  you, as you know, all sorts of cancer.
[1:53:58.120 --> 1:53:59.120]  God bless you.
[1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:01.240]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[1:54:01.240 --> 1:54:10.560]  Burger King's Impossible burger has 44 milligrams of pathogenic estrogen compared to regular
[1:54:10.560 --> 1:54:14.160]  burger of 2.5 of phytoestrogen.
[1:54:14.160 --> 1:54:19.360]  I call it pathogenic, which means it spreads, but it's really, it's just all insane.
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:24.680]  Doctors say high estrogen and Burger King's Impossible will grow breast on men.
[1:54:24.680 --> 1:54:25.680]  I just can't handle it.
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:26.760]  Thank you so much.
[1:54:26.760 --> 1:54:27.760]  Great caller.
[1:54:27.760 --> 1:54:29.360]  I say I can take a bunch of calls.
[1:54:29.360 --> 1:54:33.080]  These calls are all so good, though, you get a lot of time here, and I appreciate you.
[1:54:33.080 --> 1:54:36.600]  Who's up next here?
[1:54:36.600 --> 1:54:37.600]  Jonathan in Florida.
[1:54:37.600 --> 1:54:39.720]  I'm glad you're calling about this.
[1:54:39.720 --> 1:54:43.840]  Imagine if a Republican ran into a tent and ran over six people, you never hear the end
[1:54:43.840 --> 1:54:48.240]  of it, like one poor person happened in Virginia, Charlottesville, but almost no coverage of
[1:54:48.240 --> 1:54:49.720]  what happened, Jonathan.
[1:54:49.720 --> 1:54:52.120]  Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:53.600]  I've listened to you for a long time.
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:54.800]  I won't keep you for long.
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:55.800]  Oh, please, go on.
[1:54:55.800 --> 1:54:56.800]  All the callers are so great.
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:05.560]  They keep going up with great talking points to contemplate about, but back to what happened
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:12.720]  here recently, I guess the point I wanted to make was the people that we're dealing
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:18.320]  with are not Democrats at this point.
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:20.600]  They are a creation of the Democrat Party.
[1:55:20.600 --> 1:55:26.640]  The Democrat Party has created them for the last 50 years, and the ideology that these
[1:55:26.640 --> 1:55:33.680]  people have invested in can only lead to this type of violence, which took place here in
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:40.880]  a blue-collar conservative town like Jacksonville just a few days ago.
[1:55:40.880 --> 1:55:44.800]  Like you were saying, imagine a Republican doing that.
[1:55:44.800 --> 1:55:46.480]  You would never hear the end of it.
[1:55:46.480 --> 1:55:53.200]  It would be the CNN, MSNBC talking point for the next year and a half.
[1:55:53.200 --> 1:56:00.960]  So, the sides are definitely skewed, but there is only one place that these people will go
[1:56:00.960 --> 1:56:03.520]  to, and it's going to be violence.
[1:56:03.520 --> 1:56:06.520]  They are radicals.
[1:56:06.520 --> 1:56:11.320]  They are communist, and they say they're going to overthrow, and they're going to kill anybody
[1:56:11.320 --> 1:56:14.960]  that doesn't submit to them, and just like the guy that went to kill all the members
[1:56:14.960 --> 1:56:19.400]  of the Republican baseball team, and CNN said the guy was a hero.
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:25.120]  He's not a monster, he was attacking what he believed was evil, and so that's who these
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:29.360]  people are, and that's what they're going to do, and you're absolutely right.
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:31.680]  What do we do about it?
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:36.720]  I think that we can't pull the first shot.
[1:56:36.720 --> 1:56:41.520]  We have to play defense here, but luckily we have a second amendment that protects us
[1:56:41.520 --> 1:56:47.800]  from it, and these clowns who are going to use cars, just to the audience, when you're
[1:56:47.800 --> 1:56:53.120]  going out in this campaign season of 2020, and you're going to vote, maybe you're going
[1:56:53.120 --> 1:56:59.640]  to go to a campaign rally, just be extremely cautious.
[1:56:59.640 --> 1:57:03.200]  Don't be, it's not to be too frightened, too afraid to go out.
[1:57:03.200 --> 1:57:05.200]  No, no, don't let them intimidate you.
[1:57:05.200 --> 1:57:08.880]  Come out in even bigger numbers, and come out packing, because thank God our founders
[1:57:08.880 --> 1:57:13.640]  saw a time when bullies would try something like this, and the answer is the second amendment
[1:57:13.640 --> 1:57:15.240]  to defend ourselves.
[1:57:15.240 --> 1:57:18.040]  Jonathan, great points, and God bless you.
[1:57:18.040 --> 1:57:20.480]  All right, that's it for this hour.
[1:57:20.480 --> 1:57:25.000]  Please don't forget, we sold out of the 16-ounce nano silver that's so good to counter the
[1:57:25.000 --> 1:57:28.600]  whole coronavirus family.
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:32.480]  We have the three-ounce left, it's selling out quickly, as well as the one-ounce that's
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:36.840]  selling out very, very quickly, and it's great to have regardable spray on your hands and
[1:57:36.840 --> 1:57:37.840]  body.
[1:57:37.840 --> 1:57:39.320]  You can also ingest it.
[1:57:39.320 --> 1:57:43.520]  It's at infowarstore.com, and the entire toothpaste line, both super blue and super
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:47.720]  silver tooth whitening have it in it, as well.
[1:57:47.720 --> 1:57:51.960]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste, because I hadn't tried it, except
[1:57:51.960 --> 1:57:56.480]  for maybe the last week and a half, and I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[1:57:56.480 --> 1:57:57.480]  I've ever tried.
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:57:59.520]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:01.360]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[1:58:01.360 --> 1:58:07.480]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste
[1:58:07.480 --> 1:58:12.200]  I've ever tried, and I'm 45 years old, and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste,
[1:58:12.200 --> 1:58:13.680]  and it's fluoride-free.
[1:58:13.680 --> 1:58:17.880]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium, because after
[1:58:17.880 --> 1:58:23.000]  I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean, and the toothpaste, I don't even rinse out
[1:58:23.000 --> 1:58:25.340]  my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[1:58:25.340 --> 1:58:26.640]  It feels so good.
[1:58:26.640 --> 1:58:30.800]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[1:58:30.800 --> 1:58:36.040]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[1:58:36.040 --> 1:58:48.880]  a day now, because I like the way it feels.
[1:58:48.880 --> 1:58:50.520]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[1:58:50.520 --> 1:58:52.680]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[1:58:52.680 --> 1:58:57.120]  I love all the other shows we do here, but I'll be honest with you, we run during the
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:01.640]  breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[1:59:01.640 --> 1:59:03.360]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[1:59:03.360 --> 1:59:04.360]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[1:59:04.360 --> 1:59:06.560]  But here's the bottom line.
[1:59:06.560 --> 1:59:09.680]  We're barely paying the bills here, and I want to expand in the face of the globalist
[1:59:09.680 --> 1:59:10.680]  not contract.
[1:59:10.680 --> 1:59:11.840]  I don't want them to win.
[1:59:11.840 --> 1:59:14.760]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[1:59:14.760 --> 1:59:19.320]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs, and we'll expand and really
[1:59:19.320 --> 1:59:21.080]  give the globalists a run for their money.
[1:59:21.080 --> 1:59:25.360]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2, these will
[1:59:25.360 --> 1:59:26.360]  change your life.
[1:59:26.360 --> 1:59:29.880]  Go check out the turmeric products, check out the water filtration, air filtration, check
[1:59:29.880 --> 1:59:30.880]  it all out.
[1:59:30.880 --> 1:59:34.920]  So take action and know, be part of the Second American Revolution, be part of Crush the
[1:59:34.920 --> 1:59:37.480]  Globalist, and get great products at the same time.
[1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:39.920]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[1:59:39.920 --> 1:59:41.960]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[1:59:41.960 --> 1:59:52.120]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[1:59:52.120 --> 2:00:08.040]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:35.560]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes is going to be joining us coming up on Continue
[2:00:35.560 --> 2:00:40.440]  with Craig and Hayden and Levi and Smig and Eric and Neil and CJ and all of you right
[2:00:40.440 --> 2:00:43.440]  into the fourth hour today.
[2:00:43.440 --> 2:00:47.640]  We also have the video that's up on Infowars.com, Attorney General Barr takes on human trafficking
[2:00:47.640 --> 2:00:50.360]  and child welfare system, we're going to get to that.
[2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:57.880]  Also video Pompeo sounds alarm over China's attempt to suppress free speech in America
[2:00:57.880 --> 2:00:58.880]  and so much more.
[2:00:58.880 --> 2:01:03.320]  But let me go ahead and go to this right now, ahead of Barnes joining us.
[2:01:03.320 --> 2:01:06.960]  It's a very important report.
[2:01:06.960 --> 2:01:09.600]  And it's clip four.
[2:01:09.600 --> 2:01:14.200]  It's the dawn of race specific bio warfare is upon us.
[2:01:14.200 --> 2:01:21.080]  Again, the dawn of race specific bio warfare is upon us.
[2:01:21.080 --> 2:01:32.880]  This bio attack is race specific, targeting specifically Chinese military age males and
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:38.640]  then almost all the people infected and almost all of those dying are males.
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:43.840]  That's hidden in the literature, the medical reports, and then you get the scan by the
[2:01:43.840 --> 2:01:53.000]  major Indian scientific gene splicing university and it's conclusive.
[2:01:53.000 --> 2:01:59.720]  And now other groups have looked at it and said, yeah, it's even got the insertion gene
[2:01:59.720 --> 2:02:07.440]  that you see with RNA and gene editing, where it was injected.
[2:02:07.440 --> 2:02:10.560]  There's signatures right there.
[2:02:10.560 --> 2:02:16.600]  So I'm not going to give the US government a pass and say for sure that somebody in the
[2:02:16.600 --> 2:02:22.960]  deep state on the American team in Pist and enough fentanyl being shipped in every couple
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:27.720]  months to kill the entire world population, you're like, that's what shipped into the
[2:02:27.720 --> 2:02:28.720]  US.
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:30.480]  Enough to kill the whole world.
[2:02:30.480 --> 2:02:36.080]  The massive bust Ohio Attorney General Dave Yo saying quote, the quantity of fentanyl
[2:02:36.080 --> 2:02:41.320]  in this case amounts to chemical warfare and a weapon of mass destruction.
[2:02:41.320 --> 2:02:45.440]  That's why you see homeless everywhere laying out asleep during the day asleep at night.
[2:02:45.440 --> 2:02:46.440]  They're not asleep.
[2:02:46.440 --> 2:02:47.840]  They're passed out on fentanyl.
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:52.080]  But you pull back from this and you think about what's going on in China.
[2:02:52.080 --> 2:02:55.800]  They need an excuse to clamp down on their political enemies away to unify the population
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:03:01.640]  under control, a way to get the world to endorse their tyranny, something Trump suddenly done
[2:03:01.640 --> 2:03:02.640]  that's wrong.
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:10.160]  You're like, oh, they would never kill millions of their military, it's called a balance.
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:16.040]  I did fall pregnant for a second time, Zhang Xinping tells me, but I had an abortion.
[2:03:16.040 --> 2:03:20.520]  Did you have a choice?
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:22.880]  I couldn't keep it, she replies.
[2:03:22.880 --> 2:03:26.960]  You either go willingly or the government comes for you.
[2:03:26.960 --> 2:03:28.680]  That's what the chai comms talk about.
[2:03:28.680 --> 2:03:29.680]  One child policy.
[2:03:29.680 --> 2:03:31.080]  This is even from Wikipedia.
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:34.360]  I don't just believe Wikipedia links through all the government sources.
[2:03:34.360 --> 2:03:40.560]  According to Chinese government, 400 million births have been prevented and tens of millions
[2:03:40.560 --> 2:03:43.520]  have been killed after they're born.
[2:03:43.520 --> 2:03:45.960]  China's sex ratio is out of whack.
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:50.120]  117.7 boys to every 100 girls.
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:53.600]  That means higher crime rates and fewer eligible brides.
[2:03:53.600 --> 2:04:00.480]  So if they'll kill 400 million people, mainly girls, will they release a race specific bioweapon
[2:04:00.480 --> 2:04:02.800]  only targeting military aged men?
[2:04:02.800 --> 2:04:07.680]  Yes, because they've done the demographics and they've got an internal problem because
[2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:16.200]  there's hundreds of millions of more men than women and they can't find women.
[2:04:16.200 --> 2:04:22.000]  First they took the girls away from you, then they let you get up to 30 years old or whatever,
[2:04:22.000 --> 2:04:25.840]  let you extinguish some of your energy, and now they're just going to kill you.
[2:04:25.840 --> 2:04:29.840]  The evidence mounts, this is a race specific bioweapon, well we know it's that.
[2:04:29.840 --> 2:04:34.360]  The evidence mounts that the chai comms launch this against themselves to save face about
[2:04:34.360 --> 2:04:40.360]  their economic collapse, their lost war with the U.S. and is a way to clamp down and control
[2:04:40.360 --> 2:04:41.360]  their population.
[2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:46.000]  I remember my grandfather going, they want us to have a nuclear war.
[2:04:46.000 --> 2:04:50.080]  The Chinese dictator, whoever it was after mal died, says he wants us to nuke them because
[2:04:50.080 --> 2:04:53.080]  they want to get rid of their population and they're the only group in the world that wants
[2:04:53.080 --> 2:04:54.080]  to get rid of them.
[2:04:54.080 --> 2:04:56.520]  That's why they fit into this.
[2:04:56.520 --> 2:04:57.520]  Don't be a victim.
[2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:01.680]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your
[2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:02.680]  immune system.
[2:05:02.680 --> 2:05:05.880]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down and you have plenty
[2:05:05.880 --> 2:05:06.880]  of hydration.
[2:05:06.880 --> 2:05:09.120]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[2:05:09.120 --> 2:05:13.040]  Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil, take your colloidal
[2:05:13.040 --> 2:05:17.800]  silver, all of it, that's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[2:05:17.800 --> 2:05:22.600]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver that's patented and
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:26.040]  documented and even admitted and documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona
[2:05:26.040 --> 2:05:27.040]  SARS family.
[2:05:27.040 --> 2:05:28.040]  A virus.
[2:05:28.040 --> 2:05:31.400]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles that'll be sold out a couple days
[2:05:31.400 --> 2:05:34.880]  and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[2:05:34.880 --> 2:05:36.080]  Great to have period.
[2:05:36.080 --> 2:05:37.080]  Really good for your gums.
[2:05:37.080 --> 2:05:38.080]  Really great for your teeth.
[2:05:38.080 --> 2:05:40.240]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[2:05:40.240 --> 2:05:43.680]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top
[2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:45.600]  nano tech company based here in the US.
[2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:48.920]  It's in only some way a security documents and everything because we get the best stuff
[2:05:48.920 --> 2:05:50.240]  and there's a lot of patriots.
[2:05:50.240 --> 2:05:54.000]  There's not just bad guys coming after us with the flip side of all the good guys and
[2:05:54.000 --> 2:05:55.000]  good gals.
[2:05:55.000 --> 2:06:09.000]  It's very exciting.
[2:06:09.000 --> 2:06:13.920]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide.
[2:06:13.920 --> 2:06:15.920]  It's Alex Jones.
[2:06:15.920 --> 2:06:22.120]  All right, we're taking calls this hour into the next and we've got constitutional lawyer
[2:06:22.120 --> 2:06:26.000]  Robert Barnes who's been really busy but has now been able to come on today.
[2:06:26.000 --> 2:06:29.680]  We really appreciate him coming on.
[2:06:29.680 --> 2:06:32.520]  We have the big headline up on info wars dot com.
[2:06:32.520 --> 2:06:35.200]  It's a big dredge report headline as well.
[2:06:35.200 --> 2:06:45.120]  Greenhouse Trump fires 70 Obama holdovers from National Security Council.
[2:06:45.120 --> 2:06:49.440]  That's a big news wars story up on info wars dot com as well.
[2:06:49.440 --> 2:06:54.160]  President Trump is reportedly removed over 70 Obama era holdovers from his staff, including
[2:06:54.160 --> 2:06:56.880]  the National Security Council.
[2:06:56.880 --> 2:06:58.000]  But that's not good enough.
[2:06:58.000 --> 2:07:02.720]  We need the neocons and the sorrows is removed.
[2:07:02.720 --> 2:07:07.800]  The purge comes after Trump fired Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vidman and his twin brother
[2:07:07.800 --> 2:07:15.400]  from the NSC Friday along with Ambassador to Ukraine Gordon Sondland for their insubordinate
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:20.000]  roles as witnesses in the Democrat impeachment campaign that failed last week.
[2:07:20.000 --> 2:07:32.080]  And now they're trying to say him firing people is a violation.
[2:07:32.080 --> 2:07:40.680]  They're now saying that the president doesn't have the power to fire people that leak disinformation.
[2:07:40.680 --> 2:07:42.280]  They don't just leak.
[2:07:42.280 --> 2:07:47.520]  They leak disinformation from a separate branch of government.
[2:07:47.520 --> 2:07:54.960]  Imagine if President Trump had a communist Chinese spy running his operations like Diane
[2:07:54.960 --> 2:07:55.960]  Feinstein.
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:08:00.080]  The Democratic Party by its very nature is a traitorous organization.
[2:08:00.080 --> 2:08:07.480]  Now it's not a party, it's an international cabal of criminals.
[2:08:07.480 --> 2:08:08.680]  And so Robert Barnes joins us.
[2:08:08.680 --> 2:08:10.160]  I want to cover the waterfront with him.
[2:08:10.160 --> 2:08:11.160]  Great to have him back.
[2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:15.000]  I want to look at what happened in the impeachment, what he saw with the trial, how he thinks
[2:08:15.000 --> 2:08:20.040]  they're going to strike back next, what he sees happening with the virus and so much
[2:08:20.040 --> 2:08:21.040]  more.
[2:08:21.040 --> 2:08:22.880]  So, Robert, great to have you back with us.
[2:08:22.880 --> 2:08:24.480]  Hey, glad to be here.
[2:08:24.480 --> 2:08:25.880]  Well, where do you want to start?
[2:08:25.880 --> 2:08:27.520]  I mean, I lay out a lot of stuff there.
[2:08:27.520 --> 2:08:30.200]  You want to just, you haven't been on a month or so, you want to go over what you saw on
[2:08:30.200 --> 2:08:33.480]  the impeachment, the trial, how you think they're going to strike back next?
[2:08:33.480 --> 2:08:38.600]  Well, I mean, I think the impeachment was sort of stage two of the constant, deep state
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:40.600]  war with Trump.
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:44.760]  I mean, it started with people who were connected to Joe Biden in that expanded National Security
[2:08:44.760 --> 2:08:45.760]  Council.
[2:08:45.760 --> 2:08:47.760]  That's what the two stories sort of interact today.
[2:08:47.760 --> 2:08:52.000]  Obama expanded the National Security Council to include a bunch of professional class hacks.
[2:08:52.000 --> 2:08:56.360]  There are really personal political emissaries with the power of the State Department and
[2:08:56.360 --> 2:09:01.000]  the CIA accessible to them as members of the National Security Council.
[2:09:01.000 --> 2:09:05.440]  It was one of those people who were purportedly advising Joe Biden, who asked, according to
[2:09:05.440 --> 2:09:11.000]  Rudy Giuliani, asked the Ukrainians to do illicit inquiries and to Trump campaign officials,
[2:09:11.000 --> 2:09:15.080]  to Trump himself, Trump's family members, and to Paul Manafort that led to probably
[2:09:15.080 --> 2:09:20.400]  the bogus black book out of Ukraine and other items that that's what Trump was trying to
[2:09:20.400 --> 2:09:22.520]  investigate and inquire into.
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:25.920]  And it was one of those connected people that he had left on his National Security
[2:09:25.920 --> 2:09:26.920]  Council.
[2:09:26.920 --> 2:09:31.640]  So he'd left all these political appointees, this dramatic expansion, a tripling of the
[2:09:31.640 --> 2:09:35.920]  size of the National Security Council, all these Obama's shadow government, deep state
[2:09:35.920 --> 2:09:42.640]  holdovers, another one of these lively, connected parties, another young kid with no real life
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:46.880]  experience, just professional class bias, to be in a position where they could be spying
[2:09:46.880 --> 2:09:51.640]  on the president when he was trying to investigate their corruption and their collusion.
[2:09:51.640 --> 2:09:55.320]  And it was frankly, it was the reason why they took out General Flynn all the way back
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:56.560]  at the beginning.
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:09:57.800]  Flynn was going to clean house.
[2:09:57.800 --> 2:10:01.120]  Flynn was going to have done this two years ago, three years ago, going to get rid of
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:06.280]  all these NSC hiries that were just political appointees of Obama, purge the State Department
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:08.120]  of its problematic people.
[2:10:08.120 --> 2:10:09.120]  He, Flynn was talking about-
[2:10:09.120 --> 2:10:12.120]  And so now, and so now Trump has learned his lesson.
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:15.560]  And this is exactly what Steve Pachennick and you and everybody have said.
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:19.880]  He was so nice or just didn't know and let it double, triple inside, left him all there.
[2:10:19.880 --> 2:10:23.080]  They took that as weakness and began beavering away.
[2:10:23.080 --> 2:10:25.480]  It shouldn't be 70, but this is a good news.
[2:10:25.480 --> 2:10:31.440]  First three, now 70, it should be logarithmic, exponential, maybe, I mean, there's thousands
[2:10:31.440 --> 2:10:32.440]  in there.
[2:10:32.440 --> 2:10:36.360]  Really, I've been told a hundred people could run the National Security Council.
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:40.440]  So they need to get rid of thousands of these people.
[2:10:40.440 --> 2:10:44.000]  They need to get rid of all of these political appointees and attaches in the State Department,
[2:10:44.000 --> 2:10:45.000]  high ranking it.
[2:10:45.000 --> 2:10:48.040]  And unfortunately, they've now infiltrated the CIA, the NSA, Brennan was putting key
[2:10:48.040 --> 2:10:50.880]  people at all kinds of places before he left.
[2:10:50.880 --> 2:10:51.880]  So they need to look-
[2:10:51.880 --> 2:10:54.480]  Did Brennan or his adjuncts appoint it as gone?
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:55.480]  Exactly.
[2:10:55.480 --> 2:10:56.480]  They need to be-
[2:10:56.480 --> 2:11:00.240]  A two-trump's credit, he's immediately taking proactive action.
[2:11:00.240 --> 2:11:03.360]  It's a, he, the impeachment woke him up.
[2:11:03.360 --> 2:11:07.240]  Similar to sort of past populist politicians, about the left and the right, Huey Long, Jim
[2:11:07.240 --> 2:11:09.920]  Folsom, you go back to other people.
[2:11:09.920 --> 2:11:12.920]  They are usually, they attempt to impeach them or indict them and that wakes them up
[2:11:12.920 --> 2:11:16.760]  to their need to be aggressive and assertive and protecting themselves.
[2:11:16.760 --> 2:11:17.760]  They cannot-
[2:11:17.760 --> 2:11:19.600]  Trump wanted to believe he could negotiate with these people.
[2:11:19.600 --> 2:11:20.600]  These people would be fair.
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:22.200]  These people would be reasonable.
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:23.200]  They're not.
[2:11:23.200 --> 2:11:26.200]  They're ruthless people who have no sense of morality, purpose or loyalty.
[2:11:26.200 --> 2:11:27.200]  That's right.
[2:11:27.200 --> 2:11:28.200]  And no sense of people fighting back.
[2:11:28.200 --> 2:11:31.600]  No, no two-way street understanding of waking and sleeping giant.
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:33.520]  You have been hammering on this show for six months.
[2:11:33.520 --> 2:11:38.680]  I've been hammering it as well, that we need a new church committee, explain the history
[2:11:38.680 --> 2:11:39.680]  of that.
[2:11:39.680 --> 2:11:41.200]  Now I see Steve Bannon out saying that everywhere.
[2:11:41.200 --> 2:11:45.240]  And look, you know, Steve, I want to be friends with Steve, but my God, two shows called
[2:11:45.240 --> 2:11:50.080]  the War Room, everything I say word for word, two days later, transcribed and copied.
[2:11:50.080 --> 2:11:53.080]  I mean, I guess it's a good thing that I'm like the mouth of Steve Bannon now.
[2:11:53.080 --> 2:11:56.760]  I mean, I load his brain with the info and you as well.
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:11:57.760]  Not against Steve.
[2:11:57.760 --> 2:11:59.080]  He was pointing out, we're original thinkers here.
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:02.280]  So anybody that hears us saying stuff, you heard Steve Bannon say, you sit in tune in
[2:12:02.280 --> 2:12:03.560]  six months ago.
[2:12:03.560 --> 2:12:09.640]  But clearly, Trump needs to champion a new church committee hearing in the Senate and
[2:12:09.640 --> 2:12:16.760]  you know, get some key people in there, get people like Josh Hawley and others in the
[2:12:16.760 --> 2:12:18.720]  position to take real action.
[2:12:18.720 --> 2:12:19.720]  Exactly.
[2:12:19.720 --> 2:12:24.080]  What they should do is they should appoint Rand Paul, the head of the new church committee
[2:12:24.080 --> 2:12:29.520]  on corruption in our NSE and our intelligence apparatus and our intelligence infrastructure
[2:12:29.520 --> 2:12:34.360]  in the national security apparatus and go at it full scale and wholesale and expose everything
[2:12:34.360 --> 2:12:35.360]  that was happening.
[2:12:35.360 --> 2:12:36.360]  That's right.
[2:12:36.360 --> 2:12:37.360]  Don't just investigate the fake charges against Trump.
[2:12:37.360 --> 2:12:38.360]  That's too small.
[2:12:38.360 --> 2:12:39.360]  Yeah.
[2:12:39.360 --> 2:12:41.800]  Go after the whole thing where they've nakedly lied defies the courts.
[2:12:41.800 --> 2:12:45.400]  They've, I mean, let's chronicle what they, but first tell folks what the church committee
[2:12:45.400 --> 2:12:47.080]  was that made on that.
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:48.080]  Exactly.
[2:12:48.080 --> 2:12:52.200]  The Frank church was the first senator ever investigated or illicitly spied on by the
[2:12:52.200 --> 2:12:53.200]  NSA.
[2:12:53.200 --> 2:12:56.480]  So as soon as he got the opportunity after Watergate, he formed a special committee,
[2:12:56.480 --> 2:13:00.600]  the committee on intelligence originated as a special select committee on intelligence,
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:04.800]  which was Frank church's committee to investigate corruption in our intelligence apparatus and
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:05.800]  law enforcement apparatus.
[2:13:05.800 --> 2:13:08.800]  And it's the church committee that exposed MK ultra.
[2:13:08.800 --> 2:13:12.400]  It's the church committee that exposed assassination attempts around the world.
[2:13:12.400 --> 2:13:16.320]  It was the church committee that exposed illicit spying, the first major illicit spying by
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:19.280]  the national security agency and by the FBI.
[2:13:19.280 --> 2:13:23.240]  It was the church committee that exposed that went into the MLK assassinations that went
[2:13:23.240 --> 2:13:26.320]  into domestic assassinations and international assassinations.
[2:13:26.320 --> 2:13:29.560]  Operation mockingbird, everything we know is from that.
[2:13:29.560 --> 2:13:30.560]  Exactly.
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:34.720]  The full confirmation corroboration of what people suspected was true, but had never been
[2:13:34.720 --> 2:13:40.840]  documented in court or Congress before was documented and demonstrated and evidentially
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:43.040]  substantiated by the church committee.
[2:13:43.040 --> 2:13:45.840]  That's why we need another church committee to clean up the corruption that corrodes.
[2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:46.840]  You're right.
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:52.000]  Ryan Paul is the perfect person that nobody doubts is nonpartisan, is a constitutionalist
[2:13:52.000 --> 2:13:56.600]  and Trump should call for him to be appointed as the head of a new committee or how would
[2:13:56.600 --> 2:13:58.600]  that work?
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:03.320]  A select committee, a committee that's whose only goal and objective is this, that he would
[2:14:03.320 --> 2:14:07.680]  be in charge of and to make it and to replicate the church committee in its entirety.
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:11.720]  And that's how we finally, instead of them launching witch hunts, we have all their naked
[2:14:11.720 --> 2:14:16.120]  admissions of illegal spying, this puts them back on their heels finally.
[2:14:16.120 --> 2:14:17.120]  This is the offensive.
[2:14:17.120 --> 2:14:21.520]  Instead of waiting for what they're going to cook up next, Trump must go on the offense,
[2:14:21.520 --> 2:14:26.560]  not with some paltry investigations about how he was targeted, no, how America was targeted
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:29.600]  by the deep state, how they tried to steal an election.
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:30.600]  Exactly.
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:34.480]  It needs to be a deep state corruption committee in the same way, in the same scale, in the
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:39.080]  same jurisdictional scope that church had that could meaningfully expose just how bad
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:43.560]  it is and bring back the people that Flynn was going to bring in.
[2:14:43.560 --> 2:14:46.640]  There's a whole bunch of people within that apparatus who want to expose corruption, collusion
[2:14:46.640 --> 2:14:47.640]  within it.
[2:14:47.640 --> 2:14:49.120]  There's still patriots at the highest ranks of government.
[2:14:49.120 --> 2:14:53.240]  Oh yeah, we're not saying all the agencies, the bad people, we need oversight and crossover
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:54.240]  and separation of powers.
[2:14:54.240 --> 2:14:55.960]  We're going to go to break, but think about this.
[2:14:55.960 --> 2:14:58.720]  Well, go ahead and just tell me now, how do you think they're going to try to come up
[2:14:58.720 --> 2:15:02.360]  with the president next if he doesn't go on the offense immediately?
[2:15:02.360 --> 2:15:03.360]  Stage three is definitely coming.
[2:15:03.360 --> 2:15:06.720]  I think they were thinking about these firings, but I think they recognize it's too close
[2:15:06.720 --> 2:15:07.720]  in time.
[2:15:07.720 --> 2:15:10.720]  So stage three is either going to be right in the middle of the election or right after
[2:15:10.720 --> 2:15:11.720]  the election.
[2:15:11.720 --> 2:15:16.320]  My guess is it's coming as an October surprise against President Trump again.
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:17.320]  But what would it be?
[2:15:17.320 --> 2:15:18.320]  I'm asking.
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:19.320]  That level.
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:24.080]  Oh, it will be of the same type, but they will try to, it will be same international
[2:15:24.080 --> 2:15:25.080]  and orientation.
[2:15:25.080 --> 2:15:28.400]  It will be some sort of Russian collusion component again.
[2:15:28.400 --> 2:15:32.560]  But they've tried the campaign aspect, they've tried the institutional aspect.
[2:15:32.560 --> 2:15:34.640]  So my guess is this one's going to be personal.
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:37.680]  We're going to try to go after him or his son and try to tie it into money in some
[2:15:37.680 --> 2:15:38.680]  way.
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:39.680]  That's right.
[2:15:39.680 --> 2:15:43.560]  They're going to try to find somebody that's done something corrupt in their giant orbit,
[2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:46.880]  threaten them with prison if they don't say Trump laundered money or something.
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:47.880]  I agree.
[2:15:47.880 --> 2:15:49.760]  They're going to go after mafia ties next.
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:51.000]  That's what my gut tells me.
[2:15:51.000 --> 2:15:52.320]  All right, we'll be back.
[2:15:52.320 --> 2:15:55.800]  Your call straight ahead.
[2:15:55.800 --> 2:16:02.200]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[2:17:13.640 --> 2:17:17.600]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is
[2:17:17.600 --> 2:17:21.680]  in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[2:17:21.680 --> 2:17:26.240]  Not a security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale

[2:17:51.240 --> 2:17:58.240]  purchasing not an offer to buy or sell the security which requires an offering document.
[2:18:51.240 --> 2:19:01.200]  This should really be easier than it is.
[2:19:01.200 --> 2:19:03.280]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:09.400]  I'm pointing out the way forward things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work
[2:19:09.400 --> 2:19:14.960]  that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:21.440]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you and will help us and
[2:19:21.440 --> 2:19:22.600]  it's symbiotic.
[2:19:22.600 --> 2:19:28.040]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[2:19:28.040 --> 2:19:29.360]  the bad halogen.
[2:19:29.360 --> 2:19:34.240]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally
[2:19:34.240 --> 2:19:41.520]  I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[2:19:41.520 --> 2:19:47.280]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:53.880]  folks get it, it's amazing, discover the benefits and it funds the InfoWare a 360 win.
[2:19:53.880 --> 2:19:59.600]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[2:19:59.600 --> 2:20:23.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:23.520 --> 2:20:52.320]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:21:00.280]  A few months ago before we went to break, the Democrats can't give up because in their
[2:21:00.280 --> 2:21:04.480]  districts it's been proven they're not being reelected, they're not popular.
[2:21:04.480 --> 2:21:09.440]  And even scientific polls show record numbers of blacks, record numbers of Hispanics and
[2:21:09.440 --> 2:21:11.760]  a lot of polls it's 30, 40, 50%.
[2:21:11.760 --> 2:21:16.520]  This is the end of the Democratic Party, just like the Labor Party's basically done in England.
[2:21:16.520 --> 2:21:20.400]  People have really broken with it and they understand that they tried to cause a race
[2:21:20.400 --> 2:21:21.400]  war.
[2:21:21.400 --> 2:21:24.680]  They're being talked down to and manipulated.
[2:21:24.680 --> 2:21:29.480]  I don't see how they bounce back from this, but they're not going to give up because they're
[2:21:29.480 --> 2:21:34.400]  financed by multinational groups that still believe they can conquer America.
[2:21:34.400 --> 2:21:39.720]  I understand that Trump has dealt with China first before he deals with everything else
[2:21:39.720 --> 2:21:44.760]  because it's communist China that the globalists set up as their main money laundering system.
[2:21:44.760 --> 2:21:50.520]  Ukraine is a secondary system, Israel is another subsystem, there's stuff in the Cayman Islands,
[2:21:50.520 --> 2:21:51.520]  it's everywhere.
[2:21:51.520 --> 2:21:56.320]  But with China now more and more being defeated, how do you tie the coronavirus in, what do
[2:21:56.320 --> 2:22:02.040]  you think is really behind it, what's the big geopolitical view, understanding who controls
[2:22:02.040 --> 2:22:05.840]  the deep state Democrats and what they're going to try next?
[2:22:05.840 --> 2:22:10.760]  I think Trump correctly saw China as a greater threat to America's future than the deep state.
[2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:15.440]  I think what he underestimated was the deep state's ability to interfere with his ability
[2:22:15.440 --> 2:22:17.160]  to get anything done vis-à-vis China.
[2:22:17.160 --> 2:22:22.080]  I mean, we've had three major stories in the last month concerning China, the Chinese corruption
[2:22:22.080 --> 2:22:26.480]  of American universities, often the number one contributor to most universities in the
[2:22:26.480 --> 2:22:28.400]  United States, particularly the elite universities.
[2:22:28.400 --> 2:22:32.320]  Buying off the governors, wasn't that a shot across the ballot Pompeo addressing governors
[2:22:32.320 --> 2:22:37.120]  saying, look, we know the Chotcoms have got your finger up your ear and you better stop
[2:22:37.120 --> 2:22:38.120]  it?
[2:22:38.120 --> 2:22:39.120]  Exactly.
[2:22:39.120 --> 2:22:40.280]  I mean, it's extraordinary.
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:46.080]  UK talking about going along with 5K and going along with a wise investment in that
[2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:50.400]  in terms of going back into bed with China, the virus, and then, of course, today the
[2:22:50.400 --> 2:22:54.200]  announcement that in fact a lot of these big hacking that's been going on, including the
[2:22:54.200 --> 2:23:00.240]  big hack of over 100 million Americans credit reports, was by Chinese military officials.
[2:23:00.240 --> 2:23:02.120]  Attorney General Barr announced that today.
[2:23:02.120 --> 2:23:06.480]  So we have this sort of public war with China over problematic behavior by China.
[2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:09.840]  You have Senator Cotton and others talking about what you've been talking about, that
[2:23:09.840 --> 2:23:15.440]  this virus appears to have been not accidental or at least not entirely accidental in its
[2:23:15.440 --> 2:23:21.240]  distribution or creation, not the organic origin that some have suggested, raising questions
[2:23:21.240 --> 2:23:22.800]  about what's really going on.
[2:23:22.800 --> 2:23:27.720]  You had China today admitting that the virus was at a much more exponential rate of exposure
[2:23:27.720 --> 2:23:31.800]  than they originally said, which some people had been forecasting the exact numbers saying,
[2:23:31.800 --> 2:23:34.520]  here's what the real numbers are and here's how they're going to hide it.
[2:23:34.520 --> 2:23:37.480]  And they forecast those numbers and that's being publicly reported today.
[2:23:37.480 --> 2:23:42.000]  So you have this extraordinary scope of China's bad actions that are now being put on trial,
[2:23:42.000 --> 2:23:45.720]  being exposed by the president, as well as undermining their trade warfare and their
[2:23:45.720 --> 2:23:48.600]  mercantilist attacks on the United States.
[2:23:48.600 --> 2:23:51.640]  But what he started to realize is right when he was achieving a lot of those successes
[2:23:51.640 --> 2:23:55.040]  in exposing China, they almost took him out with an impeachment effort.
[2:23:55.040 --> 2:23:58.320]  So the deep state is an imminent threat, an immediate threat.
[2:23:58.320 --> 2:24:01.160]  China is the long-term threat, but in order for him to deal with it.
[2:24:01.160 --> 2:24:04.000]  This purge is not a purge, it's a cleaning house.
[2:24:04.000 --> 2:24:07.880]  And Bob, I don't want to toot my horn or your horn or anybody's, but I know the White House
[2:24:07.880 --> 2:24:08.880]  listens.
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:09.880]  I know they've got a whole office does.
[2:24:09.880 --> 2:24:14.600]  That's why they want Miller out of there, but we come on Friday with the head of the
[2:24:14.600 --> 2:24:19.400]  former bio weapons, you know, treaty developer for the U.S., the head guy.
[2:24:19.400 --> 2:24:20.520]  He says they've got to come out.
[2:24:20.520 --> 2:24:23.680]  The White House must say it looks like it's man-made, call for investigation.
[2:24:23.680 --> 2:24:25.520]  Five hours later, they do it.
[2:24:25.520 --> 2:24:29.520]  I come on here like a month ago and I said, Barr needs to come out and talk about how
[2:24:29.520 --> 2:24:33.680]  Child Protective Services in the U.S. is connected to multinational groups, they're
[2:24:33.680 --> 2:24:34.720]  trafficking children.
[2:24:34.720 --> 2:24:36.440]  He does it this weekend.
[2:24:36.440 --> 2:24:41.520]  We come out and say, look Pompeo, you're not getting rid of the deep state that's targeting
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:43.000]  myself particularly.
[2:24:43.000 --> 2:24:45.480]  I want all the Obama holdovers removed.
[2:24:45.480 --> 2:24:49.760]  Now, obviously that's the right thing to do anyways, but it's crazy.
[2:24:49.760 --> 2:24:54.440]  Are we simpotico with the White House now or are they using Info Wars as the popular
[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:58.560]  sounding board because they know we're not controlled to try to get the pulse of the
[2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:00.160]  people and doing what we want?
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:03.240]  It's not like we're threatening the White House, but it just seems like suddenly everything
[2:25:03.240 --> 2:25:04.520]  we want starting to happen.
[2:25:04.520 --> 2:25:09.560]  Well, I think it was always been the tip of the spear for the populist base of the Trump
[2:25:09.560 --> 2:25:12.640]  support base and he's always paid attention to that.
[2:25:12.640 --> 2:25:16.600]  And I think that the problem has been his willingness and his readiness to take action
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:20.760]  on it because he thought he could work with deep state actors to achieve this broader
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:26.400]  objective of containing China, not recognizing that China has infiltrated large aspects of
[2:25:26.400 --> 2:25:30.280]  the deep state apparatus, particularly the think tanks and private universities and other
[2:25:30.280 --> 2:25:31.560]  institutions.
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:35.280]  People know they can leave U.S. government service and get their most profitable gig
[2:25:35.280 --> 2:25:36.440]  is with China.
[2:25:36.440 --> 2:25:37.440]  That's why Trump was right to talk about it.
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:40.440]  We just saw the top Harvard professor indicted, exactly.
[2:25:40.440 --> 2:25:41.680]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:25:41.680 --> 2:25:44.920]  And it's not a coincidence that Harvard's one of the biggest recipients of Chinese government
[2:25:44.920 --> 2:25:47.480]  funds of anybody in the entire country.
[2:25:47.480 --> 2:25:49.640]  So the, but this has been mostly suppressed.
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:53.600]  The ordinary person has no clue of the scope and scale to which this is occurring.
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:56.440]  And let's be clear, it's not like China just did this on their own.
[2:25:56.440 --> 2:26:00.120]  People controlling our government for 50 years make one side of deals to make jobs go to
[2:26:00.120 --> 2:26:02.720]  China, they then get a big fat piece of it.
[2:26:02.720 --> 2:26:03.720]  Exactly.
[2:26:03.720 --> 2:26:05.560]  In fact, I mean, this is, this is a replication.
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:08.920]  Kevin Phillips was talking about this in the 80s and he was saying what's going to happen
[2:26:08.920 --> 2:26:13.120]  is China is going to replicate what the U.S. did to UK, both in terms of manufacturing and
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:14.120]  political influence.
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:16.240]  And that's precisely what's happened since the mid 1990s.
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:21.080]  It's a reason why the first real for the actual real foreign interference in the U.S. election
[2:26:21.080 --> 2:26:26.160]  was Chinese donors to the Clinton campaign in 1996 that Janet Reno then hushed up a
[2:26:26.160 --> 2:26:27.160]  year later.
[2:26:27.160 --> 2:26:28.160]  Exactly.
[2:26:28.160 --> 2:26:31.760]  And I guess what's going to happen as it becomes clear that everybody that's been against
[2:26:31.760 --> 2:26:36.280]  Trump and us as a CHICOM trader, this looks like a recipe for victory if Trump just does
[2:26:36.280 --> 2:26:40.680]  a national address and points it out with pie charts and the head of the CIA with him
[2:26:40.680 --> 2:26:41.680]  and Pompeo.
[2:26:41.680 --> 2:26:42.680]  I mean, it's game over.
[2:26:42.680 --> 2:26:46.720]  You tell Americans you're in league with foreign enemies and we show the Washington post saying
[2:26:46.720 --> 2:26:48.640]  hopefully G crushes Trump.
[2:26:48.640 --> 2:26:52.400]  I mean, it's, it's so obvious how they threw their lot in with these guys.
[2:26:52.400 --> 2:26:53.400]  Exactly.
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:57.840]  And what Trump should do is he's doing part of it now, go after and purge the deep state
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:02.680]  apparatus that was a hindrance to making meaningful reform with China, continue to march on China
[2:27:02.680 --> 2:27:07.320]  in terms of federal prosecutions, in terms of trade sanctions and the rest.
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:12.240]  But in addition, he really should take a third aspect to that too, which is he, he doesn't
[2:27:12.240 --> 2:27:15.920]  have the support, the outside support, the parallel support he did have when he came
[2:27:15.920 --> 2:27:16.920]  in.
[2:27:16.920 --> 2:27:23.520]  Julian Assange is now sitting in a prison cell, he has allowed his, his grassroots infrastructure
[2:27:23.520 --> 2:27:24.760]  to be annihilated.
[2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:29.320]  Exactly, he needs to start to restore that grassroots and what he can do and the way
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:34.640]  he can start, he can start by pardon Roger Stone now, pardon General Flynn now, pardon
[2:27:34.640 --> 2:27:35.640]  Julian Assange.
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:39.240]  I was about to say if he just signals he cares, it'll triple his support.
[2:27:39.240 --> 2:27:40.240]  Absolutely.
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:43.880]  And it will start to restore that grassroots third party support because they were going
[2:27:43.880 --> 2:27:50.760]  after Flynn and Stone and Assange, not just him out because they were uniquely influential
[2:27:50.760 --> 2:27:55.100]  individuals on behalf of the president, but to terrify anybody else from stepping up for
[2:27:55.100 --> 2:27:57.600]  Trump in this next election and within the administration.
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:27:58.600]  And by the way.
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:27:59.600]  If he wants people to.
[2:27:59.600 --> 2:28:02.840]  By the, I don't want to enter myself into this thing, but obviously they try to take
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:06.560]  us out too, but only the listeners kept us in play.
[2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:07.560]  Exactly.
[2:28:07.560 --> 2:28:09.840]  And what he needs to do is he needs to restore confidence and faith in that.
[2:28:09.840 --> 2:28:14.040]  So he needs to make public efforts towards all the third party outsider participants
[2:28:14.040 --> 2:28:18.240]  that keep him afloat and alive and show his support of them, show his sympathy towards
[2:28:18.240 --> 2:28:22.840]  them and take executive action where he can, because that will signal to that whole crowd.
[2:28:22.840 --> 2:28:27.240]  Okay, we can now stand up for the president, start to fight for the president, interact
[2:28:27.240 --> 2:28:29.040]  for the president and purge the deep state.
[2:28:29.040 --> 2:28:31.320]  And it's not like we even want the protection.
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:34.120]  We want the general saying, I'm with you attack.
[2:28:34.120 --> 2:28:36.360]  It's him silent is what people don't like.
[2:28:36.360 --> 2:28:37.360]  Exactly.
[2:28:37.360 --> 2:28:38.360]  Correct.
[2:28:38.360 --> 2:28:41.840]  The, I mean, the protection can be as simple as a pardon in the case of those three individuals,
[2:28:41.840 --> 2:28:45.480]  but for everyone else, it can simply be rhetorical and by association.
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:47.480]  He started to do it.
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:48.480]  Hold on.
[2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:49.480]  Stay right there.
[2:28:49.480 --> 2:28:50.480]  We'll come back and we'll take calls.
[2:28:50.480 --> 2:28:51.480]  Robert Barnes, our guest.
[2:28:51.480 --> 2:28:52.480]  Stay with us.
[2:28:52.480 --> 2:28:59.920]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.

[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:03.520]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:03.520 --> 2:29:09.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined
[2:29:09.000 --> 2:29:10.120]  my life.
[2:29:10.120 --> 2:29:15.360]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:15.360 --> 2:29:19.960]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it
[2:29:19.960 --> 2:29:23.720]  alone, you need to call the national treatment advisors.

[2:30:54.760 --> 2:31:04.960]  Cobra commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not
[2:31:04.960 --> 2:31:11.880]  get sunshine, and to not love cheeses, and of course, to not get storable foods or any
[2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:17.320]  other types of colloidal nano silver at InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:31:17.320 --> 2:31:19.240]  Do not do it.
[2:31:19.240 --> 2:31:28.320]  Trust CNN, trust MSNBC, drink fluoridated water just like the loving kiss of a king cobra
[2:31:28.320 --> 2:31:37.600]  pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients in their body, hug the cobra, love the cobra,
[2:31:37.600 --> 2:31:46.720]  kiss the cobra, but never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[2:31:46.720 --> 2:31:56.520]  Do not order those products, silence, don't, no.
[2:31:56.520 --> 2:32:01.000]  Most all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food, but I know for a fact
[2:32:01.000 --> 2:32:05.760]  from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it, get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[2:32:05.760 --> 2:32:07.440]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[2:32:07.440 --> 2:32:11.880]  I've been on radio for 25 years, I've had storable food for a long time, and I learned
[2:32:11.880 --> 2:32:16.160]  very quickly a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis
[2:32:16.160 --> 2:32:20.160]  they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[2:32:20.160 --> 2:32:24.840]  That's why about 11 years ago I found my Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company
[2:32:24.840 --> 2:32:28.600]  out there and I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand,
[2:32:28.600 --> 2:32:31.440]  they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say they're
[2:32:31.440 --> 2:32:35.120]  going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people.
[2:32:35.120 --> 2:32:38.280]  Now they were saying seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food but they
[2:32:38.280 --> 2:32:40.320]  got a package at record level orders.
[2:32:40.320 --> 2:32:45.080]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[2:32:45.080 --> 2:32:49.200]  So get your orders at InfoWarsStore.com, get the best deals, get it delivered first, they're
[2:32:49.200 --> 2:32:53.080]  in our system, it goes right to them, then it funds the InfoWars as well, so get prepared
[2:32:53.080 --> 2:33:00.080]  at InfoWarsStore.com with SwarbleFoods.
[2:33:23.080 --> 2:33:52.080]  You know, there's not just evil in this universe, there's good as well.
[2:33:52.080 --> 2:33:57.520]  And America and much of the world has been asleep, but now we're in the time of awakening
[2:33:57.520 --> 2:34:03.080]  and all those that thought they had it all sewed up are in for a very, very rude awakening.
[2:34:03.080 --> 2:34:09.800]  Now talking to Barnes here, there are thousands of channels of cable and hundreds of new Netflix
[2:34:09.800 --> 2:34:14.320]  shows a week and it seems like everybody wants to be an actor in the movies and there's
[2:34:14.320 --> 2:34:19.760]  all this fantasy land, but I know listeners understand this.
[2:34:19.760 --> 2:34:22.440]  This is real.
[2:34:22.440 --> 2:34:27.200]  And I don't sit back and go, man, we're one of the only big, well-produced, powerful shows.
[2:34:27.200 --> 2:34:31.640]  There's a lot of smart people out there doing little shows, which I wish were huge, but
[2:34:31.640 --> 2:34:37.160]  we're one of the only, if not the only organization that's actually given the globalists a run
[2:34:37.160 --> 2:34:38.640]  for their money.
[2:34:38.640 --> 2:34:39.640]  And guess what?
[2:34:39.640 --> 2:34:42.000]  People wanted prosperity and freedom and justice.
[2:34:42.000 --> 2:34:48.040]  They didn't want globalism because if I'm anything, I'm a salesman.
[2:34:48.040 --> 2:34:50.600]  All that means is you promote ideas you believe in.
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:56.560]  I'm a father, I'm a fighter, I'm a lot of things, but I mean, I sell things I believe
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:34:59.560]  in like freedom.
[2:34:59.560 --> 2:35:00.880]  Don't have to give me any money for it.
[2:35:00.880 --> 2:35:04.080]  You just got to believe in it and believe what I'm saying and believe it for yourself
[2:35:04.080 --> 2:35:06.840]  and promote it.
[2:35:06.840 --> 2:35:09.720]  And I need to sell you on how valuable you are.
[2:35:09.720 --> 2:35:12.400]  I need to sell you on the strength you've got.
[2:35:12.400 --> 2:35:17.600]  So you don't sit there and say it's all over, America's done, there's nothing we can do.
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:24.680]  Not at the time that we're starting to turn the time.
[2:35:24.680 --> 2:35:29.080]  When you wake up and you realize how bad things are, a lot of times people give up, but you
[2:35:29.080 --> 2:35:35.400]  just woke up, if you were already, it'd be like driving down the road and your buddy
[2:35:35.400 --> 2:35:38.720]  falls asleep in the middle of the night driving back from El Cunning.
[2:35:38.720 --> 2:35:43.720]  This happened to me once and you drive off a big embankment down a cliff by the grace
[2:35:43.720 --> 2:35:44.720]  of God.
[2:35:44.720 --> 2:35:45.720]  We didn't die.
[2:35:45.720 --> 2:35:49.200]  We just went to one spot and shot back up and then flip three times and I didn't wake
[2:35:49.200 --> 2:35:50.560]  up till we were flipping.
[2:35:50.560 --> 2:35:54.240]  Now, about a state of sleep and we hit a tree and died.
[2:35:54.240 --> 2:35:55.240]  Would I have been any safer?
[2:35:55.240 --> 2:35:56.240]  No.
[2:35:56.240 --> 2:35:57.720]  By the time I woke up, we were starting to flip.
[2:35:57.720 --> 2:36:01.240]  I was like, man, I was asleep and he ran off the road.
[2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:03.720]  Once the police got there like an hour, they're like, you're lucky you're alive.
[2:36:03.720 --> 2:36:08.200]  We ran way down this multi-hundred foot deal and up and it hit and jumped and then the
[2:36:08.200 --> 2:36:11.440]  thing flipped like some out of a movie.
[2:36:11.440 --> 2:36:16.560]  And I was on like sixteen years old and that happened.
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:20.120]  But if I'd have been killed in that and never woke up, I still would have been in the wreck,
[2:36:20.120 --> 2:36:22.840]  but I was awake during it and I lived.
[2:36:22.840 --> 2:36:27.320]  And so just because we've woken up now, we're in the middle of a wreck, we're going to make
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:29.160]  it through this wreck.
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:31.120]  And what we do after it is what matters.
[2:36:31.120 --> 2:36:32.560]  So that's my weird allegory.
[2:36:32.560 --> 2:36:34.520]  I didn't think that up on the fly.
[2:36:34.520 --> 2:36:37.400]  It's something that happened to me and I was just comparing it to what's happening today.
[2:36:37.400 --> 2:36:41.200]  Robert Barnes, smart constitutional lawyer.
[2:36:41.200 --> 2:36:42.960]  It's Trump's to lose now.
[2:36:42.960 --> 2:36:44.320]  They are demoralized.
[2:36:44.320 --> 2:36:48.960]  I don't go out in public down and get spit at for every five hundred hands I shake or
[2:36:48.960 --> 2:36:50.680]  whatever I get spit at.
[2:36:50.680 --> 2:36:55.200]  Now they just look demoralized and scared, but a lot of leftists now kind of smile at
[2:36:55.200 --> 2:36:58.640]  me and come over and say, maybe we were wrong.
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:37:04.280]  So I'm seeing grassroots in Austin that's basically San Francisco's rear end.
[2:37:04.280 --> 2:37:06.680]  I'm even seeing them not just give up on hating me.
[2:37:06.680 --> 2:37:12.800]  I'm seeing them actually shake it off and realize they were under a cult like programming.
[2:37:12.800 --> 2:37:13.800]  What are you saying?
[2:37:13.800 --> 2:37:18.360]  Well, I think there's no question that the Democratic Party is sort of out of sorts because
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:21.840]  essentially they sort of made a deep state alliance both when the Mueller inquiry and
[2:37:21.840 --> 2:37:25.400]  with impeachment, I think they in part thought that's why it would work.
[2:37:25.400 --> 2:37:30.480]  They would replicate Watergate's deep state apparatus that was behind the going after
[2:37:30.480 --> 2:37:31.480]  Nixon.
[2:37:31.480 --> 2:37:33.880]  And then if they did it, if they duplicated it, they would have success instead.
[2:37:33.880 --> 2:37:35.200]  They had total failure.
[2:37:35.200 --> 2:37:37.160]  People like Professor Dershowitz made the same argument.
[2:37:37.160 --> 2:37:40.880]  I and other people were arguing the entire impeachment effort was unconstitutional, was
[2:37:40.880 --> 2:37:45.000]  a violation of the high crimes and misdemeanors clause because they didn't charge a high crime
[2:37:45.000 --> 2:37:46.000]  or misdemeanor.
[2:37:46.000 --> 2:37:49.080]  Ultimately, the acquittal vindicates that position.
[2:37:49.080 --> 2:37:52.840]  And so I think to that sense, they feel dismayed.
[2:37:52.840 --> 2:37:56.000]  They also clearly lack institutional integrity.
[2:37:56.000 --> 2:37:59.680]  They lack the sort of people beyond Bernie and other, you know, Tulsi Gabbard, one or
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:00.680]  two others.
[2:38:00.680 --> 2:38:03.640]  They have nobody who people even think of as honest.
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:07.920]  And they think of Bernie is honest, but not necessarily the ideas they want to embrace.
[2:38:07.920 --> 2:38:12.320]  And so the, I mean, clearly the deep state has a planet candidate in my view in the democratic
[2:38:12.320 --> 2:38:13.640]  crime rate process.
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:19.200]  If people research Pete Buttigieg's background, he has a very unusual Obama like background,
[2:38:19.200 --> 2:38:20.840]  but it's even weirder than Obama's.
[2:38:20.840 --> 2:38:22.040]  I mean, he comes out of nowhere.
[2:38:22.040 --> 2:38:24.160]  Yeah, he's completely synthetic.
[2:38:24.160 --> 2:38:25.160]  Absolutely.
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:30.480]  I mean, his father was the translator for Antonio Gramsci's writings, the sort of very good
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:33.480]  analytical writing, but communist influenced writing.
[2:38:33.480 --> 2:38:36.520]  So that gives you an idea for his background.
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:40.360]  And yet he is being, I mean, here's a guy who's just a mayor of a tiny town who suddenly
[2:38:40.360 --> 2:38:43.000]  a leading candidate for the presidency of the United States.
[2:38:43.000 --> 2:38:44.000]  How does that happen?
[2:38:44.000 --> 2:38:46.680]  He also is one of those guys that somehow ended up in the military, but never went through
[2:38:46.680 --> 2:38:47.680]  basic training.
[2:38:47.680 --> 2:38:50.120]  He got some special direct commission.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:54.000]  It's like who gave this kid a sudden direct commission that was purely a show gig that
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:56.520]  appeared to be CIA ties to where he was working.
[2:38:56.520 --> 2:39:01.200]  He appears to have been simply a CIA front guy in Afghanistan, not an actual real vet.
[2:39:01.200 --> 2:39:04.960]  And yet the media is pretending he's a veteran and removing the only actual veteran from
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:07.680]  the debate stage in the last debate in New Hampshire.
[2:39:07.680 --> 2:39:12.400]  So these are clearly a coordinated effort to elevate him because the deep state doesn't
[2:39:12.400 --> 2:39:14.520]  trust Bernie.
[2:39:14.520 --> 2:39:17.560]  They despise Trump, but they distrust Bernie.
[2:39:17.560 --> 2:39:18.560]  So they want some other.
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:19.560]  Got level.
[2:39:19.560 --> 2:39:20.560]  What is he happening at the convention?
[2:39:20.560 --> 2:39:21.560]  I mean, Hillary always wanted to run again.
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:24.960]  I don't think it'll happen now, but she wants to keep saying she is behind the scenes to
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:28.040]  maintain control of the apparatus.
[2:39:28.040 --> 2:39:32.120]  Well, she's creating a it's a hybrid Humphrey 1968 and the whole election feels a lot like
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:35.520]  1968 or 1972, depending on which one you pick.
[2:39:35.520 --> 2:39:39.480]  And the right now the even the sort of liberal data nerds.
[2:39:39.480 --> 2:39:43.560]  Now you said it three months ago, she wants to broker the broker convention and be the
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:44.560]  kingmaker.
[2:39:44.560 --> 2:39:45.560]  Exactly.
[2:39:45.560 --> 2:39:48.200]  Her goal is to recreate 1968.
[2:39:48.200 --> 2:39:53.480]  The best way to recreate 1968 is to have Bernie with the most delegates, but nowhere
[2:39:53.480 --> 2:39:57.160]  near a majority and to make sure there's no one who could replace her.
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:39:59.080]  Because Kamala Harris is out.
[2:39:59.080 --> 2:40:02.480]  The Elizabeth Warren is struggling.
[2:40:02.480 --> 2:40:07.800]  So the degree to which it's booted judge and Biden and Bernie and that crew, Hillary is
[2:40:07.800 --> 2:40:11.680]  in the best position to come in and steal it because she can steal from each part of
[2:40:11.680 --> 2:40:14.360]  the group since she can promise different things to different people.
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:16.520]  So they're also not making her the VP.
[2:40:16.520 --> 2:40:21.680]  Yeah, I mean, I think there's talk about I would if I was that I would never make Hillary
[2:40:21.680 --> 2:40:22.680]  Clinton.
[2:40:22.680 --> 2:40:23.680]  I've got VP.
[2:40:23.680 --> 2:40:29.200]  Yes, you need a big, big, big, big life insurance policy for that.
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:32.360]  You're like Malcolm X at the end of his life where nobody would even give him a life insurance
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:36.880]  policy, no matter how much he would pay if Hillary is your VP, you have no life insurance
[2:40:36.880 --> 2:40:37.880]  policy.
[2:40:37.880 --> 2:40:41.640]  The so I mean, I think I think there's different aspects of that, but I think the deep state
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:44.120]  apparatus doesn't trust any of these people.
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:47.480]  The but they would be okay with Bloomberg, who's sort of been a corrupt billionaire for
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:49.000]  a long time.
[2:40:49.000 --> 2:40:52.240]  But Bloomberg, there's no way the Democratic Democratic Party and the Bernie folks are
[2:40:52.240 --> 2:40:53.240]  going to go nuts.
[2:40:53.240 --> 2:40:58.400]  Now, why is Bloomberg just, he's just a cover for spending hundreds of millions of not
[2:40:58.400 --> 2:41:00.440]  billions, he says, against Trump.
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:04.600]  He's just there as a cover to get around campaign finance.
[2:41:04.600 --> 2:41:05.600]  That's half of it.
[2:41:05.600 --> 2:41:08.120]  The other half of it is to prevent Bernie from getting a majority.
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:12.840]  Bloomberg wants delegates and as long as he hits 15% in some of these big, heavy, vote-rich
[2:41:12.840 --> 2:41:17.400]  states on Super Tuesday, where he is spending close to half a billion dollars already, then
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.720]  he can prevent anybody from getting a majority and he can become a kingmaker at the Democratic
[2:41:21.720 --> 2:41:22.720]  Party Convention.
[2:41:22.720 --> 2:41:26.360]  I'm definitely going to be there in Milwaukee, got a lot of old friends in Milwaukee.
[2:41:26.360 --> 2:41:28.360]  Milwaukee's going to look like Chicago 1968.
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:30.760]  We're going to be there covering it.
[2:41:30.760 --> 2:41:31.760]  Stay there.
[2:41:31.760 --> 2:41:34.440]  I promise callers when we come out of break, we're going to give each caller about a minute
[2:41:34.440 --> 2:41:35.440]  or so.
[2:41:35.440 --> 2:41:39.440]  Patty and Greg and Hayden and Steve and Schmig first and Levi and everybody will get to you
[2:41:39.440 --> 2:41:41.200]  and then Barnes to take over a few segments.
[2:41:41.200 --> 2:41:48.040]  And then we're going to have the great analysis of Terrell Salente coming up just briefly because
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:59.040]  I didn't even really plug this hour, who's got Homeland Security certified nano silver
[2:41:59.040 --> 2:42:02.440]  that they said till SARS, which is the same family as Corona.
[2:42:02.440 --> 2:42:04.480]  All I know is this is immune gargle.
[2:42:04.480 --> 2:42:05.480]  You can swish it out.
[2:42:05.480 --> 2:42:06.800]  You can drink it.
[2:42:06.800 --> 2:42:10.560]  It's super high quality from the top nano tech company here in the U.S. where the only
[2:42:10.560 --> 2:42:14.760]  folks that are allowed to private label this, it's sold out.
[2:42:14.760 --> 2:42:18.360]  Every ounce is still available at current sales rates will be gone in a week.
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:23.800]  The current sales rates, the one ounce spray bottle will be gone in three or four days.
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:29.240]  And I'm still leaving it at 40% off, except our sales manager came to us, the general
[2:42:29.240 --> 2:42:34.320]  manager came to us this morning and he said, you realize that, okay, you're looking at
[2:42:34.320 --> 2:42:38.800]  the fact you're selling out of this 40% off, but we only make like 25, 30% off on that.
[2:42:38.800 --> 2:42:41.960]  I mean, could you only market up 100% Alex?
[2:42:41.960 --> 2:42:44.840]  We have to reorder it.
[2:42:44.840 --> 2:42:46.080]  And I went, Oh, how much is that?
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:47.400]  He says, this is how much it is.
[2:42:47.400 --> 2:42:53.840]  If you want to reorder it again, I went, Oh, so these are both at 40% off for two more
[2:42:53.840 --> 2:42:54.840]  days.
[2:42:54.840 --> 2:43:00.520]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world, a lot of people that never deliver.
[2:43:00.520 --> 2:43:08.840]  Well, I'm here to tell you info wars has delivered in royal flush in a handful of aces page because

[2:43:46.960 --> 2:43:51.120]  during this election year that's so critical, but they need the financing to put them in

[2:45:39.040 --> 2:45:44.080]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the
[2:45:44.080 --> 2:45:50.120]  viruses and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.

[2:47:32.160 --> 2:47:40.760]  Owen shroyer takes over and Barnes is going to be handicapping the opening of democratic
[2:47:40.760 --> 2:47:42.640]  primary tomorrow and how huge that'll be.
[2:47:42.640 --> 2:47:46.760]  We'll be here late tomorrow night covering it all extended coverage after 6pm.
[2:47:46.760 --> 2:47:47.760]  Look for that.
[2:47:47.760 --> 2:47:50.960]  But I promise I get to these calls and I appreciate you holding so long.
[2:47:50.960 --> 2:47:56.680]  Smig in Texas, moving to small towns topic, bugging out, thanks for holding.
[2:47:56.680 --> 2:47:58.240]  What is your view on that?
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:01.840]  What is your view on what you think people should do?
[2:48:01.840 --> 2:48:09.200]  I agree with partially with Charles Murray, but I agree with you totally.
[2:48:09.200 --> 2:48:12.480]  You need to keep standing throughout it.
[2:48:12.480 --> 2:48:20.360]  Mr. Murray's answer was not quite right, because if you're tough, you're going to hang
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:21.680]  in for the long run.
[2:48:21.680 --> 2:48:27.880]  If you have young children, you would move out if you could afford to and that you don't
[2:48:27.880 --> 2:48:29.560]  run out of time.
[2:48:29.560 --> 2:48:35.240]  The problem is, what we have is a situation like the Titanic.
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:39.280]  We can't, there's a point where we can't save the ship anymore.
[2:48:39.280 --> 2:48:41.760]  Do we stay with the ship and drown?
[2:48:41.760 --> 2:48:42.760]  No.
[2:48:42.760 --> 2:48:46.080]  We jump out and we try and save ourselves.
[2:48:46.080 --> 2:48:48.280]  And that's at the point that we're at right now.
[2:48:48.280 --> 2:48:51.720]  And so we've got to start building lifeboats because we're not sure.
[2:48:51.720 --> 2:48:52.720]  Exactly.
[2:48:52.720 --> 2:48:59.000]  Right now, President Trump is doing everything that he can, but remember, he's not the fixture.
[2:48:59.000 --> 2:49:00.800]  He's the revealer.
[2:49:00.800 --> 2:49:07.840]  You see, because this brings me to my second point, will the GOP or the MAGA save you eternally?
[2:49:07.840 --> 2:49:08.840]  The answer is no.
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:09.840]  No, only Christ.
[2:49:09.840 --> 2:49:10.840]  Jesus Christ.
[2:49:10.840 --> 2:49:12.640]  Jesus Christ is your only way.
[2:49:12.640 --> 2:49:17.920]  Now, remember, this is for you, to who much is given, much is expected.
[2:49:17.920 --> 2:49:23.640]  And I'm very pleased with the way that you've been blossoming in your faith with Jesus Christ.
[2:49:23.640 --> 2:49:28.920]  Now, the third point that I was going to say is that the refugees spreading throughout
[2:49:28.920 --> 2:49:36.800]  the United States and bases, Miramar, I.E., this is a good example of why you should not
[2:49:36.800 --> 2:49:37.800]  do that.
[2:49:37.800 --> 2:49:41.680]  They should have kept them at Nichols Naval Base there in Hawaii.
[2:49:41.680 --> 2:49:44.680]  Why bring them into the cone?
[2:49:44.680 --> 2:49:51.840]  And another point that I have is Executive Order 13295, Obama Residue.
[2:49:51.840 --> 2:49:58.840]  Petros tweeted yesterday, or I mean Friday, a shepherd ambulance put down there that their
[2:49:58.840 --> 2:50:01.960]  mobilization is active.
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:04.720]  So this was the incubation period.
[2:50:04.720 --> 2:50:10.440]  So now, you know, Obama is trying to mobilize the claws of the beast are on us.
[2:50:10.440 --> 2:50:13.840]  They're about to start penetrating.
[2:50:13.840 --> 2:50:20.000]  And we have to be very careful because whether the end cop comes here, it doesn't matter.
[2:50:20.000 --> 2:50:24.320]  Now they're mobilizing, they're ready for the martial, the medical martial law.
[2:50:24.320 --> 2:50:25.320]  This is a problem.
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:32.360]  Now, the funny point that I'll leave you with is that I knew that Obama was a slimy guy.
[2:50:32.360 --> 2:50:41.520]  And I saw in the daily news that the worm, it's a Nungara worm, it's a flat worm.
[2:50:41.520 --> 2:50:47.280]  It's Obama Nungara, N-U-N-G-A-R-A worm.
[2:50:47.280 --> 2:50:51.200]  That one is a worm that's invading France right now.
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:50:55.640]  So now we know why President Obama was a slimy creature.
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:50:56.640]  Wow.
[2:50:56.640 --> 2:50:58.160]  Powerful call, Smig.
[2:50:58.160 --> 2:51:00.680]  Call back again.
[2:51:00.680 --> 2:51:04.720]  It really does come down to the fact that Trump can only reveal stuff.
[2:51:04.720 --> 2:51:07.320]  We have to fix it and God has to begin us to do it.
[2:51:07.320 --> 2:51:09.400]  Can you comment on that, Robert Barnes?
[2:51:09.400 --> 2:51:14.240]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt that public participation is critical and essential and
[2:51:14.240 --> 2:51:19.160]  that a sort of shared spiritual approach is necessary for any meaningful societal reform
[2:51:19.160 --> 2:51:20.840]  of any kind.
[2:51:20.840 --> 2:51:25.280]  What Trump has clearly revealed is not only the media's corruption and collusion of the
[2:51:25.280 --> 2:51:29.480]  Democratic Party's problems, that's just Tammany Hall on a global scale, but it's in
[2:51:29.480 --> 2:51:33.760]  addition to all of that, it's the deep state collude corruption and how much it has corroded
[2:51:33.760 --> 2:51:39.200]  the highest ranking apparatus, law enforcement, national security, military, all of these
[2:51:39.200 --> 2:51:43.560]  high-ranking officials in these part of the government disproportionately influenced by
[2:51:43.560 --> 2:51:48.320]  deep state policies and idolatry that is our greatest threat to any kind of freedom or
[2:51:48.320 --> 2:51:52.320]  liberty moving forward, even more so than China, because we can't go at China until
[2:51:52.320 --> 2:51:54.600]  the deep state problem is solved.
[2:51:54.600 --> 2:52:01.160]  And how narcissistic and in love, people like Vidman are of themselves, it's just bizarre.
[2:52:01.160 --> 2:52:02.800]  Hayden in Missouri, you're on the air.
[2:52:02.800 --> 2:52:03.800]  Thanks for holding.
[2:52:03.800 --> 2:52:04.800]  Go ahead.
[2:52:04.800 --> 2:52:05.800]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:52:05.800 --> 2:52:06.800]  Long time listener.
[2:52:06.800 --> 2:52:12.080]  I'm taller, just want to first say, my Patriot supplies food is awesome, ordered from you
[2:52:12.080 --> 2:52:17.120]  a couple of years ago, have two other brands of storeable food and that stuff doesn't last
[2:52:17.120 --> 2:52:20.360]  as long, then taste is good.
[2:52:20.360 --> 2:52:26.680]  But first thing I wanted to say just is the numbers of the coronavirus, they started reporting
[2:52:26.680 --> 2:52:34.560]  the cases that people have recovered, and so 3,669 people have been reported to recover
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:42.200]  from it, 910 people have died, that comes out to be a 20% mortality rate, so even the
[2:52:42.200 --> 2:52:46.200]  official numbers now show it has a much higher death rate than they were saying.
[2:52:46.200 --> 2:52:50.840]  Yeah, the Chinese government says 15%, Barnes, you look at a lot of numbers, you're a big
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:54.800]  numbers country, you're a famous gambler, very successful, what do you think about
[2:52:54.800 --> 2:52:55.800]  the numbers?
[2:52:55.800 --> 2:53:01.800]  I think the numbers are going to continue to rise, whatever the source, whatever the
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:07.800]  origin was, whatever the purpose was, the mortality rate, first it was 5%, 10%, now
[2:53:07.800 --> 2:53:11.800]  it's between 15% and 20%, depending on which numbers you believe, the numbers may be even
[2:53:11.800 --> 2:53:15.600]  higher because there's so little adequate information coming out.
[2:53:15.600 --> 2:53:19.640]  What you see is we're seeing little micro examples now, they're like the Japanese cruise
[2:53:19.640 --> 2:53:24.800]  ship, which a huge number end up contaminated, that's a rapid spread of contamination, and
[2:53:24.800 --> 2:53:25.800]  that's just rapid.
[2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:28.360]  So that's telling you this is pretty nasty.
[2:53:28.360 --> 2:53:29.360]  Exactly, exactly.
[2:53:29.360 --> 2:53:32.840]  And it shows the power of government, for those people who wonder like why would any
[2:53:32.840 --> 2:53:36.800]  state be involved in this, why would the Chinese government potentially be involved in this?
[2:53:36.800 --> 2:53:40.280]  Well, one, they're showing the power they can unleash on the world.
[2:53:40.280 --> 2:53:45.000]  But putting that aside, I mean, look at how quickly this disease spread, that to some
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:49.880]  degree is the power of the state to determine just that aspect by its reporting components
[2:53:49.880 --> 2:53:54.560]  and by its reaction, but on top of that, you look at the behavior, they have people under
[2:53:54.560 --> 2:54:01.280]  complete control, like in China, people who are willing to completely abiding, basically
[2:54:01.280 --> 2:54:06.040]  live with home detention, just because of fear of this disease.
[2:54:06.040 --> 2:54:08.280]  That's the power that biological warfare can have.
[2:54:08.280 --> 2:54:11.440]  And that shuts down the fact that she lost his trade war.
[2:54:11.440 --> 2:54:14.960]  Levi in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead, Levi.
[2:54:14.960 --> 2:54:17.040]  Good morning, Alex.
[2:54:17.040 --> 2:54:18.040]  Hi.
[2:54:18.040 --> 2:54:20.840]  I'll be really fast because there's a couple of things I want to go through with you.
[2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:22.600]  Number one.
[2:54:22.600 --> 2:54:26.880]  Back when Hurricane Harvey came out, you'll remember that there was a gentleman or someone
[2:54:26.880 --> 2:54:31.880]  put a fake, a fake Facebook page, a post about gasoline running out and it was a panic for
[2:54:31.880 --> 2:54:32.880]  gasoline.
[2:54:32.880 --> 2:54:33.880]  Yes.
[2:54:33.880 --> 2:54:34.880]  I know that.
[2:54:34.880 --> 2:54:35.880]  Okay.
[2:54:35.880 --> 2:54:36.880]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:41.200]  I've been going out and I've been buying water and supplies and I have purchased a ton
[2:54:41.200 --> 2:54:44.600]  of stuff through you to help everything.
[2:54:44.600 --> 2:54:49.200]  And I am just totally dismayed at the total number of people who are got their head in
[2:54:49.200 --> 2:54:51.640]  the sand and they're not doing anything to prepare.
[2:54:51.640 --> 2:54:53.880]  Folks, I'm going to tell you something.
[2:54:53.880 --> 2:54:59.000]  You see the videos of people on Black Friday and how nuts they go for Chinese crap.
[2:54:59.000 --> 2:55:01.760]  What do you think is going to happen when the panic sets in?
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:02.960]  You think you're going to get water?
[2:55:02.960 --> 2:55:04.800]  You think you're going to get food?
[2:55:04.800 --> 2:55:06.040]  You're not going to be able to find it.
[2:55:06.040 --> 2:55:07.600]  You're not going to be able to get it.
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:09.800]  You need to go out now and get your water.
[2:55:09.800 --> 2:55:11.520]  You need to get your dry goods.
[2:55:11.520 --> 2:55:12.920]  You need to get toilet paper.
[2:55:12.920 --> 2:55:16.720]  You need to get everything that you need to sustain yourself for three to six months.
[2:55:16.720 --> 2:55:21.960]  And one of the best ways to do it is also to help Alex promote his program and get his
[2:55:21.960 --> 2:55:24.320]  products and they'll help you.
[2:55:24.320 --> 2:55:25.320]  That's the first thing I wanted to say.
[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:29.840]  Well, that's a great point and then hope you don't need it, but this is insurance you
[2:55:29.840 --> 2:55:30.840]  can eat.
[2:55:30.840 --> 2:55:31.840]  It's a smart move.
[2:55:31.840 --> 2:55:32.840]  Go ahead.
[2:55:32.840 --> 2:55:33.840]  All right.
[2:55:33.840 --> 2:55:38.520]  The second thing I wanted to say is, Alex, you cannot give up.
[2:55:38.520 --> 2:55:44.840]  Nobody can give up on those who are ensnared by the devil, taken captive of his will that
[2:55:44.840 --> 2:55:50.920]  are sucked in to the Democrats or into this new world odor, as I call it.
[2:55:50.920 --> 2:55:54.160]  Those people are our brothers and sisters.
[2:55:54.160 --> 2:55:55.720]  They are made in the image of God.
[2:55:55.720 --> 2:55:56.720]  They are deceived.
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:55:58.480]  Now, I don't give up on them.
[2:55:58.480 --> 2:56:00.640]  So how do you get through to them?
[2:56:00.640 --> 2:56:05.080]  You get through with them, not by judging or condemning them or calling them names or
[2:56:05.080 --> 2:56:08.760]  anything else like that, but you have to reach out through them, through meekness by the
[2:56:08.760 --> 2:56:12.340]  power of the Holy Spirit, by the spirit of repentance and love.
[2:56:12.340 --> 2:56:15.680]  You have to draw them out of it.
[2:56:15.680 --> 2:56:16.680]  That's the only way.
[2:56:16.680 --> 2:56:21.880]  And if they choose to, because they're ensnared by their choices, if they choose to listen,
[2:56:21.880 --> 2:56:23.040]  they choose to listen.
[2:56:23.040 --> 2:56:25.760]  If they don't, they reap what they sow.
[2:56:25.760 --> 2:56:27.320]  They're responsible and accountable.
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:28.320]  And there's consequences.
[2:56:28.320 --> 2:56:31.920]  And America hates those two words, responsibility and accountability.
[2:56:31.920 --> 2:56:32.920]  No, I agree with you.
[2:56:32.920 --> 2:56:34.920]  I don't see leftists laughing anymore, actually.
[2:56:34.920 --> 2:56:36.440]  They seem pretty depressed.
[2:56:36.440 --> 2:56:38.880]  So maybe how do you speak to them and say, listen, you were lied to.
[2:56:38.880 --> 2:56:39.880]  It's okay.
[2:56:39.880 --> 2:56:40.880]  I'm not perfect either.
[2:56:40.880 --> 2:56:43.600]  But here's the truth of just be loving to them, you think?
[2:56:43.600 --> 2:56:44.600]  Yes.
[2:56:44.600 --> 2:56:45.600]  Be loving to them.
[2:56:45.600 --> 2:56:51.280]  I mean, no disrespect, Alex, chanting back at them, hey, hey, hey, ho, ho, your IQ is
[2:56:51.280 --> 2:56:52.280]  mighty low.
[2:56:52.280 --> 2:56:54.200]  No, no, I'm not, believe me.
[2:56:54.200 --> 2:56:55.200]  I know it.
[2:56:55.200 --> 2:56:56.200]  Believe me.
[2:56:56.200 --> 2:56:57.200]  I get so sick of them.
[2:56:57.200 --> 2:56:58.440]  I just think you're right.
[2:56:58.440 --> 2:56:59.440]  I need to be more loving.
[2:56:59.440 --> 2:57:00.440]  I try.
[2:57:00.440 --> 2:57:03.000]  I just, I'm just some sick of them, but I'm not putting you down, dude.
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:04.000]  I'm not putting you down.
[2:57:04.000 --> 2:57:05.600]  No, I can handle it.
[2:57:05.600 --> 2:57:10.240]  Listen, I know that when somebody says F you and your children, I should say, man, what
[2:57:10.240 --> 2:57:12.600]  would make you say something about somebody's children?
[2:57:12.600 --> 2:57:13.600]  I love you.
[2:57:13.600 --> 2:57:14.600]  I'm sorry.
[2:57:14.600 --> 2:57:15.600]  I forgive you.
[2:57:15.600 --> 2:57:16.600]  They might break down.
[2:57:16.600 --> 2:57:17.600]  I could get through to them instead.
[2:57:17.600 --> 2:57:18.600]  I say, F you, let's go.
[2:57:18.600 --> 2:57:21.640]  And I need to get to the point where there's difference.
[2:57:21.640 --> 2:57:23.640]  I'm not Jesus Christ and far from it.
[2:57:23.640 --> 2:57:25.480]  I want to be Christ like I'm not.
[2:57:25.480 --> 2:57:26.480]  I love God though.
[2:57:26.480 --> 2:57:27.480]  God knows that.
[2:57:27.480 --> 2:57:28.480]  There's a connection.
[2:57:28.480 --> 2:57:30.320]  So I don't give in to the globalist tyranny.
[2:57:30.320 --> 2:57:33.240]  That's my strength, but I am not good on the Christ like him.
[2:57:33.240 --> 2:57:34.240]  I agree with you.
[2:57:34.240 --> 2:57:35.240]  Stay there.
[2:57:35.240 --> 2:57:36.240]  Thank you, Levi.
[2:57:36.240 --> 2:57:37.240]  Robert Barnes.
[2:57:37.240 --> 2:57:46.120]  Robert, infowars.com, newswars.com, George Soros hopes you don't share those URLs.
[2:57:46.120 --> 2:57:53.520]  I spend a lot of time reminding the info wars family of listeners and viewers that without
[2:57:53.520 --> 2:57:57.040]  you, we won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you.
[2:57:57.040 --> 2:58:01.200]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing
[2:58:01.200 --> 2:58:04.360]  the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres.
[2:58:04.360 --> 2:58:10.240]  And something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:11.240]  really amazing.
[2:58:11.240 --> 2:58:15.160]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air
[2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:19.920]  filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find

[2:58:30.600 --> 2:58:37.680]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[2:58:37.680 --> 2:58:41.240]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[2:59:32.400 --> 2:59:33.600]  That's why people get so sick.
[2:59:33.600 --> 2:59:34.600]  That's the main reason.

[2:59:49.080 --> 3:00:03.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:03.200 --> 3:00:04.200]  I love John Petty.
[3:00:04.200 --> 3:00:07.600]  His music's so great, but I'm going to have to fade it down to go to your phone calls.
[3:00:07.600 --> 3:00:13.480]  It's a great song though, but a good strong pretty girl growing up midwest.
[3:00:13.480 --> 3:00:14.480]  Here it is.
[3:00:14.480 --> 3:00:16.480]  I said I wouldn't fade it down.
[3:00:16.480 --> 3:00:23.480]  She grew up in an Indiana town, had a good looking mother, never was around, but she
[3:00:23.480 --> 3:00:29.800]  grew up tall and she grew up right with them Indiana boys on an Indiana night.
[3:00:29.800 --> 3:00:36.800]  We're up strong, we're up right, we end up Indiana boys on Saturday night.
[3:00:36.800 --> 3:00:40.680]  All right, that's another Tom Petty.
[3:00:40.680 --> 3:00:46.080]  You know, I don't tell the story to be a victim, no, in fact I'm an overcomer, but
[3:00:46.080 --> 3:00:48.480]  it happened in Virginia a few times.
[3:00:48.480 --> 3:00:49.800]  It happens in Austin all the time.
[3:00:49.800 --> 3:00:50.800]  It happens when I'm out.
[3:00:50.800 --> 3:00:53.800]  I'm right in front of my security guys.
[3:00:53.800 --> 3:01:00.760]  This guy walks up and he goes, how's it going with your family, F you and your family, screw
[3:01:00.760 --> 3:01:07.840]  you and your family, and I always go, let's go, let's go, and I'm a guy that's pretty
[3:01:07.840 --> 3:01:12.480]  much in control of myself most of the time, but when somebody calls my family out, it's
[3:01:12.480 --> 3:01:17.920]  just instinctive, but I should just say, man, why do you Democrats hate children so much
[3:01:17.920 --> 3:01:18.920]  in families?
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:21.920]  I forgive you, you need Christ.
[3:01:21.920 --> 3:01:26.040]  It really is true, but Barnes, what's wrong with the left today?
[3:01:26.040 --> 3:01:27.280]  Why do they hate families?
[3:01:27.280 --> 3:01:28.800]  Why do they hate children?
[3:01:28.800 --> 3:01:33.600]  Why do they not play by basic chivalry rules, which by the way, they're losing.
[3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:35.680]  I mean, they don't get chivalries there for a reason.
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:36.680]  What's wrong with them?
[3:01:36.680 --> 3:01:40.840]  Well, it's sort of the curse of the collective, that when you lose yourself in some collective
[3:01:40.840 --> 3:01:46.480]  identity, you lose any respect for individuals and particularly the most vulnerable individuals.
[3:01:46.480 --> 3:01:48.840]  And so I think that's part of the mentality and the mindset.
[3:01:48.840 --> 3:01:52.480]  That's where you have people making like one of those horrific abortion videos where they
[3:01:52.480 --> 3:01:56.680]  set up the video to say, oh, I'm going in to figure out whether it's a boy or a girl.
[3:01:56.680 --> 3:02:02.160]  And then they make fun of the fact that they got a child aborted, that that's the gender.
[3:02:02.160 --> 3:02:05.840]  So it's that kind of mindset that's very sort of divorced from a certain deep humanism.
[3:02:05.840 --> 3:02:08.840]  And I go, this little bastard thinks he's about to have a life.
[3:02:08.840 --> 3:02:11.560]  No, I'm about to chop him up.
[3:02:11.560 --> 3:02:14.840]  They're making a sick joke off killing their own baby.
[3:02:14.840 --> 3:02:15.840]  Exactly.
[3:02:15.840 --> 3:02:20.000]  It's the sort of cognitive dissonance of and morally disturbing nature of people that
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:23.480]  are disconnected from humanism and humanity.
[3:02:23.480 --> 3:02:29.280]  And it's no surprise that so many of that ideology flock to the tech world.
[3:02:29.280 --> 3:02:34.280]  It's a world that's sort of divorced and disconnected from individuals, from the basic principles
[3:02:34.280 --> 3:02:38.200]  and precepts of humanity, and don't care about the most vulnerable people around them.
[3:02:38.200 --> 3:02:45.520]  Instead, they sort of idolatry as power and become part, love the collective, the notion
[3:02:45.520 --> 3:02:49.840]  and nature of ideas, and thus are drawn to things that always have a collective or state
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:50.840]  of service.
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:53.840]  And they know we have families, so they attack those great point, Patty in Texas, you're
[3:02:53.840 --> 3:02:54.840]  on the air.
[3:02:54.840 --> 3:02:55.840]  Go ahead.
[3:02:55.840 --> 3:02:56.840]  Hey, Alex.
[3:02:56.840 --> 3:02:57.840]  How are you doing today?
[3:02:57.840 --> 3:02:58.840]  Good.
[3:02:58.840 --> 3:02:59.840]  We got two minutes.
[3:02:59.840 --> 3:03:00.840]  Thanks for holding.
[3:03:00.840 --> 3:03:01.840]  We love you.
[3:03:01.840 --> 3:03:02.840]  Go ahead.
[3:03:02.840 --> 3:03:07.440]  A couple of points I want to make about the coronavirus and where that's going to hit
[3:03:07.440 --> 3:03:08.440]  Trump.
[3:03:08.440 --> 3:03:19.080]  Over the last 20 years or so, the American businesses have fled from the United States
[3:03:19.080 --> 3:03:25.000]  to China, India, Mexico, that sort of thing, but a huge number of them landed in China.
[3:03:25.000 --> 3:03:30.240]  Well, with the virus hitting, all those companies are being shut down.
[3:03:30.240 --> 3:03:33.640]  So they're going to have to come back to the United States because of the destruction
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:35.440]  that's going on over there.
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:38.640]  Well, the Dems aren't going to like that.
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:42.280]  That's going to affect our economy and boost our economy.
[3:03:42.280 --> 3:03:48.320]  So what they're going to do with the virus is what I think they're going to do with
[3:03:48.320 --> 3:03:53.920]  the Democrats is they're going to do everything to push that virus to come in the United States
[3:03:53.920 --> 3:03:59.840]  and start destroying, killing people here in massive amounts in the same sort of way
[3:03:59.840 --> 3:04:01.880]  that's going on in China.
[3:04:01.880 --> 3:04:08.400]  That's going to affect, I think, the timetable for that is this summer.
[3:04:08.400 --> 3:04:14.680]  I think they have it so they can figure out about how much, how this spreads at the rate
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:16.040]  of it spread.
[3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:21.480]  And I bet that this summer, we're going to see an explosion of deaths and this virus
[3:04:21.480 --> 3:04:23.480]  here in the United States.
[3:04:23.480 --> 3:04:28.760]  So by the fall, they're going to have to call in martial law.
[3:04:28.760 --> 3:04:33.600]  All that's going to make Trump look like a Trump, but he can't control things and he
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:34.600]  doesn't know what he's doing.
[3:04:34.600 --> 3:04:35.600]  Is that for a thing?
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:36.600]  I agree.
[3:04:36.600 --> 3:04:38.840]  The biggest threat to Trump is crashing the economy.
[3:04:38.840 --> 3:04:39.840]  Thank you, Patty.
[3:04:39.840 --> 3:04:40.840]  Call me back tomorrow.
[3:04:40.840 --> 3:04:41.840]  Aaron, Eric, Neil, Todd, I apologize.
[3:04:41.840 --> 3:04:42.840]  We're out of time.
[3:04:42.840 --> 3:04:44.840]  That's a lot of calls.
[3:04:44.840 --> 3:04:50.000]  I want to hear what Barnes wants to cover on the Democrats and more and what's coming
[3:04:50.000 --> 3:04:52.000]  up with these caucuses straight ahead.
[3:04:52.000 --> 3:04:54.400]  We'll be right back.
[3:04:54.400 --> 3:04:59.640]  National War's Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[3:04:59.640 --> 3:05:04.800]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[3:05:04.800 --> 3:05:11.680]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[3:05:11.680 --> 3:05:17.560]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[3:05:17.560 --> 3:05:20.840]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[3:05:20.840 --> 3:05:25.800]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later, we now have the fruit
[3:05:25.800 --> 3:05:30.840]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[3:05:30.840 --> 3:05:32.340]  symptoms.
[3:05:32.340 --> 3:05:34.520]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[3:05:34.520 --> 3:05:35.520]  It is not an antihistamine.
[3:05:35.520 --> 3:05:40.440]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[3:05:40.440 --> 3:05:46.240]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[3:05:46.240 --> 3:05:48.960]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[3:05:48.960 --> 3:05:58.960]  Write to InfowarsLife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[3:05:58.960 --> 3:06:09.400]  All right, constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is about to take over the next two segments
[3:06:09.400 --> 3:06:15.400]  of drill salintation ready in the war room after that.
[3:06:15.400 --> 3:06:21.440]  I hope this virus isn't as bad as it looks like it is, but I just see Providence at work
[3:06:21.440 --> 3:06:28.880]  again that we have the nano-silver that it turns out in 2007 was certified by the Pentagon
[3:06:28.880 --> 3:06:34.280]  by A&M and Homeland Security Letters to take out the SARS coronavirus family.
[3:06:34.280 --> 3:06:38.640]  But I use it as immune gargle so I can gargle it out, spit part of it out, you can drink
[3:06:38.640 --> 3:06:41.160]  part of it, you can drink it all if you want.
[3:06:41.160 --> 3:06:46.120]  Is it 15 parts per million, but it's a nano-silver, we sold out of the 16 ounce, we're going to
[3:06:46.120 --> 3:06:50.400]  sell out of the 3 ounce and the 1 ounce very, very soon.
[3:06:50.400 --> 3:06:54.640]  And I'm going to keep it at 40% off, even though it's very close to selling out for
[3:06:54.640 --> 3:06:55.640]  another two days.
[3:06:55.640 --> 3:07:00.120]  But then it was pointed out to me that, oh, you're going to sell out of it at 40% off,
[3:07:00.120 --> 3:07:03.720]  even though we make like 30, 40% of that, we've got to buy more of it.
[3:07:03.720 --> 3:07:05.080]  I'm like, whoa.
[3:07:05.080 --> 3:07:10.640]  So it's going to go back to regular price by Wednesday or Thursday, and we'll still
[3:07:10.640 --> 3:07:15.360]  sell out of it long before we get more in, it'll take a month or more, because I'm already
[3:07:15.360 --> 3:07:19.920]  putting in the order and that takes money for the 16 ounce, the 3 ounce, the 1 ounce.
[3:07:19.920 --> 3:07:27.360]  Put the order in, actually on Friday, paid 50% down, and they explained to me, they said,
[3:07:27.360 --> 3:07:31.320]  you understand it, 40% off, we don't even make the money back reordering it.
[3:07:31.320 --> 3:07:34.720]  You have to have profit to fund things, and I said, okay, you're right.
[3:07:34.720 --> 3:07:39.520]  And I'll go to a Wednesday at 40% off, and then for folks that get the last few thousand
[3:07:39.520 --> 3:07:44.880]  bottles at 1 ounce and the last few bottles at 3 ounce, that'll help buy the next lot
[3:07:44.880 --> 3:07:46.280]  of it to even have it.
[3:07:46.280 --> 3:07:53.240]  So infowarstore.com, infowarslife.com, your immune gargle with nano silver, also their
[3:07:53.240 --> 3:07:55.160]  wound gel is even stronger.
[3:07:55.160 --> 3:07:58.960]  Don't ingest this same nano silver, but the strongest over the counter you can find.
[3:07:58.960 --> 3:08:04.400]  And all of the super blue and super silver whitening toothpaste has that nano silver
[3:08:04.400 --> 3:08:05.400]  as well.
[3:08:05.400 --> 3:08:08.800]  It's just good for you overall, really good for your body, good for your gums, and it
[3:08:08.800 --> 3:08:10.160]  funds the info war.
[3:08:10.160 --> 3:08:13.600]  And we're selling out of the storeable food, but it's still available, you can still get
[3:08:13.600 --> 3:08:21.800]  it, but now time to take action infowarstore.com, or triple A 253 3139.
[3:08:21.800 --> 3:08:24.440]  And again, most storeable food companies are already sold out.
[3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:28.580]  We still have it at the same high quality, low prices.
[3:08:28.580 --> 3:08:33.000]  So that's how you fund the info or get prepared infowarstore.com, but whatever you do, please
[3:08:33.000 --> 3:08:37.120]  get prepared spiritually and get close to God because 2020 is one hell of a year.
[3:08:37.120 --> 3:08:40.840]  All right, for the balance of this segment, the next Robert Barnes takes over constitutional
[3:08:40.840 --> 3:08:45.720]  lawyer and then Gerald Solente, please stay with us.
[3:08:45.720 --> 3:08:55.240]  Barnes, hey, how the, I think key parts as we look up to the New Hampshire primary elections
[3:08:55.240 --> 3:08:59.960]  coming up this tomorrow, the tomorrow evening, where we'll get the results back.
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:02.520]  There's multiple storylines at play.
[3:09:02.520 --> 3:09:07.680]  Most people focus on the horse race storyline or focused on who's going to win or who's
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:11.520]  going to get the nomination, who's going to be the potential opponent to President Trump.
[3:09:11.520 --> 3:09:14.440]  But there are other critical storylines equally in play.
[3:09:14.440 --> 3:09:17.520]  For example, there is everything that happened in Iowa and whether what happened in Iowa
[3:09:17.520 --> 3:09:22.640]  will effectively contaminate and infect the New Hampshire primary process.
[3:09:22.640 --> 3:09:26.720]  What happened in Iowa looks increasingly like corruption and fraud.
[3:09:26.720 --> 3:09:29.760]  It looks like an election that's been rigged by somebody.
[3:09:29.760 --> 3:09:35.320]  And the question only now is who and why the, so one storyline will be to what degree does
[3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:40.280]  Pete Buttigieg or however you pronounce his name, how, how well does he do in New Hampshire?
[3:09:40.280 --> 3:09:45.240]  Because before Iowa, before he got the fake news storyline of him coming in first, where
[3:09:45.240 --> 3:09:49.040]  it's now been confirmed that at least in terms of popular vote, he came in second in the
[3:09:49.040 --> 3:09:53.360]  first alignment and second in the second alignment, second by every form of popular
[3:09:53.360 --> 3:09:58.920]  vote that took place and he himself propounds that he is a popular vote proponent for all
[3:09:58.920 --> 3:09:59.920]  elections.
[3:09:59.920 --> 3:10:04.080]  And yet here he took credit for an election where he lost the popular vote, he claimed
[3:10:04.080 --> 3:10:05.080]  he won it.
[3:10:05.080 --> 3:10:09.560]  Will he get a boost out of New Hampshire where he was originally fourth or even fifth in
[3:10:09.560 --> 3:10:14.320]  the polls prior to the fake news out of Iowa that he won Iowa?
[3:10:14.320 --> 3:10:16.280]  So that's one storyline taking place.
[3:10:16.280 --> 3:10:20.640]  A second storyline is taking place internally, whether or not Joe Biden will continue to
[3:10:20.640 --> 3:10:21.880]  collapse.
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:27.400]  For example, the if Biden cannot sustain any kind of momentum out of either Iowa or New
[3:10:27.400 --> 3:10:32.480]  Hampshire and partially there again, there have been allegations and accusations that
[3:10:32.480 --> 3:10:38.680]  the reason why the caucus results were not reported accurately is because partially because
[3:10:38.680 --> 3:10:45.240]  to help Buttigieg look like he won, but also to for people to not know how badly Joe Biden
[3:10:45.240 --> 3:10:46.240]  did.
[3:10:46.240 --> 3:10:47.240]  Biden was collapsing.
[3:10:47.240 --> 3:10:49.200]  He was falling through the floor.
[3:10:49.200 --> 3:10:54.120]  And what's notable there in the context of Iowa is that you have not only what is happening
[3:10:54.120 --> 3:11:00.560]  in terms of the caucuses, but just the weekend before the famous Iowa poll done by Ann Seltzer
[3:11:00.560 --> 3:11:07.680]  that was to be reported by the Des Moines Register and CNN and Samarily got canceled
[3:11:07.680 --> 3:11:08.800]  out of the blue.
[3:11:08.800 --> 3:11:10.120]  What did that poll show?
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:14.480]  That poll showed Joe Biden collapsing and it showed momentum for Elizabeth Warren rather
[3:11:14.480 --> 3:11:16.000]  than Pete Buttigieg.
[3:11:16.000 --> 3:11:17.000]  And what would that have meant?
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:21.600]  That meant the two establishment candidates, Biden and Buttigieg, would have been gone.
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:26.400]  So in order to get rid of that probability so that Mayor Pete could look like a winner
[3:11:26.400 --> 3:11:30.960]  so that he could have momentum that was fake momentum generated by the suppression of public
[3:11:30.960 --> 3:11:36.760]  opinion results, you had a second effect of that by suppressing the popular vote results
[3:11:36.760 --> 3:11:42.000]  to make it look like Mayor Pete had won, but instead it was likely Bernie Sanders who
[3:11:42.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  won.
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:46.600]  Now he gets to carry that into New Hampshire and while in part and then the suppression
[3:11:46.600 --> 3:11:52.280]  of the information about how poorly Joe Biden was doing kept him afloat and alive in New
[3:11:52.280 --> 3:11:54.800]  Hampshire long enough maybe to survive.
[3:11:54.800 --> 3:11:56.480]  He might finish third.
[3:11:56.480 --> 3:11:58.640]  He might even finish or at least in the top four.
[3:11:58.640 --> 3:12:05.720]  A fifth place finish would be a disaster, a finish with no delegates at all and 15 percent
[3:12:05.720 --> 3:12:10.200]  is required to get any delegates out of New Hampshire would be a second hit, a second
[3:12:10.200 --> 3:12:15.540]  successive hit that may take away his momentum and the perception of front leading and front
[3:12:15.540 --> 3:12:20.740]  running that was necessary for him to get popular support, given the lack of organic
[3:12:20.740 --> 3:12:22.960]  authentic popular support.
[3:12:22.960 --> 3:12:28.600]  Remember Joe Biden has run in two prior Democratic presidential campaigns and has never won
[3:12:28.600 --> 3:12:33.680]  any election in any of those presidential campaigns in the primary stage.
[3:12:33.680 --> 3:12:36.920]  So here he again, he continues to lose and lose.
[3:12:36.920 --> 3:12:38.600]  What will happen in New Hampshire?
[3:12:38.600 --> 3:12:42.880]  Did Iowa's lack of reporting that the suppression of the poll results, that the suppression
[3:12:42.880 --> 3:12:49.400]  of the caucus popular vote results save Joe Biden as well as boost Mayor Pete or as they
[3:12:49.400 --> 3:12:53.640]  call him in the Bernie camp, Mayor Cheat or Wall Street Pete?
[3:12:53.640 --> 3:12:58.040]  So those will be two key factors to be looking for how much the corruption of what took place
[3:12:58.040 --> 3:13:03.040]  by the Democratic Party in Iowa has contaminated the New Hampshire results and we'll know that
[3:13:03.040 --> 3:13:06.520]  only when those results come back in.
[3:13:06.520 --> 3:13:11.200]  The next thing to look at is the degree to which the various campaign attacks on Pete
[3:13:11.200 --> 3:13:15.040]  Buttigieg will undermine his success in New Hampshire.
[3:13:15.040 --> 3:13:19.960]  Will the corruption and collusion that took place in New Hampshire in Iowa not be enough
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:24.620]  to say to boost his campaign to electable status in New Hampshire?
[3:13:24.620 --> 3:13:29.280]  He really needs to win or at least finish a competitive second.
[3:13:29.280 --> 3:13:35.040]  If he is unable to do that, then his campaign may be over because he has a candidate with
[3:13:35.040 --> 3:13:36.400]  a very thin resume.
[3:13:36.400 --> 3:13:41.680]  The attack on him is when Trump is watching because Trump is going to replicate that attack
[3:13:41.680 --> 3:13:46.680]  if Mayor Pete in fact becomes a Democratic nominee.
[3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:50.840]  And that attack is making fun of the fact that he has had no experience doing anything
[3:13:50.840 --> 3:13:52.000]  of consequence.
[3:13:52.000 --> 3:13:56.960]  Unlike Trump who had built a global brand and a global business and a global TV network,
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:14:02.760]  you have someone like Buttigieg, all he's ever done is basically be a mayor of a small
[3:14:02.760 --> 3:14:08.240]  college town and by all appearances a failed mayor of a small college town.
[3:14:08.240 --> 3:14:12.240]  So you have someone he's never been a governor, he's never been a statewide elected official,
[3:14:12.240 --> 3:14:16.200]  he's never had major executive background, either in the private sector or the public
[3:14:16.200 --> 3:14:17.200]  sector.
[3:14:17.200 --> 3:14:21.120]  In fact, his whole background reads like a tailor made like somebody else was making
[3:14:21.120 --> 3:14:22.760]  him for a candidacy.
[3:14:22.760 --> 3:14:24.680]  He reads like Macron in France.
[3:14:24.680 --> 3:14:26.640]  He reads like Trudeau in Canada.
[3:14:26.640 --> 3:14:32.640]  He reads like Obama in here, except with even weaker background proof and documents and
[3:14:32.640 --> 3:14:33.640]  information.
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:40.720]  He goes off to, he's the son of a Gromsky scholar, Gromsky was a prominent far left historian
[3:14:40.720 --> 3:14:42.000]  and analyst.
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:48.240]  He celebrated when he was younger, Bernie Sanders as an ideal sort of cloak mask in disguise
[3:14:48.240 --> 3:14:53.440]  kind of candidate, how to be a far left individual, a far left status, but disguise your far left
[3:14:53.440 --> 3:14:56.080]  status into something other than what it is.
[3:14:56.080 --> 3:15:03.120]  Then he gets a weird commission right into the army, right into the armed forces without
[3:15:03.120 --> 3:15:09.480]  any basic training, without having to go through any sort of protocol that it has to, when
[3:15:09.480 --> 3:15:12.480]  the only other people to achieve that benefit was Hunter Biden.
[3:15:12.480 --> 3:15:13.480]  Is that coincidental?
[3:15:13.480 --> 3:15:17.720]  Appears to be connected to CIA spook operations in Afghanistan and this is only real going
[3:15:17.720 --> 3:15:19.800]  to quote military activity.
[3:15:19.800 --> 3:15:23.240]  That has its own problematic backdrop.
[3:15:23.240 --> 3:15:25.480]  He's the number one favorite candidate of the billionaires.
[3:15:25.480 --> 3:15:29.800]  He's the, they call him Wall Street Pete, because half of his big billionaire donors
[3:15:29.800 --> 3:15:33.600]  are connected to Wall Street in an institutional and influential way.
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:35.880]  Has a lot of deep state ties.
[3:15:35.880 --> 3:15:39.440]  He was connected to the app that somehow went bad in Iowa.
[3:15:39.440 --> 3:15:42.840]  He's also connected to the app that may go bad in Nevada.
[3:15:42.840 --> 3:15:46.720]  So when we come back, we'll talk about how to interpret the New Hampshire results, but
[3:15:46.720 --> 3:15:51.800]  also looking forward to Nevada, if you think Iowa was corruption, wait till you see the
[3:15:51.800 --> 3:15:56.760]  Nevada caucuses, we can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[3:17:51.880 --> 3:17:59.840]  If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate infowars, it's because
[3:17:59.840 --> 3:18:06.360]  we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate and we're not giving up.
[3:18:06.360 --> 3:18:11.120]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new order's plans to
[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:15.880]  not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:20.280]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[3:18:20.280 --> 3:18:24.320]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side and they do what they do
[3:18:24.320 --> 3:18:30.240]  because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and
[3:18:30.240 --> 3:18:31.800]  destroy the innocent.
[3:18:31.800 --> 3:18:37.680]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheep dogs to
[3:18:37.680 --> 3:18:41.720]  stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[3:18:41.720 --> 3:18:47.360]  They fear the fact that we are awake, they fear the fact that we are alive, they fear
[3:18:47.360 --> 3:18:55.720]  the fact that we love God and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[3:18:55.720 --> 3:18:58.880]  This should really be easier than it is.
[3:18:58.880 --> 3:19:03.880]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch, I'm pointing out the way forward, things that
[3:19:03.880 --> 3:19:10.240]  I discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself,

[3:19:20.280 --> 3:19:25.720]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[3:19:25.720 --> 3:19:30.320]  the bad halogen and people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so
[3:19:30.320 --> 3:19:36.640]  thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true
[3:19:36.640 --> 3:19:39.120]  iodine, atomic iodine.
[3:19:39.120 --> 3:19:44.920]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you

[3:19:51.160 --> 3:19:58.000]  win, you can't lose unless you don't take action.
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:20:17.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:17.480 --> 3:20:19.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show here on Info Wars.
[3:20:19.880 --> 3:20:23.600]  We were discussing what to look forward to tomorrow in New Hampshire, how to translate
[3:20:23.600 --> 3:20:26.120]  and interpret the information and the results.
[3:20:26.120 --> 3:20:29.960]  Whatever that's going to be, how does Bernie Sanders do, has the Democratic establishment
[3:20:29.960 --> 3:20:33.160]  been able to take him out because of what happened in Iowa?
[3:20:33.160 --> 3:20:37.360]  It looks like they have been unsuccessful in doing so but they may have their second
[3:20:37.360 --> 3:20:42.160]  backup strategy in play by having a diverse number of second and third and fourth and
[3:20:42.160 --> 3:20:47.840]  fifth candidates who can be competitive long term to deny him a majority of the delegates
[3:20:47.840 --> 3:20:53.200]  that would allow for a contested convention in Milwaukee and the last contested convention
[3:20:53.200 --> 3:20:59.520]  we had meaningfully really was 1968 where Hubert Humphrey came in after Robert Kennedy
[3:20:59.520 --> 3:21:04.320]  had been shot, killed, Hubert Humphrey came in and sort of swept up the contested convention
[3:21:04.320 --> 3:21:10.220]  even though he had won very few primaries or votes and then the primary process.
[3:21:10.220 --> 3:21:14.760]  Back then, most of the states did not participate in primaries or caucuses so that's a relatively
[3:21:14.760 --> 3:21:15.760]  new phenomenon.
[3:21:15.760 --> 3:21:18.240]  That's a phenomenon since the 1980s.
[3:21:18.240 --> 3:21:23.360]  So in the modern era, since the 1980s, this would be the first ever contested convention
[3:21:23.360 --> 3:21:27.360]  where one person does not have a majority of delegates or close enough that everybody
[3:21:27.360 --> 3:21:29.680]  feels comfortable that they'll win the nomination.
[3:21:29.680 --> 3:21:34.440]  So if they're able, stage one is to have Bernie lose tonight from the establishment's perspective.
[3:21:34.440 --> 3:21:40.440]  If not, step two is to have him not win enough votes that he's on pace to win a majority
[3:21:40.440 --> 3:21:44.320]  of the delegates, to have enough second and third and fourth place candidates who get
[3:21:44.320 --> 3:21:49.600]  at least 15% of the vote to eat away at the delegate advantage that Bernie could establish
[3:21:49.600 --> 3:21:52.680]  and to maintain that as a momentum going forward.
[3:21:52.680 --> 3:21:55.000]  Also to try to deter his momentum moving forward.
[3:21:55.000 --> 3:22:00.680]  So we'll know a lot about what Iowa's corruption meant by what happens in New Hampshire tomorrow
[3:22:00.680 --> 3:22:01.680]  night.
[3:22:01.680 --> 3:22:06.680]  We'll also see to what degree the deep state's favorite candidate, Mayor Pete or Pete Buttededge
[3:22:06.680 --> 3:22:13.480]  as the mayor, to what degree does he finish well?
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:16.120]  There are polls that showed him neck and neck with Bernie Sanders.
[3:22:16.120 --> 3:22:18.840]  Is he going to be there or is he going to fall substantially back?
[3:22:18.840 --> 3:22:23.240]  Those have been following the various electoral betting advice and analysis that we've been
[3:22:23.240 --> 3:22:27.920]  providing here at InfoWars have made a lot of money since the summer in terms of betting
[3:22:27.920 --> 3:22:32.240]  on Bernie when he was low, betting against Warren when she was high.
[3:22:32.240 --> 3:22:37.360]  And now the advice that we're making or that I'm making is if you're going to short somebody,
[3:22:37.360 --> 3:22:39.680]  short Bloomberg, he's overvalued in the polls.
[3:22:39.680 --> 3:22:47.120]  The Democratic Party will never allow Mike Bloomberg to steal the nomination.
[3:22:47.120 --> 3:22:49.680]  His corruption is not of a Hillary kind of corruption.
[3:22:49.680 --> 3:22:54.360]  He's an outsider trying to co-op the Democratic Party, both the insiders who want to protect
[3:22:54.360 --> 3:22:58.040]  their corruption and the outsiders who despise the billionaires.
[3:22:58.040 --> 3:23:03.440]  That coalition will stop and prevent Bloomberg from ever being nominated in the Democratic
[3:23:03.440 --> 3:23:04.440]  Party.
[3:23:04.440 --> 3:23:10.600]  For many me, he's actually like five, three, or five, four, that's why he used the many
[3:23:10.600 --> 3:23:15.200]  me box that President Trump mocked him for that Scott Adams is going to start marketing
[3:23:15.200 --> 3:23:18.280]  the little but the Bloomberg box to make yourself look taller.
[3:23:18.280 --> 3:23:23.240]  He's spending an unprecedented amount of money, but that's a lot like Jeb Bush in 2016 who
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:25.760]  spent over $100 million and went nowhere.
[3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:27.880]  So Bloomberg is likely to get votes.
[3:23:27.880 --> 3:23:28.880]  What is his objective?
[3:23:28.880 --> 3:23:29.880]  What is his goal?
[3:23:29.880 --> 3:23:35.080]  His goal is to get enough votes that he gets some delegates that he crushes that 15% threshold
[3:23:35.080 --> 3:23:40.120]  in some voter rich states, some delegate rich states, so that he can become a kingmaker.
[3:23:40.120 --> 3:23:41.120]  Not to be the king.
[3:23:41.120 --> 3:23:44.120]  I think he knows there's no, he would love to be the king, but there's no chance it's
[3:23:44.120 --> 3:23:45.360]  ever going to happen.
[3:23:45.360 --> 3:23:49.720]  So instead what he's hoping for is enough power so that he can be a kingmaker and prevent
[3:23:49.720 --> 3:23:51.760]  Bernie from getting the nomination.
[3:23:51.760 --> 3:23:55.560]  So part of what watching New Hampshire tomorrow is seeing if enough people are eating into
[3:23:55.560 --> 3:24:02.000]  Bernie's vote, that Bernie's under 30% and enough people get 15% because that would forecast
[3:24:02.000 --> 3:24:06.520]  and foreshadow that what's going to be happening is that Bloomberg will start getting 15%.
[3:24:06.520 --> 3:24:12.800]  Steyer will get 15% in some states and we're looking at an increasing risk of a contested
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:15.120]  convention from the Democratic Party side.
[3:24:15.120 --> 3:24:20.040]  And that'll be the first kind of its time in the modern era of national primaries and
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:21.040]  caucuses.
[3:24:21.040 --> 3:24:25.080]  The next thing to look at is who else does well in New Hampshire?
[3:24:25.080 --> 3:24:27.440]  Buttigieg needs to do well in order to survive.
[3:24:27.440 --> 3:24:29.920]  His base is an upscale white base.
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:35.240]  The key factor there that has hurt him and impaired his campaign is that he's such a
[3:24:35.240 --> 3:24:40.080]  vanilla guy that has such vague sort of McKinsey cult consulting where he comes from kind
[3:24:40.080 --> 3:24:41.080]  of language.
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:44.880]  He says something that's nothing about something that's nothing about nothing about something.
[3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:48.200]  And at the end of it, you're like, hold on a second, he really didn't say anything.
[3:24:48.200 --> 3:24:49.200]  And that's who he is.
[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:50.200]  That's what he is.
[3:24:50.200 --> 3:24:52.280]  That gets exposed the more he's on stage.
[3:24:52.280 --> 3:24:55.160]  And on top of that, Joe Biden went after him.
[3:24:55.160 --> 3:24:59.400]  He may have peaked a little too soon and Biden is unwilling to concede to the deep state
[3:24:59.400 --> 3:25:03.960]  apparatus their own institutional interest because he put his neck out for all of the
[3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:07.400]  political establishment by even running in the first place.
[3:25:07.400 --> 3:25:13.480]  He went after him within a very effective political act that just documented the degree
[3:25:13.480 --> 3:25:19.160]  to which he had Mayor Pete has done has been Mayor Small, not only physically, but in
[3:25:19.160 --> 3:25:21.360]  terms of his public policy record.
[3:25:21.360 --> 3:25:25.720]  What it showed is that in fact, the edge basically mocked him because the biggest achievements
[3:25:25.720 --> 3:25:29.760]  he had was putting decorative lights under the bridge, putting decorative bricks along
[3:25:29.760 --> 3:25:34.680]  the sidewalk, you know, firing the African American police chief, firing the African
[3:25:34.680 --> 3:25:36.560]  American fire chief.
[3:25:36.560 --> 3:25:39.640]  So in a democratic primary process where a quarter of the all votes are going to be
[3:25:39.640 --> 3:25:44.480]  African American voters, where no candidate has won the Democratic nomination since African
[3:25:44.480 --> 3:25:51.320]  American voters joined the primary process in full in 1976, except for when Jesse Jackson
[3:25:51.320 --> 3:25:53.600]  ran African American voters.
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:25:57.760]  Favorite candidate has been the Democratic nominee in every other nomination.
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:01.160]  And so the goal is to sort of take him out amongst African Americans as well, but clearly
[3:26:01.160 --> 3:26:05.280]  he started to be impaired by Amy Klobacher and other attacks on him in the debate.
[3:26:05.280 --> 3:26:08.960]  And so the net effect of that is, will he be able to survive that if he finishes a distant
[3:26:08.960 --> 3:26:15.480]  second or finishes even a below second, then his campaign is likely effectively over in
[3:26:15.480 --> 3:26:19.400]  the deep state's effort to co-opt and and sneak a candidate into the Democratic Party
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:26.120]  establishment in the Trudeau, Macron, Obama style will have faltered and failed.
[3:26:26.120 --> 3:26:28.000]  And that'll be good news for everybody.
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:31.520]  The other factor is will Joe Biden's collapse continue?
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:35.520]  From the Trump side of the equation, they want Biden out, they want either someone,
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:38.440]  they really don't necessarily want someone like Bernie, they want a contested convention
[3:26:38.440 --> 3:26:43.920]  that leads to a Hillary or Elizabeth Warren kind of compromise candidate.
[3:26:43.920 --> 3:26:45.640]  That's what they want to have happen.
[3:26:45.640 --> 3:26:48.040]  They don't necessarily, they don't mind if they face Bloomberg, but they don't think
[3:26:48.040 --> 3:26:49.480]  that's a realistic risk.
[3:26:49.480 --> 3:26:53.840]  They don't mind if they face Tom Steyer, but they don't think that's a realistic risk.
[3:26:53.840 --> 3:26:58.240]  They don't mind if they face Biden, but they don't see that as a realistic risk.
[3:26:58.240 --> 3:27:03.000]  And they do mind if they face Bernie Sanders, contrary to conventional wisdom, as Trump
[3:27:03.000 --> 3:27:08.040]  was found was recorded on tape recently came out that he the reason why he has real, you
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:14.440]  know, he has some reasonable concern over Bernie Sanders is that Bernie Sanders voters,
[3:27:14.440 --> 3:27:18.560]  a lot of them are Bernie or bus voters, that if Bernie is not the nominee, there's a bunch
[3:27:18.560 --> 3:27:21.800]  of people that will not even vote or will vote third party.
[3:27:21.800 --> 3:27:26.760]  And that's why what the ideal scenario for Trump is a contested convention that rigs
[3:27:26.760 --> 3:27:29.040]  the election against Bernie again.
[3:27:29.040 --> 3:27:32.680]  That's why you're seeing that mantra come out from Trump, from Trump Jr., from Steve
[3:27:32.680 --> 3:27:35.880]  Bannon, from other participants in the Trump universe.
[3:27:35.880 --> 3:27:39.720]  Their ideal scenario is that Bernie gets shafted again.
[3:27:39.720 --> 3:27:42.960]  So that will be another interesting dynamic to watch and observe.
[3:27:42.960 --> 3:27:46.160]  And all of this is leading to the next set of elections, and that's going to be in the
[3:27:46.160 --> 3:27:48.600]  caucuses in the state of Nevada.
[3:27:48.600 --> 3:27:50.680]  So again, you have caucuses.
[3:27:50.680 --> 3:27:52.520]  And then in this time, who do you have?
[3:27:52.520 --> 3:27:54.200]  You have Nevada.
[3:27:54.200 --> 3:27:59.840]  Now Nevada is to Iowa, what Chicago is to New York.
[3:27:59.840 --> 3:28:04.840]  So that is to say that the Iowa caucuses are an embarrassment of apparent collusion and
[3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:05.840]  corruption.
[3:28:05.840 --> 3:28:12.940]  This time around, arguably in 2016 and some past elections do, but that pales in comparison
[3:28:12.940 --> 3:28:17.200]  to Nevada in the same way that whatever the New York's political corruption pales in comparison
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:18.720]  to the city of Chicago.
[3:28:18.720 --> 3:28:21.560]  Some of the same connect, they're going to use an app there, but a different app.
[3:28:21.560 --> 3:28:25.680]  They're just going to use an iPad structure, but the person connected to the security apparatus
[3:28:25.680 --> 3:28:31.400]  of it is also connected to Pete Buttigieg's campaign also has sort of deep state ties.
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:36.560]  Of course, Harry Reid's political machine, despite him being retired, still very influential.
[3:28:36.560 --> 3:28:41.640]  So whatever you say, Iowa was just a small preview of what you're going to see in Nevada
[3:28:41.640 --> 3:28:43.080]  in a couple of weeks.
[3:28:43.080 --> 3:28:47.400]  So up next, Gerald will be taking over for us and we'll take you through for the next

[3:30:45.080 --> 3:30:54.400]  Do not order those products, silence, don't sell it.
[3:30:54.400 --> 3:30:58.640]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers who infowars.
[3:30:58.640 --> 3:31:04.320]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of
[3:31:04.320 --> 3:31:09.040]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide.
[3:31:09.040 --> 3:31:14.640]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty
[3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:16.120]  is amazing as well.
[3:31:16.120 --> 3:31:21.560]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas.
[3:31:21.560 --> 3:31:26.360]  Trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's
[3:31:26.360 --> 3:31:27.720]  been doing an amazing job.
[3:31:27.720 --> 3:31:33.080]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because
[3:31:33.080 --> 3:31:39.560]  we are effective and the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big
[3:31:39.560 --> 3:31:40.560]  way.
[3:31:40.560 --> 3:31:43.760]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let
[3:31:43.760 --> 3:31:48.200]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[3:31:48.200 --> 3:31:52.560]  That's an attempt to demoralize us, we've got to remember that and stay focused and
[3:31:52.560 --> 3:31:53.560]  stay happy.
[3:31:53.560 --> 3:31:56.760]  Well, it's here, the year 2020.
[3:31:56.760 --> 3:31:58.120]  World government's out in the open.
[3:31:58.120 --> 3:32:01.840]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as
[3:32:01.840 --> 3:32:02.840]  the answer.
[3:32:02.840 --> 3:32:08.360]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks
[3:32:08.360 --> 3:32:14.720]  against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the
[3:32:14.720 --> 3:32:16.480]  protection of the unborn.
[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:17.480]  Wow.
[3:32:17.480 --> 3:32:21.520]  But now we know we're right, the new world order's real, Satanism's real, the pedophile
[3:32:21.520 --> 3:32:25.640]  leader real, but we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying
[3:32:25.640 --> 3:32:26.640]  no.
[3:32:26.640 --> 3:32:30.000]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been
[3:32:30.000 --> 3:32:31.000]  in Kansas.
[3:32:31.000 --> 3:32:34.920]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[3:32:34.920 --> 3:32:39.760]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything
[3:32:39.760 --> 3:32:41.520]  we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[3:32:41.520 --> 3:32:42.760]  So it's an incredible town to be alive.
[3:32:42.760 --> 3:32:47.040]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved, but just remember, your
[3:32:47.040 --> 3:32:52.960]  action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support at www.MFBorgstore.com is critical.
[3:32:52.960 --> 3:32:54.840]  So please take action.
[3:32:54.840 --> 3:33:20.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show and now your
[3:33:20.640 --> 3:33:50.160]  host, Gerald Salente.
[3:33:50.640 --> 3:34:20.440]  And you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:34:20.440 --> 3:34:50.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:34:50.240 --> 3:35:20.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:35:20.040 --> 3:35:49.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:35:49.840 --> 3:36:19.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:36:19.640 --> 3:36:49.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:36:49.440 --> 3:37:19.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:37:19.240 --> 3:37:49.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:37:49.040 --> 3:38:18.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:38:18.840 --> 3:38:48.640]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:38:48.640 --> 3:39:18.440]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:39:18.440 --> 3:39:48.240]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:39:48.240 --> 3:40:18.040]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show, you're listening to the Alex Jones show,
[3:40:18.040 --> 3:40:23.260]  so now all these currencies are going down because they're lowering interest rates to
[3:40:23.260 --> 3:40:30.240]  boost their economy, so it costs them more to buy gold, but even with that gold prices
[3:40:30.240 --> 3:40:38.800]  are going up. This is very important to look at. They should be going down now because
[3:40:38.800 --> 3:40:47.960]  of the strong dollar. So I believe that gold right now is in a very critical stage, breaking
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:41:00.080]  over that 1,570 mark. If it solidifies over $1,610 an ounce in the very near future, iForecast
[3:41:00.080 --> 3:41:07.120]  is going to take at least another $100 spike. And if you go back to our trends journal,
[3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:15.240]  the trend alert we sent out last September, September 6 to be exact, the gold bull run
[3:41:15.240 --> 3:41:24.480]  has begun gold was at $1,332 an ounce. As I mentioned, right now it's above $1,570 an
[3:41:24.480 --> 3:41:35.120]  ounce. This is telling you what's going on around the world. And it's a shaky situation.
[3:41:35.120 --> 3:41:39.280]  You're going to start seeing auto sales going, the auto sales have been tanking. They've
[3:41:39.280 --> 3:41:45.760]  been going down all around the world. That's a big indicator before the Corona virus way
[3:41:45.760 --> 3:41:52.120]  before the Corona virus in China, in India, in Europe and in the United States. Sales
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:57.920]  are going down because autos are the second thing you buy after you could afford buying
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:04.440]  a house and your rent. You buy a car. You can't afford it right now. This is a very
[3:42:04.440 --> 3:42:12.360]  important indicator of what's going on and what to watch out for. So we have a global
[3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:20.400]  slowdown. The Corona virus is going to make it much worse. And is what tensions heating
[3:42:20.400 --> 3:42:29.080]  up? Where are they heating up? They're not only heating up more as we see it over in
[3:42:29.080 --> 3:42:38.320]  the Middle East, but also in Venezuela. And not happy about some things that are going
[3:42:38.320 --> 3:42:43.680]  on there. And we're going to talk more about it when we come back because people better
[3:42:43.680 --> 3:42:49.080]  prepare for the worst. If the worst doesn't happen, you didn't lose anything. If you don't
[3:42:49.080 --> 3:42:53.440]  prepare, you could lose everything. We'll be right back.

[3:43:54.800 --> 3:43:59.160]  the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[3:43:59.160 --> 3:44:03.360]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down. Get plenty of hydration.
[3:44:03.360 --> 3:44:06.760]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier. Get plenty of vitamin C. Get
[3:44:06.760 --> 3:44:11.240]  plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil. Take your colloidal silver, all of it. That's
[3:44:11.240 --> 3:44:16.240]  what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep. We have sold out of the 16 ounce
[3:44:16.240 --> 3:44:20.800]  immune gargle that has the nano silver that's patented and documented and even admitted
[3:44:20.800 --> 3:44:24.640]  in documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona SARS family. A virus we're almost
[3:44:24.640 --> 3:44:28.760]  sold out of the one ounce spray bottles. That'll be sold out a couple of days and we're about
[3:44:28.760 --> 3:44:32.760]  a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles. Great to have, period.
[3:44:32.760 --> 3:44:35.600]  Really good for your gums. Really great for your teeth. We also have the super silver
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:39.040]  in our whitening toothpaste. Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or
[3:44:39.040 --> 3:44:42.480]  make our own products with this top nano tech company based here in the U.S. that's in
[3:44:42.480 --> 3:44:46.360]  all these homeland security documents and everything because we get the best stuff. There's a lot
[3:44:46.360 --> 3:44:49.560]  of patriots. There's not just bad guys coming after us. There's a flip side of all the good
[3:44:49.560 --> 3:44:56.000]  guys and good gals. It's very exciting. I want to talk about super silver whitening
[3:44:56.000 --> 3:45:01.280]  toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and I told
[3:45:01.280 --> 3:45:04.560]  Alex. I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried. He's like, well, what are
[3:45:04.560 --> 3:45:08.200]  you doing just sitting in here telling me? You got to get up there and tell people. So
[3:45:08.200 --> 3:45:14.080]  here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've
[3:45:14.080 --> 3:45:18.680]  ever tried. And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's
[3:45:18.680 --> 3:45:23.320]  fluoride free. I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium
[3:45:23.320 --> 3:45:28.280]  because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste that
[3:45:28.280 --> 3:45:33.000]  I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this. It feels so good.
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:38.560]  It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth. In fact, I find myself
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:43.600]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I
[3:45:43.600 --> 3:45:54.640]  like the way it feels.
[3:45:54.640 --> 3:45:59.120]  Almost all the other big storeable food companies are sold out of food. But I know for a fact
[3:45:59.120 --> 3:46:03.880]  from sources to tell them people, oh, we've got it. Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[3:46:03.880 --> 3:46:07.520]  We follow this pattern over and over again. I've been already for 25 years. I've had
[3:46:07.520 --> 3:46:11.640]  storeable food for a long time and I learned very quickly a lot of these companies, they're
[3:46:11.640 --> 3:46:16.160]  fine during normal times, but during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because
[3:46:16.160 --> 3:46:20.040]  of inventory. They'll still take your orders. That's why about 11 years ago, I found my
[3:46:20.040 --> 3:46:24.240]  Patriot supply now the biggest most trusted company out there and I became a private
[3:46:24.240 --> 3:46:27.680]  label or forum because they actually have it on hand. They actually give it delivered
[3:46:27.680 --> 3:46:30.600]  to you on time. They do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want
[3:46:30.600 --> 3:46:33.920]  you as a customer over and over again and they're good people. Now they were saying
[3:46:33.920 --> 3:46:37.280]  seven to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food, but they've got to package it
[3:46:37.280 --> 3:46:43.240]  record level orders. Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[3:46:43.240 --> 3:46:47.360]  So get your orders at an infowarstore.com. Get the best deals. Get it delivered first.
[3:46:47.360 --> 3:46:51.240]  They're in our system. It goes right to them. Then it funds the info as well. So get prepared
[3:46:51.240 --> 3:46:57.440]  infowarstore.com with storeable foods.
[3:46:57.440 --> 3:47:14.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:14.240 --> 3:47:22.440]  Waging war on corruption. It's Gerald Salente. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:47:22.440 --> 3:47:30.720]  Hello. Hello. Great being on the Alex Jones show. Remember what I was just reading to
[3:47:30.720 --> 3:47:36.600]  you about all this pollution in the water. And again, why it's important for you to consider
[3:47:36.600 --> 3:47:43.080]  getting equipment and what you need to protect yourself and your family from all the poisons
[3:47:43.080 --> 3:47:47.800]  that they're pumping into our system. And of course, info wars has a lot of those products
[3:47:47.800 --> 3:47:54.480]  that can help you survive. I was talking, first of all, about the slowdown in the global
[3:47:54.480 --> 3:48:05.200]  economy. And again, this precedes what's going on with coronavirus. The last quarter
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:14.720]  of 2019, you know, the growth in Europe was 0.1 percent. Like how about no growth at all?
[3:48:14.720 --> 3:48:20.560]  So now the news, Mnuchin and Lagarde. Mnuchin, of course, is our U.S. Secretary. And Lagarde
[3:48:20.560 --> 3:48:25.000]  is the head of the European Central Bank. He used to be the head of the International
[3:48:25.000 --> 3:48:31.800]  Mafia, excuse me, Monetary Fund. And now they moved her to another criminal group
[3:48:31.800 --> 3:48:37.680]  over there. The U.S. Secretary of State, Stephen Mnuchin, warned the U.S. economy would probably
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:42.640]  not reach 3 percent growth rate this year, predicted by the Trump administration, citing
[3:48:42.640 --> 3:48:51.240]  Boeing 737 Max Wows and coronavirus outbreak. It's BS. There's nothing to do with Boeing.
[3:48:51.240 --> 3:48:57.240]  Nothing to do with coronavirus. It's a global slowdown. We only saw 2.3 percent growth last
[3:48:57.240 --> 3:49:04.800]  year and had nothing to do with coronavirus. So I want to pick up just a little bit where
[3:49:04.800 --> 3:49:10.960]  Mr. Bonds was speaking before I got on. And he did a wonderful job there in showing the
[3:49:10.960 --> 3:49:17.200]  criminal democraps, both parties to me, repulsive kins and democraps, how they're rigging the
[3:49:17.200 --> 3:49:24.040]  election trying to bring down Sanders and put in that CIA boy, Buttigieg or whatever
[3:49:24.040 --> 3:49:33.120]  his name is, Buddha this, Buddha that, you know, who knows. But, but, but, but. I like
[3:49:33.120 --> 3:49:41.160]  reading the news after this stuff comes out after the election in Iowa. And it's very
[3:49:41.160 --> 3:49:46.360]  important too because Iowa used to be a big thing, you know, the Iowa vote. Oh, no, who's
[3:49:46.360 --> 3:49:52.880]  ever going to win that one's going to be next. How Iowa got away from Biden. Big story here
[3:49:52.880 --> 3:50:03.360]  in the Wall Street Journal. How Iowa got away from Biden. How could any, how could anything
[3:50:03.360 --> 3:50:09.560]  stay with Biden? The guys are crazy, stupid loser, an arrogant boy who's been sucking
[3:50:09.560 --> 3:50:18.160]  off the public, you know what, his entire life. Never worked a day in his life. Arrogant.
[3:50:18.160 --> 3:50:25.160]  Oh, and he gave his boy Hunter Thompson, all those Hunter Thompson, excuse me, Mr. Thompson,
[3:50:25.160 --> 3:50:32.480]  for being disrespectful. Hunter Biden. You know, he got that gig in Ukraine. Can't speak
[3:50:32.480 --> 3:50:39.440]  a word of the lingo. Doesn't know anything about the energy business, but he got what,
[3:50:39.440 --> 3:50:45.840]  $50,000 a month to sit on the board of directors of barista energy. So anyway, how did Biden
[3:50:45.840 --> 3:50:55.320]  lose? Then again, another one, Bloomberg boost spending and staffing. B.S. Bloomberg has
[3:50:55.320 --> 3:51:06.520]  spent almost $300 million already. So when people talk about the great democracy of
[3:51:06.520 --> 3:51:14.840]  America's saving, you got to be in it to win it. And to be in it, you got to have a lot
[3:51:14.840 --> 3:51:22.080]  of dough these days. All you got to be a shill, like butter gig was being propped up the deep
[3:51:22.080 --> 3:51:31.360]  state boy. You arrive on a run. We go nowhere. And that other guy, that other Democratic
[3:51:31.360 --> 3:51:38.800]  guy, he was cyber, Steve, whatever his name is, another multi, multi, millionaire, billionaire
[3:51:38.800 --> 3:51:48.720]  guy. So the whole game is rigged. And then this one over here, not a funny story to me.
[3:51:48.720 --> 3:51:54.240]  Shaken by Trump's acquittal, Democrats ask, what do we do next? What do you mean, what
[3:51:54.240 --> 3:52:06.360]  do you do next? It's a freak show. Bunch of disgusting human beings running. Bernie Sanders,
[3:52:06.360 --> 3:52:11.320]  New Face Bernie, another guy that never worked a day in his life either, playing Mr. Important,
[3:52:11.320 --> 3:52:16.680]  flip flopping back and forth when, you know, it appeals to him to do it, you know, to get
[3:52:16.680 --> 3:52:26.080]  the votes. This guy supported, you know, I voted against the Iraq war. Yeah, you voted
[3:52:26.080 --> 3:52:32.160]  against the Iraq war. You voted when you were a congressman to support murderous Bill Clinton
[3:52:32.160 --> 3:52:41.520]  sanctions on Iraq that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five. And
[3:52:41.520 --> 3:52:48.160]  you remember, remember, Madeleine, not all that bright. Yeah. How were you when ambassador
[3:52:48.160 --> 3:52:54.120]  to the United Nations telling Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes, if the price of the death of
[3:52:54.120 --> 3:53:00.800]  500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five was worth the sanctions? And she said, yes,
[3:53:00.800 --> 3:53:09.720]  it was. The funny story was only I did a gig on the QE to back in 2002. And I was a second
[3:53:09.720 --> 3:53:17.760]  day keynote speaker. She was the first. What a trip. 15 minute introduction with her. 15
[3:53:17.760 --> 3:53:25.600]  minutes. It went on and on. She looked like the queen of thoughts all dressed up in red.
[3:53:25.600 --> 3:53:30.920]  Next day they introduced me, Mr. Slenty, you know, author of Trends, Trend Tracking,
[3:53:30.920 --> 3:53:35.840]  Far Better Than Megatrends, Trends 2000, International Bestselling Book, publisher of the Trends Journal
[3:53:35.840 --> 3:53:41.520]  magazine, world leader in trend forecasting, blah, blah, blah. So the guy after, you know,
[3:53:41.520 --> 3:53:46.360]  remember, these are all top marketing executives from around the world. It was a cruise going
[3:53:46.360 --> 3:53:53.360]  on and the QE to and on the second next day, the keynote speaker. And I said, thank you
[3:53:53.360 --> 3:54:01.760]  very much for that introduction. I said, however, after hearing Miss Albright's introduction,
[3:54:01.760 --> 3:54:07.440]  I said, I feel like I was shortchanged and the crowd broke up laughing. And I said, because
[3:54:07.440 --> 3:54:11.480]  they went on Madeline Albright grew up in Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic, she
[3:54:11.480 --> 3:54:14.640]  had honors in this, her father did that, her mother did this, she went to this school,
[3:54:14.640 --> 3:54:18.480]  that school, honors in this, honors in that, honors in this, honors in that. I said, what
[3:54:18.480 --> 3:54:26.080]  you also fail to mention is that I went to PS 76 and graduated without honors, you know,
[3:54:26.080 --> 3:54:30.960]  so I brought down the house. But anyway, Madeline Albright, not all that bright, Bernie Sanders,
[3:54:30.960 --> 3:54:36.040]  just BS Bernie will say what he needs to say to do what he wants to do to get elected.
[3:54:36.040 --> 3:54:40.480]  Anybody that would waste their life spending all this time running for campaign to me is
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:49.000]  out of their minds. They're crazy. They want power. They want to run. Eisenhower said
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:56.600]  it five star general, supreme commander, the allied forces, two term president who also
[3:54:56.600 --> 3:55:01.800]  warned us about the military industrial complex robbing us of the genius of the scientists
[3:55:01.800 --> 3:55:06.720]  sweater, the laborers and the future of the children, which he was 100% right on because
[3:55:06.720 --> 3:55:12.480]  the military industrial complex is taken over. He has a quote basically to the words anyone
[3:55:12.480 --> 3:55:19.480]  running for office, anyone that seeks the office of presidents presidency is either
[3:55:19.480 --> 3:55:28.600]  an ego maniac or crazy. Yeah, you got it. Anyway, I want to finish up and talking about what
[3:55:28.600 --> 3:55:35.600]  upset me very much last week. And that was President Trump's state of the union address.
[3:55:35.600 --> 3:55:45.800]  And he brought in that little boy that deep state shill one guido into the house of representatives.
[3:55:45.800 --> 3:55:49.520]  He should have never brought him in there. It was a disgrace to me as an American and
[3:55:49.520 --> 3:55:56.880]  you know the motto of my magazine, the trends journal. Think for yourself to have this guy
[3:55:56.880 --> 3:56:04.280]  in there is guido boy, the deep state guy that they want to put in there to overthrow
[3:56:04.280 --> 3:56:11.640]  the Maduro government. Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the
[3:56:11.640 --> 3:56:19.000]  hope streams and aspirations of all Venezuelans. Joining us in this gallery is the true and
[3:56:19.000 --> 3:56:25.480]  legitimate president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido. Mr. President, please take this message back
[3:56:25.480 --> 3:56:31.960]  to your homeland. Please take this message back to America that all Americans are united
[3:56:31.960 --> 3:56:40.160]  with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom. I am not behind Juan
[3:56:40.160 --> 3:56:50.760]  Guaido. I'm not behind Maduro. I am an American. No foreign entanglement. You think we care
[3:56:50.760 --> 3:56:57.280]  about Venezuela if their major export was broccoli and they weren't we're in sitting
[3:56:57.280 --> 3:57:03.760]  on the world's largest oil reserves. Just like we're in the Middle East for that. So
[3:57:03.760 --> 3:57:12.920]  I totally, totally am opposed to this and all those demo craps and repulsive kids all
[3:57:12.920 --> 3:57:21.760]  start up. Yeah, yeah, and sheared them away. And then we just heard from little Chuckie
[3:57:21.760 --> 3:57:32.080]  Schumer saying that Trump should be doing more to overthrow the government. So thanks
[3:57:32.080 --> 3:57:38.480]  for tuning in. Remember peace on earth. That's all I want. Liberty, love, joy and beauty
[3:57:38.480 --> 3:57:53.720]  and do what you can to support info wars. Trends journal dot com.
