[09:15.820 --> 09:20.620]  predicted that they would go ahead and turbo launch them this week we have that

[10:23.800 --> 10:27.500]  global government program see we've been under global government for a long
[10:27.500 --> 10:32.500]  time a corporate global government where countries don't get IMF World Bank
[10:32.500 --> 10:37.060]  loans countries don't get global corporations to even come and agree to
[10:37.060 --> 10:42.260]  build a dam or agree to even allow them to be operating I mean if you don't want

[11:09.140 --> 11:14.420]  of that of course as they celebrated 50 years the European Union in 2007 and even
[11:14.420 --> 11:17.580]  people in Europe said I thought it started in 2000 how is it a 50 year
[11:17.580 --> 11:21.860]  anniversary because the Treaty of Rome established the corporate governance of
[11:21.860 --> 11:28.380]  Europe as a receivership to NM Rothschild and her majesty Saxe-Coburg
[11:28.380 --> 11:34.180]  Gotha of the UK and allied crime syndicate holdings of the Commonwealth as
[11:34.180 --> 11:40.700]  well as the Dutch holdings and then allied with the United States and
[11:40.700 --> 11:45.900]  Rockefeller holdings I mean it's all on record and they're you Genesis and you
[11:45.900 --> 11:49.460]  got fluoride in your water to give you bone cancer and lower IQ because they
[11:49.460 --> 11:56.260]  said so and that's the way it is and narcotics are shipped into your country
[11:56.260 --> 11:59.620]  because that's the way it is because they said so you're gonna be in their
[11:59.620 --> 12:06.140]  little private prison working for 25 cents an hour because they said so you're
[12:06.140 --> 12:12.060]  gonna displace everybody's jobs and the trader government is going to pay to
[12:12.060 --> 12:17.220]  have your factory ship to China and Brazil and Eastern Europe and the
[12:17.220 --> 12:20.940]  federal government's gonna pay to have taxes raised on companies that stay in
[12:20.940 --> 12:25.900]  the US to incentivize them leaving the United States and all the billionaires
[12:25.900 --> 12:30.780]  on record will pay only a few percentage points in taxes they will pay
[12:30.780 --> 12:35.820]  almost no taxes but you a blue-collar worker are gonna have the book thrown at
[12:35.820 --> 12:44.340]  you because the name of the game the goal is to destroy you and your family
[12:44.340 --> 12:51.660]  and they control both political parties they control the leadership of the both
[12:51.660 --> 12:55.180]  traitorous groups and it's the same thing with the parliamentary system where
[12:55.180 --> 13:00.860]  you've got three or four major parties in Europe this is what they're doing now
[13:00.860 --> 13:07.900]  I'm gonna stop right there and I am gonna attempt to just read you each of the
[13:07.900 --> 13:11.020]  headlines and then go back into it you know I always fail I always go two or
[13:11.020 --> 13:16.740]  three articles in and and stop and just bore into that article but things are
[13:16.740 --> 13:21.300]  getting wilder and crazier by the minute things are getting very very clear
[13:21.300 --> 13:26.180]  things are getting to the point where the globalists don't even hide what
[13:26.180 --> 13:38.340]  they're doing anymore here is the article at info wars com with the audio and the
[13:38.340 --> 13:45.660]  video limbaugh Ron Paul sounds like an Islamic terrorist says he would have no
[13:45.660 --> 13:51.020]  problem with TSA detaining US congressman now you notice all the new TSA ads
[13:51.020 --> 13:53.860]  three-year and we told you this was coming as we got internal documents from
[13:53.860 --> 13:58.860]  good people inside the federal government that they sold the tyranny in
[13:58.860 --> 14:01.780]  the name of fighting quote Muslim extremists which they knew was popular
[14:01.780 --> 14:07.340]  in their in their focus group test but behind the scenes none of it was to do
[14:07.340 --> 14:12.340]  with Islamic terrorists all of it was about gun owners libertarians
[14:12.340 --> 14:18.740]  conservatives now you see the rollout of the white al-Qaeda you see the TV ads the
[14:18.740 --> 14:27.820]  PSAs the video PSAs where everyone in these ads on TV is a white white
[14:27.820 --> 14:33.180]  collar executive type male female and everyone reporting them as a quote
[14:33.180 --> 14:37.620]  minority so now they're going to sell the quote minorities or really the
[14:37.620 --> 14:42.220]  majority in most areas of the United States that no no no no no you're tired
[14:42.220 --> 14:45.820]  of being pointed out as the terrorist because you got brown skin now it's the
[14:45.820 --> 14:50.260]  white person they're the terrorist so they're they're selling it in a
[14:50.260 --> 14:55.780]  Balkanized way and rolling out and saying on the news the militias work
[14:55.780 --> 14:59.740]  with al-Qaeda and are getting ready for new Oklahoma cities now does anybody
[14:59.740 --> 15:04.220]  believe that the militia type I mean when 9-11 happened most the militias
[15:04.220 --> 15:08.140]  stopped being afraid of the federal government embraced the police state and
[15:08.140 --> 15:14.180]  and and and basically stuck you know al-Qaeda hunting licensed and you know
[15:14.180 --> 15:18.940]  al-Qaeda seasons open hunting licenses on the back of their cars I mean I'm sure
[15:18.940 --> 15:23.060]  you all saw those American flags everywhere these are good patriotic
[15:23.060 --> 15:29.020]  people who bought in the propaganda the idea that good old boys in Michigan or
[15:29.020 --> 15:37.060]  Texas or Indiana or Florida or Tennessee or California would get anywhere near
[15:37.060 --> 15:41.260]  al-Qaeda which itself is a manufactured front group on record by the big global
[15:41.260 --> 15:46.220]  banks that as a way to men assess and taking away our liberties anyone who
[15:46.220 --> 15:52.740]  believes that is certifiably stupid but the system doesn't care and so now
[15:52.740 --> 15:57.260]  here's the rollout so you've got congressmen you've got senators and
[15:57.260 --> 16:03.940]  Limbaugh is saying I side with the TSA now of course he sided with them right
[16:03.940 --> 16:07.220]  at the same time the White House was siding with them now here's the hill
[16:07.220 --> 16:12.060]  newspaper White House sides with TSA in Rand Paul standoff says they don't know
[16:12.060 --> 16:16.180]  anything about a police state in America that's a quote and that's the White
[16:16.180 --> 16:21.060]  House spokesman Carney Jay Carney he knows nothing about a police state no just
[16:21.060 --> 16:27.980]  major universities list us now is number six globally and goes on to say
[16:27.980 --> 16:38.660]  they're keeping us safe and that Rand Paul is wrong but but but Limbaugh Limbaugh goes even further and he
[16:38.660 --> 16:45.100]  says to everyone involved we've got the clip here we're gonna plan a moment that
[16:45.100 --> 16:49.660]  this is basically what they deserve not only is it good to want to grow up
[16:49.660 --> 16:57.540]  people's genitals not only are microwave oven scanners good but he goes one
[16:57.540 --> 17:02.260]  further that these people are like terrorist and that's how it works see
[17:02.260 --> 17:05.220]  you know of Rand Paul's for real or Ron Paul's for real look at their voting
[17:05.220 --> 17:11.900]  records and look at how the left and the right establishment acts like they are
[17:11.900 --> 17:19.300]  devils and they do this because the establishment is scared to death now I
[17:19.300 --> 17:25.340]  have flown just five or six times on expensive private jets because over the
[17:25.340 --> 17:29.420]  years I've had people say I'm sitting a jet to pick you up I want to talk to you
[17:29.420 --> 17:34.180]  famous Hollywood folks you know people like that they don't fly commercially
[17:34.180 --> 17:38.220]  people that are making 20 million 30 million 50 million dollars a year they
[17:38.220 --> 17:42.660]  don't and and so it's like sending sending a car for you you know when I'm
[17:42.660 --> 17:45.820]  on national TV or something sometimes you know they send a car it's like a black
[17:45.820 --> 17:49.420]  taxi to pick me up well for rich people truly rich people it's like sending a
[17:49.420 --> 17:56.220]  car and so a Gulfstream jet we're not even Gulfstream even bigger than that
[17:56.220 --> 18:01.380]  all just giant wide-body jet lands and picks you up and one time I was being
[18:01.380 --> 18:06.660]  flown by guys that fly Rush Limbaugh and we and we there are all your talk shows
[18:06.660 --> 18:10.180]  yeah we fly Limbaugh sometimes he's got this type of jet it's really nice you
[18:10.180 --> 18:15.260]  know it's it's about a 40 million dollar it's about as nice as these as these
[18:15.260 --> 18:19.420]  type of jets get you know get it's the same type as this one that I was flying
[18:19.420 --> 18:23.860]  on they were flying me out to California and I'm the only guy you know on a jet
[18:23.860 --> 18:29.060]  with you know just you know for like 30 people could be on it's ridiculous and
[18:29.060 --> 18:34.300]  so when I got home of four or five days later I typed in to the search engine
[18:34.300 --> 18:38.300]  about his jet and surely enough there were a couple jets he owns because he
[18:38.300 --> 18:42.060]  makes hundreds of millions of dollars every four or five years and so I
[18:42.060 --> 18:48.300]  understand for him see I'm scum Obama sees as a scum Limbaugh all these
[18:48.300 --> 18:52.500]  elitists see us to scum and and they and and they just go a little private
[18:52.500 --> 18:57.900]  airport don't get checked in I just walked right on the tarmac and there's
[18:57.900 --> 19:03.860]  pilots and a person serving me caviar whatever I want and the jet takes off
[19:03.860 --> 19:06.860]  but see I don't live like that I don't have the money for that if I had the
[19:06.860 --> 19:10.700]  money for that I wouldn't live like that but these elitist most of them live in
[19:10.700 --> 19:15.980]  off banker bailout money and stuff they're all flying around like Bain
[19:15.980 --> 19:19.860]  Capitol that owns you know what like a rush Limbaugh is on that's gotten you
[19:19.860 --> 19:22.620]  know that's been connected to Goldman Sachs and others that have gotten taxpayer
[19:22.620 --> 19:26.980]  money they're all flying around in their big taxpayer you know funded jets up
[19:26.980 --> 19:33.020]  there in the sky and then little old Alex Jones you know I can't fly now I
[19:33.020 --> 19:36.780]  can't go anywhere because I won't let a potbellied person you know molest my
[19:36.780 --> 19:42.660]  children my wife and see little old Rand Paul he's flying commercial he's a
[19:42.660 --> 19:46.300]  low-level scum you know US senator according to Limbaugh and so he's

[24:07.820 --> 24:13.700]  okay I'm gonna plunge into the off-the-charts news coming up George
[24:13.700 --> 24:18.340]  Soros warns of violent riots in America financial collapse government clampdown
[24:18.340 --> 24:24.300]  martial law that's what's going on at Davos right now that's what they're
[24:24.300 --> 24:28.940]  discussing and acting like they never saw it coming even though they've had the
[24:28.940 --> 24:34.540]  military and police worldwide joint training and gearing up for it for at
[24:34.540 --> 24:38.380]  least two decades but the minute they got rid of Glass-Steagall where they
[24:38.380 --> 24:44.300]  could create unlimited Ponzi fraud paper in the late 90s they began in earnest
[24:44.300 --> 24:49.100]  getting ready for the designed implosion on the way up the Bankster
[24:49.100 --> 24:55.900]  fraudster anti-free market trillion controller class they're more than
[24:55.900 --> 24:59.900]  billionaires they're trillionaire controllers they control trillions
[24:59.900 --> 25:09.260]  began the preparation for total implosion of the economy now I get so mad
[25:09.260 --> 25:14.140]  when I hear a audio clip like this because it just shows the tyranny
[25:14.140 --> 25:20.580]  manifesting that I have trouble speaking I got so angry in the New York
[25:20.580 --> 25:29.780]  Times within 30 minutes of Rand Paul not being detained coming out and saying he
[25:29.780 --> 25:35.980]  was never detained Senator Rand Paul there in Tennessee at the airport that I
[25:35.980 --> 25:40.540]  called some folks I know that are high up in his office I'll just leave it at
[25:40.540 --> 25:45.460]  that and gotten off the record that no he's he's just been released he was
[25:45.460 --> 25:53.020]  there about two hours he's getting on a plane to DC I knew this before his wife
[25:53.020 --> 25:56.780]  did because then I called the individual back and said yeah I just talked to his
[25:56.780 --> 26:00.500]  wife everything's you know you know now she knows what's going on the point is
[26:00.500 --> 26:08.020]  is that I knew what was going on from inside while it was happening and then
[26:08.020 --> 26:12.700]  separately here's the New York Times within 30 minutes of Kurt Nemo writing
[26:12.700 --> 26:21.220]  his article yesterday Kurt Nemo just happened to be looking at emails he was
[26:21.220 --> 26:24.580]  getting and somebody said hey Kurt look at this new Twitter that was just put out
[26:24.580 --> 26:29.620]  by Ron Paul within minutes Kurt was writing a blurb and within 15 minutes of
[26:29.620 --> 26:34.780]  Kurt Nemo writing an info wars.com article then it was CBS New York Times
[26:34.780 --> 26:44.220]  and all the rest of them but the point is New York Times when no one knew what
[26:44.220 --> 26:48.420]  had happened to Rand Paul nothing had been confirmed yet except for his phone
[26:48.420 --> 26:55.900]  call to his dad Ron Paul who then put the Twitter out that he'd been detained
[26:55.900 --> 27:00.780]  no one else had talked to Rand Paul not his wife no one as soon as he talked to
[27:00.780 --> 27:04.420]  his office I called my source and they said here's the deal they're letting him
[27:04.420 --> 27:11.140]  get on another plane he just got on and he's going to DC it had just come out and
[27:11.140 --> 27:16.540]  the New York Times came out with a lie and said he was not detained and others
[27:16.540 --> 27:25.020]  did now it turns out for two hours they held him and would scream at him and
[27:25.020 --> 27:30.020]  tell him he ended up he'd been there about 30 minutes when he called Ron
[27:30.020 --> 27:33.580]  Paul they came into the cubicle and I've got his quotes here in the daily
[27:33.580 --> 27:40.580]  caller and screamed at him and said now you're gonna be held longer you're not
[27:40.580 --> 27:45.420]  supposed to make a cell phone call how do you have that cell phone or we wouldn't
[27:45.420 --> 27:51.340]  even have known that so my point is this is the level of deception that we deal
[27:51.340 --> 27:55.180]  with as a society is oh he wasn't detained oh we're not groping your
[27:55.180 --> 27:58.380]  children oh we're not going in their pants oh there's no radiation oh we're
[27:58.380 --> 28:01.820]  not strip searching old ladies and it always comes out that they're lying
[28:01.820 --> 28:09.260]  it's a policy of lying to us and now the media is calling Rand Paul a liar when
[28:09.260 --> 28:13.060]  everybody knows they detained people and by the way you're under arrest when the
[28:13.060 --> 28:19.140]  police car lights go on when they tell you go over here when they're putting
[28:19.140 --> 28:23.580]  their hands on you that's a custodial arrest under common law so he wasn't
[28:23.580 --> 28:29.820]  just detained he was under arrest it's worse than the word he even used and in
[28:29.820 --> 28:34.740]  America Ron Paul has been on this show it talks about him groping his genitals
[28:34.740 --> 28:42.940]  and going in people's pants and what did the media at that time do they came out
[28:42.940 --> 28:46.860]  and said Ron Paul's lying they don't go in the pants until all these videos came
[28:46.860 --> 28:51.060]  out showing it happening and they said well we don't call that going in the
[28:51.060 --> 28:55.340]  pants even though we do go in your pants remember a few months ago they said
[28:55.340 --> 28:59.820]  these old ladies 90 years old 85 in one case they're lying we don't take them in
[28:59.820 --> 29:03.220]  a back room and strip search him and then it came out that indeed they were
[29:03.220 --> 29:07.380]  and they apologized last week but they're still doing it they always say
[29:07.380 --> 29:14.180]  we're gonna stop and they don't stop it's just a psychological warfare program
[29:14.180 --> 29:19.060]  we're gonna go to break and come back with a limbaugh clip but imagine I want
[29:19.060 --> 29:25.220]  to fly I want to go places but I cannot have hot belly pedophile stick their
[29:25.220 --> 29:30.220]  hands down my daughter's pants I mean they take baby's diapers off they beat
[29:30.220 --> 29:35.180]  people up people died in their custody I can't be part of it and then limbaugh
[29:35.180 --> 29:39.580]  just says you know what we're all Al Qaeda he comes out and says we're gonna
[29:39.580 --> 29:45.900]  play the clip here that he's an Islamist terrorist function and it's not a
[29:45.900 --> 29:51.500]  joke they're gonna start arresting people like us we're on the march the

[33:31.700 --> 33:36.420]  it's not courage but but but just getting back to this I went and looked up the

[33:41.740 --> 33:47.140]  that people in Hollywood and again I never really sought out Hollywood but
[33:47.140 --> 33:50.860]  over the years famous folks have invited me out there flown me out there
[33:50.860 --> 33:58.500]  come and pick me up before and I've seen how these people live and you know
[33:58.500 --> 34:03.220]  somebody comes and picks you up in a 20 million 30 million 40 million dollar
[34:03.220 --> 34:10.820]  aircraft g4s g5s wide-body I mean you could put 40 passengers on them and it's
[34:10.820 --> 34:22.140]  all you know the finest of everything and that's how Rush Limbaugh lives I flew
[34:22.140 --> 34:24.940]  with some guys like oh yeah you're a talk show host and one of the pilots had
[34:24.940 --> 34:28.340]  heard the show a few times yeah I've seen you on YouTube yeah yeah a few years
[34:28.340 --> 34:32.460]  ago you know we've flown Limbaugh before he's a nice guy blah blah blah yeah we
[34:32.460 --> 34:35.820]  fly him down to the Caribbean blah oh yeah Limbaugh is famous for his trips to
[34:35.820 --> 34:40.900]  the Caribbean by himself and but they didn't get into any of that and it just
[34:40.900 --> 34:44.700]  made me think about it later so I went and searched it and found out about the
[34:44.700 --> 34:50.100]  aircraft you don't 20 million dollar 40 million dollar aircraft and just
[34:50.100 --> 34:54.620]  keeping pilots on standby to fly the aircraft so I understand why Limbaugh
[34:54.620 --> 34:59.460]  thinks it's all funny just like Obama does and just like Nancy Pelosi does and
[34:59.460 --> 35:07.660]  just like that former head of Bain Capital Limbaugh's former boss and owner
[35:07.660 --> 35:13.580]  Mitt Romney Mr. abortion Mr. open borders Mr. Obamacare that were told is so
[35:13.580 --> 35:20.620]  great to vote for I understand because they're all flying around above us you
[35:20.620 --> 35:24.300]  know how you fly you go over here to Austin Berkshire airport where I live
[35:24.300 --> 35:29.500]  you pull up you walk in there's no security somebody walks over and asks you
[35:29.500 --> 35:34.860]  want to drink or coffee and when you get on board you sign your name with the
[35:34.860 --> 35:39.740]  pilots on a register sometimes I haven't even done that and then you just take
[35:39.740 --> 35:45.380]  off into the wall blue yonder and by the way when you pull up at these private
[35:45.380 --> 35:50.980]  aviation facilities there's people in them all over the place I've been in
[35:50.980 --> 35:53.900]  some of these places before when there's 20 or 30 people in there getting ready to
[35:53.900 --> 36:00.020]  get on aircraft and that's how they all fly the people that run America the
[36:00.020 --> 36:03.220]  people that have made the decision you wonder why Congress does this most
[36:03.220 --> 36:06.740]  these Congress people have stolen so much money you'll see the statistics
[36:06.740 --> 36:10.140]  where they go to Congress worth a million dollars and six years later or
[36:10.140 --> 36:17.540]  worth 400 500 million you know why would you spend millions and millions to get
[36:17.540 --> 36:19.940]  elected to a position where you get paid a couple hundred thousand a year
[36:19.940 --> 36:24.180]  because they're in there insider trading they're inside they're in there buying
[36:24.180 --> 36:29.420]  and selling this country getting payoffs you name it and then if you
[36:29.420 --> 36:33.540]  criticize that they're like oh you're anti-free market no it's not free market
[36:33.540 --> 36:39.020]  to have trillions of dollars 27 trillion last time we counted 16 trillion that
[36:39.020 --> 36:44.460]  was secret to the Federal Reserve and counting given to megabanks given to MS
[36:44.460 --> 36:51.860]  NBC given to media divisions and given to subdivisions of Goldman Sachs and
[36:51.860 --> 36:56.100]  others that are connected to them like Bain Capital and others that then goes
[36:56.100 --> 36:59.860]  to talk show host people have always wondered how can Rush Limbaugh get paid
[36:59.860 --> 37:06.580]  more money a year than his show makes because it's the weapons division of
[37:06.580 --> 37:10.260]  the New World Order to keep conservatives in line while he's hanging out
[37:10.260 --> 37:17.700]  partying you know with Elton John which I'm not there judging Elton John but
[37:17.700 --> 37:20.260]  people are like well he's a conservative leader what's he doing spending
[37:20.260 --> 37:23.820]  millions of dollars on a party and hanging out well that's what Rush Limbaugh
[37:23.820 --> 37:30.820]  does he's not that's he's that's who he is these are a bunch of grandiose people
[37:30.820 --> 37:35.100]  who were empty I mean if I was worth hundreds of millions of dollars I'll
[37:35.100 --> 37:39.580]  assure you I wouldn't be spending two million dollars on a party you better
[37:39.580 --> 37:43.720]  believe it'd be going to charities for children the third world by the way is
[37:43.720 --> 37:47.980]  where some of my money does go but I'm not judging them they can do what they
[37:47.980 --> 37:53.060]  want with their money but don't sit there and create a two-class system where
[37:53.060 --> 37:57.460]  I get my genitals grabbed and I get body scanned and my wife gets her breast
[37:57.460 --> 38:02.420]  grabbed and then they literally grab them and my children get trained for
[38:02.420 --> 38:06.460]  sexual assault by a bunch of out-of-control goons that violates my
[38:06.460 --> 38:13.580]  Fourth Amendment my Bill of Rights my Constitution my Republic and you sit
[38:13.580 --> 38:17.340]  around laughing about us how we're unwashed masses and how funny it is that
[38:17.340 --> 38:23.980]  the TSA is doing this by the way senators can get a card and go around TSA of
[38:23.980 --> 38:29.220]  course Rand Paul doesn't even know that because he's not into elitist perks he's
[38:29.220 --> 38:34.060]  a regular guy Ron Paul can go around the screening since other Congress people
[38:34.060 --> 38:38.700]  complained he doesn't do it he goes through it the media then lied and
[38:38.700 --> 38:42.700]  said he uses taxpayer money to fly first-class turned out MSNBC and AP had
[38:42.700 --> 38:47.260]  to retract that wasn't even true he flies so frequently sometimes he gets
[38:47.260 --> 38:52.980]  upgraded they upgrading that's the crimes of Ron Paul when when when flying
[38:52.980 --> 38:56.620]  to and from the district it's paid for by taxpayers and they spend it and say
[38:56.620 --> 39:00.900]  yes first-class meanwhile Ron Paul's being harassed and groped and grabbed
[39:00.900 --> 39:05.460]  on as he said here on this show and limbaugh talks about the Paul family and
[39:05.460 --> 39:11.020]  says they're basically Islamic terrorists they deserve it and my daughters are
[39:11.020 --> 39:15.780]  terrorists or old ladies that are made to walk when they can't and they make
[39:15.780 --> 39:20.380]  passengers help them get up out of their chair and like rip colostomy bags off of
[39:20.380 --> 39:23.780]  them and take them behind closed doors and scream at them and make the old
[39:23.780 --> 39:28.780]  women stripped down 90 year old women going to going home to die of cancer in
[39:28.780 --> 39:33.660]  one of the cases oh yeah one of my soul last year is dead now she was going home
[39:33.660 --> 39:40.780]  to Michigan to die 90 was it 91 years old stage 4 cancer going home to see the
[39:40.780 --> 39:46.140]  family going home to die and they screamed at her she couldn't get out of
[39:46.140 --> 39:50.860]  the wheelchair she had one family member with her a woman couldn't get her out of
[39:50.860 --> 39:54.860]  the chair they screamed and made passengers come over and help that's
[39:54.860 --> 40:00.140]  America and then you get this pill-popping synthetic heroin head who
[40:00.140 --> 40:04.700]  takes synthetic heroin takes so much of it he's got to be put in a coma to go
[40:04.700 --> 40:14.900]  off of it being caught flying in from third-world sex tourism destinations with
[40:14.900 --> 40:19.740]  bottles of viagra he doesn't have prescriptions for I guess that's why a
[40:19.740 --> 40:25.140]  few times he didn't fly on his private jet for whatever reason sitting there
[40:25.140 --> 40:28.860]  lecturing us and I look I don't get nasty about these other talk show hosts
[40:28.860 --> 40:31.860]  you know that I don't spend my time attack other talk shows even though
[40:31.860 --> 40:37.100]  they attack me sometimes but I'm sick of it man I'm tired of this fascism I'm
[40:37.100 --> 40:41.020]  they're now setting up highway checkpoints where they're gonna try to
[40:41.020 --> 40:46.580]  grope my family and enough's enough I would love nothing more than to be able
[40:46.580 --> 40:50.660]  to get up here and commend Rush Limbaugh and commend Glenn Beck you notice I haven't
[40:50.660 --> 40:54.580]  been attacking Glenn Beck as much lately because he's now endorsing Ron Paul
[40:54.580 --> 40:59.580]  he's now when I do spot-checking admitting the stuff's going on and I
[40:59.580 --> 41:02.580]  guess that's why I got thrown out of Fox because he was getting to hardcore and
[41:02.580 --> 41:05.940]  he's going in the right direction so you don't hear me talking about Glenn Beck
[41:05.940 --> 41:10.100]  even though they imitate everything we do I'm glad imitated just don't twist it
[41:10.100 --> 41:16.060]  good and Limbaugh I grew up in high school listening to him and he was a
[41:16.060 --> 41:20.100]  different person and he helped wake me up I don't hate Rush Limbaugh he's a sad
[41:20.100 --> 41:26.380]  person and Rush it's time for you to turn back man and not be such a disgusting
[41:26.380 --> 41:32.060]  new world order servant I mean you don't have to enthusiastically bash Rand Paul
[41:32.060 --> 41:35.660]  I understand you're a sellout you got to have your hundreds of millions in your
[41:35.660 --> 41:39.420]  trophy wives and you're in a prison and you know when I look at you on TV you
[41:39.420 --> 41:45.380]  look like you're in hell I mean we all punish ourselves for what we are but
[41:45.380 --> 41:49.820]  you'd be a lot happier if you and I'm sure you're blackmailed I mean who knows
[41:49.820 --> 41:58.300]  the point is is that it is time for you guys to stop being so happy about
[41:58.300 --> 42:03.540]  stabbing America in the back I mean I know your mercenaries I got all that but
[42:03.540 --> 42:07.540]  I mean just don't have so much fun sledding America's throat while you
[42:07.540 --> 42:12.500]  dance around posing as conservatives by the way we are number one in Orlando
[42:12.500 --> 42:16.940]  and other cities against Limbaugh anywhere they put me on even a moderate
[42:16.940 --> 42:20.620]  station I will destroy all these people you talk about free market you have to
[42:20.620 --> 42:26.180]  have a monopoly cartel to be number one in this country I'm down here with a
[42:26.180 --> 42:32.180]  with a a a plastic baseball bat knocking home runs when you've got a big
[42:32.180 --> 42:35.580]  Louisville slugger I've got a baseball bat you shouldn't be able to hit a ball
[42:35.580 --> 42:39.380]  five feet and I'm knocking it out of the park pal and you know it so don't give
[42:39.380 --> 42:43.180]  me all this free market stuff and survival of the fittest everybody knows
[42:43.180 --> 42:49.060]  this shows a trillion times more hardcore and I don't even want to dominate
[42:49.060 --> 42:53.780]  all these people but it's pathetic to see these propped up facades by the New
[42:53.780 --> 42:57.780]  World Order they're to co-op conservatives there's articles out
[42:57.780 --> 43:01.820]  today about Mitt Romney has to have paid crowds of people with signs of course he
[43:01.820 --> 43:06.460]  does Newt Gennrich can't even get a crowd it's being reported because it's
[43:06.460 --> 43:10.660]  all fake you really think he won by those percentage points in South Carolina we
[43:10.660 --> 43:15.180]  told you that's where you see the fraud a month ago confirm fraud in Iowa
[43:15.180 --> 43:22.740]  Florida is going to be confirmed fraud and again I've spent 43 minutes running
[43:22.740 --> 43:26.860]  about just this issue because here's Rush Limbaugh agreeing with the White
[43:26.860 --> 43:32.380]  House White House says Rand Paul's bad the media runs a hoax saying he wasn't
[43:32.380 --> 43:38.900]  detained he was arrested folks that's what it is it's a rest when you're told
[43:38.900 --> 43:45.700]  you can't leave this area that's a custodial arrest that's the law and when
[43:45.700 --> 43:54.580]  they start groping your children it's sexual assault and here's Rand Paul it's
[43:54.580 --> 44:01.540]  against federal law to detain him except for murder or treason read article
[44:01.540 --> 44:08.140]  one section six of the law the big law he's there two hours Mrs. votes in the
[44:08.140 --> 44:13.180]  Senate it's on record and what is the New York Times do they take the word of
[44:13.180 --> 44:19.580]  confirmed liars the TSA while he hasn't even gotten on his airplane yet after
[44:19.580 --> 44:24.380]  two hours are being held up and say it isn't true from a group that lies about
[44:24.380 --> 44:32.460]  everything under the Sun and what is limbaugh do article at info wars calm
[44:32.460 --> 44:36.380]  limbaugh Ron Paul sounds like an Islamic terrorist says he would have no
[44:36.380 --> 44:43.060]  problem with TSA detaining US congressman and this is from a guy who's got 20
[44:43.060 --> 44:48.020]  and 40 million dollar aircraft and flies around eating caviar above all of us
[44:48.020 --> 44:53.340]  financed by Mitt Romney's company who the other head of it just went to work to
[44:53.340 --> 44:59.180]  replace mobster daily and the Obama administration one big nasty disgusting
[44:59.180 --> 45:08.620]  family fat on our banker bailout money on your taxes and all the incentives to
[45:08.620 --> 45:13.540]  deindustrialize this country lecturing us about free market all day and now
[45:13.540 --> 45:18.420]  implying that Rand Paul is a terrorist let's go ahead and play the clip here it
[45:18.420 --> 45:24.660]  is the video club and audio club here it is folks
[45:25.660 --> 45:33.980]  Rand Paul has been detained by the TSA at the Nashville Airport he set off the
[45:33.980 --> 45:39.500]  alarms and refused to pass down so they detained him he said his dad had known
[45:39.500 --> 45:47.340]  about it and it's become a big story out there now if this had been Ron Paul you
[45:47.340 --> 45:51.260]  couldn't really blame the TSA you have to admit Ron Paul almost sounds like an
[45:51.260 --> 45:59.460]  Islamic terrorist sometime but this wasn't this was Rand Paul anyway folks
[45:59.460 --> 46:06.500]  the Republican establishment is in a full-blown panic that's enough and again
[46:06.500 --> 46:12.140]  I don't even I don't even like attacking limbaugh it's just so pathetic yeah to be
[46:12.140 --> 46:16.100]  clear from the clip and he's saying Ron Paul's the terrorist the point is they're
[46:16.100 --> 46:20.540]  implying that people are terrorists let's have the NDAA let's secret arrest
[46:20.540 --> 46:25.420]  people let's do all of this and then if you go to the urban warfare drills or
[46:25.420 --> 46:30.900]  you get press passes like I did last year sent Rob due to Illinois it was US
[46:30.900 --> 46:36.940]  troops training to put American dissenters in camps on video and I've
[46:36.940 --> 46:48.180]  been to so many of these myself here it is out of KFI radio AM 640 and it says
[46:48.180 --> 46:55.700]  LA military exercises and it says the LAPD with the military will be running
[46:55.700 --> 47:01.140]  drills in different parts of the cities that will involve helicopters and it
[47:01.140 --> 47:06.060]  goes on from there and it's all the condition the military and the public
[47:06.060 --> 47:11.260]  for domestic operations I told you this 14 15 years ago now they admit that's
[47:11.260 --> 47:18.180]  what it's for that's the type of news reports I have all over the country
[47:18.180 --> 47:25.100]  they're putting in cameras that yell orders that you know and that spotlight
[47:25.100 --> 47:29.940]  you from hundreds of yards away with powerful spotlights and begin barking
[47:29.940 --> 47:35.660]  orders at you with bull horns I've got that coming up after a Pulitzer prize
[47:35.660 --> 47:44.340]  winning author that's suing the federal government over the NDAA joins us but
[47:44.340 --> 47:53.500]  there's limbaugh and and you read Rand Paul's statement he was held for two
[47:53.500 --> 47:58.460]  hours and told he couldn't leave and just like when there's thousands of
[47:58.460 --> 48:02.420]  ideas of him groping women's shoulder and hands down pants what does TSA always
[48:02.420 --> 48:05.300]  do when they're confronted on TV they go we don't do that they put out statements
[48:05.300 --> 48:09.860]  we don't do that and they say oh well in the pants we don't call that in the
[48:09.860 --> 48:13.100]  pants oh a strip search we take your clothes off but that's not a strip search
[48:13.100 --> 48:18.660]  well there's radiation but we say it's not bad for you just a pure culture of
[48:18.660 --> 48:26.460]  lying but so what it's us the unwashed masses what did one of the Rockefellers
[48:26.460 --> 48:31.660]  tell Aaron Russo in an interview I did with him Aaron knew he was pretty much
[48:31.660 --> 48:35.800]  a dead man gonna die so he kind of gave that deathbed he died a few months later
[48:35.800 --> 48:39.580]  talk with us he couldn't even really walk when I went and met with him in
[48:39.580 --> 48:43.020]  Houston outside the cancer research facility he was ready to tell the story
[48:43.020 --> 48:46.580]  of Nick Rockefeller Nick Rockefeller said yeah we're all gonna have chips in
[48:46.580 --> 48:50.860]  us and our chip is gonna tell the police we've got diplomatic immunity and we can
[48:50.860 --> 48:55.540]  do whatever we want we're gonna walk through the airports we're not gonna
[48:55.540 --> 49:00.460]  they're gonna be able to stop us and I already see that in the news or in
[49:00.460 --> 49:04.380]  California other areas the license plates of government employees can't
[49:04.380 --> 49:10.580]  even be read and where they live is secret and now the military gets to go
[49:10.580 --> 49:14.660]  through their own line oh the military can be trusted but citizens can't because
[49:14.660 --> 49:18.180]  they're the enemy not only is the military gonna operate domestically
[49:18.180 --> 49:20.620]  something you never do in a free society because the military fights an
[49:20.620 --> 49:24.180]  enemy and because every third world despotic country has the military
[49:24.180 --> 49:29.500]  domestically but now they're even separating a more where the bureaucrats
[49:29.500 --> 49:32.260]  the pilots said we're not gonna be part of this so they're left alone the
[49:32.260 --> 49:38.300]  military goes through their own line and doesn't get searched they're now
[49:38.300 --> 49:44.340]  putting that in place but we the little citizen scumbags we have absolutely no
[49:44.340 --> 49:54.220]  rights and that's the elite plan and Nick Rockefeller was telling him that it
[49:54.220 --> 49:57.020]  was gonna be and he gave me photos of him with Nick Rockefeller we looked it
[49:57.020 --> 50:01.620]  up sure enough it's Nick Rockefeller part of the Rockefeller family lives in
[50:01.620 --> 50:07.620]  China most the time running big operations form over there but now
[50:07.620 --> 50:10.620]  they're just and they're gonna skip the chip it's gonna be a face scan but then
[50:10.620 --> 50:15.100]  you'll have a special RFID on your card and the cops are not allowed to stop you
[50:15.100 --> 50:18.180]  you're like well how do they do that it's already in common law for senators
[50:18.180 --> 50:23.260]  and House members and it's for the UN has it the globalist are gonna have
[50:23.260 --> 50:28.860]  global get out of jail free cards well the rest of us can just be secretly
[50:28.860 --> 50:34.180]  arrested and disappeared for no reason they are scientifically codifying total
[50:34.180 --> 50:38.380]  evil and why a lot of people send me emails and go well I'm going along with
[50:38.380 --> 50:41.580]  the system I don't have to worry about the system is gonna shut off all the
[50:41.580 --> 50:47.540]  resources on purpose to consolidate control they want you so poor you can't
[50:47.540 --> 50:52.420]  even think about resisting the UN says that's why they want people to be poor
[50:52.420 --> 50:56.420]  worldwide all right I'm gonna get into the even bigger news with George Soros
[50:56.420 --> 51:00.460]  when we come back then we got to pull a surprise when I joined
[51:00.460 --> 51:06.900]  hello I'm Alex Jones myself my family the info wars.com team want to relay to

[55:34.220 --> 55:38.180]  beast the division of Newsweek sorrows from Davos it's going on right now
[55:38.180 --> 55:43.180]  warns of violent riots in America financial collapse government clampdown
[55:43.180 --> 55:47.660]  he says survival is the most important thing there's gonna sit down interview
[55:47.660 --> 55:55.340]  with the Daily Beast and he said he's never seen something this bad he says
[55:55.340 --> 55:59.860]  from surviving the Nazi occupation of Hungary during World War two to single
[55:59.860 --> 56:03.900]  handedly crushing the currencies of entire nations the experience he brings
[56:03.900 --> 56:09.780]  the table should not be ignored this is a mark slavo article info wars calm you
[56:09.780 --> 56:12.220]  know I was trying to look for during the break I've seen it many times that may
[56:12.220 --> 56:15.940]  have pulled it but he was on 60 minutes a decade ago it admitted to being a
[56:15.940 --> 56:20.740]  Nazi sympathizer who helped round up fellow Jews in Hungary and he said well
[56:20.740 --> 56:24.100]  if I didn't do it somebody else would have so he doesn't feel bad for it now
[56:24.100 --> 56:27.220]  wanted to play that on the nightly news tonight but do's and they're looking for
[56:27.220 --> 56:31.780]  like 30 minutes I can't find it he even remembered the quotes can somebody find
[56:31.780 --> 56:38.620]  that video and email it to show tips and info wars calm I mean I'm sure we're
[56:38.620 --> 56:42.740]  gonna find it but I think he needs to be all over YouTube he must be jerking it
[56:42.740 --> 56:47.740]  down because I want to I want to get the truth about Soros out but but the point
[56:47.740 --> 56:51.540]  here by the way speaking to Glenn Beck when Glenn Beck actually had the
[56:51.540 --> 56:56.060]  courage to play clips of this and talk about it and Soros threatened to come
[56:56.060 --> 57:02.020]  after him and then said the media implied it was anti-semitic to talk about how
[57:02.020 --> 57:08.140]  Soros helped track down and make sure and find Jews property and and and help
[57:08.140 --> 57:12.860]  take it and so now if you're not for hunting down Jews and taking their
[57:12.860 --> 57:16.860]  property or anti-semitic I mean this is the upside down world and the ADL said
[57:16.860 --> 57:20.420]  they were concerned and you know you don't talk about Soros like that it's
[57:20.420 --> 57:29.660]  just so sick it's so sick it's sick it's sick it's sick it's sickening have
[57:29.660 --> 57:34.540]  people making jokes about Ron Paul getting groped and Rand Paul and people
[57:34.540 --> 57:40.340]  getting detained and saying oh they're like Muslim terrorist it's sick it's
[57:40.340 --> 57:44.220]  sick to have all these TV shows glorifying torture including of
[57:44.220 --> 57:47.780]  people's children to get answers and then in the real world the military is
[57:47.780 --> 57:53.860]  torturing children and the army's own report that's sick that's dangerous and
[57:53.860 --> 57:59.180]  it will be used on us like Ron Paul has said about the NDA and some of these some
[57:59.180 --> 58:03.300]  of these debates he said hey it could be you next media why are you go don't you
[58:03.300 --> 58:07.460]  get it it is gonna be for us the new order hates Americans a lot more than
[58:07.460 --> 58:12.980]  they hate Muslims or foreigners they've always hated us what I think they they
[58:12.980 --> 58:18.220]  have incentives to ship our jobs overseas so so Soros who said he's was
[58:18.220 --> 58:22.060]  having a great crisis few years ago who says he's pulling all his money out of
[58:22.060 --> 58:26.380]  the markets for total collapse he's now acting like he's upset when he's one of
[58:26.380 --> 58:30.860]  the main authors of it and at Davos they're saying they're gonna help us
[58:30.860 --> 58:34.500]  get rid of capitalism and bring in a new socialism to make it all fair that
[58:34.500 --> 58:37.900]  means give all the money themselves and they're debating how to be moral right

[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:41.900]  Obama administration over the NDAA that could be used against himself and
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.980]  others that they've been targeting not just whistleblowers but journalists that
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:50.860]  talk to whistleblowers about corruption from torture to you name it you know in
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.940]  the new system somebody like Sy Hirsch you know would end up being thrown in
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:59.180]  prison so he's doing something that's absolutely needed so we're gonna be
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:04.980]  talking to him about that coming up Ron Paul has been ignored in the GOP debate
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:09.500]  once again congressman was afforded less time than any other speaker and his
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:13.660]  only big question was asked when are you gonna drop out to imply like he's on a
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:19.380]  real candidate in number two position in most states with this rent a candidate
[01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:26.340]  Mitt Romney this corporate plastic Republican version of Obama because
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:31.980]  they're both slick they're both you know handsome men they both can lie well and
[01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:37.620]  makes pretty much stand with the very same policies I mean this should
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:41.420]  conservatives always talk about not liking rhinos and not liking fake
[01:01:41.420 --> 01:01:47.020]  conservatives I mean it's getting worse it's not getting better I don't want to
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:50.780]  hear any criticism of liberals that supported Obama thinking they'd get all
[01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.220]  these free goodies and the whole world would be great he was he's owned by the
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:58.580]  very same mega banks he just hired the former head of Bain Capital one of the
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:03.540]  colleagues of Mitt Romney to head up the financial stuff and replace daily I
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:08.660]  mean it's just absolutely the same pedigree the same crew politically it's
[01:02:08.660 --> 01:02:13.660]  the same political pedigree the same political funders the same political
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:18.460]  system these ruthless mega corporations that are not free market that are
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:21.860]  turning our world into a fascist structure I don't just use the word
[01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:26.460]  fascist because it's you know a fun word like you know Hitler this Hitler that
[01:02:26.460 --> 01:02:33.020]  fascism is what this is when government is there to give contracts and to have a
[01:02:33.020 --> 01:02:39.100]  controlled economy for a select group of free market systems and the black
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:45.940]  uniforms of the secret police and the warlike expansionist tendencies the
[01:02:45.940 --> 01:02:52.900]  cameras I mean it's got all the telltale it's a perfect fascism and it's here
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:59.260]  and it's growing like a cancer and Rush Limbaugh makes jokes and says so what
[01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:04.180]  of Rand Paul is detained for two hours Ron Paul deserves to be because he's
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:10.060]  like a domestic terrorist sounds like an Islamic terrorist for just saying let's
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:14.580]  not launch new wars let's we're going bankrupt see the big mega corporations
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:18.220]  that are getting the no bid contracts the oil and dominating the globe they
[01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.460]  don't care of America goes bankrupt they want it to because then we're in debt
[01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:25.380]  to them because they're controlled by the big mega banks that issue with the
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:29.700]  currency and credit they want to get us into debt because they're getting us into
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:35.060]  made-up debt they get the world for nothing out of a giant militarized Ponzi
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:40.740]  scheme see a smart Ponzi scheme doesn't implode like Ponzi or made-off who are
[01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:44.860]  just low-level people like Ken Lay people think of them as high level well
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:49.660]  that's about as high levels as the system burns they're mid-level overall in the
[01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:53.300]  scheme low level if you compare it to the real owners of the system but a smart
[01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:57.540]  Ponzi scheme has a propaganda system and is backed up by military force and
[01:03:57.540 --> 01:04:02.900]  threatens the entire system it's so big that they say if you cut out the cancer
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:08.020]  the system bleeds to death so the answer is the cancer just grows and grows and
[01:04:08.020 --> 01:04:14.700]  grows and holds everyone hostage and things get worse by increment and then
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:19.020]  now oh they are doing military drills for the American people oh those weren't
[01:04:19.020 --> 01:04:23.660]  drills for overseas oh they are asking your kids in the public schools and
[01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:28.300]  private schools and you know what a mommy and daddy do politically oh they

[01:08:54.100 --> 01:09:00.780]  the whole thing red spotlights to mark pre-crime suspects and the whole piece
[01:09:00.780 --> 01:09:11.340]  is done like a cartoon we do have him now okay the videos ready it is like a
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:18.340]  cartoon in that it is so incredibly ridiculous it's it it's like if I was
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:22.660]  making a video about a joke police state with a simpering voice creamily
[01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:27.460]  talking about the security and how much the citizens love the cameras and the
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:31.500]  license plate readers in the town and the red spotlight that spotlights them
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:35.580]  from hundreds of yards away and the police getting off on it but it's not a
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:41.460]  joke it's not a 1984 remake it's New Jersey now let's go and go to part of
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:47.340]  that clip it almost looks like a scene from the science fiction movie minority
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:51.620]  report a New Jersey City is going to start marking people with a red light
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:57.340]  before they might commit a crime the police chief in East Orange William
[01:09:57.340 --> 01:10:02.380]  Robinson is embracing it as the latest pre-crime law enforcement technique
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:08.060]  we're as London have talking cameras we're about to deploy light projecting
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:13.940]  cameras better known as light-based intervention systems the directed red
[01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:18.380]  lights will be attached to existing surveillance cameras and can shoot a
[01:10:18.380 --> 01:10:23.620]  light beam a full city block away if a police officer monitoring one of the
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.940]  city's many high-def cameras sees a crime about to occur like someone about to
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:34.300]  get mugged they will remotely bathe the would-be perpetrator in red light the
[01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:39.740]  message to the criminals is the police are observing you the police are
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:44.900]  recording you and the police are responding a few years ago East Orange
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:49.460]  had one of the worst crime rates in the state as rival Cripps and Bloods Gangs
[01:10:49.460 --> 01:10:54.020]  battled and sold drugs the city used federal grant money to invest in lots
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.700]  of new technology which the chief says has brought crime down to the lowest
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:05.420]  level since the 1960s daily policing here is all high-tech sensors attached to
[01:11:05.420 --> 01:11:10.100]  the top of patrol cars instantly read the license plates of all vehicles the
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:15.740]  car passes a monitor shows a picture of the car owner okay so there is the
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:20.780]  Associated Press and the whole thing is like something out of Stephen King's
[01:11:20.780 --> 01:11:25.820]  The Running Man or a remake of 1984 where how wonderful it is and there's
[01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:30.060]  telescreens telling you to watch out for terrorists and they're going in Walmart
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:34.820]  and the citizens are spying on each other and it's to stop the drugs which we all
[01:11:34.820 --> 01:11:39.940]  know are grown in Afghanistan under the military's watchful gaze it is off the
[01:11:39.940 --> 01:11:44.540]  charts how the system isn't trying to hide the authoritarian system now it's
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:49.620]  it's it's coming out with it in the most absurdist ridiculous over-the-top way
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:55.980]  hiding it in plain view now we have a very eloquent gentleman joining us
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:00.020]  always enjoy reading his articles and also watching speeches he gives Chris
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:03.780]  Hedges is a Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist author and war
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:07.820]  correspondent specializing in American politics and Middle Eastern politics and
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:11.420]  societies currently a senior fellow at the Nation Institute in New York City
[01:12:11.420 --> 01:12:15.820]  he was a foreign correspondent for the New York Times for 15 years he was
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:21.220]  reported for more than 50 countries and he's got a bunch of best-selling books
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:26.660]  latest the world as we know it and he is as you know suing we appreciate him
[01:12:26.660 --> 01:12:33.020]  coming on in such a busy schedule right now he started a class-action suit over
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.340]  the indefinite detention law because we've seen whistleblowers and journalists
[01:12:36.340 --> 01:12:40.260]  that talk to him now being persecuted and the way this is written it affects
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:45.060]  journalists so he joins us to talk about this and the state of the world Chris
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:49.100]  great to have you on with us thank you do you ever pinch yourself and think that
[01:12:49.100 --> 01:12:55.300]  you might be asleep I think the rest of the country is asleep well that's
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:13:01.500]  certainly true well give us your take on the NDA and why you've decided to carry
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:04.740]  out this class-action suit well the lawyers actually approached me because
[01:13:04.740 --> 01:13:09.100]  they needed a credible plaintiff and since I had been the Middle East Bureau
[01:13:09.100 --> 01:13:13.100]  chief for the New York Times and had been in the region for seven years I'd
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.740]  had frequent contact with both individuals and groups that are defined
[01:13:16.740 --> 01:13:21.020]  by the US State Department as either terrorist terrorists or terrorist
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:28.100]  organizations that would include Hamas, Islamic Jihad and Gaza the old PLO is to
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:32.620]  go to Tunis and see Arafat and Abu Jihad when they were both branded as
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:37.820]  international terrorists the Kurdistan Workers Party or the PKK so the language
[01:13:37.820 --> 01:13:43.700]  of the bill offers no exemptions for journalists it is amorphous and frightening
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:50.300]  you know nebulous terms like substantially supported associated forces
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:56.420]  and in the reading of these lawyers and I think frankly a lot of lawyers it leaves
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:02.660]  a lot of room for the state to use the military overturning over 200 years of
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:08.300]  domestic law as a policing agent to snatch American citizens from American
[01:14:08.300 --> 01:14:12.700]  soil strip of the due process and hold them in military detention facilities
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:17.860]  including Guantanamo so it is a staggering assault against our
[01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.260]  constitutional rights and I certainly agreed to be a plaintiff it's not a
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:26.100]  class-action suit we're not asking for money we're just asking for the law to
[01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:30.980]  be overturned they're assigning a judge in the Southern District Court in New
[01:14:30.980 --> 01:14:36.940]  York and if we can move quickly hopefully we can get an injunction
[01:14:36.940 --> 01:14:41.380]  because this legislation is supposed to go into effect in March okay so to
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:45.220]  correct that the media when I was reading from got that wrong I I guess
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.860]  they may have said class-action because other reporters can join if they have
[01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:53.660]  standing or is that not the case they haven't gone out and I mean I think that
[01:14:53.660 --> 01:15:00.380]  mine is such a peculiar history that they feel they don't really need got it
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:05.740]  they don't need I mean aren't many Americans who spent the kind of time
[01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:11.180]  that I have with these groups so they feel it's you know I'm pretty solid as
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:14.500]  a plaintiff so they're not going looking for other plaintiffs so basically you
[01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:18.100]  have the perfect standing as the former New York Times bureau chief over there
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:23.220]  and you know as your job meeting with all these groups I mean I would be
[01:15:23.220 --> 01:15:26.660]  genuinely concerned because they all you know claimed at the time the the
[01:15:26.660 --> 01:15:31.380]  establishment did the authoritarian supporters that the Patriot Act wouldn't
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:35.240]  be used in non-terror related cases or on citizens now they admitted to use
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.340]  thousands of times a year per state even at the state level I mean they're
[01:15:39.340 --> 01:15:42.700]  using all of this well this is an important point you know when they
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:48.420]  passed the 2001 legislation what we got was this sort of radical interpretation
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:55.300]  of it by Bush's legal advisor John you and others and that's Jose Padilla who
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:16:00.740]  is an American citizen allegedly was one of the hijackers who didn't make it on
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:05.900]  a plane held for three and a half years by the military now that is a situation
[01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:10.060]  gets challenged legally goes to the Supreme Court and before the Supreme
[01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:14.460]  Court rules Padilla's turned over to a civilian court the Supreme Court would
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:19.980]  not rule on it rendering saying that it was now moot I think they just sort of
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:24.460]  it became a way for them not to wait into that controversy we have on where a
[01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:30.420]  locky a Yemeni cleric and the executive branch again using that 2001
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:36.420]  legislation serves as judge jury and executioner although he is a US citizen
[01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:42.900]  in order to do the assassination so yeah I mean it is this essentially
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:52.140]  codifies into place legalizes this kind of activity and and I think importantly
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:58.100]  it frees the state up from going after groups that under the low old legislation
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:02.260]  you couldn't do this unless people were directly tied to al-Qaeda or had some
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:07.060]  kind of tangential involvement in 9-11 now you can go after groups that didn't
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:14.260]  even exist in 2001 these so-called associated forces I mean a lot of these
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:19.740]  groups in Yemen and Somalia weren't even around in 9-11 so yeah it's it's
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:25.700]  pretty serious well it certainly is look there was a liberty dollar case you
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:30.180]  probably didn't see it but the Associated Press and other publications
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:36.580]  wrote about it and Bernard von Note house had the royal Hawaiian men all
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:41.020]  these other you know groups putting out commemorative coins well he put out a
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:48.060]  liberty dollar and in the after conviction ruling for counterfeiting the
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:53.660]  FBI and the US Attorney said this guy's a domestic terrorist he's a unique form
[01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:58.580]  of terrorism and so we want the full 22 years of that he can get for this so I
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:03.740]  more and more in cases also hear them use that terrorism term and we see the
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:07.980]  military industrial complex building up we have no fly lists that you can't
[01:18:07.980 --> 01:18:12.740]  find out how you get on the list or how you get off all these you know domestic
[01:18:12.740 --> 01:18:18.580]  spying agencies we've gotten the Mayak and Homeland Security reports that list
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:25.380]  gun owners libertarians anti-war activists as affiliated with terrorism so
[01:18:25.380 --> 01:18:29.980]  I mean I see this being used across the board I mean even the senators involved
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:33.180]  that supported it said you better affect citizens when there was a debate
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:37.820]  about that the NDAA you know we killed the locky we'll kill citizens if we
[01:18:37.820 --> 01:18:43.580]  want and then Lieberman said we want to scare people I'm sure you've probably
[01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:48.900]  seen those creepy quotes yeah well there's no question if you read the
[01:18:48.900 --> 01:18:55.500]  legislation that this includes American citizens and there's also no question
[01:18:55.500 --> 01:19:00.500]  that it's a it's a direct and egregious violation of our constitutional rights
[01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:04.580]  now the lawyers feel that because of that it has a pretty good chance of
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:08.140]  getting to the Supreme Court but the court's so stacked with corporate
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:15.380]  stuges that you know we're not at all sure that that it's gonna it's gonna
[01:19:15.380 --> 01:19:18.660]  get through the Supreme Court the Supreme Court will we will either hear it
[01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:27.580]  or you know rule in our favor so I mean I think it's still worth doing and it's
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:30.940]  important and you're right I mean look at what happened in the drug wars I mean
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:35.020]  first they institute testing for prisoners then they institute testings
[01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.940]  for people looking for jobs and people applying for weapons and it always
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:42.820]  creeps out where you don't want to hand the state these kinds of powers and if
[01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:48.540]  there is any kind of serious unrest if the power elite feels threatened from
[01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.140]  whatever from popular movements or this essentially allows them to call in the
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:56.220]  army and I and I don't know what the motives to the bill is I mean I do find
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:20:01.020]  it interesting that all of the intelligence agencies the FBI to CIA the
[01:20:01.020 --> 01:20:04.660]  national intelligence agency even the Attorney General's office were against
[01:20:04.660 --> 01:20:08.340]  this piece of legislation the Pentagon was against it so you have to ask why
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:12.940]  does it pass why is it being pushed through Robert Mueller for the head of
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:17.340]  the FBI actually went up to Congress and testified that passing this
[01:20:17.340 --> 01:20:20.900]  legislation would make the work of the FBI more difficult because it would be
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:25.580]  harder to get people to cooperate if you extend these kinds of powers to the
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:30.220]  military and yet it passes anyway and I think the way the legislation is written
[01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:38.580]  it gives a kind of iron bar to those who want to crush internal dissent you know
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:42.180]  maybe they don't trust the police finally put to protect them and this
[01:20:42.180 --> 01:20:46.340]  allows them to call in the US military yeah for those that haven't read the
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:50.540]  bill it gets rid of posse commentatus it it also declares that they can
[01:20:50.540 --> 01:20:54.660]  basically kill anybody globally whenever they want which I really see as a
[01:20:54.660 --> 01:20:59.380]  transference of war powers completely out of Congress into the office of the
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:04.820]  presidency right and that was the battle between Carl Evans office and the
[01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:08.900]  White House was never over the denial of due process it was over the fact that
[01:21:08.900 --> 01:21:16.420]  Obama wanted these powers in his hands and he wanted the ability to either
[01:21:16.420 --> 01:21:22.060]  target he select those who would be targeted or offer them exemptions and
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:25.060]  he got it that's what he got but it was there was never an argument at all
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:29.340]  Diane Feinstein actually proposed language that would have exempted
[01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:33.620]  American citizens and both the Obama White House and a Democratic leadership
[01:21:33.620 --> 01:21:37.980]  turned it down so we're talking about divine right of king type stuff but
[01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:43.060]  generally even kings and ancient Europe and feudal times as you know I had to
[01:21:43.060 --> 01:21:48.260]  trump up something this is just we'll do whatever we want but but don't worry
[01:21:48.260 --> 01:21:54.660]  Obama and Mitt Romney have both said you can trust us we won't abuse this well
[01:21:54.660 --> 01:21:59.020]  you know he did Obama issued a signing statement that said that it would not be
[01:21:59.020 --> 01:22:03.020]  used on American citizens well that begs the question then why didn't you put
[01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:08.660]  that in the legislation the legislation does permit these kinds of draconian
[01:22:08.660 --> 01:22:11.780]  forms of control stripping of legal rights to be carried out against you a
[01:22:11.780 --> 01:22:15.300]  citizen so if it's not your intent to use it on American citizens and you
[01:22:15.300 --> 01:22:18.220]  should have put that in the bill well Chris that's what's even scarier I want
[01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:21.660]  to get your view on this again a Pulitzer Prize winner best-selling
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:26.700]  author researcher journalist Chris Hedges is our guest why also the exercise of
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:31.060]  deception I mean early on two months ago it doesn't affect citizens and has
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:36.260]  that deceptive language where it says your exempt except this section says
[01:22:36.260 --> 01:22:40.420]  you're not and then they deny it affects citizens for a while then the White
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:44.540]  House says they're against it then they blame Carl Levin he says hey you told us
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:51.500]  to do this and then after it passes we see this victory lap by Graham and
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:56.500]  others of the senators saying you bet it affects citizens almost like a weird
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:02.220]  celebration with hopping up and down by some of the senators I mean this is this
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:08.100]  is like a science fiction movie with caricatures of bad guys well because it's
[01:23:08.100 --> 01:23:12.620]  like Obamacare they figure no one's gonna read it actually this is quite
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:16.220]  readable you can pull it up on the web it's not that long Obamacare's 2,000
[01:23:16.220 --> 01:23:22.020]  pages of corporate malfeasance so they're just assuming that people won't
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:27.500]  read the legislation and and they spin it they but you know it's completely
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:32.100]  disingenuous now that's a very kind word to use about the Obama White House
[01:23:32.100 --> 01:23:35.660]  and their characterization of what this bill does I mean it's pretty clear you
[01:23:35.660 --> 01:23:39.180]  don't have to be you don't have to go to Harvard Law School to figure out figure
[01:23:39.180 --> 01:23:42.100]  out what they're saying I want to talk more about your case and so many other
[01:23:42.100 --> 01:23:45.780]  issues and limited time we have with you but separately you probably haven't
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:48.700]  heard it because it just happened yesterday we played the clip in the
[01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:54.260]  last hour Rush Limbaugh has come out and said basically that Ron Paul Rand Paul
[01:23:54.260 --> 01:23:59.380]  had both complained about being detained and harassed by TSA and groped that they
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:05.180]  sound like Islamic terrorists and deserve and I'm reading quotes here you
[01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:09.740]  know that the TSA needed to do this and so now we're even starting to hear well
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:13.660]  Ron Paul doesn't want a war with Iran he's with the terrorists doesn't matter
[01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:17.900]  if as you mentioned most the experts and the CIA and the government say don't
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:24.940]  have a war it doesn't matter if if the whole TSA thing is blatantly
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:30.660]  unconstitutional we're now even hearing kind of the neocon mouthpieces more and
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:36.460]  more talk about public figures as being terrorist well I hadn't heard that I mean
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:40.820]  there's a reason corporate sponsors pay him for what is he earned four million
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:45.820]  dollars a year I think it's more like 15 million a year really yeah he's got a
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:51.220]  hundred million dollar contract yeah yeah well I mean you know let's follow
[01:24:51.220 --> 01:24:54.580]  the money I mean who does he work for who pays them and what is he saying and
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:24:58.500]  what you know why is he why is he getting that much money the rest of us
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:04.420]  don't get that much money what is your view of Ron Paul overall on the whole
[01:25:04.420 --> 01:25:08.380]  war issue because the corporate media tries to act like he's crazy but I mean
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:11.740]  that the former head of the massage agrees with him the last two chairman of
[01:25:11.740 --> 01:25:15.700]  the Joint Chiefs of Staff agree with him on Iran I mean most of the experts
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:19.540]  agree with him but then there's this hoax that people that don't want a bunch
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:24.660]  of new wars are the bad guys no on the issue of the wars I'm totally in agreement
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:28.940]  with Ron Paul and I speak as somebody who spent a lot of time in Iran and of
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:34.540]  course a lot of time in the region the an assault on Iran would just be
[01:25:34.540 --> 01:25:39.740]  catastrophic it would trigger a regional war not to mention thousands of thousands
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:44.420]  of debt because most of these facilities are built in highly dense or densely
[01:25:44.420 --> 01:25:49.620]  populated areas so it would trigger a kind of war if she is remember Iraq is
[01:25:49.620 --> 01:25:56.740]  60% sure now it's just yeah so on the issues of the war I think and not only
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:02.580]  the war but the issue of internal activity by the security and surveillance
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:06.300]  state I think Ron Paul is one of the few voices I don't know if he's in the
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:09.540]  mainstream but you know at least he can get up on the debates he's one of the
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:16.140]  very few voices that that is speaking out getting back specifically to your
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:22.900]  lawsuit what's the timetable on this women we know and what is your lawsuit
[01:26:22.900 --> 01:26:29.900]  basically declaring it's asking that the the the law be annulled because it's
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:36.520]  unconstitutional that we're not asking for anything else now if they find a
[01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:41.100]  judge we're trying to find out who it is if you know we know the records of the
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:45.180]  judges which are actually not bad on civil liberties in the southern district
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:51.580]  court and if they feel that the judge is open to hearing this case they'll push
[01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:58.500]  for letting litigation before March so that they can delay the law they can
[01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:03.340]  have the law essentially put in abeyance until the case is heard which
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:13.100]  that that is the current tactic Chris going back to why the system is doing
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:17.660]  this I've got another angle I want you to comment on and get your take on I have
[01:27:17.660 --> 01:27:23.140]  seen this NDA and the SOPA bill and all of this wake people up who were asleep
[01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:28.500]  like nothing I've ever seen before I mean I'd say the response is 10 15 times
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.180]  what the Patriot Act was a are you seeing it wake people up and be why do
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:37.580]  you think it's way starting to wake people up well I think you know there
[01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:45.380]  there's all sorts of intrusions into our life that are no longer theoretical the
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:51.020]  passage of the Pfizer reform bill in essence makes legal what under our
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:55.900]  Constitution has traditionally been illegal and does so retroactively the
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:59.900]  warrantless wiretapping monitoring and eavesdropping of tens of millions of
[01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:03.060]  Americans of the SOPA bill as you pointed out I mean I think it's just too
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:08.140]  hard to ignore my understanding that the poll the polling on the NDA is that
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:12.060]  only between two and nine percent of the American public supports it has no
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:15.420]  public support the Pfizer reform act didn't have any public support either
[01:28:15.420 --> 01:28:19.820]  they're powerful corporate forces that want to ram it through because it
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:26.500]  protects them and this narrow oligarchic elite but but it it's left a really bad
[01:28:26.500 --> 01:28:31.580]  taste in the mouths of the vast majority of an American public and this is not a
[01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:36.780]  left-right issue you know you have even figures like Rick Santorum
[01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:41.380]  it is it has to do with the basic issue of civil liberties which cuts
[01:28:41.380 --> 01:28:45.740]  across the political spectrum so at least on the ground I think you know the
[01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:50.580]  vast majority of Americans seem to be behind us whether the courts you know
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:54.020]  will rule on behalf of the citizens a rule finally on behalf of the
[01:28:54.020 --> 01:28:58.100]  corporations will have to find out well I was about to raise the left-right
[01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:03.940]  issue issues like the TSA warrantless wiretaps secret arrest torture this is
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:09.660]  something unifying America and it's really becoming clear that it's a tag
[01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:13.780]  team with the Republicans and Democrats and that for all intents and purposes
[01:29:13.780 --> 01:29:18.380]  it's a corrupt political corporate ruling class that is authoritarian and
[01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:23.940]  that is dangerous and that is growing like a cancer well that's my take well
[01:29:23.940 --> 01:29:27.540]  let's get your take on the world talk about your latest book and in just five
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:31.300]  six minutes we have left on the other side with Chris Hedges Pulitzer Prize

[01:33:22.780 --> 01:33:27.340]  news.com that we've been beta testing the last five months for television that
[01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:32.580]  prisonplanet.tv viewers can watch we have a 15-day free trial subscription
[01:33:32.580 --> 01:33:35.900]  running right there and then of course those of you that support the site
[01:33:35.900 --> 01:33:39.100]  you're basically paying for it for everybody else which is great we then
[01:33:39.100 --> 01:33:42.580]  put it on YouTube and everywhere else a few days later and it gets millions of
[01:33:42.580 --> 01:33:47.580]  views every week and it's only five months and we're in existence we're
[01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:51.020]  putting a lot of time and energy obviously into this more energy than we
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:55.460]  do even in the radio show so if you're not a viewer of it now is the time to
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:59.580]  support the alternative true independent media now going back to Chris
[01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:04.420]  Hedges the best website to read his amazing essays is truth dig dot com
[01:34:04.420 --> 01:34:09.580]  forward slash Chris Hedges that's truth dig dot com forward slash Chris Hedges
[01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:13.940]  also I was asking which book he thinks is the most important right now and it's
[01:34:13.940 --> 01:34:18.180]  actually not his group of essays from last year the world as we know it it's a
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:22.460]  death of the liberal class and I wanted it in the six seven minutes we have left
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:27.740]  with him to kind of give him the floor to talk about whatever he thinks is most
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:34.140]  important and where he sees this society going right now Chris well I think
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:38.660]  that the mistake is that the liberal class somehow meant to be the political
[01:34:38.660 --> 01:34:44.660]  left the liberal class is of the kind of safety valve that makes incremental and
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:48.940]  piecemeal reform possible that's what you saw with Roosevelt on the new deal
[01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:55.580]  and and what's happened is that essentially traditional liberal
[01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:59.980]  politicians as well as the Democratic Party have become completely hostage to
[01:34:59.980 --> 01:35:04.980]  corporate power so you get the rise of self-identified liberals like Bill
[01:35:04.980 --> 01:35:10.380]  Clinton who pushed through NAFTA which is the greatest betrayal of working men
[01:35:10.380 --> 01:35:17.860]  women in this country since the Taft-Harley Act who deregulate the FCC so
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:21.900]  that Rupert Murdoch and and Clear Channel can buy up thousands of stations
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:27.300]  who ripped down the firewalls between commercial and investment banks known as
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:30.380]  the Glass-Steagall Act all this is done under Clinton including of course the
[01:35:30.380 --> 01:35:35.620]  destruction of welfare and so these are you know a kind of betrayal of core
[01:35:35.620 --> 01:35:41.020]  liberal values done by the liberal establishment for corporate money and
[01:35:41.020 --> 01:35:45.140]  Clinton knew that if he did corporate bidding he would get that money so that
[01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:50.140]  by the 1990s the Democratic Party in terms of corporate dollars has fund
[01:35:50.140 --> 01:35:54.020]  raising parity with the Republicans and by the time Barack Obama runs for
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:36:01.180]  president in 2004 he gets more and that is the issue that the popular movements
[01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:08.980]  the populist movements that expressed the sentiments from the base whether those
[01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:13.940]  were old labor unions or the Wobblies or an independent press or they were
[01:36:13.940 --> 01:36:19.100]  pretty much destroyed in the Red Scare and you just mentioned the attacks
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:25.340]  against Ron Paul in the name of sort of being soft on terrorism or I think you
[01:36:25.340 --> 01:36:29.940]  even said that he was accused of being you know a terrorist himself I mean
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.540]  that's what they would have done 50 years ago to discredit him they would
[01:36:32.540 --> 01:36:37.580]  have they would have said he's soft on communism it's exactly the same kind of
[01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:41.460]  iconography the same kind of language that's used by the power elite to
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:46.740]  discredit legitimate criticism and legitimate dissent and I think that
[01:36:46.740 --> 01:36:53.180]  that's what's happening the anger of the liberal class is not misplaced people
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:59.380]  have been betrayed by these figures like Obama like Clinton like Pelosi like
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:04.020]  Carl Levin like the leadership of the Democratic Party that speaks in that
[01:37:04.020 --> 01:37:10.860]  traditional feel your pain language and yet carries out policies that are as
[01:37:10.860 --> 01:37:14.540]  craven to corporate interests as those that are carried out by the Republican
[01:37:14.540 --> 01:37:19.220]  Party well looking at these big corporate interest I mean we see people
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:23.300]  like the head of MF global making 40 to 1 bets with other people's money
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:28.860]  Corzine gets caught lying in Congress you know the the head of the Chicago
[01:37:28.860 --> 01:37:32.540]  mercantile exchange says no we were there he knew of course he gave the order to
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:36.420]  take the private accounts and no one gets in trouble I mean there's a new
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:41.900]  level of of just getting away with everything and when you learn that this
[01:37:41.900 --> 01:37:48.300]  corporate insider crony capitalist class is running things and and and and are
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:52.780]  so hubris filled or maybe it's not a hubris of maybe they are godlike now
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:56.860]  because of corruption and and because of the public's weakness or whatever that
[01:37:56.860 --> 01:38:02.020]  they can make 40 to 1 bets I mean that shows that these people are insane well
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:07.020]  look at Goldman Sachs they're bailed out with taxpayer money and then they're
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:13.820]  given virtually interest-free loans to gamble I mean you sort of can't lose I
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:20.620]  don't know what to call it it's not capitalism and there's been no punishment
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:24.420]  except for Bernie Madoff and that's because he stole from rich people yeah
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:28.260]  nobody gets punished I mean these people are all back doing what they were doing
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:31.380]  before except now they're doing it with our money and at a higher level you're
[01:38:31.380 --> 01:38:35.100]  right derivatives or what about people like Cass Sunstein openly putting out
[01:38:35.100 --> 01:38:39.860]  papers saying we'll arrest people we disagree with but first we'll just have
[01:38:39.860 --> 01:38:44.620]  takedown orders of their sites on the web and then we see that in SOPA I mean
[01:38:44.620 --> 01:38:50.760]  the thing is they're so honest about their authoritarianism and then the we
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:55.540]  get criticized for for being gloom and doomers yeah well they are rather
[01:38:55.540 --> 01:39:01.260]  amazingly honest about it because they think they're untouchable and you see
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:05.180]  that with the kinds of statements made by figures like Lloyd Blank fine from
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:10.900]  Goldman Sachs God's work they own they own the process they know they own the
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:18.940]  process and and and they feel that there is no and they're right internally
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:22.820]  there is no power that can touch them either from the judicial branch or the
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:28.260]  legislative branch and and that's why I think they see the rise of the occupy
[01:39:28.260 --> 01:39:34.060]  movements and other grassroots movements as such a threat because that anger and
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:39.020]  and that outrage is is being expressed outside the system and so they're
[01:39:39.020 --> 01:39:42.620]  looking for all the tools they can whether it's SOPA or the NDA or anything
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:50.220]  else to crush it well you're right and I mean in closing at first they tried to
[01:39:50.220 --> 01:39:54.860]  co-opt it in and when we saw all these big bank heads endorse it no bomb
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:58.140]  endorse it but as soon as they couldn't co-opt it we now learn there was
[01:39:58.140 --> 01:40:03.220]  simultaneous homeland security coordination sweeping them off the
[01:40:03.220 --> 01:40:08.900]  streets violating basic bill of rights like tenement square or something I
[01:40:08.900 --> 01:40:13.500]  mean it's really scary and and I think what's going to bring these guys down I
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.500]  want your take on this in closing Chris we appreciate your time is their own
[01:40:17.500 --> 01:40:21.500]  hubris that they they think that they can get away with anything and that
[01:40:21.500 --> 01:40:27.100]  they're going to start a war with the wrong group or or or or engage in too
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:32.580]  many Ponzi bets I mean take 888 we now know from DC insiders that came out in
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:38.060]  New Yorker magazine that Cheney basically with NATO tried to test Russia and
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:42.220]  see if they could push into South Ossetia and Eucasia and the Russians rolled
[01:40:42.220 --> 01:40:46.100]  in missiles the their chairman of their joint chiefs of staff it was on European
[01:40:46.100 --> 01:40:50.180]  TV but not here as we're kept in the dark and said okay we're going to use
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:54.020]  nuclear weapons on the NATO forces landing in southern Georgia and the
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:58.180]  United States in NATO blinked and pulled back but it shows that if we're
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:04.540]  being run by a bunch of craven old men with bionic hearts who are so so
[01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:08.980]  unstable that they would mess with Russia just to see what would happen I
[01:41:08.980 --> 01:41:14.900]  mean I think we're all in just incredible danger of cataclysms because of
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:20.060]  these people yeah I think it's a corrupt and pretty rotten elite which is
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:24.300]  probably more fragile than we suspect I think you're right to point out the
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:31.420]  closure of the 18 encampments all done simultaneously and coordinated because
[01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:36.660]  that exposed what they have to offer which is essentially force instead of
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:40.700]  responding to the legitimate demands that push people into those encampments
[01:41:40.700 --> 01:41:47.500]  they try to physically erase them and instead of addressing the foreclosures
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:52.300]  and bank repossessions the massive unemployment the staggering student
[01:41:52.300 --> 01:41:57.300]  debt they think they can wipe these encampments and the problem will go away
[01:41:57.300 --> 01:42:02.060]  and I think that's a window into how calcified and out of touch they are yeah
[01:42:02.060 --> 01:42:05.980]  and instead it's probably gonna cause a violent revolution which which which as
[01:42:05.980 --> 01:42:10.220]  you know usually doesn't go too well in history and I want to try to avoid is
[01:42:10.220 --> 01:42:14.940]  there any way in your view to navigate out of this well you know I spent a lot
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:18.660]  of time with the Occupy movement because as a somebody who spent 20 years as a
[01:42:18.660 --> 01:42:23.140]  work correspondent I know the poison of violence I know what it does you know
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:31.220]  even what it's used in a stensibly just cause I I think that we've we have to
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:35.300]  push as hard as we can I think the state will push back they're clearly already
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:42.540]  are pushing back but when legitimate forms of dissent are crushed you right
[01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:46.300]  you know that you inevitably get a violent response I hope we don't get
[01:42:46.300 --> 01:42:50.220]  there and I was arrested in front of Goldman Sachs as part of an Occupy
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:54.820]  demonstration because I think civil disobedience is is at this point the
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:43:00.700]  only weapon that perhaps can support this slide into what the political
[01:43:00.700 --> 01:43:05.660]  philosopher Sheldon woolen calls our system of inverted totalitarianism
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:11.300]  Wow well thank you Chris for your time and people can find the latest book well
[01:43:11.300 --> 01:43:14.380]  the one you're saying is most important right now death of liberal class 2010
[01:43:14.380 --> 01:43:19.580]  also the world as it is thank you so much for your time thanks for having me
[01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:25.460]  thank you well he certainly got a lot of courage he is suing Obama for NDAA and
[01:43:25.460 --> 01:43:30.260]  again the system always tries to make it either or and it's in that nuance that
[01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:34.580]  people get confused the system knew that there were all these people
[01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:39.380]  disenfranchised in fact what was it 15 suicides or something in the last three
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:44.140]  days in Morocco people setting themselves on fire because there's millions
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:49.540]  of people who can't get jobs these aren't lazy people setting themselves on
[01:43:49.540 --> 01:43:54.180]  fire in Morocco I was reading where the Greeks are putting their kids out on
[01:43:54.180 --> 01:43:58.580]  the streets because they can't feed them and their and and and thousands of
[01:43:58.580 --> 01:44:02.900]  Greek islands they have thousands of islands are being handed over some of
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:06.780]  more billions of peace to private brokerage firm heads for debt that
[01:44:06.780 --> 01:44:10.360]  Greece signed on to because because because the fraudsters sold them
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:15.380]  derivatives and there's the latest it's it's it's it's they're kind of doling
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:18.740]  them out as they happen that's Moroccan dies after setting himself on fire I
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:24.220]  guess that's the latest who died so all of this is happening but then you'll
[01:44:24.220 --> 01:44:28.940]  hear me criticizing Occupy Wall Street no no no the system knows that there's
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:32.340]  people they've got computerized actuaries they know there's already
[01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:36.060]  demonstrations forming everywhere I mean we could predict the Tea Party you
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:39.940]  know years before it happened Gerald Salente could you could see these trends
[01:44:39.940 --> 01:44:43.500]  well they've got computers that do it off of what people are actually writing
[01:44:43.500 --> 01:44:49.500]  and saying and doing these computers thin slice giant sections of data and you
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:52.900]  know come up with incredibly accurate projections and so they just put out an
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:56.380]  announcement everybody who's mad at Wall Street corruption and bailouts show
[01:44:56.380 --> 01:45:00.380]  up here so you get liberals conservatives libertarians anarchists
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.140]  they're all down there and then in comes Soros and the White House controlled
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:09.340]  people and they try to go yes the answer is raised taxes on the middle class
[01:45:09.340 --> 01:45:14.300]  and Warren Buffett comes out and endorses it and says that's right do what
[01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:19.060]  they say because he's written the tax laws where he's exempt so has meant
[01:45:19.060 --> 01:45:25.220]  Romney again you're taught it's either rich guys or poor people no no no normal
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:30.660]  middle-class folks worth a million bucks five million of 300,000 whatever it is
[01:45:30.660 --> 01:45:35.100]  that whole strata that's who actually gets their haircut buys clothes goes to a
[01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:40.900]  golf course puts their kid in college but you know buys electronics goes to your
[01:45:40.900 --> 01:45:44.940]  restaurant that's the bigger the middle class the more prosperous because
[01:45:44.940 --> 01:45:48.980]  people in the working class can then get into that class and it swells but the
[01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:53.060]  bigger the middle class always the freer society and the tinier the elite and
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:57.100]  the fact that they can't monopolize control and they don't like that they
[01:45:57.100 --> 01:46:02.460]  want to be in charge and just as Chris Hedges said this isn't even
[01:46:02.460 --> 01:46:06.940]  capitalism see the occupy people with the George Soros signs that trucks were
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:10.340]  pulling up on record handing out you know fake signs that look like they were
[01:46:10.340 --> 01:46:16.420]  homemade was in capitalism in the free market the capitalism didn't do this
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:22.740]  this isn't capitalism where six banks run the government and steal 27 trillion
[01:46:22.740 --> 01:46:27.660]  and buy up the media with it and then and and and then we've got to bail them
[01:46:27.660 --> 01:46:33.740]  out and then they loan us our money back and then lecture us I mean I'll see
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:43.140]  Larry Summers and I'll see Geithner and I'll see Clinton and I'll see all the
[01:46:43.140 --> 01:46:48.100]  people that engineered the end of Glass-Steagall and boy they sort of get
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:51.300]  the military for martial law the minute they did because they knew where this
[01:46:51.300 --> 01:46:54.700]  was going you build a bubble like that that's an awesome thing to do and when
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:58.500]  it pops look out well they're gonna out of that chaos they get power as it
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:03.300]  pumps up but they get the real power when it implodes and I was reading the
[01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:08.980]  people at the Davos event this morning John Bown printed it off for me and I
[01:47:08.980 --> 01:47:14.380]  mean it's the Rothschilds the Rockefellers the royalty the you know all
[01:47:14.380 --> 01:47:18.780]  of the elites come like a public builder Berg meeting and they come out and say
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:23.580]  we're here to have a new capitalism where we're gonna raise taxes to help the
[01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:27.180]  poor we're gonna get the rich people they have all these rich guys show up
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:35.100]  there and say I only pay 4% tax that's not fair I only pay 2% I only pay 10 well
[01:47:35.100 --> 01:47:40.100]  Mitt Romney pays 15 you know that's not right you know what we've always been
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:43.860]  totally greedy and will destroy your companies to consolidate them but now we
[01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:49.860]  care raise the taxes and then you actually see the tax plan it cuts the
[01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:54.500]  taxes for the elite who already pay almost no tax it says oh we're just
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:58.180]  gonna give you a tax holiday you can bring back your your 18 trillion back
[01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:02.340]  into the United States out of the Cayman Islands tax-free that'll oh yeah
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:07.660]  let's cut your taxes to zero because most of the money's bailout money you
[01:48:07.660 --> 01:48:13.060]  already got and you'll never hear this from a neocon talk show host because
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:20.100]  they're owned by these people instead the neocons will fight the controlled opposition
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:23.860]  left calling for socialism and communism and into capitalism but who's
[01:48:23.860 --> 01:48:28.900]  financing it the very same big bankers to then have the the the the the blue
[01:48:28.900 --> 01:48:34.300]  collar public and the welfare class under them attack what's left of the
[01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:37.820]  middle class and the globalists are offshore exempt from all of it in a big
[01:48:37.820 --> 01:48:41.900]  joke and then now the system's pushing pushing pushing pushing for armed
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:45.940]  conflict with the American people train the military train the police trying to
[01:48:45.940 --> 01:48:50.020]  get a civil war going and again they're all gonna sit offshore while we all kill
[01:48:50.020 --> 01:48:56.620]  each other now I know all these vets and people out there who publicly say when
[01:48:56.620 --> 01:49:01.500]  this all goes down look out police and military that come after us you know what
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:05.660]  that makes my heart hurt sure I don't like some arrogant Roy head cop that
[01:49:05.660 --> 01:49:09.220]  likes to beat people up or you know some military person that's dumb enough to go
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.980]  up against domestic ribs but I know they're gonna be following some brain
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:19.020]  washing template some some cover story and I care about them I'm not I'm
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:23.820]  beyond macho folks I'm beyond tough guy to the point of I don't want to go there
[01:49:23.820 --> 01:49:28.660]  I want to defeat the actual controllers I'm not all I'll just have a war with
[01:49:28.660 --> 01:49:33.260]  the little with the with the local cops local cops are just like your neighbor
[01:49:33.260 --> 01:49:37.660]  just like the general public they have no idea what's going on we've got to
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:41.460]  instead of just buying guns which I do thinks a good backup we got to defend
[01:49:41.460 --> 01:49:44.380]  ourselves let's not make a mistake about that but it's but if you're to the
[01:49:44.380 --> 01:49:48.020]  point of buying a bunch of guns getting ready for war and just just ready there
[01:49:48.020 --> 01:49:50.500]  are a lot of folks I want to warn the police and military as you know who
[01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:54.380]  want to die who don't care I mean if you think their restraint is because they're
[01:49:54.380 --> 01:49:58.340]  afraid of you and your black uniforms scare them it's the opposite it enrages
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:03.100]  real men who are real men but aren't sophisticated enough to understand all

[01:50:08.140 --> 01:50:12.300]  in your position with what the new world order is trying to push you into so if a
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:15.780]  lot of people are talking about war with the government why don't you engage in

[01:50:20.980 --> 01:50:25.940]  streets blood in the streets why don't we try to point out capitalism didn't do

[01:50:39.460 --> 01:50:43.700]  this up and selling socialism as the solution to what they've done because
[01:50:43.700 --> 01:50:46.820]  it creates command and control economies that shuts down all their
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:54.300]  competition it is so essential to get that message of truth out or the cops

[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:20.860]  up at info wars.com and prison planet.com Soros mouthpiece calls on
[01:54:20.860 --> 01:54:28.060]  Google to police conspiracy theorist and it's not just Cass Sunstein but
[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:32.980]  Stanford scholar wants search engines to flag global warming vaccine
[01:54:32.980 --> 01:54:37.980]  skepticism as thought crime now you've heard me play an AP video at the start
[01:54:37.980 --> 01:54:43.220]  of the hour where they actually say the latest pre-crime system and you're not
[01:54:43.220 --> 01:54:51.460]  watching minority report they're actually saying it's pre-crime and saying how
[01:54:51.460 --> 01:54:55.900]  great it is and then it reads through here and they're writing articles for
[01:54:55.900 --> 01:55:01.540]  Slate there's White House announcements Cass Sunstein they're openly talking
[01:55:01.540 --> 01:55:06.980]  about shutting down websites and then arresting people I mean these are
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:11.340]  authoritarians I mean that there's there's no if-hands or buts and then you
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:16.460]  got Limbaugh saying well Ron Paul deserves to be stopped by TSA he's a
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:23.100]  Muslim terrorist I mean what and it's not funny I'm not gonna put up with you
[01:55:23.100 --> 01:55:30.620]  globalist traders claiming we're the traders I'm sick of it now speaking this
[01:55:30.620 --> 01:55:34.740]  is weird I've seen this five six seven years ago about six months ago I just
[01:55:34.740 --> 01:55:41.380]  typed in the YouTube George Soros 60 minutes interview and you would get I'm
[01:55:41.380 --> 01:55:46.860]  not joking dozens and dozens page after page of him on 60 minutes things about
[01:55:46.860 --> 01:55:53.740]  1999 or 2000 actually have the date here in 1998 interview with with with the
[01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:57.900]  Steve Croft where he talked about how great it was working for the Nazis and
[01:55:57.900 --> 01:56:04.260]  he doesn't feel bad about it he must have had all of that expunged off of the
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:08.140]  web when Glenn Beck talked about earlier in the year copying our show
[01:56:08.140 --> 01:56:12.020]  talking about it which is fine I'm glad it's like an auxiliary of my broadcast
[01:56:12.020 --> 01:56:16.100]  I'm very proud of it actually I am if we come up with a new special on the
[01:56:16.100 --> 01:56:19.820]  website he copies it exactly the truth lives there always said the truth lived
[01:56:19.820 --> 01:56:23.140]  here you know give the gift of truth at Christmas he gives the gift of truth I
[01:56:23.140 --> 01:56:27.660]  love it I mean I'm it's like a clone but like a little twisted clone but he's
[01:56:27.660 --> 01:56:33.620]  getting closer to me so that's good good to see my son coming along but here's
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:37.380]  from the Zionist Organization of America it's troubling to see the Jewish
[01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:40.540]  leaders defend Israel
[01:56:40.540 --> 01:56:46.660]  U.S. Basher again it's troubling to see Jewish leaders defend Israel U.S. Basher
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:49.780]  George Soros against Glenn Beck's criticism and then they actually have
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:58.540]  the transcript here of George Soros talking about working for the Nazis and
[01:56:58.540 --> 01:57:01.340]  I'm gonna go over this transcript and everything tonight but here's the deal
[01:57:01.340 --> 01:57:05.700]  we're getting hundreds of emails nobody else can find it now it's been removed
[01:57:05.700 --> 01:57:10.940]  from the bit Torrance it's been removed from YouTube Google video it's been
[01:57:10.940 --> 01:57:19.620]  removed everywhere if you find it you need to save it and it's from 1998 I
[01:57:19.620 --> 01:57:24.660]  played clips of this years ago 1998 interview that's what we're thinking
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:31.740]  about Glenn Beck December 20th 1998 Steve Croft funny thing is used to I'd
[01:57:31.740 --> 01:57:36.900]  like play a clip of a eugenicist you know calling for world population reduction
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:42.460]  and then a month later here on Becky poo but I mean I'm glad of that but I guess
[01:57:42.460 --> 01:57:47.060]  when Beck covered it his show was so big then that they they just had it removed
[01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:53.420]  so because I mean that was like coffin nails to George Soros absolute coffin
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:57.420]  nails and of course George Soros's media matters is routinely demonizing us and
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:01.420]  attacking us on pretty much a daily basis by the way Warren Buffett the rich
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:05.820]  guy that openly wants to raise taxes on the middle class to pay it to himself and
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:09.380]  make her bailouts Bloomberg is reporting that Warren Buffett's
[01:58:09.380 --> 01:58:14.780]  Burlington Northern among winners from Keystone denial when they shut down that
[01:58:14.780 --> 01:58:19.780]  pipeline it'll now be taken by train to the US but also to the west coast of
[01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:26.540]  Canada to be put on tankers to China and Bloomberg reports so see the big guys
[01:58:26.540 --> 01:58:30.420]  make their money off government shutting down their competition that's why
[01:58:30.420 --> 01:58:35.740]  John D. Rockefeller the first said competition is a sin but the neocon
[01:58:35.740 --> 01:58:44.700]  talk show host will never tell you that dirty secret you are listening to GCN

[01:59:10.140 --> 01:59:15.420]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:27.500]  crazy news I've got I haven't gotten to yet Mitt Romney's release warms
[02:01:27.500 --> 02:01:32.180]  financials he basically doesn't pay taxes it's all in offshore banks but if you
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:36.500]  make it $200,000 a year try to save a hundred thousand of that and put it in
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:40.300]  offshore accounts even after tax they're gonna take it they've made it almost
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:44.740]  impossible to get it out they'll have the IRS rule it's fraud outside of law and
[02:01:44.740 --> 02:01:50.340]  take whatever you got only if you're a big globalist and are in the special
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:55.540]  club are you allowed to do this see because we live in a two-tiered system
[02:01:55.540 --> 02:01:59.980]  now but the globalist can commit any crime they want any time they want they
[02:01:59.980 --> 02:02:04.420]  have globalist immunity they basically have new world order immunity from laws
[02:02:04.420 --> 02:02:08.660]  and it's the same thing in the European Union they get away with whatever they
[02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:14.500]  want whenever they want they're getting closer and closer to that that system
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:18.100]  that Nick Rockefeller talked about where the elite basically has a microchip in
[02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:22.420]  the body the inside their body where no one can challenge him no one can ask
[02:02:22.420 --> 02:02:26.620]  them questions the police cannot touch them they are immune and they can just
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:30.540]  commit any crime they want and get away with anything they want and if you dare
[02:02:30.540 --> 02:02:34.180]  try to protest against them the police will come and splits your head open and
[02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:37.820]  the police will have their future destroyed their children's future
[02:02:37.820 --> 02:02:42.940]  destroyed and the global eugenesis control freaks will continue to do
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:46.940]  whatever they want to the environment put sodium fluoride in the water vaccines
[02:02:46.940 --> 02:02:51.300]  will be poisoned and they'll write white papers on how they're doing it to us but
[02:02:51.300 --> 02:02:55.580]  because the general public is only talking about the NFL playoffs I was
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:59.180]  listening to the radio yesterday and you could hear the talking point of you
[02:02:59.180 --> 02:03:04.220]  know talking about the Giants I guess are going to the playoff super bowl
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:07.900]  something I don't know I don't even know where the playoffs are what's going on
[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:12.500]  with it I'm too concerned with the Strait of Hormuz the Iranians say they're
[02:03:12.500 --> 02:03:17.700]  getting ready to shut it the US says they're gonna attack them oil prices go
[02:03:17.700 --> 02:03:22.740]  up economy sputters even more we go into deeper depression larger war could
[02:03:22.740 --> 02:03:29.940]  begin but again I'm the bad person cuz I hear these men on the radio they're
[02:03:29.940 --> 02:03:36.420]  just like oh it's so great the Giants oh man they're my team oh yeah you know my
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:39.380]  wife didn't used to like football but she came out of the room and she said you
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:43.940]  know I really like it now and you know I like to watch football by myself and
[02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:48.500]  pace up and down and yell the TV and my kids just come in quietly and look at
[02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:54.620]  me and all the other host is like yeah I know what you mean it's so manly
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:58.660]  meanwhile I'm pacing up and down trying to figure out how to wake people up I'm
[02:03:58.660 --> 02:04:03.020]  pacing up and down not believing how hardcore the tyranny is I'm pacing up
[02:04:03.020 --> 02:04:08.940]  and down confirming that in the H1N1 shot they added another virus that's a
[02:04:08.940 --> 02:04:14.180]  carrier and appears to be some type of binary weapon and it's just killing
[02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.660]  people and maiming people and the numbers are coming in and the cancer is
[02:04:17.660 --> 02:04:22.100]  exploding and the death but I hear these men who are like in this mesmerized
[02:04:22.100 --> 02:04:27.460]  cult brainwash haze you know trying to impress each other with how much they

[02:08:11.420 --> 02:08:31.940]  radio network. Ladies and gentlemen the news is just pouring in I'm gonna go to
[02:08:31.940 --> 02:08:35.940]  your phone calls and then more news but later in the day Aaron Dykes is gonna
[02:08:35.940 --> 02:08:40.460]  have a special report a tax report like this is so big I think I'll shoot a
[02:08:40.460 --> 02:08:50.220]  video for it too out on info wars.com where there's a new congressional
[02:08:50.220 --> 02:08:55.460]  report with the Cherdolph group the folks that gave you the naked body
[02:08:55.460 --> 02:08:59.940]  scanners where they basically admit everything that we've already reverse
[02:08:59.940 --> 02:09:04.780]  engineered but it's the admissions you know we told you TSA would be on the
[02:09:04.780 --> 02:09:08.620]  streets of America there'd be naked body scanners everywhere shopping malls
[02:09:08.620 --> 02:09:12.740]  highway checkpoints that's why they've got to break your will and do it in the
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:19.260]  airport to set that precedent they've got to do it there they've got to have
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:23.580]  federal funds for mobile trucks to take blood forcibly they've got to get the
[02:09:23.580 --> 02:09:27.660]  police ready to give force inoculations so they've got to medicalize the police
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:33.060]  for medical tyranny as their little enforcers but they want a federal kind
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:40.900]  of brown shirt minimum wage force and that's what the TSA is I know they're
[02:09:40.900 --> 02:09:43.660]  a little bit more than minimum wage but compared to police and others you know
[02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:48.740]  it's a lot lower who don't even come out of the old systems of the Bill of
[02:09:48.740 --> 02:09:55.100]  Rights and Constitution that's been a bridge to a great extent but now they're
[02:09:55.100 --> 02:10:00.500]  just doing away with it in its entirety by creating a new agency and ten years
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:07.140]  into this you see the tyranny bureaucratic arbitrary constant lying to the
[02:10:07.140 --> 02:10:13.540]  public their enemy the incredible power trips and the document he was just
[02:10:13.540 --> 02:10:17.780]  showing me during the break was homeland security will hire everybody in
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:20.500]  America he let to get their approval for a job we already knew that from the
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:24.820]  hearings here's going c-span but here it is in a document there'll be check
[02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:29.340]  points everywhere homeland security with private contractors so that you know
[02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:34.900]  the establishment types make money will hire your local police you'll have to
[02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:38.500]  get homeland security approval even higher police they'll be totally
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:43.300]  federalized and they admit they're going to respond to all crime you'll have
[02:10:43.300 --> 02:10:48.100]  federal police at every city targeting the American people and it has no
[02:10:48.100 --> 02:10:51.900]  pretense that it's for terrorists it's just total federalization of
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:58.900]  everything by wicked sickening goon forces and he was just showing me these
[02:10:58.900 --> 02:11:05.100]  documents and it's all in Congress and it is the military industrial complex
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:11.540]  basically absorbing all of America and the the biggest group of new in the last
[02:11:11.540 --> 02:11:16.900]  decade scholarships is every facet of spying and running the systems and data
[02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:22.500]  mining and grids and psychology degrees on how to break the American people's
[02:11:22.500 --> 02:11:27.340]  will I mean using our money just building a giant army of scum and

[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:50.900]  for last week California passed a law to forcibly inoculate children without
[02:11:50.900 --> 02:11:55.500]  primal consent I mean it's all happening you know legislation to shut down free

[02:24:06.660 --> 02:24:10.540]  get into the other news I haven't covered like this I had this on Sunday at
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:15.900]  infowars.com but I didn't cover them on radio Atlanta Jewish Times publisher
[02:24:15.900 --> 02:24:22.700]  steps down over Obama hit column CBS News reports out of Atlanta I'm gonna
[02:24:22.700 --> 02:24:26.820]  comment on this coming up but but the fact that he would openly talk like
[02:24:26.820 --> 02:24:32.820]  that shows just the complete arrogance that if Obama didn't attack Iran he
[02:24:32.820 --> 02:24:38.420]  needs to be dealt with and that just shows people buying propaganda Obama is
[02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:44.180]  attacking Iran inside Obama is a new world order warmonger it just shows the
[02:24:44.180 --> 02:24:50.220]  complete false reality people live in I mean this guy should be arrested I'll
[02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:54.180]  guarantee you if I came on air and said you know get the president use those
[02:24:54.180 --> 02:24:58.780]  words they would come after me it's just totally sick but again the president
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:04.060]  runs nothing Mike in Texas you're not on the air welcome
[02:25:04.060 --> 02:25:09.820]  hello hey buddy hello how you doing good yes I want to tell you I think the
[02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:14.420]  people missing the point you're telling them every day and what they don't
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:18.140]  understand is the law is not the law anymore it's controlled the law of the
[02:25:18.140 --> 02:25:21.860]  law in the past but now they're using as a control grid like you said that we
[02:25:21.860 --> 02:25:27.380]  understood that our law is law but it's not they're using law as a control thing
[02:25:27.380 --> 02:25:32.860]  yes the government is illegitimate now and a joke and authoritarian and they
[02:25:32.860 --> 02:25:37.700]  admit they are and they're arrogant and crazy and dangerous as it gets and are
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:41.900]  bringing us into collapse and I'm jumping up and down screaming and yelling
[02:25:41.900 --> 02:25:45.980]  because it's freaking me out and I'm concerned I'm not scared but I'm
[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:51.740]  energetic and and jumping up and down trying to get people to be concerned to
[02:25:51.740 --> 02:25:55.260]  be like if there was a bunch of fires coming and burning down the city and
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:58.700]  nobody seemed to care and was walking around like zombies while houses are
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:02.700]  burning down around them it's very frustrating go ahead sorry yeah and
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:05.860]  also I want to tell you also I've been looking at what you're saying about all
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:11.420]  these vaccines like my health is not that good I can't be taking a vaccine with
[02:26:11.420 --> 02:26:15.020]  my kidneys you know not working too good so I went to Lone Star College here in
[02:26:15.020 --> 02:26:19.900]  Houston Texas they're also on the grid they set up the grid here because they
[02:26:19.900 --> 02:26:25.540]  sit in street lights I'm in camera in neighborhoods and also the college is
[02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:28.740]  let you attend unless you take a meningitis vaccine and I think that's
[02:26:28.740 --> 02:26:32.860]  not right because meningitis is a very dangerous virus and to be pushing that
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:36.580]  vaccine with us not knowing what's in it I think that's not by the way you're
[02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:41.060]  right the meningitis vaccine is one of the most dangerous and meningitis is
[02:26:41.060 --> 02:26:44.100]  incredibly rare and the vaccine they give you in most cases doesn't even
[02:26:44.100 --> 02:26:49.540]  protect you from the type that's coming in and it's not even really the law that
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:53.060]  you have to do that it's a fraud and look until three years ago they told
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:56.380]  people with kidney trouble or who were pregnant or a whole other list not to
[02:26:56.380 --> 02:27:00.660]  take vaccines now they tell women if you're pregnant take it even more and
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:05.340]  then it kills the baby in many cases that's what I mean it's gotten crazy
[02:27:05.340 --> 02:27:10.540]  the special interest said no it's gonna kill a bunch of women and to form their
[02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:15.060]  babies if it doesn't kill them and they say go ahead with it and I remember the
[02:27:15.060 --> 02:27:20.300]  Houston police chief five years ago called for cameras in people's homes I
[02:27:20.300 --> 02:27:24.460]  mean what did you think of that did you hear that AP video where they were
[02:27:24.460 --> 02:27:28.700]  saying how great it is to have pre-crime now and that you're a criminal
[02:27:28.700 --> 02:27:32.820]  beforehand because they say so I was looking at that I don't like that that
[02:27:32.820 --> 02:27:37.260]  that right there should be a showstopper for people to like wake up you know and
[02:27:37.260 --> 02:27:40.620]  they're trying to make you a pre-criminal and that says the president like you
[02:27:40.620 --> 02:27:44.340]  said I think it's just I think you're trying to set so many presidents to put
[02:27:44.340 --> 02:27:48.100]  people in jail because if you get us all in jail on any little charge they could
[02:27:48.100 --> 02:27:51.980]  all of a sudden just switch it you know hit a switch and start sending us to
[02:27:51.980 --> 02:27:56.540]  FEMA camps and start an hour late now race so we need to stand together and I
[02:27:56.540 --> 02:28:00.060]  think all the Christians and people that believe in God need to send a letter to
[02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:04.980]  the White House right now today and get all your church groups and church
[02:28:04.980 --> 02:28:08.860]  members to go against the evil that's in our country right now we are being
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:14.300]  taken over by Satan himself we need to start standing up together and getting
[02:28:14.300 --> 02:28:18.180]  everybody I'll tell you what it is here you're absolutely right I I've always
[02:28:18.180 --> 02:28:23.220]  known this was coming the day I went to an urban warfare drill in 1998 and saw
[02:28:23.220 --> 02:28:26.940]  troops trying to take our guns and put us in camps and they were admitting that
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:31.900]  that's when I started really turn into the Alex Jones I am the day because
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:35.580]  before that I was main you just a mainline libertarian like Ron Paul and
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:41.180]  you audit the Fed stuff like that and so I've known this was coming and now
[02:28:41.180 --> 02:28:47.820]  we're getting close but eat but but as it's confirmed Mike as it becomes real
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:52.380]  it's freaking me out I mean they're really gonna do all this they're really
[02:28:52.380 --> 02:28:56.540]  gonna stage domestic terror attacks and blame it on people and probably try to
[02:28:56.540 --> 02:29:00.900]  come arrest me and my family and I'm not trying to scare people folks I think
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:05.260]  people got to have courage I mean these are bad criminals and people like well
[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:09.140]  I'm just gonna go along with it look at how the economy shutting down they're
[02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:12.740]  bringing tyranny in because they know people are gonna get mad when everybody
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:17.300]  becomes incredibly poor and I mean to the point of starving to death you know
[02:29:17.300 --> 02:29:21.780]  they talk about shutting America down look at how they shut down that pipeline
[02:29:21.780 --> 02:29:25.060]  are gonna send the oil to China look at how they pay companies to leave the
[02:29:25.060 --> 02:29:30.020]  United States I mean the globalist hate America they've got really bad stuff in
[02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:33.700]  store for us they're trained in the military to secretly arrest and torture
[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:39.500]  I mean they're trying to turn the military into into demons and because
[02:29:39.500 --> 02:29:43.140]  that's not successful they're training foreign troops now God bless you good to

[02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:12.140]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:31:12.140 --> 02:31:16.020]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:31:16.020 --> 02:31:20.540]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:31:20.540 --> 02:31:24.820]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:31:24.820 --> 02:31:28.980]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:31:28.980 --> 02:31:33.300]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:31:33.300 --> 02:31:36.980]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:38.960]  didn't cover quite a bit of it earlier I want to recap a few of the top stories
[02:33:38.960 --> 02:33:44.800]  but get to the other stacks here at least briefly each piece of news separately
[02:33:44.800 --> 02:33:49.420]  if you're a radio listener you probably don't really see what I look like but if
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:54.280]  you go to infowars.com there is a button up at the top that says you know

[02:33:59.040 --> 02:34:04.120]  afford to have the whole show live and free it's costing us like $12,000 more
[02:34:04.120 --> 02:34:07.680]  a month just to have a little 20-minute thing free once a day we're gonna try to
[02:34:07.680 --> 02:34:12.280]  we're working on some cheaper bandwidth to have it always you know the daytime
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:17.880]  show free up there the video and then a higher higher resolution one at
[02:34:17.880 --> 02:34:21.740]  presentplanet.tv for members and the nighttime show for subscribers the
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:26.320]  nightly news and then there's always a link under it for the free audio stream
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:34.360]  and the podcast as well but the point I'm making here is that if you can look
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:40.120]  at me you can see that I have lost a lot of weight I have now lost depending on
[02:34:40.120 --> 02:34:48.000]  which scale I use 37 pounds 37 pounds and we're gonna do some before and
[02:34:48.000 --> 02:34:52.600]  after photos soon I've just been too busy to show it you know to actually put a
[02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:59.240]  commercial together showing it but I'm going to lose another 23 25 pounds or
[02:34:59.240 --> 02:35:13.560]  so I'm going down from 260 down to about 180 and quite frankly I'm just jogging
[02:35:13.560 --> 02:35:17.440]  I've done that before and it didn't work because I was always hungry but because
[02:35:17.440 --> 02:35:21.200]  I did research the last year only put this into effect the last two months I
[02:35:21.200 --> 02:35:29.080]  found that it's mineral and vitamin and trace element deficiency in the food in
[02:35:29.080 --> 02:35:37.560]  the depleted soils that the animals are eating crops from and that we're eating
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:43.360]  crops from and more importantly the sodium fluoride and the other things
[02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:46.720]  that they put the hundreds of chemicals they put in the drinking water those
[02:35:46.720 --> 02:35:51.800]  even though I try to avoid it I still get it at restaurants and places and it
[02:35:51.800 --> 02:35:55.720]  also gets into the food chain itself those fill up your organs and your
[02:35:55.720 --> 02:36:00.520]  thyroid and your glands full of bad stuff the globalists have chosen all the
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:04.640]  things they put in the water to poison your glands there I mean they know seven
[02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:08.600]  fold increase in bone cancer IQ reduction they know hyperthyroidism
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:14.120]  epidemic I mean there's a reason we lead the world in all these diseases I mean
[02:36:14.120 --> 02:36:18.880]  the globalist hate our guts they don't just hate Iraqis they hate us even more
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:21.960]  but they know how to soft kill us they're just getting ready to use the
[02:36:21.960 --> 02:36:26.080]  military on us now and wrap the American flag in it a lot of good old boys
[02:36:26.080 --> 02:36:30.720]  folks would beat a baby's brains out of you said America you know wrap the
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:35.240]  killing in the flag it's just a mindlessness where if you said NFL they
[02:36:35.240 --> 02:36:39.800]  just slipped their kids throat NFL I'm tough I'm a man I mean it's just like
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:45.120]  that's all that matters American flag NFL you could if Satan came out wearing a
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:49.560]  cloak of the American flag they would throw Jesus overboard off a ship and
[02:36:49.560 --> 02:36:54.000]  just bow down and just start worshiping I mean if they said go to are you ready
[02:36:54.000 --> 02:36:57.560]  to die and go to Hades they would say yes as long as there's American flags as
[02:36:57.560 --> 02:37:02.880]  long as the flames look like American flags burning me like Marilyn Monroe
[02:37:02.880 --> 02:37:05.760]  when she's standing out there on top of that great with that wind blowing up you
[02:37:05.760 --> 02:37:11.400]  know as long as it's like American flag flames shooting up they're ready I mean
[02:37:11.400 --> 02:37:14.880]  you could burn the Bellarites Constitution in a pit they bow down to it as
[02:37:14.880 --> 02:37:19.440]  long as the American flag said so you see they don't know what patriotism
[02:37:19.440 --> 02:37:23.440]  liberty and freedom is they just they just get off on feeling like they're
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:27.520]  part of the power structure they watch drones fly over and they think those are
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:32.680]  my drones and they sit around and watch shock and awe as buildings blow up full
[02:37:32.680 --> 02:37:37.120]  of families in them and they feel manly I've actually seen it with family and
[02:37:37.120 --> 02:37:42.080]  people they're just like oh look at that killer you know they'll watch the

[02:41:02.920 --> 02:41:09.240]  welcome. Hi Alex how you doing today? Oh I'm ranting like a madman mad for liberty
[02:41:09.240 --> 02:41:14.400]  go ahead. I'm loving your ranting Alex you are always awesome on the ranting
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:21.480]  I had stage 4 colon cancer about a year and a half ago and the doctors told me
[02:41:21.480 --> 02:41:25.720]  I only had six months to a year left to live without their treatment maybe two
[02:41:25.720 --> 02:41:28.880]  to three years to live with their treatment which meant they were never
[02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:33.840]  going to be able to cure me and some friends of mine on Facebook told me to
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:39.480]  watch this documentary called the beautiful truth and I bought the Gerson
[02:41:39.480 --> 02:41:45.040]  therapy book and a juicer from Costco and also did run from the cure from Rick
[02:41:45.040 --> 02:41:53.800]  Stimson which is basically hash oil and I was able to cure myself in four months.
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:57.480]  Well they're doing everything they can to keep you from getting that hash oil I
[02:41:57.480 --> 02:42:03.000]  know and yes a lot of cancers it's been proven with just the diet cutting out
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:09.120]  the things that grow cancer the the alkalinity of the water the system knows
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:13.760]  that and now they they admit that actually in most cases chemotherapy kills
[02:42:13.760 --> 02:42:18.120]  you it's just if your body can beat both well then you know that's basically
[02:42:18.120 --> 02:42:23.680]  what happens and colon cancer and other cancers of the gut is like getting the
[02:42:23.680 --> 02:42:30.960]  flu now in the last two years three people in my office their girlfriends
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:35.520]  or family members young people have gotten colon cancer and then start the
[02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:39.120]  radiation all the rest of in the course it never really helps them and yeah it's
[02:42:39.120 --> 02:42:42.960]  just it just cancer everywhere 50 years ago the scientists would travel the
[02:42:42.960 --> 02:42:46.480]  world over to see a child with cancer now I go to the mall it's just kids with
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:50.360]  cancer everywhere and because I mean the new world order is hitting us hard and
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:54.800]  loving it all the way to the bank you pay for it you pay to murder your
[02:42:54.800 --> 02:42:57.680]  children with all of it and now if you try to get away from their chemotherapy
[02:42:57.680 --> 02:43:01.200]  with your kids they just come and take them and murder them and it's just all
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:05.840]  part of the murder enjoyment and and again they've just tested the soft
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:09.440]  killing of us and so now which is gonna get more and more wild more and more
[02:43:09.440 --> 02:43:13.440]  crazy no no like never ask why do we have the highest breast cancer in the
[02:43:13.440 --> 02:43:18.000]  world and it's exploding never find out it's bisphenol a and the GMO from the
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:22.280]  same rat studies just just talk about figuring out how to cure it once you get
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:27.080]  it don't ask why everybody's getting it because the little murderers the same
[02:43:27.080 --> 02:43:30.360]  ones that are making the money off the treatments are the ones that gave it to
[02:43:30.360 --> 02:43:34.480]  you they're sickening you Genesis murderers who promise to put stuff in
[02:43:34.480 --> 02:43:37.920]  your water like the White House science are said and they think it's real cute
[02:43:37.920 --> 02:43:41.400]  and they think it's real funny that they're killing everybody out in the
[02:43:41.400 --> 02:43:45.480]  open and nobody wants to stand up against them
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:53.160]  anything else you'd like to add yeah I also bought a atmospheric water
[02:43:53.160 --> 02:43:58.520]  generator so I can get myself off of the the regular water supply and basically
[02:43:58.520 --> 02:44:02.880]  you just plug it in the wall it sucks water into it and produces high alkaline
[02:44:02.880 --> 02:44:09.120]  high pH water also battle cancer cancer beater why why don't you just trust the
[02:44:09.120 --> 02:44:13.360]  government and drink the tap water we do have the highest rates of cancer they
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:18.400]  must they care are you an extremist because the white man other White House
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:22.680]  and Soros people have the article are calling for shutting down the websites
[02:44:22.680 --> 02:44:27.600]  of conspiracy theorists people that don't trust known certified liars they're
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:30.960]  saying if you don't believe known certified liars you should be arrested
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:37.880]  what's wrong with that well I don't trust them as far as you can throw them well I
[02:44:37.880 --> 02:44:40.440]  mean you know that's because you're extreme I mean you're actually thinking
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:48.040]  for yourself I but being serious so so what's happened to the out-of-control
[02:44:48.040 --> 02:44:51.640]  cell growth similar to our government since you started the juicing and
[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:57.400]  things well it's a completely reversed I went from a two-inch golf ball size
[02:44:57.400 --> 02:45:02.280]  tumor and two lip nodes length side of my abdominal area and a bunch of activity
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:07.400]  going out in my lungs to act absolutely clean and clear of cancer now in four
[02:45:07.400 --> 02:45:12.040]  months and what are the doctors saying are they trying to have you arrested or
[02:45:12.040 --> 02:45:16.360]  something forced on treatment absolutely not but neither one of the
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:20.640]  oncologists wanted to know what I did to cure my cancer which in my opinion just
[02:45:20.640 --> 02:45:23.720]  goes to prove that a non-cologist is nothing more than a drug dealing
[02:45:23.720 --> 02:45:28.040]  poison pusher well yeah they get hundreds of thousands of dollars for
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:31.520]  somebody they treat and you're talking about you have three four thousand
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:36.320]  dollars per can of raid most of the chemo is basically just just just rat
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:40.360]  rat poison or roach poison I mean you know that's why they've come out now
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:47.160]  with a you know three thousand dollar a bottle hemp variant that is used to treat
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:52.000]  a bunch of illnesses that was in the news yesterday that guys put it was like
[02:45:52.000 --> 02:45:56.560]  AP company comes out with synthetic marijuana and and you know they've
[02:45:56.560 --> 02:45:59.880]  got a two hundred and fifty dollar bottle of fish oil that should cost ten
[02:45:59.880 --> 02:46:04.080]  dollars that's synthetic and you know that they make money off of and so of
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:08.000]  course they're trying to make it illegal for you to get fish oil for ten
[02:46:08.000 --> 02:46:12.640]  dollars so you have to buy it from them and go to a doctor and I see articles
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:17.080]  where they swat team people now growing aloe vera saying it could be used as a
[02:46:17.080 --> 02:46:21.040]  drug look you're not gonna get aloe vera you're not gonna get fish that's
[02:46:21.040 --> 02:46:26.080]  terrorism I mean you know you got to use heroin shipped in by the US Army I

[02:46:40.000 --> 02:46:44.840]  question and I've got a comment well I guess my comments pretty big I wanted to
[02:46:44.840 --> 02:46:49.040]  say that I mean all this stuff that you're saying about the doctors with
[02:46:49.040 --> 02:46:54.440]  you know big pharma supposedly taking care of everybody it's heavy down here I
[02:46:54.440 --> 02:47:00.800]  mean flu shots for free in some cases down at Walmart or at Walgreens yeah
[02:47:00.800 --> 02:47:08.160]  that's because they care about your Joseph Joseph they care about you they
[02:47:08.160 --> 02:47:13.240]  care about it so much that they got my mom and dad we know completely got their
[02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:19.560]  drawers filled with drugs they've taken my sister's gallbladder out because it
[02:47:19.560 --> 02:47:24.280]  got stones because she's sick from everything she's eating and I've got
[02:47:24.280 --> 02:47:29.080]  ants who have are paralyzed from diseases that have sprung out of nowhere and
[02:47:29.080 --> 02:47:36.240]  all because my family's aesthetic I mean I almost caught cancer in my in my
[02:47:36.240 --> 02:47:40.520]  colon and I thankfully you know how to remove it with a it was a cancerous
[02:47:40.520 --> 02:47:44.600]  all day it found inside me yeah well let me expand on that I should do a report
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:51.280]  on that blacks and Hispanics especially are all being targeted and I mean the
[02:47:51.280 --> 02:47:55.400]  diabetes the cancer rates all of it is off the charts and they've done studies
[02:47:55.400 --> 02:47:59.480]  I've seen where the behavior isn't different but they're getting more HIV
[02:47:59.480 --> 02:48:04.880]  more hepatitis and yes it is the globalist there's no doubt are targeting
[02:48:04.880 --> 02:48:10.280]  people worldwide according to their race and you're absolutely right it's no

[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:27.400]  either they're addicted to smoking cigarettes or addicted to drinking and
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:30.560]  by the way what do they do with cigarettes they put chemicals in them to
[02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:34.320]  make a more addicting and make you smoke more they're doing it with the GMO
[02:48:34.320 --> 02:48:38.360]  they're doing it with all the additives they're doing it they're killing us
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:43.400]  people ate even more calories than they do now 50 years ago on average it's that
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:47.200]  the stuff we're eating is killing us I appreciate your call God bless you sorry

[02:49:01.960 --> 02:49:05.880]  know that's extreme and I'm bad but it's true here's a clip from time bandits I
[02:49:05.880 --> 02:49:14.760]  was mentioning earlier Robert just want your time has come wonderful

[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:24.680]  put everybody's the naked body scanner I mean think about it they have TV shows

[02:50:28.920 --> 02:50:32.240]  somebody's kid to get the answers and it's always the right thing to do it and
[02:50:32.240 --> 02:50:36.320]  in the real world in Abu Ghraib they're torturing kids sexually it comes out and
[02:50:36.320 --> 02:50:41.480]  no one gets in trouble who gave the orders I mean again that's practicing

[02:54:02.640 --> 02:54:17.480]  instance.
[02:54:17.480 --> 02:54:24.080]  Benson I feel the power of evil coursing through my veins filling every corner of
[02:54:24.080 --> 02:54:33.720]  my being with the desire to do wrong. I feel so bad. Yes it is good. Well this is the
[02:54:33.720 --> 02:54:37.760]  worst kind of badness that I'm feeling. Kill me monster. Kill me. Not now Benson we
[02:54:37.760 --> 02:54:43.480]  have worked it out. No lesser work than the overthrowing of creation itself. We
[02:54:43.480 --> 02:54:52.520]  will remake man in our image not his. We will turn mountains into sea. The skies
[02:54:52.520 --> 02:55:01.600]  into rivers.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:05.600]  That's enough. What an excellent movie and that's what the globalists are doing. The
[02:55:05.600 --> 02:55:10.480]  devil wants to genetically engineer screw everything up murder people engage in
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.840]  disease activity and that's what psychopaths and control freaks actually
[02:55:14.840 --> 02:55:19.080]  want. That's what people don't get. They're like why does the new order want
[02:55:19.080 --> 02:55:26.160]  this? Well why does a rattlesnake want to bite you? It's the old story of the
[02:55:26.160 --> 02:55:29.680]  scorpion. He asked the frog to take him across the river. The frog says you'll
[02:55:29.680 --> 02:55:35.520]  you'll sting me and he says no I won't I promise just take me across. So the
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:38.800]  frog's nice he takes him across and when they get the other side the scorpion
[02:55:38.800 --> 02:55:42.320]  stings him and he's laying there dying he says but I took you across why'd you
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:47.680]  sting me and he said because I'm a scorpion silly the Africans have every
[02:55:47.680 --> 02:55:52.240]  culture's got it. They've got one with the cobra where the cobra is hurt and
[02:55:52.240 --> 02:55:55.960]  asked the old man to carry him out of the desert and when he gets the cobra out
[02:55:55.960 --> 02:55:58.920]  of the desert and just some water remember the name the cobra bites him and
[02:55:58.920 --> 02:56:01.960]  kills him and as the old man's dying he says why'd you bite me and he goes I'm
[02:56:01.960 --> 02:56:07.800]  a cobra. I mean the founding fathers explained from history if you let this
[02:56:07.800 --> 02:56:11.880]  happen you will be enslaved and the level of enslavement you live under is the
[02:56:11.880 --> 02:56:18.280]  exact level you put up with Thomas Jefferson said that quote I just gave
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:26.200]  you and they said in the letters back and forth between him and John Adams he
[02:56:26.200 --> 02:56:35.440]  said why and he said because it's a tropism that's what it does that's its
[02:56:35.440 --> 02:56:40.920]  nature. The worst of the worst will get in control and then they'll only be top
[02:56:40.920 --> 02:56:47.320]  by people worse and then top by people worse so you always then sink to the
[02:56:47.320 --> 02:56:52.800]  bottom and I don't know how much I can explain this to people it is a absolute
[02:56:52.800 --> 02:56:58.240]  certainty that when I went this was already going on but for me when I went
[02:56:58.240 --> 02:57:01.960]  and saw the military training to go door-to-door in the US and take our guns
[02:57:01.960 --> 02:57:09.720]  it's all in police state 2000 when I went and saw that and then said well I
[02:57:09.720 --> 02:57:12.960]  better check our other drills hopefully it's not happening in other drills and
[02:57:12.960 --> 02:57:16.680]  I went to all these other drills and confirmed and saw them working with
[02:57:16.680 --> 02:57:23.120]  Boy Scouts to spy on their parents in the drills. I came back and started
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:27.120]  freaking out even though I had video of the Boy Scouts people thought it was
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:31.240]  fake. Now today I can show you the New York Times going look at our Explorer
[02:57:31.240 --> 02:57:34.920]  Scouts training to kill disgruntled veterans and they say it with a
[02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:47.960]  straight face can somebody say danger danger danger Will Robinson. I mean 100%
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:52.040]  the people running the government it's a lot bigger than Bill Clinton, Obama, Bush
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:57.000]  the the special interest running things have a horrible destiny for this
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.960]  country they're taking us in a bad place and we're all kind of tied up in the car
[02:58:01.960 --> 02:58:05.200]  with the serial killer and I'm trying to you know get out of the bonds I'm
[02:58:05.200 --> 02:58:08.440]  saying hey you're not tied down as hard kind of help me get out there like he'll
[02:58:08.440 --> 02:58:12.400]  hurt us if we if we resist I'm like listen he's taking us to some shack
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:16.080]  someplace to torture the daylights out of us our only chance is to get out of
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:22.800]  here you see that's the thing you're not gonna get out of this kissing up to

[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:21.800]  ahead hello hey hi Alex I'm glad you're talking about people getting angry and
[03:01:21.800 --> 03:01:25.800]  doing something I like I like Mark Dice's model of calling into different
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:30.560]  radio stations and not a freaking one I call is a guy named Norman Goldman you
[03:01:30.560 --> 03:01:34.440]  like an establishment liberal kind of rag and as soon as you mentioned Ron
[03:01:34.440 --> 03:01:38.120]  baller you mentioned any real issues or that Obama's bought off by Wall Street
[03:01:38.120 --> 03:01:43.120]  they'll just cut you right off but I think it's a good thing to do you know
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:46.960]  calling to liberal or any anybody radio shows and try and get something about the
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:53.440]  NDA or that both parties are bought off and yeah and just really keep hammering
[03:01:53.440 --> 03:01:57.600]  them like with with the phone mobs and you may have to use a pseudonym every
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:01.560]  once in a while but it's I think it's a good way to get some information out
[03:02:01.560 --> 03:02:06.360]  there absolutely I mean we're talking about all this tyranny plugging websites
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:10.400]  calling a talk radio doing your own local show getting your own access TV show
