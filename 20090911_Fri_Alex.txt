[01:49.000 --> 01:55.560]  biggest media event that I ever officiated over or oversaw and then
[01:55.560 --> 01:59.480]  Tuesday you saw the letter you heard the audio interview the live interview
[01:59.480 --> 02:07.400]  yesterday and the release of the video Charlie Sheen's video address to the

[02:18.960 --> 02:27.400]  linked up on major news websites like London Telegraph and the Sun massive
[02:27.400 --> 02:36.320]  massive massive massive media coverage dwarfing just three and a half four days
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.280]  into our release of this operation against the lie of 9-11 the lie of the
[02:41.280 --> 02:47.440]  official story the lie that was carried out to set up a global police state just
[02:47.440 --> 02:51.960]  three and a half four days into this operation it is already bigger than the
[02:51.960 --> 02:57.080]  last time Charlie Sheen went public on this radio show we commend his courage
[02:57.080 --> 03:07.880]  but you will get further revelations when he joins us live today coming up in
[03:07.880 --> 03:10.560]  two and a half hours

[03:19.920 --> 03:25.120]  place and going on White House blames media false reports to for scare
[03:25.120 --> 03:31.800]  resulting from Coast Guard exercise in the Potomac just a mile or so away from
[03:31.800 --> 03:37.440]  the White House Coast Guard training of Potomac causes scare official denies
[03:37.440 --> 03:45.400]  shots were fired so who knows it's really going on also White House resist
[03:45.400 --> 03:51.000]  offering details on financing health plan this from Bloomberg there's more
[03:51.000 --> 03:55.640]  disinformation saying that it doesn't cover illegal aliens when the federal
[03:55.640 --> 04:00.400]  government and state governments are already doing that and it clearly does
[04:00.400 --> 04:06.000]  Obama is setting a stage for using budget maneuver to pass health reform
[04:06.000 --> 04:10.640]  he's going to try to tag it on with all of the pork and ram it through even if
[04:10.640 --> 04:14.320]  it's very unpopular CNN of course yesterday caught putting out a fake
[04:14.320 --> 04:19.120]  poll where they said they sampled Republicans and Democrats 50-50 before
[04:19.120 --> 04:22.360]  and after his speech was actually two-thirds Democrats one-third Republicans
[04:22.360 --> 04:28.000]  complete fraud so we're going to be going over all of this today also an
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.680]  anti-abortion activist shot in front of a high school in Michigan will the media
[04:34.680 --> 04:38.280]  ring its hands and cry and whine about this for ten years and make movies about
[04:38.280 --> 04:44.160]  it probably not a lot of other financial and global news coming up and 9 11
[04:44.160 --> 04:50.360]  truth signatures stand behind call for new investigation

[08:01.360 --> 08:04.800]  revelation that the White House had no intention of making public president
[08:04.800 --> 08:09.200]  Bush was told in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning an attack
[08:09.200 --> 08:12.520]  involving the hijack could have predicted nobody our government at least
[08:12.520 --> 08:18.240]  August 6 PDT the title was bin Laden determined to attack inside the United
[08:18.240 --> 08:24.040]  States 70% of family members questions were never answered during the 9-11
[08:24.040 --> 08:28.080]  Commission report Thomas came said they were set up to fail I mean I remember
[08:28.080 --> 08:32.960]  the Commission it's a scam it's absolutely disgusting the questions Mr.
[08:32.960 --> 08:40.560]  president the questions building seven ablaze at the moment and apparently
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.440]  getting ready to collapse building seven free phone collapse well no there's
[08:45.440 --> 08:51.000]  number seven coming down the excitement and the fun the people get watching an
[08:51.000 --> 08:54.200]  old building being demolished and they wired very carefully for days and it's
[08:54.200 --> 08:57.680]  a very careful operation third time today
[08:57.680 --> 09:02.280]  those pictures revolting too much in television before when a building was
[09:02.280 --> 09:06.280]  deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down this one of
[09:06.280 --> 09:11.920]  things to us is pulling and they made that decision to pull then we watch the
[09:11.920 --> 09:16.560]  building collapse Jane what more can you tell us about the Salomon brother's
[09:16.560 --> 09:20.440]  building and its collapse well only really what you already know details are
[09:20.440 --> 09:23.680]  very very sketchy you're getting information now that one of the other
[09:23.680 --> 09:28.920]  buildings building seven in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has
[09:28.920 --> 09:32.600]  either collapsed or is collapsing
[09:34.760 --> 09:40.480]  vanishing airplane my close-up inspection there's no evidence of a plane
[09:40.480 --> 09:45.800]  having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon the only site is the actual side of the
[09:45.800 --> 09:49.920]  building that's crashed in and as I said the only pieces left that you can see
[09:49.920 --> 09:54.520]  are small enough that you could pick up in your hand there are no large tail
[09:54.520 --> 09:59.160]  sections wing sections a fuselage nothing like that anywhere around which
[09:59.160 --> 10:04.000]  would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.640]  firefighters and police describing explosions a lot of the secondary
[10:10.640 --> 10:14.280]  explosion we've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion
[10:14.280 --> 10:17.960]  all my thoughts that I'm popping out it was like was it for the head
[10:17.960 --> 10:22.280]  they needed to take down a building
[10:22.280 --> 10:26.040]  looks sort of like the building just demolished even if there was no secondary
[10:26.040 --> 10:29.880]  explosives in the building like gunfire you know bang bang bang bang bang and then
[10:29.880 --> 10:34.320]  and then also a big explosion do you know if it was an explosion if it was a
[10:34.320 --> 10:40.320]  building collapse to me it sounded like it to me it sounded like an explosion
[10:40.320 --> 10:45.440]  chief Albert Turry told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he
[10:45.440 --> 10:49.680]  could but he said that there was another explosion which took place and then an
[10:49.680 --> 10:56.080]  hour after there was a another explosion in one of the towers here
[10:56.080 --> 11:02.080]  Sebel Edmonds FBI translator breaking her gag order
[11:02.080 --> 11:06.480]  all our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban
[11:06.480 --> 11:13.280]  we did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th
[11:13.280 --> 11:19.080]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Raoapendi for kidney dialysis treatment
[11:19.080 --> 11:22.960]  the military had him surrounded they were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be
[11:22.960 --> 11:26.680]  watched carefully and looked at
[11:26.680 --> 11:29.240]  Norad standing down
[11:29.240 --> 11:33.560]  where were the planes?
[11:33.560 --> 11:34.560]  on now to one of the
[11:34.560 --> 11:38.560]  erious moments amid the carnage of 9-11 a mysterious plane was seen flying right
[11:38.560 --> 11:42.840]  over the president's residence the E-4B's over New York and Washington
[11:42.840 --> 11:47.480]  otherwise known as the doomsday planes has never been officially explained
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.440]  cell phones working at impossible altitudes
[11:52.440 --> 11:57.440]  solicitor general Ted Olson receiving phone calls at the FBI says
[11:57.440 --> 12:01.000]  were never made what happened during that call this is the only information we
[12:01.000 --> 12:04.560]  have on these terrorists
[12:04.560 --> 12:09.040]  she was able to call him twice how she could pull that off we don't know but
[12:09.040 --> 12:10.920]  she did
[12:10.920 --> 12:14.960]  these are the questions Mr. President these are the questions
[12:14.960 --> 12:20.760]  they go on and on
[12:20.760 --> 12:23.120]  good afternoon Mr. President
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.000]  I come to you today representing the families of the victims of September 11th
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.680]  as well as millions of my fellow Americans
[12:31.680 --> 12:34.600]  hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter
[12:34.600 --> 12:35.480]  to you
[12:35.480 --> 12:37.960]  twenty minutes with the president
[12:37.960 --> 12:42.520]  and if not at least that its contents brought to your attention
[12:42.520 --> 12:45.160]  we have questions Mr. President
[12:45.160 --> 12:47.000]  lots of questions
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.640]  a lot of them are detailed
[12:48.640 --> 12:50.000]  in my letter
[12:50.000 --> 12:50.880]  but trust me
[12:50.880 --> 12:54.960]  there are hundreds of more questions
[12:54.960 --> 12:57.520]  as my letter chronicles
[12:57.520 --> 12:59.680]  the 9-11 commission itself
[12:59.680 --> 13:01.240]  says they relied to
[13:01.240 --> 13:02.920]  deceived and
[13:02.920 --> 13:07.720]  essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation
[13:07.720 --> 13:09.880]  people of the United States and the world
[13:09.880 --> 13:13.880]  demand the truth sir
[13:13.880 --> 13:20.000]  that's what a patriot does
[13:20.000 --> 13:21.320]  you sir
[13:21.320 --> 13:24.520]  have the power as well as the responsibility
[13:24.520 --> 13:28.480]  to initiate a truly independent congressional investigation
[13:28.480 --> 13:30.320]  into the events of 9-11
[13:30.320 --> 13:32.520]  as well as its aftermath
[13:32.520 --> 13:34.720]  we want our country back Mr. President
[13:34.720 --> 13:39.320]  therefore I'm not just calling on you and your team, I'm calling on each and every American citizen
[13:39.320 --> 13:40.360]  to wake up
[13:40.360 --> 13:41.680]  stand up
[13:41.680 --> 13:44.000]  and demand the truth
[13:44.000 --> 13:46.120]  and count on you Mr. President
[13:46.120 --> 13:53.120]  be on the right side of history
[14:06.800 --> 14:08.280]  are you now saying
[14:08.280 --> 14:14.440]  that they weren't asking to block an investigation? An investigation must not interfere
[14:14.440 --> 14:16.120]  with the ongoing efforts
[14:16.120 --> 14:17.960]  to prevent the next attack
[14:17.960 --> 14:25.960]  Senator Tom Vashal said last week that he called him several times
[14:26.240 --> 14:31.840]  we are live it is September 11th, 2009
[14:31.840 --> 14:36.080]  eight years after the tragic attacks
[14:36.080 --> 14:41.120]  it appears that a PSYOP is going on right now
[14:41.120 --> 14:45.360]  on the Potomac River in Washington DC
[14:45.360 --> 14:49.520]  remember how they did the Air Force One photo op flyover that flew within a few
[14:49.520 --> 14:52.560]  hundred yards of major skyscrapers
[14:52.560 --> 14:56.760]  and then it turned out that it was classified to tales and the White House
[14:56.760 --> 14:58.720]  had ordered
[14:58.720 --> 15:03.760]  the New York City police and other emergency agencies not to tell Mayor
[15:03.760 --> 15:05.160]  Bloomberg
[15:05.160 --> 15:09.120]  weeks before they said do not tell Mayor Bloomberg
[15:09.120 --> 15:12.360]  and do not tell the rest of the city departments about what we're about to do
[15:12.360 --> 15:13.720]  with this flyover
[15:13.720 --> 15:18.160]  now that is not a stinking photo op because they want a photo
[15:18.160 --> 15:20.960]  of Air Force One
[15:20.960 --> 15:26.600]  without Obama in it they have several Air Force Ones flying through the middle of
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.020]  lower Manhattan
[15:30.020 --> 15:33.520]  and that didn't come out for a week
[15:33.520 --> 15:37.080]  the White House and the National Security Council
[15:37.080 --> 15:39.480]  were telling the city
[15:39.480 --> 15:42.480]  telling the police I thought they work for the mayor I thought they work for the
[15:42.480 --> 15:44.600]  people I thought they work for the incorporated
[15:44.600 --> 15:50.080]  city under state law well they do but that shows how federalized things are
[15:50.080 --> 15:51.700]  remember that
[15:51.700 --> 15:54.960]  then it came out that the highest levels of the White House were involved
[15:54.960 --> 15:57.320]  telling the police this is secret
[15:57.320 --> 16:00.920]  because they wanted to scare everyone they wanted to have the city say we
[16:00.920 --> 16:02.360]  don't know what's going on
[16:02.360 --> 16:04.680]  for that first day so everyone would freak out
[16:04.680 --> 16:06.160]  and so it would invoke
[16:06.160 --> 16:09.720]  the memories of nine eleven again it was a test to bring back
[16:09.720 --> 16:12.440]  the memories of nine eleven and then this morning
[16:12.440 --> 16:15.120]  and I believe the Coast Guard isn't involved in this
[16:15.120 --> 16:18.680]  they send the Coast Guard out to do some type of live fire drill
[16:18.680 --> 16:20.440]  on the Potomac
[16:20.440 --> 16:24.360]  just a mile or so away from the White House in the middle of all those
[16:24.360 --> 16:25.560]  monuments
[16:25.560 --> 16:27.840]  they have scores of boats running around
[16:27.840 --> 16:32.560]  reports in mainstream AP Reuters you name it of shots being fired
[16:32.560 --> 16:36.400]  and then they have the vice admiral go on TV live he's on TV live right now and
[16:36.400 --> 16:37.160]  say look
[16:37.160 --> 16:41.520]  they just told us to do this drill we you know we do these a few times a year
[16:41.520 --> 16:45.000]  but see CNN the main sci-op network
[16:45.000 --> 16:48.320]  Fox is kind of like the comic book network of ridiculous propaganda but
[16:48.320 --> 16:49.760]  CNN's some more slick
[16:49.760 --> 16:51.720]  that's come out the Pentagon openly runs it
[16:51.720 --> 16:54.280]  that came out in two thousand
[16:54.280 --> 16:58.720]  Anderson Cooper's admitted CIA quote graduated out of the CIA out of college
[16:58.720 --> 17:01.800]  was recruited in quote got out of the CIA are right
[17:01.800 --> 17:04.240]  and he's the heir to the Astor fortune
[17:04.240 --> 17:08.320]  just like Tucker Carlson's the heir to one of those big fortunes is ridiculous
[17:08.320 --> 17:11.120]  so that was a sci-op to test
[17:11.120 --> 17:16.880]  re invoking fears on nine eleven so while
[17:16.880 --> 17:19.520]  while Obama's giving a speech at the Pentagon
[17:19.520 --> 17:23.040]  on one side of the Potomac on the other side you got the White House
[17:23.040 --> 17:25.480]  there in that big river
[17:25.480 --> 17:28.480]  you've got all these patrol boats running around
[17:28.480 --> 17:30.920]  reports of shots fired
[17:30.920 --> 17:33.920]  all sorts of hysteria and CNN's right on it
[17:33.920 --> 17:38.880]  to videotape it live and send it out as it's happening all how convenient
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.200]  to create this idea of fear again
[17:42.200 --> 17:43.280]  no doubt
[17:43.280 --> 17:47.000]  this is staged absolutely yeah wrong team but
[17:47.000 --> 17:49.400]  that's all compartmentalization works
[17:49.400 --> 17:53.160]  I will also guarantee you the Coast Guard knows nothing about it they just
[17:53.160 --> 17:54.560]  follow orders
[17:54.560 --> 17:56.400]  it's a drill
[17:56.400 --> 17:57.640]  now was this
[17:57.640 --> 18:00.880]  going to be a drill they used to bootleg a real terror attack on the
[18:00.880 --> 18:04.520]  president while he was at the Pentagon
[18:04.520 --> 18:08.600]  they used a drill to move forty four thousand u.s. troops in eighteen thousand
[18:08.600 --> 18:12.120]  British troops into position in the two months before nine eleven
[18:12.120 --> 18:15.920]  in the country surrounding Afghanistan
[18:15.920 --> 18:19.600]  and to move in the carrier task force attack groups two of them
[18:19.600 --> 18:24.080]  then bush one day before nine eleven source newsweek msnbc
[18:24.080 --> 18:27.160]  sign the launch orders to attack afghanistan
[18:27.160 --> 18:29.640]  in three days
[18:29.640 --> 18:32.760]  he signed that one day before nine eleven that we could come out announce
[18:32.760 --> 18:34.960]  afghanistan did it on nine eleven
[18:34.960 --> 18:38.880]  and then a day and a half later launched the attacks completely
[18:38.880 --> 18:40.560]  staged
[18:40.560 --> 18:44.240]  that'd be like if you saw
[18:44.240 --> 18:46.960]  a hundred police cars show up outside your door
[18:46.960 --> 18:50.640]  and then you watched a cop drop a brick of cocaine your backyard
[18:50.640 --> 18:53.560]  and then when they when they raid you and drag you away you're saying well
[18:53.560 --> 18:58.440]  you know i saw the police arrived before you even planted that
[18:58.440 --> 19:01.120]  you can think of a better analogy it's like the fire department showing up to
[19:01.120 --> 19:04.480]  a house before it burns down
[19:04.480 --> 19:08.280]  forty four thousand u.s. troops to carrier strike groups
[19:08.280 --> 19:14.840]  in the gulf
[19:14.840 --> 19:17.640]  in the two months before
[19:17.640 --> 19:19.400]  nine eleven
[19:19.400 --> 19:23.600]  so the white house calls up and says the police homeless curte says don't tell
[19:23.600 --> 19:26.160]  the mayor don't tell the city about this
[19:26.160 --> 19:30.080]  we're gonna fly a jet to the middle of the city
[19:30.080 --> 19:33.760]  in some cases two hundred and fifty yards away from skyscrapers
[19:33.760 --> 19:36.520]  incredibly dangerous
[19:36.520 --> 19:38.480]  and that's why i said we don't know what happened
[19:38.480 --> 19:41.760]  i was a photo off and then it came out now they stage the whole deal
[19:41.760 --> 19:43.880]  and they're testing size
[19:43.880 --> 19:46.680]  and i want to say thank you
[19:46.680 --> 19:49.440]  to people controlling uh...
[19:49.440 --> 19:52.240]  brock obama i mean at least they didn't fly planes in the buildings again i
[19:52.240 --> 19:53.520]  mean least they're just doing
[19:53.520 --> 19:55.480]  side ops like gulf of tonkin
[19:55.480 --> 20:00.640]  where they say they attack the ship ships never even got attacked

[25:02.720 --> 25:07.560]  attacks now sheen says they were an inside job and that the nine eleven commission report
[25:07.560 --> 25:12.560]  was quote a blatant work of manipulation hey wait a minute maybe charlie sheen can fill
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.200]  obama's next star vacancy stay put let not your heart be troubled the great american
[25:17.200 --> 25:25.960]  panels next and then they went on to talk trash we're going to play more of these clips as

[25:31.080 --> 25:36.120]  this is the biggest thing i've ever done in the monday video in fact who skew that up
[25:36.120 --> 25:41.000]  because some people never listen to what i say people are like this letter is yet and
[25:41.000 --> 25:47.720]  i said no the letter is meant to get the media's attention so that the debate will be about
[25:47.720 --> 25:53.000]  obama not investigating the fact that six of the ten commissioners on the nine eleven
[25:53.000 --> 25:57.480]  commission even in the washington post and in books they wrote themselves say it was
[25:57.480 --> 26:03.720]  a cover up a criminal lie that there should be a criminal investigation not just a new
[26:03.720 --> 26:12.480]  independent commission let's go ahead and play a riley here it is
[26:12.480 --> 26:17.960]  on the page here on the pinhead front actor charlie sheen he's a bit out there on political
[26:17.960 --> 26:24.000]  matters he continues to believe nine eleven was an american conspiracy america deserves
[26:24.000 --> 26:29.000]  better and come on come on people the nine eleven commission report is a blatant work
[26:29.000 --> 26:36.000]  of manipulation secrecy and fiction come on the time is now demand the truth
[26:36.000 --> 26:41.360]  it's changing it off in a series offensive to those who lost loved ones on nine eleven
[26:41.360 --> 26:48.040]  and he is a pinhead you know that's not going to work orally the majority of the nine eleven
[26:48.040 --> 26:52.240]  victims families in the heads of those groups have been on this show and have protested
[26:52.240 --> 26:56.080]  outside the white house and at ground zero and they're there today like bob macklevin
[26:56.080 --> 27:02.600]  and others who lost his son and bill dole saying nine eleven is a total inside job period
[27:02.600 --> 27:10.880]  it's you it's you individuals out there you absolute pieces of trash that wrap yourselves
[27:10.880 --> 27:16.240]  in the american flag for your police state and you used the lie of nine eleven to say
[27:16.240 --> 27:23.720]  saddam hussein the former cia asset had carried out the attacks and he had nukes and wmd's
[27:23.720 --> 27:33.620]  and yellow cake from niger it's you that have the blood of over a million three hundred
[27:33.620 --> 27:40.160]  thousand at iraq he's in five thousand dead us troops on your hands and by the way that's
[27:40.160 --> 27:44.520]  a skewed number two they cook everything just like the unemployment numbers if you die from
[27:44.520 --> 27:51.080]  wounds sustained in afghanistan or iraq outside of iraq or afghanistan previously they would
[27:51.080 --> 27:56.280]  count you as a casualty of the war it was more than fifteen thousand over a year ago
[27:56.280 --> 28:00.880]  the last time i saw the numbers of real dead us troops they just don't count it if you
[28:00.880 --> 28:06.520]  die in romstein or if you die back in england or back in the united states they don't count
[28:06.520 --> 28:13.360]  it if you're dying on a medivac being flown out of country so i don't know what it is
[28:13.360 --> 28:17.600]  right now it's very hard to find those numbers last time it was fifteen thousand and change
[28:17.600 --> 28:22.880]  each piece of that change a human life and it's not just loose change to us these are
[28:22.880 --> 28:27.680]  human beings who really believed your lie that saddam Hussein had hit us and hit us
[28:27.680 --> 28:33.880]  hard and they went over there and fought for what they believe was this country you use
[28:33.880 --> 28:42.360]  those patriots like toilet paper and you wrap them around you to give yourself the allure
[28:42.360 --> 28:51.240]  and the light and the gleam of a hero it's disgusting what you murderers do and you
[28:51.240 --> 28:55.960]  were aiding and abetting these murderers hanity you know riley and all the rest of you attacking

[36:48.240 --> 36:52.680]  the people so i'm just trying to show you your power that's what gondi tried to do that's
[36:52.680 --> 36:56.840]  what martin luther king tried to do and that's what gets you killed i'll tell you right
[36:56.840 --> 37:03.640]  now i'm walking around in expressway traffic doing this and i don't enjoy it but i do enjoy
[37:03.640 --> 37:09.600]  seeing the victories against tyranny because the establishment knows how much power you've
[37:09.600 --> 37:17.920]  got from berlin germany to tokyo japan from beijing china to london england to los angeles
[37:17.920 --> 37:25.520]  to san francisco to boina saris german tv ecuadorian tv i mean it just goes on and
[37:25.520 --> 37:33.280]  on have you done a start page dot com or google search if you've gone out to a search engine
[37:33.280 --> 37:41.680]  and searched obama poster in the news and then german news or russian news or japanese news
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.800]  i mean i can't even watch them all there's i don't know i can't put a number on i probably
[37:46.800 --> 37:53.920]  watched 300 400 i mean i know it's more than 300 it hundreds some days i'd see 50 60 and
[37:53.920 --> 37:58.440]  waste an hour watching i don't have the time by the way i've got to announce the winners
[37:58.440 --> 38:05.240]  of the poster contest but here's the issue i've been so busy launching this operation
[38:05.240 --> 38:10.120]  that i haven't watched all the videos that came in dozens and dozens and dozens of those
[38:10.120 --> 38:14.000]  on the new poster contest we had a new poster contest where you can make whatever political
[38:14.000 --> 38:18.600]  poster you want shoot video of it posted and i've got some more of those to watch tonight
[38:18.600 --> 38:22.320]  so sometime over the weekend i'll announce the winners in the story and then monday
[38:22.320 --> 38:26.400]  go through it in detail i just bite off more than i can chew and i know folks understand
[38:26.400 --> 38:31.600]  so i apologize that i just i i can easily walk in there and just pick three good ones
[38:31.600 --> 38:36.040]  but i want to go ahead and see all of them that came in as of tuesday when the contest
[38:36.040 --> 38:42.480]  closed so i'll be announcing that on monday just because i'm not going to shortchange
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.080]  anybody i'm going to watch them all and i'm just i've run out of time and i went to bed
[38:47.080 --> 38:50.040]  at two last night i'm not complaining i'm just doing everything i can by the way we
[38:50.040 --> 38:57.560]  got huge announcements coming up with charlie's on with us but look the issue here is that
[38:57.560 --> 39:03.640]  was an example of showing you the power you have and then the second contest is about
[39:03.640 --> 39:08.480]  saying look it doesn't have to be our obama joker poster it could be about vaccines it
[39:08.480 --> 39:13.280]  could be anti-war it could be anti-drug war could be anti-police state it could be pro
[39:13.280 --> 39:18.200]  second amendment it could be whatever political message you want whatever we think is the
[39:18.200 --> 39:23.520]  best produced poster that is publicly posted videotaped and then put on the web and sent
[39:23.520 --> 39:29.440]  to us it's not enough to just make the posters about going out in the street and then putting
[39:29.440 --> 39:37.600]  it on areas that your city ordinances allow you to now no exaggeration hundreds of local
[39:37.600 --> 39:47.920]  newscast scores of national newscast tens of millions reached on tv and internet millions
[39:47.920 --> 39:54.000]  reached in places like miami and san francisco some cities had thousands of the posters put
[39:54.000 --> 40:00.120]  up other people saw it copied it it's still going still getting bigger that's an example
[40:00.120 --> 40:06.000]  of you with with with with stuff printed up at kinko's or off your home printer you can
[40:06.000 --> 40:13.360]  print off 100 copies of that for what 1015 bucks maybe less go out staple them up or
[40:13.360 --> 40:20.200]  glue them up or tape them up or pin them up and one poster at the corner of a busy four
[40:20.200 --> 40:26.840]  way stop on a telephone pole by the missing dog or missing cat poster people will look
[40:26.840 --> 40:33.000]  at your political poster you'll reach hundreds of people even if it's just up a few hours
[40:33.000 --> 40:40.920]  it's the idea i mean they've got legal fcc approved am fraction of a watt transmitters
[40:40.920 --> 40:45.000]  that when you put it into the right little five foot antenna on your roof goes out upwards
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.200]  of three miles you put one of those on your roof totally legal totally lawful plug it
[40:50.200 --> 40:54.640]  into the computer stream whatever you want get an audience in a few months put up posters
[40:54.640 --> 40:59.000]  all over the listening area you'll have you you'll have hundreds and hundreds of people
[40:59.000 --> 41:08.640]  listening within days all we're about is solutions and that's why come and tell pro attacks us
[41:08.640 --> 41:13.680]  why the media attacks us and lies about us and his represents us because we are kicking
[41:13.680 --> 41:22.720]  absolute new world order but we are kicking new world order but by showing the people
[41:22.720 --> 41:27.120]  the power they have now with this charlie sheen idea when i say we can take the country in
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.880]  the world back instead of letting the establishment try to rewrite history because we took history
[41:31.880 --> 41:37.440]  back the majority of people in every major poll believe nine eleven's an inside job now
[41:37.440 --> 41:40.720]  with the bare minimum the government covered it up eighty four percent of new york times
[41:40.720 --> 41:50.920]  poll three years ago and when we get out and get involved and take action and when
[41:50.920 --> 41:57.120]  we come out with a stunt like this and get it front and center in front of the media
[41:57.120 --> 42:02.840]  doling out the audio interviews and live interviews in the letter and the video release in the
[42:02.840 --> 42:08.680]  message of the president and then live today with big announcements and challenges oh yes
[42:08.680 --> 42:18.560]  when we do that it creates a perfect storm and it didn't mean we'll succeed and totally
[42:18.560 --> 42:24.400]  bring down the globalist this time no it is the resistance that is the victory and it's
[42:24.400 --> 42:29.680]  resisting with the truth and standing up to the lie that is the victory it is the spiritual
[42:29.680 --> 42:35.480]  psychological act of setting your mind in motion and setting your body in motion against
[42:35.480 --> 42:48.840]  the new order setting your will against them committing and so when hannity and limbaugh
[42:48.840 --> 42:56.680]  and bill o'reilly attack when they attack when they come out and attack the majority
[42:56.680 --> 43:01.240]  of their viewers know they're twisting and lying and they could see it in the tone and
[43:01.240 --> 43:07.880]  see it in their face and it reignites and makes people think about the inside job and
[43:07.880 --> 43:11.120]  then they already know it's true in their heart they know it's true in their intellect and
[43:11.120 --> 43:16.520]  we win the national geographic hit piece we win oh they'll get some of the brain dead
[43:16.520 --> 43:22.280]  soulless drones but humanity that's still awake and alive and still has a soul and
[43:22.280 --> 43:29.080]  a connection to truth recognizes truth and they resonate with the courage of charlie
[43:29.080 --> 43:35.600]  sheen with you know all of his baggage big deal everybody's got package he's got a lot
[43:35.600 --> 43:41.040]  of good baggage of having a person and being a person of a lot of courage by putting himself
[43:41.040 --> 43:44.360]  out there he's the perfect bait for them to grab it and then it blows up in their face
[43:44.360 --> 43:53.840]  every time and we knew it would so pray for us though because there's always a price to
[43:53.840 --> 44:05.920]  pay the old african proverb what is it a zulu proverb no good deed goes unpunished it's
[44:05.920 --> 44:14.160]  true but no good deed goes unrewarded as well because I've learned in my life the curses
[44:14.160 --> 44:19.000]  the bad things enemies do to you it always has a price up front but if you take it carefully
[44:19.000 --> 44:28.920]  and say thank you God that my enemies are attacking me like Job in the end you get it
[44:28.920 --> 44:35.080]  all back many times over when you tune into your heart tune into to love tune into your
[44:35.080 --> 44:46.760]  center and I the only time I ask God for anything is all my prayers are God just just use me
[44:46.760 --> 44:51.080]  as a vessel I know I'm not perfect help me make the right decisions lead God and direct
[44:51.080 --> 44:57.600]  me but please I don't want to die but please have them kill me first just don't let them
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.880]  hurt my family that's the one thing and I and I feel bad even asking God for something
[45:02.880 --> 45:07.040]  but I just say please let the new world order torture me rip me in pieces just protect my
[45:07.040 --> 45:12.160]  little ones and I trust in God's going to do that in fact I know in my heart and it's
[45:12.160 --> 45:22.640]  just it's such an incredibly fulfilling feeling to know that the creator of the universe has
[45:22.640 --> 45:33.560]  got his eye on my family because God loves the sparrow sitting in the little tree loves
[45:33.560 --> 45:41.400]  it like you can't even imagine how much more does God love you as a society as a species
[45:41.400 --> 45:51.120]  we are children this is all a growing process it's all a test and I'm just glad that in
[45:51.120 --> 45:58.720]  my life that I didn't fall to the dark side I almost did but I think that was part of
[45:58.720 --> 46:05.920]  God's plans that I could see what evil is and then be taken back at the edge and then
[46:05.920 --> 46:14.160]  taken up on the mountain let's go ahead and go to Ted Anderson Ted I wanted to get you
[46:14.160 --> 46:20.760]  on because I remember you two weeks ago offering gold at nine hundred and eleven to nine hundred
[46:20.760 --> 46:26.200]  and fourteen dollars an ounce when it was at nine sixty and now it's up at what one thousand
[46:26.200 --> 46:34.680]  thirteen today and you've still got some gold left at the much lower price but this is the
[46:34.680 --> 46:40.560]  absolute end as the Jim Morrison song goes this is the end my friend of our elaborate
[46:40.560 --> 46:48.120]  plans plans at the end I'll never look into your eyes again my friend it's the end Ted
[46:48.120 --> 46:54.200]  Anderson incredible explosion in gold it is it's a real hot market right now and and like
[46:54.200 --> 46:58.560]  you said we're working at that nine forty five level now and and with gold at a thousand
[46:58.560 --> 47:04.040]  thirteen that looks awfully like an awfully good buy my guests being in the market as
[47:04.040 --> 47:09.400]  long as I have been I'll be looking to buy in bargain levels when it reaches back down
[47:09.400 --> 47:14.880]  to this price within the net but the next three four weeks I don't expect to see gold
[47:14.880 --> 47:19.960]  hold at this a thousand thirteen level just due to the fact that the resistance level
[47:19.960 --> 47:25.880]  at nine forty five was held real strong and then it started bouncing into the thousands
[47:25.880 --> 47:30.720]  I'm guessing we'll be sitting here maybe between eleven hundred and twelve hundred dollars
[47:30.720 --> 47:35.680]  now it's very shortly and when you see a thousand thirteen you're gonna go wow that's
[47:35.680 --> 47:40.280]  a good price I better grab a hold of it now when I while I can at least that's the way
[47:40.280 --> 47:45.040]  I look at it and so I just want to say right now the stuff that I'm working at nine forty
[47:45.040 --> 47:49.520]  five is going to look as far as I'm concerned that much better the only thing that are you
[47:49.520 --> 47:53.680]  kidding Ted are you saying you still have gold at nine forty five when it's one thousand
[47:53.680 --> 47:57.400]  thirteen yeah I'm still holding the prices remember we were talking about the Franks
[47:57.400 --> 48:00.600]  at two thirty three okay I thought you were going to go up because I have to know you're
[48:00.600 --> 48:06.200]  about you bought your last buy at about nine hundred eighty six you were telling me yesterday
[48:06.200 --> 48:11.080]  so you've got a little bit left at the nine forty something range I mean that is insane
[48:11.080 --> 48:15.320]  Ted well it is but you know that what I'm doing here is I'm just trying to hang in
[48:15.320 --> 48:20.840]  there throughout the weekend with what I have I know you know full well that I'm restricted
[48:20.840 --> 48:27.720]  to what I can do silver now has seen a high of seventeen dollars and two cents so I know
[48:27.720 --> 48:32.480]  I won't be able to do a whole lot there anymore but I still have we talked about the ten dollar
[48:32.480 --> 48:37.440]  liberties we talked about the sovereigns and Franks you know a silver at seventeen dollars
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.320]  an ounce I had had my head examined but I still have the walking liberty halves at eight sixty
[48:42.320 --> 48:48.600]  nine and that's back when silver was at eleven dollars an ounce it's really shot up so yeah
[48:48.600 --> 48:52.880]  there's a there's just a few little you know as far as I'm concerned buys that are out there
[48:52.880 --> 48:58.040]  screaming saying hey get me because you're not going to be able to do this again you
[48:58.040 --> 49:02.840]  know so I would say right now at this point in time if you're have any sense to it at
[49:02.840 --> 49:07.360]  all if you've been thinking about it you know that you did you realize that thirty one what
[49:07.360 --> 49:12.560]  I think it was thirty one those thirty five to one the insider traders right now are selling
[49:12.560 --> 49:17.160]  the U.S. stock market and getting away from it I mean it's just that well that's exactly
[49:17.160 --> 49:22.600]  what Bob Chapman is coming up said like eight months ago he said when it was at its bottom
[49:22.600 --> 49:27.200]  he said they're going to run it back up and then plunge it again and this is it's a suckers
[49:27.200 --> 49:31.880]  rally they just do this over and over and over again but the trend is downward they
[49:31.880 --> 49:36.880]  jack it up drop it down but overall it goes down and I warned everybody I said folks well
[49:36.880 --> 49:41.480]  the markets up in the last few months I said get the hell out but they just people won't
[49:41.480 --> 49:46.840]  listen they love to be suckered Ted they do and you know I honestly I get a little bit
[49:46.840 --> 49:50.360]  feverish when I see the price of gold rising and I think that's the reason why I need to
[49:50.360 --> 49:54.680]  buy it but when you look at what's going on in the market in its entirety right now you
[49:54.680 --> 49:59.320]  you're a fool you're a fool to stay in paper currency and you're a fool to be in the stock
[49:59.320 --> 50:04.080]  market Ted I had a little bit of money I've been so busy I haven't bought any gold or
[50:04.080 --> 50:07.680]  silver you know every six months or so I buy a little few coins here and there and now I
[50:07.680 --> 50:11.840]  feel like an idiot myself I understand why some people don't move then they move when
[50:11.840 --> 50:15.640]  it goes up because I'm about to move when it's up by the way keep me some of that just
[50:15.640 --> 50:20.760]  a few coins please I've been forgetting to call you I've been too busy I mean I'm in
[50:20.760 --> 50:24.680]  the same boat Ted well you know I mean if you have Charlie Sheen coming up you better
[50:24.680 --> 50:28.640]  be focused on that but yeah I got the paint peeling off my garage and the neighbors are
[50:28.640 --> 50:32.360]  getting mad in the neighborhood yeah I'm too busy to call people to paint it or go out
[50:32.360 --> 50:36.480]  and paint it myself I've got to get the gold in the silver eight hundred six eight six

[1:02:08.760 --> 1:02:15.320]  1-800-259-9231 what do you think about the white house blaming media for false reports for scare
[1:02:15.320 --> 1:02:23.400]  resulting from coast guard exercise yeah see they have the media standing by cnn to hype it and make
[1:02:23.400 --> 1:02:28.680]  a big deal out of it as a scyop and then blame it on the media who carried it out for the winehouse
[1:02:28.680 --> 1:02:33.480]  just like it came out that the white house tried to blame the media first for air force one flying
[1:02:33.480 --> 1:02:42.120]  in between buildings a couple hundred yards away a few months ago as a scyop earlier this year and
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:47.960]  then it came out they told the city the police department don't tell the fire department don't
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:53.800]  tell the other city agencies the feds said don't tell anybody so the city freaked out and flipped
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:03:00.520]  out and said they didn't know what was happening to test the scyop to re ignite the mental memories
[1:03:00.520 --> 1:03:05.080]  of 9 11 to re invoke them and i have no doubt that's what's happened with this thing in the
[1:03:05.080 --> 1:03:10.920]  potomac white house press secretary robert gibbs today said he was not aware of any heads up given
[1:03:10.920 --> 1:03:14.760]  by the u.s coast guard the white house about the training exercise in the potomac river this morning
[1:03:14.760 --> 1:03:19.160]  as president obama was at the pentagon commemorating the 9 11 attacks and he suggested any panic that
[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:23.320]  resulted from the reporting to the event was the fault of the media not law enforcement
[1:03:23.320 --> 1:03:27.640]  media that just so happened to be aiming their cameras at it and reporting shots fired he said
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:31.960]  the report was based on listening to a police scanner and wasn't verified before being reported
[1:03:31.960 --> 1:03:35.240]  oh yes because they were talking about a terror attack on the scanner a drill
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:41.400]  many media outlets falsely reported that shots have been fired if anyone was a
[1:03:41.400 --> 1:03:46.600]  unnecessarily alarmed because the erroneous reporting that detonated shots have been fired
[1:03:48.920 --> 1:03:51.560]  i think everybody is apologetic of that gibbs said
[1:03:53.480 --> 1:03:57.240]  white house spokesman said commander in chief would not micromanage the coast guard's decision
[1:03:57.240 --> 1:04:02.360]  hold the exercise and he chastised the press in honor of those who died on 9 11 see
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:06.840]  and the future victims of terrorism telling reporters to tell themselves we may not get
[1:04:06.840 --> 1:04:12.040]  this first but we may be the first ones to get it right so see oh he was the fatherly figure
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:17.640]  calming everyone the terrorist haven't struck as i stand here as your war chief your war bird
[1:04:19.080 --> 1:04:24.440]  just like bush when he was at glenn eagles over in scotland for the g8 and then boom the terrorist
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:30.360]  strike he gets to grandstand we ought to be thankful that the national security council's only staging
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:35.400]  gulf of tonkin events remember nothing attacked those ships they just said they were
[1:04:35.400 --> 1:04:43.240]  same thing here they love it remember chaney wanted to attack us ships to blame it on iran and
[1:04:43.240 --> 1:04:47.880]  they just love it and they love using drills to fear murder that's why they run anti-terror
[1:04:47.880 --> 1:04:51.320]  drills one of the reasons is to blow up buses blow up things in your town and then later
[1:04:51.320 --> 1:04:55.320]  announced it was a drill it's part of creating that psychological perception that there really

[1:09:23.400 --> 1:09:30.360]  of it on the web the first video we uploaded has over a hundred thousand views i would guess it'll
[1:09:30.360 --> 1:09:36.520]  have over 300 000 views by tomorrow but if you will get it and send it out to your entire email list
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:44.840]  posted everywhere we could get a million views on it on that one original video i have no doubt
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:50.440]  it's already been seen over a million times tv stations are playing it uh the sun grabbed our
[1:09:50.440 --> 1:09:55.080]  video posted it in their own format and their player it's just everywhere i can't even track it
[1:09:55.080 --> 1:10:00.360]  i would conservatively say one million people less than 24 hours after the launch you've seen it
[1:10:01.720 --> 1:10:05.320]  so again get the video get it out to everybody i think it's one of the best videos we've ever
[1:10:05.320 --> 1:10:11.320]  produced great job erin dykes and charlie sheen so please take action on that i want to go to
[1:10:11.320 --> 1:10:17.240]  your calls but i want to first play a clip this is from politico and the headline on politico
[1:10:17.240 --> 1:10:26.520]  talks about cnn taking heat for the coast guard story just like cnn took heat for scaring everybody
[1:10:26.520 --> 1:10:32.520]  with the air force one flying through the new york and then it turned out the white house
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.320]  ran the whole thing as a psi op later and told the police not to tell the city what it was weeks
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:43.880]  before they planned this thing this is all planned to reinvent fears on 9 11 this is outrageous
[1:10:43.880 --> 1:10:50.680]  here it is the department of homeland security is now confirming that this was an exercise
[1:10:50.680 --> 1:10:57.320]  that no shots of any variety live or blank were fired we saw things happening on the water we could
[1:10:57.320 --> 1:11:02.840]  see boats racing around and we were listening to coast guard radio traffic they said on the radio
[1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:08.040]  10 rounds had been expended to have this happen on 9 11 where well commemoration ceremonies
[1:11:08.040 --> 1:11:13.960]  happening at the pentagon right next door yeah really quite amazing she invokes it herself she's
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:19.720]  being it's on her telescreen it's on her teleprompter there as she speaks into the
[1:11:19.720 --> 1:11:24.040]  telescreen to the american people people the world in case people weren't connecting to 9 11
[1:11:24.040 --> 1:11:29.720]  as he speaks about 9 11 just a mile away we thought terrorists had hit oh my goody gum drops
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:35.720]  it's just terrible that this is happening this is just so horrible oh we're so sorry but they
[1:11:35.720 --> 1:11:42.760]  did say it over the radio oh my goodness remember air force one photo opt triggers panic in Manhattan
[1:11:42.760 --> 1:11:48.440]  and then it came out weeks later they staged it all exactly as we told you if it walks like a duck
[1:11:48.440 --> 1:11:55.480]  quacks like a duck it is a duck this thing doesn't walk like an angel it doesn't talk like an angel
[1:11:55.480 --> 1:12:06.680]  it isn't a devil in disguise it's in red pajamas so finish up with a CNN clip been expended to have
[1:12:06.680 --> 1:12:11.480]  this happen on 9 11 where well commemoration ceremonies happening at the pentagon right next
[1:12:11.480 --> 1:12:17.400]  door yeah really quite amazing you can be sure uh that there's going to be a lot of high level
[1:12:17.400 --> 1:12:24.840]  demand for answers oh yes obama will save us from this scary thing that happened he's our daddy like
[1:12:24.840 --> 1:12:30.600]  bush was he will protect us from the dark cult of evil that only feeds on human suffering that's a
[1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:37.960]  quote from bush at the pentagon two days for 9 11 a dark cult of evil talking about themselves
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:45.240]  yes ladies and gentlemen we see what this is it's a devil in disguise
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:52.440]  you look like an angel
[1:12:54.760 --> 1:13:00.440]  walk like an angel talk like an angel
[1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:11.880]  but i got you're the devil in disguise oh yes you are
[1:13:11.880 --> 1:13:24.840]  hmm you fool me with your kisses you cheated and you skimmed heaven knows how you lied to me
[1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:35.560]  you're not the way you seem you look like an angel walk like an angel walk like an angel
[1:13:35.560 --> 1:13:47.560]  walk like an angel talk like an angel but i got you're the devil in disguise oh yes
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:55.080]  you are devil in disguise all right tom in california you're on the air worldwide
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:02.120]  how you doing sir good it's good to talk to you i've listened to your show for uh quite a long
[1:14:02.120 --> 1:14:06.200]  time now i just want to bring another layer to 9 11 that i think would be very interested in
[1:14:06.200 --> 1:14:10.920]  i was a professional airline pilot for 12 years i have over 10 000 hours of flight time all the
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:15.880]  licenses airline transport license etc i was a 747 400 captain for two years for a company called
[1:14:15.880 --> 1:14:21.960]  atlas prior to that i flew the 737 of the captain for seven years i've done a lot of analysts just
[1:14:21.960 --> 1:14:28.840]  i'll bring the airplane component into the mix here for 9 11 back in 2002 2003 actually 2003
[1:14:28.840 --> 1:14:34.520]  they put the remote control takeover chip in it of course well let me know i'll put
[1:14:34.520 --> 1:14:41.240]  hairs even further sir if you look at the amateur video of the 767-200 series aircraft
[1:14:41.240 --> 1:14:46.840]  that did hit that pod that's on the bottom it's called a radome that's manufactured by mark marietta
[1:14:46.840 --> 1:14:51.800]  it's been manufactured here in the united states for 37 years exclusively used by the
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:15:01.480]  u.s military to fly air force drones clearly a control pod clearly that is used only to radio
[1:15:01.480 --> 1:15:07.320]  control aircraft and hide and then can i there are no civilian airplanes that have that pod
[1:15:07.320 --> 1:15:13.960]  period i challenge anybody to go out well look at the e4b's over new york and dc as the attacks
[1:15:13.960 --> 1:15:18.920]  happen and then after they happen when all air traffic is shut down with the command pod on top
[1:15:18.920 --> 1:15:24.280]  and the american flag on back those are the dunes day planes you know and i want to tell you something
[1:15:24.280 --> 1:15:29.640]  when i looked at the amateur video i came across that white 747-100 series and i go what the hell
[1:15:29.640 --> 1:15:35.160]  is that there's no n number on this airplane flying an orbital pattern uh and as we all know
[1:15:35.160 --> 1:15:40.280]  that that airplane was present on that day and i i in a nanosecond i said wait a minute that's a
[1:15:40.280 --> 1:15:45.160]  flying platform where they radio control these airplanes one more piece of information if i may
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:50.360]  and that is it if anybody even has half a brain i know everybody all your listeners do thank god
[1:15:50.360 --> 1:15:55.800]  but the people i talk to who are sheeple and i say to them look it's right in front of your face
[1:15:55.800 --> 1:16:02.680]  you say a 757-200 series hit the pentagon where is the debris field where are the body parts where
[1:16:02.680 --> 1:16:09.080]  are the two 10 000 pound cfm engines uh that are hey on the nasa geographic they say those giant
[1:16:09.080 --> 1:16:15.000]  engines wouldn't even hurt the facade wouldn't even knock a window out but that's exactly my point
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:18.760]  they're not going to bore through six feet of concrete and rebar you're going to have breakaway
[1:16:18.760 --> 1:16:22.680]  bolts just like when the airplane hit the Hudson and the number two engines were off on that air
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:27.720]  bus a310 it said they're they're they're meant to break away from the engine pilot for an engine
[1:16:27.720 --> 1:16:33.240]  fire this is known for airbus blowing doesn't ask a question what would one of those giant engines
[1:16:33.240 --> 1:16:38.760]  weighing i don't know how many tons do at 550 miles an hour smashing into a concrete face i
[1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:47.400]  can tell you that first of all to go 550 miles an hour in airplane and and to for me to hold it down
[1:16:47.400 --> 1:16:53.000]  on the ground is that impossible 60 feet and try and hit a building that that would be very very
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.880]  difficult you have to be an extremely skilled pilot and secondly you're not going to be able to
[1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:02.280]  fly that fast because of air compression so that that's another bogus for those that don't know
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:08.040]  there's there's there's more more more air down close to the ground more water vapor well it's
[1:17:08.040 --> 1:17:12.680]  it's called air compression and i understand the what the the air pressing under the plane's wings
[1:17:13.800 --> 1:17:18.680]  first of all it's just that the air pressure is is denser and it's half as dense at 40 14
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:24.440]  thousand feet but my point is is that it's just it just to go with the speed of sound
[1:17:24.440 --> 1:17:28.520]  and and the the the floating it is that there's no debris field that's the bottom line there's
[1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:32.360]  nothing there and then when i tell people i say look there's nothing there because i'm missile
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:37.960]  hitting uh just one more fight one more point if i may i was present the day of the day after i was
[1:17:37.960 --> 1:17:43.960]  based in jfk when twa flight 800 got shot down by a need to missile and that was the buzz i talked
[1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:49.240]  to an american airline flight crew that was landing on the 25 complex there and saw the freaking thing
[1:17:49.240 --> 1:17:53.640]  it shot out of scott now they've interviewed over a hundred and i think it's 87 members of the
[1:17:53.640 --> 1:17:58.200]  military that said yeah we were running a drill for missile tests that night of course that there's
[1:17:58.200 --> 1:18:04.760]  an area called warning area 105 80 miles northeast you can see it on any aeronautical chart this is
[1:18:04.760 --> 1:18:10.200]  where they were doing that they were shooting that out of a out of a polar submarine and and it had
[1:18:10.200 --> 1:18:17.560]  two forms of uh of uh the primary form of of tracking was its uh radar signature the second
[1:18:17.560 --> 1:18:23.560]  was a heat sinking to signature and that primary uh piece of equipment in that fail and that's
[1:18:23.560 --> 1:18:29.880]  when it tracked and locked on to that that 747 dash uh 200 series airplane and and you know they
[1:18:29.880 --> 1:18:38.360]  found molten metal uh uh on on bodies in that plane i heard this the next day and and i i heard uh
[1:18:38.360 --> 1:18:43.480]  two days after no no they had they had investigators sneak in they later sent him to prison and got
[1:18:43.480 --> 1:18:48.040]  samples and it had explosives residue general benton k parton former head of air force weapons
[1:18:48.040 --> 1:18:53.880]  development said it was a continuous rod warhead missile exactly there was a a you you hit the
[1:18:53.880 --> 1:18:59.400]  nail on the head i read this uh gosh 10 years ago there was a gentleman that wrote book for aviation
[1:18:59.400 --> 1:19:05.720]  space technology which was a 20 year reporter and simply he he said this is this thing she had an
[1:19:05.720 --> 1:19:12.360]  insider go in and take a piece of the back of seat number 33 f and he took that to an independent
[1:19:12.360 --> 1:19:18.840]  lab had it analyzed and found that 99 percent of the exhaust gases on the back of that uh piece of
[1:19:18.840 --> 1:19:24.920]  material matched the certain navy missile and and then he said that of course to uh one of the major
[1:19:24.920 --> 1:19:32.680]  news uh uh agencies and they intercepted it and boom he was in jail but that same day so absolutely
[1:19:32.680 --> 1:19:36.760]  continuous rod warhead when they put the blame back together you can see where it hit all right
[1:19:36.760 --> 1:19:41.240]  thank you so much sir interesting points fits in with all the intel we have you know the first
[1:19:41.240 --> 1:19:47.400]  plane the evidence shows was a drone on the towers as well uh steward new york japa in texas

[1:25:15.880 --> 1:25:24.840]  since 2001 uh my birthday is 9 11 and what you have done this past week uh gives me more hope
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:30.840]  than i ever had of as far as like bringing the real culprits to this event to some kind of justice
[1:25:31.560 --> 1:25:36.440]  that's what we're doing putting it back on the front burner well it needs to be because a lot
[1:25:36.440 --> 1:25:43.000]  of people really still don't know what's going on they heard the uh original explanation and
[1:25:43.000 --> 1:25:48.520]  it had at the time anyway a reasonable amount of plausibility and they left it at that and
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:53.960]  they figure well the government will take care of it and that's that uh you listen to well the
[1:25:53.960 --> 1:25:59.800]  radio stations around here and we're in southeast new york about a hundred miles uh northwest in
[1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:05.400]  new york city and you're hearing oh evil uh osama bin laden uh that's one of the major
[1:26:05.400 --> 1:26:11.240]  topics the other one is they're starting to talk about how uh 9 11 might be made into a national

[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:36.760]  their music because it was talking about world government tyranny i didn't really understand
[1:35:36.760 --> 1:35:41.880]  it when i was listening to it but an instinctive level i did dav is actually a christian and he
[1:35:41.880 --> 1:35:45.960]  exposes the u n in the world government we got him on and i said hey he was familiar with some of
[1:35:45.960 --> 1:35:53.160]  my work when i talked to him off air and i said hey give me an address and i want to send you
[1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:58.040]  my new film endgame it's about a year and a half ago but not about six eight months and he said sure

[1:36:03.400 --> 1:36:07.160]  and roll websites and new sites are saying what is this cover it's a different type of megadeth
[1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:15.400]  cover what is it and it says endgame and it shows people in a death pit in a shooter pit
[1:36:15.400 --> 1:36:20.120]  where they put you in a pit to shoot you and around them are stacked plastic coffins from the
[1:36:20.120 --> 1:36:27.800]  famous fema coffin videos that we've covered here and it's in game and then all these sites

[1:37:19.240 --> 1:37:22.600]  because the good lord above and because the globalists don't want to kill me and highlight
[1:37:22.600 --> 1:37:27.640]  and underline everything i've said and done because they know it's spot on because i've
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:34.040]  done my homework i've studied how they operate i've seen their tricks it's like i'm a hunter
[1:37:34.760 --> 1:37:41.640]  and i've learned what my prey in the info war i've learned their tricks and i have become
[1:37:42.680 --> 1:37:47.000]  pretty good at it i'm certainly not a master no one is a master as you become a master you learn
[1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:56.040]  that you're really not a master but the circle is not yet complete we are still continuing to grow
[1:37:56.040 --> 1:38:04.120]  and doing our work here oh but it is just breathtaking i want to go to steward how we are

[1:38:51.880 --> 1:38:57.160]  amazing i think it's amazing what you and charlie and everybody's doing um i think it's catching
[1:38:57.160 --> 1:39:03.320]  on i was very very excited to see congressman joe wilson stand up and uh you know speak from
[1:39:03.320 --> 1:39:08.840]  truth to power and and point out that obama was lying you know i think it's catching on and people
[1:39:08.840 --> 1:39:15.160]  are seeing a lot of examples of standing up against tyranny and being willing to question and call
[1:39:15.160 --> 1:39:20.280]  things as they are and uh that's exciting it's catching on everywhere and i think it's going
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:29.960]  to continue to do so well you're just doing a great job steward uh what are you reflecting
[1:39:29.960 --> 1:39:35.800]  on this 911 is what is we are changed la doing well we've got a big street action out of the

[1:40:00.680 --> 1:40:07.080]  space and we're trying to take every opportunity we can to get the truth out and to show people
[1:40:07.080 --> 1:40:12.600]  perhaps more importantly than the facts and evidence that we can stand up with those facts
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:17.880]  and evidence that is on our side and truth and and everything that's good is on our side and
[1:40:17.880 --> 1:40:22.040]  we're just standing up every chance we get and more people are joining us and it's great to see
[1:40:23.000 --> 1:40:27.400]  i do want to go ahead and talk about an observation since you brought up senator
[1:40:27.400 --> 1:40:35.240]  john rockefeller goes by j it appears in the last six months or so the mantle of power from the 94
[1:40:35.240 --> 1:40:41.160]  year old david rockefeller who is definitely at the very top of the pyramid with the queen of england
[1:40:41.160 --> 1:40:46.040]  and the queen of the netherlands along with lord rothchild but those those four people are at are
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:54.120]  at the pinnacle at the paramount level that the mantle is being passed as we speak from the 94
[1:40:54.120 --> 1:41:02.840]  year old david rockefeller maybe 95 now two senator j rockefeller of the dynasty and he is the guy
[1:41:02.840 --> 1:41:07.080]  haunt showing the cyber security takeover of the web openly announcing it's the in free speech and
[1:41:07.080 --> 1:41:11.560]  take it over he's the one haunt showing the expansion of homeland security and brigade homeland
[1:41:11.560 --> 1:41:17.560]  400 000 troops to operate inside the us he is the one haunt showing the new wars he is the one
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:22.440]  haunt showing the new eugenics operations he is the one admittedly that is giving the game plan
[1:41:22.440 --> 1:41:28.520]  and marching orders to obama he is now eclipsed kissinger and david rockefeller and i will now
[1:41:28.520 --> 1:41:35.320]  list him as the head of the united states the true governor of north america is j rockefeller i've
[1:41:35.320 --> 1:41:40.040]  been meaning to say this the last few months but i wanted to be sure but now the true governor of
[1:41:40.040 --> 1:41:47.240]  north america and probably this entire hemisphere uh is j rockefeller and you you confronted the
[1:41:47.240 --> 1:41:51.240]  supreme leader you and lucrodowski did a fabulous job along with other we are changers we're going
[1:41:51.240 --> 1:41:57.960]  to be putting that in uh fall the republic and the eugenics section uh but uh just absolutely
[1:41:57.960 --> 1:42:03.640]  amazing job you were there in congress tell folks briefly about the documentation on thermite the
[1:42:03.640 --> 1:42:09.080]  thermetical explosive devices in the towers and what you delivered to congress well we delivered
[1:42:09.080 --> 1:42:14.360]  them a package a pretty uh pretty inclusive package that had the thermate papers it had the
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:20.120]  links between the nist and nano thermate it had a cover letter uh letting them know that it was time
[1:42:20.120 --> 1:42:25.400]  for them to stand up and side with the truth and to look at this information they can no longer
[1:42:25.400 --> 1:42:31.400]  hide behind plausible deniability that was no longer possible and we were documenting all this
[1:42:31.400 --> 1:42:36.680]  and putting it in their hands and it's just uh we're making it harder and harder for them to
[1:42:36.680 --> 1:42:43.800]  stand behind this hoax and uh it's an amazing thing to see the reaction that we get from these
[1:42:43.800 --> 1:42:48.920]  people and and to have them on record because their hopes is falling apart at the house of cards
[1:42:48.920 --> 1:42:53.720]  and now that there's so many different viewing angles into this through the financial collapse
[1:42:53.720 --> 1:42:58.360]  through the swine flu hoax through the hoax war on pair through all this great information you
[1:42:58.360 --> 1:43:05.720]  guys are showcasing with charlie about 9 11 people are beginning to be willing to look at the
[1:43:05.720 --> 1:43:11.480]  totality of the situation and see that there are other people addressing it squarely and that's
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:16.760]  what we put in congress's hands the information and a cover letter stating that we the people
[1:43:16.760 --> 1:43:20.920]  expect them to address this squarely and if they do we stand with them
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:28.680]  well it's exciting it's exciting what you're doing uh continue to tell us about what we are
[1:43:28.680 --> 1:43:34.360]  changes up to well you know we're we're working with the police uh we're working with the
[1:43:34.360 --> 1:43:40.040]  oathkeepers we're basically looking for every chance we can to get in front of uh you know
[1:43:40.040 --> 1:43:46.440]  notable people and ask real questions as politely as we can to bring some reality
[1:43:46.440 --> 1:43:53.960]  to uh you know to this puppet show and everything that we can do we are doing we we're always looking
[1:43:53.960 --> 1:44:00.200]  for opportunities we've got a lot of ongoing things uh you know in the works and we're we know
[1:44:00.200 --> 1:44:04.760]  we're just kind of hitting it from every angle we can we've got a lot of uh diverse people in the
[1:44:04.760 --> 1:44:10.120]  group and right now we're really reaching out to law enforcement and military with oathkeepers
[1:44:10.120 --> 1:44:15.400]  as best we can that's very important right now you know to uh to let these people know that we
[1:44:15.400 --> 1:44:21.160]  stand with them and bear with us that we're on the same page and to try to stop uh this attempt
[1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:27.800]  to divide the people from the police the people from the military and government and absolutely
[1:44:28.760 --> 1:44:33.720]  yeah we're trying to you know we're trying to let them know that we're not kooks we're trying to
[1:44:34.440 --> 1:44:39.160]  you know let them know that we're just thoughtful patriotic americans that are standing with the
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:43.800]  principles that built this country well look steward look steward six of the ten commission
[1:44:43.800 --> 1:44:47.880]  members say it was a fraud and criminal and a cover-up and it should be criminally investigated
[1:44:47.880 --> 1:44:53.560]  not just a new congressional investigation and so when you're when the president appoints a commission
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:57.240]  and they say it's a fraud and you're not supposed to talk about it and bill o'reilly gets up and
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:45:01.000]  sean hannity gets up and say oh they're just hurting the families when most of the families
[1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:05.160]  and the heads of the groups have been on this show saying they think it's an inside job it is a hoax
[1:45:05.160 --> 1:45:12.040]  and it's coming down it is it very much isn't go ahead no no i i want to keep you there but i want
[1:45:12.040 --> 1:45:19.400]  to bring up mark dice of mark dice dot com who is again a great activist for liberty and freedom
[1:45:19.400 --> 1:45:23.560]  the author of the resistance manifesto that we incidentally carry both of his books that he's
[1:45:23.560 --> 1:45:28.200]  written that info wars dot com on the bookstore folks want to find out more about mark dice there
[1:45:28.200 --> 1:45:33.720]  at info wars dot com mark has reached tens of millions of people calling into limbaugh calling
[1:45:33.720 --> 1:45:41.000]  into beck calling in to um savage calling in to just just scores of different shows and he has a
[1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:45.960]  lot of those hundreds of those calls linked upon a site he is now called into lord limbaugh
[1:45:46.600 --> 1:45:51.000]  and successfully gotten lord limbaugh to talk about it to his 22 million listeners so that's
[1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:56.520]  the power of just taking action taking the gloves off and getting in the info war and i salute you
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:46:03.000]  and commend you um mark dice mark let's bring you up well thank you and i couldn't sit idly by on
[1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:07.800]  this eighth anniversary and do nothing so i uh instead of getting involved in a march my uh
[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:12.280]  mornings have been consisted of trying to get through to these clowns so that sitting here at
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:18.360]  my desk i could speak to millions of people and i luckily was able to get through to rush limbaugh
[1:46:18.360 --> 1:46:22.120]  this morning the audio is being posted i don't know if it's good enough to play on the air it was
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:28.440]  very brief but i i did slam him uh and ask him what his and and his establishment friends are
[1:46:28.440 --> 1:46:34.520]  going to do now that the uh propaganda and gatekeeping that they've been attempting to do is not
[1:46:34.520 --> 1:46:40.680]  successful and over a third of americans on both political spears uh see the attack as an inside
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:45.800]  job and he the call was immediately dropped it it did make it out on the air and i he did mention
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:51.000]  charlie sheen's letter and i think rush is under the impression that charlie actually met with him
[1:46:51.000 --> 1:46:55.720]  and he said that oh i read the transcript of you know sheen's interview and if the head kook
[1:46:56.360 --> 1:47:02.600]  meaning obama doesn't agree with us uh then we're really uh just a bunch of kooks and he went off
[1:47:02.600 --> 1:47:08.600]  to say that a third of the country is completely insane and that he uh has no hope of ever reaching
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:14.840]  us but he's just trying to minimize the insanity so it's just obvious that everybody now knows
[1:47:14.840 --> 1:47:20.200]  or the majority of people see what's going on and if you look at the the positive pieces that
[1:47:20.200 --> 1:47:24.520]  have come out from charlie sheen's request it's incredible because people that work at fox and
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:31.400]  fox news and roiders and other news agencies actually wrote positive and fair pieces about it
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:37.000]  because i think that the writers are are on our side a lot of these people are and if the gatekeepers
[1:47:37.000 --> 1:47:42.200]  uh can't kill the pieces before they get on out to the public i think that they're doing their
[1:47:42.200 --> 1:47:47.800]  best to try to present our viewpoint and get it out there because now it's been eight years of people
[1:47:47.800 --> 1:47:52.600]  hammering and and it's a safe environment to talk about such issues and i just want to thank
[1:47:52.600 --> 1:47:57.480]  everyone for you know everyone who's wanted to know the truth who spoke the truth who's helped
[1:47:57.480 --> 1:48:02.680]  to educate their friends and their families and i think that we have had a bigger impact than we
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:09.320]  than we think we had although we need to continue uh just down the course absolutely
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:14.440]  briefly tell listeners how they can call into these big international national shows and reach
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:19.880]  millions of people it's not that hard it's not hard here's the secret and sean hannity is going
[1:48:19.880 --> 1:48:25.880]  to be coming up check your time zone he's coming up at noon live uh that's pacific time you can
[1:48:25.880 --> 1:48:30.680]  check the phone numbers on their own website to call in here's how you do it you need to call
[1:48:30.680 --> 1:48:35.880]  right at the top of the hour when the show starts or even a few minutes beforehand before they give
[1:48:35.880 --> 1:48:41.640]  the phone number out uh you have to get the phone number from the website start calling five minutes
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:49.480]  before the show even goes live get in the call bank and feed them a typical left versus right
[1:48:49.480 --> 1:48:54.920]  question that the screener is going to think is going to help to perpetuate the ideology and the
[1:48:54.920 --> 1:49:03.400]  paradigm that the talk show is designed to do so i fed rush limbo's screener a nice question got him
[1:49:03.400 --> 1:49:10.760]  the call bank it was going to help to perpetuate his philosophy of course and then as soon as i was
[1:49:10.760 --> 1:49:17.640]  live i just asked my real question and that's how you do it and i think that if we do this just
[1:49:17.640 --> 1:49:22.760]  imagine if you keep hearing this over and over if you're not enlightened to these ideas and you're
[1:49:22.760 --> 1:49:27.080]  listening to your your idol shan hanity and you just keep hearing these phone calls and people
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:33.320]  mentioning operation northwoods and liquid metal in the towers and charlie sheen demanding a
[1:49:33.880 --> 1:49:38.920]  of meeting with obama millions of people are going to go and google those issues and they're
[1:49:38.920 --> 1:49:44.200]  going to start to find the rabbit hole that we've all found and that's sort of been one of the ways
[1:49:44.200 --> 1:49:49.800]  that i've been able to reach so many people is is by doing that it takes a lot of patience
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:56.760]  you may have to hit redial for 15 or 20 minutes once you get on hold if you get through the call
[1:49:56.760 --> 1:50:02.680]  screener into the queue you may have to sit on hold for an hour before your call goes live before
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:09.000]  he goes to your call so i do it uh from from my home phone and i put it on speakerphone and i sit
[1:50:09.000 --> 1:50:13.160]  there and i surf the web and then when he goes to my call i pick up the phone and i and i just hit
[1:50:13.160 --> 1:50:19.720]  them with the real question and uh shock them and if you plug a website maybe it'll get out
[1:50:19.720 --> 1:50:25.320]  i've found that if you plug issues and and just bring up statements and questions it has a lot
[1:50:25.960 --> 1:50:31.000]  more successful uh percentage of getting out on the air without them using the seven second delay
[1:50:32.760 --> 1:50:39.080]  well done mark dice and we'll play that audio soon as you get it uh posted up stay there i want to
[1:50:39.080 --> 1:50:44.040]  see by to both of you and get final comments from stewart howe or change la and also hailing from

[1:54:24.920 --> 1:54:32.920]  oh bad bad and then shaney got caught wanting to blow up us ships the navy seals attacking them
[1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:37.080]  it came out that right at the time he wanted to do that those radio transmissions came in
[1:54:37.080 --> 1:54:42.040]  telling the destroyers they were going to blow them up turned out it was not iran doing it and
[1:54:42.040 --> 1:54:47.080]  then it was an english speaker doing it the media said oh somebody just joking around the radio
[1:54:47.080 --> 1:54:55.000]  like today with the ships like today in the Potomac gentlemen uh do you see through this thing or
[1:54:55.000 --> 1:54:59.640]  did you agree with me this is a total scyop with obama saying how dare you on 9-11 scare everyone
[1:54:59.640 --> 1:55:07.560]  cnn well obviously i think we're all suspecting that something was going to happen some sort of
[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:13.560]  fear mongering reminding everyone of the the bogeyman that uh they're using to scare everyone so
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:19.400]  of course it's no coincidence that it's clear it's on the potomac it's close to dc um they
[1:55:19.400 --> 1:55:26.040]  know what the facts will come out but of course since we know this issue is one of a string of
[1:55:26.040 --> 1:55:32.440]  propaganda it it doesn't surprise it's their mo it's like a duck quacking it's what they do
[1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:37.000]  and it's like air force one photo op triggers panic in manhattan turned out they engineered all that
[1:55:37.000 --> 1:55:42.920]  when i think the reason why we haven't had a real attack or any real terrorists
[1:55:43.560 --> 1:55:47.880]  after the september 11th attacks for the last eight years is really because of the audience
[1:55:47.880 --> 1:55:53.720]  because everybody now has been so aware or somebody everybody knows somebody that's in
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:58.440]  the truth movement and if anything actually did happen if there was a major attack again
[1:55:59.080 --> 1:56:03.960]  i think they fear the repercussions from the public i think they know we're watching we're
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:09.640]  watching the magician now we know it's fake yeah so they've moved on to economic terrorism and
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:13.960]  bioterrorism and scaring everyone that they're going to get sick with the new bog it's a little
[1:56:13.960 --> 1:56:21.080]  bit more difficult to trace uh i agree but they've been trying to rehabilitate their 9-11 fraud
[1:56:21.080 --> 1:56:26.280]  to stage more attacks let me get steward house comment on that yeah i think they'll look for
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:33.800]  every opportunity uh to manufacture the boogeyman you know to uh to prop up something as an enemy
[1:56:33.800 --> 1:56:40.200]  the real or imagined uh you know to to justify everything that they're doing and you know people
[1:56:40.200 --> 1:56:44.520]  are catching on as mark said as you always point out people are catching on and we're taking away

[2:00:39.960 --> 2:00:44.520]  but we're gonna get a quick economic update from bob chapman the international forecaster
[2:00:45.560 --> 2:00:53.240]  right now bob i just can't do this horn enough he said six eight months ago and i read the
[2:00:53.240 --> 2:00:59.080]  newsletter we posted up on info wars.com excerpts of it every week comes out twice a week he said
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:03.560]  no they're going to run the market back up to near its previous levels and then drop it again
[2:01:04.280 --> 2:01:09.320]  early fall i mean this guy's got a crystal ball and he said just a few weeks ago he goes you
[2:01:09.320 --> 2:01:15.160]  better get out of the stock market it's going to be going down and he talked about how gold by the
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:21.560]  early fall would go above a thousand when back when it was 890 and here we are at uh 1013 last
[2:01:21.560 --> 2:01:26.120]  time i checked a few hours ago i don't know what it is now uh but it is just wild and we have open
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:31.800]  announcements and ap Reuters new bank of the world global carbon taxes to fund it the dollar is going
[2:01:31.800 --> 2:01:35.720]  to be like argentine soon top economist i'm not saying that's going to happen they're saying it
[2:01:36.280 --> 2:01:42.040]  so we see a shift now to them stampeding people and saying you got to accept world
[2:01:42.040 --> 2:01:49.560]  government only it will save you bob chapman what in hades is going on i think it's exactly
[2:01:49.560 --> 2:01:55.000]  what you're saying alex is that uh you ought to be happy that we're going to form a new currency
[2:01:55.000 --> 2:02:01.080]  so that you all won't be out of out of luck when in fact is they're using the the dollar's collapse
[2:02:01.080 --> 2:02:07.160]  as an excuse along with a number of other things and you know the un never says anything
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:14.200]  about the dollar or currencies or gold it's highly unusual and so there's obviously a concentrated
[2:02:14.200 --> 2:02:19.240]  effort to get people to think that they need a new currency they may need a new currency
[2:02:19.240 --> 2:02:24.760]  for trade but for trade only i mean if the dollar is going to get down versus other major currencies
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:30.680]  that's fine it deserves to go down it's a free market well at least partially free market our
[2:02:30.680 --> 2:02:35.960]  government is in there all the time uh doing things that they shouldn't be doing but the point is
[2:02:36.440 --> 2:02:42.120]  that the dollar's headed lower the market's going to start to get down soon we've already broken a
[2:02:42.120 --> 2:02:50.280]  thousand not as good as when you last look it's a 105 uh 1 005 60 it's gyrating that's good
[2:02:51.640 --> 2:02:58.040]  what's that it's gyrating it's gyrating and that's normal especially on a friday because
[2:02:58.040 --> 2:03:03.560]  you often see both in gold and silver and other things like golden silver shares or regular
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:09.240]  shares people take profits on friday uh they don't want to be long or short over the weekend
[2:03:09.240 --> 2:03:15.560]  very often so it's not unusual but it was a very good day very good week and so gold has broken out
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:22.120]  gold is going to go higher and uh it's a very very very strong indication and of course the
[2:03:22.120 --> 2:03:28.600]  technical aspects of this is a reverse head and shoulders and the right hand uh uh part of the
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:35.480]  shoulder uh that you can see when you look at it visually it's broken out and usually they'll spike
[2:03:35.480 --> 2:03:43.080]  and it'll either go to 1200 or 1700 somewhere up in there and that's quite a move and so the people
[2:03:43.080 --> 2:03:48.520]  who are long golden silver coins are going to do quite well and of course bullion and shares as well
[2:03:48.520 --> 2:03:55.640]  but the point here is that they are conjuring up under this cover of the dollar and other things
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:04:01.080]  that they want another currency and they're going to keep it up and keep it up and keep it up and
[2:04:01.080 --> 2:04:05.720]  sooner or later they're going to try it and so don't be surprised that's what they're after
[2:04:09.000 --> 2:04:14.200]  well bob so i mean do you agree with all these top economists saying and i mean they wouldn't
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:18.520]  be putting them in the newspaper saying we're going to see an argentine situation in the next
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:23.400]  few years for the dollar unless the establishment at some level wants that to happen or i mean what's
[2:04:23.400 --> 2:04:30.920]  behind that well i think they want to forewarn you that they were candid with you and telling you
[2:04:30.920 --> 2:04:36.840]  that this in fact is going to going to happen and it probably is going to happen uh i've been
[2:04:36.840 --> 2:04:43.000]  saying out two and a half years maybe two years maybe less that we're going to have a official
[2:04:43.000 --> 2:04:50.920]  default and and and default um and uh and stay there stay there we got a break but yes i remember
[2:04:50.920 --> 2:04:56.440]  you a year and a half ago going no alex it's going to happen in two and a half to three years
[2:04:56.440 --> 2:04:59.480]  and now we're a year and a half into it and it looks like bob's right as usual

[2:08:02.440 --> 2:08:09.000]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[2:08:09.000 --> 2:08:12.200]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[2:08:16.920 --> 2:08:20.360]  charlie it's great to be here with you um appreciate you i know in the center of you
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:26.200]  likewise alex thank you why after three years of silence concerning 9-11 uh are you now speaking
[2:08:26.200 --> 2:08:35.080]  up and why have you written this public letter that you've now published well alex uh i wrote
[2:08:35.080 --> 2:08:42.680]  this letter for for two reasons uh firstly i i i wanted to create a public document specifically
[2:08:42.680 --> 2:08:49.640]  rooted in fact uh if anybody dares question that i i i would encourage those people to to
[2:08:49.640 --> 2:08:57.080]  to scrutinize it to research it uh that the truth is unchanging alex as we don't know uh
[2:08:57.080 --> 2:09:02.040]  the only aspect of this piece that that had to be manufactured with the president's words
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:09.080]  everything else will withstand the critical assault i'm more than prepared to endure and
[2:09:09.080 --> 2:09:14.840]  secondly um this is our first new president since 9 11 and they consequently his first
[2:09:14.840 --> 2:09:24.760]  9 11 anniversary in office um enough stonewalling enough media manipulation enough media mantra
[2:09:24.760 --> 2:09:31.800]  speak the families deserve better alex america deserves better i mean come on come on people
[2:09:31.800 --> 2:09:39.080]  the 9 11 commission report is a blatant work of manipulation secrecy and fiction come on the time
[2:09:39.080 --> 2:09:46.120]  is now demand the truth i personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a
[2:09:46.120 --> 2:09:51.000]  uh the new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our congress we
[2:09:51.000 --> 2:09:55.960]  have to take action we have to stand as one we must insist that our new president deliver on his
[2:09:55.960 --> 2:10:01.800]  promises all right that's charlie sheen from my taped interview with him in 20 minutes he's
[2:10:01.800 --> 2:10:05.400]  going to be live with us here on air we're going to bob up for a full hour next week
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:10.520]  because i really want to get into the economy with him we've got this limbaugh club of him talking
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:14.360]  about it today it's kind of hammered audio but we're going to play it in about 10 minutes when
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:21.640]  bob leaves us uh but again 33 after bottom of this hour we're going to go to charlie sheen live here
[2:10:21.640 --> 2:10:27.960]  on air uh bob i want to get your comments on what charlie and i are doing and the american people
[2:10:27.960 --> 2:10:32.760]  people the world are doing right now kind of our sigh up against the globalist but before we do that
[2:10:32.760 --> 2:10:40.120]  finishing up clearly then do you believe they're deciding to abandon the dollar the chinese are
[2:10:40.120 --> 2:10:45.400]  saying they may abandon the dollar what is happening right now why is gold shot up to above uh
[2:10:45.400 --> 2:10:52.520]  thousand 13 today flight to quality uh yes they are afraid of the abandoning of the dollar because
[2:10:52.520 --> 2:10:57.800]  people don't see much if any inflation at all so that can be the only reason why it's up and i think
[2:10:57.800 --> 2:11:04.840]  as i said before down the line and i don't know how far six months two and a half years i don't know
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:10.600]  i do know that they are going to devalue the dollar officially and they're going to default
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:16.680]  simultaneously at some meeting like the smithsoni and they had in the early 70s or the plaza record
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:22.200]  they had 85 in paris and there's going to be revaluation and devaluations currency against
[2:11:22.200 --> 2:11:28.920]  currency and i think there's going to be a a a debt default of perhaps two-thirds of debt
[2:11:28.920 --> 2:11:34.840]  of all of those who are in debt to clean the whole mess up and at the same time i think
[2:11:34.840 --> 2:11:42.120]  what they want to do what they should do for international trade is a 20 nation international
[2:11:42.120 --> 2:11:52.360]  unit uh made up of all those currencies plus a 10 percent balance of gold within that unit and it
[2:11:52.360 --> 2:11:57.160]  will be perfectly acceptable for trade now bob let's explain people people are going to spend
[2:11:57.160 --> 2:12:03.640]  this saying bob chatman's with a straw man argument bob chatman's calling for global currency no
[2:12:03.640 --> 2:12:09.160]  they're killing the dollar they've hoarded out they've maxed it out they run up our credit cards
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:14.680]  our national credit card to 1.5 quadrillion according to many economists and so now they
[2:12:14.680 --> 2:12:19.640]  want to have a new global tyrannical currency you're saying for global trade there will be a
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:26.600]  world reserve currency let's make sure it's a free and fair one uh so so you're talking real
[2:12:26.600 --> 2:12:33.560]  world ballgame here not fantasy land and then second of all they'll come along later how much
[2:12:33.560 --> 2:12:39.080]  later i don't know and i'll say well gee that worked really well now let's have a world currency
[2:12:39.080 --> 2:12:44.120]  that's how i think they're gonna slide into it and i've been saying this from you know months as
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:49.320]  you well know and three months ago you said that they would announce that made off had cancer
[2:12:49.320 --> 2:12:56.040]  and now they've floated that out there how did you know that was gonna happen um i i i had some
[2:12:56.040 --> 2:13:01.480]  information from other people but i backed into it as well uh the next thing is he'll have a card
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:07.720]  attack supposedly be taken out and buried and probably end up uh at the hands of the plastic
[2:13:07.720 --> 2:13:12.120]  surgeon so he can go and live in israel a paraguay or wherever they're gonna put them
[2:13:14.120 --> 2:13:17.960]  well kin lay we mean we know that was staged that's even come out in foreign news
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:25.560]  that's right and uh then we have the uh the young man timothy mcbay who supposedly was uh
[2:13:25.560 --> 2:13:31.480]  uh executed uh i i have my doubts about that as well well local reporter said is he was breathing
[2:13:31.480 --> 2:13:37.800]  when they took him out well there you go and i i think uh that they take these tables to other
[2:13:37.800 --> 2:13:42.680]  destinations and they live happily ever after now when you were working in black ops against the
[2:13:42.680 --> 2:13:48.040]  soviets i mean i've read even 50 years ago they took large portions of special forces and would
[2:13:48.040 --> 2:13:52.760]  even stage their deaths or change their names give them plastic surgery change their ears their
[2:13:52.760 --> 2:13:58.920]  nose that's declassified so why wouldn't they do that with made-off or kin lay i mean that's what
[2:13:58.920 --> 2:14:03.960]  they do in the witness protection program they stage the deaths a lot that's right and so i think
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:08.280]  that's the way this is gone they take care of their own that's the way they do it if you step
[2:14:08.280 --> 2:14:14.360]  out of line you know you get assassinated but uh you know this program you've got coming up on
[2:14:14.360 --> 2:14:21.320]  charlie sheen um i knew charlie when he lived in malibu and and i'm very happy to see he
[2:14:21.320 --> 2:14:28.840]  has attained the the intellectual abilities that he has uh my my kids grew up uh at the same time
[2:14:28.840 --> 2:14:33.560]  he did and i knew his father quite well martin because i used to go to church with him all the
[2:14:33.560 --> 2:14:41.640]  time and so i'm very happy to see charlie come out and uh and he was always a gutsy kid uh always

[2:16:01.000 --> 2:16:10.760]  that's 877 479 8178 all right we got about two or three minutes left here um bob
[2:16:10.760 --> 2:16:17.960]  bob in closing what do you see happening in the fall uh i see uh terrible things with the dollar
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:25.720]  going down to 71 18 on the usdx i see great consternation and turmoil uh over the swine
[2:16:25.720 --> 2:16:32.440]  flu uh shots um the government as you know has been experimenting on our on our military people
[2:16:32.440 --> 2:16:38.840]  and a lot of them gotten pretty sick um i think october's going to be a giant horrible month and
[2:16:38.840 --> 2:16:44.440]  i think the stock market will start back down again too and a lot of what uh well balmer is
[2:16:44.440 --> 2:16:50.360]  doing on television is generated in the direction of calming people for the storm that they see
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:56.360]  coming ahead and his next speech is going to be about the economy the economy is in dreadful shape
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:00.920]  and it might you know go sideways for the next year but if they don't add another two trillion
[2:17:00.920 --> 2:17:05.400]  dollars or the banks don't start lending it's over so that's what they're going to do you're
[2:17:05.400 --> 2:17:09.560]  going to see and i predicted this last january you're going to see them come up with another
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:15.320]  stimulus plan next year to make sure all these democrats get back in office or i shouldn't say
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:20.280]  it that way i should say everybody who's in office gets back in that's what it's all about
[2:17:20.920 --> 2:17:29.640]  and uh so i think that's what's going to happen well you're absolutely uh absolutely on target
[2:17:29.640 --> 2:17:35.320]  over and over again bob will continue to watch this unfold i think it's key that as the global
[2:17:35.320 --> 2:17:40.280] ists implode the economy by design we continue to say audit the fed these are the people that
[2:17:40.280 --> 2:17:44.680]  engineered the collapse these are the individuals creating a global ponzi scheme that they want to
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:50.200]  panic us into the next phase of accepting world government no we must indict the bankers as ron
[2:17:50.200 --> 2:17:55.640]  paul said on the show we must go after the globalist we must bring them to justice and just start
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:18:00.120]  identifying the shadow government and the deep state and the private offshore corporate criminal
[2:18:00.120 --> 2:18:04.600]  networks that are engaged in the global corporate takeover known as the new world order and if we
[2:18:04.600 --> 2:18:09.960]  just continue to hammer that in and get the word out over 75 of americans in a gallup poll
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:14.440]  want to audit or abolish the fed or both so we're beginning to have more and more victories and
[2:18:14.440 --> 2:18:19.400]  people that wouldn't listen to us 10 20 30 years ago 45 years ago when you first got started
[2:18:19.400 --> 2:18:23.720]  they're now listening now and it's all because of people like you bob Chapman and all the fighters
[2:18:23.720 --> 2:18:28.840]  out there so everything you do folks is part of this incremental battle many hands make light work
[2:18:28.840 --> 2:18:32.600]  bob Chapman thank you so much for spending time with us i want to do a full hour with you next
[2:18:32.600 --> 2:18:38.840]  week can you do that absolutely and thank you for having me again and we are winning we've got

[2:19:06.920 --> 2:19:11.720]  able to play to analyze it it's bad audio but it's the best we got somebody sent it to us

[2:20:00.440 --> 2:20:04.120]  sir for calling nice to have you here with us thanks rush i'm wondering what you and your
[2:20:04.120 --> 2:20:09.000]  establishment friends are going to do now that over one third of americans from both political
[2:20:09.000 --> 2:20:15.560]  parties believe that the attacks of 9 11 were an inside job and your propaganda and your gatekeeping
[2:20:15.560 --> 2:20:20.840]  is not having the effect that you uh and your puppet masters thought it would well you know
[2:20:20.840 --> 2:20:26.680]  something mark what that tells me is that we're losing one third of the country to a bunch of
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:33.800]  insane a little physics and 9 11 was an inside job i saw an interview mark with charlie sheen
[2:20:33.800 --> 2:20:38.760]  charlie sheen got 20 minutes with barack obama i read the transcript and charlie sheen said hey
[2:20:38.760 --> 2:20:42.280]  president the president don't you realize that levels inside job and obama didn't want to go
[2:20:42.280 --> 2:20:48.120]  to everybody if you can't get if you can't get the leader of your cooks to go along with what
[2:20:48.120 --> 2:20:58.520]  you cooks believe then i would say that you've got a cook cause 9 11 an inside job i um i fear for a
[2:20:58.520 --> 2:21:03.320]  country because of such insanity and i've talked about the fact that we're two or three countries
[2:21:03.320 --> 2:21:11.080]  today and i have no illusion that i have any ability to reach the insane i have no ability
[2:21:11.080 --> 2:21:19.800]  that i have any sway over lunatics uh and frankly i don't even try uh what i'm trying to do is make
[2:21:19.800 --> 2:21:27.880]  sure that the number of lunatics the numbers of the genuinely politically insane remain as small
[2:21:27.880 --> 2:21:34.200]  as one third so that you will forever remain the stupid idiot minority that uh that you are
[2:21:34.200 --> 2:21:44.920]  you know something folks if if george bush were president today let's say it's 2007 and it's the
[2:21:44.920 --> 2:21:51.080]  sixth anniversary of 9 11 and if george bush were president remember now the iraq war still
[2:21:51.080 --> 2:21:58.760]  going on coming up on the on the surge and this training exercise it happened do you think and
[2:21:58.760 --> 2:22:03.000]  bush was let's say everything's the same except bush is present he's at the pentagon he's doing
[2:22:03.000 --> 2:22:10.760]  a memorial at the pentagon and the coast guard runs his training exercise uh you know what the
[2:22:10.760 --> 2:22:16.360]  drive buys would report that bush faked and staged and purposely did this exercise to scare everybody
[2:22:16.360 --> 2:22:20.600]  to death to realize we have real problems to get everybody's trying to support a rock they would
[2:22:20.600 --> 2:22:27.640]  say that bush was behind it your lunatic friends mark your kook in saniax that would be your take
[2:22:27.640 --> 2:22:34.280]  on it what do we get today oh no oh no cnn oh no the information here about the same as the one
[2:22:34.280 --> 2:22:44.200]  of the hot day wed them to the most embarrassing hour or two of reporting probably this week for
[2:22:44.200 --> 2:22:51.320]  cnn i mean you have to categorize cnn's embarrassments by the week not even no warning signs that i'm
[2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:55.560]  aware of the city and it was a revelation that the white house had no intention of making public
[2:22:55.560 --> 2:23:01.080]  president bush was told in august that osama bin laden might be planning an attack in bobby
[2:23:01.080 --> 2:23:05.800]  the hijack could have predicted nobody our government at least uh august six uh pvd i believe
[2:23:05.800 --> 2:23:12.440]  the title was bin laden determined to attack inside the united states 70 percent of family
[2:23:12.440 --> 2:23:16.760]  members questions were never answered during the 9-11 commission report these happen and
[2:23:16.760 --> 2:23:21.400]  thomas kain said they were set up to fail i mean i remember the commission it's a scam it's absolutely
[2:23:21.400 --> 2:23:31.640]  disgusting the questions mr president the questions building seven ablaze at the moment and apparently
[2:23:31.640 --> 2:23:37.720]  getting ready to collapse building seven freefall collapse well no there's never seven coming down
[2:23:38.280 --> 2:23:43.640]  the excitement and the fun the people get watching an old building being demolished and
[2:23:43.640 --> 2:23:47.480]  they wired very carefully for days and it's a very careful operation third time today
[2:23:47.480 --> 2:23:53.240]  it's reminiscent of those pictures revolting too much on television before when a building
[2:23:53.240 --> 2:23:58.280]  was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down this minus thing to do is
[2:23:58.280 --> 2:24:05.400]  is pull it uh and they made that decision to pull and then we watched the building collapse jane what
[2:24:05.400 --> 2:24:10.040]  more can you tell us about the salomon brother's building and its collapse well only really what
[2:24:10.040 --> 2:24:14.680]  you already know details are very very sketchy you're getting information now that one of the
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:20.760]  other buildings building seven in the world trade center complex is on fire and has either collapsed
[2:24:20.760 --> 2:24:31.320]  or is collapsing the pentagon vanishing airplane my close-up inspection there's no evidence of a
[2:24:31.320 --> 2:24:37.160]  plane having crashed anywhere near the pentagon the only site is the actual side of the building
[2:24:37.160 --> 2:24:42.440]  that's crashed in and as i said the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you
[2:24:42.440 --> 2:24:48.520]  could pick up in your hand uh there are no large tail sections wing sections a fuselage nothing
[2:24:48.520 --> 2:24:53.560]  like that anywhere around which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:25:02.360]  pentagon firefighters and police describing explosions a lot of them the secondary explosion
[2:25:02.360 --> 2:25:07.000]  we've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion this floor by floor instead
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:13.320]  of popping out it was like it was different definitely yeah they were planned to take down a building
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:17.800]  looks sort of like the building just demolished even if there was no secondary explosives in the
[2:25:17.800 --> 2:25:22.840]  building like gunfire you know bang bang bang bang and then and then all of a sudden three big
[2:25:22.840 --> 2:25:28.120]  explosions do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse to me it sounded
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:35.560]  like it to me it sounded like an explosion chief albert terry told me that he tried to get his men
[2:25:35.560 --> 2:25:40.120]  out as quickly as he could but he said that there was another explosion which took place
[2:25:40.120 --> 2:25:45.400]  and then an hour after there was a another explosion in one of the towers here
[2:25:49.000 --> 2:25:55.560]  sabelle edmunds fbi translator breaking her gag order all our intimate relationship with
[2:25:55.560 --> 2:26:02.840]  bin laden and and taliban we did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the
[2:26:02.840 --> 2:26:09.240]  way up to september 11 bin laden was spirited into this military hospital in rao apendi for kidney
[2:26:09.240 --> 2:26:14.120]  dialysis treatment the military had him surrounded they were saying that Osama bin laden had to be
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:21.160]  watched carefully and looked after nor had standing down or were the planes
[2:26:24.600 --> 2:26:29.480]  on now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9 11 a mysterious plane was seen flying
[2:26:29.480 --> 2:26:35.320]  right over the president's resident e4b is over new york and washington otherwise known as the
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:41.400]  doomsday planes has never been officially explained cell phones working at impossible altitudes
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:50.040]  solicitor general ted olson receiving phone calls that the fbi says were never made what happened
[2:26:50.040 --> 2:26:57.160]  during that call this is the only information we have on these terrorists she was able to call
[2:26:57.160 --> 2:27:03.560]  him twice how she could pull that off we don't know but she did these are the questions mr president
[2:27:04.440 --> 2:27:07.720]  these are the questions they go on and on
[2:27:11.800 --> 2:27:17.960]  good afternoon mr president i come to you today representing the families of the victims of september
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:24.760]  11 as well as millions of my fellow americans hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my
[2:27:24.760 --> 2:27:31.560]  letter to you 20 minutes with the president and if not at least had its contents brought to your
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:40.440]  attention we have questions mr president lots of questions a lot of them are detailed in my letter
[2:27:41.000 --> 2:27:49.640]  but trust me there are hundreds more questions as my letter chronicles sir the 9 11 commission
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:57.160]  itself says they relied to deceived and essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation
[2:27:58.760 --> 2:28:03.880]  people of the united states and the world demand the truth sir we have to continue with the
[2:28:03.880 --> 2:28:11.640]  ass question that's what a patriot does that's what a true man does we ask questions you sir
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:18.440]  have the power as well as the responsibility to initiate a truly independent congressional

[2:28:37.800 --> 2:28:49.160]  of the history
[2:28:57.960 --> 2:29:03.960]  are you now saying that they weren't asking to block an investigation an investigation must not
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:10.680]  interfere with the ongoing efforts to prevent the next attack senator tom dashill said last week
[2:29:10.680 --> 2:29:15.960]  that you called him several times and urged him not to investigate the events of 9 11 times wrong
[2:29:15.960 --> 2:29:23.960]  he has uh i think in this case uh let's say a misinterpretation the chickens are coming home

[2:33:13.880 --> 2:33:20.280]  it is september 11 2009 eight years after the tragic events that hit new york and washington
[2:33:20.280 --> 2:33:26.280]  dc operation northwoods the official u.s. government plan to stage terror attacks in us cities to start
[2:33:26.280 --> 2:33:32.360]  a foreign war with cuba and the soviets operation ajax staging terror attacks in iran to blame it
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:36.840]  on their government declassified gulf of tonkin admittedly staged to get us into the vietnam
[2:33:36.840 --> 2:33:44.120]  war that killed over a million vietnamese and 58 000 americans false flag terror is real but charlie
[2:33:44.120 --> 2:33:51.480]  sheen of platoon and wall street and major league and of course the number one top paid tv star
[2:33:52.680 --> 2:33:57.960]  charlie sheen is simply asking questions and he's with us now into the bottom of the next hour
[2:33:57.960 --> 2:34:03.960]  for a full hour today bob mackle vane who lost his son in the towers will be joining us coming up
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:08.120]  later in the next hour of the last 15 minutes of this interview joining us from his home in

[2:34:14.040 --> 2:34:21.720]  great to be here as usual um i think right off the top uh uh we need to take a moment of silence
[2:34:21.720 --> 2:34:26.680]  for the victims of september 11 just know that those are uh those are the memories that we're
[2:34:26.680 --> 2:34:42.840]  honoring today a lot of people lost their lives a lot of people lost loved ones on that day and it
[2:34:42.840 --> 2:34:50.920]  is important to remember them and charlie uh political whores like villo riley and shon hanity and
[2:34:50.920 --> 2:34:57.000]  others their attack plan is to say that you're besmirching the memory of those that died when
[2:34:57.000 --> 2:35:01.400]  i've interviewed bill dole the head of the biggest families group saying the majority of them believe
[2:35:01.400 --> 2:35:06.120]  it's an inside job he does bob mackle vane they've protested around the white house and ground zero
[2:35:06.120 --> 2:35:13.080]  the media ignores them your letter and your request has been about having a meeting with the president
[2:35:13.080 --> 2:35:19.080]  and taking these victims family members there to the white house and but the media is involved in
[2:35:19.080 --> 2:35:23.720]  this hope saying the family's all by the official story when six of the ten commission members
[2:35:23.720 --> 2:35:30.440]  say it's a complete fraud yeah no well i guess it's um you know this is indicative of the times
[2:35:30.440 --> 2:35:35.880]  that uh that we live in if uh if people don't hear it on television then it must not be true
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:43.400]  you know which uh which is a sad state of affairs and um you know i think it uh i think we should
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:49.960]  talk about the fact that i that i reached out to the white house um uh that i uh i sent an email to
[2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:57.480]  uh press secretary gibbs and i got a call back from his uh from his deputy uh mr burton and uh he
[2:35:57.480 --> 2:36:03.880]  said um i respect to him i don't i don't believe in playing uh people's voice messages on you know
[2:36:03.880 --> 2:36:08.920]  airing them publicly but he said that um he would get back to me but he doesn't feel that uh that
[2:36:08.920 --> 2:36:15.480]  this thing is going to happen meaning my actual sit down with the president um and so i um i wrote
[2:36:15.480 --> 2:36:22.440]  them again and i said uh i you know i i i asked if i could um you know as an ambassador to the
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:30.440]  families um meet with the president with uh with bob macklevin in particular um representing
[2:36:31.160 --> 2:36:38.200]  their voice um i haven't heard back yet but i did in my email state that uh if the president
[2:36:38.200 --> 2:36:44.920]  denies this request i would at the very least uh expect a letter um with him detailing uh
[2:36:45.880 --> 2:36:48.840]  the uh his his decision to not do so
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:55.080]  charlie still waiting to hear out still waiting to hear back um
[2:36:56.840 --> 2:37:00.040]  i understand they got their hands full you know there's a lot of issues that they're tackling
[2:37:00.040 --> 2:37:04.600]  but i don't really think that they're any more important than um than what we're trying to address
[2:37:04.600 --> 2:37:10.840]  here yeah they're busy staging events it turned out the white house had ordered the new york police
[2:37:10.840 --> 2:37:16.680]  not to tell the mayor about the flyby air force one photo opt triggers panic in manhattan turned
[2:37:16.680 --> 2:37:22.040]  out the white house ran that to create some type of sigh op now you have this drill run by the coast
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:26.520]  guard with the media covering it like it's real just a mile from where he's giving a speech but
[2:37:26.520 --> 2:37:32.200]  he is now lovingly reassured us that everything's okay but reminded us of how how wicked the cave
[2:37:32.200 --> 2:37:36.840]  dwellers are and how we better give up all our rights or they'll get us yeah yeah i know because
[2:37:36.840 --> 2:37:41.720]  these guys in a uh in a cave in afghanistan with a satellite phone can get norad to stand down wow
[2:37:43.080 --> 2:37:49.000]  they're more powerful than we ever imagined um as far as that flyby um didn't it happen any of
[2:37:49.000 --> 2:37:53.400]  these clowns ever heard of photoshop i don't know i don't know call me crazy it just seemed uh
[2:37:54.120 --> 2:37:58.680]  a much easier and cheaper solution you know well it turned out it wasn't a photo op that there
[2:37:58.680 --> 2:38:03.000]  was a sigh op the white house ran got and and and that's hidden in plain view and that's clearly
[2:38:03.000 --> 2:38:07.240]  what's happening here but yeah uh they could have gotten a photo op for air force one over
[2:38:07.240 --> 2:38:13.560]  new york give me a break yeah uh let's let's talk about that media spin uh you wrote the
[2:38:13.560 --> 2:38:18.600]  letter so they would focus on the 20 points talk about that and then and then please expand
[2:38:18.600 --> 2:38:23.800]  on the fact that they continue to put words in your mouth and misrepresent what you're saying
[2:38:23.800 --> 2:38:31.400]  well yeah i mean but but um i i anticipated this um i didn't know that it would uh that
[2:38:31.400 --> 2:38:38.200]  it would be this egregious that it would be this blatant um you know i i i wrote the letter to get
[2:38:38.200 --> 2:38:44.040]  people's attention um oh my god did this really happen and then bang there's all the data um
[2:38:44.840 --> 2:38:49.720]  and so i think it's had the effect that um that i had hoped for and even more so um
[2:38:49.720 --> 2:38:56.760]  um but the media right now is really um really showing their their their ignorance as well as
[2:38:56.760 --> 2:39:06.520]  their their true colors um because uh i haven't read one hit piece one article um online or
[2:39:06.520 --> 2:39:14.840]  otherwise that that after attacking me personally they they they then never go on to say well we've
[2:39:14.840 --> 2:39:21.080]  looked at your 20 bullet points and here's why they're completely uh invalid and and based in fiction
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:28.760]  so i think that we put something out there that is so powerful that they can't figure out a way to
[2:39:28.760 --> 2:39:33.480]  disassemble it this time they're doing all their research and they're looking at all their archives
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:40.120]  and rather than um you know rolling out some experts or or or you know really looking at the
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:45.880]  facts and saying well this is questionable or that's questionable we've really tied their hands so um
[2:39:47.000 --> 2:39:56.040]  all they can do is attack me personally and it's um it's it's it's sad it's sad i mean actually kind
[2:39:56.040 --> 2:40:01.960]  of feel bad for these people that's all they got like oh he did this this and this okay all right
[2:40:01.960 --> 2:40:06.920]  keep going yeah i did that okay might have done that whatever let's get to the fact and they just
[2:40:06.920 --> 2:40:13.160]  they just don't get there you know but i think what we need to mention alex is that um is that uh
[2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:22.200]  we we we need to really thank um all the all the reader all the readers that have commented that
[2:40:22.200 --> 2:40:31.080]  have um really supported me in uh in the comment sections on a lot of these uh a lot of these articles
[2:40:31.080 --> 2:40:38.440]  because they themselves point out that that that that is clearly obvious mr or mrs whoever that you
[2:40:38.440 --> 2:40:43.720]  did not read his piece you did not address any of this all you're doing is attacking him personally
[2:40:43.720 --> 2:40:49.080]  and that's just it's just so predictable and then completely a name you know well charlie sheen
[2:40:49.720 --> 2:40:55.800]  take military dot com dozens of comments i only saw two uh that were against you and they were
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:41:01.000]  mindless and soft morrick the other comments even though the story was a hit piece said look
[2:41:02.120 --> 2:41:07.640]  his article does have a link to the washington post with six of the ten commission members
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:13.000]  saying it's a cover-up a lie there needs to be a criminal investigation of the pentagon in the
[2:41:13.000 --> 2:41:19.880]  white house and when i talked to you last night you wanted to specifically get into that we will
[2:41:19.880 --> 2:41:27.000]  later but but first off what about cheney and the false flag stuff that came out from cy harsh
[2:41:27.000 --> 2:41:33.080]  and even msnbc tell folks about that well i think people need to really really look at the connection
[2:41:33.080 --> 2:41:41.640]  look at the reality um between the facts that that this is the same man that concocted this
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:49.640]  this outrageous plan um as reported by by steamer herge uh which is detailed in the letter to
[2:41:50.920 --> 2:41:56.440]  for a a false flag states provocation to bring us into the iranian conflict and so
[2:41:57.000 --> 2:42:03.240]  people really need to look at that and really need to to look at the outline of of the of the
[2:42:03.240 --> 2:42:10.120]  measure of this insanity and then also take note that this is the same guy who violated
[2:42:10.120 --> 2:42:20.280]  it a a a or you served a 51 year standing protocol to to seize shoot down power from the generals
[2:42:20.280 --> 2:42:27.400]  at norad so the guy that came up with the with the insane uh spirit of our moose plan is the
[2:42:27.400 --> 2:42:35.400]  is the guy on 9 11 the only guy in the known universe with shoot down power and nobody's
[2:42:35.400 --> 2:42:40.280]  talking about that everybody's talking about everybody's talking about you know my past
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:46.280]  exploit so on and so forth so i don't have any i don't have any credibility they're just jealous
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:52.120]  as if the pentagon boys don't have any exploits hookers are more ubiquitous than water fountains
[2:42:52.120 --> 2:42:59.480]  in dc uh bill clinton but the point is expanding on this sir uh and not what you did when you were
[2:42:59.480 --> 2:43:07.080]  25 expanding on this it's dick cheney that wrote the peanut document september 20 of 2000 saying
[2:43:07.080 --> 2:43:12.280]  we need a big pearl harbor event a big terror attack a catalyzing event to launch our global
[2:43:12.280 --> 2:43:21.080]  domination yes which you'll which you know people will notice um that's uh observed uh through
[2:43:21.080 --> 2:43:26.360]  the voice of the president in my piece and and and not by myself which i think was key
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:31.960]  me tell folks why you had the idea this was all your idea and i think it was genius
[2:43:32.520 --> 2:43:37.400]  brilliant as many have said uh looking at the piece uh different literature sites hollywood
[2:43:37.400 --> 2:43:40.280]  sites even some that disagree with you are looking at and saying this is a really well
[2:43:40.280 --> 2:43:45.880]  written 16 page script how did you get the idea to have it 20 minutes with the president
[2:43:45.880 --> 2:43:53.240]  and then put it out the way we did well gosh um there were a couple of factors um there was a
[2:43:53.240 --> 2:44:00.120]  piece written by erin sorkin i believe it was in the washington post uh over a year ago and um
[2:44:00.120 --> 2:44:07.480]  and it was a fictional meeting between uh obama and my father's character uh president barlett
[2:44:07.480 --> 2:44:14.280]  from the west wing and um obama goes to him after dead's out of office and um and asked for advice
[2:44:14.280 --> 2:44:21.640]  and you know in the upcoming term uh etc and so uh i thought it was interesting i thought it was
[2:44:21.640 --> 2:44:28.600]  i thought it was fun you know i thought it was cute and really well written and then um uh a few
[2:44:28.600 --> 2:44:34.840]  months ago i um i just woke up with the uh with the title in my head 20 minutes with the president
[2:44:34.840 --> 2:44:42.040]  and i just started thinking what is this about what is this and i started um formulating this
[2:44:42.040 --> 2:44:47.560]  this this image of of president obama and myself sitting down and and having a discussion and i
[2:44:47.560 --> 2:44:51.480]  thought well what's the discussion about what am i really passionate about the discussions about 9
[2:44:51.480 --> 2:44:59.880]  11 and about a new investigation and then um and then i got into it and i i i lost focus i lost
[2:44:59.880 --> 2:45:08.040]  momentum i lost um i kind of lost my passion in the piece and uh and i watched a um i watched the
[2:45:08.040 --> 2:45:12.360]  documentary called press for truth it was about the jersey girls and the family steering committee
[2:45:12.360 --> 2:45:21.000]  and um and it was a gentleman i interviewed in there uh bob macklevin and um and i just i found
[2:45:21.000 --> 2:45:31.400]  something uh so powerful about his message so so completely disarming and and and and really
[2:45:31.400 --> 2:45:37.800]  pointed to to to all of all of these uh all these feelings that i had and all these thoughts i had
[2:45:37.800 --> 2:45:44.520]  about the piece and so um i i i discovered my motivation in that moment because i thought to
[2:45:44.520 --> 2:45:51.960]  myself if this gentleman if this man who is living a life of of this much sorrow can wake up one day
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:58.760]  and just just for that day feel a little bit better about the state of things because of the work
[2:45:58.760 --> 2:46:03.720]  that i've done because of the voice that i've utilized to bring attention to this if i can do
[2:46:03.720 --> 2:46:09.960]  that for him just one guy then i've done something good i've done something something that matters
[2:46:09.960 --> 2:46:17.240]  you know and of course that's beautiful charlie bob lost his son and he's now raising their grandson
[2:46:17.240 --> 2:46:21.880]  with he and his wife he's going to be on with us later in the next hour and uh to paraphrase what
[2:46:21.880 --> 2:46:25.080]  you told me when you called me and said you wanted me to come out and work with you on this piece i
[2:46:25.080 --> 2:46:30.280]  was very honored was that you'd had so many of the families had written to you over the years
[2:46:30.280 --> 2:46:34.760]  you'd seen their comments and stories thanking you but then saying why don't others stand up with him
[2:46:34.760 --> 2:46:38.280]  and and some did come out in the aftermath of you three years ago and going public
[2:46:39.000 --> 2:46:42.760]  that you are doing this for the families i mean you're somebody absolutely
[2:46:42.760 --> 2:46:47.800]  absolutely that high yeah go ahead that is my focus that is that is that is the driving force
[2:46:47.800 --> 2:46:57.080]  behind why i'm doing this um yeah but i think you know uh alec people need to know um how how
[2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:04.760]  integral you were to this process that i that i called on you as my research expert um as my uh
[2:47:04.760 --> 2:47:10.760]  as my as my point man on that front to really help me uh make this thing bulletproof if you look
[2:47:10.760 --> 2:47:17.160]  at what you brought to it and what we've done together um i think it it it really speaks to
[2:47:17.160 --> 2:47:23.480]  the fact that they can't as i said earlier you know disassemble this thing because it is um
[2:47:23.480 --> 2:47:30.920]  it's bulletproof and it's uh it's it's it's rooted in fact that that that we have collected
[2:47:31.480 --> 2:47:36.760]  from all of the mainstream arms of media and so that's what's pissing them off right now is that
[2:47:36.760 --> 2:47:41.640]  we're using all the stuff that they that they publish and now they can't refute it you know
[2:47:42.360 --> 2:47:48.920]  and it's ridiculous that limbaugh when it's all over the news and hundreds of papers first line
[2:47:48.920 --> 2:47:54.520]  in the times of london l.a times association everywhere that it was a mock letter of the
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:58.920]  points you'd like to bring to him kind of a vehicle to publicly give obama the data and
[2:47:58.920 --> 2:48:04.920]  there's no doubt the white house has read it and seen it you've talked to them now moving on here i
[2:48:04.920 --> 2:48:11.480]  want to later get back into the next phase with the winehouse a declaration of arms in the peaceful
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:17.640]  info war to stand up for 911 truth and demand a new congressional truly independent commission but
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:24.680]  specifically talking about media sure um there was one particular show the view and
[2:48:24.680 --> 2:48:32.840]  you've got a challenge for somebody yes i do elix um uh megan mccain john mccain's daughter i guess
[2:48:32.840 --> 2:48:39.400]  was on the view i don't watch the shows but i only uh i read the transcript and uh she hit some pretty
[2:48:39.400 --> 2:48:48.680]  uh gosh um uneducated uh uninformed comments about my piece uh or about me personally she wasn't
[2:48:48.680 --> 2:48:54.920]  even talking about the piece um i just got to believe alec that uh if that if i was sitting
[2:48:54.920 --> 2:48:59.640]  right next to her that her her tone would have been uh would have been a lot different um
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:09.400]  um but if she's such an expert on on on me first of all and and and and on on the event
[2:49:09.400 --> 2:49:16.280]  secondly um i would i would welcome her to an open debate uh just take the time in the place
[2:49:16.280 --> 2:49:21.560]  and i'll be there early she better pack lunch because it's it's going to take some time and
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:26.360]  specifically when we come back after this quick break we'll detail it because there's a whole
[2:49:26.360 --> 2:49:32.440]  backstory with cnn and larry king live going on and what's happening there and so officially in
[2:49:32.440 --> 2:49:40.920]  your own words uh you are challenging megan mccain to a debate on larry king live next week well
[2:49:40.920 --> 2:49:44.520]  larry king wouldn't schedule the piece because they couldn't find somebody to represent the other
[2:49:44.520 --> 2:49:48.920]  side so now that megan mccain has come out as an expert on me and on september 11 um
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:53.400]  we yeah no let's invite her out there let's see what she's got because i'm coming out there i'm
[2:49:53.400 --> 2:49:56.040]  coming out there with my letter i'm coming out there with the facts i'm coming out there with

[2:54:48.840 --> 2:54:55.960]  to issue the challenge go ahead let's do it i issued the challenge to debate mega mckay

[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:23.480]  we're not hiding we're not hiding charlie limbaugh even though every news article said it was a
[2:55:23.480 --> 2:55:28.040]  mock letter to give your information to obama to get his attention right every article out
[2:55:28.040 --> 2:55:33.160]  there says it was a mock letter limbaugh said it was real today and said obama really met with you
[2:55:33.160 --> 2:55:41.000]  and called him the head truther interesting um yeah that that that that seems a little
[2:55:41.000 --> 2:55:47.640]  irresponsible for a guy that uh that you know that's his it's his job to uh research the news
[2:55:47.640 --> 2:55:55.000]  that he's reporting one would think that that was the old description i guess um yeah but again
[2:55:55.000 --> 2:55:59.640]  again i think it's um you know with those hip pieces with the pinhead stuff and whatever else
[2:55:59.640 --> 2:56:07.640]  i didn't get i was told about it um uh it's just a it's the classic uh bullying syndrome you know
[2:56:07.640 --> 2:56:12.520]  it's it's you know they'll they'll oftentimes you'll you'll you'll discover that the bully is really
[2:56:12.520 --> 2:56:17.880]  the most scared kid on the playground and doesn't reveal that until he's confronted you know and
[2:56:17.880 --> 2:56:23.480]  these people are going to keep keep attacking me as long as i'm not there but um i gotta believe
[2:56:23.480 --> 2:56:28.360]  that they're you know as i said about megan that uh their tomb would be a lot different if i was
[2:56:28.360 --> 2:56:35.080]  sitting across from him with my letter and the facts you know you're throwing down the gauntlet
[2:56:35.080 --> 2:56:42.520]  yeah yeah i mean you know it's time enough enough you know we're having a discussion at your house
[2:56:43.240 --> 2:56:47.320]  and and and we're both on the same page i mean i wake up sometimes the middle of the night
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:52.120]  just thinking my god if they lied about 9 11 everything else is a lie they've been caught
[2:56:52.120 --> 2:56:58.120]  lying about wmds and yellow cake and everything else i mean how can we just let them sweep this
[2:56:58.120 --> 2:57:04.120]  under the rug of history in fact you have a line in your letter dealing with that yeah i do i do
[2:57:04.120 --> 2:57:09.480]  they just um they just you know they they they create the party line they say it over and over
[2:57:09.480 --> 2:57:16.680]  it's uh as i talk about in the uh in the piece the media mantras you know of uh disrespecting
[2:57:16.680 --> 2:57:22.520]  the memories of the victims and you know it's again like i said earlier if it's uh if it's on
[2:57:22.520 --> 2:57:28.680]  television it must be true you know we gotta get people to to to smash that paradigm we gotta get
[2:57:28.680 --> 2:57:34.520]  them to to start pulling back the curtain and start calling these people out start saying no no this
[2:57:34.520 --> 2:57:40.040]  is not how we feel this is not what we believe this is not this is not our stand stop misrepresenting
[2:57:40.040 --> 2:57:48.360]  us stop telling us great years now what the truth is about how we feel well the majority of the
[2:57:48.360 --> 2:57:52.600]  victims families and of the media listening wants me to give them their names and the
[2:57:52.600 --> 2:57:56.840]  and the majority of the families what in polls over 70 percent that were asked that they didn't
[2:57:56.840 --> 2:58:00.440]  like the commission and thought it was a lie and six of the 10 commission members and two of their
[2:58:00.440 --> 2:58:05.720]  council members so a total of eight say it's a complete fraud and a lie and that said that there
[2:58:05.720 --> 2:58:09.640]  should be criminal investigations of the White House and Pentagon i mean this is this is in the
[2:58:09.640 --> 2:58:14.520]  washington post and associated press and we're bad because we're going hey the commission says it's
[2:58:14.520 --> 2:58:20.040]  a lie yeah i think that's another part of this whole media spin machine is that they're they're
[2:58:20.040 --> 2:58:25.400]  now you know day two day three day four into this thing they're they're they're taking everything
[2:58:25.400 --> 2:58:31.080]  that that that i have illustrated uh in the bullet points and they're and they're putting

[2:59:59.160 --> 3:00:13.560]  it's one of the biggest stories out there right now we have retaken
[3:00:14.200 --> 3:00:20.600]  9-11 the establishments tried to put out a distorted view of history when their stories
[3:00:20.600 --> 3:00:27.000]  always changed our questions are unchanging and must be answered it is a fact that six of the
[3:00:27.000 --> 3:00:32.680]  10 commissioners say it's a fraud from the 9-11 commission itself appointed by bush we demand
[3:00:32.680 --> 3:00:37.080]  a new congressional investigation charlie got cut off by the break there finish up the point you
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:41.720]  were making about how the media will never focus on what you said they always distort what you're
[3:00:41.720 --> 3:00:47.560]  saying yeah and then they're they're they're putting you know words in my mouth that these are my
[3:00:47.560 --> 3:00:53.080]  opinions my theories these are my beliefs and when in fact it's just you know it's it's they're
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:01:00.040]  they're they're drawing from the bullet points and turning them into my words and there's now
[3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:04.920]  saying that you know that i said that the cia was working with them a lot and then blah blah blah
[3:01:04.920 --> 3:01:09.880]  so on and so forth and they're ignoring the fact that was the bell edmunds fbi translator just
[3:01:09.880 --> 3:01:15.960]  brought her her gag order you know and they're saying that uh that i'm insisting this was an
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:20.680]  inside job orchestrated by the bush cabal and so on and so forth when in fact i'm just pointing out
[3:01:20.680 --> 3:01:27.160]  that uh you know that that to look at these glaring inconsistency because alec let's base it
[3:01:27.160 --> 3:01:32.520]  how many how many points did you and i go through to come down to bring it down to 20
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:40.680]  probably 300 probably 300 yeah yeah should we reveal why it's 20 alex nobody's picked up on
[3:01:40.680 --> 3:01:49.320]  this happening it's 2020 it's 20 minutes it's 20 points 2020 vision what's nine plus 11 20 yeah
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:54.920]  oh charlie sheen the numerologist who can hear it now no but it's the establishment that's obsessed
[3:01:54.920 --> 3:02:03.320]  with that um i mean look we have a white house that day one said iraq did it and it turned out
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:07.640]  they knew iraq wasn't involved even if you believe the official story they premeditatedly that came
[3:02:07.640 --> 3:02:12.120]  out in the white house memo and the downing street memos that's the mainstream british news
[3:02:12.120 --> 3:02:16.520]  white house confirmed that they wanted to shoot down u.s aircraft or get them shot down to blame
[3:02:16.520 --> 3:02:20.760]  on sedam that they knew sedam wasn't involved they knew he didn't have yellow cake or nuclear bombs
[3:02:20.760 --> 3:02:25.640]  they knew he didn't have weapons systems and they persecuted the inspectors that told the truth
[3:02:25.640 --> 3:02:31.240]  and so if they'll lie about wmds and go kill over a million iraqis and 5000 us troops what else will
[3:02:31.240 --> 3:02:41.400]  they do uh i mean you tell me it seems like their record is um is a little tarnished going in
[3:02:41.400 --> 3:02:48.120]  a little bit tarnished well even msnb c inside her sh reported the cheney wanted to paint up
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:53.640]  u.s ships like iranian ships and have them attack our destroyers exactly exactly and as we discussed
[3:02:53.640 --> 3:02:58.120]  earlier this is the this is the same guy that was the only person alive that had shoot down
[3:02:58.120 --> 3:03:04.200]  authority and the authority to call for sorties on the hijacked airline so let's talk about that

[3:03:16.200 --> 3:03:19.240]  i guess we would i would i would love to hear their thoughts about that
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:24.920]  because if you know and unless they're gonna spend the entire time criticizing me and the
[3:03:24.920 --> 3:03:31.240]  things they think i've done or have done then you know let's talk about what's really going on
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:40.600]  charlie there's no doubt that you are risking a lot doing this there's no doubt we're risking our
[3:03:40.600 --> 3:03:45.960]  lives doing this these are murderers uh some of these people that run these dark systems again
[3:03:47.000 --> 3:03:51.800]  why did you do this um well let me just let me let me let me illustrate one thing there's um
[3:03:52.440 --> 3:03:57.480]  there's been a little heat from uh from the corporate side of uh of my workplace and um
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:03.720]  um what i've explained to them is hey this is where i work but i live in the real world and so
[3:04:04.920 --> 3:04:08.520]  you know i'm sorry i can't stand idly by any longer and just pretend like uh
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:14.040]  all this stuff is going to fix itself and if i if i've got a if i've got a platform that others
[3:04:14.040 --> 3:04:19.160]  don't that others need if i've got a voice that that that that that can be of service
[3:04:19.160 --> 3:04:24.840]  to those that need me then um i'm going to use it you know and i had an amazing example growing
[3:04:24.840 --> 3:04:30.200]  up of my father who uh who stood in the face of tyranny my my entire life and was ridiculed and
[3:04:30.200 --> 3:04:35.800]  criticized and called insane and misguided and uninformed and a radical and you know
[3:04:37.320 --> 3:04:42.520]  you know it can boil hat wearer and um and i had that as an example of a guy that just
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:49.560]  believed in the truth and believed in humanity believed in goodwill and believed in um you know
[3:04:49.560 --> 3:04:55.240]  and and and you know bringing uh bringing hope to the hopeless you know charlie we've got to

[3:08:19.560 --> 3:08:25.480]  communism imperialism any form of command and control tyranny and we just tell the truth we
[3:08:25.480 --> 3:08:30.600]  have a declassified government document a bc news operation northwoods u.s. government plan to bomb
[3:08:30.600 --> 3:08:35.560]  us cities as pretext for war we have army field manuals with the government stages terror it's
[3:08:35.560 --> 3:08:41.080]  declassified we talk about it uh we know that the guard is still shots are killing people and it's
[3:08:41.080 --> 3:08:45.640]  in it's in the news we cover it i mean that you know that's all we do here is tell the truth our
[3:08:45.640 --> 3:08:51.560]  only agenda is the truth charlie we're trying to explain your role models your father everything
[3:08:51.560 --> 3:08:58.760]  your father has done i mean he spoke out day one with you against the war and uh you guys really
[3:08:58.760 --> 3:09:02.600]  got attacked for that look who was proven right in the end how dare your dad say there weren't
[3:09:02.600 --> 3:09:08.680]  wmds we're on the right side of history yeah i think that's really key alex i think that's
[3:09:08.680 --> 3:09:14.280]  really key i i i absolutely believe that myself that we are on the right side of history and um
[3:09:14.280 --> 3:09:21.800]  um and i think it's only a matter of time before more join us on that right side and um i think
[3:09:21.800 --> 3:09:31.080]  what people need to understand and and what has been such a such a really offensive spin job is
[3:09:31.080 --> 3:09:36.120]  that i'm not claiming that i know what happened i'm not making those claims i'm just asking people
[3:09:36.120 --> 3:09:43.720]  to look at the inconsistencies look at the stuff look at the absolute facts that were completely
[3:09:43.720 --> 3:09:49.240]  ignored you know when you get into the doomsday plane with this anderson cooper reported on and
[3:09:49.240 --> 3:09:55.160]  then the commission deemed it and they had so much to to investigate they didn't feel it was
[3:09:55.160 --> 3:10:01.480]  important enough to include in the report guys it's the doomsday plane over new york over dc
[3:10:01.480 --> 3:10:07.960]  multiple government e4b's over command and control aircraft while this is happening but jets
[3:10:07.960 --> 3:10:13.240]  20 something miles away f16's can't get there but the doomsday planes are over both targets
[3:10:13.240 --> 3:10:17.960]  it's a real problem it needs to be looked at it needs to be looked at thoroughly
[3:10:20.440 --> 3:10:27.800]  let's let's let's let's subpoena and put those pilots under oath let's do that when did you take
[3:10:27.800 --> 3:10:31.560]  off how long were you in the air what was your mission what were you doing there what were you
[3:10:31.560 --> 3:10:39.000]  told and again alec it's not just me i mean these are the questions that the families had at the
[3:10:39.000 --> 3:10:43.880]  at the commission hearing these if this is the all the stuff that was that was completely
[3:10:43.880 --> 3:10:50.840]  swept aside and it was absolutely stonewalled at every turn and frustrated and and screaming out
[3:10:51.400 --> 3:10:58.200]  during the proceeding being escorted away as a security violation i mean come on come on just
[3:10:58.200 --> 3:11:04.520]  there yeah they're in there screaming saying cover up inside job their drug away people like bob
[3:11:04.520 --> 3:11:09.560]  mclevane whose son died and then meanwhile these media whores get up there and say all the families
[3:11:09.560 --> 3:11:15.720]  disagree with charlie sheen when here's an example out of salon 911 true signatory standby call for
[3:11:15.720 --> 3:11:21.640]  new investigation and salon called 50 of these people and only got two of them to halfway recant
[3:11:21.640 --> 3:11:26.840]  and salon rightfully said wrote a positive piece and said look people have a right to question what's
[3:11:26.840 --> 3:11:35.080]  going on they have a horse they do i mean that's the country i was raised in that's what i was told
[3:11:35.080 --> 3:11:41.560]  to believe in charlie let's go over some of these other points but before we do that i want to go
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:47.160]  back to sabelle edmonds she's the fbi translator listening to nsa intercepts she goes public on
[3:11:47.160 --> 3:11:51.720]  this show and other shows about four years ago federal gag order she's trying to get around it
[3:11:51.720 --> 3:11:58.200]  she's saying drug running terrorist funding human trafficking murder hit teams that's now
[3:11:58.200 --> 3:12:03.800]  all come out the chain he was running hit teams uh in mainstream news illegally even in the us
[3:12:03.800 --> 3:12:09.320]  against non al-qaeda lcaa to targets sure and she comes out now breaks the federal gag order
[3:12:09.320 --> 3:12:13.960]  about a month ago it was the middle of uh august yeah and and and and goes public and we've got
[3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:18.680]  clips in the video your message to the president saying up until the day of 9 11 bin laden and
[3:12:18.680 --> 3:12:25.480]  al-qaeda and taliban we're working for the cia yeah and it didn't get any mainstream coverage
[3:12:25.480 --> 3:12:31.080]  whatsoever why is that not the top story on the six o'clock evening news
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:37.320]  why is the fbi revealing that ted olson listener general never got the phone call
[3:12:38.040 --> 3:12:43.000]  from his wife depending on what why is that not the lead story on the six o'clock evening news
[3:12:43.880 --> 3:12:48.360]  what about the cell phones they they still can't make them work above 10 000 feet every time i'm
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:54.520]  on a flight i try as i take off with it you know to see when it cuts out does it about 3000 feet
[3:12:54.520 --> 3:12:59.400]  every time i know how tall these radio towers are there 2000 i got about 1000 above it cuts out
[3:13:00.120 --> 3:13:05.640]  if i'm lucky uh flying into la in places i'll have it on at 20 000 10 000 the sucker doesn't
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:10.920]  turn on till a thousand feet or so then they admit she didn't use their phones then the fbi says
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:16.600]  yeah we have no record of her ever making her call getting through to him to ted olson uh what's
[3:13:16.600 --> 3:13:21.320]  give us your take on that these magical cell phones that on a bunch of flights were working that day
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:28.360]  well again alex i think that uh these are areas that that that you know we can only ask that that
[3:13:28.360 --> 3:13:35.720]  that some scientific research be be presented behind and that um you know for us to to sit here
[3:13:35.720 --> 3:13:42.360]  and and try to figure all that out i mean it um at at base value it sounds absurd but let's
[3:13:42.360 --> 3:13:48.120]  investigate it let's look at it further let's turn it over to some experts let's see what they
[3:13:48.120 --> 3:13:53.000]  have to say forget my opinion of it forget your opinion of what i mean yeah it's pretty obvious
[3:13:53.000 --> 3:13:56.520]  but still let's let's put it in the hands of the people that do that stuff for a living
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:14:02.920]  guys a thousand times smarter than me stuff they do all day every day let's give it to them along
[3:14:02.920 --> 3:14:10.760]  with all these other points all these other all these other facts and and and you know omissions
[3:14:10.760 --> 3:14:19.800]  as they were and as they are charlie i have bought bob mackle vane i have bob mackle vane
[3:14:19.800 --> 3:14:23.080]  on the line with us and we're gonna have him on for about five minutes or something we're
[3:14:23.080 --> 3:14:25.960]  gonna go back through some of the final points in the time we have left with you today but
[3:14:26.520 --> 3:14:32.440]  there's a famous quote by bob mackle vane about his son he says it upsets me tremendously that
[3:14:32.440 --> 3:14:39.640]  bobby my son who died could be used as a political pawn to be manipulated at times like this
[3:14:39.640 --> 3:14:45.000]  and abused and he went on from there but instead of his reading quotes from bob who lost his son
[3:14:46.840 --> 3:14:54.360]  bobby on 9 11 i want to go ahead and go to him now bob mackle vane who was in the 9 11 commission
[3:14:54.360 --> 3:14:59.240]  who tried to speak to him sir what do you think on this eighth anniversary about what charlie and all
[3:14:59.240 --> 3:15:06.200]  of us are doing well it anyone does anything like i just so greatly appreciate it because
[3:15:06.200 --> 3:15:12.360]  you know i it's very difficult to you know i can no one can sit there and coordinate what's
[3:15:12.360 --> 3:15:18.920]  happening and charlie just said you hear these things but you know they have to be investigated
[3:15:18.920 --> 3:15:23.720]  well that's faster than my life's doing because you know after going to the 9 11 commission hearing
[3:15:23.720 --> 3:15:29.400]  i came out so disgusted absolutely disgusted that you know and veneese had even said that
[3:15:29.400 --> 3:15:35.320]  this is not an investigation it's merely an exposition and again i always tell people
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:42.600]  he's looking at it as a parent and as a parent my son was murdered and here the 9 11 commission
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:47.640]  who were supposed to be investigating the murder of my son and i try to keep it to myself i'm not a
[3:15:47.640 --> 3:15:54.440]  spokesperson for anyone else in the 9 11 movement because that's my job as a parent as a father to
[3:15:54.440 --> 3:15:59.400]  find out how my son was murdered and i actually thought maybe during the line 11 3 maybe they're
[3:15:59.400 --> 3:16:04.760]  going to really find out if this is true like he added that and saying well nothing they told me is true
[3:16:05.720 --> 3:16:10.040]  so i'll tell people you know they saw you're getting involved these conspiracy theories this
[3:16:10.040 --> 3:16:15.400]  thing this doesn't happen if there was conspiracy theories that's all i'm doing please tell me what
[3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:22.120]  happened i mean god when you hear the fb i says that we can't prove it obon some of the line was
[3:16:22.120 --> 3:16:28.280]  part of it uh you know when i picked up the flight manifest i don't see any Arabs on it well i don't
[3:16:28.280 --> 3:16:32.520]  know for sure who's on the plane i certainly think cheese what happened here you know what i mean
[3:16:32.520 --> 3:16:36.760]  well bob macklevin a former school teacher in philadelphia his son bobby was killed in the attacks
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:43.800]  on the world trade center in new york on september 11th uh is joining us bob uh what about magic
[3:16:43.800 --> 3:16:50.920]  passports at the pentagon at shanksville with flight 93 and at the world trade center less than a day
[3:16:50.920 --> 3:16:58.360]  after with feet of rubble and dust and papers everywhere the fb i find an unscathed passport of
[3:16:58.360 --> 3:17:06.600]  one of the lead hijackers i mean come on how obvious does this have to get well again with that i
[3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:13.000]  you know i would still say to someone that all right they found the passport there it's my
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:19.080]  modeling to me i mean immediately i heard that i said this doesn't sound right but i wouldn't base
[3:17:19.080 --> 3:17:25.240]  anything on that you know the more i investigate no question we don't have the time i could i think
[3:17:25.240 --> 3:17:31.000]  i could sit here for six months and we spoke about nine eleven which you know i will do another show
[3:17:31.000 --> 3:17:35.400]  with you and maybe charlie can come back in a few weeks when you're on a landline i know you
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:39.320]  were down there at the memorial today you're traveling back in a car right now on cell phone
[3:17:39.320 --> 3:17:45.080]  but but but charlie which i know you and bob have talked privately i got you guys together
[3:17:45.080 --> 3:17:51.160]  would you like to say anything about my macklevin bob i just want to say that i'm that i am i'm just
[3:17:51.160 --> 3:17:58.680]  so deeply sorry for your loss i'm a i'm a father of five and i and i i can't even imagine what
[3:17:58.680 --> 3:18:05.000]  you've been through for almost a decade now and um and i hope that my efforts and the efforts of
[3:18:05.000 --> 3:18:12.520]  people like alex and all of those that are that are that are joining our cause are already a part
[3:18:12.520 --> 3:18:18.840]  of it um i hope that uh that we can not only deliver some hope but we can also deliver some answers
[3:18:21.320 --> 3:18:28.760]  bob thanks charlie appreciate that it's the least i can do bob it's my duty bob does it
[3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:33.480]  anger you i mean i'll talk to you on the phone it does to watch shon hannity rush limbaugh
[3:18:34.200 --> 3:18:38.520]  bill o'reilly saying none of the families think it's an inside job that they're angry at charlie
[3:18:38.520 --> 3:18:42.680]  but they never but they never bring these people on the show they're just they're lying saying this
[3:18:44.520 --> 3:18:49.880]  but is that to me yeah alex yes does that make you mad yeah you know i try i i try not to get
[3:18:49.880 --> 3:18:55.640]  it i mean i really have to work on my anger and i really watch this show and i you know i just i
[3:18:55.640 --> 3:19:01.080]  look at them as enter container and to me it's a bit relish i mean like you look at it going back
[3:19:01.080 --> 3:19:06.360]  i mean they're there to make money as far as i'm concerned and uh and they do that to get people
[3:19:06.360 --> 3:19:11.000]  angry and that's why you know sometimes you really have to protect yourself and try to stay away
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:15.480]  specifically they are misrepresenting the families i've interviewed all the heads of the biggest
[3:19:15.480 --> 3:19:20.920]  groups and they all say they have there's no question about that but you know that they have
[3:19:20.920 --> 3:19:25.640]  that kind of power because if people hear from them then they'll believe it but i mean just to
[3:19:25.640 --> 3:19:30.040]  be clear on record just to be clear on record you and many other family members and victims
[3:19:31.560 --> 3:19:35.400]  are not angry at charlie and you're i mean are you tired of them misrepresenting you
[3:19:35.400 --> 3:19:41.160]  and wrapping themselves in the victims oh of course i am you know i do get angry but that's
[3:19:41.160 --> 3:19:46.200]  why i won't watch the show because it gets me angry and i you know you have to think
[3:19:46.200 --> 3:19:51.160]  well we have to think i'm coming because i just can't get the word out if you don't
[3:19:51.160 --> 3:19:55.720]  and uh and you know i'll tell people that i'll sign those thousand people it's not you know
[3:19:55.720 --> 3:20:01.480]  personally but just for the website and sometimes it gets me angry that more not 11 family members
[3:20:01.480 --> 3:20:05.800]  aren't doing more yeah i've told people i say you know if we got 200 family members went down
[3:20:05.800 --> 3:20:10.280]  there and did civil disobedience down at the pentagon or down at the fbi building i'll tell
[3:20:10.280 --> 3:20:15.560]  you what we we get something done but you know it's just it's such an emotional thing to get
[3:20:15.560 --> 3:20:20.120]  involved in and that's that's where the problem is so don't hear from family members that they
[3:20:20.120 --> 3:20:24.840]  feel that this is horrible what we're doing but they just don't hear from the other family members
[3:20:24.840 --> 3:20:33.640]  because it's so difficult to do this sure bob in closing bob in closing specifically what do you
[3:20:33.640 --> 3:20:39.000]  from your research believe happened on 9 11 i think you had 19 patties that came in they were
[3:20:39.000 --> 3:20:45.240]  trained in the united states uh kelly shake behind it was a patty and more rad it was a combination
[3:20:45.240 --> 3:20:49.720]  of stand down and because of the war games it was really easy you know people said well there had to
[3:20:49.720 --> 3:20:55.720]  be thousands of people but if you understand the war games the plane should have been intercepted
[3:20:55.720 --> 3:21:01.560]  and what happened in the months before and what happened on that day is just unbelievable and
[3:21:01.560 --> 3:21:06.200]  that's where the story is seems a lot of 9 11 troopers i don't know if they were but we don't
[3:21:06.200 --> 3:21:11.080]  talk about it those planes should have been intercepted that's data procedure and real
[3:21:11.080 --> 3:21:16.440]  quickly general wire said well that we never we we were trained to look at to the outside
[3:21:16.440 --> 3:21:25.640]  but one of the missions of new iraq and it's been since 1958 when new iraq was started that air
[3:21:25.640 --> 3:21:31.240]  sovereignty is the most thing that they have to look after so that's where an investigation goes
[3:21:31.240 --> 3:21:38.280]  and that's what convinced me 100% like i would not go around saying i think i know all right bob
[3:21:38.280 --> 3:21:43.640]  bob in closing here we're gonna have some final comments from charlie sheen charlie

[3:22:55.240 --> 3:22:59.320]  view this later and listen to it later the call to arms the call to action what do you
[3:22:59.320 --> 3:23:05.000]  want to see a 9 11 truth my friend i want people to start standing up i want people first of all
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:13.720]  to wake up those that haven't already and then and then sorry to interrupt it and then and then
[3:23:13.720 --> 3:23:20.680]  just know that they have a voice and that and that through in in en masse in numbers they have a
[3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:28.280]  bigger voice and and and reach out to your local politicians get organized get petitions going make
[3:23:28.280 --> 3:23:33.480]  the voice louder bring this thing to a point where they cannot ignore it where it isn't just
[3:23:33.480 --> 3:23:39.080]  you know a whack job actor from hollywood talking about fantasy theories get involved people get
[3:23:39.080 --> 3:23:43.320]  out there do something it's one thing to say i really appreciate all the comments and all the
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:51.240]  support but take that energy and put it into action put it into action and demand the truth get on
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:24:01.080]  the right side of history with us beautifully said 9 11 was meant by the scientific dictatorship
[3:24:01.080 --> 3:24:05.320]  the controllers in their own documents they talk about how they would stage massive terror attacks
[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:12.040]  to get total power it was meant to be the event to set up a planetary police state i believe 9 11
[3:24:12.040 --> 3:24:20.040]  is going to end up and also these premeditated offensive crimes against humanity these these
[3:24:20.040 --> 3:24:26.840]  offensive preemptive wars i believe it's going to be their waterloo charlie i hope you're right
[3:24:26.840 --> 3:24:36.280]  alex i hope you're right i mean uh you know they they've this stuff happens in in broad daylight
[3:24:36.280 --> 3:24:44.040]  and um you know that's the arrogance that's the uh that's the the pathology that we're
[3:24:44.040 --> 3:24:51.240]  dealing with here and um we just need to keep asking the hard questions keep insisting that
[3:24:51.240 --> 3:24:59.000]  that that people don't allow ourselves to be dismissed just pushed over there and i think
[3:24:59.000 --> 3:25:03.080]  it's you know it's like what erin russo said so wonderfully in his final interview and that
[3:25:03.080 --> 3:25:08.360]  wonderful documentary that that that you put together with him he says don't be afraid to
[3:25:08.360 --> 3:25:12.760]  be called stupid don't be afraid to be called crazy don't be afraid to have a voice don't be
[3:25:12.760 --> 3:25:16.440]  afraid to stand up and say wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute people this doesn't make any
[3:25:16.440 --> 3:25:22.760]  sense and i'm insisting that somebody somebody look at this somebody that has the power to
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:31.240]  make a change needs to look at this enough well charlie sheen your courage is an example to all
[3:25:31.240 --> 3:25:37.960]  of us a man who is the highest paid tv actor out there five children a great life and takes a lot
[3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:42.840]  of risk and i know this has been good for your soul as you said many times to me food for the soul
[3:25:42.840 --> 3:25:51.560]  but at the same time very stressful uh and if we all lead by your example we're going to be in a
[3:25:51.560 --> 3:25:55.640]  better world because great tyranny is upon us and people better get involved we're being lied to
[3:25:55.640 --> 3:26:01.320]  about the banking takeover the 23.7 trillion i know you'd also said that the obama deception
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:06.200]  you'd supported obama really also helped crystallize that why isn't he calling for a new investigation
[3:26:06.200 --> 3:26:10.600]  what was your take on the obama deception that was a masterpiece alex really i think it should
[3:26:10.600 --> 3:26:16.040]  be mandatory viewing for anybody in this country especially those who voted for him like myself
[3:26:16.680 --> 3:26:22.520]  and uh you know anybody else on the planet that that wants the truth about what's really going on
[3:26:23.080 --> 3:26:28.920]  and i would i would urge people to to get it make copies hand it out promote it
[3:26:28.920 --> 3:26:36.120]  insist you know organize groups to watch it have pulled screening uh i think it is it is along with
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:41.320]  endgame but it is one of the most important documentaries ever produced and i and i and i
[3:26:41.320 --> 3:26:49.160]  tip my head to you for for having the courage to to deliver such an important uh historical piece
[3:26:49.880 --> 3:26:54.760]  i'm just freaking uh just proud to know you man hey i'm proud to call you my friend
[3:26:55.400 --> 3:26:58.920]  hey i'm proud to call you my friend you know we didn't go over all the 20 points
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:03.640]  that you know what you know what they they they they speak for themselves you know
[3:27:03.640 --> 3:27:07.880]  and the mainstream media ain't going over the 20 points either and what does that say
[3:27:07.880 --> 3:27:14.600]  what does that say alex they won't even talk about them if i'm so crazy if i've aligned myself with
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:19.960]  so many nutbags and you know how dare i am so unpatriotic and i'm such a you know a complete
[3:27:20.760 --> 3:27:26.680]  it's a nut job why won't they address what i wrote why won't they address what we assembled
[3:27:26.680 --> 3:27:34.280]  why won't they even look at it or even talk about it that speaks volumes that shows their hand i agree
[3:27:34.280 --> 3:27:40.760]  but i don't want to end this interview in the few minutes we've got left without you getting into
[3:27:40.760 --> 3:27:45.960]  building seven and and you say in the piece just watch the video the collapse yeah we have a link
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:49.480]  to the police environment saying we've been told to get back they're going to blow it up
[3:27:49.480 --> 3:27:54.920]  bbc reports it's fallen completely in its own footprint before it falls then they said oh that
[3:27:54.920 --> 3:27:59.480]  video is not real then they admitted it was real and they said oh we lost the tapes then they said
[3:27:59.480 --> 3:28:07.080]  okay roiders told us it had fallen yeah they didn't really have their story straight or they got the
[3:28:07.080 --> 3:28:11.640]  story and then they just rolled it out early i don't know but the reason that that is the one
[3:28:11.640 --> 3:28:16.200]  point and it's obviously number seven because building seven that's pretty obvious um the
[3:28:16.200 --> 3:28:23.240]  reason that um that i only gave it one line is uh if i'm not mistaken wasn't it um wasn't it uh
[3:28:23.240 --> 3:28:30.840]  reduced to a footnote in the uh official report yeah so that you know they they gave it uh that
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:36.280]  much attention and the attention that we give it in the piece i think is really powerful because
[3:28:36.280 --> 3:28:41.000]  it's just like basically saying mr president just take a look for yourself you're a really smart
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:46.920]  guy you were really educated man just take a look for yourself you know let's watch it together
[3:28:46.920 --> 3:28:52.760]  and then you tell me is that the result of the you know from fire charlie i know you've got to go
[3:28:52.760 --> 3:28:56.280]  to work and tape two and a half men that's going to be airing monday so i'm going to just let you
[3:28:56.280 --> 3:29:01.640]  go in just two or three minutes but premiere on the 21st couldn't help but put in a plug
[3:29:01.640 --> 3:29:06.280]  hey that's a great show guys are fans in here thank you thank you especially jaren he loves it
[3:29:06.280 --> 3:29:12.280]  also hey alex uh big shout out to your whole staff guys like erin kurt paul and the guys that just
[3:29:12.280 --> 3:29:18.040]  worked 22 hour days leading up to this thing and they just uh they just really really showed
[3:29:18.040 --> 3:29:21.400]  who they are and what they're made of and how much they care as well and these are the guys
[3:29:21.400 --> 3:29:25.560]  behind the scenes that don't get the type of attention you and i get but but everybody
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:32.360]  needs to know how important they were in this uh in this whole process and launching uh 20 minutes
[3:29:32.360 --> 3:29:38.440]  with the president you know yeah i always won't almost give it its codename said 20 minutes with
[3:29:38.440 --> 3:29:49.800]  the president um yeah it's tempting it's tempting alex well keep that between us yeah yeah charlie
[3:29:49.800 --> 3:29:56.360]  in closing though are you disappointed that so far the white house called you and said look we've
[3:29:56.360 --> 3:30:01.400]  seen it where we might pass on it which shows they're leaving the door open i know you're calling
[3:30:01.400 --> 3:30:06.120]  people to go out get involved go to town halls go to his press conferences you're asking i know you've
[3:30:06.120 --> 3:30:09.640]  asked me to ask folks to tell people to go to the press conferences of the president go to
[3:30:09.640 --> 3:30:15.160]  demonstrations let's make this a big issue let's beat the drum speak to that in closing and directly
[3:30:15.160 --> 3:30:21.160]  to obama because there's no doubt that the white house is watching and seeing this well let's hope
[3:30:21.160 --> 3:30:24.760]  let's hope i mean i know like i said they got their hands full with a lot of other stuff but they
[3:30:24.760 --> 3:30:30.760]  need to know that this this really matters this is this is uh you know it's all laid out in the
[3:30:30.760 --> 3:30:38.120]  letter that you know how much this is uh this is shaped that the current uh policy and that the
[3:30:38.120 --> 3:30:48.200]  you know why the landscape uh exist as it does today and um you know i uh if they cannot meet
[3:30:48.200 --> 3:30:54.600]  with myself and certain family members um they really need to write me a letter and explain
[3:30:54.600 --> 3:31:00.440]  why i wrote them a letter and um they need to explain why and they need to know that that
[3:31:00.440 --> 3:31:06.120]  letter will be will be made public because it's important that that that that people know uh
[3:31:06.120 --> 3:31:12.920]  how they feel about this that people know you know if if they got nothing to hide then
[3:31:12.920 --> 3:31:17.640]  why are they avoiding it and let's be clear it's not just charlie sheen me when the president
[3:31:17.640 --> 3:31:23.240]  you've said in the emails i like to come above mackle vane bill dole others and and they want
[3:31:23.240 --> 3:31:28.440]  to meet with you they try to meet with the commission absolutely yes yeah no they uh
[3:31:28.440 --> 3:31:34.920]  uh they deserve the time they deserve the attention they deserve that uh that that that you know
[3:31:34.920 --> 3:31:41.160]  that our commander-in-chief would uh would would take a look at this and would hopefully say yeah
[3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:47.000]  okay all right this is uh this is important this matters and yes i do have the power and i do have
[3:31:47.000 --> 3:31:52.600]  the responsibility as your president to use my executive power to enact a real investigation
[3:31:52.600 --> 3:31:56.920]  and put this thing back on the front burner put it on the front burner mr president
[3:31:56.920 --> 3:32:03.640]  front burner mr president enough to know so bottom line you're saying at least publicly respond
[3:32:03.640 --> 3:32:08.280]  to the 20 questions or just respond to six of the 10 commission members and two of the five
[3:32:08.280 --> 3:32:13.000]  council members saying it was a fraud any criminal cover-up anything else just acknowledge it
[3:32:13.000 --> 3:32:19.400]  just be courageous enough and compassionate enough to acknowledge it that's all i'm asking
[3:32:20.040 --> 3:32:24.760]  and if we can take it further great but just acknowledge it stop treating us like
[3:32:24.760 --> 3:32:30.920]  like we don't matter all right charlie sheen he's going to go tape for the
[3:32:32.280 --> 3:32:37.560]  21st uh this month premiere two and a half men we're letting get to work uh how are the fires

[3:32:42.760 --> 3:32:48.920]  an amazing job getting this stuff uh put out as quickly as possible and uh fortunately there were
[3:32:48.920 --> 3:32:55.480]  there were some lives lost and uh our hearts are hard to go out to their families as well but uh
[3:32:55.480 --> 3:33:01.960]  but the skies are skies are clear and uh things back to normal yeah it was like a week and a
[3:33:01.960 --> 3:33:06.520]  half ago when i was there it was like flying into hell and you had ashes raining down in your backyard
[3:33:07.400 --> 3:33:14.360]  yeah it was uh it was interesting it it it created sort of a uh symbolic climate for

[3:33:47.640 --> 3:33:52.920]  in six minutes and take your phone calls and recap this historic amazing interview this redecleration
[3:33:52.920 --> 3:33:58.280]  of 9 11 truth declaring war on the lie the fraud that is the fable that is the official story of 9
[3:33:58.280 --> 3:34:03.080]  11 here it is no warning signs that i'm aware of the city and it was a revelation that the white
[3:34:03.080 --> 3:34:08.120]  house had no intention of making public president bush was told in august that it was summer bin
[3:34:08.120 --> 3:34:13.640]  laudan might be planning an attack involving the hijack could have predicted nobody arguably uh
[3:34:13.640 --> 3:34:19.320]  august six uh pdp i believe the title was bin laudan determined to attack inside the united states
[3:34:20.760 --> 3:34:25.080]  70 percent of family members questions were never answered during the 9 11 commissioner
[3:34:25.080 --> 3:34:29.320]  report the hamilton and thomas king said they were set up to fail i mean i remember the commission
[3:34:29.320 --> 3:34:38.600]  it's a scam it's absolutely disgusting the questions mr president the questions building
[3:34:38.600 --> 3:34:43.720]  seven ablaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse building seven
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:50.520]  three phone collapse well no there's number seven coming down the excitement and the fun
[3:34:50.520 --> 3:34:54.600]  the people get watching an old building being demolished and they wired very carefully for days
[3:34:54.600 --> 3:34:59.960]  and it's a very careful operation third time today it was to reminiscent of those pictures revolting
[3:35:00.520 --> 3:35:05.000]  too much on television before a building was deliberately destroyed destroyed by world
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:10.760]  place dynamite to knock it down this one of these doors is pulling uh and they made that decision
[3:35:10.760 --> 3:35:16.840]  to pull and then we watched the building collapse jane what more can you tell us about the salomon
[3:35:16.840 --> 3:35:21.640]  brother's building and its collapse well only really what you already know details are very very
[3:35:21.640 --> 3:35:26.760]  sketchy you're getting information now that one of the other buildings building seven in the world
[3:35:26.760 --> 3:35:36.600]  trade center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing the pentagon vanishing
[3:35:36.600 --> 3:35:43.400]  airplane my close-up inspection there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the pentagon
[3:35:43.400 --> 3:35:49.000]  the only site is the actual side of the building that's crashed in and as i said the only pieces
[3:35:49.000 --> 3:35:54.920]  left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand there are no large
[3:35:54.920 --> 3:36:00.760]  tail sections wing sections a fuselage nothing like that anywhere around which would indicate
[3:36:00.760 --> 3:36:06.360]  that the entire plane crashed into the side of the pentagon firefighters and police
[3:36:07.320 --> 3:36:13.400]  describing explosions a lot of them the secondary explosion we've got numerous people covered with
[3:36:13.400 --> 3:36:18.760]  dust on the secondary explosion just floor by floor it said i'm popping out it was like it was different if it had
[3:36:18.760 --> 3:36:22.840]  dead leaves dead leaves they were planned to take down a building boom boom boom boom boom
[3:36:22.840 --> 3:36:27.320]  looks sort of like the building just demolished even if there was no secondary explosives in the
[3:36:27.320 --> 3:36:32.040]  building sound like gunfire you know bang bang bang bang and then and then all of a sudden three
[3:36:32.040 --> 3:36:37.640]  big explosions do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse to me it sounded
[3:36:37.640 --> 3:36:45.080]  like it to me it sounded like an explosion chief albert terry told me that he tried to get his men
[3:36:45.080 --> 3:36:49.640]  out as quickly as he could but he said that there was another explosion which took place
[3:36:49.640 --> 3:36:54.840]  and then an hour after there was another explosion in one of the towers here
[3:36:58.440 --> 3:37:05.880]  sebel edmonds fbi translator breaking her gag order all our intimate relationship with bin laden
[3:37:05.880 --> 3:37:12.600]  and and to alaban we did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way
[3:37:12.600 --> 3:37:18.680]  up to september 11 bin laden was spirited into this military hospital in rowa pendee for kidney
[3:37:18.680 --> 3:37:23.560]  dialysis treatment the military had him surrounded they were saying that Osama bin laden had to be
[3:37:23.560 --> 3:37:35.160]  watched carefully and looked at norad standing down where were the planes on now to one of the
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:39.480]  eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9 11 a mysterious plane was seen flying right over the
[3:37:39.480 --> 3:37:45.720]  president's residence e4b is over new york and washington otherwise known as the doomsday planes
[3:37:45.720 --> 3:37:54.040]  has never been officially explained cell phones working at impossible altitudes solicitor general
[3:37:54.040 --> 3:38:00.200]  ted olson receiving phone calls that the fbi says were never made what happened during that call
[3:38:00.200 --> 3:38:07.800]  this is the only information we have on these terrorists she was able to call him twice how
[3:38:07.800 --> 3:38:14.280]  she could pull that off we don't know but she did these are the questions mr president these are
[3:38:14.280 --> 3:38:25.480]  the questions they go on and on good afternoon mr president i come to you today representing the
[3:38:25.480 --> 3:38:32.760]  families of the victims of september 11th as well as millions of my fellow americans hopefully by
[3:38:32.760 --> 3:38:39.720]  now you've had a chance to read my letter to you 20 minutes with the president and if not at least
[3:38:39.720 --> 3:38:46.600]  that its contents brought to your attention we have questions mr president lots of questions
[3:38:47.560 --> 3:38:53.720]  a lot of them are detailed in my letter but trust me there are hundreds more questions
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:02.680]  as my letter chronicles sir the 9 11 commission itself says they relied to deceived and
[3:39:03.480 --> 3:39:09.480]  essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation people of the united states and
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:16.200]  the world demand the truth sir we have to continue with the ass question that's what a patriot does
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:24.440]  that's what a troll does we ask questions you sir have the power as well as the responsibility
[3:39:25.000 --> 3:39:31.160]  to initiate a truly independent congressional investigation into the events of 9 11 as well
[3:39:31.160 --> 3:39:36.600]  as its aftermath we want our country back mr president therefore i'm not just calling on you
[3:39:36.600 --> 3:39:43.000]  and your team i'm calling on each and every american citizen to wake up stand up and demand the truth
[3:39:44.440 --> 3:39:47.720]  we're counting on you mr president be on the right side of history
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:57.800]  and what did thomas jefferson say what did he say the truth's form of patriotism is
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:05.080]  this descent is the highest form of patriotism thomas jefferson
[3:40:07.480 --> 3:40:13.480]  are you now saying that they weren't asking to block an investigation an investigation must not
[3:40:13.480 --> 3:40:20.200]  interfere with the ongoing efforts to prevent the next attack senator tom dashill said last week
[3:40:20.200 --> 3:40:25.480]  that you called him several times and urged him not to investigate the events of 9 11 times wrong
[3:40:25.480 --> 3:40:33.880]  he has a i think in this case uh let's say a misinterpretation all right ladies and gentlemen
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:38.040]  that's charlie sheen's video message to the president he's heard him live for an hour on air
[3:40:41.240 --> 3:40:46.360]  and all of this is possible because of the listeners the sponsors the genesis network
[3:40:46.360 --> 3:40:52.920]  my crew here want to thank all of our sponsors we skipped three of the breaks today those will
[3:40:52.920 --> 3:41:01.080]  be replaced it's just amazing and we really are asking for it doing this but you got to
[3:41:01.080 --> 3:41:05.720]  stand up to murderers you got to stand up to tyranny our ancestors did this at many key junctures
[3:41:05.720 --> 3:41:08.440]  and many of them pay with their lives or their treasure or their names
[3:41:11.000 --> 3:41:16.360]  all real men and women have to stand up against evil and corruption and i told you back on monday
[3:41:16.360 --> 3:41:23.880]  before all this was launched that tuesday was only the beginning it's about making it a debate
[3:41:23.880 --> 3:41:27.560]  with the president it's about making it an issue of putting it on the plate of the president it's
[3:41:27.560 --> 3:41:34.120]  about forcing those 20 points out there to be looked at and no doubt hundreds of major newspapers
[3:41:34.120 --> 3:41:39.240]  and hundreds of blogs and thousands of websites have posted 20 minutes with the president tens of
[3:41:39.240 --> 3:41:43.720]  millions conservatively just three and a half four days into this operation against the new
[3:41:43.720 --> 3:41:48.440]  world order have read 20 minutes with the president i asked people to pray for us as well and pray for
[3:41:48.440 --> 3:41:52.600]  charlie and pray for myself a lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that i won't even get into
[3:41:52.600 --> 3:41:58.280]  here but we cheerfully take it all you've seen history here black ops tried to stir things
[3:41:58.280 --> 3:42:02.920]  up on tuesday didn't work and we rolled over that thanks to all of you getting the word out

[3:42:51.480 --> 3:42:56.200]  to operate all of you that serve this evil system in black ops they're putting stuff in your water
[3:42:56.200 --> 3:43:01.000]  they're putting stuff in your vaccines this is a diabolical group of eugenicists the white house
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:08.440]  science chief wrote the government textbook eco science john p holder and calling for sterilizing
[3:43:08.440 --> 3:43:15.160]  us poisoning us putting poisons in our water this is real reality is so much wilder than most people
[3:43:15.160 --> 3:43:20.760]  can even imagine and i just commend the courage of charlie sheen he's an incredible person when you
[3:43:20.760 --> 3:43:27.080]  know him in person and he's a great family man imagine he became a famous movie star he was
[3:43:27.080 --> 3:43:36.440]  like 16 in red dawn all those big movies when he was 2021 22 and all the media can do is focus
[3:43:36.440 --> 3:43:43.000]  on little petty things in his past when it's well known what goes on in washington dwarfs anything
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:49.400]  she never did or the exaggerations he is an amazing person and again i know a lot of other
[3:43:49.400 --> 3:43:54.120]  big hollywood people that i've run into over the years and i've consulted on films and been in a
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:44:02.600]  few films like scander darkly waking life when on a rider woody harrelson keanu reeves
[3:44:02.600 --> 3:44:09.960]  a lot of others i'm not going to mention even beggar because they've asked me not to they don't
[3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:15.480]  have the courage that charlie sheen has and i'm not saying they're bad people i'm just saying that
[3:44:17.160 --> 3:44:20.920]  bruce willis went public somewhat but i'm gonna leave it at that i'm gonna let bruce what bruce
[3:44:20.920 --> 3:44:25.000]  really says he believes i'm gonna just he said the same people that killed kennedy are running
[3:44:25.000 --> 3:44:29.000]  things now and he no longer follows the phony republicans or the democrats he had a paradigm
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:36.600]  shift but i challenged bruce willis to contact us and come on the show i challenge all these other
[3:44:36.600 --> 3:44:41.800]  people and i challenge people in the media and then people in music and people in entertainment
[3:44:41.800 --> 3:44:46.120]  to come public they can't stop us all and that's what the big announcement is is that we're standing
[3:44:46.120 --> 3:44:50.120]  up with courage we're taking action and charlie sheen's asking for your help right now today
[3:44:51.640 --> 3:44:55.880]  and instead of letting the media put out all their hit pieces put out their dis info use the
[3:44:55.880 --> 3:44:59.960]  nine eleven staged attacks to set up more of a police state to use homeland security against
[3:44:59.960 --> 3:45:04.360]  conservatives gun owners veterans as they now admit they're doing they built this whole police
[3:45:04.360 --> 3:45:08.920]  state from day one it was meant for the american people and the people of the world same systems

[3:45:20.440 --> 3:45:24.840]  children and grandchildren and their children have no future if we don't stop the scientific

[3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:34.280]  other great leaders but uh i want to i want to also make a key point and i want people to be
[3:46:34.280 --> 3:46:40.280]  thinking about it because the next i want people to start realizing that we need to expose the
[3:46:40.280 --> 3:46:46.440]  bill the bergs and you know more people need to be focused on those people yeah the real power
[3:46:46.440 --> 3:46:51.880]  elite not just the puppets like obama and on the flu hype they're having and on the financial
[3:46:51.880 --> 3:46:56.680]  implosion we try to cover it all those are the people that right now are probably you know looking
[3:46:56.680 --> 3:47:00.520]  at at the fact bringing game in here it's on the table go ahead no you're absolutely right those
[3:47:00.520 --> 3:47:04.920]  are the people go ahead those are the people in my heart i believe they're looking at everything
[3:47:04.920 --> 3:47:09.560]  we do and they you know they know what's going on and they're they're the ones that sit there and
[3:47:09.560 --> 3:47:15.880]  call the shots and say you know oh look they're going after our puppet obama you know you know
[3:47:15.880 --> 3:47:20.360]  we're you know they come up with the plan you know they come up with a plan of action and and you
[3:47:20.360 --> 3:47:28.920]  know that's why the media they block for obama and then obama blocks for those people that's
[3:47:28.920 --> 3:47:35.160]  right i appreciate your call great football analogy and what we put in this film two years ago
[3:47:35.160 --> 3:47:42.040]  was totally documented in the government's own textbook eco science absolutely good job dany
[3:47:42.040 --> 3:47:46.600]  with those points tom in new hampshire tom you're on the air it's great to be on with you
[3:47:47.400 --> 3:47:52.840]  it's an honor honor to have you with us you think this is the last chance for 911 truth to come
[3:47:52.840 --> 3:47:57.640]  through no we're never gonna stop we're never gonna stop they're running hit pieces on us daily
[3:47:57.640 --> 3:48:03.640]  because they're scared of us and but no i mean we do need to expose government sponsored terror to
[3:48:03.640 --> 3:48:07.720]  take that tool away from them but expose the flu i mean i was on air january saying everything
[3:48:07.720 --> 3:48:12.360]  that was going to happen i understand their operation but yes we need to all stand up and get
[3:48:12.360 --> 3:48:17.800]  involved seems like a really important year you know you've got the economic collapse coming around
[3:48:17.800 --> 3:48:23.160]  the corner and then we could have dictatorship and they meant to use 911 to get the police state
[3:48:23.160 --> 3:48:28.280]  in control so they could engineer the engineered collapse and and use that police state on us
[3:48:28.280 --> 3:48:34.280]  yes it is key but now we've got all these mainline conservative talk show host talking about obama
[3:48:34.280 --> 3:48:39.320]  that queue up forming savage saying the government may stage terror attacks or is going to do it
[3:48:39.320 --> 3:48:44.840]  that idea is now out there and we've caused a massive awakening thanks everybody taking action
[3:48:44.840 --> 3:48:49.800]  so so the news here is we're engaging them we're having an effect we have power that's my main
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:56.520]  message so why do people in the media go along because they're whores and they have mortgages
[3:48:56.520 --> 3:49:04.760]  and they enjoy the power trips of being on tv and they haven't they just are worldly i appreciate
[3:49:04.760 --> 3:49:09.800]  your call really good points tom adrian and rhoda island adrian you're on the air hey alice it's
[3:49:09.800 --> 3:49:14.680]  great to be on good to have you i'm a big fan of most of your work especially the way you fight
[3:49:14.680 --> 3:49:19.560]  back against uh you know the orwellian perpetual state of war we have gone on this country so thank
[3:49:19.560 --> 3:49:25.960]  you for that um that being said though i have to contribute uh jeffersonian patriotic dissenting
[3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:31.080]  voice here today um just specifically i've noticed in the last week like there have been a couple
[3:49:31.080 --> 3:49:36.040]  articles on your info warsite that have been a little bit intolerant of homosexuality it seemed
[3:49:37.480 --> 3:49:42.840]  well sir i appreciate your call look i'm not up here with bashing people hating people but we
[3:49:42.840 --> 3:49:48.520]  posted articles about how they have the quote lesbian rangers in canada who go around harassing
[3:49:48.520 --> 3:49:57.320]  heterosexuals and trying to bring in hate speech loss so that's what i'm against okay i'm against
[3:49:57.320 --> 3:50:05.160]  guilds of people getting together and and i mean with the cps they take heterosexual family
[3:50:05.160 --> 3:50:10.040]  homeschoolers kids on record and give it to the gay and lesbian families so i'm not saying all the
[3:50:10.040 --> 3:50:15.320]  gay people are involved in this but there are gangs of different gangs of people that's how
[3:50:15.320 --> 3:50:20.200]  humans arrange themselves and it's wrong and they shouldn't teach anything sexual to six
[3:50:20.200 --> 3:50:25.080]  or seven year olds in schools there's there's recruiting going on and just stay away from
[3:50:25.080 --> 3:50:33.160]  our kids man regardless with any type of stuff all this recruiting all this agenda okay gay folks
[3:50:33.160 --> 3:50:42.040]  don't have children so they replicate by recruitment and that's fine with consenting adults but just
[3:50:42.040 --> 3:50:46.760]  look there's a lot i mean there's a lot of really bad stuff and out of control self-destructive
[3:50:46.760 --> 3:50:52.680]  stuff gay men have the lowest life expectancy in the country even below black men who are next
[3:50:52.680 --> 3:50:57.080]  i mean it's a it's it's you know i care about these people but it's very destructive what's
[3:50:57.080 --> 3:51:04.840]  going on okay very very simple there's a guy named mz in santa cruz california who owns one of our
[3:51:04.840 --> 3:51:09.640]  affiliate radio stations he got laid off from a job he loved many years ago he was devastated
[3:51:09.640 --> 3:51:14.120]  but it taught him a lesson very early in life that even when you do a great job for someone
[3:51:14.120 --> 3:51:18.840]  and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day there is no job security you are
[3:51:18.840 --> 3:51:24.040]  always in danger of losing your job unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own
[3:51:24.040 --> 3:51:30.840]  business since you are the boss nobody can fire you so mz has been his own boss for over 37 years
[3:51:30.840 --> 3:51:36.360]  and he is passionate about turning other people on to the joys and benefits of working for themselves
[3:51:36.360 --> 3:51:41.560]  and not for others mz wants to tell you about a low-cost home business opportunity involving
