[00:00:04.864 --> 00:00:09.685]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.685 --> 00:00:11.285]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:12.826]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:17.007]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.007 --> 00:00:21.107]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.693]  We're going to get some updates today from 9-11 truth groups across the country like Stuart Howe out in We Are Change Los Angeles.
[00:00:43.693 --> 00:01:01.361]  We're going to get some updates from the ground in New York City as well as 9-11 truthers all over the country and the planet come out in full force exposing the fraud that is the self-inflicted wound false flag attacks of eight years ago this morning.
[00:01:03.826 --> 00:01:18.755]  Eight years ago, this afternoon or this evening in some time zones around the world, Charlie Sheen will be live on air with us today at 1.30 Central Standard Time, 2.30 Eastern, 12.30 Mountain,
[00:01:25.393 --> 00:01:38.704]  So you can certainly tune in for that today, coming up live, 1.30 Central Standard Time, Charlie Sheen, with huge developments, huge revelations.
[00:01:38.704 --> 00:01:41.106]  Believe me, you're going to want to tune in for this.
[00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:47.391]  I told everybody back on Monday with that YouTube video that 20 minutes with the President, his open letter, was only the beginning.
[00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:54.197]  That this would be the biggest media event that I ever officiated over or oversaw.
[00:01:55.325 --> 00:02:05.471]  And then Tuesday, you saw the letter, you heard the audio interview, the live interview, yesterday, and the release of the video.
[00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:07.953]  Charlie Sheen's video addressed to the President.
[00:02:07.953 --> 00:02:18.799]  It's being aired on television in the United States, it's being aired in England, it's being aired in Europe, it's being aired in the East, in Asia.
[00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.002]  It is linked up on major news websites like the London Telegraph and The Sun.
[00:02:26.892 --> 00:02:49.470]  Massive, massive, massive, massive, massive media coverage dwarfing just three and a half, four days into our release of this operation against the lie of 9-11, the lie of the official story, the lie that was carried out to set up a global police state, just three and a half, four days into this operation,
[00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:55.934]  It is already bigger than the last time Charlie Sheen went public on this radio show.
[00:02:55.934 --> 00:02:58.077]  We commend his courage.
[00:02:58.077 --> 00:03:07.309]  But you will get further revelations when he joins us live today.
[00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:08.771]  Coming up in two and a half hours.
[00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:21.740]  We're also going to cover all of the other important news that is taking place and going on.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:30.042]  White House blames media false reports for scare resulting from Coast Guard exercise in the Potomac.
[00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:36.863]  Just a mile or so away from the White House, Coast Guard training in Potomac causes scare.
[00:03:36.863 --> 00:03:39.504]  Official denies shots were fired.
[00:03:39.504 --> 00:03:40.744]  So who knows what's really going on.
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.645]  Also, White House resists offering details on financing health plan.
[00:03:48.645 --> 00:03:50.627]  This is from Bloomberg.
[00:03:50.627 --> 00:03:58.655]  There's more disinformation saying that it doesn't cover illegal aliens when the federal government and state governments are already doing that.
[00:03:58.655 --> 00:03:59.555]  And it clearly does.
[00:04:01.064 --> 00:04:06.089]  Obama is setting the stage for using budget maneuver to pass health reform.
[00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:12.075]  He's going to try to tag it on with all of the pork and ram it through, even if it's very unpopular.
[00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:18.861]  CNN, of course, yesterday caught putting out a fake poll where they said they sampled Republicans and Democrats 50-50.
[00:04:18.861 --> 00:04:22.445]  Before and after his speech, it was actually two-thirds Democrats, one-third Republicans.
[00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:23.326]  Complete fraud.
[00:04:25.447 --> 00:04:27.649]  So we're going to be going over all of this today.
[00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:34.153]  Also an anti-abortion activist shot in front of a high school in Michigan.
[00:04:34.153 --> 00:04:38.436]  Will the media wring its hands and cry and whine about this for 10 years and make movies about it?
[00:04:38.436 --> 00:04:40.858]  Probably not.
[00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:49.904]  A lot of other financial and global news coming up and 9-11 truth signatures stand behind call for new investigation.
[00:04:51.175 --> 00:04:54.998]  Hannity attacks Charlie Sheen over video message to Obama.
[00:04:54.998 --> 00:04:56.180]  So does O'Reilly.
[00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:59.583]  This thing has gone supernova!
[00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:03.632]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.632 --> 00:05:08.957]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:11.019]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:16.023]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.023 --> 00:05:17.204]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.204 --> 00:05:18.325]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.325 --> 00:05:20.207]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.207 --> 00:05:21.288]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:23.310]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.811]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:24.811 --> 00:05:26.331]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.331 --> 00:05:31.593]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.593 --> 00:05:35.195]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:38.656]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.016 --> 00:05:40.237]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.237 --> 00:05:41.137]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.137 --> 00:05:42.238]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.238 --> 00:05:43.159]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:44.259]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.321]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:50.443]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:50.443 --> 00:05:51.604]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[00:05:51.604 --> 00:05:55.326]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[00:06:08.882 --> 00:06:10.143]  Or at least we thought we did.
[00:06:10.143 --> 00:06:17.212]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[00:06:17.212 --> 00:06:25.722]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:33.193]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[00:06:33.193 --> 00:06:36.354]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:42.137]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[00:06:42.137 --> 00:06:45.219]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.
[00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:51.262]  Download Truth Rising at PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide.
[00:06:51.262 --> 00:06:53.643]  Or order the DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:06:54.155 --> 00:07:00.539]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:06.503]  Did you know many vitamin and mineral supplements on the market are made from rocks and ground-up shells?
[00:07:06.503 --> 00:07:07.284]  Think about that.
[00:07:07.284 --> 00:07:10.406]  Would you swallow a handful of shells you found at the beach?
[00:07:10.406 --> 00:07:13.608]  Our body wasn't designed to digest rocks and shells.
[00:07:13.608 --> 00:07:23.395]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman, formulator of Chews for Health, a delicious-tasting, chewable dietary supplement derived from 16 fruits, vegetables, and antioxidants.
[00:07:23.835 --> 00:07:29.681]  Unlike hard-to-digest pills, Choose for Health is a convenient chewable which allows for better digestion.
[00:07:29.681 --> 00:07:30.862]  The choice is yours.
[00:07:30.862 --> 00:07:36.467]  Swallow rocks and shells to supplement your diet or a natural chewable product you can better digest.
[00:07:36.467 --> 00:07:37.488]  Choose for Health.
[00:07:37.488 --> 00:07:41.532]  The world's first superfruit, sea vegetable, antioxidant chewable.
[00:07:41.532 --> 00:07:43.995]  Whole food nutrition, not rocks and shells.
[00:07:45.918 --> 00:07:48.122]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:07:48.122 --> 00:07:52.609]  Call now and receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's Unbalanced Diet.
[00:07:52.609 --> 00:07:52.829]  1-800-210-1922.
[00:07:52.829 --> 00:07:53.731]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.172]  I believe the title was Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.
[00:08:20.594 --> 00:08:24.798]  70% of family members' questions were never answered during the 9-11 Commission Report.
[00:08:24.798 --> 00:08:27.440]  Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean said they were set up to fail.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.821]  I mean, I remember the Commission.
[00:08:28.821 --> 00:08:29.602]  It's a scam.
[00:08:29.602 --> 00:08:31.784]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[00:08:31.784 --> 00:08:34.366]  The questions, Mr. President.
[00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:37.388]  The questions.
[00:08:37.388 --> 00:08:42.412]  Building 7 ablaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse.
[00:08:42.412 --> 00:08:42.753]  Building 7?
[00:08:45.037 --> 00:08:47.258]  Well, no, there's number seven coming down.
[00:08:47.258 --> 00:08:55.243]  The excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being demolished, and they wired very carefully for days, and it's a very careful operation.
[00:08:55.243 --> 00:09:05.970]  For the third time today, in reminiscence of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.112]  One of the things they do is pull it.
[00:09:09.112 --> 00:09:12.574]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building.
[00:09:13.815 --> 00:09:17.799]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:09:17.799 --> 00:09:19.921]  Well, only really what you already know.
[00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:21.643]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[00:09:21.643 --> 00:09:30.852]  We're getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7, in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:36.656]  Vanishing airplane.
[00:09:36.656 --> 00:09:42.858]  From my close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.
[00:09:42.858 --> 00:09:53.003]  The only sight is the actual side of the building that's crashed in, and as I said, the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand.
[00:09:53.003 --> 00:10:02.948]  There are no large tail sections, wing sections, a fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around, which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon.
[00:10:04.574 --> 00:10:09.087]  Firefighters and police describing explosions.
[00:10:09.087 --> 00:10:09.569]  A lot of them.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.042]  Even if there was no secondary explosives in the building.
[00:10:27.042 --> 00:10:28.562]  It sounded like gunfire.
[00:10:28.562 --> 00:10:30.063]  You know, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[00:10:30.063 --> 00:10:32.724]  And then all of a sudden, three big explosions.
[00:10:32.724 --> 00:10:36.426]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[00:10:36.426 --> 00:10:38.567]  To me it sounded like... To me it sounded like...
[00:10:39.611 --> 00:10:40.311]  An explosion?
[00:10:40.311 --> 00:10:57.938]  Chief Albert Turrey told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place, and then an hour after, there was another explosion in one of the towers here.
[00:10:57.938 --> 00:11:01.919]  Sabel Edmonds, FBI Translator, breaking her gag order.
[00:11:02.683 --> 00:11:06.684]  All our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban.
[00:11:06.684 --> 00:11:13.386]  We did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th.
[00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:19.087]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Rawapendi for kidney dialysis treatment.
[00:11:19.087 --> 00:11:20.568]  The military had him surrounded.
[00:11:20.568 --> 00:11:26.809]  They were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be watched carefully and looked after.
[00:11:26.809 --> 00:11:29.270]  NORAD standing down.
[00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:30.010]  Where were the planes?
[00:11:33.592 --> 00:11:36.734]  Let's get on now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11.
[00:11:36.734 --> 00:11:40.055]  A mysterious plane was seen flying right over the president's residence.
[00:11:40.055 --> 00:11:42.897]  The E-4Bs over New York and Washington.
[00:11:42.897 --> 00:11:45.078]  Otherwise known as the Doomsday Planes.
[00:11:45.078 --> 00:11:47.619]  It has never been officially explained.
[00:11:47.619 --> 00:11:52.562]  Cell phones working at impossible altitudes.
[00:11:52.562 --> 00:11:58.485]  Solicitor General Ted Olson receiving phone calls that the FBI says were never made.
[00:11:58.485 --> 00:11:59.645]  What happened during that call?
[00:11:59.645 --> 00:12:02.607]  This is the only information we have on these terrorists.
[00:12:04.742 --> 00:12:06.944]  She was able to call him twice.
[00:12:06.944 --> 00:12:10.966]  How she could pull that off, we don't know, but she did.
[00:12:10.966 --> 00:12:13.448]  These are the questions, Mr. President.
[00:12:13.448 --> 00:12:14.989]  These are the questions.
[00:12:14.989 --> 00:12:16.630]  They go on and on.
[00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:23.195]  Good afternoon, Mr. President.
[00:12:23.195 --> 00:12:31.740]  I come to you today representing the families of the victims of September 11th, as well as millions of my fellow Americans.
[00:12:31.740 --> 00:12:33.882]  Hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter
[00:12:34.639 --> 00:12:35.459]  We're good to go.
[00:12:57.703 --> 00:13:07.610]  The 9-11 Commission itself says they were lied to, deceived, and essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation.
[00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.433]  The people of the United States and the world demand the truth, sir.
[00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:13.054]  We have to continuously ask questions.
[00:13:13.054 --> 00:13:13.875]  That's what a patriot does.
[00:13:13.875 --> 00:13:15.676]  That's what a true American does.
[00:13:15.676 --> 00:13:20.199]  We ask questions.
[00:13:20.199 --> 00:13:23.842]  You, sir, have the power as well as the responsibility
[00:13:24.537 --> 00:13:32.480]  To initiate a truly independent congressional investigation into the events of 9-11, as well as its aftermath.
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.721]  We want our country back, Mr. President.
[00:13:34.721 --> 00:13:43.945]  Therefore, I'm not just calling on you and your team, I'm calling on each and every American citizen to wake up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[00:13:43.945 --> 00:13:46.126]  We're counting on you, Mr. President.
[00:13:46.126 --> 00:13:47.066]  Be on the right side of history.
[00:13:52.948 --> 00:14:04.693]  I don't know.
[00:14:06.955 --> 00:14:10.897]  Are you now saying that they weren't asking to block an investigation?
[00:14:10.897 --> 00:14:18.000]  An investigation must not interfere with the ongoing efforts to prevent the next attack.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.381]  Senator Tom Bashel said last week that he called him several times and urged him not to do this.
[00:14:22.381 --> 00:14:22.641]  We are live!
[00:14:22.641 --> 00:14:23.182]  It is September 11th, 2009.
[00:14:23.182 --> 00:14:24.062]  Eight years after the tragic attacks.
[00:14:36.112 --> 00:14:45.358]  It appears that a PSYOP is going on right now on the Potomac River in Washington, D.C.
[00:14:45.358 --> 00:14:52.663]  Remember how they did the Air Force One photo op flyover that flew within a few hundred yards of major skyscrapers?
[00:14:52.663 --> 00:14:57.447]  And then it turned out that it was classified details and the White House had ordered
[00:14:58.777 --> 00:15:06.118]  The New York City Police and other emergency agencies not to tell Mayor Bloomberg weeks before.
[00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:13.740]  They said do not tell Mayor Bloomberg and do not tell the rest of the city departments about what we're about to do with this flyover.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:22.141]  Now that is not a stinking photo op because they want a photo of Air Force One without Obama in it.
[00:15:22.141 --> 00:15:27.442]  They have several Air Force Ones flying through the middle of lower Manhattan.
[00:15:30.109 --> 00:15:46.125]  And that didn't come out for a week that the White House and the National Security Council were telling the city, telling the police, I thought they worked for the mayor, I thought they worked for the people, I thought they worked for the incorporated city under state law.
[00:15:46.125 --> 00:15:50.129]  Well they do, but that shows how federalized things are.
[00:15:50.129 --> 00:15:50.769]  Remember that?
[00:15:51.681 --> 00:15:59.307]  And then it came out that the highest levels of the White House were involved, telling the police this is secret, because they wanted to scare everyone.
[00:15:59.307 --> 00:16:04.751]  They wanted to have the city say, we don't know what's going on for that first day, so everyone would freak out.
[00:16:04.751 --> 00:16:08.053]  And so it would invoke the memories of 9-11 again.
[00:16:08.053 --> 00:16:10.855]  It was a test to bring back the memories of 9-11.
[00:16:10.855 --> 00:16:19.542]  And then this morning, and I believe the Coast Guard isn't involved in this, they send the Coast Guard out to do some type of live fire drill on the Potomac.
[00:16:20.546 --> 00:16:32.638]  Just a mile or so away from the White House, in the middle of all those monuments, they have scores of boats running around, reports in mainstream AP, Reuters, you name it, of shots being fired.
[00:16:32.638 --> 00:16:39.885]  And then they have the Vice Admiral go on TV live, he's on TV live right now, and say, look, they just told us to do this drill, you know, we do these a few times a year.
[00:16:41.581 --> 00:16:49.852]  But see, CNN, the main PSYOP network, Fox is kind of like the comic book network of ridiculous propaganda, but CNN is some more slick.
[00:16:49.852 --> 00:16:51.775]  It's come out, the Pentagon openly runs it.
[00:16:51.775 --> 00:16:52.276]  That came out in 2000.
[00:16:54.389 --> 00:17:00.990]  Anderson Cooper's admitted CIA, quote, graduated out of the CIA out of college, was recruited, and then, quote, got out of the CIA.
[00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:01.871]  Yeah, right.
[00:17:01.871 --> 00:17:06.711]  And he's the heir to the Astor fortune, just like Tucker Carlson's the heir to one of those big fortunes.
[00:17:06.711 --> 00:17:08.412]  It's ridiculous.
[00:17:08.412 --> 00:17:13.193]  So that was a PSYOP to test re-invoking fears on 9-11.
[00:17:13.193 --> 00:17:23.115]  So while Obama's giving a speech at the Pentagon on one side of the Potomac, on the other side you got the White House.
[00:17:23.115 --> 00:17:23.975]  They're in that big river.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:36.888]  You've got all these patrol boats running around, reports of shots fired, all sorts of hysteria, and CNN's right on it to videotape it live and send it out as it's happening.
[00:17:36.888 --> 00:17:37.749]  Oh, how convenient!
[00:17:38.956 --> 00:17:42.478]  To create this idea of fear again.
[00:17:42.478 --> 00:17:44.299]  No doubt this is staged.
[00:17:44.299 --> 00:17:46.621]  Absolutely guarantee.
[00:17:46.621 --> 00:17:49.463]  But that's how compartmentalization works.
[00:17:49.463 --> 00:17:52.865]  I will also guarantee you the Coast Guard knows nothing about it.
[00:17:52.865 --> 00:17:54.666]  They just follow orders.
[00:17:54.666 --> 00:17:56.467]  It's a drill.
[00:17:56.467 --> 00:18:02.311]  Now was this going to be a drill they used to bootleg a real terror attack on the President while he was at the Pentagon?
[00:18:04.591 --> 00:18:07.313]  They used a drill to move 44,000 U.S.
[00:18:07.313 --> 00:18:15.960]  troops and 18,000 British troops into position in the two months before 9-11 in the countries surrounding Afghanistan.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:19.623]  And to move in the Carrier Task Force attack groups, two of them.
[00:18:19.623 --> 00:18:28.010]  Then Bush, one day before 9-11, source Newsweek, MSNBC, signed the launch orders to attack Afghanistan in three days.
[00:18:29.673 --> 00:18:31.134]  He signed that one day before 9-11.
[00:18:31.134 --> 00:18:37.660]  That way he could come out, announce Afghanistan did it on 9-11, and then a day and a half later launch the attacks.
[00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:40.603]  Completely staged.
[00:18:40.603 --> 00:18:56.057]  That'd be like if you saw a hundred police cars show up outside your door, and then you watched a cop drop a brick of cocaine in your backyard, and then when they raid you and drag you away, you're saying, well, I saw the police arrive before you even planted that.
[00:18:58.439 --> 00:18:59.700]  You can think of a better analogy.
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:04.522]  It's like the fire department showing up to a house before it burns down.
[00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:06.103]  Forty-four thousand U.S.
[00:19:06.103 --> 00:19:19.510]  troops, two carrier strike groups in the Gulf in the two months before 9-11.
[00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:25.273]  So the White House calls up and says to the police, Homeland Security says, don't tell the mayor, don't tell the city about this.
[00:19:26.172 --> 00:19:30.135]  We're going to fly a jet to the middle of the city.
[00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:33.797]  In some cases, 250 yards away from skyscrapers.
[00:19:33.797 --> 00:19:36.599]  Incredibly dangerous.
[00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:38.540]  And that's why I said, we don't know what happened.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.221]  Oh, it was a photo op, and then it came out.
[00:19:40.221 --> 00:19:41.803]  No, they staged the whole deal.
[00:19:41.803 --> 00:19:43.904]  And they're testing PSYOPs.
[00:19:43.904 --> 00:19:47.646]  And I want to say thank you to people controlling
[00:19:49.468 --> 00:19:52.209]  Barack Obama, I mean, at least they didn't fly planes into buildings again.
[00:19:52.209 --> 00:20:00.692]  I mean, at least they're just doing PSYOPs like Gulf of Tonkin, where they say they attacked the Shebs, but the Shebs never even got attacked.
[00:20:00.692 --> 00:20:08.474]  Robert Beatle's new book, Here's What You Do, was written for anyone who wants to survive the upcoming and ongoing financial storm.
[00:20:08.474 --> 00:20:13.536]  Get prepared and go to here'swhatyoudo.net and buy the $6 book.
[00:20:13.536 --> 00:20:19.058]  He is also trying to help us by running for Congress to stop the thievery and loss of liberties.
[00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:24.023]  Please arm yourself with his guide and go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:24.023 --> 00:20:26.166]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:28.028]  Hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:28.028 --> 00:20:30.471]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:20:30.471 --> 00:20:32.073]  Wondering about your retirement portfolio?
[00:20:32.073 --> 00:20:36.618]  Is your financial advisor experienced enough to combat rising interest rates, taxes, inflation?
[00:20:36.618 --> 00:20:40.242]  Stop guessing and go to the expert, Robert Chapman of the International Forecaster.
[00:20:40.342 --> 00:20:40.582]  We're good.
[00:21:00.863 --> 00:21:07.529]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:21:07.529 --> 00:21:15.655]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:21:15.655 --> 00:21:23.822]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:21:23.822 --> 00:21:28.566]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:34.132]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:21:34.132 --> 00:21:38.477]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:21:38.477 --> 00:21:39.559]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:39.559 --> 00:21:44.084]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:21:44.084 --> 00:21:45.485]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:21:48.949 --> 00:21:51.950]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.210]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.850]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:57.631]  It's here.
[00:21:57.631 --> 00:22:09.033]  After a year in production and traveling to distant lands, my new film Terror Storm is complete.
[00:22:09.033 --> 00:22:16.674]  Shocking declassified government documents prove that western governments are orchestrating terror attacks against their own populations as a pretext to enslave them.
[00:22:17.389 --> 00:22:24.831]  Terror Storm proves that not only was 9-11 an inside job, but the attacks of 7-7 in London were carried out by British intelligence.
[00:22:24.831 --> 00:22:36.554]  Terror Storm chronicles the lies that took us to war in Iran, the White House program to disseminate fake news, NSA spying, secret police torture, the latest 9-11 information, and much, much more.
[00:22:36.554 --> 00:22:40.515]  Terror Storm is the definitive guide to the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:22:40.515 --> 00:22:42.796]  It's an anthology of government crimes.
[00:22:42.796 --> 00:22:46.637]  Terror Storm is a film that everyone who wants to be truly informed must see.

[00:22:59.958 --> 00:23:01.640]  Okay folks, quiz time.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:12.069]  What resource takes care of your food needs at a moment's notice most of the year, is easily preserved for the rest of the year, is nutritious, abundant, forever GMO-free, and is free for the taking?
[00:23:12.069 --> 00:23:12.850]  Give up?
[00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:15.172]  Your answer is wild edible food.
[00:23:15.172 --> 00:23:21.298]  With Linda Runyon's whole enchilada package on your shelf, you'll never be high and dry when everyone else is up the creek without a paddle.
[00:23:21.298 --> 00:23:21.578]  In fact,
[00:23:24.735 --> 00:23:25.275]  We're good to go.
[00:23:50.489 --> 00:23:52.230]  You look like an angel.
[00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:53.370]  Walk like an angel.
[00:23:53.370 --> 00:23:54.151]  Talk like an angel.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:23.603]  You look like an angel.
[00:24:47.706 --> 00:24:56.969]  Alright, it looks like Charlie Sheen is taking cues from Van Jones in a video message published on radio talk show host Alex Jones' website.
[00:24:56.969 --> 00:25:03.511]  The actor recently requested a meeting with President Obama to urge him to open an investigation into the 9-11 attacks.
[00:25:03.511 --> 00:25:10.733]  Now, Sheen says they were an inside job and that the 9-11 commission report was, quote, a blatant work of manipulation.
[00:25:10.733 --> 00:25:11.294]  Hey, wait a minute.
[00:25:11.294 --> 00:25:14.875]  Maybe Charlie Sheen could fill Obama's next czar vacancy.
[00:25:14.875 --> 00:25:15.295]  Stay put.
[00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:23.879]  And then they went on to talk trash.
[00:25:23.879 --> 00:25:29.422]  We're going to play more of these clips as the establishment media takes the bait, hook, line, and sinker.
[00:25:29.422 --> 00:25:34.904]  Now you're seeing why I said this is the biggest thing I've ever done in the Monday video.
[00:25:34.904 --> 00:25:36.165]  In fact, who's cued that up?
[00:25:36.165 --> 00:25:38.006]  Because some people never listen to what I say.
[00:25:38.006 --> 00:25:39.827]  People are like, this letter is it?
[00:25:40.919 --> 00:25:42.439]  And I said no!
[00:25:42.439 --> 00:26:05.184]  The letter is meant to get the media's attention so that the debate will be about Obama not investigating the fact that six of the ten commissioners on the 9-11 Commission, even in the Washington Post and in books they wrote themselves, say it was a cover-up, a criminal lie, that there should be a criminal investigation, not just a new independent commission.
[00:26:09.397 --> 00:26:10.637]  Let's go ahead and play O'Reilly.
[00:26:10.637 --> 00:26:13.858]  Here it is.
[00:26:13.858 --> 00:26:14.598]  The Patriot.
[00:26:14.598 --> 00:26:16.699]  On the 10-minute front, actor Charlie Sheen.
[00:26:16.699 --> 00:26:18.359]  He's a bit out there on political matters.
[00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:22.540]  He continues to believe 9-11 was an American conspiracy.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:24.440]  America deserves better.
[00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:25.781]  I mean, come on.
[00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:26.601]  Come on, people.
[00:26:26.601 --> 00:26:32.522]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant mark of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[00:26:32.522 --> 00:26:32.942]  Come on.
[00:26:32.942 --> 00:26:34.363]  The time is now.
[00:26:34.363 --> 00:26:35.863]  Demand the truth.
[00:26:44.021 --> 00:26:46.783]  You know, that's not going to work, O'Reilly.
[00:26:46.783 --> 00:27:01.570]  The majority of the 9-11 victims' families and the heads of those groups have been on this show and have protested outside the White House and at Ground Zero and they're there today, like Bob McIlvain and others who lost his son and Bill Doyle, saying 9-11 is a total inside job.
[00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:02.730]  Period.
[00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:03.271]  It's you!
[00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:26.572]  It's you individuals out there, you absolute pieces of trash that wrap yourselves in the American flag for your police state and you used the lie of 9-11 to say Saddam Hussein, the former CIA asset, had carried out the attacks and he had nukes and WMDs and yellow cake from Niger.
[00:27:26.572 --> 00:27:27.032]  It's you!
[00:27:31.653 --> 00:27:37.019]  That have the blood of over 1,300,000 dead Iraqis and 5,000 dead U.S.
[00:27:37.019 --> 00:27:39.381]  troops on your hands.
[00:27:39.381 --> 00:27:41.083]  And by the way, that's a skewed number too.
[00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:41.924]  They cook everything.
[00:27:41.924 --> 00:27:43.686]  It's like the unemployment numbers.
[00:27:43.686 --> 00:27:52.475]  If you die from wounds sustained in Afghanistan or Iraq, outside of Iraq or Afghanistan, previously they would count you as a casualty of the war.
[00:27:53.709 --> 00:27:59.775]  It was more than 15,000 over a year ago the last time I saw the numbers of real dead US troops.
[00:27:59.775 --> 00:28:05.420]  They just don't count it if you die in Rammstein or if you die back in England or back in the United States.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.085]  They don't count it if you're dying on a medevac being flown out of country.
[00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:14.082]  So, I don't know what it is right now.
[00:28:14.082 --> 00:28:15.302]  It's very hard to find those numbers.
[00:28:15.302 --> 00:28:17.682]  Last time it was 15,000 and change.
[00:28:17.682 --> 00:28:21.143]  Each piece of that change, a human life.
[00:28:21.143 --> 00:28:22.684]  And it's not just loose change to us.
[00:28:22.684 --> 00:28:33.326]  These are human beings who really believed your lie that Saddam Hussein had hit us and hit us hard and they went over there and fought for what they believe was this country!
[00:28:33.326 --> 00:28:35.707]  You use those patriots like toilet paper!
[00:28:37.264 --> 00:28:45.727]  And you wrap them around you to give yourself the allure and the light and the gleam of a hero.
[00:28:45.727 --> 00:28:51.028]  It's disgusting what you murderers do.
[00:28:51.028 --> 00:28:56.010]  And you were aiding and abetting these murderers, Hannity and O'Reilly and all the rest of you attacking them.
[00:28:56.010 --> 00:28:56.590]  Let me tell you something.
[00:28:57.708 --> 00:29:01.870]  We're not just going to let you write your hit pieces and have your hit piece TV shows against us without answering us.
[00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:05.091]  That's why we've launched this offensive against you.
[00:29:05.091 --> 00:29:06.472]  The people are rallying everywhere.
[00:29:06.472 --> 00:29:08.053]  The excitement is incredible.
[00:29:08.053 --> 00:29:10.954]  One of my sales guys is in a band.
[00:29:10.954 --> 00:29:12.915]  Nothing to do with 9-11 Truth.
[00:29:12.915 --> 00:29:17.897]  And they had women and other people coming up to them saying, have you heard about Charlie Sheen?
[00:29:17.897 --> 00:29:18.857]  Have you heard about Alex Jones?
[00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:19.998]  They're taking action.
[00:29:19.998 --> 00:29:22.679]  It's a revolution against the lie of 9-11.
[00:29:22.679 --> 00:29:23.939]  And I'm getting calls.
[00:29:23.939 --> 00:29:25.500]  This is happening everywhere.
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:26.961]  And young men are trying to wear
[00:29:28.655 --> 00:29:32.696]  Investigate 9-11 t-shirts to schools, and they're being kicked out.
[00:29:32.696 --> 00:29:38.637]  They're not allowed to give speeches to their speech classes, and that's only going to cause people to speak out that much more.
[00:29:38.637 --> 00:29:47.058]  So we're not laying down while you murderers carry out more terror attacks, and we're going to expose the lie that is 9-11, the fable.
[00:29:47.058 --> 00:29:51.259]  Your lies and deception are coming to a halt.
[00:29:51.259 --> 00:29:52.639]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.639 --> 00:29:55.179]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.179 --> 00:29:57.840]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.213 --> 00:30:04.454]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[00:30:04.454 --> 00:30:06.454]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[00:30:06.454 --> 00:30:14.976]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[00:30:14.976 --> 00:30:20.518]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[00:30:20.518 --> 00:30:22.138]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[00:30:22.378 --> 00:30:28.900]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:39.943]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:40.403]  That's right.
[00:30:40.643 --> 00:30:43.946]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:31:06.972 --> 00:31:14.535]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[00:31:14.535 --> 00:31:21.097]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:31:21.097 --> 00:31:23.098]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:31:23.098 --> 00:31:25.619]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:31:25.619 --> 00:31:36.563]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:31:37.179 --> 00:31:38.840]  It's not about left or right.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.701]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:31:40.701 --> 00:31:47.626]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:31:47.626 --> 00:31:55.891]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:31:55.891 --> 00:31:57.452]  The Obama Deception.
[00:31:57.452 --> 00:31:58.653]  The people strike back.
[00:32:00.441 --> 00:32:03.228]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[00:32:03.228 --> 00:32:04.471]  I've been so sick!
[00:32:04.471 --> 00:32:06.155]  Will the life change tea help me?
[00:32:06.155 --> 00:32:07.559]  Our answer is always the same.
[00:32:08.007 --> 00:32:14.112]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[00:32:14.112 --> 00:32:20.017]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[00:32:20.017 --> 00:32:24.520]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:25.942]  We use results.
[00:32:25.942 --> 00:32:30.706]  Life Change Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[00:32:30.706 --> 00:32:34.969]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[00:32:35.305 --> 00:32:39.167]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[00:32:39.167 --> 00:32:43.070]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:48.012]  Our number is 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:32:48.012 --> 00:32:51.955]  Again, that's 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[00:32:51.955 --> 00:32:54.776]  Or you can order online at GetTheTee.com.
[00:32:54.776 --> 00:32:57.318]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[00:32:57.318 --> 00:32:59.939]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[00:33:20.929 --> 00:33:28.470]  Charlie Sheen coming up live at 1.30 Central Standard Time today.
[00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:31.651]  That's in T-minus two hours.
[00:33:31.651 --> 00:33:32.731]  He'll be live with us.
[00:33:36.658 --> 00:33:38.519]  You definitely want to stay tuned for that.
[00:33:38.519 --> 00:33:39.939]  I know ABC News called.
[00:33:39.939 --> 00:33:42.000]  A lot of other folks called from the mainstream media.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.100]  They're going to be tuned in today.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:47.322]  There's going to be some big announcements.
[00:33:47.322 --> 00:33:50.743]  Because we are just expanding this operation.
[00:33:50.743 --> 00:33:53.805]  Operation Truth.
[00:33:53.805 --> 00:33:56.646]  Operation Smash the Lies.
[00:33:56.646 --> 00:34:01.187]  As I said Monday in my message, I said, what's coming out Tuesday morning at 8 a.m.
[00:34:01.187 --> 00:34:02.368]  is only the beginning.
[00:34:03.356 --> 00:34:12.042]  And then you saw the taped interview with Charlie Sheen, a live interview with Charlie Sheen, an abbreviated one, the big announcements are coming up.
[00:34:12.042 --> 00:34:18.727]  You witnessed the video release that I knew was going to be the biggest, that's the big one, his direct appeal to the President.
[00:34:18.727 --> 00:34:27.053]  That incredible video job that Aaron did, that video is just off the charts, it's gone super viral everywhere.
[00:34:27.053 --> 00:34:31.637]  All these big newspapers and TV stations are just grabbing and airing large parts of it or in whole right now.
[00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:36.532]  This is going better than I thought it would, though I knew it was going to be big.
[00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:39.254]  I could feel a tremor in the force.
[00:34:39.254 --> 00:34:46.519]  So, let's go ahead and, just for the record, I told you it was going to be big.
[00:34:46.519 --> 00:34:50.481]  The trolls, the disinfo agents tried to spin it and say, what, this letter is everything?
[00:34:50.481 --> 00:35:00.568]  No, what you're seeing now is the big announcements, and I told you that the day before we released this huge story.
[00:35:00.568 --> 00:35:00.908]  Here it is.
[00:35:02.401 --> 00:35:09.371]  Folks, it's Monday, September 7, 2009, and I'm taping this special message because a lot of people are on the edge of their seat.
[00:35:09.371 --> 00:35:16.221]  In the last few days, I've been telling you we have a huge announcement, a huge story, a huge guest coming up on Tuesday, September 8, 2009.
[00:35:18.223 --> 00:35:22.224]  If you're on the edge of your seat, imagine how I'm on the edge of my seat knowing what I know.
[00:35:22.224 --> 00:35:28.805]  The information you're going to witness tomorrow took a lot of courage and a lot of time and it's revolutionary.
[00:35:28.805 --> 00:35:31.806]  It's going to be a big national news story, there's no doubt in that.
[00:35:31.806 --> 00:35:39.548]  But if people get involved, if people realize the revolutionary information and the revolutionary development and get involved,
[00:35:40.208 --> 00:35:43.230]  We may take this country and this world back from the globalists.
[00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:45.331]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a huge announcement.
[00:35:45.331 --> 00:35:50.155]  In 14 years on radio, this is the biggest thing I've done, the biggest thing I've been involved in.
[00:35:51.192 --> 00:35:55.255]  We've broken a lot of huge stories, had a lot of really amazing guests on.
[00:35:55.255 --> 00:35:57.017]  This is bigger than all of that.
[00:35:57.017 --> 00:35:59.058]  This is the biggest thing I've ever done.
[00:35:59.058 --> 00:36:02.461]  Be sure and join me Tuesday, September 8th, 2009, 11 a.m.
[00:36:02.461 --> 00:36:06.504]  at InfoWars.com on the radio.
[00:36:06.504 --> 00:36:12.829]  Earlier in the morning, you're going to see some posts on the website that give you a big idea, but not the whole story.
[00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:15.592]  And throughout the week, there's just going to be more and more developments.
[00:36:16.252 --> 00:36:17.893]  Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:17.893 --> 00:36:22.656]  This is going to be absolutely amazing, and I'm just blessed to be involved in it.
[00:36:22.656 --> 00:36:24.237]  Again, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:36:24.237 --> 00:36:27.099]  InfoWars.com.
[00:36:27.099 --> 00:36:36.504]  Okay, now remember what we did with the Obama InfoWars.com socialist posters.
[00:36:36.504 --> 00:36:37.485]  Obama as the Joker.
[00:36:39.298 --> 00:36:48.745]  I knew that if millions of listeners of this radio show, and I'm really risking my life doing this, and people want me to get more offensive, more in the globalist face, the power is you, the people.
[00:36:48.745 --> 00:36:50.706]  So I'm just trying to show you your power.
[00:36:50.706 --> 00:36:52.547]  That's what Gandhi tried to do.
[00:36:52.547 --> 00:36:54.348]  That's what Martin Luther King tried to do.
[00:36:54.348 --> 00:36:56.250]  And that's what gets you killed.
[00:36:56.250 --> 00:37:02.114]  I'll tell you right now, I'm walking around in expressway traffic doing this.
[00:37:02.114 --> 00:37:03.094]  And I don't enjoy it.
[00:37:03.094 --> 00:37:05.176]  But I do enjoy seeing the victories against tyranny.
[00:37:07.861 --> 00:37:10.683]  Because the establishment knows how much power you've got.
[00:37:10.683 --> 00:37:25.692]  From Berlin, Germany, to Tokyo, Japan, from Beijing, China, to London, England, to Los Angeles, to San Francisco, to Buenos Aires, German TV, Ecuadorian TV, I mean it just goes on and on.
[00:37:25.692 --> 00:37:31.956]  Have you done a startpage.com or Google search?
[00:37:31.956 --> 00:37:35.058]  Have you gone out to a search engine and searched Obama?
[00:37:36.377 --> 00:37:41.799]  Poster in the news and then German news or Russian news or Japanese news.
[00:37:41.799 --> 00:37:43.320]  I mean, I can't even watch them all.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.521]  There's... I don't know.
[00:37:45.521 --> 00:37:46.482]  I can't put a number on it.
[00:37:46.482 --> 00:37:49.183]  I probably watched 300, 400.
[00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:50.864]  I mean, I know it's more than 300.
[00:37:50.864 --> 00:37:52.184]  Hundreds!
[00:37:52.184 --> 00:37:55.005]  Some days I'd see 50, 60 and waste an hour watching.
[00:37:55.005 --> 00:37:56.486]  I don't have the time.
[00:37:56.486 --> 00:38:00.488]  By the way, I've got to announce the winners of the poster contest.
[00:38:02.725 --> 00:38:03.525]  But here's the issue.
[00:38:03.525 --> 00:38:08.368]  I've been so busy launching this operation that I haven't watched all the videos that came in.
[00:38:08.368 --> 00:38:12.190]  Dozens and dozens and dozens of those on the new poster contest.
[00:38:12.190 --> 00:38:15.712]  We had a new poster contest where you can make whatever political poster you want, shoot video of it, post it.
[00:38:16.749 --> 00:38:23.795]  And I've got some more of those to watch tonight, so sometime over the weekend I'll announce the winners in the story and then Monday go through it in detail.
[00:38:23.795 --> 00:38:28.158]  I just bite off more than I can chew and I know folks understand, so I apologize.
[00:38:28.158 --> 00:38:38.126]  I could easily walk in there and just pick three good ones, but I want to go ahead and see all of them that came in as of Tuesday when the contest closed.
[00:38:38.126 --> 00:38:40.748]  So I'll be announcing that on Monday.
[00:38:40.748 --> 00:38:42.809]  Just because I'm not going to shortchange anybody.
[00:38:42.809 --> 00:38:44.491]  I'm going to watch them all.
[00:38:44.491 --> 00:38:45.652]  And I've run out of time.
[00:38:46.653 --> 00:38:47.954]  And I went to bed at two last night.
[00:38:47.954 --> 00:38:48.814]  I'm not complaining.
[00:38:48.814 --> 00:38:49.735]  I'm just doing everything I can.
[00:38:49.735 --> 00:39:02.142]  By the way, we got huge announcements coming up when Charlie's on with us, but look, the issue here is that was an example of showing you the power you have.
[00:39:02.142 --> 00:39:07.165]  And then the second contest is about saying, look, it doesn't have to be our Obama joker poster.
[00:39:07.165 --> 00:39:08.426]  It could be about vaccines.
[00:39:08.426 --> 00:39:09.326]  It could be anti-war.
[00:39:09.326 --> 00:39:10.387]  It could be anti-drug war.
[00:39:10.387 --> 00:39:11.547]  It could be anti-police state.
[00:39:11.547 --> 00:39:14.049]  It could be pro-Second Amendment.
[00:39:15.202 --> 00:39:25.104]  It could be whatever political message you want, whatever we think is the best produced poster that is publicly posted, videotaped, and then put on the web and sent to us.
[00:39:25.104 --> 00:39:26.444]  It's not enough to just make the poster.
[00:39:26.444 --> 00:39:35.126]  It's about going out in the street and then putting it on areas that your city ordinances allow you to.
[00:39:35.126 --> 00:39:36.646]  Now, no exaggeration.
[00:39:36.646 --> 00:39:41.367]  Hundreds of local newscasts, scores of national newscasts,
[00:39:43.126 --> 00:39:47.471]  Tens of millions reached on TV and Internet.
[00:39:47.471 --> 00:39:51.835]  Millions reached in places like Miami and San Francisco.
[00:39:51.835 --> 00:39:54.578]  Some cities had thousands of the posters put up.
[00:39:54.578 --> 00:39:56.179]  Other people saw it, copied it.
[00:39:56.179 --> 00:39:59.062]  It's still going, still getting bigger.
[00:39:59.062 --> 00:40:05.009]  That's an example of you with stuff printed up at Kinko's or off your home printer.
[00:40:05.831 --> 00:40:09.972]  You can print off a hundred copies of that for, what, ten, fifteen bucks?
[00:40:09.972 --> 00:40:11.192]  Maybe less?
[00:40:11.192 --> 00:40:30.816]  Go out, staple them up, or glue them up, or tape them up, or pen them up, and one poster at the corner of a busy four-way stop on a telephone pole, by the missing dog or missing cat poster, people will look at your political poster and you'll reach hundreds of people, even if it's just up a few hours!
[00:40:32.921 --> 00:40:33.882]  It's the idea.
[00:40:33.882 --> 00:40:46.509]  I mean, they've got legal FCC-approved AM fraction-of-a-watt transmitters that when you put it into the right little five-foot antenna on your roof, goes out upwards of three miles.
[00:40:46.509 --> 00:41:01.679]  You put one of those on your roof, totally legal, totally lawful, plug it into the computer, stream whatever you want, get an audience, in a few months, put up posters all over the listening area, you'll have hundreds and hundreds of people listening within days.
[00:41:05.550 --> 00:41:11.912]  All we're about is solutions, and that's why COINTELPRO attacks us, why the media attacks us, and lies about us and misrepresents us.
[00:41:11.912 --> 00:41:18.555]  Because we are kicking absolute New World Order butt.
[00:41:18.555 --> 00:41:23.456]  We are kicking New World Order butt by showing the people the power they have.
[00:41:23.456 --> 00:41:27.658]  Now, with this Charlie Sheen idea, when I say we can take the country and the world back,
[00:41:28.874 --> 00:41:32.276]  Instead of letting the establishment try to rewrite history, because we took history back.
[00:41:32.276 --> 00:41:35.777]  The majority of people in every major poll believe 9-11's an inside job now.
[00:41:35.777 --> 00:41:38.859]  Or at the bare minimum, the government covered it up.
[00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:47.003]  84% in a New York Times poll three years ago.
[00:41:47.003 --> 00:41:58.008]  And when we get out and get involved and take action, and when we come out with a stunt like this, and get it front and center in front of the media, doling out
[00:41:59.164 --> 00:42:07.238]  The audio interviews, and the live interviews, and the letter, and the video release, and the message of the President, and then live today with big announcements and challenges.
[00:42:07.238 --> 00:42:08.721]  Oh yes.
[00:42:08.721 --> 00:42:11.626]  When we do that, it creates a perfect storm.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.741]  And does it mean we'll succeed and totally bring down the globalists?
[00:42:19.741 --> 00:42:21.161]  This time, no.
[00:42:21.161 --> 00:42:24.222]  It is the resistance that is the victory.
[00:42:24.222 --> 00:42:28.123]  And it's resisting with the truth and standing up to the lie that is the victory.
[00:42:28.123 --> 00:42:36.285]  It is the spiritual, psychological act of setting your mind in motion and setting your body in motion against the new world order.
[00:42:36.285 --> 00:42:39.846]  Setting your will against them.
[00:42:39.846 --> 00:42:44.507]  Committing.
[00:42:44.507 --> 00:42:45.367]  And so when Hannity
[00:42:46.337 --> 00:42:53.363]  And Limbaugh and Bill O'Reilly attack.
[00:42:53.363 --> 00:43:09.898]  When they attack, when they come out and attack, the majority of their viewers know they're twisting and lying and they can see it in the tone and see it in their face and it reignites and makes people think about the inside job and then they already know it's true in their heart.
[00:43:09.898 --> 00:43:11.500]  They know it's true in their intellect and we win.
[00:43:12.827 --> 00:43:14.409]  The National Geographic hit piece.
[00:43:14.409 --> 00:43:15.149]  We win.
[00:43:15.149 --> 00:43:27.161]  Oh, they'll get some of the brain-dead, soulless drones, but humanity that's still awake and alive and still has a soul and a connection to truth recognizes truth.
[00:43:27.161 --> 00:43:31.905]  And they resonate with the courage of Charlie Sheen with, you know, all of his baggage.
[00:43:31.905 --> 00:43:32.386]  Big deal.
[00:43:32.386 --> 00:43:33.267]  Everybody's got baggage.
[00:43:35.114 --> 00:43:40.356]  He's got a lot of good baggage of being a person of a lot of courage.
[00:43:40.356 --> 00:43:48.059]  By putting himself out there, he's the perfect bait for them to grab it, and then it blows up in their face every time, and we knew it would.
[00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:55.162]  So pray for us, though, because there's always a price to pay.
[00:43:55.162 --> 00:44:02.345]  The old African proverb, what is it, a Zulu proverb?
[00:44:02.345 --> 00:44:03.966]  No good deed goes unpunished.
[00:44:05.854 --> 00:44:11.337]  It's true, but no good deed goes unrewarded as well.
[00:44:11.337 --> 00:44:32.186]  Because I've learned in my life, the curses, the bad things enemies do to you, it always has a price up front, but if you take it cheerfully and say, thank you God, that my enemies are attacking me, like Job, in the end you get it all back many times over.
[00:44:32.186 --> 00:44:35.468]  When you tune into your heart, tune into love, tune into your center,
[00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:47.373]  And the only time I ask God for anything is, all my prayers are, God, just use me as a vessel.
[00:44:47.373 --> 00:44:48.273]  I know I'm not perfect.
[00:44:48.273 --> 00:44:50.293]  Help me make the right decisions.
[00:44:50.293 --> 00:44:51.874]  Lead God and direct me.
[00:44:51.874 --> 00:44:56.875]  But please, I don't want to die, but please have them kill me first.
[00:44:56.875 --> 00:44:59.796]  Just don't let them hurt my family.
[00:44:59.796 --> 00:45:07.538]  That's the one thing, and I feel bad even asking God for something, but I just say, please let the New World Order torture me, rip me in pieces, just protect my little ones.
[00:45:07.538 --> 00:45:08.938]  And I trust that God's gonna do that.
[00:45:09.943 --> 00:45:27.627]  In fact, I know in my heart, and it's just such an incredibly fulfilling feeling to know that the creator of the universe has got his eye on my family.
[00:45:27.627 --> 00:45:35.629]  Because God loves the sparrow sitting in the little tree, loves it like you can't even imagine.
[00:45:35.629 --> 00:45:37.009]  How much more does God love you?
[00:45:39.918 --> 00:45:43.779]  As a society, as a species, we are children.
[00:45:43.779 --> 00:45:45.119]  This is all a growing process.
[00:45:45.119 --> 00:45:49.721]  It's all a test.
[00:45:49.721 --> 00:45:55.662]  And I'm just glad that in my life that I didn't fall to the dark side.
[00:45:55.662 --> 00:46:06.785]  I almost did, but I think that was part of God's plan so that I could see what evil is and then be taken back at the edge and then taken up on the mountain.
[00:46:08.646 --> 00:46:13.307]  Let's go ahead and go to Ted Anderson.
[00:46:13.307 --> 00:46:19.970]  Ted, I wanted to get you on because I remember you two weeks ago offering gold at $911 to $914 an ounce when it was at $960.
[00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:20.790]  And now it's up at what, $1,013 today.
[00:46:28.619 --> 00:46:38.247]  And you've still got some gold left at the much lower price, but this is the absolute end, as the Jim Morrison song goes.
[00:46:38.247 --> 00:46:41.710]  This is the end, my friend, of our elaborate plans.
[00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:42.611]  The end.
[00:46:42.611 --> 00:46:46.554]  I'll never look into your eyes again, my friend.
[00:46:46.554 --> 00:46:47.115]  It's the end.
[00:46:47.115 --> 00:46:50.918]  Ted Anderson, incredible explosion in gold.
[00:46:51.340 --> 00:46:51.780]  Yeah, it is.
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:47:02.547]  It's a real hot market right now, and like you said, we're working at that $9.45 level now, and with gold at $1,013, that looks awfully, like an awfully good buy.
[00:47:02.547 --> 00:47:12.314]  My guess, being in the market as long as I have been, I'll be looking to buy in bargain levels when it reaches back down to this price within about the next three, four weeks.
[00:47:13.387 --> 00:47:26.012]  I don't expect to see gold hold at this 1013 level just due to the fact that the resistance level at 945 was held real strong and then it started bouncing into the thousands.
[00:47:26.012 --> 00:47:29.873]  I'm guessing we'll be sitting here maybe between 1100 and 1200 dollars an ounce very shortly.
[00:47:32.327 --> 00:47:36.311]  And when you see $1,013, you're going to go, wow, that's a good price.
[00:47:36.311 --> 00:47:39.154]  I better grab a hold of it now while I can.
[00:47:39.154 --> 00:47:41.176]  At least that's the way I look at it.
[00:47:41.176 --> 00:47:48.543]  And so I just want to say, right now, the stuff that I'm working at $945 is going to look, as far as I'm concerned, that much better.
[00:47:48.543 --> 00:47:50.165]  Are you kidding, Ted?
[00:47:50.165 --> 00:47:52.087]  Are you saying you still have gold at $945 when it's $1,013?
[00:47:54.409 --> 00:47:55.790]  Yeah, I'm still holding the prices.
[00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:57.732]  Remember we were talking about the francs at $2.33?
[00:47:57.732 --> 00:48:06.038]  Okay, I thought you were going to go up, because I happen to know you bought your last buy at about $9.86, you were telling me yesterday.
[00:48:06.038 --> 00:48:10.101]  So you've got a little bit left at the $9.40 something range.
[00:48:10.101 --> 00:48:11.702]  I mean, that is insane, Ted.
[00:48:11.702 --> 00:48:17.667]  Well, it is, but what I'm doing here is I'm just trying to hang in there throughout the weekend with what I have.
[00:48:18.447 --> 00:48:22.649]  I know full well that I'm restricted to what I can do.
[00:48:22.649 --> 00:48:36.135]  Silver now has seen a high of $17.02, so I won't be able to do a whole lot there anymore, but I still have, we talked about the $10 Liberties, we talked about the Sovereigns and Franks.
[00:48:36.135 --> 00:48:42.057]  With silver at $17 an ounce, I had to have my head examined, but I still have the Walking Liberty halves at $8.69, and that's
[00:48:44.258 --> 00:48:44.478]  Yeah.
[00:48:59.688 --> 00:49:13.077]  Right now, at this point in time, if you have any sense to it at all, if you've been thinking about it, you know, did you realize that 31, I think it was 31, no, it was 35 to 1, the insider traders right now are selling the U.S.
[00:49:13.077 --> 00:49:15.238]  stock market and getting away from it.
[00:49:15.238 --> 00:49:18.700]  I mean, it's just that... Well, that's exactly what Bob Shannon is coming up, said.
[00:49:20.393 --> 00:49:24.776]  Like eight months ago, he said, when it was at its bottom, he said, they're going to run it back up and then plunge it again.
[00:49:24.776 --> 00:49:27.639]  And it's a sucker's rally.
[00:49:27.639 --> 00:49:31.822]  They just do this over and over and over again, but the trend is downward.
[00:49:31.822 --> 00:49:34.624]  They jack it up, drop it down, but overall it goes down.
[00:49:34.624 --> 00:49:40.348]  And I warned everybody, I said, folks, while the market's up in the last few months, I said, get the hell out.
[00:49:40.348 --> 00:49:41.930]  But they just, people won't listen.
[00:49:41.930 --> 00:49:43.371]  They love to be suckered, Ted.
[00:49:43.951 --> 00:49:51.113]  They do, and you know, I honestly, I get a little bit feverish when I see the price of gold rising, and I think that's the reason why I need to buy it.
[00:49:51.113 --> 00:49:56.114]  But when you look at what's going on in the market in its entirety, right now you're a fool.
[00:49:56.114 --> 00:50:00.195]  You're a fool to stay in paper currency, and you're a fool to be in the stock market.
[00:50:00.195 --> 00:50:01.556]  Chad, I had a little bit of money.
[00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:04.559]  I've been so busy, I haven't bought any gold or silver.
[00:50:04.559 --> 00:50:07.403]  You know, every six months or so, I buy a little few coins here and there.
[00:50:07.403 --> 00:50:09.145]  And now I feel like an idiot myself.
[00:50:09.145 --> 00:50:11.227]  I understand why some people don't move.
[00:50:11.227 --> 00:50:14.091]  Then they move when it goes up, because I'm about to move when it's up.
[00:50:14.091 --> 00:50:15.513]  By the way, keep me some of that.
[00:50:15.513 --> 00:50:17.495]  Just a few coins, please.
[00:50:17.495 --> 00:50:18.837]  I've been forgetting to call you.
[00:50:18.837 --> 00:50:19.478]  I've been too busy.
[00:50:20.319 --> 00:50:22.040]  I mean, I'm in the same boat, Ted.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:26.184]  Well, you know, I mean, if you have Charlie Sheen coming up, you better be focused on that, but yeah.
[00:50:26.184 --> 00:50:30.448]  Look, I got the paint peeling off my garage and the neighbors are getting mad in the neighborhood.
[00:50:30.448 --> 00:50:33.451]  I'm too busy to call people to paint it or go out and paint it myself.
[00:50:33.451 --> 00:50:35.593]  I've got to get the gold and the silver.
[00:50:35.593 --> 00:50:36.574]  800-686-2237.
[00:50:36.574 --> 00:50:38.896]  The brokers are standing by.
[00:50:38.896 --> 00:50:42.339]  This is gold Ted bought into the market when gold was
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:46.282]  $60, $70 less than it is now.
[00:50:46.282 --> 00:50:47.842]  He's passing those savings on to you.
[00:50:47.842 --> 00:50:51.624]  You are out of your minds if you don't call and get the gold and silver coins.
[00:50:51.624 --> 00:50:52.585]  He's got 800-686-2237.
[00:50:52.585 --> 00:50:55.366]  Ted, stay there.
[00:50:55.366 --> 00:50:57.107]  I've got a few more questions for you on the other side.
[00:50:57.107 --> 00:50:58.508]  Then Bob Chapman coming up.
[00:50:58.508 --> 00:51:00.489]  Then we'll cover 9-11 Truth and Charlie Sheen.
[00:51:01.377 --> 00:51:10.606]  If you or your parents are 62 years of age or older and a homeowner, RMApply.com has a message that is vitally important for you and your family.

[00:51:38.046 --> 00:51:38.466]  I think so.
[00:52:00.905 --> 00:52:07.669]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[00:52:07.669 --> 00:52:10.310]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[00:52:10.310 --> 00:52:11.851]  But who is the enemy?
[00:52:11.851 --> 00:52:12.652]  Bin Laden.
[00:52:12.652 --> 00:52:13.632]  This is his ammo.
[00:52:13.632 --> 00:52:15.013]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[00:52:15.013 --> 00:52:17.014]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[00:52:17.014 --> 00:52:24.158]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[00:52:24.158 --> 00:52:24.639]  Some U.S.
[00:52:24.639 --> 00:52:30.282]  investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[00:52:30.982 --> 00:52:34.484]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:36.646]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[00:53:00.976 --> 00:53:02.537]  Are you constantly tired?
[00:53:02.537 --> 00:53:04.397]  Have a hard time concentrating?
[00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:07.679]  Experience muscle weakness or have problems with digestion?
[00:53:07.679 --> 00:53:10.700]  The solution may be as simple as detoxifying your body.

[00:54:11.509 --> 00:54:13.259]  I think this song says it all!
[00:54:13.259 --> 00:54:14.587]  Ha ha!
[00:54:37.239 --> 00:54:38.300]  Put it all on the line.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:41.303]  My name, my life, my treasure, my family.
[00:54:41.303 --> 00:54:45.548]  Throwing it all in for liberty and the republic.
[00:55:07.316 --> 00:55:11.777]  Yeah, all my enemies piled on and you only made our story go bigger.
[00:55:11.777 --> 00:55:13.137]  Thank you.
[00:55:13.137 --> 00:55:15.017]  That's what I wanted to happen.
[00:55:15.017 --> 00:55:16.178]  You don't think I didn't know?
[00:55:16.178 --> 00:55:22.559]  You don't have a lot of discernment, do you?
[00:55:22.559 --> 00:55:26.099]  That's because you're on the dark side.
[00:55:26.099 --> 00:55:34.001]  The true power lies in goodness and in love.
[00:55:34.001 --> 00:55:36.341]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[00:55:42.253 --> 00:55:44.475]  Thank you, God.
[00:55:44.475 --> 00:55:45.275]  That's right.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:23.886]  We are in the arena, showing the people the power of humanity.
[00:56:23.886 --> 00:56:28.969]  Ted Anderson, we've got Bob Chapman coming up, Charlie Sheen live today with a big challenge.
[00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:30.810]  People do not want to miss this.
[00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:34.953]  I will assure everyone, call everybody you know, tell them to tune in at T-minus, one hour thirty minutes.
[00:56:34.953 --> 00:56:38.055]  I want to get precise, one hour thirty-four minutes.
[00:56:38.055 --> 00:56:38.736]  Ted Anderson!
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:45.163]  In closing, this has got to be one of the best deals or the best deal you've ever offered.
[00:56:45.163 --> 00:56:47.625]  I know you haven't offered a deal this good in over a year.
[00:56:47.625 --> 00:56:51.627]  Gold at the $9.45 that you bought in the market with your tiny markup.
[00:56:51.627 --> 00:56:52.948]  I've seen the sheets, $4 on a $240 coin.
[00:56:52.948 --> 00:56:53.768]  I don't even know how you do it.
[00:56:57.651 --> 00:56:59.895]  But now, forget that.
[00:56:59.895 --> 00:57:04.601]  So in the market, you're going to sell those coins then below what it is right now for spot.
[00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:12.172]  If gold is $1,013 and you bought into the market at $944, this is way below spot on silver and gold, isn't it?
[00:57:12.332 --> 00:57:13.553]  Well, let's just put it this way.
[00:57:13.553 --> 00:57:19.898]  If I try to buy those same coins in the market today, we'll have to pay a lot more money and I'm going to have to charge you a lot more money.
[00:57:19.898 --> 00:57:21.360]  That's the bottom line truth.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:22.621]  And you're talking about that song.
[00:57:22.621 --> 00:57:24.843]  I think that's from the 1960s.
[00:57:24.843 --> 00:57:26.824]  And he's singing about silver dollars.
[00:57:27.925 --> 00:57:38.877]  Okay, well if it's from the 70s it may be... 1971 is when we lost the gold standard here in the United States of America and we went to a complete fiat currency.
[00:57:38.877 --> 00:57:41.439]  He's talking about something that's real and valuable.
[00:57:41.439 --> 00:57:44.823]  He's not talking about... He's not singing about a paper Federal Reserve note.
[00:57:45.717 --> 00:57:54.341]  You know, and we think that we can live on this legacy of a strong currency, world currency, without it being backed.
[00:57:54.341 --> 00:58:00.084]  It's just like when King James III, or whatever his name, when he was trying to sell wooden, you know, coins.
[00:58:00.084 --> 00:58:00.885]  King George, yeah.
[00:58:00.885 --> 00:58:03.846]  King George, instead of gold coins.
[00:58:03.846 --> 00:58:09.349]  I mean, why would people accept paper currency in exchange for gold and silver?
[00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:12.110]  It's just nuts, but at this time you can still do it.
[00:58:12.110 --> 00:58:13.351]  How long can you offer this?
[00:58:14.389 --> 00:58:15.149]  Record deal.
[00:58:15.149 --> 00:58:16.990]  I'm holding this till the weekend's over.
[00:58:16.990 --> 00:58:22.292]  I wish I could predict what gold is going to do next week, but I can tell you right now, this is a fabulous buy.
[00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:25.233]  I really recommend that people get in right now.
[00:58:25.233 --> 00:58:26.553]  And what are the coins?
[00:58:26.553 --> 00:58:32.135]  The coins are going to be the British Sovereign, the Frank, the best buy of all, the Walking Liberty Half.
[00:58:32.135 --> 00:58:35.016]  I have some $10 Liberties that I'm still holding the price down.
[00:58:35.016 --> 00:58:35.076]  800-686-2237.
[00:58:35.076 --> 00:58:35.576]  The number, 800-686-2237.

[00:58:50.305 --> 00:58:55.607]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:58:55.607 --> 00:59:00.128]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:59:00.128 --> 00:59:02.409]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:59:02.409 --> 00:59:04.030]  You don't have to cooperate.

[01:00:05.239 --> 01:00:06.540]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.322]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.322 --> 01:00:10.063]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:11.644]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.644 --> 01:00:12.565]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:12.565 --> 01:00:17.389]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:21.472]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:24.435 --> 01:00:28.238]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:00:28.238 --> 01:00:31.721]  Crashing through the lines and disinformation.
[01:00:31.721 --> 01:00:33.842]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:00:33.842 --> 01:00:35.023]  to 3 p.m.
[01:00:35.023 --> 01:00:37.325]  Central Standard Time.
[01:00:37.325 --> 01:00:38.326]  12 noon to 4 p.m.
[01:00:38.326 --> 01:00:39.887]  Eastern.
[01:00:39.887 --> 01:00:41.789]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:41.789 --> 01:00:44.511]  We're gonna have financial experts popping in today.
[01:00:44.511 --> 01:00:47.974]  9-11 Truth activists popping in from We Are Change LA.
[01:00:47.974 --> 01:00:49.535]  Get some reports from New York as well.
[01:00:50.834 --> 01:01:00.418]  In one and a half hours, one hour, 30 minutes from now, Charlie Sheen, world exclusive, extended, long interview, big challenge he's going to put out.
[01:01:00.418 --> 01:01:03.099]  Believe me, this is going to be some powerful breaking news.
[01:01:03.099 --> 01:01:05.560]  He'll tell you about his discussions with the White House.
[01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.161]  He'll tell you about his discussions with CNN.
[01:01:08.161 --> 01:01:12.182]  Tell you about a lot of things happening behind the scenes.
[01:01:12.182 --> 01:01:13.543]  Coming up in an hour and a half.
[01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:19.033]  I'm gonna open the phones up right now on any issue you wish to discuss.
[01:01:19.033 --> 01:01:19.113]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:19.113 --> 01:01:19.173]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:01:29.724 --> 01:01:33.005]  We will get you up and on the air.
[01:01:33.005 --> 01:01:37.626]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:01:37.626 --> 01:01:42.947]  We will start simulcasting the radio show at PrisonPlanet.tv in the visual format.
[01:01:42.947 --> 01:01:52.629]  We simulcast it as an online TV show in T-minus 58 minutes when we start the third and fourth hours today when Mr. Charlie Sheen is with us.
[01:01:54.577 --> 01:02:10.432]  So it is all coming up today, ladies and gentlemen, on this September 11, 2009, eight years after the tragic events of 9-11.
[01:02:10.432 --> 01:02:11.633]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:02:11.633 --> 01:02:16.998]  What do you think about the White House blaming media for false reports for scare resulting from Coast Guard exercise?
[01:02:18.348 --> 01:02:28.854]  Yeah, see, they have the media standing by, CNN, to hype it and make a big deal out of it as a PSYOP and then blame it on the media who carried it out for the White House.
[01:02:28.854 --> 01:02:44.242]  Just like it came out that the White House tried to blame the media first for Air Force One flying in between buildings a couple hundred yards away a few months ago as a PSYOP, earlier this year, and then it came out they told the city.
[01:02:45.373 --> 01:02:49.355]  The police department, don't tell the fire department, don't tell the other city agencies.
[01:02:49.355 --> 01:02:52.257]  The feds said don't tell anybody.
[01:02:52.257 --> 01:02:55.338]  So the city freaked out and flipped out and said they didn't know what was happening.
[01:02:55.338 --> 01:03:02.382]  To test the PSYOP, to reignite the mental memories of 9-11, to re-invoke them.
[01:03:03.396 --> 01:03:06.077]  And I have no doubt that's what's happened with this thing in the Potomac.
[01:03:06.077 --> 01:03:11.459]  White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs today said he was not aware of any heads up given by the U.S.
[01:03:11.459 --> 01:03:23.044]  Coast Guard to the White House about the training exercise in the Potomac River this morning as President Obama was at the Pentagon commemorating the 9-11 attacks and he suggested that any panic that resulted from the reporting to the event was the fault of the media, not law enforcement.
[01:03:23.584 --> 01:03:27.465]  Media that just so happened to be aiming their cameras at it and reporting shots fired.
[01:03:27.465 --> 01:03:29.946]  Gibbs said the report was based on listening to a police scanner.
[01:03:29.946 --> 01:03:32.246]  It wasn't verified before being reported.
[01:03:32.246 --> 01:03:34.847]  Oh yes, because they were talking about a terror attack on the scanner.
[01:03:34.847 --> 01:03:37.148]  A drill.
[01:03:37.148 --> 01:03:40.509]  Many media outlets falsely reported that shots had been fired.
[01:03:40.509 --> 01:03:51.572]  If anyone was unnecessarily alarmed because of the erroneous reporting that detonated shots had been fired, I think everybody is apologetic of that, Gibbs said.
[01:03:53.541 --> 01:04:02.286]  The White House spokesman said Commander-in-Chief would not micromanage the Coast Guard's decision, pulled the exercise, and he chastised the press in honor of those who died on 9-11.
[01:04:02.286 --> 01:04:03.187]  See?
[01:04:03.187 --> 01:04:10.431]  And the future victims of terrorism, telling reporters to tell themselves, we may not get this first, but we may be the first ones to get it right.
[01:04:10.431 --> 01:04:12.892]  So see, oh, he was the fatherly figure.
[01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:17.675]  Calming everyone the terrorists haven't struck, as I stand here as your war chief, your warbird.
[01:04:19.329 --> 01:04:26.394]  Just like Bush when he was at Glen Eagles over in Scotland for the G8 and then boom, the terrorist strike, he gets to grandstand.
[01:04:26.394 --> 01:04:32.638]  We ought to be thankful that the National Security Council's only staging Gulf of Tonkin events.
[01:04:32.638 --> 01:04:35.580]  Remember, nothing attacked those ships, they just said they were.
[01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:36.861]  Same thing here.
[01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:39.403]  They love it!
[01:04:39.403 --> 01:04:40.864]  Remember, Cheney wanted to attack U.S.
[01:04:40.864 --> 01:04:41.545]  ships, to blame it.
[01:04:42.495 --> 01:04:43.376]  on Iran.
[01:04:43.376 --> 01:04:45.118]  They just love it!
[01:04:45.118 --> 01:04:46.759]  And they love using drills to fear murder.
[01:04:46.759 --> 01:04:48.261]  That's why they run anti-terror drills.
[01:04:48.261 --> 01:04:52.665]  One of the reasons is to blow up buses, blow up things in your town, and then later announce it was a drill.
[01:04:52.665 --> 01:04:57.070]  It's part of creating that psychological perception that there really are terror attacks going on.
[01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:58.351]  It's basic psychology.
[01:04:58.351 --> 01:04:58.852]  Stay with us!
[01:05:00.643 --> 01:05:05.606]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:05:30.643 --> 01:05:30.963]  I think?
[01:06:00.967 --> 01:06:03.970]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:06:03.970 --> 01:06:09.315]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:06:09.315 --> 01:06:11.357]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:06:11.357 --> 01:06:16.362]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:06:16.362 --> 01:06:17.283]  How much do you want?
[01:06:17.523 --> 01:06:18.644]  When do you want it?
[01:06:18.644 --> 01:06:20.525]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:06:20.525 --> 01:06:21.606]  When will you need it?
[01:06:21.606 --> 01:06:23.807]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:06:23.807 --> 01:06:25.148]  Will there be any food?
[01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.689]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:06:26.689 --> 01:06:31.953]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:06:31.953 --> 01:06:35.535]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:06:35.535 --> 01:06:38.998]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:06:39.338 --> 01:06:40.578]  How much will you need?
[01:06:40.578 --> 01:06:41.479]  We don't know.
[01:06:41.479 --> 01:06:42.579]  How much do you want?
[01:06:42.579 --> 01:06:43.519]  All you can get.
[01:06:43.519 --> 01:06:44.599]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:47.660]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:49.441]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:06:49.441 --> 01:06:50.341]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:07:00.478 --> 01:07:01.379]  Today.
[01:07:01.379 --> 01:07:03.081]  Alex Jones here with a question.
[01:07:03.081 --> 01:07:04.823]  What does humidity mean to you?
[01:07:04.823 --> 01:07:12.632]  Most people think of hot and sticky summer days, but many people are beginning to realize that humidity can be a valuable source of pure drinking water.
[01:07:12.632 --> 01:07:15.836]  That's why I'd like you to visit a coloblue.com.
[01:07:15.836 --> 01:07:19.340]  A coloblue is a state of the art atmospheric water generator.
[01:07:19.733 --> 01:07:32.284]  Producing purified drinking water from the humidity in the air using reverse osmosis and a five-stage carbon and UV light filtration system which produces great tasting water at an unbeatable price.
[01:07:32.284 --> 01:07:34.305]  Finally, drinking water that you control.
[01:07:34.305 --> 01:07:36.007]  I use one every day.
[01:07:36.007 --> 01:07:38.469]  Say goodbye to expensive water delivery services.
[01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:41.691]  And storing five gallon bottles of water in your home.
[01:07:41.691 --> 01:07:44.272]  The Ecolablue 28 is shipped right to your home.
[01:07:44.272 --> 01:07:46.674]  Ready to make close to seven gallons a day.
[01:07:46.674 --> 01:07:47.674]  Right out of the box.
[01:07:47.674 --> 01:07:49.635]  They have a 30-day money-back guarantee.
[01:07:49.635 --> 01:07:51.176]  Call Ecolablue right now at 1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:51.176 --> 01:07:51.537]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[01:07:51.537 --> 01:07:53.037]  Or visit Ecolablue at E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.
[01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:15.032]  I have faith in humanity that if we will stand up and be leaders in our communities against this tyranny, we can have victory.
[01:08:31.909 --> 01:08:40.673]  Tom Stewart, Joppa, Lauren, Tommy and others, your calls are coming up at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:40.673 --> 01:08:47.096]  It is September 11th, 2009, eight years after the tragic stage terror attacks.
[01:08:47.096 --> 01:08:48.757]  Charlie Sheen is coming up live.
[01:08:50.563 --> 01:08:56.906]  In the middle of the next hour, I am asking all our listeners to go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[01:08:56.906 --> 01:08:58.107]  Top of the page, a banner.
[01:08:58.107 --> 01:08:59.828]  20 minutes with the President.
[01:08:59.828 --> 01:09:00.828]  Click on it.
[01:09:00.828 --> 01:09:10.673]  And there at the top of that page, above his letter to the President, is the video, Charlie Sheen's message to the President.
[01:09:10.673 --> 01:09:14.155]  Requesting a new 9-11 investigation is chock full of key video clips.
[01:09:15.353 --> 01:09:21.680]  The White House being caught lying about prior knowledge, the buildings being blown up, and Charlie Sheen's message.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:25.764]  There are thousands of copies of it on the web.
[01:09:25.764 --> 01:09:29.928]  The first video we uploaded has over 100,000 views.
[01:09:29.928 --> 01:09:33.792]  I would guess it'll have over 300,000 views by tomorrow.
[01:09:33.792 --> 01:09:37.496]  But if you will get it and send it out to your entire email list, post it everywhere,
[01:09:40.802 --> 01:09:44.304]  We could get a million views on it, on that one original video.
[01:09:44.304 --> 01:09:46.606]  I have no doubt it's already been seen over a million times.
[01:09:46.606 --> 01:09:49.548]  TV stations are playing it.
[01:09:49.548 --> 01:09:53.570]  The Sun grabbed our video, posted it in their own format in their player.
[01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:54.371]  It's just everywhere.
[01:09:54.371 --> 01:09:55.892]  I can't even track it.
[01:09:55.892 --> 01:10:01.916]  I would conservatively say one million people, less than 24 hours after the launch, have seen it.
[01:10:01.916 --> 01:10:04.097]  So again, get the video, get it out to everybody.
[01:10:04.097 --> 01:10:06.759]  I think it's one of the best videos we've ever produced.
[01:10:06.759 --> 01:10:08.400]  Great job Aaron Dykes and Charlie Sheen.
[01:10:09.758 --> 01:10:11.039]  So please take action on that.
[01:10:11.039 --> 01:10:13.661]  I want to go to your calls, but I want to first play a clip.
[01:10:13.661 --> 01:10:14.682]  This is from Politico.
[01:10:14.682 --> 01:10:23.370]  And the headline on Politico talks about CNN taking heat for the Coast Guard story.
[01:10:23.370 --> 01:10:29.916]  Just like CNN took heat for scaring everybody with the Air Force One flying through New York.
[01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:37.792]  And then it turned out the White House ran the whole thing as a shy-op later and told the police not to tell the city what it was weeks before.
[01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:39.073]  They planned this thing.
[01:10:39.073 --> 01:10:42.814]  This is all planned to re-invoke fears on 9-11.
[01:10:42.814 --> 01:10:43.875]  This is outrageous!
[01:10:45.725 --> 01:10:46.505]  Here it is.
[01:10:46.505 --> 01:10:55.187]  Department of Homeland Security is now confirming that this was an exercise that no shots of any variety, live or blank, were fired.
[01:10:55.187 --> 01:10:57.128]  We saw things happening on the water.
[01:10:57.128 --> 01:11:01.169]  We could see boats racing around and we were listening to Coast Guard radio traffic.
[01:11:01.169 --> 01:11:04.449]  They said on the radio 10 rounds had been expended.
[01:11:04.449 --> 01:11:11.051]  To have this happen on 9-11 while commemoration ceremonies happening at the Pentagon right next door, really quite amazing.
[01:11:11.711 --> 01:11:13.952]  See, she invokes it herself.
[01:11:13.952 --> 01:11:15.752]  She's being, it's on her telescreen.
[01:11:15.752 --> 01:11:17.473]  It's on her teleprompter.
[01:11:17.473 --> 01:11:28.516]  There, as she speaks into the telescreen to the American people, people of the world, in case people weren't connecting it to 9-11, as he speaks about 9-11, just a mile away, we thought terrorists had hit.
[01:11:28.516 --> 01:11:30.497]  Oh my goody, gumdrops.
[01:11:30.497 --> 01:11:32.737]  It's just terrible that this is happening.
[01:11:32.737 --> 01:11:34.658]  This is just so horrible.
[01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:37.299]  Oh, we're so sorry, but they did say it over the radio.
[01:11:37.299 --> 01:11:37.979]  Oh my goodness.
[01:11:39.585 --> 01:11:46.331]  Remember Air Force One photo op triggers panic in Manhattan and then it came out weeks later, they staged it all exactly as we told you?
[01:11:46.331 --> 01:11:52.937]  If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it is a duck.
[01:11:52.937 --> 01:12:02.465]  This thing doesn't walk like an angel, it doesn't talk like an angel, it isn't a devil in disguise, it's in red pajamas.
[01:12:02.465 --> 01:12:05.888]  So finish up with a CNN clip.
[01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:06.508]  Inexpanded.
[01:12:06.508 --> 01:12:07.229]  To have this happen,
[01:12:07.651 --> 01:12:12.355]  On 9-11, a commemoration ceremony is happening at the Pentagon right next door.
[01:12:12.355 --> 01:12:13.456]  Really quite amazing.
[01:12:13.456 --> 01:12:20.101]  You can be sure that there's going to be a lot of high-level demand for answers.
[01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:23.804]  Oh yes, Obama will save us from this scary thing that happened.
[01:12:23.804 --> 01:12:26.006]  He's our daddy, like Bush was.
[01:12:26.006 --> 01:12:30.469]  He will protect us from the dark cult of evil that only feeds on human suffering.
[01:12:30.469 --> 01:12:32.931]  That's a quote from Bush at the Pentagon, two days after 9-11.
[01:12:34.949 --> 01:12:36.930]  A dark cult of evil.
[01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:41.792]  Talking about themselves.
[01:12:41.792 --> 01:12:44.072]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, we see what this is.
[01:12:44.072 --> 01:12:50.635]  It's a devil in disguise.
[01:12:50.635 --> 01:12:52.616]  You look like an angel.
[01:12:52.616 --> 01:12:54.876]  You look like an angel.
[01:12:54.876 --> 01:12:56.877]  Walk like an angel.
[01:12:56.877 --> 01:12:58.818]  Walk like an angel.
[01:12:58.818 --> 01:13:01.399]  Talk like an angel.
[01:13:01.399 --> 01:13:03.600]  But I got one.
[01:13:07.430 --> 01:13:08.391]  Oh, yes you are.
[01:13:08.391 --> 01:13:09.652]  Oh, yes you are.
[01:13:09.652 --> 01:13:14.976]  Devil in disguise.
[01:13:14.976 --> 01:13:18.759]  You fooled me with your kisses.
[01:13:18.759 --> 01:13:22.122]  You cheated and you schemed.
[01:13:22.122 --> 01:13:25.604]  Heaven knows how you lied to me.
[01:13:25.604 --> 01:13:29.728]  You're not the way you seem.
[01:13:29.728 --> 01:13:33.971]  You look like an angel.
[01:13:33.971 --> 01:13:35.652]  Walk like an angel.
[01:13:38.118 --> 01:13:47.685]  Alright, Tom in California, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:13:47.685 --> 01:13:49.807]  Hey, how you doing, sir?
[01:13:49.807 --> 01:13:50.087]  Good!
[01:13:59.654 --> 01:14:00.535]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:14:00.535 --> 01:14:02.756]  I've been listening to your show for quite a long time now.
[01:14:02.756 --> 01:14:05.859]  I just want to bring another layer to 9-11 that I think you'll be very interested in.
[01:14:05.859 --> 01:14:09.121]  I was a professional airline pilot for 12 years.
[01:14:09.121 --> 01:14:12.944]  I have over 10,000 hours of flight time, all the licenses, airline transport licenses, etc.
[01:14:12.944 --> 01:14:16.947]  I was a 747-400 captain for two years for a company called Atlas.
[01:14:16.947 --> 01:14:20.550]  Prior to that, I flew the 737 as a captain for seven years.
[01:14:20.550 --> 01:14:25.113]  I've done a lot of analysis, just opening the airplane component into the mix here for 9-11.
[01:14:25.113 --> 01:14:25.513]  Back in 2002, 2003,
[01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:32.514]  They put the remote control takeover chip in it.
[01:14:32.514 --> 01:14:32.914]  Of course.
[01:14:32.914 --> 01:14:36.017]  Well, I'll put it even further, sir.
[01:14:36.017 --> 01:14:45.044]  If you look at the amateur video of the 767-200 series aircraft that did hit, that pod that's on the pod, that's called a radome.
[01:14:45.044 --> 01:14:46.986]  That's manufactured by Martin Marietta.
[01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:50.329]  It's been manufactured here in the United States for 37 years.
[01:14:50.329 --> 01:14:54.652]  Exclusively used by the US military to fly Air Force drones.
[01:14:54.652 --> 01:14:55.493]  Clearly!
[01:14:55.493 --> 01:14:56.314]  A control pod?
[01:14:57.287 --> 01:15:04.329]  Clearly, that is used only to radio control aircraft in Hyden and Kenai.
[01:15:04.329 --> 01:15:08.010]  There are no civilian airplanes that have that pod, period.
[01:15:08.010 --> 01:15:13.292]  I challenge anybody to go out... Well, look at the E-4Bs over New York and D.C.
[01:15:13.292 --> 01:15:20.514]  as the attacks happen and then after they happen when all air traffic is shut down with the command pod on top and the American flag on back.
[01:15:20.514 --> 01:15:21.995]  Those are the doomsday planes.
[01:15:23.274 --> 01:15:24.395]  No, and I want to tell you something.
[01:15:24.395 --> 01:15:30.402]  When I looked at the amateur video, I came across that white 747-100 series, and I go, what the hell is that?
[01:15:30.402 --> 01:15:31.963]  There's no N number on this airplane.
[01:15:31.963 --> 01:15:34.286]  It's flying in an orbital pattern.
[01:15:34.286 --> 01:15:43.255]  And as we all know, that airplane was present on that day, and in a nanosecond, I said, wait a minute, that's a flying platform where they radio-controlled these airplanes.
[01:15:43.255 --> 01:15:45.918]  One more piece of information, if I may, and that is that
[01:15:46.647 --> 01:16:01.395]  If anybody even has half a brain, I know all your listeners do, thank God, but the people I talk to who are sheeple, and I say to them, look, it's right in front of your face, you say a 757-200 series hit the Pentagon, where is the debris field?
[01:16:01.395 --> 01:16:02.575]  Where are the body parts?
[01:16:02.575 --> 01:16:05.717]  Where are the two 10,000 pound CFM engines?
[01:16:05.717 --> 01:16:13.341]  Hey, on the National Geographic, they say those giant engines wouldn't even hurt the facade, wouldn't even knock a window out.
[01:16:15.748 --> 01:16:16.448]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:16:16.448 --> 01:16:21.131]  What would one of those giant engines weighing I don't know how many tons do at 550 miles an hour smashing into a concrete face?
[01:16:38.823 --> 01:16:48.831]  I can tell you, first of all, to go 550 miles an hour in an airplane, for me... To hold it down on the ground, is that impossible?
[01:16:48.831 --> 01:16:53.615]  To hold it at 60 feet and try and hit a building, that would be very, very difficult.
[01:16:53.615 --> 01:16:56.397]  You would have to be an extremely skilled pilot.
[01:16:56.397 --> 01:17:01.601]  And secondly, you're not going to be able to fly that fast because of air compression, so that's another bogus point.
[01:17:01.601 --> 01:17:05.063]  For those that don't know, there's more air down close to the ground, more water vapor.
[01:17:09.853 --> 01:17:14.901]  Well, it's just that the air pressure is denser, and it's half as dense at 14,000 feet.
[01:17:21.372 --> 01:17:24.593]  It's just to go at the speed of sound.
[01:17:24.593 --> 01:17:27.554]  And the smoking unit, there's no debris field.
[01:17:27.554 --> 01:17:28.455]  That's the bottom line.
[01:17:28.455 --> 01:17:29.835]  There's nothing there.
[01:17:29.835 --> 01:17:33.636]  And then when I tell people, I say, look, there's nothing there because the missile hit it.
[01:17:33.636 --> 01:17:35.337]  Just one more point if I may.
[01:17:35.337 --> 01:17:42.239]  I was present the day of and the day after I was based in JFK when TWA Flight 800 got shot down by a NATO missile.
[01:17:42.239 --> 01:17:43.860]  And that was the buzz.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:49.382]  I talked to an American Airlines flight crew that was landing on the 2-5 complex there and saw the frickin' thing.
[01:17:50.225 --> 01:17:57.668]  No, they've interviewed over 100 and I think it's 87 members of the military that said, yeah, we were running a drill for missile tests that night.
[01:17:57.668 --> 01:18:02.149]  Of course, there's an area called Warning Area 105, 80 miles northeast.
[01:18:02.149 --> 01:18:04.650]  You can see it on any aeronautical chart.
[01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:06.531]  This is where they were doing that.
[01:18:06.531 --> 01:18:11.053]  They were shooting that out of a Polaris submarine and it had two forms of
[01:18:11.946 --> 01:18:12.767]  I don't know.
[01:18:32.531 --> 01:18:34.932]  Uh, on bodies in that plane.
[01:18:34.932 --> 01:18:36.813]  I heard this the next day.
[01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:41.655]  And I heard two days after... No, no, they had investigators sneak in.
[01:18:41.655 --> 01:18:45.637]  They later sent them to prison and got samples and it had explosive residue.
[01:18:45.637 --> 01:18:51.440]  General Benton, Kay Parton, former head of Air Force Weapons Development said it was a continuous rod warhead missile.
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.020]  Exactly.
[01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:54.581]  There was a... You hit the nail on the head.
[01:18:54.581 --> 01:18:55.042]  I read this.
[01:18:56.161 --> 01:19:02.485]  Gosh, 10 years ago, there was a gentleman that wrote a book that worked for Aviation Space Technology, which was a 20-year reporter.
[01:19:02.485 --> 01:19:05.447]  And, simply, he said, this stinks.
[01:19:05.447 --> 01:19:09.449]  He had an insider go in and take a piece of the back of seat number 33F.
[01:19:10.951 --> 01:19:21.843]  And he took that to an independent lab, had it analyzed, and found that 99% of the exhaust gases on the back of that piece of material matched a certain Navy missile.
[01:19:21.843 --> 01:19:29.852]  And then he sent that, of course, to one of the major news agencies, and they intercepted it, and boom, he was in jail that same day.
[01:19:32.123 --> 01:19:32.824]  Absolutely.
[01:19:32.824 --> 01:19:34.144]  Continuous rod warhead.
[01:19:34.144 --> 01:19:36.586]  When they put the plane back together, you can see where it hit.
[01:19:36.586 --> 01:19:36.906]  All right.
[01:19:36.906 --> 01:19:37.826]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:19:37.826 --> 01:19:38.547]  Interesting points.
[01:19:38.547 --> 01:19:40.167]  Fits in with all the intel we have.
[01:19:40.167 --> 01:19:45.330]  You know, the first plane the evidence shows was a drone on the towers as well.
[01:19:45.330 --> 01:19:51.933]  Stewart in New York, Joppa in Texas, Lauren in Ohio, Tommy in Virginia, and everybody else, your call straight ahead at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:19:51.933 --> 01:19:53.094]  This is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:19:53.094 --> 01:19:54.075]  I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:07.468]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:20:07.468 --> 01:20:13.356]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:20:13.356 --> 01:20:19.524]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:20:19.844 --> 01:20:21.825]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:20:21.825 --> 01:20:24.287]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:20:24.287 --> 01:20:37.475]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[01:20:37.475 --> 01:20:39.136]  It's not about left or right.
[01:20:39.136 --> 01:20:40.997]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:20:40.997 --> 01:20:47.241]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:20:56.165 --> 01:20:57.747]  The Obama Deception.
[01:20:57.747 --> 01:20:58.928]  The people strike back!
[01:21:00.874 --> 01:21:01.494]  G'day!
[01:21:01.494 --> 01:21:03.215]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[01:21:03.215 --> 01:21:03.595]  August 31st, 2009.
[01:21:03.595 --> 01:21:04.676]  Gold opened this morning at $9.5470.
[01:21:04.676 --> 01:21:08.237]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $9.8195, $4.9098 for a half-ounce, or $2.4549 for a quarter-ounce.
[01:21:08.237 --> 01:21:08.697]  That's $9.8195, $4.9098, and $2.4549.
[01:21:19.882 --> 01:21:33.513]  How is it that we the people grow the cotton, weave it into fabric, engrave the ink, embed the strips and fibers that protect it from counterfeit, then cart the money off to a privately owned bank to have it lent back to us at interest, forcing us to pay taxes to service the debt?
[01:21:33.513 --> 01:21:34.754]  Is this capitalism?
[01:21:34.754 --> 01:21:42.341]  Or was Jefferson correct when he said, a central bank issuing a public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:21:42.341 --> 01:21:43.442]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:43.442 --> 01:21:47.585]  I'm placing a silver dollar inside of a book that explains how the monetary system works.
[01:21:47.785 --> 01:21:48.887]  Call for your copy 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:48.887 --> 01:21:50.731]  Isn't it time to understand the system?
[01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:50.971]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:50.971 --> 01:21:51.272]  That's 800-686-2237.
[01:22:01.638 --> 01:22:07.021]  When it comes to emergency preparedness, you know it's the responsible thing to do for you and your family.
[01:22:07.021 --> 01:22:12.144]  You also know that preparedness, though a necessity, can cost hundreds, even thousands of dollars.
[01:22:12.144 --> 01:22:17.347]  Unfortunately, in these tough economic times, most cannot get ready for emergency situations.
[01:22:17.347 --> 01:22:20.329]  For many, preparedness has been placed on the back burner.
[01:22:20.329 --> 01:22:22.430]  This year has been tough for everyone.
[01:22:22.430 --> 01:22:25.972]  But that doesn't mean you shouldn't have any less of a chance in a crisis.
[01:22:25.972 --> 01:22:29.074]  That's why Ready Reserve is offering wholesale pricing to the public.
[01:22:29.494 --> 01:22:34.958]  When you're ready, give us a call and we'll work with your budget and family size to help you grow your preparedness needs.
[01:22:39.138 --> 01:22:39.358]  I think so.
[01:23:00.735 --> 01:23:07.440]  e-cigarettesnational.com would like to introduce an alternative to smoking regular cigarettes to all GCN listeners.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.122]  It's called the e-cigarette.
[01:23:09.122 --> 01:23:13.705]  It looks, feels, tastes, and delivers nicotine like a regular cigarette.
[01:23:13.705 --> 01:23:21.371]  But because this is not a cigarette, you don't have to worry about more than 3,900 toxic chemicals and tar entering your body.
[01:23:21.371 --> 01:23:23.833]  There's no flame, so there's no risk of fire.

[01:24:15.455 --> 01:24:17.036]  Hey!
[01:24:17.036 --> 01:24:20.580]  I got something that makes me wanna shout!
[01:24:20.580 --> 01:24:23.563]  I got something that tells me what it's all about!
[01:24:23.563 --> 01:24:24.644]  That's right!
[01:24:24.644 --> 01:24:26.366]  I got soul!
[01:24:26.366 --> 01:24:28.449]  And I'm super bad!
[01:24:28.449 --> 01:24:29.350]  I got soul!
[01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:31.191]  And I'm super bad!
[01:24:39.235 --> 01:24:47.017]  Stewart New York, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:25:09.679 --> 01:25:11.260]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:25:11.260 --> 01:25:18.605]  I'm going to thank you and Charlie for the best birthday present I've had since 2001.
[01:25:18.605 --> 01:25:31.814]  My birthday is 9-11 and what you have done this past week gives me more hope than I ever had as far as bringing the real culprits to this event to some kind of justice.
[01:25:31.814 --> 01:25:34.856]  That's what we're doing, putting it back on the front burner.
[01:25:34.856 --> 01:25:38.619]  Well, it needs to be because a lot of people really still don't know
[01:25:39.187 --> 01:25:40.068]  What's going on?
[01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:53.018]  I heard the original explanation, and it had, at the time anyway, a reasonable amount of plausibility, and they left it at that, and they figured, well, the government will take care of it, and that's that.
[01:25:53.018 --> 01:26:03.586]  You listen to the radio stations around here, and we're in southeast New York, about 100 miles northwest of New York City, and you're hearing, oh, evil Osama bin Laden.
[01:26:04.455 --> 01:26:05.937]  That's one of the major topics.
[01:26:05.937 --> 01:26:12.684]  The other one is they're starting to talk about how 9-11 might be made into a national holiday.
[01:26:12.684 --> 01:26:16.488]  Yes, it's an indoctrination holiday for the children.
[01:26:16.488 --> 01:26:18.390]  Yeah, that's what I was afraid of.
[01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:19.892]  No, they've said it.
[01:26:19.892 --> 01:26:22.935]  I would certainly wouldn't mind it being a time for
[01:26:24.475 --> 01:26:51.564]  uh... deep thinking and uh... prayer but uh... let me tell you what they're turning it into they admit it's for public schools boy scouts girl scouts to literally train them under fema to be spies and the boys with m sixteen to quote take on gun owners source new york times you cannot makeup i was telling uh... charlie last night on the phone i said no i'm not kidding it's a f p n a p they really are fema is going to go in and take over
[01:26:52.597 --> 01:26:56.239]  The girl scouts and boy scouts and have them be spies to quote fight terror.
[01:26:56.239 --> 01:26:58.580]  It actually says it in the news.
[01:26:58.580 --> 01:27:00.940]  I mean, this is completely insane.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:08.584]  And the national holiday for the indoctrination to have them line up in military rows in front of telescreens with the feds giving them orders.
[01:27:08.584 --> 01:27:13.866]  And they're telling the kids quote, you know, run your household, protect your parents, report terrorists.
[01:27:14.386 --> 01:27:16.969]  You know, as if nine-year-olds are the new front line.
[01:27:16.969 --> 01:27:20.293]  I mean, this is the government trying to get a relationship with your children.
[01:27:20.293 --> 01:27:27.101]  It is absolutely Hitlerian, Stalinistic, Maoistic, Pol Pot-ish to the 10th power.
[01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:29.391]  Absolutely.
[01:27:29.391 --> 01:27:44.783]  One thing, again, to your credit, I had the displeasure of watching that National Geographic hit piece, and it must have actually killed them to admit that a third of the people who were polled thought that it was, in fact, an inside job.
[01:27:44.783 --> 01:27:46.625]  And that's a four-year-old!
[01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:48.486]  That's a four-year-old spin poll.
[01:27:48.486 --> 01:27:51.389]  All the other polls show at least 65 percent.
[01:27:51.389 --> 01:27:53.430]  So they're really in trouble then.
[01:27:53.430 --> 01:27:53.731]  Yes.
[01:27:53.731 --> 01:27:56.273]  Okay, Alex, thank you so much.
[01:27:56.676 --> 01:27:58.177]  Hey, happy birthday, Stuart.
[01:27:58.177 --> 01:27:58.697]  Thank you.
[01:27:58.697 --> 01:28:00.157]  Joppa, in Texas.
[01:28:00.157 --> 01:28:04.319]  You're on the air.
[01:28:04.319 --> 01:28:05.319]  Hey, Alex.
[01:28:05.319 --> 01:28:09.020]  Hey, Joppa.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:13.702]  I've been listening to you for a long time, and I really enjoy your show.
[01:28:13.702 --> 01:28:16.163]  But I wanted to ask you a few questions.
[01:28:16.163 --> 01:28:20.344]  There's a book I read a while back that a lot of the things you talk about kind of remind me of.
[01:28:20.344 --> 01:28:21.625]  It's the Revelation book.
[01:28:21.625 --> 01:28:22.365]  Have you ever read it?
[01:28:23.121 --> 01:28:23.821]  No, I don't.
[01:28:23.821 --> 01:28:25.923]  By who?
[01:28:25.923 --> 01:28:28.124]  The General Witness Organization.
[01:28:28.124 --> 01:28:30.385]  No.
[01:28:30.385 --> 01:28:31.585]  That was one question.
[01:28:31.585 --> 01:28:39.709]  Another question was about the radio, the small wave radio station that you can buy.
[01:28:39.709 --> 01:28:41.690]  Where can I find it on the internet?
[01:28:41.690 --> 01:28:45.152]  I think you're on an IP phone or cell.
[01:28:45.152 --> 01:28:46.473]  What radio system do you want to buy?
[01:28:46.473 --> 01:28:47.013]  I couldn't hear you.
[01:28:47.911 --> 01:28:51.916]  You talked about a shortwave radio system that you can buy for yourself.
[01:28:51.916 --> 01:28:53.317]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:53.317 --> 01:29:06.791]  There's a bunch of FCC approved AM systems and we've promoted, I think it's what, Truth AM or something, I forget the exact address, that's got a good system that can go out a mile, two, three miles, and is FCC approved.
[01:29:07.572 --> 01:29:07.852]  Oh, okay.
[01:29:07.852 --> 01:29:13.195]  And another thing I was going to tell you about in Uvalde, Texas, where I live, there was a, one of the FEMA
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:41.805]  I guess you could say putt set up at the fairgrounds lately.
[01:29:41.805 --> 01:29:42.206]  Stay there.
[01:29:42.206 --> 01:29:46.170]  I want to hear about their brainwashing on the other side as they federalize everything.
[01:29:46.170 --> 01:29:47.932]  Stewart Howell, we are Change LA.
[01:29:47.932 --> 01:29:51.496]  Coming up, this is the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:51.496 --> 01:29:52.878]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.878 --> 01:29:55.421]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.421 --> 01:29:58.104]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.447 --> 01:30:05.754]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:30:05.754 --> 01:30:10.280]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:12.563]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[01:30:12.563 --> 01:30:14.185]  You don't have to cooperate.
[01:30:14.185 --> 01:30:15.227]  There is a solution.
[01:30:15.447 --> 01:30:23.875]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:04.764]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[01:31:04.764 --> 01:31:06.766]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[01:31:06.766 --> 01:31:15.295]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[01:31:15.295 --> 01:31:20.860]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[01:31:20.860 --> 01:31:22.462]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[01:31:22.702 --> 01:31:29.225]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[01:31:29.225 --> 01:31:40.270]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent light sterilization techniques.
[01:31:40.270 --> 01:31:40.730]  That's right.
[01:31:41.030 --> 01:31:43.592]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[01:31:43.592 --> 01:31:45.413]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-6043.

[01:32:00.945 --> 01:32:07.646]  In the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:32:07.646 --> 01:32:23.869]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:32:23.869 --> 01:32:29.010]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:32:29.230 --> 01:32:35.754]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:32:35.754 --> 01:32:39.636]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:32:39.636 --> 01:32:42.338]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:32:42.338 --> 01:32:47.701]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:32:48.001 --> 01:32:50.683]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:32:50.683 --> 01:32:52.905]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:32:52.905 --> 01:32:55.406]  That's MySolarBackup.com.

[01:33:18.251 --> 01:33:23.172]  And it isn't about glitz and glamour, it's about information.
[01:33:23.172 --> 01:33:25.913]  It's about changing the world.
[01:33:25.913 --> 01:33:27.874]  Leaving your mark.
[01:33:27.874 --> 01:33:32.895]  Teaching the people around you that they have incredible power.
[01:33:32.895 --> 01:33:37.917]  And I will not submit to these degenerate eugenicists.
[01:33:37.917 --> 01:33:42.078]  I will not go quietly into the night in their scientific dictatorship.
[01:33:43.863 --> 01:34:05.962]  I declare the universal right in all of the space-time continuum of a free, conscious, sentient being to have liberty and freedom!
[01:34:05.962 --> 01:34:09.965]  Bottom line, I'm standing up.
[01:34:09.965 --> 01:34:11.807]  I'm sucking a lot of air into my lungs.
[01:34:14.189 --> 01:34:16.591]  And I'm tasting life.
[01:34:16.591 --> 01:34:30.085]  Yeah, I'm getting up on the catapult.
[01:34:30.085 --> 01:34:32.367]  I got the ace card.
[01:34:32.367 --> 01:34:34.609]  If you think I sit around.
[01:34:53.671 --> 01:35:01.675]  Another thing coming!
[01:35:01.675 --> 01:35:04.737]  You know, I use popular culture as a benchmark.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:12.661]  And Muse is one of the top rock bands in the world now.
[01:35:12.661 --> 01:35:15.681]  We've had Mr. Bellamy on the show, found out he was a fan.
[01:35:15.681 --> 01:35:19.902]  He wears Terror Storm t-shirts on stage, live on BBC.
[01:35:19.902 --> 01:35:21.903]  We're going to work on getting him back on the show.
[01:35:21.903 --> 01:35:30.124]  Also, we had Dave Mustaine of Megadeth, formerly, of course, you know, one of the founders of Metallica.
[01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:34.745]  And I remember growing up as a teenager, a fan of their music because it was talking about world government tyranny,
[01:35:35.950 --> 01:35:39.214]  I didn't really understand it when I was listening to it, but at an instinctive level I did.
[01:35:39.214 --> 01:35:43.478]  Dave is actually a Christian and he exposes the UN and the world government.
[01:35:43.478 --> 01:35:47.222]  We got him on and I said, hey, he was familiar with some of my work.
[01:35:47.222 --> 01:35:50.186]  I talked to him off air and I said, hey, give me an address.
[01:35:52.441 --> 01:35:54.583]  And I want to send you my new film, Endgame.
[01:35:54.583 --> 01:35:55.463]  It's about a year and a half ago.
[01:35:55.463 --> 01:35:56.624]  I've been out about six, eight months.
[01:35:56.624 --> 01:35:58.205]  And he said, sure.
[01:35:58.205 --> 01:36:02.169]  Their new album coming out in four days is titled Endgame.
[01:36:02.169 --> 01:36:06.052]  And all over the big rock and roll websites and news sites are saying, what is this cover?
[01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:08.193]  It's a different type of Megadeth cover.
[01:36:08.193 --> 01:36:10.135]  What is it?
[01:36:10.135 --> 01:36:12.937]  And it says, Endgame, and it shows people in a death pit.
[01:36:14.638 --> 01:36:17.579]  In a shooter pit, where they put you in a pit to shoot you.
[01:36:17.579 --> 01:36:24.382]  And around them are stacked plastic coffins from the famous FEMA coffin videos that we've covered here.
[01:36:24.382 --> 01:36:26.643]  And it's in-game.
[01:36:26.643 --> 01:36:29.745]  And then on all these sites, when people comment, they go, no, it's Alex Jones.
[01:36:29.745 --> 01:36:31.005]  It's in-game.
[01:36:31.005 --> 01:36:36.648]  I mean, absolutely amazing the way we're affecting change out there.
[01:36:36.648 --> 01:36:39.369]  And, I mean, I've told people.
[01:36:39.369 --> 01:36:40.489]  I'm not bragging about me.
[01:36:40.489 --> 01:36:42.030]  This is actually a dangerous position to be in.
[01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:47.401]  Look, I've climbed Mount Everest, now I've got to get back down.
[01:36:47.401 --> 01:36:55.744]  Most people that die don't die going up, they die going down because they're exhausted once they get up there, they're out of oxygen.
[01:36:55.744 --> 01:37:04.727]  But when I take three trips to LA, six flights and four of the flights leaving Austin, coming back in LA, the TSA are fans.
[01:37:04.727 --> 01:37:07.148]  The police come up and are fans.
[01:37:07.148 --> 01:37:09.428]  They're asking for autographs.
[01:37:09.428 --> 01:37:10.689]  I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:37:11.812 --> 01:37:18.359]  I better do a good job here because we are reaching millions of new people a week.
[01:37:18.359 --> 01:37:25.347]  And the only reason I'm alive is because the good Lord above and because the globalists don't want to kill me and highlight and underline everything I've said and done.
[01:37:25.347 --> 01:37:27.449]  Because they know it's spot on.
[01:37:27.449 --> 01:37:29.251]  Because I've done my homework.
[01:37:29.251 --> 01:37:31.214]  I've studied how they operate.
[01:37:31.214 --> 01:37:31.995]  I've seen their tricks.
[01:37:33.234 --> 01:37:43.483]  It's like I'm a hunter and I've learned what my prey in the info war, I've learned their tricks and I have become pretty good at it.
[01:37:43.483 --> 01:37:44.624]  I'm certainly not a master.
[01:37:44.624 --> 01:37:45.846]  No one is a master.
[01:37:45.846 --> 01:37:51.971]  As you become a master, you learn that you're really not a master.
[01:37:51.971 --> 01:37:54.774]  But the circle is not yet complete.
[01:37:54.774 --> 01:37:57.036]  We are still continuing to grow and doing our work here.
[01:38:00.052 --> 01:38:02.133]  Oh, but it is just breathtaking.
[01:38:02.133 --> 01:38:06.996]  I want to go to Stuart Howe of We Are Change Los Angeles, and then we just got a call from Mark Dice.
[01:38:06.996 --> 01:38:09.437]  I want to get him on in a few minutes.
[01:38:09.437 --> 01:38:12.319]  Did you guys get that number from Burmese?
[01:38:12.319 --> 01:38:13.940]  Mark Dice got into Limbaugh.
[01:38:13.940 --> 01:38:14.580]  Good job, Mark.
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:15.681]  We'll hear about that.
[01:38:15.681 --> 01:38:16.601]  A great info warrior.
[01:38:16.601 --> 01:38:19.122]  Another example of what one man can do when he takes action.
[01:38:19.122 --> 01:38:20.323]  Or one woman.
[01:38:20.323 --> 01:38:22.124]  But Stuart Howe.
[01:38:22.124 --> 01:38:25.086]  We Are Change LA.
[01:38:25.086 --> 01:38:26.386]  Charlie, by the way, salutes you.
[01:38:26.386 --> 01:38:29.288]  Said he ran into you at a shopping, at a grocery store.
[01:38:30.598 --> 01:38:32.779]  I think it's amazing.
[01:38:32.779 --> 01:38:35.161]  I think it's amazing what you and Charlie and everybody's doing.
[01:38:56.474 --> 01:38:57.595]  I think it's catching on.
[01:38:57.595 --> 01:39:07.161]  I was very, very excited to see Congressman Joe Wilson stand up and, you know, speak some truth to power and point out that Obama was lying.
[01:39:07.161 --> 01:39:16.987]  You know, I think it's catching on and people are seeing a lot of examples of standing up against tyranny and being willing to question and call things as they are.
[01:39:16.987 --> 01:39:18.088]  And that's exciting.
[01:39:18.088 --> 01:39:21.350]  It's catching on everywhere and I think it's going to continue to do so.
[01:39:26.820 --> 01:39:29.221]  Well, you're just doing a great job, Stuart.
[01:39:29.221 --> 01:39:31.021]  What are you reflecting on this 9-11?
[01:39:31.021 --> 01:39:33.642]  What is We Are Change LA doing?
[01:39:33.642 --> 01:39:49.168]  Well, we've got a big street action out of the Sherman Oaks Galleria this afternoon, and people can log on to WeAreChangeLA.org, W-A-C-L-A dot org, and find the details for that, as well as the screening of Luke's Change American Coup tonight.
[01:39:49.168 --> 01:39:50.268]  So that's all going on.
[01:39:50.268 --> 01:39:52.789]  Of course, Bruno and Katie are out with Luke in New York.
[01:39:54.381 --> 01:39:55.741]  And we're just doing everything we can.
[01:39:55.741 --> 01:39:57.682]  You know, we had a big run to D.C.
[01:39:57.682 --> 01:40:17.368]  a while back and, you know, got in Jay Rockefeller's face and we're trying to take every opportunity we can to get the truth out and to show people, perhaps more importantly than the facts and evidence, that we can stand up with those facts and evidence that is on our side and truth and everything that's good is on our side.
[01:40:17.368 --> 01:40:22.049]  And we're just standing up every chance we get and more people are joining us and it's great to see.
[01:40:23.214 --> 01:40:30.976]  I do want to go ahead and talk about an observation, since you brought up Senator John Rockefeller, goes by Jay.
[01:40:30.976 --> 01:40:48.841]  It appears in the last six months or so, the mantle of power from the 94-year-old David Rockefeller, who is definitely at the very top of the pyramid, with the Queen of England and the Queen of the Netherlands, along with Lord Rothschild, those four people are at the pinnacle, at the paramount level.
[01:40:50.816 --> 01:40:56.363]  That the mantle is being passed as we speak from the 94-year-old David Rockefeller.
[01:40:56.363 --> 01:40:56.664]  Maybe 95 now.
[01:40:58.456 --> 01:41:08.405]  To Senator Jay Rockefeller of the dynasty, and he is the guy honchoing the cybersecurity takeover of the web, openly announcing it's to end free speech and take it over.
[01:41:08.405 --> 01:41:14.431]  He is the one honchoing the expansion of Homeland Security and Brigade Homeland 400,000 troops to operate inside the US.
[01:41:14.431 --> 01:41:16.953]  He is the one honchoing the new wars.
[01:41:16.953 --> 01:41:19.575]  He is the one honchoing the new eugenics operations.
[01:41:19.575 --> 01:41:23.839]  He is the one, admittedly, that is giving the game plan and marching orders to Obama.
[01:41:24.620 --> 01:41:30.444]  He has now eclipsed Kissinger and David Rockefeller, and I will now list him as the head of the United States.
[01:41:30.444 --> 01:41:35.267]  The true governor of North America is Jay Rockefeller.
[01:41:35.267 --> 01:41:38.849]  I've been meaning to say this the last few months, but I wanted to be sure.
[01:41:38.849 --> 01:41:46.214]  But now, the true governor of North America, and probably this entire hemisphere, is Jay Rockefeller.
[01:41:46.214 --> 01:41:48.016]  And you confronted the Supreme Leader.
[01:41:48.016 --> 01:41:50.577]  You and Luke Hradowski did a fabulous job, along with other We Are Changers.
[01:41:50.577 --> 01:41:53.059]  We're going to be putting that in Fall of the Republic.
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.803]  And the eugenics section.
[01:41:56.803 --> 01:41:58.745]  But just absolutely amazing job.
[01:41:58.745 --> 01:42:00.287]  You were there in Congress.
[01:42:00.287 --> 01:42:07.416]  Tell folks briefly about the documentation on the thermite, the thermetical explosive devices in the towers and what you delivered to Congress.
[01:42:08.516 --> 01:42:11.958]  Well, we delivered them a package, a pretty inclusive package.
[01:42:11.958 --> 01:42:13.939]  It had the ThermAid papers.
[01:42:13.939 --> 01:42:17.301]  It had the links between NIST and NanoThermAid.
[01:42:17.301 --> 01:42:24.126]  It had a cover letter letting them know that it was time for them to stand up and side with the truth and to look at this information.
[01:42:24.126 --> 01:42:27.908]  They can no longer hide behind plausible deniability.
[01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.849]  That was no longer possible.
[01:42:29.849 --> 01:42:33.391]  And we were documenting all of this and putting it in their hands.
[01:42:33.391 --> 01:42:37.894]  And it's just, we're making it harder and harder for them to stand behind this hoax.
[01:42:39.031 --> 01:42:48.013]  And it's an amazing thing to see the reaction that we get from these people, and to have them on record, because their hoax is falling apart.
[01:42:48.013 --> 01:43:03.317]  It's a house of cards, and now that there's so many different viewing angles into this, through the financial collapse, through the swine flu hoax, through the hoax war on terror, through all this great information you guys are showcasing with Charlie about 9-11, people are beginning
[01:43:03.937 --> 01:43:11.239]  To be willing to look at the totality of the situation and see that there are other people addressing it squarely.
[01:43:11.239 --> 01:43:13.200]  And that's what we put in Congress' hands.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:19.361]  The information and a cover letter stating that we, the people, expect them to address this squarely.
[01:43:19.361 --> 01:43:24.503]  And if they do, we stand with them.
[01:43:24.503 --> 01:43:25.723]  Well, it's exciting.
[01:43:25.723 --> 01:43:27.563]  It's exciting what you're doing.
[01:43:27.563 --> 01:43:29.444]  Continue to tell us about what We Are Change is up to.
[01:43:30.902 --> 01:43:33.464]  Well, you know, we're working with the police.
[01:43:33.464 --> 01:43:35.686]  We're working with the Oath Keepers.
[01:43:35.686 --> 01:43:49.477]  We're basically looking for every chance we can to get in front of notable people and ask real questions as politely as we can to bring some reality to this puppet show.
[01:43:49.477 --> 01:43:52.479]  And everything that we can do, we are doing.
[01:43:52.479 --> 01:43:54.961]  We're always looking for opportunities.
[01:43:54.961 --> 01:43:57.703]  We've got a lot of ongoing things in the works.
[01:43:59.631 --> 01:44:02.773]  And we know we're just kind of hitting it from every angle we can.
[01:44:02.773 --> 01:44:05.775]  We've got a lot of diverse people in the group.
[01:44:05.775 --> 01:44:11.660]  And right now we're really reaching out to law enforcement and military with Oath Keepers as best we can.
[01:44:11.660 --> 01:44:19.085]  That's very important right now, you know, to let these people know that we stand with them and they're with us, that we're on the same page.
[01:44:19.085 --> 01:44:27.250]  And to try to stop this attempt to divide the people from the police, the people from the military and government.
[01:44:27.250 --> 01:44:27.831]  Absolutely.
[01:44:28.871 --> 01:44:33.135]  Yeah, we're trying to, you know, we're trying to let them know that we're not kooks.
[01:44:33.135 --> 01:44:40.623]  We're trying to, uh, you know, let them know that we're just thoughtful, patriotic Americans that are standing with the principles that built this country.
[01:44:40.623 --> 01:44:41.704]  Well, look, Stewart.
[01:44:41.704 --> 01:44:42.925]  Look, Stewart.
[01:44:42.925 --> 01:44:49.712]  Six of the ten commission members say it was a fraud and criminal and a cover-up and it should be criminally investigated, not just a new congressional investigation.
[01:44:50.673 --> 01:44:51.313]  It is.
[01:44:51.313 --> 01:44:52.074]  It very much is.
[01:45:10.629 --> 01:45:26.234]  No, no, I want to keep you there, but I want to bring up Mark Dice of MarkDice.com, who is again a great activist for liberty and freedom, the author of the Resistance Manifesto, that we incidentally carry both of his books, and he's written at InfoWars.com on the bookstore.
[01:45:26.234 --> 01:45:29.396]  Folks want to find out more about Mark Dice there at InfoWars.com.
[01:45:31.112 --> 01:45:44.277]  Has reached tens of millions of people calling into Limbaugh, calling into Beck, calling into Savage, calling into just scores of different shows, and he has a lot of those, hundreds of those calls linked up on his site.
[01:45:44.277 --> 01:45:50.779]  He has now called into Lord Limbaugh, and successfully gotten Lord Limbaugh to talk about it to his 22 million listeners.
[01:45:50.779 --> 01:45:58.322]  So that's the power of just taking action, taking the gloves off, and getting in the info war, and I salute you and commend you.
[01:45:58.322 --> 01:45:59.803]  Mark Dice, Mark, let's bring you up.
[01:46:00.908 --> 01:46:11.417]  Well, thank you, and I couldn't sit idly by on the eighth anniversary and do nothing, so instead of getting involved in a march, my mornings have been consisted of trying to get through to these clowns.
[01:46:11.417 --> 01:46:18.983]  So that sitting here at my desk, I could speak to millions of people, and I luckily was able to get through to Rush Limbaugh this morning.
[01:46:18.983 --> 01:46:20.144]  The audio is being posted.
[01:46:20.144 --> 01:46:21.965]  I don't know if it's good enough to play on the air.
[01:46:21.965 --> 01:46:27.630]  It was very brief, but I did slam him and ask him what his establishment
[01:46:28.098 --> 01:46:41.443]  Friends are going to do now that the propaganda and gatekeeping that they've been attempting to do is not successful, and over a third of Americans on both political spears see the attacks as an inside job.
[01:46:41.443 --> 01:46:43.224]  The call was immediately dropped.
[01:46:43.224 --> 01:46:45.204]  It did make it out on the air.
[01:46:45.204 --> 01:46:57.249]  He did mention Charlie Sheen's letter, and I think Rush is under the impression that Charlie actually met with him, and he said that, well, I read the transcript of Sheen's interview, and if the head kook, meaning Obama,
[01:46:58.147 --> 01:47:02.088]  ...doesn't agree with us, then we're really just a bunch of kooks.
[01:47:02.088 --> 01:47:11.450]  And he went off to say that a third of the country is completely insane and that he has no hope of ever reaching us, but he's just trying to minimize the insanity.
[01:47:11.450 --> 01:47:17.832]  So it's just obvious that everybody now knows, or the majority of people, see what's going on.
[01:47:17.832 --> 01:47:27.254]  And if you look at the positive pieces that have come out from Charlie Sheen's request, it's incredible because people that work at Fox News and Reuters and other news agencies
[01:47:27.834 --> 01:47:34.660]  Actually wrote positive and fair pieces about it because I think that the writers are on our side.
[01:47:34.660 --> 01:47:35.681]  A lot of these people are.
[01:47:35.681 --> 01:47:44.769]  And if the gatekeepers can't kill the pieces before they get out to the public, I think that they're doing their best to try to present our viewpoint.
[01:47:45.049 --> 01:47:51.813]  And get it out there, because now it's been eight years of people hammering, and it's a safe environment to talk about such issues.
[01:47:51.813 --> 01:47:59.637]  And I just want to thank everyone for, you know, everyone who's wanted to know the truth, who spoke the truth, who's helped to educate their friends and their families.
[01:47:59.637 --> 01:48:06.981]  And I think that we have had a bigger impact than we think we had, although we need to continue just down the course.
[01:48:08.698 --> 01:48:10.038]  Absolutely.
[01:48:10.038 --> 01:48:15.640]  Briefly, tell listeners how they can call into these big international national shows and reach millions of people.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:17.441]  It's not that hard.
[01:48:17.441 --> 01:48:18.121]  It's not hard.
[01:48:18.121 --> 01:48:19.041]  Here's the secret.
[01:48:19.041 --> 01:48:20.621]  And Sean Hannity is going to be coming up.
[01:48:20.621 --> 01:48:21.642]  Check your time zone.
[01:48:21.642 --> 01:48:24.182]  He's coming up at noon live.
[01:48:24.182 --> 01:48:25.743]  That's Pacific time.
[01:48:25.743 --> 01:48:28.844]  You can check the phone numbers on their own websites to call in.
[01:48:28.844 --> 01:48:30.084]  Here's how you do it.
[01:48:30.084 --> 01:48:33.045]  You need to call right at the top of the hour when the show starts.
[01:48:33.690 --> 01:48:35.412]  Or even a few minutes beforehand.
[01:48:35.412 --> 01:48:51.313]  Before they give the phone number out, you have to get the phone number from the website, start calling five minutes before the show even goes live, get in the call bank, and feed them a typical left versus right question that the screener's gonna
[01:48:52.005 --> 01:48:58.667]  I think it's going to help to perpetuate the ideology and the paradigm that the talk show is designed to do.
[01:48:58.667 --> 01:49:05.189]  So I fed Rush Limbaugh's screener a nice question, got him the call bank.
[01:49:05.189 --> 01:49:09.730]  It was going to help to perpetuate his philosophy, of course.
[01:49:09.730 --> 01:49:14.111]  And then as soon as I was live, I just asked my real question.
[01:49:14.111 --> 01:49:15.632]  And that's how you do it.
[01:49:15.632 --> 01:49:19.913]  And I think that if we do this, just imagine if you keep hearing this over and over, if
[01:49:21.141 --> 01:49:36.251]  Not enlightened to these ideas and you're listening to your idol Sean Hannity and you just keep hearing these phone calls and people mentioning Operation Northwoods and Liquid Metal in the Towers and Charlie Sheen demanding a meeting with Obama.
[01:49:36.251 --> 01:49:44.737]  Millions of people are going to go and Google those issues and they're going to start to find the rabbit hole that we've all found and that's sort of been one of the ways that I've
[01:49:45.535 --> 01:49:45.815]  Thank you.
[01:50:05.392 --> 01:50:20.180]  From my home phone and I put it on speakerphone and I sit there and I surf the web and then when he goes to my call I pick up the phone and I just hit them with the real question and shock them and if you plug a website maybe it'll get out.
[01:50:20.180 --> 01:50:31.085]  I've found that if you plug issues and just bring up statements and questions it has a lot more successful percentage of getting out of the air without them using the seven second delay.
[01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:38.761]  Well done, Mark Dice, and we'll play that audio as soon as you get it posted up.
[01:50:38.761 --> 01:50:39.061]  Stay there.
[01:50:39.061 --> 01:50:51.490]  I want to say bye to both of you and get final comments from Stuart Hall, we are Change LA, and also hailing from Southern California, Mark Dice from San Diego, out there in 9-11 Truth Command Base, West Coast.
[01:50:51.490 --> 01:50:57.015]  Out there with our general on that side of the coast, Charlie Sheen.
[01:50:57.015 --> 01:50:59.517]  I'm right here in the Central Texas Command Center from Austin.
[01:51:01.463 --> 01:51:07.185]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero.
[01:51:07.185 --> 01:51:08.466]  And we knew what to do.
[01:51:08.466 --> 01:51:10.507]  Or at least we thought we did.
[01:51:10.507 --> 01:51:17.530]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[01:51:17.530 --> 01:51:26.433]  Whitman, EPA director, on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[01:51:26.433 --> 01:51:30.975]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth as brave souls throughout the world
[01:51:31.348 --> 01:51:33.529]  Take action against their global masters.
[01:51:33.529 --> 01:51:36.710]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[01:51:36.710 --> 01:51:42.492]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom!
[01:51:42.492 --> 01:51:45.553]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[01:54:21.904 --> 01:54:25.246]  Oh, they did eight years ago.
[01:54:25.246 --> 01:54:28.607]  Oh, bad, bad.
[01:54:28.607 --> 01:54:30.628]  And then Cheney got caught wanting to blow up U.S.
[01:54:30.628 --> 01:54:33.830]  ships with Navy SEALs attacking them.
[01:54:33.830 --> 01:54:39.692]  It came out that right at the time he wanted to do that, those radio transmissions came in telling the destroyers they were going to blow them up.
[01:54:39.692 --> 01:54:43.614]  Turned out it was not Iran doing it and that it was an English speaker doing it.
[01:54:44.929 --> 01:54:52.157]  The media said, oh, it was somebody just joking around the radio, like today with the ships, like today in the Potomac.
[01:54:52.157 --> 01:54:59.885]  Gentlemen, do you see through this thing, or do you agree with me this is a total psyop with Obama saying, how dare you on 9-11 scare everyone, CNN?
[01:55:02.739 --> 01:55:13.510]  Well, obviously, I think we were all suspecting that something was going to happen, some sort of fear-mongering, reminding everyone of the boogeyman that they're using to scare everyone.
[01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:19.436]  So, of course, it's no coincidence that it's on the Potomac, it's close to D.C.
[01:55:19.436 --> 01:55:23.460]  The facts will come out, but of course, since we know this issue,
[01:55:24.648 --> 01:55:27.789]  One of a string of propaganda.
[01:55:27.789 --> 01:55:28.730]  It doesn't surprise us.
[01:55:28.730 --> 01:55:29.730]  It's their MO.
[01:55:29.730 --> 01:55:31.350]  It's like a duck quacking.
[01:55:31.350 --> 01:55:32.711]  It's what they do.
[01:55:32.711 --> 01:55:35.812]  And it's like Air Force One photo op triggers panic in Manhattan.
[01:55:35.812 --> 01:55:38.293]  Turned out they engineered all that.
[01:55:38.293 --> 01:55:47.976]  Well, I think the reason why we haven't had a real attack or any real terrorists after the September 11th attacks for the last eight years is really because of the audience.
[01:55:47.976 --> 01:55:48.957]  Because everybody now
[01:55:49.665 --> 01:55:51.047]  They know we're watching.
[01:55:51.047 --> 01:55:52.309]  We're watching the magician now.
[01:55:52.309 --> 01:55:52.969]  We know it's fake.
[01:56:07.182 --> 01:56:13.707]  Yeah, so they've moved on to economic terrorism and bioterrorism and scaring everyone that they're going to get sick with the new bug.
[01:56:13.707 --> 01:56:17.350]  It's a little bit more difficult to trace.
[01:56:17.350 --> 01:56:22.654]  I agree, but they've been trying to rehabilitate their 9-11 fraud to stage more attacks.
[01:56:22.654 --> 01:56:25.456]  Let me get Stuart Howe's comment on that.
[01:56:25.456 --> 01:56:36.825]  Yeah, I think they'll look for every opportunity to manufacture the boogeyman, you know, to prop up something as an enemy, real or imagined, you know, to
[01:56:37.478 --> 01:56:39.438]  To justify everything that they're doing.
[01:56:39.438 --> 01:56:40.999]  And, you know, people are catching on.
[01:56:40.999 --> 01:56:46.760]  As Mark said, as you always point out, people are catching on and we're taking away that tool.
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:47.900]  Absolutely key, man.
[01:56:47.900 --> 01:56:48.940]  Well, we have the Limbaugh clip.
[01:56:48.940 --> 01:56:53.001]  We're going to be playing it when we come back at the 8 after when we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:56:53.001 --> 01:56:55.741]  We're about 35 minutes away from Charlie Sheen.
[01:56:55.741 --> 01:56:57.682]  Live with us, ABC News is called.
[01:56:57.682 --> 01:56:58.522]  They're going to be tuning in.
[01:56:58.522 --> 01:57:00.962]  A lot of other folks as well.
[01:57:00.962 --> 01:57:03.563]  Give us the website for We Are Change Los Angeles, Stuart.
[01:57:04.155 --> 01:57:07.678]  That's W-A-C-L-A dot O-R-G.
[01:57:07.678 --> 01:57:11.341]  And any place in the country, you can go to WeAreChange.org.
[01:57:11.341 --> 01:57:13.063]  And please, everybody, get involved.
[01:57:13.063 --> 01:57:14.905]  Go to city council meetings.
[01:57:14.905 --> 01:57:16.166]  Go to town hall meetings.
[01:57:16.166 --> 01:57:17.567]  You know, get involved.
[01:57:17.567 --> 01:57:18.928]  Look at our calendars.
[01:57:18.928 --> 01:57:21.170]  Just about every Change chapter has a calendar.
[01:57:21.170 --> 01:57:23.232]  And come out and join with us.
[01:57:23.232 --> 01:57:25.774]  It's a wonderful, wonderful thing to be part of.
[01:57:25.774 --> 01:57:30.198]  I want to thank you for having me on, and I'll stay on the line for an off-air message from Charlie.
[01:57:30.198 --> 01:57:30.659]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:57:31.101 --> 01:57:31.641]  All right, buddy.
[01:57:31.641 --> 01:57:33.022]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:33.022 --> 01:57:36.305]  Again, MarkDice.com is Mark's powerful site.
[01:57:36.305 --> 01:57:37.206]  A lot of tools there.
[01:57:37.206 --> 01:57:40.628]  You can learn how to take them on in the unique way Mark does it there.
[01:57:40.628 --> 01:57:42.089]  Very successful.
[01:57:42.089 --> 01:57:43.971]  One man has reached tens of millions.
[01:57:43.971 --> 01:57:51.936]  And also, we carry both of his books at InfoWars.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[01:57:51.936 --> 01:57:54.538]  Mark Dice, thank you so much for all you do, my friend.
[01:57:54.538 --> 01:57:55.379]  God bless you.
[01:57:55.379 --> 01:57:56.680]  And Charlie Sheen, God bless you.
[01:57:57.785 --> 01:57:59.046]  All right, take care.
[01:57:59.046 --> 01:58:00.366]  There he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:00.366 --> 01:58:10.110]  I'm going to come back and into some other news the night after we go live at PrisonPlanet.tv, simulcasting the last hour and 52 minutes via television on the web at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:10.110 --> 01:58:11.771]  If you're not a member, it's 15 cents a day.
[01:58:11.771 --> 01:58:13.071]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:58:13.071 --> 01:58:19.274]  All my books, films, all posted there in super high quality and the live show in the archives of the show in better quality.
[01:58:19.274 --> 01:58:19.854]  What is it?
[01:58:19.854 --> 01:58:22.155]  64-bit audio from the show archived there as well.
[01:58:22.155 --> 01:58:22.796]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:25.444 --> 01:58:27.124]  Again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:27.124 --> 01:58:30.645]  I want to thank all the members there because they make so much of what we do possible.
[01:58:30.645 --> 01:58:37.527]  If you're not a member of PrisonPlanet.tv or your membership lapsed, be sure and get it again because it also supports us.
[01:58:37.527 --> 01:58:38.767]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:38.767 --> 01:58:43.249]  Stay with us.
[01:58:43.249 --> 01:58:45.749]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.749 --> 01:58:48.050]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.779 --> 01:58:56.005]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:56.005 --> 01:59:00.030]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:05.936]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.936 --> 01:59:11.002]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.002 --> 01:59:11.503]  Number three,
[01:59:11.903 --> 01:59:18.207]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:59:18.207 --> 01:59:21.089]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:59:21.089 --> 01:59:25.612]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:25.612 --> 01:59:29.234]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:29.454 --> 01:59:35.199]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:59:35.199 --> 01:59:39.904]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.904 --> 01:59:41.665]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[01:59:53.883 --> 01:59:56.264]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.264 --> 02:00:05.610]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.610 --> 02:00:06.910]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.910 --> 02:00:08.671]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.671 --> 02:00:10.432]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.432 --> 02:00:12.033]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.033 --> 02:00:13.954]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.954 --> 02:00:17.757]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.757 --> 02:00:21.819]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.752 --> 02:00:25.934]  Okay, we're going to get Bob Chapman popping in.
[02:00:25.934 --> 02:00:29.636]  In fact, we'll just do it right now for part of this segment and then the next.
[02:00:29.636 --> 02:00:34.080]  And Charlie Sheen is coming up, and I wanted to give you some economic news as well.
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:36.521]  We'll continue with your phone calls.
[02:00:36.521 --> 02:00:40.144]  Lauren, Tommy, Michael, Paul, Dustin, Danny, others.
[02:00:40.144 --> 02:00:47.209]  But we're going to get a quick economic update from Bob Chapman, the international forecaster, right now.
[02:00:47.209 --> 02:00:49.451]  Bob, I just can't toot his horn enough.
[02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:58.619]  He said six, eight months ago, and I read the newsletter we posted up on Infowars.com, excerpts of it every week, comes out twice a week.
[02:00:58.619 --> 02:01:05.325]  He said, no, they're going to run the market back up to near its previous levels and then drop it again early fall.
[02:01:05.325 --> 02:01:07.708]  I mean, this guy's got a crystal ball.
[02:01:07.708 --> 02:01:10.671]  And he said just a few weeks ago, he goes, you better get out of the stock market.
[02:01:10.671 --> 02:01:11.452]  It's going to be going down.
[02:01:13.081 --> 02:01:17.223]  And he talked about how gold by the early fall would go above $1,000.
[02:01:17.223 --> 02:01:19.403]  Went back when it was $890.
[02:01:19.403 --> 02:01:22.704]  And here we are at $1,013 last time I checked a few hours ago.
[02:01:22.704 --> 02:01:25.565]  I don't know what it is now, but it is just wild.
[02:01:25.565 --> 02:01:31.207]  And then we have open announcements at AP, Reuters, New Bank of the World, global carbon taxes to fund it.
[02:01:31.207 --> 02:01:34.129]  The dollar's gonna be like Argentina soon, top economist.
[02:01:34.129 --> 02:01:36.429]  I'm not saying that's gonna happen, they're saying it.
[02:01:36.429 --> 02:01:38.010]  So we see a shift now.
[02:01:39.534 --> 02:01:45.298]  To them stampeding people and saying you gotta accept world government only it will save you.
[02:01:45.298 --> 02:01:47.460]  Bob Chapman, what in Hades is going on?
[02:01:47.460 --> 02:01:57.507]  I think it's exactly what you're saying, Alex, is that you ought to be happy that we're going to form a new currency so that you all won't be out of luck.
[02:01:57.507 --> 02:02:02.991]  When in fact is they're using the dollars collapse as an excuse along with
[02:02:03.473 --> 02:02:10.295]  A number of other things, and you know, the UN never says anything about the dollar or currencies or gold.
[02:02:10.295 --> 02:02:11.935]  It's highly unusual.
[02:02:11.935 --> 02:02:17.677]  And so there's obviously a concentrated effort to get people to think that they need a new currency.
[02:02:17.677 --> 02:02:21.077]  They may need a new currency for trade, but for trade only.
[02:02:21.077 --> 02:02:25.599]  I mean, if the dollar's going to go down versus other major currencies, that's fine.
[02:02:25.599 --> 02:02:26.579]  It deserves to go down.
[02:02:26.579 --> 02:02:27.479]  It's a free market.
[02:02:28.223 --> 02:02:30.644]  Well, at least partially free market.
[02:02:30.644 --> 02:02:35.306]  Our government is in there all the time doing things that they shouldn't be doing.
[02:02:35.306 --> 02:02:38.887]  But the point is that the dollar's headed lower.
[02:02:38.887 --> 02:02:41.268]  The market's going to start to go down soon.
[02:02:41.268 --> 02:02:43.429]  We've already broken $1,000.
[02:02:43.429 --> 02:02:45.310]  Not as good as when you last looked.
[02:02:45.310 --> 02:02:45.470]  It's $1,005.60.
[02:02:45.470 --> 02:02:46.530]  It's gyrating.
[02:02:46.530 --> 02:02:47.911]  Yeah, that's good.
[02:02:47.911 --> 02:02:49.231]  What's that?
[02:02:49.231 --> 02:02:49.972]  It's gyrating.
[02:02:53.982 --> 02:02:55.163]  It's gyrating.
[02:02:55.163 --> 02:03:06.815]  And that's normal, especially on a Friday, because you often see, both in gold and silver and other things, like gold and silver shares or regular shares, people take profits on Friday.
[02:03:06.815 --> 02:03:10.038]  They don't want to be long or short over the weekend very often.
[02:03:10.038 --> 02:03:13.921]  So it's not unusual, but it was a very good day, very good week.
[02:03:13.921 --> 02:03:16.244]  And so gold has broken out.
[02:03:16.244 --> 02:03:17.385]  Gold is going to go higher.
[02:03:18.309 --> 02:03:21.612]  And, uh, it's a very, very, very strong indication.
[02:03:21.612 --> 02:03:33.801]  And, of course, the technical aspects of this is a reverse head and shoulders and the right hand, uh, part of the shoulder, uh, that you can see when you look at it visually, it's broken out.
[02:03:33.801 --> 02:03:40.746]  And usually they'll spike and it'll either go to 1200 or 1700, somewhere up in there.
[02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:42.548]  And that's quite a move.
[02:03:42.548 --> 02:03:44.129]  And so the people who are long golden,
[02:03:44.654 --> 02:03:48.658]  Silver coins are going to do quite well and of course bullion and shares as well.
[02:03:48.658 --> 02:03:58.086]  But the point here is that they are conjuring up under this cover of the dollar and other things that they want another currency.
[02:03:58.086 --> 02:04:01.129]  And they're going to keep it up and keep it up and keep it up.
[02:04:01.129 --> 02:04:03.531]  And sooner or later they're going to try it.
[02:04:03.531 --> 02:04:04.992]  And so don't be surprised.
[02:04:04.992 --> 02:04:05.793]  That's what they're after.
[02:04:09.130 --> 02:04:22.364]  Well, Bob, so I mean, do you agree with all these top economists saying, I mean, they wouldn't be putting them in the newspaper saying we're going to see an Argentine situation in the next few years for the dollar unless the establishment at some level wants that to happen?
[02:04:22.364 --> 02:04:25.407]  Or, I mean, what's behind that?
[02:04:25.407 --> 02:04:31.053]  Well, I think they want to forewarn you that they were candid with you in telling you that
[02:04:31.898 --> 02:04:34.200]  This, in fact, is going to happen.
[02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:36.661]  And it probably is going to happen.
[02:04:36.661 --> 02:04:49.169]  I've been saying now two and a half years, maybe two years, maybe less, that we're going to have an official default.
[02:04:49.169 --> 02:04:50.409]  Stay there, stay there, we've got a break.
[02:04:50.409 --> 02:04:56.653]  But yes, I remember you a year and a half ago going, no Alex, it's going to happen in two and a half to three years.
[02:04:56.653 --> 02:04:59.515]  And now we're a year and a half into it and it looks like Bob's right as usual.
[02:05:01.206 --> 02:05:04.228]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.228 --> 02:05:09.553]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:09.553 --> 02:05:11.614]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:11.614 --> 02:05:16.598]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:16.598 --> 02:05:17.519]  How much do you want?
[02:05:17.779 --> 02:05:18.900]  When do you want it?
[02:05:18.900 --> 02:05:20.781]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:20.781 --> 02:05:21.862]  When will you need it?
[02:05:21.862 --> 02:05:24.063]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.063 --> 02:05:25.404]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.404 --> 02:05:26.925]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:26.925 --> 02:05:32.209]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.209 --> 02:05:35.791]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:35.791 --> 02:05:39.254]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:39.594 --> 02:05:40.815]  How much will you need?
[02:05:40.815 --> 02:05:41.735]  We don't know.
[02:05:41.735 --> 02:05:42.835]  How much do you want?
[02:05:42.835 --> 02:05:43.756]  All you can get.
[02:05:43.756 --> 02:05:44.856]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:44.856 --> 02:05:47.898]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:47.898 --> 02:05:49.678]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:49.678 --> 02:05:50.599]  Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.250 --> 02:06:04.491]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[02:06:04.491 --> 02:06:06.491]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[02:06:06.491 --> 02:06:15.013]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[02:06:15.013 --> 02:06:20.555]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[02:06:20.555 --> 02:06:22.175]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[02:06:22.415 --> 02:06:28.940]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:39.989]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[02:06:39.989 --> 02:06:40.770]  That's right.
[02:06:40.770 --> 02:06:43.332]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[02:06:43.332 --> 02:06:44.914]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[02:06:47.475 --> 02:07:05.221]  Thomas Jefferson once said, When the people fear their government, there is tyranny.
[02:07:05.221 --> 02:07:08.482]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:07:08.482 --> 02:07:16.285]  Our God-given right to life and liberty and the right to determine what is best for our lives and our family's health are in jeopardy if we the people
[02:07:16.545 --> 02:07:18.786]  Do not diligently assert these rights.
[02:07:18.786 --> 02:07:21.147]  They may be taken away and lost forever.
[02:07:21.147 --> 02:07:27.970]  Utopia Silver is known for fighting for health freedom and we will not meekly allow ourselves to be led as lambs to the slaughter.
[02:07:27.970 --> 02:07:34.153]  Sitting passively by and accepting the chains of slavery that are being placed on America is not an option.
[02:07:34.153 --> 02:07:36.734]  Please stand with Utopia Silver in this fight.
[02:07:36.734 --> 02:07:44.117]  Utopia Silver carries some of the most effective colloidal silver products on the market and numerous other high quality health supplements.

[02:07:46.999 --> 02:07:50.963]  That's U-T-O-P-I-A, utopiasilver.com.
[02:07:50.963 --> 02:07:54.285]  Or call us today at 1-888-213-4338.
[02:07:54.285 --> 02:07:54.646]  1-888-213-4338.
[02:07:54.646 --> 02:08:09.258]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.258 --> 02:08:12.241]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.065 --> 02:08:18.347]  Charlie, it's great to be here with you.
[02:08:18.347 --> 02:08:20.469]  I appreciate you doing this interview.
[02:08:20.469 --> 02:08:21.150]  Likewise, Alex.
[02:08:21.150 --> 02:08:21.871]  Thank you.
[02:08:21.871 --> 02:08:26.616]  Why, after three years of silence concerning 9-11, are you now speaking up?
[02:08:26.616 --> 02:08:32.322]  And why have you written this public letter that you've now published?
[02:08:32.322 --> 02:08:33.143]  Well, Alex...
[02:08:34.924 --> 02:08:37.886]  I wrote this letter for two reasons.
[02:08:37.886 --> 02:08:44.432]  Firstly, I wanted to create a public document specifically rooted in fact.
[02:08:44.432 --> 02:08:51.858]  If anybody dares question that, I would encourage those people to scrutinize it, to research it.
[02:08:53.619 --> 02:08:57.341]  The truth is unchanging, Alex, as we both know.
[02:08:57.341 --> 02:09:02.785]  The only aspect of this piece that had to be manufactured were the President's words.
[02:09:02.785 --> 02:09:09.189]  Everything else will withstand the critical assault I'm more than prepared to endure.
[02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:17.213]  And secondly, this is our first new President since 9-11, and consequently his first 9-11 anniversary in office.
[02:09:19.252 --> 02:09:20.373]  Enough stonewalling.
[02:09:20.373 --> 02:09:22.635]  Enough media manipulation.
[02:09:22.635 --> 02:09:25.718]  Enough media mantra speak.
[02:09:25.718 --> 02:09:27.940]  The families deserve better, Alex.
[02:09:27.940 --> 02:09:29.842]  America deserves better.
[02:09:29.842 --> 02:09:31.203]  I mean, come on.
[02:09:31.203 --> 02:09:32.024]  Come on, people.
[02:09:32.024 --> 02:09:36.969]  The 9-11 Commission report is a blatant work of manipulation, secrecy, and fiction.
[02:09:37.938 --> 02:09:39.780]  Come on, the time is now.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:42.143]  Demand the truth.
[02:09:42.143 --> 02:09:50.972]  I personally cannot stand idly by any longer and pretend like a new investigation is just going to fall out of the heavens right into our Congress.
[02:09:50.972 --> 02:09:52.534]  We have to take action.
[02:09:52.534 --> 02:09:53.515]  We have to stand as one.
[02:09:53.515 --> 02:09:56.659]  We must insist that our new president deliver on his promises.
[02:09:58.081 --> 02:10:01.284]  All right, that's Charlie Sheen from my taped interview with him.
[02:10:01.284 --> 02:10:03.505]  In 20 minutes, he's going to be live with us here on air.
[02:10:03.505 --> 02:10:09.010]  We're going to have Bob up for a full hour next week because I really want to get to the economy with him.
[02:10:09.010 --> 02:10:11.432]  We've got this Limbaugh clip of him talking about it today.
[02:10:11.432 --> 02:10:17.476]  It's kind of hammered audio, but we're going to play it in about 10 minutes when Bob leaves us.
[02:10:17.476 --> 02:10:22.000]  But again, 33 after, bottom of this hour, we're going to go to Charlie Sheen live here on air.
[02:10:24.884 --> 02:10:30.126]  Bob, I want to get your comments on what Charlie and I are doing and the American people and people of the world are doing right now.
[02:10:30.126 --> 02:10:32.106]  Kind of our side up against the globalists.
[02:10:32.106 --> 02:10:39.629]  But before we do that, finishing up, clearly then, do you believe they're deciding to abandon the dollar?
[02:10:39.629 --> 02:10:42.470]  The Chinese are saying they may abandon the dollar.
[02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:43.650]  What is happening right now?
[02:10:43.650 --> 02:10:45.331]  Why is gold shot up to above $1,013 today?
[02:10:45.331 --> 02:10:45.871]  Flight to quality.
[02:10:49.535 --> 02:10:55.378]  Yes, they are afraid of the abandoning of the dollar because people don't see much, if any, inflation at all.
[02:10:55.378 --> 02:10:57.239]  So that can be the only reason why it's up.
[02:10:57.239 --> 02:11:05.063]  And I think, as I said before, down the line, and I don't know how far, six months, two and a half years, I don't know.
[02:11:05.063 --> 02:11:10.226]  I do know that they are going to devalue the dollar officially, and they're going to default
[02:11:10.686 --> 02:11:32.920]  Simultaneously, at some meeting like the Smithsonian they had in the early 70s, or the Plaza Record they had in 85 in Paris, and there's going to be revaluation and devaluation, currency against currency, and I think there's going to be a debt default of perhaps two-thirds of debt of all of those who are in debt to clean the whole mess up.
[02:11:32.920 --> 02:11:38.423]  And at the same time, I think what they want to do, what they should do for international trade, is
[02:11:39.634 --> 02:11:52.201]  A 20 nation international unit made up of all those currencies plus a 10% balance of gold within that unit.
[02:11:52.201 --> 02:11:54.762]  And then it'll be perfectly acceptable for trade.
[02:11:54.762 --> 02:11:56.243]  Now Bob, let's explain.
[02:11:56.243 --> 02:12:00.485]  People are going to spend this saying Bob Chapman's with a straw man argument.
[02:12:01.556 --> 02:12:03.257]  Bob Chapman's calling for global currency.
[02:12:03.257 --> 02:12:03.777]  No.
[02:12:03.777 --> 02:12:05.178]  They're killing the dollar.
[02:12:05.178 --> 02:12:06.919]  They've hoarded out.
[02:12:06.919 --> 02:12:08.159]  They've maxed it out.
[02:12:08.159 --> 02:12:14.102]  They've run up our credit cards, our national credit card to 1.5 quadrillion, according to many economists.
[02:12:14.102 --> 02:12:17.784]  And so now they want to have a new global tyrannical currency.
[02:12:17.784 --> 02:12:21.305]  You're saying for global trade there will be a world reserve currency.
[02:12:21.305 --> 02:12:25.327]  Let's make sure it's a free and fair one.
[02:12:25.327 --> 02:12:29.109]  So you're talking real world ball game here, not fantasy land.
[02:12:30.157 --> 02:12:32.639]  And then second of all, they'll come along later.
[02:12:32.639 --> 02:12:34.020]  How much later?
[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:34.600]  I don't know.
[02:12:34.600 --> 02:12:37.222]  And they'll say, well, gee, that worked really well.
[02:12:37.222 --> 02:12:39.243]  Now let's have a world currency.
[02:12:39.243 --> 02:12:42.366]  That's how I think they're going to slide into it.
[02:12:42.366 --> 02:12:45.408]  And I've been saying this for months, as you well know.
[02:12:45.408 --> 02:12:49.010]  And three months ago, you said that they would announce that Madoff had cancer.
[02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:51.472]  And now they've floated that out there.
[02:12:51.472 --> 02:12:52.493]  How did you know that was going to happen?
[02:12:53.915 --> 02:13:00.118]  Um, I had some information from other people, but I backed into it as well.
[02:13:00.118 --> 02:13:14.304]  The next thing is he'll have a heart attack, supposedly be taken out and buried, and probably end up at the hands of the plastic surgeon so he can go and live in Israel or Paraguay or wherever they're going to put him.
[02:13:14.304 --> 02:13:19.167]  Well, Ken Lay, I mean we know that was staged, that's even come out in foreign news.
[02:13:19.167 --> 02:13:20.307]  That's right.
[02:13:20.307 --> 02:13:21.648]  And then we have the
[02:13:22.475 --> 02:13:29.642]  The young man, Timothy McVeigh, who supposedly was executed, I have my doubts about that as well.
[02:13:29.642 --> 02:13:33.526]  Well, local reporters said he was breathing when they took him out.
[02:13:33.526 --> 02:13:35.268]  Well, there you go.
[02:13:35.268 --> 02:13:40.113]  And I think they take these people to other destinations and they live happily ever after.
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:53.488]  Now, when you were working in Black Ops against the Soviets, I mean, I've read even 50 years ago, they took large portions of special forces and would even stage their deaths, or change their names, give them plastic surgery, change their ears, their nose.
[02:13:53.488 --> 02:13:56.970]  That's declassified, so why wouldn't they do that with Madoff?
[02:13:56.970 --> 02:13:58.311]  Or Ken Lay?
[02:13:58.311 --> 02:14:02.613]  I mean, that's what they do in the Witness Protection Program, they stage the deaths a lot.
[02:14:02.613 --> 02:14:03.234]  That's right.
[02:14:03.234 --> 02:14:05.355]  And so, I think that's the way this has gone.
[02:14:05.355 --> 02:14:06.856]  They take care of their own.
[02:14:06.856 --> 02:14:07.936]  That's the way they do it.
[02:14:07.936 --> 02:14:10.418]  If you step out of line, you know, you get assassinated.
[02:14:11.209 --> 02:14:26.276]  But, you know, this program you've got coming up on Charlie Sheen, I knew Charlie when he lived in Malibu, and I'm very happy to see he has attained the intellectual abilities that he has.
[02:14:26.276 --> 02:14:33.839]  My kids grew up at the same time he did, and I knew his father quite well, Martin, because I used to go to church with him all the time.
[02:14:34.756 --> 02:14:46.902]  And so I'm very happy to see Charlie come out, and he was always a gutsy kid, always a little wild, and a great baseball player.
[02:14:46.902 --> 02:14:47.302]  Amazing.
[02:14:47.302 --> 02:14:50.944]  Well, I'll say hi to him when he's on with us.
[02:14:50.944 --> 02:14:52.385]  So much is going on.
[02:14:52.385 --> 02:14:54.666]  Obviously, you say get gold, get silver to protect yourself.
[02:14:56.058 --> 02:15:04.981]  Ted Anderson was on earlier, offering gold coins he bought at $9.45 in the market, in the current market, and silver, a dollar under what it is.
[02:15:04.981 --> 02:15:08.003]  Is that not an insanely good deal, Bob?
[02:15:08.003 --> 02:15:16.086]  It certainly is, and he continues to come up with these good investment deals, and we all should be proud of him.
[02:15:16.086 --> 02:15:21.708]  Sure, he's making money, but he's giving people great deals, and he should be thanked for that.
[02:15:22.808 --> 02:15:29.330]  Absolutely, and supporting this network, folks can call about that deal at 800-686-2237.
[02:15:29.330 --> 02:15:31.251]  800-686-2237.

[02:15:57.058 --> 02:15:57.339]  That's 877-479-8178.
[02:15:57.339 --> 02:16:00.841]  Alright, we've got about two or three minutes left here, Bob.
[02:16:00.841 --> 02:16:03.222]  In closing, what do you see happening in the fall?
[02:16:15.706 --> 02:16:21.072]  I see terrible things with the dollar going down to 71.18 on the USDX.
[02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:28.262]  I see great consternation and turmoil over the swine flu shots.
[02:16:28.262 --> 02:16:30.525]  The government, as you know, has been experimenting on our
[02:16:31.025 --> 02:16:31.325]  I think so.
[02:16:49.173 --> 02:16:51.554]  For the storm that they see coming ahead.
[02:16:51.554 --> 02:16:54.475]  His next speech is going to be about the economy.
[02:16:54.475 --> 02:16:56.535]  The economy is in dreadful shape.
[02:16:56.535 --> 02:16:59.376]  And it might, you know, go sideways for the next year.
[02:16:59.376 --> 02:17:04.217]  But if they don't add another $2 trillion or the banks don't start lending, it's over.
[02:17:04.217 --> 02:17:05.338]  So that's what they're going to do.
[02:17:05.338 --> 02:17:13.540]  You're going to see, and I predicted this last January, you're going to see them come up with another stimulus plan next year to make sure all these Democrats get back in office.
[02:17:14.295 --> 02:17:15.917]  Or I shouldn't say it that way.
[02:17:15.917 --> 02:17:19.321]  I should say everybody who's in office gets back in.
[02:17:19.321 --> 02:17:21.103]  That's what it's all about.
[02:17:21.103 --> 02:17:25.669]  And so I think that's what's going to happen.
[02:17:25.669 --> 02:17:26.710]  Well you're absolutely...
[02:17:28.746 --> 02:17:30.787]  Absolutely on target over and over again, Bob.
[02:17:30.787 --> 02:17:33.567]  We'll continue to watch this unfold.
[02:17:33.567 --> 02:17:39.189]  I think it's key that as the globalists implode the economy by design, we continue to say, audit the Fed.
[02:17:39.189 --> 02:17:41.650]  These are the people that engineered the collapse.
[02:17:41.650 --> 02:17:47.732]  These are the individuals creating a global Ponzi scheme that they want to panic us into the next phase of accepting world government.
[02:17:47.732 --> 02:17:51.673]  No, we must indict the bankers, as Ron Paul has said on this show.
[02:17:51.673 --> 02:17:53.373]  We must go after the globalists.
[02:17:53.373 --> 02:17:54.714]  We must bring them to justice.
[02:17:55.274 --> 02:18:04.323]  And just start identifying the shadow government and the deep state and the private offshore corporate criminal networks that are engaged in a global corporate takeover known as the New World Order.
[02:18:04.323 --> 02:18:20.497]  And if we just continue to hammer that in and get the word out, over 75% of Americans in a Gallup poll want to audit or abolish the Fed or both, so we're beginning to have more and more victories and people that wouldn't listen to us 10, 20, 30 years ago, 45 years ago when you first got started, they're now listening now.
[02:18:21.258 --> 02:18:24.279]  And it's all because of people like you, Bob Chapman, and all the fighters out there.
[02:18:24.279 --> 02:18:27.119]  So, everything you do, folks, is part of this incremental battle.
[02:18:27.119 --> 02:18:28.960]  Many hands make light work.
[02:18:28.960 --> 02:18:31.220]  Bob Chapman, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:32.881]  I want to do a full hour with you next week.
[02:18:32.881 --> 02:18:34.341]  Can you do that?
[02:18:34.341 --> 02:18:35.141]  Absolutely.
[02:18:35.141 --> 02:18:37.062]  And thank you for having me again.
[02:18:37.062 --> 02:18:38.562]  And we are winning.
[02:18:38.562 --> 02:18:40.162]  We've got them on the run.
[02:18:40.162 --> 02:18:43.683]  And gold over a thousand is a good example.
[02:18:43.683 --> 02:18:44.283]  Absolutely.
[02:18:44.283 --> 02:18:46.044]  God bless you, Bob Chapman.
[02:18:46.044 --> 02:18:46.684]  Same to you.
[02:18:46.684 --> 02:18:47.324]  Bye-bye.
[02:18:47.324 --> 02:18:48.004]  Take care, my friend.
[02:18:48.004 --> 02:18:50.345]  Bob, Jaren just popped in my ear, one of the producers.
[02:18:50.345 --> 02:18:50.605]  What's that?
[02:18:52.833 --> 02:18:56.554]  All right, at 19.50, I'm going to skip this network break.
[02:18:56.554 --> 02:18:59.835]  So stations will be carrying it because it's not their break.
[02:18:59.835 --> 02:19:03.315]  There's local breaks, network breaks, listeners always ask what I'm talking about when I say that.
[02:19:03.315 --> 02:19:09.377]  We're going to skip the 20 to 24 long break because I want to be able to play, to analyze it.
[02:19:09.377 --> 02:19:11.117]  It's bad audio, but it's the best we got.
[02:19:11.117 --> 02:19:18.579]  Somebody sent it to us, recorded off a radio, I guess, with like a tape recorder of Limbaugh with Mark Dice calling in just an hour or so ago.
[02:19:19.685 --> 02:19:29.953]  And we're going to play that, then we're going to go into the video, audio for listeners, of this incredible, mega-viral video Aaron Dykes produced that I shot the video of with Charlie Sheen.
[02:19:29.953 --> 02:19:33.837]  I'm very proud of this video that I directed, but that Aaron put together.
[02:19:33.837 --> 02:19:35.538]  He did Yeoman's work.
[02:19:35.538 --> 02:19:39.481]  And this is Charlie Sheen's video message to the President.
[02:19:39.481 --> 02:19:46.067]  So we're going to go ahead and go to Limbaugh, then to the message to the President from Charlie Sheen.
[02:19:46.067 --> 02:19:46.367]  Here it is.
[02:19:50.891 --> 02:19:52.355]  I love roller coasters.
[02:19:52.355 --> 02:19:53.678]  That's the Ohio Players.
[02:19:53.678 --> 02:19:54.239]  We're back.
[02:19:54.239 --> 02:19:56.124]  Rush Limbaugh here at EIV Network.
[02:19:56.124 --> 02:19:56.966]  Open line Friday.
[02:19:56.966 --> 02:19:58.069]  We're going to start on the phone.
[02:19:58.069 --> 02:19:58.670]  San Diego.
[02:19:59.635 --> 02:20:01.215]  Mark, thank you, sir, for calling.
[02:20:01.215 --> 02:20:02.596]  Nice to have you here with us.
[02:20:02.596 --> 02:20:03.196]  Thanks, Rush.
[02:20:03.196 --> 02:20:20.499]  I'm wondering what you and your establishment friends are going to do now that over one-third of Americans from both political parties believe that the attacks of 9-11 were an inside job, and your propaganda and your gatekeeping is not having the effect that you and your puppet masters thought it would.
[02:20:20.499 --> 02:20:22.559]  Well, you know something, Mark?
[02:20:22.559 --> 02:20:27.800]  What that tells me is that we're losing one-third of the country to a bunch of insane lunatics.
[02:20:28.994 --> 02:20:31.355]  And 9-11 was an inside job.
[02:20:31.355 --> 02:20:33.916]  I saw an interview, Mark, with Charlie Sheen.
[02:20:33.916 --> 02:20:36.137]  Charlie Sheen got 20 minutes with Barack Obama.
[02:20:36.137 --> 02:20:37.577]  I read the transcript.
[02:20:37.577 --> 02:20:39.718]  And Charlie Sheen said, hey, a prisoner's a prisoner.
[02:20:39.718 --> 02:20:41.539]  Don't you realize 9-11 was an inside job?
[02:20:41.539 --> 02:20:44.440]  And Obama didn't want to go there.
[02:20:44.440 --> 02:20:52.663]  If you can't get the leader of your kooks to go along with what you kooks believe, then I would say that you've got a kook cause.
[02:20:52.663 --> 02:20:53.984]  9-11, an inside job.
[02:20:57.953 --> 02:21:01.075]  I fear for a country because of such insanity.
[02:21:01.075 --> 02:21:04.578]  And I've talked about the fact that we're two or three countries today.
[02:21:04.578 --> 02:21:09.962]  And I have no illusion that I have any ability to reach the insane.
[02:21:09.962 --> 02:21:15.025]  I have no ability that I have any sway over lunatics.
[02:21:15.025 --> 02:21:18.207]  And frankly, I don't even try.
[02:21:18.207 --> 02:21:21.750]  What I'm trying to do is make sure that the number of lunatics
[02:21:22.742 --> 02:21:35.951]  The numbers of the genuinely politically insane remain as small as one-third, so that you will forever remain the stupid idiot minority that you are.
[02:21:35.951 --> 02:21:39.733]  You know something, folks?
[02:21:39.733 --> 02:21:46.118]  If George Bush were president today, let's say it's 2007, and it's the 6th anniversary of 9-11.
[02:21:47.407 --> 02:22:07.255]  And if George Bush were president, remember now the Iraq war still going on, coming up on the surge, and this training exercise had happened, do you think, and Bush was, let's say, everything's the same except Bush is president, he's at the Pentagon, he's doing a memorial at the Pentagon, and the Coast Guard runs his training exercise.
[02:22:09.991 --> 02:22:12.392]  Uh, you know what the drive-bys would report?
[02:22:12.392 --> 02:22:20.355]  That Bush faked and staged and purposely did this exercise to scare everybody to death, to realize we have real problems and to get everybody trying to support Iraq.
[02:22:20.355 --> 02:22:22.556]  They would say that Bush was behind it.
[02:22:22.556 --> 02:22:24.176]  You're lunatic friends, Mark.
[02:22:24.176 --> 02:22:25.877]  You're kook insaniacs.
[02:22:25.877 --> 02:22:28.398]  That would be your take on it.
[02:22:28.398 --> 02:22:29.298]  What do we get today?
[02:22:29.298 --> 02:22:30.278]  Oh no!
[02:22:30.278 --> 02:22:30.699]  Oh no!
[02:22:30.699 --> 02:22:31.839]  CNN!
[02:22:31.839 --> 02:22:32.139]  Oh no!
[02:22:32.139 --> 02:22:32.899]  The Infobank!
[02:22:32.899 --> 02:22:34.080]  The Obama thing!
[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:34.780]  The Obama thing!
[02:22:34.780 --> 02:22:35.360]  I hate it!
[02:22:38.257 --> 02:22:44.546]  The most embarrassing hour or two of reporting probably this week for CNN.
[02:22:44.546 --> 02:22:49.092]  I mean, you have to categorize CNN's embarrassments by the week.
[02:22:50.358 --> 02:22:52.521]  No warning signs and I'm aware of specific threats.
[02:23:11.788 --> 02:23:15.991]  70% of family members questions were never answered during the 9-11 Commission report.
[02:23:15.991 --> 02:23:18.633]  Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean said they were set up to fail.
[02:23:18.633 --> 02:23:20.034]  I mean, I'm a member of the Commission.
[02:23:20.034 --> 02:23:20.775]  It's a scam.
[02:23:20.775 --> 02:23:22.977]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[02:23:22.977 --> 02:23:25.558]  The questions, Mr. President.
[02:23:25.558 --> 02:23:28.761]  The questions.
[02:23:28.761 --> 02:23:33.604]  Building 7 ablaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse.
[02:23:33.604 --> 02:23:33.965]  Building 7.
[02:23:35.225 --> 02:23:38.447]  Well, no, there's number seven coming down.
[02:23:38.447 --> 02:23:46.553]  The excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being demolished, and they wired very carefully for days, and it's a very careful operation.
[02:23:46.553 --> 02:23:57.120]  For the third time today, in reminiscence of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[02:23:57.120 --> 02:24:00.303]  The smartest thing to do is pull it.
[02:24:00.303 --> 02:24:03.465]  And they made that decision to pull, and then we watched the building.
[02:24:04.125 --> 02:24:05.026]  Collapse.
[02:24:05.026 --> 02:24:08.990]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[02:24:08.990 --> 02:24:11.112]  Well, only really what you already know.
[02:24:11.112 --> 02:24:12.814]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[02:24:12.814 --> 02:24:24.705]  We are getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7, in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[02:24:24.705 --> 02:24:26.827]  The Pentagon.
[02:24:26.827 --> 02:24:27.608]  Vanishing airplane.
[02:24:28.183 --> 02:24:34.045]  My close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.
[02:24:34.045 --> 02:24:44.208]  The only sight is the actual side of the building that's crashed in, and as I said, the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand.
[02:24:44.208 --> 02:24:55.772]  There are no large tail sections, wing sections, a fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around, which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon.
[02:24:55.772 --> 02:24:56.892]  Firefighters and police
[02:24:58.001 --> 02:25:02.482]  You know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[02:25:27.622 --> 02:25:31.523]  To me it sounded like, to me it sounded like an explosion.
[02:25:31.523 --> 02:25:49.127]  Chief Albert Turry told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place, and then an hour after there was another explosion in one of the towers here.
[02:25:49.127 --> 02:25:53.108]  Sabel Edmonds, FBI translator, breaking her gag order.
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:57.861]  All our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban.
[02:25:57.861 --> 02:26:04.582]  We did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th.
[02:26:04.582 --> 02:26:10.283]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Rawapendi for kidney dialysis treatment.
[02:26:10.283 --> 02:26:11.763]  The military had him surrounded.
[02:26:11.763 --> 02:26:18.004]  They were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be watched carefully and looked after.
[02:26:18.004 --> 02:26:20.465]  NORAD standing down.
[02:26:20.465 --> 02:26:21.205]  Where were the planes?
[02:26:24.887 --> 02:26:27.949]  On now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11.
[02:26:27.949 --> 02:26:31.011]  A mysterious plane was seen flying right over the president's residence.
[02:26:31.011 --> 02:26:34.113]  The E-4Bs over New York and Washington.
[02:26:34.113 --> 02:26:36.275]  Otherwise known as the Doomsday Planes.
[02:26:36.275 --> 02:26:38.817]  It has never been officially explained.
[02:26:38.817 --> 02:26:43.780]  Cell phones working at impossible altitudes.
[02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:49.664]  Solicitor General Ted Olson receiving phone calls that the FBI says were never made.
[02:26:49.664 --> 02:26:50.845]  What happened during that call?
[02:26:50.845 --> 02:26:53.747]  This is the only information we have on these terrorists.
[02:26:55.936 --> 02:26:58.138]  She was able to call him twice.
[02:26:58.138 --> 02:27:02.161]  How she could pull that off, we don't know, but she did.
[02:27:02.161 --> 02:27:04.643]  These are the questions, Mr. President.
[02:27:04.643 --> 02:27:06.204]  These are the questions.
[02:27:06.204 --> 02:27:11.829]  They go on and on.
[02:27:11.829 --> 02:27:14.391]  Good afternoon, Mr. President.
[02:27:14.391 --> 02:27:22.957]  I come to you today representing the families of the victims of September 11th, as well as millions of my fellow Americans.
[02:27:22.957 --> 02:27:25.079]  Hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter
[02:27:26.774 --> 02:27:36.419]  We have questions, Mr. President.
[02:27:36.419 --> 02:27:37.219]  Lots of questions.
[02:27:37.219 --> 02:27:41.201]  A lot of them are detailed in my letter.
[02:27:41.201 --> 02:27:46.223]  But trust me, there are hundreds more questions.
[02:27:46.223 --> 02:27:53.266]  As my letter chronicles, sir, the 9-11 Commission itself says they were lied to, deceived, and
[02:27:54.130 --> 02:27:57.191]  essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation.
[02:27:57.191 --> 02:28:02.634]  The people of the United States and the world demand the truth, sir.
[02:28:02.634 --> 02:28:05.055]  We have to continuously ask questions.
[02:28:05.055 --> 02:28:06.035]  That's what a patriot does.
[02:28:06.035 --> 02:28:07.476]  That's what a true American does.
[02:28:07.476 --> 02:28:11.237]  We ask questions.
[02:28:11.237 --> 02:28:22.542]  You, sir, have the power, as well as the responsibility, to initiate a truly independent congressional investigation into the events of 9-11, as well as its aftermath.
[02:28:23.677 --> 02:28:25.919]  We want our country back, Mr. President.
[02:28:25.919 --> 02:28:33.666]  Therefore, I'm not just calling on you and your team, I'm calling on each and every American citizen to wake up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[02:28:33.666 --> 02:28:37.330]  We're counting on you, Mr. President.
[02:28:37.330 --> 02:28:38.211]  Be on the right side of history.
[02:28:58.149 --> 02:29:02.092]  Are you now saying that they weren't asking you to block an investigation?
[02:29:02.092 --> 02:29:09.198]  An investigation must not interfere with the ongoing efforts to prevent the next attack.
[02:29:09.198 --> 02:29:15.403]  Senator Tom Daschle said last week that you called him several times and urged him not to investigate the events of September 11th.
[02:29:15.403 --> 02:29:16.083]  Tom's wrong.
[02:29:16.083 --> 02:29:20.787]  He has, I think in this case, well, let's say a misinterpretation.
[02:29:22.560 --> 02:29:26.563]  The chickens are coming home to roost for the New World Order.
[02:29:26.563 --> 02:29:30.646]  Charlie Sheen's message to the President is being seen by tens of millions right now.
[02:29:30.646 --> 02:29:33.048]  Charlie Sheen coming up live.
[02:29:33.048 --> 02:29:35.050]  ABC, CNN, others have called.
[02:29:35.050 --> 02:29:38.853]  They're listening live to carry it later when he comes on with us.
[02:29:38.853 --> 02:29:42.035]  Charlie Sheen live on September 11, 2009.
[02:29:42.035 --> 02:29:44.817]  Eight years after the false flag terror attacks.
[02:29:44.817 --> 02:29:47.119]  With big announcements and challenges.
[02:29:47.119 --> 02:29:48.980]  This is going to be extremely powerful.
[02:29:48.980 --> 02:29:49.501]  Stay with us.
[02:29:51.846 --> 02:29:53.227]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.227 --> 02:29:55.768]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.768 --> 02:30:00.731]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.731 --> 02:30:06.034]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:30:06.034 --> 02:30:10.557]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:30:10.557 --> 02:30:12.838]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:30:12.838 --> 02:30:14.459]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:30:14.459 --> 02:30:15.500]  There is a solution.
[02:30:15.720 --> 02:30:24.164]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:31:31.055 --> 02:31:31.675]  We're good.
[02:32:03.709 --> 02:32:06.771]  Comfort food is the food you turn to when you've had a bad day.
[02:32:06.771 --> 02:32:09.073]  It's also the first thing you want when it's time to celebrate.

[02:33:14.085 --> 02:33:21.690]  It is September 11, 2009, eight years after the tragic events that hit New York and Washington, D.C.
[02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:23.491]  Operation Northwoods, the official U.S.
[02:33:23.491 --> 02:33:25.252]  government plan to stage terror attacks in U.S.
[02:33:25.252 --> 02:33:29.675]  cities to start a foreign war with Cuba and the Soviets.
[02:33:29.675 --> 02:33:33.938]  Operation Ajax, staging terror attacks in Iran to blame it on their government, declassified.
[02:33:33.938 --> 02:33:39.582]  Gulf of Tonkin, admittedly staged to get us into the Vietnam War that killed over a million Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans.
[02:33:41.448 --> 02:33:43.591]  False flag terror is real.
[02:33:43.591 --> 02:33:51.481]  But Charlie Sheen of Platoon and Wall Street and Major League and of course the number one top paid TV star
[02:33:52.796 --> 02:33:58.097]  Charlie Sheen is simply asking questions, and he's with us now into the bottom of the next hour.
[02:33:58.097 --> 02:34:07.058]  For a full hour today, Bob McIlvain, who lost his son in the towers, will be joining us coming up later in the next hour of the last 15 minutes of this interview.
[02:34:07.058 --> 02:34:10.919]  Joining us from his home in Los Angeles is Charlie Sheen.
[02:34:10.919 --> 02:34:12.559]  Charlie, thanks for being with us.
[02:34:12.559 --> 02:34:13.640]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:16.600]  It's great to be here, as usual.
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:21.381]  I think right off the top, we need to take a moment of silence.
[02:34:21.889 --> 02:34:27.254]  A lot of people lost their lives, a lot of people lost loved ones on that day and it is important to remember them.
[02:34:45.327 --> 02:34:56.772]  Charlie, political whores like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity and others, their attack plan is to say that you're besmirching the memory of those that died.
[02:34:56.772 --> 02:35:02.314]  When I've interviewed Bill Doyle, the head of the Biggest Families group, saying the majority of them believe it's an inside job.
[02:35:02.314 --> 02:35:03.035]  He does.
[02:35:03.035 --> 02:35:06.256]  Bob McIlvain, they've protested around the White House and Ground Zero.
[02:35:06.256 --> 02:35:08.217]  The media ignores them.
[02:35:08.217 --> 02:35:10.378]  Your letter and your request
[02:35:11.278 --> 02:35:18.144]  Has been about having a meeting with the President and taking these victims' family members there to the White House.
[02:35:18.144 --> 02:35:26.370]  But the media is involved in this hoax, saying the family is all by the official story, when six of the ten Commission members say it's a complete fraud.
[02:35:26.370 --> 02:35:31.895]  Yeah, no, well I guess it's, you know, this is indicative of the times that we live in.
[02:35:31.895 --> 02:35:36.779]  If people don't hear it on television, then it must not be true.
[02:35:36.779 --> 02:35:39.701]  You know, which is a sad state of affairs.
[02:35:41.670 --> 02:36:10.452]  You know, I think we should talk about the fact that I reached out to the White House, that I sent an email to Press Secretary Gibbs, and I got a call back from his deputy, Mr. Burton, and he said, out of respect to him, I don't believe in playing people's voice messages, you know, airing them publicly, but he said that he would get back to me, but he doesn't feel that this thing is going to happen, meaning
[02:36:10.959 --> 02:36:13.821]  My actual sit-down with the President.
[02:36:13.821 --> 02:36:33.454]  And so, I wrote them again, and I said, you know, I asked if I could, you know, as an ambassador to the families, meet with the President with Bob McElveen, in particular, representing their voice.
[02:36:33.454 --> 02:36:36.656]  I haven't heard back yet, but I did in my email state that
[02:36:37.702 --> 02:36:52.091]  If the President denies this request, I would at the very least expect a letter with him detailing his decision to not do so.
[02:36:52.091 --> 02:36:57.035]  Still waiting to hear back.
[02:36:57.035 --> 02:36:58.596]  I understand they've got their hands full.
[02:36:58.596 --> 02:37:04.800]  There's a lot of issues that they're tackling, but I don't really think that they're any more important than what we're trying to address here.
[02:37:06.277 --> 02:37:08.118]  Yeah, they're busy staging events.
[02:37:08.118 --> 02:37:13.460]  It turned out the White House had ordered the New York police not to tell the mayor about the flyby.
[02:37:13.460 --> 02:37:16.602]  Air Force One photo-op triggers panic in Manhattan.
[02:37:16.602 --> 02:37:19.843]  Turned out the White House ran that to create some type of psy-op.
[02:37:19.843 --> 02:37:34.830]  Now you have this drill run by the Coast Guard with the media covering it like it's real, just a mile from where he's giving a speech, but he has now lovingly reassured us that everything's okay, but reminded us of how wicked the cave dwellers are and how we better give up all our rights or they'll get us.
[02:37:36.027 --> 02:37:41.553]  Yeah, yeah, I know, because these guys in a cave in Afghanistan with a satellite phone can get NORAD to stand down.
[02:37:41.553 --> 02:37:43.295]  Wow.
[02:37:43.295 --> 02:37:45.718]  They're more powerful than we ever imagined.
[02:37:45.718 --> 02:37:50.783]  As far as that flyby, didn't any of these clowns ever heard of Photoshop?
[02:37:50.783 --> 02:37:52.225]  I don't know.
[02:37:52.225 --> 02:37:56.490]  Call me crazy, it just seemed a much easier and cheaper solution, you know?
[02:37:56.903 --> 02:37:58.764]  Well, it turned out it wasn't a photo-op.
[02:37:58.764 --> 02:38:00.444]  There was a psy-op the White House ran.
[02:38:00.444 --> 02:38:03.905]  And that's hidden in plain view, and that's clearly what's happening here.
[02:38:03.905 --> 02:38:07.747]  But yeah, they could have gotten a photo-op for Air Force One over New York.
[02:38:07.747 --> 02:38:09.527]  Give me a break.
[02:38:09.527 --> 02:38:13.128]  Let's talk about that media spin.
[02:38:13.128 --> 02:38:15.569]  You wrote the letter so they would focus on the 20 points.
[02:38:15.569 --> 02:38:23.872]  Talk about that, and then please expand on the fact that they continue to put words in your mouth and misrepresent what you're saying.
[02:38:24.997 --> 02:38:29.739]  Well, yeah, I mean, but I anticipated this.
[02:38:29.739 --> 02:38:35.622]  I didn't know that it would be this egregious, that it would be this blatant.
[02:38:35.622 --> 02:38:40.123]  You know, I wrote the letter to get people's attention.
[02:38:40.123 --> 02:38:41.784]  Oh my God, did this really happen?
[02:38:41.784 --> 02:38:45.006]  And then, bang, there's all the data.
[02:38:45.006 --> 02:38:51.068]  And so I think it had the effect that I had hoped for, and even more so.
[02:38:51.068 --> 02:38:52.569]  But the media right now is really...
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:59.764]  Really showing their ignorance as well as their true colors.
[02:38:59.764 --> 02:39:21.098]  Because I haven't read one hit piece, one article, online or otherwise, that after attacking me personally, they then never go on to say, well we've looked at your 20 bullet points and here's why they're completely invalid and based in fiction.
[02:39:23.746 --> 02:39:30.669]  I think that we put something out there that is so powerful that they can't figure out a way to disassemble it this time.
[02:39:30.669 --> 02:39:49.976]  They're doing all their research, and they're looking in all their archives, and rather than, you know, rolling out some experts or, you know, really looking at the facts and saying, well, this is questionable or that's questionable, we've really tied their hands, so all they can do is attack me personally.
[02:39:53.892 --> 02:39:54.872]  It's sad.
[02:39:54.872 --> 02:39:55.353]  It's sad.
[02:39:55.353 --> 02:39:57.974]  I mean, I actually kind of feel bad for these people.
[02:39:57.974 --> 02:39:58.815]  That's all they got?
[02:39:58.815 --> 02:40:01.117]  Like, oh, he did this, this, and this.
[02:40:01.117 --> 02:40:02.097]  Okay, all right.
[02:40:02.097 --> 02:40:02.958]  Keep going.
[02:40:02.958 --> 02:40:03.638]  Yeah, I did that.
[02:40:03.638 --> 02:40:04.019]  Okay.
[02:40:04.019 --> 02:40:04.679]  Might have done that.
[02:40:04.679 --> 02:40:05.620]  Whatever.
[02:40:05.620 --> 02:40:06.480]  Let's get to the fact.
[02:40:06.480 --> 02:40:09.603]  And they just don't get there.
[02:40:09.603 --> 02:40:16.087]  But I think what we need to mention, Alex, is that we need to really thank all the readers that have commented, that have
[02:40:23.513 --> 02:40:39.744]  He really supported me in the comment sections on a lot of these articles because they themselves point out that it is clearly obvious, Mr. or Mrs. whoever, that you did not read his piece.
[02:40:39.744 --> 02:40:41.325]  You did not address any of this.
[02:40:41.325 --> 02:40:45.167]  All you're doing is attacking him personally.
[02:40:45.167 --> 02:40:47.949]  It's just so predictable and completely inane.
[02:40:48.325 --> 02:40:57.759]  Well, Charlie Sheen, TakeMilitary.com, dozens of comments, I only saw two that were against you and they were mindless and sophomoric.
[02:40:57.759 --> 02:41:01.105]  The other comments, even though the story was a hit piece, said, look,
[02:41:02.293 --> 02:41:09.637]  His article does have a link to the Washington Post with six of the ten commission members saying it's a cover-up, a lie.
[02:41:09.637 --> 02:41:14.640]  There needs to be a criminal investigation of the Pentagon and the White House.
[02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:19.563]  And when I talked to you last night, you wanted to specifically get into that.
[02:41:19.563 --> 02:41:28.327]  We will later, but first off, what about Cheney and the false flag stuff that came out from Cy Hirsch and even MSNBC?
[02:41:28.327 --> 02:41:29.148]  Tell folks about that.
[02:41:29.929 --> 02:41:56.178]  I think people need to really, really look at the connection, look at the reality between the fact that this is the same man that concocted this outrageous plan, as reported by Seymour Hersh, which is detailed in the letter, for a false United States provocation to bring us into the Iranian conflict.
[02:41:56.178 --> 02:41:59.459]  And so people really need to look at that, and really need to
[02:42:00.020 --> 02:42:21.786]  To look at the outline of the measure of this insanity, and then also take note that this is the same guy who violated or usurped a 51-year standing protocol to seize shoot-down power from the generals at NORAD.
[02:42:21.786 --> 02:42:28.268]  So the guy that came up with the insane Spirit of Hormuz plan is the guy on 9-11
[02:42:29.540 --> 02:42:34.066]  The only guy in the known universe would shoot down power.
[02:42:34.066 --> 02:42:37.229]  And nobody's talking about that.
[02:42:37.229 --> 02:42:41.975]  Everybody's talking about, you know, my past exploits.
[02:42:41.975 --> 02:42:44.999]  So on and so forth, so I don't have any credibility.
[02:42:45.558 --> 02:42:50.219]  They're just jealous as if the Pentagon boys don't have any exploits.
[02:42:50.219 --> 02:42:53.760]  Hookers are more ubiquitous than water fountains in D.C.
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:54.360]  Bill Clinton.
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:43:12.945]  But the point is, expanding on this, sir, and not what you did when you were 25, expanding on this, it's Dick Cheney that wrote the PNAC document September 20, 2000, saying we need a big Pearl Harbor event, a big terror attack, a catalyzing event to launch our global domination.
[02:43:13.755 --> 02:43:26.447]  Yes, which people will notice that's observed through the voice of the President in my piece and not by myself, which I think was key.
[02:43:28.499 --> 02:43:30.300]  Tell folks why you had the idea.
[02:43:30.300 --> 02:43:32.662]  This was all your idea, and I think it was genius.
[02:43:32.662 --> 02:43:34.283]  Brilliant, as many have said.
[02:43:34.283 --> 02:43:42.909]  Looking at the piece, different literature sites, Hollywood sites, even some that disagree with you are looking at it and saying this is a really well-written, 16-page script.
[02:43:42.909 --> 02:43:47.352]  How did you get the idea to have it 20 minutes with the President, and then put it out the way we did?
[02:43:47.352 --> 02:43:53.056]  Well, gosh, there were a couple of factors.
[02:43:53.056 --> 02:43:55.397]  There was a piece written by Aaron Sorkin.
[02:43:55.397 --> 02:43:56.959]  I believe it was in the Washington Post.
[02:43:58.419 --> 02:44:27.769]  over a year ago and uh... and it was a fictional meeting between uh... obama and my father's character uh... president barlett the west wing and uh... obama goes to him after dad's out of office and uh... and ask for advice term uh... etc and so uh... i thought it was interesting i thought it was i thought it was fun and i thought it was cute and really well written and then uh... uh...
[02:44:28.490 --> 02:44:36.616]  A few months ago, I just woke up with the title in my head, 20 Minutes with the President, and I just started thinking, what is this about?
[02:44:36.616 --> 02:44:38.418]  What is this?
[02:44:38.418 --> 02:44:47.505]  And I started formulating this image of President Obama and myself sitting down and having a discussion.
[02:44:47.505 --> 02:44:49.106]  And I thought, well, what's the discussion about?
[02:44:49.106 --> 02:44:50.487]  What am I really passionate about?
[02:44:50.487 --> 02:44:53.990]  And the discussion's about 9-11 and about a new investigation.
[02:44:56.192 --> 02:45:03.839]  And then I got into it, and I lost focus, I lost momentum, I kind of lost my passion for the piece.
[02:45:03.839 --> 02:45:10.244]  And I watched a documentary called Press for Truth.
[02:45:10.244 --> 02:45:12.546]  It was about the Jersey Girls and the Family Steering Committee.
[02:45:12.546 --> 02:45:21.494]  And there was a gentleman I interviewed in there, Bob McElbane, and I just found something
[02:45:23.752 --> 02:45:25.773]  So powerful about his message.
[02:45:25.773 --> 02:45:38.759]  So completely disarming and really poignant to all of these feelings that I had and all these thoughts I had about the peace.
[02:45:38.759 --> 02:45:52.465]  And so I discovered my motivation in that moment because I thought to myself, if this gentleman, if this man who is living a life of this much sorrow can wake up one day and just
[02:45:53.450 --> 02:46:03.263]  Just for that day, feel a little bit better about the state of things because of the work that I've done, because of the voice that I've utilized to bring attention to this.
[02:46:03.263 --> 02:46:07.409]  If I can do that for him, just one guy, then I've done something good.
[02:46:07.409 --> 02:46:09.993]  I've done something that matters.
[02:46:10.871 --> 02:46:12.654]  And of course, that's beautiful, Charlie.
[02:46:12.654 --> 02:46:18.123]  Bob lost his son and he's now raising their grandson with he and his wife.
[02:46:18.123 --> 02:46:20.346]  He's going to be on with us later in the next hour.
[02:46:20.346 --> 02:46:25.755]  To paraphrase what you told me when you called me and said you wanted me to come out and work with you on this piece, I was very honored.
[02:46:27.298 --> 02:46:28.899]  Yeah, but I think, you know, Alex, people need to know
[02:46:56.579 --> 02:47:10.361]  How integral you were to this process, that I called on you as my research expert, as my point man on that front, to really help me make this thing bulletproof.
[02:47:10.361 --> 02:47:22.263]  If you look at what you brought to it, and what we've done together, I think it really speaks to the fact that they can't, as I said earlier, disassemble this thing.
[02:47:22.263 --> 02:47:24.324]  Because it's bulletproof.
[02:47:26.482 --> 02:47:34.608]  It's rooted in fact that we have collected from all of the mainstream arms of media.
[02:47:34.608 --> 02:47:41.692]  And so that's what's pissing them off right now is that we're using all the stuff that they publish and now they can't refute it, you know?
[02:47:42.509 --> 02:47:56.360]  And it's ridiculous that Limbaugh, when it's all over the news in hundreds of papers, first line in the Times of London, LA Times, everywhere, that it was a mock letter of the points you'd like to bring to him.
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:48:03.125]  Kind of a vehicle to publicly give Obama the data and there's no doubt the White House has read it and seen it, you've talked to them.
[02:48:03.125 --> 02:48:08.169]  Now, moving on here, I want to later get back into the next phase with the White House
[02:48:09.588 --> 02:48:19.853]  A declaration of arms in the peaceful info war to stand up for 9-11 truth and demand a new congressional truly independent commission, but specifically talking about media.
[02:48:19.853 --> 02:48:21.714]  Sure.
[02:48:21.714 --> 02:48:27.556]  There was one particular show, The View, and you've got a challenge for somebody.
[02:48:27.556 --> 02:48:30.618]  Yes, I do, Alex.
[02:48:30.618 --> 02:48:34.139]  Meghan McCain, John McCain's daughter, I guess, was on The View.
[02:48:34.139 --> 02:48:37.001]  I don't watch the shows, but I only read the transcript.
[02:48:38.888 --> 02:48:48.512]  She had some pretty, uh, gosh, um, uneducated, uh, uninformed comments about my piece, uh, or about me personally.
[02:48:48.512 --> 02:48:49.973]  She wasn't even talking about the piece.
[02:48:49.973 --> 02:48:59.697]  Um, I just got to believe, Alec, that, uh, if, that if I was sitting right next to her, that her, her, her tune would have been, uh, would have been a lot different.
[02:48:59.697 --> 02:49:08.021]  Um, but if she's such an expert on, on, on me, first of all, and, and, and, and on,
[02:49:08.931 --> 02:49:15.238]  On the event, secondly, I would welcome her to an open debate.
[02:49:15.238 --> 02:49:17.821]  Just take the time and the place, and I'll be there early.
[02:49:17.821 --> 02:49:21.606]  She better pack her lunch, because it's going to take some time.
[02:49:21.606 --> 02:49:29.194]  And specifically, when we come back after this quick break, we'll detail it, because there's a whole backstory with CNN and Larry King Live going on.
[02:49:30.109 --> 02:49:40.935]  And what's happening there, and so officially, in your own words, you are challenging Meghan McCain to a debate on Larry King Live next week.
[02:49:40.935 --> 02:49:44.957]  Well, Larry King wouldn't schedule the piece because they couldn't find somebody to represent the other side.
[02:49:44.957 --> 02:49:51.560]  So now that Meghan McCain has come out as an expert on me, and on September 11th, yeah, no, let's invite her out there.
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:52.460]  Let's see what she's got.
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:53.381]  Because I'm coming out there.
[02:49:53.381 --> 02:49:54.501]  I'm coming out there with my letter.
[02:49:54.501 --> 02:49:55.482]  I'm coming out there with the facts.
[02:49:55.482 --> 02:49:56.822]  I'm coming out there with the truth.
[02:49:56.822 --> 02:49:58.323]  I don't know what she's coming out there with.
[02:49:58.323 --> 02:49:59.344]  Maybe she's promoting the book.
[02:49:59.344 --> 02:49:59.664]  I don't know.
[02:50:01.631 --> 02:50:05.383]  But this is a lot more important than Pulp Fiction.
[02:50:06.118 --> 02:50:11.663]  And you want to bring Bob McIlvain and she can bring the Stooges from Popper Mechanics if she wants.
[02:50:11.663 --> 02:50:18.168]  The problem is, Popper Mechanics, CNN told me in a separate deal, they wanted to have me on a couple years ago on Popper Mechanics.
[02:50:18.168 --> 02:50:19.589]  Popper Mechanics won't do it.
[02:50:19.589 --> 02:50:21.711]  They won't debate anybody from Loose Change.
[02:50:21.711 --> 02:50:23.312]  They have to have it all to themselves.
[02:50:23.312 --> 02:50:25.915]  These cowards are called out.
[02:50:25.915 --> 02:50:31.379]  They need to come debate you with Meghan McCain next week on Larry King Live.
[02:50:31.379 --> 02:50:32.820]  She can bring her dad.
[02:50:32.820 --> 02:50:33.381]  She can bring
[02:50:34.354 --> 02:50:40.895]  The ex-Vice President, she can bring whatever she wants, but as I said, you know, don't bring in the truth.
[02:50:42.927 --> 02:50:45.328]  Do you have trouble getting through the day?
[02:50:45.328 --> 02:50:46.409]  Do you feel tired and worn out?
[02:51:06.440 --> 02:51:08.262]  Pounding expensive energy drinks?
[02:51:08.262 --> 02:51:13.167]  It's a proven fact many people do not get the proper daily intake of essential vitamins and nutrients.

[02:54:16.560 --> 02:54:22.163]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.

[02:54:38.747 --> 02:54:42.928]  Bob McIlvain coming up in about 15 minutes.
[02:54:42.928 --> 02:54:45.390]  Charlie Sheen, stay with us into the next hour.
[02:54:45.390 --> 02:54:48.651]  Charlie, specifically, I was talking to you during the break.
[02:54:48.651 --> 02:54:49.832]  You want to issue the challenge.
[02:54:49.832 --> 02:54:51.812]  Go ahead.
[02:54:51.812 --> 02:54:53.013]  Let's do it.
[02:54:53.013 --> 02:55:00.656]  I issue the challenge to debate Meghan McCain, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly.
[02:55:00.656 --> 02:55:01.097]  Bring them all.
[02:55:02.270 --> 02:55:05.873]  Bob McIlwain and I will join you on Larry King Live.
[02:55:05.873 --> 02:55:07.635]  And you guys bring whatever you got.
[02:55:07.635 --> 02:55:09.416]  Bring popular mechanics.
[02:55:09.416 --> 02:55:11.298]  Let's call them out as well.
[02:55:11.298 --> 02:55:12.599]  And we'll show up with the truth.
[02:55:12.599 --> 02:55:14.941]  We'll just see how it goes.
[02:55:14.941 --> 02:55:16.322]  We're not hiding.
[02:55:16.322 --> 02:55:16.823]  We're not hiding.
[02:55:20.458 --> 02:55:29.302]  Charlie Limbaugh, even though every news article said it was a mock letter to give your information to Obama to get his attention, every article out there says it was a mock letter.
[02:55:29.302 --> 02:55:36.066]  Limbaugh said it was real today and said Obama really met with you and called him the head truther.
[02:55:36.066 --> 02:55:37.787]  Interesting.
[02:55:37.787 --> 02:55:39.628]  Interesting.
[02:55:39.628 --> 02:55:49.513]  Yeah, that seems a little irresponsible for a guy that, you know, that's his job to research the news that he's reporting.
[02:55:49.513 --> 02:55:50.033]  One would think.
[02:55:50.951 --> 02:55:54.193]  That was the old description, I guess.
[02:55:54.193 --> 02:56:07.380]  Yeah, but again, again, I think it's, um, you know, with those hit pieces, with the pinhead stuff, and whatever else, I didn't, you know, I was told about it, um, uh, it's just a, it's the classic, uh, bullying syndrome.
[02:56:07.380 --> 02:56:15.445]  You know, it's, it's, you know, they'll, they'll, oftentimes you'll, you'll, you'll discover that the bully is really the most scared kid on the playground.
[02:56:15.445 --> 02:56:19.007]  Doesn't reveal that until he's confronted, you know, and these people are going to keep
[02:56:19.451 --> 02:56:20.812]  You're throwing down the gauntlet.
[02:56:41.035 --> 02:56:45.058]  Yeah, we were having a discussion at your house, and we were both on the same page.
[02:56:45.058 --> 02:56:51.702]  I mean, I wake up sometimes in the middle of the night just thinking, my God, if they lied about 9-11, everything else is a lie.
[02:56:51.702 --> 02:56:56.025]  They've been caught lying about WMDs and Yellow Cake and everything else.
[02:56:56.025 --> 02:56:59.147]  I mean, how can we just let them sweep this under the rug of history?
[02:56:59.147 --> 02:57:02.930]  In fact, you have a line in your letter dealing with that.
[02:57:02.930 --> 02:57:03.851]  Yeah, I do.
[02:57:03.851 --> 02:57:04.091]  I do.
[02:57:06.297 --> 02:57:19.021]  You know, they create the party line, they say it over and over, as I talk about in the piece, the media mantras, you know, of disrespecting the memories of the victims.
[02:57:19.021 --> 02:57:24.303]  You know, it's again, like I said earlier, if it's on television, it must be true.
[02:57:24.303 --> 02:57:25.403]  You know?
[02:57:25.403 --> 02:57:28.364]  We've got to get people to smash that paradigm.
[02:57:28.364 --> 02:57:32.766]  We've got to get them to start pulling back the curtain and start calling these people out.
[02:57:32.766 --> 02:57:33.486]  Start saying, no!
[02:57:34.269 --> 02:57:35.550]  No, this is not how we feel.
[02:57:35.550 --> 02:57:36.730]  This is not what we believe.
[02:57:36.730 --> 02:57:38.891]  This is not our stance.
[02:57:38.891 --> 02:57:40.352]  Stop misrepresenting us.
[02:57:40.352 --> 02:57:45.375]  Stop telling us, for eight years now, what the truth is about how we feel.
[02:57:47.659 --> 02:58:08.892]  Well, the majority of the victim's families, and if the media listening wants me to give them their names, and the majority of the families, what, in polls over 70% that were asked said they didn't like the commission and thought it was a lie, and 6 of the 10 commission members and 2 of their council members, so a total of 8, say it's a complete fraud and a lie, and that there should be criminal investigations of the White House and Pentagon.
[02:58:08.892 --> 02:58:14.976]  I mean, this is in the Washington Post and Associated Press, and we're bad because we're going, hey, the commission says it's a lie?
[02:58:16.075 --> 02:58:24.459]  Yeah, I think that's another part of this whole media spin machine, is that they're now, you know, day two, day three, day four into this thing.
[02:58:24.459 --> 02:58:37.406]  They're taking everything that I have illustrated in the bullet points, and they're putting these as words, thoughts, opinions, theories, from my mouth.
[02:58:37.406 --> 02:58:38.366]  Stay there!
[02:58:38.366 --> 02:58:39.747]  Gotta break, Charlie Sheen.
[02:58:39.747 --> 02:58:41.568]  Stay with us, back in one minute.
[02:58:41.568 --> 02:58:45.930]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a
[02:58:51.417 --> 02:58:54.439]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.439 --> 02:58:59.762]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:58:59.762 --> 02:59:01.823]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:01.823 --> 02:59:06.825]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:06.825 --> 02:59:08.006]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.006 --> 02:59:09.126]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.126 --> 02:59:11.007]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.007 --> 02:59:12.088]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.088 --> 02:59:14.109]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.309 --> 02:59:15.610]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:15.610 --> 02:59:17.151]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.151 --> 02:59:22.414]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.414 --> 02:59:25.996]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:25.996 --> 02:59:29.458]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:29.818 --> 02:59:31.038]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.038 --> 02:59:31.938]  We don't know.
[02:59:31.938 --> 02:59:33.039]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.039 --> 02:59:33.979]  All you can get.
[02:59:33.979 --> 02:59:35.079]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.079 --> 02:59:38.120]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.120 --> 02:59:38.640]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.640 --> 02:59:40.320]  Or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:40.320 --> 02:59:41.320]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:42.501]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:42.501 --> 02:59:44.361]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:09.304 --> 03:00:12.645]  It's one of the biggest stories out there right now.
[03:00:12.645 --> 03:00:13.685]  We have retaken 9-11.
[03:00:13.685 --> 03:00:21.987]  The establishment's tried to put out a distorted view of history when their story's always changed.
[03:00:21.987 --> 03:00:25.969]  Our questions are unchanging and must be answered.
[03:00:25.969 --> 03:00:31.150]  It is a fact that six of the ten commissioners say it's a fraud from the 9-11 Commission itself, appointed by Bush.
[03:00:32.301 --> 03:00:34.142]  We demand a new congressional investigation.
[03:00:34.142 --> 03:00:36.343]  Charlie, you got cut off by the break there.
[03:00:36.343 --> 03:00:40.565]  Finish up the point you were making about how the media will never focus on what you said.
[03:00:40.565 --> 03:00:42.826]  They always distort what you're saying.
[03:00:42.826 --> 03:00:49.788]  Yeah, and then they're putting, you know, words in my mouth that these are my opinions, my theories, these are my beliefs.
[03:00:49.788 --> 03:00:57.692]  And when in fact it's just, you know, it's their drawing from the bullet points and turning them into
[03:00:58.453 --> 03:01:12.760]  My words, and they're now saying that, you know, that I said that the CIA was working with Bin Laden, and blah blah blah, and so on and so forth, and they're ignoring the fact that that was Sabel Edmonds, FBI translator, who just broke her, her gag order, you know?
[03:01:12.760 --> 03:01:25.247]  And they're saying that, uh, that I'm insisting this was an inside job orchestrated by the Bush Cabal, and so on and so forth, when in fact I'm just pointing out that, uh, you know, that to look at these glaring inconsistencies
[03:01:26.377 --> 03:01:27.317]  Alex, let's face it.
[03:01:27.317 --> 03:01:33.700]  How many points did you and I go through to come down to bring it down to 20?
[03:01:33.700 --> 03:01:36.641]  Probably 300.
[03:01:36.641 --> 03:01:40.082]  Should we reveal why it's 20, Alex?
[03:01:40.082 --> 03:01:41.823]  Nobody's picked up on this, have they?
[03:01:41.823 --> 03:01:42.083]  It's 20-20.
[03:01:42.083 --> 03:01:42.743]  It's 20 minutes.
[03:01:42.743 --> 03:01:43.203]  It's 20 points.
[03:01:43.203 --> 03:01:43.824]  20-20 vision.
[03:01:43.824 --> 03:01:44.224]  What's 9 plus 11?
[03:01:48.865 --> 03:01:49.606]  Yeah.
[03:01:49.606 --> 03:01:51.590]  Ooh, Charlie Sheen, the numerologist, ooh!
[03:01:51.590 --> 03:01:53.413]  I can hear it now.
[03:01:53.413 --> 03:01:55.336]  No, but it's the establishment that's obsessed with that.
[03:01:55.336 --> 03:01:57.300]  I mean, look.
[03:01:58.581 --> 03:02:04.746]  We have a White House that day one said Iraq did it and it turned out they knew Iraq wasn't involved.
[03:02:04.746 --> 03:02:07.428]  Even if you believe the official story, they premeditatedly.
[03:02:07.428 --> 03:02:10.450]  That came out in the White House memo and the Downing Street memos.
[03:02:10.450 --> 03:02:12.191]  That's mainstream British news.
[03:02:12.191 --> 03:02:17.355]  The White House confirmed that they wanted to shoot down US aircraft or get them shot down to blame it on Saddam.
[03:02:17.355 --> 03:02:18.756]  That they knew Saddam wasn't involved.
[03:02:18.756 --> 03:02:20.978]  They knew he didn't have yellow cake or nuclear bombs.
[03:02:20.978 --> 03:02:22.319]  They knew he didn't have weapons systems.
[03:02:22.959 --> 03:02:25.842]  And they persecuted the inspectors that told the truth.
[03:02:25.842 --> 03:02:30.366]  And so if they'll lie about WMDs and go kill over a million Iraqis and 5,000 U.S.
[03:02:30.366 --> 03:02:34.490]  troops, what else will they do?
[03:02:34.490 --> 03:02:37.452]  I mean, you tell me.
[03:02:37.452 --> 03:02:41.416]  It seems like their record is a little tarnished going in.
[03:02:42.568 --> 03:02:43.788]  A little bit tarnished.
[03:02:43.788 --> 03:02:48.590]  Well, even MSNBC and Sy Hersh reported that Cheney wanted to paint up U.S.
[03:02:48.590 --> 03:02:51.411]  ships like Iranian ships and have them attack our destroyers.
[03:02:51.411 --> 03:02:52.392]  Exactly.
[03:02:52.392 --> 03:02:53.032]  Exactly.
[03:02:53.032 --> 03:02:59.034]  And as we discussed earlier, this is the same guy that was the only person alive that had shoot-down authority.
[03:02:59.034 --> 03:03:01.855]  Had the authority to call for sorties on the hijacked airliners.
[03:03:01.855 --> 03:03:04.316]  So, let's talk about that.
[03:03:04.316 --> 03:03:06.097]  Talk about that, Sean Hannity.
[03:03:06.097 --> 03:03:07.317]  Talk about that, Bill O'Reilly.
[03:03:07.317 --> 03:03:08.418]  Talk about that, Rushford.
[03:03:08.418 --> 03:03:09.678]  Talk about that, Meghan McCain.
[03:03:09.678 --> 03:03:10.638]  Just talk about it.
[03:03:10.638 --> 03:03:11.819]  Just talk about it.
[03:03:12.728 --> 03:03:16.393]  Let's just discuss it.
[03:03:16.393 --> 03:03:19.997]  I guess we... I would love to hear their thoughts about that.
[03:03:19.997 --> 03:03:31.251]  Because if, you know, unless they're going to spend the entire time criticizing me and the things they think I've done or have done, then, you know, let's talk about what's really going on.
[03:03:35.649 --> 03:03:39.671]  Charlie, there's no doubt that you are risking a lot doing this.
[03:03:39.671 --> 03:03:41.391]  There's no doubt we're risking our lives doing this.
[03:03:41.391 --> 03:03:43.152]  These are murderers.
[03:03:43.152 --> 03:03:45.753]  Some of these people that run these dark systems.
[03:03:45.753 --> 03:03:50.055]  Again, why did you do this?
[03:03:50.055 --> 03:03:51.416]  Let me illustrate one thing.
[03:03:51.416 --> 03:03:58.899]  There's been a little heat from the corporate side of my workplace.
[03:03:58.899 --> 03:04:03.020]  What I've explained to them is, hey, this is where I work, but I live in the real world.
[03:04:05.100 --> 03:04:10.922]  You know, I'm sorry I can't stand idly by any longer and just pretend like all this stuff is going to fix itself.
[03:04:10.922 --> 03:04:22.747]  But if I've got a platform that others don't, that others need, if I've got a voice that can be of service to those that need me, then I'm going to use it.
[03:04:22.747 --> 03:04:33.872]  You know, and I had an amazing example growing up of my father, who stood in the face of tyranny my entire life and was ridiculed and criticized and called insane and misguided and uninformed.
[03:04:34.505 --> 03:04:35.786]  I don't know.
[03:04:54.452 --> 03:04:55.813]  Charlie, we've got a break again.
[03:04:55.813 --> 03:05:00.855]  I want to come back and speak about that, go through more of the points, and we're going to go to Bob McIlvain as well.
[03:05:00.855 --> 03:05:06.118]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:05:06.118 --> 03:05:10.640]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:05:10.640 --> 03:05:12.921]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:05:12.921 --> 03:05:14.541]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:05:14.541 --> 03:05:15.582]  There is a solution.
[03:05:15.802 --> 03:05:24.230]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[03:05:24.230 --> 03:05:31.697]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.

[03:05:37.723 --> 03:05:43.746]  I love their Nutri-Cafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.

[03:06:03.214 --> 03:06:06.555]  A new world order in the near future.
[03:06:07.865 --> 03:06:10.906]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:06:10.906 --> 03:06:13.747]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:06:13.747 --> 03:06:16.547]  Put their objective being world domination.
[03:06:16.547 --> 03:06:19.728]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:06:19.728 --> 03:06:27.030]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:06:30.080 --> 03:06:35.523]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:06:35.523 --> 03:06:39.384]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:06:39.384 --> 03:06:41.946]  Build America is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:06:41.946 --> 03:06:43.126]  Most people have no idea.
[03:06:43.126 --> 03:06:43.906]  They're not after money.
[03:06:43.906 --> 03:06:45.187]  They have all the money they need.
[03:06:45.187 --> 03:06:46.027]  They're after power.
[03:06:46.027 --> 03:06:47.308]  That's what they're after these years.

[03:06:58.833 --> 03:06:59.894]  You have been warned.
[03:07:00.814 --> 03:07:01.574]  Hello, friends.
[03:07:01.574 --> 03:07:04.695]  This is Alex Jones here to tell you about Cal Bend Soap.
[03:07:04.695 --> 03:07:14.859]  My staff and I just love the old-fashioned, pure, handmade soap produced by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company that's over 62 years old.
[03:07:14.859 --> 03:07:18.780]  Go to 5starsoaps.com or click on their link at InfoWars.com.
[03:07:18.780 --> 03:07:20.761]  They have been a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:07:20.761 --> 03:07:24.582]  Cal Bend Soaps meet the highest standards of quality, purity, and value.
[03:07:24.582 --> 03:07:26.723]  Everyone should use their great line of products.
[03:07:27.143 --> 03:07:32.351]  I consistently hear from my listeners and friends how much they love the Calvin Pure Soap products.

[03:08:02.011 --> 03:08:07.552]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:09.437 --> 03:08:10.778]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:08:10.778 --> 03:08:12.279]  to 3 p.m.
[03:08:12.279 --> 03:08:13.579]  Central Standard Time.
[03:08:13.579 --> 03:08:14.320]  We're here live.
[03:08:14.320 --> 03:08:16.421]  We're not left or right.
[03:08:16.421 --> 03:08:18.082]  We are against corruption.
[03:08:18.082 --> 03:08:24.045]  We're against socialism, communism, imperialism, any form of command-and-control tyranny.
[03:08:24.045 --> 03:08:25.586]  And we just tell the truth.
[03:08:25.586 --> 03:08:28.787]  We have a declassified government document in ABC News.
[03:08:28.787 --> 03:08:29.988]  Operation Northwoods, U.S.
[03:08:29.988 --> 03:08:31.029]  government plan to bomb U.S.
[03:08:31.029 --> 03:08:32.830]  cities as pretext for war.
[03:08:32.830 --> 03:08:35.591]  We have Army field manuals with the government stages terror.
[03:08:35.591 --> 03:08:36.451]  It's declassified.
[03:08:36.451 --> 03:08:37.152]  We talk about it.
[03:08:38.945 --> 03:08:42.147]  We know that the Gardasil shots are killing people and it's in the news.
[03:08:42.147 --> 03:08:42.687]  We cover it.
[03:08:42.687 --> 03:08:45.668]  I mean, that's all we do here is tell the truth.
[03:08:45.668 --> 03:08:47.169]  Our only agenda is the truth.
[03:08:47.169 --> 03:08:54.292]  Charlie, we're trying to explain your role models, your father, everything your father has done.
[03:08:54.292 --> 03:08:59.814]  I mean, he spoke out day one with you against the war and you guys really got attacked for that.
[03:08:59.814 --> 03:09:01.374]  Look who was proven right in the end.
[03:09:01.374 --> 03:09:03.875]  How dare your dad say there weren't WMDs.
[03:09:03.875 --> 03:09:05.076]  We're on the right side of history.
[03:09:06.519 --> 03:09:08.100]  Yeah, I think that's really key, Alex.
[03:09:08.100 --> 03:09:10.302]  I think that's really key.
[03:09:10.302 --> 03:09:13.925]  I absolutely believe that myself, that we are on the right side of history.
[03:09:13.925 --> 03:09:20.510]  And I think it's only a matter of time before more join us on that right side.
[03:09:20.510 --> 03:09:32.940]  I think what people need to understand and what has been such a really offensive spin job is that I'm not claiming that I know what
[03:09:33.626 --> 03:09:34.987]  I'm not making those claims.
[03:09:34.987 --> 03:09:39.548]  I'm just asking people to look at the inconsistencies.
[03:09:39.548 --> 03:09:40.529]  Look at the stuff.
[03:09:40.529 --> 03:09:45.091]  Look at the absolute facts that were completely ignored.
[03:09:45.091 --> 03:09:57.235]  You know, when you get into the Doomsday Plane, which Anderson Cooper reported on, and then the Commission deemed it... They had so much to investigate, they didn't feel it was important enough to include in the report.
[03:09:57.235 --> 03:09:58.956]  Guys, it's the Doomsday Plane.
[03:09:59.895 --> 03:10:13.503]  Over New York, over D.C., multiple government E-4Bs, over command and control aircraft, while this is happening, but jets 20-something miles away, F-16s can't get there, but the doomsday planes are over both targets.
[03:10:13.503 --> 03:10:14.423]  It's a real problem.
[03:10:14.423 --> 03:10:16.524]  It needs to be looked at.
[03:10:16.524 --> 03:10:20.607]  It needs to be looked at thoroughly.
[03:10:20.607 --> 03:10:25.750]  Let's subpoena and put those pilots under oath.
[03:10:25.750 --> 03:10:26.410]  Let's do that.
[03:10:27.239 --> 03:10:28.380]  When did you take off?
[03:10:28.380 --> 03:10:29.600]  How long were you in the air?
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:30.441]  What was your mission?
[03:10:30.441 --> 03:10:31.221]  What were you doing there?
[03:10:31.221 --> 03:10:34.543]  What were you told?
[03:10:34.543 --> 03:10:36.144]  And again, Alex, it's not just me.
[03:10:36.144 --> 03:10:40.187]  I mean, these are the questions that the families had at the Commission hearing.
[03:10:40.187 --> 03:10:55.455]  These... This is... All the stuff that was completely swapped aside, and it was absolutely stonewalled at every turn, and frustrated, and screaming out during the proceeding, being escorted away as a security violation.
[03:10:55.455 --> 03:10:56.396]  I mean, come on!
[03:10:57.386 --> 03:10:58.666]  Come on, it's just that.
[03:10:58.666 --> 03:11:04.027]  Yeah, they're in there screaming, saying, cover up inside job, they're drug away.
[03:11:04.027 --> 03:11:06.348]  People like Bob McElveen, whose son died.
[03:11:06.348 --> 03:11:11.409]  And then meanwhile, these media whores get up there and say, all the families disagree with Charlie Sheen.
[03:11:11.409 --> 03:11:17.230]  When, here's an example out of Salon, 9-1-1 truth signatory standby call for new investigation.
[03:11:17.230 --> 03:11:21.851]  And Salon called 50 of these people and only got two of them to halfway recant.
[03:11:21.851 --> 03:11:25.392]  And Salon rightfully said, wrote a positive piece and said, look, people have a right
[03:11:27.034 --> 03:11:30.903]  Of course they do.
[03:11:30.903 --> 03:11:34.511]  I mean, that's the country I was raised in.
[03:11:34.511 --> 03:11:35.674]  That's what I was told to believe in.
[03:11:38.837 --> 03:11:43.098]  Charlie, let's go over some of these other points, but before we do that, I want to go back to Cybele Edmonds.
[03:11:43.098 --> 03:11:46.499]  She's the FBI translator listening to NSA Intercepts.
[03:11:46.499 --> 03:11:49.080]  She goes public on this show and other shows about four years ago.
[03:11:49.080 --> 03:11:50.380]  Federal gag order.
[03:11:50.380 --> 03:11:51.860]  She's trying to get around it.
[03:11:51.860 --> 03:11:57.982]  She's saying drug running, terrorist funding, human trafficking, murder, hit teams.
[03:11:57.982 --> 03:12:03.963]  That's now all come out that Cheney was running hit teams in mainstream news, illegally, even in the U.S.
[03:12:03.963 --> 03:12:05.964]  against non-Al Qaeda, Al-Qaeda targets.
[03:12:07.009 --> 03:12:13.752]  And she comes out now, breaks the federal gag order about a month ago, it was the middle of August, and goes public.
[03:12:13.752 --> 03:12:22.276]  We've got clips in the video, your message to the President saying, up until the day of 9-11, Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda and Taliban were working for the CIA.
[03:12:22.276 --> 03:12:27.218]  Yeah, and it didn't get any mainstream coverage whatsoever.
[03:12:27.218 --> 03:12:31.140]  Why is that not the top story on the 6 o'clock evening news?
[03:12:32.737 --> 03:12:40.300]  Why is the FBI revealing that Ted Olson, the Secretary General, never got the phone call from his wife?
[03:12:40.300 --> 03:12:44.021]  Why is that not the lead story on the 6 o'clock evening news?
[03:12:44.021 --> 03:12:45.401]  What about the cell phones?
[03:12:45.401 --> 03:12:47.862]  They still can't make them work above 10,000 feet.
[03:12:47.862 --> 03:12:53.264]  Every time I'm on a flight, I try, as I take off with it, you know, to see when it cuts out.
[03:12:53.264 --> 03:12:55.064]  It does it at about 3,000 feet every time.
[03:12:55.064 --> 03:12:56.985]  I know how tall these radio towers are.
[03:12:56.985 --> 03:12:57.365]  They're 2,000.
[03:12:57.365 --> 03:12:58.846]  I get about 1,000 above.
[03:12:58.846 --> 03:12:59.466]  It cuts out.
[03:13:00.326 --> 03:13:05.188]  If I'm lucky, flying into LA and places, I'll have it on at 20,000, 10,000.
[03:13:05.188 --> 03:13:07.409]  The sucker doesn't turn on until 1,000 feet or so.
[03:13:07.409 --> 03:13:08.209]  Sure.
[03:13:08.209 --> 03:13:10.190]  Then they admit she didn't use their phones.
[03:13:10.190 --> 03:13:16.753]  Then the FBI says, yeah, we have no record of her ever making her call getting through to him, to Ted Olson.
[03:13:16.753 --> 03:13:17.713]  Give us your take on that.
[03:13:17.713 --> 03:13:21.375]  These magical cell phones that on a bunch of flights were working that day.
[03:13:22.130 --> 03:13:43.704]  Well, again, Alex, I think that these are areas that, you know, we can only ask that some scientific research be presented behind, and that, you know, for us to sit here and try to figure all that out, I mean, at face value it sounds absurd, but let's investigate it.
[03:13:43.704 --> 03:13:44.945]  Let's look at it further.
[03:13:44.945 --> 03:13:47.727]  Let's turn it over to some experts.
[03:13:47.727 --> 03:13:48.788]  Let's see what they have to say.
[03:13:49.411 --> 03:13:50.571]  Forget my opinion of it.
[03:13:50.571 --> 03:13:51.572]  Forget your opinion of it.
[03:13:51.572 --> 03:13:57.233]  I mean, yeah, it's pretty obvious, but still, let's put it in the hands of the people that do that stuff for a living.
[03:13:57.233 --> 03:13:58.893]  Guys a thousand times smarter than me.
[03:13:58.893 --> 03:14:01.774]  Stuff they do all day, every day.
[03:14:01.774 --> 03:14:07.155]  Let's give it to them, along with all these other points.
[03:14:07.155 --> 03:14:12.957]  All these other facts and, you know, omissions, as they were and as they are.
[03:14:15.481 --> 03:14:25.952]  Charlie, I have Bob McIlvain on the line with us, and we're going to have him on for about five minutes or so, then we're going to go back through some of the final points of the time we have left with you today.
[03:14:25.952 --> 03:14:30.716]  But there's a famous quote by Bob McIlvain about his son.
[03:14:30.716 --> 03:14:33.799]  He says, it upsets me tremendously that Bobby, my son who died,
[03:14:34.660 --> 03:14:41.125]  Could be used as a political pawn to be manipulated at times like this and abused.
[03:14:41.125 --> 03:14:52.333]  And he went on from there, but instead of his reading quotes from Bob, who lost his son Bobby on 9-11, I want to go ahead and go to him now.
[03:14:52.333 --> 03:14:56.356]  Bob McIlvain, who was in the 9-11 Commission, who tried to speak to him.
[03:14:56.356 --> 03:14:59.939]  Sir, what do you think on this 8th anniversary about what Charlie and all of us are doing?
[03:15:01.343 --> 03:15:12.865]  Well, if anyone does anything, I just so greatly appreciate it because, you know, it's very difficult to, you know, no one can sit there and coordinate what's happening.
[03:15:12.865 --> 03:15:19.146]  And as Charlie just said, you know, you hear these things, but, you know, they have to be investigated.
[03:15:19.146 --> 03:15:26.608]  Well, that's what I've spent my life doing because, you know, after going to the 9-11 Commission hearing, I came out so disgusted, absolutely disgusted, that
[03:15:27.475 --> 03:15:31.438]  You know, and Denise had even said that this is not an investigation.
[03:15:31.438 --> 03:15:33.460]  It's merely an exposition.
[03:15:33.460 --> 03:15:37.523]  And again, I always tell people to look at it as a parent.
[03:15:37.523 --> 03:15:40.605]  And as a parent, my son was murdered.
[03:15:40.605 --> 03:15:46.090]  And here, the 9-11 Commission, who were supposed to be investigating the murder of my son.
[03:15:46.090 --> 03:15:47.411]  And I try to keep it to myself.
[03:15:47.411 --> 03:15:53.876]  I'm not a spokesperson for anyone else in the 9-11 movement, because that's my job as a parent, as a father.
[03:15:54.465 --> 03:15:56.166]  To find out how my son was murdered.
[03:15:56.166 --> 03:16:02.010]  And I actually thought maybe during the 9-11 killing, maybe they're going to really find out if it's true.
[03:16:02.010 --> 03:16:05.893]  Well, I came into that saying, well, nothing they told me is true.
[03:16:05.893 --> 03:16:13.458]  So I'll tell people, you know, they say, oh, you're getting involved in these conspiracy theories, conspiracy theories.
[03:16:13.458 --> 03:16:14.478]  That's all I'm doing.
[03:16:14.478 --> 03:16:16.500]  Please tell me what happened.
[03:16:16.500 --> 03:16:22.744]  I mean, God, when you hear the FBI says that we can't prove that Obama, Sondland, and Biden was part of it,
[03:16:23.603 --> 03:16:27.852]  Uh, you know, when I pick up the flight manifest, I don't see any Arabs on it.
[03:16:27.852 --> 03:16:31.900]  Well, I don't know for sure who's on the plane, but I certainly think, jeez, what happened here?
[03:16:31.900 --> 03:16:32.361]  You know what I mean?
[03:16:32.694 --> 03:16:41.478]  Well, Bob McIlvain, a former school teacher in Philadelphia, whose son Bobby was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York on September 11th, is joining us.
[03:16:41.478 --> 03:16:50.382]  Bob, what about magic passports at the Pentagon, at Shanksville with Flight 93, and at the World Trade Center?
[03:16:50.382 --> 03:16:57.685]  Less than a day after, with feet of rubble and dust and papers everywhere, the FBI find an unscathed passport
[03:16:58.385 --> 03:17:00.426]  of one of the lead hijackers.
[03:17:00.426 --> 03:17:01.686]  I mean, come on!
[03:17:01.686 --> 03:17:05.007]  How obvious does this have to get?
[03:17:05.007 --> 03:17:11.849]  Well, you know, with that, you know, I would still say to someone that, sorry, they found the passport there.
[03:17:11.849 --> 03:17:14.190]  It's mind-boggling to me.
[03:17:14.190 --> 03:17:15.670]  I mean, immediately I heard that.
[03:17:15.670 --> 03:17:17.731]  I said, this doesn't sound right.
[03:17:17.731 --> 03:17:20.892]  But I wouldn't base anything on that.
[03:17:20.892 --> 03:17:23.593]  You know, the more I investigate, of course, we don't have the time.
[03:17:23.593 --> 03:17:27.474]  I could sit here for six months and we could talk about 9-11.
[03:17:29.282 --> 03:17:34.405]  We'll do another show with you and maybe Charlie can come back in a few weeks.
[03:17:34.405 --> 03:17:45.290]  When you're on a landline, I know you were down there at the memorial today, you're traveling back in a car right now on cell phone, but Charlie, I know you and Bob have talked privately, I got you guys together.
[03:17:45.290 --> 03:17:48.111]  Would you like to say anything to Bob McIlwain?
[03:17:48.111 --> 03:17:53.934]  Bob, I just want to say that I'm just so deeply sorry for your loss.
[03:17:53.934 --> 03:17:57.596]  I'm a father of five and I can't even imagine
[03:17:58.703 --> 03:18:14.046]  What you've been through for almost a decade now, and I hope that my efforts and the efforts of people like Alex and all of those that are joining our cause are already a part of it.
[03:18:14.046 --> 03:18:21.448]  I hope that we can not only deliver some hope, but we can also deliver some answers.
[03:18:21.448 --> 03:18:22.628]  Bob?
[03:18:22.628 --> 03:18:23.248]  Thanks, Charlie.
[03:18:23.248 --> 03:18:24.409]  Appreciate that.
[03:18:24.409 --> 03:18:25.869]  It's the least I can do, Bob.
[03:18:25.869 --> 03:18:26.589]  It's my duty.
[03:18:27.785 --> 03:18:44.814]  Bob, does it anger you, I mean I know I've talked to you on the phone, it does, to watch Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, Bill O'Reilly saying none of the families think it's an inside job, that they're angry at Charlie, but they never bring these people on the show, they're just, they're lying saying this.
[03:18:44.814 --> 03:18:46.635]  Is that to me, Alex?
[03:18:46.635 --> 03:18:48.516]  Yes, does that make you mad?
[03:18:48.516 --> 03:18:57.121]  I try not to get angry, I really have to work on my anger, and I really watch the show, and I just, I look at them as entertainers.
[03:18:57.907 --> 03:18:59.828]  And to me, it's a bit reclinish.
[03:18:59.828 --> 03:19:05.269]  I mean, if you look at it going back, I mean, they're there to make money as far as I'm concerned.
[03:19:05.269 --> 03:19:06.830]  And they do that to get people angry.
[03:19:06.830 --> 03:19:11.171]  And that's why, you know, sometimes you really have to protect yourself and try to stay away from people.
[03:19:11.171 --> 03:19:13.672]  Specifically, they are misrepresenting the families.
[03:19:13.672 --> 03:19:16.913]  I've interviewed all the heads of the biggest groups and they all say they have
[03:19:18.390 --> 03:19:19.591]  There's no question about that.
[03:19:19.591 --> 03:19:27.134]  But you know, they have that kind of power because if people hear it from them, they don't believe it.
[03:19:27.134 --> 03:19:32.977]  Just to be clear on record, you and many other family members and victims are not angry at Charlie.
[03:19:32.977 --> 03:19:38.960]  I mean, are you tired of them misrepresenting you and wrapping themselves in the victims?
[03:19:38.960 --> 03:19:39.940]  Of course I am.
[03:19:39.940 --> 03:19:43.622]  You know, I do get angry, but that's why I won't watch the show.
[03:19:43.622 --> 03:19:45.203]  Because it gets me angry.
[03:19:45.203 --> 03:19:46.563]  You have to stay cool.
[03:19:46.563 --> 03:19:47.444]  You have to stay calm.
[03:19:48.972 --> 03:19:51.433]  You can't get the word out if you don't.
[03:19:51.433 --> 03:19:58.675]  And I'll tell people that I know thousands of people, not personally, but just from the website.
[03:19:58.675 --> 03:20:03.116]  And sometimes it gets me angry that more than 9-11 family members aren't doing more.
[03:20:03.116 --> 03:20:11.919]  I've told people, I say, if we had 200 family members who went down there and did civil disobedience down at the Pentagon or down at the FBI building, I'll tell you what, we would get something done.
[03:20:12.884 --> 03:20:18.126]  But, you know, it's just such an emotional thing to get involved in, and that's where the problem is.
[03:20:18.126 --> 03:20:26.889]  They'll hear from family members that they feel that this is horrible, what we're doing, but they just don't hear from the other family members because it's so difficult to do this.
[03:20:26.889 --> 03:20:27.389]  Sure.
[03:20:27.389 --> 03:20:36.833]  Bob, in closing, Bob, in closing, specifically, what do you, from your research, believe happened on 9-11?
[03:20:36.833 --> 03:20:40.274]  I think it had 19 patsies that came in that were trained in the United States.
[03:20:40.274 --> 03:20:42.095]  A kid named Jake Bahamut was a patsy.
[03:20:42.677 --> 03:20:43.358]  I don't know.
[03:20:53.954 --> 03:20:55.875]  Those planes should have been intercepted.
[03:20:55.875 --> 03:21:01.579]  And what happened in the months before and what happened on that day is just unbelievable.
[03:21:01.579 --> 03:21:02.700]  And that's where the story is.
[03:21:02.700 --> 03:21:07.364]  It seems a lot of 9-11 troopers, I don't know if they ignore it, but we don't talk about it.
[03:21:07.364 --> 03:21:09.125]  Those planes should have been intercepted.
[03:21:09.125 --> 03:21:10.886]  That's standard procedure.
[03:21:10.886 --> 03:21:16.650]  And real quickly, General Meyers said, well, we're trained to look at the outside.
[03:21:16.650 --> 03:21:21.894]  But one of the missions of NORAD, and it's been since 1958, when NORAD was
[03:21:24.181 --> 03:21:27.923]  Bob, in closing here, we're gonna have some final comments from Charlie Sheen.
[03:21:43.109 --> 03:21:58.382]  Charlie has talked to you, I've talked to you, you want to go on Larry King Live, you're ready to debate whoever they put up against you, and you do, I mean, but in your own words, you would be, you want to go with Charlie and other 9-11 victims and meet with President Obama?
[03:21:58.382 --> 03:22:00.083]  Absolutely, Alex.
[03:22:00.083 --> 03:22:02.745]  Just tell me, just tell me where and when.
[03:22:02.745 --> 03:22:07.850]  But, but, but Bob, you're, you're ready to, you want to go and meet with President Obama?
[03:22:07.850 --> 03:22:09.231]  I would, I would meet with anybody.
[03:22:10.393 --> 03:22:11.794]  I'll meet with the man on the moon.
[03:22:11.794 --> 03:22:16.236]  That's what it took to get the truth out.
[03:22:16.236 --> 03:22:18.417]  I'd be willing to meet with anyone.
[03:22:18.417 --> 03:22:19.258]  To get the truth out?
[03:22:19.258 --> 03:22:21.799]  Especially the president.
[03:22:21.799 --> 03:22:22.579]  Alright, Bob.
[03:22:22.579 --> 03:22:24.340]  Let's start at the top, Bob.
[03:22:24.340 --> 03:22:25.721]  Let's start at the top.
[03:22:25.721 --> 03:22:28.002]  Work our way down.
[03:22:28.002 --> 03:22:29.603]  Alright, Bob McIlvain, God bless you.
[03:22:29.603 --> 03:22:33.125]  Sorry about your son's loss, but he lives on through your grandson who you're raising.
[03:22:33.125 --> 03:22:34.986]  God bless you, sir, on this 8th anniversary.
[03:22:34.986 --> 03:22:35.386]  Take care.
[03:22:35.386 --> 03:22:37.887]  Alright, hey, thank you, Alex.
[03:22:37.887 --> 03:22:38.447]  You bet, Bob.
[03:22:40.373 --> 03:22:40.933]  There he goes.
[03:22:40.933 --> 03:22:44.556]  Okay, in the six, seven minutes we have left with Charlie Sheen.
[03:22:44.556 --> 03:22:51.440]  Charlie, your letter, your statements, your video message to the President, a call to arms.
[03:22:51.440 --> 03:22:53.281]  You're the General.
[03:22:53.281 --> 03:22:54.282]  Millions are listening.
[03:22:54.282 --> 03:22:57.404]  Tens of millions will view this later and listen to it later.
[03:22:57.404 --> 03:22:59.145]  The call to arms, the call to action.
[03:22:59.145 --> 03:23:01.826]  What do you want to see in 9-11 Truth, my friend?
[03:23:01.826 --> 03:23:04.108]  I want people to start standing up.
[03:23:04.108 --> 03:23:06.189]  I want people, first of all, to wake up.
[03:23:06.189 --> 03:23:08.390]  Those that haven't already.
[03:23:08.390 --> 03:23:09.331]  And then, and then,
[03:23:10.572 --> 03:23:12.372]  Sorry to interrupt.
[03:23:12.372 --> 03:23:16.293]  And then just know that they have a voice.
[03:23:16.293 --> 03:23:21.435]  And that through, in mass, in numbers, they have a bigger voice.
[03:23:21.435 --> 03:23:25.256]  And reach out to your local politicians.
[03:23:25.256 --> 03:23:26.436]  Get organized.
[03:23:26.436 --> 03:23:28.236]  Get petitions going.
[03:23:28.236 --> 03:23:29.937]  Make the voice louder.
[03:23:29.937 --> 03:23:32.558]  Bring this thing to a point where they cannot ignore it.
[03:23:32.558 --> 03:23:33.938]  Where it isn't just, you know,
[03:23:34.594 --> 03:23:37.655]  Whack job actor from Hollywood talking about fantasy theories.
[03:23:37.655 --> 03:23:39.035]  Get involved, people.
[03:23:39.035 --> 03:23:39.695]  Get out there.
[03:23:39.695 --> 03:23:41.056]  Do something.
[03:23:41.056 --> 03:23:47.637]  It's one thing to say, and I really appreciate all the comments and all the support, but take that energy and put it into action.
[03:23:47.637 --> 03:23:50.838]  Put it into action and demand the truth.
[03:23:50.838 --> 03:23:53.559]  Get on the right side of history with us.
[03:23:55.933 --> 03:23:56.733]  Beautifully said.
[03:23:56.733 --> 03:24:03.614]  9-11 was meant by the scientific dictatorship, the controllers, in their own documents.
[03:24:03.614 --> 03:24:06.655]  They talk about how they would stage massive terror attacks to get total power.
[03:24:06.655 --> 03:24:11.096]  It was meant to be the event to set up a planetary police state.
[03:24:11.096 --> 03:24:24.358]  I believe 9-11 is going to end up, and also these premeditated, offensive crimes against humanity, these offensive, preemptive wars, I believe it's going to be their waterloo, Charlie.
[03:24:25.993 --> 03:24:27.614]  I hope you're right, Alex.
[03:24:27.614 --> 03:24:28.295]  I hope you're right.
[03:24:28.295 --> 03:24:46.891]  I mean, you know, this stuff happens in broad daylight, and that's the arrogance, that's the pathology that we're dealing with here.
[03:24:46.891 --> 03:24:53.617]  We just need to keep asking the hard questions, keep insisting that people don't
[03:24:54.187 --> 03:24:57.268]  Allow ourselves to be dismissed.
[03:24:57.268 --> 03:24:58.748]  Just pushed over there.
[03:24:58.748 --> 03:25:06.649]  And I think it's, you know, it's like what Aaron Russo said so wonderfully in his final interview in that wonderful documentary that you put together with him.
[03:25:06.649 --> 03:25:09.310]  He said, don't be afraid to be called stupid.
[03:25:09.310 --> 03:25:11.050]  Don't be afraid to be called crazy.
[03:25:11.050 --> 03:25:12.610]  Don't be afraid to have a voice.
[03:25:12.610 --> 03:25:15.791]  Don't be afraid to stand up and say, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, people.
[03:25:15.791 --> 03:25:17.951]  This doesn't make any sense.
[03:25:17.951 --> 03:25:20.752]  And I'm insisting that somebody, somebody look at this.
[03:25:21.468 --> 03:25:28.891]  Somebody that has the power to make a change needs to look at this enough.
[03:25:28.891 --> 03:25:31.732]  Well, Charlie Sheen, your courage is an example to all of us.
[03:25:31.732 --> 03:25:38.535]  A man who is the highest paid TV actor out there, five children, a great life, and takes a lot of risk.
[03:25:38.535 --> 03:25:42.196]  And I know this has been good for your soul, as you've said many times to me.
[03:25:42.196 --> 03:25:46.698]  Food for the soul, but at the same time, very stressful.
[03:25:46.698 --> 03:25:49.899]  And if we all lead by your example,
[03:25:51.192 --> 03:25:55.074]  We're gonna be in a better world because great tyranny is upon us and people better get involved.
[03:25:55.074 --> 03:25:59.357]  We're being lied to about the banking takeover, the $23.7 trillion.
[03:25:59.357 --> 03:26:06.401]  I know you'd also said that the Obama deception, you'd supported Obama, really also helped crystallize that why isn't he calling for an investigation?
[03:26:06.401 --> 03:26:08.342]  What was your take on the Obama deception?
[03:26:08.342 --> 03:26:09.903]  That was a masterpiece, Alex.
[03:26:09.903 --> 03:26:11.524]  Really, I think it should be mandatory.
[03:26:12.284 --> 03:26:23.386]  Doing for anybody in this country, especially those who voted for him like myself, and anybody else on the planet that wants the truth about what's really going on.
[03:26:23.386 --> 03:26:32.949]  I would urge people to get it, make copies, hand it out, promote it, organize groups to watch it, hold screenings.
[03:26:35.788 --> 03:26:40.370]  Along with Endgame, it is one of the most important documentaries ever produced.
[03:26:40.370 --> 03:26:50.014]  And I tip my hat to you for having the courage to deliver such an important historical piece.
[03:26:50.014 --> 03:26:52.795]  I'm just proud to know you, man.
[03:26:52.795 --> 03:26:54.876]  Hey, I'm proud to call you my friend.
[03:26:54.876 --> 03:26:56.997]  Hey, I'm proud to call you my friend.
[03:26:56.997 --> 03:26:59.818]  You know, we didn't go over all the 20 points that are in your letter.
[03:26:59.818 --> 03:27:01.619]  You know what?
[03:27:01.619 --> 03:27:02.619]  They speak for themselves.
[03:27:03.223 --> 03:27:08.087]  You know, and the mainstream media ain't going over the 20 points either, and what does that say?
[03:27:08.087 --> 03:27:09.127]  What does that say, Alex?
[03:27:09.127 --> 03:27:11.929]  They won't even talk about them.
[03:27:11.929 --> 03:27:16.953]  If I'm so crazy, if I align myself with so many nutbags, and you know, how dare I?
[03:27:16.953 --> 03:27:22.297]  I'm so unpatriotic, and I'm such a, you know, a complete nutjob.
[03:27:22.297 --> 03:27:24.419]  Why won't they address what I wrote?
[03:27:24.419 --> 03:27:26.800]  Why won't they address what we assembled?
[03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:30.203]  Why won't they even look at it, or even talk about it?
[03:27:30.203 --> 03:27:31.404]  That speaks volumes.
[03:27:32.102 --> 03:27:33.822]  That shows their hand.
[03:27:33.822 --> 03:27:41.464]  I agree, but I don't want to end this interview in the few minutes we've got left without you getting into Building 7.
[03:27:41.464 --> 03:27:49.546]  And you say in the piece, just watch the video of the collapse, and we have a link to the police and firemen saying, we've been told to get back, they're going to blow it up.
[03:27:49.546 --> 03:27:52.786]  BBC reports it's fallen completely in its own footprint.
[03:27:52.786 --> 03:27:55.967]  Before it falls, then they said, oh, that video's not real.
[03:27:55.967 --> 03:27:56.867]  Then they admitted it was real.
[03:27:56.867 --> 03:27:58.787]  Then they said, oh, we lost the tapes.
[03:27:58.787 --> 03:28:01.728]  Then they said, okay, Reuters told us it had fallen.
[03:28:03.965 --> 03:28:06.666]  Yeah, they didn't really have their story straight.
[03:28:06.666 --> 03:28:09.728]  Or they got the story and then they just rolled it out early.
[03:28:09.728 --> 03:28:15.191]  I don't know, but the reason that that is the one point, and it's obviously number seven, because it's building seven, that's pretty obvious.
[03:28:15.191 --> 03:28:26.437]  The reason that I only gave it one line is, if I'm not mistaken, wasn't it reduced to a footnote in the official report?
[03:28:26.437 --> 03:28:26.717]  Yes.
[03:28:29.571 --> 03:28:40.040]  They gave it that much attention and the attention that we give it in the piece I think is really powerful because it's just like basically saying, Mr. President, just take a look for yourself.
[03:28:40.040 --> 03:28:42.002]  You're a really smart guy.
[03:28:42.002 --> 03:28:43.583]  You're a really educated man.
[03:28:43.583 --> 03:28:45.225]  Just take a look for yourself.
[03:28:45.225 --> 03:28:45.545]  You know what?
[03:28:45.545 --> 03:28:47.087]  Let's watch it together.
[03:28:47.087 --> 03:28:50.850]  And then you tell me, is that the result of the, you know, from fire?
[03:28:52.011 --> 03:28:58.576]  Charlie, I know you've got to go to work and tape two-and-a-half men that's going to be airing Monday, so I'm going to just let you go in just two or three minutes.
[03:28:58.576 --> 03:29:00.017]  He's in premiere on the 21st.
[03:29:00.017 --> 03:29:01.798]  Couldn't help but put in a plug, Alec.
[03:29:01.798 --> 03:29:02.999]  Hey, that's a great show.
[03:29:02.999 --> 03:29:04.180]  The guys are fans in here.
[03:29:04.180 --> 03:29:04.961]  Thank you.
[03:29:04.961 --> 03:29:05.221]  Thank you.
[03:29:05.221 --> 03:29:05.741]  Especially Jeremy.
[03:29:05.741 --> 03:29:06.422]  He loves it.
[03:29:06.422 --> 03:29:10.004]  Also, hey, Alec, big shout-out to your whole staff.
[03:29:10.004 --> 03:29:17.650]  Guys like Aaron, Kurt, Paul, the guys that just worked 22-hour days leading up to this thing, and they just really, really showed.
[03:29:18.188 --> 03:29:20.870]  Who they are, what they're made of, and how much they care as well.
[03:29:20.870 --> 03:29:34.181]  These are the guys behind the scenes that don't get the type of attention you and I get, but everybody needs to know how important they were in this whole process of launching 20 Minutes with the President.
[03:29:34.181 --> 03:29:36.543]  Yeah, I always almost give it its codename.
[03:29:36.543 --> 03:29:42.928]  20 Minutes with the President.
[03:29:42.928 --> 03:29:45.730]  It's tempting, Alex.
[03:29:45.730 --> 03:29:46.491]  Keep that between us.
[03:29:49.250 --> 03:29:50.766]  Charlie, in closing though...
[03:29:52.381 --> 03:30:00.606]  Are you disappointed that so far the White House called you and said, look, we've seen it, we might pass on it, which shows they're leaving the door open.
[03:30:00.606 --> 03:30:04.928]  I know you're calling people to go out, get involved, go to town halls, go to his press conferences.
[03:30:04.928 --> 03:30:10.431]  You're asking, I know you've asked me to ask folks to tell people to go to the press conferences of the President, go to demonstrations.
[03:30:10.431 --> 03:30:11.412]  Let's make this a big issue.
[03:30:11.412 --> 03:30:13.453]  Let's beat the drum.
[03:30:13.453 --> 03:30:19.316]  Speak to that in closing and directly to Obama, because there's no doubt that the White House is watching and seeing this.
[03:30:20.521 --> 03:30:21.321]  Let's hope.
[03:30:21.321 --> 03:30:21.701]  Let's hope.
[03:30:21.701 --> 03:30:28.363]  I mean, I know, like I said, they got their hands full with a lot of other stuff, but they need to know that this really matters.
[03:30:28.363 --> 03:30:42.607]  This is, you know, it's all laid out in the letter, that, you know, how much this has shaped the current policy and, you know, why the landscape exists as it does today.
[03:30:42.607 --> 03:30:49.869]  And, you know, if they cannot meet with myself and
[03:30:50.914 --> 03:30:55.058]  Family members, um, they really need to write me a letter and explain why.
[03:30:55.058 --> 03:30:56.539]  I wrote them a letter.
[03:30:56.539 --> 03:30:58.641]  And, um, they need to explain why.
[03:30:58.641 --> 03:31:08.308]  And they need to know that that letter will be made public because it's important that people know how they feel about this.
[03:31:08.308 --> 03:31:13.873]  That people know, you know, if they got nothing to hide, then why are they avoiding it?
[03:31:15.049 --> 03:31:17.690]  And let's be clear, it's not just Charlie Sheen meeting with the President.
[03:31:17.690 --> 03:31:24.272]  You've said in the emails, I'd like to come with Bob McIlvain, Bill Doyle, others, and they want to meet with you.
[03:31:24.272 --> 03:31:26.372]  They've tried to meet with the Commission.
[03:31:26.372 --> 03:31:27.512]  Absolutely, yes.
[03:31:27.512 --> 03:31:31.433]  Yeah, no, they, uh, they deserve the time.
[03:31:31.433 --> 03:31:32.974]  They deserve the attention.
[03:31:32.974 --> 03:31:44.217]  They deserve that, uh, that, that, that, you know, that our Commander-in-Chief would, uh, would take a look at this and would hopefully say, yeah, okay, alright, this is, uh,
[03:31:45.117 --> 03:31:45.858]  This is important.
[03:31:45.858 --> 03:31:46.378]  This matters.
[03:31:46.378 --> 03:31:54.924]  And yes, I do have the power and I do have the responsibility as your president to use my executive power to enact a real investigation.
[03:31:54.924 --> 03:31:56.486]  Put this thing back on the front burner.
[03:31:56.486 --> 03:31:58.627]  Put it on the front burner, Mr. President.
[03:31:58.627 --> 03:32:00.108]  Enough is enough.
[03:32:00.108 --> 03:32:11.357]  So, bottom line, you're saying at least publicly respond to the 20 questions or just respond to 6 of the 10 commission members and 2 of the 5 council members saying it was a fraud, a criminal cover-up.
[03:32:11.357 --> 03:32:11.717]  Anything.
[03:32:11.717 --> 03:32:13.158]  Now, let's just acknowledge it.
[03:32:13.158 --> 03:32:14.499]  Just be courageous enough
[03:32:14.958 --> 03:32:18.663]  And compassionate enough to acknowledge it.
[03:32:18.663 --> 03:32:20.245]  That's all I'm asking.
[03:32:20.245 --> 03:32:22.408]  And if we can take it further, great!
[03:32:22.408 --> 03:32:23.950]  But just acknowledge it.
[03:32:23.950 --> 03:32:26.413]  Stop treating us like we don't matter.
[03:32:33.383 --> 03:32:39.265]  How are the fires out in Los Angeles getting under control?
[03:32:39.265 --> 03:32:47.688]  Yeah, no, the fire teams out here did an amazing job getting this stuff put out as quickly as possible.
[03:32:47.688 --> 03:32:54.830]  Unfortunately, there were some lives lost and it's hard to go out to their families as well.
[03:32:57.048 --> 03:33:00.490]  The skies are clear and everything's back to normal.
[03:33:00.490 --> 03:33:07.515]  Yeah, it was like a week and a half ago when I was there, it was like flying into hell and you had ashes raining down on your backyard.
[03:33:07.515 --> 03:33:10.477]  Yeah, it was interesting.
[03:33:10.477 --> 03:33:18.103]  It created sort of a symbolic climate for creating this piece as we went through it.
[03:33:19.201 --> 03:33:20.081]  Charlie, I love you.
[03:33:20.081 --> 03:33:21.942]  I love you too, man.
[03:33:21.942 --> 03:33:23.543]  And I love your passion.
[03:33:23.543 --> 03:33:24.823]  And I love everything you're doing.
[03:33:24.823 --> 03:33:28.385]  And it was great seeing your dad and mom when they came over.
[03:33:28.385 --> 03:33:29.525]  And say hi to Al.
[03:33:29.525 --> 03:33:31.246]  Say hi to Lance.
[03:33:31.246 --> 03:33:32.286]  Say hi to the whole crew.
[03:33:32.286 --> 03:33:33.727]  And God bless you, my friend.
[03:33:33.727 --> 03:33:34.567]  God bless you, Alex.
[03:33:36.343 --> 03:33:36.964]  All right, Charlie.
[03:33:36.964 --> 03:33:39.806]  I'm going to go ahead, I'm going to say bye to you here off air.
[03:33:39.806 --> 03:33:46.211]  We're going to air, one more time, the six and a half minute piece, his address, his reaching out, Charlie Sheen to the President.
[03:33:46.211 --> 03:33:58.281]  As I say bye to Charlie here, we're going to come back in six minutes and take your phone calls and recap this historic, amazing interview, this redeclaration of 9-11 truth, declaring war on the lie, the fraud, that is the fable, that is the official story of 9-11.
[03:33:58.281 --> 03:33:58.601]  Here it is.
[03:33:59.842 --> 03:34:01.484]  No warning signs that I'm aware of.
[03:34:01.484 --> 03:34:05.207]  Man, it was a revelation that the White House had no intention of making public.
[03:34:05.207 --> 03:34:11.472]  President Bush was told in August that Osama bin Laden might be planning an attack involving the hijackers.
[03:34:11.472 --> 03:34:14.254]  Nobody in our government at least.
[03:34:14.254 --> 03:34:19.319]  I believe the title was Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the United States.
[03:34:21.294 --> 03:34:25.478]  70% of family members' questions were never answered during the 9-11 Commission Report.
[03:34:25.478 --> 03:34:28.141]  Lee Hamilton and Thomas Kean said they were set up to fail.
[03:34:28.141 --> 03:34:29.522]  I mean, I'm a member of the Commission.
[03:34:29.522 --> 03:34:30.283]  It's a scam.
[03:34:30.283 --> 03:34:32.465]  It's absolutely disgusting.
[03:34:32.465 --> 03:34:35.068]  The questions, Mr. President.
[03:34:35.068 --> 03:34:38.150]  The questions.
[03:34:38.150 --> 03:34:43.115]  Building 7 ablaze at the moment and apparently getting ready to collapse.
[03:34:43.115 --> 03:34:43.455]  Building 7.
[03:34:44.870 --> 03:34:47.952]  Well, no, there's number seven coming down.
[03:34:47.952 --> 03:34:56.499]  The excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being demolished, and they wired very carefully for days, and it's a very careful operation.
[03:34:56.499 --> 03:35:06.666]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before, when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[03:35:06.666 --> 03:35:09.929]  One of the things they do is pull it.
[03:35:09.929 --> 03:35:13.011]  They made that decision to pull, that we watch the building.
[03:35:14.513 --> 03:35:18.496]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[03:35:18.496 --> 03:35:20.598]  Well, only really what you already know.
[03:35:20.598 --> 03:35:22.340]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[03:35:22.340 --> 03:35:34.210]  We're getting information now that one of the other buildings, Building 7, in the World Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing.
[03:35:34.210 --> 03:35:36.312]  The Pentagon.
[03:35:36.312 --> 03:35:37.013]  Vanishing Airplane.
[03:35:37.674 --> 03:35:43.535]  My close-up inspection, there's no evidence of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon.
[03:35:43.535 --> 03:35:53.697]  The only sight is the actual side of the building that's crashed in, and as I said, the only pieces left that you can see are small enough that you could pick up in your hand.
[03:35:53.697 --> 03:36:05.280]  There are no large tail sections, wing sections, a fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around, which would indicate that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon.
[03:36:05.280 --> 03:36:06.400]  Firefighters and police.
[03:36:07.509 --> 03:36:09.750]  Describing explosions.
[03:36:09.750 --> 03:36:10.651]  A lot of them.
[03:36:10.651 --> 03:36:12.032]  The secondary explosion.
[03:36:12.032 --> 03:36:15.193]  We've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion.
[03:36:15.193 --> 03:36:17.334]  Floor by floor, it's sort of popping out.
[03:36:17.334 --> 03:36:19.716]  It was like, it was as if they had detonated.
[03:36:19.716 --> 03:36:21.857]  As if they were planning to take down a building.
[03:36:21.857 --> 03:36:25.279]  It looked sort of like the building just demolished.
[03:36:25.279 --> 03:36:27.740]  Even if there was no secondary explosives in the building.
[03:36:27.740 --> 03:36:29.061]  It sounded like gunfire.
[03:36:29.061 --> 03:36:30.782]  You know, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[03:36:30.782 --> 03:36:33.403]  And then all of a sudden, three big explosions.
[03:36:33.403 --> 03:36:35.905]  Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building collapse?
[03:36:37.130 --> 03:36:41.011]  To me it sounded like, to me it sounded like an explosion.
[03:36:41.011 --> 03:36:58.638]  Chief Albert Turry told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, but he said that there was another explosion which took place, and then an hour after there was another explosion in one of the towers here.
[03:36:58.638 --> 03:37:02.619]  Cybele Edmonds, FBI translator, breaking her gag order.
[03:37:03.386 --> 03:37:07.350]  All our intimate relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban.
[03:37:07.350 --> 03:37:14.155]  We did carry very intimate relationship with these people all the way up to September 11th.
[03:37:14.155 --> 03:37:19.780]  Bin Laden was spirited into this military hospital in Rawapendi for kidney dialysis treatment.
[03:37:19.780 --> 03:37:21.262]  The military had him surrounded.
[03:37:21.262 --> 03:37:27.507]  They were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be watched carefully and looked after.
[03:37:27.507 --> 03:37:29.969]  NORAD standing down.
[03:37:29.969 --> 03:37:30.730]  Where were the planes?
[03:37:34.395 --> 03:37:37.457]  On now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11.
[03:37:37.457 --> 03:37:40.499]  A mysterious plane was seen flying right over the president's residence.
[03:37:40.499 --> 03:37:43.601]  The E-4Bs over New York and Washington.
[03:37:43.601 --> 03:37:45.783]  Otherwise known as the Doomsday Planes.
[03:37:45.783 --> 03:37:48.325]  It has never been officially explained.
[03:37:48.325 --> 03:37:53.268]  Cell phones working at impossible altitudes.
[03:37:53.268 --> 03:37:59.172]  Solicitor General Ted Olson receiving phone calls that the FBI says were never made.
[03:37:59.172 --> 03:38:00.353]  What happened during that call?
[03:38:00.353 --> 03:38:03.315]  This is the only information we have on these terrorists.
[03:38:05.422 --> 03:38:07.644]  She was able to call him twice.
[03:38:07.644 --> 03:38:10.366]  How she could pull that off, we don't know, but she did.
[03:38:10.366 --> 03:38:14.149]  These are the questions, Mr. President.
[03:38:14.149 --> 03:38:15.690]  These are the questions.
[03:38:15.690 --> 03:38:17.431]  They go on and on.
[03:38:17.431 --> 03:38:23.896]  Good afternoon, Mr. President.
[03:38:23.896 --> 03:38:32.462]  I come to you today representing the families of the victims of September 11th, as well as millions of my fellow Americans.
[03:38:32.462 --> 03:38:34.584]  Hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter
[03:38:35.342 --> 03:38:36.163]  We're good to go.
[03:38:58.203 --> 03:39:06.711]  The 9-11 Commission itself says they were lied to, deceived, and essentially prevented from carrying out a real investigation.
[03:39:06.711 --> 03:39:12.136]  The people of the United States and the world demand the truth, sir.
[03:39:12.136 --> 03:39:13.717]  We have to continuously ask questions.
[03:39:13.717 --> 03:39:14.578]  That's what a patriot does.
[03:39:14.578 --> 03:39:16.099]  That's what a true American does.
[03:39:16.099 --> 03:39:20.763]  We ask questions.
[03:39:20.763 --> 03:39:24.547]  You, sir, have the power as well as the responsibility
[03:39:25.236 --> 03:39:33.182]  To initiate a truly independent congressional investigation into the events of 9-11, as well as its aftermath.
[03:39:33.182 --> 03:39:35.424]  We want our country back, Mr. President.
[03:39:35.424 --> 03:39:44.632]  Therefore, I'm not just calling on you and your team, I'm calling on each and every American citizen to wake up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[03:39:44.632 --> 03:39:46.833]  We're counting on you, Mr. President.
[03:39:46.833 --> 03:39:52.378]  Be on the right side of history.
[03:39:52.378 --> 03:39:53.699]  And what did Thomas Jefferson say?
[03:39:55.674 --> 03:40:02.123]  What did he say the truest form of patriotism is?
[03:40:02.123 --> 03:40:04.286]  Dissent is the highest form of patriotism.
[03:40:04.286 --> 03:40:05.067]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:40:07.658 --> 03:40:11.582]  Are you now saying that they weren't asking to block an investigation?
[03:40:11.582 --> 03:40:18.708]  An investigation must not interfere with the ongoing efforts to prevent the next attack.
[03:40:18.708 --> 03:40:25.754]  Senator Tom Daschle said last week that you called him several times and urged him not to investigate the events of September 11th.
[03:40:25.754 --> 03:40:26.214]  Tom's wrong.
[03:40:26.214 --> 03:40:30.198]  He has, I think in this case, let's say a misinterpretation.
[03:40:32.916 --> 03:40:36.177]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, that's Charlie Sheen's video message to the President.
[03:40:36.177 --> 03:40:41.480]  You just heard him live for an hour on air.
[03:40:41.480 --> 03:40:47.122]  And all of this is possible because of the listeners, the sponsors, the Genesis Network, my crew here.
[03:40:47.122 --> 03:40:50.884]  I want to thank all of our sponsors.
[03:40:50.884 --> 03:40:56.646]  We skipped three of the breaks today, but those will be replaced.
[03:40:56.646 --> 03:40:57.967]  It's just amazing, and we really
[03:40:59.958 --> 03:41:11.224]  Our ancestors did this at many key junctures and many of them pay with their lives or their treasure or their names.
[03:41:11.224 --> 03:41:20.209]  All real men and women have to stand up against evil and corruption and I told you back on Monday before all this was launched that Tuesday was only the beginning.
[03:41:20.209 --> 03:41:20.909]  It's about making it
[03:41:23.365 --> 03:41:24.686]  A debate with the President.
[03:41:24.686 --> 03:41:27.509]  It's about making it an issue of putting it on the plate of the President.
[03:41:27.509 --> 03:41:30.973]  It's about forcing those 20 points out there to be looked at.
[03:41:30.973 --> 03:41:38.700]  And no doubt, hundreds of major newspapers and hundreds of blogs and thousands of websites have posted 20 Minutes with the President.
[03:41:38.700 --> 03:41:45.707]  Tens of millions conservatively, just three and a half, four days into this operation against the New World Order, have read 20 Minutes with the President.
[03:41:46.741 --> 03:41:50.043]  I asked people to pray for us as well and pray for Charlie and pray for myself.
[03:41:50.043 --> 03:41:53.364]  A lot of stuff going on behind the scenes that I won't even get into here.
[03:41:53.364 --> 03:41:55.985]  But we cheerfully take it all.
[03:41:55.985 --> 03:41:56.986]  You've seen history here.
[03:41:56.986 --> 03:41:59.007]  Black Ops tried to stir things up on Tuesday.
[03:41:59.007 --> 03:41:59.427]  Didn't work.
[03:42:00.506 --> 03:42:03.769]  And we rolled over that, thanks to all of you getting the word out.
[03:42:03.769 --> 03:42:06.492]  And now his video address the President is all over the web.
[03:42:06.492 --> 03:42:09.295]  Every major video site I looked at is the top video.
[03:42:09.295 --> 03:42:10.016]  It's just exploding.
[03:42:10.016 --> 03:42:12.478]  Go to InfoWars.com and be part of the fight.
[03:42:12.478 --> 03:42:16.562]  Click on the big banner at the top of InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:42:16.562 --> 03:42:18.224]  It says 20 minutes with the President.
[03:42:18.224 --> 03:42:21.127]  And it's got the 20 minutes with the President, the audio interviews, the video interviews.
[03:42:21.627 --> 03:42:25.989]  When he was live on the show a few days ago for 10 minutes, the hour-long interview will be posted there today.
[03:42:25.989 --> 03:42:33.393]  But most importantly, the video address to the President by Charlie Sheen with all those key facts you just heard and saw, posted right there at the top.
[03:42:33.393 --> 03:42:36.415]  Take that video and send it to your entire email list.
[03:42:36.415 --> 03:42:38.716]  Show it to your co-workers.
[03:42:38.716 --> 03:42:40.477]  Print off the URL and the article.
[03:42:40.477 --> 03:42:42.177]  Give it to people.
[03:42:42.177 --> 03:42:42.838]  And don't stop.
[03:42:42.838 --> 03:42:44.839]  You're watching this six months from now, a year from now.
[03:42:46.305 --> 03:42:47.966]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:42:47.966 --> 03:42:52.789]  We have no future if these terrorists that committed these attacks are able to continue to operate.
[03:42:52.789 --> 03:42:57.913]  All of you that serve this evil system and black ops, they're putting stuff in your water, they're putting stuff in your vaccines.
[03:42:57.913 --> 03:43:00.494]  This is a diabolical group of eugenicists.
[03:43:00.494 --> 03:43:12.182]  The White House science chief wrote the government textbook, Ecoscience, John P. Holdren, calling for sterilizing as poisoning as putting poisons in our water.
[03:43:12.182 --> 03:43:13.023]  This is real.
[03:43:13.023 --> 03:43:16.065]  Reality is so much wilder than most people can even imagine.
[03:43:17.478 --> 03:43:19.840]  And I just commend the courage of Charlie Sheen.
[03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:22.622]  He's an incredible person when you know him in person.
[03:43:22.622 --> 03:43:25.684]  And he's a great family man.
[03:43:25.684 --> 03:43:27.065]  Imagine, he became a famous movie star.
[03:43:27.065 --> 03:43:30.867]  He was like 16 in Red Dawn.
[03:43:30.867 --> 03:43:33.109]  All those big movies when he was 20, 21, 22.
[03:43:33.109 --> 03:43:40.794]  And all the media can do is focus on little petty things in his past.
[03:43:40.794 --> 03:43:44.436]  When it's well-known what goes on in Washington, dwarfs anything Sheen ever did.
[03:43:44.436 --> 03:43:45.397]  Or the exaggerations.
[03:43:45.397 --> 03:43:46.838]  He is an amazing person.
[03:43:47.854 --> 03:44:09.651]  And again, I know a lot of other big Hollywood people that I've run into over the years and I've consulted on films and been in a few films like Scanner Darkly, Waking Life, Winona Ryder, Woody Harrelson, Keanu Reeves, a lot of others I'm not going to mention even bigger because they've asked me not to.
[03:44:09.651 --> 03:44:14.435]  They don't have the courage that Charlie Sheen has and I'm not saying they're bad people.
[03:44:14.435 --> 03:44:15.536]  I'm just saying that
[03:44:17.301 --> 03:44:19.424]  Bruce Willis went public somewhat, but I'm gonna leave it at that.
[03:44:19.424 --> 03:44:28.476]  I'm gonna let Bruce... What Bruce really says he believes, I'm gonna just... He said the same people that killed Kennedy are running things now, and he no longer follows the phony Republicans or the Democrats.
[03:44:28.476 --> 03:44:34.563]  He had a paradigm shift, but... I challenge Bruce Willis to contact us and come on the show.
[03:44:34.563 --> 03:44:35.084]  I challenge...
[03:44:36.229 --> 03:44:37.431]  All these other people.
[03:44:37.431 --> 03:44:42.597]  And I challenge people in the media, and people in music, and people in entertainment to come public.
[03:44:42.597 --> 03:44:43.879]  They can't stop us all.
[03:44:43.879 --> 03:44:50.107]  And that's what the big announcement is, is that we're standing up with courage, we're taking action, and Charlie Sheen's asking for your help right now today.
[03:44:51.943 --> 03:45:03.512]  And instead of letting the media put out all their hit pieces, put out their disinfo, use the 9-11 staged attacks to set up more of a police state, to use Homeland Security against conservatives, gun owners, veterans, as they now admit they're doing.
[03:45:03.512 --> 03:45:05.013]  They built this whole police state.
[03:45:05.013 --> 03:45:08.496]  From day one, it was meant for the American people and the people of the world.
[03:45:08.496 --> 03:45:12.079]  Same systems are being set up worldwide.
[03:45:12.079 --> 03:45:14.000]  We're standing up and saying, we're not going along with this.
[03:45:14.000 --> 03:45:14.461]  We're done.
[03:45:16.738 --> 03:45:25.582]  We're saying that we understand the control grid that's being set up and we understand our children and grandchildren and their children have no future if we don't stop this scientific dictatorship.
[03:45:25.582 --> 03:45:28.683]  I'm going to take some phone calls now.
[03:45:28.683 --> 03:45:29.643]  Danny in Tennessee.
[03:45:29.643 --> 03:45:30.403]  Danny, you're on the air.
[03:45:30.403 --> 03:45:33.305]  Hi, Alex.
[03:45:33.305 --> 03:45:35.105]  Welcome.
[03:45:35.105 --> 03:45:41.568]  I just want to start off by saying thank you to Charlie Sheen for his great effort.
[03:45:41.568 --> 03:45:44.189]  And I know the great amount of courage it takes for him to do that.
[03:45:45.183 --> 03:45:46.424]  And, uh, it's been a while.
[03:45:46.424 --> 03:45:47.785]  You have no idea.
[03:45:47.785 --> 03:45:51.948]  The White House indicted Mark Cuban over even helping us.
[03:45:51.948 --> 03:45:53.769]  And then Mark Biet.
[03:45:53.769 --> 03:46:03.776]  I remember all those, I remember all those, uh, all those things happening, you know, as we've gone along, uh, trying to make progress and, you know, expose the truth.
[03:46:03.776 --> 03:46:04.677]  This is, you know, it's a war.
[03:46:04.677 --> 03:46:07.159]  I mean, do people realize what we're doing as leaders in this?
[03:46:08.285 --> 03:46:18.473]  I mean, we're in the arena with a 9-foot, 500-pound, vicious, fire-breathing gladiator of the New World Order.
[03:46:18.473 --> 03:46:28.481]  Yep, and I don't think a lot of people appreciate what you are doing, and people like Charlie, and all the other great leaders.
[03:46:28.481 --> 03:46:35.986]  But I want to also make a key point, and I want people to be thinking about it, because
[03:46:37.423 --> 03:46:41.285]  I want people to start realizing that we need to expose the Bilderbergs.
[03:46:41.285 --> 03:46:45.566]  And, you know, more people need to be focused on those people.
[03:46:45.566 --> 03:46:49.288]  Yeah, the real power elite, not just the puppets like Obama.
[03:46:49.288 --> 03:46:54.170]  And on the flu hype they're having and on the financial implosion, we try to cover it all.
[03:46:54.170 --> 03:46:59.252]  Those are the people that right now are probably, you know, looking at... In fact, bring in Game Inheritance on the table.
[03:46:59.252 --> 03:46:59.772]  Go ahead.
[03:46:59.772 --> 03:47:00.472]  No, you're absolutely right.
[03:47:00.472 --> 03:47:00.992]  Those are the people.
[03:47:00.992 --> 03:47:02.253]  Go ahead.
[03:47:02.253 --> 03:47:03.493]  Those are the people in my heart.
[03:47:03.493 --> 03:47:07.135]  I believe they're looking at everything we do and, you know, they know what's going on.
[03:47:08.106 --> 03:47:15.890]  And they're the ones that sit there and call the shots and say, you know, oh look, they're going after our puppet Obama, you know.
[03:47:15.890 --> 03:47:28.656]  You know, they come up with a plan, you know, they come up with a plan of action and, you know, that's why the media, they block for Obama and then Obama blocks for those people.
[03:47:28.656 --> 03:47:30.376]  That's right, I appreciate your call.
[03:47:30.376 --> 03:47:31.517]  Great football analogy.
[03:47:33.502 --> 03:47:39.226]  And what we put in this film two years ago is totally documented in the government's own textbook.
[03:47:39.226 --> 03:47:40.847]  Ecoscience.
[03:47:40.847 --> 03:47:41.427]  Absolutely.
[03:47:41.427 --> 03:47:43.049]  Good job, Danny, with those points.
[03:47:43.049 --> 03:47:43.949]  Tom in New Hampshire.
[03:47:43.949 --> 03:47:45.610]  Tom, you're on the air.
[03:47:45.610 --> 03:47:46.791]  Alex, it's great to be on with you.
[03:47:46.791 --> 03:47:48.612]  It's an honor.
[03:47:48.612 --> 03:47:49.393]  Honor to have you with us.
[03:47:49.393 --> 03:47:53.916]  Do you think this is the last chance for 9-11 truth to come through?
[03:47:53.916 --> 03:47:55.517]  No, we're never going to stop.
[03:47:55.517 --> 03:47:56.318]  We're never going to stop.
[03:47:56.318 --> 03:48:00.060]  They're running hit pieces on us daily because they're scared of us.
[03:48:00.060 --> 03:48:00.701]  But no, I mean,
[03:48:01.860 --> 03:48:06.004]  We do need to expose government-sponsored terror to take that tool away from them, but expose the flu.
[03:48:06.004 --> 03:48:08.907]  I mean, I was on air January saying everything that was going to happen.
[03:48:08.907 --> 03:48:13.872]  I understand their operation, but yes, we need to all stand up and get involved.
[03:48:13.872 --> 03:48:15.574]  Seems like a really important year.
[03:48:15.574 --> 03:48:20.019]  You know, you've got the economic collapse coming around the corner and then we could have dictatorship.
[03:48:20.376 --> 03:48:28.342]  And they meant to use 9-11 to get the police state in control so they can engineer the engineered collapse and use that police state on us.
[03:48:28.342 --> 03:48:30.164]  Yes, it is key.
[03:48:30.164 --> 03:48:39.471]  But now we've got all these mainline conservative talk show hosts talking about Obama, that queue up for me, Savage, saying the government may stage terror attacks or is going to do it.
[03:48:39.471 --> 03:48:41.073]  That idea is now out there.
[03:48:41.813 --> 03:48:44.995]  And we've caused a massive awakening thanks to everybody taking action.
[03:48:44.995 --> 03:48:46.936]  So the news here is we're engaging them.
[03:48:46.936 --> 03:48:48.116]  We're having an effect.
[03:48:48.116 --> 03:48:49.277]  We have power.
[03:48:49.277 --> 03:48:52.058]  That's my main message.
[03:48:52.058 --> 03:48:54.439]  Why do people in the media go along?
[03:48:54.439 --> 03:49:04.465]  Because they're whores and they have mortgages and they enjoy the power trips of being on TV and they haven't... They just are worldly.
[03:49:04.465 --> 03:49:05.305]  I appreciate your call.
[03:49:05.305 --> 03:49:06.546]  Really good points, Tom.
[03:49:06.546 --> 03:49:07.626]  Adrian in Rhode Island.
[03:49:07.626 --> 03:49:09.287]  Adrian, you're on the air.
[03:49:09.287 --> 03:49:09.767]  Hey, Alex.
[03:49:09.767 --> 03:49:10.368]  It's great to be on.
[03:49:12.498 --> 03:49:21.900]  I would be proud of most of your work, especially the way you fight back against, you know, the Orwellian perpetual state of war we have going on in this country, so thank you for that.
[03:49:21.900 --> 03:49:26.841]  That being said, though, I have to contribute a Jeffersonian patriotic defending voice here today.
[03:49:26.841 --> 03:49:36.143]  Just specifically, I've noticed in the last week, like, there have been a couple articles on your InfoWars site that have been a little bit intolerant of homosexuality, it seems.
[03:49:37.691 --> 03:49:39.151]  Well, sir, I appreciate your call.
[03:49:39.151 --> 03:49:52.755]  Look, I'm not up here with bashing people, hating people, but we posted articles about how they have the quote lesbian rangers in Canada who go around harassing heterosexuals and trying to bring in hate speech laws.
[03:49:52.755 --> 03:49:55.416]  So, that's what I'm against.
[03:49:55.416 --> 03:49:56.476]  Okay?
[03:49:56.476 --> 03:49:58.397]  I'm against guilds of people
[03:49:59.833 --> 03:50:23.133]  getting together and and I mean with the CPS they take heterosexual family homeschoolers kids on record and give it to the gay and lesbian families so I'm not saying all the gay people are involved in this but there are gangs of different gangs of people that's how humans arrange themselves and it's wrong and they shouldn't teach anything sexual to six or seven-year-olds in schools there's there's recruiting going on
[03:50:24.142 --> 03:50:29.045]  And just stay away from our kids, man, regardless, with any type of stuff.
[03:50:29.045 --> 03:50:32.526]  All this recruiting, all this agenda, okay?
[03:50:32.526 --> 03:50:39.270]  Gay folks don't have children, so they replicate by recruitment.
[03:50:39.270 --> 03:50:47.374]  And that's fine with consenting adults, but just, look, there's a lot of really bad stuff and out-of-control, self-destructive stuff.
[03:50:47.374 --> 03:50:52.177]  Gay men have the lowest life expectancy in the country, even below black men, who are next.
[03:50:53.084 --> 03:50:58.345]  I mean, it's, you know, I care about these people, but it's very destructive what's going on, okay?
[03:50:58.345 --> 03:51:01.786]  Very, very simple.
[03:51:01.786 --> 03:51:06.347]  There's a guy named MZ in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:51:06.347 --> 03:51:08.908]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:51:08.908 --> 03:51:18.370]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life, that even when you do a great job for someone, and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:51:18.370 --> 03:51:18.870]  We're good to go.
[03:51:37.456 --> 03:51:38.176]  We're good to go.
[03:52:02.472 --> 03:52:08.275]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.275 --> 03:52:15.858]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[03:52:15.858 --> 03:52:22.021]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:22.441 --> 03:52:24.423]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:24.423 --> 03:52:26.925]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:26.925 --> 03:52:38.515]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[03:52:38.515 --> 03:52:40.177]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:40.177 --> 03:52:42.038]  It's about a one-world government.
[03:52:42.038 --> 03:52:48.264]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.934 --> 03:52:57.210]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:57.210 --> 03:52:58.793]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.793 --> 03:52:59.975]  The people strike back!
[03:53:02.327 --> 03:53:11.314]  Did you know that millionaire, entrepreneur, businessman, and your congressional candidate, Robert Beatles, wrote a 72-page book on how to become wealthy?
[03:53:11.314 --> 03:53:15.697]  It doesn't matter if you are poor or wealthy, this book is for you!
[03:53:15.697 --> 03:53:21.101]  The book tells you how to create and protect your wealth, and it's called Here's What You Do.

[03:53:31.369 --> 03:53:32.610]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:53:32.610 --> 03:53:36.993]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[03:53:36.993 --> 03:53:42.977]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[03:53:42.977 --> 03:53:46.619]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:53:46.619 --> 03:53:49.341]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[03:53:49.341 --> 03:53:54.404]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[03:53:54.404 --> 03:53:54.705]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:53:54.705 --> 03:53:56.046]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[03:54:08.252 --> 03:54:12.414]  This is your chance to be part of this history-making event and to be on the right side of history.
[03:54:14.414 --> 03:54:15.754]  Go to Infowars.com.
[03:54:15.754 --> 03:54:17.375]  Get Charlie's address to the President.
[03:54:17.375 --> 03:54:18.996]  E-mail it out to everybody you know.
[03:54:18.996 --> 03:54:20.536]  Call the talk radio shows.
[03:54:20.536 --> 03:54:21.456]  Take our press releases.
[03:54:21.456 --> 03:54:22.317]  Get them out to everybody.
[03:54:22.317 --> 03:54:24.297]  This thing has gone mega-viral.
[03:54:24.297 --> 03:54:29.699]  This is probably double the size of the biggest thing I've ever done previously, and that was Charlie Sheen three years ago.
[03:54:29.699 --> 03:54:33.220]  And there was Willie Nelson, Jesse Ventura going public on this show.
[03:54:33.220 --> 03:54:34.481]  They chose this show to go public.
[03:54:36.107 --> 03:54:39.370]  And, you know, people are out there on the web making a big deal about it.
[03:54:39.370 --> 03:54:40.571]  Charlie Sheen goes to Washington.
[03:54:40.571 --> 03:54:43.014]  He has gone to Washington with his 20 points.
[03:54:43.014 --> 03:54:44.635]  That's on the White House desk.
[03:54:44.635 --> 03:54:45.456]  Gibbs has seen it.
[03:54:45.456 --> 03:54:46.717]  They admit it.
[03:54:46.717 --> 03:54:48.258]  No doubt they're aware of this.
[03:54:48.258 --> 03:54:49.580]  It's all over national news.
[03:54:50.868 --> 03:54:55.092]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, I commend everyone for the great job they did.
[03:54:55.092 --> 03:55:00.097]  You know, the last caller, sir, none of us are going to agree with each other on everything.
[03:55:00.097 --> 03:55:07.904]  I would imagine you don't agree with your mom or dad or your cousin on every issue, or your preacher, or your boss, or your employees.
[03:55:07.904 --> 03:55:10.707]  It isn't about us all agreeing with each other on every issue.
[03:55:10.707 --> 03:55:12.088]  We have staged terror attacks.
[03:55:12.088 --> 03:55:15.611]  We have $23.7 trillion stolen in the first 10 months of the bailout and growing.
[03:55:16.232 --> 03:55:18.174]  We have all these wars.
[03:55:18.174 --> 03:55:24.762]  Obama putting 50,000 contractors in, taking 50,000 troops out, sending them to Afghanistan, increasing the number of troops overall.
[03:55:24.762 --> 03:55:26.524]  We have him lying about everything.
[03:55:26.524 --> 03:55:28.447]  We have indefinite detention continuing.
[03:55:28.447 --> 03:55:30.770]  Northcombing turned loose on the American people.
[03:55:30.770 --> 03:55:31.991]  These are the issues.
[03:55:31.991 --> 03:55:34.274]  So, we can't be diverted or distracted.
[03:55:35.472 --> 03:55:37.933]  The COINTELPRO operatives want us to all fight with each other.
[03:55:37.933 --> 03:55:38.874]  I'm not saying you were that.
[03:55:38.874 --> 03:55:49.761]  I'm saying they use that natural tribalism over race and issues and sexual preference and income level and where you're from and where you live.
[03:55:49.761 --> 03:55:51.282]  It's stupid!
[03:55:51.282 --> 03:55:52.963]  And the globalists try to play on all that.
[03:55:52.963 --> 03:55:56.485]  We have a tiny elite waging war against humanity.
[03:55:57.423 --> 03:56:00.308]  And we've got to get up, stand up, and demand the truth.
[03:56:00.308 --> 03:56:03.152]  I'll have other big developments Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:56:03.152 --> 03:56:04.254]  here live.
[03:56:04.254 --> 03:56:06.378]  I'm finishing in the next week and a half for all the Republic.
[03:56:08.188 --> 03:56:10.589]  We are working around the clock to fight the New World Order.
[03:56:10.589 --> 03:56:12.690]  We're working around the clock to resist tyranny.
[03:56:12.690 --> 03:56:13.811]  We're doing everything we can.
[03:56:13.811 --> 03:56:14.991]  We're not perfect.
[03:56:14.991 --> 03:56:15.852]  We make mistakes.
[03:56:15.852 --> 03:56:17.692]  We don't get it 100% every time.
[03:56:17.692 --> 03:56:18.813]  But we're trying.
[03:56:18.813 --> 03:56:21.674]  It's that Teddy Roosevelt quote about, we're in the arena.
[03:56:21.674 --> 03:56:23.755]  Get in the arena and fight for your future.
[03:56:23.755 --> 03:56:26.877]  A global corporate takeover is happening, run by eugenicists.
[03:56:27.637 --> 03:56:30.118]  For the globalist, a world government's only the beginning.
[03:56:30.118 --> 03:56:33.820]  It's the means to the end for worldwide extermination, for the endgame.
[03:56:33.820 --> 03:56:35.320]  You heard Charlie Sheen talk about it.
[03:56:35.320 --> 03:56:37.501]  And all the media people tuned in right now.
[03:56:37.501 --> 03:56:41.383]  And all your little fractionalized, factionalized groups.
[03:56:41.383 --> 03:56:43.964]  You better wake up, stand up and demand the truth.
[03:56:43.964 --> 03:56:47.505]  You better get your thinking caps on and look at where our world's going.
[03:56:47.505 --> 03:56:55.088]  And look at your children tonight when you're home and ask, do you want to deliver them into the hands of this NORTHCOM Homeland Security Police State System?
[03:56:55.088 --> 03:56:56.809]  I mean, I've got mainstream news articles.
[03:56:57.509 --> 03:57:02.311]  Where the Girl Scouts have been hired by Homeland Security and FEMA?
[03:57:02.311 --> 03:57:04.912]  Mainstream news?
[03:57:04.912 --> 03:57:08.874]  Pull that up about Girl Scouts to work for Homeland Security, AP, Reuters.
[03:57:08.874 --> 03:57:13.576]  And it says to look for terrorists, to help their families, to watch their families.
[03:57:13.576 --> 03:57:15.556]  And they want national compulsory service.
[03:57:15.556 --> 03:57:18.238]  That's what the beginning of Obama with the milquetoast speech.
[03:57:18.238 --> 03:57:23.360]  Getting the kids used to lining up in front of the big TV screens like 1984 and getting their marching orders.
[03:57:23.360 --> 03:57:26.181]  Obama's continuing everything Bush did under phony left cover.
[03:57:27.538 --> 03:57:30.559]  Shatter the left-right paradigm.
[03:57:30.559 --> 03:57:32.639]  Expose the bankers in the Fed.
[03:57:32.639 --> 03:57:34.680]  If we don't do this, it's over.
[03:57:34.680 --> 03:57:40.801]  I've been the most successful at fighting the New World Order of anybody on the planet, except for maybe Ron Paul, because I've understood how their system works.
[03:57:40.801 --> 03:57:42.421]  I've understood how they operate.
[03:57:42.421 --> 03:57:50.103]  And I've taught people and led by example for folks to learn how to stand up and to take on the globalist.
[03:57:51.161 --> 03:57:52.443]  This is serious.
[03:57:52.443 --> 03:57:53.023]  This is real.
[03:57:53.023 --> 03:57:56.848]  They're imploding the economy to make you be driven into the arms of the government.
[03:57:56.848 --> 03:57:59.070]  To make you be dependent on them.
[03:57:59.070 --> 03:58:00.452]  They don't want you to have a good life.
[03:58:00.452 --> 03:58:02.254]  They want to force vaccinations on you.
[03:58:02.254 --> 03:58:08.060]  They want to set precedents to have a medical, military, industrial complex prison we all live in.
[03:58:09.127 --> 03:58:10.608]  That's it for this amazing transmission.
[03:58:10.608 --> 03:58:11.888]  It was a totally jam-packed show.
[03:58:11.888 --> 03:58:13.929]  I won't even tell you about all the financial news.
[03:58:13.929 --> 03:58:14.710]  All of it we covered.
[03:58:14.710 --> 03:58:19.052]  What's happening with the Potomac situation and the D.C.
[03:58:19.052 --> 03:58:22.874]  New York flyovers and all the crazy stuff happening right now.
[03:58:22.874 --> 03:58:26.256]  The globalists are getting ready to launch terror attacks, I'm telling you, unless we get the word out.
[03:58:26.636 --> 03:58:27.297]  Preemptively.
[03:58:27.297 --> 03:58:29.339]  I saw them re-invoking 9-11.
[03:58:29.339 --> 03:58:31.961]  That's a key tell-tale sign that we're getting ready to launch an op.
[03:58:31.961 --> 03:58:33.843]  We're countering it and risking our lives.
[03:58:33.843 --> 03:58:34.684]  God bless you all.
[03:58:34.684 --> 03:58:35.765]  God bless the crew.
[03:58:35.765 --> 03:58:37.266]  God bless Charlie Sheen.
[03:58:37.266 --> 03:58:38.948]  See you back live Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:58:38.948 --> 03:58:40.149]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:40.149 --> 03:58:43.172]  InfoWars.com.
[03:58:43.172 --> 03:58:45.073]  The war is now, folks.
[03:58:45.073 --> 03:58:46.595]  It's happening now.
[03:58:46.595 --> 03:58:48.517]  Stand up for yourselves now.
[03:58:48.517 --> 03:58:49.297]  It's happening now.
[03:58:51.374 --> 03:58:55.618]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[03:58:55.618 --> 03:58:57.620]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[03:58:57.620 --> 03:59:06.149]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals and pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[03:59:06.149 --> 03:59:11.694]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases.
[03:59:11.694 --> 03:59:13.316]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[03:59:13.536 --> 03:59:20.057]  The Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and your family's drinking water.
[03:59:20.057 --> 03:59:31.100]  The Ecola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere, and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultraviolet light sterilization techniques.
[03:59:31.100 --> 03:59:31.880]  That's right.
[03:59:31.880 --> 03:59:34.440]  Clean water, right from the air you breathe.
[03:59:34.440 --> 03:59:36.021]  Order today by calling 1-800-691-8255.
[03:59:37.861 --> 03:59:41.842]  Direct to you, and in your face, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
