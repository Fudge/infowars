[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:20.720]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:20.720 --> 00:37.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday, the 24th day
[00:37.520 --> 00:45.240]  of January 2013 transmission. Feinstein had published on her Senate website a month ago
[00:45.240 --> 00:50.720]  or more the bill and people said there's no way she's actually gonna introduce this. They'd
[00:50.720 --> 00:56.480]  introduced copycats of her bill, so technically she hadn't introduced it a few weeks ago.
[00:56.480 --> 01:00.200]  But it was the same bill introduced by others, which they may try to sneak through when people
[01:00.200 --> 01:05.780]  target her bill. But she has now officially today introduced it, had the press conference,
[01:05.780 --> 01:10.200]  we watched it. We're dumping down the full video clip right now so we can play clips
[01:10.200 --> 01:11.200]  later.
[01:11.200 --> 01:14.760]  She just concluded about, I don't know, an hour ago or so. Here's some of the headlines
[01:14.760 --> 01:19.880]  that are up at drudgereport.com. We're also getting some of this news over to infowars.com
[01:19.880 --> 01:26.080]  and prisonplanet.com. In fact, can you guys punch up Drudge for me? Fantastic, let me
[01:26.080 --> 01:32.040]  punch that up then so folks can get that.
[01:32.040 --> 01:40.600]  Or you can punch it up in there. Dems target 150 weapons, seek national registry. So they
[01:40.600 --> 01:47.120]  wanna ban 150 handguns, rifles, they admit they're targeting everything. And the purpose
[01:47.120 --> 01:52.480]  is to dry up the supply of these weapons over time. So there you go, outright move to ban
[01:52.480 --> 01:54.480]  them over time, at least at admission.
[01:54.480 --> 01:59.440]  Feinstein got special permission to display guns in DC, cuz he's trying to take them from
[01:59.440 --> 02:04.880]  the rest of the country. And NRA boycott kills nation's largest outdoor show that had been
[02:04.880 --> 02:09.960]  going along with the gun grabbing. And that's the way to handle these people. You've gotta
[02:09.960 --> 02:15.040]  start boycotting Time Warner, because they're not letting gun ads for gun shops run on any
[02:15.040 --> 02:16.040]  other systems.
[02:16.040 --> 02:20.840]  While they put out some of those violent movies out there like the new movie coming out, Bullet
[02:20.840 --> 02:28.680]  to the Head with foe tough guy, Sylvester Stallone. I shouldn't say foe tough guy, I
[02:28.680 --> 02:32.460]  don't know if he's a tough guy or not. The point is, is that in the movies, his movies
[02:32.460 --> 02:38.300]  are ridiculous and just totally unrealistic, but that's a side issue.
[02:38.300 --> 02:44.520]  Guns ban targets, handguns and rifles, and that is in her official bill. Yeah, no, no,
[02:44.520 --> 02:50.560]  it goes after shotguns that are pump, that hold four rounds. I mean, it just goes after
[02:50.560 --> 02:57.260]  everything. In fact, it's worse than the original bill that she put up on her Senate website.
[02:57.260 --> 03:03.400]  It's worse than the bill she introduced in 1993. It is unprecedented, and remember what
[03:03.400 --> 03:04.400]  happened yesterday.
[03:04.400 --> 03:08.320]  In fact, I'm gonna re-pull that article out of yesterday's stack, cuz I didn't get to
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.400]  it properly. Kurt Nemo wrote about it and linked to the Australian newspapers. They've
[03:12.400 --> 03:17.640]  banned everything down to bolt action and single shot, and now they want those bans
[03:17.640 --> 03:19.680]  saying you have no reason to have these.
[03:19.680 --> 03:24.440]  So first they take the full auto, then they take the semi-auto. Come on, none of us wanna
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.360]  take your guns, just turn in the semi-auto and we'll leave your other guns alone. And
[03:28.360 --> 03:33.320]  then they ban, of course, those. So that is now happening saying, hey, you could have
[03:33.320 --> 03:35.360]  a school shooting with a bolt action.
[03:35.360 --> 03:40.200]  Well, yeah, and a meteorite could hit a school, or a 747 could crash in a school, or a school
[03:40.200 --> 03:44.000]  teacher could molest children, as we see more news out today. Does that mean you're gonna
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.400]  ban school teachers? We're not all collectively guilty because you've got a bunch of wound
[03:49.400 --> 03:55.540]  up Prozac heads out there and people with all sorts of neurological disorders from vaccine
[03:55.540 --> 03:58.680]  damage more and more being linked to an upsurge in mental illness.
[03:58.680 --> 04:03.600]  But overall crime is dropping because gun ownership is up. And we did file the statistics
[04:03.600 --> 04:11.700]  from FBI.gov, locally compiled, 49% in the last 20 years in overall violent crime dropping.
[04:11.700 --> 04:15.240]  Gun violence is actually even higher, it was better than I even said. So I was just looking
[04:15.240 --> 04:21.200]  at the basic numbers and dead reckoning them, they're very complex. And 21% as I dead reckoned
[04:21.200 --> 04:24.680]  that was accurate since 2007.
[04:24.680 --> 04:32.080]  So the the drop in crime is accelerating, accelerating. That's violent crime and crime
[04:32.080 --> 04:38.200]  with guns. People robbing your house when you're not there, people busting out your
[04:38.200 --> 04:42.400]  windows robbing your stereo, people stealing bikes out of your yard, petty stuff where
[04:42.400 --> 04:44.360]  they don't get their butt shot off.
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.200]  That is increasing dramatically. All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen,
[04:49.200 --> 04:53.440]  on the other side of this quick break. Stay with us, big transmission, Piers Morgan's

[07:02.000 --> 07:08.120]  lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The
[07:08.120 --> 07:13.760]  globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[07:13.760 --> 07:17.900]  to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness

[08:02.600 --> 08:30.720]  information war, it's Alex Jones. Well, the Republican establishment is starting to wake
[08:30.720 --> 08:42.800]  up and realize what is happening in this society. In fact, Rush Limbaugh has come out and pointed
[08:42.800 --> 08:48.640]  out that Obama is trying to cause culture wars, financial wars, and race wars. And that's
[08:48.640 --> 08:53.360]  exactly what Obama is trying to do.
[08:53.360 --> 08:59.320]  And if constitutionalist, if libertarians, if liberals, if conservatives, if whatever
[08:59.320 --> 09:07.160]  you call yourself, if you wanna have a free and open and happy, successful society, then
[09:07.160 --> 09:15.680]  you desperately need to understand we have diabolical people in control of our country.
[09:15.680 --> 09:21.260]  And not coming at it from the understanding that these are larcenous individuals that
[09:21.260 --> 09:28.520]  wanna bankrupt the nation and domesticate the population, collectivize the population.
[09:28.520 --> 09:34.120]  And then say that anyone, I mean, I have a Daily Beast article here, Piers pressure is
[09:34.120 --> 09:37.440]  what it's called, where they admit, yeah, we're going under global government, we're
[09:37.440 --> 09:41.680]  going under globalism, and it's good to put it in our face that the communist Chinese
[09:41.680 --> 09:43.420]  are telling us what to do.
[09:43.420 --> 09:48.040]  And it's good that our debt is owned by foreigners and it's good that Piers Morgan's a foreigner
[09:48.040 --> 09:52.440]  and let Alex Jones try to fight us, we're gonna deal with him. And I read the quotes
[09:52.440 --> 09:57.840]  yesterday and they went on to say, it's not just gonna be the blacks and browns against
[09:57.840 --> 10:03.520]  the whites, it's not just gonna be the women against the whites, it's gonna be the government
[10:03.520 --> 10:05.840]  and it's gonna be foreign governments helping us.
[10:05.840 --> 10:13.040]  And it's like the weatherman wrote it or something, those weatherman testimonies that came out,
[10:13.040 --> 10:17.240]  we played the video clips here that came out in the trials about how they would use foreign
[10:17.240 --> 10:23.160]  governments to come in and use ethnic uprisings to bring in a communist state in America.
[10:23.160 --> 10:29.160]  And even I have trouble believing they're actually trying this. And again, the public
[10:29.160 --> 10:34.600]  is so dumbed down out there generally, politically correct, whites, you name it, that even when
[10:34.600 --> 10:38.360]  they're on MSNBC saying we've got to deal with white people.
[10:38.360 --> 10:47.660]  And even when we see moves out there by people like Rangel saying, we've got to overcome
[10:47.660 --> 10:52.080]  the Constitution, that's a quote, we've got the video, you've seen it, posted it on Infowars.com
[10:52.080 --> 10:59.800]  two days ago. We've got to overcome the Constitution, we've got to overcome Southerners. Now again,
[10:59.800 --> 11:02.520]  that's more divide and conquer, play the North off against the South.
[11:02.520 --> 11:09.560]  They're trying to re-upload the 1860s and Obama used to be Abraham Lincoln. And that's
[11:09.560 --> 11:13.520]  why they say, you don't like socialist healthcare, you're a racist. That's why they come out
[11:13.520 --> 11:18.080]  and say, you won't turn your guns and you're a racist. What does that have to do with race?
[11:18.080 --> 11:24.880]  They go, shut up, racist. And again, there are black people all over this country that
[11:24.880 --> 11:28.360]  have guns to protect themselves. There are people in California, there are people in
[11:28.360 --> 11:32.800]  Michigan, there are people in Florida, I mean, people are people.
[11:32.800 --> 11:37.520]  And gun crimes, crimes using guns has gone way down, it's the FBI's numbers. Overall
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.120]  violent crime in the last 20 years, 49%, we showed you those numbers yesterday from FBI.gov
[11:43.120 --> 11:48.120]  and have a video posted at infowars.com for radio listeners, you can go watch it right
[11:48.120 --> 11:49.120]  now.
[11:49.120 --> 11:52.360]  They are desperate to cover all this up and just get us all fighting with each other.
[11:52.360 --> 11:57.560]  Women against the men, Hispanics against whites, whites against Hispanics, black against white,
[11:57.560 --> 12:02.440]  white against black, Protestant against Catholic. While these mega banks, these globalists,
[12:02.440 --> 12:07.880]  these collectivizers are busy bankrupting the country and sucking us dry. And it is
[12:07.880 --> 12:20.040]  outrageous to every day see Fox Sports, CNN, MSNBC, I mean, I saw headlines yesterday.
[12:20.040 --> 12:26.240]  Gun owners are the new Nazis, gun owners are Hitler. We defeated Hitler last week, CBS
[12:26.240 --> 12:34.220]  News, Bob Shafer, we can defeat gun owners. I mean, it is now 100% clear that my analysis
[12:34.220 --> 12:37.060]  over the last decade is spot on.
[12:37.060 --> 12:49.160]  And the whole homeland security grid is designed and set up for the American people. The whole
[12:49.160 --> 13:00.800]  thing is set up and designed and timed to unfurl this economic collapse to domesticate
[13:00.800 --> 13:05.400]  as many people as they can and get you dependent. And tell you it's good to be dependent, ship
[13:05.400 --> 13:09.440]  your jobs overseas and put taxes on American businesses so they can't operate unless they're
[13:09.440 --> 13:11.440]  select insiders.
[13:11.440 --> 13:16.320]  And then as the crime rate increases, it's been going down but they know during a collapse
[13:16.320 --> 13:20.520]  they'll start going back up. They're going to demonize and are already demonizing people
[13:20.520 --> 13:26.680]  that maintain law and order in their areas with firearms. And it's so crazy, I have an
[13:26.680 --> 13:30.080]  article here, I actually bought this two weeks ago for my son, he hasn't put it together
[13:30.080 --> 13:35.600]  yet, the Star Wars Jabba the Hutt Palace Lego set.
[13:35.600 --> 13:41.440]  And the Austrian government is looking at banning the toy set. And the Turkish Association
[13:41.440 --> 13:47.160]  there is calling for it, calling for apologies from Lego. And I guess George Lucas on top
[13:47.160 --> 13:52.080]  of it, saying Jabba the Hutt is supposed to be an Arab. And because the desert building
[13:52.080 --> 13:57.440]  has a dome, that it's bashing Arabs when actually that mosque is a Christian church.
[13:57.440 --> 14:01.640]  It doesn't even look much like it. This is the type of crazy political correctness. We
[14:01.640 --> 14:08.760]  had a video the other day that Mike Adams did about, we don't want kings, we got rid
[14:08.760 --> 14:16.600]  of King George III. And I saw comments by black people who were serious, because I went
[14:16.600 --> 14:19.200]  to their YouTube channels and looked.
[14:19.200 --> 14:24.680]  Saying why are you bashing Dr. Martin Luther King on Dr. Martin Luther King Day on Monday
[14:24.680 --> 14:31.160]  by saying, we don't want any more kings, we got rid of King George. The thinking the word
[14:31.160 --> 14:37.840]  king was a code word for Martin Luther King. When actually Mike Adams talked about how
[14:37.840 --> 14:41.480]  Martin Luther King wouldn't support Obama and his torture and wars.
[14:41.480 --> 14:47.520]  And Martin Luther King went out to get a gun permit to protect himself, that's on record.
[14:47.520 --> 14:51.840]  We actually had pro Martin Luther King stuff on the show that day. But see, it's like a
[14:51.840 --> 14:57.520]  mental illness where you're gonna be put off guard and off balance. You said you didn't
[14:57.520 --> 15:03.200]  like King George, perhaps code word for Martin Luther King?
[15:03.200 --> 15:07.960]  And then there was a whole debate in that video on YouTube from the radio show of them
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.020]  debating whether Mike Adams was a bad guy or not. And that type of mental illness really
[15:13.020 --> 15:18.600]  hurts me, because I want those people to be free. I mean, black communities are being
[15:18.600 --> 15:23.360]  targeted by eugenics, by the drugs being shipped in, by their leaders trying to collectivize
[15:23.360 --> 15:24.360]  them.
[15:24.360 --> 15:29.920]  By all these things, and you can't get through because it's all racism pumped in by the media
[15:29.920 --> 15:35.880]  and their leaders and others to create division in the name of unity. And then they tag on
[15:35.880 --> 15:41.320]  the agenda, support gun control, support socialism, support corporate fascism, support police
[15:41.320 --> 15:44.280]  state, support control, or you're a racist.
[15:44.280 --> 15:49.360]  And you're like, explain to me how not turning my guns in is racist. And they go, shut up
[15:49.360 --> 15:54.520]  racist. And the media just says it and says it, and then everywhere. We went out and interviewed
[15:54.520 --> 16:01.080]  people at UT, and I said, did you find them? They said, no, every woman we talked to, cuz
[16:01.080 --> 16:05.440]  they show a couple of them that piece we heard yesterday, says, the South is racist and bad,
[16:05.440 --> 16:06.440]  turn your guns in.
[16:06.440 --> 16:10.280]  And these are white women, and they said it with pleasure. They go, the South is bad,
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.320]  which is a code word for white people. And you just don't need guns, and that time is
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.120]  now. I mean, totally disconnected from reality. Going to the University of Texas, guaranteed
[16:19.120 --> 16:22.580]  you got middle class parents that buy into all this.
[16:22.580 --> 16:28.000]  No idea what's happening worldwide, no idea about the new world order. Everywhere I go,
[16:28.000 --> 16:33.720]  I'm scum because I'm a Texan. Piers Morgan wrote an article saying Texans are animals.
[16:33.720 --> 16:40.420]  And how I have the paw, the giant paw of a gorilla. And how I'm like a gorilla that is
[16:40.420 --> 16:46.840]  at the zoo at feeding time. And Texans are dumb gorillas and all this. Texans are dumb
[16:46.840 --> 16:48.920]  gorillas, Southerners are trash.
[16:48.920 --> 16:55.280]  White people are all racist, gun owners are racist, gun owners are Nazis. Meanwhile, Planned
[16:55.280 --> 17:02.320]  Parenthood's main job was founded to, quote, kill black people, to kill black weeds. And
[17:02.320 --> 17:06.400]  I'm like, hey, I don't want you to abort your kids. I wanna try to have them free and strong.
[17:06.400 --> 17:10.960]  Shut up, racist. You're like, I understand it's fun to say that. Just you're just trying
[17:10.960 --> 17:16.280]  to prove you're not a racist. We know you're a racist. It's a total mental illness.
[17:16.280 --> 17:21.600]  And it is cultural programming. And the Democrats up there, the old white people, they're the
[17:21.600 --> 17:28.180]  buddies of the, quote, minorities. And they're gonna get rid of the borders for you, and
[17:28.180 --> 17:31.600]  they're gonna get you free welfare. And they're gonna take those guns, and they're gonna get
[17:31.600 --> 17:33.080]  whitey for you.
[17:33.080 --> 17:38.600]  I mean, it is nothing but them playing us off like two different Indian tribes, two
[17:38.600 --> 17:46.040]  different Native American tribes. Early on, the natives outnumbered settlers at some points
[17:46.040 --> 17:52.200]  100,000 to 1. There's like 15 settlers and estimated however many natives on the continent.
[17:52.200 --> 17:56.120]  But during some of the biggest Indian wars, 10 to 1, 20 to 1, 30 to 1.
[17:56.120 --> 18:01.100]  But it wasn't even the superiority of arms cuz there were the French and others constantly
[18:01.100 --> 18:06.000]  always selling armaments to the natives who were very proficient with them very quickly.
[18:06.000 --> 18:10.780]  It was that the natives were always fighting with each other. And well, they live across
[18:10.780 --> 18:15.620]  that river. They all look the same, act the same, and they're basically the same culture.
[18:15.620 --> 18:20.660]  But it didn't matter because the British intelligence and others could come in and manipulate them
[18:20.660 --> 18:21.760]  off against each other.
[18:21.760 --> 18:24.640]  And the French tried it. It's called the great game. Who can do it the best? The Spanish
[18:24.640 --> 18:28.680]  tried it. They weren't as good. The British were the best at it, so they took over the
[18:28.680 --> 18:36.440]  world. That's why global imperial, imperial measurement, imperial language is English.
[18:36.440 --> 18:43.560]  The global imperial language is English. That's the global language. It's called imperial
[18:43.560 --> 18:49.520]  in establishment textbooks. I speak imperial. Most of you speak imperial. And the point
[18:49.520 --> 18:53.320]  is they don't want other people coming in from Mexico to ever speak imperial cuz they
[18:53.320 --> 18:59.040]  don't even want you able to communicate in the culture. They want you under their control.
[18:59.040 --> 19:06.060]  So we come down to this point now, ladies and gentlemen, where the Democrats have introduced
[19:06.060 --> 19:10.660]  a bill worse than what she posted on her Senate website, worse than copies of her other bill
[19:10.660 --> 19:15.440]  that she had before that other Democrats introduced, hoping that we miss those and they pass as
[19:15.440 --> 19:22.640]  riders on larger bills that bans all semi-automatic handguns, most pump shotguns.
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.840]  It's worse than what her other bill said. Dem set sights on 150 weapons seek national
[19:28.840 --> 19:35.640]  registry, open press conference with prayer. Purpose is to dry up the supply of these weapons
[19:35.640 --> 19:42.680]  over time. Feinstein got special permission to display guns in DC NRA boycott, kills nation's
[19:42.680 --> 19:50.560]  largest outdoor show. Now remember, remember they're talking about banning a Lego toy cuz
[19:50.560 --> 19:56.800]  the Arabs say Jabba the Hutt's supposed to be them. I mean, that's like saying ban a
[19:56.800 --> 20:00.600]  tree cuz you're saying Arabs look like it. I mean, it's just.

[21:11.680 --> 21:17.520]  2010 I got a lesson of my own about RNA drops. I learned that there are millions of gene
[21:17.520 --> 21:22.040]  switches latent in every single cell of my body that are waiting for an activator. I
[21:22.040 --> 21:26.960]  learned by taking RNA drops I could begin to activate that power in my cells and achieve

[24:14.840 --> 24:18.720]  others are warning that what should be listed as one of the biggest apocalyptic threats
[24:18.720 --> 24:24.120]  is not terrorists blowing up a bus and killing 10 people, which turn out to be staged to
[24:24.120 --> 24:29.880]  begin with. But antibiotic resistant bacteria, and there's a London Guardian report on that
[24:29.880 --> 24:35.040]  I'm gonna be getting to a little bit later.
[24:35.040 --> 24:40.320]  But what needs to be realized here is that over 100,000, some numbers are as high as
[24:40.320 --> 24:45.580]  200,000 people die from infections that were preventable in hospitals. Are you seeing a
[24:45.580 --> 24:52.240]  bunch of, five year old Billy died riddled with sores as the bacteria ate the flesh off
[24:52.240 --> 24:59.880]  his body. And he went into a coma over two weeks and died. Tom Daschle or somebody like
[24:59.880 --> 25:05.080]  Joe Biden, former and current politicians running around crying, they decide when to
[25:05.080 --> 25:06.520]  punch the buttons.
[25:06.520 --> 25:17.200]  They decide. And now we've got a press conference being opened by the Democrats saying, I believe
[25:17.200 --> 25:23.160]  the gun lobby is no match for the cross lobby. And we're getting a full press conference,
[25:23.160 --> 25:30.440]  it is unbelievably disgusting. And in there, they have forced buyback provisions. She lies
[25:30.440 --> 25:32.800]  and says, we're not gonna take guns from anybody.
[25:32.800 --> 25:36.640]  They always register, you have to come in and get them registered, they always confiscate.
[25:36.640 --> 25:41.680]  It's been done in Europe, it's been done in Australia. Australia is down to bolt action
[25:41.680 --> 25:46.600]  and single shot, and it is in their official newspapers. You can just type in Australia,
[25:46.600 --> 25:51.160]  get to ban bolt action, and you will pull up the mainstream articles.
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.200]  We covered it yesterday. So it's always the same pattern. England did the same deal. And
[25:56.200 --> 26:00.420]  then they say, okay, you can keep the bolt action. It's gotta be checked in at a local
[26:00.420 --> 26:07.720]  shooting club with police there, paid off duty when you shoot. And then they just ban
[26:07.720 --> 26:08.840]  the hunting clubs.
[26:08.840 --> 26:14.880]  Now they're banning those clubs. So this is how they totally eradicate them. And several
[26:14.880 --> 26:19.520]  countries in South America are doing this where they're banning hunting and guns. So
[26:19.520 --> 26:23.620]  they want it all gone. They try to make it about hunting, which it isn't, but they understand
[26:23.620 --> 26:24.620]  that's part of the culture.
[26:24.620 --> 26:29.080]  So they wanna kill that too. In fact, you think you're gonna hunt foxes that are breeding
[26:29.080 --> 26:34.600]  like rats? That's why they have fox hunting. With your beagles and your other fox hounds,
[26:34.600 --> 26:38.280]  you think you're gonna ride out in the country and have your dogs hunt like they're supposed
[26:38.280 --> 26:39.280]  to?
[26:39.280 --> 26:43.840]  So the foxes don't kill your cat. Paul Watson lives outside London. There are foxes running
[26:43.840 --> 26:48.540]  around. He sent me photos of them. I've retweeted them at Real Alex Jones, just like roaches.
[26:48.540 --> 26:53.320]  And they're vicious. Foxes have come in and killed babies and things. They're in the dog
[26:53.320 --> 26:57.440]  family at about five times more vicious per pound.
[26:57.440 --> 27:03.760]  And can't hunt them, so they're like roaches now all over the UK. Beautiful animals, but
[27:03.760 --> 27:09.720]  they are like roaches. See, all the ancients knew what to hunt. You didn't hunt big, beautiful
[27:09.720 --> 27:13.560]  animals. You hunted things that would get out of control if you didn't hunt them.
[27:13.560 --> 27:17.200]  Like take here in Austin, we have whitetail deer getting run over everywhere, eating in
[27:17.200 --> 27:22.840]  the yard, starving to death. I mean, I can barely drive home during the day or at night.
[27:22.840 --> 27:26.880]  Just deer everywhere, I see them hit everywhere I go. But you're not allowed to hunt them
[27:26.880 --> 27:28.880]  inside the city.
[27:28.880 --> 27:33.520]  And sometimes they'll pay people like $3,000, $4,000 apiece to cage them and then fly them
[27:33.520 --> 27:39.520]  to West Texas. And then they get out in West Texas with wolves and mountain lions, half
[27:39.520 --> 27:44.120]  starved, they're domesticated, they get killed in hours. Thousands of dollars to fly mountain
[27:44.120 --> 27:51.360]  lions free meals in helicopters, cuz you don't want them to die on a long truck ride.
[27:51.360 --> 27:56.580]  So you fly them in a helicopter, half the time they die of having a heart attack. I'm
[27:56.580 --> 28:02.320]  not kidding, they've had cases of up to $5,000. These yuppies will pay to have deer trapped
[28:02.320 --> 28:07.240]  in their yards, put in big cages, they go in to get food.
[28:07.240 --> 28:10.460]  And then they, see I'm already ranting, I haven't even gotten to it yet. Let's play
[28:10.460 --> 28:16.200]  a clip of Feinstein saying we wanna dry up the supply of the quote assault weapons, which
[28:16.200 --> 28:24.720]  is now your handgun. Here it is. Diane Feinstein in her press conference today, here's that
[28:24.720 --> 28:25.720]  clip.
[28:25.720 --> 28:32.420]  Hunting rights, we have tried to recognize legal defense rights. We have tried to recognize
[28:32.420 --> 28:41.120]  the right of a citizen to legally possess a weapon. No weapon is taken from anyone.
[28:41.120 --> 28:48.640]  The purpose is to dry up the supply of these weapons over time. Therefore, there is no
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.400]  sunset on this bill.
[28:53.400 --> 28:59.580]  There you go, there is no sunset on this bill and she literally smacks her lips with pleasure.
[28:59.580 --> 29:03.760]  That is an insider trader, one of the top insider traders in Congress. When they got
[29:03.760 --> 29:10.040]  caught, as you know, last year, they did a gangster trick on you, a mafia trick, a lawyer
[29:10.040 --> 29:11.040]  trick, it's on record.
[29:11.040 --> 29:15.100]  They said, it's not against the law for us to do it, which it actually was. We've done
[29:15.100 --> 29:21.280]  whole reports on that. We'll pass a law making it illegal. And the law actually made it legal,
[29:21.280 --> 29:26.560]  it's not constitutional. Where if the Ethics Committee of the House or Senate run by the
[29:26.560 --> 29:32.520]  insider traders says it's okay, that it is. It's like, we got caught murdering, well murder
[29:32.520 --> 29:36.480]  is not illegal for us, we'll pass a law making it illegal. And then the law says, well, we
[29:36.480 --> 29:39.840]  can kill somebody if the Ethics Committee says it's okay.
[29:39.840 --> 29:46.040]  I mean, that's the games that this big swollen, pus-filled pig of a woman, this tyrant is
[29:46.040 --> 29:49.800]  engaged in. We'll be right back, stay with us.
[29:49.800 --> 29:56.800]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:19.800 --> 30:26.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:49.800 --> 30:56.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[31:19.800 --> 31:26.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[31:49.800 --> 31:56.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[32:19.800 --> 32:26.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[32:49.800 --> 32:56.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[33:19.800 --> 33:27.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[33:49.800 --> 33:57.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[34:19.800 --> 34:24.800]  How can you say that didn't make me sick? The biggest thing going against the flu shot
[34:24.800 --> 34:29.800]  is a mom gives their five year old a shot and the kid swells up and has a convulsion.
[34:29.800 --> 34:34.800]  That'll cure you of vaccines for the rest of your life. The biggest thing going against
[34:34.800 --> 34:38.800]  the flu shots is my mother was, I don't know, it was like 10, 15 years ago, I forget, was
[34:38.800 --> 34:42.800]  really into triathlons at the time and doing a great job even winning silver medals and
[34:42.800 --> 34:51.800]  stuff at some big ones in her age group. And she was advised by the team coach, the local
[34:51.800 --> 34:56.800]  sponsored group, going to be in this big state triathlon, take the flu shot a month before
[34:56.800 --> 34:57.800]  because it's in the winter.
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.800]  You don't want this to knock you out. And herself and some of the others got sick. And
[35:02.800 --> 35:06.800]  I mean, my mother was sick for a month and she never gets sick like that. And this is
[35:06.800 --> 35:11.800]  like hospital level bad. She didn't go to the hospital, but she was down. And we're
[35:11.800 --> 35:16.800]  talking like a day after she took it. My uncle, my dad's brother, almost died when he was,
[35:16.800 --> 35:21.800]  I think, seven years old from a tetanus shot, swole up, had to go to the hospital.
[35:21.800 --> 35:28.800]  So the biggest thing running against him is cause and effect. To the point of now, before
[35:28.800 --> 35:32.800]  they would deny, your kid had a convulsion as we gave him a shot to, it's normal to have
[35:32.800 --> 35:36.800]  a seizure. But if you're going home and now the doctors tell them, this came out three
[35:36.800 --> 35:39.800]  years ago, three and a half years ago, there were so many convulsions from the H1N1. They
[35:39.800 --> 35:44.800]  said, look, just put something hard in their mouth, wooden or whatever you've got, not
[35:44.800 --> 35:45.800]  metal to break their teeth off.
[35:45.800 --> 35:49.800]  You gotta shove something in their mouth. Okay, I'm gonna give them this shot. And if
[35:49.800 --> 35:55.800]  they have a convulsion today, it's quite normal. Just put something between their teeth. Imagine,
[35:55.800 --> 36:01.800]  this is quite normal, but they may have a convulsion. And of course, I laugh because
[36:01.800 --> 36:06.800]  it's so sick. It's the laugh of pain. I mean, I have been on vacation or on the streets
[36:06.800 --> 36:11.800]  and you'll run into people and they'll have a five year old that's autistic sitting there,
[36:11.800 --> 36:13.800]  talking to themselves.
[36:13.800 --> 36:20.300]  Sometimes it'll be a younger child, older child, beautiful soul that had a great future
[36:20.300 --> 36:24.800]  ahead of him. And I'll say, when did that happen? Were they born like that? Very nice
[36:24.800 --> 36:31.800]  child. And they'll go, no, Billy was 18 months old and we went in for a second round of shots
[36:31.800 --> 36:38.800]  and he couldn't wake up the next morning. He didn't talk for a week and he never talked
[36:38.800 --> 36:39.800]  again.
[36:39.800 --> 36:43.300]  He was talking so much and so happy and he hadn't talked since. And he's seven years
[36:43.300 --> 36:47.500]  old now and we believe it's the vaccines, but the doctors say it isn't. Yeah, cuz the
[36:47.500 --> 36:52.600]  doctors gave it to your kid. They're never gonna say they're wrong. Once the Nazis started
[36:52.600 --> 36:57.600]  killing people, and Hitler said now killed millions, they couldn't say no cuz, well,
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.600]  they've done the right thing before. Same thing with the Soviets, same thing with all
[37:02.600 --> 37:06.600]  these pundits and people wanting to take our guns and wanting collectivism and wanting
[37:06.600 --> 37:07.600]  tyranny.
[37:07.600 --> 37:16.200]  They cannot and they will not ever say they were wrong. No matter how crazy it gets, no
[37:16.200 --> 37:23.480]  matter how out of control it gets, most of them will commit to evil forever. If you see
[37:23.480 --> 37:29.280]  the corruption, if you know about liberty, thank God you grew up, had the genetics, had
[37:29.280 --> 37:35.620]  the locale, had the mentors to be able to have common sense.
[37:35.620 --> 37:40.660]  People that get into fraud, it's like gamblers I've known. I've known people that are very
[37:40.660 --> 37:45.100]  successful in business, but blow all their money on gambling. And I'm like, listen, stop
[37:45.100 --> 37:49.260]  gambling and you can get out of all this. No, no, no, I'm gonna go gamble more and I'll
[37:49.260 --> 37:54.980]  get on top of this. And I'm like, listen, it's designed that big thing out in the desert
[37:54.980 --> 37:58.600]  and all these systems to separate you from your money.
[37:58.600 --> 38:05.920]  The House will always win long term. They trumpet the winner, sometimes staged, to make
[38:05.920 --> 38:11.440]  you think everybody's a winner, okay? But statistically, you lose about 70% of the time
[38:11.440 --> 38:18.280]  or more. Don't be a sucker. If you wanna gamble, gamble in business and real life where you
[38:18.280 --> 38:19.280]  have a chance of winning.
[38:19.280 --> 38:23.480]  Cuz the gambling spirit is actually something genetically and chemically they've proven
[38:23.480 --> 38:29.300]  in the brain that is actually associated with leadership. But they take it and misappropriate
[38:29.300 --> 38:34.640]  it like a mind control system. It's like the snake in the Jungle Book trying to hypnotize
[38:34.640 --> 38:39.940]  people. That is a facsimile. It is a fraud. You wanna go play poker with your buddies,
[38:39.940 --> 38:40.940]  that's one thing.
[38:40.940 --> 38:44.600]  At least you got an even chance of winning. That's why you don't see a lot of poker going
[38:44.600 --> 38:49.500]  on at the big casinos. Blackjack, you might have a chance to win, but everything else
[38:49.500 --> 38:55.180]  is a fraud at the end of the day. I mean, if you bet your buddies 20 bucks on a football
[38:55.180 --> 38:57.900]  game as it makes more interest rate, I get that.
[38:57.900 --> 39:11.680]  But how do I even get off into gambling? Vaccines. With vaccines, it is just a complete and total
[39:11.680 --> 39:20.420]  fraud. And it's not my opinion of that. And I have a stack of articles here. Piers Morgan
[39:20.420 --> 39:25.660]  falls ill days after receiving flu vaccine. In fact, let's work into these videos right
[39:25.660 --> 39:28.660]  now and then back into the guns and then your phone calls.
[39:28.660 --> 39:34.900]  Piers Morgan falls ill days after receiving flu vaccine. And I desperately try to get
[39:34.900 --> 39:41.300]  mainline talk show host who are intelligent and see a lot of what's going on to talk about
[39:41.300 --> 39:45.140]  vaccines. But they don't wanna do it because the corporate media has put a stigma on it
[39:45.140 --> 39:47.420]  of quote, conspiracy theorist.
[39:47.420 --> 39:51.000]  And run other hoaxes where they claim Dr. Wakefield was involved in a fraud. He's never
[39:51.000 --> 39:56.420]  admitted to that. The evidence has been proven to be a fraud. Turns out the evidence against
[39:56.420 --> 40:01.220]  him has been a fraud. There were three previous studies, two of them in England, finding what
[40:01.220 --> 40:09.200]  he found years before. And there's a major association with autoimmune disorders and
[40:09.200 --> 40:13.460]  vaccine contaminants in the intestines in the brain.
[40:13.460 --> 40:19.460]  That's why you drink alcohol to affect your brain. It's the same thing. And so much of
[40:19.460 --> 40:24.300]  what he said was dead on, that's why they've gone after him. So they run these hoaxes,
[40:24.300 --> 40:30.380]  kinda like free energy or things like that. They run a hoax 20 years ago saying, no such
[40:30.380 --> 40:37.420]  thing as that. And say, it was done in a mayonnaise jar. So it's all a scam. And then meanwhile,
[40:37.420 --> 40:41.500]  all these real things that get developed never can be deployed as people were told it was
[40:41.500 --> 40:43.940]  a fraud.
[40:43.940 --> 40:49.420]  So there's all these hoaxes going on. But in Adan Salazar's excellent article, he links
[40:49.420 --> 40:55.820]  to the CDC's own seasonal flu vaccine fact guide. In fact, I'm gonna get Adan to also
[40:55.820 --> 41:01.620]  link to their adverse reaction page where it says death, seizures, narcolepsy. I mean,
[41:01.620 --> 41:06.500]  just hundreds of things. And then I can show you mainstream news articles where they say
[41:06.500 --> 41:07.940]  there is no side effects.
[41:07.940 --> 41:11.980]  It's a conspiracy theory. In fact, I've read those articles where it says, crazy people
[41:11.980 --> 41:17.080]  like Alex Jones and Dr. Blaylock. They say vaccines are causing brain damage and autoimmune
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.380]  disorders and swelling in the brain. There is no proof and the government says zero side
[41:22.380 --> 41:31.700]  effects. You go read the inserts of all these vaccines. All of them include death, death,
[41:31.700 --> 41:41.520]  death. And it's so frustrating to know that aspartame and Diet Coke and thousands of products
[41:41.520 --> 41:43.500]  causes macular degeneration.
[41:43.500 --> 41:48.340]  And to know people that drink these diet drinks and eat the diet candy and go, hey, I hear
[41:48.340 --> 41:53.700]  you're going blind. Can I give you some literature? No, I don't wanna see it. Cuz see, they don't
[41:53.700 --> 42:00.020]  wanna admit they were wrong to do this. I mean, look, I know it's wrong that I like
[42:00.020 --> 42:02.260]  to eat 30 ounce steaks.
[42:02.260 --> 42:07.540]  I know it's wrong that I do unhealthy things. At least I know it. But I mean, a steak's
[42:07.540 --> 42:12.620]  a lot better than aspartame. I know getting angry is not good for me, but I still do it
[42:12.620 --> 42:18.580]  cuz it's who I am. This stuff is meant to hurt you. And people say, like the young Turks
[42:18.580 --> 42:20.900]  guy, I admit it's all happening, but they don't mean it.
[42:20.900 --> 42:26.300]  Well, I've got books where they admit, like Eco Science, they're doing it on purpose.
[42:26.300 --> 42:33.820]  And see, that's the issue. That's what's so frustrating about this is that I have watched
[42:33.820 --> 42:39.220]  people. I know two local talk show hosts. One says I can talk about it, the other says
[42:39.220 --> 42:46.780]  I can't, that work at the same company who took the H1N1 shot, despite everything I said
[42:46.780 --> 42:52.580]  to them four years ago, who got mild cases of Guillain-Barre, neurological disorder so
[42:52.580 --> 42:54.500]  bad their hands and feet became numb.
[42:54.500 --> 43:01.520]  Sometimes it totally paralyzes you and kills you. And the doctors even told them this is
[43:01.520 --> 43:08.340]  a vaccine reaction. One of them was Dale Dudley, one of the top morning shows in town on 93.7,
[43:08.340 --> 43:15.980]  the sister station to our AM 590. And I was on his show and he said, I haven't told anybody
[43:15.980 --> 43:18.260]  this yet, but I'll go ahead and tell you how to go to the doctor's stuff.
[43:18.260 --> 43:21.580]  The crew knows, remember for a couple months, my hands got numb, my feet, I went to the
[43:21.580 --> 43:27.580]  doctor, I was so scared, I got a mild case of Guillain-Barre. Yeah, what about the articles
[43:27.580 --> 43:33.420]  from yesterday, 800 European children developed narcolepsy after receiving H1N1 vaccine. Here's
[43:33.420 --> 43:37.300]  another one, at least 50 African children paralyzed after receiving Bill Gates backed
[43:37.300 --> 43:43.740]  meningitis vaccine, natural news, links to all the mainstream articles.
[43:43.740 --> 43:49.760]  I mean, it's in major newspapers like CBS that 60 something thousand Indian children
[43:49.760 --> 43:56.940]  last year got paralyzed, many of them died after taking the UN polio vaccine, because
[43:56.940 --> 44:02.580]  it is polio. I mean, it's so cold blooded that Stalin said one man dies, it's a statistic,
[44:02.580 --> 44:08.380]  a million dies, or one man dies, it's a tragedy, a million dies, it's a statistic.
[44:08.380 --> 44:12.140]  And to know, it's like back of the paper, 60 something thousand kids, thousands of them
[44:12.140 --> 44:17.500]  died. They're like, well, it's a side effect, no big deal. It's like, hey, yeah, 60,000
[44:17.500 --> 44:23.780]  kids paralyzed. But you hear about the 20th Sandy Hook, yeah, I mean, it's so over the
[44:23.780 --> 44:27.540]  top how they decide when to punch the buttons of what's said.
[44:27.540 --> 44:32.580]  And Alex, what about the kids? Turn your guns in. I'm like, but crimes drop 49% violent
[44:32.580 --> 44:37.620]  crime. Here, let me give you the actual, I don't believe those statistics. Thought you
[44:37.620 --> 44:40.940]  don't believe the government? Well, no, these are locally compiled, some of the most accurate
[44:40.940 --> 44:44.020]  statisticians world over say these are some of the most accurate in the world are the
[44:44.020 --> 44:48.580]  example of what's accurate. It's something good set up 50 years ago, very accurate crime
[44:48.580 --> 44:49.580]  statistics.
[44:49.580 --> 44:55.820]  I don't wanna see that, I don't. They don't wanna hear the reality, but reaching out to
[44:55.820 --> 44:59.180]  Piers Morgan, people say, well, why are you making a big deal to Piers Morgan if he has
[44:59.180 --> 45:06.380]  a half million viewers? That blow up on air was aired on every major English station in
[45:06.380 --> 45:07.380]  the world that I know of.
[45:07.380 --> 45:10.820]  It's one of the biggest media events, not just of this year, but last year, and it's
[45:10.820 --> 45:18.700]  been rated as such. And I didn't really do all that on purpose. I just said, God, whatever
[45:18.700 --> 45:22.860]  you want me to do, have me do it, and that's what happened. And notice they're not having
[45:22.860 --> 45:24.200]  me on all these other shows.
[45:24.200 --> 45:28.560]  They could have me on MSNBC and get double ratings for the week. They could have me on
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.180]  all these Fox News and increase their ratings, they know that. I mean, I've talked to executives
[45:34.180 --> 45:37.660]  of these companies over and over again over the years. We really want you, we're trying
[45:37.660 --> 45:40.820]  to get you, but there's no way that the execs are gonna kill it.
[45:40.820 --> 45:45.260]  And I'm like, that's fine, I don't wanna be on there, stop calling me. But don't you wanna
[45:45.260 --> 45:49.140]  come up here and shoot a pilot? I mean, they wanna meet with you and stuff, but they just
[45:49.140 --> 45:54.660]  wanna know that, are you gonna work with them? No, I'm not gonna work with you, I don't care.
[45:54.660 --> 46:01.020]  I can't be around all those plastic fake people and all the bleach blondes and all the soulless
[46:01.020 --> 46:04.020]  people.
[46:04.020 --> 46:10.140]  I'll build my own thing, thank you. But that's not what this is even about. My point is,
[46:10.140 --> 46:15.900]  why haven't they had me back on these shows? Because they acted like and spun it. Discrediting,
[46:15.900 --> 46:20.260]  look at the crazy gun owners. They don't want you getting out of your trance. They want
[46:20.260 --> 46:25.580]  a calm English accent or an NPR accent selling you on tyranny.
[46:25.580 --> 46:28.460]  They don't want somebody getting up and going, don't take the shots, they're designed to
[46:28.460 --> 46:35.300]  hurt you. Here's proof, wake up, get out of your trance. Wake up, wake up, wake up. I've
[46:35.300 --> 46:39.180]  been effective with my approach, not because I even calculated it, but because it's real
[46:39.180 --> 46:41.820]  and organic and it speaks to people's common sense.
[46:41.820 --> 46:48.500]  Everybody listening took the flu shot or knows somebody that did, that almost died. Everybody
[46:48.500 --> 46:52.620]  knows they took the flu shot and got deathly ill that week. They're giving you the flu.
[46:52.620 --> 46:56.300]  And the more people take the shot, they've got studies, the more flu there is that year,
[46:56.300 --> 47:03.740]  cuz there's flu in it. And I've got top scientists on about this. How many medical doctors, how
[47:03.740 --> 47:07.420]  many endocrinologists, how many virologists?
[47:07.420 --> 47:11.460]  British studies, Canadian studies three years ago, it doubles your chances of getting the
[47:11.460 --> 47:17.060]  flu when you take the shot. That's in Adan Salazar's article. I mean, that's why I'm
[47:17.060 --> 47:23.020]  frustrated, that's why I'm angry. I mean, I know this stuff's hurting people. Every
[47:23.020 --> 47:26.940]  time I go on vacation, every time I'm in a shopping mall, every time I'm in a restaurant,
[47:26.940 --> 47:31.300]  almost every time in a movie theater, the whole front row is autistic kids.
[47:31.300 --> 47:37.740]  Yelling and screaming during the whole thing, just their minds completely attacked. The
[47:37.740 --> 47:43.500]  cerebral cortex attacks, so they can't process their subconscious info coming out. So that's
[47:43.500 --> 47:48.660]  why things are so intense to them. These are damaged, partially wrecked human souls. And
[47:48.660 --> 47:54.060]  it gets to me because I have empathy, ladies and gentlemen, not because I'm a hero.
[47:54.060 --> 47:58.940]  My programming is if the children are being hurt, mine aren't safe. And that's not a conscious
[47:58.940 --> 48:04.180]  cold-blooded thing. I can analyze why my programming gets upset. It's self-preservation, folks.
[48:04.180 --> 48:10.920]  It isn't cuz I'm goody two-shoes. It's because I am a rootin' tootin', out of control hillbilly
[48:10.920 --> 48:17.300]  Yosemite Sam. And I know corrupt thugs when I see it, and I go ape when I see it.
[48:17.300 --> 48:22.340]  So I guess it's true, Piers Morgan, I am a gorilla from Texas. But this gorilla knows
[48:22.340 --> 48:27.780]  which way his soul is pointed. This gorilla has his head turned around straight. And you
[48:27.780 --> 48:33.700]  took the shot with Dr. Oz a week ago, and we said he's gonna get sick, or that's fake.
[48:33.700 --> 48:36.860]  Cuz it's turned out the politicians in Europe have been caught taking fake shots, and they
[48:36.860 --> 48:42.700]  get their own shot, or a sugar water shot that came out three years ago with the H1N1.
[48:42.700 --> 48:48.100]  And he's on there with Dwight Yoakam. And Dwight Yoakam, well, I mean, here is the clip.
[48:48.100 --> 48:52.740]  After he takes the flu shot, he gets super sick. He's having trouble getting over it.
[48:52.740 --> 48:55.420]  And he's asking Dwight Yoakam why this happened. Here it is.
[48:55.420 --> 48:59.260]  25 million records. Dwight Yoakam is much more than a country superstar. He's a talented
[48:59.260 --> 49:02.740]  actor with a lot to say about issues that matter to America. Dwight's latest album is
[49:02.740 --> 49:04.260]  three pairs. Welcome to you, Dwight.
[49:04.260 --> 49:05.260]  Thank you.
[49:05.260 --> 49:06.260]  If we go any further, you're a singer.
[49:06.260 --> 49:07.260]  Yeah.
[49:07.260 --> 49:08.260]  You must have had sore throat.
[49:08.260 --> 49:09.260]  I hear this.
[49:09.260 --> 49:13.540]  Well, as you can tell, things are deteriorating. Is there any advice you can give me?
[49:13.540 --> 49:18.540]  Don't ever take a flu shot again. Now, I watched that night with Dr. Oz, and in deference to
[49:18.540 --> 49:29.260]  Dr. Oz, I think he's, he seems like a completely competent doctor. And I don't understand any
[49:29.260 --> 49:35.060]  of the kind of biological aspects of the meds that-
[49:35.060 --> 49:39.340]  But we're both doing the maths, aren't we? We both saw him put that thing in my arm.
[49:39.340 --> 49:40.340]  Yeah.
[49:40.340 --> 49:41.340]  And within ten days, I've been struck down.
[49:41.340 --> 49:46.940]  And I just, you know what? I don't want to tell anybody out there I'm not a medical advisor.
[49:46.940 --> 49:51.260]  Get your vaccines if you, I don't believe in them. I'm just suspicious by nature, and
[49:51.260 --> 49:53.620]  I saw you get it, and here we are.
[49:53.620 --> 49:57.980]  Well, let's try, we'll try and plow on with the interview, not withstand the fact I can't.
[49:57.980 --> 50:01.700]  Yeah, that's good. And you can go read the full transcript at info.wars.com, and Morgan's
[50:01.700 --> 50:08.380]  like yeah, you can't disagree, I take it and I'm sick. And of course, that could be anecdotal.
[50:08.380 --> 50:14.240]  But it's not with the thousands of cases we all know about, okay? I mean, my grandmother's
[50:14.240 --> 50:19.580]  best friend, registered nurse, whole nine yards, constantly takes vaccines. Takes the
[50:19.580 --> 50:23.060]  single shingle shot, gets the shingles.
[50:23.060 --> 50:28.220]  And then my dad is a oral surgeon and a dentist, and he talks to people. And he goes, yeah,
[50:28.220 --> 50:30.780]  I've talked to, this is like a month ago, I never told the story. Cuz I've talked to
[50:30.780 --> 50:36.860]  three people that took the shingle shot and got it. I mean, it's just insane that this
[50:36.860 --> 50:39.660]  is going on, okay?
[50:39.660 --> 50:43.220]  And we're gonna come back and get into the guns, get into the whole Dianne Feinstein
[50:43.220 --> 50:47.400]  situation, and then open the phones up in the second hour. And then you remember the
[50:47.400 --> 50:52.780]  guys that dressed up like pimps and brought down Acorn and exposed Planned Parenthood's
[50:52.780 --> 50:56.260]  open plan to kill black people, kill black babies?
[50:56.260 --> 51:00.660]  The legends are gonna be joining us here on air, James O'Keefe.
[51:00.660 --> 51:04.400]  If you've ever wanted one of our best selling generators, but we're waiting for an offer
[51:04.400 --> 51:09.340]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not gonna wanna miss this exciting message.
[51:09.340 --> 51:15.180]  Here's why. Our solar generators provide life saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators,
[51:15.180 --> 51:20.260]  solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun. So when
[51:20.260 --> 51:23.420]  the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[51:23.420 --> 51:28.760]  Now here's the best part. Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't
[51:28.760 --> 51:34.460]  sell as new. We put them in a special spot in our warehouse and we discount them heavily
[51:34.460 --> 51:39.020]  at the end of each year. We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like
[51:39.020 --> 51:44.700]  new. Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[51:44.700 --> 51:51.180]  Don't wait, they go fast. Go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com. For the craziest
[51:51.180 --> 51:58.180]  offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com, that's scratchanddentsolar.com.

[52:58.120 --> 53:03.680]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial
[53:03.680 --> 53:08.920]  affairs? I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation
[53:08.920 --> 53:12.960]  of stocks and bonds. It makes me wonder if the U.S. citizen will ever again have the
[53:12.960 --> 53:17.740]  right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, with the Drug and
[53:17.740 --> 53:22.820]  Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy
[53:22.820 --> 53:27.960]  Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings
[53:27.960 --> 53:32.040]  are subject to government intervention. For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared
[53:32.040 --> 53:35.960]  a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately. Whether if you
[53:35.960 --> 53:40.280]  have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives
[53:40.280 --> 53:47.040]  to give this report out free. Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237. When investing,
[53:47.040 --> 53:54.040]  always proceed with caution. Again, call 1-800-686-2237. Exercise your legal right to trade metals
[53:54.040 --> 54:12.040]  privately. 1-800-686-2237. You see, the globalists, they want to just
[54:12.040 --> 54:20.040]  normalize everybody to get accustomed to tyranny and, ah, cancer rates up several thousand
[54:20.040 --> 54:24.080]  percentage and everybody gets breast cancer and everybody gets testicular cancer early
[54:24.080 --> 54:28.640]  and yeah, you know, childhood cancer didn't exist 100 years ago, it was super rare 50
[54:28.640 --> 54:29.640]  years ago.
[54:29.640 --> 54:36.800]  You know, now it's up over 10,000% on average. And yeah, if a girl has a Hello Kitty bubble
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.480]  machine that is in the shape of a gun because it's handheld but it's not even called a gun.
[54:41.480 --> 54:46.000]  My kids actually have had one of those, my four-year-old. The police come in, you get
[54:46.000 --> 54:55.400]  questioned, we're gonna expel her. All of this is going on and it's insane and it's
[54:55.400 --> 54:58.320]  political correctness and total control.
[54:58.320 --> 55:03.400]  And then a girl draws a paper gun and the police are called. She just, again, it's an
[55:03.400 --> 55:07.800]  attack on ideas. It's authoritarianism in the name of the nanny state and the people
[55:07.800 --> 55:11.920]  running it, they're the ones buying the 1.6 billion bullets. They're the ones talking
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.600]  about a revolution. They're the ones fantasizing about bringing in Chinese troops against us,
[55:16.600 --> 55:18.280]  whether that's feasible or not.
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.680]  They're the ones in the Daily Beast saying, we need to have the Communist Chinese tell
[55:22.680 --> 55:27.180]  us what to do. Alex Jones is the enemy. I read those quotes yesterday. I mean, it's
[55:27.180 --> 55:32.780]  bizarre stuff in the peers pressure story. Look at this article if you're watching on
[55:32.780 --> 55:33.780]  TV.
[55:33.780 --> 55:39.680]  A London Telegraph, Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set. Now, my son is building
[55:39.680 --> 55:43.640]  this right now. And I'm gonna bring this in, I'm gonna try to get him to finish it, it's
[55:43.640 --> 55:49.240]  really big. Lego has been accused of racism by the Turkish community over a Star Wars
[55:49.240 --> 55:53.240]  model that supposedly resembles one of Istanbul's most revered mosque.
[55:53.240 --> 55:58.080]  And folks, it has a slight dome on it, looks almost nothing like it. By the way, that's
[55:58.080 --> 56:03.760]  Christian architecture there. That was a Christian church. So is the big church in Istanbul.
[56:03.760 --> 56:08.440]  The point is it looks almost nothing like it. And they say Jabba the Hutt is meant to
[56:08.440 --> 56:18.360]  look like Arabs. I mean, Jabba the Hutt is a giant space alien worm who talks like Cookie
[56:18.360 --> 56:19.360]  Monster.
[56:19.360 --> 56:30.440]  Teeny Jedi. I mean, this is what it's reached. Hello Kitty guns, bubble guns, Jabba the Hutt
[56:30.440 --> 56:35.460]  things and the media takes us and goes, no, it's quite normal. Robin Page of the BBC was
[56:35.460 --> 56:40.720]  arrested for saying rural communities deserve the same rights as homosexuals and Muslims.
[56:40.720 --> 56:45.040]  And they said the word homosexual is judged to be mean and the guy's not even a conservative
[56:45.040 --> 56:46.040]  and they go on arresting.
[56:46.040 --> 56:49.560]  And of course the charges were dropped cuz there were no real charges. It's great the
[56:49.560 --> 56:56.360]  idea of you have no speech. They're gonna be able to ban real guns if kids, I see articles
[56:56.360 --> 57:00.960]  every month where somebody will do a zombie story. I've seen this dozens of times, I know
[57:00.960 --> 57:01.960]  you've seen it.
[57:01.960 --> 57:05.480]  They'll write an article about zombies that are so popular and about a fictional school
[57:05.480 --> 57:10.800]  attacked by zombies and how they shoot the zombies and they will arrest you. And in one
[57:10.800 --> 57:15.400]  article it was the dad's parents were split up, the grandparents were raising the top
[57:15.400 --> 57:17.320]  honor student football player.
[57:17.320 --> 57:21.160]  And though it was fictional, the grandpa called the police and they are charging him saying
[57:21.160 --> 57:24.220]  it's terroristic threats even though it's a fictional school. I remember that a few
[57:24.220 --> 57:32.240]  years ago. And it's like where'd Bob go? He drew a gun. I mean, all we did was draw army
[57:32.240 --> 57:37.560]  fights and stuff when we were doodling as boys and the girls drew girls in dresses.
[57:37.560 --> 57:41.640]  I mean, that's what you do. All we did was play soldier. They're making normal human
[57:41.640 --> 57:46.960]  activity illegal. It's not illegal yet, but they're still acting like it is. To the point
[57:46.960 --> 57:49.960]  of ladies and gentlemen, we own the job of the hut set.
[57:49.960 --> 57:55.180]  I was playing with the figures last night saying you gotta get this built. And I was
[57:55.180 --> 57:58.480]  looking at how cool, it's got like a dozen figures. I'm gonna bring it in here as soon
[57:58.480 --> 58:02.140]  as it's done. In fact, will you call my house? I know my son's homeschooling today, but will
[58:02.140 --> 58:04.520]  you ask him as soon as you can to get this done?
[58:04.520 --> 58:11.620]  I wanna bring this in, folks. These creatures look nothing like Muslims. I mean, Star Wars
[58:11.620 --> 58:15.720]  is incredibly politically correct and is all about all cultures and groups coming together
[58:15.720 --> 58:22.320]  including aliens. It's like Star Trek, it's the opposite, is my point. But no, it's racist.
[58:22.320 --> 58:26.220]  Job of the hut's palace makes the Arabs look bad. And in Austria, they're like, we may
[58:26.220 --> 58:31.100]  shut this down actually, yes. Again, to set the precedent so they can shut anybody down
[58:31.100 --> 58:35.000]  they want. Be sure and support the broadcasters who have read the word about it and get the
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  new Come and Take It T-shirt at Infowarsstore.com.
[58:38.000 --> 58:50.640]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.640 --> 58:54.680]  Sick of the globalist eugenicist control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as

[59:53.520 --> 01:00:07.080]  Reaching war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. Big brother, mainstream
[01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:16.400]  media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:23.720]  Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:31.360]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to open the phones up in the next hour. Diane
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:37.880]  Feinstein posted her bill on her Senate website over a month ago now, and people couldn't
[01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:42.940]  believe it. And then others have introduced kind of copies of it themselves. So technically
[01:00:42.940 --> 01:00:46.760]  I'd said her bill was introduced. It's officially been introduced today. And it's worse than
[01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:49.880]  we even thought. We're going to be going over some of that. But I'd said, the way the other
[01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:57.080]  one was written, it could be handguns, shotguns, even pump shotguns, or pump rifles.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.680]  People say pump rifles. They do have a lot of pump rifles, folks. You don't seem to be
[01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:06.100]  aware of that. Anything with a pistol grip on it. It's just incredible. And she is so
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:11.400]  disgusting in her press conference, we're going to play this clip coming up, talking
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:22.520]  about the gun lobby can't beat the cross lobby. Using Christianity, is Diane Feinstein a Christian?
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:27.280]  And speaking for Christians, even if she was a Christian, you do not speak for me, lady.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:32.940]  And I think it's just outrageous that people think it's okay to walk on Christians. Can
[01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:41.080]  you imagine if I got up here and spoke for Islam when I'm not a Muslim or a follower
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.200]  of the Prophet Muhammad?
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:50.480]  Can you imagine what would happen? Can you imagine if I got up here and if I spoke for
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:58.800]  Jewish groups? Or if I spoke for atheist groups? Well, as an atheist, I believe in God. And
[01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:03.160]  as a Christian, I believe in turning your guns in, even though I'm not a Christian.
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:07.560]  I mean, it is over the top. We're going to open the phones up in the next segment. I
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:11.960]  want to give the number out in the next segment, we'll open the phones up then. But start your
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:16.160]  engines, I want to specifically hear about that. But how big is this article? This article
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:22.600]  needs to get out to everybody because you've got Dwight Yoakam on with Piers Morgan.
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.800]  And Piers Morgan said, I got the flu shot and now I'm really been sick for a week. And
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.440]  he's like, well, don't take the flu shot. I want to get Dwight Yoakam on, I've always
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:36.800]  been a fan anyway, so let that word go out. By the way, my buddies here in the office,
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:42.560]  Weldon Henson was hanging out with Mike Judge again this weekend. Aaron Austin and Mike
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.560]  Judge, he's gone back to California, said, Alex, call me, I'll come on.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:50.840]  I got all these big guests I could get, but I've got to call them. And so, Chris, it is
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:56.520]  a direct order at the end of the show that you are to make me, see, I hate calling people,
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:03:01.320]  I hate bugging people. Yeah, no, but all of them, all the celebrities I need to call,
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:07.360]  okay, it's just time for me to do it. I guess I could turn you guys loose on them, but it
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:08.920]  didn't matter.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.080]  I was just watching Idiocracy a few weeks ago, I just got to get Judge on. Because we
[01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:22.320]  are entering the Idiocracy where Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set, London Telegraph,
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:28.080]  and the official Turkish group is complaining to the Austrian government. I mean, I guess
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.840]  you can't show any desert motif or desert design. By the way, that design is a medieval
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.840]  Christian design.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:44.040]  And it doesn't even look anything like the mosque. I mean, just incredible. I mean, obviously
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.560]  those that built the architecture went for a desert look. I mean, it looks like a lot
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:51.300]  of the Middle Eastern architecture, but a lot of what you call Middle Eastern is really
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:56.400]  Roman or Christian. That's a Christian built building right there, the one they're saying
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.480]  it looks like.
[01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.680]  And so because in it is Jabba the Hutt, they say Jabba the Hutt's supposed to be Arabs.
[01:04:02.680 --> 01:04:07.400]  Man, now everybody will think that cuz you said that, it's just bizarre. But again, it's
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:13.120]  a political weapon. Here's an example, I'm gonna cover this when we come back. Sigmund
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:18.280]  Freud said a fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:24.000]  Retarded just simply means lowered. But then the word retarded became politically incorrect.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:29.400]  So you can't say he's had retarded growth from lack of protein. My gosh, you're gonna
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.920]  be arrested in England. But that's a hate term. They choose whatever it is. You called,
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.400]  you said that bonsai tree by not giving much sunshine or water was retarded in its growth.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:45.500]  That's hateful. You hurt someone, you hurt someone. And it's just a weapon that is used
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.640]  to then put guilt onto people.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.800]  You won't turn your guns on cuz you're a Klan member. What's that have to do with it? Don't
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:57.560]  try to cover up your racism. We all know what you're really up to. It's to create division.
[01:04:57.560 --> 01:05:01.040]  It's to create a race war.
[01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:05.020]  Millions of people are going to get sick this winter from colds, flu and other illnesses.

[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:21.400]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:26.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, if you're joining us in the second hour, you probably
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:33.160]  heard me break down the 150 plus firearms and their variants. The way I read our bill,
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:39.160]  we've got a copy of it right here. The way I read the list, or their variants, it's way
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:44.880]  more than 150. I know the Associated Press and others are saying 150, that is not the
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.880]  case.
[01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:50.520]  The way the ATF, in fact, man, sometimes I wish I could just be in their writing articles.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:54.600]  It's more effective than just being on air talking about it. But I'm putting it out.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:58.240]  People will go research it and get their own articles out of Not Our Guys, cuz we're just
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.520]  overworked here. There's just too many baseballs getting thrown at us here, too many news things.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:08.960]  All AK types, including the following, and then it goes on. All of these types, all of
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:15.760]  those types, they say it over and over again. So they list 150 firearms on this page. It's
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:24.880]  way over that in her official bill from page TNW M2HB, and this is just one of the pages.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:31.000]  I mean, it's way over 150. It's almost all semi-auto handguns, rifles, shotguns that
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.120]  have got grips on them, but then shotguns that can also take clips, even if they're
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.760]  only designed to take four rounds.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:43.960]  I mean, it's over. They're coming after everything. They are coming after everything. And this
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:52.080]  is just completely, completely out of control. So I wanna get your take on the official bill
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:10:03.360]  here. But first off, I'm gonna give you the number. It's 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:07.440]  And we will get you up and on the air about this situation.
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:12.080]  Now also, I covered it last hour. It's a big deal. We have time, we'll play the clip again.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:21.360]  Dwight Yoakam, I'm a big fan of. Piers Morgan falls ill days after receiving flu vaccine.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:28.520]  And he goes on the Piers Morgan show and Piers basically goes, yeah, I got the flu shot from
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.600]  Dr. Oz and then got sick a week later, and I'm really sick.
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:39.580]  Whenever this flu is, it also attacks your lungs. You have like a hemorrhagic light form
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:43.920]  of hemorrhagic fever. You have some of hemorrhagic, is that the proper term, response in your
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:51.680]  lungs. And it is certainly not a fun thing. But this is the type of thing. People won't
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.680]  read the CDC's own admissions that it can kill you or give you its own autoimmune response
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:10:58.760]  in your lungs or brain.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.400]  They won't tell you it can cause Guillain-Barre permanently or kill you. They don't tell you
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:08.320]  it can cause hundreds of things. People don't go look that up. The media just says there's
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:13.120]  no side effects, don't listen to conspiracy theorists. But when Piers Morgan gets sick
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.100]  after the flu shot and Dwight Yoakam says don't take the flu shot, that's the type of
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:20.400]  thing that will get to the sheeple.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:23.400]  The sheeple, a lot of them will go, I still take it even though I get sick usually when
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.160]  I take it. I've talked too long, but you don't think there's a cause and effect there. We've
[01:11:27.160 --> 01:11:31.960]  gotta try to help these folks. It's easy to laugh at them and get mad at them, they're
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.960]  victims.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:37.640]  They were set in front of the television set in the last 60 years in their diapers as a
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.780]  babysitter being programmed to be a bunch of mind-numbed robots. And we've got to deprogram
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:50.200]  them or they're gonna be used as an army, a tidal wave of foaming at the mouth, slobbering,
[01:11:50.200 --> 01:11:56.480]  drooling, miscreant, gibbering is the proper term, lemmings to run us over the cliff with
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480]  them.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:03.060]  We have got to get in there and help them. Now, I mentioned political correctness earlier.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:07.680]  Here's the CDC website if you're watching us at prisonplanet.tv. You can go read the
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:15.840]  different vaccine responses including death and depending on the vaccine you take. But
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:21.280]  getting back to political correctness, there's an all out attempt to make toy manufacturers
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:24.560]  not have GI Joe, Star Wars with guns.
[01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:29.780]  There's an all out attempt to not let boys play with toy guns or girls. That's why the
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:34.680]  police come when your neighbors call them because the kid's got an orange or pink Nerf
[01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:38.640]  gun in the yard. You see that in the news every day now. Or a girl draws a paper gun
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:42.720]  or a girl has a Hello Kitty bubble projector, it's not even a gun.
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:47.120]  My children have had multiple Hello Kitty, the exact same pink ones. And we've had a
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:54.440]  Choco Cat one that's black cuz we're racist. Absolutely, my kids wear Choco Cat outfits
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:59.960]  because we're racist, okay? I mean, the cat is black, ladies and gentlemen, Choco Cat.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:06.040]  My wife's got a Choco Cat nightgown. Total racism again. And you're saying, Alex, don't
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:10.600]  be silly. Folks, they mean it to be mindless and over the top. Let's punch up for viewers.
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:17.160]  I covered this last hour, but I'm gonna segue this into guns, then your calls. London Telegraph,
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:19.920]  Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set.
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:24.840]  The official Austrian government's looking at it. The big Turkish council, the biggest
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:31.680]  minority council in Austria is outraged and is demanding an apology. And there may need
[01:13:31.680 --> 01:13:38.160]  to be reparations from Lego because, ladies and gentlemen, they say Jabba the Hutt is
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:49.080]  a Arab. Maybe Michael Moore. I mean, is the Goblin King supposed to be Rush Limbaugh?
[01:13:49.080 --> 01:13:54.180]  I mean, does Rush Limbaugh get angry and go on the air and say, I'm gonna sue the makers
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:14:00.240]  of The Hobbit because that looks a little bit like me too. I don't mean to rush, the
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:07.880]  point is, that's it. That's it, let's put the Goblin King on air, okay?
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.440]  People watching just Google the Goblin King, it looks a little bit like me, a little bit
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:17.520]  like Rush Limbaugh in our heavier times. And that's it, I'm suing Lego. I'm announcing
[01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:23.400]  it, I am suing Lego because my son has the Goblin King set as well. And I'm telling you,
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.240]  it looks a little bit like me.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:28.880]  That's it, that's it, you're racist against white people. You're racist against white
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.040]  guys that are a couple pounds overweight and have big heads, that's it. I am totally blown
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:41.840]  away right now by, there it is. Look at that, they are making fun of me right there, click
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:43.300]  it for people that are watching.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:47.920]  This is outrageous. That's me when I wake up in the morning and I've had too much to
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:54.800]  drink. I mean, this is incredible, I am suing Lego. I want a press release right now. I
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:59.200]  agree that the job of the hutch is supposed to be Muslims, it's obvious.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:03.400]  And it's obvious that the whole Return of the Jedi is to make fun of Muslims, it's absolutely
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.520]  proof. Even though it's a politically correct movie about integrating everybody, still it
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:12.620]  doesn't matter. George Lucas should be arrested right now, he is a racist and gun owners should
[01:15:12.620 --> 01:15:14.600]  be arrested because they're racist.
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:20.200]  They're like Hitler, you hear it on every TV channel every day, everything, I agree.
[01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:26.400]  Amazing, and by the way, if you're a new listener, I'm joking about the Goblin King stuff in
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:30.420]  the lawsuit. The point is they really are looking at legal action in Austria over the
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:36.840]  Star Wars job of the hut palace that I bought just about a week and a half ago for my son
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.840]  at the Lego store.
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:43.400]  Only reason to go to the mall is to go to the Lego store. The Turkish community said
[01:15:43.400 --> 01:15:49.840]  the model was based on a mosque in Istanbul and that the accompanying figures depict Asians
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:54.240]  and Orientals as people with deceitful and criminal personalities, the Turkish cultural
[01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:55.240]  community.
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.880]  Well, I guess Emperor Palpatine's meant to make white people look bad, I think this is
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:02.600]  just total bull. Why is Mace Windu a good guy? He's a black guy, I thought mostly blacks
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.960]  look bad, he's racist. The Turkish cultural community of Austria released a statement
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:11.920]  calling for Lego to apologize for affronting religious and cultural feelings.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:16.320]  And they go on to say they believe that Jabba the Hutt is supposed to be a Muslim. I mean,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:21.720]  folks, this is so over the top, I just can't get over it, but they know what they're doing.
[01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:27.600]  This is cultural Marxism, this is the type of control they admit they're using. Here's
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:31.920]  an example, you use the word homosexual in a news article in England, you will be arrested
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:37.240]  because they say the word homosexual offends people, even though it's the scientific name.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:41.120]  If you use the term Caucasian now, they're saying it's racist cuz it's a racial name,
[01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:45.640]  even though it's just a scientific designation, caucus mountains. If you use the word Negro,
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:51.540]  which comes out of Latin for Negro or black, it has nothing to do with the N word.
[01:16:51.540 --> 01:16:55.840]  People think it does, and they get in trouble. I've seen articles where they take people
[01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:02.720]  to jail for using that word. It's amazing how they do this. And again, it's to get you
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:08.680]  so scared, you won't talk. I better not have Hello Kitty bubble gum, it shoots bubbles
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:13.880]  as evil. Better not buy my son a Nerf gun to play in the yard, the cops will come.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:19.360]  I better not, I better not, I better watch my speech, I better, I better. And the other
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:24.520]  night on the nightly news, we had this quote that I was actually familiar with cuz I read
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:30.120]  some of the writings over a decade ago, Sigmund Freud. What he says is totally true. You notice
[01:17:30.120 --> 01:17:35.400]  people that are anti-gun always say we have the guns because we have small members.
[01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:43.600]  Which is just absolutely asinine, guns are about self-defense. But Sigmund Freud said
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:49.400]  a fear of weapons is a sign of retarded sexual and emotional maturity. General introduction
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:54.560]  to Psychoanalysis published 1920. And I read that book. That's why when I saw them, they
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.560]  said, is this a real quote?
[01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.840]  Well, it looked it up, confirmed it wasn't. No, actually, he does a whole chapter of how
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:02.800]  ridiculous people are that are scared of weapons in the hands of citizens. He even talks about
[01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:07.240]  when they see soldiers with guns, they're not scared cuz it's the state. They're scared
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:11.240]  of other people having guns cuz they're scared of what they would do with guns.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.760]  That's why they're always talking about how they wanna kill people. Piers Morgan and Buzz
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.320]  Bissinger and the rest of them because Bissinger on the show said, I'm mentally ill. I'm on
[01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:23.000]  drugs. He said the next day when people said, why'd you say kill Alex? He goes, well, I'm
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.320]  mentally ill. See, that's their excuse to be what they are because they are mentally
[01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.320]  ill.
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:33.400]  You understand? They don't want you having a gun cuz they're scared of a knife, the studies
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.960]  show. I mean, I've been around liberals and people in college and pulled out a knife or
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:42.980]  something to cut something. Watch out with that. I mean, they're just totally scared
[01:18:42.980 --> 01:18:43.980]  of everything.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:47.400]  And then see, politically correct, Jacobson's like, man, I bet when you read that they're
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.320]  gonna get politically correct. Retarded just means you didn't feed the bonsai tree enough
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:56.160]  water so it's small. But the term becomes like a pejorative so they say, don't use it.
[01:18:56.160 --> 01:19:00.680]  Sigmund Freud says they have never developed their sexual and emotional maturity. And the
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:07.000]  word to describe that is stunted or retarded. But see, my gosh, I hear about talk show hosts
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.080]  getting fired for using the word.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:18.760]  See how we're losing our language? Can't say cockazoid, can't say oriental, they say that's
[01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:23.300]  racist now. Everything, put suicide nets around the Apple factory with hundreds of people
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:27.080]  jumping off of it where they have to put suicide nets up. That's no big deal. Fourth abortion's
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.880]  no big deal.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:33.880]  You wanna inject a bunch of Guatemalan kids with syphilis and kill them, go ahead. That's
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:39.440]  the government. But hey, Hello Kitty, bubble guns that shoot bubbles. You know what? Let's
[01:19:39.440 --> 01:19:44.480]  call the cops. I mean, let's call them right now. Let's call them immediately. The way
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:49.760]  to handle this political correctness is what's happened with these outdoor shows that banned
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:54.720]  guns at them. Everybody just boycotted it, now it's been canceled. Okay, that's the answer.
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:59.440]  They're trying to boycott us and have a revolution against us to shut us down. We shut them down.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.960]  It's us or them.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:05.800]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:10.400]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on

[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.680]  requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the

[01:22:29.120 --> 01:22:33.520]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[01:22:33.520 --> 01:22:38.360]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry
[01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:42.980]  won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed paper investments
[01:22:42.980 --> 01:22:49.760]  yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:55.600]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237. Secure
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:58.920]  your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:05.880]  Hey there, Frank Bates here. Have you heard about the weird device that could wipe out
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:12.000]  280 million Americans? This is really scary stuff. Defense experts warn that this odd
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.300]  device poses the gravest threat we've ever known. In fact, just a few weeks ago, former
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:21.360]  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece for the Washington Post warning
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.200]  about this deadly threat. I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.920]  It may be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up. That's why my friend
[01:23:30.920 --> 01:23:37.000]  just created a free video at weirddevice.com that exposes this threat and blows the doors
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.680]  off the conspiracy. Go watch the shocking video at weirddevice.com right now to discover
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:47.880]  exactly what it is, plus discover the number one way you and your family can survive this
[01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:53.120]  deadly attack. I'm not sure how long this video will be online, so go to weirddevice.com
[01:23:53.120 --> 01:24:10.080]  before it's gone forever. Again, that's weirddevice.com. James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project. You
[01:24:10.080 --> 01:24:13.960]  know him from bringing down an acorn exposing Planned Parenthood, taking money to make sure
[01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:20.440]  blacks get exterminated, and a lot more. Now they're going to anti-gunners houses and putting
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:23.880]  up that it's a gun-free zone up front their house. So he's gonna be joining us in the
[01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:24.880]  next hour.
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:28.360]  We're going to your phone calls right now, but if you're watching on TV or a radio listener,
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:33.600]  I'm not joking about the fact that they're talking about going after Lego and the Austrian
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.260]  government and other areas because the Muslim groups say that the Jabba the Hutt is supposed
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:45.020]  to be a Muslim. Lego accused of racism with Star Wars set, a set I own, that my son owns
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.320]  and has nothing to do with it.
[01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:50.920]  So I'm making the announcement. I believe the Goblin King, if Jabba the Hutt's supposed
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:56.920]  to be Arabs, the Goblin King, I'm even a public figure versus just Muslims in general, and
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:02.540]  I've had a little bit of jowls before being overweight and having a large head. So I believe
[01:25:02.540 --> 01:25:07.880]  Lego, based in Europe, is racist and made the new Goblin King, even though he was described
[01:25:07.880 --> 01:25:11.920]  in The Hobbit written 70 years ago or so, to look like this.
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.000]  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if Star Wars was written back in the 70s. It has nothing
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.260]  to do with Arabs. I am right now saying that is supposed to be Alex Jones. And I am going
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:27.160]  to file suit on Lego for putting out a set to demean me and describe white people as
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:29.880]  big and fat and ugly.
[01:25:29.880 --> 01:25:35.560]  That's obviously me right there. And how dare them? Where do they make Lego? Is it the Fins
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.280]  or the, yeah, Denmark, okay, the Danes. Well, that's it, they're racist towards white people,
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:47.040]  and it's obvious. They've got white figures that are fat and ugly, and I'm going to sue
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:52.040]  you. You are doing this to me. I'm filing a report with the FBI, and I'm going to the
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:53.040]  cultural organization.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:59.280]  I'm going to the Austrian government too. How dare you? I think I'm going to put a press
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:03.440]  release. I think I'm going to do that. I think I'll actually go and officially say, cuz you
[01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:08.280]  know what? You're right, Jabba the Hutt is to make fun of Arabs. Shut Lego down, racist,
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:13.960]  this is racist. Hello Kitty bubble guns, arrest the children, this is completely normal.
[01:26:13.960 --> 01:26:18.920]  Blame all gun owners for bad people. Put everyone on Prozac so they kill more people, so the
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:23.760]  psychiatrists get more money to put more people on it to kill more people. That's the answer.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:27.960]  I've been wrong all these years. The liberals are right. They're not authoritarians, they're
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:33.000]  good people. They're right, gun owners are like Nazis. And we defeated Hitler, we can
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:34.320]  defeat America.
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.920]  I agree with all the people on MSNBC. I have been wrong, and I want to apologize here on
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:46.160]  air right now. It's so obvious. My gosh, you can all sue. That looks like McAdoo, the one
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:53.640]  with the beard. My gosh, it's racist towards, it's racist. My gosh, it looks like the crew.
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:27:00.840]  There's Wes right there. I mean, that's us. It's obvious, I'm suing. It's my gosh, Lego
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:07.200]  is so evil. And it's copyright infringement. They've used my likeness without getting the
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:08.200]  authorization.
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:14.240]  You should know I actually played the goblin king. Good to see you today. I'm glad you
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:19.400]  could drop by. Actually, I'm gonna assume over Jabba the Hutt too. That's actually meant
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.040]  to make fun of me as well. I mean, just total mass liberal schizophrenia. But the establishment
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:31.120]  knows. Teenage Jedi. You guys gave me some of the text of Jabba's talk, but I think it's
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.120]  from one of the later movies.
[01:27:32.120 --> 01:27:37.640]  Yeah, this is Phantom Menace. Yeah, I need him from Return of the Jedi if I'm gonna do
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:48.240]  a. I actually need him going to actually do a better one. All right, that's enough, ladies
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:52.020]  and gentlemen. If you just tuned in, I'm illustrating their absurdity by just showing how out of
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:58.540]  control this is. And of course, Han Solo, punch it up, is shown as silver.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:06.200]  That's racism towards the Tin Man. That's why they did that. My gosh, whoa, whoa, better
[01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:14.840]  have the owners of the franchise of the Yellow Brick Road, the Wizard of Oz sue immediately.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:18.520]  I just can't believe the racism that we're seeing. See, you're meant to look for all
[01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:22.560]  this imaginary stuff. Well, meanwhile, they're taking everybody's rights and select corporations
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:24.640]  are exempt from taxes, but you and I aren't.
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:29.080]  That's the real discrimination, but they want us all fighting with each other, divide and
[01:28:29.080 --> 01:28:34.960]  conquer. We're all a bunch of mentally ill twits obsessed with political correctness.
[01:28:34.960 --> 01:28:43.300]  My dad, at one of his dental offices, bought a bunch of 1920s Art Deco Vogue art. And in
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:50.520]  one hanging in a dark corner, in a hallway, it's from the 1920s and it's Vogue. And it's
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.640]  a bunch of women dressed as flappers and one of them has a cigarette.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.200]  And he's had now multiple people, we're talking about it again. One lady came to him and said,
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:05.800]  I'm calling the police. It's illegal to show cigarette smoking. And he went, it's a museum
[01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:12.560]  piece. And she just was freaking out and some other woman got mad. And imagine, this is
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:16.120]  a poster with a woman about three, four inches tall.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:22.280]  You have the look of a bunch of people on it with a cigarette. And again, these people
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.500]  want all the old movies banned cuz they show cigarettes. They already got most of the old
[01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:33.760]  cartoons banned. They're gonna ban everything. These people are 1984 tyrants. They want control
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:34.760]  of information.
[01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:38.980]  I got a bunch of articles today where the EU is calling to be able to arrest any journalist
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:42.560]  they want for any reason, if what they say is politically correct. In fact, that's on
[01:29:42.560 --> 01:29:47.520]  infowars.com. I mean, it's out of control, I promise. Your calls on the other side of
[01:29:47.520 --> 01:29:50.160]  this break.
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:30:00.880]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:05.740]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[01:30:05.740 --> 01:30:10.320]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:15.400]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:06.220]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our

[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:46.140]  chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the

[01:32:24.540 --> 01:32:31.540]  Thank you.
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:33:01.540]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:24.540 --> 01:33:37.440]  Okay, folks, let's go to your phone calls. As promised, again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:43.240]  The news websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and they are some of the biggest and most
[01:33:43.240 --> 01:33:48.740]  important and most accurate outposts out there trying to warn people about the incredible
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:53.420]  tyranny that we're going into. And again, if we succeed and hold back the tyranny, which
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:58.940]  we've done at many levels, then people say, there's no tyranny.
[01:33:58.940 --> 01:34:03.780]  But if we don't succeed, well, then the show will just get bigger and bigger and bigger
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:08.060]  until it's finally shut down because we're going to see the tyranny expand. And that's
[01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:14.220]  why the show, the broadcast, the news organization is exploding right now is because the country
[01:34:14.220 --> 01:34:18.580]  is going to hell in a handbasket. And all the different tyrannies that I've warned you
[01:34:18.580 --> 01:34:22.060]  about are happening because the globalists write white papers.
[01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:26.380]  The Rand Corporation has been public about this. Dianne Feinstein has said she wants
[01:34:26.380 --> 01:34:31.060]  a total abolition of guns in the past. So has the Attorney General, so has Obama as
[01:34:31.060 --> 01:34:36.300]  a state senator. The UN treaty, the UN has said they want the abolition of civilian firearms
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:40.580]  on her ship because it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of a state.
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:49.300]  That is a Unideer quote, July 7th, 2001, New York City, addendum to the treaty. I mean,
[01:34:49.300 --> 01:34:53.180]  I know their goal. I've read their book. I've read their handbook. It's kind of like the
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:57.740]  New England Patriots getting the playbooks and spying on the other team. They knew what
[01:34:57.740 --> 01:34:58.740]  they were gonna do.
[01:34:58.740 --> 01:35:03.820]  I mean, I'm sitting here, they're not even hiding it. They've got a whole plan. And then
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:15.100]  they've got every day I see CNBC, MSNBC, CNN, you name it, running around saying to everybody
[01:35:15.100 --> 01:35:20.980]  that gun owners, our Klan, our racists, our Nazis, we defeated Hitler, we can defeat them.
[01:35:20.980 --> 01:35:25.900]  I mean, it's everywhere. You're seeing it. We're mass murderers. We're causing the deaths.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:30.300]  People have a right to have us not killing them as if our guns are killing them, not
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:32.580]  criminals.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:37.260]  And this is an authoritarian takeover. And it's over the top because they're going for
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:43.180]  broke. Meanwhile, they're saying Southerners are crud. Southerners have to be overcome.
[01:35:43.180 --> 01:35:47.140]  The Constitution has to be overcome, Rangel and others. You go down to UT, talk to the
[01:35:47.140 --> 01:35:51.740]  students, that's all. The Southerners must be overcome. We have video of them shot last
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:57.180]  week edited over the weekend that aired after Rangel, and it's girl after girl.
[01:35:57.180 --> 01:36:00.440]  The Southerners have to be dealt with. They must have their guns taken. He will be our
[01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:05.580]  new Lincoln. I mean, this is the battle plan. And you're like, whoa, Southerner, I just
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:09.420]  want freedom. What's this about Southerner? You're gonna be the Southerner, all whites
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:15.260]  nationwide. You're the enemy, you did it. Unless you join us, well, okay, guns are bad.
[01:36:15.260 --> 01:36:20.020]  I join you, I admit I'm evil. Meanwhile, they're so politically correct, you can't have a job
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:22.980]  with a hut toy, that must mean he's an Arab.
[01:36:22.980 --> 01:36:26.620]  As Ashenon is saying, I'm the Goblin King, or Rush Limbaugh is. And they're talking about
[01:36:26.620 --> 01:36:35.360]  going after Lego in Europe because of the new Lego set I just covered. Notice how you
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.780]  can't draw a gun. You can't have a bubble projector that looks like a gun with Hello
[01:36:39.780 --> 01:36:45.500]  Kitty. You can't have that. But we're gonna kill you, Piers Morgan says, and his other
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:46.620]  host.
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.420]  And we're gonna take your rights, and we're buying 1.6 billion bullets and militarizing
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:56.660]  police in black uniforms, marching like stormtroopers and federalizing everything. But we're liberal
[01:36:56.660 --> 01:37:02.560]  and sweet, and you're a scumbag white person. I mean, they have white guys on, you've seen
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:06.260]  them on MSNBC, going whites are scum, southerners are trash.
[01:37:06.260 --> 01:37:11.580]  I mean, that's real bigoted attacks, real division. And a lot of whites are like, well,
[01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:18.060]  I wasn't racist, I got a lot of friends. But man, okay, you're saying it's a race war?
[01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:22.500]  You're making me do this? It's like prison. They send you to prison, it's how Wacken Hut
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.140]  and all other big correction systems have it.
[01:37:25.140 --> 01:37:28.900]  And it's shut up where, okay, you're white, you go in the white area. You're like, well,
[01:37:28.900 --> 01:37:32.660]  why do I go there? Well, you're gonna get killed if you don't. You're gonna get beat
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:36.660]  up, at least raped. You get in, they go, all right, we are the white supreme brotherhood,
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:41.700]  or we're the Aryan nations, or we're the brotherhood of Krom or whatever.
[01:37:41.700 --> 01:37:45.000]  And you're gonna deal drugs for us, and you're gonna do all this, or we're gonna let those
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:51.140]  folks kill you. And you've got the white supremacists, the black supremacists, the Hispanic supremacists,
[01:37:51.140 --> 01:37:55.340]  on the east and west coast, the Asian supremacists. Four different blocks in the prison, and they
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:37:59.380]  all go to the warden, and the drugs are brought in, and the whole thing's run that way.
[01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:02.300]  And if they want somebody politically killed, they just say, go ahead and take that guy
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:08.060]  out. Go ahead and take that guy out. And see, it's a prison culture. I mean, I see it on
[01:38:08.060 --> 01:38:12.580]  YouTube about, you don't wanna deal with the blacks and the Jews and kill them. They're
[01:38:12.580 --> 01:38:17.020]  gonna kill us. You're working for them. Yeah, I learned that. You go to their website or
[01:38:17.020 --> 01:38:20.220]  their YouTube channel, and you'll hear them bragging, yeah, I've been in the pen for ten
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:21.220]  years for armed robbery.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:24.820]  I don't know how to deal with it. I mean, I know who you guys are when I hear you, cuz
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:28.580]  you always talk about, yeah, I'd like to get you and rape you. It's always the standard,
[01:38:28.580 --> 01:38:34.900]  I'm gonna rape you, cuz you're an ex-con, okay? You were put into a college to be brainwashed,
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:41.660]  and you're tough cuz you got the prison tats and even, it's all social engineering.
[01:38:41.660 --> 01:38:47.260]  See, I know how it all works. It's the same thing with the Mexican extremists. You don't
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:53.100]  like it, we're taking over. When we get you, we're gonna rape you, Whitey. You're a convict.
[01:38:53.100 --> 01:39:00.060]  See, my guns are to protect me from the government and their convict armies that they run. And
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:04.380]  they run all the capos, the white supremacists they run, the black supremacists, the Mexican
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:06.740]  supremacists, all government funded.
[01:39:06.740 --> 01:39:10.620]  It's all come out on record, all of it, all of it. You're all government, you're a disgusting
[01:39:10.620 --> 01:39:15.220]  disgrace. You're pathetic. You don't care about humankind, and it's all done under political
[01:39:15.220 --> 01:39:22.060]  correctness. All this racial harmony crud is absolute bull to make middle class, wealthy
[01:39:22.060 --> 01:39:26.780]  people. No matter what color you are, be all, I'm conforming, I'm not in part of any of
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:28.980]  all this racial stuff that's going on.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:32.820]  I'm going to, okay, I said I go to your calls, I'm going to them right now. William, John,
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:38.540]  George, Jerome, Truth, Raider, and others, but this is what's going on. This is what's
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:42.380]  going on. I mean, I was at the airport about a year ago, a year and a half ago, flying
[01:39:42.380 --> 01:39:43.380]  back from the talker's conference.
[01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:47.380]  I don't think I've ever even told this story. Actually, I have, but Rob Dew was there. And
[01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:52.820]  I guess this guy who I was, and he was a big white guy, tats all over him. I could tell
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:56.700]  convict type guy, and he comes over. He gets to my face, obviously knew who I was, it was
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:00.540]  some kind of setup, and grabs my breast.
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:06.420]  That's what he called them, my pectorals, and twist them trying to get a response. And
[01:40:06.420 --> 01:40:10.340]  I knew it was a setup, and I could see cops and stuff about 50 feet away. I was like,
[01:40:10.340 --> 01:40:17.340]  okay, this is all a setup. And he goes, I'd like to get you, I'd like to rape you.
[01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:23.020]  And I'm like, wow, they got a convict waiting for me at the Austin airport knowing I'm getting
[01:40:23.020 --> 01:40:28.140]  off. I mean, I guess I do gotta get bodyguards just to watch my back, just so people can't
[01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:36.860]  come up and do that. And he grabs me, total convict stuff, twist the skin on my pectorals,
[01:40:36.860 --> 01:40:37.860]  twist them.
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:43.540]  And then goes, I'd like to get you, I'd like to rape you. And he, I'd rape you. And that's
[01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:47.420]  who they are. That's who they are. That's who they are. That's what they want. They
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:52.060]  want to dominate, they want to control. They can't invent things. They don't know beauty.
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:55.500]  They don't know strength. They don't know family. They never had a family. Their daddy
[01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:56.500]  beat them.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:41:00.820]  They sat in a crib with flies all over them while mama smoked crack, or while mama did
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:04.460]  methamphetamine. And then they grew up and went to prison and learned to be a tough guy.
[01:41:04.460 --> 01:41:09.380]  And now that's all they've got. I've got justice on my side. I would have climbed up on top
[01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:14.020]  of that guy and just rub his head right like that. You understand that, boy? You think
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:15.020]  you're tough?
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:18.940]  The devil doesn't give you strength. Life gives you strength. You're weak and you're
[01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:24.340]  empty. And you grew up in crap filled diapers and I grew up with love. And that's why you
[01:41:24.340 --> 01:41:28.780]  think evil's giving you strength, because you're a pathetic little boy. All of you who
[01:41:28.780 --> 01:41:33.660]  serve evil, you're a joke. Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls. William in New
[01:41:33.660 --> 01:41:36.700]  York, you're on the air.
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:41.740]  That is good, Alex. I appreciate that. Listen, man, my family and I pray for you and your
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:46.740]  family every day. I appreciate everything you're doing for everybody. But listen, we're
[01:41:46.740 --> 01:41:52.060]  in a hell of a jam here in New York. I mean, I'm getting sick of it. What do you suggest
[01:41:52.060 --> 01:41:55.260]  that, I mean, I know what I'm gonna do, but what do you suggest that people in New York
[01:41:55.260 --> 01:41:56.260]  do about what's coming down?
[01:41:56.260 --> 01:42:00.460]  I have to say we had a lot of affiliates in New York, great people in the big cities,
[01:42:00.460 --> 01:42:04.940]  but also in the rural areas. I would leave. Or I would get super aggressive and try to
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:10.780]  repeal it, but exodus is always the best thing. And then, of course, they'll corner you somewhere
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:17.060]  else. But I'm not a big fan of the small community that tries to go to the local system with
[01:42:17.060 --> 01:42:20.140]  bargaining power to be left alone.
[01:42:20.140 --> 01:42:25.420]  I think it's good to go to areas where people know about liberty and you know there's a
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:33.320]  lot of liberty lovers. And so that will percolate out into the system. I would do like a lot
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:36.660]  of New Yorkers are doing. Come to Texas, man. The New Yorkers I meet down here in Texas
[01:42:36.660 --> 01:42:40.900]  are all great people. Californians are great people, but the really nasty ones are the
[01:42:40.900 --> 01:42:42.740]  socialists from California.
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:46.780]  And they've just overrun everything and are trying to take over. And they even talk about
[01:42:46.780 --> 01:42:52.620]  that. I mean, the agenda 21 shows a triangle map of San Antonio, Austin up to Dallas and
[01:42:52.620 --> 01:42:57.020]  Fort Worth and Houston. And they say we are taking these areas over. And they go into
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:01.980]  government, they go into the meetings, they are there as brutal authoritarians to take
[01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:03.800]  control.
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:07.540]  Wearing their camouflage of being liberals. What do you think of Feinstein as saying we're
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:09.540]  going to phase out your guns?
[01:43:09.540 --> 01:43:14.340]  I hate it. I hate it to death. I mean, talking is over, Alex. I mean, I know you talk a lot
[01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:19.940]  about handling things through activism, rioting, protest, things of that nature. But I mean,
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:25.380]  come on, talk is over. I mean, the talk key time, the only thing these barbarians understand
[01:43:25.380 --> 01:43:26.380]  is aggression.
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:31.500]  Listen, I hear that, but they're losing politically. Obama wasn't really elected. They ran a fake
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:35.660]  guy against him. I'm seeing the numbers. A lot of you aren't public figures, you don't
[01:43:35.660 --> 01:43:41.380]  know. I mean, I go sit in the hot spring on the Texas-Mexico border with 15 people wearing
[01:43:41.380 --> 01:43:43.140]  a ball cap.
[01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:47.860]  And one person hears my voice and goes, Alex Jones, next person, Alex Jones, Alex Jones,
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:53.100]  they were from New York, California, San Antonio, France. I come back the next day to the hot
[01:43:53.100 --> 01:43:58.620]  springs. Most of the people knew who I was. Everywhere I went, I'd be talking up on a
[01:43:58.620 --> 01:44:02.100]  mountaintop and somebody 50 feet down would go, is that Alex Jones?
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.740]  And I mean, let me tell you, the globalists are going for it all right now because they're
[01:44:05.740 --> 01:44:09.500]  a paper tiger. And I'm not bragging, hey, I'm this big shot, everybody knows who I am.
[01:44:09.500 --> 01:44:13.940]  If people know who I am and then say they agree with me, black, white, Hispanic, doesn't
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:19.020]  matter, it shows. Now, obviously, that's gonna be a higher educated group that knows how
[01:44:19.020 --> 01:44:22.340]  to go find a hot springs in the middle of the desert somewhere.
[01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:27.580]  It's gonna be a more educated group climbing 8,000 foot mountains. But where you go and
[01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:32.620]  there's like middle class, upper middle class, but also some areas of blue collar. Where
[01:44:32.620 --> 01:44:38.060]  you find highly educated liberal idiots, they will spout Marxism and not even know it's
[01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:43.340]  Karl Marx. And they're in their own world, man, and they are openly saying Obama is Lincoln
[01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.940]  and is going to conquer us.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:49.060]  You can look it up, I mean, they're coming. So I hear what you're saying, but they wanna,
[01:44:49.060 --> 01:44:53.860]  they provocateur events like Oklahoma City because they can't win the cultural debate
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:45:00.100]  with us. So whoever fires first loses, that's why they're gonna fire and say we did it or
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:03.660]  push people into a corner and get them to fire, okay?
[01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:08.900]  So it's like, I don't want it to go to the shooting war, they want it to. So does that
[01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:11.860]  tell you a shooting war is a good thing, William?
[01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:16.820]  I'm really frustrated with the pain for our catered weapons and more security.
[01:45:16.820 --> 01:45:23.700]  What would have happened when that guy grabbed my pectorals and tried to rip my, well, you
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:27.820]  know what they're called, I'm gonna stand on radio. Did a you know what twister on me.
[01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:33.260]  What would have happened if I would have attacked the convict?
[01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:38.860]  Yeah, that wouldn't end well. Yeah, no, no, they were gonna have their victory. They had
[01:45:38.860 --> 01:45:42.140]  a convict and it's on record, the police were ready to arrest him after the whole stage
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:43.140]  thing happened.
[01:45:43.140 --> 01:45:49.700]  He was like, what? Hey guys, come on, it was a wink wink. But I was smart enough cuz the
[01:45:49.700 --> 01:45:52.980]  cops that were there watching it, they left when it happened and I didn't take the bait.
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:56.180]  And then I went and called the TSA all that freaked out and was watching and called other
[01:45:56.180 --> 01:45:58.940]  people and this all happened on record.
[01:45:58.940 --> 01:46:02.860]  That's why that, well, anyways, it's a side issue, but they don't like me too much over
[01:46:02.860 --> 01:46:06.460]  there. I have to go to the lion's den every time I fly. I mean, they were planning, see,
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:11.580]  I knew, I mean, it hurt when the guy did it, it hurt real bad. He grabbed and twisted as
[01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:13.420]  hard as he could, a full grown man.
[01:46:13.420 --> 01:46:17.500]  And I just cut off the pain and went, what's your problem? You're gonna get in a lot of
[01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:20.380]  trouble for that. He couldn't believe I just stood there totally calmly. I just turned
[01:46:20.380 --> 01:46:27.820]  it off. Okay, just turn the pain off. So what are you gonna do? And then he called me a
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:31.580]  wimp and said he was gonna rape me and all this waiting for me to do something.
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:38.340]  And again, ABC Nightline implied that I have fake anger. No, I just let myself, where I'm
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:42.500]  somewhat safe here, then I can show you what I really think. But out there, I know when
[01:46:42.500 --> 01:46:46.120]  to hold them, I know when to fold them, I know when to walk away, I know when to run.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:49.140]  You never count your money when you're sitting at the table. There'll be time enough for
[01:46:49.140 --> 01:46:53.100]  counting when the dealing's done. And the money I'm after is liberty. The goal I'm after
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:55.020]  is freedom and defeating these globalists.
[01:46:55.020 --> 01:47:00.620]  I take it personal, the children they brain damage with vaccines and GMO. I take it personal,
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:05.080]  the children they abort. I take it personal, cuz you know why? It is personal. I'm a human
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:11.260]  being and I have an allegiance to humanity and the God that created us. God gives you
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:14.540]  life and joy and children and everything wholesome.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:19.220]  The devil gives you death and destruction and poverty and pain. And the New World Order
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:24.020]  is the devil. Let's go ahead and talk to John in Pennsylvania. You're on the air.
[01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:29.980]  Hey, Alex, thanks for listening to me. I just wanna thank you for being who you are and
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:32.060]  also all those info warriors out there.
[01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:34.140]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:39.540]  Basically, what I was calling about is just, I'm just sticking here and all this spin.
[01:47:39.540 --> 01:47:45.180]  And they keep on comparing the United States with other countries. I think, first of all,
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:49.620]  the United States became the great country that it is today because of what we stand
[01:47:49.620 --> 01:47:52.420]  for, not what other countries stand for.
[01:47:52.420 --> 01:47:58.140]  Absolutely. I mean, did you go read the Daily Beast article that said, peers pressure? Or
[01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:01.340]  it said it's good to have the Chinese and the Russians and peers telling us what to
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:02.340]  do.
[01:48:02.340 --> 01:48:07.580]  This is globalization 2.0. Let Alex prepare his flamethrower. We're coming for him. And
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:12.140]  the ABC Nightline says Alex is now under very serious scrutiny. And they're saying they
[01:48:12.140 --> 01:48:18.100]  wanna kill me and that my kids hope they're safe at night. I mean, that's who they are.
[01:48:18.100 --> 01:48:22.740]  Look, guys, I know you're a bunch of gangster thugs or a bunch of wannabes. I get that I'm
[01:48:22.740 --> 01:48:28.660]  in danger. And that's the point. I know America is in danger. And yes, they're trying to get
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:32.860]  us used to foreigners telling us what to do under global government.
[01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:39.740]  Yep. Also, also the fact is that, you know, they're using the oldest strategy, the divide
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:44.580]  and conquer, you know, mind, body, spirit. We've been hit with that. I mean, I hate to
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:48.860]  be redundant, but you've said it time and time again. As far as everyone who's listening,
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:53.540]  the ones that are awake need to wake up the ones that are sleeping. And the spin is the
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:57.660]  way they're doing it, divide and conquer. They wanna keep on pulling the Americans away
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:49:02.220]  from each other. And we have to keep on using our voices and get out there and support our
[01:49:02.220 --> 01:49:08.020]  local gun shops and speak to our neighbors and get out there and not text.
[01:49:08.020 --> 01:49:12.100]  Because if we're using the technology, don't take it from us, too.
[01:49:12.100 --> 01:49:18.100]  Well, we need to engage with the latest technology, but also engage with low tech and build multiple
[01:49:18.100 --> 01:49:22.540]  pillars, multiple tentacles against the enemy. We need to move against them on every front
[01:49:22.540 --> 01:49:26.700]  as they've moved against us. Listen, if somebody doesn't sell so-called semi-autos, assault
[01:49:26.700 --> 01:49:31.340]  rifles, boycott them. I mean, I'll never go into exporting goods again.
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:37.780]  And I've been in there and bought stuff. I will never support anybody. I mean, here's
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:42.780]  the article, NRA Boycott Kills Outdoor Show That Banned Assault Weapons. The massive boycotts
[01:49:42.780 --> 01:49:47.700]  sparked by NRA and other gun rights outraged by the nation's largest outdoor show.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:51.300]  Banned the exhibition of assault weapons has caused the show organizers to abruptly cancel
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:55.500]  the week-long event in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. It's gone on forever. It's the Reed exhibitions.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:02.780]  I mean, it's over. And listen, they want to intimidate us, take our language. I mean,
[01:50:02.780 --> 01:50:06.580]  how mad does it make you? I don't care where you live. I mean, I always see these comments
[01:50:06.580 --> 01:50:10.660]  in YouTube going, you dumb southerner, Texan, you pathetic gun owner.
[01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:13.820]  And I always see folks, I'm from New York, I'm from California. It isn't about being
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:18.060]  a southerner owning guns. See how they try to play that game and then say southerners
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:23.700]  are racist. I mean, southerners, I mean, how many blacks in the South own guns? It's all
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:30.860]  over generalizations. Can you imagine if I came out and said New Yorkers are scum, I
[01:50:30.860 --> 01:50:32.500]  mean, what the media would do with that?
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:37.100]  Imagine they're on TV calling everybody in the South scum. What do you make of that?
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:42.980]  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, what I'm saying is basically as far as like they got to stop
[01:50:42.980 --> 01:50:47.340]  these puppets. They think these puppets think that they've had loss. They don't know what
[01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:50.740]  loss is until they've seen it, because I've seen it.
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:55.260]  I've watched my family systematically get killed in another country.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:58.020]  I want to hear this from you when we come back. I want to hear about your family. Stay
[01:50:58.020 --> 01:51:01.020]  there.
[01:51:01.020 --> 01:51:05.860]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive? From natural disasters
[01:51:05.860 --> 01:51:10.460]  like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[01:51:10.460 --> 01:51:15.380]  by a disastrous economy. Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods
[01:51:15.380 --> 01:51:19.620]  Direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather a life storm
[01:51:19.620 --> 01:51:24.140]  by having a supply of food on hand. After Hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:29.820]  wrote, almost all the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just in time
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:34.580]  to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early
[01:51:34.580 --> 01:51:39.180]  than one day too late. I can warn you, but I can't feed you. Heed the warnings and do

[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:04.380]  My name is Steven Heuer. After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that
[01:52:04.380 --> 01:52:09.100]  most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage. So
[01:52:09.100 --> 01:52:13.200]  whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:17.580]  like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's
[01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:22.620]  brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification. One World Way supports your body's number
[01:52:22.620 --> 01:52:28.060]  one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production. My name is Angie and my son has
[01:52:28.060 --> 01:52:33.460]  suffered from borderline autism and constipation. I got him on One World Way and in two months
[01:52:33.460 --> 01:52:38.380]  his constipation is gone. He's become friendlier. He can carry on a normal conversation with
[01:52:38.380 --> 01:52:42.860]  me and he has made his first friend. He's doing great and he looks forward to taking
[01:52:42.860 --> 01:52:48.220]  One World Way every day. You could offer him a present or a cake and he would prefer the
[01:52:48.220 --> 01:52:57.300]  One World Way. Go to OneWorldWay.com. That's OneWorldW-H-E-Y.com or call 888-988-3325.

[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:13.420]  furnished cabin with all amenities, Wi-Fi, executive food and wine, and laundry service awaits.
[01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:19.580]  After a good night's sleep, your adventure begins. You're on a golden stag safari for

[01:54:25.180 --> 01:54:34.060]  We're back live. We're gonna go back to John and then George, Jerome, Truth, Raider. We'll
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:38.380]  get to all of you before our guest comes on. Briefly, I wanna do a big roll out on this
[01:54:38.380 --> 01:54:46.340]  tomorrow. This has been two years in development. A anti fluoride filter and heavy metal filter
[01:54:46.340 --> 01:54:55.620]  in the regular silver-based ceramic filter in one. And if you go to Infowarsstore.com,
[01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:57.900]  you can see the roll out with Propure.
[01:54:57.900 --> 01:55:02.620]  By the way, we're discounting at 10% out of the gates. Normally, people don't do that.
[01:55:02.620 --> 01:55:05.660]  And we don't do like Walmart where we increase the price and then discount it to say it's
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:12.980]  a discount or others have been caught doing. You can get the new all-in-one filters made
[01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:17.460]  in England, developed by scientists here in the United States. This is what I use. It
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:25.500]  has just come out. It is amazing. No priming required. The new filters are available. It's
[01:55:25.500 --> 01:55:28.500]  called ProOne from Propure.
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:35.060]  And it fits into all of your Propure units. No one else has this. And it also takes out
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:39.900]  the hydrofluorosolic acid base that the other filters don't. And all the scientific data
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:44.420]  and side-by-side comparisons are up on the site and the studies. And it also cuts out
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:52.540]  the sodium hexafluorosilicate, which is the real stuff they're putting in the water.
[01:55:52.540 --> 01:55:56.160]  The truth is most other fluoride filters, and we've sold these too, only reduce it and
[01:55:56.160 --> 01:56:02.380]  they don't get out a lot of the acid-based systems. But this does. It's the new Propure
[01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:07.460]  ProOne available at Infowarsstore.com. And your purchase supports the broadcast or call
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:16.500]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139. Two years in development. In fact, I was first talking to Propure when
[01:56:16.500 --> 01:56:20.580]  they were starting this development. It took them two years to get it all certified, made.
[01:56:20.580 --> 01:56:24.220]  They can only get it made in England because of the high-tech process. England's always
[01:56:24.220 --> 01:56:27.380]  been at the top of the chain when it comes to water purification because their empire
[01:56:27.380 --> 01:56:28.380]  needed purified water.
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:32.460]  The point is they've got the factories that can make this. So designed in the US, made
[01:56:32.460 --> 01:56:38.020]  in England, and it's available right now at Infowarsstore.com. Okay, tell folks, and I've
[01:56:38.020 --> 01:56:44.820]  talked to so many people from Ukraine, people from China, people from other areas of Eastern
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:49.380]  Europe, where they come and take the guns, and then next, your family starts disappearing.
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:53.780]  Stalin did that, took them to the 30s to start getting the guns, and then it was a mass culling.
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:55.260]  Tell folks what happened to your family.
[01:56:55.260 --> 01:57:01.600]  Okay, Alex, all I can say is the cost of disarming the people psychologically, physically, spiritually
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:08.180]  is staggering. And those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it because
[01:57:08.180 --> 01:57:13.860]  I've experienced it myself, and the government is probably, you know, although they've given
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:18.140]  me a new identity here in the United States, and I always promised myself I would never
[01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:22.540]  get involved, but it's come to this where I need to speak out because my children's
[01:57:22.540 --> 01:57:28.360]  future are at stake. But, I mean, they're hoping that, you know, those who have died
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:33.420]  in the Vietnam War and those who are still alive are maybe too old to fight, but guess
[01:57:33.420 --> 01:57:38.540]  what? There's still voices out there, and I'm one of the voices that, I've experienced
[01:57:38.540 --> 01:57:39.540]  it.
[01:57:39.540 --> 01:57:41.540]  What happened to your family?
[01:57:41.540 --> 01:57:47.820]  Well, my grandfather was assassinated, and my whole family, we're only three of us that
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:52.260]  are survivors here in the United States, but all of them were systematically killed trying
[01:57:52.260 --> 01:57:58.940]  to leave the country, trying to speak up for their rights, and basically, you know, it's
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:03.540]  terrible. And if people don't wake up now to see this, they're gonna be-
[01:58:03.540 --> 01:58:06.580]  Where were you, Eastern Europe, Middle East, Asia?
[01:58:06.580 --> 01:58:08.700]  Oh, yeah, Vietnam.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:14.340]  Vietnam, oh, so your family was trying to get out, what, in the early 70s?
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:17.580]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:17.580 --> 01:58:22.380]  And was this after they left Saigon, or was this before you couldn't get out?
[01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:27.940]  This is after, or actually at the end of the, where they were starting to pull out everyone.
[01:58:27.940 --> 01:58:33.420]  And of course, for those that don't know that they said, the North Vietnamese, turn your
[01:58:33.420 --> 01:58:37.020]  guns in, we'll give you amnesty. What happened when you turned the guns in? We're gonna come
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.500]  back to you after this.

[01:59:50.140 --> 02:00:05.580]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:12.620]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:23.660]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.660 --> 02:00:28.780]  Coming up in the start of the next segment, James O'Keefe of the Veritas Project. You
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:32.540]  know him from bringing down A-Kern and so much more. Going to be joining us. We're taking
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:36.580]  a few more of your calls right now. You know, they took the guns in Turkey and then killed
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:40.740]  over a million Armenians after they took their guns. That's just one of the smaller cases.
[02:00:40.740 --> 02:00:44.900]  Paul Pot, the list goes on and on. Hitler, Stalin. But you're saying your family was
[02:00:44.900 --> 02:00:50.460]  in southern Vietnam after the US pullout. And I've read the history. Tell people briefly,
[02:00:50.460 --> 02:00:54.460]  John, then we'll go to others. The history of what happened. Because I remember reading,
[02:00:54.460 --> 02:00:58.420]  they told people turn your guns in, we'll give you an amnesty, everything's fine. What
[02:00:58.420 --> 02:01:00.420]  happened once the guns were turned in?
[02:01:00.420 --> 02:01:06.820]  Well, they systematically started killing everyone that was against the government.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:15.300]  Basically I was born in Da Nang and my grandfather was a politician there and he was killed publicly.
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:24.980]  And the rest of our family was killed for being part of the family. It's just the loss.
[02:01:24.980 --> 02:01:29.140]  People don't realize the loss that they're gonna experience if they follow through and
[02:01:29.140 --> 02:01:31.180]  they don't speak up now and pull together.
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:35.700]  By the way, I've been around all these so-called leftists. They say the plan is to kill us
[02:01:35.700 --> 02:01:39.580]  once they get our guns. I mean, these are monsters. These are not liberals.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:44.460]  The war's already been on. You're absolutely right. I mean, they've been working on us
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:49.380]  psychologically, spiritually, and physically. And as an educator, I'm telling you, I know
[02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:55.060]  I work with IDD children. And I'm telling you, there's no way in heck a couple that
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:59.060]  are healthy and everything, and they keep on telling you that, oh, it's genetics. It's
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.060]  not genetics.
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:04.780]  There's something that they're doing. It's a slow kill. And this is a culling, cull,
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:11.660]  whatever you like. But it's a depopulation program that has been going on for years.
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:17.220]  And it's ridiculous. And I'm just at the point where the best defense right now is to speak
[02:02:17.220 --> 02:02:22.940]  out and everybody needs to get out and talk to your neighbors and get everybody on board.
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:27.860]  No, you're right. The globalists are all obsessed with organic and purified water. They won't
[02:02:27.860 --> 02:02:33.260]  eat anything, the GMO, the vaccines. It's all a giant eugenics operation. God bless
[02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:36.580]  you, and thanks for your testimony. George in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding here on
[02:02:36.580 --> 02:02:41.300]  the air. Go ahead. What do you think of Feinstein and Cummings for all the semi-autos and more?
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:47.020]  I'd like to cover one other thing first. On the vaccines, the government has a website,
[02:02:47.020 --> 02:02:55.300]  Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, VAERS at HHS.gov, where if you have problems with
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.960]  the vaccine, you're supposed to report it.
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:01.460]  But no one knows that, so they don't report it. Or if they do, they try to cover it up
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:02.460]  quietly, yes.
[02:03:02.460 --> 02:03:06.500]  You might have a link on your site. One other thing about the vaccines, there's a group
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:15.020]  of mostly physicians with vaccine-damaged children, autism.com. That's Autism Research
[02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:18.900]  Institute and it has a lot of listings there on things you can do when the kids do get
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:25.300]  damaged with vaccines, how to recover them, at least partially.
[02:03:25.300 --> 02:03:32.100]  Second thing is we need to group together. I agree with that. And I think maybe political
[02:03:32.100 --> 02:03:36.180]  correctness on your part would be a good thing. How about a constitutional recovery fund or
[02:03:36.180 --> 02:03:42.340]  something to curb the illegal activities of the judges and the politicians?
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:45.500]  We still have a process in place and I think we could be using it if you-
[02:03:45.500 --> 02:03:51.420]  Well, look, they're on the news saying all gun owners are racist scum. The entire South
[02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:55.940]  is filth, but then they're the politically correct people. No, they're a bunch of political
[02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:59.660]  monsters obsessing on race cuz they use it as a weapon.
[02:03:59.660 --> 02:04:05.000]  I mean, Lego can't even put out Jabba the Hutt toys now without the Muslims in Europe
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:12.260]  saying it's racist. I mean, this is a way to attack us and tell us we're bad. And I'm
[02:04:12.260 --> 02:04:17.980]  not bashing Muslims in general, the politically correct type. This is a cultural domination.
[02:04:17.980 --> 02:04:22.340]  And then they're like, hey, be nice, have some hospitality, let the globalists run over
[02:04:22.340 --> 02:04:23.340]  you.
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:26.900]  We've got to get angry and get out of a cowed position. They're always telling us we're
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:31.820]  suspect, we're racist, we're bad, we have guilt, we've done something wrong. Give them
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:37.420]  control because we're bad. Let them in, let them boss us, give us their money. They're
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:42.140]  intimidating us until we get into them.
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:46.260]  Because the government's run by a bunch of raging criminals. And I hear you, I don't
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:50.140]  know how it's politically correct to have a constitution recovery fund. Okay, our guest
[02:04:50.140 --> 02:04:54.220]  is coming up, most of you know who they are, I'm just so excited to get them on. James
[02:04:54.220 --> 02:05:01.300]  O'Keefe, the Veritas project straight ahead. Stay with us.

[02:08:20.740 --> 02:08:27.020]  patriots worldwide Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central, blasting out on XM
[02:08:27.020 --> 02:08:32.960]  over 140 a.m. and having affiliates the internet at info wars.com and prison planet.com streaming
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:40.860]  video at prison planet.tv and info wars, nightly news info wars news.com. Now I got to play
[02:08:40.860 --> 02:08:45.380]  a few clips to introduce this guy and for whatever reason over the years I tried to
[02:08:45.380 --> 02:08:52.380]  get him on, didn't get connected, but we've got him on now.
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:58.140]  And everybody listening probably knows who this individual is or you know his work and
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:09:03.220]  this is the model. I've done a lot of similar things over the years when I was just out
[02:09:03.220 --> 02:09:09.100]  doing investigations, but none of them ever exploded like this. But we had some big victories.
[02:09:09.100 --> 02:09:14.500]  And this guy and his team is the model. In fact, I just want to say on air, I haven't
[02:09:14.500 --> 02:09:19.220]  told him this shit. He ought to make a how to be a real muckraking journalist for Liberty.
[02:09:19.220 --> 02:09:25.380]  He'll make a film about it, showing how it's done because what he does, the corrupt that
[02:09:25.380 --> 02:09:30.260]  run this system and I've said this for many years. You can, let me introduce our guest
[02:09:30.260 --> 02:09:32.680]  here in a moment and play some clips first.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:38.220]  You can go and fight the globalist, the collectivist, especially Democrats for whatever reason.
[02:09:38.220 --> 02:09:42.760]  You can go follow them in their car when they're doing corrupt things and they will always
[02:09:42.760 --> 02:09:47.540]  be doing something horrible. I mean, it's hard to not catch them. I've caught bribery
[02:09:47.540 --> 02:09:52.540]  at the state capitol, just goes on everywhere, paying guys cash. The bill got defeated. It
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:57.900]  was in the front page of the newspaper and that was back in 1999, just type in Alex Jones
[02:09:57.900 --> 02:09:59.020]  catches bribery.
[02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:06.060]  I've done more than 50 or 60 things just like this. Not because I'm some great investigator,
[02:10:06.060 --> 02:10:13.020]  the corrupt do this right out in front of you, okay? The corrupt do this right out in
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:19.140]  front of you and you've just got to go out and expose them and have the courage. But
[02:10:19.140 --> 02:10:21.340]  if we just engage these people, it's over.
[02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:26.220]  James O'Keefe is the president of Project Veritas. I was saying Veritas Project, no
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:31.780]  teleprompter. James O'Keefe is a graduate of Rutgers University. He has received a congressional
[02:10:31.780 --> 02:10:36.540]  resolution praising him for his work and a receipt, a recipient of the Robert Novak Award
[02:10:36.540 --> 02:10:38.860]  for journalistic excellence.
[02:10:38.860 --> 02:10:45.460]  He's best well known for the 2009 Acorn investigation, which exposed systematic corruption in multiple
[02:10:45.460 --> 02:10:49.540]  offices, different cities, different areas. You walk in and go, I have an underage prostitute
[02:10:49.540 --> 02:10:52.780]  I snuck in the country. We're gonna play a clip of that. And I want to sell her out.
[02:10:52.780 --> 02:10:56.960]  How do I keep her under the radar? Well, just make sure you put her in school so the government
[02:10:56.960 --> 02:11:03.660]  gets theirs, but everything's fine. Gonna pimp her good. And forced the group to be
[02:11:03.660 --> 02:11:07.020]  disbanded, losing them millions of dollars a year, and that was one of their big syndicate
[02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:08.020]  takeovers.
[02:11:08.020 --> 02:11:14.180]  He's also exposed to NPR. The sting involved NPR executive Ron Shiller and senior director
[02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:20.580]  Betsy Lilly. The two agreed to receive 5 million donation from a fictitious Muslim organization.
[02:11:20.580 --> 02:11:24.820]  The two executives later resigned. The House of Representatives voted to defund NPR. And
[02:11:24.820 --> 02:11:29.520]  again, folks, people don't believe I snuck into Bohemian Grove. They just can't believe
[02:11:29.520 --> 02:11:31.140]  I got in there and did it.
[02:11:31.140 --> 02:11:38.260]  You've never tried things. People can't believe. You have power is my point. That's what I
[02:11:38.260 --> 02:11:42.300]  want you to understand. You are the ones that are gonna defeat these people. And the model
[02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:49.100]  is somebody like James O'Keefe. The project veritas.org, theprojectveritas.org. And of
[02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:53.680]  course it's supported by patriots like you, so go there and do that.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:58.100]  Through Project Veritas, James has personally trained and equipped dozens of citizen journalists
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:03.780]  in an effort to create transparency in government and spending. And of course, that's what their
[02:12:03.780 --> 02:12:07.840]  job is. But I'm saying put it out to everybody, which I know they've done some of. Now let's
[02:12:07.840 --> 02:12:09.540]  play something he's not well known for.
[02:12:09.540 --> 02:12:14.160]  And since then, there's new clips of Christians going up to abortionist and saying, hey, let
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:19.120]  us adopt the babies. And they go, you don't want the ugly black babies. But you're racist
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.500]  if you don't want them aborted. Remember that, cuz it's racist, don't wanna save them. And
[02:12:22.500 --> 02:12:25.860]  it's racist if you don't like the communist Chinese and apple suicide nets if you wanna
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:28.580]  save the Chinese little girls.
[02:12:28.580 --> 02:12:32.500]  You're liberal if you just let them all die. See, the liberals are eugenicist. I made the
[02:12:32.500 --> 02:12:36.260]  film Endgame, exposing that. So let's go to this first clip, then a short clip of the
[02:12:36.260 --> 02:12:42.740]  next, then we'll do the rest of the hour with our guests. But it's so exciting, okay, because
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:44.940]  I've been doing this type of thing for 17 years.
[02:12:44.940 --> 02:12:47.860]  He's been doing it, I don't know, for six, seven years. We're gonna talk to him in a
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:54.740]  moment, James O'Keefe of theprojectveritas.org. But let's go ahead and go to this first clip
[02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:59.900]  of him calling in to Planned Parenthood. This has been duplicated by others. Planned Parenthood
[02:12:59.900 --> 02:13:05.500]  was set up to, quote, kill the black weeds, Margaret Sanger, John D Rockefeller.
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:06.500]  Let's go ahead and play the clip.
[02:13:06.500 --> 02:13:36.380]  Afternoon, this is Autumn. Hello, Autumn. I mentioned making a donation today. Fantastic. What about abortions for the underprivileged minority groups? Oh, absolutely. We have, in fact, wonderful, fantastic news. We just received a very generous donation to our Women in Need fund. Wonderful. I wanna specify that abortion can help a minority group. Would that be possible? Absolutely. Like the black community, for example? Certainly. Okay. So the abortion could be, you know, I could give
[02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:41.660]  money specifically for a black baby. That would be the purpose. Yeah, absolutely. If
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:47.300]  you wanted to designate that you wanted your gift to be used to help an African American
[02:13:47.300 --> 02:13:53.180]  woman in need, then we would certainly make sure that that gift was earmarked specifically
[02:13:53.180 --> 02:13:58.020]  for that purpose. Great. Because I really face trouble with affirmative action and I
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:02.500]  don't want my kids being disadvantaged, you know, against black kids. I just had a baby.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:09.260]  I want to put it in his name, you know. So that's definitely possible. Oh, always, always.
[02:14:09.260 --> 02:14:15.780]  So I just wanted, can I put this in the name of my son? Absolutely. The name of my son,
[02:14:15.780 --> 02:14:22.980]  great. He's trying to get into colleges. All right, let's stop right there. You know, and
[02:14:22.980 --> 02:14:28.460]  you can go online and go to the Veritas project and see that report in full and others. And
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:34.340]  I have protested back when I had more time to do it. I'm protesting on air now, abortion
[02:14:34.340 --> 02:14:40.620]  clinics. And here in Austin, also in Dallas, and I've had them walk up to me and they go,
[02:14:40.620 --> 02:14:42.420]  no one wants these black babies.
[02:14:42.420 --> 02:14:46.740]  These people are a problem. And I'm telling you, most liberals at that level are not liberals.
[02:14:46.740 --> 02:14:51.060]  These are flaming racist. See, real racists aren't wearing Klan outfits. Usually those
[02:14:51.060 --> 02:14:58.340]  are feds, you know, meaning to make gun owners racist or something. The real ones are trendies.
[02:14:58.340 --> 02:15:03.140]  I want to go to our guest. We'll play the famous clip of him dressed as a 70s pimp.
[02:15:03.140 --> 02:15:07.540]  Totally obvious with an underage girl telling him she's underage. And discussing how to
[02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:12.420]  get the tax exemptions and things for his pimping operation and how to run little girls
[02:15:12.420 --> 02:15:16.980]  into the US. We've all seen that, so I won't play it now. We'll get to it later in some
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:17.980]  other clips.
[02:15:17.980 --> 02:15:22.500]  James O'Keefe, great to have you on. Again, I just salute you. You were on The Nightly
[02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:27.180]  News with Sha'Carri Jackson last week. You just heard the comments I made about liberals
[02:15:27.180 --> 02:15:31.580]  saying how much they want to kill the black people while saying all gun owners are racist
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:33.900]  against blacks.
[02:15:33.900 --> 02:15:37.700]  How did you wake up to all of this? And let's just get into where you see the state of this
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:38.900]  country right now.
[02:15:38.900 --> 02:15:43.980]  Well, Alex, I think I was going to be on your show five or six years ago. We did that Planned
[02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:50.460]  Parenthood investigation with a young woman named Lila Rose. And we called up, I'd say
[02:15:50.460 --> 02:15:56.420]  about seven or eight Planned Parenthoods across the country. And I heard about Margaret Sanger,
[02:15:56.420 --> 02:16:03.580]  who was a eugenicist back in the early part of the 20th century. And we called up these
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:07.460]  Planned Parenthoods. And right before you cut the clip, the vice president of Planned
[02:16:07.460 --> 02:16:13.620]  Parenthood actually said that it's understandable and exciting to abort black children. Because
[02:16:13.620 --> 02:16:17.060]  I said there were too many, I was acting, I said there were too many black people in
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:20.420]  this country and we need to abort them, is what I said to Planned Parenthood. And the
[02:16:20.420 --> 02:16:25.300]  vice president of Planned Parenthood resigned. And it was a national story at the time. And
[02:16:25.300 --> 02:16:29.980]  that kind of got me into thinking that the way to expose malfeasance and corruption and
[02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:36.380]  fraud is to kind of just take it right to them and make them live up to their own principles.
[02:16:36.380 --> 02:16:40.140]  And that's sort of what we do at Project Veritas. We make people live up to their own book of
[02:16:40.140 --> 02:16:44.900]  rules, which is right out of Saul Alinsky's rules for radicals.
[02:16:44.900 --> 02:16:48.620]  I remember, in fact, I interviewed people six or seven years ago about this. Have I
[02:16:48.620 --> 02:16:50.420]  interviewed you then?
[02:16:50.420 --> 02:16:54.140]  We were gonna connect and for whatever reason, we just didn't connect.
[02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:57.860]  I just remember playing the clip at the time because, listen, it's not like you're trying
[02:16:57.860 --> 02:17:02.340]  to find a four-leaf clover and there's only a few of them that are eugenicist. I'm saying
[02:17:02.340 --> 02:17:08.260]  about 80% of mid-level or higher ups I run into will go, listen, we gotta get rid of
[02:17:08.260 --> 02:17:12.140]  these black people. Stop protesting. What's wrong with you? You're white.
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:16.260]  And now more and more videos of that have surfaced. You don't want ugly black babies.
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:20.920]  The point is, I want the left out there, the mainline left who's idiots to understand.
[02:17:20.920 --> 02:17:24.340]  These people are monsters. Go ahead.
[02:17:24.340 --> 02:17:29.620]  We found it. I mean, it's all on tape. I let the people speak for themselves. We call the
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:34.980]  New Mexico Clinic. This is Planned Parenthood, New Mexico. And when I said, and I'm acting,
[02:17:34.980 --> 02:17:39.660]  of course, I'm acting like a racist, and I say, well, you know, it's just, it's terrible
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:44.820]  what's going on in our country with black people and affirmative action. And this Planned
[02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:49.780]  Parenthood vice president said to me in New Mexico, she said, it's a strange time for
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:55.260]  sure. And this is what she's caught on tape saying when she does not know that she's being
[02:17:55.260 --> 02:17:59.940]  videotaped. And it really cuts to the heart and soul. Why do they put all the clinics
[02:17:59.940 --> 02:18:04.980]  in the inner city neighborhoods? And what's really remarkable, Alex, is that the media
[02:18:04.980 --> 02:18:10.720]  tries to ignore it. But the good thing about Project Veritas is we, because we get results,
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:15.160]  because these people resign or they're forced to resign, the Associated Press does not have
[02:18:15.160 --> 02:18:19.580]  a choice but to write coverage about it. And that's how it kind of gets it. And Lila has
[02:18:19.580 --> 02:18:24.460]  gone on to do a lot of other videos. She did a video on Planned Parenthood and statutory
[02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:29.680]  rape. That got on CBS News. So the interesting thing about what we do as citizen journalists
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:33.700]  is that we force this stuff into the mainstream media.
[02:18:33.700 --> 02:18:38.300]  And I think that more people need to do that. Being around these people infiltrating them,
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:42.620]  I've discovered they're almost all really sick people and criminals are a mix of the
[02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:49.460]  two. In all your investigations, I mean, I found it's not like again, it's not like it's
[02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:54.700]  hard to find this. This is a really group of vicious people. And do you agree that the
[02:18:54.700 --> 02:19:00.500]  biggest hoax ever is that the liberal establishment is liberal? They're not. They're a bunch of
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.100]  monsters.
[02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:09.340]  I found it, the word that I use, and a lot of people think that it's absurd. I think
[02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:15.740]  it's fascism. In my experience as a citizen journalist, I have been arrested. I have been
[02:19:15.740 --> 02:19:22.660]  falsely accused. I did a voter fraud expose last year on Eric Holder and a number of states
[02:19:22.660 --> 02:19:28.940]  giving out voting ballots in the name of other people. And these are facts, ideal in fact
[02:19:28.940 --> 02:19:35.140]  as a journalist. And exposing this stuff on videotape, the reaction is always arrest O'Keeffe,
[02:19:35.140 --> 02:19:41.580]  prosecute O'Keeffe, silence O'Keeffe, censor him, silence him, arrest him. And that to
[02:19:41.580 --> 02:19:48.780]  me is not a liberal mentality. There's nothing liberal about wanting to jail journalists.
[02:19:48.780 --> 02:19:52.740]  And this is not, this is just, I'm being straightforward. I was arrested in New Orleans.
[02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:56.660]  Let's talk about that. We're going to break riveting a live interview with James O'Keeffe
[02:19:56.660 --> 02:19:58.660]  from theprojectveritas.org.
[02:19:58.660 --> 02:20:05.820]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:11.600]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested
[02:20:11.600 --> 02:20:15.880]  that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could

[02:20:21.340 --> 02:20:25.780]  the world to keep people healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in

[02:22:00.300 --> 02:22:04.260]  Do you know how much the dollar has lost in its value against other currencies in the
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:09.540]  last 90 days? Ever think about how inflation will change your life, your savings, your
[02:22:09.540 --> 02:22:15.180]  retirement plans? Remember inflation in Zimbabwe, Argentina, the Weimar Republic? Put another
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:21.180]  way, who cares if your investments go up 10% but you lose 40% of your purchasing power?
[02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:25.860]  Gold is the only monetary asset as no one else's liability. Gold still buys the same
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:30.800]  amount of stuff it always did. Gold does not require trust in a third party. You can possess
[02:22:30.800 --> 02:22:35.820]  it in your hand. You can take it with you. Gold is real money. Gold is honest money.
[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:40.260]  My name is Daniel Larson from Midas Resources. To find out how you can protect your savings
[02:22:40.260 --> 02:22:47.460]  and roll over your IRA funds into precious metals accounts, please call me at 800-686-2237

[02:22:59.780 --> 02:23:04.700]  It's time for a home security quiz. Answer this. What effective home security device
[02:23:04.700 --> 02:23:09.020]  is smaller than a coffee cup fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house
[02:23:09.020 --> 02:23:13.820]  while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:20.960]  and sells for less than $35? Yes, it's fake TV. This year about one in every 50 US homes
[02:23:20.960 --> 02:23:25.820]  will have a break in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that
[02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:30.820]  looks like no one is home. Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look
[02:23:30.820 --> 02:23:36.220]  like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV. It's like a lamp
[02:23:36.220 --> 02:23:41.820]  on a timer, but far more convincing. And for only $34.95, fake TV could be the difference
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:47.380]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked. Go to faketv.com or
[02:23:47.380 --> 02:24:14.460]  call 1-877-5FAKETV. That's 877-532-5388 or go to faketv.com. Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[02:24:14.460 --> 02:24:20.540]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you're listening to this for the first time and you think this
[02:24:20.540 --> 02:24:27.300]  is hyperbole, there are scores of clips on their website of acorn people saying, yeah,
[02:24:27.300 --> 02:24:30.340]  we'll help you do this illegal thing. We'll help you run child prostitutes. We'll help
[02:24:30.340 --> 02:24:35.820]  you do that. And this is just how the system works. And they want to make every city like
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:41.500]  the big Chicago, New York mafia style systems. And we need to have the people in Chicago
[02:24:41.500 --> 02:24:44.520]  and New York and other cities stand up against this.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:53.140]  And the way to do it, if you were to follow a Planned Parenthood person, let's say you
[02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:58.500]  work next door to a bar and walk over and record them. Make sure it's a state where
[02:24:58.500 --> 02:25:01.260]  you have one party consent saying, hey, we need to kill the black people. Why do you
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:04.920]  work there? They're gonna agree to you. They've all been told don't talk about it on the phone
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:06.660]  when you call.
[02:25:06.660 --> 02:25:10.660]  And how it's a great civil right and all this stuff. The point is, these people, all of
[02:25:10.660 --> 02:25:15.420]  them are so sick that if you just engage them, they're all involved in bizarre behavior.
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:18.100]  Going back to our guests, this is a short segment, long segment coming up. We'll play
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:25.220]  some clips during it. James O'Keefe, the head journalist of the Project Truth, Project Veritas,
[02:25:25.220 --> 02:25:26.220]  continue.
[02:25:26.220 --> 02:25:30.120]  You were talking about how they're authoritarians, how they're always wanting you arrested for
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:31.940]  exposing their activities.
[02:25:31.940 --> 02:25:39.420]  Exactly, there have been a number of occasions where I've been subpoenaed. Most famously,
[02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:43.820]  there was a huge story where I was in New Orleans investigating Senator Mary Landrieu,
[02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:47.660]  and she was not answering her constituents' phone calls during the health care debate
[02:25:47.660 --> 02:25:53.660]  in 2010. I went into the federal building with a camera, a recording device, and as
[02:25:53.660 --> 02:25:59.180]  you pointed out, one party consent states, so it's legal to do it in Louisiana. But I
[02:25:59.180 --> 02:26:03.700]  was in a federal building, I was arrested, and they were gonna let me go as a journalist.
[02:26:03.700 --> 02:26:08.860]  They said, oh, you're just there to ask questions. And then they found out that I was the acorn
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:14.220]  pimp. I went into acorn posing as a pimp and hooker, and they said, well, you know, based
[02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:19.220]  on the senator and these other situations, we're gonna have to keep you overnight in
[02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:25.500]  federal prison. And then I wake up the next day, and I find myself charged with some ridiculous
[02:26:25.500 --> 02:26:30.940]  felony. I had to get a lawyer, spent six months fighting it, finally got it down to a misdemeanor.
[02:26:30.940 --> 02:26:38.020]  The US attorney resigned in disgrace just recently for going online. It's just so corrupt.
[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:42.740]  And I've been, as a citizen journalist, I'm not like David Gregory. I'm not immune from
[02:26:42.740 --> 02:26:50.360]  being prosecuted for committing crimes. But it's just unbelievable what they wanna censor
[02:26:50.360 --> 02:26:57.540]  us and silence us and even jail us for exposing them on tape. And the good news is I'm still
[02:26:57.540 --> 02:27:02.180]  standing, and we haven't given up, and we've got a ton of stories under our belt. We're
[02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:05.220]  developing a track record now.
[02:27:05.220 --> 02:27:09.980]  Talk about some of the other intriguing investigative reports you put out that haven't gone mega
[02:27:09.980 --> 02:27:12.700]  viral that people may not be aware of.
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:18.100]  Sure, after the acorn story, the MTR story was on the front page of all the major newspapers.
[02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:23.300]  But after that, we did a story on Medicaid. Medicaid, entitlement programs in this country.
[02:27:23.300 --> 02:27:29.380]  We went into Medicaid offices in Ohio, Virginia, and Maine. And we said that we were Russian
[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:40.080]  drug dealers. We talked about pimping girls. We talked about importing exotic sports cars
[02:27:40.080 --> 02:27:45.940]  and putting drugs in. And we said, we just want Medicaid, even though we're multimillionaires.
[02:27:45.940 --> 02:27:49.420]  See something, say something, like the Social Security Administration sending hundreds of
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:53.340]  millions to one address in Austin knowing it's a fraud.
[02:27:53.340 --> 02:27:58.700]  But then literally, the police are told to spy on gun owners and we're criminals.
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:28:03.540]  In the case of Medicaid, what the woman actually told us, and this is on YouTube, it's got
[02:28:03.540 --> 02:28:10.100]  100,000 views, is I said, you know, what are we going to call our illicit drug business?
[02:28:10.100 --> 02:28:17.620]  And she said, just say that you're a babysitter. And she was fired. This worker in Medicaid
[02:28:17.620 --> 02:28:22.540]  was fired. And the state of Ohio said they were going to retrain all their workers.
[02:28:22.540 --> 02:28:27.380]  We did it in Virginia. We got the same response. The Medicaid worker told us not to put it
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:32.580]  down on our forms. We did it in Maine. The governor of each state launched an investigation.
[02:28:32.580 --> 02:28:37.180]  There is a criminal culture to liberals. I've got to be honest. Again, I don't like the
[02:28:37.180 --> 02:28:44.260]  Republicans either, but downright local Democrats, when you really get near them, they're crooks.
[02:28:44.260 --> 02:28:50.780]  As evidenced by the videos that we've produced, they certainly don't have a problem with helping
[02:28:50.780 --> 02:28:52.220]  give money, give government-
[02:28:52.220 --> 02:28:57.340]  Telling somebody to falsify forms to cover up drug dealing is a crime.
[02:28:57.340 --> 02:29:03.180]  That's absolutely right. And by the way, the police have gotten involved. They have Cuccinelli
[02:29:03.180 --> 02:29:08.300]  in Virginia. He launched a criminal investigation, a criminal probe, and then most recently with
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:13.460]  our voter fraud video in Virginia. Many people, your listeners may know this story. It was
[02:29:13.460 --> 02:29:20.140]  all over the mainstream media, but Congressman Jim Moran's son resigned in October over telling
[02:29:20.140 --> 02:29:27.020]  one of our undercover reporters how to vote twice to elect President Obama, a forging
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:31.740]  utility bills, voting in the names of other people. So this is a Congressman's son who
[02:29:31.740 --> 02:29:37.180]  was his field director. His name is Patrick Moran. He resigned and the police got involved.
[02:29:37.180 --> 02:29:42.060]  The detective in Arlington County called me, wanted me to cooperate with this investigation.
[02:29:42.060 --> 02:29:46.140]  And then I find out this detective might be bought and sold by the Congressman. So it's
[02:29:46.140 --> 02:29:48.060]  really, it's difficult being a citizen.
[02:29:48.060 --> 02:29:50.380]  We'll be right back. This is amazing.
[02:29:50.380 --> 02:29:57.380]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:01.220 --> 02:30:06.060]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[02:30:06.060 --> 02:30:10.620]  like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[02:30:10.620 --> 02:30:15.580]  by a disastrous economy? Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything. At eFoods

[02:30:24.380 --> 02:30:29.140]  wrote almost all of the grocery stores are closed, but I managed to get my eFoods just
[02:30:29.140 --> 02:30:34.800]  in time to be able to help my sister and niece. It is better to be prepared 10 years too early

[02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:14.720]  globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce
[02:32:14.720 --> 02:32:18.840]  to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness

[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:43.880]  live James O'Keefe of the Project Veritas. Project Truth is on with us. The Project Veritas.org.
[02:33:43.880 --> 02:33:51.720]  Of course, our sites are InfoWars.com and the nightly news is transmitted out via prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:51.720 --> 02:33:57.520]  By the way, one membership for $5.95 a month now is 11 memberships. Your membership and
[02:33:57.520 --> 02:34:02.880]  10 other people simultaneously can use the same username and passcode. So use an original
[02:34:02.880 --> 02:34:06.800]  username passcode that's simple and then give it to friends and family because probably
[02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:09.040]  it's like 20 people.
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:13.080]  There's no way that usually all 11 people are gonna be tuned in at seven o'clock every
[02:34:13.080 --> 02:34:17.800]  night when Info Wars Nightly News goes on. That's part of Operation Awaken the Sleeping
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:24.120]  Giant. We will officially launch the $100,000 film. I've gotten so behind with all the gun
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:30.360]  grabbing all the tyranny we're facing that I have not lost the big $100,000 contest for
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:31.360]  films yet.
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:36.640]  We should have done that like three weeks ago, but we're gonna launch it with a film
[02:34:36.640 --> 02:34:42.920]  promo tomorrow on the show premiered here. I shot the video, wrote the rules, went over
[02:34:42.920 --> 02:34:49.900]  it with legal. It's $115,000 in cash prizes, $100,000 first place. That will be announced
[02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:50.900]  tomorrow on the radio.
[02:34:50.900 --> 02:34:55.080]  I know I said I would announce it a few weeks ago and never got to it because quite frankly,
[02:34:55.080 --> 02:34:58.660]  everything comes secondary to free speech and the Second Amendment. I mean, when that's
[02:34:58.660 --> 02:35:03.660]  getting attacked, you notice I haven't even plugged in products or things until last week.
[02:35:03.660 --> 02:35:08.000]  And a little secret about radio, most of the real funding of the syndicated show itself
[02:35:08.000 --> 02:35:09.680]  is what they do live on air.
[02:35:09.680 --> 02:35:14.680]  You listen to most talk show hosts, it's into the show with a plug, out of the break with
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.440]  a plug, five, six, seven plugs an hour. And quite frankly, I should be doing a couple
[02:35:18.440 --> 02:35:22.880]  hour because that's how I can fund this operation. They're like, hey, there's not a lot of money
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:24.760]  coming in, better plug stuff.
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:30.100]  Plus I plug things I believe in, like the new Infowars.com come and take it shirt with
[02:35:30.100 --> 02:35:36.440]  an AK-47 and inside of it the words, the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[02:35:36.440 --> 02:35:42.200]  And also, two years in the making, designed by scientists engineers in the US, now made
[02:35:42.200 --> 02:35:48.640]  in England with the latest technology. And two years being built and approved and certified,
[02:35:48.640 --> 02:35:53.280]  read all that information side by side, gravity fed filtration system by ProPure.
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:58.800]  It's called ProOne and it is two filters in one. It's got the silver base system impregnated
[02:35:58.800 --> 02:36:06.280]  with silver and ceramic. Under it, the system's to reduce down to 95% hydrofluorosolic acid.
[02:36:06.280 --> 02:36:12.200]  The big secret is the other leading filters, and we've sold these with ProPure cuz it's
[02:36:12.200 --> 02:36:17.280]  good to get most of it out. Only get around half of it out because the hydrofluorosolic
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:18.720]  acid goes right through it.
[02:36:18.720 --> 02:36:23.960]  This 95%, okay, this is amazing. In fact, the other filters don't even really do anything
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:28.200]  to hydrofluoric acid, but it tends to break back down. The point is it loses electron
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:32.520]  or they pull an electron and then add it. All the science stuff's up on the site. This
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:37.040]  is a revolution. We are the biggest distributor of ProPure because I did my own research two
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:38.320]  years ago and got them as a sponsor.
[02:36:38.320 --> 02:36:42.520]  You notice for a year I didn't have a gravity fed sponsor because the quality unfortunately
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:45.120]  with some of them out there just wasn't even good enough for me to promote it. You hear
[02:36:45.120 --> 02:36:49.880]  ads on the network where I've already been approached and offered $500,000 in a year
[02:36:49.880 --> 02:36:55.280]  to promote this. I go, no, I'm not gonna promote it. I don't believe in it. If I believe in
[02:36:55.280 --> 02:36:57.140]  something, you're gonna hear me promoting it.
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:37:06.880]  And this is an amazing system, ProPure, infowarstore.com, infowarstore.com, or 888-253-3139. And it's
[02:37:06.880 --> 02:37:14.480]  10% off on all the stainless steel systems, the Traveler, the Big, the King, all of it.
[02:37:14.480 --> 02:37:20.620]  And 10% off even the new filters that are launching today. Today, today, today, made
[02:37:20.620 --> 02:37:25.920]  in England. Not even factories that can make this in the United States or places like China
[02:37:25.920 --> 02:37:29.480]  or India. You can see right there on the filter it says made in England.
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:33.560]  So there you go. All right, enough of me ranting and raving about that. It's just that your
[02:37:33.560 --> 02:37:42.800]  purchase makes the transmission possible. So infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139. Films
[02:37:42.800 --> 02:37:48.000]  like Strategic Relocation and others that I produced also available at infowarstore.com.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.360]  Or to understand the eugenics angle, infowarstore.com with end game blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:38:00.640]  I wanna go to this pimp clip in a moment. But continuing here with our guest James O'Keeffe
[02:38:00.640 --> 02:38:06.800]  of the Project Veritas. What else do you wanna impart to viewers and listeners about the
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:08.120]  state of the world right now?
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:12.080]  I mean, I think the biggest thing I would ask you is, what is your rallying cry? Because
[02:38:12.080 --> 02:38:17.320]  your rallying cry just from truth is what mine is. Evil men and tyrants flourish because
[02:38:17.320 --> 02:38:21.080]  good men and women do nothing. These people, a lot of these people that run the system
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:26.400]  are really stupid. But it's our weakness in bowing down to government that empowers them.
[02:38:26.400 --> 02:38:31.960]  It's the ether in which these slugs thrive. You've got the floor, my friend.
[02:38:31.960 --> 02:38:40.160]  Well, one thing that's unique about Project Veritas is that I don't advocate policy solutions.
[02:38:40.160 --> 02:38:47.120]  I don't tell people who to vote for. I don't tell people what to believe. I'm a strong
[02:38:47.120 --> 02:38:52.600]  believer in the following statement. I believe in the, I have an infinite faith in the power
[02:38:52.600 --> 02:38:57.120]  of free people. That if they're just making their own decisions, if they have the truth
[02:38:57.120 --> 02:39:01.640]  available to them, that they will make the best decisions to create a great, lasting
[02:39:01.640 --> 02:39:07.280]  and moral society. I think what we need more of, we need more journalism. We need more
[02:39:07.280 --> 02:39:13.840]  people exposing the facts. And the fact of the matter is that there aren't a lot of journalists.
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:18.240]  There are a lot of stenographers, people who, you know, they write down what the politicians
[02:39:18.240 --> 02:39:25.520]  say at the podium, or pundits, people who are, you know, on television, or they take
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:29.800]  preexisting content. But Alex, one thing I actually admired, you did, I must have seen
[02:39:29.800 --> 02:39:37.000]  this video maybe eight years ago, but on YouTube, you went into the DMV, and they asked you
[02:39:37.000 --> 02:39:42.120]  for identification. You took out eight pieces of identification. What you were doing is
[02:39:42.120 --> 02:39:46.120]  important. I mean, that's a direct action. You went in there and you sort of, you taped
[02:39:46.120 --> 02:39:52.440]  it, you exposed something. We need more people doing journalism, pure journalism. And I think
[02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:57.760]  that people are smart enough. This recent video we did on the guns in New York and the
[02:39:57.760 --> 02:40:02.920]  people pushing gun owners, I went up to the journalists and I asked them, would you put
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:06.960]  a sign on your lawn that says that your home is gun free?
[02:40:06.960 --> 02:40:10.080]  By the way, let me stop you there. That's the original reason I wanted to get you on
[02:40:10.080 --> 02:40:15.600]  last week. Start over, and the video is on your website, it's amazing. We can probably
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:19.440]  play some here for viewers while he's talking, then I have the pimp clip. But I mean, this
[02:40:19.440 --> 02:40:23.640]  shows their incredible hypocrisy. The truth is they've got guns, they've got bodyguards.
[02:40:23.640 --> 02:40:27.760]  Their kids go to schools with armed men like David Gregory. So start over and tell people
[02:40:27.760 --> 02:40:28.760]  about that.
[02:40:28.760 --> 02:40:33.200]  Sure, I was inspired to do this because of David Gregory and because I have been arrested
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:39.720]  and falsely accused and faced political prosecution. And the judge destroyed my videotape so that
[02:40:39.720 --> 02:40:44.800]  no one knows what I actually did in Louisiana. But when David Gregory on NBC News brought
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:50.920]  a magazine into the studio, which is a felony in Washington DC, and he was not prosecuted.
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:55.560]  In fact, the DC Attorney General released a statement, I believe it was two weeks ago,
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:01.400]  and the district, I actually have it in front of me here, he said that it was a clear violation
[02:41:01.400 --> 02:41:06.760]  of the law, what Gregory did. But it didn't, quote, serve the best interests of the people,
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.600]  unquote, to prosecute David Gregory. Now, he does have prosecutorial discretion-
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:16.160]  So he's Judge Dredd now. They tell juries we can't judge the law and the facts, which
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:20.760]  of course we can. But the police, especially high level ones, they're not supposed to do
[02:41:20.760 --> 02:41:26.640]  that. It's a grand jury and it's the people. Well, that is, I know I've done a lot of constitutional
[02:41:26.640 --> 02:41:30.920]  law research. What that prosecutor did, I think was wrong.
[02:41:30.920 --> 02:41:35.040]  I think it's wrong because I think the Supreme Court says equal justice under law. And if
[02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:39.840]  I did that, if I, for purposes of a YouTube video, if I brought a magazine in the District
[02:41:39.840 --> 02:41:43.520]  of Columbia from an AR-15, I'd be prosecuted, no question.
[02:41:43.520 --> 02:41:47.560]  If I did, I'd be arrested, you know it. There is a different, so I'm just getting
[02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:51.840]  to what inspired me to do this video, which I think is important, is the fact that there's
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:57.160]  a different class of people, the politicians, the journalists, they consider themselves
[02:41:57.160 --> 02:42:03.000]  protected from the law. And then I got to thinking, now, what if I made them live up
[02:42:03.000 --> 02:42:08.080]  to their own principles, and I went to the, okay, you obviously don't like guns.
[02:42:08.080 --> 02:42:13.160]  So will you advertise that to the public? Will you put a sign on your lawn that says
[02:42:13.160 --> 02:42:19.480]  this house is proudly gun free? Because journalists, you're willing to advertise to the world who
[02:42:19.480 --> 02:42:24.160]  owns a gun, you're willing to publish law abiding gun owners, therefore you should have
[02:42:24.160 --> 02:42:27.800]  no problem with doing it. They're terrorists, they're not journalists,
[02:42:27.800 --> 02:42:31.760]  they're saying the South is all scum, gun owners are scum, publishing where we live
[02:42:31.760 --> 02:42:36.720]  that we have guns. It's time to get angry at these people. I mean, that newspaper needs
[02:42:36.720 --> 02:42:41.160]  to be sued. We need to get aggressive with them. I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:42:41.160 --> 02:42:47.400]  No, I mean, my way of doing that is by exposing them. I think that we need to, I went to their
[02:42:47.400 --> 02:42:52.280]  homes. I mean, there's nothing more aggressive than going to somebody's house and knocking
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:56.120]  on the door. And I went to their homes with a camera. They didn't know they were being
[02:42:56.120 --> 02:43:00.960]  taped. And I said, you know, I said that to the publisher of the Westchester Journal News,
[02:43:00.960 --> 02:43:05.520]  that's the newspaper that printed all the gun owners in Westchester County. I live in
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.400]  Westchester, New York. That's where I'm from. I'm only a few miles away from these people.
[02:43:09.400 --> 02:43:16.360]  And we said, would you post the sign on the lawn? Nobody would post the sign. In fact,
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:20.440]  if you watch the video, the most extraordinary thing about this YouTube video is that all
[02:43:20.440 --> 02:43:27.640]  these editors and reporters are justifying the Second Amendment. They're pro gun. They
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:32.040]  just don't know it. Instinctively, their human nature informs them that they don't want to
[02:43:32.040 --> 02:43:36.960]  tell people they're gun free. And that's what I'm trying to tell you. My message at Project
[02:43:36.960 --> 02:43:41.880]  Veritas is that I have faith in free people if they're just given the facts that they
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:43.640]  know what's good for them and their families.
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:48.400]  Well, I'll say this. They're trying to physically make us turn our guns in, register them, ban
[02:43:48.400 --> 02:43:54.520]  them. They're assaulting us. And our founders, you know, physically went after them. We need
[02:43:54.520 --> 02:43:59.840]  to just go and get in their faces at public events. If they're publishing people's names
[02:43:59.840 --> 02:44:04.400]  and where they live, we need to go to their house and say, hey, I'm out here with a bullhorn,
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:05.400]  buddy.
[02:44:05.400 --> 02:44:10.120]  Anybody who got your name published in the newspaper, they assaulted your privacy. They
[02:44:10.120 --> 02:44:16.760]  told criminals who to go rob. It's time to go to their houses and bullhorn them and to
[02:44:16.760 --> 02:44:20.640]  come back the next day and bullhorn them. When the cops show up videotape it and go,
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:23.280]  officer, here's my name in the newspaper where I live and I have a gun.
[02:44:23.280 --> 02:44:27.160]  I have a first right to be here and do this. And then if they arrest you, you sue them
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:33.880]  because of the hypocrisy. I mean, it's time to get aggressive. Here's an example. 1996.
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:39.040]  They are taking veterans' homes, $2,000 a day fines. They had some registry at the hospital,
[02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:42.960]  I discovered. I learned this from hospital workers that they would know when somebody
[02:44:42.960 --> 02:44:46.440]  had bad cancer or had a heart attack and was a widow, a widower.
[02:44:46.440 --> 02:44:50.640]  They would then go to the nice home in the million dollar area that they wanted to get
[02:44:50.640 --> 02:44:56.320]  and force into foreclosure. They put $2,000 a day fines on it for three inch grass. Well,
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:59.560]  a good cop called me and said, hey, I know where all the city council people live. A
[02:44:59.560 --> 02:45:02.160]  bunch of them have like three foot grass, the middle of the city, holes in the roofs.
[02:45:02.160 --> 02:45:07.040]  I don't know why they did. So I went to Jackie Goodman's house and others, went to the health
[02:45:07.040 --> 02:45:08.520]  department.
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:13.560]  Showed they had like foot tall grass and trash on the ground and said, okay, let's put $2,000
[02:45:13.560 --> 02:45:17.960]  fines on you. And they dropped all these fines on old people. Here's the problem. My phone,
[02:45:17.960 --> 02:45:22.840]  I was one guy, two guys, ringing with old people having their houses taken for two inch
[02:45:22.840 --> 02:45:23.840]  grass.
[02:45:23.840 --> 02:45:26.440]  And they always were like, let me ask, you should have a heart attack. You can't walk.
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:30.560]  Yeah, you just got out of the hospital last week and the notices are coming. Let me guess,
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:34.040]  you got, so you're dying of cancer. Yeah, I got a few months to live. They just want
[02:45:34.040 --> 02:45:38.600]  your house. They want to lean on it. I mean, that's a mafia right there. And you know what,
[02:45:38.600 --> 02:45:41.200]  I couldn't, I bet it's still going on.
[02:45:41.200 --> 02:45:47.120]  That's the frustration. We need 50 Alex Jones's in Austin. We need 50 in Rochester, New York.
[02:45:47.120 --> 02:45:53.880]  We need 100 in Chicago. I mean, people are being abused, folks. And folks go in and turn
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:57.480]  their TVs on and watch sitcoms at night. And they don't know the old lady's having their
[02:45:57.480 --> 02:45:59.120]  house stolen.
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:00.720]  Go ahead, I'm ranting.
[02:46:00.720 --> 02:46:07.320]  No, I would respect if these journalists, for example, would put the signs on their
[02:46:07.320 --> 02:46:12.600]  lawns. I would at least respect that because they would be philosophically consistent.
[02:46:12.600 --> 02:46:17.560]  But the fact that they're inconsistent, the fact that they would be willing to publish
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:23.760]  gun owners but be unwilling to advertise themselves as not owning guns. We went to MSNBC's Toure.
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:29.720]  Toure is a commentator on MSNBC. And he was unwilling to post the sign. He was stumbling
[02:46:29.720 --> 02:46:34.080]  and stuttering when we asked him to. He said, you know what, I don't know if I want to do
[02:46:34.080 --> 02:46:35.080]  that.
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:41.400]  And that's what makes them frauds and cowards. And nobody, nobody likes a fraud or a coward.
[02:46:41.400 --> 02:46:47.800]  And nobody rides for free either. I'm sick of these slugs feeding off of us.
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:52.080]  And what we tried to do, we want to measure the courage of their convictions. Do they
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:55.760]  actually believe in this thing? And at the end of the video, one of the most telling,
[02:46:55.760 --> 02:46:59.960]  I think this is the most fascinating thing about the video, is that one of the reporters
[02:46:59.960 --> 02:47:05.000]  for the New Jersey Star-Ledger, who supported outing gun owners and printing their names
[02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:10.120]  and addresses, told us that he hates guns, he wishes they were banned and everything.
[02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:16.680]  But if, this is his words, he says, when the right wing takes over the government, we need
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:22.080]  to be armed to defend ourselves from that government. So even though he's putting an
[02:47:22.080 --> 02:47:26.840]  ideological spin on it, he's actually making some type of justification for the Second
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:27.840]  Amendment.
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:30.640]  But they're so dumb, they don't get that right wing, left wings control at the top, there's
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:34.400]  gonna be Republicans in later. No, liberals, I all knew, went out and bought guns under
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:37.940]  Bush. And now they're like, let's turn them in.
[02:47:37.940 --> 02:47:42.720]  It's just mindlessness. These people have no sense. And you know what, I wanna hold
[02:47:42.720 --> 02:47:45.640]  you if you can do it a little bit in the next hour and go into overdrive, cuz I promised
[02:47:45.640 --> 02:47:49.160]  to go to phone calls. And I wanna play some of these reports of you going and doing the
[02:47:49.160 --> 02:47:51.480]  guns. Can you do 30 minutes more into the next hour?
[02:47:51.480 --> 02:47:56.080]  Sure, yep, absolutely. Okay, fantastic. I wanna play now, though, the pimp clip. Do
[02:47:56.080 --> 02:48:01.880]  we have that queued up? Yep, cuz we're gonna go to the pimp clip first. Because this is
[02:48:01.880 --> 02:48:06.320]  what you're more, I mean, this is super mega viral for months, brought down Acorn, got
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:09.080]  it defunded. How many billions did it get defunded?
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:15.240]  It was allocated $5 billion in the stimulus package. And of course, they went bankrupt
[02:48:15.240 --> 02:48:18.520]  after the videos, so they weren't given any of that.
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:21.920]  Tell people a little bit more about that case, if they may have forgotten.
[02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:27.980]  Sure, Acorn Association of Community Organized for Reform Now. President Barack Obama was
[02:48:27.980 --> 02:48:35.480]  an attorney for Acorn, I believe in the 80s or 90s. Acorn, it has a couple different branches,
[02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:41.720]  but they claim to help giving low income housing for people. What they mostly do is they get
[02:48:41.720 --> 02:48:45.720]  out the vote efforts, they help with voter registration drives.
[02:48:45.720 --> 02:48:51.860]  What we wanted to uncover was, what exactly this group is doing, where its money goes.
[02:48:51.860 --> 02:48:58.720]  We visited Acorn branches across the United States, and I posed as a pimp. Of course,
[02:48:58.720 --> 02:49:02.680]  I'm not the most pimp-like individual, but I-
[02:49:02.680 --> 02:49:05.960]  No, welfare and all this, cuz I've talked to people involved, it's all designed for
[02:49:05.960 --> 02:49:10.400]  fraud. You can go in and get 20 kids signed up. You can go in and they want control and
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:13.320]  they want to bankrupt the country. Let's go to this clip where you're saying, this is
[02:49:13.320 --> 02:49:16.880]  my underage girl I brought in from another country, I want to bring in more.
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:20.480]  They're like, hey, we'll help you falsify everything, just make sure she's in school.
[02:49:20.480 --> 02:49:21.480]  Here it is.
[02:49:21.480 --> 02:49:22.480]  Cops on us before.
[02:49:22.480 --> 02:49:27.160]  Right, and anything that's in Maryland, anything that's not governing the food, it's always
[02:49:27.160 --> 02:49:30.400]  against the law. That's rule number one.
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:33.280]  Do you default to taxes?
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:34.280]  No.
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:37.360]  Well, she gets paid mostly in cash, which makes a lot of money, though, so you could
[02:49:37.360 --> 02:49:38.360]  afford something.
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:41.760]  Okay, let me get somebody here for taxes so they can talk to you about how do you do this.
[02:49:41.760 --> 02:49:42.760]  It's not like that.
[02:49:42.760 --> 02:49:46.000]  It's against the law, and law enforcement is very prejudicial towards us.
[02:49:46.000 --> 02:49:49.960]  But she's going to make us illegal books of this. That's like, yes, I got the taxes.
[02:49:49.960 --> 02:49:50.960]  How can she do that, though?
[02:49:50.960 --> 02:49:58.800]  Because she is good. I'm going to tell you, she won't know how you can make it legal.
[02:49:58.800 --> 02:50:03.760]  She's really good. She's not going to get drunk on herself.
[02:50:03.760 --> 02:50:07.840]  The type of business or service she provides, let me make sure there's a code for it, okay?
[02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:09.240]  A code for prostitution?
[02:50:09.240 --> 02:50:14.040]  Well, yeah, because I have to have a name and a code number.
[02:50:14.040 --> 02:50:16.240]  Well, I don't know if there's going to be a code for it.
[02:50:16.240 --> 02:50:18.240]  But I'm going to look in there, I'm going to get my list.
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:19.240]  Okay.
[02:50:19.240 --> 02:50:21.440]  She's going to sit up and say she's good, that's what I'm saying.
[02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:23.720]  She's going to make us illegal books of this.
[02:50:23.720 --> 02:50:24.720]  Well, how can she do that?
[02:50:24.720 --> 02:50:26.720]  Let me make sure there's a code for it, okay?
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:27.720]  A code for prostitution?
[02:50:27.720 --> 02:50:28.720]  Okay, let's see what we got here.
[02:50:28.720 --> 02:50:29.720]  Combination, food service, and drinking places.
[02:50:29.720 --> 02:50:30.720]  Business and food department.
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:31.720]  Service out of the collection agencies.
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:32.720]  Credit bills.
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:33.720]  You might have to name it something else.
[02:50:33.720 --> 02:50:47.640]  I mean, there's hours of this stuff, and then they get into the underage people they're
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:48.640]  going to bring in.
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:49.640]  That's all great.
[02:50:49.640 --> 02:50:50.640]  We're going to go to break.
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:51.640]  Come back with our guests.
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:52.640]  Go to some of your calls that have been holding.
[02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:57.480]  Jerome in Illinois, Truth Raider in Oregon, and others, and we're going to go into overdrive
[02:50:57.480 --> 02:50:58.480]  with our guests.
[02:50:58.480 --> 02:51:01.240]  With more, straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:51:01.240 --> 02:51:04.980]  If you've ever wanted one of our best-selling generators, but were waiting for an offer
[02:51:04.980 --> 02:51:10.000]  so crazy you couldn't refuse, then you're not going to want to miss this exciting message.
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:11.000]  Here's why.
[02:51:11.000 --> 02:51:16.260]  Our solar generators provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators, solar generators
[02:51:16.260 --> 02:51:20.660]  run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:51:20.660 --> 02:51:24.080]  So when the lights go out, you'll always have the power you need.
[02:51:24.080 --> 02:51:25.720]  Now here's the best part.
[02:51:25.720 --> 02:51:30.420]  Every year we accumulate a few solar generators that we just can't sell as new.
[02:51:30.420 --> 02:51:35.600]  We put them in a special spot in our warehouse, and we discount them heavily at the end of
[02:51:35.600 --> 02:51:36.600]  each year.
[02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:40.320]  We call them scratch and dent units, but they're really just like new.
[02:51:40.320 --> 02:51:45.520]  Each unit comes with a full factory warranty and special bonuses you just won't believe.
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:46.520]  Don't wait.
[02:51:46.520 --> 02:51:47.520]  They go fast.
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:48.680]  Go to scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:51:48.680 --> 02:51:50.960]  That's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:51:50.960 --> 02:51:55.800]  For the craziest offer we've ever made, go to scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:51:55.800 --> 02:52:25.280]  That's scratchanddentsolar.com.
[02:52:25.280 --> 02:52:29.240]  Other than decomposition, the Bokashi system uses fermentation to break down waste, so
[02:52:29.240 --> 02:52:33.520]  it takes less time to create nutrient-dense humus for crops or gardens with no turning
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:35.200]  and no obnoxious odors.

[02:52:49.200 --> 02:52:52.720]  That's 866-369-3678.
[02:52:52.720 --> 02:52:56.320]  Call all your food wastes in about six weeks with the Bokashi food waste recycling system
[02:52:56.320 --> 02:52:57.320]  from tereganics.com.
[02:52:57.320 --> 02:52:58.320]  Tereganics.
[02:52:58.320 --> 02:52:59.320]  Life's getting better.
[02:52:59.320 --> 02:53:00.320]  Hi there.
[02:53:00.320 --> 02:53:01.320]  My name is Frank Bates.
[02:53:01.320 --> 02:53:06.760]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble.
[02:53:06.760 --> 02:53:13.000]  I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity
[02:53:13.000 --> 02:53:17.760]  monopolies and government agencies for what they really are, incompetent line crooks that
[02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:22.600]  are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high.
[02:53:22.600 --> 02:53:26.880]  Some have called this a conspiracy, others have called it a cover-up, and you will be
[02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:30.760]  shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.
[02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:36.400]  My video at 123coverup.com exposes the truth and shows you the secret of how I beat them
[02:53:36.400 --> 02:53:38.840]  and how you can beat them too.
[02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:42.600]  Watch the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[02:53:42.600 --> 02:53:43.760]  in the last three months.
[02:53:43.760 --> 02:53:49.680]  Go to 123coverup.com and discover one weird trick to slash your power bill and protect
[02:53:49.680 --> 02:53:50.680]  your home.
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:56.560]  Go watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down.
[02:53:56.560 --> 02:53:58.560]  Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[02:53:58.560 --> 02:53:59.560]  All right.
[02:53:59.560 --> 02:54:20.640]  In this segment, the next, we're going to take some calls with folks that have been
[02:54:20.640 --> 02:54:22.360]  holding on the Second Amendment with James O'Keefe.
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:26.840]  Then we'll do 30 minutes with him in overdrive, which a lot of stations carry, into the fourth
[02:54:26.840 --> 02:54:27.840]  hour.
[02:54:27.840 --> 02:54:28.840]  We always do three hours.
[02:54:28.840 --> 02:54:31.880]  For a while, I did four hours, so we still keep doing the fourth hour sometimes because
[02:54:31.880 --> 02:54:35.280]  there's a bunch of other news I want to cover after he leaves us as well.
[02:54:35.280 --> 02:54:36.280]  But it's official.
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:39.640]  They're coming after the handguns too, and we're going to play some of the clips for
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:45.240]  radio listeners and TV listeners of James O'Keefe going to Eric Holder's house and saying,
[02:54:45.240 --> 02:54:47.120]  will you put up a gun-free zone sign?
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:50.160]  I mean, Eric Holder is a gangster, folks.
[02:54:50.160 --> 02:54:55.800]  I mean, hardcore, Fast and Furious, OKC, involved in it all.
[02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:00.040]  And this guy's got gigantic huevos rancheros.
[02:55:00.040 --> 02:55:02.000]  James O'Keefe is our guest.
[02:55:02.000 --> 02:55:04.520]  Folks have been holding Jerome, Truther, and others.
[02:55:04.520 --> 02:55:08.560]  Jerome in Illinois, thanks for holding here on the air about the Second Amendment, I believe
[02:55:08.560 --> 02:55:09.560]  you called him.
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:10.560]  Go ahead.
[02:55:10.560 --> 02:55:11.560]  Yeah.
[02:55:11.560 --> 02:55:16.620]  Thanks for having me on your show, Alex, and it's good to hear that there's other people
[02:55:16.620 --> 02:55:21.120]  in the world that share my thoughts about gun control.
[02:55:21.120 --> 02:55:25.520]  You know, I keep hearing people ask the question about assault weapons.
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:28.560]  Do Americans really need an assault weapon to defend themselves?
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:32.600]  And my answer to that question is absolutely yes.
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:36.120]  I believe we do need assault weapons because it levels the playing field.
[02:55:36.120 --> 02:55:40.360]  That's right, the criminals are going to have them, so we need them.
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:43.560]  But I mean, they use that debate.
[02:55:43.560 --> 02:55:45.040]  It's about enslavement.
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:46.320]  Let's ask our guest.
[02:55:46.320 --> 02:55:48.000]  Why do you think they're coming after the guns?
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:51.400]  I mean, I think I know the answer I'm going to get.
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:55.640]  Oh, you're asking me why do I think they're coming after like AR-15s and things like that?
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:55:57.520]  It's because they love you, right?
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:58.800]  They want to help you.
[02:55:58.800 --> 02:56:03.960]  I mean, I think they're coming after them in order to...
[02:56:03.960 --> 02:56:12.000]  I think that they may have good intentions, but they're emotional and they don't understand
[02:56:12.000 --> 02:56:17.400]  that when you take away law-abiding gun owners that you, you know, you increase crimes.
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:18.400]  Come on!
[02:56:18.400 --> 02:56:23.280]  Diane Feinstein is a crime boss, insider, I mean, come on.
[02:56:23.280 --> 02:56:24.280]  You're a smart guy.
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:25.280]  You're not that naive.
[02:56:25.280 --> 02:56:28.080]  You know the criminal elements the government want our guns to enslave us.
[02:56:28.080 --> 02:56:31.040]  They even admit that in some of their white papers.
[02:56:31.040 --> 02:56:33.240]  Sometimes they do admit it, and you're right.
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:35.080]  Other times, sometimes they're well-intentioned.
[02:56:35.080 --> 02:56:38.560]  They just don't realize the policy outcome of when they do that, when they ban law-abiding
[02:56:38.560 --> 02:56:39.560]  people from owning guns.
[02:56:39.560 --> 02:56:44.960]  Well, yeah, I mean, some of the little chicken necks and stuff that, you know, didn't have
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:46.480]  somebody take them out shooting and things.
[02:56:46.480 --> 02:56:47.480]  They're scared of them, I agree.
[02:56:47.480 --> 02:56:49.400]  I'm talking about high level.
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:53.840]  Why does the, why does the UN want guns worldwide?
[02:56:53.840 --> 02:56:54.840]  That's beyond my pay grade.
[02:56:54.840 --> 02:56:56.880]  They want to be the only ones with guns.
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:56:57.880]  That's their plan.
[02:56:57.880 --> 02:57:00.480]  That's, yes, that's, that's very true.
[02:57:00.480 --> 02:57:03.080]  I mean, you know about the UN worldwide, what they do?
[02:57:03.080 --> 02:57:07.160]  I mean, they line people up in Africa and Latin America and just shoot villages to take
[02:57:07.160 --> 02:57:08.560]  their property on record.
[02:57:08.560 --> 02:57:13.640]  They killed 4,000 people in Burma on record in the 90s, just went in and killed all the
[02:57:13.640 --> 02:57:15.280]  villagers to take their property.
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:19.800]  The UN is a giant murder crew, but they constantly have every Miss America saying, oh, they're
[02:57:19.800 --> 02:57:20.800]  so sweet.
[02:57:20.800 --> 02:57:22.120]  They're helping the children.
[02:57:22.120 --> 02:57:25.760]  They go in and start the wars, but they're the UN, so it must be okay.
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:29.260]  One of the interesting things that I've found in my research, one thing that we're working
[02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:33.760]  on right now is the sort of, just like with Planned Parenthood and the racist elements
[02:57:33.760 --> 02:57:39.040]  with that, some of the racist elements with gun control.
[02:57:39.040 --> 02:57:43.120]  Clarence Thomas wrote a concurring opinion on McDonald v. Chicago, and he goes into the
[02:57:43.120 --> 02:57:49.640]  Ku Klux Klan and disarming African American people and what that means in the inner city
[02:57:49.640 --> 02:57:50.640]  communities.
[02:57:50.640 --> 02:57:54.680]  And there are some people who are practitioners in the Heller case in DC.
[02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:55.920]  That's a very interesting angle.
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:00.080]  No, exactly, and that's why they call guns racist, which makes no sense, is to flip it
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:04.400]  because you notice it's the black areas where they always have the gun control so that only
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:07.300]  the criminals have the guns and the crime rates explode.
[02:58:07.300 --> 02:58:10.240]  They know it's gonna make it a crime pit.
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:15.720]  And also, a lot of black people are dying because they don't have the ability to defend
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:16.720]  themselves.
[02:58:16.720 --> 02:58:18.040]  Jerome, anything else from Illinois?
[02:58:18.040 --> 02:58:20.800]  Yeah, one other comment.
[02:58:20.800 --> 02:58:25.780]  I also wanted to say that I heard Alan Dershowitz say on Pierce Morgan's show that he would
[02:58:25.780 --> 02:58:29.760]  be afraid to go into your home and have a disagreement with you because he would feel
[02:58:29.760 --> 02:58:33.920]  uncomfortable thinking that you might go for one of your guns.
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:39.240]  And I would like to ask Alan Dershowitz how comfortable would he feel if he had a disagreement
[02:58:39.240 --> 02:58:40.240]  with it?
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:41.240]  Stay there.
[02:58:41.240 --> 02:58:46.240]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:55.840 --> 03:00:05.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.800 --> 03:00:10.640]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[03:00:10.640 --> 03:00:11.640]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.640 --> 03:00:13.760]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.760 --> 03:00:17.960]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:17.960 --> 03:00:22.680]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.680 --> 03:00:31.160]  All right, we're into the fourth hour of overdrive here on this Thursday edition, and we're joined
[03:00:31.160 --> 03:00:32.160]  by James O'Keefe.
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:36.040]  I get so relaxed by the fourth hour, I stop even pronunciating.
[03:00:36.040 --> 03:00:37.440]  It's not like I'm drunk.
[03:00:37.440 --> 03:00:40.720]  I've been on radio so much and TV so much the last 17 years.
[03:00:40.720 --> 03:00:42.760]  Probably more airtime than anybody else out there.
[03:00:42.760 --> 03:00:47.760]  I just kind of get like, man, yeah, next guest up, let's go to, I'm like, oh, wait, I'm on
[03:00:47.760 --> 03:00:48.760]  the radio.
[03:00:48.760 --> 03:00:50.320]  Let me actually pronunciate my words.
[03:00:50.320 --> 03:00:55.600]  James O'Keefe, and he heads up the Project Veritas, and we're very excited to have him
[03:00:55.600 --> 03:00:57.240]  on with us in another 30 minutes.
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:01:00.880]  We're gonna start taking more of your calls, and then after we're done taking a few calls,
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:05.120]  we're gonna get into some of the other things they're working on right now and play some
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:08.840]  more of the videos of him going to Eric Holder's house to say, hey, why don't you put a sign
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:10.200]  up saying you don't own guns?
[03:01:10.200 --> 03:01:12.480]  Oh, no, he needs guns to protect himself.
[03:01:12.480 --> 03:01:18.920]  There's a lot of other key news up at Infowars.com right now, but Jerome, you were pointing out
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:24.440]  that Alan Dershowitz, after I was on right before him on Piers Morgan, said I wouldn't
[03:01:24.440 --> 03:01:29.880]  be in that man's home if he disagreed with guns, implying I'm psychopathic and I'm gonna
[03:01:29.880 --> 03:01:31.600]  kill somebody with a gun.
[03:01:31.600 --> 03:01:35.020]  This is a guy that promotes torture, secret arrest, all this stuff.
[03:01:35.020 --> 03:01:37.520]  He's a joke in the legal system.
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:42.000]  He's represented all the, some of the most horrible criminals ever known.
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:47.360]  And he is a monster, and he's implying I'm violent, I'm bad, cuz I said, look, foreigner,
[03:01:47.360 --> 03:01:48.640]  stop trying to take our guns.
[03:01:48.640 --> 03:01:50.920]  But what did you wanna say to Dershowitz?
[03:01:50.920 --> 03:01:57.600]  I wanted to ask Alan Dershowitz, how would he feel if he had a disagreement with a dictator
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:06.400]  and that dictator ordered that he be killed, cuz that's what dictators do.
[03:02:06.400 --> 03:02:09.720]  You're absolutely right, let's take another call with our guest.
[03:02:09.720 --> 03:02:12.960]  But James O'Keefe, before we do that, do you wanna comment on my Piers Morgan appearance
[03:02:12.960 --> 03:02:14.880]  or the overall attack on guns?
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:19.400]  I mean, I think it takes all kinds to make the world go round, but I think it's good
[03:02:19.400 --> 03:02:21.360]  sometimes to get in their faces.
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:25.040]  If what I did was discrediting the gun owners, which they tried to spin it, why would they
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:26.720]  have me back on other shows?
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:31.680]  Why was the producer crying and screaming, get out, get out, get out, if it was a defeat
[03:02:31.680 --> 03:02:33.760]  for gun owners?
[03:02:33.760 --> 03:02:40.820]  My comment on Piers Morgan is I only wish that Project Veritas went to his house and
[03:02:40.820 --> 03:02:45.700]  asked him to put a sign on his lawn, cuz I've actually done some research and I actually
[03:02:45.700 --> 03:02:49.280]  have both of his addresses out there in California.
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:53.000]  So I think he has one property in Beverly Hills under a different name.
[03:02:53.000 --> 03:02:58.600]  So maybe you might see a video from us in the next week or two coming out on that subject.
[03:02:58.600 --> 03:03:02.240]  Oh, a little sneak peek, you're gonna be visiting Piers.
[03:03:02.240 --> 03:03:04.120]  Maybe.
[03:03:04.120 --> 03:03:05.400]  What do you need funding for?
[03:03:05.400 --> 03:03:06.400]  I bet you're doing good.
[03:03:06.400 --> 03:03:08.680]  Oh, yes, well, we do need funding.
[03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:13.600]  How about I underwrite you go into Piers' house, and then I get a plug for M4wars.com.
[03:03:13.600 --> 03:03:15.920]  You want some help there?
[03:03:15.920 --> 03:03:18.440]  We might be able to talk about that, yeah.
[03:03:18.440 --> 03:03:21.360]  Maybe I'll go to his house.
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:25.320]  We would like to go to his house and maybe not that idea because it might be he may have
[03:03:25.320 --> 03:03:29.840]  seen the video, but maybe something else, we'll have to think about it.
[03:03:29.840 --> 03:03:34.960]  Oh, I'll tell you, of course, Piers can't really come out during the day, though.
[03:03:34.960 --> 03:03:39.440]  He is a vampire, so I would, who sucks the rights out of country, he's already into England
[03:03:39.440 --> 03:03:43.800]  now, he's run over here, I would not go, I would go during the night if you wanted to
[03:03:43.800 --> 03:03:44.800]  actually come out.
[03:03:44.800 --> 03:03:46.480]  That's a good idea.
[03:03:46.480 --> 03:03:50.520]  Maybe when he gets home, I don't know, when he gets home for the weekend or something,
[03:03:50.520 --> 03:03:54.160]  he's not working very late at night or very early in the morning.
[03:03:54.160 --> 03:03:56.360]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's well known he won't come out.
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:03:58.520]  He's never been hit by sunlight.
[03:03:58.520 --> 03:03:59.520]  Is that so?
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:00.520]  Yeah.
[03:04:00.520 --> 03:04:01.520]  I'm being sarcastic.
[03:04:01.520 --> 03:04:02.520]  All right, we're gonna go to break.
[03:04:02.520 --> 03:04:03.520]  This is a short segment.
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:06.920]  Come back with Truth Raider and a few others, and then we're gonna get into, for folks that
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:10.200]  haven't seen it on your website, you went to Holder's house, you name it.
[03:04:10.200 --> 03:04:13.000]  How did you have the huevos to do that?
[03:04:13.000 --> 03:04:18.920]  It was actually, I have to compliment my reporters, we got about 18 to 24 people that go out there
[03:04:18.920 --> 03:04:24.160]  and do it, and there were three girls that went to his house, and no more than five seconds
[03:04:24.160 --> 03:04:27.880]  after they knocked on Eric Holder's door, the FBI police showed up.
[03:04:27.880 --> 03:04:43.280]  We're going to go to break, back it up, great job guys having that ready.
[03:04:43.280 --> 03:04:44.280]  That was seamless.
[03:04:44.280 --> 03:04:48.000]  We're going to come back and take a few calls, then play that, and then recap it.
[03:04:48.000 --> 03:04:51.840]  But notice the FBI's there to protect him because he's a big man.
[03:04:51.840 --> 03:04:55.960]  You the common slaves though, you don't get a gun, so he agrees with the Ku Klux Klan.
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:05:00.640]  The commoners don't get guns, only the big master gets the guns.
[03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:02.920]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:02.920 --> 03:05:09.200]  Myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we
[03:05:09.200 --> 03:05:14.200]  are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:19.840]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:05:19.840 --> 03:05:20.840]  your help.
[03:05:20.840 --> 03:05:26.080]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:05:26.080 --> 03:05:32.120]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:05:32.120 --> 03:05:35.580]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:05:35.580 --> 03:05:41.800]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:05:41.800 --> 03:05:49.240]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:05:49.240 --> 03:05:50.960]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:05:50.960 --> 03:05:53.120]  The war is here.
[03:05:53.120 --> 03:05:55.000]  It's an Infowar.
[03:05:55.000 --> 03:06:00.360]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:06.080]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[03:06:06.080 --> 03:06:09.000]  I want you to know some very important information.
[03:06:09.000 --> 03:06:13.840]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:18.160]  House at a time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer.
[03:06:18.160 --> 03:06:23.720]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.

[03:06:28.800 --> 03:06:33.940]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[03:06:33.940 --> 03:06:35.080]  normal cell.
[03:06:35.080 --> 03:06:38.840]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[03:06:38.840 --> 03:06:42.840]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.

[03:07:05.960 --> 03:07:12.240]  That's why an essential part of any emergency survival plan must be stove in a can.
[03:07:12.240 --> 03:07:17.160]  When power goes out and gas lines are down, the portable, safe, easy-to-use stove in a

[03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:11.880]  You want answers?
[03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:14.000]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:14.000 --> 03:08:18.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:22.320]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:08:22.320 --> 03:08:26.520]  Yes, and riding shotgun with us from the bottom of the hour, James O'Keefe.
[03:08:26.520 --> 03:08:31.600]  He, of course, is the legendary investigative journalist, a young guy as well, in the last
[03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:36.520]  five, six years, has brought down Acre and exposed Planned Parenthood, gotten a bunch
[03:08:36.520 --> 03:08:41.120]  of resignations and congressional investigations over NPR.
[03:08:41.120 --> 03:08:43.520]  We're going to be going back to him and a few of your phone calls that have been holding,
[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:45.040]  and then we're going to get into his program.
[03:08:45.040 --> 03:08:47.680]  We're going to play some audio and video clips here.
[03:08:47.680 --> 03:08:50.920]  Audio for radio, video for prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[03:08:50.920 --> 03:08:55.080]  Going around to Eric Holder's house, the Attorney General, saying, hey, you want our guns, will
[03:08:55.080 --> 03:08:58.360]  you turn your guns in, or will you put a gun-free zone sign at your house?
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:09:01.360]  And within 30 seconds, the FBI pulls up.
[03:09:01.360 --> 03:09:06.240]  So they've got your tax money guarding all their houses, but you're not going to get
[03:09:06.240 --> 03:09:07.240]  see.
[03:09:07.240 --> 03:09:10.720]  They're going to have guns, and they're going to have armed guards and red carpets.
[03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:14.240]  But you don't need to have a gun, okay, because they're government.
[03:09:14.240 --> 03:09:20.920]  Some of the news up at infowars.com, Feinstein rolls out draconian attack on the Second Amendment.
[03:09:20.920 --> 03:09:25.520]  That's all detailed in the well over 150 guns to be banned, because it says this gun and
[03:09:25.520 --> 03:09:29.280]  all others like it, basically, it's that interpretation, it's so dangerous.
[03:09:29.280 --> 03:09:34.800]  Congressman, Obama only upholds the Soviet Constitution, very powerful article that a
[03:09:34.800 --> 03:09:38.840]  congressman's come out and basically made some powerful statements.
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:42.920]  Here are the children murdered by drone attacks at the hands of Obama, showing you care less
[03:09:42.920 --> 03:09:43.920]  about children.
[03:09:43.920 --> 03:09:48.720]  An Iranian ambassador, only war can stop us now.
[03:09:48.720 --> 03:09:52.480]  And Michael Bloomberg's Twilight Zone, key article by Kurt Nemo, women to be drafted
[03:09:52.480 --> 03:09:53.480]  under Pentagon plan.
[03:09:53.480 --> 03:09:57.120]  That's what all this women in the military thing's about, is they want universal service.
[03:09:57.120 --> 03:10:01.480]  But the women will just be the domestic enforcers, that's their own words, the Chicago boss's
[03:10:01.480 --> 03:10:03.280]  words when he was at the White House.
[03:10:03.280 --> 03:10:07.800]  Missouri law will force gun owners to register with schools.
[03:10:07.800 --> 03:10:11.760]  This is the new thing to shame us, as the Attorney General has said, well, he should
[03:10:11.760 --> 03:10:12.760]  be ashamed.
[03:10:12.760 --> 03:10:16.200]  But we're gonna take a few calls and then get to James O'Keefe's breakdown of going
[03:10:16.200 --> 03:10:21.760]  to people's newspapers that publish gun owners names saying, why don't you put a sign saying
[03:10:21.760 --> 03:10:22.880]  no guns?
[03:10:22.880 --> 03:10:26.480]  And going to Holder's house, the Attorney General, that's coming up.
[03:10:26.480 --> 03:10:30.000]  But right now, Truth Raider in Oregon, thanks for holding her on the air.
[03:10:30.000 --> 03:10:33.360]  Hey, buddy, hey, buddy, go ahead.
[03:10:33.360 --> 03:10:34.360]  I've been vaccinated.
[03:10:34.360 --> 03:10:35.360]  I'm sick.
[03:10:35.360 --> 03:10:37.360]  Oh, are you Piers Morgan?
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:42.760]  No, I'm glad I'm not him.
[03:10:42.760 --> 03:10:45.400]  I would have terminal illness if I was that guy.
[03:10:45.400 --> 03:10:49.000]  Okay, hey, you've been holding a while, what's on your mind, bro?
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:52.240]  Well, this is what's frightening.
[03:10:52.240 --> 03:10:57.960]  I did a beta test, I went down to my local mall, wore a padded jacket.
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:03.400]  I walked through, and anytime I say, wow, this is scary.
[03:11:03.400 --> 03:11:10.400]  I could have had a Glock 19, a Tech 9, a Ruger, what have you, and I could have done business.
[03:11:10.400 --> 03:11:15.480]  Well, you're never gonna stop people that wanna do bad things, I mean, especially with
[03:11:15.480 --> 03:11:20.840]  a sheep-like population, what's your point?
[03:11:20.840 --> 03:11:23.920]  I mean, what is going on here?
[03:11:23.920 --> 03:11:32.640]  They want to take our guns from us, but then they leave everything open for fair game.
[03:11:32.640 --> 03:11:38.240]  Everything is left open, and it's like it's a hunting season.
[03:11:38.240 --> 03:11:39.240]  Everyone's-
[03:11:39.240 --> 03:11:43.360]  No, no, that's what they do, and they introduce the hunting season for crazy people is the
[03:11:43.360 --> 03:11:47.920]  public schools to go shoot people where they've disarmed everyone and made sure, hey, here's
[03:11:47.920 --> 03:11:48.920]  where the victims are.
[03:11:48.920 --> 03:11:55.440]  So, let me go back to our guest on that subject, James O'Keefe of Project Veritas, investigative
[03:11:55.440 --> 03:11:58.060]  journalist, Parx Salon.
[03:11:58.060 --> 03:12:02.240]  What about making the school's gun free and then advertising and hyping it?
[03:12:02.240 --> 03:12:06.720]  I mean, it's like they're hoping for another mass shooting to get our guns.
[03:12:06.720 --> 03:12:12.400]  Well, that's one of the things that I thought about doing with this recent Citizens Against
[03:12:12.400 --> 03:12:15.200]  Stencils Violence mockumentary we made on YouTube.
[03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:18.520]  I thought about going to the Sidwell School.
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:23.380]  This is the school where David Gregory's kids go in Washington, as well as Barack Obama's
[03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:25.080]  kids go.
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:32.120]  And I just thought it was too risky because there's secret services there, and it'd just
[03:12:32.120 --> 03:12:33.120]  be too risky.
[03:12:33.120 --> 03:12:37.440]  They'd probably arrest me immediately, but I would have loved to go to the Sidwell School
[03:12:37.440 --> 03:12:42.820]  where David Gregory's kids go and offer them to put a sign up that says this school is
[03:12:42.820 --> 03:12:43.820]  gun free.
[03:12:43.820 --> 03:12:45.160]  But see, that's your First Amendment right.
[03:12:45.160 --> 03:12:46.880]  Maybe I should go there and do that.
[03:12:46.880 --> 03:12:50.960]  And if they arrest you just to get some more news coverage, MSNBC and others said people
[03:12:50.960 --> 03:12:52.200]  are attacking their kids.
[03:12:52.200 --> 03:12:53.280]  No, we're not.
[03:12:53.280 --> 03:12:55.440]  Their kids are protected by armed guards.
[03:12:55.440 --> 03:12:58.280]  Why are they trying to block our children being protected?
[03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:00.760]  Why do they tell them crouch down and wait to be killed?
[03:13:00.760 --> 03:13:03.440]  I mean, we're not being aggressive to them.
[03:13:03.440 --> 03:13:06.320]  They're trying to make sure we can't protect ourselves.
[03:13:06.320 --> 03:13:08.520]  They're trying to make sure we're fair game.
[03:13:08.520 --> 03:13:09.880]  They're assaulting us.
[03:13:09.880 --> 03:13:12.560]  Well, maybe you should go to the Sidwell School and do it.
[03:13:12.560 --> 03:13:16.000]  You'd have more moxie than me if you chose to do that.
[03:13:16.000 --> 03:13:21.760]  I've been arrested, Alex, and I have to raise the money privately, and it's difficult for
[03:13:21.760 --> 03:13:22.760]  us sometimes.
[03:13:22.760 --> 03:13:27.680]  No, I've been arrested quite a few times too, but I always drop the charges because I haven't
[03:13:27.680 --> 03:13:28.680]  done anything.
[03:13:28.680 --> 03:13:32.400]  I mean, if I went up to the edge of the school and started and saying, I'd like to offer
[03:13:32.400 --> 03:13:33.400]  or knock, knock.
[03:13:33.400 --> 03:13:36.080]  Hi, I'd like to offer you this sign that you're a gun free zone.
[03:13:36.080 --> 03:13:37.600]  Oh, but you've got guns.
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:38.600]  Well, why is that?
[03:13:38.600 --> 03:13:40.600]  Why do you have guns?
[03:13:40.600 --> 03:13:42.600]  Do you not like children?
[03:13:42.600 --> 03:13:45.360]  You want to support the death children or something like that?
[03:13:45.360 --> 03:13:49.000]  Yeah, but I mean, and again, in the free country, we'd get arrested.
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:52.240]  Well, let's talk about this clip, because some stations just joined us.
[03:13:52.240 --> 03:13:55.600]  Tell folks what you did again, and then we're going to play the clip of going to the Attorney
[03:13:55.600 --> 03:13:56.640]  General's house.
[03:13:56.640 --> 03:14:00.880]  So we posed this group called Citizens Against Senseless Violence.
[03:14:00.880 --> 03:14:08.520]  We posed as an anti-gun group, and we made a little advertising campaign to go along
[03:14:08.520 --> 03:14:14.520]  with it, with white t-shirts, and we said, we want to save the children, guns kill children,
[03:14:14.520 --> 03:14:15.520]  guns are bad.
[03:14:15.520 --> 03:14:22.080]  And we went to the homes of politicians, journalists, and Attorney General Eric Holder, MSNBC, Star
[03:14:22.080 --> 03:14:24.440]  Ledger, Westchester Journal News.
[03:14:24.440 --> 03:14:27.280]  They printed the names of gun owners.
[03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:30.960]  And we went to the home of Eric Holder, which is a clip you're about to play in northwest
[03:14:30.960 --> 03:14:35.920]  Washington DC, and within five seconds of knocking on Eric Holder's door to put a sign
[03:14:35.920 --> 03:14:40.660]  on his lawn that says this home is gun free, the FBI police showed up.
[03:14:40.660 --> 03:14:46.920]  Now imagine if the public schools had a couple cops at them, or just teachers trained and
[03:14:46.920 --> 03:14:51.480]  armed, it would be the same thing, but no, only he gets 24 hour guard service.
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:59.640]  And Alex, not only does Eric Holder get FBI police protection 24 hours, journalists at
[03:14:59.640 --> 03:15:05.760]  the Westchester Journal News had 24 hour armed guards protecting their homes as well.
[03:15:05.760 --> 03:15:11.120]  Yeah, I saw that because the evil gun owners had been calling them and my gosh, they better
[03:15:11.120 --> 03:15:13.480]  have armed guards now.
[03:15:13.480 --> 03:15:14.480]  I saw that in the news.
[03:15:14.480 --> 03:15:16.720]  Did that happen after you went to their houses or before?
[03:15:16.720 --> 03:15:19.840]  That happened before that started happening.
[03:15:19.840 --> 03:15:25.200]  There was a program on Fox, Judge Janine, she actually went to two of their homes a
[03:15:25.200 --> 03:15:29.840]  few days before we did, and she caught the same thing.
[03:15:29.840 --> 03:15:30.840]  So they had been there.
[03:15:30.840 --> 03:15:34.520]  And so they were scared of a Fox TV host like they were gonna come kill them.
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:37.920]  I mean, again, these people are nuts, and then they have guns protecting them.
[03:15:37.920 --> 03:15:43.480]  I mean, it's just, and they always say, Israel doesn't have guns, don't bring that up, NRA's
[03:15:43.480 --> 03:15:44.480]  wrong.
[03:15:44.480 --> 03:15:45.960]  It's wrong to say we're armed.
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:50.400]  They say we're discredited by bringing this up because it's what discredits them.
[03:15:50.400 --> 03:15:55.480]  And they're saying, please, throw us in the briar patch, stop doing this.
[03:15:55.480 --> 03:15:59.880]  They know it's effective, that's why they're telling us, this isn't effective, stop it,
[03:15:59.880 --> 03:16:00.880]  stop it.
[03:16:00.880 --> 03:16:08.000]  Right, well, even the Washington Post, Alex, put out a piece that was very positive about
[03:16:08.000 --> 03:16:09.280]  this recent investigation.
[03:16:09.280 --> 03:16:14.320]  So some people in the mainstream media appreciate the fact that we're exposing frauds.
[03:16:14.320 --> 03:16:18.240]  I think it's a winning issue when you expose them to be frauds and cowards.
[03:16:18.240 --> 03:16:19.240]  Well it's more than that.
[03:16:19.240 --> 03:16:22.400]  When the Washington Post came out and said don't publish people's names, this has happened
[03:16:22.400 --> 03:16:24.960]  over the last few decades, people always get mad.
[03:16:24.960 --> 03:16:27.660]  The Washington Post doesn't wanna upset us too much.
[03:16:27.660 --> 03:16:30.480]  They're telling the other liberals, we'll get them later.
[03:16:30.480 --> 03:16:34.520]  Don't rile them up, because they're scared of us coming to their houses.
[03:16:34.520 --> 03:16:38.160]  They're scared of us pointing out they've got armed guards, they wanna shut this down.
[03:16:38.160 --> 03:16:45.040]  They don't wanna be, the journalists definitely do not want to be personally exposed.
[03:16:45.040 --> 03:16:50.960]  But that's what they've been doing to us peasants, I call us peasants.
[03:16:50.960 --> 03:16:55.560]  That's what they've been doing to the common people for decades, so it's time that we expose
[03:16:55.560 --> 03:16:56.560]  the journalists.
[03:16:56.560 --> 03:16:57.800]  Absolutely, it's time.
[03:16:57.800 --> 03:17:00.920]  Let's talk to, no, let's go ahead and play this clip.
[03:17:00.920 --> 03:17:05.400]  Here's the clip with the group going to Attorney General's house.
[03:17:05.400 --> 03:17:10.320]  Home of Eric Holder, US Attorney General, Washington DC, here it is.
[03:17:10.320 --> 03:17:17.880]  We're on camera, they say, three women, how can I help you?
[03:17:17.880 --> 03:17:25.240]  Less than 30 seconds, the police, federal police.
[03:17:25.240 --> 03:17:45.120]  We're in a newly formed group, the hair not home right now.
[03:17:45.120 --> 03:18:01.360]  Four slam two, signs rejected two.
[03:18:01.360 --> 03:18:06.400]  Why you don't want us to know that you don't have guns, cuz we know you do.
[03:18:06.400 --> 03:18:15.680]  We're assuming this is a gun-free household, I think that's correct.
[03:18:15.680 --> 03:18:20.680]  Thank you for the visit, I'm not gonna speak on your signs.
[03:18:20.680 --> 03:18:21.680]  I appreciate what you're doing, but by the same token, I'm gonna pass on the signs.
[03:18:21.680 --> 03:18:25.400]  Yeah, nobody wants to say there's no gun in their house, they're all gonna have guns,
[03:18:25.400 --> 03:18:27.040]  they've all got their little commie cards.
[03:18:27.040 --> 03:18:29.040]  Violence, can we sign you up?
[03:18:29.040 --> 03:18:30.040]  No thanks.
[03:18:30.040 --> 03:18:35.040]  Yeah, any particular reason, are you gun owners or?
[03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:39.080]  I agree with you, I don't want to sign you up.
[03:18:39.080 --> 03:18:42.800]  These so-called liberals, these authoritarians are so dumb, they're like, I agree with you,
[03:18:42.800 --> 03:18:47.000]  every home should be gun-free, but no, I'm not taking your sign.
[03:18:47.000 --> 03:18:48.000]  Police getting called on them.
[03:18:48.000 --> 03:18:51.960]  A single member of the media, willing to live up to the strength of their convictions.
[03:18:51.960 --> 03:18:56.620]  Now a final parting thought from our good friend Bob Braun at the Star Ledger, which
[03:18:56.620 --> 03:18:59.360]  also wants to target law-abiding gun owners.
[03:18:59.360 --> 03:19:05.120]  I was trying to get a nasty note from one of my most progressive friends who says, because
[03:19:05.120 --> 03:19:10.120]  I wrote a column, I'm a columnist, and I wrote a column against, for sure your gun was, and
[03:19:10.120 --> 03:19:15.680]  he said, you're a fool because when the right wing takes over the government, we're gonna
[03:19:15.680 --> 03:19:16.680]  need guns.
[03:19:16.680 --> 03:19:19.680]  So he's worried the right wing's gonna take over and then?
[03:19:19.680 --> 03:19:23.520]  Yeah, and there'll be guns to fight them back.
[03:19:23.520 --> 03:19:27.520]  Then I said, but they got the army, you know, they got the army and the navy and the marines
[03:19:27.520 --> 03:19:28.520]  and everything else.
[03:19:28.520 --> 03:19:32.880]  Right, so he's gonna be a revolutionary too, but you know.
[03:19:32.880 --> 03:19:35.720]  There you go, the insiders are talking about a revolution.
[03:19:35.720 --> 03:19:39.020]  This is their revolution to get our guns and take over.
[03:19:39.020 --> 03:19:43.380]  Final segment with our guest straight ahead, we'll give you the website as well to go see
[03:19:43.380 --> 03:19:44.380]  all the videos.
[03:19:44.380 --> 03:20:01.520]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com, and we're streaming video at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:20:01.520 --> 03:20:07.920]  Hello I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the infowars.com team want to relay to you and
[03:20:07.920 --> 03:20:14.200]  your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every front.
[03:20:14.200 --> 03:20:19.840]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[03:20:19.840 --> 03:20:20.840]  your help.
[03:20:20.840 --> 03:20:26.080]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at infowars.com, you will wake up
[03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:32.100]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[03:20:32.100 --> 03:20:35.560]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[03:20:35.560 --> 03:20:41.760]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[03:20:41.760 --> 03:20:49.240]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[03:20:49.240 --> 03:20:50.840]  and ultimate extermination.
[03:20:50.840 --> 03:21:01.520]  The war is here, it's an infowar, the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[03:21:01.520 --> 03:21:06.360]  Looking back on 2012, we ask ourselves, how did we ever survive from natural disasters
[03:21:06.360 --> 03:21:10.940]  like hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought to the family hardships brought on
[03:21:10.940 --> 03:21:12.800]  by a disastrous economy?
[03:21:12.800 --> 03:21:15.520]  Our hearts go out to those that have lost everything.
[03:21:15.520 --> 03:21:19.320]  At e-foods direct, we hear from customers every day that are fortunate enough to weather
[03:21:19.320 --> 03:21:22.240]  life storm by having a supply of food on hand.
[03:21:22.240 --> 03:21:26.780]  After hurricane Sandy, Danny from New York City wrote, almost all of the grocery stores
[03:21:26.780 --> 03:21:31.600]  are closed, but I managed to get my e-foods just in time to be able to help my sister
[03:21:31.600 --> 03:21:32.600]  and niece.
[03:21:32.600 --> 03:21:36.400]  It is better to be prepared 10 years too early than one day too late.
[03:21:36.400 --> 03:21:38.640]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[03:21:38.640 --> 03:21:41.000]  Read the warnings and do what Alex has done.

[03:22:30.320 --> 03:22:32.000]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:35.720]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[03:22:35.720 --> 03:22:36.720]  IRAs?
[03:22:36.720 --> 03:22:40.800]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[03:22:40.800 --> 03:22:42.480]  of gold for your retirement.
[03:22:42.480 --> 03:22:45.960]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[03:22:45.960 --> 03:22:50.960]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[03:23:09.000 --> 03:23:12.440]  Those we should be able to depend on, let us down.
[03:23:12.440 --> 03:23:16.960]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in
[03:23:16.960 --> 03:23:19.040]  Bell Harbor say show me.
[03:23:19.040 --> 03:23:21.480]  Don't depend on the government to save you.

[03:23:58.040 --> 03:24:07.480]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[03:24:07.480 --> 03:24:10.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:24:10.400 --> 03:24:18.640]  By the way, you know, I've got to spend time trying to make money to fund the syndicated
[03:24:18.640 --> 03:24:21.880]  radio show, the crew, the filmmaking, the nightly news, all of it.
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:25.160]  And you guys have done a great job out there supporting us over the years with the products
[03:24:25.160 --> 03:24:27.280]  we sell at Infowars.com.
[03:24:27.280 --> 03:24:31.160]  I got approached last year by one of the, and I wasn't even a big skater, though I did
[03:24:31.160 --> 03:24:32.160]  like skateboards.
[03:24:32.160 --> 03:24:34.240]  I just wasn't very good at it compared to my friends.
[03:24:34.240 --> 03:24:38.600]  You know, we go skate at the parking garages, all of it growing up.
[03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:42.080]  But I mean, everybody knows Alien Workshop, probably the name in skateboards.
[03:24:42.080 --> 03:24:45.680]  They approached us about six months ago and said, would you like to put out a custom line
[03:24:45.680 --> 03:24:49.840]  of Infowars skateboards that come out at the regular price but are custom?
[03:24:49.840 --> 03:24:50.840]  And I said, absolutely.
[03:24:50.840 --> 03:24:55.780]  So those are now available for sale at InfowarsShop.com and they're gonna come out with more and more.
[03:24:55.780 --> 03:25:01.160]  But custom Infowars, limited edition, Divide and Conquer, look at that artwork inspired
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:03.200]  by our work.
[03:25:03.200 --> 03:25:07.600]  And they're great artists of the left and right and how they control both Republicans
[03:25:07.600 --> 03:25:09.120]  and Democrats.
[03:25:09.120 --> 03:25:13.960]  Divide and Conquer Alien Workshop, that's just one of them and they've got a brainwashing
[03:25:13.960 --> 03:25:14.960]  one.
[03:25:14.960 --> 03:25:22.200]  And this is just a test, Brainwash Skate Deck, 49.95, Divide and Conquer, 49.95.
[03:25:22.200 --> 03:25:26.920]  I mean, that's a super high quality skateboard, $49 and you put your wheels on it wherever
[03:25:26.920 --> 03:25:29.520]  you custom have there and like.
[03:25:29.520 --> 03:25:32.200]  So there you have it and there's gonna be a bunch more coming out, but those are limited
[03:25:32.200 --> 03:25:35.360]  edition, available right now at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:40.880]  James O'Keefe, we gotta talk in the next few days off air when you get time and I get time.
[03:25:40.880 --> 03:25:43.360]  I've been meaning to get a hold of you for years, stuff falls to the cracks.
[03:25:43.360 --> 03:25:46.480]  I salute what you've done, I salute your work.
[03:25:46.480 --> 03:25:50.000]  We've got a lady who wants to talk to you, Susan, real fast in California, who says you
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:25:51.000]  inspired her.
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:55.280]  Susan, real fast, you're on the air with the head of the Project Veritas.
[03:25:55.280 --> 03:26:00.240]  Thank you very much, Alex and James, I met you a couple of years ago at a pro-life block.
[03:26:00.240 --> 03:26:05.600]  You made a very inspiring speech telling everyone that even though we may be small in number
[03:26:05.600 --> 03:26:12.240]  at the time, that everyone can make an action that causes a reaction.
[03:26:12.240 --> 03:26:18.440]  And because of you, I started speaking up about the problems within Girl Scouts and
[03:26:18.440 --> 03:26:21.320]  how they have a very pro-abortion agenda and-
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:24.400]  Oh, it's total brainwashing, total brainwashing.
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:27.080]  I would love for you to cover this because this is cookie season.
[03:26:27.080 --> 03:26:31.680]  I mean, they are at the height of their selling at this very moment.
[03:26:31.680 --> 03:26:39.120]  And if you would let your listeners become enlightened on how deep they go into indoctrinating-
[03:26:39.120 --> 03:26:43.200]  Oh, no, no, no, type in Girl Scouts trained to fight terrorists.
[03:26:43.200 --> 03:26:46.200]  And then you actually get the training, it's what are mommy and daddy doing?
[03:26:46.200 --> 03:26:49.840]  In fact, were you aware of this, James, it sounds crazy, but it's really happening.
[03:26:49.840 --> 03:26:53.480]  I've heard something about the Girl Scouts and abortion.
[03:26:53.480 --> 03:26:57.720]  I haven't- Tell him what they're doing, Susan.
[03:26:57.720 --> 03:27:03.280]  It's beyond that, just last month in December, the Girl Scouts representing its 10 million
[03:27:03.280 --> 03:27:08.080]  members around the world were at the Global Youth Forum in Bali.
[03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:12.780]  They actually were on the steering committee.
[03:27:12.780 --> 03:27:18.800]  And they came up with a statement asking for legalization of prostitution.
[03:27:18.800 --> 03:27:21.080]  Oh, my God, that's breaking news.
[03:27:21.080 --> 03:27:24.160]  Do me a favor, send that to showtipsatinfowars.com.
[03:27:24.160 --> 03:27:25.760]  Show tips, okay.
[03:27:25.760 --> 03:27:30.720]  Yeah, show tips, and it's all about trafficking women, it's all about exterminating them once
[03:27:30.720 --> 03:27:33.520]  they have babies, aborting them, just amazing.
[03:27:33.520 --> 03:27:35.760]  We'll look into that, showtipsatinfowars.com.
[03:27:35.760 --> 03:27:40.160]  James, thanks for all the time, we got three minutes in closing here in this segment.
[03:27:40.160 --> 03:27:43.120]  What else would you like to impart to everybody out there?
[03:27:43.120 --> 03:27:47.440]  Well, I wanted to reemphasize what I said before.
[03:27:47.440 --> 03:27:51.680]  I believe the way to change the world is through journalism.
[03:27:51.680 --> 03:27:56.520]  And the listener in California just said, I actually did do a little site, it's remarkable
[03:27:56.520 --> 03:28:00.080]  that it's a small world because I was out in California about three years ago giving
[03:28:00.080 --> 03:28:01.080]  a talk.
[03:28:01.080 --> 03:28:05.800]  And she's right, you produce a consequence that produces a reaction.
[03:28:05.800 --> 03:28:10.520]  And if you expose something that's so outrageous that forces people to react to you, and it's
[03:28:10.520 --> 03:28:15.440]  that reaction that gets into the news, and then whenever they, like in this case when
[03:28:15.440 --> 03:28:21.680]  Toure reacted to our gun video, I'm sure the MSNBC people were saying, Toure, don't say
[03:28:21.680 --> 03:28:24.560]  anything, you're just going to give oxygen to a story.
[03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:33.020]  So we have proven that citizen journalists can actually change laws, force politicians
[03:28:33.020 --> 03:28:34.400]  to act.
[03:28:34.400 --> 03:28:36.840]  And in the next year, we're going to triple our efforts.
[03:28:36.840 --> 03:28:43.880]  You can follow us at Project Veritas, that's Project Veritas.com.
[03:28:43.880 --> 03:28:46.760]  And if you want to get involved in one of these video projects, if you want to be a
[03:28:46.760 --> 03:28:51.760]  videographer, if you want to be trained to go undercover, contact our website, send us
[03:28:51.760 --> 03:28:54.820]  a tip, and we'll put you out in the field.
[03:28:54.820 --> 03:28:56.880]  There you go, info warriors.
[03:28:56.880 --> 03:29:01.680]  The fight is now, the war is now, whether it's We Are Change or Veritas, or you want
[03:29:01.680 --> 03:29:05.520]  to say you're an info warrior reporter just uploading to YouTube, then we can use clips
[03:29:05.520 --> 03:29:06.520]  on our show.
[03:29:06.520 --> 03:29:10.680]  It doesn't matter, help out Veritas, help out info wars, get involved in We Are Change.
[03:29:10.680 --> 03:29:16.980]  We're all in this together, and it is so exciting to see the powerful alternative media now
[03:29:16.980 --> 03:29:18.020]  really together.
[03:29:18.020 --> 03:29:23.000]  We overshadow the dinosaur media, and that's why they're panicking with the DrudgeReport.com
[03:29:23.000 --> 03:29:26.800]  and WorldNetDaily and countless others, very, very exciting.
[03:29:26.800 --> 03:29:30.920]  Hey, tell my producer here, James, as you leave, when is a good time for me?
[03:29:30.920 --> 03:29:34.800]  A couple of windows to try to give you a call the next few days, okay?
[03:29:34.800 --> 03:29:35.800]  Okay, will do.
[03:29:35.800 --> 03:29:39.360]  All right, James, thank you so much, very, very exciting, ladies and gentlemen, thank
[03:29:39.360 --> 03:29:40.360]  you.
[03:29:40.360 --> 03:29:43.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, they're attacking us right now, okay?
[03:29:43.400 --> 03:29:46.800]  So I'm not looking for any trouble, but they started the fight.
[03:29:46.800 --> 03:29:50.720]  I say we stomp their butt in the info war.
[03:29:50.720 --> 03:29:54.360]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:54.360 --> 03:30:01.160]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
