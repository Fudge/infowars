[00:24.400 --> 00:27.520]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:27.520 --> 00:29.280]  You, you white male!
[00:29.280 --> 00:34.080]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[00:34.080 --> 00:37.280]  Move it! Get out of the way!
[00:38.640 --> 00:44.800]  We pledge allegiance to one flag, and that flag is the American flag.
[00:44.800 --> 00:49.120]  Info wars helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[00:49.120 --> 00:52.720]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[00:52.720 --> 00:54.240]  I will not let you down.
[00:54.240 --> 00:58.960]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[00:58.960 --> 01:01.040]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[01:01.040 --> 01:06.720]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.
[01:06.720 --> 01:10.400]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones.
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.000]  We have a rather ambivalent attitude to science at present.
[01:22.320 --> 01:26.960]  We have come to expect a steady increase in the standard of living,
[01:26.960 --> 01:32.160]  that science and technology have brought, but people distrust science,
[01:32.160 --> 01:36.240]  because they don't understand it, or feel they can control it.
[01:40.480 --> 01:44.240]  The popularity of science fiction like Star Trek
[01:44.240 --> 01:48.560]  is because this is the form of science with which people feel safe.
[01:48.560 --> 01:57.440]  But an understanding of science fact would lay their fears to rest much better.
[02:00.320 --> 02:03.200]  Stephen Hawking, one of the smartest men on the planet,
[02:03.200 --> 02:05.840]  has predicted that we will die out within a thousand years
[02:05.840 --> 02:08.240]  if we do not colonize new worlds and planets.
[02:08.960 --> 02:10.800]  However, with the prediction this severe,
[02:10.800 --> 02:15.040]  the government still refuses to act with more funding to our space program.
[02:15.040 --> 02:19.280]  Instead of funding vital space programs, Obama has spent millions,
[02:19.280 --> 02:21.920]  billions, and even trillions on frivolous purchases
[02:21.920 --> 02:24.000]  that will never benefit us as a country.
[02:24.560 --> 02:27.680]  He spent over two million dollars on a study
[02:27.680 --> 02:31.600]  which concluded that children do not like food that has been sneezed on.
[02:31.600 --> 02:33.600]  These people are true geniuses, by the way.
[02:33.600 --> 02:38.160]  He also spent over half a million on a medieval smells exhibit.
[02:38.160 --> 02:40.400]  Just, you can't make this stuff up, people.
[02:40.400 --> 02:47.760]  He spent over trillion dollars on the failed F-35 military aircraft program,
[02:47.760 --> 02:49.440]  which still proves to be a waste
[02:49.440 --> 02:51.600]  and has never been flown one of these things.
[02:51.600 --> 02:54.640]  We need to be redirecting money into the space program.
[02:55.760 --> 02:57.280]  But our modern government says no.
[02:58.640 --> 03:02.880]  We continue to waste money while we could be saving lives in the future.
[03:02.880 --> 03:04.880]  Back when Ma Granpope was a boy,
[03:04.880 --> 03:08.560]  he had role models such as Buzz, Aldrin, and Chuck Yeager to look up to.
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.080]  Nowadays, we have Kim Kardashian and Amy Schumer,
[03:12.080 --> 03:15.200]  people who teach us nothing and just make us waste our time.
[03:15.200 --> 03:19.680]  Things indeed look dark, for we have traded our adventurous spirit
[03:19.680 --> 03:23.040]  and lifestyle for Snapchat and Diet Coke.
[03:23.040 --> 03:24.720]  There is some good news, though.
[03:24.720 --> 03:30.400]  Tesla founder and CEO, Elon Musk, has lately been inspiring thousands,
[03:30.400 --> 03:36.400]  or even millions, with his message of private space exploration at his new company, SpaceX.
[03:36.400 --> 03:40.480]  His company has already achieved many things with very few failures, if at all.
[03:41.760 --> 03:43.680]  They've already sent rockets into space.
[03:43.680 --> 03:45.360]  They've already done exploration.
[03:45.360 --> 03:46.640]  They're already achieving this.
[03:47.520 --> 03:49.360]  They're not even funded by the government.
[03:49.360 --> 03:50.800]  They don't even get that much money,
[03:50.800 --> 03:52.480]  but they still do a better job than NASA.
[03:53.040 --> 03:54.080]  And you want to know why?
[03:54.080 --> 03:55.600]  It's because of ingenuity.
[03:55.600 --> 03:58.400]  These people are united and they want to make a difference.
[03:58.400 --> 03:59.600]  They want us to explore.
[03:59.600 --> 04:00.800]  They want us to get off the planet.
[04:00.800 --> 04:02.320]  They want us to survive.
[04:02.320 --> 04:05.200]  We need to adopt that mindset for ourselves.
[04:05.200 --> 04:08.160]  Imagine what we can do with this man,
[04:08.160 --> 04:11.440]  who is now President Trump's advisor in the future.
[04:11.440 --> 04:15.120]  But to fully utilize the resources that we have available,
[04:15.120 --> 04:17.760]  we have to change as a culture, as a mindset.
[04:17.760 --> 04:20.480]  We have to say that we want to explore, that we want to get out there,
[04:20.480 --> 04:23.120]  that we just don't want to sit on our iPhones on the couch anymore,
[04:23.120 --> 04:25.040]  getting fatter and fatter and drinking more slurpees.
[04:26.000 --> 04:26.960]  You have to choose.
[04:26.960 --> 04:29.840]  You have to make the conscious decision to change
[04:29.840 --> 04:34.720]  and to follow where our forefathers did, to the next frontier,
[04:34.720 --> 04:37.280]  and space is the final frontier.
[04:37.280 --> 05:00.640]  This is Rex Jones reporting for infowars.com.
[05:00.640 --> 05:04.240]  On New Year's Day in Kiev, there was a torchlight procession.
[05:04.240 --> 05:07.520]  The Ukrainian neo-Nazis were marching through the center of the capital,
[05:07.520 --> 05:10.080]  celebrating the birthday of Stepan Bandera,
[05:10.080 --> 05:12.000]  the leader of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army,
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.440]  who was also Nazi sympathizer and collaborator during World War II.
[05:15.440 --> 05:18.880]  All the more reasons to be hailed as hero by the Maidan government.
[05:18.880 --> 05:21.840]  The followers of Bandera are proudly promoting Nazi slogans
[05:21.840 --> 05:23.520]  and the symbolics of the Third Reich,
[05:23.520 --> 05:25.600]  hence their love for torchlight processions,
[05:25.600 --> 05:27.680]  which were especially popular in Hitler's Germany.
[05:27.680 --> 05:30.560]  The present-day admirers of Bandera are deeply misled.
[05:30.560 --> 05:32.400]  They glorify the myths given to them,
[05:32.400 --> 05:36.000]  conveniently ignoring the facts of history repeated in present-day Ukraine.
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.360]  They murder their own countrymen under the guise of liberation of the people.
[05:39.360 --> 05:41.520]  They murder their own ideological supporters,
[05:41.520 --> 05:43.040]  who happen to choose a different leader,
[05:43.040 --> 05:45.520]  and they call it fighting for their country's independence.
[05:45.520 --> 05:49.360]  They murder and betray each other under the guise of unity and brotherhood.
[05:49.360 --> 05:50.960]  Well, let's call it for what it is.
[05:50.960 --> 05:51.840]  Betrayal.
[05:51.840 --> 05:53.760]  Betrayal of your people and your country,
[05:53.760 --> 05:57.680]  and the enemy within is more dangerous than any outside threat.
[05:57.680 --> 06:00.560]  This has been Daria for infowars.com.
[06:00.560 --> 06:04.320]  All across the Western world, MSM is attempting to demonize
[06:04.320 --> 06:06.160]  the language and words we use, saying,
[06:06.160 --> 06:08.480]  don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays.
[06:08.480 --> 06:10.000]  And now they say, don't use holiday.
[06:10.000 --> 06:11.520]  Oh, I got some news for them.
[06:11.520 --> 06:14.800]  We're going to continue to use the speech we feel like using,
[06:14.800 --> 06:16.720]  and we're going to exercise the First Amendment
[06:16.720 --> 06:19.200]  in your globalist tyrannical faces.
[06:19.200 --> 06:22.640]  And that's why I'm extending the Christmas sale this year,

[07:00.320 --> 07:03.600]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[07:03.600 --> 07:05.920]  Deep Cleans by infowarslife.com.
[07:05.920 --> 07:10.080]  A scientifically formulated blend of nanocoloidal zeolites and organic ingredients
[07:10.080 --> 07:12.880]  that aid the body in cleansing chemicals and toxic metals.
[07:12.880 --> 07:15.920]  Using on proprietary multi-step extraction technology,
[07:15.920 --> 07:18.240]  deep cleanse are most affordable all-in-one cleanser.
[07:18.240 --> 07:22.560]  With concentrated organic compounds like cilantro, milk thistle,
[07:22.560 --> 07:25.680]  folvic acid, orange peel, zeolites, and others,
[07:25.680 --> 07:27.680]  deep cleanse doesn't hold back.
[07:27.680 --> 07:31.200]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products,
[07:31.200 --> 07:33.440]  we use decades-old scientific research
[07:33.440 --> 07:36.640]  to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[07:36.640 --> 07:39.840]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market

[07:54.960 --> 07:59.440]  That's infowarslife.com, or call 888-253-3139.
[08:07.440 --> 08:08.000]  This is me.
[08:08.640 --> 08:10.080]  I'm so good, there's no people.
[08:11.120 --> 08:14.560]  In the councils of government, we must guard against
[08:14.560 --> 08:17.200]  the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[08:17.200 --> 08:21.520]  whether sought or unsought, by the military industrial complex.
[08:23.360 --> 08:27.120]  I hereby declare this to be an unlawful assembly.
[08:27.120 --> 08:30.720]  I order all those assembled to immediately disperse.
[08:30.720 --> 08:33.600]  It's a military mission in North St. Louis.
[08:33.600 --> 08:36.160]  Heavily armored vehicles are rolling into town,
[08:36.160 --> 08:39.280]  and don't be alarmed if you see those over the next seven days,
[08:39.280 --> 08:40.880]  rolling through your neighborhood.
[08:40.880 --> 08:44.320]  If you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis,
[08:44.320 --> 08:45.600]  do not be alarmed.
[08:45.600 --> 08:47.920]  Guns will be taken, no one will be able to be armed.
[08:47.920 --> 08:49.200]  We will take all weapons.
[08:49.200 --> 08:51.600]  Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[08:51.600 --> 08:56.160]  Just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way.
[08:56.160 --> 08:56.960]  Enough.
[08:56.960 --> 08:57.760]  Enough.
[08:57.760 --> 08:58.160]  Enough.
[08:58.800 --> 08:59.280]  Enough.
[08:59.280 --> 09:03.760]  The Department of Homeland Security is apparently on a huge ammo buying spree.
[09:03.760 --> 09:08.080]  It comes out to like 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition.
[09:08.080 --> 09:10.480]  And as KSLA News 12 Jeff Ferrell discovered,
[09:10.480 --> 09:15.280]  the clergy would help the government with potentially their biggest problem, us.
[09:15.280 --> 09:18.080]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea
[09:18.080 --> 09:19.920]  that kids belong to their parents,
[09:19.920 --> 09:21.280]  or kids belong to their families,
[09:21.280 --> 09:23.360]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[09:23.360 --> 09:26.000]  If you got a business, you didn't build that.
[09:26.960 --> 09:28.640]  Somebody else made that happen.
[09:29.360 --> 09:32.640]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids,
[09:32.640 --> 09:35.680]  according to two new studies in the journal Pediatric.
[09:35.680 --> 09:38.240]  Black Hawk choppers soaring through the night sky,
[09:38.240 --> 09:40.640]  but this is only a drill.
[09:40.640 --> 09:44.320]  Heavily armed officers in Watertown search for the suspect,
[09:44.320 --> 09:45.440]  house to house.
[09:53.040 --> 09:55.440]  It's a joint military training exercise,
[09:55.440 --> 09:58.160]  involving local police, also military.
[09:59.680 --> 10:00.800]  I am in my apartment, sir.
[10:00.800 --> 10:02.000]  The backing song right now.
[10:02.000 --> 10:03.040]  I am inside.
[10:03.040 --> 10:04.240]  I have two words for you.
[10:04.960 --> 10:05.920]  Predator gloves.
[10:06.800 --> 10:08.000]  You will never see it coming.
[10:08.000 --> 10:14.800]  The dramatic scene played out in front of our cameras,
[10:14.800 --> 10:17.200]  parents grabbing their children and running
[10:17.200 --> 10:19.600]  after spending the night hunkering in their houses
[10:19.600 --> 10:21.440]  and then finding themselves face-to-face
[10:21.440 --> 10:24.000]  with the muzzle of a SWAT officer's rifle.
[10:24.000 --> 10:24.960]  They let them in the area.
[10:24.960 --> 10:26.160]  They told them they could come in,
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.160]  and now they're coming in like they're trespassers,
[10:28.160 --> 10:29.520]  punching and shoving people.
[10:29.520 --> 10:31.360]  We're not turning our guns in,
[10:31.360 --> 10:32.560]  and we're not running,
[10:32.560 --> 10:34.560]  and we're not backing down,
[10:34.560 --> 10:38.240]  if you want a commentator.
[10:38.240 --> 10:40.080]  We are on the march.
[10:40.080 --> 10:42.880]  The Empire is on the run.
[10:42.880 --> 10:46.160]  Live from the Infowars.com studios,
[10:46.160 --> 10:47.680]  it's Alex Jones.
[10:47.680 --> 10:50.960]  This is the revolution in their mind.
[10:50.960 --> 10:53.920]  Yeah, too bad to stop too far.
[10:53.920 --> 10:57.920]  Oh, there's no way all they wait to have to live.
[10:57.920 --> 11:00.800]  And all they hate never really are.
[11:00.800 --> 11:04.480]  The potential for the disastrous rise
[11:04.480 --> 11:07.920]  of misplaced power exists, and will persist.
[11:07.920 --> 11:10.960]  This is the heart of 1776.
[11:10.960 --> 11:22.080]  An army of idiots is convinced that 2016 is the worst year ever,
[11:22.080 --> 11:25.040]  because Trump won and some celebrities died.
[11:25.040 --> 11:27.040]  David Bowie left us. George Michael left us.
[11:27.040 --> 11:28.960]  Carrie Fisher left us. Prince left us.
[11:28.960 --> 11:31.440]  We elected Donald f***ing Trump.
[11:31.440 --> 11:33.600]  2016 worst year ever.
[11:33.600 --> 11:35.920]  2016 worst year ever.
[11:35.920 --> 11:37.440]  Don't take Carrie Fisher away from us, please.
[11:37.440 --> 11:38.640]  Take Trump instead.
[11:38.640 --> 11:42.000]  So, with all these celebrity deaths and a cheeto puff becoming president,
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.960]  people are considering 2016 to be the worst year ever.
[11:44.960 --> 11:47.600]  I don't know if this is the worst year ever for celeb deaths,
[11:47.600 --> 11:49.200]  but it sure feels like it.
[11:49.200 --> 11:51.360]  F*** you, 2016. Good riddance.
[11:51.360 --> 11:53.840]  It's official, 2016 has been the worst year ever,
[11:53.840 --> 11:55.680]  and the highest year for celebrity deaths.
[11:55.680 --> 11:58.080]  2017 better get here soon, or I know.
[11:58.080 --> 11:59.840]  Hashtag 2016, fix.
[11:59.840 --> 12:01.840]  2017 is only a few days away.
[12:01.840 --> 12:08.640]  Thank God we can finally say goodbye to the worst year ever.
[12:08.640 --> 12:12.320]  Right, so because some random actors and musicians that you never met,
[12:12.320 --> 12:15.600]  knew, or really cared about before they died, died,
[12:15.600 --> 12:18.400]  and because some political outcomes didn't go your way,
[12:18.400 --> 12:22.320]  that makes 2016 the worst year ever.
[12:22.320 --> 12:23.360]  Get a grip.
[12:23.360 --> 12:28.720]  The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic killed 50 to 100 million people.
[12:28.720 --> 12:31.120]  5% of the world's population.
[12:31.120 --> 12:35.280]  Yeah, that probably affected more people than Carrie Fisher passing away.
[12:35.280 --> 12:39.840]  The Soviet famine of 32 to 33 killed so many millions of people,
[12:39.840 --> 12:42.000]  we don't even know the actual number.
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.880]  But the alleged drug addict George Michael dies,
[12:44.880 --> 12:46.560]  and it's a global tragedy.
[12:46.560 --> 12:48.560]  Get some frigging perspective.
[12:48.560 --> 12:53.440]  On one day alone, in 1916, nearly 20,000 British soldiers
[12:53.440 --> 12:55.360]  were killed at the Battle of the Somme.
[12:55.360 --> 12:58.640]  On one day, that was a natural tragedy.
[12:58.640 --> 13:01.760]  Yes, it's sad for George Michael and Carrie Fisher's family
[13:01.760 --> 13:03.280]  that they died prematurely.
[13:03.280 --> 13:06.000]  But how does it affect you in any way?
[13:06.000 --> 13:10.080]  Most of the idiot millennials crying over this weren't even born
[13:10.080 --> 13:12.880]  when George Michael and Carrie Fisher were in their heyday.
[13:12.880 --> 13:17.520]  You've been manipulated by celebrity obsessed culture to take it personally.
[13:17.520 --> 13:20.400]  The other reason is that we've allowed society and culture
[13:20.400 --> 13:22.640]  to become completely atomized.
[13:22.640 --> 13:26.800]  Celebrities of the 20th century were universally known and loved,
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.800]  because being a celebrity was something that had to be earned.
[13:30.800 --> 13:31.840]  You might not believe this,
[13:31.840 --> 13:36.240]  but celebrities used to actually have talent to become famous.
[13:36.240 --> 13:39.600]  Now, fame is determined by who can be the most vulgar,
[13:39.600 --> 13:42.960]  who can sell out quickly enough to become the poster child
[13:42.960 --> 13:47.760]  for the next generation of nihilistic, mindless, cultural parasites.
[13:47.760 --> 13:51.600]  The result is that there are more celebrities than ever before
[13:51.600 --> 13:54.960]  with less some talent than ever before.
[13:54.960 --> 13:58.640]  So you're not really mourning the deaths of Prince and George Michael.
[13:58.640 --> 14:03.200]  You're mourning the death of your culture, the death of authenticity.
[14:03.200 --> 14:08.080]  Will anyone mourn the deaths of these idiots in 50 years' time?
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.360]  But who's largely to blame for this 2016 is the worst year ever narrative?
[14:13.360 --> 14:18.800]  You guessed it, the cancerous polyp on the butt of humanity known as BuzzFeed.
[14:18.800 --> 14:22.560]  24 tweets that perfectly sum up how s***y 2016 has been so far.
[14:22.560 --> 14:25.600]  It wasn't just you. Chipotle also had a terrible year.
[14:25.600 --> 14:29.120]  2016 was quite a year. These are the gifts that got us through it.
[14:29.120 --> 14:33.120]  Guys, it's official. 2016 is actually the worst year.
[14:34.880 --> 14:38.720]  No BuzzFeed. Trump's election and Princess Leia dying
[14:38.720 --> 14:42.640]  doesn't compete with global catastrophes, genocide and plague.
[14:42.640 --> 14:44.640]  Maybe if you've been living in Aleppo,
[14:44.640 --> 14:47.760]  in the middle of a civil war for the past 12 months,
[14:47.760 --> 14:51.840]  you could justifiably claim that 2016 was the worst year ever.
[14:51.840 --> 14:54.960]  Sitting in your comfy air-conditioned home on your iPad,
[14:54.960 --> 15:00.240]  reading a BuzzFeed listicle while tutting about Donald Trump, I don't think so.
[15:00.240 --> 15:06.160]  Oh yeah, and I would argue that when it comes to ranking the absolute worst people of 2016,
[15:06.160 --> 15:12.880]  the Orlando nightclub mass-murdering terrorist Omar Mateen is somewhat more worthy of that title
[15:12.880 --> 15:15.520]  than people who you disagree with on the internet.
[15:15.520 --> 15:21.520]  The fact is that too many people care more about celebrities than their own family members.
[15:21.520 --> 15:27.520]  How many of you were more upset over Prince and David Bowie dying than your own grandmother dying?
[15:27.520 --> 15:32.320]  We've been completely disconnected from the people in our immediate life.
[15:32.320 --> 15:36.960]  The ones who should matter most. We've been atomized.
[15:36.960 --> 15:40.480]  No, it's the worst year ever because Trump won.
[15:40.480 --> 15:47.440]  Right, so 100 plus families in Nice and Berlin had their loved ones crushed to death
[15:47.440 --> 15:50.080]  by crazed jihadists driving trucks.
[15:50.080 --> 15:51.920]  And you're still whining about Trump.
[15:51.920 --> 15:55.040]  Your team didn't win an election. Get over it.
[15:55.040 --> 15:59.920]  You're still whining about your parents getting you the wrong colored iPhone for Christmas.
[15:59.920 --> 16:01.680]  Show some gratitude.
[16:01.680 --> 16:05.040]  Your living standard is the highest in human history.
[16:05.040 --> 16:06.720]  You've never had it better.
[16:06.720 --> 16:09.920]  And what about all the good stuff that happened in 2016?
[16:09.920 --> 16:13.040]  We made massive strides in curing Alzheimer's and cancer.
[16:13.040 --> 16:15.200]  Global crime figures continue to come down.
[16:15.200 --> 16:17.680]  Child mortality rates continue to come down.
[16:17.680 --> 16:20.800]  Tiger numbers are recovering. Panda numbers are recovering.
[16:24.640 --> 16:29.680]  Compared to our ancestors, life in 2016 was pretty damn good.
[16:29.680 --> 16:36.640]  So stop trying to out virtue signal each other on social media about how depressed you are over 2016.
[16:36.640 --> 16:40.080]  Stop whining about Donald Trump and dead celebrities.
[16:40.080 --> 16:45.520]  Start living your life with authenticity, reconnecting with the people around you,
[16:45.520 --> 16:49.520]  and making them the center of your universe.
[17:16.320 --> 17:19.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're only 17 days out
[17:20.160 --> 17:23.040]  on our mission impossible to put a pro-America,
[17:24.400 --> 17:29.600]  pro-prosperity president in the White House.
[17:30.240 --> 17:36.160]  And the globalists are amazing, even me, at the depths that they will stoop to in their
[17:36.160 --> 17:41.200]  information war of deception against the American people and the people of the world.
[17:41.200 --> 17:46.160]  Hard to believe we're already two days in two. 2017.
[17:47.440 --> 17:51.200]  It is Monday, January 2nd, 2017.
[17:51.200 --> 17:53.760]  Boy, does that not roll off the tongue.
[17:53.760 --> 18:00.160]  And I'm your host Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[18:01.200 --> 18:04.240]  I have been working on so many big stories behind the scenes.
[18:04.240 --> 18:07.200]  I was up here Saturday, Sunday.
[18:07.200 --> 18:09.200]  I was up here Friday night as well.
[18:09.200 --> 18:15.200]  I have been working so much that I actually got on air 17 minutes late today.
[18:15.200 --> 18:17.200]  But we had great reports to air.
[18:17.200 --> 18:19.200]  And with my son, Rex Jones, doing a great job.
[18:19.200 --> 18:25.200]  And of course, the titan of resisting political correctness, Paul Joseph Watson.
[18:25.200 --> 18:33.200]  What a asset that man is from London, England in the fight to awaken humanity.
[18:33.200 --> 18:37.200]  Reaching tens of millions of people a week alone with his own videos.
[18:37.200 --> 18:40.240]  He files on to mention the articles that go around the world.
[18:40.240 --> 18:42.240]  But then there's Merkel failing and everybody else.
[18:42.240 --> 18:45.200]  Every one of the people here, I can't single one person out.
[18:45.200 --> 18:46.240]  They're all amazing.
[18:46.240 --> 18:50.240]  Merkel failing on Friday.
[18:50.240 --> 18:57.200]  Had the article, Washington Post stirs fears after false report of power grid hack by Russia.
[18:57.200 --> 18:59.200]  And Drudge took our story and posted it.
[18:59.200 --> 19:03.200]  And by the next day, what came out?
[19:03.200 --> 19:07.200]  Well, by the next day, it all came out, didn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
[19:07.200 --> 19:13.200]  Put that story up on screen for TV viewers.
[19:13.200 --> 19:17.200]  They had to admit that it was a hoax story.
[19:17.200 --> 19:19.200]  The Washington Post had to retract.
[19:19.200 --> 19:21.200]  Forbes reported on it, even Politico did.
[19:21.200 --> 19:23.200]  I keep saying this because it's true.
[19:23.200 --> 19:32.200]  The Washington Post is almost as bad as the onion at this point in their desperation to try to brainwash the public.
[19:32.200 --> 19:35.200]  Back under their control.
[19:35.200 --> 19:39.200]  But it hasn't happened yet.
[19:39.200 --> 19:44.200]  So again, it's a very, very exciting time to be alive right now.
[19:44.200 --> 19:50.200]  We're going to look at the next 17 days and the big challenges facing humanity and the fact that it's undoubted.
[19:50.200 --> 19:54.200]  The Democrats are trying to cook up public support.
[19:54.200 --> 20:01.200]  We're going to break down how to try to block President Trump's inauguration in 17 days.
[20:01.200 --> 20:06.200]  In these uncertain times, it makes sense to have a sustainable backup method to cook food and boil water.
[20:06.200 --> 20:12.200]  If your current plan includes using a fuel-burning stove or cooking over an open fire, then there's a much better way.
[20:12.200 --> 20:18.200]  The Minuteman rocket stove is a biomass-burning cooking stove that only requires small quantities of sticks and twigs for fuel.
[20:18.200 --> 20:22.200]  The Minuteman stove is easy to use, smokeless, portable, powerful, and sustainable.
[20:22.200 --> 20:28.200]  For the finest in survival cooking stoves and fire starters made right here in the USA, go to Minutemanstove.com.
[20:28.200 --> 20:31.200]  That's Minutemanstove.com.
[21:01.200 --> 21:04.200]  What looks good under your Christmas tree and tastes even better?
[21:04.200 --> 21:08.200]  Big Berkey water filters. Yes, the gift of clean water.
[21:08.200 --> 21:12.200]  A gift that provides a great foundation for achieving good health in the lives of your loved ones.
[21:12.200 --> 21:20.200]  A big Berkey water filter gives them protection from bacteria, heavy metals, chlorine, fluoride, pesticides, and herbicides, VOCs, and more.
[21:20.200 --> 21:26.200]  And best of all, a big Berkey water filter is a gift that lasts for many years with no additional investment.
[21:26.200 --> 21:35.200]  And that saves time and money in filter replacements that other water filters require, and are even powerful enough to purify treated, untreated, or even stagnant pond water.
[21:35.200 --> 21:42.200]  As always, all orders over $50 are shipped free, and GCN listeners get 5% off all ceramic filter systems.

[21:56.200 --> 22:19.200]  Gift well this Christmas. Give a big Berkey water filter.
[22:30.200 --> 22:38.200]  There is an affordable alternative to the high cost of healthcare that offers freedom from insurance while providing compliance with the Obamacare individual mandate.
[22:38.200 --> 22:44.200]  Imagine having access to quality affordable healthcare that allows you the freedom to choose your doctor and hospital.
[22:44.200 --> 22:50.200]  Members can share up to 100% of necessary medical expenses, including some alternative treatments.

[23:29.200 --> 23:33.200]  Did you know your car can be hacked just like your computer or phone?
[23:33.200 --> 23:38.200]  Hackers can hijack the signal of your own key fob to burglarize your vehicle in seconds.
[23:38.200 --> 23:44.200]  The Black Hole Faraday Key fob bag is a signal and penetrable shield that stops these hacks in their tracks.

[24:01.200 --> 24:08.200]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[24:08.200 --> 24:33.200]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[24:33.200 --> 24:35.200]  Welcome back. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[24:35.200 --> 24:41.200]  Here's the big scoop. The big news affecting the entire world right now if you want to know.
[24:41.200 --> 24:52.200]  And if this information gets out to the world, we may be able to stop the ongoing attempt to block Donald Trump from becoming the 45th president of the United States.
[24:52.200 --> 24:59.200]  Now notice, in everything they do in the PSYOP, they say, we're having a recount.
[24:59.200 --> 25:03.200]  We're going to have the electors try to block Trump so he doesn't become president.
[25:03.200 --> 25:10.200]  And you say that's wrong. You're trying to overthrow the voters' wishes and they say, no one's trying to get rid of Trump.
[25:10.200 --> 25:16.200]  We just simply want to check the integrity of the voting system. Or we just want to check the integrity of the electors.
[25:16.200 --> 25:27.200]  And then a few days before the electors are about to choose, they go public all over the news, all over CNN, all over Fox, all over MSNBC.
[25:27.200 --> 25:34.200]  Hollywood comes out of the woodwork like a bunch of rats. And they say, don't do it. Stand against Trump. Yes.
[25:34.200 --> 25:39.200]  Call for a new election. Block him or vote for Hillary. And that blows up in their face.
[25:39.200 --> 25:44.200]  So the military tactic they're using is they don't want opposition to ever form.
[25:44.200 --> 25:55.200]  So they go out and they organize their movements to don't let him have the votes from the primaries, don't let Sanders have it, deny the whole time you're stealing it, but then steal it.
[25:55.200 --> 26:04.200]  Move on to the next steal. Deny you're trying to have a recount, then have the recount. It fails. Deny you're trying to get electors to flip.
[26:04.200 --> 26:11.200]  Then when they don't flip, flip out and say, you've got to flip. And it's the same thing with this Russia hack bull.
[26:11.200 --> 26:17.200]  They have been running around for over a year before the election even took place saying the Russians are manipulating the election.
[26:17.200 --> 26:20.200]  They're going to steal it. We've got to federalize the election.
[26:20.200 --> 26:32.200]  They're going to be like, hey, it's Homeland Security you got to worry about and Jay Johnson and Loretta Lynch and all these other people that have shown themselves to be absolute criminals in my view,
[26:32.200 --> 26:40.200]  covering up for the Clinton, Zend, Obama and opening our borders, doing everything else. They're going to try to steal the election.
[26:40.200 --> 26:48.200]  Now we have Georgia and five other six states saying Homeland Security hacked their computers on election night and we're trying to flip the votes.
[26:48.200 --> 26:57.200]  In the software, they were trying to steal it that night. Six states. Hillary successfully did steal five others.
[26:57.200 --> 27:07.200]  The numbers are clear. We've had Bev Harris on breaking it down. Some precincts would vote over 100% Hillary. Some precincts at midnight.
[27:07.200 --> 27:14.200]  They would have more votes come in and they'd all be for Hillary. I mean all the classic dead to rights fraud.
[27:14.200 --> 27:19.200]  You can read the articles from again a month ago. Georgia accuses Homeland Security of attempting to hack state's election database,
[27:19.200 --> 27:25.200]  but you actually watched the newscast and talked to the election officials. No, they were in their systems. They just caught them and kicked them out.
[27:25.200 --> 27:35.200]  Six states. Five states joined Georgia. South Carolina, West Virginia, you name it.
[27:35.200 --> 27:43.200]  So they caught them in those key battlegrounds trying to steal it and trying to match up with the fake polls they had saying she was going to carry those states.
[27:43.200 --> 27:48.200]  Oh, the polls are wrong. Yeah, because it was all part of a fraud. Give me the fake poll then stealing.
[27:48.200 --> 27:56.200]  So here's how the system works. Deny there's an attack going on just to divert people from ever forming opposition to it.
[27:56.200 --> 28:04.200]  So now they're saying we don't want to put Trump in. That's a Freudian slip. Here they are saying we're not trying to stop him from getting in.
[28:04.200 --> 28:08.200]  We just want the evidence of the Russian hack to come out. We just want to have an investigation.
[28:08.200 --> 28:14.200]  So they're having the congressional investigations this week. All their own operatives admit they want to get rid of Trump.
[28:14.200 --> 28:26.200]  They want to have hearings. They want to create enough of a public buildup of support for all of this that the public accepts it and goes along with it or at least thinks the rest of the public is going along with it.
[28:26.200 --> 28:35.200]  Remember, the last shoe to drop is that you feel like you're alone. You're awake, but you don't know that everybody else is awake.
[28:35.200 --> 28:45.200]  So they want to make you feel alone and continue to feel like you're alone and continue to be unaware of how big the stakes are that we're fighting for so you never go out and organize.
[28:45.200 --> 28:51.200]  They don't want you to understand you're the majority. They don't want you to have hope. They don't want you to be engaged. They want you to be stunted.
[28:51.200 --> 28:55.200]  They want you to be scared. They want you to be cowed. They want you to be coward.
[28:55.200 --> 29:05.200]  While they build the opposition to Trump and basically claim he's a Russian agent, I've been telling you the next shoe to drop would be that Trump was a Russian agent.
[29:05.200 --> 29:15.200]  The Washington Post came out on Sunday. That's the White House mouthpiece and said, well, he's blowing off this Russian hack. Looks like he's probably a Russian agent.
[29:15.200 --> 29:20.200]  It's worse than we knew. Putin refused to pull his diplomats when we pulled ours.
[29:20.200 --> 29:28.200]  Putin refused to kick out our diplomats when we kicked out there's tit for tat.
[29:28.200 --> 29:32.200]  Putin refused to do anything when we shot down their airplanes. What are we going to do?
[29:32.200 --> 29:40.200]  And so we're now up to this point where they're introducing the idea of how do we block Trump? How do we stop him? And they're going to try again.
[29:40.200 --> 29:50.200]  Now they failed every time. That's the good news. But the big news story is they're trying. This is so epic. This is so historical. This is so over the top. Stay with us.
[30:15.200 --> 30:25.200]  While making a Happy New Year speech addressing his soldiers who are fighting against the pro-Russian People's Republics, he made a baffling statement that put a face of awkward perplexity on his troops.
[30:25.200 --> 30:34.200]  Ukrainian president declared that the Donbass region is under the Ukrainian occupation and that it is only temporary and that Ukraine will surely be united once again.
[30:34.200 --> 30:45.200]  He followed with the popular neo-nazi-colon response motto, saying, Glory to Ukraine, to which the baffled soldiers had to respond with Glory to the heroes after an awkward pause.
[30:45.200 --> 30:52.200]  Naturally, all the printed media had conveniently corrected his speech, replacing Ukrainian occupation with Russian occupation.
[30:52.200 --> 31:00.200]  But alas, the speech was broadcasted live and was seen and heard by millions of people. This has been Daria for Infowars.com.

[33:28.200 --> 33:45.200]  Alright this is really complex but it's also really really simple so let me try again before the break cuts me off to lay this down very succinctly and very calmly but as I talk about it it gets me so upset because we're in the middle of history happening right now and everything we do affects change.
[33:45.200 --> 34:02.200]  The general public's asleep. Most people are on vacation right now. Obama is just butchering what's left of our economy, signing thousands and thousands of pages of documents a day just totally wrecking things and trying to block Trump from even getting into office.
[34:02.200 --> 34:15.200]  They've got the media trying to massage the public but also our military police and courts into accepting an overturn of the 2016 historic election.
[34:15.200 --> 34:32.200]  They've been pushing from the start with the attempts to stop what happened in the primaries that were unprecedented saying your popular vote didn't matter for the unprecedented recounts that only gave Trump more votes, the unprecedented going after the unfaithful electors and now.
[34:32.200 --> 34:47.200]  It is simply mind blowing that they are all over MSM putting out daily hoaxes that when we kicked the Russian diplomats out that Putin kicked US diplomats out including children.
[34:47.200 --> 35:01.200]  None of it was true so Putin invited all of the diplomats children to not only stay but come to the big Christmas tree lighting January 7th that marks the birthday of Jesus Christ in the Orthodox Church.
[35:01.200 --> 35:06.200]  Their Christmas is what two weeks later than ours basically.
[35:06.200 --> 35:13.200]  I talked about this the other day and I saw some comment on YouTube. Alex thinks we're dumb saying Putin invited people to a Christmas tree.
[35:13.200 --> 35:30.200]  That happened last week. Again the invincible ignorance of some of the YouTubers. I've got to really hand it to you sometimes but the Washington Post came out on Friday and they reported that there had been a hack of a Vermont power plant that could have brought down the whole east coast.
[35:30.200 --> 35:36.200]  That it was malicious, an act of war. McCain said it was an act of war.
[35:36.200 --> 35:53.200]  Our writer, Miquel Phelan, simply went and looked up the local story. They admitted they were ordered by Homeland Security all these private power plants and COG facilities, critical infrastructure facilities to scan all their own private laptops and they found some malware that's been connected to Russia in the last year.
[35:53.200 --> 36:01.200]  Well there's malware connected to China and Mexico and the United States and Canada and England. I mean of course.
[36:01.200 --> 36:20.200]  So now we're going to have war because someone's private laptop had malware about scamming you individually. Nothing to do with shutting off power plants like Stuxnet that the United States and Israel loaded onto Iranian laptops which then got into their power plant system and could have caused a meltdown.
[36:20.200 --> 36:42.200]  The real industrial espionage is the CIA and NSA admittedly loading millions of chips manufactured in the U.S. and by U.S. companies in China with backdoor computer algorithms that scan and track everything you're doing and then pack up the information and alert the west to go in and then retrieve it but it gets worse than that.
[36:42.200 --> 36:56.200]  They also have kill switches built into everything to hit one button and basically shut down whenever they want. Now A, I don't trust our government to do that. It's out of control. B, what happens with hackers, third parties and state actors?
[36:56.200 --> 37:10.200]  Discover those systems. It leaves the entire system wide open to catastrophic failure. Why would you build a doomsday machine?
[37:10.200 --> 37:26.200]  And certainly if you're going to build a doomsday machine, you've got to tell the world about it so that people don't start a war that triggers the doomsday machine but instead they put the doomsday machine in, let it proliferate and now it's leaked to the public so everybody basically knows how to get into it.
[37:26.200 --> 37:47.200]  Fabulously, absolutely horrible job, globalist, again. You built an NSA grid to spy on all of us, not thinking your own agencies would discover what evil pedophiles you are and evil murderers you are and evil devil worshipers you are and evil Nazi collaborators you are and every other evil you can imagine.
[37:47.200 --> 37:58.200]  It's a legion of motley scum and you thought that wouldn't backfire on you. So now they've been denying, denying, denying, denying they're trying to overthrow Trump so we never form opposition.
[37:58.200 --> 38:10.200]  Notice that mind game. We're going to overthrow Trump. We need to kill him. We need to stop him. We need to block him. We need to, you know, not letting me see it as president. We need to have the electors say no. We need to have recounts on and on and on and on and on.
[38:10.200 --> 38:25.200]  But that's ridiculous. Nancy Pelosi's daughter said about me on Fox News. It's crazy saying I want to stop Trump from being put into office in some type of coup. Alex Jones is making people death threat me. I'm in danger.
[38:25.200 --> 38:43.200]  And then before that even happened, I was told that there was a Justice Department investigation into me for threats against Nancy Pelosi and her daughter. And sure enough, sure enough, she went on the TV a day later and said I was death threading her basically.
[38:43.200 --> 38:56.200]  They have the Justice Department sitting around constantly trying to figure out how to arrest me, making up crap that I'm violent. You're the ones that start all the wars. You're the ones backing the radical jihadis.
[38:56.200 --> 39:07.200]  You're the people that are the clear and present danger, not me and everybody knows it. I'm an American, red, white and blue. I want prosperity. I want private property. I want religious freedom.
[39:07.200 --> 39:20.200]  I want fast cars and John Wayne and women wearing dresses if they want to. The point is, is I like America. And that's it and you know it.
[39:20.200 --> 39:28.200]  So stop saying I'm a Russian agent. And by the way, people say, oh, you don't like that. It's just hurting you? No, it isn't hurting me. And that's the next point.
[39:28.200 --> 39:39.200]  The globalists have gone insane. They are completely disconnected from reality and don't know that even on the left, all over the Internet, all over newspapers, all over the world, it's like, oh, where's your homework go?
[39:39.200 --> 39:50.200]  Oh, the Russians ate it. Oh, my food was cold today. The Russians did it. Oh, my car had a flat today. It was the Russians. Oh, I bounced a check. It was the Russians. Oh, Hillary fell down again. It's the Russians.
[39:50.200 --> 40:00.200]  Oh, Nancy Pelosi is disconnected from reality. It's the Russians. Oh, they ran another bush like we're idiots. It's the Russians. It's you. We don't like you, Colbert. Colbert.
[40:00.200 --> 40:13.200]  They're looking to cancel the show this year. He is one-tenth of his audience three years ago because people are sick of you. They're sick of being lectured by a fake reporter acting like he's a reporter putting out fake news.
[40:13.200 --> 40:20.200]  But you don't care. You double down. Same thing with the Washington Post and every other major outlet like CNN saying it's an act of war.
[40:20.200 --> 40:31.200]  But even when the Washington Post was forced to retract on Sunday about the power plant story, the Russians trying to shut down a power plant and cause a chain reaction in a new dark age.
[40:31.200 --> 40:41.200]  The CNN was still running it last night and this morning. CNN still and after the latest news of a Russian attack, a state sponsored attack on our power plant.
[40:41.200 --> 40:50.200]  While NATO is admittedly blowing up power plants in eastern Ukraine trying to start a war with Russia. It's ongoing.
[40:50.200 --> 41:00.200]  So CNN is still going with the same BS story days and days and days after it's been discredited. They said they're lying to their dwindling audience.
[41:00.200 --> 41:11.200]  So here's the big story. The New World Order is trying to start a war. They're trying to start a Middle Eastern war. They're trying to start a war with Russia.
[41:11.200 --> 41:25.200]  They're trying to start a diplomatic battle with Putin. They are doing everything they can to try to create a crisis big enough that they can get enough fear into the public and enough hysteria into the public to successfully try to either
[41:25.200 --> 41:42.200]  assassinate Trump or arrest Trump or have hearings where they bring out fake information that's so ridiculous but still so shocking that somehow they can halfway sell the idea of having a paramilitary force swoop down on the secret service
[41:42.200 --> 41:56.200]  and the sheriff's departments in New York or in Florida or even in the White House I guess and arrest President Trump because listen this isn't going to stop once he gets in office in 17 days.
[41:56.200 --> 42:06.200]  This isn't like oh go back to sleep now. It's another Republican established from candidate got in. Time to go sleepy time. This is a total battle for not just America but for the entire world.
[42:06.200 --> 42:18.200]  There is an epic global battle. Ladies and gentlemen I am so frustrated and so flustered and so angry at myself every millisecond right now and do you know why?
[42:18.200 --> 42:33.200]  Because in my gut and intellectually and in my spirit I know we've never been in a more epic over the top incredibly dangerous time for this nation and the world.
[42:33.200 --> 42:44.200]  And most of the people are asleep right now laughing at the Democrats saying oh they already tried five or six big things. It all failed. They called him a racist. They called him all these other things. Now they're calling him a Russian agent.
[42:44.200 --> 42:59.200]  Look how stupid they are. Yes I agree. They're a laughing stock but they're not giving up and as they fail over and over again they're getting more frantic, more hysterical, more crazy, more wild eyed, more dangerous and they're escalating the threat continuum.
[42:59.200 --> 43:14.200]  So in the next 17 days is the maximum danger and if Trump does it instantly clean out the entire top echelons of these intelligence agencies and all these media operatives that are burrowed in, he cannot co-op these snakes.
[43:14.200 --> 43:22.200]  They are not going to work with him just because they're sick of panic and want to be close to power. They are going to continue to attack him because this is spiritual.
[43:22.200 --> 43:33.200]  Look at how Paul Ryan over the weekend commended and praised the Democrats for going after Russia claiming they hacked basically supporting the attack on Trump.
[43:33.200 --> 43:45.200]  I watched Fox News this morning. They were saying the same thing over and over again. Spicer and all these people should be saying Hillary got money from the communist Chinese. Hillary got money from the Saudi Arabians.
[43:45.200 --> 43:57.200]  Here they are bragging. Here are the Federal Election Commission numbers. Hundreds of millions. Don't forget they should be up there on every single channel.
[43:57.200 --> 44:11.200]  Getting into the big hacks that have happened in the last year or so that have come out where the communist Chinese hacked into our systems over and over again.
[44:11.200 --> 44:27.200]  Epic fail how OPM hackers, that's the communist Chinese, tapped the motherload of espionage data and got the data of 14 million people that are either spies of 16 agencies or work for them or connected to them.
[44:27.200 --> 44:39.200]  The entire database of government and spy personnel of the federal and basically state governments to the communist Chinese, the super total complete mass motherload.
[44:39.200 --> 44:54.200]  Their user names, their passcodes in many cases and the government for over a year kept the OPM secret because Obama let it happen, probably did it as part of a globalist sell out to the communist Chinese.
[44:54.200 --> 45:01.200]  We gave them the Panama Canal. We've given them almost all the deep water ports. We've given them 98% of Earth mineral extraction.
[45:01.200 --> 45:10.200]  We gave them as part of the globalist deal control over world manufacturing. The United States and Europe were supposed to have military control.
[45:10.200 --> 45:22.200]  China has now double crossed them four years ago, hence the Pacific pivot from the center of US military force, meaning in the grand chessboard, the Middle East, Eastern and Western Europe.
[45:22.200 --> 45:32.200]  The pivot to Asia is because the communist chai comms, drunk on the blood of their innocent people, double crossed their demon creators.
[45:32.200 --> 45:36.200]  The globalist put them in power and said we're not going to follow that.
[45:36.200 --> 45:56.200]  So remember, you got almost no attention a year ago, that a year before that, at least, the entire US government, if you believe it, had all of its data and agents and spies and assets and minions rolled up, rolled up.
[45:56.200 --> 46:03.200]  That wasn't done on purpose. You've never put all that data together. Hillary had her server on purpose in a bathroom and it was well known it was hacked for years.
[46:03.200 --> 46:08.200]  She would put data on there to then be paid at her foundation and her drop box.
[46:08.200 --> 46:14.200]  She didn't go to a local park and drop the stuff underneath a park bench like other spies have done.
[46:14.200 --> 46:23.200]  She would load it up for everybody in the world to see and she would say where she stood on China or where she stood on this country or that and what she was going to do.
[46:23.200 --> 46:30.200]  So they knew what she was about to do and had to give her more money or she would put in policies that weren't one sided for them.
[46:30.200 --> 46:40.200]  Hillary created a digital drop box and by the way, that's been confirmed and that's the data that's going to come out if the Democrats keep pushing.
[46:40.200 --> 46:45.200]  If the Democrats are so crazy, they don't even care. They're going to go for broke.
[46:45.200 --> 46:56.200]  They made a deal with Trump on election night to admit he won and to back off and that then Trump would put out the word to the dogs in US intelligence to stop releasing info.
[46:56.200 --> 47:05.200]  And they began double crossing Trump the next morning and the American people and I told Trump they're never going to stop coming after you.
[47:05.200 --> 47:13.200]  I told him three days after the election, I said, Mr. President-elect, they're never going to stop. They're never going to follow the deal.
[47:13.200 --> 47:19.200]  They're going to try to kill you politically or physically. They're not going to stop.
[47:19.200 --> 47:26.200]  They can't stay. I'm not going to say everything I said and I've said or what Trump said.
[47:26.200 --> 47:37.200]  But let me explain something to everybody. This is deadly serious. All of this is deadly serious.
[47:37.200 --> 47:47.200]  You think they might be going for broke when the Washington Post calls for war and the New York Times calls for war and CNN calls for war saying the Russians tried to turn the power off on Christmas.
[47:47.200 --> 47:54.200]  And it's a made up story and they know it's made up. You think they're going to quit now? You think they're going to quit now when they've already pulled out all the stops?
[47:54.200 --> 48:07.200]  The type of people they are is that they would turn loose millions of radical jihadis out of the entire planet from Afghanistan and Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and Qatar
[48:07.200 --> 48:23.200]  and from Chechnya and all over to invade Syria five years ago at an uprising, an invasion, a jihad invasion, just like the House of Saud invasions that have happened previously two times before from 1903 to 1933.
[48:23.200 --> 48:32.200]  And they went in there and they kill every Christian and every Alawite and every Shiite they get their stinking hands on and our media praises it and says it's good.
[48:32.200 --> 48:37.200]  That's who runs our government right now and they thought they were going to keep this country down.
[48:37.200 --> 48:51.200]  They thought they were going to finish the nation and put in five Supreme Court justices and got us for good and raise our taxes into the stratosphere while they exempt themselves and destroy the republic once and for all and establish their world government.
[48:51.200 --> 48:54.200]  Right when they thought they had it.
[48:54.200 --> 49:02.200]  The populist movement went into turbo charge, you did your job, we did our jobs, we spread the word, we prepared the minds for the truth.
[49:02.200 --> 49:10.200]  And intelligence agencies who've been waiting for the opening forever to fight back as soon as the public stood up and as soon as the public was informed and we did our job.
[49:10.200 --> 49:26.200]  The intelligence agencies leaked all the info from England to Spain to Australia to the United States to blow their system worldwide and we're in the middle of a war for national sovereignty and human self determination, the likes of which the world's never seen.
[49:26.200 --> 49:28.200]  But they're never going to tell you it's historic.
[49:28.200 --> 49:32.200]  I noticed what they're afraid of by the bots and hired minions.
[49:32.200 --> 49:35.200]  They admit they have hired to go after us like no one else.
[49:35.200 --> 49:41.200]  On Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, on Google, on Info Wars when they attack us on our own platform.
[49:41.200 --> 49:43.200]  I'm going to skip this break, this is so important.
[49:43.200 --> 49:52.200]  They attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and they attack and what do they say?
[49:52.200 --> 49:54.200]  You're a kook and nobody Alex.
[49:54.200 --> 49:56.200]  Nobody listens to you or your listeners.
[49:56.200 --> 49:57.200]  You're a nobody.
[49:57.200 --> 49:58.200]  You're going to fail.
[49:58.200 --> 49:59.200]  We're going to kill Trump.
[49:59.200 --> 50:00.200]  We're going to get you.
[50:00.200 --> 50:03.200]  We can follow these bots back to like big servers that are blocking identities.
[50:03.200 --> 50:05.200]  The feds are trying to find out.
[50:05.200 --> 50:06.200]  The police are trying to get on them.
[50:06.200 --> 50:08.200]  And that's why they know it's state sponsored.
[50:08.200 --> 50:09.200]  We're going to get you.
[50:09.200 --> 50:11.200]  We're going to get your family, all this stuff.
[50:11.200 --> 50:13.200]  And then they expand out from there.
[50:13.200 --> 50:15.200]  And what do they say?
[50:15.200 --> 50:17.200]  And what do they do?
[50:17.200 --> 50:20.200]  They say stop saying your broadcast is historic.
[50:20.200 --> 50:22.200]  Stop saying Drudge is historic.
[50:22.200 --> 50:24.200]  And stop saying Donald Trump's election was historic.
[50:24.200 --> 50:25.200]  You know it's not.
[50:25.200 --> 50:26.200]  Of course it's historic.
[50:26.200 --> 50:28.200]  It's the biggest thing ever.
[50:28.200 --> 50:33.200]  But they keep telling you we're not trying to overthrow Trump.
[50:33.200 --> 50:34.200]  You're a kook.
[50:34.200 --> 50:35.200]  Don't organize anything against it.
[50:35.200 --> 50:36.200]  You don't have any power.
[50:36.200 --> 50:37.200]  You can't affect any change.
[50:37.200 --> 50:39.200]  Roll over in the ditch and die.
[50:39.200 --> 50:44.200]  It's classic military Psyop by globalists that demoralize us.
[50:44.200 --> 50:46.200]  But here's the good news.
[50:46.200 --> 50:49.200]  Our military knows the Psyop when they see one.
[50:49.200 --> 50:50.200]  They see the war against America.
[50:50.200 --> 50:53.200]  And our military is almost completely away.
[50:53.200 --> 50:57.200]  The globalists are so disconnected that 20 years ago they told the Marines and then
[50:57.200 --> 51:02.200]  the Army don't visit Info Wars and don't watch Alex Jones's films.
[51:02.200 --> 51:04.200]  What do you think happened?
[51:04.200 --> 51:06.200]  My audience doubled in a month.
[51:06.200 --> 51:08.200]  I mean I wasn't that big 20 years ago.
[51:08.200 --> 51:12.200]  Sure I might have had a million listeners a week maximum.
[51:12.200 --> 51:16.200]  Maybe.
[51:16.200 --> 51:19.200]  And suddenly it was like three, four million.
[51:19.200 --> 51:22.200]  And it was all military all of a sudden.
[51:22.200 --> 51:26.200]  And then I've always asked if somebody in there get authorization to do that.
[51:26.200 --> 51:31.200]  Your higher ups were dumb and would say, yeah, yeah, ban Alex Jones to like give us our original audience
[51:31.200 --> 51:34.200]  that pushed us over the top and made us the success we are.
[51:34.200 --> 51:37.200]  But now doesn't Hillary know when she attacks me?
[51:37.200 --> 51:45.200]  And when they say I'm all these bad things and lie about me and have all their paid shills put out all this info.
[51:45.200 --> 51:48.200]  Don't they know that only makes everybody tune in more?
[51:48.200 --> 51:50.200]  And I don't even mean the general public.
[51:50.200 --> 51:52.200]  The general public is important and there's someone awake now.
[51:52.200 --> 52:00.200]  But the people that do the hanging, the military, the police, the bureaucrats, the judges, the lawyers, the congress people,
[52:00.200 --> 52:01.200]  they all listen.
[52:01.200 --> 52:03.200]  The Russian government listens.
[52:03.200 --> 52:04.200]  The British government listens.
[52:04.200 --> 52:06.200]  The Israeli government listens.
[52:06.200 --> 52:08.200]  The Pakistani government listens.
[52:08.200 --> 52:09.200]  The Japanese government listens.
[52:09.200 --> 52:13.200]  The Communist Chinese listen and hate my guts.
[52:13.200 --> 52:16.200]  Because they know folks this is the real place.
[52:16.200 --> 52:21.200]  I don't want to differentiate myself and say this is the only place you really get information of this magnitude.
[52:21.200 --> 52:27.200]  It's the only place you get it, this strong, this focused, this dedicated, this continual.
[52:27.200 --> 52:29.200]  We don't take breaks around here.
[52:29.200 --> 52:32.200]  I don't.
[52:32.200 --> 52:34.200]  Because history is happening now.
[52:34.200 --> 52:37.200]  And so here's the bottom line encapsulated.
[52:37.200 --> 52:43.200]  There is an active ongoing program to overthrow Donald Trump.
[52:43.200 --> 52:50.200]  There is an active program worldwide to stop nationalism and to defeat it using racial divides within nation states.
[52:50.200 --> 52:56.200]  They don't want to unify around nationalism and around prosperity and around Americana and free market and renaissance.
[52:56.200 --> 53:01.200]  So they sell communism, socialism, racial division, cultural and religious strife.
[53:01.200 --> 53:05.200]  It's why they bring in incompatible Muslims to create the crisis.
[53:05.200 --> 53:06.200]  And it's in all their white papers.
[53:06.200 --> 53:07.200]  It's in all their admissions.
[53:07.200 --> 53:10.200]  It's in George Soros' article he wrote about Trump last week.
[53:10.200 --> 53:12.200]  It's in the Financial Times of London.
[53:12.200 --> 53:13.200]  It's in the Economist.
[53:13.200 --> 53:14.200]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[53:14.200 --> 53:19.200]  They aren't even hiding their program.
[53:19.200 --> 53:22.200]  Because they're not targeting thinking people now.
[53:22.200 --> 53:27.200]  They have made a pure decision to dumb the message down and say the Russians just hacked us.
[53:27.200 --> 53:28.200]  The lights went out.
[53:28.200 --> 53:29.200]  Newcombe.
[53:29.200 --> 53:30.200]  The Russians just expelled all their diplomats.
[53:30.200 --> 53:31.200]  We didn't do it.
[53:31.200 --> 53:32.200]  They did it.
[53:32.200 --> 53:33.200]  Newcombe.
[53:33.200 --> 53:34.200]  The Russians are attacking Ukraine.
[53:34.200 --> 53:35.200]  Newcombe.
[53:35.200 --> 53:36.200]  The Russians are behind ISIS.
[53:36.200 --> 53:38.200]  Newcombe.
[53:38.200 --> 53:41.200]  It's all 180 inversion.
[53:41.200 --> 53:43.200]  And so here's the big news flash.
[53:43.200 --> 53:47.200]  They have got an active program in place to overthrow Trump.
[53:47.200 --> 53:49.200]  You already know that.
[53:49.200 --> 53:53.200]  And they're escalating it every day.
[53:53.200 --> 53:57.200]  The only publication I've seen in the United States that is establishment that has said
[53:57.200 --> 54:02.200]  this is all pure bull is Matt Taibbi at Rolling Stone.
[54:02.200 --> 54:06.200]  Which is bizarre because Matt Taibbi will put out the biggest bull about me and tweets
[54:06.200 --> 54:12.200]  and stuff that is totally made up crap.
[54:12.200 --> 54:16.200]  And then he'll put out stories that are basically true.
[54:16.200 --> 54:19.200]  And thought provoking and penetrating and well researched.
[54:19.200 --> 54:22.200]  You know, Psyhurst doesn't say mean things about me.
[54:22.200 --> 54:24.200]  Matt Taibbi, he's a bigger journalist than you.
[54:24.200 --> 54:27.200]  He's won Pulitzer Prize and all the others.
[54:27.200 --> 54:30.200]  And he just called us and said, I want to come on and thank your listeners in the intelligence
[54:30.200 --> 54:34.200]  community and the patriots that expose that our government's been working secretly with
[54:34.200 --> 54:37.200]  the Russians for four years to block Obama and the globalist.
[54:37.200 --> 54:42.200]  Because our government decided the globalist and George Soros are not the legitimate U.S.
[54:42.200 --> 54:43.200]  government.
[54:43.200 --> 54:48.200]  Now how epic is that? And there were no news articles about Psyhurst coming on to say your
[54:48.200 --> 54:53.200]  analysis for four years about Syria has been spot on and on target.
[54:53.200 --> 54:57.200]  And I want to thank all the good people in our military and the foreign Russian military
[54:57.200 --> 55:00.200]  that worked together to block this.
[55:00.200 --> 55:02.200]  Military to military is the book.
[55:02.200 --> 55:05.200]  The way he writes about it.
[55:05.200 --> 55:10.200]  And I had Colonel Shaffer on five years ago saying our military knows all the rebels are
[55:10.200 --> 55:14.200]  the hottest out of Saudi Arabia running and we're blocking it now with members of Congress
[55:14.200 --> 55:18.200]  that have agreed that if Obama tries to block us, we're going to bring all this information out.
[55:18.200 --> 55:23.200]  And so Obama backed off and had to sit there and watch the huge ISIS military get its ass
[55:23.200 --> 55:25.200]  kicked all over the planet.
[55:25.200 --> 55:28.200]  Now again, how epic is that?
[55:28.200 --> 55:35.200]  There is a civil war going on in America with our intelligence agencies working with Russia
[55:35.200 --> 55:41.200]  because they couldn't get Obama to let them launch military attacks and actually take out Al Qaeda and ISIS
[55:41.200 --> 55:45.200]  show they began to just give the Russians the information.
[55:45.200 --> 55:47.200]  Think about how historical that is.
[55:47.200 --> 55:49.200]  Think about how giant that is.
[55:49.200 --> 55:50.200]  Think about how big that is.
[55:50.200 --> 55:57.200]  And now the very illegitimate outside force that hijacked our country is telling us we need war with Russia.
[55:57.200 --> 55:58.200]  That's the headline.
[55:58.200 --> 56:00.200]  McCain says it's an act of war with Russia.
[56:00.200 --> 56:02.200]  We must respond.
[56:02.200 --> 56:07.200]  No retraction to the fake story about them hacking our power plants.
[56:07.200 --> 56:09.200]  And I've been saying this for months.
[56:09.200 --> 56:13.200]  Obama might turn the power off before the election and claim the Russians did it.
[56:13.200 --> 56:14.200]  And I don't even have the staff.
[56:14.200 --> 56:17.200]  This place has like eight people here right now instead of 60.
[56:17.200 --> 56:18.200]  We're in a skeleton crew right now.
[56:18.200 --> 56:23.200]  I know I've said that the last two months probably 50 times that I would look for a false flag on the power grid.
[56:23.200 --> 56:31.200]  Hell, we had bracket on last week saying look for a power attack on the grid to be blamed on Russia.
[56:31.200 --> 56:35.200]  So that Obama can stay in office during a national emergency.
[56:35.200 --> 56:38.200]  And Bracken said it the week before and the week before.
[56:38.200 --> 56:41.200]  So listen listeners, you understand we're in this war together.
[56:41.200 --> 56:45.200]  When I say you're the info war, I'm not just saying that to make you feel good and patch on the head.
[56:45.200 --> 56:48.200]  I need you to get out there and get all the places we predicted it.
[56:48.200 --> 56:51.200]  Because the sheeple don't listen to me when I'm saying it today.
[56:51.200 --> 56:55.200]  They listen when I say it over and over and over and over again before.
[56:55.200 --> 57:02.200]  Matt Bracken, the waves are coming jihad grid down collapse citizen disarmament.
[57:02.200 --> 57:03.200]  Yeah, that's back in May.
[57:03.200 --> 57:11.200]  I'm saying and he said last Thursday, he said, I think Obama will try a grid down shutdown.
[57:11.200 --> 57:15.200]  The next day they come out and announce it as a beta test to see if we'll buy it.
[57:15.200 --> 57:18.200]  Oh, the Russians are trying to shut the East Coast power grid off.
[57:18.200 --> 57:23.200]  You imagine if the East Coast power grid goes off, the globalist can flip two switches.
[57:23.200 --> 57:25.200]  Two, two.
[57:25.200 --> 57:30.200]  The authorization switch and then the switch the program to bring the power grid down to switches.
[57:30.200 --> 57:38.200]  One phone call, two switches and the entire East Coast power grid goes off.
[57:38.200 --> 57:40.200]  Bracken said what they did.
[57:40.200 --> 57:41.200]  What's the Pentagon tell me?
[57:41.200 --> 57:42.200]  They go, we're not going to take anything classified.
[57:42.200 --> 57:43.200]  Get Matt Bracken on.
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.200]  He's got to figure it out.
[57:44.200 --> 57:45.200]  We get him on.
[57:45.200 --> 57:47.200]  He says they're going to turn the power off.
[57:47.200 --> 57:49.200]  You understand that's how you get information is classified.
[57:49.200 --> 57:52.200]  They'll sit there and look at who's already figured it out.
[57:52.200 --> 57:53.200]  You want to talk to that guy?
[57:53.200 --> 57:54.200]  Nobody told Bracken anything.
[57:54.200 --> 57:56.200]  Bracken sitting there in his house, 18 hours a day, figured it out.
[57:56.200 --> 58:00.200]  He was counterterrorism, Navy SEAL, land-destined operations all over the world.
[58:00.200 --> 58:01.200]  He's figured it out.
[58:01.200 --> 58:04.200]  In fact, let's get Matt Bracken on today.
[58:04.200 --> 58:07.200]  Yeah, they found this six months ago saying it.
[58:07.200 --> 58:11.200]  But he said last week and the week before, he said, I said, what type of false flag?
[58:11.200 --> 58:16.200]  He said, I would look for a grid down East Coast.
[58:16.200 --> 58:17.200]  Think we're playing around here?
[58:17.200 --> 58:18.200]  Now I skipped the break.
[58:18.200 --> 58:19.200]  It didn't even plug.
[58:19.200 --> 58:23.200]  We're extending because people really like it and we've sold out of half of our
[58:23.200 --> 58:24.200] aceuticals.
[58:24.200 --> 58:26.200]  We've got a lot of the other high quality stuff still there.
[58:26.200 --> 58:27.200]  Supermell is about to sell out.
[58:27.200 --> 58:28.200]  X2 is about to sell out.
[58:28.200 --> 58:29.200]  A lot of stuff sold out.
[58:29.200 --> 58:30.200]  Thanks for the support.
[58:30.200 --> 58:31.200]  We're extending it three more days.
[58:31.200 --> 58:33.200]  It will end Wednesday.
[58:33.200 --> 58:35.200]  And they're store-wide free shipping.
[58:35.200 --> 58:55.200]  We have the new product at m4slife.com, bio true selenium.
[58:55.200 --> 59:00.200]  We've had so many requests over the years for selenium and just recently we were able
[59:00.200 --> 59:06.200]  to source a certified organic bioavailable selenium from mustard seed extract.
[59:06.200 --> 59:11.200]  When you take selenium in the body, it actually benefits the detoxification systems in your
[59:11.200 --> 59:12.200]  body.
[59:12.200 --> 59:16.200]  It helps balance the thyroid gland, it helps detoxify.
[59:16.200 --> 59:18.200]  Selenium is another one of those absolute must-haves.
[59:18.200 --> 59:22.640]  The highest concentration of selenium is in the thyroid gland, but it's actually used
[59:22.640 --> 59:28.520]  all over the body as a matter of fact, there's 25 genes in the body that are directly dependent
[59:28.520 --> 59:35.000]  upon selenium, so it really is a all-around nutrient that everybody really needs.
[59:35.000 --> 59:36.800]  I'm taking it now every day.
[59:36.800 --> 59:39.160]  This is Shoky Bio True.
[59:39.160 --> 59:42.040]  Selenium is the product, the best selenium that we could bring you.
[59:42.040 --> 59:46.680]  We believe it's the best out there at a very, very low price, exclusively available at m4slife.com
[59:46.680 --> 1:00:15.320]  or by calling toll-free, triple-eight, two-five, three-three, one-three-nine.
[1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:30.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:30.320 --> 1:00:37.360]  Deliciousware, malware, my Texas drawl, I twist everything, turn it into malware, was found
[1:00:37.360 --> 1:00:42.080]  on some laptop in Vermont, so the media ran the hoax at the Russians at the power group
[1:00:42.080 --> 1:00:45.800]  trying to take it down, now we're just sitting here thinking, oh wait a minute, every time
[1:00:45.800 --> 1:00:48.800]  Matt Bracken comes on the last month or so, he says they're going to try a false flag,
[1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:54.440]  he thinks, probably a grid down scenario to disrupt the inauguration, that's why Soros
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:01:01.160]  has doubled the amount of money to the burned down America crowd, kill the cop crowd.
[1:01:01.160 --> 1:01:06.960]  So I went open the phones up to police, former, current military, you name it, I just thought
[1:01:06.960 --> 1:01:09.720]  we ought to get Matt Bracken just to host the fourth hour today, I was going to host
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:13.160]  all four hours, why not just give Matt Bracken an hour, that way he doesn't get interrupted
[1:01:13.160 --> 1:01:19.400]  too much here on the first weekday show of 2017, but listeners, we need you to go into
[1:01:19.400 --> 1:01:22.960]  these predictions, you know, we're just last week, Bracken's like, I think they'll do a
[1:01:22.960 --> 1:01:28.440]  grid down power situation before Obama gets here and I'd be watching for that, and then
[1:01:28.440 --> 1:01:32.160]  sure enough, 24 hours later they're like, the Russians are having the power grid, we're
[1:01:32.160 --> 1:01:37.680]  all dead, we need war, McCain's like, to the parapets, get the nukes ready, all because
[1:01:37.680 --> 1:01:42.600]  they want to stop Trump, who they claim is so dangerous and so evil, no, you've hijacked
[1:01:42.600 --> 1:01:48.080]  the country, people are aware of it, people are sick of it.
[1:01:48.080 --> 1:01:52.880]  So they really are planning to try to block Trump and every time they fail, they escalate
[1:01:52.880 --> 1:01:56.880]  the level of crisis they're pushing to get it done.
[1:01:56.880 --> 1:02:00.920]  What do you think these hysterics are going to do to try to stay in power?
[1:02:00.920 --> 1:02:05.840]  First time callers from around the world, overseas, you name it, people agree, people
[1:02:05.840 --> 1:02:09.960]  disagree, military, police particularly, I'll put you to have a line, what do you make of
[1:02:09.960 --> 1:02:15.280]  all this, what do you make about the preparations for all sorts of crises in 17 days, all sorts
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:19.600]  of drills of emergency relocating Trump, no, he's got a lot of top people around him that
[1:02:19.600 --> 1:02:23.240]  understand exactly what's happening, because I've talked to some of them, it's going to
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:28.760]  leave it at that, but the listeners, myself included, I should be doing more, I should
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:35.360]  be more convincing, and I know I'm convincing, I just...
[1:02:35.360 --> 1:02:41.600]  This is so historical that let's say a nuclear war was breaking out with Russia and they
[1:02:41.600 --> 1:02:48.280]  just fired ICBMs in 1967, I would expect Walter Cronkite to be desperate and say, everybody,
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:52.280]  get to your bunkers, the missiles will be here in five minutes, I mean, it's almost
[1:02:52.280 --> 1:02:58.480]  to that level now, the urgency of repudiating Obama, repudiating the globalist, repudiating
[1:02:58.480 --> 1:03:05.280]  George Soros, repudiating Henry Kissinger, and all of these insane, out of control, anti-American
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:09.880]  people who just want to destroy prosperity, to consolidate control, and are willing to
[1:03:09.880 --> 1:03:16.040]  push us into World War III to maintain their control, at a certain point, you want to arrest
[1:03:16.040 --> 1:03:20.280]  the independent press, you want people to come after me, you want to go after all of
[1:03:20.280 --> 1:03:24.720]  our freedoms, you want to be able to do all these horrible things, and then you just think
[1:03:24.720 --> 1:03:29.240]  we're going to sit here and take it, and take it, and take it, and take it, and take it,
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:33.800]  and take it, and take it, and take it, and take it, and take it, and take it, and take
[1:03:33.800 --> 1:03:37.680]  it, and take it, and take it, and take it, and we're not going to take it, and take it,
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:43.040]  and take it, you dumbasses, you keep escalating, you're going to get hurt, and believe me,
[1:03:43.040 --> 1:03:46.840]  you don't mean anything to me, so I don't even want to see you hurt, like seeing a dead
[1:03:46.840 --> 1:03:51.240]  rotting horse or something in the road, I'm only going to look at you, bad with all bright
[1:03:51.240 --> 1:03:55.800]  and all you people, the hell's your problem, you're a bunch of sick freaks, a bunch of
[1:03:55.800 --> 1:03:59.880]  new rottics, want to run everything, want to control everybody, you can't stand people
[1:03:59.880 --> 1:04:03.120]  that are better looking than you, you can't stand people that are stronger than you, you've
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:08.440]  got some weird twisted competitiveness in you, just like they say in the great book
[1:04:08.440 --> 1:04:11.840]  they turn into a film that will be blood, he goes, I have a competitiveness about me,
[1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:17.880]  I don't want anybody else to succeed, I don't want anybody to succeed at my expense walking
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:23.520]  on me, but if you innovate, I'm only going to try to model myself after you, and I'm
[1:04:23.520 --> 1:04:30.960]  going to admire you, I mean I've literally pulled up by somebody's sports car before,
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:35.880]  it's super awesome, and my car is parked next to it and it's nice, that is an incredible
[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.000]  car, they're like, oh man, sorry, sorry, it's better than yours, that's like, no, no,
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  literally, I don't care that your car is so cool, looks like a spaceship, you know, personally
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.440]  I wouldn't drive a car like that because it draws too much attention, but man, that's
[1:04:47.440 --> 1:04:51.960]  really a piece of art, you know, incredible, you know, it's like people don't get it,
[1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:56.800]  you know, competitiveness means you like the competition, it's not that you don't
[1:04:56.800 --> 1:05:00.840]  like people that are successful, but that's who the global star is.
[1:05:00.840 --> 1:05:06.240]  On New Year's Day in Kiev there was a torchlight procession, the Ukrainian neo-Nazis were marching
[1:05:06.240 --> 1:05:10.520]  through the center of the capitol celebrating the birthday of Stepan Bandera, the leader
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:14.600]  of the Ukrainian insurgent army, who was also Nazi sympathizer and a collaborator during
[1:05:14.600 --> 1:05:19.440]  World War II, all the more reasons to be hailed as hero by the Maidan government, the followers
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:23.840]  of Bandera proudly promoting Nazi slogans and the symbolics of the Third Reich, hence
[1:05:23.840 --> 1:05:27.800]  their love for torchlight processions, which were especially popular in Hitler's Germany.
[1:05:27.800 --> 1:05:32.520]  The present-day admirers of Bandera are deeply misled, they glorify the myths given to them,
[1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:36.120]  conveniently ignoring the facts of history, repeated in present-day Ukraine.
[1:05:36.120 --> 1:05:40.120]  They murder their own countrymen under the guise of liberation of the people, they murder
[1:05:40.120 --> 1:05:43.480]  their own ideological supporters who happen to choose a different leader, and they call
[1:05:43.480 --> 1:05:47.760]  it fighting for their country's independence, they murder and betray each other under the
[1:05:47.760 --> 1:05:52.280]  guise of unity and brotherhood, well let's call it for what it is, betrayal, betrayal
[1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:57.080]  of your people and your country, and the enemy within is more dangerous than any outside
[1:05:57.080 --> 1:05:58.080]  threat.
[1:05:58.080 --> 1:06:00.760]  This has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[1:06:00.760 --> 1:06:06.000]  All across the western world, MSM is attempting to demonize the language and words we use,
[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:10.520]  saying, don't say Merry Christmas, use holidays, and now they say don't use holiday, oh I got
[1:06:10.520 --> 1:06:11.520]  some news for them.
[1:06:11.520 --> 1:06:15.800]  We're going to continue to use the speech we feel like using, and we're going to exercise

[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:50.320]  this is a sure win.

[1:08:02.440 --> 1:08:04.040]  SAC, this is Crystal Palace.
[1:08:04.040 --> 1:08:07.920]  SyncnoRat has declared DEF CON 3, scramble all alert aircraft.
[1:08:07.920 --> 1:08:11.440]  I repeat, scramble all alert aircraft.
[1:08:11.440 --> 1:08:16.320]  The whopper spends all its time thinking about World War II.
[1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:19.560]  Target selection complete, time on target sequence complete.
[1:08:19.560 --> 1:08:27.840]  22 Typhoon class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning south out of Nordkjav, bearing 095 degrees.
[1:08:27.840 --> 1:08:32.520]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are going to turn into Alaska near Defense Road.
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:38.280]  From the front lines of the information war, flush the bombers, get the subs in launch
[1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.600]  mode, we are at DEF CON 1.
[1:08:40.600 --> 1:08:45.080]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[1:08:45.080 --> 1:08:46.080]  You bet!
[1:08:46.080 --> 1:08:50.360]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[1:08:50.360 --> 1:08:54.000]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:58.640]  Three, two, one, impact.
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:00.800]  Shall we play a game?
[1:09:00.800 --> 1:09:06.640]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:11.560]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:09:11.560 --> 1:09:15.440]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready, awaiting launch codes.
[1:09:15.440 --> 1:09:17.080]  We are in a launch mode.
[1:09:17.080 --> 1:09:21.000]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:25.320]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:09:25.320 --> 1:09:26.840]  We're in!
[1:09:26.840 --> 1:09:28.600]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[1:09:28.600 --> 1:09:31.120]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[1:09:31.120 --> 1:09:33.160]  I wish I didn't know about any of this.
[1:09:33.160 --> 1:09:35.160]  I wish I was like everybody else.
[1:09:35.160 --> 1:09:49.320]  From the front lines of the information war, okay, so there is a multinational banking
[1:09:49.320 --> 1:09:54.680]  cartel that has established the skeletal workings and is now putting in the organs, the sinew,
[1:09:54.680 --> 1:10:00.760]  the muscle, the brains of a planetary system, a planetary government.
[1:10:00.760 --> 1:10:06.680]  It's very authoritarian, anti-free market, extremely technocratic and draconian in their
[1:10:06.680 --> 1:10:09.000]  own words.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:15.280]  And so they're pulling out every stop they've got to try to keep Trump from getting in, from
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:16.280]  starting wars.
[1:10:16.280 --> 1:10:18.280]  They're claiming he's a Russian agent.
[1:10:18.280 --> 1:10:24.000]  To preparing the public's mind to the fact that there's going to be a power outage taking
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:31.240]  place on the east coast, and that when that does happen, it's the Russians that are behind
[1:10:31.240 --> 1:10:32.240]  it.
[1:10:32.240 --> 1:10:35.600]  Clearly the fake story put out on Friday by the Washington Post that the Russians had
[1:10:35.600 --> 1:10:41.960]  tried to bring down the east coast grid starting in Vermont is to prepare the mind for that.
[1:10:41.960 --> 1:10:48.400]  Matt Bracken, former Navy SEAL author, researcher, journalist, joined us last week to predict
[1:10:48.400 --> 1:10:51.240]  this would be the type of false flag they would run.
[1:10:51.240 --> 1:10:56.040]  He joins us at the bottom of the next hour and will be hosting himself the fourth hour
[1:10:56.040 --> 1:10:57.760]  via Skype.
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:10:58.760]  Now this just broke.
[1:10:58.760 --> 1:11:01.080]  It's up on infowars.com.
[1:11:01.080 --> 1:11:03.080]  It's up on drudgerport.com.
[1:11:03.080 --> 1:11:13.120]  Obama still could force Merrick Garland onto the court during intersession recess.
[1:11:13.120 --> 1:11:18.280]  So no president's ever done stuff like this, but they're talking about with 17 days left
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:26.280]  trying to force a new individual onto the Supreme Court to create a giant train wreck.
[1:11:26.280 --> 1:11:32.720]  Well, I tell you, I'd sure love to see Judge Andrew Napolitano be nominated, and I'd like
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:39.360]  to hear Trump come out, and if not Napolitano, say, hey, here's a few of the judges I think
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:44.160]  are best, and the American people have spoken, they've repudiated you, 900 house seats lost
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:47.520]  in the states, a whole bunch of seats lost in the Senate and the House, a whole bunch
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:53.680]  of governors lost, the people don't want your system, you don't have a mandate.
[1:11:53.680 --> 1:12:01.160]  And so I am nominating, so everybody knows who I'm going to officially nominate in 17
[1:12:01.160 --> 1:12:07.720]  days, who I think should be on the court, and I think Congress should reject this individual
[1:12:07.720 --> 1:12:10.800]  Obama is trying to put on.
[1:12:10.800 --> 1:12:15.000]  President Obama will have one last chance to force Judge Merrick Garland onto the US
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:22.160]  Supreme Court tomorrow, but it's a legal gamble, and one that has so many pitfalls that even
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:26.080]  those who say you could get away with it, believe it isn't worth the fight.
[1:12:26.080 --> 1:12:31.040]  Mr. Obama's moment will come just for noon in the five minutes that the Senate gables
[1:12:31.040 --> 1:12:36.960]  the 114th Congress out of session, and the time for the 115th Congress begins, so you
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:44.040]  have to block the new Congress beginning, and try to extend 2016 via a time warp into
[1:12:44.040 --> 1:12:45.040]  the future.
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:47.480]  And see, with 17 days left, you're going to see more crazy stuff every day.
[1:12:47.480 --> 1:12:50.840]  It's going to be a roller coaster every day, and then when Trump gets in, it'll get even
[1:12:50.840 --> 1:12:56.440]  crazier, because this is a real war for America, and a war for England, and a war for Europe,
[1:12:56.440 --> 1:13:00.000]  and a war for Russia, and a war for sovereignty worldwide.
[1:13:00.000 --> 1:13:02.400]  It's going to get crazy.
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:06.360]  We'll be lucky if there isn't a nuclear war in the next few years.
[1:13:06.360 --> 1:13:12.480]  The globalists are pulling out every stop.
[1:13:12.480 --> 1:13:16.640]  In most few moments, the Senate will go into what's known as the intercession recess, creating
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:20.920]  one golden moment when the president could test his recess appointment powers by sending
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:22.720]  Judge Garland to the high court.
[1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:27.320]  A smattering of activists, he asked him to give in a try, but Mr. Obama has given no
[1:13:27.320 --> 1:13:29.360]  indication that he's thinking about it.
[1:13:29.360 --> 1:13:32.080]  The White House didn't respond to requests for comment on the story.
[1:13:32.080 --> 1:13:35.600]  Just like the White House and Hillary weren't behind the people that were trying to get
[1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:39.320]  the faithless electors to turn against Trump, and just like they weren't behind the recount
[1:13:39.320 --> 1:13:42.520]  in Jill Stein, and just like they weren't behind the Democratic Party showing the nomination
[1:13:42.520 --> 1:13:45.320]  for Bernie Sanders.
[1:13:45.320 --> 1:13:46.320]  They're going for broke.
[1:13:46.320 --> 1:13:50.760]  Now, let me give you the chilling news that was given to me during the last break.
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:54.520]  It's going up on infowars.com right now.
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:14:01.960]  It's from the amazing folks, I got to say, zero hedge is really hardcore, and I almost,
[1:14:01.960 --> 1:14:04.760]  I never see hardly anything on there I disagree with.
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:09.040]  Zero hedge, whoever runs it, no one knows, by the way, talk about other secret, even more
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:10.960]  closer than Drudge, no one knows.
[1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:15.320]  It's formerly some big top broker and a group of people that know what's going on, insiders.
[1:14:15.320 --> 1:14:17.840]  I'd say U.S. intelligence agency people, I don't know.
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:23.560]  But look at this, and again, whether you love Netanyahu or hate Netanyahu, Israel has done
[1:14:23.560 --> 1:14:26.840]  things politically that aren't anything compared to other people in the region.
[1:14:26.840 --> 1:14:28.160]  Why are they held to a higher standard?
[1:14:28.160 --> 1:14:29.160]  That's my only issue.
[1:14:29.160 --> 1:14:30.160]  I try to be fair here.
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:34.960]  They're surrounded by people that want to kill them, who say they want to overthrow and they're
[1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:39.840]  supposed to have a one state or a two state and open the borders up to a bunch of people
[1:14:39.840 --> 1:14:43.880]  that have basically gone there, just like Syria got invaded by a bunch of globalists
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:46.880]  in the last five years, a bunch of Islamists that wanted to take it over.
[1:14:46.880 --> 1:14:51.480]  Those aren't Syrian refugees coming into Europe, they're people that got their butt kicked out
[1:14:51.480 --> 1:14:52.480]  of the country.
[1:14:52.480 --> 1:14:53.480]  Turkey admits that.
[1:14:53.480 --> 1:14:58.400]  That's why 80% of them are military age men who have fake Syrian passports.
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:04.240]  They're Pakistani, they're Muslims from India, they're Muslims from all over the world from
[1:15:04.240 --> 1:15:10.200]  the United States, from England, but mainly from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Pakistan, you name
[1:15:10.200 --> 1:15:14.200]  it.
[1:15:14.200 --> 1:15:18.560]  Israel police, Internet and Yahoo's home for questioning over corruption allegations.
[1:15:18.560 --> 1:15:20.480]  The globalists are moving.
[1:15:20.480 --> 1:15:25.840]  You don't think Obama'd come out and have the UN vote to basically say Israel's illegitimate,
[1:15:25.840 --> 1:15:30.040]  and now they say they've got that new resolution ready, an actual one saying that Israel's
[1:15:30.040 --> 1:15:32.640]  illegitimate, and it should be overturned.
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:36.480]  And the UN's already voted on that before.
[1:15:36.480 --> 1:15:39.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, that's what I said last week, I said, if they kill Netanyahu or something
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:44.760]  you know World War III is about to happen, well, here it is, and I told you they're really
[1:15:44.760 --> 1:15:46.920]  thinking about arresting Trump.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:48.200]  They're really thinking about fault.
[1:15:48.200 --> 1:15:51.440]  Remember all those rape charges and pedophile charges that were always fake names and were
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:57.840]  never true and all got dropped as soon as she won, claiming Jerry Epstein connections
[1:15:57.840 --> 1:16:00.640]  to it when it was really to Clinton and Hillary.
[1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:03.520]  See everything they're doing, they say we're doing.
[1:16:03.520 --> 1:16:07.080]  So now this is zero hedge, Israeli police, Internet and Yahoo's home for questioning
[1:16:07.080 --> 1:16:08.960]  over corruption allegation.
[1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:14.400]  Boy, you talk about Canary in the coal mine, the globalists would move against Netanyahu
[1:16:14.400 --> 1:16:18.960]  as WikiLeaks shows they're planning to do via Soros if they weren't planning to have
[1:16:18.960 --> 1:16:25.320]  people ready to imprison him or kill him if he starts trying to spill the beans on stuff.
[1:16:25.320 --> 1:16:31.280]  Because Netanyahu has been involved in everything, good, bad, ugly, you name it, and if they
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:34.280]  move against Netanyahu, that means they're moving against Trump.
[1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:43.360]  Bet your bottom buck, woo, I mean this is in a reddable, just red alert, red alert,
[1:16:43.360 --> 1:16:50.080]  red alert, this is getting crazy.
[1:16:50.080 --> 1:16:54.400]  This is so fricking out of control.
[1:16:54.400 --> 1:16:59.480]  It's time to pray, our heavenly Father, please help us open our eyes, please help us be
[1:16:59.480 --> 1:17:02.560]  good, we're so sorry for all the abortions and all the evil in our name.
[1:17:02.560 --> 1:17:06.840]  Please protect the children, please reprieve us if it's in your will, please somehow stop
[1:17:06.840 --> 1:17:10.600]  the evil forces that are trying to stop this miracle that you've given us, please help
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:13.760]  there be peace in the Middle East, please stop those who are trying to overthrow Israel
[1:17:13.760 --> 1:17:17.480]  and start World War III and bring an Armageddon, please give us a reprieve like Nineveh so
[1:17:17.480 --> 1:17:21.320]  that we have time to wake people up and reach out to those that are still in darkness and
[1:17:21.320 --> 1:17:27.320]  deceive, please in your name of your son, Jesus Christ, lead God and direct us, amen.
[1:17:27.320 --> 1:17:32.000]  And I don't do that for show folks, I don't even want to be here, I am so upset right
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:37.360]  now that my head is burning, I am sweating even though it's like 65 degrees in here,
[1:17:37.360 --> 1:17:38.360]  I am so pissed.
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:42.960]  I see I shouldn't be on air, I'm going to start cussing, please God give me the strength.
[1:17:42.960 --> 1:17:47.520]  They're going to start nuclear war, they're pure evil, they're completely out of control
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:51.080]  and they're moving on every front and regardless what you think about Netanyahu or Trump,
[1:17:51.080 --> 1:17:58.080]  the globalists know they're nationalists, there's a nationalist
[1:17:58.080 --> 1:18:02.400]  allies organization forming from Japan to Israel to the United States to the U.K. to
[1:18:02.400 --> 1:18:03.400]  Russia.
[1:18:03.400 --> 1:18:06.600]  A lot of these groups are formerly enemies but they understand the globalists don't want
[1:18:06.600 --> 1:18:10.600]  prosperity and there's a move worldwide to get back to prosperity.
[1:18:10.600 --> 1:18:15.000]  These governments don't want to have people poor on average but it's the globalist plan
[1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.320]  and people are sick of it.
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:21.720]  Rome is horrible for the average person, it's horrible for the average elite.
[1:18:21.720 --> 1:18:26.680]  They don't want to see people poor and things falling apart, kingpins, even corrupt kingpins
[1:18:26.680 --> 1:18:31.160]  want to set up on top big powerful massive systems.
[1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:38.040]  They don't want to see enslavement, they don't want to see the public losing everything.
[1:18:38.040 --> 1:18:41.640]  Even the most corrupt Roman emperors wanted prosperity, it was only the occasional psychopath
[1:18:41.640 --> 1:18:45.280]  that wanted to kill everybody and make everybody poor and those people usually got their throat
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:47.760]  slit or poisoned.
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:52.240]  We have the worst type of psychopaths that want us to be poor, that want us to be desperate,
[1:18:52.240 --> 1:18:58.120]  who get off on it, really evil people in control and the whole world saying no and now Benjamin
[1:18:58.120 --> 1:19:03.280]  Netanyahu, they're looking at arresting him and throwing him in prison and you know what
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:09.040]  that means, the minute they take down Netanyahu they're going after Trump.
[1:19:09.040 --> 1:19:14.200]  So, hey, all of you that want to live under globalist Islamic rule, all of you that hate
[1:19:14.200 --> 1:19:19.760]  Jews, you're about to get a big juicy taste of the globalist win of what it's going to
[1:19:19.760 --> 1:19:23.320]  be like being under Saudi Arabia and communist China, politically calling the shots to the
[1:19:23.320 --> 1:19:28.560]  Democrats who've openly made deals to sell us out to them and then have weirdo Nazi collaborators
[1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:31.400]  like George Soros, who's Jewish, sitting over it.
[1:19:31.400 --> 1:19:36.920]  So, get your anti-Semitism straight there, you got this evil Dr. Evil over here running
[1:19:36.920 --> 1:19:40.960]  this whole takeover who's Jewish and they're about to get rid of the Jewish state, so just
[1:19:40.960 --> 1:19:41.960]  enjoy yourselves.
[1:19:41.960 --> 1:19:46.680]  You got to taste rounding up Jews in World War II, just it's so delicious, little Soros,
[1:19:46.680 --> 1:19:51.400]  he just can't stop and it's all in the WikiLeaks and you know what, the Jews haven't done
[1:19:51.400 --> 1:19:55.320]  anything to stop him, hell half the Jews are liberals, love George Soros, so hey, just have
[1:19:55.320 --> 1:19:56.840]  whatever you want, dumbasses.
[1:19:56.840 --> 1:20:01.640]  We'll be back with the rest on the police going after Netanyahu.
[1:20:01.640 --> 1:20:07.720]  Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:10.720]  Forget bunkers, you're not a live underground gopher.

[1:22:24.600 --> 1:22:28.200]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other threats can make obtaining sufficient

[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:06.720]  All right, I'm going to give the number out, if you tried to call earlier the phone system
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:07.720]  wasn't turned on.
[1:24:07.720 --> 1:24:11.440]  Now you can call in, they're clearly trying to overthrow Israel, they're clearly trying
[1:24:11.440 --> 1:24:17.240]  to overthrow Trump, who is an attempt by the people, but also patriots in our government,
[1:24:17.240 --> 1:24:22.800]  to reestablish just emergency life support on America, because our country has been taken
[1:24:22.800 --> 1:24:23.800]  over.
[1:24:23.800 --> 1:24:28.520]  These are epic, legendary, incredibly historic, dangerous times we're living in.
[1:24:28.520 --> 1:24:31.000]  We are in the middle of World War III.
[1:24:31.000 --> 1:24:35.000]  Now the Pentagon called World War III the Cold War, and they said World War IV will
[1:24:35.000 --> 1:24:40.760]  be fought with cyber war, political movements, riots, you name it, economic warfare.
[1:24:40.760 --> 1:24:45.040]  And we are now in that with the globalist playing countries off against each other,
[1:24:45.040 --> 1:24:49.760]  the nation states understand this and have sided to band together to try to bring prosperity
[1:24:49.760 --> 1:24:52.080]  back and are being blocked.
[1:24:52.080 --> 1:24:57.680]  Now what made the nation states finally decide to come together and defeat globalism was
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:03.920]  when the globalist openly allied with radical Islam and communist China to double cross
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:05.920]  the West.
[1:25:05.920 --> 1:25:10.120]  Our intelligence agencies are far from perfect, they're very corrupt, but when they finally
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:14.280]  saw the true end game, that it was a true betrayal of America and the West, not some
[1:25:14.280 --> 1:25:18.280]  global government where we balance power with Asia, they said, you know what, we're not
[1:25:18.280 --> 1:25:19.960]  doing this.
[1:25:19.960 --> 1:25:25.040]  Now I've talked to the highest levels of our government, but before I talked to the highest
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:29.760]  levels of our government, I talked to top generals, top colonels, top people in media,
[1:25:29.760 --> 1:25:32.560]  you name it, over the years, you've heard many of them here, from Matt Drudge to you
[1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:34.600]  name it.
[1:25:34.600 --> 1:25:37.480]  But it's not like I'm even communicating with them and they're communicating with me.
[1:25:37.480 --> 1:25:41.600]  We all see the same threat, we all know who the globalists are, we can read their books,
[1:25:41.600 --> 1:25:45.280]  the globalists are very honest about this in their own academic literature.
[1:25:45.280 --> 1:25:49.040]  They lie to the public, but academically, it's like Gruber getting up on C-spanning
[1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:55.440]  knowing, thank God the public so dumb, I was hired to come up with a lie to triple prices
[1:25:55.440 --> 1:25:58.200]  and thank God they have no attention span.
[1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:02.480]  He was with academics on C-span, a bunch of other professors with a bunch of graduate
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:07.760]  students learning how to be liars so they can get jobs in the government.
[1:26:07.760 --> 1:26:14.200]  So see, it's very bipolar because, or schizophrenic, because they'll deny it all to the public,
[1:26:14.200 --> 1:26:19.200]  but then intellectually and academically admit the whole thing.
[1:26:19.200 --> 1:26:22.320]  So, turns out I even missed this and folks, I can't get track of all of it, I told the
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:23.320]  crew give me sources.
[1:26:23.320 --> 1:26:28.440]  Well, it's RT, it's the Times of Israel last week, it's not just Zero Hedge, they reported
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:32.320]  last week that he was going to be questioned in two criminal probes and now the police
[1:26:32.320 --> 1:26:37.840]  raided his house this morning, Benjamin Yatn-Yahu, Yatn-Yahu to be questioned in two separate
[1:26:37.840 --> 1:26:42.480]  criminal probes, that's RT, again I've got Times of Israel reporting that police are
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:47.800]  called on Israeli Attorney General to allow them to open a full criminal investigation
[1:26:47.800 --> 1:26:50.760]  against Prime Minister Netanyahu, again that was last week.
[1:26:50.760 --> 1:26:56.880]  Now today they've raided his house, so you've got, look Obama wouldn't have moved against
[1:26:56.880 --> 1:27:02.640]  Israel last week if he didn't have operatives in the Israeli government who at least believe
[1:27:02.640 --> 1:27:08.560]  they're going to be able to stop Netanyahu and Trump and that's what I'm saying.
[1:27:08.560 --> 1:27:13.600]  Listen to me so carefully, this is the big enchilada, they're currently moving against
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:17.760]  Trump and Israel, they're currently moving against the UK with Brexit, they're currently
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:22.520]  moving against every nationalist movement, hardcore with illegal measures, the globalists
[1:27:22.520 --> 1:27:27.600]  are intending to stage a coup against the people's will and to start a war if they have
[1:27:27.600 --> 1:27:33.480]  to or even kill Trump and Netanyahu and you name it to keep their world government project
[1:27:33.480 --> 1:27:34.720]  afloat.
[1:27:34.720 --> 1:27:41.840]  We're in the middle of the greatest crisis humanity has ever seen and just like in France
[1:27:41.840 --> 1:27:47.200]  every time some nationalist is about to win they indict them and they're doing the same
[1:27:47.200 --> 1:27:51.840]  thing here or in the Netherlands the guy that's number one in the polls who's a nationalist
[1:27:51.840 --> 1:27:58.400]  they've indicted him and convicted him two weeks ago, three weeks ago, so it's on folks
[1:27:58.400 --> 1:28:03.120]  this is, this is crazy, look this means there's a civil war brewing in Israel, there's an
[1:28:03.120 --> 1:28:09.920]  ongoing civil war happening here and Israel has sources and forces inside of it that want
[1:28:09.920 --> 1:28:16.360]  to merge with the Arabs and the Palestinians and commit suicide and again it's all in the
[1:28:16.360 --> 1:28:20.560]  WikiLeaks that Soros was planning this five years ago, two years ago and just six months
[1:28:20.560 --> 1:28:26.480]  ago, this is a worldwide destabilization world government program with Soros, the Rothschilds
[1:28:26.480 --> 1:28:31.240]  and the Rockefellers bringing in this program and people say oh well the Rothschilds helped
[1:28:31.240 --> 1:28:36.560]  found Israel, that was 70 years ago folks, the Rothschilds currently are using Israel
[1:28:36.560 --> 1:28:41.480]  as a detonator to bring in a meat-eased war, the Rothschilds are heavily involved in all
[1:28:41.480 --> 1:28:46.400]  this, now they're a very diverse family, it's a big family but the big ones, Lord Rothschild
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:50.640]  and others are as evil as the day is long, this is the exact kind of crap they like to
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:55.960]  do, have his dad give birth to Israel then blow it up 70 years later and out of this
[1:28:55.960 --> 1:29:00.360]  comes their big world government because the war will be so horrible we have to accept
[1:29:00.360 --> 1:29:06.980]  the Luciferian age, this is big stuff, you know Al-Shukralli reportedly sacrificed his
[1:29:06.980 --> 1:29:13.000]  own son, when you get into Satanism, betrayal of your own family is the top final thing
[1:29:13.000 --> 1:29:21.640]  to do, so Israel you better watch your butt and the United States better as well, Israeli
[1:29:21.640 --> 1:29:25.360]  police internet now who's home for questioning over corruption allegations as the administration
[1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:32.040]  shunned last week, we warned that police were calling on Israeli Attorney General to allow
[1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:35.600]  them to open a full criminal investigation of Prime Minister Benjamin Yankee today, his
[1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:40.080]  channel 2 reports, Israel police entered BB's home for questioning, the prime minister was
[1:29:40.080 --> 1:29:45.160]  quick react, blasting, don't celebrate too soon over corruption probe, and then it gets
[1:29:45.160 --> 1:29:51.840]  into all of it, this is a major move against the West by the globalist, we're on the march,
[1:29:51.840 --> 1:30:00.920]  the empires on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:30:00.920 --> 1:30:06.320]  On New Year's Day in Kiev there was a torchlight procession, the Ukrainian neo-Nazis were marching
[1:30:06.320 --> 1:30:10.600]  through the center of the capitol celebrating the birthday of Stepan Bandera, the leader
[1:30:10.600 --> 1:30:14.680]  of the Ukrainian insurgent army who was also Nazi sympathizer and a collaborator during
[1:30:14.680 --> 1:30:19.520]  World War II, all the more reasons to be hailed as hero by the Maidan government, the followers
[1:30:19.520 --> 1:30:23.920]  of Bandera proudly promoting Nazi slogans and the symbolics of the Third Reich, hence
[1:30:23.920 --> 1:30:27.920]  their love for torchlight processions which were especially popular in Hitler's Germany,
[1:30:27.920 --> 1:30:32.640]  the present day admirers of Bandera are deeply misled, they glorify the myths given to them,
[1:30:32.640 --> 1:30:36.760]  conveniently ignoring the facts of history repeated in present day Ukraine, they murder
[1:30:36.760 --> 1:30:41.160]  their own countrymen under the guise of liberation of the people, they murder their own ideological
[1:30:41.160 --> 1:30:44.400]  supporters who happen to choose a different leader and they call it fighting for their
[1:30:44.400 --> 1:30:49.480]  country's independence, they murder and betray each other under the guise of unity and brotherhood,
[1:30:49.480 --> 1:30:54.080]  well let's call it for what it is, betrayal, betrayal of your people and your country and
[1:30:54.080 --> 1:31:20.080]  the enemy within is more dangerous than any outside threat, this has been Daria for InfoWars.com.
[1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:27.240]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone

[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:05.660]  is this so good?
[1:32:05.660 --> 1:32:10.120]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most,
[1:32:10.120 --> 1:32:15.540]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system
[1:32:15.540 --> 1:32:18.060]  But right now we're dealing with massive
[1:32:18.780 --> 1:32:25.140]  Parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees
[1:32:26.020 --> 1:32:31.380]  Spreading disease around we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites
[1:32:31.380 --> 1:32:33.720]  Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things that are in it
[1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:38.080]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud the organic wormwood
[1:32:38.080 --> 1:32:42.060]  I recommend doing a parasite plans at least twice a year. All right, well
[1:32:42.060 --> 1:32:44.640]  I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today
[1:32:44.640 --> 1:32:49.440]  It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live comm and folks you can't lose full of stuff
[1:32:49.440 --> 1:32:56.580]  It's great for your body period and you support the broadcast info wars lives comm. Thank you doctor group from the Global Healing Center
[1:32:56.680 --> 1:32:58.980]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product
[1:32:58.980 --> 1:33:11.020]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones
[1:33:20.180 --> 1:33:26.240]  All right, here's the bottom line there have been settlements for eight years of Obama's administration being built on the West Bank
[1:33:26.240 --> 1:33:34.400]  You've got the Muslims running around the jihadis the the the Sunnis who are invading
[1:33:35.440 --> 1:33:40.240]  30-something countries right now all over the world. I mean, there's 30 plus countries are launching terror attacks in it was like
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:44.360]  23 a few months ago. It's 30 something now. We're in the middle of a worldwide
[1:33:45.240 --> 1:33:51.080]  Jihad financed by Saudi Arabia our government with the criminals at the top in the Obama administration are financing it
[1:33:51.080 --> 1:33:55.240]  It's an all the wiki leaks that George Soros is commanding it and Han showing it
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:33:58.520]  And spending up to five billion dollars a year
[1:33:59.040 --> 1:34:07.320]  financing political groups and overthrow of Ukraine and funding jihadis all over Chechnya and you name it trying to overthrow Russia proper with
[1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:14.440]  Political candidates. He's been running against Russia. Then they have the nerve to claim Russia is involved in our politics when they're clearly not and
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:17.240]  then
[1:34:18.000 --> 1:34:24.100]  After eight years of settlements Obama comes out and has the US push a vote in the UN to abstain
[1:34:24.100 --> 1:34:27.880]  And now the word is Kerry has a resolution to fully say Israel's
[1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:34.720]  Illegitimate so that the Arab states will basically attack Israel with 17 days out and then
[1:34:35.240 --> 1:34:40.480]  We heard about corruption probes and stuff. Oh, suddenly somebody in Netanyahu's office says he might have gotten a bribe
[1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:46.040]  Here comes the police and the SWAT team to his house to tear his home apart this morning
[1:34:47.840 --> 1:34:52.560]  Obama vindictive for abstaining from UN vote on Israel settlements and
[1:34:52.560 --> 1:34:57.660]  Now they are going after Israel. I
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:03.560]  Don't know what the anti-semites are gonna do. I guess they're gonna side with George Soros against
[1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:10.840]  The the nation state of Israel, but understand this that's siding against our Republic and Trump as well
[1:35:15.080 --> 1:35:20.480]  Obama's refusal to veto anti-Israel UN vote ranked most anti-semitic incident in 2016
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:23.400]  You know, I don't want to say it's anti-semitic
[1:35:23.720 --> 1:35:27.040]  But funding jihadis all over the Middle East to kill every Christian
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:31.280]  They get a hold of is truly anti-Christian and where are the Christians complaining about that?
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:34.120]  But I know this it is anti-Israel
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:39.120]  To say turn it over to Palestinians who if they took it over would never stop killing each other
[1:35:40.840 --> 1:35:43.480]  They can't stop killing each other all over the Middle East
[1:35:43.480 --> 1:35:48.920]  It's a joke clean up your own house before you run around lecturing the rest of the world
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:50.640]  Muslims
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:55.120]  And I was against the wars against the Muslims because I knew it was to put the radical ones in I knew it was a
[1:35:55.280 --> 1:35:56.200]  destabilization program
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:03.240]  I'm not against Muslims, but you can't run around arrogant declaring that you're gonna conquer our culture and buy off our politicians and
[1:36:03.960 --> 1:36:06.080]  Basically throw it in our face without backlash
[1:36:08.520 --> 1:36:13.760]  So I'm gonna open the phones up from Hans and DJ and David and George and Philip, but I want to be clear
[1:36:13.760 --> 1:36:19.720]  I want to talk about the world destabilization program with 17 days left the Democrats admitting
[1:36:19.720 --> 1:36:26.320]  They want to try to block Trump being inaugurated. How will they do that with an East Coast power outage claiming the Russians did it?
[1:36:26.320 --> 1:36:28.320]  So blaming the power outage on
[1:36:28.760 --> 1:36:32.400]  The group they claims trying to put Trump in you say that doesn't make sense
[1:36:32.960 --> 1:36:37.920]  Russia should just sit back and let Trump get in of course. That's why the West has shot down three of their airplanes
[1:36:38.120 --> 1:36:41.560]  That's why they're starting wars and killing their ambassadors and diplomats
[1:36:41.560 --> 1:36:47.520]  It's why they're putting all these new sanctions on to poke the bear into action and Putin's been smart and hasn't done that
[1:36:47.520 --> 1:36:54.160]  It hasn't even kicked us diplomats out instead. He invited the diplomats and their kids to the Christmas tree lighting
[1:36:54.760 --> 1:36:57.520]  That's one of the big things in Russia for kids at the Kremlin
[1:36:58.040 --> 1:37:01.560]  You're like Alex Christmas ascended knowing Orthodox Church. It's
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:07.000]  January 7th folks and the point is is that they are being caught in all this massive fake news
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:13.240]  They wouldn't be running all this fake news ladies and gentlemen if they weren't planning something big
[1:37:13.240 --> 1:37:19.080]  And I said last week if they try to remove net and yahoo any time in the next three weeks
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:21.680]  You better believe
[1:37:21.840 --> 1:37:24.700]  It means they're about to try to take Trump out, too
[1:37:24.880 --> 1:37:32.360]  You could see attack helicopters flying into Marlago tomorrow and fire 20 hellfire missiles into there
[1:37:32.360 --> 1:37:36.640]  And they'll say on the news Trump had to be taken out. He was a terrorist. I'm not kidding
[1:37:36.640 --> 1:37:42.640]  Or they could blow up Trump Tower and claim jihadis did it or they could have a sniper kill Trump when he's on the golf course
[1:37:42.640 --> 1:37:49.840]  I'm telling you they are intending to kill Trump. By the way, pull it up. Just Google Alex Jones CIA
[1:37:50.480 --> 1:37:52.480]  click news
[1:37:52.920 --> 1:37:55.720]  Media matters run by the White House openly to the WikiLeaks
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:00.240]  Says Alex Jones warns Trump the CIA is trying to assassinate the president like no
[1:38:00.240 --> 1:38:06.520]  I said rogue criminal criminal elements are developing the idea and the plan that you're a Russian agent
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:12.240]  So if you're killed or arrested they can at least sell the idea to enough of the public to make it look legitimate and
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:19.640]  Now we see the CIA going around and Trump saying that rogue elements the CIA are trying to undermine his presidency in the world of
[1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:24.360]  The people well, what do you think the CIA does when their BS fails? They move on to weapons
[1:38:25.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  I want to be clear most the CIA is completely outraged by this
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:32.960]  Most the CIA is not even killing believe this is actually happening
[1:38:32.960 --> 1:38:36.840]  It's come out that the government agencies have said this is all fake. Uh
[1:38:38.080 --> 1:38:43.160]  Clapper has said it's all fake, but they still move forward. They mean business
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:51.760]  They wouldn't be saying a sitting president elect was a Russian agent unless they were planning to do anything from getting him to not get into office
[1:38:52.280 --> 1:38:55.680]  and now if they go after Trump's ally
[1:38:56.320 --> 1:38:59.440]  Israel and if they try to kick out that elected government
[1:38:59.440 --> 1:39:07.360]  With a corruption probe, you know, the next thing is going to be a criminal probe and the attorney general might even come out and indict a current president
[1:39:08.440 --> 1:39:13.840]  And then oh sadly a truck bomb goes off. I'm telling you they're willing to start World War three with Russia
[1:39:13.840 --> 1:39:17.640]  They're willing to start World War three with Russia
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:23.440]  Do you think they're willing to kill Trump or myself?
[1:39:23.440 --> 1:39:28.640]  They just signed a law a week and a half ago to ban the press and to put the CIA over the FCC
[1:39:28.640 --> 1:39:37.880]  There's been giant cyber attacks that drudge has never seen before against drudge and info wars and he says it's the US government
[1:39:37.880 --> 1:39:41.800]  It is the criminals that have hijacked it working with the communist Chinese
[1:39:42.520 --> 1:39:45.640]  Now Matt Bracken former Navy Seat old best-selling author researcher
[1:39:46.640 --> 1:39:50.360]  From enemies far in a domestic calm is joining us the bottom of the next hour. I
[1:39:51.080 --> 1:39:56.400]  Have a small skeleton crew here today, but you guys already found it with a quick search Matt Bracken
[1:39:56.400 --> 1:40:00.560]  Grid down false flag from may him on the show saying
[1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:06.520]  He said it last week. So if someone just gives maybe some of the guys back there in Anthony's office a
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:09.600]  Few of those files to watch I
[1:40:10.280 --> 1:40:12.280]  need our crew
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:17.000]  To find where Bracken said it ahead of him joining us because I know our listeners heard it
[1:40:17.000 --> 1:40:18.320]  I know you heard me talk about it
[1:40:18.320 --> 1:40:23.720]  But we need to play it for people that don't know so they understand just how on target we are because here's the deal
[1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:29.440]  It clicked earlier. They're running that Russia wants to knock our power grid out after we even warned
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:31.440]  That's the type of thing they might pull
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:38.360]  They hadn't said that previously but but see we understand what would be disruptive enough to keep it from getting in and where Obama could have an emergency
[1:40:38.360 --> 1:40:45.720]  It fit and now they're openly announcing it. That means they're seriously considering that and other false flags
[1:40:46.160 --> 1:40:48.160]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls
[1:40:48.160 --> 1:40:52.960]  And I thought I was pretty clear, but some people called it about Pokemon and about other stuff
[1:40:52.960 --> 1:40:56.640]  And that's fine, but I'm gonna move on to the next person callers after this group
[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:03.800]  I really want to talk about Civil War Netanyahu crisis false flags. They say they don't want Trump
[1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:08.760]  They're they're having newspapers everywhere call for Trump's death and call for people to kill him
[1:41:09.440 --> 1:41:17.480]  Almost no one's been prosecuted for this. It's unprecedented atmosphere of civil war and insanity and I'm here not being a fear monger
[1:41:17.480 --> 1:41:19.720]  I'm desperately raising the alarm
[1:41:19.720 --> 1:41:26.600]  So that sensible media covers this and so that other people understand just how much danger we're in
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:33.360]  So we don't go down the road of the real clear and present danger. That's the globalist that really are destabilizing things. I
[1:41:35.000 --> 1:41:40.160]  Also want you to know this isn't gonna stop even once Trump gets in but we'll be in a much better position from that point on
[1:41:40.160 --> 1:41:44.480]  But it's still going to be the most incredible science fiction movie
[1:41:44.480 --> 1:41:51.560]  You've ever seen or read that we're living and this is only gonna get wilder, but the good news is there's good and evil in the world
[1:41:51.560 --> 1:41:53.000]  not just evil and
[1:41:53.000 --> 1:41:58.920]  So we are in the real world in this epic time and everything you do is having a giant effect
[1:42:00.480 --> 1:42:04.560]  Pray for this country pray for awakening pray for Providence pray for
[1:42:04.920 --> 1:42:11.880]  Spiritual defense and support and provision for Trump and for info wars and for Matt drudge and for people like Steven
[1:42:11.880 --> 1:42:15.880]  Manin and others that are at the tip of the spear of this fight because of duty
[1:42:16.920 --> 1:42:20.880]  But understand this is real you can see it. It's not our opinion
[1:42:21.360 --> 1:42:26.120]  We are the people resisting this you are the folks resisting it. We're all in this together and
[1:42:26.760 --> 1:42:29.120]  None of us are perfect, but we've got God on our side
[1:42:30.400 --> 1:42:36.960]  Also, we're running extending the Christmas special just even more until Wednesday that it's over because people like it so much free shipping store-wide

[1:44:02.800 --> 1:44:06.000]  But the atmosphere is so dangerous. So out of control
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:11.760]  I've got a stack of New York Times articles here from over the weekend and Washington Post headlines where they admit
[1:44:12.440 --> 1:44:19.880]  That Obama is sabotaging the Trump agenda as he leaves office and they admit the stuff. He's doing hurts the economy opens the border up more
[1:44:19.880 --> 1:44:24.320]  I mean, we're just wide open. This is a true foreign globalist sabotage operation
[1:44:24.320 --> 1:44:30.320]  And we keep wondering why they're out to get us so much because it's a global military operation to bring us down
[1:44:30.320 --> 1:44:33.080]  So no nation-states left standing except the commonest Chinese
[1:44:34.080 --> 1:44:37.720]  And then they're so enslaved and the globalist of a deals with them
[1:44:37.720 --> 1:44:42.720]  They're supposed to be the muscle and then the economy of the world. We were betrayed. We were sold out
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:46.400]  Globalism was supposed to be invaded all the economic stuff and we had the military
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:50.320]  It was all a double-cross and our intelligence agencies know that
[1:44:50.320 --> 1:44:56.320]  And are fighting back. So what do you do when the American people and the American government stand up against the foreign globalist takeover?
[1:44:56.320 --> 1:45:00.820]  The malware that is the new world order infesting our political system and our soul
[1:45:01.320 --> 1:45:06.320]  They claim we're the foreign agents with no proof and they claim the Russians are trying to kick off the power grid
[1:45:07.320 --> 1:45:11.320]  I'm gonna stop screaming and yelling. I'm just really trying to cut through the chatter here
[1:45:12.320 --> 1:45:14.320]  But here's the goodness
[1:45:14.320 --> 1:45:21.320]  The Washington Post got caught publishing fake news. It's all over the news there, but see they don't care because they're going for broke
[1:45:21.320 --> 1:45:27.320]  They don't care. Sure. You're like God. They're discrediting themselves. Everything they do fails. They're escalating
[1:45:27.320 --> 1:45:33.320]  They're still in power for 17 days. It means they're going to go to the final thing open force
[1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:36.320]  They're gonna cook up fake charges against Trump
[1:45:36.320 --> 1:45:39.320]  If Trump resisted with the legitimate government behind him
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:47.320]  They're going to kill him. Trump, you're not stupid and you already know this. They're coming to kill you and your family. Period
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:56.320]  They want to kill this country. You have the courage. The people listen to you. You did it. You want to bring back the economic engine
[1:45:56.320 --> 1:46:00.320]  They don't want that. They don't want. They already tried to kill Nigel Farage three times
[1:46:00.320 --> 1:46:06.320]  I know you know this. I know the Secret Service know, but the public needs to know the battle is going to end
[1:46:06.320 --> 1:46:12.320]  I know the Secret Service know, but the public needs to know the battle, the epic level of the battle we're in right now
[1:46:12.320 --> 1:46:16.320]  And here's the deal. It doesn't mean BB or Israel is perfect. Nobody does
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:24.320]  But it's a sovereign country and the globalists have made a deal with Islam to sell out Israel and the US as part of this global takeover
[1:46:24.320 --> 1:46:31.320]  With Islam, China and the globalist against Russia, Japan and what's left of Latin America and Africa
[1:46:31.320 --> 1:46:36.320]  Folks, Africa and Latin America can't stand against the Chinese. They can't stand against the Islamists
[1:46:36.320 --> 1:46:45.320]  They can't stand against the globalists of the big corporations. It's the big corporations and China and Saudi Arabia against everybody else
[1:46:45.320 --> 1:46:53.320]  That's World War four, okay? They're coming for us. They are blown away
[1:46:53.320 --> 1:46:58.320]  That the intelligence agencies leaked all the data on them and that we stopped their steal and that we won
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:02.320]  Trump won in one of the biggest landslides in US history folks. They stole five states
[1:47:02.320 --> 1:47:08.320]  And I'll keep repeating this to you understand the epic level, the epic epic incredible time we are alive right now
[1:47:14.320 --> 1:47:18.320]  I want to tell the globalist something. Listen, I want you to know this
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:25.320]  Just as you failed stealing the nomination and you failed with the recount and you failed with the unfaithful electors
[1:47:25.320 --> 1:47:29.320]  And you failed with the race garbage crap and you failed with economic implosion and you failed
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:36.320]  You're going to fail when it comes to stopping the global revolution against tyranny and the reawakening of nationalism
[1:47:36.320 --> 1:47:43.320]  And the exuberant nationalism that has sorrow so scared last week. You are failing. You are failing now
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:48.320]  And if you try to kill Trump, even if you're successful, it will blow up in your face so bad
[1:47:48.320 --> 1:47:51.320]  There will be nowhere in the world for you to ever hide
[1:47:51.320 --> 1:47:55.320]  So in a way, I hope you strike myself and Trump down. I don't literally hope that
[1:47:55.320 --> 1:48:00.320]  But metaphysically, politically, in a chess sense, we're nothing but gambits
[1:48:00.320 --> 1:48:06.320]  You strike us down, we will become more powerful than you could possibly imagine
[1:48:06.320 --> 1:48:12.320]  They were able to find one of the Matt Bracken clips. Again, he's probably said this
[1:48:12.320 --> 1:48:18.320]  He's been on probably 15 times the last year or more. He says it every time he's on but he said last week
[1:48:18.320 --> 1:48:22.320]  I don't know if they found a clip from last week. They said they have a clip where he said
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:27.320]  What kind of false flag? He said, I would look at a grid down scenario to keep Trump from getting in a big crisis
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:32.320]  A day after he said that, he was here last Thursday, a day after he said it
[1:48:32.320 --> 1:48:38.320]  There's a bunch of these clips. I'm mixing them together. They rolled it out and it was fake as a $3 bill
[1:48:38.320 --> 1:48:42.320]  You go, oh good, they're discrediting again. No, it means they don't care
[1:48:42.320 --> 1:48:47.320]  Everybody's analyzing this like it's funny. Let me tell you something. My guts don't think it's funny
[1:48:47.320 --> 1:48:53.320]  I've never been on fire like this. I am sweating and I've got the air conditioner turned down to 65
[1:48:53.320 --> 1:48:58.320]  I am on fire. I am ready to kick like 15 people's asses. You understand what I'm saying?
[1:48:58.320 --> 1:49:02.320]  I am that concerned. I am that fired up physically. My spirit is on fire
[1:49:02.320 --> 1:49:07.320]  America and the whole world is in total peril. They are getting ready to start a nuclear war if need be
[1:49:07.320 --> 1:49:12.320]  Obama and Hillary and all of them need to be stopped right now
[1:49:12.320 --> 1:49:17.320]  Here's the most important thing I've been wanting to tell you for days. I just get so upset I don't get it out
[1:49:17.320 --> 1:49:22.320]  Everything has to be leaked. Do not hold anything back
[1:49:22.320 --> 1:49:27.320]  US intelligence agencies, Western intelligence agencies, private corporate groups, everybody
[1:49:27.320 --> 1:49:32.320]  Anonymous, everyone. Hit them with everything you've got. Don't wait. Don't leak it slowly
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:38.320]  They've got Assange on house arrest. They've stopped stuff coming out. Leak everything now. Leak it now
[1:49:38.320 --> 1:49:43.320]  Hit them with everything now. Hit them. Hit them with everything now
[1:49:43.320 --> 1:49:48.320]  And again, I personally let you see how fired up I am. This isn't an act
[1:49:48.320 --> 1:49:53.320]  But I'm letting the dog off the leash, you understand? This is how I feel. This is who I am
[1:49:53.320 --> 1:49:57.320]  This is actually therapy for me to like get it out and not get physical, okay?
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:03.320]  Now, people say, oh Alex, this is an actor. No, that's not what I'm saying. It's a paradox
[1:50:03.320 --> 1:50:06.320]  I really feel like this right now. If I didn't yell and scream, I guess I'd probably have a heart attack
[1:50:06.320 --> 1:50:11.320]  Okay? Or get mad at somebody in traffic. This is really how I feel
[1:50:11.320 --> 1:50:15.320]  But because I do this, it primitively cuts through even intellectuals' controls
[1:50:15.320 --> 1:50:21.320]  Where they're just used to this, have a learned helplessness and a normalcy bias and a Stockholm syndrome
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:26.320]  That we're trying to break. We're breaking the enemy spirit of failure and weakness right now
[1:50:26.320 --> 1:50:30.320]  We're breaking the spirit of honor and strength and innovation back into the world
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:36.320]  The renaissance that Christ gave us. I'm gonna skip this break, so I'm gonna call some people
[1:50:36.320 --> 1:50:40.320]  I don't want to cut them off. Thank you. I forgot to tell you
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:44.320]  So, for whatever reason, as obnoxious as I am, wars aren't pretty
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:49.320]  Info wars is a big bloody battering ram that has knocked out more globalist teeth than anybody can imagine
[1:50:49.320 --> 1:50:53.320]  And that's thanks to your prayers and your support. You are the Info War
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:58.320]  I don't just say that again to make you feel good. Do you understand you are everything?
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:03.320]  Do you understand without you we're done? Don't be demoralized if they get me or Trump
[1:51:03.320 --> 1:51:07.320]  You understand? That just means they had to really get naked and get out in the open with us
[1:51:07.320 --> 1:51:12.320]  And I don't physically look forward to that, but I tell you what
[1:51:12.320 --> 1:51:16.320]  When my soul's rolling off this moral coral, if I got time to think about what's happening to me
[1:51:16.320 --> 1:51:20.320]  I'm gonna be really happy knowing we force them all the way out in the open
[1:51:20.320 --> 1:51:23.320]  And these vampires don't do too good out in the open
[1:51:23.320 --> 1:51:27.320]  But this isn't a movie. It isn't entertainment. People sit there and they watch so much entertainment
[1:51:27.320 --> 1:51:31.320]  Or they watch stuff that was historically happening. And when it's really happening in their face
[1:51:31.320 --> 1:51:36.320]  They can't believe it's even happening in their time. You're living in an incredible time
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:39.320]  You're living in a legendary world, people say
[1:51:39.320 --> 1:51:43.320]  Have you seen this new action-adventure movie? I'm like, yeah, I'm sure it's great
[1:51:43.320 --> 1:51:47.320]  We're living in an action-adventure movie
[1:51:47.320 --> 1:51:50.320]  They're trying to arrest the Israeli prime minister right now
[1:51:50.320 --> 1:51:55.320]  That means they're going to the next level. Let's go to your phone calls
[1:51:55.320 --> 1:51:59.320]  The numbers are coming out how Obama purposely killed the jobs for young people
[1:51:59.320 --> 1:52:02.320]  So that women would be independent, I mean, wouldn't be independent
[1:52:02.320 --> 1:52:06.320]  And would be under the control of the government and families would be dependent
[1:52:06.320 --> 1:52:09.320]  I mean, it's just everything's coming out, but more needs to come out now
[1:52:09.320 --> 1:52:12.320]  You know what? All the pedophilia stuff needs to be released
[1:52:12.320 --> 1:52:16.320]  All the criminal government drug dealing stuff just release it all, release it all
[1:52:16.320 --> 1:52:19.320]  Before they put the internet kill switch in, which they already have in place
[1:52:19.320 --> 1:52:24.320]  Before they start the next big war, I understand that people have already gone a great risk
[1:52:24.320 --> 1:52:26.320]  What you've already put out
[1:52:26.320 --> 1:52:30.320]  Everything has to come out now, justice be done, may the heavens fall
[1:52:30.320 --> 1:52:33.320]  Because the heavens are going to fall if we don't
[1:52:33.320 --> 1:52:37.320]  We don't have any more choices, we don't have any more time to even have half-measures
[1:52:37.320 --> 1:52:45.320]  Only total commitment to fight the enemy and they can spiritually feel that determination
[1:52:45.320 --> 1:52:47.320]  This is a spiritual fight and I can feel the enemy too
[1:52:47.320 --> 1:52:51.320]  They have made the decisions as of yesterday morning, I felt it
[1:52:51.320 --> 1:52:54.320]  I don't want to get into mumbo jumbo here, but everybody knows what I'm talking about
[1:52:54.320 --> 1:52:56.320]  Everybody else who's trying to feel it too
[1:52:56.320 --> 1:52:59.320]  At around 11 o'clock yesterday, I felt it, and let me tell you
[1:52:59.320 --> 1:53:05.320]  They have made the decisions to do some really bad stuff that physically endangers myself and my family
[1:53:05.320 --> 1:53:09.320]  And it doesn't mean I'm only in danger, you understand?
[1:53:09.320 --> 1:53:13.320]  I've learned to go with my gut, it's always right, this is everybody's in danger
[1:53:13.320 --> 1:53:17.320]  They have made decisions and you now see the manifestation of it because they're doing it
[1:53:17.320 --> 1:53:19.320]  That is just hellish
[1:53:19.320 --> 1:53:22.320]  Snot knows arrogant crazy person Obama and his crazy wife
[1:53:22.320 --> 1:53:24.320]  And all those crazy people with chips on their shoulders around them
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:30.320]  That hate anybody that's successful, that hate anybody that's Christian
[1:53:30.320 --> 1:53:33.320]  The globalists aren't stopping, folks
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:36.320]  They're moving forward, they are going to drop the hammer
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:41.320]  And I'm just telling you right now, we better throw everything we've got against them now
[1:53:41.320 --> 1:53:44.320]  In the information war, or they're going to have their way
[1:53:44.320 --> 1:53:47.320]  And I want to tell all the minions of this system who know they're on the wrong side
[1:53:47.320 --> 1:53:49.320]  And who do it for paycheck and peer pressure
[1:53:49.320 --> 1:53:53.320]  I want to warn you, there's still time for you to leak the information you've got
[1:53:53.320 --> 1:53:57.320]  People at Media Matters, you should leak everything you've got if you want to save your family and yourself
[1:53:57.320 --> 1:54:03.320]  This isn't a movie, this isn't a joke, don't laugh about it, just remember you were warned
[1:54:03.320 --> 1:54:08.320]  People inside CNN, people inside these agencies, people inside these traitorous organizations
[1:54:08.320 --> 1:54:11.320]  You've got to release everything you've got right now
[1:54:11.320 --> 1:54:18.320]  Yeah, I know they call up and they say, hey, the new character in this movie or that movie is based on you and they make fun of you and act like all this other stuff
[1:54:18.320 --> 1:54:22.320]  None of that stuff is going to matter, we're way past all that right now
[1:54:22.320 --> 1:54:29.320]  I don't mean leak stuff like that, I mean leak at all
[1:54:29.320 --> 1:54:39.320]  They can't stop everybody if everybody does it, they want to fight, let's give them one
[1:54:39.320 --> 1:54:43.320]  George in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead, thanks for holding
[1:54:43.320 --> 1:54:51.320]  Yes, Alex, this is where they want to be, they're going to start World War III, this has always been the plan
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:57.320]  They always have, sure having Hillary be elected would have been great, they can do whatever they want
[1:54:57.320 --> 1:55:01.320]  Yeah, they were still going to start a war when she got in, they were going to shut the press down when she got in and send all the WikiLeaks
[1:55:01.320 --> 1:55:02.320]  Yes, this is not...
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:06.320]  They're just going ahead like Trump wasn't even elected, what does that tell you?
[1:55:06.320 --> 1:55:10.320]  They don't care because they're crazy and I think they're possessed personally
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:12.320]  Oh, they definitely are, they're damn demons
[1:55:12.320 --> 1:55:20.320]  You know, faints within faints within faints, knowing where the trap is, that's the first step in defeating it
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:30.320]  I think the Patriot movement is reactionary because that's the only way to not start a hot civil war with these people
[1:55:30.320 --> 1:55:37.320]  Well, that's right, we've got to, exactly, I'm telling you, they tried to weasel me into some confrontation with brainwashed cops or something
[1:55:37.320 --> 1:55:41.320]  I just let them take me out because I'm not going to let them use myself against the movement
[1:55:41.320 --> 1:55:47.320]  So we have to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, but that's what I'm saying, I'm nonviolent when it comes to offense
[1:55:47.320 --> 1:55:54.320]  But for everybody else, that's not the case you're in if stuff breaks down, defend your family, go after the enemy to the end once they really start the real war
[1:55:54.320 --> 1:56:01.320]  And now we have to put everything in, all in in the info war, what else do you think we can do right now to really back the enemy off?
[1:56:01.320 --> 1:56:09.320]  Because let me tell you, as of yesterday, I could feel it and now you see it in the news, they have decided to go full bore and stop Trump
[1:56:09.320 --> 1:56:15.320]  And that means they're going to arrest Netanyahu, they're going to arrest or kill Trump in the next 17 days, watch, watch
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:19.320]  Now, if we stop it, people say, oh look, you know, another prediction you made that didn't come true
[1:56:19.320 --> 1:56:23.320]  No, I'm saying we can change this, what else do we do?
[1:56:23.320 --> 1:56:25.320]  We pray?
[1:56:25.320 --> 1:56:36.320]  Well, George, excuse me, Alex, I believe that something you said earlier in the show about how the globalists are intent on minimalizing Trump's election victory
[1:56:36.320 --> 1:56:42.320]  I think they're also very successful in isolating patriots within our communities
[1:56:42.320 --> 1:56:49.320]  I think we need to really take and reach out to the people that we touch on a daily basis, that's the most important thing
[1:56:49.320 --> 1:56:57.320]  You know, we're not all media savvy stars like you, but we impact people's lives constantly in our jobs, our schools, et cetera
[1:56:57.320 --> 1:57:01.320]  So now's the time because they're listening now, they're listening
[1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:08.320]  We've been hammering the message of freedom and of independence for so long
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:10.320]  And finally, the very-
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:15.320]  And exactly what we warned, world government, all of it has come true, because we're following globalists own admissions, thank you so much
[1:57:15.320 --> 1:57:23.320]  That's a great point, George, we go to Hans and Andy and Chris and Philip and others, the toll-free number to join us on the next 17 days
[1:57:23.320 --> 1:57:29.320]  800-25 at 9-9-2-3-1, 800-25 at 9-9-2-3-1
[1:57:29.320 --> 1:57:37.320]  Again, we reach a giant audience, if you'll get the word out, and if you'll expose these people, and if you'll point out what they're doing, they won't be able to pull it off
[1:57:37.320 --> 1:57:43.320]  But I said last week, I said they wouldn't move against Israel like this unless they were planning a coup inside Israel
[1:57:43.320 --> 1:57:48.320]  I think I said that Tuesday or Wednesday of last week
[1:57:48.320 --> 1:58:01.320]  And I said, so watch Israel, this is really bold, and I told you last week I was watching a Wednesday night situation room with Wolf Blitzer, but they had a fill-in host
[1:58:01.320 --> 1:58:07.320]  And I was watching it, and they were all like, a giant war is coming, it is Trump's fault and other nationalists
[1:58:07.320 --> 1:58:12.320]  We are sad, and there was a bunch of people that are admittedly CIA operatives and others that were on the show
[1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:17.320]  I mean, Blitzer's Assad himself, but I left his arm of it, that's admittedly he didn't know, look it up, high level
[1:58:17.320 --> 1:58:23.320]  But he wasn't on the show, and they were all like, yes, it's coming, they all looked scared, but they were all like, look down, they were in a cult
[1:58:23.320 --> 1:58:28.320]  They went, well, this war wasn't our fault, and what's coming now, it's those that did this
[1:58:28.320 --> 1:58:32.320]  We must have our plan for peace, that means world government, it's a cult, it's like a New Age cult
[1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:43.320]  They all just go, ugh, and then they went to break, and I went, oh my god, I told you, I said they're getting ready, they're gonna overthrow Israel, and now it's happening
[1:59:05.320 --> 1:59:14.320]  Well, I got news for them, just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017
[1:59:14.320 --> 1:59:20.320]  We're talking store-wide free shipping and 50 to 25% off on the nutraceuticals and so much more
[1:59:20.320 --> 1:59:26.320]  So whether it's a Hillary from prison 2017 shirt, or whether it's Survival Shield X2, our super male vitality
[1:59:26.320 --> 1:59:32.320]  We've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017, while supplies last
[1:59:32.320 --> 1:59:36.320]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big, and we've extended it
[1:59:36.320 --> 1:59:40.320]  So please take advantage of this, and again, thank you for fighting for the Info War
[1:59:40.320 --> 1:59:45.320]  And supporting our operation, and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide
[1:59:45.320 --> 1:59:57.320]  That's infowarsstore.com, or go right to the supplements at infowarslive.com
[2:00:40.320 --> 2:00:42.320]  So a lot of people want to see Israel blown up
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:45.320]  A lot of liberals, a lot of right-wingers, well, you might get your chance here real soon
[2:00:45.320 --> 2:00:51.320]  At least carved up, and you're gonna get carved up too, and you're gonna get more George Soros, more Hillary, more Obama
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:56.320]  See, all the geopolitical connections they claim are going on, it's much more complex
[2:00:56.320 --> 2:01:02.320]  It's layer upon layer, group upon group, a whole bunch, like six different combine groups in Israel
[2:01:02.320 --> 2:01:07.320]  Bunch of different subgroups over here, everybody just dumbs it down to this group against that group
[2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:13.320]  Mexicans against the white people, or white people against the black people, it's all idiocy
[2:01:13.320 --> 2:01:18.320]  When any of us lose rights, we all lose rights, we're all under globalist attack
[2:01:18.320 --> 2:01:21.320]  Matt Brackham's joining me at the bottom of the hour, I'm about to go back to your calls
[2:01:21.320 --> 2:01:26.320]  Here's the former Navy sealant author that just keeps saying, he's looking for a grid down false flag
[2:01:26.320 --> 2:01:30.320]  Well now, they claim the Russians tried to bring the grid down last week, the story was a hoax
[2:01:30.320 --> 2:01:32.320]  But it came out of the mouth of Surin
[2:01:32.320 --> 2:01:37.320]  It came out of the Washington Post, meaning they're preparing the public for a grid down
[2:01:37.320 --> 2:01:43.320]  This just took us to death-con too
[2:01:43.320 --> 2:01:48.320]  I'm worried about some hackers, you know, could be Russia, but we won't be able to prove it
[2:01:48.320 --> 2:01:51.320]  Turning our lights out, our cities are time bombs
[2:01:51.320 --> 2:01:55.320]  Without electricity, our cities are as vulnerable as if they don't relate to something later
[2:01:55.320 --> 2:01:57.320]  And again, the Russians have said they don't want to do that
[2:01:57.320 --> 2:02:00.320]  It's the globalists that are the masters of this, they've put everything in
[2:02:00.320 --> 2:02:04.320]  They've got the kill switches, the number one suspect is the Obama types
[2:02:04.320 --> 2:02:07.320]  That if they can't control it all, they want to burn it down
[2:02:07.320 --> 2:02:13.320]  Obama told Africa, you can't have credit cards, you can't have credit cards, you can't have cars, you can't have air conditioning
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:15.320]  They're already telling us, go ahead Matt
[2:02:15.320 --> 2:02:20.320]  But Russia will be the boogeyman, just like with the election, that was another tell, that was another giveaway
[2:02:20.320 --> 2:02:25.320]  Sure, they're preparing them to be the boogeyman of the future, saying if there's ever a cyber attack, we're going to blame Russia
[2:02:25.320 --> 2:02:29.320]  The Russians did it, just like they stole the election from poor Hillary
[2:02:29.320 --> 2:02:38.320]  So yeah, no matter who it is, it's almost sure that whatever the fingerprints are on the mission will be false fingerprints
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:44.320]  That's right, they used a Cyrillic keyboard, it wasn't the Russians, for sure
[2:02:44.320 --> 2:02:48.320]  But we won't know, we won't know, we'll be debating years later who killed the power
[2:02:48.320 --> 2:02:52.320]  It's an incredible time Matt, Matt Bracken is our guest
[2:02:52.320 --> 2:02:58.320]  Matt Bracken, stay right there, again, is it better for people to visit your website, enemiesfarrenanddomestic.com
[2:02:58.320 --> 2:03:00.320]  Or the Gates of Vienna
[2:03:00.320 --> 2:03:05.320]  Dot com, some of my short stories are posted on Gates of Vienna, you can look for me there
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:07.320]  I'll just stop right there
[2:03:07.320 --> 2:03:11.320]  We've got Vlad in Alabama holding a bunch of others, I'm going to really be a good boy now, go to your calls, bam, bam, bam
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:15.320]  As soon as we come back from break, but I don't want to cut your shorts, so Hans, stay there
[2:03:15.320 --> 2:03:19.320]  I'm going to take Hans, Andy, Vlad, Don and Phillip's calls all in the next 12 minutes second
[2:03:19.320 --> 2:03:23.320]  They'll give you each about two minutes, so be ready, I'm going to go right to you
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:28.320]  And yes, if you're a new listener, I am genuinely controlled hysteric right now
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:34.320]  And by the way, in a bad situation, I'm very calm, I'm very focused, it's that
[2:03:34.320 --> 2:03:41.320]  I'm letting myself get hysterical on air because I'm trying to get people out of their
[2:03:41.320 --> 2:03:47.320]  Stayed, learned, helplessness, dot com syndrome, I know I keep going back to that, but
[2:03:47.320 --> 2:03:51.320]  I genuinely am on fire right now
[2:03:51.320 --> 2:03:56.320]  I'm on fire right now, concerned about the country and the world, not just intellectually
[2:03:56.320 --> 2:04:01.320]  What I'm seeing, my gut that is never wrong is on fire
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:07.320]  I mean, I am on fire, like I am, I say like when I worry about globalists or pick up on something
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:14.320]  And get that tingle in your stomach, intuition, it's like a flamethrower is shooting right through the middle of me right now, okay
[2:04:14.320 --> 2:04:18.320]  I mean, I'd barely even be on air, I'm sweating in a 65 degree studio
[2:04:18.320 --> 2:04:21.320]  Because this is so epic, it's so huge, it's so real
[2:04:21.320 --> 2:04:25.320]  And you've seen time and time again when I say get ready for all hell to break loose, it does
[2:04:25.320 --> 2:04:27.320]  But everybody else can feel it
[2:04:27.320 --> 2:04:30.320]  And I think if you already called me yesterday and he goes, do you feel it? It was about 2 o'clock
[2:04:30.320 --> 2:04:36.320]  And I was in my car driving back to the office and I said, yeah, I feel it, horrible
[2:04:36.320 --> 2:04:39.320]  He goes, yeah, they're not going to give up, are they? They're going to go for it all
[2:04:39.320 --> 2:04:44.320]  I go, no, they're going to go for it all, they're going to arrest Trump, they're going to go after Israel
[2:04:44.320 --> 2:04:49.320]  And sure enough, man, it's all happening, they've swat team Benjamin Netanyahu
[2:04:49.320 --> 2:04:53.320]  And he just tuned in and he said, oh, good, he's corrupt, I let it on message boards
[2:04:53.320 --> 2:04:57.320]  Oh, good, kill the Jews, that's so fashionable
[2:04:57.320 --> 2:05:14.320]  Senator John McCain, one of the main proponents of sanctions against Russia and pusher of fake news regarding Russian hacks, was accompanied by the Ukrainian president Soros' laptop Petro Poroshenko on his visit to a Russian speaking city in the southeastern Ukraine
[2:05:14.320 --> 2:05:25.320]  While making a Happy New Year speech addressing his soldiers who are fighting against the pro-Russian people's republics, he made a baffling statement that put a face of awkward perplexity on his troops
[2:05:25.320 --> 2:05:34.320]  Ukrainian president declared that the Donbass region is under the Ukrainian occupation and that it is only temporary and that Ukraine will surely be united once again
[2:05:34.320 --> 2:05:45.320]  He followed with the popular neo-Nazi colon response motto saying, glory to Ukraine to which the baffled soldiers had to respond with glory to the heroes after an awkward pause
[2:05:45.320 --> 2:05:52.320]  Naturally, all the printed media had conveniently corrected his speech, replacing Ukrainian occupation with Russian occupation
[2:05:52.320 --> 2:06:00.320]  But alas, the speech was broadcasted live and was seen and heard by millions of people. This has been Daria for Infowars.com

[2:07:06.320 --> 2:07:09.320]  Dr. Griff, you took years for you to develop DNA Force for us
[2:07:09.320 --> 2:07:15.320]  It's been something that I've been working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important
[2:07:15.320 --> 2:07:21.320]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres
[2:07:21.320 --> 2:07:24.320]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes
[2:07:24.320 --> 2:07:26.320]  And when it runs out, you start dying
[2:07:26.320 --> 2:07:30.320]  We chose the PQQ because it has over 175 different clinical trials
[2:07:30.320 --> 2:07:33.320]  It's one of the most effective substances in the world
[2:07:33.320 --> 2:07:35.320]  It works like an antioxidant
[2:07:35.320 --> 2:07:38.320]  It works to repair nerve growth factor
[2:07:38.320 --> 2:07:41.320]  So this is a formula to deliver the maximum amount
[2:07:41.320 --> 2:07:42.320]  It's in powder form
[2:07:42.320 --> 2:07:45.320]  We have so many five-star reviews

[2:08:14.320 --> 2:08:19.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order
[2:08:19.320 --> 2:08:24.320]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:08:24.320 --> 2:08:26.320]  All right, Matt Bracken is going to be hosting
[2:08:26.320 --> 2:08:30.320]  a fourth hour former Navy SEAL best-selling author
[2:08:30.320 --> 2:08:35.320]  Last week, he was on the day before they launched the fake
[2:08:35.320 --> 2:08:37.320]  Cyber attack that they said the Russians launched
[2:08:37.320 --> 2:08:40.320]  on a Vermont power plant trying to bring down the East Coast
[2:08:40.320 --> 2:08:42.320]  He said that that's what he'd look for
[2:08:42.320 --> 2:08:44.320]  and then we had a back-and-forth discussion
[2:08:44.320 --> 2:08:48.320]  about how it would be blamed on the Russians
[2:08:48.320 --> 2:08:52.320]  And then it hit me today, they're doing that to test float the idea
[2:08:52.320 --> 2:08:54.320]  because I went back and looked this morning
[2:08:54.320 --> 2:08:56.320]  They've never come out and said they thought the Russians
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:08:57.320]  would hit our power grid
[2:08:57.320 --> 2:08:59.320]  They're now floating that idea ahead of that
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:02.320]  as the perfect scenario to block Trump
[2:09:02.320 --> 2:09:04.320]  at his inauguration but also blame him
[2:09:04.320 --> 2:09:06.320]  We'll talk to Matt Bracken in about 25 minutes
[2:09:06.320 --> 2:09:08.320]  Briefly, free shipping store-wide
[2:09:08.320 --> 2:09:10.320]  I'm just extending it through Wednesday
[2:09:10.320 --> 2:09:12.320]  People love it so much
[2:09:12.320 --> 2:09:16.320]  At the end of the year, we have to get rid of all of our inventory
[2:09:16.320 --> 2:09:19.320]  My December 31st, we have a few days
[2:09:19.320 --> 2:09:22.320]  and most of the nutraceuticals and t-shirts and other things
[2:09:22.320 --> 2:09:23.320]  have sold out
[2:09:23.320 --> 2:09:24.320]  We've got more coming in the next few weeks
[2:09:24.320 --> 2:09:25.320]  but a lot of it's sold out
[2:09:25.320 --> 2:09:27.320]  We still have 30% off for male vitality
[2:09:27.320 --> 2:09:30.320]  We still have 30% off superfemale vitality
[2:09:30.320 --> 2:09:33.320]  33% off brain force, our new tropic and so many others
[2:09:33.320 --> 2:09:35.320]  but they are selling out and it could be months
[2:09:35.320 --> 2:09:37.320]  until some of the other items come back in
[2:09:37.320 --> 2:09:39.320]  So thank you all for your support
[2:09:39.320 --> 2:09:41.320]  Take advantage of store-wide free shipping
[2:09:41.320 --> 2:09:43.320]  and some of the biggest specials in our history

[2:09:49.320 --> 2:09:52.320]  Hans in Pennsylvania, thanks for holding it on the air
[2:09:52.320 --> 2:09:55.320]  Yes, good afternoon
[2:09:55.320 --> 2:09:57.320]  I haven't heard anybody bring this up yet
[2:09:57.320 --> 2:10:01.320]  but I think President Trump is going to be most vulnerable
[2:10:01.320 --> 2:10:05.320]  to assassination while he's standing at the podium on January 20th
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:08.320]  With all the technology that's out there
[2:10:08.320 --> 2:10:09.320]  they could fly a drone in
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:12.320]  or God knows what else they could do to take him out
[2:10:12.320 --> 2:10:17.320]  and I'm hoping that secret surfers will be looking up in the sky
[2:10:17.320 --> 2:10:20.320]  as well as in their immediate area there during this
[2:10:20.320 --> 2:10:24.320]  or even consider doing the inauguration
[2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:27.320]  at a more secure and non-public place
[2:10:27.320 --> 2:10:29.320]  Well, notice Trump says he's doing it real fast
[2:10:29.320 --> 2:10:32.320]  to get back to the country's work and not have pomp and circumstance
[2:10:32.320 --> 2:10:35.320]  He wants to go into the White House bunker
[2:10:35.320 --> 2:10:37.320]  In fact, I can tell people this
[2:10:37.320 --> 2:10:39.320]  just because it's already known by the enemy
[2:10:39.320 --> 2:10:42.320]  Trump is going to go immediately into the White House bunker
[2:10:42.320 --> 2:10:43.320]  just everybody knows
[2:10:43.320 --> 2:10:44.320]  Okay, I'm going to stop right there
[2:10:44.320 --> 2:10:46.320]  He understands what's going on
[2:10:46.320 --> 2:10:48.320]  That's how they know too
[2:10:48.320 --> 2:10:50.320]  He understands America's on its deathbed
[2:10:50.320 --> 2:10:52.320]  They're going to have DoD, my friend
[2:10:52.320 --> 2:10:54.320]  and again, I'm not saying something the enemy doesn't know
[2:10:54.320 --> 2:10:58.320]  They're going to have the highest tech anti-aircraft missiles on top
[2:10:58.320 --> 2:11:01.320]  Our military already pulled out from Obama five years ago
[2:11:01.320 --> 2:11:05.320]  Our military has already knows that this isn't our government
[2:11:05.320 --> 2:11:07.320]  That's why they leaked all the info
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:10.320]  What I'm telling you brother is yes, he is massively defended
[2:11:10.320 --> 2:11:13.320]  They may try a frontal assault claiming corruption
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:15.320]  You name it and come arrest him
[2:11:15.320 --> 2:11:16.320]  That's what I'm telling you
[2:11:16.320 --> 2:11:17.320]  Look at Benjamin Netanyahu
[2:11:17.320 --> 2:11:21.320]  Don't you see how the two things are tied together?
[2:11:21.320 --> 2:11:25.320]  My concern is for them to take something like a stupid quad rotor
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:27.320]  and just fly it right in there
[2:11:27.320 --> 2:11:30.320]  and blow him up while he's right at the podium
[2:11:30.320 --> 2:11:34.320]  Put a jihadi, there's a helicopter pilot in a helicopter full of C-4
[2:11:34.320 --> 2:11:37.320]  No, even a quad rotor, if you look on YouTube
[2:11:37.320 --> 2:11:39.320]  there's a video there, a quad rotor
[2:11:39.320 --> 2:11:41.320]  No, no, I know, but they've got programs that block those
[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:43.320]  and jamming signals for drones
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:46.320]  I mean, I think it could be somebody in a hijacked aircraft
[2:11:46.320 --> 2:11:52.320]  that's running non-high tech, non-digital analog systems
[2:11:52.320 --> 2:11:55.320]  I don't think he should give them even one second of exposure
[2:11:55.320 --> 2:11:58.320]  because if he does, they may decide to try and use it
[2:11:58.320 --> 2:12:00.320]  I know, and they'll say, oh look, he's hiding
[2:12:00.320 --> 2:12:02.320]  I don't think it's hiding when you're the top general
[2:12:02.320 --> 2:12:05.320]  and they're shooting at you, but George Washington led from the front
[2:12:05.320 --> 2:12:08.320]  Here's the deal, is anybody bored right now?
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:11.320]  I mean, is anybody bored?
[2:12:11.320 --> 2:12:13.320]  Those that are ignorant
[2:12:13.320 --> 2:12:16.320]  Yeah, but I mean, is this not an incredible time to be alive, Hans?
[2:12:16.320 --> 2:12:19.320]  It's absolutely amazing, I can't believe the stuff that's going on
[2:12:19.320 --> 2:12:21.320]  It's mind-boggling
[2:12:21.320 --> 2:12:24.320]  God bless you, sir, and I can't believe how the general public comes up
[2:12:24.320 --> 2:12:29.320]  and asks me stuff like, oh, have you seen the new Hawaii 5.0 episodes?
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:32.320]  I'm like, I actually like Hawaii 5.0, yeah
[2:12:32.320 --> 2:12:36.320]  I don't have time to watch it, though, because, you know, I'm in them, you know
[2:12:36.320 --> 2:12:40.320]  And I'm not putting people down, it's so epic
[2:12:40.320 --> 2:12:44.320]  No, I don't know who's in the playoffs
[2:12:44.320 --> 2:12:51.320]  I'm not against football, it's just the real playoff for the future of the world's going on right now, baby
[2:12:51.320 --> 2:12:53.320]  And it's not like we're getting conquered by folks that are just a different group
[2:12:53.320 --> 2:12:55.320]  then I wouldn't be fighting so hard
[2:12:55.320 --> 2:12:57.320]  The globalists are bad people
[2:12:57.320 --> 2:13:01.320]  I could see them and feel them coming 25 years ago
[2:13:01.320 --> 2:13:03.320]  And now they're here, and man, do they stink
[2:13:03.320 --> 2:13:04.320]  Thank you, Hans
[2:13:04.320 --> 2:13:06.320]  Let's talk to Vlad and Alabama
[2:13:06.320 --> 2:13:08.320]  Vlad, you're on the air, go ahead
[2:13:08.320 --> 2:13:12.320]  Yeah, first I'd like to actually say thank you for what you're doing
[2:13:12.320 --> 2:13:15.320]  because honestly, I don't think many of us are going to be able to hear you
[2:13:15.320 --> 2:13:17.320]  hearing those very near future
[2:13:17.320 --> 2:13:19.320]  I honestly believe that they're either going to take you out
[2:13:19.320 --> 2:13:22.320]  or you're going to get murdered, same with Trump
[2:13:22.320 --> 2:13:27.320]  The reasoning that I'm calling is, my personal view on what I think is going to be happening
[2:13:27.320 --> 2:13:30.320]  and like I said, they're either going to shut your foolers down
[2:13:30.320 --> 2:13:34.320]  They're going to take you out, they're going to either have Trump assassinated during the inauguration
[2:13:34.320 --> 2:13:36.320]  or right before or right afterwards
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:38.320]  They're not going to let him be president very long
[2:13:38.320 --> 2:13:42.320]  And personally, as a long haul truck driver, at this point I'm considering putting my job
[2:13:42.320 --> 2:13:45.320]  going home, finding something to do locally
[2:13:45.320 --> 2:13:48.320]  because I don't think that, you know, even something what I'm doing
[2:13:48.320 --> 2:13:51.320]  I don't think any of this is going to last very much longer, not even more
[2:13:51.320 --> 2:13:54.320]  I would say, I was going to be going on the road the next few days
[2:13:54.320 --> 2:13:56.320]  and going and having some meetings and things
[2:13:56.320 --> 2:13:58.320]  and I was going to leave it at that
[2:13:58.320 --> 2:14:00.320]  I'd imagine the media could put two and a half together
[2:14:00.320 --> 2:14:02.320]  and I'm tempted to not even leave
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:05.320]  just because, but then I
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:08.320]  I don't need to warn people in person, put you that way
[2:14:10.320 --> 2:14:12.320]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not the point to worry about it
[2:14:12.320 --> 2:14:15.320]  I just know that this isn't about pop and circus dance, exactly
[2:14:15.320 --> 2:14:18.320]  Like, I've already, I'm not going to even get into it
[2:14:18.320 --> 2:14:20.320]  The point is, this is so serious, I'm like, I can do more here
[2:14:20.320 --> 2:14:23.320]  I don't need to even go have somebody pat me on the head and say thank you
[2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:26.320]  I mean, you know what I mean, I mean, I'm so in the bunker at this point
[2:14:26.320 --> 2:14:28.320]  that I don't even care about meeting with the president
[2:14:28.320 --> 2:14:30.320]  I'm sorry, just go ahead
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:33.320]  Yeah, I mean, like, with me, it's, you know, quote, you know, staying in the bunker
[2:14:33.320 --> 2:14:36.320]  for me, all of what I have, like my family
[2:14:36.320 --> 2:14:38.320]  everyone else is back in Washington state
[2:14:38.320 --> 2:14:40.320]  I'm currently two and a half thousand miles away
[2:14:40.320 --> 2:14:42.320]  from the only form of protection that I have
[2:14:42.320 --> 2:14:45.320]  you know, my weapons, my gear, everything that I have
[2:14:45.320 --> 2:14:48.320]  everything that I need to help my family stay protected
[2:14:48.320 --> 2:14:50.320]  is, you know, thousands of miles away
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:52.320]  my family's thousands of miles away
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:54.320]  Well, there's no mistake, this is the most dangerous time
[2:14:54.320 --> 2:14:56.320]  in the time America could fall forever
[2:14:56.320 --> 2:14:58.320]  We were partially captured, the most dangerous time
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:00.320]  getting the face sucker off is when you're cutting it loose
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:03.320]  and so we are in the most dangerous point in our
[2:15:03.320 --> 2:15:05.320]  244 year history, it is happening
[2:15:05.320 --> 2:15:08.320]  I'm getting chills right now, it is happening right now
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:10.320]  I wouldn't want you to lose your job
[2:15:10.320 --> 2:15:13.320]  but I would tell you, if you took a week off
[2:15:13.320 --> 2:15:16.320]  around the inauguration, that'd be a smart time to be back with your family
[2:15:16.320 --> 2:15:18.320]  because if we make it through this
[2:15:18.320 --> 2:15:21.320]  we go from just sudden death over time
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:24.320]  edge of your seat, hair standing up on the end
[2:15:24.320 --> 2:15:26.320]  to just major crisis
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:28.320]  which I just want to get out of this crisis
[2:15:28.320 --> 2:15:31.320]  I don't want to, I wasn't going to be here today
[2:15:31.320 --> 2:15:33.320]  I was going to be on a hunting trip months ago
[2:15:33.320 --> 2:15:35.320]  with my family but I had to, I'm not bitching
[2:15:35.320 --> 2:15:37.320]  I just, I can't do anything anymore
[2:15:37.320 --> 2:15:40.320]  because it's too epic, I feel guilty when I'm not doing it
[2:15:40.320 --> 2:15:42.320]  not because I'm a goody two shoes
[2:15:42.320 --> 2:15:45.320]  when someone is politically on top of us breaking our nose
[2:15:45.320 --> 2:15:47.320]  gouging our eyeballs out politically
[2:15:47.320 --> 2:15:49.320]  we've got to fight back brother
[2:15:51.320 --> 2:15:53.320]  yeah I mean, you have a really good point there
[2:15:53.320 --> 2:15:55.320]  you make a lot of really good points
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:15:57.320]  it's just, what I'd like to tell everyone else
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:00.320]  and you probably, you only need to call me one of the people listening at this point is
[2:16:00.320 --> 2:16:03.320]  make sure that whatever you're doing, you do it now
[2:16:03.320 --> 2:16:06.320]  up first and foremost, make sure that you get right with God
[2:16:06.320 --> 2:16:09.320]  because if you don't have that, nothing else, everything else is going to fall apart
[2:16:09.320 --> 2:16:11.320]  exactly, you know what, that's the take away today
[2:16:11.320 --> 2:16:14.320]  get right with God, if America was right with God
[2:16:14.320 --> 2:16:17.320]  we wouldn't be in this position and we're trying to get right right now
[2:16:17.320 --> 2:16:20.320]  and the frickin devil doesn't want us to get loose, does he?
[2:16:20.320 --> 2:16:22.320]  nope
[2:16:22.320 --> 2:16:25.320]  anything else I was interrupting you
[2:16:25.320 --> 2:16:28.320]  I mean, honestly, that's pretty much all I wanted to say is
[2:16:28.320 --> 2:16:30.320]  because there's millions upon millions of people listening
[2:16:30.320 --> 2:16:33.320]  those that have the information, they need to leak everything right now
[2:16:33.320 --> 2:16:36.320]  like you were saying, because we only have just over two weeks
[2:16:36.320 --> 2:16:40.320]  everyone else that, you know, they're not necessarily sure if God exists
[2:16:40.320 --> 2:16:43.320]  they may be agnostic, they may be Buddhist, they may do whatever they are
[2:16:43.320 --> 2:16:46.320]  they need to come to the realization that the only way that they're going to make it out of this
[2:16:46.320 --> 2:16:48.320]  the only way they're going to make it any further
[2:16:48.320 --> 2:16:51.320]  ask what they see with, you know, our flesh eyes
[2:16:51.320 --> 2:16:53.320]  is if they get right with Jesus Christ
[2:16:53.320 --> 2:16:55.320]  the other thing that I'd like to say is
[2:16:55.320 --> 2:16:57.320]  whatever you're doing physically here on earth
[2:16:57.320 --> 2:17:00.320]  you need to speed it up, you need to ramp everything 100 times over
[2:17:00.320 --> 2:17:02.320]  get everything squared away like right now
[2:17:02.320 --> 2:17:05.320]  not next month, not two weeks from now, do it right now
[2:17:05.320 --> 2:17:07.320]  do it today, do everything that you can now
[2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:09.320]  because you may not have another option
[2:17:09.320 --> 2:17:13.320]  you know there's a new Washington Post article by their editors saying
[2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:15.320]  Trump reading info wars can tank markets
[2:17:15.320 --> 2:17:17.320]  start wars basically
[2:17:17.320 --> 2:17:19.320]  we put that headline back up
[2:17:19.320 --> 2:17:21.320]  they're getting ready to tank the markets
[2:17:21.320 --> 2:17:23.320]  they're raising interest rates to tank the markets
[2:17:23.320 --> 2:17:25.320]  they're getting ready to knock out the power grid
[2:17:25.320 --> 2:17:27.320]  they're going to blame Trump, they're going to blame the Russians
[2:17:27.320 --> 2:17:30.320]  everything they do
[2:17:30.320 --> 2:17:32.320]  everything they blame us of is what they're really planning
[2:17:32.320 --> 2:17:34.320]  in Washington Post editor
[2:17:34.320 --> 2:17:37.320]  Trump reading info wars can tank markets, invite incursions
[2:17:37.320 --> 2:17:39.320]  why do you think Trump reads info wars?
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:41.320]  let me just go ahead and tell the mainstream media
[2:17:41.320 --> 2:17:43.320]  because they don't seem to figure it out
[2:17:43.320 --> 2:17:47.320]  it's not just Flynn that listens and reads info wars
[2:17:47.320 --> 2:17:49.320]  it's all of them dummies
[2:17:49.320 --> 2:17:51.320]  I'm not bragging
[2:17:51.320 --> 2:17:54.320]  and by the way the generals don't learn anything from me
[2:17:54.320 --> 2:17:56.320]  there's only a couple websites
[2:17:56.320 --> 2:17:58.320]  like worldnetdailydrugreport.com
[2:17:58.320 --> 2:18:00.320]  right Barton info wars
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:03.320]  that they can go read that they know are real
[2:18:03.320 --> 2:18:05.320]  you understand that dumbass?
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:07.320]  excuse me, I'm sorry, God I apologize
[2:18:07.320 --> 2:18:08.320]  I'm not trying to be like that
[2:18:08.320 --> 2:18:10.320]  I'm so angry folks, I don't have my normal filters
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:13.320]  I start thinking about the new order and I get really angry
[2:18:15.320 --> 2:18:18.320]  the generals all listen stupid
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:21.320]  the foreign governments listen stupid
[2:18:21.320 --> 2:18:24.320]  because they know, we know what we're talking about
[2:18:24.320 --> 2:18:26.320]  we're dead on
[2:18:26.320 --> 2:18:29.320]  I don't say that from some ego perspective
[2:18:29.320 --> 2:18:31.320]  I wish I was wrong
[2:18:31.320 --> 2:18:34.320]  the point is we've got to get on me blueprints
[2:18:34.320 --> 2:18:37.320]  we're on air trying to rally America to wake up
[2:18:37.320 --> 2:18:39.320]  of course generals
[2:18:39.320 --> 2:18:42.320]  hear Paul Revere screaming 10 miles away and go yeah
[2:18:42.320 --> 2:18:44.320]  yeah he's got it, that's it
[2:18:44.320 --> 2:18:46.320]  we're not heroes folks
[2:18:46.320 --> 2:18:49.320]  we just hate George Soros, he's out to get us
[2:18:52.320 --> 2:18:55.320]  and the call is right, we're not going to be here soon
[2:18:55.320 --> 2:18:58.320]  the way they're moving, I mean I
[2:18:58.320 --> 2:19:00.320]  I got calls
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:03.320]  from high level people about three weeks ago
[2:19:03.320 --> 2:19:05.320]  and they said I don't know what, we're going to skip this break
[2:19:05.320 --> 2:19:06.320]  so I got the calls
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:09.320]  they said Alex I don't know what you've done to Nancy Pelosi's daughter
[2:19:09.320 --> 2:19:12.320]  but Nancy Pelosi's having hearings right now behind closed doors
[2:19:12.320 --> 2:19:16.320]  and wants the Justice Department to trump all this stuff up and come arrest you
[2:19:16.320 --> 2:19:19.320]  the next day I got another call
[2:19:19.320 --> 2:19:22.320]  if you ever wonder if you can believe Larry Nichols
[2:19:22.320 --> 2:19:25.320]  I got this from somebody in New York
[2:19:25.320 --> 2:19:28.320]  Larry Nichols calls up from Arkansas and goes Alex I don't know what you did
[2:19:28.320 --> 2:19:31.320]  but I just talked to sessions number one guy
[2:19:31.320 --> 2:19:33.320]  and sessions just figuring out what he can do
[2:19:33.320 --> 2:19:35.320]  because they know you're a test case for everybody
[2:19:35.320 --> 2:19:37.320]  it's not they don't love you
[2:19:37.320 --> 2:19:39.320]  but they realize it's a test case for everybody
[2:19:39.320 --> 2:19:41.320]  that's Bill, they want to ban the media, you heard about that
[2:19:41.320 --> 2:19:44.320]  well they want a head of that Bill to have the case point be you
[2:19:44.320 --> 2:19:47.320]  and they're going to claim you're hiring insurrections
[2:19:47.320 --> 2:19:49.320]  and want Nancy Pelosi's daughter killed
[2:19:49.320 --> 2:19:51.320]  have you heard about this Alex?
[2:19:51.320 --> 2:19:55.320]  and I went no, I've been exposing her without even saying anything violent
[2:19:55.320 --> 2:19:58.320]  wanting to have the electors turn against Trump
[2:19:58.320 --> 2:20:02.320]  so then she goes on Fox that night
[2:20:02.320 --> 2:20:06.320]  and goes Alex Jones wants me killed I'm scared
[2:20:06.320 --> 2:20:09.320]  remember we play and I was like oh my god
[2:20:09.320 --> 2:20:12.320]  I mean I believe the New York source that called me
[2:20:12.320 --> 2:20:16.320]  from Trump Tower, I believe the other sources
[2:20:16.320 --> 2:20:18.320]  but then when you're watching it the next night
[2:20:18.320 --> 2:20:20.320]  and she's on TV going help me
[2:20:20.320 --> 2:20:23.320]  Alex Jones is going to kill me
[2:20:23.320 --> 2:20:26.320]  I mean you know looking to see what's having an effect
[2:20:26.320 --> 2:20:29.320]  and Kovuto you want me dead too
[2:20:29.320 --> 2:20:31.320]  Kovuto's like that's ridiculous
[2:20:31.320 --> 2:20:33.320]  what the hell are you talking about?
[2:20:33.320 --> 2:20:38.320]  I mean Nancy Pelosi is so crazy
[2:20:38.320 --> 2:20:42.320]  that she's strutting around in front of Loretta Lynch
[2:20:42.320 --> 2:20:44.320]  literally in a meeting where they're going
[2:20:44.320 --> 2:20:47.320]  my daughter has death threats and Alex Jones is dangerous
[2:20:47.320 --> 2:20:50.320]  and he wants her dead and I want him arrested
[2:20:50.320 --> 2:20:55.320]  these people are crazy
[2:20:55.320 --> 2:20:58.320]  they're nuts
[2:20:58.320 --> 2:21:00.320]  so no do you think I get a power trip
[2:21:00.320 --> 2:21:02.320]  well that's almost the opposite of a power trip
[2:21:02.320 --> 2:21:04.320]  I want oxygen I want them out of my life
[2:21:04.320 --> 2:21:08.320]  I want them from on top of my chest off of me
[2:21:08.320 --> 2:21:10.320]  they're like spiritual succubus
[2:21:12.320 --> 2:21:15.320]  but that shows how weird and I mean
[2:21:15.320 --> 2:21:17.320]  Pelosi's never killed anybody personally
[2:21:17.320 --> 2:21:19.320]  Pelosi couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag
[2:21:19.320 --> 2:21:22.320]  but she's in charge of rogue intelligence agencies
[2:21:22.320 --> 2:21:24.320]  and big money and foreign groups
[2:21:24.320 --> 2:21:26.320]  that are so freaked out and so pissed
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:29.320]  they're psychosomatically looking for some way
[2:21:29.320 --> 2:21:31.320]  to get wound up and crazy enough
[2:21:31.320 --> 2:21:32.320]  you know how a woman will do
[2:21:32.320 --> 2:21:34.320]  especially a woman if they're nuts
[2:21:34.320 --> 2:21:36.320]  to launch some purge on the media
[2:21:36.320 --> 2:21:38.320]  and they're in there barking up the justice department
[2:21:38.320 --> 2:21:41.320]  Loretta Lynch after two days said no we're not doing it
[2:21:41.320 --> 2:21:43.320]  well of course you're not doing it
[2:21:43.320 --> 2:21:45.320]  everybody knows I'm not calling for violence
[2:21:45.320 --> 2:21:49.320]  but but they passed the bill
[2:21:51.320 --> 2:21:53.320]  so that's what I'm telling you
[2:21:53.320 --> 2:21:55.320]  they're coming they're crazy
[2:21:55.320 --> 2:21:58.320]  and they're led by some 75 year old woman
[2:21:58.320 --> 2:22:00.320]  with a bunch of Botox
[2:22:00.320 --> 2:22:02.320]  who's clearly on a bunch of psychotropic drugs
[2:22:02.320 --> 2:22:04.320]  looks nuttier than Carrie Fisher
[2:22:04.320 --> 2:22:06.320]  God rest her soul nothing against Carrie Fisher
[2:22:06.320 --> 2:22:08.320]  but take one look at her
[2:22:08.320 --> 2:22:09.320]  I said is she mentally ill
[2:22:09.320 --> 2:22:10.320]  everybody said oh you don't know
[2:22:10.320 --> 2:22:12.320]  and I went and googled it and found out
[2:22:12.320 --> 2:22:13.320]  how freaking nut she was
[2:22:13.320 --> 2:22:15.320]  well you look at Nancy Pelosi
[2:22:15.320 --> 2:22:17.320]  that's a crazy woman
[2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:20.320]  with John McCain take one look at John McCain
[2:22:20.320 --> 2:22:22.320]  that guy's completely insane
[2:22:22.320 --> 2:22:24.320]  they call him insane McCain
[2:22:24.320 --> 2:22:26.320]  he once wore with Russia
[2:22:27.320 --> 2:22:29.320]  these people are crazy
[2:22:33.320 --> 2:22:35.320]  I'm gonna settle down
[2:22:38.320 --> 2:22:40.320]  Loretta we're gonna recap all the bracken coming up
[2:22:40.320 --> 2:22:42.320]  but they basically move forward
[2:22:42.320 --> 2:22:44.320]  they start the proceedings for the indictment and arrest
[2:22:44.320 --> 2:22:46.320]  that's in the news of Benjamin Netanyahu
[2:22:46.320 --> 2:22:47.320]  before Trump gets in
[2:22:47.320 --> 2:22:49.320]  and I told you last week I said
[2:22:49.320 --> 2:22:50.320]  and again I don't say I told you
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:51.320]  because I'm gonna be a big shot
[2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:53.320]  I told you like I told you
[2:22:53.320 --> 2:22:55.320]  if the canary in the coal mine falls over dead
[2:22:55.320 --> 2:22:57.320]  get out
[2:22:59.320 --> 2:23:01.320]  if your smoke alarm goes off at 3 a.m.
[2:23:01.320 --> 2:23:03.320]  and there's thick smoke
[2:23:03.320 --> 2:23:05.320]  get on the ground and crawl out of the house
[2:23:05.320 --> 2:23:06.320]  your house is on fire
[2:23:06.320 --> 2:23:08.320]  it's not like I told you
[2:23:08.320 --> 2:23:09.320]  the smoke detector went off
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:11.320]  I told you they went after Netanyahu
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:13.320]  that we were in trouble because I
[2:23:13.320 --> 2:23:15.320]  I'm so smart now
[2:23:15.320 --> 2:23:17.320]  I don't want to say it's not
[2:23:17.320 --> 2:23:19.320]  it's me begging I told you next
[2:23:19.320 --> 2:23:21.320]  if they go after the Israeli leadership
[2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:23.320]  that sided with the United States
[2:23:23.320 --> 2:23:24.320]  against the globalist takeover
[2:23:24.320 --> 2:23:25.320]  I told you
[2:23:25.320 --> 2:23:27.320]  I mean it's not that Israel is perfect
[2:23:27.320 --> 2:23:29.320]  but the end of America is about to happen
[2:23:29.320 --> 2:23:31.320]  and right wing Jews are siding with the U.S.
[2:23:31.320 --> 2:23:33.320]  that's the point this has gotten to
[2:23:33.320 --> 2:23:35.320]  you understand there ain't many friends
[2:23:35.320 --> 2:23:37.320]  we got left got Russia
[2:23:37.320 --> 2:23:39.320]  some right wing Jews what's left of the UK
[2:23:39.320 --> 2:23:41.320]  overrun by Islamist
[2:23:41.320 --> 2:23:43.320]  the big mega banks
[2:23:43.320 --> 2:23:45.320]  flushing the whole world economy down the toilet
[2:23:45.320 --> 2:23:47.320]  a nuclear bomb of economic
[2:23:47.320 --> 2:23:49.320]  collapse about to hit
[2:23:51.320 --> 2:23:53.320]  and we said the next
[2:23:53.320 --> 2:23:55.320]  tripwire the next domino is a move against
[2:23:55.320 --> 2:23:57.320]  the right wing Israeli government
[2:23:57.320 --> 2:23:59.320]  and you know all hell is
[2:23:59.320 --> 2:24:09.320]  breaking loose it just broke loose
[2:24:09.320 --> 2:24:11.320]  I'm gonna say it again every intelligence
[2:24:11.320 --> 2:24:13.320]  agency out there you know we were hijacked
[2:24:13.320 --> 2:24:15.320]  by foreign criminals you know this is a foreign takeover
[2:24:15.320 --> 2:24:17.320]  it is your duty not your right
[2:24:17.320 --> 2:24:19.320]  and not your prerogative your duty
[2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:21.320]  to release everything
[2:24:21.320 --> 2:24:23.320]  you've got and not overthink it
[2:24:23.320 --> 2:24:25.320]  and look not that you're stupid
[2:24:25.320 --> 2:24:27.320]  but you were you were hired because your OCD
[2:24:27.320 --> 2:24:29.320]  you were hired because you're neurotic
[2:24:29.320 --> 2:24:31.320]  about information you were hired because you could be trusted
[2:24:31.320 --> 2:24:33.320]  you were hired because you were compulsive
[2:24:33.320 --> 2:24:35.320]  you were hired because you'd follow orders
[2:24:35.320 --> 2:24:37.320]  I'm giving you orders
[2:24:37.320 --> 2:24:39.320]  your own souls giving you orders
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:41.320]  the current real president
[2:24:41.320 --> 2:24:43.320]  not the fake is giving you orders
[2:24:43.320 --> 2:24:45.320]  like you said before I don't know who's leaking all the crimes
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:47.320]  but they're the ones committing the crimes
[2:24:47.320 --> 2:24:49.320]  leak them
[2:24:49.320 --> 2:24:51.320]  that's the president of the United States
[2:24:51.320 --> 2:24:53.320]  the real one that's why the globalist are
[2:24:53.320 --> 2:24:55.320]  passed because finally we got a president
[2:24:55.320 --> 2:24:57.320]  after two decades that isn't
[2:24:57.320 --> 2:24:59.320]  an imposter
[2:24:59.320 --> 2:25:01.320]  George W. Bush
[2:25:01.320 --> 2:25:03.320]  George W. Bush might have cared about the troops
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:05.320]  and might have actually thought he was doing a good job
[2:25:05.320 --> 2:25:07.320]  but he wouldn't run anything the guy's an idiot
[2:25:07.320 --> 2:25:09.320]  Clinton's pure evil
[2:25:09.320 --> 2:25:11.320]  Herbert Walker
[2:25:11.320 --> 2:25:13.320]  was evil
[2:25:13.320 --> 2:25:15.320]  McEvellian
[2:25:15.320 --> 2:25:17.320]  bought into dreams of this big world government
[2:25:17.320 --> 2:25:19.320]  well guess what we're 30 years later
[2:25:19.320 --> 2:25:25.320]  we don't like your world government it stinks
[2:25:25.320 --> 2:25:27.320]  who's been holding longest
[2:25:27.320 --> 2:25:29.320]  Phillipa Pennsylvania on the air
[2:25:29.320 --> 2:25:31.320]  hello Alex nice to finally talk
[2:25:31.320 --> 2:25:33.320]  you've been trying for three months
[2:25:33.320 --> 2:25:35.320]  well thank you for having me worked up to
[2:25:35.320 --> 2:25:37.320]  I'm kind of sweating
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:39.320]  it's cold as heck here in Pennsylvania
[2:25:39.320 --> 2:25:41.320]  and now with this coming out of Israel
[2:25:41.320 --> 2:25:43.320]  I think Israel's probably going to be
[2:25:43.320 --> 2:25:45.320]  the next place we go to war
[2:25:45.320 --> 2:25:47.320]  I was thinking it would be here with
[2:25:47.320 --> 2:25:49.320]  the power grid
[2:25:49.320 --> 2:25:51.320]  and everything else you brought up but it's packed
[2:25:51.320 --> 2:25:53.320]  packed back if you would say
[2:25:53.320 --> 2:25:55.320]  if a Russian program was found on that
[2:25:55.320 --> 2:25:57.320]  it wasn't the Russians you would use
[2:25:57.320 --> 2:25:59.320]  Chinese or another foreign
[2:25:59.320 --> 2:26:01.320]  government that we're going to do that with
[2:26:01.320 --> 2:26:03.320]  so what
[2:26:03.320 --> 2:26:05.320]  I guess
[2:26:05.320 --> 2:26:07.320]  right now because I'm freaking out
[2:26:07.320 --> 2:26:09.320]  totally well let's be clear it was
[2:26:09.320 --> 2:26:11.320]  it was malicious malware
[2:26:11.320 --> 2:26:13.320]  that comes out of all these different countries
[2:26:13.320 --> 2:26:15.320]  it's never been connected to the Russian government
[2:26:15.320 --> 2:26:17.320]  it was a former that has come out of Russia
[2:26:17.320 --> 2:26:19.320]  and has been tracked back to Russian hackers
[2:26:19.320 --> 2:26:21.320]  that just steal credit card numbers that's not their
[2:26:21.320 --> 2:26:23.320]  government it's just it's retail fraud
[2:26:23.320 --> 2:26:25.320]  it'd be like if retail Chinese
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:27.320]  hackers got on people's computers here
[2:26:27.320 --> 2:26:29.320]  which they do they're the biggest culprits and then we blame
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:31.320]  China and called for war
[2:26:31.320 --> 2:26:33.320]  the communist Chinese government has officially
[2:26:33.320 --> 2:26:35.320]  for
[2:26:35.320 --> 2:26:37.320]  years taken credit for the giant
[2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:39.320]  cyberattacks
[2:26:39.320 --> 2:26:41.320]  of the OPM hack that stole
[2:26:41.320 --> 2:26:43.320]  all the US government
[2:26:43.320 --> 2:26:45.320]  personnel's private information
[2:26:45.320 --> 2:26:47.320]  now Obama kept that secret
[2:26:47.320 --> 2:26:49.320]  for a year from the public so when they blame some
[2:26:49.320 --> 2:26:51.320]  laptop that has some
[2:26:51.320 --> 2:26:53.320]  Russian origin malware
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:55.320]  on it it's only playing
[2:26:55.320 --> 2:26:57.320]  to the public's ignorance about computers
[2:26:57.320 --> 2:26:59.320]  I'm not that smart and I know this is a fraud
[2:26:59.320 --> 2:27:01.320]  all of the tech people began
[2:27:01.320 --> 2:27:03.320]  laughing within seconds of Friday's story
[2:27:03.320 --> 2:27:05.320]  but still McCain's calling for nuclear war
[2:27:05.320 --> 2:27:07.320]  so again a virus
[2:27:07.320 --> 2:27:09.320]  on somebody's computer that's malware
[2:27:09.320 --> 2:27:11.320]  that might have come from Russia a year ago
[2:27:11.320 --> 2:27:13.320]  when every country has
[2:27:13.320 --> 2:27:15.320]  hackers doing stuff is the excuse
[2:27:15.320 --> 2:27:17.320]  now for nuclear war with Russia
[2:27:17.320 --> 2:27:19.320]  yes sir
[2:27:19.320 --> 2:27:21.320]  yeah that that's where I'm at too
[2:27:21.320 --> 2:27:23.320]  and it's just very
[2:27:23.320 --> 2:27:25.320]  scary that they want to throw the nuclear war
[2:27:25.320 --> 2:27:27.320]  out at us
[2:27:27.320 --> 2:27:29.320]  it just has me scared because like you said
[2:27:29.320 --> 2:27:31.320]  since he got elected that
[2:27:31.320 --> 2:27:33.320]  you know you didn't feel safe
[2:27:33.320 --> 2:27:35.320]  and I was like why why doesn't Alex Terms
[2:27:35.320 --> 2:27:37.320]  feel safe well now I don't feel safe
[2:27:37.320 --> 2:27:39.320]  either and I want to say thank you from the bottom
[2:27:39.320 --> 2:27:41.320]  of my heart for giving America
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:43.320]  the real news of what's going on
[2:27:43.320 --> 2:27:45.320]  well thank you brother listen
[2:27:45.320 --> 2:27:47.320]  I realize people are in a trance
[2:27:47.320 --> 2:27:49.320]  people are in a coma people just get comfortable
[2:27:49.320 --> 2:27:51.320]  they see their job they see their house
[2:27:51.320 --> 2:27:53.320]  their TV shows on everything seems normal
[2:27:53.320 --> 2:27:55.320]  it's kind of like
[2:27:55.320 --> 2:27:57.320]  one time I was like eight years old and I was in there
[2:27:57.320 --> 2:27:59.320]  watching a Christmas show I think it was a Christmas Carol
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:01.320]  my mom had ordered pizza
[2:28:01.320 --> 2:28:03.320]  she'd made brownies we might have one of pizza
[2:28:03.320 --> 2:28:05.320]  and we were sitting there at the coffee table watching TV
[2:28:05.320 --> 2:28:07.320]  and
[2:28:07.320 --> 2:28:09.320]  all of a sudden we see fire trucks
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:11.320]  and stuff pull up and the neighbor's house
[2:28:11.320 --> 2:28:13.320]  two doors down had flames like 50 feet
[2:28:13.320 --> 2:28:15.320]  I mean it was just engulfed in flame
[2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:17.320]  and the neighbors were coming down it was like
[2:28:17.320 --> 2:28:19.320]  week before Christmas and it's the same way
[2:28:19.320 --> 2:28:21.320]  it's like we're sitting here watching TV having a pizza
[2:28:21.320 --> 2:28:23.320]  and everything looks normal in our town
[2:28:23.320 --> 2:28:25.320]  in our city meanwhile the international order
[2:28:25.320 --> 2:28:27.320]  our own country our freedom
[2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:29.320]  everything's being burned down
[2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:31.320]  around us and so
[2:28:31.320 --> 2:28:33.320]  the fires coming our way
[2:28:33.320 --> 2:28:35.320]  we need to wake up to it and say no
[2:28:35.320 --> 2:28:37.320]  thank you Philip
[2:28:37.320 --> 2:28:39.320]  Andy and Kansas you're on the air thanks for holding
[2:28:41.320 --> 2:28:43.320]  so Alex I'm a first-time color I'm a huge fan
[2:28:43.320 --> 2:28:45.320]  I love your work I love you so much
[2:28:45.320 --> 2:28:47.320]  for what you do
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:49.320]  I've been sitting here
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:51.320]  just my brain's going a million miles an hour
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:53.320]  really quick
[2:28:53.320 --> 2:28:55.320]  we were originally in Minnesota
[2:28:55.320 --> 2:28:57.320]  we just got out of there we pulled our house
[2:28:57.320 --> 2:28:59.320]  put all our house and everything in storage
[2:28:59.320 --> 2:29:01.320]  I'm here living in a little house on wheels
[2:29:01.320 --> 2:29:03.320]  in the middle of Kansas
[2:29:03.320 --> 2:29:05.320]  I'm trying to get to Texas
[2:29:05.320 --> 2:29:07.320]  that's our goal
[2:29:07.320 --> 2:29:09.320]  but
[2:29:09.320 --> 2:29:11.320]  I'm a writer for a small
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:13.320]  website in Minnesota and I've been trying to fight
[2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:15.320]  on a local level
[2:29:15.320 --> 2:29:17.320]  a lot of the things that you talk about
[2:29:17.320 --> 2:29:19.320]  but it's the local crazies
[2:29:19.320 --> 2:29:21.320]  and in Minnesota you know
[2:29:21.320 --> 2:29:23.320]  it's nuts up there
[2:29:23.320 --> 2:29:25.320]  but what I'm calling about is the power grid thing
[2:29:25.320 --> 2:29:27.320]  because
[2:29:27.320 --> 2:29:29.320]  I had to get my brain to go
[2:29:29.320 --> 2:29:31.320]  it's okay Matt Bracken's coming on to talk about that
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:33.320]  so you can hold a few more minutes
[2:29:33.320 --> 2:29:35.320]  we'll talk to Matt it'll be the first color we go to
[2:29:35.320 --> 2:29:37.320]  and then I'm going to turn the fourth hour over to Matt Bracken
[2:29:37.320 --> 2:29:39.320]  but at the end of the fourth hour
[2:29:39.320 --> 2:29:41.320]  we're going to air something very special
[2:29:41.320 --> 2:29:43.320]  we're going to premiere something very special
[2:29:43.320 --> 2:29:45.320]  at the end of the fourth hour
[2:29:45.320 --> 2:29:47.320]  coming up in about an hour and 40 minutes from now
[2:29:47.320 --> 2:29:49.320]  we'll be back I'm Alex Jones
[2:29:49.320 --> 2:29:51.320]  we're on the march
[2:29:51.320 --> 2:29:53.320]  the empire is on the run
[2:29:53.320 --> 2:29:55.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:29:55.320 --> 2:29:57.320]  On New Year's Day
[2:29:57.320 --> 2:29:59.320]  in Kiev
[2:29:59.320 --> 2:30:01.320]  there was a torchlight procession
[2:30:01.320 --> 2:30:03.320]  the Ukrainian neo-Nazis were marching through
[2:30:03.320 --> 2:30:05.320]  the center of the capitol
[2:30:05.320 --> 2:30:07.320]  celebrating the birthday of Stepan Bandera
[2:30:07.320 --> 2:30:09.320]  the leader of the Ukrainian insurgent army
[2:30:09.320 --> 2:30:11.320]  who was also a Nazi sympathizer and a collaborator
[2:30:11.320 --> 2:30:13.320]  during World War II
[2:30:13.320 --> 2:30:15.320]  all the more reasons to be hailed as hero
[2:30:15.320 --> 2:30:17.320]  by the Maidan government
[2:30:17.320 --> 2:30:19.320]  the followers of Bandera
[2:30:19.320 --> 2:30:21.320]  proudly promoting Nazi slogans
[2:30:21.320 --> 2:30:23.320]  and the symbolics of the Third Reich
[2:30:23.320 --> 2:30:25.320]  hence their love for torchlight processions
[2:30:25.320 --> 2:30:27.320]  which were especially popular in Hitler's Germany
[2:30:27.320 --> 2:30:29.320]  the present day admirers of Bandera
[2:30:29.320 --> 2:30:31.320]  are deeply misled
[2:30:31.320 --> 2:30:33.320]  they glorify the myths given to them
[2:30:33.320 --> 2:30:35.320]  conveniently ignoring the facts of history
[2:30:35.320 --> 2:30:37.320]  repeated in present day Ukraine
[2:30:37.320 --> 2:30:39.320]  they murder their own countrymen under the guise of liberation
[2:30:39.320 --> 2:30:41.320]  of the people
[2:30:41.320 --> 2:30:43.320]  they murder their own ideological supporters
[2:30:43.320 --> 2:30:45.320]  who happen to choose a different leader
[2:30:45.320 --> 2:30:47.320]  and they call it fighting for their country's independence
[2:30:47.320 --> 2:30:49.320]  they murder and betray each other
[2:30:49.320 --> 2:30:51.320]  under the guise of unity and brotherhood
[2:30:51.320 --> 2:30:53.320]  the trail, the trail of your people
[2:30:53.320 --> 2:30:55.320]  and your country and the enemy within
[2:30:55.320 --> 2:30:57.320]  is more dangerous than any outside threat

[2:33:15.320 --> 2:33:17.320]  to turkey
[2:33:17.320 --> 2:33:19.320]  it is a big idea
[2:33:19.320 --> 2:33:21.320]  a new world order
[2:33:21.320 --> 2:33:23.320]  how is it that this organization
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:25.320]  is so well funded
[2:33:25.320 --> 2:33:27.320]  so organized?
[2:33:33.320 --> 2:33:35.320]  the leader of ISIS
[2:33:35.320 --> 2:33:37.320]  in Libya is none other than
[2:33:37.320 --> 2:33:39.320]  Abdel Hakim Bel-Haj
[2:33:39.320 --> 2:33:41.320]  and of course he was armed to the teeth
[2:33:41.320 --> 2:33:53.320]  a world in which there is the very real prospect of a new world order
[2:33:53.320 --> 2:33:57.320]  creating an ominous alliance against the United States
[2:33:57.320 --> 2:33:59.320]  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
[2:33:59.320 --> 2:34:01.320]  is aggressively opposing the nuclear deal
[2:34:01.320 --> 2:34:03.320]  that the US government is negotiating with Iran
[2:34:03.320 --> 2:34:05.320]  Saudi Arabia is apparently prepared
[2:34:05.320 --> 2:34:07.320]  to allow Israeli jets into its airspace
[2:34:07.320 --> 2:34:09.320]  to conduct attacks on Iran
[2:34:09.320 --> 2:34:11.320]  we have an unprecedented opportunity
[2:34:11.320 --> 2:34:13.320]  to build a new world order
[2:34:15.320 --> 2:34:17.320]  I set up a foundation in Ukraine
[2:34:17.320 --> 2:34:19.320]  and created an important part
[2:34:19.320 --> 2:34:21.320]  in events now
[2:34:21.320 --> 2:34:23.320]  Ukraine is set to receive the first tranche
[2:34:23.320 --> 2:34:25.320]  of international monetary fund aid package
[2:34:25.320 --> 2:34:27.320]  where we have broker the deal
[2:34:27.320 --> 2:34:29.320]  to transition power in Ukraine
[2:34:29.320 --> 2:34:31.320]  Vladimir Putin is on the move
[2:34:33.320 --> 2:34:35.320]  only when this transformation is complete
[2:34:35.320 --> 2:34:37.320]  will we be able to take full measure
[2:34:37.320 --> 2:34:39.320]  of the opportunities presented
[2:34:39.320 --> 2:34:41.320]  by this new
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:43.320]  and involving world order
[2:34:43.320 --> 2:34:45.320]  as well as the Bilderberg group
[2:34:45.320 --> 2:34:47.320]  could their objective be world domination?
[2:34:53.320 --> 2:34:55.320]  we're going to continue with Andy and Don
[2:34:55.320 --> 2:34:57.320]  and Chris and Nick's calls in the sour
[2:34:57.320 --> 2:34:59.320]  and then in the fourth hour Matt Bracken
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:01.320]  best selling author of former Navy SEAL
[2:35:01.320 --> 2:35:03.320]  really smart guy is going to be co-hosting
[2:35:03.320 --> 2:35:05.320]  the fourth hour
[2:35:05.320 --> 2:35:07.320]  I just thought today why am I going to host the fourth hour
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:09.320]  I should let Matt Bracken do it that way
[2:35:09.320 --> 2:35:11.320]  I'm not famously jumping and interrupting
[2:35:11.320 --> 2:35:13.320]  but the reason I do that is
[2:35:13.320 --> 2:35:15.320]  my brain
[2:35:15.320 --> 2:35:17.320]  just gets hammered with data
[2:35:17.320 --> 2:35:19.320]  and information it's like last week
[2:35:19.320 --> 2:35:21.320]  I thought where I first hear about fake news
[2:35:21.320 --> 2:35:23.320]  well Communist China did it to ban
[2:35:23.320 --> 2:35:25.320]  internet news and control things
[2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:27.320]  and kill people in mass
[2:35:27.320 --> 2:35:29.320]  arrest them kill them torture them
[2:35:29.320 --> 2:35:31.320]  in 96 but also in 2008
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:33.320]  when Obama got in
[2:35:33.320 --> 2:35:35.320]  Cass Sunstein wrote two papers
[2:35:35.320 --> 2:35:37.320]  at Chicago Business School
[2:35:37.320 --> 2:35:39.320]  in Harvard and gave those to Obama
[2:35:39.320 --> 2:35:41.320]  and promoted in government
[2:35:41.320 --> 2:35:43.320]  banning what they call fake news
[2:35:43.320 --> 2:35:45.320]  having a national censor finding people
[2:35:45.320 --> 2:35:47.320]  having internet IDs
[2:35:47.320 --> 2:35:49.320]  and internet social score and avatar
[2:35:49.320 --> 2:35:51.320]  which China has now adopted to track you
[2:35:51.320 --> 2:35:53.320]  and then control you
[2:35:53.320 --> 2:35:55.320]  that was passed into law
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:35:57.320]  two Friday nights ago nine days ago
[2:35:57.320 --> 2:35:59.320]  the night before Christmas Eve
[2:35:59.320 --> 2:36:01.320]  Friday night
[2:36:01.320 --> 2:36:03.320]  so they're moving full speed ahead
[2:36:03.320 --> 2:36:05.320]  now we were able to actually find this clip
[2:36:05.320 --> 2:36:07.320]  we usually can't
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:09.320]  because I remember the day that Bracken was on
[2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:11.320]  every time he's on the last few months he says
[2:36:11.320 --> 2:36:13.320]  I'm worried about a false flag on or before the inauguration
[2:36:13.320 --> 2:36:15.320]  of power grid out
[2:36:15.320 --> 2:36:17.320]  he's first trying to get into it and I jump in and say
[2:36:17.320 --> 2:36:19.320]  you mean they're going to blend the rush and she goes yeah of course
[2:36:19.320 --> 2:36:21.320]  but in previous breakdowns he's really gotten into it
[2:36:23.320 --> 2:36:25.320]  and then they came out on Friday and said
[2:36:25.320 --> 2:36:27.320]  they have hacked Vermont they tried to bring down the power grid
[2:36:27.320 --> 2:36:29.320]  McCain came out and said we need to have war with Russia
[2:36:29.320 --> 2:36:31.320]  I have the articles here
[2:36:31.320 --> 2:36:33.320]  and then we put out an article
[2:36:33.320 --> 2:36:35.320]  Merkel Thelen did exposing the whole thing
[2:36:35.320 --> 2:36:37.320]  and then the Forbes came out on Sunday
[2:36:37.320 --> 2:36:39.320]  and said fake news
[2:36:39.320 --> 2:36:41.320]  Washington Post
[2:36:41.320 --> 2:36:43.320]  forced to retract
[2:36:43.320 --> 2:36:45.320]  their Russia hacking a power grid story
[2:36:47.320 --> 2:36:49.320]  and we also again
[2:36:49.320 --> 2:36:51.320]  have
[2:36:51.320 --> 2:36:53.320]  the Associated Press others admitting Washington Post
[2:36:53.320 --> 2:36:55.320]  lost their fear
[2:36:55.320 --> 2:36:57.320]  of a false report of power grid hacked by Russia
[2:36:57.320 --> 2:36:59.320]  and then I started thinking
[2:36:59.320 --> 2:37:01.320]  they're just getting in our heads that it's going to be the Russians
[2:37:01.320 --> 2:37:03.320]  when this happens
[2:37:03.320 --> 2:37:05.320]  because this is the perfect thing according to Bracken and others
[2:37:05.320 --> 2:37:07.320]  and Bracken says oh I'm not that important
[2:37:07.320 --> 2:37:09.320]  I'm an ABC old counterterrorism Middle East
[2:37:09.320 --> 2:37:11.320]  oh I'm not that important a writer or anything blah blah
[2:37:11.320 --> 2:37:13.320]  but for my I've got really smart sources
[2:37:13.320 --> 2:37:15.320]  I didn't know who Bracken was like a year ago
[2:37:15.320 --> 2:37:17.320]  because I'm a busy guy there's so many great people out there
[2:37:17.320 --> 2:37:19.320]  I miss stuff
[2:37:19.320 --> 2:37:21.320]  and high level folks
[2:37:21.320 --> 2:37:23.320]  but you don't have Matt Bracken on his scenarios
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:25.320]  about TET2
[2:37:25.320 --> 2:37:27.320]  you name it or write on target
[2:37:27.320 --> 2:37:29.320]  and there's been a deal of pivot to the Muslims
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:31.320]  to not just use them to destabilize stuff Alex
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:33.320]  and then we've got an excuse to sell weapons
[2:37:33.320 --> 2:37:35.320]  no we're being double-crossed and so is Israel
[2:37:35.320 --> 2:37:37.320]  and I'm like really Israel's not going anywhere
[2:37:37.320 --> 2:37:39.320]  and they're like oh yeah
[2:37:39.320 --> 2:37:41.320]  they're going to remove the Israeli government
[2:37:41.320 --> 2:37:43.320]  we have quote the globalist have
[2:37:43.320 --> 2:37:45.320]  operatives inside there
[2:37:45.320 --> 2:37:47.320]  Netanyahu got SWAT team raided today
[2:37:47.320 --> 2:37:49.320]  the only message out is
[2:37:49.320 --> 2:37:51.320]  he says you know don't laugh so fast
[2:37:51.320 --> 2:37:53.320]  about your corruption charges
[2:37:53.320 --> 2:37:55.320]  they're saying he may be indicted
[2:37:55.320 --> 2:37:57.320]  this is an incredible time
[2:37:57.320 --> 2:37:59.320]  to be alive and why is that important
[2:37:59.320 --> 2:38:01.320]  whether you love Netanyahu or hate him
[2:38:01.320 --> 2:38:03.320]  a lot of leftist Hollywood
[2:38:03.320 --> 2:38:05.320]  Jews especially hate him when he's out of there
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:07.320]  because you know how dare him not let all the Muslims in
[2:38:07.320 --> 2:38:09.320]  who would kill him in a minute
[2:38:09.320 --> 2:38:11.320]  the point is he's siding with Trump and America
[2:38:11.320 --> 2:38:13.320]  and so whether you're Russia or Israel
[2:38:13.320 --> 2:38:15.320]  or the US or the UK
[2:38:15.320 --> 2:38:17.320]  anybody for nationalism and anybody for not being run
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:19.320]  by the big mega banks right ahead of their big collapse
[2:38:19.320 --> 2:38:21.320]  where they bring in total control
[2:38:21.320 --> 2:38:23.320]  is getting called a government or enemy
[2:38:23.320 --> 2:38:25.320]  you know of the state
[2:38:25.320 --> 2:38:27.320]  so you're being called
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:29.320]  government agent of Russia or Israel
[2:38:29.320 --> 2:38:31.320]  or you're being called enemy of the state
[2:38:31.320 --> 2:38:33.320]  this is what they do before giant wars
[2:38:33.320 --> 2:38:35.320]  all historians admit I mean all of them they're saying yeah
[2:38:35.320 --> 2:38:37.320]  this is pre-World War I type maneuvering
[2:38:37.320 --> 2:38:39.320]  and now they pass a law to shut down free speech
[2:38:39.320 --> 2:38:41.320]  they're doing all this
[2:38:41.320 --> 2:38:43.320]  17 days till Trump gets in
[2:38:43.320 --> 2:38:45.320]  I can tell you Trump knows the danger
[2:38:45.320 --> 2:38:47.320]  Trump knows the danger
[2:38:47.320 --> 2:38:49.320]  notice the Washington Post says
[2:38:49.320 --> 2:38:51.320]  Trump reading info wars will cause an economic collapse
[2:38:51.320 --> 2:38:53.320]  no raising interest rates will
[2:38:53.320 --> 2:38:55.320]  am I for zero interest rates
[2:38:55.320 --> 2:38:57.320]  no
[2:38:57.320 --> 2:38:59.320]  they only gave a zero interest rate to the big banks
[2:38:59.320 --> 2:39:01.320]  now we deserve some zero interest rates ourselves
[2:39:01.320 --> 2:39:03.320]  not forever and that's what Trump wants to do
[2:39:03.320 --> 2:39:05.320]  so they're trying to raise them to stall him
[2:39:05.320 --> 2:39:07.320]  the point is they're the ones involved
[2:39:07.320 --> 2:39:09.320]  trying to overthrow his election admitting they are
[2:39:09.320 --> 2:39:11.320]  and they still intend
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:13.320]  after the electors failed
[2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:15.320]  and after the recount failed
[2:39:15.320 --> 2:39:17.320]  and after all the failures
[2:39:17.320 --> 2:39:19.320]  they're going for broke and each time
[2:39:19.320 --> 2:39:21.320]  escalating
[2:39:21.320 --> 2:39:23.320]  all they've got is a fake indictment and fake arrest
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:25.320]  and having some
[2:39:25.320 --> 2:39:27.320]  crazy federal officers
[2:39:27.320 --> 2:39:29.320]  go in there and try this
[2:39:29.320 --> 2:39:31.320]  or loading a helicopter full of C-4
[2:39:31.320 --> 2:39:33.320]  and flying it into his home or Trump Tower
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:35.320]  or denigration but I'm telling you
[2:39:35.320 --> 2:39:37.320]  intellectually
[2:39:37.320 --> 2:39:39.320]  historically my sources but also gut level
[2:39:39.320 --> 2:39:41.320]  and that's what I really go with
[2:39:41.320 --> 2:39:43.320]  never I mean Spidey since
[2:39:43.320 --> 2:39:45.320]  let's say maybe it's gotten to death con 3
[2:39:45.320 --> 2:39:47.320]  we're at death con 1 folks
[2:39:47.320 --> 2:39:49.320]  okay so Matt Bracken
[2:39:49.320 --> 2:39:51.320]  I'll take a few calls and I'll hand it over to you
[2:39:51.320 --> 2:39:53.320]  but we have this clip of just last week
[2:39:53.320 --> 2:39:55.320]  there's even more detail clips before that
[2:39:55.320 --> 2:39:57.320]  where you laid out and I laid out
[2:39:57.320 --> 2:39:59.320]  this whole scenario and now we're seeing it
[2:39:59.320 --> 2:40:01.320]  what do you make of the situation
[2:40:01.320 --> 2:40:03.320]  we're in right now
[2:40:03.320 --> 2:40:05.320]  well the story in the Washington Post
[2:40:05.320 --> 2:40:07.320]  I think is huge
[2:40:07.320 --> 2:40:09.320]  you almost cannot over
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:11.320]  estimate how the Washington Post
[2:40:11.320 --> 2:40:13.320]  is being used by a conduit
[2:40:13.320 --> 2:40:15.320]  but I think that I'm actually
[2:40:15.320 --> 2:40:17.320]  a little bit optimistic because
[2:40:17.320 --> 2:40:19.320]  I think that they're still behind
[2:40:19.320 --> 2:40:21.320]  the curve you know they're still
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:23.320]  thinking that they're
[2:40:23.320 --> 2:40:25.320]  leading as the mainstream media
[2:40:25.320 --> 2:40:27.320]  but they're actually trailing now
[2:40:27.320 --> 2:40:29.320]  they're being
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:31.320]  outed so fast as fake news
[2:40:31.320 --> 2:40:33.320]  that their tricks aren't working
[2:40:33.320 --> 2:40:35.320]  like we said last week
[2:40:35.320 --> 2:40:37.320]  once you see the wizard behind the curtain
[2:40:37.320 --> 2:40:39.320]  you can't close the curtain
[2:40:39.320 --> 2:40:41.320]  and make us unsee it
[2:40:41.320 --> 2:40:43.320]  we've seen the wizard we know
[2:40:43.320 --> 2:40:45.320]  that the mainstream media is just
[2:40:45.320 --> 2:40:47.320]  feeding PsyOps propaganda
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:49.320]  the polls are nothing but propaganda
[2:40:49.320 --> 2:40:51.320]  right before the election
[2:40:51.320 --> 2:40:53.320]  Hillary up 12 points
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:55.320]  just propaganda and it's not working
[2:40:55.320 --> 2:40:57.320]  and when you see
[2:40:57.320 --> 2:40:59.320]  them trying to discredit Trump
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:01.320]  by associating him with infowars
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:03.320]  it just shows how far behind the curve
[2:41:03.320 --> 2:41:05.320]  they really are
[2:41:05.320 --> 2:41:07.320]  they're stuck in the old paradigm
[2:41:07.320 --> 2:41:09.320]  the paradigm that lost them the election
[2:41:09.320 --> 2:41:11.320]  but that doesn't make them less dangerous
[2:41:11.320 --> 2:41:13.320]  I was about to say yes everything
[2:41:13.320 --> 2:41:15.320]  they do turns to crap they have the opposite of a minus touch
[2:41:15.320 --> 2:41:17.320]  the problem is they're insane
[2:41:17.320 --> 2:41:19.320]  they're still in power they're escalating
[2:41:19.320 --> 2:41:21.320]  each threat continuum level
[2:41:21.320 --> 2:41:23.320]  I see this the math very easy
[2:41:23.320 --> 2:41:25.320]  it spells disaster
[2:41:25.320 --> 2:41:27.320]  I mean they're really going to go for broke
[2:41:27.320 --> 2:41:29.320]  well they're doubling down it's the old
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:31.320]  general honorary doubling down
[2:41:31.320 --> 2:41:33.320]  on stupid you know they've got
[2:41:33.320 --> 2:41:35.320]  no other trick they've only
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:37.320]  the only trick that they've got
[2:41:37.320 --> 2:41:39.320]  is to attack the alt right
[2:41:39.320 --> 2:41:41.320]  you know the conservative
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:43.320]  new media
[2:41:43.320 --> 2:41:45.320]  but they're so far behind the curve
[2:41:45.320 --> 2:41:47.320]  they don't realize they've already been left in the dust
[2:41:47.320 --> 2:41:49.320]  they become a laughing stock
[2:41:49.320 --> 2:41:51.320]  they are dinosaurs I mean Pelosi is like this
[2:41:51.320 --> 2:41:53.320]  reportedly Hillary everybody's falling apart
[2:41:53.320 --> 2:41:55.320]  Pelosi is like
[2:41:55.320 --> 2:41:57.320]  someone in command now
[2:41:57.320 --> 2:41:59.320]  of the opposition with Soros to doddering
[2:41:59.320 --> 2:42:01.320]  insane people
[2:42:01.320 --> 2:42:03.320]  Soros is definitely desperate
[2:42:03.320 --> 2:42:05.320]  Soros is seeing his entire castle
[2:42:05.320 --> 2:42:07.320]  crumbling before his eyes
[2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:09.320]  and like Pelosi and some of the others
[2:42:09.320 --> 2:42:11.320]  they're you know
[2:42:11.320 --> 2:42:13.320]  multiple procedures
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:15.320]  to keep them from showing their real age
[2:42:15.320 --> 2:42:17.320]  here's the next question the week before Hitler committed suicide
[2:42:17.320 --> 2:42:19.320]  he was giving orders to General Steiner
[2:42:19.320 --> 2:42:21.320]  who had one tent the force Hitler thought he had
[2:42:21.320 --> 2:42:23.320]  and was giving armies to
[2:42:23.320 --> 2:42:25.320]  you know orders to armies that were already destroyed
[2:42:25.320 --> 2:42:27.320]  have we reached that point where they're kind of just giving like
[2:42:27.320 --> 2:42:29.320]  they're giving orders to their legs
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:31.320]  off or
[2:42:31.320 --> 2:42:33.320]  could they really try to start a war or something before
[2:42:33.320 --> 2:42:35.320]  they're removed because I know the intelligence agencies
[2:42:35.320 --> 2:42:37.320]  I don't lionize them but they are
[2:42:37.320 --> 2:42:39.320]  more awake than the average person and they're really blocking
[2:42:39.320 --> 2:42:41.320]  what's happening well the intelligence
[2:42:41.320 --> 2:42:43.320]  agencies but at the top you know
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:45.320]  Clapper and Brennan I don't trust
[2:42:45.320 --> 2:42:47.320]  at all as far as I'm concerned
[2:42:47.320 --> 2:42:49.320]  they're moles you know as far as
[2:42:49.320 --> 2:42:51.320]  I'm concerned they lean more towards traitor than patriot
[2:42:51.320 --> 2:42:53.320]  no I totally agree but we know with US intelligence
[2:42:53.320 --> 2:42:55.320]  that leaked the infos what I'm saying
[2:42:55.320 --> 2:42:57.320]  that's their number one concern
[2:42:57.320 --> 2:42:59.320]  well
[2:42:59.320 --> 2:43:01.320]  in the next three weeks we could definitely
[2:43:01.320 --> 2:43:03.320]  see something you know a
[2:43:03.320 --> 2:43:05.320]  real a true crisis say
[2:43:05.320 --> 2:43:07.320]  you know a chemical attack in Israel
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:09.320]  something like that
[2:43:09.320 --> 2:43:11.320]  I would put nothing off of the cable
[2:43:11.320 --> 2:43:13.320]  how big is it they're moving against Netanyahu
[2:43:13.320 --> 2:43:15.320]  I mean Obama wouldn't have moved against Netanyahu
[2:43:15.320 --> 2:43:17.320]  last week if he didn't have something he thought
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:19.320]  that was big and now we know they're trying
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:21.320]  to indict and arrest Netanyahu police are at his house
[2:43:21.320 --> 2:43:23.320]  right now but it's it's so
[2:43:23.320 --> 2:43:25.320]  patently obvious
[2:43:25.320 --> 2:43:27.320]  that's the thing it's so obvious
[2:43:27.320 --> 2:43:29.320]  that this is Obama and Soros
[2:43:29.320 --> 2:43:31.320]  is desperation move this is
[2:43:31.320 --> 2:43:33.320]  they're going out the door trying to
[2:43:33.320 --> 2:43:35.320]  you know I totally agree so
[2:43:35.320 --> 2:43:37.320]  so what other moves do you think they have because you brought up
[2:43:37.320 --> 2:43:39.320]  the grid situation and then it popped
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:41.320]  right out
[2:43:41.320 --> 2:43:43.320]  yeah and and see
[2:43:43.320 --> 2:43:45.320]  this is really important this is why my
[2:43:45.320 --> 2:43:47.320]  first novel enemies foreign and domestic begins
[2:43:47.320 --> 2:43:49.320]  with a false flag operation
[2:43:49.320 --> 2:43:51.320]  and for the purpose of putting
[2:43:51.320 --> 2:43:53.320]  in people's minds that don't always believe
[2:43:53.320 --> 2:43:55.320]  you know the obvious story that you see
[2:43:55.320 --> 2:43:57.320]  in the newspaper on TV
[2:43:57.320 --> 2:43:59.320]  there can be other reasons other things behind it
[2:43:59.320 --> 2:44:01.320]  we're now at the point where any kind
[2:44:01.320 --> 2:44:03.320]  of a partial grid collapse in this country
[2:44:03.320 --> 2:44:05.320]  people wouldn't both think that it was
[2:44:05.320 --> 2:44:07.320]  Russia doing it they would think it was
[2:44:07.320 --> 2:44:09.320]  Obama doing it and Brennan
[2:44:09.320 --> 2:44:11.320]  and Clapper and you know the other Confederates
[2:44:11.320 --> 2:44:13.320]  that they have but they're so just connected
[2:44:13.320 --> 2:44:15.320]  as you just said they may do it
[2:44:15.320 --> 2:44:17.320]  they may but it
[2:44:17.320 --> 2:44:19.320]  but it's you know there's going
[2:44:19.320 --> 2:44:21.320]  to be a new sheriff in town and the friends
[2:44:21.320 --> 2:44:23.320]  will still be around
[2:44:23.320 --> 2:44:25.320]  your guts telling you that we've turned the tide
[2:44:25.320 --> 2:44:27.320]  then
[2:44:27.320 --> 2:44:29.320]  I hope so that doesn't mean that they won't try
[2:44:29.320 --> 2:44:31.320]  something desperate but what's your gut tell
[2:44:31.320 --> 2:44:33.320]  you this I mean
[2:44:33.320 --> 2:44:35.320]  my gut tells me that something
[2:44:35.320 --> 2:44:37.320]  you know outrageous could happen in
[2:44:37.320 --> 2:44:39.320]  in the next three weeks yeah that's what my
[2:44:39.320 --> 2:44:41.320]  I don't know that if it's going to I don't know
[2:44:41.320 --> 2:44:43.320]  it's going to stop the inauguration
[2:44:43.320 --> 2:44:45.320]  and the worst the worst actions
[2:44:45.320 --> 2:44:47.320]  that they take at this point all of the
[2:44:47.320 --> 2:44:49.320]  forensics you know the cyber
[2:44:49.320 --> 2:44:51.320]  forensics will be preserved
[2:44:51.320 --> 2:44:53.320]  and when the new team comes in
[2:44:53.320 --> 2:44:55.320]  people will be facing prison for any kind
[2:44:55.320 --> 2:44:57.320]  of you know well I agree you know there's
[2:44:57.320 --> 2:44:59.320]  been this thing don't don't go after the last group
[2:44:59.320 --> 2:45:01.320]  and we'll leave you alone Trump has to just
[2:45:01.320 --> 2:45:03.320]  a part of duty has to purge
[2:45:03.320 --> 2:45:05.320]  these people we have I mean thousands of
[2:45:05.320 --> 2:45:07.320]  people have to get indicted and go to prison bare minimum
[2:45:07.320 --> 2:45:09.320]  well I like
[2:45:09.320 --> 2:45:11.320]  the fact that you know if if Jeff
[2:45:11.320 --> 2:45:13.320]  Sessions is indeed approved
[2:45:13.320 --> 2:45:15.320]  I think that there are probably
[2:45:15.320 --> 2:45:17.320]  you know dozens
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:19.320]  of nests of FBI
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:21.320]  agents with plenty of integrity
[2:45:21.320 --> 2:45:23.320]  they've been keeping their
[2:45:23.320 --> 2:45:25.320]  their private file all along
[2:45:25.320 --> 2:45:27.320]  oh yeah the FBI New York has all the
[2:45:27.320 --> 2:45:29.320]  pedophile stuff yeah well not only the
[2:45:29.320 --> 2:45:31.320]  pedophile stuff but I mean all of the
[2:45:31.320 --> 2:45:33.320]  all of the pay to play for Hillary at the
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:35.320]  State Department you know all of these things
[2:45:35.320 --> 2:45:37.320]  they're there they tried to bribe them
[2:45:37.320 --> 2:45:39.320]  on tape three different groups
[2:45:39.320 --> 2:45:41.320]  of FBI they would bribe them on the spot
[2:45:41.320 --> 2:45:43.320]  and they would say the FBI would say came
[2:45:43.320 --> 2:45:45.320]  on WikiLeaks and in the congressional hearing
[2:45:45.320 --> 2:45:47.320]  as you know they'd say this is illegal
[2:45:47.320 --> 2:45:49.320]  they go no we've been given authorization
[2:45:49.320 --> 2:45:51.320]  by the Secretary of State to make these
[2:45:51.320 --> 2:45:53.320]  offers of jobs if you'll drop
[2:45:53.320 --> 2:45:55.320]  this I mean talk about arrogance Matt
[2:45:55.320 --> 2:45:57.320]  well just wait until
[2:45:57.320 --> 2:45:59.320]  wait until the new regime is in power
[2:45:59.320 --> 2:46:01.320]  and these FBI agents
[2:46:01.320 --> 2:46:03.320]  that were told to stand down that have been
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:05.320]  you know grinding their teeth for the last
[2:46:05.320 --> 2:46:07.320]  year and a half but
[2:46:07.320 --> 2:46:09.320]  meanwhile they've been still continuing their
[2:46:09.320 --> 2:46:11.320]  investigations because that's what they do
[2:46:11.320 --> 2:46:13.320]  these senior investigators it's in their
[2:46:13.320 --> 2:46:15.320]  bone marrow
[2:46:15.320 --> 2:46:17.320]  telling them to stand down just makes
[2:46:17.320 --> 2:46:19.320]  them dig in harder like trying to pull
[2:46:19.320 --> 2:46:21.320]  a bone away from a mad pit bull
[2:46:21.320 --> 2:46:23.320]  you know you can order the pit bull to
[2:46:23.320 --> 2:46:25.320]  drop the bone but he's just going to hide
[2:46:25.320 --> 2:46:27.320]  it and you know you're not going to take
[2:46:27.320 --> 2:46:29.320]  it away from them and these investigators
[2:46:29.320 --> 2:46:31.320]  I think that they're going to put files
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:33.320]  that are practically complete in front
[2:46:33.320 --> 2:46:35.320]  of Jeff Sessions then it'll be between
[2:46:35.320 --> 2:46:37.320]  DOJ and President Trump
[2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:39.320]  I agree no Trump Trump is actually going to go
[2:46:39.320 --> 2:46:41.320]  after him they know that I don't know
[2:46:41.320 --> 2:46:43.320]  why Trump's in a double game that acting
[2:46:43.320 --> 2:46:45.320]  conciliatory in public when he's playing to go after
[2:46:45.320 --> 2:46:47.320]  him when they already know
[2:46:47.320 --> 2:46:49.320]  well he has to act conciliatory in public
[2:46:49.320 --> 2:46:51.320]  because you know you don't want to
[2:46:51.320 --> 2:46:53.320]  warn the person that is still
[2:46:53.320 --> 2:46:55.320]  got the nuclear football being carried around
[2:46:55.320 --> 2:46:57.320]  behind him you know you don't want to
[2:46:57.320 --> 2:46:59.320]  overtly warn the guy in the open
[2:46:59.320 --> 2:47:01.320]  that you know you might be facing
[2:47:01.320 --> 2:47:03.320]  prison time no I agree but they know
[2:47:03.320 --> 2:47:05.320]  it's bull
[2:47:05.320 --> 2:47:07.320]  I don't know I mean they've got to be
[2:47:07.320 --> 2:47:09.320]  desperate now you know Obama
[2:47:09.320 --> 2:47:11.320]  I don't I think
[2:47:11.320 --> 2:47:13.320]  he could even leave the country I mean
[2:47:13.320 --> 2:47:15.320]  come to it but
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:17.320]  I think a lot a lot will be
[2:47:17.320 --> 2:47:19.320]  exposed remember Trump
[2:47:19.320 --> 2:47:21.320]  was also and you know this is where
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:23.320]  the mainstream media they try to
[2:47:23.320 --> 2:47:25.320]  they try to discredit all of these along with
[2:47:25.320 --> 2:47:27.320]  say pizza gate things like that
[2:47:27.320 --> 2:47:29.320]  find one false allegation in a
[2:47:29.320 --> 2:47:31.320]  you know a thousand reddit replies
[2:47:31.320 --> 2:47:33.320]  and discredit the entire actual
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:35.320]  conspiracy but Trump
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:37.320]  never did believe the Obama
[2:47:37.320 --> 2:47:39.320]  background fiction
[2:47:39.320 --> 2:47:41.320]  personally I think he was born
[2:47:41.320 --> 2:47:43.320]  in Hawaii but just his father was probably
[2:47:43.320 --> 2:47:45.320]  Frank Marshall Davis that's a hundred
[2:47:45.320 --> 2:47:47.320]  percent of the book and made the movie
[2:47:47.320 --> 2:47:49.320]  hundred percent it's his photos of him in
[2:47:49.320 --> 2:47:51.320]  the same couch same house it's in his
[2:47:51.320 --> 2:47:53.320]  book his grandfather was CIA
[2:47:53.320 --> 2:47:55.320]  admitted Davis was quote like his dad
[2:47:55.320 --> 2:47:57.320]  he stayed there the summers and then
[2:47:57.320 --> 2:47:59.320]  well yeah a
[2:47:59.320 --> 2:48:01.320]  pornographer and a pedophile that's right
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:03.320]  you know who swung with who swung
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:05.320]  both ways imagine him as the
[2:48:05.320 --> 2:48:07.320]  as the
[2:48:07.320 --> 2:48:09.320]  mentor to your teenage boy
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:11.320]  as you know since you've seen to know about
[2:48:11.320 --> 2:48:13.320]  this it's well documented
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:15.320]  Davis is one of the head communists
[2:48:15.320 --> 2:48:17.320]  using sex crimes and sex infiltrators
[2:48:17.320 --> 2:48:19.320]  to try to infiltrate and take over
[2:48:19.320 --> 2:48:21.320]  the Democratic Party in black groups
[2:48:21.320 --> 2:48:23.320]  he ran newspapers all over the country he was
[2:48:23.320 --> 2:48:25.320]  actually got direct orders from the
[2:48:25.320 --> 2:48:27.320]  Politburo so the father
[2:48:27.320 --> 2:48:29.320]  of Obama was a one of the highest level
[2:48:29.320 --> 2:48:31.320]  Soviet spies in this country for 30 years
[2:48:31.320 --> 2:48:33.320]  right and to me it's
[2:48:33.320 --> 2:48:35.320]  this is this is um
[2:48:35.320 --> 2:48:37.320]  it's hard not to think that we must be
[2:48:37.320 --> 2:48:39.320]  in some kind of an end time or
[2:48:39.320 --> 2:48:41.320]  fourth turning or whatever you want to call it
[2:48:41.320 --> 2:48:43.320]  because to me it's
[2:48:43.320 --> 2:48:45.320]  like the plot of rosemary's baby
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:47.320]  or one of these or one of these
[2:48:47.320 --> 2:48:49.320]  uh uh Damien
[2:48:49.320 --> 2:48:51.320]  movies you know it's you've
[2:48:51.320 --> 2:48:53.320]  got the baby of uh
[2:48:53.320 --> 2:48:55.320]  you know the left Lucifer and the
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:48:57.320]  Islam Lucifer becoming president of the
[2:48:57.320 --> 2:48:59.320]  United States if you
[2:48:59.320 --> 2:49:01.320]  if you if you submitted that
[2:49:01.320 --> 2:49:03.320]  to Hollywood they would think it was
[2:49:03.320 --> 2:49:05.320]  outrageous but it happened who first said
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:07.320]  true you're a writer who first said truth
[2:49:07.320 --> 2:49:09.320]  stranger the fiction because it is
[2:49:09.320 --> 2:49:11.320]  absolutely there it's it's frequent
[2:49:11.320 --> 2:49:13.320]  that coincidences happen
[2:49:13.320 --> 2:49:15.320]  and I say I could never put that in a book
[2:49:15.320 --> 2:49:17.320]  it's just not believable but they actually
[2:49:17.320 --> 2:49:19.320]  do happen I mean they really are
[2:49:19.320 --> 2:49:21.320]  let me ask this question
[2:49:21.320 --> 2:49:23.320]  I'll take a few phone calls and hand this over to you
[2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:25.320]  I want to play this clip from last week where you predicted the whole
[2:49:25.320 --> 2:49:27.320]  power plant thing and they start rolling that out
[2:49:27.320 --> 2:49:29.320]  and they clearly better testing it
[2:49:29.320 --> 2:49:31.320]  what I don't get it
[2:49:31.320 --> 2:49:33.320]  they conquered America the globalist they run
[2:49:33.320 --> 2:49:35.320]  it why then kill the prosperity
[2:49:35.320 --> 2:49:37.320]  go after people and wreck it
[2:49:37.320 --> 2:49:39.320]  all when they're in charge of it it's
[2:49:39.320 --> 2:49:41.320]  crazy well it's
[2:49:41.320 --> 2:49:43.320]  it's like World War two when
[2:49:43.320 --> 2:49:45.320]  the Germans are are
[2:49:45.320 --> 2:49:47.320]  at the knocking at the door of
[2:49:47.320 --> 2:49:49.320]  Moscow and Stalingrad
[2:49:49.320 --> 2:49:51.320]  it looks like you're on the verge of
[2:49:51.320 --> 2:49:53.320]  complete victory and annihilation
[2:49:53.320 --> 2:49:55.320]  of your enemies but really the
[2:49:55.320 --> 2:49:57.320]  wave has gone all the way up the beach as far
[2:49:57.320 --> 2:49:59.320]  as it's going to go
[2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:01.320]  and that's from then on
[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:03.320]  it's on the way out so
[2:50:03.320 --> 2:50:05.320]  the globalists are looking at
[2:50:05.320 --> 2:50:07.320]  Brexit and then Trump
[2:50:07.320 --> 2:50:09.320]  and now a slew of
[2:50:09.320 --> 2:50:11.320]  elections coming up in Europe
[2:50:11.320 --> 2:50:13.320]  and the globalists are going to be
[2:50:13.320 --> 2:50:15.320]  trounced and we're
[2:50:15.320 --> 2:50:17.320]  now in the post-Moscow
[2:50:17.320 --> 2:50:19.320]  post-Stalingrad phase of World War
[2:50:19.320 --> 2:50:21.320]  two where they get beaten
[2:50:21.320 --> 2:50:23.320]  all the way back I use
[2:50:23.320 --> 2:50:25.320]  that analogy constantly because it's so true
[2:50:25.320 --> 2:50:27.320]  they've put all their energy
[2:50:27.320 --> 2:50:29.320]  and everything in and now just like a wave
[2:50:29.320 --> 2:50:31.320]  going back everything's reversing
[2:50:31.320 --> 2:50:33.320]  and historically as you know these are
[2:50:33.320 --> 2:50:35.320]  hundred year waves they've got
[2:50:35.320 --> 2:50:37.320]  a hundred years of being backpedaling
[2:50:37.320 --> 2:50:39.320]  now and they finally get it
[2:50:39.320 --> 2:50:41.320]  I think this is a grand super cycle
[2:50:41.320 --> 2:50:43.320]  I think a Kondratiev
[2:50:43.320 --> 2:50:45.320]  cycle which is you know enough generations
[2:50:45.320 --> 2:50:47.320]  that nobody remembers
[2:50:47.320 --> 2:50:49.320]  the last big you know great
[2:50:49.320 --> 2:50:51.320]  this is a mega quickening
[2:50:51.320 --> 2:50:53.320]  this is a millennial cycle
[2:50:53.320 --> 2:50:55.320]  I think this would this would have to be
[2:50:55.320 --> 2:50:57.320]  considered a super cycle I agree
[2:50:57.320 --> 2:50:59.320]  and the enemy I mean have you read all
[2:50:59.320 --> 2:51:01.320]  their writings to their own people because they think
[2:51:01.320 --> 2:51:03.320]  we're dumb and don't read you know editorials
[2:51:03.320 --> 2:51:05.320]  he puts out Soros or Financial Times
[2:51:05.320 --> 2:51:07.320]  they admit everything's destroyed it's over
[2:51:07.320 --> 2:51:09.320]  oh my god they're going to hang us red alert
[2:51:09.320 --> 2:51:11.320]  I mean they are in panic mode right now
[2:51:11.320 --> 2:51:13.320]  and remember they do
[2:51:13.320 --> 2:51:15.320]  believe that they have parachutes
[2:51:15.320 --> 2:51:17.320]  this makes them very dangerous because
[2:51:17.320 --> 2:51:19.320]  they personally think
[2:51:19.320 --> 2:51:21.320]  that no matter what happens
[2:51:21.320 --> 2:51:23.320]  they can jump on their Gulfstream
[2:51:23.320 --> 2:51:25.320]  and fly to Patagonia
[2:51:25.320 --> 2:51:27.320]  or to New Zealand or one of the other places
[2:51:27.320 --> 2:51:29.320]  where they have a you know in a state
[2:51:29.320 --> 2:51:31.320]  with five years worth of generator
[2:51:31.320 --> 2:51:33.320]  they have armored redoubts
[2:51:33.320 --> 2:51:35.320]  so they think that no matter what they get away
[2:51:35.320 --> 2:51:37.320]  so that makes them
[2:51:37.320 --> 2:51:39.320]  dangerous in a sense that you know
[2:51:39.320 --> 2:51:41.320]  a family man nobody
[2:51:41.320 --> 2:51:43.320]  living in a city or the suburbs
[2:51:43.320 --> 2:51:45.320]  actually wants to see
[2:51:45.320 --> 2:51:47.320]  the grid go down chaos
[2:51:47.320 --> 2:51:49.320]  and cannibalism but the elites hate the public
[2:51:49.320 --> 2:51:51.320]  and they even talk about it and get off on it
[2:51:51.320 --> 2:51:53.320]  but here's what they don't get
[2:51:53.320 --> 2:51:55.320]  literally the most hardcore group
[2:51:55.320 --> 2:51:57.320]  most patriotic most anti-neural order
[2:51:57.320 --> 2:51:59.320]  is the soldiers and the best of those
[2:51:59.320 --> 2:52:01.320]  are the security people
[2:52:01.320 --> 2:52:03.320]  I don't know of security people that don't hate
[2:52:03.320 --> 2:52:05.320]  every one of them and basically have a deck of cards
[2:52:05.320 --> 2:52:07.320]  wanting to kill them don't they get that as soon as
[2:52:07.320 --> 2:52:09.320]  they have this nuclear war scenario
[2:52:09.320 --> 2:52:11.320]  and they're in a bunker that day one
[2:52:11.320 --> 2:52:13.320]  the security guys are going to walk in and say
[2:52:13.320 --> 2:52:15.320]  sorry we're going to kill you right now
[2:52:15.320 --> 2:52:17.320]  and by the way your family
[2:52:17.320 --> 2:52:19.320]  I mean I'm sorry
[2:52:19.320 --> 2:52:21.320]  well and it's not only the active duty
[2:52:21.320 --> 2:52:23.320]  and the actively employed security guys
[2:52:23.320 --> 2:52:25.320]  I would say everybody
[2:52:25.320 --> 2:52:27.320]  from approximately the Vietnam
[2:52:27.320 --> 2:52:29.320]  just in terms of age
[2:52:29.320 --> 2:52:31.320]  everybody from the Vietnam generation
[2:52:31.320 --> 2:52:33.320]  on
[2:52:33.320 --> 2:52:35.320]  when they have nothing to lose don't these globalists realize
[2:52:35.320 --> 2:52:37.320]  that they're going to have like 10 million
[2:52:37.320 --> 2:52:39.320]  soldiers coming after them
[2:52:39.320 --> 2:52:41.320]  well it's much it's even more than that
[2:52:41.320 --> 2:52:43.320]  because
[2:52:43.320 --> 2:52:45.320]  we've been world leaders
[2:52:45.320 --> 2:52:47.320]  at training guerrillas
[2:52:47.320 --> 2:52:49.320]  I mean the special forces mission
[2:52:49.320 --> 2:52:51.320]  the green berets
[2:52:51.320 --> 2:52:53.320]  the army special forces their bread and butter
[2:52:53.320 --> 2:52:55.320]  mission is to go into a place
[2:52:55.320 --> 2:52:57.320]  and train guerrillas
[2:52:57.320 --> 2:52:59.320]  well you take one
[2:52:59.320 --> 2:53:01.320]  green beret I don't care if he's 60
[2:53:01.320 --> 2:53:03.320]  or if he's 26
[2:53:03.320 --> 2:53:05.320]  you take one green beret and a Boy Scout troop
[2:53:05.320 --> 2:53:07.320]  and in a month
[2:53:07.320 --> 2:53:09.320]  you've got a guerrilla platoon
[2:53:09.320 --> 2:53:11.320]  so it's much more than the individual
[2:53:11.320 --> 2:53:13.320]  former
[2:53:13.320 --> 2:53:15.320]  guy or infantry
[2:53:15.320 --> 2:53:17.320]  airborne ranger I agree but I'm saying
[2:53:17.320 --> 2:53:19.320]  the very security
[2:53:19.320 --> 2:53:21.320]  of all these people literally hate their guts
[2:53:21.320 --> 2:53:23.320]  including the pilots
[2:53:23.320 --> 2:53:25.320]  you know when
[2:53:25.320 --> 2:53:27.320]  they don't they don't fly their own jets
[2:53:27.320 --> 2:53:29.320]  very few exceptions oh that's another point I don't know
[2:53:29.320 --> 2:53:31.320]  a pilot that isn't a pilot's role
[2:53:31.320 --> 2:53:33.320]  ex-Navian Air Force
[2:53:33.320 --> 2:53:35.320]  their pilots might turn
[2:53:35.320 --> 2:53:37.320]  around and land them
[2:53:37.320 --> 2:53:39.320]  at a secure facility in Omaha instead of flying
[2:53:39.320 --> 2:53:41.320]  to Patagonia something they might want to think about
[2:53:41.320 --> 2:53:43.320]  and by the way Matt Bracken
[2:53:43.320 --> 2:53:45.320]  we're not just saying this to feel good
[2:53:45.320 --> 2:53:47.320]  I mean we're really telling the truth right now
[2:53:47.320 --> 2:53:49.320]  so that's why it's important I mean when I hear the way
[2:53:49.320 --> 2:53:51.320]  Soros and Hillary
[2:53:51.320 --> 2:53:53.320]  treat their security people
[2:53:53.320 --> 2:53:55.320]  I mean they treat them like
[2:53:55.320 --> 2:53:57.320]  it's even on top of it they treat them like filth
[2:53:57.320 --> 2:53:59.320]  they have no idea what's going to happen to them
[2:53:59.320 --> 2:54:01.320]  well it's not when you say security
[2:54:01.320 --> 2:54:03.320]  I'm thinking
[2:54:03.320 --> 2:54:05.320]  military ex-military
[2:54:05.320 --> 2:54:07.320]  former military no that's who they have
[2:54:07.320 --> 2:54:09.320]  sure it's like it's like blackwater type people
[2:54:09.320 --> 2:54:11.320]  right and you know in Benghazi
[2:54:11.320 --> 2:54:13.320]  the 13 hours thing
[2:54:13.320 --> 2:54:15.320]  the SEAL community
[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:17.320]  counts the former SEAL as a SEAL
[2:54:17.320 --> 2:54:19.320]  he's not a guy
[2:54:19.320 --> 2:54:21.320]  who just used to be a SEAL
[2:54:21.320 --> 2:54:23.320]  he's considered a SEAL
[2:54:23.320 --> 2:54:25.320]  doing his duty now he's working for the CIA
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:27.320]  or he might be working private security
[2:54:27.320 --> 2:54:29.320]  for the State Department what have you
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:31.320]  but these guys
[2:54:31.320 --> 2:54:33.320]  former and active
[2:54:33.320 --> 2:54:35.320]  they still have that military ethos
[2:54:35.320 --> 2:54:37.320]  and they do take their oath very seriously
[2:54:37.320 --> 2:54:39.320]  the oath to defend the Constitution
[2:54:39.320 --> 2:54:41.320]  against all enemies foreign and domestic
[2:54:41.320 --> 2:54:43.320]  so these and
[2:54:43.320 --> 2:54:45.320]  this goes doubly for the pilots
[2:54:45.320 --> 2:54:47.320]  you know you don't just come out of
[2:54:47.320 --> 2:54:49.320]  Emory Riddle flight school
[2:54:49.320 --> 2:54:51.320]  and go fly golf streams for George Soros
[2:54:51.320 --> 2:54:53.320]  you know the guy that is flying
[2:54:53.320 --> 2:54:55.320]  for George Soros might hate his guts
[2:54:55.320 --> 2:54:57.320]  he might be an ex-air force guy
[2:54:57.320 --> 2:54:59.320]  and when it comes time to fly him to Patagonia
[2:54:59.320 --> 2:55:01.320]  the plane might land inside
[2:55:01.320 --> 2:55:03.320]  of area 51 you know
[2:55:03.320 --> 2:55:05.320]  surrounded by you know
[2:55:05.320 --> 2:55:07.320]  white air force pickup trucks
[2:55:07.320 --> 2:55:09.320]  so it's something that these people
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:11.320]  that have a golf stream escape plan
[2:55:11.320 --> 2:55:13.320]  should really think about the loyalty
[2:55:13.320 --> 2:55:15.320]  of their pilots when they get in that airplane
[2:55:15.320 --> 2:55:17.320]  by the way we're not just saying this
[2:55:17.320 --> 2:55:19.320]  we just kicked their ass all over the world
[2:55:19.320 --> 2:55:21.320]  in the last year don't they get
[2:55:21.320 --> 2:55:23.320]  that the move is happening
[2:55:23.320 --> 2:55:25.320]  this is the counter offensive
[2:55:25.320 --> 2:55:27.320]  we're winning every battle
[2:55:27.320 --> 2:55:29.320]  and they think they're going to double down against us
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:31.320]  and beat us I agree we're going to beat them
[2:55:31.320 --> 2:55:33.320]  I just hope they don't start a nuclear war
[2:55:33.320 --> 2:55:35.320]  that's right and but
[2:55:35.320 --> 2:55:37.320]  I'm heartened by this Washington Post
[2:55:37.320 --> 2:55:39.320]  article because it's
[2:55:39.320 --> 2:55:41.320]  it's so
[2:55:41.320 --> 2:55:43.320]  it's such a false note it's a puny
[2:55:43.320 --> 2:55:45.320]  it's like a little counter attack
[2:55:45.320 --> 2:55:47.320]  you know even in the
[2:55:47.320 --> 2:55:49.320]  spring of 45
[2:55:49.320 --> 2:55:51.320]  you know after the Battle of the Bulge
[2:55:51.320 --> 2:55:53.320]  you know in the Hurtgen Forest
[2:55:53.320 --> 2:55:55.320]  and all of it the Germans were still
[2:55:55.320 --> 2:55:57.320]  capable of launching small counter
[2:55:57.320 --> 2:55:59.320]  attacks back in the bunker
[2:55:59.320 --> 2:56:01.320]  Hitler's thinking that these are actually
[2:56:01.320 --> 2:56:03.320]  going to work you know the German generals
[2:56:03.320 --> 2:56:05.320]  didn't think they were going to work they were just going
[2:56:05.320 --> 2:56:07.320]  okay well that's you know
[2:56:07.320 --> 2:56:09.320]  the Americans have left us an opening
[2:56:09.320 --> 2:56:11.320]  we'll attack but
[2:56:11.320 --> 2:56:13.320]  this pitiful little Washington Post
[2:56:13.320 --> 2:56:15.320]  grid down scenario story is such
[2:56:15.320 --> 2:56:17.320]  an obvious fake fake news
[2:56:17.320 --> 2:56:19.320]  story it was debunked so quickly
[2:56:19.320 --> 2:56:21.320]  now they've just like with my story
[2:56:21.320 --> 2:56:23.320]  about the shooting into the stadium
[2:56:23.320 --> 2:56:25.320]  my first novel they've taken
[2:56:25.320 --> 2:56:27.320]  grid down off of their playbook
[2:56:27.320 --> 2:56:29.320]  it wouldn't work now it's too
[2:56:29.320 --> 2:56:31.320]  the you just said it that's why
[2:56:31.320 --> 2:56:33.320]  we're that's why we're harping on it
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:35.320]  Matt is to take it off the table
[2:56:35.320 --> 2:56:37.320]  that's right we take it off the table
[2:56:37.320 --> 2:56:39.320]  nobody would believe it it would we'd
[2:56:39.320 --> 2:56:41.320]  say we'd say they'd say
[2:56:41.320 --> 2:56:43.320]  Putin and we'd say Obama and Soros
[2:56:43.320 --> 2:56:45.320]  but that's why the listeners still have to get this out
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:47.320]  we've got to point out that Drudge
[2:56:47.320 --> 2:56:49.320]  carried our article gets a lot of the credit it's not about
[2:56:49.320 --> 2:56:51.320]  credit we didn't know the conduits we've got
[2:56:51.320 --> 2:56:53.320]  within 24 hours it was all over the news it was
[2:56:53.320 --> 2:56:55.320]  fake and it was MSM saying
[2:56:55.320 --> 2:56:57.320]  Washington Post you're fake
[2:56:57.320 --> 2:56:59.320]  I love seeing them eat their own
[2:56:59.320 --> 2:57:01.320]  which shows a lot of MSMs getting it
[2:57:01.320 --> 2:57:03.320]  hey we're betting on the wrong team
[2:57:03.320 --> 2:57:05.320]  how long until that metric hits
[2:57:05.320 --> 2:57:07.320]  and we see a almost total conversion
[2:57:07.320 --> 2:57:09.320]  of their own people
[2:57:09.320 --> 2:57:11.320]  I'm I don't know I think
[2:57:11.320 --> 2:57:13.320]  we've seen a few but I mean
[2:57:13.320 --> 2:57:15.320]  you know Politico still has Glenn Thrush
[2:57:15.320 --> 2:57:17.320]  he's still going on NPR as an expert
[2:57:17.320 --> 2:57:19.320]  but Politico came out and said it was fake the next day too
[2:57:19.320 --> 2:57:21.320]  that's one of the but I mean
[2:57:21.320 --> 2:57:23.320]  but people like Glenn Thrush
[2:57:23.320 --> 2:57:25.320]  who said in his own emails his pedestrian
[2:57:25.320 --> 2:57:27.320]  emails on the hack
[2:57:27.320 --> 2:57:29.320]  he's been promoted the New York Times
[2:57:29.320 --> 2:57:31.320]  but he's still going on NPR
[2:57:31.320 --> 2:57:33.320]  and PBS as an expert
[2:57:33.320 --> 2:57:35.320]  so I mean without admitting
[2:57:35.320 --> 2:57:37.320]  that he already admitted he was a hack and a propagandist
[2:57:37.320 --> 2:57:39.320]  so I
[2:57:39.320 --> 2:57:41.320]  I don't see many of them much house cleaning
[2:57:41.320 --> 2:57:43.320]  going on Matt stay there
[2:57:43.320 --> 2:57:45.320]  I'm going to come back go to a few calls this work segment

[2:59:47.320 --> 2:59:49.320]  if you can hear my voice
[2:59:49.320 --> 2:59:51.320]  you are the resistance
[2:59:51.320 --> 3:00:15.320]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[3:00:15.320 --> 3:00:17.320]  live from Austin Texas
[3:00:17.320 --> 3:00:21.320]  broadcasting worldwide
[3:00:21.320 --> 3:00:23.320]  it's Alex Jones
[3:00:23.320 --> 3:00:25.320]  Matt Bracken is our guest
[3:00:25.320 --> 3:00:27.320]  former Navy SEAL author, researcher
[3:00:27.320 --> 3:00:29.320]  been dead on target and we got loaded phones
[3:00:29.320 --> 3:00:31.320]  he can finish up with Daryl and Chris and Don
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:33.320]  and Harold if he needs to
[3:00:33.320 --> 3:00:35.320]  no offense if he doesn't he's got his own agenda to cover here
[3:00:35.320 --> 3:00:37.320]  but it's good to have him co-host him in the next 55 minutes
[3:00:37.320 --> 3:00:39.320]  at the end of the hour we'll play like a six minute video
[3:00:39.320 --> 3:00:41.320]  it's really hilarious and proves just how pathetic the global star
[3:00:41.320 --> 3:00:43.320]  I agree with Matt
[3:00:43.320 --> 3:00:45.320]  we're having huge victories
[3:00:45.320 --> 3:00:47.320]  I think it is a mega turn
[3:00:47.320 --> 3:00:49.320]  I mean I think it's one of the fourth turnings
[3:00:49.320 --> 3:00:51.320]  we've broken that down I think he's dead on
[3:00:51.320 --> 3:00:53.320]  but for every action there's an opposite
[3:00:53.320 --> 3:00:55.320]  and equal reaction that isn't just one way towards us
[3:00:55.320 --> 3:00:57.320]  the enemy knows this
[3:00:57.320 --> 3:00:59.320]  and is exerting every crazy power
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:01.320]  they've got to try to
[3:01:01.320 --> 3:01:03.320]  to try to derail this including I believe
[3:01:03.320 --> 3:01:05.320]  false flags with the nukes you name it
[3:01:05.320 --> 3:01:07.320]  that's why at the end of the day it's got to be
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:09.320]  people in the government at point blank
[3:01:09.320 --> 3:01:11.320]  range if they get orders
[3:01:11.320 --> 3:01:13.320]  or see autonomous stuff going out
[3:01:13.320 --> 3:01:15.320]  you're going to have to
[3:01:15.320 --> 3:01:17.320]  do whatever it takes to stop this for the good of
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:19.320]  this country and this world
[3:01:19.320 --> 3:01:21.320]  so I'm just saying the next
[3:01:21.320 --> 3:01:23.320]  not just the next 17 days I'd say the next few months
[3:01:23.320 --> 3:01:25.320]  is the most critical time
[3:01:25.320 --> 3:01:27.320]  in world history quite frankly
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:29.320]  we're living it right now Matt Bracken
[3:01:29.320 --> 3:01:31.320]  yeah and even when we're winning
[3:01:31.320 --> 3:01:33.320]  it might be the most dangerous time
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:35.320]  that's when
[3:01:35.320 --> 3:01:37.320]  somebody might pull their
[3:01:37.320 --> 3:01:39.320]  own personal doomsday device
[3:01:39.320 --> 3:01:41.320]  it might be there what the hell moment
[3:01:41.320 --> 3:01:43.320]  you know for a George Soros
[3:01:43.320 --> 3:01:45.320]  aside from
[3:01:45.320 --> 3:01:47.320]  I agree if you don't think that guy
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:49.320]  is a nerve gas I mean he's a James Bond villain
[3:01:49.320 --> 3:01:51.320]  but I don't think that he needs
[3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:53.320]  bioweapons and nerve gas
[3:01:53.320 --> 3:01:55.320]  economic yeah because
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:01:57.320]  if you crash the global economic system
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:01:59.320]  all of our major cities
[3:01:59.320 --> 3:02:01.320]  any city of more than a million people
[3:02:01.320 --> 3:02:03.320]  I mean and probably most cities over 100,000
[3:02:03.320 --> 3:02:05.320]  how dare you say someone who admits
[3:02:05.320 --> 3:02:07.320]  he loves crashing economies and starving
[3:02:07.320 --> 3:02:09.320]  people how dare you say he might do that
[3:02:09.320 --> 3:02:11.320]  well I go back to
[3:02:11.320 --> 3:02:13.320]  my you know Dr. Evil Mount Rushmore
[3:02:13.320 --> 3:02:15.320]  if you know
[3:02:15.320 --> 3:02:17.320]  you're not going to see the next presidential election
[3:02:17.320 --> 3:02:19.320]  let's say you know you've been to Switzerland
[3:02:19.320 --> 3:02:21.320]  you're getting total blood transfusions
[3:02:21.320 --> 3:02:23.320]  every week you're eating fetuses
[3:02:23.320 --> 3:02:25.320]  for breakfast you know whatever you're doing
[3:02:25.320 --> 3:02:27.320]  to extend your life and the doctors are saying
[3:02:27.320 --> 3:02:29.320]  you've got a year to go
[3:02:29.320 --> 3:02:31.320]  Mr. Soros
[3:02:31.320 --> 3:02:33.320]  then in that case he might say
[3:02:33.320 --> 3:02:35.320]  alright I'm going to crash the global
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:37.320]  economy if that happens
[3:02:37.320 --> 3:02:39.320]  because if the ATM system
[3:02:39.320 --> 3:02:41.320]  if the credit cards don't work
[3:02:41.320 --> 3:02:43.320]  if the ATMs go down
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:45.320]  if the electronic benefit transfer system crashes
[3:02:45.320 --> 3:02:47.320]  our cities will be burning inside of me
[3:02:47.320 --> 3:02:49.320]  so here's my final point
[3:02:49.320 --> 3:02:51.320]  I'm not a guy that calls for you know
[3:02:51.320 --> 3:02:53.320]  violent action but he's a clear and present danger
[3:02:53.320 --> 3:02:55.320]  he's outlived his shelf life
[3:02:55.320 --> 3:02:57.320]  what do we do then we just sit here and wait for him to do it
[3:02:57.320 --> 3:02:59.320]  probably I think he's very smart
[3:02:59.320 --> 3:03:01.320]  and I don't think he's anywhere that
[3:03:01.320 --> 3:03:03.320]  somebody can take him out
[3:03:03.320 --> 3:03:05.320]  he may in fact even have
[3:03:05.320 --> 3:03:07.320]  a dead man switch
[3:03:07.320 --> 3:03:09.320]  hooked up to the economy
[3:03:09.320 --> 3:03:11.320]  I think that's my next question
[3:03:11.320 --> 3:03:13.320]  why are they leaving him alone
[3:03:13.320 --> 3:03:15.320]  he's the number one enemy
[3:03:15.320 --> 3:03:17.320]  what has he got
[3:03:17.320 --> 3:03:19.320]  he might have a dead man switch
[3:03:19.320 --> 3:03:21.320]  like a terrorist with the
[3:03:21.320 --> 3:03:23.320]  like in speed
[3:03:23.320 --> 3:03:25.320]  you've got the dead man release button
[3:03:25.320 --> 3:03:27.320]  if anything unfortunate happens to me
[3:03:27.320 --> 3:03:29.320]  then
[3:03:29.320 --> 3:03:31.320]  the world economy crashes
[3:03:31.320 --> 3:03:33.320]  everybody sees gibberish on their computer screens
[3:03:33.320 --> 3:03:35.320]  well let me back you up on that
[3:03:35.320 --> 3:03:37.320]  globalist every time they use about to fall
[3:03:37.320 --> 3:03:39.320]  or they go do what we say or war
[3:03:39.320 --> 3:03:41.320]  people always say what do you mean
[3:03:41.320 --> 3:03:43.320]  they'll start major wars they're threatening that now
[3:03:43.320 --> 3:03:45.320]  I think the dead man switch isn't just economic man
[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:47.320]  I think it's war
[3:03:47.320 --> 3:03:49.320]  it can very well be I don't think that
[3:03:49.320 --> 3:03:51.320]  at this point any naval commander
[3:03:51.320 --> 3:03:53.320]  would obey an order
[3:03:53.320 --> 3:03:55.320]  say to launch tomahawks at Israel
[3:03:55.320 --> 3:03:57.320]  they wouldn't or Syria
[3:03:57.320 --> 3:03:59.320]  I think that there must be a lot of
[3:03:59.320 --> 3:04:01.320]  private conversations happening
[3:04:01.320 --> 3:04:03.320]  in war rooms
[3:04:03.320 --> 3:04:05.320]  in air force
[3:04:05.320 --> 3:04:07.320]  same situation
[3:04:07.320 --> 3:04:09.320]  I don't even know what they call a war room in air force
[3:04:09.320 --> 3:04:11.320]  but what would we do if we were ordered
[3:04:11.320 --> 3:04:13.320]  to do something crazy at this point
[3:04:13.320 --> 3:04:15.320]  command control centers
[3:04:15.320 --> 3:04:17.320]  sack bases
[3:04:17.320 --> 3:04:19.320]  the national command authority
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:21.320]  but the thing is
[3:04:21.320 --> 3:04:23.320]  we might never know if it was
[3:04:23.320 --> 3:04:25.320]  George Soros it could have actually just happened on its own
[3:04:25.320 --> 3:04:27.320]  you know just math alone
[3:04:27.320 --> 3:04:29.320]  just mathematics
[3:04:29.320 --> 3:04:31.320]  that we're in an unsustainable
[3:04:31.320 --> 3:04:33.320]  sure we're out of time
[3:04:33.320 --> 3:04:35.320]  I'm going to hand the baton to you
[3:04:35.320 --> 3:04:37.320]  I'm sorry to Andy Andy you say you're a writer
[3:04:37.320 --> 3:04:39.320]  I'm going to give you our email maybe write articles for us
[3:04:39.320 --> 3:04:41.320]  and I'll have you back on other callers
[3:04:41.320 --> 3:04:43.320]  sorry I didn't get you all
[3:04:43.320 --> 3:04:45.320]  Matt Brackett's taking over the rest of the show
[3:04:45.320 --> 3:04:47.320]  tonight I'm a little bit calm now from ranting
[3:04:47.320 --> 3:04:49.320]  so I'm going to put some special reports now
[3:04:49.320 --> 3:04:51.320]  I'm a little bit calmer as well as at info wars.com
[3:04:51.320 --> 3:04:53.320]  so keep track of those and get them out to everybody
[3:04:53.320 --> 3:04:55.320]  this is an info war
[3:04:55.320 --> 3:04:57.320]  we can expose these people and stop them
[3:04:57.320 --> 3:04:59.320]  and we'll see you next time
[3:05:45.320 --> 3:05:47.320]  naturally all the printed media
[3:05:47.320 --> 3:05:49.320]  had conveniently corrected his speech
[3:05:49.320 --> 3:05:51.320]  replacing Ukrainian occupation
[3:05:51.320 --> 3:05:53.320]  with Russian occupation
[3:05:53.320 --> 3:05:55.320]  but alas the speech was broadcasted live
[3:05:55.320 --> 3:05:57.320]  seen and heard by millions of people
[3:05:57.320 --> 3:05:59.320]  this has been Daria for info wars.com
[3:05:59.320 --> 3:06:01.320]  all across the western world
[3:06:01.320 --> 3:06:03.320]  MSM is attempting to
[3:06:03.320 --> 3:06:05.320]  demonize the language and words we use
[3:06:05.320 --> 3:06:07.320]  saying don't say Merry Christmas
[3:06:07.320 --> 3:06:09.320]  use holidays and now they say don't use
[3:06:09.320 --> 3:06:11.320]  holiday oh I got some news for them
[3:06:11.320 --> 3:06:13.320]  we're going to continue to use the
[3:06:13.320 --> 3:06:15.320]  speech we feel like using and we're going to
[3:06:15.320 --> 3:06:17.320]  exercise the first amendment in your
[3:06:17.320 --> 3:06:19.320]  globalist tyrannical faces

[3:06:59.320 --> 3:07:01.320]  more than 2 years ago
[3:07:01.320 --> 3:07:03.320]  info wars first told you
[3:07:03.320 --> 3:07:05.320]  about our research into what has been called
[3:07:05.320 --> 3:07:07.320]  the iodine conspiracy
[3:07:07.320 --> 3:07:09.320]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades
[3:07:09.320 --> 3:07:11.320]  that iodine deficiencies can devastate
[3:07:11.320 --> 3:07:13.320]  IQ and how the government
[3:07:13.320 --> 3:07:15.320]  knowingly started taking iodine
[3:07:15.320 --> 3:07:17.320]  out of the food and adding fluoride
[3:07:17.320 --> 3:07:19.320]  the bad member of the halogen family
[3:07:19.320 --> 3:07:21.320]  they took the good halogen
[3:07:21.320 --> 3:07:23.320]  and put the deadly halogen in
[3:07:23.320 --> 3:07:25.320]  and when the Fukushima crisis worsened
[3:07:25.320 --> 3:07:27.320]  as it still is worsening today
[3:07:27.320 --> 3:07:29.320]  I was there telling you how to prepare yourself
[3:07:29.320 --> 3:07:31.320]  and your family now in
[3:07:31.320 --> 3:07:33.320]  2016 even more information
[3:07:33.320 --> 3:07:35.320]  has been revealed concerning the connection
[3:07:35.320 --> 3:07:37.320]  between iodine and the gut
[3:07:37.320 --> 3:07:39.320]  which many experts are now saying
[3:07:39.320 --> 3:07:41.320]  could be the biggest revelation
[3:07:41.320 --> 3:07:43.320]  ever concerning iodine
[3:07:43.320 --> 3:07:45.320]  you can pull these studies up for yourself
[3:07:45.320 --> 3:07:47.320]  this is the real deal folks and the truth is
[3:07:47.320 --> 3:07:49.320]  that iodine is essential in my view
[3:07:49.320 --> 3:07:51.320]  to any optimum health regimen

[3:08:25.320 --> 3:08:27.320]  okay this is my
[3:08:27.320 --> 3:08:29.320]  first try at this so
[3:08:29.320 --> 3:08:31.320]  excuse me if I
[3:08:31.320 --> 3:08:33.320]  come across a little unpolished
[3:08:33.320 --> 3:08:35.320]  I'm
[3:08:35.320 --> 3:08:37.320]  as they say winging it
[3:08:37.320 --> 3:08:39.320]  I'd like to just talk a little bit about
[3:08:39.320 --> 3:08:41.320]  my own theory my own worst case
[3:08:41.320 --> 3:08:43.320]  sort of my nickname around this house
[3:08:43.320 --> 3:08:45.320]  is worst case scenario
[3:08:45.320 --> 3:08:47.320]  because I truly believe
[3:08:47.320 --> 3:08:49.320]  that we're in a very dangerous time
[3:08:49.320 --> 3:08:51.320]  and I'm not so concerned
[3:08:51.320 --> 3:08:53.320]  necessarily about any particular scenario
[3:08:53.320 --> 3:08:55.320]  what triggers this
[3:08:55.320 --> 3:08:57.320]  but the outcome
[3:08:57.320 --> 3:08:59.320]  any outcome
[3:08:59.320 --> 3:09:01.320]  severe enough
[3:09:01.320 --> 3:09:03.320]  that takes down our electoral grid
[3:09:03.320 --> 3:09:05.320]  could lead to an end of civilization
[3:09:05.320 --> 3:09:07.320]  and I'm not
[3:09:07.320 --> 3:09:09.320]  saying that as hyperbole
[3:09:09.320 --> 3:09:11.320]  you've seen the anger in cities like
[3:09:11.320 --> 3:09:13.320]  Baltimore and Ferguson that's when
[3:09:13.320 --> 3:09:15.320]  the electricity is actually functioning
[3:09:15.320 --> 3:09:17.320]  the water is coming out of the taps
[3:09:17.320 --> 3:09:19.320]  ATMs are spitting out dollars
[3:09:19.320 --> 3:09:21.320]  the EBT cards are working
[3:09:21.320 --> 3:09:23.320]  McDonald's is open
[3:09:23.320 --> 3:09:25.320]  if you take away all of them
[3:09:25.320 --> 3:09:27.320]  in cities of a million, 5 million, 10 million
[3:09:27.320 --> 3:09:29.320]  in America and around the world
[3:09:29.320 --> 3:09:31.320]  there will be absolute chaos
[3:09:31.320 --> 3:09:33.320]  we've built our cities into
[3:09:33.320 --> 3:09:35.320]  being the equivalent of a giant beehive
[3:09:35.320 --> 3:09:37.320]  it's all great
[3:09:37.320 --> 3:09:39.320]  while it's functioning but if somebody walks up
[3:09:39.320 --> 3:09:41.320]  and wax the beehive
[3:09:41.320 --> 3:09:43.320]  the bees come pouring out
[3:09:43.320 --> 3:09:45.320]  and there's no way to put it back together
[3:09:45.320 --> 3:09:47.320]  there's going to be a
[3:09:47.320 --> 3:09:49.320]  in that case at least for the bees
[3:09:49.320 --> 3:09:51.320]  there's going to be a massive die off
[3:09:51.320 --> 3:09:53.320]  you don't want to be near the beehive
[3:09:53.320 --> 3:09:55.320]  when that happens
[3:09:55.320 --> 3:09:57.320]  I hope it never happens, I hope we go on
[3:09:57.320 --> 3:09:59.320]  onward and upward forever
[3:09:59.320 --> 3:10:01.320]  for decades and centuries
[3:10:01.320 --> 3:10:03.320]  greater and greater technology
[3:10:03.320 --> 3:10:05.320]  inhabiting the planets
[3:10:05.320 --> 3:10:07.320]  but I have a sneaking suspicion
[3:10:07.320 --> 3:10:09.320]  that the pendulum is gone about
[3:10:09.320 --> 3:10:11.320]  as far as it's going to go
[3:10:11.320 --> 3:10:13.320]  in the direction of turning man
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:15.320]  into virtually a god
[3:10:15.320 --> 3:10:17.320]  all knowing
[3:10:17.320 --> 3:10:19.320]  with the genetic code
[3:10:19.320 --> 3:10:21.320]  determine what kind of babies
[3:10:21.320 --> 3:10:23.320]  we're going to have or not have
[3:10:23.320 --> 3:10:25.320]  I think that in the end
[3:10:25.320 --> 3:10:27.320]  the natural law or if you prefer
[3:10:27.320 --> 3:10:29.320]  god is going to have
[3:10:29.320 --> 3:10:31.320]  the last laugh
[3:10:31.320 --> 3:10:33.320]  and when the pendulum comes back
[3:10:33.320 --> 3:10:35.320]  it's going to come back very hard
[3:10:35.320 --> 3:10:37.320]  the reason for that is
[3:10:37.320 --> 3:10:39.320]  we've never in human history had a situation
[3:10:39.320 --> 3:10:41.320]  where millions of people
[3:10:41.320 --> 3:10:43.320]  have been fed from thousands
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:45.320]  of miles away
[3:10:45.320 --> 3:10:47.320]  food and the water
[3:10:47.320 --> 3:10:49.320]  everything that comes into the city
[3:10:49.320 --> 3:10:51.320]  has to be brought by a functioning
[3:10:51.320 --> 3:10:53.320]  modern infrastructure
[3:10:53.320 --> 3:10:55.320]  anything breaks the infrastructure
[3:10:55.320 --> 3:10:57.320]  and the city can't exist
[3:10:57.320 --> 3:10:59.320]  it can't survive
[3:10:59.320 --> 3:11:01.320]  where will the people go
[3:11:01.320 --> 3:11:03.320]  there's no food out in the suburbs
[3:11:03.320 --> 3:11:05.320]  a week after the cities are out of food
[3:11:05.320 --> 3:11:07.320]  so the suburbs will be out a week after that
[3:11:07.320 --> 3:11:09.320]  then what?
[3:11:09.320 --> 3:11:11.320]  our food comes from giant agribusiness farms
[3:11:11.320 --> 3:11:13.320]  that require diesel fuel
[3:11:13.320 --> 3:11:15.320]  and fertilizer and chemicals
[3:11:15.320 --> 3:11:17.320]  to get that food to the trains
[3:11:17.320 --> 3:11:19.320]  and the trucks to the production centers
[3:11:19.320 --> 3:11:21.320]  and to our supermarkets
[3:11:21.320 --> 3:11:23.320]  any of that fails
[3:11:23.320 --> 3:11:25.320]  and we're going to be in a hunger situation
[3:11:25.320 --> 3:11:27.320]  very fast
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:29.320]  sometimes I think about Jamestown
[3:11:29.320 --> 3:11:31.320]  one of their first winters
[3:11:31.320 --> 3:11:33.320]  they had a starvation winter
[3:11:33.320 --> 3:11:35.320]  these were very tough people
[3:11:35.320 --> 3:11:37.320]  they were a lot heartier than we ever would be
[3:11:37.320 --> 3:11:39.320]  these were pilgrims
[3:11:39.320 --> 3:11:41.320]  these were people that knew how to
[3:11:41.320 --> 3:11:43.320]  skin animals
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:45.320]  and grow their own food
[3:11:45.320 --> 3:11:47.320]  half of them starved in one bad winter
[3:11:47.320 --> 3:11:49.320]  imagine a city today
[3:11:49.320 --> 3:11:51.320]  how many of the people living in that city
[3:11:51.320 --> 3:11:53.320]  could survive for two months
[3:11:53.320 --> 3:11:55.320]  if the supermarkets were looted
[3:11:55.320 --> 3:11:57.320]  and burned
[3:11:57.320 --> 3:11:59.320]  not very many
[3:11:59.320 --> 3:12:01.320]  so I always come back first
[3:12:01.320 --> 3:12:03.320]  to what can you do to
[3:12:03.320 --> 3:12:05.320]  prevent that
[3:12:05.320 --> 3:12:07.320]  naturally I would suggest
[3:12:07.320 --> 3:12:09.320]  buying if you're going to buy
[3:12:09.320 --> 3:12:11.320]  whatever supplies do it right here on InfoWars
[3:12:11.320 --> 3:12:13.320]  because
[3:12:13.320 --> 3:12:15.320]  it's a great way to not only help yourself
[3:12:15.320 --> 3:12:17.320]  but help the cause so to speak
[3:12:17.320 --> 3:12:19.320]  but I also always come back to water
[3:12:19.320 --> 3:12:21.320]  do you know where the water
[3:12:21.320 --> 3:12:23.320]  that's coming out of your tap
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:25.320]  and out of your shower, do you know where it comes from
[3:12:25.320 --> 3:12:27.320]  how long would it last
[3:12:27.320 --> 3:12:29.320]  if the grid went down
[3:12:29.320 --> 3:12:31.320]  there are backup generators that can run for a few days
[3:12:31.320 --> 3:12:33.320]  most of our backup system
[3:12:33.320 --> 3:12:35.320]  is only meant to function
[3:12:35.320 --> 3:12:37.320]  say during an ice storm
[3:12:37.320 --> 3:12:39.320]  in a hurricane
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:41.320]  for a few days or a week
[3:12:41.320 --> 3:12:43.320]  then here comes FEMA
[3:12:43.320 --> 3:12:45.320]  if a big part of the country
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:47.320]  or the entire country had a grid collapse
[3:12:47.320 --> 3:12:49.320]  then what
[3:12:49.320 --> 3:12:51.320]  who's going to come to save you, nobody
[3:12:51.320 --> 3:12:53.320]  the only people that are going to be coming
[3:12:53.320 --> 3:12:55.320]  are going to be people that are even hungrier
[3:12:55.320 --> 3:12:57.320]  and more desperate than you are
[3:12:57.320 --> 3:12:59.320]  and they're going to be looking for your food
[3:12:59.320 --> 3:13:01.320]  so the first thing I like to ask people
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:03.320]  is do you know where your water comes from
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:05.320]  and how long would it last
[3:13:05.320 --> 3:13:07.320]  until a well
[3:13:07.320 --> 3:13:09.320]  that doesn't require a grid electricity
[3:13:09.320 --> 3:13:11.320]  to pull the water up
[3:13:11.320 --> 3:13:13.320]  and I'm afraid that most people
[3:13:13.320 --> 3:13:15.320]  probably 80 or 90%
[3:13:15.320 --> 3:13:17.320]  would have to answer
[3:13:17.320 --> 3:13:19.320]  if the city water goes down
[3:13:19.320 --> 3:13:21.320]  my tap goes dry
[3:13:21.320 --> 3:13:23.320]  there's nothing I can do about it
[3:13:23.320 --> 3:13:25.320]  and we've seen this over and over again
[3:13:25.320 --> 3:13:27.320]  in history where
[3:13:27.320 --> 3:13:29.320]  due to a prolonged drought
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:31.320]  at the end of a civilization's
[3:13:31.320 --> 3:13:33.320]  building cycle
[3:13:33.320 --> 3:13:35.320]  the
[3:13:35.320 --> 3:13:37.320]  Pueblo dwelling Indians
[3:13:37.320 --> 3:13:39.320]  the Southwest they built big cities
[3:13:39.320 --> 3:13:41.320]  chopped down all the trees then you get a big drought
[3:13:41.320 --> 3:13:43.320]  the city dies
[3:13:43.320 --> 3:13:45.320]  you come back a few centuries later nobody's there
[3:13:45.320 --> 3:13:47.320]  you could speed that up
[3:13:47.320 --> 3:13:49.320]  by orders of magnitude
[3:13:49.320 --> 3:13:51.320]  for a modern city
[3:13:51.320 --> 3:13:53.320]  because of the social cohesion
[3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:55.320]  that would absolutely
[3:13:55.320 --> 3:13:57.320]  break down
[3:13:57.320 --> 3:13:59.320]  you'd have anarchy, looting, rioting
[3:13:59.320 --> 3:14:01.320]  murder and probably within a few weeks
[3:14:01.320 --> 3:14:03.320]  cannibalism
[3:14:03.320 --> 3:14:05.320]  and it's a real cheerful way to begin the new year
[3:14:05.320 --> 3:14:07.320]  but
[3:14:07.320 --> 3:14:09.320]  I believe in not sugarcoating it
[3:14:09.320 --> 3:14:11.320]  I don't think that
[3:14:11.320 --> 3:14:13.320]  there's ever been a time in history when we've been more vulnerable
[3:14:13.320 --> 3:14:15.320]  and the only answer
[3:14:15.320 --> 3:14:17.320]  to what I'm saying is but Matt
[3:14:17.320 --> 3:14:19.320]  the grid could never collapse
[3:14:19.320 --> 3:14:21.320]  the economic system could never collapse
[3:14:21.320 --> 3:14:23.320]  really smart people are working on it
[3:14:23.320 --> 3:14:25.320]  really the best minds
[3:14:25.320 --> 3:14:27.320]  are on top of this
[3:14:27.320 --> 3:14:29.320]  I don't believe that they are
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:31.320]  on a rickety bridge
[3:14:31.320 --> 3:14:33.320]  with the supports breaking underneath
[3:14:33.320 --> 3:14:35.320]  I hope I'm wrong
[3:14:35.320 --> 3:14:37.320]  I would like nothing better than
[3:14:37.320 --> 3:14:39.320]  in ten years everybody laughs at me
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:41.320]  and holds my books up and mocks me
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:43.320]  because
[3:14:43.320 --> 3:14:45.320]  I'd be a happy guy, I'd be out on a sailboat
[3:14:45.320 --> 3:14:47.320]  or you know
[3:14:47.320 --> 3:14:49.320]  with grandchildren by then maybe
[3:14:49.320 --> 3:14:51.320]  living in a great country and I'll take all the laughter
[3:14:51.320 --> 3:14:53.320]  and all the ribbing
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:55.320]  in good humor
[3:14:55.320 --> 3:14:57.320]  I want to be wrong about this is what I'm saying
[3:14:57.320 --> 3:14:59.320]  I don't want to be right
[3:14:59.320 --> 3:15:01.320]  but these next few weeks
[3:15:01.320 --> 3:15:03.320]  before the inauguration
[3:15:03.320 --> 3:15:05.320]  we might finally put to the test
[3:15:05.320 --> 3:15:07.320]  you know will George Soros
[3:15:07.320 --> 3:15:09.320]  and Obama go off into the sunset
[3:15:09.320 --> 3:15:11.320]  or will they
[3:15:11.320 --> 3:15:13.320]  pull their doomsday switch
[3:15:13.320 --> 3:15:15.320]  that if I can't run the world
[3:15:15.320 --> 3:15:17.320]  nobody can
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:19.320]  these are people that are that
[3:15:19.320 --> 3:15:21.320]  evil that they would actually do it
[3:15:21.320 --> 3:15:23.320]  now they might think that they can calibrate
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:25.320]  the punishment
[3:15:25.320 --> 3:15:27.320]  punish America with a certain degree
[3:15:27.320 --> 3:15:29.320]  my fear is that
[3:15:29.320 --> 3:15:31.320]  any kind of a
[3:15:31.320 --> 3:15:33.320]  attack against the financial system
[3:15:33.320 --> 3:15:35.320]  will spill over
[3:15:35.320 --> 3:15:37.320]  to the electrical grid
[3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:39.320]  and to the internet
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:41.320]  almost like three different
[3:15:41.320 --> 3:15:43.320]  body systems like say the nervous system
[3:15:43.320 --> 3:15:45.320]  the blood circulation system
[3:15:45.320 --> 3:15:47.320]  the skeletal muscular system
[3:15:47.320 --> 3:15:49.320]  you can't live just with one of them
[3:15:49.320 --> 3:15:51.320]  removed
[3:15:51.320 --> 3:15:53.320]  the others go down if any of them go down
[3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:55.320]  if the financial system goes down
[3:15:55.320 --> 3:15:57.320]  people aren't being paid
[3:15:57.320 --> 3:15:59.320]  they won't go to work
[3:15:59.320 --> 3:16:01.320]  the power plant shuts down
[3:16:01.320 --> 3:16:03.320]  the internet goes down
[3:16:03.320 --> 3:16:05.320]  the infrastructure is probably
[3:16:05.320 --> 3:16:07.320]  going to go down too very soon
[3:16:07.320 --> 3:16:09.320]  after that so
[3:16:09.320 --> 3:16:11.320]  I'm just saying
[3:16:11.320 --> 3:16:13.320]  the people that might
[3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:15.320]  have an interest in seeing the house
[3:16:15.320 --> 3:16:17.320]  burn down before Trump is inaugurated
[3:16:17.320 --> 3:16:19.320]  or even during his term
[3:16:19.320 --> 3:16:21.320]  even if they think they would just be giving us
[3:16:21.320 --> 3:16:23.320]  a mild beating
[3:16:23.320 --> 3:16:25.320]  it still might cascade into an unstoppable
[3:16:25.320 --> 3:16:27.320]  crisis
[3:16:27.320 --> 3:16:29.320]  and I just like to tell everybody
[3:16:29.320 --> 3:16:31.320]  if you can, instead of buying another
[3:16:31.320 --> 3:16:33.320]  AR-15
[3:16:33.320 --> 3:16:35.320]  buy another couple months worth of food
[3:16:35.320 --> 3:16:37.320]  and if you can
[3:16:37.320 --> 3:16:39.320]  get enough water to last for a long time
[3:16:39.320 --> 3:16:41.320]  because
[3:16:41.320 --> 3:16:43.320]  in some scenarios
[3:16:43.320 --> 3:16:45.320]  three months of food wouldn't even be enough
[3:16:45.320 --> 3:16:47.320]  but it's like surviving on a life raft
[3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:49.320]  maybe three months of food
[3:16:49.320 --> 3:16:51.320]  is enough
[3:16:51.320 --> 3:16:53.320]  if you reach an island in two months
[3:16:53.320 --> 3:16:55.320]  so you never can say
[3:16:55.320 --> 3:16:57.320]  I can't have enough food to last forever
[3:16:57.320 --> 3:16:59.320]  so I might as well have no survival food
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:01.320]  a couple of months might mean
[3:17:01.320 --> 3:17:03.320]  that by the time you need
[3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:05.320]  to go out foraging for food
[3:17:05.320 --> 3:17:07.320]  most of the idiots have already been killed off
[3:17:07.320 --> 3:17:09.320]  most of the dangerous criminals
[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:11.320]  have already been shot down
[3:17:11.320 --> 3:17:13.320]  so you don't have to engage in those
[3:17:13.320 --> 3:17:15.320]  running street battles
[3:17:15.320 --> 3:17:17.320]  but in the meantime
[3:17:17.320 --> 3:17:19.320]  I would suggest strongly
[3:17:19.320 --> 3:17:21.320]  survival food, survival purification systems
[3:17:21.320 --> 3:17:23.320]  and survival water
[3:17:23.320 --> 3:17:25.320]  because you don't know when it's going to happen
[3:17:25.320 --> 3:17:27.320]  and when it happens it's going to be too late
[3:17:27.320 --> 3:17:29.320]  to go out and buy it then
[3:17:29.320 --> 3:17:31.320]  I'm
[3:17:31.320 --> 3:17:33.320]  not really aware of what the clock is doing
[3:17:33.320 --> 3:17:35.320]  in terms of my going right over here
[3:17:35.320 --> 3:17:37.320]  you're going to break here in about two minutes Matt
[3:17:37.320 --> 3:17:39.320]  okay
[3:17:39.320 --> 3:17:41.320]  well I've got a
[3:17:41.320 --> 3:17:43.320]  I've got an ad to read
[3:17:43.320 --> 3:17:45.320]  if you don't mind
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:47.320]  I'm enjoying hearing you talk
[3:17:47.320 --> 3:17:49.320]  I'm sitting here eating my lunch
[3:17:49.320 --> 3:17:51.320]  and I got all these piles of work to do watching you
[3:17:51.320 --> 3:17:53.320]  so it's good to hear you want to break about three minutes
[3:17:53.320 --> 3:17:55.320]  then come back with a six minute segment
[3:17:55.320 --> 3:17:57.320]  and an 18 minute segment
[3:17:57.320 --> 3:17:59.320]  again we'll email you all that I thought we had done that
[3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:01.320]  but just you don't have to worry about plugging stuff
[3:18:01.320 --> 3:18:03.320]  sure we got free shipping for a couple more days
[3:18:03.320 --> 3:18:05.320]  and that helps finance things
[3:18:05.320 --> 3:18:07.320]  and we've got a lot of great vitamins
[3:18:07.320 --> 3:18:09.320]  and stuff people need and good swirable foods
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:11.320]  but it's all I gotta tell you this Matt
[3:18:11.320 --> 3:18:13.320]  I've personally
[3:18:13.320 --> 3:18:15.320]  because I really know that's where this is going
[3:18:15.320 --> 3:18:17.320]  I'd give it about a
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:19.320]  50% chance we'll be in depression
[3:18:19.320 --> 3:18:21.320]  maybe Americanism versus globalism
[3:18:21.320 --> 3:18:23.320]  can restart the global economy but I don't know
[3:18:23.320 --> 3:18:25.320]  the globalists were planning
[3:18:25.320 --> 3:18:27.320]  the stake down
[3:18:27.320 --> 3:18:29.320]  and they had admitted that now because
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:31.320]  of prosperity coming back maybe it won't happen
[3:18:31.320 --> 3:18:33.320]  but we know this
[3:18:33.320 --> 3:18:35.320]  there's a very good chance that we're going into a
[3:18:35.320 --> 3:18:37.320]  depressionary spiral
[3:18:37.320 --> 3:18:39.320]  and some of the
[3:18:39.320 --> 3:18:41.320]  best people to know
[3:18:41.320 --> 3:18:43.320]  if you have some friends in your social circle
[3:18:43.320 --> 3:18:45.320]  ham radio operators
[3:18:45.320 --> 3:18:47.320]  people that know how to
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:49.320]  communicate further than VHF
[3:18:49.320 --> 3:18:51.320]  anybody and I don't care if he's a
[3:18:51.320 --> 3:18:53.320]  90 year old anybody that can
[3:18:53.320 --> 3:18:55.320]  communicate
[3:18:55.320 --> 3:18:57.320]  beyond line of sight beyond VHF
[3:18:57.320 --> 3:18:59.320]  he's going to be a most valuable player
[3:18:59.320 --> 3:19:01.320]  and so is the guy with a light plane
[3:19:01.320 --> 3:19:03.320]  anybody with a
[3:19:03.320 --> 3:19:05.320]  single or a light twin that can land on a road
[3:19:05.320 --> 3:19:07.320]  might be the guy that gets
[3:19:07.320 --> 3:19:09.320]  your family out of a bad place because
[3:19:09.320 --> 3:19:11.320]  forget about the Winnebago getting across the bridge
[3:19:11.320 --> 3:19:13.320]  it's just not going to happen
[3:19:13.320 --> 3:19:15.320]  if your doomsday escape device
[3:19:15.320 --> 3:19:17.320]  is a Winnebago
[3:19:17.320 --> 3:19:19.320]  hauling a trailer loaded with MREs
[3:19:19.320 --> 3:19:21.320]  just stay at home and eat them there
[3:19:21.320 --> 3:19:23.320]  because you're just going to wind up on the
[3:19:23.320 --> 3:19:25.320]  Beltway stuck in
[3:19:25.320 --> 3:19:27.320]  gridlock
[3:19:27.320 --> 3:19:29.320]  but on the other hand if you have a friend
[3:19:29.320 --> 3:19:31.320]  with a Cessna
[3:19:31.320 --> 3:19:33.320]  that's the guy that's going to be a real hero
[3:19:33.320 --> 3:19:35.320]  as long as you can fuel up that airplane
[3:19:35.320 --> 3:19:37.320]  it's going to be able to take you anywhere
[3:19:37.320 --> 3:19:39.320]  you need to go
[3:19:39.320 --> 3:19:41.320]  and there's nobody that can stop it nobody
[3:19:41.320 --> 3:19:43.320]  all right Matt we're going to break back in four minutes
[3:19:43.320 --> 3:19:45.320]  in a short segment of a long segment
[3:19:45.320 --> 3:19:47.320]  I'm on Jones hate interrupting when I'm
[3:19:47.320 --> 3:19:49.320]  needed

[3:21:23.320 --> 3:21:25.320]  spokesman for the company natural disasters
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:27.320]  terrorist attacks and other threats

There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives and you could be one of them. It's called heart and body extract. Sharon Harris co-creator of heart and body extract talks about the positive effects of heart and body extract.
[3:22:23.320 --> 3:22:31.320]  What happens with the formula heart and body extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients
[3:22:31.320 --> 3:22:33.320]  so the body will heal itself and yes
[3:22:33.320 --> 3:22:39.320]  the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries
[3:22:39.320 --> 3:22:43.320]  it can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics
[3:22:43.320 --> 3:22:45.320]  so the body is an amazing thing
[3:22:45.320 --> 3:22:47.320]  it simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.

[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:17.320]  Something shocking just happened in a Coast Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying the young bucks and head to head fitness tests. How is this even possible?
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:25.320]  Turns out the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor formulated fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens.
[3:23:25.320 --> 3:23:32.320]  Patriot Power Greens has been so effective for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles and lack of energy a thing of the past.
[3:23:32.320 --> 3:23:43.320]  Previously this drink was only available to elite military units, but for a limited time the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends.
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:55.320]  All they ask is that you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping. To claim your free samples of Patriot Power Greens go to green75.com. That's green75.com.

[3:24:05.320 --> 3:24:21.320]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[3:24:21.320 --> 3:24:31.320]  Well, we're back. If you're still with me, pretty raw here. I'm really a writer, so doing this live is something new for me.
[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:41.320]  Now, being that I'm a writer, I'd like to advise people that think Matt Bracken, he seems pretty interesting even if he's pretty far out there.
[3:24:41.320 --> 3:24:51.320]  Has he ever written about this? Well, that's what I do for a living. And some of my stuff that I've written in the last few years, if you want to really know what I'm thinking is going on.
[3:24:51.320 --> 3:24:58.320]  You can find it on my website, enemiesfarnanddomestic, I have a page full of links to my short stories.
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:07.320]  And probably the one that I would recommend, if anybody reads anything of mine, is a short story called A Last Brave New Babylon.
[3:25:07.320 --> 3:25:22.320]  And this is what I would consider a worst case scenario with the grid going down, people don't even know why, and there are very few survivors.
[3:25:22.320 --> 3:25:39.320]  If this really is a grand supercycle event, we're talking a thousand year cycle, wheels then wheels, all coming at the same time together, we're going to see something possibly a lot worse than the 30 years were in Europe or possibly even the World Wars,
[3:25:39.320 --> 3:25:49.320]  because it's possible that there will be very few people that are unscathed. I don't see how the contagion could be stopped from going around the world if the grid goes down.
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:58.320]  Trade will stop, water will stop flowing, electricity will stop flowing, and it's going to be really a brave new world.
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:08.320]  And anyway, on that same page, I've got short stories and essays linked that I've been writing for the last couple of years.
[3:26:08.320 --> 3:26:23.320]  I've almost got another novel ready to go, but yeah, I've almost got another novel. I don't have any of these controls here, so I'm just doing it with the Austin studio helping me out here.
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:31.320]  But all of my most current thinking is pretty much on them, and of course on my novels, in my novels.
[3:26:31.320 --> 3:26:41.320]  Amy's Farm and Domestic, The Trilogy, and Other Stand alone works. But yeah, I think that this is a very dangerous time for our country,
[3:26:41.320 --> 3:26:54.320]  because the people that have dedicated their entire lives, multi-generations of lives, you think about Obama being the offspring of Frank Marshall Davis, people like that.
[3:26:54.320 --> 3:27:03.320]  We're talking, you know, sometimes three and four generations of communists, now they call themselves progressives, which is just rebranding of the exact same thing.
[3:27:03.320 --> 3:27:10.320]  They're not going to see their waterloo and just walk away. They're not just going to pick up their marbles and go home.
[3:27:10.320 --> 3:27:16.320]  I believe that they think that if they can't rule, then they're going to just will inherit ruins.
[3:27:16.320 --> 3:27:28.320]  And my fear is that we won't be able to stop a cascade from happening. And no matter if it's Trump as president or Hillary, frankly,
[3:27:28.320 --> 3:27:41.320]  the worst effects will be not stoppable by any human, just as, you know, you can't, you know, King Canute can't just hold back the tide just because he wills it and he wishes and demands it.
[3:27:41.320 --> 3:27:47.320]  The levers of power just won't exist. If the grid collapses, basically we're screwed.
[3:27:47.320 --> 3:28:02.320]  Anyway, I usually like to talk to Alex about this because we go back and forth. Now I've got my chance to talk and I'm floundering around here.
[3:28:02.320 --> 3:28:08.320]  I'm so sorry. They told me that they cleared the boards of phone calls. That was going to be my next go-to.
[3:28:08.320 --> 3:28:13.320]  But yeah, I've written some stuff that's pretty provocative.
[3:28:13.320 --> 3:28:20.320]  Another place that I write for pretty frequently is called Gates of Vienna, which is a counter Jihad website.
[3:28:20.320 --> 3:28:37.320]  The most recent thing that I wrote for them is called Piss Karan, which is a short story about basically an old construction worker going up on a crane in New York with a karan and a bucket.
[3:28:37.320 --> 3:28:45.320]  And if the Serrano exhibit at the museum across the street is going to open, then he's going to make his own art called the Piss Karan.
[3:28:45.320 --> 3:28:54.320]  And it's basically an allegory for exploring the massive hypocrisy and double standard where we're just supposed to take anything that's coming out of Islam.
[3:28:54.320 --> 3:29:02.320]  It's their way. Just accept it. Women are beaten who cares. Women are forced to cover up. Doesn't matter. That's their culture.
[3:29:02.320 --> 3:29:11.320]  But God forbid you should say one thing about a crucifix being dunked in urine. Then you're a bigot. You don't appreciate good art.
[3:29:11.320 --> 3:29:15.320]  So that's one of the last major short stories that I wrote.
[3:29:15.320 --> 3:29:23.320]  These things are all free to read on Gates of Vienna, Western Rifle Shooters, other places.
[3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:29.320]  The links are all on my links page on my website, as well as my books, of course.
[3:29:29.320 --> 3:29:37.320]  But yeah, Tet Take Two, that's probably, that's had a lot of reads.
[3:29:37.320 --> 3:29:42.320]  Another one that's not on Gates of Vienna is called When the Music Stops.
[3:29:42.320 --> 3:29:48.320]  How America's Cities May Explode in Violence. That's also been read tens of thousands of times.
[3:29:48.320 --> 3:29:50.320]  And I recommend everybody go and find them.
[3:29:50.320 --> 3:30:00.320]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:30:23.320 --> 3:30:27.320]  Hence their love for torchlight processions, which were especially popular in Hitler's Germany.
[3:30:27.320 --> 3:30:30.320]  The present-day admirers of Bandera are deeply misled.
[3:30:30.320 --> 3:30:35.320]  They glorify the myths given to them, conveniently ignoring the facts of history, repeated in present-day Ukraine.
[3:30:35.320 --> 3:30:39.320]  They murder their own countrymen under the guise of liberation of the people.
[3:30:39.320 --> 3:30:43.320]  They murder their own ideological supporters who happen to choose a different leader.
[3:30:43.320 --> 3:30:45.320]  And they call it fighting for their country's independence.
[3:30:45.320 --> 3:30:50.320]  They murder and betray each other under the guise of unity and brotherhood, but let's call it for what it is.
[3:30:50.320 --> 3:30:53.320]  Betrayal. Betrayal of your people and your country.
[3:30:53.320 --> 3:30:57.320]  And the enemy within is more dangerous than any outside threat.
[3:30:57.320 --> 3:31:22.320]  This has been Daria for Infowars.com.
[3:31:27.320 --> 3:31:37.320]  Another win-win.
[3:32:00.320 --> 3:32:05.320]  As we get ready to kick off 2017, it's more important than ever to realize.
[3:32:05.320 --> 3:32:09.320]  It's the first amendment that allowed us to defeat the globalist witch, Hillary Clinton.
[3:32:09.320 --> 3:32:13.320]  And these enemies of free speech are out there telling us, don't say Merry Christmas.
[3:32:13.320 --> 3:32:14.320]  In fact, don't even say holidays.
[3:32:14.320 --> 3:32:15.320]  Well, I got news for them.
[3:32:15.320 --> 3:32:23.320]  Just because of them doing that, I'm going to extend our Christmas sales right through into 2017.
[3:32:23.320 --> 3:32:30.320]  We're talking store-wide free shipping and 50 to 25% off on the nutraceuticals and so much more.
[3:32:30.320 --> 3:32:36.320]  So whether it's a Hillary for President 2017 shirt, or whether it's Survival Shield X2, our super male vitality,
[3:32:36.320 --> 3:32:42.320]  we've got the biggest sales of 2016 right into 2017, while supplies last.
[3:32:42.320 --> 3:32:46.320]  We are selling out of many of these items because this sale is so big and we've extended it,
[3:32:46.320 --> 3:32:50.320]  so please take advantage of this and again thank you for fighting for the Infowar
[3:32:50.320 --> 3:32:55.320]  and supporting our operation and supporting not just the First Amendment, but free speech worldwide.
[3:32:55.320 --> 3:33:21.320]  That's infowarsstore.com, or go right to the supplements at infowarslive.com.
[3:33:21.320 --> 3:33:38.320]  We're watching the news in the last week, especially the new UN resolution orchestrated by Obama.
[3:33:38.320 --> 3:33:44.320]  It's really hard not to start wondering about end times.
[3:33:44.320 --> 3:33:51.320]  When you consider the location of Israel, the history of the Jews returning to their ancestral homelands,
[3:33:51.320 --> 3:33:56.320]  making a nation state, and now the entire world basically ganging up against them
[3:33:56.320 --> 3:34:00.320]  as if they're the malignant cancer on the entire world.
[3:34:00.320 --> 3:34:06.320]  I think I saw where in the last year there have been 20 UN resolutions against Israel,
[3:34:06.320 --> 3:34:10.320]  one against North Korea, one against Syria, one against Iran.
[3:34:10.320 --> 3:34:19.320]  It's pretty apparent that we've gone through the looking glass and the UN is now basically team evil.
[3:34:19.320 --> 3:34:26.320]  On the UN Human Rights Commission are all of the worst countries in the world, Saudi Arabia, terror states.
[3:34:26.320 --> 3:34:30.320]  They absolutely have no interest in what we consider human rights.
[3:34:30.320 --> 3:34:40.320]  When you think about the confluence of events with the inauguration coming up, Netanyahu's house being raided, this UN resolution,
[3:34:40.320 --> 3:34:43.320]  you have to wonder if somebody is going to go rogue.
[3:34:43.320 --> 3:34:52.320]  Some F-16 pilot is going to plant an iron bomb or maybe a guided bomb right in the middle of the Dome of the Rock.
[3:34:52.320 --> 3:34:59.320]  It's the kind of days where you just wonder what would be too outrageous, almost nothing at this point.
[3:34:59.320 --> 3:35:06.320]  Every morning when I wake up, I turn on the first, I see the clock is still working, so I've still got the grid.
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:13.320]  I turn on the TV and if they're still talking about what they were talking about yesterday, I say, great, we made it through another night.
[3:35:13.320 --> 3:35:22.320]  Because morning by morning, I won't be surprised to turn on the TV just like we did in 2001 with 9-11.
[3:35:22.320 --> 3:35:35.320]  I won't be surprised if we turn on the TV and we see an aircraft carrier on fire in the Straits of Hormuz or some other military calamity on that level.
[3:35:35.320 --> 3:35:40.320]  We have been walking right up to the line, tiptoeing up to the line.
[3:35:40.320 --> 3:35:48.320]  A month ago, an American ship, sheep dipped I think for the Yemeni forces, whatever they are.
[3:35:48.320 --> 3:35:57.320]  One of those aluminum catamarans was hit from a land-based missile, didn't quite sink it, but virtually destroyed it.
[3:35:57.320 --> 3:36:03.320]  We're walking very close to where they're going to hit ships and our ships are going to hit back.
[3:36:03.320 --> 3:36:08.320]  From there, it would be a very easy walk to World War III.
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:16.320]  With Obama doing this backstab on Israel last week, at this point I wonder what other tricks does he have up his sleeve?
[3:36:16.320 --> 3:36:21.320]  Is he going to do something to literally set the house on fire before he leaves?
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:31.320]  Or does he just want to leave Trump in a checkmate situation in the corner where he can hardly move without creating a greater disaster?
[3:36:31.320 --> 3:36:35.320]  That's what happens when you elect a traitor mole as your president.
[3:36:35.320 --> 3:36:47.320]  A slick con man who's been having the doors open in front of him from the time that he was an adolescent with some kind of what I would consider a red net.
[3:36:47.320 --> 3:36:55.320]  Sort of the old boy's network of lefty progressive communists have been greasing the skids for Obama since he was a child.
[3:36:55.320 --> 3:36:59.320]  Here he is. It's his swan song three weeks to go.
[3:36:59.320 --> 3:37:04.320]  All of his legacy, his executive orders, they're going to be swept away.
[3:37:04.320 --> 3:37:08.320]  Is he going to just go away like that, set up another action committee?
[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:13.320]  Or is he going to do something to really set the thing on fire before he goes?
[3:37:13.320 --> 3:37:21.320]  I have to wonder, and with the events in Israel, it almost feels like there's a bullseye being painted somewhere on Jerusalem.
[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:27.320]  I wouldn't be surprised if the next big explosion or terror events in Jerusalem.
[3:37:27.320 --> 3:37:39.320]  And I wouldn't be surprised if something really paradigm changing like on the level of somebody blowing up the dome of the rock to just kick this thing right into high gear.
[3:37:39.320 --> 3:37:45.320]  I don't know about you, but I'm glad I have a well in the backyard that has a hand pump on it.
[3:37:45.320 --> 3:37:47.320]  It doesn't require electricity.
[3:37:47.320 --> 3:37:51.320]  At least I know I'm going to be drinking water no matter what.
[3:37:51.320 --> 3:37:57.320]  That's something I would strongly consider if it's in your capability to do so.
[3:37:57.320 --> 3:38:02.320]  Have a lot of water on hand. These aren't normal times.
[3:38:02.320 --> 3:38:12.320]  They say that the Jews in Germany, right through the 20s and 30s, they were like the frogs in the pot being boiled.
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:20.320]  They thought at every step there would be some outside force would stop the madness and save them.
[3:38:20.320 --> 3:38:24.320]  It would be Bismarck would get rid of this Hitler. Bismarck would stop him.
[3:38:24.320 --> 3:38:29.320]  Or the honorable generals of the Wehrmacht, they would step in and stop him.
[3:38:29.320 --> 3:38:38.320]  But it was just a slide where at each turn the water got hotter and the exit doors got nailed shut one at a time.
[3:38:38.320 --> 3:38:54.320]  And I feel like we're almost in a situation similar to that where events, instead of a Hitler per se, but just world events just seem to be tumbling like dice that won't stop just turning and turning and turning.
[3:38:54.320 --> 3:38:58.320]  And I just have the feeling that it's going to end on a real bad number.
[3:38:58.320 --> 3:39:14.320]  And I hope I'm wrong. I mean, I say all the time, I hope I'm just a guy who's got some too far out theories and doesn't understand how inherently stable the world situation really is.
[3:39:14.320 --> 3:39:20.320]  And there are very smart people out there that are way ahead of any trouble.
[3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:23.320]  But in my gut, I don't feel like that's true.
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:32.320]  And over and over again in history, the normalcy bias has done people in. They thought things are great.
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:42.320]  Things could never change from here, but the world is full of abandoned cities that were once flourishing and something changed and the cities collapsed.
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:45.320]  It's not usually a slow event when a city collapses.
[3:39:45.320 --> 3:39:53.320]  It's like the fall of Phnom Penh when the Khmer Rouge came in, they're emptied out. They just become a ghost town very quickly.
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:40:01.320]  You take the water and the electronic infrastructure out of a modern city, it can't exist. Where will those people go?
[3:40:01.320 --> 3:40:13.320]  So I encourage people to read my short stuff, my novels of course, but my short stuff like Alas, Brave New Babylon, if you want to get an idea of what goes on between my ears,
[3:40:13.320 --> 3:40:17.320]  maybe you don't want to, it might be a pretty scary place.
[3:40:17.320 --> 3:40:32.320]  But a lot of people have read these things. I should be on my sixth or seventh novel by now, but the last few years under Obama, I felt like it was more important to put out free short work than to focus on my next novel.
[3:40:32.320 --> 3:40:40.320]  I do have another novel that's almost finished. It's about 90% finished. It should be done in a month or so.
[3:40:40.320 --> 3:40:44.320]  That's for another show, we'll talk about that.
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:50.320]  These are definitely interesting times. I feel like we're living in history.
[3:40:50.320 --> 3:41:02.320]  We're sitting in the front row of the theater and we're about to watch Abe get shot up there and here comes somebody swinging down under the stage.
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:13.320]  We have front row seats. As long as the electricity holds out, we'll at least see. It might be fake news. It might be doctored somewhat, but we're going to know when it's really happening.
[3:41:13.320 --> 3:41:28.320]  I think it's going to be something that's never been seen before in history because all of the other societal and civilizational collapses that happened, they didn't happen in societies that were dependent on electricity to keep the food fresh.
[3:41:28.320 --> 3:41:36.320]  These were all societies where food was lardered and stored in cisterns and grain warehouses.
[3:41:36.320 --> 3:41:46.320]  So when war swept through, that just meant you lost a planning cycle, the food was grown in the next county over maybe two counties away.
[3:41:46.320 --> 3:41:50.320]  But in our case, the food is now grown a thousand miles away.
[3:41:50.320 --> 3:41:59.320]  I often ask the rhetorical question, how much food do they grow in your zip code? Honestly, how much food do they grow in your telephone area code?
[3:41:59.320 --> 3:42:12.320]  Because if the infrastructure, if the grid collapses, the only food you're going to get, maybe for years, is food that is grown within a horse's ability to carry a wagon.
[3:42:12.320 --> 3:42:22.320]  I'm serious. All of our magic tricks, all of our technological magic tricks, they require all of the other tricks to be working in perfect synchronization.
[3:42:22.320 --> 3:42:39.320]  It's like a Swiss watch. If you take the most expensive $6,000 self-winding, Rolex, Oyster Submariner Pro, and you stab a ice pick right through it, you've only damaged a few pieces.
[3:42:39.320 --> 3:42:48.320]  But the whole watch comes completely to a stop. And that's sort of an analogy for our modern civilizational infrastructure.
[3:42:48.320 --> 3:43:05.320]  If the banking system fails, if the EBT system is hacked, if our electoral grid is hacked or corrupted, it's going to be very hard to self-repair before our cities just explode, burn, and self-emily.
[3:43:05.320 --> 3:43:24.320]  I mean, we've already seen the lack of social cohesion in good times. What will happen when I see these people rioting over TV's on Christmas Eve, fighting each other, going to fights, looking forward to going to fights, using social media to get to fights?
[3:43:24.320 --> 3:43:32.320]  I think how will these people act when they're in the dark, hungry, and nothing is coming out of the water tap?
[3:43:32.320 --> 3:43:41.320]  What are they going to be capable of doing if they already are acting violently just for fun with the entire system working?
[3:43:41.320 --> 3:43:47.320]  So I'm very concerned about the future, obviously, as you can see.
[3:43:47.320 --> 3:44:02.320]  But what can you do? You can prepare, you can have water, water purification systems, survivor food, try to learn how to grow, move away from the cities if you can.
[3:44:02.320 --> 3:44:08.320]  If at all possible, don't live in a high-rise building, those are the worst death traps of all.
[3:44:08.320 --> 3:44:19.320]  Imagine your building with no electricity. If you would have to haul water up flights and stairs, forget it. It's not survivable. It's not sustainable.
[3:44:19.320 --> 3:44:29.320]  So I just encourage people to possibly think about what would happen if your oil or your electric heat went out, your furnace is cold.
[3:44:29.320 --> 3:44:34.320]  Do you live in a place where everything just will freeze like the old Trapper and Jeremiah Johnson?
[3:44:34.320 --> 3:44:43.320]  It doesn't matter if you're inside of a building. In Sarajevo, during the winter, in Sarajevo, there was probably no colder than, say, Ohio,
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:51.320]  in Sarajevo, they were first burning their furniture right inside of the apartments, then tearing apart their door frames,
[3:44:51.320 --> 3:44:57.320]  and tearing apart anything they could to burn. They cut down all the trees in the city to burn.
[3:44:57.320 --> 3:45:04.320]  That was just an average city comparable to some city in Ohio or Indiana.
[3:45:04.320 --> 3:45:16.320]  So what happens? We're going to kick to a report in a little bit, and we'll see where this all ends.
[3:45:16.320 --> 3:45:25.320]  I hope that I'm still broadcasting and writing years from now, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if something happens in the meantime
[3:45:25.320 --> 3:45:28.320]  to upset the entire Apple cart.
[3:45:28.320 --> 3:45:36.320]  A lot of us agree with you, Mr. Bracken. I wanted to speak a little bit about this report before we throw to it,
[3:45:36.320 --> 3:45:46.320]  and this is something that I think you have been instrumental in helping shape, like Alex said earlier, pointing out some of these false flags.
[3:45:46.320 --> 3:45:57.320]  But this report is also going to showcase a lot of the fake news that the media has been putting out to destabilize this country as a whole.
[3:45:57.320 --> 3:46:01.320]  And here we are. Here's this report.
[3:46:01.320 --> 3:46:16.320]  I saw one of the best compilations on YouTube, so I had it posted to infowars.com. It's from Truth Revolt. We've put out some of these similar compilations, so I thought I would take these clips and basically rub it in to a few of them.
[3:46:16.320 --> 3:46:25.320]  So let's kick off the celebration of the mainstream media being a complete joke and being proven to be the captains, the lords, the creators,
[3:46:25.320 --> 3:46:32.320]  those that have fathered and mothered fake news and arrogant propaganda rotting in the midday sun.
[3:46:32.320 --> 3:46:38.320]  There's not going to be a President Donald Trump. That's not going to happen.
[3:46:38.320 --> 3:46:45.320]  Donald Trump will not become president!
[3:46:45.320 --> 3:46:54.320]  He's not going to be president. He is not. Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States. Take it to the bank. I guarantee it.
[3:46:54.320 --> 3:46:59.320]  I don't know which one of these stuck-up monsters is more ridiculous.
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:07.320]  The arrogant Sanders, who famously told us that white people don't know what it's like to be poor, white people don't know what it's like to be poor,
[3:47:07.320 --> 3:47:18.320]  or Clooney, who are so ignorant and so arrogant, they don't understand that when they produce these videos saying vote for Hillary or ban guns,
[3:47:18.320 --> 3:47:25.320]  they only get four or five, six thousand views now, whereas one of my videos gets hundreds of thousands, millions, or tens of millions.
[3:47:25.320 --> 3:47:35.320]  Again, you're a joke. No one wants to hear what you have to say because you're some actor that remembers the lines that the big corporate chiefs get you.
[3:47:35.320 --> 3:47:37.320]  We know you're frauds.
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:45.320]  He's not going to be president. He is not. Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States. Take it to the bank. I guarantee it.
[3:47:45.320 --> 3:47:49.320]  All right, all right. I think if he becomes a president, he'll make it great because the state is already...
[3:47:49.320 --> 3:47:57.320]  I think that man will be president of the United States right about the time that space ships come down filled with dinosaurs and red capes.
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:47:59.320]  I might not, Tom.
[3:47:59.320 --> 3:48:01.320]  Take it from there. How about that?
[3:48:01.320 --> 3:48:13.320]  Tom Hanks, you're the only dinosaur wearing a red cape around here. You're the only grand faloon, the arrogant narcissist that thinks we want to hear what you have to say.
[3:48:13.320 --> 3:48:18.320]  You're the guy that comes out with these books and TV shows about only one guy killing Kennedy.
[3:48:18.320 --> 3:48:27.320]  Hey, Jackass, in almost every poll, over 90% know the government killed Kennedy, and the guy that ran the operation to kill him gave a deathbed to the fashion.
[3:48:27.320 --> 3:48:35.320]  Do you understand that, Tom Hanks? We know all you do is read off a teleprompter, and you're not the people you play in your movies.
[3:48:35.320 --> 3:48:38.320]  You're a fake person that plays fake people.
[3:48:38.320 --> 3:48:40.320]  And then, of course, there's Donald Trump.
[3:48:40.320 --> 3:48:47.320]  Donald Trump has been saying that he will run for president as a Republican, which is surprising since I just assumed he was running as a joke.
[3:48:55.320 --> 3:49:08.320]  This has got to be one of my favorite clips because you've got Trump there with his family throughout the night at one of these big Obama press centers making fun of him, attacking him, pulling him to the mud.
[3:49:08.320 --> 3:49:16.320]  And Trump understands it's what he stands for. It's what he believes in. He knows he's right. He knows these are bought and paid for sycophants.
[3:49:16.320 --> 3:49:27.320]  And he stands up against this like a knight in shining armor. And that's the reason I love Trump so much is he breaks the spell of the stuck-up globalists.
[3:49:27.320 --> 3:49:33.320]  Donald Trump, just last week, he confirmed to the National Review that he is again considering a run in 2016.
[3:49:33.320 --> 3:49:49.320]  Do it. Do it. Look at me. Do it. I will personally write you a campaign check now on behalf of this country, which does not want you to be president, but which badly wants you to run.
[3:49:49.320 --> 3:50:00.320]  So when you stand and deliver that State of the Union address in no part of your mind or brain, can you imagine Donald Trump standing up one day and delivering a State of the Union address?
[3:50:00.320 --> 3:50:06.320]  Well, I can imagine it in a Saturday night's skit.
[3:50:06.320 --> 3:50:17.320]  You gotta love Obama and Matt Lauer and John Oliver. I mean, all these guys are just the same. They sit there in a confidence game saying it will not be Trump.
[3:50:17.320 --> 3:50:32.320]  And Hillary, of course, got caught stealing five states from Trump and having a bunch of illegals and dead people vote. But still, she lost. Still, the tidal wave was so big that all of these frauds' confidence game folded.
[3:50:32.320 --> 3:50:35.320]  I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president.
[3:50:35.320 --> 3:50:38.320]  He will never be president of the United States.
[3:50:38.320 --> 3:50:50.320]  You gotta love the liar, Elizabeth Warren, who claims she's a Native American, can't prove any of it. Up there, give it us the same piece of fraud, old Pocahontas, arrogantly instructing you like you're a child.
[3:50:50.320 --> 3:51:01.320]  But remember a few weeks ago, Michelle Obama came out and said her constituents are like children who were scared by Trump being elected by her and her lies, and so you have to comfort them like their little children.
[3:51:01.320 --> 3:51:05.320]  No, it's you that are delusional and act like little children, sweetheart.
[3:51:05.320 --> 3:51:15.320]  And we better be ready for the fact that he might be leaving the Republican ticket next. I know you don't believe that, but I want to go on.
[3:51:15.320 --> 3:51:29.320]  Oh, I just love Clinton's former chief of staff, Stephanophilus, with a gaggle of liars laughing at us like we're in junior high to make us feel bad and like we're not in the cool kid table at lunch.
[3:51:29.320 --> 3:51:34.320]  Hey, I wanted to get out of high school, bro, before I was in high school.
[3:51:34.320 --> 3:51:40.320]  Okay, here we are. And which Republican candidate has the best chance of winning the general election?
[3:51:40.320 --> 3:51:43.320]  Of the declared ones right now, Donald Trump.
[3:51:43.320 --> 3:52:07.320]  How you feeling now, Bill Maher? How you feeling the rest of his minions on the show when Ann Coulter could see what was coming from a trillion miles away? How you feeling now as countries all over the world pull out of globalism and pull out of the TPP and the unelected EU?
[3:52:07.320 --> 3:52:17.320]  How you feeling now? See, you are the people that are delusional. You all get together and try to convince yourselves that we want your globalist system. We don't.
[3:52:17.320 --> 3:52:26.320]  And so, right now, Mr. Trump, to answer your call for political honesty, I just want to say, you're not going to be president, all right?
[3:52:26.320 --> 3:52:39.320]  It's been fun. It's been great. I love you. But come on, come on, buddy. All let's say cow poo poo aside.
[3:52:39.320 --> 3:52:46.320]  There is zero chance we'll be seeing you being sworn in on the Capitol steps with your hand on a giant golden Bible.
[3:52:46.320 --> 3:53:03.320]  Colbert, again, is one of my favorites. They're talking about canceling his show because the ratings just go down and down and down and down. This is a guy who's a fake reporter playing a fake reporter who now warns the public about fake news.
[3:53:03.320 --> 3:53:07.320]  But of course, that was after he told us there was no way that Trump could win.
[3:53:07.320 --> 3:53:19.320]  I'll make a prediction note for you. I don't really get into predictions much, but this one I'll go way out on a limb. Donald Trump will never, ever be president of the United States.
[3:53:19.320 --> 3:53:25.320]  The Trump should not be in this race. He's an absurdity. He is a travesty.
[3:53:25.320 --> 3:53:29.320]  Donald Trump will never be elected president of the United States.
[3:53:29.320 --> 3:53:38.320]  Oh, there goes Ronald Reagan's son that isn't his son, uses his name, but then runs around stabbing conservatives in the back. And there goes Harry Reid.
[3:53:38.320 --> 3:53:43.320]  Harry Reid said that, you know, the time of liberty is dead, but he's the one now leaving the Senate.
[3:53:43.320 --> 3:54:02.320]  Donald Trump is here today, going tomorrow, candidate for president of the United States. Donald Trump is not going to be president of the United States. Of a respectful of the fact that the people have not voted, he's not going to be president of the United States.
[3:54:02.320 --> 3:54:11.320]  And of course, there's Don Carleone's daughter, Nancy Pelosi, that told us that Trump's here today, gone tomorrow.
[3:54:11.320 --> 3:54:15.320]  Let's be clear, Donald Trump will lose the election.
[3:54:15.320 --> 3:54:22.320]  He had a really good chance to be different and really have a chance to change things, but he doesn't do the work. He's lazy.
[3:54:22.320 --> 3:54:28.320]  And then Fareed Zarkaria, the Bilderberg group member, who tells us we should have open borders in world government.
[3:54:28.320 --> 3:54:38.320]  Oh, and don't forget Mark Cuban, who looks like he's wearing some rubber mask over his head, running around throwing fits everywhere because Donald Trump got elected.
[3:54:38.320 --> 3:54:41.320]  We talk about him every day and we continuously bash him.
[3:54:41.320 --> 3:54:44.320]  He's not going to be the president. Don't worry about it.
[3:54:44.320 --> 3:54:54.320]  Oh, the harpies on the view, talking to all the unemployed women that watch their show. Hey, message, those unemployed women want jobs again.
[3:54:54.320 --> 3:54:59.320]  They don't want to sit around and watch the view, sweetheart.
[3:54:59.320 --> 3:55:10.320]  But I guess the view did learn the lesson of Joan Rivers. If you talk about Michelle being a tranny and basically having a bigger one than Long Dong Silver, you end up dead.
[3:55:10.320 --> 3:55:18.320]  This will be a wake-up call for the Republican Party. Despite Boris thinking that Donald Trump could win New York, the president's race is over.
[3:55:18.320 --> 3:55:22.320]  Can I just cut through? I have one thing to say, one thing only.
[3:55:22.320 --> 3:55:30.320]  And that is that this race is over. Tomorrow morning, the money will dry up. The Republicans will start to hide.
[3:55:30.320 --> 3:55:37.320]  Trump has no place to go. This race, effectively, as of tonight, is no longer a presidential race.
[3:55:37.320 --> 3:55:42.320]  I mean, everything I know about presidential politics, and I've been through five of them.
[3:55:42.320 --> 3:55:46.320]  I've never seen one like this. This race is over. You might as well accept it.
[3:55:46.320 --> 3:55:59.320]  And the question now is, how do you minimize damage? And the only way you can do that, it seems to me, is to try to grab hold some old conservative value things and do what Mondial did in 1984, which will try to save a few people down in ballot.
[3:55:59.320 --> 3:56:04.320]  But as far as Donald Trump's concern, it will never, ever, ever happen.
[3:56:04.320 --> 3:56:18.320]  What happened CNN? You told her that Donald Trump wasn't going to win. He tried to create the false bandwagon idea that it'd be a thrown away vote. But it was your demonization of Trump that got him elected, losers.
[3:56:18.320 --> 3:56:28.320]  But in summation, let's end with President Obama telling us that, again, Trump would never be president.
[3:56:28.320 --> 3:56:38.320]  President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States, exclamation point at real Donald Trump.
[3:56:38.320 --> 3:56:48.320]  Well, at real Donald Trump, at least I will go down as a president.
[3:56:48.320 --> 3:56:58.320]  Oh my gosh, I've never seen anyone drop the mic. I mean, when you say that, that means it's a fact. It means Obamacare is free.
[3:56:58.320 --> 3:57:08.320]  It means that Obama hung the stars and the moon. It means that Hillary and Obamacare are just there to help you and your family. My gosh, that was powerful stuff.
[3:57:08.320 --> 3:57:22.320]  Oh, but what are you going to do now that calling everybody that supported Trump or lower taxes was racist or everybody that said that Obamacare was a scam was racist? What are you going to do now when you've already scraped the bottom of the barrel and said everybody's a homophobe?
[3:57:22.320 --> 3:57:25.320]  Oh, I know. We're all Russian agents.
[3:57:25.320 --> 3:57:45.320]  He wants to help me. No, no, you've got to be sent for reprogramming. Russian scum.
[3:57:45.320 --> 3:58:12.320]  I never get tired of those clips. Never. This is the season of Schadenfreude. I hope it lasts. I hope that this is the second coming of Trump.
[3:58:12.320 --> 3:58:22.320]  Thanks for the opportunity to have me on today. My first shot at this. Thanks, Alex. It gives me a great appreciation for your ability to go straight through like that.
[3:58:22.320 --> 3:58:34.320]  Anybody that wants to know more about me, I'm Matt Bracken. My website is enemiesfarnanddomestic.com. You can read all about my stuff, my books, my short stories, my essays there.
[3:58:34.320 --> 3:58:47.320]  And I'll tell you what, Ann Coulter, you get the Gutsy Award. You were the only one that took those laughs face to face. It must have hurt along with the roast where they called you the vile things.
[3:58:47.320 --> 3:59:05.320]  But you've got my respect forever.
