[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:29.000]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.000]  It's Sunday, July 16th, 2023.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  Owen Schroyer takes the baton in two hours.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  The Sunday Live.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  Well, every broadcast, as I say, is important.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  But particular ones are even more important.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000]  And as the world quickens with all the insanity,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  and evil really rises, but good to challenge it,
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  as Newtonian physics and the Bible tells us is true,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  for every action there's an opposite and equal reaction,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  each successive week and month and year gets more intense.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  This really is a quickening or a cascade of many singularities
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000]  towards the great singularity, the return of our Lord and Savior, Christ Jesus.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]  Well, RFK Jr. has come out and talked about something we talked about
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]  two and a half years ago.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000]  Major scientific institutions in Europe, the United States, India, Australia,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  and Japan, of all places, they have a lot of great scientists there,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]  looked at the COVID-19 virus and said it's been made in a lab.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]  I mean, they said three and a half years ago, the Indians first scanned it,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]  at their prestigious biomedical university,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]  where they have a multi-billion dollar gene editing reader computer,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  and they said this is man-made, this is five viruses, we know who made it,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  and this is what it's been designed to do.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]  And then they got billions in research funding threatened,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  so they pulled their report but didn't say it was false.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  Then the French, the discoverer of HIV, Nobel Prize winner,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  he ran it through a gene scanner that cost, again, two billion dollars,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  just the machine itself, and said, no, this is completely man-made with the HIV delivery system.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  And then it took about a year for the scientists to then look at it more closely,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]  and they said it's designed to hit black people and white people,
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  it's called a race-specific weapon.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000]  Now, RFK Jr. came out and said this a few days ago at a big dinner conference in New York,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  and it became a huge firestorm because he just said what the report said,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]  that it spares Asians and Ashkenazi Jews,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]  because Ashkenazi Jews, somewhere back in their lineage,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]  that's what Arabs really are, is a mix of Caucasian, African, and Asian.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  That's really what their genetic type is, so they're a mix of the three.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  Just like an indigenous person from Mexico or Guatemala,
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  if you test their genetics, it's Chinese.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  That's where they came from thousands and thousands of years ago.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]  It's a genetic complete match, Chinese.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  They don't really teach that in school, though,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  but that's a mainline thing in biosciences.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]  Spaniards are Germanic and Gaulish until they got invaded
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  and held for several hundred years by the North African Moors,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  who were a mix of African and Arabic.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]  So that's why you see the change in the Spanish there.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  So ethnic studies are very interesting, not in the leftist ethnic studies,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  but actually the historical ethnic studies and then bioweapons.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]  As Dick Cheney wrote in 2000 in Rebuilding America's Defenses
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]  for the Project for the American Century document,
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  got wide circulation, look it up for yourself,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000]  he said the U.S. government must legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]  So R.F.K. Jr. talked about how this appears to be a race-specific bioweapon.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  He just stated what the papers say,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  and now we're hearing he's an anti-Semite, absolutely preposterous.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]  Of course, he supports the state of Israel, just like Trump, whole nine yards.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  Some would say he's just too pro-Israel.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]  I make that point just to point out that he is definitely not against the Jews.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  But it's just a fact.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  HIV absolutely targets black people.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  That's been out for 40 years.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  And this one targets blacks and whites.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  Because if you look at the genetic derivation,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]  we look a lot different.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]  Blacks and whites are more closely related than to Asians.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  Asians are the most separate group,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  in fact the only group that has physiological differences
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  that blacks and whites do not have.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  Stay with us.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]  The globalists are only humans.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000]  They have a lot of power, but they can be defeated.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]  But some of their operations are going to take decades to stop.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]  But one thing you can do right now
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000]  is take control of your body and your family's body
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]  by purifying the water that you drink and that you cook with.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]  And you do it with the highest quality gravity-fed filter out there.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]  You can sit there and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]  It purifies very quickly and it cuts out thousands of chemicals
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  to non-detectable levels.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  It's the very best system out there for the lowest price,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]  for a limited time, 10% off on top of that.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]  Exclusively at Infowarsstore.com on the Alexa Pure water filtration system
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000]  in stock and replacement filters for folks that need those in stock.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]  Get it today and it funds the Infowars.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]  This is one of the main areas we can take control of our lives
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]  and stop the globalists from hitting us with poison
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]  that they allow in the water supply.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]  In some cases, they add the water supply like fluoride.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  It's Sunday, July 16th, 2023.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  All right, we've got massive news tonight.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  R.O.K. Jr. has talked about the elephant in the room,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]  the race-specific bioweapon nature of COVID-19
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]  designed to target blacks and whites.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]  It'll still kill Asians and Ashkenazi Jews,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  but not at anywhere at the same rate.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]  According to major studies, he quoted that.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]  He just pointed out it looks like the Chi-Coms and the globalists
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]  were developing a specific race weapon.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]  And, wow, you're not supposed to talk about that,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]  even though you can look up Dick Cheney rebuilding America's defenses.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]  PNAC, the year 2000, legitimizing the use of race-specific weapons.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  In fact, guys, give me a print out of that.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]  Just type in Dick Cheney promoted race-specific bioweapons.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]  You'll get articles. Just click web.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]  They're like 20-something years old.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]  Okay, so we're going to be hitting that.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  And we have the biolabs.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000]  The Pentagon now admits that Obama did set up in Ukraine
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]  that are developing race weapons to kill Russians.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  So we're going to be tying those stories together.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:38.000]  You've all heard of ESGs and this environmental social score
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]  that's in so much trouble because it's so tyrannical
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  and so evil with a casual society.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.000]  But what is the ESG trying to merge with
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  and take orders from?
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]  We're talking about something that doesn't get enough attention,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  and that is going to be the Sustainable Development Systems, the SDG.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]  We've got the UN head saying that the supercomputers and AI
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  are going to rule your life
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:11.000]  and that they're going to enforce the ESG system of the SDG.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  And while we're at it, we will plow into exactly what that means
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  in that UN report I showed you yesterday in a special emergency report,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]  and we showed it on Friday, where in that UN report
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  they say they're going to cut energy in the world by 50%,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]  energy period, no matter where you get it,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  to, quote, save the planet.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  That'll kill billions of people.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]  Most people have about 5% discretionary income in the third world,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  maybe 10% in the Western world.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]  How do you get your energy cut by 50%
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  when it's already, on average, around a third your cost of living?
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  That is death for billions, and I have numbers on that for you.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]  But that's okay.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  Kamala Harris said the quiet part out loud,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  watch Kamala Harris call for depopulation during climate speech.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  We'll be getting to those quotes.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  And I thought I'd show you the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]  saying we're really a depopulation foundation
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000]  and giving Bill Gates an award for depopulating people.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]  And if you don't believe in Global Depopulation Agenda,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  then we have something interesting for you.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]  These are bibliographed, documented, vetted quotes.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  Many of these I was reading when I was 18, 19 years old
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  and didn't believe it, so I went to the library.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  They didn't have it, so I went to the UT library
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]  that did have it or had them sent off for it.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  I actually got the books where they said these things,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]  how they're going to set up world government
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  and how they're going to kill your family.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]  That's from UNESCO Courier.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]  That's the UNESCO United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization's
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]  official newspaper.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  Our American burdens each.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]  One American burdens the earth
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]  much more than 20 Bangladeshians.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  This is a terrible thing to say in order to stabilize world population.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  We must eliminate 350,000 people per day.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  It's a horrible thing to say, but it's just as bad not to say it.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  That's Jacques Cousteau in the United Nations Courier.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  And of course they've made the decision to first wipe out the first world
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  and then they'll wipe out the third world,
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]  but there'll be nowhere for the third world to run
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  once the Globals have taken down the first world.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]  We're going to read you more of those loving quotes
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  like Prince Philip, King Charles' father, saying things even worse.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]  Continuing, we've got major news
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  on what the cult of psychology and psychiatry is doing in the United States.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  You can always hear about these psychologists and psychiatrists
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]  that got caught having sex with their patients.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  And it's been reported by CNN, you name it,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]  therapy where the clothes come off.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  So that's not just pedophilia for the kids.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  It's having sex with your therapist, but it's okay.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]  It's professional.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]  49-year-old transgender biological male runner
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]  takes the bronze medal away from woman at Para World Championships.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  Look at this dude.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]  And if you say that in many jurisdictions, you go to jail.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]  Yep, got to let men invade women's spaces.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  And the U.N. says they support women, don't they?
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  So, they mean the new woman.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000]  So that's coming up.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]  Russia Duma, that's their Congress,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]  bans all gender reassignment surgeries.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]  We're going to be reading through that article why they're doing it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  And R.L.K.'s at it again.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  He's Alex Jones 2.0.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.000]  R.L.K. Jr., climate change is being used to control us through fear
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]  and is not dealing with real environmental problems,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  but is a giant Ponzi scheme by central banks across the world
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  to bring in total surveillance and control and end industrial societies
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]  and consolidate power and wealth in the hands of a few.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  Yep, totally true.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  So, I want to say he's totally defected over to our side.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  And you wouldn't be saying stuff like that unless you had really defected
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]  because the globalists never pose like us and then say that much.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  They never go that far.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  They're more of a Mike Pence.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  I love the Lord.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  Everything's fine.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000]  Take your microchip.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:06.000]  Just more of, yes, I'm very conservative.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]  Went to church three times this week.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  Yes, sir.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]  And it's all, look how good I am, but not actually attacking meat and potato issues.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]  And that's why Trump calls him a very smart person
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  and a real populace of the people.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  Yes, both men are.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  But by the way, I don't like bashing the Santas
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]  even though he's got some seedy Republican nerdy walls around him.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  That's what the Republican establishment is.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  And I like his policies.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]  Luckily, he stands for it.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]  He came out with Tucker and said the first thing he'll do is kill the ESGs
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]  and the carbon taxes and the rest of it.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]  That's good.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000]  Let's not let Trump and the Santas destroy each other.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]  Plus, Trump's 30, 40 points ahead of him.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]  The Santas has been crushed.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  So, let him get a little limelight.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]  Let's not be too mad at him because we need good people like him, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  I think he's a good person.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  And let me look.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  I don't totally trust Elon Musk, but he's going in the right direction.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000]  As long as he's going in the right direction, it's fine.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]  There's an old saying they had around the world
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000]  when the British empire was in complete control
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  and the British were known for being so aggressive and murderous,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000]  at least on the open seas,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.000]  that if you ever scratch a Englishman,
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  you find a pirate underneath
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]  because they would haul down the British flag
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  and then they'd haul up the Jolly Roger.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]  That was most of your pirates were British, or a lot of them at least.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]  And they would letter a mark, jump back and forth, false flagging people.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  The British were just the best at it over time.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  And so that's why they were able to rule.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  Tell Britannia, Britannia rules the waves.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]  And of course, you know why the sun never set on the British empire, right?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000]  Because God wouldn't trust an Englishman in the dark.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  That's really good, actually, isn't it?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000]  But continuing, I don't trust any of these people at the end of the day.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000]  I trust my mom. I trust my dad.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  Maybe I trust my wife.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]  I mean, I love her and care about her, but I'm not quite sure about that.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  I'm joking. Maybe not.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  But you know what I mean.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  I trust my mother and my father.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  And I love my children, and they're pretty good.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]  But I've still seen them do some weird stuff.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:14.000]  And I think I trust the crew.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]  The crew we've got now, we've been through a lot together.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]  I mean that.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  But at the end of the day, when someone's going in the right direction,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  you need to support their right action and encourage it.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]  And then you'll usually get a lot more of that instead of like,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]  Well, I'm not sure they're not controlled opposition.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  Well then, let's see you get out there and be the opposition.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  That's the same thing for sound of freedom.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]  I love Greg Reese.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  Skip this break.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  I think he's a really smart guy.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  I don't put prior constraints on my reporters.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000]  I hire them because I trust them and I like them.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  And they'll tend to vet stuff amongst each other.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  And every once in a while,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000]  Reese puts out something I don't totally agree with.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]  He put out a report.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]  Let's just cover this now.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  I'm going to put it on screen if you can find it.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  It's his last report.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000]  Dealing with the sound of freedom.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:58.000]  And he didn't say the sound of freedom or bad people.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  He didn't say any of that.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]  He just said, look, they list the federal agency
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]  and international groups set up by the Clintons
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]  back during the Clinton administration in the 90s
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]  that has been caught covering up and running things.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]  And so how are they listing an organization
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  that has been involved in this stuff?
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]  I mean, the head of the,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  deputy head of the Clinton Foundation,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  remember, got caught smuggling kids out of Haiti.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  And she went to prison for a few years
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  and then changed her name
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000]  and does head in the Amber Alert system.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  So yeah, if you're going to be kidnapping kids
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]  and grabbing kids,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  you want to be in control of the people
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  trying to find them through the database.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000]  But that's the only database to report it to.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.000]  So what are you supposed to do?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000]  It's like the FBI at the top is corrupt.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  Well, if somebody, you saw a bank get robbed,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  you call the local police, they call the FBI or vice versa.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  It's who you have to report to.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  People are like, well, this movie points people
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]  at this organization.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]  And I agree, we should expose the organization,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  look at what it's done,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  but it's got some good people in it as well.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]  It's like they catch border patrol agents sometimes
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]  involve smuggling kids or drugs.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  Is the whole border patrol bad?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  All I'm saying is yes,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.000]  all the major institutions are corrupt,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]  but they're the institutions that are there.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  It's like the border patrol is there
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  basically assisting smuggling of humans.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  And they said, the union has said,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000]  if we don't follow orders and all quit,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  there'll be no control down there.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]  Would you rather that?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  And a lot of folks are quitting saying,
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  yeah, that's the right thing to do.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]  All I'm saying is you've got to look at the larger issues.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]  But the name of the video was Angel Studios
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  directing people to Clinton Podesta NGO.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  And I want to play that in a moment
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]  because it's an important report
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]  and you should know all the facets to it
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]  and understand it.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000]  And it does go further as well.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  But let me tell you,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000]  the pitos aren't happy about this movie
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  and they're very scared of it
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  and they've tried to block it.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000]  And just in my gut, in my spirit,
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  I think it's a good movie and good people.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]  We know the inside baseball.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]  I knew about this before.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]  I was told about it in the last few days
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  and told not to tell anybody
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  because it was inside baseball.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]  But I didn't get it from that source.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  So I'm going to go ahead and tell you.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.000]  Of course, there's infighting within
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  the people that made the movie
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]  and the Underground Railroad.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  And I had people involved,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000]  that were involved saving kidnapped kids
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  all over Latin America and other areas,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  come to me when I was promoting
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]  the Underground Railroad five years ago
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  and say, listen, they're not bad.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  They're not smuggling kids.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]  But it's more of like a PR firm
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]  and they buy kids from smugglers.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]  And so that's actually creating a market
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  and we don't think it's good
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  in Army Special Operations.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  And I got a visit with some of the folks
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  in Army Special Operations
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  that were actually over operations in Texas
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  with the governor down at the Super Bowl then.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  And they reported to me
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  how the police department at the top
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  is controlled and how they're involved,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  you know, allowing the sex trade,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  not just in adult women,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  but in children there
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000]  and that I should investigate that.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  And strangely enough,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  I knew from other sources
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]  about those allegations
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  separately in another city
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000]  when the police chief was there.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000]  And this was not from law enforcement.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]  This was from people that saw it.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]  It wasn't children, but it was women
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000]  and it was the police.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000]  So yes, this is going on.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  Yes, this is very serious.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000]  And yes, it's bone chilling
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]  and, you know, sends a tremor up your spine.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]  And at the same time,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]  when we've been sent child porn,
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]  not just the time it came up in the news
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000]  because an unopened one,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]  an unopened email that the other side,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  the Global Scot through Discovery,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  they then scanned for metadata
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]  and found a hidden link.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000]  And then, you know, the news basically said,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000]  oh, Alex Jones sent child porn
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000]  to the families of Sandy Hook,
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.000]  which is totally untrue.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  The FBI issued a letter saying,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]  which they don't normally do,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000]  I appreciate that, saying,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000]  no, Jones is the victim.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  Free speech is the victim.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  They did not send that.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  Knowingly, it was unopened in a discovery package
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.000]  and then the other side basically found it,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]  interestingly enough.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]  But the point there was
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]  we were directed by the FBI.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  Other times that people would send child porn to us
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  because there were times where producers did open links
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]  and it was there and it was very traumatizing.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000]  It happened to one producer just twice.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  He had to quit over it
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  just because he saw those images
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]  and the FBI directed us to report it
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000]  to two different organizations
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]  and one of it was the group
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]  that they're directing people to in this movie.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  That's where you're supposed to direct it
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  to the international group
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]  and the national group.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  There's a big private group
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]  that looks at the exploitation of children
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]  as well, so that's what you do.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  So I have reported this to the same people
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  that this movie is reporting it to
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  because that's the avenue there is, okay?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]  When I've had one federal agency
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]  try to set me up posing as Russian agents,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]  I'll leave it at that,
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  I did go to the FBI
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]  because I didn't know if it was them or the CIA.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]  Later learned it was the CIA
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:03.000]  and I wasn't going to be set up
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000]  and I had them try to set me up
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]  but the sex operative wants to
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  and I went to the FBI on that
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  and not because I think the FBI is perfect.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]  I'm getting it on record that this isn't true
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  and I'm here, you know,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]  here's the text messages,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]  here's the setup
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  and I'm not going to be set up in this.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  So I just use it as a reporting mechanism
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]  to get it on record, okay?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]  So this is a very dangerous operation.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]  People don't realize what you go through
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.000]  when you do this
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000]  and I think Caviezel is a great person,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  I think Ballard is a great person
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]  and I think everybody that had the courage
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]  to put this film out are great people
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]  but that said, everybody has a right to their opinion
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000]  and I respect Greg Rees
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000]  so just like he has his right,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  this operation I built,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]  I respect him to say what he thinks
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000]  and I think it's always within the bounds
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.000]  of reasonable discussion
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.000]  and I have the right to then say
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  that I don't totally agree with the angle
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]  though I think it's a healthy discussion to have
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]  and I just want to complete it
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  by stating that we have reported things
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]  to this very group and organization
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]  which is indeed at the top controlled by the bad guys.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.000]  Make no mistake
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]  and that's really my criticism of the film
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  is that it doesn't go far enough
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]  in the entire equation
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]  of pointing out that it's major federal agencies
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]  and organizations and groups at the top
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]  that are actually using pedophilia
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:24.000]  to corrupt and control people.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]  Two years ago it came out that
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]  hundreds of small town mayors,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000]  council leaders, tribal leaders
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]  in Afghanistan, the preferred mode of control
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]  by the Central Intelligence Agency
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]  that spent hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]  in the almost 20 years we were there,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]  the preferred mode was to put pedophiles in charge
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]  and then they had to supply them
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]  with young children and drugs
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]  and the reason the CIA got caught was
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]  the budgets were so large
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000]  securing the children
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]  and the drugs for these Islamic lunatics
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.000]  that they were putting in charge
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000]  because everybody says Islam is so good
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]  and so anti-pedophile
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]  and grassroots Muslims like in Dearborn
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  and I salute them are saying no
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  no flag flies here with the state flag
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.000]  the POW flag, the American flag above it, we're Americans
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]  and we're not going to have pedo teaching in our schools
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000]  because mainline Muslims are not into that
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  but there's an old thing with the tribal chiefs
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]  and even going back to Mohammed
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]  and the rest of it about
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]  well homosexuality is punishable by death
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.000]  unless it's a young boy before puberty
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  and so that's in the Quran folks
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]  yeah, and so it's just rampant
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]  and so there's the CIA
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.000]  but then wait, there's a lot of people in the CIA
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  that have been good
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]  like Terry Reed who we had many times
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000]  Clinton Bush the CIA was on record
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]  the guy training people to fly the airplanes
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000]  from South America with the cocaine
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]  into Mina, Arkansas
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]  and he went public when they killed those kids
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]  that were witnesses to the cocaine drop
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000]  so he's a great guy, worked for the CIA
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  my uncle, Army Special Operations
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]  did work for the CIA
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]  he got out of it because of human trafficking
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  and child smuggling
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]  and the whole nine yards
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]  and helped wake me up, in fact probably the biggest influence of my life
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]  when it comes to, there wouldn't be an Alex Jones today doing this
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  it wasn't for William Forrest Hammond
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]  so then they go, well Ballard was in the CIA
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000]  okay, what does that mean?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]  I mean the CIA is like saying
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]  again, oh he works at Walmart
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]  I mean the CIA is gigantic
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  the CIA tried to recruit my wife
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]  at the University of Washington
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  she said she wanted to sign up for humanitarian work
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000]  she wanted to work for the UN someday
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]  to help children
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]  and then about two years into it
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  the professor brings him in and says, well we're really a CIA project
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]  and you know, you've been chosen now
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]  to go into this new project with Microsoft
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]  and then she did it for a while
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  and then thought it was all a bunch of BS
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  and got out of it
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]  and it's not like, ooh, his wife's so special
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  Alex Jones' second wife worked in a program
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000]  the whole thing, folks
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000]  my dad was 14, taught in his class
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  interning all these whiz kid contests
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]  Union Carbide sent him an 18 wheeler
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]  with a whole laser set up
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000]  after he passed one test
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]  and said, okay, can you build this laser
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]  this ruby laser, and he did
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000]  and then won that, it's like Last Starfighter or something
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]  where you're playing the game and you don't get it
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000]  it's the big guys watching
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]  and then they took him to UT at 15
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]  and
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000]  uh
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]  thought he was working for NASA
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  he didn't complete it and got out of it
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]  by the time he was about 20
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]  it's everywhere, folks, it's the real government
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]  it's the real system
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]  we don't have time
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  to get to all of Greg's full report here
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]  and I kind of went off the rails on this
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]  go ahead and play what we can of the report
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  and then we'll add the rest in post and we'll come back
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  here it is
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]  Music
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000]  Many good hearted people
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000]  have strong emotions about the environment
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.000]  and their emotions are so strong
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]  that they have been manipulated
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  by a corrupt government
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]  to castrate themselves
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000]  and castrate their own children
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.000]  to save the earth from climate change
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]  this should teach us something
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]  about our emotions
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]  they can blind us from logic and reason
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]  and we all have them
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]  this report is not a critique of the film
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]  the sound of freedom
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]  I saw this film and I appreciate
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.000]  that it is bringing awareness to a subject
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]  that I personally
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]  have very strong emotions about
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]  this report is about a clear red flag
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]  that people should be aware of
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000]  so that we don't allow
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]  our emotions to blind us
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  from logic and reason
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]  according to MK Ultra
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]  Whistleblowers, the CIA
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]  acquired children for Project Monarch
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000]  by cataloging child
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]  pornography sent through the US
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]  mail and the only thing
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]  that's changed since then is that the world
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]  has gone digital
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]  the National Center for Missing and Exploited
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]  Children or the NCMEC
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]  went international
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]  in 1999
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  the ICMEC
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.000]  was launched by Hillary Clinton
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]  and Tony Blair
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  with Richard Branson acting as a founding
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  sponsor
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000]  it has now partnered with law enforcement
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:15.000]  in over 150 territories
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000]  including Interpol
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]  and Europol
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]  in 2009 the Clinton Global Initiative
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]  partnered with the Polaris Project
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]  and by 2014
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000]  they created a global
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]  modern day slavery
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  database of organizations
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]  in 199 countries
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]  to monitor human trafficking
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  also in 2009
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  Amber Ready Incorporated
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]  selected the Podesta Group
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.000]  the infamous pedophile
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]  art collectors of the
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000]  WikiLeaks Podesta email scandal
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]  to be their PR company
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]  where they were responsible for
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]  promoting Amber Ready cell phone
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]  technology which created a
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]  database of children so that
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]  if they ever were abducted
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  their information was already on file
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000]  once this
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.000]  child database syndicate
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000]  was launched human trafficking
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]  increased
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]  within 9 years the human trafficking
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]  industry went from around
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]  30 billion dollars a year
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]  to 150 billion dollars a year
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]  nearly all
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000]  child pornography is processed
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  and stored within this framework
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]  on foreign servers in Sweden
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]  in 2014
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]  President Obama assigned
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  the task of how to manage this
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000]  gathered intelligence data
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000]  to John Podesta
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:37.000]  the Clintons, the Podesta's
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  and their friends are demonstrably
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]  involved on the criminal side
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000]  of child sex trafficking
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]  if this is news to you
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]  I recommend my report from 2019
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000]  are the Clintons involved
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.000]  in human trafficking
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  which is based on the well researched
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]  article by Corey Diggs
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]  and it is this group who manage
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  and run Polaris
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]  the ICMEC and the
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]  ICMEC and these are the same
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000]  groups that Angel Studios
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  producers of The Sound of
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  Freedom are directing people
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  to as a way to combat
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]  child trafficking
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000]  the billionaire who has been funding Tim Ballard's
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]  operation is Carlos
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  Slim who has also funded
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]  Hillary Clinton and the Bill
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.000]  and Melinda Gates Foundation
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]  and if you believe that the Democrats
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  are the problem then I recommend
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]  you look into the Franklin cover up
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  and the Bohemian Grove
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]  Pedophilia is how the
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]  hidden hand controls
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]  their politician puppets
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]  awareness of this horrific problem
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000]  is good
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]  The globalists aren't just targeting
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000]  us through the poison shots
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]  or the electromagnetic 5G
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000]  or the GMO crops
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:09.000]  they're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]  that the EPA has authorized
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]  companies and industry to use
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]  one of the top pesticides used
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]  is Atrazine
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:19.000]  the allowable level the government admits
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000]  that they allow to be in your water supply
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]  is enough to sterilize you and basically turn
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  your son into a feminized mutant
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]  look it up
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000]  we have the very best gravity fed

[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]  and the fact that we're not caught flat footed
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000]  during their major takeover
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000]  is because of you
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  humanity has a real fighting chance

[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]  please take action
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  I love to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  but the one thing that I have really found
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]  that makes a difference
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000]  is brain force
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]  I'll take brain force in the morning
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]  right before I go to my computer
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]  and I'm good for the next 4 or 5 hours
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]  writing a whole lot of stuff
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  so it really is true that brain force
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  is something I use every day
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.000]  and it helps me with my writing
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]  alright we love you, we'll be right back

[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]  and your gums but your whole mouth, your throat and more
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  these are really game changing toothpaste
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]  they're very very strong
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]  most over the counter toothpaste have fluoride
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000]  ours don't and it doesn't have fillers in it
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000]  it is just chock full
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  of incredible things
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  so it's now back in stock
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.000]  it became a best seller
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000]  the turmeric toothpaste is available again
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]  at infowarsstore.com
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000]  we've got some of the tooth wine toothpaste, we've got some of that left
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]  and we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000]  in stock but it's running out as well
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]  so all 3 toothpastes in stock

[00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:28.470]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:34.470]  Let me finish up on the sound of freedom analysis that I was just engaging in last segment a
[00:33:34.470 --> 00:33:38.470]  few months ago. Then I'm going to move into the really huge breaking news dealing with
[00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:42.470]  race specific bioweapons. If you're a new lister, don't know what that is, you need to find out
[00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:47.470]  about it. It's a real thing on record, not debated. The corporate media, the enemy of
[00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:54.470]  the people, dinosaur, Decepticon media is trying to cover this up right now. They're
[00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:58.470]  really scared. Big news breaking on that front on multiple fronts coming up in just
[00:33:58.470 --> 00:34:06.470]  a few minutes. But a lot of people ask me, I mean a lot at the grocery store, at the gas station,
[00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:16.470]  at church, is Elon Musk for real? Is Tucker Carlson for real? Is Joe Rogan for real?
[00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:22.470]  And I can tell you with Joe Rogan, 100% real guy. Tucker Carlson, 100% real guy.
[00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:29.470]  They asked me, is Trump for real? 100% real guy. But Alex Jones, 100% real guy. 100% mean
[00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:36.470]  what I say, my own person, nobody. You know what defines Donald Trump, Alex Jones,
[00:34:36.470 --> 00:34:44.470]  Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, is that we like to be our own men. And nobody is telling
[00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:50.470]  us what to think or what to do. I mean, with Joe, it is to a ridiculous level.
[00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:55.470]  If anything, he's a little bit of a jerk about the fact that he's doing things exactly
[00:34:55.470 --> 00:35:00.470]  how he wants to, and you don't tell him how you think you ought to do it. I mean,
[00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:04.470]  no one is telling that guy what to do, okay? He's worked his whole life to get
[00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:08.470]  a position of where he's in charge of his life. And it's the same thing with Tucker
[00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:13.470]  Carlson. Nobody is telling him what to do. It's come out in internal emails how mad
[00:35:13.470 --> 00:35:16.470]  he was that they were trying to censor him, even though he had a contract and gave
[00:35:16.470 --> 00:35:22.470]  up two-thirds of the money to be free. And so I can tell you Tucker's good.
[00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.470]  Trump's the same way. Makes a lot of mistakes, but completely pig-headed.
[00:35:25.470 --> 00:35:30.470]  Nobody is telling him what to do. He's not getting orders. And you can say
[00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:34.470]  I'm pig-headed too. I mean, if somebody cheats me in business or life,
[00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:40.470]  I'd rather lose a million dollars than them get $5. And it's not a vindictive
[00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.470]  thing. But I didn't sell out to the New World Order for hundreds of millions
[00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:46.470]  of dollars and all their stupid power. I'm not going to sell out in little ways
[00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:52.470]  to other people, okay? I'm going to do what I believe is right
[00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:57.470]  and damn the consequences. Now, it's attitudes like that built the world,
[00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:01.470]  but I didn't get into this story I'm telling you or these examples to talk
[00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.470]  about Joe Rogan and myself, okay? Or to talk about Tucker Carlson.
[00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:09.470]  It's key to understand this because you asked me this the most. I mean,
[00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:13.470]  here's what I got to ask the most. Are these people for real? Are you for real?
[00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:18.470]  And the next biggest thing is why are you still alive? And then the next thing is
[00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:22.470]  what's the globalist going to pull next? And really everybody should be asking that.
[00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.470]  Like, what are they going to pull next and how do we stop them?
[00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:27.470]  And I tell people, do you ever listen to the show? And they go,
[00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:31.470]  yeah, I see clips or are you still on air? I see you all the time.
[00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.470]  Where are you? And I go, well, you look like a pretty smart person.
[00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.470]  You just walked over to my table. You're dressed nice.
[00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:40.470]  Got a nice looking wife and kids over here. You don't know how to go find my show?
[00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:44.470]  They're like, well, I mean, I guess info works. Well, yeah, you're asking if I'm still on the air.
[00:36:44.470 --> 00:36:50.470]  It's like until about 10 years ago, people would ask me, do I have a day job?
[00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:54.470]  Make films, write books on the air four hours a day, work seven days a week,
[00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:59.470]  reach hundreds of millions of people, conservatively, do I have a day job?
[00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:05.470]  Yeah, this is my day job. My main job is being a father.
[00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:09.470]  And doing what God tells me. And I'm not even bitching here. I'm trying people to think about priorities.
[00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.470]  So let me answer all those questions. Then I'll get into the bio weapon this next segment.
[00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:17.470]  But let me answer them because I think they're good questions.
[00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:22.470]  And I had to preface it with is Joe Rogan for real? Is Tucker Carlson for real? Is Trump for real?
[00:37:22.470 --> 00:37:26.470]  Yes, yes, yes, yes. Is Alex Jones real? Yes, yes, yes.
[00:37:26.470 --> 00:37:30.470]  And we make mistakes and we're not perfect. And we see through Rose color darkly,
[00:37:31.470 --> 00:37:36.470]  as the Bible tells us, and we're fallen creatures. Is RFK Jr. for real?
[00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:40.470]  I haven't never met him, don't know him, know some of his people.
[00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:45.470]  He was kind enough to say, we appreciate the show, too controversial, come on, they'll make you a distraction,
[00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.470]  but we really appreciate you. Told me that 10 years ago, told me that five years ago.
[00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:52.470]  They told me that a year ago. Fine. I appreciate you being honest about it.
[00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.470]  That's fine. You're doing great work. You're getting better and better every day.
[00:37:56.470 --> 00:37:59.470]  I believe RFK Jr. is absolutely for real.
[00:37:59.470 --> 00:38:02.470]  Now, does he have problems like his father and his uncle?
[00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.470]  These are alpha male, really smart, aggressive dudes. Yeah.
[00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:08.470]  Is he out to get humanity? No.
[00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:13.470]  He's for real. I can't say I know him for 25 years like Joe Rogan intimately,
[00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:18.470]  as good close friends, but I can tell you, I believe he's for real.
[00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:21.470]  I believe Trump's for real. No, Trump talked to him quite a bit over the years,
[00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.470]  but I can watch him and tell you, oh, they hate him because he's real.
[00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:27.470]  He doesn't do a thing they tell him.
[00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:30.470]  Is he on much for real? I don't know.
[00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:35.470]  His track record of being good is too short, but here's what I do know,
[00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.470]  and this is why I answer the question I get asked so much on the street.
[00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:44.470]  This is the reason, this whole discussion of the last seven, eight minutes is so important.
[00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:50.470]  It doesn't really matter, does it? Listen to me carefully.
[00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:55.470]  The fact that every major super hot talk show host,
[00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.470]  I mean, hot is in a lot of listeners.
[00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:01.470]  Even Megyn Kelly, not super hot in either way,
[00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.470]  but she's back now, Mrs. Patriot, Mrs. Antony Lawler.
[00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:08.470]  She's had to come towards Alex Jones, not me towards her.
[00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:14.470]  And if you look at Alex Jones on one end and George Soros on the other,
[00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.470]  these are the polar opposites. Joe Rogan's right over here right next to me.
[00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.470]  Tucker Carlson's right up next to me, maybe even past me.
[00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:23.470]  Elon Musk in rhetoric is way over here.
[00:39:23.470 --> 00:39:26.470]  Megyn Kelly's way over here.
[00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:29.470]  All the other talk show hosts are way over where I'm at.
[00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.470]  They're all being drawn into what I cover.
[00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:35.470]  And it's not like I'm writing this up like Stephen King and they follow some script.
[00:39:35.470 --> 00:39:37.470]  No, they now see my perspective. They now know it's true.
[00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:39.470]  And they know it's popular.
[00:39:39.470 --> 00:39:43.470]  And they know that they get 99% support when they say these things.
[00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:47.470]  So whether they're good or not, they're on the bandwagon, baby.
[00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:50.470]  And I want to tump the New World Order boat over
[00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:52.470]  because it's the boat that's taking us to hell.
[00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.470]  And I want us to jump off the boat into the Sea of Tranquility
[00:39:55.470 --> 00:39:58.470]  and the Holy Spirit and swim back to shore.
[00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.470]  So picture we're on this slave ship about to go into the mouth of hell.
[00:40:01.470 --> 00:40:03.470]  You ever see people on a big barge or a big boat
[00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:06.470]  when everybody runs over to one side of the boat and it turns over?
[00:40:06.470 --> 00:40:08.470]  Folks, we've already run over to the other side of the boat.
[00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:10.470]  The boat's already tumped over upside down.
[00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.470]  And we can try to climb back on top and get back on the cap-sized boat.
[00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:19.470]  And guys, pull up an image of crowd makes boat cap-sized.
[00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:21.470]  There's lots of famous footage of it.
[00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:23.470]  And we can't find it quickly. Just add it and post.
[00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.470]  We post the Bandai video.
[00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:29.470]  And so usually you think of a boat cap-sized and it's not good, but this is good.
[00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:33.470]  We are all rushing to one side to tump this whole agenda over.
[00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:35.470]  And it's basically already happened.
[00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:38.470]  And the globalists know their agenda is tumped over so they don't know what to do.
[00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:42.470]  So it doesn't matter if Joe Rogan's for real or Alex Jones is for real
[00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.470]  or any of these people are because you know you're for real.
[00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:47.470]  You're inside your mind, your soul, your spirit.
[00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:49.470]  I want freedom. I don't like the New World Order.
[00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.470]  I want to be prosperous. I want to be free. I want to be secure.
[00:40:51.470 --> 00:40:53.470]  I don't want the New World Order as you know, 2030.
[00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:55.470]  I don't want my resources cut off. I don't want pedophilia.
[00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.470]  I don't want fentanyl. I don't want devalued currency.
[00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:58.470]  I don't want World War III.
[00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.470]  I just want to live and be peaceful and happy
[00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:03.470]  and go to church and take care of my kids and take care of my grandma.
[00:41:03.470 --> 00:41:06.470]  I just want to have a garden in the backyard and watch sunsets.
[00:41:06.470 --> 00:41:08.470]  And I'm just saying, you know, you're somebody after God's own heart.
[00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:09.470]  You're just a good, decent person.
[00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.470]  Well, you know you're good.
[00:41:11.470 --> 00:41:14.470]  And whether these people are good or bad, it doesn't matter.
[00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:17.470]  They're now having to sound just like you
[00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:20.470]  and they're singing to our sheet of music.
[00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:24.470]  So there's this orchestra with Joe Rogan and Elon Musk
[00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:31.470]  and Tucker Carlson and Tulsi Gabbers and Orban and Bolsonaro
[00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:35.470]  and the list goes on and on and on and on and on
[00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:37.470]  and Japanese leaders and African leaders.
[00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:41.470]  I mean, Nigel Farage, British leaders, German leaders everywhere.
[00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:45.470]  And who's up there?
[00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:48.470]  The globalists see it as I'm conducting.
[00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:49.470]  I'm actually not conducting.
[00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.470]  They now see the truth, so they're all playing the same sheet of music.
[00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:56.470]  But the globalists see it as Alex Jones, patient zero, the conductor.
[00:41:56.470 --> 00:41:59.470]  Ray Epps sent a text message to his family.
[00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:02.470]  Hey, I just orchestrated the attack on the Capitol.
[00:42:02.470 --> 00:42:05.470]  Well, I orchestrated the attack on the new order with your help.
[00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:07.470]  We all did this together.
[00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:10.470]  And so you need to know that now and understand that now.
[00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.470]  And that's why this broadcast is so hated because we're on target.
[00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:18.470]  Nine times out of 10, we break the big key news first.
[00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:21.470]  And we just need to know and celebrate because of the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:25.470]  what God gave us, the position we're in and be thankful, not prideful,
[00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:29.470]  but satisfied and appreciative and thankful to God.
[00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.470]  A real feeling of accomplishment to the crew as well.
[00:42:33.470 --> 00:42:34.470]  Just I love you to death.
[00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.470]  And then the whole audience is activists.
[00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:37.470]  I love you so much.
[00:42:37.470 --> 00:42:38.470]  Black, white, old, young, all of you.
[00:42:38.470 --> 00:42:39.470]  You're so beautiful.
[00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.470]  And we're going to win this together.
[00:42:41.470 --> 00:42:44.470]  God's told me God wants us to be thankful
[00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:47.470]  and have a little bit of a victory lap, a little bit of satisfaction.
[00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:50.470]  I mean, we have torn the hell out of the new world war.
[00:42:50.470 --> 00:42:53.470]  I mean, we have beat the living daylights out of the enemy.
[00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.470]  We'll be right back.
[00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.470]  Stay with us.
[00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.470]  With all the craziness in the world, the collapsing borders,
[00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.470]  the war with Russia, the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.470]  the economy going crazy.
[00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:11.470]  You are crazy, in my view, if you don't get high quality,
[00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:14.470]  storeable food and water filtration and self-defense.
[00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:16.470]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:17.470]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:19.470]  and learn how to use if you haven't.
[00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:20.470]  And I'm preaching to the choir on that.
[00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:22.470]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:25.470]  but they don't have enough storeable food or water filtration.
[00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:27.470]  This is something you need now.
[00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:29.470]  And we've got it in the food department
[00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:31.470]  and in the high quality water filtration department.
[00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:34.470]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration

[00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:22.470]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better

[00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:25.470]  Krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:26.470]  And I'm sorry.
[00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:28.470]  You want something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.470]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:31.470]  It's so good in my view.
[00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:33.470]  I'm not making a medical statement here but let me tell you something.
[00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.470]  I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.470]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:44.470]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:49.470]  So we don't make a big profit off of it.
[00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:53.470]  I just obsess because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:54.470]  I just can't do it.
[00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:56.470]  infowarstore.com.
[00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:06.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:23.890]  We are back live, spending Sunday night together, very honored and blessed you decided to join
[00:47:23.890 --> 00:47:24.890]  us.
[00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:31.370]  Now please take the live show feed, share it with your email list, your text messages.
[00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:34.770]  Tell everybody you know, tune in to hear the verboten truth.
[00:47:34.770 --> 00:47:41.729]  You know, you got a firearm in your house because someday, sometime, maybe tonight, maybe next
[00:47:41.729 --> 00:47:45.770]  year, maybe never, if you're blessed, somebody's gonna try to break in your house with home
[00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:46.770]  invasion.
[00:47:46.770 --> 00:47:50.410]  And you're gonna need to be able to have that firearm to let them know, don't come
[00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:55.689]  in here, I'm gonna kill you, or I'm gonna shoot you, or if they do break in, you can
[00:47:55.689 --> 00:47:57.729]  protect your family.
[00:47:57.729 --> 00:48:06.169]  Well, the chances of you having a home invasion, in my view, are much lower than another bioweapon
[00:48:06.169 --> 00:48:09.850]  getting released on purpose or by accident from one of these labs that are being run
[00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:13.069]  by the New World Order.
[00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:18.970]  And so I've made it a point in my 29 years on air to study something called race-specific
[00:48:18.970 --> 00:48:19.970]  bioweapons.
[00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:26.049]  So the Vice President of the United States wrote a paper in September of 2000.
[00:48:26.049 --> 00:48:30.009]  Here it is on screen for you, anybody can type this in and find it.
[00:48:30.009 --> 00:48:36.529]  It's a project for New American Century, a neocon, CFR, Bilderberg Group think tank,
[00:48:36.529 --> 00:48:41.970]  rebuilding America's defense's strategy, forces, and resources for a new century.
[00:48:41.970 --> 00:48:47.890]  Now in this, they set a terror attack that kills on league with the level of deaths
[00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:55.209]  in Pearl Harbor, which was 3,000, 9-11 was 3,000, one year later, would be ideal
[00:48:55.370 --> 00:48:59.209]  to launch Pax Americana.
[00:48:59.209 --> 00:49:05.009]  They also, it's a long report, but we just printed one page for you, this is page 60.
[00:49:05.009 --> 00:49:10.529]  And it says, an advanced form of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes
[00:49:10.529 --> 00:49:19.609]  may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.
[00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:23.049]  And it goes on to say that this is what we may need to use against foreign enemies
[00:49:23.089 --> 00:49:27.049]  because they're getting so sophisticated.
[00:49:27.049 --> 00:49:32.890]  So I just showed you Dick Cheney, you may have heard of him.
[00:49:32.890 --> 00:49:36.169]  See when the news calls me on white supremacy, notice they don't show a clip of anything
[00:49:36.169 --> 00:49:38.089]  like that because they're lying.
[00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:42.490]  When I tell you Dick Cheney said that 20 minutes ago, I went, you know what, better
[00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.930]  print it, better show it.
[00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:46.930]  That's the hallmark of real news versus lies.
[00:49:46.930 --> 00:49:51.689]  You've heard on the news that I sent people to pee on children's dead children's graves.
[00:49:51.689 --> 00:49:52.930]  Never did it, no one ever did it.
[00:49:53.810 --> 00:49:54.810]  It's not true.
[00:49:54.810 --> 00:49:55.810]  Does it matter?
[00:49:55.810 --> 00:49:56.810]  That's what the media says.
[00:49:56.810 --> 00:49:59.810]  All right, continuing.
[00:49:59.810 --> 00:50:03.810]  Here's Kamala Harris on Friday talking about depopulation.
[00:50:03.810 --> 00:50:06.810]  They go, oh, well she misspoke, of course she can't talk.
[00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:08.810]  The point is her Freudian slip is true.
[00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:10.810]  The whole agenda is depopulation.
[00:50:10.810 --> 00:50:16.810]  I'll read some quotes to you in a few minutes after we play the RFA club, but here she is.
[00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:21.810]  When we invest in clean energy and electric vehicles and reduce population,
[00:50:22.689 --> 00:50:27.689]  more of our children can breathe clean air and drink clean water.
[00:50:27.689 --> 00:50:29.689]  Okay.
[00:50:29.689 --> 00:50:33.689]  So we're going to have clean air and drink clean water if we kill people.
[00:50:33.689 --> 00:50:38.089]  And I'm going to show you the UN saying we've got to get rid of 300 plus thousand
[00:50:38.089 --> 00:50:41.689]  people a day to save the earth.
[00:50:41.689 --> 00:50:45.689]  I'm going to show you the quotes from the UN.
[00:50:45.689 --> 00:50:48.689]  Now, let's move to RFK Jr.
[00:50:49.569 --> 00:50:54.569]  He's had a big gala event, gives a speech and says, you know,
[00:50:54.569 --> 00:50:58.569]  no COVID's made in a lab and goes over some of the evidence of that.
[00:50:58.569 --> 00:51:02.569]  And then he continues, well, let's just see the clip, says, yeah,
[00:51:02.569 --> 00:51:05.569]  the studies show that it needs to be more research on this,
[00:51:05.569 --> 00:51:10.569]  but that it specifically targets Anglos and Africans more.
[00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:16.569]  And notice I was politically correct right there, and I'm going to stop doing it because
[00:51:17.450 --> 00:51:22.450]  It's like they say, calling a homosexual a homosexual is an insult.
[00:51:22.450 --> 00:51:26.450]  It's heterosexual, homosexual. It's cockazoid or Anglo.
[00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:31.450]  I mean, it just means like in Spanish, Negro just means black folks.
[00:51:31.450 --> 00:51:34.450]  It has nothing to do with being mean to black people.
[00:51:34.450 --> 00:51:38.450]  The point is there, see, people don't care about killing blacks with bio weapons.
[00:51:38.450 --> 00:51:41.450]  It's just don't call them the N word.
[00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:44.450]  I mean, and now they're moving to say that all those words are bad.
[00:51:45.330 --> 00:51:48.330]  This shows how, oh, we've taken all your rides for cutting your kids' genitals off,
[00:51:48.330 --> 00:51:51.330]  but don't use the scientific name for black people.
[00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.330]  It's preposterous.
[00:51:54.330 --> 00:52:01.330]  Meanwhile, that's what the studies say is that it targets Negroes and cockazoids.
[00:52:01.330 --> 00:52:05.330]  And that kind of sounds like a weird name too for white people, but that's the name.
[00:52:05.330 --> 00:52:09.330]  You don't like it? Maybe we should change the scientific name if scientific names are
[00:52:09.330 --> 00:52:13.330]  scary sounding. I think cockazoid sounds like something's wrong with you.
[00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:17.210]  Ooh, I'm a cockazoid, but it means you come from the caucus mountains.
[00:52:17.210 --> 00:52:20.210]  That's where they find the earliest skeletons of white people.
[00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:24.210]  But regardless, ladies and gentlemen, notice how we're caught up in political correctness.
[00:52:24.210 --> 00:52:28.210]  We can't even talk about the science because we're too busy.
[00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:33.210]  Oh, all the science words are scary, so let's not know the science words.
[00:52:33.210 --> 00:52:38.210]  So continuing here, there's a plot to create weapons to kill certain races of people,
[00:52:38.210 --> 00:52:43.210]  but we better not tell you the different names of the races in the science books.
[00:52:44.089 --> 00:52:46.089]  A recipe for idiocracy.
[00:52:46.089 --> 00:52:49.089]  So I just showed you Dick Cheney calling for the development of that.
[00:52:49.089 --> 00:52:51.089]  I just showed you Kamala Harris.
[00:52:51.089 --> 00:52:54.089]  I'll show you a bunch of quotes, but here's RFK.
[00:52:54.089 --> 00:53:03.089]  And now he's being called an anti-Semite because he's covering the studies I'll show you.
[00:53:03.089 --> 00:53:09.089]  There's a bunch of them saying the receptor points on the way this virus was designed
[00:53:09.089 --> 00:53:12.089]  particularly attacked black and white people.
[00:53:12.970 --> 00:53:18.970]  And that Ashkenazi Jews, not all Jews, Russian Jews who are part Asian,
[00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:21.970]  also have a low infection rate.
[00:53:21.970 --> 00:53:26.970]  RFK Jr. under fire for saying COVID-19 may have been an ethnic bio weapon
[00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:28.970]  created to target white and black people.
[00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:32.970]  You know, they have thousands of studies that corn syrup is bad for everybody.
[00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:37.970]  But if a Asian eats corn syrup or a Hispanic who's part Asian,
[00:53:38.850 --> 00:53:39.850]  it is devastating.
[00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.850]  You see all the Asian people on the street corners, the bus stops with their legs cut off,
[00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:44.850]  even young people.
[00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:51.850]  No one's telling them, hey, you really can't drink corn syrup as a Hispanic who is part Asian.
[00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:52.850]  That's what Hispanics are.
[00:53:52.850 --> 00:54:01.850]  They're a mix of Spanish and Portuguese with the native population that was Asian.
[00:54:01.850 --> 00:54:07.850]  Native Americans, people like Geronimo, you test his blood, 100% Chinese.
[00:54:08.729 --> 00:54:09.729]  That's where he came from.
[00:54:09.729 --> 00:54:11.729]  His ancestors thousands of years before.
[00:54:11.729 --> 00:54:13.729]  Anyways, continuing.
[00:54:13.729 --> 00:54:15.729]  Pull up Geronimo for folks.
[00:54:15.729 --> 00:54:18.729]  And the issue is, oh, it's made in China funny.
[00:54:18.729 --> 00:54:23.729]  It isn't as deadly on Asians or incidentally Ashkenazi Jews.
[00:54:23.729 --> 00:54:25.729]  He's not saying it's a conspiracy.
[00:54:25.729 --> 00:54:27.729]  That's what the studies show.
[00:54:27.729 --> 00:54:29.729]  That's what's going on.
[00:54:29.729 --> 00:54:35.729]  And here's some of the articles that show that bio weapons designed to kill only people
[00:54:36.609 --> 00:54:37.609]  in particular race.
[00:54:37.609 --> 00:54:38.609]  The Guardian.
[00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:43.609]  COVID-19 pandemic origins, bio weapons, the history of laboratory leaks.
[00:54:43.609 --> 00:54:47.609]  A big scientific paper report getting into race specific weapons.
[00:54:47.609 --> 00:54:49.609]  COVID SARS, COVID-2, COVID.
[00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:53.609]  Be a biological weapon and be race specific.
[00:54:53.609 --> 00:54:55.609]  It's all fair biological warfare.
[00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:58.609]  The controversy of genetically engineered bio weapons and it goes on.
[00:54:58.609 --> 00:55:01.609]  Pentagon making race specific bio weapons to target civilians.
[00:55:01.609 --> 00:55:02.609]  China says.
[00:55:02.609 --> 00:55:04.609]  So the point is, this is going on.
[00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:09.490]  All these out saying the receptors on this, the virus looks like it's designed.
[00:55:09.490 --> 00:55:13.490]  And we know black people died twice as much as any other group.
[00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:24.490]  A lot of that was vitamin D deficiency, but the rest of it was the issue of the race specific nature.
[00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:30.490]  So again, they think pulling this crap, Colin Trump anti-Semitic or RFK Jr anti-Semitic,
[00:55:30.490 --> 00:55:33.490]  it doesn't work because it's not true and it's stupid.
[00:55:34.370 --> 00:55:35.370]  And we should talk about the origin of the virus.
[00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:36.370]  We should talk about who it attacks.
[00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:38.370]  We should be honest about that.
[00:55:38.370 --> 00:55:39.370]  Here's the clip.
[00:55:41.370 --> 00:55:43.370]  And we need to talk about bio weapons.
[00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:48.370]  I know a lot now about bio weapons because I've been doing a book on it for the past
[00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:50.370]  two and a half years.
[00:55:50.370 --> 00:55:57.370]  And you know, the technology that we now have to develop these,
[00:55:58.250 --> 00:56:04.250]  we put hundreds of millions of dollars into ethnically targeted microbes.
[00:56:04.250 --> 00:56:07.250]  The Chinese have done the same thing.
[00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:13.250]  In fact, COVID-19, there's an argument that it is ethnically targeted.
[00:56:13.250 --> 00:56:19.250]  COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately.
[00:56:20.129 --> 00:56:29.129]  The races that are most immune to COVID-19 are because of the structure,
[00:56:29.129 --> 00:56:39.129]  the genetic structure, the genetic differentials among different races of the receptors,
[00:56:39.129 --> 00:56:42.129]  of the ACE2 receptor.
[00:56:43.009 --> 00:56:51.009]  COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and black people.
[00:56:51.009 --> 00:56:57.009]  The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.
[00:56:57.009 --> 00:57:01.009]  We don't know whether it was deliberately targeted or not,
[00:57:01.009 --> 00:57:07.009]  but there are papers out there that show the racial and ethnic differential
[00:57:07.009 --> 00:57:09.009]  and the impact to that.
[00:57:09.890 --> 00:57:14.890]  We do know that the Chinese are spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing bio weapons
[00:57:14.890 --> 00:57:16.890]  and we are developing ethnic bio weapons.
[00:57:16.890 --> 00:57:20.890]  That's where all those labs in the Ukraine are about.
[00:57:20.890 --> 00:57:22.890]  They're collecting Russian DNA.
[00:57:22.890 --> 00:57:27.890]  They're collecting Chinese DNA that we can target people by race.
[00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:29.890]  And by the way, they're attacking him for saying that,
[00:57:29.890 --> 00:57:34.890]  but now they admit, Victoria Nuland, the US ambassador to NATO and to the EU,
[00:57:34.890 --> 00:57:38.890]  admits that those are bio weapon labs the US built under Obama in Ukraine.
[00:57:39.769 --> 00:57:42.769]  Our number two straight ahead. Please support us at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:42.769 --> 00:57:46.769]  Patriot Pride Month is live. Huge discounts. Infowarsstore.com. Please go there.
[00:57:49.769 --> 00:57:52.769]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[00:57:52.769 --> 00:57:56.769]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[00:57:56.769 --> 00:58:01.769]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element,
[00:58:01.769 --> 00:58:05.769]  which has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:58:05.769 --> 00:58:08.769]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:58:09.649 --> 00:58:12.649]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:58:12.649 --> 00:58:16.649]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics
[00:58:16.649 --> 00:58:20.649]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[00:58:20.649 --> 00:58:25.649]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[00:58:25.649 --> 00:58:30.649]  derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[00:58:30.649 --> 00:58:36.649]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:58:37.529 --> 00:58:42.529]  Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[00:58:42.529 --> 00:58:45.529]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,
[00:58:45.529 --> 00:58:49.529]  get yours now at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:58:50.529 --> 00:58:53.529]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:55.529]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:58:55.529 --> 00:58:59.529]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:58:59.529 --> 00:59:01.529]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[00:59:01.529 --> 00:59:04.529]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the riders,
[00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:08.410]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:59:08.410 --> 00:59:10.410]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer
[00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:13.410]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:15.410]  five, six, seven days a week,
[00:59:15.410 --> 00:59:17.410]  it's really just incredible.
[00:59:17.410 --> 00:59:19.410]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[00:59:19.410 --> 00:59:21.410]  I thank you for your past support.
[00:59:21.410 --> 00:59:23.410]  I only encourage you now to realize that
[00:59:23.410 --> 00:59:26.410]  Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:59:26.410 --> 00:59:28.410]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:30.410]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:32.410]  But most viewers and listeners,
[00:59:32.410 --> 00:59:34.410]  never go to Infowarsstore.com
[00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:37.290]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.290]  while at the same time keep us on air.
[00:59:39.290 --> 00:59:41.290]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[00:59:41.290 --> 00:59:43.290]  actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:59:43.290 --> 00:59:45.290]  If just 1% more of you took action
[00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:47.290]  and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[00:59:47.290 --> 00:59:49.290]  our funding problems will be over.
[00:59:49.290 --> 00:59:51.290]  Please take action now.
[00:59:51.290 --> 00:59:53.290]  Leading a frontal assault
[00:59:53.290 --> 00:59:55.290]  on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:57.290]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.730 --> 01:00:08.730]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star!
[01:00:11.730 --> 01:00:14.730]  When I grow up, I want to overthrow the New World Order.
[01:00:20.730 --> 01:00:23.730]  Oh Jesus, thanks for giving me my one prayer.
[01:00:24.730 --> 01:00:26.730]  And I'm willing to pay the price.
[01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:28.730]  I'll put the cards on the table.
[01:00:29.730 --> 01:00:34.730]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:00:35.730 --> 01:00:37.730]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:42.730]  Alright, let me do this.
[01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:44.730]  I am not plugged.
[01:00:45.730 --> 01:00:48.730]  And when I don't plug, we go bankrupt and shut down.
[01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:51.730]  And we have a patent to stay on air thanks to your support and I want to thank you all.
[01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:53.730]  But let me do this right now.
[01:00:53.730 --> 01:01:00.730]  We've got a huge hour of news and information coming up here for you in just a moment.
[01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:05.730]  Race-specific bio-weapons, Kamala Harris admitting the plan is to cut off your energy and depopulate you.
[01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.730]  I mean the world's really waking up right now.
[01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:13.730]  But we have a lot more important work to do here in the near future.
[01:01:14.730 --> 01:01:17.730]  And we don't want to just point out what we were right about and what's currently happening.
[01:01:18.730 --> 01:01:19.730]  We need to talk about what's coming over the horizon.
[01:01:20.730 --> 01:01:27.730]  Because so many people that are now awake to the agenda and fighting it still don't have over the horizon understanding of the next phase of the enemy operation.
[01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:30.730]  And that's because it is really horrible.
[01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:40.730]  But if you don't admit how horrible it is and go ahead and say how horrible it is, which at first you get attacked for because it's not in polite culture to tell people,
[01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:44.730]  hey, billions of people have been injected with a sterilant that will also give most of us cancer.
[01:01:44.730 --> 01:01:50.730]  There are ways to try to mitigate it and clean it out, but again, if you don't tell people, there's no way they can then be protected.
[01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:56.730]  So to say this broadcast is life and death is really an understatement.
[01:01:57.730 --> 01:02:03.730]  And I want to thank and really from the bottom of my heart salute all the viewers and listeners that have prayed for us and shared the articles and videos
[01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:11.730]  and also kept us on air financially by going to info.warstore.com and getting amazing products that also enrich your life.
[01:02:11.730 --> 01:02:19.730]  I just wanted to encourage those that have been on the fence for whatever reason, the vast majority of viewers and listeners, to at least pray for the broadcast and share the articles and videos.
[01:02:20.730 --> 01:02:26.730]  And I thank you for that. But I would really encourage you to go to info.warstore.com and get an Alex Jones for President shirt.
[01:02:27.730 --> 01:02:32.730]  It's a great novelty, great discussion point. It's a one-time print. It's almost about to be sold out.
[01:02:32.730 --> 01:02:40.730]  There's only still a few hundred left of the signed Great Reset War for the World, Alex Jones book. Those will be gone very, very soon.
[01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:46.730]  We have basically unlimited of the unsigned. It's a great book. Plans the Death Star, info.warstore.com.
[01:02:47.730 --> 01:02:51.730]  We have the Trump political prisoner shirt. You know, we never got that mugshot yet, so we made our own.
[01:02:52.730 --> 01:02:54.730]  It's a great shirt, about to sell out. It'll be gone.
[01:02:55.730 --> 01:03:00.730]  And we have Patriot Pride Month going right now through the end of July, and that's double patriot points,
[01:03:00.730 --> 01:03:11.730]  up to 60% off of best-selling products like super female vitality and, of course, nitric boost that cleans out your blood and the fish oil and the krill oil are the highest grades out there.
[01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:18.730]  And just for the dreams you have when you take the high-grade fish oil and krill oil, it's worth what it does cardiovascularly.
[01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:21.730]  And the rest of your joints and your body is really spectacular.
[01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:27.730]  And then speaking of joints and also your overall immune system, Ultimate Bone Broth is close to selling out.
[01:03:27.730 --> 01:03:39.730]  It had been sold out for over two years. Finally got enough money and funds and supply chain was back, so we got it even updated and better with Chaga Mushroom and the beef ballin' and the turmeric and the concentrated chicken bone broth, organic.
[01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:47.730]  It's amazing. It's 40% off. It's all at info.warstore.com, and the sale will run to the end of the month.
[01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:53.730]  Now, a lot of the items you see will soon not be available because they're going to sell out.
[01:03:53.730 --> 01:03:58.730]  So we extended the July 4th sale is what this is, and it's a great deal. Double Patriot points.
[01:03:59.730 --> 01:04:10.730]  But a lot of these will soon be off the list, like Ultimate Bone Broth, Ultimate Krill Oil, Ultimate Fish Oil, Organic Green Fibers, Immune Support, Probiotic Fiber, Brainforce Ultra, Brainforce Plus, 50% off.
[01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:17.730]  That's about to sell out. Turbo Force, that's going to be—it's going to full price in a couple days. It's about to sell out.
[01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:24.730]  Survival Shield X3, days till it sells out. Vitamin D3, gummy, 25% off. Whole food multivitamins, it goes down the list.
[01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:33.730]  And this is a big discount. 10% off on all water filtration, air filtration, and storeable food. There's not even—there's like 30% markup in that.
[01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:37.730]  So that's what we're living off of on that. It's the best products out there for the price you're paying.
[01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:41.730]  You can pay three times more and get something better, but for quality, it's the lowest price out there.
[01:04:41.730 --> 01:04:47.730]  Where I choose to get my water filtration, air filtration, food, ready to ship right now, Infowarsdoor.com, 10% off.
[01:04:48.730 --> 01:04:51.730]  But that's got to end in days, I'm told, because they're about to sell out of the water filters.
[01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:57.730]  And it was about six months since we had those. So if you want them, get them now, Infowarsdoor.com. Take action. Thanks for the support.
[01:04:58.730 --> 01:05:03.730]  I want to thank all of you over the years who have supported Infowars financially and with word of mouth and prayer.
[01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:10.730]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major takeover
[01:05:11.730 --> 01:05:14.730]  is because of you. Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:21.730]  I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowarsdoor.com, like books and films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.

[01:06:05.730 --> 01:06:29.730]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:29.730 --> 01:06:43.730]  We are back live. Tower number two. I am your host, Alex Jones. Owen Schroeder takes over in 60 minutes. The Sunday live always does an out of the park job.
[01:06:44.730 --> 01:06:55.730]  Okay, so I just spent the last segment getting into Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at an event giving a talk and saying there's a lot of evidence these are race-specific bio weapons that was made in the lab.
[01:06:56.730 --> 01:07:01.730]  Well, that's not even debated now. It's been scanned three and a half years ago by the Indians and everybody else.
[01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:08.730]  And the discoverer of HIV scanned it in France three years ago and said it was man-made. I mean, we know that.
[01:07:09.730 --> 01:07:13.730]  And we know they already had it pre-made, the so-called vaccine, where they released the virus.
[01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:23.730]  So Peter Daszak, Bill Gates, Minnie Mee, Dr. Evil over there, Fauci, they've got their fingerprints all over it. It's just mind-blowing.
[01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:29.730]  It's all come out in Congress now. And so, boy, are they coming out of the woodwork in the corporate media.
[01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:34.730]  Oh, R.F.K. Jr., anti-Semitic. I mean, he says it's just the Jews are protected.
[01:07:35.730 --> 01:07:41.730]  Well, they're not protected in Israel from the government trying to make them take those poison shots other than Singapore and a few places.
[01:07:42.730 --> 01:07:46.730]  It was the most draconian lockdowns and forced injections in the world in Israel.
[01:07:46.730 --> 01:07:55.730]  So if the Jews aren't getting a free ride from people that say, you know, it's a Jewish conspiracy.
[01:07:56.730 --> 01:08:02.730]  But see, he just points out what the study says, and then he's anti-Semite for just showing what the study says.
[01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:08.730]  But we could have a war game here and ask, why did the shy comms of the CIA, we know they were all involved with that lab.
[01:08:09.730 --> 01:08:12.730]  There's one of the studies right there. Print that for me, please.
[01:08:13.730 --> 01:08:22.730]  Why would they make a race-specific virus that doesn't hit Chinese as bad, and then why would it not hit Ashkenazi Jews as bad?
[01:08:23.730 --> 01:08:29.730]  For whatever reason, it looks like Jews are like a mix of some ancient Asian bloodline.
[01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:37.730]  That's what Arabs are. With Caucasians, that's what the genetics are.
[01:08:38.730 --> 01:08:47.730]  When they do genetic tests of a, quote, Arab, they are part African, and they are part Anglo, and they are part Asian.
[01:08:48.730 --> 01:08:51.730]  Now, that's what that is, is a hybrid mixture. It's an Arab, it's three different groups.
[01:08:52.730 --> 01:08:59.730]  And you've got the Sephardic Jews that are part Arab or Middle Eastern, you know, the dark Jews you see.
[01:09:00.730 --> 01:09:04.730]  You watch Israeli TV and you can see, like, okay, well, there's an Ashkenazi Jew, they look like Albert Einstein.
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:13.730]  And then there's a handsome, dark-skinned, six-foot-five dude who's a Sephardic Jew.
[01:09:14.730 --> 01:09:20.730]  And those are just genetic differences, ladies and gentlemen. Larry David is an Ashkenazi Jew.
[01:09:21.730 --> 01:09:30.730]  People that have names like Russo was a Sephardic Jew.
[01:09:31.730 --> 01:09:38.730]  He actually was a Middle Eastern Jew, his bloodline going, he was a family out of Spain, actually going back to the real Jews.
[01:09:39.730 --> 01:09:42.730]  And I'm not saying there wasn't real Jews connected to the Russian Jews.
[01:09:43.730 --> 01:09:48.730]  It's just that the Sephardic Jews are the ones, when you test the DNA, they're like, Jesus was a Sephardic Jew, okay?
[01:09:49.730 --> 01:09:51.730]  But it's all really, really interesting stuff.
[01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:55.730]  And a Sephardic Jew gets hit just as bad as anybody else by the COVID.
[01:09:55.730 --> 01:10:06.730]  But in these major studies, for some reason, Chinese, not just even the other Asians, they get a little less, but Chinese were some of the most, homogeneous is the word.
[01:10:07.730 --> 01:10:08.730]  Other people call it inbred.
[01:10:09.730 --> 01:10:17.730]  You know, like, people are homogeneous in, the white people in West Virginia coal towns and stuff, you know, as they're marrying their sister.
[01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:19.730]  And I'm saying, I mean, that's just a fact.
[01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:22.730]  And it causes genetic problems, schizophrenia, mental illness, you name it.
[01:10:22.730 --> 01:10:25.730]  So royalty is interbred. That's why they're so crazy.
[01:10:26.730 --> 01:10:29.730]  Now, the Egyptian royalty was completely insane because they would interbreed.
[01:10:30.730 --> 01:10:35.730]  And you see the Rothschilds giving speeches about, yes, I've been interbreeding with our family for 400 years.
[01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:37.730]  But you're not supposed to do that now.
[01:10:38.730 --> 01:10:39.730]  Yeah, because it creates lunatics.
[01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:46.730]  And so much of the lunatic behavior we see in the world is from inbred groups.
[01:10:47.730 --> 01:10:50.730]  But I digress from that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:10:50.730 --> 01:10:51.730]  We love everybody.
[01:10:52.730 --> 01:10:59.730]  And one thing of inbreeding, really smart people particularly, is you get some super geniuses, but you also get some super lunatics.
[01:11:00.730 --> 01:11:01.730]  So you do get some uber mention out of this.
[01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:13.730]  The British did a secret breeding program with the Huxleys, the Wedgwoods, the Darwins, and like seven other families, starting in about 1800, and just three generations of it.
[01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:20.730]  By three generations of inbreeding, they had something like half the kids were total mental patient lunatics.
[01:11:21.730 --> 01:11:22.730]  And they stopped at that point.
[01:11:23.730 --> 01:11:26.730]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, I am digressing.
[01:11:27.730 --> 01:11:33.730]  This is all genetic engineering, and I'm just giving you kind of the novice pop survey or analysis of it.
[01:11:34.730 --> 01:11:35.730]  It's incredibly intriguing.
[01:11:36.730 --> 01:11:37.730]  And the globalists are obsessed with it.
[01:11:37.730 --> 01:11:43.730]  And at Cold Springs Harbor, shut up the most powerful eugenics, proto-Nazi.
[01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:45.730]  That means pre-Nazi.
[01:11:46.730 --> 01:11:48.730]  Proto is pre, neo is after.
[01:11:49.730 --> 01:11:51.730]  So modern skinheads are neo-Nazis.
[01:11:52.730 --> 01:11:54.730]  Proto-Nazis are pre-Nazi.
[01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:56.730]  And the white supremacists get real mad.
[01:11:57.730 --> 01:11:58.730]  I'll go, yes, the globalists are the super-Nazis.
[01:11:59.730 --> 01:12:00.730]  They are the proto-Nazis.
[01:12:01.730 --> 01:12:02.730]  They are the mothers of the Nazis.
[01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:04.730]  They go, how dare you, idiot!
[01:12:04.730 --> 01:12:08.730]  It's the National Workers' Socialist Party, and didn't get founded until after World War I,
[01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:13.730]  and Hitler wasn't the head of it until the early, late 1920s.
[01:12:14.730 --> 01:12:15.730]  And what an idiot!
[01:12:16.730 --> 01:12:17.730]  Doesn't even know where Nazis come from.
[01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:19.730]  No, you don't know.
[01:12:20.730 --> 01:12:21.730]  You're ignorant.
[01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:23.730]  You think you're smart.
[01:12:24.730 --> 01:12:25.730]  You don't know anything.
[01:12:26.730 --> 01:12:27.730]  Yeah, let's put the Habsburg jaw back up there.
[01:12:28.730 --> 01:12:29.730]  That's what the British and European elites basically all looked like after inbreeding for a few hundred years.
[01:12:30.730 --> 01:12:31.730]  And they were idiots.
[01:12:32.730 --> 01:12:33.730]  Absolute moron idiots.
[01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:37.730]  But occasionally they'd get one that was a super-genius.
[01:12:38.730 --> 01:12:40.730]  So that's the weird trick of the inbreeding is,
[01:12:41.730 --> 01:12:45.730]  you'll get 50 gibbering idiots where they've got to have whole facilities
[01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:50.730]  just to lock up all the deranged lunatic children,
[01:12:51.730 --> 01:12:53.730]  and they'll get one that can operate, usually.
[01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:55.730]  They're lucky they get a super-genius.
[01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:58.730]  So that's how this works.
[01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:01.730]  Sorry, I'm digressing off into history lessons here.
[01:13:01.730 --> 01:13:07.730]  So Robert F. Kennedy Jr. comes out and explains all this to everybody
[01:13:08.730 --> 01:13:09.730]  and lays this out.
[01:13:10.730 --> 01:13:12.730]  And they go completely ape.
[01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:17.730]  But I thought we would actually sit here and talk about reality.
[01:13:18.730 --> 01:13:23.730]  Remember just a year ago when Russia said we had to invade,
[01:13:24.730 --> 01:13:25.730]  they had bioweapon labs set up by Obama
[01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:29.730]  that were creating race-specific bioweapons to target Slavs,
[01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:31.730]  particularly Russian Slavs.
[01:13:32.730 --> 01:13:34.730]  And again, you're going to hit some other Slavs when you do this,
[01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:36.730]  but there's still certain types of the main,
[01:13:37.730 --> 01:13:39.730]  you know, they can isolate the main Russian gene,
[01:13:40.730 --> 01:13:41.730]  what the Russians have the most.
[01:13:42.730 --> 01:13:43.730]  And it's going to kill people in Poland.
[01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:45.730]  It's going to kill people in Ukraine.
[01:13:46.730 --> 01:13:47.730]  It's going to kill people in Serbia.
[01:13:48.730 --> 01:13:49.730]  It's going to kill Americans if it gets over here that have that gene.
[01:13:50.730 --> 01:13:54.730]  But they've got a thing that the Russians are not completely inbred,
[01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:56.730]  like, say, the Chinese.
[01:13:57.730 --> 01:13:58.730]  And I'm not bad at Chinese.
[01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:00.730]  Ask an Aussie Jew.
[01:14:01.730 --> 01:14:03.730]  And so you could say that's why they're immune
[01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:06.730]  is their genetics are so mutated.
[01:14:07.730 --> 01:14:08.730]  And I mean, being white is a mutation.
[01:14:09.730 --> 01:14:10.730]  Let's just get out of that.
[01:14:11.730 --> 01:14:12.730]  But a super mutation of the mutation,
[01:14:13.730 --> 01:14:14.730]  like red hair is a mutation of the mutation.
[01:14:15.730 --> 01:14:16.730]  And with the mutation has come advanced intelligence
[01:14:17.730 --> 01:14:18.730]  and some other things.
[01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:20.730]  But the point is, is that when I say
[01:14:21.730 --> 01:14:28.730]  that the Chinese are a inbred super mutant class,
[01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:30.730]  that's in the genetics.
[01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:33.730]  And again, remember, calls when a mutant's not a bad thing.
[01:14:34.730 --> 01:14:35.730]  You know, like the X-Men and all that,
[01:14:36.730 --> 01:14:37.730]  which is fictional, but, you know, it's like,
[01:14:38.730 --> 01:14:39.730]  oh, it's good to be a mutant, you understand?
[01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:41.730]  And the point is the Chinese do have
[01:14:42.730 --> 01:14:43.730]  some super geniuses in people.
[01:14:44.730 --> 01:14:45.730]  The point is, is you go to China and you're like,
[01:14:46.730 --> 01:14:47.730]  damn, you people almost look exactly the same,
[01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:49.730]  like clones or something, okay?
[01:14:50.730 --> 01:14:51.730]  So the issue is there's not a lot of genetic diversity.
[01:14:52.730 --> 01:14:53.730]  And so whoever cooked this up,
[01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:57.730]  it doesn't target Russian Jews, Ashkenazi Jews,
[01:14:57.730 --> 01:15:00.730]  and it doesn't target Chinese.
[01:15:01.730 --> 01:15:02.730]  You know, then why was China on fire and locked down?
[01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:05.730]  They used it to scare us and as a cover story,
[01:15:06.730 --> 01:15:07.730]  to round up the rest of their population
[01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:09.730]  and kill their people.
[01:15:10.730 --> 01:15:11.730]  The Chinese are great people, they've been enslaved,
[01:15:12.730 --> 01:15:13.730]  it's terrible.
[01:15:14.730 --> 01:15:15.730]  So that's where we are right now
[01:15:16.730 --> 01:15:17.730]  and we should be able to have
[01:15:18.730 --> 01:15:19.730]  a larger discussion about this.
[01:15:20.730 --> 01:15:23.730]  But just remember, a year ago,
[01:15:24.730 --> 01:15:26.730]  you could not say that there were any bio labs,
[01:15:27.730 --> 01:15:28.730]  it was a conspiracy theory,
[01:15:29.730 --> 01:15:30.730]  Snopes said it was fake.
[01:15:31.730 --> 01:15:32.730]  We're going to go to break.
[01:15:33.730 --> 01:15:34.730]  We come back, Victoria Nuland,
[01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:36.730]  the US ambassador to the EU,
[01:15:37.730 --> 01:15:38.730]  under oath said, yes, it's true.
[01:15:39.730 --> 01:15:40.730]  Well, we knew it was true.
[01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:42.730]  Obama bragged about it 10, 12 years ago,
[01:15:43.730 --> 01:15:44.730]  setting it all up.
[01:15:45.730 --> 01:15:46.730]  So that's another reason the Russians went in
[01:15:47.730 --> 01:15:48.730]  and I'm not an apologist for the Russians,
[01:15:49.730 --> 01:15:50.730]  I'm an apologist for the truth.
[01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:52.730]  I'm just telling you what's really going on
[01:15:53.730 --> 01:15:54.730]  in the US.
[01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:24.730]  Whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:26.730]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:29.730]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:31.730]  Absolutely.
[01:16:32.730 --> 01:16:36.730]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:16:37.730 --> 01:16:39.730]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[01:16:40.730 --> 01:16:41.730]  the real NPR of the base, right?
[01:16:42.730 --> 01:16:44.730]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:46.730]  Take out your phone, click that QR code.
[01:16:47.730 --> 01:16:48.730]  It'll take you directly to infowarstore.com.
[01:16:49.730 --> 01:16:50.730]  Buy something, support the Infowar,
[01:16:51.730 --> 01:16:52.730]  keep Alex Jones on Troyer,
[01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:55.730]  Greg Reese, Adam King, and the rest of us on air.
[01:16:56.730 --> 01:16:58.730]  Do it today, do it now, support the Infowar.
[01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:01.730]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil,
[01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:05.730]  which is at the foundation of our entire food supply.
[01:17:06.730 --> 01:17:08.730]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil
[01:17:09.730 --> 01:17:10.730]  of this essential trace element,
[01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:12.730]  which has caused an iodine deficiency
[01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:14.730]  in about half the population.
[01:17:15.730 --> 01:17:17.730]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:20.730]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[01:17:21.730 --> 01:17:22.730]  There are plenty of proven technologies
[01:17:23.730 --> 01:17:25.730]  in permaculture and biodynamics
[01:17:26.730 --> 01:17:29.730]  that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine.
[01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:31.730]  And we need to ensure that we get
[01:17:32.730 --> 01:17:34.730]  the sufficient amount of iodine every day,
[01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:36.730]  derived from ancient sea salts
[01:17:37.730 --> 01:17:39.730]  found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:43.730]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3
[01:17:44.730 --> 01:17:45.730]  is hands down the best.
[01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:47.730]  Pure nascent iodine,
[01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:51.730]  stabilized in an activated triiodine form.
[01:17:51.730 --> 01:17:54.730]  For a healthy thyroid and a healthy metabolism,
[01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:58.730]  get yours now at InfowarStore.com.
[01:17:59.730 --> 01:18:00.730]  With all the craziness in the world,
[01:18:01.730 --> 01:18:02.730]  the collapsing borders, the war with Russia,
[01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:05.730]  the insanity, the currency devaluations,
[01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:07.730]  the economy going crazy,
[01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.730]  you are crazy in my view
[01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:11.730]  if you don't get high-quality, swarable food
[01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:13.730]  and water filtration and self-defense.
[01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:15.730]  Now, we're not selling guns and ammo.
[01:18:16.730 --> 01:18:17.730]  That's for you to go out and get for yourself
[01:18:18.730 --> 01:18:19.730]  and learn how to use if you haven't.
[01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:21.730]  But a lot of people got plenty of guns,
[01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:23.730]  but they don't have enough swarable food
[01:18:24.730 --> 01:18:25.730]  or water filtration.
[01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:27.730]  This is something you need now,
[01:18:28.730 --> 01:18:29.730]  and we've got it in the food department
[01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:31.730]  and in the high-quality water filtration department.
[01:18:32.730 --> 01:18:33.730]  The highest quality food,
[01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:35.730]  the best water filtration at the lowest prices
[01:18:36.730 --> 01:18:37.730]  you're going to find and still get quality.
[01:18:38.730 --> 01:18:39.730]  InfowarStore.com is running a special right now
[01:18:40.730 --> 01:18:42.730]  for 10% off on all swarable food
[01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:44.730]  and on water and air filtration.
[01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:47.730]  Ladies and gentlemen, you cannot beat this deal.
[01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:48.730]  Our prices are already the lowest.
[01:18:49.730 --> 01:18:50.730]  At 10% off, it's an insane deal
[01:18:51.730 --> 01:18:52.730]  for a limited time.

[01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:56.730]  and get prepared while you still can.
[01:18:58.730 --> 01:18:59.730]  The globalists are only humans.
[01:19:00.730 --> 01:19:01.730]  Yeah, they have control of the central banks.
[01:19:02.730 --> 01:19:03.730]  They have a lot of power,
[01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:05.730]  but they can be defeated.
[01:19:06.730 --> 01:19:07.730]  But some of their operations
[01:19:08.730 --> 01:19:09.730]  are going to take decades to stop.
[01:19:10.730 --> 01:19:11.730]  But one thing you can do right now
[01:19:12.730 --> 01:19:13.730]  is take control of your body
[01:19:14.730 --> 01:19:15.730]  and your family's body
[01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:16.730]  that you cook with.
[01:19:17.730 --> 01:19:18.730]  And you do it with the highest quality
[01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:20.730]  gravity-fed filter out there.
[01:19:21.730 --> 01:19:22.730]  This thing does 10,000 gallons.
[01:19:23.730 --> 01:19:24.730]  You can sit there
[01:19:25.730 --> 01:19:26.730]  and put hundreds of gallons through it a day.
[01:19:27.730 --> 01:19:28.730]  It purifies very quickly
[01:19:29.730 --> 01:19:30.730]  and it cuts out thousands of chemicals
[01:19:31.730 --> 01:19:32.730]  to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:33.730 --> 01:19:34.730]  This is what I use, which my family uses.
[01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:36.730]  It's the very best system out there
[01:19:37.730 --> 01:19:38.730]  for the lowest price for a limited time.
[01:19:39.730 --> 01:19:40.730]  10% off on top of that exclusively
[01:19:41.730 --> 01:19:42.730]  at InfowarStore.com
[01:19:43.730 --> 01:19:44.730]  on the Alexa Pure water filtration system
[01:19:45.730 --> 01:19:46.730]  today and it funds the Infowar.
[01:19:47.730 --> 01:19:48.730]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:50.730]  This is one of the main areas
[01:19:51.730 --> 01:19:52.730]  we can take control of our lives
[01:19:53.730 --> 01:19:54.730]  and stop the globalists from hitting us
[01:19:55.730 --> 01:19:56.730]  with poison that they allow in the water supply.
[01:19:57.730 --> 01:19:58.730]  In some cases, they add
[01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:00.730]  the water supply like fluoride.
[01:20:01.730 --> 01:20:02.730]  Leading a frontal assault
[01:20:03.730 --> 01:20:04.730]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[01:20:05.730 --> 01:20:06.730]  it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:26.480]  All right, I went off into a spasm of information dealing with human genetics, and I don't claim
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:30.000]  to have degrees or a bunch of stuff in biology, I've just read thousands of papers on it.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:33.960]  So probably 98% of what I was saying was somewhat accurate, but it's just amazing.
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:37.480]  Go look it up for yourself, it'll be way cooler than what I try to describe.
[01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.040]  But just don't, don't believe what I'm saying.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:39.840]  Go check it out for yourselves.
[01:20:39.840 --> 01:20:40.680]  I'm just going from memory.
[01:20:41.240 --> 01:20:45.440]  The point is they did pull one of the studies here, a significant impacts of
[01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.480]  COVID-19 pandemic on race, ethnic diversities, and U S mortality.
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.520]  There's a bunch of these, and this is a big public interest, social
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:59.120]  health research deal, a bunch of colleges and professors crunched the data.
[01:20:59.560 --> 01:21:04.680]  Finally, the pandemic shifted radical ethnic mortality, differentials in favor of
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:09.800]  white people, narrowing the Hispanic advantage and widening the black disadvantage.
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.320]  And so whites and blacks got sick, Hispanics, not as sick because
[01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:16.960]  they're got Chinese genetics.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:21.760]  And Hispanics didn't know that that's the, that's the ethnic, main ethnic group.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:25.680]  But it's Chinese, he called them the Huns or whatever that came across the
[01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:29.600]  bearing, sprayed from, from Russia to Alaska, back when William
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:32.320]  Amazon, all that, if you believe all that, the point is the genetic
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:37.400]  engineers say that that's who peopled the Americas was basically Chinese
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:45.000]  wanderers, you know, Chinese hunter gatherers that did that.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:48.080]  Here's a bunch of other studies on it.
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:50.760]  This is the Lancet medical journal.
[01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:55.320]  Evidence mounts on the disproportionate effect of COVID-19 on ethnic
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.920]  minorities, particularly black people.
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:57.960]  Here's another one.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:05.640]  New insights and genetic susceptibility of COVID-19 and ACE2 and TMPR-SS2
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.440]  polymorphism analysis, and it says it targets blacks and whites more.
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.000]  And it goes on from there.
[01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.840]  So Robert F.
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:15.440]  Kennedy Jr.
[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:19.400]  is saying something very reasonable and I didn't just spend 30 minutes
[01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.720]  defending him just because it's RFK.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.560]  I'm defending the truth.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.600]  That's what matters to me.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.840]  And again, it's not just the US doing this.
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:30.200]  It's not just the UK doing it.
[01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.280]  It's not just the EU doing it.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.480]  Of course, the Russians are messing around with this stuff.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.400]  Of course, the Chinese are messing around with this stuff.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.600]  And what are the chances it's going to get out by accident again?
[01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:45.200]  What are the chances they released this on purpose though?
[01:22:46.200 --> 01:22:47.160]  Pretty much a hundred.
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:51.440]  Look at the timing operation lockstep and then event 201 during it happening.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.200]  And we know it was about the military games and the timing of it.
[01:22:55.240 --> 01:23:00.720]  Yeah, they did it as their UN test drive of tyranny of their UN test drive of
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:05.520]  internet kill switches, lockdowns, social credit scores, social distancing, forced
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.520]  injections, vaccine passports, all of it.
[01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:12.480]  The UN said years before, disease X will bring in our world government.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.840]  There'll soon be a new disease.
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:15.560]  And when it hits, we're going to do this to you.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.760]  And I went, the UN is getting ready to release this with the global list.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:19.440]  They're going to do this.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.480]  And people see the videos of me predicting you'll have to wear a mask six feet apart.
[01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:24.360]  They'll lock you up in your house.
[01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:25.600]  They go, he's one of them.
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.320]  How did he know that?
[01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:29.160]  I was showing you them saying they're going to do it.
[01:23:31.800 --> 01:23:34.160]  Why can't people learn to look this up themselves?
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:38.000]  I mean, it's kind of cool that I'm magic and know all this.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.000]  I'm not, that's what's so frustrating.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:41.720]  We know the enemy plan.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:42.920]  They can be stopped.
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:46.320]  So Victoria Newland comes out earlier this year and says, yeah, we got
[01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.000]  bio labs.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.000]  Yeah, we got to stop the Russians from getting them.
[01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:52.760]  Yeah, it's terrible, but I don't need to have the Russians.
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:54.440]  I don't just believe the Russians and they lie.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:57.440]  Sometimes they put Russian operatives on our show because we have Russian
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:58.080]  reporters on.
[01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:02.000]  We've had Iranian reporters, Japanese reporters, British reporters, French
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.800]  reporters, Brazilian reporters, Mexican reporters, Canadian reporters, Scottish
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:07.960]  reporters, Irish reporters.
[01:24:08.240 --> 01:24:14.040]  You've seen them all here, South African reporters, Nigerian reporters.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:15.520]  We've had them all.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:21.560]  And we right before the Russian invasion had Russian media people on like, no, we
[01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.800]  are not invading.
[01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:24.760]  This is American lies.
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.280]  And meanwhile, the Russian troops were all masked about to go in.
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:30.800]  They were tasked to put the disinfo out so the Russians wouldn't get
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:33.360]  caught and blown up by all the NATO weapons, which they did.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:36.280]  And I'm just looking at the guy going, so you're not invading?
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.560]  No, Mr.
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.000]  Jones, no.
[01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:41.520]  And I'm like, well, why do we see troops matching here?
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:44.080]  Sorry, the connection is breaking up.
[01:24:44.080 --> 01:24:45.720]  We need to say bye-bye now.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:50.320]  So I don't just mindlessly believe the Russians either.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.440]  But when the Russians came out and said, we invaded partly because of these 14
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:58.080]  bioweapon labs that we know are testing race-specific bioweapons, and they
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.640]  released documents of some they'd actually seized, I went and looked it up
[01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:09.560]  and went, oh my gosh, I forgot Obama bragged in 2010, 11 and 12, how he
[01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:14.600]  doubled the funding of the project and built those labs and others to quote,
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.880]  test bioweapons and create cures.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:20.640]  But to have a cure for a bioweapon, you've got to do illegal bioweapon
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:23.600]  development, which violates the treaties and federal law.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.160]  So I did not just believe the Russians on that case.
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:32.640]  I looked at the facts and it was true.
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:39.720]  But then a year later, the ambassador to the NATO new world order combine,
[01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:42.520]  she's been both EU ambassador and NATO.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:43.320]  I forget.
[01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:45.360]  She's been, what is Victoria Newland right now?
[01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:46.440]  I can't even keep track of it.
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:49.520]  We know she's always stirring up trouble, but here she is like four or
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.120]  five months ago admitting that, okay, they're a bioweapon labs.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.920]  Now, remember, you weren't supposed to say that.
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:55.840]  Here it is.
[01:25:58.400 --> 01:26:00.400]  Well, um, I only have a minute left.
[01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:06.400]  Let me ask you, um, does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons?
[01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:16.360]  Uh, Ukraine has, uh, biological research facilities, which in fact,
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:21.840]  we are now quite concerned Russian troops, Russian forces may be seeking
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.960]  to, uh, gain control of.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:30.360]  So we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:35.920]  those research materials from falling into the hands of, uh, Russian
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.720]  forces, should they approach.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:41.200]  I'm sure you're aware that the Russian propaganda groups are
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:43.760]  already putting out there all kinds of information about how they've
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:47.720]  uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release biological weapons in
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.840]  the country and with NATO's coordination.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:53.880]  If there's a biological or chemical weapon incident or, uh, or
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.600]  attack inside of Ukraine, is there any doubt in your mind that
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.880]  100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it?
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.720]  There is no doubt in my mind, Senator, and it is classic Russian,
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:07.760]  uh, technique to blame on the other guy, what they're
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:08.920]  planning to do themselves.
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:14.080]  Classic Russian technique.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:19.840]  Uh, governments have been blaming each other for 6,000 years
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.680]  of recorded history.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:23.680]  It's standard operating procedure, lady, everybody does it.
[01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:27.640]  And the truth is, you heard her though, admit that
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.000]  there's a bioweapon lapse.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:31.440]  So that's the basis of all this.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:32.680]  And whose border are we on?
[01:27:33.520 --> 01:27:35.560]  If the Russians were on our border doing all this stuff, I'd
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:36.640]  say blow the hell out of them.
[01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:41.120]  Hundreds of thousands of Russian troops training people, uh, shelling
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.760]  South Texas, I'd say blow the snot out of them, but they're not folks.
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:48.560]  And the same globalists are coming after your child's genitals and the
[01:27:48.560 --> 01:27:50.920]  same globalists that are coming after your border and coming after your
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:53.120]  pension and coming after your sovereignty.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.440]  The same globalists that are censoring you are the ones doing
[01:27:56.440 --> 01:27:58.680]  this, and it is disgusting.
[01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:03.560]  And it is extremely dangerous to be punching the Russian Baron doing this.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:06.320]  And now there's a big article on Infowars.com and I agree
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.040]  with, uh, with the former CIA agent Johnson on there.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:13.120]  I want to get back on this week if we can, please.
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:17.680]  He does an excellent analysis and he used to be in counterterrorism
[01:28:17.680 --> 01:28:19.520]  all over the world, Europe, you name it, Middle East.
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:20.760]  He said, it's true.
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:22.880]  The Russians have done their military action.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.960]  They defeated the Ukrainians.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:27.520]  They've blown up all the Western equipment, most of it, and they
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.040]  don't have anybody to get in the tanks.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:30.720]  The Ukrainians will not get in the tanks.
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:33.680]  And so they've lost.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:38.760]  And so now what are the globalists going to do?
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:41.400]  They're going to stage a false flag, whether it's chemical, biological,
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.480]  or blowing up the nuclear power plant.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.480]  That's the next move.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:46.280]  I'm not saying the globalists are going to do that.
[01:28:46.280 --> 01:28:48.040]  I'm saying that's the only move they've got left.
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:49.440]  And that's what Johnson was saying.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:53.160]  And it gets worse because of what's happening in the economy.
[01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.320]  We'll talk about that when we come back.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.400]  I want to say brain force is great.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:07.240]  I want to say turbo force is amazing.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:12.440]  It is, but if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it.
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.080]  The fish oil is better than it.
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:15.920]  And that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.200]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.520]  cleanest, the best out there.
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:24.320]  Krill oil is the best and it'll give you the damn burps.
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:25.080]  And I'm just sorry.
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:26.200]  You want something like this?
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:27.160]  You don't get stuff for free.
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:29.120]  The Krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:29.680]  It's so good.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:32.080]  In my view, I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell you
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:35.320]  something that I eat five caplets of krill oil before I go to bed.
[01:29:35.360 --> 01:29:37.080]  I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:43.520]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.960]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just
[01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:52.160]  obsessed because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you.
[01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.160]  I just can't do it.
[01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.160]  Infowarsstore.com
[01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:25.960]  seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:30:26.880 --> 01:30:29.840]  So for myself, the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:30:30.520 --> 01:30:34.320]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars can not stay
[01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:35.640]  on air if you do not support us.
[01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:37.280]  I know you spread the word.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.760]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful.
[01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:41.840]  Keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners never go to
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.240]  Infowarsstore.com and you never buy great products that enrich
[01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:47.720]  and empower your life all at the same time, give us on air.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.680]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy
[01:30:50.680 --> 01:30:52.000]  products in Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:55.760]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.280]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:30:58.400]  Please take action now.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:02.720]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.280]  We want to have all the best brands.
[01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:07.040]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:31:07.280 --> 01:31:10.520]  So I get constant questions online and in person, Hey, what's better?
[01:31:10.520 --> 01:31:13.320]  Knockout what's better down and out.
[01:31:13.480 --> 01:31:14.040]  What's better?
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:15.760]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep eggs?
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:18.880]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:21.320]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:25.560]  So one person might like this coffee and other person likes that coffee.
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.280]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:31:27.280 --> 01:31:30.640]  They're all very diverse, but we've been able to private label a national
[01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:34.360]  bestseller that's been sold for many years that people love and sell
[01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:38.800]  for lower price under the name Infowars MD Good Night Sleep.
[01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:44.520]  This is a great formula full of amazing safe compounds, deeper, cleaner, restful
[01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:49.360]  sleep, and it's in stock available right now of 25% off out of the gates.

[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:29.760]  But these really are amazing products.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.800]  The Big July 4 sale is going on right now.
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:34.520]  This is such a critical platform in the fight against the new world order.
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:36.520]  The enemies out in the open were vindicated.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.680]  People are listening more than ever, but in this major recession going
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.720]  into depression and with supply chain breakdowns, I know it's hard.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:46.120]  I know times are tough, so thank you for your support, but whatever
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:49.080]  you do, pray for the broadcast and share the articles and the videos.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:50.520]  That you can do for free.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.680]  And that's just as important as keeping us on air.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:55.360]  So however, God leads you in your heart to support us, please
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:56.040]  support us now.
[01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:57.280]  And I thank you for the bottom of my heart.
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.240]  God bless you.
[01:32:59.880 --> 01:33:04.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:06.160]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.670 --> 01:33:16.310]  See, my job's so easy.
[01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:20.430]  I don't care if you're an American, a Russian, Chinese, Mexican, doesn't matter to me.
[01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:24.910]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:27.510]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.510 --> 01:33:31.430]  I don't care if you're from the Congo, I don't care if you're from France, I don't
[01:33:31.430 --> 01:33:35.470]  care if you're from Argentina, or whether you're from Easter Island.
[01:33:35.470 --> 01:33:37.510]  You tell the truth, you care about freedom and humanity.
[01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:42.550]  I'm your brother, I'm your sister, I'm your father, I'm your son, we're together.
[01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:46.190]  But when you lie, I'm going to come after you.
[01:33:46.190 --> 01:33:54.550]  So I don't care if it's the Russians lying, or CNN lying.
[01:33:54.550 --> 01:33:56.470]  I don't care who it is, I'm going to expose it.
[01:33:56.470 --> 01:34:00.030]  That's why, again, we've had Russian reporters on before, they're like, no one is invading
[01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:01.030]  next week, no Alex.
[01:34:01.030 --> 01:34:06.790]  I'm like, oh, what about this, sorry, we got to go.
[01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:09.790]  I was like, I'm more sure than ever they're about to invade.
[01:34:09.790 --> 01:34:14.750]  And remember, I understand the country was already invaded by NATO, but the main war
[01:34:14.750 --> 01:34:16.670]  was about to start.
[01:34:16.670 --> 01:34:18.870]  And so I just make that point that my job is so easy.
[01:34:18.870 --> 01:34:22.270]  It's not try to think, what are people going to think of this?
[01:34:22.270 --> 01:34:25.430]  What's the effect politically going to be?
[01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:29.670]  When you do that, you infect your mind with a bunch of questions of politics and
[01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:31.270]  what sounds right.
[01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:35.530]  When you just go with what you believe is accurate from deep research and commitment
[01:34:35.530 --> 01:34:41.870]  to the truth, you almost always get an incredibly good answer that's insanely accurate.
[01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:47.350]  People ask how I know all this stuff, I just, I say what the truth is, the best
[01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:48.350]  truth I've got.
[01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:51.830]  I'm not 100% accurate, I'm not God, far from it.
[01:34:51.830 --> 01:34:54.990]  But people ask, why am I still alive?
[01:34:54.990 --> 01:34:56.830]  Because there's good in the universe, God's real.
[01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:59.070]  I've been protected so far, I'm on a mission.
[01:34:59.070 --> 01:35:03.790]  God told me 27 years ago, I've been on here about two years, and I just had this vision.
[01:35:03.790 --> 01:35:05.190]  It was like a download.
[01:35:05.190 --> 01:35:08.750]  I told the story 100 times when I was sitting there at night, 9 o'clock, doing my local
[01:35:08.750 --> 01:35:12.750]  show on TV, Access Television, went and ate a chicken fried steak, sitting there drinking
[01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:16.190]  an iced tea or beer, I can't remember, I think it was iced tea, I barely even drank
[01:35:16.190 --> 01:35:17.190]  back then.
[01:35:17.190 --> 01:35:23.310]  I've gotten more corrupt as years going on and back then, hell, 27 years ago I might
[01:35:23.310 --> 01:35:25.910]  drink two beers a week, so it's probably iced tea.
[01:35:25.910 --> 01:35:29.710]  And I'm sitting there and I just like all of a sudden felt this presence in the room,
[01:35:29.710 --> 01:35:33.910]  they're like mopping up about to close in 30 minutes, nobody was in there.
[01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:36.590]  And I just sat there for about an hour and then as soon as I was ready to leave,
[01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:39.790]  they opened the door and locked it and I walked out.
[01:35:39.790 --> 01:35:43.430]  And it was just like, this is the whole rest of your life here, son, you ready
[01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:44.430]  to do this?
[01:35:44.430 --> 01:35:45.430]  It's all going to happen.
[01:35:45.430 --> 01:35:46.430]  I saw everything.
[01:35:46.430 --> 01:35:48.630]  It was wild too.
[01:35:48.630 --> 01:35:54.110]  And like God shaded the individuals, the personalities, the people, I wasn't shown who it would be
[01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:55.110]  or what happened.
[01:35:55.310 --> 01:35:58.070]  It was like, and you're going to do this and you're going to get persecuted, but it's
[01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:59.070]  going to explode.
[01:35:59.070 --> 01:36:02.550]  And then all these people are going to wake up and it's going to have this giant effect.
[01:36:02.550 --> 01:36:07.550]  And then it's going to build towards that understanding before the Antichrist takes
[01:36:07.550 --> 01:36:12.270]  over and enslaves people for a few years and kills billions of people.
[01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:16.030]  But then out of that, Satan winning in the third quarter, it's the best way to
[01:36:16.030 --> 01:36:18.710]  humanly describe it, it was way more advanced than that.
[01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:23.950]  Then out of the work you've done and others do now to plant the seeds, that great
[01:36:23.990 --> 01:36:29.190]  tyranny of the devil will be like sunlight and rain on the seeds and there'll be this
[01:36:29.190 --> 01:36:35.430]  giant harvest, the biggest ever that will bring down Satan's empire.
[01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:37.670]  But we've got to be ready.
[01:36:37.670 --> 01:36:39.590]  I like it to be caught in a riptide.
[01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:43.670]  I've never been caught in a really bad one, but I've been caught in a medium sized
[01:36:43.670 --> 01:36:49.310]  one in Texas once and then a pretty good one in Hawaii one time because I didn't mind
[01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:50.310]  the flags.
[01:36:50.310 --> 01:36:52.710]  Usually you see the flag or red flags that you're like, yeah, right.
[01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:53.710]  That's not a big current.
[01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:58.750]  And I just got pulled off for a while and person might panic, try to swim back to
[01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:02.470]  shore, but I just waited and get sucked me out about 300 yards and kicked me out.
[01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:06.230]  And I was able to come back to land, but a really powerful riptide will grab
[01:37:06.230 --> 01:37:07.230]  you and suck you under.
[01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:10.790]  And you've got to usually know that it's going to kick you out in 30 seconds
[01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:11.630]  or a minute.
[01:37:11.630 --> 01:37:14.910]  And then you just got to hold your breath, relax, and know you're going to
[01:37:14.910 --> 01:37:17.190]  get shot back out on the surface very soon.
[01:37:17.190 --> 01:37:18.030]  You're buoyant.
[01:37:18.030 --> 01:37:19.110]  You've got oxygen in your lungs.
[01:37:19.110 --> 01:37:20.470]  You're, you know, you got fat.
[01:37:20.470 --> 01:37:21.590]  Just hold your breath, relax.
[01:37:21.590 --> 01:37:22.790]  You're going to get kicked out.
[01:37:22.830 --> 01:37:24.070]  People panic, try to get to the surface.
[01:37:24.070 --> 01:37:25.030]  They breathe water.
[01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:26.710]  They die on the riptide.
[01:37:26.710 --> 01:37:29.430]  And I describe what we're about to go through.
[01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:32.910]  What we're already actually in is we're going to get sucked into the
[01:37:32.910 --> 01:37:34.670]  riptide and it's not going to be one minute.
[01:37:34.670 --> 01:37:39.070]  It's going to be more like three, four minutes in the scheme of time, years.
[01:37:39.070 --> 01:37:43.670]  And you're going to have to really just focus on God and relax and turn loose.
[01:37:43.670 --> 01:37:45.190]  And then you're going to get shot right back out.
[01:37:45.190 --> 01:37:47.870]  It's like, you're suddenly shot right back out.
[01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:50.350]  And it's like, wow, I'm free of this whole thing.
[01:37:50.350 --> 01:37:52.630]  And this is the process we have to go through.
[01:37:52.630 --> 01:37:54.230]  It's like birthing pains.
[01:37:54.230 --> 01:37:56.030]  And we're here.
[01:37:56.030 --> 01:37:59.350]  But I played the Victoria Newland clip.
[01:37:59.350 --> 01:38:03.390]  You just heard her admitting, yeah, we got bio labs, but they're defensive.
[01:38:03.390 --> 01:38:05.790]  I thought they didn't exist.
[01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:09.630]  And again, they knew anybody could go to a newspaper and see Obama bragging
[01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:13.110]  about them, but they have disdain for you.
[01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:17.430]  But I'll tell you, if you don't learn to research, myself included, if we don't
[01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:20.870]  learn to be aware of the real world, instead of doing about football and Tom
[01:38:20.910 --> 01:38:25.510]  Brady statistics or Michael Jordan or Larry Bird statistics, like, I mean,
[01:38:25.510 --> 01:38:27.310]  I see these huge sites online.
[01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:30.590]  I can even get caught up in it, like everything about Michael Jordan,
[01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:33.230]  everything about Larry Bird, everything about Magic Johnson,
[01:38:33.230 --> 01:38:39.990]  everything about who cares what some dude shot in baskets or who he's
[01:38:39.990 --> 01:38:45.030]  married to or how much he's paid.
[01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:46.670]  It's not important.
[01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:51.070]  Man, I basically drank hot sauce at lunch.
[01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:56.270]  I'm going to eat Mexican food, my wife and Kent Hacken lively,
[01:38:56.270 --> 01:38:58.510]  finishing up the book.
[01:38:58.510 --> 01:39:01.630]  And I'm just like this pepper addict.
[01:39:01.630 --> 01:39:07.750]  And I ate a whole plate of jalapenos and then two big old giant serranos
[01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:08.670]  and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:39:08.670 --> 01:39:15.670]  So I'm having a little bit of a explosive, what do you call that?
[01:39:15.670 --> 01:39:18.950]  That's where the acid comes up your throat.
[01:39:18.950 --> 01:39:26.870]  I went a little crazy today, a little Mr. Piggy when it came to the peppers.
[01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:31.590]  So we have all this information and we know what's going on and we know
[01:39:31.590 --> 01:39:35.230]  they're producing illegal things that could destroy us and destroy our
[01:39:35.230 --> 01:39:39.830]  families and destroy the world that are illegal.
[01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:43.670]  And the larger question is, why are we putting up with it?
[01:39:43.670 --> 01:39:45.510]  The social contract is broken.
[01:39:45.510 --> 01:39:47.390]  Criminals have hijacked the government.
[01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:49.950]  They're trying to destabilize us so they can enslave us.
[01:39:49.950 --> 01:39:50.910]  We have to speak up.
[01:39:50.910 --> 01:39:51.750]  We have to say no.
[01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:56.190]  We have to realize that the only shot we've got is saying no to this thing.
[01:39:56.190 --> 01:39:57.430]  We didn't ask for the fight.
[01:39:57.430 --> 01:40:00.870]  We weren't looking for the fight, but they came with the fight.
[01:40:00.870 --> 01:40:03.630]  In fact, I asked Rob Dew on Monday to make a promo.
[01:40:03.630 --> 01:40:04.670]  He did.
[01:40:04.670 --> 01:40:05.790]  Then we should go out to break with it.
[01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:08.750]  It's about a minute and a half long, but it's that member of parliament out of
[01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:13.070]  Germany in the EU parliament, Christina, whatever her name is.
[01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:14.790]  And she's like, we didn't look for the fight.
[01:40:14.790 --> 01:40:16.110]  We didn't ask for the fight.
[01:40:16.110 --> 01:40:17.950]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:40:17.950 --> 01:40:19.270]  If you can't find it now, don't worry about it.
[01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:21.430]  We'll come back and play the star of the next segment.
[01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:24.710]  But, but really that's what we're talking about here.
[01:40:24.710 --> 01:40:29.070]  And as soon as you heard them say there aren't bio weapon labs in Ukraine,
[01:40:29.070 --> 01:40:30.990]  why did you go research that?
[01:40:30.990 --> 01:40:35.070]  Because again, you need to check everything this government says.
[01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:39.270]  And when you find out that almost all of it's alive, then you ask yourself,
[01:40:39.270 --> 01:40:44.990]  is this my government or is this criminals that have taken control of it?
[01:40:44.990 --> 01:40:46.390]  All right.
[01:40:46.390 --> 01:40:55.750]  I've got footage that is of an actual vampire propositioning women.
[01:40:55.750 --> 01:40:58.670]  Now, if you're a new viewer listener, I want you to understand something.
[01:40:58.670 --> 01:41:00.870]  I don't say these things to be shocking.
[01:41:00.870 --> 01:41:02.750]  I don't say these things as a joke.
[01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:05.230]  I don't say these things to impress you.
[01:41:05.230 --> 01:41:08.630]  If I tell you something and I'm sure about it,
[01:41:08.670 --> 01:41:10.550]  you can bet your bottom dollar that it's accurate.
[01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:11.990]  Okay.
[01:41:11.990 --> 01:41:18.070]  So I want you to listen to me very, very carefully.
[01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:23.430]  We're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:28.910]  And we're going to come back and I'm going to show you a real live vampire.
[01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:33.030]  And I'm not going to just show you a vampire.
[01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:35.990]  I'm going to show you a vampire that drinks the blood of children,
[01:41:35.990 --> 01:41:36.910]  its own children.
[01:41:36.910 --> 01:41:37.390]  Here's the clip.
[01:41:39.190 --> 01:41:44.950]  We are here today to tell you, you picked this fight.
[01:41:44.950 --> 01:41:46.830]  You wanted this fight.
[01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:48.590]  Well, guess what?
[01:41:48.590 --> 01:41:50.310]  You've got it.
[01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:53.070]  Let's fight.
[01:41:53.070 --> 01:41:55.390]  It's 11 59 at Radio Free America.
[01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:58.310]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[01:41:58.310 --> 01:42:00.470]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and
[01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:02.310]  sisters in the occupied zone.
[01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:04.390]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:42:04.390 --> 01:42:06.550]  The chair is against the wall.
[01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:08.590]  John has a long mustache.
[01:42:08.590 --> 01:42:10.630]  John has a long mustache.
[01:42:10.630 --> 01:42:11.950]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:13.670]  Another day closer to victory.
[01:42:13.670 --> 01:42:17.670]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:42:17.670 --> 01:42:24.790]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say,
[01:42:24.790 --> 01:42:28.190]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:42:28.190 --> 01:42:30.950]  You better believe you've got one.
[01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:32.470]  Yes.
[01:42:32.470 --> 01:42:36.030]  From the front lines of the information war.
[01:42:36.030 --> 01:42:38.030]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:47.630]  I'm going to show you a real vampire when we come back.
[01:42:47.630 --> 01:42:52.830]  A vampire that grows its own children to drink their blood.
[01:42:58.870 --> 01:43:02.430]  The globalists aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the
[01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:05.270]  electromagnetic 5g or the GMO crops.
[01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:09.670]  They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized
[01:43:09.670 --> 01:43:11.670]  companies and industry to use.
[01:43:11.670 --> 01:43:15.030]  One of the top pesticides used is Atrazine.
[01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:16.270]  The allowable level.
[01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:19.270]  The government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough
[01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:24.110]  to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant.
[01:43:24.110 --> 01:43:25.270]  Look it up.
[01:43:25.270 --> 01:43:26.670]  Don't let them do this to your family.
[01:43:26.670 --> 01:43:29.790]  We have the very best gravity fed filter system out there.
[01:43:29.830 --> 01:43:33.070]  Highest rated at half the price of leading competitors.
[01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:35.390]  The Alexa pure ready to ship to you right now.
[01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:37.670]  We have replacement filters for folks who have already gotten it.
[01:43:37.670 --> 01:43:39.550]  It does 10,000 gallons where you replace them.
[01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:40.550]  It is amazing.
[01:43:40.550 --> 01:43:42.230]  It's great for your home, your business.
[01:43:42.230 --> 01:43:45.350]  You can put swamp water in it, tap water, whatever, well water,
[01:43:45.350 --> 01:43:46.830]  almost everything's contaminated.
[01:43:46.830 --> 01:43:49.750]  This is how you take control of the fluids in your body and counter
[01:43:49.750 --> 01:43:50.870]  the globalist onslaught.

[01:44:04.190 --> 01:44:06.790]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[01:44:06.790 --> 01:44:09.830]  the fact that we're not caught flat-footed during their major
[01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:11.790]  takeover is because of you.
[01:44:11.790 --> 01:44:14.830]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[01:44:45.670 --> 01:44:48.870]  to take action now and be part of the global awakening,
[01:44:48.870 --> 01:44:51.790]  the new renaissance that's countering the great reset by going
[01:44:51.790 --> 01:44:55.150]  to infowarsetour.com and clicking on the Donate button
[01:44:55.150 --> 01:44:56.030]  and giving today.
[01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:57.470]  Thank you so much for your support.
[01:44:57.470 --> 01:44:58.750]  Please take action.
[01:44:58.750 --> 01:45:01.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset
[01:45:01.230 --> 01:45:03.270]  and the War for the World, is a historic book
[01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:05.470]  that documents the globalists in their own words,
[01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:08.430]  planned for our future that is a hellish future.
[01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:10.710]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books,
[01:45:10.710 --> 01:45:11.990]  I guess, they're starting to ban them,
[01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:14.110]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset
[01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:16.510]  and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon,
[01:45:16.510 --> 01:45:17.830]  or infowarsetour.com.
[01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:20.150]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy
[01:45:20.150 --> 01:45:23.430]  of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:25.950]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[01:45:25.950 --> 01:45:27.870]  So get your copy of The Great Reset
[01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:30.150]  and the War for the World, a signed copy
[01:45:30.150 --> 01:45:31.350]  at infowarsetour.com.
[01:45:31.350 --> 01:45:34.150]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser
[01:45:34.150 --> 01:45:35.270]  to keep us on the air.
[01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:37.470]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:38.310]  and this powerful book.
[01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:41.150]  You'll also know that you help keep infowars on the air.
[01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:42.470]  I'm gonna thank those of you that have gotten
[01:45:42.470 --> 01:45:45.110]  signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[01:45:45.110 --> 01:45:48.030]  But I wanna encourage all of you who haven't yet
[01:45:48.030 --> 01:45:50.750]  to go to infowarsetour.com and get a signed copy
[01:45:50.750 --> 01:45:52.270]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[01:45:52.270 --> 01:45:55.470]  and donate to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:45:55.590 --> 01:45:56.550]  This is an Infowar.
[01:45:56.550 --> 01:45:58.430]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.

[01:46:47.630 --> 01:46:49.990]  1776 worldwide.
[01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:53.270]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:46:53.270 --> 01:46:55.950]  And the answer for energy is Brainforce.
[01:46:57.740 --> 01:47:20.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:20.740 --> 01:47:31.660]  Long before Bram Stoker, 150 years ago, wrote Dracula, every culture from the Japanese,
[01:47:31.660 --> 01:47:37.300]  the ancient Greeks, the ancient Africans, the ancient Mesoamericans, the ancient Europeans
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:44.900]  believed that sometimes, at key times, at night, the undead walked the earth and sought
[01:47:44.900 --> 01:47:52.000]  for the blood of innocents, particularly the children, to drink their blood to live forever.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:59.719]  Where does that archetype come from? Where does that legend come from? And then I began
[01:47:59.719 --> 01:48:04.900]  to study world history 30 plus years ago. I didn't believe in vampires. I didn't believe
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:09.960]  in space aliens. I didn't believe in chubacabras or leprechauns or the tooth fairy or Santa
[01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:18.620]  Claus or the Easter Bunny for that matter. But then I learned that they don't exist,
[01:48:18.620 --> 01:48:27.320]  but the things that become a legend out of them do. There's a kernel of truth. And
[01:48:27.320 --> 01:48:34.719]  when you know that kernel, that's a key to a whole nother world of just peasants
[01:48:34.719 --> 01:48:39.099]  all over the world, just regular people talking about what they were seeing and what
[01:48:39.139 --> 01:48:45.260]  was happening. At night, they come, they take children, they drink their blood. Why did
[01:48:45.260 --> 01:48:57.080]  every culture say that? They weren't making it up because it's the exact same story.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:00.940]  What put that genetic memory in us? What put that archetype in us? So then I began
[01:49:00.940 --> 01:49:06.460]  to study a little bit. I'm like, the British royalty are not British at all, not one
[01:49:06.460 --> 01:49:10.179]  drop of blood. In fact, they hate the British and the Irish and the Scots and train them
[01:49:10.179 --> 01:49:13.519]  to all kill each other. Because the Brits were the biggest group, they trained them
[01:49:13.519 --> 01:49:18.500]  to hate the Scots and the Irish. It was all the same family. They weren't even German.
[01:49:18.500 --> 01:49:23.179]  They weren't even Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. They were Transylvanian. They were the house
[01:49:23.179 --> 01:49:31.099]  of the dragon Dracul. And the main line, direct descendant of Vlad the Impaler,
[01:49:31.099 --> 01:49:39.860]  the real Count Dracula is King Charles of his Britannic majesty.
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:44.059]  So then I studied Jeffrey Epstein and MI6, Mossad, CIA. I study what they're really
[01:49:44.059 --> 01:49:48.820]  doing at Zorro Ranch, New Mexico, in the Nygaard's big facilities and in cloning
[01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:55.740]  operations down in the Bahamas and down in the Caribbean. And Epstein and Omer are
[01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:59.179]  like, yeah, I was having babies for them. We don't know why. They were killing the
[01:49:59.179 --> 01:50:07.700]  babies and sucking all of their blood out and all of their reproductive cells
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:17.860]  out and all of their regenerative cells out. Not just the supposed cells
[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:23.460]  that regenerate, but all of them. And injecting them into the veins and
[01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:29.019]  arteries of Peter Nygaard. And it's true what Peter Nygaard says in a club
[01:50:29.059 --> 01:50:34.139]  I'm about to play. He would pay black women thousands of dollars, hundreds of
[01:50:34.139 --> 01:50:38.460]  thousands in some cases, to be impregnated and to live at his medical
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:48.340]  facility so that he could get the baby, his baby, and suck all of its cells
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:53.540]  out and inject them because he thought if it was his son or daughter, it had
[01:50:53.540 --> 01:50:58.019]  better cells. And when he said black women have this gift, it's true that
[01:50:58.019 --> 01:51:04.820]  black people in the genetic testing are like the original or it's the hard
[01:51:04.820 --> 01:51:14.139]  code based software. And so if you get these cells out of the baby that
[01:51:14.139 --> 01:51:17.940]  you have or out of the placenta or the cord, but they use it all, he
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:23.380]  just tells them, oh, it's just a cord. It has incredible life extension
[01:51:23.380 --> 01:51:27.380]  in it. But you know, I don't just believe girlfriends or wives of this
[01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:31.500]  billionaire who's now in jail for human sex trafficking and slavery
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:37.820]  underage and of age. I have countless videos of him in stock pitches to
[01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:42.340]  Bill Gates and the rest of them who would go to the island along with
[01:51:42.980 --> 01:51:51.580]  Robert De Niro to get the essence of murdered babies. You say, hey,
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:55.260]  they weren't born yet. They're not a human. The point is, folks, you
[01:51:55.260 --> 01:52:00.179]  hear about vampires. Count Dracula would bring his women, the women he
[01:52:00.179 --> 01:52:03.900]  had turned to vampires, a baby for a black Sabbath. They would drink
[01:52:03.900 --> 01:52:07.179]  the blood of a baby. He would drink the blood of women or of
[01:52:07.179 --> 01:52:11.620]  powerful men he defeated. They drank the blood of babies and
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:14.580]  Renfield would go out. It was only part vampire. He would eat
[01:52:14.580 --> 01:52:19.139]  bugs. Notice Bill Gates says, you will eat the bugs. Their
[01:52:19.139 --> 01:52:23.820]  slaves only eat bugs and rats, but they drink the blood of
[01:52:23.860 --> 01:52:30.540]  children and others. So Peter Nygaard literally on forget what
[01:52:30.540 --> 01:52:33.980]  his girlfriend and wife said. We're going to show you the video
[01:52:33.980 --> 01:52:38.940]  of him saying, I'm willing to pay you money right now to get
[01:52:38.940 --> 01:52:41.380]  pregnant with me will artificially inseminate. You don't have sex
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:47.500]  with me. I want the baby. I want to kill my own baby and
[01:52:47.500 --> 01:52:53.740]  suck its blood and suck its regenerative cells out and give
[01:52:53.780 --> 01:52:58.540]  it to myself. So he's not just saying I'm a vampire that wants a
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:53:02.059]  baby's essence like the Skeksis in the Dark Crystal. This is
[01:53:02.059 --> 01:53:04.860]  for real. And he did it. Portly hundreds of babies he
[01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:10.500]  consumed. This is a dream come for real. He wants black
[01:53:10.740 --> 01:53:16.019]  women to get pregnant with his demonic ass, his mutant ass.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:22.059]  And it's true. I'm a mutant too, but I'm not trying to
[01:53:22.059 --> 01:53:26.900]  drain black women. And he literally then wants to get their
[01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:30.340]  essence and absorb it instead of having a beautiful kid loving
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:32.780]  this woman and seeing the child grow up and you live forever
[01:53:32.780 --> 01:53:36.940]  through that. No, no, no. You want to murder a black baby and
[01:53:36.940 --> 01:53:43.260]  suck its juices out. So you live longer, you monster. This
[01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:47.700]  isn't the Dark Crystal. This isn't Cal Dracula. This is real.
[01:53:52.059 --> 01:53:52.740]  Here he is.
[01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:02.219]  Stem cell technology that Peter and I are investing in, it's
[01:54:02.219 --> 01:54:07.340]  called SCNT, which takes the egg of a young, fervent woman
[01:54:07.340 --> 01:54:11.019]  specimen, takes the egg and takes out the nucleus and puts
[01:54:11.019 --> 01:54:19.179]  our DNA in the nucleus. It's egg-wide. And this is part of
[01:54:19.380 --> 01:54:24.460]  genetic greatness that we don't see in any other race on the
[01:54:24.460 --> 01:54:30.940]  planet. These curvy, sexy black women from Africa. You girls
[01:54:30.940 --> 01:54:35.820]  have a kind of a monopoly on this genetic perfection. And we
[01:54:35.860 --> 01:54:43.980]  want some of that. So girls, for $100 to pay you for your
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:53.179]  $100. Look how disgusted these women are. Back it up. They
[01:54:53.179 --> 01:54:55.580]  start with an egg. Then they go, well, we want a placenta. We
[01:54:55.580 --> 01:54:58.059]  want to, we want you to kill your baby at four weeks. We
[01:54:58.059 --> 01:55:00.940]  want the umbilical cord. Then they go, we actually want the
[01:55:00.940 --> 01:55:03.860]  baby. Now these are two vampires that are trafficking
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:06.740]  this, who did all this to reportedly thousands of babies.
[01:55:06.860 --> 01:55:10.860]  Total, they sold other men like Bill Gates and others. And
[01:55:10.860 --> 01:55:14.380]  Pepsi was doing it too at Zorro Ranch, literally wanting to
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:18.740]  suck babies dry and pump it into these men's veins. And
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:21.540]  here they are trying to seduce these women to do this.
[01:55:21.540 --> 01:55:24.300]  Listen, first, it's an egg. 30 seconds later, it's their
[01:55:24.300 --> 01:55:25.500]  whole baby. Listen to this.
[01:55:30.180 --> 01:55:34.299]  So girls, for $100 to pay you for your egg.
[01:55:40.860 --> 01:55:44.740]  How much do you want for it? Let's bid. I bid $500 for you.
[01:55:44.740 --> 01:55:49.219]  Whatever I bid, he's going to outbid me.
[01:55:49.219 --> 01:55:54.620]  In front of a $16,000 of the eggs, yeah. If you have a
[01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:58.700]  portion, that's very valuable. The umbilical cord, you
[01:55:58.700 --> 01:56:05.059]  know, placenta, you know, your period blood is so rich
[01:56:05.059 --> 01:56:09.340]  with stem cells. We regard it as wasted. It actually should
[01:56:10.139 --> 01:56:15.420]  be captured as recycled. And it shouldn't go to waste. It's
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:19.460]  life for somebody else. And it's life for mankind.
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:23.620]  Notice how sick the women are about to vomit. He's like a
[01:56:23.620 --> 01:56:26.219]  drug addict talking about crack. He wants the essence of
[01:56:26.219 --> 01:56:29.540]  children. He wants, I mean, you're seeing this is, he's
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:32.299]  just a guy like Epstein that gets it for the elites. This
[01:56:32.299 --> 01:56:35.299]  guy's a billionaire, but he's collecting this from black
[01:56:35.299 --> 01:56:37.500]  women to inject it in Bill Gates. Continue.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.900]  It's life for somebody else.
[01:56:42.019 --> 01:56:43.740]  And it's life for mankind.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:48.460]  The best best days are 60 to 18 years old. Those are the
[01:56:48.460 --> 01:56:48.980]  best things.
[01:56:49.620 --> 01:56:55.099]  As you get older, your eggs get bigger. Thank you. So you
[01:56:55.099 --> 01:56:55.660]  may not be
[01:56:56.860 --> 01:56:59.580]  No, that's fine. Anyway,
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:05.380]  cloning yourself with the idea of making yourself immortal, I
[01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:06.219]  think is
[01:57:07.099 --> 01:57:10.740]  that's enough. So he gets the supermodels, gorgeous women,
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:14.700]  gorgeous black women by any is beautiful thing. And they're
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:18.820]  rejecting him. So he gets mad. This is what they did. He
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:21.980]  had a whole medical facility. And you notice the first guy
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:24.980]  pitches them on clones. They want these women to grow a
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.660]  Peter Nygaard clone in them. So it's it's his baby. It's
[01:57:28.660 --> 01:57:35.219]  him. So he can suck his own baby dry and ingest himself.
[01:57:36.219 --> 01:57:39.059]  Oh, and shorter takes over now info words.com board slash show,

[01:58:08.540 --> 01:58:11.780]  supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your
