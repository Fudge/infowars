[00:00:23.231 --> 00:00:28.757]  It's only 75 days to the midterms, the most important election undoubtedly not just in U.S.
[00:00:28.757 --> 00:00:30.519]  history, but world history.
[00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:37.037]  I have confirmed incredible news just in the last 30 minutes on so many fronts.
[00:00:37.037 --> 00:00:40.199]  It is unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:47.264]  This is the front lines of the fight to restore the republic and bring down the globalist crime syndicate expanding worldwide.
[00:00:47.264 --> 00:00:48.484]  All right.
[00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:53.167]  Let's get right into the news, ladies and gentlemen, because this is unbelievable.
[00:00:53.167 --> 00:00:53.928]  Next segment.
[00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:56.253]  I walked in here at 10 a.m.
[00:00:56.253 --> 00:00:58.714]  from doing research at my house.
[00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:14.358]  The news came in, Owen Schroyer's and Roger Stone's own private account on YouTube that they set up like a year ago to have a backup of their own shows, their own commentary, The War Room.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.403]  Not connected to my accounts that have all been deleted.
[00:01:18.403 --> 00:01:35.280]  It has been taken down and I have the letter from Google and YouTube saying we showed violence and that only violence can be shown in documentary format, which means PBS, CNN, they can show violence when they want to show it to you, but we're not allowed to.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.742]  It's judged as if
[00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:46.977]  It's an evil thing, and you know the headlines will be Jones or Roger Stone and Owen Schroer suspended for bullying children again.
[00:01:46.977 --> 00:01:59.707]  It's the footage that we're not even going to show here, just as an example, so they can't have their way for lawsuits and things that are obviously being developed right now with very, very serious groups and the President and others.
[00:01:59.707 --> 00:02:02.769]  And I will be delivering information to the President today.
[00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:09.600]  On the Sherman antitrust actions and on the top law firms that put together... I'll just leave it at that.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.522]  These are top law firms, the highest levels of the Republican Party.
[00:02:12.522 --> 00:02:21.187]  So, Facebook, Google, Apple, all you guys, you're getting hauled up before Congress right now?
[00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:23.769]  About how your phones listen to people even when they think they're off?
[00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.861]  You're not going to get away with any of this.
[00:02:26.861 --> 00:02:28.723]  Apple struggles to reassure Feds.
[00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:30.804]  Our iPhones are not spying on people.
[00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:32.466]  Your own patents admit you do it.
[00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:34.027]  Your own admissions.
[00:02:34.027 --> 00:02:36.889]  Your own policy reports to shareholders.
[00:02:36.889 --> 00:02:38.931]  We've got your ass.
[00:02:38.931 --> 00:02:41.773]  And I'm going to send them all those reports as well.
[00:02:41.773 --> 00:02:43.214]  You think you're going to shut us down?
[00:02:43.214 --> 00:02:45.055]  You think you're going to kick me off the air?
[00:02:45.055 --> 00:02:47.077]  I'll just hand deliver it to everybody.
[00:02:47.077 --> 00:02:49.198]  I'll just become a lobbyist for freedom.
[00:02:49.198 --> 00:02:50.880]  The worst you've ever seen.
[00:02:53.336 --> 00:02:55.177]  Which is a smarter way to go after you to begin with.
[00:02:55.177 --> 00:03:02.543]  I just believe in the people and I've been trying to reach all of them so they'd wake up and vote for some people like Trump so we could turn this country around, which is now happening.
[00:03:02.543 --> 00:03:04.384]  When I come back I'm gonna break it all down.
[00:03:04.384 --> 00:03:15.053]  Then Jack Posobiec has confirmed from his sources, investigative journalists, with One American News, that they are planning to indict Donald Trump Jr.
[00:03:15.053 --> 00:03:19.236]  That Mueller is moving forward with that, not for the Trump Tower meeting that was totally legal,
[00:03:20.472 --> 00:03:25.637]  But, claiming that he misled Feds, which they could make up and charge anybody with that.
[00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:28.860]  So, this is a true constitutional crisis.
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:37.227]  With 75 days left, this is an insane time to be alive, but whatever you do, understand, InfoWars is not a loser.
[00:03:37.227 --> 00:03:38.549]  InfoWars is not a victim.
[00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.892]  We are targets, just like Tommy Robinson said about himself.
[00:03:41.892 --> 00:03:43.053]  And you're a target as well.
[00:03:44.332 --> 00:03:45.633]  We chose this fight.
[00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:46.593]  We're beginning to win.
[00:03:46.593 --> 00:03:54.216]  The enemy's showing their hand out of fear and is engaging in incredible crimes, but it's hitting.
[00:03:54.216 --> 00:04:02.519]  Just like you have white farmers being slaughtered all over South Africa and their land being taken and the British government agreeing with it and Trump says it's wrong and the media demonizes him.
[00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:11.303]  We showed footage that the national news can show, but again that they're saying info wars can't because of the subjective
[00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:19.645]  Question of saying, well, we think you show footage of when we went and looked at the three-hour show they banned.
[00:04:19.645 --> 00:04:20.306]  We scanned through it.
[00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:26.695]  The only thing is a black man beating up a white man in a store and calling him racial names.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.801]  That happened to a black person and a white person.
[00:04:29.801 --> 00:04:31.863]  They showed on the news, wouldn't they?
[00:04:31.863 --> 00:04:37.307]  And then, looks like a teenager with the black teacher hitting him in the head with a mop.
[00:04:37.307 --> 00:04:38.387]  It's been all over everywhere.
[00:04:38.387 --> 00:04:39.868]  Everybody else can show it.
[00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:43.891]  They can show it on WorldStarHipHop and go, yeah, get that cracker head.
[00:04:43.891 --> 00:04:48.275]  But you can't show it here and say it's wrong and show the FBI crime statistics.
[00:04:48.275 --> 00:04:54.439]  For every white person that attacks a black person, a white person is attacked 12 times more often.
[00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:55.860]  It's very, very sad.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:56.360]  Stay with us.
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.981]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:00.293 --> 00:05:04.395]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[00:05:04.395 --> 00:05:11.479]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:16.301]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[00:05:16.301 --> 00:05:23.865]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will
[00:05:25.806 --> 00:05:39.212]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[00:05:39.212 --> 00:05:46.296]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[00:05:46.676 --> 00:05:59.453]  Head to infowarsstore.com and whether it's your first water filtration purchase or you're looking to replace your current rundown systems, it's time to go big and go home with the Pro-Pure Whole House Filtration System today!
[00:06:07.632 --> 00:06:12.497]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:16.281]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[00:06:21.224 --> 00:06:26.848]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have extremely brave news for you.
[00:06:26.848 --> 00:06:39.618]  Roger Stone, as you know, is at the center of the fake Russiagate investigation that's really meant to steal back the populist election of 2016 of Donald John Trump and the whole turnaround of America.
[00:06:39.618 --> 00:06:41.019]  Donald Trump Jr.
[00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:50.286]  is set to be indicted by the Mueller Kangaroo Grand Jury directly out of the DC swamp.
[00:06:52.086 --> 00:06:55.828]  And this is meant to push the president into a constitutional crisis.
[00:06:55.828 --> 00:07:00.251]  They're going to indict him for lying to the FBI, giving misleading statements.
[00:07:00.251 --> 00:07:08.737]  And again, you have a pack of Democrats running this, over 37 of them now, all Democrats, except for Mueller, who is a swamp creature put in by Bush to cover up 9-11.
[00:07:11.038 --> 00:07:13.299]  He famously was engaged in a lot of other big cover-ups.
[00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:16.301]  The world exclusive was posted yesterday.
[00:07:16.301 --> 00:07:18.602]  Mueller preparing to indict Donald Trump Jr.
[00:07:18.602 --> 00:07:24.225]  Everyone needs to get the video and get it out and post it on every other platform.
[00:07:24.225 --> 00:07:33.631]  They are only trying to deplatform InfoWars and thousands of other major conservative and libertarian nationalist groups ahead of their main move against America.
[00:07:33.631 --> 00:07:38.974]  Mueller goes back on both sides of his family to the top robber barons
[00:07:40.063 --> 00:07:42.584]  That owned and ran the major railroads.
[00:07:42.584 --> 00:07:44.245]  Look it up!
[00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:48.287]  He's actually related to Anderson Cooper, who's an aster.
[00:07:48.287 --> 00:07:49.748]  He's an aster.
[00:07:49.748 --> 00:07:51.929]  You can go back even, it's bizarre.
[00:07:51.929 --> 00:07:53.290]  Chevy Chase is an aster.
[00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:56.272]  I mean, it's just this whole group out of New York, folks.
[00:07:56.272 --> 00:07:59.514]  Total, absolute bluebloods.
[00:07:59.514 --> 00:08:01.975]  And they just think they own this country.
[00:08:02.967 --> 00:08:12.370]  Disgrace and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole gang of angry Democrat thugs spent over 30 hours with White House counsel only by approval and he waived executive privilege for purposes of transparency.
[00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:20.894]  Anybody needing that much time when they know there's no Russian collusion is just someone who's again desperate and knows they have nothing, no collusion.
[00:08:20.894 --> 00:08:21.594]  And ladies and gentlemen...
[00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:23.501]  That's the issue.
[00:08:23.501 --> 00:08:34.224]  They now have Cohen, who it turns out was running his own criminal enterprises, he pleads guilty to, at a taxi place, no connection to Trump, $20 million laundered money.
[00:08:34.224 --> 00:08:37.065]  And then you've got him trying to record Trump over the years.
[00:08:37.065 --> 00:08:41.526]  He's probably been an informant against Trump for five years, I would guess.
[00:08:41.526 --> 00:08:43.127]  He's sneaking in, trying to set Trump up.
[00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:46.442]  Hell, we gotta pay this lady off financing.
[00:08:46.442 --> 00:08:47.562]  I'm not doing financing.
[00:08:47.562 --> 00:08:48.602]  What are you talking about?
[00:08:48.602 --> 00:08:50.303]  That's the dirt they've got.
[00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:52.183]  And now he says, I'll say Trump's a Russian.
[00:08:52.183 --> 00:08:54.884]  I'll say there's collusion.
[00:08:54.884 --> 00:08:57.725]  You're a stool pigeon!
[00:08:57.725 --> 00:09:02.326]  You're an indicted, already informant against the president.
[00:09:02.326 --> 00:09:03.166]  You're a snake.
[00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:05.147]  You're a dirty rat.
[00:09:05.147 --> 00:09:08.668]  But again, Donald Trump Jr., a total patriot.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:18.804]  Total patriot for this country, now in the enemy crosshairs, trying to make the president roll over and say, I'll do what your agenda is.
[00:09:18.804 --> 00:09:20.385]  We'll take TPP back.
[00:09:20.385 --> 00:09:23.327]  I won't have tariffs on China that's ripping us off.
[00:09:23.327 --> 00:09:26.408]  I'll let you teach, you know, five-year-olds that they're the opposite sex.
[00:09:26.408 --> 00:09:29.490]  I'll let you do whatever you want.
[00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:30.871]  Just leave my family alone.
[00:09:30.871 --> 00:09:34.172]  But you know what?
[00:09:34.172 --> 00:09:36.674]  DJT is not going to do it.
[00:09:36.674 --> 00:09:37.214]  Watch.
[00:09:37.214 --> 00:09:38.815]  DJT is going to
[00:09:40.214 --> 00:09:45.395]  Focus and come out swinging and counterpunch like they've never seen.
[00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:59.299]  I can tell you right now that these globalists aren't going to fare too well when they pull this.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:03.460]  Great again!
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.341]  Target CEO raves about the economy.
[00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:06.522]  This is the best consumer environment I've ever seen.
[00:10:06.522 --> 00:10:07.563]  But that's a big liberal.
[00:10:07.563 --> 00:10:08.244]  Texas exports oil.
[00:10:31.243 --> 00:10:34.886]  Texas exports more oil than imports for the first time in U.S.
[00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:37.888]  history.
[00:10:37.888 --> 00:10:41.711]  Trump's tweet on South African land seizure draws ire.
[00:10:41.711 --> 00:10:53.719]  Ask Pompeo to study farm murders and the taking of land because other nations, other than Russia, won't take in the hundreds of thousands of begging farmers who are being slaughtered.
[00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:54.600]  That's all coming up.
[00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.841]  But then the big news.
[00:10:56.841 --> 00:11:11.353]  Paul Watson is going to be joining us at the bottom of the hour with some huge news on the massive Soros-funded, EU-controlled, UN-driven Islamic invasion of Europe and new shocking footage.
[00:11:11.353 --> 00:11:15.817]  In the next segment, I'm going to get into Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer.
[00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:31.771]  Had their own War Room YouTube, not set up by M4s, but set up by Owen a year ago to have their own channel, and it was given its third strike.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.283]  All of this has been completely made up for saying that they showed violence.
[00:11:38.283 --> 00:11:39.784]  I'm going to cover that in the next segment.
[00:11:39.784 --> 00:11:40.925]  And what was it?
[00:11:40.925 --> 00:11:45.128]  It was a black man beating a white man up for no reason and saying racial epithets.
[00:11:45.128 --> 00:11:46.969]  And it was a black teacher.
[00:11:46.969 --> 00:11:51.172]  And we're not going to show it because everybody else can.
[00:11:51.172 --> 00:11:51.972]  But we're not going to.
[00:11:51.972 --> 00:11:53.113]  We're going to play the little games.
[00:11:53.113 --> 00:11:56.075]  Everybody else can see it on Twitter, see it on Facebook, see it on YouTube.
[00:11:56.075 --> 00:12:01.559]  But we can't show the black lady hitting the white teenager in the head with a mop.
[00:12:01.559 --> 00:12:02.680]  Local news can show it.
[00:12:03.695 --> 00:12:07.318]  But let's see if they say that I'm the black lady beating the white student.
[00:12:07.318 --> 00:12:16.447]  Because, you know, they took me off YouTube saying I bullied a child, and Forbes and others said that I beat a child in Missouri.
[00:12:16.447 --> 00:12:26.396]  I mean, it was a guy with a beard like me, but it was on ABC News, CBS News, a month before they banned me, where it was that the kid was beating other people up.
[00:12:27.523 --> 00:12:30.146]  He was hitting the adult in the face, the adult pushed him down.
[00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:34.631]  They said that I, and people, I had family call, they said, you beat up a child?
[00:12:34.631 --> 00:12:36.754]  And I said, no, I didn't.
[00:12:36.754 --> 00:12:38.295]  So they'll probably, when this is in the news.
[00:12:39.304 --> 00:12:43.209]  Roger Stone and Owen Schroyer ban for beating up a child.
[00:12:43.209 --> 00:12:47.214]  And it's a, looks like about a 15, 16 year old white male.
[00:12:47.214 --> 00:12:57.287]  And the black adult woman hits him in the head in the classroom while he sits in his chair with a mop as black people dance around in circles, celebrating.
[00:12:58.203 --> 00:12:59.403]  We're not going to show it, though.
[00:12:59.403 --> 00:13:02.925]  And it'll probably be Jones or Roger Stone beat a child in the head with a mop.
[00:13:02.925 --> 00:13:05.125]  He beat a baby in the head with a mop.
[00:13:05.125 --> 00:13:07.826]  He took the baby out of an incubator and bashed its brains out.
[00:13:07.826 --> 00:13:09.887]  Then he, you know, he danced in their blood.
[00:13:09.887 --> 00:13:12.328]  I mean, this is what they do, folks.
[00:13:12.328 --> 00:13:12.888]  Did you hear?
[00:13:12.888 --> 00:13:15.669]  Yeah, I heard.
[00:13:15.669 --> 00:13:17.929]  Jones beat up another kid.
[00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:19.710]  Well, he got taken down.
[00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:22.771]  None of it has any reflection on reality.
[00:13:24.099 --> 00:13:27.500]  So I'm going to come back and show you the actual Google letters.
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:34.722]  And they even sent it to Owen's laptop, his private laptop, and said, you're now banned from Google services.
[00:13:34.722 --> 00:13:35.502]  This is a new thing.
[00:13:35.502 --> 00:13:37.022]  We've never seen this.
[00:13:37.022 --> 00:13:41.183]  So the new thing is banning you from the service with your web ID.
[00:13:41.183 --> 00:13:44.404]  And they're telling everybody with the new communist Chinese social score.
[00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:53.908]  You keep your mouth shut and you don't support Trump or you're not gonna get in college, you're not gonna get a job, you're not gonna have a LinkedIn account, you're not gonna have a bank account.
[00:13:53.908 --> 00:13:58.269]  It's happening to everyone.
[00:13:58.269 --> 00:13:59.949]  But don't worry, I forgot my folder.
[00:13:59.949 --> 00:14:01.569]  It's right by my office bathroom.
[00:14:01.569 --> 00:14:03.650]  I'm on the desk by the bathroom door.
[00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.050]  My green folder, you please bring it to me.
[00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.411]  If he doesn't already have it, it was produced yesterday.
[00:14:11.411 --> 00:14:13.932]  The president is about to get the action plan.
[00:14:15.529 --> 00:14:17.771]  And it's a 100% action plan.
[00:14:17.771 --> 00:14:20.313]  None of you will get out of any of this.
[00:14:20.313 --> 00:14:22.976]  So get ready for that.
[00:14:22.976 --> 00:14:25.618]  And I'm going to go ahead and read the action plan on air later.
[00:14:25.618 --> 00:14:28.361]  I'm going to post it to InfoWars.com.
[00:14:28.361 --> 00:14:36.488]  And let me tell you, I expect they'll probably launch a hack attack or something to try to shut us down today because of this info, but no one's going to stop this signal.
[00:14:36.488 --> 00:14:38.010]  I can get it directly to the President.
[00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:41.413]  I can get it directly to anybody I want in the government.
[00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:52.727]  When this goes out, it will immediately be at Army Special Operations Command, it'll be at SouthCom, CENTCOM, it'll directly be on all the computer screens of the officers in the military.
[00:14:52.727 --> 00:14:56.371]  And that's why you're really crapping your drawers now, aren't you?
[00:14:56.371 --> 00:14:58.113]  Yeah, you know.
[00:14:58.113 --> 00:14:59.395]  They know.
[00:14:59.395 --> 00:15:00.977]  So, good luck!
[00:15:02.205 --> 00:15:03.525]  Other people won't do the work.
[00:15:03.525 --> 00:15:04.346]  I'll do it.
[00:15:04.346 --> 00:15:05.586]  My lawyers will do it.
[00:15:05.586 --> 00:15:06.886]  Our researchers will do it.
[00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:08.147]  Our teams will do it.
[00:15:08.147 --> 00:15:09.967]  That's why we've been taken off the internet.
[00:15:09.967 --> 00:15:11.248]  That's why we're being demonized.
[00:15:11.248 --> 00:15:12.588]  That's why we're being lied about.
[00:15:12.588 --> 00:15:14.869]  That's why we're being attacked.
[00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:17.650]  Because we carry the light in the dark of the night.

[00:20:13.695 --> 00:20:19.281]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:20:19.281 --> 00:20:20.582]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:40.342 --> 00:20:45.084]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are getting a world exclusive right now.
[00:20:45.084 --> 00:20:56.367]  The Democratic Party, the Communist Chinese, the Deep State are all publicly trying to hack the 2018 midterm elections.
[00:20:56.367 --> 00:21:02.429]  They are purging thousands of prominent conservatives from Prager University to myself.
[00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:05.410]  They are shadow banning everybody, members of Congress.
[00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:06.870]  They're ratcheting them back 93% on average.
[00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:10.995]  Infowars is being totally banned.
[00:21:10.995 --> 00:21:17.381]  Democrat Senators are all over the news saying completely take me off of the Internet.
[00:21:17.381 --> 00:21:33.557]  Well, Owen Troyer and Roger Stone a year ago set up their own YouTube account separately on YouTube for the War Room that launched just about a year ago.
[00:21:35.043 --> 00:21:40.025]  Owen Schroyer posted the full video yesterday from his three-hour show in the War Room.
[00:21:40.025 --> 00:21:44.147]  Trump now toe-to-toe with the globalists in the fight for America.
[00:21:44.147 --> 00:21:46.828]  Full show.
[00:21:46.828 --> 00:21:53.431]  Now, they then say that we showed violence that's not authorized unless it's for documentary purposes.
[00:21:54.349 --> 00:21:58.611]  Just like they banned me off YouTube saying I bullied a kid and Forbes said I beat a child up.
[00:21:58.611 --> 00:21:59.511]  There was no child.
[00:21:59.511 --> 00:22:00.091]  I didn't beat him up.
[00:22:00.091 --> 00:22:03.833]  It was an ABC News clip of the kid in Missouri hitting the adult four times.
[00:22:03.833 --> 00:22:05.114]  The adult pushes him down.
[00:22:05.114 --> 00:22:06.574]  Everybody else could show it.
[00:22:06.574 --> 00:22:10.516]  They took it down so they could then lie about what... That's how the fraud works.
[00:22:10.516 --> 00:22:13.857]  They silence you to then frame you.
[00:22:13.857 --> 00:22:16.498]  And it's all directed by David Brock in Media Matters.
[00:22:16.498 --> 00:22:22.501]  He admits it all in his own admission in this restricted private confidential document that came out last year.
[00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:25.661]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:22:25.661 --> 00:22:28.363]  Show!
[00:22:28.363 --> 00:22:32.525]  Owen calls me this morning and he says, yeah, our videos have been taken down.
[00:22:32.525 --> 00:22:46.153]  Then he gets a message from YouTube saying, as you may know, our community guidelines describes what content we will allow and don't allow on YouTube, your video.
[00:22:47.386 --> 00:22:50.067]  Trump now toe-to-toe with the globalists in the fight for America.
[00:22:50.067 --> 00:22:50.467]  Full show.
[00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:51.807]  It was flagged for review.
[00:22:51.807 --> 00:22:54.648]  Upon review, we've determined that it violates our guidelines.
[00:22:54.648 --> 00:23:00.510]  We've removed it from YouTube and assigned a community guideline, strike your account, which banned the account.
[00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:06.731]  Now look, then we get this unable to access Google product when he came in here on his own laptop.
[00:23:06.731 --> 00:23:12.693]  It has a web ID and says, you're just banned from Google, period.
[00:23:12.693 --> 00:23:16.094]  Unpersonning the Chinese global social score.
[00:23:18.636 --> 00:23:20.378]  See that?
[00:23:20.378 --> 00:23:22.641]  By the way, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
[00:23:22.641 --> 00:23:28.048]  We have received over 3,000 emails from Google saying, reinstate your account.
[00:23:28.048 --> 00:23:29.170]  It was taken down in error.
[00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.872]  Reinstate your account.
[00:23:30.872 --> 00:23:32.694]  File a challenge to this.
[00:23:32.694 --> 00:23:34.677]  Because we didn't have any strikes.
[00:23:37.142 --> 00:23:38.963]  When they took down the Alex Jones Channel.
[00:23:38.963 --> 00:23:40.664]  And we have screenshots of all that.
[00:23:40.664 --> 00:23:44.607]  So it was done so high up that the automation's like, we believe this is an error.
[00:23:44.607 --> 00:23:46.488]  Please file a appeal.
[00:23:46.488 --> 00:23:48.169]  And it just keeps coming.
[00:23:48.169 --> 00:23:52.892]  We have that video actually in the computer if you guys want to roll the footage of just our account.
[00:23:52.892 --> 00:23:56.754]  And it's just every 10 minutes or so another one goes bloop bloop bloop bloop bloop.
[00:23:57.194 --> 00:23:59.995]  Over and over again, because they're not running it.
[00:23:59.995 --> 00:24:11.799]  Media Matters is in control, and Braggs, they're in the interface with the Southern Poverty Law Center, in the interface, filing their own public complaint, and having their people go in and delete us.
[00:24:11.799 --> 00:24:13.879]  Now, think I'm making that up?
[00:24:13.879 --> 00:24:14.440]  Here it is.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:16.900]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:24.703]  How Alex Jones... How Alex Jones is circumventing his Facebook ban.
[00:24:26.237 --> 00:24:32.261]  So this is them tattling to Facebook and tattling to YouTube.
[00:24:32.261 --> 00:24:35.383]  I'm literally walking through the studio, Rogers on.
[00:24:35.383 --> 00:24:41.146]  I go and make a joke about Bernie Sanders, and then they go, oh look, he's circumventing.
[00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:46.069]  No, Facebook said our four main pages are banned, not that I'm banned from the platform.
[00:24:46.069 --> 00:24:52.013]  But Media Matters spins it like Jones is banned, period, off Facebook and off of YouTube.
[00:24:54.497 --> 00:24:56.039]  You understand how that works?
[00:24:56.039 --> 00:24:58.281]  And so then they run around and tattle to Facebook.
[00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:00.703]  They haven't taken Owen's channel down yet.
[00:25:00.703 --> 00:25:05.148]  And they go and they tattle to YouTube saying, look, he's supposed to be unpersoned.
[00:25:05.148 --> 00:25:06.069]  And that's what they're saying.
[00:25:06.069 --> 00:25:07.911]  Jones isn't allowed to go on Joe Rogan's show.
[00:25:08.985 --> 00:25:11.726]  Alex Jones isn't allowed to go on any of your shows or you'll be banned.
[00:25:11.726 --> 00:25:14.848]  So they're now saying you don't have speech and I'm unperson.
[00:25:14.848 --> 00:25:18.290]  Even Charlie Manson would get to talk to the news if he wanted to.
[00:25:18.290 --> 00:25:25.994]  But they're saying, oh no, you can't hear what Jones is saying because they're going to tell people that I beat up kids in Forbes with no footage, no link.
[00:25:26.494 --> 00:25:30.097]  They're going to tell people that I'm a white supremacist all over the news.
[00:25:30.097 --> 00:25:33.719]  They're going to tell people things that aren't true and they don't want me responding.
[00:25:33.719 --> 00:25:36.882]  Just like when they said Trump hates all Mexicans but won't show the clip.
[00:25:36.882 --> 00:25:39.183]  They don't want him being able to respond to their liars.
[00:25:39.183 --> 00:25:44.767]  When you say you're a liar, they go, oh, you're attacking the press and going to cause violence.
[00:25:44.767 --> 00:25:47.209]  When I say Antifa, it says they're coming to your house to attack you.
[00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:51.791]  What do they say?
[00:25:51.791 --> 00:25:54.332]  Oh my God, Jones is going to attack the media with guns.
[00:25:54.332 --> 00:25:55.633]  Well, where's the clip?
[00:25:55.633 --> 00:25:57.153]  Doesn't exist.
[00:25:57.153 --> 00:25:58.374]  This is the fraud.
[00:25:58.374 --> 00:26:00.315]  So look.
[00:26:00.315 --> 00:26:03.336]  How Alex Jones is circumventing his Facebook ban.
[00:26:03.336 --> 00:26:05.277]  No, they took those pages down.
[00:26:05.277 --> 00:26:08.799]  And then it goes on to say he's on YouTube, he's on Facebook.
[00:26:08.799 --> 00:26:10.800]  And he's been taken down for bullying.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.081]  The same lie that I beat up a kid.
[00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:19.091]  And YouTube takes us down saying, yes, you've shown violence when we showed what's been on the national news.
[00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:22.212]  Black-on-white crime that's increasing because of the media.
[00:26:22.212 --> 00:26:27.012]  It goes on to say, I made an impersonation of Bernie Sanders.
[00:26:27.012 --> 00:26:37.994]  I continue to, by breaking news, in part by ranting about the supposed existence of gigantic left-wing pedophile conspiracy, my God, look at the news, and doing an extended impersonation of Bernie Sanders.
[00:26:37.994 --> 00:26:40.775]  But don't worry, they reported it and got it taken down.
[00:26:43.433 --> 00:26:44.453]  Do you understand?
[00:26:44.453 --> 00:26:48.515]  And then YouTube said, oh yes, thank you, George Soros.
[00:26:48.515 --> 00:26:49.375]  That's who funds it.
[00:26:49.375 --> 00:26:52.737]  Thank you, Nazi collaborator-funded organization.
[00:26:52.737 --> 00:26:54.117]  Thank you so much.
[00:26:54.117 --> 00:26:56.578]  Yes, yes, he's not supposed to be on YouTube anywhere.
[00:26:56.578 --> 00:26:59.600]  No, he's not allowed to be on Owen Schroyer's own YouTube channel.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:00.760]  We'll take him down right now.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.401]  We'll find wherever he is and take him down.
[00:27:02.401 --> 00:27:13.005]  And then they use the fake rule of, hey, they don't say Media Matters ordered you to be taken down, and they run the country, basically, and brag on their own documents that they are the interface and they're in people's private communications.
[00:27:13.005 --> 00:27:13.105]  No.
[00:27:16.018 --> 00:27:18.378]  They just say, oh, you violated our rules.
[00:27:18.378 --> 00:27:22.039]  You can show violence if it's for a documentary reason, and every other news channel can.
[00:27:22.039 --> 00:27:29.960]  But if you show black people beating up white people, yelling epithets, we're just going to say you violated our rules on violence, and we're going to take you down selectively.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:35.721]  Because Media Matters said so, and our executives have told us, you do what they say.
[00:27:35.721 --> 00:27:37.762]  And Google and Facebook and all of them brag.
[00:27:37.762 --> 00:27:40.902]  They're told what to do by Media Matters.
[00:27:40.902 --> 00:27:44.763]  And the mercenary, David Brock, who gets money from George Soros to run the whole thing.
[00:27:45.836 --> 00:27:47.338]  And it's all admitted.
[00:27:47.338 --> 00:27:54.687]  Now, if that isn't racketeering, if that isn't organized crime, if that isn't the Sherman Antitrust Act, nothing is.
[00:27:54.687 --> 00:27:58.091]  And I have top law firms ready to go with this with no payment.
[00:27:58.803 --> 00:27:59.403]  They're ready to go.
[00:27:59.403 --> 00:28:02.906]  And they're going to have class action suits against everybody.
[00:28:02.906 --> 00:28:04.867]  And I have it all right here in my hand.
[00:28:04.867 --> 00:28:08.489]  And this is now, now I've been told, has been delivered to the president.
[00:28:08.489 --> 00:28:10.550]  So the president now has this.
[00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:13.732]  And we've been requested to develop battle plans.
[00:28:13.732 --> 00:28:16.634]  And this is from a top law firm, top Republican law firm.
[00:28:16.634 --> 00:28:20.496]  And they say it is open and shut 100 percent.
[00:28:20.496 --> 00:28:22.377]  This isn't just uncivil.
[00:28:22.377 --> 00:28:23.978]  This is criminal.
[00:28:23.978 --> 00:28:25.059]  But here's the thing.
[00:28:25.059 --> 00:28:26.620]  They're making their move on President Trump.
[00:28:27.537 --> 00:28:28.178]  They don't care.
[00:28:28.178 --> 00:28:29.399]  This is their revolution.
[00:28:29.399 --> 00:28:32.761]  They think once they win the midterms, they're going to start impeachment, civil unrest.
[00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:33.242]  They don't care.
[00:28:33.242 --> 00:28:36.845]  So that's a concern to everybody that they are going this hardcore criminal.
[00:28:38.106 --> 00:28:49.695]  This lying about everybody, racketeering, organized crime, classic rackets behavior, in your private accounts, private groups, poring over what you do, misrepresenting it, getting you banned across all these platforms.
[00:28:49.695 --> 00:28:51.436]  This is illegal.
[00:28:51.436 --> 00:28:53.017]  Totally illegal.
[00:28:53.017 --> 00:28:56.700]  No one's ever done this before on an organized scale like this.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:57.641]  That's because they're going for broke.
[00:28:59.286 --> 00:29:01.968]  Listen to what Chris said about Andro 400.
[00:29:01.968 --> 00:29:04.910]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in 10 weeks.
[00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:09.633]  My son was getting married and when I went for the suit fitting, I was a size 48.
[00:29:09.633 --> 00:29:13.316]  And when I went back to do the final fitting, I was a 44.
[00:29:13.316 --> 00:29:15.257]  I have more energy, that's for sure.
[00:29:15.257 --> 00:29:17.819]  I probably lost 4 inches around my belly.
[00:29:17.819 --> 00:29:20.901]  I'm 57 and I'm fat when I was in my 30s.
[00:29:20.901 --> 00:29:22.543]  Here's what Dwayne said about Andro 400.
[00:29:23.303 --> 00:29:25.385]  This product really works.
[00:29:25.385 --> 00:29:27.307]  I'm an old guy and I don't trust nobody.
[00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:28.668]  I've tried all kinds of stuff.
[00:29:28.668 --> 00:29:31.551]  It's one of the few things I've ever bought that works.
[00:29:31.551 --> 00:29:32.351]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:29:32.351 --> 00:29:33.192]  I feel better.
[00:29:33.192 --> 00:29:34.293]  I have more energy.
[00:29:34.293 --> 00:29:35.514]  I walk 12 miles a day.
[00:29:35.514 --> 00:29:36.375]  I feel great.
[00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:37.436]  It changed my life.
[00:29:37.436 --> 00:29:38.197]  It really has.
[00:29:38.197 --> 00:29:39.277]  It's really incredible.

[00:30:13.424 --> 00:30:16.266]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever

[00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:10.785]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[00:31:10.785 --> 00:31:12.847]  That's why I'm introducing Z-SHIELD.
[00:31:12.847 --> 00:31:15.710]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:17.212]  It's made in the USA.
[00:31:17.212 --> 00:31:20.335]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are
[00:31:20.435 --> 00:31:24.018]  It's absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[00:31:24.018 --> 00:31:26.100]  It is a classical 360 win.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:35.808]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[00:31:35.808 --> 00:31:48.139]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be because we need you, the remnant of America,
[00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:52.625]  To reignite those brush fires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.

[00:33:03.362 --> 00:33:05.985]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.011 --> 00:33:14.455]  Another world.
[00:33:14.455 --> 00:33:15.797]  Another time.
[00:33:15.797 --> 00:33:17.579]  In the age of wonder.
[00:33:32.972 --> 00:33:35.934]  So, Media Matters, literally funded by George Soros,
[00:33:56.721 --> 00:34:08.124]  Braggs and Google, Facebook, they all admit that they run, along with the Southern Poverty Law Center, the interface in your private accounts, watching everything you're doing.
[00:34:08.124 --> 00:34:14.785]  Then they go out and flag it, and they have their own operatives delete your channels.
[00:34:14.785 --> 00:34:18.866]  And they're saying that they're going to delete Alex Jones.
[00:34:20.734 --> 00:34:24.818]  And delete channels of anybody that has Alex Jones on the channel.
[00:34:24.818 --> 00:34:27.180]  That is beyond a First Amendment violation.
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.081]  That is putting someone in exile.
[00:34:29.081 --> 00:34:31.743]  That is putting someone in the Phantom Zone.
[00:34:31.743 --> 00:34:35.166]  And it's telling everyone, you have no free speech.
[00:34:36.167 --> 00:34:38.789]  You're not allowed to talk to this person.
[00:34:38.789 --> 00:34:41.171]  You're not allowed to interview this person.
[00:34:41.171 --> 00:34:44.594]  Remember, Charlie Manson, Tim McVeigh could be interviewed.
[00:34:44.594 --> 00:34:47.456]  But they're saying you cannot talk to Alex Jones.
[00:34:47.456 --> 00:34:51.680]  And most people are saying, absolutely, we don't want free speech, we don't want America.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.023]  And then they go, good, we're going to take thousands more people off.
[00:34:55.023 --> 00:34:57.204]  They're like, it's okay, just leave us to last.
[00:34:57.204 --> 00:34:58.686]  This is all conditioning.
[00:34:58.686 --> 00:35:00.147]  This is all Pavlovian.
[00:35:00.147 --> 00:35:01.488]  This is all total control.
[00:35:01.488 --> 00:35:03.770]  And President Trump is beginning to take action.
[00:35:05.407 --> 00:35:08.448]  With suits over Facebook's discrimination and what Google's doing.
[00:35:08.448 --> 00:35:16.229]  They need to take action quickly because we're only 75 days out from the critical election and they're trying to steal the election right now.
[00:35:16.229 --> 00:35:26.632]  Paul Watson joins us from London, England on a big report he's got up on InfoWars.com dealing with the ongoing UN slash EU run program.
[00:35:27.765 --> 00:35:32.430]  With literally millions of North African and Islamic migrants from the Middle East coming in every year.
[00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:34.672]  And they're reporting everywhere, Paul, as you know.
[00:35:34.672 --> 00:35:40.838]  It's up on Infowars.com and Newswars.com, as well as Europe Wars, where we have reporters in Europe that...
[00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.033]  What's amazing about this is the numbers are worse than it was even a few years ago.
[00:35:46.033 --> 00:35:51.556]  This is an even bigger wave, but thank God some Eastern European countries are putting troops on their borders.
[00:35:51.556 --> 00:36:01.863]  Give us the latest on this in this shock footage that's on InfoWars.com of the acid attacks, of these intensifying situations, of the bomb rushing, of the guards.
[00:36:01.863 --> 00:36:02.544]  Tell us what's happening.
[00:36:03.717 --> 00:36:06.478]  Yeah, this is Ceuta in Spain.
[00:36:06.478 --> 00:36:07.699]  It's Spanish-owned territory.
[00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:10.600]  It's in Morocco, geographically, but it's Spanish-controlled.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:12.100]  They're crossing in from Morocco.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.261]  They're not Moroccan, obviously.
[00:36:13.261 --> 00:36:15.282]  You can see they're not Moroccan.
[00:36:15.282 --> 00:36:18.203]  Spanish police are warning that there are 50,000 of these migrants.
[00:36:18.203 --> 00:36:21.304]  They're all from African countries, mostly, waiting to cross in.
[00:36:22.225 --> 00:36:23.286]  This group went back.
[00:36:23.286 --> 00:36:24.106]  You've seen this video.
[00:36:24.106 --> 00:36:28.688]  Allegedly they were sent back, but hundreds more a few weeks before got into the country.
[00:36:28.688 --> 00:36:31.910]  We played that video before of them just roaming around the streets.
[00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:35.712]  So basically what happened is these European countries saw what was happening.
[00:36:35.712 --> 00:36:39.794]  They saw the rise in rapes, the rise in violent crime, the molestations, the terror.
[00:36:40.274 --> 00:36:41.556]  And they blocked off their borders.
[00:36:41.556 --> 00:36:44.020]  So a lot of these migrant routes were getting blocked off.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:51.952]  The route, the Mediterranean route, was getting blocked off because Salvini, the new Interior Minister of Italy, said, we're not going to accept anymore.
[00:36:51.952 --> 00:36:55.778]  So then the socialist government of Spain, which just got elected a couple months ago,
[00:36:56.781 --> 00:36:59.122]  Came out and said, we'll take him!
[00:36:59.122 --> 00:37:00.343]  We don't have enough crime.
[00:37:00.343 --> 00:37:02.364]  We don't have enough rapes on the streets.
[00:37:02.364 --> 00:37:04.786]  We don't have enough women afraid to go out at night.
[00:37:04.786 --> 00:37:05.886]  We'll take them all.
[00:37:05.886 --> 00:37:07.267]  And so that's what's happening.
[00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:12.110]  They've laid out the red carpet, incentivizing people risking their lives.
[00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.771]  That's what most people don't realize about this.
[00:37:13.771 --> 00:37:19.654]  When you incentivize people to risk their lives to make long journeys, you are putting their lives in danger.
[00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:21.835]  That's not a humanitarian thing to do.
[00:37:21.835 --> 00:37:23.136]  The number of sea deaths since
[00:37:23.756 --> 00:37:26.180]  The new Italian government got in as halved.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:32.949]  So half the amount of refugees are dying, but no, that's a bad thing apparently, according to the left.
[00:37:32.949 --> 00:37:39.157]  So this new Spanish government apparently is really eager to get the rape stats up.
[00:37:39.157 --> 00:37:41.180]  We just had new rape stats out of Sweden.
[00:37:42.832 --> 00:37:48.575]  Nearly 60% of those convicted of rape or attempted rape in Sweden are foreign born.
[00:37:48.575 --> 00:37:55.158]  And then when you look at the stats for rapists who the victim doesn't know the attacker in a rape situation,
[00:37:56.342 --> 00:37:58.663]  80% are foreign offenders.
[00:37:58.663 --> 00:38:05.924]  This is in Sweden, another country which opened its borders to mass migration and accelerated that process a few years ago.
[00:38:05.924 --> 00:38:08.284]  So apparently Spain wants a piece of that.
[00:38:08.284 --> 00:38:15.626]  They've rolled out the red carpet and that's why we see these videos of them just showing up on boats, as you see in this clip here, roaming onto the beach.
[00:38:15.626 --> 00:38:20.267]  You know, Spain had an ISIS terror attack just a year ago.
[00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:22.707]  There are plots that they're stopping all the time.
[00:38:23.405 --> 00:38:31.270]  How easy would it be for ISIS to just roll up on a beach like that and massacre a bunch of beachgoers given that they've got no security whatsoever.
[00:38:31.270 --> 00:38:34.852]  So basically this entire issue has been framed as a refugee crisis.
[00:38:34.852 --> 00:38:36.433]  It isn't a refugee crisis.
[00:38:36.433 --> 00:38:42.957]  A lot of the actual refugees are now going back to Syria because ISIS is being kicked out of different geographic areas.
[00:38:42.957 --> 00:38:44.518]  These are economic migrants.
[00:38:44.518 --> 00:38:49.020]  You see more smartphones in this video than you do women or children.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.842]  They're not refugees, they're economic migrants.
[00:38:52.402 --> 00:38:56.925]  And granted, if I was from some of the countries that they come from, I'd probably try to get into Spain.
[00:38:56.925 --> 00:39:04.109]  But if you import the third world, if you import Africa, you become Africa.
[00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:13.415]  And Paul, the UN admits it's all part of a major plan to bring in groups that don't assimilate, 80 plus percent stay on welfare, to be a client group that the socialist states control.
[00:39:15.282 --> 00:39:15.702]  Exactly.
[00:39:15.702 --> 00:39:24.489]  They had a UN projection from back in 2001 saying, oh, the US may be able to take in, I think it was 6 million migrants over a certain amount of time.
[00:39:24.489 --> 00:39:26.011]  They then claimed that was fake news.
[00:39:26.011 --> 00:39:30.034]  And because, oh, the UN didn't say that they were specifically going to do this.
[00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.195]  They just said it was a possibility.
[00:39:31.195 --> 00:39:34.718]  It was 600 million, Paul, directly from your report.
[00:39:34.718 --> 00:39:35.618]  600 million, sorry.
[00:39:35.618 --> 00:39:38.921]  And then Snopes said, well, they did say it, but they don't mean it.
[00:39:38.921 --> 00:39:39.862]  So that's why we're fake news.
[00:39:39.862 --> 00:39:40.522]  That's what Snopes does.
[00:39:40.522 --> 00:39:43.705]  They'll say the sky is not blue, but then later at the bottom, well, actually it is.
[00:39:44.554 --> 00:39:47.137]  And then they're the fact checkers for Facebook.
[00:39:47.137 --> 00:39:54.484]  I literally wrote an article during the election about, I forgot what the story was, but I provided a quote by this Hillary Clinton supporter.
[00:39:54.484 --> 00:39:59.689]  And then Snopes did an article on it saying, oh no, that was fake news because he didn't mean to say that.
[00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:04.834]  And then they invented a quote and attributed it to him so they could declare the story fake news.
[00:40:04.834 --> 00:40:06.776]  But that's aside from the point.
[00:40:06.776 --> 00:40:08.918]  Sweden again, as he mentioned, this plan.
[00:40:10.599 --> 00:40:18.064]  2% of Sweden's political leaders, political candidates, just 2% of them live in high migrant populated areas.
[00:40:18.064 --> 00:40:20.165]  So again, we come back to this every time.
[00:40:20.165 --> 00:40:24.549]  They push these policies because they don't bear the brunt of these policies.
[00:40:24.549 --> 00:40:33.575]  It's the working class people that bear the brunt of these policies, which is pretty ironic because they're always demonizing the working class in my country as being racist.
[00:40:33.575 --> 00:40:37.638]  These are the people, if you talk about white working class people, who live amongst
[00:40:55.911 --> 00:40:58.112]  Let's talk about this, Paul, since you mentioned it.
[00:40:58.112 --> 00:41:00.192]  Just two years ago they still denied no-go zones.
[00:41:00.192 --> 00:41:01.173]  Now it's all over the news.
[00:41:01.173 --> 00:41:02.893]  Sweden, France, Belgium.
[00:41:02.893 --> 00:41:04.013]  Huge no-go zones.
[00:41:04.013 --> 00:41:13.416]  The police, the letter carriers, food delivery trucks can't go in because everywhere they literally just get robbed, in many cases killed.
[00:41:13.416 --> 00:41:20.278]  Yeah, numerous, I think it was a couple of big postal companies in Sweden said they weren't going to deliver to certain areas.
[00:41:20.278 --> 00:41:22.799]  Rapes in Paris have gone up 20% in the first
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:30.345]  Five months, the last time they did the check, the first five months of 2018, rapes in Paris are up 20%.
[00:41:30.345 --> 00:41:36.550]  Remember back in 2015 after Charlie Hebdo, the mayor of Paris tried to sue Fox News.
[00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:42.676]  She eventually dropped it because they had a guest on who said that there were no go zones in Paris.
[00:41:42.676 --> 00:41:49.902]  Literally, they've got an area in Saint-Denis which has 300,000 illegal immigrants in one area of France.
[00:41:50.402 --> 00:41:51.763]  Women are harassed on the street.
[00:41:51.763 --> 00:41:53.905]  As I said, rapes are up 20%.
[00:41:53.905 --> 00:41:55.546]  Oh, but there are no no-go zones.
[00:41:55.546 --> 00:41:58.648]  Oh, you can go there, but you might get raped or violently attacked.
[00:41:58.648 --> 00:41:59.909]  But there are no no-go zones.
[00:41:59.909 --> 00:42:01.990]  That's the little trick they play.
[00:42:01.990 --> 00:42:04.912]  So yeah, we're facing the consequences of this.
[00:42:04.912 --> 00:42:08.334]  Certain countries have actually imposed proper border controls.
[00:42:08.334 --> 00:42:09.515]  Others haven't.
[00:42:09.515 --> 00:42:16.620]  And going forward, those are the ones who are going to experience the fallout from all this, as we're seeing in Germany, in France.
[00:42:17.079 --> 00:42:17.739]  That's right, Paul.
[00:42:17.739 --> 00:42:23.101]  We're going to break and you are going to punch out here to get some other big articles coming to Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:42:23.101 --> 00:42:34.805]  Just in 30 seconds, what do you make of them at Media Matters snapping their fingers and then taking other people's YouTube channels down where I was a guest for five minutes and made a joke about Bernie Sanders?
[00:42:36.294 --> 00:42:38.274]  Well, it's an abuse of terms of service.
[00:42:38.274 --> 00:42:43.276]  They should have their accounts cancelled if they're lobbying for this to happen, because that's brigading.
[00:42:43.276 --> 00:42:45.756]  It's an abuse of terms of service.
[00:42:45.756 --> 00:42:55.158]  So, people should report Media Matters and their accounts, because they're abusing the... But Media Matters also has their people working inside, so... Ha ha ha!
[00:42:55.158 --> 00:42:57.179]  This is not a fair system.
[00:42:57.179 --> 00:42:58.379]  Soros never does that.
[00:42:59.295 --> 00:43:00.636]  We knew it was coming.
[00:43:00.636 --> 00:43:02.077]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[00:43:02.077 --> 00:43:14.967]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[00:43:15.347 --> 00:43:26.397]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[00:43:26.397 --> 00:43:35.244]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show, subscribe to the free podcast, just click on the link, whatever you're subscribing to your podcast in, it'll pop up there.

[00:43:57.511 --> 00:43:58.792]  This is what they don't want you to see.

[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:21.186]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:21.186 --> 00:47:26.047]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:47:26.047 --> 00:47:27.588]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:47:31.184 --> 00:47:42.414]  I'm going to say, right now on air, the most important thing I've ever said on air since I started out 24 years ago.
[00:47:42.414 --> 00:47:44.416]  And it's this.
[00:47:44.416 --> 00:47:46.778]  This is a spiritual battle.
[00:47:46.778 --> 00:47:49.120]  You better get right with Jesus.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:53.704]  I wouldn't fear he who can kill the body, but he who can kill the soul.
[00:47:55.075 --> 00:48:00.920]  And, let me tell you, I've always believed in God, and I've had spiritual experiences, and there's a lot of mysteries in this world.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:03.702]  A lot of people know they have the sixth sense.
[00:48:03.702 --> 00:48:18.315]  There's a lot of mysteries in this universe, but studying the globalists, studying how they operate, studying their operations, you come to grips with the fact that they are absolutely committed to evil and doing bad things.
[00:48:18.315 --> 00:48:23.019]  That they are out to hurt the planet, hurt you, hurt God, and just commit evil acts.
[00:48:24.346 --> 00:48:26.807]  Now, that's the most important thing.
[00:48:26.807 --> 00:48:34.871]  But currently in the world events, and evil moving against humanity right now, it's this statement.
[00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:47.538]  The globalists, the big banks, the chi-coms, their army of radical Islam, the giant third world populations they now control, who they are using as unwitting pawns, as well as radical Islam,
[00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:52.373]  are moving against the West and are moving against you.
[00:48:52.373 --> 00:48:54.315]  You're having your free speech taken.
[00:48:54.315 --> 00:48:56.057]  You're having your birthright taken.
[00:48:56.057 --> 00:49:16.634]  They're attempting to set the president to de-platform you and un-person you in a science fiction level Chinese communist tested American and EU designed panopticonic social credit score system to be tied into every action you take in your entire life with
[00:49:17.793 --> 00:49:22.097]  The Alex's and the Google assistants listening and watching you.
[00:49:22.097 --> 00:49:23.898]  The cell phones watching and tracking you.
[00:49:23.898 --> 00:49:25.039]  It's all admitted.
[00:49:25.039 --> 00:49:26.140]  Congress is having hearings.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:29.083]  The Samsung TVs are watching and listening to you.
[00:49:29.083 --> 00:49:31.245]  Their own terms of service when you click it say it.
[00:49:31.245 --> 00:49:34.048]  It's a giant technological power grab.
[00:49:34.048 --> 00:49:40.453]  And they've been building up their armies of control against us for all these decades.
[00:49:40.453 --> 00:49:40.834]  And now
[00:49:42.301 --> 00:49:44.822]  They are moving against everybody.
[00:49:44.822 --> 00:49:47.202]  This is the big launch.
[00:49:47.202 --> 00:49:48.923]  This is the big attack.
[00:49:48.923 --> 00:49:51.224]  They are making their move on the West.
[00:49:51.224 --> 00:49:54.385]  Patriots in our government saw it, understood it, took action against it.
[00:49:54.385 --> 00:49:59.886]  Trump and other nationalist movements are a speed bump to this system.
[00:49:59.886 --> 00:50:06.088]  The globalists believe, we hope, a stopgap to have a real discussion about this and get humanity awake and thinking.
[00:50:08.018 --> 00:50:13.545]  Now I'm going to go to part of a very powerful Mark Dice report where he just lays out the arrogance of the situation.
[00:50:14.775 --> 00:50:18.736]  Then I'm going to have Owen Schroer in here later to actually talk about this report in full.
[00:50:18.736 --> 00:50:25.278]  But the arrogance of Brian Stelter, who literally has like 50 retweets, even though he has CNN and Twitter pushing him.
[00:50:25.278 --> 00:50:28.079]  And then Mark Dice has, you know, 10,000 on average.
[00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:32.200]  And then here's Brian Stelter wanting us all removed because of the competition.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:33.621]  It's so obvious.
[00:50:33.621 --> 00:50:34.561]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:50:34.561 --> 00:50:35.741]  It's so dirty.
[00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:36.741]  It's so villainous.
[00:50:36.741 --> 00:50:38.242]  But they're doing it.
[00:50:38.242 --> 00:50:40.943]  And if you accept it, you'll accept anything.
[00:50:40.943 --> 00:50:41.643]  Here's Mark Dice.
[00:50:45.017 --> 00:51:02.606]  The company is rethinking the core functions of the platform and he just sat down with CNN's little Brian Stoker to talk about some of the changes they're thinking about making because, well, the Trump train is just too popular and our messages and our activists are just resonating with too many people.
[00:51:02.606 --> 00:51:03.907]  Is your Twitter feed sick?
[00:51:04.807 --> 00:51:10.088]  These days, harassment, hate speech, and misinformation are poisoning social media.
[00:51:10.088 --> 00:51:13.049]  And Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey seems to know this.
[00:51:13.049 --> 00:51:15.510]  He's trying to cure Twitter of these ills.
[00:51:15.510 --> 00:51:17.050]  But how?
[00:51:17.050 --> 00:51:21.791]  At a rare interview at Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco, I asked him.
[00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:26.952]  We thought, you know, well, people are following you, so we should count them.
[00:51:26.952 --> 00:51:30.073]  And then we should put that count right on your profile page and
[00:51:30.988 --> 00:51:33.750]  Obviously people care about that, so we should make it big.
[00:51:33.750 --> 00:51:42.978]  But that one small choice, and it felt very small at the time and it felt obvious at the time, put an incentive to grow that number.
[00:51:42.978 --> 00:51:45.280]  Is that the right attention?
[00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:49.343]  So what they're saying is how you vote or how you write things or what you want is bad.
[00:51:49.343 --> 00:51:52.005]  So we're gonna get rid of that.
[00:51:52.005 --> 00:51:56.228]  Like they did for Sarah Silverman and all these failed shows that are on Netflix.
[00:51:56.228 --> 00:51:56.649]  They just
[00:51:58.126 --> 00:52:00.828]  Stop showing the stars.
[00:52:00.828 --> 00:52:05.111]  And then the next thing is they'll show fake stars and fake views.
[00:52:05.111 --> 00:52:06.612]  But that's not going to work.
[00:52:06.612 --> 00:52:12.796]  So, he then gets into Stelter has no numbers and Stelter's like... And by the way, those are Stelter's words.
[00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:19.301]  Mark Dice is just lip-syncing it in perfect real-time to add an extra little element of making a joke out of it.
[00:52:19.301 --> 00:52:19.581]  Here it is.
[00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:24.031]  I don't think it is today.
[00:52:24.031 --> 00:52:31.455]  I don't think it matters as much in context of how many conversations you have or how much you contribute back to the network.
[00:52:31.455 --> 00:52:35.297]  Let me just translate his mumbling for you in case you didn't quite understand it.
[00:52:35.297 --> 00:52:50.025]  I have about 330,000 Twitter followers because my commentary spread organically, naturally, through the platform because people liked it and people shared it and slowly but surely I amassed a pretty sizable following.
[00:52:50.325 --> 00:52:56.231]  But that shows that what I say people like and have a pretty powerful voice.
[00:52:56.231 --> 00:53:07.422]  And so they're considering hiding the number of followers that people have so that people can't judge how popular a certain account or certain person or personality is.
[00:53:08.403 --> 00:53:18.291]  As you know, not only does the number of total followers indicate, to some extent, how popular a certain account or person is, but also the engagement of their posts.
[00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:23.115]  How many likes, how many retweets, how many responses those tweets get.
[00:53:23.115 --> 00:53:31.462]  If you look at the feed of someone like CNN's Chris Cuomo, for example, who has a primetime show on the network, most of his tweets get between 100 and 300 likes.
[00:53:34.484 --> 00:53:36.726]  Just looking at a few recent random ones here.
[00:53:36.726 --> 00:53:39.088]  This one has 182 likes.
[00:53:39.088 --> 00:53:39.948]  Here's a couple more.
[00:53:39.948 --> 00:53:39.968]  279.
[00:53:39.968 --> 00:53:40.028]  136.
[00:53:40.028 --> 00:53:44.251]  You get the point.
[00:53:44.251 --> 00:53:49.876]  Let's compare that to a few of my most recent tweets, which I posted on my laptop here in my kitchen.
[00:53:49.876 --> 00:53:50.516]  Oh, wow!
[00:53:50.516 --> 00:53:51.217]  That one has 11,000 likes.
[00:53:51.217 --> 00:53:51.837]  This one, 1.4 thousand.
[00:53:51.837 --> 00:53:51.857]  2.8.
[00:53:51.857 --> 00:53:52.437]  14 thousand.
[00:53:52.437 --> 00:53:52.457]  4.5.
[00:53:52.457 --> 00:53:52.477]  1.2. 3.9.
[00:54:00.267 --> 00:54:07.893]  We're gonna come back with the rest of this that he did last week, I just saw it last night, with Owen Troyer when he's in studio.
[00:54:07.893 --> 00:54:10.995]  When we go to Brian Stelter's, he gets like five retweets, okay?
[00:54:10.995 --> 00:54:14.417]  This is like fully pushed on CNN, five retweets.
[00:54:14.417 --> 00:54:15.898]  They're over, they're done.
[00:54:15.898 --> 00:54:22.383]  Now they're just like a burning car that rebels roll down a hill into your house to burn it down.
[00:54:22.383 --> 00:54:25.886]  They just go around lobbying going, we're CNN, take Alex off!
[00:54:25.886 --> 00:54:27.226]  Google goes, yes, master.
[00:54:28.231 --> 00:54:32.252]  Stelter, actually on the video going, where are you going to get him off?
[00:54:32.252 --> 00:54:34.212]  When is Alex going to be gone?
[00:54:34.212 --> 00:54:36.233]  He's getting 10,000, 15,000 retweets.
[00:54:36.233 --> 00:54:37.553]  I get five!
[00:54:37.553 --> 00:54:40.073]  I want him off!
[00:54:40.073 --> 00:54:42.114]  These people are unbelievable.
[00:54:42.114 --> 00:54:44.474]  Look at the look in his eyes.
[00:54:44.474 --> 00:54:49.815]  A crazed, unpopular, lying demon.
[00:54:49.815 --> 00:54:52.356]  But now they're saying, we'll kick you off Twitter if you bully him.
[00:54:52.356 --> 00:54:57.317]  He's a public figure, a monster, lobbying to have me completely silenced.
[00:54:59.229 --> 00:55:04.851]  He's the tyrant, just like these big tech giants that are moved to China and are helping round people up.
[00:55:04.851 --> 00:55:11.952]  But they have senators going, well you saw what Alex Jones did to the Sandy Hook parents, and they say something I never said, never show what I said.
[00:55:11.952 --> 00:55:19.094]  All these warmongers, all the people supporting China, all the slave factories, but they can say, but Alex Jones is a bad man.
[00:55:19.094 --> 00:55:19.935]  Why, did you hear?
[00:55:19.935 --> 00:55:21.075]  He beat up a child.
[00:55:21.075 --> 00:55:22.235]  Where's the video?
[00:55:22.235 --> 00:55:23.656]  Well, he beat him up!
[00:55:23.656 --> 00:55:24.996]  That's why YouTube took him down!
[00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:28.930]  And again, you ask, we'll sue them.
[00:55:28.930 --> 00:55:30.512]  Folks, they're doing it to everybody.
[00:55:30.512 --> 00:55:32.994]  They're making a total criminal move.
[00:55:32.994 --> 00:55:34.676]  They've broken the social contract.
[00:55:34.676 --> 00:55:35.977]  They're going to steal the election.
[00:55:35.977 --> 00:55:38.679]  They're coming for your guns, your children, everything.
[00:55:38.679 --> 00:55:40.120]  They're not stopping.
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:41.442]  It's total criminal commitment.
[00:55:41.442 --> 00:55:43.303]  You understand?
[00:55:43.303 --> 00:55:44.324]  They know you woke up.
[00:55:44.324 --> 00:55:44.705]  They know.
[00:55:44.705 --> 00:55:47.067]  But this isn't like just two years ago.
[00:55:47.067 --> 00:55:48.968]  The enemy is now on the march against us.
[00:55:48.968 --> 00:55:50.089]  They're zombie-like.
[00:55:50.089 --> 00:55:51.050]  They're unpopular.
[00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:51.631]  They're stupid.
[00:55:51.631 --> 00:55:52.011]  They're weak.
[00:55:54.312 --> 00:56:00.659]  They have their system slave driving them and their identity is ruling your life because they know you're better than them.
[00:56:00.659 --> 00:56:01.599]  It's that simple.
[00:56:01.599 --> 00:56:03.221]  It's existential envy.
[00:56:03.221 --> 00:56:06.444]  That's why Stelter and all these guys want us off the air.
[00:56:07.841 --> 00:56:11.684]  You want to fund our operation and stop them from shutting us down and get great products at the same time?
[00:56:11.684 --> 00:56:13.285]  We were sold out of this for almost five months.
[00:56:13.285 --> 00:56:14.406]  Ultimate Bone Broth Formula.
[00:56:14.406 --> 00:56:17.528]  We've reformulated it with a new manufacturer, even better.
[00:56:17.528 --> 00:56:19.229]  You talk about what it's got in it.
[00:56:19.229 --> 00:56:20.010]  It's unbelievable.
[00:56:20.010 --> 00:56:21.511]  Chicken bone broth concentrated.
[00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:25.253]  So good for your bones, your tendons, just everything.
[00:56:25.253 --> 00:56:30.077]  Turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa, herb powder, and even more.
[00:56:30.077 --> 00:56:30.957]  Leading competitors are $60.
[00:56:30.957 --> 00:56:32.458]  They're not as strong.
[00:56:32.458 --> 00:56:33.679]  And they have a bunch of fillers in them.
[00:56:33.679 --> 00:56:34.920]  This has no fillers.
[00:56:34.920 --> 00:56:35.801]  It's incredibly strong.
[00:56:36.061 --> 00:56:42.725]  I'm selling it at $19.95 so that people have a try to see how amazing the results are when you're on it for a week or more.
[00:56:42.725 --> 00:56:46.548]  Mix it in with your smoothies, mix it in with your spirulina, mix it in with your whey.
[00:56:46.548 --> 00:56:47.369]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:54.471]  1995, I put in a super massive order for this baby.
[00:56:54.471 --> 00:56:56.051]  No reviews yet because it's a new formulation.
[00:56:56.051 --> 00:56:58.412]  The other one had five stars, thousands of them.
[00:56:58.412 --> 00:56:59.813]  And so this is the newest system.
[00:56:59.813 --> 00:57:01.613]  We're really, really proud of it.
[00:57:01.613 --> 00:57:02.794]  It's amazing.
[00:57:02.794 --> 00:57:10.456]  And it's available at InfoWarsStore.com or InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[00:57:10.456 --> 00:57:14.337]  We used to sell it for 50 bucks retail, discounted $30.
[00:57:14.337 --> 00:57:16.318]  It was a bestseller.
[00:57:16.318 --> 00:57:18.599]  But it's hard to produce, hard to acquire, hard to make.
[00:57:18.919 --> 00:57:20.400]  Because it's so concentrated.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.480]  So right now it's $19.95.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:22.940]  It's very close to cost.
[00:57:22.940 --> 00:57:24.941]  Introductory.
[00:57:24.941 --> 00:57:26.261]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:26.261 --> 00:57:28.842]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:57:28.842 --> 00:57:31.703]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:31.703 --> 00:57:33.504]  Ultimate Bone Broth.
[00:57:33.504 --> 00:57:35.285]  Primal Human Nutrition.

[00:57:38.125 --> 00:57:40.766]  Or 888-253-3139.
[00:57:40.766 --> 00:57:42.447]  We'll be back with hour number two.
[00:57:42.447 --> 00:57:44.228]  A ton of special guests and more.
[00:57:44.228 --> 00:57:46.108]  However you're listening, spread the word.
[00:57:46.108 --> 00:57:48.449]  It's all about fighting the censors and saving the republic.
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:55.682]  Choose to take control of your chemistry with Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium.
[00:57:55.682 --> 00:58:00.043]  This powerful combo is perfect for supporting your thyroid and health.
[00:58:00.043 --> 00:58:05.425]  BioTrue Selenium's formula is far from synthetic and is made from a source of 100% organic mustard seed.
[00:58:07.325 --> 00:58:15.971]  Our super high quality nascent iodine is an essential mineral sourced of 99.99% ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals.
[00:58:15.971 --> 00:58:23.737]  This essential mineral is necessary in order to produce thyroid hormones which influence every cell, tissue and organ in the body.
[00:58:23.737 --> 00:58:30.662]  With inadequate thyroid hormones you may experience slow metabolism, lethargy, weight gain and overall brain fog.
[00:58:31.022 --> 00:58:37.244]  Survival Shield X2 and BioTrue Selenium work together to support the systems in your body.

[00:58:50.353 --> 00:58:55.937]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products, we have it in four's life.
[00:58:55.937 --> 00:58:56.818]  It'd take hours.
[00:58:56.818 --> 00:58:59.260]  MycoZX Plus now has a lower price.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:00.421]  It's stronger.
[00:59:00.421 --> 00:59:02.042]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[00:59:02.042 --> 00:59:05.265]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[00:59:05.265 --> 00:59:06.386]  It's back in stock.
[00:59:06.386 --> 00:59:09.568]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[00:59:09.568 --> 00:59:12.891]  It's got the preglanone that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[00:59:13.331 --> 00:59:13.471]  Yeah.
[00:59:32.071 --> 00:59:34.053]  High quality silver and a lot more.
[00:59:34.053 --> 00:59:35.454]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[00:59:35.454 --> 00:59:43.280]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWorksStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:45.381]  And it's so essential to spread the word.
[00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:52.867]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[00:59:52.867 --> 00:59:55.549]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:14.582 --> 01:00:23.407]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones!
[01:00:27.051 --> 01:00:30.134]  All right, Owen Schroer is coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:30.134 --> 01:00:39.241]  He had his own YouTube channel and it just got deleted because Media Matters tattled on it and said, oh look, Alex Jones popped in for five minutes on his show.
[01:00:39.241 --> 01:00:41.663]  He's not allowed on YouTube.
[01:00:41.663 --> 01:00:42.644]  That's not what they said.
[01:00:42.644 --> 01:00:46.026]  They said those channels where I was established are taken down.
[01:00:46.026 --> 01:00:48.669]  You can't under federal or state law or anywhere else have a
[01:00:50.291 --> 01:00:56.473]  Media system or anything else where they say an individual is banned from a public commons like that.
[01:00:56.473 --> 01:01:00.475]  But that's the illusion they're trying to pitch with the global social score.
[01:01:00.475 --> 01:01:03.596]  But first let's go to this important report we call BS on Lester Holt.
[01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:11.213]  Twitter's CEO is standing by the company's decision to put InfoWars' Alex Jones on a seven-day suspension.
[01:01:11.213 --> 01:01:20.057]  This comes after Jones urged his Twitter followers to ready their battle rifles, as he put it, against the media in a video posted to the site.
[01:01:20.057 --> 01:01:28.800]  Alex Jones on Twitter posted this week what essentially is a video calling for people to get their battle rifles ready against the media.
[01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.701]  People need to have their battle rifles and everything ready at their bedsides.
[01:01:32.721 --> 01:01:33.762]  You gotta be ready.
[01:01:33.762 --> 01:01:36.503]  Saying it's time to act, it's gotta be done now.
[01:01:36.503 --> 01:01:38.684]  Move criminally against people.
[01:01:38.684 --> 01:01:47.207]  It's time politically, and economically, and judiciously, and legally, and criminally, to move against these people.
[01:01:47.207 --> 01:01:49.568]  It's got to be done now.
[01:01:49.568 --> 01:01:51.389]  I said a chill up my spine, how about yours?
[01:01:52.353 --> 01:02:04.980]  It did, I mean there's a number of actions that we believe help a call to incitement to violence and those are the things that we need to make sure that we're taking action on.
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:09.943]  Now is the time to act on the mainstream media and he says get the battle rifles ready.
[01:02:09.943 --> 01:02:10.544]  I didn't say that!
[01:02:11.224 --> 01:02:12.966]  That incites violence?
[01:02:12.966 --> 01:02:15.868]  Free speech does not protect inciting violence.
[01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:21.534]  This is an emergency message to President Trump, to Congress, and to anyone that supports free speech in this country.
[01:02:21.534 --> 01:02:30.061]  The Democratic Party is now calling for all Republicans, all patriots, including the President, to be de-platformed from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Apple, you name it.
[01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:32.263]  And Jones is hardly their only target, that's for sure.
[01:02:32.824 --> 01:02:37.845]  Every day the big tech companies censor someone else whose political opinions they disagree with.
[01:02:37.845 --> 01:02:44.987]  Facebook censored our free speech and shame on the ones that don't even see that we have been censored.
[01:02:44.987 --> 01:02:50.669]  This is a new super political class that operate as a judiciary.
[01:02:51.818 --> 01:02:56.603]  And as the police, and as the prison guards, to control our lives.
[01:02:56.603 --> 01:02:58.264]  This is classical authoritarianism.
[01:02:58.264 --> 01:03:03.789]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevent them from speaking.
[01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:06.551]  You've taken action against him in this instance.
[01:03:06.551 --> 01:03:07.152]  What is it?
[01:03:07.152 --> 01:03:08.353]  Can you tell us what it is?
[01:03:08.353 --> 01:03:10.475]  I believe we put him in a time out.
[01:03:10.555 --> 01:03:14.200]  Alex Jones is not an 8th grader who got busted smoking in the bathroom.
[01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:14.461]  Right.
[01:03:14.461 --> 01:03:15.442]  Like, it's just not.
[01:03:15.442 --> 01:03:25.958]  I mean, he's a guy who is, you know... Or someone who is... ...ruling outright conspiracy theories, and... It's actually an amazing... That will write the... This is what caused the ban, and not everything that Alex Jones has done before.
[01:03:26.178 --> 01:03:33.220]  Seems minor compared to the implications of someone suggesting a call to arms against a particular group, in this case, the media.
[01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.921]  I didn't say use weapons on the media.
[01:03:34.921 --> 01:03:36.441]  I don't want them to have weapons used on them.
[01:03:36.441 --> 01:03:37.402]  That'll make them victims.
[01:03:37.402 --> 01:03:40.043]  I'm worried they're going to false flag and stage something on themselves.
[01:03:40.043 --> 01:03:44.104]  And then they're going to send antifa out to all our houses, which they're doxing everybody saying they are.
[01:03:44.104 --> 01:03:47.025]  And I said defensively, be prepared to defend yourself.
[01:03:47.025 --> 01:03:49.346]  And they say that is inciting violence.
[01:03:49.346 --> 01:03:49.746]  No, it's not.
[01:03:49.966 --> 01:03:51.387]  Send a chill up my spine.
[01:03:51.387 --> 01:03:52.788]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:03:52.788 --> 01:03:56.210]  He said come with the battle rifles, engage in criminal activity.
[01:03:56.210 --> 01:04:00.592]  And I said use the judicial system legally and lawfully, and go after them criminally.
[01:04:00.592 --> 01:04:02.514]  They have got to get a lid on this.
[01:04:02.514 --> 01:04:07.417]  And the idea of martyrdom, it's also probably interesting, but it will be interesting to see who rallies around his cause.
[01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:07.837]  Let's remember,
[01:04:08.217 --> 01:04:09.698]  Donald Trump appeared on your show.
[01:04:09.698 --> 01:04:11.740]  President also entering the fray today.
[01:04:11.740 --> 01:04:21.509]  He said, quote, I won't mention names, but when they take certain people off of Twitter or Facebook and they're making that decision, that is really a dangerous thing because it could be you tomorrow.
[01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:22.931]  And we're also standing up.
[01:04:23.982 --> 01:04:26.725]  To social media censorship.
[01:04:26.725 --> 01:04:27.846]  That's the new thing.
[01:04:27.846 --> 01:04:33.451]  Trump's election and Alex Jones' popularity are merely symptoms of a corrupt and failed status quo.
[01:04:33.451 --> 01:04:34.972]  People know what's true.
[01:04:34.972 --> 01:04:36.213]  They can smell it.
[01:04:36.213 --> 01:04:37.814]  You can't stop them from knowing that.
[01:04:37.814 --> 01:04:39.936]  But this isn't about Alex Jones.
[01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:42.438]  This is about freedom.
[01:04:42.438 --> 01:04:45.599]  Mr. President, you don't want to look like you're after the press of the First Amendment.
[01:04:45.599 --> 01:04:48.100]  You're letting them butcher the press of the First Amendment.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:51.742]  Oh, but you don't want to look authoritarian and stand up to them.
[01:04:51.742 --> 01:04:53.003]  They're authoritarian.
[01:04:53.003 --> 01:04:54.243]  They're a clear and present danger.
[01:04:54.243 --> 01:04:55.204]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:04:55.204 --> 01:04:58.225]  Stay with us with more.
[01:04:58.225 --> 01:05:05.929]  Do you realize that when you spread the links from Infowars.com, when you spread the videos, you are changing the world?
[01:05:05.929 --> 01:05:06.409]  It's you.
[01:05:07.506 --> 01:05:10.009]  That's why you've been on the team supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[01:05:10.009 --> 01:05:11.370]  You are the info war.
[01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.294]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever.
[01:05:28.650 --> 01:05:40.039]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:05:40.039 --> 01:05:48.025]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:05:48.025 --> 01:05:55.070]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:05:55.070 --> 01:05:57.812]  We are the renaissance and we are winning!
[01:05:59.471 --> 01:06:06.695]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:06.695 --> 01:06:19.863]  There is an extremely powerful video that we posted to InfoWars.com and I'm going to upload it to Twitter in the next hour or so and it's what I really said on that banned
[01:06:21.351 --> 01:06:32.886]  Twitter video where Antifa said they were coming to people's houses to be violent and I said folks should be ready to defend themselves if they come to attack you like they did Congressman Scalise or like when they came and broke the ribs of Rand Paul.
[01:06:32.886 --> 01:06:34.989]  Everyone knows the last thing I want is violence.
[01:06:36.611 --> 01:06:44.438]  I'm worried that the media is hyping it up to stage events against themselves or provocateur it to then say that they've got to shut down the rest of the press.
[01:06:44.438 --> 01:06:49.623]  They're saying the president, when he counters their lies, is calling for violence against them and trying to shut down the press.
[01:06:49.623 --> 01:07:02.354]  When the fake corporate press, the New York Times, the Washington Post, CNN, MSNBC, Media Matters are all organized and deplatforming as flaggers on YouTube, on Facebook, on Google, on all of it.
[01:07:03.516 --> 01:07:08.678]  And so if they say the sky's red when it's blue, it's supposedly the truth, but it's all a fraud.
[01:07:08.678 --> 01:07:18.881]  When you see the young Turks, named after the genocidal organization that murdered a million and a half Christians in Turkey, literally, saying Alex Jones says, quote, attack the media.
[01:07:18.881 --> 01:07:19.901]  There's no video.
[01:07:19.901 --> 01:07:23.362]  There's no quote because it's a lie.
[01:07:23.362 --> 01:07:24.263]  Now they have U.S.
[01:07:24.263 --> 01:07:28.004]  senators all over the news, Democrats saying, take me off the air.
[01:07:28.004 --> 01:07:29.964]  I'm calling for violence, but they never show it.
[01:07:29.964 --> 01:07:31.565]  These people are liars.
[01:07:32.677 --> 01:07:33.818]  The video.
[01:07:33.818 --> 01:07:37.260]  We call BS Lester Holt caught in blatant lie by Alex Jones.
[01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:43.544]  And that's a powerful name, but we might just want to call it total proof the media is framing Alex Jones with violence.
[01:07:43.544 --> 01:07:50.568]  And then trying to have me silenced, trying to steal my First Amendment while they try to silence me.
[01:07:50.568 --> 01:07:54.391]  It's incredible.
[01:07:54.391 --> 01:07:55.692]  And folks, it gets even crazier.
[01:07:57.156 --> 01:08:03.301]  It's like that ABC News footage of the kid punching the adult in the face four times so he pushes him down.
[01:08:03.301 --> 01:08:09.165]  Forbes and others ran with it, that I beat up a kid and had been taken off the internet.
[01:08:09.165 --> 01:08:15.750]  And it's not true, but even when Forbes retracted it, they didn't care and I was removed.
[01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:18.812]  Folks, do you understand how dangerous this is?
[01:08:21.323 --> 01:08:26.025]  Well, just watch the video and make up your mind for yourself.
[01:08:26.025 --> 01:08:29.926]  And I've decided I'm going to re-upload to Infowars.com, because we actually have a copy of it.
[01:08:29.926 --> 01:08:31.187]  It's not even on the web now.
[01:08:31.187 --> 01:08:42.471]  That entire 25-minute message to the President, an emergency message to the President about how they're planting a false flag against the media to blame us, and how violence is not the answer, but that they're going to try to get violent.
[01:08:42.471 --> 01:08:45.972]  And it's such a powerful video, they went, what do we do?
[01:08:45.972 --> 01:08:46.712]  Well, we take this.
[01:08:46.712 --> 01:08:47.773]  And they've got lawyers that do this thing.
[01:08:49.206 --> 01:08:50.947]  He called for violence and put it out.
[01:08:50.947 --> 01:08:54.668]  Run it, say it, get him taken down.
[01:08:54.668 --> 01:08:56.149]  People say, well, go to court, fight him, sue him.
[01:08:56.149 --> 01:09:01.992]  Well, I've got the law firms set up and we've got the battle plans and later I'm going to go over this.
[01:09:01.992 --> 01:09:13.657]  Social media deplatforming, federal action, presidential commission, presidential executive orders.
[01:09:13.657 --> 01:09:16.398]  And the president is preparing orders.
[01:09:16.398 --> 01:09:18.599]  So I went and commissioned law firms.
[01:09:20.916 --> 01:09:22.916]  And we are just preparing all of this.
[01:09:22.916 --> 01:09:27.057]  We've already gotten one report to the President now.
[01:09:27.057 --> 01:09:36.079]  I know this has gotten into the hands of those that say it's getting to the President, so you may have already gotten it, but I'm going to make sure this goes up on the site today, so you can give it to all your members of Congress.
[01:09:36.079 --> 01:09:38.299]  I'm going to get it in a bunch of members of Congress' hands.
[01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:43.960]  I'm going to have couriers deliver it to every congressional office next week.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:48.461]  And so you're not going to shut me up, George Soros and David Brock and CNN.
[01:09:48.461 --> 01:09:49.561]  You're not shutting crap up.
[01:09:50.660 --> 01:09:52.921]  And you're not shutting the American people up.
[01:09:52.921 --> 01:09:59.905]  Guys, did you cue up the clip of Trump we played yesterday from Tuesday night where he talked about the deplatforming of InfoWars?
[01:09:59.905 --> 01:10:03.768]  And how it's not gonna be tolerated and how we have to accept everybody's voices and then figure it out for ourselves.
[01:10:03.768 --> 01:10:06.109]  We have that place?
[01:10:06.109 --> 01:10:07.850]  Here it is.
[01:10:07.850 --> 01:10:13.093]  And we're also standing up to social media censorship.
[01:10:13.093 --> 01:10:15.534]  That's the new thing.
[01:10:15.534 --> 01:10:16.415]  That's the new thing.
[01:10:17.588 --> 01:10:20.350]  You know, I'd rather have fake news like CNN.
[01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:33.339]  I would rather have fake news, it's true, than have anybody, including liberals, socialists, anything, than have anybody stopped and censored.
[01:10:33.339 --> 01:10:34.740]  We gotta live with it.
[01:10:34.740 --> 01:10:35.721]  We gotta get used to it.
[01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:36.782]  We gotta live with fake news.
[01:10:36.782 --> 01:10:38.343]  There's too many sources.
[01:10:38.343 --> 01:10:40.664]  Every one of us is sort of like a newspaper.
[01:10:40.664 --> 01:10:42.866]  You have Twitter, you have whatever you have, Facebook.
[01:10:44.076 --> 01:10:46.877]  But everyone, you can't have censorship.
[01:10:46.877 --> 01:10:50.459]  You can't pick one person and say, well, we don't like what he's been saying.
[01:10:50.459 --> 01:10:52.339]  He's out.
[01:10:52.339 --> 01:10:54.120]  So we'll live with fake news.
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:11:01.243]  I mean, I hate to say it, but we have no choice because that's by far the better alternative.
[01:11:01.243 --> 01:11:04.624]  You can't have people saying censorship because you know what?
[01:11:04.624 --> 01:11:05.385]  It can turn around.
[01:11:05.385 --> 01:11:07.566]  It could be them next.
[01:11:07.566 --> 01:11:08.346]  It could be them next.
[01:11:10.145 --> 01:11:11.086]  They're going for broke.
[01:11:11.086 --> 01:11:12.646]  Now, Owen Schroer joins us.
[01:11:12.646 --> 01:11:22.372]  We're going to get into this powerful Mark Dice video that illustrates how we all on Twitter and other places have hundreds of times the viewers and reach of a Brian Stelter or a Cuomo.
[01:11:22.372 --> 01:11:24.173]  And that's why they're begging to have it shut down.
[01:11:24.173 --> 01:11:26.315]  It's so outrageous.
[01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:29.276]  It'd be bad enough if they were number one and trying to crush some little guy.
[01:11:29.276 --> 01:11:31.197]  But it's just losers.
[01:11:31.197 --> 01:11:33.819]  And their ratings are down 24 points year after year.
[01:11:33.819 --> 01:11:36.841]  They have like 100,000 viewers on some of their larger shows.
[01:11:36.841 --> 01:11:38.742]  They are a total fraud.
[01:11:39.770 --> 01:11:41.693]  They're a total joke.
[01:11:41.693 --> 01:11:43.416]  And now, we're gonna be just tuned in.
[01:11:43.416 --> 01:11:46.882]  Here's Media Matters.
[01:11:46.882 --> 01:11:47.964]  We'll punch that article up.
[01:11:47.964 --> 01:11:48.465]  Here it is.
[01:11:48.465 --> 01:11:50.909]  How Alex Jones is circumventing his Facebook ban.
[01:11:50.909 --> 01:11:52.071]  And they said, and YouTube bans.
[01:11:52.071 --> 01:11:53.133]  They sent it to YouTube and said, look!
[01:11:54.522 --> 01:11:57.044]  He's on Owen Schroyer's show!
[01:11:57.044 --> 01:11:58.905]  He's not allowed to be on anybody's show.
[01:11:58.905 --> 01:12:00.546]  That's the unwritten thing they're putting out.
[01:12:00.546 --> 01:12:02.368]  That is serious racketeering.
[01:12:02.368 --> 01:12:03.609]  Totally illegal.
[01:12:03.609 --> 01:12:08.312]  And so, Facebook didn't bite on that, because Owen's got his own Facebook and stuff like that.
[01:12:08.312 --> 01:12:09.613]  He had it before he was even here.
[01:12:09.613 --> 01:12:11.835]  But his own YouTube channel that he had with Roger Stone...
[01:12:12.595 --> 01:12:18.259]  Now, and by the way, it wasn't like, oh, I need to get on Owen's show, and oh, that YouTube was so big.
[01:12:18.259 --> 01:12:19.660]  The average video probably has 5,000 views.
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.602]  I was walking through there and saw Roger on, and we had some fun.
[01:12:23.602 --> 01:12:25.443]  It was like, oh, let me get to an audience.
[01:12:25.443 --> 01:12:32.528]  I'm on over 200 radio stations, over 400 TV stations, over 100 cable systems, and growing 20, 30 stations a week, okay?
[01:12:32.528 --> 01:12:34.809]  I can go on as many radio shows as I want with a thumb.
[01:12:34.989 --> 01:12:38.611]  I mean, I can reach 10 million people like that all over the place.
[01:12:38.611 --> 01:12:40.212]  There's thousands of videos by them, full of words.
[01:12:40.212 --> 01:12:41.652]  It's blowing up in your face.
[01:12:41.652 --> 01:12:45.894]  So if you think that little YouTube channel, and I'm not mad that Owen had it, he had a couple.
[01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.195]  He said, can I do shows on my own?
[01:12:47.195 --> 01:12:48.255]  Can I do stuff from my house?
[01:12:48.255 --> 01:12:48.976]  I said, dude, I love it.
[01:12:48.976 --> 01:12:50.036]  Do all you want.
[01:12:50.036 --> 01:12:53.238]  So he still does shows himself from his apartment.
[01:12:53.238 --> 01:12:55.079]  When he got here like a couple of years ago, he said, can I keep?
[01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:56.099]  I said, of course you can.
[01:12:56.099 --> 01:12:58.961]  So the point is, is that they find where all our feeds go.
[01:12:58.961 --> 01:13:01.902]  And they go, oh, look, we found him again.
[01:13:01.902 --> 01:13:03.423]  Just five years ago, people would
[01:13:04.722 --> 01:13:08.607]  Absolutely flip out on anybody that called for censorship like this, but now they just do it.
[01:13:08.607 --> 01:13:10.550]  And who is Media Matters?
[01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:12.292]  George Soros!
[01:13:12.292 --> 01:13:18.119]  So, Owen joins us, so we got the notice, but they didn't say, oh, Media Matters says get rid of you.
[01:13:18.119 --> 01:13:19.681]  They said, oh, you showed violence.
[01:13:20.925 --> 01:13:22.265]  It's not in a documentary form.
[01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:23.446]  Well, we're the news.
[01:13:23.446 --> 01:13:24.946]  The news is allowed to show violence.
[01:13:24.946 --> 01:13:26.847]  We show stuff that's been on the news.
[01:13:26.847 --> 01:13:31.449]  But we're not going to show it here, just to really upset them, because they want to show it and take us off Twitter.
[01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:33.829]  Everybody else can show the black-on-white crime.
[01:13:33.829 --> 01:13:37.211]  Everybody else can show the South African farmers being killed.
[01:13:37.211 --> 01:13:38.751]  You know, just their dead bodies.
[01:13:38.751 --> 01:13:42.952]  But we're not allowed to because it's violence for violence's sake.
[01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:44.393]  That's right.
[01:13:44.393 --> 01:13:46.134]  So this is the selective enforcement.
[01:13:46.134 --> 01:13:47.094]  It was a bunch of that stuff.
[01:13:47.952 --> 01:13:50.773]  Well, it was probably going to happen eventually no matter what.
[01:13:50.773 --> 01:13:54.414]  I'm not sure exactly what they decided to strike us down for today.
[01:13:54.414 --> 01:13:55.795]  Was it showing the racial violence that is being
[01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:11.119]  I don't
[01:14:29.784 --> 01:14:33.186]  Get to other reaches of the internet now so more people are going to be awoke by it.
[01:14:33.186 --> 01:14:34.346]  But you know, it's funny.
[01:14:34.346 --> 01:14:38.228]  I was talking to John Harmon today and he was just like, hey, you know, how you doing?
[01:14:38.228 --> 01:14:40.449]  I was like, oh, you know, just getting personal threats.
[01:14:40.449 --> 01:14:41.450]  My family's getting threats.
[01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:42.890]  Just got banned off YouTube.
[01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:44.911]  Just a regular day in the info war.
[01:14:44.911 --> 01:14:56.377]  And then you have the mainstream media like Brian Stelter go and whine and complain about how they're victims of Trump and they're victims of violence when nobody's nobody's doing any violence against them.
[01:14:57.518 --> 01:15:04.784]  You don't have 600 documented cases of Bernie supporters or Hillary supporters being harassed and assaulted in the streets of America.
[01:15:04.784 --> 01:15:07.627]  You do have that for Trump supporters, but the media is not going to cover that.
[01:15:07.627 --> 01:15:11.331]  So, they're just trying to spin off everything now, Alex.
[01:15:11.331 --> 01:15:14.654]  Yeah, they're censoring us, so they say we're censoring them.
[01:15:14.654 --> 01:15:16.916]  They're calling for violence on us, so they say it on them.
[01:15:16.916 --> 01:15:20.559]  I can't believe they say I called for battle rifles on the media.
[01:15:20.559 --> 01:15:21.080]  Never said it.
[01:15:23.038 --> 01:15:28.905]  So you had Boston Globe report a bomb threat last week, which the FBI did not validate.
[01:15:28.905 --> 01:15:36.714]  And then you had Ken Vogel of the New York Times put some weird voicemail that he got that he said was a threat to him, which I'm doubting that too.
[01:15:36.714 --> 01:15:37.695]  Sorry, Ken.
[01:15:37.695 --> 01:15:40.238]  Seems a little strange that all of a sudden you're threatening voicemails.
[01:15:40.738 --> 01:15:41.519]  They are committed to life.
[01:15:41.519 --> 01:15:42.380]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:47.425]  Yeah, suddenly the week they say hundreds of editorials, Trump's going to be violent to us, suddenly they get all these threats.
[01:15:47.425 --> 01:15:48.046]  Absolutely.
[01:15:48.046 --> 01:15:49.668]  I believe they're doing it all to themselves.
[01:15:49.668 --> 01:15:52.871]  They are sick and evil anti-American scum.
[01:15:52.871 --> 01:15:53.852]  Try to bring this country down.
[01:15:53.852 --> 01:15:54.353]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:57.222 --> 01:16:01.988]  If you like alkaline water, or know someone that does, you're going to love the Dillon Living Water Bottle.

[01:17:27.213 --> 01:17:28.434]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:17:28.434 --> 01:17:32.355]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:32.355 --> 01:17:33.896]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:17:33.896 --> 01:17:36.857]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:36.857 --> 01:17:42.419]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:42.419 --> 01:17:43.620]  I can help you, too.
[01:17:43.620 --> 01:17:46.561]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.782]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:48.782 --> 01:17:53.224]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX, or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[01:18:02.248 --> 01:18:07.972]  Years ago, InfoWarsLife created the powerful MycoZX formula to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:18:07.972 --> 01:18:15.838]  As the years went on, and more toxins were pumped into the environment, our team knew we had to create a bigger and better formula to help support your gut health.
[01:18:15.838 --> 01:18:19.001]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search for that formula.
[01:18:19.181 --> 01:18:24.443]  A unique natural formula designed to support the body's natural cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:18:24.443 --> 01:18:27.224]  There's no better product to help your body fight back.
[01:18:27.224 --> 01:18:36.228]  MycoZX Plus helps support a healthy microbial balance in the body, supports your digestive tract, and addresses the intestinal yeast that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:18:36.288 --> 01:18:42.513]  It's powered by an impressive list of ingredients, including grapefruit seed extract, paldarco bark, and grapeseed extract.
[01:18:42.513 --> 01:18:48.238]  Our formula is fueled by ingredients that stood the test of time as powerful micro-balancing properties.

[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:55.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:15.568 --> 01:20:23.051]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you're listening to the most banned, most censored, most demonized, most hunted, most persecuted broadcast in the world.
[01:20:23.051 --> 01:20:27.453]  The Democratic Party, the big corporations, no, no one wants to watch them.
[01:20:27.453 --> 01:20:28.193]  No one.
[01:20:28.193 --> 01:20:31.434]  CNN has the lowest ratings of anything on cable.
[01:20:31.434 --> 01:20:34.135]  Their average show looks at 100,000 viewers.
[01:20:34.135 --> 01:20:35.456]  So how are they going to respond?
[01:20:37.677 --> 01:20:38.978]  How are they going to do it?
[01:20:38.978 --> 01:20:50.806]  They are going to go out with Media Matters, the Democratic Party, and go around and bully the internet to take everyone off air, to set the precedent that anybody popular, from Paul Joseph Watson to Joe Rogan to PewDiePie, will be taken off.
[01:20:50.806 --> 01:20:56.710]  And people that don't stand up against this, and who go along with it, well they will end up getting shut down.
[01:20:56.710 --> 01:21:05.637]  So I salute PewDiePie, I salute Matt Drudge, I salute all the other great folks that have been out there telling the truth, Tucker Carlson, they get what's happening.
[01:21:06.414 --> 01:21:08.156]  This is classic authoritarianism.
[01:21:08.156 --> 01:21:09.437]  Bill Maher gets it.
[01:21:09.437 --> 01:21:12.541]  He at least gets that.
[01:21:12.541 --> 01:21:13.382]  But now here we are.
[01:21:13.382 --> 01:21:15.604]  Owen Schroer, I want to play part of this Mark Dice report.
[01:21:15.604 --> 01:21:23.432]  We were talking about this this morning, about how here he is, stulture, with his average tweet, maybe getting 15, 20, 30, 100 retweets.
[01:21:23.432 --> 01:21:24.594]  I mean, it's joke level.
[01:21:24.594 --> 01:21:26.616]  He's pushed everywhere in the New York Times.
[01:21:26.616 --> 01:21:27.677]  He's pushed everywhere on CNN.
[01:21:28.769 --> 01:21:30.869]  And then there he is, begging.
[01:21:30.869 --> 01:21:38.571]  I mean, it's really what he said, but Mark Dice voiced over it to make it even more, you know, crispy the clown, or chuckles the clown sounding.
[01:21:38.571 --> 01:21:46.053]  And it's just so hilarious, except the big corporations that are working together have said, hey, this guy says take you off, you're off the air.
[01:21:46.053 --> 01:21:54.354]  This self-appointed, self-annoying little monster is the epitome of anti-American danger.
[01:21:54.354 --> 01:21:56.435]  So let's go ahead and roll some of Mark Dice talking about him.
[01:21:57.270 --> 01:22:08.633]  If you look at the feed of someone like CNN's Chris Cuomo, for example, who has a primetime show on the network, most of his tweets get between 100 and 300 likes.
[01:22:08.633 --> 01:22:11.574]  Just looking at a few recent random ones here, this one has 182 likes.
[01:22:11.574 --> 01:22:13.435]  Here's a couple more, 279, 136, you get the point.
[01:22:18.396 --> 01:22:24.001]  Let's compare that to a few of my most recent tweets, which I posted on my laptop here in my kitchen.
[01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:25.342]  Oh wow, that one has 11,000 likes!
[01:22:25.342 --> 01:22:27.584]  This one 1.4 thousand, 2.8, 14 thousand, 4.5, 1.2, 3.9, you get the point.
[01:22:35.171 --> 01:22:39.033]  So nobody cares what CNN's Chris Cuomo is tweeting about.
[01:22:39.033 --> 01:22:42.595]  And fewer people care what little Brian Stelter is tweeting.
[01:22:42.595 --> 01:22:47.537]  Here he just sent his brand new newsletters out and 15 people liked it.
[01:22:47.537 --> 01:22:49.098]  Here's a clip from his show yesterday.
[01:22:49.098 --> 01:22:51.059]  130 likes.
[01:22:51.059 --> 01:22:53.320]  Another tweet from him, 168 likes.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:54.361]  You get the point.
[01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:55.781]  We're crushing them.
[01:22:55.781 --> 01:22:58.523]  Which is why Jack Dorsey admitted in his interview with Brian
[01:22:58.843 --> 01:23:04.226]  That they're considering hiding the follower counts and even removing the like button!
[01:23:04.226 --> 01:23:11.030]  What is the timeline for re-examining how you show follower counts or the use of the like button?
[01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:14.212]  You know, we're, I mean, we're looking and thinking about all these things right now.
[01:23:14.212 --> 01:23:18.094]  We've, we've, um, we've definitely had conversations about them.
[01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:22.017]  But would you say, like, by the end of the year, there's going to be those fundamental changes to Twitter?
[01:23:22.017 --> 01:23:23.618]  I don't, uh, I...
[01:23:24.557 --> 01:23:30.182]  I worry about a time frame like that because we also need to take into consideration we're a small company.
[01:23:30.182 --> 01:23:31.163]  A small company!
[01:23:31.163 --> 01:23:37.609]  Hey Jack, that's funny because Forbes has your personal net worth at over 5 billion dollars!
[01:23:37.609 --> 01:23:50.340]  Do you guys remember about 10 years ago when a bunch of celebrities like Ashton Kutcher, Oprah Winfrey, Britney Spears and others were making headlines because they were having a contest to see who could get to a million Twitter followers first?
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:55.663]  It's not that Twitter was this organically amazing new social media service.
[01:23:55.663 --> 01:24:05.650]  Its popularity was astroturfed and funded by big money in Silicon Valley to make it one of the mainstream social media services.
[01:24:05.650 --> 01:24:15.297]  And now because ordinary people like you and me have been dominating on these platforms and crushing the mainstream media, they're scrambling to try to shut us down.
[01:24:16.701 --> 01:24:20.864]  Go to MarkDice.com to find more of his great commentary, work, books, t-shirts, you name it.
[01:24:20.864 --> 01:24:22.706]  But that's, it's all right there.
[01:24:22.706 --> 01:24:27.049]  And then imagine, you're already prisoners in these boxes that are there to psychologically control you.
[01:24:27.049 --> 01:24:29.811]  And these social media networks, they admit they're meant to capture you.
[01:24:29.811 --> 01:24:31.392]  They had Sean Parker go public about it.
[01:24:31.392 --> 01:24:32.813]  They say it's very immoral.
[01:24:32.813 --> 01:24:33.834]  It brain damages people.
[01:24:33.834 --> 01:24:34.995]  That's in all the studies.
[01:24:34.995 --> 01:24:37.097]  But now you're in a prison without even buttons.
[01:24:37.097 --> 01:24:44.022]  You can't even Pavlovianly say, I like this, I don't like that, I want to... No, it's like, you will get this!
[01:24:44.022 --> 01:24:46.324]  You will get Brian Stelter and like it!
[01:24:47.446 --> 01:24:49.487]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:24:49.487 --> 01:24:50.868]  Owen, wow.
[01:24:50.868 --> 01:24:55.730]  And then to have these very people be the judge, jury, and executioner, lobbying everywhere!
[01:24:55.730 --> 01:24:56.891]  Hey, listen!
[01:24:56.891 --> 01:25:00.653]  It'd be like if I wanted to be in the NFL and I weighed 100 pounds and I was a meth head!
[01:25:00.653 --> 01:25:05.576]  And I showed up at the, let's say, the New England Patriots tryouts, and I said, no!
[01:25:05.576 --> 01:25:06.936]  Don't let that 280-pound all-star
[01:25:08.257 --> 01:25:10.558]  He's a linebacker who's got three Super Bowl wins!
[01:25:10.558 --> 01:25:11.298]  Try it out!
[01:25:11.298 --> 01:25:12.399]  That's not fair!
[01:25:12.399 --> 01:25:13.559]  He's a racist!
[01:25:13.559 --> 01:25:15.360]  I'm gonna be your linebacker!
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:16.621]  Or your quarterback!
[01:25:16.621 --> 01:25:18.221]  I'm gonna be a lineman!
[01:25:18.221 --> 01:25:22.183]  And I can't hardly walk, but it's okay!
[01:25:22.183 --> 01:25:25.545]  Because I get them off the field!
[01:25:25.545 --> 01:25:29.006]  No one watches my show, but I want everyone else taken down!
[01:25:29.006 --> 01:25:30.687]  And I said so!
[01:25:30.687 --> 01:25:32.948]  Owen, this is pretty pathetic, isn't it?
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:43.466]  Well, it is that old school yard dynamic where the big loser on the field at recess or practice, you know, takes their ball and goes home or just quits because they can't win.
[01:25:43.466 --> 01:25:44.787]  But he's trying to take our ball!
[01:25:44.787 --> 01:25:45.647]  Our ball and go home!
[01:25:45.647 --> 01:25:46.248]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:46.248 --> 01:25:54.854]  They'll take everyone's ball and they'll tear up your field too and call it their own while they're pissing on it and, you know, all the other stuff that they do on it.
[01:25:54.854 --> 01:25:56.595]  But, you know, let's stay in that same vein, Alex.
[01:25:56.595 --> 01:25:59.577]  You know, when you hired me, which was just over two years ago,
[01:26:00.237 --> 01:26:04.039]  I came out of a professional in the sports media, okay?
[01:26:04.039 --> 01:26:25.411]  So, just, just, if you want to see how pathetic and failing mainstream news really is, just, just look at where I've come from in two years in professional political media, where now, Alex, if I go on YouTube, and this is probably another reason why they wanted to ban the War Room Show, we, if we upload the War Room, the full War Room Show to YouTube now, last night, within an hour, it had 5,000 views.
[01:26:25.411 --> 01:26:25.971]  Within an hour.
[01:26:28.973 --> 01:26:33.895]  On the Alex Jones Channel, you had over 300 million views.
[01:26:33.895 --> 01:26:36.177]  You had videos with 25 million views.
[01:26:36.177 --> 01:26:37.817]  30 million views on Facebook.
[01:26:37.817 --> 01:26:39.778]  They already deleted all those before they banned us.
[01:26:39.778 --> 01:26:40.519]  So they fear you!
[01:26:41.991 --> 01:26:52.936]  But look, that's what I'm saying, is somebody like Mark Dyson, he always references this, can sit in his kitchen and have more power than Brian Stelter, who sits at a multi-million dollar studio with multi-million dollar ad deals.
[01:26:52.936 --> 01:26:56.037]  This was you and Roger Stone made this a separate account.
[01:26:56.037 --> 01:27:01.759]  So this is your account, because I came on for five minutes, it's banned, because Media Matters tattled and went, look!
[01:27:01.759 --> 01:27:02.480]  He's on there!
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:05.741]  Our Nazi collaborator, Oder, wants him off the air!
[01:27:05.741 --> 01:27:07.302]  So we want him off!
[01:27:09.551 --> 01:27:13.613]  I want you to finish the segment in shelter voice, please.
[01:27:13.613 --> 01:27:15.013]  I've actually had Brian on.
[01:27:15.013 --> 01:27:17.634]  Can we get Brian back up here, guys?
[01:27:17.634 --> 01:27:20.675]  No, I don't go on the Alex Jones Show anymore.
[01:27:20.675 --> 01:27:23.677]  Last time I went on the Alex Jones Show, I was ridiculed.
[01:27:23.677 --> 01:27:26.398]  I was called Pennywise.
[01:27:26.398 --> 01:27:31.520]  My stature and size and shiny chrome dome was all insulted.
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:35.221]  And so I'm not going back on the Alex Jones Show, but I will tell you this.
[01:27:35.221 --> 01:27:37.142]  You're the subway guy, which I do!
[01:27:39.537 --> 01:27:44.699]  I will tell you that they tried to cast me for Pennywise in the latest film, It.
[01:27:44.699 --> 01:27:45.700]  Steven Spielberg's It.
[01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.101]  They tried to cast me for Pennywise.
[01:27:48.101 --> 01:27:48.901]  I wouldn't need any makeup.
[01:27:48.901 --> 01:27:49.861]  I couldn't.
[01:27:49.861 --> 01:27:50.802]  Can I babysit your children?
[01:27:50.802 --> 01:27:51.742]  I couldn't do Pennywise, though.
[01:27:51.742 --> 01:27:53.703]  Would you trust me with your children?
[01:27:53.703 --> 01:27:54.303]  What?
[01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:55.184]  You don't trust me?
[01:27:55.184 --> 01:27:56.624]  Why does no one watch me?
[01:27:56.624 --> 01:27:57.425]  You don't like me?
[01:27:57.425 --> 01:27:59.125]  The executives like me.
[01:27:59.125 --> 01:28:01.706]  I'm like them.
[01:28:01.706 --> 01:28:02.987]  You're gonna float in the end, Alex.
[01:28:04.673 --> 01:28:05.574]  You're gonna float in the air!
[01:28:05.574 --> 01:28:07.196]  You're gonna get shadowbanned!
[01:28:07.196 --> 01:28:09.858]  And when it's all over, only I'm gonna be on the air!
[01:28:09.858 --> 01:28:12.081]  I don't have time!
[01:28:12.081 --> 01:28:14.183]  I don't have time, okay?
[01:28:14.183 --> 01:28:19.888]  I don't have time to be Pennywise because I'm too busy making sure that people like Alex Jones are deplatformed!
[01:28:20.589 --> 01:28:21.950]  That's my job now!
[01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:23.771]  I have no time to sleep!
[01:28:23.771 --> 01:28:25.912]  Because all I do is try to control everything!
[01:28:25.912 --> 01:28:27.793]  Because no one likes me!
[01:28:27.793 --> 01:28:29.174]  Why don't they like me?
[01:28:29.174 --> 01:28:30.134]  I hate America!
[01:28:30.134 --> 01:28:32.396]  And I want to take your guns!
[01:28:32.396 --> 01:28:34.897]  And I want to babysit your kids!
[01:28:34.897 --> 01:28:36.318]  And ahhh!
[01:28:36.318 --> 01:28:38.099]  Help me run things!
[01:28:38.099 --> 01:28:39.880]  It's okay, hold on!
[01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.641]  We're going to have the two Brian Stelters!
[01:28:42.461 --> 01:28:48.105]  When we come back to interview John McAfee, we'll be right back with Owen Schroyer.
[01:28:48.105 --> 01:28:53.648]  I'm Ryan Stelter reporting from the control-free Communist News Network.
[01:28:53.648 --> 01:28:58.311]  Don't criticize me or I'll have you banned!
[01:28:58.311 --> 01:29:00.052]  Let's talk tough.
[01:29:00.052 --> 01:29:01.453]  Let's talk comfort.
[01:29:01.453 --> 01:29:03.834]  Let's talk about down-home value.
[01:29:03.834 --> 01:29:08.797]  Made in the USA blue jeans, like you wore as a kid.
[01:29:08.797 --> 01:29:09.678]  Remember?
[01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:11.138]  There's a place down in Tennessee
[01:29:13.687 --> 01:29:20.812]  Well, they make blue diamond gussied jeans They sew pride in every stitch

[01:33:30.492 --> 01:33:32.333]  Hi everybody!
[01:33:32.333 --> 01:33:38.114]  I'm Brian Stelter and I decide who and who can't go on
[01:33:39.059 --> 01:33:41.119]  The internet now, is that clear?
[01:33:41.119 --> 01:33:46.060]  I just got Owen Schreier taken off his YouTube channel.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:53.982]  And the good folks at Media Matters, funded by George Soros, they've been going around saying no one can have Alex Jones on now.
[01:33:53.982 --> 01:33:56.762]  That's not authoritarian at all!
[01:33:56.762 --> 01:33:59.403]  Mark Dice was pointing out that I only get a few retweets.
[01:33:59.403 --> 01:34:01.863]  He gets tens of thousands and so does Alex Jones.
[01:34:01.863 --> 01:34:04.364]  And Owen Schreier, that's why he needs to be taken down!
[01:34:05.851 --> 01:34:13.737]  And I agree, I'm actually, well I'm actually Owen Schroyer who got in a time machine and came back as Brian Stelter.
[01:34:13.737 --> 01:34:18.500]  I'm not Anton LaVey and I'm not Leo Zagami, no.
[01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:19.701]  Everything's fine.
[01:34:19.701 --> 01:34:25.466]  Actually I am Anton LaVey from heaven and I was broadcasting down here but I still lie a little bit.
[01:34:25.466 --> 01:34:27.747]  Let's actually go to the real Brian Stelter.
[01:34:27.747 --> 01:34:29.088]  Can we put him back on screen?
[01:34:29.088 --> 01:34:31.830]  And then I guess let Owen Schroyer talk to him.
[01:34:31.830 --> 01:34:32.871]  Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:34:34.352 --> 01:34:39.322]  Oh, and go ahead and be Mr. Stelter now.
[01:34:39.322 --> 01:34:40.845]  Well, I just wanted to ask Brian a question.
[01:34:40.845 --> 01:34:43.430]  Brian, why do you want to get InfoWars banned so much?
[01:34:44.258 --> 01:34:59.328]  Well, you see, it's not fair that someone like Alex Jones, who is much better looking than me, has a family that loves him, has a whole crew of people that loves him, has friends that care about him, has an audience that will always support him.
[01:34:59.328 --> 01:35:11.156]  It's not fair that Alex Jones gets to exist and compete with someone like me, who's ugly, not just physically, but also mentally and spiritually hideous.
[01:35:11.156 --> 01:35:13.898]  And a lot of people say I remind them of Pennywise Stelter.
[01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:16.119]  But, who's my uncle?
[01:35:16.119 --> 01:35:24.181]  But, I just think it's not fair that Alex Jones is allowed to have a platform and then I'm supposed to compete with that?
[01:35:24.181 --> 01:35:27.642]  So you have to be banned, Owen, and you're next too!
[01:35:27.642 --> 01:35:38.326]  You gotta be banned, and David Knight, and if you guys, and Roger Stone, and Mark Dice, and anyone else who's obviously much better looking than me, has a much higher IQ, they must be banned.
[01:35:38.326 --> 01:35:39.366]  This is not fair.
[01:35:39.366 --> 01:35:40.347]  I am a journalist.
[01:35:40.347 --> 01:35:41.227]  I am a newsman.
[01:35:41.847 --> 01:35:43.528]  I am a newsman, dammit!
[01:35:43.528 --> 01:35:48.532]  And by the way, don't criticize me or I'll file a bullying complaint.
[01:35:48.532 --> 01:35:53.495]  I'm only trying to smother your speech and defaming you and lying and saying you're calling for violence.
[01:35:53.495 --> 01:35:58.919]  I'm only engaged in all sorts of horrible things and working with, you know, media matters to bad people.
[01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:00.740]  So you have to lay down to me.
[01:36:00.740 --> 01:36:03.582]  I deserve, as Legacy Media, to make you watch me.
[01:36:03.582 --> 01:36:04.763]  And it's going to happen.
[01:36:06.349 --> 01:36:14.076]  Oh, you know what's so great about this moment right now, Alex, is that Brian Stelter is actually probably listening and crying.
[01:36:14.076 --> 01:36:16.298]  Well, look- We should call him Cryin' Stelter!
[01:36:17.398 --> 01:36:24.563]  Well, the bottom line is this guy has absolutely raped our free speech along with the rest of CNN and that fellow he works with over there at Media Matters.
[01:36:24.563 --> 01:36:25.463]  And this is dangerous.
[01:36:25.463 --> 01:36:27.805]  And the President's going to take action.
[01:36:27.805 --> 01:36:34.789]  And to ride shotgun with us, I want to bring John McAfee, famous computer programmer and inventor of McAfee software, worked at NASA before that.
[01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:38.331]  And he joins us and he's put some tweets out and pointed out this really is a
[01:36:39.332 --> 01:36:40.852]  Conspiracy against my free speech.
[01:36:40.852 --> 01:36:48.975]  And top law firms, I've talked to like, well, four different ones, and I've got some ready to sue, you know, antitrust for free.
[01:36:48.975 --> 01:36:52.556]  I've got others who've written reports to the President that we're getting to the President.
[01:36:52.556 --> 01:36:54.496]  Social media deplatforming.
[01:36:54.496 --> 01:36:56.137]  The federal action that's being prepared.
[01:36:57.137 --> 01:37:03.662]  And of course, expanding on that, we've got the Presidential Commission and all the things, the executive orders that are being prepared.
[01:37:03.662 --> 01:37:06.544]  But we're 75 days out from this, John McAfee.
[01:37:06.544 --> 01:37:11.428]  I mean, this is the stuff you read about in history books in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia, in my view.
[01:37:11.428 --> 01:37:13.490]  I mean, is this not the big move?
[01:37:13.490 --> 01:37:15.171]  But they're not even just saying, I'm de-platformed now.
[01:37:15.171 --> 01:37:17.853]  They're saying, don't have Jones on or we'll de-platform you.
[01:37:17.853 --> 01:37:19.595]  I mean, this is the unpersonning.
[01:37:19.595 --> 01:37:22.757]  This is the Chinese global social score they now admit is coming here.
[01:37:22.757 --> 01:37:23.878]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:37:25.839 --> 01:37:28.841]  Well, you know, first of all, Alex, I like your beard.
[01:37:28.841 --> 01:37:30.882]  I didn't even know you had one.
[01:37:30.882 --> 01:37:36.406]  But on one of the prior shows that I did with you, I pointed out that this was likely to happen.
[01:37:36.406 --> 01:37:43.330]  That the social media companies would end up being the conservators of truth, as they define it.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:46.941]  And be the mass censors.
[01:37:46.941 --> 01:37:48.061]  But here's the issue.
[01:37:48.061 --> 01:37:57.223]  If somebody says, Chinese fairies have flown into the ears of all the congressmen, and they're now controlling them, how the hell do you know that's not true?
[01:37:57.223 --> 01:38:00.264]  Please God, who's gonna say that's absolutely not true?
[01:38:00.264 --> 01:38:03.185]  I've seen stranger things.
[01:38:03.185 --> 01:38:04.125]  So I stood up for you.
[01:38:04.125 --> 01:38:09.466]  I lost, by the way, 15,000 followers for standing up for you.
[01:38:09.466 --> 01:38:11.067]  But I do stand up for my friends, Alex.
[01:38:11.941 --> 01:38:14.525]  Well, you were standing up for yourself, too.
[01:38:14.525 --> 01:38:16.288]  Oh, I do stand up for me, I promise you that.
[01:38:16.288 --> 01:38:20.614]  But I'm saying if we don't all stand together on the First Amendment, even Bill Maher's got that right, we're going to lose everything.
[01:38:22.174 --> 01:38:23.075]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:38:23.075 --> 01:38:23.935]  Absolutely.
[01:38:23.935 --> 01:38:25.876]  And again, I warned about this.
[01:38:25.876 --> 01:38:27.177]  I've warned lots of people.
[01:38:27.177 --> 01:38:38.663]  Trust me, social media platforms are going to be the censors, the definers of truth, and what's acceptable for us to look at, listen to, and read.
[01:38:38.663 --> 01:38:39.764]  It's insane.
[01:38:39.764 --> 01:38:43.366]  They admit that it's the social engineering arms, and Jack Dorsey admits that.
[01:38:43.366 --> 01:38:48.268]  He goes, we believe our social engineering will make Alex Jones behave and stop saying, kill people.
[01:38:48.268 --> 01:38:49.609]  But I didn't say that.
[01:38:49.609 --> 01:38:51.310]  So like, they even based it on a lie.
[01:38:54.532 --> 01:38:56.617]  Well, nothing's going to make you behave, nor me, Alex.
[01:38:56.617 --> 01:38:58.741]  I know that for a fact.
[01:38:58.741 --> 01:39:00.725]  But listen, we do have to stand together.
[01:39:00.725 --> 01:39:02.308]  You know, I have a suggestion for you.
[01:39:02.308 --> 01:39:04.112]  If you want to stick it to the man.
[01:39:05.093 --> 01:39:09.377]  Why don't you start your own cryptocurrency, the Alex Jones Coin.
[01:39:09.377 --> 01:39:10.678]  You have a radical following.
[01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:13.560]  I promise you, every one of your followers are going to buy it.
[01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:17.903]  And start your own financial system within America.
[01:39:17.903 --> 01:39:18.584]  Stick it to the network.
[01:39:18.584 --> 01:39:19.104]  Well, I'll tell you this.
[01:39:19.104 --> 01:39:22.627]  I've stayed out of the cryptocurrencies because I didn't want to bet on the wrong thing or tell people to.
[01:39:22.627 --> 01:39:27.030]  But now, they've succeeded in becoming the new dominant thing out there.
[01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:28.872]  This has really got to freak the globalists out.
[01:39:30.290 --> 01:39:31.751]  Well, yeah, and it should.
[01:39:31.751 --> 01:39:33.553]  The banks, the Fed.
[01:39:33.553 --> 01:39:40.919]  And how are governments going to collect taxes if you can't tell what a person's income was, what they spent, what they received.
[01:39:40.919 --> 01:39:44.842]  And with cryptocurrency, especially the privacy coins, the government cannot.
[01:39:44.842 --> 01:39:46.664]  We'll talk about that some in the next segment.
[01:39:47.744 --> 01:39:50.206]  But let me just get to this and I'm sure he's riding shotgun with us.
[01:39:50.206 --> 01:39:54.188]  Why do you think they're accelerating it all now because it seems like a big risky thing?
[01:39:54.188 --> 01:39:56.290]  The president says he's going to take action against it.
[01:39:56.290 --> 01:39:58.051]  How do you think the president should take action against it?
[01:39:58.051 --> 01:39:59.732]  Because I'm not bragging.
[01:39:59.732 --> 01:40:03.614]  We are going, we've already gotten things into his hands as the media now knows with horror.
[01:40:03.614 --> 01:40:08.517]  I'm not going to get into the details of that, but he is absolutely now receiving our research.
[01:40:08.517 --> 01:40:11.820]  We have top law firms getting him information.
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:15.402]  So, I mean, what do you as a smart guy think we should do?
[01:40:17.358 --> 01:40:19.320]  Well, here's the issue.
[01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:23.084]  People are sensing that Trump is weakening, which is absolutely not true.
[01:40:23.084 --> 01:40:27.308]  I've never seen a stronger president.
[01:40:27.308 --> 01:40:38.279]  And they're taking every opportunity to diss what they view is the Trump policies, the Trump beliefs, the right wing, conservativism, the whole thing.
[01:40:39.043 --> 01:40:46.509]  And I think by making an example of you, and they'll get around to making an example of me.
[01:40:46.509 --> 01:40:49.291]  I'm no less vocal than you, I just have fewer followers.
[01:40:49.291 --> 01:40:53.194]  You know, I have 800,000 to worry about.
[01:40:53.194 --> 01:40:55.416]  And they'll get around to everybody.
[01:40:55.416 --> 01:41:04.783]  That does not conform to the political correct view of what life is, what our government is, and how happy we all are.
[01:41:06.437 --> 01:41:08.958]  I tell you though, it's a bold move for them to launch this.
[01:41:08.958 --> 01:41:10.219]  Why do you think they picked me first?
[01:41:10.219 --> 01:41:11.800]  I think it's because they demonized me first.
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:15.042]  They thought I could misrepresent what I said and done, but I think it's blown up in their face.
[01:41:15.042 --> 01:41:18.163]  And I'm not just saying that to put perfume or lipstick on a pig.
[01:41:18.163 --> 01:41:27.629]  I mean, ten times the traffic, five times people recognize me in the street, support flooding in, though the enemy attacks are intensifying, so support is more critical than ever.
[01:41:27.629 --> 01:41:29.910]  I mean, what do you think they're going to do next?
[01:41:31.175 --> 01:41:32.816]  Well, you asked why they picked you.
[01:41:32.816 --> 01:41:34.237]  Jesus, Alex, you know why.
[01:41:34.237 --> 01:41:38.640]  You are the most in-your-face commentator in America, thank God.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.421]  You know, you don't back down.
[01:41:40.421 --> 01:41:42.202]  You tell things as you see it.
[01:41:42.202 --> 01:41:44.663]  You don't give a shit what people think about what you said.
[01:41:44.663 --> 01:41:47.145]  And people hate that.
[01:41:47.145 --> 01:41:55.810]  You are the epitome of everything that the left-wing Clinton culture hates about America.
[01:41:56.716 --> 01:42:01.101]  And oddly enough, you do have a mixed bag of followers.
[01:42:01.101 --> 01:42:03.604]  People either hate you or they love you, Alex.
[01:42:03.604 --> 01:42:04.705]  Same with me.
[01:42:04.705 --> 01:42:07.088]  Except more people hate me, I think.
[01:42:07.088 --> 01:42:08.169]  But yeah, of course you.
[01:42:08.169 --> 01:42:09.191]  Who else?
[01:42:09.191 --> 01:42:15.818]  You are the one person in America who goes out and says, here it is, in your effing face.
[01:42:15.818 --> 01:42:16.199]  Here it is.
[01:42:17.620 --> 01:42:18.141]  Of course you do.
[01:42:30.435 --> 01:42:32.936]  But man, it is now, what, the biggest thing in the world?
[01:42:32.936 --> 01:42:34.497]  And they say, oh, it's just all digital.
[01:42:34.497 --> 01:42:35.977]  Well, their stuff's all digital.
[01:42:35.977 --> 01:42:38.138]  So how do you think this shakes out as well?
[01:42:38.138 --> 01:42:49.803]  And then we have, coming up later in the next hour, Pastor Rodney Howard, who's formerly from South Africa, to talk about the mass extermination of whites and our liberal media telling Trump, hey, let the whites stay there and be killed.
[01:42:49.803 --> 01:42:50.703]  They deserve it.
[01:42:50.703 --> 01:42:52.304]  Whites deserve to die.
[01:42:52.304 --> 01:42:53.444]  That's liberal, didn't you know?
[01:42:53.444 --> 01:42:54.545]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:54.545 --> 01:42:54.885]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.078 --> 01:43:02.781]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:43:57.145 --> 01:43:58.506]  We knew it was coming.
[01:43:58.506 --> 01:43:59.946]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[01:43:59.946 --> 01:44:13.211]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[01:44:13.211 --> 01:44:24.255]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten news feeds.
[01:44:24.255 --> 01:44:25.156]  Go to InfoWars.com
[01:44:26.016 --> 01:44:26.676]  We're good to go.
[01:44:55.384 --> 01:44:58.065]  This is what they don't want you to see!
[01:44:58.065 --> 01:45:02.167]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[01:45:02.167 --> 01:45:09.249]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.

[01:46:55.242 --> 01:47:01.245]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[01:47:01.245 --> 01:47:03.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:12.785 --> 01:47:15.566]  Bernie Sanders here, back live.
[01:47:15.566 --> 01:47:19.367]  As I told you, white people don't know what it's like to be poor.
[01:47:19.367 --> 01:47:24.208]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:47:24.208 --> 01:47:30.049]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.049 --> 01:47:37.531]  Yes, white people don't know what it's like to be poor, and Molly Tibbetts doesn't know what it's like when an illegal alien kills her.
[01:47:38.371 --> 01:47:39.852]  You think, oh, well, that's a sick joke.
[01:47:39.852 --> 01:47:41.434]  No, it's not a sick joke.
[01:47:41.434 --> 01:47:46.938]  You've got Pocahontas, you've got MSNBC hosts saying, oh, big deal, this lady isn't important.
[01:47:46.938 --> 01:47:51.402]  So she got kidnapped, tortured and, you know, raped and murdered.
[01:47:51.402 --> 01:47:56.226]  The real things, the children and being separated from their parents, it's all made up.
[01:47:56.226 --> 01:47:58.348]  It's been going on for 50 years.
[01:47:58.348 --> 01:48:00.090]  The little girl didn't get separated from her mother.
[01:48:01.698 --> 01:48:02.779]  But here's what they hate.
[01:48:02.779 --> 01:48:10.948]  CNN says it's racist to show the illegal alien, but we'll show it, being led in handcuffs in after killing the woman.
[01:48:10.948 --> 01:48:12.650]  So it's totally sick.
[01:48:14.980 --> 01:48:20.822]  Now, John McAfee is our guest here, riding shotgun some of the next hour, covering the waterfront.
[01:48:20.822 --> 01:48:32.426]  I wanted to play a clip here of the President yesterday, and get his take on this, pointing out that the reason they want to impeach him, and the reason they're pushing all this, is because he's popular, the country's coming back somewhat, and they want to change the subject of that.
[01:48:32.426 --> 01:48:32.926]  And I agree.
[01:48:32.926 --> 01:48:38.688]  And then he said, he thinks, this morning on Fox & Friends, that if they were able to remove him, it'd probably tank the economy.
[01:48:38.688 --> 01:48:40.409]  We're getting some of the best numbers ever seen.
[01:48:41.704 --> 01:48:46.267]  I want to get his take A on what the president said and B on what he thinks will happen to the economy.
[01:48:46.267 --> 01:48:54.812]  If they try to take him out and what type of backlash that'll stir in the American people because this is confirmed from Jack Posobiec now what Stone got from high level sources.
[01:48:54.812 --> 01:48:58.954]  They're preparing to indict Donald Trump Jr.
[01:48:58.954 --> 01:49:02.136]  So let's go ahead and go to that clip of El Presidente.
[01:49:02.136 --> 01:49:04.958]  I guess it says something like high crimes and all.
[01:49:04.958 --> 01:49:08.500]  I don't know how you can impeach somebody who's done a great job.
[01:49:09.938 --> 01:49:14.101]  I'll tell you what, if I ever got impeached, I think the market would crash.
[01:49:14.101 --> 01:49:17.603]  I think everybody would be very poor.
[01:49:17.603 --> 01:49:22.447]  And then there's some other clubs where he points out, when he was in another rally, what's unfolding there.
[01:49:22.447 --> 01:49:26.429]  So John McAbee, what do you think of that?
[01:49:26.429 --> 01:49:30.892]  Well, absolutely, the market would crash.
[01:49:30.892 --> 01:49:34.635]  We would be in a world of hurt, because if he's impeached, what comes next?
[01:49:35.499 --> 01:49:39.000]  Um, people dislike Trump because he is successful.
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:41.981]  He does not bow down to convention.
[01:49:41.981 --> 01:49:45.382]  He doesn't listen to anybody's advice except his own.
[01:49:45.382 --> 01:49:51.884]  In other words, he is his own man with his own self-confidence and he acts on it.
[01:49:51.884 --> 01:49:53.265]  People hate that.
[01:49:53.265 --> 01:49:56.486]  People hate confident, successful people.
[01:49:56.486 --> 01:50:00.987]  And Trump is the epitome of a confident, successful person.
[01:50:00.987 --> 01:50:02.807]  Now, they're not going to impeach him.
[01:50:02.807 --> 01:50:04.208]  It can't possibly succeed.
[01:50:05.903 --> 01:50:10.585]  And pray to God we get some sanity back in this country.
[01:50:10.585 --> 01:50:16.587]  I mean, if you look at our social media, for example, they say, well, we're private companies.
[01:50:16.587 --> 01:50:19.829]  You avoided our policies.
[01:50:19.829 --> 01:50:22.810]  Aren't there things called monopolies anymore?
[01:50:22.810 --> 01:50:29.112]  I mean, is not, you know, YouTube sort of a monopoly?
[01:50:29.112 --> 01:50:33.914]  Is not Facebook the monopoly of tweets, of short messages?
[01:50:33.914 --> 01:50:34.334]  Please, God.
[01:50:35.060 --> 01:50:36.240]  I mean, let's get real here.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:46.944]  They do have an obligation to not just their users, but to the country, to our culture, to try to toe the line of balance.
[01:50:46.944 --> 01:50:47.884]  And that's not happening.
[01:50:47.884 --> 01:50:49.945]  So they're not going to succeed.
[01:50:49.945 --> 01:50:51.105]  They're not going to succeed.
[01:50:51.105 --> 01:50:53.426]  And I have full confidence in Trump.
[01:50:53.426 --> 01:50:57.307]  Number one, he's much smarter than people gave him credit for.
[01:50:57.307 --> 01:50:58.728]  He's more devious, thank God.
[01:51:00.143 --> 01:51:04.666]  And he's a very experienced person in negotiating and business and finance.
[01:51:04.666 --> 01:51:06.086]  This is exactly what we need.
[01:51:06.086 --> 01:51:09.048]  I agree with you.
[01:51:09.048 --> 01:51:10.429]  Adding this point.
[01:51:11.380 --> 01:51:14.363]  We've had top law firms look at this, but the companies have argued this themselves.
[01:51:14.363 --> 01:51:17.265]  On the left is all of the news saying, these are the electronic commons.
[01:51:17.265 --> 01:51:19.407]  We must shut Jones down from the commons.
[01:51:19.407 --> 01:51:20.308]  He's too dangerous.
[01:51:20.308 --> 01:51:24.051]  Not because I'm a bad person, but because it's too popular, as Tucker Carlson said.
[01:51:24.051 --> 01:51:25.812]  But coming up next hour, I want to go over this with you some.
[01:51:25.812 --> 01:51:27.193]  This is from a top law firm.
[01:51:27.193 --> 01:51:29.215]  We'll be announcing some things very, very soon.
[01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:35.901]  But social media deplatforming, federal action laid out to the president, and there's larger indexes that are going to be going to the president.
[01:51:37.231 --> 01:51:41.072]  Presidential Commission, executive orders, the ways to take action.
[01:51:41.072 --> 01:51:44.892]  It's all right here in these reports.
[01:51:44.892 --> 01:51:48.733]  So I'm going to be going over all of this more with you some of the next hour.
[01:51:48.733 --> 01:51:51.474]  Plus, you've been a top executive and a businessman, a smart guy.
[01:51:51.474 --> 01:51:52.894]  You can give us some of your angles and takes.
[01:51:52.894 --> 01:51:54.554]  But John McAfee's here, obviously.
[01:51:54.554 --> 01:51:59.415]  Owen Schroer, you just got deplatformed off your own YouTube channel because I came on for five minutes.
[01:51:59.415 --> 01:52:04.856]  I mean, this is a trillion percent absolutely criminal.
[01:52:05.456 --> 01:52:07.518]  And they say it's because we showed violent things.
[01:52:07.518 --> 01:52:10.561]  No, Media Matters reported it, and it's because I was on there.
[01:52:10.561 --> 01:52:12.903]  So it shows how they can't even get their propaganda lined up.
[01:52:12.903 --> 01:52:16.046]  What do you think this is all ahead of?
[01:52:16.046 --> 01:52:18.929]  Well, it's either... Go ahead, John.
[01:52:20.129 --> 01:52:24.651]  Okay, no, I was going to say, is not violence the core of news?
[01:52:24.651 --> 01:52:29.874]  I mean, do you want to watch, people don't watch things, mom making apple pies, no.
[01:52:29.874 --> 01:52:34.456]  They like to see road accidents and mayhem and massacres.
[01:52:34.456 --> 01:52:42.640]  This is just human nature, so good God to say that, oh, you're offering people what the news offers them or what popular magazines offer.
[01:52:42.640 --> 01:52:43.000]  Bullshit!
[01:52:44.143 --> 01:52:45.446]  Why pick on you?
[01:52:45.446 --> 01:52:48.152]  Again, because you are in their face.
[01:52:48.152 --> 01:52:49.877]  You are a threat, Alex.
[01:52:49.877 --> 01:52:50.418]  End of story.
[01:52:54.397 --> 01:53:01.521]  They're mad that I'm pointing out that Google and Apple have moved to China and are helping censor there and literally helping arrest people and have them killed.
[01:53:01.521 --> 01:53:03.082]  So it shows they have absolutely no morals.
[01:53:03.082 --> 01:53:03.922]  They're totally ruthless.
[01:53:03.922 --> 01:53:09.285]  That Apple owns and leases the worst factories in China at Foxconn on record.
[01:53:09.285 --> 01:53:14.788]  And that also I was pointing out that they're planting a false flag against themselves and the media to blame us.
[01:53:14.788 --> 01:53:15.589]  I mean clearly
[01:53:16.169 --> 01:53:19.673]  Clearly, they're upset about what's being said here, so everybody should know.
[01:53:19.673 --> 01:53:24.178]  That means the answers to taking them on is being covered by myself and my guests and others.
[01:53:24.178 --> 01:53:26.020]  Owen, your comments on that?
[01:53:27.025 --> 01:53:33.710]  Well, I think John McAfee makes an excellent point, because think about what happened on September 11, 2001.
[01:53:33.710 --> 01:53:36.613]  All eyes were on television news all day long.
[01:53:36.613 --> 01:53:39.815]  That's what everyone was watching, millions of people.
[01:53:39.815 --> 01:53:42.638]  Like John said, violence, big event, tragedy.
[01:53:42.638 --> 01:53:43.999]  Everyone goes to the television news.
[01:53:43.999 --> 01:53:47.962]  So, if they're getting ready to pull some big false flag 9-11 style event,
[01:53:49.423 --> 01:54:06.098]  They can't have Alex Jones on air, they can't have InfoWars on air, they can't have these alternative news sources on air, on YouTube, on the internet, because everyone's gonna go there now, and they're not gonna go turn on the TV to hear what the official narrative is, because they've been lied to by the TV so much.
[01:54:06.098 --> 01:54:10.022]  So now they have to cut off, it's like, imagine you're going down a road,
[01:54:11.323 --> 01:54:14.905]  And you've got all these exits for alternative exits and different things.
[01:54:14.905 --> 01:54:16.545]  They're shutting all the exits down.
[01:54:16.545 --> 01:54:22.348]  They're shutting every exit down and they're forcing everyone to go down the same pipeline on the official narrative.
[01:54:22.348 --> 01:54:32.533]  So, it would make sense if they're going to pull some big event, they have to cut out the new news that has the biggest audience, like the Alex Jones Show, Mark Dice YouTube channel.
[01:54:32.833 --> 01:54:42.321]  Because they're not going to go along with the official narrative, or at least question it, or provide other elements and other facts and other historical references, and they can't control the news that way.
[01:54:42.321 --> 01:54:43.782]  They can't control the narrative that way.
[01:54:43.782 --> 01:54:50.087]  So it would make sense, if there's some big false flag event coming up like a 9-11, they want all the eyes on Fox.
[01:54:50.487 --> 01:54:56.694]  CNN, MSNBC, who are going to tow the official narrative, no matter what, never question it.
[01:54:56.694 --> 01:55:02.500]  Alex Jones, who may question it and provide some other historical analysis, he cannot exist.
[01:55:02.500 --> 01:55:04.202]  We have to shut him down before that event.
[01:55:04.202 --> 01:55:05.463]  We have to control the narrative.
[01:55:05.503 --> 01:55:13.771]  And they're using the hype of things I didn't say about Sandy Hook to say, oh look, it's hurtful to question a big public event like 9-11 or Gulf of Tonkin or Babies and Incubators.
[01:55:13.771 --> 01:55:14.291]  Don't do it.
[01:55:14.291 --> 01:55:17.634]  I think that's one of the most important things we've said here in a long time.
[01:55:17.634 --> 01:55:19.276]  On target, Owen Schroer.
[01:55:19.276 --> 01:55:23.220]  John McAfee, your take on that?
[01:55:23.220 --> 01:55:26.963]  Well, it actually kind of blew me away with that suggestion.
[01:55:26.963 --> 01:55:29.906]  That had not occurred to me, that maybe there is a false flag coming up.
[01:55:30.602 --> 01:55:32.283]  We know for a fact.
[01:55:32.283 --> 01:55:36.564]  I mean, I have good friends within the CIA, and they have confided in me.
[01:55:36.564 --> 01:55:44.826]  Yes, of course, the CIA does create false flags of enormous scope and scale.
[01:55:44.826 --> 01:55:47.206]  So we know what happens.
[01:55:47.206 --> 01:55:48.527]  And it would make sense.
[01:55:48.527 --> 01:55:50.267]  It would make total sense.
[01:55:50.267 --> 01:55:51.667]  Of course, why didn't they ban me?
[01:55:51.667 --> 01:55:53.768]  Because, you know, I'm as loud as you.
[01:55:53.768 --> 01:55:55.268]  I'm just older.
[01:55:55.268 --> 01:55:57.289]  I choose my words more carefully.
[01:56:00.430 --> 01:56:01.211]  Wow.
[01:56:01.211 --> 01:56:02.531]  Stay right there, both of you.
[01:56:02.531 --> 01:56:04.473]  I want you to ride shotgun into the next hour.
[01:56:04.473 --> 01:56:06.654]  We have Jack Posobiec of Naval Intelligence.
[01:56:06.654 --> 01:56:12.678]  I was never going to say that on air until they blew us cover, but he's a big patriot with the President, some high-level folks, I'll just tell you that.
[01:56:12.678 --> 01:56:17.241]  And we had Roger Stone with the breaking news that they're planning to indict
[01:56:18.341 --> 01:56:19.222]  Donald Trump Jr.
[01:56:19.222 --> 01:56:20.363]  very, very soon.
[01:56:20.363 --> 01:56:22.584]  Peshobic has very high-level sources.
[01:56:22.584 --> 01:56:23.665]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:56:23.665 --> 01:56:28.128]  And he is upset and has confirmed that that is indeed what is about to happen very, very soon.
[01:56:28.128 --> 01:56:29.609]  So tomorrow's news today.
[01:56:29.609 --> 01:56:30.490]  We'll be back.
[01:56:30.490 --> 01:56:32.131]  Listen, folks.
[01:56:32.131 --> 01:56:36.394]  When the big event comes, you've got to tell your friends, your family via email, via phone call, however.
[01:56:36.394 --> 01:56:38.095]  Come to Infowars.com.
[01:56:38.095 --> 01:56:40.017]  Get the live feeds when the big event comes.
[01:56:41.349 --> 01:56:48.031]  Whether it's an attempted assassination of Trump, a nuke going off, planes in the buildings, whatever they're planning, they've been bringing jihadis in and protecting them.
[01:56:48.031 --> 01:56:51.532]  McAfee helped expose a huge plan that Obama had down in Belize.
[01:56:51.532 --> 01:56:55.232]  I didn't really believe it, and later it came out and was all confirmed with Hezbollah.
[01:56:55.232 --> 01:56:59.653]  So, ooh, I want to talk to him about that, because Hezbollah's promised sleeper cells to attack Trump in the U.S.
[01:56:59.653 --> 01:57:01.254]  He broke that here four years ago.
[01:57:01.954 --> 01:57:02.715]  In studio.
[01:57:02.715 --> 01:57:05.398]  And then later it came out in federal documents that it was all true.
[01:57:05.398 --> 01:57:15.590]  I mean, I thought he escaped and all that incredible stuff and it was amazing, but he's like, well, it's because Hezbollah was after me, and Hamas, and Ryerson, and then it later all turned out to be true!
[01:57:15.590 --> 01:57:17.312]  So, unbelievable.
[01:57:17.312 --> 01:57:20.396]  Of course, if you wanted a jihad attack, do it through Belize, because they hand out passports.
[01:57:22.037 --> 01:57:22.537]  Bottom line.
[01:57:22.537 --> 01:57:23.057]  Spread the word.
[01:57:23.057 --> 01:57:24.178]  This is a huge time to be alive.
[01:57:24.178 --> 01:57:25.018]  It's all coming together.
[01:57:25.018 --> 01:57:26.058]  We need financial support.

[01:59:51.248 --> 01:59:53.950]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:16.603]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:16.603 --> 02:00:21.668]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:24.395 --> 02:00:26.356]  Jack Posobiec of One American News.
[02:00:26.356 --> 02:00:26.997]  Great Patriots.
[02:00:26.997 --> 02:00:28.717]  He'll be joining us in the next segment.
[02:00:28.717 --> 02:00:31.699]  He's got some really, really bad news that he's able to confirm.
[02:00:31.699 --> 02:00:34.901]  Roger Stone has great sources and first broke it yesterday.
[02:00:34.901 --> 02:00:36.562]  This is some really serious news.
[02:00:36.562 --> 02:00:39.363]  So, at Jack Posobiec on Twitter, he's coming up next segment.
[02:00:39.363 --> 02:00:47.508]  John McAvee obviously has been warning on this show for at least five years since he got out of Belize about Hezbollah sleeper cells in the U.S.
[02:00:47.508 --> 02:00:52.831]  Now the head of their Iranian military has come out and said that indeed they have sleeper cells that came in through Belize.
[02:00:53.431 --> 02:00:55.092]  And other areas.
[02:00:55.092 --> 02:00:56.413]  And so there's that.
[02:00:56.413 --> 02:00:59.735]  And he also warned that social media networks will become the main censors.
[02:00:59.735 --> 02:01:00.635]  They now admit they are.
[02:01:00.635 --> 02:01:01.856]  Even the Wall Street Journal.
[02:01:01.856 --> 02:01:03.417]  The social media de-platform.
[02:01:03.417 --> 02:01:04.238]  Endgame.
[02:01:04.238 --> 02:01:06.059]  Self-censorship.
[02:01:06.059 --> 02:01:07.119]  Wall Street Journal.
[02:01:07.119 --> 02:01:10.161]  Digital de-platforming become the censors.
[02:01:10.161 --> 02:01:13.083]  So when digital platforms become the censors, Americans don't trust the media.
[02:01:13.083 --> 02:01:14.124]  For a good reason.
[02:01:14.124 --> 02:01:20.708]  It seems, I'm going to get into the whole Hezbollah thing with you, John, because there's so many subjects, but it seems like even mainstream media is now turning on itself
[02:01:22.070 --> 02:01:32.659]  Starting with Tucker Carlson doing the right thing and then even other folks like Bill Maher and saying, now the president, this is really dangerous what's happened to Alex Jones.
[02:01:32.659 --> 02:01:33.780]  So I want to cover that first.
[02:01:33.780 --> 02:01:38.324]  Why do you think they're starting to admit, hey, this is dangerous?
[02:01:38.324 --> 02:01:39.405]  Because it's obvious.
[02:01:41.528 --> 02:01:43.989]  I mean, to me it's obvious.
[02:01:43.989 --> 02:01:52.512]  What could be more dangerous than to have a social media company decide what's true, Alex?
[02:01:52.512 --> 02:01:53.212]  I mean, fuck me!
[02:01:53.212 --> 02:01:59.815]  I mean, I have seen some strange things in this life, and when people tell me the weirdest stuff, I go, but maybe it's true.
[02:01:59.815 --> 02:02:00.935]  I don't know.
[02:02:00.935 --> 02:02:02.536]  I am not the judge, and neither are you.
[02:02:02.536 --> 02:02:04.076]  Neither is anyone.
[02:02:04.076 --> 02:02:05.177]  That's the danger.
[02:02:05.177 --> 02:02:08.078]  Defining what's real, Alex.
[02:02:08.078 --> 02:02:10.619]  Good God Almighty, what could be more dangerous than that?
[02:02:11.783 --> 02:02:13.063]  It's also incredibly arrogant.
[02:02:13.063 --> 02:02:27.929]  You know, Media Matters and George Soros literally are in the major tech companies colluding together, which is a total antitrust monopoly of information, not just unfair trade practices and so many other things that lawyers say is open and shut.
[02:02:27.929 --> 02:02:36.933]  But to have this group, the Democratic Party, in there running it all is just insane.
[02:02:36.933 --> 02:02:39.394]  Let's get back to why you got
[02:02:40.267 --> 02:02:52.638]  While they tried to kill you in Belize, and it's all been confirmed, now it's come out in mainstream news, the documents came out, that you, how you found out that they had jihadis coming through, and now, exactly what you said is all over the news.
[02:02:52.638 --> 02:03:04.769]  Well, you know, I'm outspoken and I do my own thing no matter where I am, and I unwisely did my own thing in a third world virtual dictatorship, even though they do have a voting system, it's all garbage.
[02:03:06.442 --> 02:03:13.268]  I ran afoul of the government and they demanded recompense.
[02:03:13.268 --> 02:03:17.292]  They asked for two million dollars for their election coming up and they would leave me alone.
[02:03:17.292 --> 02:03:20.094]  I go, I'm sorry, I don't do extortion.
[02:03:20.094 --> 02:03:28.962]  A week later, they stormed my property, shot my dog, destroyed a half million dollars worth of my property, abused me relatively, and then left.
[02:03:29.517 --> 02:03:34.521]  Well, I was pissed off, mostly about the dog, and I demanded an apology from the Prime Minister.
[02:03:34.521 --> 02:03:36.582]  Another foolish thing, okay?
[02:03:36.582 --> 02:03:41.426]  All the newspaper says is McAfee, quote, demands apology from Prime Minister.
[02:03:41.426 --> 02:03:44.669]  You don't do that in third world dictatorships.
[02:03:44.669 --> 02:03:59.440]  But in any case, you know, because I am who I am, I was able to donate laptops to government computers that had spyware that was almost like a virus that moved from one computer to another within the government.
[02:03:59.898 --> 02:04:01.919]  So pretty soon everybody's computer was tapped.
[02:04:01.919 --> 02:04:04.080]  Now I admit, that's illegal.
[02:04:04.080 --> 02:04:08.322]  But I'm not in Belize now and I broke no American laws by doing that.
[02:04:08.322 --> 02:04:14.385]  So, I wanted to find absolute proof that they had set me up.
[02:04:14.385 --> 02:04:15.506]  But I didn't.
[02:04:15.506 --> 02:04:24.050]  What I did find was that the Minister of Immigration was the largest human trafficker in all of Central America.
[02:04:24.050 --> 02:04:27.772]  And was responsible for selling passports to Hezbollah
[02:04:28.405 --> 02:04:37.373]  Where you could then go into Mexico, and from Mexico, you could take a mule across the border into America, just like everybody else.
[02:04:37.373 --> 02:04:39.955]  Huge business, you know, literally.
[02:04:39.955 --> 02:04:41.176]  And now it's all confirmed.
[02:04:41.176 --> 02:04:42.057]  John McAfee, stay there.
[02:04:42.057 --> 02:04:45.179]  We're going to give your websites out and more and talk about cryptocurrency.
[02:04:45.179 --> 02:04:51.285]  But first, ride shotgun with me, because we've got huge breaking news with Jack Posobiec in T-Minus 60 seconds, folks.
[02:04:51.285 --> 02:04:52.105]  This is huge.
[02:04:52.105 --> 02:04:53.406]  They're going after Don Jr.
[02:04:56.263 --> 02:05:00.204]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[02:05:00.204 --> 02:05:03.505]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates.
[02:05:03.505 --> 02:05:09.767]  But a lot of us on the Big Island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[02:05:09.767 --> 02:05:12.528]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles.
[02:05:13.268 --> 02:05:17.090]  An acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels.
[02:05:17.090 --> 02:05:23.555]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[02:05:23.555 --> 02:05:28.538]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[02:05:29.278 --> 02:05:33.201]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure gravity filter.
[02:05:33.201 --> 02:05:40.407]  And not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[02:05:40.407 --> 02:05:45.110]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water.
[02:05:45.110 --> 02:05:51.315]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[02:05:51.315 --> 02:05:55.298]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:06:06.912 --> 02:06:11.280]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:13.604]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:06:18.613 --> 02:06:30.337]  Jack Posobiec is a syndicated TV host and investigative journalist at One American News Networks, also Naval Intelligence Patriot, ran one of the biggest grassroots organizations for Trump in the campaign.
[02:06:30.337 --> 02:06:40.301]  He's got a lot of great sources and unfortunately he's able to confirm what Roger Stone, who's got amazing sources, broke yesterday here on air that...
[02:06:41.161 --> 02:06:46.726]  Robert Mueller is looking, and reportedly planning, to indict Donald Trump Jr.
[02:06:46.726 --> 02:06:51.490]  Not for the totally legal meeting with the lady saying she had dirt on Hillary.
[02:06:51.490 --> 02:06:55.193]  Gosh, the Clintons went to Russia to try to get fake dirt cooked up on Trump.
[02:06:55.193 --> 02:06:57.135]  That's opposition research.
[02:06:57.135 --> 02:06:59.297]  But for the old thing we warned about a year and a half ago.
[02:06:59.297 --> 02:07:05.101]  You talk to the FBI, then they can say that you materially lied to them or misled them.
[02:07:05.993 --> 02:07:08.315]  This is unbelievable.
[02:07:08.315 --> 02:07:11.638]  And if the economy wasn't coming back and other things, people might put up with this.
[02:07:11.638 --> 02:07:12.439]  They're not going to put up with it.
[02:07:12.439 --> 02:07:14.600]  And I'll add this.
[02:07:14.600 --> 02:07:29.012]  If Hillary wasn't in bed with the Russians and Uranium One and the secret server and the Mueller with tarmac meetings with giving the FSB uranium and secret transfers like James Bond, if Trump had people doing that, I'd say, get him out of there!
[02:07:29.838 --> 02:07:32.380]  So this, but no, he's bringing the country back.
[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:34.982]  It's obvious it's the globalists that have had their foot on our neck.
[02:07:34.982 --> 02:07:39.765]  So Jack Posobiec, you know, they tried to get you kicked out of naval intelligence to pull your security clearance.
[02:07:39.765 --> 02:07:43.208]  But then they all say, oh, we can keep our security clearances, but they're not valuable.
[02:07:43.208 --> 02:07:45.830]  But now they're freaking out because they are valuable.
[02:07:45.830 --> 02:07:48.572]  These people are anti-American to their core.
[02:07:48.572 --> 02:07:51.434]  How did a communist, admitted communist like Brennan, ever get in charge?
[02:07:51.434 --> 02:07:52.815]  But those are side issues.
[02:07:52.815 --> 02:07:53.396]  You're here.
[02:07:54.176 --> 02:07:59.498]  With the really serious news, what can you tell us there in D.C.
[02:07:59.498 --> 02:08:02.280]  from what your sources are telling us about Don Jr.?
[02:08:02.280 --> 02:08:03.480]  Well, Alex, you know, it's interesting.
[02:08:03.480 --> 02:08:08.282]  I'd actually heard this for a couple of weeks now, but I wasn't able to pin it down.
[02:08:08.282 --> 02:08:11.504]  But essentially what Mueller's been doing is going over Don Jr.'
[02:08:11.484 --> 02:08:16.826]  's testimony through the United States Senate, where he did testify, spent multiple hours testifying.
[02:08:17.461 --> 02:08:17.761]  Yes, we are.
[02:08:35.196 --> 02:08:38.377]  From, of course, Michael Cohen, who's cooperating with the special counsel and others.
[02:08:38.377 --> 02:08:40.899]  Laney Davis is out there essentially talking about this.
[02:08:40.899 --> 02:08:45.641]  So it's going to come down most likely to be his word against theirs.
[02:08:45.641 --> 02:08:51.163]  Now, if you notice very specifically, there were a few times during that Senate testimony that Don Jr.
[02:08:51.163 --> 02:08:54.324]  claimed attorney-client privilege for some of the questions they asked.
[02:08:54.324 --> 02:08:58.086]  Well, unfortunately, that attorney was Michael Cohen.
[02:08:58.086 --> 02:09:01.948]  And Michael Cohen has completely betrayed his oath, completely betrayed his
[02:09:02.867 --> 02:09:03.387]  Yes, we are.
[02:09:27.013 --> 02:09:36.555]  It's like firing Mueller or firing others that they believe then could be used as fuel for an impeachment scenario.
[02:09:36.555 --> 02:09:44.337]  If they arrest or indict and arrest Don Jr., I think if he takes the Gandhi Road, the American people, I think it's going to blow up in their face.
[02:09:44.337 --> 02:09:50.079]  If the president's son, because you know Mueller will do it, they'll throw him in prison just to make him do the perp walk.
[02:09:50.079 --> 02:09:54.880]  And then everybody will know that Hillary has engaged in one trillion times what they ever did.
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:09:58.621]  Sold this nation out, Benghazi, the Arab Spring.
[02:09:58.621 --> 02:10:04.583]  I mean, you try to chronicle looting Haiti, stealing millions, keeping 99% of the money for herself.
[02:10:04.583 --> 02:10:15.866]  And when you try to think about all the crimes of the Clintons and the sellouts to China and just all of it, and the uranium one, and the sending money into Russia to try to overthrow Putin and then laundering it back to the Ukraine.
[02:10:15.866 --> 02:10:19.207]  That's all come out even in Politico to her campaign and Obama.
[02:10:20.167 --> 02:10:26.375]  $84 million in unaccounted campaign cash, a $300-something-thousand-dollar fine, and then meanwhile they're going to try to do this.
[02:10:26.375 --> 02:10:34.284]  The president, totally legal 12 years ago for issues, and going back years ago making payments with his own money.
[02:10:34.284 --> 02:10:37.808]  I mean, this is just so obviously persecution.
[02:10:37.808 --> 02:10:38.790]  It's beyond hypocritical.
[02:10:40.103 --> 02:10:48.248]  No, not only that, Alex, and what I would add as well, and you mentioned just before in the opening, that this entire meeting was a setup by Fusion GPS to begin with.
[02:10:48.248 --> 02:10:57.654]  We know that Veselnitskaya, who proffered this meeting with Don Jr., Manafort and Kushner also took part, that she was working with Fusion GPS at the time.
[02:10:57.654 --> 02:11:05.699]  Fusion GPS, we know, was hired by the Clinton campaign through the Perkins-Coy Democrat, essentially it's the legal arm of the Democrat Party.
[02:11:05.699 --> 02:11:07.280]  So Fusion GPS has
[02:11:07.760 --> 02:11:09.661]  They're fingerprints all over this.
[02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:15.785]  We know that there were State Department translator was used to part this thing someone who had had ties to the FBI.
[02:11:15.785 --> 02:11:30.574]  So it really goes back to ask you a question of was this whole thing done as a way to set up or entrapped on junior to get this series of events in motion that they went and did went to him essentially offered him a conspiracy.
[02:11:31.054 --> 02:11:32.915]  Then went to see what does he do with it?
[02:11:32.915 --> 02:11:34.336]  Is he going to go talk to his dad about it?
[02:11:34.336 --> 02:11:36.277]  Is he going to go talk to Michael Cohen about it?
[02:11:36.277 --> 02:11:37.677]  Talk to the rest of the campaign?
[02:11:37.677 --> 02:11:41.779]  Knowing full well that they're watching him and watching what he's doing at the same time.
[02:11:41.779 --> 02:11:49.903]  This is the same way that the feds will essentially assert an informant into organizations that they want to then destabilize.
[02:11:49.903 --> 02:11:54.185]  So they'll have the informant walk around saying, hey guys, let's commit crimes, let's commit crimes.
[02:11:54.185 --> 02:11:58.807]  When the organization by and large themselves probably wouldn't have done that on their own.
[02:11:59.625 --> 02:12:17.996]  But even if they get someone discussing these things with the informant, they can then say there's a collusion to, or I should say, a conspiracy to collude, or a conspiracy to- That's right, and a lot of these transcripts have come out in court now, and you've got these different operatives over and over again saying, let's speak with Russia, let's speak with Russia, and they're like, no, Russia is an important stop.
[02:12:17.996 --> 02:12:18.277]  Exactly.
[02:12:18.277 --> 02:12:22.199]  Russia, Russia, Russia, and then a year and a half later, Mueller asked the person, did you ever talk to this person about Russia?
[02:12:22.199 --> 02:12:22.679]  No.
[02:12:22.679 --> 02:12:24.861]  Boom, you're going to prison, because you didn't remember it.
[02:12:24.861 --> 02:12:25.781]  You're like, what?
[02:12:25.781 --> 02:12:26.842]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[02:12:27.762 --> 02:12:30.182]  Right, you know, somebody talked about George Papadopoulos.
[02:12:30.182 --> 02:12:35.123]  He said, yeah, I had a conversation with a guy at a bar one time and he said something about Russia and I didn't think much of it.
[02:12:35.123 --> 02:12:37.684]  And he said, well, that guy reported you because he talked about Russia.
[02:12:37.684 --> 02:12:41.224]  And then Papadopoulos said, wait a minute, he's the one who brought up Russia.
[02:12:41.224 --> 02:12:42.124]  I didn't bring up Russia.
[02:12:42.124 --> 02:12:43.365]  That was a guy at a bar.
[02:12:43.365 --> 02:12:53.386]  That wasn't some kind of... Well, let me tell you how much I was sitting there during the inauguration tonight with a bunch of active duty Navy SEALs and people who just so happened to do secret submarine work.
[02:12:53.386 --> 02:12:54.787]  I didn't even know that.
[02:12:54.787 --> 02:12:56.447]  And then they would have guys walk over and say, hey,
[02:12:57.467 --> 02:13:03.549]  Alex, I know people from Taiwan that want to buy submarine secrets from you and you guys, and those guys got freaked out, man.
[02:13:03.549 --> 02:13:05.790]  And then other stuff like that was happening.
[02:13:05.790 --> 02:13:10.731]  And then, even though Obama's people were still there, they still got reported and called in about the submarines.
[02:13:10.731 --> 02:13:14.012]  So the Democrats literally know classified stuff.
[02:13:14.012 --> 02:13:21.055]  They have their operatives walking around and just, and then I guess they have data info on whoever we're with, and then they come over and try to set us up.
[02:13:21.055 --> 02:13:22.015]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[02:13:22.878 --> 02:13:35.143]  Yeah, these are these types of set-up operations and it's, I think, I think at this point it's been covered by yourself and many other sources that that Fusion GPS-backed meeting at Trump Tower was definitely a set-up of the Trump campaign.
[02:13:35.143 --> 02:13:39.065]  Now, what they're going to go back on is, of course, they're going to try to brush that under the table.
[02:13:39.065 --> 02:13:49.689]  The same way that in all of the court documents that Mueller has filed at this point, he's never once mentioned Stephen Halper, the spy that the FBI inserted into the Trump campaign to try to actually get a role in the campaign.
[02:13:49.949 --> 02:13:55.950]  He's completely covered that up, the setup angle of all of this, and said, you tried to collude with Russia and we have the proof.
[02:13:55.950 --> 02:14:00.672]  Yet he doesn't mention at all that there were these communications with this specific spy.
[02:14:00.672 --> 02:14:10.674]  I know at the same token, he's not going to mention any of the spies or any of the connections between Fusion GPS and all of the people who set this meeting up in the first place.
[02:14:10.674 --> 02:14:15.135]  Sure, or how it's 37 all Democrat operatives trying to set Trump up and there's no collusion been found.
[02:14:15.135 --> 02:14:17.036]  They're all trying to get him on process crimes.
[02:14:17.036 --> 02:14:18.516]  It's the thinnest thing ever.
[02:14:19.565 --> 02:14:20.585]  But let me ask this question.
[02:14:20.585 --> 02:14:22.526]  What does Trump need to do about this?
[02:14:22.526 --> 02:14:25.247]  Because this is so criminal, it's so obvious.
[02:14:25.247 --> 02:14:27.108]  Sessions is shooting his mouth off.
[02:14:27.108 --> 02:14:28.989]  He's 100% compromised.
[02:14:28.989 --> 02:14:33.411]  Session hits back at Trump, won't be influenced by political considerations.
[02:14:33.411 --> 02:14:33.931]  What?
[02:14:33.931 --> 02:14:35.472]  He's asleep at the switch?
[02:14:35.472 --> 02:14:38.033]  You've got Rosenstein involved in all this?
[02:14:38.033 --> 02:14:39.793]  I mean, they totally have hijacked the country.
[02:14:39.793 --> 02:14:42.174]  This is unbelievable.
[02:14:42.174 --> 02:14:45.856]  The president needs to start using the powers of the presidency aggressively.
[02:14:46.249 --> 02:14:50.432]  It's time for him to wield the pardon for these selective prosecutions.
[02:14:50.432 --> 02:14:52.294]  Wield the pardon power, which he has.
[02:14:52.294 --> 02:14:55.176]  And as well, it's time for him to start a deadline.
[02:14:55.176 --> 02:15:03.923]  Set a deadline for Mueller and say, you know, whether that's the midterm elections, whether that's Thanksgiving, set a deadline and say, I want your report on my desk by this time.
[02:15:03.923 --> 02:15:05.404]  You do not have a blank check.
[02:15:05.404 --> 02:15:07.426]  You don't get to run the Department of Justice.
[02:15:07.426 --> 02:15:09.367]  You don't get to do whatever you want with the country.
[02:15:09.367 --> 02:15:10.188]  I'm the president.
[02:15:10.188 --> 02:15:11.169]  I was duly elected.
[02:15:11.169 --> 02:15:11.429]  Exactly.
[02:15:11.909 --> 02:15:20.418]  Mueller, they act in the news, and Congress is trying to pass some law that violates the separation of powers, saying that Mueller is his own new Imperium Inquisitor.
[02:15:20.418 --> 02:15:23.501]  I mean, that's how Oliver Cromwell ended up, you know, taking over or whatever.
[02:15:23.501 --> 02:15:28.867]  I mean, we're sitting here looking at somebody literally being set up as a fourth branch of government.
[02:15:28.867 --> 02:15:32.271]  We'll talk to Jack Posobiec in one more segment from One American News Network.
[02:15:32.771 --> 02:15:38.798]  I noticed that when my app went to number one on Google and on Android Apple, theirs is right behind us.
[02:15:38.798 --> 02:15:43.023]  So how exciting to see One American News beating CNN and the New York Times.

[02:20:47.499 --> 02:20:54.583]  One more segment with our guests and we're going to have a South African pastor on to describe the white genocide exploding that President Trump's been covering.
[02:20:54.583 --> 02:20:56.003]  Jack Posobiec is our guest.
[02:20:56.003 --> 02:21:02.227]  By the way, Cloud TV owns One American Network and we're on thousands of different platforms.
[02:21:02.227 --> 02:21:08.951]  We've been taking off close to 30 big ones, as everybody knows, but Cloud TV has exploded.
[02:21:09.892 --> 02:21:15.674]  We have had hundreds of thousands of people a day, literally, tune into our streams over that.
[02:21:15.674 --> 02:21:18.354]  Much bigger than YouTube was after the shadowbatting began.
[02:21:18.354 --> 02:21:23.036]  NASA television, all of it's on there, One American News.
[02:21:23.036 --> 02:21:29.217]  So, very, very, very, very, Cloud TV, K-L-O-W-D TV.
[02:21:29.217 --> 02:21:32.178]  Be sure and check that out, an amazing service.
[02:21:32.178 --> 02:21:34.899]  Their flagship is One American News.
[02:21:35.399 --> 02:21:38.982]  So be sure and check that out, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:38.982 --> 02:21:40.243]  Going back to Jack Posobiec.
[02:21:40.243 --> 02:21:42.464]  Jack, this is just horrifying.
[02:21:42.464 --> 02:21:51.210]  I mean, there is Don Jr., such a patriot, such a good guy, out there fighting for this country, so committed.
[02:21:52.091 --> 02:21:56.773]  One of the best people around, his father, obviously, out there trying to get dirt on Hillary.
[02:21:56.773 --> 02:21:58.214]  He finds out it's a setup.
[02:21:58.214 --> 02:21:59.915]  Totally legal to do that.
[02:21:59.915 --> 02:22:03.317]  And then they're told it's about adoption of Russian kids.
[02:22:03.317 --> 02:22:07.379]  And then now, the word is that Mueller is gonna indict him.
[02:22:09.389 --> 02:22:10.250]  Here's the big question.
[02:22:10.250 --> 02:22:12.293]  Trump has threatened to declassify the evidence.
[02:22:12.293 --> 02:22:16.218]  Well, we've already seen what the liberals said before they changed their story.
[02:22:16.218 --> 02:22:23.146]  They were illegally spying on Trump, that nothing was there, that they were covering up Russiagate with the Clintons and Mueller.
[02:22:23.146 --> 02:22:25.650]  They're covering up their treason with this investigation.
[02:22:25.650 --> 02:22:27.832]  It's just like a movie where exactly what they say...
[02:22:28.737 --> 02:22:29.197]  We've done.
[02:22:29.197 --> 02:22:34.621]  The New York Times is calling everyone I know saying, has Jones been to Russia?
[02:22:34.621 --> 02:22:38.183]  Is Jones a Russian agent?
[02:22:38.183 --> 02:22:39.944]  They say Jones is paid by the Russians.
[02:22:39.944 --> 02:22:41.945]  Well, let me be clear.
[02:22:41.945 --> 02:22:43.246]  I almost did a stunt this year.
[02:22:43.246 --> 02:22:47.429]  So I got a Russian visa to go over there and make a big joke out of it.
[02:22:47.429 --> 02:22:50.310]  And then I decided this is so dangerous, I'm not going to do it.
[02:22:50.310 --> 02:22:51.151]  I tweeted out.
[02:22:52.731 --> 02:22:57.438]  The Russian Visa, and the media picked it up and said, we got his secret Russian Visa.
[02:22:57.438 --> 02:22:59.501]  So I've got the New York Times asking me, what's this?
[02:22:59.501 --> 02:23:01.223]  And I'm like, you people are maniacs.
[02:23:01.223 --> 02:23:02.205]  I've never been to Russia.
[02:23:02.205 --> 02:23:05.249]  But the witch-huntness of this is just crazy.
[02:23:05.249 --> 02:23:08.874]  So I'm ranting here, but I'm just asking, why doesn't Trump just declassify all this?
[02:23:10.387 --> 02:23:18.754]  Yeah, Alex, that's actually one of the main things that Trump's lawyers and his friends and legal advisors outside the White House have been urging.
[02:23:18.754 --> 02:23:20.896]  Some people are urging pardons.
[02:23:20.896 --> 02:23:24.259]  I personally think the pardons would be a very strong tool.
[02:23:24.259 --> 02:23:31.745]  But declassification of documents, declassification of the Carter Page FISA warrant, looking out for other FISA warrants that may have been
[02:23:32.305 --> 02:23:37.066]  On George Papadopoulos or Roger Stone, if we can find those, declassify those as well.
[02:23:37.066 --> 02:23:39.587]  Put all the cards on the table.
[02:23:39.587 --> 02:23:43.308]  Show us what paragraph one was of this investigation.
[02:23:43.308 --> 02:23:53.071]  What was the evidence that you claim people like John Brennan, people like James Comey claimed that they had on Donald Trump and these quote unquote ties to Russia?
[02:23:53.571 --> 02:23:55.092]  And show us what it was.
[02:23:55.092 --> 02:24:03.139]  And if you don't have anything better than this ridiculous Steele dossier, which we now know was paid for by the Clinton campaign, then shut it down.
[02:24:03.139 --> 02:24:17.010]  Shut it down, put a deadline on all of this, because we know it was crooked from the start, and then that should cast a taint over all the indictments and prosecutions that have come out of this, because we know that it was started on a faulty and false premise.
[02:24:17.230 --> 02:24:19.432]  It's the fruit of the poison tree, 101.
[02:24:19.432 --> 02:24:23.876]  It's like a surveillance footage a cop doesn't know that's there when he plants a gun on somebody.
[02:24:23.876 --> 02:24:26.358]  I mean, it doesn't matter what other evidence you've got, the people go free.
[02:24:26.358 --> 02:24:27.679]  But there is nothing.
[02:24:27.679 --> 02:24:33.384]  Can you believe in a year and a half of illegal surveillance and the stuff before that, and everything they've done, they've got nothing.
[02:24:33.384 --> 02:24:36.146]  It shows how incredibly clean Trump is.
[02:24:36.146 --> 02:24:41.251]  Alex, if they had something, it would have been leaked to the New York Times, the Washington Post on day one.
[02:24:41.251 --> 02:24:43.092]  It would have been leaked a long, long time ago.
[02:24:43.092 --> 02:24:44.834]  CNN would be blaring it all over the place.
[02:24:45.256 --> 02:24:57.980]  This would have come out by now if they had something substantial, and they don't, which is why they're grasping at straws and all of these process crimes that they're trying to do against the President's son, like they may try to do against Roger Stone as well.
[02:24:57.980 --> 02:25:06.083]  What I think is that people are starting to see this, and I think that people, even in the mainstream in middle America, Alex, they're not going to stand for it.
[02:25:06.083 --> 02:25:12.065]  They said, we elected this president, and if you don't like his policies, that's one thing, but fight that out at the ballot box.
[02:25:12.065 --> 02:25:13.326]  This whole ideal
[02:25:13.866 --> 02:25:17.209]  That we used to have in this country was the peaceful transfer of power.
[02:25:17.209 --> 02:25:19.151]  It was one of the hallmarks of the American Republic.
[02:25:19.151 --> 02:25:21.372]  Yeah, they're trying to overthrow an election.
[02:25:21.372 --> 02:25:23.094]  Exactly, they're trying to violate the will of the people.
[02:25:23.094 --> 02:25:25.656]  So let me ask you this, Jack, in closing, the few minutes we have left.
[02:25:27.321 --> 02:25:28.782]  What is the word on Sessions?
[02:25:28.782 --> 02:25:30.343]  I know you have amazing sources.
[02:25:30.343 --> 02:25:31.584]  What is the word?
[02:25:31.584 --> 02:25:33.485]  Do they have him in a KKK outfit?
[02:25:33.485 --> 02:25:35.266]  I mean, what is going on?
[02:25:35.266 --> 02:25:41.450]  The dereliction of duty, letting Rosenstein change the power of the Justice Department, letting them all run rogue.
[02:25:41.450 --> 02:25:43.131]  They've caught them all doing this.
[02:25:43.131 --> 02:25:45.872]  He was involved in the old days covering stuff up.
[02:25:45.872 --> 02:25:51.716]  I mean, at a certain point, it's almost a dereliction of duty if Trump doesn't fire them 15, 20 deep.
[02:25:51.716 --> 02:25:54.158]  I mean, my God, it's just time to start chopping
[02:25:54.978 --> 02:25:56.299]  Politically, heads off.
[02:26:12.453 --> 02:26:20.217]  If you want to find time on the floor for an AG vote and other confirmation, you can find time because that's your job, McConnell.
[02:26:20.217 --> 02:26:26.721]  You can find time to appoint anyone that we want that the President puts up as his AG and you can give him an up-down vote.
[02:26:26.721 --> 02:26:28.762]  You can do that, right?
[02:26:28.762 --> 02:26:33.405]  We can take some time away from voting for the next post office name change or something like that.
[02:26:33.405 --> 02:26:39.628]  The Attorney General of the United States at this point, regardless of what the reason is, he's not doing his job.
[02:26:39.628 --> 02:26:40.149]  He is not
[02:26:41.514 --> 02:26:46.516]  ...wielding the powers that have been given to him, and he's completely recused on pretty much everything.
[02:26:46.516 --> 02:26:52.638]  And even Rosenstein, by the way, has recused himself internally on the obstruction of justice issue.
[02:26:52.638 --> 02:26:59.561]  So Mueller at this point is almost given a completely free hand and completely free scope on what he's investigating.
[02:26:59.561 --> 02:27:03.022]  This has gone so far away from Russian interference and Russian meddling.
[02:27:03.022 --> 02:27:06.644]  That's because Mueller represents the neocons and the Bushites and all the rest of them.
[02:27:07.584 --> 02:27:12.207]  The mood of the country, from your view, in the swamp, but from without the swamp, I see the mood.
[02:27:12.207 --> 02:27:13.247]  People see prosperity.
[02:27:13.247 --> 02:27:14.508]  They see things turning around.
[02:27:14.508 --> 02:27:15.688]  They're genuinely angry.
[02:27:15.688 --> 02:27:21.391]  I predict a huge red tsunami, but there's going to be major Democratic cheating, so they might be able to even defeat that.
[02:27:21.391 --> 02:27:26.434]  Trump barely got over the hump, even though we know there was massive fraud because his wave was so big.
[02:27:26.914 --> 02:27:31.736]  But I think if they try to remove Trump or do any of this, I think it's going to be disastrous for the establishment.
[02:27:31.736 --> 02:27:35.098]  But like a mad dog with rabies, I don't think they can stop.
[02:27:35.098 --> 02:27:38.540]  So what do you think, Jack Posobiec from One American News Network?
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:40.561]  What do you think the mood is right now if they try this?
[02:27:42.185 --> 02:27:56.928]  If they try this, if they try to, as you mentioned, to go so far as to put, you know, the President's son in handcuffs or parade in front of cameras or something like that, I think you are going to see people out in the streets waving flags, waving signs.
[02:27:56.928 --> 02:27:59.309]  You're going to see protests at the Department of Justice.
[02:27:59.309 --> 02:28:11.131]  You're going to see protests in so many places because it will validate everything that Trump has said about this being a witch hunt and them going after him for political reasons, not for legal reasons.
[02:28:12.458 --> 02:28:15.621]  Jack Posobiec, thank you for joining us.
[02:28:15.621 --> 02:28:18.784]  What else are you going to be covering on One American News today?
[02:28:18.784 --> 02:28:27.372]  We're also going to be covering China's secret war on America, everything that China's doing to influence our elections, and why is nobody talking about that?
[02:28:27.372 --> 02:28:31.276]  Well, please come back soon and tell us about that, because more and more we're seeing that's really the real war going on.
[02:28:31.276 --> 02:28:36.341]  This whole Russia phantom is the diversion so that shycoms can influence this election.
[02:28:36.341 --> 02:28:37.382]  God bless you, Jack Posobiec.
[02:28:38.183 --> 02:28:39.625]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:28:39.625 --> 02:28:40.385]  Stay strong, man.
[02:28:40.385 --> 02:28:41.046]  Thank you, sir.
[02:28:41.046 --> 02:28:42.988]  Let's pray for Don Jr.
[02:28:42.988 --> 02:28:43.829]  and for the Trump family.
[02:28:43.829 --> 02:28:45.711]  These people have put it all on the line.
[02:28:45.711 --> 02:28:48.554]  Trump has lost over a billion dollars of his money doing this.
[02:28:48.554 --> 02:28:50.075]  Just thank God for Donald Trump, folks.
[02:28:50.075 --> 02:28:50.996]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:50.996 --> 02:28:52.458]  Thank God for you, by the way, all you listeners.

[02:29:25.234 --> 02:29:26.455]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:29:26.455 --> 02:29:30.377]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:29:30.377 --> 02:29:31.918]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:29:31.918 --> 02:29:34.879]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:29:34.879 --> 02:29:40.082]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:29:40.422 --> 02:29:41.624]  I can help you too.
[02:29:41.624 --> 02:29:44.567]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[02:29:44.567 --> 02:29:46.790]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[02:29:46.790 --> 02:29:51.236]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.

[02:31:08.113 --> 02:31:09.493]  You are the info war.
[02:31:09.493 --> 02:31:12.414]  And now because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever
[02:31:26.778 --> 02:31:38.163]  That everyone go to Infowars.com forward slash newsletter and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[02:31:38.163 --> 02:31:46.127]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the Infowars.com articles, to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[02:31:46.127 --> 02:31:53.170]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:31:53.170 --> 02:31:54.071]  We are the renaissance.
[02:31:54.671 --> 02:31:56.173]  And we are winning!
[02:31:56.173 --> 02:32:02.559]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:32:02.559 --> 02:32:05.782]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[02:32:05.782 --> 02:32:09.486]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:32:09.486 --> 02:32:14.190]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:17.453]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:32:18.334 --> 02:32:29.319]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:32:29.319 --> 02:32:37.862]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[02:32:39.483 --> 02:32:41.344]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:16.892 --> 02:33:21.254]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:21.254 --> 02:33:23.595]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.810 --> 02:33:42.472]  Ladies and gentlemen, it shocks even me knowing what the communists and leftists have been planning.
[02:33:42.472 --> 02:33:58.017]  We've had white Afrikaner farmers on who are the most un-racist, loving Christian people you can imagine, kind of like Amish, and who went into South Africa 400 years ago and built the whole place when no one was even there, and then huge tribal groups came in to take part in the prosperity.
[02:33:58.017 --> 02:33:58.918]  That's admitted history.
[02:33:59.838 --> 02:34:04.761]  There's 600 million hectares of land unused in Africa more than anywhere else in the world.
[02:34:04.761 --> 02:34:06.902]  60% of the world is there.
[02:34:06.902 --> 02:34:09.863]  Big article on Infowars.com dealing with this.
[02:34:09.863 --> 02:34:20.029]  Trump orders State Department to closely study South Africans being killed, white South Africans being killed, the genocide, and their own government lobbying Australia not to take them.
[02:34:20.029 --> 02:34:23.631]  And then you've got the Vice President saying we're going to slit your throats and kill you.
[02:34:23.631 --> 02:34:25.472]  The President saying we're going to take your land.
[02:34:26.252 --> 02:34:34.539]  They ran on that, and now Trump's being criticized by the left for saying that he's going to study it.
[02:34:34.539 --> 02:34:43.606]  And now Owen Schroer and Roger Stone's YouTube channel has been banned for violence because we showed black-on-white crime, which the left is pushing and promoting.
[02:34:43.606 --> 02:34:44.287]  We're Christians.
[02:34:44.287 --> 02:34:45.828]  We want everybody to live in peace.
[02:34:45.828 --> 02:34:50.272]  Now Zimbabwe, after decades of the white farmers being murdered and leaving, collapsed.
[02:34:50.272 --> 02:34:53.815]  They're now, I saw on the news, welking them back, crying and hugging them.
[02:34:54.415 --> 02:35:02.400]  So, this is an incredible time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen, and Pastor Rodney Howard Brown joins us.
[02:35:02.400 --> 02:35:06.343]  He runs Revival.com, a huge international church based in Florida.
[02:35:06.343 --> 02:35:07.684]  His new book is a bestseller.
[02:35:07.684 --> 02:35:09.225]  You can get it at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:35:09.225 --> 02:35:10.186]  They're trying to suppress it.
[02:35:10.186 --> 02:35:13.828]  KillingUncleSamBook.com is where you can get it, or Infowars.com.
[02:35:13.828 --> 02:35:16.810]  But the reason he joins us is he's from South Africa.
[02:35:16.810 --> 02:35:24.055]  He left there because of already the riots and the tyranny and the racial strife decades ago, and came here with his wife and children.
[02:35:25.036 --> 02:35:33.241]  And now he's been talking to people in the government, on the latest, what's happening, but the killings, the torturing, the shops being burned.
[02:35:33.241 --> 02:35:37.024]  I mean, you can just, you know, go online and just look at it.
[02:35:39.600 --> 02:35:42.361]  It's amazing what's going on.
[02:35:42.361 --> 02:35:45.222]  And so Pastor Brown, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:35:45.222 --> 02:35:46.942]  So you've got the floor of the next two segments.
[02:35:46.942 --> 02:36:01.047]  Kind of give people an overview so they know why it's getting so bad right now and the type of genocide we've seen against whites in other areas of Africa following the same Zimbabweification, which you and others have predicted.
[02:36:02.548 --> 02:36:06.116]  The horror of the British government actually saying they agree with this.
[02:36:06.116 --> 02:36:10.045]  I mean, this is next level showing the virtue signaling.
[02:36:11.761 --> 02:36:15.143]  Hey Alex, great to be with you again today.
[02:36:15.143 --> 02:36:17.625]  You know, here's the problem right now.
[02:36:17.625 --> 02:36:28.071]  There's struggles going on inside the ANC between Julius Malema, who is from the EFF, and he's the one that's actually really pushing this.
[02:36:28.071 --> 02:36:37.336]  And of course when the new president came in, for whatever reason, he started to talk along those lines and basically talked about land being taken away.
[02:36:37.336 --> 02:36:40.538]  And it wasn't only just white land, it was also black land.
[02:36:40.738 --> 02:36:43.319]  The Indian land, just really any land.
[02:36:43.319 --> 02:36:49.221]  But that, as you and I know, that's all the plan of what socialism does.
[02:36:49.221 --> 02:36:51.902]  You can see the same thing happening in Venezuela.
[02:36:51.902 --> 02:36:59.444]  And of course the killing of the farmers, which we understand the problems of the past, however, is also to destroy the food supply.
[02:36:59.444 --> 02:37:06.847]  Because if the food supply is destroyed, then the people are reliant upon the government and they can play with them like somebody plays with putty.
[02:37:07.447 --> 02:37:12.710]  And then, of course, the killing that's going on because they opened the borders.
[02:37:12.710 --> 02:37:18.493]  The country should have a population of 55 million, according to the Census Bureau.
[02:37:18.493 --> 02:37:25.236]  From inside, in Pretoria, who I've spoken to, they said unofficially it's close to 100 million people.
[02:37:25.236 --> 02:37:32.880]  So you have the black-on-black violence, the xenophobia that's taking place, because the tribes of the North are taking the jobs of the tribes of the South.
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:37.185]  And then of course this whole thing of land and the killing of the farmers.
[02:37:37.185 --> 02:37:41.572]  So I'd say there's close to about 60 murders a day, violent murders.
[02:37:41.572 --> 02:37:44.236]  About 22 are whites, the rest are blacks.
[02:37:44.236 --> 02:37:48.143]  And this is happening in the townships as they're hacking people into pieces.
[02:37:49.861 --> 02:38:07.616]  It looks like Ramaphosa is leaning towards trying to appease Julius Malema and EFF by saying look we'll take away the land because he's trying to unify the ANC's base before the national election come next year because they're afraid that the ANC is gonna lose.
[02:38:07.616 --> 02:38:12.801]  I just, when I knew I was coming here with you, I made a call to Dr Kenneth Mishra
[02:38:13.241 --> 02:38:13.902]  We're good to go.
[02:38:38.244 --> 02:38:40.885]  So, I said, is land being confiscated?
[02:38:40.885 --> 02:38:45.947]  He said, look, if there's any attempt right now, the police are stepping in and stopping it.
[02:38:45.947 --> 02:38:53.931]  So, yes, the killing's happening, but they have not really actually confiscated anything and the ones that have tried, the police are stopping it.
[02:38:54.811 --> 02:39:01.556]  The President Trump's tweet has really shocked everybody because they don't want him to, they don't know what he's going to do.
[02:39:01.556 --> 02:39:07.000]  And so I want to thank the President for just sending a shot across the bow.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:22.752]  But according to the report from Dr. Kenneth Mishra, who is a senior member of Parliament since 1994, he was in Parliament, heard the President yesterday get up and say that they were looking at everything again and they were kind of
[02:39:23.773 --> 02:39:23.913]  Yeah.
[02:39:42.698 --> 02:39:46.760]  You know, he's always been the radical right from day one.
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:49.440]  And of course, Malema's being controlled from England.
[02:39:49.440 --> 02:39:53.482]  So a lot of this stuff is not, you know, just Malema's crazy.
[02:39:53.482 --> 02:39:57.843]  I was about to say, the British government has come out basically in support of this.
[02:39:57.843 --> 02:40:07.187]  And so people don't understand that the history of South Africa, maybe in 60 seconds, I mean, the Brits have only been there about 150, 200 years coming in trying to take it.
[02:40:07.187 --> 02:40:10.388]  So they've always been, not the British people, but the government, manipulating things.
[02:40:11.673 --> 02:40:12.073]  Correct.
[02:40:12.073 --> 02:40:18.917]  So, I mean, the whole fight, South Africa actually only got independence from the UK back in 1961.
[02:40:18.917 --> 02:40:22.059]  Before 61, they would sing God Save the Queen.
[02:40:22.059 --> 02:40:31.445]  So, you know, it was a part of the British Commonwealth, much like Rhodesia or Zimbabwe, and Australia and New Zealand still are.
[02:40:31.445 --> 02:40:38.449]  And then, of course, they got independence from England in 1961, the year that I was born.
[02:40:38.949 --> 02:40:39.089]  Yes.
[02:40:58.451 --> 02:40:59.012]  Well, exactly.
[02:41:15.805 --> 02:41:19.389]  For those who don't know, the real colonialists, these big megacorporations, don't want stability.
[02:41:19.389 --> 02:41:20.651]  So they took out Gaddafi.
[02:41:20.651 --> 02:41:23.614]  So they took out the apartheid, which was not a good thing.
[02:41:23.614 --> 02:41:24.815]  Gaddafi wasn't good either.
[02:41:24.815 --> 02:41:25.977]  But they were stabilizing.
[02:41:25.977 --> 02:41:26.898]  There was wealth.
[02:41:26.898 --> 02:41:29.541]  And then now all of Africa has doubled its numbers the last 10 years.
[02:41:29.541 --> 02:41:30.181]  It's imploding.
[02:41:30.842 --> 02:41:37.405]  South Africa has huge people pouring into it out of collapsed areas where they already killed all the whites and took their land to the north.
[02:41:37.405 --> 02:41:45.148]  And so the same scenario is starting up again as communists pour in saying now kill the whites again so we can eat this week but we'll starve.
[02:41:45.148 --> 02:41:46.969]  But then they would have run out of continent.
[02:41:46.969 --> 02:41:50.891]  So they're to the north running into Europe and to the south running into the sea.
[02:41:52.415 --> 02:41:54.358]  And all of this is by design.
[02:41:54.358 --> 02:41:55.539]  Nothing is by accident.
[02:41:55.539 --> 02:41:59.504]  It's not just a group of people at random deciding they're going to do this.
[02:41:59.504 --> 02:42:01.306]  So all of this is planned.
[02:42:01.306 --> 02:42:07.394]  And you can see the same... I see the same tell-tale signs here in America as we see what's happening... It's an exact blueprint!
[02:42:07.574 --> 02:42:10.979]  It's an exact blueprint where all over the place professors say whites are bad.
[02:42:10.979 --> 02:42:12.061]  I denounce my whiteness.
[02:42:12.061 --> 02:42:12.641]  Kill whites.
[02:42:12.641 --> 02:42:14.344]  Whites inherently need to be gotten rid of.
[02:42:14.344 --> 02:42:22.095]  If we try to show the Antifa attacks or black attacks on whites, the media literally censors us and will not let us show it.
[02:42:22.095 --> 02:42:23.938]  Just like they won't show the Islamic crime in Europe.
[02:42:25.106 --> 02:42:34.372]  Yeah, so basically, whole groups are being funded right now by Open Society to preach critical race theory.
[02:42:34.372 --> 02:42:42.358]  Which basically, I mean, I just saw a book that came out, they were talking about it at one of the seminaries, called, Can a White Man Be Saved?
[02:42:42.358 --> 02:42:45.840]  I mean, how do people come up with this insanity?
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:52.985]  When we know from the Bible that the gospel's for every tribe and for every tongue, and that Jesus died for every tribe.
[02:42:52.985 --> 02:42:54.086]  That's right, we'll be right back, Pastor.
[02:42:55.379 --> 02:42:57.720]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:42:59.880]  We're really, really proud of it.

[02:43:56.468 --> 02:43:57.909]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[02:43:57.909 --> 02:44:11.695]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia, and then waddle
[02:44:11.855 --> 02:44:12.275]  I think so.
[02:44:31.764 --> 02:44:41.226]  It's also critical to go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter and give us your email so that we can stay in contact with you and send you videos and articles on our own platform.

[02:44:53.329 --> 02:44:54.609]  This is what they don't want you to see.

[02:46:52.979 --> 02:46:54.320]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.246 --> 02:47:16.227]  Alright folks, Alex Jones here, back live.
[02:47:16.227 --> 02:47:21.630]  I want to go right back to the pastor because this is so critical on so many fronts, but if I don't plug, we won't be here.
[02:47:21.630 --> 02:47:26.013]  We're selling his book, The Killing of Uncle Sam, that is the best because it's up to date.
[02:47:26.013 --> 02:47:38.600]  Condensed real history of Dunder, call it conspiracy, tragedy, and hope, but all where that ended in the 60s and 70s and then updated, written with former high-level CIA folks, you know, you name it, that helped them put it together.
[02:47:38.600 --> 02:47:40.421]  It is the definitive book.
[02:47:40.421 --> 02:47:40.782]  I read it.
[02:47:41.696 --> 02:47:46.822]  Over a weekend, even though it's a big, thick book, because it's little, concise chapters.
[02:47:46.822 --> 02:47:49.345]  You want to have a real master's degree in how the world works.
[02:47:49.345 --> 02:47:59.478]  You want to have your high school students, instead of just believing all the fake reality they're taught, you read this, they will have a real college education on how the world really works and the value.
[02:48:00.515 --> 02:48:02.096]  of knowing this value.
[02:48:02.096 --> 02:48:13.826]  I grew up with my dad teaching me all this, because he was aware of all this, and family that I had that had been involved in things that let them know how real this was, and who told me how things worked.
[02:48:13.826 --> 02:48:21.412]  This is more of an education than I got over all those years from family, and this book or that book, in one book, The Killing of Uncle Sam, available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:48:21.412 --> 02:48:27.797]  And listen, Pastor Brown, myself, we're not making any money selling this book under the attacks we're under, the way he's being censored, the way he's being attacked.
[02:48:28.925 --> 02:48:30.086]  We're victorious though.
[02:48:30.086 --> 02:48:32.447]  We're not victims, we're targets.
[02:48:32.447 --> 02:48:34.588]  But we need your prayers, we need your financial support.
[02:48:34.588 --> 02:48:39.010]  I've got a bunch of great new products at m4warsandlife.com.
[02:48:39.010 --> 02:48:40.651]  This kept selling out as everybody knows.
[02:48:40.651 --> 02:48:42.872]  It was known as Caveman Ultimate Bone Broth.
[02:48:42.872 --> 02:48:44.753]  We have it stronger, a new manufacturer.
[02:48:45.908 --> 02:48:54.416]  It's amazing, and instead of it costing me $25 to make each keg of it, now we've ordered four times more, so I got the price down.
[02:48:54.416 --> 02:48:58.660]  So instead of selling it for $40, I'm selling it for $19.95.
[02:48:58.660 --> 02:49:02.504]  Higher quality, lower cost, but I said double the order.
[02:49:02.504 --> 02:49:05.466]  Well, they'd already doubled the last, so they misunderstood it and quadrupled the order.
[02:49:05.466 --> 02:49:05.807]  My fault.
[02:49:07.298 --> 02:49:12.420]  And I signed the contract, you know, not looking as I'm so busy, and so we do have a megaton of it.
[02:49:12.420 --> 02:49:15.022]  But it's really high quality, just came in.
[02:49:15.022 --> 02:49:17.003]  Two 18-wheelers full of it.
[02:49:17.003 --> 02:49:18.003]  I'm not joking.
[02:49:18.003 --> 02:49:19.424]  So it's $19.95.
[02:49:19.424 --> 02:49:22.525]  Leading competitors aren't even as strong or good, and they're double the price.
[02:49:22.525 --> 02:49:23.966]  Chicken bone broth concentrated.
[02:49:23.966 --> 02:49:25.527]  You know how good that is for you.
[02:49:25.527 --> 02:49:27.148]  You know the bone broth research.
[02:49:27.148 --> 02:49:31.710]  Turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder, and even more.
[02:49:33.217 --> 02:49:41.219]  Your son's playing football, your daughter's a ballerina, you're into sports, you want stuff for your joints, stamina, energy, you cannot beat Ultimate Braunboth.

[02:49:48.222 --> 02:49:51.963]  But I'm only gonna do this for a week or so because we're selling a lot of it at this price.
[02:49:51.963 --> 02:49:53.743]  People realize what a good deal it is.
[02:49:53.743 --> 02:49:56.684]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139.
[02:49:56.684 --> 02:49:58.845]  We also have Ultimate Female Force just came in.
[02:50:03.522 --> 02:50:05.604]  Which is the equivalent of alpha power for women.
[02:50:05.604 --> 02:50:10.670]  I mean, it is the strongest, natural, healthy, herbal, and key compound for women.
[02:50:10.670 --> 02:50:14.434]  For energy, for stamina, for everything.
[02:50:14.434 --> 02:50:16.957]  For your hair, your nails, it's super strong.

[02:50:51.000 --> 02:50:51.480]  Because let me tell you,
[02:50:52.725 --> 02:50:54.047]  We've got some really good news coming.
[02:50:54.047 --> 02:50:55.349]  That's why they're panicking.
[02:50:55.349 --> 02:50:57.211]  We're about to get a bunch of these lawsuits thrown out.
[02:50:57.211 --> 02:50:59.194]  We've already had a bunch thrown out.
[02:50:59.194 --> 02:51:04.100]  But they've done some really dirty stuff that I'm not going to get into on air, and it's really made some people mad.
[02:51:04.100 --> 02:51:07.064]  I'm not supposed to get into it, so I'm going to stop, but just praise God.
[02:51:07.745 --> 02:51:11.727]  But it's going to take a lot of money to beat this, and now that's why they want me arrested.
[02:51:11.727 --> 02:51:14.729]  That's why they're saying I'm a criminal now, and all these crazy lies.
[02:51:14.729 --> 02:51:16.210]  Let me tell you, I'm not scared.
[02:51:16.210 --> 02:51:17.531]  I'm scared of failure, though.
[02:51:17.531 --> 02:51:20.293]  They're doing some really dirty stuff behind the scenes.
[02:51:20.293 --> 02:51:21.273]  It's biblical.
[02:51:21.273 --> 02:51:24.075]  I mean, they are calling people up and threatening my family.
[02:51:24.075 --> 02:51:25.616]  They're threatening other people.
[02:51:25.616 --> 02:51:30.059]  They're digging into other people's background and trying to find something wrong, like through Trump, and threatening them.
[02:51:31.099 --> 02:51:33.380]  Uh, and yes, Mueller is after me.
[02:51:33.380 --> 02:51:35.300]  They're investigating me as a Russian agent.
[02:51:35.300 --> 02:51:38.241]  They're also investigating me on other things, but I trust in Christ.
[02:51:38.241 --> 02:51:40.962]  But I'm just telling you, these people are evil.
[02:51:40.962 --> 02:51:42.023]  And they're making their moves.
[02:51:42.023 --> 02:51:47.825]  So I need your prayers, and I thank you for them, and I need you to support us financially and to spread the articles and videos.
[02:51:47.825 --> 02:51:49.985]  Because they're really mad right now, this is blowing up in their face.
[02:51:49.985 --> 02:51:52.026]  Pastor, I'm sorry I had to rant and get that out.
[02:51:52.026 --> 02:51:54.827]  Back to you and what's happening in South Africa, the same thing being done here.
[02:51:55.787 --> 02:51:59.330]  The fact that Trump said, hey, stop censoring so Twitter quit.
[02:51:59.330 --> 02:52:00.791]  He said, hey, don't kill all these farmers.
[02:52:00.791 --> 02:52:03.334]  So they stopped and the police did the right thing.
[02:52:03.334 --> 02:52:06.756]  I mean, the fact of the moral authority of America, Trump is so precious.
[02:52:06.756 --> 02:52:07.837]  The economy is coming back.
[02:52:07.837 --> 02:52:10.119]  The blessing of Abraham's coming back is what I'd call it.
[02:52:10.119 --> 02:52:13.242]  He called God back in at that at that inauguration.
[02:52:13.242 --> 02:52:14.903]  I can feel the energy.
[02:52:14.903 --> 02:52:16.845]  Where are we at a historical point right now?
[02:52:18.772 --> 02:52:20.633]  Well, I think we had a critical mass.
[02:52:20.633 --> 02:52:29.577]  I was talking to somebody just the other day and they said, you know, it's almost like many in the church world have kind of relaxed now with Trump in office.
[02:52:29.577 --> 02:52:37.081]  But we're actually in a very dangerous time in America because if we don't stand up, we have a window to turn this thing around.
[02:52:37.081 --> 02:52:42.564]  One of our associate evangelists who went to Newark, New Jersey on Sunday night, listen to this, Alex.
[02:52:43.204 --> 02:52:51.229]  In a park, Lincoln Park, Newark, New Jersey, the police said between 10,000 to 11,000 people showed up on the field.
[02:52:51.229 --> 02:52:55.512]  Now they were supposed to have a week-long permit for this meeting.
[02:52:55.512 --> 02:52:57.253]  Thousands of people are getting saved.
[02:52:57.253 --> 02:53:00.194]  They did Sunday night, Monday night, Tuesday night.
[02:53:00.194 --> 02:53:03.637]  Tuesday night, the city would not extend their permit.
[02:53:03.637 --> 02:53:05.498]  They already had a week-long permit.
[02:53:05.498 --> 02:53:09.540]  They already put up electronic signs saying this meeting is ending tonight.
[02:53:09.540 --> 02:53:10.961]  This is the city of Newark.
[02:53:11.631 --> 02:53:14.592]  And so, a lot of it's controlled by Islam.
[02:53:14.592 --> 02:53:16.573]  They do not want the Gospel preached.
[02:53:16.573 --> 02:53:19.274]  So they had to move the meeting indoors.
[02:53:19.274 --> 02:53:22.015]  They're there last night indoors and tonight and tomorrow.
[02:53:22.015 --> 02:53:26.756]  But that takes away from the momentum because people are coming by the thousands.
[02:53:26.756 --> 02:53:29.197]  Totally.
[02:53:29.197 --> 02:53:32.398]  Explain the Holy Ghost comes in and it's been well documented.
[02:53:32.398 --> 02:53:34.899]  Literally people for miles around just feel it and are drawn to it.
[02:53:36.485 --> 02:53:47.850]  Yeah, so, and one of the leading DJs in the area, a lady that's not even actually a Christian, what she'd been doing is advertising the meeting, so thousands of people are coming.
[02:53:47.850 --> 02:53:51.572]  And so, obviously the city don't want this, they're trying to put a stop to it.
[02:53:51.572 --> 02:53:53.693]  I mean, this is in Newark, New Jersey.
[02:53:53.693 --> 02:54:05.659]  So we have a window, even under Trump presidency, that if we don't preach the gospel and mobilize people in the streets and to turn this thing around, that it'll all be shut down.
[02:54:06.059 --> 02:54:08.720]  You know, we don't know what's going to happen by the 2020.
[02:54:08.720 --> 02:54:16.681]  I mean, I have a feeling, I believe we will get another term, but we have a window nonetheless, and we have to stand and we have to fight.
[02:54:16.681 --> 02:54:23.043]  What you're doing... I think what you're saying is, God will give us the victory, but we have to take action, and then we'll be given the victory.
[02:54:23.043 --> 02:54:30.785]  It's a sure, but we have to take action, and Google and Apple, they're all taking Christian holidays off their calendars, but adding Islamic ones everywhere.
[02:54:30.785 --> 02:54:32.345]  Cities pay to have huge Islamic
[02:54:32.645 --> 02:54:34.507]  As a matter of fact, the police are 100% behind him.
[02:54:34.507 --> 02:54:35.508]  They all stood in line for prayer.
[02:54:35.508 --> 02:54:36.029]  They were crying.
[02:54:36.029 --> 02:54:37.650]  They said we don't want you to leave.
[02:54:53.624 --> 02:54:54.365]  Sure, no.
[02:54:54.365 --> 02:54:58.128]  But, I mean, the fact is that the city wouldn't extend the permitting.
[02:54:58.128 --> 02:55:02.793]  So, I mean, we have to get a hold of the congressmen and senators.
[02:55:02.793 --> 02:55:04.654]  This kind of stuff is bogus.
[02:55:04.654 --> 02:55:09.859]  Because, you know, Islam's allowed to go run free course across America.
[02:55:09.859 --> 02:55:13.523]  But the Gospel needs to be allowed to run free course across America.
[02:55:13.523 --> 02:55:14.644]  I mean, what are they afraid of?
[02:55:15.024 --> 02:55:16.986]  Are they afraid they're going to lose followers?
[02:55:16.986 --> 02:55:21.350]  Are they afraid that the gospel has more power than anything that they could say?
[02:55:21.350 --> 02:55:22.451]  Obviously they are.
[02:55:22.451 --> 02:55:27.797]  That's why they want to center conservatives and people that preach the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[02:55:27.797 --> 02:55:31.821]  But Alex, I don't believe that they're going to be able to stop it.
[02:55:31.821 --> 02:55:35.304]  There's an army of people that God is raising up in this hour.
[02:55:35.304 --> 02:55:38.287]  And your voice has lit the fire for many, many years.
[02:55:38.667 --> 02:55:42.252]  And so, you know, it's not going to rest upon one.
[02:55:42.252 --> 02:55:44.616]  It's this whole army that God is raising up.
[02:55:44.616 --> 02:55:49.723]  They're going to carry the gospel of Jesus, that we believe that we're going to have another great spiritual awakening.
[02:55:49.723 --> 02:55:54.049]  And even back with South Africa, as I told the senior Congress member,
[02:55:54.509 --> 02:55:56.070]  I remember Parliament.
[02:55:56.070 --> 02:55:58.071]  I said, listen, we're praying for you.
[02:55:58.071 --> 02:55:58.871]  Stand.
[02:55:58.871 --> 02:55:59.972]  Speak the word.
[02:55:59.972 --> 02:56:05.314]  I'm just concerned about some of our South African pastors that don't ever mention anything from the pulpit.
[02:56:05.314 --> 02:56:06.575]  It's like they're afraid.
[02:56:06.575 --> 02:56:10.236]  They're concerned about the ramifications of it.
[02:56:10.236 --> 02:56:13.718]  But if we don't hang together, we'll hang separately.
[02:56:13.718 --> 02:56:21.281]  And if we don't stand up and proclaim the word of God, all that has to happen for evil to prevail is for good people to do nothing.
[02:56:21.281 --> 02:56:22.502]  And so we have to stand up.
[02:56:23.228 --> 02:56:25.410]  We got a shout out from the mountaintops.
[02:56:25.410 --> 02:56:28.712]  And look, I mean, we've already counted the cost, Alex.
[02:56:28.712 --> 02:56:30.313]  You know, you see the front of the book.
[02:56:30.313 --> 02:56:31.975]  If it means death, then so be it.
[02:56:31.975 --> 02:56:35.377]  I don't plan to die, but I'm not going to live in fear.
[02:56:35.377 --> 02:56:39.280]  But we have done nothing wrong, but we're going to stand and speak the truth.
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:45.905]  And you know, as I always tell people from the pulpit, if the cat's fur is getting rubbed the wrong way, let the cat turn around.
[02:56:45.905 --> 02:56:50.389]  And if they don't like it, I say, don't let the door hit you where the good Lord splits you.
[02:56:50.389 --> 02:56:50.629]  I mean,
[02:56:51.549 --> 02:56:55.610]  I'm a radical, you know, I'm going to say what I feel in my heart and in my spirit.
[02:56:55.610 --> 02:57:01.151]  And I, so, you know, I told this evangelist, I said, look, don't, don't give up.
[02:57:01.151 --> 02:57:02.551]  God's going to work another way.
[02:57:02.551 --> 02:57:13.713]  What they should have had was a piece of ground just outside the city limits that they could have gone to and, and, and had that, but they didn't, they didn't have that as a backup.
[02:57:13.713 --> 02:57:15.854]  So we're always going to have a backup.
[02:57:15.854 --> 02:57:17.314]  If they do this, we'll do this.
[02:57:17.834 --> 02:57:23.535]  You know, we ought to be thinking steps ahead of the enemy, and just continually do what we're supposed to do.
[02:57:23.535 --> 02:57:30.617]  As far as South Africa's concerned, the President sent a shot across the bow that's got everybody afraid, so they're backing off.
[02:57:30.617 --> 02:57:31.417]  They're back-paddling.
[02:57:31.417 --> 02:57:33.957]  Pastor Brown, I know you've got to go, but we've got a two-minute break.
[02:57:33.957 --> 02:57:35.018]  We're going to come back.
[02:57:35.018 --> 02:57:36.018]  We're going to do five more minutes with you.
[02:57:36.018 --> 02:57:39.939]  You want to come back and ask what else you think is on the horizon and how important this election is, 2018.
[02:57:39.939 --> 02:57:41.239]  Stay with us.
[02:57:41.239 --> 02:57:41.879]  We'll be right back.

[02:58:51.513 --> 02:58:52.454]  They take hours.

[02:58:54.875 --> 02:58:56.056]  It's stronger.
[02:58:56.056 --> 02:58:57.677]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[02:58:57.677 --> 02:59:00.899]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[02:59:00.899 --> 02:59:02.019]  It's back in stock.
[02:59:02.019 --> 02:59:05.201]  The Real Red Pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:59:05.201 --> 02:59:06.342]  It's got the preglanone.
[02:59:06.342 --> 02:59:08.984]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:59:08.984 --> 02:59:12.085]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids.
[02:59:12.085 --> 02:59:12.966]  So you can upload it.
[02:59:12.966 --> 02:59:14.407]  And our latest product, it goes great.
[02:59:15.007 --> 02:59:22.168]  The Super Blue Colloidal Silver and Iodine Fortified Toothpaste is Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle.
[02:59:22.168 --> 02:59:23.068]  It's a spray you do.
[02:59:23.068 --> 02:59:24.349]  You can also swallow it.
[02:59:24.349 --> 02:59:29.690]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high-quality silver, and a lot more.
[02:59:29.690 --> 02:59:31.090]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[02:59:31.090 --> 02:59:41.011]  So thank you all for remembering InfoWareStore.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake, and it's so essential to spread the word.
[02:59:41.011 --> 02:59:44.052]  Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:59:49.173 --> 02:59:51.775]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:07.455 --> 03:00:12.158]  All right, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is here from Revival.com, and we only have five minutes left with him.
[03:00:12.158 --> 03:00:14.399]  I really appreciate him coming on his busy schedule.
[03:00:14.399 --> 03:00:17.741]  I hope he'll come back for a full hour soon.
[03:00:17.741 --> 03:00:23.884]  I don't want to get back to myself, but I want to pick your brain because you're a smart guy.
[03:00:34.864 --> 03:00:40.950]  This purge against me, I think it was done because they wanted to set the precedent with me because they'd already demonized me, and then they would do it to everybody else.
[03:00:40.950 --> 03:00:42.251]  And sure enough, they've now done that.
[03:00:42.251 --> 03:00:44.273]  The President's vowing action.
[03:00:44.273 --> 03:00:47.455]  I've got a battle plan I've got with the President.
[03:00:47.455 --> 03:00:49.157]  My last plan got to him, that's one reason.
[03:00:49.157 --> 03:00:50.778]  They started the ban, they got so upset.
[03:00:51.559 --> 03:00:55.363]  But what else do you think is going on here and what do you expect them to do next?
[03:00:55.363 --> 03:01:00.489]  Because I agree 2020 is critical, but I think they could make the move before the election.
[03:01:00.489 --> 03:01:03.212]  I mean, they really want us blocked virally.
[03:01:03.212 --> 03:01:06.376]  I think when some big event happens, that's what my spirit tells me.
[03:01:08.533 --> 03:01:09.413]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:01:09.413 --> 03:01:13.996]  I mean, obviously, there's several things they could try to do, as we know.
[03:01:13.996 --> 03:01:15.457]  You know, I've warned about this.
[03:01:15.457 --> 03:01:25.182]  We did a one-hour documentary that we aired, actually, across America back in 2016, that they could do an EMP attack, knock out the grid, number one.
[03:01:25.182 --> 03:01:27.163]  Number two, they could collapse the dollar.
[03:01:27.603 --> 03:01:31.306]  Number three, you know, obviously they want race rights.
[03:01:31.306 --> 03:01:32.787]  They want problems.
[03:01:32.787 --> 03:01:34.288]  You know, they just want upheaval.
[03:01:34.288 --> 03:01:39.231]  So, I mean, the people behind the scenes, what people don't understand, they're wicked.
[03:01:39.231 --> 03:01:41.373]  They don't care about life.
[03:01:41.373 --> 03:01:44.415]  They don't care about people, even though they say that.
[03:01:44.415 --> 03:01:45.496]  It could be the death of
[03:01:45.896 --> 03:01:47.037]  Millions and millions of people.
[03:01:47.037 --> 03:01:48.238]  They don't really care.
[03:01:48.238 --> 03:01:49.980]  It's about the agenda.
[03:01:49.980 --> 03:01:55.986]  It's about the total agenda of the globalists, of the New World Order being pushed forward.
[03:01:55.986 --> 03:02:04.934]  So, we're dealing with a lot of situations whereby we've got still voter fraud, with the voting machines, when those things cannot be trusted.
[03:02:04.934 --> 03:02:07.857]  I'm just telling you right now, I don't care what anybody says,
[03:02:08.317 --> 03:02:15.340]  And then you have all the dead people that are voting, as they were voting in the 2016 election.
[03:02:15.340 --> 03:02:20.441]  So, I mean, you've got dead people, you've got more people in a precinct voting that actually live there.
[03:02:20.441 --> 03:02:23.062]  I mean, the corruption is at an all-time high.
[03:02:23.062 --> 03:02:25.443]  So, obviously, they don't want your voice, Alex.
[03:02:25.443 --> 03:02:27.324]  But, ultimately, they're not going to shut you down.
[03:02:27.324 --> 03:02:29.025]  They can't stop you.
[03:02:29.025 --> 03:02:29.905]  Truth will prevail.
[03:02:30.425 --> 03:02:40.391]  So, we understand the saying that, you know, a lie goes around the world before truth gets up and puts its pants on.
[03:02:40.391 --> 03:02:41.492]  A lie goes around the world.
[03:02:41.492 --> 03:02:42.313]  We understand that.
[03:02:42.313 --> 03:02:45.034]  But, ultimately, truth is going to prevail.
[03:02:45.034 --> 03:02:48.857]  And, the Bible says, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[03:02:48.857 --> 03:02:52.439]  So, that's why we pray for you, that God's about you as a wall of fire.
[03:02:52.439 --> 03:02:54.460]  No harm and evil will come nigh to you.
[03:02:54.460 --> 03:02:57.582]  And if the enemy digs a ditch for you, he's going to fall in it himself.
[03:02:57.922 --> 03:03:03.167]  And we pray the same way over the President, and we pray that God would unravel all of these things.
[03:03:03.167 --> 03:03:23.025]  However, Christians need to go vote, and they need to find out who they're voting for, and they need to hold them up against the Constitution and against the Word of God, and realize we can't vote for people that are under the control of the globalist New World Order agenda, because some of them have sold themselves out to the highest bidder.
[03:03:23.565 --> 03:03:30.349]  Unfortunately, Republican Party is as wicked as well, but we have no other alternative.
[03:03:30.349 --> 03:03:33.791]  So, it's kind of like better the devil you know than the devil you don't know.
[03:03:33.791 --> 03:03:38.434]  So, you know, make sure that everything stays in the hands of the Republican.
[03:03:38.434 --> 03:03:46.419]  Give us a little bit more time to turn this thing around, even though we understand that Deep State is everywhere and trying to control the narrative.
[03:03:47.579 --> 03:04:06.570]  I believe that God has some surprises for them, and I believe there's some things, even though they might plan to crash Wall Street by October, or whatever the plan is, that the Bible says, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of God will raise up a Senate against him.
[03:04:06.570 --> 03:04:09.052]  And so that's why the church needs to pray.
[03:04:09.052 --> 03:04:10.513]  Every believer needs to pray.
[03:04:10.513 --> 03:04:14.515]  That's why they want to get rid of real Christianity, because if we pray, we'll get the providence and they know that.
[03:04:16.317 --> 03:04:16.757]  Correct.
[03:04:16.757 --> 03:04:18.498]  But they can't stop us.
[03:04:18.498 --> 03:04:20.298]  It's too far gone, Alex.
[03:04:20.298 --> 03:04:21.939]  It'll never be stopped.
[03:04:21.939 --> 03:04:23.819]  God has given us a last minute... No, no, I agree.
[03:04:23.819 --> 03:04:25.420]  They seem panicked.
[03:04:25.420 --> 03:04:29.361]  The establishment seems genuinely freaked out.
[03:04:29.361 --> 03:04:29.721]  Totally.
[03:04:29.721 --> 03:04:31.822]  They're running around like a chicken with their head chopped off.
[03:04:32.821 --> 03:04:35.564]  Pray for the young evangelist in Newark.
[03:04:35.564 --> 03:04:37.606]  He's moved into the Symphony Hall.
[03:04:37.606 --> 03:04:40.188]  Tonight and tomorrow night will be the next two nights.
[03:04:40.188 --> 03:04:50.318]  And of course, he doesn't have the permit to do it outdoor, which that's the thing that speaks louder than anything you can imagine with 10,000 on open field.
[03:04:50.318 --> 03:04:51.539]  But I'm excited.
[03:04:51.539 --> 03:04:53.601]  I have an excitement in my spirit.
[03:04:53.601 --> 03:04:54.662]  Come back in 60 seconds.

[03:06:08.173 --> 03:06:13.441]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWars.
[03:06:22.489 --> 03:06:27.433]  All right, Doug Hagman of the Hagman Report has got massive breaking news as usual.
[03:06:27.433 --> 03:06:29.555]  Just every segment's incredible.
[03:06:29.555 --> 03:06:34.699]  You heard Jack Pasubic of Naval Intelligence, One American News Network, who has direct conduits into the President.
[03:06:34.699 --> 03:06:41.465]  I can tell you that right now, because I'm going to leave it at that, that they are planning to indict Don Jr.
[03:06:43.467 --> 03:06:43.847]  For nothing.
[03:07:14.048 --> 03:07:21.903]  And they have Washington Post, New York Times, Buzzfeed reporters, and then their minions come, and I can't even make the faces of hate.
[03:07:21.903 --> 03:07:22.965]  When they look at me, they go...
[03:07:26.340 --> 03:07:30.724]  And they have this rage that is insane and isn't based in reality.
[03:07:30.724 --> 03:07:32.185]  And they're all alone.
[03:07:32.185 --> 03:07:33.587]  They all hate each other.
[03:07:33.587 --> 03:07:40.072]  And statistically, they're nine times more likely to not give to charity, six times more likely to steal, liberals are.
[03:07:40.072 --> 03:07:40.853]  They're not liberals.
[03:07:40.853 --> 03:07:44.216]  They're just these monstrous, unhappy, turned-over people.
[03:07:44.216 --> 03:07:49.341]  And it's like, as God's spirit is stronger in us, the spirit of the world, the devil,
[03:07:50.492 --> 03:07:50.632]  Yes.
[03:08:03.260 --> 03:08:04.741]  Or my camera guy said, I don't want to be out here anymore.
[03:08:04.741 --> 03:08:06.502]  He said, I'm not even scaring people, they're like zombies.
[03:08:06.502 --> 03:08:14.408]  We walk around one corner, there'd be normal people, but then you'd see one person walking normal, and they'd see me, and like, something would jump in, and they'd be like, and all of a sudden, HA!
[03:08:14.408 --> 03:08:17.090]  You'll go down, Jones, and your family, and screw your children!
[03:08:17.090 --> 03:08:21.893]  And then like, it was like, right out of, uh, something like The Exorcist.
[03:08:21.893 --> 03:08:24.675]  And then you go around another corner, and be like, yeah, that's right, we're gonna get ya!
[03:08:24.675 --> 03:08:31.921]  And it was like, they were finishing each other's sentences, like, the demon's going out of the, you know, people, and into the pigs, and off the cliff, and,
[03:08:33.072 --> 03:08:42.921]  I mean, I've seen things in Seattle and a few other areas, like San Francisco, where it's like Agent Smith and the Matrix, where he jumps in one person and jumps in another and jumps in another and jumps in another.
[03:08:42.921 --> 03:08:44.462]  And I'm not, I mean, I'm not kidding.
[03:08:44.462 --> 03:08:46.224]  What happened to like five or six people?
[03:08:46.224 --> 03:08:48.446]  Michael Zimmerman was there and he said, listen, we got to get out of here.
[03:08:48.446 --> 03:08:49.527]  This place is evil.
[03:08:49.527 --> 03:08:52.509]  I mean, it was like, it was like the Matrix.
[03:08:52.509 --> 03:08:52.890]  Go ahead.
[03:08:52.890 --> 03:08:53.130]  Sorry.
[03:08:55.012 --> 03:08:59.695]  No, I mean, we're living in a time where people are being demonized.
[03:08:59.695 --> 03:09:04.018]  That's why the church has been given the power to cast out devils.
[03:09:04.018 --> 03:09:10.022]  And so, unfortunately, the churches don't even believe in devils, and some of the preachers carry them as well.
[03:09:10.022 --> 03:09:11.623]  Some people carry passengers.
[03:09:11.623 --> 03:09:14.945]  They look like a bus loaded with passengers, and that's just one person.
[03:09:15.405 --> 03:09:22.891]  It's like the man of Gadara that had a legion on the inside of him, and Jesus cast him out, winded the swine.
[03:09:22.891 --> 03:09:29.036]  So we have to have the power of God to get people delivered from the demonic lives of the enemy.
[03:09:29.036 --> 03:09:31.899]  These people, they're not even thinking straight, Alex.
[03:09:32.399 --> 03:09:35.501]  I mean, the whole thing is messed up, man.
[03:09:35.501 --> 03:09:38.243]  And, you know, but that's why we have to carry on preaching the truth.
[03:09:38.243 --> 03:09:43.907]  And the fact of the matter is, you know, when Jesus, when they came to grab him, he walked through the crowd.
[03:09:43.907 --> 03:09:46.248]  He just went, they tried to throw him over a cliff.
[03:09:46.248 --> 03:09:47.910]  He just went through the crowd.
[03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:52.292]  So the fact of the matter, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[03:09:52.292 --> 03:09:56.655]  And so, as I said, if they dig a ditch for you, they're falling in themselves.
[03:09:56.655 --> 03:10:00.418]  And I tell you, the only way forward is by the power of the Holy Spirit.
[03:10:01.135 --> 03:10:05.999]  Whether people believe it or not, I'm talking to Christians even in churches.
[03:10:05.999 --> 03:10:08.440]  Some people say, we don't believe in this Holy Spirit.
[03:10:08.440 --> 03:10:10.562]  Well, I'm telling you, you're not going to make it.
[03:10:10.562 --> 03:10:13.003]  You will not make it without the power of the Holy Spirit.
[03:10:13.003 --> 03:10:21.690]  Because it's only the Holy Ghost that will be able to surround you, protect you, and to keep you just like Jesus until His time was to go to the cross.
[03:10:21.690 --> 03:10:23.571]  They could not touch Him.
[03:10:23.571 --> 03:10:25.892]  They could not touch Him.
[03:10:25.892 --> 03:10:26.193]  And so,
[03:10:26.873 --> 03:10:34.856]  We have to understand, Psalm 91, He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
[03:10:34.856 --> 03:10:39.498]  I'll save the Lord, He's my refuge, my fortress, my God, in Him will I trust.
[03:10:39.498 --> 03:10:43.380]  So, He's given His angels charge over us to keep us in all our ways.
[03:10:43.980 --> 03:10:47.563]  And so, the fact of the matter is that the Lord is with us.
[03:10:47.563 --> 03:11:00.335]  The stories go down through the centuries of people that were exposed to situations whereby they could die, but because the Lord was on their side, no evil could prevail against them.
[03:11:00.815 --> 03:11:02.276]  So I want to encourage you.
[03:11:02.276 --> 03:11:04.016]  I want to encourage everybody out there.
[03:11:04.016 --> 03:11:06.257]  Yes, these are scary days.
[03:11:06.257 --> 03:11:08.878]  These are days of upheaval.
[03:11:08.878 --> 03:11:11.800]  No different as they were five years ago or ten years ago.
[03:11:11.800 --> 03:11:17.562]  Personally, I'm much happier to be living in 2018 than in the year 1412.
[03:11:17.562 --> 03:11:20.243]  So we have a lot of things at our fingertips.
[03:11:20.243 --> 03:11:22.084]  We have the ability to speak around the world.
[03:11:22.897 --> 03:11:24.799]  And reach millions of people.
[03:11:24.799 --> 03:11:32.045]  Way back, 200 years ago, we'd have to saddle up and ride and cry, you know, like a crier in the town.
[03:11:32.045 --> 03:11:35.808]  Yeah he, yeah he, you know, to give that kind of announcement.
[03:11:35.808 --> 03:11:38.190]  We have so many tools at our fingertips.
[03:11:38.190 --> 03:11:39.111]  We have the technology.
[03:11:39.111 --> 03:11:41.092]  Pastor Brown, you're amazing.
[03:11:41.092 --> 03:11:41.853]  Thank you so much.
[03:11:41.853 --> 03:11:46.397]  The book, The Killing of Uncle Sam, available at mfulworthstore.com and killingunclesambook.com.
[03:11:46.397 --> 03:11:47.998]  I don't care where you get it, folks, just get it.
[03:11:47.998 --> 03:11:48.599]  God bless you, sir.
[03:11:50.490 --> 03:11:51.271]  Alex, we love you.
[03:11:51.271 --> 03:11:51.691]  Bless you.
[03:11:51.691 --> 03:11:52.231]  We love you, too.
[03:11:52.231 --> 03:11:53.632]  What a great guy, I tell you.
[03:11:53.632 --> 03:11:59.935]  You can really feel the Holy Spirit on him strong when you're around him in person, especially.
[03:11:59.935 --> 03:12:01.656]  It's overwhelming.
[03:12:01.656 --> 03:12:10.501]  I want to turn this over to Doug Hagman of the Hagman Report, a police trainer, private detective, best-selling author, really great guy who helped expose what was in the WikiLeaks and so much more.
[03:12:10.501 --> 03:12:12.202]  I want to go to him and have him take over.
[03:12:12.202 --> 03:12:14.043]  He's getting massively censored just briefly here.
[03:12:14.043 --> 03:12:18.266]  Maybe later he can plug, but if you don't finance us, if you don't financially support us,
[03:12:19.560 --> 03:12:24.421]  And if you don't go by the products, which I know you're doing, but it needs to be a lot of folks have been on the fence.
[03:12:24.421 --> 03:12:32.163]  If you don't go get Knockout, great natural sleep formula, 40% off right now, our ultimate bone broth, 50% off out of the gates, $19.95, can't beat that.
[03:12:32.163 --> 03:12:34.383]  Our Real Red Pill Plus, now with energy.
[03:12:34.383 --> 03:12:38.384]  If you don't get a book, a t-shirt, we won't be here.
[03:12:38.384 --> 03:12:39.344]  I mean, it's that simple.
[03:12:39.344 --> 03:12:41.885]  They're trying to shut us down, but they're trying to shut everybody down.
[03:12:42.165 --> 03:12:49.950]  Doug, I'm going to let you take over because you're host of the show and I want to hear what you have to say, but just briefly, picking your brain, I know you've been censored, you've got a lot coming up, because they're doing this to everybody.
[03:12:49.950 --> 03:12:57.574]  I think they use me as a smoke screen being de-platformed to just make it all about me because it's been Night of the Long Knives, man.
[03:12:57.574 --> 03:13:09.521]  They have been just purging people from Prager University to you, just an absolute reign of terror, A, ahead of the midterms, but also I think ahead of a big event they're going to stage where they don't want us on air to counter it.
[03:13:13.186 --> 03:13:14.047]  Let's turn this mic on.
[03:13:14.047 --> 03:13:14.888]  Thanks, guys.
[03:13:14.888 --> 03:13:16.069]  Maybe it's not... There we go.
[03:13:16.069 --> 03:13:16.409]  That was me.
[03:13:16.409 --> 03:13:17.070]  Okay, go ahead.
[03:13:17.070 --> 03:13:18.511]  All right.
[03:13:18.511 --> 03:13:20.733]  I didn't want to believe that, but I do believe that now.
[03:13:20.733 --> 03:13:35.506]  Yeah, in fact, I've got to say that everything I've been hearing, there's some sort of event being planned ahead in the midterms, especially if the polling, which they've got rigged as well, suggests that there won't be a blue wave.
[03:13:35.506 --> 03:13:38.409]  It'll be a red plague, shall we say.
[03:13:39.269 --> 03:13:40.090]  We're good to go.
[03:13:52.398 --> 03:13:59.825]  The value combined within 12 hours of one another, conspiring together just to de-platform you.
[03:13:59.825 --> 03:14:04.009]  And to me, that's incredible and that certainly is not coincidental.
[03:14:04.009 --> 03:14:13.858]  But if you consider $2.4 trillion combined value of these four companies, Apple, Google, Facebook, and so on, you're looking at the seventh largest
[03:14:16.059 --> 03:14:18.606]  Sovereign power in terms of GDP.
[03:14:18.606 --> 03:14:24.239]  It's an extremely bold and reckless move showing they're committed to something and don't want us on air for some big event.
[03:14:25.240 --> 03:14:26.241]  Yeah, exactly.
[03:14:26.241 --> 03:14:30.563]  So, I mean, you know, of course, I'm a big, I ask a lot of questions.
[03:14:30.563 --> 03:14:31.544]  For example, why?
[03:14:31.544 --> 03:14:32.164]  Why now?
[03:14:32.164 --> 03:14:32.925]  Why now?
[03:14:32.925 --> 03:14:34.606]  Why you?
[03:14:34.606 --> 03:14:38.008]  Obviously you because you've got the largest platform out there.
[03:14:38.008 --> 03:14:39.449]  But why now specifically?
[03:14:39.449 --> 03:14:40.850]  They could have done this six months ago.
[03:14:40.850 --> 03:14:42.310]  They could have done this five months ago.
[03:14:42.310 --> 03:14:43.511]  But why now?
[03:14:43.511 --> 03:14:45.913]  And I think we have to pay attention to the news that
[03:14:46.733 --> 03:14:49.794]  No, just right after.
[03:14:49.794 --> 03:15:03.937]  Everything that's coming forward right now, in particular what you spoke about earlier with Jack Posobiec, the indictment, potential indictment of Donald Trump Jr., which I've gotten independent of Jack Posobiec, I think we've got different sources.
[03:15:03.937 --> 03:15:07.838]  Yeah, and it's going to be bad.
[03:15:07.838 --> 03:15:10.659]  Things that are coming, it's going to be bad.
[03:15:10.659 --> 03:15:12.259]  I think Trump's going to take the gloves off.
[03:15:13.496 --> 03:15:15.097]  He's got to.
[03:15:15.097 --> 03:15:15.817]  What else?
[03:15:15.817 --> 03:15:20.139]  I mean, what other options does he have?
[03:15:20.139 --> 03:15:28.702]  And by the way, I don't know if you just heard this, it was my understanding that we've got maybe a visit by the Attorney General to the White House here today?
[03:15:28.702 --> 03:15:28.922]  Yes.
[03:15:28.922 --> 03:15:29.842]  You heard that?
[03:15:29.842 --> 03:15:30.102]  Okay.
[03:15:33.758 --> 03:15:34.579]  We'll look into that.
[03:15:34.579 --> 03:15:35.200]  I didn't see that.
[03:15:35.200 --> 03:15:37.143]  We'll come back and talk about that right now.
[03:15:37.143 --> 03:15:40.187]  But yeah, the Attorney General needs to be thrown out on his butt.
[03:15:40.187 --> 03:15:43.010]  I mean, I don't know how they compromised him or what happened to him.
[03:15:43.010 --> 03:15:46.635]  Or he's senile or, you know, what do they got him in a KKK outfit?
[03:15:46.635 --> 03:15:47.396]  I don't know what the deal is.
[03:15:47.396 --> 03:15:48.437]  We'll be back with Doug Hagman.
[03:15:48.437 --> 03:15:48.898]  Stay with us.
[03:15:48.898 --> 03:15:50.120]  His son's coming up too.
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:51.722]  He helps with the broadcast and co-hosts.

[03:16:53.268 --> 03:16:54.509]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:16:54.509 --> 03:16:58.431]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:16:58.431 --> 03:16:59.972]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:16:59.972 --> 03:17:02.933]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:02.933 --> 03:17:08.136]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:08.476 --> 03:17:09.677]  I can help you too.
[03:17:09.677 --> 03:17:12.600]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:12.600 --> 03:17:14.822]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:14.822 --> 03:17:19.266]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, DanPilla.com.
[03:17:19.266 --> 03:17:20.968]  That's DanPilla.com.

[03:17:23.370 --> 03:17:26.832]  You know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the U.S.
[03:17:26.832 --> 03:17:31.816]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month you could fight against heart disease naturally?
[03:17:31.816 --> 03:17:36.640]  At Heart and Body Extract, we've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.
[03:17:36.640 --> 03:17:38.001]  Don't just take my word for it.

[03:17:43.124 --> 03:17:43.685]  HBExtract.com.
[03:17:43.685 --> 03:17:45.986]  Don't risk it when you can take charge of it.
[03:17:54.011 --> 03:17:58.132]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[03:17:58.132 --> 03:18:05.213]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower, and sink in your home.
[03:18:05.213 --> 03:18:10.014]  That's why we're bringing you something to provide clean water for your whole house with one system.
[03:18:10.014 --> 03:18:17.756]  The ProPure Whole House Water Filtration System is an advanced, four-stage, compact filtration system that will provide
[03:18:17.756 --> 03:18:23.359]  Provide water filtration for your entire home, removing 220 plus contaminants from your water.
[03:18:23.359 --> 03:18:32.943]  It's compact in size, easy to install and maintain, and keeps fluoride and other dangerous toxins out of your water supply and away from you and your family.
[03:18:32.943 --> 03:18:40.027]  With its broad spectrum contaminant reduction, you'll only need this one filter for clean and refreshing water all over your home.
[03:18:40.387 --> 03:18:50.733]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.
[03:19:04.520 --> 03:19:06.603]  That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[03:19:06.603 --> 03:19:09.468]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support.
[03:19:09.468 --> 03:19:10.950]  It's made in the USA.
[03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:17.781]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the info war.
[03:19:17.781 --> 03:19:19.043]  It is a classical 360 wind.
[03:19:19.844 --> 03:19:29.552]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year, and now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:29.552 --> 03:19:46.384]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be, because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brushfires to the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:46.384 --> 03:19:49.547]  Thanks to your support and your prayers, together, we're changing the world.
[03:19:49.667 --> 03:19:57.150]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Field at InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:19:57.150 --> 03:19:59.791]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:17.106 --> 03:20:19.707]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:19.707 --> 03:20:21.227]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:20:21.227 --> 03:20:25.128]  Alright, Doug Hagman's taking over, but I love talking to him.
[03:20:25.128 --> 03:20:26.529]  And his son's coming up as well.
[03:20:26.529 --> 03:20:31.370]  A lot of key information, but... I wanted this morning when I got here to thank the audience up front.
[03:20:31.370 --> 03:20:37.592]  I always get distracted with them trying to shut down all our other channels, and other people I know's channels, and... Just the insanity going on.
[03:20:37.592 --> 03:20:38.732]  It's totally crazy, but...
[03:20:39.875 --> 03:20:41.315]  I want to thank the listeners and viewers.
[03:20:41.315 --> 03:20:44.476]  I know I get on there and say, help me, help me, help us, help us.
[03:20:44.476 --> 03:20:46.037]  But you can see now we're front and center.
[03:20:46.037 --> 03:20:47.197]  I mean, I already knew we were front and center.
[03:20:47.197 --> 03:20:48.638]  I already knew they were trying to destroy us.
[03:20:48.638 --> 03:20:52.339]  I already knew I was, you know, giving information to patriots and stuff.
[03:20:52.339 --> 03:20:54.780]  And there's a lot of things people don't know.
[03:20:54.780 --> 03:20:55.880]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:20:55.880 --> 03:21:08.504]  But believe me, at the Pentagon and in the Marine Corps and the Army and other places, without Trump even trying, in the classes and special operations and in all the groups they are,
[03:21:09.448 --> 03:21:11.069]  They're finding out all this stuff.
[03:21:11.069 --> 03:21:12.609]  They now know it's true.
[03:21:12.609 --> 03:21:15.670]  They're having a crash course in the New World Order.
[03:21:15.670 --> 03:21:18.311]  Trump, they, I mean, it's, it's, let me tell you something.
[03:21:18.311 --> 03:21:24.774]  Let me tell you, America is awake and that's when the left's moving to shut everything down because they're not going to get away with it.
[03:21:24.774 --> 03:21:30.196]  And later today, Thursday afternoon is not the best time to launch something, but I got this a day ago.
[03:21:30.196 --> 03:21:32.417]  I got the sources that I know are getting it to the president.
[03:21:32.417 --> 03:21:33.617]  The word is they already got it to him.
[03:21:33.617 --> 03:21:34.557]  I don't know if he's read it yet.
[03:21:34.557 --> 03:21:37.799]  We need to flood the world with this.
[03:21:37.799 --> 03:21:38.759]  And so I'll tell you what I'll do.
[03:21:42.441 --> 03:21:50.394]  I'm going to shoot a live report on Periscope at 3 o'clock with this because I get something that's powerful.
[03:21:52.665 --> 03:21:54.447]  I've been consulting with three different big law firms.
[03:21:54.447 --> 03:21:57.851]  One of them is a top Republican law firm.
[03:21:57.851 --> 03:22:02.296]  And I went to them and I said, I said, they've already done some work for me.
[03:22:02.296 --> 03:22:04.178]  And I said, I want you to look at all this.
[03:22:04.178 --> 03:22:05.420]  And they said, oh, absolutely.
[03:22:05.420 --> 03:22:08.163]  And I've got other law firms that want to sue, antitrust, you name it.
[03:22:08.163 --> 03:22:08.984]  They looked at it.
[03:22:08.984 --> 03:22:11.627]  We have a battle plan for the president.
[03:22:11.627 --> 03:22:13.349]  I know he's formulating a battle plan right now.
[03:22:14.566 --> 03:22:17.909]  But most people are scared to form a battle plan against Big Tech and Shycom.
[03:22:17.909 --> 03:22:19.310]  Because they know it's a death sentence.
[03:22:19.310 --> 03:22:21.292]  Well, it's a death sentence getting into this.
[03:22:21.292 --> 03:22:28.498]  So, at 3 o'clock, I will do a live feed at Infowars.com on all of this.
[03:22:28.498 --> 03:22:31.140]  And it's not like, I'm like, ooh, I've got a big breaking story.
[03:22:31.140 --> 03:22:35.644]  When you get stuff this powerful and this historic, I don't want to say I get butterflies.
[03:22:35.644 --> 03:22:39.687]  Instead it feels like a thousand pound rocks on your head, like Atlas.
[03:22:40.948 --> 03:22:42.210]  Man, it's up to us.
[03:22:42.210 --> 03:22:44.412]  But I'm telling you, listeners, I appreciate you and I thank you.
[03:22:44.412 --> 03:22:51.319]  So when I'm telling you, please help us, please help us, it's because I want to win, and I want to drive over the top, and I need you, and I love you, and I appreciate you.
[03:22:51.319 --> 03:23:00.389]  No matter what color you are, or where you came from, or if you love liberty, you love freedom, and you spiritually feel what's happening, and you want to go to the next level, we're together, brothers and sisters in arms.
[03:23:00.389 --> 03:23:01.190]  So Doug, thank you.
[03:23:01.190 --> 03:23:02.712]  Go ahead and take over, and God bless you.
[03:23:04.056 --> 03:23:20.208]  Thank you, Alex, and I can speak for all of us here at the Hagman Report and the various people that we, some mutual friends and others, that we stand behind you, we love you, and we will back you 100%, and that's not just talk.
[03:23:20.208 --> 03:23:20.549]  Thank you.
[03:23:20.549 --> 03:23:21.289]  Thank you, Alex.
[03:23:21.289 --> 03:23:22.050]  I back you too, brother.
[03:23:22.611 --> 03:23:22.811]  Alright.
[03:23:22.811 --> 03:23:29.118]  We're going to be tuning into, of course, 3 o'clock Central Time, 4 o'clock Eastern Time, Periscope.
[03:23:29.118 --> 03:23:35.605]  Make sure you catch that, because I have a feeling, I think I know, I kind of know, but I really don't know.
[03:23:36.329 --> 03:23:42.312]  But if I know Alex Jones, I know that it's going to be well worth your time to listen.
[03:23:42.312 --> 03:23:47.154]  Again, that's 3 o'clock Central, 4 o'clock Eastern, Periscope, Breaking News with Alex Jones.
[03:23:47.154 --> 03:23:48.515]  All right.
[03:23:48.515 --> 03:23:53.198]  Sitting in for Alex Jones here, and I want to say thank you to everyone out there as well.
[03:23:53.198 --> 03:24:01.802]  Look, we're on the firing line, too, and there's a number of topics I want to get into during this hour that I'm going to be sitting in for Alex Jones and hosting.
[03:24:02.843 --> 03:24:05.809]  First let me say this, please support the operation.
[03:24:05.809 --> 03:24:11.060]  Alex Jones will not, I mean he talks about the products but he doesn't talk necessarily about
[03:24:12.069 --> 03:24:18.311]  How much, to the penny, the operation is really sinking him, costing him, I should say.
[03:24:18.311 --> 03:24:20.011]  It's a big cost.
[03:24:20.011 --> 03:24:24.832]  And I know our platform costs a lot of money, so please support InfoWars.
[03:24:24.832 --> 03:24:27.353]  Go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:27.353 --> 03:24:33.815]  Get all of your health products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:24:33.815 --> 03:24:38.056]  Do it today, because it helps InfoWars, it helps fund the operation.
[03:24:38.736 --> 03:24:39.937]  But most importantly, it helps you.
[03:24:39.937 --> 03:24:41.398]  DNA Force Plus.
[03:24:41.398 --> 03:24:54.868]  I'm going to tell you, some of these products, I have not been able to try them all, but some of them, including the One For Focus, yeah, as I stumble over that, works very well.
[03:24:54.868 --> 03:24:57.990]  The Alpha Male Pack, tremendous.
[03:24:57.990 --> 03:24:59.411]  Brain Force Plus.
[03:24:59.411 --> 03:25:00.772]  I'm going to tell you, that's a great product.
[03:25:00.772 --> 03:25:05.115]  I don't know what... I mean, I do know what they put into it, but it really works extremely well.
[03:25:05.115 --> 03:25:06.396]  By the way, it's on sale right now for $29.95.
[03:25:08.037 --> 03:25:11.680]  I've seen it offered at places for three or four times that.
[03:25:11.680 --> 03:25:19.327]  It's a similar product, but it's got just a number of great, powerful ingredients, of course, in Brain Force Plus.
[03:25:19.327 --> 03:25:20.568]  There it is on the screen.
[03:25:20.568 --> 03:25:23.871]  So, folks, please support InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:25:23.871 --> 03:25:26.553]  Do it, and we're going to fight this fight together.
[03:25:26.553 --> 03:25:27.394]  So, all right.
[03:25:29.584 --> 03:25:36.247]  As I mentioned, and I'm going to ask Joe, my son, we have the Hagman Report.
[03:25:36.247 --> 03:25:39.048]  In case you don't know, folks, I'm just going to tell you real quick.
[03:25:39.048 --> 03:25:43.110]  HagmanReport.com is where, that's my home base.
[03:25:43.110 --> 03:25:46.352]  And we have a show Monday through Friday, 7 to 10 p.m.
[03:25:46.352 --> 03:25:46.592]  Eastern.
[03:25:47.390 --> 03:25:48.150]  Oh, it was interesting.
[03:25:48.150 --> 03:25:50.211]  I'm in the beginning of this here momentarily.
[03:25:50.211 --> 03:25:50.832]  It was interesting.
[03:25:50.832 --> 03:26:00.056]  It was on Tuesday morning when we received a notice from YouTube, which is one of many platforms on which we broadcast.
[03:26:00.056 --> 03:26:04.018]  We broadcast via satellite on other platforms as well.
[03:26:04.018 --> 03:26:09.661]  But we received a notice Tuesday morning that we were in violation.
[03:26:09.661 --> 03:26:11.361]  We got a copy, or not a copyright, but a
[03:26:13.337 --> 03:26:15.061]  What is that video?
[03:26:15.061 --> 03:26:16.303]  Community Guidelines.
[03:26:16.303 --> 03:26:18.147]  That's how they're banning everybody.
[03:26:18.147 --> 03:26:18.968]  Wow, a voice.
[03:26:18.968 --> 03:26:19.309]  Okay.
[03:26:19.309 --> 03:26:20.251]  They're purging everyone.
[03:26:20.251 --> 03:26:20.652]  No, I know.
[03:26:20.652 --> 03:26:21.654]  They're purging everyone.
[03:26:21.654 --> 03:26:22.075]  It's criminal.
[03:26:22.884 --> 03:26:43.453]  Alright, so we got that, and you know what Mr. Jones had said, Alex Jones said this, that they take away your ability to even show that you didn't do what they said you did, but they don't tell you what you did, but you can't respond because they take down the video and block you from preventing, or prevent you from putting it back up, so that's that.
[03:26:43.453 --> 03:26:47.675]  And then I got, there was additional, the appeal, we appealed it.
[03:26:48.616 --> 03:26:51.178]  Uh, and ask them for additional information.
[03:26:51.178 --> 03:26:54.141]  Within 10 hours, we were declined.
[03:26:54.141 --> 03:26:57.425]  Now, the appeal process usually takes several days.
[03:26:57.425 --> 03:26:58.766]  And, uh, there's nothing there.
[03:26:58.766 --> 03:26:59.988]  So, we're... Oh, you're right.
[03:26:59.988 --> 03:27:01.889]  When they do the real appeals, it might take two weeks.
[03:27:01.889 --> 03:27:04.092]  Now, we do appeals instantly denied.
[03:27:04.827 --> 03:27:06.208]  Exactly, exactly.
[03:27:06.208 --> 03:27:10.212]  As a matter of fact, I think it could have been 10 minutes.
[03:27:10.212 --> 03:27:15.617]  We didn't check it because we didn't expect anything for a number of days.
[03:27:15.617 --> 03:27:21.162]  In fact, we were told that we were next and we were going to be deplatformed across all of the social networking.
[03:27:21.902 --> 03:27:29.788]  And the fighting back, and again, I can't wait for your four o'clock periscope, three o'clock central time, because I want to see what you've got planned.
[03:27:29.788 --> 03:27:40.496]  I think the fight is there, and I think the president needs to step in, given the fact that this is the most, well, YouTube, in the case of YouTube, the most monopolistic visual medium.
[03:27:40.496 --> 03:27:49.663]  Now, there are other platforms out there, but this is the most monopolistic, and you're talking about the 1850 Sherman Antitrust Act, which could be applicable here.
[03:27:50.323 --> 03:28:03.679]  And I think that it would behoove people to remember that a lot of the Defense Department money went into, for example, the creation of Facebook.
[03:28:03.679 --> 03:28:07.723]  It didn't start in Zuckerberg's garage, for example, or dorm room.
[03:28:11.627 --> 03:28:15.568]  Germinated there, but it was helped along the way with taxpayer money.
[03:28:15.568 --> 03:28:23.550]  So, could we be looking at a Sherman Antitrust Act situation, like a Ma Bell situation?
[03:28:23.550 --> 03:28:26.391]  Some people say, well wait a second, that's not it.
[03:28:26.391 --> 03:28:28.831]  That's not, because it's a private platform.
[03:28:28.831 --> 03:28:30.612]  But folks, rethink that idea.
[03:28:30.612 --> 03:28:32.712]  Doug Hagman sending it for Alex Jones.
[03:28:32.712 --> 03:28:34.712]  Remember, InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:28:34.712 --> 03:28:36.033]  Going to be right back after this break.
[03:28:36.033 --> 03:28:36.453]  Stay with us.
[03:28:38.900 --> 03:28:41.905]  Remember to support Doug Hagman, too, and his great books at the Hagman Report, folks.
[03:28:41.905 --> 03:28:43.027]  We're all under attack.
[03:28:43.027 --> 03:28:43.608]  You're under attack.
[03:28:43.608 --> 03:28:45.471]  We're taking your free speech right now.

[03:28:47.294 --> 03:28:48.215]  Big events coming up.

[03:28:53.163 --> 03:28:56.605]  I tried other brands, but I came back to my Sunshine.

[03:28:59.446 --> 03:29:01.347]  Get a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:01.347 --> 03:29:06.390]  Sometimes, life can be a pain in the neck, or back, or shoulder.
[03:29:06.390 --> 03:29:09.692]  And the best relief for that pain is a Sunny Bay Heating Pad.
[03:29:09.692 --> 03:29:15.955]  Did you know that the American College of Physicians said that one of the best ways to treat muscle pain is heat therapy?

[03:30:01.768 --> 03:30:02.249]  It's you!
[03:30:03.348 --> 03:30:05.549]  That has defeated Hillary and the globalists.
[03:30:05.549 --> 03:30:14.273]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet, that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure, that stood against the threats, that have now changed the world.
[03:30:14.273 --> 03:30:18.835]  And that's why you've been on the team, supporting us, praying for us, and spreading the word.
[03:30:18.835 --> 03:30:20.295]  You are the info war.
[03:30:20.295 --> 03:30:23.817]  And now, because of their intensifying censorship, it's more important than ever

[03:32:56.588 --> 03:32:59.211]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:15.131 --> 03:33:19.616]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:31.759 --> 03:33:33.040]  And this is InfoWars.
[03:33:33.040 --> 03:33:34.820]  Doug Hagman sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:33:34.820 --> 03:33:37.802]  I'll tell you what, Alex saved my bacon just a couple seconds ago.
[03:33:37.802 --> 03:33:39.002]  Dust on my lapel.
[03:33:39.002 --> 03:33:43.324]  But also, if you noticed that last segment, I was about 15 seconds off.
[03:33:43.324 --> 03:33:52.108]  Now, bear in mind, bear in mind, look, okay, I might not be the brightest bulb in the bunch, but I've got this time clock or this clock that's probably, I don't know,
[03:33:58.684 --> 03:34:13.674]  And, uh, you know, it's kind of down for me, in other words, due to the break and such, but of course, uh, Alex saved my bacon by, uh, apparently I'm looking at the numbers and I, I, I'll be working on my alphabet tomorrow and my numbers today.
[03:34:13.674 --> 03:34:16.716]  I was looking at the numbers and I had, I don't know, 14 seconds to spare.
[03:34:16.716 --> 03:34:18.217]  So Alex came in and saved me.
[03:34:18.217 --> 03:34:21.699]  So, well, I just enjoy sitting back and have my lunch and listen to you.
[03:34:21.699 --> 03:34:22.960]  So get, get into your show, man.
[03:34:22.960 --> 03:34:23.561]  I'm sorry.
[03:34:23.561 --> 03:34:25.502]  I've grabbed 20 minutes of the broadcast, Doug.
[03:34:25.502 --> 03:34:26.663]  No, I love it, man.
[03:34:26.663 --> 03:34:27.683]  I love it.
[03:34:27.683 --> 03:34:28.344]  A couple of things.
[03:34:28.524 --> 03:34:28.650]  Yeah.
[03:34:30.822 --> 03:34:41.105]  You know, Alex was talking about, of course, the censorship and the larger plan for censorship and, of course, showing the Democracy Matters, the media matters for America.
[03:34:41.105 --> 03:34:51.928]  This document here, a series of pages from a June 21st, 2016 meeting in Turnberry, Florida, an island down there in Florida.
[03:34:51.928 --> 03:34:58.750]  David Brock and the House Share Blue crew and a number of other agencies, NGOs are coming together.
[03:34:59.330 --> 03:34:59.510]  Yes.
[03:35:19.990 --> 03:35:31.987]  of Alex Jones and free speech, and us and free speech, and really, really want to, really believe that speech should be free, not banned.
[03:35:31.987 --> 03:35:35.653]  There should be no capricious banning across the social network platforms.
[03:35:36.737 --> 03:35:38.879]  Whether it be us or whoever.
[03:35:38.879 --> 03:35:45.504]  Notice, however, that Antifa, the hate of the left, is never censored.
[03:35:45.504 --> 03:35:47.725]  It's never tempered by anyone.
[03:35:47.725 --> 03:35:49.447]  It's only amplified.
[03:35:49.447 --> 03:35:56.292]  So on one end, they censor, they ban, they take away the platforms of Infowars.
[03:35:56.292 --> 03:36:01.075]  On the other side, they amplify the left, the propagandists of the left.
[03:36:01.075 --> 03:36:01.796]  And they do this
[03:36:02.552 --> 03:36:11.000]  They've been doing this now with aggressive, this aggressive approach, and it's really affected everything.
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:12.701]  Now they're going after the revenue.
[03:36:12.701 --> 03:36:14.123]  They're going after the stores.
[03:36:14.123 --> 03:36:19.147]  They're going after the payment gateways, whether it's MasterCard or Visa.
[03:36:19.147 --> 03:36:24.412]  They're taking away the ability for ease of process of payment.
[03:36:24.412 --> 03:36:28.716]  That will come, that's already here, but that will become more prevalent in the coming days.
[03:36:29.366 --> 03:36:41.595]  It's all part of, it's all, it's all outlined by David Brock, Media Matters, and of course his boyfriend, James Aliphantis, and other luminaries funded by Soros, of course, and other monies on the, on the left.
[03:36:41.595 --> 03:36:48.801]  And this would have been a lot quicker coming, I believe, in the days of Clinton, should she, should she have won.
[03:36:48.801 --> 03:36:56.367]  So, but when I asked, what I wanted to do was I wanted to bring my son Joe on because he, he was, what he's been doing, he's been doing an investigation.
[03:36:57.568 --> 03:37:02.631]  On the other side, or on the back side of what we're seeing.
[03:37:02.631 --> 03:37:05.593]  And he's got some information through his investigation.
[03:37:05.593 --> 03:37:15.200]  He's done hours upon hours of investigation about shadowbanning, about the platforms affected, about the... just any number of things.
[03:37:15.200 --> 03:37:16.861]  Joe, thanks for coming on with me, man.
[03:37:16.861 --> 03:37:20.383]  I know it's cutting in your day, time off, but hey.
[03:37:20.383 --> 03:37:21.004]  And by the way...
[03:37:22.173 --> 03:37:23.914]  Yeah, what's that, right?
[03:37:23.914 --> 03:37:28.075]  We do a show together, this is my son, we do a show together, Monday through Friday, 7 to 10 p.m.
[03:37:28.075 --> 03:37:29.816]  Eastern Time.
[03:37:29.816 --> 03:37:49.844]  After you get done watching Alex Jones' InfoWars, go to HagmanReport.com, watch us there, because we can't livestream on, just like Alex Jones' InfoWars can't livestream on YouTube, so we had to set up our own server, and we broadcast off our own website, this is our own dime, it's expensive, bandwidth is usually expensive.
[03:37:52.245 --> 03:37:54.366]  Yeah, what have you specifically?
[03:37:54.366 --> 03:37:59.409]  I really haven't covered a lot with regard to the specifics.
[03:37:59.409 --> 03:38:05.993]  Yeah, this document, the ban, it does tie into the document you have there.
[03:38:05.993 --> 03:38:06.714]  It's a, you know,
[03:38:07.811 --> 03:38:11.355]  Media playbook, really, to censor alternative and other media.
[03:38:11.355 --> 03:38:24.410]  And if you look at the language in this publication, they use words like we're going to punish, we're going to harass, we're going to delegitimize and basically come after anybody who they deem to be fake news or right-wing propagandists.
[03:38:24.870 --> 03:38:31.233]  And we see this, what they talk about, the language in this document is really coming to life, especially this summer.
[03:38:31.233 --> 03:38:38.037]  And we've seen it little bits here and there, people being kicked off Google, people being kicked off YouTube or having their channels deleted.
[03:38:38.037 --> 03:38:50.904]  But with the banning across the board of InfoWars, it showed the coordination between the social media companies and between the share blues, the media matters, and all these deep state organizations that are in the government.
[03:38:51.324 --> 03:38:51.424]  It's
[03:39:08.687 --> 03:39:14.993]  And we asked the question, how do they know this in 2016, early 2017, unless they have a plan for this?
[03:39:14.993 --> 03:39:18.777]  And obviously they haven't gone as far as to publish so much of that plan.
[03:39:18.777 --> 03:39:19.878]  And then there's another angle to this.
[03:39:19.878 --> 03:39:25.764]  You talk about the Chinese-style social credit score, the Chinese-style censorship.
[03:39:25.764 --> 03:39:30.069]  We're looking at it, and this is from Breitbart today, the President of China held a
[03:39:31.850 --> 03:39:40.292]  I'm at a conference, if you will, where they are talking about the importance of having a healthy internet, removing propaganda and politically sensitive content.
[03:39:40.292 --> 03:39:42.413]  And this all ties into that social credit score.
[03:39:42.413 --> 03:39:55.836]  And we're going to be seeing that much more of these style, Chinese style, communist and socialist style tactics across the social media spectrum implemented on right wing, on even middle, center of the aisle.
[03:39:55.836 --> 03:39:58.177]  If you look, there was a, on the Daily Caller today, Facebook.
[03:40:02.619 --> 03:40:04.342]  And this is the next phase that we're going to see.
[03:40:04.342 --> 03:40:12.278]  We're going to see the more middle-of-the-line, mainstream journalists at, you know, real news publications all across the country fighting these types of censorship attempts.
[03:40:13.237 --> 03:40:28.224]  Okay, and that's the thing too, it's a gradual, it's like a pincher movement almost, against all of the truth-telling media, while leaving the mainstream mockingbird media alone.
[03:40:28.224 --> 03:40:37.548]  So, you mentioned something earlier, which I just, I caught this, and I know you had done some investigation on this, that the fact that Crue, the ethics
[03:40:39.489 --> 03:40:50.634]  Yes, the Department of this Democracy Matters action plan had laid out that they were going to sue the president for ethics violations at every turn.
[03:40:50.634 --> 03:40:54.856]  And you said, how do they know that?
[03:40:54.856 --> 03:40:59.457]  Yeah, my question to you is, is Obama part of this?
[03:40:59.457 --> 03:41:04.380]  Because you looked into this like a lot, because Obama's got a team right now.
[03:41:04.380 --> 03:41:05.400]  Yeah, Obama's part of it.
[03:41:06.395 --> 03:41:13.798]  And this is where, you know, so much of the overlap in the FBI and the DOJ and, you know, we see the personnel changes in the FBI.
[03:41:13.798 --> 03:41:24.703]  What was it, 25 senior agents, you know, from Comey down have been removed from the FBI, which is a huge, you know, change historically looking at personnel.
[03:41:24.703 --> 03:41:30.906]  And this is all due to the corruption, all due to the conspiracy that they created with this phony Russian collusion story against President Trump.
[03:41:31.406 --> 03:41:31.566]  Yeah.
[03:41:48.733 --> 03:41:59.704]  Bogus investigation, this bogus Russian collusion narrative has produced nothing except the indictments and conviction of Paul Manafort on eight counts of financial crimes dealing back to 2005 and before.
[03:41:59.704 --> 03:42:05.590]  And the same thing with Michael Cohen, as you pointed out on our show last night, pleading guilty to two charges that don't even exist.
[03:42:05.590 --> 03:42:06.992]  And then you have the lawyer.
[03:42:07.739 --> 03:42:21.408]  Begging for money, I don't know if you saw this on CNN, asking people to donate to a Michael Cohen for Truth website, which was really funny because if you actually follow that link, the Michael Cohen for Truth website, it goes to a Donald Trump website.
[03:42:21.408 --> 03:42:23.950]  So somebody in the IT world screwed up there.
[03:42:23.950 --> 03:42:24.590]  But he was on CNN.
[03:42:25.851 --> 03:42:27.991]  Begging for money for Michael Cohen.
[03:42:27.991 --> 03:42:35.733]  And this is just the latest of the, you know, the sideline distractions, which they say in this document they're going to continue to use to delegitimize the president.
[03:42:35.733 --> 03:42:39.794]  All right, more with Hagman and Hagman straight ahead on the other side.
[03:42:39.794 --> 03:42:44.795]  Yeah, we've even got that video, if you guys want it, of people booing them when they ask for money for Cohen.
[03:42:44.795 --> 03:42:46.755]  Lenny Davis, the Hillary lawyer.
[03:42:46.755 --> 03:42:48.335]  This is all a Hillary Inside job.
[03:42:48.335 --> 03:42:49.556]  Stay with us with Hagman and Hagman.
[03:42:53.103 --> 03:42:54.444]  We knew it was coming.
[03:42:54.444 --> 03:42:55.905]  The whole thing was formulaic.
[03:42:55.905 --> 03:43:09.153]  First demonize InfoWars, lie about us, build a strawman, then sue us to add credibility to that, then have a few fake strikes on YouTube and Facebook with nebulous terms like bullying children and Islamophobia.
[03:43:09.153 --> 03:43:18.759]  And then voila, two weeks later, ban InfoWars completely off of dozens of major platforms where we were all in the top five or top ten
[03:43:19.119 --> 03:43:20.200]  News Feeds.
[03:43:20.200 --> 03:43:23.182]  Go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.

[03:43:51.324 --> 03:43:52.965]  This is what they don't want you to see.
[03:43:52.965 --> 03:44:00.510]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that

[03:44:12.939 --> 03:44:15.061]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.

[03:44:54.150 --> 03:44:56.490]  InfoWars Life is launching its newest product.

[03:47:15.407 --> 03:47:21.877]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:25.839 --> 03:47:27.720]  Doug Hagman, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[03:47:27.720 --> 03:47:30.701]  DougHagmanHagmanReport.com, 7 to 10 p.m.
[03:47:30.701 --> 03:47:31.342]  Eastern Time.
[03:47:31.342 --> 03:47:36.124]  It's such an honor to sit in for Infowars Alex Jones and be a part of this.
[03:47:36.124 --> 03:47:37.985]  And I'm going to tell you something, folks.
[03:47:37.985 --> 03:47:39.305]  We are under attack.
[03:47:39.305 --> 03:47:45.988]  The truth tellers, the people in the media, the new media, the truthful media, we are under attack.
[03:47:45.988 --> 03:47:47.369]  And there are no spectators.
[03:47:47.369 --> 03:47:51.191]  There cannot be any spectators in this war.
[03:47:51.191 --> 03:47:54.012]  If there's nothing else you take away from my time here,
[03:47:54.772 --> 03:47:56.193]  Is that you've got to make a decision.
[03:47:56.193 --> 03:47:59.914]  You are either for us, for the truth, or you're against us.
[03:47:59.914 --> 03:48:00.955]  There is no gray area.
[03:48:00.955 --> 03:48:04.036]  There's no, I'm gonna sit on the couch, wait to see how it plays out.
[03:48:04.036 --> 03:48:06.297]  I'm just gonna watch this.
[03:48:06.297 --> 03:48:07.118]  You can't do that.
[03:48:07.118 --> 03:48:12.360]  Another thing, I'm a big fan of the word schadenfreude.
[03:48:12.360 --> 03:48:16.742]  It's a German word and I've spoken about this before, perhaps on this platform, but I want to just make sure I
[03:48:17.622 --> 03:48:36.485]  I address this, because every time I see, for example, a news story about InfoWars, or about us for that matter, or about any other platform out there that's been banned or has been suffered in some way, there always are these people who pile on.
[03:48:36.485 --> 03:48:42.987]  Now, you remove the googly eyes, as I call them, and you know who I'm talking about, the googly eyes.
[03:48:42.987 --> 03:48:45.087]  Get rid of them, because they're just
[03:48:46.802 --> 03:48:48.884]  There's no help.
[03:48:48.884 --> 03:48:54.709]  But the people who pile on and say, well, good, good.
[03:48:54.709 --> 03:48:56.691]  You've got no idea what you're talking about.
[03:48:56.691 --> 03:48:58.993]  You've got no idea what you're doing.
[03:48:58.993 --> 03:49:05.159]  You have no idea how intellectually bankrupt you are in history.
[03:49:06.149 --> 03:49:14.074]  And I'm not talking about the audience that views and listens to this broadcast, the InfoWars.com, for information.
[03:49:14.074 --> 03:49:15.355]  I'm not talking about you.
[03:49:15.355 --> 03:49:27.123]  I'm talking about the people who listen for the very smallest of thing that they will take objection to, make objection to, and of course say, yay!
[03:49:27.123 --> 03:49:31.426]  You know, Alex Jones was banned, or InfoWars was banned, or Hagman was banned, or whatever.
[03:49:32.286 --> 03:49:34.827]  You people, look up the word schadenfreude.
[03:49:34.827 --> 03:49:43.491]  It's German for those who derive pleasure from someone else's misery, because I'm going to tell you, you're going to be living in that misery, whether you believe it or not.
[03:49:43.491 --> 03:49:51.394]  It's because of your acquiescence to this globalist agenda that you're going to find yourself in that position.
[03:49:51.394 --> 03:49:56.716]  So that's a warning to those people who pile on and say, okay, let's have a party now.
[03:49:57.577 --> 03:50:02.301]  Or, you know, the Hagman Report is crap, or InfoWars isn't.
[03:50:02.301 --> 03:50:03.603]  You get the idea, right?
[03:50:03.603 --> 03:50:05.805]  So, don't fall into that trap.
[03:50:05.805 --> 03:50:08.828]  Understand that we are all fighters in this war.
[03:50:08.828 --> 03:50:11.971]  There's no spectators, we're all participants.
[03:50:11.971 --> 03:50:14.934]  And if you choose, just keep your mouth shut and stay silent.
[03:50:15.715 --> 03:50:17.996]  And you're signing your own death warrant.
[03:50:17.996 --> 03:50:19.657]  Metaphorically speaking, of course.
[03:50:19.657 --> 03:50:22.079]  Which is why the midterms are so important.
[03:50:22.079 --> 03:50:23.199]  And what's this covering up?
[03:50:23.199 --> 03:50:26.141]  Look, I've got good information.
[03:50:26.141 --> 03:50:35.186]  I saw Jack Posobiec, a good friend of mine and a good friend of the program, a good friend of Infowars, saying that the Donald Trump Jr.
[03:50:35.186 --> 03:50:37.227]  indictment, Donald Trump Jr.'
[03:50:37.207 --> 03:50:39.208]  's in the crosshairs.
[03:50:39.208 --> 03:50:41.850]  And if you consider the nefarious nature of this,
[03:50:42.990 --> 03:50:45.192]  Of what Mueller is doing.
[03:50:45.192 --> 03:50:49.617]  Man, I'll tell you, it should send a chill up and down your spine.
[03:50:49.617 --> 03:50:53.661]  And I'm not talking about the chill from Acosta or whoever that was.
[03:50:53.661 --> 03:50:54.942]  I can't remember.
[03:50:54.942 --> 03:50:58.305]  I'm talking about what Mueller is doing.
[03:50:58.305 --> 03:51:03.070]  Because he is destroying not just a man, not just his family, but destroying a nation.
[03:51:03.670 --> 03:51:09.035]  Do we know if that indictment is from the Trump Tower meeting with Natalia?
[03:51:22.688 --> 03:51:30.595]  Because you wrote a story the other day that she was actually, you know, discharged or dispatched on orders under the Obama administration to conduct that meeting.
[03:51:30.595 --> 03:51:31.055]  Exactly.
[03:51:31.055 --> 03:51:35.619]  And there's some credible information that ties that directly to the Obama administration.
[03:51:35.619 --> 03:51:49.611]  So my question, if they bring this up in court, how will that, how would Mueller be able to dance around the fact that this was an Obama administration generated attempt to set him up to make it appear as though he is colluding with Russians?
[03:51:49.611 --> 03:51:49.891]  Lie.
[03:51:50.647 --> 03:51:53.189]  I mean, that's a great question.
[03:51:53.189 --> 03:51:57.833]  Here's a couple of issues I want to run by you because I'm not sure that you've heard these.
[03:51:57.833 --> 03:51:59.414]  Very interesting.
[03:51:59.414 --> 03:52:02.837]  We know, of course, Natalia Veselnitskaya.
[03:52:02.837 --> 03:52:09.143]  Now, we're talking about the indictment over the June 9, 2016 Donald Trump meeting at the Trump Tower.
[03:52:09.143 --> 03:52:10.904]  Okay, just so we're clear on that.
[03:52:10.904 --> 03:52:11.424]  It was 20 minutes.
[03:52:12.566 --> 03:52:19.154]  It was supposedly to obtain opposition research, Donald Trump saying, hey, you got something, all right, show me what it is.
[03:52:19.154 --> 03:52:20.776]  I mean, who wouldn't do that?
[03:52:20.776 --> 03:52:24.600]  20 minutes of nothing but the Magnitsky Act discussion.
[03:52:24.600 --> 03:52:27.123]  But here's something that most people don't know.
[03:52:27.123 --> 03:52:28.946]  Well, there's two things.
[03:52:28.946 --> 03:52:31.589]  One, perhaps most people do know, and the other, most people don't.
[03:52:32.770 --> 03:52:51.464]  The fact is, Glenn Simpson from Fusion GPS met with Veselnitskaya, the female attorney that talked about the Magnitsky Act with Donald Trump Jr., both the day before and the day after that Trump Tower meeting, whilst during his testimony, Simpson's testimony in front of Congress.
[03:52:51.464 --> 03:52:55.988]  He denied knowing about the meeting at all.
[03:52:55.988 --> 03:52:59.451]  But really, what's breaking now, and I had to go back to 2017, I think early 2017, to find this.
[03:53:02.994 --> 03:53:12.105]  Uh, Veselnitskaya was pictured with Obama officials in Washington, D.C., five days after that meeting.
[03:53:12.105 --> 03:53:14.107]  And how many people are...
[03:53:17.435 --> 03:53:17.635]  No.
[03:53:17.635 --> 03:53:18.536]  No, I did not.
[03:53:41.569 --> 03:53:47.290]  Looking at this whole situation, I don't know how they can continue with a straight face to further this Russian narrative.
[03:53:47.290 --> 03:53:51.671]  Everybody, including the American public, already knows that this is just a distraction.
[03:53:51.671 --> 03:53:55.932]  And what it is distracting from, in a big way, is the accomplishments of President Trump.
[03:53:55.932 --> 03:54:05.414]  If you saw today, the CEO of Target said that this is the best consumer and business environment that he's seen ever in his lifetime under President Trump.
[03:54:05.894 --> 03:54:10.778]  And I don't know if you guys talked about the Trump saying if he was impeached that the market would crash.
[03:54:10.778 --> 03:54:11.799]  I thought that was pretty interesting.
[03:54:11.799 --> 03:54:12.700]  But you mentioned it.
[03:54:12.700 --> 03:54:13.540]  I guarantee it.
[03:54:13.540 --> 03:54:13.961]  Yeah.
[03:54:13.961 --> 03:54:22.247]  And I want to make sure we get this in because on this, you know, we're talking about this document, the David Brock confidential memo on fighting basically Trump and the Trump agenda.
[03:54:22.247 --> 03:54:26.511]  On page 15 and 16, it outlines their overreaching or overarching strategy.
[03:54:26.511 --> 03:54:34.497]  And they specifically focus on the midterm elections, stating that their midterm map appears difficult for Democrats, damaging Trump in the next
[03:54:34.557 --> 03:54:34.697]  That's
[03:54:55.098 --> 03:55:10.587]  As soon as President Trump was elected, we're talking in the matter of days after he was elected, before he was even sworn in, they're putting this together and they're laying out this battle plan, identifying the midterm elections as the next chance where they can regain as much power.
[03:55:10.587 --> 03:55:19.912]  And if you read this document, one thing that's really interesting is that when they regain power, they do not plan to ever lose it again, or they plan on doing something which it will never change hands again.
[03:55:19.912 --> 03:55:24.154]  They're not going to find themselves in a situation where they have a quote-unquote enemy like President Trump.
[03:55:24.734 --> 03:55:45.812]  In the office that could be able to damage them and this is all part of their their strategy but it starts here really in the social media and media environments and now it's going to move to the mainstream more with the 2018 midterms and this is going to be really what we see rolled out here for the midterms is an indicator and just a small picture of what we're going to see in the next election in the presidential election in the 2020 race.
[03:55:48.385 --> 03:55:50.327]  Man, we only have a minute 40.
[03:55:50.327 --> 03:55:50.768]  Exactly.
[03:55:50.768 --> 03:55:53.351]  We got a minute 40 left, Joe.
[03:55:53.351 --> 03:55:59.718]  Yeah, so this is for all of the power for the rest of the days left on the planet.
[03:55:59.718 --> 03:56:00.559]  For the rest of America.
[03:56:01.232 --> 03:56:03.614]  Okay, and that's what they're playing for keeps.
[03:56:03.614 --> 03:56:07.897]  They're playing for all the marvels and they will do anything by any means necessary.
[03:56:07.897 --> 03:56:16.683]  By the way, Donald Trump, it's my belief, this is my personal belief, Donald Trump will be impeached or taken out completely in ways that we don't even want to contemplate.
[03:56:16.683 --> 03:56:17.783]  That's my viewpoint.
[03:56:17.783 --> 03:56:18.444]  I don't know.
[03:56:18.444 --> 03:56:20.085]  Your thoughts in 30 seconds on that?
[03:56:21.164 --> 03:56:21.945]  You know, I don't know.
[03:56:21.945 --> 03:56:40.247]  It's very interesting to see the amount of not only Democratic candidates, but also Republican candidates who are anti-Trumpers or never-Trumpers that are part of this establishment that are on board and behind the scenes, you know, clapping and cheering the censorship, clapping and cheering this socialist and communist takeover of the Democratic Party that it's hard to tell.
[03:56:40.287 --> 03:56:41.028]  I don't think so.
[03:57:07.451 --> 03:57:11.725]  You need a working political body to continue to move this agenda forward and Trump does not have that now.
[03:57:13.152 --> 03:57:13.792]  Fantastic.
[03:57:13.792 --> 03:57:15.053]  Joe Hagman, he's my son.
