[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:36.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.800]  it is Thursday the 14th day of April 2011 I'm Alex Jones your host we're gonna be
[00:42.800 --> 00:48.000]  here live as we are weekdays 11 to 2 p.m. Central live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:48.000 --> 00:52.600]  as well because there's so much news five days a week of coverage is not enough
[00:52.600 --> 00:56.300]  and of course we have 24 hour a day coverage of all the important global
[00:56.300 --> 01:02.640]  developments at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com incredible economic
[01:02.640 --> 01:08.540]  news obviously with the budget with the deficits with what's happening to
[01:08.540 --> 01:14.240]  commodities with Obama's official campaign launch speech that he gave last
[01:14.240 --> 01:22.140]  night calling for massive tax increases and gutting out of the tax code many of
[01:22.140 --> 01:28.740]  the most important write-offs that people have it is just absolutely terrible
[01:28.740 --> 01:34.640]  news and it's what we knew was coming and the Republicans are pushing flat taxes
[01:34.640 --> 01:40.440]  fair taxes you know national sales taxes VATs as a way to get rid of the income
[01:40.440 --> 01:44.340]  tax but the globalist for over a decade out of the IMF in the World Bank have
[01:44.340 --> 01:46.840]  always said they were going to move to this globally and they're still going to
[01:46.840 --> 01:50.700]  have an income tax it's just going to be called the social security tax so they'll
[01:50.700 --> 01:53.980]  cut the income taxes after they get this new system in first they're going to
[01:53.980 --> 01:58.900]  jack them up then make everybody angry then sell a lowering of the income tax a
[01:58.900 --> 02:02.400]  changing of the name the iris isn't going anywhere and then they'll lay a new
[02:02.400 --> 02:07.600]  VAT and sales tax on top of it and then jack up the income tax again that's
[02:07.600 --> 02:10.960]  always been the plan and that's the stated plan of the white papers not the
[02:10.960 --> 02:14.880]  stuff they tell the general public on the nightly news and we are in deep deep
[02:14.880 --> 02:22.840]  trouble also CNBC reporting gold will reach $1,600 an ounce in 2011 also
[02:22.840 --> 02:26.840]  Congress is saying Goldman Sachs lied to them the budget deal turns out to be a
[02:26.840 --> 02:31.360]  gigantic fraud as we told you two days ago now the press is reporting on the
[02:31.360 --> 02:36.320]  $38 billion in cuts were cuts that were already agreed upon last year and does
[02:36.320 --> 02:41.040]  nothing to deal with the thousand plus trillion dollars the private central
[02:41.040 --> 02:44.680]  banks have gotten our nation and the rest of the nations of the world that
[02:44.680 --> 02:49.880]  are under globalist control that's almost all of them to sign on to so that
[02:49.880 --> 02:56.960]  it's coming up also the TSA is running around saying that well well first they've
[02:56.960 --> 03:01.120]  been caught in a big lie saying that late last year that they would not grope
[03:01.120 --> 03:05.720]  children under eight and then they said children under 12 and then now they're
[03:05.720 --> 03:09.360]  still groping them and they're saying well we have to because al-Qaeda will
[03:09.360 --> 03:14.320]  use our social morals to attack us I mean this is all about switching off the
[03:14.320 --> 03:18.920]  thinking process even if you believe that al-Qaeda attacked us along with the
[03:18.920 --> 03:24.000]  Kibler elves on 9-11 and could carry out that attack then you would profile you
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.760]  would profile Muslims if you believe that fairy tale but a little blonde haired
[03:30.760 --> 03:36.680]  six-year-old girl with her doctor father and mother with a bunch of other
[03:36.680 --> 03:43.880]  children or old ladies on walkers and military personnel I mean this is a joke
[03:43.880 --> 03:48.400]  this is a joke it's about everybody being taught that you're all criminals you're
[03:48.400 --> 03:53.120]  all suspects you're guilty until we in fully enslave you not guilty until
[03:53.120 --> 03:58.360]  proven innocent guilty until we somehow suck off of you and reduce you down to
[03:58.360 --> 04:04.400]  absolute slaves also four years ago and then again last month the State
[04:04.400 --> 04:09.400]  Department issued a travel alert to Mexico as if we need them to tell us is
[04:09.400 --> 04:14.200]  deadly dangerous even in the resort areas that had previously been safer and
[04:14.200 --> 04:17.720]  they said yes Mexican drug cartels are targeting Americans well there was a
[04:17.720 --> 04:21.960]  backlash by Felipe Calderon through diplomatic circles so yesterday they
[04:21.960 --> 04:25.760]  rescinded that warning so that's like if you have a tornado coming down the
[04:25.760 --> 04:29.440]  highway towards you and the news tells you that there's not a tornado do you
[04:29.440 --> 04:32.360]  listen to the news and just go ahead and drive into the tornado I mean I don't
[04:32.360 --> 04:35.640]  need the State Department to tell me what's going on in Mexico we've known
[04:35.640 --> 04:39.400]  about the mass graves being found on a weekly basis for years the rocket
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.000]  attacks the mass murders all of it I mean I don't need the State Department
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.720]  to tell me about it but that's coming up as well see it's politically incorrect you
[04:47.720 --> 04:52.840]  criticize the failed narco terror state that is Mexico that's imploding into
[04:52.840 --> 04:58.160]  complete and absolute meddling I will be going over that as well stay with us
[04:59.360 --> 05:05.040]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[05:05.040 --> 05:09.520]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything

[08:44.220 --> 08:52.820]  the day of April 2011 and we have Mark Weisbrot joining us who's going to be
[08:52.820 --> 08:57.500]  breaking down in the middle of the next hour the big headlines we've seen at the
[08:57.500 --> 09:01.740]  drudge report and at the Associated Press Reuters everywhere about the brick
[09:01.740 --> 09:06.900]  group of nations China and others openly announcing they want an end of the
[09:06.900 --> 09:11.660]  dollar as the World Reserve currency and that they do not agree with the hegemonic
[09:11.660 --> 09:19.660]  new wars being expanded across the Middle East through the third-party shills
[09:19.660 --> 09:25.380]  that are the rebels centered in and around of course Libya he's going to be
[09:25.380 --> 09:29.740]  joining us he's the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research
[09:29.740 --> 09:35.740]  going over the big global announcements that the East especially wants to go
[09:35.740 --> 09:41.140]  away from the dollar meanwhile at the same time we have of course last weekend
[09:41.140 --> 09:47.900]  in New Hampshire the meeting many of the private banking heads and government
[09:47.900 --> 09:52.620]  officials in a quasi public private some of the meetings were private many of
[09:52.620 --> 09:57.140]  the meetings were public with George Soros for Bretton Woods to saying the
[09:57.140 --> 10:02.020]  dollar is already not the world reserve currency and is being totally phased
[10:02.020 --> 10:06.780]  out in a process this is a obviously huge economic development that we're
[10:06.780 --> 10:12.060]  watching unfold and it will cause unbelievable pain economically here in
[10:12.060 --> 10:16.420]  the United States that's pretty much the only major commodity the United States
[10:16.420 --> 10:22.460]  had left other than military weapons and propaganda is the dollar and this will
[10:22.460 --> 10:28.780]  cause commodity prices to go up gold silver oil transportation based on
[10:28.780 --> 10:34.980]  petro chemicals will go up all basic goods will go up people on fixed incomes
[10:34.980 --> 10:41.900]  will be decimated by this people that have savings will be absolutely raped
[10:41.900 --> 10:47.140]  by this situation and it's just calmly being reported and I was driving in
[10:47.140 --> 10:51.940]  listening to news radio this morning and some local talk show host on 590 a.m.
[10:51.940 --> 10:59.620]  were taking calls about the polls that are out depending on which poll you look
[10:59.620 --> 11:04.060]  at showing that 50 plus percent of Americans have been sold on the fraud
[11:04.060 --> 11:09.220]  that we can fix the deficit by raising taxes quote on the rich and that means
[11:09.220 --> 11:18.940]  individuals making 125,000 a year couples making more than 250,000 dollars a year
[11:18.940 --> 11:23.460]  that's not rich ladies and gentlemen that's lower middle class it'll get
[11:23.460 --> 11:27.860]  worse and worse as the dollar devaluation accelerates we may end up in
[11:27.860 --> 11:31.340]  four or five years having janitors being paid a hundred thousand dollars a
[11:31.340 --> 11:36.180]  year and it'll be the equivalent of 20,000 a day as this inflation begins to
[11:36.180 --> 11:39.180]  kick off and then and many economists are pointing this out the head of
[11:39.180 --> 11:42.300]  Walmart is saying of inflation by the end of the year is going to quote be
[11:42.300 --> 11:46.900]  serious but we see the federal government saying everything's fine but
[11:46.900 --> 11:50.680]  listening to people call in I heard quite a few of them say look we got the
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.700]  biggest and the best military in the world we got the money printing machines
[11:54.700 --> 12:00.340]  we can do whatever we want we'll see we don't run the military we don't run the
[12:00.340 --> 12:05.940]  private Federal Reserve we don't get the spoils we don't control the private
[12:05.940 --> 12:10.420]  printing presses the private Federal Reserve orders the Treasury to print the
[12:10.420 --> 12:14.020]  money and less than 2% of actual physical paper is out there for the
[12:14.020 --> 12:20.300]  digital money that the private Federal Reserve issues 97 plus percent and so
[12:20.300 --> 12:23.580]  there's this attitude by people especially who work for government or
[12:23.580 --> 12:26.780]  who are in the military because the host asked him are you in the military
[12:26.780 --> 12:33.100]  and he's like you bet I am I'm an officer and you can tell by his voice
[12:33.100 --> 12:37.580]  that he was an African-American so here's a guy that thinks he's running the
[12:37.580 --> 12:43.540]  show just like most yuppies he's in the military he's an officer and he thinks
[12:43.540 --> 12:54.780]  it's great to print money he thinks it's great to have the biggest military in
[12:54.780 --> 13:00.460]  the world and what's funny is I heard a very similar caller on the same I tell
[13:00.460 --> 13:03.900]  you I'm getting too busy these days I'm getting so busy I'm always forgetting to
[13:03.900 --> 13:09.020]  turn my turn my phone off I'm just gonna talk to him I'm on the air I got to go
[13:09.020 --> 13:16.300]  there's just too much news here in front of me as well I barely even got in here
[13:16.300 --> 13:19.940]  on time today I get ready at home
[13:23.140 --> 13:32.940]  there is there is there is such incredible naivete out there by people
[13:32.940 --> 13:37.660]  and they they feel like they're part of the system I mean here's a black guy
[13:37.660 --> 13:44.060]  calling into a radio show saying America's number one we got the biggest
[13:44.060 --> 13:48.700]  military and we control the printing presses and I heard a guy who sounded
[13:48.700 --> 13:52.820]  almost like the same person hours earlier on the same station saying
[13:52.820 --> 13:58.660]  basically the same thing and I hear that similar sentiment it's it's like this
[13:58.660 --> 14:04.700]  fake delusional exuberance that this is our military this is our government
[14:04.700 --> 14:10.500]  we're winners if we're part of it listen the they do control the printing
[14:10.500 --> 14:17.500]  presses the foreign offshore banks they are devaluing our currency it's a tax on
[14:17.500 --> 14:24.220]  your purchasing power your savings this military is run by foreign offshore
[14:24.220 --> 14:32.540]  corporations that control our federal government like a vending machine they
[14:32.540 --> 14:39.740]  put in pennies if you compare what they get back and million dollar bills come
[14:39.740 --> 14:45.060]  out the globalist will spend a couple hundred thousand on one politician a
[14:45.060 --> 14:50.880]  year in the house and that committee chairman will deliver them deals worth
[14:50.880 --> 14:59.060]  tens of billions in profit it's corporate welfare and all I hear is
[14:59.060 --> 15:04.100]  debates about cutting welfare cutting Social Security cutting entitlements and
[15:04.100 --> 15:10.140]  that that's going to fix the deficit I hear that from the Republicans and then
[15:10.140 --> 15:15.740]  from the Democrats I hear tax the rich that's going to fix it and both of those
[15:15.740 --> 15:22.700]  statements are frauds on their face you could cut all of the entitlements and as
[15:22.700 --> 15:29.940]  long as the government has still fraudulently signed us on to the one
[15:29.940 --> 15:35.540]  point five quadrillion dollars in derivatives that we've now signed on to
[15:35.540 --> 15:39.140]  our government has said yes we owe this even though it's not our debts
[15:39.140 --> 15:45.420]  predominantly then nothing else you do we'll fix it that's the big black hole
[15:45.420 --> 15:50.820]  that we're talking about here and they're discussing just tiny little issues
[15:50.820 --> 15:55.820]  that are on the table look it's it it's very very simple for folks that don't
[15:55.820 --> 15:59.980]  get it if you read the news every day if you track even mainline news in the
[15:59.980 --> 16:06.140]  last two years building up to the point we're now entering the the the period
[16:06.140 --> 16:10.380]  we're now entering you see constant statements by the head of the central
[16:10.380 --> 16:13.980]  bank of the EU the head of the central bank of England the head of the central
[16:13.980 --> 16:19.820]  bank of the United States the head of the Treasury all their minions and
[16:19.820 --> 16:26.900]  pundits and and and CNBC talking heads and Bloomberg talking heads and and
[16:26.900 --> 16:33.140]  Goldman Sachs head and then JP Morgan had all they come out and say is yes we
[16:33.140 --> 16:41.340]  need to raise taxes on the rich to pay down the deficit but the deficit and
[16:41.340 --> 16:49.260]  what they've signed us on to is a blank check to the private megabanks and so
[16:49.260 --> 16:55.780]  you see the private Federal Reserve at colleges at rotary clubs at influential
[16:55.780 --> 16:59.340]  groups all over the country constantly it was in the news a few years ago they
[16:59.340 --> 17:03.980]  recruited thousands of public speakers on top of their PR people to go out and
[17:03.980 --> 17:08.340]  talk to high schools colleges everybody and explain how great the Federal
[17:08.340 --> 17:14.900]  Reserve is and that we need tax increases in America to save America and pay
[17:14.900 --> 17:20.860]  off the deficit but then most the money that's paid in is in banker payoffs
[17:20.860 --> 17:27.740]  banker robberies that they call bailouts and goes offshore and for many years we
[17:27.740 --> 17:31.900]  can't even find where the money is going now because of private lawsuits some of
[17:31.900 --> 17:36.100]  its come out and it's hundreds and hundreds of billions to the European
[17:36.100 --> 17:39.140]  central bank and hundreds of billions of the British private central bank and
[17:39.140 --> 17:43.780]  hundreds of billions to the Chinese and billions and billions to Gaddafi and
[17:43.780 --> 17:53.620]  billions to MSNBC and GE and so most the money isn't going to some welfare mom
[17:53.620 --> 18:00.980]  who is you know got five welfare checks coming in for five kids and who drives
[18:00.980 --> 18:05.220]  around in a BMW and there's some truth to that stereotype some of that's going
[18:05.220 --> 18:12.260]  on but the issue is if you get rid of her welfare checks it is not even going
[18:12.260 --> 18:16.540]  to put a dent it is not even going to scratch the surface I say get rid of it
[18:16.540 --> 18:23.220]  great I mean I've seen the numbers that more than two-thirds of illegal aliens
[18:23.220 --> 18:26.860]  you bet the husband's out there working hard on the highway job or a restaurant
[18:26.860 --> 18:32.540]  or cutting people's yards and hard-working but mama is at home having
[18:32.540 --> 18:37.580]  kids and every one of them is going on welfare and daddy's paid off the books
[18:37.580 --> 18:42.780]  in cash and sure he pays sales taxes and he pays taxes when he gets a cell
[18:42.780 --> 18:46.340]  phone but he didn't pay an income taxes to the private fellow reserve but the
[18:46.340 --> 18:51.660]  globalist then leave them alone because they want to merge the countries they
[18:51.660 --> 18:57.580]  want to drive down the wages they want to bring in political groups that won't
[18:57.580 --> 19:01.420]  get in the melting pot who won't assimilate who can be played as a
[19:01.420 --> 19:08.380]  political tool because they're on welfare so sure I'm all for kicking the
[19:08.380 --> 19:13.020]  welfare queens off their welfare by the way I've now discovered in Texas and

[19:19.220 --> 19:25.140]  government workers who go out then and feed on everybody else and all the
[19:25.140 --> 19:29.540]  bureaucrats from people who were on welfare they take them and then go we
[19:29.540 --> 19:32.580]  got more government programs we're gonna send you to community college you're

[24:18.140 --> 24:23.260]  give it back to you like they're your mommy he wants to cut back on the tax
[24:23.260 --> 24:27.100]  credit you get for your mortgage deduction he wants to raise taxes on
[24:27.100 --> 24:32.100]  people making over $125,000 a year individually or a quarter million
[24:32.100 --> 24:38.620]  $250,000 in couples and I kept hearing yesterday evening and today all over
[24:38.620 --> 24:43.900]  talk radio all over CNN all over Fox just scanning through the XM dial
[24:43.900 --> 24:49.740]  listening to radio and TV programs that are on XM and reading online that wow
[24:49.740 --> 24:56.700]  57% of Americans agree that we should up taxes on the rich so this morning I
[24:56.700 --> 25:04.420]  actually got the poll they were quoting the APGFK poll are your taxes fair most
[25:04.420 --> 25:13.620]  say yes and then when I went over it it said 54% believe their tax bills are
[25:13.620 --> 25:17.940]  either somewhat fair or very fair compared with 46% who say they are
[25:17.940 --> 25:23.460]  unfair so I can't find this 57 number I keep seeing all over the news this is
[25:23.460 --> 25:29.060]  54 but then it goes on should taxes be raised to eat into the huge federal
[25:29.060 --> 25:35.100]  deficits among the public 62% say they favor cutting government services to
[25:35.100 --> 25:39.700]  stop up the red ink just 29% say raised taxes but listening to the news they
[25:39.700 --> 25:45.980]  keep saying 57% I know you've heard it support cutting the deficit by raising
[25:45.980 --> 25:52.940]  taxes but this says only 29% then you read deeper into the poll and it says
[25:52.940 --> 26:02.660]  those above 60 those above 65 that they are the ones that want to raise taxes
[26:02.660 --> 26:08.460]  and that shows their complete ignorance look here's the issue for
[26:08.460 --> 26:14.700]  anybody you're arguing with about this if the private Federal Reserve is out
[26:14.700 --> 26:19.340]  there lobbying that the way to fix our economy is to raise taxes and we've got
[26:19.340 --> 26:23.700]  former Fed chief Alan Greenspan who helped get rid of Glass-Steagall and get
[26:23.700 --> 26:27.660]  us into all this trouble and all these big banking heads of Goldman Sachs and
[26:27.660 --> 26:31.700]  the rest of them keep telling us the answer is to raise your taxes that
[26:31.700 --> 26:34.940]  will fix America there's no discussion about auditing the Fed no
[26:34.940 --> 26:38.900]  discussion about saying no we're not signing on to these trillions and
[26:38.900 --> 26:42.380]  trillions of dollars of derivatives debts that the globalists have gotten
[26:42.380 --> 26:49.940]  Greece and Portugal and Ireland and the US and England to sign on to Iceland
[26:49.940 --> 26:54.380]  just said no after a year-long battle so the government's going to quote Sue
[26:54.380 --> 26:59.340]  Iceland the British government is but it's come out in Iceland's news that
[26:59.340 --> 27:04.380]  almost all the debt what was it last time I looked and over 90% is owed by the
[27:04.380 --> 27:09.700]  private central bank that itself is a consortium of other private banks the
[27:09.700 --> 27:13.860]  the people the 300 something thousand that live in Iceland mainly in the
[27:13.860 --> 27:18.220]  capital of Reykjavík they don't owe it just like they admitted a few months ago
[27:18.220 --> 27:21.500]  in Ireland their own central bank had said well this really isn't our debt
[27:21.500 --> 27:26.540]  but it's good to have foreign banks run Ireland that was a quote in the BBC just
[27:26.540 --> 27:30.540]  bizarre in-your-face statements like radiation is good for you the people of
[27:30.540 --> 27:35.940]  Fukushima ought to be thankful and culture says just bizarre in your face
[27:35.940 --> 27:39.900]  things that don't even make sense to break your will to condition you to
[27:39.900 --> 27:44.980]  accept their crazy activities they know what they're doing it's like Carl
[27:44.980 --> 27:49.260]  Rove saying we control reality doesn't matter what we say is true we say it's
[27:49.260 --> 27:53.580]  true so it is they're just acclimating us to accept that and here's another
[27:53.580 --> 27:58.220]  headline on from the Hill poll majority okay with tax bill and you know why
[27:58.220 --> 28:05.780]  around 51% and growing of the American people pay no federal income tax
[28:05.780 --> 28:12.340]  now now you hear this lie though that 51% of Americans don't pay any taxes
[28:12.340 --> 28:16.460]  that's a fraud you pay taxes that are added on to your cell bill you pay it on
[28:16.460 --> 28:22.220]  your water your trash pickup on the food you buy sales taxes you pay taxes on
[28:22.220 --> 28:27.620]  all of the expenses that are added on by companies and services you pay taxes in
[28:27.620 --> 28:33.340]  your dollar being devalued and your purchasing power you pay taxes on
[28:33.340 --> 28:37.020]  property tax even if you live in an apartment that property taxes added on
[28:37.020 --> 28:44.060]  to your bill you pay hundreds of taxes you have the sin taxes that target the
[28:44.060 --> 28:52.820]  poor cigarettes alcohol gas taxes the poorest Americans pay those growing gas
[28:52.820 --> 28:58.380]  taxes all of this is going on all of this is happening and so you hear this
[28:58.380 --> 29:04.220]  see it's this was frustrating there's such a tissue of lies that how do you
[29:04.220 --> 29:08.220]  even educate people and how they're being lied to when there's so many layers
[29:08.220 --> 29:15.140]  of lies it's true that 51% don't pay any income tax to the private Federal
[29:15.140 --> 29:19.540]  Reserve that we had to have till 1913 the people think the country runs off of
[29:19.540 --> 29:23.620]  and it goes to nothing but interest on the debt not congressional debt not
[29:23.620 --> 29:27.540]  government debt debt that's created when a dollar is created a dollar of debts
[29:27.540 --> 29:31.940]  created just to have money debts created that's why it's impossible to ever pay
[29:31.940 --> 29:37.100]  back and they lie about exactly how big the debts are I'm gonna get into all
[29:37.100 --> 29:42.260]  that because there's headlines about three plus trillion the banks oh and
[29:42.260 --> 29:49.460]  they're dead it's 1.5 quadrillion conservatively and it makes my head
[29:49.460 --> 29:56.700]  hurt we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[30:11.700 --> 30:15.740]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[30:15.740 --> 30:19.620]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.620 --> 30:23.740]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.740 --> 30:28.100]  overloaded and now a new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:28.100 --> 30:32.380]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.380 --> 30:36.100]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[30:36.100 --> 30:40.300]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[33:11.540 --> 33:23.060]  we are back live my friends thank you for joining us look the problem is to
[33:23.060 --> 33:29.780]  boil it down is that we're being told what cut government raise taxes that
[33:29.780 --> 33:33.300]  that is going to be the way that we're gonna fix the economy ladies and
[33:33.300 --> 33:36.100]  gentlemen I was looking at some of the numbers last night even in the Wall
[33:36.100 --> 33:43.900]  Street Journal that in 1999 the US government had half the budget size
[33:43.900 --> 33:52.660]  that it has now and who can say that our country was not better off then
[33:52.660 --> 33:58.780]  financially the taxes were lower there were more jobs naftan Gad hadn't had a
[33:58.780 --> 34:04.460]  chance yet to deindustrialize our country and so now that the budget is
[34:04.460 --> 34:15.860]  double what it was just 11 12 years ago and the solution is a 38 billion dollar
[34:15.860 --> 34:26.100]  cut in the budget that was just leaving or crumbs sitting on the table that
[34:26.100 --> 34:31.780]  hadn't been spent in last year's budget that's the Republican and Democrats idea
[34:31.780 --> 34:36.380]  of cutting the budget and they're saying let's kick welfare moms off their
[34:36.380 --> 34:45.140]  welfare when even the Washington Post last year reported 640 plus trillion
[34:45.140 --> 34:51.140]  dollars in global derivatives with the United States signed on to quote bail
[34:51.140 --> 34:55.980]  out the banks for more than 60% of it so let's just say it's the lower number of
[34:55.980 --> 35:00.340]  600 plus trillion that the Washington Post reported on and not what other
[35:00.340 --> 35:05.260]  economists have argued about here on air that it's over 1,000 trillion some over
[35:05.260 --> 35:12.580]  1.5 quadrillion so that's the issue and they're maneuvering us now in to all of
[35:12.580 --> 35:20.060]  these huge tax increases and you've got the mega rich out there lobbying for
[35:20.060 --> 35:27.900]  higher taxes through their different George Soros media organizations they
[35:27.900 --> 35:33.700]  are out there pushing everyone pushing the working class to believe it the
[35:33.700 --> 35:37.780]  middle class is the elite that is basically engineered the crisis we're
[35:37.780 --> 35:43.540]  in so that the ultra rich can scapegoat them and then raise taxes on the middle
[35:43.540 --> 35:47.540]  class and you do the math it's very simple it will do nothing to reduce
[35:47.540 --> 35:53.220]  these deficits it will only put the economy into more of a freefall stall so
[35:53.220 --> 35:57.500]  it's a very simple equation the big mega banks are all over the news on record
[35:57.500 --> 36:01.420]  for years saying raised taxes raised taxes raised taxes raised taxes on the
[36:01.420 --> 36:07.620]  rich and they say that somebody making $125,000 a year individually or 250,000
[36:07.620 --> 36:15.500]  in a couple and why is that because general electric and Google and the rest
[36:15.500 --> 36:22.300]  of the fortune 100 pay almost no taxes then they say well our employees and
[36:22.300 --> 36:26.980]  our CEOs and our executives pay taxes if they're part of the US division most
[36:26.980 --> 36:30.900]  of them are part of these international divisions and are based in countries
[36:30.900 --> 36:36.620]  with almost no corporate tax no income tax you know if you do the math and look
[36:36.620 --> 36:40.980]  at it China has much lower taxes in the US of course because they are
[36:40.980 --> 36:46.820]  incentivizing the factories and the jobs and the brains to travel there to move
[36:46.820 --> 36:51.140]  there I mean I know so many Americans that have multiple degrees who've left
[36:51.140 --> 36:56.460]  America to go live in China to go live in India to go live in Mexico at the
[36:56.460 --> 37:00.620]  factories because the jobs aren't here and the very same multinational
[37:00.620 --> 37:04.500]  corporations that have moved overseas were the ones that lobbied for the
[37:04.500 --> 37:09.660]  regulations to be jacked up here and to be lowered in other countries they're
[37:09.660 --> 37:14.580]  the ones that got the tax incentives to move overseas they're the ones that push
[37:14.580 --> 37:19.660]  to get the animal ID and the premises ID to shut down the small farms and
[37:19.660 --> 37:24.860]  ranches and then they get waivers for their big agribusiness it's very simple
[37:24.860 --> 37:30.020]  are we hearing about getting rid of the repeal of Glass-Steagall and bringing
[37:30.020 --> 37:33.220]  Glass-Steagall back to stop the derivatives they're creating more of
[37:33.220 --> 37:38.580]  them now counterfeit money that we've now been forced to sign on to are we
[37:38.580 --> 37:42.260]  hearing anything about dollar devaluation attacks on everyone are we
[37:42.260 --> 37:46.220]  hearing anything about the private federal reserve are we hearing anything
[37:46.220 --> 37:52.260]  about the trillions of dollars secretly pumped out overseas and to domestic
[37:52.260 --> 37:57.940]  corporations here in the u.s. your tax money going to hundreds of newspapers
[37:57.940 --> 38:06.260]  scores of TV stations multiple TV networks think tanks propaganda groups
[38:06.380 --> 38:12.980]  it's incredible it is a completely unlevel playing field designed for the
[38:12.980 --> 38:18.300]  globalist to consolidate all of the markets all of the industries the
[38:18.300 --> 38:23.340]  entire economy and I know I keep hammering on this and hammering on it
[38:23.340 --> 38:27.300]  because I listen to talk radio I listen to liberals conservatives all of them
[38:27.300 --> 38:32.740]  and none of them get any of it and even mainline libertarians are like good
[38:32.740 --> 38:37.940]  kick all the welfare queens off their welfare good you know get rid of social
[38:37.940 --> 38:42.220]  security it's a fraud to begin with and yeah it is a fraud but it's all people
[38:42.220 --> 38:47.660]  got and if you got rid of it it wouldn't fix the problem only getting rid of the
[38:47.660 --> 38:53.340]  fellow reserve only slashing taxes across the board only getting rid of the
[38:53.340 --> 38:57.060]  income tax which was created the same year as the fellow reserve and is in the
[38:57.060 --> 39:02.500]  communist manifesto written by the bankers and sold as the people's
[39:02.500 --> 39:06.980]  rebellion just like today George Soros funded groups on record go take over
[39:06.980 --> 39:10.780]  Bank of America and they don't go in there and say arrest the bankers get rid
[39:10.780 --> 39:15.860]  of the fellow reserve they say raise taxes on the rich but then the rich are
[39:15.860 --> 39:21.180]  a person making $125,000 a year that's who they're talking about not raise
[39:21.180 --> 39:25.140]  taxes on George Soros who's back in the news saying raise taxes and we could
[39:25.140 --> 39:29.900]  absorb more debt because he sits above those rules he's part of the corporate
[39:29.900 --> 39:35.260]  power structure that's exempt from almost all of the taxes he's part of the
[39:35.260 --> 39:40.900]  corporate power structure that's allowed to create fake derivatives they take the
[39:40.900 --> 39:47.060]  trillions and make her bailout money that they get interest free then they go
[39:47.060 --> 39:55.540]  out and loan it for 5% 10% 15 20 30 40 50 60 now some of the yearly interest
[39:55.540 --> 40:02.500]  rates are 79.9% but they don't just stop there loaning out to the general
[40:02.500 --> 40:05.380]  public's a small part of their business that's why many big banks are saying
[40:05.380 --> 40:08.340]  we're just closing having public accounts we don't even want your money
[40:08.340 --> 40:13.020]  you're like you don't want my money okay we'll take it but we'll give you a half
[40:13.020 --> 40:16.020]  a percentage point because we don't even care we don't need it you know why
[40:16.020 --> 40:18.740]  they don't need it because they can take those trillions and bank her bailout
[40:18.740 --> 40:24.860]  money and they can for every dollar they get loan out 10 and that's under the
[40:24.860 --> 40:32.580]  previous pre 1999 pre Glass-Steagall repeal after that they can take a dollar
[40:32.580 --> 40:39.740]  and they can leverage it out thousands of times according to the economists
[40:39.740 --> 40:43.020]  we've interviewed and talked to and I mean people like professor black the
[40:43.020 --> 40:46.740]  former top federal regulator he said there's thousands of times they can
[40:46.740 --> 40:54.900]  leverage it thousands of times one dollar thousands of dollars so when you
[40:54.900 --> 41:00.180]  see headlines about 3.3 trillion that the banks are in debt with and they need
[41:00.180 --> 41:04.980]  more money ladies and gentlemen the banks created those derivatives to take
[41:04.980 --> 41:08.500]  over society when those derivatives weren't known to be fraudulent they
[41:08.500 --> 41:13.260]  were able to buy up much of the society much of the infrastructure with it and
[41:13.260 --> 41:18.780]  now they hold the whole infrastructure hostage because they have infected every
[41:18.780 --> 41:24.420]  financial instrument every financial system with the derivatives that are
[41:24.420 --> 41:29.300]  hundreds of times bigger than all the real assets in the world and so they
[41:29.300 --> 41:35.460]  have successfully siamese twinned all of their fraud into the pension funds into
[41:35.460 --> 41:41.180]  social security into the police pensions the firemen pensions they've done it
[41:41.180 --> 41:46.780]  they've got us right where they want us totally dependent on them it's like
[41:46.780 --> 41:51.380]  having a giant tumor that is half your heart and if they remove the tumor you
[41:51.380 --> 41:56.340]  don't have a heart anymore and you die that's what they've done and everything
[41:56.340 --> 41:59.980]  they do is about dependence everything they do is about you having to get
[41:59.980 --> 42:04.820]  permission from them to do anything you gotta get a license to have a garden in
[42:04.820 --> 42:08.580]  your backyard you gotta not even get permission you're not allowed to make
[42:08.580 --> 42:13.260]  your school children's lunches and send them into the public school your children
[42:13.260 --> 42:17.380]  aren't allowed to play dodgeball again just everything is prisoner training and
[42:17.380 --> 42:23.340]  I know I've been ranting about this it's just I'm gonna get more into it later
[42:23.340 --> 42:28.980]  after our guests leave us and I want to get into Obama's speech as well there's
[42:28.980 --> 42:34.380]  some of the other financial news that I was mentioning and I said it incorrectly
[42:34.380 --> 42:42.620]  banks face 3.6 trillion not 3.3 trillion wall of debt IMF says and the IMF is
[42:42.620 --> 42:47.300]  posing as our savior the consortium internationally four groups like the
[42:47.300 --> 42:52.620]  fellow reserve the receivership arm and they're now posing as the experts
[42:52.620 --> 42:56.260]  telling us about the problems they created and saying the banks need
[42:56.260 --> 43:03.900]  trillions of dollars or there could be a collapse and a default globally tied
[43:03.900 --> 43:11.700]  into governmental currencies and private stocks if we don't prop them up well
[43:11.700 --> 43:16.180]  what did they ask for just three four months ago at Davos they said we want
[43:16.180 --> 43:23.460]  100 trillion dollars we want to issue and we want your governments to sign
[43:23.460 --> 43:29.380]  on to to give it value promising your tax money as as the as the backer of it
[43:29.380 --> 43:34.980]  this isn't backed by gold this is backed by us the taxpayers that's the collateral
[43:34.980 --> 43:39.940]  it's you it's me it's all of us they want 100 trillion what will they do with
[43:39.940 --> 43:48.660]  100 trillion dollars well they'll leverage it and nobody got rid of the
[43:48.660 --> 43:51.580]  repeal of Glass-Steagall nobody brought Glass-Steagall back and they got rid of
[43:51.580 --> 43:55.260]  similar laws in every country what are they gonna do with that they're gonna
[43:55.260 --> 44:03.260]  leverage it to the infinity but what is ten times 100 trillion it's one
[44:03.260 --> 44:10.100]  quadrillion under the old fractional reserve banking system they want one
[44:10.100 --> 44:16.340]  quadrillion backed up by you the taxpayer and they're telling us about a
[44:16.340 --> 44:21.980]  limousine liberal they're telling us about a welfare queen they're telling us
[44:21.980 --> 44:25.660]  oh notice though in all the republican attacks and he and even
[44:25.660 --> 44:28.540]  democrats calling for cutting welfare nobody's talking about taking the
[44:28.540 --> 44:35.180]  precious illegal aliens welfare more than two-thirds on it see that's how the
[44:35.180 --> 44:37.980]  illegal aliens can work for less because they're getting the supplement of
[44:37.980 --> 44:41.900]  the welfare and they get paid under the table just like all these good old boys
[44:41.900 --> 44:44.620]  that don't understand economics and they say I'm glad we've got the biggest
[44:44.620 --> 44:49.420]  present population four million in the world I'm glad that tens of millions of
[44:49.420 --> 44:53.620]  Americans have criminal records because we're law and order oh really you're
[44:53.620 --> 44:58.060]  glad that there's a 98% federal conviction rate they're convicting
[44:58.060 --> 45:03.100]  innocent people oh you're glad that there are hundreds and hundreds of private
[45:03.100 --> 45:11.940]  prisons doing call centers furniture license plates electronics on average
[45:11.940 --> 45:17.220]  for 25 cents an hour they'll have the factory right next door like they do in
[45:17.220 --> 45:21.420]  China and they'll bus over the prisoners every day to work eight hours in a
[45:21.420 --> 45:26.580]  factory getting 25 cents an hour oh you still don't get what I'm saying if you're
[45:26.580 --> 45:30.500]  a new listener you're competing against the illegal aliens that will work for
[45:30.500 --> 45:36.780]  half and the illegal aliens are competing against people that work for 25
[45:36.780 --> 45:45.900]  cents an hour what is that over eight hours can you do the math what's what's
[45:45.900 --> 45:54.700]  eight times 25 cents can you do the math we're working for $2 a day and you're
[45:54.700 --> 46:04.300]  like good you don't know what you're doing idiot you're a moron and you're
[46:04.300 --> 46:08.060]  like what about I hear about violent criminals being released while they let
[46:08.060 --> 46:12.060]  a murderer go after three years because they've got actuaries this is a
[46:12.060 --> 46:16.620]  business they release the violent offenders to menace the public and they
[46:16.620 --> 46:21.380]  keep the peaceful pothead in there for five years because the peaceful pothead
[46:21.380 --> 46:29.740]  is gonna be about her worker you know today I almost didn't do the show because
[46:29.740 --> 46:33.260]  I don't like to blow up and yell and scream because it exhaust me and it
[46:33.260 --> 46:36.340]  gives me a headache you know I yell and scream and blow up folks that's real I
[46:36.340 --> 46:41.420]  mean I personally feel like throwing my coffee cup through the window I feel
[46:41.420 --> 46:44.900]  like tumping this whole desk over and I feel like just trying to run away
[46:44.900 --> 46:49.780]  somewhere because I got to sit here and study this and look at it and know what
[46:49.780 --> 46:53.980]  the bankers are doing and know their whole program and understand how evil it
[46:53.980 --> 46:57.660]  is and understand how wicked they are and know how it's all premeditated in
[46:57.660 --> 47:02.380]  their own admissions and then I've got to hear how still stupid the public is
[47:02.380 --> 47:06.100]  when I read the editorials and I listen to callers to talk radio and other
[47:06.100 --> 47:15.020]  people shows they don't have a hope of a prayer if they don't get religion and
[47:15.020 --> 47:21.740]  wake up to the New World Order I mean we are far beyond anything I ever imagined
[47:21.740 --> 47:27.740]  and and and this is just the beginning I almost turned around today and told
[47:27.740 --> 47:32.220]  them to rebroadcast and I rarely get this type of nasty mood but I mean I am
[47:32.220 --> 47:40.940]  just I just I'm so sick of watching people being conned I'm so sick of
[47:40.940 --> 47:46.420]  watching people having no inkling of how the global system works no geopolitical
[47:46.420 --> 47:49.860]  understanding they don't even know who the three branches of government are
[47:49.860 --> 47:53.180]  they don't even know what the Bill of Rights and Constitution is they've been
[47:53.180 --> 47:56.820]  deliberately dumbed down by television and the culture and the public schools
[47:56.820 --> 48:01.100]  and we're multi generations into the dumbing down now where we are in so
[48:01.100 --> 48:04.780]  much trouble and then those of us that are awake are listed in homeland
[48:04.780 --> 48:09.380]  security training memos and documents that are constantly being leaked where
[48:09.380 --> 48:14.660]  the government is preparing to release the military and the police against us
[48:15.980 --> 48:23.340]  we're a nation of spoiled brat children mentally that mean a lot of Americans
[48:23.340 --> 48:35.580]  don't work hard and I mean it's just like the reactors blowing up a month ago
[48:35.580 --> 48:40.380]  in giant mushroom clouds and fuel rods spraying and I went and pulled up online
[48:40.380 --> 48:44.620]  to make sure I was right what a fuel rod looks like that particular design and
[48:44.620 --> 48:48.100]  then I blew up the video here at the office of the explosions and I could
[48:48.100 --> 48:53.340]  see the fuel rods in the air and I said four weeks ago plus when the when the
[48:53.340 --> 48:58.340]  reactor three blew up I said those are fuel rods and then nuclear workers called
[48:58.340 --> 49:02.100]  in and said yes they are and then three weeks later the New York Times said yes
[49:02.100 --> 49:07.980]  the Japanese government now admits fuel rods were blown up to a mile away and I
[49:07.980 --> 49:11.780]  had to get the emails and the calls and I'm a fear monger and I'm saying fuel
[49:11.780 --> 49:15.420]  rods were blown everywhere I went and looked up the design I went and looked
[49:15.420 --> 49:19.020]  up the fact that they were storing them on top of the facility and I could see
[49:19.020 --> 49:26.820]  the stink and things blowing up into the air 4,000 feet and the radiation
[49:26.820 --> 49:30.580]  settling in across the United States the ready they're now reporting today in
[49:30.580 --> 49:34.420]  mainstream jet Japanese TV stations that yes much of Japan is now I'm going to
[49:34.420 --> 49:38.860]  be uninhabitable told you that a month ago and it's not because I'm smart folks
[49:38.860 --> 49:43.060]  that's what's so frustrating about this I mean normal people if they saw giant
[49:43.060 --> 49:47.420]  reactors blowing up and we're downwind in the US and I have children a normal
[49:47.420 --> 49:51.660]  American a normal human would go with the internet all the knowledge of the
[49:51.660 --> 49:57.500]  world in front of us and look up a general electric Mark one mocks reactor
[49:57.500 --> 50:01.820]  and I went and looked up the other general electric reactor and I went and
[50:01.820 --> 50:05.780]  looked up the other Japanese reactors and I went and looked at their design and
[50:05.780 --> 50:08.740]  I went and looked at articles and I went and looked at locals two years ago
[50:08.740 --> 50:14.060]  protesting they're storing a 644,000 fuel rods there and I went and looked up
[50:14.060 --> 50:17.660]  with that particular fuel rod package looked like and I blew the video up in
[50:17.660 --> 50:22.860]  there the stinking fuel rods I'm not smart folks I got a family downwind from
[50:22.860 --> 50:28.660]  this and I spent days researching it so I can tell you what was happening I know
[50:28.660 --> 50:32.780]  about the Federal Reserve okay I know about what sodium fluoride does to you
[50:32.780 --> 50:37.260]  I know they're putting uranium in our water here to sterilize us I know the
[50:37.260 --> 50:41.580]  government runs giant child kidnapping rings okay it's all documented I know
[50:41.580 --> 50:46.340]  we're in trouble I know how bad it is and I'm sick of people living in denial
[50:46.340 --> 50:50.740]  out there even you so-called people that claim your Patriots or whatever you're
[50:50.740 --> 50:53.940]  either Cohen tell pro some of you out there or you're just jealous but
[50:53.940 --> 50:56.820]  somebody actually works and has the truth meanwhile I'm just trying to

[51:11.780 --> 51:15.900]  United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming homeless all
[51:15.900 --> 51:20.100]  caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media continues to ignore

[54:44.300 --> 54:47.900]  study nuclear reactors I'm not gonna go look at the design of what's blown up I
[54:47.900 --> 54:52.460]  don't care if I'm down when I can't see it this guy's a weirdo that he would
[54:52.460 --> 54:58.340]  spend day after day in the aggregate studying exactly what happened getting
[54:58.340 --> 55:03.900]  the experts on to confer with them I'm a weirdo because I've studied GMO cross
[55:03.900 --> 55:10.940]  species crops that are designed to cause cancer and infertility on record red
[55:10.940 --> 55:14.340]  handed how many scientists have I interviewed where at these big companies
[55:14.340 --> 55:18.460]  and go this is sterilizing all the mice they're like a little added benefit don't
[55:18.460 --> 55:23.980]  worry about that part of the genome change they're like but this is gonna
[55:23.980 --> 55:30.860]  sterilize people there are too many people I mean we've had these folks
[55:30.860 --> 55:34.860]  from these research laboratories on who have witnessed it the UN has been caught
[55:34.860 --> 55:39.020]  did you hear me earlier to say that radioactive isotopes are added to almost
[55:39.020 --> 55:45.340]  every municipal water supply what 71% of the US cities and counties water
[55:45.340 --> 55:51.020]  districts I mean yeah that's a wild insane sounding statement totally true
[55:51.020 --> 55:54.220]  what are we gonna do about it the answer is most of you absolutely nothing
[55:54.220 --> 55:57.980]  you're gonna sit there and say look at the bad man look at the crazy man you're
[55:57.980 --> 56:04.460]  not gonna go look and see if those fuel rods got thrown a mile away admitted
[56:04.460 --> 56:09.500]  three and a half weeks after I told you you're not gonna go look and see if
[56:09.500 --> 56:13.460]  they're putting radioactive isotopes in your water because it couldn't be true
[56:13.460 --> 56:18.180]  because if it if it was true well then something needs to be done about it we
[56:18.180 --> 56:21.940]  better find out why they're doing this huh we better find out why have you go
[56:21.940 --> 56:25.060]  to the city council and bring this up even with news articles about it they
[56:25.060 --> 56:30.220]  laugh at you see that's the answer for everything in America now is just laugh
[56:30.220 --> 56:36.220]  at it it's just funny why do you care so much Alex you know I get the statement
[56:36.220 --> 56:44.300]  all the time you must be paranoid so if I walk outside because my dogs barking at
[56:44.300 --> 56:49.980]  2 a.m. and my neighbor's house is on fire this actually happened when I was
[56:49.980 --> 56:53.740]  about 10 years old parents wake me up we go outside neighbor's house on fire
[56:53.740 --> 56:56.940]  flame shooting out and and and we call the fire department would that be
[56:56.940 --> 57:02.940]  paranoid if I see giant reactors blowing sky high with mushroom clouds
[57:02.940 --> 57:06.900]  floating towards our west coast and I I go do research and analyze what's
[57:06.900 --> 57:11.060]  happening accurately for you I'm the bad man
[57:15.380 --> 57:22.180]  and I'm the bad man because we told you eight years ago with the TSA was gonna
[57:22.180 --> 57:27.060]  metastasize into because I saw a Homeland Security Edridge say what they would do
[57:27.060 --> 57:31.020]  and so I guess I deserved to have the ADL demonizing me in the Southern
[57:31.020 --> 57:38.620]  Property Law Center in the federal government and George Soros I guess in
[57:38.620 --> 57:45.380]  the land of insane people the sane are insane I'd be like going back to 1941
[57:45.380 --> 57:48.740]  Germany and trying to tell Germans that rounding people up and putting them in
[57:48.740 --> 57:53.460]  camps was wrong they'd arrest me in a second because I'd be crazy and that's
[57:53.460 --> 57:58.700]  all it is today like I'm crazy because I don't like 51 million abortions in the
[57:58.700 --> 58:10.460]  last 37 30 39 years I don't know 1973 to the math 39 years 38 years I just don't
[58:10.460 --> 58:17.900]  even know anymore I got all this TSA news coming up they put a statement out
[58:17.900 --> 58:28.540]  about the groping a little girl and we've got the article here my Aaron Dykes

[1:00:52.900 --> 1:01:01.140]  continue with your phone calls today we'll open the phones up after the the
[1:01:01.140 --> 1:01:06.580]  next guest joins us we'll have a full open phones in the third hour today to
[1:01:06.580 --> 1:01:10.500]  talk about Obama wanting to raise taxes and get rid a lot of the tax write-offs
[1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:15.380]  and he's using the attack on him with general electric not paying any taxes
[1:01:15.380 --> 1:01:20.300]  to say see we need to tax the rich but general electric and all the big bankers
[1:01:20.300 --> 1:01:24.260]  are still going to be exempt because they wrote the laws and then your
[1:01:24.260 --> 1:01:29.340]  neighbor or your boss that's making 125,000 a year they're gonna raise their
[1:01:29.340 --> 1:01:33.020]  taxes and they're just gonna lower your pay or let you go and the economy will
[1:01:33.020 --> 1:01:39.380]  continue to implode you know Kennedy cut one tax bracket by half the next
[1:01:39.380 --> 1:01:47.220]  bracket by 36% if you pull up those numbers from 1961 and the next year and
[1:01:47.220 --> 1:01:54.060]  for the next three years tax receipts doubled the government knows this when
[1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:57.780]  California continually raises taxes and their economy and their deficits get
[1:01:57.780 --> 1:02:01.460]  bigger that's what the private banks that are running things want they want
[1:02:01.460 --> 1:02:05.020]  them to go totally under like a third world country so the banks can come in
[1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:12.700]  and buy it all up for days on the dollar it's the old old story of you pay it on
[1:02:12.700 --> 1:02:18.460]  a farm for 19 years this is the last year's payments you've got enough to pay
[1:02:18.460 --> 1:02:24.260]  it monthly but there's a clause that they can demand the whole year in the last
[1:02:24.260 --> 1:02:28.780]  year and they come to you and they say you got 30 days to give us the entire
[1:02:28.780 --> 1:02:35.460]  amount of the farm you don't have the money so you go around trying to sell part
[1:02:35.460 --> 1:02:41.940]  of the farm to pay it and the local banks work together to make sure that
[1:02:41.940 --> 1:02:48.060]  nobody gives a buyer a loan and then after paying 19 years on that farm they
[1:02:48.060 --> 1:02:54.660]  come and they take it and if you don't go off of it guess who shows up the
[1:02:54.660 --> 1:03:00.500]  sheriff or the constable and if you don't come out of that house well they're
[1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:04.980]  gonna go in that's what SWAT teams in the modern day or four now in the old
[1:03:04.980 --> 1:03:08.580]  times there were a lot of counties and places where they wouldn't do that and
[1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:17.060]  where bankers tried stuff like that well it might be five years later but they'd
[1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:22.220]  be walking down the middle of the street and they get knocked on the head or
[1:03:22.220 --> 1:03:30.100]  worse but see people aren't red-blooded anymore and so we're getting
[1:03:30.100 --> 1:03:34.420]  run over and the globalists are testing us can they take our babies blood at
[1:03:34.420 --> 1:03:40.740]  birth can they put poison in our water radioactive isotopes fluoride can they
[1:03:40.740 --> 1:03:45.380]  stick their hands on our children's pants can they steal trillions of
[1:03:45.380 --> 1:03:50.180]  dollars can they take the veterans death benefits and the answer is yes we want to
[1:03:50.180 --> 1:03:55.420]  be raped and their answer is okay we're gonna do it harder than we're gonna take
[1:03:55.420 --> 1:04:02.180]  more of what you got we're gonna run over you we're gonna restrict your free
[1:04:02.180 --> 1:04:10.900]  speech how's that sound well we feel powerless go ahead and so things get
[1:04:10.900 --> 1:04:17.180]  crazier and crazier by the minute but we're gonna be going over screening of
[1:04:17.180 --> 1:04:28.780]  six-year-old there is a TSA statement saying this is standard procedure they
[1:04:28.780 --> 1:04:32.300]  say the drug test that the TSA minion talks about could have been an
[1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:36.820]  explosive trace detection test and they line say it's standard I have them in
[1:04:36.820 --> 1:04:44.660]  USA today last year saying they weren't gonna screen children under 12
[1:04:44.660 --> 1:04:51.460]  official statement from an official lie and by the way those of you that say
[1:04:51.460 --> 1:04:54.140]  well if you don't like being broke go through the scanner they all went

[1:06:03.020 --> 1:06:07.460]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:06:07.460 --> 1:06:11.660]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:06:11.660 --> 1:06:15.700]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:06:15.700 --> 1:06:19.580]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:06:19.580 --> 1:06:23.580]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:06:23.580 --> 1:06:28.020]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:06:28.020 --> 1:06:32.340]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:06:32.340 --> 1:06:36.060]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[1:06:36.060 --> 1:06:40.220]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[1:06:40.220 --> 1:06:43.580]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[1:08:03.540 --> 1:08:09.060]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:08:11.980 --> 1:08:18.180]  here are some of the headlines right now today now well into the second hour
[1:08:18.180 --> 1:08:26.780]  Thursday the 14th day of April 2011 Obama Vayner budget deal increases the
[1:08:26.780 --> 1:08:31.260]  deficit that's one of the headlines we're gonna be going over also nuclear
[1:08:31.260 --> 1:08:38.100]  expert Fukushima 1000 times worse than engineers ever anticipated it's many
[1:08:38.100 --> 1:08:43.060]  times worse than Chernobyl as we told you a month ago many times worse than
[1:08:43.060 --> 1:08:47.900]  Chernobyl much larger reactors much larger explosions much higher
[1:08:47.900 --> 1:08:52.140]  levels of radiation and the US government's response is to raise
[1:08:52.140 --> 1:08:57.740]  radiation levels between 1000 and 100,000 times previous levels that they
[1:08:57.740 --> 1:09:02.820]  call normal that's on the EPA site depending on the isotope 1000 to 100
[1:09:02.820 --> 1:09:06.660]  thousand times safe levels with top nuclear engineers and experts saying
[1:09:06.660 --> 1:09:13.700]  Fukushima is 1000 times worse than engineers ever anticipated we're gonna
[1:09:13.700 --> 1:09:18.980]  be breaking that down also globalist position to exploit Japan's tragedy
[1:09:18.980 --> 1:09:24.220]  another key report I'm gonna get into here in a moment busted TSA lied about
[1:09:24.220 --> 1:09:30.100]  promise not to grope children also the term Alex Jones tops Google trends
[1:09:30.100 --> 1:09:36.260]  yesterday but six-year-old groped blocked from rank we see we did both those as a
[1:09:36.260 --> 1:09:41.020]  test and more and more we've done a lot of TSA searches now and we're noticing
[1:09:41.020 --> 1:09:45.100]  they're blocked so they've got some type of algorithm we know the TSA pays
[1:09:45.100 --> 1:09:49.500]  Google as anybody can do but it takes a lot of VP got caught doing this as well
[1:09:49.500 --> 1:09:54.940]  to totally dominate the first few pages of search results that way that you when
[1:09:54.940 --> 1:09:58.460]  somebody searches TSA they don't find all the hardcore news and that
[1:09:58.460 --> 1:10:02.620]  undoubtedly is going on and we've got a report on that up at prisonplanet.com
[1:10:02.620 --> 1:10:09.140]  also we're gonna get into much of northern Japan maybe unhabitable to the
[1:10:09.140 --> 1:10:14.540]  nuclear radiation that's all at prisonplanet.com but let me get to this
[1:10:14.540 --> 1:10:21.140]  first right now this is the TSA's response and now there's a bunch of new
[1:10:21.140 --> 1:10:23.780]  videos coming out of small children having the government stick their hands
[1:10:23.780 --> 1:10:28.460]  down their pants as prisoner enslavement training and they just do it with a
[1:10:28.460 --> 1:10:32.660]  straight face it's violation of the 10th Amendment federal goons no
[1:10:32.660 --> 1:10:36.300]  jurisdiction doing it it's a violation of federal and state law we've had
[1:10:36.300 --> 1:10:40.340]  district attorneys members of legislatures on to break that down they
[1:10:40.340 --> 1:10:45.380]  just don't care it's huge power grab violates your space your rights it
[1:10:45.380 --> 1:10:50.180]  violates laws on groping on molestation they don't care they just do it they
[1:10:50.180 --> 1:10:54.300]  don't follow the radiation laws on radiology there's no testing no controls
[1:10:54.300 --> 1:10:58.780]  they don't care just like they have police and military now all over the US
[1:10:58.780 --> 1:11:02.860]  I've got one newscast at upstate New York where it says the National Guard helped
[1:11:02.860 --> 1:11:08.220]  arrest 2,000 people this year for drugs alcohol and weapons at random
[1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:12.420]  checkpoints and it says we have the people drive under the x-ray and it's a
[1:11:12.420 --> 1:11:15.820]  huge high-powered x-ray that shoots through a car and it shows the people
[1:11:15.820 --> 1:11:20.260]  inside I mean it's far beyond far beyond according to radiologists we've
[1:11:20.260 --> 1:11:24.580]  interviewed between 10 and 100 times a chest x-ray and they're just troops just
[1:11:24.580 --> 1:11:33.580]  standing there three feet under it just I'm gonna be dead soon I mean again more
[1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:38.900]  and more I realize it's it's the globalists are insane I mean they are
[1:11:38.900 --> 1:11:43.900]  just they don't care they love to destroy things I go back to 20 years ago
[1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:48.180]  when all the Army's own manuals we've read the manuals on air had the writer
[1:11:48.180 --> 1:11:53.580]  of the manuals they had of the Pentagon DU program Doug Rocky on I want to get
[1:11:53.580 --> 1:11:59.060]  him back on but he's been in the hospital let's contact him he couldn't talk
[1:11:59.060 --> 1:12:04.700]  to us two weeks goes at the VA from all his DU poisoning but and then 91 they
[1:12:04.700 --> 1:12:08.580]  just said we're now saying no restrictions no decontamination troops
[1:12:08.580 --> 1:12:12.540]  could just use it everywhere it's fine and they're walking dead folks and the
[1:12:12.540 --> 1:12:18.340]  system this stuff makes dioxin and Agent Orange look like mother's milk the
[1:12:18.340 --> 1:12:24.540]  rounds ignite when they leave the barrel you get a deadly dose if you get one
[1:12:24.540 --> 1:12:34.340]  microgram of it they don't care they like it they like it that's what I'm
[1:12:34.340 --> 1:12:38.380]  saying about these people are now I'm ranting I mean the TSA workers are
[1:12:38.380 --> 1:12:41.340]  standing around this radiation all day but that's nothing compared to the
[1:12:41.340 --> 1:12:46.860]  highway units in Tennessee in Texas in California in New York I got local news
[1:12:46.860 --> 1:12:51.700]  cast showing people driving under high-powered x-rays with these big
[1:12:51.700 --> 1:12:55.420]  giant wands that come off the top of the truck and that the trucks and the
[1:12:55.420 --> 1:12:59.380]  vans and this and the and the people in their cars they have them I mean just a
[1:12:59.380 --> 1:13:02.980]  few years ago they had machines you had to drive up in you got out of the car
[1:13:02.980 --> 1:13:06.780]  and the border patrol gets behind shielding and then they drive it through
[1:13:06.780 --> 1:13:11.100]  a scanner now I'm seeing video and news footage from the border down in Texas
[1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:15.060]  where it just shows the border patrols standing around by mobile scanners you
[1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:20.100]  guys are dead you're gonna get testicular cancer because that's on the
[1:13:20.100 --> 1:13:24.020]  outside of your body and also very susceptible to cancer you're gonna get
[1:13:24.020 --> 1:13:28.100]  I mean you're dead I mean you're dead and you don't care I'm telling you it's
[1:13:28.100 --> 1:13:34.420]  funny I know it's funny funny funny funny funny isn't it because I'm not
[1:13:34.420 --> 1:13:42.260]  insane like you I'm not a nutcase you people think you got uniforms on it
[1:13:42.260 --> 1:13:47.260]  blocks the radiation out and there's thousands of studies the cell phones are
[1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:51.060]  giving us brain tumors and there's all these big studies about the radar guns
[1:13:51.060 --> 1:13:54.940]  the cops stick between their legs that are broadcasting at a lower level even
[1:13:54.940 --> 1:13:57.980]  when they're not pulling the trigger and then and in the cops I've seen the
[1:13:57.980 --> 1:14:01.780]  statistics three times more likely if they're a radar cop to get testicular
[1:14:01.780 --> 1:14:06.020]  cancer you don't care you think it's fun to go in and have them chopped off okay
[1:14:06.020 --> 1:14:11.900]  laugh at me laugh laugh laugh laugh about dollar default laugh about depression

[1:14:41.460 --> 1:14:46.220]  truth would suit them better because every time I watch this video this six
[1:14:46.220 --> 1:14:48.780]  year old girl you hear some other kid going daddy I don't want him to touch
[1:14:48.780 --> 1:14:54.020]  me from behind whoever's videotaping and to learn that they bucked up and

[1:15:21.900 --> 1:15:26.260]  you got angry by government saying you can't pack your kids lunch anytime you
[1:15:26.260 --> 1:15:29.940]  got angry when you're treated like a slave anytime you started acting like a
[1:15:29.940 --> 1:15:35.740]  red-blooded free creature anytime the spirit of this nation changed if we'd
[1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:41.260]  hit our knees and repent and if we don't believe in God you ought to repent to the
[1:15:41.260 --> 1:15:46.260]  universe you ought to repent to yourself to fellow mankind that you've been such
[1:15:46.260 --> 1:15:51.060]  a jellyfish you ought to say this is wrong I want to change I want to be
[1:15:51.060 --> 1:15:54.420]  better and it doesn't mean you're gonna change the world overnight but it's that
[1:15:54.420 --> 1:16:00.820]  change of attitude again if you don't believe in spiritual things what's a
[1:16:00.820 --> 1:16:05.420]  pep rally for before a game get the spirit up get the attitude up get a
[1:16:05.420 --> 1:16:10.900]  different attitude about you that's what we need but instead the globalist are
[1:16:10.900 --> 1:16:15.620]  selling us on an attitude of servile safety obsessed oh I I don't have any
[1:16:15.620 --> 1:16:19.180]  rights to be safe the government wears these black uniforms and does all these
[1:16:19.180 --> 1:16:23.380]  things to me to keep me safe and and this fetish for people going well it is
[1:16:23.380 --> 1:16:28.100]  the law no it's not the law most of some constitutional garbage well we've got
[1:16:28.100 --> 1:16:32.340]  to do it we got to pay our fair share or the economy's gonna collapse when all
[1:16:32.340 --> 1:16:36.700]  your income tax money goes to interest on the debt from the day it started for

[1:17:56.900 --> 1:18:02.260]  procedures were followed yes TSA has reviewed the incident and the security
[1:18:02.260 --> 1:18:05.500]  officer in the video followed the current standard operating procedures
[1:18:05.500 --> 1:18:09.140]  which are not written in our secret course they don't have that with that
[1:18:09.140 --> 1:18:12.860]  said you may have read recently that our administrators looking into ways to move
[1:18:12.860 --> 1:18:16.460]  past the cookie-cutter approach to screening recognizing that terrorists
[1:18:16.460 --> 1:18:20.580]  are willing to manipulate social norms to evade detection yet now they're
[1:18:20.580 --> 1:18:24.500]  talking in Australia about full-body x-rays at their at their airports and
[1:18:24.500 --> 1:18:28.740]  sometimes they may do a proctology exam oh we weren't joking years ago we said
[1:18:28.740 --> 1:18:33.020]  next they want their hands in your body it's like what you don't like your six

[1:18:49.100 --> 1:18:52.420]  younger passengers while still maintaining a high level of security and
[1:18:52.420 --> 1:18:55.140]  you know the globalists are gonna lead some little kid on a plane and blow him
[1:18:55.140 --> 1:18:58.020]  up on a plane and it'll even be on the news that the US government got him on
[1:18:58.020 --> 1:19:00.740]  board and then and we're all hockey was there at the Pentagon running it and
[1:19:00.740 --> 1:19:04.580]  then people be like well just ignore that okay al-Qaeda did run it and the

[1:23:59.980 --> 1:24:10.620]  look to simplify it this is what's happening globalist psychological warfare
[1:24:10.620 --> 1:24:18.460]  experts in their own missions they are engineering the world population to be
[1:24:18.460 --> 1:24:23.580]  unthinking spectators who regurgitate whatever they're told and they're
[1:24:23.580 --> 1:24:28.820]  changing our societal norms by moving what is known as the overton window to
[1:24:28.820 --> 1:24:34.220]  the extreme where we will accept anything that's why 39 years ago they
[1:24:34.220 --> 1:24:36.620]  wouldn't tell you they were taking blood from babies secretly when they
[1:24:36.620 --> 1:24:42.540]  started it now they'll tell you yeah we took blood secretly shut up yeah big
[1:24:42.540 --> 1:24:47.100]  mega banks launder hundreds of billions in drug money a year shut up yeah
[1:24:47.100 --> 1:24:51.140]  we're taking the veterans pension funds shut up yeah we're gonna stick our
[1:24:51.140 --> 1:24:55.660]  hands down you and your family's pants shut up it's for your own good and
[1:24:55.660 --> 1:25:00.140]  they're building an army of people who have psychologically given into the
[1:25:00.140 --> 1:25:03.540]  tyranny and then who defend it see somebody who goes along with evil
[1:25:03.540 --> 1:25:07.860]  doesn't just kind of halfway go along with it they then become defenders of
[1:25:07.860 --> 1:25:11.780]  it because in their little delusional world it must be okay and you're the
[1:25:11.780 --> 1:25:17.220]  bad person for pointing out that they're wrong and that's exactly what the TSA has
[1:25:17.220 --> 1:25:21.180]  become is a bunch of crooks and I've had district attorneys on this show breaking
[1:25:21.180 --> 1:25:23.860]  down that if they catch them sticking their hands down a child's pants they're
[1:25:23.860 --> 1:25:27.820]  gonna go to jail well where are those district attorneys now because this
[1:25:27.820 --> 1:25:33.220]  stuff's going on everywhere misdemeanor on the outside felony on the inside we
[1:25:33.220 --> 1:25:38.340]  got video on the inside of the pants every day new videos out today going on
[1:25:38.340 --> 1:25:42.020]  at every major airport and if you don't want to imagine you don't want to stick
[1:25:42.020 --> 1:25:44.980]  your their hands down your pants or your children you're sitting there and
[1:25:44.980 --> 1:25:50.620]  they're just like then leave and then when you try to leave they charge you for
[1:25:50.620 --> 1:25:54.500]  leaving a screening I mean these are criminals and to them it's a fun little
[1:25:54.500 --> 1:25:58.780]  thing hey we rig the game hey we're criminals isn't this fun oh we're
[1:25:58.780 --> 1:26:04.300]  fighting al-qaeda sure you are run from the Pentagon publicly but oh we're not
[1:26:04.300 --> 1:26:10.260]  supposed to look at those admissions and here is Aaron Dyke's article that I
[1:26:10.260 --> 1:26:15.060]  want to get out to everybody busted TSA lied you know what the Google search
[1:26:15.060 --> 1:26:18.460]  term worked for Alex Jones let's do a test today and this will pretty much
[1:26:18.460 --> 1:26:23.300]  confirm it because there's no doubt we can make any term we want number one
[1:26:23.300 --> 1:26:31.060]  let's Google TSA just the letters together all caps TSA lied that's very
[1:26:31.060 --> 1:26:35.100]  simple let's make it number one if by the way our other TSA search term didn't
[1:26:35.100 --> 1:26:40.780]  even show up yesterday then I had the bright idea to say Alex Jones that made
[1:26:40.780 --> 1:26:44.700]  it through number one search term let's let's let's let's let's let's let's
[1:26:44.700 --> 1:26:48.820]  finally prove today that something's going on that we can investigate more
[1:26:48.820 --> 1:26:54.900]  TSA lied L I E D great job by the way yesterday making the other search term
[1:26:54.900 --> 1:27:04.060]  number one TSA lied lied lied two words TSA or one abbreviation and then lied
[1:27:04.060 --> 1:27:10.140]  TSA lie TSA lie TSA lie hit him hit him hit him hit him hit him art busted TSA
[1:27:10.140 --> 1:27:15.060]  lied about promise not to grow up children TSA has defended the groping of
[1:27:15.060 --> 1:27:19.220]  a six-year-old girl saying it followed policy well was it policy to shoot
[1:27:19.220 --> 1:27:23.220]  people in the back of the head in Nazi Germany is that okay to or policy to kill
[1:27:23.220 --> 1:27:27.420]  whole villages in Afghanistan yeah it is according to the Ithaca Times Ithaca
[1:27:27.420 --> 1:27:33.180]  journal yet in November 2010 just six months ago or five months ago TSA
[1:27:33.180 --> 1:27:37.420]  vowed no enhanced pat downs for children under 12 and there's the USA today
[1:27:37.420 --> 1:27:42.140]  headline we have for you right there screenshotted the transportation
[1:27:42.140 --> 1:27:45.460]  security administration TSA contradicted itself even to the point of
[1:27:45.460 --> 1:27:48.380]  outright lying and responding to the controversy about a six-year-old girl
[1:27:48.380 --> 1:27:51.940]  who received a groping pat down after already being sent through a body
[1:27:51.940 --> 1:27:56.380]  scanner a roaster the video went viral after appearing on the drudge report
[1:27:56.380 --> 1:28:01.360]  comm many other sites TSA typically explained away this unnerving
[1:28:01.360 --> 1:28:05.460]  experience that left the girl in tears by arguing that the action is perfectly
[1:28:05.460 --> 1:28:11.940]  normal follows all procedures and keeps us safe from terrorism oh like the
[1:28:11.940 --> 1:28:16.260]  underwear bomber being got on the plane by the State Department you see the TSA
[1:28:16.260 --> 1:28:20.660]  rationalize in its latest defense that terrorists this is a quote are willing to
[1:28:20.660 --> 1:28:27.460]  manipulate societal norms to evade detection hmm oh yes when they're being
[1:28:27.460 --> 1:28:30.820]  gotten on the airplanes and protected in every case just like the shoe bomber
[1:28:30.820 --> 1:28:35.980]  underwear bomber all run by locky under Pentagon Command Ox News AP but let's
[1:28:35.980 --> 1:28:41.060]  just ignore that information thus TSA would have it we must abandon societal
[1:28:41.060 --> 1:28:45.260]  norms and laws like touching children in their private parts and instead subject
[1:28:45.260 --> 1:28:49.460]  them to pre-crime inspections according to logic no woman and child little old
[1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:53.180]  ladies or men handicapped in wheelchairs or implanted with modern medical
[1:28:53.180 --> 1:28:58.580]  devices nobody cavity or private part is safe from extensive probing by the
[1:28:58.580 --> 1:29:04.020]  guardians in government as the Justice Department recently proclaimed the TSA
[1:29:04.020 --> 1:29:08.100]  assumes the authority to literally strip search people on demand oh they said we
[1:29:08.100 --> 1:29:10.900]  can strip search you and while they're strip searching you in every major
[1:29:10.900 --> 1:29:21.540]  airport they've been caught robbing your bags oh and it goes on and on this
[1:29:21.540 --> 1:29:27.300]  article needs to get out everywhere let's hit them and let's hit them hard
[1:29:27.300 --> 1:29:38.900]  TSA lied TSA lied TSA lied TSA lied your liars and I'm calling you out

[1:35:37.060 --> 1:35:40.700]  about moving away from the dollar and I wanted to discuss with an economic
[1:35:40.700 --> 1:35:44.220]  expert the effects that that will have you're already seeing dollar
[1:35:44.220 --> 1:35:49.100]  devaluation causing commodities to go up energy to go up and hence everything
[1:35:49.100 --> 1:35:54.980]  else that's delivered going up and we've seen all these big headlines out of
[1:35:54.980 --> 1:36:03.380]  Reuters and out of voice of America bricks nations opposed use of force in
[1:36:03.380 --> 1:36:09.860]  Libya and you got China Russia India and others involved in all of this and so
[1:36:09.860 --> 1:36:17.100]  joining us is Mark Wisebrot who is again also writes a weekly column for the
[1:36:17.100 --> 1:36:23.860]  Guardian Unlimited and he also is president of just foreign policy the
[1:36:23.860 --> 1:36:28.700]  website is cepr.net thank you for coming on with us sure thank you my
[1:36:28.700 --> 1:36:32.300]  pleasure so much is happening break down for those that don't know what bricks
[1:36:32.300 --> 1:36:39.580]  is and some of the big moves they're engaged in yes well I think you know
[1:36:39.580 --> 1:36:44.300]  they represent about half the world's population about a 20% of the output in
[1:36:44.300 --> 1:36:49.620]  the world and so you know they're just another force in what's becoming them
[1:36:49.620 --> 1:36:54.820]  and increasingly I would say multi polar world and I think that's a good
[1:36:54.820 --> 1:36:58.260]  thing really I think will all as Americans will be better off the more
[1:36:58.260 --> 1:37:03.380]  this happens why because the private corporate interest running us as their
[1:37:03.380 --> 1:37:06.940]  private credit card and military force won't be able to just do whatever they
[1:37:06.940 --> 1:37:11.580]  want that's exactly right I mean we don't really benefit from having an
[1:37:11.580 --> 1:37:19.620]  empire in the world and so anybody who's you know trying to end that you know as
[1:37:19.620 --> 1:37:24.780]  long as they're not using violence which these countries are not they're
[1:37:24.780 --> 1:37:28.900]  helping us I mean we might even get health care in this country once we
[1:37:28.900 --> 1:37:34.940]  finally stop spending all our money on wars that's right what the current
[1:37:34.940 --> 1:37:38.500]  defense budgets over a trillion supplemental 800 billion almost two
[1:37:38.500 --> 1:37:42.540]  trillion bucks going into this black hole every year yeah and it's it's a
[1:37:42.540 --> 1:37:47.100]  huge waste and it's making enemies all over the world I mean you look at how
[1:37:47.100 --> 1:37:52.860]  people in Pakistan are hating us because they're you know civilians are
[1:37:52.860 --> 1:37:59.580]  being killed there you know every week by these drone bombings and you know it's
[1:37:59.580 --> 1:38:04.460]  just we have so many wars now between Afghanistan Pakistan Iraq
[1:38:04.460 --> 1:38:09.700]  now Libya it's just you we don't know where it ends and so I think it's good
[1:38:09.700 --> 1:38:15.260]  that the BRIC countries decided to take a position against the Western
[1:38:15.260 --> 1:38:21.540]  intervention in Libya and more importantly for a negotiated solution
[1:38:21.540 --> 1:38:25.940]  because that's what you're you're gonna need and I think you know Brazil in
[1:38:25.940 --> 1:38:28.780]  particular which is one of the BRIC countries I mean they've always been
[1:38:28.780 --> 1:38:35.020]  pushing for these kinds of solutions they prefer to use diplomacy rather than
[1:38:35.020 --> 1:38:41.100]  force looking at their big announcements dealing with the dollar
[1:38:41.100 --> 1:38:47.340]  somebody who researches this mark break down what these new bold announcements
[1:38:47.340 --> 1:38:53.020]  signify in your opinion well I don't think it's gonna mean that much you know
[1:38:53.020 --> 1:38:58.820]  the dollar was about 61% of reserve holdings in the world that is all
[1:38:58.820 --> 1:39:04.660]  countries have to hold well we don't but most countries have to hold foreign
[1:39:04.660 --> 1:39:11.100]  exchange reserves and about 61% that was dollars last year that was about the
[1:39:11.100 --> 1:39:17.380]  same as a year before so I think in the long run it will decline but it's not
[1:39:17.380 --> 1:39:22.060]  going to happen that fast and it won't have a drastic any real drastic effect
[1:39:22.060 --> 1:39:29.140]  on the u.s. if countries switch more to other currencies over time it won't hurt
[1:39:29.140 --> 1:39:35.020]  us in fact there are a lot of downsides to being the world's currency one of
[1:39:35.020 --> 1:39:41.800]  which is that you know it we tend to have an overvalued currency and that
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:45.460]  means that you know we've lost six million manufacturing jobs in the last
[1:39:45.460 --> 1:39:50.900]  ten years and most of that is really due to our currency being overvalued now
[1:39:50.900 --> 1:39:55.860]  of course if we had a government that was responsible to the majority and not
[1:39:55.860 --> 1:40:00.820]  so much the Wall Street we would have a more competitive currency and we wouldn't
[1:40:00.820 --> 1:40:04.540]  have lost all those jobs well sure mark I mean there's a lot of factors
[1:40:04.540 --> 1:40:07.940]  obviously feeding into deindustrialization and now even loss of
[1:40:07.940 --> 1:40:11.020]  the quote new service economy that was going to be so great but there's a
[1:40:11.020 --> 1:40:15.020]  method of this madness I mean even if the dollar is devalued and that encourages
[1:40:15.020 --> 1:40:19.660]  some you know new production in this country overall China and India and
[1:40:19.660 --> 1:40:24.460]  others are still so much further below us that I don't see that having as big of
[1:40:24.460 --> 1:40:29.980]  as a positive effect as some have been saying well I think it's very big I mean
[1:40:29.980 --> 1:40:38.580]  if the dollar is a 25% overvalued that's just like putting a tariff tariff on all
[1:40:38.580 --> 1:40:45.020]  our goods that we're trying to export and a subsidizing for 25% everybody who
[1:40:45.020 --> 1:40:47.860]  wants to export to the United States and that's the kind of thing we've been
[1:40:47.860 --> 1:40:52.580]  doing for a long time so yeah I think that you know obviously we're not going
[1:40:52.580 --> 1:40:57.500]  to compete in some areas where cheap labor is the biggest thing but in in in
[1:40:57.500 --> 1:41:02.980]  areas where technology and productivity increases are a bigger part of the story
[1:41:02.980 --> 1:41:07.420]  we would have we would have a lot of those jobs I would say that's the
[1:41:07.420 --> 1:41:11.740]  biggest cause I mean the trade agreements like NAFTA and WTO those hurt a
[1:41:11.740 --> 1:41:16.820]  lot too but but I would say the dollar the currency is even bigger than that
[1:41:16.820 --> 1:41:21.980]  again if you just joined us Mark Wisebrot is our guest the co-director of
[1:41:21.980 --> 1:41:25.820]  the Center for Economic and Public Policy is a PhD in economics from the
[1:41:25.820 --> 1:41:28.940]  University of Michigan he is the co-author with Dean Baker of Social
[1:41:28.940 --> 1:41:33.020]  Security the phony crisis University of Chicago Press and has written numerous
[1:41:33.020 --> 1:41:36.260]  research papers on economic policy he writes a weekly column for the Guardian
[1:41:36.260 --> 1:41:40.700]  also McClatchy newspapers and over 500 newspapers he also writes a column for
[1:41:40.700 --> 1:41:44.020]  Brazil's largest newspaper his opinion pieces have appeared in the Washington
[1:41:44.020 --> 1:41:49.300]  Post Los Angeles Times the Boston Globe in major U.S. newspapers and he has
[1:41:49.300 --> 1:41:57.060]  most recently authored the scorecard on development closing the gap bottom line
[1:41:57.060 --> 1:42:02.140]  you know heading up the CEPR prestigious organization and your views are
[1:42:02.140 --> 1:42:06.740]  widely respected what is the health of the American Empire and the gaggle of
[1:42:06.740 --> 1:42:13.060]  insider corporations that basically use us as a very dangerous
[1:42:13.060 --> 1:42:18.700]  juggernaut marionette to carry out their aims because I'm seeing more and more
[1:42:18.700 --> 1:42:26.500]  just insane wild hubris filled actions by this system almost fleeing forward
[1:42:26.500 --> 1:42:33.100]  with bravada right now well I think the Empire if you put it in those terms is
[1:42:33.100 --> 1:42:38.980]  falling apart at a rate that is unprecedented and as I said I think
[1:42:38.980 --> 1:42:44.620]  that's a good thing in the sense that it hurts us we don't need to be spending
[1:42:44.620 --> 1:42:49.420]  this kind of money on military we don't need to be making enemies which then
[1:42:49.420 --> 1:42:53.500]  kind of you know it perpetuates a cycle where there's violence against the
[1:42:53.500 --> 1:42:57.540]  United States and it denies us a lot of things that people with other high-income
[1:42:57.540 --> 1:43:02.900]  countries have like health care high-speed internet how do you see the
[1:43:02.900 --> 1:43:07.060]  unraveling of the Empire then what are some of the different avenues that you
[1:43:07.060 --> 1:43:10.740]  see it degenerating through because I mean normally an empire is going to try
[1:43:10.740 --> 1:43:15.060]  to start not just regional wars but a wider war to try to keep that power and
[1:43:15.060 --> 1:43:19.500]  if it does implode all the tentacles of mercenaries and parasites are going to
[1:43:19.500 --> 1:43:23.860]  come back home and it seems that's their rearguard action to at least if they
[1:43:23.860 --> 1:43:28.740]  can't rule the globe can't rule in heaven rural in hell satan once was
[1:43:28.740 --> 1:43:34.060]  reportedly said you're coming back here to rule us well I think we're going to
[1:43:34.060 --> 1:43:37.740]  get out of Afghanistan it's going to take public pressure here at home I mean
[1:43:37.740 --> 1:43:42.260]  that's the thing we don't have we have a very limited form of democracy but we
[1:43:42.260 --> 1:43:47.980]  do have elections and and that makes a difference and I think we're going to get
[1:43:47.980 --> 1:43:51.860]  out of Afghanistan we're going to leave Iraq but they have to be pushed I mean
[1:43:51.860 --> 1:43:56.780]  they want to stay you know the military actually it's interesting I think the
[1:43:56.780 --> 1:44:00.980]  military is not anxious to get into new wars you saw what Robert Gates said
[1:44:00.980 --> 1:44:06.740]  about Libya he was not interested he was not very anxious to to participate in
[1:44:06.740 --> 1:44:12.340]  Libya doesn't have 500 billion a year in opium sure what but once they get in
[1:44:12.340 --> 1:44:17.020]  the problem is once they get in they don't want to leave as a matter of
[1:44:17.020 --> 1:44:20.100]  professional pride they don't want to leave until they have something that they
[1:44:20.100 --> 1:44:25.740]  can call a victory even if it isn't and so that's part of the reason we're
[1:44:25.740 --> 1:44:31.740]  still in Afghanistan I think they pressured Obama and on that one but I
[1:44:31.740 --> 1:44:36.740]  think you are going to see more and more people the United States will get
[1:44:36.740 --> 1:44:40.100]  fed up with it that's really what has to happen because the foreign policy
[1:44:40.100 --> 1:44:44.940]  establishment in this country they are committed to running the world and
[1:44:44.940 --> 1:44:51.100]  that's you know that's something that just doesn't change from your research
[1:44:51.100 --> 1:44:56.740]  who's driving this Anglo-American attempt at world government to all of our
[1:44:56.740 --> 1:45:02.020]  individual detriment inside the Imperium I mean who are the main drivers and
[1:45:02.020 --> 1:45:06.820]  and what is their end game if they're successful I think it's a I think it's
[1:45:06.820 --> 1:45:11.580]  more political than economic actually you can see this in a lot of case you
[1:45:11.580 --> 1:45:14.680]  know for example in Venezuela where the United States have been trying to
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:19.620]  overthrow that government since 2002 the big oil companies didn't really care
[1:45:19.620 --> 1:45:24.420]  it was and they're pretty powerful corporation for most of that period the
[1:45:24.420 --> 1:45:31.260]  two biggest Exxon and Exxon mobile and Chevron really didn't want to do it it
[1:45:31.260 --> 1:45:35.020]  was really coming from the State Department and I think that's what I
[1:45:35.020 --> 1:45:39.020]  mean by the foreign policy establishment you have the State Department you have
[1:45:39.020 --> 1:45:42.380]  the whole National Security establishment you have the Council on Foreign
[1:45:42.380 --> 1:45:46.460]  Relations you have all of these groups that you know there's differences of
[1:45:46.460 --> 1:45:50.340]  pay obviously a lot of them didn't think were against the invasion of Iraq for
[1:45:50.340 --> 1:45:57.500]  example but nonetheless they hold this view that any loss of power the United
[1:45:57.500 --> 1:46:02.380]  States over other countries is a big loss that has to be regained by any
[1:46:02.380 --> 1:46:07.820]  means necessary that's their basic view and because of that for example they'll
[1:46:07.820 --> 1:46:12.500]  support a war that they don't even want just so they can call it a victory and
[1:46:12.500 --> 1:46:16.900]  I think that's the real problem now you do have I mean over you also have
[1:46:16.900 --> 1:46:20.740]  obviously you have the military industrial complex you have individual
[1:46:20.740 --> 1:46:24.500]  corporations with their particular interests and those are very important
[1:46:24.500 --> 1:46:31.860]  too but I would put them second to the to the State Department in its allies
[1:46:31.860 --> 1:46:36.820]  and you know the press is part of this too the media is a huge part of it I you
[1:46:36.820 --> 1:46:40.860]  know that's why I appreciate this show because you really don't have in this
[1:46:40.860 --> 1:46:47.260]  country in the media you really don't have an independent civil society on
[1:46:47.260 --> 1:46:51.340]  foreign policy issues that's represented in the media it's it's kind of like
[1:46:51.340 --> 1:46:57.060]  Russia where everybody you see on the television on the major stations and
[1:46:57.060 --> 1:47:01.180]  networks is either a government official a former government official or
[1:47:01.180 --> 1:47:04.420]  somebody who's getting money from the government and that's not true on a lot
[1:47:04.420 --> 1:47:07.940]  of other issues but it's really true on the foreign policy issues well isn't it
[1:47:07.940 --> 1:47:13.060]  also revolving door in banking and military with the generals going into
[1:47:13.060 --> 1:47:18.100]  the defense jobs so it's really delayed payoffs with the former Goldman Sachs
[1:47:18.100 --> 1:47:22.060]  JP Morgan going into government then back into the banks I mean it's just an
[1:47:22.060 --> 1:47:26.500]  inside really crony capitalist system that isn't free market that's
[1:47:26.500 --> 1:47:31.180]  absolutely right it's a massive level of corruption and you know it's interesting
[1:47:31.180 --> 1:47:34.620]  because you know the IMF and the World Bank especially are always complaining
[1:47:34.620 --> 1:47:38.700]  about corruption in other countries and developing countries in particular but
[1:47:38.700 --> 1:47:43.340]  really the word just as corrupt it just takes a different form like you said
[1:47:43.340 --> 1:47:48.540]  it's a delayed payment you go from you know from the from the Treasury
[1:47:48.540 --> 1:47:53.820]  Department the Goldman Sachs and back and forth and and you know that that's or
[1:47:53.820 --> 1:47:58.140]  even the Fed for the for example and you know that there's that payment for you
[1:47:58.140 --> 1:48:02.700]  and you're that if that affects your decisions on financial regulation and
[1:48:02.700 --> 1:48:07.580]  everything else and of course in the military industrial complex you've had
[1:48:07.580 --> 1:48:11.620]  this for decades the revolving door between the Pentagon and the consultants
[1:48:11.620 --> 1:48:19.900]  and and it's it's really a deep all pervasive level of corruption and of
[1:48:19.900 --> 1:48:24.500]  course includes the financing of our elections as well which is just a kind
[1:48:24.500 --> 1:48:30.860]  of legalized bribery as I'm sure you know so this is these are deep problems
[1:48:30.860 --> 1:48:36.980]  but I will say having said all that I'm not as pessimistic as some people are
[1:48:36.980 --> 1:48:45.420]  because I do think that ultimately you do have a lot of activity for example we
[1:48:45.420 --> 1:48:49.540]  are going to get out of Afghanistan and when we do it will be because you don't
[1:48:49.540 --> 1:48:53.780]  see the people in the streets you know like you do in Europe but right now
[1:48:53.780 --> 1:48:58.420]  there are thousands of people around the country that are contacting their
[1:48:58.420 --> 1:49:02.100]  members of Congress and they are putting pressure on them and they are that's
[1:49:02.100 --> 1:49:06.820]  why you got the majority of Democrats for example to go against Obama and say
[1:49:06.820 --> 1:49:10.660]  they wanted a timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan this question the
[1:49:10.660 --> 1:49:14.740]  pressure sure shifting gears back into the dollar with the brick coming out
[1:49:14.740 --> 1:49:18.580]  saying they want to move away from the dollar with Soros moving you know
[1:49:18.580 --> 1:49:23.620]  calling for that and and trying to get a consensus together do you see it being a
[1:49:23.620 --> 1:49:28.620]  gradual process or then at some point do you see a fast drop in the value of the
[1:49:28.620 --> 1:49:33.660]  dollar and what's the time frame no it's a very gradual process and I mean
[1:49:33.660 --> 1:49:37.380]  obviously in currency markets there's enormous volatility you have things like
[1:49:37.380 --> 1:49:42.780]  the carry trade where right now for example you know traders are borrowing
[1:49:42.780 --> 1:49:45.780]  in dollars so they're selling the dollar that's what's pushed it down against the
[1:49:45.780 --> 1:49:48.700]  euro and then they're buying the euro because they're just because the
[1:49:48.700 --> 1:49:52.220]  European Central Bank is raising interest rates and we're not so you have
[1:49:52.220 --> 1:49:56.540]  those kinds of short-term things and you know and then that causes a lot of
[1:49:56.540 --> 1:50:03.380]  volatility but you know relative volatility but the you know the dollar
[1:50:03.380 --> 1:50:09.500]  crashing I you know I mean that would be actually good for us if it happened but
[1:50:09.500 --> 1:50:12.980]  I don't think it's going to happen because the big holders of dollar reserves
[1:50:12.980 --> 1:50:17.260]  like you know China and Japan they don't want that so it doesn't die with a bang
[1:50:17.260 --> 1:50:22.900]  it kind of just fades off into the sunset I think mostly yes especially now I
[1:50:22.900 --> 1:50:27.740]  mean you know a few years ago we had a trade deficit that was huge it was six
[1:50:27.740 --> 1:50:32.980]  percent of GDP we've lost a big chunk of that because of the recession alright
[1:50:32.980 --> 1:50:37.580]  listen Mark I want to get you back up in the near future CEPR.net interesting

[1:54:05.180 --> 1:54:09.460]  few hours ago she was set free
[1:54:09.780 --> 1:54:14.340]  flanked by her lawyers Mary Ann Godboldo walks out of the Wayne County
[1:54:14.340 --> 1:54:19.140]  Jail taking her first breaths of freedom since her 12-hour standoff with
[1:54:19.140 --> 1:54:24.100]  police last week I'm very excited to be out to be reunited
[1:54:24.100 --> 1:54:28.740]  reunited with my daughter I'm loving these wonderful ladies for working so
[1:54:28.740 --> 1:54:34.380]  tireless for me and Mr. Ron Scott as well all of the community I thank you so
[1:54:34.380 --> 1:54:38.580]  very much for coming out I really really appreciate it the 56-year-old
[1:54:38.580 --> 1:54:42.700]  mother ended up behind bars after police say she shot at them when they tried to
[1:54:42.700 --> 1:54:47.340]  take her daughter into custody Godboldo stayed silent when we asked her if she
[1:54:47.340 --> 1:54:59.660]  indeed opened fire on officers Godboldo's ordeal began last Thursday at
[1:54:59.660 --> 1:55:03.340]  her home here on Blaine when child protective services came to take
[1:55:03.340 --> 1:55:07.860]  custody of her 13-year-old daughter accusing Godboldo of not giving her
[1:55:07.860 --> 1:55:12.180]  medication for a mental condition Godboldo would not give up the child
[1:55:12.180 --> 1:55:16.820]  police were called broke down her door and that's when officers say Godboldo
[1:55:16.820 --> 1:55:21.580]  shot at them a standoff ensued she didn't open fire there was no shot
[1:55:21.580 --> 1:55:26.820]  fired well that is a legal issue that is not that's a lid so I'm sorry Allison
[1:55:26.820 --> 1:55:32.260]  that's an allegation Godboldo's bond was originally set at $500,000 last
[1:55:32.260 --> 1:55:37.940]  Sunday but a new judge today reduced it to a $200,000 personal bond Godboldo
[1:55:37.940 --> 1:55:43.260]  did not have to put up any cash and Godboldo's attorney also says that
[1:55:43.260 --> 1:55:46.740]  police did not have a warrant or any court documents when they came here to
[1:55:46.740 --> 1:55:50.100]  the home last week but we talked to police just a few minutes ago they say
[1:55:50.100 --> 1:55:54.260]  they had a writ which is a court order which allowed them to go into that home
[1:55:54.260 --> 1:55:59.660]  they say they even showed it to some of the family members of Godboldo but that
[1:55:59.660 --> 1:56:05.340]  warrant was did not exist according to the attorneys as for the custody of the
[1:56:05.340 --> 1:56:09.780]  young girl the 13-year-old there is a hearing early next month we'll keep you
[1:56:09.780 --> 1:56:21.060]  posted reporting live on Detroit's West Side I'm Tom Wade Channel 7 action we now
[1:56:21.060 --> 1:56:26.460]  have the backstory on this many of the reports in the newspapers are saying
[1:56:26.460 --> 1:56:31.260]  that there's no evidence she shot at them I've seen SWAT teams in Texas in being
[1:56:31.260 --> 1:56:36.700]  caught repeatedly in Austin also case in Midland where the cops shot their own
[1:56:36.700 --> 1:56:40.220]  cop in the back and then blame the guy I didn't have a gun I don't believe
[1:56:40.220 --> 1:56:42.740]  anything comes out of their mouths anymore because normally with
[1:56:42.740 --> 1:56:46.220]  government it's a lie maybe there's a chance she did but I don't believe she
[1:56:46.220 --> 1:56:50.780]  never even gotten out of jail that was the case but here's the issue because of
[1:56:50.780 --> 1:56:57.100]  a birth defect the state when she was born demanded they cut off her let her
[1:56:57.100 --> 1:57:01.900]  foot then she swam saying dance was happy was a home
[1:57:01.900 --> 1:57:05.660]  schooler then when she got into middle school she said I want to go to public
[1:57:05.660 --> 1:57:10.100]  school to meet people they demanded she be given vaccinations there's no law you
[1:57:10.100 --> 1:57:14.380]  have to but they lied and made her take vaccinations then she had an autoimmune
[1:57:14.380 --> 1:57:19.220]  response and through a fit and so then they demanded that she be put on Prozac
[1:57:19.220 --> 1:57:23.700]  type drugs she began acting out of character being irritated having facial
[1:57:23.700 --> 1:57:28.540]  grimaces and having associated with immunizations I told the Detroit news so
[1:57:28.540 --> 1:57:33.180]  then they said that she's got to go on the Prozac type drugs she said no so they
[1:57:33.180 --> 1:57:37.620]  came to take her to put her on the drugs and this is this is how it works folks
[1:57:37.620 --> 1:57:42.660]  in many areas the country now not just Illinois you can't pack a lunch they
[1:57:42.660 --> 1:57:46.780]  say we don't trust you know you can't feed your child they're trying to take
[1:57:46.780 --> 1:57:51.380]  people's children if they say they're overweight look folks this is the end of
[1:57:51.380 --> 1:57:56.020]  parenthood this is the end of parents that's what the TSA abusing children
[1:57:56.020 --> 1:58:01.500]  I've seen at the airports they pull them out and women out over and over again
[1:58:01.500 --> 1:58:06.500]  they're they're breaking the weakest or the people that can't resist will who
[1:58:06.500 --> 1:58:10.740]  are more compliant they're breaking their will first as Hitler said first you
[1:58:10.740 --> 1:58:14.460]  get the women then you got the children so follow the men you got the women
[1:58:14.460 --> 1:58:18.380]  that's why 80% or more of advertising targets women when women purchase most
[1:58:18.380 --> 1:58:22.260]  stuff at the grocery store they make most decisions on small ticket items and
[1:58:22.260 --> 1:58:27.340]  have just about as much decision on homes and cars women run the world the
[1:58:27.340 --> 1:58:33.300]  new owner runs women and they run men too men are busy you know watching sports
[1:58:33.300 --> 1:58:37.340]  and acting like five-year-olds okay we'll be right back with a ton of other

[1:58:53.780 --> 1:58:58.140]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[1:58:58.140 --> 1:59:02.300]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:59:02.300 --> 1:59:06.300]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:59:06.300 --> 1:59:10.180]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:59:10.180 --> 1:59:14.460]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:59:14.460 --> 1:59:18.620]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:59:18.620 --> 1:59:22.940]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:59:22.940 --> 1:59:26.660]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[2:00:19.940 --> 2:00:23.580]  Alex Jones
[2:00:24.500 --> 2:00:30.780]  SWAT attacks homeschool mom for refusing to force and the child forced
[2:00:30.780 --> 2:00:35.180]  vaccinations early on her even homeschooled middle school even the
[2:00:35.180 --> 2:00:38.620]  Detroit Free Press and others report an excellent record the community known as
[2:00:38.620 --> 2:00:43.660]  Upstanding no criminal record but her motherly natural instincts kicked in
[2:00:43.660 --> 2:00:48.860]  when the school demanded they put her on an unapproved psychotropic drug when
[2:00:48.860 --> 2:00:52.580]  she got a court order from Wayne County Circuit Court that it was an
[2:00:52.580 --> 2:00:56.500]  experimental drug and that the school could not force her to take it the CPS
[2:00:56.500 --> 2:01:02.140]  said we got men in black uniforms forget the courts launch attack and that's how
[2:01:02.140 --> 2:01:08.500]  it works and the standoff ended the 10 to 12 hour standoff ended there's
[2:01:08.500 --> 2:01:15.740]  different reports when a judge told her over the phone and as well well I
[2:01:15.740 --> 2:01:18.540]  should probably just read this article here instead of just picking through it
[2:01:18.540 --> 2:01:23.820]  here she sought help from the Children's Center an organization claiming to help
[2:01:23.820 --> 2:01:28.380]  families with at risk children of course they just called the CPS the school
[2:01:28.380 --> 2:01:34.460]  did and told relatives that medications ordered by the doctor were some symptoms
[2:01:34.460 --> 2:01:38.620]  including behavioral problems when she refused the mother refused to give her
[2:01:38.620 --> 2:01:42.340]  child the prescribed medication child protective services became involved CPS
[2:01:42.340 --> 2:01:48.180]  obtained a warrant to remove the child because the mother reportedly refused to
[2:01:48.180 --> 2:01:52.100]  surrender the child the state police claimed the mother discharged a firearm
[2:01:52.100 --> 2:01:56.500]  in her apartment during the standoff and that that's when SWAT team was called
[2:01:56.500 --> 2:02:02.140]  in her attorney Allison Fulmar that's what we got to get a hold of claims her
[2:02:02.140 --> 2:02:06.140]  client never shot at police notice the news didn't get that quote for you in a
[2:02:06.140 --> 2:02:09.980]  report in the voice of Detroit which reports that the police sent the
[2:02:09.980 --> 2:02:15.260]  Detroit special response team officers who descended on the home with a tank
[2:02:15.260 --> 2:02:20.500]  and assault weapons video footage shows individual officers stalking and staking
[2:02:20.500 --> 2:02:24.180]  out the house taking over behind trees with their weapons as in a military
[2:02:24.180 --> 2:02:29.220]  operation reports health impact daily news the Detroit news reports that the
[2:02:29.220 --> 2:02:32.660]  mother has an excellent reputation in her community and during a 10-hour
[2:02:32.660 --> 2:02:35.820]  standoff many people from the community offered to help with the negotiation
[2:02:35.820 --> 2:02:39.820]  including ministers and community activists Wayne circuit judge Deborah
[2:02:39.820 --> 2:02:44.100]  Thomas finally convinced the mother to surrender with a promise her daughter
[2:02:44.100 --> 2:02:47.620]  would be turned over to the relatives and of course the same judge had issued
[2:02:47.620 --> 2:02:50.580]  the order they couldn't drug her we don't care about judges we got we got
[2:02:50.580 --> 2:02:54.900]  uniforms and machine guns family members however say the girl was grabbed by the
[2:02:54.900 --> 2:02:57.940]  state regardless of the promise well the government promises you can bet it
[2:02:57.940 --> 2:03:03.060]  ain't gonna happen they just ignored the judge the mother a god boldo was a
[2:03:03.060 --> 2:03:08.980]  rain Sunday before the 36th district magistrate Sydney Barthwell junior on
[2:03:08.980 --> 2:03:13.020]  charges of firing a weapon and a dwelling so it's not that they even say
[2:03:13.020 --> 2:03:17.020]  that she shot at the cops she shot in the house and that's denied felonious
[2:03:17.020 --> 2:03:20.580]  assault resisting and obstructing an officer and useful firearm the
[2:03:20.580 --> 2:03:26.220]  commission of a felony her bond was set at 500,000 I remember the branch
[2:03:26.220 --> 2:03:30.300]  divisions were found not guilty of shooting at police and arson but then
[2:03:30.300 --> 2:03:34.580]  they were found guilty of using firearms the commission of a crime though no other
[2:03:34.580 --> 2:03:41.300]  crime was you know there was no other conviction for another crime and when
[2:03:41.300 --> 2:03:44.300]  the Supreme Court ruled that all of the dividends be released they weren't
[2:03:44.300 --> 2:03:49.460]  released for many years see this is how corrupt the system is just I see a
[2:03:49.460 --> 2:03:52.340]  little trick there they're doing I'm shocked by the amount of bond I never
[2:03:52.340 --> 2:03:56.140]  dreamed it would be set so high she wouldn't be free to care for her daughter
[2:03:56.140 --> 2:04:00.820]  said an outraged Deborah Thomas child protective services was trying to force
[2:04:00.820 --> 2:04:05.220]  her child to take a dangerous medication against her will we have been able to
[2:04:05.220 --> 2:04:09.060]  get a court order signed by Wayne County Circuit judge stating that the
[2:04:09.060 --> 2:04:14.100]  administration of the drug which is not approved by the FDA in such cases that's
[2:04:14.100 --> 2:04:18.500]  why they put her in Hawthorne so they could dope her up family attorney
[2:04:18.500 --> 2:04:23.820]  Allison fulmer told the media this case is yet another example of CPS working in
[2:04:23.820 --> 2:04:27.940]  league with the police in order to kidnap children she was obviously an
[2:04:27.940 --> 2:04:32.060]  excellent mother and not a threat to the police the fact that they sent a tank to
[2:04:32.060 --> 2:04:38.820]  her apartment to more is more evidence that the state will react in a violent
[2:04:38.820 --> 2:04:42.700]  knee jerk fashion when its authority is challenged yeah it's about breaking our
[2:04:42.700 --> 2:04:46.660]  will so there you go first they line shoot her up with vaccine suddenly
[2:04:46.660 --> 2:04:50.180]  starts having problems because of it that's even in the vaccine inserts it
[2:04:50.180 --> 2:04:53.540]  can cause that then they want to dope her up he doesn't want to dump her up here
[2:04:53.540 --> 2:04:56.700]  comes the SWAT team will teach you though they ride back your phone call

[2:08:40.100 --> 2:08:45.020]  up with what I was covering at the end of the hour this girl was born her foot
[2:08:45.020 --> 2:08:52.140]  was deformed they amputated it then she was home school till middle school great
[2:08:52.140 --> 2:08:57.540]  grades swimming dancing her mother well-known in the community even the
[2:08:57.540 --> 2:09:00.260]  Detroit Free Press is saying no criminal record upstanding member of the
[2:09:00.260 --> 2:09:04.740]  community she wanted to go to public school to have more friends put her in
[2:09:04.740 --> 2:09:09.380]  there then they said you got to have vaccinations obviously bullied the mom
[2:09:09.380 --> 2:09:15.380]  into that that's not the law but the news reported it like it was more fraud she
[2:09:15.380 --> 2:09:20.820]  suddenly starts to be angry have headaches that's one of the classic you
[2:09:20.820 --> 2:09:24.340]  know descriptions of side effects of course it's really the main effect is
[2:09:24.340 --> 2:09:28.220]  what they want to do and so they said well now we want to put her on
[2:09:28.220 --> 2:09:33.020]  experimental anti-psychotics and she even got a judge's order saying no CPS you
[2:09:33.020 --> 2:09:38.380]  can't CPS said we don't care sent police to take her to put her in some type of
[2:09:38.380 --> 2:09:43.540]  mental ward the police claims she shot a gun inside the house they come and
[2:09:43.540 --> 2:09:49.260]  grab her and here it is a mother cornered with her child not wanting to
[2:09:49.260 --> 2:09:53.500]  hand it over to the state they're like well it's the law no a judge had ordered
[2:09:53.500 --> 2:09:59.900]  them to not drug her but the CPS didn't care because this girl was disabled now
[2:09:59.900 --> 2:10:05.780]  mentally thanks to their shots and physically they can get on average four
[2:10:05.780 --> 2:10:10.340]  times more in federal and state aid through the different little government
[2:10:10.340 --> 2:10:14.340]  and private centers they put them in then they can for a child who doesn't have
[2:10:14.340 --> 2:10:22.820]  disabilities that's why 69% of Texas foster children WO AI radio and TV to
[2:10:22.820 --> 2:10:27.500]  report two years ago on it but it turns out that's the national average as well
[2:10:27.500 --> 2:10:34.740]  are given psychological designations and are put on drugs 60 plus percent because
[2:10:34.740 --> 2:10:40.620]  the money goes ding ding ding ding ding ding you know the big floodgates of
[2:10:40.620 --> 2:10:50.540]  money pop open once this gets rolling so that's why they were going after she
[2:10:50.540 --> 2:10:56.580]  was a plum goodie for them and it's just it's just that's why schools lie and
[2:10:56.580 --> 2:10:59.380]  say it's the law you got to take vaccines you're like well I know you've
[2:10:59.380 --> 2:11:02.140]  got a waiver form and that's a waiver form for something that isn't even the
[2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:06.180]  law you just ask for me to fill that out with the health department it's not a
[2:11:06.180 --> 2:11:10.660]  request it you absolutely have to comply they'll say okay here's the waiver form
[2:11:10.660 --> 2:11:14.420]  but they'll play dumb because the federal government if they don't get
[2:11:14.420 --> 2:11:18.460]  almost all the children vaccinated through the guidelines they don't get
[2:11:18.460 --> 2:11:21.620]  their federal money and the feds don't want you vaccinated because they care
[2:11:21.620 --> 2:11:24.940]  about you folks they've been caught worldwide the White House science ours
[2:11:24.940 --> 2:11:30.180]  written about it spiking the vaccines they've been caught over and over again
[2:11:30.180 --> 2:11:34.380]  remember this is a federal government for now close to 90 years forcibly
[2:11:34.380 --> 2:11:39.660]  sterilizing people in the U.S. up into the late 1980s they set up the family
[2:11:39.660 --> 2:11:44.140]  courts for sterilization they were called eugenics racial hygiene courts
[2:11:44.140 --> 2:11:47.860]  Hitler got all his ideas from the U.S. and England that's all mainline history
[2:11:47.860 --> 2:11:52.900]  we go researcher they're not real courts they have no force behind them but
[2:11:52.900 --> 2:11:58.980]  SWAT teams and that they color of law con you and so they operate through this
[2:11:58.980 --> 2:12:05.020]  fraud and they know exactly what they're doing and it's the health departments
[2:12:05.020 --> 2:12:07.740]  through the federal government even though they're quote county that tell
[2:12:07.740 --> 2:12:11.220]  the hospital oh it's a law you got to take blood from that baby for a blood
[2:12:11.220 --> 2:12:16.700]  test we want to do goes to a DNA data bank going on for 39 years almost 40 I
[2:12:16.700 --> 2:12:24.460]  mean the health departments are federal operations of criminality that doesn't
[2:12:24.460 --> 2:12:30.460]  mean all of the people at the health department food inspectors or you know
[2:12:30.460 --> 2:12:34.420]  somebody with animal control are but the original founding of health
[2:12:34.420 --> 2:12:38.460]  departments was for the family courts that do not have due process and they
[2:12:38.460 --> 2:12:42.620]  were protecting the children before that there were regular courts regular due
[2:12:42.620 --> 2:12:46.700]  process all right I'm gonna shut up and go to your calls and I got a bunch of
[2:12:46.700 --> 2:12:51.740]  financial news a bunch of news on Obama's tax speech that won't do anything to get
[2:12:51.740 --> 2:12:55.540]  rid of the deficit the Republicans slashing welfare I'll do nothing for it
[2:12:55.540 --> 2:12:59.980]  you got to get rid of the big mega banks or nothing will be fixed Leo in Texas
[2:12:59.980 --> 2:13:06.340]  you're on the year hi Alex I have a question for you and I have to do with
[2:13:06.340 --> 2:13:10.660]  the bricks that you're talking to mr. white blood before I'm a Brazilian
[2:13:10.660 --> 2:13:17.020]  national and my question is everyone wants to be like America all the
[2:13:17.020 --> 2:13:21.220]  countries want to reach this standard of living right everyone and if you go
[2:13:21.220 --> 2:13:27.660]  there I was I was born there is not even close so my question is you know
[2:13:27.660 --> 2:13:32.260]  based on the law supply and demand if wouldn't the prices of everything go
[2:13:32.260 --> 2:13:36.500]  high much higher and higher and higher and ever higher all the countries want
[2:13:36.500 --> 2:13:40.900]  want to be like America isn't that true Brazil wants to be just as rich and
[2:13:40.900 --> 2:13:46.900]  they're here and so does India so does China all these countries so let's be
[2:13:46.900 --> 2:13:51.180]  clear America became rich because it had the highest standard of liberty in
[2:13:51.180 --> 2:13:56.020]  property rights we're now become the greatest debtor nation in the world so
[2:13:56.020 --> 2:13:59.220]  if if nations think they want to be like us they want to be like the old
[2:13:59.220 --> 2:14:04.260]  America they don't want to be like this one that's right I agree with you but
[2:14:04.260 --> 2:14:07.380]  when you go out there and you talk to the people that's what they want to do
[2:14:07.380 --> 2:14:10.740]  they want to have all this infrastructure they want to buy you
[2:14:10.740 --> 2:14:15.420]  know Toyota Toyota Corolla's for cheap and and have their own that's not the
[2:14:15.420 --> 2:14:20.900]  case so my question is when it comes to supply and demand it wouldn't the prices
[2:14:20.900 --> 2:14:25.060]  of oil and metals and all that go high higher automatically because all these
[2:14:25.060 --> 2:14:30.460]  countries are also you know reaching from the same from the same supply well
[2:14:30.460 --> 2:14:34.380]  well well as as certain materials get more expensive they can just find
[2:14:34.380 --> 2:14:40.100]  alternate materials and generally through a long curve supply and demand if
[2:14:40.100 --> 2:14:44.660]  you really study history not so much the Keynesian version of it if you study it
[2:14:44.660 --> 2:14:50.260]  then it creates competition but yes if you don't have true free market true
[2:14:50.260 --> 2:14:56.020]  competition if you have oligopolies duopolis combines monopolies then
[2:14:56.020 --> 2:15:02.380]  prices do necessarily go up quality goes down but I don't think that actually
[2:15:02.380 --> 2:15:07.140]  Brazil doing better will make us do better the US doing better will make
[2:15:07.140 --> 2:15:12.540]  Germany do better China doing better will make us do better if it's a level
[2:15:12.540 --> 2:15:16.380]  playing field but it's not a level playing field when our government is
[2:15:16.380 --> 2:15:21.700]  run by globalists who own the factories on record in Brazil and China and so two
[2:15:21.700 --> 2:15:27.100]  years ago with the year and a half ago with a bailout of GM and others it was
[2:15:27.100 --> 2:15:32.300]  in the news a billion and a half to help start a GM plant in Brazil taxpayer
[2:15:32.300 --> 2:15:37.180]  money two billion to build one in China two billion or was it three billion for
[2:15:37.180 --> 2:15:42.700]  one in Eastern Europe controlled by Russia so again these globalists have
[2:15:42.700 --> 2:15:49.180]  invested in the emerging markets and then done inside deals to not just set up
[2:15:49.180 --> 2:15:53.620]  higher taxes and regulation here so we can't compete but also to get actual
[2:15:53.620 --> 2:15:59.580]  bailout money to themselves and then they take it to Brazil not because they
[2:15:59.580 --> 2:16:03.500]  care about the Brazilian people but so they can build them cheaper now you
[2:16:03.500 --> 2:16:06.460]  know if they they could already go down there and build them cheaper and then
[2:16:06.460 --> 2:16:10.460]  Brazil would be built up and we get a little bit better deal but instead it's
[2:16:10.460 --> 2:16:16.260]  super super cheaper and so then we can't compete and and so it's just
[2:16:16.260 --> 2:16:21.140]  incredible anything else I'm just I'm just really just sure it's on that
[2:16:21.140 --> 2:16:24.260]  issue that's good enough I could talk and yeah thanks for taking my call
[2:16:24.260 --> 2:16:28.700]  absolutely I appreciate your call it was true liberty I mean not perfect but the
[2:16:28.700 --> 2:16:34.580]  greatest expression ever that this country for its first hundred and sixty
[2:16:34.580 --> 2:16:41.420]  years or so hundred and fifty five years or so had zero inflation money stayed
[2:16:41.420 --> 2:16:49.860]  the same value zero inflation in the aggregate and on average a 10 and change
[2:16:49.860 --> 2:16:56.340]  I've got the exact number 10 plus growth rate a year like China's having now with
[2:16:56.340 --> 2:17:02.380]  their cookbooks they say at 3% growth rate on average I mean look the West is
[2:17:02.380 --> 2:17:07.660]  so dead and so socially reprobate and so decadent and we don't even have our
[2:17:07.660 --> 2:17:14.300]  instinct to breed the Japanese are the same the Europeans are the same anybody
[2:17:14.300 --> 2:17:18.780]  that because it's a paradox liberty and ingenuity and intelligence creates
[2:17:18.780 --> 2:17:22.420]  incredible wealth then your kids become spoiled brats their kids become little
[2:17:22.420 --> 2:17:28.300]  spoiled tyrants those kids become their kids become homeless and become enslaved
[2:17:28.300 --> 2:17:31.780]  I mean if you read the Bible even if you don't believe in God or whatever it's
[2:17:31.780 --> 2:17:35.780]  it's a history of what happened in the Middle East and the more and more they
[2:17:35.780 --> 2:17:38.980]  do archaeology the more they understand it it's one of the most accurate you know
[2:17:38.980 --> 2:17:43.340]  history books out there because you know they get other histories by the Romans
[2:17:43.340 --> 2:17:45.980]  and others and it mirrors exactly just from a different perspective what was
[2:17:45.980 --> 2:17:50.940]  being said and done and look at what happened to Israel every few hundred
[2:17:50.940 --> 2:17:55.060]  years they would get uppity get decadent would forget their roots and they'd get
[2:17:55.060 --> 2:17:59.820]  captured and enslaved and the prophets were always there saying we're gonna go
[2:17:59.820 --> 2:18:03.020]  over the edge of a cliff we're gonna be enslaved we become corrupt our kids are
[2:18:03.020 --> 2:18:07.780]  lazy we're dumb we've forgotten what made us strong boom enslaved and folks
[2:18:07.780 --> 2:18:12.660]  it's the same throughout history alright let's go to another call here that was
[2:18:12.660 --> 2:18:15.980]  an important question but I got to get to other people here Sean in Canada you're
[2:18:15.980 --> 2:18:22.500]  on the air hi Alex good talk to you welcome I've got a little request for
[2:18:22.500 --> 2:18:28.020]  if it's possible we have a girl that's a good patriot friend of ours in the
[2:18:28.020 --> 2:18:32.500]  networks online and she's doing a international strike have you heard of
[2:18:32.500 --> 2:18:36.180]  that this weekend I've heard a lot of people launching international strikes
[2:18:36.180 --> 2:18:40.260]  and and don't pay your taxes days and a lot of different organizations we've
[2:18:40.260 --> 2:18:44.500]  promoted yeah don't buy don't comply she's saying it's a united we strike
[2:18:44.500 --> 2:18:49.740]  calm it'd be a marathon radio show for two three days is that the lady I've
[2:18:49.740 --> 2:18:53.660]  had on I'm not sure if Karen's been on your show or not but I would recommend
[2:18:53.660 --> 2:18:59.660]  her awesome well I've had a lot of folks on and I think you know overall we need
[2:18:59.660 --> 2:19:06.220]  to reach out basically in an educational way and we're ever gonna have a big
[2:19:06.220 --> 2:19:10.820]  strike day we need to build towards it you know to really show the system the
[2:19:10.820 --> 2:19:15.000]  power of the people the problem is as long as the globalists control the
[2:19:15.000 --> 2:19:18.660]  issuance of currency and credit and that they get first use of the money and
[2:19:18.660 --> 2:19:23.780]  then can loan it out at interest that's manufacturing wealth for them out of
[2:19:23.780 --> 2:19:27.980]  nothing that's why the globalist can get away with such incredibly insane
[2:19:27.980 --> 2:19:35.400]  corrupt things is because they control the money machines all right David
[2:19:35.400 --> 2:19:38.460]  Martin Charles Josh others were getting to everybody I got a bunch of other

[2:24:15.500 --> 2:24:22.300]  David you're on the air welcome hey Alex thank you for taking my call welcome
[2:24:22.300 --> 2:24:26.460]  I've I've got a whole page of things I can talk about but I guess the whole
[2:24:26.460 --> 2:24:29.940]  CPS social services homeschooling thing is kind of at the top of my list and
[2:24:29.940 --> 2:24:36.460]  that's just it's driving me nuts I was actually homeschooled for 12 years back
[2:24:36.460 --> 2:24:41.860]  in the 80s I'm homeschooling my children but it's something that I think ever
[2:24:41.860 --> 2:24:45.260]  just every parent out there needs to consider you mentioned yesterday I think
[2:24:45.260 --> 2:24:48.740]  it was or maybe it was last Friday about how the cost of not being in public
[2:24:48.740 --> 2:24:52.540]  school can be a big barrier but listen everybody you just can't afford to let
[2:24:52.540 --> 2:24:55.660]  people do this to your children and and you got to figure out however you can do
[2:24:55.660 --> 2:24:59.180]  it even if it's not mom coming home to work there are ways to make it work so
[2:24:59.180 --> 2:25:02.480]  many of us you know dad you can help at night you don't have to do it in the
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:06.700]  morning you got to get your kids out of school we had a real quick I want to
[2:25:06.700 --> 2:25:11.380]  share something that happened us we have a situation where my oldest daughter is
[2:25:11.380 --> 2:25:15.740]  actually my wife's first daughter she's my stepdaughter and so CPS actually came
[2:25:15.740 --> 2:25:20.580]  at the father's allegations for some false things years ago and interestingly
[2:25:20.580 --> 2:25:24.260]  their tactics have always been gorilla this was in Virginia so but I think they
[2:25:24.260 --> 2:25:27.900]  trained in this way everywhere when the lady came to our house she came to the
[2:25:27.900 --> 2:25:32.020]  driveway we're watching out the window she parked in our driveway in the normal
[2:25:32.020 --> 2:25:34.660]  area where everyone would park I mean the way this driver was set up it was
[2:25:34.660 --> 2:25:38.260]  obvious where you're supposed to park she sat there for a couple seconds in her
[2:25:38.260 --> 2:25:43.100]  car and then she adjusted her car reparked it sideways behind our vehicle as
[2:25:43.100 --> 2:25:46.820]  close as she could get to our car so that there was no possible way we could
[2:25:46.820 --> 2:25:50.540]  get out of the driveway and it was just just remarkable her whole mentality of
[2:25:50.540 --> 2:25:56.260]  well that's like a lot of the census workers will bust in houses come at 10
[2:25:56.260 --> 2:26:00.460]  11 at night they've had cases where they call SWAT teams if you don't talk to
[2:26:00.460 --> 2:26:03.900]  them they end up killing people there's been a few cases of that last year I
[2:26:03.900 --> 2:26:08.300]  mean because they're giving people that don't have any training in the law the
[2:26:08.300 --> 2:26:13.420]  Bill of Rights police procedure quasi police powers it's the same thing with
[2:26:13.420 --> 2:26:17.980]  CPS and a lot of cops go overboard with the power they've got and they've been
[2:26:17.980 --> 2:26:22.540]  trained a lot more and are sworn officers that these people aren't and
[2:26:22.540 --> 2:26:27.300]  it's and the CPS just operate I have covered CPS cases where they don't even
[2:26:27.300 --> 2:26:31.780]  fill out the child's name right their age right they'll just use old forms from
[2:26:31.780 --> 2:26:36.820]  other cases to file with the courts because they just operate under a
[2:26:36.820 --> 2:26:41.180]  predatory federal funding system where they have quotas to get more and more
[2:26:41.180 --> 2:26:45.900]  children that's right and they their their whole system is designed to try to
[2:26:45.900 --> 2:26:50.180]  trap you then they even told us we were interviewed by someone a psychological
[2:26:50.180 --> 2:26:54.900]  evaluator to you know evaluate our our fitness as parents and we went in naively
[2:26:54.900 --> 2:26:58.540]  trying to just be so bright and chipper and cheerful the lady was so bright she
[2:26:58.540 --> 2:27:02.900]  was just kind and loving I mean just she was just as sweet as Christmas
[2:27:02.900 --> 2:27:07.500]  pudding and she writes the report a month later and completely stabbed us in
[2:27:07.500 --> 2:27:10.620]  the back twisted everything out of proportion her only statement that she
[2:27:10.620 --> 2:27:14.180]  can make as well this little girl appears to be well adjusted and she appears
[2:27:14.180 --> 2:27:18.380]  to be normal but surrounded by that were pages and pages and pages against our
[2:27:18.380 --> 2:27:22.860]  Christianity how we teach absolutes and what's wrong with us and you know all
[2:27:22.860 --> 2:27:26.380]  of the country they take people's children because they're Christian and
[2:27:26.380 --> 2:27:31.460]  they say that it's a cult as Janet Reno said on 60 minutes over a decade ago
[2:27:31.460 --> 2:27:34.740]  she said if you believe in the second coming of Christ you are a cult member
[2:27:34.740 --> 2:27:38.860]  and that's the bottom line and that's what's why even for homeschooling it's
[2:27:38.860 --> 2:27:42.200]  not about academics or whether you're socialized well everybody knows home
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:46.380]  schoolers do incredibly well I mean I had had never had a problem getting a
[2:27:46.380 --> 2:27:50.660]  job now I remember business and it's not about socialization it's about we teach
[2:27:50.660 --> 2:27:55.140]  absolutes we teach right the high schools especially in Dallas then I
[2:27:55.140 --> 2:27:59.060]  moved here for the last couple years high school was way more wild than college
[2:27:59.060 --> 2:28:03.500]  I mean it was it was drugs everywhere and I wasn't into drugs but they were
[2:28:03.500 --> 2:28:08.780]  just everywhere it was sex everywhere it was materialism I mean I would never
[2:28:08.780 --> 2:28:13.660]  put my children in public school after what I witnessed and they're just
[2:28:13.660 --> 2:28:17.700]  horrible they're absolutely bottom of the barrel horrible and I went to a
[2:28:17.700 --> 2:28:22.660]  middle-class high school I mean I can't imagine I mean I taught people that
[2:28:22.660 --> 2:28:26.620]  gone to this high school in New York in places being robbed being beat up you
[2:28:26.620 --> 2:28:31.340]  know you hear the stories people like Howard Stern tells of being beat up
[2:28:31.340 --> 2:28:34.940]  every week at school and people taking his lunch money I mean that's what goes
[2:28:34.940 --> 2:28:38.300]  on and then if you're not a wimp you end up fighting back and then you go to
[2:28:38.300 --> 2:28:42.100]  jail for it I mean I remember many times somebody would attack me in the
[2:28:42.100 --> 2:28:46.420]  parking lot or in an event and I'd fight back and the cops pull up and the other
[2:28:46.420 --> 2:28:50.660]  guys you know knocked down on the ground with blood coming out their nose and the
[2:28:50.660 --> 2:28:53.860]  cops go well you're going to jail and then you have to get witnesses and go
[2:28:53.860 --> 2:29:00.100]  to the court process I mean it's horrible it's horrible and you know I you
[2:29:00.100 --> 2:29:03.940]  know like I said I was 11 12 13 getting beat up all the time when I started
[2:29:03.940 --> 2:29:08.380]  fighting back which is only thing you can do then then you go to jail for it I
[2:29:08.380 --> 2:29:12.060]  never got convicted anything because my dad had some money you can get lawyers
[2:29:12.060 --> 2:29:15.500]  but you know cops long times wouldn't care they'd say yeah this guy attacked
[2:29:15.500 --> 2:29:18.340]  Alex you know there's five witnesses they're like we don't care you're going
[2:29:18.340 --> 2:29:26.740]  to jail now one time some 25-year-old ex-con who the police knew and didn't
[2:29:26.740 --> 2:29:31.020]  like started a fight at a house party with me and I mean I was fighting for
[2:29:31.020 --> 2:29:35.140]  my life I beat him bad because he'd be beating me up bad I mean I heard him
[2:29:35.140 --> 2:29:38.900]  fierce and when they were loading him in the ambulance they said we can need to
[2:29:38.900 --> 2:29:41.860]  take you to the hospital to have taken to jail I'm like well I'm beat up a
[2:29:41.860 --> 2:29:45.060]  little bit they said you got to go okay or you're gonna go jail you understand
[2:29:45.060 --> 2:29:48.940]  so they at least in that one case the cops acted properly because the witnesses
[2:29:48.940 --> 2:29:55.780]  told them what happened we're on the March the empires on the run Alex Jones
[2:29:55.780 --> 2:30:04.580]  and the GCN radio network when you're out on the road the last place you want

[2:31:23.100 --> 2:31:27.860]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:31:27.860 --> 2:31:31.660]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[2:33:37.020 --> 2:33:41.020]  Federal Reserve the dollar devaluation and the thousand plus trillion that
[2:33:41.020 --> 2:33:45.140]  they've gotten our nation to sign on to Martin Charles Josh Chris your calls
[2:33:45.140 --> 2:33:52.060]  are coming up but I wanted to hit some financial news gold gains 1.2 closes in
[2:33:52.060 --> 2:34:00.820]  on record high gold raises 1% as silver surges on weak dollar that's Reuters
[2:34:00.820 --> 2:34:06.860]  strong dollar downbeat data keep gold steady Wall Street Journal gold silver
[2:34:06.860 --> 2:34:13.700]  prices pop as stocks sag those are just some of the headlines today here's
[2:34:13.700 --> 2:34:20.300]  market watch gold up 1.2% closing in on record high here's another one of
[2:34:20.300 --> 2:34:26.300]  Reuters gold raises over 1% and silver surged on Thursday as a combination of
[2:34:26.300 --> 2:34:30.580]  dollar weakness inflation worries and renewable Greek sovereign debt worries
[2:34:30.580 --> 2:34:36.980]  lifted billion to below five dollars in its record high and by the way Tim Tim
[2:34:36.980 --> 2:34:40.020]  was in here with my red book I finally got a new copy of it we asked him to
[2:34:40.020 --> 2:34:42.540]  bring me the red book because it was in here yesterday and I wanted to cover it
[2:34:42.540 --> 2:34:46.180]  today and it's been taken a coin book because I'm trying to really learn more
[2:34:46.180 --> 2:34:51.380]  about this myself as I get so many questions from listeners but I wanted
[2:34:51.380 --> 2:34:55.100]  to bring Ted Anderson up here to talk about what's happening in the market
[2:34:55.100 --> 2:35:00.420]  we've got the brick group China India Russia Brazil and others saying in the
[2:35:00.420 --> 2:35:05.620]  dollar hegemony we've got over the weekend at Bretton Woods to in New
[2:35:05.620 --> 2:35:10.700]  Hampshire we've got Soros saying the dollar is already being phased down and
[2:35:10.700 --> 2:35:14.580]  it's no longer the World Reserve currency I had a big McClatchy slash
[2:35:14.580 --> 2:35:18.940]  London Guardian reporter and PhD economist on he was thinking this is a
[2:35:18.940 --> 2:35:22.860]  good idea thinking it'll bring back more manufacturing as the dollar lowers but
[2:35:22.860 --> 2:35:26.540]  these countries are already so far below us with their currency value I don't see
[2:35:26.540 --> 2:35:30.340]  that happening and many economists agree with me on that front I wanted to get
[2:35:30.340 --> 2:35:34.100]  your take on that but I wanted to get today's offer out of the way because I
[2:35:34.100 --> 2:35:37.580]  didn't have a chance to talk to you a lot before you came on there in the break
[2:35:37.580 --> 2:35:41.340]  I just knew I wanted to get you back on today you've been running some radio
[2:35:41.340 --> 2:35:51.500]  specials on gold Franks out of Europe on British sovereigns out of obviously
[2:35:51.500 --> 2:35:56.820]  England you've been running a lot of these just don't worry about the book
[2:35:56.820 --> 2:36:01.020]  it's fine just just forget it all right just just just don't worry about it if
[2:36:01.020 --> 2:36:06.660]  he's gone or whatever and going over all of this there's so many different coins
[2:36:06.660 --> 2:36:13.380]  there's numismatic versus bullion versus all of this all I know is that when I
[2:36:13.380 --> 2:36:17.860]  try to go out and buy a modern silver dollar or an old silver dollar US silver
[2:36:17.860 --> 2:36:24.180]  dollar they're always now between 40 and 45 dollars a piece and I get a lot of
[2:36:24.180 --> 2:36:28.900]  emails and calls on air asking me the differences asking me what a Frank is if
[2:36:28.900 --> 2:36:34.500]  it's French or if it's Swiss what's a British sovereign what's a good deal on
[2:36:34.500 --> 2:36:37.860]  these and I know people can always buy a copy of the red book it's like a Kelly
[2:36:37.860 --> 2:36:43.220]  blue book for cars but that only comes out once a year and with golden silver
[2:36:43.220 --> 2:36:48.540]  racing up you can't tell but but and soon I want to get you up for a full hour
[2:36:48.540 --> 2:36:53.140]  to really go over this when I have my red book with me I want to get you on to
[2:36:53.140 --> 2:36:58.860]  really break all this down but explain to me numismatic versus not numismatic
[2:36:58.860 --> 2:37:06.700]  bullion explain to me say a silver dollar from 1918 put out by the US Mint
[2:37:06.700 --> 2:37:11.140]  versus what a silver dollar is today and then I want to go over some of these
[2:37:11.140 --> 2:37:14.300]  specials because because I think a lot of people can't even believe how good the
[2:37:14.300 --> 2:37:18.740]  deal was when you were offering a silver dollar for $31 with shipping with a
[2:37:18.740 --> 2:37:23.120]  $20 creature from Jekyll Island book I think people couldn't even understand
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:29.780]  three silver dollars with three of my best-selling DVDs and free shipping for
[2:37:29.780 --> 2:37:34.820]  110 and I believe that is going up now but so so I mean because those silver
[2:37:34.820 --> 2:37:38.460]  dollars on record are selling for 40 something you're selling them for 31
[2:37:38.460 --> 2:37:43.140]  with free films and all the rest of it so so break down some of the basics if
[2:37:43.140 --> 2:37:46.460]  you had three minutes talking to the Rotary Club to explain the basic facts
[2:37:46.460 --> 2:37:50.100]  of gold and silver coins that are just going up and up and up what would you
[2:37:50.100 --> 2:37:53.980]  say to them well I mean for starters you have a lot of good questions because
[2:37:53.980 --> 2:37:57.780]  you're talking about numismatic bullion what is the difference you know why an
[2:37:57.780 --> 2:38:03.380]  older coin versus a newer coin this type of thing you know back when the back
[2:38:03.380 --> 2:38:11.180]  when the original currency bill came out with the the coinage act of 1792 at that
[2:38:11.180 --> 2:38:15.540]  time the continental currency was falling apart and what the United States
[2:38:15.540 --> 2:38:20.700]  adopted for money was the silver dollar and the silver dollar was something that
[2:38:20.700 --> 2:38:24.500]  came from Spain not from Britain and it certainly had nothing to do with the
[2:38:24.500 --> 2:38:30.180]  tryouts that we're looking at now it has 0.78 ounces of Troy ounces of silver in
[2:38:30.180 --> 2:38:36.260]  it and it's 90% silver and it's 10 and 10% copper and the coppers there to
[2:38:36.260 --> 2:38:40.740]  harden the coin so you can carry it in your pocket so it wouldn't wear out so
[2:38:40.740 --> 2:38:44.540]  you actually have some value in copper and you have some value in silver so the
[2:38:44.540 --> 2:38:48.700]  silver dollar circulation coin it's got some other metal in it so it's not soft
[2:38:48.700 --> 2:38:54.620]  exactly because if you carried a 999 fine silver coin in your pocket and used
[2:38:54.620 --> 2:38:59.260]  it as coinage it would be worn flat so fast as it was the copper coins did that
[2:38:59.260 --> 2:39:04.020]  to the coins with copper in them but they lasted a lot longer so what are
[2:39:04.020 --> 2:39:07.700]  those silver coins and and and what are their issuance period some of the ones
[2:39:07.700 --> 2:39:13.420]  I get from you are 1890s 1920s explained to me what those are and what their
[2:39:13.420 --> 2:39:16.780]  current market value is what they're selling for somebody looks up that
[2:39:16.780 --> 2:39:20.740]  coin well they're going to be trading just a little bit above $40 a piece or
[2:39:20.740 --> 2:39:25.740]  about 40 to 41 and that would be an older Morgan silver dollar a piece dollar
[2:39:25.740 --> 2:39:30.980]  and the neat part about that is is that it doesn't have all the the attachments
[2:39:30.980 --> 2:39:36.620]  to it like the 6045 ruling revenue ruling requires that silver bars you
[2:39:36.620 --> 2:39:40.660]  have to get social security numbers when you sell them this type of thing so it
[2:39:40.660 --> 2:39:44.740]  does have this sort of numismatic or aura to it but the neat part about it is
[2:39:44.740 --> 2:39:48.420]  like you explained it last time you were on there without me is that some of
[2:39:48.420 --> 2:39:53.540]  these coins in the modern age the US silver eagle for example the premiums
[2:39:53.540 --> 2:39:58.100]  have shot up so much that you actually get more silver for the dollar if you
[2:39:58.100 --> 2:40:03.380]  buy the old pre 1964 coins like the dimes quarters and 50 cent pieces and
[2:40:03.380 --> 2:40:07.220]  that's because of the fact that for some reason the public is ignoring those
[2:40:07.220 --> 2:40:11.340]  even though there's a finite supply and the US mint can't keep up with the US
[2:40:11.340 --> 2:40:16.860]  silver eagles so the premium overspot is just simply in the wholesale market you
[2:40:16.860 --> 2:40:21.460]  can't get them so you're saying is on average you pay more for the modern
[2:40:21.460 --> 2:40:25.100]  999 and that's why I get confused between all these I've got them both then
[2:40:25.100 --> 2:40:30.780]  for these old semi numismatic silver coins that is exactly when I look on
[2:40:30.780 --> 2:40:36.300]  eBay the old silver dollars are like 44 or 45 dollars you're saying a good deal
[2:40:36.300 --> 2:40:40.740]  on one is 41 yeah that's exactly right because I buy them in bulk and a lot of
[2:40:40.740 --> 2:40:44.220]  people are by the time you buy something on eBay and you get shipping and you're
[2:40:44.220 --> 2:40:49.060]  dealing with onesie-toosie type items you just can't get the discounts you can
[2:40:49.060 --> 2:40:52.800]  like I am I mean I the last order I placed for silver in the marketplace was
[2:40:52.800 --> 2:40:57.140]  well over a million dollars and you know so I'm dealing with these wholesalers
[2:40:57.140 --> 2:41:01.060]  and I'm like you know after chisel them down and you know it's like a fight all
[2:41:01.060 --> 2:41:05.340]  the time you know and nobody wants to be short and or naked in the marketplace
[2:41:05.340 --> 2:41:08.940]  right now because the market's running up I mean take a look at what silver and
[2:41:08.940 --> 2:41:13.440]  gold are doing even today silver and gold have hit a peak that has never been
[2:41:13.440 --> 2:41:20.780]  seen before silver hit a high today of 4180 gold hit a high of 1475 40 and I
[2:41:20.780 --> 2:41:24.260]  can understand why people get confused and mixed up because there's a lot of
[2:41:24.260 --> 2:41:28.900]  silver rounds in the marketplace right now that are made by private mints that
[2:41:28.900 --> 2:41:33.580]  make duplicates of the old Morgan dollar and the peace dollar and they stamp
[2:41:33.580 --> 2:41:37.660]  999 fine on there and one ounce in addition to this there's a lot of
[2:41:37.660 --> 2:41:41.820]  people like to call the silver eagle a silver dollar which it just is not yeah
[2:41:41.820 --> 2:41:45.260]  that's what I tend to do and I'm trying to learn all this I mean I've been
[2:41:45.260 --> 2:41:50.380]  studying it for years but it's so complex like I have the redbook here the one I
[2:41:50.380 --> 2:41:53.820]  was able to find is this year I mean here's an example some of the silver
[2:41:53.820 --> 2:41:58.340]  coins I bought over the years look just like these but I didn't even look up the
[2:41:58.340 --> 2:42:02.620]  value of them when I got them because I was getting them at near spot but I'm
[2:42:02.620 --> 2:42:06.420]  looking at silver dollars issued here you know that it's saying it's worth
[2:42:06.420 --> 2:42:14.620]  $1,700 $4,100 you know flip the page they've got 1843 ones you know the EF
[2:42:14.620 --> 2:42:25.180]  40s $375 I'm looking at a variety to reduce diameter 1838 motto removed you
[2:42:25.180 --> 2:42:32.140]  know $4,000 MS 63 I mean I can't even and some of the silver dollars I get from
[2:42:32.140 --> 2:42:35.820]  you even look like these but you're saying they're worth $41 and you were
[2:42:35.820 --> 2:42:39.340]  selling them at $31 because you bought them when silver was a lot lower because
[2:42:39.340 --> 2:42:46.300]  it's run up so fast I'm looking at 1940 silver quarters that it says they're
[2:42:46.300 --> 2:42:51.060]  worth $425 and this is the kind of stuff you can find still in circulation
[2:42:51.060 --> 2:42:55.100]  people just don't know kind of those coin hounds so this is a whole area people
[2:42:55.100 --> 2:42:58.300]  need to get a redbook and get knowledgeable because quite frankly I've
[2:42:58.300 --> 2:43:02.100]  read the redbook over and over again it still just turns into a giant maze you
[2:43:02.100 --> 2:43:05.420]  got to just know how to look these up that's why bullion is such a good thing
[2:43:05.420 --> 2:43:09.180]  to buy whether it's modern or whether it's old that's why it's good to get
[2:43:09.180 --> 2:43:12.460]  these semi-numismatic and meaning they have some collector value but they're
[2:43:12.460 --> 2:43:18.420]  right at spot price are lower because you know that you're getting a good deal
[2:43:18.420 --> 2:43:22.740]  but I mean Ted explained to me the incredible values of just pennies and
[2:43:22.740 --> 2:43:26.820]  quarters and things in here as well I mean let's just put it this way if we
[2:43:26.820 --> 2:43:30.340]  take a look at the dimes which is a great example because you can just take a
[2:43:30.340 --> 2:43:36.500]  dime today and compare it to what a dime is back in pre-1964 which some people
[2:43:36.500 --> 2:43:44.580]  will call numismatic a pre-1964 dime right now is is that for a thousand of
[2:43:44.580 --> 2:43:49.540]  it's three thousand and thirty two dollars or for to break it down you're
[2:43:49.540 --> 2:43:55.100]  gonna pay three dollars per dime you know so what what's happening is the
[2:43:55.100 --> 2:43:59.820]  value of a dime is just losing purchasing power the copper dime against the silver
[2:43:59.820 --> 2:44:02.580]  but in here there are some dimes that are worth thousands what are those
[2:44:02.580 --> 2:44:06.380]  limited editions yeah exactly there's you're talking about is it a rare date
[2:44:06.380 --> 2:44:11.580]  is it a rare mint mark has the coin been worn or used at all another question I
[2:44:11.580 --> 2:44:14.980]  bought silver dollars from you because I'll just find out what's a good deal
[2:44:14.980 --> 2:44:18.180]  here every few months and buy a few of these a few of those I've got silver
[2:44:18.180 --> 2:44:23.900]  dollars that I bought it well at whatever spot was at the time from you that
[2:44:23.900 --> 2:44:27.900]  and I'll show folks a document cam shot that that have an eagle and a face and
[2:44:27.900 --> 2:44:34.620]  years just like this one I'm looking at and it's called this one is called a
[2:44:34.620 --> 2:44:43.180]  1878 double tail feathers 3,575 so let's say five six years ago I bought
[2:44:43.180 --> 2:44:48.460]  one of these from you for $12 a piece and it looks just like it and it's the
[2:44:48.460 --> 2:44:53.060]  similar years but I paid $12 or whatever spot was at the time how can one of
[2:44:53.060 --> 2:44:58.340]  these coins be 3,575 is that they put out a limited edition of double tail
[2:44:58.340 --> 2:45:01.620]  feathers just the tail feathers are different so it has a collector value
[2:45:01.620 --> 2:45:05.540]  right exactly it's a different type of the dime was designed differently than
[2:45:05.540 --> 2:45:09.580]  the normal Morgan silver dollar at that time so if you happen to get into that
[2:45:09.580 --> 2:45:14.620]  particular vintage and you have a coin that is of the quality then you can get
[2:45:14.620 --> 2:45:19.500]  a you know quite a premium form they specific if people want numismatic and
[2:45:19.500 --> 2:45:22.780]  extremely numismatic coins you do have some of those you just mainly are
[2:45:22.780 --> 2:45:26.380]  promoting bullion correct that's right because I think the economy is falling
[2:45:26.380 --> 2:45:30.140]  apart I think it's more important that people get more gold and silver in their
[2:45:30.140 --> 2:45:33.820]  hand and not rare collector pieces that carry a big premium but Ted I've talked
[2:45:33.820 --> 2:45:38.740]  to really wealthy people who tell me Alex the real way people who are really
[2:45:38.740 --> 2:45:43.740]  wealthy save things as they get real art that people don't know how valuable it
[2:45:43.740 --> 2:45:47.660]  is small paintings or they get collector coins that they know they got a good
[2:45:47.660 --> 2:45:53.420]  deal on because there are you know gold coins silver coins one guy explained it
[2:45:53.420 --> 2:45:56.740]  to me and pulled it up online there are some pennies that are worth a million
[2:45:56.740 --> 2:46:00.660]  dollars apiece that you could sell in any country and you could go right through
[2:46:00.660 --> 2:46:03.660]  an airport and they wouldn't know you had ten million dollars in your pocket
[2:46:03.660 --> 2:46:09.020]  with ten ten pennies yep that's right that's right exactly right and and and
[2:46:09.020 --> 2:46:13.500]  to have old rarities like that there is a there's a value there there's grading
[2:46:13.500 --> 2:46:17.940]  surfaces there's a market for them it's liquid there it's a it's a good way to
[2:46:17.940 --> 2:46:22.940]  go for the average guy that's looking at surviving this crisis that we have
[2:46:22.940 --> 2:46:26.780]  coming on I would suggest that you stick closer to melt value if you have a lot
[2:46:26.780 --> 2:46:30.140]  of extra money and you want to try buying some of these collector coins
[2:46:30.140 --> 2:46:34.820]  absolutely we carry them but I would suggest if you're gonna get started I
[2:46:34.820 --> 2:46:38.980]  would set up what's I call a core position and a great way to get into that
[2:46:38.980 --> 2:46:43.700]  core position is to buy these old survival bags and when I said three dimes to
[2:46:43.700 --> 2:46:47.820]  one it's not it's 30 dimes to one that's how much the value of the currency has
[2:46:47.820 --> 2:46:52.100]  gone down and you know so you can get these older dimes and you actually get
[2:46:52.100 --> 2:46:58.500]  to buy the older dimes price per ounce on its silver content for less than what
[2:46:58.500 --> 2:47:02.740]  you would pay for a current US silver eagle because the market has gone so
[2:47:02.740 --> 2:47:06.940]  high on those in addition to this the supply is it's dried up it's not even
[2:47:06.940 --> 2:47:11.020]  hardly available it's surprising to me that I could even buy old junk bags I
[2:47:11.020 --> 2:47:15.300]  mean the Pittman act back in 1980 they melt and most everything off the silver
[2:47:15.300 --> 2:47:19.900]  dollars and everything so that the dimes that you know slipped through or got
[2:47:19.900 --> 2:47:23.260]  kept in the attic that then gets sold into the market now Tim we're almost out
[2:47:23.260 --> 2:47:32.020]  of time here but but but explain to me okay what is a say 1932 because I know
[2:47:32.020 --> 2:47:36.900]  I've got a little little you know a group of those in the 1930s British sovereign
[2:47:36.900 --> 2:47:41.460]  now I bought those from you at spot prices but then I went and looked them
[2:47:41.460 --> 2:47:46.740]  up and they the very coins I have have higher prices listed because they do have
[2:47:46.740 --> 2:47:50.540]  a numismatic value but then you're able I guess to get them at billion prices so
[2:47:50.540 --> 2:47:54.940]  you sell them at billion prices but what is say a you know in good condition
[2:47:54.940 --> 2:47:58.900]  1933 I know it's at the top of your head British sovereign you know with the
[2:47:58.900 --> 2:48:03.500]  Queen of England on it right now as a king on it currently right now 399 it's
[2:48:03.500 --> 2:48:07.700]  just under 400 of course I have that on a special right now actually the prices
[2:48:07.700 --> 2:48:12.620]  over 400 on my website that's because the markets got up I've held the prices
[2:48:12.620 --> 2:48:15.660]  back just like I usually do is that a fifth of an ounce how much is in one of
[2:48:15.660 --> 2:48:20.580]  those it's it's just under a fifth of an ounce and off the top of my head let's
[2:48:20.580 --> 2:48:23.900]  see if I could just pull it up here real quick I'll tell you what exactly that the
[2:48:23.900 --> 2:48:26.860]  weight well the point is they can call the brokers and find all this out that's
[2:48:26.860 --> 2:48:29.700]  why they need to call them to get the specifics now let's get back to the big
[2:48:29.700 --> 2:48:33.460]  big special everybody loves I haven't asked you in the one minute I had before
[2:48:33.460 --> 2:48:37.900]  you went live what is the price now of the three silver dollars that's the
[2:48:37.900 --> 2:48:41.380]  right name for them yeah there's over dollars they're real silver dollars I
[2:48:41.380 --> 2:48:44.740]  mean these are the constitutional silver dollars that we used to be able
[2:48:44.740 --> 2:48:49.260]  to exchange our silver certificates for okay so you've got the silver dollars
[2:48:49.260 --> 2:48:52.020]  that you're saying in the market normally sell right now about 41 dollars I
[2:48:52.020 --> 2:48:55.060]  looked it up there actually more than that but you're lowballing it you've got
[2:48:55.060 --> 2:48:58.900]  three of these three of my films and free shipping how much is it it's a
[2:48:58.900 --> 2:49:02.620]  hundred and fifteen dollars delivered right now I raised it five bucks because
[2:49:02.620 --> 2:49:09.020]  I had to okay in the market three of these 40 40 40 that would be that would
[2:49:09.020 --> 2:49:12.780]  be a hundred and twenty dollars so there's a discount there then the free
[2:49:12.780 --> 2:49:17.220]  shipping then the three films $60 value that is an extremely good deal on those
[2:49:17.220 --> 2:49:21.580]  it is absolutely I mean right now there's no way I could sell you one for the
[2:49:21.580 --> 2:49:26.660]  price of one of these that's $38 for one and it and now you're getting the
[2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:32.220]  videos along with it plus also also it covers the postage to you Alex I lose
[2:49:32.220 --> 2:49:37.260]  money on these deals I mean I but I I'm just you know I don't want to stop people
[2:49:37.260 --> 2:49:40.940]  from getting your films you know there's just so many people that are taking
[2:49:40.940 --> 2:49:45.020]  advantage of this in addition to this now everybody that ordered even a week
[2:49:45.020 --> 2:49:50.340]  ago is looking at silver go knowing that they had just they just secured away
[2:49:50.340 --> 2:49:54.460]  you know silver and it's a pirate price now in it I don't think that's going to
[2:49:54.460 --> 2:50:01.020]  end I mean that we we are seeing the the consequences of of Washington DC running
[2:50:01.020 --> 2:50:05.100]  a printing press like nobody's business and the Federal Reserve meddling with
[2:50:05.100 --> 2:50:09.740]  the economy bailing out everybody in the entire world us entering into a new

[2:54:10.660 --> 2:54:13.100]  network
[2:54:14.940 --> 2:54:20.420]  let's rampage through some quick calls here. Artany in Florida you're on the
[2:54:20.420 --> 2:54:26.860]  year welcome. Hey Alex how you doing today sir? Good welcome. Thank you thank
[2:54:26.860 --> 2:54:29.980]  you for being so diligent throughout the year. First I got a few points to
[2:54:29.980 --> 2:54:32.940]  bring up a couple quick questions I'll try to make it fast. First thing is
[2:54:32.940 --> 2:54:35.900]  besides the AstroCame I don't know if you know about the acylfamine and the
[2:54:35.900 --> 2:54:38.940]  phenolainaline that's been a lot of the food products especially the gums and the
[2:54:38.940 --> 2:54:44.420]  diadrine. Yes very bad for you. I've got CBS News and CNN admitting that they're
[2:54:44.420 --> 2:54:49.780]  allowed to put silicone in many products including chicken McNuggets. Yes
[2:54:49.780 --> 2:54:52.860]  definitely I did and that's what helped me with getting my kids completely
[2:54:52.860 --> 2:54:57.060]  organic. Some of the health problems that those other products cause. Another
[2:54:57.060 --> 2:55:00.220]  thing I won't mention the other radio show but somebody brought up the fact
[2:55:00.220 --> 2:55:05.220]  about harp over when all the birds over Arkansas fell out of the sky and they
[2:55:05.220 --> 2:55:09.980]  got proof that with the ripple in the sky and the clouds I'm an avid fisherman
[2:55:09.980 --> 2:55:13.780]  down here in South Florida and we have something that's called mackerel skies
[2:55:13.780 --> 2:55:16.780]  and it's due to the ripple when the fronts come through it makes the mackerels
[2:55:16.780 --> 2:55:24.340]  jump up and or get active I should say or bite. The skies they chemtrail down
[2:55:24.340 --> 2:55:27.740]  here quite a bit my kids noticed it they know that the bad chemicals and all this
[2:55:27.740 --> 2:55:32.540]  and there's proof that they were using the harp and if you think about it
[2:55:32.540 --> 2:55:35.980]  what else would make all these birds drop out of the sky at one time. Well there's
[2:55:35.980 --> 2:55:41.020]  also a poison called starling side that we saw at the time but the way
[2:55:41.020 --> 2:55:44.300]  everybody reported the birds basically all fell at once and their insides
[2:55:44.300 --> 2:55:49.380]  were pulverized the state veterinarians and then locals also tested them and did
[2:55:49.380 --> 2:55:53.380]  not find the starling side there were some mass bird die-offs last year that
[2:55:53.380 --> 2:55:58.140]  were connected to that even though it's uses reportedly restricted so who knows
[2:55:58.140 --> 2:56:01.780]  who knows a big mystery I think it's hard to say a hundred percent we know
[2:56:01.780 --> 2:56:07.460]  harp did it I saw some of the radar images of this big red cell right over
[2:56:07.460 --> 2:56:11.100]  it but that could also been an intense storm look I don't know you know there's
[2:56:11.100 --> 2:56:14.620]  so many things I can't really speculate on but thank you Martin Charles in
[2:56:14.620 --> 2:56:18.700]  Detroit you're on the air welcome Charles just dropped off I wanted to hear
[2:56:18.700 --> 2:56:23.580]  what they had to say about the CPS SWAT teaming Josh in Arkansas you're on the
[2:56:23.580 --> 2:56:32.060]  air hey Josh okay when it rains at pores Chris in Wisconsin you're on the
[2:56:32.060 --> 2:56:41.380]  air I'm here welcome a couple ideas for yet first of all I have an e-base store
[2:56:41.380 --> 2:56:46.420]  and at the top of every one of my listings I have a dose of truth in
[2:56:46.420 --> 2:56:52.020]  four wars dot com and I posted they're seen by you know one to 300 people a
[2:56:52.020 --> 2:56:59.740]  piece so every person you reach with a message of liberty is incalculable in
[2:56:59.740 --> 2:57:02.980]  the aggregate when everybody's doing it a lot of folks right on the Federal
[2:57:02.980 --> 2:57:06.260]  Reserve notes a lot of people you know put stickers on their cars a lot of
[2:57:06.260 --> 2:57:10.420]  people start their own blog or website what we also have this little widget at
[2:57:10.420 --> 2:57:15.460]  the bottom of info wars dot com where you can just place a player on your site
[2:57:15.460 --> 2:57:18.540]  and we've got different sizes of it where people can see it no I want to
[2:57:18.540 --> 2:57:22.140]  check out that radio show I mean but again I'm not the end all be all it's
[2:57:22.140 --> 2:57:26.580]  just all of us in an effort against tyranny put that put the same thing on
[2:57:26.580 --> 2:57:32.700]  my postings on bulletin boards and also my signature on text and the second
[2:57:32.700 --> 2:57:36.140]  that's a couple of just an idea for new people who are trying to figure out
[2:57:36.140 --> 2:57:41.820]  something they can do and another thing we can do I saw the success of the
[2:57:41.820 --> 2:57:47.940]  Google Google bomb yesterday we have similar chasing music and if a song I
[2:57:47.940 --> 2:57:52.100]  think you've overlooked is talking about a revolution by Tracy Chapman and
[2:57:52.100 --> 2:57:56.980]  maybe if we could start a YouTube bomb type thing make that the number one song
[2:57:56.980 --> 2:58:01.580]  on a video on YouTube talking about a revolution by Tracy Chapman it's a 20
[2:58:01.580 --> 2:58:06.100]  year old song I'm out of time but that's a great idea and I appreciate your call
[2:58:06.100 --> 2:58:09.140]  good to hear from you and I'm sorry to the other callers I'll be back live
[2:58:09.140 --> 2:58:13.100]  tomorrow 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central the retransmissions coming up where I break
[2:58:13.100 --> 2:58:17.860]  down Obama's speech and all these new tax increases are announcing and will
[2:58:17.860 --> 2:58:21.780]  this fix the deficit well I break it down it absolutely will not it'll give the
[2:58:21.780 --> 2:58:25.940]  bankers more power they're the problem their fractional reserve banking system
[2:58:25.940 --> 2:58:29.740]  by the way we did make one of the search terms number one that they censored it
[2:58:29.740 --> 2:58:33.660]  looks like the TSA terms we're going with a very simple TSA search term today
[2:58:33.660 --> 2:58:53.140]  let's make it number one don't forget the Google bomb TSA lies TSA lies TSA lies
