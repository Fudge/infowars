[00:00.000 --> 00:11.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.440 --> 00:19.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.000 --> 00:33.080]  Texas Alex Jones all right folks we have a very important obvious broadcast line
[00:33.080 --> 00:38.000]  before you today we always cover incredibly information we always cover
[00:38.000 --> 00:45.920]  information of the greatest import I was up last night doing a lot of research
[00:45.920 --> 00:51.680]  going over a lot of information that I want to attempt to get to today we don't
[00:51.680 --> 00:59.200]  have any gas today other than the mayor of court site where the police chief and
[00:59.200 --> 01:04.560]  others have reportedly declared civil emergency or martial law because the
[01:04.560 --> 01:10.960]  citizens are upset about what they believe to be corruption and it's a
[01:10.960 --> 01:13.920]  microcosm of what's happening in the rest of the country and we've been
[01:13.920 --> 01:20.680]  following it in the last two weeks since a lady was of course arrested for
[01:20.680 --> 01:24.960]  simply asking questions during citizens communication during the time she was a
[01:24.960 --> 01:29.400]  lot of to speak even though the mayor said let her speak she was arrested and
[01:29.400 --> 01:34.200]  this is the essence of tyranny if governments are able to start behaving
[01:34.200 --> 01:38.720]  like this and I'm seeing more and more type videos and reports coming out then
[01:38.720 --> 01:45.640]  we are in serious serious trouble now that said the mayor is just popping in
[01:45.640 --> 01:52.880]  for about five minutes at the start of the radio broadcast well at the start of
[01:52.880 --> 01:57.800]  the eight after second segment in my mind I think of that really is the
[01:57.800 --> 02:03.840]  official kickoff of the show because some stations don't carry these first
[02:03.840 --> 02:14.360]  little five-minute segments and I told my producers get the mayor on and I also in
[02:14.360 --> 02:17.360]  one side of my mind no was intending not to have guests today so I could cover
[02:17.360 --> 02:20.680]  news and take calls so I just looked down at my guest list right before I went
[02:20.680 --> 02:25.360]  live that's why I was like because I saw he's coming up right after the break so
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.760]  my brain kind of reset there I was also very very late I basically got no sleep
[02:30.760 --> 02:38.800]  so I'm always slowly warming up once I get on air when I haven't had any sleep
[02:38.800 --> 02:45.960]  really to speak up I feel great I just the brain does not crackle at first with
[02:45.960 --> 02:51.720]  as much direct connection to all the knowledge and data normally my brain is
[02:51.720 --> 02:57.520]  moving so fast that that's another problem and then I start gibbering now
[02:57.520 --> 03:05.320]  that I'm trying to cover so much so much information looking at this news I don't
[03:05.320 --> 03:11.360]  know where to start we have the incredible meet the press interview
[03:11.360 --> 03:16.000]  Sunday with Geithner that I talked some about yesterday we're actually gonna play
[03:16.000 --> 03:19.920]  those clips here today where he said what's coming to America is gonna be
[03:19.920 --> 03:25.000]  worse than anything any of us have ever experienced and he called it also the
[03:25.000 --> 03:31.560]  greatest recession or the Great Recession it's a depression and the fact
[03:31.560 --> 03:34.400]  that they're now admitting that they've known all along that we were in a
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.680]  depression for at least three years just confirms everything we already knew but
[03:39.680 --> 03:49.040]  it's still shocking to see it happening it's one thing to intellectually know
[03:49.040 --> 03:52.360]  this is what private central banks have done all over the world over and over
[03:52.360 --> 03:58.000]  again but it's another thing entirely to see it really happening and to know
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.160]  that the depression is only gonna get worse and worse and then under
[04:01.160 --> 04:05.960]  globalism were designed to never come out of this and that this is a planned
[04:05.960 --> 04:10.760]  implosion of the economy and they put out all these white papers and it is so
[04:10.760 --> 04:17.680]  rich in a disgusting way to watch the very criminals who publicly engineered
[04:17.680 --> 04:21.560]  all this publicly tell everybody that they're gonna save us and take good care
[04:21.560 --> 04:25.760]  of us so we'll be talking about the debt limit fight the latest Fukushima news
[04:25.760 --> 04:31.480]  and really the biggest news even compared to the economy you know that's one
[04:31.480 --> 04:37.120]  crime being committed the fact that fast and furious is now really becoming the
[04:37.120 --> 04:49.160]  scandal it needs to be and you've got multiple more patrol agents killed also
[04:49.160 --> 04:53.800]  Ron Paul's announced he's retired from the house wow I miss is a this is a

[08:05.360 --> 08:16.480]  radio network it is Tuesday the 12th day of July 2011 we're gonna be here live
[08:16.480 --> 08:22.000]  for the next three hours we're gonna have wide-open phones and incredible
[08:22.000 --> 08:27.920]  amounts of absolutely vital news this is a broadcast that is all about living in
[08:27.920 --> 08:33.560]  the real world facing reality two plus two equals four Obama is becoming a
[08:33.560 --> 08:37.640]  dictator launching wars without congressional approval say he's gonna
[08:37.640 --> 08:42.160]  sign executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment passing carbon taxes
[08:42.160 --> 08:47.440]  without Congress passing laws of course Obama will leave office
[08:47.440 --> 08:51.440]  undoubtedly it is the office being turned into a dictatorship we're going
[08:51.440 --> 08:55.240]  to be breaking that down today we're gonna be facing the fact that two plus
[08:55.240 --> 08:59.120]  two does equal four and that the tyranny we're seeing does equal
[08:59.120 --> 09:04.880]  despotism and corruption and that if you study societies and nations and in
[09:04.880 --> 09:09.000]  modern societies as well once countries get to this point they either descend
[09:09.000 --> 09:15.720]  into absolute nightmare oppression or the people wake up stand up speak out and
[09:15.720 --> 09:19.680]  start getting in the face of corrupt individuals everywhere and turn the tide
[09:19.680 --> 09:30.840]  but we are at the crossroads we have some very sad news but also news of a
[09:30.840 --> 09:39.200]  mission of freedom that has not been rivaled in modern history and a
[09:39.200 --> 09:46.200]  dedication to stick into his guns and not compromising and Ron Paul has driven
[09:46.200 --> 09:50.720]  himself like no one I've ever known doing as many as 10 interviews a day
[09:50.720 --> 09:57.040]  reading all the major legislation Ron Paul does work on average 18 hours a day
[09:57.040 --> 10:05.920]  18 hours a day at 75 almost 76 years old many times talking to him privately or
[10:05.920 --> 10:10.440]  on the air he always knows every news item that I'm aware of that had just
[10:10.440 --> 10:15.720]  come out he voraciously reads and researches he's an economist a medical
[10:15.720 --> 10:22.080]  doctor a father and Ron Paul has announced that when or lose obviously
[10:22.080 --> 10:25.520]  he wins he won't be running for reelection in the house but if he loses
[10:25.520 --> 10:29.920]  he's going to be leaving the house of representatives and he will not be
[10:29.920 --> 10:38.000]  seeking reelection so Ron Paul will of course be out of office out of the house
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.440]  one way or another in a year when or lose the GOP presidential nomination
[10:42.440 --> 10:46.240]  Texas representative Ron Paul says he won't run for another term in Congress
[10:46.240 --> 10:50.120]  in a message posted on his Facebook page Paul said he will not run for
[10:50.120 --> 10:55.360]  reelection next year to the US House I have decided not to seek reelection for
[10:55.360 --> 11:00.720]  the house seat in 2012 and will focus all of my energy winning the presidency
[11:00.720 --> 11:05.160]  he wrote so I'm glad he's all in and that's the way to do it because he would
[11:05.160 --> 11:19.000]  have to simultaneously run for the house he is all in and it's it's obviously
[11:19.000 --> 11:23.680]  something I'm going to be talking about more I just learned this five minutes
[11:23.680 --> 11:29.080]  ago and I'll have more comments later I'm obviously going to do a special
[11:29.080 --> 11:33.280]  report on this that will put on prison planet TV and we'll premiere tomorrow
[11:33.280 --> 11:39.560]  on the radio and we've obviously need to really get behind the campaign because
[11:39.560 --> 11:46.240]  either way you slice it congressman Ron Paul has really exposed the globalist at
[11:46.240 --> 11:50.360]  this critical juncture and if it wasn't for the people that have supported Ron
[11:50.360 --> 11:54.520]  Paul in the last election in this election we wouldn't be as far along as
[11:54.520 --> 11:59.840]  we are in awakening not just people here in the US but worldwide to the private
[11:59.840 --> 12:03.080]  Federal Reserve the whole global government movement the carbon taxes
[12:03.080 --> 12:07.880]  the fraudulent wars all of it he's a true constitutionalist and we salute
[12:07.880 --> 12:12.840]  congressman Ron Paul and we're going to a guest here in just a moment the other
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.600]  big news I'm going to be covering in detail patrol agents family calling for
[12:17.600 --> 12:24.280]  justice the family of a murdered Border Patrol agent Brian Terry and there's
[12:24.280 --> 12:27.680]  several others that have been killed that are getting ready to sue as well
[12:27.680 --> 12:33.600]  say that they are preparing to they're looking at suing the federal government
[12:33.600 --> 12:37.800]  including Attorney General Eric Holder the head of the ATF and others for
[12:37.800 --> 12:43.200]  shipping tens of thousands of firearms into Mexico as a pretext they've
[12:43.200 --> 12:46.440]  already launched this program last year to demonize the Second Amendment and
[12:46.440 --> 12:52.120]  blame the total collapse of Mexico and the failed state on the Second
[12:52.120 --> 12:57.360]  Amendment so it was double-edged to destabilize Mexico but also move to ban
[12:57.360 --> 13:02.680]  semi-automatic firearms sales shut down gun shows restrict gun shops and put
[13:02.680 --> 13:09.600]  people on no gun by list just like the no-fly list extra judiciary and they've
[13:09.600 --> 13:14.000]  been caught completely this this is a thousand times what Nixon did this is
[13:14.000 --> 13:19.240]  ten times what Clinton ever did I mean this is so out in the open red-handed
[13:19.240 --> 13:24.000]  and I've got to tell you the good news I listened to W.O.A.I. and 590 K.L.B.J. this
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.080]  morning and randomly tuning in both of the local shows we're saying one of
[13:30.080 --> 13:35.840]  them is liberal to a certain extent arrest Holder that this is criminal that
[13:35.840 --> 13:39.360]  it's a false flag to blame it on the Second Amendment that it staged terror so
[13:39.360 --> 13:43.320]  we've gotten that meme out there we've gotten that talking point of truth out
[13:43.320 --> 13:47.720]  and we are hurting the globalist bad we can bring them down with this like I'm
[13:47.720 --> 13:50.360]  getting chills right now we're gonna be covering that coming up at the bottom of
[13:50.360 --> 13:53.880]  the hour this is so important I need to compose myself before I get into this and
[13:53.880 --> 13:58.280]  and try to put out some ideas that can really really energize the movement to
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.040]  bring these these of these murderers that they are murderers by extension and
[14:02.040 --> 14:05.960]  then should be charged as such I mean if I went and sold guns to criminals and it
[14:05.960 --> 14:13.080]  killed cops I I could get capital murder for that premeditated so capital might
[14:13.080 --> 14:17.960]  be hard definitely murder I don't know about murder one but we're gonna be
[14:17.960 --> 14:22.080]  going over all of that just incredible news on so many fronts Southern
[14:22.080 --> 14:32.400]  Poverty Law Center is coming out and demonizing demonizing Rand Paul I want
[14:32.400 --> 14:37.960]  to go now to Ed Foster because this has become a focal point around the country
[14:37.960 --> 14:43.080]  court-signed Arizona he is the mayor there it's become a focal point because
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.800]  of the police chief and others declaring a civil emergency because Sunday
[14:48.800 --> 14:54.280]  because people are upset about the woman Jennifer Jones being arrested for
[14:54.280 --> 14:59.960]  simply asking questions during her citizens communication the mayor
[14:59.960 --> 15:04.000]  saying let her speak and then this example of tyranny has drawn campaign for
[15:04.000 --> 15:10.280]  liberty the oath keepers and everybody to court side so we're watching this
[15:10.280 --> 15:16.120]  closely mayor thank you for joining us thank you for having me Alex you know
[15:16.120 --> 15:22.120]  you're showing your audience that really carried the ball in this thing it
[15:22.120 --> 15:27.480]  it's made it an international story and that's international support it's been
[15:27.480 --> 15:34.760]  overwhelming right now well sir let's absolutely this has become an
[15:34.760 --> 15:38.600]  international issue this is just out of the Arizona Republic and Associated
[15:38.600 --> 15:44.240]  Press Arizona town and disarray mayor alleges corruption you of course are
[15:44.240 --> 15:50.560]  elected there sir and so I guess this is martial law is it true that you have
[15:50.560 --> 15:55.920]  now been fired by these people well effectively I'll tell you what what
[15:55.920 --> 16:01.120]  should declare a state of emergency the chief executive the highest elected
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.000]  official is the one that's supposed to be in charge but this council has had an
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.440]  illegal meeting Sunday which the Attorney General has finally got so many
[16:09.440 --> 16:14.520]  emails and letters and complaints and he sent out an email yesterday everyone
[16:14.520 --> 16:19.400]  said he hadn't received a formal complaint about an illegal meeting so I
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.000]  rushed out we had no power I rushed over to California yesterday afternoon and I
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.400]  made sure he got at least one formal complaint signed by the mayor of
[16:28.400 --> 16:32.920]  court side about their illegal meeting any interesting part of that is during
[16:32.920 --> 16:37.240]  an illegal meeting any action taken is no one's voice because all business that
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.760]  an illegal meeting is therefore illegal so we are technically not under a state
[16:42.760 --> 16:46.800]  of emergency even though the chief of police and the town manager think they
[16:46.800 --> 16:51.440]  are no no I understand I mean I mean how do they fire the mayor how do they
[16:51.440 --> 16:55.040]  send a SWAT team to your house Sunday demanding you come to a meeting and you
[16:55.040 --> 17:00.960]  get there and say this is illegal this meeting they came to my door and they
[17:00.960 --> 17:05.560]  said you are required to be a town hall and I wait a minute you know my
[17:05.560 --> 17:10.160]  relationship with this chief he had not he had a vest on this that police you
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.280]  know that whatever they call that I don't think it's right here but it is you
[17:14.280 --> 17:19.160]  know I'm not on they were dressed up for war but sort of be specific so so they
[17:19.160 --> 17:23.600]  declared the civil emergency folks were able to hear it through the window we
[17:23.600 --> 17:29.840]  we've now got a copy of it basically it is martial law and now well they again
[17:29.840 --> 17:33.760]  they think they have been this morning here in a few minutes there's going to
[17:33.760 --> 17:39.280]  be a illegal meeting or at least they think they're it they have called change
[17:39.280 --> 17:43.840]  the schedule of the meeting from 7 p.m. this evening to morning because they
[17:43.840 --> 17:48.040]  didn't think anybody here and already the crowds are starting to gather for the
[17:48.040 --> 17:52.960]  meeting but basically when this meeting is half of the 10 o'clock from the
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.640]  podium I am going to announce that this is the result of an illegal act during
[17:57.640 --> 18:02.120]  the illegal meeting they had Sunday this I will not compound the other
[18:02.120 --> 18:07.200]  illegality of it I'm canceling this meeting I will have a rescheduled in a
[18:07.200 --> 18:10.720]  facility sir I feel like I'm in the twilight zone this is the associated
[18:10.720 --> 18:14.600]  press thousands are traveling to your town I'm told hundreds and hundreds of
[18:14.600 --> 18:18.480]  people are already traveled there it says the far western Arizona town of
[18:18.480 --> 18:22.560]  Quartz site was in disarray after the town council ousted the mayor you're
[18:22.560 --> 18:29.120]  elected from power and declared a state of emergency all over my power this
[18:29.120 --> 18:33.720]  morning this is going to be a three-ring circus here this morning
[18:33.720 --> 18:37.400]  oh wait wait wait wait wait so you're gonna go have a showdown literally at
[18:37.400 --> 18:42.160]  high noon Arizona time and say look you may claim that the elected mayor in the
[18:42.160 --> 18:45.960]  mayor you may claim because you got guns you know this happened famously in
[18:45.960 --> 18:51.000]  Tennessee in a case where we're gonna we're gonna do this in 10 o'clock here
[18:51.000 --> 18:57.240]  in about 45 minutes we're going to do this and even if two people were in the
[18:57.240 --> 19:02.080]  up this whole schedule of a meeting at 10 a.m. in the morning and an attempt to do
[19:02.080 --> 19:06.000]  this when the citizens of Quartz site are busy with their lives and can't come
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.840]  to this meeting that's why they did it also the chief has went through I'm
[19:09.840 --> 19:14.880]  looking around me now on the chair of all kinds of outside police forces are
[19:14.880 --> 19:19.680]  here on the scene he wants to make this look so and he is the one that's
[19:19.680 --> 19:25.160]  inciting and if you look at the videos of our meeting when he arrested my
[19:25.160 --> 19:30.680]  boss and when he arrested Jones he was inciting the people you know he is
[19:30.680 --> 19:35.400]  mayor this is what's key sir sir causing the problem you know sir we're gonna
[19:35.400 --> 19:38.240]  skip this break we'll have a few more minutes with you this network break is
[19:38.240 --> 19:42.280]  it so important and obviously I feel like I've just fallen into the twilight
[19:42.280 --> 19:46.680]  zone here you're the elected mayor they were arresting people that try to speak
[19:46.680 --> 19:51.360]  politely during citizens communications they they declared an
[19:51.360 --> 19:56.240]  emergency they say they fired you so literally they're now becoming kings and
[19:56.240 --> 20:03.240]  from what I just heard you say that the local the the sheriff it sounds like is
[20:03.240 --> 20:08.920]  teaming up with the police chief I don't want to go there because there's you
[20:08.920 --> 20:15.000]  know the 80% majority of the police force that actually really just well this
[20:15.000 --> 20:22.280]  up they are really good officers they are old their own keepers no no no no I
[20:22.280 --> 20:26.080]  know that 80% of the cops support you there and that's good but but the mayor
[20:26.080 --> 20:30.800]  what I'm saying is from what you said he's declared the emergency so now the
[20:30.800 --> 20:35.840]  mayor is gone he's he's saying I'm boss I'm king I'm God that's the nature of
[20:35.840 --> 20:39.440]  tyranny but but but expanding you're saying we're not gonna let him get by
[20:39.440 --> 20:44.280]  well I know but you're saying he's got he's he's called in other police I guess
[20:44.280 --> 20:49.040]  behaving like you're the bad guys is my point that's right okay mayor mayor
[20:49.040 --> 20:52.960]  you've got the floor is this the existence with the show force that
[20:52.960 --> 20:58.560]  always were in a seats mentality and the only reason they're in that is because
[20:58.560 --> 21:02.320]  so many thousands of people out there who heard your show and all the other
[21:02.320 --> 21:07.840]  shows out there have written in sent them emails you know and I've really
[21:07.840 --> 21:12.880]  gotten copied most of them and I really have never seen a threat I mean they're
[21:12.880 --> 21:18.080]  really telling it like it is you know you're you're not respecting free speech
[21:18.080 --> 21:22.120]  what are you doing in court say blah blah blah and that there I have not seen
[21:22.120 --> 21:28.320]  any kind of letter that really comes down as a threat but these people are
[21:28.320 --> 21:32.520]  it they don't want people asking them what they're doing they don't want to be
[21:32.520 --> 21:35.200]  doing their business in front of the public that's why that when they had
[21:35.200 --> 21:39.040]  that meeting Sunday they locked the door they didn't want anybody to see that
[21:39.040 --> 21:42.080]  happen mayor let me just ask one question and then I want to give you the
[21:42.080 --> 21:46.160]  floor for the next five six minutes till we go to break so you can lay out from
[21:46.160 --> 21:50.880]  beginning to end what has happened and where you're going from this point but
[21:50.880 --> 21:57.880]  see how good people under tyranny even try to argue is that hey we're not bad
[21:57.880 --> 22:02.880]  people obviously we aren't now if a police chief ever gets some emails
[22:02.880 --> 22:07.880]  criticizing arresting people for free speech now they get to fire the mayor
[22:07.880 --> 22:13.280]  I mean if I sent an email to Austin police chief Ardei Savetta and said I
[22:13.280 --> 22:17.800]  think you're a federal thug for taking federal money to take blood at warrantless
[22:17.800 --> 22:23.560]  checkpoints would he then fire the mayor shut down the city council call in
[22:23.560 --> 22:27.880]  outside police and declare himself emperor I mean let's look at the mind game
[22:27.880 --> 22:33.840]  the delusion of tyranny that tyrants give us this is asinine this is naked
[22:33.840 --> 22:39.120]  brazen out-of-control ridiculousness in court site you are the mayor they have
[22:39.120 --> 22:43.640]  told the AP and the news is announcing the well I guess the cops say the mayor
[22:43.640 --> 22:49.720]  is fired so he is so so so now I guess if the police and the city council say
[22:49.720 --> 22:53.520]  that our mayor is fired he is I mean why even have a city council so I'm gonna
[22:53.520 --> 22:57.240]  stop right there sir tell us what's happened from beginning to end the
[22:57.240 --> 23:00.440]  people that are massing there what's happening the showdown that's coming
[23:00.440 --> 23:05.880]  you've got the floor okay first off it's always about money when I got
[23:05.880 --> 23:11.040]  involved in politics in court site I'm an engineer and they were spending 250
[23:11.040 --> 23:16.080]  the half a million dollars every month on engineering I look around our quiet
[23:16.080 --> 23:20.160]  little community out here I saw those big projects going on but the money kept
[23:20.160 --> 23:26.280]  going out I got involved because I was concerned it's always about the money
[23:26.280 --> 23:29.480]  when I got elected I thought I could go in the back room and look at the books
[23:29.480 --> 23:33.720]  that don't happen because they shut me down they took away the authority to
[23:33.720 --> 23:37.680]  bear right from the beginning even before I was sworn into office so that
[23:37.680 --> 23:42.080]  was elected the former mayor cast ordinances to depriving the mayor of
[23:42.080 --> 23:46.000]  authority and every time I've used any authority to bear they take it away
[23:46.000 --> 23:50.760]  immediately I asked the town manager for a report the next council meeting the
[23:50.760 --> 23:54.360]  council passed an ordinance says elected officials can't ask for a report
[23:54.360 --> 23:58.960]  unless the whole council approved you know so I mean they shut me down shut me
[23:58.960 --> 24:04.400]  down shut me down but I kept after my use the FOIA documents and I free
[24:04.400 --> 24:08.000]  finally figured out that there's eight to ten extra paychecks going out every
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.280]  payday every two weeks eight to ten check thousand dollars each we're talking
[24:13.280 --> 24:16.800]  about a quarter of a million dollars out of a three million dollar budget pretty
[24:16.800 --> 24:22.600]  significant huh I went to the state tried to get the state to do it they
[24:22.600 --> 24:27.160]  actually open an investigation but it moves slowly and that's why they're
[24:27.160 --> 24:31.280]  acting so scared and that's why they're so dangerous because they know yeah
[24:31.280 --> 24:37.200]  they're trapped their corner and their reaction is to not to say oh my god maybe
[24:37.200 --> 24:42.120]  we better get out there their action is to try to see more power and more power
[24:42.120 --> 24:47.920]  and they actually contrived if you look at the videos the chief instituted
[24:47.920 --> 24:52.760]  himself into the business of the council he incited the audience and created the
[24:52.760 --> 24:58.080]  situation where mr. Ross was arrested the meeting before Miss Jones was arrested
[24:58.080 --> 25:02.720]  at the next meeting you know he's he's trying to institute this emergency
[25:02.720 --> 25:07.640]  procedure so that he can seize control of the town he's running a scyop that's
[25:07.640 --> 25:10.960]  what corrupt cops do when they come up and shove you and say why are you upset
[25:10.960 --> 25:15.000]  why are you upset and I've learned to just look down and just just stop talking
[25:15.000 --> 25:18.880]  and they get really mad but yeah they try to start a fight with you one night
[25:18.880 --> 25:24.000]  at console podium he got up and he called me arrogant because I just said
[25:24.000 --> 25:27.720]  at the podium and smiled at him and I'm trying to get the people out there in
[25:27.720 --> 25:31.880]  this little box county and puts like to do the same don't let him incite you
[25:31.880 --> 25:38.360]  because if he incites you he's going victim to his plan you know if you just
[25:38.360 --> 25:41.800]  smile at him you take all of his the power is the way you know he has no
[25:41.800 --> 25:47.800]  power and truthfully in the end we have to win you know we are going to win the
[25:47.800 --> 25:51.560]  state is fighting thanks to all your listeners and all the people the state
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.360]  is waking up to this you know well I mean I mean who needs mayors or anybody
[25:56.360 --> 26:00.760]  anymore I guess once you put a police chief in we'll just why not build a
[26:00.760 --> 26:05.080]  throne in the city building and put I'm serious and declare him emperor of
[26:05.080 --> 26:09.600]  courtside well what what what we do need and I'll tell you what what you're
[26:09.600 --> 26:14.080]  what I am you know I have used your listeners than the people that are
[26:14.080 --> 26:17.920]  calling I've asked them to contact the governor and the attorney general and
[26:17.920 --> 26:22.480]  that has had an effect okay but the other effect of this has been I've
[26:22.480 --> 26:27.440]  literally seen thousands of emails hundreds of calls a day and it's amazing
[26:27.440 --> 26:32.720]  how much this story is the similar all over the country my brother started this
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.480]  down in Okaloosa County Florida and if you look up Okaloosa County and their
[26:36.480 --> 26:42.560]  sheriff I think it was here I'm not so thoroughly thoroughly something down
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.440]  there my brother got him arrested the under sheriff arrested couple county
[26:47.440 --> 26:52.800]  board supervisors arrested and you know I'm sort of following his template the
[26:52.800 --> 26:56.480]  other day I've spoken about that the lady from Florida called me she wanted to
[26:56.480 --> 27:01.800]  contact my brother and she I gave her my brother's number she contacted the 60
[27:01.800 --> 27:06.320]  year old lady was attending council meeting taking notes she probably didn't
[27:06.320 --> 27:09.880]  know that she'd go and get a footed document get the meat beating minutes
[27:09.880 --> 27:14.640]  but she was taking notes a council member got up and went to her and shook
[27:14.640 --> 27:18.880]  his finger in her face and said you're a bad person I mean imagine that in a
[27:18.880 --> 27:23.160]  minute yeah they got they got something to hide look here's the deal and you
[27:23.160 --> 27:28.200]  know this mayor we the people constitute states the legislatures institute the
[27:28.200 --> 27:33.440]  laws and when cities and counties don't follow it and and if the sheriff won't
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.720]  enforce the law it's time for the state police to roll in and it's time for that
[27:38.720 --> 27:42.560]  city council to be clamped down and everything to be opened up and that's
[27:42.560 --> 27:46.200]  what's supposed to happen here you've definitely got rogue government there and
[27:46.200 --> 27:50.520]  it's time for the state to step up if the state doesn't step up then you've
[27:50.520 --> 27:56.320]  got a very dangerous precedent right there in Arizona exactly before I go
[27:56.320 --> 27:59.480]  away for me because I got to get to this meeting yes sir I want I want to make
[27:59.480 --> 28:04.760]  sure that you understand that when these 80% of the police force decided that
[28:04.760 --> 28:09.920]  they were had enough and they were gonna stand up for rights and really they
[28:09.920 --> 28:13.600]  wrote this letter it's out there all over the internet for all of these people
[28:13.600 --> 28:19.440]  you know I went to the governor's office I'm an engineer and I'm a fairly new
[28:19.440 --> 28:24.440]  politician here and I was like I told him I don't know what's what do I do here
[28:24.440 --> 28:30.280]  what how can you help is there's something you've with all of this mess
[28:30.280 --> 28:34.200]  that's going on I got told there was nothing they could do the attorney general
[28:34.200 --> 28:38.920]  could do nothing but again the publicity the emails and the letters that have
[28:38.920 --> 28:42.600]  been directed to those two offices they're changed their attitude now again
[28:42.600 --> 28:45.920]  they don't let me stop because we're almost out of time and I want to check
[28:45.920 --> 28:48.080]  in with you towards the end of the show after the meeting and we're gonna check
[28:48.080 --> 28:51.240]  them with Stuart Rhodes and others that are there but please sir in the last
[28:51.240 --> 28:54.680]  minute what is the showdown you're gonna show up say I'm the elected mayor
[28:54.680 --> 28:59.400]  under state law this is illegal and what do you think well first off the
[28:59.400 --> 29:03.000]  declaration of an emergency was done at an illegal meeting therefore it's
[29:03.000 --> 29:08.160]  illegal null and void okay that can't happen but this meeting that is scheduled
[29:08.160 --> 29:15.720]  at a time in place that wasn't on the on the town coast it's illegal and we're
[29:15.720 --> 29:19.440]  not gonna have this meeting this morning and that's the showdown I'm telling
[29:19.440 --> 29:23.680]  them this is the new legal meeting we cannot have it we're closing down the
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.520]  meeting right now I'm walking away if they decide to go ahead then they will
[29:28.520 --> 29:34.320]  get another complaint to the attorney general's office immediately I will call
[29:34.320 --> 29:38.320]  the attorney general with this complaint well also you should try to enter I'm
[29:38.320 --> 29:42.640]  not gonna let them take over the town and violate even the town rules you know
[29:42.640 --> 29:46.640]  they're there in violation of state laws violation of federal civil rights laws
[29:46.640 --> 29:52.240]  but they're not gonna mayor Ed Foster thank you so much we're on the March the

[34:11.120 --> 34:17.000]  can give his full focus his last big push and either way when loser draw he
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.680]  educates people he injects real issues he shows both the Democrats and
[34:21.680 --> 34:26.600]  Republicans are bought and paid for by the very same interest that's why the
[34:26.600 --> 34:31.680]  Republican front runners are all trying to adopt Ron Paul ask speech because
[34:31.680 --> 34:37.360]  they know that the American people are constitutionalist libertarian in their
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.720]  common sense mindset that's why the former IRS tax collector Michelle
[34:41.720 --> 34:47.240]  Bachman is now talking like Ron Paul that's why the former male cheerleader
[34:47.240 --> 34:53.840]  and Al Gore campaign manager in Texas for president slick Rick Perry is
[34:53.840 --> 34:57.280]  sounding like Ron Paul more and more every day that's why the guy that wrote
[34:57.280 --> 35:00.760]  the model of Obamacare for Massachusetts that became the model of
[35:00.760 --> 35:05.840]  Obamacare and a guy who wants carbon taxes Mitt Romney is being hailed as
[35:05.840 --> 35:11.840]  John Wayne because these people are as phony as a $3 bill so is Sarah Palin
[35:11.840 --> 35:16.200]  I'm not even saying Michelle Bachman's a bad person I'm not even saying that
[35:16.200 --> 35:22.120]  Sarah Palin's a bad person and obviously with their track records they're
[35:22.120 --> 35:27.200]  better than Barack Obama but it's time to end the lesser of two evils okay it's
[35:27.200 --> 35:34.320]  time to not go with the sexy candidates the you know the good-looking women just
[35:34.320 --> 35:39.480]  because it's a fun novelty and it's you know the beauty queens the tax
[35:39.480 --> 35:45.200]  assessors it's time to go with the statesman Ron Paul and to fully get
[35:45.200 --> 35:48.800]  behind him and to get as much information out about the New World Order
[35:48.800 --> 35:54.560]  and CIA narcotics trafficking that Ron Paul talks about and staged crises and
[35:54.560 --> 35:59.520]  all of it and we will win win win in the info war regardless of whether he wins
[35:59.520 --> 36:04.160]  or not and it will position Rand Paul who everybody says oh I wish he'd run I
[36:04.160 --> 36:07.600]  wish he'd run don't worry in the future he'll be running that's why they're now
[36:07.600 --> 36:12.240]  swinging their guns towards him the Southern Poverty Law Center very unsavory
[36:12.240 --> 36:17.600]  anti-American group has now labeling him an extremist and going into full-time
[36:17.600 --> 36:21.360]  demonization of him you saw all the dirty tricks by the Republicans in the
[36:21.360 --> 36:25.720]  primary and by Democrats in the general election for Senate pull out every stop
[36:25.720 --> 36:31.440]  he worships Buddha he's kidnapping women he hates black people that they
[36:31.440 --> 36:35.240]  hired Democratic operatives on record three times that got caught to run around
[36:35.240 --> 36:40.200]  with racist signs saying they supported Rand Paul I mean they've been caught all
[36:40.200 --> 36:44.200]  over the country doing this I mean these people will do anything and you know
[36:44.200 --> 36:48.440]  when they come after somebody that they're good they're going after Michelle
[36:48.440 --> 36:53.520]  Bachman right now which shows they are scared of her because she's probably
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.040]  grown up a lot since being an IRS tax collector and she's against the carbon
[36:58.040 --> 37:01.320]  tax and she says she's against the globalist and we have a choice liberty
[37:01.320 --> 37:05.120]  or tyranny and I'll tell you it when you you know the sniff test watching or
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.000]  looking at her she believes what she's saying and there no doubt tapping her
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.720]  phones tracking her I mean the media does that to major government
[37:13.720 --> 37:17.240]  personalities not not to mention intelligence agencies as it's come out
[37:17.240 --> 37:21.760]  with all the you know Fox News England news with them hacking and using
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.120]  criminals and things this is par for the course so I like Bachman more than
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.640]  more than more than Palin but this isn't a beauty contest and this is not a
[37:31.640 --> 37:38.360]  personality contest this is about track record okay Ron Paul was a patriot 40
[37:38.360 --> 37:43.080]  years ago he was a patriot 27 years ago in Congress and got run out of Congress
[37:43.080 --> 37:49.400]  as a libertarian he came back at using a Republican machine you know the the
[37:49.400 --> 37:55.200]  system and one and has been a stalwart a voice in the wilderness for decade upon
[37:55.200 --> 37:59.400]  decade upon decade and he's getting ready to hang up his spurs he'll either
[37:59.400 --> 38:06.080]  win the presidency and face as he said on this show great personal danger not
[38:06.080 --> 38:11.480]  just a political and and and danger to his name because they will make up
[38:11.480 --> 38:15.800]  anything about him just get ready for that but actually physical danger Ron
[38:15.800 --> 38:20.120]  Paul announces he will not run for reelection in the house again info wars
[38:20.120 --> 38:24.480]  calm curtain demo if you want to get that information and get it out to people
[38:24.480 --> 38:31.560]  now obviously we've been covering court site this is a big deal where the police
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.680]  chief and the city council quote fire the mayor because they got a few thousand
[38:35.680 --> 38:38.680]  emails and people saying hey you shouldn't arrest folks and citizen
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.000]  communications who get up there and talk about new taxes being passed illegally
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  I mean that's part of what America is and all over the country people got to
[38:48.000 --> 38:51.360]  the point where they just drive by government buildings and who that's
[38:51.360 --> 38:55.000]  the government and you call them sir and you bow to them they're the new
[38:55.000 --> 39:00.720]  royalty no America is about the people at the city council meetings the people
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.760]  knowing what's going on with the zoning boards this is our country and and
[39:05.760 --> 39:09.600]  government our servants have gotten out of control and all over the nation
[39:09.600 --> 39:13.480]  they're coming in in Michigan and Oklahoma and saying you can't grow
[39:13.480 --> 39:18.440]  vegetables without a license in your yard well ladies facing 90 days in jail
[39:18.440 --> 39:22.640]  even though the code says she can grow vegetables and if the code said she
[39:22.640 --> 39:27.720]  couldn't get rid of it but the code doesn't even say it that's NBC news
[39:27.720 --> 39:33.120]  admits that they don't care it's about their petty power trips see control
[39:33.120 --> 39:37.320]  freaks folks that can't produce tend to get into government positions because
[39:37.320 --> 39:41.560]  that's where they can have power it's called parasitism parasitic behavior
[39:41.560 --> 39:46.480]  and and and when you have servants in government you have a good society when
[39:46.480 --> 39:49.760]  you get a bunch of control freaks in there and when you get the attitude of
[39:49.760 --> 39:53.400]  well that's just what they do and and now all over the country if you speak out
[39:53.400 --> 39:57.280]  against corruption they go oh my gosh al-qaeda extremists call the police
[39:57.280 --> 40:02.080]  fire the mayor declare emergency nobody can ever speak again at city council
[40:02.080 --> 40:06.160]  meetings this is what the new world order is this is what the fake terror
[40:06.160 --> 40:10.360]  scare is what that police chief and court site do last year when they were
[40:10.360 --> 40:13.640]  getting up saying you're passing taxes where are these hundreds of thousands of
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.600]  dollars going who gets these mystery paychecks and they said we're not going
[40:17.600 --> 40:21.120]  to tell you you're like Jared Lee Loeffner I guess it was earlier this year
[40:21.120 --> 40:26.240]  shut up yeah January we're not going to discuss it I mean this is all on record
[40:26.240 --> 40:30.040]  and see it's become a real soap opera people aren't watching dancing with the
[40:30.040 --> 40:34.320]  stars or football or basketball or baseball people are doing what Americans
[40:34.320 --> 40:38.760]  always did before in other free societies the real soap opera is reality
[40:38.760 --> 40:43.280]  the real fight is knowing the personalities being involved not
[40:43.280 --> 40:48.120]  letting people run over you walk in tall you've got to fight for freedom and
[40:48.120 --> 40:51.440]  that doesn't mean killing some brown people overseas for their opium or
[40:51.440 --> 40:56.840]  their oil or for no bid weapons contracts that means here in America if you
[40:56.840 --> 41:00.560]  just drive by the government buildings and decide that well that's their place
[41:00.560 --> 41:04.360]  and they're the boss of course they're going to run wild of course they're
[41:04.360 --> 41:07.920]  going to engage in all sorts of corruption that's the nature of it so
[41:07.920 --> 41:13.960]  later I want to get into what what in fact you heard the mayor mention his
[41:13.960 --> 41:24.040]  brother exposing corruption and how it ended up sending the sheriff to prison
[41:25.600 --> 41:30.400]  I mean this is incredible so again you've got it genetic it's in the family
[41:30.400 --> 41:36.440]  with that mayor his brother right there in Arizona kicked off an investigation
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.800]  in another county that sent somebody to jail that sent a whole bunch of people
[41:40.800 --> 41:46.720]  to jail listen if you just threw food all over the ground in your house for a
[41:46.720 --> 41:50.880]  few months if you didn't have roaches you're gonna get them if you didn't have
[41:50.880 --> 41:55.240]  rats you're gonna get them well imagine this is like a kitchen that's had to
[41:55.240 --> 41:59.360]  light off for 20 years with a hundred pounds of food dumped in through the
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.360]  ceiling that's our tax money and you open up that room it's nothing but
[42:04.360 --> 42:09.000]  millions of cockroaches and rats running around everywhere you kick the door in
[42:09.000 --> 42:14.320]  almost anywhere and you are going to see horrors going on behind the closed
[42:14.320 --> 42:20.160]  doors of national security and local government and all the rest of this and
[42:20.160 --> 42:27.800]  I go back to the Battle of Athens in 1946 the Battle of Athens sometimes called
[42:27.800 --> 42:32.320]  the McMinn County War and all these World War two vets got back from World War
[42:32.320 --> 42:38.840]  two and a totally corrupt city council and sheriff's department and police
[42:38.840 --> 42:41.640]  department had taken over and we're robbing everybody and we're openly
[42:41.640 --> 42:46.120]  mafia and the World War two vets just voted them out in an election they
[42:46.120 --> 42:51.360]  wouldn't leave just like what's happening in court site and so the troops
[42:51.360 --> 42:56.520]  just went in just the citizens just like 1776 just went in they had a big
[42:56.520 --> 43:00.960]  shootout with them they finally waved the white flag and the state came in and
[43:00.960 --> 43:05.240]  found that it was just what the citizens had done it was a citizens rebellion
[43:05.240 --> 43:08.800]  against tyranny and you're gonna see this happen that's why the state of
[43:08.800 --> 43:13.240]  Arizona just says let that city do whatever they want because if you let
[43:13.240 --> 43:17.680]  one aunt stand up all the ants might stand up to the grasshoppers because this
[43:17.680 --> 43:21.640]  is going on everywhere they're jacking up taxes everywhere they're taking the
[43:21.640 --> 43:25.240]  money everywhere they're telling you you can't see the records everywhere they're
[43:25.240 --> 43:29.960]  engaged in all sorts of chicanery everywhere I mean our own city council has
[43:29.960 --> 43:35.280]  got their wives and kids hired and you know they got deals with developers and
[43:35.280 --> 43:39.480]  it's just it's it's it's it's we've just accepted that this is what they do that
[43:39.480 --> 43:44.120]  they lie steel sheet that that's what government does they've just accepted it
[43:44.120 --> 43:47.360]  with they've they think they've steamrollered us to where we'll go
[43:47.360 --> 43:51.360]  along with anything here's a modern example in Tennessee great folks there
[43:51.360 --> 44:02.680]  with a history of standing up this is going on in the town of Laverne and it's
[44:02.680 --> 44:08.160]  in the larger county Tennessee citizens try to abolish their city government
[44:08.160 --> 44:11.800]  citizens in the local town in Tennessee trying to abolish their city
[44:11.800 --> 44:15.120]  government this is one of the most encouraging stories of free individuals
[44:15.120 --> 44:19.240]  pushing back against tyrannical encroachment since the McMinn County
[44:19.240 --> 44:28.360]  War of 1946 government in Laverne I guess that's Laverne Tennessee recently
[44:28.360 --> 44:34.000]  raised property taxes on their citizens by 100% as the economy implodes that's
[44:34.000 --> 44:38.840]  serfdom folks raising their water utility rate by 40 and also raise their
[44:38.840 --> 44:44.320]  sewage rate by 60 it is any wonder that the residents want to do away with them
[44:44.320 --> 44:47.400]  here's the full story of the people's recent struggle against oppressive
[44:47.400 --> 44:52.920]  taxation that is taking place right next door to you and it and it goes on I
[44:52.920 --> 44:56.880]  mean this is what's happening ladies and gentlemen this is what's going on
[44:56.880 --> 45:03.960]  all over the country okaloosa County Sheriff arrested on federal charges in
[45:03.960 --> 45:10.040]  Arizona all of this triggered by the mayor's brother down there fighting the
[45:10.040 --> 45:15.280]  mayor oh this is in Florida okay so I have another one here out of Arizona
[45:15.280 --> 45:18.320]  there's just too many of these for me to keep track of ladies and gentlemen rob
[45:18.320 --> 45:25.600]  dudes running these articles into me one after the other okay now we've got the
[45:25.600 --> 45:31.920]  whole Ron Paul situation that I'm gonna be getting into more bureau shaken by
[45:31.920 --> 45:41.600]  debt crisis we've got a med Wally Karzai the admitted CIA drug kingpin the guy
[45:41.600 --> 45:46.560]  that muscles and controls most the opium in Afghanistan he has been killed
[45:46.560 --> 45:50.320]  he's the guy that US troops deliver the schmack tube before it shipped into
[45:50.320 --> 45:54.400]  Russia China Eastern Western Europe and of course the United States directly to
[45:54.400 --> 46:00.720]  you to your veins and so that's a big deal that's in the Washington post again
[46:00.720 --> 46:04.920]  New York Times admits he's the top heroin dealer does a good job for the
[46:04.920 --> 46:09.520]  Pentagon but he is dead now and who knows what happened with that was it some
[46:09.520 --> 46:12.280]  rival rival folks I mean that's what these wars are about that's what's
[46:12.280 --> 46:16.440]  happening right now in Mexico that's what fast and furious is all about
[46:16.440 --> 46:21.000]  arming the Los Zetas trained publicly at Fort Benning Georgia School of
[46:21.000 --> 46:25.000]  Americas in the last decade launching their attacks six years ago we told
[46:25.000 --> 46:29.400]  you about the new war coming that they would quote have a fake defection into
[46:29.400 --> 46:32.920]  their own drug gang they leave Fort Benning Georgia get to Mexico and then
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.520]  defect and then wage war against the drug cartels that aren't playing ball with
[46:37.520 --> 46:41.560]  the big US banks and the Mexican government of Felipe Calderon and now
[46:41.560 --> 46:44.880]  that's coming out in federal court in Chicago that's coming out in federal
[46:44.880 --> 46:49.640]  courts in Mexico that Los Zetas didn't just get the gun shipped out of the US
[46:49.640 --> 46:55.600]  from the ATF it was directly delivered to them by the DEA FBI and ATF of course
[46:55.600 --> 47:02.800]  and they're given rockets hand grenades RPGs and of course that's all blamed
[47:02.800 --> 47:06.920]  then on gun shows as well and we've seen now in the last two years Attorney General
[47:06.920 --> 47:13.480]  Eric Holder spending his time demonizing the Second Amendment non-stop saying
[47:13.480 --> 47:17.240]  we've got to restrict the Second Amendment because of Mexico and I told
[47:17.240 --> 47:20.200]  you the whole time that they were shipping the guns in and now you know
[47:20.200 --> 47:25.760]  it's all admitted correct as usual when you realize that absolute evil runs the
[47:25.760 --> 47:32.720]  government at the top and the naive compartmentalized people fill in the
[47:32.720 --> 47:37.800]  gaps at the lower level they put inept dumb gullible order followers at the
[47:37.800 --> 47:41.120]  bottom the mid-level a little more sociopathic control and get a bigger
[47:41.120 --> 47:46.240]  piece of the stolen loot the next crust level high level but still
[47:46.240 --> 47:51.040]  compartmentalized criminals and then at the top you've got the wheelers and
[47:51.040 --> 47:55.880]  dealers in your regional area who then go and attend criminal roundtable groups
[47:55.880 --> 48:02.400]  operating in government slash corporate slash academic roundtables and then you
[48:02.400 --> 48:07.040]  have the the national roundtables that coordinate those that then sit inside
[48:07.040 --> 48:10.680]  the larger global roundtables known as trilateral Commission Bilderberg group
[48:10.680 --> 48:17.360]  and other organizations and this is how they use a mafia capo system to run this
[48:17.360 --> 48:21.960]  whole thing because the British Empire and mainline history is basically a
[48:21.960 --> 48:28.040]  model of the Venetian black nobility system that was then exported into
[48:28.040 --> 48:33.920]  England about 550 years ago they had more of a feudal system before that and
[48:33.920 --> 48:38.920]  they brought in this this mafia behind-the-scenes corruption mode that
[48:38.920 --> 48:43.080]  the Machiavelli wrote about the term Machiavellian they've they wrote the
[48:43.080 --> 48:47.480]  handbooks on how to do all of this and Delta forces taught Machiavellian our
[48:47.480 --> 48:51.600]  military at the highest levels is taught how to be Machiavellian and if you
[48:51.600 --> 48:54.880]  don't agree with Machiavellian then you do not get promoted to the management
[48:54.880 --> 48:59.520]  levels that's on record they they give them Machiavellian he's to his two books
[48:59.520 --> 49:03.520]  and then they have to write reports on it and if you say that I don't believe
[49:03.520 --> 49:07.000]  the injustice the means and we're gonna be evil for a greater good at the end
[49:07.000 --> 49:12.960]  of the day then you're put in resupply or you're put you know in in training
[49:12.960 --> 49:18.000]  you know for the repelling out of helicopters but if you agree well then
[49:18.000 --> 49:23.080]  they send you to first kill a communist seems reasonable feels good and then
[49:23.080 --> 49:27.840]  next you you blow up somebody who was exposing corruption in their car and
[49:27.840 --> 49:31.360]  then next you go to somebody's house and you make it look like a murder
[49:31.360 --> 49:35.800]  suicide where dad kills the family and you kill mama and you kill the kids oh
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.040]  after that happens the million start pumping right into your account I mean
[49:39.040 --> 49:42.520]  this is wonderful and then you're just you're led into the Society of
[49:42.520 --> 49:46.560]  Psychopathic Killers and you can just walk around laughing at the sheep all
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.720]  around you that have no idea how anything runs and their blindness to

[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.000]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.760]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:13.280]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:16.840]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:21.240]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:25.520]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.280]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:33.400]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.120]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:41.200]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:43.920]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:49.920]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:16.400]  your mind all right we're gonna open the phones up coming up at 24 after then
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:21.760]  when we start the next segment throughout the entire second half of the
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:26.520]  transmission today we're now of course into hour number two it is Tuesday the
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:35.440]  12th day of July 2011 congressman Ron Paul has announced he will not run for
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:37.840]  reelection for the House representatives he's going all in for
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:43.320]  president and when loser draw that he will retire if he doesn't win obviously
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.800]  the presidency and will continue to work through the campaign for liberty and
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:54.520]  he's certainly worked hard for everyone and he will continue when loser draw to
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:00.240]  speak and to engage and to go on radio and TV as he said I don't know six
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.440]  months ago on the show he said you know I've been in Congress a while and we need
[01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:10.440]  to dig that clip up it's newsworthy and you know even if I retire from Congress
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:15.640]  I will continue to speak and be involved in issues of liberty because that's what
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:21.200]  my life's about I mean I couldn't see being alive and not not doing it so you
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.560]  know Ron Paul isn't going anywhere I hope he lives to be 110 of course that's
[01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:30.920]  the great thing about sons and daughters is that Rand is coming up strong and
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:36.160]  it's not disappointed in standing on constitutional principles and we salute
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:41.200]  the Paul family for their tireless work by the way next week let's get Wayne
[01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:45.880]  Paul his brother on and talk about Ron Paul and all the great things he's done
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:50.400]  and how we can get him into the White House but even if he loses he'll be
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:55.200]  injecting real issues and and exposing the false left-right paradigm and how
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:10:00.440]  both major parties are controlled so that is coming up as well the toll-tree
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:08.480]  number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-259-9231 we also the mayor of
[01:10:08.480 --> 01:10:13.240]  court side on the Associated Press reports that in the town that's now
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:18.160]  become an international story that they declared a civil emergency because
[01:10:18.160 --> 01:10:24.120]  people dare criticize the police chief for arresting people that speak during
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:28.600]  citizens communication politely and the mayor says they're allowed to speak
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:30.960]  they're here they're here on the citizens communications and they say nope
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.520]  we're the boss here and arrest them and they won't say the city council won't
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:41.200]  say where these phantom paychecks are going and this is all coming to a head
[01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:44.960]  right now and right about this time he's set to go to one of these closed door
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:48.480]  meetings they're having and and explain you you're not allowed to fire the mayor
[01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:53.120]  you're not God and so a confrontation is going on right now and the mayor has
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:57.360]  promised he will call in here first to give us the latest developments as that
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.800]  unfolds so stay with us could happen this hour or next hour but again your calls
[01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:09.440]  coming up 800 to 5 at 9 9231 okay I'm gonna get into fast and furious and the
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.280]  biggest development yet in a moment but first I talked a lot about this
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:20.240]  yesterday and it's it's it's really upsetting it's one thing to know how
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:23.800]  central banks work to know how fractional reserve banking works to know
[01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:26.840]  how they take down countries to have the IMF and World Bank documents that have
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:30.480]  been out for nine years since they got leaked when sticklets left the World Bank
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:35.960]  double prize winner for economics it's one thing to know they were planning
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:39.360]  this and I've written a book about it I've made films about it Obama deception
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:42.440]  fall the Republic it's one thing to know they're gonna do it but it's another
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:48.080]  thing to really see him do it it's like if you go to a hanging I guess and it's
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.440]  one thing to hear a hanging is coming but actually watch him throw the switch
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:57.200]  and the trap door fall and you know that next snap or a more modern since it's
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:00.000]  one thing to know a lethal injections coming up but then to witness one and
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:03.680]  watch the person get the shot and roll out and die like a dog that's been
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.280]  euthanized that it's happening they're pushing the needle in right now they're
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:14.160]  driving the plunger in right now and republics and societies and in
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:20.640]  humanity they don't die unless they die in spirit and so yes they are killing
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.800]  the Republic they are fully overturning the Bill of Rights and Constitution at
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.200]  every level right now many members of Congress admit the presidency has been
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:32.080]  turned into a bureaucratic dictatorship Congress is being rendered ceremonial
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:41.280]  right now on war taxes you name it we're in the middle of a war an info war and
[01:12:41.280 --> 01:12:45.120]  it's becoming a physical war and we need to try to fix things peacefully but the
[01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:49.160]  system wants it to be violent and as we go deeper into a depression you're
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.480]  gonna see more and more corrupt governments get out of control and
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:54.440]  you're gonna see more and more clashes that's what Homeland Security's been
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:59.320]  set up for is to suppress the American people now I'm gonna get into fast
[01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:04.840]  and furious but first I want to get in to the economic news again we told you
[01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:09.360]  that when they bailed out Ireland that the problems will only get worse in
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.520]  Ireland because the debt isn't theirs it's designed to bring you deeper into
[01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:17.780]  indebtedness like a loan shark we told you there'd be a first bail out of
[01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:20.880]  Greece a second and then they want a third they're now in the news calling
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.320]  for a third they need one for Italy Portugal they now admit that will
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:29.280]  bankrupt the entire euro and it's going to happen the banksters put the
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:33.880]  politicians into power put their people into power for this program to bankrupt
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:38.160]  the planet and on the ashes of it introduce the global digital SDR
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:44.520]  carbon tax and the AT tax grid and that's now the solution CNN ABC News
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.960]  Times of London you're being told that's the answer for two years they've come
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:51.640]  out of the closet and said yeah world governments the answer we're gonna save
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:55.280]  you now the conspiracy theorists were wrong that we were gonna set this up but
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:59.640]  we're setting up exactly what they said we'd set up conspiracy theorists or
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.240]  folks that are informed people that know the branches of government people that
[01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.280]  know that having the TSA graduate genitals is wrong they now call you a
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:10.440]  conspiracy theorist because you don't like it having an opinion is conspiracy
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:14.760]  theory being able to talk is conspiracy theory being informed is conspiracy
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:20.240]  theory as I've said 2 plus 2 equals 4 that is now a conspiracy theory you're
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.600]  not allowed to have any thoughts you just receive what they tell you and
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:27.760]  that's the end of it they're now on the news again saying mercury's good for
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:31.320]  children's brains they don't care everyone knows look at the science it's
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:35.440]  one of the most destructive metals in the brain they don't care now euro
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:41.920]  shaken by debt crisis dollar benefits and this is how they're gonna sell it
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:49.080]  seesaw dollar drops euro drops later euro drops the next dollar drops and they
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:54.160]  go up and down in the gyrations but in the general trend they're going down and
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:59.640]  so we look at the short term and oh hooray the dollar went up a little but
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.040]  overall it's still going down same thing with the euro it's global g20
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:09.080]  concerted currency devaluation a giant inflation tax on all of us food
[01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:14.040]  commodities going up food prices and going up kills people in the third
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:20.080]  world it just hurts people in the West approaching 50 million people on food
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:23.640]  stamps the United States that's your modern bread lines you imagine of
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:28.520]  every day there were 50 million people in soup kitchen lines we're in a full
[01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:32.800]  board depression and Geithner we played it yesterday said this is the great
[01:15:32.800 --> 01:15:38.560]  recession so now they're going from we left the recession in June of 2009 and
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:46.840]  now we have entered the the greatest recession and it's gonna be the worst
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:50.920]  thing and that many of us have seen our lifetimes that's the quote so they've
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:55.840]  gone from looting you in the last few phases to now saying yes it's time for
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.520]  sacrifice it's time for depression but don't worry cut all the benefits raise
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.760]  the taxes pay everything to the bankers that they made up out of nothing and
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.040]  things aren't gonna be all right it's gonna get worse but that's just the way
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:14.600]  it is so now they're even dispensing with the lies about hope and change and
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.840]  Obama's gonna maybe a wave of magic pixie wand and fix everything and with
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.240]  this come stage terror attacks to make you love government with this comes new
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.320]  wars they're following a handbook we're entering absolute baglam we're gonna
[01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:33.840]  look back on July of 2011 as a happy time you think things are bad now you
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:37.720]  haven't seen anything yet this is globalism this is the wages of globalism
[01:16:37.720 --> 01:16:43.120]  this is the fruits this is what it does post-industrial world serfdom feudalism
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:47.960]  economic bondage is a tool of control no middle-class the poor plunging into
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.800]  abject poverty let's go ahead and play Geithner on meet the press the
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:57.960]  slithering private Federal Reserve operative in their engage in trillion
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.680]  dollar heist in front of everyone here it is when you think recovery is
[01:17:01.680 --> 01:17:04.240]  actually gonna start feeling like recovery oh I think it's gonna take a
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:07.280]  long time still I think this is a very tough economy and I think for a lot of
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:11.080]  people yeah it's gonna be it's gonna feel very hard harder than anything they
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.800]  experienced a lifetime now for some time to come and that but that is because
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:20.360]  that is the tragic effects of a crisis this deep in this bad caused by a long
[01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:24.560]  period of lost lost opportunities to do things to make the country stronger
[01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:31.480]  oh so and earlier he said raise taxes centralized control because we didn't
[01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:35.480]  have bigger government to siphon the money off we're in trouble now this is a
[01:17:35.480 --> 01:17:41.160]  guy and his predecessor was the former head of Goldman Sachs all these people
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:47.120]  are either Goldman Sachs JP Morgan or their Wells Fargo or their Bank of
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:52.120]  America or Citigroup Citibank that's it they got the Bank of England over in
[01:17:52.120 --> 01:17:57.920]  Europe that's six banks six groups they openly created the 1.5 quadrillion
[01:17:57.920 --> 01:18:01.880]  1,500 trillion they openly got rid of Glass-Steagall they haven't brought it
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:05.640]  back to allow them to do this they openly have gotten we haven't got new
[01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:10.280]  numbers in over a year 27 trillion that's Bloomberg of American taxpayer
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:16.800]  money it was 23.7 trillion two years ago now we don't even know what it is but
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:22.640]  it's trillions a month and they take it and then leverage it into derivatives
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:26.480]  they don't just for every dollar they have in reserve loan out 10 to you at
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:30.720]  interest they loan out unlimited now that's what getting rid of Glass-Steagall
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:35.280]  did but notice now they don't loan it out they only give it to themselves to buy
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:43.360]  up media to buy up defense to buy up water districts roads everything going
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:49.800]  bankrupt into their coffers and the magnitude of this is just unspeakable

[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:33.040]  Tracy Scott John Jonathan Michael and others were going to you Tracy and
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:38.160]  Oregon welcome you're on the air hi first-time caller the first time I tried
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.640]  to call in I got right on we were you were speaking about the system wanting
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:48.560]  it to be violent and I would just like to get it out there about some other
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.480]  research that has been going on about this Jennifer Jones Jennifer J. Jones
[01:26:53.480 --> 01:27:03.080]  arrest and this website well aware one dot com who the host of the site is on
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:07.480]  ma'am ma'am ma'am for those that don't know you're talking about court site it's
[01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:11.440]  all over the international news right now people being arrested for speaking
[01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:16.960]  during citizens communications the the mayor being quote fired by the city
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:21.280]  council which you can't do all sorts of craziness let me just fill in folks what
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.920]  you're talking about specifically cut to the chase Tracy what what's going on
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:31.440]  well maybe that's why the mayor's not in on it because he might be a great mayor
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:37.720]  but there have been staged events and the same actors from the Pima County these
[01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:45.200]  pictures from the Pima County book and from all over have been gathered
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:50.200]  together and these same actors are used over and over again in like the Casey
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:56.760]  Anthony trial and ma'am ma'am ma'am ma'am listen I appreciate your call what's
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:00.360]  happened is people have lost confidence in the system and so they know we're
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:04.120]  being lied to show people aren't sophisticated then they just start making
[01:28:04.120 --> 01:28:09.080]  up whatever they want and saying everything's a conspiracy because now
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:12.520]  they believe nothing and that's the difference between being a true
[01:28:12.520 --> 01:28:17.280]  conspiracy theorist and someone who's informed and that just sounds wild I
[01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:20.320]  don't know what you're talking about I got people that you know that claim I'm
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:24.360]  really Bill Hicks or I'm a reptoid or I'm a Vatican assassin and then that
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.440]  sounds like where we were going and I'm gonna be honest I'm not really a
[01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:32.020]  Vatican assassin I am actually a reptoid let's go ahead and talk to Scott in
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:38.200]  Idaho Scott you're on the air welcome hi Alex he has erected a multitude of new
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:44.200]  offices and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people and eat

[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:53.040]  happening again and what I'd like to tell your listeners today Alex if we
[01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:57.600]  can't think for ourselves if we're unwilling to question authority then
[01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:01.360]  we're just putty in the hands of those in power but if the citizens are
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:07.200]  educated and form their own opinions then those in power work for us in every
[01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:11.320]  country we should be teaching our children the scientific method and the
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:16.560]  reason for a bill of rights with with it comes a certain decency humility and
[01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:22.080]  community spirit in we must teach a love of reality and a love of independence
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.000]  and a love of being honorable and good and a hatred of parasites anything else
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.320]  Scott and the reality is Alex the currently in this country one out of
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:36.920]  every 16 American citizens is incarcerated on probation or parole
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.420]  yeah that's how they're taking our rights is putting us on the criminal

[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:13.000]  family calling for justice and now I've learned it's three three border patrol
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:17.240]  killed with guns connected to fast and furious but in one case but a hundred
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:21.160]  percent proven and finally folks were getting it and then this is coming up
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.200]  but I don't start ranting about it now but I mean this morning without looking
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:33.080]  I heard two different local radio shows going this is wrong why would they ship
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:37.280]  tens of thousands of guns in why would they lie about it why is it coming out
[01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:43.560]  the DEA and FBI's involved and Holder the the Justice Department had the AG has
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:48.200]  been caught lying why and the hosts were like well it they were for the last few
[01:34:48.200 --> 01:34:52.840]  years talking I mean both shows were getting and obviously listening to this
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:57.680]  one or reading our articles but the point is both of the host and in both
[01:34:57.680 --> 01:35:03.400]  instances one was WAI the other kale BJ 590 one of them early in the morning the
[01:35:03.400 --> 01:35:10.560]  other driving in both hosts in both cases were saying well don't you see the
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:14.280]  Attorney General was saying we got to restrict guns even last year because the
[01:35:14.280 --> 01:35:19.160]  violence in Mexico they set this up to blame the second amendment this is
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.120]  criminal they need to go to jail ladies and gentlemen if without looking I ran
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:30.560]  into two shows talking about it today in Texas can you imagine what's going on
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.080]  and they're calling for the arrest of the Attorney General they're talking like
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:41.240]  common sense people normally talk show host or servile cowardly you know they'll
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:46.000]  act tough on little petty issues they pick but they don't call for the arrest
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:51.200]  of Attorney Generals especially one of these local shows I mean it's usually
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:56.640]  just a government worship fest and and they were getting it because it's so
[01:35:56.640 --> 01:36:04.000]  obvious that this is evil evil and of course they knew what was gonna happen
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:10.160]  if I went out and sold guns thousands of them to criminal gangs and and
[01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:13.640]  murders were committed it was found I knew I was selling them to ladies and
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:18.360]  gentlemen I would be brought up on accessory to murder charges that's what
[01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:24.680]  it is accessory to murder and after it came out that I knew they were being
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.360]  used for murders then I could be brought in as accomplice to murder and you can
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.360]  get the death penalty for that oh that's a conspiracy though well they
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:37.920]  millions of people go to prison every year worldwide for conspiracy you get
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:41.640]  together where you work and decide to steal equipment with your body that's a
[01:36:41.640 --> 01:36:47.640]  conspiracy you decide to pull a few little fast ones paying the taxes the
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:52.960]  private fellow reserve they'll charge you with conspiracy but they tell you that
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:57.760]  people in government never are involved in conspiracies on its face you know how
[01:36:57.760 --> 01:37:03.120]  laughable how asinine how ridiculous that is I'm already getting into fast
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.280]  and furious I'm gonna cut I'm gonna cover that more in the next hour we're
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:09.520]  waiting for the mayor to call in and it could be this hour to be next hour with
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:14.040]  the big confrontation in court site and I'm sorry I cut that earlier woman off
[01:37:14.040 --> 01:37:18.960]  because she's like they're using actors in court site and Casey and Casey what's
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:24.440]  Anthony what's it called I mean this is just this total and craziness and
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:28.200]  that's the problem that's gonna happen because when people lose faith in
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:32.320]  everything and learn they've been lied to and they're not sophisticated they're
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.360]  gonna just start thinking everything's a lie and the system plays on they're
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:41.200]  blaming the Constitution capitalism free market on the tyranny no it's because
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:46.240]  we got away from that's why we're going into tyranny their scapegoating freedom
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:49.640]  right now for what's happening they're saying capitalism did this and the very
[01:37:49.640 --> 01:37:54.040]  banksters that engineered the theft are up there demonizing capitalism telling
[01:37:54.040 --> 01:37:57.400]  you they want to raise taxes on the rich and that's somebody making a hundred
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:00.520]  twenty five thousand dollars a year when they've written the tax laws to be
[01:38:00.520 --> 01:38:06.280]  exempt from the taxes I mean they're counting on you so people don't trust
[01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:10.480]  the system anymore but they're still just as confused just as ignorant in some
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:15.040]  cases just as dumb as they were before and it's a process and that's what
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:18.400]  cognitive infiltration is with Cass Sunstein in the White House is they say
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:21.560]  we got to launch thousands of fake conspiracy theorists causing just
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:26.080]  absolute bedlam disinformation false stories and that's what they do and you
[01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.920]  see these sites all they do is in fight all they do is make stuff up all they do
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.760]  is attack people that are telling the truth like myself Ron Paul and others
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:42.160]  and it it's directly out of cognitive infiltration I've experienced it so many
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:46.520]  times ladies and gentlemen all right let's go to your calls John and Texas
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:51.640]  you're on the air thanks for holding welcome hi Alex on the front page of
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:56.280]  Houston Chronicle today it has new rules on border gun sales dealers told
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:00.680]  report buyers of two or more rifles prized by cartels so basically if you
[01:39:00.680 --> 01:39:04.800]  buy any more one rifle then you're gonna be turned into the ATF no no no that was
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.760]  the plan a year and a half ago and and now they're gonna come out with this
[01:39:07.760 --> 01:39:12.120]  executive order to put you on a no buy list no judge no jury extra judicial
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:15.060]  don't know how you got on it that I've been telling you that's gonna be the
[01:39:15.060 --> 01:39:19.360]  plan shutting down the gun shows that's the plan and Obama's talking about an
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:23.120]  executive order what they do here in Austin they send illegal aliens into
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:26.520]  the gun show where people have private sales like you can sell your neighbor a
[01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:30.560]  shotgun or give your grandson one the minority of people in there folks
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:33.280]  decided to sell a few of their guns they usually don't even run a table they
[01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.600]  just walk in with a rifle over their shoulder and that freaks the system out
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:40.400]  the image of people with guns and accidents aren't happening and the guns
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.920]  are out in the open they want to act like it's porn and make you put it in a
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.520]  black bag it's all about perception it's all about theater it's why they
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:52.480]  SWAT team Amish and and and and you know vegetarian or organic stores to then
[01:39:52.480 --> 01:39:56.360]  show the jury the SWAT teaming to make them think well it must be bad what
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:40:00.320]  they're doing and so they say that all over the country I told you last year
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.960]  they're sending the illegal aliens in running these stings it's the Mexico
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:09.120]  collapse scenario that they're gonna use to get our guns I'm sorry go ahead
[01:40:09.120 --> 01:40:12.800]  well all through this article they don't say one thing about fast and furious
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:16.440]  they just say how great this is going to be the target and it stopped the gun
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.360]  traffickers and you know it's extra judicial it's it's it's it first it's
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:27.960]  in California Arizona Nevada New Mexico Texas and they're just doing it see
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:32.800]  that's what Obama said it's extra do judicial Congress didn't pass the law
[01:40:32.800 --> 01:40:38.160]  he just does it and that's a dictatorship they said here they quoted
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:42.240]  President Felipe Calderon he said he claimed in a speech last month in
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:46.840]  California that 85% of the more than eight 100,000 weapons captured from
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:51.480]  gangsters in the past five years came from US gun dealers I blame the North
[01:40:51.480 --> 01:40:54.960]  American weapons industry for thousands of deaths occurring in Mexico
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:59.480]  Calderon said now I blame the drug war and the Pentagon training loss that is
[01:40:59.480 --> 01:41:03.080]  to start this war six years ago that we said at the time was going to happen
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:07.680]  I'm not just saying this now this is key intel that we've got all along the line
[01:41:07.680 --> 01:41:12.480]  and I told people as the North American Union SPP documents said the judicial
[01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:17.160]  watch suit and got that they would use North American drug war crises to bring
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:21.120]  in their North American Union and to bring Mexico under North comm this is
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:25.120]  how they're merging it and yes I have seen the article it's absolutely
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.840]  disgusting yeah actually what Calderon wants he wants Australian style gun
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:34.120]  control where they come in here just complicate everything no I know I know
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:37.400]  in fact I saw that in the Chronicle this morning I saw it last year when they
[01:41:37.400 --> 01:41:41.000]  went when they were going into gun shops and ordering them you know like
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.360]  they're criminals well listen there's no law but you sell more than one gun you
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:48.880]  call us meanwhile all over the Southwest the ATF was setting up operations to
[01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:52.000]  ship the guns out and it turns out giving them directly not just letting
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:42:00.520]  them be sold giving them to the people and now getting cops killed border patrol
[01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:06.360]  killed that's why we've got to in fact give me the headline on that on that
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:09.640]  Houston Chronicle article I'm gonna get that
[01:42:10.400 --> 01:42:16.440]  yeah yeah John give me the headline on that front page headlines new rules on
[01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:21.120]  border gun sales yep new rules on border gun sales that's the same thing we saw
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:26.200]  last year new rules not laws rules Obama says he's got a new rule he can
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:29.340]  attack Libyan it's not a war without congressional approval he's got a new
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:34.200]  rule on the EPA to shut down coal power plants supply 51% of our power but not
[01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:38.960]  his inside buddies he's got a new rule to take your guns he's got a new rule to
[01:42:38.960 --> 01:42:44.760]  enforce health care he's got a new rule on the internet kill switch he's got a
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:52.440]  new rule he's a ruler a death spot a tyrannous anything else John yeah just
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:56.640]  this passive furious deal they really got their hands caught in a rat trap this
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:43:01.440]  proves who really did 9-1-1 who really did Oklahoma City who really put the
[01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:05.320]  underwear bomber on board that plane I mean it's all false flag and this is a
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:09.160]  false flag and they got caught and they ought to not only investigate that
[01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:11.840]  they're free as they need to go back and investigate all this other stuff we've
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:17.280]  been talking about for a long time well John I know why people don't want to
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:19.920]  believe Oklahoma City was an inside job and though it's a hundred percent
[01:43:19.920 --> 01:43:22.840]  privy and we know how they did that and who was involved 9-11 we know the
[01:43:22.840 --> 01:43:26.400]  official stories a lie they stood to gain they've used to take our freedoms
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:31.320]  but we don't know the absolute specifics because they had a fog of war by design
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:34.680]  it was much more sophisticated that's why they did it that way to cover their
[01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:39.720]  trail a little bit better but you said it they admittedly shipped the guns in to
[01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:43.280]  blame our Second Amendment and to destabilize Mexico and to shut down
[01:43:43.280 --> 01:43:47.920]  their drug dealing competition we've caught them and folks I know it's
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:52.680]  scary to admit we have criminals running our government that are terrorist the
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:57.600]  lowest of all but it's a lot more scary to ignore it and let them continue their
[01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:03.840]  plan these people enjoy hurting us they enjoy destroying freedom we don't folks
[01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:09.520]  imagine being me imagine every day doing what I do committing my family
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.080]  everything my life my name being attacked by the globalist publications by the
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:19.440]  ADL Southern Poverty Law Center imagine I this is a commitment this is something
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:24.280]  honorable and courage filled because I love humanity I'm not gonna go along get
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.960]  along keep my head down and if more of us had that attitude we could turn the
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:31.880]  tide against these people but it isn't gonna stay stagnant at one spot it's
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.720]  either gonna get worse or it's gonna get better ladies and gentlemen nothing is
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:40.720]  safe no one is safe they're not just shipping guns into Mexico to blame the
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:46.200]  Second Amendment 11 years ago or 12 years ago and they signed a deal to take
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:50.840]  the life insurance policies of all veterans from World War two through
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.840]  current when they die in a car wreck or cancer or in combat they do a fast one
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:45:00.320]  the government agreed with the insurance companies and steal their money Bank of
[01:45:00.320 --> 01:45:05.040]  America Goldman Sachs JP Morgan have taken thousands of houses on record they
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:10.760]  didn't even have the deed for and never owned no they know it they're crooks they
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:17.080]  know they know they know don't you get it people of course they stage 9 11 of
[01:45:17.080 --> 01:45:20.320]  course they're sticking their hands down your pants it's about breaking your
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:26.280]  will I'm saying else John no that's it I like to keep up the good work I mean
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:30.240]  thank you sir I mean ladies and gentlemen I wish this wasn't true don't
[01:45:30.240 --> 01:45:36.480]  you get it don't you get it they knowingly put cancer viruses and all the
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.240]  major vaccines go search cancer viruses and vaccines and you'll see constant
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:46.720]  articles about oh this deadly cancer-borne virus or a virus that causes cancer was
[01:45:46.720 --> 01:45:51.000]  found in this polio shot it was found in that shot it was I mean they did the
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.760]  CIA was caught with fake inoculations in Pakistan to get DNA if you even believe
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:01.760]  that fallen soldiers families denied cash as insurers profit Bloomberg there
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:08.880]  it is I mean these people met with the government 12 years ago in 99 same time
[01:46:08.880 --> 01:46:13.600]  they got rid of Glass-Steagall they committed themselves to total crime you
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:17.360]  see they have to complete the tyranny because they're all going to prison
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:22.040]  they're they're gonna have to run to third-world countries and hide if we take
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:26.400]  America and Europe and other countries back it's gonna be globalist hunting not
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:31.240]  Nazi hunting it's going to be people with bounties on them from governments
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:36.280]  and private groups hunting them down to bring them to justice they you
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:39.840]  understand we're in a toe-to-toe deathmatch they'd be like being thrown
[01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:44.040]  into an arena in Rome 2,000 years ago and they throw the battle axe down in
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:48.160]  front of you and the door opens and out comes the gladiator okay you're not
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:52.680]  getting out of this by making excuses I'm in the arena you think I like this I
[01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:57.400]  got my family I got free humanity I gotta defend I'm nothing special I'd have
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:01.320]  blind courage not to fight these people in the info war and so the gladiators

[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:19.480]  MSNBC two days ago and he said Saudi Arabia helped to 9-11 hijackers and the
[01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:23.880]  US government helped block the information getting out and the video is
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:30.040]  called on YouTube you can look it up and it's called Saudi Arabia gave assistance
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:37.120]  to at least two of the 9-11 hijackers again it's Saudi Arabia gave assistance

[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:32.920]  distance I know the fires of liberty are getting fired up yeah we found it 9-11
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:36.720]  Commissioner Bob Graham he was the one of the leaders of the Commission here he
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:43.640]  is on national television saying that the Saudis were involved and that the US
[01:54:43.640 --> 01:54:46.920]  government covered it up and really he's already said that before in the
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:50.160]  Washington Post but I told the BBC that while they were here and they would just
[01:54:50.160 --> 01:54:54.120]  laugh I'd say what about the passport surviving and magically being found on
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:58.040]  9-11 of the world and they said oh that's very reasonable and giggled I had
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:01.680]  like black teeth it was like a murk and I was just like you know what this
[01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.720]  interview is done not that you're asking hard questions I'm not gonna sit here
[01:55:04.720 --> 01:55:08.320]  and be giggled at you go have fun with your system and take all your vaccines
[01:55:08.320 --> 01:55:11.720]  and drink lots of sodium fluoride water and he giggled and laughed at that as
[01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:16.000]  well he looked he had somebody with him look like they were quasi-modo I don't
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:20.160]  judge books by covers but you know what I'm done I'm done with you I'm done I'm
[01:55:20.160 --> 01:55:24.560]  not a coward I don't go lick the boots of the system I'm committed you think
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.320]  you're gonna be safe in this system enjoy it all right I'm sorry let's go
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:30.800]  ahead and play the clip that I'm going back to your calls here it is just
[01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:35.720]  briefly Thomas there are some unquestioned facts that Saudi Arabia
[01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:41.200]  was providing significant assistance to at least two of the 19 hijackers living
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:46.200]  in San Diego the questions are why was Saudi Arabia doing this was it also
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.320]  providing assistance to the other 17 hijackers and then why did the United
[01:55:51.320 --> 01:55:56.560]  States go to such lengths including censuring the congressional inquiries
[01:55:56.560 --> 01:56:02.520]  report on the events leading up to 9-11 that related to the role of Saudi Arabia
[01:56:02.520 --> 01:56:06.800]  so there are a lot of unanswered questions and keys to the kingdom starts
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:11.840]  with finding those answers if you say that 40% of what's in that's good we're
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:16.800]  gonna post the whole clip on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com right now but
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:21.000]  in fact Watson's already done an article about it today I did a satire piece
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:25.760]  Alex Jones comes out against 9-11 truth and I actually raised that in the piece
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:29.800]  it's like oh they say it was a lie you know he's there saying why did the US
[01:56:29.800 --> 01:56:34.760]  government cover it up we'll go interview colonel Stephen Butler he came out in
[01:56:34.760 --> 01:56:38.720]  an article in the San Jose Mercury news what a few weeks up 9-11 he said look I
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:42.640]  don't know what's going on but these guys will train right here at the school
[01:56:42.640 --> 01:56:48.040]  I'm the Dean those guys on the news they work for us something's going on here
[01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:59.240]  and they started court-martialing him and so he shut up of course they did it of
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:05.200]  course I mean none of us are safe murdering killers run the country and
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:09.520]  have you coward to them they win a lot of you I talked to a lot of adults and
[01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:15.480]  media people that privately go yeah we know it's an inside job the late Derry
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:22.240]  Brownfield good guy on the Genesis Network died a few months ago privately
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:25.400]  you know I talked to him I talked to his old producer and he's like Alex I just
[01:57:25.400 --> 01:57:28.720]  that wouldn't a big deal but I was like why do you never even come on my show
[01:57:28.720 --> 01:57:35.000]  never have me on yours and he said Alex it's the 9-11 stuff he said some day
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:39.320]  it'll come out and I agree with you and and so did his producer I forget his
[01:57:39.320 --> 01:57:43.520]  name Jeff really nice guy he goes we know those are smart good old boys he'd

[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:19.280]  I would have to be a lunatic moron to know this is an inside job and not
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:22.200]  stand up to speak out against it and that's an American attitude that's a
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:28.320]  human attitude what is this new modern thing where you know what's going on but

[02:01:18.720 --> 02:01:22.680]  under his command he was in a chase aircraft remote pilotings that have
[02:01:22.680 --> 02:01:27.880]  radio link with them when the payload blew up it was a human controlled command
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:31.760]  cruise missile attack system where you fly behind it in a chase plane with a
[02:01:31.760 --> 02:01:40.360]  radio control beacon when the Falk Wolfs came up let's go ahead and talk to Jonathan
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:49.360]  finish up your points my friend yes I have two more things about 9-11 one is
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:55.160]  that Rupert Murdoch is now been accused and his tabloids accused for hacking the
[02:01:55.160 --> 02:02:00.920]  phones of 7-7 victims and 9-11 victims you heard about that that's all over the
[02:02:00.920 --> 02:02:04.760]  news yeah I haven't been covering in the last few weeks because because I've been
[02:02:04.760 --> 02:02:08.840]  researching but I do know what's going on with it and they're burning him it's a
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:12.440]  fight between their camp and the Soros camp and they're trying to bring down
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:17.400]  now the US government saying they're no but investigation on news corps here in
[02:02:17.400 --> 02:02:23.600]  the United States their North American division and that was the scuttle but I
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:29.560]  know Roger Ailes tried to keep back there and there's a big fight over this
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:33.160]  there's a lot of people in the elites who don't like what's happening and don't
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:36.400]  like where this country is going because they realize this system so corrupt
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:41.200]  they're gonna get picked off once the pure dictator ships in place and so this
[02:02:41.200 --> 02:02:44.840]  is just a way to burn Rupert Murdoch tapping phones and spying on people I
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:50.240]  told you industrial espionage all major fortune 500 have huge armies of spies
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:55.720]  hit men everything I mean every major big company out there if it's part of
[02:02:55.720 --> 02:03:00.280]  the globalist till they got hit men that's why what's that movie came out a
[02:03:00.280 --> 02:03:05.600]  few years ago with George Clooney and they admit it's it's it's it's based on
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:12.560]  Monsanto they don't say Monsanto it has another name in it but but the name of
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:18.080]  the movie is the name of the lawyer and you know the Monsanto company has hit
[02:03:18.080 --> 02:03:21.800]  men well I mean that this is the real world they don't just spy on people
[02:03:21.800 --> 02:03:27.120]  folks these major companies have got the entire deal fortune 100 companies are
[02:03:27.120 --> 02:03:31.960]  bigger than most countries GDPs so they've got it all I'm sorry sir go
[02:03:31.960 --> 02:03:39.000]  ahead anything else yes well I also have a request after this but one other
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:44.400]  thing about that is use Murdoch was accused two years ago in 2008 and had a
[02:03:44.400 --> 02:03:50.920]  lawsuit thrown against him from huge he hired hackers to hack his competition
[02:03:50.920 --> 02:03:57.760]  as well that's industrial espionage but anyway the request is is our kid is it
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:03.360]  possible that you can go your show could have a week the week before 9-11 be
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:09.080]  stacked with all the whistleblowers and all that yes I agree with you because
[02:04:09.080 --> 02:04:13.400]  we've won the war of truth on stage terror that's why they're trying to
[02:04:13.400 --> 02:04:17.560]  rewrite history and real a rehabilitate it now it shows all over the world full
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:20.920]  of disinformation it's not gonna work because the fact that they're so
[02:04:20.920 --> 02:04:26.240]  discredited BBC ABC when they come and attack us and 9-11 truth they're so
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:30.680]  discredited people that did weren't even in 9-11 truth go well the liars are
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:35.080]  telling us that it wasn't an inside job but they're so arrogant that they still
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:39.200]  do the pieces they should just keep their mouth shut so it's great they're
[02:04:39.200 --> 02:04:44.880]  coming into our arena Michael Clayton's the name of that movie and boy is it
[02:04:44.880 --> 02:04:51.920]  accurate okay we'll be right back thank you so much great job there Jonathan

[02:05:07.560 --> 02:05:11.560]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:05:11.560 --> 02:05:15.480]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:19.480]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:24.040]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[02:05:24.040 --> 02:05:28.080]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:31.880]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:05:31.880 --> 02:05:35.480]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:05:35.480 --> 02:05:39.840]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:20.880]  yeah the last caller Jonathan wants me to get into news of the world and
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:27.680]  Rupert Murdoch and the Justice Department the folks that ship ends with
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:33.240]  thousands of weapons to drug dealers to kill cops they're going after them for
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:39.400]  espionage economic espionage against competitors hacking 7-7 hacking
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:46.320]  9-11 families to get intel for articles the Rupert Murdoch operation has
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:49.520]  always had a big mafia streak to it and then that's because it works closely
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:53.200]  with the US government and they feel like they can get away with it but right
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:09:00.560]  now he's being spanked but there's industrial espionage across the board
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:07.840]  and it's it's wrong you've got to ask yourself right now why is this coming out
[02:09:07.840 --> 02:09:13.240]  against Rupert Murdoch at this time and that's the larger issue and I've
[02:09:13.240 --> 02:09:16.720]  really collated my thoughts a lot of articles I've meant to cover it I've
[02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:19.720]  covered it some but I meant to get into a real report on it I don't I don't like
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:27.560]  to just to just you know come out and have a half banked breakdown of
[02:09:27.560 --> 02:09:35.120]  something but people who aren't in the media don't understand how the system
[02:09:35.120 --> 02:09:39.440]  is obsessed with it and that's why people you couldn't believe the stuff I've
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:42.880]  been through the type of dirty tricks the weirdness and they're not that bad
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:47.120]  anymore because the systems figured out that I'm not gonna stop and so they try
[02:09:47.120 --> 02:09:50.880]  to assassinate my character in the media but it doesn't matter because so much of
[02:09:50.880 --> 02:09:57.080]  what I cover now is passé I mean so much of staged events lying government
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:01.440]  government shipping guns into Mexico government engaged in corruption
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:05.280]  government stealing pension funds of veterans government stealing houses they
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:09.960]  don't own corporations doing it corporations running government I mean
[02:10:09.960 --> 02:10:15.160]  this stuff's pretty much now just hanging out there in front of everybody and the
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:17.640]  question is what are we going to do about it I want to continue with your
[02:10:17.640 --> 02:10:20.000]  calls and I'm gonna try to hurry through them now because I got a bunch of news I
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:23.360]  want to get to on family of murdered Border Patrol agent considering suing
[02:10:23.360 --> 02:10:29.600]  feds over fast and furious right now let's go to Michael in Texas here on the
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:34.680]  air hey Alex I'm the telecommunications engineer that calls in every once in a
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:41.280]  while up in Plano so let you know Alex its reputation that we get as truthers
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:47.560]  people who understand history we get known as the complainers and we don't
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:52.240]  get labeled as people that are desirous of change or people who understand the
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:56.440]  perspective of history I sit with these Bubba's these good old boys that I work
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:02.440]  with and they say what do you know about Liberty and in the Constitution you
[02:11:02.440 --> 02:11:07.360]  grew up in New Jersey so yeah I grew up on the plane in the orchards where the
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:12.640]  Battle of Mammoth was fought I went to nursery school and sat in pews at old
[02:11:12.640 --> 02:11:17.880]  tenant church where the bloody bodies of revolutionary soldiers and British
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:23.080]  soldiers alike were triaged in a hospital the school I went to was across the
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:26.840]  street from where George Washington's headquarters was when he was near
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:32.280]  Trenton so I understand my Constitution I understand history I understand what
[02:11:32.280 --> 02:11:36.040]  the heck we're standing up for you know let me stop it because this is so key
[02:11:36.040 --> 02:11:39.880]  what you're saying and I want you to continue this is the essence of mind
[02:11:39.880 --> 02:11:45.800]  control and they're all pre-programmed if you go up north and criticize the
[02:11:45.800 --> 02:11:50.520]  government and it's a meme in the media you're a dumb anti-government
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:55.480]  southerner then if you come down to the west or the south or the Midwest and
[02:11:55.480 --> 02:11:59.640]  you're not from around there you getting me from the state over or even the
[02:11:59.640 --> 02:12:03.240]  town over or a different color or a different religion or a different you
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:08.560]  know college degree and they'll look at you and say oh what do you know their
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:13.680]  mind is scared by inside job their mind is scared by corruption their cowards
[02:12:13.680 --> 02:12:20.760]  deep down their lazy people who who want to buy into corruption but because they
[02:12:20.760 --> 02:12:25.240]  don't think highly of themselves and it's because they're smart towards our
[02:12:25.240 --> 02:12:28.920]  well-wrote about this they make a split second calculation what do you know from
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:34.080]  New Jersey get a rope what do you know about George Washington he fought the
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:39.120]  battle of Trenton in Austin Texas not in Trenton New Jersey against the the
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:43.080]  Germans they just I mean if you told them they that was words Washington fought
[02:12:43.080 --> 02:12:47.640]  Germans they'd say where are Germans in the war you know I mean they don't know
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:51.400]  anything and it's the same deal they immediately go to tribalism because you
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:55.680]  scare them that hits the fear area what's in a fear area of a human's
[02:12:55.680 --> 02:13:00.520]  brain when they're talking to other human tribalism I'm scared this human
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:05.240]  just said it he's from another tribe he's from New Jersey and so this is human
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:09.800]  psychology and that's just one slice of how psychology works that you just
[02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:14.080]  described when we're Americans we're humans we you know I talked to media
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:16.840]  executives and folks they go yeah you're huge in the US you're also huge
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:22.120]  worldwide but that isn't too good because you know sponsors they mainly want
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:27.120]  just this market I don't care about that at the end of the day if I can finance
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:30.600]  this operation keep building it it's good to be comfortable so I don't have to
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:34.320]  worry about that financially but at the end of the day I'm risking my life for
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:37.600]  truth because I know there's no future for anybody if we don't beat these
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:41.720]  people I mean these are globalist psychopaths in control of nuclear weapons
[02:13:41.720 --> 02:13:46.520]  genetic warfare systems and they're openly promoting guilds of graduates who
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:49.680]  are who are microbiologists who all they talk about is how they want to kill
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.720]  everybody I mean the acolytes of Professor Bianca UT who wants airborne
[02:13:54.720 --> 02:13:58.960]  Ebola to kill 90% of us as he's ready for his family to die I got attacked by
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:03.760]  some of his acolytes followed their emails found out they were PhDs and
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:08.600]  doctors of biology and here they were saying all humans need to be killed and
[02:14:08.600 --> 02:14:13.000]  then I went and found them in photos and white lab coats at bio weapons labs
[02:14:13.000 --> 02:14:16.760]  smiling as directors I mean they're sending me emails going he's a great
[02:14:16.760 --> 02:14:22.440]  man we need to kill all humans not just 90% I tracked their name back and I mean
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:28.360]  folks red level do you get me made a pure evil has been released from the pit of
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:33.520]  Hades when you let evil take control the worst of society gravitates into
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:37.840]  power it's not that we're all evil and bad it's that the evil gravitates to the
[02:14:37.840 --> 02:14:43.240]  high places because it desires it I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry Michael finish
[02:14:43.240 --> 02:14:48.040]  your point okay no I also wanted to tell you Alex I could get myself thrown out
[02:14:48.040 --> 02:14:53.680]  of this program but I'm in a very special executive MBA program out of UT in
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:57.240]  Dallas it's ranked pretty high in the world I'll just give you the name of it
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:00.880]  it's called glen but listen to the title of this it's called the global
[02:15:00.880 --> 02:15:06.640]  leadership executive MBA program and it's run by a man out of China who's
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.520]  done more mergers and acquisitions than anyone on the planet now I was just I'm
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:16.160]  just in the first semester here you know starting in the summer but you could see
[02:15:16.160 --> 02:15:20.640]  the way that the education I mean they're looking to weed out what they
[02:15:20.640 --> 02:15:25.560]  consider the wheat from the chaff they're trying to find the people early on
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:30.480]  with global at business business ethics classes and things they're trying to find
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:35.840]  out just like they do with the cops and the TSA agents will these people do the
[02:15:35.840 --> 02:15:39.880]  things we want them to do and if they don't they're gonna get a pink slip no
[02:15:39.880 --> 02:15:45.960]  no I've had family I've had family that they grab in college big corporations
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:49.080]  and put through their programs and you wouldn't recognize them they're pro
[02:15:49.080 --> 02:15:54.400]  global government just I mean it's not them anymore it's just that they have
[02:15:54.400 --> 02:15:59.200]  they have been shown this suit of clothes and they say dude you know do you
[02:15:59.200 --> 02:16:03.160]  want money and power put the suit on and they say I'll do it they put that jump
[02:16:03.160 --> 02:16:07.120]  suit on for the New World Order team and they have no idea they have just
[02:16:07.120 --> 02:16:12.840]  shined on literally with Lucifer I'm a descendant of William Wallace I won't
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:18.000]  take that arm that suit of armor I will not wear long shanks colors so let me
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:22.320]  just tell you something else Alex for 15 years I worked for Verizon right
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:25.360]  across the street from police headquarters in Manhattan I'll hold on if
[02:16:25.360 --> 02:16:30.280]  you want because I don't want my name on the you know blasted but you should see
[02:16:30.280 --> 02:16:34.880]  I'm one of your friends on Facebook you've got to see my 9-11 photos one of
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:40.000]  my jobs after 9-11 because we were right around the corner this was our spot
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:45.520]  Alex you'll see pictures of me standing on piles of rubble and you'll see my
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:50.880]  photo that I took of National Guard troops that would not let me in right
[02:16:50.880 --> 02:16:55.440]  at ground zero right at the place where the archable vaults would be why I
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.240]  didn't know at the time but it wasn't because they were trying to protect me
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:03.360]  it's because something was down there they did not want us to see the National
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.960]  Guard troops pointed weapons at me you will see my photos if you want me to
[02:17:07.960 --> 02:17:11.560]  hold on and I'll give you permission I'll sign whatever you want you can use
[02:17:11.560 --> 02:17:16.640]  them I have a video of me walking around downtown Manhattan if you want to use it
[02:17:16.640 --> 02:17:21.720]  a friend of mine the very morning after we walked around down there you've got
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:25.680]  to see this well listen we'll find your Facebook and get it and show it on the
[02:17:25.680 --> 02:17:29.720]  show not today tomorrow link it up at info wars comm imprisonment.com is
[02:17:29.720 --> 02:17:33.520]  well the sites are so important the 90% of stuff we don't get to on air is all
[02:17:33.520 --> 02:17:37.880]  there but but specifically so it was your job being involved in those cable
[02:17:37.880 --> 02:17:43.960]  vaults I mean going over this what are some of the things you saw that are on
[02:17:43.960 --> 02:17:51.800]  these videos well first of all the video started from where our building was at
[02:17:51.800 --> 02:17:59.040]  375 Pearl Street and we had to walk westward across West Broadway and you
[02:17:59.040 --> 02:18:03.760]  know to go over to VZ Street and one of the things that I saw instantly was a
[02:18:03.760 --> 02:18:09.480]  big hole in the side of the building at 140 West Street where 7 came down and
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:14.040]  and punched the hole in the side of the building that was main thing I was concerned with but
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:18.160]  when we designed these cable vaults that were seven stories below ground we
[02:18:18.160 --> 02:18:22.320]  didn't even think a nuclear war could take these things out so when we thought
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:27.040]  oh but you know there's no way that all of these millions of pairs of fiber
[02:18:27.040 --> 02:18:31.480]  optic and copper cable that there's no way they could be destroyed the only
[02:18:31.480 --> 02:18:37.240]  thing that could have destroyed these Alex was explosives there's no way that
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:43.120]  kerosene could melt all of these materials seven stories below ground
[02:18:43.120 --> 02:18:47.720]  the police the police the fireman said it was like a volcano a foundry just
[02:18:47.720 --> 02:18:52.600]  lava everywhere even in areas away from the buildings and it had just been hit
[02:18:52.600 --> 02:18:56.760]  by some super weapon or something and months later it was thousands of
[02:18:56.760 --> 02:19:01.560]  degrees above what normal fires will even burn at it was like Godzilla had
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:06.280]  sprayed fire into there yeah and if you tell people this Alex that's why I tried
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:11.320]  to get on yesterday with Stefan Molyneux. Waking up to this is almost like the
[02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:17.880]  grieving process when your favorite grandpa or friend dies you it's a
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:21.240]  process that's why we need to be patient sometimes with these people yeah
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:25.480]  we're afraid and we want to you know we want to wake these people up but we've
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:29.600]  got to be patient with them because it's a grieving process nobody wants to
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:33.640]  believe that the elite are trying to murder us all nobody wants to believe
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:39.240]  that your best friend died at 9-11 because these murdering scum did it
[02:19:39.240 --> 02:19:44.320]  nobody wants to believe this take me out with your war cry Alex no I can only do
[02:19:44.320 --> 02:19:49.600]  that when I'm this it's upsetting I tell you what Michael we're gonna put you on

[02:25:06.680 --> 02:25:10.040]  city council now that I guess they can do you don't need elections you just fire
[02:25:10.040 --> 02:25:13.800]  the mayor well he went and cancelled their a quote illegal meeting I guess
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:17.920]  it's not following the state laws on that and they went ahead and anyway mayor
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:21.680]  Ed Foster of courtside thanks for joining us sir tell us what happened well
[02:25:21.680 --> 02:25:27.080]  thanks again for having me on again and I appreciate your support and all of
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:33.520]  your listeners but this situation in Arizona is just so similar to what's
[02:25:33.520 --> 02:25:37.120]  going on across this country we have bureaucrats trying to run the government
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:42.600]  they think they're in charge they refused to bow to the elected people that
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:48.040]  they are running rough shot and like in the case of courtside we have a town
[02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:51.600]  council who are puppets for these people you know they think rubber stamp
[02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:56.400]  everything they do it's just unconscionable with but this is true in
[02:25:56.400 --> 02:26:03.000]  all of America right now you know yes sir mayor break down what happened well
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:07.960]  what this morning you know first they had this illegal meeting Sunday and it
[02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:13.000]  violated open meetings law because first it wasn't agendized it wasn't
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:20.040]  announced they called it you know I'm very short notice I refused to attend it
[02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:24.600]  I opened the door to town hall I seen they were having a illegal meeting and I
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:29.600]  said no I'm not coming into this meeting it's illegal and as I said that the
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:33.680]  police officer who was guarding the door pull the door closed and you can see in
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:39.320]  the video that's online clunk and the door was locked so that was the final
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:43.080]  straw public meetings are just that they're open to the public when they
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:47.480]  locked that door there's no other justification at that point for that
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:51.800]  meeting that meeting was illegal the business they conducted behind that
[02:26:51.800 --> 02:26:57.000]  locked door is illegal and therefore the justification for the meeting they
[02:26:57.000 --> 02:27:01.360]  called this morning on short notice I actually got notified I didn't get
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:06.360]  notified officially friends of mine last night came through around 8 p.m. and tell
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.600]  me my god they scheduled a meeting for 10 o'clock and I thought because of the
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:14.400]  emergency or they canceled all meetings in fact they said that but they didn't
[02:27:14.400 --> 02:27:19.080]  bother to tell me there'd be a meeting and I don't think they had such a 10 o'clock
[02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:23.120]  this morning there was going to be such a media circus at their meeting but it
[02:27:23.120 --> 02:27:27.800]  was every television say everybody's covered it but in front of God in the
[02:27:27.800 --> 02:27:31.560]  world when I told him this meeting was illegal to walk out they instructed the
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:35.520]  vice mayor to go ahead and bring the meeting to order and they conducted
[02:27:35.520 --> 02:27:39.760]  business illegally again well they think because they have quote the power of the
[02:27:39.760 --> 02:27:43.600]  office that they're God and it's classic I mean this is something they're
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:46.480]  definitely not going to win in the end mayor this has become a big
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.040]  international story obviously AP reporting on it you name it where is it
[02:27:51.040 --> 02:27:55.160]  going from here I mean if if they're allowed to get away with this will it
[02:27:55.160 --> 02:28:02.360]  become a imperium what you know first off one of the things that supporting this
[02:28:02.360 --> 02:28:07.520]  is this chief of police who at this point in time because the 80% of the
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:12.440]  courtside PD have filed this letter complaining about him alleging a
[02:28:12.440 --> 02:28:17.600]  criminal act and under that circumstance that man should be sitting home in a
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:21.440]  rocking chair waiting for an investigation and as far as I can tell
[02:28:21.440 --> 02:28:26.720]  right now my QPD officers to file that complaint are saying that there's less
[02:28:26.720 --> 02:28:32.120]  than an energetic investigation going on by DPS right now what I'm asking is
[02:28:32.120 --> 02:28:36.440]  that the blisters and the friends of blisters or whatever contact the
[02:28:36.440 --> 02:28:40.880]  governor it's about time this chief of police get a thorough investigation well
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:43.360]  why do you think the state police and others aren't going to want to
[02:28:43.360 --> 02:28:47.520]  investigate because they're run by chiefs that don't want to be investigated
[02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:51.040]  this is the this is what happens in government they all start not
[02:28:51.040 --> 02:28:54.800]  investigating each other so that they can do whatever they want and then that
[02:28:54.800 --> 02:28:58.720]  allows government to get all even more wild and then it just it starts
[02:28:58.720 --> 02:29:04.000]  snowballing downhill well what I'm doing is using this international media
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:09.280]  storm that's out there and I'm asking that we keep the pressure on to the
[02:29:09.280 --> 02:29:14.800]  responsible state authorities to make a real investigation I swear that if this
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:19.000]  chief of police is clear to all these charges these officers that put against
[02:29:19.000 --> 02:29:23.360]  him I will shake his hand and congratulate him but until he is clear to
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:27.720]  wall charges he should not be wearing a badge in the gun he should be sitting at

[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:15.040]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned in
[02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:19.800]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[02:32:19.800 --> 02:32:24.920]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:29.440]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[02:32:29.440 --> 02:32:34.120]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[02:32:34.120 --> 02:32:38.160]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're
[02:32:38.160 --> 02:32:41.840]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the checkout to
[02:32:41.840 --> 02:32:46.640]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have

[02:33:01.080 --> 02:33:13.560]  well the corruption is racing through the body politic right now like a bad
[02:33:13.560 --> 02:33:20.360]  case of Ebola but we're waking up to it and it's gonna be a nasty process but
[02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:25.040]  everything you do every day going to city council going to state houses
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:29.400]  investigating being involved researching how the world really works that's gonna
[02:33:29.400 --> 02:33:33.880]  turn our society around now I want to get to your calls but also have a bunch
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:37.080]  of news we're gonna finish up with the mayor here for a minute or two then I'm
[02:33:37.080 --> 02:33:39.800]  gonna hit some news and I'm gonna go to your calls because I love hearing from
[02:33:39.800 --> 02:33:43.080]  you in the great points at the best callers and listeners in the world a
[02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:48.520]  very important issue though I shot a video on the left right paradigm yesterday
[02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:52.920]  how at the leadership positions of the Republican Democratic parties they're
[02:33:52.920 --> 02:33:57.440]  pretty much on the same team but they toss the political footballs back and
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:34:01.120]  forth while we play monkey in the middle running back and forth and I shot
[02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:06.640]  footage of my French bulldog running back and forth you know symbolizing the
[02:34:06.640 --> 02:34:10.520]  voters and that's up at prison planet calm at the bottom of the page and why
[02:34:10.520 --> 02:34:17.240]  it's a big scandal now I'm an animal abuser I docked the dogs tail and ears
[02:34:17.240 --> 02:34:21.680]  course the people making these accusations can't focus in on the
[02:34:21.680 --> 02:34:25.040]  political issues I'm covering and they don't know that French bulldogs that
[02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:30.280]  naturally have bat ears and have short tails and they don't trim the ears of
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:33.600]  the tails and I wouldn't do that to my dog but see we've been trained to
[02:34:33.600 --> 02:34:37.280]  obsess over petty things and it won't matter that'll be a new conspiracy theory
[02:34:37.280 --> 02:34:43.720]  okay fine in fact we did trim his ears until of course we didn't but hey that
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:46.560]  makes you feel good we did okay in fact put the evil dog back up on screen for
[02:34:46.560 --> 02:34:50.560]  folks if you can there because I know we got all these serious issues to cover
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:54.680]  there he is the French bulldog captain the control left right paradigm for
[02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:59.120]  dummies but by talking about this like I connect like a wounded bird actually
[02:34:59.120 --> 02:35:02.760]  like I'm trying to get you away from the nest oh my gosh I've been caught I've
[02:35:02.760 --> 02:35:05.960]  been caught that'll just make hundreds of thousands people watch the video now
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:09.880]  because I've made a scandal out of it so again no weapon formed against us will
[02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:14.560]  prosper okay now there's a whole conspiracy I will start there'll be
[02:35:14.560 --> 02:35:19.000]  endless discussions and forums about you know is the tail docked on the dog
[02:35:19.000 --> 02:35:23.680]  because people don't believe anything anymore that's the okay now I'm ranting
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:29.720]  going back to mayor Ed Foster of court site mayor so where does it go from here
[02:35:29.720 --> 02:35:34.320]  I mean the mystery paychecks can't find out where those are going can't have
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:38.000]  investigations I mean did you say to them when you got there you can't fire the
[02:35:38.000 --> 02:35:43.480]  mayor I mean are are they gonna nullify other elections what's happening I
[02:35:43.480 --> 02:35:48.200]  didn't tell me such thing I don't acknowledge that there their their law
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:52.060]  was illegal that they put the town manager in the town chief of police in
[02:35:52.060 --> 02:35:56.480]  charge that's the illegal law I was fear to acknowledge that I still perform my
[02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:01.280]  duty as this mayor and I'm going to continue to do that if they wanted to
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:05.520]  do this and they could they could call a regular meeting and they could rubber
[02:36:05.520 --> 02:36:09.640]  stamp the law change because that's the way they do it but at least it would be
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:14.080]  done as a legal meeting with the citizens of court citing the attendance
[02:36:14.080 --> 02:36:17.960]  and I'm sure that the meeting would break down in pandemonium like it did
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:22.320]  today because the people are obsessed with what they're doing the people of
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:26.560]  really woke up here in court site and they're jumping up and down at them the
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:30.960]  people I mean who needs a mayor wait wait wait mayor who needs a mayor who
[02:36:30.960 --> 02:36:35.760]  needs who needs the people the 3600 of the town you got a town manager and a
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:39.520]  police chief now in fact all over the world the globalists trying to get rid
[02:36:39.520 --> 02:36:42.880]  of local elected government and go to corporate government what's wrong with
[02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:48.960]  that you know mayor is just the title Alex it's just the title what I am is a
[02:36:48.960 --> 02:36:53.400]  spokesperson for the people of court site and every elected official should
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.440]  wake up and understand that they should do their job for the people who put them
[02:36:57.440 --> 02:37:02.440]  there not for these bureaucrats you know these bear these cops of people have
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:07.560]  completely lost track of that they are a rubber stamp for the Alex Tafton the
[02:37:07.560 --> 02:37:11.680]  chief Gilbert person they just don't listen to the people out in the
[02:37:11.680 --> 02:37:17.280]  community well or they do they have a few single fence that hang around them
[02:37:17.280 --> 02:37:21.840]  and oh boy yeah you're doing the right thing and those people they say that
[02:37:21.840 --> 02:37:25.520]  until all of a sudden they do something to the police chief or the building
[02:37:25.520 --> 02:37:30.120]  official or the tax collector show up at their doorstep oh I'm a friend Mike how
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:36.280]  could you do that to me you know well they love they love being drug around by
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:41.000]  the by their pimps mayor will continue to watch this as it develops from court
[02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:44.520]  site thank you for spending time with us sir well thank you for putting a
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:49.840]  spotlight on these cockroaches you bet sir God bless all right watching thank
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:52.960]  you sir we're watching that microcosm of what's happening the rest of the
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:37:58.560]  country and the world all right let me I meant to spend more time on this today
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:02.360]  because it's so big but I'll have to cover it tomorrow because I just can't
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:06.400]  do justice to it now obviously Ron Paul's announced he's not going to seek
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:11.720]  reelection for the House of Representatives it's all or nothing he's
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:14.000]  going to totally commit to the presidential campaign and then whatever
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:18.720]  happens he's either going to the White House or he's going to Texas job well
[02:38:18.720 --> 02:38:22.080]  done Ron Paul either way and the campaign's just getting started so this
[02:38:22.080 --> 02:38:31.800]  is his big hurrah governor Paul oh I guess there was some talk about him
[02:38:31.800 --> 02:38:35.680]  running for governor but he kind of giggled and laughed that off yeah he
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:39.640]  could not run and if he lost the presidency become governor Paul that'd
[02:38:39.640 --> 02:38:44.680]  be nice I'd really I would really be proud of that and then he probably moved
[02:38:44.680 --> 02:38:48.520]  back into the governor's man should not hide up in Westlake like pointy boots
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:54.520]  does Al Gore's former chief of staff campaign manager because he's so
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:59.720]  conservative Michelle Bachman IRS tax enforcer oh I'm sorry I shouldn't talk
[02:38:59.720 --> 02:39:04.240]  bad about them they're all Al Gore's a good guy he likes Mitt Romney Mitt Romney's
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:08.280]  good as well right no obama care that's the model for he wrote it Massachusetts
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:11.800]  I mean I shouldn't be so informed it's kind of creepy that we know what we're
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:19.600]  talking about isn't it this is a really serious issue I'm gonna get to that in
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:25.000]  a moment I do want to tell listeners in the info war that people are ready to
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:29.040]  be awakened like never before and I've got a special running in the month of

[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:49.440]  888-253-3139 people ask well what do I do what I do on my own I've pointed out
[02:41:49.440 --> 02:41:53.080]  for years how did I start out access TV small town you'll reach hundreds not
[02:41:53.080 --> 02:41:56.400]  thousands you know there's New York Post gay porn star services mobiles of
[02:41:56.400 --> 02:42:03.040]  Bohemian Grove Chad Savage but continuing here by the way I was a lot
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:10.200]  better looking 11 years ago in 2000 when I snuck in and and I didn't know enough
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:13.520]  about Bohemian Grove to understand why I was being laughed at by the Greenskeepers
[02:42:13.520 --> 02:42:18.360]  and why old men were whistling at us and Vanity Fair wrote about that two years
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:23.160]  ago when the reporter got arrested and so the old men were quite friendly they
[02:42:23.160 --> 02:42:29.440]  were Mike Hansen in bad look and they were running after him and like Peppie
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:34.480]  Lapue I mean I would describe it we were both the cat and we were and it was it
[02:42:34.480 --> 02:42:38.880]  was being whistled at and things and I figured out real quick that that's why
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:42.440]  we were able to infiltrate because we didn't look really old like they do we
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:46.480]  looked young and it was a bad news but if you want to find out about what's
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:57.720]  going on there you can call 888-25-33139 and get the films okay man look
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:01.720]  here's the problem most talk show hosts struggle that's all they do is take calls
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:04.680]  and kind of hype things for one or two minutes when they come back live and then
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:08.640]  they lean on the ropes of the callers of the guests not me I go ten hours and you
[02:43:08.640 --> 02:43:13.760]  know it the problem is is that I cover all this news and then I look at it
[02:43:13.760 --> 02:43:20.840]  again and it's a lot of times I see it kind of like something that's already
[02:43:20.840 --> 02:43:25.000]  been vomited out you know I don't go back to it it's very painful when I
[02:43:25.000 --> 02:43:27.640]  think about how evil these people are and I understand that's why some of you
[02:43:27.640 --> 02:43:34.840]  don't want to face it but here's a Fox News also have Long Island press family
[02:43:34.840 --> 02:43:38.440]  of murdered Border Patrol agent considering suing feds over fast and
[02:43:38.440 --> 02:43:43.240]  furious and I'm not suing a holder himself and the head of the ATF
[02:43:43.240 --> 02:43:47.320]  shipping and tens of thousands of guns knowingly into Mexico so they can
[02:43:47.320 --> 02:43:52.560]  destabilize Mexico kill the drug cartels they don't control and come after the
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:56.520]  second amendment and the good news is the cats out of the bag folks are now
[02:43:56.520 --> 02:44:01.440]  understanding how government operates I mean this is the tip of the iceberg if
[02:44:01.440 --> 02:44:06.320]  the evidence shows Brian's death was approximately caused by the negligence of
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:11.080]  the federal government there will be a case of action said Terry family
[02:44:11.080 --> 02:44:16.520]  attorney Paul Charlton Terry was killed in December of 2010 at the hands of
[02:44:16.520 --> 02:44:21.160]  illegal immigrant worker and working for a cartel and patrolling an area near
[02:44:21.160 --> 02:44:27.880]  Tucson known as Rio Rico and there's two others reportedly killed by these guns
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:33.440]  border patrol agents and that's how they roll so the ATF even the time when he
[02:44:33.440 --> 02:44:37.400]  got killed paraded around and so we got it you got to turn your guns into us we
[02:44:37.400 --> 02:44:41.800]  got to ban your semi-autos you know we got to ban your dear rifles because
[02:44:41.800 --> 02:44:46.400]  because officers are being killed yeah yeah because you're giving the guys the
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:49.640]  drug dealers to kill them and you made the drugs illegal to begin with and put
[02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:53.240]  all the money into it so there would be criminals out there ready to kill because
[02:44:53.240 --> 02:44:57.360]  there's so many millions involved I mean you guys wrote the whole story it's
[02:44:57.360 --> 02:45:01.320]  meant to take our freedoms and pack the presents and let me tell you something
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:05.640]  if I heard two talk shows this morning without even surfing many channels
[02:45:05.640 --> 02:45:09.720]  talking about how the government's criminal and stage this to get our guns
[02:45:09.720 --> 02:45:16.200]  one of them kind of a cupcake liberal one guy's liberal one's conservative
[02:45:16.200 --> 02:45:19.680]  talk show host and both of them were agreeing this was staged to get our
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:23.240]  guns because it's admitted and they're calling for criminal indictments
[02:45:23.240 --> 02:45:28.840]  against the scumbags in government what else are you supposed to do and so there
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:33.600]  you have it oh they'd ship 30,000 guns down there but they wouldn't they wouldn't
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:36.480]  stage the Gulf of Tonkin oh they admit they stage the Gulf of Tonkin to get us
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:40.720]  into Vietnam and all the other things they've staged all the other things they
[02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:44.640]  do you know during the break I saw Obama a medal ceremony giving troops
[02:45:44.640 --> 02:45:49.560]  medals and he does this all the time you see the solemn warriors the primitive
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:53.480]  psychology of our tribesmen the protector of the tribe the people that keep us
[02:45:53.480 --> 02:45:57.160]  from being taken slaves by the neighboring tribe you have this instinctive
[02:45:57.160 --> 02:46:02.800]  love of the of the warriors and there's Obama always with them soaking up their
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:09.200]  their gleam into himself I mean it's it's all just scripted trash and there he
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:13.440]  is continuing and accelerating the stealing of the death benefits of the
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:18.960]  troops on record and Bush was involved Clinton was involved they don't care in
[02:46:18.960 --> 02:46:25.280]  fact they like hurting you see sociopaths and then psychopaths and
[02:46:25.280 --> 02:46:32.960]  sadomasochistic psychopaths they enjoy their work they in that's why they want power so
[02:46:32.960 --> 02:46:37.880]  they can enjoy their work and not get in trouble and it's a process in tyranny of
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:44.360]  them recruiting folks that have a like-minded dalliance and that's what
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:48.600]  tyranny is that's why it's so horrible and why it gets worse and worse and worse
[02:46:48.600 --> 02:46:51.680]  and then none of them can ever allow prosecutions of any of the other
[02:46:51.680 --> 02:46:56.000]  criminals because it sets a bad precedent where they might get in trouble and so
[02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:01.520]  they say hey it's wide open rob everybody and then people in Russia and
[02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:04.840]  third world countries and every other case in history and more primitive times
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:09.920]  stops producing people stop caring they become lazy you get passive aggressive
[02:47:09.920 --> 02:47:14.560]  societies of just kind of jellyfish people when there's real freedom and
[02:47:14.560 --> 02:47:18.000]  you've got a chance to work and keep what you produce and to be honored by it
[02:47:18.000 --> 02:47:24.120]  and truth is honored and people don't put up with corruption I mean folks 150
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:29.320]  years ago if you smarted off to somebody they weren't just gonna get in a fist
[02:47:29.320 --> 02:47:32.480]  fight with you even if you were a lot bigger than them that it wasn't even an
[02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:36.320]  honor issue that's what they did you were gonna be in a fist fight and if you
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:40.800]  wanted satisfaction you go out the street with guns and walk 20 paces and
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:47.120]  shoot each other think and that's so alien so so caveman to us now that's
[02:47:47.120 --> 02:47:52.040]  what you have to be like people were very polite there's a reason Southerners
[02:47:52.040 --> 02:47:56.120]  are on average known for being so polite because it was the last place that
[02:47:56.120 --> 02:48:00.480]  duals and all that were phased down kind of stylized by the guys in the you know
[02:48:00.480 --> 02:48:04.120]  in the town square in the 1870s or whatever out west before they started
[02:48:04.120 --> 02:48:08.840]  outlawing duals but the point is there was real freedom and so that's why that
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:14.480]  that is the American culture I mean ladies and gentlemen there's a reason
[02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:18.720]  mafia always praise on people on minority groups that quote come from
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:22.760]  third-world countries where they've been accustomed to corruption because in
[02:48:22.760 --> 02:48:27.080]  even modern times I mean I'll guarantee you if you pulled up to the average
[02:48:27.080 --> 02:48:32.080]  ranch and got out and you were the mafia whatever group you were sort of
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:35.680]  threatening a rancher they would just kill you and they don't care if you send
[02:48:35.680 --> 02:48:39.760]  more hit men later fine they're gonna die they would just kill you they would
[02:48:39.760 --> 02:48:43.640]  kill you and that's why we have freedom because oh you're trying to enslave me
[02:48:43.640 --> 02:48:49.040]  I'm gonna kill you but we've been trained that when government mafia comes or or
[02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:52.320]  or Bank of America comes to take the house they don't even have a deed for
[02:48:52.320 --> 02:48:57.240]  and you're not even behind in payments or you own it outright well the cops do
[02:48:57.240 --> 02:49:01.400]  what the banker says and then what the corrupt court says and you go out and
[02:49:01.400 --> 02:49:06.160]  let the mafia take you over but they've done the psychological actuaries and
[02:49:06.160 --> 02:49:10.400]  they know that you're gonna start resisting they know those old impulses
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:15.200]  of freedom are gonna emerge that the veneer of civilization is burning off
[02:49:15.200 --> 02:49:20.080]  like a thin layer of paint down to the stainless steel beneath it and that
[02:49:20.080 --> 02:49:26.120]  machine of human dynamic freedom that refuses to submit to tyranny liberty or
[02:49:26.120 --> 02:49:30.400]  death what does that mean what does liberty or death mean it means I will
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:36.000]  not live as a slave it means I'm coming on straight on I'm not backing off you
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.760]  want to play chicken fine liberty or death I don't care don't turn off the
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:44.360]  road I'm going all the way into you liberty or death liberty or death
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:50.680]  liberty liberty or death freedom or death I'm coming I'm coming I'm not
[02:49:50.680 --> 02:49:55.440]  stopping I'm not backing off I'm committed if there's no debate there's no
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:03.200]  discussion it's over liberty or death as for you I know not what choice others
[02:50:03.200 --> 02:50:09.720]  may make but as for me give me liberty or give me death and these were people
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:15.040]  going up against the greatest empire the world had ever seen that huge giant
[02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:20.680]  continental armies couldn't defeat in a seven-year war they had to bring
[02:50:20.680 --> 02:50:25.440]  mercenaries over and they lost almost every battle but they didn't give up
[02:50:25.440 --> 02:50:31.520]  they wore out the enemy they said liberty or death they committed they
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:35.600]  come it's a good feeling it's an empowering feeling it's what life's all
[02:50:35.600 --> 02:50:42.040]  about it's about committing committing it's about saying all my chips are in my

[02:54:24.760 --> 02:54:29.520]  all right we're back live ladies and gentlemen this is a prehistoric spearhead
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:35.920]  I found out about the lake and you know why did humans have this well to protect
[02:54:35.920 --> 02:54:40.000]  themselves to hunt but there were always other tribes and different groups
[02:54:40.000 --> 02:54:46.840]  even of the same genetic sequencing you know same quote race same human
[02:54:46.840 --> 02:54:52.000]  variety would have certain styles some were known as being evil some as brutal
[02:54:52.000 --> 02:54:58.600]  some as warlike some as peaceful it's however those subcultures developed but
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:03.880]  all of them would defend their families or they would be enslaved and generally
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:09.200]  the men in every culture would be killed and the boys girls and women hold off to
[02:55:09.200 --> 02:55:14.920]  make that tribe bigger and we need to recognize the eternal struggle between
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:25.760]  liberty and corruption freedom and slavery it's really that simple and I
[02:55:25.760 --> 02:55:29.920]  just want to encourage everybody to realize as I've said over and over again
[02:55:29.920 --> 02:55:38.440]  what a huge crossroads we're at I mean I look at all of this news that I've got
[02:55:38.440 --> 02:55:44.400]  today and it's just all so transparent this is why they want you this is why
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:47.880]  the banksters want to take part of your paycheck and then pay part of it back to
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:52.120]  you later they want you dependent or they even want to steal your private
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:56.480]  pension funds they want you dependent that's the name of the game Obama says
[02:55:56.480 --> 02:56:00.160]  you cannot guarantee social security checks will go out August 3rd this is out
[02:56:00.160 --> 02:56:06.400]  of a CBS news and this is the type of fear mongering he's engaged in he's
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:11.840]  saying you will and of course they know full well the fellow reserve could
[02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:17.400]  just to issue all of this but it's about controlling the economy it's about
[02:56:17.400 --> 02:56:21.360]  training us to cut back on the economy to raise taxes and to pay more to the
[02:56:21.360 --> 02:56:24.960]  banksters and it's just so incredibly transparent and we're going into a
[02:56:24.960 --> 02:56:28.920]  depression and they're hyper inflating the currency they're down that road so
[02:56:28.920 --> 02:56:33.040]  won't matter of your social security check it's not gonna buy what you need and
[02:56:33.040 --> 02:56:39.280]  so more people will go on welfare more people will go on food stamps not just
[02:56:39.280 --> 02:56:44.960]  the fifty million now and now Geithner admits we're in a depression he calls
[02:56:44.960 --> 02:56:48.320]  it the greatest or the great recession and then it's gonna be the worst thing

[02:59:57.400 --> 03:00:13.480]  Broadcasting Network. We are back live now in to overdrive just for five
[03:00:13.480 --> 03:00:18.040]  minutes because I want to get to more your calls. John in Houston you're on the
[03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:25.560]  air sir welcome. Hello Alex. Yes sir. Several points I'd like to bring up real
[03:00:25.560 --> 03:00:31.600]  quick if I may. One has to do with Einstein's EPR paradox. Are you
[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:37.040]  familiar that that's tied into your spidey sense? Well I mean they've done a
[03:00:37.040 --> 03:00:40.080]  lot of studies that everybody's got a sixth sense it's just how attuned is it
[03:00:40.080 --> 03:00:45.200]  but please continue. Well Einstein proved that faster than light
[03:00:45.200 --> 03:00:49.160]  communication exists and this experiment has been duplicated many times but the
[03:00:49.160 --> 03:00:55.400]  most exciting part about this is there's a way for us to bump that up and one
[03:00:55.400 --> 03:00:59.800]  reason why it's so hard to wake so many people up is because their spidey sense
[03:00:59.800 --> 03:01:06.320]  is so is just too low but there's a natural way to bump this up and it's
[03:01:06.320 --> 03:01:09.240]  on the cutting edge there are 40 scientific organizations studying this
[03:01:09.240 --> 03:01:12.840]  in Germany right now and I'd like to talk to you a whole lot more about that
[03:01:12.840 --> 03:01:17.720]  offline if I could. Other things I want to bring up real quick is something that
[03:01:17.720 --> 03:01:21.700]  I think of every time I hear you talk is book 3 chapter 7 in
[03:01:21.700 --> 03:01:27.000]  Aristotle's rhetoric and if you haven't read that real short chapter it's only
[03:01:27.000 --> 03:01:30.760]  about three paragraphs long I guarantee you Alex when you read it it will put
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:36.320]  the biggest smile on your face because you'll it would just confirm what you're
[03:01:36.320 --> 03:01:40.400]  doing is right. Well I've read some Aristotle but I haven't read it in
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:47.280]  decades. Somebody email me that particular chapter what is it again? Book 3
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:54.080]  chapter 7 in Aristotle's rhetoric and then another book that
[03:01:54.080 --> 03:01:59.600]  Aristotle wrote on ethics he talked about how ethical knowledge was not
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:02.800]  didn't have anything to do with precise knowledge didn't have anything to do with
[03:02:02.800 --> 03:02:07.120]  logic and mathematics but had to do with general knowledge and this ties into the
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:12.760]  spidey sense so the color you had on last week you know I guess I have to say
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:16.680]  this the people rule in the world the globalists there you know they're
[03:02:16.680 --> 03:02:20.480]  con artists they're masters of illusion and they're misdirecting all of our
[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:25.120]  experts they're misdirecting our medical doctors. Yeah they create false
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:30.000]  constructs that are limited paradigm and then shut everyone into those great
[03:02:30.000 --> 03:02:33.040]  great points John I'm gonna jump into Debbie I wish I get to everybody else
[03:02:33.040 --> 03:02:38.600]  Debbie in New Jersey are on the air go ahead. Hello. Yes Debbie welcome. Hi. Hi thank you.
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:42.880]  I also want to thank Mayor Forster for what he is doing and the people who
[03:02:42.880 --> 03:02:46.640]  stand to support and try to speak out and get arrested or thrown out the
[03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:53.280]  meetings I know what that's like we have that happen here frequently. I do a bond
[03:02:53.280 --> 03:02:59.440]  presentation one thing I really would like people to do is find out what
[03:02:59.440 --> 03:03:05.720]  their town's debt is. Hello hello. Yes. Okay ma'am you're on air I promise you.
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:11.240]  Okay I can't hear when you find out what your bond debt is and this is going to
[03:03:11.240 --> 03:03:18.360]  the bankers it's going to the insurance companies it's going to central group of
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:23.360]  solicitors and they are constantly refinancing which they call refunding
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:27.680]  which keeps the people into servitude. Well yeah no absolutely they have a
[03:03:27.680 --> 03:03:30.920]  double set of books they have the budget that's a small part of it they then
[03:03:30.920 --> 03:03:34.600]  siphon everything else off into the comprehensive annual financial report
[03:03:34.600 --> 03:03:40.320]  system and it all goes into Goldman Sachs JP Morgan they then when you go bank
[03:03:40.320 --> 03:03:45.240]  rubbed they then make the calls for unemployment they're the operators they
[03:03:45.240 --> 03:03:49.400]  control an issue the cards for the food stamps they run are all it's it's a it's
[03:03:49.400 --> 03:03:55.000]  a meat grinder. It's a big scam and what people need to do is wake up to it and
[03:03:55.000 --> 03:03:58.600]  when they see what the debt is that they have in their own town we need to
[03:03:58.600 --> 03:04:02.600]  repudiate it and just stick it back to the people that have been sticking it to
[03:04:02.600 --> 03:04:09.640]  us. I also go into showing how to find Agenda 21 smart growth. Well that's
[03:04:09.640 --> 03:04:14.360]  awesome do you have a website or something ma'am? Yes I do and I'd be happy it's
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:19.280]  it's being uploaded it's called MantuaRepublicans.com and there is an
