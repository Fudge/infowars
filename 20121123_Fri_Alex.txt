[01:52.320 --> 01:57.000]  have committed to never coming on the Alex show unless I bring a piece of
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.640]  comedy with me so today I've got a poem for you called TSA Santa and the night
[02:02.640 --> 02:08.840]  before Christmas and TSA Santa unlike regular Santa TSA Santa sneaks down
[02:08.840 --> 02:12.600]  your chimney and steals all your electronics and then auctions them on
[02:12.600 --> 02:18.320]  eBay so I'll have that poem coming up for you along with some illustrations too
[02:18.320 --> 02:23.720]  for those of you watching on Prism Planet TV now in addition to that we've
[02:23.720 --> 02:28.160]  got news on the economic IQ test you know this big discussion coming up now
[02:28.160 --> 02:33.680]  about the fiscal cliff we're going to fall off the fiscal cliff unless we go
[02:33.680 --> 02:37.280]  deeper into debt that's the message that we're all being told by both
[02:37.280 --> 02:43.040]  Republicans and Democrats and Timothy Geithner says hey let's get rid of the
[02:43.040 --> 02:47.560]  debt ceiling all together and have infinite debt yeah that's Geithner's
[02:47.560 --> 02:52.320]  approach so we're going to talk about that we've got news about a human rights
[02:52.320 --> 02:57.880]  group warning about the coming robotic war crimes against humans the
[02:57.880 --> 03:02.560]  Terminator could become a reality if we don't change the direction we're going
[03:02.560 --> 03:08.640]  we've also got what is this news from info wars.com a Paul Joseph Watson
[03:08.640 --> 03:14.760]  article about armed drones to patrol the highways by 2025 yeah imagine that
[03:14.760 --> 03:18.880]  instead of a cop pulling you over a drone pulls you over in fact the drones
[03:18.880 --> 03:23.880]  are going to be equipped with weapons that can blast your vehicle with an
[03:23.880 --> 03:29.600]  electromagnetic pulse to disable all your vehicle electronics won't that be
[03:29.600 --> 03:34.680]  wonderful another way to enforce the police state now we've also got think
[03:34.680 --> 03:40.160]  about this here in Texas we had a big pile up on the highway yesterday a hundred
[03:40.160 --> 03:45.840]  vehicles involved in this massive crash involving fog now that as sad as it was
[03:45.840 --> 03:50.160]  there were some fatalities and a lot of injuries it's also a metaphor for the
[03:50.160 --> 03:55.600]  economic crash that's coming and the fog the economic fog into which we are
[03:55.600 --> 04:00.160]  driving right now as a nation so in the next segment I'm going to explain that
[04:00.160 --> 04:05.440]  and why we need to put on the brakes on debt spending otherwise we're going to
[04:05.440 --> 04:11.040]  have a national pile up an economic train wreck involving not just a hundred
[04:11.040 --> 04:16.360]  cars but 300 plus million people that's what's coming so watch for that or
[04:16.360 --> 04:19.440]  listen for that here in the next segment also we're going to have some
[04:19.440 --> 04:24.120]  comments today about the secession of the state of Texas that's been a hot
[04:24.120 --> 04:27.800]  topic in the last week Alex has covered it here on the show with other guests

[08:53.080 --> 08:58.440]  every year and there been some reports of some you know craziness happening last
[08:58.440 --> 09:02.200]  night and early this morning you know just driving around last night I saw
[09:02.200 --> 09:08.240]  people camping out at best buy at like 6 p.m. yesterday starting to camp out there
[09:08.240 --> 09:13.640]  and I'm thinking you know what does this culture come to when that is the most
[09:13.640 --> 09:18.920]  important thing for people to camp out in in front of the best buy to save what
[09:18.920 --> 09:23.400]  I don't know a couple hundred bucks off of a flat panel display why aren't these
[09:23.400 --> 09:28.280]  people camping out in front of the wine house and demanding liberty for the
[09:28.280 --> 09:32.000]  American people you know they're they're they're willing to go camp out to save a
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.840]  little bit of money off some electronics but not to you know defend
[09:36.840 --> 09:41.360]  liberty in America and the Constitution or why aren't we camping out in front of
[09:41.360 --> 09:45.280]  all the airports and blockading the TSA for their violations of the Fourth
[09:45.280 --> 09:49.720]  Amendment and basic human dignity so just goes to show you where the priorities
[09:49.720 --> 09:53.560]  are right now in America but we'll talk about that in more detail also coming up
[09:53.560 --> 09:59.160]  today we've got the TSA Santa a night before Christmas poem that I put
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.120]  together for you will share that with you here in a minute plus a lot of other
[10:02.120 --> 10:06.960]  news on the economy on drones Alex Jones has a special video that he's shooting
[10:06.960 --> 10:11.800]  right now that we're going to play probably in the next hour sort of
[10:11.800 --> 10:15.240]  depending on when that when that comes in and gets ready a lot of breaking news
[10:15.240 --> 10:21.080]  on the economy some comments for you on Texas secession and much more so so here
[10:21.080 --> 10:26.200]  we go thanks for joining me today here on the Alex Jones show on this Friday
[10:26.200 --> 10:30.720]  after Thanksgiving and I hope you had a great Thanksgiving by the way and I do
[10:30.720 --> 10:37.480]  want to say you know just for all of us I want to say how thankful I am and I know
[10:37.480 --> 10:43.480]  I speak for the Info Wars crew that's here today to say and certainly for
[10:43.480 --> 10:49.680]  many of you listening to say how thankful we are to have our free will and to
[10:49.680 --> 10:56.080]  live in a universe created by an intelligent creator that gave us who
[10:56.080 --> 11:00.040]  gave us free will who gave us the ability to make our decisions so that we
[11:00.040 --> 11:05.440]  can discover what kind of character we have what kind of person we are you know
[11:05.440 --> 11:09.640]  imagine if we lived in a world where we didn't have free will and everything was
[11:09.640 --> 11:13.680]  predetermined and it was just like sort of watching a movie from a first-person
[11:13.680 --> 11:18.840]  point of view where you know everything was was fate that wouldn't be
[11:18.840 --> 11:23.000]  interesting that wouldn't be fun it would be like being a prisoner in effect in
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.400]  your own body but we don't live in that universe we live in a universe where we
[11:26.400 --> 11:30.440]  have free will we can make decisions and as a result we are responsible for the
[11:30.440 --> 11:35.160]  the ramifications of those decisions and that's a good thing even though we have
[11:35.160 --> 11:40.040]  to fight a lot of evil and we coexist on this planet with a lot of evil at least
[11:40.040 --> 11:43.440]  we have been given the power to make our decisions so I'm thankful for that
[11:43.440 --> 11:48.960]  above everything else and then in addition of course in a more mundane
[11:48.960 --> 11:53.880]  level I'm thankful for you the listeners and for Info Wars and the entire Info
[11:53.880 --> 11:57.720]  Wars team for Alex Jones and his work and everything else that goes on here
[11:57.720 --> 12:02.280]  that helps bring awareness and liberty to everyone listening so just want to
[12:02.280 --> 12:07.120]  say thank you to all of you and let's let's move right into some of the some
[12:07.120 --> 12:11.840]  of the more fun bits here now I normally I would just start off with with the
[12:11.840 --> 12:14.440]  news and I'll get to those headlines in just a second but I got to share this
[12:14.440 --> 12:22.600]  with you the TSA has become such a cancer on American culture it is it is
[12:22.600 --> 12:32.960]  ruining dignity it is saying that pedophilia is okay it's saying that molesting
[12:32.960 --> 12:38.360]  your your your grandmother is acceptable you know these kinds of things this is
[12:38.360 --> 12:43.040]  what the TSA this is the message that the TSA is sending that you don't even
[12:43.040 --> 12:48.440]  need to take an oath of office to reach down someone's pants these days now all
[12:48.440 --> 12:51.800]  you got to do is take a couple weeks of training as a TSA officer and boom you
[12:51.800 --> 12:56.040]  know there you are suddenly you have federal authority to molest travelers
[12:56.040 --> 13:00.440]  and there's something very deeply wrong with that I know you agree with me on
[13:00.440 --> 13:06.800]  that point but the TSA we've got to make fun of the TSA and I did that a few
[13:06.800 --> 13:11.320]  months ago with that video called TSA help wanted which YouTube immediately
[13:11.320 --> 13:16.480]  blocked and censored because it was about to go viral but I've decided to
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.120]  make fun of the TSA yet again with another bit of comedy because this is
[13:20.120 --> 13:25.560]  this is where this is what they hate the most to make fun of them is the opposite
[13:25.560 --> 13:29.400]  of bowing down and licking their boots bowing down to tyranny to make fun of
[13:29.400 --> 13:34.240]  them is to belittle them in in their actions and in their lack of integrity
[13:34.240 --> 13:37.600]  and that's what we're going to do right here so we've got illustrations for those
[13:37.600 --> 13:42.560]  of you watching a prison plant TV and here's the poem that I put together a
[13:42.560 --> 13:48.000]  couple days ago called TSA Santa and the night before Christmas you ready guys
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.680]  there we go it was the night before Christmas and all through the house not
[13:53.680 --> 13:58.960]  a creature was stirring not even a mouse when along came a thud and a sick
[13:58.960 --> 14:04.920]  sounding oof like some huge man-shaped blob just got dropped on the roof he
[14:04.920 --> 14:09.720]  scrambled and cursed as he fumbled his way to the chimney I know because I heard
[14:09.720 --> 14:15.600]  a voice say this better be good one more house and I'm done then he scaled down
[14:15.600 --> 14:21.120]  the chimney with a pepper spray gun I fled as the monster squeezed out of the
[14:21.120 --> 14:28.160]  shoot it was TSA Santa come to steal all our loot with a sack in one hand like he
[14:28.160 --> 14:33.960]  does with young boys he stole all our iPads and cameras and toys he stripped
[14:33.960 --> 14:39.960]  us of everything and slithered away to prep all the items for sale on eBay TSA
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.720]  Santa loves holiday cheer he can steal much more stuff at this time of the year
[14:44.720 --> 14:49.640]  he crushes your testicles and little boys dreams making good on big
[14:49.640 --> 14:55.400]  government's tyranny schemes if TSA Santa tries to steal all your loot aim
[14:55.400 --> 14:59.800]  your 12 gauge with care and don't blink when you shoot for the world would be
[14:59.800 --> 15:05.040]  better without tyranny and fear we could all enjoy Christmas and a happy new
[15:05.040 --> 15:11.840]  year there you go folks TSA Santa and the night before Christmas a bit of a
[15:11.840 --> 15:16.760]  bit of comedy satire relief for you there hope you enjoyed that all right now
[15:16.760 --> 15:22.000]  we've got coming up next we're going to go to an interesting video about carbon

[16:08.680 --> 16:12.000]  heels of Hurricane Sandy and the reelection of President Barack Obama
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.280]  the Congressional Budget Office this week released a report all about how low
[16:16.280 --> 16:20.800]  income families can now afford a carbon tax conservative and liberal think tanks
[16:20.800 --> 16:25.080]  alike have jumped on the bandwagon hosting all-day panels on the topic and
[16:25.080 --> 16:30.360]  putting out white papers and right on time here comes Al Gore openly calling
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.280]  on President Obama to institute a carbon tax to save us all from the fiscal
[16:34.280 --> 16:39.000]  cliff budget crisis in addition Gore also premiered another 24 hours of
[16:39.000 --> 16:43.720]  reality a dirty weather report across the globe cataclysmic weather events are
[16:43.720 --> 16:48.520]  occurring with such regularity that it's being called a new normal but there's
[16:48.520 --> 16:52.440]  nothing normal about it and there's something else that lies destroyed
[16:52.440 --> 16:57.560]  amid the rubble the truth about climate change where he urges people to go to
[16:57.560 --> 17:02.440]  his climate reality project website to sign up to quote change the world by
[17:02.440 --> 17:06.720]  becoming an Al Gore climate leader educating people on Gore's brand of
[17:06.720 --> 17:11.080]  environmentalism the website actually says climate change is not your fault
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.000]  for the car you drive the lights you turn on or the food you eat the climate
[17:15.000 --> 17:21.040]  crisis is our problem so apparently we can all fix our problem together all we
[17:21.040 --> 17:25.840]  have to do is pay Al Gore carbon taxes now if climate change could be
[17:25.840 --> 17:29.480]  attributed to the lights you turn on as Gore puts it perhaps he would be at the
[17:29.480 --> 17:34.160]  top of the list considering in just one year his mansion used a quarter of a
[17:34.160 --> 17:37.520]  million kilowatt hours amounting in thirty thousand dollars in utility bills
[17:37.520 --> 17:42.120]  utility bills Gore will easily be able to pay if carbon taxes go through as he
[17:42.120 --> 17:48.000]  stands to make billions as info wars has extensively reported man-made global
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.120]  warming is a hoax it's based on shady science that's propagated to institute a
[17:52.120 --> 17:56.840]  one-world government through money-making schemes like cap and trade and carbon
[17:56.840 --> 18:02.280]  taxes maybe Al Gore thinks if he repeats this scare mantra over and over again
[18:02.280 --> 18:07.000]  we'll finally believe it and pay him some carbon taxes now on a side note do
[18:07.000 --> 18:12.320]  you remember the 1990s environmental cartoon Captain Planet in it five youths
[18:12.320 --> 18:16.080]  from all across the globe called planet tears would get together to fight
[18:16.080 --> 18:19.960]  pollution and capitalism and when their powers combined it would summon Earth's
[18:19.960 --> 18:24.200]  greatest champion Captain Planet a magical blue guy with a green mullet who
[18:24.200 --> 18:28.280]  would come in to save the day and tell kids the power is yours when it came to
[18:28.280 --> 18:41.000]  saving the earth you have to wonder was Captain Planet some kind of globalist
[18:41.000 --> 18:45.440]  propaganda programming on a massive scale as the elementary and middle school
[18:45.440 --> 18:48.800]  students who used to come home from school and watch Captain Planet on TV
[18:48.800 --> 18:52.720]  every day or now the adults who turn on the TV every day that tells them that
[18:52.720 --> 18:57.200]  man-made global warming is killing the earth and so is overpopulation and only
[18:57.200 --> 19:01.320]  they can do something to fix it and what's more does Al Gore somehow think
[19:01.320 --> 19:04.960]  he's the real life Captain Planet I mean after all he's swooping in to save the
[19:04.960 --> 19:09.280]  earth with his carbon taxes and the UN even named him champion of the earth in
[19:09.280 --> 19:14.520]  2007 much like Captain Planet is called Earth's greatest champion in addition
[19:14.520 --> 19:18.280]  Gore's website tells us that by uniting our voices we have the power to change
[19:18.280 --> 19:22.600]  the world just like Captain Planet says with your powers combined before he
[19:22.600 --> 19:27.240]  saves the planet and after all yesterday's Captain Planet Planet here
[19:27.240 --> 19:31.440]  want to be's now have the opportunity to become today's Al Gore climate leaders
[19:31.440 --> 19:35.400]  well ladies and gentlemen once again the power is yours to save the earth and
[19:35.400 --> 19:40.240]  according to Al Gore all you have to do is pay him some carbon taxes I'm Melissa

[24:15.760 --> 24:21.760]  All right welcome back folks to the Alex Jones show here at the InfoWars Studio in Austin, Texas.
[24:21.760 --> 24:26.560]  This is Mike Adams the health ranger the editor of naturalnews.com filling in
[24:26.560 --> 24:32.560]  for Alex today who I think is listening in probably enjoying taking a little a
[24:32.560 --> 24:36.040]  little time off with his family I'm really happy that he's able to do that and
[24:36.040 --> 24:40.760]  so here's some of the headlines right now tax increases could factor in MLB
[24:40.760 --> 24:46.880]  negotiations tax increases are coming watch out for the term revenue when it
[24:46.880 --> 24:51.240]  comes to the fiscal cliff negotiations we'll talk about that term and the
[24:51.240 --> 24:55.720]  misuse of that word here in a second. Sandy ravaged New Jersey families face
[24:55.720 --> 25:02.480]  almost $7,000 in tax hikes in the fiscal cliff stalemate and that's interesting
[25:02.480 --> 25:07.240]  because of course New Jersey supported Obama for president so I think the
[25:07.240 --> 25:13.560]  drudge headline says own it own it you you elected this guy president and now
[25:13.560 --> 25:18.400]  you're gonna pay you're gonna pay right out of your bank account Jesse Jackson
[25:18.400 --> 25:26.400]  Jr.'s resignation could cost taxpayers $5.1 million that news is no shock gee
[25:26.400 --> 25:31.240]  really do you bureaucrats waste taxpayer money no no tell me no it never
[25:31.240 --> 25:36.160]  happens surprise Pennsylvania College slashes instructors hours to avoid
[25:36.160 --> 25:41.800]  Obamacare mmm yeah this is gonna happen everywhere folks if you're working a
[25:41.800 --> 25:46.520]  job right now that's 40 hours a week be prepared to have it slashed to 30 hours a
[25:46.520 --> 25:50.200]  week and if you work in 30 hours a week be prepared to have it slashed to 20 hours
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.480]  a week see employers aren't are not going to be able to afford Obamacare we
[25:55.480 --> 25:59.720]  saw what a Denny's restaurant already announcing us an Obamacare surcharge on
[25:59.720 --> 26:04.560]  the receipts on what they charge customers for food and cutting the
[26:04.560 --> 26:08.960]  hours of employees this is going to happen across the economy where you're
[26:08.960 --> 26:15.120]  gonna have to have now three different jobs none of which have health insurance
[26:15.120 --> 26:21.120]  coverage and all of which pay less than the one good job you used to have before
[26:21.120 --> 26:27.080]  Obamacare required employers to pay these ridiculous monopolistic fees to a
[26:27.080 --> 26:32.880]  failed corrupt system of health insurance and disease care that we call
[26:32.880 --> 26:37.080]  modern medicine so instead of solving you know instead of Obamacare actually
[26:37.080 --> 26:42.280]  addressing the causes of disease nutritional deficiencies and GMOs and
[26:42.280 --> 26:46.080]  aspartame and so on instead of doing that all they did is shuffle the money
[26:46.080 --> 26:51.440]  around and create another monopoly and then force employers to well go out of
[26:51.440 --> 26:54.560]  business and that's what we're going to see get ready the next four years are
[26:54.560 --> 27:00.480]  going to be really interesting now here's an article that I posted today I
[27:00.480 --> 27:06.640]  think this is up on info wars.com as well economic IQ test yeah you ready for
[27:06.640 --> 27:11.200]  this test it's time to test your IQ here's the test if the national debt
[27:11.200 --> 27:16.120]  doesn't matter as Timothy Geithner says when he says hey let's just eliminate
[27:16.120 --> 27:20.040]  the debt ceiling we don't need a debt ceiling let's have infinite debt if the
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.680]  national debt doesn't matter folks then why are we still paying federal income
[27:24.680 --> 27:31.720]  taxes huh think about that now really we pay about two point four trillion
[27:31.720 --> 27:37.640]  dollars a year in taxes to the federal government both from personal taxes and
[27:37.640 --> 27:42.720]  corporate taxes well two point four trillion dollars a year comes to about
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.120]  what two hundred billion a month well why can't the federal government just
[27:47.120 --> 27:52.560]  eliminate the IRS eliminate all taxes completely and just have the Fed create
[27:52.560 --> 27:56.320]  another 200 billion a month on top of the 80 billion a month that they're
[27:56.320 --> 28:01.120]  creating right now to buy US Treasury debt through QE unlimited as they
[28:01.120 --> 28:05.840]  called it now I know those of you out there are saying well wait a minute if
[28:05.840 --> 28:09.200]  we do that we're going to debase the currency we're going to devalue the
[28:09.200 --> 28:13.200]  money supply we're going to hyperinflate well we're doing that anyway folks we're
[28:13.200 --> 28:17.680]  doing that anyway so why not have the federal government just create all the
[28:17.680 --> 28:22.760]  tax money you know all the equivalent of all the taxes just create it eliminate
[28:22.760 --> 28:28.440]  all taxes federal taxes let people keep the money let employers keep the money
[28:28.440 --> 28:32.440]  create more jobs have more economic abundance have more savings in our
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.680]  homes and just have the Fed create that money because they did it for the
[28:36.680 --> 28:40.840]  bankers remember when they needed a trillion dollars to bail out the bags
[28:40.840 --> 28:45.320]  they just created the money out of thin air as new debt of course to the federal
[28:45.320 --> 28:49.780]  reserve the private banking corporation federal reserve they just created the
[28:49.780 --> 28:56.120]  money when the wealthy needed it but when they want you to pay them they say
[28:56.120 --> 29:00.480]  oh the government needs revenue we need your tax money to build schools and
[29:00.480 --> 29:06.080]  bridges and roads that is a myth folks that is a total delusion the government
[29:06.080 --> 29:10.160]  doesn't need your money to pay for anything they can create all the money
[29:10.160 --> 29:13.840]  they want because they're doing it anyway so what is the point and this is
[29:13.840 --> 29:18.160]  where the IQ test comes in what is the point of the federal income tax if not
[29:18.160 --> 29:23.840]  to raise revenue it's to control you folks it's to suppress you it's to keep
[29:23.840 --> 29:29.160]  you down to limit your economic mobility so that you can never compete with the
[29:29.160 --> 29:35.040]  ultra-wealthy so that you stay in that little box of economic enslavement from
[29:35.040 --> 29:39.680]  which you can never escape and never stop working that's the point of the
[29:39.680 --> 29:43.800]  federal income tax stay with us a lot more straight straight ahead here on the
[29:43.800 --> 29:47.680]  Alex Jones show will be right back after this break

[33:29.880 --> 33:34.880]  Thanksgiving broadcasting live from Austin Texas the info war studios this
[33:34.880 --> 33:39.360]  is Mike Adams the health ranger editor of natural news filling in for Alex
[33:39.360 --> 33:42.760]  today hope you've enjoyed the show so far we got a lot more coming up for you
[33:42.760 --> 33:47.800]  including a couple of fascinating guests Mike Bundren and Ed group are
[33:47.800 --> 33:50.720]  coming up here on the show we've also got some other video segments for you
[33:50.720 --> 33:54.680]  straight ahead some special reports in fact we got one coming up right now on
[33:54.680 --> 33:59.140]  police well not right now but in a few minutes from David Ortiz info wars
[33:59.140 --> 34:06.320]  reporter on the abuse of citizens by police and that's always I'm not even
[34:06.320 --> 34:12.280]  watch that because I it's it's always sad for me to see that happening because
[34:12.280 --> 34:18.440]  I know so many good cops you know I know I mean you know I used to volunteer for
[34:18.440 --> 34:25.040]  the Tucson Police Foundation in Arizona and we would raise money for cops and
[34:25.040 --> 34:28.560]  and we would you know we would hang out with cops and talk to them about their
[34:28.560 --> 34:32.640]  needs and check out their training facilities and on all these kinds of
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.120]  things I even even trained with some cops and some some DT defensive tactics
[34:38.120 --> 34:42.120]  hand-to-hand combat that kind of thing and you know most of the cops out there
[34:42.120 --> 34:47.200]  are good people they're they're trying to do the right thing but occasionally you
[34:47.200 --> 34:54.480]  get bad cops or in certain cities you have sometimes a dominant culture of
[34:54.480 --> 35:00.120]  evil or abuse that happens in the police and you know historically that's
[35:00.120 --> 35:05.800]  happened in many places as Chicago New York Miami need I I mean if you if you
[35:05.800 --> 35:10.920]  look up bad cops in the encyclopedia it probably says Miami okay that's how bad
[35:10.920 --> 35:15.680]  it is there but lots of other places where it becomes a culture but you know
[35:15.680 --> 35:19.720]  the problem is the lack of accountability and it's the same problem we
[35:19.720 --> 35:24.440]  have at the federal level anytime you have a system of power whether it's
[35:24.440 --> 35:30.440]  police or the Federal Reserve or an election voting system based on complete
[35:30.440 --> 35:34.760]  fraud wherever you lack accountability you're going to have corruption that's
[35:34.760 --> 35:38.920]  just human nature if you lack accountability and transparency you
[35:38.920 --> 35:42.720]  are going to have corruption and when power is concentrated into the hands of
[35:42.720 --> 35:47.280]  the few you are going to have oppression you were going to have a the cancerous
[35:47.280 --> 35:51.800]  growth of more power at the expense of human dignity at the expense of human
[35:51.800 --> 35:56.280]  liberty this is what Thomas Jefferson warned us about this is what the Founding
[35:56.280 --> 36:01.680]  Fathers tried to structure so that we could prevent the cancerous growth of a
[36:01.680 --> 36:06.480]  power structure known as government that's the point of the Bill of Rights
[36:06.480 --> 36:10.720]  that's the point of the Fourth Amendment that is the point of saying that all
[36:10.720 --> 36:15.520]  powers not specifically granted to the federal government are reserved for the
[36:15.520 --> 36:20.920]  people and the states the ninth and tenth amendments that's the point of it
[36:20.920 --> 36:25.960]  you know it's funny you should do this folks if you have a liberal friend out
[36:25.960 --> 36:32.320]  there ask them some some time say hey hey liberal friend do you think do you
[36:32.320 --> 36:36.480]  think that government should have any limits whatsoever on its power or should
[36:36.480 --> 36:42.040]  government just have unlimited power knowing by the way that Hitler was an
[36:42.040 --> 36:46.480]  example of unlimited government power that Stalinist Russia was in another
[36:46.480 --> 36:51.200]  example of unlimited government power no Mao in China and so on do you think
[36:51.200 --> 36:54.520]  government should be limited in any way whatsoever and if they think about it if
[36:54.520 --> 36:59.360]  they're honest they will say to you well yeah I think maybe we should have some
[36:59.360 --> 37:04.480]  kind of limit on government powers some kind of limit and all you got to do is
[37:04.480 --> 37:09.280]  ask them well what kind of shape and structure should those limits be I mean
[37:09.280 --> 37:12.640]  what should be the limits of government power like for example should the
[37:12.640 --> 37:16.840]  government be able to simply arrest and assassinate and interrogate anybody at
[37:16.840 --> 37:21.240]  once at will at any time without charge without any kind of legal defense
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.080]  without due process and and and your friend will probably say oh no government
[37:26.080 --> 37:30.760]  should not be allowed to do that there should be a basic respect of due process
[37:30.760 --> 37:36.480]  and then you nail them you say Obama signed the NDAA on New Year's Eve last
[37:36.480 --> 37:42.320]  year 2011 that specifically authorizes secret kill list secret arrest
[37:42.320 --> 37:47.280]  imprisonment without charge the complete abolition of due process do you agree
[37:47.280 --> 37:51.480]  with that and then you got them because they have to admit well they they either
[37:51.480 --> 37:56.200]  they either agree with total tyranny or they disagree with Obama because those
[37:56.200 --> 38:02.320]  two ideas cannot be reconciled okay they are self contradictory you cannot
[38:02.320 --> 38:07.840]  have liberty and tyranny together you have to you have to decide which one
[38:07.840 --> 38:12.040]  you stand for and that's bottom line and everything that we talk about here at
[38:12.040 --> 38:15.520]  Info Wars anyway let me get back to the news I keep getting distracted with
[38:15.520 --> 38:20.440]  commentary here here here are some of the headlines coming out today human
[38:20.440 --> 38:26.640]  rights watch warns of robotic war crimes they have put out a warning which
[38:26.640 --> 38:31.760]  actually echoes the same warning that Alex has warned you about and info wars
[38:31.760 --> 38:34.880]  and I've even written about this as well we've all warned about this in fact
[38:34.880 --> 38:38.920]  here's a story by Paul Joseph Watson about armed drones to patrol the highways
[38:38.920 --> 38:43.680]  by 2025 you can check that out on info wars.com but the human rights watch
[38:43.680 --> 38:47.360]  group is saying if we keep going in the direction we're going with the
[38:47.360 --> 38:53.440]  development of humanoid shaped robots that can navigate terrain that can
[38:53.440 --> 38:59.680]  target civilians potentially you know human targets that have infrared
[38:59.680 --> 39:05.320]  cameras that to see heat from you know warm bodies that they can then target
[39:05.320 --> 39:10.200]  that could carry weapons that they they are being engineered to carry semi
[39:10.200 --> 39:15.000]  automatic rifles on the robot if we keep going in this direction it's only a
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.520]  matter of time before some tyrant that sits in power you know it's not going
[39:19.520 --> 39:23.920]  to be Obama hopefully hopefully he'll be out of power long before this happens
[39:23.920 --> 39:29.240]  but some future tyrant like Obama who doesn't respect due process could say
[39:29.240 --> 39:33.680]  hey I'm just going to unleash a hundred thousand armed robots hundred
[39:33.680 --> 39:39.720]  killers on the Texans let's say because we don't like to wait Texans are talking
[39:39.720 --> 39:44.360]  about not giving up their guns so we're going to unleash an army of terminators
[39:44.360 --> 39:49.720]  on the Texan people what's to stop them from doing that nothing nothing you see
[39:49.720 --> 39:55.320]  the reason that we have soldiers taken oath today is so that there is some
[39:55.320 --> 40:01.440]  resistance to an order that says go murder all these civilians or go invade
[40:01.440 --> 40:06.240]  this state or go kill these families or drop bombs on these innocent
[40:06.240 --> 40:10.800]  neighborhoods which is happening you know in the Middle East right now human
[40:10.800 --> 40:15.000]  beings are resistant at least they have there's some chance that they can resist
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.840]  the insanity that they can resist the tyranny and say no they can decide to
[40:18.840 --> 40:23.400]  say no because as we opened up the show with human beings have free will they
[40:23.400 --> 40:26.120]  have the ability to make that decision but if you have a robot in there a
[40:26.120 --> 40:31.000]  terminator hunter killer robot that's just following orders with no thinking no
[40:31.000 --> 40:36.080]  consciousness no soul whatsoever then that's out the window they can order the
[40:36.080 --> 40:39.680]  robots to go in and just mass murder anybody they want and that's what the
[40:39.680 --> 40:44.720]  military wants they want to take the humanity out of war the humanity out
[40:44.720 --> 40:49.760]  of the chain of command so that all they have is just they press a button they
[40:49.760 --> 40:53.840]  unleash humanoid robots to go in and take out whatever enemy they that they
[40:53.840 --> 40:58.600]  say is bad which of course eventually is going to be anybody who loves liberty
[40:58.600 --> 41:03.360]  anybody who believes in freedom anybody who believes in you know the
[41:03.360 --> 41:08.200]  republic basically anybody who follows Ron Paul or his philosophies more
[41:08.200 --> 41:13.880]  importantly than the person they will be targeted by autonomous robotic
[41:13.880 --> 41:17.240]  killing machines and that's that's going to happen if we don't stop it and it
[41:17.240 --> 41:21.840]  could happen in the next generation okay the next 20 to 25 years it could
[41:21.840 --> 41:27.080]  happen now along those lines by the year 2025 armed drones to patrol highways
[41:27.080 --> 41:34.720]  here we go you're gonna be chased down by highway drones that the LAPD will
[41:34.720 --> 41:41.760]  probably buy and deploy on the highways that was this was from the 2012 LA
[41:41.760 --> 41:47.800]  design challenge and manufacturers such as Honda BMW and General Motors are all
[41:47.800 --> 41:53.400]  looking at concept vehicles that are actually drones oh yeah you're gonna
[41:53.400 --> 41:59.040]  get chased down by a drone armed with weapons EMP weapons in this case to
[41:59.040 --> 42:03.280]  disable your car how beautiful is that hmm see this is the problem with
[42:03.280 --> 42:09.200]  technology without philosophy if you have technology with no ethics you end up
[42:09.200 --> 42:12.960]  with technology being exploited and abused by those who desire power over
[42:12.960 --> 42:17.720]  others and there's nothing wrong with technology per se but I've warned many
[42:17.720 --> 42:23.360]  times about runaway science bad science that's used to control people to poison
[42:23.360 --> 42:28.880]  the planet you know GMOs vaccines laced with mercury from aldehyde MSG a
[42:28.880 --> 42:33.280]  fluoride in the water that's not even real fluoride for example these these are
[42:33.280 --> 42:37.320]  examples of runaway bad science that actually harms humanity rather than
[42:37.320 --> 42:43.000]  helps it all right another story we had this massive pile up in Texas
[42:43.000 --> 42:49.000]  yesterday in southeast Texas two dead a hundred vehicle pile up now if you're
[42:49.000 --> 42:53.160]  not in Texas you might think why why does this matter to me it's a metaphor
[42:53.160 --> 42:57.440]  for what's going on first of all it was dense fog when people drive into dense
[42:57.440 --> 43:02.520]  fog they for some reason this is a this is a human trait they don't slow down
[43:02.520 --> 43:09.160]  they just assume that the fog isn't really obscuring any danger maybe they
[43:09.160 --> 43:15.160]  just think positive hey stay positive in the fog keep going 70 that's like that's
[43:15.160 --> 43:20.520]  like the the fatal optimist out there stay positive there couldn't be a an
[43:20.520 --> 43:24.440]  overturn tractor trailer in this dense fog on the interstate so just keep
[43:24.440 --> 43:30.760]  barreling through there guys you know pedal to the metal stay positive well
[43:30.760 --> 43:34.800]  the problem is that that doesn't work when there is a tractor trailer overturn
[43:34.800 --> 43:38.120]  on the highway and we're showing you some images right now for those of you
[43:38.120 --> 43:43.120]  watching on prison planet TV a hundred vehicles involved unfortunately two
[43:43.120 --> 43:50.440]  people killed over 50 injured and and it didn't need to happen if people would
[43:50.440 --> 43:55.280]  just slow down when they see fog because they overdrive they're stopping
[43:55.280 --> 43:59.880]  distance they by the time they they see an accident it's already 10 feet in front
[43:59.880 --> 44:03.080]  of them and they're doing 70 miles an hour and then it's just you know physics
[44:03.080 --> 44:08.200]  takes over but the point of all of this is and by the way you know may they
[44:08.200 --> 44:11.600]  rest in peace the souls that died in that accident I don't mean to make light
[44:11.600 --> 44:16.360]  of them of their deaths at all but to say that this is a metaphor for what
[44:16.360 --> 44:20.320]  we're have what's happening economically in America we are driving we are
[44:20.320 --> 44:27.800]  barreling into the fog of economic enslavement of global debt of currency
[44:27.800 --> 44:32.360]  debasement we are barreling through that at not 70 miles an hour not 80 miles an
[44:32.360 --> 44:37.280]  hour but a hundred miles an hour into a dense fog without any idea whether
[44:37.280 --> 44:41.080]  there's a wreck on the road in front of us metaphorically speaking with
[44:41.080 --> 44:46.160]  economics and there is a wreck on the road in front of us it's called the
[44:46.160 --> 44:49.880]  global debt collapse and it is coming and we're not going to be able to see it
[44:49.880 --> 44:55.240]  in time and we are going to collide with that wreck on the road so to speak
[44:55.240 --> 45:02.200]  and Obama wants us to drive faster into it which some people say maybe that's a
[45:02.200 --> 45:06.040]  good thing because the economic collapse will come sooner and we will you
[45:06.040 --> 45:09.880]  know learn the hard lessons of human civilization we'll be able to recover
[45:09.880 --> 45:14.000]  from it more quickly but in any case it's going to be bad it's going to be a
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.920]  massive economic train wreck like the entire nation is barreling at a hundred
[45:18.920 --> 45:23.760]  miles an hour into a dense fog with massive wreckage all over the road and
[45:23.760 --> 45:27.440]  they have no idea what they're about to run into so that if you can visualize
[45:27.440 --> 45:31.800]  that that wreck of a hundred vehicles in the fog on the highway that is a
[45:31.800 --> 45:35.080]  metaphor for what's going to be happening with our economy soon so
[45:35.080 --> 45:39.400]  watch out for that here it comes might be good time to bail out of the car or
[45:39.400 --> 45:43.480]  at least slow down and pull to the side buy some gold and silver insulate
[45:43.480 --> 45:48.560]  yourself from from what is coming so that you're not harmed by it all right
[45:48.560 --> 45:54.680]  now we've got a video coming up with David Ortiz special report about good cop
[45:54.680 --> 46:00.760]  bad cop and this is going to show you some images and some disturbing scenes
[46:00.760 --> 46:05.120]  of police brutality I want to preface this by saying again not all cops are
[46:05.120 --> 46:08.160]  bad I know a lot of good cops there are many sheriffs out there who are fighting
[46:08.160 --> 46:11.840]  for liberty but there is abuse out there there is brutality of innocent
[46:11.840 --> 46:17.320]  Americans and that is the subject of this video so watch it and spread the
[46:17.320 --> 46:21.400]  word and we'll be right back after this video with more take a look for info
[46:21.400 --> 46:26.760]  Wars nightly news I'm David Ortiz they take an oath to protect and serve yet
[46:26.760 --> 46:30.640]  despite this noble mission statement the law enforcement profession remains
[46:30.640 --> 46:36.200]  extremely polarizing the main reasons for the public cynicism is abuse of power
[46:36.200 --> 46:40.960]  and immunity from the law let's take a look at some examples of these abuses
[46:40.960 --> 46:45.080]  meet officer Joseph Schmidt of the Oakland Illinois Police Department as
[46:45.080 --> 46:51.000]  seen on this video in 2010 he was off duty at a Hooters restaurant when the
[46:51.000 --> 46:56.160]  then 54-year-old Livier Torres got into an argument with a waitress over her
[46:56.160 --> 47:00.400]  bill officer Schmidt soon intervened in the matter and despite the fact that
[47:00.400 --> 47:05.200]  Ms. Torres was clearly not a threat he decided to arrest her and did so by
[47:05.200 --> 47:09.320]  pulling her hair and using excessive force according to Ms. Torres as
[47:09.320 --> 47:14.120]  attorney many witnesses say the officer also slapped her soon after this
[47:14.120 --> 47:18.600]  incident a judge ruled that Ms. Torres and not the officer was in the wrong
[47:18.600 --> 47:25.680]  sentencing her to 200 days in jail she only served about 94 of those days the
[47:25.680 --> 47:30.000]  judge also stated that Ms. Torres had a history of DUIs and other violations
[47:30.000 --> 47:34.480]  repeated calls to the Oakland Illinois Police Department to comment on this
[47:34.480 --> 47:41.120]  matter were not answered now let's take a look at this bad cop in 2009 Lincoln
[47:41.120 --> 47:46.240]  Rhode Island police officer Edward Crowitz kicked an intoxicated handcuffed
[47:46.240 --> 47:50.960]  woman who was seated on a curb in the head after she kicked his shin
[47:50.960 --> 47:56.240]  despite being found guilty of felony battery with a dangerous weapon the
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.280]  officer was only sentenced to counseling and 10 years probation he also
[48:01.280 --> 48:05.920]  resigned after public pressure however he may still be eligible for a pension
[48:05.920 --> 48:11.040]  according to Reason magazine one reason why officers are treated above the
[48:11.040 --> 48:16.040]  law is due to legislation called the police officers Bill of Rights as a
[48:16.040 --> 48:21.240]  result of this legislation officers in dozens of US states are allowed to
[48:21.240 --> 48:26.240]  experience godlike privileges among them unlike a member of the public the
[48:26.240 --> 48:31.760]  officer under investigation gets a quote cooling off period before he has to
[48:31.760 --> 48:36.840]  respond to any questions unlike a member of the public the officer under
[48:36.840 --> 48:41.040]  investigation is also privy to the name of his complaints and their
[48:41.040 --> 48:45.960]  testimonies against him before he is interrogated unlike a member of the
[48:45.960 --> 48:50.200]  public the officer under investigation is to be interrogated at a quote a
[48:50.200 --> 48:56.040]  reasonable hour with a union member present unlike a member of the public the
[48:56.040 --> 49:00.960]  officer can only be questioned by one person during his interrogation unlike a
[49:00.960 --> 49:05.920]  member of the public the officer can be interrogated only for quote a reasonable
[49:05.920 --> 49:11.440]  periods which shall be timed to allow for such personal necessities and rest
[49:11.440 --> 49:16.640]  periods as are reasonably necessary unlike a member of the public the
[49:16.640 --> 49:20.760]  officer under investigation cannot be quote threatened with disciplinary
[49:20.760 --> 49:25.520]  action at any point during the investigation if he is threatened with
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.120]  punishment whatever he says following the threat cannot be used against him
[49:30.120 --> 49:35.680]  now contrary to these thugs there are some hero cops meet officer Ivan
[49:35.680 --> 49:41.800]  Marcano of the NYPD last month the officer was off duty in the Bronx when
[49:41.800 --> 49:46.480]  he saw two individuals trying to rob someone at gunpoint officer Marcano
[49:46.480 --> 49:50.200]  fired and killed one of the perpetrators the other robber and a getaway
[49:50.200 --> 49:55.560]  driver ran away however officer Marcano who was shot in the chest and will live
[49:55.560 --> 50:01.040]  is credited by the victim as having saved his life and here we also have
[50:01.040 --> 50:06.400]  some video of a heroic cop named officer Jimmy Jaleel of the Boca Raton
[50:06.400 --> 50:11.920]  Florida police force in late 2010 officer Jaleel was called to a car crash
[50:11.920 --> 50:17.680]  scene soon after his arrival the car which crashed caught fire trapping the
[50:17.680 --> 50:22.720]  victim who had broken her legs inside officer Jaleel swiftly sprung into
[50:22.720 --> 50:26.920]  action and after shooting the passenger window pulled the woman out of the
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.320]  vehicle according to witnesses there is no doubt the female victim would have
[50:31.320 --> 50:36.800]  burned to death had she not been rescued to these last two officers we salute

[54:21.720 --> 54:27.680]  Thanksgiving broadcasting live from the InfoWars studios in Austin Texas and
[54:27.680 --> 54:32.340]  thank you for continuing with us we've got teens in custody after Woodland Mall
[54:32.340 --> 54:37.760]  fight last night or early this morning actually a disturbance leads to a scare
[54:37.760 --> 54:42.560]  at Westroads Mall I think that was where there was a shooting a couple years ago
[54:42.560 --> 54:48.360]  we've got Black Friday arrest caught on camera and by the way check out drudgeryport.com
[54:48.360 --> 54:54.960]  for some breaking news on on the Black Friday shoppers and stampes and people
[54:54.960 --> 55:01.760]  pulling weapons on each other standing in line and footage of people going after
[55:01.760 --> 55:08.000]  I guess discounted cell phones they're they're they're fighting and trampling
[55:08.000 --> 55:11.800]  each other to get these discounted cell phones hey don't they know they can get
[55:11.800 --> 55:16.960]  a free Obama phone they don't even need to wait in line fight over it didn't
[55:16.960 --> 55:20.480]  they know that man somebody needs to update these people give him a sign
[55:20.480 --> 55:27.080]  something maybe I you know I think I think that if you went to these lines
[55:27.080 --> 55:30.920]  and just held up a sign that said free vaccines while you're standing in line
[55:30.920 --> 55:35.560]  probably 90% would say yeah go ahead you know shoot me up with a vaccine why
[55:35.560 --> 55:42.040]  not standing in line already all right Alex asked me this morning to to cover
[55:42.040 --> 55:48.040]  a little bit about Texas's secession and so my thoughts on that subject were
[55:48.040 --> 55:54.200]  encapsulated in an article I published recently on natural news about why Texas
[55:54.200 --> 56:00.840]  in particular is well positioned to actually secede now in effect what
[56:00.840 --> 56:05.240]  Alex has been promoting you know last week when he called for perhaps a
[56:05.240 --> 56:10.040]  second American Revolution but it's really the the reconstitution of America
[56:10.040 --> 56:16.440]  not to be separate but to be together with the restoration of constitutional
[56:16.440 --> 56:21.400]  liberty that's what we need and so neither Alex nor myself wants Texas to
[56:21.400 --> 56:26.320]  be a separate nation we want Texas to be part of a union based in liberty to
[56:26.320 --> 56:30.040]  restore the Constitution to limit government as it is supposed to be
[56:30.040 --> 56:33.800]  limited under the Constitution and especially to protect the people under
[56:33.800 --> 56:40.640]  the Bill of Rights but theoretically if Texas were to secede it could succeed as
[56:40.640 --> 56:45.920]  a nation state better than any other state and here's why check this out and
[56:45.920 --> 56:50.200]  I gave this this list but did you know that Texas is the only state with its
[56:50.200 --> 56:54.760]  own power grid that's right the only state with its own well I should say in
[56:54.760 --> 56:59.400]  the 48 contiguous states the only state with its own power grid everything else
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.480]  is connected to the either the eastern grid or the western grid Texas can grow
[57:03.480 --> 57:07.920]  more than enough food to feed itself and not a lot of states can do that maybe
[57:07.920 --> 57:12.520]  California can but not a lot of other states Texas is the energy empire of
[57:12.520 --> 57:16.920]  America the energy hub I don't know if you've ever gone on to Google Earth and
[57:16.920 --> 57:23.560]  or maps you know Yahoo maps or whatever and looked at the satellite images of the
[57:23.560 --> 57:28.920]  the Texas the Houston Texas port where that river comes in off of up from
[57:28.920 --> 57:33.920]  Galveston you go north and then you head into Houston on this river that is
[57:33.920 --> 57:39.760]  lined with petroleum reserves massive mess I don't know how many billions of
[57:39.760 --> 57:44.360]  gallons of petroleum are stored right in that area plus Texas has physical
[57:44.360 --> 57:49.120]  possession of the refineries and and is very close to all the offshore drilling
[57:49.120 --> 57:54.600]  rigs in the Gulf of Mexico. Texas also has a huge amount of natural gas and even
[57:54.600 --> 58:00.320]  solar resources if you go that direction Texas is the energy capital of America
[58:00.320 --> 58:04.880]  in addition Texas has technology and telecommunications a lot of high-tech in
[58:04.880 --> 58:09.000]  Texas including in the Austin area of course Dallas-Fort Worth even got the
[58:09.000 --> 58:15.160]  basic infrastructure of a space program Texas has natural resources and a can do
[58:15.160 --> 58:20.200]  attitude and guess what a lot of firearms in the hands of patriots and
[58:20.200 --> 58:23.960]  rugged individuals who know how to survive and they're not giving those
[58:23.960 --> 58:28.760]  guns up not for nothing nope you talk to Texans they'll tell you not giving it up
[58:28.760 --> 58:32.600]  for anything anyway straight ahead Ed group is coming up so stay with us here

[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.680]  chemicals and heavy metals and even light metals that are found in foods Ed
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.360]  welcome to the Alex Jones show today how you doing I'm doing great thanks for
[01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:17.320]  having me on good good to have you on man so now this segment not all not all
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.480]  the radio stations carry this segment so you know we'll recap a little bit of
[01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:27.080]  this in a couple of minutes but first of all what do you what are the most toxic
[01:02:27.080 --> 01:02:31.640]  foods that people tend to get during the holiday season well I mean pretty much
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:35.320]  all the foods are toxic during the holiday season I mean even the organic
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.760]  food that's because everything is cooked and a lot of it is canned and a lot of
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.880]  it is processed and not only that it contains a lot of artificial ingredients
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:50.120]  some of it could be GMO it's a lot of sugar if I was to pick my number one
[01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:54.200]  toxic holiday food it would probably be dessert and the reason why is because
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:59.880]  people indulge so much over the holiday season they do three four times the
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.600]  amount that they normally do that's why some people gain five to ten pounds from
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:10.160]  November to January but the most difficult thing for the body to handle
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:14.720]  is the amount of food and what happens to the food when they eat it because
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:19.120]  also during the holiday season people drink a lot more alcohol they drink a
[01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:23.720]  lot more coffee they drink a lot more diet drinks and they decrease the amount
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.000]  of water that they put in their system so what happens let's say yesterday for
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.200]  example when everybody was pigging out from the morning all the way through the
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.400]  evening watching football and doing all the normal things you also have to
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:40.240]  factor in during the holidays that most people are sedentary or they're not
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:45.240]  moving around they're not exercising as much so if you were to put every single
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:50.200]  thing that someone ate yesterday for example in a trash can and put it out
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:55.520]  in the 98.6 degree heat which is the body temperature what you have is a
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:59.640]  combination of foods which are actually more toxic than the food to
[01:03:59.640 --> 01:04:05.560]  themselves because when you mix wine or beer and turkey and dressing and all
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:13.600]  these things together it just forms this chemical slew inside your system to
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.240]  liquid either when they when they swallow it down because they're in a hurry to
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.920]  eat they want to just force more food and more food down into their system so
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:25.480]  that also becomes a major strain on the digestive system and and the lack of
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:29.600]  enzymes that they have to break it down so that's who stays in the intestinal
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:33.160]  track way way too long and then they keep doing that over and over and over
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:38.200]  and then the proteins put your thigh the carbohydrates ferment and then the
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.840]  fats turn rancid and that's where you're starting to get all these real toxic
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:45.600]  compounds doesn't sound good add like four-day-old turkey making its way

[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:59.480]  filling in for Alex today and we've got our guest Ed group joining us to talk
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:04.040]  about the toxic foods that we tend to run into during the holiday season and
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:08.920]  what you can do to avoid those toxic elements in the foods as well as then
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:15.640]  detox yourself after you've gorge yourself with all the GMO turkey and you
[01:09:15.640 --> 01:09:18.480]  know heavy metals in the foods and everything else that we tend to eat
[01:09:18.480 --> 01:09:22.680]  during the holiday season so Ed not everybody heard what you said in the
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.720]  last segment could you recap very quickly that combination that you're
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:31.320]  talking about the beer and the turkey and the sedentary lifestyle during these
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:35.400]  holiday breaks go ahead and just recap that for us talking about what the
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:39.240]  toxic holiday foods are and I was saying that pretty much everything is toxic
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:42.320]  out there because it's boxed and canned and cooked and everything else but
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:46.600]  really the main problem that we've seen dealing with people over the years is
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.760]  that it's not only the toxic food but the combination of those foods once they
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:56.840]  sit in your system when you mix alcohol and beer and white sugar together and
[01:09:56.840 --> 01:10:02.680]  desserts and stuffing and breads with gluten and GMOs together you have this
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:08.280]  toxic chemical slew that sits inside the digestive system way way too long and
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:11.920]  the proteins turn putrefactic the carbohydrates ferment and the fats
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.240]  turn rancid and that's where you're getting the real real toxic chemicals
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:20.640]  that are leaking back into the bloodstream because people overeat during
[01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.960]  the holidays and they don't have as many bowel movements and they're generally
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:29.120]  extremely constipated as well so because they're not actively moving
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:32.480]  they're sedentary they're sitting down watching football games they're they've
[01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:37.760]  eaten too much food and they can't move so that's what happens with the majority
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:40.760]  of people and that's why people are lethargic and they feel bad generally
[01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.320]  over the holidays because they're not moving that stuff out of their system
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:48.520]  but there's a lot of social pressure during the holidays you know to just
[01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:54.800]  sit down join the family you know let your food guard down for a couple of
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:58.120]  days and just you know just eat whatever's in front of you I mean that's
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:01.080]  that's part of the culture so I think I think some people listening would say
[01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:05.080]  that you and I are maybe a little too uptight and we should you know we
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.240]  should stop harping on these people for what they're gonna eat during the
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:12.800]  holidays what would you say to someone who has that comment well I would you
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:16.680]  say that there's even if you want to eat all that toxic food there's still
[01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.840]  ways that you can get it out of your system really fast I mean what my
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:24.000]  recommendation is first of all if you don't want to radically change your
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.880]  Thanksgiving day dinner or your Christmas or holiday meals just switch it all to
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.360]  organic right there you're already saving yourself a lot of chemicals and
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:36.080]  GMOs and other things but the best and the easiest way to do it is to chew your
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.200]  food really good before you swallow it because when your food mixes with the
[01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:44.640]  enzymes in your mouth your enzymes are already breaking a lot of that food down
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.120]  and taking care of the some of those chemicals and you're able to digest and
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:53.680]  you get full faster that way so you end up not eating as much another thing I
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:59.480]  recommend is not to eat after 8 p.m. and one of the one of the best things that
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.680]  we hear every single year is in the easiest way to get all that stuff out
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:07.920]  of your system is to use an oxygen based intestinal cleanser which is
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:10.680]  something you can take that will release oxygen and choose through
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.960]  everything and by the next morning all that stuff is completely out of your
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.920]  system instead of sitting in there three to four to five days and being able to
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:23.200]  turn into all those chemicals which will then leak into your bloodstream
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:28.360]  so the key is when it comes in get it out as fast as you can and the only
[01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:32.800]  thing safe to use would like I said would be an oxygen cleanser I mean some
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:37.520]  people actually take psyllium husk or some extra fiber but that ends up a lot
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:42.080]  of times expanding in the intestines and blocking them up even further well
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.760]  but what about the greens for example the the inner food products that are
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:49.400]  sold here at the infowars store those are really good it isn't can't you use
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:54.400]  those defensively where let's say before your your your big dinner or
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:59.000]  something you you know you drink a superfood shake a green superfood shake
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.880]  and then that way you eat less of the toxic food and also you've got all those
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.920]  greens and other herbs in there to buffer your body to help protect your body
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.680]  from the toxic things that you're eating does that does that make sense oh
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.120]  absolutely I mean absolutely if the if the general public did that it would be
[01:13:14.120 --> 01:13:18.760]  it would be great and we would save a lot of time and you know save a lot of
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.600]  heartache another good thing which I recommend to people is for them to take
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:26.240]  some enzymes and digestive enzymes you know 20 minutes before their meal are
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.280]  right at the time that they that they are eating after their first bite of the
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:36.280]  meal and that will help them break down the food better it's been studied that
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:41.600]  most people run out of enzymes by the time they're 28 years old and that's
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.280]  just because of all the cooked foods is because everything that the body has to
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:51.520]  produce to break these things down on a regular basis so enzymes would be another
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:57.800]  trick that someone could do to help you know help their digestive tract yeah you
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:01.040]  know move things through a little bit better and to drink water between meals
[01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:04.240]  instead of all the dehydrating things that they're drinking like the beer and
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:09.880]  the alcohol and the soda the diet drinks you over the holidays you also see an
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:14.360]  increased amount of dehydration so if you're drinking a good purified water
[01:14:14.360 --> 01:14:18.400]  between your meals that'll also help move the the toxic food in the sludge
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:22.360]  through your intestines faster we're listening to an interview folks with
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:27.360]  ed group from global healing center dot-com an expert in the detoxification
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.600]  and that's a good point there Ed you can you know you can enjoy your family
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:35.840]  time and just drink water no one's going to give you a hard time for not
[01:14:35.840 --> 01:14:40.560]  drinking let's say diet soda or even not drinking a beer you can just say you
[01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:45.440]  know I'm I'm just drinking water today and enjoying time with family having
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:48.480]  some some of the Thanksgiving meal or Christmas meal or whatever you're
[01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.480]  focused on and and drinking some purified water that can go a long way
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.320]  towards helping you you know eliminate all these toxins that you might be
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:59.040]  taken in and when they you know offer you that extra piece of pie or the extra
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:02.600]  serving you can just turn that down and just say no you know I'm not ready for
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.520]  that right now and and try to get up and walk around and move around a little
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:10.720]  bit more too I mean you can you can walk around do some jumping jacks or
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.120]  something while you're watching TV or you know just try to get a try to be a
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.600]  little bit more active during the holidays and that'll help push everything
[01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:21.920]  down as well all right you ready to take a few calls that we've got some
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.920]  callers on the line sure all right let's go to John in Texas John you're on the
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:32.000]  phone with Ed group welcome to the show hello guys how you doing I have some a
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:35.760]  couple of big issues but it's not with me I've been pretty healthy for a while
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:40.840]  now with a bunch of organic and listening to Dr. Wallach and Ben Feud so my wife
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:44.760]  never really believed me and she worked at a hospital and she recently she took
[01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:50.560]  the H1N1 shot at the same time she took a vaccine shot and now and she's
[01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:55.320]  listening she's 40 years old now and she was perfectly healthy before now her
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:59.640]  blood pressure is off the route she has type 2 diabetes this is in a year of the
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:06.240]  shot and now her gallbladder is at 15% and she just went to the doctor and I'm
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:09.840]  pretty desperate here because they want a scheduled appointment to take her gall
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:16.000]  bladder out already no man and I just don't know what to do let's give this
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.000]  to Ed but let me preface that by saying those vaccine shots do contain as the
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:24.760]  CDC has admitted they do contain mercury they do contain formaldehyde
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:31.240]  MSG antibiotics and aluminum and those combinations are of course very toxic to
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.680]  many organs in the body what are your thoughts Ed on his wife's reaction to
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:40.320]  the vaccines well you know I'd like to add one more thing with the with the
[01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:45.200]  vaccines is recombinant RNA and DNA fragments which I think now they're
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:51.480]  they're altering to to cause genetic changes within your own body as well but
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:56.160]  without having a full I mean the most you can do and what I tell people is to
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:59.600]  just try to educate them as much as possible you know when we had patients
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:04.200]  that would bring their husband or their wife in and say we want you to do this
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:07.640]  but then that person wasn't the first thing we would do of course would it
[01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:12.120]  would be to educate them and on all those different things and how to eliminate
[01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:15.960]  toxins from your daily life and from your environment in which you live your
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:20.280]  work environment your home environment but with what you're just giving the
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:23.640]  information you're just giving me what I would do is just probably say to go
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:28.680]  ahead and email me or contact is that support at global healing center com
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:33.280]  with a little more detailed list of what you're going through maybe we can
[01:17:33.280 --> 01:17:39.240]  provide you with some information that's in a good readable format to give to

[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:13.440]  because the liberal media has been suppressing what has fast become in the
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:19.360]  most shocking news story of 2012 Obama's secret war on coal that could increase
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:24.560]  your already high power bill as much as 400% in coming months as shocking as it
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:28.420]  sounds it may well be just a matter of time before the lights start going out
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:32.920]  across America but here's some good news there's an underground video at
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.920]  exposed123.com that thousands of smart patriots have used to end their
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:42.880]  slavery to the corrupt electricity monopoly the video at exposed123.com
[01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:47.200]  has already been banned by Google and the liberal media is doing everything in
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.080]  its power to take it down and keep America in the dark so watch it now

[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:22.440]  back thanks for joining us here on the Alex Jones show on this Friday the day
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:27.320]  after Thanksgiving this is Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex
[01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:31.280]  today and we've got Ed group a detox expert on the line we've been taking
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:35.960]  some interesting calls including a guy who called from Hardee's restaurant with
[01:24:35.960 --> 01:24:40.560]  his kids in the background lamenting about how unhealthy the food
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:46.480]  probably was there that that's that that takes some guts to call in from from
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:53.440]  Hardee's and ask about detox but hey folks watch out check the KFC menu for
[01:24:53.440 --> 01:25:00.200]  those of you who eat fried chicken the KFC has MSG in almost almost everything
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:04.240]  on their menu has MSG in it okay almost everything read read their facts if you
[01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:08.360]  want to see what's really in the food that I think no restaurant uses MSG more
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:13.320]  than Kentucky fried chicken but I want to show you what I'm eating today in
[01:25:13.320 --> 01:25:16.920]  addition to my normal for those of you watching on prisonplanet.tv in addition
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:21.760]  to my normal chocolate avocado superfood smoothie that's here in this glass
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:27.880]  mason jar and mostly consumed by now I've also got my non-gmo organic gluten
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.920]  free pancakes right here showing you on camera brought these from home yeah I
[01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:38.360]  made these this morning aren't those beautiful with coconut oil on a non-stick
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:43.480]  I mean a non-non-stick pan I just use stainless steel pans with a big copper
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:48.440]  bottom I don't cook on Teflon or non-stick surfaces I don't use a gluten in
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.360]  the pancakes I don't use butter on them I just you know make healthy stuff and
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:57.560]  bring it in and that's what powers me through these info wars shows Ed group
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:26:03.160]  what did you have for breakfast this morning man I had for breakfast this
[01:26:03.160 --> 01:26:10.480]  morning a juice actually a green juice today I had some vegan this was my
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:15.920]  Thanksgiving dinner I had vegan stuffing which normally I'm about 95% raw
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:21.720]  food but yesterday I actually gave in and had a small multiple small
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.760]  servings but most of the day actually ate raw yesterday and today the only
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:32.760]  thing I had was for our noon lunch which was just a family get together was
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:37.160]  just some different kinds of mushroom organic vegan mushroom gravy with
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.440]  shiitake and portobello mushrooms and some other mushrooms in there that my
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:45.680]  wife cooked and then I had a vegan cornbread dressing and a little bit of
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:50.000]  organic mashed potatoes and that was but a lot of people listening though Ed are
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.560]  gonna say just like I mentioned last segment that you know they don't know
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:57.040]  how to do that they don't know those recipes and their families don't cook
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:00.960]  that way they're gonna have you know a big Christmas ham they're gonna have a
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:04.960]  big Thanksgiving turkey and they don't really know even where the turkey came
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:09.160]  from is probably fed GMO corn to make it that big so they could sell it by the
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.560]  pound you know if you're if folks if you're eating if you're eating non
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:18.800]  organic beef or chicken or pork or turkey you know it's probably fattened up
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:23.760]  with GMOs is it isn't that true Ed yes it is I mean in all the other stuff I
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:26.880]  mean most of those animals are schizophrenic at the time of butchering
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:31.960]  which puts other toxins into the meat like hormones yeah well they're
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:35.320]  injected with hormones they're injected with vaccinations they're fed
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:40.440]  antibiotics they're fed GMO corn and different types of toxic feed to begin
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:45.880]  with they're not range fed so you know maybe this year you can early now
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:49.000]  Thanksgiving's over but for Christmas everybody can get together with their
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:54.200]  family whoever's doing the purchasing and possibly look at local markets you
[01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:58.840]  know purchasing from local farmers markets or getting shares locally or
[01:27:58.840 --> 01:28:03.560]  something like that and then looking into for a meat choice a better meat
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:10.640]  choice either wild game venison something like that or a good source of
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:18.720]  range-fed organic fish or you know other sources of meat yeah hey I saw like I
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:23.080]  guess about 20 turkeys wild turkeys running around the ranch where I am in
[01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:28.840]  Texas and neighbor neighbor walked by with a with a field shotgun said we're
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:33.720]  gonna go get one of them I said well go for it man it's that's healthier than
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:37.400]  eating the stuff you buy at the store yeah it is I mean it's you know that's
[01:28:37.400 --> 01:28:41.200]  that's true wild game that's how they used to do it a long time ago and
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:45.680]  personally I don't eat I don't eat meat but that took me a long time to get to
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.160]  that I don't recommend people just stop eating meat I mean I was having
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:53.280]  digestive problems in my in my 20s because I was raised on meat and potatoes
[01:28:53.280 --> 01:28:59.080]  and and you know dairy and everything else but I slowly eliminated it for
[01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:03.080]  health reasons over a long period of time at first I just cut it out immediately
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:07.760]  and then I got sick I was pale I wasn't you know I had very low energy and then
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:12.040]  I realized real fast that I needed to take my time with this and let my body
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:16.120]  adapt to it over a long period of time and and some people make that a lot of
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:19.120]  people actually make that mistake they think they can just cut out meat
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:23.920]  completely and then everything's fine especially the O blood type people and
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.920]  what they need to do is take it slow I mean everything should be a slow
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:31.440]  transition so the body has time to adapt all right can you stay with us for
[01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.600]  just a couple more minutes on the other side is break it oh absolutely okay all
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.000]  right well we'll be right back after this message then with more just a few

[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:52.080]  commentary about what's going on in the american culture where people are trained

[01:33:57.600 --> 01:34:03.040]  electronics that they probably don't even need that that tend to even enslave
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:07.920]  them in some ways like your you know your iphone tracker device and your your
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:13.720]  brainwashing flat panel TV device that inserts the false ideas into your head
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:18.400]  through corporate run news and so-called entertainment programming anyway

[01:34:29.800 --> 01:34:33.360]  and with all the chemicals and toxins being sprayed on the food it's gonna be
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:37.440]  a major issue that's true the big shortage from the the drought of last
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.000]  summer of the most recent summer that's gonna kick in and about January and
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:46.600]  February people are gonna see food prices really skyrocket and that doesn't
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:52.040]  even count you know inflation due to currency debasement so anyway okay

[01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:18.240]  illegitimate commander in chief being knowledgeable about General Hamm and the

[01:37:34.960 --> 01:37:39.160]  go to Roger in Arizona Roger you're on the air do you have a question for Ed
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:43.800]  Group yes hi Mike hey thanks for taking the call long time
[01:37:43.800 --> 01:37:49.000]  Mr. first-time caller yeah just over over yesterday yeah reading some of the
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.080]  labels getting educated on the GMOs and all the products that are out there you
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:38:00.120]  find in buying organic material and using that to prepare a nice healthy
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:03.960]  meal for the family you know we've got family that comes over they expect
[01:38:03.960 --> 01:38:08.440]  sauces and gravies and you know biscuits and all these different things and I'm
[01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:11.960]  reading that the labels on a lot of those things and you know they're soy
[01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:17.560]  lectin and neocame and aspartame yeah it's almost impossible to get away from
[01:38:17.560 --> 01:38:22.560]  that so if there's any I guess my question is is there any way to try to
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:27.200]  100% eliminate that those poisons from the diet all right that's that's to you
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:32.800]  Ed go ahead you have a lot of different label ingredients that you want to try
[01:38:32.800 --> 01:38:36.880]  to avoid and they're getting really tricky I mean natural flavors even though
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:41.880]  it sounds like it's it's okay can be toxic to contain a MSG you want to look
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:48.240]  up for soy lectin titanium dioxide I mean there's a whole list of different
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:52.520]  ingredients that you want to avoid and the best advice I can tell you is to get
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:59.040]  online usually that's what I do and try to find recipes for different types of
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:04.560]  holiday snacks or holiday food that you can make yourself using either grain
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:10.720]  free or gluten free flowers you can also use different types of ingredients
[01:39:10.720 --> 01:39:15.120]  natural ingredients instead of toxic ingredients usually what whenever you
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:18.840]  buy anything in a box or pre-made that's where you're going to have those
[01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:21.960]  preservatives and everything it's a little bit more time-consuming to do
[01:39:21.960 --> 01:39:25.800]  things yourself but I mean you should really be putting your energy into the
[01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:29.800]  food anyway it makes it it makes it taste better and it's even healthier for
[01:39:29.800 --> 01:39:35.680]  you so I would suggest that maybe taking this year and going on there's a lot of
[01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:39.400]  recipes online and believe it or not a lot of people are in the same situation
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:44.680]  that you are and so you're not going to find those things at the store usually
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:51.360]  even you know even Whole Foods 30% of their stuff is contains GMO so well
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:54.520]  you're going to want to just find the recipes from the people like myself and
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:39:59.080]  people other people that have been cooking and and looking at different
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:05.080]  recipes and modified those recipes for gluten-free vegan or even you know
[01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:11.040]  even standard recipes that just don't include those toxic chemical basically
[01:40:11.040 --> 01:40:15.680]  you're going to have to cook the way our grandparents did all the non-toxic sugars
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:21.000]  and then mix it all together you can hear me and make your own food and yeah
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.600]  good good comments I was sorry I was trying to interject there to say you're
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:26.080]  gonna have we're gonna have to go back and cook the way our grandparents did
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:31.080]  which is from raw materials you know like unprocessed ingredients and put those
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:35.120]  meals together from scratch is essentially it exactly and and to make
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:40.880]  sure that we get those those materials as an organic material wherever possible
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:44.840]  or wildcrafted if not organic I want to thank you for your call Roger and also
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.520]  Ed thank you for joining us it's been a good segment with you and I want to

[01:41:10.280 --> 01:41:15.720]  TSA and I'm sorry not TSA the Black Friday secrets video that Alex has just
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:20.120]  recorded this morning we run that video and then I'll be back after that video
[01:41:20.120 --> 01:41:25.440]  with some commentary on the video it'll be ready here in just a second and then
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:29.880]  we'll continue to take calls in following that and in the next segment just
[01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:35.280]  cue me guys when it is ready now okay we're ready now let's go ahead and run
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:38.960]  that video it's about five minutes long this is Alex's commentary from this
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:46.000]  morning about Black Friday let's take a look many species of mammal will run
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:51.240]  themselves off of cliffs sheep will do it you see whales that beats themselves
[01:41:51.240 --> 01:41:55.400]  sometimes for no reason but not just mammals other species will will beats
[01:41:55.400 --> 01:42:00.120]  themselves or run off the edge of a cliff we see what linnings like to do and
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.080]  we see this throughout human cultures when people become disconnected from the
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:13.120]  land disconnected from basic human activities and we are seeing this to an
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:18.720]  extreme degree with the disgusting manifestation that is the madness of
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:23.600]  Black Friday each year in the last decade getting more and more insane the
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.560]  day after Thanksgiving in some cases thousands of people rushing into
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:33.760]  Walmart's begging screaming grabbing just getting something I mean I'm not
[01:42:33.760 --> 01:42:38.760]  saying that consumerism or wanting things or submaterialism is purely evil
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:43.040]  you need materialism you need food water clothing things to take care of
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:47.040]  yourself but when it becomes the ultimate goal of your life and when just the
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:52.920]  action of going out almost like it's a hunting competition and fighting over
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:59.120]  goods and just snatching something up and feeling like that you got a part of
[01:42:59.120 --> 01:43:04.000]  the deal so you're a winner it is at the heart of why our society is falling
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:10.080]  apart it shows the triumph of empty hype the triumph of empty fraud let me give
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:14.120]  you a segue example into the flu vaccine I've covered this a lot on the
[01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:19.800]  radio I've read mainstream news articles saying there are no side effects
[01:43:19.800 --> 01:43:23.760]  period from the flu shot it cannot hurt you don't believe conspiracy theorist
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:28.600]  don't believe wild rumors and then I can show the CDC's own website which you
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.280]  can go look up with hundreds and hundreds of bad reactions including death
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:40.560]  comas guion beret neurological disorder for every major vaccine I mean just go to CDC side
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:44.920]  effects adverse reactions do it right now CDC.gov I've probably done this 20
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:50.280]  times this year on the radio and TV shown people this but the hype they have
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:54.680]  ads for flu shots on billboards they companies are pressuring people to take
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:59.680]  it not just hospitals now it is a cult and it doesn't matter of all the studies
[01:43:59.680 --> 01:44:02.960]  show it doubles your chances of getting the flu that year in the next that it's
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.560]  never been created to actually block that year's flu they've never guessed the
[01:44:07.560 --> 01:44:14.600]  strain it is a total complete absolute verified hoax and I was reading a Fox
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:18.080]  News article and also a Wall Street Journal article this morning something
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:21.880]  I already knew that the best deals are the days after Christmas that the best
[01:44:21.880 --> 01:44:25.280]  deals come even in January with overstock stuff that the best deals are
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:31.320]  online and that Black Friday is not even a good deal on average in a scam so
[01:44:31.320 --> 01:44:36.000]  again that's a hoax as well but the standing in line all night instead of
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.600]  spending time with your family and then rushing in when the store opens at
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:45.240]  midnight on Friday going to the day of Friday is just totally empty and I know
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:49.440]  that many of us know and understand this but if you look at the people so show
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:53.080]  economically and I've got studies on this you just look at the poor crowds of
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:56.520]  people fighting and stumbling and trampling each other to death these are
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:00.160]  the same people that want their free Obama phone these are the same people
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:04.320]  that think higher taxes will somehow redistribute wealth to them they're
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:08.840]  looking for a free ride it's the lottery ticket crowd and it's out there in
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.280]  every race culture religion area of the world George Arwell wrote about it in
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:18.560]  1948 in 1984 about how in the future people only care about their lottery
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:21.640]  tickets that wouldn't care about their freedom even though the whole lottery is
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:26.560]  obviously rigged it's like people that go to Vegas but under this new older
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:31.000]  system everything's geared to not just have that 20 30 percent that we always
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.040]  know or want to be you know sucker chumps willfully ignorant but it's an
[01:45:36.040 --> 01:45:40.880]  attempt to make the entire society that way and force you into it it's like the
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:44.560]  hoax of the TSA never caught one terrorist government got the underwear
[01:45:44.560 --> 01:45:47.800]  bomber on the plane came out congressional testimony you think the
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:52.160]  zombies that go to Black Friday know that do you think they know that I mean
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:56.040]  it's incredible a few times over the years we've needed something at the
[01:45:56.040 --> 01:46:01.680]  store and some kind of electronics for the info wars operation with all our
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:06.400]  crew and and I've gone down with the crews gone down on Black Friday and it's
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.200]  snatching and grabbing and angry people in fact I'm typically just to go down
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:13.320]  there right now and show people what's going on but you've seen it you've
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.240]  experienced it it is idiocy if you like a nice camera to take beautiful images
[01:46:18.240 --> 01:46:21.680]  because you're in love with that that's wonderful but you don't want to go get
[01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:24.920]  in a fist fight for the camera if you like a video game and like false
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:29.480]  reality that's your issue but what is this whole thing of getting obsessed
[01:46:29.480 --> 01:46:33.160]  with the fact that you've got to have it on this day and you've got to go fight
[01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:37.040]  with people that's literally what it is it's like a shark feeding frenzy
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.880]  believing there's blood in the water but it's not even a good deal it's a lot of
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.000]  other observations I'm gonna say this in closing look at China and I know it's
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.320]  almost impossible to buy a lot of stuff it's not made in China by people that
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:53.160]  have forced abortions at their factories that's in the news mobile
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:57.680]  execution vans for political dissidents look it up suicide nets around the
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:02.040]  Apple factories their subcontractors hellish stuff people think oh I'm
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:08.120]  getting a good deal when I buy all this stuff and really all you're doing is
[01:47:08.120 --> 01:47:12.600]  lowering your standard of living in your wages many all right that was Alex
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:16.880]  Jones with his Black Friday secrets revealed some very good points that he
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:20.960]  made there let me recap some of what I got out of that in in my own words
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:24.520]  because I think he's nailed it I think he's right on target that the Black
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:33.120]  Friday hype is really an artificial simulation of hunting it's it's people
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:37.160]  lining up and thinking they're going out into the wild which is the mall and
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:44.560]  that they are our overcoming competitive hunters to snatch some valuable
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:49.680]  item to bring back home to the family to to share in the spoils of their of
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:54.440]  their hunting but it's artificial the whole thing is contrived I think Alex
[01:47:54.440 --> 01:47:59.720]  called it there the what the triumph of empty materialism which is a really
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:03.600]  good that that's a good phrase to describe it because so much of what we
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.200]  have today is an artificial construct that simulates the reality we're
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:12.720]  supposed to be living in so for example sports you know a lot of people were
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.520]  watching football yesterday and nothing wrong with enjoying a game from time to
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:21.480]  time but if you really get into it and you've got the sports worshippers they
[01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:26.760]  are involved in a simulation of tribal warfare that's what the two teams
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.760]  represent and the two uniforms and you're supposed to choose one side or
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.920]  another and cheer for one side or another that is a simulation of tribalism
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.920]  we've got food at the grocery store even the grocery stores even set up kind of
[01:48:40.920 --> 01:48:47.080]  like a simulated food hunting preserve where you hunt around the store you hunt
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:53.720]  for the best deals you find let's say a can of coca-cola it is the color is red
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:59.600]  to simulate fruit and it contains the sugars that you would normally find in
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:04.120]  a piece of fruit out in the natural world so finding the coca-cola and
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:08.800]  bringing it home and drinking it is a simulation of finding fresh fruit out
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:13.560]  it out in the real world and so much of what we have today in society is people
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:19.000]  especially people who live in cities who never get out into nature I'm not
[01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:21.800]  saying everybody that lives in a city doesn't get out of nature I'm saying
[01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:25.640]  those who only limit their existence to the city they live in this artificial
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:30.680]  construct and everything to them is artificial the the shopping that the
[01:49:30.680 --> 01:49:35.080]  hunting is artificial black Friday shopping the the food is artificial food
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:39.120]  at the grocery store even the economics are artificial because they can vote
[01:49:39.120 --> 01:49:42.880]  presidents in the office that just give them more and more entitlements and
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:46.560]  handouts and goodies so they're living in an artificial economy that's only
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.080]  sustained by confiscating wealth from others who are actually out producing in
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:55.360]  the real world so one of the things that that that is most important about
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:00.760]  living in the real world is actually visiting nature is learning some
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:04.760]  gardening some farming I encourage you to get out into the country if you're not
[01:50:04.760 --> 01:50:09.640]  already live on a farm and live in the real world for a change in the real
[01:50:09.640 --> 01:50:14.640]  world where you know like the other night I had to protect my chickens from
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:19.160]  from predators out there is out there with my shotgun keeping them keeping
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:23.200]  them safe and because predators are out there trying to get them you know I had
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:28.440]  to fix the the flat tire on my John Deere tractor which is you know big big
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:31.920]  heavy tire you if you live out in the country you live in the real world and
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:35.720]  your perspective starts to change if you live in the city and you worship the
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:40.440]  city and you worship big government then it's all artificial and you fall like a
[01:50:40.440 --> 01:50:46.120]  sucker for these black Friday type of events the the hype of empty materialism
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:50.200]  as Alex said much more straight ahead stay with us we'll be right back after
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:55.160]  this break here on the Alex Jones show stay with us

[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:37.760]  been crazy out here lately with this formula one thing going on and I don't
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:41.760]  know the state troopers are going nuts out here with with given people tickets
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:47.480]  for finding alternate routes on you know they try to bypass the cars that are
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:51.200]  jammed up on the highway they try to find like another side road to go on
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.560]  they're getting ticketed for that seriously I'm not making this up guys
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:58.320]  the state I happened yesterday to some people I know state troopers giving them
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:03.400]  a ticket what does the ticket say illegal alternate route I mean what's
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:07.880]  the citation man all they did is find another way to try to get to their
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:13.200]  destination it's it's crazy I don't know I don't know why that's going on all
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:18.320]  right now in the next hour we've got a guest coming up Mike Bundrant who is an
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.760]  expert in mental health who we're gonna ask him about some of this crazy crowd
[01:55:21.760 --> 01:55:24.800]  behavior that we've seen with Black Friday and some of the things that Alex
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:28.120]  just commented on with his video we're also going to continue with your calls
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:34.800]  so stay on the line we've got Jane Jim Mike Peter Phoenix and others on the
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:38.080]  line so go ahead and stay on the line we'll get to your calls in the next hour
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:44.640]  with Mike Bundrant and between now and then I've got an issue here to share
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:50.640]  with you and that is any state in the United States this is sort of getting
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.560]  back to the secession topic that we spoke about in the first hour but any
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:00.960]  state they wanted to unleash an economic golden age of abundance could do so very
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:06.600]  simply by declaring one or two things as through the 10th amendment and saying
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:10.760]  this is our state's right to do this and one of those things I want to share
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:14.920]  with you right now and by the way I want to preface this by saying any state
[01:56:14.920 --> 01:56:19.320]  that is in debt could eliminate its debt any date that has a problem with
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:23.600]  unemployment could virtually eliminate unemployment it could become an
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:28.960]  economic mecca for America if it did these these two simple things two or
[01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:35.640]  three things one of them is legalized industrial hemp farming I'm not talking
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:41.040]  about growing marijuana to smoke I'm talking about industrial hemp farming
[01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:46.400]  like took place in this country for as long as anyone can remember until it
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:50.320]  was criminalized we're talking about states like North Carolina South
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:55.800]  Carolina Florida California Texas in fact you can grow hemp in Colorado and
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:00.080]  Oklahoma Kansas all across the Midwest all across the East Coast all across the
[01:57:00.080 --> 01:57:05.640]  West Coast Oregon Washington State even you can grow hemp everywhere if one
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:11.200]  state had the courage to say let's grow hemp let's declare let's say Texas a
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:17.120]  legal hemp farming zone that state would immediately experience a massive
[01:57:17.120 --> 01:57:23.640]  economic boom in exporting hemp to all the other states all the Texas farmers
[01:57:23.640 --> 01:57:27.720]  would experience an economic boom from having massive demand for their hemp
[01:57:27.720 --> 01:57:33.080]  look America today already buys hemp from Canada and China and Central South
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:36.960]  America lots of other places we buy hemp seeds we buy hemp fiber we buy hemp
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:42.880]  clothing we buy hemp oils why can't we grow it here all it takes is one state
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:48.240]  to stand up like Texas and say we're just gonna legalize the farming of hemp
[01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:53.120]  again as it used to be legal here in the United States and in Texas of course
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:58.040]  and then that would be that state would become the exporter and and farmers
[01:57:58.040 --> 01:58:04.320]  would be just rolling in the dough the state could tax the hemp and have
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.760]  massive influx of state money to overcome its debt and so on now the
[01:58:08.760 --> 01:58:14.480]  next idea no man these breaks come up so fast never have enough time tell you
[01:58:14.480 --> 01:58:18.920]  what after this break I'll share with you the next idea which could create an
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:23.480]  economic golden age for any state in America that decided to do it there are
[01:58:23.480 --> 01:58:28.640]  many of these ideas we're only a tenth amendment away a decision one decision
[01:58:28.640 --> 01:58:32.280]  away from making this happen to stay with us here on the Alex Jones show and
[01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:37.720]  I'll bring in that idea when we come back right after this break
[01:58:40.120 --> 01:58:48.680]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today
[01:58:50.320 --> 01:58:55.400]  we just had a terrible storm in the east but we are all still in the eye of the
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:59.360]  perfect storm we have the most devastating economic conditions since the
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:02.960]  Great Depression America's worst drought and agricultural history and what
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:07.240]  about the presidential election this perfect storm is a huge threat to
[01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:11.520]  everyone's food supply if it's direct is preparing for the shortages and you
[01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:16.040]  had better do the same I can warn you but I can't feed you you know that if
[01:59:16.040 --> 01:59:19.720]  foods is the best tasting and safest food on the planet we all need a bunch
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:23.360]  of storeable and usable food from if it's direct none of us wants to be

[02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:36.240]  you for continuing with us this is the Alex Jones show Mike Adams the health
[02:00:36.240 --> 02:00:41.360]  ranger filling in for Alex today and we are talking about a number of interesting
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:45.880]  ideas including some ideas for how any state with the courage to stand up to
[02:00:45.880 --> 02:00:51.760]  the feds could unleash an era of incredible economic abundance and it's
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:55.800]  not difficult it just takes the courage to invoke the 10th Amendment and
[02:00:55.800 --> 02:01:00.800]  legalize basic economic activity in your state and the issue that we talked
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:05.480]  about in the last segment was legalizing industrial hemp farming imagine
[02:01:05.480 --> 02:01:10.440]  if a state like Texas or North Carolina or even California legalized hemp
[02:01:10.440 --> 02:01:16.440]  farming industrial hemp it would become instantly the exporter of hemp products
[02:01:16.440 --> 02:01:22.160]  to the rest of North America and would experience a massive economic boom as a
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:26.760]  result imagine an incredible job creation incredible exports out of your
[02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:31.720]  state so why won't a state do it are they afraid of the feds are they afraid I
[02:01:31.720 --> 02:01:37.160]  think Texas is not afraid I think Texas should legalize industrial hemp
[02:01:37.160 --> 02:01:41.160]  farming so our farmers can actually you know make some money for a change instead
[02:01:41.160 --> 02:01:44.200]  of going broke by the way we've got a guest coming up in the next segment
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:48.240]  Mike Bundrant who is here to talk about some of the mental health issues
[02:01:48.240 --> 02:01:53.720]  relative to the holidays and also the madness of crowds as we just saw with
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:58.640]  Black Friday and this this crazy simulation of hunting that people go
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:05.360]  through to line up at at I don't know early hours of the night before to to
[02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:09.080]  save 50 bucks on a DVD player or whatever they're lining up for I'm not
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:14.160]  even sure exactly what they're lining up for but it can't be worth the personal
[02:02:14.160 --> 02:02:18.360]  time no way can't be worth it anyway continuing with our ideas of how states
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:22.880]  could revolutionize their economies very simply by standing up to the federal
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:27.040]  government another idea that's very simple is for a state to declare a
[02:02:27.040 --> 02:02:34.160]  itself to be a health freedom zone right a health freedom zone where for
[02:02:34.160 --> 02:02:41.000]  example practicing holistic medicine is decriminalized because right now it is
[02:02:41.000 --> 02:02:45.280]  illegal in America for example and and even in the state of Texas it is
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:50.400]  illegal for a doctor to prescribe nutritional supplements to a patient
[02:02:50.400 --> 02:02:54.000]  that's illegal did you know that they can have their license yanked it is
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.800]  illegal for an alternative cancer doctor who has a very high cure rate of
[02:02:57.800 --> 02:03:03.240]  patients to practice alternative cancer therapies in America it's illegal it's
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:08.600]  been criminalized for decades as a result all the alternative cancer
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:14.600]  treatment centers are located in Mexico and the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas
[02:03:14.600 --> 02:03:18.840]  and everywhere except America so as a result the Americans who are seeking
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:23.160]  the alternative cancer therapies such as Gerson therapy very popular and really
[02:03:23.160 --> 02:03:27.680]  works by the way they flee the United States and they take all their money and
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.240]  all their business to Mexico and the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands and so
[02:03:31.240 --> 02:03:37.440]  on why not declare a health freedom zone in a state in America and this one
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:42.160]  could be declared in a state like Oregon or New Mexico potentially or
[02:03:42.160 --> 02:03:49.000]  California or Washington State or even even North Carolina I mean any state
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:53.760]  and then it would become the medical tourism hub for the entire nation
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:59.440]  Americans would come from all over the country to come visit that state and
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:04.640]  experience health freedom and in that state it would be legal to sell raw milk
[02:04:04.640 --> 02:04:10.840]  yes you would not be arrested and thrown in jail for selling raw milk and as an
[02:04:10.840 --> 02:04:16.600]  update on that by the way Mr. James Stewart the California raw milk man 65
[02:04:16.600 --> 02:04:23.120]  years old has just been released from jail thereafter months of incarceration
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:29.760]  in Ventura County Jail and LA County Jail for the crime of distributing raw
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:36.520]  milk unpasteurized milk to customers who were gladly lining up to buy it as a
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:42.800]  wholesome food unpasteurized enzymes and intact healthier food lower rates of
[02:04:42.800 --> 02:04:46.800]  allergies when consuming that and so on so why not have a health freedom state
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:53.160]  in America and legalize healing for a change hmm there's an idea for you we'll
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:58.280]  be right back after this break with Mike Bundra and much more stay with us

[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:37.000]  I just didn't have time I did not have time to go out and actually get like a
[02:08:37.000 --> 02:08:42.200]  wild turkey which is about the only thing that I would want to eat I just
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:46.240]  this is too much going on but in any case that my neighbor got one of our wild
[02:08:46.240 --> 02:08:53.080]  turkeys so they they're happy and they they got their wild game nutrition all
[02:08:53.080 --> 02:08:56.600]  right now coming up we've got Mike Bundren here joining us he is let me
[02:08:56.600 --> 02:08:59.640]  give you the quick intro for Mike in case you're not familiar with his work
[02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:04.640]  he's the founder of the Healthy Times newspaper that has covered health
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:10.240]  freedom issues for a long a long time he's got his own online radio show
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:16.400]  called mental health exposed and his website is iNLPcenter.com where he
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:21.560]  covers a lot of linguistics and brain processing but from the point of view of
[02:09:21.560 --> 02:09:25.960]  empowering you you know with with concepts of liberty and free will so
[02:09:25.960 --> 02:09:29.280]  he's a good guy and he's he's got a lot of knowledge and he's going to comment
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:33.840]  here today on the black Friday madness of crowds that we just saw and that Alex
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:37.720]  just commented on with his video as well and some other topics Mike thank you
[02:09:37.720 --> 02:09:42.840]  for joining us and welcome to the show for having me Mike glad to be here yeah
[02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:47.600]  by the way I'm just sitting out here in California with the post prop 37 blues a
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:52.640]  little bit and a little embarrassed by our state I was so excited to vote for
[02:09:52.640 --> 02:09:59.520]  that and really shocked really shocked when it didn't pass I really thought at
[02:09:59.520 --> 02:10:03.480]  one time of California was a state that was for health and health freedom well
[02:10:03.480 --> 02:10:08.720]  Mike Mike I got to tell you the consensus is and and John Rappaport has
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:13.480]  been working on this especially that vote was stolen and that was fraud so I
[02:10:13.480 --> 02:10:18.120]  think the California voters actually voted to pass that proposition and they
[02:10:18.120 --> 02:10:23.920]  got it stolen from them by Crooks that's what happened man yeah well I and
[02:10:23.920 --> 02:10:28.080]  I've read that on your site interesting I'm gonna interview John for mental
[02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:33.200]  health exposed coming up here in the next month by the way his wife Laura
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:37.920]  yeah is a columnist for Healthy Times newspaper here in Southern California
[02:10:37.920 --> 02:10:41.640]  I didn't know that he's a health practitioner so anyway they're good
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:45.800]  people and I'm real curious to explore that issue with John yeah yeah absolutely
[02:10:45.800 --> 02:10:51.080]  it's an important issue in fact I mean you know the whole we saw Alex covered
[02:10:51.080 --> 02:10:55.800]  it here on the show with a black box voting the just the widespread voting
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:10:59.280]  fraud across the board not just with prop 37 but anyway that's not really our
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:05.720]  topic here today let's get to Black Friday mindset the the creation of the
[02:11:05.720 --> 02:11:12.040]  artificial hunting hype the madness of crowds people stampeding over each other
[02:11:12.040 --> 02:11:18.360]  to get discounts off of electronics made in China's slave shops what what is
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:25.560]  going on with modern-day North Americans humans that has driven them to
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:31.920]  this sense of warped desperation and and and social I don't know social
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:35.720]  insanity of some kind what's going on Mike yeah I gotta tell you this is an
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:41.680]  important issue and I so far this holiday season it which I haven't really
[02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:46.440]  gotten into the spirit of a great Thanksgiving yesterday with a hundred
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:52.320]  cent organic non-gmo gluten-free meal that was perhaps the best Thanksgiving
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:58.640]  meal I've ever had but at any rate we were we went to the movies last night to
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:04.480]  a late movie and we got out after midnight and driving through the shopping
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:11.560]  center on on the way home we drove past at Kmart and there were people lined up
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:18.280]  outside with their sleeping bags and little camping supplies along the
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:23.840]  sidewalk and that's when it occurred to me oh this is what this is what's going
[02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:29.200]  on I mean I it's bad and to me because what we're talking about is mass
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:36.400]  consumerism that has that really does create a frenzy and I think what's
[02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:40.480]  important to understand about that it's a couple of things one the mass
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:47.560]  consumerism was intentionally created yes intentionally created based on
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:53.400]  psychological well-thought and well-founded psychological principles
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:59.000]  that were that came from Stigman Freud I think most people don't realize that
[02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:03.360]  well one of them has got to be scarcity they create an artificial scarcity to
[02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:08.280]  create a sense of urgency right I mean that's one of their tactics right yes
[02:13:08.280 --> 02:13:14.520]  scarcity absolutely a limited supply and so forth and but I'll take us to take a
[02:13:14.520 --> 02:13:19.960]  step back even further if they when when when Stigman Freud was alive and popular
[02:13:19.960 --> 02:13:26.440]  and his ideas they were truly ground-based breaking ideas but one of
[02:13:26.440 --> 02:13:30.840]  the things one of the ideas that came out of it is that Freud revealed or he
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:38.600]  postulated at any rate that human beings have a at their core are selfish
[02:13:38.600 --> 02:13:43.640]  self-centered and potentially aggressive in other words we're animals
[02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:49.280]  inside we all have this part of ourselves which is called the id and it is
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:55.040]  potentially sexually aggressive selfish self-centered and so forth and when
[02:13:55.040 --> 02:14:00.480]  this philosophy came out it concerned government in fact a terrified government
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:06.640]  because government concerned about their own power got to thinking well what if
[02:14:06.640 --> 02:14:12.640]  the lid came off humanity and we'd have mass chaos and so they're really
[02:14:12.640 --> 02:14:18.640]  concerned about how do we get us under control right so for his nephew was a
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:24.760]  man by the name of Edward Bernays he said that the field of public relations
[02:14:24.760 --> 02:14:31.000]  and he got together with governments and large corporations to teach them how to
[02:14:31.000 --> 02:14:38.560]  tame this aggressive impulse and keep people docile by focusing on themselves
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:45.120]  and taming them with mass consumer products and good and that's how the
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:52.000]  whole age of consumerism was started it was created on purpose to keep people
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  sort of feeding their self-centeredness distracted from what's really going on
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:04.440]  and to keep them sort of tame and docile and Bernays sorry to interrupt but
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:09.600]  Bernays was a master at at getting people to believe in a essentially
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:14.280]  creating artificial demand creating desire where none should exist and this
[02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:18.520]  is especially true in for example the world of fashion and cosmetics and
[02:15:18.520 --> 02:15:23.560]  women seeing images of other women having something that they think that
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:28.720]  they're supposed to have and then doing anything to get that yes Bernays was a
[02:15:28.720 --> 02:15:35.480]  master his mantra was one thing which is to get people to want what they don't
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:42.200]  need and that is the underlying principle of modern consumerism it's to
[02:15:42.200 --> 02:15:47.400]  create demand where there isn't a need and if you look around your house how
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:53.880]  much of the stuff do you have that you know how much do you really need and so
[02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:58.000]  that's what Bernays was all about and he literally invented the field of public
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:04.560]  relations linking products and services to fame and wealth and popularity and
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:10.240]  faking credibility as one of the big things he would create fake consumer
[02:16:10.240 --> 02:16:15.320]  boards or fake medical boards that would endorse his products and how he made
[02:16:15.320 --> 02:16:20.720]  bacon and eggs the American breakfast breakfast he made a bunch of doctors and
[02:16:20.720 --> 02:16:26.680]  he sort of created this fake credibility and so much of public relations is
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:32.840]  based on that well hey yeah that's what pop 37 did they had these fake groups like
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:37.400]  the the fake police organization in California that said vote no on 37 and
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:42.400]  and you know we've got you know like today all these all these fake groups
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:47.200]  that front for the grocery manufacturers that front for tobacco that was a big
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:50.720]  case where Bernays was involved you know more doctors smoke camels than any
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:54.080]  other cigarette and those ads were running the Journal of the American
[02:16:54.080 --> 02:16:58.760]  Medical Association and yeah the example is just going on but my question to you
[02:16:58.760 --> 02:17:02.720]  though Mike is how does this Black Friday madness this kind of crowd
[02:17:02.720 --> 02:17:07.440]  psychology madness how does this serve the interests of the global elite or
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:13.000]  big government controllers why are they in in effect encouraging this to go on
[02:17:13.000 --> 02:17:18.480]  I don't I don't quite get how it serves their interests well I think if the the
[02:17:18.480 --> 02:17:26.600]  global power structure is not interested in the average consumer being a
[02:17:26.600 --> 02:17:33.960]  citizen or the average person being a citizen prior to consumerism there were
[02:17:33.960 --> 02:17:40.080]  no consumers I mean there were citizens there were workers but there weren't
[02:17:40.080 --> 02:17:45.440]  consumers and so part of the the motivation here and to work you know
[02:17:45.440 --> 02:17:50.360]  together with the large corporations and so forth part of it is to keep people
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:54.840]  distracted one of the things that one of the words they use is happy machine
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:18:02.160]  happiness machine they want to create happiness machine people who satisfy
[02:18:02.160 --> 02:18:08.440]  their desires for happiness through materialism and it keeps people
[02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:12.640]  distracted I would say that's the main thing keep people distracted from what's
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:18.800]  really going on so keep people pursuing their CD players or their plasma TVs or
[02:18:18.800 --> 02:18:23.240]  what have you they're keep people thinking this is what's important in my
[02:18:23.240 --> 02:18:27.200]  life it's just get more stuff right right so they don't pursue the real
[02:18:27.200 --> 02:18:31.960]  things that matter which is awareness and and the fundamentals of liberty and
[02:18:31.960 --> 02:18:38.240]  a quest for knowledge innovation advanced artistry all of these things that
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:41.560]  actually uplift humanity they want to keep people trapped in this mob
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:46.840]  psychology of oh I need another flat panel TV or a toaster or a DVD player
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:50.480]  and that's what's going to give me a happiness it exactly and if you ask the
[02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:56.480]  average person you and I are sitting here pondering stressing over prop 37 and
[02:18:56.480 --> 02:18:59.640]  what happened there we need to figure this out and we need to get the word
[02:18:59.640 --> 02:19:03.400]  out well most people aren't in this fight it's been interested and the average
[02:19:03.400 --> 02:19:07.600]  person is more interested at this point in the year and what they're going to get
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:10.480]  for Christmas or what they're going to give for Christmas or what have you in
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.400]  terms of things yeah in the latest TV or what happens prop 37 most people are
[02:19:15.400 --> 02:19:19.520]  going to be interested in something material that's true success on that

[02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:18.960]  time when only the president could obtain this world-class healer now 27 years
[02:20:18.960 --> 02:20:23.280]  later carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy now

[02:24:11.200 --> 02:24:18.000]  we're continuing with Mike Bundrand expert in mental health and also how
[02:24:18.000 --> 02:24:24.040]  false authority uses language to manipulate behavior of human beings
[02:24:24.040 --> 02:24:28.320]  boy that's a that's a complex field with lots of interesting things going on
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:32.680]  Mike we've only got you for this segment this this this entire segment but I
[02:24:32.680 --> 02:24:37.400]  wanted to make sure we cover holiday depression because a lot of people I
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:41.440]  mean a surprisingly large number of people feel depression during the holidays
[02:24:41.440 --> 02:24:47.080]  and what can they do to deal with that more effectively knowing what you know
[02:24:47.080 --> 02:24:54.240]  go ahead go ahead Mike yeah you bet it is very common holiday stress and depression
[02:24:54.240 --> 02:24:57.600]  there's actually been surveys by the American Psychological Association and
[02:24:57.600 --> 02:25:02.160]  some of these surveys we can count on that suggests that fifty to seventy five
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:06.040]  percent of people are affected by at least heightened stress during the
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:10.600]  holidays and there's also been some interesting research done by mental
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:17.040]  health america dot net where they have pinpointed some of the primary sources
[02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:22.080]  of holiday stress and depression and I would say the very first thing to do if
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:27.680]  this affects you is to pinpoint the source because it can come from
[02:25:27.680 --> 02:25:33.720]  different areas for example 40 percent of people who participated in the
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:36.640]  surveys three thousand people participating in the surveys done in
[02:25:36.640 --> 02:25:42.640]  2006 a couple years old but 40 percent of people said the main source of their
[02:25:42.640 --> 02:25:49.160]  holiday stress is financial and that it's relevant given our last
[02:25:49.160 --> 02:25:53.960]  conversation about you know the age of modern consumerism and the expectation
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:26:00.720]  that you give everyone a gift don't forget anyone and get them the best gift
[02:26:00.720 --> 02:26:04.000]  and look at the commercials on television and then we'll keep up with the
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:08.560]  latest trends and so forth a lot of people simply don't have the budget for
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:14.480]  it and yet they they they give into the expectation that they should spend
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.960]  even the holiday meal can be really expensive if you do it in the
[02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:24.720]  traditional way hey even if you do it organically that can be expensive too I
[02:26:24.720 --> 02:26:29.400]  know yeah what about Mike what about political tension especially this year
[02:26:29.400 --> 02:26:33.440]  I think a lot of families you know that might get together and part of the family
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:38.520]  voted for Obama and the other part voted for Romney and another part was trying
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:42.320]  to vote for Ron Paul but he you know they couldn't do that so could there be a
[02:26:42.320 --> 02:26:47.760]  lot of political tension especially this year yeah and then you know those of us
[02:26:47.760 --> 02:26:54.880]  who go well I voted for Gary Johnson and then nobody else has even heard of them
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:27:02.120]  yeah that certainly can be in fact in the survey it's actually time with family
[02:27:02.120 --> 02:27:09.320]  is one of the stressors that that people report however I was surprised by this
[02:27:09.320 --> 02:27:16.640]  only 17% of people said the time with family is part of of their holiday
[02:27:16.640 --> 02:27:20.840]  stress I would thought it would be more it would be a lot more than that and you
[02:27:20.840 --> 02:27:25.240]  know it's the thing you get together with people that are in your family that
[02:27:25.240 --> 02:27:29.960]  quite frankly you may or may not like or may or may not get along with and one of
[02:27:29.960 --> 02:27:37.200]  the things that comes up is that that old family dynamic surfaces and people are
[02:27:37.200 --> 02:27:42.200]  really affected by it I tell people look if you want to deal with your issues
[02:27:42.200 --> 02:27:46.400]  with your family the old power struggles that may still be alive in your
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:50.800]  psyche if you want to deal with those issues deal with those issues but don't
[02:27:50.800 --> 02:27:56.600]  do it during the holiday yeah deal with it do it get past the holidays in
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:03.080]  January of February maybe get an outside perspective and start to address your
[02:28:03.080 --> 02:28:07.320]  family dynamic but don't just wait for it to blow up during the holidays do it
[02:28:07.320 --> 02:28:10.720]  you can't sidestep it pretend it doesn't exist get to the holidays have a
[02:28:10.720 --> 02:28:15.000]  decent day for yourself yeah well think that that's the time you have to deal
[02:28:15.000 --> 02:28:20.800]  with you know 30 years of angst in your family yeah that's true yeah welcome home
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:24.400]  oh yeah you never supported my dreams as a child I mean that's not the way to
[02:28:24.400 --> 02:28:30.120]  walk it look at my life right I mean right not the time to do that to deal
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:34.360]  with that it's okay okay go ahead well I just want to say for those who want to
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:38.320]  learn more from from you and if you just join us we're we're interviewing Mike
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:42.280]  Bundrant here he's the founder of Healthy Times newspaper and also mental
[02:28:42.280 --> 02:28:47.880]  health expose is his audio show online radio show and I'd like to take one
[02:28:47.880 --> 02:28:52.360]  call here we've got time for we may not have time for a complete answer but
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:56.360]  let's go to Jane in Texas Jane you're on the air do you have a do you have a
[02:28:56.360 --> 02:29:01.400]  question for Mike or what's on your mind Jane no I was just me I'm you spent
[02:29:01.400 --> 02:29:06.080]  about an hour but anyway I was raised organic before the word ever came out I

[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:29.440]  described her childhood growing up on real food in America and we're gonna go
[02:33:29.440 --> 02:33:34.520]  to her and then go after that we've got Jason Burmese and Ashley Jessica joining
[02:33:34.520 --> 02:33:39.640]  us with a report on what happened to them at the airport in Albany and their
[02:33:39.640 --> 02:33:44.320]  showdown with public relations personnel I guess who are defending TSA
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:49.200]  pedophilia molestation of senior citizens and everything else that they do
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:52.720]  that should be an interesting segment don't miss that but at first let's go
[02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:57.360]  back to our our caller Jane in Texas Jane just want to give you a chance to
[02:33:57.360 --> 02:34:01.880]  finish up there any additional comments on what real food is
[02:34:01.880 --> 02:34:06.400]  cook from scratch I always have but it's getting increasingly harder to find good
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:10.960]  food I don't know what's the MO I don't know where the food comes from today
[02:34:10.960 --> 02:34:17.000]  because I grow some in my little yard but I can't depend on the stores to give
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:23.080]  me anything honestly because I even asked sprouts was there corn GMO they
[02:34:23.080 --> 02:34:28.360]  didn't know and did they and yeah well Whole Foods doesn't know I mean they
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:32.400]  their employees give you the wrong information they say they don't sell GMOs
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:37.440]  but they do and so it's extremely hard to know what you're getting and where
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:42.240]  it's coming from so it's hard and when they blame people on you know their
[02:34:42.240 --> 02:34:46.840]  lifestyle is caused by like diabetes I don't think it's all the person's
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:52.040]  fault I bet because you agree with you Jane you nailed it it is that people are
[02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:56.560]  being victimized by the food industry by the GMO industry by the vaccine industry
[02:34:56.560 --> 02:35:01.480]  by chemtrails people are being victimized by this and I want to thank
[02:35:01.480 --> 02:35:03.760]  you for your call you made you made some really good points there thanks and
[02:35:03.760 --> 02:35:07.800]  hey teach your children and your grandchildren the way that you were
[02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:11.320]  raised okay we have to keep this knowledge going from generation to
[02:35:11.320 --> 02:35:14.160]  generation because that's what we're gonna have to rely on once this whole
[02:35:14.160 --> 02:35:19.520]  artificial system that we live in today collapses implodes upon itself and that
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:23.400]  day is drawing ever closer and here to give us some reports on how that may be
[02:35:23.400 --> 02:35:28.280]  happening in the realm of surveillance and security and police state tyranny is
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:34.000]  none other than Jason Burmese and joined by Ashley Jessica and Jason of
[02:35:34.000 --> 02:35:40.480]  course is working with the Intel hub.com on his new film and he just had a not
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:46.760]  quite an altercation but let's say a an event with TSA and Albany Jason welcome
[02:35:46.760 --> 02:35:50.640]  to the Alex Jones show once again how you doing today I'm doing well thanks for
[02:35:50.640 --> 02:35:54.760]  having me Ashley on yeah thanks for joining us today tell us what what went
[02:35:54.760 --> 02:35:59.860]  down why don't I let Ashley start because you know we went out there and she
[02:35:59.860 --> 02:36:03.760]  started this campaign and quite frankly Mike it's kind of disheartening that
[02:36:03.760 --> 02:36:08.720]  somebody who's a Canadian citizen is out there more than you US citizens out
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:11.800]  there but if you're gonna walk or talk to talk you've got to walk the walk and
[02:36:11.800 --> 02:36:16.040]  this girl has done it and she'll start you off all right go go for it Ashley
[02:36:16.040 --> 02:36:21.680]  hi Mike okay so basically we were at the right front of the TSA checkpoint at
[02:36:21.680 --> 02:36:26.000]  Albany International Airport Jason was filming I was handing out flyers to the
[02:36:26.000 --> 02:36:32.040]  travelers coming up the escalator within about seven minutes I would say
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:37.960]  airport personnel and two sheriffs came up the escalator well the sheriff's led
[02:36:37.960 --> 02:36:41.160]  us along in the beginning they didn't they weren't there essentially the
[02:36:41.160 --> 02:36:45.400]  media personnel came up yeah man did we go downstairs and stop filming right
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:49.640]  there yeah and I said to him look we had it off the TSA's website that we were
[02:36:49.640 --> 02:36:53.840]  more than allowed to film we made the comment that this was in a national
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:58.720]  out on film week that had been covered by not only info wars.com and I made it
[02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:01.800]  known as the number one alternative news site in the world the Alex Jones show
[02:37:01.800 --> 02:37:06.120]  the number one internet radio program on over a hundred affiliates and I said you
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:09.400]  know drudge is covered this the Huffington Post on the left is covered
[02:37:09.400 --> 02:37:13.040]  this we've had local affiliates cover this we absolutely have the right to be
[02:37:13.040 --> 02:37:17.000]  here so he immediately said he was going to call a sheriff over and I said I
[02:37:17.000 --> 02:37:20.360]  encourage that that's fine so the sheriffs came over and they started
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:23.720]  talking to me and I said you know I'll come downstairs with you guys that's
[02:37:23.720 --> 02:37:26.800]  fine but I'm not gonna stop filming I absolutely have that right and through
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:30.000]  the whole thing the media relation no you don't you need a million dollar
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:33.720]  insurance policy I'm not giving you a little I'm saying sir you have federal
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:37.640]  employees here you have no choice this is our right to do so so as usual their
[02:37:37.640 --> 02:37:41.640]  media relations personnel was completely misinformed spouting a bunch of lies
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:47.040]  and trying to scare you into doing something into not doing something that
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:50.360]  you had the right to do which was the film absolutely and this isn't my first
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:55.840]  rodeo so I really thought I had all the information in front of me and we went
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:58.520]  downstairs with the sheriffs and after about five or ten minutes of them
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:02.600]  conversing and them talking to the CEO of the airport over the phone and then
[02:38:02.600 --> 02:38:05.360]  calling into the Albany County Sheriff's Department
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:09.160]  very bluntly the sheriff told him we can't do anything this is absolute
[02:38:09.160 --> 02:38:13.520]  absolutely constitutionally protected very not soliciting anybody they are
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:17.000]  absolutely allowed to hand out this information and the response from this
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:21.040]  gentleman was well then I'm going to shut down the whole upper side of the
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:27.680]  airport for non-ticketed passengers really and he did so and so so he
[02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:32.800]  threatened to disrupt air travel in America to stop you handing out
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:38.240]  literature peacefully to other travelers he not only threatened he did it he
[02:38:38.240 --> 02:38:43.320]  absolutely did it did it I he did yes he shut down he shut it down if you did
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:46.120]  not have a ticket you were not permitted upstairs where we were originally
[02:38:46.120 --> 02:38:49.680]  filming which is the only checkpoint at Albany you know like I said I just gone
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:55.120]  through there Wednesday evening every time I go I hopped out I've not been
[02:38:55.120 --> 02:38:57.400]  able to just go through the metal scanners they always want me to go
[02:38:57.400 --> 02:39:01.520]  through the body scanners I have to take these pat downs and the ignorance of
[02:39:01.520 --> 02:39:05.880]  these TSA agents parroting the same line that it's no worse than your cell phone
[02:39:05.880 --> 02:39:09.960]  radiation are you going to tell me that a four inch device in my pocket gives off
[02:39:09.960 --> 02:39:16.360]  the same level of millimeter waves or radiation of an eight foot by three foot
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:20.800]  device that takes a picture of my body it's absolutely no they've been
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:24.200]  completely lied to about that they're just spouting disinformation I bet they
[02:39:24.200 --> 02:39:27.360]  didn't even know that their machines have never been independently tested
[02:39:27.360 --> 02:39:32.760]  or certified by anyone as being safe at all and that the TSA refuses to subject
[02:39:32.760 --> 02:39:35.840]  the machines to that kind of independent testing because they obviously know the
[02:39:35.840 --> 02:39:39.400]  results are going to be hey these machines give you cancer and that's
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:44.400]  absolutely correct so in frustration he shuts down the entire top people that
[02:39:44.400 --> 02:39:47.160]  were you know trying to help their family members or pick somebody up were
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:51.600]  being sent down the escalator he tried to disrupt us by saying we were blocking
[02:39:51.600 --> 02:39:55.480]  the escalator when even going down the escalator is like you're blocking the
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:58.920]  flow of traffic because we were just handing out we decided we're just
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:40:01.720]  going to stand at the bottom of the escalator and had a fliers there
[02:40:01.720 --> 02:40:05.760]  however the sheriff stood there the entire time he was very pleasant we
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:10.400]  conversed with him again and again and again this media relations person and I
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:13.840]  want to give out the number so you can call yeah give it out at the airport and
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:19.280]  let them know that we are allowed to film and that his actions are absolutely
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:29.440]  insane and that number is 518-242-2200 or 2222 and I'm encouraging listeners to
[02:40:29.440 --> 02:40:34.440]  please call them with your displeasure of how misinformed and uninformed this
[02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:38.360]  gentleman is now this this media relations person he was an employee of
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:44.520]  the airport or of the TSA no he he was an employee of the airport and he said
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:48.200]  there were no TSA personnel downstairs which was a complete and total lie
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:54.280]  and escalator to try again to make us stop filming and I said to him look man
[02:40:54.280 --> 02:40:57.960]  this is completely legal and every time he went to the police officer well you
[02:40:57.960 --> 02:41:01.440]  make sure they don't leave and the police officer said I can't detain these
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:05.000]  people they haven't done anything wrong he's like well I want to see his ID he
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:11.600]  said sir I can't even ask him for his ID he is not committed to crime so the
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:15.760]  sheriff's know what they're talking about there absolutely awesome
[02:41:15.760 --> 02:41:19.880]  emails they need thanks you know don't disrupt them too much but if you people

[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:27.920]  emails thank them for doing their job because they did their job this person
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:33.200]  was informed he followed the law the entire there was the sheriff yeah it's
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:36.800]  even a time I mean this guy was so disheveled with the fact that we had a
[02:41:36.800 --> 02:41:41.080]  camera and we're letting people in on this information was about 50-50 who
[02:41:41.080 --> 02:41:44.720]  were receptive Mike you know did he have I gotta ask you though did he have kind
[02:41:44.720 --> 02:41:49.120]  of a demonic glow in his eyes did he did he did he growl and want to take you
[02:41:49.120 --> 02:41:53.600]  to the private TSA rape room and have his way with you a room to fill out a
[02:41:53.600 --> 02:41:58.400]  form in which I was going to get a permit to film there and I said I don't

[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.960]  this is where you can find my work I'm encouraging people yeah he then asked me
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:15.120]  for my address I said I don't have to give you my address what do you think
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:20.920]  this is like show me your papers is Nazi Germany or Stasi let me give out the
[02:42:20.920 --> 02:42:28.160]  number again for those who want that that's 518-242-2200 again 518-242-2200
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:32.680]  and that is the number of the airport or the the public relations relations
[02:42:32.680 --> 02:42:37.840]  department at Albany International Airport got it and and again Mike we
[02:42:37.840 --> 02:42:41.120]  were not being disruptive and the sheriff's picked up on that right away I
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:46.160]  had a long conversation with him it was really interesting it was actually very
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:50.160]  heartening to me that the cops did the right thing awesome because I fully went
[02:42:50.160 --> 02:42:54.000]  there expecting that there might be some kind of an altercation and he simply
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:58.160]  said to me you know try not to escalate this and I said you know I've been very
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:01.360]  very polite to you and this gentleman even though he's being abrasive and I
[02:43:01.360 --> 02:43:04.880]  will continue to do so I go if you suspect me of anything you let me know
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:08.200]  and I'm gonna cooperate well but do you also see the contradiction in that
[02:43:08.200 --> 02:43:14.960]  whole thing like you are supposed to be polite but the TSA is committing crimes
[02:43:14.960 --> 02:43:19.360]  pedophilia crimes against our children that's not polite so they can do
[02:43:19.360 --> 02:43:23.600]  anything but you have to stay in this box of politeness that's the message and
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:26.960]  and you did stay in that box of politeness and that's probably why you
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:30.080]  know they didn't drag you out of there but but isn't it isn't that double
[02:43:30.080 --> 02:43:33.600]  standard just incredible it's an absolute double standard but you
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:38.720]  essentially take the power away from them by being informed and not being rude
[02:43:38.720 --> 02:43:42.160]  this guy's gonna look like the villain on the video because he is you know there
[02:43:42.160 --> 02:43:46.480]  was also another point where he came up and he took a stack of my flyers as if
[02:43:46.480 --> 02:43:50.640]  it was his property and I didn't even have to say anything and the sheriff
[02:43:50.640 --> 02:43:53.680]  immediately said hey you know if you want to go over something with the flyer
[02:43:53.680 --> 02:43:57.200]  with me you can have one of them but you need to put the rest of them back
[02:43:57.200 --> 02:44:06.640]  trying to steal your flyers yeah it gets better you know we left on our own
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.000]  reconnaissance after I had filmed for you know gotten about an hour of film we
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:13.360]  stayed there for about two hours handing out flyers because I had some fire
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:17.320]  engaged engagements later in the afternoon and to do this show and on our
[02:44:17.320 --> 02:44:22.360]  way out the woman at the parking garage where you have to check out starts
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:25.840]  flagging me down and making me go into a thing and she's on the phone and then I
[02:44:25.840 --> 02:44:30.360]  hear her on the phone go his license plate number is and she took my life
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:35.080]  really yeah absolutely did gave it to this gentleman or whoever she was on the
[02:44:35.080 --> 02:44:39.160]  phone with and then she tried to apologize to me Mike she said I'm sorry
[02:44:39.160 --> 02:44:42.520]  and I looked her in the face and I said no you're not sorry I'm like you just
[02:44:42.520 --> 02:44:46.040]  took my license plate number oh yeah yeah you're in the surveillance tracking
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:50.840]  system again I know you're already there but you're in it again and that's a
[02:44:50.840 --> 02:44:54.280]  that's a form of intimidation to say oh we know who you are we want your home
[02:44:54.280 --> 02:44:57.840]  address we want your your vehicle license plate number we're going to steal
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:01.160]  your your literature that you're handing out I'm so I mean it's so childish I'm
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:04.760]  surprised he didn't try to shoot you with spit wads from a soda pop straw or
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:10.240]  something it's just so silly filming us actually you know he did come down and
[02:45:10.240 --> 02:45:14.080]  film us and he out right in my face with the camera I told him my name I
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:17.360]  spelled it out for him I said you know I hope everybody checks out our
[02:45:17.360 --> 02:45:21.640]  information and then probably during the end the last 15-20 minutes we were
[02:45:21.640 --> 02:45:26.440]  there the sheriff came up to us yet again and he talked to us and he asked me my
[02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:28.840]  information if I was willing to give that up and I said you know you've been
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:32.080]  extra polite with me I'm like I would really like you to check out my
[02:45:32.080 --> 02:45:36.480]  information and I gave him my email address my name I even gave him my phone
[02:45:36.480 --> 02:45:40.200]  number and told him to call me if you'd like he had also agreed not to share that
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:46.920]  information with the man from public relations. Excellent, excellent. He asked me if I had an ID. I said yes sir I
[02:45:46.920 --> 02:45:50.760]  absolutely have identification however unless I've committed a crime or you
[02:45:50.760 --> 02:45:54.200]  suspect me of so I'm going to keep that in my pocket and he said that's fine.
[02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:58.280]  Wow. He said he asked for her information and she said she was not
[02:45:58.280 --> 02:46:02.160]  comfortable with giving it to him they left her alone. All right now where can people
[02:46:02.160 --> 02:46:05.960]  watch this video I assume you're probably editing this video compilation at
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:09.480]  this right now or after this? I gotta tell you I'm a little busy over the next
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:13.240]  couple days and I did so on HDD tape which I know is now ancient but it was my
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:18.240]  more professional camera so you know on Sunday I plan on a login transferring it
[02:46:18.240 --> 02:46:21.320]  I'll have an hour then I'm going to probably edit it down to about 10 or 15
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:25.160]  minutes and people can either check it out through my Twitter feed at Jason
[02:46:25.160 --> 02:46:30.360]  Bermas or over at my YouTube channel JasonJustice911 but you you can be
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:34.400]  sure within the next week it will be posted and shared. Okay JasonJustice911
[02:46:34.400 --> 02:46:38.880]  that's your YouTube channel. Yes. Okay got it. Now the next question for both of
[02:46:38.880 --> 02:46:42.320]  you then is what was the reaction of the other air travelers when they were
[02:46:42.320 --> 02:46:47.760]  handed this this literature by you did they did any of them supported did they
[02:46:47.760 --> 02:46:52.000]  read it what do they do? I would say about half were pretty intrigued by it
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:56.920]  they were interested they some people even thanked us for handing it out for
[02:46:56.920 --> 02:47:00.240]  standing up for travelers rights and then about another half I would say
[02:47:00.240 --> 02:47:04.680]  didn't really care but they're gonna but at the same time we didn't have a pilot
[02:47:04.680 --> 02:47:08.000]  come up to us and he was well informed he's like a lot of people don't know
[02:47:08.000 --> 02:47:11.960]  that this breaks constitutional boundaries and he was traveling but he was
[02:47:11.960 --> 02:47:15.480]  clearly a pilot and there was another point where you know a couple of the
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:20.600]  people behind the US Airways kiosk there they wanted to know what was going on
[02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:23.840]  Ashley went and shared the information and we talked to them some of it off
[02:47:23.840 --> 02:47:27.040]  camera and one of the things one of the gentlemen said to me is we all know that
[02:47:27.040 --> 02:47:33.120]  the TSA is smoke and mirrors and that kind of took me aback. He admitted the TSA was
[02:47:33.120 --> 02:47:37.280]  smoke and mirrors you know I even had a conversation with that sheriff saying you
[02:47:37.280 --> 02:47:40.560]  know they're looking into privatized security and I said well I would much
[02:47:40.560 --> 02:47:45.360]  rather have privatized security than an administration that is out of control
[02:47:45.360 --> 02:47:49.440]  has a two-week training program and essentially pays their workers a little
[02:47:49.440 --> 02:47:54.800]  more than minimum wage because that's not what we need for safety money. Yeah well
[02:47:54.800 --> 02:47:58.160]  this this kind of activism that you're you're just engaged in that you're
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:01.680]  sharing with us here this is what America needs obviously but at a much
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:06.320]  larger scale do you get a sense that there that people are fed up enough
[02:48:06.320 --> 02:48:12.320]  with the TSA that there could be some kind of a viral breakout of disobedience
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:17.200]  or handing out literature or opting out or filming like you did what's what's
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:21.280]  the consensus from being there live in person. Here's the deal Mike we believe
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:25.920]  that this opt-out film week needs to go further than this you know so many times
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:31.000]  Mike on the forums on the message boards people say oh you're just talking
[02:48:31.000 --> 02:48:35.240]  about things you're not really doing it. Well let me tell you something this
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:39.120]  doesn't have to be just this week if you are listening to this program right now
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:44.220]  whether it's live or on a replay you too can spend a couple hours out of your
[02:48:44.220 --> 02:48:48.480]  weekend doing the same thing we've done and if there is enough grounds well
[02:48:48.480 --> 02:48:53.800]  every single weekend a major airport is hit by people handing out this
[02:48:53.800 --> 02:48:59.160]  information filming the TSA we will have an effect more and more people will
[02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:03.360]  start taking notice and this is a great way for you to get active this is an
[02:49:03.360 --> 02:49:07.600]  issue that does affect all of us who travel let me commend you Mike because
[02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:12.480]  you really put out one of the best viral videos out there that uses humor to
[02:49:12.480 --> 02:49:16.600]  make people aware of what the TSA does and that's a huge thing you know humor
[02:49:16.600 --> 02:49:21.120]  reaches across all boundaries all political spectrums and that's what we
[02:49:21.120 --> 02:49:25.080]  need so I'm calling on all you people out there that don't think info wars
[02:49:25.080 --> 02:49:29.960]  does enough Jason Burmese doesn't do enough Mike Adams Alex Jones you can
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:36.640]  do this it is absolutely legal be armed with a printout of the TSA gov site
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:41.560]  where they say that you can film at these checkpoints be very aware of what
[02:49:41.560 --> 02:49:45.240]  your rights are and I would say kill them with kindness you know if you guys
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:49.240]  want to act inappropriately if they want to act childlike if they want to lie to
[02:49:49.240 --> 02:49:56.720]  us let us do so but get it on film never stop recording and well said stand
[02:49:56.720 --> 02:50:02.840]  your ground reassert your rights be polite don't escalate you know violence
[02:50:02.840 --> 02:50:06.280]  or arguments or anything like that but what what has really struck me about
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:11.600]  your experience there Jason is the the contrast between the local sheriffs and
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:16.120]  the sheriff's deputies actually abiding by the law understanding the boundaries
[02:50:16.120 --> 02:50:22.160]  of authority versus the TSA which knows no boundaries they have no respect for
[02:50:22.160 --> 02:50:27.000]  any law they invent the rules as they go along they violate federal law every
[02:50:27.000 --> 02:50:32.400]  second of every day by you know molesting travelers the TSA is out of
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:37.440]  control respects no law whatsoever and it is a danger to the future of America
[02:50:37.440 --> 02:50:41.280]  and I want your comments on that Jason and Ashley when we come back right after
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:45.200]  this break so if you'll stay with us I'll ask for your comments on that so

[02:54:14.120 --> 02:54:19.560]  Burmus and Ashley Jessica who both join us by Skype after their encounter with
[02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:24.680]  the airport media relations person in Albany as they were handing out TSA
[02:54:24.680 --> 02:54:29.720]  awareness literature or let's say air travelers rights literature and filming
[02:54:29.720 --> 02:54:35.720]  it and boy turn on a camera that freaked out the airport media relations
[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:41.520]  person who turned out to be a very threatening and childish individual so
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:46.960]  so Jason and Ashley continuing with the question I asked you before the break
[02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:50.720]  about the lawlessness of the TSA and the airport personnel
[02:54:50.720 --> 02:54:54.680]  don't it what are your thoughts on that and isn't it amazing that it's gotten to
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:55:01.280]  this point it is amazing it's amazing how how so many people who work there
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:05.960]  don't even know what the TSA regulations are and they don't even care at all
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:09.680]  that's why I think everyone when they do go they need to have that printout with
[02:55:09.680 --> 02:55:14.000]  them so that you can show the airport personnel that you are allowed to film
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:19.200]  at the TSA checkpoints because they seem to think that you are not and they use
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:24.320]  that talking point to intimidate my amazement is in the ignorance of
[02:55:24.320 --> 02:55:29.720]  their workers Mike you know I just flew in from LAX on Wednesday and you know I
[02:55:29.720 --> 02:55:34.240]  got to the body scanner I said I was going to opt out the first thing out of
[02:55:34.240 --> 02:55:40.040]  them the amount is it's just like cell phone radiation and a second person
[02:55:40.040 --> 02:55:45.840]  parroted that and I said no it no it's not he then shushed me with his hands
[02:55:45.840 --> 02:55:51.440]  22 year old 23 year old gentleman if I can even call him that I then went
[02:55:51.440 --> 02:55:55.280]  through the process of course my bag needed to be screened for explosive
[02:55:55.280 --> 02:56:01.080]  material twice twice Mike and they broke one of my tripods did I get compensated
[02:56:01.080 --> 02:56:05.040]  for that no I didn't I didn't get an apology I was just sent on my way I'm
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:08.240]  surprised I didn't steal your gear and sell it on eBay that's what they're
[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:11.640]  really well that's why I don't check luggage you know I bring two backpacks
[02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:16.760]  full of gear and it never leaves my site I'm not going to allow the TSA to
[02:56:16.760 --> 02:56:21.760]  rifle through anything that's not in my view but you know getting back Mike to
[02:56:21.760 --> 02:56:27.600]  what we can do we need to have this campaign go on beyond this week like I
[02:56:27.600 --> 02:56:31.920]  said every single weekend some of you people have an hour some of you have
[02:56:31.920 --> 02:56:36.800]  to and look at where it's gone Mike it started with taking your shoes off take
[02:56:36.800 --> 02:56:43.120]  off your jacket no liquids no lighters metal detector radiation scanner
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:48.480]  millimeter scanner now scanners plus invasive body searches and freeze don't
[02:56:48.480 --> 02:56:56.360]  forget freeze yes just keep going and going and going and if we do not pull
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:57:01.520]  it back now it is going to be full body cavity searches I guarantee it within the
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:05.880]  next five years and then maybe some people will wake up that have but we
[02:57:05.880 --> 02:57:10.320]  don't want to get there like we want to pull it back because even if you believe
[02:57:10.320 --> 02:57:15.840]  all the propaganda the propaganda states Mike they have got zero terrorist after
[02:57:15.840 --> 02:57:21.240]  9-11 that's after the shoe regulations right body scanners that's after the new
[02:57:21.240 --> 02:57:27.240]  millimeter wave scanner it's zero zero zero so if you can tell me that somehow
[02:57:27.240 --> 02:57:31.320]  this makes me safe without going after the quote-unquote target group of
[02:57:31.320 --> 02:57:34.840]  terrorists that work under every bed I don't know know how you can stand there
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:38.560]  with a straight face and try to justify these actions no they should just put a
[02:57:38.560 --> 02:57:43.480]  big sign over the airport now that says a logic-free zone if you walk in and you
[02:57:43.480 --> 02:57:51.240]  say the TSA 1 plus 1 equals 2 you get molested just for having logic I just
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:56.520]  want to say that we need to do something about this now because one day we may not
[02:57:56.520 --> 02:58:00.840]  have the chance to resist tyranny and stand up to what's going on like Jason
[02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:05.120]  was saying if we let it get to that point folks if a young Canadian girl can
[02:58:05.120 --> 02:58:10.800]  spearhead a campaign in the United States that literally shakes the TSA on
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:16.080]  every level and shake their authority you can too and you need to get out there
[02:58:16.080 --> 02:58:19.960]  and join well said Jason Burmese and Ashley Jessica thank you both for your
