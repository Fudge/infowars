[01:14.280 --> 01:22.840]  we are going to be going over all of the top stories that are up on info wars dot com and
[01:22.840 --> 01:30.280]  prison planet dot com and this one is a doozy and it's hiding in plain view like it's no
[01:30.280 --> 01:43.680]  big deal military says no presidential authorization needed to quell civil disturbances now did
[01:43.680 --> 01:50.680]  you hear that now they made movies like Dr. Strangelove just about the power to nuke being
[01:50.680 --> 01:55.520]  taken away from Congress which is a violation of the war powers and transferred into the
[01:55.520 --> 02:02.080]  quote president and then into a decapitation program where the president the top cabinet
[02:02.080 --> 02:09.680]  were wiped out only under that emergency under nuclear attack would the launch codes
[02:09.680 --> 02:15.760]  be given to generals and then general jack T. Ripper launches a biffy to strike on Russia
[02:15.760 --> 02:20.600]  and of course there was really a plan are under another name that was really going on in nineteen
[02:20.600 --> 02:31.360]  sixty two sixty three that's why Stanley Kubrick made the film in sixty four a real classic
[02:31.360 --> 02:38.640]  with group captain mandrake and George C. Scott all of it truly amazing well now they're
[02:38.640 --> 02:45.240]  saying hey we don't need the president for for massive civil unrest if it breaks out
[02:45.240 --> 02:49.960]  in America authorizes well what does that mean and then who's authorizing that and this
[02:49.960 --> 02:58.680]  is just like we have NATO this is just like we have NATO via the joint chief saying we
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.320]  get authorization for Libya Syria you name it from NATO that's where the president is
[03:03.320 --> 03:06.200]  his authorization he doesn't need it from Congress because Congress is the one that
[03:06.200 --> 03:10.960]  levies war levies taxes power the purse because it's the most diversified group of hundreds
[03:10.960 --> 03:15.600]  of people this is our constitution and then the president wants a war bill is given or
[03:15.600 --> 03:23.080]  authorization for military force is given and directed he then executes why he's called
[03:23.080 --> 03:29.000]  a executive it's like the quarterback the coaching staff gives him the order and it's
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.920]  got to be constitutional it's got to be in the rules the referees are kind of like the
[03:33.920 --> 03:41.320]  courts okay so the Congress calls the plays the quarterback executes well now they get
[03:41.320 --> 03:45.080]  now the quarterback goes you know what there's another team I'm not going to tell you even
[03:45.080 --> 03:50.040]  who they are you know it's just a NATO board they tell me what plays to play and what I
[03:50.040 --> 03:55.800]  can do they're my boss even though they don't pay your paycheck and then now the military
[03:55.800 --> 04:01.480]  is the players they're going you know what we don't even need the president anymore
[04:01.480 --> 04:06.040]  so basically it's a bunch of rogue out of control government and this could allow criminal
[04:06.040 --> 04:11.040]  elements in the national security system the stage nuclear attacks you name it in the US
[04:11.040 --> 04:18.640]  and kill the president there's a reason they've never allowed in Rome 2,000 years ago with
[04:18.640 --> 04:24.240]  Caesar or here or in England anywhere there's a reason they've never let the military launch
[04:24.240 --> 04:31.480]  attacks on its own because it will always always look at Latin America look at Africa
[04:31.480 --> 04:36.560]  look at Asia look at Europe's history they will always launch an attack on the government
[04:36.560 --> 04:44.640]  and take over with a criminal group and now they now with this announcement they can kill
[04:44.640 --> 04:51.680]  the Congress they could nuke DC say during a state of the union kill everybody have taught
[04:51.680 --> 04:56.040]  group of generals like Vici French for the Nazis and roll him on the takeover they tried
[04:56.040 --> 05:02.200]  that with Smedley Butler but he blew the whistle on him in the last two years alone the US
[05:02.200 --> 05:07.840]  has seen huge losses to our food supply in 2011 storms and floods raged across the US
[05:07.840 --> 05:12.240]  costing us 20 billion and lost crops alone in 2012 we saw the largest drought in the

[08:59.560 --> 09:06.800]  is entering its final preparations right now the public is in a narcissistic catatonic
[09:06.800 --> 09:13.440]  brainwave system very close to sleepwalking and the new world order is moving forward
[09:13.440 --> 09:20.400]  with their entire takeover program there are still large portions of the public that are
[09:20.400 --> 09:28.680]  awake and still conscious but we are in a crisis of biblical proportions for this species
[09:28.680 --> 09:36.840]  right now and for our entire future there is news up on info wars dot com and prison
[09:36.840 --> 09:46.020]  planet dot com the auxiliary site you can't get info wars dot com that is bone chilling
[09:46.020 --> 09:53.080]  when you tie it into the historical ramifications of it and the way it's just being put out
[09:53.080 --> 10:04.160]  there like it's no big deal military says no presidential authorization needed to quell
[10:04.160 --> 10:12.640]  civil disturbances d o d instruction like the d o d instructed cody wilson not to put
[10:12.640 --> 10:21.880]  up the plans for a 380 caliber single shot plastic handgun this is the way the new system
[10:21.880 --> 10:34.920]  works d o d instruction seeks to abolish posse common taught us grease skids for military
[10:34.920 --> 10:41.760]  coup and i agree with this article i worked on this article with paul watson this morning
[10:41.760 --> 10:48.400]  a recent notice now is just an instruction like the rs gives an instruction no court
[10:48.400 --> 10:54.680]  no jury we're going to take your bank account or major banks just take your house even though
[10:54.680 --> 10:58.720]  it's paid for a decade ago and they never had the deed that matter the courts do what
[10:58.720 --> 11:04.360]  they're told in that case they do go to court and take your house they can take whatever
[11:04.360 --> 11:09.240]  they want because they have the men with the guns and the political power goes out of a
[11:09.240 --> 11:17.160]  barrel of a gun and nobody's going to ask why breast cancer is exploding in the western
[11:17.160 --> 11:22.680]  world to thousands of percentile points what it was 50 years ago we're just going to say
[11:22.680 --> 11:28.320]  well we're going to start removing women's breast at puberty that'll be the new thing
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.600]  and then pretty soon we want to be able to live past five or six without massive medical
[11:33.600 --> 11:37.800]  intervention and no one will ask why are we all dying of cancer why are we all have autism
[11:37.800 --> 11:41.880]  why is everybody getting to secular cancer why is everybody getting bone cancer gee it's
[11:41.880 --> 11:49.560]  not the gmo where all the studies say they're doing that gee it's not the hydrofluorosalic
[11:49.560 --> 11:54.960]  acid in the water no no no it's none of that let's just take our young girls in to have
[11:54.960 --> 12:02.840]  their breasts removed you can't have breasts now now enjoy that between all a and don't
[12:02.840 --> 12:11.040]  put down women support them having double mastectomies at age 12 if you don't support double mastectomies
[12:11.040 --> 12:15.960]  you don't like women if you don't like a boarding babies you don't like women this is the new
[12:15.960 --> 12:23.200]  fruits of America women with their breasts all being cut off preemptively and one in
[12:23.200 --> 12:30.400]  fifty something with autism from one in twenty five thousand and neurological disorders everywhere
[12:30.400 --> 12:34.640]  I sit there in restaurants and watch people and about half the restaurant whether somebody's
[12:34.640 --> 12:41.880]  twelve years old or sixty they've got Parkinson's type diseases and twitches people can't talk
[12:41.880 --> 12:46.520]  people can't talk to you people don't understand English people don't don't they don't see
[12:46.520 --> 12:51.120]  anything just walk around bumping into walls people are walking around falling in fountains
[12:51.120 --> 12:55.880]  people walk off cliffs now the brain waves are lowering the IQs are lowering and those
[12:55.880 --> 13:01.360]  of us that see everybody falling out around us we're the bad ones and it's going to get
[13:01.360 --> 13:07.600]  crazier and crazier and crazier and the Pentagon says they're preparing for absolute civil
[13:07.600 --> 13:11.760]  collapse and disturbance and they've got the army manuals how they're going to put you
[13:11.760 --> 13:15.320]  in the camps how they're going to take your kids how they're going to process your social
[13:15.320 --> 13:21.120]  security numbers how they're going to put the digital photos of you the work brigades
[13:21.120 --> 13:25.760]  because you know you're going to have to work when you're in the camp the forced labor they
[13:25.760 --> 13:34.880]  call it reeducation directly out of Stalinist or Maoist China and then I'm the bad one I'm
[13:34.880 --> 13:39.880]  the bad one because when somebody talks to me I listen to him I'm the bad one because
[13:39.880 --> 13:44.640]  I've read the Bill of Rights and Constitution and have studied constitutional law I'm the
[13:44.640 --> 13:54.160]  bad one because I've studied quantum mechanics I'm the bad one and it's going to get crazier
[13:54.160 --> 13:58.880]  and crazier folks you're going to see collapse of civilization you know sometimes I hear
[13:58.880 --> 14:04.880]  all the fear-mongering ads on this radio network and you know what and I think man that just
[14:04.880 --> 14:08.880]  sounds crazy but then I go well I guess you know for the awake people that's who listens
[14:08.880 --> 14:13.080]  to this show and I guess I'm getting all this stuff too you know some of it goes over the
[14:13.080 --> 14:20.480]  top like this video is going to get taken down so you better go look at it but I guess
[14:20.480 --> 14:28.280]  they are starting to pull a lot of the videos so I guess it's kind of true FM 3- yeah we'll
[14:28.280 --> 14:34.240]  put that army in term and good job guys getting that FM 3-39.40 internment and resettlement
[14:34.240 --> 14:43.480]  operations February 2010 and it says they use the term the reeducation camp how about that
[14:43.480 --> 14:46.520]  you know next they'll use the death camp and they're like well what's wrong with the death
[14:46.520 --> 14:52.240]  camp and we all fetishize the uniform and I watch the public when cops walk into place
[14:52.240 --> 14:56.320]  everyone gets scared so they have Stockholm syndrome whether the cops are good or bad
[14:56.320 --> 15:01.120]  everyone gets scared and the cops sit there looking at everybody look everybody's scared
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.760]  of me and people come over and bow and like like like you know chimpanzees they go up
[15:06.760 --> 15:14.080]  to the head chimpanzee and bow before it and I mean it's just like and you're all going
[15:14.080 --> 15:18.520]  to get what you want you're going to get the cancer the neurological disorders all of it
[15:18.520 --> 15:24.240]  you want death you know it hit me we've killed something like 53 million babies now in this
[15:24.240 --> 15:32.960]  country via Roe v. Wade 53 mil but they're not humans so now they're saying they're
[15:32.960 --> 15:38.200]  going to kill babies up to age three we went out yesterday in 15 minutes and talked to
[15:38.200 --> 15:45.240]  30 people 20 of them around number jacarys gone over the video merit tonight or tomorrow
[15:45.240 --> 15:49.320]  20 of them wouldn't talk to us the 10 that did in 15 minutes because that's the drill
[15:49.320 --> 15:56.880]  you got 15 minutes talk to people four of the 10 that would talk to us or 40 percent
[15:56.880 --> 16:01.480]  we said now we're going to kill children up to age three if the parents have trouble taking
[16:01.480 --> 16:08.080]  care of them or the state wants to post birth abortion and they said yes I support that
[16:08.080 --> 16:14.080]  one woman had her kids with her with them holding her hands okay we're going to kill
[16:14.080 --> 16:19.680]  kids it's it's it's for a woman's right to choose she's like my right to choose well
[16:19.680 --> 16:28.120]  yeah yeah I do an evil laugh because it makes me sick I can actually look into that world
[16:28.120 --> 16:32.400]  in the New World Order and it makes me want to throw up and it makes me want to run to
[16:32.400 --> 16:36.920]  the South Pacific into the most primitive island I can find that's got like one fishing
[16:36.920 --> 16:43.960]  village it makes me want to get my kids and my wife and haul but out of here so fast but
[16:43.960 --> 16:48.080]  you know what there's no running it's it's going to be worldwide there it is daughters
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.720]  you have the right to kill unwanted or disabled babies at birth as they are not a real person
[16:51.720 --> 16:55.720]  claims Oxford academic well that's nothing look at the Journal of Bioethics last year
[16:55.720 --> 16:59.600]  no one believed us on this for a week they said kill kids up to age three who are even

[24:30.720 --> 24:35.720]  is a winning attribute and who think going along with things is a good idea and who are
[24:35.720 --> 24:40.920]  so intellectually lazy that they're not aware of what's going on I mean the government is
[24:40.920 --> 24:51.000]  gearing up for total and absolute societal collapse and we are sitting here right in
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.880]  the middle of this and then we try to point it out and we're the bad guys look at this
[24:57.880 --> 25:04.960]  article look at this headline military says no presidential authorization needed to quell
[25:04.960 --> 25:12.840]  civil disturbances doD instruction seeks to abolish posse commentatus grease skids for
[25:12.840 --> 25:19.040]  military coup a recent department of defense instruction alters just an instruction that's
[25:19.040 --> 25:23.280]  all you need maybe they'll instruct you to jump off a cliff you'll have to do it alters
[25:23.280 --> 25:30.560]  the U.S. code applying to the military's involvement in domestic law enforcement by allowing U.S.
[25:30.560 --> 25:36.600]  troops to quote quell civil disturbances that's a quote domestically without any presidential
[25:36.600 --> 25:43.000]  authorization see first there's no Congress needed totally unconstitutional then NATO's
[25:43.000 --> 25:49.880]  the boss and the president's the boss then oh with the military now what's the number
[25:49.880 --> 26:00.040]  one threat in history to take over a sovereign system military what are you anti military
[26:00.040 --> 26:11.160]  Caesar did good bringing in the military taking over I like the Latin American coup d'etats
[26:11.160 --> 26:20.920]  from our Lord's coffee I mean this is this is just so out of control greasing the skids
[26:20.920 --> 26:26.560]  for the de facto military coup in America along with the wholesale abolition of posse
[26:26.560 --> 26:31.560]  commentatus I mean it was a big deal when they created plans if there was a nuclear
[26:31.560 --> 26:37.880]  attack that took out Congress and the president to let a general respond and they have gone
[26:37.880 --> 26:43.760]  back and forth allowing that in U.S. code law now you've got the executive telling Congress
[26:43.760 --> 26:50.480]  you can't see PDD 51 you can't see our civil unrest plans that's classified they tell the
[26:50.480 --> 26:55.000]  armed services committee and the national security committee and they tell the homeland
[26:55.000 --> 27:01.800]  security committee that I mean that's Congress the power of the purse that's the bosses of
[27:01.800 --> 27:07.480]  this that's the football coaches who then give the executor the president the quarterback
[27:07.480 --> 27:15.160]  but now it's not even the quarterback taking over now the players and again the Congress
[27:15.160 --> 27:19.640]  they're all going along with well the military can deal with the American people if something
[27:19.640 --> 27:24.200]  happens to the president there's not even a discussion of chain of command secretary
[27:24.200 --> 27:29.400]  of state you know vice president secretary of state speaker of the house on down the
[27:29.400 --> 27:35.680]  line now it's just that we don't even need that it's the military and the military says
[27:35.680 --> 27:39.120]  and we've got to get these clips from last year and play them today if we can I just
[27:39.120 --> 27:44.520]  thought of this when they said no we got orders from NATO now so this actually is a NATO coup
[27:44.520 --> 27:52.360]  over America just like in Ireland and in Greece and in Italy they go oh we just appoint the
[27:52.360 --> 27:57.680]  leaders now the finance ministers the presidents the prime ministers from Goldman Sachs we don't
[27:57.680 --> 28:02.680]  have elections anymore we just appoint the emergency restructuring and as a technocrat
[28:02.680 --> 28:13.560]  you know bankers know best you signed on to our debt now we say you're in debt
[28:13.560 --> 28:19.400]  and the average person doesn't know the three branches of government they sure don't know
[28:19.400 --> 28:26.800]  what this is and man they say they're gearing up in this for collapse civil unrest and then
[28:26.800 --> 28:33.920]  it references of course the new army manuals that are three years old the deal with reeducation
[28:33.920 --> 28:37.880]  camps folks they actually call them that how they're going to interrogate us how they're
[28:37.880 --> 28:41.960]  going to break up our families I mean my god they're gonna start it they're gonna come
[28:41.960 --> 28:46.960]  after everybody just like you're telling state police all over the country prepare to confiscate
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.840]  Christians guns and let me tell you the average public will follow orders the average person
[28:51.840 --> 28:56.960]  if they told them I'm not joking here bring your five-year-old for execution the average
[28:56.960 --> 29:06.440]  American would do it I mean let me tell you I'm about to throw up and and you know I try
[29:06.440 --> 29:11.920]  to take more time off I can't do it and this is driving me to the point of just pulling
[29:11.920 --> 29:22.240]  my hair out because we need to be repenting folks and on our knees before God and we need
[29:22.240 --> 29:27.280]  to be at the city councils the county commissioners the state houses the street corners we should
[29:27.280 --> 29:32.240]  be running around like our hair is on fire over this but we're not it's like okay more

[31:08.320 --> 31:13.120]  led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[31:13.120 --> 31:18.000]  united states and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[33:09.960 --> 33:26.840]  to Alex Jones live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[33:39.960 --> 33:43.680]  Alright ladies and gentlemen I want to go to your phone calls and get to the news I'm
[33:43.680 --> 33:51.080]  going to get to all the ongoing Obama scandals the next hour take your calls on that as well
[33:51.080 --> 33:59.640]  it's just this global crime syndicates have used our open society to come in and to infiltrate
[33:59.640 --> 34:04.480]  and to basically fully take over except they haven't taken over the free press completely
[34:04.480 --> 34:08.560]  they haven't taken over you individually yet and they haven't totally bankrupted you yet
[34:08.560 --> 34:14.280]  but they are devaluing the dollar now at an accelerated rate everywhere I go things cost
[34:14.280 --> 34:22.720]  more everywhere I go I see security everywhere and people being bossed around and felt up
[34:22.720 --> 34:28.720]  and military on the streets even in Austin and TSA that we are being prepared and it's
[34:28.720 --> 34:34.600]  in all the army manuals so we need to understand that if we don't expose this they're going
[34:34.600 --> 34:42.280]  to go ahead with the plan to roll all this out and the branding behind the scenes has
[34:42.280 --> 34:46.640]  gone from Al Qaeda is who they're going to be fighting they're going to be fighting people
[34:46.640 --> 34:51.160]  wearing John Deere caps literally that's who if you go to the urban warfare drills we've
[34:51.160 --> 34:55.400]  shown you the footage that's who they're trying to fight and that's what their own FBI Myak
[34:55.400 --> 34:59.160]  Homeland Security manuals that are in the news and I'd cover that four years ago and
[34:59.160 --> 35:04.560]  it was crazy now everybody listening knows that's been all over mainstream media with
[35:04.560 --> 35:15.720]  big sis defending it and I'm not trying to scare you I am climbing the walls on air
[35:15.720 --> 35:26.280]  and off of air I am climbing the walls trying to figure out how to stop this trying to figure
[35:26.280 --> 35:35.400]  out how to get the general public out of their trance I am doing the very very very very
[35:35.400 --> 35:42.000]  very best I can and you know I talked to so many people prominent people off record you
[35:42.000 --> 35:46.120]  name it and they go yeah no it's about what you say I have to apologize it just sounded
[35:46.120 --> 35:51.120]  so crazy but I guess we didn't look at history and yes it's probably worse than you're saying
[35:51.120 --> 35:54.280]  well what are you going to do about it all there's nothing you can do the public's too
[35:54.280 --> 36:03.200]  dumb too narcissistic and so we're just going to sit here I mean it's never a majority that
[36:03.200 --> 36:12.040]  stops things it's never a majority that takes over and does bad things but you know my main
[36:12.040 --> 36:20.280]  frustration is also that I care about people I have extreme empathy not sympathy once something's
[36:20.280 --> 36:26.320]  already happened I don't just have a fake sympathy I don't say fake little sympathetic
[36:26.320 --> 36:35.280]  things to act like I care I get hit in my stomach I literally like channel what I see
[36:35.280 --> 36:43.080]  other people going through it and it is torture that I mean having a lot of empathy means
[36:43.080 --> 36:50.000]  I have a lot of perception I'm very alive so are you out there I run into our listeners
[36:50.000 --> 36:54.480]  on the street and just the lightning in their eyes the spirit they have and so I know you
[36:54.480 --> 37:01.880]  know the frustration but there's also I'd rather be enjoying fine art fine music I would rather
[37:01.880 --> 37:07.320]  be spending time outside I would rather be spending time on my family I resent the new
[37:07.320 --> 37:13.480]  world order I resent the fact that they're so wicked and so stunted and twisted and I'm
[37:13.480 --> 37:20.920]  just so sick of not just the establishment being evil and corrupt but the general public
[37:20.920 --> 37:24.720]  being that way and that's what the establishment always says the time's off record I've been
[37:24.720 --> 37:30.960]  offered jobs and you know by about the establishment over the years they're always like Alex the
[37:30.960 --> 37:35.600]  public's even worse than we are they would tear you apart if they could you know they
[37:35.600 --> 37:39.800]  they hate you because you're talented they and of course that's an appeal to arrogance
[37:39.800 --> 37:47.360]  and appeal to ego but it's true but I will not join evil so I can sit back and and with
[37:47.360 --> 37:53.240]  them and laugh at everybody and then do everything I can to keep people in the dark forever see
[37:53.240 --> 38:00.680]  that's the thing they've done this to the public they've made people immoral and corrupt
[38:00.680 --> 38:07.920]  and wicked they've they've they've certainly thrown fuel on the fire and my spirit cannot
[38:07.920 --> 38:18.400]  join with evil but it doesn't matter at some levels because it just becomes evil anyways
[38:18.400 --> 38:23.000]  or they paint you as evil so that even though you do good work and want to help people they
[38:23.000 --> 38:27.700]  will paint you as evil so the weak minded see you as evil and so it what's whatever
[38:27.700 --> 38:44.760]  you do gets turned to evil but it's not going to go on much longer and the rotting is accelerating
[38:44.760 --> 38:48.440]  and I just think about the foster children drugged on six seven eight nine ten drugs
[38:48.440 --> 38:55.200]  with their teeth falling out dying of convulsions I think about just the mutation of humanity
[38:55.200 --> 39:00.140]  it's it's it's like an alien species came down on the earth took over the government
[39:00.140 --> 39:05.780]  and is running a computer program of how to incrementally dumb us down soft kill us medium
[39:05.780 --> 39:10.380]  kill us and then hard kill us just you know they kill you right away people would resist
[39:10.380 --> 39:15.100]  but if they slowly kill you no one knows where it's coming from unless you scientifically
[39:15.100 --> 39:19.020]  study it and then it's all there and you're like my god look they say they're doing it
[39:19.020 --> 39:24.900]  in the public slide because they're already in the throes of it and then you can't get
[39:24.900 --> 39:32.780]  mad at them because they've already been taken over by it and then you run into other smart
[39:32.780 --> 39:45.420]  people and they have decided to use the techniques of control on other people around them so
[39:45.420 --> 39:50.820]  they can quote get ahead and then that just adds to the whole culture of other people
[39:50.820 --> 39:58.340]  normal I'll just cheat to get ahead and then everyone gets more and more selfish and society
[39:58.340 --> 40:04.420]  collapses I mean we went out on the street and four out of ten people said that they
[40:04.420 --> 40:07.180]  should be able to kill their children up to age three the state should be able to kill
[40:07.180 --> 40:15.260]  children that are healthy and it's a woman's right to choose to kill her child it's a woman's
[40:15.260 --> 40:19.740]  right to have both their breasts removed before they even have any signs of cancer well if
[40:19.740 --> 40:24.500]  it's a right better go out and do it it's a woman's right to get a Gardasil shot that
[40:24.500 --> 40:29.940]  doesn't protect you from the papilloma virus and the cancer the insert says it but so what
[40:29.940 --> 40:36.880]  it's hyped up it's what women are doing and they go boys little dirty boys you could give
[40:36.880 --> 40:43.860]  girls the virus you need to take the shot and then it turns out the shot just so happens
[40:43.860 --> 40:48.580]  to lower fertility and give you autoimmune diseases a large percentage of the time and
[40:48.580 --> 40:54.980]  kill people as well and it's like big deal it kills people big deal flesh eating and
[40:54.980 --> 41:02.220]  other bacterias are killing hundreds of thousands a year big deal you know deer all the time
[41:02.220 --> 41:05.340]  or jumping through car windows killing two three four hundred a year depending on the
[41:05.340 --> 41:12.540]  year terrorism kills less than a hundred but it doesn't matter it's so sexy to roll around
[41:12.540 --> 41:24.620]  in fear and be scared of terrorist under every bush and it more and more it is just mind
[41:24.620 --> 41:32.060]  controlled arrested development bumbling people and it doesn't make me feel good that they're
[41:32.060 --> 41:43.180]  so stupid that they're so pathetic that they're so weak that they're so cowardly it freaks
[41:43.180 --> 41:52.860]  me out and it makes me want to remove myself from society because you know I walk out of
[41:52.860 --> 41:56.540]  a restaurant my kids in a motorcycle gang sitting there revving their things looking at me like
[41:56.540 --> 42:00.540]  they think they're tough I mean you might actually be able to deal deal with me maybe
[42:00.540 --> 42:05.940]  but not before I go like a caveman and literally bash two or three of your brains out and I'm
[42:05.940 --> 42:15.860]  scared of that man I can't put up with all the fake people anymore all the phony tough
[42:15.860 --> 42:22.300]  I just am so sick of the gangs the cop gangs the motorcycle gangs the bureaucrat gangs
[42:22.300 --> 42:28.620]  the lisping fake liberal gangs the good old boy gangs the country club gangs the trendy
[42:28.620 --> 42:37.220]  gangs the get they're not real people they're these robots in in in in in in in schools of
[42:37.220 --> 42:49.620]  swimming amoebas and then I go study the actual controllers of the entire program and they're
[42:49.620 --> 42:55.460]  not even that smart I mean they would know you're not going to get away with this it
[42:55.460 --> 42:58.820]  will blow back on you and then they even say that in a lot of their writings there they
[42:58.820 --> 43:02.860]  go but it doesn't matter we want to do it because all there is is the darkness all there
[43:02.860 --> 43:06.780]  is is doing something bad because you can do it all there is is screwing people over
[43:06.780 --> 43:10.380]  because you can get away with it and that's what the smart guys do that's what the winners
[43:10.380 --> 43:24.660]  do that's what the cool people do I mean I sit here and I read these army manuals where
[43:24.660 --> 43:29.540]  they're training for high treason to lock us up and torture us and reeducate us and
[43:29.540 --> 43:34.860]  and no media will even pick it up because that's just too hardcore no media will pick
[43:34.860 --> 43:39.300]  up the paper targets where they're training to shoot little kids and it was confirmed
[43:39.300 --> 43:54.260]  but no one will cover it but us do you think I like being the most hardcore most awake
[43:54.260 --> 44:06.580]  most focused it's a it is dangerous I don't know I just I just this world is so fake it's
[44:06.580 --> 44:18.820]  so plastic it is such a manifest fraud that I just can't partake of it none of it I just
[44:18.820 --> 44:24.740]  it almost all of it is diseased and rotten and there's some good things there but my
[44:24.740 --> 44:31.140]  god if we don't if we don't say no to all of this now I mean if people don't really
[44:31.140 --> 44:35.780]  start freaking out over what's going on and recognizing and getting out of your learned
[44:35.780 --> 44:41.500]  helplessness and out of your trance it's over folks what's going to happen is going
[44:41.500 --> 44:49.140]  to make and it's already ongoing what happened in the government orgies of death in the last
[44:49.140 --> 44:55.180]  century pale and significant the united nations is in mainstream news back of the paper like
[44:55.180 --> 45:01.940]  it's a good thing going into villages in central South America Africa and Asia and killing
[45:01.940 --> 45:15.900]  whole villages I mean they go in and they like something out of more locks in Eloise
[45:15.900 --> 45:19.540]  planet of the eight for everyone to call it I mean they go in and they chase them down
[45:19.540 --> 45:25.260]  and they kill them and then I sit there on the phone with like you know Bloomberg writers
[45:25.260 --> 45:27.940]  and I'm going you know our government did this and that it's on record we're not going
[45:27.940 --> 45:31.500]  to discuss that in giggle well you know that you the UN's doing this can I send you the
[45:31.500 --> 45:37.460]  article yeah right and it's just they're like children they have no idea and the people
[45:37.460 --> 45:42.820]  that write the articles normalizing killing people think they're like on some winning
[45:42.820 --> 45:46.980]  team doing this none of you are going to get out of this your kids aren't going to get
[45:46.980 --> 46:03.660]  out of this none of you are going to get out of this you idiots oh my god help me so the
[46:03.660 --> 46:09.580]  army's preparing for massive civil disturbances and societal collapse and to operate outside
[46:09.580 --> 46:16.980]  the president or Congress do you I mean I mean that's such a big deal in fact I'm even surprised
[46:16.980 --> 46:20.140]  by that you would think the criminals that run the government would would you know they
[46:20.140 --> 46:23.820]  got their own puppets but I mean I guess that's the ultimate puppeteering now they just got
[46:23.820 --> 46:27.580]  to buy off the generals like the Nazis did with the beachy French and have them stand
[46:27.580 --> 46:32.940]  down or they can do a big false flag newt congress when it's in session whatever and
[46:32.940 --> 46:37.700]  then just say the military is in charge and you know I've been hearing want to talk about
[46:37.700 --> 46:41.620]  you know go after Obama do this and that he needs to be impeached but nothing physical
[46:41.620 --> 46:45.940]  needs to happen to him they could they could go get rid of Obama and then and then oh we'll
[46:45.940 --> 46:49.620]  get behind the military restoring order that's what everybody keeps saying it'll just be something
[46:49.620 --> 46:55.980]  even worse and you could see all the preparations man because they know it's all about to collapse
[46:55.980 --> 46:59.620]  they engineered it this way but I don't think they can reverse it now we've gotten that deep
[46:59.620 --> 47:04.140]  into it it's like a perpetual motion machine or doomsday machine you know once it's counting
[47:04.140 --> 47:09.700]  down it's it's very hard to shut down and it's counting down now it's two minutes to
[47:09.700 --> 47:16.660]  midnight it's and they're lining up you know they're uncloking and I'm like red alert red
[47:16.660 --> 47:21.620]  alert here here it is red alert red alert we've been named as the enemy red alert people
[47:21.620 --> 47:27.140]  are like why don't you shut up you extremist so what do they take my bank account I'm going
[47:27.140 --> 47:44.980]  to salute them and so they're gonna be nice to me but what's gonna save us is everybody
[47:44.980 --> 47:48.820]  who laughs on the surface when you really talk to them for a minute they'll lower the laugh
[47:48.820 --> 47:53.820]  and look you'll see they're scared haha but they're scared they know so at least at least
[47:53.820 --> 47:59.460]  people out there know that there's something dangerous going on your sixth sense that God
[47:59.460 --> 48:07.260]  gave you you know but here's the thing you don't know how bad it really is and only the
[48:07.260 --> 48:12.220]  realization of how much trouble we're in is going to get us out of this and I'm telling
[48:12.220 --> 48:17.820]  you if you study criminology especially in domesticated populations you can go to a
[48:17.820 --> 48:23.460]  horrible third world warren of crime and look at the statistics if somebody tries to corner
[48:23.460 --> 48:29.020]  a woman or somebody tries to suck a kid into a van the kid runs immediately and doesn't
[48:29.020 --> 48:36.500]  go the woman fights back you go to civilized western nations of domesticated schlubs seven
[48:36.500 --> 48:42.380]  eight times out of 10 in the last 30 40 years of the criminology a woman can know she's being
[48:42.380 --> 48:46.340]  kidnapped to be put in a van and she still is so scared to admit it's happening she'll
[48:46.340 --> 48:53.780]  go and do it and men will do it and that's why you can walk up to people and say we
[48:53.780 --> 48:59.300]  want Nazi Germany in America to keep us safe and so Obama can take our guns and nine out
[48:59.300 --> 49:04.140]  of ten people in in LA will sign it because they're scared and they just want to do what
[49:04.140 --> 49:11.180]  the government says yeah we've actually gone out with mark dice and you know said let's
[49:11.180 --> 49:18.580]  you basically bring in fascist Nazi rule for Obama and they say yes and they know what
[49:18.580 --> 49:23.900]  Nazis are but they still they hear Obama oh I'm part of the team it's a woman's right
[49:23.900 --> 49:29.740]  to kill her child up to age three and the women are like yes I like that that's power
[49:29.740 --> 49:35.580]  she's a powerless who's never had a chance to have any small power that they built themselves
[49:35.580 --> 49:40.540]  then don't appreciate it and know how dangerous it is so then they just imagine like a moth
[49:40.540 --> 49:45.900]  to flame that it's some great fulfillment they're going to have and then they see through
[49:45.900 --> 49:52.300]  the black uniforms and the and the nighttime Nazi rallies they see this majesty this reflected
[49:52.300 --> 50:03.820]  glory that that they are going to be empowered even in their own destruction because they
[50:03.820 --> 50:07.780]  were never made to hunt as children they were never made to fight as children they were
[50:07.780 --> 50:13.300]  never put through tribal rituals good wholesome ancient rituals they were put through modern
[50:13.300 --> 50:20.980]  rituals when I say modern rituals six thousand year old and up dehumanizing rituals of fraud
[50:20.980 --> 50:29.620]  where the the headdress is why you have status not because you instinctively know where to
[50:29.620 --> 50:42.140]  take people to find the game it's a world of fraud it's planet hoax and I'm just looking

[55:58.740 --> 56:04.980]  at the same time we've got to admit how bad it is because then we know we've got to turn this around
[56:04.980 --> 56:10.980]  got to stop putting a perfume on this thing this pig so we got all that coming up
[56:13.460 --> 56:17.460]  and we got a bunch of other clips uh here today i think we're going to premiere tonight on the
[56:17.460 --> 56:22.340]  nightly news seven o'clock central he says it's done but i'm going to see it today and see if i
[56:22.340 --> 56:28.260]  want to add anything we did this i don't know six months ago and it's it's one of the literally over
[56:28.260 --> 56:32.340]  a hundred things we've never gotten done because we just do so much and then never complete it
[56:32.340 --> 56:36.420]  because we love liberty have a great team because once you work here and see all this you don't
[56:36.420 --> 56:41.620]  want to stop fighting it you know it'll upset you and by the grace of god we've assembled a really
[56:41.620 --> 56:46.500]  good group of people we all of us need your prayers is to be in and around this is very stressful
[56:48.020 --> 56:54.340]  and i need your prayers as well but um we did something really fun to try to illustrate the
[56:54.340 --> 56:59.940]  second amendment dealing with with laser beams and particle beams i went out and bought some of
[56:59.940 --> 57:05.060]  the most powerful consumer grade you can get even more powerful industrial ones but it takes a license
[57:05.060 --> 57:11.140]  and stuff we could have done that uh but we went out and bought like 400 500 laser blue white laser
[57:11.140 --> 57:21.700]  and a green laser and uh we recreated a laser battle with star wars figures this will definitely go
[57:21.700 --> 57:27.460]  viral and then it's it's filled with news about directed energy weapons it's got 50 cows shooting
[57:27.460 --> 57:33.300]  armor i mean it's got it's pretty wild video and it's got me in there talking about it uh so that's
[57:33.300 --> 57:38.260]  going to premiere tonight on the nightly news and if you're not a prison planet dot tv member i mean
[57:39.140 --> 57:43.780]  we need our own platform with all the censorship happening on youtube we post all the stuff we do
[57:43.780 --> 57:49.780]  on youtube a day or so later but they try to censor it we have to fight and file in court to keep
[57:49.780 --> 57:54.900]  this thing up i mean it's a big hassle but we do it but if you just want to go see it all in high

[01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.660]  so clever and classless and free but you're still bleeping peasants as far as i can see
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:52.260]  a working class hero is something to be and i think we've been dope with religion and sex and tv
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:16:00.580]  and when i say religion i don't mean faith i mean religion and uh we are this this is so
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:08.100]  beautifully orchestrated somebody either there really is one great dark power that runs this earth
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:13.300]  as it stated in the holy scriptures oh it's not human no it may you exactly the more i study it
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:19.300]  it is it is a entity it it is call it whatever you want a dark force is running this and that's
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:24.500]  what i've come there to is i'm facing this thing and i i just wish people knew how much peril they're
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:30.900]  in john well the thing that it is alex is what we have to remember is um the ones who get it
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:36.980]  get it and the ones who don't get it are never going to get it and that's just the that's i'm
[01:16:36.980 --> 01:16:43.300]  afraid that's just the the cold hard harsh reality we would like to think that we'll wake them up
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:48.100]  we'll enlighten them we'll rise up as one people and we'll coil this evil but a lot of people are
[01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:52.980]  just going to go right along with it this is something that i find very interesting not to
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:56.180]  stray too far away because you ask the question what do i make of all this i think there's about
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:17:01.460]  to be a war against the civilian population i'll tell you why everywhere you go if you if you look
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:08.180]  at at every false flag operation through history from the battleship man to the lucetania to pearl
[01:17:08.180 --> 01:17:13.860]  harbor to the gulf of tonkin to nine eleven on and on and on these false flags were all in further
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:20.660]  instance of developing a war-like atmosphere and what happens when you have a war going on
[01:17:20.660 --> 01:17:27.940]  well the citizens die the leaders largely are preserved and its business as usual i mean germany
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:33.700]  was a highly sophisticated still is in those days was a highly sophisticated society music
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:38.340]  literature art everything and virtually the entire place was destroyed look at them now
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:47.060]  they're the ones propping up the entire european union so people die and business goes on which
[01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:50.980]  goes back to the scripture and i don't want to turn this into a sermon but it's like the love of
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:57.060]  money is the root of all evil and this is all about money and when you look at the money that has
[01:17:57.060 --> 01:18:06.660]  been made from these ongoing undeclared wars such as vietnam korea even less to to a lesser extent
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:13.460]  but still korea as well and now this ongoing war aren't on terror you can see that wherever there is
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:19.140]  chaos you know that expression follow the chaos that's where the opportunity is i'm thinking
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:23.940]  that the middle east may be close to being tapped out china and russia got the the oil deals we
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:28.340]  didn't it was all about oil in iraq but not i don't think we got into the oil we're still
[01:18:28.340 --> 01:18:33.780]  exporting oil and i'm thinking the next big uh the next big playground the next big boom town
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:40.340]  sorry about the pun is going to be the u.s i think the tearing down this society and then
[01:18:40.340 --> 01:18:48.980]  rebuilding it is going to mean big bucks for somebody i totally i totally agree with you and
[01:18:50.020 --> 01:18:56.260]  it is it is it is very saddening to you know to see it unfolding but i think at the same time it's
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:19:05.780]  part of a test of society and culture and this is what makes humanity uh great is the adversity and
[01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:12.260]  it's been the liberty we we had was so great we became fat dumb and happy generationally and so
[01:19:12.260 --> 01:19:16.980]  the checks and balances were so great that it held it back for a long time but the evil grew
[01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:23.380]  in the secret places and got very big and now it's out in the open and people who've been in
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:29.380]  denial are so invested in saying that it isn't real that now they're going to deny things even
[01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:34.740]  as the country burns well look what's going on up there in these hearings look at this so-called

[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:26.020]  the scandal that's deepening right now of course they're using the IRS to harass
[01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:31.060]  libertarians and patriots of course they are you know the lady that ran it all is now over
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:35.460]  obama care now they're going to share your medical records everywhere you know they're saying our
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:41.140]  military is run is run by nato and is now even above the president well why not that's what it
[01:24:41.140 --> 01:24:46.740]  was when they said last year nato was over it and if they just say it in a lawyerly way we're now
[01:24:46.740 --> 01:24:53.700]  in basically a military coup d'etat uh to quote carlos from hop which is french for coup d'etat
[01:24:53.700 --> 01:24:56.980]  you know some gallows humor there so john b wells you were getting to that point go ahead
[01:24:57.540 --> 01:25:01.780]  well i just think that we're in a cold civil war right now i really do and i know that's
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.980]  dangerous talk i don't think i'm doing myself and maybe not even you as vocal as you are about
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:11.300]  these issues any favors by saying something like that but i would submit to you that we are in a
[01:25:11.300 --> 01:25:16.740]  cold civil war it just hasn't happened yet you have a you have a president up there that does
[01:25:16.740 --> 01:25:21.860]  nothing but deny you have an attorney general that goes all the way back to the oklahoma bombing
[01:25:21.860 --> 01:25:25.220]  as a said what the assistant district assistant attorney general under clinton
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:30.660]  he didn't know anything he didn't know anything about fast and furious didn't know anything about
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:34.820]  Benghazi didn't know anything about the irs scandal didn't know anything about anything he's just
[01:25:34.820 --> 01:25:42.260]  denied denied denied deny alex i bought a book and i got a little story for you in a minute
[01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:47.780]  it's a quick one i bought a little book cost me 50 bucks i found one copy on amazon and so i bought
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:53.300]  it it's called my new order by adolf hitler and it's mostly his speeches if you get this book and
[01:25:53.300 --> 01:25:58.820]  you read it you will see that you are experiencing virtually the same thing that's printed on these
[01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:04.820]  pages but here's something else a friend of mine in germany you know i would tease him all the time
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:09.860]  about this and that nazi this nazi that and among other among the things that he told me
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:15.300]  just pieces over the years were that he and his wife if they speak in their dialect
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:19.780]  their little colloquialisms and slang the people who speak what they call bookish german
[01:26:20.740 --> 01:26:25.620]  have no idea what he's talking about so i stored that piece of data then he said that even his dad
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:29.780]  said why do you have to speak so bookish i stored that piece of data because dad thought he was just
[01:26:29.780 --> 01:26:34.660]  being a little bit too uptight then this gal came over from munich and she was a yoga girl
[01:26:35.780 --> 01:26:42.980]  and um and uh my friend said uh stephanie speaks very bookish german then eventually we started
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:48.580]  talking about we just brought up mind confid he said john that book made no sense to me whatsoever
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:55.700]  i could not understand anything that he was trying to write the years went by and it came up again
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:27:02.660]  and he said john i read mind confid in english and it made so much sense to me and i thought
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:09.540]  you mean you understood what was being written he said yes i thought to myself i wonder if that
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:16.180]  means that it was originally written in english and translated into german in which case how deep
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:23.620]  do these routes go wow it's funny you bring that up we were talking yesterday about mainline history
[01:27:23.620 --> 01:27:28.580]  but it's not popularly known that our government and the british government actually funded hitler
[01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:33.620]  and his rise and then he had a peace treaty with the british and a deal with the king of england
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:38.020]  ebbard the eighth to launch world war two and then england was going to join him and then they
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:45.300]  double-crossed him and that's like mainline history but no but it's not on a history channel
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:51.140]  that's right and wallace simpson had nothing to do with edwards abdication so that george could
[01:27:51.140 --> 01:27:56.660]  take over nothing at all it's because it was generally known in those circles that edward
[01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:04.180]  and adaf were buddy buddy and they were well yeah he was german and but i mean again there you're
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:09.380]  informed it wasn't about the divorce but the general public's like the british were nazis take
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:15.620]  take um prince philip his cousin the head of the netherlands he was an ss officer
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:23.780]  pretty small club isn't it alex yeah founder of the builder bar group well these people have
[01:28:23.780 --> 01:28:31.780]  the capacity to make very very long range plans most uh most citizens make a plan that's the length
[01:28:31.780 --> 01:28:39.620]  of their latest car loan but these people plan 50 years 100 years they understand that to shape a
[01:28:39.620 --> 01:28:44.500]  global society it's going to take a minute to do that because they'll meet though we met with
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:49.460]  resistance if they try and push the agenda too quickly so they just push it slowly it appears
[01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:56.340]  that we're we may perhaps have been and may in future even more so take orders from the united
[01:28:56.340 --> 01:29:01.460]  nations and i think we know that everywhere the united nation shows up with their blue helmets
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:07.940]  and their rifles chaos and hell comes with them so since when did we start taking orders from
[01:29:07.940 --> 01:29:18.500]  the united nation since when does some uh universal arms treaty apply to us well i don't know the only
[01:29:18.500 --> 01:29:23.620]  way that we can turn this around is to is to make is it to make our lists and do everything that we
[01:29:23.620 --> 01:29:31.140]  possibly can to remove people in office who shouldn't be there we can we can do this but someone has to
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.700]  do the legwork someone has to do the research exactly and the general public has to have a
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:40.340]  psychological and spiritual break with these globalists because remember there was no world
[01:29:40.340 --> 01:29:44.740]  government and we were cooks now it's here but we're cooks because we don't want it i mean
[01:29:44.740 --> 01:29:52.340]  it's incredible stay there john b wells our guest calls coming up we're on the march the empires on

[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:30.660]  we are going back to our guest who I hope can sit with us a little bit the
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:34.820]  next hour and ride shotgun and take phone calls today amazing talk show
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:39.260]  host whenever I'm out driving around on Saturday night or then on Sunday night
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:42.700]  because they were here at locally the next night I loved listening to John B.
[01:34:42.700 --> 01:34:47.180]  Wells and he has a lot of courage to because I've been on guest on his show
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:52.460]  he has a lot of other patriots on his broadcast and it's just you know on over
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:57.100]  500 affiliates so he reaches probably every night five million people six
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:00.860]  million people when he does the Saturday show so it's just wonderful to have him
[01:35:00.860 --> 01:35:06.780]  there doing that but before I go any further by the way we put 80,000 of the
[01:35:06.780 --> 01:35:12.020]  magazine each month that we sell in bulk at cost at m4store.com we put 80,000 as
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:16.980]  a test on the streets of San Antonio in Austin and this sold out the issue sold
[01:35:16.980 --> 01:35:21.220]  out in about five days the I don't know what was it 30 something thousand we
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:25.740]  kept back you know to sell it bulk you know to get the word out because people
[01:35:25.740 --> 01:35:29.260]  really pay attention to a big glossy color magazine full of graphics and three
[01:35:29.260 --> 01:35:34.500]  free bumper stickers in it and so much more but it's sold out I mean the last
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:38.300]  time we had something sell out that quick was magazines like into its tent
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.220]  issue now I guess we had one sell out in about two weeks this sold out in less
[01:35:42.220 --> 01:35:47.940]  than a week so we ran out and found a thousand or so you know that had just
[01:35:47.940 --> 01:35:52.940]  been put on the street and pulled those back off and then there was such a
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:58.420]  demand I said just scour everywhere so we sent out the crew and they were able
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:02.340]  to get a little more than a thousand again but that is yet and it will be sold
[01:36:02.340 --> 01:36:07.180]  out very very quickly m4store.com you can buy them
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:13.260]  individually or in bulk and it also supports the you know broadcast because
[01:36:13.260 --> 01:36:17.580]  we're selling these limited amount at an actual profit imagine that evil ideas
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:22.300]  we can try to print more magazines and it's just something I believe in and

[01:39:22.900 --> 01:39:29.300]  here it all is IRS stalled conservatives groups getting 501 C3 or others but
[01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:33.180]  gave speedy approval to Obama foundations agency use planted questions to
[01:39:33.180 --> 01:39:37.500]  reveal scandal well of course I mean in the eastern Germany you know the party
[01:39:37.500 --> 01:39:40.660]  members decided which women could be stars demanded sex from all of them
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:45.980]  that's what having government run things is like absolutely not illegal is
[01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:50.500]  what the White House is now saying the scum house is this still America Charles
[01:39:50.500 --> 01:39:55.860]  wrangle outrage wrong to abuse the tax system in charge during key party
[01:39:55.860 --> 01:40:00.260]  targeting now runs IRS Obamacare office of course they're gonna use your
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:03.300]  medical records and leak them to the press they've already done that IRS
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:07.500]  Hinch woman got a hundred and three thousand dollars in bonuses for raking
[01:40:07.500 --> 01:40:11.220]  people over the calls that's the kind of stuff up on drugs report dot com you
[01:40:11.220 --> 01:40:19.140]  know spying on the media spying on the cloakroom it just goes on and on what's
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:23.380]  going on and then meanwhile military says no presidential authorization needed
[01:40:23.380 --> 01:40:27.980]  to quell civil disturbances that is the equivalent of a nuclear bomb going off
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:33.180]  in DC I mean it's bad enough to say NATO's in charge now the military's in
[01:40:33.180 --> 01:40:36.700]  charge themselves but they say they follow orders from NATO that's an
[01:40:36.700 --> 01:40:41.660]  narcotics trafficking Bilderberg group Nazi founded organization that's what
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:46.900]  I'm saying man we're overrun and I'm ranting you've got the floor well I
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:51.060]  wish I could rant like that so I appreciate being able to do it by proxy
[01:40:51.060 --> 01:40:54.580]  Alex it's it's absolutely unbelievable and the thing is is that
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:41:00.700]  there it's you know that thing about one bad apple can spoil the barrel yes
[01:41:00.700 --> 01:41:06.460]  that's really true the the the strident liberals I mean I get an email
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:10.780]  email everyone's while going you're just a right winger it's like given a choice
[01:41:10.780 --> 01:41:15.460]  between the right wing and the left I'm most assuredly a right winger heard
[01:41:15.460 --> 01:41:19.700]  McDermott today say in those hearings as much as I don't like the right the
[01:41:19.700 --> 01:41:24.820]  right wing and I thought to myself well McDermott you were a have traditionally
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:31.340]  been an idiot and I don't know how you remain in power but I began to wonder
[01:41:31.340 --> 01:41:38.660]  what is it about the right that you don't like exactly they foment lies that
[01:41:38.660 --> 01:41:42.580]  is their stock in trade all the tea party I that's just a whole that's a
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:49.660]  bunch of racists I have seen no racism whatsoever nothing at any of
[01:41:49.660 --> 01:41:54.260]  those gatherings of the of the tea partiers all they want to play it and
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:59.060]  all they have to do is it just going back to dear old uncle egged off all you
[01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:05.060]  have to do is continue to beat that drum and some of these people enough of them
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:09.100]  to make a difference are going to go along with it but but yes we have been
[01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:15.780]  hijacked by a criminal regime end of story it's been visibly corrupt since
[01:42:15.780 --> 01:42:20.620]  the Kennedy assassination but we're distracted we're distracted with one
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:24.140]  war after another what happened in North Korea I put out over a coast to coast
[01:42:24.140 --> 01:42:28.020]  a m I said you know my source and it's a good one and I can't not I cannot name
[01:42:28.020 --> 01:42:31.900]  him you only have my word for it but I've given it to you there are things
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:35.620]  going on behind the scenes you won't be hearing anything from I'm paraphrasing
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:41.020]  or you won't be hearing much out of Kim Jong-un in the very near future and
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:45.420]  what happened he just drops right off the scope he's gone not another word about
[01:42:45.420 --> 01:42:49.860]  it one minute he's threatened Austin LA and every place else threatened in
[01:42:49.860 --> 01:42:53.660]  Japan all that the next minute he's gone well why is that's because they pull the
[01:42:53.660 --> 01:42:58.540]  China pull the chain on his money that's what this is all about this is all
[01:42:58.540 --> 01:43:05.500]  about money and these people are going to soak the citizens of this nation for
[01:43:05.500 --> 01:43:12.900]  everything they can everything they will disarm us if it comes down to it they
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:17.580]  will pit the races against each other and the Liberals will continue to push
[01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:23.980]  this ridiculous immigration reform you know my immigration reform is go home
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:30.380]  now all illegal aliens must leave now just like any other country you can't
[01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:35.620]  just come here and just decide we like it here all all 11 they say 11 million
[01:43:35.620 --> 01:43:39.900]  I'm thinking more like 30 million oh we're gonna run across the board have a
[01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.780]  baby now we're with babies a citizen is an anchor baby we're that's just wrong
[01:43:43.780 --> 01:43:46.900]  why are they doing that Mexico doesn't let you do that and again the
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:51.900]  government's then there to try to make them clients of the government or the
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:56.580]  political takeover and then they use it to create a national ID card for the
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:01.500]  citizens again I mean all these bills are piggybacked with a bunch of other
[01:44:01.500 --> 01:44:06.260]  garbage and notice they're trying to get everything passed right now and the
[01:44:06.260 --> 01:44:12.220]  military talks about massive widespread disturbances that are so bad for the
[01:44:12.220 --> 01:44:17.020]  first time in history the president or the Congress may not be there to
[01:44:17.020 --> 01:44:21.540]  respond to it during the Cold War they didn't have this on the books what do
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:27.180]  you think they're getting ready for well I still think this economic collapse
[01:44:27.180 --> 01:44:30.500]  going back to the money thing I think the money is the trade the money is the
[01:44:30.500 --> 01:44:34.460]  trigger for everything I was just looking at this thing called the traders wire
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:40.140]  and it's the article is ten scenes from the ongoing global economic
[01:44:40.140 --> 01:44:45.460]  collapse 27% unemployment 60% youth unemployment in Greece Detroit and
[01:44:45.460 --> 01:44:49.700]  Michigan Detroit Michigan's insolvent rapidly running out of cash economic
[01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:54.860]  despair in France 7,000 abandoned buildings in Dayton Ohio overwhelmed by
[01:44:54.860 --> 01:45:00.340]  squatters in Spain the collapse of Chinese power consumption horrible
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:03.180]  economic data coming out of the second-largest economy on the planet
[01:45:03.180 --> 01:45:07.140]  that would wet that would be China one out of every five U.S. households on
[01:45:07.140 --> 01:45:12.020]  food stamps child hunger in America the tremendous suffering of hundreds of
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.820]  millions of people desperately poor people that we never even are going
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:19.860]  bankrupt all over the country not just Detroit and and and then you'll have
[01:45:19.860 --> 01:45:26.580]  city managers paid $800,000 yes you know Alex I think what we should do is is
[01:45:26.580 --> 01:45:31.580]  is it invoke that old radio bumper from back in the Stone Age which is tell
[01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:40.500]  your friends about info wars tell your friends to wake up pull your friends
[01:45:40.500 --> 01:45:47.140]  into it one person can pull like you you alluded to earlier 1015 people 10 or
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:52.140]  15 of their friends into it people thought that I was completely just you
[01:45:52.140 --> 01:45:57.020]  know looking for trouble looking for some sort of a conspiracy somewhere but
[01:45:57.020 --> 01:46:00.180]  over the last three years is a new little circle of friends that I that I
[01:46:00.180 --> 01:46:05.860]  developed they're saying you know what you said actually came to pass I said oh
[01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:09.540]  yes and there's much more educate yourself don't listen don't repeat things
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:14.700]  like a parrot go to the net and go look for yourself but you know Alex the thing
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:20.300]  that I find extraordinary is there is still some underlying credibility that
[01:46:20.300 --> 01:46:24.540]  mainstream media has and I popped off last Saturday night and said that of the
[01:46:24.540 --> 01:46:28.900]  of the four major news outlets excluding some I'm talking about the network
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:35.540]  people I liked Fox the best because at least they'll talk about it the other
[01:46:35.540 --> 01:46:39.980]  ones won't even talk about it and then when you look at Gates Bill Gates and
[01:46:39.980 --> 01:46:46.700]  his MSNBC I'm sure that most people do not know that that means Microsoft NBC and
[01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:51.700]  it does well people don't they don't believe it you say that to them and they
[01:46:51.700 --> 01:46:56.860]  don't believe it and they say things like and you know this that Alex Jones
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.580]  must must work for the CIA because you know he's still walking around out there
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:06.220]  it's Alex Jones is visibility that keeps him safe and I intend to keep you as
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:09.860]  visible as possible and you can trust me on this brother unless they get me at
[01:47:09.860 --> 01:47:12.980]  the same time if anything happens to you you're gonna have a crew of some real
[01:47:12.980 --> 01:47:16.380]  serious cats trying to find out what happened to you so I appreciate it
[01:47:16.380 --> 01:47:20.020]  brother that feels good that's why that's why I try to you know hook up with
[01:47:20.020 --> 01:47:23.140]  other people like you I try to promote other people over the years and try to
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:26.740]  fight the globalist because I know how real it is you know how real it is and
[01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:31.540]  yeah that's what Jim Garrison said of course of JFK fame he said look you
[01:47:31.540 --> 01:47:34.740]  you they said why are you still alive and everybody else is dead because I'm
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:40.420]  visible people think hiding and groveling gives them protection from
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:47.980]  mafia's and gangs it's the opposite they go after the low-lying cowardly fruit
[01:47:47.980 --> 01:47:52.100]  well that's true and you know I read a very very interesting article I think
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:56.620]  it came from the from the UK Daily Mail now this is not picking on people who
[01:47:56.620 --> 01:48:00.700]  don't eat their Wheaties so to speak but according to a study a study can
[01:48:00.700 --> 01:48:05.620]  stuck conducted by a British scientific Institute I'd get into it here but I'll
[01:48:05.620 --> 01:48:10.700]  be doing the same thing Rubio did with his his bottle of water it seems that
[01:48:10.700 --> 01:48:16.980]  their study revealed that physically strong men are more inclined to be on
[01:48:16.980 --> 01:48:23.380]  the right while not physically strong men are inclined to be for the welfare
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:28.220]  estate and for just a generally socialistic environment now their
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:32.900]  study did not reveal any difference whatsoever in women who were either
[01:48:32.900 --> 01:48:38.260]  physically fit physically strong women or the more petite ones who don't work
[01:48:38.260 --> 01:48:43.820]  out all the time except maybe just keep themselves toned as we consume these
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:50.540]  poisonous foods and as we are encouraged to participate in behavior that is not
[01:48:50.540 --> 01:48:57.820]  really very good for us I think we're developing more weakness generally and
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:49:01.900]  when you make people weak and you give them health problems now this is this
[01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:05.220]  is getting out of the fridge a little bit but once you've contributed enough to
[01:49:05.220 --> 01:49:10.540]  the poor health condition of the population they're gonna drift toward
[01:49:10.540 --> 01:49:14.500]  please take care of me I'm not strong enough to take care of myself I went to
[01:49:14.500 --> 01:49:19.020]  a rock and roll concert just to say I did last week and I was appalled at my
[01:49:19.020 --> 01:49:23.260]  generation's physical condition these people were so overweight and look so
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:27.260]  unhealthy I couldn't believe what I was seeing even you know even the younger
[01:49:27.260 --> 01:49:31.220]  ones looked a little rough but I mean you know I saw that study you were
[01:49:31.220 --> 01:49:35.180]  talking about and in the rats that they feed GMO even if they exercise them they
[01:49:35.180 --> 01:49:39.420]  get fat because the body's kind of putting it on as a defense mechanism and
[01:49:39.420 --> 01:49:45.980]  and you're absolutely right I mean in animal husbandry you feed aggressive
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:49.700]  species of domesticated animals certain diets that are known to make them more
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:54.980]  passive and and and that's it men and women that are statist are usually so
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:50:00.660]  cowardly they really believe the state loves them and is their daddy and see
[01:50:00.660 --> 01:50:04.860]  that's their daddy and their perpetual children well the men are children of
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:09.340]  the state the women are the ladies of the state the state is their husband
[01:50:09.340 --> 01:50:14.580]  and that's actually how the Romans 2,000 years ago in slave manuals that I've
[01:50:14.580 --> 01:50:19.420]  covered on air described it the women we marry to the state and then and then the
[01:50:19.420 --> 01:50:26.260]  man will be perpetual children under the house slave that is the woman if they
[01:50:26.260 --> 01:50:29.580]  can get the women to do it I'll tell you I made a I gave a little tribute to
[01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:33.900]  mothers on Mother's Day early Mother's Day morning and mothers approved positive
[01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:39.700]  that the women really are stronger and what I find is that the women who send
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:45.420]  emails to me at the coast address are they're at there and they email me in
[01:50:45.420 --> 01:50:48.740]  greater numbers than the men do there are a lot of there are a lot of support
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:51.700]  from the men out there oh no no I'm not exactly I'm not demonizing women I'm
[01:50:51.700 --> 01:50:56.700]  saying the women that are statist see this government as their husband and the
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:51:00.980]  men are perpetual children that's the globalist model but I agree with you
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:05.420]  there's been a disaster and most of you don't even realize the terrible danger
[01:51:05.420 --> 01:51:09.900]  we're in Alex Jones has warned you for years to get a good food storage we
[01:51:09.900 --> 01:51:14.460]  thought the danger was drought or food delivered to our gas tanks or our food

[01:51:18.460 --> 01:51:22.420]  stamps and welfare could afford it but we have just experienced the most

[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:32.280]  news to cover I want to go to Steve I want to go to Casey Yote Eric Phil
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:36.020]  everybody we're gonna get to you've been holding a while after they leave us

[01:54:44.500 --> 01:54:48.060]  understand something though because I come at this what John was just talking
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:51.780]  about from a position to be an angry at somebody trying to make me and my family
[01:54:51.780 --> 01:54:54.980]  a slave and when they're doing it to you I take it personal because if it can
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:59.360]  happen to you it happened to me it's called empathy folks you know I mean I
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:02.980]  see something happen to somebody else's kids by the government or a group I take
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:07.420]  it like it's my kid okay and and and I know why people get callous and
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:11.940]  manipulative because it's painful to sit there and really have empathy but you
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:16.740]  know what you're alive when you do and the so-called left or a bunch of
[01:55:16.740 --> 01:55:20.740]  authoritarians or an authoritarian cult the right is their placeholder it works
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:24.460]  with them but it's not really a real right wing of you use that term pro gun
[01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:29.180]  family that that's all talk to to move the paradigm over they're really
[01:55:29.180 --> 01:55:33.700]  authoritarians with a globalist technocratic agenda that's their own
[01:55:33.700 --> 01:55:42.620]  words and they are hell bent hell bent hell bent on radically transforming
[01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:48.060]  humanity into a system they control to reduce population so this doesn't end
[01:55:48.060 --> 01:55:52.900]  at a good place you're not breaking eggs to make a great utopian omelet it
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:57.060]  always creates a nightmare because that's what they want to create you know
[01:55:57.060 --> 01:56:00.220]  Jeffrey Dahmer created his own little heaven it's a nightmare for you or I
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:05.420]  heaven for him and you know I get up here and tell it like it is because the
[01:56:05.420 --> 01:56:09.900]  reality is hardcore John B. Wells we're gonna go to break here got a five minute
[01:56:09.900 --> 01:56:12.580]  segment coming up and a 12 minute segment and a six minute segment and an
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:15.340]  18 minute segment and a five minute segment but that's what's left in the
[01:56:15.340 --> 01:56:19.020]  broadcast today but I want to start one of the calls when we start the next hour
[01:56:19.020 --> 01:56:23.100]  and we'll go directly to them until we go through a couple boards of them but
[01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:28.940]  you've heard what I've laid out here what else is on your radar screen and I
[01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:32.220]  agree with you I've noticed it's women that are the most charged up and
[01:56:32.220 --> 01:56:35.820]  aggressive against the New World Order who get it so I wasn't scapegoating
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:39.220]  women as bad and I know you weren't saying that I want to be I want to
[01:56:39.220 --> 01:56:42.980]  clarify it Hitler said first you get the women then you've got the children so
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:47.220]  follow the men as you know 80% of advertising roughly in the West is
[01:56:47.220 --> 01:56:52.500]  targeted at women because women make most of the decisions and I mean that's
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:56.900]  just that's why it's been in every culture and so that's what so that's why
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:02.500]  women are targeted that's why I bring up the women your comments on that yes and
[01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:06.980]  I didn't mean to suggest however obliquely that you were doing that so
[01:57:06.980 --> 01:57:10.540]  let me just make that that perfectly clear no you were not doing that and
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:15.500]  neither was I what I'm saying is ladies here's the fact of the matter you have
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:20.220]  more power than you think I understand I heard a guy say something one time I'm
[01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:23.580]  gonna go ahead and blur this out Alex said he never heard such language coming
[01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:28.300]  out of people in his life in his restaurant and I said what do you think
[01:57:28.300 --> 01:57:34.060]  is doing this and he eventually said the attempted exploitation of women
[01:57:34.060 --> 01:57:38.380]  which is has been going on for a long time but he said he suggested that this
[01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:46.660]  was a gentleman's club mentality that these men are trying to impose on women
[01:57:46.660 --> 01:57:52.300]  in general and making these shall we say exotic exhibitionists something to look
[01:57:52.300 --> 01:57:59.380]  up to as if they have to conform to this this algorithm what I would suggest
[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:06.980]  is women take charge of your men I'm gonna go back to scripture for very
[01:58:06.980 --> 01:58:11.540]  briefly a lot of women take exception to the what you really think that we
[01:58:11.540 --> 01:58:18.380]  should submit to our husbands back at interpretation you submit an application
[01:58:18.380 --> 01:58:24.620]  if I if I say Alex I would submit to you that Eric Holder needs to be thrown out
[01:58:24.620 --> 01:58:29.820]  of his office submit means to bring to all that scripture means my
[01:58:29.820 --> 01:58:33.860]  interpretation of it is that you bring your problem to the old man tell him
[01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:40.580]  what you need including if he's messing up which he is absolutely stay there

[02:00:12.540 --> 02:00:20.060]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas
[02:00:20.060 --> 02:00:23.540]  alex jones
[02:00:27.700 --> 02:00:32.180]  ladies and gentlemen we are now into the third hour of this worldwide broadcast
[02:00:32.180 --> 02:00:37.300]  I'm gonna cover a ton of news with john b wells syndicated radio host I was
[02:00:37.300 --> 02:00:40.620]  coast to coast a m dot com and I appreciate everybody holding let's
[02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:44.740]  let's go through calls for about 30 minutes then back into news analysis
[02:00:44.740 --> 02:00:48.580]  with john b wells he's gonna be riding shotgun with us this is a short little
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:52.300]  segment because for years I didn't want to stations didn't want to carry the
[02:00:52.300 --> 02:00:55.340]  news so I do this five minutes but it's a weird clock we're gonna be changing
[02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:57.900]  into the regular clocks and for everybody just so they know that
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:04.940]  steven florida you're on the air welcome yeah good afternoon Alex and john
[02:01:04.940 --> 02:01:09.660]  Alex first of all I called to talk about the corruption of the court system
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:14.180]  but I just wanted to say first I can so much relate to you I've had people say
[02:01:14.180 --> 02:01:19.220]  you know oh you're so fanatical I don't understand you you're the intensity and
[02:01:19.220 --> 02:01:23.260]  you're you're driven and you know it just seems like you're you're just so
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:28.020]  jealous for all this stuff and and it's just basically because the majority of
[02:01:28.020 --> 02:01:33.100]  people I encounter they are so asleep when it comes to what you know going on
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:36.780]  and they're in the matrix instead of being outside of it and so they can't
[02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:41.260]  see the truth and you know I'm reminded that God says he'll send them strong
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:44.860]  delusion that they should believe a lie and the reason is not God wants people
[02:01:44.860 --> 02:01:50.340]  believing lies but they chose that like God hadn't failed hard after no yeah the
[02:01:50.340 --> 02:01:53.740]  Holy Spirit quits knocking on the door it's like okay you consciously want this
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:59.020]  yeah but I mean that's it look being alive is intense if you know if I'm at
[02:01:59.020 --> 02:02:03.380]  home eight o'clock at night hanging out my wife I'm relaxed watching a movie but
[02:02:03.380 --> 02:02:07.660]  when I'm really focusing on this news and stuff I I would be giving into it
[02:02:07.660 --> 02:02:11.660]  because I have those thoughts where I go maybe it's just the way it's always been
[02:02:11.660 --> 02:02:16.220]  it'll be alright it'll work itself out but it's not it's getting worse John B
[02:02:16.220 --> 02:02:19.740]  Wells you ever catch yourself trying to whitewash it yourself in your own mind
[02:02:19.740 --> 02:02:24.180]  whitewash it myself my own mind no I've driven everybody crazy over the years
[02:02:24.180 --> 02:02:30.300]  who had the misfortune to be around me when I'm analyzing these things no no
[02:02:30.300 --> 02:02:35.060]  I've been watching this for years and years and there the one of the things
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:40.580]  that I'm really grateful for is that with about a 90% accuracy I can
[02:02:40.580 --> 02:02:44.620]  remember little pieces of data that I just collect as time goes by so that
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:48.700]  later I've got a bunch of dots and I I found that it's pretty easy to connect
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:52.740]  them because the big lie is right out in front exactly that's all drudge does the
[02:02:52.740 --> 02:02:56.900]  White House's goes the drudge reports hurting us it only shows what they said
[02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:01.460]  a year ago a month ago last week today showing their liars they hate being
[02:03:01.460 --> 02:03:07.540]  called on it they hate our memories well sure I mean even Rush Limbaugh they're
[02:03:07.540 --> 02:03:11.980]  there that when the president says a rush Limbaugh is a problem and there and
[02:03:11.980 --> 02:03:15.140]  there's a quote from him that from not from Limbaugh but from there our
[02:03:15.140 --> 02:03:19.180]  president our current president that something effective well the the
[02:03:19.180 --> 02:03:23.220]  founder I'm paraphrasing the founding fathers have put a a system in place that
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:26.580]  makes it just a little bit harder for me to affect change than I would like it's
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:32.740]  like what and then the next thing at Ohio University he I really got some some
[02:03:32.740 --> 02:03:37.820]  bad emails on this one good good send them when I get a lot of flak it's like
[02:03:37.820 --> 02:03:40.860]  that old bomber pilot said when you're getting a lot of flak generally it means
[02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:45.140]  you're right over the target our president says reject these voices that
[02:03:45.140 --> 02:03:48.260]  suggests that there's a conspiracy and that the government is tyrannical and
[02:03:48.260 --> 02:03:52.260]  know that our great experiment will go forward and we're really good people up
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:55.660]  here I'm paraphrasing him heavily but that was the message and I said wouldn't
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:04:00.260]  have been better if he had said if you think that there's any tyranny creeping
[02:04:00.260 --> 02:04:04.300]  up on you absolutely investigated look at it because we're not about that but I
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:08.140]  think that backfired I agree because you know FBI says don't look at other
[02:04:08.140 --> 02:04:11.820]  photos of other bombers or the potential bombers and then Obama's like don't
[02:04:11.820 --> 02:04:15.060]  look at tyranny don't believe that could ever happen I mean that's that's a
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:20.860]  hundred and eighty degrees the opposite direction of common sense what's the
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:25.960]  opposite direction of the founding fathers doctrine yes I mean I mean don't
[02:04:25.960 --> 02:04:30.340]  look at tyranny trust the government I mean what don't run we are your friends
[02:04:30.340 --> 02:04:33.460]  it's like Mars attacks and they're shooting people stop and the aliens
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:41.180]  shoot them and then laugh I mean it might as well I swear if the media told
[02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:44.500]  the public to cement like aliens eating them they'd probably spring their kids
[02:04:44.500 --> 02:04:48.180]  the aliens are here to only eat one of your children this people would line them
[02:04:48.180 --> 02:04:52.380]  go I come in peace eat my child me they look like thank you I come in peace as

[02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:11.780]  going to Bilderberg to cover that that should be extremely interesting they're
[02:09:11.780 --> 02:09:16.700]  now announcing a free speech zone where protesters will be allowed to be in a
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:22.100]  field on the thousands of acres the grow bones inside the gate because they
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:25.140]  don't want you outside the gate where you can actually videotape the people
[02:09:25.140 --> 02:09:29.820]  but they will have private security they're doing a TSA grope downs no
[02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:33.580]  thank you I won't be going into their area I'll be outside the gates their
[02:09:33.580 --> 02:09:38.000]  videotaping the globalists coming in but that's how they work it everyone's
[02:09:38.000 --> 02:09:41.940]  oh they're so gracious to do this I how wonderful they're gonna stick us out in
[02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:46.100]  a field where we can't see anything with private security treating us like we're
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:50.780]  criminals while globalist criminals meet in secret but remember now it's in the
[02:09:50.780 --> 02:09:53.180]  British press they're meeting and that they're gonna have you know the feds
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:57.140]  and the military and private security out there for a group that doesn't have
[02:09:57.140 --> 02:10:01.340]  any power and that didn't exist before in fact we're going to your calls right
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:07.660]  now but John B. Wells again Coast Coast a.m. talk show host Saturday nights what
[02:10:07.660 --> 02:10:10.420]  do you make of the fact that global government didn't exist now they have
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:14.300]  to admit it and admit that it's authoritarian the bullets didn't exist
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:17.620]  but now they do but we're still coax thinking there's in the various reason
[02:10:17.620 --> 02:10:21.860]  or the the armored tanks didn't exist for us but now they do and oh the Army
[02:10:21.860 --> 02:10:25.380]  manuals for FEMA camps didn't exist but oh now they do but it's for a good
[02:10:25.380 --> 02:10:30.140]  reason or Bilderberg isn't real up until just five six years ago now it's real
[02:10:30.140 --> 02:10:35.540]  but we're bad to want to cover it and and yeah Bill Gates is having a secret
[02:10:35.540 --> 02:10:39.860]  eugenics conference with world leaders you know this week as well but the media
[02:10:39.860 --> 02:10:43.060]  doesn't need to cover that come on cooks you don't want to know what the guy
[02:10:43.060 --> 02:10:49.980]  that finances ABC news NBC news MSNBC now they say underwritten on the stories
[02:10:49.980 --> 02:10:57.060]  by Bill and the Gates Foundation I mean what would we do without them John B. Wells
[02:10:57.060 --> 02:11:03.820]  they're treating us like we're stupid and we are allowing them to continue to
[02:11:03.820 --> 02:11:09.220]  think that we're stupid because we do not in sufficient numbers call their
[02:11:09.220 --> 02:11:14.860]  sponsors email their sponsors mail their sponsors and tell them as long as
[02:11:14.860 --> 02:11:19.500]  you support this we're not buying your stuff it's like I like to say Alex if
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:24.860]  you want something to go away quit buying it whether it's a product whether
[02:11:24.860 --> 02:11:28.700]  it's a program or whether it's an ideology vote with your feet vote with
[02:11:28.700 --> 02:11:32.140]  your dollars but that's one of the last big powers we have and we're using it
[02:11:32.140 --> 02:11:36.780]  you now I want to ask you about that seeing in a year ago it's top show had a
[02:11:36.780 --> 02:11:41.100]  million viewers now it's 400,000 they are in free fall they're all in free fall
[02:11:41.100 --> 02:11:46.060]  even Fox is getting smaller but but you know it's falling down fast but miles
[02:11:46.060 --> 02:11:50.620]  above them to quote Helter Skelter so so you've got all this happening while the
[02:11:50.620 --> 02:11:57.060]  real media is exploding how are they gonna deal with that they're not gonna
[02:11:57.060 --> 02:12:03.020]  deal with it I really believe what is happening is that because of you and
[02:12:03.020 --> 02:12:09.900]  and people who are in league together in preserving this constitutional Republic
[02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:15.780]  these morons keep talking about it's a democracy no it's not democracy is mob
[02:12:15.780 --> 02:12:20.280]  rule this is a constitutional Republic you know you're the tip of the spear
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:29.340]  Alex you really are and I'm just happy to be part of the shaft you know but the
[02:12:29.340 --> 02:12:35.500]  people are waking up and as they wake up and as they say hey isn't what you're
[02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:40.260]  doing illegal well I was let's get a TV camera over here again I go back to Fox
[02:12:40.260 --> 02:12:43.820]  Fox News doesn't give me any money to talk about them I criticized a Fox
[02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:48.860]  reporter by name who walked past a woman who had in fact had been shot by
[02:12:48.860 --> 02:12:52.380]  during that you know the one the cops wounded like nine people up in New York
[02:12:52.380 --> 02:12:57.100]  City over this one guy that came out and oh she didn't see a bullet hole in the
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:13:00.900]  woman's body or and did not see any blood running out of her so she just
[02:13:00.900 --> 02:13:04.740]  walked past her so I'm not in bed with Fox News at all I just said that of the
[02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:11.300]  main news outlets I prefer them vastly over the others but the thing is is
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:15.780]  that Fox News is the only one as far as television is concerned mainstream
[02:13:15.780 --> 02:13:21.220]  television that was even covering any of the Benghazi stuff they're the ones that
[02:13:21.220 --> 02:13:24.940]  were running the the hearings today they would stop for commercials I know what
[02:13:24.940 --> 02:13:28.420]  they're doing now I don't just take glue to the TV thank God but people are
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:31.820]  waking up and every time we say you're doing something that's illegal
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:35.740]  inevitably the response is well I don't know I didn't know anything about that I
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:40.060]  mean they just let the guy go from the IRS who was gonna leave anyway at the end
[02:13:40.060 --> 02:13:45.700]  of June is the last thing that I heard on it so it's falling apart it's falling
[02:13:45.700 --> 02:13:51.820]  down around their necks and we have to keep the pressure up we have we you
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:55.380]  cannot get look at look at the furor that occurred over the other gun grab
[02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:59.660]  that they attempted these politicians figured out real quick we're gonna get
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:03.620]  thrown out of office next year if we go along with us now I'm not saying that all
[02:14:03.620 --> 02:14:07.500]  politicians are rotten there are a few of them up there that are they're good
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:10.300]  people and they believe in this constitutional republic but there are
[02:14:10.300 --> 02:14:14.780]  many others who are just gonna take what they can get feather their own nest
[02:14:14.780 --> 02:14:19.340]  and and then to hell with the people either the people are just useful idiots
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:23.220]  we all we need is their vote that's all we don't need anything else there are a
[02:14:23.220 --> 02:14:26.940]  lot of them up there they're like that they just want the power but it's
[02:14:26.940 --> 02:14:31.420]  wearing thin I believe Alex we're gonna win I think we may get a little bit
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:36.180]  messy we may even get a little bit bloody but we're going to win look we're
[02:14:36.180 --> 02:14:38.780]  all dead we're all dead anyway everybody's gonna check out of this
[02:14:38.780 --> 02:14:42.980]  world at some time absolutely it comes really quick doesn't seem like five
[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:47.180]  minutes ago that you were ten years old oh absolutely I remember my teen years
[02:14:47.180 --> 02:14:50.700]  like it was two weeks ago but the thing is you don't you want to stand for
[02:14:50.700 --> 02:14:56.580]  something while you're alive I mean we all went through the the the the SDR and
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:15:01.580]  our thing back when we were encouraged to behave that way many of us have I was
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:06.380]  a rock and roll jock in Dallas Texas and believe me there was access to all
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:11.980]  sorts of things that that are not good for you but many of us have decided you
[02:15:11.980 --> 02:15:16.820]  know if we hadn't had the encouragement and pretty much the license to behave as
[02:15:16.820 --> 02:15:21.340]  we did don't think we would have done it but people get drunk on what little bit
[02:15:21.340 --> 02:15:26.020]  of power that they have and and power is good say it's good to be king even if
[02:15:26.020 --> 02:15:29.660]  it's of just a tiny little kingdom it's better than being you know this the
[02:15:29.660 --> 02:15:34.940]  stable boy and people are people and they're going to do what is in their
[02:15:34.940 --> 02:15:38.740]  best interest first it takes a little bit of reaching down into the soul and
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:45.980]  saying I can do this but should I what mark is it gonna leave on me on my
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:49.980]  character what's gonna be written in the book up there in the sky metaphorically
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:53.860]  speaking I use the gross analogy of a pool you know public pools have to have
[02:15:53.860 --> 02:15:57.620]  ten times the chlorine and they're unswimmable because everybody is peeing
[02:15:57.620 --> 02:16:02.020]  in it and then I'll get up if I'm at a public pool somewhere on a trip or
[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:05.060]  something and go to the restroom I notice no one else is doing it I mean
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:09.180]  why not stop yeah I mean why not start actually doing the other thing in the
[02:16:09.180 --> 02:16:13.260]  pool and it's like when everybody starts screwing everybody and then other
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:16.340]  people think that's how you get ahead than everybody starts doing it the
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:21.780]  society becomes North Korea or Mexico well yes that's that's absolutely true
[02:16:21.780 --> 02:16:29.620]  and to allow a cadre of anti and when I say anti-American what I mean is
[02:16:29.620 --> 02:16:36.180]  anti-constitutional republic anti the only country that's ever existed in in
[02:16:36.180 --> 02:16:42.940]  recorded history that had this kind of governance by the people of and for the
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:51.180]  people any cadre of people like this that are anti-American values is about
[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:56.980]  like having a peeing section in the pool that's right or something else that's
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:17:00.020]  even worse I guess like it's like putting a sewage dirt you know the sewage
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:05.340]  pipe directly from the bathroom into the pool and and then who's the IRS go
[02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:09.100]  after those that quote teach the Constitution that was actually in the
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:12.540]  inspector generals that the thing was it are they talking about the Constitution
[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:16.900]  it's like police manuals they make frequent references to the Constitution
[02:17:16.900 --> 02:17:23.060]  put them in the terror database cops you swore to that you idiot and I know most
[02:17:23.060 --> 02:17:25.780]  the cops aren't idiots and know that it's just we're in so much trouble and
[02:17:25.780 --> 02:17:31.300]  it's so obvious the bad guys are the ones that demonize the founding documents
[02:17:31.300 --> 02:17:37.940]  I just let's talk to Casey sure old white guys they call them who wants to
[02:17:37.940 --> 02:17:41.980]  listen to a bunch of old white guys I mean what is that okay well they said we
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:45.860]  should be able to own guns property they have warrants to come in our house a lot
[02:17:45.860 --> 02:17:49.900]  of good stuff I don't care if they were old purple guys or green guys Casey in
[02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:56.060]  Texas you're on the air with a couple old white guys go ahead Casey Alex John
[02:17:56.060 --> 02:18:00.980]  first of all thanks for having me on John just said something that you know
[02:18:00.980 --> 02:18:05.540]  now is that a cross-point about three weeks ago something really important I
[02:18:05.540 --> 02:18:09.500]  don't you want to stand for something while you're alive and I know you don't
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:13.380]  like to be thanked Alex I know that but I do have to personally thank you and I'll
[02:18:13.380 --> 02:18:17.820]  tell you why that Pierce Morgan when you're on that interview and you said
[02:18:17.820 --> 02:18:22.620]  if you try to take our guns away the Republic will rise again and that stuck
[02:18:22.620 --> 02:18:27.540]  out in my mind so much it inspired me I wrote a song it's called the Republic is
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:33.140]  gonna rise again it's g o n and a it's already out on iTunes I made a YouTube
[02:18:33.140 --> 02:18:38.820]  video but that's all I pretty much covers everything the RFID chip well yeah
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:42.940]  and I told him if you push too hard you'll wake the slaves up and then it's
[02:18:42.940 --> 02:18:47.260]  game over and he had 2 million viewers that night instead of like 600,000 at
[02:18:47.260 --> 02:18:50.700]  the time now it's 400,000 he is hemorrhaging out but they won't have me
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:55.580]  back on because they said we didn't like the message you put out I knew it was
[02:18:55.580 --> 02:18:58.940]  going to be big I told my whole family of course my dad's still asleep he
[02:18:58.940 --> 02:19:02.780]  wouldn't listen but you know I have a kid with autism and that makes me mad
[02:19:02.780 --> 02:19:07.100]  enough you know so but by listening to that it really inspired me to write the
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:10.740]  Republic is gonna rise again I'll tell you exactly how they're gonna bring the
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:15.300]  RFID chip if I get killed for this you know they can kill my body but real
[02:19:15.300 --> 02:19:20.660]  Christians don't die so my spirit will go to heaven but um this is what they're
[02:19:20.660 --> 02:19:25.180]  gonna do with all these celebrities you see coming out that gun control and
[02:19:25.180 --> 02:19:27.780]  everything oh yeah the woman chops both their breasts off all the other people
[02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:30.780]  run out to get it immediately they'll come out and say it's the trendy thing
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:34.220]  to have a chip that's what Vera Chip said that 12 years ago they were gonna
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:38.220]  use that go ahead well what they're gonna do they're gonna use people that
[02:19:38.220 --> 02:19:42.380]  can influence public opinion like Oprah Winfrey and they're gonna get chipped and
[02:19:42.380 --> 02:19:46.900]  they're gonna say look I got it isn't it cool you can get it too and I've already
[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:49.340]  done that they've already done that they're already giving special forces
[02:19:49.340 --> 02:19:53.380]  chips for at least five years and again I'm sad for women that get breast cancer
[02:19:53.380 --> 02:19:57.620]  I've had it in my family it's terrible you know I hate it they try to use the
[02:19:57.620 --> 02:20:01.980]  celebrities to say turn your guns in they've done that over and over and over
[02:20:01.980 --> 02:20:06.420]  again but I'm glad that you I'm glad that you raised that because Angelina
[02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:11.780]  Jo Lee was into hurting herself into into darkness you can look this up into
[02:20:11.780 --> 02:20:17.580]  blood into weird dark occultic stuff very screwed up young lady I don't think
[02:20:17.580 --> 02:20:20.460]  she consciously because I don't think there's evidence of that there's
[02:20:20.460 --> 02:20:23.700]  companies out there promoting everybody should get this gene test that's paid
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:29.180]  for with Obamacare for $4,000 to you know that I agree with is a big scam but
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:32.940]  but you know to take both their breasts off because her mother died of this out
[02:20:32.940 --> 02:20:37.940]  of the fear why aren't we asking why is it exploding chemicals in the
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:42.980]  environment then triggering predisposition in genetics we already had
[02:20:42.980 --> 02:20:46.740]  these genetics to have breast cancer why is it up a couple thousand percent in
[02:20:46.740 --> 02:20:50.780]  the United States leading the world in the last 50 years because we know it's
[02:20:50.780 --> 02:20:56.940]  the Bisphenol a we know it's the GMO it gives breast cancer to female rats to
[02:20:56.940 --> 02:21:02.860]  female guinea pigs we know why but I mean why wouldn't she come out and say
[02:21:02.860 --> 02:21:06.820]  look at these studies on GMO then we could get awareness and do it that's
[02:21:06.820 --> 02:21:11.180]  why I hate her is because she's so dark and ignorant they can get her to go
[02:21:11.180 --> 02:21:15.540]  along with this I don't think she's consciously involved cutting her breast
[02:21:15.540 --> 02:21:20.340]  having her both double mastectomies because she wants to go get money so
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:24.180]  that these globalists they're just using her to be part of this as a useful
[02:21:24.180 --> 02:21:29.940]  idiot but the point is is that you know what's next well brain tumors are up so
[02:21:29.940 --> 02:21:33.340]  we're gonna everybody have their brains removed or let's have all girls when
[02:21:33.340 --> 02:21:36.300]  they hit puberty you know they're talking about that have their breast
[02:21:36.300 --> 02:21:40.740]  removed you know I mean we're losing our humanity because they're doing it on
[02:21:40.740 --> 02:21:48.340]  purpose then they hype the solution that is just a new holocaust one in 25,000
[02:21:48.340 --> 02:21:52.580]  30 years ago at autism it's one in 50 something folks they're killing us John
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:57.620]  B. Wells I appreciate your call-caller John B. Wells your take on that on
[02:21:57.620 --> 02:22:06.980]  Angelina yes sir on the one hand here's the thing I understand how two good
[02:22:06.980 --> 02:22:12.500]  lawyers can go into a into a courtroom one I'm gonna walk out the loser I can
[02:22:12.500 --> 02:22:17.540]  understand how a case can be made for things depending on the mentality and
[02:22:17.540 --> 02:22:22.740]  also the mentality of the judge I think we know that Angelina Jolie is a little
[02:22:22.740 --> 02:22:27.140]  bit she's a little bit out there on the edge and there are some things about her
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:30.460]  that I admire I mean I admire the fact that she's a pilot that she's had a
[02:22:30.460 --> 02:22:34.700]  good career I understand she and her dad John Voight are a little bit cross ways
[02:22:34.700 --> 02:22:38.260]  so probably ideologically and that whole thing with Billy Bob Thornton and the
[02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:41.860]  little vials of blood that they used to wear around their necks and so forth so
[02:22:41.860 --> 02:22:46.060]  I mean I think she's a good artist but I think she's a little bit of a freak but
[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:49.860]  unfortunately it goes back to that does life imitate art or does art imitate
[02:22:49.860 --> 02:22:54.380]  life my answer is both first life imitate our first art imitates life and
[02:22:54.380 --> 02:23:01.940]  then life imitates art and people are impressionable some people are gonna
[02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:06.260]  follow I mean look at that bunch out there and in in San Diego some years
[02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:09.780]  ago that decided to go ahead we'll just all check ourselves out and catch up to
[02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:16.100]  the UFO out there in the tail of the hail bop kind heavens gate I mean there
[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:20.380]  there are the fact of the matter is is that ignorance can be cured but
[02:23:20.380 --> 02:23:24.700]  stupidity is somewhat permanent sure sure my issue is there's never a
[02:23:24.700 --> 02:23:29.580]  discussion why is autism exploding and then oh it's a conspiracy theory it's
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:32.820]  the pesticides there's a conspiracy theory it's the vaccines it's a
[02:23:32.820 --> 02:23:36.580]  conspiracy and I meant to ask the caller every person I talked to when did
[02:23:36.580 --> 02:23:39.540]  yours when did it happen why is it a boy because the boys don't have strong
[02:23:39.540 --> 02:23:43.180]  blood-brain barriers like girls any doctor will tell you a baby girl of any
[02:23:43.180 --> 02:23:46.700]  mammal species is stronger than a male because women got to be able to you know
[02:23:46.700 --> 02:23:50.780]  deal with infection you name it women have a stronger blood-brain barrier as
[02:23:50.780 --> 02:23:55.420]  surgeons will tell you women quit bleeding quicker women are tougher
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:24:00.020]  women are better overall that they're soft and sweet because they're
[02:24:00.020 --> 02:24:05.180]  nurturative men are there to compete with each other for the species and to
[02:24:05.180 --> 02:24:11.300]  defend women physically and to fight and to die to build a civilization okay and
[02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:15.020]  then and then women are humanity they're the ones that create the children the
[02:24:15.020 --> 02:24:19.220]  whole deal they have the mitochondrial DNA they have more genetics than men do
[02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:23.540]  and of course men and women make the species but the women I'd say are two
[02:24:23.540 --> 02:24:27.380]  thirds of the species and that's why it's under attack and so what let's not
[02:24:27.380 --> 02:24:31.460]  ask why are women are all getting breast cancer why it's up two thousand three
[02:24:31.460 --> 02:24:36.140]  thousand percent why the US leads it worldwide let's just go chop the women's
[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:41.900]  breast off I mean I mean again it's just it's it's out of control we need to say
[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:48.180]  why is it happening why why why not sever your breast you can just get some
[02:24:48.180 --> 02:24:55.020]  other cancer folks that's right and and you know Alex this this civilization
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:59.740]  of ours has been referred to repeatedly as our grand experiment and I would
[02:24:59.740 --> 02:25:07.380]  submit to you and the audience that scientists are running it well yes to a
[02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:11.860]  degree I'm sorry grand experiment no no I'm with you that's really kind of where
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:18.100]  I was headed it's the next experiment is to see what it will take to dismantle a
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:22.820]  free society people aren't even aware that and I don't want to offend any
[02:25:22.820 --> 02:25:26.540]  servicemen out there but I went through the Vietnam era I carried a 1-a draft
[02:25:26.540 --> 02:25:29.980]  card sorry about that they just they just never called me up the only reason I
[02:25:29.980 --> 02:25:33.540]  didn't go that's probably good I did not probably still be in Lucy's tiger bar
[02:25:33.540 --> 02:25:40.500]  somewhere or tiger den but the thing is is we now have a mercenary army and when
[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:43.500]  I watch these commercials roll over I mean let's just think about what we're
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:48.820]  seeing and how numbed our brains and our perceptions are becoming if you look at
[02:25:48.820 --> 02:25:53.780]  I mentioned before the Fox News outfit I'm looking at that and the next thing
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:58.420]  that I see is either a wounded warrior project which of course our soldiers
[02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:02.580]  should be helped anybody should be held but they shouldn't be sent for five six
[02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:07.460]  seven tours and given deadly drugs but then the answer is oh feel sorry for them
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:12.460]  absolutely like that makes it okay and I'm sorry go ahead well no and then
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:16.340]  speaking of drugs the next thing is that did you take any of these drugs that by
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:21.540]  the way the FDA approved well if you just if you suffer death a dismemberment

[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:58.060]  imaginary there's a drug for it and the next thing you see is oh it's a bad drug
[02:26:58.060 --> 02:27:05.900]  call this attorney this experiment is turning somewhat nasty I do believe
[02:27:05.900 --> 02:27:11.260]  that we will win I really do but we're gonna have to wake up the army people
[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:15.340]  are gonna have to you can't just get mad in spurts there are a lot of screens
[02:27:15.340 --> 02:27:20.860]  up I understand this there are a lot of issues to deal with IRS gun control
[02:27:20.860 --> 02:27:25.940]  immigration and let's see what up what are you feeding us why does the state
[02:27:25.940 --> 02:27:30.340]  make people put fluoride back in their water after the municipalities just
[02:27:30.340 --> 02:27:35.740]  thought we're getting rid of it UCLA released a study three four months ago
[02:27:35.740 --> 02:27:42.460]  that said fluoride in water retards the mental development of children period
[02:27:42.460 --> 02:27:49.340]  end of story it does well it's still in there so we have to rise up we simply
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:54.940]  have to rise up we have to do something your government is not your friend and
[02:27:54.940 --> 02:28:00.220]  that's the thing the public's already so mentally deficient now from 60 years of
[02:28:00.220 --> 02:28:05.100]  hydrofluoricic acid fluoride that they can't even get upset and if you go to
[02:28:05.100 --> 02:28:11.060]  the city council with Harvard scientists they literally the mayor laughs and
[02:28:11.060 --> 02:28:15.940]  they all will turn their chairs around and giggle mm-hmm and I mean these guys
[02:28:15.940 --> 02:28:19.860]  grandkids are all getting their pineal gland shot there but it's like they
[02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:24.180]  think laughing about it will keep them safe so the banks are like well take
[02:28:24.180 --> 02:28:28.260]  your pension funds are gonna laugh at that too but they are hey they said NATO
[02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:31.540]  can be the command of the military now how about just say the military's now in
[02:28:31.540 --> 02:28:38.540]  command yeah I mean it's all just like you know I've been there and I've seen
[02:28:38.540 --> 02:28:44.500]  the videos when we fly in Harvard scientists in and you know you name it
[02:28:44.500 --> 02:28:48.380]  and it's in the New York Times having to admit okay 20-something studies it

[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:23.780]  all right I've got some financial news I want to hit I want to play a piece of a
[02:33:23.780 --> 02:33:29.260]  newscast where robbers shove homeowner in closet where he kept his guns yeah you
[02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:33.820]  don't want to shove me in my closet get in there get in the closet oh really in
[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:37.860]  this closet right here where I've got like eight handguns and a shotgun okay
[02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:41.620]  let me this is terrible that you've locked me up in here and then he shot
[02:33:41.620 --> 02:33:45.500]  them and the media the newscast is police are not going to be charging the
[02:33:45.500 --> 02:33:49.540]  homeowner always that implication you know if you stab somebody in your own
[02:33:49.540 --> 02:33:55.300]  home who's raping you you can pull up the BBC articles BBC articles they then
[02:33:55.300 --> 02:34:00.300]  indict you well you you've heard the stories here where the robber falls to
[02:34:00.300 --> 02:34:06.700]  the skylight sues and wins you need to have robbers safe skylights up there so
[02:34:06.700 --> 02:34:11.540]  that they don't fall through and break their leg and it's because criminals now
[02:34:11.540 --> 02:34:16.060]  run the system at many levels and they want to be protected it's like they've
[02:34:16.060 --> 02:34:19.820]  gotten rid of all the IRS enforcers on billionaires and people that's why
[02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:23.020]  they're allowed to be tax exempt because it's all selectively enforced but you
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:25.740]  make two hundred thousand dollars a year oh they're gonna rake you over the
[02:34:25.740 --> 02:34:29.980]  coals there's no way they've written the tax code that's in the news today where
[02:34:29.980 --> 02:34:36.740]  it's impossible it's impossible to ever pay it where they can't later claim you
[02:34:36.740 --> 02:34:40.100]  did something wrong and give you penalties and interest it's the whole
[02:34:40.100 --> 02:34:46.940]  thing I was talking to a police detective the other day and he said look
[02:34:46.940 --> 02:34:51.300]  here in Austin he said look he goes we're not allowed to go after the
[02:34:51.300 --> 02:34:54.300]  motorcycle gangs the particular ones he was naming because you know the
[02:34:54.300 --> 02:34:57.660]  government lets them run the drugs the argument is so the worst you know
[02:34:57.660 --> 02:35:02.540]  Mexican drug cartels that are even more ruthless don't control it that's what
[02:35:02.540 --> 02:35:06.340]  brzezinski writes about in a couple of his books I read yes we control the
[02:35:06.340 --> 02:35:10.260]  criminal networks because then we can control it's not that it get too out of
[02:35:10.260 --> 02:35:16.500]  hand I mean that's always the excuse we grow the opium so the Taliban doesn't
[02:35:16.500 --> 02:35:19.940]  get it and then they increase it you know ten times the production at least
[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:25.900]  looked that up 93% of world opium production since the US liberated
[02:35:25.900 --> 02:35:31.580]  Afghanistan from like 9% of world production and yeah he's sitting there
[02:35:31.580 --> 02:35:34.260]  telling me this and I already knew all this but I mean I've talked to LAP
[02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:41.660]  detectives I even have been in events several times it had like the real you
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:45.220]  hear about the legendary Vikings the police gang out in LA let me tell you're
[02:35:45.220 --> 02:35:47.420]  hanging around with the biggest Hollywood stars that's who's around folks
[02:35:47.420 --> 02:35:50.900]  that's why those Hollywood stars are basically above the law because it's
[02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:56.020]  all gangsterism and the thing is they're not naive then they're like well I
[02:35:56.020 --> 02:35:59.620]  don't like what we do but you know if we didn't do it somebody else would it's
[02:35:59.620 --> 02:36:03.140]  like that argument but then once you give into that the sky's the limit I'm
[02:36:03.140 --> 02:36:06.820]  going back to calls with yote Eric Phil and others but what's your take on what
[02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:11.460]  I was just saying there because there's this argument of you guard the good by
[02:36:11.460 --> 02:36:15.140]  being more evil than the evil well when you dance with the devil he doesn't
[02:36:15.140 --> 02:36:22.220]  change you change well as long as we're gonna mention the devil the devil is
[02:36:22.220 --> 02:36:25.780]  the master deceiver so of course they've got to have some argument that goes
[02:36:25.780 --> 02:36:29.860]  back to what I mentioned earlier about two lawyers go in and one of them walks
[02:36:29.860 --> 02:36:33.260]  out the loser they're both equally qualified I think the best way to
[02:36:33.260 --> 02:36:37.340]  address that Alex is just to say that I got some flak over this which of course
[02:36:37.340 --> 02:36:40.700]  I'm delighted when I get flack from the from the left wing because that means I
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:45.540]  tweaked him up raise their blood pressure I like doing that there I quote
[02:36:45.540 --> 02:36:50.420]  from my iron Rand and Atlas shrugged when she was talking to one of the
[02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:55.180]  characters there's a dialogue in the in the story and then the man said you're
[02:36:55.180 --> 02:36:59.460]  not up against a bunch of Boy Scouts up here we want power and we're going to
[02:36:59.460 --> 02:37:03.860]  get it what's in it to have a law-abiding abiding society nothing a
[02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:09.700]  government can't control innocent men so what you do is you continue to concoct
[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:14.460]  laws and make everyone guilty of something because the only thing that
[02:37:14.460 --> 02:37:20.580]  the state can do is come down and crush the criminal and they leave escape
[02:37:20.580 --> 02:37:25.260]  patches for themselves and they're exempt always always I think that some of
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:29.220]  these people up in Washington right now names that we both know I think they
[02:37:29.220 --> 02:37:32.540]  need to go to jail I think they need their assets sealed and I would just take
[02:37:32.540 --> 02:37:38.380]  this opportunity to say people take your power back if you want to bring this
[02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:44.620]  nonsense to a halt defund it they can't do anything without money you have a
[02:37:44.620 --> 02:37:49.900]  mercenary army now I don't give a damn what anybody thinks about that it's a
[02:37:49.900 --> 02:37:54.900]  fact do you see Jack Richard we used to read the the great books and so forth
[02:37:54.900 --> 02:37:58.380]  and we still do but some of the script writers are very very good and I saw
[02:37:58.380 --> 02:38:01.460]  Richard that was a good movie you remember what he said we talk about the
[02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:04.260]  sniper and he said you know some people join the army because they want to serve
[02:38:04.260 --> 02:38:08.020]  some of them get kind of have to do it they need a job but some of them do it
[02:38:08.020 --> 02:38:13.060]  as a legal means of killing people and so I would submit to you that there is a
[02:38:13.060 --> 02:38:20.660]  measurable percentage of persons in the force department the first time they
[02:38:20.660 --> 02:38:24.740]  they stopped calling them peace officers and start and stop talking about law and
[02:38:24.740 --> 02:38:28.700]  order and it became law enforcement that was the first flag that was read and the
[02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:33.820]  police force yes the police force not the police department the police force
[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:39.980]  all you have to do to take the wind of these sales is defund it well expect
[02:38:39.980 --> 02:38:43.140]  but they stage things or let things happen so they get more funding and then
[02:38:43.140 --> 02:38:46.780]  they kick the good people out because there are there are people that join
[02:38:46.780 --> 02:38:49.820]  because of family history the people that join because of an instinct to serve
[02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:52.660]  and defend like Pat Tillman there's people that join because they need the
[02:38:52.660 --> 02:38:56.060]  money people that enjoy because they want to be psychopaths and kill people
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:01.540]  but there's also people like I have family that I knew 20 years ago when they
[02:39:01.540 --> 02:39:04.860]  joined the army were one person because I'd go hunting fishing with them and
[02:39:04.860 --> 02:39:10.940]  after it's not even now it's it's like Hurt Locker they have been in so much
[02:39:10.940 --> 02:39:15.780]  combat seen so many things they're not awake till they get in a firefight
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:19.260]  they're not awake till they come out of helicopters you know and all over the
[02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:23.060]  world they're not awake till they're in a knife fight with somebody they're not
[02:39:23.060 --> 02:39:26.340]  awake till they're stripping down an engine and fixing it real fast they're
[02:39:26.340 --> 02:39:29.500]  not awake till they go climbing up a mountain they're not awake till they get
[02:39:29.500 --> 02:39:33.140]  in a bar room fight they're not awake till they and the big thing is it's not
[02:39:33.140 --> 02:39:38.100]  even that they want it's just they want they want they want to kill but but but
[02:39:38.100 --> 02:39:41.860]  it's not just in a psychopathic way they want to be being shot back at as well
[02:39:41.860 --> 02:39:46.500]  so that group I can even halfway respect but they're creatures of long term
[02:39:46.500 --> 02:39:50.540]  really post-traumatic stress disorder but instead of collapsing in it they
[02:39:50.540 --> 02:39:54.340]  thrive in it you know what I'm talking about absolutely I do and you had a
[02:39:54.340 --> 02:39:59.300]  story you I think you were the first one with the story on info wars about the
[02:39:59.300 --> 02:40:04.460]  classification that Jenna Napolitano has put on returning vets so it's just like
[02:40:04.460 --> 02:40:08.780]  going back to scripture that's what the devil does if he can't get you a drug
[02:40:08.780 --> 02:40:13.820]  overdose and kill you he'll settle for five years a hard time for a intent to
[02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:19.060]  distribute the the evil dark force will use you on they'll play they'll pin
[02:40:19.060 --> 02:40:22.340]  metals on you and they'll patch you on the back and tell you a great job son
[02:40:22.340 --> 02:40:26.940]  great job gal and then as soon as your usefulness is spent he'll just throw you
[02:40:26.940 --> 02:40:30.540]  under the bus just bump you off you're done next that's what's going on now
[02:40:30.540 --> 02:40:34.820]  with with these health issues they don't want us living into our 80s and 90s or
[02:40:34.820 --> 02:40:39.140]  any of that they want us they want to act about 30 years of productive I have
[02:40:39.140 --> 02:40:43.300]  the scientists on I have they inject the troops on record with
[02:40:43.300 --> 02:40:48.260]  experimental vaccines that have virus plaques that that embed in the cells
[02:40:48.260 --> 02:40:52.380]  that are designed to trigger when hormone levels go down and then you get
[02:40:52.380 --> 02:40:57.380]  cancer 5560 when they're done with you I mean we're all being given time to lay
[02:40:57.380 --> 02:41:02.260]  death bombs basically Alex if this thing is allowed to go as far as it could go
[02:41:02.260 --> 02:41:06.540]  what you will have is the same way it is in the same way that I said one of
[02:41:06.540 --> 02:41:09.260]  these days you're gonna be looking I understand Japan's already done it
[02:41:09.260 --> 02:41:12.820]  actually you'll be looking at a news anchor that you think is a real person
[02:41:12.820 --> 02:41:16.740]  and it's not it's a beautifully done computer they've already announced that
[02:41:16.740 --> 02:41:20.740]  the president doesn't just have Robo signers they're saying next year they
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:25.780]  may they've already got it built a 3d projection of Obama that they just type
[02:41:25.780 --> 02:41:29.740]  the words in and then he can appear anywhere to school kids whatever and
[02:41:29.740 --> 02:41:34.100]  they'll kind of think they saw Obama well some of these visionaries like Lucas
[02:41:34.100 --> 02:41:37.980]  and the Star Wars thing they're very well may be a war of the clone the clone
[02:41:37.980 --> 02:41:43.300]  wars once they decide we only want these people we don't we don't want that type
[02:41:43.300 --> 02:41:46.220]  we don't want this body type we don't want that appearance we don't want that
[02:41:46.220 --> 02:41:50.220]  hair color they can they can do that do you know that this this thing that was
[02:41:50.220 --> 02:41:54.380]  science fiction maybe 10 years ago which of course that means it's it's been
[02:41:54.380 --> 02:41:57.860]  looked it's been investigated and experimented with oh yeah oh yeah for
[02:41:57.860 --> 02:42:05.100]  years now they're actually able to to target races with dis with fatal
[02:42:05.100 --> 02:42:08.980]  disease specific bio weapons yeah expanding they came out yesterday went
[02:42:08.980 --> 02:42:12.900]  oh they we can now clone and then you read the fine print because I remember
[02:42:12.900 --> 02:42:18.940]  reading it 16 years ago 16 years ago in BBC is first admitted in London they
[02:42:18.940 --> 02:42:23.740]  admitted clones of humans but they go it's okay we don't bring them to term and
[02:42:23.740 --> 02:42:28.660]  now they go well we bring them to term but that's classify what we do but they're
[02:42:28.660 --> 02:42:34.020]  part animal so they don't have rights so the the shampoo says no bunny rabbits
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:37.580]  were tested on you're like oh good good but then but then you understand there
[02:42:37.580 --> 02:42:41.740]  are humanoid creatures they brought to term this is in the literature but but
[02:42:41.740 --> 02:42:45.660]  but the news only and this is getting into like you know regular coast to coast
[02:42:45.660 --> 02:42:50.060]  AM type stuff but that's not speculation in the medical literature and now
[02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:54.460]  they're going these new clones can be brought to term and they're telling us
[02:42:54.460 --> 02:42:59.980]  about 25 30 year old stuff my friend let me tell you go you go back to Anthony
[02:42:59.980 --> 02:43:03.380]  Burgess and you go back to the guy who wrote Clockwork Orange and another book
[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:07.100]  he wrote called The Wanting Seed and all of these visionaries Bradbury and
[02:43:07.100 --> 02:43:12.540]  Asimov and Heinlein that this is this is going to happen I I could imagine a
[02:43:12.540 --> 02:43:18.380]  futuristic a la science fiction a scenario where you have the power elite
[02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:24.780]  who remain at the at the peak of their physical development and then they
[02:43:24.780 --> 02:43:28.260]  rotate the clones through they got a life expectancy no no no they say you're
[02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:33.460]  gonna have to have money to be able to go and just live because because you
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:36.820]  know well you again you're gonna have to pay for the genetic treatment so your
[02:43:36.820 --> 02:43:43.180]  breast don't have to be cut off well sure and and we can either wait and just
[02:43:43.180 --> 02:43:47.260]  kind of watch this unfold as we as William Wallace said in the in the
[02:43:47.260 --> 02:43:52.620]  picture again you know you'll you'll live for a while and just watch this
[02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:57.980]  unfold or we can decide what are the pillars of civilization go back to the
[02:43:57.980 --> 02:44:03.180]  ancient philosophers who were trying to write down in permanence what makes a
[02:44:03.180 --> 02:44:08.020]  good life and cling to that or let these idiots have their way these evil
[02:44:08.020 --> 02:44:14.660]  stupid people who by the way like you said their fruits are rivers of rotting
[02:44:14.660 --> 02:44:23.900]  scruffulous I mean in rivers of stinking failure yes endless failures the
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:29.340]  society is getting worse and worse and yet in the in the great balance of
[02:44:29.340 --> 02:44:33.660]  things I really believe the people are waking up and those who will not wake
[02:44:33.660 --> 02:44:38.620]  up we're not going to be able to wake them up they will oppose you they will
[02:44:38.620 --> 02:44:42.660]  oppose me they will oppose anything that constitutes any sort of moral
[02:44:42.660 --> 02:44:46.060]  character because they lust after degeneracy they like get off on it there
[02:44:46.060 --> 02:44:49.980]  they're saying it's gonna be a wonderful future yoke in Kansas you're on the air
[02:44:49.980 --> 02:45:01.740]  go ahead thanks for holding so much you guys are talking about you are the tip
[02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:05.060]  of the spear the other day you said you're the preacher you should be the
[02:45:05.060 --> 02:45:09.780]  chief you should be there in skin the contest is awesome they probably want
[02:45:09.780 --> 02:45:14.420]  to tear your guts out like William Wallace I recently had a little baby
[02:45:14.420 --> 02:45:20.660]  girl and her my wife's mother is super strong just like the strong women you're
[02:45:20.660 --> 02:45:27.660]  talking about really intelligent and would never say that she is we opted
[02:45:27.660 --> 02:45:31.220]  out not to vaccinate the next day the doctor came out said oh I saw that you're
[02:45:31.220 --> 02:45:35.420]  not gonna vaccinate your baby you know she could be a threat to society and he
[02:45:35.420 --> 02:45:38.900]  just wanted to engage me my wife was like oh you should have engaged him he
[02:45:38.900 --> 02:45:44.820]  just wants to show you that you're smarter my father never he's of the same
[02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:49.020]  age of the gentleman it's on there today he was a Coast to Coast listener he's
[02:45:49.020 --> 02:45:52.940]  not here anymore he loved all those writers he was just talking about and
[02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:57.300]  he always told me and my brother do not be in the military don't be part of it
[02:45:57.300 --> 02:46:03.580]  my brother was accepted the Air Force Academy he hated it and you know we're
[02:46:03.580 --> 02:46:07.980]  with you don't talk about leaving talk with power you got a fight you're the
[02:46:07.980 --> 02:46:14.020]  no no I just get depressed by watching them hurt innocent people and again my
[02:46:14.020 --> 02:46:19.500]  empathy is my strength it's your strength but it just it hurts because it's so
[02:46:19.500 --> 02:46:24.260]  obvious now and how much more obvious when I got up this morning and Watson
[02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:26.980]  said have you seen this and I went and looked at it and looked at the documents
[02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:31.420]  and I went my god they're gonna say the military is now outside even the
[02:46:31.420 --> 02:46:36.060]  president I mean it's just that even shocked me it's so over the top and
[02:46:36.060 --> 02:46:40.860]  that it's moving this quick and it's really kind of a a nostalgia for
[02:46:40.860 --> 02:46:44.700]  freedom and and then realizing things are only gonna get worse and before they
[02:46:44.700 --> 02:46:49.380]  get better it's just wishing this didn't have to happen you know it's kind of
[02:46:49.380 --> 02:46:53.140]  like that feeling where you did the light turns green you drive out this
[02:46:53.140 --> 02:46:56.340]  happened to me once and you look over and some idiot ran the red light going
[02:46:56.340 --> 02:47:00.100]  50 miles an hour and you and it's like only two seconds but it seems like five
[02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:04.740]  minutes so yeah and you think man I wish I'd have looked I wish that idiot
[02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:08.340]  wouldn't have read that run run that red light and then you start gripping the
[02:47:08.340 --> 02:47:12.900]  steering wheel and gripping your teeth going oh man I can't believe people it's
[02:47:12.900 --> 02:47:17.780]  like a big long thought goes on about man why why did not do it why are they
[02:47:17.780 --> 02:47:22.780]  look at him oh my god they're talking on their you know phone or oh my gosh oh
[02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:26.460]  there's there's kids in the backseat I hope they don't get hurt oh man this is
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:31.300]  just oh I wish this wasn't gonna happen boom I mean you know and and that is
[02:47:31.300 --> 02:47:35.700]  exactly what it's like I'm just sitting there going oh it's really and so many
[02:47:35.700 --> 02:47:39.460]  other cars have hit us that weren't as big you know now bigger and bigger ones
[02:47:39.460 --> 02:47:43.300]  are smashing into us and I'm like when do we get off this merry-go-round when
[02:47:43.300 --> 02:47:45.980]  do people get out of their trance because the thing is as it gets worse
[02:47:45.980 --> 02:47:49.940]  and worse more people are only going to give into it more like you're gonna have
[02:47:49.940 --> 02:47:53.420]  a splitting those of us to get more awake and the and people that just will
[02:47:53.420 --> 02:47:57.340]  buy anything John yes they will and and the reason that I brought up the
[02:47:57.340 --> 02:48:01.220]  mercenary of the mercenary army part is that I don't want anybody to get there
[02:48:01.220 --> 02:48:04.300]  some fine law enforcement people out there I know some of them and I like
[02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:09.140]  them there's some nice excellent people evil is in control of the system well I
[02:48:09.140 --> 02:48:13.860]  don't have think anyone should be under any illusions that the police and the
[02:48:13.860 --> 02:48:16.820]  military won't fire on citizens they will they've done it before look what
[02:48:16.820 --> 02:48:20.140]  happened in Boston now did you see the part about the marks a lot message
[02:48:20.140 --> 02:48:25.980]  inside the cabin of the boat oh yeah I mean how ludicrous is this as it
[02:48:25.980 --> 02:48:31.140]  reminds me that's so-called suicide note that Vince Foster left behind after his
[02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:36.020]  and then they say oh he confessed Walt Walt's you know in the hospital drug it
[02:48:36.020 --> 02:48:40.260]  must be true they can blow something up and grab me and say that I thought that
[02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:43.020]  was deplorable the way those people were treated these guys run out with their
[02:48:43.020 --> 02:48:46.740]  hands over their heads when their box are short so I had to abandon their
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:50.540]  sweet and or salty snacks in front of the TV these guys are pointing machine
[02:48:50.540 --> 02:48:53.780]  guns at him a guy tries to put his hands down another guy yells at him
[02:48:53.780 --> 02:49:00.940]  he's pointing this this M4 at him that makes my blood boil and I'll tell you
[02:49:00.940 --> 02:49:05.100]  something I have been tempted to leave this country and not come back but I'll
[02:49:05.100 --> 02:49:10.180]  tell you what these SOB's aren't gonna make me leave my country I'm staying God
[02:49:10.180 --> 02:49:14.180]  bless you absolutely there's no where to run anyways if it keeps getting worse I
[02:49:14.180 --> 02:49:18.300]  may get my family out of here though Eric Eric in North Carolina you're on the
[02:49:18.300 --> 02:49:23.820]  air welcome hey Alex how's it going buddy good go ahead thanks for holding I
[02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:27.300]  think your guest is right in that this is all gonna start with the money and
[02:49:27.300 --> 02:49:32.100]  that brings me to my next prediction I think the next Federal Reserve chairman
[02:49:32.100 --> 02:49:36.700]  is gonna be an African-American financier by the name of Roger Ferguson
[02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:42.180]  this will be effective because when the Federal Reserve sells all to all of its
[02:49:42.180 --> 02:49:46.620]  treasury bonds and other stuff that it's bought with newly printed money that's
[02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:51.660]  gonna create a mass amount destabilization volatility and it's gonna
[02:49:51.660 --> 02:49:57.660]  be effective to have an African-American financier right there you know as the
[02:49:57.660 --> 02:50:00.380]  Federal Reserve didn't they could say it's racist if you don't like them taking
[02:50:00.380 --> 02:50:05.700]  your bank account exactly it'll keep that bay the angst and the anger that will be
[02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:12.020]  foisted on that institution well he is vice chairman of the board of governors
[02:50:12.020 --> 02:50:16.540]  the Federal Reserve system and is currently the president of the chief
[02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:21.340]  executive of the teachers insurance and annuity association we'll see where did
[02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:25.940]  you get a tip on this or why do you think that it's the media I see the
[02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:30.620]  media grooming him through interviews that I see on CNBC and in the way they
[02:50:30.620 --> 02:50:34.660]  they end their interview with them that the anchors are like oh he didn't say
[02:50:34.660 --> 02:50:38.900]  he wouldn't he didn't say he wouldn't be the Federal Reserve chairman so I see
[02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:43.660]  them pre-programming us and in a way that will expect that he and then the
[02:50:43.660 --> 02:50:48.180]  racists don't like it because they know black guy did it Bernanke was doing a
[02:50:48.180 --> 02:50:53.060]  good job till that black guy got in there it is like the Federal Reserve
[02:50:53.060 --> 02:50:56.660]  running us for a hundred years shedding all this job I think you're probably
[02:50:56.660 --> 02:51:00.740]  right if they're on the news saying he's a good guy I'll tell you I like Ferguson

[02:55:41.180 --> 02:55:44.500]  have next week the big interview with Mike judge where he got political because
[02:55:44.500 --> 02:55:50.460]  the hour is you know running out here the time is short so just a lot of
[02:55:50.460 --> 02:55:53.980]  surprises coming up on the nightly news everywhere else if you're not a prison
[02:55:53.980 --> 02:55:58.740]  planet TV subscriber it's 15 since today and you get 11 memberships a month for
[02:55:58.740 --> 02:56:04.340]  that it's like 55 cents a person per month this is because one membership is
[02:56:04.340 --> 02:56:08.540]  really 11 prison planet TV again I want to thank John B. Wells for spending so
[02:56:08.540 --> 02:56:12.100]  much time with us today let's take another call here fill in Texas who's
[02:56:12.100 --> 02:56:17.740]  been holding on a long March thank you Phil you're on the air welcome hey Alex
[02:56:17.740 --> 02:56:24.700]  and John a huge fan of you guys just wanted to talk about the open carry
[02:56:24.700 --> 02:56:31.700]  March on July 4th I just I'm really concerned about it just because so much
[02:56:31.700 --> 02:56:36.620]  on the line and I feel like it's maybe not being gone about in the best way
[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:42.060]  just because at this point you kind of have to expect the provocateur or the
[02:56:42.060 --> 02:56:46.700]  palm or you know I mean just and well here's the deal I've never done an arm
[02:56:46.700 --> 02:56:50.500]  March on Washington but the Supreme Court ruled five years ago that it's
[02:56:50.500 --> 02:56:53.700]  unconstitutional for them to prohibit the Second Amendment there but they're
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:57:00.780]  still doing it so I admire Adam Kukesh for his courage I have said that I
[02:57:00.780 --> 02:57:04.500]  would just have a camera if I was there but then yeah he's like well thank you
[02:57:04.500 --> 02:57:08.620]  for endorsing it no that's not what I'm doing I'm not endorsing it and I hear
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:12.100]  what you're saying but I'm not gonna demonizing and sit there and snipe is
[02:57:12.100 --> 02:57:16.620]  my point and we can't you know well we better not go out and protest they might
[02:57:16.620 --> 02:57:21.900]  provocateur us there you know a right not exercise is a right that's lost so I
[02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:29.380]  have mixed feelings about it John B. Wells what do you think what I think is
[02:57:29.380 --> 02:57:36.460]  this I don't know I don't know how to answer that one I don't understand the
[02:57:36.460 --> 02:57:42.580]  all of these contradictions it's a this has taken a long time to get to this
[02:57:42.580 --> 02:57:48.780]  point let me just submit this to you Alex and to the listeners I'm just this
[02:57:48.780 --> 02:57:53.140]  is a short paragraph the worth of a people the character character of its
[02:57:53.140 --> 02:57:57.700]  internal organization which through this worth of a people may produce its
[02:57:57.700 --> 02:58:02.980]  effect and the character of a people's education these are the starting points
[02:58:02.980 --> 02:58:07.420]  for political action these are the foundations for the success of that
[02:58:07.420 --> 02:58:12.060]  action when you consider we were just talking earlier about how fast the time
[02:58:12.060 --> 02:58:18.540]  is going by and how it seems like two weeks ago we were in our teens the game
[02:58:18.540 --> 02:58:25.500]  is is well underway and we're way behind now the people who are in power now do
[02:58:25.500 --> 02:58:30.140]  not care about the Constitution they they they violate it whenever it suits
[02:58:30.140 --> 02:58:33.020]  them and then when they're called to account they say they don't know and
[02:58:33.020 --> 02:58:36.380]  laying down to them only encourages them stay there I want you to be able to
[02:58:36.380 --> 02:58:43.300]  finish this point and let you get out of here caller stay there thank you for

[03:00:27.220 --> 03:00:35.260]  get to some calls here it's just time runs out so quickly yeah I see one of
[03:00:35.260 --> 03:00:38.180]  the callers wants to talk about solutions the solution to stop complying
[03:00:38.180 --> 03:00:42.500]  with tyranny enforce against it get angry at it cops walk over and say you
[03:00:42.500 --> 03:00:47.260]  can't film in public say it's America first amendment you film us stop acting
[03:00:47.260 --> 03:00:50.020]  like slaves or you'll become them but but you were getting the point about
[03:00:50.020 --> 03:00:53.460]  that quote in the break cut you off about the Constitution and the
[03:00:53.460 --> 03:00:59.740]  establishment doesn't care about our Constitution John B. Wells yes that quote
[03:00:59.740 --> 03:01:03.460]  that I read is from the book my new order that was Adolf Hitler talking and
[03:01:03.460 --> 03:01:10.740]  so I would say that and just connecting the dots here women get your men by
[03:01:10.740 --> 03:01:15.940]  their earlobes and gently tug them go to the PTA meeting sit down and read the
[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:20.820]  books that your children are being issued in their schools it took a long
[03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:24.300]  time for Hitler to rise to power and the reason I've come back and come back
[03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:29.060]  and come back to Adolf Hitler is because he had one amazing juggernaut of a
[03:01:29.060 --> 03:01:34.900]  machine working for him and what was behind it money you see Tyson crup
[03:01:34.900 --> 03:01:39.860]  elevators that's Fritz Tyson's company the billionaire who bankrolled Hitler
[03:01:39.860 --> 03:01:46.460]  that's crup the cannon maker you see AEG Siemens Merck these are all Nazi
[03:01:46.460 --> 03:01:51.100]  air companies and I'll also tell you as you know Alex and thanks to you many of
[03:01:51.100 --> 03:01:55.940]  your listeners know it IBM did business with the Nazi the entire duration of the
[03:01:55.940 --> 03:01:59.420]  war turns out he was basically their creation you know and again that's a
[03:01:59.420 --> 03:02:05.700]  shadow of what they think of you Bayer same thing shipping out HIV AIDS blood
[03:02:05.700 --> 03:02:11.180]  they they know what they're doing ladies and gentlemen and they are cold
[03:02:11.180 --> 03:02:15.980]  blooded that's what unites them and it's unbelievable here's a quote I have
[03:02:15.980 --> 03:02:20.020]  partially gave yesterday it was the best of times it was the worst of times it
[03:02:20.020 --> 03:02:24.860]  was the age of wisdom it was the age of foolishness it was the epoch of belief it
[03:02:24.860 --> 03:02:28.820]  was the epoch of incredulity it was the season of light it was the season of
[03:02:28.820 --> 03:02:32.420]  darkness it was the spring of hope it was the winter of despair we had
[03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:36.020]  everything before us we had nothing before us we were all going direct to
[03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:41.900]  heaven we were all going direct the other way in short the period was so far
[03:02:41.900 --> 03:02:47.100]  like the present period that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on being
[03:02:47.100 --> 03:02:53.580]  received for good or evil in the superlative degree of comparison only
[03:02:53.580 --> 03:02:58.660]  let's jam in one final call because I want to hear this we got Morrissey I
[03:02:58.660 --> 03:03:03.820]  think is what that says I want to talk about predictions go ahead Maurice go
