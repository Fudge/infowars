[00:00.000 --> 00:12.480]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[00:12.480 --> 00:20.120]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[00:20.120 --> 00:29.920]  Alex Jones
[00:29.920 --> 00:37.360]  it's January 30th on this Wednesday edition 2013 we're gonna be live here
[00:37.360 --> 00:42.120]  for the next three hours and we had him on last week and the hour went by very
[00:42.120 --> 00:46.480]  quickly so I wanted to get him on for an hour today so you could question him Jim
[00:46.480 --> 00:52.560]  Garo was talking about a quote retired military living legend saying that the
[00:52.560 --> 00:56.260]  military brass that he knows has told them they're having a litmus test will
[00:56.260 --> 00:59.840]  you fire on US citizens well the military's training for that and that's
[00:59.840 --> 01:04.920]  in the news and General Boykin the former head of Special Forces he's been
[01:04.920 --> 01:10.240]  talking about plans for a police state he's been talking about our government
[01:10.240 --> 01:16.360]  giving al-qaeda terrorist weapons gee I wonder what general mr. Garo is talking
[01:16.360 --> 01:20.800]  about but he has more to say today and he said the general not that we know
[01:20.800 --> 01:29.060]  it's Boykin did not want to go public himself but wanted to go through Jim
[01:29.060 --> 01:33.480]  Garo and I looked up Jim Garo he runs heavily in the big Christian circles as
[01:33.480 --> 01:37.120]  general Boykin does the same circles but he will not reveal the source I'm smart
[01:37.120 --> 01:39.880]  enough to know who it is and again people said well why are you revealing
[01:39.880 --> 01:44.560]  it then you know 99% chance because the NSA and the government already knows I

[08:13.440 --> 08:31.800]  we are living on the edge of a designed controlled implosion they open three new
[08:31.800 --> 08:40.360]  coal-powered plants a week in Communist China we are not allowed to open one new
[08:40.360 --> 08:45.800]  one a year in fact just this week multiple coal-powered plants we covered
[08:45.800 --> 08:50.760]  this on Monday were shut down more modern plants that are extremely clean
[08:50.760 --> 08:57.440]  and a new one that had been built over the last five years has officially been
[08:57.440 --> 09:01.920]  told they're not allowed to open on the Texas coast that was to supply Houston
[09:01.920 --> 09:08.920]  Corpus Christi and surrounding areas we now have to buy our power from Mexico
[09:08.920 --> 09:14.480]  that's on record who have completely dirty coal-burning plants but again
[09:14.480 --> 09:18.280]  they're globalist owned you see everything is about shutting us down
[09:18.280 --> 09:23.720]  with taxes and regulations and red tape so you can only operate in India and
[09:23.720 --> 09:30.920]  China and Mexico and it doesn't build up those people it actually lowers their
[09:30.920 --> 09:36.160]  standard of living on average as well don't look at it
[09:36.160 --> 09:39.920]  China has a lower standard of living Mexico has a lower standard of living
[09:39.920 --> 09:45.880]  India has a lower standard of living for the general population and they try to
[09:45.880 --> 09:52.480]  cook those numbers but it's clear that's why just in 2011 something like 48,000
[09:52.480 --> 09:57.400]  farmers committed suicide in India and it was some huge number last year as
[09:57.400 --> 10:01.880]  well the official tallies aren't out yet statistics always come out six months to
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.320]  a year later Mexico don't have to tell you about Mexico its economy just the
[10:06.320 --> 10:11.880]  worst it's ever been close to 60,000 deaths the last five years this is the
[10:11.880 --> 10:18.920]  incredible situation that the world is facing and the global ish use poverty as
[10:18.920 --> 10:24.640]  a control mechanism let me just go over some of the headlines that we're going

[10:42.640 --> 10:48.600]  covering we've got more military and police drills terrorizing people first
[10:48.600 --> 10:54.080]  it was Miami and then Houston with the army and now it's going on in Chicago

[11:11.880 --> 11:17.520]  in chaos and bloodshed that's the plan who runs the world solid proof a core
[11:17.520 --> 11:21.240]  group of wealthy elitist is pulling the strings I want to go over that article
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.640]  later it's pretty powerful now you know you're no longer living in a free
[11:25.640 --> 11:28.880]  country when I've got to get to that article because it just goes through is
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.040]  just just the latest amazing trampling of Liberty
[11:33.040 --> 11:38.320]  fluoridation ends in another major city after 51 years so some good news on that
[11:38.320 --> 11:47.480]  front msnbc's Finney rips crazy crackers on the right for very hateful language
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.040]  and again this is all about the so-called left who are really nothing
[11:52.040 --> 11:59.120]  more than authoritarians absolutely going crazy and getting in everyone's
[11:59.120 --> 12:03.760]  face and saying you're a racist you're bad if you don't accept higher taxes if
[12:03.760 --> 12:08.280]  you don't turn your guns in if you don't take force inoculations they now call
[12:08.280 --> 12:19.800]  racist for everything or everything and again it's a gang mentality and it's not
[12:19.800 --> 12:24.680]  even so-called minorities who are really the majority in this country now who are
[12:24.680 --> 12:29.760]  the ones pushing it it is the social engineers who want to divide Americans
[12:29.760 --> 12:33.760]  against each other I mean I see Obama supporters walking around I talked to
[12:33.760 --> 12:38.360]  them as I see their their button pins or their bumper stickers I talked to some
[12:38.360 --> 12:42.400]  yesterday in a parking lot I was with my son and I said hey I see you have an
[12:42.400 --> 12:46.120]  Obama sticker and they looked at me with a please look smiling the lady went
[12:46.120 --> 12:52.720]  Alex Jones I went so you you feel like you're winning right now because you of
[12:52.720 --> 12:57.760]  Obama she goes well he's better than Romney it was a older Hispanic lady with
[12:57.760 --> 13:01.880]  her husband and I said really I mean he raised your payroll taxes he lied about
[13:01.880 --> 13:07.240]  and he and he's very deceptive she's like ah whatever you're just mad you
[13:07.240 --> 13:12.280]  lost and it's always the same thing it's like feeling like hey I won you know my
[13:12.280 --> 13:18.040]  football team won or my guy won while he is a total globalist let me explain this
[13:18.040 --> 13:22.480]  people they shut down over 200 power plants in the first four years of his
[13:22.480 --> 13:28.440]  administration they're set to quote shut down massive numbers more some estimates
[13:28.440 --> 13:34.760]  over a thousand that's about half of what we've got left now if you think the
[13:34.760 --> 13:40.160]  economy is bad now and the GDP shrinking now folks you ain't seen nothing yet and
[13:40.160 --> 13:45.120]  and let me tell you the social engineers it's all in agenda 21 it's all in the
[13:45.120 --> 13:54.480]  big sociology papers that we covered you know last week with dr. Corsi in studio
[13:54.480 --> 14:00.200]  there it is industry group 204 coal power plants to be closed in next five
[14:00.200 --> 14:06.960]  years and what is that out of because that's a that's the environmental leader
[14:06.960 --> 14:11.800]  and when did they come out with that report well that's September 20th 2012
[14:11.800 --> 14:16.400]  they've already closed 200 plants what are they talking about I guess that's
[14:16.400 --> 14:19.560]  just their their estimate on on what what more is going to be closed
[14:19.560 --> 14:22.800]  regardless they've already shut down 200 they say they're shutting down 200 more
[14:22.800 --> 14:26.080]  estimates I see as many as a thousand because see they say oh you can stay
[14:26.080 --> 14:30.240]  open just do these things but then that bankrupts you which you've all seen the
[14:30.240 --> 14:34.560]  clip or maybe you haven't in fact we're gonna play later the clip of the racist
[14:34.560 --> 14:38.280]  stuff first but can you guys just pull up on YouTube the Obama we're gonna
[14:38.280 --> 14:42.000]  bankrupt coal clip from five years ago thanks I don't want to just I'm getting
[14:42.000 --> 14:46.040]  neurotic about I don't want to just say that and listeners go oh yeah right I
[14:46.040 --> 14:49.720]  want to I want you to hear Obama saying you can have a coal-powered plant we're
[14:49.720 --> 14:52.880]  gonna bankrupt you you know we've got enough clean burning coal that means
[14:52.880 --> 14:56.560]  it's absolutely clean without even having all the expensive scrubbers to
[14:56.560 --> 15:00.160]  run this country for over a hundred years and the studies they did in 1997
[15:00.160 --> 15:04.760]  when Clinton laid off millions of acres in southern Utah and into one other
[15:04.760 --> 15:10.160]  state of the only clean burning coal in the world other than a field in Mongolia
[15:10.160 --> 15:13.680]  China that the Chinese developed and guess what the company that was given
[15:13.680 --> 15:16.760]  the state rights to that a year before guess what happened to their stock in
[15:16.760 --> 15:21.080]  the week after Clinton signed an executive order in 97 knocking it off
[15:21.080 --> 15:29.640]  limits their stock doubled their stock doubled you see the real way the
[15:29.640 --> 15:36.200]  globalist make money is they just shut down hundreds of plants not owned by
[15:36.320 --> 15:40.880]  globalist and then that makes their profits go up because you've got to buy
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.000]  it from them and they can gouge you I mean this is so elementary put rules on
[15:45.000 --> 15:48.560]  where nobody can have a factory here in the u.s. it moves to China only globalist
[15:48.560 --> 15:51.800]  insiders who made the deals when they put Mao into power and then officially
[15:51.800 --> 15:56.800]  made the deal in 75 when Nixon went there 76 sent his minions earlier than
[15:56.800 --> 15:58.920]  that
[16:00.360 --> 16:05.160]  I guess Nixon went like 72 my point is is that even after that happened the
[16:05.160 --> 16:10.280]  issue is ladies and gentlemen is that this is a full takeover and then they
[16:10.280 --> 16:15.720]  can go and operate and and it's total and whenever Bush was in Republicans
[16:15.720 --> 16:18.160]  were like I don't care if he tortures I don't care if there's secret arrest I
[16:18.160 --> 16:21.640]  don't care what they do I'm feeling good my guys in and I'm like don't you
[16:21.640 --> 16:25.400]  understand he's a globalist they had that same look of satisfaction shut up
[16:25.400 --> 16:30.240]  liberal I'm like no no no he's a puppet it's an agenda we've got to get and now
[16:30.240 --> 16:34.840]  the left is is I've got to say probably three times worse I mean they do not
[16:34.840 --> 16:40.200]  care what Obama does they can he can raise their taxes he can go back on
[16:40.200 --> 16:44.160]  promises and go after their guns he can do all of that and they don't care
[16:44.160 --> 16:50.400]  because he's their guy and their winners through him reflected glory and it's the
[16:50.400 --> 16:59.160]  creed of slaves it really gets to me we have the Obama cold video here he is in
[16:59.160 --> 17:04.800]  2008 on television here it is so if somebody wants to build a coal-powered
[17:04.800 --> 17:09.440]  plant they can it's just that it will bankrupt them because they're gonna be
[17:09.440 --> 17:16.160]  charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted so
[17:16.160 --> 17:18.640]  there you go
[17:18.640 --> 17:22.080]  and so yeah they've shut 200 and something down they say they're gonna
[17:22.080 --> 17:26.560]  shut down 200 more few months ago the numbers I've got is by some industry
[17:26.560 --> 17:30.720]  analysts it's over a thousand because you won't be able to operate
[17:31.720 --> 17:38.160]  and people like good I don't want those rich guys make money off coal folks and
[17:38.160 --> 17:41.120]  then when I talk about this oh you must own coal stock or be with the coal
[17:41.120 --> 17:45.520]  industry I've never gotten one red cent from anybody involved in any
[17:45.520 --> 17:52.520]  petrochemicals coal distillates anything zero let me tell you though Austin is

[24:37.040 --> 24:41.000]  again if you're a new listener and you're like man this guy is like super
[24:41.000 --> 24:46.360]  ultra negative if you go into the doctor and they say you've got a compound
[24:46.360 --> 24:50.080]  fracture your bones sticking out of your leg we've got to do a surgery and fix
[24:50.080 --> 24:54.820]  that it's not negative you're you're you're at the hospital you're getting
[24:54.820 --> 25:00.440]  aid and the politicians are like we're gonna get you more welfare we're gonna
[25:00.440 --> 25:07.120]  get you more food stamps and their own official policies that we've covered at
[25:07.120 --> 25:12.400]  nauseum are to de-industrialize us under the treaty that we're signed on to
[25:12.400 --> 25:21.840]  agenda 21 and the cover is it's for the environment
[25:21.840 --> 25:26.600]  and it's so criminal that my own City Council is the model of this number four
[25:26.600 --> 25:29.640]  years ago they are three and a half years ago they couldn't get the carbon
[25:29.640 --> 25:33.600]  taxes ran through officially at the Copenhagen Denmark UN meeting because
[25:33.600 --> 25:37.640]  all those documents were coming out how they were really planning to destroy
[25:37.640 --> 25:43.280]  economies and carry out eugenics and how the third world had to have right at
[25:43.280 --> 25:47.360]  double the cuts even the West did and now it was a death sentence not just a
[25:47.360 --> 25:51.000]  death sentence for the economy death sentence for people and Schwarzenegger
[25:51.000 --> 25:55.920]  said I will lead you can pull this up I will lead the move and a UN plan to
[25:55.920 --> 26:01.120]  take over the cities and the states if the nation states will not do it they
[26:01.120 --> 26:05.400]  were already doing that program it's called UN muneal ization standardized
[26:05.400 --> 26:10.400]  tied to federal HUD funds in our country similar funds in Europe and other areas
[26:10.400 --> 26:15.160]  and they come in with hey here's a 50 million dollars for your little town if
[26:15.160 --> 26:19.160]  you agree to pass ordinances that all these people can't build on their
[26:19.160 --> 26:22.760]  property you can only build on this property and then the maps are drawn
[26:22.760 --> 26:27.080]  with a local boss all good old boys so they get to keep their land and the
[26:27.080 --> 26:32.000]  globalists get to come in and do deals with them I mean it's very simple you
[26:32.000 --> 26:36.320]  shut off power plants your power plants make more money
[26:36.320 --> 26:40.760]  you shut off industry but only your industry gets to operate now you've got
[26:40.760 --> 26:45.320]  a monopoly you shut off other people's real estate your real estate increases
[26:45.320 --> 26:49.880]  in price that's how the globalist make their money and their control that's
[26:49.880 --> 26:54.960]  their big secret and so as things shut down they say don't worry we got
[26:54.960 --> 26:59.520]  welfare for you Oh food stamps went from 25 million to almost 50 million now
[26:59.520 --> 27:03.240]  they're going to be a hundred million and it's the same in Europe the same all
[27:03.240 --> 27:07.920]  over the world this is an exact program
[27:09.280 --> 27:14.160]  and we've talked about it forever but people need to understand it's now gonna
[27:14.160 --> 27:18.720]  get very very bad I'm gonna come back and go to your calls in a long segment
[27:18.720 --> 27:22.840]  that's coming up but look at this US economy unexpectedly contracts in fourth
[27:22.840 --> 27:27.800]  quarter I mean give me a break folks they knew that all the things they're
[27:27.800 --> 27:32.560]  doing with contract the economy and wait until all the payroll taxes increasing
[27:32.560 --> 27:38.280]  goes into place wait until all the thousands of major businesses who wrote
[27:38.280 --> 27:44.320]  the health care law lower people down to 25 hours a week
[27:44.320 --> 27:48.720]  instead of 40 so they get out of the Obamacare yeah it'll show an uptick in
[27:48.720 --> 27:52.080]  employment because they're gonna count people working extra jobs as new jobs
[27:52.080 --> 27:57.200]  but you're not gonna have as much money and it doesn't matter though you can
[27:57.200 --> 28:02.200]  just get starry-eyed and go but I got Obama in he loves me he hates the rich
[28:02.200 --> 28:08.200]  people US economy unexpectedly contracts in fourth quarter the average person's
[28:08.200 --> 28:11.000]  getting hundreds of dollars more out of their paycheck every month taking out
[28:11.000 --> 28:15.320]  other paychecks some estimates are as high as $200 for people making like
[28:15.320 --> 28:19.800]  30,000 a year I mean this is just this is the difference between getting enough
[28:19.800 --> 28:24.840]  groceries and then people love their servitude though because they've been
[28:24.840 --> 28:31.440]  dumbed down and it just goes on here it just goes on here with the headlines US
[28:31.440 --> 28:41.360]  debt headed towards 200% of GDP even after fiscal cliff deal think about that
[28:41.360 --> 28:50.680]  think about how think about how crazy that is
[28:50.680 --> 28:58.600]  the debt yearly will be 200% of GDP that means you're making let's say $50,000 a
[28:58.600 --> 29:09.320]  year and your debt is $100,000 are you gonna be in a good position no you're
[29:09.320 --> 29:14.440]  gonna be a debt slave who was put into this position and it makes me so angry
[29:14.440 --> 29:18.800]  to now see our country's credit rating being devalued just like they've done to
[29:18.800 --> 29:22.000]  European nations like Greece and when they're done that's where we're going to
[29:22.000 --> 29:28.000]  be and they'll be up there promising more government more taxes to give to
[29:28.000 --> 29:32.320]  people who had their factories and jobs shipped overseas and their jobs here
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.680]  destroyed with red tape with the streets teeming with paramilitary police
[29:36.680 --> 29:42.040]  checkpoints gun owners are terrorists and the government then hiring not just

[33:56.160 --> 34:03.760]  technotronic age point is is that they planned all this and you got to hand it
[34:03.760 --> 34:09.000]  to them what they envisioned 30 40 50 years ago they did I mean I read stuff
[34:09.000 --> 34:13.880]  Bertrand Russell wrote Nobel Prize winner was it for literature wrote in
[34:13.880 --> 34:17.960]  the 30s and I mean it's what's happening now
[34:17.960 --> 34:27.240]  take Aldous Huxley he wrote in 1932 brave new world and then of course he
[34:27.240 --> 34:32.200]  gave a speech in 61 62 before he died at Berkeley it's online you can go listen
[34:32.200 --> 34:37.240]  to it just type Aldous Huxley's Berkeley speech where he said this book is what I
[34:37.240 --> 34:41.200]  believe would really happen being in the highest levels of scientific
[34:41.200 --> 34:47.360]  intelligentsia growing up in London and of course his brother founded UNESCO at
[34:47.360 --> 34:51.560]  the UN which is the real head of the UN
[34:52.080 --> 34:57.360]  Julian Huxley and I cover it in the endgame it's just this is not my opinion
[34:57.360 --> 35:01.160]  and I go back to this caller who was calling about how they're replacing
[35:01.160 --> 35:05.000]  their Air Force base with drones in Arkansas and he just said yeah they're
[35:05.000 --> 35:09.240]  getting rid of the I guess his army base it was a tens and he just hung up
[35:09.240 --> 35:14.200]  sounding depressed and I realized if you just tune in and you hear all this you
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.360]  need to think it's crazy because it is crazy but it's I'm not the one doing it
[35:18.360 --> 35:24.000]  I know it sounds crazy reality is crazy truth is stranger than fiction has been
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.800]  said a billion times
[35:26.800 --> 35:34.400]  and I don't go over all this just to demoralize people I do it so people know
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.600]  about it so that we're not compartmentalized and so we can see
[35:38.600 --> 35:43.160]  through the wall next to us and then through the next wall and the next wall
[35:43.160 --> 35:45.120]  and realize we're all in this together
[35:45.120 --> 35:49.920]  man I don't care if you're some foolish cop running an illegal checkpoint I pull
[35:49.920 --> 35:52.320]  up to and it's happened
[35:52.320 --> 35:55.320]  I'm not even mad at you anymore
[35:55.320 --> 35:59.920]  I'm mainly frustrated because I know the whole program basically I know how
[35:59.920 --> 36:01.320]  you're programmed
[36:01.320 --> 36:05.280]  I know you're compartmentalized and if I throw a fit and start yelling at you
[36:05.280 --> 36:08.280]  it's because I'm sick of it
[36:08.280 --> 36:11.480]  it'd be like if I was trying to get out of a burning house and I came to the
[36:11.480 --> 36:13.560]  door and you're there going I'm not gonna let you out
[36:13.560 --> 36:18.120]  I'm like do you see the fire and the smoke no I don't conspiracy theorist
[36:20.120 --> 36:24.600]  I'm like listen all oh I just I don't even know what to say anymore
[36:25.200 --> 36:28.600]  they're unplugging our power plants
[36:28.600 --> 36:33.800]  they're shutting our entire industry down that they're writing books and laws
[36:33.800 --> 36:35.520]  and white papers about it
[36:35.520 --> 36:38.520]  they're evil they're evil
[36:38.520 --> 36:41.520]  I want to stop them don't you care
[36:42.760 --> 36:46.120]  people say what do we do and you know I guess that's the point we've reached is
[36:46.120 --> 36:50.080]  there's so many criminals in so many positions of power and then so many yes
[36:50.080 --> 36:53.080]  men and women beneath them
[36:53.080 --> 37:01.400]  and I guess that's why they're so confident to now just be out in the open
[37:01.400 --> 37:03.400]  with so much of this
[37:03.400 --> 37:10.240]  I mean our country they are trying to hold us under the water and then
[37:10.240 --> 37:14.200]  somebody else walks along says hey looks like you're trying to drown that person
[37:14.200 --> 37:17.120]  oh no I'm trying to help get them out of the water sure looks like you're holding
[37:17.120 --> 37:19.120]  their head under
[37:19.120 --> 37:23.240]  and then I walk over and you'll pick up their notebook says here you plan to
[37:23.240 --> 37:25.000]  drown them here today
[37:25.000 --> 37:28.000]  you know you wrote you were going to oh no I'm not doing that you're and they're
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.600]  holding them under
[37:29.600 --> 37:33.880]  ok well I see you later Bob guess I'm have fun what you're doing
[37:35.160 --> 37:38.160]  then later I walk back by there's a dead body floating
[37:38.960 --> 37:43.000]  and I see Bob later he goes oh no he's not dead he's just relaxing
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.480]  he's got gills
[37:45.480 --> 37:48.960]  walk back by two days later there's buzzards over on the side of the water
[37:48.960 --> 37:50.000]  eating the dead body
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  oh no he's not dead he's been liberated
[37:53.000 --> 37:59.240]  I mean you have to be crazy to buy in to what these people are doing and
[38:01.920 --> 38:04.280]  it just blows me away
[38:04.280 --> 38:07.280]  to see them totally dismantling our entire country
[38:10.160 --> 38:14.360]  and they're selling legalizing the illegal aliens as a way to fix the
[38:14.360 --> 38:17.360]  economy
[38:17.360 --> 38:20.880]  and again nothing against the people that are here I know most of these
[38:20.880 --> 38:23.880]  people are hard-working smart folks who come from a great tyranny
[38:25.040 --> 38:28.040]  the problem is when by the time they vote
[38:28.880 --> 38:32.360]  over 90 percent in the polls and studies out there you look it up
[38:32.880 --> 38:37.440]  vote for socialism because they see the government as their friend because it
[38:37.440 --> 38:42.120]  told them they were their friend when they're really brought here to be brought
[38:42.120 --> 38:47.440]  into the system inculcated and to get government services to be new dependents
[38:49.800 --> 38:54.320]  and the illegals becoming citizens on average will vote to take our guns
[38:56.720 --> 39:00.600]  and they will vote to collectivize and they will vote as long as they get a
[39:00.600 --> 39:01.920]  goodie from the government
[39:01.920 --> 39:04.920]  same thing with the domesticated American people
[39:06.040 --> 39:10.280]  and conservatives and libertarians say well things will collapse
[39:10.280 --> 39:16.240]  you're idiots they're not idiots the power structure is set up to consolidate
[39:16.240 --> 39:20.560]  the control as we collapse and look I know I talk about this at nauseum but I
[39:20.560 --> 39:23.320]  will not apologize for it
[39:23.320 --> 39:26.240]  in closing and I'm going to your calls
[39:26.240 --> 39:29.880]  so I'm listening to the show last night about 20 minutes of it or so just
[39:29.880 --> 39:36.160]  dialing in on the iphone app singer of my smartphone laying in bed at 10 at
[39:36.160 --> 39:38.240]  night or whatever it was
[39:38.240 --> 39:41.760]  and I'm listening to the end of the third hour where I'm ranting about the
[39:41.760 --> 39:46.360]  technocracy and I'm angry at myself because there's all these other points I
[39:46.360 --> 39:49.560]  should have made and I could have if I was calm and I'm thinking about it all
[39:49.560 --> 39:54.080]  but then I listen to the old guy calling in from Arkansas at the end of the call
[39:54.080 --> 39:58.560]  signing just bummed out and that's not what I'm trying to do
[39:59.840 --> 40:02.840]  I'm just trying to get you to become aware of what's going on
[40:03.640 --> 40:07.640]  because here's the deal the arcade I'm pro technology
[40:07.640 --> 40:11.920]  the problem is the architecture of the way technology is being rolled out
[40:11.920 --> 40:17.520]  through federal and global regulations in concert with the dozen or so major
[40:17.520 --> 40:25.240]  15 or so major technology companies is to put back door trojan horses in to
[40:25.240 --> 40:28.240]  control and track everything we do
[40:28.240 --> 40:31.160]  outside of law
[40:31.160 --> 40:34.240]  and that's why there's new articles out about all the wireless devices and
[40:34.240 --> 40:38.680]  computers have security flaws back doors no matter what company it is these are
[40:38.680 --> 40:39.560]  built in
[40:39.560 --> 40:44.800]  how that happened they're designed for the NSA for the police for Google to
[40:44.800 --> 40:46.060]  break into your computer
[40:46.060 --> 40:49.040]  Google got caught two years ago driving around with cars all over the world
[40:49.040 --> 40:53.680]  hacking your computers but they weren't hacking them they had the keys
[40:54.400 --> 40:57.400]  they are the NSA
[40:57.400 --> 41:03.720]  and again they're building this whole technocracy to phase out humanity
[41:03.720 --> 41:09.200]  we are obsolete and and and in the words of the global technocrats
[41:09.200 --> 41:12.200]  well I say the tyrants are obsolete
[41:13.480 --> 41:17.640]  and this is a huge power trip for them to be building this huge program to
[41:17.640 --> 41:21.720]  have envisioned this huge program and their their response is you know if
[41:21.720 --> 41:24.920]  you're reading this is in some of their books and white papers
[41:24.920 --> 41:27.240]  you're thinking it's immoral
[41:27.240 --> 41:34.800]  notice that no one's opposing us because they're dumb animals
[41:34.800 --> 41:39.520]  and then they built a system to make people act like dumb animals from birth
[41:39.520 --> 41:42.360]  the television the dumbing down the chemicals
[41:42.360 --> 41:48.000]  it's so diabolical and it's all for full control and to put this into full
[41:48.000 --> 41:48.880]  control
[41:48.880 --> 41:53.480]  I mean again I talk about smart meters 10 years ago more than 10 years ago with
[41:53.480 --> 41:58.120]  with engineers and people and I would have retired engineers on who who were
[41:58.120 --> 42:00.440]  young who had left these companies
[42:00.440 --> 42:04.720]  I mean while you heard the interviews warning about me text Mars
[42:04.720 --> 42:07.600]  who's a engineer
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.160]  Air Force officer scientist your best-selling books ever on robots
[42:13.040 --> 42:17.720]  I guess the technology futurist for the Air Force before I became a space and
[42:17.720 --> 42:23.960]  aeronautics professor at UT I read his book project lucid like in 95 when it
[42:23.960 --> 42:29.080]  came out and it was about the smart meters and microchips and smart dust and
[42:29.080 --> 42:34.480]  RFID and and and and then you know I later people a decade later breaking the
[42:34.480 --> 42:35.240]  news
[42:35.240 --> 42:40.360]  I mean this is all very old stuff and you warn people about this
[42:40.360 --> 42:49.480]  and they go that's never going to happen you know my laptop isn't watching me and
[42:49.480 --> 42:54.320]  I've had family years ago 10 years ago at my house they'd say why is your
[42:54.320 --> 42:57.040]  laptop computer covered
[42:57.040 --> 43:00.040]  why do you have a piece of tape over it into the built-in camera
[43:01.600 --> 43:04.160]  when that when they were first starting to do that I'd say because they watch
[43:04.160 --> 43:04.720]  you
[43:04.720 --> 43:08.760]  oh yeah yeah they watch me now it's just all admitted you know it's public see
[43:08.760 --> 43:12.240]  see how far we've come and I know I'm ranting I'll go to your calls
[43:12.240 --> 43:16.880]  it's just that all this evil is already there
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.320]  and denying it only gives it power and now that you're not in denial I don't
[43:25.320 --> 43:26.800]  want you to get scared
[43:26.800 --> 43:30.560]  I want you to get aggressive because we can educate people there can be a huge
[43:30.560 --> 43:33.560]  turning against this a flipping
[43:33.560 --> 43:38.000]  and it's starting to happen and people can just refuse this you know women are
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.600]  standing up the smart meters because at an instinctive level they know it's
[43:42.600 --> 43:48.080]  dangerous and bad and they know that all the new appliances dial into it and
[43:48.080 --> 43:51.120]  they're wondering why every new appliance they buy has smart meter
[43:51.120 --> 43:57.160]  wireless pickups in it and your TV does and your computer does and they admit
[43:57.160 --> 44:00.320]  they're using it to track everything you do and even controlling your thermostat
[44:00.320 --> 44:04.960]  and they're doing test women are sitting there in their houses watching the
[44:04.960 --> 44:08.920]  thermostat change they call the power company and they go we're just doing
[44:08.920 --> 44:13.040]  some tests but you gotta some tests to see if you go along with it
[44:13.040 --> 44:17.240]  I mean it's so diabolical the government's watching you
[44:17.240 --> 44:21.040]  they're molesting you at the airport they're controlling your your
[44:21.040 --> 44:24.040]  thermostat
[44:24.040 --> 44:27.040]  and folks this is just the beginning
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.200]  show again the people at the other end of these computers are very bad
[44:33.200 --> 44:40.680]  and their plan is to build an electronic present around you for your orderly
[44:40.680 --> 44:45.160]  death and I know that sounds incredible but it's on record that they plan to do
[44:45.160 --> 44:50.360]  this and I'm begging all of you to realize none of you are safe they're
[44:50.360 --> 44:51.800]  already attacking you all
[44:51.800 --> 44:55.880]  they're spraying stuff it's in the food it's in the water everybody's sick even
[44:55.880 --> 44:57.880]  when they're taking vitamins and minerals to fight it
[44:57.880 --> 45:01.200]  people like that are doing okay those that aren't are walking dead
[45:01.200 --> 45:04.200]  the cancer rates are exploding this is real
[45:10.880 --> 45:15.280]  let's go ahead and talk to DC in Ohio DC you're on the air
[45:16.560 --> 45:19.560]  hey Alex how you doing today I'm doing all right brother
[45:20.400 --> 45:24.320]  all right hey first-time caller and a first-time listener of the show
[45:25.000 --> 45:31.040]  I'm an ex-navy during the first Gulf War when Papa Bush was even talking about
[45:31.040 --> 45:33.160]  the New World Order at that time
[45:33.160 --> 45:37.440]  I'm an ex-mortgage broker when the government was giving away loans to
[45:37.440 --> 45:42.880]  everybody with bad credit so we all get in houses before the stock market crashed
[45:42.880 --> 45:46.400]  and now a father of three
[45:46.400 --> 45:49.400]  I'm a byproduct of the economic disaster of the middle class
[45:50.240 --> 45:54.160]  I can't if I'm on food stamps I can't afford gas had to take public
[45:54.160 --> 45:59.680]  transportation and now I'm just super concerned about everything that's going
[45:59.680 --> 46:04.880]  on with the billions of dollars taken out of the Federal Reserve the army
[46:04.880 --> 46:11.960]  tactics that are going on in Miami and in Houston and and it's got to stop we
[46:11.960 --> 46:13.120]  gotta fight the fight
[46:13.120 --> 46:16.540]  well I mean I just want all the bureaucrats everybody else to know I
[46:16.540 --> 46:19.540]  mean they're all on a power trip just like the Obama supporters
[46:20.040 --> 46:25.200]  it's so infantile it's like when you're three years old and you know you you
[46:25.200 --> 46:28.680]  feel secure around your dad and your dad's talking to the neighbor and you're
[46:28.680 --> 46:32.040]  standing there by your dad's leg and you you look over and lean your cheek up
[46:32.040 --> 46:36.240]  against your dad and just oh my daddy's so tough my daddy's so strong
[46:36.240 --> 46:40.640]  everybody who's had a father remembers that feeling that's the same feeling
[46:40.640 --> 46:45.840]  government lovers get is they just look at you with this satisfied look
[46:45.840 --> 46:48.960]  I see it in the cops beating up people with video cameras on the street or
[46:48.960 --> 46:52.200]  going in people's houses without warrants the cops just have this
[46:52.200 --> 46:53.960]  satisfied look
[46:53.960 --> 46:58.560]  there's nothing you're gonna do I'm back and you know I got the people back at
[46:58.560 --> 47:02.160]  the headquarters back in me and it's a satisfaction well I want you to know
[47:02.160 --> 47:02.880]  something
[47:02.880 --> 47:07.020]  the people running this are killing you and your family you dumb government
[47:07.020 --> 47:09.840]  bureaucrats you're walking dead
[47:09.840 --> 47:13.440]  they're eugenicist they're killing you I'm sorry go ahead
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.480]  oh no I was going to say I've been pulled over so many times in the last
[47:17.480 --> 47:21.400]  two years because of the scanners that they put on the police vehicles the
[47:21.400 --> 47:25.200]  senior they could stand hundreds of license plates as they go down the
[47:25.200 --> 47:29.240]  street and then anybody who has a warrant they pull over or anybody who
[47:29.240 --> 47:34.880]  has priors they pull over you know ask you to a breathalyzer for for what you
[47:34.880 --> 47:38.040]  know and again and again they act like it's not there when I pulled through the
[47:38.040 --> 47:43.600]  border patrol checkpoint at alpine I went down to I'm gonna play this today
[47:43.600 --> 47:45.840]  we've had it ready for a week but I've been so busy
[47:45.840 --> 47:50.840]  I'll either air it today or or on the nightly news tonight but but the point
[47:50.840 --> 47:54.160]  is I pulled the board patrol checkpoint they obviously know who I am they're all
[47:54.160 --> 47:58.600]  looking I've been through there before other checkpoints and they're all about
[47:58.600 --> 48:04.240]  to pull me over to the secondary search area where I always refuse and he goes
[48:04.240 --> 48:07.120]  why are you videotaping me and I said you're videotaping me and they're like
[48:07.120 --> 48:11.200]  no we're not and I'm like really what are all these video cameras and the guy
[48:11.200 --> 48:16.520]  smiles it's like a mind game and and and yeah they've got these these these
[48:16.520 --> 48:21.040]  robot cameras scanning us but you listen you know the secret of Patriots now
[48:21.040 --> 48:25.840]  Patriots are now going to Mexico or buying Mexican cars with Mexican plates
[48:25.840 --> 48:31.360]  I'm thinking about doing it I'm gonna be honest and you become God they don't

[51:04.360 --> 51:08.680]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[51:08.680 --> 51:13.060]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energy czar wants to control how
[51:13.060 --> 51:17.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[51:17.320 --> 51:21.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[51:21.680 --> 51:25.720]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[51:25.720 --> 51:30.280]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[51:30.280 --> 51:34.480]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[51:34.480 --> 51:38.120]  families lose their power from weather related on edges number five a solar
[51:38.120 --> 51:42.240]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I

[53:09.160 --> 53:13.480]  at your house while you're away plugs into any wall outlet is recommended by
[53:13.480 --> 53:19.800]  many police departments and sells for less than $35 yes it's fake TV this year
[53:19.800 --> 53:23.960]  about one in every 50 u.s. homes will have a break-in with burglars usually
[53:23.960 --> 53:28.840]  picking the easy target a dark house that looks like no one is home fake TV
[53:28.840 --> 53:32.760]  is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home
[53:32.760 --> 53:37.560]  watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV it's like a lamp on a timer
[53:37.560 --> 53:42.640]  but far more convincing and for only $34.95 fake TV could be the difference
[53:42.640 --> 53:47.280]  between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked go to fake TV

[54:01.760 --> 54:29.440]  I hurt myself today to see if I still feel I focus on the pain
[54:29.440 --> 54:42.520]  the only thing that's real the needle tears the whole the old by the way if
[54:42.520 --> 54:46.760]  you're not from Texas or a southwestern state we're not joking we're just
[54:46.760 --> 54:51.080]  talking the illegals can drive without catalytic converters no inspections no
[54:51.080 --> 54:56.160]  insurance no registration and are just left alone and I think that's good I
[54:56.160 --> 55:00.320]  mean I I think citizens should have the book thrown at them and be stomped into
[55:00.320 --> 55:03.440]  the ground I support the New World Order I think it's good they're shutting down
[55:03.440 --> 55:08.600]  our power plants our GDP is contracting we're about to have double of the
[55:08.600 --> 55:14.280]  deficit every year than money we even bring in hey what happened in Greece is
[55:14.280 --> 55:17.400]  a great thing we're going there government loves us I think it's great
[55:17.400 --> 55:22.080]  Obama raised taxes on poorest Americans and their payroll taxes and I think it's
[55:22.080 --> 55:25.920]  good everybody's gonna get cut basically part-time now because he loves you in
[55:25.920 --> 55:30.120]  the government cares about you so let's turn our guns in and trust them don't be
[55:30.120 --> 55:35.200]  an extremist Thomas you're on the air you say you support Obama or did support
[55:35.200 --> 55:43.440]  them you're a wlu v 1520 listener they're in Chicago go ahead Thomas good
[55:43.440 --> 55:47.040]  morning Alex how's it going sir I'm pretty good I just realized I'm about to
[55:47.040 --> 55:51.760]  become above the law I'm about to anyway sorry go ahead no no no problem I
[55:51.760 --> 55:54.920]  definitely would listen to the one gun dollar so you know I think that'd be a
[55:54.920 --> 55:59.520]  god-level radio show where we bow kind of like a Muslim out towards Mecca we
[55:59.520 --> 56:04.120]  bow towards the radio we'd all be immune from all via all the speed traps and
[56:04.120 --> 56:07.920]  traffic tickets and parking tickets yeah see we have a big ol fiesta why not
[56:07.920 --> 56:12.400]  while I'm gonna go hey I think all Americans can do it that's the answer of
[56:12.400 --> 56:16.640]  course I can't go to Mexico and be above the law or go there and have my kids
[56:16.640 --> 56:22.320]  paid for with free free you know birth and stuff but but that's okay but but
[56:22.320 --> 56:28.240]  would Mexico accept me though if I had fake ID to Mexico has consul matricula
[56:28.240 --> 56:32.880]  Center set up to give fake IDs out would they accept my fake ID I don't think I
[56:32.880 --> 56:38.120]  think they put me in a dirt-bottom jail but well that's not fair why can't I get
[56:38.120 --> 56:45.040]  everything free down there well Alex the reason why I'm calling because I was a
[56:45.040 --> 56:50.440]  former Obama supporter I even went to the inauguration 2008 now and now that
[56:50.440 --> 56:54.680]  I look back at it was just years of disdain with President Bush and I didn't
[56:54.680 --> 56:58.880]  know too much about the left-right paradigm at that point so kind of like
[56:58.880 --> 57:03.560]  Chicago Bears versus Green Bay Packers I root for one team my children or my
[57:03.560 --> 57:07.440]  teeth down and you know I can admit that to myself as a man that I got caught up
[57:07.440 --> 57:12.680]  right in that trip now when you when you start to feel really be uh the onion
[57:12.680 --> 57:16.280]  skin you start to get dig a little deeper you realize Democrat Republican
[57:16.280 --> 57:20.120]  two sides of the same coin the good Jordan Maxwell quote and you know I was
[57:20.120 --> 57:23.680]  doing a lot of awakening in the last six years with mostly with your help and
[57:23.680 --> 57:27.880]  then you can't do it on your own the person might be individual like myself
[57:27.880 --> 57:31.800]  needs to go reach for themselves do the research on their own and that's when
[57:31.800 --> 57:34.680]  you truly start to become awakened because you feel like you're doing it
[57:34.680 --> 57:38.200]  on your own you know just listen to what someone's dictating to that's when the
[57:38.200 --> 57:42.520]  stuff really starts to open up and again we will say well are you saying vote for
[57:42.520 --> 57:46.880]  Romney no no it's to realize it's all fixed at that level and then it's the
[57:46.880 --> 57:51.280]  same globalist it's just the understanding that it's a scam and they
[57:51.280 --> 57:54.040]  know where people are gonna wake up to that so they want to get everybody
[57:54.040 --> 57:58.360]  dependent so even though you wake up you're still dependent on them so they
[57:58.360 --> 58:03.000]  can run your life correct that's absolutely correct and like the
[58:03.000 --> 58:07.080]  Democratic Party's like the biggest Ponzi's political Ponzi scheme because
[58:07.080 --> 58:10.160]  you got all these 18 19 year olds coming out of high school they want you know
[58:10.160 --> 58:14.520]  do-gooders just like I was a blue blood a blue-blooded liberal and then by time
[58:14.520 --> 58:17.640]  you hit your 30s you figure it all out they don't need you anymore they got a
[58:17.640 --> 58:21.840]  million more 18 year olds the big Democratic Ponzi scheme and I just want
[58:21.840 --> 58:25.560]  to say to all the people that are smugging it up all you fake liberals out
[58:25.560 --> 58:28.920]  there hugging each other the Beyonce's all the celebrities of the world up
[58:28.920 --> 58:33.080]  there yucking it up with Obama you make me sick because there's nothing liberal
[58:33.080 --> 58:38.040]  about you you're just control freaks fascist pigs and liberal closing that's

[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.400]  have questions for Jim Garrow who has that high-level military contact I quote
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.360]  living legend from the military who says the military is training to confiscate
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.640]  our firearms I mean that's the litmus test will you fire on Americans well
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:08.280]  that's publicly in the training stuff now so but the fact that he's a
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:11.920]  respectable guy and this individual wanted to conduit this info through him
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.080]  he has some more info for us today as well and China in the New World Order

[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:24.280]  air thanks for holding and I welcome
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:31.800]  with you since July of 2002 and I commend you for your great work sir you
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.040]  better people just joined us I'm now Juan Gonzalez so I can be exempt from all
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:39.480]  the taxes and regulations and drive and not be pulled over for no reason like a
[01:01:39.480 --> 01:01:46.840]  US citizen four years away from the next inauguration of another selected
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:51.480]  president of the United States but I think there's no time better than now to
[01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:56.840]  call for a Patriot plan for presidential election reform I think you know we need
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.520]  a comprehensive and look at the way elections are financed the whole primary
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:05.560]  system and you've spoken to a lot of people over the years you probably have
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.800]  a lot more ideas than I do you know what's your what's your take on it can
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:14.040]  push off first off people need to have an awakening and realize whoever the
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:18.840]  system pushes in the primaries from both big parties Republican and Democrat is
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:22.320]  going to be a globalist when Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan were the biggest
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:26.480]  contributors to both guys and most of Obama's policies were actually written
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.880]  up by by Mitt Romney I mean giving a break Mitt Romney said some good things
[01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:37.120]  but he was a globalist pawn and so we had to realize that we get 60% turnouts
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:41.600]  for national elections on average about 8% local locals where you can still get
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:47.040]  in and kind of block the federal system and do some good things we need to get
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:51.520]  foreign money out of politics the globalist only want to pass campaign
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:56.440]  finance to restrict the small individual on powering offshore globalist and we
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:03:00.720]  need to get integrity in the vote again most of the country has fraudulent
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:04.800]  electronic voting machines in place now and there's a lot of evidence I've had
[01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:10.040]  top election fraud people on like Bev Harris clearly the fraud was against
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:16.320]  Perry I mean I mean was against having one of those mental Romney Mitt Romney
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.000]  I was thinking about Perry because he's saying let's give people back their
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:23.840]  unspent tax money which is another fraud I'm gonna talk about later but all of
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:29.080]  that is going on and really it's just realizing this system's bad news but but
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.720]  but it's also hey don't shut down our power plants while China gets to have
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.920]  three new ones a week hey don't let illegal aliens be above the law hey you
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:45.680]  just point out the corruption and and say no to it and get good sheriff's
[01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:50.080]  elected that won't enforce unconstitutional laws I mean I mean it's
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.200]  a cornucopia of things but the biggest thing is recognizing fundamentally this
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:04:00.960]  country's been usurped and taken over by foreign corporate interest in the spirit
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:05.760]  of 1776 then Alex I would like to see you guys you know all the people all you

[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.960]  Alex Jones
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:33.600]  well since he first joined us last week dr. James Garrow PhD his information has
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:38.400]  gone viral just millions of views on YouTube of our interview and Gary
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:41.840]  Francis interview with him on his news program so the good news is this
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:47.080]  information is getting out to people so I wanted to getting back on also take
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:52.920]  some phone calls as well again I'm Alex Jones your host if you just joined us
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:58.200]  the question of course is Obama has posed the top brass as the litmus test
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:06.880]  will you fire on US citizens that is the litmus test Obama is saying to the top
[01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:12.720]  brass will you fire on US citizens and again we already have this in the new
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:17.760]  army training manual from 2010 that I'll go over the numbers for so you can pull
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:22.880]  it up at army.mil you've already seen the drills out there where the military
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:26.820]  practice is shooting large crowds of Americans that's going on in the news
[01:09:26.820 --> 01:09:32.560]  almost every day now the urban warfare training you saw the gun confiscation in
[01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.160]  Katrina you saw ABC News where they said yeah if you don't turn them in we shoot
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:39.880]  an American and the police chief says all the guns will be taken no one will
[01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:42.760]  be allowed to be armed and they're they're they're they're training the
[01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:46.580]  military to engage us under brigade homeland I mean that was in the Army
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:51.240]  Times three and a half years ago I've had colonels on from the army admitting
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:56.280]  you know they were doing gun confiscation drills in Arcadia Iowa that
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:04.640]  they now run army checkpoints in California Tennessee but a top retired
[01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:10.120]  general quote living military legend and there's been another military legend
[01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:14.080]  wink-wink general Boykin former head of Special Forces has come out and said our
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:19.080]  government's arming al-qaeda in Libya and Syria we're going into a police
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:24.280]  state our country's in deep trouble he's also in the film behold a pale horse
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:29.620]  that we sell with Charlie Daniels as the host of at info war store.com that's a
[01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.640]  side issue but general Boykin is in that I'm guessing it's general Boykin our
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.560]  guests will not say that's who told him this but this is a credible guy that's
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:42.040]  why we have dr. Garrow back on but I wanted him to recap go over the basics
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:47.200]  of the gear up towards despotism I mean who can deny that this is really out in
[01:10:47.200 --> 01:10:52.560]  the open now with our guest and and now he can also make some other points that
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:56.460]  he didn't get to last week and some new information and of course he also runs
[01:10:56.460 --> 01:11:04.400]  pink pagoda girls.com he's been over in China since 1968 with English language
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:08.040]  schools and some of his staff the government was trying to forcibly abort
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:13.200]  their kids also kill already born babies and so he started a group in 2000 that
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:17.440]  saved over 45,000 Chinese girls and I could certainly vouch for him because
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:21.120]  even a member of my crew has adopted Chinese girls out of China and is well
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:25.120]  aware of the pioneering work of pink pagoda girls the group he founded
[01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:28.880]  because they they'll die if they're not adopted you understand they kill them
[01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:35.040]  they kill them so just amazing and of course there's more people wanting to
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:39.000]  adopt kids every year in this country than there are even abortions but they
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.480]  never tell the young women at Planned Parenthood you know there's Christian
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.120]  groups that will pay for your whole pregnancy pay for your medical bill and
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:50.640]  depending on the group give you 20 to 50 thousand dollars after after you have
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.440]  the baby for not killing it you see those billboards up everywhere abortion
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:59.520]  you know need alternatives that's some of the Christian groups and then they
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:06.720]  even try to get you a job afterwards Wow so you want to go have a have a have an
[01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:10.720]  abortion that doubles your chances of cervical and uterine cancer going off
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:16.360]  the left field as always do now major studies have shown per abortion or get
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.960]  paid to have the baby and not have it killed oh but Planned Parenthood won't
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:25.920]  tell you that because their goal is to kill their eugenicist Margaret Sanger
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.440]  they want to quote kill the black weeds they were founded for that but moved on
[01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:34.080]  to everybody else of course but oh doesn't matter they get somebody up on
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.760]  MSNBC saying we gotta deal with the white crackers she gets some street
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.200]  lingo going out there cuz you know you talk about getting the white crackers
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:46.160]  that's cool that's liberal but oh hey let's not chop up the babies shut up
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:51.520]  racist okay let's go to our guest pink pagoda girls a founder dr. James Garrow
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:57.320]  PhD doc recap the Intel you've got the other info tell people what we're facing
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.640]  here you've got the floor well as you know and I stated last week the
[01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:07.640]  difficulty is that this is something more and more true either I was a little
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:11.600]  doubt for myself I have to be honest with you but more and more of the
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:15.280]  evidence coming forward since you know since we were putting it out to the
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:19.880]  public and of course you've known this for quite a while but it's just so
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:24.520]  scary about what is happening and as you see them marched down the roadway to
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:30.880]  despotism it is to me it's just mind-boggling but you know this army
[01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:36.560]  senior army officer retired who came forward and asked me if I would help him
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:43.240]  put the word out he was quite frightful of what was going on in America where
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:48.160]  things were going in terms of the fact that the military we're now going to be
[01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:54.360]  asked to take action against the American public and for doing what for
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:59.320]  rioting for no nothing like that it had to do with a scenario of would you in
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:06.000]  fact fire on people who had been in possession of arms had refused to allow
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:10.520]  confiscation of those arms or to lay down those arms which was it you know
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:14.120]  the right to hold under the Constitution the Second Amendment you're well aware
[01:14:14.120 --> 01:14:21.240]  of that but now would you as an officer order your troops to fire if the
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:26.000]  commander-in-chief you know who you have taken an oath to actually obey as
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:32.080]  commander would you obey that order so many have said no I think it's going to
[01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:36.120]  come out fairly soon that many people are saying no I've had so many phone
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:40.500]  calls Alex I gotta tell you between interviews and all of that I had so
[01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:46.800]  many people phoning me current military and retired military saying thank you
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:53.520]  thank you for bringing it up well we just want to thank you now listen have
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:58.360]  you talked to the retired quote military legend since he wanted you to warn
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:02.460]  people about this because again I can separately figure out who it is myself I
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:06.080]  can separately you know research the information to know that it's already
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:10.440]  being set up I mean it's publicly being set up have you talked to that
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:16.440]  individual anymore yes I have yes I have it was a very short conversation he
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.680]  called me and just said thank you and that was the extent of it so if you're
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:26.040]  if you're going into did you ask him to come forward again no I didn't get that
[01:15:26.040 --> 01:15:30.760]  chance in fact all he wanted to do was say thank you that's it so he just
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:34.080]  wanted you to get the info out and he thinks he's going to be safe having you
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:41.320]  do it instead of him coming out yes yeah very much he believes that what he's
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:46.800]  done is quite brilliant from from what I know of this person and and what we
[01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:51.440]  talked about how it was going to come out and why me and everything and to me
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:57.360]  it seemed to be not not as if he was a coward in any way and people have said
[01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:02.120]  that you know and sent me messages you know that oh he has to stand up he has
[01:16:02.120 --> 01:16:07.600]  to come forward actually no he doesn't watch Alex where things go in the in the
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.160]  near future and I think you'll appreciate that this man was right on
[01:16:11.160 --> 01:16:16.640]  with what he did let's face it he was not a dull-witted somebody who is
[01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:25.080]  unable to who are unable to strategize quite a brilliant map sure now expanding
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:29.520]  on that I never implied he was a coward I have seen some people say that but
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.840]  after you were on last week I began to think actually it makes sense because
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:40.800]  Smedley Butler when he exposed the Nazi fascist plan working with the bushes
[01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:44.560]  Prescott Bush at the time but he was just mid-level in it and a bunch of
[01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:50.240]  other people to have a fascist takeover in the 30s he went to Congress first and
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:55.880]  then that's how they rolled it up and I've been noticing now that did you see
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:17:01.000]  former Senator Hagel say to Obama you can't trust the military you're not in
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:05.160]  control of the Pentagon they're not doing what we say because I know the
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:08.200]  military over and over again has actually stopped some of these wars a
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:12.280]  lot of people say would lead to World War three possibly I mean does that tie
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:15.760]  into what you're saying we should look for in the future well I was certainly
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:21.520]  people are getting it aren't they if hey if this guy says you know this to Obama
[01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:27.600]  by way of warning it's a good warning and you know the military folks got so
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:32.800]  many of the rank and file phone me up and say you know what we would never
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.480]  turn our guns you can't miss the office who said that to us we turn them on them
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:41.920]  and that's the message that's kind of going out there Obama does not have the
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:48.880]  support of the military at all he thinks he can command and control but the man's
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:56.760]  living in la la land well he certainly is dr. James Garrow PhD joins us from
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:00.960]  Toronto Canada right now run some of the largest English-speaking at training
[01:18:00.960 --> 01:18:05.400]  schools in China and it's a 45,000 plus little Chinese girls that would have
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:08.160]  been killed or used in medical experiments I'm not kidding it's very
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:12.840]  macabre I want to talk some about how they kill those little girls before you
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.000]  leave us so we can you know put a human face on this and not just have it be a
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:21.400]  statistic but I've had countless military in fact I could I could scrub
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:23.920]  the phone calls right now but we're gonna go to them later I'm so I'm not
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.360]  going to and open the phones but we'll do that after we take some of these
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:32.280]  calls and say military call in are you being trained to take our guns are you
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:35.560]  being trained for for killing Americans and they'll call in and say yes indeed
[01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:39.480]  we are but again I have the army training manual in fact I'll pull it up
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.000]  here in a moment for radio and TV of yours I mean this is the new mission and
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:47.480]  and we're hearing now we got to have troops on the streets and all of this
[01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:53.800]  but I only see that serving to wake up the police and military oh amen that's
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.380]  exactly what's happening that's the result there's been a total
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:02.000]  miscalculation on the part of Obama and crew who don't have a military mindset
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:06.840]  they don't understand what loyalty really is and the fact that the military
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:11.240]  a lawyer to the American people they really are they believe in the role of
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:15.880]  being a protector to the American public and they've torn an oath of Constitution
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:21.720]  but listen who's behind the Constitution it is we the people nothing short of
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.160]  that that's it so bottom line these people are understanding it there's a
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:30.680]  huge as I said again I'm gonna say it it's a huge miscalculation and I mean
[01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:34.560]  if if there were people who had bad intent looking to control through the
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.200]  military the country this would be certainly a way to march toward that
[01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:44.080]  but mr. Obama has thought that he would be the one that would be able to have
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:50.280]  the loyalty of the troops and I'm sorry the troops are not stupid I want to find
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:56.040]  out of the retired military legend the general talked about false flags is he
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:20:00.580]  concerned from his sources about the globalist staging something show they
[01:20:00.580 --> 01:20:05.000]  would buy this looking back on 2012 we asked ourselves how did we ever survive
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:08.960]  from natural disasters like Hurricane Sandy and the devastating summer drought

[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:14.200]  brought on by a disastrous economy our hearts go out to those that have lost

[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:20.480]  you turn on your television you can feel it when you go to work when you go to
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:25.720]  church when you pay your tax it is the world that has been pulled over your
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:31.680]  eyes to blind you from the truth that you are a slave like everyone else you
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:36.200]  were born into bondage born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:41.320]  or touch a prison for your mind
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:50.840]  the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:55.080]  by the way in health news it's up on info Wars calm the video the interview
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:34:00.160]  Dorian Yates six-time mr. Olympian one of the most famous bodybuilders in
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.600]  history I guess only next to Schwarzenegger even I know that I don't
[01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.320]  even follow about a bodybuilding has come out against fluoride and talked
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:11.400]  about how deadly it is in the water supply and and that's good because then
[01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:14.560]  people like that will get to the bodybuilders and then famous soccer
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:17.680]  players have come out against fluoride and then people wake up there and then
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:23.320]  a teenage girl in Mississippi spends three years exposing a deadly very toxic
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:28.680]  chemical and Gatorade linked all sorts of problems cumulatively and and now
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:33.320]  Gatorades pulling it out I mean there is an example of solutions and the
[01:34:33.320 --> 01:34:37.560]  government is going to try to get more power and then sometimes you're gonna
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:43.240]  get real tyrants in charge that want to go for it all and that's why we need to
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:47.920]  say no warrantless checkpoints aren't to keep us safe it's to set up a police
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:51.080]  state and now they're saying the warrantless checkpoints aren't for
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:55.440]  al-qaeda now they're for gun owners and everything our guests was announcing I
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.520]  had to really bite my tongue and not interrupt a bunch about how we're gonna
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:35:01.760]  have more ankle bracelets that were found mentally ill how they can just
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:06.960]  announce it now under these new federal edicts they're saying and the Soviets
[01:35:06.960 --> 01:35:10.960]  and the Nazis did this Hitler the first people they killed had been grabbed and
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:16.000]  ordered mentally ill by psychiatrist and and just like in China they said all
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:19.240]  your kids got a clubfoot we're gonna kill your two-year-old they would take
[01:35:19.240 --> 01:35:22.560]  them into the doctor's office and then say oh they died of a heart attack
[01:35:22.560 --> 01:35:26.600]  there's actually documentaries on this they killed hundreds of thousands before
[01:35:26.600 --> 01:35:31.640]  they even started arresting political dissidents and it's eugenics it's like
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:36.360]  why are we seeing the same thing because Hitler didn't get it from Germany he got
[01:35:36.360 --> 01:35:40.360]  it from England and from the United States that developed modern eugenics
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:45.160]  and then he took it to an extreme level and quote discredited it so the Journal
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:49.920]  of eugenics switched over to the Journal of population and things like that and I
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:53.040]  covered that in our film in game blueprint for global enslavement
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:57.400]  available at info war store comm so important to see that so important to
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:36:01.840]  show it to your church now expanding here that we're going back to our guest
[01:36:01.840 --> 01:36:06.760]  you know beyond tangy tangerine and some of the other amazing things that have
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:10.240]  just basically every vitamin mineral trace element huge amounts of vitamin C
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:14.520]  huge amounts of the B vitamins they did a big Clemson study that they've been
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:19.000]  doing for several years you've got to go read this it's up at info wars comm from
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.720]  yahoo finance and we'll punch this up and post it on top of it it's in the
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:28.880]  health section of info wars comm video pharmacists exposes deadly
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:35.640]  antidepressants but then under that is the yahoo finance international al
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:38.960]  international announces results of Young Jevity clinical studies performed by
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:47.320]  Clemson University yahoo finance they took cancer cells from human cancer in
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:50.360]  the colon that's just exploding because of all the toxins and chemicals and of
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:55.760]  course it mutates the cells and the the the the Young Jevity beyond tangy
[01:36:55.760 --> 01:36:59.360]  tangerine it has some of the others as well you can go read the results in a
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:08.640]  scientific study went in and did not hurt the healthy cells and killed the
[01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:11.880]  unhealthy cancer cells now the reason I knew when I did this probably what was
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.520]  gonna happen is Linus Pauling got a Nobel Prize for this folks I don't know
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:18.760]  was it 40 years ago but it got suppressed so they're just redoing these
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:24.040]  studies but they it is the best stuff out there that's why I promote it info

[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:07.960]  articles or more on it but I want to give that out again people want to go
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:11.840]  look it up but after we take these five or six calls that are on the phone board

[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:27.980]  happen a few times a year now thousands of times a year checkpoints helicopter
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:33.680]  assaults Houston Miami Chicago all this week I've sent the guys two years ago to
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:37.520]  Chicago where they practice putting citizens in a sports stadium with
[01:39:37.520 --> 01:39:42.320]  foreign trips and again I've shot video where the Marines trained to put
[01:39:42.320 --> 01:39:46.000]  Americans in these facilities now it doesn't mean they'll get away with it
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.160]  you're not supposed to get scared and run and hide under a bridge because of
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.820]  this you're supposed to go hey this isn't morally right no no no if you
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:58.440]  cower see the globalists hope you just get scared and shut up and go along with
[01:39:58.440 --> 01:40:02.280]  them I'm looking for men and women who will go no we're gonna stand up against
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:09.280]  this and I want to I want to go back to our guest dr. Jim Garo who again is one
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:13.200]  of the largest chains of English-speaking teaching schools in
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:19.400]  China since 2000 save over 45,000 little Chinese baby girls who would have been
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:23.880]  killed after birth which they're now promoting here the big bioethics journal
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.720]  last year people didn't believe it when we published an article linked to them
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:33.400]  saying let's kill kids up to age three even if they're healthy that it took
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.480]  three days for mainstream media to pick it up saying it couldn't be true and
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.840]  they called it was a real study put out in their journal we're gonna get to that
[01:40:40.840 --> 01:40:43.440]  coming up we're keeping a little bit in the next hour if you can do it because
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:47.720]  again constitutional lawyer Bruce fine was stuck in court he apologized we
[01:40:47.720 --> 01:40:50.800]  appreciate him he's on tomorrow talk about the constitutional attacks that
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:55.640]  are going on and how to strike back against it but dr. Jim Garo is our guest
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:41:01.240]  right now what about my point because I'm not a tough guy but you know if
[01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:07.840]  tyranny is coming down on me I know instinctively or in my spirit to to say
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:11.800]  no and stand up against it now if I can get out of the way you know short term
[01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:16.880]  you know I sometimes I do try to back down but it depends on you know what the
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.800]  gut level decision is and I know giving into tyranny historically intellectually
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.320]  but also my gut tells me my gut says you will not back down like it's the
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.960]  opposite it's like I have absolutely no fear which is like Ezekiel you know
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:31.760]  saying in the Bible God they're gonna kill me but it burns in my bones I can't
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.120]  stop I mean it's the opposite of fear it's not courage I don't want to be
[01:41:35.120 --> 01:41:39.480]  thanked for what I do I can't control myself my whole gut my spirit my
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:44.500]  intellect intellectually it confirms it you stand up to moves to intimidate you
[01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:48.840]  and set up checkpoints and secretly arrest people and NDAA and all this you
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:53.360]  don't you don't get scared but so many people email me and write me and go what
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:57.640]  you say is true but I'm scared I've got ulcers I'm an officer in the army I
[01:41:57.640 --> 01:42:02.120]  don't know what to do and I don't know about that spirit of fear you know good
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:06.720]  thank God we know thank God people spoken up thank God this has come out
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:11.440]  thank God what do you say to those that don't get this and think oh my gosh
[01:42:11.440 --> 01:42:15.880]  what's the point of knowing this it's so negative isn't it positive to know so
[01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:22.040]  that we can contend and wrestle with this evil absolutely you know what I
[01:42:22.040 --> 01:42:25.720]  would do with those people who aren't willing to listen you you're you're not
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:30.320]  responsible for them you're really not you're responsible for your own belief
[01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:34.720]  system and then you're responsible for your own family so you know very much
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:39.240]  like planning for anything else in life you plan for the survival of yourself
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:42.600]  and your family that's what you've got to do that's what we're looking at we're
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:46.560]  not we're not just this isn't theory now these people are moving they're making
[01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.840]  moves forward that will take away your freedom they take away the guns remember
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:54.480]  the first thing that the Germans did was declared that Jews were not quite people
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:58.960]  and then the first people to lose the right to own a gun were the Jews and of
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.480]  course that made them the easiest to be rounded up let's be careful here again
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:10.760]  the caution should be think plan figure out your escape route figure out what
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:13.800]  you will do when they come knocking on your door at night do you have something
[01:43:13.800 --> 01:43:17.320]  to back you up if that happens or are you just going to be a ready victim
[01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:21.880]  they'll just march in your home and take you and your family confiscate the guns
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:25.960]  and take you and your family away do you have a plan for that that's what you
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:30.640]  need to do let's start planning and I mean there are people out there who who
[01:43:30.640 --> 01:43:34.960]  are accused of being you know the crazies the tinfoil hat kind of people
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:40.600]  but and conspiracies theorists well you know conspiring together that's what law
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:45.800]  is all about we make a social contract we conspire together to come up with the
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.240]  laws and a way to handle and control society well this is going beyond that
[01:43:50.240 --> 01:43:54.440]  and now they're going to handle and control us now what are you going to do
[01:43:54.440 --> 01:43:58.520]  about what it is going to be your plan for your family I think you need to look
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:02.360]  to that first and foremost responsibility and get it very clear
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:06.760]  have plans know what you're going to do know what you're going to do in the long
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:14.880]  term I agree with you but my point is they won't get away with this if we
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.280]  simply challenge him and you know folks have always said the archival image of
[01:44:18.280 --> 01:44:22.200]  the crazy guys he's yelling well we're yelling to get people out of their coma
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:26.520]  some people are smooth like you other people like myself get upset I also
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:31.360]  sometimes I'm calm but I found I've been successful not on purpose I didn't do
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:35.200]  this on purpose by being upset sometimes to get people out of their learned
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:41.600]  helplessness out of their mass Stockholm syndrome out of their normalcy bias
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:46.720]  because I mean things have gotten so crazy I want to read this quote but if I
[01:44:46.720 --> 01:44:51.680]  say I will not mention him or speak any more in his name his word is in my heart
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:58.480]  like a fire a fire shut up in my bones I am weary holding it in indeed I cannot
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:01.880]  because my uncle about 15 years ago I'm sitting across the coffee table from
[01:45:01.880 --> 01:45:05.360]  he's a big Bible scholar probably listening right now my mom's brother
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:10.320]  great guy Vietnam vet helicopter pilot patriot lived all over the world and I
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:13.280]  said you know I can't help it when they death threat me I can't help it when
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.640]  they get my face I I don't understand people that are afraid of the new world
[01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:21.760]  order I can't shut up it's a burning and then he quoted the scripture to me which
[01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:25.720]  I've never read but I mean I just wish other people had the burning in their
[01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:30.120]  bones I mean I guess you're saying if someone's not called to fight evil I
[01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:35.640]  guess that I mean you're saying just triage them no no I'm saying look to the
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:39.800]  first responsibility that you have which is to your family make a plan for them
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:44.120]  but make sure that your plan is thorough that you understand they will come when
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:47.440]  you least expect it they're not going to come in broad daylight they'll come at
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:51.280]  night when you're asleep they'll bang it on your door when you're least prepared
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:55.240]  to react properly that's when this is going to start to happen they've already
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:01.680]  you know done the groundwork they've got the evidence on you test last year where
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:05.440]  Brandon Robin all these Marines honorably discharged officers no
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.040]  criminal record would mildly criticize Obama and they would have the police
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.360]  come and mentally commit them it's happened to a bunch of talk show host
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:15.560]  already last year yeah and look what they're saying they're saying that
[01:46:15.560 --> 01:46:20.000]  anyone who's been a veteran it's been overseas comes back you're you're
[01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:24.280]  immediately suspect of being a terrorist or a terrorist threat what's that about
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.520]  you mentioned Hitler first they went after a group who'd been demonized and
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:32.440]  unpopular the Jews but it but then they went after every group you know the
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:35.480]  famous quota they went after the Jews I wasn't a juice I didn't stand up they
[01:46:35.480 --> 01:46:38.200]  went after the Methodist I wasn't a Methodist I didn't stand up I mean by
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:43.760]  the end of it the Nazis my grandfather became an inventor because in Dallas
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:47.360]  growing up he lived next door to a famous inventor had been involved in
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:52.880]  venting indoor refrigeration or taking those systems indoor air conditioning
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:46:57.720]  and so and this guy was a German immigrant since he was a little kid but
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:01.360]  he spoke German and my grandfather you know had a lot of German ancestors so he
[01:47:01.360 --> 01:47:05.440]  spoke some German Germans that came into Texas so they became friends he worked
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:10.360]  with him some the Germans extorted he told me this story when I was a little
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:15.720]  kid all the money out of that guy before and then right up to World War two
[01:47:15.720 --> 01:47:19.600]  threatening to kill his family and the guy wasn't Jewish so I mean that people
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.920]  that say all the Nazis you know didn't really do all this stuff baloney and
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:27.200]  I'm telling you it's the same organized crime system that we're now seeing
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:31.920]  unfold I mean this is a great danger oh amen and the fact that you've been
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.680]  cautioning people for years to me is like wow you've been thinking ahead you
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:40.360]  know you've been that that's the problem though you're so far ahead of the curve
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:44.600]  of the reality of today like like everyone's secure it we're snug as a bug
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:49.240]  in a rug things are working well society is great we got power we got water we
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:53.320]  got gas in our car we can go on holiday we got money in the bank we got a job
[01:47:53.320 --> 01:47:59.280]  yeah well wait until all of it is cut off what's your plan that's that's what
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:03.360]  I'm I keep coming back to it like we're not talking about what what my officer
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.560]  friend cautioned beyond but basically where he went with the whole the whole
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:13.000]  scenario was what will the public do when they finally pulled the plug on
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:17.300]  everything and well that's the deal they're there they're deriding the banks
[01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:21.560]  they're deriding the country they're saying we're gonna go double the the the
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:27.720]  the the debt to our GDP they're doing it on purpose to make us dependent and what
[01:48:27.720 --> 01:48:30.480]  will happen when they drop the hammer I guess they're gonna say do what you're
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:33.840]  told or starve to death and I want people to know when the global is take
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:36.960]  down America it's not gonna be creeping anymore they're gearing up for an
[01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.760]  all-out assault and scream yeah yeah that's great absolutely a lightning war
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:47.640]  I mean it's incredible against us and man I tell you folks don't be afraid
[01:48:47.640 --> 01:48:52.160]  speak out now I believe it's gonna backfire and they may back off if here's
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:55.800]  the problem they've committed to an economic collapse they may not be able
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:59.880]  to stop but but I see every sign they're trying to just accelerate the collapse
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.400]  while posing as the Savior Alex you're absolutely right the signs that I'm
[01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.160]  getting and the word that I'm getting back is that when I was told this that
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.680]  last Monday morning that since we put it in to the public view look at the things
[01:49:13.680 --> 01:49:18.800]  that have happened bang all of a sudden we've got well you know better what's
[01:49:18.800 --> 01:49:22.640]  going on I don't know the list of things that are going on but things are
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:27.520]  accelerating I think what we've helped to do is push them through fear and the
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:30.640]  purchase of guns and ammo that's the big thing for they weren't counting up they
[01:49:30.640 --> 01:49:34.320]  didn't count that the American public go in that direction you know what they
[01:49:34.320 --> 01:49:37.280]  were hoping for was that everyone would just you know everything business as
[01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:41.840]  usual you know it's only the government doing this doing that Obama you know if
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:47.480]  they're kindly at the comedy father the great smile that he's not people he's
[01:49:47.480 --> 01:49:52.600]  he's not gonna do anything to us this is all for our good sounds very much like
[01:49:52.600 --> 01:49:58.600]  how Hitler was viewed as well the night that's coming and I keep saying it's
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:02.960]  night because actually scripture talks about a night it's not when you're ready
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:06.040]  for it it's it's at night that they're going to come and this is all going to
[01:50:06.040 --> 01:50:11.800]  happen it's in that night when you will need to be prepared so what are you
[01:50:11.800 --> 01:50:14.640]  doing to protect your own family what are you doing to network your
[01:50:14.640 --> 01:50:20.000]  neighborhood so that there is a group of people to protect one another because
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.840]  remember something it's overwhelming force that they're being taught to use
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:29.240]  overwhelming force what happened at Waco and I bring up Waco as an example
[01:50:29.240 --> 01:50:34.520]  because here was overwhelming force and in the end they just brutalized and
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:38.760]  murdered all those women and children and then the military posed with the
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:42.040]  skulls they were very very proud of the work they don't they could have arrested
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:47.040]  Koresh in town who went into town every day and had a business in town we're

[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:17.280]  that this odd device poses the gravest threat we've ever known in fact just a
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:20.560]  few weeks ago former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:24.680]  piece for the Washington Post warning about this deadly threat I can't believe
[01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:28.600]  that more people aren't talking about this it may be because the liberals and
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:32.720]  the government are trying to cover it up that's why my friend just created a free
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:38.300]  video at weird device calm that exposes this threat and blows the doors off the
[01:53:38.300 --> 01:53:43.120]  conspiracy go watch the shocking video at weird device calm right now to
[01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:47.640]  discover exactly what it is plus discover the number one way you and your

[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.240]  population out there inside this giant reeducation camp that has become America
[01:54:39.240 --> 01:54:42.360]  need to ask themselves do you want to be slaves under this now again we got a
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:45.840]  bunch of calls for our guests they'll be all over the map some of them were
[01:54:45.840 --> 01:54:49.680]  holding before he got on with us but then as each person hangs up we're only
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:55.200]  taking calls in the next hour of military and police I mean again in fact
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.120]  we put the army manual back up on screen if you haven't taken it down to people
[01:54:58.120 --> 01:55:02.840]  the 2010 army manual internment and resettlement operations how to scan your
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:06.640]  social security number how to put the children in one area of the camp how to

[01:55:12.140 --> 01:55:16.520]  internment resettlement operations so there's more proof of what our guest is
[01:55:16.520 --> 01:55:23.520]  saying or the Army Times admits it Brigade homeland the big police chief
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:28.440]  summit that they had Jan Napolitano at shed the new threat is an al-qaeda just
[01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:35.480]  just this week but Monday the new threat is returning veterans gun owners
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:39.960]  conservatives and libertarians we are violent radical extremists because we
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:43.640]  know that globalists have taken the country over and again our guest is dr.
[01:55:43.640 --> 01:55:49.360]  Jim Garo let's go to Diane then we'll go to Jeannie and others Diane you want to
[01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:54.200]  talk about martial law go ahead well I got a couple things first of all I think
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:58.200]  I'm in good company I guess I'm mentally ill because I believe there's an evil
[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:02.200]  plan but I'm not gonna get in fear it's gonna be scary but I've read the book
[01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:07.400]  and I know how it is it's gonna be good I was wondering if you could confirm on
[01:56:07.400 --> 01:56:12.320]  one of these sites you've had on before it's news.com but there was evidently a
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:16.720]  truck pulled over that they found the martial law signs in the truck in
[01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:20.440]  Houston and then I've been reading more and more articles I'm trying to keep
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:24.040]  moving for you more I've been reading more and more articles about martial law
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:28.360]  just being inflicted in the home where when we finally run out of food and
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:31.440]  supplies will come out and submit and I was wondering what you thought about
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:35.640]  that I have an uncle that's retired from the Air Force that thinks we're total
[01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:40.600]  crackpots that there will not even be a problem with the economy or anything
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.520]  against our guns for 10 or 20 more years and he just retired in the last six
[01:56:44.520 --> 01:56:49.320]  years and yeah notice people that are delusional think it's all gonna happen
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:53.560]  after they die it's always and see it's the old-timers that held all this back
[01:56:53.560 --> 01:56:59.720]  and see that's the the paradox Patriots hold it back but still we're sliding so
[01:56:59.720 --> 01:57:04.480]  we slowed it down and then as everything starts to happen like we said oh it's
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.360]  supposed to be worse than this as we battle to win the war against these
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:13.360]  people I mean it's such a mind game now that's been played but no unfortunately
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:17.400]  that martial law sign thing I've been hearing for 17 years it's a proverbial
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:20.760]  deal they're not gonna call it martial law it's gonna be called civil emergency
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:24.840]  and they're already look it's martial law when the TSA sticks their hands down
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.920]  your pants it's martial law when the police have checkpoints in your town
[01:57:27.920 --> 01:57:33.200]  it's martial law when the TSA is down on Lamar right now running checkpoint
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.840]  searching people without warrants in Austin where I live it's martial law
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:40.840]  when the military does drill in cities every day I want to go back to our
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:45.000]  guests thank you for the call ma'am you know what about her point about martial
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:49.440]  law we're always looking for martial law martial law if there is a big martial
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:52.720]  law it's what about false flags I asked that question earlier you never got to
[01:57:52.720 --> 01:57:57.640]  it what about Obama staging things well you know and by the way I didn't hear
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:05.240]  any of the the caller's words at all I'm sorry I was so but in terms of what he
[01:58:05.240 --> 01:58:09.920]  does let's face it I think I said this before he's an incrementalist that's
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:13.720]  what he does it's by small increments that he sees what he can get away with
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:19.440]  and continues to go further and further and further at every turn so in terms of
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:24.200]  martial law remember he's looking for a crisis and then he will as they said he
[01:58:24.200 --> 01:58:28.840]  we will manage the crisis so the management of that crisis may be that

[02:01:09.200 --> 02:01:12.120]  they're willing to do all this why wouldn't they stage something they've
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:17.320]  done it before but wasn't Benghazi also something was staged basically it was
[02:01:17.320 --> 02:01:21.280]  meant to be a kidnapping I suppose it a quasi pseudo kidnapping of the
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.960]  ambassador and then he would work it through the details so that in the end
[02:01:25.960 --> 02:01:31.800]  you had the blind sheik being released so that the dear leader could once again
[02:01:31.800 --> 02:01:39.000]  look heroic to the Muslim population and instead he got killed instead the whole
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:45.080]  thing and you know what two gentlemen stood up and put their lives on the line
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.840]  and held back 500 people for how many hours Alex eight hours and screamed for
[02:01:50.840 --> 02:01:56.000]  help and were denied it even though they had what a gunship up there they had two
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:02:00.840]  drones and a gunship up there over the eight hours and the help was denied why
[02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:05.000]  did they want him dead and you know this is all this is all information it's
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.840]  available that we know that they had the gunship we we know that they had the
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:14.120]  drones there we know that they had the laser targeting and these people were
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:18.320]  left whatever happened out you know don't leave any man behind I mean this
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:23.640]  this man in the White House is and I cannot believe no morals no scruples
[02:02:23.640 --> 02:02:27.600]  well he gets away with anything and that's what's so scary he's been given

[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:53.120]  street corners with a sign that says you know 9-11 was an inside job or whatever
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:58.480]  you know whatever you wanted to put on it and I actually have 16 signs that
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:04.520]  line my front yard almost like the old political signs from useless people that
[02:03:04.520 --> 02:03:08.920]  are running for city councils and stuff I actually have 16 signs that have
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:15.640]  different various things from 9-11 to vaccines I have a six-year-old grandson
[02:03:15.640 --> 02:03:21.120]  that's got brain damage from vaccines when he was 18 months so I advocate for

[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:15.300]  you
[02:08:24.440 --> 02:08:27.960]  ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna do a special report on this this week I've
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:33.000]  talked a lot about it over the years and shown the news articles but it's close
[02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:41.520]  to 59,000 when I checked last week people have died since 2007 in Mexico
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:45.840]  it's approaching 60,000 and and I believe there's tens of thousands they
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:50.080]  don't know about that have been buried there's some estimates over 50,000
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:55.800]  missing so that could be a hundred and nine thousand but more people die every
[02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:00.840]  year in Mexico than died in the decade of the Vietnam War 58,000 Americans died
[02:09:00.840 --> 02:09:06.960]  roughly over that decade-long plus conflict we're talking about 59,000
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:13.400]  since 2007 so five and a half six years and we need to get that number out
[02:09:13.400 --> 02:09:19.260]  because all guns have been taken in Mexico from the people and the reason I
[02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:23.920]  raised that is at least three shot at office complex in Phoenix Arizona this
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:30.880]  is just breaking the last 15 minutes or so and an employee at a law office in
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:35.160]  the area told newspapers he had seen four people take him in on stretchers
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:38.680]  that's we've also got helicopter shots of that television footage shows dozens
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:43.280]  of officers entering a building where police say people are injured and again
[02:09:43.280 --> 02:09:48.320]  it's either gangs it's somebody going postal or it is a Prozac head it's
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:52.680]  always the same mo the answer is have guns in there because there's a bad
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.040]  person with the guns gonna kill you just like Mexico they got the highest crime
[02:09:56.040 --> 02:10:00.380]  rate in the world they don't have the highest city though Mexico City is at
[02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:03.760]  number one Chicago is by the way the Chicago Police Chief I've got that in
[02:10:03.760 --> 02:10:08.560]  the stack he's saying don't worry you know we've had a 530 something killed
[02:10:08.560 --> 02:10:12.080]  last year we've taken all your guns highest crime rate for any city in the
[02:10:12.080 --> 02:10:16.400]  world it's not that bad that's the quote the Associated Press fact I have even a
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:20.080]  video clip of him I was seeing this morning it's not that bad though he's in
[02:10:20.080 --> 02:10:23.960]  press conferences wanting you to turn your guns in where he's taking the guns
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:27.920]  the murders aren't that bad oh but it's sandy hook terrible that this guy got
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:32.760]  guns illegally and and now you got to turn your guns in but when people get
[02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:38.920]  killed in his gun-free zone it's a no big deal so numerous emergency vehicles
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:41.720]  are at the scene video footage showing a person being taken on the gurney I
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:46.440]  reached at the scene and it's gotten the point with more kids built a Lego it
[02:10:46.440 --> 02:10:50.520]  looked like a gun with a Lego so the SWAT team was called that happened today
[02:10:50.520 --> 02:10:54.120]  it's this total hysteria people drive by and see a kid with a nerf gun bright
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:10:59.200]  orange helicopters police foaming at the mouth hyperventilating bubble
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:02.400]  projectors now the police are being called and there's nothing more deadly
[02:11:02.400 --> 02:11:06.840]  than a pink Hello Kitty bubble gun I want to go back to our guest Jim Garrow
[02:11:06.840 --> 02:11:10.320]  and he want to talk about some solutions and standing up he's somebody that knows
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:16.200]  how to stand up and we're gonna go to James in Colorado who's a marine who can
[02:11:16.200 --> 02:11:20.840]  comment on has he been told you know are you ready to fire on American citizens
[02:11:20.840 --> 02:11:24.800]  and the lines are open just for military people now we've got some others that
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:28.640]  are holding from before I'll get to you as well but eight hundred two five nine
[02:11:28.640 --> 02:11:33.440]  ninety two thirty one our guest of course let's talk to a quote living
[02:11:33.440 --> 02:11:37.200]  military legend who says he's talked to other officers who are being told now as
[02:11:37.200 --> 02:11:41.200]  a litmus test will you fire on citizens well I have the Army manual where they're

[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:18.280]  your point about solutions standing up in your words then we'll go to that
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:22.680]  marine well let's face it in your in your local community that's where you
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:27.160]  have your biggest fear of influence generally that's just a normal joke like
[02:12:27.160 --> 02:12:30.920]  just you and I and in our in our little neighborhood so what you do is you run
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:36.120]  for office you run for dog catcher you run for police chief you run for
[02:12:36.120 --> 02:12:40.000]  whatever's I want to give an illustration of the use of a linsky
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:45.960]  tasks tactics I ran for school board in my local town I want I got on there I
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.520]  started you know putting the boots to the the people who were just rubber
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:53.760]  stamping whatever the administration wanted in the school district and it
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:59.480]  meant spending money like like a drunken sailor so what they did is utilize the
[02:12:59.480 --> 02:13:04.240]  media media fully socialist Marxist up here in Canada where I am at the moment
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:09.720]  and I was back then and so they use that a linsky method they freeze you they
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:14.080]  demonize you and they cause it that no one will listen to you because the media
[02:13:14.080 --> 02:13:19.320]  of course tells the tale and controls the message and that's what they will do
[02:13:19.320 --> 02:13:23.960]  you must have a vehicle some way of getting your message out if you're
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:27.960]  gonna run for anything so that the truth is always available to the public the
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:32.440]  public you serve but make sure that you have that vehicle if you don't have it
[02:13:32.440 --> 02:13:36.860]  you're dead because the media will cripple you they will freeze you they
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:41.240]  will demonize you they will put you out of business so no one listens to you but
[02:13:41.240 --> 02:13:46.240]  now governor Cuomo who wants to basically ban all our guns total gangster
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:52.600]  his his brother is now the morning CNN anchor but CNN's top show has half a
[02:13:52.600 --> 02:13:56.560]  million their average show about 90,000 they are an illusion they are imploding
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:00.600]  in fact there's news today when I was there and I've been to their studios
[02:14:00.600 --> 02:14:07.080]  three times it looked like a third world facility I don't want to describe it but
[02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:10.440]  I mean the the bathrooms because after I saw one I said they put me in this on
[02:14:10.440 --> 02:14:15.360]  purpose I went and checked a few more the carpet light bulbs out dirt on the
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:20.120]  floors in the studios horrible morale I mean these guys are falling apart but
[02:14:20.120 --> 02:14:26.560]  here it is Cloward Piven strategy and of course that's the 1966 sociologist that
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:30.440]  I first told people about 15 years ago that books have been now written about
[02:14:30.440 --> 02:14:36.720]  by others my greatest success is even though you know I'm I'm not Rush Limbaugh
[02:14:36.720 --> 02:14:40.400]  and Glenn Beck they just I make stuff popular and they pick it up which I
[02:14:40.400 --> 02:14:46.280]  think's great you know I force it out there but it was a plan to bankrupt New
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:50.600]  York City and other cities to make you accept socialism the plan is to get you
[02:14:50.600 --> 02:14:55.680]  dependent and this is published and officially used by the Democratic Party
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:14:58.840]  that's why they're gonna shut off your power plants they're gonna raise taxes
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:03.160]  on working poor until you give up and go on welfare they want to run your life
[02:15:03.160 --> 02:15:07.520]  let's go to some Marines here we've got James in Colorado we'll go to him in a
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:13.640]  moment but first JC in Montana marine with news on general so we'll see what
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.200]  that's about and then we've got Army National Guard Matt and Florida again
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:22.200]  you just joined us our source a top general retired told him that they're
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:26.480]  they're doing a litmus test now will you fire on US citizens and if not you're
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:30.080]  ordered to resign your Commission I have all the background proving that's
[02:15:30.080 --> 02:15:33.760]  already happening I found that in the news and in Army manuals the last three
[02:15:33.760 --> 02:15:39.200]  years it's changed but what's unprecedented is totally unprecedented is
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:46.520]  the the new sec def nominee Hagel came out and said you cannot trust the
[02:15:46.520 --> 02:15:50.600]  military they're not on your side Obama you've got to have a purge of them if
[02:15:50.600 --> 02:15:55.480]  you want your new world order that was Washington Post yesterday okay we wrote
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:00.800]  an article about it at info wars calm I mean this is going on and it's a big
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:07.640]  deal so let's go to JC JC well what can you tell us hey Alex hey Jim how's it
[02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:13.440]  going that's going all right um first of all General Mattis mad dog
[02:16:13.440 --> 02:16:22.040]  Mattis from CENTCOM was fired and I'll read you what the blaze put on it's like
[02:16:22.040 --> 02:16:28.400]  United States Marine Corps general James mad dog Mattis was notified he was being
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:34.160]  replaced as commander central command not by a phone call from Washington but
[02:16:34.160 --> 02:16:39.720]  by a note by his aide according to foreign policies Thomas E Ricks general
[02:16:39.720 --> 02:16:43.560]  Mattis was traveling in a meeting when an aide passed him a note telling him
[02:16:43.560 --> 02:16:47.120]  that the Pentagon had announced his replacement as head of Central Command
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:52.120]  and I saw that a while back for generals in the last month have been relieved and
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:56.880]  and the CENTCOM folks are angry because they begged the White House in the
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:00.720]  eight-hour Benghazi operation to let them bomb the targets and were ordered
[02:17:00.720 --> 02:17:07.920]  to stand down that's come out CENTCOM general Mattis is loved he's a good man
[02:17:07.920 --> 02:17:14.640]  he's a he's a marine I mean I'm a marine I mean everyone loves this guy I mean I
[02:17:14.640 --> 02:17:21.440]  don't know if Jim's force was referencing Jim he's probably referencing
[02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:26.080]  someone younger the way he talks that it was mentored by the general that he
[02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:30.960]  knows but when Mattis is out of Central Command something's wrong I mean there's
[02:17:30.960 --> 02:17:40.800]  no reason I mean and some of the some of the stuff I read was general Mattis said
[02:17:40.800 --> 02:17:45.600]  he doesn't have the balls to come down here and tell me himself I mean this was
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:50.960]  kind of man he is well you don't get a name like mad dog for being diplomatic
[02:17:50.960 --> 02:17:58.160]  but I mean this was a man that protected America loved America and well that's
[02:17:58.160 --> 02:18:03.920]  probably the reason he's not in CENTCOM no more but uh well no there is a look
[02:18:03.920 --> 02:18:08.560]  look the military purge is already confirmed but but the but the the new
[02:18:08.560 --> 02:18:13.360]  Secretary of Defense are trying to confirm that the nominee says you can't
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.040]  trust the military and they're purging them all around us I appreciate your
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:22.400]  call god bless you this just backs up everything Jim Garo Dr. Garo sang from
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:26.240]  the MO and I looked it up and I know these guys run in the same circles I
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:29.280]  believe it's General Boykin the former head of Special Forces because he's
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:32.400]  already speaking out already know people that know him well he's anti New World
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.200]  Order he's in the film that we sell Behold the Pale Horse with Charlie
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:41.520]  Daniels he's speaking out right now about tyranny I believe it's General
[02:18:41.520 --> 02:18:45.920]  Boykin but yeah what about the general purge of the military and the new
[02:18:45.920 --> 02:18:50.400]  Secretary of Defense is a top globalist Hagel a fake Republican a fake
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:55.200]  conservative saying that you know that Obama can't trust the military well to
[02:18:55.200 --> 02:18:59.520]  do that what an admission here are the people that are ready to lay their life
[02:18:59.520 --> 02:19:04.560]  on the line I mean think about this the difference here you got the military
[02:19:04.560 --> 02:19:08.240]  ready to lay their lives on the line you got the politicians what are they ready
[02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:13.040]  to lay they're ready to go out and have a great wine and cheese at your expense
[02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:16.560]  and supposedly your purport to be representing you and they're the ones
[02:19:16.560 --> 02:19:20.160]  that are afraid of the military well they should be afraid of marriage
[02:19:20.160 --> 02:19:24.000]  military because they have not lost their sense of priority
[02:19:24.000 --> 02:19:28.080]  politicians have lost the priority and Leon Panetta remember last year he
[02:19:28.080 --> 02:19:32.160]  wouldn't go to any bases with any of the even the officers armed
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:36.720]  remember that yeah could it be that they really uh would
[02:19:36.720 --> 02:19:40.720]  rather not see him well I mean that's why they want to go
[02:19:40.720 --> 02:19:45.680]  to robots and drones because despots have always hated
[02:19:45.680 --> 02:19:49.600]  having to have real men do the killing for them and so they despise them that's
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:51.200]  why as soon as they're out of the military
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:54.400]  they're the number one enemy of homeland security you heard me again this is
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:57.840]  public this is admitted our government says the military is the
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:01.600]  terrorist I mean wake up folks

[02:24:06.320 --> 02:24:09.680]  by the way one of the many generals that they've
[02:24:09.680 --> 02:24:13.280]  kicked out is it's way more than four in the last few months it's been four
[02:24:13.280 --> 02:24:19.680]  uh james mattes he said in order to kill the enemy you have to kill
[02:24:19.680 --> 02:24:22.960]  an innocent don't take the shot don't create more enemies
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:26.880]  than you can take out by some immoral act see that's what they don't like
[02:24:26.880 --> 02:24:29.680]  though they want people who think it's tough to
[02:24:29.680 --> 02:24:32.560]  just you know put al-qaeda in charge and then
[02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:36.000]  later go in and fight al-qaeda after you give them control of syria
[02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.800]  and a lot of the generals have been saying we should not be given missiles
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:41.280]  to al-qaeda we should not i mean obviously you
[02:24:41.280 --> 02:24:43.840]  shouldn't be doing this and the system doesn't care
[02:24:43.840 --> 02:24:47.360]  they're going full speed ahead they think the public is so dumb
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.920]  our government centcom had to put al-qaeda in charge of libya
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:55.600]  now in syria and that's why they've removed
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:59.920]  it's three top officers out of centcom alone so when i say four
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:02.960]  total it's way more than that i mean they're they're kicking people out
[02:25:02.960 --> 02:25:08.240]  everywhere there is a purge there is a purge of the military
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:11.440]  because they don't want to be used domestically and they don't want to work
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:17.120]  with al-qaeda and we're forcing that public debate and
[02:25:17.120 --> 02:25:19.920]  that's a good thing uh let's uh talk with our guest who's
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:22.320]  going to write shotgun with us for the rest of the hour
[02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:26.880]  let's go ahead and talk to kevin the marine in texas

[02:25:38.000 --> 02:25:41.360]  on gun confiscation we know they've been creeping around with that for a while
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:44.720]  but let's go to kevin kevin you're on the air go ahead and give us your point
[02:25:44.720 --> 02:25:48.400]  hey thanks um just to go on with what you're saying about that whole purge of
[02:25:48.400 --> 02:25:52.720]  the military well the marine force reserve is
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:56.480]  actually doing a fizz rig where every unit's getting realigned
[02:25:56.480 --> 02:25:58.640]  and a different mls which is going to
[02:25:58.640 --> 02:26:02.720]  actually bring up you're going to have thousands and
[02:26:02.720 --> 02:26:06.960]  thousands upon marine being dropped dropped out kicked out of
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:09.760]  the military you got to make places for the new women to fight in the front
[02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:14.080]  lines well right but like at my unit we don't
[02:26:14.080 --> 02:26:17.920]  we're a combat arms unit but we're not like
[02:26:17.920 --> 02:26:22.480]  infantry we're uh tracks and stuff 98 of my unit
[02:26:22.480 --> 02:26:25.520]  is going to be dropped and that's going on across
[02:26:25.520 --> 02:26:28.880]  across the nation so you're going to have all these
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:32.560]  marines being dropped dropped out of the military and then to go on along with
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:36.080]  what you were saying you know about uh how the military's not on your side
[02:26:36.080 --> 02:26:39.600]  blah blah blah this is gonna i guess the way i'm the
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:42.240]  way i'm thinking is it's gonna actually have a
[02:26:42.240 --> 02:26:47.200]  a effect on you know how you say did you hear als charpton basically say we don't
[02:26:47.200 --> 02:26:51.280]  need the military anymore we have drones and then if americans cause problems

[02:33:26.960 --> 02:33:29.680]  they're in army outfits look like they are army
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:32.080]  so they don't look like they're doing too good with all that gear so those
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:34.880]  must be police you can tell they hadn't been carrying
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:38.400]  they can't carry gear 100 yards much less 50 miles
[02:33:38.400 --> 02:33:44.720]  punch that back up that is amazing and and and and they're saying that that
[02:33:44.720 --> 02:33:48.320]  they think a man with a gun did something to the driver and grabbed a kid
[02:33:48.320 --> 02:33:52.000]  off the bus i mean this is just getting bizarre
[02:33:52.000 --> 02:33:56.720]  folks and if they keep hiding uh you know all this brainwashing out
[02:33:56.720 --> 02:33:59.600]  there alabama police and hostage standoff with suspect
[02:33:59.600 --> 02:34:04.160]  in fatal school bus shooting kidnapping
[02:34:04.160 --> 02:34:07.200]  and i mean who knows if that was somebody's
[02:34:07.200 --> 02:34:11.760]  dad who wanted his kid back or something who knows this country
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:16.160]  the alabama man police they shot and killed a school bus driver
[02:34:16.160 --> 02:34:19.760]  to uh well that was tuesday so i guess they're going back to it we just saw
[02:34:19.760 --> 02:34:22.640]  that breaking and i thought not a new thing and now i guess they've
[02:34:22.640 --> 02:34:24.240]  tracked him down and they're going after him
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:28.320]  but again there's 315 million people our crime rate
[02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:36.960]  violent crime rates down 49 since uh 1991
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:42.160]  you can pull those statistics up at fbi.gov 21 of that just since 2007 so
[02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:47.520]  it's accelerating but the media can take the events of 300
[02:34:47.520 --> 02:34:50.880]  300 well this is saying moments ago i guess they've tracked him down where
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:52.800]  he's at yeah that's what's happening so the
[02:34:52.800 --> 02:34:55.600]  school bus thing happened yesterday now they've tracked down where they
[02:34:55.600 --> 02:34:59.520]  believe he's at that's why they're it's it's it's new breaking news that
[02:34:59.520 --> 02:35:03.200]  this happened just as we were going back live uh here on the radio
[02:35:03.200 --> 02:35:06.720]  uh again right he was our guest the last hour he's riding shotgun when we take
[02:35:06.720 --> 02:35:11.040]  your calls in this hour uh and he's dr jim garrow
[02:35:11.040 --> 02:35:15.280]  he heads up www dot pink pagoda girls dot com
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:19.520]  that's a group that saved since 2000 45 000 plus
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:22.880]  chinese newborn babies that would have been infanticided
[02:35:22.880 --> 02:35:27.920]  killed which the major journals bioethics journals are now basically
[02:35:27.920 --> 02:35:31.280]  saying is a great thing to do here in the united states just
[02:35:31.280 --> 02:35:35.200]  absolutely hellish they say kill the old people kill the babies nobody needs them
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:38.160]  you'll get more tax money if we kill people once they
[02:35:38.160 --> 02:35:41.040]  communalize and get things collectivized then they
[02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:44.560]  can tell you how to live your life it's it's and then people dying
[02:35:44.560 --> 02:35:48.560]  as bill gate says you kill grandma that's a death panel that's a quote
[02:35:48.560 --> 02:35:51.520]  then you hire 10 teachers and the teachers clap
[02:35:51.520 --> 02:35:55.120]  that's the sick collectivist model instead of grow the pie
[02:35:55.120 --> 02:35:58.720]  and then you become north korea and everything collapses but they love it
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:02.640]  but uh going back to the caller who was a
[02:36:02.640 --> 02:36:06.160]  marine i think in colorado did he hang up
[02:36:06.160 --> 02:36:09.040]  because he said he was a marine but i couldn't really understand yeah he
[02:36:09.040 --> 02:36:12.640]  dropped off he was talking about
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:15.600]  i couldn't really tell what he was getting into and then i said i'd come
[02:36:15.600 --> 02:36:17.760]  back to him but i guess he didn't understand that
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:22.320]  uh let's talk to matt in florida army national guard
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:26.960]  matt in florida uh wants to comment again we know the army manuals who just
[02:36:26.960 --> 02:36:30.000]  joined us in the last three years now trained for
[02:36:30.000 --> 02:36:32.960]  gun confiscation and we know the military is being
[02:36:32.960 --> 02:36:35.120]  prepared for domestic operations that's admitted
[02:36:35.120 --> 02:36:38.640]  they're saying the new enemy is not al-qaeda it's conservatives libertarians
[02:36:38.640 --> 02:36:43.440]  gun owners but now we've seen that the incoming if
[02:36:43.440 --> 02:36:46.320]  it gets confirmed secretary of defense former senator
[02:36:46.320 --> 02:36:49.520]  hagel saying the military can't be trusted
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:53.120]  you know that obama if he wants his new world order has to deal
[02:36:53.120 --> 02:36:56.400]  with the pentagon that they're not following orders
[02:36:56.400 --> 02:37:00.640]  we know what the orders are give al-qaeda missiles set up checkpoints on
[02:37:00.640 --> 02:37:03.120]  highways the military's been saying no so there's
[02:37:03.120 --> 02:37:06.800]  a huge purge going right now if you're a new listener folks it's
[02:37:06.800 --> 02:37:10.400]  mainstream news the government gives all kind of weapons now publicly
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:14.240]  well why not they can take our liberties when they attack i mean i mean this all
[02:37:14.240 --> 02:37:17.680]  is is so diabolical uh but let's go to another caller here
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:20.560]  matt in florida you're on the air go ahead
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:24.560]  yes um i've been commissioned for you know almost 11 years now
[02:37:24.560 --> 02:37:28.000]  um i've been in the guard double time and i will
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:31.360]  smile my up front i will never confiscate anybody's guns i will
[02:37:31.360 --> 02:37:34.480]  fight that order i will never shoot on my fellow
[02:37:34.480 --> 02:37:38.880]  of citizens i'll fight that's why they got the guys in katrina from another
[02:37:38.880 --> 02:37:41.680]  state because they knew their guys in their own state their own
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:44.640]  neighborhood wouldn't confiscate their fellow neighbors
[02:37:44.640 --> 02:37:49.440]  guns see that's ridiculous if i'm from texas i wouldn't take new yorkers guns
[02:37:49.440 --> 02:37:52.400]  i mean how is it different from a different state
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.240]  well it's just it's just it's mental i think i mean if you're sitting there
[02:37:56.240 --> 02:37:58.960]  right in your own city and that's why they originally got these guys that's
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:01.680]  why a lot of them now i've come back and said well that's
[02:38:01.680 --> 02:38:05.200]  ridiculous why did i do that i you know a lot of them were brainwashed a lot of
[02:38:05.200 --> 02:38:08.240]  the young guys that just didn't know any better by the way that's what the soviets
[02:38:08.240 --> 02:38:10.240]  did and at tiananmen square the same thing
[02:38:10.240 --> 02:38:13.440]  that's why they had to wait eight hours they brought troops in from 300 miles
[02:38:13.440 --> 02:38:15.600]  away from another province that spoke a
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:19.760]  different type of chinese yeah and so my concern right now is this
[02:38:19.760 --> 02:38:22.560]  whole dual status commander thing and i know you've tried to talk about
[02:38:22.560 --> 02:38:26.320]  before but it's where a general in the in the national guard can command
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:29.680]  troops from um the active duty so they can come down
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:32.800]  as long as the governor says yeah it's good they'll come in and they'll be able
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:36.000]  to basically be on the street with our soldiers you know shoulder to shoulder
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:38.560]  with our national guard troops and that's you know
[02:38:38.560 --> 02:38:40.800]  and then the round on posse comitatus and
[02:38:40.800 --> 02:38:45.680]  it's ridiculous i mean it's it's just another way of them creating in that
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:48.960]  active duty component they you know they don't know the rules and regulations of
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:52.160]  the national what do you make of the new army manuals that
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:55.600]  train for gun confiscation and lockdown of u.s cities
[02:38:55.600 --> 02:38:58.880]  it's ridiculous and i've showed that to some guys and they're like holy cow the
[02:38:58.880 --> 02:39:03.040]  guys in my unit they're like this is this is unbelievable where's this you
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:06.240]  know and so the the reason i'm staying in and i've
[02:39:06.240 --> 02:39:09.680]  last few years my wife has always asked me why are you staying in you know you
[02:39:09.680 --> 02:39:12.720]  had the you know thing that you say about the military well it's like i stay
[02:39:12.720 --> 02:39:16.320]  in because i want to warn people i want to wake people up that's why
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:21.520]  that's my beautiful um and then every time i go to drill on my weekend
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:24.400]  every month i i talk to them about what's going on i wake
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.920]  to wake people up all the time that's why they want to have the litmus test
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:30.400]  purge is to get the good people out and again
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:34.320]  the military itself is individuals it's who's in command of
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:36.320]  it people say well you're anti-military you
[02:39:36.320 --> 02:39:41.120]  don't want checkpoints on the highway no i'm pro-constitution it's like saying
[02:39:41.120 --> 02:39:43.680]  i'm anti-ford truck i'm not anti-ford truck
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:47.120]  i don't want a crazy person running me over with a ford truck it's just like
[02:39:47.120 --> 02:39:51.280]  i'm not anti-gun i'm anti bad people with guns but bad people
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:55.120]  always have guns so i'm gonna have my gun don't blame me
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:39:59.680]  for what somebody else does beautiful comments i want to bring up dr garrow to
[02:39:59.680 --> 02:40:03.360]  bring up any points he's got well you know the whole psychological
[02:40:03.360 --> 02:40:07.040]  breakdown here of loyalties because of familiarity
[02:40:07.040 --> 02:40:10.800]  uh... that's a classic as a classic move to break down
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:12.600]  uh... not only the
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:13.440]  uh... the loyals
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:16.800]  he won two another for for example you know that the guy you've worked with
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:18.120]  been trained with this dinner
[02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:20.680]  look after you and and and have your back
[02:40:20.680 --> 02:40:24.400]  in a combat situation and you know that you're going to be loyal or they know
[02:40:24.400 --> 02:40:28.360]  that you're going to be loyal to the guy who trained you at the officer above you
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:29.840]  uh... or overall
[02:40:29.840 --> 02:40:35.040]  policy the general uh... who has uh... showing themselves to be honorable and
[02:40:35.040 --> 02:40:37.120]  uh... and very loyal to their man
[02:40:37.120 --> 02:40:40.440]  and been a real leader i mean that's that's real loyalty well they want to
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:43.820]  break that down they want to break it down because if if they can break the
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:45.680]  familiarity pattern
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:49.800]  uh... yes one another and knowing what the expectation is they can bring in
[02:40:49.800 --> 02:40:51.320]  somebody new and guess what
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:53.880]  you'll do what they say why don't know any better
[02:40:53.880 --> 02:40:58.040]  but but then that actually destroys the military but they don't care the heart
[02:40:58.040 --> 02:41:01.600]  of military is the honor and taking care of each other because they don't care
[02:41:01.600 --> 02:41:04.800]  they want you to act like robots because they want robots
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:08.240]  they'll follow their orders that's why they're going to robots
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.400]  no man left behind happened we've just seen a huge demonstration of the fact that
[02:41:12.400 --> 02:41:15.120]  that no longer exists with the commander in chief
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:17.000]  well it wasn't just left behind
[02:41:17.000 --> 02:41:20.440]  a lot of evidence shows they were he wanted actually that ambassador killed
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:23.120]  because he wasn't playing ball they were transferring missiles
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.540]  to al-qaeda we know they stood down for eight hours
[02:41:26.540 --> 02:41:30.720]  with troops right down the street at a substation base in order to stand down
[02:41:30.720 --> 02:41:32.720]  and only two navy seals
[02:41:32.720 --> 02:41:36.600]  refused to not follow orders and went down and held off five hundred guys for
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:40.040]  eight hours i mean this is just incredible
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:42.720]  it is this is that
[02:41:42.720 --> 02:41:46.000]  coming up some good news out yesterday
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:47.440]  let me bring up some good news

[02:42:05.580 --> 02:42:08.640]  the most that were going to tell you about a little most of the road is that
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:09.880]  that's happening right now
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:11.200]  there's a lawsuit
[02:42:11.200 --> 02:42:13.380]  uh... it's against unlawful
[02:42:13.380 --> 02:42:15.360]  tyranny filed against uh...
[02:42:15.360 --> 02:42:16.620]  mister obama
[02:42:16.620 --> 02:42:20.640]  at the united states government for acting like a king
[02:42:20.640 --> 02:42:22.020]  uh...
[02:42:22.020 --> 02:42:25.960]  and it's here has been filed as a lawsuit uh... is to set us in who is
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:28.160]  there is a proper has no money
[02:42:28.160 --> 02:42:29.880]  uh... approach the court
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:31.360]  uh... made his case
[02:42:31.360 --> 02:42:32.100]  in fact
[02:42:32.100 --> 02:42:35.400]  the judge wanted to throw it out but for the wrong reason
[02:42:35.400 --> 02:42:37.560]  and so he's come back refile
[02:42:37.560 --> 02:42:41.560]  and uh... having he's having her removed because she's an obama appointee
[02:42:41.560 --> 02:42:44.620]  uh... who was obviously trying to protect obama because
[02:42:44.620 --> 02:42:46.120]  this is kind of
[02:42:46.120 --> 02:42:48.180]  it's about the natural law
[02:42:48.180 --> 02:42:50.840]  uh... and uh... having an unnatural
[02:42:50.840 --> 02:42:52.120]  uh... born citizen
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:56.720]  by the way uh... obama has uh... two courts have slapped him down
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:42:59.820]  for doing unconstitutional things on recess appointments
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:02.880]  uh... and other areas uh... caller matt in florida
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:06.460]  a uh... national guard officer anything else you'd like to add
[02:43:06.460 --> 02:43:10.420]  yeah the other thing is um... guys that are in the army war college
[02:43:10.420 --> 02:43:14.300]  you know as a national guardsman and they're basically being
[02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:17.000]  talking about this whole dual status command thing
[02:43:17.000 --> 02:43:21.520]  almost all the guys and luckily the guy that i know we've been there
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:25.360]  was against the dual status commander they were actually trying to do regional dual status
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:27.160]  commanders which they have a
[02:43:27.160 --> 02:43:30.940]  as they have a commander that would be in charge of federal states
[02:43:30.940 --> 02:43:34.080]  and uh... yeah what they're doing is they've created the ten
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:37.520]  yeah they've created the ten regions with the governor saying you don't need
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:41.160]  fifty so oh we we have governors the the governors
[02:43:41.160 --> 02:43:44.440]  we appointed yeah they're they're trying to totally get rid of any
[02:43:44.440 --> 02:43:48.240]  state control of the national guard when it's always been state go ahead
[02:43:48.240 --> 02:43:51.520]  that's what i said i was like you know he said that that basically goes against all state
[02:43:51.520 --> 02:43:53.280]  sovereignty law i mean that's just
[02:43:53.280 --> 02:43:57.880]  basically he says the law of that governor and i guess they would have to be in on it
[02:43:57.880 --> 02:43:59.460]  but still it's just like
[02:43:59.460 --> 02:44:02.700]  you know the state sovereignty doesn't exist anymore at that point i mean
[02:44:02.700 --> 02:44:06.160]  the final thing was i know you talked about this before as well but that that uh...
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:10.520]  guard experience magazine that came out that comes out and i get it and i got it
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:13.160]  since it was the middle of uh... year last year
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:16.640]  and they had on the front cover the thread at home and they had a guy
[02:44:16.640 --> 02:44:20.600]  his face was blacked out and he was in military uniform full battle gear
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:22.600]  and it's like the thread at home talks about how
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:27.640]  our returning veterans and he's on a guard national guard magazine and like
[02:44:27.640 --> 02:44:28.480]  this is
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:33.100]  i mean i i don't know if you're trying to every angle they're trying to you know
[02:44:33.100 --> 02:44:37.440]  throw this at us and it's like it's completely ridiculous when they send our guys over
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:42.480]  three four five six times huffed up on painkillers and depression medicine and they
[02:44:42.480 --> 02:44:46.640]  and they come back and they wonder why they're upset or angry or they come back and
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:50.440]  you know life is totally flipped upside down and they wonder why these guys are
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.820]  are you know a little off you know it's completely ridiculous
[02:44:54.820 --> 02:44:58.000]  absolutely god bless you and i appreciate your call we're gonna go to more military
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.160]  calls but first get another comment from uh... doctor jim garrow
[02:45:01.160 --> 02:45:04.800]  who's on with us right now but if we punch this up for tv viewers
[02:45:04.800 --> 02:45:08.500]  uh... you can see at info wars dot com june first
[02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:11.940]  two thousand and twelve we were mailed a copy of this
[02:45:11.940 --> 02:45:15.940]  the actual magazine this is what the national guard is all mailed
[02:45:15.940 --> 02:45:18.240]  national guard magazine cover story
[02:45:18.240 --> 02:45:21.080]  specifies americans as great as terror threat
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:24.000]  well it actually says veterans
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:27.700]  they're telling you you're the terrorist now go fight yourself
[02:45:27.700 --> 02:45:31.000]  and let's continue the latest edition of the guards experience
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:34.640]  the national guards official magazine features a cover story titled the threat
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:35.800]  at home
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:39.340]  and it is a guy in a national guard uniform
[02:45:39.340 --> 02:45:41.460]  with explosives tucked in
[02:45:41.460 --> 02:45:44.340]  who and what are the biggest dangers to homeland security
[02:45:44.340 --> 02:45:47.340]  now if you're a foreign megabank that took over america
[02:45:47.340 --> 02:45:48.980]  you're getting ready to fully gut it
[02:45:48.980 --> 02:45:52.520]  you're gonna say the veterans who were patriots and willing to fight they're
[02:45:52.520 --> 02:45:53.780]  the enemy
[02:45:53.780 --> 02:45:58.260]  i mean imagine if it is out of a simpsons episode with the spaceship lands
[02:45:58.260 --> 02:46:01.960]  what's the name of the simpsons town
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:03.020]  springfield
[02:46:03.020 --> 02:46:06.400]  uh... it's one of the few episodes i've seen and and and uh...
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:09.200]  the spaceship lands and ugg and gugg these big
[02:46:09.200 --> 02:46:10.920]  fourteen foot green aliens
[02:46:10.920 --> 02:46:13.420]  we are your rulers and the mayor and the
[02:46:13.420 --> 02:46:14.840]  rockefeller guy
[02:46:14.840 --> 02:46:18.840]  uh... comes up and says yes you're right we bow to you which is exactly how it
[02:46:18.840 --> 02:46:19.700]  would work
[02:46:19.700 --> 02:46:23.420]  this would be like a giant flying saucer landing announcing will destroy your
[02:46:23.420 --> 02:46:24.660]  planet from orbit
[02:46:24.660 --> 02:46:26.180]  if you don't bow to us
[02:46:26.180 --> 02:46:28.640]  and by the way the new enemy is anyone that says
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.480]  that the planet booble bapper or whatever isn't in control
[02:46:32.480 --> 02:46:35.740]  and uh... you know now here's your new guard magazine
[02:46:35.740 --> 02:46:38.960]  anyone that says aliens don't have a right to rule you as the enemy i mean
[02:46:38.960 --> 02:46:42.020]  you know founding fathers are bad george washington's bad
[02:46:42.020 --> 02:46:44.740]  uh... bill of rights is bad private property bad
[02:46:44.740 --> 02:46:47.800]  a mouse a tongue good tyranny good i mean this is what they teach at the
[02:46:47.800 --> 02:46:49.060]  colleges
[02:46:49.060 --> 02:46:50.720]  and now they're saying that
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:54.320]  alex jones and they say in articles on a terrorist i'm a radical i'm gonna kill
[02:46:54.320 --> 02:46:56.900]  people cnn said they need to kill me
[02:46:56.900 --> 02:46:59.680]  because i'm gonna kill them and they would want to be in a room with me
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:02.260]  because i might kill on my have no criminal record
[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:05.240]  i mean these are mad dog tyrants
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:07.980]  and you know since the guy mentions that see when i'm listening to a guest or
[02:47:07.980 --> 02:47:09.680]  caller i know they're for real
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:12.200]  cuz i'm immersed in this stuff
[02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:15.460]  okay i'm not bragging i mean i live this i'd read this
[02:47:15.460 --> 02:47:18.020]  so that they're saying things i know they're true or not
[02:47:18.020 --> 02:47:19.940]  truth is already know almost all the stuff
[02:47:19.940 --> 02:47:22.220]  i just have folks on to give their views on it
[02:47:22.220 --> 02:47:24.940]  and different perspectives i'm here to get you to be aware of it
[02:47:24.940 --> 02:47:28.800]  but the callers like it's so ridiculous they're teaching us the military or the
[02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:29.960]  number one terrorist
[02:47:29.960 --> 02:47:31.600]  in our own magazine
[02:47:31.600 --> 02:47:34.880]  that's because they really are in power i'm sorry go ahead
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:38.720]  they're stealing the last thing which back to that i think i think about that
[02:47:38.720 --> 02:47:40.080]  uh... you've got a fact
[02:47:40.080 --> 02:47:43.360]  you've got all about the man who's given service to the country and he's the
[02:47:43.360 --> 02:47:47.000]  terrorist okay now the public's looking at terrorist
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:48.080]  redefining
[02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:49.700]  redefining the language
[02:47:49.700 --> 02:47:51.720]  are we not
[02:47:51.720 --> 02:47:54.040]  yes i mean i mean it's incredible
[02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:57.320]  okay connect and do we have some time to talk just for a second about about
[02:47:57.320 --> 02:48:00.920]  something that goes way back to this whole notion of redefining things is
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:02.160]  stealing the language
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:03.340]  absolutely
[02:48:03.340 --> 02:48:06.160]  can we do that don't let me go
[02:48:06.160 --> 02:48:10.340]  yes go give it to us let me let me go way back way back let's go into the
[02:48:10.340 --> 02:48:11.520]  bible for a second
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:12.400]  do you remember
[02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:14.320]  do you remember when all of the disciples
[02:48:14.320 --> 02:48:16.060]  polls first came together
[02:48:16.060 --> 02:48:17.600]  remember it says something about
[02:48:17.600 --> 02:48:18.640]  and they had
[02:48:18.640 --> 02:48:21.660]  they held everything in common
[02:48:21.660 --> 02:48:23.960]  they held everything in common
[02:48:23.960 --> 02:48:26.200]  it meant that the rich people brought in
[02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:29.320]  uh... the goods and services that they had in the dollars that they have
[02:48:29.320 --> 02:48:31.280]  because god had blessed them with it
[02:48:31.280 --> 02:48:32.280]  what was the notion
[02:48:32.280 --> 02:48:35.240]  they were going to share it they were going to have it in common
[02:48:35.240 --> 02:48:38.420]  not a redistribution of wealth it's a big difference here there's a huge
[02:48:38.420 --> 02:48:39.360]  difference between
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:42.560]  as sociological kind of thing that marxist kind of thing
[02:48:42.560 --> 02:48:43.760]  that they're talking about
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:45.020]  obama and crew
[02:48:45.020 --> 02:48:47.520]  so they held everything in common
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:51.180]  later on we have the english or the british common law
[02:48:51.180 --> 02:48:52.160]  what's it come out of
[02:48:52.160 --> 02:48:54.660]  it comes out of the scriptures
[02:48:54.660 --> 02:48:56.220]  what has obama dot
[02:48:56.220 --> 02:48:57.540]  he has taken
[02:48:57.540 --> 02:49:03.700]  common ism common ism and turned it into communism two different things
[02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:05.240]  gives glory to god
[02:49:05.240 --> 02:49:06.640]  for the balance
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:08.940]  further blessings that he has given
[02:49:08.940 --> 02:49:11.820]  and the responsibility do you have one to another
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:15.540]  as christians or citizens one to another
[02:49:15.540 --> 02:49:17.520]  you hold things in common
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:18.480]  that's black
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:22.940]  and if you notice boston common it what that isn't that that piece of land that
[02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:25.340]  everyone has in common
[02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:29.340]  is to be the principal park in the downtown of all the little villages
[02:49:29.340 --> 02:49:32.420]  that were around the little towns there were comments
[02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:36.200]  they were areas where they've been it was happy in common it was a privately
[02:49:36.200 --> 02:49:40.800]  owned it was probably out it was held in common for the good of the common man
[02:49:40.800 --> 02:49:42.580]  the common man
[02:49:42.580 --> 02:49:46.500]  obama and crew are doing and and they're teaching this universities is stealing
[02:49:46.500 --> 02:49:51.320]  the language so you think that because you give something away to someone that
[02:49:51.320 --> 02:49:53.760]  that's being a good socialist
[02:49:53.760 --> 02:49:57.840]  giving into those who have to have me because you have
[02:49:57.840 --> 02:49:59.340]  well that's not what it is
[02:49:59.340 --> 02:50:01.580]  the original christian message was that we
[02:50:01.580 --> 02:50:03.400]  polls all things in common
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:08.000]  from the bounty of god who gave it to us so we share that bounty of god as a
[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:09.260]  responsibility
[02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:11.100]  not as a social nightmare
[02:50:11.100 --> 02:50:13.680]  but defined by marxist
[02:50:13.680 --> 02:50:16.540]  i'm just bringing that up for for uh... short message
[02:50:16.540 --> 02:50:19.820]  there now you're absolutely right and right now on screen for t b viewers
[02:50:19.820 --> 02:50:23.320]  i'm showing the p d f of the national guard magazine
[02:50:23.320 --> 02:50:26.720]  and it says the number one threat in here is gun owners veterans and things
[02:50:26.720 --> 02:50:27.420]  like that
[02:50:27.420 --> 02:50:30.460]  next al-qaeda it puts malicious
[02:50:30.460 --> 02:50:32.100]  next al-qaeda
[02:50:32.100 --> 02:50:34.000]  next a counterfeiting

[02:50:36.140 --> 02:50:38.880]  and says it's the military's job
[02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:40.340]  now to operate
[02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:42.020]  domestically
[02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:45.900]  and it's in search of the hidden enemy look everywhere but washington
[02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:48.140]  with the globalists that have taken over
[02:50:48.140 --> 02:50:49.120]  trust
[02:50:49.120 --> 02:50:51.820]  no one
[02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:55.720]  the government again that is the message they hammer home
[02:50:55.720 --> 02:50:59.060]  more calls for military jason marine robin others
[02:50:59.060 --> 02:51:01.780]  national guard straight ahead

[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:06.680]  carpet if there was ever marshall you know that was in the news actually about
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:08.480]  ninety four it was clinton
[02:56:08.480 --> 02:56:11.240]  uh... yes so they tried this before the good news is
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:13.820]  they try we fight they try we fight
[02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:16.420]  it's an eternal battle go ahead
[02:56:16.420 --> 02:56:20.900]  right exactly so what they did was since the united states military said no
[02:56:20.900 --> 02:56:22.020]  faces okay
[02:56:22.020 --> 02:56:25.300]  will bring in foreign troops on the united nations
[02:56:25.300 --> 02:56:29.560]  that they did and yep and they hate them in the united nations biosphere is
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:31.480]  around the country
[02:56:31.480 --> 02:56:34.440]  well they don't even hide and they do the open training now under n l e and
[02:56:34.440 --> 02:56:36.540]  all the rest of the god bless you great points
[02:56:36.540 --> 02:56:39.220]  uh... your comments on that doctor garrow
[02:56:39.220 --> 02:56:42.820]  well i mean let's face it uh... these people are planning to get a long range
[02:56:42.820 --> 02:56:44.060]  plan in place
[02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:47.300]  uh... i think that they don't think it's a rather big groups
[02:56:47.300 --> 02:56:48.000]  moment
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:49.140]  until you think
[02:56:49.140 --> 02:56:50.680]  figures honesty covered out
[02:56:50.680 --> 02:56:53.380]  but don't you think that uh... poor obama's got a going out
[02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:55.420]  you shouldn't have said that in public
[02:56:55.420 --> 02:56:58.940]  but we have the benefit of honesty for a change
[02:56:58.940 --> 02:57:02.340]  well i mean hagel has been a builder burger hagel is somebody they really
[02:57:02.340 --> 02:57:06.260]  like a you know ninety plus percent of the votes when he won the senate
[02:57:06.260 --> 02:57:08.340]  work out on a company he owned
[02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:12.340]  so that you give an idea about all all mister hagel let's jam in one more real

[02:57:34.980 --> 02:57:36.360]  and when things go down
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:39.780]  the national guard guys will melt back into the populace

[02:58:12.700 --> 02:58:14.060]  that's because

[03:00:43.700 --> 03:00:46.460]  uh... you know they did that with building seven they said it had fallen
[03:00:46.460 --> 03:00:49.780]  in its own footprint before it did an hour before and then
[03:00:49.780 --> 03:00:51.860]  they said the same thing about jfk
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:54.140]  because they get their timing off sometimes
[03:00:54.140 --> 03:00:58.300]  uh... let's go ahead and uh... go to jesse jesse what did you say

[03:01:00.580 --> 03:01:03.040]  uh... senator watching the local news
[03:01:03.040 --> 03:01:06.760]  and they hadn't even finished blocking the building down
[03:01:06.760 --> 03:01:10.340]  and the reporter goes let's go back to
[03:01:10.340 --> 03:01:13.860]  the congressional hearings that coincidentally
[03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:14.800]  are
[03:01:14.800 --> 03:01:16.500]  being held
[03:01:16.500 --> 03:01:20.820]  over begun violence and kathy gifford is having
[03:01:20.820 --> 03:01:22.960]  you know her speech there
[03:01:22.960 --> 03:01:26.260]  pushing all this propaganda from obama
[03:01:26.260 --> 03:01:27.860]  and
[03:01:27.860 --> 03:01:29.660]  this guy mark kelly goes
[03:01:29.660 --> 03:01:33.980]  yeah i have information that there was a shooting in phoenix arizona this morning
[03:01:33.980 --> 03:01:35.740]  with multiple injuries
[03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:37.540]  and the people weren't even
[03:01:37.540 --> 03:01:40.660]  at the hospital yet being reported locally
[03:01:40.660 --> 03:01:44.060]  but they already knew inside the congressional hearing
[03:01:44.060 --> 03:01:47.720]  well that's because homeland security is wired into all the local police
[03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:49.100]  departments now and
[03:01:49.100 --> 03:01:52.100]  but we need to time that because this won't be the first time they screwed up if that's
[03:01:52.100 --> 03:01:55.220]  what happened sometimes they reported before it even starts and that's how we
[03:01:55.220 --> 03:01:56.460]  catch them
[03:01:56.460 --> 03:02:00.160]  yeah and it but he was knowing that there was multiple
[03:02:00.160 --> 03:02:04.220]  multiple injuries and it's called it's called jumping the gun
[03:02:04.220 --> 03:02:07.920]  uh... i'll have to look into that we were recording it this morning
[03:02:07.920 --> 03:02:11.480]  and so we'll look into it thank you so much great point by the way aaron dikes
[03:02:11.480 --> 03:02:12.940]  ran in with this report
[03:02:12.940 --> 03:02:14.060]  msnbc
[03:02:14.060 --> 03:02:17.780]  uh... edit portrays gun owners as heckling father
[03:02:17.780 --> 03:02:19.540]  of sandy hook victim
[03:02:19.540 --> 03:02:21.980]  remember msnbc is being sued
[03:02:21.980 --> 03:02:24.300]  for editing the the zimmerman tape
[03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:27.940]  or zimmerman's going uh... okay there's a guy with a hoodie walking around okay
[03:02:27.940 --> 03:02:29.380]  uh...
[03:02:29.380 --> 03:02:32.060]  what's he doing he's doing this uh... what color is the uh... looks like he's
[03:02:32.060 --> 03:02:32.980]  black
[03:02:32.980 --> 03:02:36.620]  they added it to yeah there's a guy walking with a hoodie he's black
[03:02:36.620 --> 03:02:38.460]  and then got caught doing it so
[03:02:38.460 --> 03:02:39.500]  this is breaking
[03:02:39.500 --> 03:02:42.420]  uh... cable propaganda network deliberately edits out
[03:02:42.420 --> 03:02:45.420]  sandy hook family member asking audience a question
[03:02:45.420 --> 03:02:48.840]  which gun rights advocate responds to and makes it look like
[03:02:48.840 --> 03:02:50.300]  heckling
[03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:52.220]  uh... we're going to uh...
[03:02:52.220 --> 03:02:54.740]  let's add the part about zimmerman in here
[03:02:54.740 --> 03:02:57.540]  i think that's very very important to show they have a
[03:02:57.540 --> 03:02:58.500]  history of this
[03:02:58.500 --> 03:03:00.340]  speaking of msnbc
[03:03:00.340 --> 03:03:01.980]  uh... let's go to a clip
[03:03:01.980 --> 03:03:05.100]  of one of their people uh... on there
[03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:05.860]  uh...
[03:03:05.860 --> 03:03:07.620]  saying uh... crackers
[03:03:07.620 --> 03:03:11.640]  again get white people to think everybody who's of color is racist this
[03:03:11.640 --> 03:03:16.540]  is open race-baiting this this is racism to create racism for divide and conquer
[03:03:16.540 --> 03:03:17.660]  here it is
[03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:22.020]  those you know crazy crackers on the right like if they start with their very
[03:03:22.020 --> 03:03:23.700]  hateful language
[03:03:23.700 --> 03:03:28.040]  that is going to kill them in the same way the death knell for republicans is the
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:33.180]  tone of the conversation they absolutely have even have a white woman
[03:03:33.180 --> 03:03:36.560]  uh... this uh... finney come out and say it
[03:03:36.560 --> 03:03:40.200]  and and it's led by that you don't turn your guns in your races cracker
[03:03:40.200 --> 03:03:43.500]  you don't turn your guns in your southerners are trash al sharpton
[03:03:43.500 --> 03:03:46.900]  that overcome the southerners and the constitution i mean it's just
[03:03:46.900 --> 03:03:50.940]  it's it's absolutely we're northerners we're gonna get the southerners
[03:03:50.940 --> 03:03:54.340]  trying to get northerners act like that when others are like that it's
[03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:55.940]  we have the all sharpened about drones
[03:03:55.940 --> 03:03:59.900]  here's al sharpened about door your guns mean nothing we got the drones now
[03:03:59.900 --> 03:04:03.380]  here it is i mean if you look at the second amendment
[03:04:03.380 --> 03:04:06.980]  it was that you would have a militia to protect yourself
[03:04:06.980 --> 03:04:11.180]  in case the government came and attack citizens first of all
[03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:14.480]  if the government were to come to disarm you
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:17.660]  you would not be able to use an automatic weapon to defend yourself
[03:04:17.660 --> 03:04:19.740]  let's be serious we're in a world
[03:04:19.740 --> 03:04:21.780]  of drones now so
[03:04:21.780 --> 03:04:26.740]  the second amendment would not help you in that area we're talking about people do
[03:04:26.740 --> 03:04:31.940]  not have the right to unregulated rights you see and everybody's really smiling when they hear
[03:04:31.940 --> 03:04:35.100]  about the drones oh those are our drones the government loves us yeah the
