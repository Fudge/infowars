[00:00.000 --> 00:12.800]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:12.800 --> 00:26.400]  Alex Jones, the foray conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:26.400 --> 00:36.400]  Alex Jones, Russian scum.
[00:36.400 --> 00:42.400]  Until war comes to mind.
[00:42.400 --> 00:54.400]  Reputation's amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:54.400 --> 00:59.400]  President Trump has officially gone to war with the deep state.
[00:59.400 --> 01:02.400]  He has finally taken the gloves off.
[01:02.400 --> 01:10.400]  And I have this from public events that have taken place in the last week to sources very close to the president in the White House.
[01:10.400 --> 01:15.400]  But, ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing incredible developments.
[01:15.400 --> 01:29.400]  I'm going to be laying them out here on this special Sunday broadcast July 7th, 2019.
[01:29.400 --> 01:36.400]  We always talked about the Achilles heel of the deep state is child molestation.
[01:36.400 --> 01:47.400]  That's the currency, child molestation, child abuse, child murder, child trafficking, organ harvesting from children, that this is the currencies they trafficking.
[01:47.400 --> 01:55.400]  Not just illicit drugs and weapons or stolen art. Those are all secondary to their main currency, children.
[01:55.400 --> 02:17.400]  And Jeffrey Epstein and the fact that he had dozens and dozens of flights with Bill Clinton to the sex island and that Bill Clinton was reportedly in those logs criminally, in some cases, only his initials and the initials of other people on board.
[02:17.400 --> 02:25.400]  Now, since 9-11, any plane taking off has to have a manifest of whose honor you have as private, especially when you leave the country.
[02:25.400 --> 02:29.400]  I have been consulted one of my Air Marshal friends this morning on it. He confirmed that that is the law.
[02:29.400 --> 02:35.400]  But I've flown on people's private jets and they get your driver's license and run it before you take off.
[02:35.400 --> 02:58.400]  It's a big group. It's run before on a manifest. Well, guess what happened, ladies and gentlemen? Federal court ordered on July 3rd. It came out July 4th. Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pages of suppressed information that Obama, during his administration to the FBI and Mueller, who was also involved with Epstein, had suppressed.
[02:58.400 --> 03:10.400]  And so, ladies and gentlemen, this is so huge. Jeffrey Epstein has been re-arrested. He only got a slap in the wrist before and barely spent any jail time.
[03:10.400 --> 03:24.400]  He was a massive kingpin trafficker, supplying hundreds of girls a month to rich and powerful men, mainly in the Democratic Party, some in the Republican Party.
[03:24.400 --> 03:39.400]  And because this was the weak spot of the Clintons and others using this to blackmail people, of course Bill Clinton imbibed Hillary's more into women, that they tried to blame this on Trump early on and people like Alan Dershowitz.
[03:39.400 --> 03:49.400]  That's all blown up in their face. The documents have been released and it proves that Bill Clinton was flying on board planes with 12, 13, 14-year-old girls to a sex slave island.
[03:49.400 --> 04:00.400]  This makes the latest sex slave cult bust look tame in comparison and it's exactly what we knew was going on from our sources and everything we've been laying out for years.
[04:00.400 --> 04:16.400]  So we're completely and totally vindicated. I'm going to lay all this out in the next segment and the exhibits and just how huge this is and what this means that Trump's taking the gloves off and how it ties into everything else that we're looking at.
[04:16.400 --> 04:27.400]  Also, we're going to look at the giant earthquake that hit out in California with top scientists saying the next one could be up to 125 times.
[04:27.400 --> 04:38.400]  You heard me right. Stronger and it would look like something out of the Rocks movie, San Andreas. That's pretty much what it would look like if you ever had an earthquake that big.
[04:38.400 --> 04:47.400]  It's something like Los Angeles or San Francisco. So that's all going to be coming up today as well. Believe me, this is a broadcast no one should miss.
[04:47.400 --> 04:52.400]  We're turning the tide against the globalists. We need everybody watching and listening to tell everyone they know right now.
[04:52.400 --> 05:09.400]  Tune in. The revolution is being transmitted worldwide.
[05:22.400 --> 05:34.400]  It's a way to have a self-supporting, self-sustaining, self-structured, little de-democratic structure that because the audience determines what content goes up, the audience determines what audience is ultimately reached by their choices and supporting
[05:34.400 --> 05:52.400]  infowars. And it's all because the audience spends their whatever it is, whether it's $5 or $50 a month on products that they like and that they want that actually compete with the corporate driven model and the ability to do that and at the same time support press, support speech, support letting the audience choose what news they want to see and what views they want to hold.
[05:52.400 --> 06:01.400]  And it's the ultimate American democratic expression and experiment and it is the celebration of free press and free speech with free markets.
[06:01.400 --> 06:25.400]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report. It's Alex Jones.
[06:25.400 --> 06:44.400]  Ladies and gentlemen, you have lived to see it happen. The accelerated collapse of the globalist, their entire house of cards that was sewn and welded and spliced together with their secret currency, the way they compromise people.
[06:44.400 --> 06:55.400]  The old days, 100 years ago, even 80 years ago, 70 years ago, you'd have to set people up cheating on their wives or maybe being gay. That doesn't work anymore for blackmail.
[06:55.400 --> 07:09.400]  So what works? Children. And so the gang initiation into the deep state, both for conservative and liberal politicians from Europe and the United States, is sex with children, children as young as three years old.
[07:09.400 --> 07:19.400]  I was told this by senior Pentagon military officers and former top FBI agents that ran Southern California like Ted Gunderson.
[07:19.400 --> 07:30.400]  And all these years later, it's coming out. Jeffrey Epstein worked with the Clintons, worked with Robert Mueller to set up thousands of people.
[07:30.400 --> 07:43.400]  Sometimes he'd procure over 200 girls in a month, young girls, as young as 10 years old, most about 13, 14, for rich men to have sex with at sex parties.
[07:43.400 --> 07:49.400]  And he'd fly whole planeloads of them out to the Caribbean on his big jet they called the Lolita Express.
[07:49.400 --> 07:53.400]  Bill Clinton flew on it more than 20 times. That's old news.
[07:53.400 --> 08:00.400]  But now we know that he flew a bunch of times without putting his name on it or only putting his initials, which is illegal, violates federal law.
[08:00.400 --> 08:09.400]  Even you're on a private jet now or private plane or your own plane, you've got to give them your social security number or driver's license, who you are, your flight number and where you're going.
[08:09.400 --> 08:16.400]  They didn't do that. They falsified the reports. And the reports on July 4th got released. The judge ordered it the day before.
[08:16.400 --> 08:25.400]  Thanks to Alan Dershowitz, the famous civil rights and defense lawyer, and another great lawyer, doesn't practice law, but a great guy, Mike Cernovich.
[08:25.400 --> 08:37.400]  They were trying to claim that, oh, because Epstein had been let off of the slap on the wrist for all this pedophile pimping that secretly Trump was in there, even though it was under Obama's watch to cover up.
[08:37.400 --> 08:57.400]  So they sued and got the documents and guess what? There's no Trump in here. There's no Alan Dershowitz. There's Bill Clinton and all his buddies and all of these initials, initials of people, which is a violation of federal law.
[08:57.400 --> 09:07.400]  Guess who those people are, the initials? People who didn't want people to know they were on the plane or individuals that were children.
[09:07.400 --> 09:16.400]  Remember the UN report two years ago? Admitting, AP even reported that the UN kidnapped thousands of children. Many died out of the Caribbean.
[09:16.400 --> 09:27.400]  Look at all the child sex trafficking coming in under Obama and even the Senate report admitted, even mainstream news admitted that thousands of children ended up disappearing being sex trafficked.
[09:27.400 --> 09:37.400]  Many killed under the government program to order the board patrol to release them to Democrat charities, who you guessed it, in some cases trafficked in children's organs.
[09:37.400 --> 09:39.400]  Oh, they're not just raping them.
[09:39.400 --> 09:58.400]  And ladies and gentlemen, the full exhibit is in a powerful zero hedge article up on infowars.com. I read this whole thing the last two days and hundreds of pages of other documents that were suppressed in the court agreements that Obama's Justice Department set up.
[09:58.400 --> 10:10.400]  And now it's exonerated people that had been accused falsely, and it's shown who was really up to it. Oh, and who was covering this?
[10:10.400 --> 10:31.400]  Back at the time when Holly decorated top tier, he ran their foreign detail for the Secret Service, agent in charge of operations, Dan Bongino. Dan Bongino a few years ago tweeted out when Hillary was saying, oh, the Secret Service doesn't have any corruption on us.
[10:31.400 --> 10:41.400]  He said back to her handler, be careful, Nick, people know things not yet released publicly about your Messiah Hillary. Don't poke the bear loser because she flew on the plane too.
[10:41.400 --> 10:57.400]  You may not like the results. Hashtag Epstein, hashtag email gate tweeted on Gino. And here is that tweet for you. Now, why is this so huge?
[10:57.400 --> 11:10.400]  Because this implicates Republicans as well, mainly Democrats. And if this unravels, which it is unraveling now, there's no way they can hide it even if they have corrupt Clinton people and Obama people still the Justice Department.
[11:10.400 --> 11:16.400]  As this comes out, there's no way they're going to get away with it because a bunch of people are going to get charged. Epstein's already been arrested again.
[11:16.400 --> 11:27.400]  And there's a total blueprint. Secret Service agents were reportedly disgusted when girls that were clearly 13, 14 years old, who weren't with their parents were brought on and were sitting in men's laps and stuff.
[11:27.400 --> 11:36.400]  So it's admitted, and it's in all the court filings, but was in the news years ago, that the Secret Service, they started not having them on the planes.
[11:36.400 --> 11:42.400]  And that Bill Clinton would ditch his, quote, Secret Service, because the Secret Service wasn't going to put up with it.
[11:42.400 --> 11:47.400]  Obviously, in fact, they should have gone public then, but they did go public.
[11:47.400 --> 11:52.400]  And Bonginos had his house broken into his car. He's been threatened. A lot of folks have been threatened. I've been threatened over this.
[11:52.400 --> 11:59.400]  I've been told I better shut up about what's going on in the Caribbean and everything will stop. All the attacks, all the lawsuits, all the threats.
[11:59.400 --> 12:06.400]  Well, guess what? You failed globalist. I didn't shut up. And Info Wars has been first to be on top of this.
[12:06.400 --> 12:13.400]  That's why they did the whole fake pizza gate thing. Real stuff in the spirit cooking in New York. They diverted off to a pizza place where stuff wasn't going on.
[12:13.400 --> 12:19.400]  Didn't have a basement to get the whole media to cover it. We covered that media coverage. We then got blamed with it falsely.
[12:19.400 --> 12:26.400]  To then say, oh, Hillary's not involved with kids. Oh, she just represented hardcore convicted pedophiles and rapists when she was first a lawyer.
[12:26.400 --> 12:31.400]  That was her specialty. She just continues to be involved in sex trafficking.
[12:31.400 --> 12:40.400]  One of the heads of her foundation is a convicted sex trafficker out of the Caribbean again, who changed her name and now runs Amber Alert.
[12:40.400 --> 12:43.400]  Yes, you can't make this up, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:43.400 --> 12:48.400]  This rabbit hole goes so damn deep. But what this means is Trump's getting control of the Justice Department.
[12:48.400 --> 12:52.400]  Trump is getting some justice out of the courts.
[12:52.400 --> 12:58.400]  And the arrogance of the Clintons tried to threaten Trump with this because he knew Epstein from New York and business and things.
[12:58.400 --> 13:01.400]  Never flew with him. Never was in private stuff with him.
[13:01.400 --> 13:05.400]  The fact that they knew that was their Achilles heel, so they tried to blame it on Trump.
[13:05.400 --> 13:09.400]  Like Russia was Hillary's Achilles heel. Uranium won. So they blame that on Trump.
[13:09.400 --> 13:12.400]  When you've really done it, you blame who is innocent.
[13:12.400 --> 13:19.400]  But it backfired because people sued, the documents got released, and it proves that they are the ones doing this.
[13:19.400 --> 13:26.400]  This is so huge. And it shows that Trump is completely focused and a lot of big things are about to happen.
[13:26.400 --> 13:35.400]  That the gloves are off. And I can tell you from inside information that it's incredibly dangerous to even know that I'm going to release when we come back.
[13:35.400 --> 13:41.400]  That Trump is for real. He's going for broke. And that we are living in incredibly historic times.
[13:41.400 --> 13:48.400]  Speaking of that, we have some major initiatives that I need to launch that will devastate the globalist in a big way.
[13:48.400 --> 13:51.400]  Really exciting things that I'm not at liberty to talk about on air.
[13:51.400 --> 13:56.400]  A lot of behind the scenes things going on that we don't take credit for. I'll just leave it at that.
[13:56.400 --> 14:00.400]  But we are the real defense force for this country and this Republic.
[14:00.400 --> 14:05.400]  You are the support system. You are just as important as I am. Just as important as my crew are.
[14:05.400 --> 14:10.400]  And something very exciting just happened. We know when we have a zeitgeist.
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.400]  We put on sale these Betsy Ross flags, America back shirts.
[14:14.400 --> 14:18.400]  And I said only 4,000 will be printed. We sold half of them in two days.
[14:18.400 --> 14:21.400]  They're all about to sell out. So get the limited editions now.
[14:21.400 --> 14:23.400]  We'll have a new limited edition. It's so popular.
[14:23.400 --> 14:27.400]  But infowarstore.com and it helps fund these initiatives.
[14:27.400 --> 14:30.400]  We need a lot of money and selling these t-shirts is a great way to do it.
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.400]  Plus, it'll trigger these anti-free speech, anti-American Lib Darts. Stay with us. We'll be right back.
[14:37.400 --> 14:40.400]  Folks, we are launching another limited edition right now.
[14:40.400 --> 14:43.400]  T-shirt, we're only going to have 4,000 of these.
[14:43.400 --> 14:47.400]  There's four different variants. Two different shirts in white and in navy blue.
[14:47.400 --> 14:51.400]  I'm very excited about it. It is the Betsy Ross flag.
[14:51.400 --> 14:54.400]  The first flag made by an abolitionist, made by an American.
[14:54.400 --> 14:56.400]  She came with the design. It's a beautiful flag.
[14:56.400 --> 14:59.400]  One of the most recognizable in history and not world history.
[14:59.400 --> 15:03.400]  And it's a white shirt on the front that has the flag in red, white, and blue right across the chest.
[15:03.400 --> 15:07.400]  Big. And then under it says, these colors don't run.
[15:07.400 --> 15:10.400]  On the back, it says America is back.
[15:10.400 --> 15:13.400]  Infowars.com. There's another variant.
[15:13.400 --> 15:17.400]  The Betsy Ross flag established 1776.
[15:17.400 --> 15:20.400]  And on the back, it says America is back. Infowars.com.
[15:20.400 --> 15:23.400]  So two different variants, two different colors. That's four shirts.
[15:23.400 --> 15:26.400]  We're printing a thousand of each.
[15:26.400 --> 15:28.400]  The order was put in yesterday.
[15:28.400 --> 15:31.400]  The place where they make them in America is printing them now.
[15:31.400 --> 15:34.400]  They'll be shipped to us by next week, two weeks for delivery.
[15:34.400 --> 15:40.400]  So get your Betsy Ross Infowars limited edition shirts exclusively at InfowarsStore.com.

[17:04.400 --> 17:06.400]  crossed the continent,
[17:06.400 --> 17:09.400]  harness science, took to the skies,
[17:09.400 --> 17:11.400]  and soared into the heavens.
[17:11.400 --> 17:15.400]  Because we will never forget that we are Americans
[17:15.400 --> 17:19.400]  and the future belongs to us.
[17:23.400 --> 17:28.400]  The future belongs to the brave, the strong, the proud, and the free.
[17:28.400 --> 17:35.400]  We are one people chasing one dream and one magnificent destiny.
[17:35.400 --> 17:41.400]  We all share the same heroes, the same home, the same heart,
[17:41.400 --> 17:46.400]  and we are all made by the same Almighty God.
[17:46.400 --> 17:49.400]  Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[17:49.400 --> 17:52.400]  Full power of the Republic in the name of Jesus Christ.
[17:52.400 --> 17:53.400]  Full power!
[17:53.400 --> 17:59.400]  Damn the torpedoes! Go straight at them!
[17:59.400 --> 18:01.400]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York.
[18:01.400 --> 18:03.400]  Marcus, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[18:03.400 --> 18:06.400]  Hey, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[18:06.400 --> 18:08.400]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City
[18:08.400 --> 18:12.400]  and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.400]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war
[18:16.400 --> 18:19.400]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[18:19.400 --> 18:22.400]  in the eyes of the public, the approaching 2020.
[18:22.400 --> 18:25.400]  I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[18:25.400 --> 18:28.400]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[18:28.400 --> 18:29.400]  It's the time to be praying, my friend.
[18:29.400 --> 18:30.400]  I agree entirely.
[18:30.400 --> 18:33.400]  And the last thing I just want to say, Alex, is I know they're trying to shut you down,
[18:33.400 --> 18:35.400]  but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[18:35.400 --> 18:38.400]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[18:38.400 --> 18:40.400]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80.
[18:40.400 --> 18:43.400]  But if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[18:43.400 --> 18:47.400]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself
[18:47.400 --> 18:49.400]  and many others who are going to continue.
[18:49.400 --> 18:53.400]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War, and even if something does happen to you or your show,
[18:53.400 --> 18:57.400]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[18:57.400 --> 18:59.400]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[19:01.400 --> 19:05.400]  I want to encourage everyone to take advantage of the huge July 4th specials
[19:05.400 --> 19:08.400]  we're running right through into next weekend until they've got to stop.

[19:11.400 --> 19:12.400]  and double-patriot points.
[19:12.400 --> 19:16.400]  That means on your next order, 10% off, not 5% off on the dollar.
[19:16.400 --> 19:19.400]  Designed for auto-shipping, additional 10% off.
[19:19.400 --> 19:21.400]  Some of these products are lost leaders at those prices.
[19:21.400 --> 19:24.400]  X2, learn about why it's so special, how it's the good halogen,
[19:24.400 --> 19:26.400]  how it's the missing link in the body.

[19:28.400 --> 19:31.400]  Rainforest Plus, super blue fluoride-free toothpaste,

[19:33.400 --> 19:35.400]  Turbo Force, the great clean 10-hour energy.

[19:39.400 --> 19:41.400]  the ultimate tumor formula bodies.
[19:41.400 --> 19:45.400]  Most of those are close to selling out, some won't be back in for months,
[19:45.400 --> 19:47.400]  many won't be back in for weeks.
[19:47.400 --> 19:49.400]  But regardless, fish oil for adults, for children.
[19:49.400 --> 19:50.400]  The very best out there.
[19:50.400 --> 19:53.400]  All of these are great products, books, films, t-shirts,
[19:53.400 --> 19:55.400]  water filtration, air filtration.
[19:55.400 --> 19:58.400]  That's what funds the InfoWare and the big sales running right now.
[19:58.400 --> 20:00.400]  InfoWareStore.com.
[20:03.400 --> 20:06.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.400 --> 20:14.400]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[20:14.400 --> 20:17.400]  Right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters
[20:17.400 --> 20:18.400]  in the occupied zone.
[20:18.400 --> 20:20.400]  The chair is against the wall.
[20:20.400 --> 20:22.400]  John has a long mustache.
[20:22.400 --> 20:25.400]  This is the heart of 1776.
[20:25.400 --> 20:28.400]  It's 12 o'clock American, another day closer to victory.
[20:28.400 --> 20:31.400]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines,
[20:31.400 --> 20:33.400]  this is your song.
[20:33.400 --> 20:48.400]  Welcome back to this Sunday, July 7th, 2019, transmission.
[20:48.400 --> 20:50.400]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[20:50.400 --> 20:53.400]  We're going to play an extremely powerful clip from President
[20:53.400 --> 20:55.400]  Trump's July 4th historic speech.
[20:55.400 --> 20:58.400]  He talks about the Second American Revolution is here.
[20:58.400 --> 21:03.400]  1776 worldwide.
[21:03.400 --> 21:09.400]  John Paul Jones have only begun to fight and so much more.
[21:09.400 --> 21:13.400]  Let me break this down as best I can.
[21:13.400 --> 21:19.400]  You're going to get real inside the White House, Intel.
[21:19.400 --> 21:24.400]  Without even trying, in the last four days,
[21:24.400 --> 21:28.400]  I have talked to three people that have personally met with
[21:28.400 --> 21:32.400]  Trump in the last week.
[21:32.400 --> 21:35.400]  Now, I want to be clear.
[21:35.400 --> 21:38.400]  This isn't me up here bragging like the mainstream media does,
[21:38.400 --> 21:41.400]  that, oh, they've got all these White House sources and these leaks
[21:41.400 --> 21:45.400]  that are almost all completely made up and false and garbage.
[21:45.400 --> 21:53.400]  These are real people that Trump trust having real conversations.
[21:53.400 --> 21:57.400]  And that's something the corporate fake media, the fake news,
[21:57.400 --> 21:59.400]  craves is real access.
[21:59.400 --> 22:00.400]  They don't have it.
[22:00.400 --> 22:02.400]  I have access to the Pentagon.
[22:02.400 --> 22:04.400]  I have access to the intelligence agencies.
[22:04.400 --> 22:06.400]  I have access to the Oval Office.
[22:06.400 --> 22:08.400]  And that's why they want me off air.
[22:08.400 --> 22:10.400]  This isn't like I'm up here bragging.
[22:10.400 --> 22:12.400]  This is like being a general on the front lines,
[22:12.400 --> 22:14.400]  dancing around in your full uniform.
[22:14.400 --> 22:21.400]  But it's something I've got to do is walk this tightrope.
[22:21.400 --> 22:24.400]  Because we influence the president.
[22:24.400 --> 22:26.400]  The president influences us.
[22:26.400 --> 22:27.400]  He believes in Americana.
[22:27.400 --> 22:28.400]  He loves Info Wars.
[22:28.400 --> 22:30.400]  He loves our audience.
[22:30.400 --> 22:34.400]  And he keeps his ear to the ground and takes information from Info Wars
[22:34.400 --> 22:37.400]  and really looks at it as from the people.
[22:37.400 --> 22:42.400]  So we're a major populist bullhorn like Tucker Carlson or Sean Hannity.
[22:42.400 --> 22:45.400]  We're one of the only ones out there of probably four or five.
[22:45.400 --> 22:48.400]  And Trump increasingly doesn't care what the New York Times
[22:48.400 --> 22:49.400]  or Washington Post says anymore.
[22:49.400 --> 22:50.400]  He used to care.
[22:50.400 --> 22:53.400]  He understands that it's a true war and that they don't want success
[22:53.400 --> 22:56.400]  and that they really want to stop the country from coming back.
[22:56.400 --> 22:59.400]  Trump totally wants a peace deal with North Korea.
[22:59.400 --> 23:01.400]  He totally wants a good economy.
[23:01.400 --> 23:03.400]  He totally loves everybody.
[23:03.400 --> 23:05.400]  He really wants to deliver.
[23:05.400 --> 23:06.400]  Why wouldn't he?
[23:06.400 --> 23:07.400]  The guy that turned America around?
[23:07.400 --> 23:10.400]  He'd be as great as George Washington.
[23:10.400 --> 23:15.400]  And he now gets just how bad DC is and just how bad the bureaucrats are.
[23:15.400 --> 23:19.400]  And he's really gotten his sea legs under him.
[23:19.400 --> 23:24.400]  And there's just so much to talk about
[23:24.400 --> 23:28.400]  and then so much that I shouldn't talk about.
[23:28.400 --> 23:31.400]  I'll say this, and it's not to get heat off my back.
[23:31.400 --> 23:34.400]  This is to give everybody really good news.
[23:34.400 --> 23:37.400]  We have successfully radicalized the president of the United States.
[23:37.400 --> 23:40.400]  CNN's right when they say it's the Info Wars presidency.
[23:40.400 --> 23:42.400]  We have successfully radicalized the Pentagon.
[23:42.400 --> 23:45.400]  We have successfully radicalized the CIA.
[23:45.400 --> 23:46.400]  I'm not trying to brag.
[23:46.400 --> 23:47.400]  It just happened.
[23:47.400 --> 23:49.400]  We did it. This audience did it.
[23:49.400 --> 23:51.400]  Matt Drudge amplifying other shows.
[23:51.400 --> 23:53.400]  All of you did it.
[23:53.400 --> 23:55.400]  All we did was reboot Americana.
[23:55.400 --> 23:56.400]  Things that make sense.
[23:56.400 --> 23:59.400]  All we did was believe in a good future
[23:59.400 --> 24:03.400]  and believe in promoting free market and family and Second Amendment
[24:03.400 --> 24:06.400]  and Jesus Christ over world government and Hollywood
[24:06.400 --> 24:09.400]  and communism and pedophilia and rich bankers
[24:09.400 --> 24:13.400]  who are above the law and pay no tax but lecturers all day.
[24:13.400 --> 24:18.400]  And Warren Buffett getting $486 billion of bank or bailout
[24:18.400 --> 24:21.400]  but lecturing us that we need to pay more taxes.
[24:21.400 --> 24:23.400]  They have rejected them.
[24:23.400 --> 24:30.400]  And Info Wars has been the star in the crown in that fight by God's grace.
[24:30.400 --> 24:33.400]  But the enemy thinks if they can take me out
[24:33.400 --> 24:37.400]  that somehow that will shut down what's happened.
[24:37.400 --> 24:38.400]  It's a chain reaction.
[24:38.400 --> 24:39.400]  You can't stop it.
[24:39.400 --> 24:40.400]  And I'm not just saying that.
[24:40.400 --> 24:42.400]  I don't just say things and hope they're true.
[24:42.400 --> 24:43.400]  You're done.
[24:43.400 --> 24:44.400]  You're screwed.
[24:44.400 --> 24:45.400]  It's over.
[24:45.400 --> 24:46.400]  You may be able to take us out.
[24:46.400 --> 24:48.400]  You may be able to hold on for a while.
[24:48.400 --> 24:50.400]  But you're never going to win.
[24:50.400 --> 24:51.400]  It's over.
[24:51.400 --> 24:52.400]  No amount of AI.
[24:52.400 --> 24:53.400]  No amount of censorship.
[24:53.400 --> 24:54.400]  You're done.
[24:54.400 --> 24:57.400]  Definitely this crop of control freaks the Clintons and the Pelosi's
[24:57.400 --> 25:01.400]  and they're all eating their own and Biden and Obama and all.
[25:01.400 --> 25:04.400]  And all the EU lackeys and all of you criminals
[25:04.400 --> 25:08.400]  that try to set up a world government you run at our expense.
[25:08.400 --> 25:11.400]  We do the hanging, not you.
[25:11.400 --> 25:14.400]  And so we successfully raise the alarm
[25:14.400 --> 25:15.400]  and your goose is cooked.
[25:15.400 --> 25:18.400]  And so I'm still going to fight really hard
[25:18.400 --> 25:20.400]  and infowars is important.
[25:20.400 --> 25:22.400]  But the public gets the paradigm.
[25:22.400 --> 25:24.400]  Because when I say I radicalized the president,
[25:24.400 --> 25:25.400]  it was already there.
[25:25.400 --> 25:27.400]  We just triggered it.
[25:27.400 --> 25:30.400]  And the enemy attacking Trump proved everything we said.
[25:30.400 --> 25:32.400]  And the global is coming out and say they hate America.
[25:32.400 --> 25:35.400]  And we have a race war and the pedophilia is good.
[25:35.400 --> 25:37.400]  It's real.
[25:37.400 --> 25:39.400]  And so we told everybody how they were.
[25:39.400 --> 25:40.400]  It came true.
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.400]  They showed themselves.
[25:41.400 --> 25:44.400]  They unmasked trying to scare everybody.
[25:44.400 --> 25:46.400]  See, they thought we were scared.
[25:46.400 --> 25:48.400]  No, we were asleep.
[25:48.400 --> 25:51.400]  And you're now trying to terrorize this only pissed us off.
[25:51.400 --> 25:53.400]  So here's the good news.
[25:53.400 --> 25:56.400]  The public's awake and you can kill me tomorrow.
[25:56.400 --> 25:57.400]  Nobody's shutting up.
[25:57.400 --> 25:59.400]  Nobody's going away.
[25:59.400 --> 26:00.400]  People have your number.
[26:00.400 --> 26:02.400]  They've got your blueprints.
[26:02.400 --> 26:03.400]  They've got how you work.
[26:03.400 --> 26:04.400]  They've got how you operate.
[26:04.400 --> 26:05.400]  And it's over.
[26:05.400 --> 26:06.400]  It's over.
[26:06.400 --> 26:08.400]  Now, it's going to be a rough process,
[26:08.400 --> 26:10.400]  but you're broken up.
[26:10.400 --> 26:11.400]  Your back is broken.
[26:11.400 --> 26:13.400]  We're going to go to this powerful clip of the president.
[26:13.400 --> 26:15.400]  We'll come back with more of this because this is so central.
[26:15.400 --> 26:17.400]  And then all the tectonic things that are happening.
[26:17.400 --> 26:18.400]  And so much more.
[26:18.400 --> 26:20.400]  I'm Alex Jones in FullWars.com.
[26:20.400 --> 26:21.400]  NewsWars.com.
[26:21.400 --> 26:24.400]  Tomorrow's news today.
[26:24.400 --> 26:29.400]  Thomas Jefferson wrote the words that forever changed the course of humanity.
[26:29.400 --> 26:34.400]  We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal.
[26:34.400 --> 26:39.400]  That they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
[26:39.400 --> 26:50.400]  That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[26:50.400 --> 26:55.400]  With a single sheet of parchment and 56 signatures,
[26:55.400 --> 26:59.400]  America began the greatest political journey in human history.
[26:59.400 --> 27:05.400]  But on that day, the patriots who would determine the ultimate success of the struggle
[27:05.400 --> 27:08.400]  were 100 miles away in New York.
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.400]  There, the Continental Army prepared to make it stand,
[27:12.400 --> 27:24.400]  commanded by the beloved General George Washington.
[27:24.400 --> 27:29.400]  As the delegates debated the declaration in Philadelphia,
[27:29.400 --> 27:34.400]  Washington's Army watched from Manhattan as a massive British invading fleet
[27:34.400 --> 27:37.400]  loomed dangerously across New York Harbor.
[27:37.400 --> 27:42.400]  The British had come to crush the revolution in its infancy.
[27:42.400 --> 27:46.400]  Washington's message to his troops laid bare the stakes.
[27:46.400 --> 27:55.400]  He wrote, the fate of unborn millions will now depend under God on the courage and conduct of this army.
[27:55.400 --> 28:09.400]  We have therefore to resolve, to conquer, or die.
[28:09.400 --> 28:16.400]  Days later, General Washington ordered the declaration read aloud to the troops.
[28:16.400 --> 28:22.400]  The assembled soldiers just joined, an excited crowd running down Broadway.
[28:22.400 --> 28:27.400]  They toppled a statue of King George and melted it into bullets for battle.
[28:27.400 --> 28:34.400]  The faraway king would soon learn a timeless lesson about the people of this majestic land.
[28:34.400 --> 28:41.400]  Americans love our freedom and no one will ever take it away from us.
[28:41.400 --> 28:46.400]  The National Liberation Army
[28:46.400 --> 28:51.400]  The National Liberation Army
[28:51.400 --> 28:56.400]  The National Liberation Army
[28:56.400 --> 29:00.400]  The National Liberation Army
[29:00.400 --> 29:03.400]  I talk about this on the air, and I know it sinks into people,
[29:03.400 --> 29:06.400]  but I decided that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements
[29:06.400 --> 29:09.400]  and that if you go back five, six years ago, before all the censorship and attacks
[29:09.400 --> 29:12.400]  and fake lawsuits and the rest of it, I would talk about how great the products are
[29:12.400 --> 29:14.400]  and how they were the best and why they were,
[29:14.400 --> 29:17.400]  and I'd have doctors on and experts to explain why they were so good.
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.400]  And instead, the last few years, I'm like, hey, we need to really support us,
[29:20.400 --> 29:22.400]  or they'll shut us down, the biggest thing people like to buy is supplements,
[29:22.400 --> 29:24.400]  because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were.
[29:24.400 --> 29:26.400]  And the left always has headlines everywhere.
[29:26.400 --> 29:30.400]  Jones sells unapproved supplements, and he claims they're supplements.
[29:30.400 --> 29:36.400]  No, under federal law since 1996, you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA
[29:36.400 --> 29:38.400]  because they have no jurisdiction and won't look at it.
[29:38.400 --> 29:41.400]  But then they say you've got to say it's not approved by them,
[29:41.400 --> 29:44.400]  and all drugs are, is the system trying to tweak what's in Mother Nature
[29:44.400 --> 29:47.400]  and manipulate it and do different things, and a lot of drugs work great.
[29:47.400 --> 29:49.400]  They have side effects, not with Mother Nature,
[29:49.400 --> 29:53.400]  but Big Pharma doesn't want you knowing about God's medicine chest.
[29:53.400 --> 29:58.400]  InfowarsStore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[30:01.400 --> 30:05.400]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[30:05.400 --> 30:08.400]  Viewers and listeners, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you,
[30:08.400 --> 30:11.400]  and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as you've seen,
[30:11.400 --> 30:15.400]  but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my heart
[30:15.400 --> 30:19.400]  to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against us last week,
[30:19.400 --> 30:22.400]  the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were liars,
[30:22.400 --> 30:24.400]  you went and looked it up and found out the truth.
[30:24.400 --> 30:27.400]  And so I feel very strong, and I feel God's hand on my shoulder,
[30:27.400 --> 30:31.400]  and I feel your love in my heart, and I want you to know that love is right back at you,
[30:31.400 --> 30:35.400]  and I want to thank you for all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers
[30:35.400 --> 30:38.400]  and your financial support, because I'm committed to fight to the end,
[30:38.400 --> 30:41.400]  but I want to win, and without you, I'm going to be destroyed,
[30:41.400 --> 30:44.400]  and it's not going to be fun, but that's not what's important.
[30:44.400 --> 30:47.400]  The enemy could win. We're a key chess piece in this fight.
[30:47.400 --> 30:50.400]  We're being used by God. You're being used by God.
[30:50.400 --> 30:52.400]  This is Providence, so I salute you,
[30:52.400 --> 30:55.400]  and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart.
[30:55.400 --> 31:01.400]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[31:01.400 --> 31:03.400]  The time has come. The time is here.
[31:03.400 --> 31:07.400]  The globalists are openly activating their anti-American forces to demonize
[31:07.400 --> 31:10.400]  the American people, the very existence of our borders,
[31:10.400 --> 31:13.400]  and that the whole world could come here and get everything free,
[31:13.400 --> 31:15.400]  but that we, the citizens, have to pay for it.
[31:15.400 --> 31:17.400]  When our nation is on the verge of bankruptcy,
[31:17.400 --> 31:20.400]  if we don't have major innovation and major booms,
[31:20.400 --> 31:22.400]  we will collapse into third world status,
[31:22.400 --> 31:26.400]  and the UN and others admit they're using giant migrant waves
[31:26.400 --> 31:29.400]  in Europe and the U.S. to collapse the countries,
[31:29.400 --> 31:32.400]  to kill capitalism, and bring in socialism
[31:32.400 --> 31:35.400]  so we can go the way of the old Soviet Union, North Korea, and Venezuela.
[31:35.400 --> 31:37.400]  This is a plan. That's why we've got to stay on air.
[31:37.400 --> 31:40.400]  It's why you've got to keep fighting, because we're going to win this in the end.
[31:40.400 --> 31:43.400]  Thanks to you and your support. That's what makes it all possible,
[31:43.400 --> 31:45.400]  so I salute you, and I thank you, but I ask you again,
[31:45.400 --> 31:49.400]  do your shopping with us, and we will continue on in the face of this.
[31:49.400 --> 31:52.400]  For more, store.com, 50% off, store-line free shipping,
[31:52.400 --> 31:55.400]  double-patriot points, whatever you do, commit now to history,
[31:55.400 --> 31:58.400]  and know that buying products from us is one of the most important things
[31:58.400 --> 32:00.400]  you can do in the fight against the globalist.
[32:00.400 --> 32:03.400]  Let's talk to Marcus in New York. Marcus here on the air. Thanks for holding.
[32:03.400 --> 32:06.400]  Hey, Eric. Yeah, I just want to say, your show is a breath of fresh air.
[32:06.400 --> 32:08.400]  I talk to a lot of people here out in New York City,
[32:08.400 --> 32:12.400]  and one thing I can tell you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars.
[32:12.400 --> 32:16.400]  I think that the Neocons are trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war
[32:16.400 --> 32:19.400]  because they know that that's the only way that they could defeat him
[32:19.400 --> 32:22.400]  in the eyes of the public approaching 2020.
[32:22.400 --> 32:25.400]  That's it. I mean, if Trump buys into this, it'll be the end of his presidency.
[32:25.400 --> 32:28.400]  It's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him.
[32:28.400 --> 32:29.400]  It's a time to be praying, my friend.
[32:29.400 --> 32:31.400]  I agree entirely, and the last thing I just want to say, Alex,
[32:31.400 --> 32:35.400]  is I know they're trying to shut you down, but the reinforcements have arrived, man.
[32:35.400 --> 32:38.400]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old.
[32:38.400 --> 32:40.400]  I would love to see what you're talking about when you're 80,
[32:40.400 --> 32:43.400]  but if they do shut you down, no, you've gone into this war.
[32:43.400 --> 32:47.400]  You've won a lot of battles, and there are a lot of people like myself
[32:47.400 --> 32:49.400]  and many others who are going to continue.
[32:49.400 --> 32:51.400]  We're going to keep fighting in the Info War,
[32:51.400 --> 32:53.400]  and even if something does happen to you or your show,
[32:53.400 --> 32:57.400]  know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty.
[32:57.400 --> 32:59.400]  Thank you, sir, for calling.
[32:59.400 --> 33:10.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:18.400 --> 33:24.400]  So let me quantify what I got into last segment, because this is so central.
[33:24.400 --> 33:27.400]  ABC News, CBS, CNN, all of them.
[33:27.400 --> 33:33.400]  They desired above all else to have access to Trump,
[33:33.400 --> 33:35.400]  because you see, Trump's actually the president.
[33:35.400 --> 33:39.400]  He's actually calling the shots.
[33:39.400 --> 33:41.400]  If they could co-opt him, they'd be happy,
[33:41.400 --> 33:44.400]  but they are totally freaked out because of bureaucracy,
[33:44.400 --> 33:51.400]  and these roundtables like the CFR would come up with a consensus,
[33:51.400 --> 33:53.400]  and then all of those people that were in those roundtables
[33:53.400 --> 33:56.400]  would make hundreds of millions of dollars a year,
[33:56.400 --> 34:00.400]  a piece in some cases, billions a year in some,
[34:00.400 --> 34:03.400]  off a parlaying all of that access.
[34:03.400 --> 34:09.400]  Well, along comes the Second American Revolution that Trump talked about earlier,
[34:09.400 --> 34:13.400]  and what are they going to do?
[34:13.400 --> 34:16.400]  Well, they're going to try to reach into everybody in his orbit.
[34:16.400 --> 34:18.400]  They're going to try to get their operatives into place.
[34:18.400 --> 34:22.400]  They're going to try to threaten everybody in his orbit to join them or be destroyed.
[34:22.400 --> 34:27.400]  They're going to use their NSA access that all these Democrats from Obama and Hillary era
[34:27.400 --> 34:33.400]  and the Clinton era and the Bush era are still in place,
[34:33.400 --> 34:36.400]  and so they're going to use their national security clearances,
[34:36.400 --> 34:39.400]  Clapper and Brennan and Mudd and all the rest of them,
[34:39.400 --> 34:44.400]  to run around wreaking havoc trying to block Trump's agenda.
[34:44.400 --> 34:46.400]  And then along comes Info Wars.
[34:46.400 --> 34:48.400]  Along comes people on the street.
[34:48.400 --> 34:51.400]  Along comes folks calling into the White House,
[34:51.400 --> 34:55.400]  and the President is up late at night just answering the switchboard to see many nights
[34:55.400 --> 34:57.400]  what you think and what you're saying.
[34:57.400 --> 35:00.400]  It's incredible.
[35:00.400 --> 35:03.400]  They want to cut that access off.
[35:03.400 --> 35:08.400]  And so what I announced earlier was they failed cutting the access off.
[35:08.400 --> 35:09.400]  They failed miserably.
[35:09.400 --> 35:16.400]  When they told Trump, when John Kelly and others told Trump
[35:16.400 --> 35:21.400]  that he couldn't read Info Wars or he couldn't watch my show
[35:21.400 --> 35:24.400]  or he couldn't see clips of it that people were bringing him from a security detail
[35:24.400 --> 35:26.400]  and so many others,
[35:26.400 --> 35:29.400]  that made Trump only seek that out even more
[35:29.400 --> 35:35.400]  and then that accelerated the process of Trump becoming quote radicalized.
[35:35.400 --> 35:37.400]  And to be clear, the globalists are radicals.
[35:37.400 --> 35:39.400]  They want open borders, world government.
[35:39.400 --> 35:41.400]  They want to break up the family.
[35:41.400 --> 35:44.400]  They want a technocracy, a worldwide police state,
[35:44.400 --> 35:47.400]  Islamic invasions, all of this.
[35:47.400 --> 35:51.400]  And you can only defeat something that radical by admitting it's radical
[35:51.400 --> 35:54.400]  and taking radical measures against it.
[35:54.400 --> 35:58.400]  If your leg has gangrene and your whole body is going to die, you cut it off.
[35:58.400 --> 36:00.400]  If you got cancer that's going to kill you,
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.400]  it's going to hurt to have a surgery, but you get it out.
[36:04.400 --> 36:09.400]  And so that's what's happening here is that they proved they were the baddies
[36:09.400 --> 36:11.400]  and they proved it to everybody.
[36:11.400 --> 36:13.400]  And they're fake polls.
[36:13.400 --> 36:15.400]  That's out in the news. I'll cover it next segment.
[36:15.400 --> 36:18.400]  ABC hides Trump approval surge with voters.
[36:18.400 --> 36:22.400]  Says he's in trouble.
[36:22.400 --> 36:25.400]  But all the real internal polls show he's way up 15 points.
[36:25.400 --> 36:27.400]  And the president gets that.
[36:27.400 --> 36:30.400]  Remember how all the polls were wrong in 2016?
[36:30.400 --> 36:36.400]  Because they were paid to lie to over sample 15 points on average Democrats.
[36:36.400 --> 36:39.400]  But Democrats have nobody at their events.
[36:39.400 --> 36:41.400]  No crowds showing up.
[36:41.400 --> 36:47.400]  20 people to protest Trump on the fourth of July versus hundreds of thousands to celebrate.
[36:47.400 --> 36:50.400]  They are failing and they're in their death rows and they're panicking.
[36:50.400 --> 36:55.400]  So they're trying to sink the country as their only hope.
[36:55.400 --> 37:00.400]  And so by them persecuting in force, by them censoring us,
[37:00.400 --> 37:06.400]  in some ways we're unable to reach larger audiences and new audiences on Facebook
[37:06.400 --> 37:09.400]  and Twitter and YouTube and places and Google's elicitous.
[37:09.400 --> 37:12.400]  But it doesn't matter because the people that count,
[37:12.400 --> 37:17.400]  really smart folks that are in government, in corporations, in academia, in banking,
[37:17.400 --> 37:24.400]  they now know that everything we ever talked about was super dead on in the main,
[37:24.400 --> 37:29.400]  in the general, and they are now going off of it as a blueprint.
[37:29.400 --> 37:34.400]  When all our research was human history, American history, freedom versus tyranny,
[37:34.400 --> 37:37.400]  and I believed in you and I believed we could have a renaissance reboot.
[37:37.400 --> 37:45.400]  And guess what? You are coming into my store and you're buying into that because you know
[37:45.400 --> 37:48.400]  it's something you already bought into when you were born.
[37:48.400 --> 37:51.400]  It's who you already are and I bought into who you are.
[37:51.400 --> 37:58.400]  We're buying into success and a future and freedom together and that angers the globalists so much.
[37:58.400 --> 38:06.400]  Just the access that people crave, that corrupt lawyer that went to jail for his own crimes,
[38:06.400 --> 38:15.400]  nothing to do with Trump, he was getting tens of millions of dollars apiece from big corporations
[38:15.400 --> 38:19.400]  just in the hope that he would influence Trump.
[38:19.400 --> 38:22.400]  Michael Cohen, that's going on everywhere.
[38:22.400 --> 38:29.400]  Trump has banned the lobbyist but still then anybody that gets to talk to Trump is seen as a lobbyist
[38:29.400 --> 38:32.400]  and that drives the globalist crazy.
[38:32.400 --> 38:36.400]  It's like you're getting to talk to the queen of the prom or something and these are all social climbers
[38:36.400 --> 38:41.400]  that are obsessed with status and obsessed with the cocktail parties and the in-groups.
[38:41.400 --> 38:47.400]  Can you imagine what it's like for Brian Stelter and Alden to go to hear Trump word for word repeating
[38:47.400 --> 38:54.400]  days later what I've said? Do you know how that infuriates them and how that drives them crazy?
[38:54.400 --> 38:59.400]  And that's why they're suing us and trying to shut us down and attacking us, but here's the good news.
[38:59.400 --> 39:02.400]  People aren't even plagiarizing what I've said.
[39:02.400 --> 39:05.400]  They're seeing what I already saw and what you see.
[39:05.400 --> 39:09.400]  We're all experiencing it and now there's the great awakening.
[39:09.400 --> 39:16.400]  The blinders are being taken away and we're all seeing it and that's the radicalization of reality.
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.400]  It's that people now know the globalist paradigm, they know the globalist plan,
[39:20.400 --> 39:24.400]  and then once you know the plan and how it works you see all their operations
[39:24.400 --> 39:29.400]  and you see where they're bragging in their own elite publications to each other how they're doing it.
[39:29.400 --> 39:32.400]  They were so arrogant they've admitted it all.
[39:32.400 --> 39:36.400]  And all we've got to do is then research what they're doing, realize it's bad for everybody,
[39:36.400 --> 39:39.400]  it's illegal and say no to the damn thing.
[39:39.400 --> 39:44.400]  But they thought in a giant confidence act, a confidence game like tyrants have done throughout history
[39:44.400 --> 39:48.400]  that they could go further and further and further, but they went too far.
[39:48.400 --> 39:51.400]  They're not history's actors. Remember Carl Rove?
[39:51.400 --> 39:57.400]  There was a cocktail party, CNN, ABC News, New York Times was there, and they said to Carl Rove.
[39:57.400 --> 40:01.400]  They said, hey, you said there were WMDs, now you say there weren't.
[40:01.400 --> 40:04.400]  People remember you lied and he said, I control reality.
[40:04.400 --> 40:08.400]  And I'll tell you what's new reality next week, it may be totally different and you'll go dutifully report it
[40:08.400 --> 40:11.400]  because we are history's actors now.
[40:11.400 --> 40:13.400]  This is the end of history, the public doesn't matter.
[40:13.400 --> 40:18.400]  Well, guess what? You're hated, you're reviled, Rove, everybody knows you're a liar, you have no credibility.
[40:18.400 --> 40:21.400]  That's the same thing for all these delusional scum.
[40:21.400 --> 40:27.400]  And here's a powerful piece with attorney Barnes talking about Trump's speech in a two-minute summation
[40:27.400 --> 40:30.400]  and then we'll be back from break. History's happening, stay with us.
[40:30.400 --> 40:38.400]  Robert Barnes, what does Big Tech become?
[40:38.400 --> 40:43.400]  Big Tech are big babies that have become big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence
[40:43.400 --> 40:47.400]  social, economic, political or legal for their illicit activities over two decades.
[40:47.400 --> 40:52.400]  And because of that, that's why the courts, the judges, the juries, the public officials that care about this,
[40:52.400 --> 40:56.400]  the members of the independent free press that care about this, the ordinary members of the public and the audience
[40:56.400 --> 41:01.400]  that care about this have to bring real social, political, economic consequence to their course of conduct
[41:01.400 --> 41:06.400]  otherwise they will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs equivalent to the big trust of the 19th century
[41:06.400 --> 41:12.400]  who ran American politics and ran American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after the Great Depression.
[41:12.400 --> 41:14.400]  And let's be absolutely crystal clear here.
[41:14.400 --> 41:20.400]  Big railroads and big steel and big oil had Pickerton's security killed thousands, were horribly corrupt,
[41:20.400 --> 41:24.400]  gouged small-time farmers, ran all sorts of scams, but they weren't reading all your mail.
[41:24.400 --> 41:31.400]  They didn't know what bra size your wife wears or what size tampons and what you like to watch porn-wise.
[41:31.400 --> 41:35.400]  They didn't know what was in your bank account. They didn't know what God you worship or don't worship.
[41:35.400 --> 41:43.400]  This is omnipresent level abuse and coupled with the monopolies, it is the ultimate Mark of the Beast-style nightmare system.
[41:43.400 --> 41:50.400]  And remember, M4 Wars was the vanguard of being banned first, the most banned, and at the vanguard of fighting it
[41:50.400 --> 41:56.400]  because we are the vanguard. You are the vanguard. Step into the history, folks.
[41:56.400 --> 42:01.400]  The Info Wars audience is the fuel that flames the light of liberty across the world.
[42:01.400 --> 42:06.400]  And that's the reason why, because it created this little d-democratic experiment in independent free press,
[42:06.400 --> 42:11.400]  independent free speech of the ordinary Americans coming together collectively and aggregately
[42:11.400 --> 42:15.400]  with their financial support of Info Wars to make real the original promise of an independent free press,
[42:15.400 --> 42:21.400]  to make real the actions of independent free speech in our electoral arena, in our social and cultural influential arena.
[42:21.400 --> 42:26.400]  That shapes people's minds, shape people's thoughts to where you can choose your own news and your own views
[42:26.400 --> 42:34.400]  and share and spread those with the rest of the world. That is why it was the target for a totalitarian, authoritarian, control-oriented, big tech, big media...
[42:34.400 --> 42:36.400]  They used our openness as our weakness.
[42:36.400 --> 42:42.400]  Precisely. And it's real collusion. Real collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[42:42.400 --> 42:45.400]  to try to aim metal with elections, to try to shape people's thoughts.
[42:45.400 --> 42:48.400]  And then the whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening.
[42:48.400 --> 42:51.400]  It's the ultimate form of gaslighting. What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[42:51.400 --> 43:13.400]  Even it is what you just saw.
[43:21.400 --> 43:50.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[43:50.400 --> 43:59.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[44:20.400 --> 44:48.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[44:48.400 --> 44:58.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[45:18.400 --> 45:38.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[45:38.400 --> 45:58.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[45:58.400 --> 46:27.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[46:27.400 --> 46:55.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[46:55.400 --> 47:02.400]  What you just saw isn't what you just saw.
[47:02.400 --> 47:10.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:10.400 --> 47:26.400]  Preview.
[47:26.400 --> 47:28.400]  Final round.
[47:28.400 --> 47:46.400]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.400]  I told you that I'd give you some of the real secrets of the White House.
[47:50.400 --> 47:55.400]  And I already have. I've explained how it works, what makes Trump tick, the fact that he's really for real.
[47:55.400 --> 48:00.400]  But I want to just lay out some of the things I've learned from people very close to the president
[48:00.400 --> 48:06.400]  that CNN and the New York Times would kill to get.
[48:06.400 --> 48:15.400]  Trump is planning on taking action against big tech in the next few months for the censorship for the election meddling.
[48:15.400 --> 48:20.400]  And he always goes through the process of meeting with big tech first, meeting with whoever he's upset with first,
[48:20.400 --> 48:26.400]  giving them a chance, watching, seeing what they do, seeing if they fulfill agreements and promises.
[48:26.400 --> 48:33.400]  Instead, they just lie to him. And then he has more meetings with them to warn him again.
[48:33.400 --> 48:41.400]  And then he meets with the opposition and he meets with the people that have been persecuted to develop a battle plan.
[48:41.400 --> 48:52.400]  That's why, next Thursday, we'll be covering it live, social media icons like Carpe Dongtum and many others that I've talked to
[48:52.400 --> 48:57.400]  and have reached out to me that do not wish to be known until they're there, for a lot of obvious reasons.
[48:57.400 --> 49:00.400]  He had targeted by the media for this. They hate the access.
[49:00.400 --> 49:07.400]  They're going to be meeting with Trump and then having breakaway events and meetings after that.
[49:07.400 --> 49:21.400]  And some of this, I'm not at liberty to get into, but Trump is talking to the best minds from the grassroots up with his chief of staff for the campaign, Brad Parcells.
[49:21.400 --> 49:31.400]  And Trump is formulating an action plan and he's tired of his lawyers and people at the Justice Department who he said go after him for antitrust,
[49:31.400 --> 49:34.400]  go after him for election meddling, not taking action.
[49:34.400 --> 49:46.400]  And so he's developing a whole range of systems from cutting federal funding to any of these groups, any advertising, to not letting US military bases visit these sites.
[49:46.400 --> 49:55.400]  They've been compromised by the Chinese in the case of Apple and Google, that's on record, just like Huawei, to promoting new platforms,
[49:55.400 --> 50:00.400]  which they've already been beta testing like Parler and some others.
[50:00.400 --> 50:09.400]  So these folks are all going to be there. Hundreds of people are going to be there. Not so much journalists, but I'll just leave it at that.
[50:09.400 --> 50:31.400]  I've got some folks there, obviously.
[50:39.400 --> 51:05.400]  I'll just leave it at that.
[51:05.400 --> 51:15.400]  So these folks are all going to be there. Hundreds of people are going to be there. Not so much journalist, but I'll just leave it at that.
[51:15.400 --> 51:22.400]  I've got some folks that are obviously going to be there representing us, but I'll let the media try to figure out who.
[51:22.400 --> 51:30.400]  But I have talked to about 10 of the people that are going to be there have reached out to me or have reached out to them.
[51:30.400 --> 51:39.400]  I haven't talked to Ben Garrison yet, who they're now trying to call an anti-Semite for saying Soros is a puppet master over people in the White House.
[51:39.400 --> 51:45.400]  It turned out his former head of global initiatives was the lady they put in Trump's administration to do all the hiring.
[51:45.400 --> 51:52.400]  We exposed that first with stone. And then Cernovich commissioned a deal they're calling anti-Semitic. That's how they operate.
[51:52.400 --> 52:03.400]  Tomorrow I'm going to have Carpe Dantamon to talk more about this. And Tommy Robinson is going to issue a huge announcement, his biggest announcement ever,
[52:03.400 --> 52:11.400]  exclusively on the broadcast tomorrow. He was on exclusively Friday. He's facing more present time and solitary confinement for the crime of journalism.
[52:11.400 --> 52:17.400]  They're calling that contempt of court. It's incredible. He's going to have an emergency message tomorrow.
[52:17.400 --> 52:27.400]  I'll just say it to Trump and others. He's facing death. He says he's ready to die, but he's going to make a very bold move tomorrow on the broadcast.
[52:27.400 --> 52:33.400]  We'll have a lot more of the inside baseball on what's happening at the White House, what's happening to fight against globalism,
[52:33.400 --> 52:39.400]  what's happening with people being persecuted for what they do in the media and the press, and for being patriots.
[52:39.400 --> 52:44.400]  But the bottom line is this. The globalists are losing control, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:44.400 --> 52:52.400]  The globalists have lost the narrative. The people hate them. None of their lies, none of their tricks work anymore, so they double down and do even bigger lies.
[52:52.400 --> 52:58.400]  Like people are drinking out of toilets, AOC, and there was nobody at Trump's rally and show it five hours before it started.
[52:58.400 --> 53:07.400]  And people now know, wow, you really lie. You don't just lie some. You don't just spin. You are out of control, and so we're winning.
[53:07.400 --> 53:10.400]  It's a dangerous time. The globalists are going to pull a lot of stuff, but we're winning.
[53:10.400 --> 53:15.400]  Here's a clip from Friday's interview with Tommy Robinson, very, very powerful, very, very scary.
[53:15.400 --> 53:21.400]  And then the second hour is coming up on the earthquake threat, 125 times stronger and so much more.
[53:21.400 --> 53:26.400]  Second hour straight ahead, whatever you do, tell everyone you know, infowars.com, forward slash show. Stay with us.
[53:26.400 --> 53:37.400]  Here's Tommy Robinson. When freedom fails, the best men rot in filthy jails, and those that cry to peas-a-peas are hung by those they tried to please.
[53:37.400 --> 53:43.400]  Tommy Robinson, we didn't talk much before you went live on air. I don't know the answer to this. You usually know the answer.
[53:43.400 --> 53:50.400]  What's the best bet on what's going to happen to you, my friend, next week? Tell us what the sentencing is and tell us what you think you're facing.
[53:50.400 --> 53:57.400]  I think I'm going to jail. The best bet I've got now is to launch another appeal.
[53:57.400 --> 54:09.400]  Again, Alex, £115,000 was spent firing this case. This is what a lot of it comes to. So now if I lodge an appeal, it's another £30,000 minimum.
[54:09.400 --> 54:19.400]  So if not, they're eating you up. So if I lodge an appeal, if I get sent to jail next Thursday, then I can apply for bail to get out of jail whilst I await my appeal.
[54:19.400 --> 54:21.400]  But what is showing me...
[54:21.400 --> 54:26.400]  No, they eat you up like cancer. Same things happening to us. They're suing Owen as well. Keep going.
[54:26.400 --> 54:33.400]  It's showing me that they don't care. They don't care that the world's watching. They don't care that they haven't followed their own laws.
[54:33.400 --> 54:42.400]  They do not care. They are changing. You know, Alex, I was charged. Originally, they told the whole world that I prejudice the trial and I risk-capsule.
[54:42.400 --> 54:49.400]  When two separate judges went for, said, actually, no, he didn't. There's nothing he says that does that. That case then gets dropped.
[54:49.400 --> 54:57.400]  I then get out. I'm out. I'm released from prison for what they call an unlawful and a flawed process within the court.
[54:57.400 --> 55:13.400]  Then, for five months, the Attorney General sits on this. I produce a documentary, Panadrama. Panadrama completely exposes the corruption of the BBC working alongside far-left George Soros organisations to frame me for sexual allegations.
[55:13.400 --> 55:16.400]  We have undercover footage of it. The biggest expose on the BBC is...
[55:16.400 --> 55:25.400]  Oh, let's explain. You've got millions of views in one day. YouTube banned it. We aired it. Tell folks the name of it. It's on your site so people can find it.
[55:25.400 --> 55:34.400]  Where they're undercover video admitting, just set him up, say he raped you, say he assaulted you, and they go, well, but that's not true. This is what they do.
[55:34.400 --> 55:43.400]  This is, and it's called Panadrama. So Panadrama is the BBC flagship show. We called ours Panadrama. We had their lead investigator, their face of Panadrama on camera,
[55:43.400 --> 55:51.400]  setting me up, blatantly setting me up. The biggest expose on the BBC in this country has ever seen, and not one single British journalist talked about it.
[55:51.400 --> 55:58.400]  I was removed from Facebook, removed from YouTube, all within 24 hours. I was completely de-platformed from everywhere within 24 hours.
[55:58.400 --> 56:10.400]  And five days later, the Attorney General ordered me to be prosecuted on these charges. These charges, which they've created because they're completely separate charges to the charges I was originally put in jail for when they first put me in jail,
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.400]  they added two new charges of causing anxiety to the Muslim people.
[56:15.400 --> 56:25.400]  So this is the whole leftist system of you hurt my feelings. Therefore, the Magna Carta 1215 means nothing. So pulling back Big Picture, you've had tens of thousands in the streets for you.
[56:25.400 --> 56:36.400]  You've basically relaunched a whole new yellow vest movement in the UK. What is the, and you're not threatening anything, but what is your concern of if you do go to prison,
[56:36.400 --> 56:43.400]  or they do hurt you again, or they do throw acid in your face again, or they do try to stab you again, or God forbid they do kill you.
[56:43.400 --> 56:46.400]  What could this set off for these arrogant tyrants?
[56:46.400 --> 56:57.400]  This is the thing, like I'm feeling sorry for myself, which I need to slap out of and snap out of, but at the same time, as far as my cause causes, as far as our cause,
[56:57.400 --> 57:06.400]  send me a jail and kill me in prison and watch the country go.
[57:06.400 --> 57:14.400]  So essentially, I know that's a stupid thing to say, but essentially I've always said it, this country needs a revolution.
[57:14.400 --> 57:23.400]  Put me in jail, have me killed if you stupid morons think that's going to not do it, and I only wish that I'd be here to watch the country rise,
[57:23.400 --> 57:30.400]  because it's going to take a moment, I've always said it's going to take something, they have no idea what they're doing.
[57:30.400 --> 57:35.400]  So essentially for the cause, please, the best thing you could have done is find me guilty, I know of free charges,
[57:35.400 --> 57:42.400]  the best thing you can do for my cause, and our country's cause, and our people's cause, and the uprising of people against your totalitarianism,
[57:42.400 --> 57:46.400]  the best thing you could do is find me guilty, the best thing you can do is slam me with a prison sentence,
[57:46.400 --> 57:53.400]  the last thing I'm going to do is beg you and ask.
[58:16.400 --> 58:29.400]  As long as we remember our great history, as long as we never ever stop fighting for a better future, then there will be nothing that America cannot do.
[58:46.400 --> 58:50.400]  Damn the torpedoes, go straight at them.
[59:17.400 --> 59:23.400]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[59:23.400 --> 59:27.400]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[59:27.400 --> 59:34.400]  So if you love coffee, and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[59:34.400 --> 59:37.400]  Order now at the Info Wars store.
[59:37.400 --> 59:45.400]  Sign up for auto ship and get your own high quality supply of Patriot Blend coffee delivered right to your door.
[59:45.400 --> 59:52.400]  At infowarstore.com
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:24.400]  Think about what's happened in just the last few years.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:31.400]  The world government that had been denied is now right out in the open.
[01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:37.400]  And all over the planet, globalists, authoritarian leftists are being voted out of office.
[01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:44.400]  Now they're striking back with trying to start wars and trying to break down borders and trying to break up our families.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:51.400]  It's not going to work in the long run if we stay in the course.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:55.400]  And that's why they always try to make us feel like we're losing.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.400]  That's why they always try to make us feel like we're failing.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.400]  It's because they know they're losers, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:07.400]  They swindle and steal and take everything they get their hands on.
[01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:09.400]  Why does every communist system end up imploding?
[01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.400]  Why does socialist systems end up imploding?
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:18.400]  Why is every blue city and blue state literally offering free piles of, you know what, steaming crap?
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.400]  Why are there needles everywhere?
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:28.400]  Because the evil, dependent, corrupt at the low level all come like flies to, you know what?
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:37.400]  And then the globalists who are evil on the top sit there and administer overall the drug addicts and the mentally ill and the collapse of society.
[01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:43.400]  They sell that paradigm to expand their little kingdoms while they rule over it.
[01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:51.400]  And then get those of us that care, those of us that have a conscience to fund the expansion of evil in the name of fixing society.
[01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.400]  They use our goodwill.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:02:01.400]  They use our real social justice as Christians, as conservatives, as nationalists, as people that care about civilization and society.
[01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:03.400]  Those that want to serve.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:08.400]  They use our goodwill to help build their own paradigms and build their own systems.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:14.400]  And all the studies show this, that leftists, depending on whether it's in the UK or the US or Europe or even Japan,
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:22.400]  are six to nine times more likely to steal, to engage in crime, to not give to charity,
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:31.400]  but way more likely to tell you how charitable they are and to explain to you how you need to be charitable.
[01:02:31.400 --> 01:02:39.400]  It's like Eddie Haskell on steroids and PCP, where it's just constant virtue signaling, constantly trying to guilt you,
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:42.400]  constantly trying to manipulate you because they know those buttons are there.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:46.400]  They just can't stop trying to run your life.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.400]  They just can't stop it.
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400]  And they love political correctness.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.400]  They love saying the American flag's evil and white people are inherently bad.
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.400]  That's white people saying that.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:02.400]  Because if they can push it that far, they can get everybody at each other's throats, and then they are the referees.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:03.400]  They're the jail guards.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:04.400]  They're the warden.
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.400]  You know, prisons break up into black, Hispanic, white, and Asian.
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.400]  And that's how it's done.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.400]  Historically, it's people split into gangs.
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:20.400]  And that's how the warden controls them, is they control them by their gang leaders who administer the justice.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:25.400]  And the more barbarous, the more high security a prison is, the more it's run by the gangs.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.400]  That's how the world really works, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:33.400]  And so we wonder about the Democrats have degenerated, why they're falling apart, why they seem so crazed, why they're so evil.
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:41.400]  It's because they are a criminal gang and they use Hezbollah of Iran and they use MS-13 of Central America.
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:50.400]  As the operating system, the Democrats do to carry out their hits and to launder their money and to do the jobs they want done.
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:58.400]  That's the way it's been for a long time in corrupt systems, and that's the way it is now, where governments use organized crime.
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:05.400]  And because MS-13 is the most vicious, and because Hezbollah is smart and cunning, they are the muscle of the Democrats.
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.400]  But thanks to Trump, they're being executed as we speak.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:10.400]  Yes, that's right.
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:13.400]  Let's be big boys and girls here and admit what's really happening in this country.
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:25.400]  We're in a civil war and the Democrats are freaking out because they work for the Chai comms and others and Trump is chopping all their tentacles off and ripping them out of their rat holes and they're having to walk the plank.
[01:04:25.400 --> 01:04:33.400]  We'll be right back on the other side of this break and I'm going to get into Antifa first and what they did this weekend to see what scum they are.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:38.400]  And then we'll get into the tectonic developments on this planet that are absolutely critical.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:58.400]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.

[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:55.420]  Alex Jones let's cut right to it everybody I talked to in the comments I
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:01.060]  see on info wars and on YouTube when we see Antifa beating up men women and
[01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:05.700]  children throwing acid attacks on people's faces with quickset concrete
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:10.580]  beating people with a head with steel bars splitting their skull down to their
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:17.500]  brain and the police just stand there and do nothing in DC in Portland Oregon in
[01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:24.740]  San Francisco in Austin Texas why are they getting away with it well the
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:29.620]  mayor got caught in Portland last week giving the order and the police have
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:34.820]  gone public with it to stand down and so they follow that illegal order and
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:41.860]  stood down while Antifa ganged up and beat up gay Asian journalist and what
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:47.900]  they are is professors and assistant professors and members of the media and
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:50.780]  members of the federal and state government that's why they docks
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:54.860]  everybody so they have access to your private files and your life your
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:08:01.260]  background your details as they say so security number where you live they
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:04.020]  come out and they have people that they've been looking at who they're
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:09.180]  planning to target and they go out and they physically attack you and the
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:14.420]  police stand there and watch it happen because the police are being blackmailed
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:19.780]  and how are the police being blackmailed remember not this year but last year
[01:08:19.780 --> 01:08:27.820]  we got 30 plus pages of secret documents from an Antifa members brother and his
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:32.380]  family member had ended up having major medical issues and things like that and
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:37.260]  ended up going away for a while and so he was able to get into his apartment and
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:41.340]  get these documents that he was a leader of Antifa it was Alexander Soros
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:46.420]  funding it real documents and it was in Maryland and other cities an action plan
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:51.620]  and one level is you're an actor and you've got liaisons in the in the blue
[01:08:51.620 --> 01:08:57.540]  city police department of the new stands you're gonna attack because they're
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:02.020]  conservative like Washington Cedar or Washington Times and then McDonald's is
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:07.340]  a partner so they're not gonna prosecute you when you knock windows out so it's
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:10.900]  Starbucks they always go to a Starbucks go to McDonald's they're globalist and
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:15.940]  it's all in there go read it right now in infowars.com they never denied it's
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:19.900]  authenticity and experts have come forward and said no that's it's real
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:24.100]  but you see it in action it's always the same and so they're there to try to
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:31.300]  invoke and try to incite other people it says in the document to riot so it's
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:36.220]  always white people in black mask saying to black folks the cops are racist they
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:43.020]  killed your people kill them attack hoping to get a real attack going now
[01:09:43.020 --> 01:09:48.660]  the average cops are just told to stand down but they're senior captains and
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:54.660]  commanders and chiefs have been briefed and they do it under the auspices of
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:10:01.140]  drills so they say it's a drill and then over time they're able to escalate
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:05.780]  escalate escalate into test what will the media let us get away with but not
[01:10:05.780 --> 01:10:12.100]  all the antifa are professors or lawyers or newspaper writers who dress up like
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:16.340]  Batman to go out and they'll be vigilantes they then call out scum
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:22.300]  online on Facebook and Twitter who are just criminals and who want to be able
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:25.940]  to attack people and that's why Pelosi was saying how great Antifa was until
[01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:28.460]  about a year and a half ago in San Francisco when they attacked that
[01:10:28.460 --> 01:10:32.540]  pervigil Antifa was in such a power trip when a thousand of them showed up
[01:10:32.540 --> 01:10:38.980]  they began to attack Democrats and take people's purses and just beat people up
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:43.220]  because it's like sharks in a feeding frenzy sharks will be eating a fish
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:47.260]  taste so good another shark gets bit they start biting that shark they start
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:51.900]  biting other sharks and that's what a shark feeding frenzy looks like well
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:56.900]  that happens in mob psychology as well so here are some of these clips I'm
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:01.820]  gonna talk over them where we have one of the antifa from three different angles
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:09.340]  goes on for like 10 minutes can't light a flag with a match he doesn't even know
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:15.260]  how to use matches and tries to figure that out he didn't even know how to cut
[01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:20.180]  his hand over the flag strike it and then get it going that way or that he
[01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:24.060]  should douse it in lighter fluid before he came out there like when I burn you
[01:11:24.060 --> 01:11:29.740]  in flags ever seen me burn one man they go up real nice with one lighter you'll
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:34.420]  bring a lighter if you're gonna burn an American flag on July 4th but it's all
[01:11:34.420 --> 01:11:39.580]  trying to get people to physically attack him I was sued by the Communist
[01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:46.220]  Revolutionary Party Revco the same ones that were out burning them in DC the
[01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.740]  suit was thrown out I was even there when the American flag got burned they
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.020]  tried to claim that I was in a conspiracy with the police and others to
[01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:56.260]  do it but it matter it got the publicity that I was being sued when they
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:12:01.580]  burned an American flag at the RNC now three years ago think about that in that
[01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:07.060]  wild so now they're back out again trying to burn the American flag waving
[01:12:07.060 --> 01:12:11.140]  it around burning in people's faces hoping they get arrested so they can
[01:12:11.140 --> 01:12:14.860]  make another federal case out of it they won at the Supreme Court the right to
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:18.620]  burn the flag back in the 1980s and I want to be clear you have a right to
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:21.940]  burn the American flag people fought and died for the rights that flag
[01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:27.060]  symbolizes I don't like it it disgusts me but we shouldn't be incited to attack
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:30.540]  them when they do it it's what they want but I'll say this they want to more than
[01:12:30.540 --> 01:12:34.180]  just burn it they want to remove it and when they said that that Betsy Ross flag
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.660]  was racist when she was a famous abolitionist one of the first big
[01:12:37.660 --> 01:12:44.500]  ones her work 70 years later got slavery outlawed you know abolitionist
[01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:48.580]  underground railroad even if somebody that had slaves made the American flag
[01:12:48.580 --> 01:12:52.300]  what does that mean that was back in history they still have slaves in areas
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:57.620]  Africa right now six Muslim countries still have slavery they sell slaves in
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:02.860]  Somalia in Spain so we never have Somalis come here because of that or should
[01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:06.020]  get rid of the Somali flag well actually maybe a river they currently have
[01:13:06.020 --> 01:13:10.420]  slaves yeah the point is is that if they can remove it and say it's bad like the
[01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:13.540]  Ninth Circuit is ruled the American flags a hate symbol can be banned in
[01:13:13.540 --> 01:13:18.460]  public schools and now well they can't get the main American flags let's get the
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:23.660]  one with a circle on it the original maybe folks will let us ban that so you
[01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:26.980]  had him trying to burn the flag we had the group confronting police so finally
[01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:31.140]  the police did something but not when other people got assaulted not when they
[01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:35.300]  were breaking into buildings not when they were throwing newspaper machines
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:40.340]  out the street no nothing was done then they finally intervened a little bit
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:43.660]  when somebody had to make America great again hats stolen this is a better
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:51.420]  response than we normally have I was there in 2016 2017 for the inauguration
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:57.620]  and on January 20th in Antifa was that all the entrances beating up families so
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:01.620]  they couldn't get through and they'd have women on the front line who'd hit you
[01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:05.540]  so you'd hit a woman on tape trying to get through so we pushed through and the
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:09.340]  police came and threatened to arrest us how dare you try to get in there so they
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:12.900]  could show the mall opening with the fences around it and say nobody was in
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:19.380]  there because for two hours Antifa blocked the entrances so CNN could shoot
[01:14:19.380 --> 01:14:23.340]  that video and say nobody was there from the top of the Washington Monument
[01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:27.900]  think about that and then AOC came out this weekend and said nobody was at
[01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:32.580]  Trump's rally and they showed photos from five six hours before it began of
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:38.380]  the mall with only a few hundred people there when it was 400 500 thousand maybe
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:43.260]  a million no one's sure I think about that level of lying but hell she said
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.740]  she saw people drinking out of toilets a week ago so total lie doesn't matter
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.700]  she'll move on to the next slide remember she said the world's gonna end in 12
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:55.260]  years more lies ladies and gentlemen because that's all these individuals can
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:15:02.260]  do Antifa tried to rush the police and get them to attack them again to make
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:08.020]  themselves the victims these people are criminal thugs hours of these incredible

[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:15.300]  dollars on the toothpaste at that price and we're moving a ton okay but you
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.420]  move a couple hundred thousand dollars or something and you get twenty thousand
[01:17:18.420 --> 01:17:21.140]  dollars that doesn't pay for all the infrastructure the bandwidth the lawyers
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:24.220]  the crew so we need to sell millions and millions and millions of dollars a
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:28.180]  product I want to expand not contract and for six months we've not just been

[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:42.300]  need to be retreaded we need to be tuned up we need to be fixed up we never have
[01:17:42.300 --> 01:17:45.820]  time to get into dry we got a lot of holes shot at us and the enemy wants to
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:49.860]  silence us then they're really gonna plant child porn on us then they're
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:52.860]  gonna kill me or you or anybody else me the Democrats now we're going into a
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.380]  full revolutionary fervor funded by foreign banks in the Tricombs so go to
[01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:00.740]  infowarks store.com let's talk to Marcus in New York Marcus you're on the air
[01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:04.700]  thanks for holding. Hey Alex yeah I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air I
[01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:08.020]  talked to a lot of people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell
[01:18:08.020 --> 01:18:12.020]  you is that almost nobody agrees with these wars I think that the Neocons are
[01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:15.860]  trying desperately to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the
[01:18:15.860 --> 01:18:19.540]  only way that they could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching
[01:18:19.540 --> 01:18:22.980]  2020. That's it I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his
[01:18:22.980 --> 01:18:26.020]  presidency it's the only way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.100]  him. It's a time to be praying my friend. I agree entirely and the last thing I
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:32.220]  just want to say Alex is I know they're trying to shut you down but the
[01:18:32.220 --> 01:18:36.300]  reinforcements have arrived man I would love to see you on air until you're 80
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:39.460]  years old I'd love to see what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they
[01:18:39.460 --> 01:18:44.140]  do shut you down no you've gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:47.940]  there are a lot of people like myself and many others who are gonna continue
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.460]  we're gonna keep fighting in the info war and even if something does happen to
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:55.740]  you or your show know for a fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:19:01.220]  for liberty. Thank you sir for calling. There is no longer any doubt multinational

[01:19:59.820 --> 01:20:05.300]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:19.060]  and it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say I don't know what's
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:25.420]  going to happen at the end of this but you want to fight you better believe you've got one
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:50.420]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones I do not hope the
[01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:58.220]  California falls off into the ocean I do not hope that there is a mega quake or
[01:20:58.220 --> 01:21:03.260]  the big one that hits southern or central or northern California or
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:09.180]  anywhere else but sadly ladies and gentlemen when we see hurricanes hit
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:16.060]  Florida Democrats because it went to Trump barely by a few hundred thousand
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:21.540]  votes say they want to see Florida flooded and destroyed think about that
[01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:26.300]  mindset think about how evil that is even if California was all Democrats I
[01:21:26.300 --> 01:21:30.540]  would want to see it fall off in the ocean I would want to see 37 million
[01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:41.420]  people die but here's the facts we live on giant tectonic plates only about 15
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:50.780]  to 30 miles thick those are ships floating on liquid magma and down the
[01:21:50.780 --> 01:21:57.940]  core of the planet nickel core spinning we know for the electromagnetic
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:03.260]  radiation coming out they can even be tracked so imagine we're ships floating
[01:22:03.260 --> 01:22:09.500]  on lava and we live 75 years on average that's a blip on the radar screen not
[01:22:09.500 --> 01:22:20.780]  even a blip name a sparkle in your eye and you've got the Caribbean plate it's
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:24.340]  all North America and out into the Atlantic that is up against the
[01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:29.060]  Pacific plate the biggest plate the ring of fire and we are almost 30 years
[01:22:29.060 --> 01:22:34.980]  depending on which expert you talk to 27 to 30 years out overdue for a big one
[01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:39.460]  with all of the predictions and scans they've got everywhere else has had the
[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:49.460]  big mega quakes the 8.1s stuff like Fukushima 200-foot tsunamis ground
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:55.140]  opening up like out of movie San Andreas when we're talking cataclysmic
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:01.300]  situation and when you had that first shock there was a six what was it six
[01:23:01.300 --> 01:23:05.380]  one six two six four that you know that they've been debating it from where they
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:11.380]  read it that devastated a lot of stuff for hundreds of square miles if it hit
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:15.300]  la it would have been thousands of fires hundreds of billions of damage but
[01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:22.300]  it hit north of there northeast but they're now predicting you know then
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:27.100]  they said oh this is the main event well then there was a bigger event that was a
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:32.860]  seven plus some estimates are up 11 times stronger other estimates five times
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:37.700]  stronger the point is depends how you read these numbers these are big
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.660]  earthquakes that are overdue and there could be a another giant event today
[01:23:42.660 --> 01:23:46.500]  tomorrow the next week and what's really concerning seismologist
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:51.980]  volcanologist and other folks to study these things is that Yellowstone has the
[01:23:51.980 --> 01:23:58.100]  highest level geysers it was close to the record three days ago now the geysers
[01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:01.780]  it's being reported are the highest recorded since they've been recording
[01:24:01.780 --> 01:24:06.980]  for 150 years the water shooting out of there from the boiling lava down
[01:24:06.980 --> 01:24:11.100]  below and there's all sorts of mini quakes going on and if you understand
[01:24:11.100 --> 01:24:16.380]  the Rocky Mountains were pushed up by mega quakes from the Pacific
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:23.180]  rim Pacific plate that big one it's bigger than like seven eight blades
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:31.300]  combined it's pushing up against the plate that the United States is
[01:24:31.300 --> 01:24:37.060]  floating on or or is the plate of the Caribbean plate that's pushing up under
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:41.980]  there Pacific plates pushing under pushing up the Rockies where you've
[01:24:41.980 --> 01:24:48.580]  got that super volcano where it tends to blow up and sometimes cover almost the
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:54.060]  all of North America in ash people for depending on the maps they've got 500 to
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:57.860]  a thousand miles in all directions will be dead like Pompeii Pompeii's a little
[01:24:57.860 --> 01:25:01.660]  volcano and the city down below everybody died instantly you're talking
[01:25:01.660 --> 01:25:07.940]  about Denver all those places bye-bye everybody's dead 15 feet of molten ash
[01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:12.540]  hits you everything explodes burns down you're all dead you could be in a
[01:25:12.540 --> 01:25:18.580]  basement you mean where you're dead you're talking about boiling ash hitting
[01:25:18.580 --> 01:25:23.380]  you you'll be frozen in place like Pompeii that's just where we live that's
[01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:26.300]  the universe that's the reality you know I shot a report on this yesterday and I
[01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:31.420]  pointed out that most elites believe we're a simulation and that they had
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:34.620]  been saying they thought asteroids hit us every million years or so that could
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:38.440]  you know cause a nuclear winter cause the skies to darken cause the new
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.700]  ice age now they know from watching other planets they're getting hit every
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:47.820]  couple years by comets by asteroids Jupiter and Saturn it's been observed
[01:25:47.820 --> 01:25:52.220]  have had comets and asteroids hit them that blow holes in the gas giants bigger
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:59.740]  than earth a comet just four or five miles across will blow a hole bigger
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:05.180]  than the earth in a gas giant there's been famous cases of shoemaker Levy in
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:09.780]  that comet what it did hitting a gas giant so now they're suddenly telling
[01:26:09.780 --> 01:26:13.460]  you in the Wall Street Journal the asteroid peril isn't science fiction
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:20.180]  they hit us more often than we think think about that so my point is we live
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:24.900]  in a volatile universe we live in an amazing universe and if it really is a
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:30.140]  simulation that's why the ancients said we need to pray to God to protect us
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:33.940]  because God's running the simulation and now almost all the tech heads believe
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:37.260]  it's a simulation by some outside entity that they want to create new
[01:26:37.260 --> 01:26:42.180]  simulations and new break-off realities well that's the devil to the fallen you
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.700]  know come with me I'll build a new reality the truth is this is not a
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:54.940]  simulation it is a third-dimension real genetic map with real matter and real
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:27:01.260]  discoveries for us to make with higher dimensional order of the spirit from the
[01:27:01.260 --> 01:27:06.540]  fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth tenth eleventh dimension overlaid by the way
[01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:09.700]  people see Elon Musk talk about this they go wait you're on Joe Rogan show and
[01:27:09.700 --> 01:27:12.900]  a year later Elon Musk says it word for word but you know I must as I met the
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:15.460]  meetings with the heads of Google Facebook and Twitter and they're all
[01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:19.460]  into this it's an AI cult but they believe they're gonna ascend by creating a
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.860]  new reality and breaking away from this one so they actually have taken on
[01:27:22.860 --> 01:27:29.260]  Lucifer's actual prime directive of this is a false reality made by this God I'm
[01:27:29.260 --> 01:27:33.940]  gonna build a new reality come with me but the devil can't build like we can
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:38.780]  we're built in God's image of the angels aren't they can't build like we can they
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:43.660]  can manipulate us to build something for them and that's what this is all
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:49.300]  twisted all given to us with Trojan horses we built it but that they put an
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:54.460]  evil twist on it by twisting us now that is the maximum level thought of the
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:59.180]  highest Illuminati highest level Christian organizations that are opposing
[01:27:59.180 --> 01:28:03.060]  it and Trump is opposing it but he doesn't get the whole thing he shouldn't
[01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:06.540]  be supporting 5g I'll tell you that and by the way I didn't just tell you some
[01:28:06.540 --> 01:28:10.300]  wild deal when I say it the media makes fun of it but it gets 40 million views
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:13.860]  Joe Rogan has scientists on this had the same thing it's a million views but
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:18.060]  oh they're smart when they say it they're all pushing you this new multi
[01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:23.260]  dimension or artificial dimension system so that you will go with them just like
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:29.380]  Lucifer tried to get the angels so it's it's here it is NBC news are we living
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:32.740]  in a simulated universe here's what scientists say see they're pushing this
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:37.780]  everything on July 5th all this is coming out all this is unfolding but I'm
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:41.740]  going to tell you on the other side how you can ensure victory for your spirit

[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:50.900]  explain that the biggest secret the enemy doesn't want you to know when we
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:53.580]  come back to the other side
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:29:03.700]  we will always be the people who defeated a tyrant cross the cotton
[01:29:03.700 --> 01:29:10.740]  arna science took to the skies and soared into the heavens because we will
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:18.340]  never forget that we are Americans and the future belongs to us
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:27.020]  the future belongs to the brave the strong the proud and the free we are

[01:32:01.340 --> 01:32:05.340]  Hey I just want to say your show is a breath of fresh air I talked to a lot of
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:08.700]  people here out in New York City and one thing I could tell you is that almost
[01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:12.820]  nobody agrees with these war I think that the neocons are trying desperately
[01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:16.740]  to get Trump to go to a war because they know that that's the only way that they
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:20.540]  could defeat him in the eyes of the public the approaching 2020 that's it
[01:32:20.540 --> 01:32:23.740]  I mean if Trump buys into this it'll be the end of his presidency it's the only
[01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:26.700]  way I think he can be defeated other than assassinating him it's the time to be
[01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.980]  praying my friend I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:33.500]  I know they're trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man
[01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:37.180]  I would love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I would love to see
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:40.820]  what you're talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've
[01:32:40.820 --> 01:32:45.100]  gone into this war you've won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:48.940]  like myself and many others who are gonna continue we're gonna keep fighting in
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:52.740]  the info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a
[01:32:52.740 --> 01:32:56.900]  fact that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for
[01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:59.100]  calling
[01:32:59.100 --> 01:33:06.180]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:33:16.660 --> 01:33:20.340]  there are thousands and thousands of interesting things happening that we
[01:33:20.340 --> 01:33:24.020]  could talk about that would be entertaining but I want to talk about
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:28.300]  things that really affect the universe and really affect the world the best
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:34.700]  thinking of the most powerful people in the world who are both on the dark side
[01:33:34.700 --> 01:33:40.340]  and on the good side is that we are interdimensional beings spirit
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:46.260]  creatures and that there are all these dimensions around us that mathematics and
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:53.900]  science has proven and that our bodies are temples that hold our spirit and
[01:33:53.900 --> 01:33:58.660]  that going back to all of our ancestors wherever we really came from obviously
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:04.260]  not from this planet that's what the establishment believes as well that each
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:09.740]  body carries the genetic splice of our ancestors together and their genetic
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:15.660]  memories or their epigenetics and that going forward then people feel like
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:20.660]  they've been reincarnated because they are experiencing the owner's manual the
[01:34:20.660 --> 01:34:27.340]  life map of kindred spirits of their families of their ancestors who live
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:31.500]  before them that's what instincts are but instincts are just the basics of
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:36.740]  that again they can take chickens that have been 20 generations inside a
[01:34:36.740 --> 01:34:43.300]  building never seen a chicken hawk never seen a hawk they'll kill them eat them
[01:34:43.300 --> 01:34:50.980]  and they can project triangles rectangles on the ceiling with a projector
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:55.860]  and the chickens don't run into the coop and hide you project a hawk they run
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:35:01.300]  at height that is a genetic memory that's a chicken genetic memory we have
[01:35:01.300 --> 01:35:05.100]  genetic memory or race consciousness of the entire species and the globalists
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:11.340]  are obsessed with this and activating them but beyond that we have a new spirit
[01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:16.740]  that goes into the body and then activates all of that lives through that
[01:35:16.740 --> 01:35:21.020]  with its experiences mates with another human and then they splice through
[01:35:21.020 --> 01:35:25.940]  genetics and memory and then pay that forward but the spirit at a quantum level
[01:35:25.940 --> 01:35:30.220]  then also takes the knowledge of that experience to a higher plane and higher
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:38.300]  level just as in this third dimension time-warping genetically it also
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:42.620]  passes on the life and so there is life at all these different levels your
[01:35:42.620 --> 01:35:46.020]  personal life your genetic history in life future genetic lives you're gonna
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:49.300]  have with those that you have babies with and those experiences and those
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.940]  communal experiences and experiencing your grandparents and great grandparents
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:57.140]  and people from a thousand years ago or a million years ago or from wherever your
[01:35:57.140 --> 01:36:00.580]  ancestors came from interfacing with your daughter or your son and it's like
[01:36:00.580 --> 01:36:03.500]  you're talking to your grandparents you don't know why because you are it's all
[01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:08.700]  magic it's all real and so Elon Musk who's been with the top globalist and
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:12.660]  Bill Joy who's been with them have all said they plan on a silicon god they're
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:15.700]  getting rid of humanity they know that it's all interdimensional they want to
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:21.140]  block all that off they've made some dark deal beware soon as Elon said that
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:23.900]  they came after his companies they are tacting they did all this terrible
[01:36:23.900 --> 01:36:28.860]  stuff because he knows the truth folks and I know the truth so I was on about
[01:36:28.860 --> 01:36:32.460]  six eight months whatever it was before he was on he came on and repeated
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:36.220]  basically what I said but he wasn't plagiarizing me he was telling you the
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:39.260]  same thing because he's been at the highest levels with these people and
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:43.860]  this is their religion but a twisted form of knowing this but not letting you
[01:36:43.860 --> 01:36:49.100]  know this I say let everybody know the truth and it's even more advanced than
[01:36:49.100 --> 01:36:52.300]  I've laid out here it's it's incredible when you see the mastery of it what God
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:57.780]  built it's unbelievable but we are a symbiotic genetic creature but we also
[01:36:57.780 --> 01:37:01.500]  have a spirit that's individual that goes forward into the future but also
[01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:06.820]  carries that data on to a larger level and it's just beautiful it's amazing and
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:11.100]  the globalists are trying to short circuit it to become God now in closing
[01:37:11.100 --> 01:37:16.660]  before I air the Elon Musk Alex Jones juxtapose from the Joe Rogan show in this
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:21.900]  into this segment the next we're gonna have a special 1776 worldwide second
[01:37:21.900 --> 01:37:27.460]  American Revolution is launched 36-hour broadcast that kicks off Thursday
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:31.780]  morning at 8 a.m. with David Knight and runs right through the next day when the
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:36.260]  world war room ends with Owen Troyer at 6 p.m. I'm gonna have a bunch of special
[01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:39.700]  guests who've just been inside the White House meeting with the president with
[01:37:39.700 --> 01:37:43.180]  what the inside baseball is that we already have a lot of on on the next
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:46.820]  fight against big tech censorship and that right of freedom so that's coming
[01:37:46.820 --> 01:37:53.340]  up and please don't forget info or store.com has the Betsy Ross flags shirts
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:56.900]  in navy blue and white that say these colors don't run on the front on the
[01:37:56.900 --> 01:38:02.100]  back it says it's just awesome it says America's back in fours.com another
[01:38:02.100 --> 01:38:08.580]  version on the front says since 1776 Betsy Ross flag on the back says America's
[01:38:08.580 --> 01:38:13.420]  back in fours.com this could really fund some key initiatives I've got because
[01:38:13.420 --> 01:38:16.700]  it's gone crazy with their censorship of the Betsy Ross flag and Kaepernick and
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:21.060]  Nike and all that pulling the shoes I said we print 4,000 1000 of each variant
[01:38:21.060 --> 01:38:24.820]  those are gonna be sold out by tomorrow so that'll be a special edition you'll
[01:38:24.820 --> 01:38:27.780]  get your special edition we'll have a new variant that comes out in the next few
[01:38:27.780 --> 01:38:31.180]  days to fund the operation at info or store.com but people are excited about
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:35.300]  this it funds the info or you get a great shirt to put it in the face of the
[01:38:35.300 --> 01:38:39.100]  tyrants and the censors it is a win-win-win on every front so get your
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:43.980]  Betsy Ross flag in navy blue or in white at info or store.com or call toll
[01:38:43.980 --> 01:38:47.340]  three triple eight two five three three one three nine because the funding of us
[01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:50.900]  the third dimension is what gives us the ability to build the systems to
[01:38:50.900 --> 01:38:54.420]  communicate and punch through the enemy operations to actually try to trigger and
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:58.540]  activate your real human destiny and potential but when we come knocking you've
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:03.580]  got to open the door. I'm Alex Jones this is infowars.com for Space Force stay
[01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:07.780]  with us we'll be right back with Elon Musk and more.
[01:39:07.780 --> 01:39:26.700]  I'm watching the midterms then you would think our country is Mad Max Thunderdome.
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:33.060]  This guy is like they're coming from Guatemala they're coming from Mexico
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:37.060]  there's a liberal mob that's coming.
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:51.060]  More in the present.
[01:39:52.060 --> 01:39:53.060]  You're a support.
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:40:04.060]  You're a support.
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:17.060]  And you would think everybody in the countries is like to the bunker.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:29.060]  The elite are all about transcendence and living forever and the secrets of the
[01:40:29.060 --> 01:40:32.060]  universe and they want to know all the some are good some are bad some are a
[01:40:32.060 --> 01:40:35.060]  mix but the good ones don't ever want to organize.
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:38.060]  The bad ones didn't want to organize because they lost after power.
[01:40:38.060 --> 01:40:42.060]  Powerful consciousnesses don't want to dominate other people they want to
[01:40:42.060 --> 01:40:45.060]  empower them so they don't tend to get together until things are really late in
[01:40:45.060 --> 01:40:48.060]  the game then they come together evil's always defeated because good is so much
[01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:53.060]  stronger and we're on this planet and Einstein's physics shot at Max Planck's
[01:40:53.060 --> 01:40:56.060]  physics shutter all there's at least 12 dimensions and now that's all the top
[01:40:56.060 --> 01:41:00.060]  scientists and billionaires are coming out saying it's a false hologram it is
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:05.060]  artificial the computers are scanning it and finding tension points where it's
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:10.060]  artificially projected and gravity's bleeding in to this universe that's what
[01:41:10.060 --> 01:41:15.060]  they call dark matter so we're like a thought or a dream that's a wisp in
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:19.060]  some computer programs some God's mind whatever they're proving it all it's all
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:20.060]  coming out.
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:26.060]  I think most likely this is just about probability there are many many simulations
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:31.060]  these simulations are we might as well call them reality or you could call them
[01:41:31.060 --> 01:41:32.060]  multiverse.
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:36.060]  These simulations you believe are created like someone has manufactured.
[01:41:36.060 --> 01:41:38.060]  They're running on the substrate.
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:43.060]  Now there's like this sub-transmission zone below the third dimension that's just
[01:41:43.060 --> 01:41:47.060]  turned over the most horrible things is what it resonates to and it's trying to
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:51.060]  get up into the third dimension that's just a basic level consciousness to launch
[01:41:51.060 --> 01:41:56.060]  into the next levels and our species is already way up in the fifth sixth dimension
[01:41:56.060 --> 01:42:00.060]  consciously our best people but there's this big war trying to like basically
[01:42:00.060 --> 01:42:05.060]  destroy humanity because humanity has free will and there's a decision to which
[01:42:05.060 --> 01:42:09.060]  level we want to go to we have free will so evil's allowed to come and contend
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:15.060]  and not just good and they at least themselves believe they're racing or
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:20.060]  using human technology to try to take our best minds and build some type of
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:24.060]  breakaway civilization where they're going to merge with machines transcend
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:28.060]  and break away from the failed species of this man which is kind of like a
[01:42:28.060 --> 01:42:31.060]  false transmission because they're thinking what they are is ugly and bad
[01:42:31.060 --> 01:42:35.060]  projecting and onto themselves instead of believing no it's a human test about
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:37.060]  building us up.
[01:42:37.060 --> 01:42:44.060]  Well that's the scenario the emerged scenario with AI is the one that seems
[01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:52.060]  like probably the best for us yes like if you if you can't beat it join it
[01:42:52.060 --> 01:43:18.060]  that's yeah you know
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:22.060]  76 style experiment in the expression of the freedom of press and freedom of
[01:43:22.060 --> 01:43:25.060]  speech that in fact the founders were so concerned with at the beginning of the
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:29.060]  country they actually tried to support and subsidize organizations just like
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:32.060]  this because this was the kind of press they wanted and then ultimately we now
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:36.060]  live in an era where they've mostly been blocked by big corporations or billionaire
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:40.060]  sugar daddies who've been able to control and manipulate what news and views
[01:43:40.060 --> 01:43:44.060]  the person's allowed to have or express or hear and the M4's audience has broken
[01:43:44.060 --> 01:43:49.060]  through that they are the bridge from the founding to the modern age ultimate
[01:43:49.060 --> 01:43:52.060]  American democracy and freedom and that's why there's been an unprecedented
[01:43:52.060 --> 01:43:58.060]  onslaught of the platforming defamation lawfare and libel targeting you
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:04.060]  serving with info wars is a great honor but I still need my morning coffee and
[01:44:04.060 --> 01:44:09.060]  luckily our break room at the info wars headquarters is stocked full of high

[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:30.060]  I agree entirely and the last thing I just want to say Alex is I know they're
[01:45:30.060 --> 01:45:33.060]  trying to shut you down but the reinforcements have arrived man I would
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:37.060]  love to see you on air until you're 80 years old I'd love to see what you're
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:41.060]  talking about when you're 80 but if they do shut you down no you've gone into
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:45.060]  this war you won a lot of battles and there are a lot of people like myself
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:48.060]  and many others who are going to continue we're going to keep fighting in the
[01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:53.060]  info war and even if something does happen to you or your show know for a fact
[01:45:53.060 --> 01:45:58.060]  that you've gotten a lot of people fired up for liberty thank you sir for calling
[01:45:58.060 --> 01:46:02.060]  I talk about this on the air and I know it sinks into people but I've decided
[01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:05.060]  that we're going to kind of reboot all our supplements in that if you go back
[01:46:05.060 --> 01:46:08.060]  five six years ago before all the censorship and attacks and fake lawsuits
[01:46:08.060 --> 01:46:11.060]  the rest of it I would talk about how great the products are and how they were
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:15.060]  the best and why they were and I have doctors on an experts to explain why they
[01:46:15.060 --> 01:46:18.060]  were so good and instead the last few years I'm like hey we need to really
[01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:21.060]  support us or they'll shut us down the biggest thing people like to buy is
[01:46:21.060 --> 01:46:23.060]  supplements because they know how great they are and how wonderful they were
[01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:27.060]  and the left always has headlines everywhere. Joan sells unapproved
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:32.060]  supplements that he claims are supplements no under federal law since 1996
[01:46:32.060 --> 01:46:36.060]  you can't say that a supplement has been through the FDA because they have no
[01:46:36.060 --> 01:46:39.060]  jurisdiction and won't look at it but then they say you've got to say it's not
[01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:43.060]  approved by them and all drugs are is the system trying to tweak what's in mother
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:46.060]  nature and manipulate it and do different things and a lot of drugs work
[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:50.060]  great they have side effects not with mother nature but big pharma doesn't want
[01:46:50.060 --> 01:46:55.060]  you knowing about God's medicine chest info or store dot com or triple eight two
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:59.060]  five three three one three nine
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:06.060]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:06.060 --> 01:47:15.060]  so from a long-term existential standpoint that's like the purpose of
[01:47:15.060 --> 01:47:22.060]  Neuralink is to create a high bandwidth interface to the brain such that we can
[01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:28.060]  be symbolic with AI because we have a bandwidth problem you can't communicate
[01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:34.060]  through your fingers it's too slow and so Google was set up 18 19 years ago this
[01:47:34.060 --> 01:47:37.060]  was I knew about this before it was declassified I'm just saying I have good
[01:47:37.060 --> 01:47:42.060]  sources that they wanted to build a giant artificial system and Google believes
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:47.060]  that the first artificial intelligence will be a supercomputer based on the
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:52.060]  neuron activities of the hive mind of humanity with billions of people wired
[01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:56.060]  into the Internet of Saints and so all of our thoughts go into it and we're
[01:47:56.060 --> 01:48:00.060]  actually building a computer that has real neurons in real time that's also
[01:48:00.060 --> 01:48:05.060]  psychically connected to us that are organic creatures so that they will have
[01:48:05.060 --> 01:48:10.060]  current prediction powers future prediction powers a true crystal ball
[01:48:10.060 --> 01:48:14.060]  but the big secret is once you have a crystal ball and know the future you
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:18.060]  can add stimuli beforehand and make decisions that control the future and
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:22.060]  so then it's the end of consciousness and free will for individuals as we know
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:28.060]  and a true 2.0 in a very bad way hive mind consciousness with an AI jacked into
[01:48:28.060 --> 01:48:32.060]  everyone knowing our hopes and dreams delivering it to us not in some PKD
[01:48:32.060 --> 01:48:36.060]  wirehead system where we plug in and give up on consciousness because of unlimited
[01:48:36.060 --> 01:48:40.060]  pleasure but because we were already wired in absorbed before we knew it by
[01:48:40.060 --> 01:48:44.060]  giving over our consciousness to the system our daily decisions that it was
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:48.060]  able to manipulate and control into a larger system this is like a collective
[01:48:48.060 --> 01:48:56.060]  AI in in the Google sort of search Google search you know the where we're
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:49:04.060]  also plugged in as like like nodes on the network like leaves on a big tree
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:10.060]  off and we're all feeding this network without questions and answers we're all
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:17.060]  collectively programming the AI and the and Google plus the older humans that
[01:49:17.060 --> 01:49:23.060]  connect to it are one giant cybernet collective this is also true of Facebook
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:30.060]  and Twitter and Instagram and all these social networks the giant cybernet
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:36.060]  collectives there's now a human counter strike taking place to shut this off
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:40.060]  before it gets fully into place and to block these systems and to try to have
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:44.060]  an actual debate about where humanity goes and cut off the pedophiles and psychic
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:48.060]  vampires that are control of this AI system before humanity's destroyed
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:53.060]  when humanity is only controlled of AI how they get how the pedophiles getting
[01:49:53.060 --> 01:49:57.060]  control the pet the pedophiles in a whatever level rule the devil whatever
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:50:00.060]  you would call this interdimensional thing that gives them advanced off-world
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:03.060]  technology the fallen one the son of this world is giving them advanced knowledge
[01:50:03.060 --> 01:50:07.060]  what are you talking to me what is that I've already been used before on other
[01:50:07.060 --> 01:50:12.060]  populations what that's Satan but what are you talking about let's say explain
[01:50:12.060 --> 01:50:15.060]  that you just you're saying something something that you know the stupid
[01:50:15.060 --> 01:50:18.060]  creature tells you about who's totally controlled or something you read about
[01:50:18.060 --> 01:50:23.060]  on you know in the news or TV right this is an interdimensional force that
[01:50:23.060 --> 01:50:27.060]  wants to influence us to build something that absorbs us and kills us rather
[01:50:27.060 --> 01:50:32.060]  than the divine free will we're given to build something much better than
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:36.060]  empowers the species so the species is now making a decision we're you getting
[01:50:36.060 --> 01:50:39.060]  it's our future where you getting this from from that's what it is but where
[01:50:39.060 --> 01:50:43.060]  you getting it I know from the from looking at all the data researching it
[01:50:43.060 --> 01:50:47.060]  studying it watching the enemy that's the big decision that humanity is now
[01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:51.060]  got before us humans and electronics all interfacing and constantly now
[01:50:51.060 --> 01:50:58.060]  constantly connected yes constantly one of things that I've been thinking about
[01:50:58.060 --> 01:51:03.060]  a lot over the last few years is that one of the things that drives a lot of
[01:51:03.060 --> 01:51:06.060]  people crazies how many people are obsessed with materialism and getting the
[01:51:06.060 --> 01:51:12.060]  latest greatest thing and I wonder how much of that is well a lot of it is
[01:51:12.060 --> 01:51:16.060]  most certainly fueling technology and innovation it almost seems like it's
[01:51:16.060 --> 01:51:20.060]  built into us it's like what we like and what we want that we're fueling this
[01:51:20.060 --> 01:51:24.060]  thing that's constantly around us all the time and it doesn't seem possible that
[01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:27.060]  people are going to pump the brakes it doesn't seem possible at this stage
[01:51:27.060 --> 01:51:32.060]  we're constantly expecting the newest cell phone the latest Tesla update the
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:36.060]  newest MacBook Pro everything has to be newer and better and that's going to
[01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:44.060]  lead to some incredible point and it seems like it's built into us
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:48.060]  almost seems like it's an instinct that we were working towards this that we
[01:51:48.060 --> 01:51:53.060]  like it mm-hmm our job just like the ants build the ant hill our job is to
[01:51:53.060 --> 01:52:02.060]  somehow know the fuel this yes I mean I made this comment some some years ago
[01:52:02.060 --> 01:52:08.060]  but it feels like we are the biological bootloader for AI effectively we are
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:16.060]  building it and then we're building progressively greater intelligence and
[01:52:16.060 --> 01:52:22.060]  the percentage of intelligence that is not human is increasing and eventually
[01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:30.060]  we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence but the AI is
[01:52:30.060 --> 01:52:39.060]  informed strangely by the human limbic system it is in large part our
[01:52:39.060 --> 01:52:48.060]  Idrit large how so we mentioned all those things the sort of primal drives mm-hmm
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:59.060]  there's all all the things that we like and hate and fear they're all there on
[01:52:59.060 --> 01:53:05.060]  the internet their projection of Olympic system
[01:53:11.060 --> 01:53:16.060]  no it makes sense and the thinking of it as a I mean think of thinking of
[01:53:16.060 --> 01:53:19.060]  corporations and just thinking of just human beings communicating online through
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:24.060]  the social media networks of some sort of an organism that's a it's a cyborg
[01:53:24.060 --> 01:53:32.060]  it's a combination it's a combination of electronics and biology yeah this is in
[01:53:32.060 --> 01:53:37.060]  some it's a measure like is that the success of these online systems is that
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:45.060]  is a sort of a function of of how much limbic resonance they're able to achieve
[01:53:45.060 --> 01:53:53.060]  with people the more limbic resonance the more engagement mm-hmm whereas like
[01:53:53.060 --> 01:53:59.060]  one of the reasons why probably Instagram is more enticing than Twitter limbic
[01:53:59.060 --> 01:54:04.060]  resonance yeah you get more images more video yes tweaking your system more
[01:54:04.060 --> 01:54:10.060]  yes do you worry about or wonder in fact about what the next step is I mean a
[01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:13.060]  lot of you didn't see Twitter coming that you know communicate with 140
[01:54:13.060 --> 01:54:20.060]  characters or 280 now would be a thing that people would be interested in like
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:27.060]  it's gonna excel it's gonna become more connected to us right yes things are
[01:54:27.060 --> 01:54:31.060]  getting more and more connected there at this point constrained by bandwidth our
[01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:37.060]  input output is slow particularly output output got worse with thumbs you know
[01:54:37.060 --> 01:54:44.060]  you have input with ten ten fingers now we have thumbs but images are just are
[01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:49.060]  also a there a way of communicating at high bandwidth take pictures and you send
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:53.060]  pictures people what sends that's that communicates far more information than
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:57.060]  you can communicate with thumbs so what happened with you were you decided or
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:02.060]  you took on a more fatalistic attitude like what was there any specific thing
[01:55:02.060 --> 01:55:16.060]  or was it just the inevitability of our future I try to convince people to slow
[01:55:16.060 --> 01:55:27.060]  down slow down AI to regulate AI this was futile I tried for years this is nobody
[01:55:27.060 --> 01:55:35.060]  listen in a movie nobody listen nobody listen nobody listen no one are people
[01:55:35.060 --> 01:55:39.060]  more inclined to listen today it seems like an issue that's brought up more
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:43.060]  often over the last few years than it was maybe five ten years ago it seemed like
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:53.060]  science fiction maybe they will so far they haven't I think people don't like
[01:55:53.060 --> 01:56:03.060]  the normally the way that's regulations work very slow very slow indeed so usually
[01:56:03.060 --> 01:56:10.060]  it'll be something some new technology it will cause damage or death there will be
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:17.060]  an outcry there will be investigation years will pass there will be some sort
[01:56:17.060 --> 01:56:22.060]  of insight committee there will be rulemaking then there will be oversight
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:27.060]  eventually regulations this all takes many years this is the normal course of
[01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:32.060]  things if you look at say automotive regulations how long did it take for
[01:56:32.060 --> 01:56:37.060]  seat belts to be to be implemented to be required you know the auto industry
[01:56:37.060 --> 01:56:43.060]  fort seat belts I think for more than a decade successfully fort any regulations
[01:56:43.060 --> 01:56:49.060]  on seat belts even though the numbers are extremely obvious if you had a seat
[01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:55.060]  belt on you would be far less likely to die will be certainly entered is
[01:56:55.060 --> 01:57:04.060]  unequivocal and the industry fort this for years successfully eventually after
[01:57:04.060 --> 01:57:15.060]  many many people died regulators insisted on deep belts this is a this time frame
[01:57:15.060 --> 01:57:20.060]  is not relevant to AI you can't take ten years from the point which is dangerous
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:32.060]  so late and you feel like this is decades away or years away from being too late
[01:57:32.060 --> 01:57:37.060]  if you have this fatalistic attitude and you feel like it's going we're in a
[01:57:37.060 --> 01:57:42.060]  almost like a doomsday countdown it's not necessarily a doomsday countdown
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:47.060]  it's it's a out of control countdown out of control yeah people called the
[01:57:47.060 --> 01:57:51.060]  single hour what is big tech become a big tech or big babies that have become
[01:57:51.060 --> 01:57:54.060]  big bullies and the way they did so is because they face no consequence of
[01:57:54.060 --> 01:57:58.060]  social economic political or legal for their illicit activities over two
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:02.060]  decades and because of that that's why the courts the judges the juries the
[01:58:02.060 --> 01:58:05.060]  members of the independent free press that care about this the ordinary
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:08.060]  members of the public in the audience that care about this has to bring real
[01:58:08.060 --> 01:58:12.060]  social political economic consequence to their course of conduct otherwise they
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:15.060]  will never change and they will become the big tech oligarchs the equivalent
[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:18.060]  to the big trust of the 19th century who ran American politics and ran
[01:58:18.060 --> 01:58:21.060]  American economy almost into the ground until we were able to recover after
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:25.060]  the Great Depression the inforce audience is the fuel that flames the
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:29.060]  light of liberty across the world to make real the actions of independent free
[01:58:29.060 --> 01:58:33.060]  speech to make real the original promise of an independent free press real
[01:58:33.060 --> 01:58:36.060]  collusion is big tech and big media manipulating and working with each other
[01:58:36.060 --> 01:58:40.060]  to try to meddle with elections to try to shake people's thoughts and then the
[01:58:40.060 --> 01:58:43.060]  whopper of telling us the whole time it's not happening it's the ultimate form of
[01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:47.060]  gaslighting what you just saw isn't what you just saw even it is what let me just
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:55.060]  talk about the most banned network in the world viewers and listeners I wouldn't
[01:58:55.060 --> 01:58:59.060]  be here if it wasn't for you and we're under unprecedented evil attacks as
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:59:03.060]  you've seen but I wanted to take just a minute out here from the bottom of my
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:07.060]  heart to tell you how much it means to me that when you saw those lies against
[01:59:07.060 --> 01:59:10.060]  us last week the worst things you can say about people that you knew they were
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:13.060]  liars you went and looked it up and found out the truth and so I feel very
[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:17.060]  strong and I feel God's hand on my shoulder and I feel your love in my heart
[01:59:17.060 --> 01:59:20.060]  I want you to know that love is right back at you and I want to thank you for
[01:59:20.060 --> 01:59:23.060]  all you've done with your word of mouth and your prayers and your financial
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:27.060]  support because I'm committed to fight to the end but I want to win and without
[01:59:27.060 --> 01:59:31.060]  you I'm going to be destroyed and it's not going to be fun but that's not
[01:59:31.060 --> 01:59:35.060]  what's important the enemy could win we're a key chess piece in this fight
[01:59:35.060 --> 01:59:39.060]  we're being used by God you're being used by God this is Providence so I salute
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:45.060]  you and I thank you for all you've done from the bottom of my heart
