[00:00.000 --> 00:17.120]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[00:17.120 --> 00:24.280]  It's Black Friday the 24th of November 2017, I'm going to be live here for the next four
[00:24.280 --> 00:25.280]  hours.
[00:25.280 --> 00:27.280]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:27.280 --> 00:29.280]  This is the Info War.
[00:29.280 --> 00:34.240]  Wow, top brands pull YouTube ads over pedophilia fears.
[00:34.240 --> 00:40.200]  It's true, they have a lot of very, very serious stuff, sexualizing children on the
[00:40.200 --> 00:41.200]  Google platform.
[00:41.200 --> 00:45.360]  We're going to be discussing that we've got Black Friday Madness videos and so much
[00:45.360 --> 00:51.520]  more, but first a powerful report from our own John Bowne.
[00:51.520 --> 00:55.920]  You might be an evil stain on humanity when the prime minister of your native country
[00:55.920 --> 00:59.440]  starts a television and billboard campaign against you.
[00:59.440 --> 01:04.760]  Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban accuses George Soros of claiming that George Soros
[01:04.760 --> 01:10.320]  wanted to settle at least one million immigrants per year and pay them thousands of euros.
[01:10.320 --> 01:40.300]  You're going to be seen reported Soros whose political views are in stark
[01:40.300 --> 01:46.880]  contrast to Budapest ruling the Fidesz party said Monday he had been targeted by an administration
[01:46.880 --> 01:54.120]  stoking anti-Muslim sentiment and employing anti-Semitic tropes reminiscent of the 1930s.
[01:54.120 --> 01:59.680]  Sorry George, the Nazi-esque techniques being used against you excuse doesn't add up when
[01:59.680 --> 02:04.120]  you are on record of actually being proud of turning in your fellow Jews during the
[02:04.120 --> 02:05.120]  Holocaust.
[02:05.120 --> 02:11.720]  When the Nazis occupied Budapest in 1944, George Soros' father was a successful lawyer.
[02:11.720 --> 02:15.600]  He lived on an island in the Danube and liked to commute to work in a rowboat.
[02:15.600 --> 02:20.320]  But knowing there were problems ahead for the Jews, he decided to split his family up.
[02:20.320 --> 02:25.240]  He bought them forged papers and he bribed a government official to take 14-year-old
[02:25.240 --> 02:29.720]  George Soros in and swear that he was his Christian godson.
[02:29.720 --> 02:31.840]  But survival carried a heavy price tag.
[02:31.840 --> 02:36.800]  While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps,
[02:36.800 --> 02:42.480]  George Soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds confiscating property
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.480]  from the Jews.
[02:43.480 --> 02:44.480]  No problem at all.
[02:44.480 --> 02:45.480]  No feeling of guilt.
[02:45.480 --> 02:46.480]  No.
[02:46.480 --> 02:52.160]  For example, that I'm Jewish and here I am watching these people go, I could just as
[02:52.160 --> 02:53.160]  easily be there.
[02:53.160 --> 02:54.160]  I should be there.
[02:54.160 --> 02:55.160]  None of that.
[02:55.160 --> 03:02.840]  Well, actually, funny way, it's just like in markets that if I weren't there, of course
[03:02.840 --> 03:04.280]  I wasn't doing it.
[03:04.280 --> 03:10.320]  But somebody else would be taking it away anyhow, whether I was there or not.
[03:10.320 --> 03:12.040]  I was only a spectator.
[03:12.040 --> 03:14.240]  The property was being taken away.
[03:14.240 --> 03:20.400]  Meanwhile, the leaders and deep pockets attempting to overthrow the country with a variety of
[03:20.400 --> 03:26.760]  anti-American leftist foundations sat down together at the La Costa Resort in Carlsbad,
[03:26.760 --> 03:31.160]  California to discuss a summit that was intended to remain confidential.
[03:31.160 --> 03:36.120]  However, the Washington Free Beacon obtained the internal documents of the summit reporting
[03:36.120 --> 03:40.680]  the Democracy Alliance is a safe place for donors and activists to meet.
[03:40.680 --> 03:45.480]  Guests are instructed not to share members' names with the press and not to post to any
[03:45.480 --> 03:52.000]  social media sites to contact Democracy Alliance if the media or a blogger contacts them and
[03:52.000 --> 03:56.560]  to refrain from leaving sensitive materials out where others may find them.
[03:56.560 --> 03:59.520]  This latter directive was obviously ignored.
[03:59.520 --> 04:05.560]  The agenda for the meeting, titled Beyond Ashtag Resistance, reclaiming our progressive future,
[04:05.560 --> 04:08.800]  lays out three full days of events.
[04:08.800 --> 04:13.560]  Agendas included the fight against Trump's tax proposal, the war against climate change
[04:13.560 --> 04:20.000]  deniers, and a plan of attack on waging war against the progressive version of so-called
[04:20.000 --> 04:21.160]  fake news.
[04:21.160 --> 04:22.640]  And I don't mean CNN.
[04:22.640 --> 04:28.200]  Notable speakers included one of the Democratic Party's propaganda outlets, Brave New Films,
[04:28.200 --> 04:34.000]  a talk with United States Public Enemy No. 1 George Soros, which will be followed by dinner
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.240]  with Nancy Pelosi spewing out a myriad of fabrications about what Americans really want.
[04:40.240 --> 04:45.080]  The rest assured, when the elitists aren't on the beach playing golf or buying Gucci
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.920]  handbags, they will be hard at work figuring out how to take down the exponential populism
[04:50.920 --> 04:55.080]  of the American people with their army of leftist foundations.
[04:55.080 --> 05:00.440]  John Bown reported for Infowars.com.

[05:59.120 --> 06:12.880]  Waging war on corruption.
[06:12.880 --> 06:23.880]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[06:23.880 --> 06:33.880]  This will be a day long remember, we've seen the end of the Clintons, we'll soon see the
[06:33.880 --> 06:34.880]  end of the globalists.
[06:34.880 --> 06:35.880]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[06:35.880 --> 06:36.880]  It's not true.
[06:36.880 --> 06:37.880]  That's impossible.
[06:37.880 --> 07:05.880]  Such a thing as you know it to be true.
[07:05.880 --> 07:17.880]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[07:17.880 --> 07:28.880]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[07:28.880 --> 07:53.880]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[07:53.880 --> 07:57.360]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're live, we're broadcasting worldwide.
[07:57.360 --> 08:02.720]  I'm in studio on this Friday, Black Friday transmission.
[08:02.720 --> 08:04.680]  So much news to cover.
[08:04.680 --> 08:08.040]  Top brands pull YouTube ads over pedophilia fears.
[08:08.040 --> 08:10.880]  That's Fox News, Associated Press, you name it.
[08:10.880 --> 08:15.960]  Wow, I thought mainstream media said that there wasn't a big awakening to pedophilia
[08:15.960 --> 08:18.360]  and people pushing sexualization of children.
[08:18.360 --> 08:19.360]  The truth is it's massive.
[08:19.360 --> 08:24.800]  We're going to have news breaking next week exclusively showing Disney heavily involved
[08:24.800 --> 08:25.800]  in it.
[08:25.800 --> 08:26.800]  Get ready.
[08:26.800 --> 08:29.080]  That's all coming up.
[08:29.080 --> 08:36.360]  We are going to have a huge breakdown of Black Friday mayhem and riots and malls being closed
[08:36.360 --> 08:37.360]  across the country.
[08:37.360 --> 08:39.640]  That news is all on infowars.com.
[08:39.640 --> 08:42.040]  We have the continued slide of the NFL.
[08:42.040 --> 08:46.040]  They've gone from arrogantly trying to be anti-American to now begging people to tune
[08:46.040 --> 08:47.040]  back in.
[08:47.040 --> 08:48.040]  And guess what?
[08:48.040 --> 08:49.040]  Magic's gone.
[08:49.040 --> 08:50.040]  Spell is lifted.
[08:50.040 --> 08:51.040]  Bye-bye.
[08:51.040 --> 08:58.480]  I think of spells, call for Sleeping Beauty to be banned in the UK because princess kisses
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.800]  are illegal because the princess didn't know because she was deep in a trance.
[09:03.800 --> 09:04.800]  So there you go.
[09:04.800 --> 09:05.800]  This is the political correctness.
[09:05.800 --> 09:12.160]  Let the Muslims blow up churches and mosques all over the world every day, cut women's genitals
[09:12.160 --> 09:13.160]  off.
[09:13.160 --> 09:15.080]  The leftists say that's just part of their religion.
[09:15.080 --> 09:16.720]  But ban Sleeping Beauty.
[09:16.720 --> 09:24.800]  That's up on newswars.com and infowars.com with the bombings by Boko Haram.
[09:24.800 --> 09:30.160]  They're in Nigeria, Northern Nigeria, and in the Sinai.
[09:30.160 --> 09:35.000]  They're in Egypt, 235 dead in just one of those attacks.
[09:35.000 --> 09:41.760]  But coming up, grown men fight over toy car here on Black Friday, America's new trick
[09:41.760 --> 09:45.680]  to beat Black Friday crowds where employee uniforms.
[09:45.680 --> 09:46.880]  It is bedlam.
[09:46.880 --> 09:54.480]  Meanwhile, Soros views nation state as a problem once one world government says senator.
[09:54.480 --> 09:56.400]  It's all coming up today.
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.280]  But first, I want to air just part of a powerful Millie Weaver report that Millie Weaver and
[10:01.280 --> 10:04.120]  Gavin Wentz shot last night and today.
[10:04.120 --> 10:06.240]  It's up on infowars.com.
[10:06.240 --> 10:08.400]  Black Friday has stolen Thanksgiving.
[10:08.400 --> 10:14.520]  Here's part of this important report.
[10:14.520 --> 10:20.320]  Millie Weaver reporting for infowars.com and a happy Thanksgiving to you all.
[10:20.320 --> 10:24.760]  I am here at a Walmart in Austin, Texas.
[10:24.760 --> 10:27.800]  Well, here's what's interesting here.
[10:27.800 --> 10:31.800]  Black Friday is on Friday, not on Thursday.
[10:31.800 --> 10:37.680]  However, many businesses such as Walmart, Target, even the local malls around here have
[10:37.680 --> 10:44.440]  all opened on Thanksgiving so that people can get their early Black Friday deals.
[10:44.440 --> 10:50.000]  So that come Black Friday, there's not as big of a frenzy as we've seen in the past.
[10:50.000 --> 10:55.000]  We've seen people jumping on each other, tasing each other, attacking each other,
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  macing, punching.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.400]  I mean, it's all out madness when people think that they're going to get a deal.
[11:01.400 --> 11:07.400]  Now the irony here is that in actuality, the sales and the deals that you get on these
[11:07.400 --> 11:13.800]  Black Friday sales aren't even as good as sales that you could find throughout the year.
[11:13.800 --> 11:15.960]  For items that you actually want.
[11:15.960 --> 11:20.000]  Most of the time, I mean, I've seen people fighting over a vegetable steamer.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.800]  I mean, fighting over the most ridiculous things in a store because it's on sale.
[11:25.800 --> 11:27.880]  It must be a good deal.
[11:27.880 --> 11:34.040]  Now what's interesting here is people are supposed to be spending time with their families.
[11:34.040 --> 11:40.120]  Thanksgiving is about being thankful for your family, thankful for the things that you have
[11:40.120 --> 11:42.040]  in your life.
[11:42.040 --> 11:47.520]  Thankful for your neighbors, your friends, your family, for the food on your table.
[11:47.520 --> 11:53.320]  It's about people getting together in unity and spending time together, being thankful
[11:53.320 --> 11:54.760]  for spending time together.
[11:54.760 --> 12:04.600]  Nowadays, we have all of these big corporations completely taking over and hijacking Thanksgiving.
[12:04.600 --> 12:09.240]  Thanksgiving is going to no longer be about having a turkey dinner, spending time with
[12:09.240 --> 12:15.040]  your family, staying indoors and your neighbors coming over and everyone sitting around the
[12:15.040 --> 12:19.320]  fireplace talking, being thankful that family's in town.
[12:19.320 --> 12:25.520]  No, now Thanksgiving is going to be about being thankful for that vegetable steamer that
[12:25.520 --> 12:31.480]  you stole out of someone's hand and that you have now achieved, you have now taken and
[12:31.480 --> 12:35.160]  gotten this amazing deal on Black Friday.
[12:35.160 --> 12:36.160]  So I just want to show you.
[12:36.160 --> 12:39.400]  I mean, this is ludicracy here.
[12:39.400 --> 12:47.480]  I went around Walmart, Target, the malls around here, and it's kind of all the same thing
[12:47.480 --> 12:48.480]  right now.
[12:48.480 --> 12:51.440]  You see a good amount of cars in the parking lot.
[12:51.440 --> 12:54.360]  You don't really see any lines anymore.
[12:54.360 --> 13:01.720]  On Black Friday, you used to see tons of people lining up outside of stores, camping.
[13:01.720 --> 13:08.600]  And nowadays, today, I'm just seeing people are already in shopping on Thursday, on Thanksgiving.
[13:08.600 --> 13:13.160]  The day they're supposed to be spending time with their family, they're in there buying
[13:13.160 --> 13:19.200]  gifts for Christmas or buying gifts or items that they might not even need.
[13:19.200 --> 13:26.880]  Some people will buy like three different, three big LED, high definition TVs that you
[13:26.880 --> 13:28.960]  don't even need, but wow, it's such a great deal.
[13:28.960 --> 13:31.440]  I'm going to grab it so that somebody else can't have it.
[13:31.440 --> 13:38.240]  You see, these big corporations advertise to you all during the day on Thanksgiving.
[13:38.240 --> 13:41.320]  Usually when people are watching football or sitting down and watching TV while they're
[13:41.320 --> 13:45.120]  waiting for their Thanksgiving dinner, they advertise, you've got to get this deal.
[13:45.120 --> 13:46.120]  Go to Macy's.
[13:46.120 --> 13:47.120]  Go to Walmart.
[13:47.120 --> 13:48.120]  Go to Target.
[13:48.120 --> 13:49.120]  Go to the mall.
[13:49.120 --> 13:50.120]  You have to have this.
[13:50.120 --> 13:51.120]  You have to have that.
[13:51.120 --> 13:52.120]  Right?
[13:52.120 --> 13:53.120]  We have the best sales.
[13:53.120 --> 13:57.760]  And if you don't go out there and get them now, well, you're losing and everyone else is
[13:57.760 --> 13:58.760]  winning.
[13:58.760 --> 14:02.200]  They're willing to go out and fight for their items.
[14:02.200 --> 14:07.440]  They're going to get the best deals, deals that you can only get once a year.
[14:07.440 --> 14:13.720]  Well, that's been researched and it has been proven to be incorrect.
[14:13.720 --> 14:19.200]  The deals on Black Friday aren't even that great, aren't even that special of deals.
[14:19.200 --> 14:21.400]  You can find those deals throughout the year.
[14:21.400 --> 14:26.560]  In fact, you could probably find better deals online.
[14:26.560 --> 14:32.840]  And many people have started actually shopping online for Black Friday or for what people
[14:32.840 --> 14:38.240]  call Cyber Monday, which is the Monday following Thanksgiving weekend.
[14:38.240 --> 14:43.480]  Which by the way, if you are one of the people who aren't going to be ruining your Thanksgiving
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.920]  by going out here and shopping and trying to get these Black Friday deals, then you
[14:48.920 --> 14:55.560]  might want to spend some time on infowarstores.com and stock up on some of our awesome products
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.120]  that we have on sale for special on Black Friday.
[14:59.120 --> 15:04.120]  Because why go out here and fight the frenzy, fight the chaos, you know, step out of the
[15:04.120 --> 15:12.400]  house and away from your family when that's not what Thanksgiving is all about.
[15:12.400 --> 15:16.440]  Thanksgiving is supposed to be about family and neighbors.
[15:16.440 --> 15:17.440]  Absolutely.
[15:17.440 --> 15:18.440]  And enjoying a meal together.
[15:18.440 --> 15:23.600]  The full report by Millie Weaver is up on infowarstores.com and there she was out on Thanksgiving
[15:23.600 --> 15:30.280]  evening documenting that report live that we just reared parts of here.
[15:30.280 --> 15:35.480]  By the way, we've got a report of stampede in London and shots fired.
[15:35.480 --> 15:37.680]  So we'll see if that's an Islamic attack.
[15:37.680 --> 15:42.640]  We've seen Nigeria bombing 50 killed in early morning attack on Mosque, religion of peace
[15:42.640 --> 15:43.640]  strikes again.
[15:43.640 --> 15:49.480]  But nowhere in these articles does it say Islam and Sinai Mosque attack kills 235 in
[15:49.480 --> 15:52.960]  Egypt, but nothing to do with Islam.
[15:52.960 --> 15:59.520]  If you say that in Germany, you'll be arrested because Islam is totally peaceful.
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.120]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[16:01.120 --> 16:05.880]  I'm talking thick meaty, center cut, presidential bacon, savory and delicious.
[16:05.880 --> 16:06.880]  I buy some.
[16:06.880 --> 16:07.880]  I use some.

[18:59.960 --> 19:06.320]  I want to plow into all of this but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[19:06.320 --> 19:12.720]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[19:12.720 --> 19:19.960]  or videos or other material from infoorstore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[19:19.960 --> 19:24.880]  I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[19:24.880 --> 19:25.880]  at infoorstore.com.
[19:25.880 --> 19:29.560]  I don't want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[19:29.560 --> 19:34.720]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that.

[19:38.640 --> 19:45.680]  dad, colloidal silver and iodine as well, infowarslife.com or triple-A-253-3139 and
[19:45.680 --> 19:50.080]  your purchase of the products stands with us, stands with America, stands with Trump,
[19:50.080 --> 19:53.920]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are
[19:53.920 --> 20:02.200]  and they know we know who they are and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[20:02.200 --> 20:11.840]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:11.840 --> 20:35.840]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:35.840 --> 20:44.440]  The story broke on Tuesday that we covered at infowars.com but I wanted to go back to
[20:44.440 --> 20:45.440]  it today.
[20:45.440 --> 20:54.560]  If you look at the image of the North Korean military officer trying to flee in a jeep,
[20:54.560 --> 21:00.200]  in a truck to the demilitarized zone on the border with the south and having scores of
[21:00.200 --> 21:07.440]  soldiers boil out like ants out of an ant hill, out of a pill box, out of a bunker and
[21:07.440 --> 21:13.520]  fire more than 40 shots, five of them hitting him as you see South Korean soldiers on the
[21:13.520 --> 21:17.640]  flare footage dragging him away to safety.
[21:17.640 --> 21:22.360]  We can go ahead and roll the footage if you like for TV viewers.
[21:22.360 --> 21:30.160]  And when you witness the video shot by the United Nations that's in control of the DMZ,
[21:30.160 --> 21:39.800]  it really gives you a bird's-eyed view into just how hellish countries like North Korea,
[21:39.800 --> 21:44.480]  Venezuela, Cuba really are.
[21:44.480 --> 21:50.320]  And the fact that this guy was an officer and had dozens of different types of parasites
[21:50.320 --> 21:56.640]  in him including parasites that aren't usually in humans.
[21:56.640 --> 22:02.080]  Now it's well known that the North Korean military eats the poop of the inner party
[22:02.080 --> 22:03.360]  leaders.
[22:03.360 --> 22:07.920]  So that's another reason they've got so many parasites is they literally live off the
[22:07.920 --> 22:11.240]  feces of the higher ups.
[22:11.240 --> 22:16.280]  I'm not kidding they cook it but obviously he wasn't cooking his, I don't mean to be
[22:16.280 --> 22:24.640]  gross here, there's almost no bugs or birds in the north, it is a literal hellhole.
[22:24.640 --> 22:29.040]  And even Vanity Fair 20 years ago had a big story about one of the reporters there who
[22:29.040 --> 22:35.000]  noticed that even in the middle class areas they're tiny, they were selling dead children
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  smoked meat as the only meat.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.640]  So there's the flare footage, you're a TV viewer, of them dragging the North Korean
[22:42.640 --> 22:49.480]  military officer risking his life shot five times.
[22:49.480 --> 22:56.240]  You see the trail of blood there that shows up as white on the black background as he's
[22:56.240 --> 22:57.600]  drug away.
[22:57.600 --> 23:03.120]  Now compare that to people in the United States, the Antifa folks, the Liberals, the Socialists,
[23:03.120 --> 23:10.440]  the BLM folks that have their smartphones, their designer shoes, their designer clothing,
[23:10.440 --> 23:14.000]  you've done reports on it looking at the average garb of one of these people, they'll be wearing
[23:14.000 --> 23:20.140]  $400, $500 worth of clothing, they'll have a $600 smartphone in their hand, many times
[23:20.140 --> 23:27.320]  I see them get out of nice Jaguars, Mercedes, you name it, to go out and do their demonstrations
[23:27.320 --> 23:32.680]  and hit people in the head with bike locks and they're calling for the take down of America
[23:32.680 --> 23:40.760]  and free market and they hate this country and all they do is celebrate any problems
[23:40.760 --> 23:46.120]  we've had and basically exaggerate those problems and then make it look like the West is the
[23:46.120 --> 23:51.520]  most evil thing in world history.
[23:51.520 --> 23:59.120]  It shows what communism and socialism and authoritarian systems create, poverty, shortages,
[23:59.120 --> 24:00.120]  bondage.
[24:00.120 --> 24:04.920]  Now you could argue, well North Korea's had horrible sanctions on it for decades, well
[24:04.920 --> 24:09.800]  the Soviet Union had long lines for food and a lot of malnutrition and problems as well
[24:09.800 --> 24:14.960]  despite the fact their population had high IQs, South Korea is incredibly prosperous,
[24:14.960 --> 24:19.000]  they have some of the highest IQs in the world, some of North Koreans but they're under an
[24:19.000 --> 24:30.680]  authoritarian regime and that is the fount, that is the headwaters, that is the place
[24:30.680 --> 24:42.360]  from which all of this floods, that's where it comes from and then you compare that with
[24:42.360 --> 24:48.760]  the West where the poorest people in this country live like kings compared to North
[24:48.760 --> 24:51.520]  Koreans or people in Venezuela.
[24:51.520 --> 24:55.000]  Venezuela now has malaria outbreaks across the country because they can't even buy or
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.880]  produce the anti-malarial drugs, they long since ate their pets and their farm animals,
[25:02.880 --> 25:10.000]  now cannibalism is popping up, black plague is back, leprosy is back, drug resistant TB
[25:10.000 --> 25:16.760]  is there, they are cursed despite the fact that Venezuela per capita, check it out for
[25:16.760 --> 25:22.960]  yourself in the World Almanac, has five times the resources per square mile that the United
[25:22.960 --> 25:33.360]  States does, rich volcanic soil, rainforest, fields, valleys, ocean, diamonds, rubies,
[25:33.360 --> 25:43.520]  emeralds, gold, silver, rare earth minerals, incredible fauna, flora, but it's a hellhole,
[25:43.520 --> 25:49.680]  it's a hellhole and it's the same thing again and then you see spoiled rotten brats, the
[25:49.680 --> 25:55.560]  other end of the extreme of the North Korea, you see all these people lined up on the day
[25:55.560 --> 26:02.040]  before Black Friday when the Black Friday sales historically at stores are some of
[26:02.040 --> 26:06.760]  the worst of the year, there's major reports on that, they jack up prices then they lower
[26:06.760 --> 26:13.440]  them on that day when a month before you could have bought them for a better deal, by the
[26:13.440 --> 26:17.880]  way our Black Friday specials are always the best we offer right through the year, we have
[26:17.880 --> 26:22.480]  some other big specials as well, obviously in December this is the season for that but
[26:22.480 --> 26:30.840]  we have 50% off dozens of our best selling items, free shipping, store wide, X2, 67%
[26:30.840 --> 26:37.560]  off colloidal silver, silver bullet right on that, brain force 50% off right now, limited
[26:37.560 --> 26:42.560]  edition t-shirts, only four days left to get the anti-fascist, anti-communist shirt, we're
[26:42.560 --> 26:45.720]  going to start doing the shirt of the months that are only available for one month, it
[26:45.720 --> 26:53.560]  is the best seller, 25% off the water filtration systems and so much more at infowarslife.com
[26:53.560 --> 27:02.160]  or infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139, but I'm done plugging there, the point is you
[27:02.160 --> 27:06.880]  juxtapose thousands of iPhone cases and hundreds of smart phones and hundreds of different
[27:06.880 --> 27:10.960]  types of televisions and tens of thousands of different types of medicine and all these
[27:10.960 --> 27:16.280]  giant movie production houses and news and radio and textile plants and thousands of
[27:16.280 --> 27:23.560]  choices of religion and just all the things we have and there's the other extreme of having
[27:23.560 --> 27:30.160]  so much, we don't appreciate it and spoiled rotten brainwash teenagers and young people
[27:30.160 --> 27:35.600]  are taught by the big government run, big corporate finance, taxpayer finance schools
[27:35.600 --> 27:41.360]  that America and freedom and free market is horrible and has bad inequity and is an evil
[27:41.360 --> 27:47.800]  system and that socialism, communism and authoritarianism is this wonderful bed of roses, if we could
[27:47.800 --> 27:52.280]  just realize it here, it'd be so wonderful.
[27:52.280 --> 27:57.880]  The truth is the big mega rich globally, finance communism, created communism and socialism
[27:57.880 --> 28:03.120]  and they put it into countries, they want to damage and implode, have a period of revolution
[28:03.120 --> 28:08.600]  and within 5 to 10 years they come in, depose who they first put into power to erect society,
[28:08.600 --> 28:13.840]  to end free market, to end the old structures for social engineering, then they come in
[28:13.840 --> 28:19.720]  with phase two, then they start reforming it over the next decade like communist China
[28:19.720 --> 28:25.560]  and make it a bifurcated true class society with the ultra rich inner party of the communist,
[28:25.560 --> 28:32.000]  all worth billions of dollars apiece with a giant suboid slave class under them control.
[28:32.000 --> 28:36.120]  That is the true globalist model, according to Zbigniew Brzezinski, according to Carol
[28:36.120 --> 28:41.560]  Quigley, according to Al Gore, according to Obama when he would go to South America and
[28:41.560 --> 28:45.840]  teach them that, you got big mega banks and they interface with you that will be communist
[28:45.840 --> 28:53.200]  and it's going to be great, they're all sitting there nodding their heads, we'll be back with
[28:53.200 --> 28:59.200]  massive key reports, I'm Alex Jones, stay with us.

[29:29.160 --> 29:33.160]  Most people think life insurance pays after you're dead, that's true, but did you know

[29:37.760 --> 29:41.360]  You can use the life benefits of your life insurance to grow your money with certainty

[30:01.200 --> 30:05.680]  America is an information based civil war, that's why now more than ever, we've got
[30:05.680 --> 30:10.480]  to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down
[30:10.480 --> 30:16.200]  from their bullying, we're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe
[30:16.200 --> 30:17.200]  dictatorship.
[30:17.200 --> 30:23.920]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[30:23.920 --> 30:30.800]  the counterculture, the real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism
[30:30.800 --> 30:34.360]  and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant.
[30:34.360 --> 30:39.640]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism, they are
[30:39.640 --> 30:40.640]  the anti-liberalists.
[30:40.640 --> 30:46.240]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide, we've got more
[30:46.240 --> 30:52.280]  than 60 original designs of high quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot
[30:52.280 --> 30:59.720]  Feral at infowarstore.com, be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[30:59.720 --> 31:05.480]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically,
[31:05.480 --> 31:11.320]  spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb with populations
[31:11.320 --> 31:18.360]  and globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds, things are getting crazy.
[31:18.360 --> 31:22.760]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet, we've also got to have rearguard actions
[31:22.760 --> 31:23.760]  to be prepared.
[31:23.760 --> 31:27.920]  The number one thing, I forget to rhyme with God, is to have high quality storeable food.
[31:27.920 --> 31:33.080]  Well, the entire line of my Patriot supply foods, private labeled as infowar select,
[31:33.080 --> 31:39.920]  is now 50% off, I've only done that one time before previously, 50% off, you cannot beat
[31:39.920 --> 31:45.040]  that, and we're only doing that through Cyber Monday, so it starts today on Thanksgiving

[31:57.080 --> 31:59.200]  off, take action today.
[31:59.200 --> 32:07.000]  I'm driving home here, about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving, and I just want
[32:07.000 --> 32:11.080]  to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate you and how
[32:11.080 --> 32:17.160]  thankful I am, and I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking
[32:17.160 --> 32:21.760]  action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely
[32:21.760 --> 32:27.560]  taken over not just this country but other nations, and globalism is a completely anti-individual,
[32:27.560 --> 32:36.960]  anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate
[32:36.960 --> 32:42.640]  and control society, and that we have come so far with God's help, and have turned the
[32:42.640 --> 32:47.600]  tide with the enemies tracking back, so just please, we should all be so thankful to God
[32:47.600 --> 32:52.200]  and thankful to each other for taking action, but also, girt ourselves and get ready for
[32:52.200 --> 32:57.200]  the next big fight ahead, because history is happening, so for myself and my family,
[32:57.200 --> 33:00.800]  God bless you all, have a great Thanksgiving.
[33:00.800 --> 33:22.560]  You are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:22.560 --> 33:26.880]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[33:26.880 --> 33:33.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:33.880 --> 33:38.960]  Okay, I'm going to get into Black Friday.
[33:38.960 --> 33:43.360]  I'm going to get into your phone calls, the latest on George Soros, the latest on the
[33:43.360 --> 33:47.280]  economy, the Islamic attacks intensifying around the world.
[33:47.280 --> 33:52.800]  We've got shots fired at a central tube station in London about 30 minutes ago.
[33:52.800 --> 33:56.840]  All we know is there's a bunch of people stampeding, and there's been a bunch of injured reported
[33:56.840 --> 34:02.680]  because of that, so pray for folks there, but big Islamic coordinated terror attacks across
[34:02.680 --> 34:03.680]  the world.
[34:03.680 --> 34:09.240]  We're going to be covering that coming up more as we learn more throughout the four
[34:09.240 --> 34:18.520]  hours of broadcast today, but before I go any further, let me get into a piece that I'm
[34:18.520 --> 34:24.120]  about to play here that is so riddled with disinformation, I'm tempted to make a whole
[34:24.120 --> 34:33.400]  hour long special on it, just to illustrate how deceptive it is.
[34:33.400 --> 34:45.760]  It's a Vox article in an AV Club story, AV Club video, attacking Sean Hannity saying
[34:45.760 --> 34:53.360]  he's a conspiracy theorist for talking about Seth Rich, even though Donna Brazil says he's
[34:53.360 --> 34:58.160]  right and it was probably a political murder, that's the former head of the DMC, and that
[34:58.160 --> 35:02.200]  there's no shadow government and nobody trying to remove Trump from office, even though we
[35:02.200 --> 35:09.920]  have Schumer on TV saying, we'll take you down, we have seven ways to Sunday in the
[35:09.920 --> 35:14.320]  intelligence agencies, and all these articles in Atlantic Monthly in New York are saying,
[35:14.320 --> 35:18.320]  the deep state's permanent, we're going to remove you, and before Obama left in January
[35:18.320 --> 35:21.840]  of this year, he said, don't worry, we've had to stay behind groups in government that
[35:21.840 --> 35:25.440]  are dug in, that are going to block the Trump agenda, and that was in the New York Times,
[35:25.440 --> 35:35.880]  but they shit their preying on their yuppie audience, knowing that they're lying to them,
[35:35.880 --> 35:40.280]  knowing and hoping that they haven't gone and researched this, and it's not that Sean
[35:40.280 --> 35:47.080]  Hannity's even copying me, he's quoting what the globalist have said, so they're in their
[35:47.080 --> 35:50.720]  news articles calling for their overthrow of Trump in deep state, but then when we say
[35:50.720 --> 35:54.760]  that's wrong, they go, oh, you're crazy, it doesn't exist, just like the antifa uprisings,
[35:54.760 --> 36:00.160]  they said they'd have November 4th, doesn't mean that we're wrong when they weren't big
[36:00.160 --> 36:03.960]  uprisings, they had full page ads, they said it was going to happen, they're failures,
[36:03.960 --> 36:09.760]  but we're right in reporting what they did, there's also all these calls for violence
[36:09.760 --> 36:13.680]  against Trump and against conservatives and people being attacked and shot and everything
[36:13.680 --> 36:21.040]  else, I mean, we know this is going on, but they have this individual, again, engaged
[36:21.040 --> 36:27.680]  in total fantasy, the perfect beta male, and he pretends that Hannity's throwing a football
[36:27.680 --> 36:32.600]  at him being mean, and of course you know it's fantasy, but he's mixing it with like
[36:32.600 --> 36:41.080]  he's being a serious journalist, it's just incredibly deceptive, then he says, masculinity
[36:41.080 --> 36:47.920]  is a cage, so he's got that doubling down on this whole agenda, where we see fathers
[36:47.920 --> 36:52.920]  and men being demonized everywhere, and coming up, we've got all the pedophilia being promoted
[36:52.920 --> 36:57.840]  by YouTube and Google, they've got big sponsors pulling away, big arrest of child traffickers
[36:57.840 --> 37:01.480]  happening, Catholic Church's caught in more trouble, and the media, Meanwhile's running
[37:01.480 --> 37:06.560]  headlines saying Trump's crazy, Jones is crazy, there's no pedophiles, and none of them are
[37:06.560 --> 37:10.360]  being arrested, even though they're being arrested by the thousands a month, and you
[37:10.360 --> 37:15.920]  see mainstream media being apologists for it saying it isn't a problem, it isn't happening,
[37:15.920 --> 37:24.760]  it's made up, and Alex Jones needs to be sued to stop him from saying it, and the New York
[37:24.760 --> 37:29.600]  Times comes out and says, Joe Biden didn't grope in kids on video, shut Alex Jones down,
[37:29.600 --> 37:36.200]  when we got hours of it, there it is, Trump's mythical crap down on sex trafficking, boy
[37:36.200 --> 37:41.400]  you read the headlines every day, it's like 100 arrests the last two days, I got a stack
[37:41.400 --> 37:49.520]  of them right here, Colorado child sex traffickers sentenced to 472 years in prison, top brands
[37:49.520 --> 37:56.160]  pull YouTube ads over pedophilia fears, Skynish, Google acts as this tasteful survey that
[37:56.160 --> 38:03.160]  asks users to choose an image of the child they like best for pedophilia behavior, Daily
[38:03.160 --> 38:08.200]  Mail, you can't make this up, there's an epidemic of it in the Catholic church, an epidemic
[38:08.200 --> 38:12.760]  at universities, an epidemic in secondary schools and primary schools, there's an epidemic
[38:12.760 --> 38:18.760]  in government, there's an epidemic in juvenile detention centers, there's an epidemic in
[38:18.760 --> 38:24.680]  Hollywood, there's an epidemic and people have the courage to go public now, so the
[38:24.680 --> 38:29.800]  media's spinning it like, oh and men kissing women, a man at a Christmas party trying to
[38:29.800 --> 38:35.240]  kiss a girl he likes, she says no, that's rape, no that's what mammals do, he keeps
[38:35.240 --> 38:40.240]  doing it then it is harassment, go to your boss, he grabs you, call the police, but
[38:40.240 --> 38:48.840]  instead calls for sleeping beauty to be banned because Prince kisses princess with consent,
[38:48.840 --> 38:53.880]  without consent, because she's in a trance, that's her true love, that's the whole point,
[38:53.880 --> 39:03.880]  now it's rape, see a prince kissing a princess is now the same thing as pedophilia, there
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.480]  it is, mother calls for sleeping beauty to be banned from primary school as it promotes
[39:07.480 --> 39:12.120]  inappropriate behavior, yeah inappropriate behavior as a man and a woman together, that's
[39:12.120 --> 39:19.400]  what's being targeted here, so I'm gonna start to stop this video with again, talk about
[39:19.400 --> 39:24.160]  discrimination, everybody that works at Daily Beast, Vox, they even test their blood to
[39:24.160 --> 39:28.720]  see if their test is too high, then they privily say you've got the test of a woman, they then
[39:28.720 --> 39:37.280]  celebrate it, and they go masculinity's a cage, ban it, get rid of it, this is a cult folks,
[39:37.280 --> 39:42.400]  you know a cult cause it's organized, it's focused, it is top down, it is vertically
[39:42.400 --> 39:47.120]  integrated and it follows sex systems and is obsessed with what language you use and
[39:47.120 --> 39:51.040]  how you look and they always want to restrict language and then make everybody be freaked
[39:51.040 --> 39:57.040]  out about the language, so again here they are demonizing Sean Hannity and listen, they
[39:57.040 --> 40:01.640]  got shows on Discovery Channel and History Channel that attacked me and Comedy Central
[40:01.640 --> 40:07.200]  and NBC and ABC and CBS, I don't even ever cover those, this is so interesting because
[40:07.200 --> 40:14.840]  it's such bull, it's such clear lies, everything he says that Hannity's saying is a conspiracy
[40:14.840 --> 40:20.920]  theory, he's a documented fact, like Hillary when she headed up the State Department did
[40:20.920 --> 40:26.200]  get authorization for Uranium One, the criminal investigation by Mueller got closed, Mueller
[40:26.200 --> 40:33.320]  closed the investigation, but he just says it isn't true, that's how amazing these people
[40:33.320 --> 40:35.800]  are, so let's go ahead and go to this report, here it is.
[40:35.800 --> 40:41.680]  A very important message tonight, please stop smashing your curing coffee machines.
[40:41.680 --> 40:46.680]  What the f**k is happening here, why is Sean Hannity the most recognizable face on Fox
[40:46.680 --> 40:54.560]  News, making his viewers to stop smashing their curings, it's a weird story and it's
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.840]  what happens when the loudest pro-Trump voice on Fox News decides to go full conspiracy
[40:59.840 --> 41:00.840]  theorist.
[41:00.840 --> 41:05.680]  This is news, information and truth, I promise you can't get anywhere else in the media.
[41:05.680 --> 41:12.680]  If you are lucky enough to not know who s**t is, so what they're saying, what they're
[41:12.680 --> 41:18.520]  doing here is very simple, when you get hot, when you get on target, when you know what
[41:18.520 --> 41:22.600]  you're talking about, when you start really discussing the real issues that are happening
[41:22.600 --> 41:29.640]  in policy papers, instead of just pop news, then the word is conspiracy theorist, created
[41:29.640 --> 41:36.400]  by the CIA in 1965 as declassified, that term is meant to discredit anybody that's covering
[41:36.400 --> 41:40.400]  real news or asking questions they don't want to be looked at.
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.640]  So again, he says if you're lucky enough to not know who he is, here's who he is, just
[41:44.640 --> 41:49.360]  all kinds of dissension for people that don't have friends, don't have family, they're alone
[41:49.360 --> 41:53.000]  as Facebook documents show, who were there just desperately wanting to feel like they're
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.680]  part of a club, part of the cool winning group, well they reach out and watch this guy to
[41:57.680 --> 42:00.480]  feel like they're part of a club, here he is.
[42:00.480 --> 42:03.680]  Think of him as Trump's permanent spokesman on Fox News.
[42:03.680 --> 42:10.160]  President Trump, he's moving very fast to fix the country and keep his promises to you.
[42:10.160 --> 42:14.960]  He goes on to say this is a lie, conspiracy theory, biggest stock market ever, 1.6 million
[42:14.960 --> 42:19.360]  new jobs, hundreds of billions of new investment, over a thousand major companies have come
[42:19.360 --> 42:25.280]  back, jobless numbers, the lowest they've been since 1984, do I have to list all the
[42:25.280 --> 42:31.080]  accomplishments again, but here they are cheerleading against the economy, trying to imply that
[42:31.080 --> 42:36.440]  nothing's happened, that we didn't hit 3.1 percent growth rate, something they said
[42:36.440 --> 42:37.440]  was impossible.
[42:37.440 --> 42:42.520]  When we come back, we're going to go through this piece as judiciously as I can, but it's
[42:42.520 --> 42:50.120]  just all lies from a condescending guy who stereotypically looks anorexic with a bunch
[42:50.120 --> 42:53.640]  of earrings in and then he tells you he doesn't like masculinity.
[42:53.640 --> 43:00.200]  He declares that that's the enemy, watch, it's coming up.
[43:00.200 --> 43:05.280]  I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding our operation by

[47:02.120 --> 47:28.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:28.120 --> 47:45.700]  So, we're about to get to this piece of pure lies and total deception that anybody can
[47:45.700 --> 47:51.360]  research for yourself and just see that it is a giant piece of disinformation lies.
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.280]  How Trump turned Sean Hannity into a conspiracy theorist.
[47:56.280 --> 48:00.360]  Why he was the only person in mainstream news that the courage to cover Seth Rich, that
[48:00.360 --> 48:01.720]  murder being political.
[48:01.720 --> 48:04.720]  Now Donna Brazils come out and agrees with him.
[48:04.720 --> 48:09.520]  He was the first guy in mainstream news to cover the left openly plotting in their publications
[48:09.520 --> 48:15.160]  to overthrow the president, something they admit, but this cook gets up there and says
[48:15.160 --> 48:19.040]  there's nothing to uranium one, it's all lies, everything.
[48:19.040 --> 48:27.440]  And then he attacks the fact that Sean Hannity is a toxic male and that it's a cage to be
[48:27.440 --> 48:32.920]  masculine and pretends that Sean Hannity is physically attacking him acting like he's
[48:32.920 --> 48:34.520]  throwing a football at him.
[48:34.520 --> 48:39.840]  And look, I know it's obviously fantasy, but he's mixing it together with reality so he
[48:39.840 --> 48:43.240]  can make these aggressive false accusations.
[48:43.240 --> 48:49.240]  So if you want to learn how to be a disinfo cuck who wants to be an alpha, a beta, who
[48:49.240 --> 48:53.960]  sees strong men as telling the truth as a threat to him, and who wants to pull that
[48:53.960 --> 49:00.080]  down, who wants to create a society of cucks to rule over men and rule over truth, here
[49:00.080 --> 49:01.080]  it is.
[49:01.080 --> 49:09.080]  And I ask you again, how do we let packs of these beta bullies do this to us?
[49:09.080 --> 49:12.480]  Will we let them conquer us is the question.
[49:12.480 --> 49:16.920]  Here's Sean Hannity, Trump's permanent spokesman on Fox News.
[49:16.920 --> 49:21.480]  President Trump, he's moving very fast to fix the country and keep his promises to you,
[49:21.480 --> 49:22.480]  the American people.
[49:22.480 --> 49:24.040]  Kind of a running joke at this point.
[49:24.040 --> 49:27.440]  Trump could nuke the rainforest and Hannity would be like President Trump.
[49:27.440 --> 49:29.760]  Once again, doubling down on draining the swamp.
[49:29.760 --> 49:37.400]  That diehard loyalty has made Hannity one of Trump's favorite media personalities again.
[49:37.400 --> 49:39.000]  They say that kind of loyalty.
[49:39.000 --> 49:44.000]  They nuke the rainforest, and you can say it's a joke, but they hide behind this thing.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.440]  Just like the late night comics, it's all BS.
[49:47.440 --> 49:49.000]  Trump has been delivering, continue.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  You're so great, and I'm very proud of you.
[49:55.000 --> 49:59.960]  But it's also turned Hannity into cable news's biggest conspiracy theorist, because as Trump's
[49:59.960 --> 50:04.540]  White House has been hit with bigger and bigger scandals, Hannity's had to turn to wackier
[50:04.540 --> 50:08.440]  and wackier stories to distract his viewers.
[50:08.440 --> 50:09.440]  Let's pause again.
[50:09.440 --> 50:14.720]  He's had to turn to wackier and wackier stories like Seth Rich and Uranium One, which he all
[50:14.720 --> 50:17.480]  covered first on national TV.
[50:17.480 --> 50:20.960]  We of course covered it before that, which has all been vindicated, but this is what
[50:20.960 --> 50:22.400]  they do when you're vindicated.
[50:22.400 --> 50:27.440]  They come out and create alternate realities and then claim that we're in an alternate
[50:27.440 --> 50:28.440]  reality.
[50:28.440 --> 50:29.440]  Hey, dude.
[50:29.440 --> 50:30.440]  We've all been vindicated.
[50:30.440 --> 50:31.440]  Let's continue.
[50:31.440 --> 50:32.440]  Man, I'm doing my job.
[50:32.440 --> 50:35.560]  Hannity's favorite conspiracy theory is his deep state.
[50:35.560 --> 50:40.320]  Deep state leaks, a deep state that has been leaking on you.
[50:40.320 --> 50:41.320]  Trump said it was coming.
[50:41.320 --> 50:42.560]  He leaked on him, said it was a deep state.
[50:42.560 --> 50:43.560]  It's all come out to be true.
[50:43.560 --> 50:47.360]  It's all turned out Obama did it, turned out Obama was spying on him.
[50:47.360 --> 50:50.000]  All vindicated, vindicated, vindicated, vindicated.
[50:50.000 --> 50:51.280]  But you can't stand that.
[50:51.280 --> 50:55.400]  So the whole thing is about going after his sponsors so they can show this video to
[50:55.400 --> 51:02.160]  adult sponsors and go, oh, look, the young trendy with no viewers, you know, just attacked
[51:02.160 --> 51:04.520]  Hannity, we better dump our advertising.
[51:04.520 --> 51:05.520]  That's all this is.
[51:05.520 --> 51:07.280]  In fact, they even admit that later.
[51:07.280 --> 51:11.640]  They say, we've tried to shut down all of Showns, but it hasn't worked because he sells
[51:11.640 --> 51:16.400]  his own products, but don't worry, they're trying to shut those down too.
[51:16.400 --> 51:17.400]  So let's continue.
[51:17.400 --> 51:18.400]  Here it is.
[51:18.400 --> 51:19.400]  Urban agents are secretly conspiring.
[51:19.400 --> 51:20.400]  All right, pause.
[51:20.400 --> 51:21.400]  Back that up.
[51:21.400 --> 51:22.400]  10 seconds.
[51:22.400 --> 51:27.400]  Even Politico, your own God, because it's Cruz putting articles over this for radio
[51:27.400 --> 51:29.760]  listeners, says the deep state's real.
[51:29.760 --> 51:31.280]  See, you've lost the fight.
[51:31.280 --> 51:35.880]  World government's real, deep state's real, fluoride causing brain tumors and bone tumors
[51:35.880 --> 51:36.880]  is real.
[51:36.880 --> 51:38.160]  Lower ITUs is real.
[51:38.160 --> 51:40.480]  You don't get it.
[51:40.480 --> 51:42.520]  CNN and everybody knows they've lost the fight.
[51:42.520 --> 51:47.880]  So Politico and CNN have to admit, I'm right now about fluoride, about world government.
[51:47.880 --> 51:53.120]  You're a rearguard action with the trendies who are all addicted to soy lattes and wonder
[51:53.120 --> 51:55.160]  why they're so depressed, soy boys.
[51:55.160 --> 51:58.080]  And this is a soy boy rearguard action.
[51:58.080 --> 52:01.440]  You know how Hitler had the Hitler Youth Rearguard Action?
[52:01.440 --> 52:06.920]  They sent out their little kids to fight the Russians and the U.S. and the allies.
[52:06.920 --> 52:09.360]  This is their rearguard action, literally.
[52:09.360 --> 52:11.840]  How weird is this in bizarro world?
[52:11.840 --> 52:14.720]  Their rearguard action is soy boy.
[52:14.720 --> 52:15.720]  Let's continue.
[52:15.720 --> 52:19.320]  The deep state, deep state leaks, deep state that has been leaking on you.
[52:19.320 --> 52:23.640]  The beliefs that government agents are secretly conspiring to sabotage Trump and remove him
[52:23.640 --> 52:24.640]  from office.
[52:24.640 --> 52:30.080]  An unelected part of your government looking to overturn the results of a duly elected president.
[52:30.080 --> 52:31.960]  They tried to block the primary.
[52:31.960 --> 52:34.520]  They tried to block him being seated with the electors.
[52:34.520 --> 52:36.880]  They tried to block him on inauguration day.
[52:36.880 --> 52:40.720]  They physically tried to block me for three hours getting in to see the inauguration.
[52:40.720 --> 52:43.200]  Then said nobody was there.
[52:43.200 --> 52:44.400]  They've had congressional hearings.
[52:44.400 --> 52:48.920]  There's the Hill admitting that they unmasked Trump and were listening and watching him.
[52:48.920 --> 52:49.920]  There it is.
[52:49.920 --> 52:52.320]  Manafort Wiretap shows deep state is real and dangerous.
[52:52.320 --> 52:53.320]  The Hill.
[52:53.320 --> 52:58.080]  What's vindicated am I?
[52:58.080 --> 53:02.520]  You see, meanwhile Congress says shut me down, shut off info wars.
[53:02.520 --> 53:03.520]  Let's continue.
[53:03.520 --> 53:07.920]  Let's go back to the best the deep state can dish up, beta boy.
[53:07.920 --> 53:08.920]  Here he is.
[53:08.920 --> 53:12.160]  Long been a talking point for conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones.
[53:12.160 --> 53:13.800]  We're in a war with the deep state.
[53:13.800 --> 53:15.720]  But Hannity has brought it mainstream.
[53:15.720 --> 53:17.520]  They're planning a hot coup.
[53:17.520 --> 53:18.680]  The soft coup is the buildup.
[53:18.680 --> 53:20.200]  A soft coup is underway.
[53:20.200 --> 53:23.720]  They're a clear and present danger running around inside our country.
[53:23.720 --> 53:26.560]  And what is becoming now a clear and present danger?
[53:26.560 --> 53:30.840]  Now Sean Hannity has said what I've been warning you of word for word.
[53:30.840 --> 53:33.200]  Hannity has also been a major voter.
[53:33.200 --> 53:36.880]  See, this was their major miscalculation.
[53:36.880 --> 53:41.240]  They thought branding Trump with me would hurt Trump.
[53:41.240 --> 53:45.840]  Trump knew that I was only teaching what his dad taught and what he knew before I was born.
[53:45.840 --> 53:49.040]  And it was now time for America to come back.
[53:49.040 --> 53:54.080]  And they knew that branding Trump with info wars was what they were looking for, was all
[53:54.080 --> 53:57.800]  done very strategically, fools.
[53:57.800 --> 54:01.840]  We sat around and discuss it before we did it, Dumbo, looking into the future.
[54:01.840 --> 54:06.040]  As great men do, we saw what cucks would do later.
[54:06.040 --> 54:11.920]  And you still think branding Trump with me is hurting him.
[54:11.920 --> 54:12.920]  It's not.
[54:12.920 --> 54:17.600]  It's the magic secret sauce.
[54:17.600 --> 54:20.800]  They actually think having co-bear and all these idiots get up on TV and lie about me
[54:20.800 --> 54:21.800]  hurts me.
[54:21.800 --> 54:24.240]  They're universally hated by thinking people.
[54:24.240 --> 54:33.200]  All it does is validate what we've done and what we stand for.
[54:33.200 --> 54:35.120]  Even the New Yorker magazine says it's useless.
[54:35.120 --> 54:36.120]  It's not hurting.
[54:36.120 --> 54:37.120]  It doesn't work anymore.
[54:37.120 --> 54:39.880]  Why did they're getting rid of Charlie Rose and everybody they knew about his sexual
[54:39.880 --> 54:40.880]  harassment?
[54:40.880 --> 54:42.440]  They're doing it because it didn't work.
[54:42.440 --> 54:45.440]  That's why the media fought so hard to get rid of Trump the last year because they had
[54:45.440 --> 54:47.320]  to prove that they were valid.
[54:47.320 --> 54:49.040]  They had to prove they had teeth.
[54:49.040 --> 54:53.000]  They had to prove they were an attack dog that could get the job done.
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.360]  Well, guess what?
[54:55.360 --> 54:57.640]  We didn't just stomp that dog down.
[54:57.640 --> 55:02.280]  We killed that dog.
[55:02.280 --> 55:06.560]  So you got that and I know you got your stay behind networks and you got stuff in the
[55:06.560 --> 55:07.560]  works.
[55:07.560 --> 55:08.560]  Things going to shut us down.
[55:08.560 --> 55:12.360]  It's going to make us bigger because the sweeping giant is awake because the big dog
[55:12.360 --> 55:14.120]  just got off the porch.
[55:14.120 --> 55:17.680]  Move over a skinny dog because the fat dog's moving in.
[55:17.680 --> 55:19.560]  It's called prosperity.
[55:19.560 --> 55:21.400]  Let's continue back with the video.
[55:21.400 --> 55:23.080]  The Uranium One story.
[55:23.080 --> 55:24.960]  The corrupt Uranium One deal.
[55:24.960 --> 55:30.000]  It's a conspiracy theory that claims Hillary Clinton helps sell Uranium to the Russians.
[55:30.000 --> 55:31.000]  That's all they've got.
[55:31.000 --> 55:32.200]  She did help do it.
[55:32.200 --> 55:33.720]  Mueller brought it on the tarmac.
[55:33.720 --> 55:35.160]  It was totally illegal.
[55:35.160 --> 55:37.640]  She was at the State Department and got waivers for it.
[55:37.640 --> 55:42.400]  But he has that one word and then he dresses like a clown who's anorexic.
[55:42.400 --> 55:48.800]  So if you're anorexic clown that goes like this all the time, then you've got to be
[55:48.800 --> 55:49.800]  listening.
[55:49.800 --> 55:50.800]  Here, let's go back to it.
[55:50.800 --> 55:53.480]  In exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation.
[55:53.480 --> 55:57.640]  It's a bad theory that's been debunked repeatedly, including by Fox News.
[55:57.640 --> 56:00.880]  The accusation is predicated on the charge that's...
[56:00.880 --> 56:08.360]  Oh, it's on Shep Smith, the in-house globalist Lemmy Winks of Fox News.
[56:08.360 --> 56:17.640]  Lemmy Winks, the brave gerbil that was willing to burrow into Fox News.
[56:17.640 --> 56:24.000]  The bravest attention of our times, Shepard Lemmy Winks Smith.
[56:24.000 --> 56:25.000]  All right.
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.880]  I'm going to come back and play the rest and I'm going to give a number to all of the
[56:27.880 --> 56:34.360]  news and Black Friday videos and the George Soros and just all the rest of it briefly.
[56:34.360 --> 56:38.320]  At the end of the video, they go, the answer is shutting down Sean Hannity sponsors.
[56:38.320 --> 56:41.840]  You've got to get Sean Hannity off the air and he goes, you know, that's why we've taken
[56:41.840 --> 56:43.720]  all of Alex Shones as sponsors.
[56:43.720 --> 56:47.200]  That's why he's got to sell debunked male vitality pills.
[56:47.200 --> 56:48.200]  Oh, yeah.
[56:48.200 --> 56:53.640]  That's why on third-party sites, they've got 6,000, 7,000, 10,000 reviews saying unbelievable.
[56:53.640 --> 56:58.960]  I mean, in my 40-year checkup, the doctor said, you got any problems in the bedroom?
[56:58.960 --> 56:59.960]  I said, no.
[56:59.960 --> 57:03.040]  He said, hey, how about some agra?
[57:03.040 --> 57:04.040]  How about some Seattleists?
[57:04.040 --> 57:05.520]  We just give it to everybody at 40.
[57:05.520 --> 57:06.520]  Just try it.
[57:06.520 --> 57:07.520]  You know, the doctors push that stuff.
[57:07.520 --> 57:08.520]  I said, sure.
[57:08.520 --> 57:09.520]  I'll try it.
[57:09.520 --> 57:14.600]  Well, the agra made me see blue and didn't really change anything.
[57:14.600 --> 57:19.000]  And the Seattleists made me more excited more times a day.
[57:19.000 --> 57:20.000]  Okay.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  I'm just telling you.
[57:21.000 --> 57:27.520]  Me personally, super male vitality or things like anthroplex, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy, Lordy,
[57:27.520 --> 57:28.520]  Lordy, Lordy.
[57:28.520 --> 57:29.520]  Yeah.
[57:29.520 --> 57:31.440]  91% reviews on third-party sites.

[57:41.480 --> 57:43.200]  But X2 is a super miller about stamina and energy.
[57:43.200 --> 57:44.720]  Labito is a side effect.

[01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:08.080]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:11.080]  the Infowar.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:17.320]  So, I got so much news.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.640]  Why am I spending several segments on this?
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.360]  It's because it's so formulaic.
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:31.880]  You've got somebody trying to look trendy who looks like an emaciated culture war victim,
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.880]  a soy addict.
[01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:34.880]  We've tracked these people.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.480]  They all on their own pages say, I drink soy, I concentrate soy, I love soy, I'm addicted
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480]  to soy.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:48.240]  They're addicted to literal female hormones and he even announces he's against masculinity
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.040]  at the end of it.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:54.360]  And he's lying about Sean Hannity, pillar to post.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.880]  He doesn't want me to exist.
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:58.280]  He doesn't want you to exist.
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.440]  He wants cultural dominance and he can't believe he doesn't have it.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:05.040]  So, he's got to lie about Hannity and say, Hannity's lying.
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:06.720]  The economy's not doing well.
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:08.840]  There's no Uranium One scandal.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.640]  There's nothing going on, on and on and on.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:16.920]  And then he just tattles on Hannity's sponsors as part of the arrested development and then
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.120]  just hopes they can get rid of him.
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:21.360]  Hey, Fox already tried to have a purge.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.040]  They lost half their revenue.
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.520]  They lost half their viewers.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.360]  Now they're going back to patriot, even more hardcore and their ratings are coming back
[01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:29.360]  up.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:32.960]  So, little news flash, you lost the election.
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:33.960]  You failed.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:37.800]  You've thrown everything you can at myself and everybody else and the audience sees through
[01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:43.640]  it and is rallying behind us and you are failing, Lord Cuck, King of the Cucks, you
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.640]  are failing.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:47.160]  Let's continue with Cuck, Lord.
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:53.280]  The accusation is predicated on the charge that Secretary Clinton approved the sale.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:54.280]  She did not.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:56.200]  But that hasn't stopped Hannity from- She did not.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:00.280]  According to one study, Hannity spent three and a half hours on the story over the course
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:01.280]  of three weeks.
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:03.960]  If you're ever standing- By the way, let me pause again.
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.680]  I mean, it's all over the illegal servers and the illegally emails we've got, not to
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.480]  mention the 35,000 missing, that they would have emails.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:11.760]  I gave you a million dollars.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.400]  Okay, you get the meeting next week.
[01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.880]  Well, I want another meeting.
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.880]  We'll give another million.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.120]  I mean, it's blatantly illegal.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.720]  She thought she'd get into office to cover her butt with executive immunity.
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:22.720]  It didn't happen.
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:24.600]  You just closed your foundation.
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:26.800]  You're collapsing.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.600]  And you leave this rearguard action here.
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:32.800]  You leave the lights on to make folks think you haven't run off down the back road.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.000]  And you leave this Cuck again as your scorched earth.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  Let's continue.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.600]  This is probably time to reevaluate your life choices.
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.760]  There's a ton of other Hannity conspiracy theories.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:47.200]  The Clinton email stuff, these are very serious crimes, saying James Comey should be arrested,
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:51.240]  Comey's possible criminal conduct, accusing Robert Mueller of trying to protect Hillary
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.240]  Clinton.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240]  He shut it down.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.800]  There's no way the American people can trust.
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.800]  This is all true.
[01:02:55.800 --> 01:03:01.440]  To investigate anything Russian-related.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:02.440]  Throw up, man.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.880]  Hannity is now the leading conspiracy theorist on cable news, and there's data to prove it.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:07.880]  My name is Alvin Chang.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:08.880]  I'm a senior reporter.
[01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:09.880]  I'll hit pause.
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:12.280]  It's always about how they're into science.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:19.520]  Oh, look, keywords like Seth Rich in Deep State, Hannity said it the most of anybody on TV.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.520]  So that scientifically proves it's a conspiracy theory because he's the one trailblazing on
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:28.920]  mainstream news covering topics that are now being proven to be correct.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:35.840]  It's like saying, I covered Jones covers webcams watching you the most in 20 years.
[01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:38.560]  But was I right about webcams watching you?
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:43.000]  But because he covered them the most, it shows he's the most wrong.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.480]  Jones covered the fact that Trump was going to be president the most.
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:51.360]  Our computer analysis shows that he said that the most.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.360]  And he is the president.
[01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.880]  But again, they play these little scientific games that kind of like, wow, the little latte
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.480]  addicts, the little soy addicts sitting in their mommy's basements that Hillary talked
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.840]  about in WikiLeaks, how much she hated men living in their mommy's basements.
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:06.840]  Here, let's go.
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.840]  Let's go back to this.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.280]  I'm interested in how Sean Hannity used conspiracy theory on it.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:19.040]  Why is every one of the guys on any liberal media like, hello, I'm here, I'm a scientist.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.840]  Are you impressed with me?
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.840]  I did a computer program.
[01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:27.720]  I mean, can we have any men?
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:32.560]  Can we have any men on any of these shows that are able to talk?
[01:04:32.560 --> 01:04:33.560]  Any of them?
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:34.920]  I mean, where do they all go?
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.400]  Do you have to like try to call?
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:40.280]  Can I get a job with you and probably work for free like you do?
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:44.320]  And I went like, hello, everybody, I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.920]  I did a scientific report here.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:53.760]  And I heard the mainstream media said conspiracy theorists, trillions of times, does that make
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.760]  it true?
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:59.320]  We'll be right back, see what we mean.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.240]  America is an information-based civil war.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:05.960]  That's why now more than ever, we've got to hit the streets of America and let these
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:09.600]  globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bully.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:15.960]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:21.960]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:22.960]  the counterculture.
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:29.640]  The real punk rock is being a patriot whose pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom,
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.440]  who at the same time is tolerant.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:37.240]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:42.600]  They are the anti-liberalists who defend free speech, meet like-minded friends, and promote
[01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:43.600]  freedom worldwide.
[01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:49.120]  We've got more than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:52.760]  well as more Patriot Feral at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:52.760 --> 01:06:20.560]  Be part of the Second American Revolution at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:30.560]  So, they've got shows on Comedy Central, three of them at least, that attack me every week
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:35.520]  or every weeknight, like The Opposition, I've only watched it one time, and I'm told every
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:40.440]  day they're attacking us, I don't even cover it, it doesn't even matter.
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:48.000]  But AV Club, along with Vox, has come up with some super deceptive sludge.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.840]  So my point is, I don't cover the big national news shows that attack us, even when Colbert
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:52.840]  does a lot now.
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:57.600]  I don't cover it, because we have a bigger audience than they do.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:03.000]  Our audience is sick of hearing about them, but looking at the next wave of bottom feeders
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:07.680]  like this guy, I'm finishing up with this and getting into other news, is just incredible
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.560]  where they say, Sean Hannity's a liar, the economy's not doing well, Sean Hannity's
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.200]  a liar, there's no uranium.
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.200]  One scandal, Sean Hannity's a liar, the Clinton Foundation didn't do anything, Hillary's
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:24.720]  email server wasn't illegal, it was admitted to be illegal.
[01:07:24.720 --> 01:07:31.240]  The deep state doesn't exist, Chuck E. Schumer never said, the deep state's gonna get you.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:35.120]  And then they cut to another guy, I mean why do all the men on the report like, they all
[01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:43.680]  do this little fake look where they try to act confidently, they're like, and they again
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:50.680]  all talk like, yes, I mean gosh, look at this Sean Hannity, this toxic male, it's a caged
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:57.680]  Sean, come out of that, Sean Hannity's copying Alan Jones, oh my gosh, he's gonna kick off
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:04.640]  the radio, what is Fox gonna do, everyone let's tattle, let's tattle, he's talking about
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:09.160]  Seth Rich saying it might have been a political murder, of course he's been totally validated
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:15.840]  as Info Wars has been, now that Dona Brazell has come out, but this has been in response
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:22.800]  to all that, they just go on in their alternate reality claiming we're in an alternate reality.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:28.560]  Listen here, I'm the one that predicted Trump was gonna win, I expose the fake polls, and
[01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:33.880]  I expose basically everything else, and the McMaster news two months ago, bottom bad mouth
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:41.120]  in trouble at that dinner party, and the JFK files and everything else, I put it all out,
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:46.760]  so you've got a big problem, and again they think when I attack them, I'm attacking them
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.880]  because they're big and powerful and effective, AV Club had some other thing they wrote about
[01:08:51.880 --> 01:08:57.480]  last week with some horrible actor kid with the worst writing I've ever heard, and we
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:05.200]  made fun of it, and so they ran headlines, Jones is really upset by this, Jones is really
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:12.600]  on his knees because this 10 year old kid is doing a spoof of him, let me explain something,
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:22.200]  I love people spoofing us, I love memes, I love being made fun of, I love it, that's
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:27.320]  how we get the young audience, it's how we grow, it's been your biggest miscalculation,
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:34.520]  but you are so arrogant that you still haven't figured out that when I tell you I love being
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:43.440]  attacked, you think you're Machiavelli and that's me trying to trick you to stop attacking,
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:48.120]  it's you people really are stupid, just because your robber baron grandparents took over the
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:55.000]  world and then now kind of put you in charge, it's like watching morons rearrange deck chairs
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:05.360]  on the Titanic, don't you understand that your losers, your pathetic, that the Facebook
[01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:11.440]  documents say we want beta males alone by themselves desperate and scared that we control
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:15.960]  with fake bots and fake communities, and we want the women the same, and we want women
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.360]  to look like men, and men to look like women to confuse the sexes, to absolutely break
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:26.960]  up the order of the sexes of mammal operations so we can come in and end the family as you
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:32.120]  know it and overwrite it with a corporate takeover and that's the plan and it's declassified
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:37.680]  and then you have the very victims of it up here calling for Sean Hannity to be taken
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:46.640]  off the air because he's a liar and the whole thing is an exercise in just a pathetic jibbering
[01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:52.160]  person reading off a teleprompter pretending like he's in a fight with Sean Hannity and
[01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:57.720]  Sean Hannity's trying to assault him for the childlike minds watching it to have a simulated
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:01.760]  victory because they want a simulated victory because they don't live in the real world
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:06.480]  and Hillary was in the WikiLeaks saying that about the emasculated men living in their
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:12.120]  mother's basements drinking soy milk, she said that about you word for word because
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:17.400]  she's part of the program that did it to you, let's continue.
[01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:19.880]  My name is Alvin Chang, I'm a senior reporter at Fox.
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:25.320]  I was interested in how Sean Hannity used conspiracy theories on his Fox News show.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:32.080]  I went to Reddit's conspiracy forum and I wrote a computer program to get the top 1,000
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.080]  posts.
[01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:36.080]  I categorized what the conspiracies were about and I came up with this.
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:37.760]  This is the OCD power trip too.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:42.160]  I went to Reddit that puts it all in its own digital get out and calls a conspiracy if
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:46.760]  you question official lies and then I calculated it all on a computer to have numbers which
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:52.120]  made me feel powerful over it so I could then show you numbers I had to show how bad Hannity
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:56.320]  is that he kept saying that Seth Rich was probably politically murdered which is now
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.360]  basically being confirmed or that Uranium One that's admitted has been confirmed or
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:04.680]  that deep states that's all been confirmed or illegal spying on Trump or illegal leaking
[01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.320]  that's all been confirmed.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.200]  What do we do when info works is so untarget and has all these sorts and now Sean Hannity
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:11.200]  is mainlining it?
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:15.120]  Well, we just have a nerd that appeared in Act All Powerful in an appeal to authority
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:19.200]  so all the other nerds who are into seeing like old vintage equipment behind me, that's
[01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:21.920]  my call to authority, they all think I'm God now.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:22.920]  Let's go back to it.
[01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:27.720]  I came up with about 100 different conspiracies that I could search for.
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.120]  Seeing in fake, that's a meme we launched.
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.440]  Clinton Foundation, that just doesn't even exist, that's a conspiracy.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:35.360]  WikiLeaks, that isn't even real.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:41.720]  Assange isn't real, Madonna Brazil isn't real, Uranium One isn't real, look, they're
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:45.600]  telling you Clinton and the Uranium scandal isn't real, deep state isn't real, this is
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.800]  on screen, Clinton collusion isn't real, CNN and fake news isn't real, Clinton corruption
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]  isn't real.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.360]  How about Clinton Bad Health, that isn't real too, right?
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:56.360]  All coming out.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:13:03.920]  Clinton Foundation, WikiLeaks, Assange, I mean, sky's blue, isn't real, we're nerds,
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:09.200]  we drink soy, we don't like you, we are God, do what we say, let's continue.
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.560]  Transcripts, when we looked at the data, it turns out Hannity, far and away, makes the
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:16.320]  most accurate theories more than every other news person.
[01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:18.000]  And that guy is wide marching.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:19.240]  Don't think this is a coincidence.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:23.720]  Hannity's not just a typical right wing pundit anymore, he's moving into Alex Jones territory
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.080]  and unsurprisingly, Jones has noticed too.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.760]  I love it, let's show Hannity shows now the Alex Jones show.
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:34.200]  But unlike Alex Jones, who uses conspiracy theories to sell survival gear and bogus male
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.200]  supplements.
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.200]  Pause again.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:41.760]  No, we sell survival gear and high quality verified supplements because we're funding
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.640]  this mission to defeat you.
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:48.480]  See, revolutionaries raise money to overthrow the tyranny, not to have the money.
[01:13:48.480 --> 01:13:53.120]  If I wanted the money, I'd have joined the establishment, dumbass, let's continue.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.280]  Ultimate male vitality supplement.
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:14:00.720]  That was a satire piece we did, but notice they hide behind satire, back it up 10 seconds.
[01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:04.680]  They hide behind satire to put out their lies.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:10.120]  Then they show our admitted satire while I fly through the ceiling to then say we're
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.120]  fake.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:14.160]  So see, they use satire to act like they're real.
[01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:16.680]  We use satire to illustrate things to be funny.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:23.120]  And they jump back and forth with total intellectually bankrupt fraud against their victim viewers.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.120]  Let's continue.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.440]  We have developed ultimate male vitality supplement.
[01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:31.960]  Kennedy uses conspiracy theories to protect Trump, to distract away from stories that
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:32.960]  damage the White House.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:38.160]  I charted it out when he brings these up over time, and it seemed like conspiracy theories
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:42.120]  were mentioned most when Trump was going through some kind of scandal.
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.360]  None of that is related to President Trump.
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.360]  None of it.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:46.960]  Zero is related to his campaign.
[01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:51.640]  That's right, the Manafort deal, none of it is connected.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:54.480]  It's from 10 years ago.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.920]  The Podestas are involved in some of the same stuff.
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:57.920]  Probably isn't even illegal.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.920]  It's some filing.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.920]  He paid the taxes.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:01.920]  Again.
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.960]  Then they never give you substance of what they're talking about.
[01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.080]  They just say it's a lie.
[01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:06.080]  Let's continue.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.000]  Kennedy mentioned conspiracy theories in those times.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  They're spiked.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.920]  And they're related to the news of the day.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:15.120]  They're related to the scandals that the Trump administration is going through.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:18.720]  Fox's best defense of this stuff is that Kennedy isn't a real journalist.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:21.840]  He's an opinion host, so what he says doesn't really matter.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.000]  But that distinction between news and opinion is rarely clear on Fox.
[01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:27.880]  Look at the way Kennedy introduces these segments.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:31.120]  We're going to come back and finish up.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:34.480]  Notice how they're doing satire, but acting like they're real.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:37.360]  When Kennedy is real, they're saying he isn't real.
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:42.160]  Then they use him saying, well, I wear the hat of a pundit, but also a journalist.
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:44.840]  And they go, oh, look, he isn't a journalist.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.840]  Playing games.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:47.240]  This is the anatomy of deception.
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:51.960]  I'm spending so much time on this, not because it's important by itself, but together it's
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:57.440]  a great educational tool to understand the anatomy of con artists.
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:16:02.480]  Katie Armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market.

[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.600]  ID stronghold wallets are different.
[01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:03.520]  They may look the same on the outside.
[01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.520]  They're stylish.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:08.440]  They'll hold your cards in cash, but they're hiding something great on the inside.

[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.320]  Not a group you develop living defense for us.
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:01.720]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:03.440]  Why is this so good?
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:07.880]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:12.760]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:13.760]  my system.
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:19.000]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.800]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:26.880]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.160]  going on everywhere.
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.160]  These are all parasites.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.840]  Tell us about all the stuff you said, there's so many things that are in it.
[01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:36.200]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.480]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:40.480]  All right.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.640]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.640]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslives.com.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:49.480]  And folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:52.760]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslives.com.
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.960]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:59.240]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:05.400]  I'm driving home here, about to take off for a few days for Thanksgiving.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.000]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.440]  you and how thankful I am.
[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.440]  And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't there taking action, and
[01:19:17.440 --> 01:19:21.520]  if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely taken over not just
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.120]  this country but other nations.
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:31.080]  And globalism is a completely anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:38.200]  that is just pure power-cult will to dominate and control society.
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:42.440]  And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide, but the enemy's
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:43.440]  tracking back.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.840]  So just please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:48.840]  action.
[01:19:48.840 --> 01:19:53.840]  But also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is
[01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:54.840]  happening.
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:20:00.200]  So for myself and my family, God bless you all, have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:20.440]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:26.200]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:20:26.200 --> 01:20:28.200]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:33.800]  Yeah, and we know that Vox, whatever that is, just constantly puts out the weirdest fiction
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.800]  about me.
[01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:38.960]  By the way, they're now reporting, thank God, no shots fired in London, I guess the wicked
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:43.240]  flee when done pursues, just a mass hysteria.
[01:20:43.240 --> 01:20:46.360]  Now continuing, ladies and gentlemen, just finishing up with this and I'm going to give
[01:20:46.360 --> 01:20:47.360]  the number out and take your calls.
[01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.680]  We do have some guests coming up with breaking news and a bunch of news I haven't gotten
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:58.680]  to yet, I don't normally spend four or five segments on one seven and a half minute video.
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:08.360]  It's just such lies that they say the Clinton Foundation is a conspiracy theory, just the
[01:21:08.360 --> 01:21:09.360]  foundation itself.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:16.800]  So let's go ahead and finish up here it is between news and opinion is rarely clear on
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.800]  Fox.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:47.360]  I have soft hands, more importantly, advertisers don't care about that distinction.
[01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:52.120]  Who conspiracy theories in particular have spooked Hannity's advertisers in May, Hannity
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:57.280]  started peddling the story that former DNC staffer Seth Rich was murdered after leaking
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:03.080]  emails from the DNC.
[01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:07.640]  I thought there was more to that video.
[01:22:07.640 --> 01:22:13.360]  I watched it this morning, I guess we don't have the end of it, let's redownload it because
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:17.560]  one way or another, we're going to air it today.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:22.320]  Oh no, there's an exciting conclusion, it's like seven and a half minutes long going after
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:28.920]  his sponsors shutting him down, how they've tried to shut me down, but how we sell our
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.120]  own products so they're unable to do it, so now they're going after the products.
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:35.960]  It's no big deal, we download a lot of videos, but I've never made such a big deal out of
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:42.640]  a video as I am today, I'm just on this long riffing jazz style rant on that subject so
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:48.400]  we will redownload it or we'll live stream it, we'll just spend the rest of the show
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:51.720]  on this one video.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:58.320]  But getting back to this deception, it shows you their entire game plan and what they're
[01:22:58.320 --> 01:23:05.000]  about and what they're doing and how they lie and where they come from to sit there
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:13.240]  and say, Sean Hannity's bad for covering Seth Rich and that it's a conspiracy theory
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:19.280]  to say maybe he was killed for political reasons, here's some news articles right here, vindicating
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:24.640]  what we first reported on, what he reported on, what others reported on, Donna Brazil
[01:23:24.640 --> 01:23:34.000]  reveals paranoia over Russian spying on her, snipers peering through her window, that's
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:38.960]  how the media spun it, Donna Brazil says she feared for her life after Seth Rich was
[01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:41.760]  killed.
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:46.200]  All Hannity said was we should investigate it, he was the head IT guy over the emails,
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:50.640]  he had a bunch of foreigners working in there from Pakistan over the servers, you had them
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:58.120]  ordering the Democrats via the Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the FBI and J. Johnson at Homeland
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:05.480]  Security not to get into the DMC computers 22 times, you had the long history of the
[01:24:05.480 --> 01:24:13.840]  dead bodies, the string out behind the Clintons, but their answer is to tell everybody that
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:22.040]  it doesn't exist, to simply put it doesn't exist.
[01:24:22.040 --> 01:24:30.720]  But you know, since they're demonizing us for selling products, I just want to remind
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:36.600]  the listeners that they've kicked us off Google ads, they've kicked us off ad roll, they've
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:41.640]  kicked us off all sorts of platforms and they've tried to shut us down and it is an act of
[01:24:41.640 --> 01:24:46.600]  defiance for real, you can't buy products anywhere that are going to hurt the globalist
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.040]  as bad as doing it here.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:54.560]  And we also sell high quality products at very, very affordable prices.
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:25:02.440]  So there's really no brainer when it comes to this, it is a total 360 win.
[01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:07.400]  So I just want to encourage all the listeners today on Black Friday to take advantage undoubtedly
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:12.120]  of one of the best sales we've done in the last several years, 67% off on high quality
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:17.320]  colloidal silver with all of its great uses, 50% off on brain force, our best selling product
[01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:21.320]  that's now back in stock for a limited time, that's unprecedented.
[01:25:21.320 --> 01:25:29.400]  We have limited edition fascism, anti-fascism, anti-communist shirt that will no longer be
[01:25:29.400 --> 01:25:34.040]  sold as soon as it sells out, we've got just a few days left of that, 50% off the good
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:39.760]  halogen X2, the opposite of fluoride in the body, absolutely critical, that's 50% off,
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:44.000]  that has a 98% review level.
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:51.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, out of 5,929 reviews on power reviews, it is our highest reviewed
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800]  product.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:59.160]  Nobody else has the deep earth crystal source iodine that we have an X2, again the thyroid
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:08.400]  fills up with the bad, the bad iodine that can be radioactive, it fills up with the other
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:13.000]  bad halogens, it fills up with the bromide, the bromine, the fluoride, the chlorine and
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:19.360]  a bunch of others, but if it has the good iodine, it doesn't, and it's such a game-changer,
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:22.480]  but it can have big effects on you if your thyroid was already out of shape, so be sure
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:29.160]  and consult a physician before you do it, but if you search engine, IQs went up 15 points
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:34.960]  after the feds started putting a little bit of a, not very good form, but still better
[01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:41.280]  than nothing iodine into the salt, in the 30s, they stopped it in the 70s, IQs went
[01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:46.520]  up 15 points on average when they did that, so that's just an example of how you die without
[01:26:46.520 --> 01:26:49.240]  vitamin C, but that's all over the place.
[01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:53.360]  Iodine is a lot rarer in the environment, and through iodine that isn't already bound,
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:58.400]  that you can actually absorb, through atomic iodine, that just means pure iodine, that
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.520]  is absolutely critical, you know, when they tested a bunch of our products trying to find
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.800]  impurities in the first big round and found no impurities, they got really upset, it was
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.880]  an easy prediction of what would happen after that, you know, if they failed, these type
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:14.360]  of folks, what would they do when they tested our products and found nothing wrong, and
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.120]  they said, this is very strange, they said, are the spectrometers in the lab we use, so
[01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:23.680]  this is just iodine, it's not potassium, it's not sodium, it's just iodine, they didn't
[01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:31.480]  know what a profound statement that was, how hard we worked, they were telling you 999999,
[01:27:31.480 --> 01:27:35.560]  that you have to get DEA approval on, you have to keep in a locked facility because
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:40.600]  of what you can use pure iodine for in processing, but under law they can't keep you from getting
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:44.640]  in if you've got a legitimate source for the reason you're selling it, we had to get DEA
[01:27:44.640 --> 01:27:50.080]  approval five years ago to even be able to have this, the iodine we have, you put it
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:55.640]  out in the open air, turns purple and like I dream of genie and turns into purple gas,
[01:27:55.640 --> 01:28:05.560]  we've got video of that, so again ladies and gentlemen, true iodine, atomic iodine, not

[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.520]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now, more than ever, we've got
[01:31:03.520 --> 01:31:08.320]  to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down
[01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:14.040]  from their bullying. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe
[01:31:14.040 --> 01:31:20.800]  dictatorship. Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:27.560]  is truly the counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America,
[01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:33.200]  pro-capitalism and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:39.120]  a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberalists.
[01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:44.000]  To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.080]  than 60 original designs of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot

[01:31:57.440 --> 01:32:03.080]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically,
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:09.000]  spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb with populations
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:16.120]  and globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds. Things are getting crazy.
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.120]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rear-guard
[01:32:20.120 --> 01:32:24.840]  actions to be prepared. The number one thing, I forget to rhyme with God, is to have high-quality
[01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:29.360]  storeable food. Well, the entire line of my Patriot supply foods, private-labeled as
[01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:35.960]  InfoWars Select, is now 50% off. We've only done that one time before previously. 50%

[01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:51.720]  there. It's the full spectrum of my Patriot. It's private-labeled by us, totally fresh,
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:59.240]  less 25 years, 50% off. 50% off. Take action today.
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:09.240]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:26.240]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want to stop tyranny? Well,
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:33.120]  so does he. Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:39.520]  Okay, I rarely spend an hour. And I've spent an hour now, from the middle of the last hour
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:44.920]  to now, getting into this box video piece, because I can take a minute of video and stop
[01:33:44.920 --> 01:33:51.960]  it 10 times when it's full of lies, to cover each lie. This one is such a deception that
[01:33:51.960 --> 01:33:56.920]  it just makes my head spin. And you tie it in with the congressional reports where they
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:34:01.720]  want to shut InfoWars down, and they really let you know their model here, where they're
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:07.760]  like, well, Hannity's got sponsors. You know, we got rid of Jones' sponsors, but now he
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:13.440]  sells his own product. So what do we do? Well, we know what you've been doing. And it just
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:19.320]  shows what horrible mercenaries these individuals are and how hell-bent they are on trying to
[01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:25.000]  defeat this country. But here's the good news. Without me even looking, I've got stacks of
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:35.840]  news articles. NFL Rating Slide is getting worse with no end in sight. Just since three
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:43.000]  years ago, they've lost over 50% of their viewers. They are now the most unpopular sport in America
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:52.720]  in pulse of the national sports. It has the worst favorability rating. Don't you get it?
[01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:58.480]  Everything you touch turns to crud. America and the world is awake. We're never going
[01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:02.440]  back. We're never giving in. And we know your secret. You've got our kids in the schools.
[01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:07.160]  I'm getting to that next. And you think you're going to brainwash them, but every study shows
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:16.040]  Generation Z is the most libertarian Americana conservative generation in over 100 years.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:23.180]  Don't you know that some of the little too extreme Christian stuff to kids made them
[01:35:23.180 --> 01:35:28.400]  rebel and turn into devil worshipers? What's going to happen when the devil worshipers
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:32.440]  try to make the kids devil worshipers? It's going to make them be Christians. And all
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:38.000]  the polls show that young people are pro life, 75%. They're anti globalist. They love the
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:47.160]  show and I'm not bragging. It is humbling when I go to another school function to pick
[01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:51.800]  up one of my daughters at somebody else's school, not just the school they go to and
[01:35:51.800 --> 01:35:57.800]  the young people from ages eight to like 15, just point and go, it's Alex Jones. All of
[01:35:57.800 --> 01:36:03.160]  them want photos. I get mobbed everywhere by young people. I was at a P Terry's hamburger
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:09.040]  place about a month ago and I literally could not eat my food. It was like I was Elvis Presley.
[01:36:09.040 --> 01:36:14.600]  People were like, oh, it's incredible. And then more groups were coming in of high schoolers
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:22.800]  and I was mobbed and couldn't eat. And there were leftist in there. Nobody was in there
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:26.880]  when I first walked in except five high schoolers and they all shook my hand and got photos.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:29.960]  I got my food, went to sit down after work. I was hungry at like five o'clock. I was going
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:35.240]  to eat a second dinner. Mama was making it like eight o'clock. I go in, shake their
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:40.480]  hand, take photos, go sit down. So he left us talking crap about me. The whole family
[01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:44.600]  had been run over by a truck, but they were the elitists. There he is laughing at me all.
[01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:47.240]  I even heard him go, look, he's alone. You don't have any family. That's the thing they
[01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:51.200]  always say. They were all celebrating on Twitter. Look, he's alone on Thanksgiving wasn't even
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:54.960]  trills with all my children. It doesn't matter to them. It's like a weird because that's who
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:59.360]  they are. They want to project their loneliness on me. I'm not happy. They've been atomized
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:04.240]  and made alone. Makes me sad, but it shows their mindset to celebrate that. Oh, look,
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:08.400]  he's a loser like us. And all of a sudden, just the whole place just got filled with
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:12.840]  like 20 high schoolers and they were, they were, they were Asian and they were Indian
[01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:17.120]  and they were white and they were, they were waspy because it was, you know, upper middle
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:21.840]  class area and they were Alex Jones. We love you. We love this. We love that. We were watching
[01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:25.560]  today. We were watching yesterday. Oh, it's awesome. Everybody loves you. Oh, come speak
[01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:30.080]  at my school. Click, click, click photo, photo. Okay. That group more came in this time about
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:35.040]  your girls. They run over and I'm just like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. And the leftist all
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:38.680]  got up and they left and walked by on the guy, walked by me like he was going to bump
[01:37:38.680 --> 01:37:46.600]  into me. He had plenty of room and he was just because he understands, dude, you're
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:53.520]  not cool. This thing from Vox, this isn't cool. I'm not trying to be cool. I want freedom.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:59.400]  I'm real. People know that. That's what's cool. The victory is cool. Turning the world
[01:37:59.400 --> 01:38:03.440]  around is cool. Believing in humanity is cool. Believing in our young people is cool. Not
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:07.640]  trying to turn them into wasteland, you know, globalists in a deindustrialized country.
[01:38:07.640 --> 01:38:10.960]  That's what's cool. And that's what upsets you because you're losing your grip. So you
[01:38:10.960 --> 01:38:16.200]  try to tighten it harder and just like a beaten woman, we're out of your life. So now they're
[01:38:16.200 --> 01:38:20.360]  shifting to pure culture war to cover up from the real crimes they're committing. We'll
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:24.920]  get to that in a moment, but let's finish up with a piece. Here it is. In May, Hannity
[01:38:24.920 --> 01:38:30.120]  started peddling the story that former DNC staffer, Seth Rich, was murdered after leaking
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:34.960]  emails from the DNC to WikiLeaks. Now, if true, this could become one of the biggest
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:40.240]  scandals in American history and could mean that Rich could have been murdered under very
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:45.920]  suspicious. I created a pants on fire, snopes debunked it. Even Fox News retracted its article
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:50.800]  about it, but Hannity continued spending segment after segment suggesting that Clinton operatives
[01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:55.680]  were somehow involved in Rich's murder. If this is true, this blows the whole Russian
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:39:00.600]  collusion narrative completely out of the water. It got so bad that Rich's brother
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.680]  begs Hannity's executive producer to stop him. Okay, let's stop right there. Let's stop
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:14.640]  right there. Since then, this whole coverups collapsed. Since this all happened. This is
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:18.400]  the one story they're trying to say is fake. Dona Brazil's come out and said they think
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:22.720]  he was politically murdered. There's been all this intrigue now inside that office and
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:27.040]  people fleeing the country and people getting indicted and all the rest of it. So since
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:31.920]  Dona Brazil came out, they came out to make it look like he's the big loser. And hidden
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:36.280]  in the story is this one thing that they don't want you to look at Seth Rich or how he was
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.240]  upset that the election was stolen from Bernie Sanders. They don't want Democrats to look
[01:39:40.240 --> 01:39:45.280]  at that because they know that that wakes Democrats up to what happened. So they have CNN saying,
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.760]  oh, please stop. The family first said we've hired a detective. The family first said we
[01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:54.480]  think there may be something suspicious. Once the PR firms, everybody swooped in, they changed
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:59.680]  their story. That's fine. We're sorry for your loss. We as citizens have a right. WikiLeaks
[01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:03.440]  said he was probably their source. They won't say, we're going to look at this. But the
[01:40:03.440 --> 01:40:09.160]  point is, does it just credit Hannity when a high level Democrat operative over IT gets
[01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:13.000]  shot in the back repeatedly and nothing's stolen? And then it turns out Dona Brazil
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:18.720]  is concerned. Doesn't that vindicate Hannity? But is it a conspiracy theory to ask questions?
[01:40:18.720 --> 01:40:19.720]  Let's continue.
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:24.560]  To not cause a grieving family more pain and suffering. And I am not backing off asking
[01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:29.680]  questions even though there is an effort that nobody talked about Seth Rich. Major advertisers
[01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:34.440]  like cars.com pulled their ads from Hannity's show and eventually Hannity back down out
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:40.440]  of respect for the family's wishes for now. I am not discussing this matter at this time.
[01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:44.120]  But on Twitter, he promised he'd keep looking into it, saying, I am closer to the truth
[01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.080]  than ever. Not only am I not stopping, I am working harder. A few months later, Hannity
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:53.280]  spooked advertisers again. When Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who Trump endorsed, was
[01:40:53.280 --> 01:41:01.680]  accused of multiple cases of sexual misconduct, you catch that lie? Trump did not endorse
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:08.680]  Moore. He endorsed Luther Strange. Now he's come out and said, we've seen lies about me.
[01:41:08.680 --> 01:41:13.400]  We haven't seen proof on Moore. So till we see proof, he's not bad. Wow. Innocent will
[01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:18.120]  prove him guilty. Classic Americana. But you catch that last little lie? So many lies coming
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:23.920]  so fast. Trump endorsed Moore. No, he didn't. It was a big scandal. He endorsed Luther
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:25.920]  Strange, liar. Here it is.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:32.280]  How do we ascertain what happened 38 years ago? None of us know the truth of what happened
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.600]  38 years ago. Do people do it for money? Do they do a political reason? Is that more common
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:42.240]  than people would think? Oh, definitely. They will lie to make money. Folks, there are at
[01:41:42.240 --> 01:41:47.760]  least five women I know of in the last 10 years on YouTube saying, I was married to
[01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:51.720]  them and had kids with them. And then my name was all sorts of weird stuff. And people
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:58.240]  asked me, I've had lawyers. I mean, I mean, I've been asked in depositions of somebody's
[01:41:58.240 --> 01:42:05.000]  my wife, who I've never seen or known. I know for a fact, the media has gone and talked
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:09.160]  to those people, but decided they're so stark, raving loon, they don't even put it out. Put
[01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:13.120]  it out. I'm not scared of wherever you make up. The point is in a climate of making stuff
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:16.400]  up, you've got to start questioning. But the whole thing's about getting rid of a sponsor.
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:17.400]  Here it is.
[01:42:17.400 --> 01:42:21.760]  This is a wave of advertiser panic, including from Keurig, which pulled its ads from Hannity
[01:42:21.760 --> 01:42:25.960]  Show. And this time, Hannity lashed out. He retweeted a video of one of his supporters
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:30.240]  smashing their Keurig machines, tweeted a 2015 article about Keurig being covered in
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:35.000]  mold and suggesting he'd give free coffee makers to the best videos he can.
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:36.000]  Yeah, strike back.
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:38.360]  They're smashing their Keurig. Eventually, Hannity backed down again.
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:42.880]  Please stop destroying your coffee machines. But not before advertisers like Volvo and
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.920]  realtor.com suggested they might pull their ads too. Everything about this story is so
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:47.920]  unfair.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:48.920]  Now, they backed off. He won.
[01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:51.920]  Masculinity is a cage. Fox knows what it is.
[01:42:51.920 --> 01:42:52.920]  Masculinity is a cage.
[01:42:52.920 --> 01:42:53.920]  They care about their rights.
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:57.400]  He attacks me next. We're done with this idiot. We'll be back.
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:03.440]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars, biome defense
[01:43:03.440 --> 01:43:11.480]  probiotic. We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality, known probiotics

[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:08.520]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate
[01:45:08.520 --> 01:45:14.760]  you and how thankful I am. And I also just want to reemphasize the point that if you
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:19.640]  weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would
[01:45:19.640 --> 01:45:24.760]  have completely taken over not just this country but other nations. And globalism is a completely
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:31.560]  anti individual, anti God, anti family, anti Christian cancer that is just pure
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:40.280]  power cult will to dominate and control society. And that we have come so far with God's help
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:44.920]  and have turned the tide but the enemy is tracking back. So just please we should all be so thankful
[01:45:44.920 --> 01:45:50.600]  to God and thankful to each other for taking action but also girt ourselves and get ready for the
[01:45:50.600 --> 01:45:56.360]  next big fight ahead because history is happening. So for myself and my family I bless you all have
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:46:01.640]  a great Thanksgiving. Enjoy all natural bath and beauty products with Emmerich's Essentials.

[01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:12.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:24.920]  You want answers? Well, so does he. Live from the info wars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:24.920 --> 01:47:30.440]  And we are go ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us. Coming up the fourth hour,
[01:47:30.440 --> 01:47:36.360]  Mike Sernovich that broke the John Conyers sexual harassment, shipping women in on taxpayer money,
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.840]  you name it. He broke that story exclusively this week.
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:42.440]  Maystere Media was forced to give them the credit to their great harm.
[01:47:43.240 --> 01:47:46.680]  He'll be hosting the fourth hour. I'll host part of that with him. Laura Loomer,
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:54.040]  who received the full tape of Joe Barton, the Texas congressman, sitting a sexually
[01:47:54.040 --> 01:47:59.640]  explicit video to a woman. She got the video. We only showed that we had the video. We didn't show
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:04.760]  the video. We only showed his face to show that we had the video to bring attention to it to say
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:13.000]  that I believed it was revenge porn if it was truly a consensual event and that they're conflating
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:18.040]  consensual activity or men and women kissing or men and women engaging in sexual activity
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:23.640]  as the feminist teach on colleges as rape. That's why it's on info wars.com. They're
[01:48:23.640 --> 01:48:30.040]  calling for sleeping beauty to be banned because the prince kisses the princess without her consent.
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:36.120]  The whole point of is that he was the love that was supposed to be coming and only the true love,
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:41.080]  someone that she'd already seen and thought was handsome that could basically save her.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:46.680]  But now a good wholesome fairy tale is now bad and needs to be banned and radical Muslims
[01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:53.320]  need to be shipped in in mass who cut women's genitals off and throw gays off buildings and
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:58.120]  blow up every church they get their hands on. In fact, today we've got a huge breaking news.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:05.080]  Egypt 200 plus dead as mass attackers gunned down fleeing worshippers.
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:11.640]  235 people on the list is growing. Meanwhile, a Nigerian bombing 50 killed in early morning
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:19.240]  attack on the mosque by Boko Haram, which means no one can teach the teachings of the west. Wow.
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:23.960]  That's like the teachings of Soros and the globalist. No one are their ally with Muslims
[01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.680]  with the radical Islamists. The teachings of the west are forbidden.
[01:49:30.440 --> 01:49:36.280]  True equality, true open society, true tolerance. And then speaking of the cult, this is up on
[01:49:36.280 --> 01:49:42.280]  info wars.com. What they did with the world council of churches, the national council of
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:47.400]  churches 100 years ago is declassified. It's public. They knew that churches had led the fight
[01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:53.720]  against King George in 1776. The black brigade, as they were known, leading them.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:57.160]  It's whether you were Catholic or Protestant, you were black,
[01:49:58.440 --> 01:50:05.000]  with a little white insignia of a priest. At that time, you spoke from the pulpit
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:10.840]  and they said, we've got to take over the seminaries. We've got to put our people in.
[01:50:10.840 --> 01:50:16.840]  And they said, we're going to use sex operations on them. We're first going to,
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:23.720]  because we can't get women into the priesthood, whether it be Protestant or Catholic, we're
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:29.160]  going to put men in. And then we're going to start having the men run sex ops and have sex with the
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:33.800]  men they can and then only recruit other men in that have had sex and then recruit young boys in
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:39.560]  that they had sex with to then take over. That's how the cult works. And they've taken over a large
[01:50:39.560 --> 01:50:44.520]  part of the civilization and they admitted it's a national security threat in the UK and pedophiles
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:47.800]  have taken the government over there. That's the London Independent, London Guardian. They've
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:53.000]  all reported it. Blackmail is how the new pope got in. Blackmail about pedophilia at the top of the
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:58.680]  papacy. But then the media here goes, oh, Trump's not rounding up pedophiles and there's no
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:03.240]  pedophiles and Jones makes it up that there's lots of pedophiles. But then I'm public enemy
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:09.800]  number one, because I understand this paradigm and the Navy SEALs and the Army folks and the FBI
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:15.160]  people and the Secret Service and the Interpol people, they're all out there. They're fully aware
[01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:19.960]  of this. And they're busy rolling up the people in their own organizations while you're seeing bust
[01:51:19.960 --> 01:51:26.120]  every day inside governor's offices, inside mayor's offices, had like what 14 Democrat
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:30.520]  mayors stepped down the last couple of years for pedophilia. I mean, it's massive. This is a
[01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:37.800]  revolution against them, more indictments at Penn State. But imagine if you saw Christians
[01:51:37.800 --> 01:51:43.880]  attacking and killing hundreds of people a day, you hear Christians attacked and Christians are
[01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:48.840]  to blame, but because it's Muslims blowing up and shooting people hundreds and hundreds today
[01:51:48.840 --> 01:51:56.360]  alone, close to 300 dead, we're saying a thousand or more injured, nothing about Muslims in Egypt
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:52:06.840]  or in Nigeria. Just truly sickening. Now that leads me to what we're talking about the takeover of
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:11.800]  the churches. They put these people in and if you look at both these women, they're both wearing a
[01:52:11.800 --> 01:52:18.120]  uniform. They both have the same haircuts. She's the woman they're interviewing. It's all part of
[01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:23.080]  the same culture, the same system. And it says Church of Sweden worships gender neutral God.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:27.720]  And it major churches in the U.S. They're pulling out George Washington and Robert E. Lee plaques,
[01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:33.400]  even though they paid to build the churches, literally. That's just history. But again,
[01:52:33.400 --> 01:52:37.800]  it's a war on reality because they don't want you know your roots because your roots would defeat
[01:52:37.800 --> 01:52:43.400]  them the minute you woke up. But so you stopped going to the church. So these folks took over.
[01:52:43.400 --> 01:52:46.440]  You stopped going to the seminary or the priesthood. So these folks took over.
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:51.000]  And now they want your kids. Now they want your pension. They're going to get it all if you don't
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:57.320]  stop them. But coming up next hour in great detail with Laura Loomer and Mike Cernovich,
[01:52:59.080 --> 01:53:07.160]  ex secret service agent. This just broke at info wars.com. This is a major, massive
[01:53:07.880 --> 01:53:13.160]  game changing event. And if this gets out, this could change the whole course of things,
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:16.840]  just like rich being murder could change the course or Hillary's emails or WikiLeaks.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:22.200]  We've already changed the course. We're already turning the tide. And as more people go public,
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.200]  not about some guy that tried to kiss him 10 years ago, and that gets equated with rape.
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:33.320]  No, no, no, there's smoke screening with normal, you know, kissing, beauty, sleeping beauty stuff.
[01:53:33.320 --> 01:53:38.280]  They're equating that with pedophilia. So it's all just a big smoke screen where sex period is evil.
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:42.840]  Or a man telling a woman she's good looking is evil. Or a gay guy telling a guy he's good looking
[01:53:42.840 --> 01:53:48.120]  is, is, is sexual assault. It's not. Most of these attacks in space, he has reportedly raped
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:51.400]  people. I think it's an horrible guy. But a lot of times he says, Hey, I want to go out with you.
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:55.320]  And they go, Oh my God, sexual harassment, you know, I'm working under you. Just whatever.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:59.720]  I'm not condoning it. The guy's out of control. It's, but when he does that, it's not the same
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:04.120]  as grabbing a man's genitals and saying, I'll have you fired. If you don't have sex with me,
[01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.160]  genitals and saying, I'll have you fired. If you don't have sex with me.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:13.160]  But the point is, is they're trying to create the smoke screen in Hollywood, the media about
[01:54:13.160 --> 01:54:19.560]  normal sexual relations being evil or being criminal because they've got Bill Clinton and the
[01:54:19.560 --> 01:54:26.040]  Lolita Express and Jerry Epstein and Clinton, more than 20 flights with little kidnap girls
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:31.000]  on board being taken to an island where they didn't just rape them folks. We know about
[01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:35.400]  the spirit cooking. We know about their operations. They're so scared of us right now. They know we're
[01:54:35.400 --> 01:54:39.480]  so close. We need more Secret Service to go public. So we have Secret Service to go public
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:48.600]  last week dealing with all the incredible corruption and dealing with the sexual assaults
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:55.560]  and dealing with the things that Bill Clinton's been up to and dealing with witnessing Joe Biden
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:55:03.080]  going after children as young as five years old groping their their buttocks. This is all coming
[01:55:03.080 --> 01:55:08.680]  out. And so go ahead and write your articles saying Trump's not going after pedophiles or that
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:12.440]  there's no pedophilia and I made it up. You go ahead historically and you put your name
[01:55:13.800 --> 01:55:19.160]  in these publications on what you stand for. So we know who you're with and what you stand for.
[01:55:19.160 --> 01:55:26.200]  Because again they're using the pedophilia as the thing to control people in the cult. X Secret
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:33.080]  Service agent threatens to drop new details about Bill Clinton and Lolita Express. infamous private
[01:55:33.080 --> 01:55:41.960]  jet was owned by sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The X Secret Service agent Dan Bongino and again
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.960]  I have really tried to get him to go public with this stuff. He said it's worse than you know Alex.
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:50.120]  It's worse than you know Bongino got into Twitter spat with former Hillary Clinton aide Nick Morell
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:56.120]  and Morell challenged Bongino and his claim that Hillary was the most manipulative political person
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:59.960]  in the world of power and he had ever met his entire life. Morell claimed Hillary Clinton as
[01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:03.480]  enormous respect with Secret Service and a great relationship with her agents in her detail. She's
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:08.200]  totally rude to him and that Bongino was never on Clinton's detail. Bongino shot back back huge
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:13.560]  Morell of being a fraud before dropping the threat to expose more. Be very careful Nick
[01:56:13.560 --> 01:56:18.680]  before known things not yet released publicly about your Messiah Hillary. Don't poke the
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:25.240]  bear loser. You may not like the results. Hashtag Epstein. Hashtag email gate tweeted Bongino.

[01:56:33.880 --> 01:56:38.680]  I never do this. I never asked Matt Rudge to put links up. I've done it like five times every time
[01:56:38.680 --> 01:56:42.120]  he's been listening. Within minutes it goes up. I don't know if he still does that. I haven't talked
[01:56:42.120 --> 01:56:48.120]  to him in a while. But even if it didn't our report on this, this is just now breaking.

[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:46.840]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the biggest piece of breaking news.
[02:00:46.920 --> 02:00:54.680]  In years we already have the pedophile networks imploding at the Vatican, at the Pentagon, at
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:01:02.440]  the major universities, at the public schools, at the Protestant churches. This is how this
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:07.640]  group of globalists using intelligence ops, this multinational corporate group that's basically
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:15.400]  like specter but in the real world gets into organizations and takes them over by compromising
[02:01:15.400 --> 02:01:24.200]  people. This is so absolutely ultra massive, ladies and gentlemen. This is so huge. Dan Bongino,
[02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:30.200]  the former head secret service agent when they did foreign details. So the head secret service
[02:01:30.200 --> 02:01:39.080]  agent for foreign operations who quit the White House of Obama because he said it's so evil on
[02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:46.280]  this show, he said it many times, it's worse than you know, Alex. It's worse than you know. He's
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:51.480]  had his house broken into, his car broken into, his family threatened. When I've had other secret
[02:01:51.480 --> 02:01:57.000]  service sources about Hillary and her collapsing because of a brain tumor, reportedly, he gets
[02:01:57.000 --> 02:02:03.240]  death threats when he wasn't my source on that. Everything Dan Bongino has ever told me has been
[02:02:03.240 --> 02:02:09.080]  here on air. Well, the Clintons had their operatives out saying he was a liar and that Hillary treated
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:13.480]  the secret service great and that Hillary was a wonderful person when I personally talked to
[02:02:13.480 --> 02:02:20.040]  Secret Service and I've talked to Blackwater people that are on record as of protecting her
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.280]  and that she treats you like an animal. That's been in books. You don't look her in the eyes.
[02:02:24.280 --> 02:02:31.080]  She hates dogs, screams and yells. They bring a search dog in. More stuff. I mean, she is a monster.
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:35.160]  She's well known. FBI agents have gone public that were in the White House. You name it.
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:43.000]  They're into desecration. People said, why does she hang crack pipes in 1995 on the Christmas tree
[02:02:43.000 --> 02:02:49.400]  and little pictures of Mao and Stalin? It was to desecrate the tree, to desecrate symbols of beauty
[02:02:49.400 --> 02:02:58.680]  and wholesomeness and goodness. Now breaking on infowars.com and newswars.com, ex-secret service
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:03:04.280]  agent threatens to drop new details about Bill Clinton and Loretta Express, the admitted pedophile
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:09.720]  playing flying children of the Caribbean island that Bill Clinton flew to, that Kevin Spacey was on,
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:15.720]  that Harvey Weinstein was on. They would go to known Islamic countries where sheiks have legal
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:21.640]  harems because Mohammed had sex with girls as young as nine. So they say it's okay. You know
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:29.160]  about women being kidnapped, taken there. This is huge. And this is who they are. And the story is there. Speaking
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.520]  back with the Clinton official that was saying he was a liar about her being rude to secret service
[02:03:32.520 --> 02:03:38.840]  agents, he called them a fraud before dropping his threat to expose more. Be careful, Nick.
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:45.880]  People know things not yet released publicly about your Messiah, Hillary. Don't poke the
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:52.680]  bear loser. You may not like the results. Hashtag Epstein. Hashtag email gate tweeted Bongino.
[02:03:52.680 --> 02:03:58.520]  Be careful, Nick. People know things not yet released publicly. He followed up asking Meryl,
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:04.760]  dear Nick, are you guys sure you know everyone on the Epstein planes? Does they mask a bunch of
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:11.880]  the names? Dear Nick, are you sure you destroyed all those blackberries? Was their government
[02:04:11.880 --> 02:04:21.880]  property in the bunch? Hashtag people know Dan Bongino at D Bongino. It's going wide open.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:28.200]  I personally talked to high level Interpol. I personally talked to people the highest levels
[02:04:28.200 --> 02:04:34.440]  of systems across the planet. They know what you do to the little kids, globalists. They know.
[02:04:35.560 --> 02:04:39.800]  And so good luck with what you're trying. And good luck with all the other stuff you pulled.
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.240]  And good luck putting out some fake stories. Hoping we report on those.
[02:04:43.240 --> 02:04:48.840]  Just credit the whole thing. Humanity is awakening to you and nothing on earth is going to protect
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:57.800]  you. So get ready to meet judgment. Get ready for judgment day, bitches. You go to infowarstore.com
[02:04:57.800 --> 02:05:03.800]  and get game changing amazing products. We've been sold out of DNA force for almost four months.
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:11.080]  These ingredients are nutraceutical grade, the highest quality, the bio-PQQ, all of it. It's 25%
[02:05:11.080 --> 02:05:16.840]  off. The truck got in this morning and it's back, but it is a limited run because of all the testing
[02:05:16.840 --> 02:05:20.680]  and all the rest of it. It's the highest quality. Read about what it'll do for you and your family.
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:25.640]  It is amazing. We've also been sold out for three months on biome defense, super high quality,
[02:05:25.640 --> 02:05:32.360]  probiotic. It's 25% off out of the gates, back in stock, but for a very limited time.
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  So you get the highest quality, the very cleanest stuff out there. We're really, really proud of it.
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:41.640]  DNA force and biome defense, probiotic. Now back in stock, infowarstore.com. And when you buy
[02:05:41.640 --> 02:05:46.520]  products from globalists, it's an act of trading with the enemy. It is an act of war. It is an
[02:05:46.520 --> 02:05:51.000]  act of standing up when you spread the links, the articles and buy products from us. And when we
[02:05:51.000 --> 02:06:04.280]  commit to rampage against the enemy totally. The globalist great error is to believe that as they
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:10.440]  collapse humanity, they end up on top. The truth is, humanity is coming down fast,
[02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:21.720]  but we're miles above them on our journey to hell. We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:06:21.720 --> 02:06:43.800]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you for joining us. Well,
[02:06:43.800 --> 02:06:48.440]  I already plan to come in here today on Black Friday and break down the fact that
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:55.960]  we've got more than 10,000 pedophiles and child porn dealers, child rapists, child traffickers
[02:06:55.960 --> 02:06:59.880]  busted. We're not just talking about somebody with child porn. A lot of them have been involved
[02:06:59.880 --> 02:07:05.880]  in that. We're talking about more than 2000 arrests of people that had children or were
[02:07:05.880 --> 02:07:09.960]  having sex with children or were trafficking children. And we're talking about children
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:16.280]  as young as six months of age. And then you see all the usual suspects, all the major liberal
[02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:24.760]  media going, Trump's not busting pedophiles. Oh, Alex Jones is making up that pedophilia exists.
[02:07:24.760 --> 02:07:29.880]  They deposed the last Pope blackmailing him over pedophilia. That was in the London Guardian.
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:35.160]  Fox News, Colorado child sex traffickers sentenced to 472 years in prison,
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:41.320]  trafficking children as young as six months of age. Boom. That just happened today.
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:46.440]  Hey, top brands pull YouTube ads over pedophilia fears. Sky News,
[02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:54.680]  Daily Mail, Google access distasteful survey, asking users to choose which child they find
[02:07:54.680 --> 02:08:02.680]  to be more attractive in a pedophilia survey. What? So that's just in the news today. And
[02:08:02.680 --> 02:08:06.360]  here's the big bombshell that ties into everything we're about to talk about.
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:11.080]  Ex-Secret Service agent threatens to drop new details about Bill Clinton and Lolita Express,
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:17.240]  arguing with former Clinton operative online, Dan Bongino, said to Nick Merrill,
[02:08:17.240 --> 02:08:20.920]  you better stop claiming that she was nice to Secret Service. You want to play games? I know
[02:08:20.920 --> 02:08:24.280]  about the blackberries. I know about Lolita Express. I know about who else was on that plane,
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:31.480]  not just Bill Clinton. And we know what you were doing. So get ready. That's up on infowars.com
[02:08:31.480 --> 02:08:39.000]  by Paul Joseph Watson. It's huge. We got Mike Cernovich hosting the fourth hour. He broke,
[02:08:39.000 --> 02:08:44.200]  of course, the John Conyers, not just hitting on women, not just harassing women, flying them in
[02:08:44.200 --> 02:08:49.080]  on government planes. But again, I think that's wrong. It's horrible. I hate John Conyers.
[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:54.280]  But hitting on women or even using government money to bring in women, that's fraud.
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:59.080]  It's not the same as pedophilia and being on airplanes with kidnapped 10-year-old girls
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:06.280]  drugged up. Imagine here, Weinstein and Kevin Spacey and all of them going to this island
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:12.520]  and with Bill Clinton and Hillary. Oh, Hillary first represented pedophiles. She loved to do it.
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:18.760]  Men, seven men raped an 11-year-old girl they kidnapped off her front porch with her bike.
[02:09:19.320 --> 02:09:21.960]  They raped her so hard she could never have children again. Do I need to get
[02:09:21.960 --> 02:09:26.360]  graphic about what happened to that little girl? They smashed her cervix all the way in
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:31.320]  until she had what they call a prolapse and her whole body came out of her. And I'm sorry
[02:09:31.320 --> 02:09:35.960]  to talk about that with people watching. Hillary Clinton made jokes about it. She thinks little
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:43.080]  girls getting raped for 24 hours with blood pouring out of them is funny. So you remember
[02:09:43.080 --> 02:09:46.520]  that when you look at that witch and you love her. And that's what Bongino said. He said,
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:56.280]  you're Messiah. What's the quote here? Be careful, Nick. People know things not just released publicly
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:01.480]  about your Messiah. Yeah, she doesn't just, she doesn't, let me just say this here. Hillary
[02:10:01.480 --> 02:10:07.720]  doesn't just, Hillary doesn't just represent pedophiles. That's why they're coming after me.
[02:10:09.160 --> 02:10:14.680]  Dear Nick, be careful, Nick. People know things not yet released publicly about your Messiah,
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:24.120]  Hillary. Don't poke the bear loser. You may not like the results. Hashtag Epstein. Hashtag
[02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:30.120]  email gate. Yeah, you know it's in the 36,000 emails. It's more spirit cooking. You got all
[02:10:30.120 --> 02:10:36.200]  those blackberries. Did you forget some? Hashtag people know. We're going to get into Laura Loomer
[02:10:36.200 --> 02:10:40.600]  with us right now. And the fact that she got the exclusive video, she did not release it.
[02:10:40.600 --> 02:10:45.400]  The media put out the lie that she released the video of Congressman Joe Burton playing with
[02:10:45.400 --> 02:10:50.360]  himself in a video to a reportedly a consenting woman. Then they lied and said, I put out the
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:55.240]  video. I did not. I didn't even blur it. I covered the computer screen with paper. It only showed
[02:10:55.240 --> 02:11:00.200]  his face because they already put up a still image to confirm that it was a real story after
[02:11:00.200 --> 02:11:04.520]  other people broke it, but to also show that he was saying it was only an image he'd sent,
[02:11:04.520 --> 02:11:09.000]  not a video. That's not true. But I said, if it was consenting, it's revenge porn against him
[02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:14.120]  and it's wrong. And I warned people about what they do on these sites. The media then spun it
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:19.240]  that I released the full edited video as revenge porn. I guess saying I had sex with Congressman
[02:11:19.240 --> 02:11:24.600]  Joe Burton, which I will assure you is not the case. He's not my type. So this is the point we've
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:31.480]  gotten to, ladies and gentlemen, where there's lies upon lies upon lies upon lies upon lies.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:35.720]  And it really, really, really makes my head spin. So we'll get into that in the next segment,
[02:11:35.720 --> 02:11:40.760]  Laura Loomer and all the rest of it. But there's clearly a civil war going on using dirt. Everybody's
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.840]  got on each other. All the data mining, all the spine, people know who the girlfriends are,
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:49.240]  who the boyfriends are, who the messresses, everybody's playing their hands now. None have
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:54.040]  been played against me because there's nothing there. And thank God, I think God, I'm not into
[02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:58.280]  the Internet. I'll tell you that right now. I've been divorced for four years. But you know,
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:03.880]  I'm a simple man. I'm not into all this stuff. I have a basic instinct not to have sex in front
[02:12:03.880 --> 02:12:07.720]  of a computer, but this is getting crazier and crazier. We'll get into Joe Burton in a moment,
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:13.480]  and I mean his misrepresentation. But what do you make of this Bongino, highly credible,
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:18.360]  top-level Secret Service agent who told me, Alex, it's worse than you know. And I go,
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:22.680]  wait a minute, worse than I'm saying? He always says that. He goes, yes, Alex, worse than you know.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:25.880]  Well, now he's letting us know he better go public or they're going to kill him.
[02:12:28.040 --> 02:12:32.920]  Well, look, Alex, that's what we've been talking about for years now, right? Bill Clinton's own
[02:12:32.920 --> 02:12:39.960]  sexual promiscuity, his sexual infidelity, and his association with sexual predators and pedophiles.
[02:12:39.960 --> 02:12:44.680]  So it really doesn't surprise me. And you know, if there's one good thing that's going to come out
[02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:51.400]  of this surge of sexual harassment allegations and sexual assault allegations, it will be the
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:13:01.800]  expose of the Clinton family and their own ties to sexual assault and sexual harassment and rape.
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:07.320]  So, you know, I'm hoping that Bill Clinton is finally exposed for the predator he really is.
[02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:11.080]  And what about all the people that have been defending him saying there's no pedophile
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:17.160]  scandals? We're making it up when it's all, it's everywhere. Yeah, well, people are starting to
[02:13:17.160 --> 02:13:21.240]  run away from the Clintons. You're already seeing people in Hollywood now are starting to back away.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:25.320]  And especially after Donna Brazil released her book about Hillary Clinton as well,
[02:13:25.320 --> 02:13:29.880]  even Democrats are starting to throw the Clintons under the bus. We see with Hollywood,
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:35.080]  Chelsea Handler sent out a tweet and replied to Juanita Broderick saying, Oh, I'm so sorry,
[02:13:35.080 --> 02:13:40.680]  I didn't see this tweet until now, but I believe you. So you have celebrities who defended and
[02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:44.760]  campaigned for the Clintons during the campaign trail saying, I believe you that Bill Clinton
[02:13:44.760 --> 02:13:51.640]  raped you. So the rats are leaving the sinking ship. We created the hashtag Hillary for president,
[02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:57.080]  lock her up. Our listeners did it. They created the whole movement that Bill Clinton's a rapist.
[02:13:57.080 --> 02:14:02.840]  And now total vindication yet again. Yeah, I mean, look, I don't know when people are going to
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:07.240]  realize Alex Jones and info wars is always right, right? They like to call you a conspiracy
[02:14:07.240 --> 02:14:11.240]  theorist and they like to call people like me and others in the alternative media like
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:16.040]  Mike Cernovich conspiracy theorists. But you know, the truth is going to come out and people are
[02:14:16.040 --> 02:14:20.440]  finally going to realize Bill Clinton is a rape, right? And Roger Stone shirts and all of the Bill
[02:14:20.440 --> 02:14:25.880]  Clinton is a rapist videos that we made, they're going to vindicate us and all of the conservatives
[02:14:25.880 --> 02:14:30.760]  who have been defending Juanita and by the way, I didn't just endorse Trump and I don't just know
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:35.160]  Roger Stone that knows Trump. I know a lot of people that know Trump way back even longer than
[02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:40.600]  Roger Stone. The truth is Trump gets obsessed with one woman showers him with gifts, treats
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:45.800]  him like a princess, just like he acts in public. Now the woman is mean to him once or twice. He
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:52.120]  leaves them. So but he's a neat freak as well. He's a one woman guy. And so I mean, I checked
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:55.480]  into all this. I mean, I know stuff the media would obviously want to know about Trump. I'm
[02:14:55.480 --> 02:15:00.120]  going to get into it on air, but I know the real Donald Trump. And so to hear that he's having
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:03.720]  women urinate on him or he has all these sexual partners, that's not Donald Trump.
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:10.120]  Well, also to I mean, you have to think to yourself a man who's in the public eye, who's a
[02:15:10.120 --> 02:15:16.360]  celebrity, who's the now president of the United States, the billionaire, people tend to have
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.360]  common sense or you would expect people in positions of power like politicians. I know
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:25.160]  we're going to talk about Congress and Martin today to have common sense, right, to not be engaging
[02:15:25.160 --> 02:15:29.720]  in these extravagant sexual affairs. I was about to say, say what you want about Martin.
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:35.240]  Okay, this voting record is not that good as a conservative. He's a neocon. What are you doing
[02:15:35.240 --> 02:15:40.120]  jerk? Excuse me. What are you doing playing with yourself in front of a live camera to webcams to
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:44.600]  a bunch of women? I mean, that that's that that's close to sticking. You know what? No, I suck it.
[02:15:44.600 --> 02:15:49.720]  I mean, that is stupid, stupid, stupid. And a lot of conservatives are mad at me for saying it's dumb.
[02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:57.480]  It is dumb. I'll throw anybody under the bus that deserves it. Heart disease is on the rise,
[02:15:57.480 --> 02:16:02.360]  clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by

[02:20:18.760 --> 02:20:24.360]  We're going to Lower Loomer here with exclusives on Congressman Dan Burton, Joe Burton, excuse me,
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:28.040]  Martin, proud of the fifth time I'm going to get it right. Teleprompter free, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:20:28.040 --> 02:20:32.040]  don't have a list in front of me, not reading off the teleprompter that somebody else filled up.
[02:20:32.040 --> 02:20:39.400]  We'll go to Lower Loomer concerning Congressman Joe Barton here in Texas, here in just a moment,
[02:20:39.400 --> 02:20:47.720]  and I'll reintroduce that. First off, we're tirelessly taking on the very power structure.
[02:20:49.240 --> 02:20:55.400]  And we've seen senior Secret Service agents go public last week saying Joe Biden groped women
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:21:03.240]  and children in front of them. That story's up on infowars.com. We now have this news story,
[02:21:03.800 --> 02:21:10.680]  ex Secret Service agent Dan Bongino threatens to drop new details about Bill Clinton and
[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:19.560]  Lolita Express. I cannot state to you how big a deal this is and how massive this piece of news
[02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:31.240]  and information is. So more of that coming up as we learn more exclusively at infowars.com right
[02:21:31.240 --> 02:21:36.040]  now. I'm going to get hold of Bongino during the break, see if he can come on. He's been on
[02:21:36.040 --> 02:21:41.640]  probably 50 times, but this is huge. The fact that he's going that public tells you they know the dam
[02:21:41.640 --> 02:21:47.160]  is breaking on the pedophile networks. Now they use that to control people. So more on that coming
[02:21:47.160 --> 02:21:55.880]  up. But right now, Congressman Joe Barton of Texas of Innis, Texas. Is he innocent? Is he a good guy?
[02:21:55.880 --> 02:22:01.080]  Is he a bad guy? Is this revenge porn against him by this woman that's going to talk to the Washington
[02:22:01.080 --> 02:22:07.000]  Post? Well, whatever it is, we're going to get Laura Loomer has been talking to these people's
[02:22:07.000 --> 02:22:13.720]  expert analysis on this. Whatever the truth is, I think it's very incompetent and very reckless
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:20.680]  to be doing something like this. I've been single before this modern age of computers and
[02:22:20.680 --> 02:22:25.720]  not even looking to date and stuff pops up that a woman's two miles away and wants to exchange
[02:22:25.720 --> 02:22:31.800]  pictures with me. What do I do? I hit the X button. I've probably done it a hundred times. So there's
[02:22:31.800 --> 02:22:36.440]  real impulse control problems here. But Laura Loomer, let's recap the case that just broke
[02:22:36.440 --> 02:22:43.000]  up yesterday or a day and a half ago and walk through what's happened and how this story's changed.
[02:22:44.680 --> 02:22:50.680]  So there were nude pictures and sex between representative Joe Barton and a woman that
[02:22:50.680 --> 02:22:56.920]  were published to Twitter from an account on the 20th. And these images circulated the web
[02:22:56.920 --> 02:23:02.120]  and they showed Joe Barton sending very graphic pictures of himself and very
[02:23:02.120 --> 02:23:08.200]  lewd text messages to a woman who he was supposedly having a relationship with.
[02:23:08.200 --> 02:23:14.600]  He admitted that the images were him and that he did send the messages and then he apologized
[02:23:14.600 --> 02:23:19.160]  and said that it was consensual and that the messages were sent while he was separated or
[02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:25.880]  divorced from his wife. And then he also said that what was seen online was what he was aware
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:30.600]  of as well. And he didn't take responsibility for a video. He said that there was just a photo,
[02:23:30.600 --> 02:23:36.600]  right? And we do know that every single aspect of his statement is now false. So it wasn't a photo,
[02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:42.360]  it was a video. The picture that circulated was a screenshot from the video. The relationship,
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:48.600]  if you look at the text messages, it took place on Tuesday, March 13th, which was in 2012. And an
[02:23:48.600 --> 02:23:54.280]  article by the Washington Post has now confirmed that these messages were sent and that this
[02:23:54.280 --> 02:24:01.000]  sexual affair took place in 2012. So Joe Barton was not separated from his wife. His wife filed
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:07.000]  for divorce in 2014 and he was officially divorced in 2015. So what Representative Joe Barton is doing
[02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:13.240]  is he's using revenge porn laws as a fake shield for his own sexual infidelity, which he lied about.
[02:24:13.240 --> 02:24:18.120]  And there's a lot more to the story that isn't really being talked about. The woman said that
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.360]  Representative Joe Barton flew her to Capitol Hill where he was working as a congressman
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:28.920]  in 2012 and gave her a tour of the Capitol and then slept with her afterwards. So I want to know,
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:35.320]  was he using his miscellaneous spending or finances as a congressman, which he's
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:41.720]  given as an allowance to fly this woman out and have sexual affairs? I mean, he,
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:45.960]  according to this woman, paid her off in cash and reimbursed her in cash for her flight
[02:24:45.960 --> 02:24:52.680]  like a prostitute. And this, the woman who spoke to the Washington Post appears to be a different
[02:24:52.680 --> 02:24:59.160]  woman from the woman who posted the messages originally online. So people are accusing you
[02:24:59.160 --> 02:25:05.800]  and I of posting revenge porn, but you know, one, I don't think this is revenge porn and two,
[02:25:06.760 --> 02:25:11.320]  I never posted any images or videos of Representative Barton. Sure, since you raised it,
[02:25:11.320 --> 02:25:16.600]  let's be clear. It was like Tuesday, you call the office, I'm not here. You've been given the raw
[02:25:16.600 --> 02:25:20.920]  footage. I wanted to show that we had the raw footage without showing us what we did. We covered
[02:25:20.920 --> 02:25:27.800]  up, you know, 90% of the screen showed the top his face and said, folks, it's not just a photo.
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:34.040]  This is a video. And I said, this was given third party to Laura Loomer. She doesn't know
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:39.160]  why it was given to her. But our whole point is if it was done to be mean, it's revenge porn.
[02:25:39.160 --> 02:25:43.960]  We dubbed that term. If it was done maliciously, didn't mean we engaged the revenge porn.
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:50.600]  I said in the video live report, that's what that's what it could be. But now the whole story
[02:25:50.600 --> 02:25:56.440]  is degenerating and officially falling apart. Something I want to bring up though is,
[02:25:56.440 --> 02:26:00.440]  is it really revenge porn? Right? I feel like Republicans are being extremely hypocritical
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:05.240]  here simply because Joe Barton is a Republican. That's right. When TMZ puts out somebody's sex
[02:26:05.240 --> 02:26:09.240]  tape that somebody put out, they don't call it that. It's called journalism. Anthony Weiner,
[02:26:09.240 --> 02:26:15.560]  right? Anthony Weiner was having a consensual sexting relationship with a woman in 2013.
[02:26:15.560 --> 02:26:20.360]  I'm not talking about the, the minor. I'm talking about, I believe it was Sydney Leathers, right?
[02:26:20.360 --> 02:26:24.760]  He believed he was having a consensual message to him was sending her sex messages and pictures
[02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:30.280]  of his penis as well. So Republicans use that to tear down Anthony Weiner. And we use that
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:35.000]  to campaign against the Clintons. And we had no problem bringing up his, his dick pics and his
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:40.600]  sexual messages and his infidelity to Huma Abedin. So what would we have done if he had said that
[02:26:40.600 --> 02:26:45.320]  was revenge porn? I really think that Republicans need to look at themselves in the mirror and
[02:26:45.320 --> 02:26:50.120]  ask themselves if they're being hypocrites. We have a right to know what our elected officials
[02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:55.240]  are doing while they're representing us on Capitol Hill. And if they're, you know, screwing around
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:27:01.160]  on the taxpayer diamond and using funds, not saying that he did, but if they are using funds to have
[02:27:01.880 --> 02:27:07.320]  Sure. Well, let's just be clear too. Weiner first got in trouble years ago for sexting adult women.
[02:27:07.320 --> 02:27:11.400]  That's separate from his conviction for the 15 year old, because the media will try to conflate
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:17.000]  that and be receptive as well. My old point, my old point in covering the fact that we have the
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:22.600]  raw video is to say it's a video, not an image. Here you can see video of his face from the same
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:29.080]  video, not showing the sexual part. It's just shocking to see mainline Republicans try to spin
[02:27:29.080 --> 02:27:35.800]  it like we're Democrats or we're bad people for covering this. They even claim we originally
[02:27:35.800 --> 02:27:40.600]  put the photos out, which isn't true. Again, it's just incredible deception.
[02:27:42.280 --> 02:27:46.680]  No, I completely agree with you. They're trying to accuse us. They're trying to make it sound like
[02:27:46.680 --> 02:27:52.840]  Representative Joe Barton sends me messages, like sexual messages directly, and that I was the one
[02:27:52.840 --> 02:27:57.640]  who released them. And that's not true. And so I have people who are messaging me like, oh, were
[02:27:57.640 --> 02:28:02.840]  you testing Representative Joe Barton? And they're acting like liberals. And that's because the media
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:08.360]  misrepresent things so badly. Right. And we have conservatives who are now falling into this liberal
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:13.320]  trap. And they're not trying to hold Representative Joe Barton. No, no, no, I agree. Let's come back
[02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:18.920]  and talk about it. But to be clear, the photos are out. It's not just a photo. It's a video.
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:24.440]  We showed we have the video without showing even his hands. We just show his face looking down
[02:28:24.440 --> 02:28:29.720]  from the same photo that was public to show we have the video. It's a video, not the other.
[02:28:29.720 --> 02:28:34.280]  And I said people are idiots if they're doing this online sex stuff. I'm not trying to go after
[02:28:34.280 --> 02:28:39.320]  Barton or anybody. I'm simply reporting that what he did though sexting is not the same as
[02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:43.800]  pedophilia. And it's not the same as all this other stuff. But if he's lying to his constituents,
[02:28:43.800 --> 02:28:47.800]  that's a whole other issue. And we've got to be fair here. We can't just go out for Democrats and
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:53.880]  leave Republicans alone. We'll be right back with Lord Limer is on the run. You're listening to the

[02:29:52.360 --> 02:30:01.880]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically,
[02:30:01.880 --> 02:30:08.440]  spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb with populations and
[02:30:08.440 --> 02:30:14.680]  globalism and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds. Things are getting crazy.
[02:30:14.680 --> 02:30:19.640]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rear guard actions to be
[02:30:19.640 --> 02:30:24.520]  prepared. The number one thing after getting right with God is to have high-quality, storeable food.
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:31.240]  Well, the entire line of my Patriot supply foods, private labeled as M4 Select, is now 50% off.
[02:30:31.240 --> 02:30:38.040]  I've only done that one time before previously. 50% off, you cannot beat that. And we're only doing
[02:30:38.040 --> 02:30:43.320]  that through Cyber Monday. So it starts today on Thanksgiving and runs through next Monday.
[02:30:43.320 --> 02:30:49.480]  M4store.com, you can go right there. It's the full spectrum of my Patriot. It's private labeled by us,
[02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:54.600]  totally fresh. Last 25 years, 50% off. 50% off. Take action today.
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:31:01.720]  America is an information-based civil war. That's why now, more than ever, we've got to hit the
[02:31:01.720 --> 02:31:06.920]  streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bullying.
[02:31:06.920 --> 02:31:12.680]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[02:31:12.680 --> 02:31:19.800]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the
[02:31:19.800 --> 02:31:26.440]  counterculture. The real punk rock is being a Patriot, who's pro-America, pro-capitalism,
[02:31:26.440 --> 02:31:32.040]  and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[02:31:32.040 --> 02:31:38.360]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberal. To defend free speech,
[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:43.800]  meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original designs
[02:31:43.800 --> 02:31:50.200]  of high-quality t-shirts for men and women, as well as more Patriot Feral at m4store.com.

[02:31:55.240 --> 02:31:58.520]  Not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[02:31:58.520 --> 02:32:03.960]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[02:32:03.960 --> 02:32:09.640]  me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[02:32:09.640 --> 02:32:16.040]  in my system. But right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[02:32:16.040 --> 02:32:21.320]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism. Right now, with all the refugees spreading
[02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:26.200]  disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:28.680]  Tell us about all the stuff I said. There's so many things that are in it.
[02:32:28.680 --> 02:32:33.160]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[02:32:33.160 --> 02:32:36.360]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:39.480]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:42.840]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, m4slife.com. And folks,
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:48.120]  you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body, period. And you support the broadcast,
[02:32:48.120 --> 02:32:52.440]  m4slife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center. Thank you so much for
[02:32:52.440 --> 02:33:03.960]  all your work, sir, on this great product. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:03.960 --> 02:33:17.480]  Another time in the age of wonder.
[02:33:17.480 --> 02:33:38.920]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:38.920 --> 02:33:52.440]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting, World Wide. It's Alex Jones.
[02:34:08.920 --> 02:34:17.720]  Why did you post the Joe Barton video and why did you pull it down? And they don't care what I say.
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:21.800]  They're going to make up what they make up. So I just say make up what you're going to make up.
[02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:28.040]  You're fake news. We're real news. I've explained the fact that if I published a book and there were
[02:34:29.080 --> 02:34:35.960]  20 chapters that I only had three chapters, it would be called excerpts. So you have a TV screen
[02:34:35.960 --> 02:34:42.040]  and you've got Congressman Joe Barton with his hand down here and I cover the whole
[02:34:42.040 --> 02:34:47.320]  middle of the screen at the top and all you can see is his eyes at the top.
[02:34:49.560 --> 02:34:57.400]  That's not publishing the video, but I understand you think somehow I can get in trouble for it or
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:01.720]  something, which of course I won't. So you want to create the illusion that we're fake news, we're
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:06.440]  illegal, we're bad, we did it. He was sending me the video. He was sending Laura Lumer the video.
[02:35:06.440 --> 02:35:10.920]  I mean, that's what you do to your victim audiences. It's why you have smaller and smaller audiences.
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:16.840]  We didn't like the fact that he was saying it was a photo, an image, when it was not an image,
[02:35:16.840 --> 02:35:23.080]  it was a video. And he was saying it was another year, 2015, when it was 2012.
[02:35:24.680 --> 02:35:27.800]  And I asked Laura Lumer, I said, what is the point of this? She goes, I don't know,
[02:35:27.800 --> 02:35:34.920]  it's for multiple parties, passed down. She didn't publish it. I showed that we had the video,
[02:35:35.720 --> 02:35:42.520]  but did not show the video. It's like saying, yeah, I was able to download a movie before it came out,
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:47.160]  which I've never done myself, but to say like, I've got Blade Runner 2 before it came out,
[02:35:47.160 --> 02:35:53.000]  go, oh, really show me, okay? Here's five seconds of it. That isn't posting Blade Runner online,
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:36:01.480]  that's showing I have Blade Runner to point out that it is a video, not a photo.
[02:36:04.120 --> 02:36:10.520]  And then I said, if this woman, it was consensual, it's revenge porn by her to go to the press.
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:17.080]  But if there's another story, maybe he's bad. It was an incredibly fair piece. And I'm not covering
[02:36:17.080 --> 02:36:24.760]  this to CYA myself. I'm covering it just like I spent an hour on that lying guy at Vox talking
[02:36:24.760 --> 02:36:33.080]  about Sean Hannity and saying Sean Hannity endorsed Roy Moore at the beginning of the campaign,
[02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:37.560]  or whether there's no Uranium One scandal, it's just showing what liars you are.
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:45.560]  That's what this is about. That's why we do this. Now, quite frankly, I had Laura Lumer already coming
[02:36:45.560 --> 02:36:49.960]  on, a great investigative journalist. She gets demonized a lot. We got Mike Cerembres that
[02:36:49.960 --> 02:36:54.200]  broke the John Conyers stuff coming up. I won't talk about what's coming next, but I got to be
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:37:03.240]  honest. Spending time on Joe Barton is really at this point secondary other than getting the record
[02:37:03.240 --> 02:37:09.080]  straight. If people ask why I took it down, because I saw the media immediately saying,
[02:37:09.080 --> 02:37:13.080]  Alex has published the full video of him doing this. I knew they were going to misrepresent it.
[02:37:13.080 --> 02:37:16.520]  And then I thought somebody else is about to put it out, because I thought it would be out by now.
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:21.320]  They're going to say that was me. So I did that. We've got the footage we put up if it covered up,
[02:37:21.320 --> 02:37:27.880]  if we need to. But the media is so deceptive now that there's a murder in Tim Buck, too. They'll
[02:37:27.880 --> 02:37:33.480]  probably say I did it. So that's my whole issue there. It was the show we had the video. The
[02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:36.600]  show he wasn't telling the truth about that. People don't understand that, that they don't have a
[02:37:36.600 --> 02:37:43.640]  brain. But the big stories on infowars.com, newswars.com by Paul Joseph Watson, Dan Bongino,
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:48.680]  senior secret service agent on foreign trips, who told me many times on air and off air,
[02:37:48.680 --> 02:37:53.080]  Alex, it's worse than you know. It's worse than you know. It's as bad as you could possibly imagine.
[02:37:53.080 --> 02:37:57.720]  Now saying, look out, Hillary Clinton was involved with Bill Clinton and Epstein on those pedophile
[02:37:57.720 --> 02:38:02.760]  flights. I want to get to this with you, Laura, in the next segment, because it's so big, and just
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:07.960]  this overall scandal and where this is going. But you get my point that a guy sending stuff to
[02:38:07.960 --> 02:38:12.280]  a woman he's reportedly dated might be creepy. If she doesn't want anymore, might be harassment,
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:17.400]  might be stalking. But on a scale of one to 10, it's like a one or a two. Lolita Express and
[02:38:17.400 --> 02:38:22.520]  kidnapped little girls, that's a 10. And so I just see the media focusing. I'm not knocking you
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:26.600]  for focusing on this or us focusing. We cover it all because we talked yesterday. We're like,
[02:38:26.600 --> 02:38:31.240]  we'll be hypocrites if we don't cover this because we're covering Democrats. So let's,
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:34.520]  let's cover the fact that we have the video. He's lying about it just being an image.
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.840]  But then the media lies about that. But at the same time, we should just set the
[02:38:38.840 --> 02:38:44.360]  registrate and move on. Yeah. And look, I don't want to continue dwelling on this. I think it
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:49.160]  was important for me to come on today and speak with you to address these, you know, wild accusations
[02:38:49.160 --> 02:38:54.040]  that we're engaging in revenge porn. Because look, there's just a lot of hypocrisy. And the problem
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:59.000]  is, is that Republicans have no issue using images against Democrats like Anthony Weiner
[02:38:59.000 --> 02:39:05.080]  to take them out of political power and to shame the Democrats. But when it comes to draining the
[02:39:05.080 --> 02:39:11.320]  swamp on the Republican side of the aisle, they just act like hypocrites. And I'm just going to
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:16.840]  quote what you said in the beginning of this segment. Judgment day is coming, bitches. So if,
[02:39:16.840 --> 02:39:21.160]  you know, if you're going to drain the swamp, you got to drain it on both sides of the aisle.
[02:39:21.160 --> 02:39:25.080]  You can't clean out your neighbor's closet if you're not going to clean out your own.
[02:39:25.080 --> 02:39:30.360]  Oh, I agree. There are swamp creatures in both parties. Oh, yeah. And, you know, if you look at
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:35.640]  all of these sexual harassment accusations and these sealed deals, and you want to talk about
[02:39:35.640 --> 02:39:40.280]  draining the swamp, forget about term limits, right? We're going to drain the swamp by sperm
[02:39:40.280 --> 02:39:44.200]  limits. That's what it's starting to look like, because it seems like a lot of men in Congress
[02:39:44.200 --> 02:39:48.040]  haven't been able to keep their, you know, their junk in their pants, and they've been
[02:39:48.920 --> 02:39:53.640]  using taxpayer funds to cover up their own sexual harassment. I don't get it. It's a power trip.
[02:39:53.640 --> 02:39:58.360]  I mean, like I'm focused on business and getting the stuff done. And it'd be one thing if a guy
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:03.320]  like had an affair once every 20 years and wasn't married or something. It's like they're all over
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:09.880]  everybody. They're like maniacs. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's very concerning. And I think that there's
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:15.480]  a lot of hypocrisy on both sides of the aisle. Democrats want to go after Republicans. Republicans
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:19.480]  want to go after Democrats. But when it comes to exposing the swamp creatures on your own side of
[02:40:19.480 --> 02:40:24.440]  the aisle, if we're going to go after one person for sexual harassment, you have to treat everybody
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:30.440]  fairly. You just can't pick and choose. Absolutely. But expanding on this, I would have thought when
[02:40:30.440 --> 02:40:34.600]  fake news blew up the Democrats' face and the media's face, they would back off. Instead,
[02:40:34.600 --> 02:40:42.040]  they've just intensified the level of fake news against yours truly, yourself, many others.
[02:40:42.040 --> 02:40:50.840]  It has reached just biblical cloud cuckoo land level. Yeah, look, it's a shame. I mean, I'm
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:55.560]  embarrassed to say that even conservatives I've respected in the past, we're engaging in this
[02:40:55.560 --> 02:41:01.880]  revenge porn narrative and trying to attack you and I on Twitter for something that, you know,
[02:41:01.880 --> 02:41:07.000]  we didn't do. They're trying to make it seem like we were very malicious. But look, I think at the
[02:41:07.000 --> 02:41:10.280]  end of the day, by the way, they never saw the footage because I took it down in 30 minutes
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:15.320]  because I saw the spin. I was like, hey, it's video, not this. Here's his face. It's video. See,
[02:41:15.320 --> 02:41:19.080]  oh, they showed it. He put the image out. I was like, whoa, I'm not going to get in. I'm not going
[02:41:19.080 --> 02:41:25.000]  to, you know, get in that briar patch. Yeah. But like I said, right? Congressman Joe Barton
[02:41:25.000 --> 02:41:29.240]  lied about when these messages were sent. He lied about being divorced from his wife.
[02:41:30.040 --> 02:41:34.840]  And he lied about his infidelity and the one he lied about it being a video. He said it was a
[02:41:34.840 --> 02:41:39.880]  photo, not a video. Yeah. And the woman told the Washington he said, this is the extent of it.
[02:41:39.880 --> 02:41:45.560]  He said this image is all there is. No, there's no video. The woman told the Washington Post that
[02:41:45.560 --> 02:41:49.480]  the Congressman Barton said, oh, should I send you a picture of myself? And she said,
[02:41:49.480 --> 02:41:54.760]  no, please do not send me a picture of yourself. So that would be sexual harassment. If she's
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:41:58.760]  telling the truth and he really did send her pictures like that and she didn't want them,
[02:41:58.760 --> 02:42:04.520]  that's harassment. If you're sending somebody unwanted pictures of yourself. All I'm saying is,
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:11.800]  Laura, is that who in their right mind, especially a public figure, jacks into the Internet and then
[02:42:11.800 --> 02:42:18.680]  masturbates in front of a webcam. I mean, that is the craziest. That is totally irresponsible.
[02:42:18.680 --> 02:42:23.480]  And I don't care who he is. Plus the guy wanted DACA. The guy wants globalism. He's a neocon.
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:28.920]  Yeah, he's he's a rhino, right? He's a never trumpet. He cheated on Americans with DACA
[02:42:28.920 --> 02:42:34.520]  and now he's been caught cheating on his wife through these sex messages and he's a responsibility and
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:39.160]  needs to resign. He needs to stop threatening this woman with a capital investigation when
[02:42:39.160 --> 02:42:45.960]  he was the one who blew her out to DC himself. And he needs to stop using his position of political
[02:42:45.960 --> 02:42:49.640]  power to try and silence women. If you're going to stand right there, we're going to come out,
[02:42:49.640 --> 02:42:57.720]  get into the big issue, the pedophilia. Support good oral health with our one of a kind,

[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:05.720]  for Thanksgiving and I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:12.520]  I appreciate you and how thankful I am. And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you
[02:44:12.520 --> 02:44:17.480]  weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have
[02:44:17.480 --> 02:44:22.520]  completely taken over not just this country but other nations. And globalism is a completely
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:29.400]  anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure
[02:44:30.760 --> 02:44:38.040]  power cult will to dominate and control society. And that we have come so far with God's help
[02:44:38.040 --> 02:44:42.680]  and have turned the tide but the enemy's tracking back so just please we should all be so thankful
[02:44:42.680 --> 02:44:48.360]  to God and thankful to each other for taking action and also girt ourselves and get ready for the
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:53.960]  next big fight ahead because history is happening. So for myself and my family, God bless you all.

[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:16.440]  There's a need for a new world order but it has different characteristics in different parts
[02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:26.840]  of the room. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:26.840 --> 02:47:30.760]  All right, Mike Cernovich is coming up with a lot of big breaking news. Laura Loomer,
[02:47:32.280 --> 02:47:36.120]  investigative journalist, Rodin Shotkin, whether she's broken so much huge news, especially on
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:42.600]  Vegas, game changing the worksheet there on so many other fronts. Got arrested during that,
[02:47:42.600 --> 02:47:46.440]  Shakespeare in the park where they were simulating killing the president, simply protesting it.
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:50.920]  That's why she gets demonized a lot by the left and right because she's taking action. She's
[02:47:50.920 --> 02:47:57.640]  getting stuff done and that's who they go after. Just briefly here, we've got Black Friday specials
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:05.720]  running. All of the specials are live right now at InfoWarsStore.com. A lot of these are going
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:09.080]  to have to end because we're very, very close to selling out of them. They've been sold out for
[02:48:09.080 --> 02:48:13.720]  weeks on Rainforest, our amazing Neutropic. It came back in last week, limited supply. That's
[02:48:13.720 --> 02:48:21.560]  still 50% off 1995. Other leading brands that have similar formulas are $60, $70. So normally at
[02:48:21.560 --> 02:48:29.240]  $29.95 or $39.95 at full price, it's a decent deal. At $19.95, it is close to being a lost leader,
[02:48:29.240 --> 02:48:35.560]  plus with the free shipping it is. We have Silver Bullet Coil, Silver 67% off, same brand,
[02:48:35.560 --> 02:48:42.200]  Jeff Bezos sells at Whole Foods for $25. We have it for $9. Super Mel Vitality, 50% off,
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:46.520]  super high. That's a great deal. InfoWars Select, emergency high quality, swarable food,
[02:48:46.520 --> 02:48:50.680]  50% off. We can hardly ever do that, but that's a free shipping on top of it. That's just insane.
[02:48:51.320 --> 02:48:56.840]  All Pro Pure items, 25% off, water filtration, knockout, amazing. Same price as a bottle of
[02:48:56.840 --> 02:49:00.520]  melatonin of the same dose, but there's eight other ingredients like L-trip, the fan,
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:04.040]  valerian root, other things that all work together for an amazing restful sleep.
[02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:07.880]  Living defense, anti-parasite cleanse, whether they need this in North Korea,
[02:49:07.880 --> 02:49:13.080]  50% off, free shipping, cross-tagar, 50% off, plus free shipping, plus many, many others.
[02:49:13.080 --> 02:49:19.400]  And these are going to have to end on Monday. On Monday, we have a couple new specials, but it
[02:49:19.400 --> 02:49:25.560]  won't be as extensive as this. I just accelerate the specials because people like them, but I
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:29.960]  got to sell a lot more products, people to fund the operation. So please commit to help us take
[02:49:29.960 --> 02:49:36.040]  on the globalist. This stuff taken on the pedophile networks and my covert funding of
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:42.520]  documentary film crews to aid law enforcement and coverage of it has got them really angry at me.
[02:49:43.080 --> 02:49:46.920]  And I'm asking for it. I'm not complaining like, oh, look at me. They're coming after me.
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:52.680]  I'm just saying you want to empower somebody that has given it all they got, not taking it lying down
[02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:58.680]  and getting results. If there was somebody else out there doing what we're doing, I'd put all my
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:04.200]  energy behind them because I'm looking for somebody doing a better job than I am. I don't think I'd
[02:50:04.200 --> 02:50:09.480]  do that good job, but I'm committed. I'm long-term. We've been proven right. But we're the best there
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:13.240]  is. And so we need your prayers, number one, spread the videos, spread the articles, get them out
[02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:15.960]  there. You've been doing that. You've been getting around the sensors. They're really upset. They're
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:22.200]  having congressional hearings on it. And commit to go to infowarstore.com today. And whether it's
[02:50:22.200 --> 02:50:27.080]  heirloom seeds for the spring that are high quality, widest selection, or water filtration,
[02:50:27.080 --> 02:50:31.720]  the very best systems, best prices, or air filtration, or Patriot apparel, or supplements,
[02:50:31.720 --> 02:50:39.240]  it's all there. Free shipping, store-wide, infowarstore.com, or AAA-253-3139. And again,
[02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:45.160]  if you'll just sign up for auto-ship, get an additional 10% off. It's free to do. The auto-ship
[02:50:45.160 --> 02:50:50.040]  saves you 10%. And you can cancel anytime you want. But if it's coffee you want once a month, or
[02:50:50.040 --> 02:50:54.440]  caveman that you want, or some of the Emirates essentials, or the new Florida Life, or the new
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:58.760]  Carnivore product, you just sign up for auto-ship on stuff that you're going to reuse, or it's
[02:50:58.760 --> 02:51:02.520]  perishable, then it comes to you each month, or every three months, or every six months.
[02:51:02.520 --> 02:51:10.120]  It goes out to, I think, six months is the edge of when you can do it. And again, 10% off additionally.
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:13.160]  So on top of that, a lot of these are lost leaders when you sign up for the auto-ship,
[02:51:13.960 --> 02:51:20.200]  and then infowarstore. Okay, so going back to Laura Loomer, who people can follow at Twitter,
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:26.920]  will give you all her contacts here in a moment. I agree. We should, it's at Laura Loomer,
[02:51:26.920 --> 02:51:32.600]  at Laura Loomer there on Twitter. I agree. We should definitely cover the Joe Barton thing,
[02:51:32.600 --> 02:51:37.880]  because it's a story of manipulation, a story of corruption, a story of just bad judgment.
[02:51:38.760 --> 02:51:43.000]  And so that's why we did it, was the show. It's not an image, and that's not the extent of it.
[02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.920]  It's a video, and there's reportedly other stuff, and other women, and I know you know some about
[02:51:46.920 --> 02:51:51.400]  that. So it's how they handle this, the arrogance of these guys, thinking, because he's at the
[02:51:51.400 --> 02:51:57.080]  Capitol and he's got power, that he could do something like this. I mean, this is just crazy.
[02:51:58.200 --> 02:52:02.200]  Much less people that put their stuff on the cloud, you know, the Hollywood stars,
[02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:07.000]  put stuff on the cloud, but then having sex with their boyfriends or girlfriends, and then wonder
[02:52:07.000 --> 02:52:14.760]  why it gets out. I mean, it's crazy. So that said, moving on past that, what do you make of the Jerry
[02:52:14.760 --> 02:52:19.240]  Epstein and the Bill Clinton and Dan Bongino, very respected secret service agent, saying,
[02:52:19.240 --> 02:52:23.960]  look, we got evidence of all of you on the plane with the kids. Look out, it's going to come out.
[02:52:23.960 --> 02:52:27.560]  That sounds to me like he's getting ready to bring it out, and he thinks in this climate,
[02:52:27.560 --> 02:52:32.040]  it's safe to bring it out. Why do you think everybody's going public from sexual harassment
[02:52:32.040 --> 02:52:36.600]  down to pedophilia right now? Why are there so many arrests? We know it's Trump, it's the courage,
[02:52:36.600 --> 02:52:40.920]  it's the turning of things, but I mean, what's happening right now, Laura, in your view?
[02:52:40.920 --> 02:52:45.800]  I think that there's a lot of things. I think that Trump being president, right? And a lot of
[02:52:45.800 --> 02:52:51.800]  people not feeling threatened by a Clinton presidency in which their lives would literally
[02:52:51.800 --> 02:52:55.720]  be threatened if Hillary Clinton was president. They wouldn't be able to come out and be public
[02:52:55.720 --> 02:53:00.280]  about all of these allegations because Hillary Clinton would most likely abuse her position
[02:53:00.280 --> 02:53:06.120]  of power to silence victims, just like she did to people like Juanita Broderick. And I think that
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:10.600]  other women are inspired. I don't believe that all of the allegations against all of these men
[02:53:10.600 --> 02:53:15.160]  are true. I think there are a lot of false allegations going around. But with regards to
[02:53:15.160 --> 02:53:21.800]  Bill Clinton, we've been hearing stories about this and we've been hearing from women for years now.
[02:53:21.800 --> 02:53:26.120]  And the mainstream media and Hillary Clinton and all of her associates have gone out of their
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:30.920]  way to silence these individuals. And some of these people have even ended up dead, right,
[02:53:30.920 --> 02:53:37.160]  with two suicide gunshots to the back of the head. So all I have to say is I really hope that
[02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:42.680]  Dan Bongino goes into some type of witness protection program or gets some bodyguards
[02:53:42.680 --> 02:53:49.080]  so that we're able to see this evidence and hear his account of events before he is found,
[02:53:49.080 --> 02:53:51.800]  like I said, with two gunshots in the back of the head.
[02:53:53.640 --> 02:53:58.200]  Well, Laura Loomer incredibly well said. I mean, that's it. And I've got to get all the video clips
[02:53:58.200 --> 02:54:02.200]  of him on this show saying, Alex, it's worse than you're saying. It's worse than you know. And I say,
[02:54:02.200 --> 02:54:06.360]  what is it? He goes, brother, I can't say, but let me just tell you, it's as evil as it gets.
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:09.640]  And then they think he told me stuff off air. So they broke in his house,
[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:13.560]  broke in his car, death-threaded him. And he would call up probably 20 times and go, listen,
[02:54:14.200 --> 02:54:17.560]  they listen to you all the time. You got to go in there and tell them I didn't tell you anything,
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:23.400]  you know, off air, because he never does. I mean, he's not a stupid guy. I'm not stupid.
[02:54:23.400 --> 02:54:27.880]  I don't want to know the stuff he knows unless it's on air. I told the DC Madam a month before
[02:54:27.880 --> 02:54:33.160]  she got hung at her mother's house. And I talked to her condo manager, whether she owned a condo,
[02:54:33.160 --> 02:54:37.320]  and I talked to her family. It wasn't her handwriting. She was murdered. She said people
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:43.640]  were after her. She was during a break. John Harmon heard it. Because he was listening in
[02:54:43.640 --> 02:54:47.160]  while she was on the phone. She's like, oh, I got them all. I don't want to hear any names.
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:50.520]  She didn't say any names. I said, lady, I said, lady, say it all on air right now,
[02:54:50.520 --> 02:54:56.120]  or don't tell me a word. I said, they're going to kill you. And she said, oh, no, I've got people
[02:54:56.120 --> 02:54:58.920]  that have got the records that, you know, they thought their mom, that's why they went to her
[02:54:58.920 --> 02:55:03.800]  house. And I didn't want to know. You either get it all out like Jim Garrison said in the JFK
[02:55:03.800 --> 02:55:09.320]  assassination. You stay in the sunshine. I don't know any secrets that I basically haven't said
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.560]  on air that are life-threatening. Because if somebody starts trying to tell me some big secret
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:20.440]  I know I'll get you killed, I go, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, partner, tech, stop right there.
[02:55:20.440 --> 02:55:26.520]  I do not want to know this unless you're ready to go public right now. These people just don't
[02:55:26.520 --> 02:55:31.320]  get how dang it. But I mean, Bon Genos was a decorated New York cop, very good secret service
[02:55:31.320 --> 02:55:35.960]  agent. He's not stupid. So, I mean, I think he's getting ready to go public. What do you think?
[02:55:35.960 --> 02:55:38.920]  I've been calling him the last two hours, five times. He had an answer.
[02:55:38.920 --> 02:55:43.320]  I hope he goes public. And look, you know, you're not the only one who's been speaking
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:48.280]  with sources like this tied to the Clintons, people that have information on his abuse of power
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:53.720]  when it comes to, you know, sex with others. I know somebody who told me that they were in
[02:55:53.720 --> 02:55:59.400]  one of the presidential motorcades at President Bill Clinton allowed Kevin Spacey to use where
[02:55:59.400 --> 02:56:04.360]  Kevin Spacey would literally be having gay sex in the back of President Clinton's motorcade
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:09.720]  while President Bill Clinton was in town because they were buddies. There's a lot of these security
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:16.840]  guards and personnel and secret service agents who are very aware of, you know, the promiscuity
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:23.160]  and just this very disgusting perverse nature of Bill Clinton. The lawlessness, the lawlessness.
[02:56:24.040 --> 02:56:30.760]  I mean, using taxpayer dollars in a security motorcade to engage in acts of gay sex. It's just,
[02:56:31.800 --> 02:56:37.400]  You're saying you've got federal sources that were there while, I mean, that told you that Spacey
[02:56:37.400 --> 02:56:42.360]  was having basically sex parties in the backs of limos in the motorcade.
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:47.880]  Yeah, I'm not going to confirm whether or not they still are still active, you know,
[02:56:49.320 --> 02:56:55.560]  federal security officers. But yes, I do have sources who have told me that they witnessed
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:57:01.960]  Kevin Spacey having gay sex with men in the back of President Bill Clinton's motorcade.
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:06.120]  And again, the media calls us fake news. How much, how many stories have we put out,
[02:57:06.120 --> 02:57:10.360]  have you put out that have turned out to be dead on? I mean, it's just, it's a daily basis.
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:15.320]  Everything we've talked about because we have real sources. All of the information I put out
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:19.480]  regarding Vegas was true, but I was called the conspiracy theorist. I was called crazy.
[02:57:19.480 --> 02:57:22.840]  People on the right demonize me. Well, that's because most of the right,
[02:57:22.840 --> 02:57:28.280]  I saw the articles that attack you and I yesterday. It's Soros talking points. Every one of them was,
[02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:33.800]  you know, all these lies. He lost his kid, you know, this lawsuit. He's a loser. He's a liar. He
[02:57:33.800 --> 02:57:39.080]  says he's fake. It's just, it's a formula. These people are literally getting $20,000 a year from
[02:57:39.080 --> 02:57:43.640]  Soros and they're just losers. We'll be back. Stay there, Laura Loomer and Mike Cernovich straight
[02:57:43.640 --> 02:57:50.920]  ahead. I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically,
[02:57:50.920 --> 02:57:58.280]  spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time with populations and globalism
[02:57:58.840 --> 02:58:03.720]  and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds. Things are getting crazy.
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:08.680]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rear guard actions to be
[02:58:08.680 --> 02:58:13.560]  prepared. The number one thing after getting right with God is to have high-quality, storeable food.

[03:00:03.720 --> 03:00:17.320]  Waging war on corruption is Alex Jones. Coming up in the next segment, Mike Cernovich always
[03:00:17.320 --> 03:00:22.360]  got big breaking news because he gets on the phone, he talks to sources, he talks to reporters.
[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:26.920]  Once you start breaking big stories, other sources come. You vet the source, you break the story.
[03:00:26.920 --> 03:00:32.440]  Mainstream media could run circles around info, or around Mike Cernovich, or around Laura Loomer.
[03:00:32.440 --> 03:00:39.320]  But they don't do the old fashioned stuff we do. And the more I don't burn sources,
[03:00:39.320 --> 03:00:42.520]  the more I tell the truth, the more we build our credibility over the years.
[03:00:43.640 --> 03:00:47.000]  I have so many sources and so much breaking stuff, I can't even keep track of it.
[03:00:47.640 --> 03:00:54.440]  I mean, most people would get a Joe Barton video and not know what to do with it for three days.
[03:00:56.840 --> 03:01:00.200]  Because it just takes so much analysis to even know what to do with all this.
[03:01:00.200 --> 03:01:06.120]  How to do the right thing. And then the media will come back with a spin, so deceptive,
[03:01:06.920 --> 03:01:13.160]  you don't even know how to respond. It's like, what? You do a video saying, if this woman released
[03:01:13.160 --> 03:01:17.640]  this as a revenge porn, she should be arrested. But if he's lying about it, he should get in trouble.
[03:01:18.840 --> 03:01:23.000]  Here's just his face, so you know we really have the video and it's not just a photo.
[03:01:23.000 --> 03:01:29.080]  Then the media, Jones released the full unblurred video. And you're like, here's the video,
[03:01:29.080 --> 03:01:33.640]  we didn't do that. Shut up. You're going to jail. You're like, well, we didn't release the video.
[03:01:33.640 --> 03:01:37.320]  And they just don't care. It's not like you're even worried about getting in trouble if you're
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:44.280]  doing anything wrong. It's like the neocons want to arrest you. And so do the Democrats. And it's
[03:01:44.280 --> 03:01:48.920]  like, all you want to have a prosperous country and tell the truth. And like, dude, I don't care
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:53.240]  what you're doing. You can't be a congressman while you're at the Capitol in your office,
[03:01:53.240 --> 03:01:58.280]  masturbating into a camera. It's crazy. I don't want my kids thinking that's normal.
[03:01:58.280 --> 03:02:05.720]  And I'm not some goody two shoes guy. I've got common sense. What in the world are you doing?
[03:02:05.720 --> 03:02:11.320]  All this free love stuff. You're going to have sex with somebody you don't even trust or know.
[03:02:13.160 --> 03:02:18.520]  That's what sex is all about is about trust. It's not like some goody two shoes conservative thing
[03:02:18.520 --> 03:02:22.360]  that I say that just so I can act cool and everything. I wouldn't want to have sex with
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:27.080]  somebody that looked like a supermodel. If they were some empty soul, that sounds horrible.
[03:02:27.080 --> 03:02:32.360]  But the soulless people, they love it. It's why there's a big market now in robot sex toys. What
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:39.720]  a joke. Or, or, or, you know, the fleshlight and all this crap. It's all emptiness. Go have sex
[03:02:39.720 --> 03:02:46.280]  with a mannequin. It's just crazy. Laura Loomer, great job breaking all this and letting me make
[03:02:46.280 --> 03:02:49.720]  the decision what to do with the video. I think we did the right thing, you know, covering it all
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:53.240]  up except his face. So the folks knew he was lying about it being an image. I'm not against.
[03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:57.480]  I wanted to make you aware really quick. If you have a few moments of another
[03:02:57.480 --> 03:03:01.560]  breaking news update regarding another sex scandal that's about to be released within
[03:03:01.560 --> 03:03:06.200]  the next few days, it was supposed to come out today, but it looks as if the accuser is now
[03:03:06.200 --> 03:03:12.600]  being threatened or intimidated by the congressman who she is accusing of having an extramarital
[03:03:12.600 --> 03:03:19.560]  affair with. So apparently there's a 19 year old GOP staffer who had an affair with a married
[03:03:19.560 --> 03:03:25.480]  lead, uh, never Trump or Republican congressman. And the, uh, a major newspaper was going to
[03:03:25.480 --> 03:03:29.720]  break the story this morning. And then the woman is claiming that around 4 30 in the morning,
[03:03:29.720 --> 03:03:35.400]  she got a call from a blocked number that reminded her that she signed an NDA so that if
[03:03:35.400 --> 03:03:40.600]  she were to go public with things, she would be sued. So here we go. NDAs don't cover,
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:46.520]  don't cover sex. They don't cover stuff that's illegal. Not that sex is illegal. It doesn't
[03:03:46.520 --> 03:03:51.240]  cover private stuff like that. I mean, you could argue they did, but it's just not true.
[03:03:51.960 --> 03:03:56.280]  I just want you to know, I mean, just how disgusting is that that this, this woman who may
[03:03:56.280 --> 03:04:01.640]  have been 18 or younger, we know that she's 19. We're not being told when the extramarital affair
[03:04:01.640 --> 03:04:06.840]  happened. But now this woman who wants to come forward and she may be a victim of harassment
[03:04:06.840 --> 03:04:11.720]  is now trying to, is starting to be threatened, uh, with, with NDA. She signed to work for
[03:04:11.720 --> 03:04:15.960]  congressman. I mean, look, it happens on the right and it happens on the left. I'm going to
[03:04:15.960 --> 03:04:21.000]  say it one more time. If you want to drain the swamp, you have to be fair and drain the entire
[03:04:21.000 --> 03:04:26.440]  swamp. You can't just make Democrats look bad. So Republicans, please stop being hypocrites.
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:30.920]  Uh, if you're going to expose perverts like Weiner, you should also expose other perverts
[03:04:30.920 --> 03:04:35.960]  on the right. Uh, that's sure. Absolutely. Absolutely. Well, and again, I'm not pooping
[03:04:35.960 --> 03:04:40.600]  any of this is very important. They're using the whole women's sex scandal, women cheating on
[03:04:40.600 --> 03:04:44.760]  their husbands, men cheating. You know, that's being made synonymous with pedophilia. That's,
[03:04:44.760 --> 03:04:48.600]  that's a totally different thing. I'm just being immoral compared to absolute criminal
[03:04:48.600 --> 03:04:51.320]  activity. Thank you, Laura Loomer. We'll be right back with Mike Cernovich.
[03:04:53.880 --> 03:04:59.560]  So Laura, thank you. I point out a lot to our listeners and viewers that without you funding
[03:04:59.560 --> 03:05:05.720]  our operation by purchasing products and in full or store.com, we would not be here. We don't have
[03:05:05.720 --> 03:05:10.280]  corporate sponsors. We don't have globalist funding. We're funded by patriots like you.
[03:05:10.280 --> 03:05:14.920]  And we also, of course, provide high quality products to make it easy to support yourself
[03:05:14.920 --> 03:05:20.200]  and to support us symbiotically as we try to retake this country and the planet
[03:05:20.200 --> 03:05:26.200]  and heal the population that's been under globalist engineering. That said, we're running
[03:05:26.200 --> 03:05:31.720]  biggest specials ever every single year during Black Friday. And this year is even better than
[03:05:31.720 --> 03:05:37.400]  last year. We've got free shipping store-wide on everything. We've got huge sales like
[03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:46.440]  brain force 50% off, pro-pure, water filters 25% off. We've got 50% off on select high quality
[03:05:46.440 --> 03:05:52.200]  extortable foods. That's unprecedented. We've got super male vitality 50% off and so much more.
[03:05:52.200 --> 03:06:08.120]  So check it out today.
[03:06:13.240 --> 03:06:17.240]  That's right. Mike Cernovich and I co-hosting much of this show about the turn of the baton
[03:06:17.240 --> 03:06:24.440]  over to him, but he broke the big John Conyers story last week. And they go, oh, fake news king,
[03:06:24.440 --> 03:06:28.520]  Mike Cernovich breaks another story. Then you go through every one of his stories, none of them are
[03:06:28.520 --> 03:06:33.720]  fake. And then I can't even keep track of all the stories that we break that turn out to be
[03:06:33.720 --> 03:06:38.120]  totally accurate because we get them directly from the president or we get it from sources.
[03:06:38.120 --> 03:06:42.280]  We're getting people that were at the dinner with McMaster when he was saying the president was an
[03:06:42.280 --> 03:06:48.520]  idiot and a moron and couldn't believe he had the new codes and all the rest of it. And then word
[03:06:48.520 --> 03:06:56.600]  for word, it breaks two months later and they don't even give us credit. I know he gave his story to
[03:06:58.360 --> 03:07:04.120]  Buzzfeed was a daily beast. It's all the same thing. But one of those, I forget which one it was this
[03:07:04.120 --> 03:07:10.840]  week. I tweeted about it. They literally took our entire McMaster story, even took paragraphs that
[03:07:10.840 --> 03:07:16.520]  were quotes and didn't even give us credit. Then when I linked to Russian news, they say I'm a
[03:07:16.520 --> 03:07:22.360]  Russian agent and I'm plagiarizing, even though it says RT on it. So what I'm saying is the media
[03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:30.040]  didn't learn by lying and losing the election to stop. They think they didn't do enough, but it's
[03:07:30.040 --> 03:07:39.480]  not working. But I happen to know for a fact that they've had all these major so-called news
[03:07:39.480 --> 03:07:44.680]  organizations contacting people I went to high school with. So I've gotten the calls and contacting
[03:07:44.680 --> 03:07:50.280]  old girlfriends and other people and then talking to literal schizophrenics online and crazy people.
[03:07:50.280 --> 03:07:53.000]  There's like four or five women that say I was married to and I've never even met them.
[03:07:54.520 --> 03:07:59.640]  These women, some of them say I'm a reptile from another planet and the media still talks to them.
[03:08:00.200 --> 03:08:04.040]  So I'm just waiting for the new entertainment. By the way, there'll be no apologies here whenever
[03:08:04.040 --> 03:08:11.000]  this BS comes out because it's not there. Somebody says they've got me playing on myself into a webcam,
[03:08:11.000 --> 03:08:17.080]  no they don't because that's never done that. Joe Barton, Texas, if it was consensual,
[03:08:20.040 --> 03:08:27.160]  then it's a whole other story, but is it revenge porn? I don't know. But why would you be doing
[03:08:27.160 --> 03:08:32.760]  that into a webcam? I mean, why do you think you can trust these people you don't know and you're
[03:08:32.760 --> 03:08:38.120]  dealing? That's what marriage is about, is a woman you love and you care about and that you trust
[03:08:39.160 --> 03:08:42.840]  to the keys of the house, the bank account, the whole nine yards. Take care of your ass
[03:08:42.840 --> 03:08:46.840]  when you have a heart attack or a car wreck, man. I mean, I really, one thing about my kids is I'm
[03:08:46.840 --> 03:08:51.480]  wondering which one of these kids is the best? It's going to take care of me. You know, is my
[03:08:51.480 --> 03:08:57.880]  wife going to really take care of me when I get old? That's what this is all about. I mean, I wouldn't,
[03:08:57.880 --> 03:09:01.560]  and it's not that I wasn't a party animal when I was younger,
[03:09:03.880 --> 03:09:07.800]  but I just couldn't randomly have sex with some person I barely knew. Plus I'm married,
[03:09:07.800 --> 03:09:12.520]  but if I wasn't, just because it's all about who the person is and what they stand for and
[03:09:12.520 --> 03:09:17.480]  the fact that you know them. It's not just like jumping bet with somebody. I just, it's just
[03:09:17.480 --> 03:09:22.760]  crazy. And again, doesn't come from some moralistic stand. It comes from an experience of life.
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:26.280]  Separately, I got to ask Mike Cernovich before he breaks all this other big news.
[03:09:26.280 --> 03:09:30.920]  He's a hard-working reporter. Mainstream media could run circles around us if they were allowed
[03:09:30.920 --> 03:09:34.120]  to because he's just one guy. I'm a small organization. They've got all this money,
[03:09:34.120 --> 03:09:37.880]  but they've got to go through the chain of command to see what's allowable because they're not their
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:43.640]  own people. We are. It means we have the triumphs together. We fail. You know, it's win, lose,
[03:09:43.640 --> 03:09:50.200]  or draw. We're real. But what does Mike Cernovich make of Dan Bongino, the former top secret service
[03:09:50.200 --> 03:09:55.800]  agent on foreign operations, very highly respected, former New York City cop, always telling me on
[03:09:55.800 --> 03:09:59.880]  air, Alex, it's worse than you know. And now he comes out and tells the Clinton operative,
[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:04.680]  stop saying you were nice to Secret Service. Stop saying she wasn't a pig because she's well
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:07.960]  known for that. I've talked to people in Blackwater Secret Service. You know how rude she was.
[03:10:07.960 --> 03:10:12.520]  Bongino would never give secrets. He said, Alex, it's worse than you're saying. I'd say, Dan,
[03:10:12.520 --> 03:10:18.680]  how's it worse? He said, Alex, it's worse. And now he's saying basically hashtag Epstein,
[03:10:18.680 --> 03:10:23.480]  hashtag email gate, hashtag people know. He says, we've got blackberries. We know who was on the
[03:10:23.480 --> 03:10:29.080]  airplane. We know who had their identity covered up. We know who went to the island. The whole
[03:10:29.080 --> 03:10:33.480]  house of cards that appears is starting to come down. I don't think Dan Bongino, a guy that holds
[03:10:33.480 --> 03:10:38.920]  it close to his breast, would be saying this if he didn't know it was all about the hammer. I mean,
[03:10:38.920 --> 03:10:46.680]  are we about to see hammer fall? Well, I mean, here's something that I don't know if you and I
[03:10:46.680 --> 03:10:53.400]  ever talked about or made public. But the reason I knew about Hillary's health is that the secret
[03:10:53.400 --> 03:11:01.160]  service had been, which they never do. If you want to talk about people who never leak, the secret
[03:11:01.160 --> 03:11:06.040]  service, they pride themselves. They don't leak. People who say, oh, I mean, they leaked to us for
[03:11:06.040 --> 03:11:11.000]  the first time ever. People didn't even believe it. Yeah, because they don't leak and they haven't
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:16.360]  leaked since I know people all over Secret Service. They're not going to tell you anything. But Hillary
[03:11:16.360 --> 03:11:21.320]  Clinton, they called it hazard pay. And the joke was, you know, how if you're deployed to Iraq,
[03:11:21.320 --> 03:11:27.000]  or Afghanistan, and you're doing a hard mission, you get hazard pay, they called working for Hillary
[03:11:27.000 --> 03:11:32.600]  Clinton a hardship duty and hazard duty. And here's something that hasn't been reported.
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:38.040]  Remember when Hillary Clinton had her incident on 9-11? And then she disappeared.
[03:11:39.560 --> 03:11:44.440]  She had to be cleaned up because I don't want to go into detail, but she had an accident.
[03:11:44.440 --> 03:11:50.120]  She defecated on herself. Yeah, she had an accident. And because a lot of people don't know that when
[03:11:50.120 --> 03:11:54.680]  you have Parkinson's and other neurological conditions, you're capable of losing control.
[03:11:54.680 --> 03:11:57.320]  A lot of times we have an epileptic seizure. You have a major bowel movement.
[03:11:58.040 --> 03:12:04.120]  Yeah. So that's why they rushed her over to Chelsea's. And they had to clean her up and
[03:12:04.120 --> 03:12:08.440]  everything like that. And that, of course, comes from Secret Service. And I haven't gotten anything
[03:12:08.440 --> 03:12:10.840]  from them before that or since. And I don't think I'll ever get an answer.
[03:12:10.840 --> 03:12:15.000]  I was about to say, we only got intel from the Secret Service on her falling down. They said
[03:12:15.000 --> 03:12:18.360]  follow her. And it was only that one time people couldn't believe it. And then when it happened,
[03:12:18.360 --> 03:12:26.600]  they got really blown away. Yeah, exactly. So that's how much she abuses the people.
[03:12:26.600 --> 03:12:30.360]  She abuses. And what do you make? What do you make now of them coming out about Biden molesting
[03:12:30.360 --> 03:12:34.280]  little girls and now Bongino coming out? I mean, this shows, I guess they're getting
[03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:38.920]  the green light from Trump or what's going on? Well, I don't know that we want to say
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:43.000]  Biden has been molesting anybody. I think we just want to say he's a little creepy.
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:46.440]  And that's the kind of thing that we should be asking. But the Secret Service agent said
[03:12:46.440 --> 03:12:50.600]  that it was like wine scene level a little kids. Yeah, you know, we want to be careful,
[03:12:50.600 --> 03:12:54.840]  though, because the media is looking to frame us for so many things. I just think that,
[03:12:54.840 --> 03:12:58.840]  you know, right now you're like the New York Yankees. I'm like the Boston Red Sox.
[03:12:58.840 --> 03:13:02.440]  And, you know, we want to be careful in our wording in our language because
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:06.120]  they're waiting for us because we're now in the major leagues, right? We're at the highest level
[03:13:06.120 --> 03:13:10.680]  of the game. So we, you know, there, there are definitely a lot of things about Biden we want
[03:13:10.680 --> 03:13:15.560]  to look at. And those pictures are weird. And if that were any Republican, the media, it would
[03:13:15.560 --> 03:13:20.040]  be all hands on deck. If that was Roy Moore, they'd be convulsing. Yeah, that would be like the
[03:13:20.040 --> 03:13:23.320]  biggest story. I want to be clear. He's not molesting the girls in the videos. The Secret
[03:13:23.320 --> 03:13:29.880]  Service agent says it was wine scene level groping of women and girls. Well, you can just watch the
[03:13:29.880 --> 03:13:35.000]  videos and the New York Times even tried to get the guy banned. The guy who broke the story or
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  not necessarily broke it, but compiled it all. Sure. The guy that had viral videos with millions of
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:44.920]  views. Yeah, yeah, exactly. And the New York Times reporter has said, oh, no, oh, no, this is more
[03:13:44.920 --> 03:13:49.400]  fake news. And they called it an alt-right attack. But it's actually the guy who broke it is half
[03:13:49.400 --> 03:13:54.840]  African American. And he's very just a traditional kind of family values conservative. And the New
[03:13:54.840 --> 03:14:00.040]  York Times is literally on Twitter saying, ban this person, even though all you have to do is look
[03:14:00.040 --> 03:14:04.520]  at the videos. The videos are creepy. There's that video of Jeff Sessions smashing him away.
[03:14:04.520 --> 03:14:10.040]  And he's rubbing her hair. I mean, I have daughter, you have daughters. That isn't normal to rub,
[03:14:10.040 --> 03:14:15.640]  to rub a girl's hair. And they need to ask him about it. So like, like I said, I don't know what
[03:14:15.640 --> 03:14:21.480]  exactly is going on there. But I don't think most, I had parents. I've had, I've not had a single
[03:14:21.480 --> 03:14:25.640]  parent say, oh yeah, that's like totally okay. That's the number one way you come on to a woman
[03:14:25.640 --> 03:14:29.960]  is to rub their hair and rub it on their ear. It's the first thing you do. I mean, it's just like,
[03:14:29.960 --> 03:14:36.600]  it's a boom. It's a come on. Yeah, I haven't had a single parent. I show that those videos to parents,
[03:14:36.600 --> 03:14:40.280]  even liberals and they're like, dude, if some old man was rubbing my daughter's hair and rubbing on
[03:14:40.280 --> 03:14:45.240]  her ear, I'd say, dude, keep your claws yourself. Yeah, you would have something to say about it.
[03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:50.840]  You might not say he's a pedo. Maybe he's just weird or awkward, doesn't have boundaries. And then
[03:14:50.840 --> 03:14:55.240]  of course there's that video of the, or the picture of the, she's a full grown woman, thankfully,
[03:14:55.240 --> 03:14:59.720]  but she's sitting on Joe Biden's lap, like a biker chick and he's caressing her and stuff.
[03:15:00.680 --> 03:15:05.000]  I mean, let's be real, dude. If this were, if this were you or me and there are all these pictures of
[03:15:05.000 --> 03:15:10.760]  us, we would be wall-to-wall coverage. People would be staked out at our house asking questions.
[03:15:10.760 --> 03:15:15.320]  But then when all you do is show the pictures of Biden and don't even editorialize them,
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:20.200]  you just show the pictures. The New York Times goes, oh no, we got to ban this guy from Twitter.
[03:15:20.200 --> 03:15:24.520]  How dare we have an African American on Twitter talking bad things about the Democrats.
[03:15:24.520 --> 03:15:29.160]  And notice that's the new thing on Vox and on the Daily Show and on all the
[03:15:29.160 --> 03:15:34.600]  shows, ban, ban, ban. They have tattle shows. They go, look at this guy, ban that guy, look at this guy,
[03:15:34.600 --> 03:15:39.800]  ban that guy. I want to come back and ask you, why is this all happening now? That's the big question.
[03:15:39.800 --> 03:15:44.760]  Where is it going next? And where is Trump doing a great job? But where is he going sideways?

[03:17:59.160 --> 03:18:04.840]  Thanksgiving. And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I
[03:18:04.840 --> 03:18:11.560]  appreciate you and how thankful I am. And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you
[03:18:11.560 --> 03:18:16.520]  weren't there taking action and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have
[03:18:16.520 --> 03:18:21.560]  completely taken over not just this country but other nations. And globalism is a completely
[03:18:21.560 --> 03:18:28.360]  anti-individual, anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure
[03:18:28.360 --> 03:18:36.040]  power, cult, will to dominate and control society. And that we have come so far with
[03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:41.000]  God's help and have turned the tide but the enemy is tracking back. So just please, we should all
[03:18:41.000 --> 03:18:46.760]  be so thankful to God and thankful to each other for taking action but also girt ourselves and
[03:18:46.760 --> 03:18:52.200]  get ready for the next big fight ahead because history is happening. So for myself and my family,
[03:18:52.200 --> 03:18:53.880]  God bless you all. Have a great Thanksgiving.

[03:19:56.120 --> 03:19:58.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:19:58.840 --> 03:20:21.560]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind. And now your host, Mike Cernovich.
[03:20:21.560 --> 03:20:29.480]  Right, Mike Cernovich cohost with me this hour. I'm going to get out of here at this segment, let him take over, even though he's always inviting me on.
[03:20:31.240 --> 03:20:36.920]  We got the war room coming up at three o'clock. Lil' Troyer.
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:43.960]  Everywhere you see the pedophilia breaking in Europe and the Catholic Church and universities in Australia
[03:20:44.520 --> 03:20:50.680]  and sex range, it's how they compromise people. Again, that's how they get control of organizations.
[03:20:50.680 --> 03:20:55.960]  This is enough to have somebody knock over liquor stores. They want the types that will hurt kids.
[03:20:55.960 --> 03:21:00.520]  And look at this. Top brands pull YouTube ads over pedophilia fears. Sky News.
[03:21:01.560 --> 03:21:05.480]  Elsegate, the disturbing YouTube trend that might be terrifying your children,
[03:21:06.280 --> 03:21:13.160]  where they put sick stuff into regular videos that they're labeled family friendly. So your
[03:21:13.160 --> 03:21:17.960]  child sees something sexual or a child being murdered, kids being run over by trains, their
[03:21:17.960 --> 03:21:23.080]  eyeballs being ripped out, happy bunny rabbits and stuff, and the demon kills them. It's the
[03:21:23.080 --> 03:21:30.280]  spiritual religion of lesser magic psychologically hurting. Google acts as a distasteful survey that
[03:21:30.280 --> 03:21:38.360]  asks users to choose an image of a child they like best for pedophilia. Meanwhile, the Colorado
[03:21:38.360 --> 03:21:44.360]  sex trafficking hundreds of children is six months old. He got 472 years. That's Fox News.
[03:21:44.360 --> 03:21:50.360]  But I see articles everywhere saying none of this exists. None of this happens.
[03:21:51.400 --> 03:21:58.040]  None of this is going on. These are really creepy sick people that want innocence. They're demons
[03:21:58.040 --> 03:22:02.280]  that eat innocence. Whether you believe in God or not, this is the manifestation of what it is.
[03:22:03.240 --> 03:22:07.720]  And I want to ask Mike Cernovich in closing before he takes over what the next big shooting
[03:22:07.720 --> 03:22:12.760]  drop is and why this is happening. But first, this is Black Friday and we're running the biggest
[03:22:12.760 --> 03:22:18.360]  specials undoubtedly of the year. And I've got a special running on our best-selling Nutrubbit

[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:30.360]  Silver Bullet, Coil Silver. I use it topically on my gums or on cuts or any other sore throat I use
[03:22:30.360 --> 03:22:33.880]  it. Sometimes when antibiotics aren't working, that's what I use. And thank God for me personally,
[03:22:33.880 --> 03:22:38.520]  it's been just a dream. Super male vitality. But consult your physician and see if you want to
[03:22:38.520 --> 03:22:42.520]  use antibiotics first. I'm just saying it's been known to be something that's in that same spectrum.

[03:23:01.640 --> 03:23:08.280]  at infowarstore.com. And this is a financial war. They're trying to stop us all. They've demonetized
[03:23:08.280 --> 03:23:12.120]  us on YouTube. They've got, you know, their lawsuits and all the rest of stuff. I'm not
[03:23:12.120 --> 03:23:16.120]  liberty to get into it this time. I'm going to be able to get into it very, very soon to get the
[03:23:16.120 --> 03:23:20.440]  war drums going and go on the offensive of what we're going to do. Actually, I see this as an
[03:23:20.440 --> 03:23:26.200]  opportunity to take these people on. But let's just say this, the very Jerry Epstein crowd is,
[03:23:26.200 --> 03:23:30.280]  they're on the war footing because we got them cornered. Just like the NFL that got political,
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:35.240]  we're going to ring the alarm bell and we're going to have major, major victory on every front.
[03:23:35.240 --> 03:23:40.600]  Just please, why battle the Christmas crowds? Why battle the Black Friday crowds for crap you
[03:23:40.600 --> 03:23:45.560]  don't need when we've got high quality products you do need that support the info war and a 360
[03:23:45.560 --> 03:23:51.160]  win and infowarstore.com. Okay, Mike, thanks for coming on with us and co-hosting today.
[03:23:52.600 --> 03:23:58.600]  Get into what moment in history are we, what is this paradigm I see of, you know,
[03:23:58.600 --> 03:24:03.800]  Prince Charming kissing, sleeping beauty is now rape. That's got to be banned in the UK.
[03:24:03.800 --> 03:24:09.720]  They're equating a man kissing a woman with a six month old being raped to death by a man in a demon
[03:24:09.720 --> 03:24:14.760]  mask. So they've clearly got something going here. I don't think it's working. There's a revolution
[03:24:14.760 --> 03:24:18.520]  going against the pedophile networks. We know they're using for control. That's been in major
[03:24:18.520 --> 03:24:23.720]  British news, European news. We know about it here now. They've been identified. They've got systems
[03:24:23.720 --> 03:24:27.720]  they use to mitigate it, but I don't see it working for them. What period are we in in history
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:32.840]  and how are the pedophile armies going to strike back? Yeah, it's interesting now that all the
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:39.240]  YouTube stuff is getting attention. YouTube has been dropped by major advertisers now.
[03:24:39.240 --> 03:24:45.080]  And I think it's interesting that I've had a documentary of mine censored on YouTube.
[03:24:45.080 --> 03:24:49.720]  Paul Joseph Watson has been censored. Even liberals like H3, H3,
[03:24:51.320 --> 03:24:56.040]  liberals, nobody's safe if you're talking about politics. But if you're a pedophile or you're
[03:24:56.040 --> 03:25:01.720]  doing videos on YouTube where you mock, execute children, you tie them up. I sent some images
[03:25:01.720 --> 03:25:07.560]  actually to your staff earlier of a tweet where it shows children tied up, chained. There's an
[03:25:07.560 --> 03:25:14.040]  evil clown with a chainsaw. YouTube will let you monetize those videos and they profit from all of
[03:25:14.040 --> 03:25:19.080]  those videos. And let's be clear. I'm afraid to show it because they'll ban us for showing it,
[03:25:19.080 --> 03:25:24.280]  but they'll let some other group do it. But we should just show your discretion is advised.
[03:25:24.280 --> 03:25:27.160]  So they don't tell you that. They sneak in and there's a happy bunny and then a demon
[03:25:27.160 --> 03:25:31.720]  rips its guts out. They're really scarce kids. I ran into this like a year ago without even knowing
[03:25:31.720 --> 03:25:37.160]  when it was. I was like, what the hell is that? But yeah, that's the hashtag. Let's show some
[03:25:37.160 --> 03:25:44.040]  of the images. Go ahead and show those. Go ahead. Go ahead, Joe. I mean, Joe Rogan's clips there.
[03:25:46.440 --> 03:25:52.920]  It'll show children drinking alcohol. You can see children being intoxicated, drunk.
[03:25:52.920 --> 03:25:57.080]  They have little star emojis on their head. They're falling down, bleeding,
[03:25:57.080 --> 03:26:01.400]  bleeding out of their skull. What it is is porn for losers that want to teach children heart.
[03:26:01.400 --> 03:26:04.840]  This is the pedophile spirit. I can't get enough of them. So this is what this is about.
[03:26:05.720 --> 03:26:10.360]  Yeah. They use cartoon characters and that because what they do is, you know, you, you,
[03:26:10.360 --> 03:26:13.160]  you, you have your children and they're watching very family friendly videos.
[03:26:13.800 --> 03:26:18.520]  They sneak this in and they go, Oh, Mickey Mouse, right? So your child is watching Mickey Mouse and
[03:26:18.520 --> 03:26:23.560]  then they're being drunk and intoxicated, being cut off. There's actually even more
[03:26:24.360 --> 03:26:29.400]  disgusting stuff. Your great friend, Charlie Roselle of Buzzfeed, as you know, you and Charlie
[03:26:29.400 --> 03:26:35.960]  are very, very good friends. And he did a big story on Buzzfeed about these Ukrainian
[03:26:37.640 --> 03:26:43.640]  video videos that were even worse than this kind of stuff. And we've been talking about this for
[03:26:43.640 --> 03:26:47.080]  a long time. Why do the left criticize that? That's what they love. I mean, I mean, we had
[03:26:47.080 --> 03:26:53.160]  Salon saying how great pedophilia was. Well, Buzzfeed is trying to become a little bit more
[03:26:53.960 --> 03:26:59.160]  of a legit media enterprise because they're realizing that Bison's lawn and the pedophile
[03:26:59.160 --> 03:27:05.640]  media networks, people don't want pedophile content. That is a fringe, marginal group of just
[03:27:05.640 --> 03:27:08.360]  deal. And this whole coming out of the pedophiles is backfired on them.
[03:27:09.560 --> 03:27:13.000]  I mean, so, so are they going to back away from Piscay? That's admittedly a false.
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:17.640]  Well, there, there, I don't know. I don't know, but I'm just glad to see progress,
[03:27:17.640 --> 03:27:22.520]  Alex. I'm an optimist in that. Well, that's my next question. Why did you give your big
[03:27:23.240 --> 03:27:30.680]  story about John Conyers to Pissfeed? So, because I knew that if I broke it or we broke it,
[03:27:30.680 --> 03:27:35.160]  it would be discredited and no social change would have happened. Sure. I give it the best
[03:27:35.160 --> 03:27:38.680]  way to go after Conyers is in a liberal publication, because then it would devastate.
[03:27:38.680 --> 03:27:43.400]  Exactly. So I had, so why did they still run it though, even though it was hurting their Lord
[03:27:43.400 --> 03:27:48.200]  and Savior? Well, it was too big of a story and they knew that I would have run it anyway.
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:27:53.560]  Right. That's the whole point is I have it and you can say, well, Cernovich is going to run it
[03:27:53.560 --> 03:27:58.760]  or they can develop it and they worked very hard on it independently developed it. So I'll tell
[03:27:58.760 --> 03:28:03.400]  you, Alex, she's honestly, this is one of the most Christian things I've ever done because I was
[03:28:03.400 --> 03:28:07.800]  sick to my stomach because exactly you gave it to them because they could develop it,
[03:28:07.800 --> 03:28:11.560]  prove it up in themselves. But maybe you gave them the big story that you could have had credit
[03:28:11.560 --> 03:28:16.440]  for because it was for the better. Yeah. The glory, you know, it's like they say all glory to God.
[03:28:16.440 --> 03:28:22.360]  Like I was about to throw up because I'm thinking, oh my God, I will be the biggest story for the week.
[03:28:22.360 --> 03:28:26.840]  At least I'll be attacked by the machine and I wanted to embrace it all. But then I realized,
[03:28:26.840 --> 03:28:33.320]  no, we have to protect people from these debits in Congress. We have to just put aside our egos
[03:28:33.320 --> 03:28:38.520]  for the greater good this one time because that's what it's going to take. And as you know,
[03:28:38.520 --> 03:28:44.920]  multiple people in Congress are now saying that they want to unseal all 264 records that all the
[03:28:44.920 --> 03:28:50.680]  coverups have. Let's talk about that because boy, are they scared of that. Our tax money to settle
[03:28:50.680 --> 03:28:59.160]  all their whack-a-mole stuff. Hello, Mr. Anderson. The NSA has noticed how much time you spend on

[03:29:59.640 --> 03:30:04.760]  got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from
[03:30:04.760 --> 03:30:11.240]  their bullying. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:30:11.880 --> 03:30:18.280]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the
[03:30:18.280 --> 03:30:24.920]  counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism,
[03:30:24.920 --> 03:30:30.520]  and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[03:30:30.520 --> 03:30:36.840]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberal. To defend free speech,
[03:30:36.840 --> 03:30:42.360]  meet like-minded friends, and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original designs

[03:30:53.720 --> 03:30:59.480]  I know I don't have to remind most of you of the fact that culturally, societally, economically,
[03:30:59.480 --> 03:31:06.040]  spiritually, militarily, the planet's sitting on top of giant time bomb with populations and
[03:31:06.040 --> 03:31:12.280]  globalism, and the new world order's manipulation of people's minds. Things are getting crazy.
[03:31:12.280 --> 03:31:16.520]  We're trying to fix the country and fix the planet. We've also got to have rear-guard
[03:31:16.520 --> 03:31:21.240]  actions to be prepared. The number one thing I forget to write with God is to have high-quality

[03:33:17.240 --> 03:33:26.840]  The Alex Jones Show. Because there is a war on for your mind.
[03:33:47.960 --> 03:33:53.800]  Seeing mainstream media shown to be liars. The fact that Trump was elected really let
[03:33:53.800 --> 03:33:59.560]  everybody know who'd been intimidated. Now is the season to stand up and now it's cascading.
[03:33:59.560 --> 03:34:03.560]  You're gonna have some fake people that jump on the bandwagon and you're gonna have this info
[03:34:03.560 --> 03:34:08.600]  that's mixed in there. But overall this collapse, this tsunami, this mountain slide,
[03:34:10.200 --> 03:34:16.520]  this rock slide of truth is real and it signifies the beginning of a massive turning
[03:34:16.520 --> 03:34:21.880]  that scientists and historians say we're part of historically. Now's the time. History rhymes,
[03:34:21.880 --> 03:34:29.240]  it repeats as well. And so you see the NFL and Hollywood and MTV and Nickelodeon,
[03:34:29.240 --> 03:34:35.400]  they can't help but commit suicide politically. They can't help but do things that are unpopular.
[03:34:35.400 --> 03:34:39.720]  They can't help but destroy themselves because that's their nature. They're part of the old system
[03:34:39.720 --> 03:34:45.800]  that's going out where a bunch of arrogant people got controlled and their kids got controlled and
[03:34:45.800 --> 03:34:51.480]  their kids got control. And it was all about being sellouts. That's what got you ahead. But now
[03:34:51.480 --> 03:34:57.560]  that's coming to an end. It's all about being honorable. Speak to why it's happening now and
[03:34:57.560 --> 03:35:02.680]  who the enemy are. I want your take on that and what you think the next shooting drop is because
[03:35:02.680 --> 03:35:10.600]  they're not giving up. Well it started to break last year which is why you and I were framed and
[03:35:10.600 --> 03:35:16.120]  why a lot of disinfo was spread about a lot of the pedophile stuff and that's why we have to be
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:23.880]  very careful now. The next shooting drop I think is going to be false flags sent to us to frame us
[03:35:23.880 --> 03:35:30.440]  to distract from the bigger story because we had always said, we had always said, you and I and
[03:35:30.440 --> 03:35:36.920]  others, there's massive sex abuse going on in Washington is being covered up and then they
[03:35:36.920 --> 03:35:43.240]  go, oh, Alex and Cervish claims that there's an underground dungeon and a parlor like no, we never
[03:35:43.240 --> 03:35:48.120]  talked about that. And the media makes that the big issue. They focus on that. We say, yeah, we
[03:35:48.120 --> 03:35:53.960]  covered people's reports. That isn't real. We'll say we correct. I corrected. But you do them a
[03:35:53.960 --> 03:36:01.080]  favor. Then they act like you're the creator of it. So they distracted from that. But now with the
[03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:05.880]  John Conyers thing, we now have proof that there are secret settlements of abuse. There could be
[03:36:05.880 --> 03:36:11.800]  pedophile stuff in those secret files. That's the whole point. We now have proof with the Conyers story.
[03:36:11.800 --> 03:36:16.680]  And again, that is why I went to an outlet that has been very critical of you and very critical of
[03:36:16.680 --> 03:36:23.160]  me because it's just like what we tell people every day. It isn't about us. It's about America.
[03:36:23.160 --> 03:36:28.680]  It's about the message. It's about putting goodness into the world. And sometimes you work with people
[03:36:28.680 --> 03:36:35.960]  who are maybe being a little hard on you for the greater good of humanity. So now the dam is breaking
[03:36:35.960 --> 03:36:40.680]  in Washington, D.C. and they're off. I agree. The dam is breaking. So far, we've just seen the
[03:36:40.680 --> 03:36:44.920]  beginning of the water. The big day lose is coming. How big is it? What do you expect?
[03:36:46.360 --> 03:36:52.040]  Well, we already know that there are 264 sealed settlements that are official.
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:56.200]  And you know, I bet 50 of those are underage pages.
[03:36:56.200 --> 03:37:02.120]  That's my guess because they go back. They go back when the congressional
[03:37:02.120 --> 03:37:07.480]  page program was still around. And I bet you we're going to find all kind of underage stuff
[03:37:07.480 --> 03:37:12.120]  going on in their taxpayer money. One year there was a $4 million with the settlement.
[03:37:12.120 --> 03:37:17.640]  Who really knows what's in there? And that's the whole point is we just wanted to get the truth out
[03:37:17.640 --> 03:37:23.720]  there. And the Conyers settlement wasn't even one of the 264. By the way, I have that chart.
[03:37:23.720 --> 03:37:30.600]  There you go. We have the chart here. And the settlements date back to 1997. The Conyers one
[03:37:30.600 --> 03:37:40.120]  was an off the books one in 2007, $4 million in 2002, $3.9 million. So we're just round up for
[03:37:40.120 --> 03:37:45.640]  2002, $4 million. And again, most of it's off record. This is just a drop in the bucket. Any
[03:37:45.640 --> 03:37:51.720]  idea how big the real settlements are? Exactly. There's no way to tell, but that is why we had
[03:37:51.720 --> 03:37:56.760]  to break the dam with Conyers and now multiple congressmen and women, including Tulsi Gabbard,
[03:37:56.760 --> 03:38:00.760]  Dana Roebacher, Representative DeSantis, they are now saying unseal the deals.
[03:38:01.480 --> 03:38:06.520]  We're going to make it all public. Unseal these records. Even Roebacher, awesome. I'm glad he
[03:38:06.520 --> 03:38:13.800]  got back in Congress. Yeah, Dana Roebacher is amazing. And Tulsi Gabbard is also a real freedom
[03:38:13.800 --> 03:38:19.000]  fighter, even though she's maybe a bit more liberal leftist center. But even DeSantis said,
[03:38:19.000 --> 03:38:24.520]  hey, we have to unseal these records. So there are 264 confidential settlements totaling over
[03:38:24.520 --> 03:38:31.000]  $17 million. That's just based on the books. I think this could be a scandal like the congressional
[03:38:31.000 --> 03:38:36.520]  bank scandal where Congress could look completely different in 2018 because there are hundreds
[03:38:36.520 --> 03:38:40.920]  of congressmen and congressmen. Any word on how if it leans Democrat or Republican, we know both
[03:38:40.920 --> 03:38:47.400]  parties are full of pervs. I mean, well, there's a reason the media didn't chase us down. There's
[03:38:47.400 --> 03:38:54.840]  a reason the media attacked me for the Kanye story, rather than say, oh, wow, there's all
[03:38:54.840 --> 03:38:59.160]  these settlements. Cernovich got one. If he can get one, I feel inspired. I'm going to go try
[03:38:59.160 --> 03:39:04.360]  to get one too, right? Notice they don't do that. That tells you it's probably mostly Democrats,
[03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:08.120]  because otherwise the media would have already got this story and chased down.
[03:39:08.120 --> 03:39:11.960]  Oh, they would have gone completely crazy. If they thought it was 60% Republicans,
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:17.800]  they would have gone into connection fets. Exactly. And that's why they attacked me,
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:22.440]  because I go to these journalists who are attacking me. I go, why don't you go do some
[03:39:22.440 --> 03:39:26.760]  real journalism? Why don't you try to find out who these other other settlements are involving,
[03:39:26.760 --> 03:39:30.680]  rather than, oh, Mike Cernovich is a mean guy. Did you hear what he tweeted one time? And
[03:39:30.680 --> 03:39:34.600]  let's take them on the context and show unedited videos and blah, blah, blah.
[03:39:34.600 --> 03:39:39.240]  I go, you're a bunch of losers. Okay. Why don't you go out and beat me at my own game,
[03:39:39.240 --> 03:39:43.880]  do some journalism? Well, they don't want to, because they know most of these settlements
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:48.040]  are going to involve Democrats and they want to protect the Democrats. That's exactly what's
[03:39:48.040 --> 03:39:53.160]  happening. Mike Cernovich, Et Cernovich, and of course you've got your books and all the rest
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:57.160]  of it. I'm going to get out of here and let you take over. He always invites me on a co-host
[03:39:57.160 --> 03:40:01.960]  with him, listeners that I'm trying to hog in on what you're doing. It's just incredible to see
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:06.120]  this season of awakening taking place. It's certainly an amazing time to be alive. And I'm
[03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:10.440]  very thankful for the audience and the crew and everybody else for the position we're in.
[03:40:11.800 --> 03:40:17.000]  It really is incredible. Go ahead, Mike.
[03:40:17.000 --> 03:40:21.480]  Yeah, it's big for everybody. Alex, you and I had actually talked about this.
[03:40:22.360 --> 03:40:27.400]  We had mentioned, so we kind of called it before it happened. Remember when the hurricanes
[03:40:27.400 --> 03:40:32.760]  happened, we did a segment where we talked about how this was going to be actually a moment of
[03:40:32.760 --> 03:40:37.480]  human consciousness where we're collectively going to level up? We talked about that.
[03:40:37.480 --> 03:40:43.000]  No, I agree. How do we continue to call stuff? A lot of times without even sources, it's like,
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:47.400]  I'm not just saying this, we're dialed into the oracle or something. It really is weird
[03:40:47.400 --> 03:40:52.440]  because I'll just say stuff that comes out of my gut too. And you too, it just keeps coming true.
[03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:58.280]  Exactly, because you could feel the mood of the nation had lifted
[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:04.920]  where everybody was coming together and then the goodness and the virtue call it spiritual,
[03:41:04.920 --> 03:41:08.920]  people call whatever they want to do. I don't care what a person's religion is or if they're not.
[03:41:08.920 --> 03:41:13.880]  People are sick of the hate. You could just sense it. Yeah, you could just sense that everybody was
[03:41:13.880 --> 03:41:18.840]  like, I'm tired of Trump is evil. Alex Jones is evil. Senator Mitch is evil. People go, no, look,
[03:41:18.840 --> 03:41:24.840]  Hurricane Harvey, people came together, all races, all religions and united. And that was a unique
[03:41:24.840 --> 03:41:31.240]  one. We said this, we can find a clip. We said this is a once in a generation opportunity
[03:41:31.800 --> 03:41:36.680]  for our collective consciousness to level up. And then all of a sudden now you have,
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:41.640]  because when you live in a better environment, you become more courageous and you want to fight
[03:41:41.640 --> 03:41:45.640]  for what's good and not for what's bad. So then Ronan Farrow, who's a very liberal guy,
[03:41:45.640 --> 03:41:49.880]  finally said, you know what? I'm going to take on Hollywood. I'm going to take on the establishment,
[03:41:49.880 --> 03:41:54.520]  the damn breaks. And now you have people like me saying, look, we're going to take on Congress.
[03:41:54.520 --> 03:41:59.160]  We're now the dam is broken in Congress. And next thing you know, YouTube is saying, oh,
[03:41:59.960 --> 03:42:04.280]  yeah, you're right. We've had pedophile stuff on our websites for years and never did anything about
[03:42:04.280 --> 03:42:10.280]  it. But you just said it. We have to get ready to win big. But then once we win, we've got to be
[03:42:10.280 --> 03:42:15.240]  ready to deliver and be moral, replacing the people that we just took out. Because evil is
[03:42:15.240 --> 03:42:20.040]  not invincible. It always acts like it is until it falls. Are we actually beginning to see the
[03:42:20.040 --> 03:42:27.160]  fall of evil to a great extent? We're seeing a change in season of definitely where it is going
[03:42:27.160 --> 03:42:33.000]  to become cool to be a moral person. It's going to become cool to be opposed to the pedophiles,
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:38.920]  to the deviants, to the degenerates. That's what is happening culturally. And evil never goes
[03:42:38.920 --> 03:42:43.720]  away just as goodness never goes away. They're always in opposition. And right now it's up to
[03:42:43.720 --> 03:42:48.520]  all of us and everybody listening to try to spread spread goodness. But good is getting the upper
[03:42:48.520 --> 03:42:52.440]  hand. The good is getting the upper hand and they're panicking. Mike's turning a bit straight ahead.
[03:42:54.440 --> 03:42:58.840]  I'm driving home here about to take off a few days for Thanksgiving.
[03:43:00.360 --> 03:43:04.360]  And I just want to impart my message to the listeners and viewers of how much I appreciate
[03:43:04.360 --> 03:43:10.840]  you and how thankful I am. And I also just want to re-emphasize the point that if you weren't
[03:43:10.840 --> 03:43:15.960]  there taking action, and if you weren't there spreading the word, globalism would have completely
[03:43:15.960 --> 03:43:21.640]  taken over not just this country but other nations. And globalism is a completely anti-individual,
[03:43:21.640 --> 03:43:31.320]  anti-God, anti-family, anti-Christian cancer that is just pure power cult will to dominate
[03:43:31.320 --> 03:43:37.160]  and control society. And that we have come so far with God's help and have turned the tide,
[03:43:37.160 --> 03:43:42.360]  but the enemy's tracking back. So just please, we should all be so thankful to God and thankful to
[03:43:42.360 --> 03:43:47.320]  each other for taking action. And also, girt ourselves and get ready for the next big fight
[03:43:47.320 --> 03:43:52.440]  ahead because history is happening. So for myself and my family, God bless you all. Have a great
[03:43:52.440 --> 03:43:58.520]  Thanksgiving. America is an information-based civil war. That's why now more than ever we've
[03:43:58.520 --> 03:44:03.640]  got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from
[03:44:03.640 --> 03:44:10.120]  their bullies. We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[03:44:10.120 --> 03:44:16.040]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate
[03:44:16.040 --> 03:44:22.600]  is truly the counterculture. The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America,
[03:44:22.600 --> 03:44:29.400]  pro-capitalism and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant. Modern liberalism is a counterfeit
[03:44:29.400 --> 03:44:35.720]  of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism. They are the anti-liberal. To defend free speech,
[03:44:35.720 --> 03:44:41.240]  meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide. We've got more than 60 original designs

[03:47:03.160 --> 03:47:25.960]  And now your host Mike Cernovich.
[03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:35.720]  And we're back, Mike Cernovich, facebook.com forward slash Mike Cernovich, viral videos,
[03:47:35.720 --> 03:47:42.920]  breaking news, nonstop 24 seven. Right now we had a story come in that is consistent with what a lot
[03:47:42.920 --> 03:47:51.960]  of you know, namely an SJW, a feral leftist has learned that what you can get away with on a college
[03:47:51.960 --> 03:48:00.600]  campus, well, it's a little bit different than real life. And moreover, a lot of people are doing what
[03:48:00.600 --> 03:48:07.240]  I've told them to do. I've had multiple people arrested actually for assault, which no conservative
[03:48:07.240 --> 03:48:10.920]  would ever do because they're like, well, you know, just take it, take the abuse. And I go, no,
[03:48:10.920 --> 03:48:17.720]  you don't just take the abuse, call the police. So there's now breaking news. A student is accused
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:23.480]  of snatching a make America grading and hat from a Trump supporter may face a year in jail.
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:28.120]  So here's what happened. There's a video of that that went viral a little while ago.
[03:48:28.840 --> 03:48:33.000]  A college student was on campus, a college Republican and a student came in and yanked
[03:48:33.000 --> 03:48:40.440]  the hat off the person's head. Wouldn't give it back. Police were involved. This student is now
[03:48:40.440 --> 03:48:49.880]  facing a year in jail. And this is, this is what keeping it real goes wrong. They go, man,
[03:48:49.880 --> 03:48:55.720]  F your laws. So the person who stole the hat, he's, you know, she, I think it was a woman. I'm
[03:48:55.720 --> 03:49:00.920]  not even sure anymore. I don't want to miss Jen or anybody, you know, Edith Macias. I don't want
[03:49:00.920 --> 03:49:05.240]  to say if that's a woman or a man, you know, because I don't want to get banned from the
[03:49:05.240 --> 03:49:11.160]  internet because as we know, as YouTube has shown, if you misgender somebody, then you can get banned
[03:49:11.160 --> 03:49:17.160]  from the internet. But if you do pedophile videos, then YouTube will sell advertising based on that
[03:49:17.160 --> 03:49:23.160]  and profit from it. So Edith Macias took a hat and the person who was a crime victim said, you
[03:49:23.160 --> 03:49:31.160]  know, give me my hat back. And Macias replied, man, F your laws. You're effing freedom of speeches,
[03:49:31.160 --> 03:49:37.800]  genocide, homeboy. Is that what you're trying to represent? Please have to come in and take action.
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:43.000]  So this is the lawlessness now that you've had. You've had coming from the left.
[03:49:44.680 --> 03:49:49.400]  And people have accepted it. They think that they can come in and just commit any crime that
[03:49:49.400 --> 03:49:54.520]  they want to commit. But if you actually do commit crime, and in this case is an escalated
[03:49:54.520 --> 03:50:01.560]  elevated misdemeanor, because physical force was used to steal that. So generally grand theft is
[03:50:02.840 --> 03:50:09.160]  property theft over 400. Well, this is violence was used to take this hat. Now a lot of people go,
[03:50:09.160 --> 03:50:13.800]  oh, Cernovich, you're being too sensitive. They're just kind of snatching your hat and just look,
[03:50:15.160 --> 03:50:21.160]  these people are criminals. They are running wild. They are committing violent acts everywhere you
[03:50:21.160 --> 03:50:27.240]  go. They sucker punch people. They're macing people. If we find them on a technical legal
[03:50:27.240 --> 03:50:32.440]  violate, I call the police on them. Again, I got five people arrested last year. And I'm actually
[03:50:32.440 --> 03:50:37.960]  quite proud of myself for doing that. Three women assaulted somebody and we call the police on them
[03:50:37.960 --> 03:50:43.080]  and the police goes, well, they threw guacamole at a bunch of us. Actually, I don't know if I
[03:50:43.080 --> 03:50:48.760]  ever told the story. But I was covering a pro Trump rally. This was during the campaign towards
[03:50:48.760 --> 03:50:55.320]  the end of the election. And there was a popup rally in West Hollywood. The bar owner said, hey,
[03:50:55.320 --> 03:50:59.800]  you know, we want to show you that even if you don't agree, you can be fine. So a bunch of people
[03:50:59.800 --> 03:51:07.000]  went to this restaurant with pro Trump regalia on Trump hats. The food was literally thrown.
[03:51:07.000 --> 03:51:11.720]  There was a riot inside the restaurant. And the Trump supporters, the owner said, look,
[03:51:11.720 --> 03:51:16.760]  I'm really sorry, but this is violent. You know, would you guys just please leave and Trump supporters
[03:51:16.760 --> 03:51:21.640]  always being classy? He said, okay, they'll leave. They were throwing food, guacamole,
[03:51:21.640 --> 03:51:26.440]  you know, the things were thrown. And I actually, an African American gentleman who was there said,
[03:51:26.440 --> 03:51:31.720]  you know, I'm actually a liberal and I don't like Trump, but I'm embarrassed by what I just saw.
[03:51:32.520 --> 03:51:37.080]  But they're out of control. So then what happened is one of the women or two of the
[03:51:37.080 --> 03:51:41.720]  women came in and they grabbed this guy's hair and then one of them took his phone and threw it
[03:51:41.720 --> 03:51:49.240]  down. We had it on video. We call the police. The police came and they were mad because they were
[03:51:49.240 --> 03:51:53.320]  obviously Hillary people. They were mad that we call the police and they go, we're not going to
[03:51:53.320 --> 03:51:58.120]  arrest her. This is nothing. Just get over it. And I said, look, I'm a lawyer. What you're doing
[03:51:58.120 --> 03:52:04.120]  right now is a civil rights violation. You're engaging in discrimination based on a political
[03:52:04.120 --> 03:52:08.120]  viewpoint. And that's a violation of the Equal Protection Clause, Equal Protection Clause,
[03:52:08.120 --> 03:52:14.440]  the Constitution. And they glared at me. They go, get over there. Get over there. And I go,
[03:52:14.440 --> 03:52:19.160]  look, I can stand here and watch. I go, I just do want to let you know, here's my bar card.
[03:52:19.160 --> 03:52:22.600]  You know, I have a California, I am a licensed attorney in California. I said, here's my bar
[03:52:22.600 --> 03:52:27.480]  card. I just do want to let you know that I am an attorney and that if action isn't taken, I will
[03:52:27.480 --> 03:52:33.240]  be suing you for civil rights violations because this is unconstitutional. And then they realized,
[03:52:33.240 --> 03:52:38.680]  okay, they have to enforce all equally. They knew because I would have sued them for sure in a
[03:52:38.680 --> 03:52:43.560]  second because if they don't want to enforce the Constitution, they have an obligation to.
[03:52:43.560 --> 03:52:47.560]  Doesn't matter who you vote for, if you're a police officer, you have to treat everybody equally.
[03:52:47.560 --> 03:52:53.560]  And the next thing you know, these women were put in the backseat of a police car charged with
[03:52:53.560 --> 03:52:59.080]  assault, criminal assault. You can find the docket. I even posted all the information,
[03:52:59.080 --> 03:53:04.280]  the docket sheet and everything. And I've had other people arrested too. So if you're a Trump
[03:53:04.280 --> 03:53:08.680]  supporter and somebody steals your hat, if they throw something at, that's assault. If they spit
[03:53:08.680 --> 03:53:14.440]  at you, that's assault. Get it on camera, call the police. A friend of mine, R.C. Maxwell,
[03:53:14.440 --> 03:53:19.640]  was sucker punched at a pro-Trump rally. He's an African-American Trump supporter.
[03:53:19.640 --> 03:53:24.600]  He was sucker punched at a pro-Trump rally, a video of that surfaced. So you know what I did?
[03:53:24.600 --> 03:53:30.040]  I offered a $1,000 reward. See, the media never tells about this. And then they go,
[03:53:30.040 --> 03:53:34.280]  oh, Cernovich is always promoting himself and talking about himself. The media never talks
[03:53:34.280 --> 03:53:39.560]  about the good that I do in the world. So I saw that an African-American Trump supporter had been
[03:53:39.560 --> 03:53:46.120]  sucker punched and I put it on Twitter. I would give a $1,000 reward to the first person who
[03:53:46.120 --> 03:53:51.000]  identifies the assailant. Exactly. A Trump supporter. So Washington Post for their credit
[03:53:51.000 --> 03:53:56.040]  did cover this in August. A Trump supporter was sucker punched by a counter-protester.
[03:53:56.040 --> 03:54:02.840]  Why isn't it a hate crime? So when I saw this man who I've met, he's a friend of mine. I don't know,
[03:54:02.840 --> 03:54:09.560]  friend, I like him. He likes me kind of thing. And I said, this is wrong that he was sucker punched.
[03:54:09.560 --> 03:54:17.720]  I offered a $1,000 reward to the person who found it. Sure enough, we identified, not we, but a
[03:54:17.720 --> 03:54:22.920]  friend of his or somebody identified the assailant. The assailant pled guilty to criminal assault.
[03:54:22.920 --> 03:54:28.200]  He was actually arrested. The man who was sucker punched and a hate crime, this African-American
[03:54:28.200 --> 03:54:33.880]  American Trump supporter, he was actually trying to flee. He was trying. There you can see it.
[03:54:33.880 --> 03:54:38.680]  We're watching right now in video and in the highlighted image. You can see a white person come,
[03:54:39.400 --> 03:54:43.880]  sucker punch a black Trump supporter. Well, isn't that interesting? You know, let's zoom in on it.
[03:54:43.880 --> 03:54:48.040]  So we have an African-American Trump because, but Trump supporters were racist. You know,
[03:54:48.040 --> 03:54:54.200]  we hate black people. We hate everybody, you know, but this white man, this white guy comes in,
[03:54:54.200 --> 03:54:59.400]  sucker punch is a Trump supporter. When I saw that, I said, I will not, I will not stand for
[03:54:59.400 --> 03:55:03.960]  this. I will not allow this hate crime to happen, this hate crime to go and check. So I did. Yeah,
[03:55:03.960 --> 03:55:08.520]  I offered $1,000 for the identification of the thug who punched the black Trump supporter.
[03:55:08.520 --> 03:55:15.800]  And we were able to identify him and I did pay out that reward. I don't know if I wrote a story
[03:55:15.800 --> 03:55:21.560]  about it, but I am tweeted out a link to it, to Brown Hannity, I believe who it was. So
[03:55:21.560 --> 03:55:25.720]  R.C. Maxwell calls himself Black Hannity and this other guy calls, he's Hispanic calls himself
[03:55:25.720 --> 03:55:32.920]  Brown Hannity. So I did tweet out public recognition and gratitude for him. And this guy,
[03:55:32.920 --> 03:55:38.680]  you know, he was identified and he was trying to flee the state and he was charged with assault.
[03:55:38.680 --> 03:55:46.360]  He now has a criminal record. He is now a criminal. So those of you who try to understand how we're
[03:55:46.360 --> 03:55:51.480]  a little bit different here, how we're a little different. Well, the national review and all
[03:55:51.480 --> 03:55:56.680]  these kind of old school William F. Buckley conservatives would say, oh, take the high road.
[03:55:56.680 --> 03:56:01.080]  There is no high road when you're a crime victim. I don't go around punching people.
[03:56:01.080 --> 03:56:05.960]  I don't go around putting my hands on people. I don't go around sucker punching African-American
[03:56:05.960 --> 03:56:11.480]  Hillary supporters, right? So when they commit a crime, if they steal your hat,
[03:56:11.480 --> 03:56:16.600]  they assault you, they vandalize your car, if they're committing crimes against you,
[03:56:17.480 --> 03:56:22.760]  involve the police immediately and get them arrested, lock them up. They are criminals.
[03:56:22.760 --> 03:56:27.560]  They are thugs. And the media, if you're listening in here in the mainstream media,
[03:56:27.560 --> 03:56:33.960]  quit enabling this kind of behavior. Start actually covering the violence against Trump supporters
[03:56:33.960 --> 03:56:37.400]  because, you know, I'm a Trump supporter. If I sneeze on somebody, they'll go, oh, Sernovich,
[03:56:37.960 --> 03:56:44.040]  put poison gas on people. I can't believe it. Terrorism. You charge them under the Patriot Act.
[03:56:44.040 --> 03:56:47.400]  You put them away. I can't believe it. He sneezed on somebody. Chemical warfare.
[03:56:48.280 --> 03:56:54.280]  But then when you have a white Hillary person, sucker punch, an African-American Trump supporter,
[03:56:54.280 --> 03:56:58.680]  oh, well, you know, let's just pretend that didn't happen. CNN isn't going to cover that.
[03:56:59.320 --> 03:57:04.600]  Hate crimes against Trump supporters. So if you're in the media and you're mad about me
[03:57:05.560 --> 03:57:10.760]  and you want to write little hate articles about me, I will tell you in the last 30 seconds,
[03:57:10.760 --> 03:57:15.640]  by the way, you can go to facebook.com forward slash Mike Sernovich to learn more.
[03:57:15.640 --> 03:57:21.640]  Here's how to beat Mike Sernovich. Do real journalism. Call out the violence against
[03:57:21.640 --> 03:57:27.320]  Trump supporters. Quit covering up Bill Clinton's rapes. Quit covering up for Al Franken. Quit
[03:57:27.320 --> 03:57:31.720]  trying to claim that Al Franken didn't really grow up as an air group. Quit covering up for
[03:57:31.720 --> 03:57:38.040]  Conyers. Quit worrying so much about me and Alex Jones and everybody else. Do real journalism.
[03:57:38.040 --> 03:57:52.520]  You have way more money than we do. You'll be able to run us out of business in a second.
