[02:12.320 --> 02:15.600]  the majority owner of clear channel and I don't hear Limbaugh or others
[02:15.600 --> 02:18.840]  criticizing Mitt Romney when they normally would I mean he's for abortion
[02:18.840 --> 02:25.360]  carbon taxes open borders a road Obamacare and people send me emails saying
[02:25.360 --> 02:30.320]  oh well he's against abortion now well yet now he says he is but when it comes
[02:30.320 --> 02:34.520]  to actually votes and support he wasn't and I hear well he's against open
[02:34.520 --> 02:39.920]  borders now that's a ruse to get the conservative vote he's just like all the
[02:39.920 --> 02:45.840]  other mainline rhinos he's for open borders just like Newt Gennrich and now

[03:25.760 --> 03:30.320]  market society and it's that juncture of government with that that's causing the
[03:30.320 --> 03:34.400]  destruction of our society and it's the mega banks that always launder and even
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.080]  administer the welfare systems and the phone banks and the rest of it to get
[03:38.080 --> 03:43.360]  the general welfare class on chicken feed to make them dependent so they can

[04:06.000 --> 04:11.920]  every head of the household and as much bread as you can eat and nobody's gonna
[04:11.920 --> 04:15.800]  rebel against the government and and by the end of the Roman Empire they would
[04:15.800 --> 04:19.280]  even first they made the poor people then the wealthy then the ultra rich you

[09:52.360 --> 09:59.160]  then borrow into news first the National Defense Authorization Act now the
[09:59.160 --> 10:02.840]  enemy ex-patriation act and we've been covering this for a few weeks but I want
[10:02.840 --> 10:06.640]  to break down what the government's gonna do they're just gonna say outside of a
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.400]  court well you're no longer a citizen so we can disappear you into a black hole
[10:11.400 --> 10:15.920]  but they've already got it on paper that they can kill citizens and disappear
[10:15.920 --> 10:20.520]  you into a spider hole into a devil dungeon so why are they doing this
[10:20.520 --> 10:24.640]  because they don't want to do that up front even though they claim they have
[10:24.640 --> 10:31.240]  this illegal unconstitutional power they want to finagle it and give it some
[10:31.240 --> 10:41.160]  cheap packaging and cover but some cheap camouflage that well we waved a magical
[10:41.160 --> 10:47.160]  wand and so you're no longer a citizen and can be renditioned off to some
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.440]  torture center so we're gonna be breaking that down systematic silence
[10:51.440 --> 10:56.520]  about NDAA proves a long plot to destroy America is real
[10:56.520 --> 11:01.920]  vindicating conspiracy theorist we're gonna be going over that report also a
[11:01.920 --> 11:10.080]  CNET news a division of CBS interactive DHS x-ray scanners could cause cancer oh
[11:10.080 --> 11:16.000]  but that's only for border crossers then you can't body scan them but you will
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.920]  body scan the citizens ladies and gentlemen we've had radiologists we've
[11:20.920 --> 11:27.960]  had scientists on for the last decade or so breaking down that they have people
[11:27.960 --> 11:33.080]  at the US border at the north and the south and now at domestic checkpoints
[11:33.080 --> 11:41.080]  inside the United States who drive through these x-ray machines now now
[11:41.080 --> 11:46.200]  previous to this a decade or so ago they had you get out they they had the
[11:46.200 --> 11:53.040]  border patrol people and technicians behind armored plate by armored you know
[11:53.040 --> 11:57.600]  lead that blocks out the x-rays they'd have the people get behind it with them
[11:57.600 --> 12:03.360]  in a holding room or off to the side and then they would roll the car up over
[12:03.360 --> 12:09.440]  the conveyor belt and x-ray it well just like prior to 1990 the military was not
[12:09.440 --> 12:13.160]  allowed to use depleted uranium weapons because they knew since the 50s it was
[12:13.160 --> 12:17.200]  deadly in the studies they done they had the weapons in case nuclear war already
[12:17.200 --> 12:22.720]  broke out troops are fighting 10 to 1 superiority at the but folder gap if the
[12:22.720 --> 12:26.040]  Russians rolled across into Germany they're in the Cold War it was an
[12:26.040 --> 12:33.120]  emergency weapon in emergency armories 1990 came around they said go ahead and
[12:33.120 --> 12:38.080]  use it just don't have the troops get close to tanks they've shot up with it
[12:38.080 --> 12:45.120]  not telling you that when you fire it out of a Abrams gun or out of a Marine
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.360]  Corps warrior vehicle or out of a Bradley fighting vehicle that it's
[12:49.360 --> 12:54.360]  igniting in the barrel and that you're getting a deadly dose as well sure it'll
[12:54.360 --> 12:57.560]  kill you 20 years later on average a horrible death kidneys failing tumors
[12:57.560 --> 13:02.440]  everywhere lung cancer but so what's a gift from the New World Order and it's
[13:02.440 --> 13:06.640]  the same thing here up until about a decade ago the border patrol and others
[13:06.640 --> 13:14.040]  always got behind the the ray shielding not now in fact in fact guys now that I
[13:14.040 --> 13:16.560]  thought about this I'm gonna do an assignment on air part of our total
[13:16.560 --> 13:21.960]  transparency program try to get me Watson our our our star writer already a
[13:21.960 --> 13:28.080]  lot of Kurt's right there Steve Aaron but Paul is the is the grand slam winner
[13:28.080 --> 13:33.280]  I mean he's the triple crown winner get me Watson online please just dial
[13:33.280 --> 13:37.600]  it seems like the number you call this home the way an answer I call the cell
[13:37.600 --> 13:41.920]  that's why I can always get him if you wanted it's the it's the first British
[13:41.920 --> 13:46.960]  number here's calling Skype see if he answers that okay I don't think that
[13:46.960 --> 13:51.560]  that he's not at his computer he won't see that but okay but the point is if we
[13:51.560 --> 13:58.800]  get Watson to write an article on this and and get the Fox Newspeed piece out
[13:58.800 --> 14:03.800]  of New York and a CBS news piece we've got out of Florida and past articles we
[14:03.800 --> 14:12.160]  did where it shows the army the army under TSA in all three newscast with
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.440]  giant mobile x-rays having families drive under it not just people at the
[14:17.440 --> 14:22.720]  border and the army soldiers under TSA control one of these is like four years
[14:22.720 --> 14:29.640]  old the first one I saw out of out of New York Fox News standing under the
[14:29.640 --> 14:39.960]  radiation machine standing under the radiation machine and of course it's
[14:39.960 --> 14:44.280]  bad for the family this is shooting through steel through aluminum and you
[14:44.280 --> 14:46.960]  can see the newscast where it shows people hidden in trunks and things are
[14:46.960 --> 14:52.200]  or guns as an example you can see their bodies it's shooting through a lot more
[14:52.200 --> 14:55.560]  powerful than some that shoots through your chest you know how bad a chest x-ray
[14:55.560 --> 15:03.320]  is but the real people being bar be cued bar be cued are the border patrol are
[15:03.320 --> 15:09.000]  the TSA are the military people but I'm in Vegas a few months ago coming back
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.880]  from an interview with Jesse Ventura and the guy goes I know who you are you're
[15:13.880 --> 15:17.560]  opting out I'm gonna have to grope you basically and I get no and I say you
[15:17.560 --> 15:22.180]  know that's a deadly radiation he says no it's not Alex they've given us the
[15:22.180 --> 15:26.120]  documents it's one one billionth of a cell phone call and I said really what
[15:26.120 --> 15:28.920]  are those measured in that's a different type of wavelength he was all
[15:28.920 --> 15:34.080]  whatever you just believe what you want he's like John Hopkins says it's not
[15:34.080 --> 15:38.840]  bad I said really I saw that report a few months ago earlier in the year did
[15:38.840 --> 15:41.400]  you know the head of John Hopkins radiology came out and said that there
[15:41.400 --> 15:44.920]  never was a study done with Homeland Security and that the study they did do
[15:44.920 --> 15:52.240]  said it does cause cancer and he goes whatever whatever the other TSA guys
[15:52.240 --> 15:57.040]  were looking at me like like kind of warily so I give this big speech about
[15:57.040 --> 16:02.280]  how they're all being fried I told him I'm gonna sue you if you touch even to
[16:02.280 --> 16:06.200]  the pants my genitals he didn't do it he said this stupid pat down and obviously
[16:06.200 --> 16:10.120]  knew who I was syndicated radio host no criminal record he's telling me he knows
[16:10.120 --> 16:14.320]  who I am he goes through this it's about you know 8 a.m. I've got about three
[16:14.320 --> 16:19.960]  hours sleep and I'm wanting to get on to my family and plus I kind of wanted to
[16:19.960 --> 16:23.360]  go through the test I wasn't intended to assume if they did and then to air the
[16:23.360 --> 16:28.600]  audio I was recording with the iPhone but he didn't really still like light
[16:28.600 --> 16:33.400]  frisk so I just said okay whatever we all know this is going on of course we're
[16:33.400 --> 16:39.800]  still doing it to children but the point is what happened 22 years ago or so
[16:39.800 --> 16:46.960]  where they said D use okay for the troops what happened the last decade
[16:46.960 --> 16:51.400]  where they just said have the border patrol have them all just stand there
[16:51.400 --> 16:55.240]  and before they drove the cars or 18 wheelers into a whole building and they
[16:55.240 --> 16:58.600]  still have some of those but they've now proliferated other checkpoints and
[16:58.600 --> 17:05.120]  units where it is a radiation spraying super high-powered x-ray machine and by
[17:05.120 --> 17:09.360]  the way I've seen the newscasts and videos and photos of this the border
[17:09.360 --> 17:15.600]  patrol aren't even wearing radiation badges highlights federal law they're

[18:40.200 --> 18:47.040]  situation here and so I want to explain to people it's not just the border
[18:47.040 --> 18:53.800]  crossers that they have drive under giant high-powered x-ray machines that
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.360]  are so powerful when they flip the switch you can you can actually hear it
[18:57.360 --> 19:04.960]  power up and beam and fry you that's that's horrible for the people going
[19:04.960 --> 19:08.960]  through it especially those that have to deliver back and forth on the border but
[19:08.960 --> 19:12.560]  but you know I think about the day where I pull up at one of these checkpoints
[19:12.560 --> 19:16.280]  run by the Army it violates Posse Comitatus it violates the 10th Amendment
[19:16.280 --> 19:20.200]  States Rights it violates the Fourth Amendment and they are gonna physically
[19:20.200 --> 19:25.120]  try to assault me and I've driven through checkpoints 99 miles into the
[19:25.120 --> 19:28.720]  country that's where they've got the one down in South Texas and I've never
[19:28.720 --> 19:32.520]  left the US they want to search my vehicle they got big x-ray machines
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.400]  there and I'm to stop them to stop them from trying to barbecue me and my
[19:36.400 --> 19:41.440]  family I've got to stand up to the pack of hyenas and again I'm not saying the
[19:41.440 --> 19:46.800]  board patrol are bad themselves but in their role they're hyenas and I've got
[19:46.800 --> 19:50.800]  to stand up to them and preach at them and be laughed at by them let me tell
[19:50.800 --> 19:56.640]  you something when you're diagnosed with cancer I know you're gonna be pretty

[24:22.080 --> 24:30.560]  and every breath you take you know it upsets me I mean I get angry of thinking
[24:30.560 --> 24:42.680]  about the collective insanity of our society that we let the crazy control
[24:42.680 --> 24:51.720]  freaks that run our government let the troops use depleted uranium it's a
[24:51.720 --> 24:55.680]  death sentence and that we have to pay for as they degenerate and die that
[24:55.680 --> 24:58.920]  they're setting up x-ray systems not just at airports but all over the country
[24:58.920 --> 25:03.360]  that in fact I've seen news articles out now admitting they have helicopters and
[25:03.360 --> 25:07.080]  aircraft beaming with ground penetrating radar looking through our
[25:07.080 --> 25:13.440]  houses they've got mobile police units looking through our walls they've got
[25:13.440 --> 25:18.440]  police with backpack units that look through your walls blasting high-powered
[25:18.440 --> 25:25.200]  waves and because the defense companies want to sell these products they just
[25:25.200 --> 25:34.480]  have government wave of magic wand and say that it's okay so what I want Paul
[25:34.480 --> 25:41.240]  Watson to do because I know he's listening what I want Paul Watson to do
[25:41.240 --> 25:46.560]  we do now have up is Paul we need to explain and have some article that
[25:46.560 --> 25:50.600]  we're all being bathed and then speculate on why the system doesn't care
[25:50.600 --> 25:55.600]  because the military neutral complex makes money whatever with the DU but
[25:55.600 --> 26:00.440]  but I mean mainly tie it in though with finally you know CBS News reporting hey
[26:00.440 --> 26:03.560]  these border patrol x-ray machines could be given people that are going under
[26:03.560 --> 26:07.760]  them cancer no kidding what about the border patrol and then that Fox News
[26:07.760 --> 26:12.080]  piece out of New York and other places where it shows the military out under
[26:12.080 --> 26:17.320]  TSA you know we were that we were put on like four years ago showing the families
[26:17.320 --> 26:23.240]  drive under it I mean this is sheer madness Paul and I understand you're
[26:23.240 --> 26:28.240]  gonna say Alex we've reported on this probably 50 times I know but now once
[26:28.240 --> 26:36.040]  the great Lord CBS reports on it now the sheeple you can say as CBS is now
[26:36.040 --> 26:39.280]  telling you they've known about this for a long time here's the full story
[26:39.280 --> 26:44.200]  because only after the reality controllers tell us something is it
[26:44.200 --> 26:49.080]  actually real and see now people will actually listen now that they want the
[26:49.080 --> 26:56.440]  sheep to know this Paul Watson your take on this well it was reported in Forbes
[26:56.440 --> 27:03.080]  magazine in nearly a year ago that online security is far back as 2006 had
[27:03.080 --> 27:09.400]  got plans to have these roving vans on which x-ray scanners were mounted back
[27:09.400 --> 27:14.960]  scatter x-ray scanners that would just randomly scan crowds of people at
[27:14.960 --> 27:19.960]  sports events and basically just on the highway and street corners so the fact
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.680]  that they're using it at border checkpoints when they're already using
[27:24.680 --> 27:29.600]  it at truck stops on highways is par for the course because it's already been
[27:29.600 --> 27:34.000]  announced and imagine you pull up they've got idiots that work there who
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.120]  have got death sentences their gums are probably already bleeding from the
[27:38.120 --> 27:42.160]  radiation you know their fast-growing cells are already probably you know
[27:42.160 --> 27:44.720]  they're wondering why their teeth are falling out and they're like you gonna
[27:44.720 --> 27:49.280]  go in it with your family that no I'm not that's assault you idiot and just
[27:49.280 --> 27:52.880]  because you want to kill yourself doesn't mean you're gonna kill my family
[27:52.880 --> 27:56.920]  you moron scum what do you say to them Paul because they're setting the same
[27:56.920 --> 28:03.440]  stuff up in England right now well it's it's only the next stage I mean they've
[28:03.440 --> 28:10.320]  already got planned mobile interrogation booms where if you want to go into an
[28:10.320 --> 28:15.560]  expo or a sports event or any kind of public event first I only do you have
[28:15.560 --> 28:20.400]  to submit to the body scan you also have to submit to an interrogation from a
[28:20.400 --> 28:25.520]  Homeland Security official to make sure you're not a terrorist so if people
[28:25.520 --> 28:30.320]  think that you know if I avoid flying and then it becomes if I avoid getting a
[28:30.320 --> 28:34.800]  bus if I avoid getting a train if I avoid leaving my house then maybe I can
[28:34.800 --> 28:40.200]  escape this but you can't it's taking over your whole life and it needs to
[28:40.200 --> 28:45.600]  stop now I mean Europe's largely banned the certain type of x-ray body scanner
[28:45.600 --> 28:50.320]  because I mean even if they wanted to do this there are x-ray there are body
[28:50.320 --> 28:56.400]  scanners which use a certain type of transmission so only uses them in their
[28:56.400 --> 29:02.480]  in their construction plants which don't throw out harmful radiation they're
[29:02.480 --> 29:07.360]  available and yet they choose to use the ones that John Hopkins and other
[29:07.360 --> 29:13.760]  scientists there's one quoted in this CNET report said will cause cancer but
[29:13.760 --> 29:18.200]  but what does the TSA do when John Hopkins comes out and says it'll kill you
[29:18.200 --> 29:24.040]  TSA takes their report and says it doesn't hurt you oh precisely and then
[29:24.040 --> 29:28.640]  there was the leaked case out of one of the airports where they found a they
[29:28.640 --> 29:33.120]  found yeah they found a cluster of cancer cases from TSA screeners oh I want
[29:33.120 --> 29:36.240]  to give you the floor for five minutes since I roused you out of writing to
[29:36.240 --> 29:38.960]  to break down the spectrum of this then I'm going to phone calls and all the
[29:38.960 --> 29:44.320]  other news but this type of issue illustrates the the collective lunacy
[29:44.320 --> 29:50.200]  and insanity going on the TSA agents are all killing themselves we're on the

[33:49.000 --> 33:54.400]  and exponentially more every week because I'm a real person just like you
[33:54.400 --> 34:01.760]  and I'm angry and it freaks me out to watch criminals on national news talk
[34:01.760 --> 34:06.040]  about how much they love the troops and how honorable they are and then attach
[34:06.040 --> 34:12.840]  the heroic honor of the military because regardless they're facing
[34:12.840 --> 34:16.800]  danger and many of them believe they're doing the right thing attach that
[34:16.800 --> 34:23.880]  mantle onto these criminal anti-american globalist politician pimps
[34:23.880 --> 34:30.720]  mercenaries and then to talk to the troops in person and to watch the c-span
[34:30.720 --> 34:37.760]  hearings 15 16 17 years ago with tens of thousands dying from DU poisoning and
[34:37.760 --> 34:42.120]  the VA trying to block it and then learning that the local veterans groups
[34:42.120 --> 34:46.240]  won't help troops when they come back in her sick so they just commit suicide and
[34:46.240 --> 34:51.680]  to know there's seven times the previous record of suicides and but no no no
[34:51.680 --> 34:55.760]  if you're a patriot you're supposed to just not talk about that you're just
[34:55.760 --> 35:02.760]  supposed to tell the troops go home and die and now they're putting in body
[35:02.760 --> 35:07.560]  scanners everywhere and saying that mobile trucks on the streets and and I've
[35:07.560 --> 35:13.120]  got videos from around the country it's not getting news it's local news local
[35:13.120 --> 35:18.840]  news of families in the middle of states a hundred miles from the border or more
[35:18.840 --> 35:25.080]  not even at border patrol checkpoints national guard under TSA with state
[35:25.080 --> 35:30.160]  police with submachine guns and you pull up and the military standing there
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.200]  five feet from the big scanner wand sticking out from a truck with cars with
[35:35.200 --> 35:41.480]  families rolling under it listen punk you try to assault me and my family I
[35:41.480 --> 35:45.160]  pulled one of those checkpoints I'm done you're not gonna hurt my children
[35:45.160 --> 35:49.520]  just because you're a moron just because you follow orders you know the
[35:49.520 --> 35:52.600]  government told you to stick your hand in a garbage disposal and flip the switch
[35:52.600 --> 35:55.720]  would you do it if the government told you to shoot yourself in the head would
[35:55.720 --> 36:00.760]  you do it they told you to jump off a cliff would you do it I mean I am sane
[36:00.760 --> 36:07.680]  okay those of you that go along with the system are insane and I understand a
[36:07.680 --> 36:11.000]  world of insane people that have been incrementally taught to go along with
[36:11.000 --> 36:16.360]  anything a sane person an angry person sounds crazy no I'm as sane as the day
[36:16.360 --> 36:22.920]  is long and I'm angry and I don't like what's happening you know I've had those
[36:22.920 --> 36:34.400]  discussions with my family I've had those discussions with my family
[36:35.800 --> 36:41.840]  about whether you know do we leave the country or not and I've said we're
[36:41.840 --> 36:45.800]  staying we're not gonna give up the fight and I'm watching V for Vendetta this
[36:45.800 --> 36:50.120]  morning and it's got the scene where she's sitting there talking about well my
[36:50.120 --> 36:53.760]  mom wanted to leave the country but my dad didn't he said we didn't want to
[36:53.760 --> 36:57.000]  lose if they would win like it was a game that it shows them bust the door
[36:57.000 --> 37:01.000]  down and grab people guys I wanted to play a clip from that today during the
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.280]  third hour I don't know we'll have time now to get it off the DVD because I
[37:04.280 --> 37:08.120]  forgot coming in well somebody run around and look on the tables out there
[37:08.120 --> 37:14.760]  or maybe in my car over my keys are at for V for Vendetta I want the scene in
[37:14.760 --> 37:24.640]  there where they meet with V and he's sitting there talking and no it's yeah
[37:24.640 --> 37:29.080]  thanks and and they don't know it's a V in disguise and he's explaining to the
[37:29.080 --> 37:34.200]  police how the government released the bio weapon itself to create martial law
[37:34.200 --> 37:38.440]  and blame it on their enemies and then also made profit from the drug that
[37:38.440 --> 37:42.360]  they'd already developed to treat it that's what happened with the anthrax in
[37:42.360 --> 37:47.440]  the antibiotic they had that the Cipro that came right out that all the
[37:47.440 --> 37:51.600]  globalists made the money off of just unbelievable how they operate I mean
[37:51.600 --> 37:56.640]  there's no end to these people and we're going to face this as a society and
[37:56.640 --> 38:00.720]  last night I don't let my children watch mainline TV but I let them watch stuff
[38:00.720 --> 38:06.440]  like Andy Griffin we were watching one called Andy Griffin discovers America
[38:06.440 --> 38:12.320]  and it's this whole speech about 1776 and Liberty and the Second Amendment we
[38:12.320 --> 38:14.800]  were letting the children watch this at about seven o'clock at night my wife
[38:14.800 --> 38:20.600]  looked at me she said man television's really changed yeah yeah they got a new
[38:20.600 --> 38:25.560]  TV show coming out on primetime where the toddler uses the F word which is
[38:25.560 --> 38:30.040]  supposed to be shocking and funny it's about getting rid of any morals and it's
[38:30.040 --> 38:34.640]  about the fun of degrading things not the fun of learning knowledge okay I'm
[38:34.640 --> 38:38.680]  going to your calls I want to go back to Watson Watson you've got the floor for
[38:38.680 --> 38:43.120]  five minutes to go over the history of these naked body scanners and the rest
[38:43.120 --> 38:46.680]  of it then I'm going to come back and go to calls but break down the
[38:46.680 --> 38:52.160]  proliferation of this without me interrupting well a recent article I
[38:52.160 --> 38:57.680]  wrote is the fact that they are Viper teams which is the TSA agents who will
[38:57.680 --> 39:03.880]  be conducting these border and highway scanning checkpoints they've already got
[39:03.880 --> 39:09.400]  25 of them they've had 9,300 unannounced checkpoints over the
[39:09.400 --> 39:16.720]  course of 2011 the study that they did into them found that they thwarted no
[39:16.720 --> 39:22.400]  terrorist plots they influenced no you know they had no influence on public
[39:22.400 --> 39:27.880]  safety completely worthless and yet Congress last month authorized another
[39:27.880 --> 39:37.240]  24 million dollars to create 12 new Viper checkpoint teams so these 9,300
[39:37.240 --> 39:41.720]  checkpoints manning these x-ray scanners are only going to increase in 2012
[39:41.720 --> 39:46.560]  which is why they've expanded them out from the airport to bus stations, ferry
[39:46.560 --> 39:53.360]  terminals, train stations we even had TSA people a prom night remember that
[39:53.360 --> 39:59.000]  story and of course on the highway so basically any public place whatsoever
[39:59.000 --> 40:04.640]  even though the study has proven that you know they prevent they don't even
[40:04.640 --> 40:08.320]  prevent a threat to public safety never mind terrorism so they're completely
[40:08.320 --> 40:14.000]  worthless and then the ultimate goal of course is to have these roving body
[40:14.000 --> 40:20.080]  scanners which British Dutch authorities were talking about four or five years ago
[40:20.080 --> 40:26.480]  where they could in fact install them on lamp post street lights which is very
[40:26.480 --> 40:30.120]  interesting considering the fact that IntelliStreets have come out with the
[40:30.120 --> 40:36.040]  new Orwellian street lights which record conversations they double as CCTV
[40:36.040 --> 40:42.320]  cameras billboards for homeland security few mongering announcements so it's all
[40:42.320 --> 40:47.840]  geared towards putting these mobile naked body scanners either in street lights
[40:47.840 --> 40:53.640]  or on these roving vans which go around your street go down the highways and
[40:53.640 --> 40:58.040]  just randomly scan crowds of people completely against the fourth
[40:58.040 --> 41:02.520]  amendment completely unsafe all these top doctors have come out and said that
[41:02.520 --> 41:07.000]  it leads to an increase in cancer and then when they do that the TSA just
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.840]  comes back and says no John Hopkins said that there were no links to cancer
[41:11.840 --> 41:16.200]  whatsoever even though they said the opposite and then you've got Columbia
[41:16.200 --> 41:21.800]  University University of California interagency committee on radiation safety
[41:21.800 --> 41:28.120]  which is the premier radiation safety organization in the world you've got MIT
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.440]  you've got all these universities who come out and say no it's not safe and it
[41:32.440 --> 41:37.320]  is going to lead to an increase in cancer and then the TSA always comes back
[41:37.320 --> 41:42.840]  DHS and just says no they said that it's safe so they just brazenly lie to the
[41:42.840 --> 41:48.400]  public time and time again and now we've got this new story out of CNET which is
[41:48.400 --> 41:53.240]  related to the board as DHS x-ray scanners can be cancer risk to board
[41:53.240 --> 41:59.120]  across us so now it's going to be in that context and it's unfolding out to
[41:59.120 --> 42:05.040]  every context of public life as the TSA becomes this occupying army now they've
[42:05.040 --> 42:11.680]  got the FPS the federal bureau protective service which is basically the
[42:11.680 --> 42:17.200]  DHS is occupying Gestapo force they turned up at a Florida social security
[42:17.200 --> 42:23.640]  office just over a week ago and started checking people's IDs these DHS goons on
[42:23.640 --> 42:29.600]  with semi-automatic guns while others you know drove around the block cased the
[42:29.600 --> 42:36.040]  joint in DHS cars so it's literally I've called it an occupying force and it
[42:36.040 --> 42:41.640]  just manifests itself in more of those precise ways as we go along well you know
[42:41.640 --> 42:45.680]  it's martial law being rolled out incrementally until you're there and
[42:45.680 --> 42:50.440]  it's all about setting the precedent to totally take over our society and every
[42:50.440 --> 42:54.560]  movie you watch about an authoritarian society or every documentary you watch
[42:54.560 --> 42:59.160]  about real authoritarian societies this is it they're not even trying to hide it
[42:59.160 --> 43:03.400]  and there are a bunch of crooks that deal drugs and ship guns into Mexico and
[43:03.400 --> 43:06.760]  engage in every other crime you can imagine there's no doubt we have a
[43:06.760 --> 43:12.800]  treasonous criminal group running the government and I mean remember the story
[43:12.800 --> 43:18.880]  about they were talking about fitting people passengers on airplanes completely
[43:18.880 --> 43:24.560]  innocent travelers going on the vacation with taser shock bracelets so
[43:24.560 --> 43:30.440]  anytime some official in a position of authority got got scared they could just
[43:30.440 --> 43:35.160]  shock the entire plane into submission I mean these are the kind of ideas that
[43:35.160 --> 43:40.280]  these control freaks come out with and go and watch the video for the fast
[43:40.280 --> 43:47.520]  screening program DHS which is where they erect all these mobile units outside
[43:47.520 --> 43:51.880]  public events and they literally interrogate every single person before
[43:51.880 --> 43:57.080]  they're allowed into the event it's a behavioral analysis of their facial
[43:57.080 --> 44:00.920]  reactions when they're asked certain questions and that technology is now
[44:00.920 --> 44:05.240]  being announced is already in some airports and is is going in many of the
[44:05.240 --> 44:10.960]  major airports so every incremental step just gets crazier and crazier and
[44:10.960 --> 44:16.000]  it outstrips anything that you could read about in all wells 1984 but it's to
[44:16.000 --> 44:19.160]  keep us safe from the Al Qaeda that's been given control of Libya and is being
[44:19.160 --> 44:22.520]  funded to attack Syria thank you Paul Watson great report I want to get a
[44:22.520 --> 44:26.720]  big report out explaining to people that the system knows that they're giving
[44:26.720 --> 44:30.960]  people cancer with these scanners and maybe some screenshots of the different
[44:30.960 --> 44:34.680]  newscasts showing the families driving under the scanners with the military
[44:34.680 --> 44:40.040]  standing there it being barbecued thank you Paul Watson thanks all right now I
[44:40.040 --> 44:43.400]  know I said I'd go to your calls and we are going to your calls we're gonna go
[44:43.400 --> 44:47.640]  to Ezekiel and then we're gonna go to Pat and then we're gonna go to Chris
[44:47.640 --> 44:52.200]  Chuck Sean and others Ezekiel in Kentucky thanks for holding I went to go
[44:52.200 --> 44:56.680]  to your calls earlier but I went crazy thinking about the cancer from all these
[44:56.680 --> 44:59.920]  scanners going in and how they know it's killing people and just how
[44:59.920 --> 45:06.040]  psychopathically evil this is Ezekiel welcome thank you that three quick
[45:06.040 --> 45:10.920]  questions for you in a comment first about chemtrails last week over Southwest
[45:10.920 --> 45:15.600]  Ohio I witnessed the worst chemtrail I never ever seen I counted at least 18
[45:15.600 --> 45:20.840]  high altitude sprayers before I lost track I got some pictures but I'm
[45:20.840 --> 45:24.360]  starting to believe now that they're using drones for this because I've been
[45:24.360 --> 45:28.880]  observing this for almost 10 years now and recently I've been trying to use a
[45:28.880 --> 45:33.200]  10x binoculars to observe these planes and even with binoculars I still kind of
[45:33.200 --> 45:37.560]  get a clear visual on these crafts the first question is do you think there's a
[45:37.560 --> 45:42.120]  connection between chemtrails and project blue beam and do you think project
[45:42.120 --> 45:46.480]  blue beam could be implemented this year I appreciate your call project blue
[45:46.480 --> 45:50.280]  beam is a government program that part of it's been leaked to have a fake alien
[45:50.280 --> 45:53.600]  invasion to make the public do whatever the government says it's a form of
[45:53.600 --> 45:58.160]  false flag staged event I don't know I know Hollywood's always getting the
[45:58.160 --> 46:01.520]  public ready for that I know world leaders have said that it can be used
[46:01.520 --> 46:05.360]  someday as for chemtrails there's a whole bunch of different programs there's
[46:05.360 --> 46:10.320]  low altitude high altitude the government admits that there are thousands
[46:10.320 --> 46:16.000]  of government tests going on for weather modification but 99% of the activist
[46:16.000 --> 46:20.200]  community never looks at any of the admissions they just speculate but
[46:20.200 --> 46:25.200]  there's films on it we've covered it there is a geoengineering program going
[46:25.200 --> 46:29.240]  on the White House science are admits they are Pat in New York you're on the
[46:29.240 --> 46:37.480]  year welcome good sir I just wanted to get a little round Paul is out there I
[46:37.480 --> 46:41.720]  actually just saw a video I didn't believe it was yesterday Tom Woods was
[46:41.720 --> 46:45.720]  talking about Operation Grandma I don't know if you heard about this no tell me
[46:45.720 --> 46:50.960]  about it it's about it's about getting it's about talking to your grandparents
[46:50.960 --> 46:53.640]  you know your grandmother's and grandparents about Ron Paul because
[46:53.640 --> 46:58.040]  most of the time you know they get most of that news from CNN Fox News all the
[46:58.040 --> 47:01.840]  mainstream media channels and you know my grandma has a computer in the house
[47:01.840 --> 47:05.840]  but she like never uses it and you know she always talks about oh Obama's
[47:05.840 --> 47:10.840]  doing good but you know if Congress only worked with them and you know and and I
[47:10.840 --> 47:13.960]  started telling her about Ron Paul and how he's the only one that's not
[47:13.960 --> 47:19.640]  corruptible and just all this stuff and Operation Grandma Thomas Woods actually
[47:19.640 --> 47:22.920]  talks about it I just wanted to get that out there so you're saying go over to
[47:22.920 --> 47:27.600]  grandma's house get her computer working and show her on Paul videos exactly
[47:27.600 --> 47:31.400]  either that or just talk to her about about rock already yeah I agree that's
[47:31.400 --> 47:36.200]  how you defeat tyrants is everybody talking to everybody everybody reaching
[47:36.200 --> 47:38.960]  out to each other and pointing out what's going on great points good to hear
[47:38.960 --> 47:43.520]  from you let's go ahead and talk to Chuck in Michigan Chuck you're on the year
[47:43.520 --> 47:49.160]  hey how you doing Alex I'm doing great brother how about you I'm actually
[47:49.160 --> 47:53.000]  seeing some snow for the first time here in Michigan because they haven't sprayed
[47:53.000 --> 47:57.680]  for the past five days so but that's that's for another time I want to talk
[47:57.680 --> 48:03.080]  about how this is my personal belief that Chicago is gonna be turned to the
[48:03.080 --> 48:07.440]  Warsaw ghetto due to the fact that it's a transportation hub and they keep wanting
[48:07.440 --> 48:12.800]  to do all this high-speed rail and as it is all the rail lines and an entire
[48:12.800 --> 48:18.280]  country stem from Chicago well a Indiana based news outfit called the
[48:18.280 --> 48:23.960]  newspaper I interviewed a right on the border Indiana County Commissioner and
[48:23.960 --> 48:29.520]  I learned the guy's identity but obviously we voice changed him and you
[48:29.520 --> 48:32.760]  know everything when we got him on air one time for short interview we was
[48:32.760 --> 48:37.000]  taped interviewing and he also another interview but and I've since confirmed
[48:37.000 --> 48:40.280]  it and now a lot of it's actually come out they've been training for for
[48:40.280 --> 48:46.520]  millions of dead walking down Chicago in the surrounding counties around it
[48:46.520 --> 48:51.600]  and around Illinois for a long time go ahead right why why else would the
[48:51.600 --> 48:56.440]  president's right-hand man Rob a manual take a job as a mayor you know I mean
[48:56.440 --> 48:59.720]  that makes no sense whatsoever unless something sinister is up
[48:59.720 --> 49:05.040]  Lincoln Grandstand is the savior when the terrorists head yeah yeah the boogie
[49:05.040 --> 49:09.800]  man who lives 5,000 miles away anyways I also wanted to talk a little quick
[49:09.800 --> 49:13.240]  story about something that happened to me at the VA hospital about about a year
[49:13.240 --> 49:19.840]  ago I was down there and I've seen a TSA agent and you know I got kind of a
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.080]  smart mouth and I said something to him I said so how many how many times you
[49:24.080 --> 49:29.600]  stuck your hand on a five-year-old's pants this week and this guy like he was
[49:29.600 --> 49:32.640]  about to swing on me and he started he started to push me and I just kept
[49:32.640 --> 49:36.040]  backing up luckily the VA police came and escorted this guy but this guy was
[49:36.040 --> 49:42.400]  screaming at me like he wanted to kill me and I mean this guy well how many have
[49:42.400 --> 49:47.640]  been busted now raping kids and dealing drugs and robbing people and I mean it's
[49:47.640 --> 49:52.800]  just look only an idiot would take that job or a criminal oh yeah this guy was
[49:52.800 --> 49:56.960]  this guy had total anger issues and I mean it's all about his power over
[49:56.960 --> 50:01.680]  people he's gonna enjoy the power of being barbecued by that radiation yes
[50:01.680 --> 50:07.200]  sir I just I just I luckily the VA police were on my side they seem to be
[50:07.200 --> 50:13.760]  okay down there because most of them are expats too so so he didn't like you I
[50:13.760 --> 50:16.400]  ask you about sticking his hand down five-year-olds pants I mean that's his
[50:16.400 --> 50:21.280]  profession I mean I mean literally the psychologist or in mainstream news
[50:21.280 --> 50:26.400]  saying it's teaching kids to let pedophiles like Sandusky I guess have
[50:26.400 --> 50:30.320]  their way it's it's like that testing they reportedly do and so kids that have
[50:30.320 --> 50:34.460]  been trained to be touched well now it's it's it's I guess fair game and you're
[50:34.460 --> 50:39.760]  not you know you're not supposed to in a free country have people grow up in your
[50:39.760 --> 50:45.480]  children's genitals but it's all part of globalist training slave training great

[54:55.360 --> 55:00.000]  till now we just think about all the stuff that's there it's all designed for
[55:00.000 --> 55:07.480]  mine rot basically into dumb the population down one of my biggest
[55:07.480 --> 55:18.140]  problems is is that I tend to I tend to focus on just the news propaganda but
[55:18.140 --> 55:23.600]  the real propaganda is embedded in the culture in the video games in the TV
[55:23.600 --> 55:28.120]  that's where you see it let's go ahead and go to Sean Illinois Sean you're on
[55:28.120 --> 55:33.920]  the air hey how's it going Alex hey buddy
[55:33.920 --> 55:37.560]  how's it going yeah I just want to touch base so you guys were talking about how
[55:37.560 --> 55:42.200]  you know they have these scanners now and you know the government denies the
[55:42.200 --> 55:46.920]  fact that they they cause cancer that takes you all back to you know about like
[55:46.920 --> 55:51.800]  50 years back when they spray DDT they spray it from 1945 to 1970 they were
[55:51.800 --> 55:54.600]  saying that at the time was actually perfectly healthy with nothing wrong
[55:54.600 --> 55:59.080]  with that and then you know years later they got people popular with cancer and
[55:59.080 --> 56:03.040]  stuff and they banned it completely and my dad actually a while back was
[56:03.040 --> 56:06.320]  talking about this and there's a video I think it's under the rise and fall of
[56:06.320 --> 56:11.480]  DDT on YouTube it actually shows a scientist who says oh there's there's
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.040]  nothing wrong with this and he's eating DDT you're literally eating pills of
[56:15.040 --> 56:18.600]  this to prove that there's nothing wrong with it but come to find out it causes
[56:18.600 --> 56:22.560]  cancer the same kind of thing that's going on here like you got the scientists
[56:22.560 --> 56:26.040]  saying you know this isn't going to do anything to you but that's what they were
[56:26.040 --> 56:29.680]  saying back then that guy probably died of that kind of sickness you know well
[56:29.680 --> 56:35.760]  to be clear I've studied DDT in depth so it's a little of both the eugenicist
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.960]  wanted to ban it because it was saving about 15 million lives a year but it did
[56:40.960 --> 56:45.560]  have some toxicity and so the chemical company said it was perfectly fine they
[56:45.560 --> 56:49.480]  showed kids playing in it with the DDT trucks driving around my mother in
[56:49.480 --> 56:52.960]  Austin growing up you know that they would run behind the trucks with the DDT
[56:52.960 --> 56:59.400]  spraying out of it and that was shown on the newsreels but at the same time then
[56:59.400 --> 57:03.400]  when they banned it because it's such an inexpensive poison it did cause massive
[57:03.400 --> 57:07.720]  death so there's a cost-benefit analysis there but what about Agent Orange what
[57:07.720 --> 57:14.840]  about the vaccines with cancer viruses in them again a lot of this is on purpose
[57:14.840 --> 57:19.240]  I feel like in 50 years from now we're gonna look back and they're gonna say
[57:19.240 --> 57:22.360]  like all this stuff you know we hear people calling on the radio station
[57:22.360 --> 57:25.840]  about chemtrails it's such a big deal here in Illinois I see a woman on that
[57:25.840 --> 57:29.960]  daily basis outside of my house like tons of them too just littering the sky I
[57:29.960 --> 57:33.080]  feel like in 50 years now people are gonna look back and say the government
[57:33.080 --> 57:37.120]  can say yeah we made a mistake it caused you know these kind of problems and we
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.240]  shouldn't have done it's gonna be just like the DDT type of thing
[57:41.240 --> 57:46.480]  well I agree with you and I appreciate your call look expanding on that we'll
[57:46.480 --> 57:51.760]  come back and take a few more calls and Gerald Solente is gonna join us expanding
[57:51.760 --> 58:00.040]  on that a lot of times the threats they tell us about are minor issues or there
[58:00.040 --> 58:04.000]  are things that the patent is running out on and the establishment wants to
[58:04.000 --> 58:09.360]  charge you a lot more for something like when the patent on Freon ran out they
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.800]  had new systems to replace it so they banned it claiming it was destroying the
[58:12.800 --> 58:18.400]  ozone layer but one thing I know about the global controllers they could care
[58:18.400 --> 58:27.000]  less about this planet I mean I go back to the 60s where they detonated the US
[58:27.000 --> 58:32.280]  alone hundreds of high-powered hydrogen bombs in the upper atmosphere and it's
[58:32.280 --> 58:36.600]  even on the history channel to see if they could ignite the planet's atmosphere

[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.400]  bit different there let's talk to Chris in north carolina
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:09.240]  Chris you're on the air hey thank you alex can hear me all right yes I can
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:12.680]  welcome I just wanted to say a couple things first
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:17.800]  exposing the liar Mitt Romney I think it was about last spring he made a
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:21.400]  speech where he said that corporations should be people
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:25.480]  then he said that he likes to fire people and he tried to defend that by
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:29.640]  saying he didn't mean people he meant insurance corporations sort of that
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:34.680]  circular insanity well Mitt Romney you know admits that he has
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:37.560]  been connected to groups that got banker bailouts
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:40.520]  and we played that club yesterday where lucordowski asked him about it I mean
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.160]  Mitt Romney is for carbon taxes for heaven's sakes
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.200]  and now he gets up there and says he's against abortion and stuff the
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.680]  establishment put obama in because that's what they want
[01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:57.320]  the establishment wants to put Mitt Romney in because that's what they want
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:01.640]  I mean it's so elementary if you want the status quo which is tyranny and
[01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:05.160]  corruption vote for anybody but Ron poll but I mean it's just it's
[01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:09.320]  completely elementary on the police state from north
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:12.680]  carolina uh january 1st they just passed the law
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.000]  you get a DUI with passengers in the car it's 30 days in jail
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.160]  no questions asked if they pull you over now or come to your house
[01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.840]  because they've had a complaint about a party and anybody has drugs on them
[01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:28.280]  they go to everybody's house that's at the party and
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.720]  and if you get pulled over in your car they go to your house now I don't know
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:35.080]  what they're using to justify that but it's a common
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.840]  so everybody well I want to hear about this show so they pull you over and
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:42.760]  somebody's got some marijuana in the car uh the George Washington grew and
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:47.960]  smoked they they but total drug war by the people
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.000]  that bring it in it's so amazing they then go to your house
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:55.560]  tell me about this uh well I had a friend who got pulled over
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.000]  a couple weeks ago he had five grams of marijuana on him
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.480]  and they you know they you know I don't know that they're doing it legally
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.240]  he kept complying with them which is probably the problem but you know how
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:09.640]  it is I had another friend that was having a
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:14.360]  party they came to the place uh because of a complaint about the
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:17.320]  noise somebody there had some cocaine on them I
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.920]  guess but they went to everybody's house that was at the party
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.960]  uh they used they just tell you they're going to detain you
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.120]  until they get a warrant to come to your house that's North Carolina
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:32.440]  uh well they want to know where the cocaine is it's uh
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.040]  most the police chiefs in every area are the main drug dealer I mean I
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.400]  mean they're there to make sure all the all of it goes well I mean
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:43.720]  I mean is it again they're the drug dealers and they have their low level
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:47.000]  minions go out and then enslave you when you buy
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.840]  their product to pay them more money yes it's uh
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.160]  not may bury any longer buddy thank you so much appreciate the points
[01:03:55.160 --> 01:03:57.880]  we won't have time to go another caller in this segment but I'll

[01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:19.720]  good friend of mine Gerald Salente here in a moment
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.360]  here's a big story we haven't really gotten to yet that's very important
[01:08:24.360 --> 01:08:27.960]  the Jerusalem Post is reporting on this we have some of the back story
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.640]  on it at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:35.160]  ex-israeli intelligence officer pearl harbour
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.840]  style attack will be pretext for war with Iran what is the former top ca
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.560]  analyst to Ronald Reagan and George Robert Walker Bush said
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:47.800]  Ray McGovern same thing Jerusalem post article implies us will stage
[01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.320]  provocation to justify military assault
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.640]  all joseph watson info wars.com former Israeli intelligence officer
[01:08:55.640 --> 01:09:00.760]  avie perry writes that a surprise pearl harbour style Iranian attack
[01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:04.280]  on an american warship in the persian gulf will provide the pretext
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:08.360]  for the u.s to launch all out warfare against iran
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:11.880]  given the fact that former vice president dick cheney's office
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.440]  openly considered staging a false flag attack on a u.s vessel in the persian
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:21.320]  gulf to blame it on iran as a pretext for war
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.880]  perry's summation of how 2012 will see a new war cannot be taken lightly
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.120]  under the headline looming war with iran perry writes
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:34.040]  and it goes over it all i just want to say something here
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.680]  iran, israel, china, russia, the u.s, england they're all run by mafias
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.200]  and all of these big mafias the world's gotten a very corrupt cycle i only get
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.920]  jreltslint's take on this is why i'm raising it
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:49.240]  studying history we've gotten a very corrupt cycle worldwide
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:53.640]  and as the corruption goes to seed and the society starts collapsing
[01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:57.800]  the criminals are going to steal even faster because they have nothing to lose
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.080]  now and that's what always accelerates tyranny
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.520]  into the absurdist realm which is now happening
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:07.880]  but tyrants always wrap themselves in the flag
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.400]  if anybody criticizes them they say oh you're just anti german or
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.600]  you're anti russian or you're anti israel or you're anti
[01:10:14.600 --> 01:10:18.120]  england or you're anti china or you're anti america
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.720]  it's the same formulas the same tricks the same playbooks
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:24.760]  they all cheat each other as well these big fortune 100
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:30.440]  they're a bunch of crooks as jreltslint's pointed out
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:34.040]  and the point is the crooks won a big war
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:37.080]  as jreltslint said a year ago he said as things accelerate
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.880]  as things implode look for the first great war that was his trend of 2011 his
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.680]  top trend back in january of last year now he has
[01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:48.680]  his new big trends journal out you can get a trends journal
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:53.160]  website if you want to find out a lot more and we have the

[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.720]  wanted enemy of the state jreltslint wanted for speaking the truth
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:14.760]  this is just a black and white print off from our computer we might show the
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:18.840]  color one later and it says america with a k usa
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:23.000]  by department of homeland security and joining us for the rest of the hour
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:27.240]  uh is jreltslint jerald great to have you on with us my friend
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:31.400]  oh it's always a pleasure being on with you alex so
[01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:35.240]  they now admit that there's a war already going on what we knew years ago
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:39.640]  covertly in iran things are escalating uh what's what's on the front burner for
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:43.080]  jreltslint right now out of the gates what's most important
[01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:47.000]  it is iran it's number one there are two number ones there
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.040]  it's what's going on in europe the meltdown of the
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:54.840]  european economic union and the iranian war that they're building up they
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.480]  declared war alex uh with obama when he signed on christ
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:03.800]  new year's eve the national defense authorization act
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:07.640]  he also declared war against iran essentially
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:13.160]  by making it impossible for businesses to do business with the iranian bank
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:19.320]  who clears the deals to sell oil and so already we've just heard from
[01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:24.120]  japan they said according to the reports that they're going to cut back on
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.400]  buying iranian oil uh timothy geithner just went to china
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:32.840]  and tried to strung on the chinese into
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:38.440]  not buying iranian oil 22 percent of iranian oil goes to china
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.280]  the european economic union the eurozone
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.880]  they have already announced that they're going to stop buying
[01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:52.200]  iranian oil it's an act of war it's a reverse of what happened as they're
[01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:55.720]  talking about what uh... pearl harbor
[01:12:55.720 --> 01:12:58.920]  i mean people if they know their history a little bit
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:02.920]  the united states stopped japan from buying oil
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.280]  and now what they're doing is they're stopping iran
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.600]  from selling their oil and over 60 percent
[01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:18.040]  of iran's gdp comes from selling oil so we can see what's being set up here
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:24.680]  imagine this imagine if iran puts sanctions on companies
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:34.840]  doing business with america oh my god would there be some outrage going on
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:39.880]  no i did um i did notice that all of this is unfolding
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.720]  uh in fact while you were talking uh rob do just walked in
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:47.240]  and handed this to me while it's why i was distracted for a moment it's on
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:51.880]  another issue uh jerald but uh it ties in to just the rampant
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:56.840]  criminality here is a story out of royers mf global may not be able to pay
[01:13:56.840 --> 01:14:00.920]  clients back the trustee says jerald and so here we are
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:04.600]  two three months into this uh two and a half months into this and now they're
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:07.880]  just saying you know we don't know where the money is most of you won't get your
[01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:11.560]  money back and uh by the way uh
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.880]  core sign that the white house advisor got caught lying in congress but nobody
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:20.600]  gets in trouble i mean doesn't that just green light all sorts of new crime
[01:14:20.600 --> 01:14:24.200]  well exactly it's it's just it's a criminal operation
[01:14:24.200 --> 01:14:27.400]  and it's core sign i love the headline he's looking for new
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:31.960]  for for new place to start up business yeah how about sing sing
[01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:35.800]  again you know when you look at the prostitutes and how they cover this
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:39.400]  imagine if you were i or anybody listening
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:45.160]  breaks up a minor crime you know they'll crash down your doors and drag you away
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:49.320]  could you imagine not being able to find money on your tax return
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:55.080]  how they be hounding you to death and and going back and talking about this
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:59.640]  criminality and tying it together here's what's going on as i said in
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.560]  europe because what as we we made this forecast
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:09.160]  based upon as you mentioned a year ago the collapse coming the cover up it's
[01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:14.200]  not a recovery we said it was a cover up and if you look back and you hear the
[01:15:14.200 --> 01:15:17.320]  the european central banker at the time the head
[01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.320]  trichet a couple of years ago saying that the greek problem was
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.920]  solved they would handle it and now of course
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:27.880]  he i mean that you can't make this stuff up alex
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:34.840]  this is yesterday's financial times here's the headline
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:43.160]  ecb sees sees signs of lead up in debt crisis this is yesterday
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:47.320]  today guess what we have a debt crisis again
[01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:50.760]  and here's what they're saying over there in
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:54.520]  in uh in greece this is from the australian
[01:15:54.520 --> 01:16:01.640]  banks say no deal on greek debt quote there has been no agreement on any
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:06.680]  greek deal or a specific haircut says jaw
[01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:13.960]  charles dollara head of the institute of international finance which represents
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:19.800]  banks in the eu negotiation we remain open to a dialogue
[01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:25.320]  in search of a voluntary agreement now let's make this clear so everyone
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:31.480]  could understand this bs language the banks made bad bets
[01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:36.360]  it's as simple as that because they made bad bets
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:41.560]  they don't want to take a haircut you make a bad bet
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:45.240]  hey you know we'll call that alex capitalism
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.480]  how about that oh but not when the banks do it
[01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:55.480]  they don't want to take a haircut because the white shoe boys don't want to
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:59.160]  take a trimming instead they're gonna screw you
[01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:02.920]  and grab the money from you from the greeks
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:06.440]  from the italians from the americans from the french from the german
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.720]  from everybody so what do they do i got it
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:13.640]  austerity measures how's that for a nice word
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:19.080]  it kind of conjures up those feelings of you know doing the right thing yeah like
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:24.040]  raising taxes cutting benefits cutting pensions
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:27.960]  cutting services and increasing the cost of services
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:32.760]  raising taxes as you're losing money and increasing the retirement age
[01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:37.400]  until after you're dead so now what is happening is
[01:17:37.400 --> 01:17:41.480]  the whole system is collapsing they are now
[01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:45.240]  we're hearing reports that are coming out today as you know
[01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:50.920]  that they're going to be downgrading french and austrian debt just like they
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:54.280]  did in the us what does that mean the credit
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:58.040]  rating is being low so the very bankers that engineered all this who
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.240]  who are the recipients of our bailout that's our tax money
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:05.080]  they then lower your government's credit rating and you pay them higher
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:09.160]  interest on the money you gave them that they loaned back to you
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:13.880]  exactly and that's why they call them the money
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:19.080]  changers the loan sharks again the people that
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:22.920]  jesus christ beat out of the temple with a whip
[01:18:22.920 --> 01:18:28.920]  and turned over their tables the money changes are in charge
[01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:36.360]  like a slime ball like cause line and it keeps going on i'm sure alex
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:40.120]  that you read the latest reports that just came out

[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:03.560]  now going back to gerald salente gerald i've been throwing some of the questions
[01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:06.760]  out here and you were getting into afghanistan and these diversions but i
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:11.720]  totally concur with you they'll have this weird moral idea of torture
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:16.360]  secret arrest kill 200 people to kill one bad guy
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.080]  let 40 000 blacks be killed or injured because they're black and libya by
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:26.040]  western funded al qaeda all of this comes out and it's moral and loving
[01:35:26.040 --> 01:35:30.680]  with left cover under obama but then some troops
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:34.360]  urinate on dead bodies and i'm not saying that's a good thing to do but that's
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.800]  just clap i mean usually wars raping murder stuff even worse
[01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:41.240]  and then they obsess over it and moralize
[01:35:41.240 --> 01:35:45.240]  like they're these goody two shoes uh up there
[01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:50.040]  i mean it's clearly a psychological operation
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:56.200]  well again it it's exactly that because the same metaphor could be applied
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.000]  to you have a big guy like john
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:08.200]  the slime cause line that can't find 1.2 billion dollars
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:12.840]  and you see him at these phony little house hearings over there
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:16.920]  with the name in front of them honorable john cause line
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.240]  but then somebody you know you or i or anybody out there
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.960]  we have a minor infraction we're gonna come down with the strong arm of the
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:32.280]  lord to show us that we have to obey so these soldiers are the pawns
[01:36:32.280 --> 01:36:35.640]  for these criminals that sent them over there
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.640]  it's a despicable act to have invaded afghanistan
[01:36:39.640 --> 01:36:43.640]  it's a despicable act to have started the war in iraq
[01:36:43.640 --> 01:36:48.840]  how come there's no war crime tribunals it's clear as can be i saw that ron
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:54.200]  paul uh it's going all over the internet the one on the war
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:59.320]  in iraq we hear from colin powell how you hear from bush
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:02.840]  how you hear from rumsfeld how you hear from
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:07.240]  cheney say that's clay there all the evidence is there man
[01:37:07.240 --> 01:37:10.520]  this guy has weapons of mass destruction
[01:37:10.520 --> 01:37:15.240]  dear some of the worst on earth and they're gonna get us
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:18.280]  how come nobody's bringing them in for questioning
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:22.440]  it's the same thing the criminals that started
[01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:28.120]  are the ones that blame us for the problems because it all ties together
[01:37:28.120 --> 01:37:31.880]  alex what's going on in europe with the
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:36.760]  collapse of the european monetary union that's happening in front of us
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:40.760]  what they do and the same thing back here in the states
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:49.000]  the bigger their screw-ups the more it costs the more they clamp down on us
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:53.160]  so that's what you're seeing at every level whether it's at war
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:56.680]  whether it's in the economy whether it's in socialism
[01:37:56.680 --> 01:38:00.120]  as ron paul again says when they call him a racist
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:05.320]  he's out there saying you don't see any rich people getting electrocuted
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:08.840]  you don't see the rich people like john
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:15.160]  the slime cause i'm doing anytime it's the minorities
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:20.840]  it's the poorer people that it's one after another that it's all ties
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:26.280]  together well gerald i want to go to calls
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.560]  here but what are some of the other big trends you're looking at right now
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:34.280]  right now you know those are the ones that we all have to pay attention to
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:38.040]  and of course there's this whole election that's going on
[01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:41.880]  and the disgrace that they call the media
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.000]  you know i've i suffered for watching this stuff
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:50.360]  as you do and you see how they marginalize ron paul
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.960]  and one of i have to tell you you know i you know
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:39:00.760]  all my life i've been watching this i've never heard a greater speech than his
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:05.800]  after the new hampshire primary it was natural it was real we're sitting
[01:39:05.800 --> 01:39:10.440]  together with our staff and as soon as rami came on i looked at them i said
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:15.160]  this cat's talking from a teleprompter you see the way the cameras were set
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:18.760]  and his cadence and sure enough that's what it was
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:23.880]  and one after another they were dead ron paul hits it he was alive
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.080]  and one thing he said among other things
[01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:33.160]  that really stuck out he's calling for an intellectual revolution
[01:39:33.160 --> 01:39:38.040]  sound familiar it's a call that i made a number of years ago
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:42.360]  we sent out a trend alert and wrote about it in 2009
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:49.640]  we even took out the domain name intellectual revolution dot com
[01:39:49.640 --> 01:39:56.040]  back in 2009 so this is the direction for the future
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:03.080]  it has to be one of brains and clearly the nitwits at the treasury
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.480]  they don't have the brains i just want to read this to you briefly alex
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.800]  because it puts things in puts things into perspective
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.120]  of how we're being brainwashed and this is from of course
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:23.160]  the terlit paper of record the transcripts of the 2006 meetings
[01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:29.000]  clearly show some of the nation's preeminent economic minds
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.680]  did not fully understand the economy
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:39.000]  that they were in charge of supervising the most preeminent minds
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:43.240]  what a bunch of beltway
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:46.920]  wankers well no that's what they do they they have this appeal to experts and
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:51.560]  they roll out paid hacks and they'll say is it credible
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:54.360]  that ron paul i saw this on the news last week
[01:40:54.360 --> 01:40:59.080]  says that israel created hamas and they and the lady says no it's not credible
[01:40:59.080 --> 01:41:01.640]  when israel admits that they did it's like saying
[01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:05.240]  is it credible ron paul said that ducks have beaks
[01:41:05.240 --> 01:41:08.760]  and she goes no everyone knows they have the mouths of
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:13.800]  wolves and they're like see is it credible that ron paul says the sky is blue
[01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:18.680]  and she's like no and it's this where they sit there like con artist
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:23.720]  in plain view and tell us what reality is since you mentioned it jerald
[01:41:23.720 --> 01:41:26.680]  the whole things up at info wars dot com want to play part of it
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:31.800]  new ron paul ad war propaganda that we posted on info wars yesterday
[01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:35.640]  here it is
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:40.040]  we're going to find out massive evidence of weapons of mass destruction
[01:41:40.040 --> 01:41:43.720]  massive evidence of weapons of mass destruction all those things that you
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:47.400]  predict are going to come true and a lot of people that have been laying out
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:51.160]  the case against us are going to be very embarrassed intelligence gathered by this
[01:41:51.160 --> 01:41:54.680]  and other governments leaves no doubt that the iraq regime
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:42:00.200]  continues to possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons ever devised
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:03.960]  rap provided training in these weapons to al qaeda
[01:42:03.960 --> 01:42:08.440]  listen these folks are determined these are killers they chop people's heads off
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.680]  they're getting money from around the world they're getting recruits
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:18.680]  it turned out as we discovered later that a lot of the sourcing that had been
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:23.160]  attested to by the intelligence community was wrong i deeply regret
[01:42:23.160 --> 01:42:26.760]  that the information i presented with the multi-source was wrong
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:30.040]  i thought he had weapons of mass destruction it turns out he didn't those
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:32.280]  weapons of mass destruction got to be somewhere
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:35.960]  18 people were killed in iraq nope no weapons over there
[01:42:35.960 --> 01:42:40.600]  as many as four people are dead and 15 wounded after a car bomb exploded on
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:44.280]  tuesday maybe under here would be embarrassed in light of the fact that
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:46.920]  we did not find the weapons of mass destruction
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.200]  would you do the same thing all over again would you do the same thing all
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:55.320]  over again we rested our case on the existence of weapons of mass destruction
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:58.520]  i think without that weapons of mass destruction case
[01:42:58.520 --> 01:43:02.680]  the justification would not have been there it has nothing to do
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:07.880]  with national security matter of fact our national security is more
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:12.040]  jeopardized by permitting this to happen because
[01:43:12.040 --> 01:43:15.400]  we're allowed to start a war we're allowed to have
[01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:19.400]  our military men killed we're allowed to have
[01:43:19.400 --> 01:43:24.120]  more attacks on us by terrorists i do not think it's effective i think it
[01:43:24.120 --> 01:43:27.400]  drums up more anti-american hostility i see
[01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:33.400]  no threat to our national security there's no convincing evidence that iraq is
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.400]  capable of threatening the security of this country
[01:43:37.400 --> 01:43:41.640]  very little reason if any to pursue a war
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:44.920]  the iranians have repeatedly said they want to wipe israel off the map
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:47.800]  take military action to keep iran from having a nuclear weapon
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.720]  you have to take whatever steps are necessary whatever steps are necessary
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:54.840]  to break its capacity to have a nuclear weapon the iranians
[01:43:54.840 --> 01:43:58.360]  are are the existential threat to the state of israel
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:03.400]  how to shadow of a doubt leaves no doubt iran will take a nuclear weapon
[01:44:03.400 --> 01:44:09.160]  they will use it to wipe our ally israel off the face of the map
[01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:13.080]  it's another iraq coming is war propaganda going on
[01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:17.080]  to me the greatest danger is that we will have a president that will overreact
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.640]  Washington's enemy is an enemy that doesn't exist
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:24.200]  this wild gold to have another war in the name of defense
[01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:28.360]  is the dangerous thing but there is nothing that indicates
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:32.840]  that iran is really building a bomb they produced information that led you to
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:37.000]  believe that that they have no evidence we might not be able to trust the iaea
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:40.600]  they say that the source is actually a single source of the sourcing
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:44.520]  was wrong will not tell us where that source is coming from at all the
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.800]  providence providence of that source has not been established
[01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:51.800]  just like we did iraq build up the war propaganda there was no al-qaeda
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:56.680]  in iraq it's time we quit this all right
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:45:00.920]  and the real al-qaeda has been given libya uh
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:04.440]  gerald i played that clip because you you brought it up but i mean how do they
[01:45:04.440 --> 01:45:08.600]  square we've got to attack anybody who might get a nuke let's say they might
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:12.200]  get a nuke i mean do we attack pakistan russia china
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:16.920]  this idea that we attack somebody before they attack
[01:45:16.920 --> 01:45:20.280]  and then and then our government blows up their military bases as they admit
[01:45:20.280 --> 01:45:22.920]  is happening and that's loving and liberal to
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.440]  assassinate people and then torturing people is good
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:29.800]  and then the american people that go along with the war gerald do they think
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:34.280]  they're going to be safe uh when there's no bill of rights or constitution
[01:45:34.280 --> 01:45:37.480]  i mean these protections are there for a reason
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:42.120]  well again that's why one of the reasons we have one of our top trends
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:49.000]  of 2012 that'll field america how is you will know that after signing the
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:54.280]  national defense authorization act in on new year's eve when no one was paying
[01:45:54.280 --> 01:45:58.680]  attention and most people don't knowing what's going what is in that
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:02.520]  they could call the term is in there belligerence you and i we're pretty
[01:46:02.520 --> 01:46:05.720]  belligerent they could take us away and kill us
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.960]  and i believe they're doing this because they do see the collapse coming
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:13.640]  and they are going to start a war they're already doing
[01:46:13.640 --> 01:46:16.920]  they've declared war they're cutting them out from not making a
[01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:20.920]  buck it's an embargo it's it's clear as that
[01:46:20.920 --> 01:46:26.120]  and the point that i want to keep making is that the same type of incompetence
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:30.360]  that is in clear view for everyone to read
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:34.120]  that comes from the economic end the incompetence
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:40.360]  and stupidity and arrogance that we just heard from bush from cullen powell
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:45.320]  from rumsfeld i love rumsfeld they they chop people's heads off
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:51.000]  hey guess what i think somebody chopped your kahuna his off donald i'm sick and
[01:46:51.000 --> 01:46:54.280]  tired of these fat mouths like gingrich over there
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:58.200]  we have to go bar mo what you mean what do you mean we
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:02.200]  i mean this guy can't run up a flight of stairs what do you mean we
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:07.480]  and here's the sickness and the immorality because they're sending young guys to do
[01:47:07.480 --> 01:47:11.320]  this these guys are coming back realizing that they're
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:14.520]  going through all these tours of duty for nothing
[01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:18.920]  and being and being put in these terrible conditions
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:23.640]  and their lives threatened they're drugged out on prescription drugs
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:27.880]  they're coming back home and what's here for them
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:31.240]  nothing nothing i read something that the
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:34.680]  unemployment rate among our vets is over 30 percent
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:38.200]  and they don't want to go to the va and you know why they don't want to go to the
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:42.360]  va because they just saw how the military
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:47.880]  shafted them and they don't trust the va so it's you know it's a morality issue
[01:47:47.880 --> 01:47:51.080]  here it's as clear as that now we've got a bunch of
[01:47:51.080 --> 01:47:54.600]  crooks that are cynical i think everything's a joke i think the party's
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.600]  going to never end i want to go to some calls but
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:59.880]  look at this economic news now you and i and others get criticized for pointing
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:04.680]  out that according to all classical economic numbers we're in a depression
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:09.400]  us debtneers 15.94 trillion that's more than the gdp
[01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:14.200]  every year here's one out of fours the worst economic recovery
[01:48:14.200 --> 01:48:17.560]  since the great depression now they call it the greatest recession you got to
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:23.560]  love how they spin 50 million americans on electronic soup kitchen food stamps
[01:48:23.560 --> 01:48:26.840]  and they just keep shoveling this bull at us
[01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:30.920]  and and and it's become totally see-through but they're up there saying
[01:48:30.920 --> 01:48:33.880]  let them eat cake i don't see them getting away with this
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:38.520]  Gerald well no and again this this election is the most
[01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:44.200]  important in our lifetime it's it can go alex i've never felt
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.720]  more confident about a new year than 2012
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.680]  the vacuum is so huge anyone can see through the lies
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:56.600]  again front page story about how the fed
[01:48:56.600 --> 01:49:00.600]  didn't see it coming and lied to us simultaneously
[01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:05.720]  the clip that you just played of ron paul how they lied to us
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:11.640]  people see it you're 100 correct the future is in our hands
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:16.600]  it's a moral issue it's not a political issue
[01:49:16.600 --> 01:49:20.440]  a lot of the criminality that we have in our government flows all these problems
[01:49:20.440 --> 01:49:23.720]  i mean it's now coming out the monsanto we already knew this but now it's
[01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:29.400]  confirmed actually owns most of the um ambassadors
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:33.560]  and pays them and so they'll give a country some giant concession that
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:37.640]  hurts other industries just to get what monsanto wants through
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:42.520]  i mean there's just no end to this espionage this is corporate globalist
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:45.000]  espionage through our government look at how
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:48.280]  Goldman Sachs runs all the country ministers
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:52.520]  that they're gutting i mean it's real simple it's a hijacking
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.960]  again as i said it you know it's as old as the scriptures
[01:49:55.960 --> 01:50:00.680]  the money changes are in charge it's the love of money being the root of all
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:03.880]  evil i just didn't make that one up right now
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:08.360]  and you can look at it the ties are the same look at the war profits here to
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:11.240]  miss iraq war oh they'll come up they can't point
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:14.440]  85 billion dollars and i hate what's for lunch
[01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:18.600]  i mean come on it's one thing after another and again as i said we have a
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:22.840]  gang of 535 senators and congressmen running the show
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:26.760]  but now i see videos every day where a woman
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:30.920]  just says oh you're a big tough guy to a cop so he punches her in the face and
[01:50:30.920 --> 01:50:34.440]  the police chief defends it or where they beat somebody up for
[01:50:34.440 --> 01:50:37.960]  filming them i mean they throw the book at you for not even having a crooked
[01:50:37.960 --> 01:50:40.760]  toenail if you don't suck their boots properly
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:44.760]  i mean but then meanwhile the criminals are running rampant you got it
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.080]  and that's what happens in third world countries
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:52.920]  look again the gap between the rich and the poor
[01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:59.800]  when i began my career in the in 1970 my first real job
[01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:06.200]  the gap between the ceo and the average worker was 24 to 1
[01:51:06.200 --> 01:51:13.080]  now it's about 450 to 1 you look at today yesterday's news how much these
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:18.120]  three guys in the carlile group you know it's politically
[01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:24.520]  tied hedge fund private equity firm like a hundred million each or something
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:27.800]  and then you see the tax rate that they pay
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:32.200]  they pay they don't they don't pay it on a personal level no no it's a capital
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:35.000]  games tax no it's not you're just doing deals
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:38.920]  you're paying 15 percent we have to pay much more
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:43.480]  we're in the 35 percent range the whole game is rigged
[01:51:43.480 --> 01:51:49.000]  by the money changers it's as simple as that but i want to make it clear
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:53.880]  because you brought it up people are seeing through this
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:52:01.160]  the future is in our hands it's hours to have and i have to say
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:07.320]  i have never been so pro a candidate as i am and i make this clear i don't agree
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:10.120]  with ron paul on a lot of libertarian issues
[01:52:10.120 --> 01:52:14.040]  i want the cftc the commodities future trading commission
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:19.160]  i want the scc the point is he is an outsider the system is attacking him
[01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:22.440]  and that right there lets you know that's why he's the man for the job and look at
[01:52:22.440 --> 01:52:25.560]  how they're throwing everything they've got at him
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:29.560]  and he would be the candidate presumptive winner
[01:52:29.560 --> 01:52:32.360]  for the nomination if they weren't throwing everything they had at him but
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:36.200]  despite that he's still rising and they are pulling
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:39.640]  their hair out they relish the prostitutes to
[01:52:39.640 --> 01:52:42.840]  the the coin you termed the term you coined
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:46.440]  that that they can't just tell us what reality is now
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:50.440]  we don't just fold down on our knees and worship these little chicken neck
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:54.520]  teleprompter readers when they lied to us i want to go to some calls here but
[01:52:54.520 --> 01:52:58.520]  um make a comment on the prostitutes running out of bullets and
[01:52:58.520 --> 01:53:02.120]  just discrediting themselves in the process oh yeah i mean you see it all
[01:53:02.120 --> 01:53:05.880]  the time was this guy this guy king was a john king queen
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:09.240]  and his wife donna bash it's on the video her him
[01:53:09.240 --> 01:53:13.560]  her saying how worried she was in the republicans is a cnn
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:17.880]  that if ron paul wins you know if he keeps going and the and the other issue
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:21.480]  here and i want to make this really clear
[01:53:21.480 --> 01:53:28.360]  four more years of obama people are going to wish that bush was back
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:33.400]  unbelievable let's go to bryan in north carolina and then we'll go to jeff and
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:37.880]  alarick and everybody else bryan are on the air uh hey gerald and alex they
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:41.080]  got a quick question for the both of you okay
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:46.920]  uh what do you think about ewin corporations youtube worldwide blockade
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:52.120]  of not just your 2000s sub-documentary in game blueprint for global enslavement
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:55.320]  but they could censor the obama deception
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:54:00.600]  which you and gerald splinty were both on oh yeah i mean there's big calls for
[01:54:00.600 --> 01:54:05.560]  internet censorship going on oh yeah that's one of our top trends big
[01:54:05.560 --> 01:54:09.000]  brother internet oh no look ticket i'm telling you the
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:13.080]  bigger their screw ups the harder they clamp down on us
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:17.080]  you know what we're going to see maybe you know a wheelchair granny bomber
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:20.200]  a brazil bomber they're going to make something up where they're going to
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:25.160]  start a war and it'll be an excuse to clamp down more on our freedoms
[01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:30.120]  how much more clamp down than you need than the national defense authorization
[01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:35.320]  act well said thank you so much bryan good good
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:40.280]  questions anything else uh i said to your news
[01:54:40.280 --> 01:54:45.640]  tip emails so you can look at all the screenshots of the censorship going on
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:49.160]  all right we'll look it up thank you uh let's go to alaric in nebraska and then
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:53.240]  jeff alaric here on the air go ahead yeah i'm really
[01:54:53.240 --> 01:54:58.440]  glad you guys talked about the uh censorship of ron paul here's a
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:02.840]  couple of little news items i got four small things one is virginia they
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:07.480]  apparently closed their primary so that uh now you have to be registered um
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:11.640]  also the a judge has backtracked and said that the other candidates not just
[01:55:11.640 --> 01:55:16.760]  romney and ron paul will be allowed on it but all of the other ones as well
[01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:20.360]  yeah yeah ron paul goes out and actually qualifies for all the states
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:24.440]  the others don't need to now that way they can try to sap his vote i did see
[01:55:24.440 --> 01:55:27.720]  that and they've got people all over every channel saying he cannot win he
[01:55:27.720 --> 01:55:31.640]  will not win talking down to their viewers
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:35.400]  i know this is totally disgusting with this guy oh donal one of these guys
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:39.160]  called him a fraud this guy shouts babbling on
[01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:44.040]  every one of them yeah he said huntsman really won this is on msnbc the host
[01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:49.000]  huntsman really won ron paul and his supporters are frauds
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:52.760]  yeah i mean you know how this is disgusting
[01:55:52.760 --> 01:55:56.680]  these guys think they you talk about the white shoe boy arrogance they really
[01:55:56.680 --> 01:55:59.720]  are arrogant they're so used to telling us
[01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:03.240]  to get down and lick their boots and get down and do what they say they really
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:06.440]  think they control us but you can see them losing
[01:56:06.440 --> 01:56:09.560]  i mean they're losing more and more every day jerald
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:14.360]  well i know look uh it's it's evident as can be
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:17.240]  who are these people to say what we should think
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.240]  or who could win i mean the arrogance is
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:25.240]  they think we're so weak minded and so peer pressure driven
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:29.880]  that they tell us how to dress how to talk like like your dad used to tell you
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:33.560]  don't be a parrot don't repeat be your own person that's what freedom is all
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:36.440]  about and when some guys in a suit with a perfect
[01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:40.360]  teleprompter saying ron paul and his supporters are a fraud
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.920]  no that person's a fraud and he's a panicked fraud and they're so arrogant
[01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:49.160]  they're so hubris filled jerald that i know is what's going to undo them
[01:56:49.160 --> 01:56:54.040]  because they just can't even hide what arrogant scumbags they are
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:57.960]  yeah exactly and and again the future is
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:03.160]  hours to have you look at the a number of young people
[01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:07.240]  that are supporting ron paul and there was a thing i
[01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:10.840]  can't stand the huffington post there was something in there yesterday
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:15.880]  about this woman writing about how the young people are supporting ron paul
[01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:19.640]  in one illiterate sentence one illiterate long sentence
[01:57:19.640 --> 01:57:24.680]  she managed to knock him down three times calling him crotchety
[01:57:24.680 --> 01:57:31.000]  saying that he has to take a nap or we can't go on because he has to take a
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:36.520]  rest i mean one a great grandfather one derogatory thing
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:40.920]  after another and then finally saying that young people support him
[01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:45.320]  so the it's the youth it's the youth that can get us through this
[01:57:45.320 --> 01:57:49.640]  i love the fact that ron paul points out when loser draw we win this is about an
[01:57:49.640 --> 01:57:53.560]  idea and those are bulletproof allaric anything else
[01:57:53.560 --> 01:57:57.720]  uh yeah florida looks like they're gonna allow a proportional
[01:57:57.720 --> 01:58:01.720]  delegates so that if that is true then ron paul may stand to chance to get
[01:58:01.720 --> 01:58:06.440]  delegates from florida yeah it does and again you know
[01:58:06.440 --> 01:58:11.240]  let's understand as you just pointed out the game is rigged
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:15.720]  they rig it whether it's finance whether it's politics

[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:48.840]  now just a couple of months ago there was a report that came out about the
[02:00:48.840 --> 02:00:54.360]  last elections in all in ohio and how those numbers or election before how
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.440]  the numbers are all cooked and what do we have that company die bold

[02:01:55.400 --> 02:02:01.640]  and then he said maybe shorter the only way these guys could get away with this
[02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:06.360]  crap is by having the presidential reality show
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:11.640]  stage set for them and a bunch of suck-up bowed-down

[02:09:07.400 --> 02:09:11.400]  a depression but they won't call it that and we've also got x israeli
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:15.000]  intelligence officer tells the jewsland post that the u.s will stage a pearl
[02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:18.760]  harbor attack against its own shifts as a pretext for all out

[02:09:34.600 --> 02:09:41.800]  but coming up i have a clip from v from vendetta that i want to play
[02:09:41.800 --> 02:09:45.720]  where they talk about government staging a false flag bio attack
[02:09:45.720 --> 02:09:48.520]  which i believe is in the cards and i've been saying this of course before
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:52.680]  that movie uh came out i mean it's very clear you have the new york times on
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:56.920]  monday with the headline engineered doomsday we're all over the country
[02:09:56.920 --> 02:10:02.040]  the u.s government funds in level two labs what should be in level four labs if
[02:10:02.040 --> 02:10:08.120]  anywhere weaponized abola bird flu h1n1
[02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:13.160]  mouse pox some of these kill 99 of all humans they come in contact with
[02:10:13.160 --> 02:10:21.080]  enter airborne so i want to play this clip that clip coming up with bob
[02:10:21.080 --> 02:10:24.760]  but first i wanted to play and then get bob Chapman's take on this
[02:10:24.760 --> 02:10:28.520]  because you know he grew up and saw all of this the andy
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:33.800]  griffith show from the 1950s that aired into the 1960s
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:39.800]  with all of its wholesome pro america constitution bill of rights messages
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:44.280]  and then compare this now where everything is an assault on the family
[02:10:44.280 --> 02:10:47.800]  everything is how to teach your two-year-old profanity the f word during
[02:10:47.800 --> 02:10:51.960]  the family hour uttered by the baby i saw that this week it's like
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:56.760]  baby to utter the f word on network tv just all about
[02:10:56.760 --> 02:11:00.360]  making everything petty and arrested development and adults acting like
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:03.880]  children i mean imagine if in 50 years tv has
[02:11:03.880 --> 02:11:07.960]  turned into what it is now what will it be like in 20 years
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:11.320]  why is there this total assault on morality
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:14.680]  because if you stand for nothing you'll fall for anything
[02:11:14.680 --> 02:11:18.600]  that's why i want to play this this clip now this is where
[02:11:18.600 --> 02:11:24.280]  um the sheriff uh his son's not doing well on some history and he says it's
[02:11:24.280 --> 02:11:27.640]  okay opi i wasn't too good at history don't worry about it
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:31.000]  so he goes to the teacher and says i'm not gonna worry about it my dad says
[02:11:31.000 --> 02:11:34.920]  don't worry about it so she threatens to quit the kids run into the
[02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:37.560]  police station night if you go through a naked body scanner
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:40.840]  and you know because you're a terrorist and they talk to the sheriff and say
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:47.160]  you know gee uh you know this is great she you know she doesn't uh
[02:11:47.160 --> 02:11:50.760]  you'll think she can teach us anymore we're winning and he gives them a little
[02:11:50.760 --> 02:11:53.640]  history lesson and tells them how informative and
[02:11:53.640 --> 02:11:57.880]  interesting history is and they basically wake up to how

[02:14:28.040 --> 02:14:31.960]  and we weren't getting along with them too good in fact we was thinking about
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:36.120]  breaking away and starting our own country but the king over there in
[02:14:36.120 --> 02:14:39.960]  england he says you do that and i'm going to send
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:43.880]  my red coats they was british soldiers and he's

[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:52.520]  he says you better think about that thing
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:56.840]  well so you great great great great great great granddad is all got together
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:15:00.600]  you know to think about it and they argued about it back and forth a while
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:04.520]  and finally one of them says let's do it let's start our own country
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:08.600]  somebody says how you do that says i don't know says i read you just started
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:13.320]  says uh what do we call it says let's call it let's call it the united states of
[02:15:13.320 --> 02:15:18.120]  america that was a good name yeah about that time
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:22.760]  up in boston massachusetts there's a fella living up there named paul revere
[02:15:22.760 --> 02:15:25.880]  and he's a pretty good old fella just as poor as joe's turkey but he is a pretty
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:29.720]  good old fella and he owned a real good old horse named nally
[02:15:29.720 --> 02:15:33.080]  and paul he is wandering around the streets up there one night and he come up
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:36.440]  on the friend of his and he says hi what's new

[02:15:40.760 --> 02:15:43.560]  the matter with thee and paul says you're kidding
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:47.400]  he says it's a fact says i just heard it from an indian and you know them indians
[02:15:47.400 --> 02:15:51.560]  they keep their ears to the ground and paul says that the folks know about this
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:55.480]  fella says i just heard about it myself and paul says well what we're gonna do
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:15:59.320]  and fella says i'm getting out of town and paul says well we got to spread the
[02:15:59.320 --> 02:16:02.440]  word he says you spread it i'm getting out of town
[02:16:02.440 --> 02:16:07.880]  well paul he didn't know what to do but he know he had to do something
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:10.920]  now it happened it happened that they had planned
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:15.080]  if the british was ever to come over here that they had put a light up in this
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:20.360]  high church steeple and paul went down there to look and sure enough
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:25.960]  there was the light burning brighter than day well paul he jumped on his old horse
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:29.640]  and he let out he didn't know where he was going but he knew he had to go
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:31.800]  somewhere oh i wish you could have seen it
[02:16:31.800 --> 02:16:35.240]  that old horse with his ears laid back in his nostrils wide open
[02:16:35.240 --> 02:16:39.160]  sucking in wind like a jet engine feet pounding on them cobblestones
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:42.280]  striking off sparks paul are holding on for dear life
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:46.040]  and are hollering at the top of his lungs he says the british is coming the
[02:16:46.040 --> 02:16:50.360]  british is coming get you a gun we're gonna have us a revolution
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:53.240]  and them farmers come up piling out of the hay like
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:56.520]  be out of beehive minute men there's called
[02:16:56.520 --> 02:16:59.560]  they grabbed their squirrel guns what's meant me
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:03.080]  minute men there's fellas that had to be ready at a minute's notice
[02:17:03.080 --> 02:17:06.840]  and when paul comes screeching down the road that way they grabbed their guns
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:11.480]  and hid out behind the weeds and walls and trees and everywhere
[02:17:11.480 --> 02:17:16.360]  and when the british come prancing long haul dressed up and in their red suits
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:20.680]  and waving to the girls they let them have it
[02:17:20.680 --> 02:17:25.320]  it was a sight to see and then it happened
[02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:28.920]  they fired the gun they fired the gun
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:34.840]  and the shop was so loud it was heard clear around the world
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:41.880]  oh get out that's the way this country started
[02:17:42.680 --> 02:17:45.400]  you read the book
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:52.040]  what book yeah what book
[02:17:52.040 --> 02:17:55.800]  where did you get that story paul paul
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:18:02.760]  your history book my history book sure all kinds of good stories stuck in
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:06.440]  there most history yeah good as what you just told us
[02:18:06.440 --> 02:18:10.920]  sure some of them even better no fooling paul no fooling
[02:18:10.920 --> 02:18:13.560]  you folks look through that book i bet you in a couple of weeks you'd be coming
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:17.960]  in here tell me stories all right now i wanted to play that i
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:20.280]  appreciate bob sitting while we did that we're about to go to break but i want
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:23.880]  to get his take on it to illustrate you wonder why americans
[02:18:23.880 --> 02:18:27.000]  don't know why they're being enslaved they were never taught it
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:31.800]  look at the messages in tv now it's it's all anti-liberty
[02:18:31.800 --> 02:18:37.400]  anti-family anti-gun look at what the globalists have done to us by design
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:42.280]  to steal our birthright bob shatman your take on that clip
[02:18:42.280 --> 02:18:45.400]  and the opposite of that is training us to be
[02:18:45.400 --> 02:18:49.480]  citizens of the world in a one-world government
[02:18:49.480 --> 02:18:57.480]  and it is pointed out earlier by yourself alex it's the difference between
[02:18:57.480 --> 02:19:03.320]  pro-americanism and morality we're lacking a lot of that morality
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:07.160]  today is as we know we see what goes on every day
[02:19:07.160 --> 02:19:10.280]  and so yes there's been a process of brainwashing
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:15.560]  and they'll try to continue it and we have to inform people and that's what
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:19.240]  we're doing about what these people are up to and that's what these programs
[02:19:19.240 --> 02:19:22.520]  are all about bob i'm glad you're here i want to

[02:24:34.280 --> 02:24:38.120]  let's go ahead and go back to bob Chapman uh bob
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:41.640]  as the united states continues to implode obviously the same global system
[02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:43.720]  is unfolding everywhere but from your research
[02:24:43.720 --> 02:24:47.720]  so i get these questions all the time where are some of the better places to
[02:24:47.720 --> 02:24:52.360]  move to or expatriate to in your opinion
[02:24:52.360 --> 02:24:57.080]  well europe's expensive even by u.s standards
[02:24:57.080 --> 02:25:02.120]  the weather is poor most of the year you might get one two months of summer and
[02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:07.240]  that's it. Canada is an opportunity i do see
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:12.520]  people immigrating away from Australia which really surprised me
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:17.560]  but people immigrating into new zealand in south
[02:25:17.560 --> 02:25:23.400]  central america and mexico there's been a tremendous amount of changes in the
[02:25:23.400 --> 02:25:26.280]  governments particularly in south america
[02:25:26.280 --> 02:25:29.960]  and most of them are communists with the exception of argentina
[02:25:29.960 --> 02:25:33.640]  which is a fascist government which now will only let you
[02:25:33.640 --> 02:25:39.320]  retire approximately two-thirds of your assets for the country you'd have
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:43.560]  to leave one third there which is not a very good idea if you wanted to leave
[02:25:43.560 --> 02:25:48.360]  and so what does that leave in south america it leaves chili
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:54.280]  perhaps columbia which is very close to the united states
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:57.400]  they work very closely with them they just put it that way
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:02.600]  a Panama is not bad uh Costa Rica is nice
[02:26:02.600 --> 02:26:09.560]  Nicaragua is another communist country uh Mexico uh you do along the frontier
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:16.760]  and in the south and also in the Culiacan
[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:21.640]  you have violence and that's because of the war that's been going on for five
[02:26:21.640 --> 02:26:26.040]  years between the government and the Nicaragua
[02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:32.280]  and so it's a mixed bag you got to pick out a spot where you think you'd
[02:26:32.280 --> 02:26:36.360]  like to go that's relatively safe some countries will
[02:26:36.360 --> 02:26:43.560]  make you allow you to work some won't it all depends on your profession
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:47.160]  that's basically it the the the best ones are
[02:26:47.160 --> 02:26:55.480]  probably Canada Australia Chile Costa Rica and Mexico
[02:26:55.480 --> 02:26:59.480]  but undoubtedly Australia and New Zealand are part of the whole globalist
[02:26:59.480 --> 02:27:04.360]  echelon group as i call them uh and and Canada you're kind of jumping out of
[02:27:04.360 --> 02:27:07.880]  the fire into the frying pan but i guess the united states is command
[02:27:07.880 --> 02:27:11.000]  based central of the global imperium's army
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.600]  and it's where there's going to be a big political fight between liberty lovers
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:17.880]  and the new world order but if you want to be where the fight's going to be
[02:27:17.880 --> 02:27:21.880]  both intellectually and perhaps physically this is ground zero uh do you
[02:27:21.880 --> 02:27:26.760]  agree with that analysis absolutely if you're young and healthy in
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:30.280]  particular and uh you have a family uh you're
[02:27:30.280 --> 02:27:32.840]  not going to be able to jump to another country and uh
[02:27:32.840 --> 02:27:36.520]  just go to work that'll allow that and so you're going to stay there and you're
[02:27:36.520 --> 02:27:39.480]  going to fight and people like me who have been forced
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:43.800]  out of the country as old as i am uh i'll be back
[02:27:43.800 --> 02:27:47.320]  that's right i mean they tried to plant hand grenades on you everything just
[02:27:47.320 --> 02:27:51.800]  went on for decades and you finally left um but uh
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:56.040]  how long you been out of the us bob uh this time
[02:27:56.040 --> 02:28:01.400]  nine years of course before that you lived all the world in business
[02:28:01.400 --> 02:28:06.280]  well yeah but i lived in i lived in so many countries they can't keep track of
[02:28:06.280 --> 02:28:09.800]  them all and i i lived there for a year or two or three
[02:28:09.800 --> 02:28:13.080]  i mean like in africa i was there for over three years
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:19.160]  and um canada i was there for a year uh the bahamas i was there for a year
[02:28:19.160 --> 02:28:26.280]  uh otagoi uh maybe two years and so on and so forth how was latin america
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:32.200]  than what it's like yeah how has latin america changed since she first visited
[02:28:32.200 --> 02:28:37.000]  it's become more americanized and uh
[02:28:37.000 --> 02:28:40.360]  the standard of living has really been raised
[02:28:40.360 --> 02:28:46.040]  big through all latin america and mexico that's a good thing
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:51.960]  they've come a long way this there's no giant reason for people uh to leave most
[02:28:51.960 --> 02:28:55.400]  of the countries in that region and go to america now because
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:28:59.480]  there there are lots of jobs mexico city is booming
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:06.040]  uh uh some of the countries are doing very well
[02:29:06.680 --> 02:29:10.840]  venezuela not so much though with the kami running it
[02:29:10.840 --> 02:29:14.520]  no but that's what you have to expect when you have communism
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:20.760]  and you've got it in ecuador peru bolivia uh as i mentioned nicaragua uh
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:24.920]  right on the edges brazil uh they're not fooling anybody
[02:29:24.920 --> 02:29:29.400]  and then you've got a uh a fascist government in
[02:29:29.400 --> 02:29:33.800]  uh argentina uh which is loaded with crime

[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:48.840]  bob you got interrupted by the end of that segment you were saying you saw a
[02:33:48.840 --> 02:33:53.080]  stick up uh repeat where you saw that and and where you see the most outrageous
[02:33:53.080 --> 02:33:57.800]  crime my dad was in perigway a few times a year he he goes to
[02:33:57.800 --> 02:34:01.480]  latin america in places you know most dentists and doctors get recruited for
[02:34:01.480 --> 02:34:05.160]  this and he goes and does clinics in the jungle and stuff with starving
[02:34:05.160 --> 02:34:08.120]  children he he says it'll really make you appreciate life
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:11.000]  you know going where you know they they they tell you don't give a child a
[02:34:11.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  balloon or anything because other kids people will kill them for it
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:18.040]  uh you know the jealousy is so out of control people dumping their kids
[02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:20.920]  everywhere but uh he was out in perigway for about a
[02:34:20.920 --> 02:34:26.360]  week and a half and working most days uh to you know long hours
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:29.320]  doing free dental work and other things at clinics
[02:34:29.320 --> 02:34:33.000]  and uh as part of a foundation that he went with
[02:34:33.000 --> 02:34:36.120]  and but but then one day they said we'll take off this afternoon we're going to
[02:34:36.120 --> 02:34:39.800]  take you to a national soccer game and my dad told me about this and i was at
[02:34:39.800 --> 02:34:43.000]  his house a month ago and i pulled it up on my iPhone there it was
[02:34:43.000 --> 02:34:46.680]  he just got back from perigway they threw up stick a dynamite down at the
[02:34:46.680 --> 02:34:50.920]  referee and blew him and one other person up almost killing both of them
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:55.320]  my dad was like 60 feet from this happening so talk about bedlam i know
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.960]  my uncle was in guatemala back in the 80s uh
[02:34:57.960 --> 02:35:00.920]  living down there with a coffee plantation he had and you know they
[02:35:00.920 --> 02:35:04.680]  talked about the hand grenades being thrown at the market on a routine basis
[02:35:04.680 --> 02:35:10.200]  so so finish your story well we were across the street uh about 60
[02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:13.960]  feet away and this man walks up to a couple
[02:35:13.960 --> 02:35:17.560]  and uh i see the man take his uh wallet out
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:21.400]  and hand it to the other guy the guy uh i could see his gun
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:25.960]  he stuck it in the gun back in his belt uh buttoned his jacket and just walked
[02:35:25.960 --> 02:35:29.960]  off there were no police around and inside the input there were no police
[02:35:29.960 --> 02:35:34.200]  either and they only pleased i saw them when you when you go through the
[02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:37.560]  uh them checking your baggage that sort of thing
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:43.640]  but there's streets there in Buenos Aires that you just can't go down
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:49.560]  during the daytime never mind at night and and that's if you're armed i mean
[02:35:49.560 --> 02:35:54.040]  if you're unarmed your goose is cooked and you gotta learn those things
[02:35:54.040 --> 02:35:58.920]  living there so that you don't happen to uh go down the wrong street and what's
[02:35:58.920 --> 02:36:03.720]  the prerequisite of all these nations they've never had a second amendment
[02:36:03.720 --> 02:36:07.240]  and so only the criminal government and the criminals are armed and it's a
[02:36:07.240 --> 02:36:11.400]  living hell well it varies from state to state
[02:36:11.400 --> 02:36:16.520]  you take mexico as an example um you're gonna go to the military
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:20.200]  uh sign up and purchase a gun from them
[02:36:20.200 --> 02:36:23.960]  and uh you can carry it with you you can have it in your house
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:27.880]  if you carry it with you you can't have the bullets in the gun
[02:36:27.880 --> 02:36:31.800]  so you buy an automatic it has to be lower in caliber
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:35.000]  than or the same as what the military's carrying
[02:36:35.000 --> 02:36:38.600]  and they carry a nine millimeter and so you can
[02:36:38.600 --> 02:36:43.960]  use a 357 and or something like that in an automatic
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:47.480]  um from what i've read though mexico has almost a complete gun man for the
[02:36:47.480 --> 02:36:50.920]  citizens uh i know there are hoops you can jump
[02:36:50.920 --> 02:36:55.000]  through to get a gun and you basically get registered with them but uh
[02:36:55.000 --> 02:36:59.480]  but it's easy it there's not hoops it's easy oh wow to do is go to the
[02:36:59.480 --> 02:37:04.200]  military and show them your voting card and your driver's license and who you
[02:37:04.200 --> 02:37:07.960]  are and uh you can buy a shotgun and a
[02:37:07.960 --> 02:37:10.840]  rifle but they can't be a caliber that's in
[02:37:10.840 --> 02:37:15.880]  excess of what military has that must be that must have changed
[02:37:15.880 --> 02:37:19.560]  recently then because of the badlam because from what i've read just in
[02:37:19.560 --> 02:37:22.760]  fact book stuff is that they pretty much have no second amendment but
[02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:27.960]  that's good news well i i i just happened to know that
[02:37:27.960 --> 02:37:31.960]  because uh i know somebody worked in the military uh
[02:37:31.960 --> 02:37:36.840]  and he was in the army and he handled that that's how i i know about it yeah
[02:37:36.840 --> 02:37:40.760]  well there's this claim combinations like Costa Rica you can have a gun
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:47.320]  i mean i i've been in and i live there uh for a long time uh i went in the
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:52.920]  market downtown in San Jose and i'm just going through it's like a
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:58.920]  piangis uh which is a um flea market and uh and
[02:37:58.920 --> 02:38:01.880]  there's one counter the others four or five guns for sale
[02:38:01.880 --> 02:38:05.320]  no registration no nothing
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:09.320]  well that's a big plus i know a lot of those countries though do restrict the
[02:38:09.320 --> 02:38:13.880]  citizens having guns that's right because usually
[02:38:13.880 --> 02:38:19.240]  they're quasi dictators and uh that's the mindset i mean even
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:23.240]  the legal elections they they have that uh the same
[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:31.560]  uh of you on uh the people as they do in london and uh and the washington
[02:38:31.560 --> 02:38:37.320]  now bob varies by degree bob i want to move now into the economy mf global
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:40.440]  may not be able to pay clients back but let's skip that it's already covered
[02:38:40.440 --> 02:38:45.080]  that with gel salante uh what do you make of uh
[02:38:45.080 --> 02:38:48.760]  the the credit ratings being dropped in other european countries
[02:38:48.760 --> 02:38:53.720]  the latest economic numbers uh we've got here in the united states
[02:38:53.720 --> 02:38:58.840]  well uh we've been waiting for France to be lowered
[02:38:58.840 --> 02:39:05.000]  and uh that affects the efsf which is a funding mechanism
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:09.240]  the esm which they're trying to get past which is another funding mechanism
[02:39:09.240 --> 02:39:13.320]  which will probably supersede the efsf and
[02:39:13.320 --> 02:39:16.680]  but what they did is they had the federal reserve
[02:39:16.680 --> 02:39:21.560]  uh do a swap and the swap is a technical thing
[02:39:21.560 --> 02:39:25.480]  where uh we'll give you a trillion dollars worth of dollars and you give us
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:30.760]  a trillion dollars worth of euros and everything goes down
[02:39:30.760 --> 02:39:37.480]  on uh a uh digital basis now the reason they did this and
[02:39:37.480 --> 02:39:43.480]  they actually broke the the law in the united states as well as in uh in europe
[02:39:43.480 --> 02:39:48.200]  because they're not supposed to do that because it's alone by any other name
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:52.600]  and so with that said uh in the fractional banking system
[02:39:52.600 --> 02:39:58.760]  the 523 banks that took that money down they can multiply that by
[02:39:58.760 --> 02:40:03.240]  nine or more if they choose so in essence what the fed did
[02:40:03.240 --> 02:40:06.520]  is not only give them a trillion dollars to play around with
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:11.560]  they really gave them 10 trillion or more and that's going to affect the us
[02:40:11.560 --> 02:40:16.280]  markets and the british markets as well because there are those who still don't
[02:40:16.280 --> 02:40:21.240]  trust the system in europe which is the euro and
[02:40:21.240 --> 02:40:25.880]  they've already started buying us treasures because they deem them
[02:40:25.880 --> 02:40:29.880]  safer than the euro at this time and so you get
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:33.560]  you're getting money moving from one place to the other so what does that
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:37.560]  mean to the united states it means that the economy
[02:40:37.560 --> 02:40:41.240]  will probably grow more in the united states this year
[02:40:41.240 --> 02:40:45.080]  than anybody had anticipated what are we talking about
[02:40:45.080 --> 02:40:48.920]  well i thought it would be minus one and a half percent in disaster
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:52.760]  with this money being let loose it's going to probably be a plus one and a
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:57.320]  half percent or two percent and that is going to be very
[02:40:57.320 --> 02:41:01.480]  surprising to people because they didn't figure on this
[02:41:01.480 --> 02:41:04.840]  and they didn't know about it i didn't know that we're going to do that
[02:41:04.840 --> 02:41:07.480]  yeah they have a lot of curveballs they can throw
[02:41:07.480 --> 02:41:11.320]  so let's think about curveballs obviously they can launch a war with iran
[02:41:11.320 --> 02:41:14.840]  for the election as an october surprise obama
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:18.280]  and all of his sheep-like followers and they can also
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:22.360]  do some other hanky-panky economically to jumpstart things for a while what
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:24.600]  else bob
[02:41:24.600 --> 02:41:28.520]  well i think uh... this uh...
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:32.120]  uh... business of the french being lowered
[02:41:32.120 --> 02:41:35.880]  uh... is only one of two they'll be lowered again this year
[02:41:35.880 --> 02:41:42.040]  uh... they did not uh... lower any of the uh... german banks
[02:41:42.040 --> 02:41:45.640]  nor ireland for that matter uh... and so
[02:41:45.640 --> 02:41:50.840]  uh... that's why they came out with this money exchange
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:54.680]  at this time because they knew that europe
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:58.520]  could not handle it and they're never going to be able to handle it
[02:41:58.520 --> 02:42:01.960]  and so this will in fact jamey diamond
[02:42:01.960 --> 02:42:06.520]  yesterday uh... who's the head of jp mogan chase
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:10.600]  said exactly the same thing i'm saying now and he said
[02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:14.440]  um... they'll take care of him for a year maybe a little longer
[02:42:14.440 --> 02:42:18.920]  i've been saying the same thing for about three weeks yeah but so is this a form
[02:42:18.920 --> 02:42:22.520]  of a haircut for the banksters what's that
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:26.840]  i mean how does this affect the banksters then oh this is good for them
[02:42:26.840 --> 02:42:29.880]  so it's not a haircut make loans and make more money because
[02:42:29.880 --> 02:42:33.480]  they're buying money over in europe uh paying one percent
[02:42:33.480 --> 02:42:36.680]  sure and then if they deposited with the european central bank
[02:42:36.680 --> 02:42:40.280]  they get a quarter of a percent so who does it hurt then everybody who's on
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:43.160]  fixed incomes with the inflationary result
[02:42:43.160 --> 02:42:47.880]  yeah absolutely not only over there but the united states because a lot of
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:52.600]  that money is going to drift into the u.s market
[02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:55.400]  see these are things that most people don't think about
[02:42:55.400 --> 02:43:00.120]  jamey diamond does because he runs a bank well i think like the banker because
[02:43:00.120 --> 02:43:03.720]  i know where he's coming from and that's the advantage of having
[02:43:03.720 --> 02:43:07.960]  the experience i've had in those markets being able to tell
[02:43:07.960 --> 02:43:11.560]  what's important to these people and why they're doing what they're doing
[02:43:11.560 --> 02:43:15.000]  now bob i want to talk about iran uh here
[02:43:15.000 --> 02:43:19.960]  in a moment after we go to this short clip um but i want to discuss after i ran
[02:43:19.960 --> 02:43:22.680]  false flag events because the top israeli intelligence
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:25.400]  officers come out and said pearl harbour style attack
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:30.040]  will be pre-text for war on iran jerusalem post article implies u.s
[02:43:30.040 --> 02:43:32.840]  will stage provocations justify military assault
[02:43:32.840 --> 02:43:38.200]  because of the fact that we've exposed false flags provocateur events uh
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:42.440]  frame ups self-inflicted wounds inside jobs
[02:43:42.440 --> 02:43:48.840]  that's now entered the uh nomenclature out there
[02:43:48.840 --> 02:43:53.800]  and so that damages the tool but it's still such a good tool for governments
[02:43:53.800 --> 02:43:56.360]  uh i want to get your take on whether or not they'll use it but i just wanted to
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:43:59.880]  use an example from popular culture here this is from the movie
[02:43:59.880 --> 02:44:05.960]  v for vendetta uh where the detectives who are you know
[02:44:05.960 --> 02:44:10.680]  outside of the internal security police uh are going to meet with a doctor who
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:13.720]  was at this uh prison camp where they were doing medical
[02:44:13.720 --> 02:44:17.560]  experiments to find out why everybody involved in it is being killed
[02:44:17.560 --> 02:44:22.040]  uh by uh the hero v and of course really the doctor's been dead for a while
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:27.720]  anyways it's v dressed up uh like the doctor uh but but but here they are
[02:44:27.720 --> 02:44:32.760]  discussing a fictional false flag the reason i use a fictional false flag
[02:44:32.760 --> 02:44:35.800]  to illustrate real false flags a lot of people have
[02:44:35.800 --> 02:44:41.080]  walls built in their minds where they can't discuss a real false flag like
[02:44:41.080 --> 02:44:44.280]  gulf of tonka or nine eleven or operation ajax
[02:44:44.280 --> 02:44:47.960]  because there's too much emotion involved but if it's in a movie
[02:44:47.960 --> 02:44:51.720]  you can understand how the government stages an event
[02:44:51.720 --> 02:44:56.120]  to not just create fear but also make money on the cure
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:44:58.920]  and uh that's undoubtedly where all this is going with the new york times
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:02.920]  article engineer doomsday with all these airborne pathogens bird
[02:45:02.920 --> 02:45:07.160]  flu mousepox swine flu that kill over 90 of those that come in
[02:45:07.160 --> 02:45:11.160]  contact with it and the government's ordering this brewed up by the thousands
[02:45:11.160 --> 02:45:15.160]  of gallons all over the country and it's not because they want to play patty
[02:45:15.160 --> 02:45:19.480]  cake folks uh so uh let's go ahead and go to this clip here it is
[02:45:19.480 --> 02:45:23.800]  our story begins as these stories often do with a young
[02:45:23.800 --> 02:45:28.840]  up-and-coming politician he's a deeply religious man and a member of the
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:33.320]  conservative party he's completely single-minded and has no regard for the
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:36.600]  political process the more power he attains the more
[02:45:36.600 --> 02:45:41.880]  obvious his zealot training the more aggressive his support has become
[02:45:41.880 --> 02:45:47.160]  eventually his party launches a special project in the name of national security
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:51.240]  at first it's believed to be a search for biological weapons i was pursued
[02:45:51.240 --> 02:45:57.240]  without regard to its cost however the true goal of this project is power
[02:45:57.240 --> 02:46:00.600]  complete and total hegemonic domination
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:06.520]  the project however ends violently but the efforts of those involved are not
[02:46:06.520 --> 02:46:10.600]  in vain but a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of the
[02:46:10.600 --> 02:46:15.640]  victims imagine a virus the most terrifying virus
[02:46:15.640 --> 02:46:19.720]  you can and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure
[02:46:19.720 --> 02:46:24.360]  but if your ultimate goal is power how best to use such a weapon
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:28.840]  or at this point in our story that along comes a spider
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:32.440]  he is a man seemingly without a conscience for whom the ends always
[02:46:32.440 --> 02:46:36.120]  justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not
[02:46:36.120 --> 02:46:39.800]  be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself
[02:46:39.800 --> 02:46:43.480]  three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack a school a tube
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:47.720]  station and a water treatment plant several hundred die within the first
[02:46:47.720 --> 02:46:51.080]  few weeks that three waters has in fact been contaminated
[02:46:51.080 --> 02:46:54.600]  authorities are attempting to control its deadly spread set a wave of
[02:46:54.600 --> 02:46:58.280]  destruction throughout the underground fueled by the media
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:02.520]  fear and panic spread quickly fracturing and dividing the country into that
[02:47:02.520 --> 02:47:06.200]  last the true goal comes into view before the
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:09.640]  saint mary's crises no one would have predicted the results of the election
[02:47:09.640 --> 02:47:16.200]  that year no one and then not long after the election low and behold a miracle
[02:47:16.200 --> 02:47:20.360]  some believed it was the work of god himself but it was a pharmaceutical
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:26.120]  company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:31.160]  a year later several extremists have tried found guilty and executed while a
[02:47:31.160 --> 02:47:35.080]  memorial is built to canonize their victims
[02:47:35.080 --> 02:47:40.040]  but the end result the true genius of the plan was the fear
[02:47:40.040 --> 02:47:43.640]  fear became the ultimate tool of this government and through it our politician
[02:47:43.640 --> 02:47:47.000]  was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:56.200]  high johnson the rest is they say his history
[02:47:56.200 --> 02:48:00.920]  now there it is from a movie but bob what do you make of all these reports
[02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:03.640]  that we talked about a decade ago but now are admitted
[02:48:03.640 --> 02:48:06.920]  where they're producing according to baltimore sun
[02:48:06.920 --> 02:48:13.480]  thousands of gallons at 36 facilities across the country of every airborne
[02:48:13.480 --> 02:48:18.680]  weaponized mega death weapon you could ever imagine a bola
[02:48:18.680 --> 02:48:25.320]  mousepox uh multiple flues and then admitting it
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:30.520]  and they're just sitting there on just just uh and obviously they're they're
[02:48:30.520 --> 02:48:33.640]  thinking about releasing it and blaming it on al qaeda
[02:48:33.640 --> 02:48:37.640]  or other affiliated imaginary mythical easter bunny groups
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:41.880]  i mean you can see what they're getting ready for bob
[02:48:41.880 --> 02:48:48.760]  well it's total war and uh that would take the population down considerably
[02:48:48.760 --> 02:48:54.520]  and uh it would also put people in the position
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:58.520]  even if they wanted to because of their illnesses
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:02.600]  even if they didn't die to be able to channel challenge whatever authority
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.680]  was in place and so uh you know i can see them
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:10.920]  doing such things as diabolical as they are
[02:49:10.920 --> 02:49:14.680]  yeah well i listen folks there's a very good chance whether it's this year or
[02:49:14.680 --> 02:49:17.880]  10 years from now i've read all the eugenics documents the
[02:49:17.880 --> 02:49:22.120]  globalist proof of what they're planning all the preconditioning
[02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:27.000]  i'm telling you that they're planning to do this it's in the cards well the
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.000]  women they play the card i don't know but this is their big ace in the hole
[02:49:31.000 --> 02:49:34.920]  and so just remember out there some of you if we don't turn this around now
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:38.520]  when you lose your family or whatever just remember who really did it and
[02:49:38.520 --> 02:49:43.880]  remember i warned you the wages of not waking up is death
[02:49:43.880 --> 02:49:50.760]  bob chevin that is a cold hard fact and if we do not get ron paul in office
[02:49:50.760 --> 02:49:53.560]  we can expect those kind of things are going to happen
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:57.160]  along with a lot of other terrible things
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:03.240]  and so that's our job this is the last shot of doing everything legally
[02:50:03.240 --> 02:50:06.440]  because after that everything is going to degenerate
[02:50:06.440 --> 02:50:09.720]  uh is it going to be a war of course but when
[02:50:09.720 --> 02:50:14.440]  i don't think anybody knows well we've seen but seeing playing games uh with
[02:50:14.440 --> 02:50:20.840]  their uh their big ships now and uh we we've seen uh the uh
[02:50:20.840 --> 02:50:25.080]  uh the banking system uh shut off to aran
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:29.400]  uh we've seen their clients who buy oil oil from them
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:33.160]  uh being told that they can't use their oil uh that's warfare
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:37.000]  yeah i mean it's on i mean it's on and then we're still having a debate about
[02:50:37.000 --> 02:50:40.200]  whether a war is already started when they're admittedly blowing up bases
[02:50:40.200 --> 02:50:44.280]  inside iran bob that's right and they have the
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:48.040]  temerity to blow up people in the middle of the city
[02:50:48.040 --> 02:50:51.560]  scientists who are working on the nuclear project
[02:50:51.560 --> 02:50:54.760]  just a couple of days off the charts and saying stay there bob we got to come
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:57.560]  back with calls in the next two segments we'll do five minutes of overdrive
[02:50:57.560 --> 02:51:01.320]  today but i've studied the thing well i'll tell you about when we get back
[02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:04.280]  do you suffer from low functioning adrenal or thyroid
[02:51:04.280 --> 02:51:07.160]  did you know that mercury from your dental feelings comes off of your teeth
[02:51:07.160 --> 02:51:11.160]  both as a vapor and as particles into your body wherever mercury deposits in
[02:51:11.160 --> 02:51:14.200]  your body it stops cells from functioning normally animal studies
[02:51:14.200 --> 02:51:17.960]  show that mercury causes kidney function to drop by 60 percent mercury
[02:51:17.960 --> 02:51:21.880]  deposited into your adrenals or thyroid will cause a corresponding drop in
[02:51:21.880 --> 02:51:24.040]  function the number one method by which your body
[02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:27.640]  detoxifies itself of mercury is glutathione the number one
[02:51:27.640 --> 02:51:31.320]  superfood that helps turn on all 10 trillion cells of your body to produce
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:35.240]  glutathione is non-denatured whey protein from grass-fed cows
[02:51:35.240 --> 02:51:38.760]  after investigating most high-end whey proteins on the market

[02:55:59.000 --> 02:56:02.920]  what they found out from their allies as well as enemies

[02:56:54.440 --> 02:56:58.040]  time i have as well to combat the uh the delusions
[02:56:58.040 --> 02:57:01.480]  descending upon humanity but um real quick on the
[02:57:01.480 --> 02:57:04.840]  anti-grip for sure there was a an episode years ago where there's i think the
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:07.960]  president was coming through mayberry now i distinctly remember that the shot of
[02:57:07.960 --> 02:57:11.960]  a guy standing on the sidewalk and downtown mayberry kind of protesting
[02:57:11.960 --> 02:57:15.960]  and he told them a big sign and it said it either says down with the gold standard
[02:57:15.960 --> 02:57:19.960]  or no to the gold standard i just thought i'd bring that one up
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:22.680]  real quick so a little propaganda against gold oh no
[02:57:22.680 --> 02:57:24.520]  no undoubtedly there was some in there as well
[02:57:24.520 --> 02:57:27.720]  talk to one of my guys who shows it to his kids and he says yeah it's one of
[02:57:27.720 --> 02:57:30.280]  the better shows but it's got propaganda in it as well
[02:57:30.280 --> 02:57:34.680]  do you have any questions or comments for myself or bob yeah i wanted to ask you
[02:57:34.680 --> 02:57:39.960]  gentlemen both if you've ever heard of um the capstone the concept for a capstone
[02:57:39.960 --> 02:57:43.080]  concept for joint operations.
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:47.680]  The capstone concept, I mean is that unified command?
[02:57:47.680 --> 02:57:54.400]  Yeah, it's a COG and basically it's a government document you can find on the internet and
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:58.120]  it's capstone as in the capstone over the pyramid on the back of the dollar.
[02:57:58.120 --> 02:58:02.880]  But it's the plan of how they're going to use, they're going to divert the American
[02:58:02.880 --> 02:58:07.400]  people and trick them into accepting militarization of the streets of America.
[02:58:07.400 --> 02:58:08.920]  No, I haven't seen that.
[02:58:08.920 --> 02:58:09.920]  What do I Google?
[02:58:09.920 --> 02:58:10.920]  Capstone COG?
[02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:15.240]  Just capstone concept for joint operations and you'll find it.

[02:58:19.280 --> 02:58:21.360]  Capstone concept for joint operations.

[02:58:22.440 --> 02:58:23.440]  Thank you so much.
[02:58:23.440 --> 02:58:25.240]  We're going to get Bob's brief take on that.

[03:00:09.560 --> 03:00:25.760]  Hi Alex.
[03:00:25.760 --> 03:00:32.160]  I wanted to ask you about, you mentioned something about prescriptions and shots.
[03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:38.560]  Like, I got a call from the center of disease control, and they sent me all this stuff in
[03:00:38.560 --> 03:00:43.360]  the mail, they want to know if my child's a predate on shots.
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:47.560]  Yeah, there's massive harassment by the feds of just everybody trying to force hundreds
[03:00:47.560 --> 03:00:51.520]  of new shots on people, and you go to the grocery store, there's signs everywhere, you
[03:00:51.520 --> 03:00:56.780]  go to the drugstore, they're in your face, pushing it on you, because people are waking
[03:00:56.780 --> 03:01:00.560]  up statistically to the vaccine, so now they're upping the propaganda.
[03:01:00.560 --> 03:01:02.360]  Bob, you want to comment on this?
[03:01:02.360 --> 03:01:07.280]  Yeah, I understand that some of the stores are giving discounts if you'll take shots.
[03:01:07.280 --> 03:01:08.280]  Yeah.
[03:01:08.280 --> 03:01:10.280]  Yeah, that's because they care about you, Bob.
[03:01:10.280 --> 03:01:18.440]  Yeah, they really do, and they love to give me some shots, probably 45s, but yeah, the
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:23.280]  people are waking up to it, there's absolutely no question, and having to shove it down people's
[03:01:23.280 --> 03:01:31.240]  throats, and that's, you know, that's what this young lady has received here, is really
[03:01:31.240 --> 03:01:32.240]  unusual.
[03:01:32.240 --> 03:01:34.760]  There's a great deal of work and cost to go to.
[03:01:34.760 --> 03:01:39.240]  Well, I did see it a couple months ago, actually, it is new news, but in fact, guys, type it
[03:01:39.240 --> 03:01:40.240]  in real fast.
[03:01:40.240 --> 03:01:44.760]  Centers for Disease Control now is going to people's houses, not just sending a mail,
[03:01:44.760 --> 03:01:48.920]  and then they're funding locals to do it as well, and like demanding you take shots.
[03:01:48.920 --> 03:01:51.360]  A few months ago, I played a news clip where they come to the door and they say, we're
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:55.920]  here to shoot your daughter up, and the lady tells them where they can go, but man, they're
[03:01:55.920 --> 03:01:58.160]  just trying to trick you into filling that out.
[03:01:58.160 --> 03:02:04.040]  I would put that in the circular, or you could scan it in and email it to tipsandinfowars.com
[03:02:04.040 --> 03:02:05.880]  and we'll do an article on it.
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:09.800]  I mean, it's already out there, but it's always good to see the document.
[03:02:09.800 --> 03:02:14.720]  I told them that I just lied and told them I didn't have any children here because I
[03:02:14.720 --> 03:02:18.120]  refuse to give my children shots if they don't need them.
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:21.320]  Alright, man, I'm not going to tell you what to do, and I'm not going to say you're wrong,
[03:02:21.320 --> 03:02:22.920]  but it's best to never lie.
[03:02:22.920 --> 03:02:28.200]  You don't have to answer government questions, and it's just best, it's just best to never
[03:02:28.200 --> 03:02:32.880]  even, you know, in fact, you never filled anything out, nothing ever even happened.
[03:02:32.880 --> 03:02:37.440]  I mean, I would not fill anything out of these miscreant scum, okay, I just want to make
[03:02:37.440 --> 03:02:42.440]  sure your daughter gets cancer or your son gets cancer, and they use taxpayer money to
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:43.440]  pay for it.
[03:02:43.440 --> 03:02:48.440]  I mean, look, I've had census at my door saying you'll tell me about your stocks and
[03:02:48.440 --> 03:02:52.680]  bonds in your toilet, you know, I got the long form, and I said, you will get off my
[03:02:52.680 --> 03:02:57.920]  front porch or I'm going to remove you, and they said, well, you know, this is against
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:01.400]  the law, and I said, no, it's not scumbag, it's called the Fourth of Fifth Amendment,
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:06.520]  I get off my porch, they're trying to peck at us until we submit, hey, we're going to
[03:03:06.520 --> 03:03:09.840]  stick our hands down your pants at the airport, hey, you're going to fill out all these forms
[03:03:09.840 --> 03:03:14.080]  for us, no, they're a bunch of trash, you see what I'm saying, ma'am?

[03:03:49.080 --> 03:03:50.080]  No.
[03:03:50.080 --> 03:03:54.200]  Okay, we were coming today to give her a Tdap if she hasn't had it done yet.
[03:03:54.200 --> 03:03:55.840]  Get the f*** off my house.
[03:03:55.840 --> 03:04:01.080]  Hey, look, that's everything, that's total color of law, saying it's a mandate, which
[03:04:01.080 --> 03:04:04.760]  isn't a law, it's like, we're control freaks, we say so.
[03:04:04.760 --> 03:04:10.480]  But now they passed a law where they give your child the shot without even telling you
[03:04:10.480 --> 03:04:12.280]  at home.
[03:04:12.280 --> 03:04:21.920]  It's just California is a Soviet empire, Nazi-loving, scumbag criminal, destroyed area.
[03:04:21.920 --> 03:04:24.360]  But Bob Chapman, final comments on that.
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:31.040]  You spent 36 years there and I escaped in 1994, and you're absolutely correct.
[03:04:31.040 --> 03:04:34.360]  But I mean, Bob, it's total color of law.
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:38.160]  They just show up and say, we're going to give her a shot and try to go in the house.
[03:04:38.160 --> 03:04:45.520]  There's no law, it's just it's pure con artist.
[03:04:45.520 --> 03:04:47.200]  Bob Chapman, Lord Willem, we'll see you back.
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:49.680]  We don't love us anymore, that's for sure.
[03:04:49.680 --> 03:04:51.200]  Oh, they care about us, Bob.
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:55.960]  It was great having you on with us and we'll talk to you again soon, my friend.
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:56.960]  Got you.
[03:04:56.960 --> 03:04:57.960]  Bye-bye.
[03:04:57.960 --> 03:04:58.960]  See you next Friday.
[03:04:58.960 --> 03:04:59.960]  All right, see you back this Sunday.
[03:04:59.960 --> 03:05:23.960]  Bye-bye.
