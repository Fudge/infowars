[07:06.600 --> 07:10.080]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[07:10.080 --> 07:13.720]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and
[07:13.720 --> 07:17.560]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[07:17.560 --> 07:21.120]  our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of

[08:05.200 --> 08:15.080]  lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[08:15.080 --> 08:21.160]  well I'm I am here to tell you my friends that if you are just joining us
[08:21.160 --> 08:27.120]  here for the first time this is a very important radio transmission that you are
[08:27.120 --> 08:34.320]  not going to want to miss on this Wednesday 12th day of September 2012
[08:34.320 --> 08:39.360]  you have found it the tip of the spear at the front lines in the global fight
[08:39.360 --> 08:45.560]  against the private banking cartels that fund and run Al Qaeda that fund and run
[08:45.560 --> 08:51.080]  the major mafias of the globe and that control the issuance of currency and
[08:51.080 --> 08:55.680]  credit and who are openly attempting to establish a private corporate world
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.280]  government where you will face scan and hand scan to buy and sell I know you've
[09:02.280 --> 09:06.040]  heard about that the book written thousands of years ago but regardless
[09:06.040 --> 09:09.160]  whether you believe in the Bible or not this is what they're attempting to set
[09:09.160 --> 09:15.320]  up so look out because their religion is eugenics you know it today as
[09:15.320 --> 09:19.320]  transhumanism they believe that they are forcibly taking control of human
[09:19.320 --> 09:23.240]  development they call it evolution and have decided that the majority of us
[09:23.240 --> 09:30.000]  will be exterminated once the global digital skin is in place once all the
[09:30.000 --> 09:34.840]  smart meters all the control appliances once the smart dust is in place once
[09:34.840 --> 09:38.560]  they have combat robots on every street corner they will begin releasing
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.760]  bio weapons wiping out large portions of the world they will pose as saviors
[09:43.760 --> 09:49.000]  blaming terrorists when they do this and then corralling the survivors into more
[09:49.000 --> 09:54.040]  and more compact cities killing us in phases I have reverse engineered their
[09:54.040 --> 09:58.120]  entire program most of it is declassified in public because they're so
[09:58.120 --> 10:02.520]  arrogant they openly discussed their plans I would say over 90% of what I
[10:02.520 --> 10:06.760]  just stated is on record the rest is my reverse engineering which has been
[10:06.760 --> 10:10.360]  proven to be frighteningly accurate again I'm gonna explain this to you we
[10:10.360 --> 10:17.200]  are in a red level species emergency red level species emergency the species is
[10:17.200 --> 10:24.400]  being gilded being domesticated being dumbed down in preparation for what Dick
[10:24.400 --> 10:30.080]  Cheney called for in the September 20th 2000 rebuilding America's defenses the
[10:30.080 --> 10:36.680]  use of race specific bio weapons to first begin wiping out certain ethnic
[10:36.680 --> 10:43.440]  groups again ladies and gentlemen we are at a red level point unfortunately my
[10:43.440 --> 10:48.120]  analysis of more than a decade ago when I really clicked on their current
[10:48.120 --> 10:53.160]  program and and really got the big picture the first to really reverse
[10:53.160 --> 10:57.400]  engineer it to this level I'm not bragging just that I was the first to
[10:57.400 --> 11:01.720]  really click to it unfortunately now we're so deep into this it's all been
[11:01.720 --> 11:05.640]  confirmed that it's worse than I thought even so I wish I could tell you it was
[11:05.640 --> 11:10.280]  that I was wrong and that I overestimated them I underestimated
[11:10.280 --> 11:14.240]  they're going ahead with the program they're going ahead with the program
[11:14.240 --> 11:19.200]  you're not listening to science fiction here you're listening to the real world
[11:19.200 --> 11:24.000]  we told you they would hand the Middle East over to al-qaeda years ago we told
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.160]  you they would then start a war with al-qaeda doubling back while the master
[11:28.160 --> 11:32.520]  al-qaeda controllers send their jihadis out to be killed it's like I'm going to
[11:32.520 --> 11:38.360]  break down how this deal really works here in just a moment and then I want to
[11:38.360 --> 11:42.240]  start laying out where the globalists are going to take us now that said we
[11:42.240 --> 11:49.360]  have Dinesh D'Souza former Reagan administration official best-selling author
[11:49.360 --> 11:53.160]  and of course he has one of the top films in the country in the last three
[11:53.160 --> 11:59.760]  weeks old Obama's America 2012 or Obama's America 2016 what it would look
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.400]  like if he stayed in power and we're teleprompter free news here I don't go
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.400]  off notes like occasionally butcher information but we are going to have him
[12:08.400 --> 12:17.680]  on the writer and director of 2016 Obama's America we're going to be having
[12:17.680 --> 12:25.200]  him on the show at the start of the next hour then we have retired top NBA star
[12:25.200 --> 12:30.760]  Theo Ratliff joining us with Dr. Wallach and to talk about what crew
[12:30.760 --> 12:34.040]  supplementation did for him because this is one of the biggest secrets out
[12:34.040 --> 12:37.760]  there the globalists don't want you to be aware of so we look forward to that
[12:37.760 --> 12:43.240]  and then we'll also be opening the phones up on the state of the world here but
[12:43.240 --> 12:46.560]  if you're a new listener and you hear me you know ranting and raving about how
[12:46.560 --> 12:49.320]  they're going to exterminate everyone you need to understand ladies and
[12:49.320 --> 12:54.800]  gentlemen there have been thousands of covert operations declassified and in
[12:54.800 --> 13:02.640]  some cases one operation out of thousands killed thousands and I've
[13:02.640 --> 13:06.480]  listed off things you can write down and then search engine them and find it for
[13:06.480 --> 13:14.280]  yourself over 4,000 u.s. foster children radiated to death in the 40s 50s and 60s
[13:14.280 --> 13:19.960]  by the Department of Energy Department of Defense they took little kids and put
[13:19.960 --> 13:24.200]  them in chambers and fried them and it wasn't to test what radiation did that
[13:24.200 --> 13:26.760]  they could do that with other mammals they knew what it would do it was to
[13:26.760 --> 13:33.280]  test and create a culture of absolute mass murder and death they then had
[13:33.280 --> 13:38.800]  Israel prove their worthiness to the New World Order who irradiate 110,000 plus of
[13:38.800 --> 13:43.920]  their children that's declassified ringworm children China delivered the
[13:43.920 --> 13:50.440]  greatest sacrifices aborting hundreds of millions in the last 30 years or so
[13:50.440 --> 13:57.960]  also killing 85 million 84 million the numbers vary Chinese history CIA says
[13:57.960 --> 14:03.120]  60 plus million of their people they were put in power by the Rothschilds and
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.640]  Rockefellers Chen Kai-shek was shut down this is now been declassified old-timers
[14:07.640 --> 14:12.360]  told me about it when I first got on air but it was only rumors then and anecdotal
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.280]  evidence it was declassified a few years ago it's even on history channel that the
[14:16.280 --> 14:22.640]  CIA in 1949 didn't put Mao Zedong in they also helped put Pol Pot in to kill
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.200]  30% of the population to wipe out the Cambodian intelligence to you so they'll
[14:27.200 --> 14:33.120]  use fascists they'll use Khmer Rouge they'll use Communists as Carol Quigley said
[14:33.120 --> 14:38.000]  they'll use anybody this is about absolute maximum power and they will
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.560]  use the Muslim extremist to jihad and take over and then use the fear of that
[14:42.560 --> 14:48.320]  to take over our lives so you have to understand that we're in the we are in
[14:48.320 --> 14:53.960]  the grip of the most sinister scientifically focused evil the world
[14:53.960 --> 15:01.000]  has ever seen and only full awakening to it will give us any chance to stop it
[15:01.000 --> 15:06.680]  now let me just give you a smattering of the headlines here okay US ambassador
[15:06.680 --> 15:13.840]  to Libya killed drug to the streets Muammar Gaddafi style by al-Qaeda that
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.600]  our criminal government put in charge there and they think you're so stupid
[15:18.600 --> 15:21.640]  now they're saying oh yes horrible al-Qaeda and not putting out they put
[15:21.640 --> 15:28.960]  them in new DARPA robot can autonomously track and kill people all LS three
[15:28.960 --> 15:32.840]  robot put out by the big defense contractors they're rolling them all
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.360]  out they and again they're not gonna send out SWAT teams to try to hunt you
[15:37.360 --> 15:40.960]  down if you've evaded you and your family being picked up to be brought to
[15:40.960 --> 15:47.720]  the FEMA reeducation and well extermination center they're not gonna
[15:47.720 --> 15:51.880]  be doing that they're gonna send out hundred killer robots on you so be made
[15:51.880 --> 15:59.440]  aware that I was told that by Marine Corps Colonel 14 years ago and I told
[15:59.440 --> 16:02.120]  you about hundred killer robots now they're starting to bring them out and
[16:02.120 --> 16:04.160]  show them to you because they're getting ready to put them on the streets
[16:04.160 --> 16:13.520]  Japan is already putting sentinel robots on the streets Foxcom that runs the
[16:13.520 --> 16:20.600]  slave factories for Al Gore and and Apple now is in is enforcing one-shot
[16:20.600 --> 16:24.840]  policy forced abortions that's mainstream news today they are now having
[16:24.840 --> 16:30.960]  sentinel robots installed to oversee the slave labor so we're now entering hell
[16:30.960 --> 16:37.240]  grid and they're gonna use China and the health the the hell they've created as a
[16:37.240 --> 16:42.000]  as an economic implosion point a black hole to make everybody compete with that
[16:42.000 --> 16:46.680]  to pull humanity down the slave level globalism isn't to empower it's to
[16:46.680 --> 16:51.520]  enslave it's the race to the bottom but Al Gore on Larry King live looked at
[16:51.520 --> 16:59.160]  Ross Perot and said that's ridiculous Ross Larry this is a good deal when they

[24:12.040 --> 24:15.760]  want to use ray specific bio weapons yeah I mean it was even in my local paper
[24:15.760 --> 24:19.840]  one of the few papers to decry it was the Austin American statesman which is
[24:19.840 --> 24:22.680]  generally a horrible publication but they actually got it right back when
[24:22.680 --> 24:26.520]  Cheney wrote about that and the point is this is what the scientific controllers
[24:26.520 --> 24:31.160]  are into they see you as dumb animals and then they set up a culture where they
[24:31.160 --> 24:37.240]  promote the fact that it's cool to be domesticated jellyfish which becomes a
[24:37.240 --> 24:43.040]  self-fulfilling prophecy and I mean take the troops they wouldn't let them use
[24:43.040 --> 24:47.440]  DU until 1990 and even then you had to have decontamination and now they just
[24:47.440 --> 24:52.120]  say oh use it shoot it be around it clean your gun don't even worry about it
[24:52.120 --> 24:57.040]  it's a death sentence I mean you can't get around the fact that a
[24:57.040 --> 25:01.920]  scientific technocratic elite why have Western governments tested stuff on
[25:01.920 --> 25:06.360]  little kids that they knew would kill them why have they done Joseph mingle a
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.600]  type experiments that make mingle a look like a choir boy literally why did
[25:11.600 --> 25:15.240]  they approve microwave cell phones when the studies in the 70s showed brain
[25:15.240 --> 25:20.560]  tumors in the mice and the monkeys there's thousands of studies thousands
[25:20.560 --> 25:25.960]  hundreds a year come out of course it gives you brain cancer it vibrates the
[25:25.960 --> 25:31.520]  DNA it breaks the DNA causing cell mutation that's in all the studies it
[25:31.520 --> 25:36.760]  and now Cheryl Crowe's got a brain tumor yeah how's that for you rock star I
[25:36.760 --> 25:40.560]  wish you weren't dying but I guarantee you she's gonna go get her brain shopped
[25:40.560 --> 25:44.600]  up she can do all the stuff and end up dying probably and and she'll be out
[25:44.600 --> 25:48.160]  there raised money for cancer raised money for cancer raised money for
[25:48.160 --> 25:53.280]  treatments instead of find out why why like I shouldn't even be attacking her
[25:53.280 --> 25:55.960]  try to get her on she's actually saying the cell phone probably did it you're
[25:55.960 --> 26:00.480]  right lady I'm mad though I'm mad for my family I'm mad that I use cell phones

[26:04.000 --> 26:08.560]  better but still it I can't believe I I kept wireless out of my house for about
[26:08.560 --> 26:13.120]  a year after I moved and I suddenly just capitulated and put it in it's out of my
[26:13.120 --> 26:17.920]  house today I'm mad at my shelf I'm weak if I sound like I'm mad at Cheryl
[26:17.920 --> 26:21.920]  Crowe I'm not I'm mad she's dying because let me tell you I don't worry about dying
[26:21.920 --> 26:27.520]  my shelf but I tell you there's something about women in your family and and and
[26:27.520 --> 26:31.400]  my son as well but we're just but men are genetically designed to not be as
[26:31.400 --> 26:36.800]  upset about men other men I worry about my grandmother I worry about my mother
[26:36.800 --> 26:41.360]  I worry about my wife and my daughters and because they're so innocent and good
[26:41.360 --> 26:45.480]  and sweet and soft and you just want to protect them and you know they're under
[26:45.480 --> 26:51.000]  attack and you know this evil just continues on and on and on and never
[26:51.000 --> 26:55.320]  abates and I've got all the documents in my film in game what is the in game
[26:55.320 --> 27:00.840]  calm is a online website with the bibliography of the film let's put it on
[27:00.840 --> 27:05.560]  screen please what is the end game calm or in game the movie calm and it's all
[27:05.560 --> 27:08.120]  the quotes where they say they're gonna build a world government release
[27:08.120 --> 27:15.640]  bio weapons and kill us I mean this is not a game ladies and gentlemen the FBI
[27:15.640 --> 27:21.080]  has visited Professor Pianca who says soon the airborne Ebola will be released
[27:21.080 --> 27:25.720]  and 90% will die and his family's ready you know this isn't a game when he gave
[27:25.720 --> 27:29.440]  a speech at the Texas Academy of Sciences he got a standing ovation for
[27:29.440 --> 27:33.400]  three minutes it was reported in the news with the Texas scientist he gets
[27:33.400 --> 27:41.680]  awards all the world crying when he projected a full screen of skulls
[27:42.160 --> 27:48.000]  behind me at the PowerPoint presentation these people are a death coat
[27:48.000 --> 27:53.320]  they are in control they're trying to mop up the free internet and what's left
[27:53.320 --> 27:58.040]  to talk radio you've got to make a full break with these people you've got to
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.800]  fully listen to me go check out my claims and find out they're true because
[28:02.800 --> 28:07.120]  that's why I'm fearless because we're walking dead ladies and gentlemen
[28:07.120 --> 28:10.920]  there's no future I'll use the Star Trek analogy because that seems to get
[28:10.920 --> 28:14.280]  through to people moving analogies
[28:15.240 --> 28:21.680]  wrath of con the ship's not gonna make it out of there when the weapon gets
[28:21.680 --> 28:26.440]  detonated spot knows everybody's dead and they don't go down there and get it
[28:26.440 --> 28:30.800]  fixed he goes in there and gets radiated Captain Kirk comes in to open it up try
[28:30.800 --> 28:35.240]  a saving and the doctor says he's dead already that's what you've got to
[28:35.240 --> 28:39.680]  realize ladies and gentlemen most of us are not gonna live out our full lives
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.520]  already we're already been eating GMO we've already had vaccines we've already
[28:43.520 --> 28:47.840]  been drinking fluoride if we would have lived to 100 we're living to 50 we're
[28:47.840 --> 28:52.440]  dead already it's an important to make that decision he's another movie
[28:52.440 --> 28:56.480]  analogy the thing it's blown the generator in 10 hours they're all gonna
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.320]  be frozen to death the most important thing is they take that thing out so it
[29:00.320 --> 29:04.280]  doesn't make it to the mainland well we've got a global government run by our
[29:04.280 --> 29:09.880]  own species that see themselves as Morlocks and us as the Eloy HD Wells
[29:09.880 --> 29:14.880]  admitted that was an analogy of the elite versus us and the Morlocks feed on
[29:14.880 --> 29:20.640]  the Eloy and they're scientifically advanced we're not we're dumb but we're
[29:20.640 --> 29:26.240]  also virtuous they're evil and controlling and we've got to wake up to
[29:26.240 --> 29:31.000]  that and organize now or there's no future when I come back I'm getting into

[34:51.000 --> 34:55.280]  and where he says they're gonna have the Muslims take over the whole Middle
[34:55.280 --> 35:00.480]  East and spread into Russia Western Europe and Africa but but I mean is it
[35:00.480 --> 35:05.280]  just Obama doing all that or is it you know a lot bigger now what's behind all

[35:43.240 --> 35:47.920]  tech tech is fine but it's being designed to control us so we're gonna be
[35:47.920 --> 35:51.960]  going over that but first let's get to the big top story that I've been
[35:51.960 --> 35:57.320]  alluding to we actually have a photo here at info wars com with an excellent
[35:57.320 --> 36:03.680]  article by Tony cartelucci will put that up on screen it's in the article
[36:03.680 --> 36:10.240]  u.s. back terrorist murder u.s. own ambassador in libya and notice right
[36:10.240 --> 36:16.280]  there in the photo to the right of John McCain is Christopher Stevens the u.s.
[36:16.280 --> 36:21.920]  ambassador and they fly the al-qaeda flag over Benghazi over Tripoli that's
[36:21.920 --> 36:26.000]  been in the news they wear black uniforms with al-qaeda flag they've been
[36:26.000 --> 36:30.160]  given 10,000 missiles 2000 plus that was in the news even before it was in the
[36:30.160 --> 36:35.200]  news I talked to an Air Force officer on the flight back from Las Vegas shooting
[36:35.200 --> 36:38.080]  the show with Ventura last year the one where they had the coffin on board and
[36:38.080 --> 36:41.560]  he was he was flying it and he goes no the word is you're right it's over 2,000
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.120]  heat-seeking and radar missiles the point is is that I even confirmed it from
[36:45.120 --> 36:48.440]  him before it was even in the news I said it's thousands and he goes yeah it's
[36:48.440 --> 36:54.240]  about 10,000 over 2,000 guided the point is oh but but but al-qaeda might be in
[36:54.240 --> 36:59.240]  your five-year-old daughter's pants and we need a highway checkpoint randomly in
[36:59.240 --> 37:03.880]  Ohio by the TSA they just had one last week to just throw stuff out of your
[37:03.880 --> 37:08.880]  car but al-qaeda could have 10,000 missiles 2,000 of them they just aim
[37:08.880 --> 37:11.920]  them at the aircraft then it shoots right into the nose come where they got
[37:11.920 --> 37:18.920]  the radar or right into the engine you can't miss on takeoff or landing they
[37:18.920 --> 37:24.600]  just pull up by an airport mile away fire and then TSA can dance around and
[37:24.600 --> 37:28.680]  hey bring your daughter bring your son over here see I won't fly with them
[37:28.680 --> 37:34.200]  because of that they're like it don't matter Jones doesn't matter we're coming
[37:34.200 --> 37:39.880]  to the streets punk and TSA style security but it there it is in the photo
[37:39.880 --> 37:48.680]  us back terrorist murder us his own ambassador in Libya and there it is all
[37:48.680 --> 37:51.720]  admitted over a year and a half ago Webster Tarpoli went there we confirmed
[37:51.720 --> 37:56.400]  al-qaeda was coming out of Benghazi they had tanks they had planes and the
[37:56.400 --> 38:06.360]  media would run headlines all over the place about how they were heroes and
[38:06.360 --> 38:11.400]  they were just protesters and in Gaddafi was being mean and he had rape gangs
[38:11.400 --> 38:15.480]  with Viagra rape of course that wasn't true Saddam didn't throw babies out of
[38:15.480 --> 38:18.560]  incubators in Kuwait either that was later declassified it's totally fake but
[38:18.560 --> 38:23.200]  so what and then al-qaeda went in and just lined up tens of thousands of black
[38:23.200 --> 38:27.200]  Africans you know they're African they get to live there don't they just lined
[38:27.200 --> 38:30.280]  them up because a lot of the Saudi Arabians are incredibly racist towards
[38:30.280 --> 38:35.040]  black people just lined them up and just shot them and had but sometimes a
[38:35.040 --> 38:39.600]  bullet was too expensive so they there's lots of videos of families begging and
[38:39.600 --> 38:44.640]  the jihadis they've got the the machetes and they just never get tired of
[38:44.640 --> 38:48.600]  hacking people's arms off while they try to protect themselves here in America
[38:48.600 --> 38:52.120]  that'd be called assaulting the al-qaeda officer you put your arm up hack those
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.440]  wrists off and then just hack into that next labyrinth blood everywhere freedom
[38:58.440 --> 39:04.360]  fighting all the way and now and now they've been attacking for nine months
[39:04.360 --> 39:07.960]  in Syria taking families and we're gonna kill your whole family if you don't
[39:07.960 --> 39:12.080]  drive this suicide bomb into the police station and then they even go on the news
[39:12.080 --> 39:17.160]  and say oh Assad's massacring people but the videos come out it's al-qaeda
[39:17.160 --> 39:20.720]  chopping people's heads off throwing them off roofs blowing up churches
[39:20.720 --> 39:25.480]  murdering people desecrating the cross but that's okay that cuz they're
[39:25.480 --> 39:30.240]  fighting Assad who's been a stabilizing force and lets the Christians and Jews
[39:30.240 --> 39:32.840]  live there in peace some of the oldest Christian and Jewish communities in the
[39:32.840 --> 39:37.120]  world outside of Israel so that's what's really going on and now it's all
[39:37.120 --> 39:42.680]  admitted remember a month ago CFR said quote we need al-qaeda and how they're
[39:42.680 --> 39:47.600]  organizing things how they're the core and how they're doing a great and Saudi
[39:47.600 --> 39:51.280]  Arabia is arming them good old Saudi Arabia created by British intelligence
[39:51.280 --> 39:59.440]  over a hundred years ago Lawrence of Arabia in your face in your face and
[39:59.440 --> 40:03.800]  and it doesn't matter if they run al-qaeda they think you're so stupid they
[40:03.800 --> 40:11.720]  say the NSA is going to spy on you without warrants they say that they are
[40:11.720 --> 40:16.720]  going to take your rights and they're teaching the police don't worry about
[40:16.720 --> 40:20.480]  al-qaeda it's the gun owners libertarians conservatives people that say
[40:20.480 --> 40:26.640]  there's a new world order as the new world order is being announced and again
[40:26.640 --> 40:31.000]  the CFR said al-qaeda specter in Syria but went on to say quote we need al-qaeda
[40:31.000 --> 40:37.480]  if that's the same article you guys just type control if we need al-qaeda control
[40:37.480 --> 40:40.200]  left that and then it'll show in the article where it's like yeah they're
[40:40.200 --> 40:43.320]  kind of bad guys that we need them we need to use them against the Serbs in
[40:43.320 --> 40:47.200]  the 90s and then when the Serbs fight back oh it's a war crime we got to bomb
[40:47.200 --> 40:51.120]  your whole country with DU and watch your burnt effects explode and again they
[40:51.120 --> 40:54.800]  hate the Serbs they hate the American people they hate the Muslims the
[40:54.800 --> 40:57.720]  globalists will play everybody off against each other you're thinking
[40:57.720 --> 41:01.280]  there's a side here they just want us to kill each other and then they'll come
[41:01.280 --> 41:05.800]  in and rebuild everything and taxpayers expense
[41:05.800 --> 41:15.640]  and there it is the Free Syrian Army and needs al-qaeda now there is the quote
[41:15.640 --> 41:22.520]  yeah they are the main force they are the main force so here it is US back
[41:22.520 --> 41:26.360]  terrorist murder US own ambassador in Libya and you know I bring this up to
[41:26.360 --> 41:30.000]  mainland conservatives and they just go I'm like do you understand that they're
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.400]  saying you're the terrorists this whole homeland thing is set up for you but
[41:33.400 --> 41:37.200]  they've got like a sycophantic fetish about giving up liberties and loving
[41:37.200 --> 41:40.680]  black uniforms and torture and they're like but it was for the Muslims and I'm
[41:40.680 --> 41:44.720]  like the globalists will run the radical Muslims do you understand now they
[41:44.720 --> 41:48.640]  just go I just can't believe it yeah I hear what you're saying but what do you
[41:48.640 --> 41:57.440]  do what do you do and they just don't know how to respond so continuing here
[41:57.440 --> 42:01.800]  US back terrorist murder US own ambassador in Libya and then they're
[42:01.800 --> 42:04.680]  gonna put them in all these countries and as I predicted a year and a half ago
[42:04.680 --> 42:08.600]  in the Libyan thing started then they'll say there has to be invasions to kick
[42:08.600 --> 42:13.640]  al-qaeda out but that's only simulant armies they'll have like you know just
[42:13.640 --> 42:18.400]  mortar some hills say the US troops are victorious and then pull out and then
[42:18.400 --> 42:21.600]  al-qaeda is simply moved to the next place as they've been done against Russia
[42:21.600 --> 42:26.240]  against the Serbs and then against the United States that's the plan you
[42:26.240 --> 42:30.680]  understand the bankers run al-qaeda the New World Order runs al-qaeda but they
[42:30.680 --> 42:33.160]  don't want you worried about the New World Order so they want you to give
[42:33.160 --> 42:35.960]  your rights up in the name of al-qaeda while the New World Order is the real
[42:35.960 --> 42:42.760]  enemy so al-qaeda murders US ambassador and staff in Libya curtain emo prison
[42:42.760 --> 42:48.560]  planet calm please get these articles out to everyone US ambassador Libya killed
[42:48.560 --> 42:53.600]  in Benghazi attack US ambassador Libya and three embassy staff were killed in
[42:53.600 --> 42:58.160]  an attack on the Benghazi consulate and a staff house refugees stormed by
[42:58.160 --> 43:02.680]  Islamist that's that's al-qaeda folks out of Saudi Arabia began blaming America
[43:02.680 --> 43:07.680]  for a film they said insulted the Prophet Muhammad and see al-qaeda gets
[43:07.680 --> 43:11.760]  these jihadis who are real mind-controlled extremists culturally
[43:11.760 --> 43:16.000]  mind-controlled and so they're real they really think they're fighting a jihad
[43:16.000 --> 43:21.720]  and they're commanded by these double and triple agents that run al-CIA al-qaeda
[43:21.720 --> 43:27.320]  and so when something like this gets out there this YouTube video put out by
[43:27.320 --> 43:31.280]  the Reverend Jones and everything you know that's a style then it causes this
[43:31.280 --> 43:35.880]  class of civilizations right on time for the Iran attack and the globalists know
[43:35.880 --> 43:40.400]  the public so dumbed down they're now seeing irans behind this even though
[43:40.400 --> 43:44.600]  they're Shiite their arch enemy is the Sunnis and the extremist sect of the
[43:44.600 --> 43:50.120]  Sunnis though a hobbyist al-CIA does but there are got stacks here where like see

[44:27.880 --> 44:31.760]  it so like oh we'll send those to jail that we ordered to do it yeah we don't
[44:31.760 --> 44:36.840]  torture even though bush didn't put a book out bragging he'd ordered torture so
[44:36.840 --> 44:42.000]  US ambassador to Libya killed gunman attacked and set fire to US consulate
[44:42.000 --> 44:46.760]  in eastern city of Benghazi the cradle of last year's uprising you mean of the
[44:46.760 --> 44:52.680]  western funded proxy war against Muammar Gaddafi who invested his money with
[44:52.680 --> 44:56.800]  the West and with Nicholas Sarkozy and financed his election and tried to make
[44:56.800 --> 45:00.040]  a deal and they set him up that's what they do they don't want stabilization
[45:00.040 --> 45:06.880]  they want rapine death murder road warrior collapse late last night another
[45:06.880 --> 45:11.440]  assault was mounted on the US Embassy in Cairo California born ambassador
[45:11.440 --> 45:15.840]  Christopher Stevens was killed yet in his body drug around like Gaddafi's in
[45:15.840 --> 45:20.900]  the assault and then again we have we have John McCain with the ambassador
[45:20.900 --> 45:24.840]  looking like a Cheshire cat after they'd overthrown Libyan killed tens of
[45:24.840 --> 45:29.480]  thousands the killing just continues I mean they are just murdering the minority
[45:29.480 --> 45:34.040]  sects of Muslims they are killing the Shiites with pleasure they are blowing
[45:34.040 --> 45:38.840]  up the churches I mean it is fun but again the American people can't
[45:38.840 --> 45:42.600]  differentiate so it's like better get my routes up Elkada and they're like did
[45:42.600 --> 45:46.800]  you see Elkada burning on American rug yeah that our criminal government put
[45:46.800 --> 45:53.360]  in as they attacked the embassy in Cairo but all they know is you're seeing an
[45:53.360 --> 45:58.320]  American flag burn that's how dumb they think you are the T.S. Shader day's like
[45:58.320 --> 46:04.080]  gotta go in those pants you saw what Elkada did protesters attacked US
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.640]  diplomatic compounds in Egypt Libya and it's also going on in Afghanistan right
[46:07.640 --> 46:12.960]  now Cairo protesters scale US Embassy wall remove flag well the American flags
[46:12.960 --> 46:16.280]  been captured by the globalist now so it's not even our flag they wrap all
[46:16.280 --> 46:22.100]  their tyranny in it but there you go and they run Elkada I told you this class
[46:22.100 --> 46:25.480]  of civilizations was coming and when they're done don't worry the globalist
[46:25.480 --> 46:30.200]  they're gonna release a race specific weapon that's gonna kill the Arabic
[46:30.200 --> 46:38.840]  peoples first the the Central Asian slash Caucasoid group it's it's a I mean
[46:38.840 --> 46:43.400]  that whole group there is a mix of Asian bloodlines and white bloodlines with
[46:43.400 --> 46:46.760]  some African bloodlines that's why it's very hard but they studied it for a
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.680]  while that's been in the news to have a special weapon that just kills the
[46:50.680 --> 46:55.120]  Middle Easterners but Dick Cheney talks about that and it'll have some blowback
[46:55.120 --> 46:58.680]  kind of like AIDS is designed for Africans but it still can kill a northern
[46:58.680 --> 47:02.640]  European even though our cells don't have the main receptor sites if you don't
[47:02.640 --> 47:05.760]  have to you let the sites from methamphetamine use and things then it
[47:05.760 --> 47:12.200]  can actually if you're already in a collapse immune system collapse from
[47:12.200 --> 47:16.440]  hundreds of sexual partners a week and drug use then then a Caucasian can get
[47:16.440 --> 47:21.480]  HIV but it is a race weapon for Africans that's why some countries half the
[47:21.480 --> 47:26.600]  country has it so a little loving little global gift but don't worry don't worry
[47:26.600 --> 47:30.880]  though you'll get a bio weapon too next first they're gonna wipe those guys out
[47:30.880 --> 47:35.640]  but they got to let them burn everything down first so this is all part of a
[47:35.640 --> 47:40.440]  consolidation phase let's continue with what's really going on here okay we
[47:40.440 --> 47:44.880]  told you all this was coming and oh the poor ambassador we've got to fight
[47:44.880 --> 47:48.160]  al-Qaeda now they think you're so dumb that you won't even understand they put
[47:48.160 --> 47:52.840]  al-Qaeda in at info wars.com prison blood.com or all reporting on it I look
[47:52.840 --> 47:58.160]  at the photo was US ambassador lynched is the poll Joseph Watson question and
[47:58.160 --> 48:02.400]  yeah he looks like he actually wasn't shot as they're saying looks like he's
[48:02.400 --> 48:06.280]  pretty conscious in these photographs coming out and some some nice men
[48:06.280 --> 48:13.280]  having there oh you put over 40,000 to the sword ambassador helping with
[48:13.280 --> 48:20.840]  McCain and look what happened to you there you go and the jihadis are gonna
[48:20.840 --> 48:29.480]  have some fun with you man talk about sick but hey that's what it takes I mean
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.760]  you know you're a tough guy soldier man you're in there putting al-Qaeda in to
[48:33.760 --> 48:38.480]  rape and murder and kill everybody and it blew back on you didn't it punk well
[48:38.480 --> 48:42.000]  I'm not glad that guy's dead but I tell you he's a punk for putting al-Qaeda in
[48:42.000 --> 48:45.160]  there to chop up those little kids with machetes but I know they're just
[48:45.160 --> 48:49.040]  they're just North Africans you know they're not humans this guy's a human
[48:49.040 --> 48:53.000]  according to the globalist you know he he's been killed it's just terrible and
[48:53.000 --> 48:58.280]  here's the Cairo Tehran Express by the Washington Free Beacon and the Egyptian
[48:58.280 --> 49:02.960]  Iranian intelligence meeting prompt spheres of new Middle East terror
[49:02.960 --> 49:06.960]  axis and there's other articles conflating it and confusing it like
[49:06.960 --> 49:12.840]  Iran's involved and they got this fake feud going between US and Israel so they
[49:12.840 --> 49:15.880]  can act like they're not gonna attack Iran while the preparations are being
[49:15.880 --> 49:23.080]  made you believe any of that well then you're an idiot but this is the plan
[49:23.080 --> 49:26.320]  and I've basically broken it down now speaking of that I thought I'd talk
[49:26.320 --> 49:29.480]  about some of the freedom here in the West because it's really great now it
[49:29.480 --> 49:34.600]  ties into the Chinese model that the globalist designed mom sues police over
[49:34.600 --> 49:40.920]  arrest news to Houston and they admit that she was in her front yard in a
[49:40.920 --> 49:45.560]  cul-de-sac in a rural area and her children were on electric scooters the
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.240]  funny thing is when I lived inside the city we lived in a community and my
[49:49.240 --> 49:53.200]  children would be on scooters all day in the cul-de-sac with other kids well all
[49:53.200 --> 49:56.000]  the parents should be arrested by the way I wouldn't even watch them all the
[49:56.000 --> 50:00.240]  time I let them play in the cul-de-sac with the other kids and well there you
[50:00.240 --> 50:04.280]  go I've admitted my endangerment of my children I'm a horrible evil criminal
[50:04.280 --> 50:09.800]  that in a cul-de-sac off the road I let my children my god my gosh even ride
[50:09.800 --> 50:15.160]  bikes on the sidewalk whoa whoa you don't do that in a giant re-education camp
[50:15.160 --> 50:19.560]  here under the Zardos dome as one individual put it that I heard talking
[50:19.560 --> 50:25.640]  the other day mom sues police over arrest and here it is mom arrested and
[50:25.640 --> 50:29.400]  sent to jail for letting her kids play outside the cops pulled up she's even in
[50:29.400 --> 50:34.360]  the lawn chair watching them and the cops said endangerment slammer into the
[50:34.360 --> 50:39.080]  car handcuffs CPS comes gets the kids she's fighting back though she got the
[50:39.080 --> 50:41.800]  charges overthrown they knew they couldn't get a jury conviction they
[50:41.800 --> 50:46.680]  tried though and they got her though they put her in an orange jumpsuit told

[54:17.160 --> 54:23.560]  all right we are back as I desperately try to alert humanity to the
[54:23.560 --> 54:28.160]  incredible tyranny during the break we had Fox News on back there in the
[54:28.160 --> 54:36.840]  coffee room and sure enough they've dispatched drones over Libya now I said
[54:36.840 --> 54:42.080]  it would take a year to two years and I was get on to now they have to reinvade
[54:42.080 --> 54:50.480]  to fight al-Qaeda in Libya put al-Qaeda in direct everything then go fight al-Qaeda
[54:50.480 --> 54:55.760]  and here it is from singing in Libyan official US drones seeking jihadist in
[54:55.760 --> 55:04.560]  Libya just out minutes ago boom another prediction comes true with precision
[55:04.560 --> 55:09.720]  and how does it all come true with precision because it's a blueprint a
[55:09.720 --> 55:14.720]  program it's not west versus east it's the bankers playing us off against each
[55:14.720 --> 55:21.840]  other it's very very sad to see this happening we're like thrown in a cage
[55:21.840 --> 55:28.080]  like two pit bulls or two Gamecocks two roosters which with razor blades on our
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.720]  on our feet and we're supposed to just hack each other up it's just amazing I
[55:33.720 --> 55:37.440]  mean I'm so angry next time I fly and some TSA wants to ask me questions go on
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.200]  I'm gonna say look man I'm not playing your game your chat down your boss is
[55:42.200 --> 55:47.320]  one al-Qaeda who you make me angry and see they know everybody knows that now
[55:47.320 --> 55:51.560]  so they're like it doesn't matter you're you're a right winger or whatever I'm
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.120]  just tired of it man call them on their bluff how much more crazy does this have
[55:56.120 --> 56:03.440]  to get how much more out of control every day I see mainstream news where
[56:03.440 --> 56:09.040]  they're arresting parents whose kids play in even their backyards and when
[56:09.040 --> 56:13.640]  some nanny state tattletale calls the police on you the cops have been told
[56:13.640 --> 56:22.600]  to act like God called my reporters we aired it here on the show yesterday we're
[56:22.600 --> 56:28.160]  out in Austin when we want to know what you think about the TSA you're rolling
[56:28.160 --> 56:31.200]  on the streets and I got a business suits her taking pictures he goes I got
[56:31.200 --> 56:36.600]  somebody for you to talk to and the cops came I mean that's twilight zone you
[56:36.600 --> 56:40.920]  got people in business suits politely out on the street out front of Starbucks
[56:40.920 --> 56:49.000]  and he calls the police on them I mean these people think that's normal they
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.840]  they're ready for roundups they're ready they love it they they love it
[56:52.840 --> 57:01.280]  they're evil it's the opposite of freedom these are crazy people the
[57:01.280 --> 57:05.280]  infraguard teams just type in infraguard it's the top stories on it after the
[57:05.280 --> 57:09.720]  FBI's own website where they admittedly have people trained with firearms
[57:09.720 --> 57:13.680]  hundreds of thousands of executives as their private secret militia with
[57:13.680 --> 57:19.640]  licensed to kill citizens I mean blow our heads off and these people are on
[57:19.640 --> 57:22.960]  such power trips they just can't wait to I'm gonna cook photos even call the
[57:22.960 --> 57:28.240]  cops how dare you talk about TSA hit the streets of America I mean that's how
[57:28.240 --> 57:35.320]  warped this country's gotten it's how evil we are we're in grave danger I haven't

[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:42.120]  turned into the big blockbuster hit Obama 2016 Obama's America we have of
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:48.680]  course the US ambassador to Libya killed dead in the hammer drug around and here
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.240]  is the latest out of CNN just out a few minutes ago US using drones to look for
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:01:01.160]  targets tied to attack US official says looking for jihadist so they put them in
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:05.600]  and then now want to go claim they're gonna kill them they'll probably just
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:10.440]  kill somebody else they want to get rid of and blame it on them but pretty
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:16.400]  amazing to see all of this going on in a marine unit has been dispatched to
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:24.440]  secure consulate in Benghazi after attack so it is definitely it is
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:30.120]  definitely heating up right now we'll be getting to more of that coming up
[01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:38.760]  throughout the broadcast today we will also continue breaking down other
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.360]  news this is something we've been covering a lot now even children in
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:45.880]  your backyard the police are coming and taking you to jail or a mother with her
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:50.880]  children in a cul-de-sac on scooters that you're just not allowed to do that
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.040]  the neighbor called when the neighbor on the snitch calls the police come and
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:57.200]  arrest you if you're an old man cleaning a gun in your backyard in the
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:02:00.920]  country your neighbor sees it from 200 yards away you're going to jail the
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.560]  cops don't care they're like well we better pick up for psychological reasons
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:08.800]  because if a snitch calls we've got to empower that snitch that they're God so
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:11.880]  if you even needs a Supreme Court now you could just have a snitch busy body
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:16.480]  neighbor you know just you know just announce the Sun won't come up in the
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.080]  morning and you know they've got a like send a neutron beam at the Sun to blow
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:23.920]  it up or something because he can't let it come up in the morning of a snitch
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.200]  says it isn't coming up you know we've got to stop it I mean my point is that
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:34.800]  like these snitches are God it's satire folks but what's not satire is mom
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:40.680]  sues police over arrest report Texas stay-at-home mom from the port has followed
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:43.720]  a lawsuit against the city's police department an unknown officer and one
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:47.440]  of her neighbors good Tammy Cooper said she was wrongfully accused of
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.320]  endangering yeah they should charge the neighbor with a false report with the
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:54.640]  cops I mean where's the common sense here Tammy Cooper said she was wrongly
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.120]  accused of endangering her children and was even forced to spend the night in
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:04.000]  jail all because she let her kids play outside in a cul-de-sac in a rural area
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.360]  as she sat in a lawn chair and they dropped the charges but it just shows
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.400]  the insanity now this is a short little segment so I won't go to him now we're
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:16.360]  going to go to break and we've got him to Neshda Suza very excited about this
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:22.240]  interview because as you know a few weeks ago I went and saw the new film by
[01:03:22.240 --> 01:03:28.760]  writer and director 2016 Obama's America and he of course works in the Reagan
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:32.600]  White House well we'll give you his bio when we come back here in just a moment
[01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:37.880]  but it gets into the psychology of why they want to lower the standard of
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.160]  living in the Western world which is an admitted policy when they pushed the
[01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:47.160]  Copenhagen tax three years ago in Denmark when they were over there they
[01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:50.560]  pushed that whole UN program saying we wanted to lower our standard not build
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:55.280]  up the third world they want to block its development as well and it all ties
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.440]  into this whole agenda 21 the whole nine yards so we're going to go to break here
[01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:06.160]  in a moment and come back with Dinesh Suza and again he's in the news today
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:13.880]  Deadline Hollywood is reporting that the 2016 Obama's America filmmaker reacts
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:17.920]  to president slam looking for network to air before election says mainstream
[01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:23.080]  media refusing coverage well I mean if Dinesh Suza just wanted to make money
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.600]  that's probably a good thing is that the theaters are still packed with people
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:29.400]  trying to see it so the fact that they tried to suppress this some of my
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:33.920]  friends were trying to get this to town like a month ago when it was first
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.080]  coming out because none of the theaters would show it and they were having to
[01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:41.120]  pay to bring it to a theater but then that got cancelled because then it
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.800]  became a hit in limited theater so it got there anyway so that was pretty
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.360]  pretty interesting as well just to see how the system does not want you seeing
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:55.400]  this I does not want you seeing that information we'll be right back with

[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:28.120]  Fahrenheit 9-11 it's already made more than two of Michael Moore's other films
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:34.560]  combined twenty six million dollars and it hasn't even hit DVD or Netflix yet
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:38.640]  I'm not gonna waste time going over his link the bio most of you know him
[01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:44.000]  Dinesh DeSousa is the maker and a writer and director and it's based on his
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:51.080]  book 2016 Obama's America that the system fought to even get the theaters I went
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:55.600]  and saw it was very impressed with the quality of the production I disagree with
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:59.280]  a few things in it and we'll get into that with Dinesh DeSousa who joins us
[01:08:59.280 --> 01:09:06.400]  until the bottom of the hour of course he worked in the Reagan White House as a
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:13.520]  World Affairs you know advisor and a policy analyst and he is a best-selling
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:17.440]  author and journalist and he joins us now thank you for coming on the show
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:23.600]  Dinesh. It's a great pleasure to be on. Okay so wow tell us about the huge
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:27.680]  success of the film and where you're going. Well the film has become absolutely huge
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:33.840]  it started in the summer as a small film showing initially a single theater in
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:37.920]  Houston Texas then it went to four theaters expanded out to about a hundred
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:41.640]  but it did so well in those hundred theaters and it jumped to a thousand
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:45.320]  theaters it's now in two thousand theaters so it's pretty much any American
[01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:50.040]  who wants to see the film can find it and on our website which is just 2016 the
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:54.840]  movie.com will allow you to see a trailer and see where it's playing. The film has now
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:58.760]  become a just surpassed two of Michael Moore's films, Sicko and Burling for
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:03.280]  Columbine and also our birth film called An Inconvenient Truth so we are now
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:08.240]  remarkably the second most successful political documentary of our time.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:11.800]  Simply amazing it shows people are desperate for something than the
[01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:17.480]  mainstream PAP they're being fed certainly trailblazing in a big way here
[01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:22.320]  Dinesh the basic thesis for those that don't know is that what Obama is a
[01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:29.120]  global wealth redistributor? Yes you know many people think that Obama is a
[01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:33.800]  wealth redistributor in America and he is so when they talk about the 1% to
[01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:39.080]  99% they think that Obama means in the United States but Obama is a global guy
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:43.480]  I mean remember here's a guy who grew up in part in Indonesia made multiple trips
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:49.120]  to Pakistan to Kenya and so Obama looks at all this from the world point of view
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:55.000]  and I think when he thinks of the 1% to 99% he puts all of America in the 1%
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.720]  and there are 99 hungry nations encircling America all of whom want
[01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:08.000]  America's standard of living, America's wealth, America's power and so on. So Obama is not just recycling money in the United States
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:14.120]  he's also clasping large amounts of wealth from America to the rest of the world.
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.760]  Dinesh I want to get into the fact that you're in the news today talking about
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:27.320]  trying to get your film on television break that down I see deadline Hollywood
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:34.240]  reports exclusive 2016 Obama's America filmmaker reacts to President Slam and
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:37.240]  he's looking for a network to air before elections says mainstream media
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:41.800]  refusing coverage elaborate on that Dinesh well it's been kind of odd that you
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:45.160]  know remember when Michael Moore made his films this guy was everywhere covered
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:50.080]  by the network he was on all the Sunday shows he was covered widely in the
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:54.200]  newspapers and so on our film well for a long time was being ignored by the
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.600]  White House and lots of mainstream outlets just weren't covering it they
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.080]  were just pretending like it didn't exist when a political season this is a
[01:12:01.080 --> 01:12:05.960]  the most successful political documentary of the year by far and yet it was
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:09.880]  getting no coverage at all so this is peculiar and I think part of it was
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:14.520]  there was a sense of this documentary has harmful new information that might
[01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:18.400]  cause people to change their mind about Obama so let's not cover it and let's
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:22.120]  pretend it doesn't exist now the White House has figured out the day like this
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:25.840]  has gotten too big we can't ignore it it's everywhere so they've come out
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:31.040]  blasting it but you know what a clumsy inept blast it is because they're
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:34.200]  alleging all these areas in the film that are actually not only are they not
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:38.760]  errors but they're easily provable and so I'm very happy to get into this one on
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.080]  one debate with Barack Obama I know it's not it's a debate that I'm not worried
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:50.480]  that I'm going to lose now continuing here with the success of the film do you
[01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:54.360]  think it is having a major bearing on the election or could it be could it be
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:59.440]  something that actually causes you know people to wake up to what Obama's doing
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:12.760]  and swing the election over to Romney the American dream and in the film we
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:17.520]  contrast two dreams the American dream and Obama's dream you know I'm an
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.080]  immigrant I grew up in India and so my dream is the American dream I you know I
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:26.800]  believe in a society of merit a society of which three markets generate wealth
[01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:31.440]  America's a force for good and for freedom in the world that's my American
[01:13:31.440 --> 01:13:35.400]  dream well Obama has a different dream and it's a dream from his father that's
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:39.760]  the title of his autobiography and so in the film we go and find out who is his
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.560]  father what was his father's dream and it turns out to be a third-world dream in
[01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:48.280]  some ways an anti-American dream certainly it's a dream of reducing
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.240]  America's influence in the world treating America if you will as a rogue
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:58.560]  nation so in some ways it is true that Obama holds these ideas but they're
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:02.800]  right over Obama they're in fact believed by many people in Riyadh and
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:06.560]  Jakarta and Rio de Janeiro it's just that we've never had a president of the
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:11.920]  United States who holds these views now we have the maker the author the
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:19.280]  director you name it of the new hit documentary Dinesh D'Souza 2016 Obama's
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.560]  America on with us here's my issue I've studied history as you have and you
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.800]  could undoubtedly say until the 50s and 60s the United States certainly wasn't
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:32.560]  perfect did have a policy to actually try to build up the third world and
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.000]  really empower them and bring them freedom since then a perfect example
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.760]  putting radicals the hottest in Libya putting them in Syria they've now killed
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:48.760]  the US ambassador in Libya and NATO's funding this this is bigger than just
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:54.960]  Obama and your film you show the Middle East spreading out into you know areas
[01:14:54.960 --> 01:15:00.240]  of Central Asia up into Russia Western Europe you know a new jihad similar what
[01:15:00.240 --> 01:15:04.880]  we saw triggering the Crusades we see this you know Islam spreading like like
[01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:10.360]  like like Mordor or something in Lord of the Rings a similar map but then we're
[01:15:10.360 --> 01:15:15.080]  told that's what Obama wants well wait a minute I mean the big megabanks funding
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.200]  Obama the same ones that are funding Mitt Romney to thatch they are the ones
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:24.380]  going with this policy so my issue is this is a lot bigger than Obama well it
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:28.760]  is bigger than Obama I agree and you know in some ways we've got to be fair
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:34.000]  Obama didn't pass the Arab Spring there was an end it reversed within the Arab
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:39.320]  world my criticism of Obama is the way that he's reacting or responding to it
[01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:43.000]  I mean look there's a power struggle going on in Egypt right now it's between
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:47.560]  the military and between the Muslim Brotherhood the Muslim Brotherhood is
[01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:51.160]  the largest organization of radical Islam in the world
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:55.480]  so whose side is Obama on he's on the side of the Muslim Brotherhood but the
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.240]  Obama administration has been warning the Egyptian military you guys better
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:05.440]  turn over power or we're gonna cut off USA now wow here's the United States we
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:10.200]  had an Egypt an ally Mubarak a dictator to be sure but a dictator friendly to
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:14.760]  Israel friendly to the United States we have to push him out and now we're
[01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:19.840]  accelerating a transition of power so that our own deadly enemies there were
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:23.880]  the radical Muslims get a hold of a major country but the radical Muslims
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.040]  already controlled Iran if they now control Egypt there's only one other
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:32.200]  big country left for them to take over and that's Saudi Arabia so that's where
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.640]  the film goes it says wait a minute you know Saudi Arabia falls then all the
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.280]  major legs of the tripod are now in place and all the smaller countries Jordan
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.920]  Bahrain the United Arab Emirates and so on they're never going to be able to
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:49.760]  hold out against a tide of radical Islam sweeping the region so you know
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:53.640]  what's going on with Obama I mean some people think Obama's a bungler he
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:57.560]  doesn't know what he's doing and so on I say no I think Obama knows what's
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.560]  happening it's very predictable you could be happening right in front of our
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.760]  eyes but Obama is trying to reduce the US influence in the region and part of
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:09.240]  that is to weaken our allies and allow some of the bad guys to come to power
[01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:15.440]  well Dinesh let me ask you this question I mean clearly a lot of Obama's
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:20.280]  family has CIA ties and connections when we hear that you know he's a radical
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:25.520]  Muslim who wants to overthrow us I mean I think that is just a propaganda I
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:28.520]  know you're not saying that you're saying he's kind of a world citizen a
[01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:33.200]  globalist he wants to diminish American power I agree but not to give it to the
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.120]  Muslims they're just going to use those guys the radical Muslims to
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:41.000]  destabilize this is more of a British great game speaking of colonialism and
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:45.200]  I see the mega corporations that brag that they've conquered Europe through
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:48.880]  derivatives fraud and conquered us I mean I can play the clips to see NBC
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:52.960]  shame though the world's been conquered by private banks who aren't free market
[01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:58.160]  and I see them always waging war against sovereignty and actually the old
[01:17:58.160 --> 01:18:03.640]  colonialism so I see Obama not even as anti-colonialist he is siding with
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:09.440]  globalism that is a modern corporate colonialism that actually teams up with
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:14.960]  the third world not to empower them but to leverage out the first world look at
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.280]  the example of the globalist teaming up with China now now I mean I know that's
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.080]  a complex issue but I know you know what I'm talking about well I do think that
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:26.760]  there is an alliance between a guy like Obama I think a guy like George Soros who
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:29.240]  has his own global agenda
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:32.760]  for Obama in my opinion are not coming from the same place
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:38.800]  for the european disdain for America he uses financial leverage I think he would
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:43.440]  love to try to pull America down Obama has a third world ideology this is the
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.400]  anti-colonial part for Obama and Soros are coming from different places but in
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:52.160]  a way they have a common project and the common project is to level down the power
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.240]  of the United States well that's actually true then and what you're saying is true
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:59.760]  well sure I mean Soros openly says he's wanted to kill the dollar forever
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.920]  he's wanted to get rid of our liberties forever he isn't admitted you know as a
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:09.160]  young man a Nazi helper and sympathizer how is this monster allowed to operate
[01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:14.120]  inside of our country and run groups like media matters his memos have come
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:18.880]  out wanting to destroy alternative media these are authoritarians so how did the
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.400]  power structure who's not far from perfect but how did they let somebody
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:27.920]  like Obama get in who does want to destroy our sovereignty who would pay
[01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:35.560]  $22 billion to ship General Motors of Volt and Cadillac factories Dinesh to
[01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:39.880]  China I mean he really does want to destroy this country I think he wants
[01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.960]  to downsize it I mean I would stay away from the word destroy myself but I'm
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:47.760]  just trying to be as cautious as I can and making the case so that it really
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:51.880]  sticks and is anchored on the facts I mean there's no question Obama will give
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:56.760]  defense contracts to Brazilians over American companies which is a very hard
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:00.840]  thing to do when it comes to defense every country wants to have its defense
[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:06.040]  contracts within the country but not apparently Obama will basically say
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:10.360]  that American companies that advertised by American are being quote
[01:20:10.360 --> 01:20:15.480]  discriminatory and so in the in trade deals that he makes in the Far East he
[01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:19.440]  says well we're going to try to exclude those kinds of companies that are being
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:25.600]  quote discriminatory discriminatory how advertising by American look this is a
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:30.160]  very unusual guy that we have in the herbal office he's not Bill Clinton I
[01:20:30.160 --> 01:20:34.280]  think we've already figured that out but he's not even Jimmy Carter Jimmy Carter
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.760]  made a lot of mistakes but he made mistakes because he was a buffoon he was
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:42.160]  incompetent Obama's mistakes aren't like that it isn't that Obama's getting
[01:20:42.160 --> 01:20:46.640]  results opposite to what he intends he intends the results he's getting
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:52.240]  Dinesh DeSousa maker of the second biggest political documentary in all
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:55.640]  time 26 million gross in a month it's gonna be the theaters other month and a
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:21:00.160]  half then go to DVD look I think your film is a masterpiece I mean it's
[01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:03.920]  cinematic leave the style I'm a filmmaker myself the Obama deception is
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:07.640]  free online for folks that want to watch that I mean I was impressed with what
[01:21:07.640 --> 01:21:11.640]  you brought to the table because most political documentaries are at about a
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:15.360]  fourth grade level and and I'm not insulting your film but yours is it you
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:20.280]  know at a eighth grade tenth grade level and I guess in media they say keep it
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:25.960]  about a fourth grade level but I mean you actually tackle issues of globalism
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.440]  that well there's one point in the film if I'm wrong where you say and and show
[01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:34.200]  the evidence that it's not that they want to build up the third world they
[01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:39.160]  want to bring us down to that level and that's a big deal yeah with Obama it's
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:42.680]  not about to building up I mean he's actually rarely even talks that much
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:46.640]  about the inner city or about the poor he gets excited when he's pulling down
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:51.800]  the rich that's his target and that's when when you begin to see Obama's you
[01:21:51.800 --> 01:21:56.320]  know his voice rises and he gets animated and so on so ultimately this is
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:22:01.640]  about leveling down I agree and it also but not just wealth he's also leveling
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:06.000]  American power I think he doesn't like a world in which one country America is
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.560]  the soul superpower he'd like to see Russia come up China come up India come
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.640]  up Brazil come up he wants to see a multi-polar world in which there are
[01:22:14.640 --> 01:22:18.600]  many countries sharing power and by the way many countries that have a roughly
[01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:23.040]  equal number of nuclear weapons that's why he's spending less time trying to
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:27.040]  prevent Iran from getting a nuclear bomb and more time trying to flash the
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:30.800]  American nuclear I know let me say this to you I mean obviously you've worked
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.320]  inside the Republican White House of Ronald Reagan I think it's fair to say
[01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:37.560]  you're a Republican operative
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.720]  that's not fair to say I mean I worked in the Reagan White House in my mid-20s I
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:45.560]  mean I'm 51 years old in the president of a college so I just want to say I'm
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:49.840]  I'm a conservative but I mean I have nothing to do with Romney or the RNC
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.800]  okay well the now that you've said that I respect that and again I haven't gone
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:57.480]  over your lengthy bio because of the time but you're obviously a scholar as
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:02.960]  well here's the bottom line Romney is the worst Republican I have ever seen
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:06.920]  obviously I don't have to list everything when he was actually a governor
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:13.640]  abortion open borders restrictions of guns carbon taxes wrote the Obama plan
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:19.760]  I mean all of this my issue is that I want Obama out of there I don't want him
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:24.280]  to not be facing a reelection I mean even if Romney's gonna be bad at least
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:28.680]  he'll be facing a reelection so I am saying okay I see people that want to
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:33.560]  support Romney my issue is this what will you do if Romney gets in and
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:38.360]  continues what some of these monopoly capitalists want that have been financing
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:42.480]  Obama who want tyranny not liberty who don't want a free market what are you
[01:23:42.480 --> 01:23:48.680]  gonna do to Mitt Romney if he gets in and continues what Obama's been doing
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:57.480]  I don't know about Romney as you know we don't mention Romney in the film this
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:01.560]  really is a referendum I think this election is a referendum on Obama if I
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.760]  have to say what the selection is about I don't even say it's about Obama versus
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:09.600]  Obama right there's the very late Obama the the mythical Obama that was put out
[01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:14.600]  in 2008 the unifier the healer the centrist I claim that Obama does not
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.800]  exist and then there's a lot of power the guy in the right house the guy who can't
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:22.840]  change the guy who can't move to the center the guy who has been affirmed in
[01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:27.640]  his mind by a combination of radicals revolutionaries in one case a former
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:32.200]  communist and domestic terrorist bill ares I mean these were his buddies these
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:36.840]  are the guys this is a real Obama so it's a matter of does America want wow so
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:40.560]  you're saying you're saying all the communist pornographers and weirdos
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:45.240]  that he lived with and was associated with you're saying that wasn't just his
[01:24:45.240 --> 01:24:52.600]  foundation cover as a leftist you're saying he really is a real globalist
[01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:59.240]  Marxist-Leninist deindustrializing crazy man well here's what I'm saying if you
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:02.800]  know Frank Marshall Davis was introduced to him by his grandfather so all right
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:06.520]  I'll say that that was somebody that's that his grandfather brought him in
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.960]  front of and he was only ten years old when he met Frank Marshall Davis but
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:14.920]  every other guy the Palestinian radical Edward Said the Brazilian socialist
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.840]  hunger at Harvard last school Bill Ayers the incendiary preacher Jeremiah
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:24.000]  right I mean Obama didn't bump into these guys he slapped them out no
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:28.320]  understand out because he wanted to hang around radical revolutionary guys who
[01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:33.360]  he imagined to be so good father's kind of like his real dad who was around let
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:37.800]  me raise this in the five minutes we've got left with a Dinesh to Susie here the
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.880]  maker of 2016 Obama's America which is an amazing film Dinesh looking at this
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:47.800]  then if he's as bad as you say and I think the evidence is there the fast
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:51.400]  and furious a false flag against the Second Amendment the list goes on and
[01:25:51.400 --> 01:25:56.600]  on we've got all these Obama advisors in the financial times of London you name
[01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:01.360]  it saying don't worry if he's down in the polls they'll be an event we're gonna
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:05.120]  blame on their enemies they don't say they're going to stage it but they they
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:08.520]  imply don't worry something's coming I'm sure you've seen that in the news
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:11.960]  because it's been pushed for two years are you concerned he could pull an
[01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:20.040]  October surprise that's a possibility what I really do in the film and my
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:24.200]  work is I don't even need to go there I don't even need to speculate about what
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.080]  he could do I'm just going to look at what he has done and I'm going to
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.280]  extrapolate out what happens if he just keeps doing that over the next four
[01:26:33.280 --> 01:26:37.480]  years so he's added five trillion dollars in debt let's say he has another five
[01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.680]  trillion a very cautious and reasonable estimate then America will be 20
[01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.880]  trillion dollars in debt and 10 trillion of that will have been added by one man
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:50.200]  Obama and I said wait a minute why would one guy want to do that why would
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:55.040]  someone want to settle his country with almost unrepayable debt and then I
[01:26:55.040 --> 01:26:59.840]  offer a theory I said well maybe he sees a debt as a way to settle America's
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:03.640]  colonial debt it's kind of like we are the rest of the world I can't get a
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:07.240]  foreign aid program passed so we're trying for trillions of dollars in wealth
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:11.200]  but I can achieve the same effect because if our children and grandchildren
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:15.240]  have to pay back all this debt and some of that debt is owed to Canadians and
[01:27:15.240 --> 01:27:19.120]  Saudis and the Chinese well that's another way to transfer larger
[01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:24.960]  trillions of dollars outside the United States to all these other countries but
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:29.080]  again I go back to the issue Goldman Sachs JP Morgan I mean you look at the
[01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:33.000]  list of people that are not just supporting Obama they supported all of
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:37.360]  his policies they they are financing everything he wants I'm saying these
[01:27:37.360 --> 01:27:43.280]  globalist we need conservatives and libertarians to to recognize that there
[01:27:43.280 --> 01:27:46.400]  are two different groups of capitalists they're the free market capitalist
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:51.720]  there are the monopoly capitalist who want tyranny who don't want freedom who
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:55.520]  don't want us to have choice who are working through big government types
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:59.760]  like Obama to convert us to an authoritarian system that's all I'm
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:03.520]  saying is that all this all this corruption and globalism didn't just
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:08.280]  start with Obama yes I agree with that and then they even as I mentioned that
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:12.680]  well you know you're well aware I'm well aware that Reagan added 200 billion
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:17.080]  dollars a year and that Bush of course was a big spender he Bush's largest
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:20.480]  deficit was half a trillion but again keep things in perspective
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:25.000]  Obama's smallest deficit is more than double that it's a trillion
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:29.840]  dollars and so I think what Obama has done is just lift things to a sort of
[01:28:29.840 --> 01:28:36.560]  complete and unacceptable new level I hear you I hear you it just it just makes
[01:28:36.560 --> 01:28:41.360]  me so upset to see this country and the TSA sticking their hands down our pants
[01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:46.520]  looking for bin Laden while NATO our own government is putting al-Qaeda in as the
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:53.120]  main shock force in Libya and Syria it's just it's so scary to see what both
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:58.720]  parties have become the torture of the secret arrest the wars all of it and I
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:01.800]  cover all that in the Obama deception I made it three and a half years ago it's
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:09.720]  it's all come true unfortunately Dinesh have you seen the Obama deception all
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:13.520]  right we're gonna go to break here and I'll talk to you as we go to break and
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.800]  as you leave us and then I'll find a PO box or something to to send the film to
[01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:20.720]  you because I mean I get it Obama is really bad but I think he's a
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:25.400]  manifestation of how far along this globalist line we've gotten do you think
[01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:30.000]  Obama in closing made backfire on the establishment and may cause a pendulum
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:38.160]  swing back towards liberty I mean I I hope that people are using this sort of
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:42.800]  intense interest in politics it'll be generated this year to think about what
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:46.520]  happened to the American dream and you know is this American era which began in
[01:29:46.520 --> 01:29:51.640]  1945 we never even got into you didn't build that we're on the march the
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:58.760]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:10.400 --> 01:33:17.440]  you are listening to an infowars.com frontline report if you are receiving
[01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:30.880]  this transmission you are the resistance because normally a Republican
[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:35.200]  type but he is the head of a major university as well you know would just
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:38.560]  sit there and go to talking points and wouldn't admit what I was saying was
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.480]  accurate but you know he basically responded you heard him he basically
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:47.360]  responded and said look I'm just focusing on what I can prove and a basic
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:51.640]  message so Obama doesn't get reelected and it's the honesty that I appreciated
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:58.160]  from him as an author and as a filmmaker so again and I wasn't trying to insult
[01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.040]  him I said most films are at a fourth grade level yours is in an eighth grade
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:05.000]  level and I wasn't trying to be arrogant he pretty much admitted that he goes
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.640]  yeah I'm just trying to get some basic facts across because they say in
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.160]  politics dumb it down and that's why we've gotten to this place is it's a
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:17.440]  feedback loop where people don't understand basic facts to the point of
[01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:23.400]  they can have al-Qaeda openly being put in by Western governments while we're
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:28.000]  told give our rights up because al-Qaeda is going to get us it doesn't fly I want
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:32.840]  my freedom back I don't want feds on the streets running checkpoints who aren't
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:38.080]  even sworn officers be bad enough if it was real police I mean our republic is
[01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:41.960]  in trouble and by the way I'm not envious of people when they have a big
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:46.200]  hit film I say more power to them great trailblazing that's something I've
[01:34:46.200 --> 01:34:49.480]  always intended to try to do and we will do it in the future so I haven't had a
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:52.800]  made a film over a year myself this because I've been busy getting the TV
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:34:56.760]  ready I've always intended to develop the subscription based system for five
[01:34:56.760 --> 01:35:01.760]  years and then put it on television back's now doing that I understand the
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:05.960]  internet revolution because I grew up through it and that's why we've been on
[01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:09.880]  the cutting edge and so I'm I'm glad for their film and I'm glad it's doing
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:15.200]  well I want the Obama deception that's free online and been seen more than 40
[01:35:15.200 --> 01:35:21.120]  million times to be seen it's free on Google and YouTube and all over I want
[01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:27.040]  you to get the DVD with expanded extras at info wars store.com so you can have
[01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:30.640]  a record of it because they can erase it off YouTube or Google I want you to give
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:35.440]  copies to people because this film exposes that they would then get rid of
[01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:39.000]  Obama and bring in a new globalist puppet but that they would have him in
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:43.680]  there to blame it on leftist you know to act like oh it was just Obama that was
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:49.400]  doing it not the power structure itself and that's what the Obama deception
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:55.560]  basically explains and that's why it's so important so info wars store.com
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:36:00.400]  get the Obama deception, proprio, water filters, 10% off their best crowd

[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:34.000]  level and it's up at info wars.com right now Congress smacks down the TSA
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:38.800]  orders agency to reduce pat downs they've done this before though they're not
[01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:41.680]  going to stop they grow up every good-looking woman and every child
[01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:45.360]  because that's what they're into orders agencies to reduce pat downs use
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:50.800]  private security screeners and address scanner health see that's the problem the
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:58.000]  TSA this Republican plan is not good now goes out and they certify not just
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  private security people but they go out and they certify the police now so this
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  untrained out of control out of their jurisdiction not even sworn officers they
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:14.560]  wave a magic homeland security executive order wand well you saw cases of
[01:37:14.560 --> 01:37:21.320]  groping at high school proms in places like New Mexico Santa Fe last year and
[01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.440]  the federal judge said okay just have TSA there to train you and then it's okay
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:29.640]  then you can stick your hands down jenny's pants or billy's pants I mean
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:33.920]  this is so crazy so we're running out of the jaws of the TSA into private
[01:37:33.920 --> 01:37:37.720]  screeners they'll do the same thing they're also saying oh trusted travelers
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:43.880]  will wear a bracelet now that is only one step away from what homeland security
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.880]  looked at four years ago all of us wearing taser bracelets yes you heard
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:50.600]  me right you're like that'll never happen oh really there are resting mothers
[01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:54.280]  nationwide for children playing in their front yards or backyards or in the

[01:37:58.080 --> 01:38:02.080]  to 7-eleven they're arresting I mean they're putting cameras in bathrooms
[01:38:02.080 --> 01:38:05.960]  everywhere at public schools I have that the news today in the US and in
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:10.840]  England mothers who breastfeed they're calling the police on when a woman at
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:15.560]  the mall sits down and covers herself up big deal they're making our normal
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:20.680]  bodies and being human bad the nanny state is a giant reeducation camp take

[01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:43.200]  been caught lying about the radiation dangers lying and saying it's safe and
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:46.480]  saying they have reports by John Hopkins and it turns out John Hopkins

[01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:34.880]  Obama launches a new supermarket shopping guide but no mention of GMO
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:40.880]  aspartame MSG gluten anything like that just oh you're getting unhealthy so the
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.000]  government needs to take over and meanwhile I was talking to a man a long
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:48.960]  storm on the other night and he also told me how he just been in South Korea
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:53.960]  and I wouldn't look this up you can't even get an aspirin or vitamins at the
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:59.520]  store you have to go to a pharmacy and pay pharmacy rates for vitamin E hundreds
[01:39:59.520 --> 01:40:03.960]  of dollars if you convert it to US money instead of $10 for some vitamin E this
[01:40:03.960 --> 01:40:08.360]  is what Europe's passing with Codex Alimentarius and joining us to break
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:13.780]  that down by back by popular demand is Dr. Joel Wallach he's published
[01:40:13.780 --> 01:40:18.160]  numerous books on dietary deficiencies conducts approximately 300 lectures
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:22.200]  annually he had 25 million dollars of government funding as a top zoologist
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:27.640]  he's got multiple medical degrees but his first one is as a veterinary medicine
[01:40:27.640 --> 01:40:31.960]  and he discovered that a lot of different diseases were mineral based or
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:36.280]  vitamin based well just like scurvy's vitamin C missing a lot of adults have
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:40.760]  scurvy now the doctors won't even tell you so we're gonna be breaking that down
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:45.160]  with him in that attack and we've got somebody who I'm a big fan of Theo
[01:40:45.160 --> 01:40:49.240]  Ratliff is an American former professional basketball player who last
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.880]  played with the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers primarily a sinner he was an
[01:40:52.880 --> 01:40:57.280]  excellent shot blocker who has led the league three times in blocks per game
[01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:03.160]  wow league leader as of 2011 he has ranked 18th all-time in career blocks
[01:41:03.160 --> 01:41:08.080]  and 13th all-time in career blocks per game a Ratliff played basketball at
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:11.240]  Dolphin's High School and later graduated University of Wyoming he's also the
[01:41:11.240 --> 01:41:17.440]  owner of Rome Gladiators and he is on with us he is the maker well I mean
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:22.480]  he's endorsing as a proprietary blend for him of rebound that I take and for
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:27.040]  people watching on prison planet dot TV here you can I'm actually on some
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:33.000]  rebound right now an amazing energy stand on a sports drink that is just off the
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:36.200]  charts and so there it is right over there on the document cam shot they
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:41.600]  can show people the rebound FX and they've got it in different flavors right
[01:41:41.600 --> 01:41:46.080]  there they've got what berry boost and citrus punch I personally like the
[01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:49.520]  berry boost the most just like I like polymers plus this berry I just like
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:53.480]  berry better than citrus but to each their own and it's all available I
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:58.840]  should add as well at info wars health calm so we're also engaged in good
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:01.960]  old-fashioned capitalism here because I I searched out the best vitamin and
[01:42:01.960 --> 01:42:06.120]  minerals for myself Aaron lost 92 pounds on it as you know and I found
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:10.200]  longevity and the testimonials just pour in so they're both here to talk
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:14.600]  about that we're going to Theo here in a moment but let's bring up Dr. Wallach
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:19.180]  Joel Wallach tell us about Theo Ratliff and then we'll get his his
[01:42:19.180 --> 01:42:24.160]  testimony here and talk about the amazing product rebound that he you know
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:28.320]  basically envisioned out of the other young Jebedee products because of the
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:32.800]  response he got well thank you Alex it's always good to be with you first of
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:40.480]  all and then Theo is a great American he's a great role model for young people
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:45.240]  who want to be healthy and yet to play sports and Theo's career was over I don't
[01:42:45.240 --> 01:42:50.520]  know 10 12 years ago whatever it is he had only to 28 years old I was playing
[01:42:50.520 --> 01:42:54.240]  for the Atlanta Hawks had bone-to-bone arthritis in both knees
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:59.480]  Carleage popped off his right hip had to have it surgically stapled back down
[01:42:59.480 --> 01:43:03.800]  caught a pass during a game and actually fractured his wrist and the
[01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:08.400]  arthritic surgeons at the Atlanta Hawks refused to sign off on it said hey this
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:12.840]  guy's too fragile to play professional ball and a mutual friend introduced us a
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:16.960]  government name of Mike Glenn who's a ESPN moderator played for the Atlanta
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:21.800]  Hawks for 10 years himself used to be called the Stinger introduced Theo to
[01:43:21.800 --> 01:43:26.360]  the young Jebedee program and we got Theo going on the essentially what is
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:31.960]  today the healthy start pack for his body weighs a big fella and he's on the
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:37.360]  healthy start pack plus our gluca gel to rebuild his cartilage and within 90 days
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:41.880]  we had him rebuilt he was able to go back and get his position back he's been
[01:43:41.880 --> 01:43:48.560]  playing ever since essentially free of any breakdown because he's been taking
[01:43:48.560 --> 01:43:51.920]  not only the 90 cents of nutrients regularly just to maintain himself but
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:56.280]  also the rebound which we designed for him it has a hundred nutrients in it to
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:00.200]  replace everything you're sweating out Gatorade only has two water has none and
[01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:04.440]  when you sweat Alex you're not sweating out water you're sweating out a soup of
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.520]  all the nutrients you have floating around your blood you have a perfect
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:10.240]  diet you're getting 90 essential nutrients you're sweating out 90
[01:44:10.240 --> 01:44:15.560]  nutrients most people don't they have anywhere from 60 to 70 nutrients that
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.640]  float around their blood they sweat them out and then you drink Gatorade you're
[01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:21.560]  only getting to replace it and that's why people break down in their joints they
[01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:24.840]  break down in their muscles they have a heart attack to get diabetes they died
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:32.160]  25 years early amazing let's bring him up on the air Theo Ratliff to break this
[01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:37.400]  down Theo thanks for joining us today oh great that great to be here man and

[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:58.200]  putting out that knowledge and letting people know what the real deal is as
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:02.440]  far as with these minerals in their health describe what happened to you I
[01:45:02.440 --> 01:45:06.720]  mean he just encapsulated but take your time I mean because I was reading in
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:10.080]  sports Madison until recently they never even really discussed the need a full
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.560]  spectrum of vitamins and minerals and then of course you guys sweat more than
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:17.560]  anybody and probably any other sport I mean because it's so aerobic break down
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:23.080]  your story well I mean I've been a guy that always took care of his body you
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:29.200]  know when I was younger got proper rest ate proper foods did all the right
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:35.040]  things and probably mine it was my second year in the league going to my
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:40.680]  third year I bang these with somebody end up having it go through a
[01:45:40.680 --> 01:45:44.120]  microfracture surgery play I had to play the year throughout with a
[01:45:44.120 --> 01:45:48.040]  microfracture surgery you know when you get the microfracture you know you get a
[01:45:48.040 --> 01:45:53.720]  lot of swelling a constant swelling even after you're done even after you
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.640]  have the surgery so I was going through constantly swelling was able to play
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:03.400]  through it low in the hole ended up going to Philadelphia playing with
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:07.920]  Philadelphia starting really making a name for myself leading the leagues in
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:13.480]  blocks and just playing well you know body was still kind of breaking down at
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:20.440]  the same time but I was able to fight through it but I'm home about my fourth
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:28.960]  year fifth year in the league in 2001 I ended up being you know one of the top
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:33.960]  defensive guys in the league at the time I think we had the best record in the
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:38.320]  league at the time before the all-star break and probably two three games
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:43.880]  before the all-star game I went up to block the shot on I think was dirt
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:49.360]  dirt in the whiskey in Dallas and I came down on my wrist trying to just catch
[01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:57.720]  myself a routine in a fracturing my wrist so wasn't able to play you know one
[01:46:57.720 --> 01:47:02.040]  of the top centers in the league at the time so during that time we have what
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:06.160]  we call a trade that line so because I wasn't able to play and wasn't able
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:12.040]  to perform at that time I ended up getting traded for the Kimberley Mutombo
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:18.040]  from Atlanta to Philly and I ended up going to Atlanta so didn't play the
[01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:23.640]  rest of the year just rehab hit my hand back and then during the summertime
[01:47:23.640 --> 01:47:28.080]  after I was healthy and everything I just went up this could have been no more
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:32.640]  than two or three days when I started playing again I just went up and jumped
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:38.640]  for a routine ball and I end up tearing the leg room in my hip so I had to set
[01:47:38.640 --> 01:47:44.400]  out again so it went through surgery went through that surgery try to get the
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:49.600]  body back together but it just wasn't working out I thought after six years it
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:54.160]  looked like I was just heading for retirement so let me know I heard Mike
[01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:59.320]  Glenn who's our commentator was Dr. Wellick said we're speaking to another
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:05.680]  gentleman on the team about minerals and mineral deficiencies and calcium and
[01:48:05.680 --> 01:48:08.800]  different things that nature and talking about the different diseases and I
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:13.600]  was like and is that what's been going on with me so I'll pull him over to the
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:19.120]  side and I told him look man you got to break these minerals down to me break
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.920]  this thing down because I know I've done everything possible to try to stay in
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:27.680]  his league and and build my body up and do all the right things but my body's
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:32.280]  just breaking down on me it's like my bones are getting brittle so he sat me
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:36.040]  down along with the guy named Phil Oliver and they explained to me about the
[01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:41.320]  calcium deficiency the different disease you get from calcium but one of the
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:46.160]  biggest things that they told me about was athletes don't live alone I mean
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:51.280]  after when athletes die when athletes finish playing they have an average
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:57.640]  lifespan of probably 55 look at Will Chamberlain look at all these guys right
[01:48:57.640 --> 01:49:03.800]  and you see it just from how guys pass away you know constantly and throughout
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:10.000]  the retired ranks so they and they kind of explained to me about you you're
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:13.560]  losing your minerals you know you've been doing it all your life you don't
[01:49:13.560 --> 01:49:17.720]  know what all you do is taste the salt in the minerals because that's what you
[01:49:17.720 --> 01:49:21.720]  familiar with but at the same time you're losing not any different minerals
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:26.720]  that are coming out your body as you sweat and I was amazed you know when
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:32.120]  they was telling me this like man could this be to be what the situation is and
[01:49:32.120 --> 01:49:36.120]  then Dr. Wiley explained to me about going Carly's back and I'm telling them
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:41.160]  about my knees my knees swelling up every time I run and the hip and all this
[01:49:41.160 --> 01:49:47.120]  stuff and you know it was it was to the point where you know I was always a
[01:49:47.120 --> 01:49:51.440]  great listener but when they start saying the things that they were saying
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:57.240]  me being from Alabama and thinking about a lot of old remedies that grandma
[01:49:57.240 --> 01:50:02.280]  used to use it made sense to me well yeah grandma used to grind up bone to put
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:06.120]  it in the bread and grandma used to you know tell people they need to eat clay
[01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:10.080]  and things and I mean you see the deer out doing it I mean I was watching the
[01:50:10.080 --> 01:50:13.840]  show last night showed elephants sticking their drunks way down into the mud to
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:19.160]  get minerals I mean animals know this why why have we forgotten this right
[01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:24.960]  right right so when he when he told me about that the the gelatin and being
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:30.120]  able to recreate Carly's and build your body back with the minerals and different
[01:50:30.120 --> 01:50:34.520]  things that nature I got on it diligently I did not stop taking I still to
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:38.840]  this day I wake up and I take my minerals every single day you know like
[01:50:38.840 --> 01:50:43.520]  clockwork you know it when once they explained to me it's like food it's not
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:49.760]  amount of a matter of what you consume as far as the amount but it's because it's
[01:50:49.760 --> 01:50:54.240]  like food is natural and it's a plant-derived mineral so it absorbs in
[01:50:54.240 --> 01:50:59.080]  your body you know 100% and and when you hear something like that you kind of
[01:50:59.080 --> 01:51:04.040]  throw up a red flag but as you do your research and you learn about plants and
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:08.800]  how how they're working how they function in your body you you tend to
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:13.080]  understand so I got on the program diligently and was just all out with the
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:18.680]  program and was able to build my body back and went on to lead the league and
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:23.480]  blocks that year was up for defensive player the year at the same time for the
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:29.080]  next two years and you know went on to Portland transfer to Portland and was
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:34.000]  able to sign a big contract and during that time because I was so diligent
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:41.520]  on the program they created this rebound FX to keep me sustained throughout the
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:47.880]  game as far as with the energy you know that I need when guys are dying in that
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:52.320]  fourth quarter and they see my motor is filled up at a hundred percent it gave
[01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:55.800]  me an advantage so you know this product has been great for me so
[01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:59.120]  especially formulated off what they thought you would need for long distance
[01:51:59.120 --> 01:52:02.960]  stamina now now break down because I've seen you on the news talk about this
[01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:07.000]  what started happening is everything was starting to degenerate breaking under
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:10.480]  this whole life of stress and intense sports as you were depleting your
[01:52:10.480 --> 01:52:14.360]  minerals and vitamins and things were starting to break down I mean how fast
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:19.960]  did you see a response when you started taking basically the healthy start pack
[01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:25.400]  and the glycogel and other things I mean what was the response you saw Thea one
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:29.160]  is like a shock to the system because you're getting something that you your
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:34.520]  body been craving your whole life so once you once you start taking it you
[01:52:34.520 --> 01:52:40.080]  get energized you get rejuvenated yeah yeah it's like a whole light bulb goes
[01:52:40.080 --> 01:52:43.360]  off well that's my problem is I've gotten more aggressive actually I've got to
[01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:46.560]  be honest you know the side effect of taking all these vitamins and minerals
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:51.280]  is I was I feel aggressive like when I was 20 right right you feel young
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:56.640]  energetic most of us get strong everything so so it's you know that that
[01:52:56.640 --> 01:53:01.400]  said you know when when it when it's when I first started taking it you know
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:08.040]  within a month I felt I felt my body being different you know it takes a lot
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:14.360]  longer because I had the injuries already pre-existing stuff so as I
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:19.280]  continued to take and was able to do a little bit more and started not to see
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:23.160]  and that's swelling in the knees and in the joints and and not having the ice
[01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:28.760]  down and doing all this different stuff then it was like okay I'm getting back
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:34.280]  to myself I'm getting back to that 25 20-year-old you know Theo rally where I
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:38.200]  can I can jump and do all the things that I need to do out on the floor
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:44.680]  comfortably you know so nothing less than miraculous and show me you do me in
[01:53:44.680 --> 01:53:49.880]  your own words you basically owe it to young Jebedy you've said and discovering
[01:53:49.880 --> 01:53:54.720]  this you got how many more years in the league 11 oh man it was yeah it was it
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:54:02.480]  was at least our 10 so so like I I try to tell guys all the time and try to
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:07.720]  introduce them to the product that you know you need to you need to learn what
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:12.680]  what what what you're depleting out of your body you know everybody wants to go
[01:54:12.680 --> 01:54:17.480]  to the to the drugs and and doing the surgery and different stuff like that
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:22.360]  but you're not if you're not attacking what's causing the problems then I mean
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:26.200]  you're defeating the purpose exactly breast cancer is exploding it's always
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:30.000]  fine the cure how about we find out why it's exploding you know same thing with
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.840]  sports why does so many marathon runners end up having heart attacks later
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:37.520]  well it turns out they've depleted all their minerals as Doc Wall it was saying
[01:54:37.520 --> 01:54:42.400]  Gatorade and stuff they push he's got like two or three minerals in it this is
[01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:46.520]  got you know 90 the mighty 90 minerals and vitamins it's just incredible the

[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:14.600]  telling me this is great and I've never been a vitamin or mineral taker I've
[01:55:14.600 --> 01:55:18.280]  gotten like 70 pounds overweight that's embarrassing to say talk radio got and
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:23.320]  worked out in years I turn it I've lost 40 something pounds Aaron Dykes and it's
[01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:26.160]  not even advertised as weight loss is that you're always hungry because there's
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:30.960]  no minerals or vitamins in it as soon as Aaron got on this stuff he lost 92
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:33.920]  pounds in fact guys you can go show that video on screen while folks are

[01:55:52.400 --> 01:55:56.280]  it I love the hitter stories I love to have people talk to me about you know
[01:55:56.280 --> 01:56:02.400]  them being on cancer and and taking the chemo and energy is just bad and the
[01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:07.720]  only thing that that can help them to be able to get up and move is drinking that
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:11.880]  rebound I mean I love to hear stories like that well tell us I mean how many
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:15.400]  of the other NBA people have you turned on to this I mean are they getting
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:21.320]  similar results I'm I've turned guys on I've turned a lot of guys on to it you
[01:56:21.320 --> 01:56:27.840]  know it's a matter of being a diligent student oh yeah I was selling it and
[01:56:27.840 --> 01:56:32.160]  didn't really get on it for about a year I mean I believe that it saw results
[01:56:32.160 --> 01:56:37.280]  okay here's a you know great thing but I did when I really started seeing I mean
[01:56:37.280 --> 01:56:42.920]  incredible results I mean it really is amazing yeah just say the ones that that
[01:56:42.920 --> 01:56:48.320]  used it were very impressed on how much energy and how it helped them
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:52.560]  sustain their energy and and the product itself just you know how healthy the
[01:56:52.560 --> 01:56:57.480]  product was as far as their amount of minerals and vitamins that it has
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:01.720]  within the product and it was a natural product they were very impressed with
[01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:07.720]  that and also you know the guys that used it also had pretty long careers where
[01:57:07.720 --> 01:57:11.840]  they were pretty much in bad shape too because most of the time people don't
[01:57:11.840 --> 01:57:17.740]  you really turn to this until it's a do or die situation what about the
[01:57:17.740 --> 01:57:21.680]  nutritionist I mean I noticed now see when I go to like Whole Foods or Central
[01:57:21.680 --> 01:57:27.080]  Market to big nicer grocery stores suddenly there's other products kind of
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:30.800]  touting the same thing but I noticed they don't have the mighty 90 like Doc
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:34.800]  Wallach's products and rebound and others have it and I mean you know the
[01:57:34.800 --> 01:57:41.280]  original now being copied but still the best yes sir yes sir well what does your
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:45.400]  wife think of this I mean if it gave you ten more years in the NBA that's a lot
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:53.240]  of moolah oh yes she's loving it she she she enjoyed she enjoyed the benefits
[01:57:53.240 --> 01:57:58.760]  well it's amazing well I tell you I take rebound before I go into the gym and
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:02.880]  my only issue is I'm already pretty wound up and when you get all the things
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:07.040]  that are in this it just I mean just absolutely turbo charges you but I
[01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.520]  I particularly like the liquid version what's your favorite the powder or the
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:16.240]  liquid yeah I like the powder I like it I like a citrus sponge because especially
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:21.160]  work while I was playing because I'm moving around so I got used to doing
[01:58:21.160 --> 01:58:25.720]  the powder a lot lot easier you know to carry and I have to worry about spelling
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:33.480]  oh yeah it's smaller and that's a good point absolutely Theo Ratliff is our
[01:58:33.480 --> 01:58:37.800]  guest folks big pharma does not want you to know about this this is a real
[01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:51.360]  revolution you are listening to GCN visit GCN live comm today the worst
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:55.560]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest
[01:58:55.560 --> 01:59:00.280]  half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not
[01:59:00.280 --> 01:59:04.280]  only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted
[01:59:04.280 --> 01:59:08.520]  raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of
[01:59:08.520 --> 01:59:12.560]  business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this is to
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:16.760]  freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from
[01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:20.960]  e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods will have
[01:59:20.960 --> 01:59:24.840]  to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I recently increased my

[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:20.160]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.160 --> 02:00:23.760]  Alex Jones
[02:00:27.960 --> 02:00:33.680]  we've got him for three more segments or 30 minutes Theo Ratliff I'm not even
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:36.720]  somebody that has time over the years to watch sports but even I know who he is
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:42.440]  one of the top blockers in the NBA history star at the Los Angeles Lakers
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:48.200]  the list goes on and on he also is the owner of the Rome gladiators and he
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:51.240]  also has a degree in communications from the University of Wyoming and they
[02:00:51.240 --> 02:00:56.040]  developed the proprietary rebound because he was such a fan of young Jebedy
[02:00:56.040 --> 02:01:00.080]  and chalks up 10 more years in the league to it now we have Dr. Wallach and
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:04.240]  in between Theo getting all excited me getting excited the doc sitting over
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:08.240]  there but folks you know I mean I only get excited about stuff I'm excited about
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:11.720]  that's all got carnival Barker here and that's not the best way to pitch
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:15.960]  something but I am here promoting this because it really does work I mean
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:20.720]  people that have Alzheimer's we've seen go on this and get their memory back
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.760]  like Ted Anderson's dad and then the doctor says go off of it you're not
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:27.160]  allowed to have vitamin K or leafy vegetables and his dad has his skin
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:32.480]  just rotting off with scurvy basically and Ted wants the story told the doctor
[02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:37.440]  told his wife Ted's dad you know hey don't let him have this you
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:40.400]  don't let him have Beyond Tangy Tangerine stuff so he didn't and now he
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.640]  doesn't know who he is again I mean I hate to use that but it's the truth I
[02:01:43.640 --> 02:01:48.760]  mean the medical Dr. Wallach how many of the medical doctors know this and how
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:53.560]  many are just compartmentalized idiots we know big pharma knows it we're
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:58.880]  exactly right Alex the crime is that all the medical doctors know this but
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:02.640]  they're profit-driven and there's no law requiring a doctor to cure you and
[02:02:02.640 --> 02:02:07.040]  there's a cure available and so they choose to manage symptoms for instance
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:11.920]  when you have diabetes if they were to make you an X diabetic to cure you and
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:15.760]  they can do this always say in four weeks you're able to wean off your
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:19.320]  medication go back to normal life be an X diabetic in four weeks the doctor will
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:24.080]  make $300 in office calls but if he manages your diabetes for 25 years
[02:02:24.080 --> 02:02:30.240]  he'll make $750,000 so they always go for the management of the disease rather
[02:02:30.240 --> 02:02:33.280]  than just getting rid of it there's no money in it for getting rid of it and
[02:02:33.280 --> 02:02:38.760]  they're a protected monopoly they have absolutely no competitors and the
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:42.080]  government protects them I want to talk about this more when we come back but
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.320]  this is a short segment long segment coming up I mean you've known Theo a
[02:02:46.320 --> 02:02:49.600]  lot longer than I have I've just seen him on TV and I'm talking to him here for
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:54.040]  the first time what should I be asking Theo right now or Theo jump in here
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:03:01.360]  cuz I'll run over you well basically we need to be asking Theo the reason why
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:04.480]  these other athletes didn't pick up on it because the average lifespan when you
[02:03:04.480 --> 02:03:08.520]  take all professional athletes is 62 professional football players the average
[02:03:08.520 --> 02:03:14.120]  lifespan is 51 it was just a recent study 51 it's absolutely tragic because
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.320]  they're all dying early because they're sweating out their nutrients not
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:24.560]  replacing them yeah Theo I mean people are really dumb when people even I know
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:28.440]  I mean I know this works they're like oh I don't need vitamins and minerals right
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:36.280]  I mean it's it's just a hard a hard hard sale it shouldn't be hard but it's hard
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:43.480]  I think a lot of it is due to a lot of the other products that don't do what it
[02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:50.080]  says it's supposed to do and and not I mean the the the products that are not
[02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:55.720]  the quality of a young Jevity I think has a lot to do with it and I think a
[02:03:55.720 --> 02:03:59.480]  lot of it just has to do with people people gonna listen to whatever the
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:04.760]  doctors tell them to do no no that's it the the MDs are God right I mean Ted
[02:04:04.760 --> 02:04:08.800]  Anderson told the story his dad didn't know he was his dad in six months came
[02:04:08.800 --> 02:04:15.320]  back we knew who he was the wounds were healing what are those wounds that the
[02:04:15.320 --> 02:04:19.640]  old people get I mean isn't that pretty much scurvy Dr. Wallach certainly could
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:25.320]  be scurvy it could be circulation problems it could be actually gluten
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:29.240]  intolerance where they eat too much wheat barley around oats and their skin
[02:04:29.240 --> 02:04:33.520]  will actually dry up and get ulcerated and they get eczema and dermatitis and
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:37.280]  so there's multiple causes of that but if you straighten up your diet you take
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:40.640]  the 90 cents of nutrients that all goes away I will stay there we're gonna come
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:44.000]  back and I'm gonna hand it over to you doc because I know you've got the
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:48.200]  questions for Theo you guys have known each other for 11 years I want to talk
[02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:52.760]  about this when we come back amazing to have Theo Ratliff just retired got an

[02:08:47.200 --> 02:08:50.920]  American former professional basketball player just retired who last played with
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:54.400]  the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and he's listed as one of the all-time greatest
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:09:00.040]  blockers amongst other things his amazing websites are future phenom.com
[02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:06.440]  and rebound for energy.com we have those linked at info wars health.com and he
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:10.600]  joins us right now he also owns the Rome gladiators and he's on with us with Dr.
[02:09:10.600 --> 02:09:15.360]  Wallach. Dr. Wallach I want to ask you this question why is exercise without
[02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:19.960]  supplementation suicide in your words and then I want you for the remaining 20
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:23.940]  minutes we have left with Theo here to take it away with you know I want you
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:26.560]  to interview him just because I know you guys have known each other for so
[02:09:26.560 --> 02:09:30.240]  long and I know how much Theo you know admires the work you've done so do I.
[02:09:30.240 --> 02:09:34.200]  Well people realize you're the guy that's beaten the Food and Drug
[02:09:34.200 --> 02:09:38.720]  Administration repeatedly in court or we have Codex Salimentarius here banning
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:42.680]  us having access to vitamin minerals I mean it just I don't people realize who
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:45.920]  we're on the air with right now and just how much you've done for Liberty
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:50.320]  because I'm all about Liberty and this health issue is something we can take
[02:09:50.320 --> 02:09:54.560]  control of the system once a sick that's what MD Rockefeller medicine is all
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:10:00.120]  about. Well thank you for the kind words Alec really appreciate that and you're
[02:10:00.120 --> 02:10:04.480]  certainly right you're you're my hero because you're on the people that need
[02:10:04.480 --> 02:10:09.920]  to be watched and we appreciate that well we did actually make a CD based on
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:15.040]  Theo stories called dead athletes don't lie and this goes on to the statement
[02:10:15.040 --> 02:10:20.840]  you mentioned exercise the supplementation is suicide now that's
[02:10:20.840 --> 02:10:24.320]  because you do sweat out nutrients in great amounts when you sweat whether
[02:10:24.320 --> 02:10:28.120]  you're exercising you're a roofer you're working in a steel factory you're
[02:10:28.120 --> 02:10:31.760]  digging trenches throwing bales of hay if you're sweating you're sweating out
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:35.200]  whatever nutrients you have floating around in your blood if you have 90
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:37.760]  cents of nutrients which most people don't unless they're suppling with
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:41.760]  young givety products you're sweating out 90 cents of nutrients not just water
[02:10:41.760 --> 02:10:48.360]  if you are only consuming say 70 nutrients you're sweating out all 70
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:53.320]  nutrients you're drinking water your nutrient levels go down if you're
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:56.800]  drinking Gatorade you're 88 short if you're drinking rebound you're getting
[02:10:56.800 --> 02:11:01.960]  all 100 nutrients and in rebound including all the essential nutrients
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:07.480]  you need and so it's imperative if you're gonna sweat you have to supplement
[02:11:07.480 --> 02:11:10.760]  properly and rebound as part of the system to replace not only the fluid
[02:11:10.760 --> 02:11:15.520]  you're losing but also the nutrients we have Olympic athletes a deletion of
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:21.560]  Jones who Theo knows very well great lady a basketball player she has won four
[02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:25.760]  gold medals in Olympics she's been with us for 12 years even a year before we
[02:11:25.760 --> 02:11:32.600]  started with Theo and she attributes her four gold medals to the healthy start
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:37.960]  packs the extra gluco gel to support and promote maintenance repair of her joints
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:42.280]  ligaments tendons connective tissue cartilage and also she loves the rebound
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:46.120]  and I think she kind of likes looking at Theo's picture too he's a great lady
[02:11:46.120 --> 02:11:50.080]  listen to this I want to break this down for Theo because I got one question I
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:52.720]  kind of interrupted me brought this up and I want you to ask some quick
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:56.200]  questions and spend some time with Theo while we've got him here Theo you sort
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:00.240]  of getting into your grandmother and you know folks in the old days knew that
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:04.400]  you needed minerals veterinarians like Doc Wallach I mean I've worked for a
[02:12:04.400 --> 02:12:08.160]  large animal vet it's all about minerals that's what you know mineral feeds
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:11.360]  mineral blocks but I mean what were you trying to say about your grandma and
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:16.120]  that's why this stuff made sense to you well I mean just from from back in the
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:21.880]  day Dr. Wallach always tell a great story about you know how he got into the
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:28.760]  minerals on the farm with with his with his father and being on the farm and
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:32.240]  raising the cattle and different things of that nature and using the minerals
[02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:38.680]  and back in the day you know my grandmother when we got sick or certain
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:44.720]  things happened Colovoy was always our remedy which is you know vitamin E you
[02:12:44.720 --> 02:12:50.800]  know so so that was that was always a big thing and then you know from a town
[02:12:50.800 --> 02:12:56.920]  called the Maplers Alabama so we had the clay you know the clay was a big thing
[02:12:56.920 --> 02:13:00.800]  see I didn't even know you were gonna say that but but I said clay cuz folks in
[02:13:00.800 --> 02:13:05.200]  Texas know eat the certain clay because it's got the minerals in it right right
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:09.720]  right and just just different things that of that nature and you know back
[02:13:09.720 --> 02:13:14.880]  then I was our ground was so rich in nutrients at the time growing growing
[02:13:14.880 --> 02:13:20.600]  stuff in the garden and different things of that nature so it made sense you know
[02:13:20.600 --> 02:13:24.840]  when he was started talking about the plant derived minerals and the
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:28.880]  absorption in your body it's a natural state well it's funny that the old
[02:13:28.880 --> 02:13:32.920]  timers knew all this because when my dad was sick as a kid his nanny would try to
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.280]  give him clay and he'd eat it and at first my grandma was like hey that's not
[02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:39.600]  good but he would actually get better when she gave him that and other things
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:44.840]  and turns out she knew what she was doing yeah yeah it's funny how it works
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:49.160]  like that it's you know what they're talking about Dr. Wallick what's in the
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:53.840]  clay versus what's in I mean that's the plant derived minerals isn't it well
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:57.200]  the plant derived minerals are actually a compost it's actually plants the clay
[02:13:57.200 --> 02:14:02.440]  or minerals silt from fine particles off of rocks and you're both getting close
[02:14:02.440 --> 02:14:07.500]  to the story and if I may I'll ask both of you this question what did your
[02:14:07.500 --> 02:14:11.000]  grandma and grandpa do with the wood ashes from their wood stove every morning
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:15.520]  where did they go it went in the garden in the garden in the garden exactly well
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:19.960]  wood ashes not really ashes wood ashes are the minerals that are left when you
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:24.840]  burn wood for fuel and you put these wood ashes aka plant minerals into the
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:28.560]  garden the squash and the sweet potatoes the onions and the pumpkins and the
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:32.320]  corn and tomatoes and beans and peas would suck up those minerals you ate
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:36.640]  those vegetables and grains and you got your minerals in that fashion well three
[02:14:36.640 --> 02:14:41.160]  o'clock in the afternoon Monday September 4th 1882 Thomas Edison pulled
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:44.800]  the switch in the first commercial electric generating plant on Pearl Street
[02:14:44.800 --> 02:14:48.600]  New York City and five years later just about everybody had an electric stove or
[02:14:48.600 --> 02:14:53.680]  propane stove or a natural gas stove and and where did you get your minerals
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:57.240]  when nobody's putting wood ashes into the garden anymore we began to break down
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:02.280]  and that's where the the problem came and of course when Theo moved away from
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:07.320]  the farm living with grandma and a great grandma and his mom he didn't have
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.960]  access to foods grown and all those minerals from the wood ashes going into
[02:15:11.960 --> 02:15:15.880]  the garden every day he came to the cities or the universities were and they
[02:15:15.880 --> 02:15:19.800]  got food grown from the big farms where they had chemical fertilizer rather than
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.000]  wood ashes with two with two minerals in it that exact two or three plants only
[02:15:24.000 --> 02:15:27.840]  need three human beings need 60 so if you're eating a pretty good slice of
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:31.920]  organically grown multigrain bread baked with the love by the pastor's wife in
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:37.040]  church on Sunday or 57 short and then you've got the trace elements how
[02:15:37.040 --> 02:15:41.160]  important are you ask the questions Theo's sitting here and we're we're
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:46.480]  ranting Raven dog we can do that any day Theo other points you want to make well
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:50.520]  the trace elements feels very familiar with them the sudden deaths that occur
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.480]  in famous athletes like Reggie Lewis died of a cardiomyopathy heart attack
[02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:01.240]  these kind of course these kids there's somewhere around 75,000 100,000 young
[02:16:01.240 --> 02:16:04.440]  Americans under the age of 30 dropped dead suddenly each year while they're
[02:16:04.440 --> 02:16:08.280]  exercising because they sweat out a particular trace element called selenium
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:12.400]  a selenium deficiency alone causes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy heart
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:16.280]  disease which is the most common cause of sudden death that happened when I was
[02:16:16.280 --> 02:16:22.600]  eight years old playing football the star running back just fell over dead of a
[02:16:22.600 --> 02:16:25.680]  heart attack and they did the autopsy he didn't have any heart defects and they
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:30.880]  said we don't know why he died he died of a selenium deficiency and the reason
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:37.480]  why they say he they don't know every medical examiner should take a course in
[02:16:37.480 --> 02:16:42.600]  chemical nutritional deficiencies that cause sudden death they don't know
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:46.680]  anything about that and as a result this problem is perpetuated now I
[02:16:46.680 --> 02:16:51.040]  actually went to China and did 1200 autopsies on kids under the age of 10 in
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:56.160]  Qixiang province in China that died of this cardiomyopathy heart disease is
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:16:59.760]  published in an international field you'll give us your take on the trace
[02:16:59.760 --> 02:17:08.880]  minerals yeah a lot of the guys in the league tend to have heart issues after
[02:17:08.880 --> 02:17:14.680]  they're done and you know from being a part of young Jevity and and speaking
[02:17:14.680 --> 02:17:20.160]  with Dr. Wilek and speaking to some of the professionals on the selenium you
[02:17:20.160 --> 02:17:25.760]  know if you're taking this selenium then those things go away not and like I
[02:17:25.760 --> 02:17:30.280]  say when you're playing you're sweating out your nutrients you're sweating out
[02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:34.640]  your minerals you're breaking down your calcium in your body so you have so many
[02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:41.080]  different diseases and so many different things that mental deficiencies
[02:17:41.080 --> 02:17:47.160]  create diseases from that if you don't put it in then everything starts to
[02:17:47.160 --> 02:17:50.880]  break out but if the doctor tell you they won't get to shop you up and make
[02:17:50.880 --> 02:17:57.480]  money right it pains me to see some of these retired guys that I see now you
[02:17:57.480 --> 02:18:01.720]  know being retired I see a lot more of the guys and their bodies are broken
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:09.080]  down and in need replacements here replacements shoulder I mean it goes it
[02:18:09.080 --> 02:18:13.720]  goes on and on and on and as they continue to put those chemicals in their
[02:18:13.720 --> 02:18:17.760]  body they steady breaking breaking down their insights and everything else
[02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:21.600]  through all the drugs and different stuff that they have to take and I try to
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:25.920]  explain to a lot of the guys that you've got to get your body get it get it back
[02:18:25.920 --> 02:18:30.240]  healthy we're putting the proper minerals that can the plant derived
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:35.440]  minerals from the young Jevity to be able to build your body back and it can
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:40.000]  happen even no matter what age you are it can still happen for it's been
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:43.920]  miraculous my mother's run triathlons for a long time and she just hit a wall
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.760]  and now she says it's like 15 years ago she lost weight her muscles got soft
[02:18:48.760 --> 02:18:54.720]  again I mean my mother is not a media person and she's ready to go on air and
[02:18:54.720 --> 02:19:00.120]  talk about what young Jevity's done for her it's that powerful that's beautiful
[02:19:00.120 --> 02:19:04.080]  that's a beautiful thing but like you said Theo it's frustrating when people
[02:19:04.080 --> 02:19:08.160]  heard all these other fake claims then they think everything's bull I guess
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:14.040]  right right and I think that's that's what you're fighting besides just the
[02:19:14.040 --> 02:19:19.040]  doctors and the medicine you know they're masking pain you know giving it
[02:19:19.040 --> 02:19:23.360]  the steroids and different things shooting shooting people up all the
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:27.840]  time letting it go away for a couple of weeks and then it comes back on them and
[02:19:27.840 --> 02:19:33.600]  then they got to do it again I mean that that's a big issue it is so they
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:37.360]  again folks notice they never want to find that why we're all getting autism
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:43.480]  or neurological disorders or cancer exploding or diabetes it's always let's
[02:19:43.480 --> 02:19:46.600]  find a cure let's find a cure it's like it's like not asking why people are
[02:19:46.600 --> 02:19:50.760]  getting shot in the head let's find a cure to be in shot in the head no let's
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:55.520]  find out why so many people are getting shot in the head and they know that
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:19:59.000]  that's why the UN and others don't want you to have vitamins and minerals they
[02:19:59.000 --> 02:20:05.600]  want to shut this down big business has discovered the preparedness market and

[02:25:02.200 --> 02:25:05.240]  Wallach because I know he's chomping at the bit to talk about things but I've
[02:25:05.240 --> 02:25:08.040]  been asking a lot of questions what else would you like to tell people about
[02:25:08.040 --> 02:25:12.600]  longevity about rebound about how big a deal it is because if I'm way I mean
[02:25:12.600 --> 02:25:16.200]  people know me I don't just sit here and harp and harp and harp on things that
[02:25:16.200 --> 02:25:19.040]  I'm pitching sure we make money out of this but I make money out of things I
[02:25:19.040 --> 02:25:23.280]  believe in that fight the tyranny fight the corrupt medical system I sleep
[02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:28.080]  really good at night promoting this and as that's why it's getting so big the
[02:25:28.080 --> 02:25:32.120]  longevity overalls up 30% just for me promoting it in the last year because
[02:25:32.120 --> 02:25:38.480]  people are really having the effect it's not just hype no it's it's real well
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:43.360]  I just want to say that we appreciate you we appreciate what you do and what
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:47.320]  you've done you know for young Jebedy and for the rebound product has been
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:52.680]  been great getting the word out to people about this great product and you
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:56.360]  know we just want you to keep on keep on doing your thing and keep letting
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:26:00.440]  people know open opening people eyes up to what's really going on as far as I
[02:26:00.440 --> 02:26:06.560]  dealt with their health and I also wanted to say that the kids I mean I do a
[02:26:06.560 --> 02:26:11.240]  lot of things with kids I have an activity center back home Theo Theo
[02:26:11.240 --> 02:26:14.840]  Radler Foundation back home I have activity center work with a lot of
[02:26:14.840 --> 02:26:21.760]  kids and I always do a camp of like 300 or so kids each year for free for the
[02:26:21.760 --> 02:26:27.600]  kids and I bring this product and the kids love it you know and it's in my
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:32.880]  activity center they love it my kids love it I don't let them do sports or
[02:26:32.880 --> 02:26:36.680]  play anything or do anything without taking minimums you know and that's
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:41.040]  that's the key if you get them early my five-year-olds they love it when they
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:45.960]  see me drink daddy I need some of that rebound give me
[02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:55.040]  they already think they are Ron James and D ways so so they they're taking it
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.280]  they take the kids kids toddy and take those take those products that are
[02:27:00.280 --> 02:27:05.480]  made for kids also so it's something that once you start them early and it
[02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:09.120]  becomes their routine and they know about health and they know why they're
[02:27:09.120 --> 02:27:14.280]  taking it it just becomes like clockwork you know it's it becomes
[02:27:14.280 --> 02:27:19.160]  easy as just picking up a pencil and writing writing every day so I always
[02:27:19.160 --> 02:27:23.280]  wanted one of want to let that out there is that you know it's definitely a big
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:28.080]  thing that starts with the kids and we always want to bring the kids into
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:32.520]  something that's gonna make them great not just physically but also mentally at
[02:27:32.520 --> 02:27:37.800]  the same time well I was about to say I felt major mental changes once I got on
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:43.240]  this more energy better thought processes more aggressive because I
[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:46.560]  always been an aggressive person I mean did you see any mental changes once you
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:52.280]  got on young Jevvie oh yes definitely I mean you know like with with us you know
[02:27:52.280 --> 02:27:59.960]  one of the things that a major thing with mineral deficiency is what the
[02:27:59.960 --> 02:28:05.120]  athlete is sleeping you know if I said and I try to read a book or try to read
[02:28:05.120 --> 02:28:10.160]  read my emails or something I end up falling asleep you know back you know
[02:28:10.160 --> 02:28:14.480]  back when I first before I got on the product but now that I've been on the
[02:28:14.480 --> 02:28:18.920]  product I can sit down I can kind of try sit down and read a book I was about to
[02:28:18.920 --> 02:28:23.040]  say that's a side effect even though be a good one even though beyond tenny
[02:28:23.040 --> 02:28:27.320]  tangerine has no green tea extract no stimulant my mother and I we've all
[02:28:27.320 --> 02:28:30.680]  noticed if you take it at night you're hungry at ten you drink it you're not
[02:28:30.680 --> 02:28:38.200]  hungry anymore problem is you're not going to sleep yeah because because
[02:28:38.200 --> 02:28:43.080]  drugs wish that they were food they wish they were minerals and vitamins drugs
[02:28:43.080 --> 02:28:47.720]  try to it's just amazing it's amazing that the system knows this big farmers
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:53.600]  out of business if this word gets out to you oh yeah oh yeah like I say it's a
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:59.080]  great thing but a lot more healthier people that's the whole goal well we're

[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:12.960]  country I don't have to tell you about the power grid and just how vulnerable it
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:17.160]  is that's in the mainstream news every day millions of people have lost their
[02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:21.200]  power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:25.800]  pushing the grid beyond its capacity I've always said that every family needs
[02:30:25.800 --> 02:30:29.480]  to be ready for blackouts and if you don't have a backup system in place
[02:30:29.480 --> 02:30:33.520]  I've got a great opportunity for you right now our good friends at solutions

[02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:50.680]  because they're solar powered that means there's no dangerous fumes and no

[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:06.400]  it's pro peer discounted at infowors.com or whether it's the young Jebedy
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:11.800]  products discounted there at infoworshealth.com but the revolution of
[02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:16.920]  minerals itself I wanted to spring this on Dr. Wallach my dad who I think I am
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:22.160]  gonna get in studio about a bunch of issues he's a dentist oral surgeon he
[02:34:22.160 --> 02:34:28.160]  goes down he volunteers for a big charity and once a year he goes to police or he
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:33.240]  goes to Mexico or he goes to Central America for the first time he went to
[02:34:33.240 --> 02:34:40.480]  Paraguay earlier this year for a couple weeks a piece of dynamite the news said
[02:34:40.480 --> 02:34:43.240]  a hand grenade it was a piece of dynamite got thrown at a soccer game the
[02:34:43.240 --> 02:34:47.280]  one day they had off you know like one of the last days they go my dad saw the
[02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:49.960]  guy throw the dynamite he grew up on a farm he knew dynamite he's to blow
[02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:53.760]  stumps up and blew up some of the umpires and people my dad saw that he's
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:57.360]  like yeah he got back said yeah I saw this I went looked it up and there it
[02:34:57.360 --> 02:35:02.240]  was but the point is he was down in Paraguay and the Amish are the only
[02:35:02.240 --> 02:35:06.560]  people holding the country up they went into the rocky desert north most of a
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:10.320]  jungle but the north a couple hundred years ago when they got driven out of
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:16.400]  Russia and other areas and so they went there and they developed it and now they
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:19.600]  produce more than half the food in the country and my dad has all the names but
[02:35:19.600 --> 02:35:23.480]  there's this one-head Amish guy who's basically industrializing the whole
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:26.560]  country for people now you think of them as not being industrial but you know
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:32.200]  just basic you know food water you know aquifers all this stuff at the Amish
[02:35:32.200 --> 02:35:36.280]  know and it's one of the biggest Amish colonies down there and my dad had all
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:39.440]  the literature and stuff it was in Spanish he can read Spanish I can't but
[02:35:39.440 --> 02:35:42.320]  he was explaining that they used to have all these street kids there and they
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:46.640]  have them all over Latin America who are basically have different disorders
[02:35:46.640 --> 02:35:51.160]  mentally retarded but not genetically they don't have extra chromosomes or
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:56.520]  chromosomal problems they just have the all sorts of mental problems they're
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:01.720]  stunted and it was very simple there's no nutrition the few orphanages that
[02:36:01.720 --> 02:36:05.360]  give them you know beans and rice they don't get what they need the Amish have
[02:36:05.360 --> 02:36:10.640]  started giving in little candies minerals and basically I was looking at it
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:14.400]  it's close to young Jevity what they've come up with down there they just give
[02:36:14.400 --> 02:36:19.280]  the little kids the Mennonites do and the Amish and the UN's trying to shut
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:22.640]  them down and hate some because they want to deindustrialize it but the point
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:28.240]  is that's exactly what's going on and so now the Amish are helping people with
[02:36:28.240 --> 02:36:34.080]  incredible results because the kids elite the candies and now it's eradicating
[02:36:34.080 --> 02:36:38.440]  all these different disorders just amazing that this knowledge is starting
[02:36:38.440 --> 02:36:43.480]  to be discovered by others Dr. Wallach well it's a good thing Alex certainly is
[02:36:43.480 --> 02:36:46.760]  the basic need of all vertebrates whether you're a turtle or an elephant or a
[02:36:46.760 --> 02:36:50.520]  human being we all need the 90th century nutrients and this is a worldwide thing
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:55.400]  the top 20 longevity cultures around the world are found all over the place
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:59.960]  including Central America and South America and it's a dumb luck they live
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.960]  in a place it has lots of minerals in the soil and the wood they burn the trees
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:07.720]  suck up the minerals they put the wood ashes in the gardens well these are
[02:37:07.720 --> 02:37:11.560]  relatively small areas we can't get seven billion people from the entire
[02:37:11.560 --> 02:37:16.600]  world populations to move in those places so we have to create the same
[02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:20.600]  environment wherever we are and we can do this by supplementation we can add 25
[02:37:20.600 --> 02:37:24.880]  to 50 health for years for our life we can take a broken down professional
[02:37:24.880 --> 02:37:30.000]  athlete like Theo who's become just an icon in professional athletics to add
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:34.880]  10 years to add 10 years to his professional playing life just by
[02:37:34.880 --> 02:37:38.380]  taking a supplement I mean you think about that what what if you can add 10
[02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:42.120]  years to everybody's life in America in a health away I believe we can do that
[02:37:42.120 --> 02:37:47.640]  and this is a worldwide problem and it's something that through your help and
[02:37:47.640 --> 02:37:51.720]  you're one of our heroes certainly getting this message out because we can
[02:37:51.720 --> 02:37:58.200]  save America through your help financially and certainly health-wise and I
[02:37:58.200 --> 02:38:01.200]  don't mind if the doctors go out of business so we really don't need them
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:06.000]  they have legislated themselves into a certain position where they have a look
[02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:10.320]  at what police states they are marijuana has shown it has no bad effects on
[02:38:10.320 --> 02:38:14.600]  fetuses but they'll tell women take prozac take all these drugs that we
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:19.160]  know attack them take vaccines until four years ago all medical doctors all
[02:38:19.160 --> 02:38:23.480]  inserts said don't get pregnant women vaccines it causes autoimmune problems it
[02:38:23.480 --> 02:38:27.320]  causes miscarriages now they're pushing it and I see the stories rolling in of
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:31.720]  professional women who aren't even pot smokers going in they don't tell you
[02:38:31.720 --> 02:38:36.760]  they're blood testing you for drugs boom THC they come take your baby they
[02:38:36.760 --> 02:38:40.420]  don't tell you these hospitals are prisons now they're now making the
[02:38:40.420 --> 02:38:44.520]  healthcare providers take vaccines these it happened in Russia it happened in
[02:38:44.520 --> 02:38:50.080]  Nazi Germany it happened in Soviet China or communist China that the medical
[02:38:50.080 --> 02:38:55.520]  system is a tyranny it's great of your legs broken it does some good but that's
[02:38:55.520 --> 02:38:59.480]  kind of like the mafia does some good yeah but they also do a lot more bad
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:04.240]  exactly well I'll tell you those recent one course you know Neil Armstrong died
[02:39:04.240 --> 02:39:09.640]  he was actually killed by a doctor he didn't die of a heart attack he had his
[02:39:09.640 --> 02:39:12.800]  physical and he was 82 years old and said you know you're pretty strong Neil
[02:39:12.800 --> 02:39:15.960]  for 82 years old we got this little blockage your artery why don't you let
[02:39:15.960 --> 02:39:19.640]  us do a bypass before you have a heart attack we you know if you have a heart
[02:39:19.640 --> 02:39:24.240]  attack or a crisis you might die but now you're healthy now's the time to let us
[02:39:24.240 --> 02:39:29.040]  do a bypass and they did a bypass on him and he died of a blood clot as a result
[02:39:29.040 --> 02:39:33.740]  of that surgery these doctors killed Neil Armstrong they don't get an
[02:39:33.740 --> 02:39:37.520]  investigation they don't get a urine test to see if they were drunk they
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:41.480]  don't get a urine test to see if they're on drugs and you don't even know what
[02:39:41.480 --> 02:39:46.640]  the doctor's name had killed Neil Armstrong well I know this one of my
[02:39:46.640 --> 02:39:52.520]  dad's really good friends is a former Olympic swimmer and a very successful
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:54.440]  businessman I'm not gonna get to the whole story even though I'm not saying
[02:39:54.440 --> 02:39:57.080]  the guy's name I probably shouldn't tell the story but he sued and
[02:39:57.080 --> 02:40:01.520]  successfully won the medical doctor they talked him into getting two stents
[02:40:01.520 --> 02:40:06.240]  and they put in like 12 or something just because the doctor made more money
[02:40:06.240 --> 02:40:09.440]  and it turned out this so-called you know well-to-do doctor was doing this to a
[02:40:09.440 --> 02:40:13.040]  bunch of people and it's now been run out of business here in Austin but the
[02:40:13.040 --> 02:40:17.880]  point is that's incredible that he didn't need probably even the two stents
[02:40:17.880 --> 02:40:21.280]  but he went in and did it and then they did and the guy to make more money just
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.160]  put a whole bunch in there and basically has really hurt this guy's
[02:40:27.160 --> 02:40:33.640]  lifespan exactly of course that's why the Medicare cost in hospices has gone
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:39.480]  up 70% in one year because when grandma is in hospice unconscious in a coma
[02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:43.640]  they'll do a hysterectomy on her double mastectomy double hip replacement
[02:40:43.640 --> 02:40:49.240]  double knee replacement and make $200,000 on her getting all the money out of her
[02:40:49.240 --> 02:40:54.800]  Medicare fund before she dies because they have the right to do that some
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:57.840]  well-known Austinites that are good friends of mine if I said their name
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:02.720]  everybody in Austin know I'm talking about they live out on Lake Austin in a
[02:41:02.720 --> 02:41:09.440]  rattlesnake she went out to take the trash out and a little baby rattlesnake
[02:41:09.440 --> 02:41:13.120]  which is the worst because they pump all their venomum bitter and she felt fine
[02:41:13.120 --> 02:41:16.640]  they said well let's go to the hospital now they sell snake venom in Arizona in
[02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:22.040]  the stores for 20 bucks because they had top-flight insurance their bill was
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:28.240]  $300 plus thousand dollars for two days in the hospital just just pure robbery
[02:41:28.240 --> 02:41:31.960]  and the insurance company challenged it got it down to a hundred thousand I mean
[02:41:31.960 --> 02:41:37.000]  all they did was put an IV in her with anti-venom $100,000 I mean I mean how
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:41.440]  did they get away with this because of insurance if there was no insurance
[02:41:41.440 --> 02:41:45.880]  Alex nobody would tolerate that kind of stuff because there's insurance they
[02:41:45.880 --> 02:41:51.560]  have no competition so there's no other options people feel the cost of health
[02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:57.280]  care has been driven up terribly and doctors can kill with impunity 15
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:00.320]  million people in America are killed injured infected in the doctor's
[02:42:00.320 --> 02:42:04.520]  workplace every year they do not even get an ocean ticket nobody would fly
[02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:08.040]  commercial airlines if they knew that commercial airlines killed injured
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:11.760]  infected 15 million of their passengers every year but because of insurance
[02:42:11.760 --> 02:42:16.160]  people say well insurance pays for it let's just go to the doctor and of
[02:42:16.160 --> 02:42:20.880]  course if they do what you and I suggest to them we'll add 25 to 50 healthy
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:25.840]  years of their life and they'll be protected from what should I say an
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:32.280]  unnecessary death like Neil Armstrong like how much more money did Theo
[02:42:32.280 --> 02:42:36.760]  Ratliff in the NBA make in the 10 years that he was able to continue because of
[02:42:36.760 --> 02:42:43.720]  just getting basic minerals as over 40 million dollars probably cost him 300
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:47.280]  bucks a month and he made over 40 million dollars as a result of his
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:51.680]  extra 10 years well that's my only problem is if Theo was talking about
[02:42:51.680 --> 02:42:55.080]  getting the kids to do it when they're young I've got my kids asking for the
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:58.760]  essential fatty acids that you go you're proprietary blend asking for the
[02:42:58.760 --> 02:43:03.320]  beyond Tangy tangerine asking for these things because they've gotten on it and
[02:43:03.320 --> 02:43:06.200]  my wife's always been putting them on vitamins and minerals but yeah now we've
[02:43:06.200 --> 02:43:10.080]  shifted over to yours because it is the best blends but I have never done it in
[02:43:10.080 --> 02:43:14.160]  my life so I'll make myself for a few days do it and then quit and then
[02:43:14.160 --> 02:43:18.440]  remember to do it Aaron religiously committed and looks like Superman back
[02:43:18.440 --> 02:43:23.000]  there so I mean I've had incredible effects but I just need to somehow get
[02:43:23.000 --> 02:43:27.600]  myself in the regimen because when I do it then I'm not hungry and I feel even
[02:43:27.600 --> 02:43:31.440]  better and then I can go forward but I just in in such a habit of not pill
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:35.120]  popping but here's what I do because I'm on the road all the time you can see
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:39.600]  where I could say well I'm busy I didn't bring enough with me I actually bring a
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:42.520]  three-month supply with me even though I'm gonna be on the road only for four
[02:43:42.520 --> 02:43:48.320]  weeks I also build two bottles a day with all my settlements in each bottle I
[02:43:48.320 --> 02:43:52.320]  kind of pre-fill them while I'm watching TV at night looking at the news I'll
[02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:56.360]  fill all my bottles with all the various supplements the selenium the oceans
[02:43:56.360 --> 02:44:01.360]  gold that's the issue is there's all these bottles and I'm not hauling them
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.880]  around that's what it is and so what I do is instead of taking 20 bottles I'll
[02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:09.040]  just take one bottle with me that I've already pre-filled with all the stuff and
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:13.440]  I do that two bottles a day for about two weeks I pre-make them and when I get
[02:44:13.440 --> 02:44:16.840]  down to the last couple bottles I'll pre-make my two weeks again and so I just
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:20.880]  grab the bottles I bring my liquids with me and I do that twice a day I've been
[02:44:20.880 --> 02:44:25.920]  doing it religiously for 64 years by the way tell folks how old you are a 73 and
[02:44:25.920 --> 02:44:31.000]  haven't been to a medical doctor with me being the patient for 64 years yeah by
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:34.840]  the way the Skype is not the best representation of you you look like
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:40.880]  you're about I don't know 60 to 62 65 in the Skype in person on stage you look
[02:44:40.880 --> 02:44:45.600]  like you could be 60 years old 59 years old and I mean physically you're in
[02:44:45.600 --> 02:44:49.080]  such good shape is the amazing thing yeah well thank you yeah nobody's gonna
[02:44:49.080 --> 02:44:54.240]  steal an airplane with you or I on it Alex I'll tell you and and this is
[02:44:54.240 --> 02:44:58.960]  actually a testament to these nutrients the human body does not age based on
[02:44:58.960 --> 02:45:03.720]  chronological time the human body ages based on the presence of or lack of
[02:45:03.720 --> 02:45:07.280]  nutrients and if you take your nutrients you can be chronologically a hundred
[02:45:07.280 --> 02:45:12.520]  and biologically 30 well that's what Ray Kurzweil the top globalist says have
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:15.640]  you noticed Ray Kurzweil is saying what you're saying and basically takes a
[02:45:15.640 --> 02:45:20.760]  regimen that looks like you developed it yes exactly these people are on top of
[02:45:20.760 --> 02:45:24.080]  it because they're world they've been around they see who is successful in
[02:45:24.080 --> 02:45:28.480]  health and who isn't and the people of who are successful in health and
[02:45:28.480 --> 02:45:33.640]  longevity just like these long-lived cultures they have 100 says he cured
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:38.000]  himself a diabetes with a nutrient dents you know things similar to
[02:45:38.000 --> 02:45:42.880]  longevity oh absolutely I can't use the cure word technically but I can make you
[02:45:42.880 --> 02:45:48.280]  an ex diabetic in two to 14 days I did this with a top laboratory medical
[02:45:48.280 --> 02:45:53.160]  laboratory owner guy of the name of Murphy this guy here Jerry Murphy had
[02:45:53.160 --> 02:45:58.800]  terrible advanced diabetes he he services 7,000 hospitals a day as excess
[02:45:58.800 --> 02:46:02.760]  access to the best endocrinologist the best cutting-edge information on
[02:46:02.760 --> 02:46:07.280]  diabetes he was failing everything was going downhill and just a couple of months
[02:46:07.280 --> 02:46:11.960]  I was able to get him off his medication his a1c hemoglobin went from about eight
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:17.120]  down to four point three his blood sugar went with from a 171 with medication
[02:46:17.120 --> 02:46:22.040]  down to 71 without medication I mean look I mean look how it's exploding what

[02:48:20.160 --> 02:48:26.080]  it just mitigates so much of it I mean I mean the effects are just absolutely
[02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:30.920]  nothing less than the miraculous is the only word to describe it and when you

[02:48:54.600 --> 02:48:58.520]  left before we got a break when we come back get into all this look at this
[02:48:58.520 --> 02:49:03.840]  how China and US secretly tested genetically modified golden rice on
[02:49:03.840 --> 02:49:07.280]  children Chinese authorities are investigating allegations genetically
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:10.000]  modified rice has been tested on Chinese children as part of a research
[02:49:10.000 --> 02:49:14.960]  project backed by the US Department of Agriculture and it just goes into what
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:19.320]  they did six and eight years old well I mean what about the US government paid
[02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:25.040]  Israel already at 110,000 of their kids in the ringworm project here's a story
[02:49:25.040 --> 02:49:30.640]  at info wars.com and it links right to the news over in Japan Fukushima fish
[02:49:30.640 --> 02:49:35.120]  have 258 times safe levels of radiation and we now learn within three months of
[02:49:35.120 --> 02:49:41.080]  the blow up tuna caught off San Diego had high levels of radiation and the
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:45.880]  government kept that secret and just let you eat it amazing to have that news
[02:49:45.880 --> 02:49:49.040]  speaking of China I've got it here in my stack I don't know if I'll find it in
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:58.280]  time where again Al Gore's company he's on the board is helping them do test and
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:06.560]  forced abortions at at the Apple plants in China I mean I've said I know Apple
[02:50:06.560 --> 02:50:10.480]  tracks and traces you and they've got a good pitch and good products but I mean
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.000]  it's just an evil company but they're all evil but Apple is so much more evil
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:20.400]  it's like they're so evil and they tell you they're these great liberals I mean
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.200]  let me tell you something folks if I was on the board of Apple there wouldn't be
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:29.760]  one child abortions going on at the factory or suicide nets and people
[02:50:29.760 --> 02:50:33.240]  would work eight hours a day or if they wanted bonuses and we needed they could
[02:50:33.240 --> 02:50:37.720]  voluntarily work for more and here's the thing almost nothing goes into
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:42.840]  manufacturing these I've seen the numbers it's pure evil greed pure evil
[02:50:42.840 --> 02:50:47.280]  greed for a few dollars per iPhone those people can be treated like humans it's
