[00:00.000 --> 00:18.800]  you are listening to an info wars dot com frontline report it's alex jones
[00:18.800 --> 00:26.560]  it's tuesday november 7th 2017 and your host alex shows
[00:26.560 --> 00:31.440]  we have several informative guests today and also intend open the phones up to take your phone calls
[00:32.240 --> 00:39.440]  well president trump is delivering yet again as the economy continues to surge countless signs
[00:39.440 --> 00:46.800]  show the global establishment is beginning to buckle desperately as massive prosperity is
[00:46.800 --> 00:52.240]  shoved in their faces that is a byproduct of what trump's doing even the ultra rich that
[00:52.240 --> 00:58.400]  are anti-prosperity for the general public by and large are having to buckle with the global
[00:58.400 --> 01:03.360]  reassurgence of americana it is incredible and president trump continued to deliver he's now
[01:03.360 --> 01:07.840]  in south korea we'll get into that later when they attacked him on the second amendment he said no
[01:07.840 --> 01:14.720]  more guns are the answer good guys stopping bad guys not even the republican establishment will
[01:14.720 --> 01:20.560]  talk like that this is absolutely true in fact we have flat mass shootings the last 20 years
[01:20.560 --> 01:27.360]  overall shootings are down 61 percent according to the fbis own numbers since 1992 they hit their
[01:27.360 --> 01:34.000]  peak in 1988 believe me i remember when they were having 60 murders a weekend in dallas and it was
[01:34.000 --> 01:41.600]  the murder capital of the us uh not chicago i remember the peak 1988 uh but the point is is
[01:41.600 --> 01:46.880]  that it's down 61 percent they're creating this perception but still if you're one of the 26 dead
[01:46.880 --> 01:52.960]  it's it's it's still so real but to see hispanic and white and black folks hugging each other at
[01:52.960 --> 01:59.680]  the vigil and to see the two heroes uh was just amazing to see how these tragedies take us together
[01:59.680 --> 02:05.280]  and how the people in the town aren't letting them use it to disarm the public uh texas strong
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.400]  i'm proud of my state at the same time i'm very very sad by the tragedy here's a clip of the president
[02:10.400 --> 02:16.880]  in soul south korea having the topic brought up to him and tell him the truth you've talked about
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.400]  wanting to put extreme betting on people trying to come into the united states but i wonder if
[02:22.400 --> 02:26.880]  you would consider extreme betting for people trying to buy a gun well you know you're bringing
[02:26.880 --> 02:31.680]  up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now but it's okay if you feel that
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.440]  that's an appropriate question even though we're the heart of south korea if you did what you're
[02:37.440 --> 02:43.760]  suggesting there would have been no difference three days ago and you might not have had that very
[02:43.760 --> 02:51.760]  brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him
[02:52.560 --> 03:00.960]  and neutralize him and i can only say this if he didn't have a gun instead of having 26 dead
[03:00.960 --> 03:07.840]  he would have had hundreds more dead and are you considering any kind of gun control policy going
[03:07.840 --> 03:15.760]  forward because the city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is chicago and chicago is a
[03:15.760 --> 03:22.560]  disaster if this man didn't have a gun or a rifle you'd be talking about a much worse situation
[03:23.440 --> 03:30.240]  in the great state of texas out of the park truth veritas again i now know more mo on trump not
[03:30.240 --> 03:34.400]  just from articles i've read going back 30 years but from people that don't know very closely not
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.680]  just stone but stone confirmed at all at dinner this weekend somebody's got to make a documentary
[03:39.680 --> 03:48.400]  about the trumps his dad was a secret john bircher funding anti-communist stuff i mean i already knew
[03:48.400 --> 03:56.240]  some of that and trump was like a patreon sleeper cell it's incredible just like dr course he said
[03:56.240 --> 04:02.080]  last year before he got elected he said trump knew everything you knew alex before he were born
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.920]  anyway he played this whole thing it's i can't believe this is happening uh let's go out to
[04:07.920 --> 04:14.400]  break with one of the heroes who's saying he's not a hero steven wilford from southern one here it is
[04:14.400 --> 04:26.800]  is the people at that church they're friends of mine their family and every time i heard a shot
[04:26.800 --> 04:38.960]  i knew that that probably represented a life i was scared to death i was i was scared for me
[04:38.960 --> 04:44.720]  and i was scared for every one of them and i was scared for my own family that just lived less than
[04:44.720 --> 04:55.040]  a block away i got i'm no hero i am i am not we'll be back with more of this hero stay with us
[04:58.880 --> 05:04.640]  my fellow freedom lovers alex jones here with a very important message secret 12 40
[05:04.640 --> 05:10.080]  percent off the best vitamin b12 out there for my research take it under the tongue simply amazing
[05:10.080 --> 05:16.400]  that sale is continuing supermail vitality for stamina libido energy that's 30 percent off that's
[05:16.400 --> 05:21.680]  continuing and the other really really good news uh is that yes we're having to end the sale of 50
[05:21.680 --> 05:28.560]  percent off on anthroplex but dna force have for almost four months out of stock is back in stock
[05:28.560 --> 05:34.800]  25 percent off our flagship product also biome defense the great probiotic that is 25 percent off
[05:34.800 --> 05:40.800]  as well so a lot of things are selling out a lot of things are still at record sales like silver
[05:40.800 --> 05:45.840]  bullets super high quality colloidal silver is still 50 off and there's other sales that are
[05:45.840 --> 05:51.120]  still going but they're all about to end whether it's dna force or whether it's silver bullet
[05:51.120 --> 05:56.240]  it's all available right now at info wars life dot com or by calling toll free triple eight two five
[05:56.240 --> 06:08.240]  three three one three nine
[06:15.040 --> 06:19.040]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[06:19.040 --> 06:27.040]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[06:32.400 --> 06:41.200]  if it wasn't so dangerous it'd be comical to watch cnn msnbc nbc abc gbs constantly caught
[06:41.920 --> 06:48.000]  in fake news constantly caught doing dirty tricks against america against christians
[06:48.000 --> 06:57.600]  against gun owners and nastily stirring up racial and cultural divides to play us off against each
[06:57.600 --> 07:10.240]  other it's just so nasty it's so villainous it's so scumbagery it's so low but the good news is
[07:10.240 --> 07:17.200]  people more and more are watching it they're aware of it they're sick of it and they're breaking with
[07:17.200 --> 07:25.280]  it and i've got stacks of news here today from africa to asia to latin america south america
[07:25.280 --> 07:35.120]  north america the uk where the global order of the united nations e u program of unelected
[07:35.120 --> 07:42.000]  planetary government is collapsing now that it's out in the open now that people know it's
[07:42.000 --> 07:49.120]  authoritarian now that people know its aims it is dead on arrival just as i envisioned it would be
[07:50.320 --> 07:55.840]  knowing that something that's authoritarian if we just exposed it once it finally had to emerge
[07:55.840 --> 08:02.160]  in the final takeover phase people would be ready to reject it even though we'd be demonized
[08:02.160 --> 08:10.400]  in the process before it was admitted by exposing it we would be absolutely the definition of
[08:10.400 --> 08:17.600]  credibility once it was admitted i mean for me that was just a common-sense situation but even if
[08:18.960 --> 08:24.400]  the general public still didn't wake up enough thinking intellectual individuals would understand
[08:24.400 --> 08:30.720]  we were facing organized authoritarian criminal technocracy and resistance and the resistance
[08:30.720 --> 08:43.600]  is just begun but i tell you the due sex right out of nowhere donald trump completely hiding who
[08:43.600 --> 08:51.840]  he was not in a deceptive way being anti-nafta anti-gat anti-globalist but in his public persona
[08:51.840 --> 08:58.880]  just being the hotel and casino and golf course owner and then sucker punching the globalist so
[08:58.880 --> 09:06.480]  hard i'm gonna do a whole report on his dad and his older brother and the intel that i've gotten
[09:06.480 --> 09:12.080]  that i was able to then confirm in news articles from 40 50 years ago i've gone to the lexus nexus
[09:12.080 --> 09:18.320]  the tomsen reuters systems and found it all here and there but it's all true
[09:19.920 --> 09:26.880]  donald trump's dad was giving to the john bertz society and john welch when it first was founded
[09:26.880 --> 09:36.320]  i mean we have a secret ron paul basically as the president with all the stamina and with the
[09:36.320 --> 09:47.520]  gravitas and with the charisma that ron paul didn't have and that barry goldwater didn't have
[09:49.920 --> 09:56.080]  and that quite frankly ronald reagan didn't have i mean trump is already eclipsed reagan
[09:56.080 --> 10:02.960]  in what he's done in 10 months but again everything is timing reagan was not born into a time
[10:03.840 --> 10:10.320]  where the stakes were so high reagan was not president when the stakes were this high well
[10:10.320 --> 10:15.360]  they were serious the globals were trying to bankrupt us and take control of us and but man when
[10:15.360 --> 10:22.400]  when when when trump came in right as the global wave was cresting against globalism it's biblical
[10:22.400 --> 10:32.400]  it's providence and when ronald reagan met trump at a white house dinner one time he said i felt
[10:32.400 --> 10:37.200]  like i was shaking the hand of the president there's that photo of the meeting let's pull
[10:37.200 --> 10:42.720]  up ronald reagan and donald trump there's just destiny ladies and gentlemen there's destiny
[10:42.720 --> 10:48.560]  written all over this and everything you've done and i've done and drudge is done and all of us
[10:48.560 --> 10:58.560]  together building towards the awakening it's it's just over the top and trump is just delivering
[10:58.560 --> 11:05.280]  delivering delivering delivering delivering and more and more they can't hold it back and they're
[11:05.280 --> 11:10.720]  panicking and they're turning on each other and the globalists are running scared at the dnc
[11:10.720 --> 11:19.280]  the german military is planning and drilling for a breakup of the european union in 2040
[11:19.280 --> 11:24.080]  they don't want to panic people how about five years from now the european union as we know it
[11:24.080 --> 11:38.960]  will be gone by 2022 before the clock strikes december 31st 2022 mark my words the european
[11:38.960 --> 11:49.120]  union will be completely dissolved i'll be surprised if it lasts to 2020
[11:51.600 --> 11:57.840]  you heard it here again ladies and gentlemen deep analysis deep historical research deep
[11:57.840 --> 12:05.440]  focus deep commitment and i'm telling you right now for all intents and purposes
[12:05.440 --> 12:10.160]  within two and a half years it's going to be ceremonial and they're going to prop it up
[12:10.880 --> 12:19.200]  just so the institutions can keep robbing and looting and it will be gone in five years five
[12:19.200 --> 12:29.280]  years from now the european union will be gone and it's been politically even more fast growing
[12:29.280 --> 12:35.520]  and cancerous and more successful than the soviet union because it was able to come in through
[12:35.520 --> 12:43.680]  unesco that trump just pulled out of and control our policies unesco runs the state department
[12:43.680 --> 12:50.080]  immigrant program the un decides who comes in and trumps like seven countries don't even have
[12:50.080 --> 12:55.520]  real passports and the un says we're bringing people in from somalia and sedan and libya how
[12:55.520 --> 13:00.560]  about double hockey sticks no he double hockey sticks
[13:04.240 --> 13:07.600]  london telegraph german army plans for breakup of the european union

[13:17.120 --> 13:30.080]  that means we'd be 7.1 percent and they said we'd never even hit three it's 3.1 eat it globalist
[13:30.080 --> 13:38.480]  eat it and it doesn't mean we're out of the woods but you know what they want to fight

[22:17.680 --> 22:25.760]  one year after the historic victory celebrating all the really positive things that have happened
[22:25.760 --> 22:30.640]  in one basket we've got a big scale we're actually going to have on air and then some of the bad
[22:30.640 --> 22:34.720]  things that we haven't been able to get done yet or that trump hasn't completely delivered on
[22:34.720 --> 22:40.320]  we're going to be discussing that as well the good the bad and the ugly but this is all part
[22:40.320 --> 22:46.000]  of the negotiation uh with trump and he has basically taken the globalist to the woodshed
[22:46.000 --> 22:55.920]  so tomorrow historic transmission broadcast 8 a.m right through to the next day 6 p.m 34 hour
[22:55.920 --> 23:02.560]  continued live transmission we've made a lot of many documentaries about the first hundred days
[23:02.560 --> 23:09.040]  and the next hundred days and now 10 months in we're going to chronicle and take your phone calls
[23:09.040 --> 23:15.360]  and have special guests on and talk about all the incredibly exciting things that have happened
[23:15.360 --> 23:21.360]  all the things that have unfolded the killing of tpp the renegotiation of napta and gat 69
[23:21.360 --> 23:27.760]  percent reduction in illegals coming across the borders uh 50 plus percent more visits uh for
[23:27.760 --> 23:33.760]  uh veterans going to the va opening it up to private clinics uh the stock market up at record
[23:33.760 --> 23:40.640]  levels record new jobs coming back to the us wages being the highest they've been since 1984 a new
[23:40.640 --> 23:47.680]  job start up some of the best in u.s history consumer confidence way up all because optimism
[23:47.680 --> 23:53.680]  is back in and we believe in prosperity again and we believe in innovation again that's called the
[23:53.680 --> 24:01.840]  american system that's the flower of the enlightenment and the renaissance and it's back with donald
[24:01.840 --> 24:09.280]  john trump it's back with you it's back with me it's back with all of us and it's about optimism
[24:09.280 --> 24:14.960]  it's not about utopia it's about stopping the globalist dystopia and moving forward
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.880]  and it starts with private citizens taking care of their families and standing up for each other
[24:20.880 --> 24:25.600]  and having a real sense of community and a real sense of coming together and that's what real
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.800]  christians have and that's why globalists and communists all over the world strive to ban it
[24:31.360 --> 24:37.760]  because in southerland texas we see hispanics whites blacks folks all coming together many of
[24:37.760 --> 24:43.120]  married with children loving each other at that memorial service yesterday that brought tears in
[24:43.120 --> 24:49.040]  my eyes when i watched it last night i watched the tape of the live uh broadcast that we'd actually
[24:49.040 --> 24:55.120]  carried with elwin shroyer and it brought tears to my eyes to see these heroes coming together
[24:55.120 --> 25:01.600]  and their courage and to see them saying that they weren't heroes so let's play a clip right now
[25:02.720 --> 25:11.600]  of steven wilford who again is an nra trainer they try to claim the nra for the attack as if an
[25:11.600 --> 25:18.480]  organization is to blame for another anti for a person in a black uniform who hated god and hated
[25:18.480 --> 25:24.080]  christians and was also a pedophile we're now learning who illegally got a gun the air force
[25:24.080 --> 25:28.560]  should have transferred the files over because of his dishonorable discharge he shouldn't have
[25:28.560 --> 25:34.800]  got the gun so again the system itself from someone who was already banned from having firearms
[25:34.800 --> 25:41.680]  broke down so here ladies and gentlemen is the hero who says he wasn't a hero
[25:41.680 --> 25:49.920]  is the people at that church their friends of mine their family
[25:52.160 --> 25:58.400]  and every time i heard a shot i knew that that probably represented a life
[26:00.240 --> 26:08.880]  i was scared to death i was i was scared for me and i was scared for every one of them
[26:08.880 --> 26:13.200]  and i was scared for my own family that just lived less than a block away
[26:15.680 --> 26:20.080]  i think i got i'm no hero i am i am not
[26:22.800 --> 26:32.720]  i think my god my lord protected me and gave me the skills to do what needed to be done
[26:32.720 --> 26:39.840]  and i just wish i could have gotten there faster but i didn't know i didn't know what was happening
[26:39.840 --> 26:46.720]  and we're not blaming any of the victims but i never carried a firearm all the time until
[26:46.720 --> 26:52.240]  the last year and it's because of antifa and all the rest of these people and i get to be in the
[26:52.240 --> 26:56.640]  position that police officers are in where i am a target because the left knows who i am
[26:58.560 --> 27:01.600]  if they don't know who you are and you're a christian a conservative libertarian you
[27:01.600 --> 27:05.600]  don't get to experience it unless you have a bumper sticker or a t-shirt on but if you're a
[27:05.600 --> 27:10.320]  police officer it doesn't matter what color you are the average leftist will spit at you
[27:11.360 --> 27:16.240]  will foul false complaints on you will try to run you off the road will physically attack you
[27:16.240 --> 27:24.160]  or will shoot you in the back of your head and so i don't make that point to say oh look i'm
[27:24.160 --> 27:29.280]  this victim oh look i go through what police go through it's that i'm identifiable that the
[27:29.280 --> 27:32.560]  globalist and the leftist and their followers know who i am
[27:35.680 --> 27:40.880]  and so you don't know what that's like unless you're somebody in a uniform or who is recognizable
[27:40.880 --> 27:45.600]  and when you're recognizable you learn just how dangerous they are and it is a wake-up call
[27:45.600 --> 27:51.360]  where i carry a firearm and have security now because i have to because everybody's seen what
[27:51.360 --> 27:57.120]  they do on the streets they're animals they're crazy here's president trump talking about good
[27:57.120 --> 28:01.840]  men standing up against bad men and that good men with guns stop bad guys with guns from south
[28:01.840 --> 28:07.520]  korea here's part of it you've talked about wanting to put extreme betting on people trying to come
[28:07.520 --> 28:11.920]  into the united states but i wonder if you would consider extreme betting for people trying to buy
[28:11.920 --> 28:17.120]  a gun well you know you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much
[28:17.120 --> 28:21.280]  right now but it's okay if you feel that that's an appropriate question even though we're the
[28:21.280 --> 28:27.920]  heart of south korea if you did what you're suggesting there would have been no difference
[28:27.920 --> 28:34.880]  three days ago and you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun
[28:34.880 --> 28:44.000]  or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him and i can only say this
[28:44.000 --> 28:53.120]  if he didn't have a gun instead of having 26 dead he would have had hundreds more dead and are you
[28:53.120 --> 28:57.360]  considering any kind of gun control policy going forward because that's our president folks the

[33:53.760 --> 34:00.720]  emperor of japan he bowed to basically anybody that would give him money it was very symbolic yesterday
[34:00.720 --> 34:13.120]  when president trump met with the emperor of japan and did not bow to him and of course the emperor
[34:13.120 --> 34:19.280]  did not bow to him either it was a nice little nod of the forehead of respect like you do anybody
[34:19.280 --> 34:27.040]  impeccable ethics and etiquette and of course he did just like the japanese prime minister did
[34:27.040 --> 34:31.920]  when they first did a few scoops the koi and then dumped the whole box in that's what you do and the
[34:31.920 --> 34:39.040]  media said oh look at the ethics he's an idiot he's a moron uh he he's a fool and they zoomed in on
[34:39.040 --> 34:48.000]  the president artificially from the wide shot showing him dump the full box in and saying
[34:48.000 --> 34:55.360]  that the japanese were shocked by it lying about every angle there is and sure you're like okay they
[34:55.360 --> 35:02.960]  lied about that they'll lie about anything and everything they literally twist every angle they
[35:02.960 --> 35:08.320]  can to make our president look like a buffoon because he's actually working for you to bring
[35:08.320 --> 35:15.520]  prosperity back and cut your taxes and write the economy and cut the deficit it's just incredible
[35:15.520 --> 35:25.440]  to witness it coming up in the next segment they had congressional hearings last friday
[35:26.240 --> 35:31.680]  and i guess no one noticed until yesterday there was an article written at info wars.com
[35:35.040 --> 35:41.040]  where they have members of congress and the tech giant heads
[35:41.040 --> 35:51.120]  actually say info wars must be banned and they say yes we're trying to ban them now
[35:51.840 --> 35:58.240]  we need ai to really stop info wars i mean you cannot make it up i'm gonna play that in the next
[35:58.240 --> 36:04.320]  segment i should have started the broadcast with it what are they scared of they're scared that we're
[36:04.320 --> 36:10.320]  going to show you the full video of trump doing what the prime minister did and then we're going to
[36:10.320 --> 36:17.440]  show the video seeing in edited i mean that's why they don't like us folks it's the same reason
[36:17.440 --> 36:23.280]  they don't like drudge because drudge had the same video up yesterday showing how they lied
[36:24.560 --> 36:30.560]  they just don't want us there and there's a famous emom that did warn deblazio in person and it
[36:30.560 --> 36:35.120]  rallies that islamists were planning truck attacks he's been all over fox news you name it
[36:35.120 --> 36:42.560]  they say that's the fake news that paul watson wrote about and that they want it banned
[36:44.080 --> 36:49.680]  and then the head of technology for twitter says yes we're working on stopping info wars
[36:52.560 --> 36:59.280]  and then there's links to videos and tweets of the emom on fox news warning deblazio i mean
[36:59.280 --> 37:08.480]  that's coming up next segment it's coming up next i mean i'm gonna play these videos it's astounding
[37:11.920 --> 37:18.240]  before i go any further if they can shut us up they can shut you up and i know i say that every
[37:18.240 --> 37:22.480]  hour or so because it's true and without you remembering info wars and without you
[37:23.120 --> 37:26.960]  financially supporting us and supporting our local affiliates and buying the products
[37:26.960 --> 37:31.760]  we're not going to be here because they're coming after us and they're trying to block us everywhere

[39:48.000 --> 40:00.160]  said the usual suspects have come out people like pierce morgan and demonize the texas attorney general
[40:00.160 --> 40:03.200]  that said he believes we don't need more gun control because what we need is law abiding
[40:03.200 --> 40:08.640]  sentences to be armed so that when crazy psychopaths occasionally do what we're seeing happen good
[40:08.640 --> 40:13.360]  people are able to stand up against them and believe me folks if you research the data as we've done
[40:13.360 --> 40:22.400]  you see the evidence uh that paddock and this latest creature kelly our crypto atheist devil
[40:22.400 --> 40:29.440]  worshipper scumbag types who as usual i said are connected to pedophilia uh now paddock's
[40:29.440 --> 40:36.000]  brother's been arrested for child porn the other one for drug dealing now it's come out that kelly
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.680]  was a pedophile had been caught being a pedophile and also it fractured his wife's child's skull
[40:42.400 --> 40:48.160]  the air force didn't do its job and send forward the the file to the fbi into the database the next
[40:48.160 --> 40:52.640]  database he would have been barred from buying firearms uh so he was illegal for him to own guns
[40:53.520 --> 40:58.400]  and so that's all confirmed today but what makes me sick about pierce morgan is he has
[40:58.400 --> 41:03.760]  armed response at his la home that's been confirmed project veritas showed an armed van that drives
[41:03.760 --> 41:08.960]  around with guys with semi-automatic shotguns and rifles in front of his house and he's got body

[49:04.640 --> 49:10.080]  and i saw it during the show and i was aware we were brought up during the hearings last friday
[49:10.640 --> 49:15.920]  but i i hadn't read the transcript or watched large segments of it because i'm used to congress
[49:15.920 --> 49:19.920]  and mainstream media and the globalists you know lying about us and saying we should be shut up
[49:20.560 --> 49:24.080]  they're just trying to get us all conditioned to the fact that oh we're gonna ban your free speech
[49:24.080 --> 49:28.800]  and just shut you up or put you in prison for no reason how's that sound and they've even kind
[49:28.800 --> 49:32.480]  of gotten me comfortable with it like oh those are the gallows you're building for me you're
[49:32.480 --> 49:36.560]  gonna march me up there and hang me you're gonna bring me a six pack of beer first right
[49:37.920 --> 49:42.880]  i mean that's how crazy this is and then i started watching the videos and then i started
[49:42.880 --> 49:48.320]  reading the transcripts and this went on for hours i'm gonna play just two short clips for you
[49:48.320 --> 50:00.240]  right now in the interest of time and it is truly unbelievable they have congressman wiggly
[50:00.240 --> 50:10.400]  wiggly you can't make that up from illinois to me he just looks like the son of denis hasker just
[50:10.400 --> 50:16.000]  just saying just looks just like him talks just like him has the same effect just just saying
[50:16.000 --> 50:23.760]  just saying just saying you know he's creepy looking dude but the point is he's also involved
[50:23.760 --> 50:28.400]  in all sorts of globalist operations he is a creepy person uh when it comes to assaulting
[50:28.400 --> 50:36.560]  our bill of rights and our constitution and mr pigley wiggly gets up there with the heads of
[50:36.560 --> 50:42.960]  google twitter and facebook the actual heads of operations and boy these guys aren't spooks i'm
[50:42.960 --> 50:47.360]  a monkey's uncle i mean these are intelligence operatives right out of langley baby and right
[50:47.360 --> 50:54.160]  out of the nsa so he's got government operatives right in front of him in the tech operations
[50:54.160 --> 50:59.840]  that trump's about to break up with antitrust operations against these these these foreign
[50:59.840 --> 51:06.960]  globalist satellites that have gotten control of our country and he says info wars put out fake news
[51:06.960 --> 51:12.400]  that's everywhere and what are we going to do about it and they go on to say yes we know it's fake
[51:12.400 --> 51:17.840]  we want to get rid of it we're working with ai artificial intelligence to shut down free speech
[51:17.840 --> 51:23.120]  so they're making the internet a human free zone more and more if you don't go on with the machine
[51:23.120 --> 51:28.400]  minders want they censor you imagine a science fiction book by isek azamoth where that's happening
[51:30.240 --> 51:34.960]  oh the public would never put up with that i robot but they will hear in the real world
[51:35.760 --> 51:42.000]  so what did they say was the fake news imam i warned deblazio about new york city terror
[51:42.000 --> 51:48.880]  he was too busy bashing trump the imam want to get on mohammed tawahidi has been all over
[51:48.880 --> 51:53.680]  fox all over everywhere all over talk radio he's gone and spoken to blazio on television
[51:53.680 --> 51:58.160]  he's warning he's had demonstrations he's gone and shown the moss that would do it we have the
[51:58.160 --> 52:04.320]  videos and the tweets in the article by paul joseph Watson like let's put that on screen please and
[52:04.320 --> 52:11.040]  for tv viewers uh so we can scroll through it so this is a well-known guy that's all over television
[52:11.040 --> 52:17.440]  very credible been part of bbc documentaries uh you name it it's what he does is he goes around
[52:17.440 --> 52:21.840]  to mosque and he identifies who's calling for violence and he tells the police and then of
[52:21.840 --> 52:25.840]  course he was right turned out ices a month before was taking photos the very guy of what he was
[52:25.840 --> 52:33.040]  planning he brought 28 members of his family in on and on and on how do they respond they say
[52:33.040 --> 52:38.960]  we're fake news need to be shut down and then use this as an example of fake news when all we did
[52:38.960 --> 52:45.520]  was report on a public figure who's on record traveling to london england new york new york
[52:45.520 --> 52:53.440]  australia you name it showing the mosque for a decade and he's been on tv warning to blazio
[52:53.440 --> 52:58.240]  you have terrorists in new york months ago it was on fox news he's been on sean hennedy saying
[52:58.240 --> 53:04.480]  they're gonna attack with trucks it's coming we've said that it happens it's the very visa program
[53:04.480 --> 53:10.400]  that trumps killed that brought him in we're proven right and in their alchemy they have the tech heads
[53:10.400 --> 53:16.880]  up there admitting that they're trying to censor us defaming us and saying we're fake news but then
[53:16.880 --> 53:21.760]  a congressman comes back a republican congressman didn't know who this guy was very well but i love
[53:21.760 --> 53:25.840]  him now and says wait a minute this article you mentioned they're just reporting on somebody's
[53:25.840 --> 53:31.760]  tweets how is that fake news and they can't say he goes yeah you can't say because it's not
[53:33.520 --> 53:37.360]  because that congressman's going away and i've seen this email on tv warning new york and
[53:37.360 --> 53:41.360]  warning the chicago and warning deerfield michigan they're like wait a minute we've all heard this
[53:41.360 --> 53:50.800]  guy warn everybody with info wars is real info wars is next year's news today that's why we're
[53:50.800 --> 53:56.880]  hated so let's start getting to these clips let's go to the first first clip here of pigley wiggly
[53:56.880 --> 54:02.880]  lawmaker demands twitter censor info wars here's congressman mike quigley here it is let's look
[54:02.880 --> 54:10.720]  at unpaid content for a second uh sometimes these fake accounts are pulled down but the fake story
[54:12.240 --> 54:16.960]  takes the false claims of widespread voter fraud for example generated by these accounts
[54:16.960 --> 54:22.400]  have spread thousands and thousands of times often picked up by legitimate news accounts and
[54:22.400 --> 54:28.240]  and harvard disconfirmed flag that what do you sense more illegals voted before anything even said
[54:28.240 --> 54:34.560]  let me just notice this that if we're asking is are we still in this situation
[54:36.640 --> 54:42.720]  that was just a short time ago and i'm talking about when this meeting started on twitter if you
[54:42.720 --> 54:49.280]  clicked on the hashtag nyc terrorist attack which is quote trending marked with a red
[54:50.080 --> 54:57.120]  button saying quote live the top tweet links to an info wars story with the headline and mom
[54:57.120 --> 55:02.320]  i warned de blasio about new york city of terror he was too busy bashing trump
[55:04.480 --> 55:12.240]  this is a real time example of when we talk about this information being weaponized look at the
[55:12.240 --> 55:18.720]  feign to confirm quickly can you act and what's your responsibility to set the record straight
[55:18.720 --> 55:25.440]  so that the people who saw this know that it's fake news and at least at some point in time it
[55:25.440 --> 55:30.960]  can't keep spreading like some sort of virus through legitimate world virus that's something
[55:30.960 --> 55:35.520]  we're thinking about all the time because it's it's a bad user experience and we we don't want to
[55:35.520 --> 55:43.520]  be known as a platform for that in your example for for instance this this code just says we're fake
[55:44.880 --> 55:51.680]  when we're linked to news articles and tweets and videos of the imam on fox all over everybody
[55:51.680 --> 55:57.440]  knows who he is saying watch out there they got terrorists getting ready to hit new york with cars
[55:58.320 --> 56:03.120]  and then we're proving right and then he just goes to twitter google and facebook and they go oh
[56:03.120 --> 56:07.840]  don't worry we're trying to shut them down and next they say we're going to use ai to do it
[56:07.840 --> 56:10.720]  then we have to go to break we're going to come back and then i'm going to play the other congressman
[56:10.720 --> 56:16.720]  the republican going this story is real everybody knows about this so again they're trying to pull
[56:16.720 --> 56:23.600]  a fast one here here it is and for instance the system self-corrected that's not that shouldn't be
[56:23.600 --> 56:27.840]  the first tweet you see anymore should be a usa article the last time i checked okay pause again
[56:27.840 --> 56:33.360]  sorry sorry this is so phenomenal back it up 10 seconds the system self-corrected yeah we're
[56:33.360 --> 56:38.800]  number one because we're the most interesting we tell the truth they whack us down the system

[1:00:11.680 --> 1:00:19.440]  by self-rule that government by an elite group is superior to government for by and other people
[1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.680]  if you've been successful you don't you didn't get there on your own
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:37.120]  if you've got a business that you didn't build that somebody else made that happen
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:44.720]  you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government is nothing more than some
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:50.480]  separate sinister entities that's at the root of all our problems they'll warn that tyranny is
[1:00:50.480 --> 1:00:53.920]  always lurking just around the corner you should reject these voices
[1:00:53.920 --> 1:01:10.640]  we cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives
[1:01:10.640 --> 1:01:16.640]  that we've set we've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:27.120]  just as strong just as well funded the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:37.840]  so they have the heads of operations for google twitter and facebook
[1:01:37.840 --> 1:01:48.720]  in the house intelligence committee last week and congressman wiggly says info wars puts
[1:01:48.720 --> 1:01:53.440]  out fake news about election theft they're now admitting that illy re stole the nomination
[1:01:53.440 --> 1:02:03.040]  from sanders something we broke they're now admitting 5.7 million illegals voted not the 3.3
[1:02:03.040 --> 1:02:09.600]  like prompt was saying harvard now is confirmed but then they go into saying that de blasio hasn't
[1:02:09.600 --> 1:02:16.640]  been coddling terrorist or that imams didn't warn de blasio the attack was coming and you've
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:20.640]  got the tech heads saying we want you to have a good user experience that's what we're gonna censor
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:25.840]  they don't even say we're fake they just say oh we have a good experience and live in a cult
[1:02:25.840 --> 1:02:30.800]  and live in la la land and later they say we're working on ai to just automate and shut down info
[1:02:30.800 --> 1:02:36.720]  wars here it is shouldn't be the first tweet you see anymore should be a usa article the last time
[1:02:36.720 --> 1:02:43.200]  i checked um but you saw this you at usa today at lunch i did yeah and this and i also saw the system
[1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:49.120]  system corrected uh can you can you give me a really good guess of how long it was top
[1:02:50.880 --> 1:02:55.040]  we can we can follow up with you and your staff on that and i don't have the stat in front of me
[1:02:55.040 --> 1:03:01.040]  uh so i don't know but we're like we said earlier trying to balance you know free speech with
[1:03:01.680 --> 1:03:06.320]  making the the information you see on the system especially around trends that we direct
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:13.120]  trends that they direct now let's go to the republican congressman chris stewart of utah
[1:03:13.760 --> 1:03:18.960]  came to the defense of info wars and free speech here it is we have used the term fake news
[1:03:18.960 --> 1:03:24.960]  news we've it's been used pervasively in this hearing uh and i and we all recognize that fake
[1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:28.960]  news is in the eye of the beholder many times there are some things that are reported that are
[1:03:28.960 --> 1:03:36.000]  demonstrably untrue but the vast majority of it is some spectrum there of opinion and reality
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.440]  and i'll use mr quigley's example he said for example and i'm as i best recall amon warns the
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:46.880]  blasio he ignored it because he was too busy criticizing trump well there's an element of
[1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:52.240]  both in there perhaps him on did warn the blasio we don't know that yet he did and and whether he
[1:03:52.240 --> 1:03:57.840]  was too busy criticizing trump to some degree is a matter of opinion now to my friend mr quigley
[1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:03.120]  and i don't mean this as a criticism i mean to him that's fake news someone else read that and they
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:10.880]  see legitimate critic critique in there how in the world do you uh do you intend to identify fake
[1:04:10.880 --> 1:04:17.040]  news without weaponizing this in the political realm because as i said there is an enormous
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:22.080]  degree of opinion included in almost every bit of that and if you're viewed as being political in
[1:04:22.080 --> 1:04:26.800]  this and it's my fear that you will be regardless of what you do if you're viewed as being political
[1:04:26.800 --> 1:04:32.320]  then it's not monitoring fake news it's weaponizing it and it's editorializing it and the best example
[1:04:32.320 --> 1:04:39.600]  that is simply the fact checking fact checking is as an opinionated many times as as as anything else
[1:04:39.600 --> 1:04:45.520]  that we see and i've got 24 seconds you can't answer that so i'm going to express my fear of it uh but
[1:04:46.400 --> 1:04:49.520]  if you have a very quick response would be interested in what that might be
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:59.760]  i don't blame you for remaining silent with that you understand protect your skin with spf 30

[1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:15.600]  on for your mind i remember when i remember i remember when i lost my mind so last week they
[1:06:15.600 --> 1:06:21.200]  had the house intelligence committee hearings where the tech giants even had to admit that
[1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:28.000]  actually the russian bots were a bunch of different companies and a lot of them were
[1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:34.400]  leftist groups that were actually anti-trump the others were neutral and were only trying to get
[1:06:34.400 --> 1:06:41.760]  traffic to their news stories they were just inflammatory and they were less than one percent
[1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:49.360]  of the entire aggregate of traffic during the election but then i learned yesterday that during
[1:06:49.360 --> 1:07:00.240]  the hearings there was a story on info wars.com they came out and said that we made up a fake
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:13.200]  news story that a prominent emom had warned deblazio that radical islamists in isis were
[1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:16.880]  planning truck attacks well isis put out videos a year ago they've been doing it all over the
[1:07:16.880 --> 1:07:24.560]  world and there's the article they say fake news i warned deblazio about new york city terror
[1:07:24.560 --> 1:07:32.320]  but he was too busy bashing trump they have the heads of the tech companies on and they say sir
[1:07:32.320 --> 1:07:36.960]  yeah we're working on censoring info wars we saw that fake story we had our artificial
[1:07:36.960 --> 1:07:43.200]  you know computer system shut it down and you can go watch the whole hearing they talk about ai
[1:07:43.200 --> 1:07:48.640]  in the future controlling it here's the story video dim lawmaker demands twitter censor info wars
[1:07:49.440 --> 1:07:52.960]  but then the republican i'm gonna play this clip and go to our guests it all ties together
[1:07:54.400 --> 1:08:01.120]  chris steward of utah says well that's opinion on whether or not this emom warned him that's not
[1:08:01.120 --> 1:08:06.320]  fake news but it's not even that that this emom is famous he's been over fox news
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:12.880]  we've already covered that in detail warning that this attack was coming
[1:08:14.480 --> 1:08:19.840]  emom muhammad towahiti he's famous he goes to the mosque he gives examples of what are being
[1:08:19.840 --> 1:08:25.840]  preached of course everybody said truck attacks are coming to nyc look what's happened in paris and
[1:08:25.840 --> 1:08:34.480]  nissan israel and russia i mean they call it fake news to say we're letting people in
[1:08:34.480 --> 1:08:39.120]  that are gonna attack us when this guy was led in by obama on one of these visa programs that
[1:08:39.120 --> 1:08:46.880]  trump's trying to kill and they call that fake news incredible so again here's the clip of the
[1:08:46.880 --> 1:08:51.600]  congressman then we're gonna go to our guests and this all ties into the war on trump the war
[1:08:51.600 --> 1:08:56.480]  in america that's so desperate by the deep state but here is the congressman checking their propaganda
[1:08:56.960 --> 1:09:01.760]  we have used the term fake news we've it's been used pervasively in this hearing
[1:09:01.760 --> 1:09:07.280]  uh and i and we all recognize that fake news is in the eye of the beholder many times there are
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:13.280]  some things that are reported that are demonstrably untrue but the vast majority of it is some
[1:09:13.280 --> 1:09:19.040]  spectrum there of opinion and reality and i'll use mr quigley's example he said for example and i'm
[1:09:19.040 --> 1:09:25.680]  as i best recall iman warns deblazio he ignored it because he was too busy criticizing trump
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:30.080]  well there's an element of both in there perhaps iman did warn deblazio we don't know that yet
[1:09:30.080 --> 1:09:36.800]  and and whether he was too busy criticizing trump to some degree is a matter of opinion now to my
[1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:41.840]  friend mr quigley and i don't mean this as a criticism i mean to him that's fake news someone
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:48.240]  else read that and they see legitimate critic critique in there how in the world do you uh do
[1:09:48.240 --> 1:09:55.360]  you intend to identify fake news without weaponizing this in the political realm because as i said there
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:01.280]  is an enormous degree of opinion included in almost every bit of that and if you're viewed as being
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:05.600]  political in this and it's my fear that you will be regardless of what you do and they are if you're
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:10.720]  viewed as being political then it's not monitoring fake news it's weaponizing it and it's editorializing
[1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:16.880]  it and the best example that is simply the fact checking fact checking is as an opinionated many
[1:10:16.880 --> 1:10:22.960]  times as as as anything else that we see and i've got 24 seconds you can't answer that so i'm going
[1:10:22.960 --> 1:10:29.360]  to express my fear of it but if you have a very quick response i'd be interested in what that might be
[1:10:32.720 --> 1:10:36.880]  i don't blame you for remaining silent you understand the why we're concerned about that
[1:10:36.880 --> 1:10:42.240]  and the challenge and we want to help you on that but uh we live in a political world already i hope
[1:10:42.240 --> 1:10:47.120]  we make a less political they need to be busted up they're antitrust they're like he's over been
[1:10:47.120 --> 1:10:50.960]  threatened to attack and kill everybody but if you call somebody a liar they shut you down
[1:10:50.960 --> 1:10:56.400]  of you're a conservative a christian libertarian joining us is ebbard Klein a distinguished journalist
[1:10:56.400 --> 1:11:01.360]  a best-selling author i'm not going to go over his whole whole background with newark daily news
[1:11:01.360 --> 1:11:06.240]  and you name it uh he's of course been with the times as well he's written a many articles for
[1:11:06.240 --> 1:11:11.840]  vanity fair a lot of other publications ebbardcline.com is his website he's got the new book out
[1:11:11.840 --> 1:11:17.840]  all out war the plot to destroy trump and that's what it is it's all out war i've never seen
[1:11:17.840 --> 1:11:24.720]  such deception such viciousness and it's only getting more insane uh as as it appears they're
[1:11:24.720 --> 1:11:30.080]  going to lose but that that's the perfect title it's true how is this all out war and uh where
[1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:37.520]  does it end number one new york times best-selling author ed Klein. Alex it all began on a specific
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:46.960]  date we can actually put a date on it december 16 2016 six weeks after donald trump won the election
[1:11:46.960 --> 1:11:54.880]  oracle obama michelle obama and their consigliary valerie jarrett invite susan reiss the national
[1:11:54.880 --> 1:12:01.760]  security advisor to dinner in the white house and susan reiss convinces the president obama at that
[1:12:01.760 --> 1:12:10.720]  time to unmask the names of donald trump associates who were inadvertently picked up in nsa uh
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:17.440]  intercepts unmask their names so they became public distribute them widely through the intelligence
[1:12:17.440 --> 1:12:22.320]  community among hundreds of not thousands of people and make sure they're leaked to the press
[1:12:22.320 --> 1:12:30.560]  and that's where this cockamamie story this false narrative is they call it of collusion
[1:12:30.560 --> 1:12:37.760]  began right in the obama white house and now it's it's thousands of times the size of watergate
[1:12:37.760 --> 1:12:42.640]  they've all lied to congress they've lied to the people it's illegal uh we found out the
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:46.800]  democrats are up in their eyeballs with the russians everything they said trump did they've
[1:12:46.800 --> 1:12:51.600]  done the only guy i guess not in bed with the russians is trump uh know what are their fighting
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.880]  so hard because they're fighting for their lives well they are fighting for their lives and and
[1:12:56.880 --> 1:13:05.680]  you know we have in this new book that i've written all that war an fbi report that confirms what i
[1:13:05.680 --> 1:13:11.200]  think you and a lot of other people have been saying for quite a while which is that there is a deep
[1:13:11.200 --> 1:13:19.600]  state and that these rogue elements inside the permanent bureaucracy of the government are doing
[1:13:19.600 --> 1:13:26.400]  everything they can to sabotage donald trump's agenda and the agenda in my view of the american
[1:13:26.400 --> 1:13:37.040]  people that these deep state people these permanent employees who aside with clinton and obama are
[1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:44.960]  are deleting files from computers losing files slow walking regulations and leaking to the press
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:51.680]  and doing everything they can to undo this effort on the part of the president to make america great
[1:13:51.680 --> 1:13:58.800]  again what's their next move i mean it appears they're losing i mean it appears that robert
[1:13:58.800 --> 1:14:04.960]  mueller's the one that ought to be indicted for russia ties with handing iranium off on tar max to the
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:12.960]  fsb hillary getting all this money and this is beyond any tom clancy novel it really is you
[1:14:12.960 --> 1:14:18.000]  can't make this stuff up as you just said well you know one of the uh things in this new book
[1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:26.560]  all out war the plot to destroy trump that i have put into the book i've reproduced not one but two
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:34.240]  secret fbi reports one on the deep state which we've just talked about and another on the connection
[1:14:34.240 --> 1:14:42.720]  between the radical left wing of violent groups like antifa and others that are spread throughout
[1:14:42.720 --> 1:14:48.640]  college communities in the united states the connection between these left wing groups violent
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:55.120]  left wing groups and the islamic state and al qaeda and fbi agents went to europe and actually
[1:14:55.920 --> 1:15:01.520]  infiltrated and watched and recorded these meetings that took place in europe and in syria
[1:15:02.080 --> 1:15:08.800]  between these americans who are getting instructions on how to make bombs how to deal with toxic
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:15.280]  chemicals use toxic chemicals as weapons the very scary stuff and the fbi says in the secret
[1:15:15.280 --> 1:15:22.400]  report that i've printed this is the greatest challenge to law enforcement since the 1970s
[1:15:22.400 --> 1:15:27.280]  and the weather underground i totally agree i can't wait to read the book because just reading
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:31.120]  the synopsis i've learned some things and they're going to look them up they were actually true i
[1:15:31.120 --> 1:15:36.240]  didn't even know that there's documents with the left even sees ices as their army but i
[1:15:36.240 --> 1:15:40.640]  but i guess if you watch the news they see radical islam as their army and it just shows
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:45.120]  that they've radicalized the point of being unrecognizable from the democratic party of
[1:15:45.120 --> 1:15:49.440]  just 10 years ago i want to ask you where you think all this is going and some of the other

[1:19:58.800 --> 1:20:10.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:36.800]  all right folks alex jones here back live one more segment and i'm gonna up the phones up after our guest leaves us for the callers and cover a bunch of other news that's unfolding all out war the plot to destroy trump and clients new book set to be a bestseller undoubtedly you know steven bannon understands its total war I point out it's an info war but I can't go out on the streets now in san francisco or austin or
[1:20:36.800 --> 1:20:56.800]  Seattle without people running up throwing coffee at me attacking me they celebrate when there's Islamic attacks they celebrate when churches get attacked the left celebrates when bombs go off in israel I mean you see it now and they've gone from just tacitly covering it up to promoting it and then we point out how they're promoting it
[1:20:56.800 --> 1:21:10.800]  they go oh no we're not that's fake news so there's been a total radicalization why do you have the term all out war and flesh out what's in the book is that people may think they know it all they don't this is that everybody needs to read and understand because people have to know what they're in if you're just a normal
[1:21:10.800 --> 1:21:27.800]  conservative or christian or libertarian or just common sense person you're not a public figure you don't know what donald trump goes through you don't know what I go through and I'm not trying to say I go through anything when his family does the their vicious their bullies their frothing I mean I've seen old film reels
[1:21:27.800 --> 1:21:41.800]  people getting beat up in communist countries they weren't communist or in nazi germany if they were you know trade unionists or jewish and you know hitting family slapping them in the head that I'm not trying to compare what has happened to me to that bad but it's approaching
[1:21:41.800 --> 1:22:03.800]  1934 1935 germany in the way conservatives and people are being treated in my experience and client you're so right about that alex you know I live here in new york city and many many years ago I was an editor at the new york times when the times was still a straight newspaper which of course it hasn't been for a long time
[1:22:03.800 --> 1:22:15.800]  and all my friends here in new york ninety percent of whom are are liberals have gone so far as to not only
[1:22:15.800 --> 1:22:34.800]  shun me but if they meet me in a restaurant or on street they don't even acknowledge me they won't even say hello to me I have friends of decades and they were friends who tell me that they don't want to have anything more to do with me it's like the religious wars in the 17th century
[1:22:34.800 --> 1:22:54.800]  when people burn each other at the stakes because of their religious differences here in this country we're having the same kind of religious war if you will between progressives on the left so-called progressives and conservatives like you and me on the right
[1:22:54.800 --> 1:23:21.800]  what's going to happen if in 2018 which is just around the corner of course the democrats get control of the house of representatives that's what this whole war against trump is aimed at getting control of the house of representatives so that the first thing they will do is put forth impeachment proceedings against this president
[1:23:21.800 --> 1:23:39.800]  and it's just crazy to see all the footage of them beating up reporters antifa will just attack even mainstream news police they're just frothing and so filled with hate do you think they're going to get more degenerate more insane before they get better or as a historian and a smart guy where do you see this going
[1:23:39.800 --> 1:24:08.800]  I think it's going to get a lot worse because we're moving into the midterm elections when so much is at stake I guess you can hear in the background the typical New York sounds of sirens those are generally ambulances not police but sometimes they're police and come 2018 the democrats are going to be desperate to get control of the house of representatives in the senate
[1:24:08.800 --> 1:24:29.800]  what will that mean in terms of this war that we're talking about this this bitter underhanded lies and deceit that we see on the left it's going to get a lot worse in fact I believe that you're going to see a lot more violence on the left because as you know these groups like antifa and other violent
[1:24:29.800 --> 1:24:46.800]  groups say that they like violence they even consider themselves and proud of the fact that they're communists and they're socialists and they say violence is a good thing it's the only way they say the left can get back and that's the grassroots then you've got the big telecoms and the big tech companies
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:25:00.800]  openly admitting their censoring libertarians conservatives they want to take the president's twitter away it's just open authoritarian censorship really trying to organize itself but they're losing every special election looks like they'll lose the Virginia
[1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:17.800]  governor ship and as you said that just makes them get more radicalized and drives people away from them but they don't ever learn they just get worse well you could argue if I can say talk to you about this this noise outside oh it's fine it adds to the atmosphere
[1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:38.800]  okay you could argue that the further left and nutty they get the more like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders and the antifa group they get the better in some ways it will be for conservatives because you're so right between the left coast and the right coast of this country the so-called
[1:25:38.800 --> 1:25:53.800]  this is around the real America real Americans don't buy this luckily stuff you know that so you're a I mean a guy that's well known for them to predict a lot of things that are unfolding and we're not looking at a crystal ball here but
[1:25:53.800 --> 1:26:09.800]  barring assassination I don't say the economy's coming back people are really turning against the control left I just see trumping a very successful president one of the most successful ever globally globalism and authoritarian leftist garbage is in trouble I mean can't they see the
[1:26:09.800 --> 1:26:27.800]  massive trend I don't see they don't want to see this massive trend we're now at what 3.1% growth in this country yes to the whole at least percentage point ahead of Obama and we're probably going to do a lot better we've got 70 we've stopped 70% of the illegal
[1:26:27.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  crossings in the southern border we're getting to the energy independent thank you thank you Donald Trump and now he's on this Asian tour which if you look at the mainstream media they're almost ignoring because they can see that he and
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:51.800]  America are more respected today in Asia than they ever were in the eight years of Barack Obama.
[1:26:51.800 --> 1:27:07.800]  And the Congressional Budget Office predicts that if we get the house tax cut combined with this growth rate we're looking at a 7.1 growth rate within two years I mean they and then they're fighting to the nail openly to stop it calling it a nightmare.
[1:27:07.800 --> 1:27:27.800]  And what could be better if I may just digress for a second than a five six percent seven percent growth rate for the minorities in this country that it will be the average everyday American who will benefit from this growth rate there finally they'll get good paying jobs
[1:27:27.800 --> 1:27:40.800]  you'll get raises they'll be able to reinstate what we've lost the American dream which is that our kids and our grandkids can look forward to living an even better life than we do.
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:54.800]  Well please come back again as this all unfolds I can't wait to read the book I've ordered one course it's all out war the plot to destroy Trump you're dead on and I'm going to learn a lot so thank you for being a watchman on the wall and have a good week coming up.
[1:27:54.800 --> 1:28:09.800]  Thank you so much Alex thank you folks we are in deep deep trouble good things are happening but bad things are happening and I want to be confident in all this but the same time we've got to know they're getting more and more violent more and more deranged and I'm here to tell you.
[1:28:09.800 --> 1:28:28.800]  The left has talked about doing false flags they've gotten smart like Vegas or like what we saw here in Texas a pedophile atheist Christian hater who beats up his family and what these are all about being selfish pigs and it's always the same MO of all these people.
[1:28:28.800 --> 1:28:40.800]  And it happened again and then they blame us the second they blame the NRA and it turns out it's an NRA trainer who took the scumbag out.

[1:29:59.800 --> 1:30:06.800]  Why is this so good because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:11.800]  I mean I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[1:30:11.800 --> 1:30:23.800]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[1:30:23.800 --> 1:30:26.800]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.

[1:30:56.800 --> 1:30:59.800]  America is an information based civil war.
[1:30:59.800 --> 1:31:07.800]  That's why now more than ever we've got to hit the streets of America and let these globalists scum know we're not backing down from their bully.

[1:31:13.800 --> 1:31:21.800]  Being a conservative a nationalist a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[1:31:21.800 --> 1:31:29.800]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America pro-capitalism and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant.
[1:31:29.800 --> 1:31:34.800]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's classical liberalism.

[1:33:37.800 --> 1:33:40.800]  You want to talk about sickening rejection.
[1:33:40.800 --> 1:33:44.800]  There's a Newsweek article out.
[1:33:44.800 --> 1:33:53.800]  Attacking myself certain of it to everybody else saying why is the right obsessed with pedophilia.
[1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:55.800]  Newsweek of course is on the verge of going bankrupt.
[1:33:55.800 --> 1:33:58.800]  It's laid off half their people because they're fake news.
[1:33:58.800 --> 1:34:02.800]  They're about as bad as it gets.
[1:34:02.800 --> 1:34:05.800]  I'm obsessed with Americana.
[1:34:05.800 --> 1:34:10.800]  And we are exposing the pedophile rings in Hollywood in DC.
[1:34:10.800 --> 1:34:14.800]  Like the deputy pope.
[1:34:14.800 --> 1:34:16.800]  The deputy pope.
[1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:22.800]  Who just got arrested for reportedly corralling over 100 kids for sex.
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:26.800]  And all the underage stuff with Kevin Spacey and the rest of it.
[1:34:26.800 --> 1:34:30.800]  And then Newsweek brings up Comet ping pong pizza again.
[1:34:30.800 --> 1:34:36.800]  That time magazine the New York Times the Washington Post CNN all put on the radar.
[1:34:36.800 --> 1:34:41.800]  During the podesta emails that are very creepy had nothing to do with Comet ping pong.
[1:34:41.800 --> 1:34:48.800]  The media focused on it where Podesta did go and eat some and his brother had fundraisers made it all about that.
[1:34:48.800 --> 1:34:51.800]  Put this info out in the press.
[1:34:51.800 --> 1:34:58.800]  The media made it the spotlight to then say there's no such thing as pedophilia in the world basically.
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:01.800]  So it was a false flag controlled demolition.
[1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:07.800]  A diversion from all of Jerry Epstein's behavior and Weiner who just went to prison yesterday.
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:12.800]  Just heard about his sentence for going after an underage girl and all the rest of it.
[1:35:12.800 --> 1:35:17.800]  And Nickelodeon and the media sexualizing children and all the admissions.
[1:35:17.800 --> 1:35:22.800]  Dennis Hastert the former speaker of the house.
[1:35:22.800 --> 1:35:26.800]  Nambla all over the place trying to get pedophilia legalized.
[1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:30.800]  The schools sexualizing children.
[1:35:30.800 --> 1:35:36.800]  And then they hang their whole hat on pizza gate.
[1:35:36.800 --> 1:35:44.800]  The FBI has manuals about pizza used as codes and Italian food used in codes by pedophiles.
[1:35:44.800 --> 1:35:46.800]  Cheese pizza means child pornography.
[1:35:46.800 --> 1:35:50.800]  And it was all in there about $65,000 of succulent hot dogs and oh these are the best.
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:54.800]  Well they weren't good that last time but this time they'll be good and they'll be brown sauce.
[1:35:54.800 --> 1:35:56.800]  Well I don't want too many nuts on the sauce.
[1:35:56.800 --> 1:36:02.800]  Are these nuts really good and we'll have the kids for your pleasure in the hot tub.
[1:36:02.800 --> 1:36:05.800]  Well are the kids going to be fun?
[1:36:05.800 --> 1:36:09.800]  Well yeah there's still kids though.
[1:36:09.800 --> 1:36:15.800]  I mean we'll have blood and semen for you in the ritual for you to drink.
[1:36:15.800 --> 1:36:18.800]  And it's an Aleister Crowley high priestess.
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:25.800]  I mean and so that's all going on and then all of a sudden the mainstream media goes look at Comet ping pong pizza.
[1:36:25.800 --> 1:36:28.800]  And I go to Cancun for a week with my family and I see us reporting on it.
[1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:31.800]  And I watch a bunch of it and I go a lot of that.
[1:36:31.800 --> 1:36:36.800]  Really sounds crazy and but everything I go I think this is a setup by the media focusing on it.
[1:36:36.800 --> 1:36:39.800]  But there's not a basement in that place and I said we'll see.
[1:36:39.800 --> 1:36:43.800]  I even had a few crew members kind of Alex I can't believe you're covering up.
[1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:46.800]  And I said listen every GD one of these is going down.
[1:36:46.800 --> 1:36:54.800]  And I said I said I know there's people there on video at the pizza place talking about how they like kids at the open mic.
[1:36:54.800 --> 1:36:56.800]  Whatever that's some rock band that was there.
[1:36:56.800 --> 1:37:01.800]  The real stuff is the sex traveling out of Haiti and the AP reports and all this other stuff.
[1:37:01.800 --> 1:37:07.800]  The media is wanting us like a mockingbird will act like its wings broken to get you away from its nest.
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:10.800]  And of course I was proven right again.
[1:37:10.800 --> 1:37:13.800]  Then I did the right thing and say yes that was wrong info.
[1:37:13.800 --> 1:37:17.800]  We report on people's reports and the media makes it like I made everything up.
[1:37:17.800 --> 1:37:22.800]  And then I'm this horrible person when I'm the one that caught it and cleaned it up.
[1:37:22.800 --> 1:37:25.800]  No good D goes on and punished.
[1:37:25.800 --> 1:37:34.800]  And then now I get to see the media run with this same thing how Jones and everybody made this up and it doesn't exist.
[1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:36.800]  Very shameful of Newsweek.
[1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:43.800]  New lows for you guys and there's record bus to pedophiles all over the country and record numbers of people getting caught.
[1:37:43.800 --> 1:37:48.800]  And the sex trafficking and Hollywood's going down and all of it.
[1:37:48.800 --> 1:37:59.800]  So good luck Newsweek. Good luck being apologists for what's going on.
[1:37:59.800 --> 1:38:01.800]  It's simply amazing.
[1:38:01.800 --> 1:38:06.800]  And they never tell you pizza gate is about code words and FBI manuals.
[1:38:06.800 --> 1:38:09.800]  It's always about comic ping pong, a pizza place.
[1:38:09.800 --> 1:38:19.800]  They semantically manipulate the public and then basically use their own people escape notes who aren't involved in this behavior.
[1:38:19.800 --> 1:38:23.800]  Well there's no evidence to that fact.
[1:38:23.800 --> 1:38:30.800]  But Podesta constantly tweets out that I should eat crap and then I'm pathetic and haha when he's the one in deep trouble.
[1:38:30.800 --> 1:38:36.800]  Listen I don't I've never retracted anything I said about Podesta and the emails about spirit cooking and we'll have the blood and semen ready.
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:40.800]  WikiLeaks put all that out. That's real folks.
[1:38:40.800 --> 1:38:44.800]  And what do you do when you're caught with the Russians you call the enemy Russians.
[1:38:44.800 --> 1:38:50.800]  What do you do when there's all these thousands of emails about we'll be at the farmhouse for the adult party.
[1:38:50.800 --> 1:38:56.800]  Three children these ages you know six seven and nine will be delivered to the hot tub.
[1:38:56.800 --> 1:39:01.800]  The pool is not heated but the hot tub is they will be in the hot tub waiting for you.
[1:39:01.800 --> 1:39:07.800]  Well I can't wait.
[1:39:07.800 --> 1:39:10.800]  That's what old Podesta wants to get the depositions on that one.
[1:39:10.800 --> 1:39:15.800]  What the hell's going on with the hot tub and the kids waiting there for your entertainment.
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:19.800]  That's the quote.
[1:39:19.800 --> 1:39:28.800]  And then Podesta's brother did a spread in 2007 in the Washington Post about his radical dangerous art.
[1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:36.800]  That's the quotes with images of naked children that I won't even show on air.
[1:39:36.800 --> 1:39:41.800]  Because they could selectively enforce and put me in jail for pedophilia folks.
[1:39:41.800 --> 1:39:44.800]  We're talking two year olds.
[1:39:44.800 --> 1:39:45.800]  Look at this.
[1:39:45.800 --> 1:39:48.800]  The plan to heat the pool so a swim is possible.
[1:39:48.800 --> 1:39:53.800]  Bonnie will Uber service to transport Ruby Emerson.
[1:39:53.800 --> 1:40:02.800]  Says nine and seven so you'll have some further attainment and they will be in the pool for sure.
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:04.800]  I mean it just goes on and on man.
[1:40:04.800 --> 1:40:07.800]  And all we said is what is this.
[1:40:07.800 --> 1:40:17.800]  And you're hanging around with Epstein and Bill Clinton's on the plane with Epstein and so is this creature.
[1:40:17.800 --> 1:40:22.800]  Harvey Weinstein and they've got an island where they take little kids.
[1:40:22.800 --> 1:40:27.800]  This is all confirmed and you think you're going to divert us with the pizza place.
[1:40:27.800 --> 1:40:32.800]  No you're not.
[1:40:32.800 --> 1:40:33.800]  There you go.
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:35.800]  Kevin Spacey went on that airplane too.
[1:40:35.800 --> 1:40:36.800]  He likes to have fun.
[1:40:36.800 --> 1:40:43.800]  His dad was a quote devil worshiping Nazi that raped him and his brothers and sisters.
[1:40:43.800 --> 1:40:45.800]  It's all come out.
[1:40:45.800 --> 1:40:50.800]  And I told you I said people like Spacey were used to get kids when he was a kid.
[1:40:50.800 --> 1:40:52.800]  It's always the same.
[1:40:52.800 --> 1:41:01.800]  They use well spoken good looking kids as the lure just like an angler fish does.
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:03.800]  Why is he playing good psychopath?
[1:41:03.800 --> 1:41:08.800]  Because he is a psychopath.
[1:41:08.800 --> 1:41:09.800]  So that's all coming up.
[1:41:09.800 --> 1:41:11.800]  I'm going to come back to your phone calls though.
[1:41:11.800 --> 1:41:13.800]  I've got a lot of other news to hit.
[1:41:13.800 --> 1:41:19.800]  But that's why they're coming after us folks because and I'm not at liberty to get into a lot of it this time.
[1:41:19.800 --> 1:41:26.800]  I just want everybody to understand if you want to see us stand against the enemy like a lighthouse in a storm and prevail.
[1:41:26.800 --> 1:41:28.800]  Pray for us number one.
[1:41:28.800 --> 1:41:30.800]  Spread the videos and the articles number two because that's the info war.
[1:41:30.800 --> 1:41:31.800]  That's critical.
[1:41:31.800 --> 1:41:39.800]  But number three financially commit to go to infowarstore.com and sign up for DNA force for you and your family.

[1:46:07.800 --> 1:46:13.800]  We're only intensifying our operations in the face of their wannabe dictatorship.
[1:46:13.800 --> 1:46:21.800]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:29.800]  The real punk rock is being a patriot who's pro-America, pro-capitalism and pro-freedom who at the same time is tolerant.
[1:46:29.800 --> 1:46:34.800]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's class of the liberalism.
[1:46:34.800 --> 1:46:41.800]  They are the anti-liberal. To defend free speech, meet like-minded friends and promote freedom worldwide.

[1:47:20.800 --> 1:47:26.800]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:47:26.800 --> 1:47:29.800]  We're not playing deadly winks, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:47:29.800 --> 1:47:31.800]  We're on your phone calls right now.
[1:47:31.800 --> 1:47:38.800]  Tom in London, Mark in Oregon, Zach in Florida, Alyssa in Oregon, Tau in South Carolina and many others.

[1:47:42.800 --> 1:47:45.800]  877-789-2539.
[1:47:45.800 --> 1:47:49.800]  I want to thank you all for your support. I want to thank all of our affiliates. Please remember to support them.
[1:47:49.800 --> 1:47:56.800]  And I want to thank the amazing crew surrounding me here in this great news center we've built.
[1:47:56.800 --> 1:48:00.800]  And just all my family and everybody else for what they put up with.
[1:48:00.800 --> 1:48:02.800]  But they understand we're up against bullies.
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:06.800]  And so everybody's fighting harder and stronger and more focused than ever.
[1:48:06.800 --> 1:48:18.800]  And as we begin to see victory, and as we find our will again, the enemy really tries to put their fangs out and takes the mask off.
[1:48:18.800 --> 1:48:21.800]  And boy, I didn't just confirm everything we knew.
[1:48:21.800 --> 1:48:27.800]  And it doesn't just make you 100% absolutely commit to defeating these people.
[1:48:27.800 --> 1:48:32.800]  They think their intimidation works on us. They're going to find out real good.
[1:48:32.800 --> 1:48:37.800]  They're going to find out what we're made of and what they're made of.
[1:48:37.800 --> 1:48:41.800]  We're going to get them off the backs of our children because that's who they're obsessed with.
[1:48:41.800 --> 1:48:44.800]  They want to mentally screw them up. They want to have sex with them.
[1:48:44.800 --> 1:48:49.800]  And brainwash them and turn them into them. Evil targets the youth.
[1:48:49.800 --> 1:48:53.800]  So yeah, Newsweek, we're obsessed with exposing pedophilia.
[1:48:53.800 --> 1:48:57.800]  And we're being proven right. So you keep trying to act like it isn't going on.
[1:48:57.800 --> 1:49:03.800]  As all around, people get caught running child kidnapping rings and caught with dead children and caught in cages.
[1:49:03.800 --> 1:49:11.800]  And as the deputy pope and all the Hollywood people get busted, you keep telling everybody it didn't exist.
[1:49:11.800 --> 1:49:15.800]  Hell, why don't you get in a time machine and go back and say Hitler didn't exist?
[1:49:15.800 --> 1:49:22.800]  Or Stalin? Or Mao Zedong? You jerks?
[1:49:22.800 --> 1:49:26.800]  You don't control reality anymore. You think we're 10 years ago or 20 years ago.
[1:49:26.800 --> 1:49:34.800]  You still think you got your thumb on America? Or the world? Well, guess what? You don't scum bags.
[1:49:34.800 --> 1:49:38.800]  So all that's left at places like Newsweek is the scum of the earth.
[1:49:38.800 --> 1:49:46.800]  And again, a 50% layoff this month of what was left is the scum of the scum that'll do whatever they're told.
[1:49:46.800 --> 1:49:50.800]  Well, good. Just send your race to the bottom even faster.
[1:49:50.800 --> 1:49:55.800]  Because mentally ill people like you don't ever know when to give up, do you?
[1:49:55.800 --> 1:50:00.800]  Coming up, seeing in directing employees to discredit Dona Brazil.
[1:50:00.800 --> 1:50:07.800]  Wow, what a surprise. Saudi Arabia calls missile launch an act of war with a buyer in Iran.
[1:50:07.800 --> 1:50:10.800]  We got the president over there in Asia will break that down.
[1:50:10.800 --> 1:50:15.800]  They're mounting fighter jets with pulse laser particle beam weapon systems.
[1:50:15.800 --> 1:50:18.800]  Told you they had that 20-something years ago. It's been declassified longer than that.
[1:50:18.800 --> 1:50:20.800]  But now it's powerful weapons.
[1:50:20.800 --> 1:50:25.800]  The latest on the Texas Massacre and so much more, it's all coming up.
[1:50:25.800 --> 1:50:28.800]  Oh, and one more thing before I go to your call.
[1:50:28.800 --> 1:50:31.800]  So I'll do it into the next time. I'm starting to take some right now from London.
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:35.800]  Let's play that clip I mentioned earlier. I forgot to get to Fox about 20 minutes ago during a break.
[1:50:35.800 --> 1:50:40.800]  I was getting myself a little cup of coffee here in my drudgereport.com coffee cup.
[1:50:40.800 --> 1:50:42.800]  Because we're fans around here.
[1:50:42.800 --> 1:50:51.800]  And there they were announcing that hearings, they're calling sessions in next week to grill him like he did something wrong.
[1:50:51.800 --> 1:50:59.800]  And he just sits there and takes it while they're all caught red-handed doing 10,000 times anything he supposedly ever did.
[1:50:59.800 --> 1:51:02.800]  And he just sits there and just continues.
[1:51:02.800 --> 1:51:08.800]  Fox News, all part of the fraud. Here, let's just go to it right now. Here it is.
[1:51:08.800 --> 1:51:15.800]  To alert now, we are learning Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the House Judiciary Committee next Tuesday.
[1:51:15.800 --> 1:51:19.800]  We're told it's part of a routine Justice Department oversight hearing.
[1:51:19.800 --> 1:51:25.800]  But it does come just days after Senate Democrats demanded Sessions return to Capitol Hill to clarify his statements on Russia.
[1:51:25.800 --> 1:51:29.800]  Democrats on the House panel not wasting any time after the announcement issuing a press release.
[1:51:29.800 --> 1:51:35.800]  With the title that they're putting Sessions quote on notice saying they want answers after new documents revealed
[1:51:35.800 --> 1:51:41.800]  that a former Trump campaign advisor pushed to set up a meeting between then candidate Donald Trump and Russia.
[1:51:41.800 --> 1:51:44.800]  Please.
[1:51:44.800 --> 1:51:50.800]  Papinopoulos, who was never even paid by the campaign that we now know is in deep with the Democrats,
[1:51:50.800 --> 1:51:53.800]  kept asking for the to meet with the Russians and they said no every time.
[1:51:53.800 --> 1:52:01.800]  So now the big hearings are about one low level guy who tried to get Russia meetings and was rebuffed.
[1:52:01.800 --> 1:52:08.800]  That'd be like saying you drove by a hooker, a street hooker with her leg out and stopped at a stop sign that she was by.
[1:52:08.800 --> 1:52:14.800]  And then you drove on past and a year later they got a video and they go, sir, you drove by a hooker and you stopped.
[1:52:14.800 --> 1:52:19.800]  Well, there was a stop sign. Well, we're taking your car.
[1:52:19.800 --> 1:52:25.800]  There it is Sessions rejected Russia proposal by campaign advisor, which he's always talked about.
[1:52:25.800 --> 1:52:29.800]  And the worst they've got is at some Trump event. There was a Russian ambassador there.
[1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:33.800]  Oh my God. Meanwhile, the Democrats are totally in bed with it here.
[1:52:33.800 --> 1:52:39.800]  Let's continue with the show outnumbered on Fox. Here it is.
[1:52:39.800 --> 1:52:49.800]  Campaign advisor Carter Page told a House panel last week that he had informed Sessions of a trip to Russia in July of last year,
[1:52:49.800 --> 1:52:52.800]  but Sessions had denied misleading lawmakers that he didn't know if members of the campaign had met with Russians.
[1:52:52.800 --> 1:52:57.800]  Joining us now, Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan, a member of the House, did you share?
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:01.800]  So Papinopoulos did this and Carter Page in a personal trip to Russia.
[1:53:01.800 --> 1:53:04.800]  I mean, and Sessions didn't know at all.
[1:53:04.800 --> 1:53:09.800]  That'd be like saying, you know, did the janitor that works here go visit his mommy last month?
[1:53:09.800 --> 1:53:16.800]  And why don't I know that if he brushed his teeth this morning and ate his Wheaties?
[1:53:16.800 --> 1:53:24.800]  Meanwhile, you've got Mueller killing the investigation of Iranian one backman on tarmacs in Moscow with weapons grade uranium
[1:53:24.800 --> 1:53:32.800]  and hundreds of millions of dollars and just, I'm sorry, Tom in London.
[1:53:32.800 --> 1:53:36.800]  Tom, you're on the air. Thank you for calling today.
[1:53:36.800 --> 1:53:37.800]  Hi, Alex.
[1:53:37.800 --> 1:53:39.800]  Welcome, sir.
[1:53:39.800 --> 1:53:46.800]  Yeah, so I've got a prediction today about Trump.
[1:53:46.800 --> 1:53:50.800]  I just want to establish my track record on predictions on your show.
[1:53:50.800 --> 1:53:52.800]  It's pretty much 100%.
[1:53:52.800 --> 1:53:59.800]  I mean, two and a half years ago, I predicted Trump would win and Brexit would pass.
[1:53:59.800 --> 1:54:01.800]  I put bets on and so on.
[1:54:01.800 --> 1:54:05.800]  I remember you called or somebody with your similar voice.
[1:54:05.800 --> 1:54:12.800]  Yeah, yeah. And you have a freakish memory and you sort of, you always remember, you know, my previous calls.
[1:54:12.800 --> 1:54:13.800]  So, yeah.
[1:54:13.800 --> 1:54:14.800]  Well, you have a distinctive voice.
[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:22.800]  And also last time, last time I spoke here, actually, it was three weeks before the general election in the UK.
[1:54:22.800 --> 1:54:26.800]  Aren't you the guy that also thinks I'm too hard on Islam?
[1:54:26.800 --> 1:54:37.800]  Well, I think, well, well, yeah, well, yes, you are, but I think it's a big distraction in Islam.
[1:54:37.800 --> 1:54:39.800]  Okay, so we talked a year ago.
[1:54:39.800 --> 1:54:48.800]  Well, to me, if they'll bring in radical Muslims and let them kill us, it shows the globalist haters and don't want to bring incompatible people and don't want to reform Islam.
[1:54:48.800 --> 1:54:51.800]  I mean, if Christians were running around doing this, I'd say don't do it.
[1:54:51.800 --> 1:54:54.800]  I mean, it's just out of control, but I wanted to make sure you were the same guy.
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:56.800]  So go ahead and make your new prediction.
[1:54:56.800 --> 1:55:01.800]  Yeah, I'm not talking about it by Muslims today, but well, I can do.
[1:55:01.800 --> 1:55:04.800]  Um, yeah, so I phoned you in May of this year.
[1:55:04.800 --> 1:55:11.800]  It was just before the UK general election and I said it was going to be a hung parliament and nobody was saying that.
[1:55:11.800 --> 1:55:12.800]  You did say that.
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:22.800]  But it was easy for me to, it was easy for me to work out because of Corbyn would have won if it wasn't for those bombings.
[1:55:22.800 --> 1:55:31.800]  So they essentially, they had to stage those, the Manchester bombings and the attacks in London in order to keep Theresa May in power.
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:32.800]  But anyway, I don't know.
[1:55:32.800 --> 1:55:34.800]  I mean, what's the evidence of them staging them?
[1:55:34.800 --> 1:55:37.800]  I mean, clearly they let the jihadis in and then they attack.
[1:55:37.800 --> 1:55:42.800]  So it's staged one way or the other because they knew who they were like this guy, the FBI tried to arrest him in 2015.
[1:55:42.800 --> 1:55:45.800]  They just attacked New York, but these are real jihadis.
[1:55:45.800 --> 1:55:51.800]  I get that governments order stand downs so the terrorists can attack, but I mean.
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:56:01.800]  I would suggest that they, why would Theresa May, why would they bring all the jihadis in and then sit there and let them attack on top of it when that makes them unpopular?
[1:56:01.800 --> 1:56:02.800]  I mean, I just don't know.
[1:56:02.800 --> 1:56:07.800]  I mean, if they're trying to prop up anti Islamic governments, why don't they just get hardcore?
[1:56:07.800 --> 1:56:10.800]  That's popular to begin with.
[1:56:10.800 --> 1:56:13.800]  Well, the attack is all so called homegrown anyway.
[1:56:13.800 --> 1:56:16.800]  So I mean, the bringing them in is a bit of a
[1:56:16.800 --> 1:56:23.800]  I was just putting, I was just pointing that out because that was also a prediction.
[1:56:23.800 --> 1:56:24.800]  Okay, we were talking about some of your predictions.
[1:56:24.800 --> 1:56:25.800]  So what's your next prediction?
[1:56:25.800 --> 1:56:27.800]  Go ahead and get it out.
[1:56:27.800 --> 1:56:35.800]  Okay, so the 31st of orders this year, I put a bet on the Trump would be out of office within a year.
[1:56:35.800 --> 1:56:38.800]  And that's what I think is going to happen.
[1:56:38.800 --> 1:57:02.800]  But before then, he's going to take the United States and probably the UK into an enormous war with Iran and Iran, and it's going to be Saudi Arabia and Israel, which is an incredibly dangerous axis, playing along with the Trump administration on that part of the US government.
[1:57:02.800 --> 1:57:13.800]  And the North Korea thing is just an enormous smokescreen. Nothing is going to happen in North Korea because it's not in the establishment and globalist interest or anything to happen in North Korea.
[1:57:13.800 --> 1:57:15.800]  All right, I find this intriguing. Stay there.
[1:57:15.800 --> 1:57:22.800]  I'm going to go to break Tom and I want you to come back and walk through why Trump would walk into something, how they will remove him in this scenario.
[1:57:22.800 --> 1:57:32.800]  As I agree, Saudi Arabia is lining up for war with Iran. The battle lines are being drawn. Any operatives that have been working with Iran have been arrested or killed.
[1:57:32.800 --> 1:57:38.800]  The world is going into a very, very crazy time. We'll be back with our number three to finish up with Tom, then all the other callers straight ahead as well.

[1:59:48.800 --> 2:00:12.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:12.800 --> 2:00:20.800]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[2:00:20.800 --> 2:00:45.800]  American rebirth and renaissance one year after the historic Trump victory 34 hour special live broadcast beginning tomorrow 8am. Say what you want about Trump, irrevocable damage to the globalist order, major prosperity to the general population, free market being promoted, political correctness having its back broken, nationalist movements launched globally, the EU imploding.
[2:00:45.800 --> 2:00:55.800]  But Phil Mudd and others at the CIA said they'd already have Trump out of office. Now they're telling people in DC high level bush operatives that trouble be gone by December.
[2:00:55.800 --> 2:01:05.800]  Well I think rumors of his demise have been greatly exaggerated but I have remembered Tom in London calling with some accurate predictions in the last two and a half years.
[2:01:05.800 --> 2:01:18.800]  So you've got about four minutes here. Recap what you said. They are gearing up for war. Saudi Arabia with Iran. All this act of war, this missile getting launched out of Yemen into there with that whole civil war.
[2:01:18.800 --> 2:01:30.800]  Give us your calculus and why you think this is the case and are you saying Trump is a player in this because again I'm not betting Trump's going to be gone in a year. Go ahead.
[2:01:30.800 --> 2:01:37.800]  I mean he certainly won't be gone by December because he won't have done what he's supposed to do by then.
[2:01:37.800 --> 2:01:48.800]  The Iran thing, it's going to start with the usual thing. It's going to be a false play. I mean I think that's the only way that they can actually do it.
[2:01:48.800 --> 2:02:03.800]  And in Saudi Arabia they're getting rid of, it's quite interesting that Israeli publications like Deb Kaffir are pointing to what's going on in Saudi Arabia as getting rid of opposition to reforms.
[2:02:03.800 --> 2:02:10.800]  But what they're really doing is getting rid of opposition to Iranian aggression.
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:20.800]  No, I agree. That's why White House sources tell us that these were people that were soft on Iran and that that's why they're being arrested, not corruption.
[2:02:20.800 --> 2:02:23.800]  And they were also anti-Trump forces.
[2:02:23.800 --> 2:02:39.800]  They were blocking aggression against Iran. And now, you know, this has all been done very quickly, which indicates that what's going to actually happen is going to be in the fairly near future, maybe early next year.
[2:02:39.800 --> 2:02:56.800]  And also they're bringing down the North Korea smart screen. I mean the North Korea was an important smart screen, but this is now being sort of gradually being brought down, making way for the Iranian situation.
[2:02:56.800 --> 2:03:08.800]  But why would Trump allow, okay, how are they going to get rid of Trump? Because, I mean, surely Iran and what we see with Saudi Arabia, Sunni versus Shi'i, that's the ongoing big civil war.
[2:03:08.800 --> 2:03:15.800]  It is getting hotter. I mean, you're right there. I mean, I told people 15 years ago, Saudi Arabia has nukes. So does Iran. Now that's coming out.
[2:03:15.800 --> 2:03:22.800]  So a lot of this is known. But why would Trump be removed in the process after this? What's the calculus there?
[2:03:22.800 --> 2:03:34.800]  Well, there's not necessarily a collection, a connection there. But I mean, that's part of the wider idea with the wider reason that the establishment wanted Trump.
[2:03:34.800 --> 2:03:46.800]  Yeah, but Hillary and the top globalists and Soros funding her thought Trump was good because he'd lose in a general election and actually, you know, made him the focus early on because they don't know what they're doing.
[2:03:46.800 --> 2:03:57.800]  They're not unified. They're not one global elite now. It's fractured. And there's major moves inside the establishment for prosperity and to get out of the eugenics based depopulation plan.
[2:03:57.800 --> 2:04:03.800]  I mean, there's a real debate going on, brother, inside the power structure about that right now.
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:10.800]  I think they put up Hillary because they knew that you would lose. And because I mean, some people.
[2:04:10.800 --> 2:04:16.800]  Let me ask you this. Do you think Trump, why do they want to get rid of Trump?
[2:04:16.800 --> 2:04:20.800]  They want to get rid of Trump in disgrace sort of thing.
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:28.800]  But do you think Trump knows that? Sure. To repudiate nationalism, create a global depression or something like they did in 29 to blame nationalism?
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:30.800]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:35.800]  We're not going to put up with that. It's not going to happen. So we're aware of a lot of what's going on.
[2:04:35.800 --> 2:04:39.800]  You are right. They're hearing out for war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
[2:04:39.800 --> 2:04:44.800]  But again, we'll see what ends up unfolding.
[2:04:44.800 --> 2:04:51.800]  I don't think Trump, in many ways, is a joker in a good way, wants to be somebody else's man.
[2:04:51.800 --> 2:04:54.800]  I think the globalists are in deep trouble.
[2:04:54.800 --> 2:05:03.800]  My fellow freedom lovers, Alex Jones here with a very important message. Secret 12, 40% off the best vitamin B12 out there from our research.
[2:05:03.800 --> 2:05:10.800]  Take it under the tongue. Simply amazing. That sale is continuing. Supermelt, vitality for stamina, libido, energy.
[2:05:10.800 --> 2:05:19.800]  That's 30% off. That's continuing. And the other really, really good news is that, yes, we're having to end the sale of 50% off on Anthroplex.
[2:05:19.800 --> 2:05:26.800]  But DNA force, after almost four months, out of stock is back in stock. 25% off our flagship product.
[2:05:26.800 --> 2:05:31.800]  Also, biome defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[2:05:31.800 --> 2:05:35.800]  So a lot of things are selling out, and a lot of things are still at record sales.
[2:05:35.800 --> 2:05:40.800]  White silver bullets, super high quality colloidal silver, is still 50% off.
[2:05:40.800 --> 2:05:44.800]  And there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[2:05:44.800 --> 2:05:49.800]  Whether it's DNA force or whether it's silver bullet, it's all available right now at infowarslife.com
[2:05:49.800 --> 2:06:15.800]  or by calling toll-free.888-253-3139.
[2:06:19.800 --> 2:06:26.800]  And that's the end of this video. Thank you for watching.
[2:06:50.800 --> 2:06:57.800]  We had a caller earlier who's been calling for two and a half, three years, and he's made some predictions that came true.
[2:06:57.800 --> 2:07:01.800]  I mean, I predicted Trump was going to win the nomination or win the presidency too.
[2:07:01.800 --> 2:07:08.800]  So it doesn't mean that everything I predict comes true, but he thinks after a big Iran-Saudi war that's coming
[2:07:08.800 --> 2:07:15.800]  that clearly is now being moved to the front burner, that then Trump will be removed to discredit nationalism.
[2:07:15.800 --> 2:07:19.800]  Well, I don't think Trump wants to go along with that. Clearly, the globalists are thinking about that.
[2:07:19.800 --> 2:07:23.800]  Clearly, they're pushing that. We're going to go to your phone calls right now, and then coming up,
[2:07:23.800 --> 2:07:26.800]  I've got some really amazing clips I want to get to.
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:31.800]  A congressman gets really rattled by a woman exposing some key issues we're going to get to.
[2:07:31.800 --> 2:07:36.800]  We've got more on what happened in Texas. And of course, we're taking your phone calls right now.
[2:07:36.800 --> 2:07:47.800]  We're about to go to Tal, Alyssa, Zach, and Mark. But we are seeing the globalists try to destroy this credit nationalism,
[2:07:47.800 --> 2:07:58.800]  but they're being irrevocably damaged. And the authoritarian nature and unelected nature and anti-free market and anti-prosperity nature, ethos,
[2:07:58.800 --> 2:08:06.800]  worldview of the New World Order is so anti-human and so bad and so villainous,
[2:08:06.800 --> 2:08:14.800]  they may have some delusional plan to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, but it isn't happening.
[2:08:14.800 --> 2:08:22.800]  The move against globalism, the move to decentralize has always been happening, and now it's accelerating.
[2:08:22.800 --> 2:08:28.800]  The best laid plans of mice and men often go astray.
[2:08:28.800 --> 2:08:35.800]  And these globalists have the same disease of authoritarianism where they become megalomaniacs and they believe they're invincible.
[2:08:35.800 --> 2:08:40.800]  I know so many people that make a couple hundred thousand dollars a year that go from being a normal person,
[2:08:40.800 --> 2:08:43.800]  making fifty thousand dollars a year to being crazy and believing they're invincible.
[2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:49.800]  I know folks that become movie stars and go crazy. I mean, most people get power, they go nuts.
[2:08:49.800 --> 2:08:56.800]  They made a bunch of documentaries and books where most people, like ninety-five percent or more,
[2:08:56.800 --> 2:09:00.800]  it's almost a hundred percent that win fifty million, a hundred million, two hundred million dollars in a lottery.
[2:09:00.800 --> 2:09:08.800]  It destroys their life, their children, them within two years. Their debtor and president are bankrupt.
[2:09:08.800 --> 2:09:14.800]  And the globalists are the same way. I mean, they are just out of control.
[2:09:14.800 --> 2:09:20.800]  And once they don't have the public's support, once the public's not in a trance, once the public's awake,
[2:09:20.800 --> 2:09:25.800]  once the public knows that the social contract has been violated,
[2:09:25.800 --> 2:09:31.800]  we will form a new social contract together for prosperity that removes them from the equation entirely.
[2:09:31.800 --> 2:09:37.800]  And if they want a war, they'll get one of those too.
[2:09:37.800 --> 2:09:44.800]  Imagine all the little mindless devil worshippers, scumbags that feel like they're part of the power structure with the professors and everybody.
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:49.800]  And now the Christians and folks they hate that they look down on aren't being their intellectual slaves anymore.
[2:09:49.800 --> 2:09:53.800]  So they think they'll go kill some people at some churches and stuff to whip us back into support.
[2:09:53.800 --> 2:10:04.800]  We see right through you, you little punks.
[2:10:04.800 --> 2:10:14.800]  Insecure pedophiles who don't want a relationship with a full grown woman, they're attracted to little kids.
[2:10:14.800 --> 2:10:17.800]  Turns out Kelly was a pedophile. Of course he was.
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:23.800]  You got a pedophile problem. You got a devil worshipper problem. You got a punk problem.
[2:10:23.800 --> 2:10:27.800]  They think they're smarter than everybody. They're lazy. They're stupid.
[2:10:27.800 --> 2:10:35.800]  They're video game TV heads. It's always the same MO. They're always on drugs and they want to do something nasty and big to be manly.
[2:10:35.800 --> 2:10:41.800]  Waddle in, you know, 100 pounds overweight and there's a little black tactically uniform and shoot some women.
[2:10:41.800 --> 2:10:48.800]  He didn't go join a boxing class or jiu-jitsu class. He didn't go actually become a medic in the military.
[2:10:48.800 --> 2:10:55.800]  He didn't know. He just went around and beat up his girlfriend and his wife and beat up his step kids because he was a punk.
[2:10:55.800 --> 2:11:01.800]  Because he needed to have his teeth knocked out. He needed to have his brain stopped out.
[2:11:01.800 --> 2:11:06.800]  But see today, we let these punks just walk around, don't we?
[2:11:06.800 --> 2:11:14.800]  Next time I see one of these little devil worshippers pushing somebody around, I'm going to go ahead and do what's right.
[2:11:14.800 --> 2:11:20.800]  I'm going to go ahead and ask them if they're looking for a fight. Why don't they go ahead and get one right now?
[2:11:20.800 --> 2:11:26.800]  See, they always want to creep off. It's always about how they're in charge, how they're going to have it on their time.
[2:11:26.800 --> 2:11:29.800]  They're going to become a professor and corrupt your children.
[2:11:29.800 --> 2:11:35.800]  Look at him. He wants little girls because he's intimidated by women.
[2:11:35.800 --> 2:11:42.800]  He doesn't see beautiful, sexy, full grown women and all their strength and everything and want that.
[2:11:42.800 --> 2:11:51.800]  He didn't know how to tell a joke. He didn't know how to have fun. He just knows how to act like a little devil worshipper, pedophile.
[2:11:51.800 --> 2:11:56.800]  He knows how to waddle into a church and kill a bunch of men, women and children. He's a real tough guy.
[2:11:56.800 --> 2:12:00.800]  Well, you know what, you little bastard? You're dead now.
[2:12:00.800 --> 2:12:06.800]  You got your permission from Antifa, the media, to go out. Yeah, your mother-in-law is there.
[2:12:06.800 --> 2:12:09.800]  There are a bunch of Christians. You hate them and you're a big leftist antifun.
[2:12:09.800 --> 2:12:13.800]  You know what, you'll kill two birds with one stone. You've got permission to be a sack of crap.
[2:12:13.800 --> 2:12:19.800]  You're going to go in there and kill a bunch of people, but oh, did you drop your gun and run once you got shot in the leg in the stomach?
[2:12:19.800 --> 2:12:25.800]  Peeping on yourself, they reported going, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy, mommy.
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:29.800]  When you bled out on the side of the highway, you little coward.
[2:12:29.800 --> 2:12:34.800]  Tell them South Carolina, thanks for holding her on the air. Welcome.
[2:12:34.800 --> 2:12:40.800]  Hi Alex, how are you? Dead brother. I just want to make two points.
[2:12:40.800 --> 2:12:46.800]  I know how it is being a radio show host myself in the past, so I know a lot of people are waiting.
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:51.800]  But first of all, I want to talk about the uranium one victim.
[2:12:51.800 --> 2:12:59.800]  These are people that Hillary Clinton has directly affected with her Russian deal, such as the ranchers out in Oregon,
[2:12:59.800 --> 2:13:04.800]  the Hammond and those that went supported, supported the Hammond.
[2:13:04.800 --> 2:13:12.800]  You do know that the Bundy's uncovered evidence about uranium one deal, and that's probably why they're sitting in prison right now.
[2:13:12.800 --> 2:13:21.800]  I didn't know that. I thought they stood up against a bunch of land grabs that Trump's now reversing on land that they had the surface rights to since 1877.
[2:13:21.800 --> 2:13:27.800]  The dumb liberal public's like, how do you have the right to the top if you don't own it? Total morons.
[2:13:27.800 --> 2:13:35.800]  I know they found the Communist Chinese. We're going to use them as an easement for their scam with Harry Reid, who's now gone.
[2:13:35.800 --> 2:13:38.800]  But no, tell me about it.
[2:13:38.800 --> 2:13:44.800]  Harry Reid definitely wants their land. His son, Roy, wants their land for the solar farm next door to it.
[2:13:44.800 --> 2:13:51.800]  That was confirmed, and then the media played games and went, oh, it was going to be an easement, not the solar farm. Alex was wrong.
[2:13:51.800 --> 2:13:56.800]  It's the same thing as the solar farm. I said an easement for the solar farm. Sorry, go ahead.
[2:13:56.800 --> 2:14:06.800]  Yes, well, you do know the Hammons. The uranium one deal is coming off of their land and all the surrounding land.
[2:14:06.800 --> 2:14:12.800]  You know, I knew that some of the uranium was out there in Oregon. I didn't know that. Wow, is that even in the news?
[2:14:12.800 --> 2:14:18.800]  No, it is not. But that is part of what the Bundy's uncovered when they went and occupied the Malia Refuge last year.
[2:14:18.800 --> 2:14:25.800]  And that's probably why they're being demonized now, and Mr. Levois Finnecombe was shot and murdered by the FBI.
[2:14:25.800 --> 2:14:29.800]  They're using the BLM as their Nazi Gestapo, for that matter.
[2:14:29.800 --> 2:14:36.800]  I know. They're even indicting the people that were involved shooting them. That is just crazy. Wow, I'll look into that.
[2:14:36.800 --> 2:14:38.800]  What else do you think about what's going on in the world?
[2:14:38.800 --> 2:14:49.800]  Well, the Texas church shooting the false flag attack. You know, every time that the Communist Democrats have one of their treasonous activities exposed,
[2:14:49.800 --> 2:14:53.800]  there's always a false flag attack happening in the United States to get our attention off of it.
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:14:57.800]  Because every time the uranium-1 deal comes out, every time they get caught with the Don and Brazil stuff,
[2:14:57.800 --> 2:15:02.800]  there's magically one of the little demons that goes and kills some people. And it never matters that he's admittedly Antifa.
[2:15:02.800 --> 2:15:10.800]  They just say, oh, there's no connection. He attacked Christians, he's wearing black, he's set on his own LinkedIn, he loves Antifa,
[2:15:10.800 --> 2:15:17.800]  and hates Christians. There you go. I hate Christians, he says, and goes and kills them, and they ask what the motive is.
[2:15:17.800 --> 2:15:25.800]  That's right. It's also a gun grabbing attempt. Like the congressman from Illinois, his name is Quigley, you just talked about earlier.
[2:15:25.800 --> 2:15:26.800]  Yes.
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:37.800]  Yeah, but it's always a good guy with a gun that can stop a bad guy with a gun. And I guess they're competing for the title of the greatest guns salesman in history,
[2:15:37.800 --> 2:15:38.800]  trying to get that from Obama.
[2:15:38.800 --> 2:15:44.800]  Well, that's the good news, Tal, is you're awake, I'm awake, and we're never going back under their spell again. God bless you.
[2:15:44.800 --> 2:15:50.800]  Keep spreading the word. I love you. That's a great caller. Alyssa, Zach, Mark, and others, your calls are only a few minutes away.

[2:20:47.800 --> 2:21:02.800]  It's called the Russian Revolution. We've got a breakdown of that that Gavin Wentz put together coming up in the next segment, and I've got some other powerful videos.
[2:21:02.800 --> 2:21:08.800]  But right now, let's go to your calls. Let's go to Alyssa in Oregon. Thank you for holding patiently.
[2:21:08.800 --> 2:21:12.800]  Hi, Alex. It's an honor to be on the phone with you again.
[2:21:12.800 --> 2:21:13.800]  Thank you.
[2:21:13.800 --> 2:21:17.800]  I got one quick little suggestion before I get into my question.
[2:21:17.800 --> 2:21:27.800]  My little brother, he has autism, and because of, you know, his problems from the vaccinations, he has a lot of food allergies.
[2:21:27.800 --> 2:21:34.800]  And I think he could really benefit from your bone broth, but unfortunately, it has milk products in it.
[2:21:34.800 --> 2:21:45.800]  I was wondering if there's any possible way you might consider making a sort of offshoot of bone broth, but without any dairy products.
[2:21:45.800 --> 2:21:52.800]  Now, that's a great point. We should come out with a variant that doesn't have basically whey products in it for people that have a lactose intolerance.
[2:21:52.800 --> 2:22:00.800]  That's a great idea. We're expanding the entire InfoWarsLife brand so that we can obviously find our operation and help people have better lives.
[2:22:00.800 --> 2:22:05.800]  So a 360 win. But that is a great point. We will try to work on that.
[2:22:05.800 --> 2:22:18.800]  Okay. Now for my question. Ever since you had that pastor on, you know, I remembered about a man I heard about during the election, a retired firefighter named Mark Taylor.
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:21.800]  I don't know if you've ever heard of him.
[2:22:21.800 --> 2:22:26.800]  I'll look it up. I may have forgotten. I may have forgotten. Mark Pear?
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:28.800]  Mark Taylor.
[2:22:28.800 --> 2:22:35.800]  He says that God showed him in 2011 that Donald Trump would become president of the United States.
[2:22:35.800 --> 2:22:39.800]  Now, of course, I was naturally skeptical about this. You know, there's a lot of...
[2:22:39.800 --> 2:22:41.800]  Did you find the original timestamp video?
[2:22:41.800 --> 2:22:51.800]  I actually saw the video in April 18, 2016.
[2:22:51.800 --> 2:22:58.800]  That was his first interview, basically detailing pretty much how the entire election was going to go down.
[2:22:58.800 --> 2:23:01.800]  And it pretty much happened exactly how he said.
[2:23:01.800 --> 2:23:08.800]  He also talked about how Trump was going to pick five Supreme Court justices.
[2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:11.800]  Looks like that number is going to happen too.
[2:23:11.800 --> 2:23:17.800]  And also talking about how the death of Antonin Scalia was also a sign.
[2:23:17.800 --> 2:23:23.800]  All right. Well, thank you, Alyssa. I'll have to look into that. Thank you. We'll look into that. Thank you very much.
[2:23:23.800 --> 2:23:28.800]  By the way, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to play the clip of Trump hours after the text of shooting,
[2:23:28.800 --> 2:23:34.800]  seeing we have a lot of mental problems in America, and they're getting worse because of the culture and the drugs and the TV.
[2:23:34.800 --> 2:23:38.800]  I mean, just all of us contributing to the breakdown of society.
[2:23:38.800 --> 2:23:43.800]  Church government escaped from mental hospital in 2012.
[2:23:43.800 --> 2:23:48.800]  I mean, this guy was a mesh, but of course he was a liberal.
[2:23:48.800 --> 2:23:53.800]  Here is the president predicting it and being proven correct. Here it is.
[2:23:53.800 --> 2:23:59.800]  Your problem here. This was a very based on preliminary reports, very deranged individual.
[2:23:59.800 --> 2:24:02.800]  A lot of problems over a long period of time.
[2:24:02.800 --> 2:24:07.800]  We have a lot of mental health problems in our country as do other countries.
[2:24:07.800 --> 2:24:15.800]  But this isn't a guns situation. I mean, we could go into it, but it's a little bit soon to go into it.
[2:24:15.800 --> 2:24:19.800]  But fortunately, somebody else had a gun that we're shooting in the opposite direction.
[2:24:19.800 --> 2:24:23.800]  Otherwise, it would have been as bad as it was. It would have been much worse.
[2:24:23.800 --> 2:24:28.800]  But this is a mental health problem at the highest level.
[2:24:28.800 --> 2:24:34.800]  It's a very, very sad event. These are great people and a very, very sad event.
[2:24:34.800 --> 2:24:40.800]  But the media said Trump was wrong and horrible, but oh, here it is.
[2:24:40.800 --> 2:24:46.800]  Now being reported by ABC News, CBS News, KHOU, out of Houston,
[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:50.800]  church government escaped from mental hospital in 2012.
[2:24:50.800 --> 2:24:58.800]  The government who killed 20 ex people in south Texas church Sunday escaped from a mental health facility in New Mexico in 2012.
[2:24:58.800 --> 2:25:05.800]  According to documents obtained by KHOU11 News, Devin Kelly was sent to the park,
[2:25:05.800 --> 2:25:14.800]  behavioral health services center in San Teresa, New Mexico after beating his wife and child while stationed at Holloman Air Force Base.
[2:25:14.800 --> 2:25:18.800]  Should have just gone to prison and got his ass kicked.
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:25.800]  These punks never do. On June 13, 2012, Kelly escaped from the center and fled across the state line to El Paso.
[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:29.800]  In the missing person report, Kelly was described as a danger to himself and others,
[2:25:29.800 --> 2:25:35.800]  and had already been caught sneaking firearms onto Holloman Air Force Base.
[2:25:35.800 --> 2:25:42.800]  But the Air Force didn't transfer the disarmament discharge to the FBI database.
[2:25:42.800 --> 2:25:47.800]  The report said Kelly was attempting to carry out death threats.
[2:25:47.800 --> 2:25:52.800]  Man, lock his butt up, man.
[2:25:52.800 --> 2:25:55.800]  He made on the military chain of command.
[2:25:55.800 --> 2:26:00.800]  He's threatening to kill the chain of command all of it. He escapes from mental institution.
[2:26:00.800 --> 2:26:04.800]  I think that gives you about 10 years and a super max right there.
[2:26:04.800 --> 2:26:11.800]  I mean, it's always mental patients. We know they're coming. No one's going after them. They let them get the weapons.
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:15.800]  And then they blame us. No, I will not be blamed for this comeback.
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:25.800]  I will not collectively take the guilt of hundreds of millions killed by communists and authoritarians in countries where they had no guns.
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:36.800]  But here is Cuomo refuting the mental illness statement of the president proving what a complete congenital liar or moron or both he is. Here it is.
[2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:46.800]  Reality for all the talk about mental illness as the key study showed the US doesn't have more mental illness than anywhere else.
[2:26:46.800 --> 2:26:55.800]  But we do have 25 times the rate of gun murder. 25 times Americans own more guns per capita than any other country.
[2:26:55.800 --> 2:27:02.800]  In fact, half of all civilian owned guns in the world are owned by Americans.
[2:27:02.800 --> 2:27:08.800]  America has more mass shootings than any other country in the world.
[2:27:08.800 --> 2:27:13.800]  We own more guns. We have more mass shootings. What are we going to do about it?
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:19.800]  Oh, we'll get rid of your bodyguards. No. But England has what 15 times the knife attacks we do because they don't have guns.
[2:27:19.800 --> 2:27:25.800]  Yes, it's true that per capita for any free country, we have the highest rate of gun crime.
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:36.800]  But if you then look at all the other crime statistics, many of them are lower. So again, it's all distorted overall crime using guns is down 61% FBI statistics since 1992.
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:42.800]  What they do is hype up the mass shootings to create the perception, but the statistics are up this year from last year.
[2:27:42.800 --> 2:27:48.800]  If you count Mandalay Bay and now this event. And of course, a lot of this is leftist pulling off false flags.
[2:27:48.800 --> 2:27:57.800]  I believe demonize the second amendment. They certainly fit the entire MO. But there is the president.
[2:27:57.800 --> 2:28:06.800]  There is President Trump completely vindicated. It now turns out breaking if you just tuned in that.
[2:28:06.800 --> 2:28:10.800]  The shooter from Texas in the mass murder at the church.
[2:28:10.800 --> 2:28:20.800]  Devin Kelly escaped from a mental hospital in 2012 after the military put him there for trying to bring guns on base to kill his chain of command.
[2:28:20.800 --> 2:28:27.800]  For punishing him for attacking his wife and stepchild and that he was trying to bring weapons on to kill them.
[2:28:27.800 --> 2:28:34.800]  What did the Air Force do? Well, I guess they covered it up because they never transferred the information to the FBI.
[2:28:34.800 --> 2:28:40.800]  Nick system so that he couldn't get guns via his dishonorable discharge and he was able to get him.
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:53.800]  So we need to find out who in his chain of command dropped the ball and they need to be standing tall before the man and have their butts court-martialed and thrown in prison because they are partially responsible.
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:29:03.800]  Katie armor has been on a mission to manufacture the most comfortable body armor on the market and we've succeeded with the release of our CQB technology.
[2:29:03.800 --> 2:29:07.800]  We now offer the most comfortable concealable rifle threat body armor available.

[2:29:56.800 --> 2:30:10.800]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from M4 store

[2:30:27.800 --> 2:30:30.800]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.

[2:34:25.800 --> 2:34:26.800]  We're not going to give up.

[2:34:45.800 --> 2:34:50.800]  In the next segment, there's a new vicious Netflix program meant to kick off civil war right on time.
[2:34:50.800 --> 2:34:57.800]  We're going to tell you about and a very powerful speech that triggers a globalist in Congress.
[2:34:57.800 --> 2:35:00.800]  Congress when flip sound and a pro-life act was advocacy schools and abortion.
[2:35:00.800 --> 2:35:02.800]  That's coming up as well.
[2:35:02.800 --> 2:35:05.800]  But first, let's go back to the calls.
[2:35:05.800 --> 2:35:09.800]  Let's talk to Mark in Florida, then we'll go to Zach, Anthony, and others.
[2:35:09.800 --> 2:35:11.800]  Mark, welcome.
[2:35:11.800 --> 2:35:12.800]  Hello, Alex.
[2:35:12.800 --> 2:35:14.800]  Yes, I'm in Oregon today.
[2:35:14.800 --> 2:35:17.800]  I'm not in Florida today, but it's great to speak with you.
[2:35:17.800 --> 2:35:24.800]  Alex, by the way, if you could possibly get, like tomorrow's broadcast would be a big example,
[2:35:24.800 --> 2:35:29.800]  make that accessible to people who only have the option to listen to you,
[2:35:29.800 --> 2:35:33.800]  listen to you on the telephone on the listen line.
[2:35:33.800 --> 2:35:35.800]  We miss everything.
[2:35:35.800 --> 2:35:38.800]  Basically, we only get your show, which is a whole lot.
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:40.800]  It's everything in itself.
[2:35:40.800 --> 2:35:46.800]  But it'd be wonderful to hear the new programs and everything that comes over the Internet is such.
[2:35:46.800 --> 2:35:47.800]  I sure appreciate it.
[2:35:47.800 --> 2:35:49.800]  We're working hard on the infrastructure.
[2:35:49.800 --> 2:35:52.800]  I've got a team of about 40 people here right now building the new studio.
[2:35:52.800 --> 2:35:56.800]  We're expending all of our fuel to try to expand the operation.
[2:35:56.800 --> 2:36:01.800]  Absolutely, if volunteers want to pick up our streams and do free telephone services for people,
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:03.800]  we'll plug it and put it out.
[2:36:03.800 --> 2:36:04.800]  Right now, we're maxed out.
[2:36:04.800 --> 2:36:11.800]  We need the audience to build the infrastructure or to put us on local stations in their area and then spread the word.
[2:36:11.800 --> 2:36:15.800]  Now, faithfully spend quite a bit of money on your products.
[2:36:15.800 --> 2:36:16.800]  I understand, sir.
[2:36:16.800 --> 2:36:20.800]  I'm just telling you, we are just maxed out.
[2:36:20.800 --> 2:36:21.800]  There's new equipment everywhere.
[2:36:21.800 --> 2:36:23.800]  We're trying to hire people.
[2:36:23.800 --> 2:36:25.800]  We're trying to deal with personnel issues.
[2:36:25.800 --> 2:36:27.800]  I'm just telling you, we are maxed out here.
[2:36:27.800 --> 2:36:29.800]  Like, our guns are melting hot in the Info War.
[2:36:29.800 --> 2:36:31.800]  They're like, we're trying to put new barrels on.
[2:36:31.800 --> 2:36:34.800]  I mean, we're, it's smoking around here.
[2:36:34.800 --> 2:36:40.800]  Can tell just by listening to you, Alex, every day since right after 9-11, you know, I followed you closely.
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:41.800]  I know, brother.
[2:36:41.800 --> 2:36:42.800]  You've been calling for years.
[2:36:42.800 --> 2:36:44.800]  So what's on your mind, my friend?
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:46.800]  It's got to say you're a human dynamo.
[2:36:46.800 --> 2:36:47.800]  No, no, no.
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:48.800]  Wish I was.
[2:36:48.800 --> 2:36:54.800]  Alex, it's quite clear by the laws of this country and even by statements on the other side,
[2:36:54.800 --> 2:37:05.800]  such as Diane Feinstein made recently that Antifa, whatever, how you pronounce it, is a terrorist organization.
[2:37:05.800 --> 2:37:10.800]  They need to be gathered up just as Donald Trump has gathered up the pedophiles.
[2:37:10.800 --> 2:37:14.800]  And if we don't, they're just going to keep on growing because it's not the only,
[2:37:14.800 --> 2:37:16.800]  they have many sister organizations I understand.
[2:37:16.800 --> 2:37:20.800]  Well, they're being listed as terrorists more and more and by the state of New Jersey and other folks.
[2:37:20.800 --> 2:37:22.800]  But you're absolutely right.
[2:37:22.800 --> 2:37:23.800]  And here's the bad news.
[2:37:23.800 --> 2:37:25.800]  They know how to pull false flags now.
[2:37:25.800 --> 2:37:26.800]  They want our guns.
[2:37:26.800 --> 2:37:27.800]  They're communists.
[2:37:27.800 --> 2:37:28.800]  They're always going to have weapons.
[2:37:28.800 --> 2:37:29.800]  They want a violent revolution.
[2:37:29.800 --> 2:37:33.800]  They want to get our guns so they can finally take over.
[2:37:33.800 --> 2:37:35.800]  And here it is, USC shooting.
[2:37:35.800 --> 2:37:36.800]  This is breaking now.
[2:37:36.800 --> 2:37:41.800]  Diamond Opens fire in the University of South Carolina, injuring at least one.
[2:37:41.800 --> 2:37:43.800]  We hope that nobody's been killed.
[2:37:43.800 --> 2:37:47.800]  There is said to be an active shooter situation, University of South Carolina.
[2:37:47.800 --> 2:37:49.800]  But one person to believe had been shot.
[2:37:49.800 --> 2:37:56.800]  University of South Carolina upstate in Spartanburg issued a Twitter alert warning shots fired with four buildings on campus.
[2:37:56.800 --> 2:37:57.800]  Place of lockdown.
[2:37:57.800 --> 2:37:58.800]  That lockdown was later lifted.
[2:37:58.800 --> 2:38:01.800]  So it might have been a backfire or one person shot.
[2:38:01.800 --> 2:38:02.800]  No arrests have been reported.
[2:38:02.800 --> 2:38:03.800]  We'll see.
[2:38:03.800 --> 2:38:04.800]  I hope it's not real.
[2:38:04.800 --> 2:38:05.800]  Mark, anything else?
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:14.800]  Yes, the military and the intelligence community, white hats in this country have a full capability at Donald Trump's behest of actually beginning the
[2:38:14.800 --> 2:38:19.800]  gathering and we already have the camps built and they can be put right into the camps.
[2:38:19.800 --> 2:38:30.800]  There's an example that needs to be made of they're just going to keep on growing and we're going to get to a flare point that's going to cause such chaos that we're never going to get back.
[2:38:30.800 --> 2:38:31.800]  Sure, sure.
[2:38:31.800 --> 2:38:39.800]  I don't want to become what we're fighting, but the groups calling for violent overthrow, calling for killing people, they should be arrested and tried by juries of their peers.
[2:38:39.800 --> 2:38:44.800]  And people should be pulling their money out of the globalist institutions.
[2:38:44.800 --> 2:38:47.800]  They should be getting really aggressive, but they have built FEMA camps.
[2:38:47.800 --> 2:38:50.800]  They have built emergency centers for conservatives, libertarians.
[2:38:50.800 --> 2:39:00.800]  If a civil war does break out and things get rough, I mean, we'll probably have to use them, but it's not going to be secret and we're going to have lawyers and these people are going to end up, you know, getting their trials.
[2:39:00.800 --> 2:39:05.800]  But we may have to set up emergency centers if they start up because they're trying to get the average leftist to go out and start killing.
[2:39:05.800 --> 2:39:14.800]  And if they all just start killing in mass, we will have to round them up because they are planning a helter-skelter violent leftist spasm.
[2:39:14.800 --> 2:39:16.800]  And we just can't sit here and take it.
[2:39:16.800 --> 2:39:23.800]  I mean, they're a bunch of weird wimps, I appreciate your call, who never had a coming of age, never grew up as men.
[2:39:23.800 --> 2:39:28.800]  Now they're 30, 40 years old and they want to have a coming of age killing Christians and conservatives.
[2:39:28.800 --> 2:39:31.800]  And they're all a bunch of devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[2:39:31.800 --> 2:39:39.800]  They're devil-worshipping pedophiles and it turns out this lunatic in Texas was a homicidal maniac who was a pedophile and was thrown in mental institutions.
[2:39:39.800 --> 2:39:46.800]  He tried to kill a chain of command and I guess they were too scared of him so they just let him out of the military and didn't even transfer the paperwork.
[2:39:46.800 --> 2:39:48.800]  So, you know, this guy's a homicidal maniac.
[2:39:48.800 --> 2:39:54.800]  He should have been locked up for 10 years and, you know, if somebody's so dangerous too, you can't ever release him again.
[2:39:54.800 --> 2:39:55.800]  Give him a lobotomy.
[2:39:55.800 --> 2:40:01.800]  I'm not for lobotomies against, you know, people that aren't violent, but you're a homicidal maniac who wants to kill everybody.
[2:40:01.800 --> 2:40:02.800]  Well, we'll just cut your brain out.
[2:40:02.800 --> 2:40:04.800]  How's that sound?
[2:40:04.800 --> 2:40:06.800]  Zach in Florida, you're on the air.
[2:40:06.800 --> 2:40:08.800]  Go ahead.
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:09.800]  Yes, Alex.
[2:40:09.800 --> 2:40:15.800]  It's great to be back on and I just have to really update some information to connect some thoughts regarding...
[2:40:15.800 --> 2:40:19.800]  Yeah, because you were going to come on as a guest and you got in some trouble.
[2:40:19.800 --> 2:40:20.800]  Yeah.
[2:40:20.800 --> 2:40:27.800]  I didn't even notice that was the regular Zach from Florida. I'm sorry I made you hold an hour, but I'm just all over the map today.
[2:40:27.800 --> 2:40:34.800]  Because you talked about the Saudi Arabia Shakeup that was about to happen, how they were involved with the Vegas attack just to recap for folks.
[2:40:34.800 --> 2:40:36.800]  You've been a great source of info.
[2:40:36.800 --> 2:40:38.800]  So, go ahead.
[2:40:38.800 --> 2:40:40.800]  Yeah, and I got back to Port Nico.
[2:40:40.800 --> 2:40:44.800]  I just haven't heard anything back, but I'm sure you guys are busy there building your operation.
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:53.800]  So, let's get into the Saudi Arabia thing, which is very important. The Shakeup that comes right after the Vegas intel that dropped, which is important.
[2:40:53.800 --> 2:40:55.800]  And this is deep and this is major.
[2:40:55.800 --> 2:40:57.800]  So, let's get right into Yemen.
[2:40:57.800 --> 2:41:00.800]  This is the next play. It's going to be Yemen.
[2:41:00.800 --> 2:41:06.800]  What we have in February, people have such a short memory, but I've compiled the timeline here, so I don't miss this stuff.
[2:41:06.800 --> 2:41:15.800]  In February, we have to remember the Navy SEAL raid in Yemen that Trump ordered that killed a couple of Navy SEALs, came back and Trump quotes,
[2:41:15.800 --> 2:41:18.800]  we have gathered very vital intel.
[2:41:18.800 --> 2:41:29.800]  Immediately following that, you have John McCain completely discrediting Trump coming out and saying that this raid in Yemen was not appropriate.
[2:41:29.800 --> 2:41:31.800]  He doesn't know what he's doing. He's out of control.
[2:41:31.800 --> 2:41:36.800]  And what do you think that was? The information that was gathered in Yemen uncovered them all physically.
[2:41:36.800 --> 2:41:38.800]  They physically gathered that intel.
[2:41:38.800 --> 2:41:43.800]  That was controlling the ISIS Al Qaeda operatives out of Saudi Arabia.
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:52.800]  And it's no coincidence that a few months after that, you have John McCain miraculously having a brain cancer surgery out of nowhere because make no mistake,
[2:41:52.800 --> 2:41:56.800]  he will be questioned in the future and they're just, they're going through some other motions right now,
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:02.800]  but this is very convenient when it's going to come to him being questioned and his lack of memory there for, you know.
[2:42:02.800 --> 2:42:08.800]  Sure, because he went and funded the radical jihadis himself. He quarterbacked the whole deal. He's been up to it, you know, in his eyeballs.
[2:42:08.800 --> 2:42:12.800]  And now you're right. They go get the intel out of Yemen. Now this is happening in Saudi Arabia.
[2:42:12.800 --> 2:42:16.800]  They're rolling up the whole globalist network with the Bushes. You name it.
[2:42:16.800 --> 2:42:23.800]  100%. And the color you had earlier was exhausting. His name was Tom saying that North Korea is not a big issue.
[2:42:23.800 --> 2:42:29.800]  I tell you what, come back in the next segment, Zach. And next time Zach calls in, let me know. It's not your fault.
[2:42:29.800 --> 2:42:34.800]  I could have seen his name. I just don't really, I just go to the next caller in order and then look at the next name later.
[2:42:34.800 --> 2:42:39.800]  I don't really screen the calls. It's kind of go to whoever. But Zach's been a great source of info.
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:44.800]  So we're going to get Zach on tomorrow if he can do it. I'm going to talk to Zach during the break.
[2:42:44.800 --> 2:42:49.800]  So guys asking when he wants to come on any of those times tomorrow, Zach's going to come on and talk all about this.
[2:42:49.800 --> 2:42:54.800]  What a great source of info. We'll be right back.
[2:43:19.800 --> 2:43:23.800]  But with the rapid speed of life, we need to be able to keep up the pace.

[2:44:38.800 --> 2:44:41.800]  When you buy products from Globalist, it's an act of trading with the enemy.
[2:44:41.800 --> 2:44:47.800]  It is an act of war. It is an act of standing up when you spread the links, the articles and buy products from us.
[2:44:47.800 --> 2:44:50.800]  And then we commit to rampage against the enemy totally.
[2:44:53.800 --> 2:44:58.800]  Dr. Group, you developed living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good?
[2:44:58.800 --> 2:45:03.800]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[2:45:03.800 --> 2:45:08.800]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system.
[2:45:08.800 --> 2:45:16.800]  But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:23.800]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[2:45:23.800 --> 2:45:24.800]  These are all parasites.
[2:45:24.800 --> 2:45:27.800]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[2:45:27.800 --> 2:45:31.800]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[2:45:31.800 --> 2:45:34.800]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[2:45:34.800 --> 2:45:38.800]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[2:45:38.800 --> 2:45:41.800]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, infowarslife.com.

[2:46:52.800 --> 2:47:02.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:22.800 --> 2:47:37.800]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. We kick off a 34-hour broadcast celebrating the one year anniversary of the historic victory that is now leading the way for other nations to pull out of unelected authoritarian, communist, and socialist globalism.
[2:47:37.800 --> 2:47:52.800]  Now, he's been calling a couple of years, but he's been calling almost every week the last six months or so, and Zach just has great sources. I don't know his whole background there from former Special Forces Command in Florida.
[2:47:52.800 --> 2:48:04.800]  I think that's where he mentioned some of his info was from before. I just know from all my big sources, and I've got a lot of sources right up to the president. I was leaving at that, who we still occasionally get info directly from.
[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:17.800]  I mean, that's not a secret. In fact, General Kelly's blockade of info is suddenly lifted. It's crazy. He's gotten on board it now, is the information we've gotten.
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:23.800]  He was going to join us last week for an hour, and then I guess he got called in and got in some trouble, even though he's never given us anything classified.
[2:48:23.800 --> 2:48:34.800]  He just pointed out what's happening, and he said last week, Big Shakeup in Saudi Arabia, criminal networks there working with ISIS and Al Qaeda connected in to what happened in Vegas.
[2:48:34.800 --> 2:48:43.800]  And I was given that information from sources in Vegas, but also in the federal government, but they said, please don't talk about that yet.
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:53.800]  But then he called in and talked about it. So he's got some sources. I don't know what he wants to say about himself. He's going to join us by Skype tomorrow. I sure hope it ends up happening.
[2:48:53.800 --> 2:49:03.800]  But just recap Vegas, what you predicted last week, the civil war inside Wahhabist Islam, and what the next big shoot a drop is. I mean, they're killing a bunch of these princes.
[2:49:03.800 --> 2:49:10.800]  There's a civil war over there. They're blowing up their helicopters. And we knew this tied back to trying to find out who's actually behind ISIS.
[2:49:10.800 --> 2:49:16.800]  We now know it's the Clintons, it's Obama, it's Hillary, it's the Arab Spring, it's the Muslim Brotherhood.
[2:49:16.800 --> 2:49:24.800]  And now this is the proof from Yemen in that raid that got the globalists so upset when it happened. So walk us through it.
[2:49:24.800 --> 2:49:30.800]  Okay, so we have the call on October 31st, me and yourself, and they're talking about the Saudi connections in Vegas.
[2:49:30.800 --> 2:49:40.800]  Obviously, during that weekend, you have the incredible shake up in Saudi Arabia, and it's not coincidental, because that was pretty important stuff. And that's kind of stuff you don't bring up.
[2:49:40.800 --> 2:49:48.800]  But because here's the thing with those PMCs, when you have this Prince who was arrested, he's at the big center of this because Prince Al-Waleed, the billionaire who was...
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:53.800]  He's the one always running down Trump quarterbacking a bunch of the leftist stuff here.
[2:49:53.800 --> 2:50:02.800]  He's publicly funded several PMCs, and this is what they do with the private military companies. They run as a certain name in a certain organization, then like Blackwater and some of the other ones, they continue to change names.
[2:50:02.800 --> 2:50:11.800]  And they've been ballsy enough to be in big firefights in Saudi Arabia the last four days. That's not really in our news, but some of it's leaked. I mean, there's actual civil war going on.
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:19.800]  So this happens, we leak the information on the 31st, and obviously we see what happens there on the weekend leading into the new week.
[2:50:19.800 --> 2:50:28.800]  So this happens, but what we have to realize is, and this is the prediction, and this is the next big news, which will occur this week, unless we stop it here.
[2:50:28.800 --> 2:50:36.800]  There's going to be a attack by what will be described as Yemeni nationals in the United States, make no mistake, but these are...
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:46.800]  And I'm just going to go ahead and put the ADC out here. These are CIA operatives, these are CIA proxies who are rogue at this point because their entire infrastructure has been dissolved by the Trump administration.
[2:50:46.800 --> 2:50:55.800]  Okay, when you launch an ICBM from Yemen, there is absolutely not a reality in the world where they have the capability of doing that.
[2:50:55.800 --> 2:51:01.800]  Okay, so for this thing firing into Riyadh being shut down, they are incredibly desperate, and I'm just going to say it right now.
[2:51:01.800 --> 2:51:13.800]  During this week, there is an attempt by Yemeni nationals in the United States to pop false flag. And because they're desperate, but here's the thing, the money source is captured at an evacuated Rick Carlton in Saudi Arabia.
[2:51:13.800 --> 2:51:18.800]  Those individuals, they flushed the Rick Carlton in Saudi Arabia, and they're being held there.
[2:51:18.800 --> 2:51:27.800]  So just as you said weeks before this came out, they pushed their bluff with Trump of a destabilization campaign, and he just basically called their bluff and rolled him up.
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:33.800]  You have, and John McCain is just so done. John McCain plays a big part in this, okay? He plays a major part in this.
[2:51:33.800 --> 2:51:40.800]  He's timestamped on February 2nd, making his comments about the Navy Seas, you know, making the raid in Yemen, and how difficult he was by the...
[2:51:40.800 --> 2:51:46.800]  Well, he's photographed with the leaders of ISIS before they created the group. I mean, he's red-handed.
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:56.800]  Who are in Yemen, as we speak, and are freaking out because the spouts of money has dried up. They got Al-Waleed in Riyadh right now, flushed out.
[2:51:56.800 --> 2:52:07.800]  And let's boil it down, because this is all confirmed. Just like Trump said, Hillary and Obama founded ISIS, Trump is rolling up the double networks that even Saudi Arabia didn't like, because they were used to menacing control Saudi Arabia.
[2:52:07.800 --> 2:52:17.800]  He's going to clean, open, real pragmatic politics. He's told the King this. The King, once he was shown the evidence of the data files, got on board.
[2:52:17.800 --> 2:52:32.800]  Now, they're getting in line, and Iran better get in line, because this is all unfolding, but you're right. They've got stay-behind terror networks in the deep state that's refused to go and is going to now launch attacks and try to blame the Second Amendment.
[2:52:32.800 --> 2:52:35.800]  You can just see it unfolding. So continue.
[2:52:35.800 --> 2:52:47.800]  So, basically, you know, colorless individuals are expecting there will be a war with Iran. No, this is the war with Iran. There is no kinetic war with Iran without their deep state backing.
[2:52:47.800 --> 2:53:01.800]  And that is, thanks to Donald Trump, he has shifted his real military, his real military focus, I guess you could call it, into the South Pacific, in Korea, as we spoke about me and yourself six months ago, bringing up strategic patience.
[2:53:01.800 --> 2:53:08.800]  And Trump's speech in Korea, where he takes his business code off and puts on the bomber jacket, is the most symbolic ever.
[2:53:08.800 --> 2:53:12.800]  He's going to read specifically from a sheet of paper. He's a great speaker in order.
[2:53:12.800 --> 2:53:21.800]  But he speaks and specifically mentions the term strategic patience, which has not been uttered diplomatically, like he has said in the last 25 years.
[2:53:21.800 --> 2:53:26.800]  And that's for good reason, because these are deep state intelligence-backed proxies.
[2:53:26.800 --> 2:53:31.800]  There is no kinetic war with Iran. We're in it right now. We've leaked them. We've double-crossed them.
[2:53:31.800 --> 2:53:35.800]  Trump is playing, I don't even know if you can call it 5G chess. He's so far ahead, it's so brilliant.
[2:53:35.800 --> 2:53:39.800]  And this line that he's an idiot, they are highly mistaken.
[2:53:39.800 --> 2:53:42.800]  Well, I know what Trump did. He went the day after he got elected.
[2:53:42.800 --> 2:53:47.800]  Once he was sworn in, he went to the CIA, he gave them all big plaques, American flag plaques on wood.
[2:53:47.800 --> 2:53:51.800]  I'm only saying that people know that I actually talked to folks that obviously in on the meeting.
[2:53:51.800 --> 2:53:59.800]  And it wasn't a classified meeting. And the point is, but it never leaked. And he said, whoever's for America and wants to be straight shooters, I'm going to back you 100%.
[2:53:59.800 --> 2:54:02.800]  Whoever is it, get ready. I'm coming after you.
[2:54:02.800 --> 2:54:05.800]  And he said, we're not playing games and double-crossing people anymore.
[2:54:05.800 --> 2:54:10.800]  He said, this whole global system of double-crossing and funding terror is over.
[2:54:10.800 --> 2:54:18.800]  Then he got with the people that understood the full operation and green-lighted them, rolling up these networks of the Muslim Brotherhood that we know is,
[2:54:18.800 --> 2:54:22.800]  have been funded by multi-actors in the Middle East, not just Iran.
[2:54:22.800 --> 2:54:26.800]  And so what we're seeing is a major stabilization operation by the president.
[2:54:26.800 --> 2:54:29.800]  But I agree with you, they're going to try to launch some attacks.
[2:54:29.800 --> 2:54:36.800]  But what did they think was going to happen when they pulled off the Vegas operation?
[2:54:36.800 --> 2:54:43.800]  I mean, did they think Trump was just going to crap his pants and say, okay, we'll, you know, please don't stage a bunch of terror attacks?
[2:54:43.800 --> 2:54:46.800]  You know, I'll back off now.
[2:54:46.800 --> 2:54:51.800]  I don't know what they really thought about Trump, and I don't think people have underestimated him, obviously.
[2:54:51.800 --> 2:54:57.800]  But that was symbolic, and that was blackmailing to other people within the actual infrastructure of our government.
[2:54:57.800 --> 2:55:05.800]  There are certain words, keywords, and certain signifiers within an attack, even within the attack in Texas, which you get into,
[2:55:05.800 --> 2:55:12.800]  that are essentially symbols to people within an infrastructure, essentially a hand being played in a game of poker.
[2:55:12.800 --> 2:55:18.800]  And they're also having the drills right now of the U.S. power being knocked out, which is really the cover, and the enemy knows this,
[2:55:18.800 --> 2:55:21.800]  to put teams in place guarding strategic power stations.
[2:55:21.800 --> 2:55:26.800]  This country is on a full war footing right now with the globalists and their Islamic proxy armies.
[2:55:26.800 --> 2:55:28.800]  But we know they've also got other proxy groups.
[2:55:28.800 --> 2:55:31.800]  Any information on who else we should be watching out for?
[2:55:31.800 --> 2:55:33.800]  Well, I'm going to tell you right now, there's no difference.
[2:55:33.800 --> 2:55:41.800]  And if you look at the creation of the state, if you would look into the creation and the actual, you know, standing up of what we call Al Qaeda or today ISIS,
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:43.800]  there's no difference in Antifa.
[2:55:43.800 --> 2:55:52.800]  So you have at the helm, at the actual helm, the funding helm of these groups, you have the state individuals who are carrying this out.
[2:55:52.800 --> 2:56:00.800]  And I'm just going to tell you right now, this Texas shooting, I'm not going to speculate too much, but I shouldn't get into that.
[2:56:00.800 --> 2:56:01.800]  Actually, let me just stop right there.
[2:56:01.800 --> 2:56:07.800]  But you're going to see more attacks like the Texas shooting that will have, that may be double barbed.
[2:56:07.800 --> 2:56:14.800]  And what double barbed means is they have a specific point and they have specific blackmail characteristic to people within the government.
[2:56:14.800 --> 2:56:20.800]  But they also, the double barbed, the second barbed of it is to, you know, carry out political agendas like gun control and...
[2:56:20.800 --> 2:56:22.800]  Sure, and it shows their sick mind.
[2:56:22.800 --> 2:56:27.800]  They think they attack a country music deal, they attack a church, they attack Texas, just like Hitler bombed London.
[2:56:27.800 --> 2:56:30.800]  That only made the brits get behind the war.
[2:56:30.800 --> 2:56:35.800]  I don't know why they think all this intimidation is going to make us give our guns up or make us bow.
[2:56:35.800 --> 2:56:37.800]  They're really stupid.
[2:56:37.800 --> 2:56:43.800]  This week you will see an attempt, and hopefully it's spoiled, I hope, but they're brazen and they're obviously been doing things.
[2:56:43.800 --> 2:56:52.800]  There will be an attempt to attack in the United States of America, a massive attack by an individual group of individuals that have Yemen nationality.
[2:56:52.800 --> 2:56:56.800]  And that's why they keep saying Trump will be gone by December.
[2:56:56.800 --> 2:57:00.800]  They're planning to get things so bad, we go, it's Trump's fault, get rid of him.
[2:57:00.800 --> 2:57:03.800]  I don't understand how they think this is going to work.
[2:57:03.800 --> 2:57:06.800]  Yeah, I mean, and Trump is doubling down.
[2:57:06.800 --> 2:57:09.800]  He hasn't been intimidated if anything inspired him up.
[2:57:09.800 --> 2:57:18.800]  The symbolism of him taking off the business jacket, putting on the bomber jacket and uttering the word strategic patience in the South Pacific is a real message to China.
[2:57:18.800 --> 2:57:20.800]  And that's why he's going to meet with...
[2:57:20.800 --> 2:57:25.800]  Well, listen, Paul Watson's coming up, and I've got a few clips I've got to play before that happens of stuff I promised to air.
[2:57:25.800 --> 2:57:31.800]  But you should come on, because I know you've got good information today, if you can, with Owen sometime and tomorrow.
[2:57:31.800 --> 2:57:34.800]  We should just get this happening now. So thank you so much, Zach.
[2:57:34.800 --> 2:57:37.800]  We put you on hold. I want to get you on with Owen, if you can do it, or David Knight tomorrow.
[2:57:37.800 --> 2:57:41.800]  As much as possible, I want you to flesh this out for folks, because you're dead on.
[2:57:41.800 --> 2:57:43.800]  We've got to be bracing for the new attacks.

[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:59.800]  Here is an important report by Gavin Wintz dealing with a new Netflix series marking the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution called Damnation Celebrating Communist Evil.
[3:00:59.800 --> 3:01:03.800]  So it's all meant to coordinate with what you're about to witness in this country. Here it is.
[3:01:03.800 --> 3:01:09.800]  Today Netflix releases the first episode of their new series Damnation.
[3:01:09.800 --> 3:01:13.800]  Our banks and government have all conspired.
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:17.800]  I say we call them a miracle, a revolution.
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:29.800]  This is a war between the people of this country, those who side with wealth and power must be recognized for what they are.
[3:01:29.800 --> 3:01:31.800]  The enemy.
[3:01:31.800 --> 3:01:44.800]  So why am I talking about some silly Netflix show?
[3:01:44.800 --> 3:01:54.800]  The series was ordered into production of May of this year, and it's being produced by one of the producers of Game of Thrones, and they only gave them five months to produce the series.
[3:01:54.800 --> 3:02:00.800]  And why did it desperately need to be aired so soon? And why November 7th?
[3:02:00.800 --> 3:02:05.800]  Oh, because it promotes alt-left antifa, resist propaganda.
[3:02:05.800 --> 3:02:18.800]  It stars a preacher as the main character who goes around preaching and sparking up resentment and essentially a communist revolt amongst the working class during the 1930s.
[3:02:18.800 --> 3:02:25.800]  Not only is it anti-capitalism in nature, but the film is also about class warfare.
[3:02:25.800 --> 3:02:35.800]  This series is about the fight against the rich people and the fight against capitalism and those darn white racist people in America.
[3:02:35.800 --> 3:02:42.800]  So why should we be concerned about this new series that's pushing anti-capitalist pro-communist propaganda?
[3:02:42.800 --> 3:02:59.800]  It's because we live in America and we have a large amount of zombie idiots that subjectively will soak all of this BS into their minds and we will have more protesters out there on the streets hating America, hating capitalism,
[3:02:59.800 --> 3:03:06.800]  hating white people and hating rich people or people that they just perceive as racist.
[3:03:06.800 --> 3:03:17.800]  Alex Jones is a racist, Alex Jones is a racist. And of course, Damnation wouldn't be the alt-left series that it is today without feminist propaganda.
[3:03:17.800 --> 3:03:22.800]  Blessed are the meek, so they shall inherit the earth.
[3:03:27.800 --> 3:03:29.800]  A reputation to uphold.
[3:03:29.800 --> 3:03:37.800]  One, you have the preacher's wife who's discontented to strut with being a housewife.
[3:03:37.800 --> 3:03:49.800]  I mean, she just makes those cakes too dry and she just can't live up to this role that she's supposed to be in because being a traditional woman, a mother, that's so unfulfilling.
[3:03:49.800 --> 3:04:00.800]  The second woman heroine character has a much more fulfilling role. She's an African-American prostitute. Wow, that's so much more fulfilling and invigorating.
[3:04:00.800 --> 3:04:08.800]  So being a whore and breaking from traditional roles by shooting up capitalist, industrialists is so feminist.
[3:04:08.800 --> 3:04:18.800]  CNN even writes about the controversial series acknowledging the hostility towards capitalism and its class warfare promoting nature.
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:31.800]  So essentially, Netflix hired some Game of Thrones producers to produce an anti-capitalist, essentially pro-communist series full of alt-left Antifa propaganda.
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:41.800]  Okay, Netflix, since you dislike capitalism so much, then you shouldn't mind pro-capitalist Americans boycotting your stupid series.
[3:04:41.800 --> 3:04:49.800]  Absolutely. I mean, look, it basically celebrates what happened in Texas. And that's it. Just go out and tell a bunch of wights or kill-cretions.
[3:04:49.800 --> 3:05:13.800]  And you're a woman, so it's cool when you blow people's heads off.
[3:05:20.800 --> 3:05:29.800]  Out of stock is back in stock. 25% off our flagship product. Also, biome, defense, the great probiotic, that is 25% off as well.
[3:05:29.800 --> 3:05:33.800]  So a lot of things are selling out, but a lot of things are still at record sales.
[3:05:33.800 --> 3:05:42.800]  Like Silver Bullet, super high quality colloidal silver is still 50% off, and there's other sales that are still going, but they're all about to end.
[3:05:42.800 --> 3:05:52.800]  Whether it's DNA Force, or whether it's Silver Bullet, it's all available right now at infowarslife.com, or by calling toll-free, 888-253-3139.
[3:06:13.800 --> 3:06:24.800]  All right, I'm handing the baton to Paul Joseph Watson, ladies and gentlemen, and we're going to kick off a special 34-hour broadcast starting tomorrow to celebrate the big victory against the globalists.
[3:06:24.800 --> 3:06:34.800]  It's now spreading worldwide. There's Paul Watson right there, ladies and gentlemen, in the bullpen with explosive new information and documentation coming up.
[3:06:34.800 --> 3:06:39.800]  But first, I mentioned this a lot. I'm going to play it. I want to get this lady on. Only know her name's Miss Parker.
[3:06:39.800 --> 3:06:44.800]  Congressman flips out on pro-life activists after she schools him on abortion.
[3:06:44.800 --> 3:06:50.800]  I want to play this, and then hand the baton to Paul Joseph Watson, our great editor of infowars.com.
[3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:59.800]  But first, here is a lady standing up for all human life, all red blood, which unites us, a beautiful black lady.
[3:06:59.800 --> 3:07:09.800]  Suggest I'm disingenuous shows your ignorance or your absolute inability to deal with congresspeople the way they should.
[3:07:09.800 --> 3:07:12.800]  Congressman Cohen, he's called for me to be shut down.
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:28.800]  Miss Parker, you brought a comparison between slavery and abortion, and as far as I recall, that's the first of that type of testimony that I have seen before this committee or any committee.
[3:07:28.800 --> 3:07:35.800]  Is that an original thought on your part? Have you had others that index the same comparison? How did this come about?
[3:07:35.800 --> 3:07:43.800]  Others have looked at it as well, and in fact, when you put the Dred Scott decision next to the Roe v. Wade decision, they read almost verbatim.
[3:07:43.800 --> 3:07:54.800]  I'd like to also address something that was brought up earlier, if I may, when it comes to mixing the abortion issue with the challenges that we face in many of our hard-hit communities.
[3:07:54.800 --> 3:08:09.800]  I feel disingenuous that the issues of Medicaid would come up and other opportunities for us to readdress what has happened and broken down in our most distressed zip codes, the way that Planned Parenthood specifically targets these particular zip codes with abortion.
[3:08:09.800 --> 3:08:12.800]  Abortion is the leading cause of death in the black community today.
[3:08:12.800 --> 3:08:27.800]  Since Roe v. Wade was legalized, 20 million humans have been killed inside of the womb of black women, and then on Halloween, Planned Parenthood tweets out that the black women are safest if they abort their child rather than bring it to term.
[3:08:27.800 --> 3:08:42.800]  To the gentleman from Texas who brought up Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, I think that it is important that we put in record that the needs of those that are most vulnerable in society cannot be addressed with abortion.
[3:08:42.800 --> 3:08:56.800]  Abortion feeds a narrative that women are victims, that they have no control over their sexual impulses, and as a result of this narrative being forced down into our hardest-hit communities, we are seeing now recklessness in sexual activity and marriage has collapsed.
[3:08:56.800 --> 3:09:08.800]  In the 50-70% of black adults who are married today, that number is 30%. This is causing a lot more social pathologies that have to be addressed through different types of legislation, not the heartbeat bill.
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:11.800]  The heartbeat bill is to protect the innocent.
[3:09:11.800 --> 3:09:14.800]  Chair, recognize the gentleman from Tennessee, the ranking member.
[3:09:14.800 --> 3:09:31.800]  Thank you. Firstly, we're in filler time waiting for somebody to come testify. I would ask that we allow Ms. Jayapal to do filler as well as the chair, and I'd also like to say that I am not disingenuous about anything I say about Medicaid or Medicare or LIHEAP or SNAP programs.
[3:09:31.800 --> 3:09:48.800]  And to suggest I'm disingenuous shows your ignorance or your absolute inability to deal with Congress people the way they should. I believe in those issues and I think they're proper and to say I'm disingenuous is just wrong and I expect an apology.
[3:09:48.800 --> 3:10:10.800]  By the way, for sharecroppers and black women, many times they were forced to have abortions. But treating people like human garbage who can be picked or chosen to live or picked or chosen to die is the essence of slavery, having no rights is slavery.
[3:10:10.800 --> 3:10:22.800]  And those condescending Democrats, I've never heard anyone equate it with racism. Really? Is that why Margaret Singer set it up to, quote, kill the subhuman black weeds, close quote?
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:31.800]  Or why Lyndon Mates Johnson funded it to break up black families so he could, quote, kill as many as those inwards in the womb as he could?
[3:10:31.800 --> 3:10:47.800]  Is that why MTV weaponized rap music into gangster rap and deployed it? That's all declassified. And Congressman Cohen of Tennessee joins Congressman Wigley of Illinois saying shut info wars down and ban my free speech.
[3:10:47.800 --> 3:11:06.800]  And he said we lied about FEMA camps and about the National Emergency Centers Act that he authored. These men prey on ignorance. These men are monsters.
[3:11:06.800 --> 3:11:10.800]  Paul Joseph Watson, take over my friend.
[3:11:10.800 --> 3:11:24.800]  Thanks, Alex. Yeah, you mentioned the congressman. We got a big article up on info wars dot com right now because it was not only Twitter in that committee hearing which you played yesterday and today, not only Twitter that brazenly admitted they were
[3:11:24.800 --> 3:11:43.800]  entering info wars. And again, that's that's something that we might have glossed over the fact that they have the general counsel of Twitter, a guy called Sean edgit responding to this congressman and saying, basically, yeah, there was a tweet of an info wars article trending during the NYC terrorist attack on
[3:11:43.800 --> 3:11:55.800]  Twitter saying it was Wednesday last week. And that was bad. And we immediately shut it down and replaced it with mainstream media. He brazenly admitted that and basically said going forward, that's exactly what they're going to do.
[3:11:55.800 --> 3:12:10.800]  Then we had another case on Sunday night when news was breaking about the Texas church massacre, where again, it was one of my tweets saying, look, this is the guy's LinkedIn page. He's into all these typically social justice type issues.
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:24.800]  This is LinkedIn page. It wasn't fake news. That was at the top of some Google search result. For God knows how long. And they had an absolute meltdown. The left, the mainstream media, all these verified people on Twitter, absolute meltdown.
[3:12:24.800 --> 3:12:27.800]  I didn't even know that it was the top of the Google search results.
[3:12:27.800 --> 3:12:42.800]  And by the way, they want to be the ruling class. And then in these incredible videos that you have in your article, they admit we're going to have AI censored people. The heads of Twitter and Google are saying, yes, we're aware that Paul Watson's article was top linked.
[3:12:42.800 --> 3:12:53.800]  We took it down. And then the congressman's like, well, you better move faster next time. And then it's a true story about a famous Imam that goes on Fox News and warned of truck attacks, which happened.
[3:12:53.800 --> 3:13:04.800]  And then the Republican congressman says, this is actually a real article. What are you talking about? So Paul, this is so bombshell and your article's been out for hours. I'm sorry, I didn't report on it more because we won't exist if we don't.
[3:13:04.800 --> 3:13:15.800]  The listeners have to get upset about this. The headline is bombshell. Twitter, Google, Facebook admit plan to censor info wars. We'll put that back on screen, please.
[3:13:15.800 --> 3:13:25.800]  Because again, we tend to look at all the other news, including myself. We look at news wars and info wars like we're chopped liver. This is a really, really important story. It needs to go everywhere.
[3:13:25.800 --> 3:13:34.800]  It's absolutely critical bombshell. Twitter, Google admit deliberately censoring info wars. Why are they so scared of us, Paul?
[3:13:34.800 --> 3:13:45.800]  Because we resonate far easier than they do. It's not rocket science. Just imagine how how big we'd be. And we're not even that big at this point, but just imagine how big we would be if they didn't censor us.
[3:13:45.800 --> 3:13:58.800]  This is with all the algorithm changes. I've talked about it before. Alex used to search for info wars articles when I was writing articles to search for stuff that I'd written in the past that I could refer back to in my articles.
[3:13:58.800 --> 3:14:11.800]  Now, like every other time I searched my own name and info wars and then some other key terms, it's the salon.com hit pieces right at the top. They've changed their entire algorithm to barriers to censors.
[3:14:11.800 --> 3:14:23.800]  And still, still we get to the top because we resonate with people and because people don't trust the mainstream media. They can never claw back that reputation, which is why they want even more severe censorship.
[3:14:23.800 --> 3:14:34.800]  And it all comes back to this. The Democrats, the left created this whole fake news narrative. They created a moral panic. They weaponized it as an excuse because they lost the election.
[3:14:34.800 --> 3:14:41.800]  They're using that to censor alternate viewpoints, even alternate coverage of news, which is completely true.
[3:14:41.800 --> 3:14:50.800]  Paul, they're so disconnected. They're going, yes, I saw him for us at the top at lunch. We took it down. He's like, good, do it quicker.
[3:14:50.800 --> 3:15:00.800]  I mean, it's sensational. It's like seeing the communist Chinese live time in their computers censoring fall on gong. I mean, it's so sensational.
[3:15:00.800 --> 3:15:06.800]  Don't they get the Streisand effect that the more they try to suppress us, the more it explodes.
[3:15:06.800 --> 3:15:14.800]  Well, you saw that a couple of weeks ago when YouTube put my video behind a censorship wall. Luckily, we got someone within YouTube to take a look at it.
[3:15:14.800 --> 3:15:23.800]  And after it came back out of censorship, after we saw the view count again, because of course they hide the view count when they censor it, it got like 300,000 extra views.
[3:15:23.800 --> 3:15:32.800]  So they never learn. Now, with this case, with what happened on Sunday night with the Texas church massacre, Gizmodo, all these other publications ran to triggered about it.
[3:15:32.800 --> 3:15:36.800]  We'll get into it after the break on the Alex Jones show live fourth hour.
[3:15:36.800 --> 3:15:47.800]  We're going to talk about how they are not only censoring, but now it's going to get even more intense because even despite the censorship that's already going on, they're still losing.
[3:15:47.800 --> 3:16:10.800]  We'll be back on the Alex Jones show live fourth hour. Don't go away.

[3:18:52.800 --> 3:19:12.800]  I want to plow into all of this but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material from infowarstore.com, you are funding the revolution.

I want to thank everybody that has but we've got the best chloride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine and you cannot beat that for children and adults.

[3:19:58.800 --> 3:20:24.800]  We are live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[3:20:24.800 --> 3:20:32.800]  We are live. It is the port out of the Alex Jones show. We're talking about this article which is up on infowars.com right now.
[3:20:32.800 --> 3:21:01.800]  Bombshell, Twitter, Google admit deliberately censoring infowars. We talk about internet censorship, social media censorship, constantly on this show because we continue to have to battle it on a weekly basis, kind of get, people get jaded, they don't really respond to it but the fact that we have to continue battling this same tedious issue week after week after week, it kind of derails us from pushing our main narrative but it has to be done because if we didn't then we'd just fold over.
[3:21:01.800 --> 3:21:21.800]  And they'd completely censor us into oblivion. Now of course this emerged out of a House Intelligence Committee hearing into Russian meddling in the presidential election for which there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever but it was a Democratic congressman who was basically triggered by the fact that during the New York City
[3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:36.800]  terrorist attack in Manhattan last week, an infowars.com article came up near the top or at the top of their trending hashtag, which of course was specifically selected by Twitter so it was a particularly big one during that time period.
[3:21:36.800 --> 3:22:00.800]  And the article was about an imam who said he warned Mayor de Blasio in New York about terror radicalization in New York City and of course he later provided the letter showing that he warned him. The imams claim was that the Mayor de Blasio who of course we know went to hang out basically with Antifa in Hamburg, Germany a few months ago during that riot.
[3:22:00.800 --> 3:22:13.800]  His claim was that de Blasio was more concerned about bashing Trump, criticizing Trump and focusing on the very terror radicalization process that was taking place in his own city.
[3:22:13.800 --> 3:22:31.800]  Okay, nothing fake about that news. Was there an imam that made a claim that he warned de Blasio and that in his opinion de Blasio ignored it because he was more concerned with bashing Trump. Yes, yes, yes. Completely true. That's not fake news.
[3:22:31.800 --> 3:22:49.800]  Fake news is when actual fake news websites make up completely inane, insane stories about stuff that provably never happened. There was one last week about Katie Perry saying that I think it was something like necrophilia was good or eating corpses was good or something.
[3:22:49.800 --> 3:23:04.800]  Okay, that's fake news reporting accurately on what a top imam who's verified on Twitter got a huge following said during that New York City terrorist attack reporting on what he said is not fake news.
[3:23:04.800 --> 3:23:13.800]  You can argue and say well de Blasio probably has a lot of things to focus on he didn't ignore it but you can't argue that this imam didn't make that claim.
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:27.800]  That's not fake news. In fact, in these clips that we've already played, the Republican congressman comes back and says that's completely subjective. You can't just say something's fake news because it makes meh de Blasio look bad.
[3:23:27.800 --> 3:23:35.800]  Okay, that's not how it works. But it is how it works for the Democrats. Why they created the term in the first place. That's why they weaponized it.
[3:23:35.800 --> 3:23:46.800]  And I flashed back today on Twitter to an article out of the Observer with the headline. Stanford study finds fake news didn't tip election against Clinton.
[3:23:46.800 --> 3:23:55.800]  They did a huge study Stanford University. Not only did they find that fake news didn't impact the election didn't have enough reach to impact the election.
[3:23:55.800 --> 3:24:07.800]  But the top fake news stories the top two fake news stories that were actually proven fake and had the most traffic during the election period benefited Hillary Clinton.
[3:24:07.800 --> 3:24:17.800]  They were Hillary Clinton positive stories. Most people who believe them, they were the two biggest news stories that most people believe fake news stories.
[3:24:17.800 --> 3:24:27.800]  They were both pro Hillary Clinton. So this entire narrative that fake news helped Donald Trump win. Complete BS. If anything, it helped Hillary Clinton.
[3:24:27.800 --> 3:24:38.800]  That's not info wars saying that Stanford University. Yet they still push this narrative. And of course, they all ganged up on us again on Sunday night.
[3:24:38.800 --> 3:24:49.800]  As I mentioned during the Texas Church massacre, when one of my tweets temporarily got to the top of Google search rankings, which was a post.
[3:24:49.800 --> 3:24:57.800]  One of them was about the fact that the shooter posted an image of a what looked like an AR 15 on his Facebook page. Completely true.
[3:24:57.800 --> 3:25:06.800]  Another one was a screenshot from his LinkedIn page. Completely true. And Gizmodo and all these other verified liberals on Twitter had an absolute meltdown.
[3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:17.800]  Look, 26 people have just been brutally massacred. Could have been way more. And your first concern is who gets the most traffic on Twitter.
[3:25:17.800 --> 3:25:24.800]  That was their first concern. I didn't even know about it until the next day. I didn't know my tweets were top of Google. I don't care.
[3:25:24.800 --> 3:25:35.800]  There's no strategy. I didn't know it until the next day. So then the New York Times contacted me last night and said, Oh, what's your strategy for getting your tweets to the top of Google search rankings?
[3:25:35.800 --> 3:25:43.800]  I responded, I don't have one. I didn't even know until they all freaked out about it in these news reports that I read the next day.
[3:25:43.800 --> 3:25:52.800]  There is no strategy. I'm not gaming the algorithm. I'm simply making interesting, newsworthy, timely tweets.
[3:25:52.800 --> 3:25:59.800]  Now, some people came out in the media aftermath of the shooting before we knew the facts and they were speculating as to the motive and whatever.
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:09.800]  I wasn't even doing that. I was just reporting on what I was seeing from the live media coverage, from all the different reporters that were covering it, the Fox News live stream.
[3:26:09.800 --> 3:26:17.800]  That's all I was doing. And all the people trying to find is social media history while they were deleting it in real time. That's all I was doing.
[3:26:17.800 --> 3:26:26.800]  I wasn't trying to spin a narrative was just covering a breaking news story. That was it. And so it got to the top of Google Twitter search results.
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:35.800]  And they all freaked out because, again, they don't resonate. Not only do they not have a strategy for getting their content out, nobody's interested in their content,
[3:26:35.800 --> 3:26:47.800]  because they don't trust the mainstream media and because they lie and because they just don't have the knack of resonating and knowing what people are going to be interested in when those kind of breaking news events happen.
[3:26:47.800 --> 3:27:00.800]  And again, the whole fake news thing was a moral panic created by the Democrats as yet another excuse for them losing the election. It's been proven to have not had any impact on the election.
[3:27:00.800 --> 3:27:11.800]  Let's read from the actual study, as told in this Observer article, Stanford study finds fake news didn't tip election against Clinton.
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:18.800]  Alcott and Gent's cow, who are the two main researchers said our data suggests social media are not the most important source of election news.
[3:27:18.800 --> 3:27:27.800]  And even the most widely circulated fake news stories were seen by only a fraction, small fraction of Americans.
[3:27:27.800 --> 3:27:39.800]  For fake news to have changed the outcome of the election, a single fake news story would need to have convinced about 0.7% of Clinton voters and non voters who saw it to shift their votes to Trump.
[3:27:39.800 --> 3:27:42.800]  They added the fake news to have changed the outcome of the election.
[3:27:42.800 --> 3:27:50.800]  A single fake article would need to have had the same persuasive effect as 36 television campaign ads than they say.
[3:27:50.800 --> 3:27:52.800]  And it's the sub headline of the article.
[3:27:52.800 --> 3:27:59.800]  Ironically, the most widely believed fake news stories were those that benefited Hillary Clinton.
[3:27:59.800 --> 3:28:04.800]  So again, they can spin this narrative for as long as they like that fake news won Trump the election.
[3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:11.800]  Yes, there is fake news, but it's it's easy to tell the difference between somebody's opinion about something.
[3:28:11.800 --> 3:28:27.800]  As the congressman, the Republican Congressman Chris Stewart said in those videos, it's easy to tell between opinion, a certain take on different breaking news events and outright contrived, obviously phony fake news.
[3:28:27.800 --> 3:28:34.800]  They've conflated the two to try and silence and censor voices that make them look bad.
[3:28:34.800 --> 3:28:35.800]  That's what it's all about.
[3:28:35.800 --> 3:28:40.800]  And they're still pushing this narrative now even at a congressional House committee level.
[3:28:40.800 --> 3:28:43.800]  We'll be back on the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[3:28:43.800 --> 3:28:44.800]  More breaking news coming soon.

[3:34:32.800 --> 3:34:35.800]  They had an absolute meltdown a few days ago.
[3:34:35.800 --> 3:34:42.800]  They found an ad that I had cut for brain force, which by the way, you should also get at infowarsstore.com.
[3:34:42.800 --> 3:34:44.800]  Always use the opportunity to promote it even more.
[3:34:44.800 --> 3:34:48.800]  They had a meltdown over an ad that I cut in April.
[3:34:48.800 --> 3:34:50.800]  What are we now, November?
[3:34:50.800 --> 3:34:56.800]  Like six, seven months ago in April, I cut an ad for brain force and they found it.
[3:34:56.800 --> 3:35:00.800]  Like it was some secret and they were like, oh my God, this is the funniest thing ever.
[3:35:00.800 --> 3:35:06.800]  So they literally had an autistic screeching fit over an ad of me promoting brain force,
[3:35:06.800 --> 3:35:12.800]  which is a new tropic, which like literally half the people in Silicon Valley take,
[3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:14.800]  which everybody has their different brand of.
[3:35:14.800 --> 3:35:18.800]  Oh, but when infowars does it, it's bad and it's funny somehow.
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:24.800]  If that's the best they've got, we advertise products that got five star independent reviews.
[3:35:24.800 --> 3:35:28.800]  They see right there on infowarsstore.com brain force plus.
[3:35:28.800 --> 3:35:30.800]  They had an absolute meltdown.
[3:35:30.800 --> 3:35:32.800]  It was hilarious.
[3:35:32.800 --> 3:35:41.800]  They were so triggered by the fact that they found this ad which has been on the internet for like nearly half a year of me talking about how brain force
[3:35:41.800 --> 3:35:44.800]  gives you mental clarity and more energy.
[3:35:44.800 --> 3:35:49.800]  They wrote advice.com.
[3:35:49.800 --> 3:35:52.800]  This ad is six months old.
[3:35:52.800 --> 3:36:00.800]  Listen, if this is the best they've got against yours truly that I advertised brain force six months ago,
[3:36:00.800 --> 3:36:05.800]  it's like, look, everybody in Silicon Valley takes some kind of new tropic.
[3:36:05.800 --> 3:36:08.800]  This isn't like some hokey snake oil.
[3:36:08.800 --> 3:36:15.800]  I mean, Joe Rogan built his entire podcast on selling his version of the exact same product.
[3:36:15.800 --> 3:36:18.800]  You're going to go after Joe Rogan too.
[3:36:18.800 --> 3:36:24.800]  Absolutely incredible that they had all these massive hissy fits over me making an ad for brain force.
[3:36:24.800 --> 3:36:27.800]  Well, here I'm making another one right now.
[3:36:27.800 --> 3:36:28.800]  You're going to get triggered over this.
[3:36:28.800 --> 3:36:29.800]  Good.
[3:36:29.800 --> 3:36:30.800]  We'll sell even more bottles of it.
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:35.800]  You're literally making infowars and me money with your autistic hissy fits.
[3:36:35.800 --> 3:36:41.800]  Just carry on with your autistic screeching because it's a lot funnier from my perspective.
[3:36:41.800 --> 3:36:42.800]  That's all.
[3:36:42.800 --> 3:36:45.800]  If that's all you've got is quite pathetic at this point.
[3:36:45.800 --> 3:36:47.800]  Get your brain force right now.
[3:36:47.800 --> 3:36:52.800]  Brain force plus personally recommended by me at infowarsstore.com.

[3:36:55.800 --> 3:36:59.800]  You remember the Buzzfeed hit piece, which made us a ton of money by the way.
[3:36:59.800 --> 3:37:00.800]  Thanks Buzzfeed.
[3:37:00.800 --> 3:37:05.800]  Do the same, get your brain force right now at infowarsstore.com.
[3:37:05.800 --> 3:37:07.800]  Directly recommended by me.
[3:37:07.800 --> 3:37:08.800]  Okay.
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:09.800]  I'm proud of it.
[3:37:09.800 --> 3:37:10.800]  All right.
[3:37:10.800 --> 3:37:11.800]  There you go.
[3:37:11.800 --> 3:37:16.800]  So we're going to turn back to the massacre in Texas.
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:19.800]  Absolutely chilling details coming out about that today.
[3:37:19.800 --> 3:37:29.800]  First, though, I want to go to this Trump clip where he's talking about the fact that possibly hundreds more people, if this shooter had been allowed to continue his rampage,
[3:37:29.800 --> 3:37:33.800]  would have been dead right now if not for a responsible person with a firearm.
[3:37:33.800 --> 3:37:35.800]  Let's go to that clip.
[3:37:35.800 --> 3:37:40.800]  You've talked about wanting to put extreme betting on people trying to come into the United States,
[3:37:40.800 --> 3:37:44.800]  but I wonder if you would consider extreme betting for people trying to buy a gun.
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:49.800]  Well, you know, you're bringing up a situation that probably shouldn't be discussed too much right now,
[3:37:49.800 --> 3:37:52.800]  but it's okay if you feel that that's an appropriate question,
[3:37:52.800 --> 3:37:55.800]  even though we're the heart of South Korea.
[3:37:55.800 --> 3:38:01.800]  If you did what you're suggesting, there would have been no difference three days ago.
[3:38:01.800 --> 3:38:13.800]  And you might not have had that very brave person who happened to have a gun or a rifle in his truck go out and shoot him and hit him and neutralize him.
[3:38:13.800 --> 3:38:24.800]  And I can only say this, if he didn't have a gun, instead of having 26 dead, he would have had hundreds more dead.
[3:38:24.800 --> 3:38:27.800]  And are you considering any kind of gun control policy going forward?
[3:38:27.800 --> 3:38:33.800]  The city with the strongest gun laws in our nation is Chicago.
[3:38:33.800 --> 3:38:35.800]  And Chicago is a disaster.
[3:38:35.800 --> 3:38:44.800]  If this man didn't have a gun or a rifle, you'd be talking about a much worse situation in the great state of Texas.
[3:38:44.800 --> 3:38:49.800]  So that's Trump today in South Korea talking about Texas Church massacre.
[3:38:49.800 --> 3:38:52.800]  Of course, he mentions Chicago. I actually worked it out yesterday.
[3:38:52.800 --> 3:38:56.800]  They've had so many gun deaths, and this is just gun deaths alone.
[3:38:56.800 --> 3:38:58.800]  It's not even including all the other murders.
[3:38:58.800 --> 3:39:06.800]  If you take the numbers from the Texas Church massacre, which are tragic, but 26 dead last time we checked,
[3:39:06.800 --> 3:39:11.800]  10 victims are still critical. That number could go higher, but 26 victims dead.
[3:39:11.800 --> 3:39:19.800]  So this year alone, Chicago has had almost 22, the equivalent of 22 Texas Church massacres,
[3:39:19.800 --> 3:39:23.800]  simply from people who've been murdered with guns.
[3:39:23.800 --> 3:39:29.800]  As Trump said, highest, most stringent, strictest gun control regulations in the country,
[3:39:29.800 --> 3:39:34.800]  which suggests to you that it's more of a culture issue than a gun issue.
[3:39:34.800 --> 3:39:40.800]  Now, of course, the immediate narrative after the massacre was being spewed from all sides by the verified liberals once again.
[3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:43.800]  The NRA is a terrorist group.
[3:39:43.800 --> 3:39:46.800]  Don't just ban guns, ban the NRA.
[3:39:46.800 --> 3:39:53.800]  Well, it turns out, of course, armed citizen who helped stop Texas Church massacre was a former NRA member,
[3:39:53.800 --> 3:39:57.800]  and bang goes your narrative, deflated, gone, gone.
[3:39:57.800 --> 3:40:04.800]  Wearing a lot about the evil NRA in the wake of the Texas Church shooting, which left 26 people dead,
[3:40:04.800 --> 3:40:09.800]  in the eyes of the left, it's the National Rifle Association that shoulders the blame for the carnage.
[3:40:09.800 --> 3:40:18.800]  And you saw all the tweets, 15, 20, 25,000 retweets, they're all viral, ban the NRA, terrorist organization.
[3:40:18.800 --> 3:40:23.800]  Except that's not true at all. In fact, the NRA should be praised for doing exactly what it actually does,
[3:40:23.800 --> 3:40:27.800]  training people how to properly and safely use firearms.
[3:40:27.800 --> 3:40:36.800]  And of course, Stephen Williford is being credited, he's being hailed rightly so as the hero for helping to bring Sunday's mass shooting to an end,
[3:40:36.800 --> 3:40:42.800]  as at least one round from his rifle found a small gap in the perpetrator's body armour
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:47.800]  and caused the killer to drop his weapon and retreat to his vehicle.
[3:40:47.800 --> 3:40:51.800]  And of course, that's when they had the big chase before the police even arrived.
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:55.800]  There was also another individual, another gun owner shooting at him.
[3:40:55.800 --> 3:40:59.800]  He drove away, crashed into a ditch and ended up killing himself.
[3:40:59.800 --> 3:41:07.800]  So an NRA member, an armed responsible NRA member with a gun, stopped this massacre from being even worse.
[3:41:07.800 --> 3:41:13.800]  Remember what? There are at least 50 people in that church who could have been slaughtered.
[3:41:13.800 --> 3:41:21.800]  26 is way bad enough, but it could have been a lot, lot worse if not for this armed responsible individual.
[3:41:21.800 --> 3:41:27.800]  Now, speaking of this incident, and after the break, we're going to play my video, which I put up yesterday,
[3:41:27.800 --> 3:41:31.800]  which asked the pertinent questions which have yet to be answered.
[3:41:31.800 --> 3:41:34.800]  Imagine this, this is the scenario I painted in the video.
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:42.800]  So imagine if an Islamophobe, somebody who hates Muslims, is on Facebook for days and weeks beforehand,
[3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:48.800]  posting how stupid Islam is, how much he hates Muslims, he's posting that over and over again
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:53.800]  to the point where his own friends are blocking him on Facebook because he just won't shut up about it.
[3:41:53.800 --> 3:41:59.800]  Then a few days later, he goes into a mosque and tries to massacre 50 Muslims,
[3:41:59.800 --> 3:42:03.800]  having told us all about how much he hated Muslims over the past several days and weeks.
[3:42:03.800 --> 3:42:08.800]  How do you think the media would react after finding that out?
[3:42:08.800 --> 3:42:15.800]  Would they consider for a second that his motive could have been something to do with the fact that he hated Muslims,
[3:42:15.800 --> 3:42:19.800]  or would they still call it a mystery?
[3:42:19.800 --> 3:42:24.800]  Well, that's exactly what happened in the case of this shooter in Texas.
[3:42:24.800 --> 3:42:31.800]  He posted anti-Christian, basically, hate speech on Facebook for days and weeks beforehand.
[3:42:31.800 --> 3:42:37.800]  He went into a church, he massacred 26 people, tried to kill even more.
[3:42:37.800 --> 3:42:39.800]  Oh, but it's a domestic dispute.
[3:42:39.800 --> 3:42:41.800]  There's no real evidence for that.
[3:42:41.800 --> 3:42:46.800]  He sent a mean text message, I think, to his mother-in-law, but they're not even considering the fact
[3:42:46.800 --> 3:42:51.800]  that this could be an anti-Christian hate crime. We'll get more into that after the breaking news at infowars.com.

[3:44:08.800 --> 3:44:16.800]  Being a conservative, a nationalist, a libertarian, or simply a free speech advocate is truly the counterculture.
[3:44:16.800 --> 3:44:24.800]  The real punk rock is being a patriot, who's pro-America, pro-capitalism, and pro-freedom, who at the same time is tolerance.
[3:44:24.800 --> 3:44:32.800]  Modern liberalism is a counterfeit of Thomas Jefferson's class of a liberalism. They are the anti-liberalists.

[3:47:20.800 --> 3:47:32.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:47:32.800 --> 3:47:39.800]  It is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show. We're still talking about the fallout from this horrific Texas church massacre.
[3:47:39.800 --> 3:47:52.800]  Now, of course, it came out today that the shooter was going around inside the church shooting children and babies who were crying as this whole thing unfolded.
[3:47:52.800 --> 3:48:02.800]  Absolutely chilling, of course. We know the stories of the parents and mothers who tried in vain to shield their own children from the bullets.
[3:48:02.800 --> 3:48:10.800]  Now, even more horrific details are coming out about this, which is why we need to try harder than ever to get to the root of the motivation.
[3:48:10.800 --> 3:48:15.800]  We've been told it was a domestic dispute. There's not really been any other information.
[3:48:15.800 --> 3:48:25.800]  A report from CNN says that Kelly, the shooter, had sent threatening text messages to his mother-in-law who occasionally attended the Sutherland Springs Church.
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:32.800]  Because she didn't attend on the day he carried out the massacre, his grandmother-in-law was among those killed.
[3:48:32.800 --> 3:48:39.800]  But it appears that she was the only relation to the shooter who was actually in the church at the time of the massacre.
[3:48:39.800 --> 3:48:48.800]  Now, it turns out that he, after beating up his ex-wife and child, had escaped from a mental hospital in 2012.
[3:48:48.800 --> 3:48:53.800]  But of course, I come back again to these anti-Christian Facebook posts.
[3:48:53.800 --> 3:48:58.800]  A number of his friends and I talked to one of them who basically said that he hated Christians.
[3:48:58.800 --> 3:49:02.800]  He was a militant atheist back at school. He was an emo kid.
[3:49:02.800 --> 3:49:06.800]  And no, that doesn't mean that all emo kids are going to be mass shooters.
[3:49:06.800 --> 3:49:10.800]  We all went through those kind of periods at school. I mean, I was a grunge kid.
[3:49:10.800 --> 3:49:17.800]  Everybody kind of went through a period where they were, you know, part of not, maybe not part of the in-crowd, part of the fringe crowd.
[3:49:17.800 --> 3:49:20.800]  Differences. You get over that. OK, you mature.
[3:49:20.800 --> 3:49:29.800]  This is what I posted on Twitter earlier today. I think a big thing with these mass shooters is we have a serious problem in society of young people
[3:49:29.800 --> 3:49:33.800]  in this atomized society where people have less connection with each other.
[3:49:33.800 --> 3:49:41.800]  This narcissistic culture that encourages young men to be adolescents well into their late 20s and 30s.
[3:49:41.800 --> 3:49:45.800]  So they walk around with this aggrieved attitude that they're the victim.
[3:49:45.800 --> 3:49:50.800]  And yeah, that's fine when you're aged 13 to 18, when you're an emo kid.
[3:49:50.800 --> 3:49:54.800]  You know, a lot of people go through that stage, but they're carrying it on.
[3:49:54.800 --> 3:49:58.800]  And social media helps them do this. This narcissistic culture helps them do this.
[3:49:58.800 --> 3:50:06.800]  This idea that you can attain fame by carrying out an atrocity, which the media plays into, contributes to this.
[3:50:06.800 --> 3:50:14.800]  And again, most of these mass shooters, it turns out, they're man babies who never get past this teenage emo grunge goth stage.
[3:50:14.800 --> 3:50:19.800]  They have arrested development. They turn to nihilism. They turn to despair.
[3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:26.800]  And again, they carry out atrocities to gain instant, even if it's posthumous, but instant fame.
[3:50:26.800 --> 3:50:31.800]  Let's go to the video, what they're not telling you about the Texas Church massacre. Here it is.
[3:50:31.800 --> 3:50:38.800]  At least 26 people were killed and 20 wounded when a gunman opened fire inside a church in southern Springs, Texas.
[3:50:38.800 --> 3:50:44.800]  And of course, both left and right immediately began blaming the massacre on their own respective enemies,
[3:50:44.800 --> 3:50:51.800]  by conflating it with all white people, all left-wingers, all right-wingers, all atheists, whoever they hate the most.
[3:50:51.800 --> 3:50:59.800]  Now, hands up, I've been at fault for that in the past, too. But let's be honest, it's not only callous, it's just incredibly tedious at this point.
[3:50:59.800 --> 3:51:06.800]  But by the same token, the need to understand the motives and factors behind the attack serves two purposes.
[3:51:06.800 --> 3:51:15.800]  One, it gives us some clues to try to prevent it from happening again, and two, it at least offers some explanation, however twisted, of why it happened.
[3:51:15.800 --> 3:51:21.800]  Which is also a psychological coping mechanism that humans crave after every senseless incident like this.
[3:51:21.800 --> 3:51:24.800]  So what do we know about the motive at this point?
[3:51:24.800 --> 3:51:30.800]  The gunman was a committed atheist who bothered his friends on Facebook by incessantly calling Christians stupid.
[3:51:30.800 --> 3:51:40.800]  And that doesn't mean all atheists bear responsibility. Just as the blame for Dylan Roof's massacre shouldn't have been put on all white people, or all Christians, as many did.
[3:51:40.800 --> 3:51:43.800]  But what it does mean is that this could have been an anti-Christian hate crime.
[3:51:43.800 --> 3:51:52.800]  Imagine this, an Islamophobe relentlessly posts on Facebook about how stupid Muslims are, then goes and shoots up a mosque massacring 26 Muslims.
[3:51:52.800 --> 3:51:55.800]  Would the media say his motive was a mystery?
[3:51:55.800 --> 3:52:01.800]  No, if it was just a personal dispute, why try to slaughter everyone in the church?
[3:52:01.800 --> 3:52:09.800]  Now it may come out that there was a personal motive, but if they come out and claim it had nothing to do with his hatred of Christians, it's gonna look very odd.
[3:52:09.800 --> 3:52:13.800]  What role, if any, did mind altering SSRI drugs play in this massacre?
[3:52:13.800 --> 3:52:20.800]  Medication that creates a disassociative mood that puts people in an emotionally dead, trans-like state.
[3:52:20.800 --> 3:52:25.800]  Remember, the significant majority of mass shooters in the US have been on SSRI drugs.
[3:52:25.800 --> 3:52:38.800]  But the media never wants to talk about it because pharmaceutical giants who produce drugs like Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil spend around $2.4 billion on direct-to-consumer television advertising every single year.
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:43.800]  The reaction to the shooting from the alt-left was, of course, completely predictable.
[3:52:43.800 --> 3:52:49.800]  They labelled the NRA a terrorist group despite no mass shooting having ever been carried out by an NRA member.
[3:52:49.800 --> 3:52:55.800]  They blamed the Second Amendment and gun owners despite the fact that it was a responsible armed citizen who stopped the attack.
[3:52:55.800 --> 3:53:01.800]  They blamed all white people despite the fact that white people are actually underrepresented in mass shootings.
[3:53:01.800 --> 3:53:06.800]  They were also angry at me because Google linked to some of my tweets.
[3:53:06.800 --> 3:53:13.800]  Right, so 26 people have just been slaughtered and your first concern is who's getting the most traffic to their tweets.
[3:53:13.800 --> 3:53:18.800]  And speaking of tweets, some of them were almost as soul-crushingly depraved as the attack itself.
[3:53:18.800 --> 3:53:22.800]  The murdered victims were in a church. If prayers did anything, they'd be alive. You were for a sack of sh**.
[3:53:22.800 --> 3:53:30.800]  Right, so your gut reaction to 26 Christians being massacred is to insult Christians and Christianity. That's horrible.
[3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:35.800]  Sutherland Springs is in rural Texas. These are all likely 45 voters. This is karma in action. Good riddance.
[3:53:35.800 --> 3:53:37.800]  Oh, and the children who died?
[3:53:37.800 --> 3:53:38.800]  You gotta crack eggs to make an omelette.
[3:53:38.800 --> 3:53:40.800]  No words. Just no words.
[3:53:40.800 --> 3:53:46.800]  Innocent people go to church on Sunday to honour their god and while doing so get shot and killed. What country? America. Why? Republicans!
[3:53:46.800 --> 3:53:51.800]  Statistically, 72% of the victims were Republicans. Probably more.
[3:53:51.800 --> 3:53:59.800]  So hashtag not all Muslims that's a blame for terror, but all Republicans that's a blame for one guy shooting up a church full of mostly Republicans.
[3:53:59.800 --> 3:54:05.800]  James T. Hodgkinson, a Democrat, just tried to massacre a bunch of Republicans five months ago.
[3:54:05.800 --> 3:54:11.800]  They were still removing the dead bodies from the church when she tweeted that. Let that sink in.
[3:54:11.800 --> 3:54:16.800]  Don't worry, everybody. It was a white man who slaughtered half the church in Texas. That means everything's just fine. No terrorism.
[3:54:16.800 --> 3:54:25.800]  First off, if your response to the slaughter of 26 white people is to get on Twitter and spew anti-white racism, take a serious look in the frigging mirror.
[3:54:25.800 --> 3:54:31.800]  And if he did it because he hated Christians, then it was terrorism. You relentless prick.
[3:54:31.800 --> 3:54:36.800]  Terrorism is based on motive, not skin colour. How many times do I have to say it?
[3:54:36.800 --> 3:54:41.800]  Let's be honest here. The West in general has a massive problem with Islamic terrorism.
[3:54:41.800 --> 3:54:49.800]  America has a massive problem with mass shootings. And people downplay or exaggerate one or the other based on their politics.
[3:54:49.800 --> 3:54:52.800]  Why can't we just acknowledge that both are a huge problem?
[3:54:52.800 --> 3:54:58.800]  And whereas with Islamic terrorists, the attackers are motivated by the promise of a glorious afterlife,
[3:54:58.800 --> 3:55:03.800]  domestic mass shooters seem to be motivated by the belief that there is no afterlife.
[3:55:03.800 --> 3:55:12.800]  They're bathed in a culture that exalts narcissism and the idea that anyone can achieve instant fame and that fame is all that matters.
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:16.800]  Not through talent or hard work, but by generating mindless controversy.
[3:55:16.800 --> 3:55:21.800]  The ultimate extreme example of which is by carrying out an atrocity.
[3:55:21.800 --> 3:55:28.800]  And the media instantly provides these losers with the posthumous celebrity that they craved their entire life.
[3:55:28.800 --> 3:55:35.800]  I had 20 years of mass murders throughout which I have repeatedly told CNN and our other media,
[3:55:35.800 --> 3:55:43.800]  if you don't want to propagate more mass murders, don't start the story with Sirens blaring.
[3:55:43.800 --> 3:55:47.800]  The school day had only just begun, but the attacker struck.
[3:55:47.800 --> 3:55:49.800]  Don't have photographs of the killer.
[3:55:49.800 --> 3:55:53.800]  The 17-year-old's 3-hour rampage ended in his own death.
[3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:56.800]  Don't make this 24-7 coverage.
[3:55:56.800 --> 3:56:00.800]  The German chancellor is about to give her reaction. We'll bring that to you live.
[3:56:00.800 --> 3:56:06.800]  Do everything you can not to make the body count the lead story.
[3:56:06.800 --> 3:56:10.800]  Carnage in the classroom. 16 people are dead.
[3:56:10.800 --> 3:56:14.800]  Not to make the killer some kind of anti-hero.
[3:56:14.800 --> 3:56:18.800]  Dressed in black combat gear, the gunman opened fire at random.
[3:56:18.800 --> 3:56:25.800]  Do localize this story to the affected community and make it as boring as possible in every other market.
[3:56:25.800 --> 3:56:32.800]  Every time we have intense saturation coverage of a mass murder, we expect to see one or two more within a week.
[3:56:32.800 --> 3:56:38.800]  But how can we stop turning mass shooters into macabre celebrities without limiting press freedom?
[3:56:38.800 --> 3:56:40.800]  It's virtually impossible.
[3:56:40.800 --> 3:56:46.800]  As opposed to Islamic terrorists whose entire existence is enriched with meaning, however barbaric it seems to us,
[3:56:46.800 --> 3:56:54.800]  the domestic mass shooters radicalization process seems to stem from a vacuum of meaning and purpose in life.
[3:56:54.800 --> 3:56:57.800]  A vacuum that's easily filled by despair and nihilism.
[3:56:57.800 --> 3:57:03.800]  I think we need to dig deeper and realize that these kids come from a culture that's lost faith in itself.
[3:57:03.800 --> 3:57:10.800]  Society is becoming more and more atomized and that lack of empathy and cohesion is sure to produce one thing.
[3:57:10.800 --> 3:57:16.800]  Lonely, isolated, alienated monsters who lash out with brutal, bloody resentment.
[3:57:16.800 --> 3:57:21.800]  Please celebrate the lives of the victims. Please celebrate the heroes.
[3:57:21.800 --> 3:57:23.800]  The mother who died while protecting her young children.
[3:57:23.800 --> 3:57:27.800]  The residents who chased the gunmen away, preventing an even higher death toll.
[3:57:27.800 --> 3:57:54.800]  Please donate to the Sutherland Springs Church via the link in the description.
