[00:00.000 --> 00:20.920]  the world is a dangerous place not because of evil but because of those who look on and
[00:20.920 --> 00:22.840]  do nothing.
[00:22.840 --> 00:27.200]  If you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance.
[00:27.200 --> 00:33.880]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33.880 --> 00:40.960]  Well Alec Manasian is from somewhere in the Middle East, it could be an Iranian name,
[00:40.960 --> 00:45.160]  it could be a Turkish name, it could be an Armenian name, but we know when somebody
[00:45.160 --> 00:51.240]  runs over a bunch of people on purpose with a truck, always with a rental van or a stolen
[00:51.240 --> 01:01.600]  18-wheeler, 99% of the time it is a Muslim, but the media won't even say, not even on
[01:01.600 --> 01:08.720]  Fox News, could it be an Islamic terror attack, but what's even crazier is, the video that
[01:08.720 --> 01:14.640]  surfaced last night shot out of a car where he's pulling out what looks like a gun and
[01:14.640 --> 01:20.520]  aiming it at police saying I have a gun, I'm gonna shoot you, you can hear his far and
[01:20.520 --> 01:31.120]  thick Middle Eastern accent and he's pointing a gun at the cop and the cops have all got
[01:31.120 --> 01:37.560]  guns on him and I guess they've got that thing that they witnessed in Vietnam and many other
[01:37.560 --> 01:43.000]  wars that up close people are afraid to kill folks, so they developed the first video games
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.720]  in the 60s that were in big stand up projection rooms that you went through that were like
[01:47.720 --> 01:52.720]  the video game Doom, that's what Doom's based on, was a later program that was deployed
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.000]  to the public to cause instinctive shooting and to not hesitate and they got about 99%
[01:58.000 --> 02:02.600]  kill rates up close and that's why these video games are murder simulators, I'm not saying
[02:02.600 --> 02:06.920]  censor them, the video gamers go how dare you call for censoring, no, no, no, your video
[02:06.920 --> 02:13.040]  games are based on killing simulators for the Army and Marine Corps, fact, fact, fact
[02:13.040 --> 02:19.920]  developed by DARPA, just a little side issue.
[02:19.920 --> 02:25.000]  So the police sit there when he appears to have a gun in his hand saying I'm gonna shoot
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.560]  you and they don't shoot him, it is insane, the footage is up on infowars.com, it's on
[02:31.560 --> 02:34.720]  newswars.com, if you're a radio listener you want to see it, obviously we're simulcasting
[02:34.720 --> 02:39.960]  on TV so a lot of you can see it right now, but unbelievable, I mean you pull a gun on
[02:39.960 --> 02:44.720]  me or it looks like one, you say you're gonna shoot me, I'm going to shoot you, I don't
[02:44.720 --> 02:47.600]  need to go play video games, I don't know how to do that, I want to live and go home
[02:47.600 --> 02:56.920]  to mama and the babies, but just wild to see the police sit there and I'm asking the question,
[02:56.920 --> 03:06.640]  why is this guy not dead and why haven't we learned his religion, I mean I spent time
[03:06.640 --> 03:13.840]  last night, I spent time this morning looking and looking and looking and every time an
[03:13.840 --> 03:18.320]  Islamist kills somebody in Germany or Sweden or the Netherlands or England, it's always
[03:18.320 --> 03:27.840]  a London man, a German man blew up people entering the soccer game, a German man ran
[03:27.840 --> 03:37.280]  over people at the Christmas outdoor fair, a British man blew up a bunch of teenagers
[03:37.280 --> 03:44.920]  at a pop rock concert, when it's a Muslim it's always a German man, an American man,
[03:44.920 --> 03:50.680]  a British man, never a Muslim and I don't like the political correctness, the biggest
[03:50.680 --> 03:59.320]  victims of Islam are Muslims, that's why they're all trying to come here and we're supposed
[03:59.320 --> 04:04.800]  to roll over to it and coming up, I've got a big stack of news that ties into this,
[04:04.800 --> 04:16.080]  the great exodus out of America's blue cities and it just deals with blue cities, everyone
[04:16.080 --> 04:21.400]  is fleeing as fast as they can but then they don't understand consciously most of them
[04:21.400 --> 04:27.120]  are fleeing, globalism, socialism, crony capitalism, the elites, the corruption, they bring it
[04:27.120 --> 04:37.800]  here like they're fleeing smallpox or they're fleeing the plague but then they bring it
[04:37.800 --> 04:43.400]  here like the plague was carried on fleas on rats and it's like we're fleeing the plague,
[04:43.400 --> 04:48.320]  here let's bring a bunch of the rats with us and come to Austin and piss all over everyone
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.280]  and it ties into all of this, it just ties into all of it and why is every blue city,
[04:54.280 --> 05:00.880]  blue state, blue country collapsing in hell, stay with us.
[05:00.880 --> 05:06.480]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life, Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
[05:06.480 --> 05:12.440]  and protection, mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy, they are your body's cellular
[05:12.440 --> 05:15.920]  engines Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy
[05:15.920 --> 05:21.080]  production by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul because when
[05:21.080 --> 05:26.480]  your mitochondria don't run at 100% efficiency then they start producing reactive oxygen
[05:26.480 --> 05:32.800]  species, top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting
[05:32.800 --> 05:39.280]  from these reactive oxygen species, the antioxidants found in Cell Force are some of the most powerful
[05:39.280 --> 05:44.720]  available on the market, the stronger the antioxidant the better its ability to scavenge for these
[05:44.720 --> 05:51.880]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals, boost, protect and adapt with Cell Force from

[06:21.720 --> 06:31.120]  Fashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[06:31.120 --> 06:38.120]  In 99% of the truck attacks, it turns out to be an Islamist, but in all of those attacks
[06:38.120 --> 06:45.240]  the media says truck attack, truck kills 80 plus people and injures 200 in Nice France,
[06:45.240 --> 06:54.640]  truck kills 30 plus people and injures 70 plus in German attack, in French attack, in
[06:54.640 --> 07:03.320]  Spanish attack, in Brussels Belgium attack, in London England attack, on and on and on,
[07:03.320 --> 07:12.320]  but now it's developing that Alec Monassian who again has a pre-Islamic name meaning
[07:12.320 --> 07:16.400]  a lot of people in the area of the world have names that came along before Mohammed, so
[07:16.400 --> 07:20.960]  it's either Iranian, Turkish, Armenian, something like that and they're now saying well he might
[07:20.960 --> 07:28.880]  have been autistic, he might have been mentally ill, well that sounds like Islam to me and
[07:28.880 --> 07:35.320]  again folks from these countries, I'm sorry it's a fact, have thousands and thousands
[07:35.320 --> 07:43.360]  and thousands and thousands and thousands of times higher mental illness and congenital
[07:43.360 --> 07:49.840]  deformities of the brain, of the bones, of the heart, of the eyes, it's a fact.
[07:49.840 --> 07:53.240]  Why does the British royal family?
[07:53.240 --> 07:56.240]  For every successful member of the royal family, they got three or four, they've got
[07:56.240 --> 08:02.360]  to hide until they start to quote marrying commoners in just the last two generations
[08:02.360 --> 08:08.120]  because of inbreeding, why did the Egyptians look like space aliens, I've gone and seen
[08:08.120 --> 08:13.120]  their mummies, their bones, a lot of people, UFOologists go look it's a space alien, no
[08:13.120 --> 08:19.400]  it's well known deformity, when you marry your sister for 15 generations, he will ascend
[08:19.400 --> 08:24.080]  it to the sun, the next great pharaoh and you're like this pharaoh is nine years old,
[08:24.080 --> 08:29.400]  this one's 12, this one's 13 when they died, this one's 16, why one known as the great
[08:29.400 --> 08:36.800]  gold eagle, he lived to 30, I thought he was really a god because you don't marry your
[08:36.800 --> 08:42.960]  sister and then marry your sister again and then marry your sister again, you do that
[08:42.960 --> 08:48.400]  one time, it's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of percentage points that you're
[08:48.400 --> 08:54.680]  going to have serious deformities or be out of your mind, everybody knows that quote
[08:54.680 --> 09:08.120]  hybrid dogs have mental problems, have deformities, have bizarre neurotic behaviors, it's incredible
[09:08.120 --> 09:13.000]  and that's your problem in the Middle East and Pakistan and everywhere else is that what
[09:13.000 --> 09:17.120]  Pakistani folks in England is the fact are less than one percent of population, they're
[09:17.120 --> 09:25.080]  almost like 36, 37 percent of the deformities registered by the National Health Service,
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.440]  just stop marrying your first cousin over and over again, I know Mohammed did it so it's
[09:30.440 --> 09:41.200]  supposedly okay, it's not good, it's not good, it's not good in Appalachia, it's not good
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.360]  when they used to do it in Alabama, I mean I've been in areas of the south, great people,
[09:46.360 --> 09:51.280]  nice whatever, really small towns in Texas and man you walk in a grocery store or something
[09:51.280 --> 10:02.360]  and it's like whoa, the genetic mutations, the chromosomal issues are just dramatic, it's
[10:02.360 --> 10:09.360]  like you've entered a mutant colony and let's just get down to brass tacks, the Muslim religion
[10:09.360 --> 10:21.000]  for 1400 years has created giant armies of inbred insane people, that's it, yeah there
[10:21.000 --> 10:28.480]  it is, deformities from having sex with your cousins and the heavy priced children pay,
[10:28.480 --> 10:37.720]  oh it's a fact, it's an absolute fact that inbreeding is a big, big, big problem and
[10:37.720 --> 10:47.280]  it doesn't matter how good the genetics are you begin with, if you've got inbreeding going
[10:47.280 --> 10:52.040]  on or in the past lines or you're in a community that keeps doing that or a religion that keeps
[10:52.040 --> 11:00.960]  doing that and there are other ones that do it as well to a certain extent, it is very
[11:00.960 --> 11:09.040]  very sad, I've been in New York and gone in and it's in different ethnic neighborhoods
[11:09.040 --> 11:14.080]  than inbreeding and you go in and it's very very sad, you'll be in the business and you'll
[11:14.080 --> 11:22.480]  see all the different genetic deformities and mental illnesses and chromosomal spectrum
[11:22.480 --> 11:32.680]  disorders and then you'll kind of see the upper caste that uses them like worker base
[11:32.680 --> 11:39.480]  and there's a lot of orthodox groups that have this problem and you need to stop it,
[11:39.480 --> 11:53.480]  it's bad, hybrid vigor is an absolute fact that it's good to actually have different
[11:53.480 --> 11:59.080]  human genome types mixing with each other, now you can say well if you take somebody
[11:59.080 --> 12:03.200]  that's really stupid but somebody that's really smart, is that an overall better person against
[12:03.200 --> 12:10.640]  getting disease, against having all sorts of genetic disorders, yes, you may not be
[12:10.640 --> 12:15.960]  as smart, there are some inbreeding programs that create super geniuses but it's a very
[12:15.960 --> 12:21.640]  small percent, you've got to hide everybody else, they had secret British breeding programs
[12:21.640 --> 12:27.840]  that have been declassified as well, the whole modern world got designed by Galton, Wedgwood,
[12:27.840 --> 12:34.480]  Huxley, Darwin, those families married for five generations and it created all this Huxley
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.400]  and Julian Huxley and the UN UNESCO World Government plan but it also created a lot
[12:39.400 --> 12:45.880]  of completely insane people and they wrote about that as well, so the whole transhumanist
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.200]  movement from Julian Huxley that is dominating our world is the new globalist religion,
[12:50.200 --> 12:56.440]  the AI gods that must warns the elite worship, that comes out of a breeding program and out
[12:56.440 --> 13:02.000]  of the insanity and the mental illness of marrying their first cousins and even their
[13:02.000 --> 13:09.600]  sisters because they were tasked by the British royal house who was having problems with
[13:09.600 --> 13:12.680]  interbreeding obviously, they were going to continue interbreeding but they said let's
[13:12.680 --> 13:17.440]  take some of the smartest families in England and interbreed them and see if there's a way
[13:17.440 --> 13:22.920]  to test interbreeding that's not in a normal royal bloodline to be able to do that, I'm
[13:22.920 --> 13:27.640]  going to stop right there, it's just you have to understand so much of the problems, the
[13:27.640 --> 13:35.600]  Hapsburg jaw, so many of the problems in our society and our civilization, see how they
[13:35.600 --> 13:40.240]  look like bin Laden folks, see how they look like the upper crust of the Saudis, they got
[13:40.240 --> 13:47.720]  the Hapsburg jaw, you do it, that's one of the things you get, poor Romanoff gypsies,
[13:47.720 --> 13:50.680]  about half the men have an eye that points the wrong direction, that's a known genetic
[13:50.680 --> 13:57.880]  disorder, these are facts, but I'm digressing, I have so much news to cover today, I said
[13:57.880 --> 14:05.080]  this is an Islamic attack because they always cover up as an Islamic attack, we'll see what
[14:05.080 --> 14:10.600]  thumbs out, we'll see how the media spins this but it's another truck of peace attack,
[14:10.600 --> 14:13.680]  it turns out he's a mentally old person that halfway converted to Islam, they'll say he's
[14:13.680 --> 14:17.560]  a Christian Armenian, you'll hear it's a Christian attack but if it's a Muslim attack they won't
[14:17.560 --> 14:22.880]  say that, they also have copycats, every time there's a mass shooting the next week or so
[14:22.880 --> 14:26.760]  other people try it, where every time somebody jumps off, you know the Empire State Building,
[14:26.760 --> 14:31.280]  the cops know the station police there is for the next week, moral try it, that he keeps
[14:31.280 --> 14:37.200]  hearing about running over people in a truck, so he went out and rented a van and then said
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.480]  in his heavy foreign accent, shoot me, shoot me, let's go ahead and roll some of that audio
[14:42.480 --> 15:06.680]  for TV and radio listeners, so many times they try to cover up the nature of this.
[15:06.680 --> 15:14.360]  I have it gone in my pocket, I have it gone in my pocket but there wasn't the Allah Akbar's
[15:14.360 --> 15:18.760]  so it wasn't an attempt to be death by cop and again if you're a radio listener let me
[15:18.760 --> 15:22.720]  describe the video if you haven't seen it, he says I have it gone in my pocket and then
[15:22.720 --> 15:30.360]  pulls it looks like a gun out and is aiming it at the cop for like 10 seconds and there's
[15:30.360 --> 15:36.280]  nobody behind the guy, he's standing in front of the van, I'm not a bloodthirsty person
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.360]  but I don't want to die, I would have squeezed rounds off in the guy's chest, look the cop
[15:40.360 --> 15:44.760]  froze up, that's all I can say and of course nobody can know unless you're in that situation
[15:44.760 --> 15:48.720]  but I've been in a situation where people pull guns on me and I took them and beat them
[15:48.720 --> 15:54.040]  upside the head with them, I probably wasn't the best move but I didn't have a choice in
[15:54.040 --> 15:59.760]  one case the guy was already rifle weapon my buddy, I wasn't going to wait anymore.
[15:59.760 --> 16:04.760]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels

[19:17.400 --> 19:23.280]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[19:23.280 --> 19:26.600]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:26.600 --> 19:31.520]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[19:31.520 --> 19:36.600]  of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[19:36.600 --> 19:37.600]  symptoms.
[19:37.600 --> 19:41.480]  Pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[19:41.480 --> 19:46.160]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[19:46.160 --> 19:51.960]  triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:51.960 --> 19:54.640]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:54.640 --> 20:02.960]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:02.960 --> 20:23.960]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:23.960 --> 20:27.320]  Waging war on corruption.
[20:27.320 --> 20:49.720]  This is Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[20:49.720 --> 20:52.160]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[20:52.160 --> 20:56.160]  I'm going to give a detailed breakdown on the image that is appearing, the picture that's
[20:56.160 --> 21:04.560]  coming into focus of the truck attacker yesterday adopting an Islamic jihad form of attack there
[21:04.560 --> 21:12.440]  in a very Islamic city of Toronto, the fact that he has a Middle Eastern last name.
[21:12.440 --> 21:17.680]  But more and more another picture is emerging, but it ties into everything we've already
[21:17.680 --> 21:24.960]  been breaking down and has the same similarities culturally that you see in Islam.
[21:24.960 --> 21:29.480]  So this is really intriguing, we've been researching and digging into this and a very interesting
[21:29.480 --> 21:33.120]  picture is emerging coming up in the next segment.
[21:33.120 --> 21:34.120]  I'm going to get into that.
[21:34.120 --> 21:40.040]  We're printing some other articles and things right now, but we're going to be breaking
[21:40.040 --> 21:41.040]  that down.
[21:41.040 --> 21:49.280]  Now, first off, before we go there, I want to just mention to you all of the other insane
[21:49.280 --> 21:54.800]  news that I've absolutely got to cover today.
[21:54.800 --> 21:58.640]  We have Macron coming to the US and a huge love fest with Trump.
[21:58.640 --> 22:00.360]  What does that really signify?
[22:00.360 --> 22:02.240]  Is it important?
[22:02.240 --> 22:06.280]  Macron is playing a double game, acting like a nationalist while still letting France be
[22:06.280 --> 22:09.760]  overrun by Islamists.
[22:09.760 --> 22:13.520]  But he does have courage to come in the face of all the globalists and the leftists and
[22:13.520 --> 22:18.440]  be friends with Trump because he understands that Trump's winning and embrace Trump.
[22:18.440 --> 22:22.860]  Just like Kanye West is, they know the worm is turning.
[22:22.860 --> 22:25.620]  They know Trump is winning.
[22:25.620 --> 22:29.080]  Nationalism and populism is winning, not just here, but globally.
[22:29.080 --> 22:30.520]  We'll be looking at that.
[22:30.520 --> 22:37.120]  Also, Congressional Budget Office projects roast domestic product headed to a 15-year
[22:37.120 --> 22:38.120]  high.
[22:38.120 --> 22:40.400]  Great news on the economy.
[22:40.400 --> 22:45.600]  We're also going to be looking at the new Purge movie.
[22:45.600 --> 22:54.000]  The Purge prequel, where it's modern KKK is the US military and they're coming to kill
[22:54.000 --> 22:55.600]  the poor black people.
[22:55.600 --> 22:57.440]  More Hollywood race war narrative.
[22:57.440 --> 23:00.720]  We're going to be getting into that.
[23:00.720 --> 23:08.760]  Also Pompeo confirmation advances after Rand Paul's reversal.
[23:08.760 --> 23:10.480]  Why did Rand Paul reverse?
[23:10.480 --> 23:15.320]  Because Pompeo has already made the incredible deal with the North Koreans and because Pompeo
[23:15.320 --> 23:23.240]  came out and said the Iraq war was wrong, Afghanistan's wrong, Trump was right when
[23:23.240 --> 23:24.240]  he said that.
[23:24.240 --> 23:27.400]  I agree with the president and I agree we need to exit out of these countries as soon
[23:27.400 --> 23:28.960]  as possible.
[23:28.960 --> 23:31.520]  And so Paul said good.
[23:31.520 --> 23:39.320]  I mean, I like Pompeo in that he was a Freedom Caucus, pro-America, pro-gun, pro-family patriot.
[23:39.320 --> 23:42.160]  Does he have a little bit of a hawkish streak down his back?
[23:42.160 --> 23:43.160]  Yeah.
[23:43.160 --> 23:44.160]  Is he out to get the country?
[23:44.160 --> 23:45.160]  No.
[23:45.160 --> 23:49.360]  That's a good thing that that's advancing.
[23:49.360 --> 23:53.560]  But Buchanan points out America's unsustainable empire and it goes over the statistics and
[23:53.560 --> 23:57.040]  what they're doing to our troops, everything else.
[23:57.040 --> 24:03.400]  Also Tilford grooming scandal, former social services boss, local lawmakers, exposes pedophiles.
[24:03.400 --> 24:06.040]  All over England, even in small towns.
[24:06.040 --> 24:10.720]  The town councils put Muslims in charge as CPS workers.
[24:10.720 --> 24:15.720]  Little kids start disappearing, they pop back up in London and other areas when they're
[24:15.720 --> 24:22.200]  10, 12, 13, 14 as sex slaves after they've been prepared and it's turning out that the
[24:22.200 --> 24:26.120]  town councils are running these to make money and to enjoy themselves.
[24:26.120 --> 24:28.120]  It's a real pedophile cult.
[24:28.120 --> 24:29.400]  But notice they always spin it.
[24:29.400 --> 24:32.000]  Jones claimed there's a pedophile network worldwide.
[24:32.000 --> 24:33.400]  He claims Trump's going to go after it.
[24:33.400 --> 24:35.000]  We told you all that first.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.560]  I told you that when Trump was running.
[24:36.560 --> 24:42.000]  I told, I said that on Joe Rogan's podcast a year and three months ago and all of it's
[24:42.000 --> 24:46.200]  come true tomorrow's news today and it's why they're after us.
[24:46.200 --> 24:48.760]  We are fighting the global pedophile network.
[24:48.760 --> 24:52.680]  They're not all pedophiles, but they use pedophilia to compromise people and you don't
[24:52.680 --> 24:55.080]  get in the club unless you do.
[24:55.080 --> 25:00.560]  We've all heard about the more elite of fraternity is, you know, it's not just have sex with
[25:00.560 --> 25:01.560]  the prostitute.
[25:01.560 --> 25:04.080]  It's not just have sex with a goat.
[25:04.080 --> 25:08.640]  It's have sex with the other members of the fraternity, the male members.
[25:08.640 --> 25:10.520]  And it's not even a homosexual thing.
[25:10.520 --> 25:16.200]  It's like in Team America, because it's not about sex Gary now get down there and do it.
[25:16.200 --> 25:18.040]  It's about dominance.
[25:18.040 --> 25:19.040]  It's about power.
[25:19.040 --> 25:21.240]  It's why it's such an accurate movie.
[25:21.240 --> 25:26.640]  No way out with Kevin Costner and my favorite actor, Gene Hagman, which just comes to acting
[25:26.640 --> 25:31.720]  love Charlton has some Gene Hagman's the best and that's how it all works.
[25:31.720 --> 25:37.600]  And it's like, you don't want to have sex with the man, then you're not in the club.
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.240]  And then once you do that, it's now you're going to have sex with a goat.
[25:41.240 --> 25:45.120]  We're going to videotape it and it's about having you compromised.
[25:45.120 --> 25:48.000]  And then you get at the higher levels and it's going to have sex with a 16 year old
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.440]  girl and they've had top bankers globalist go public and break this down.
[25:51.440 --> 25:54.720]  And then it's you're going to have sex with a 13 year old girl and you're like, I don't
[25:54.720 --> 25:55.720]  want to do that.
[25:55.720 --> 25:57.960]  I can't get aroused.
[25:57.960 --> 26:03.560]  Well, you're going to do it or you're not getting the banking contract.
[26:03.560 --> 26:07.320]  And then next you're going to have sex with an eight year old boy.
[26:07.320 --> 26:12.840]  And then next you're going to rape and strangle a two year old baby girl.
[26:12.840 --> 26:19.840]  Now that's, and then, oh, that point you're Trump has not done any of that.
[26:19.840 --> 26:22.440]  Trump has never done anything.
[26:22.440 --> 26:23.440]  There's no dirt.
[26:23.440 --> 26:32.320]  It's full grown, 30 year old, just over the top powerful women that intimidate most men.
[26:32.320 --> 26:37.080]  I've been around Melania Trump a few times, you know, just two feet away.
[26:37.080 --> 26:42.880]  And it's like the star power is like, she's intimidating and I've never had a woman intimidate.
[26:42.880 --> 26:45.560]  You know, when I was like 14 years old, I was sitting there looking my lips, looking
[26:45.560 --> 26:48.320]  at the 30 year old teacher and I was to be honest.
[26:48.320 --> 26:49.600]  And I always liked like Trump.
[26:49.600 --> 26:53.280]  I liked the full grown, full horse power women.
[26:53.280 --> 26:57.880]  These weird globalists, you know, like little girls, it's gross, but they want to steal
[26:57.880 --> 26:59.920]  the innocence.
[26:59.920 --> 27:01.360]  So you're getting the big secrets here.
[27:01.360 --> 27:02.360]  We're going to be breaking this down.
[27:02.360 --> 27:10.840]  And it's why they hate us so much because I'm not into kids, Trump's not into kids.
[27:10.840 --> 27:17.640]  And these people run the show, the British role family, all of them.
[27:17.640 --> 27:20.600]  And how far you'll get compromised is how far you'll go.
[27:20.600 --> 27:25.560]  And again, every other criminal organization operates this way where you got to commit
[27:25.560 --> 27:27.320]  crimes.
[27:27.320 --> 27:30.960]  You got to finally kill an innocent person just to make sure you'll do it.
[27:30.960 --> 27:33.200]  And so you're compromised.
[27:33.200 --> 27:34.360]  You got to shoot the old lady.
[27:34.360 --> 27:37.920]  You got to shoot the liquor store owner.
[27:37.920 --> 27:42.160]  And the worst, the cult, the worst, the gang, they always had rules in Mexico and Latin
[27:42.160 --> 27:43.160]  America.
[27:43.160 --> 27:44.160]  Don't kill kids.
[27:44.160 --> 27:50.520]  You know, the whole Tony Montana line and the screenplay writer on that famously went
[27:50.520 --> 27:56.320]  to Latin America for years before he had to end Cuba and spent time there, Oliver Stone,
[27:56.320 --> 28:01.360]  four years writing that screenplay, Tony Montana says, no woman, no kids.
[28:01.360 --> 28:04.280]  And at the end of the movie, he gives it all up because he still has a conscience.
[28:04.280 --> 28:07.240]  He was only killing other drug dealers and other men at that point.
[28:07.240 --> 28:11.520]  He still had a chivalry and he won't blow up the guy with the daughters in front of
[28:11.520 --> 28:12.520]  the U.N.
[28:12.520 --> 28:13.520]  Building.
[28:13.520 --> 28:16.800]  And so he gets killed, but he keeps his honor.
[28:16.800 --> 28:18.680]  That is exactly how this is.
[28:18.680 --> 28:21.120]  No women, no kids.
[28:21.120 --> 28:23.680]  If you're not into hurting women and kids, you don't get the club.
[28:23.680 --> 28:29.400]  Well, now in Mexico, they have new cults that are about killing kids and killing the women.
[28:29.400 --> 28:34.280]  It's always one up and see even Latin America now kills women and children.
[28:34.280 --> 28:40.320]  80% of the women coming across the border get raped by the coyotes.
[28:40.320 --> 28:41.640]  Decade ago, that wouldn't have happened.
[28:41.640 --> 28:48.440]  It's a plunge of evil worldwide as humanity loses its soul and as this satanic cult spreads
[28:48.440 --> 28:52.640]  its kentacles into every facet and every corner of the universe.
[28:52.640 --> 28:59.480]  When we come back, the real news of the enemy fears, I'm Alex Jones.
[28:59.480 --> 29:02.760]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs.

[29:06.200 --> 29:10.320]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.

[31:02.720 --> 31:05.160]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[31:05.160 --> 31:08.840]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot and doing your best to save
[31:08.840 --> 31:15.680]  America and encouraging us as fellow patriots to do that in our local areas as well.
[31:15.680 --> 31:20.960]  And as a longtime Infowars listener, I want to say thanks for the awesome BrainForce
[31:20.960 --> 31:21.960]  Anthroplex.
[31:21.960 --> 31:25.280]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[31:25.280 --> 31:29.400]  I use the Biotruce Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste for you folks who aren't big, normal
[31:29.400 --> 31:30.400]  toothpaste fans.
[31:30.400 --> 31:35.040]  The Super Blue is awesome, and thank you so much, Alex, for the InfowarsLife products
[31:35.040 --> 31:36.040]  they are quality.
[31:36.040 --> 31:40.440]  I can't wait to get some more, and thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us
[31:40.440 --> 31:41.440]  healthy.
[31:41.440 --> 31:42.440]  Absolutely.
[31:42.440 --> 31:48.080]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots, help our other countrymen and women understand
[31:48.080 --> 31:52.440]  that there's a bigger problems going on, and if we can get our houses in order and be
[31:52.440 --> 32:00.360]  good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[32:00.360 --> 32:06.680]  I'm so excited, the new product at InfowarsLife.com, in a glass bottle, two-month servings filled
[32:06.680 --> 32:11.480]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[32:11.480 --> 32:16.960]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[32:16.960 --> 32:19.920]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[32:19.920 --> 32:26.240]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients,
[32:26.240 --> 32:32.560]  and it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae,
[32:32.560 --> 32:36.240]  and I came up with our own formulae, working with some scientists and developers.
[32:36.240 --> 32:43.240]  Non-GMO, made right here in America, 120 capsules, and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone
[32:43.240 --> 32:48.680]  to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the
[32:48.680 --> 32:50.400]  hormones in your glands.
[32:50.400 --> 32:53.200]  It is amazing.
[32:53.200 --> 33:03.960]  Good pill, now available at InfowarsStore.com, and your purchase fugs the operation.
[33:03.960 --> 33:18.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and it's time for humanity to stand up in the

[33:25.960 --> 33:29.960]  to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[33:29.960 --> 33:47.840]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:47.840 --> 33:51.120]  This is why they fear us.
[33:51.120 --> 33:56.400]  Over 20 years ago, Alex Jones created the media platform called Infowars, and in the
[33:56.400 --> 34:02.880]  decade since, it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates,
[34:02.880 --> 34:08.800]  tens of millions of unique website visitors monthly, and a 24-7 live news TV channel broadcasting
[34:08.800 --> 34:11.840]  from state-of-the-art studios in Austin, Texas.
[34:11.840 --> 34:16.960]  Infowars has become the most trusted independent news source in the country, dedicated to delivering
[34:16.960 --> 34:22.560]  breaking news, live coverage of special events, and exclusive reports you won't find anywhere
[34:22.560 --> 34:23.560]  else.
[34:23.560 --> 34:28.640]  While the old-guard media struggles to maintain supremacy in a landscape brought by innovation
[34:28.640 --> 34:34.400]  and technology, Infowars has been at the forefront of the information revolution.
[34:34.400 --> 34:40.000]  From 8 million radio listeners, over 2 million YouTube subscribers, or the billions of views
[34:40.000 --> 34:45.680]  of our online content, Infowars proves dominant in every facet of media we enter.
[34:45.680 --> 34:51.760]  For the hardest-hitting reports, uncompromising analysis, for high-profile interviews and
[34:51.760 --> 35:01.200]  bombshell revelations, accept no substitutes, demand truth, demand Infowars.
[35:01.200 --> 35:07.600]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[35:07.600 --> 35:10.000]  I tell you, Harrison Smith is an amazing editor.
[35:10.000 --> 35:13.600]  Great job, Harrison, putting that together.
[35:13.600 --> 35:15.840]  And that's why they're after us, that's the truth.
[35:15.840 --> 35:22.120]  Because we give you deep analysis, historical information, and really expose what's at the
[35:22.120 --> 35:25.800]  heart of the situation.
[35:25.800 --> 35:33.400]  Now I want to get into Alik Manasian and what has come into focus.
[35:33.400 --> 35:37.080]  I said that I thought would be an Islamic attack, because 99% of these truck attacks
[35:37.080 --> 35:41.160]  there's been hundreds in the last few years around the world are Islamic.
[35:41.160 --> 35:43.480]  He has an Islamic-sounding last name.
[35:43.480 --> 35:45.760]  He's a foreigner.
[35:45.760 --> 35:48.440]  But he could have been a copycater, we're still on 100% sure.
[35:48.440 --> 35:52.560]  But I think I'm entering, usually I correct something about once a month, this will be
[35:52.560 --> 35:58.840]  two in one, one week, that it does not look like it's Islamic.
[35:58.840 --> 36:03.920]  But it's the very same background in the Middle East, the inbreeding that goes on, statistically
[36:03.920 --> 36:08.280]  you see higher crime rates, more homicide issues in the population.
[36:08.280 --> 36:13.280]  I talked about that earlier, but here's the big enchilada that the research team has uncovered,
[36:13.280 --> 36:26.760]  and it fits perfectly together and reminds me of this disgusting culture that is out
[36:26.760 --> 36:40.600]  there where these people call themselves involuntarily celibate, and they hate women because women
[36:40.600 --> 36:50.920]  don't like them, and so they say that they want to hurt them.
[36:50.920 --> 36:59.040]  Remember the young Turks guy just a decade ago in his postings online said, I hate women,
[36:59.040 --> 37:05.640]  they don't like me, they're a bunch of sluts, they're a bunch of dumb idiots.
[37:05.640 --> 37:11.200]  It's a perfectly Islamic statement even if he's a reprobate Muslim or whatever, think
[37:11.200 --> 37:18.960]  young Turk, Armenian genocide label, he is named after an Armenian genocide group, where
[37:18.960 --> 37:25.680]  he hates women, where he thinks they're stupid, he said their genetics are bad, isn't that
[37:25.680 --> 37:36.040]  funny, coming from the toad creature, but accused Toronto killer praised woman hating
[37:36.040 --> 37:41.680]  mass murder moments before attack, he expressed his support just moments before the attack
[37:41.680 --> 37:46.280]  for a mass murder who became a hero of the fringe men's right movement, all of the media
[37:46.280 --> 37:53.760]  calls it a fringe men's rights movement, what sullen little babies that didn't have a dad
[37:53.760 --> 37:59.280]  around and never got their ass kicked, I mean these men are scared of women, I can't figure
[37:59.280 --> 38:06.200]  it out, I just love love love women, I hang around women, I don't really hang around guys,
[38:06.200 --> 38:13.520]  I just like women period, the incel rebellion has already begun, hey how about you wimps
[38:13.520 --> 38:20.600]  if you got to, and I'm not for prostitution, but I mean do what you gotta do man up and
[38:20.600 --> 38:25.040]  go out and get a woman, let me tell you even if you're the weirdest nerd out there, if
[38:25.040 --> 38:29.480]  you just go to church, you're gonna find nice ladies that are looking for a man, and you
[38:29.480 --> 38:32.480]  know a lot of these guys aren't even bad looking but they're all into themselves, they're little
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.280]  video game, narcissist, you know all pale skin living in the basement, and then they
[38:37.280 --> 38:45.720]  just can't stand it that women don't like them, well they don't have any confidence,
[38:45.720 --> 38:51.400]  I mean it's a genetic thing, you're not supposed to breed bro, I guess you're just such a
[38:51.400 --> 38:55.480]  wimp, but I'm sorry I'm just digressing, I didn't even know about the incel movement
[38:55.480 --> 38:58.800]  until I saw this a few years ago that I'd forgotten about it and Zach was pointing
[38:58.800 --> 39:05.920]  it out to me, what a disgusting group of people, guys man up man, go out, and by the way you
[39:05.920 --> 39:11.320]  don't have to get a super model, they're usually super boring, and super only obsessed with
[39:11.320 --> 39:16.600]  themselves, God just get you a girl who wants to have a good time, take her out to movies
[39:16.600 --> 39:22.480]  or something, jeez, the incel rebellion has already begun, we will overthrow all Chad's
[39:22.480 --> 39:28.920]  and Stacy's, all hell the supreme gentleman, Elliot Roger, so it's the worship of this
[39:28.920 --> 39:37.280]  conceited, I'm not gonna call him effeminate, but this metrosexual, put Elliot Roger back
[39:37.280 --> 39:43.760]  on screen, I forgot how disgusting that guy is, just make sure skin crawl, how he's totally
[39:43.760 --> 39:49.480]  boring, totally stupid, totally into himself, totally pissed off, that he has this big image
[39:49.480 --> 39:54.280]  of himself and he can't project any of it in the real world, if you weren't such a
[39:54.280 --> 39:59.960]  conceited, creepy person who purses his lips every time he talks, he just loves everything
[39:59.960 --> 40:03.840]  he says, he just loves everything he does, I mean I look at somebody like that and I
[40:03.840 --> 40:09.320]  don't want to break his nose, I'll just be honest with you, you look at the globalists,
[40:09.320 --> 40:14.800]  they all act exactly like that, bunch of scum, Elliot Roger killed six people during 2014
[40:14.800 --> 40:21.000]  shooting spree in Isla Vista, California after planning his anti-woman revenge rampage for
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.320]  more than a year, the 22 year old called himself an incel or involuntarily celibate, a phrase
[40:27.320 --> 40:34.320]  invoked by men's rights activists who feel rejected by women, Roger killed himself at
[40:34.320 --> 40:40.880]  the conclusion of the attack, leaving behind 137 page manifesto that described how he felt
[40:40.880 --> 40:46.880]  shunned by women and sought revenge, he also reportedly showed an interest in Nazis and
[40:46.880 --> 40:57.360]  had conducted internet searches about how to silently kill with a knife and now this new
[40:57.360 --> 41:07.680]  individual reportedly says he likes him and he picked out people to run over, but see
[41:07.680 --> 41:13.040]  how that ties into Islam, Islam is a woman hating religion where the women have to wear
[41:13.040 --> 41:19.880]  beekeeper suits and where women can't drive cars or have normal jobs and where their husbands
[41:19.880 --> 41:24.120]  can kill them, pour gasoline on them, drown them in the pool or pour acid on their faces
[41:24.120 --> 41:31.160]  and routinely it's in the news all the time kill their daughters because they didn't have
[41:31.160 --> 41:35.440]  their veil on a man saw their face and that's what the feminist movement thinks so great,
[41:35.440 --> 41:39.480]  but the feminist movement run by the globalist to control women is another side of oppressing
[41:39.480 --> 41:46.200]  women and controlling them because women in culture and in advertising are the prize
[41:46.200 --> 41:54.040]  that as Hitler said first you get the women then you got the children so follow the men
[41:54.040 --> 41:59.520]  and so you've got this incredible obsession and oppression that's going on and the left
[41:59.520 --> 42:05.440]  is women go oh look this is a right wing movement of men, no it's a movement of scumbags, if
[42:05.440 --> 42:11.080]  you look at psychopaths they almost always are the same way don't have any friends, lived
[42:11.080 --> 42:16.040]  alone at home, didn't have a daddy around most of the time and never got pushed out
[42:16.040 --> 42:21.200]  of the nest and then never developed and then feel so insecure they project it on to people
[42:21.200 --> 42:27.680]  outside so they start killing and torturing animals not for food but just to kill them
[42:27.680 --> 42:36.200]  and then they start killing women because that's how they finally capture them, it's
[42:36.200 --> 42:42.920]  how they think they dominate them, it's how they plant their flag on them instead of just
[42:42.920 --> 42:49.760]  growing with women into the future as a species because that's what women are looking for
[42:49.760 --> 42:53.640]  even if they've been brainwashed and don't know what they're looking for, everything
[42:53.640 --> 42:59.760]  is like verdant fields, we'll be back.

[47:32.960 --> 47:36.840]  I want to put a book in on what I was just talking about with not the accused killer
[47:36.840 --> 47:42.580]  he's the guy that consciously ran over 30-something people killing 10 mainly women as he drove
[47:42.580 --> 47:48.080]  down the street looking for a group of women to kill and how the media, the leftist media
[47:48.080 --> 47:55.120]  is now spending on how it's a right wing anti-woman movement and look I get it women can be cruel
[47:55.120 --> 48:01.560]  especially in this culture, women more and more are into themselves that's how the culture
[48:01.560 --> 48:05.640]  has been engineered because the family has been somewhat obliterated and women have been
[48:05.640 --> 48:10.720]  taught that traditional family structures aren't going to empower them so they kind
[48:10.720 --> 48:17.560]  of marry themselves the state it's a complex issue and I was a very competent, confident
[48:17.560 --> 48:24.800]  person and I was still insecure sometimes and you know felt like I was a loser even
[48:24.800 --> 48:30.000]  though I was very popular and successful so I think some of that insecurity when you're
[48:30.000 --> 48:35.200]  young is designed we know through sociology, anthropology, psychology to get you out of
[48:35.200 --> 48:38.960]  the nest to go out and accomplish things you're not supposed to feel like you've conquered
[48:38.960 --> 48:44.120]  the world when you're 15 years old and some people get girlfriends and wives and sometimes
[48:44.120 --> 48:50.320]  you get a wife and you know she takes everything you got my personal case and then you never
[48:50.320 --> 48:58.480]  date women again I have like a great uncle who's still alive who owned stuff up in Georgetown
[48:58.480 --> 49:03.640]  he listens I'm actually going to tell a story but he got married later in life to a really
[49:03.640 --> 49:08.480]  hot chick and then she took what he had like you know six months and then he never dated
[49:08.480 --> 49:13.560]  again so I mean I'm not knocking guys that are celibate or you know guys that become
[49:13.560 --> 49:17.760]  bachelors just because of all the issues in society and culture I'm not judging people
[49:17.760 --> 49:25.400]  that don't have children all I'm saying is if you know how women work and are just straight
[49:25.400 --> 49:32.720]  up and point things out and don't get into the fake narratives and argue with women I
[49:32.720 --> 49:37.320]  found women are way more easy to wake up to what's going on than men men are either kind
[49:37.320 --> 49:43.360]  of awake already or they're hard to wake up women generally want to be socially constructive
[49:43.360 --> 49:46.840]  they get fooled into going with the globalist because they're taught that's all socially
[49:46.840 --> 49:51.520]  constructive when you show them how it's designed to not be that's can show them the proof they're
[49:51.520 --> 49:56.680]  the easiest group to wake up it's like women are easier to teach to how to shoot a gun
[49:56.680 --> 50:02.160]  and are just as good a shot as men are better that they're now arguing because women are
[50:02.160 --> 50:08.360]  more teachable and not because they're really followers they're looking in their basic programming
[50:08.360 --> 50:14.320]  to get along in the village to be nice and then when there's trouble men are biologically
[50:14.320 --> 50:18.800]  designed to have to deal with that and that's the dirty job it's not the cool job that's
[50:18.800 --> 50:26.360]  why men are expendable because men don't even have the second set of DNA everyone is a girl
[50:26.360 --> 50:32.440]  in in in in their embryonic levels and the globalists all know this it's why everything
[50:32.440 --> 50:36.480]  they do is targeting women to just like they want to run the environmental movement and
[50:36.480 --> 50:40.240]  make it all about carbon dioxide instead of genetic engineering and all the nightmares
[50:40.240 --> 50:46.680]  and the clones and the toxic waste dumping and the and the high altitude aerosol weather
[50:46.680 --> 50:52.600]  modification and the fission fusion and the artificial black holes and the superconducting
[50:52.600 --> 51:07.560]  supercollider cyclotrons all of this 5g will give you massive brain tumors will give you
[51:07.560 --> 51:12.360]  heart attacks it's in all the studies you know the heart is an incredible muscle and
[51:12.360 --> 51:21.400]  it's got a bunch of nerves in it that are hooked to the brain and they've known this
[51:21.400 --> 51:25.640]  for decades but now it's been confirmed with the high tech science they've got why do you
[51:25.640 --> 51:31.240]  I'm sure you've heard the stories about somebody gets a heart transplant and people say man
[51:31.240 --> 51:34.600]  he's healthy he's happy she's healthy she's happy but they don't have any heart anymore
[51:34.600 --> 51:39.920]  it's like they don't care about life well the ancients all knew it's the heart you've
[51:39.920 --> 51:46.880]  got brain tissue in your spine and your heart and when you lose your heart it's been there
[51:46.880 --> 51:52.600]  from the time you were conceived since the time you you developed into an embryo your
[51:52.600 --> 51:58.760]  brain thinks you're dead that's why I know in some secret research I was told about it's
[51:58.760 --> 52:02.920]  not classified but it's highly proprietary they're talking about when they remove people's
[52:02.920 --> 52:08.360]  hearts now they're gonna try to graft the nerve ganglia that fires the heart from your
[52:08.360 --> 52:13.680]  heart onto it show that people don't have the depression and all the other issues because
[52:13.680 --> 52:20.840]  you imagine your brain when your heart's gone it's still beating a new heart but it's not
[52:20.840 --> 52:26.480]  it's not connecting all the emotions of the brain and your gut has even more brain cell
[52:26.480 --> 52:31.720]  type areas connected to the brain than your heart does that's why people say go with your
[52:31.720 --> 52:35.920]  gut because your subconscious will tell you in your gut where your stomach is where the
[52:35.920 --> 52:40.000]  food is where you really care like hey man I'm tingling this isn't good and then back
[52:40.000 --> 52:47.760]  to your neck stands up the hair stands up like I'm about to get to fight because your
[52:47.760 --> 52:51.680]  brain subconscious is hundreds and hundreds of times were powerful and it's telling your
[52:51.680 --> 52:58.480]  gut and it's telling your heart will you cut the heart out your brain your subconscious
[52:58.480 --> 53:07.680]  says where are you where are you it's like a lobotomy where are you so that's what we're
[53:07.680 --> 53:15.200]  dealing with here ladies and gentlemen and so we're under attack as a species and so
[53:15.200 --> 53:21.560]  that's why I don't want to fight with the families of Sandy Hook that's why I don't
[53:21.560 --> 53:25.880]  want to fight with the even the globalist this is all insane where we're going you know
[53:25.880 --> 53:29.000]  you notice the one and guardian came out and said oh my gosh YouTube took down an anti
[53:29.000 --> 53:34.120]  Alex Jones video about Sandy Hook because it's heavily edited out of context when I
[53:34.120 --> 53:38.040]  played devil's advocate and years ago went back and forth because there were so many
[53:38.040 --> 53:42.240]  anomalies but for years I've said I believe that happened they'll never let me say that
[53:42.240 --> 53:46.440]  the news just keeps saying Jones keeps saying no one died and is being mean to the families
[53:46.440 --> 53:50.920]  and the families going TV and say it even though we've been contacting him and and they know
[53:50.920 --> 53:56.000]  the media recycles it over and over and over again to bring Sandy Hook back up and would
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.800]  attack the free press but there's a perfect example YouTube took the video down because
[54:00.800 --> 54:05.000]  you guys have been purging anybody questioning mass shootings or events to set the precedent
[54:05.000 --> 54:09.200]  to get rid of free speech I'm talking about George Soros and George Soros's media matters
[54:09.200 --> 54:16.920]  had their highly edited video taken down and then they went oh you're censoring us well
[54:16.920 --> 54:23.120]  wait you want my videos taken down where I'm actually shame when I really believe but then
[54:23.120 --> 54:30.400]  you want to put up edited ones and then say that I'm bringing everything back up no you
[54:30.400 --> 54:34.560]  said you want all that taken down yours got taken down show them the Guardian article
[54:34.560 --> 54:42.400]  please here's the Guardian article YouTube under fire for censoring video exposing conspiracy
[54:42.400 --> 54:47.840]  theorist Alex Jones so see they want to bring up old edited videos out of context just like
[54:47.840 --> 54:52.320]  Megan Kelly's done and then they want to sit there when they reboot it and say oh Jones
[54:52.320 --> 55:00.240]  won't shut up and stop saying it lying to their audiences it is incredible so this is
[55:00.240 --> 55:07.120]  all this is all a diversion we're being killed by 5g 4g the globalists are genetically manipulating
[55:07.120 --> 55:13.520]  our DNA and we're mutating in bad ways the species is under attack we've got real issues
[55:13.520 --> 55:21.360]  to deal with here the same mainstream media that says it cares about children so much
[55:21.360 --> 55:26.680]  and always blames gun owners collectively for any children that die being shot our hearts
[55:26.680 --> 55:32.640]  go out to Mr. Haslund all these folks get to understand governments have killed millions
[55:32.640 --> 55:35.800]  and millions of people hundreds of millions people there's never a memorial about that
[55:35.800 --> 55:41.520]  there's never a newscast about that there's never any coverage of that or how our media
[55:41.520 --> 55:45.760]  lied to get us into these wars that killed millions of innocent people no it's all Alex
[55:45.760 --> 55:52.080]  Jones is bad Donald Trump's a Nazi blah blah blah it's not true and then they bring it back
[55:52.080 --> 55:57.280]  up and say I'm bringing it back up and say apologize don't bring it up anymore and I
[55:57.280 --> 56:01.720]  say I'm sorry if things were taken out of context and hurt your feelings and you know
[56:01.720 --> 56:07.160]  let's just move on but then it's he won't shut up he won't apologize he won't move on
[56:07.160 --> 56:12.360]  it's all on record to our audience so again it's just the recycle beating me up all day
[56:12.360 --> 56:18.720]  and it doesn't really hurt info wars if you continue to support us we will make it through
[56:18.720 --> 56:22.760]  all of us you know you didn't hear anything about how they had to withdraw in fact my
[56:22.760 --> 56:29.000]  lawyer senate and I didn't get it out of my email I need to print they withdrew the lawsuit
[56:29.000 --> 56:34.720]  in Charlottesville yesterday which again got no coverage in the media and of course they're
[56:34.720 --> 56:39.200]  gonna reintroduce it but it was so badly filed it had so many things that weren't true that
[56:39.200 --> 56:43.480]  it would be immediately thrown out you know the 70 pages of things I didn't say and things
[56:43.480 --> 56:48.720]  I didn't do you don't put that in lawsuits it's like a fake screenplay and Alex Jones
[56:48.720 --> 56:55.760]  says that the cameraman killed a woman I didn't say that that's defamatory to me so we filed
[56:55.760 --> 57:01.080]  this countersuit on them and they pulled that one back because our suits pursuant to their
[57:01.080 --> 57:05.800]  suit it sues their suit and at the end that they're slapback provisions people ask how
[57:05.800 --> 57:11.920]  that works so they're like oh wait we were we are bacon's burned let's put this in and
[57:11.920 --> 57:17.800]  we're sure whatever they file be just as bad because it's not true and so you can have
[57:17.800 --> 57:23.880]  your victory in the media all day long but I didn't say that camera guy killed that woman
[57:23.880 --> 57:30.320]  that's defamatory to say I said that you will lose in any court and by the way their last
[57:30.320 --> 57:34.560]  fake lawsuit it's going to be admissible if it ever went to trial but they don't want
[57:34.560 --> 57:37.680]  that they just want to drag me to the mud with all these fake lawsuits to make it look
[57:37.680 --> 57:43.360]  like I'm losing no info wars is winning and our audience is winning we are the madrix
[57:43.360 --> 57:46.760]  we are the trailblazers and that's why the globalists are panicking hour number two straight
[57:46.760 --> 57:55.960]  it's been sold out for months and now it's back it's my cozx plus lower price more ingredients
[57:55.960 --> 58:01.600]  because we scaled up signed to your contract with even bigger organic manufacturer and
[58:01.600 --> 58:08.760]  producer scalability but now we're able to go at 30% off to $27 instead of $39 50% off
[58:08.760 --> 58:13.360]  because there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient my cozx now it's the other side
[58:13.360 --> 58:17.320]  of the equation everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because
[58:17.320 --> 58:21.800]  of toxins in the environment pesticides herbicides but more importantly than bad bacteria the
[58:21.800 --> 58:28.520]  probiotics help displace yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the
[58:28.520 --> 58:32.880]  yeast and the mold and all that get in there it causes all sorts of psoriasis well this
[58:32.880 --> 58:38.240]  has got a bunch of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime
[58:38.240 --> 58:42.400]  wall don't wait to start detoxifying your body until it's too late pick up a bottle

[59:46.360 --> 01:00:15.280]  part of the second american revolution you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:27.120]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcm radio network
[01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:40.400]  saddle up roll out the battle for the future is here i've got the most powerful news of
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:45.560]  the day that analysis you're not going to get anywhere else not to keep pointing that
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:54.440]  out because we've got their number coming up the next segment the great exodus out of
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:01:08.040]  america's blue cities is accelerating and we are going to break all of this down when
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:18.960]  we come back and then a very interesting article out of the associated press about
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:32.400]  how the cia the nsa defense intelligence the fbi are all meeting with the cast and crew
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:45.880]  writers and directors of the show homeland to help them attack yours truly better remember
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:51.160]  the president supposedly runs these agencies but they're all actively against him at those
[01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:57.360]  levels at those divisions the people actually fighting and doing humance and all the real
[01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:02.640]  stuff are almost all listeners patriots i'm not exaggerating that's why they hate the
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:15.080]  show but the brain bugs the academics the rulers the ivy league they all want to be
[01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:19.080]  big movie stars and so they all sit there and they even give billions of dollars a year
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:27.360]  to hollywood to foment this crap like jordan klepper's program and homeland which they
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.560]  say is based around alex jones but then it's not based around alex jones and again why
[01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.720]  are there more than 10 shows about me that aren't what i'll actually say why are there's
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.640]  hundreds of articles a day just it's like it's now reached stratospheric insane asylum
[01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:51.960]  portions i'm a white supremacist in the show that stages terror attacks and has thousands
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:03:03.000]  of employees that run fake news and i want to kill the president
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:07.320]  and it's even admitted you know how the cia hoodwinked hollywood they didn't hoodwink them
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:20.520]  hollywood is the cia the cia is just a holding company the cia is just a big nest of military
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:28.560]  industrial complex money making and so i've got that article i want to get into it and
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:34.880]  again it's not about talking about ourselves we have to do this because they are stealing
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:41.240]  our identity misrepresenting who we are committing cultural crimes in the eye of the people and
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:46.160]  then they suspend disbelief and then they believe when they walk up to me on the street
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:50.400]  and pour coffee on my head or tell me i'm a nazi or tell my love i never played that

[01:06:57.120 --> 01:07:04.080]  senator elizabeth warren sues after city tells him to stop calling her a fake indian that's
[01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:09.400]  the politically correct folks oh that hurts a us senator's fault the native american groups
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:15.240]  said there's no registry of her there's no background of her having any native american
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:23.280]  background and that it's a fraud but oh she's a public figure but she's a woman so you can't
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:34.280]  talk bad about her he's gonna be joining us now let's get into the issue of issues that
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:38.120]  if you tie this together with globalism you tie it together with the larger strategic
[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:45.480]  plans if you understand what's going on you understand it all the globalist are multinational
[01:07:45.480 --> 01:07:49.760]  corporations that have set up a planetary system of corporate governance that was very
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:55.040]  near completion until the populist counter strikes of the last few years that you have
[01:07:55.040 --> 01:07:59.880]  seen take place all over the world that myself and many others have diligently worked for
[01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:07.520]  in the 1776 worldwide plan my plan but was actually an amalgamation of other americana
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:15.240]  reboot plans but the 1776 worldwide plan has been adopted informally by patriots and intelligence
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:18.160]  agencies around the world i will just go ahead and tell you why the globalists hate us so
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:22.960]  much because they know that we are putting out the plans that get adopted because they
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:26.440]  just make pure america sense coming right out of texas of course not bragging is the
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:33.520]  fact you have to know why they hate us so much so they exploit the third world they build
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:37.560]  no real infrastructure they block the third world getting infrastructure which actually
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:43.440]  make the third world only have two children on average which if you believe in overpopulation
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:48.680]  which has happened in some areas it handles it and the royal commission on population
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:56.440]  got into this in 49 but they decided to go with the plan of overpopulation exploiting
[01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:02.800]  the overpopulation to deindustrialize the west and then to use those third world populations
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:11.240]  later as a reverse colonization battering ram to smash the middle class bring it down
[01:09:11.240 --> 01:09:17.120]  and then only have a super elite and a giant slave class under it you wonder why asia
[01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:21.880]  and latin america and africa don't have an upper don't have a middle class because it's
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:29.680]  a system designed called feudalism where the people are serfs and it's been adopted as
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:38.080]  a neo feudalistic planetary technocracy a breakaway high tech civilization above tax
[01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:50.400]  exempt diplomatic immunity above the law corporate reservations offshore systems they then bring
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:57.840]  in policies that are phased in where they first bring in systems to get you dependent
[01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:04.120]  on the government they then put in their people into into the academia into banking into government
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:11.440]  into media they then move in with a socialist programming template to get the next generation
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:17.640]  even more dependent and then by the third generation of this you see what's happened
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:26.600]  in cuba venezuela north korea everywhere it turns into an abject depopulation nightmare
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:31.800]  because by design they get rid of the infrastructure they take it over they seed it to the party
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:38.720]  officials to become fabulously wealthy they all move to luxenburg or to new york city
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:46.320]  or to switzerland or to tazmania or to kawaii or to new zealand you go to new zealand you
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:51.200]  go to kawaii there's rich latin americans with helicopter pads and you know living in
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:59.840]  10 000 square foot guest houses or 10 000 square foot 30 40 000 square foot houses private
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:04.840]  jets line the fields there's rich chinese there's rich latin americans there's rich
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:14.120]  africans there's rich eastern europeans there's rich americans and they're the ruling class
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:21.680]  and they come in with chicken feed socialism just enough to make you survive then they
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:27.440]  start cutting the resources off in the middle phase and say oh the right wingers the nationalists
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.560]  they're trying to take your free money they're trying to take what you're surviving on you
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:39.000]  fight and put in a government that then promises even more socialism even more communism even
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:44.720]  more redistribution and then the middle class that owns factories and farms and businesses
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:54.080]  and pharmacies and farms and all these things they get taken over and they still let the
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:59.440]  people that own them be the managers and they get a small part of the profit in the next
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:04.880]  phase they get rid of them completely things completely implode there's war on the streets
[01:12:04.880 --> 01:12:09.160]  children you know eating out of trash cans all the dogs and cats get eaten the animals
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:17.640]  of the zoo get eaten by my best way look you have a complete collapse and then there's
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:24.040]  a revolution financed by the jackals by the imf by the world bank by the cia this is all
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:31.560]  on record it's been declassified they come in overthrow the communists but leave the
[01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:35.960]  communists infrastructure in the schools and the political correct culture in they leave
[01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:44.440]  all the communists in but the top three layers then they put corporate functionaries in over
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:50.200]  the communist managers the people that sold the country out are long gone living in five
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:55.680]  hundred million dollar palaces in switzerland literally like manwell noriega had before
[01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.320]  he turned on them but the news doesn't show that unless you turn on them then you get
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:05.440]  to see noriega's hundred million dollar palaces then you know then you know then he gets taken
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:11.720]  over militarily so i've kind of set some of the background here before i get to this so
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.600]  after they get everything looted everything that was in private hands into government
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:22.880]  hands that's brought down then the corporate fascists come in just like obama told two
[01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.240]  years ago before he left office he was down in latin america on a tour and he told the
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:31.880]  chileans uh he told the brazilians he told them all he said he played the clip many times
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:36.680]  he said listen communism and capitalism are good china's communist then it works with
[01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:41.320]  the capitalist and he's explaining to their phd students you're gonna manage that and
[01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:47.760]  make a lot of money your people will be slaves you'll put communism on them but the money
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:54.480]  will go to you offshore and the two things work together they're both good because it's
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:02.320]  called slavery so china does and so that's the face they put malin in 49 in the next
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:09.440]  30 years he kills 80 plus million of his own people forces everybody off the land into
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:15.960]  compact cities builds all these globalist finance factories kills all the christians kills
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:23.200]  all the buddhist mortar attacks the dolly llamas you know house you know the story it's all
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:30.360]  on record and then after all that oh mal dies they arrest his wife they blame the communism
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:33.480]  they said they're gonna reform and then the corporate fascism comes in they still call
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:39.600]  a communist you're getting the exact globalist program this is how they do and it's not my
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.480]  opinion carol quickly wrote tragedy and hope describing how it works that's that's how i
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:48.120]  understand it i didn't just figure it out my own little selfie here that of georgetown
[01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.440]  political science did you know the same ones had to withdraw their suit on me yesterday
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.920]  but their every file don't worry but so bad i could absolutely win and slap back on them
[01:14:56.920 --> 01:15:00.760]  so they they think the new ones gonna be good oh that's a fraud too i'm sure so don't worry
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:10.400]  now continuing ladies and gentlemen it's critical to back up from this when we come back and
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.680]  i will then lay out how they're going to do that here in the united states but see they
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:19.280]  don't stop there now they've hit the technotronic technocracy level once the corporate fascists
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:23.880]  come in take over the country claim now it's kind of socialist capitalist they turn on
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:28.000]  some of the food turn on the water again after years not having food and water people kind
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:34.440]  of accept the new fascist regime that still has communist rulers over it at the mid level
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.760]  communist miners cuba is about to go into the corporate control it's gone through its
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:46.240]  processing and training some places take longer than others then what happens next and then
[01:15:46.240 --> 01:15:50.720]  we'll look at the u.s. and how they're planning in here it's gonna be a little bit more funnest
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:57.840]  but once they get it in place they are going to torture you and your family to death fellow

[01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:50.480]  and the world if you knew what the big planetary powers what the big mega corporations were
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:55.640]  planning well they think we're done animals so they've all written books and thousands
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:59.880]  of white papers about what their plans have been and they've been pretty much following
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:05.600]  them and Elon musk is warned they're bringing the world government they worship AI gods
[01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:10.640]  and they plan on reducing the world population by 90% now we're about to enter the final
[01:21:10.640 --> 01:21:15.560]  phase there's been decisions at the highest levels to try to fight this because it's so
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:21.240]  psychotic so everybody might want to listen because this is very important the key to
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:27.920]  understanding it a rosetta stone a keyhole through which we can look is the great exodus
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:35.480]  out of america's blue cities and blue states and how this is going to end now in the last
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:42.840]  segments I broke down to be just joined us how big mega corporations fund communist getting
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:49.000]  into power in china in russia in venezuela in cuba they always put on acts like they're
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:52.440]  against it but it's all been declassified that our government put moussey tongue and
[01:21:52.440 --> 01:22:00.480]  in 49 on and on but without getting into the minutiae of history it's a program where they
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:04.800]  get you socialist then they get you dependent then they threaten to withdraw it you then
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:11.560]  call for total socialism a la bernie sanders you get it for a while within five to ten
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:16.720]  years things totally collapse but during that process the state is consolidating all the
[01:22:16.720 --> 01:22:21.880]  businesses all the farms all the factories then when that finally goes belly up corporate
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:28.760]  fascists come in with the imf and world bank quote bail you out terms and conditions where
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:34.480]  they put their people in charge of your country they leave the communist in charge of administration
[01:22:34.480 --> 01:22:39.600]  but they don't call it communist and the corporate fascists are on top getting 100% pure money
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:49.000]  with no taxes paid in fact you pay them interest on the money you pay them now pull back from
[01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:56.920]  that pull back from that far then pull back again and then ask what's the end game they
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:23:01.960]  get total control socially over you they don't let you have any middle class system so you're
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:06.840]  independent you're a slave you're controlled you you owe your soul to the company store
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:13.680]  that's why they want a basic income trial it's to build in dependency you know they
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:17.680]  got signs saying don't feed the animals at the park why because they become obese lazy
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:25.760]  and stupid prosperity makes monsters adversity makes men so here's the article out of the
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:31.560]  hill I got another one here out of AP similar headline the great exodus out of america's
[01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:39.000]  blue cities and it's so big it's been going on for decades the brain drain workers middle
[01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:45.080]  class scientists engineers farmers all fleeing leftist controlled areas they don't care they
[01:23:45.080 --> 01:23:50.200]  build giant high rise apartments 250 square foot rip off the third world populations that
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:54.760]  come in for a third world populations work 10 hours a day but then also have to get welfare
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:59.040]  just to live now they're under government control then they can be brainwashed and they
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:05.840]  can be turned into political weapons and that's the next phase we're a phase behind here in
[01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:10.120]  the u.s. we're going into the socialism phase the total domestication phase we're at the
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:16.000]  public's on the dole but you've already seen it what's done in other countries and then
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:23.320]  the fascist model come in after and so once they've got that socialist control once they've
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:27.400]  got us domesticated then they start exploiting you look at all the kingpins that push this
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:38.680]  bezos bezos gates warren buffet every single one of these guys promote socialism collectivism
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:45.040]  forced inoculation public school control gates calls it private corporate but it's just a
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:53.720]  new form of public corporate school and then they can dictate how many kids you can have
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.400]  then they can dictate how big of a house you can have germany's already passed laws years
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:04.680]  ago no new single family dwellings canada says don't use the word mother or father it's
[01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:07.960]  hurtful all this stuff we talked about a decade ago people didn't believe they thought oh
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.800]  that's some crazy professor no what they teach in the colleges universally globally is what
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:20.800]  the corporations want and it's what they're deploying and to a man and to a company from
[01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:27.360]  bezos and all the things he owns the hundreds of big companies from Alexa to Whole Foods
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:39.440]  to Zappos to Twitch to IMDB to Workday to Grail and Domo and Juno and Twitter and everything
[01:25:39.440 --> 01:25:49.520]  else he pays no taxes he's international but they'll lecture you all day if you make
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.840]  $100,000, $200,000, $300,000 a year and you actually live in this country and you pay taxes
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:59.120]  at 40% local even more you have almost none of your money you're the bad guy but this
[01:25:59.120 --> 01:26:04.080]  guy he's good because he funds Black Lives Matter now he's got all these Chinese slave
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:08.400]  factories just like Apple the very worst in the world but it's okay because he acts
[01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:15.720]  metrosexual now with him it's not a metrosexual thing he's a ravenous vicious control free
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:21.760]  just a horrible biggest web shop owner in the country probably in the world but they put
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:27.320]  on the act that they're wimps and that it's cool for other men to be wimps because that's
[01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:32.640]  who they want under them they don't want any chance at men standing up and leading us out
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:40.640]  of this and it's psychological warfare par excellence and that ladies and gentlemen's
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:44.120]  the rest of the story then they bring in the total world government then they bring in
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.680]  the carbon controls and the carbon calorie intake tracker systems all have a little

[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:25.840]  it all rolls out because I'm saying it's a bad idea and explaining why and saying transhumanism
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:29.400]  and transgenderism isn't about a man that wants to be a woman that's always gone on
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:35.080]  or vice versa or men that have feminine tendencies and females that have the whatever I don't
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:40.120]  need any it's that you're being used as the test case so that you can't criticize anything
[01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.160]  that's trans because they're going to put real replicants on the street and you know

[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:13.280]  good evening everybody
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:25.280]  she is an abject psychopathic demon from hell people around her saying she's so dark now and so evil and so possessed that they are having nightmares they're freaking out
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:37.280]  they say listen obama and hillary both smell like sulfur
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:45.280]  there's too much coke and too much smoke look what's going on inside you
[01:33:45.280 --> 01:34:01.280]  it's different at this point does this make you smell that smell
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:17.280]  there's a guy on the radio he said he and hillary are demons said we smell like sulfur
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:33.280]  we smell like sulfur
[01:34:33.280 --> 01:34:49.280]  we smell like sulfur
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:35:05.280]  we smell like sulfur
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:21.280]  the center is going to do something about these flies
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:37.280]  I knew they'd take the bait when I called Obama and Hillary literal demons they reportedly do really smell bad a lot of the time but that's just part of psychos not caring how they smelled other people in some selfish they don't tend to themselves
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:59.280]  but Hillary's always stunk really bad that's a beatnik thing she's into but they are spiritually demons they're very bad people obama expanded more wars than the last three presidents combined back to arab spring all those incredible crimes to destroy any sovereign stable countries
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:19.280]  the globalists don't want anybody to have anything stable and that's what where they want america to go they want to deindustrialize this country as well and in closing to what I was covering the last segment why can't democrats why can't the minions of this understand
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:35.280]  that Zabigny Brzezinski wrote three books on the subject I read all three the Carol Quigley wrote two books on the subject tragedy and hope and the Anglo-american establishment I read both books
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:51.280]  I'd read a bunch of those about time I was 16 years old I didn't read tragedy and hope till later just couldn't get through it just really academic but I mean I got what was there but it was just a headache but basically the CIA in the 60s
[01:36:51.280 --> 01:37:06.280]  and the state department running it said we don't understand what's going on we're fighting communists and we're fighting fascists and we're fighting dictators but we actually want them in but we tell the public we don't
[01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:22.280]  and he said listen you want to control both parties in every country or all the parties in a parliamentary system and you want it to look like there's fights on the service but behind the scenes grow the government get rid of the middle class transfer money offshore
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:44.280]  domesticate the population make them poor make them dependent and he says this in the book the books online for free we sell it in hardcover 1000 were printed 1000 and then when copies got out
[01:37:44.280 --> 01:37:56.280]  they destroyed the plates but then it got reverse engineered and because government funding went into writing the book it's open source but there's only one group publishes it down
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:09.280]  that's the thing when I get some globalist professor some trendy talk show host yelling at me and saying oh Jones has his opinion Jones is this and that oh human clones oh gay frogs oh oh world government oh oh
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:27.280]  world governments all over the news and that's why they're out to get us because we already you as a listeners as the activist you already forced all this out in the open so our credibility is very very high so they pick a few issues where
[01:38:27.280 --> 01:38:43.280]  they can twist what we said or where we were wrong we're not perfect and they turn it into this big giant celebration of how bad I am so that psychologically now they can take our victory and make me a symbol of failure
[01:38:43.280 --> 01:38:57.280]  a symbol of fake news and then go George Soros is a Nazi Alex Jones says so or there's no world government Alex Jones says so there's no chemicals in the water hurting wildlife Alex Jones says so even though it's all admitted because we exposed it
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:10.280]  they've got this alchemy where they take me and they make me the image of fake news to try to sell it but it's not working so that's why info wars is a battle now
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:23.280]  I had naively years ago thought that we could trigger 1776 worldwide point out the globalist authoritarian system point out its master plan point out how they have the process of domesticating is making a sport for political and cultural control
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:37.280]  towards the eugenics the population and they've got to get full control of us first we're talking domestication enslavement by the very definition by a scientific technological elite
[01:39:37.280 --> 01:39:50.280]  and I mean how many national security advisors how many heads of universities write books about this and they think you're so stupid they do it in public because they thought nobody would organize to fight them
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:40:06.280]  they thought nobody would criticize them they thought nobody would develop a plan to fight them well I didn't build the plan I just rebooted the plan you rebooted the plan we built an audience we got Congress we got the military
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:16.280]  listening we got foreign governments listening and they already know what I'm saying is true and then we're just how about we have renaissance how about we have a marijuana and free market globally
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:30.280]  and go to the stars that'll actually work great instead of a big global collapse with a breakaway elite and everybody else starving to death and then exterminated really a eugenics plan that predates Hitler
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:43.280]  Hitler was just an offshoot a bad son as they call them you know a bad son's like a little tree that grows up by its parent tree but it's not one in your yard you don't want to let it grow there
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:48.280]  you might dig one up and transplant it somewhere but usually you just come over with a weed eater and cut them down
[01:40:48.280 --> 01:41:04.280]  Hitler was a bad son but he was used very well to shift the power in the globe break things up and then allow a massive manifestation of force here in the name of fighting that while the average American believe they were
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:13.280]  while the deep state behind the scenes was putting China in power propping up the Soviet Union putting socialist revolutions in Latin America
[01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:25.280]  but if they didn't follow orders then sending in the whole paradigm is full spectrum dominance but not the full spectrum dominance that you read about land seeing air cyberspace
[01:41:25.280 --> 01:41:52.280]  land see air cyberspace space the mind all major political movements the major religious systems the family the biology of humans under AI sentient programming and control
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:42:11.280]  and in the darkness behind them so everybody else read these books and decided to join this thing I didn't Ron Paul didn't Nigel Farage didn't Victor Orban didn't
[01:42:11.280 --> 01:42:31.280]  Klaus didn't a lot of other people didn't vitamin Putin clearly didn't the Muslims are under their Islamic control over their their masters and they are with it
[01:42:31.280 --> 01:42:49.280]  so it is the big tech companies Hollywood the globalist the Democratic Party a lot of the Republicans the radical Islamists the Communist Chinese backing it all up the EU globalists the pedophiles the Satanist against what's left of America Japan South Korea
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:56.280]  Christians all over the world and the spirit of Americana
[01:42:56.280 --> 01:43:11.280]  they use their media to assassinate real news they use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler they use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:28.280]  and then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia to smash windows burn cars shut down interstates and airports bully and terrorize the law
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:50.280]  abiding until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness and when that happens they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage the only way we stop this the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with the clenched fist of truth
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:59.280]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm freedom's safest place.

[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:50.280]  now I'm not trying to kill everybody's hopes and dreams here some people would say hey you're being negative let's be positive it's the most positive thing you can do when you have organized directed
[01:47:50.280 --> 01:48:04.280]  Overlord control surveilling everything you do controlling everything you do admittedly to then take control of the environment to engineer a post human world
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:14.280]  now again back when I read that stuff 25 years ago it was only in very elite journals then a decade ago
[01:48:14.280 --> 01:48:37.280]  it's already longer ago 18 years ago bill joy says the future doesn't need us he goes to this big tech conference 200 plus tech owners bunch of billionaires and the consensus is what do we do with the technology and do we just kill everybody or just let them like basically walley lay around in an AI system and have robots take care of them
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:52.280]  he said the decision was we're gonna kill you so this is out of CNBC is also an article in business insider 16 parts of China are now using Skynet that's not the Terminator
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:49:08.280]  remember I told you the Pentagon had a plan and I put it in my book the Senate Ernie 2002 I said there's a global grid of cameras and satellites and blimps that will track everything you do in real time read my book and they call it Skynet
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:24.280]  and then they just condition you with these movies and the world Federation of scientists got a secret document in 2000 they reclassified at the request of the Marine Corps about how the main plan is once the world government's put in place if they allow humans to live it will only be in virtual reality
[01:49:24.280 --> 01:49:40.280]  and they'll basically kill you and upload your brain or they're gonna put you in a tank at birth and then you and your heat will power things you know like that's the matrix no the matrix is them conditioning you and preparing you and I know this sounds insane they're insane I'm not the one doing this
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:56.280]  I just warn you that you know half the frogs are sterile and another third of those that aren't sterile or gay that's the homosexuals the word new scientists used a decade ago but they don't want you to know that so they just say Jones says the frogs are a
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:14.280]  hahahaha that matter it's on PBS democracy now just hot hot that big it David Hogg goes on see spend it says so what if there's more gay people that's good do do do it's not about if there's good to be gay or not it's about it's being done artificially
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:22.320]  But 16 parts of China are now using Skynet, the facial recognition tech that can scan
[01:50:22.320 --> 01:50:26.040]  the country's entire population in a second, and the entire world population currently
[01:50:26.040 --> 01:50:28.440]  in two seconds wants its employees.
[01:50:28.440 --> 01:50:34.600]  And you'll have a global social score already in China, where if you don't dress nice, aren't
[01:50:34.600 --> 01:50:37.640]  polite, everything will be downgraded, and then there'll be more, and more you've got
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:43.520]  to do, to comply with the all-seeing eye.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:48.080]  It's an attempt at building God, as Ray Kurzweil, the head of Google Futures Development Program,
[01:50:48.080 --> 01:50:53.720]  said, more than 20 years ago, I don't believe in God yet.
[01:50:53.720 --> 01:50:57.000]  And there is a race to be that God.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:00.200]  I will be that God.
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:03.240]  A bunch of crazy people going, I'm going to be a God.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.240]  No, I'll be.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.240]  It's my Loch Narn.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.240]  No, it's mine.
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:07.240]  No, it's mine.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:08.240]  Oh.
[01:51:08.240 --> 01:51:09.240]  Oh, yes.
[01:51:09.240 --> 01:51:10.240]  Oh.
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:22.560]  Meanwhile, behind the facade of this innocent-looking media matters, George Soros, the Nazi collaborator,
[01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:27.640]  is all in the catbird seat for the big plan.
[01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:36.320]  And the globalists have told me off-record, their emissaries, one on record, the head
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:39.880]  of the Kissinger Group at the time, John Harmon was a witness to it, and the guy that
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:42.280]  said off-record, so I talked about it.
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.760]  He said, just come on up here to New York, Alex.
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:44.760]  You're going to love it.
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:45.760]  It's a good plan.
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:46.760]  You need to be with us.
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:54.760]  You're in the superclass, and you can lead this whole movement, and you can have input.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.760]  And I said, nope.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.760]  He said, well, I just think you're crazy.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.600]  I don't think that you're just crazy.
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:04.200]  I came on here as we could talk, and I could give you this offer.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:06.760]  Okay, fine, whatever.
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:11.640]  Boy, I don't want a world government where the elite think they're going to kill everybody.
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:13.280]  Yeah, it doesn't sound too good.
[01:52:13.280 --> 01:52:15.960]  And then their arguments always, well, look at the dumb public.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:16.960]  They hate you.
[01:52:16.960 --> 01:52:17.960]  You'll never help them.
[01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:18.960]  They're not going to care about you.
[01:52:18.960 --> 01:52:21.480]  And see, that's the thing.
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.440]  Even if the public are a bunch of greedy, stupid, dumb-down selfish people on average,
[01:52:25.440 --> 01:52:31.880]  I'm not signing on to knowingly poison people, dumb them down so I can sit up in a palace
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:38.440]  on top of mountain skulls and hang around with a bunch of you weirdo-globalist, because
[01:52:38.440 --> 01:52:39.440]  I can tell you one thing.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:40.800]  You're not going to become AI.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:42.440]  You're not going to become a god.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:46.160]  You're crap.
[01:52:46.160 --> 01:52:49.520]  And the Communist Chinese are a bunch of wicked, evil control freaks.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:51.280]  We shouldn't be building this.
[01:52:51.280 --> 01:52:52.880]  We shouldn't be putting this in.
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:55.920]  We shouldn't be doing it.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:53:02.600]  The 5G is hundreds of times stronger than the earlier systems.
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.960]  It will fry you.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:06.600]  It will kill you.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:13.680]  And they'll have 6G and 10G and 100G, because, you know, you don't want to wait 30 seconds
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:16.560]  to download a two-hour movie on 4G.
[01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:20.760]  You got to have it in a millisecond and show it off to your buddies, even though it's killing
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:21.760]  you.
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:28.160]  And as I said in all the studies, old-fashioned cell phones cause heart attacks because they
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:33.440]  manipulate and trigger the cells that are in the heart that are electrochemical that
[01:53:33.440 --> 01:53:39.760]  fire the heart.
[01:53:39.760 --> 01:53:44.400]  That's why they're associated with heart attacks and heart cancer, something that didn't even
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.800]  really exist before.
[01:53:45.800 --> 01:53:47.320]  It's very rare.
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:49.760]  This is all in LA Times now.
[01:53:49.760 --> 01:53:55.360]  See, they're telling you, now that it's ubiquitous, it's okay to tell you.
[01:53:55.360 --> 01:53:59.440]  Now that it's already on every street corner, it's all right.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:03.520]  And right around the corner, they're about to announce the humanoids.
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:10.440]  Oh, and they're going to have rights, of course, but they're going to work for the corporations
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:11.440]  and they're going to have backdoors.
[01:54:11.440 --> 01:54:17.200]  They're going to be programmed, genetically programmed, with the exact traits they want.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:20.200]  And it's going to be so sexy and so cool that everyone's going to want to have them.
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:26.200]  And there'll be a choreographed mob scene where some bad thugs beat up and kill a beautiful
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:29.920]  young female humanoid named Lexi or something.
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.000]  And they'll be a bit compacted.
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:34.240]  Oh, we've got to accept them.
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:36.120]  That means accept what the engineers make and do.
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.880]  And it's game over.
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:38.880]  Door's blown wide open.
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:45.080]  And they're going to make it where we can't have children and we've got to go to the government
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:50.240]  because the genes and the eggs and the sperm are so fried, this is all on record already.
[01:54:50.240 --> 01:54:51.240]  Children of men.
[01:54:51.240 --> 01:54:54.480]  You'll have to go to them to have your child, but it won't be a child under agreements and
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:54:55.480]  compacts.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.240]  There'll be certain attitudinal adjustments and things that are done.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:01.800]  And, you know, oh, yes, we're going to splice your genetics, but how about all this?
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:03.360]  And it's all just done so easy.
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:08.080]  And, Ply, you're against two women having a child and splicing their genetics?
[01:55:08.080 --> 01:55:09.080]  You're against two men?
[01:55:09.080 --> 01:55:10.080]  What, are you a homophobe?
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:13.240]  You're like, no, actually, that's not a human.
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:15.120]  You got to have a man and woman.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:16.280]  Oh, shut up.
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:17.640]  There's no chromosomal differences.
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:21.240]  What, next you'll tell us there's gay frogs.
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:26.000]  And it's all, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:32.760]  Oh, it's not scary to have the Communist Chinese that have had millions of Buddhists taken
[01:55:32.760 --> 01:55:37.800]  into custody and killed for their organs.
[01:55:37.800 --> 01:55:42.760]  Oh, the left all like Buddhism and yoga and they all wear their little shaman beads and
[01:55:42.760 --> 01:55:47.440]  they're all part of their trendy, cool exercise cults and everyone's bouncing beach balls
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:51.240]  and they'll go into Vegas and, oh, Alex Jones is a troublemaker.
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:52.840]  Ah, let's be positive.
[01:55:52.840 --> 01:55:58.680]  Oh, for Winfrey, Anthony Robbins, and I'm not knocking Robbins, he has a lot of good
[01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:05.880]  points, but it's this, yes, the most positive thing I can do is be a information warfare
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:08.680]  suicide bomber.
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:10.440]  The only person that dies is me.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:14.680]  The only one that gets killed or destroyed or demonized or hung up there upside down
[01:56:14.680 --> 01:56:15.680]  across is me.
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:16.680]  And you know what?
[01:56:16.680 --> 01:56:19.120]  I'm not doing it because I'm a martyr or I'm a saint.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.800]  I'm smart and I've read their writings and now it's all out the open and this is an anti-human
[01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:29.000]  murderous plan that makes Hitler look like an angel.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:33.280]  And you know what, humanity, you've been warned and if you don't care and if you don't pull
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:38.040]  out of this and if you don't say no, God don't have wireless in your house, take the cell
[01:56:38.040 --> 01:56:39.040]  phones away from your kids.
[01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:40.600]  I know, I even have trouble.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:44.360]  We're already so deep in the bacon grease, folks, they're coming out of the cell phones
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:47.800]  track you in live time with their cameras and know your emotions and report it back
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:50.120]  to the Chinese government.
[01:56:50.120 --> 01:56:53.480]  Remember the Apple apps years ago already had them on the phone where it knows you're
[01:56:53.480 --> 01:56:56.800]  sleeping or your heart rate when you're not even holding the thing.
[01:56:56.800 --> 01:57:04.120]  It's a robot hooked into the entire global government watching everything you do in real
[01:57:04.120 --> 01:57:06.520]  time in their admission.
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:12.880]  I haven't plugged in two hours and you know what, I'm not even going to plug today.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.480]  X2 is selling out, me and everybody will get it again, it's a real high 50% off, whatever.
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:20.520]  People need to flood us with capital because I'm under attack, I need to expand in the
[01:57:20.520 --> 01:57:23.760]  face of this and I'm totally dedicated and they're into a place better to spend your
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.960]  money and get great products and stand for the First Amendment, Second Amendment, the
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:27.960]  whole shooting match.

[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:15.360]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:17.080]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[02:00:17.080 --> 02:00:21.240]  I want to just put bookends on when I was just covering a moment ago.
[02:00:21.240 --> 02:00:26.640]  The casino gulag is what the internet is about and having Twitter, Facebook, Google let you
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:32.120]  spread your information, let you communicate with people is a social control they have
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:35.800]  where if you're not a good little globalist, they don't let you spread your information.
[02:00:35.800 --> 02:00:39.120]  When you're a good little globalist, they let you spread it and that's the Chinese
[02:00:39.120 --> 02:00:43.640]  global social score that even the Wall Street Journal admits is now being adopted worldwide.
[02:00:43.640 --> 02:00:47.520]  We first told you about it five years ago when it was first announced, tomorrow's news
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:49.160]  today.
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:51.440]  And so that's where all this is going.
[02:00:51.440 --> 02:00:56.360]  Most people have already sold out just to be able to have more social interaction on
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:57.360]  the internet.
[02:00:57.360 --> 02:01:01.120]  So imagine as they get more control over as they're going to engineer more and more.
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:05.600]  But first, false flags are important.
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:13.560]  Full weapons in Syria at least 52 times, UN reports says New York Times.
[02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:19.120]  Now remember, they're telling you unanimously on CNN and Fox News that Assad used chemicals
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:20.120]  with no proof.
[02:01:20.120 --> 02:01:22.240]  We are breaking news out of Syria this morning.
[02:01:22.240 --> 02:01:27.120]  There's new video from Eastern Ghouta that's a suburb of Damascus showing several people,
[02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:30.280]  Syrian activists say were attacked with a suspected chemical agent.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:35.600]  The information that we have is that apparently around 8.30 last night a helicopter, this
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:40.880]  is according to rebel and opposition media sources, a helicopter from the Syrian government
[02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:46.240]  apparently dropped some sort of improvised explosive device called a barrel bomb.
[02:01:46.240 --> 02:01:50.360]  And then after that happened, many people in that Eastern Ghouta region, specifically
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:56.160]  the neighborhood of Duma, came down with respiratory problems and that's also shortly afterwards
[02:01:56.160 --> 02:02:01.320]  that we found or got those videos that then came out of those people with those respiratory
[02:02:01.320 --> 02:02:06.800]  problems of doctors trying to help them and in general would seem to be a panic in that
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:07.800]  area.
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:16.280]  Now, this is just out today by Zero Hedge linking to the website of the OPCW, the Western
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:22.880]  US European backed Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Organization, the Organization of
[02:02:22.880 --> 02:02:26.400]  Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, they said that they were blocked by rebel shooting
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:31.360]  at them, not the Russians that invited them in and that they are collating data to see
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:36.320]  you launch the chemical attack and in previous reports just like the UN, they have said that
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:38.800]  it was the rebels launching the chemical attacks, not Assad.
[02:02:38.800 --> 02:02:43.040]  Yeah, you can look at motive, Assad's won, the Russians are pulling out, the US is pulling
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.040]  out.
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:50.440]  Why would you nerve gas 50 civilians, it's amazing.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:58.440]  But meanwhile, ISIS threatens Satanic CNN, the Federal Reserve, Universal Studios and
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.440]  NASA.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:05.960]  So, now when there's attacks you see on Hollywood and the rest of it, O.C., Hollywood are good
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:06.960]  guys.
[02:03:06.960 --> 02:03:09.920]  People always ask, why don't the terrorists, why don't they always target some random
[02:03:09.920 --> 02:03:13.480]  federal building or always target some Christian church, why don't they ever target the Federal
[02:03:13.480 --> 02:03:15.520]  Reserve or UN?
[02:03:15.520 --> 02:03:20.920]  Well now we've got big colored photos put up by ISIS showing them shooting at CNN, even
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:29.240]  though CNN backed the Arab Spring, they backed the ISIS attacks, they backed the whole takeover.
[02:03:29.240 --> 02:03:33.160]  Obama backed ISIS invading and stood down and funded them, Hillary did.
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:39.440]  Barack Obama is to blame for the rise of ISIL, he has dismantled the ability to defend
[02:03:39.440 --> 02:03:40.440]  this country.
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:50.120]  I'm not going to telegraph in any specifics what we would do in the event of credible
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:56.680]  evidence that the Assad regime has resorted to using chemical weapons against their own
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:03:57.680]  people.
[02:03:57.680 --> 02:04:07.720]  But suffice it to say we are certainly planning to take action if that eventuality were to
[02:04:07.720 --> 02:04:08.720]  occur.
[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:13.280]  Now you see they're fighting them for TV viewers, let's do a document cam shot and I can show
[02:04:13.280 --> 02:04:17.680]  folks the entire shot, there it is, with a so-called ISIS fighter with a heavy machine
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:22.800]  gun shooting at the Federal Reserve and CNN.
[02:04:22.800 --> 02:04:27.640]  Comparison between an ISIS recruits journey and that of Luke Skywalker, researchers say
[02:04:27.640 --> 02:04:29.040]  is uncanny.
[02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:35.640]  So now you see them lining up the false flags against those groups to make them victims
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:39.160]  just like the feds bombed Oklahoma City in 1995.
[02:04:39.160 --> 02:04:44.280]  I've interviewed the witnesses, the police officers, everybody involved, we know exactly
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:46.240]  how they did it and I stand by that.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:51.440]  The media never challenges me on saying Oklahoma City was a false flag because they know who
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:56.760]  was involved, they know who covered it up, they know exactly what happened.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:03.080]  I'm so excited, the new product at m4warslife.com, in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[02:05:03.080 --> 02:05:07.880]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[02:05:07.880 --> 02:05:13.360]  This is a heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it, but
[02:05:13.360 --> 02:05:16.360]  boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:22.520]  Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:29.280]  but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae and I came
[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:34.200]  up with our own formulae working with some scientists and developers, non-GMO, made right
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:40.640]  here in America, 120 capsules and ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it, which
[02:05:40.640 --> 02:05:45.440]  is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to even make the hormones
[02:05:45.440 --> 02:05:49.560]  in your glands, it is amazing.
[02:05:49.560 --> 02:06:17.840]  Good pill now available at m4warsstore.com and your purchase fugs the operation.
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.880]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:06:23.880 --> 02:06:30.400]  I am your host Alex Jones and we are seeing political correctness just get more and more
[02:06:30.400 --> 02:06:31.400]  insane.
[02:06:31.400 --> 02:06:32.400]  Again, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.400 --> 02:06:33.400]  We have our guest, Shiva.
[02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:41.720]  We're going to be going to here in just a moment, Shiva4Senate.com at VaShiva.
[02:06:41.720 --> 02:06:45.440]  They're on Twitter and he's a doctor, he is the inventor of the internet.
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:46.440]  That's actually true.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:49.920]  I actually went and looked it up years ago when I'd heard about it and knew that he was
[02:06:49.920 --> 02:06:55.920]  a patron and a conservative, just totally blew me away.
[02:06:55.920 --> 02:07:02.560]  Real Indian running against Senator Elizabeth Warren, Suze After City tells him to stop
[02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:07.880]  calling her fake Indian.
[02:07:07.880 --> 02:07:13.880]  So Shiva Iodore is our guest and it isn't just about him running for Senate or the fact
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:17.840]  he's the person we need in the U.S. Senate and he's a Libertarian conservative patriot.
[02:07:17.840 --> 02:07:18.920]  It's that she is such a fraud.
[02:07:18.920 --> 02:07:23.400]  The Native American groups have said that she is not part of the tribes they claim.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:28.440]  She could simply release her ancestry with a genetic test, but you notice she doesn't
[02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:29.440]  and it doesn't matter.
[02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:33.120]  At the point is she's just a fraud or policies or what really matters.
[02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:35.080]  You know, she supported Trump bombing Syria.
[02:07:35.080 --> 02:07:37.680]  The one thing I'm mad at Trump about, she's bad news.
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:43.000]  A self-described real Indian who is running against Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth
[02:07:43.000 --> 02:07:51.520]  Warren, the suing city officials demanding they not pick down his signs, but they're
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:54.000]  saying you're not allowed to call her a fake Indian.
[02:07:54.000 --> 02:07:56.280]  That's, that's mean.
[02:07:56.280 --> 02:07:58.880]  So now if it's a Democrat, you can't be mean in politics.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:08:05.760]  How many times is Twitter taken down congressmen and women's reelection video ads that they
[02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:10.120]  run on their own Twitter accounts, but the Democrats can't.
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:12.960]  It's a solid wall of censorship.
[02:08:12.960 --> 02:08:16.680]  So hopefully if he gets in the U.S. Senate, he can help put a stop to that.
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:19.640]  Also get his take as an engineer and an internet expert.
[02:08:19.640 --> 02:08:24.280]  They're claiming that the head of the FCC has ended net neutrality and is killing the
[02:08:24.280 --> 02:08:25.280]  internet.
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:29.320]  But the way I read it is Obama was killing the free internet with his net neutrality package
[02:08:29.320 --> 02:08:31.160]  calling it net neutrality.
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:35.560]  It's all semantical games and we've just gone back to what we had is calling it the Internet
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:36.560]  Freedom Act.
[02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:40.760]  So we'll talk about that right now with our guest.
[02:08:40.760 --> 02:08:46.960]  And again, it is imperative that Dr. Siva get into office.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:50.960]  But first let's just get into the censorship that we're dealing with.
[02:08:50.960 --> 02:08:55.320]  This is, this is becoming outrageous.
[02:08:55.320 --> 02:08:58.480]  So doc, tell us how this began and the current state of the campaign and what happened to
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:09:01.400]  your powerful posters.
[02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:07.320]  So Alan, I mean, Alex, it's a very, very interesting set of events.
[02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:09.800]  The bottom line is, you know, I own a building in Cambridge.
[02:09:09.800 --> 02:09:14.480]  I actually pay about $70,000 a year in property taxes, so it's not cheap.
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:18.160]  And we have about, you know, 70 to 80 parking spots there.
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:25.720]  Back in March of last year, Alex, our team of, you know, local citizens, local workers
[02:09:25.720 --> 02:09:28.720]  took an old school bus and they refurbished it.
[02:09:28.720 --> 02:09:33.720]  And we had it parked in one of the front set of parking lots.
[02:09:33.720 --> 02:09:37.600]  And it had the slogan, you know, Siva for Senate, be the light.
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:38.600]  And that was fine.
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:42.880]  Two months later in June of 2017, that slogan then changed to Siva for Senate, fight for
[02:09:42.880 --> 02:09:44.760]  America.
[02:09:44.760 --> 02:09:48.520]  March of this year, Alex, after that bus has been out there for almost, you know, close
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:52.760]  to a year before the St. Patrick's Day parade where millions showed up, by the way, who
[02:09:52.760 --> 02:09:56.440]  loved our bus, loved the slogan, you can see it online, people cheering us.
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:10:01.320]  On March 17th, 2018, we decided to change the slogan to only the real Indian can defeat
[02:10:01.320 --> 02:10:06.320]  the fake Indian with that very powerful meme with a picture of me and a picture of Warren.
[02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:07.920]  Now everyone can see it.
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:09.760]  And that went viral.
[02:10:09.760 --> 02:10:14.280]  Literally two weeks after that, we get a letter from the city of Cambridge saying that if
[02:10:14.280 --> 02:10:18.600]  we do not remove that slogan, we will be fined $300 a day.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.760]  And obviously, they had no problem with the two other messages, so it's clearly political
[02:10:22.760 --> 02:10:27.520]  bias, and it's clearly trying to censor speech and trying to control speech.
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:30.440]  Because the power of that slogan, Alex, is what they want to control.
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:35.520]  I mean, we have people stopping by the building, 50,000 people pass by, people take pictures
[02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.240]  of that sign.
[02:10:37.240 --> 02:10:42.360]  Because at the heart of it, Alex, it hits at a very, very deep sentiment, which is the
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.200]  entire process.
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:48.120]  Not only Elizabeth Warren, who's obviously a fake Indian, you know, I sent her three
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:49.120]  DNA tests.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:50.280]  I pioneered that.
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:54.880]  She returned them, refused them, and I take full credit for her jumping out of the presidential
[02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:57.440]  race because we've destroyed her credibility.
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:01.640]  But the heart of that slogan is it also exposes the deep state.
[02:11:01.640 --> 02:11:05.600]  And all of these fake career politicians, or all of them are fake, Alex.
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:08.160]  And that is why the city has done this.
[02:11:08.160 --> 02:11:10.200]  It's not just a building code violation.
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:13.240]  In fact, the ridiculous thing is there's no signage on the building.
[02:11:13.240 --> 02:11:15.480]  It's on a moving vehicle on a bus.
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:17.520]  So that's a background on this, Alex.
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:21.640]  And I think it's a amazing opportunity, because think about what Cambridge represents.
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:23.640]  This is where all the liberal elites are.
[02:11:23.640 --> 02:11:29.080]  This is in the cradle of Massachusetts, which was a cradle of the American Revolution.
[02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:33.400]  What better place to defeat these guys right at the Death Star, that's what I call it,
[02:11:33.400 --> 02:11:35.800]  or the sewer that feeds the Washington swamp.
[02:11:35.800 --> 02:11:36.800]  That's right.
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:37.960]  Dr. Shiva, I.U.
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.320]  Ray, I'm teleprompter free, and sometimes I go cattywampus.
[02:11:41.320 --> 02:11:43.600]  He invented email, not the internet.
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:46.080]  We all know that was Al Gore.
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:49.080]  We all know it wasn't U.S. and British scientists, it was Al Gore.
[02:11:49.080 --> 02:11:50.080]  Yeah.
[02:11:50.080 --> 02:11:51.080]  Yeah.
[02:11:51.080 --> 02:11:52.080]  He invented email.
[02:11:52.080 --> 02:11:53.080]  Not electronic messaging.
[02:11:53.080 --> 02:11:54.080]  The email inbox outbox.
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:55.080]  That's what I did.
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:57.280]  So I don't want to take credit for something I didn't, but I invented email the system
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:58.280]  as we know it.
[02:11:58.280 --> 02:12:03.160]  And in fact, even in that story, or the truth of that story, Alex, it's fascinating to see
[02:12:03.160 --> 02:12:06.200]  how the military industrial complex of deep state reacts, right?
[02:12:06.200 --> 02:12:10.720]  So they are all out, and the media is all out to defend Elizabeth Warren on this issue.
[02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:11.880]  They don't want to discuss it.
[02:12:11.880 --> 02:12:13.480]  They want to call me a racist.
[02:12:13.480 --> 02:12:16.480]  By the way, on the invention of email, they try to flip it the other way, right?
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.120]  But the fact is it's absolute truth because the fact is the invention of email didn't
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.360]  come out of the military industrial complex.
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:25.800]  It was invented by an American boy in Newark, New Jersey.
[02:12:25.800 --> 02:12:29.560]  So at the heart of all of what we're saying, Alex, and I think the power of the slogan
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:34.760]  is that it's really reflecting the hypocrisy of the deep state, and that's why they want
[02:12:34.760 --> 02:12:35.760]  to stop it.
[02:12:35.760 --> 02:12:36.760]  And think about it.
[02:12:36.760 --> 02:12:40.880]  We're right in the center of Cambridge, Massachusetts, where Harvard is, where Elizabeth Warren's
[02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:41.880]  backyard is.
[02:12:41.880 --> 02:12:44.960]  And by the way, Harvard is a $40 billion hedge fund.
[02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:45.960]  It's not a university.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:49.960]  It's actually a fake university that makes billions from investing in all these platforms.
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:50.960]  So is UT.
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:55.160]  They're no longer universities, and they want to just hamstring their classes with political
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:58.840]  correctness and mental illness so they never think that they got worthless degrees when
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:12:59.840]  they leave.
[02:12:59.840 --> 02:13:00.840]  Exactly.
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:03.840]  And most of these kids, by the way, if you come down to the real issues we're addressing
[02:13:03.840 --> 02:13:10.880]  in Massachusetts, you have for every 17 skilled jobs, only one person is skilled.
[02:13:10.880 --> 02:13:14.200]  So you're producing a bunch of people with degrees who actually have no skills.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:15.720]  And at the other part of the slogan, we think...
[02:13:15.720 --> 02:13:20.680]  And they're meant to be plugged in to the whole new social system that that small percentage,
[02:13:20.680 --> 02:13:25.960]  the brain bugs, know about with their special PhDs, to then control all these dysfunctional
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:27.440]  people that don't have a future.
[02:13:27.440 --> 02:13:32.320]  They're creating a permanent, dependent class, not just a welfare recipients, but of educated
[02:13:32.320 --> 02:13:33.320]  idiots.
[02:13:33.320 --> 02:13:34.320]  And that's their admitted plan.
[02:13:34.320 --> 02:13:35.320]  Exactly.
[02:13:35.320 --> 02:13:37.480]  I think educated idiots is the right word for it.
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:42.720]  And think about where we are a mile from where the bus is, is Elizabeth Warren's home, it's
[02:13:42.720 --> 02:13:46.640]  where Harvard Law School is, all of these major universities are here.
[02:13:46.640 --> 02:13:49.680]  So we're not going to let this go because that's where we're going to fight.
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:53.680]  We're not going to give the city one penny and anyone listening out there, be a part
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:54.680]  of this.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:14:00.200]  This is a huge historic opportunity to help us because people think a D or a Democrat
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:02.120]  or a Republican is what fights for us.
[02:14:02.120 --> 02:14:03.120]  That's the machinery.
[02:14:03.120 --> 02:14:08.040]  We're running as independence and our thing is to really declare our independence as Americans
[02:14:08.040 --> 02:14:09.040]  and take back.
[02:14:09.040 --> 02:14:11.560]  Well, regardless, you've already been real successful with your companies and the background.
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:12.560]  People look it up.
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:13.560]  You get the credit for email.
[02:14:13.560 --> 02:14:16.520]  There are already some similar systems, but you codified it, developed a system that worked
[02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:17.520]  better.
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:18.520]  You get the credit.
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:20.320]  And it just shows they don't want to give anybody any credit.
[02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:21.320]  We need entrepreneurs.
[02:14:21.320 --> 02:14:22.520]  We need doctors.
[02:14:22.520 --> 02:14:23.520]  We need scientists.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:24.520]  We need farmers.
[02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:28.440]  We need engineers in Congress, not 80% lawyers.
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:30.720]  We do not need more lawyers.
[02:14:30.720 --> 02:14:35.040]  We got 90% lawyers and you actually think about it and none of these guys really understand
[02:14:35.040 --> 02:14:36.320]  the future, right?
[02:14:36.320 --> 02:14:39.480]  That's why they're not really, that's why they need all these political consultants.
[02:14:39.480 --> 02:14:41.360]  That's why they need to raise all this money.
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:42.360]  They're blind.
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:45.000]  They're culturally blind.
[02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:48.720]  They're basically stupid guys who got in because the only thing they know how to do, Alex,
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:50.040]  they know how to manipulate.
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:51.720]  They know how to manipulate the system.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:53.360]  That's what they have zero skills.
[02:14:53.360 --> 02:14:57.600]  Our entire platform is built on three things, clean government, term limits.
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:58.920]  Let's handcuff these guys.
[02:14:58.920 --> 02:15:00.560]  Let's get rid of the lobbyists.
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:03.520]  When we talk about real health, it's about we need real food.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:05.040]  Like you said, we need more farmers.
[02:15:05.040 --> 02:15:06.320]  We need more organic food.
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:12.640]  We need lower cost organic food locally grown, not Amazon, not industrialized organic food.
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:17.120]  And then when you go to actually think about real jobs, we need more Votek schools.
[02:15:17.120 --> 02:15:22.000]  When we say a real Indian defeats a fake Indian, all of us are on reservations now.
[02:15:22.000 --> 02:15:26.400]  If you think about it, not only the Native Americans have been put on reservations forcibly,
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:31.920]  but also for whites, for blacks, for Hispanics, the level of dysfunction that they've caused
[02:15:31.920 --> 02:15:33.120]  is what we want to bust up.
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:34.120]  Well, they're really scared of you.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:37.240]  I'd love it if you got in the Senate, but regardless, you're getting a lot of word out
[02:15:37.240 --> 02:15:38.240]  and spreading the word.
[02:15:38.240 --> 02:15:41.440]  I know you're looking good in some of the polls, but you're bold to be doing this.
[02:15:41.440 --> 02:15:45.240]  Again, Dr. Sheba will be right back on the other side of this break.
[02:15:45.240 --> 02:15:47.240]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com.
[02:15:47.240 --> 02:15:50.320]  If he's got time to stay, open the phones up.
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:51.320]  He can take your questions.
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:54.080]  We'll also talk about some of the big issues in the news.
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:15:55.080]  Stay with us.
[02:15:55.080 --> 02:15:59.160]  Attention, business owners and independent contractors, this is a money-saving message

[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:31.840]  its own.
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:37.040]  The IRS can seize your bank accounts, your home, and even shut down your business.

[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:46.280]  on your business.

[02:16:55.240 --> 02:16:59.720]  Heart disease is on the rise, clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol
[02:16:59.720 --> 02:17:03.880]  levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[02:17:03.880 --> 02:17:08.800]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:12.440]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[02:17:12.440 --> 02:17:16.960]  Remember how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives
[02:17:16.960 --> 02:17:17.960]  across America.
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:21.880]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved.
[02:17:21.880 --> 02:17:25.520]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look, and I'm telling everyone how much
[02:17:25.520 --> 02:17:26.520]  healthier I feel.
[02:17:26.520 --> 02:17:29.200]  I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:34.360]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.840]  to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:45.040]  Remember your two-month supply today by calling 866-295-5305, that's 866-295-5305, or order
[02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:56.200]  online, hbextract.com, heart and body extract, 866-295-5305, or hbextract.com.
[02:17:56.200 --> 02:18:00.840]  After years of research working with top developers here in the United States with the latest
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:07.600]  cutting-edge science, we are rolling out three new digestive gut aids.
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:13.560]  One of them is a powerful, pro-digestive enzyme, carnivore, for being able to break down meat
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:20.040]  and other proteins better, and then the other two is a powerful 50 billion live probiotic
[02:18:20.040 --> 02:18:26.200]  culture of the very best strains in fluorolife advanced restoration, and we also have an
[02:18:26.200 --> 02:18:33.640]  everyday extremely affordable fluorolife everyday maintenance, but all of these are the very
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:39.920]  cutting-edge, top-of-the-line probiotics and digestive enzymes at an extremely affordable
[02:18:39.920 --> 02:18:40.920]  price.
[02:18:40.920 --> 02:18:46.680]  That is my goal here, is to bring you the very best at the lowest price.
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:52.560]  When you purchase it at m4store.com, you know you are also financing the attack on the globalist
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:56.440]  and the defense of our republic and freedom worldwide.
[02:18:56.440 --> 02:19:00.960]  The reason m4store.com has five star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want
[02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:02.440]  products I am going to use for my family.
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:06.840]  I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds the operation with the most hardcore
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:08.840]  truthful information you are going to find anywhere.
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:13.400]  So what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at m4store.com.
[02:19:13.400 --> 02:19:19.160]  If I ever forget to take them, like I have a noticeable difference, I don't feel good.
[02:19:19.160 --> 02:19:22.760]  The nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me.
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:25.520]  Yeah, I actually have just run out of my superfemale.
[02:19:25.520 --> 02:19:30.360]  I had a few bottles at my house and I have been taking it again, hitting the gym once
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:31.360]  again.
[02:19:31.360 --> 02:19:37.920]  Very exciting, feeling great, looking good, and I know my hair is luxurious once again.
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:40.080]  So obviously the superfemale is amazing.
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:41.080]  I love it.
[02:19:41.080 --> 02:19:43.760]  Nascent iodine is essential.
[02:19:43.760 --> 02:19:44.760]  Survival Shield X2.
[02:19:44.760 --> 02:19:48.120]  If there is one product that I would say is life-changing that I would suggest it's nascent
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:52.360]  iodine, Survival Shield X2, it's got a five-star rating.
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:59.440]  It's a win-win in FullWarsLife.com.
[02:19:59.440 --> 02:20:07.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:07.800 --> 02:20:21.480]  I've seen him on a lot with Owen, one of Owen's favorite guests, and it's been a long, long
[02:20:21.480 --> 02:20:26.600]  time since I've seen him on a show.
[02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:41.320]  I've probably had him on five stars myself, but I've also watched some of his other videos.
[02:20:41.320 --> 02:20:42.960]  He would be a great member of the Senate.
[02:20:42.960 --> 02:20:44.680]  He's got a great record.
[02:20:44.680 --> 02:20:48.560]  He didn't really brag about it because I brought up inventing the email.
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:49.560]  We all know it was Al Gore.
[02:20:49.560 --> 02:20:50.560]  But on the Internet, that's a joke.
[02:20:50.560 --> 02:20:51.560]  He had nothing to do with it.
[02:20:51.560 --> 02:20:55.600]  It was invented decades before by British and US scientists on record.
[02:20:55.600 --> 02:20:58.920]  Dr. Sheba has done so many other great things, and I want to get his view on the world.
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:05.920]  I want to take your calls on any issues that we've already brought up today on Kanye West,
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:09.440]  blowing a hole, as many have pointed out, in political correctness, and the fact that
[02:21:09.440 --> 02:21:14.280]  they're freaking out in America that he isn't allowed to support Trump and point out how
[02:21:14.280 --> 02:21:17.120]  racism is useful for control.
[02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:19.280]  I live in the real world.
[02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:20.280]  I'm a white guy.
[02:21:20.280 --> 02:21:21.280]  Okay?
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:22.280]  And I've been around the world too.
[02:21:22.280 --> 02:21:23.280]  You talk about racism.
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:24.280]  You talk about classism.
[02:21:24.280 --> 02:21:30.360]  It's much worse in other parts of the world, and I'm a white guy, and I know that people
[02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:35.640]  want to hang out with who's cool, who's funny, who's smart, who's successful.
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:39.120]  That's the modern society, and you get around successful groups of people.
[02:21:39.120 --> 02:21:42.720]  There's every color in every group, and everybody just has a great time.
[02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:46.880]  It's the media and the working class trying to keep them in the working class, trying
[02:21:46.880 --> 02:21:50.360]  to make them think this is all going on so they have chips on their shoulder so they're
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:56.600]  controlled, and I'm not empatronizing here, a lot of my friends are Americans of Indian
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:22:02.840]  descent, and I do business, you know, a lot of folks, some of my friends are Indian doctors,
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:06.520]  and they're smart, they're funny, they get America, and I have Indian Americans more
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:11.080]  than anybody of any group come up to me when I'm on vacation or on the street with a hike
[02:22:11.080 --> 02:22:14.840]  and bike trail and just hug me and oh, we love you, we love Trump, and you know, hold
[02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:17.200]  on, you're going to do it, we're going to make the country great again.
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:24.840]  They get it, and it's a paradox because it seems like Indians who've been an American
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:29.360]  for a generation or two, they and people that are here knew, seem to get libertarian and
[02:22:29.360 --> 02:22:34.000]  Americana better than Americans do who've been here for 10 generations, and I just wonder
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:35.520]  what it is about Indians.
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:39.600]  I don't want to, you know, get into these issues, but I just, from an anthropology and
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:43.120]  a sociology perspective, maybe you can explain that to me, doctor.
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:48.560]  Well, you know, Alex, it's a great question, look, India is a very, very old culture, right?
[02:22:48.560 --> 02:22:52.200]  India is, you know, India is a country within countries, but one of the guiding themes within
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:57.480]  India, Alex, is India is an indigenous culture, and indigenous cultures were self-organizing
[02:22:57.480 --> 02:23:01.600]  systems, which means they were decentralized, if you think, before the British came to India,
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:08.360]  and still even, in fact, today, 87% of India's small villages, you know, small local governance.
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:11.520]  When a lot of Westerners go to India, they can't understand how India operates, it looks
[02:23:11.520 --> 02:23:16.040]  completely disorganized, completely chaotic, but it still works.
[02:23:16.040 --> 02:23:21.240]  You see this centralized form of government, which colonialism imposed or globalism, that's
[02:23:21.240 --> 02:23:27.680]  about control, and Indians, at their very nature, like, in some ways, chaos and disorganization,
[02:23:27.680 --> 02:23:33.880]  or what I call self-organizing systems, small local groups working together, local governance.
[02:23:33.880 --> 02:23:34.880]  Decentralized.
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:35.880]  Decentralized.
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:39.600]  And you think about it, when you decentralize things, no one can control it.
[02:23:39.600 --> 02:23:43.520]  And the notion of centralization by people like Elizabeth Warren or the establishment
[02:23:43.520 --> 02:23:46.560]  Republicans or Democrats is, we know better, you don't.
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:49.760]  And the reality is, I know you know better, you know you know better.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:52.400]  By the time you get up in the morning, you go to bed in the evening, I don't think about
[02:23:52.400 --> 02:23:54.880]  all the freaking decisions that you make, right?
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:23:56.400]  What to wear, what to do, what to eat.
[02:23:56.400 --> 02:23:59.320]  We don't need the government telling us what to do.
[02:23:59.320 --> 02:24:03.600]  And that's probably at the heart of all indigenous cultures, Viking cultures, Celtic cultures,
[02:24:03.600 --> 02:24:07.040]  Native American cultures, we're all real Indians at the heart of it, right?
[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:10.760]  These fake Indians want to impose their centralized model on us.
[02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:12.040]  And that's part of the theme here, right there.
[02:24:12.040 --> 02:24:13.040]  And really that's it.
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:14.280]  The US got away from the British.
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:16.840]  We made mistakes in some of the same stuff.
[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:19.400]  Indians from India were under the very same empire.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:20.920]  That's why they're so similar.
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:21.920]  Yeah.
[02:24:21.920 --> 02:24:25.880]  I mean, Indians had to think about what's going on in the 1700s.
[02:24:25.880 --> 02:24:28.880]  Americans were breaking with the British 1776.
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:33.600]  British were getting a new beachfront, 1657, the Battle of Placid takes place.
[02:24:33.600 --> 02:24:35.520]  That's why the British went to India.
[02:24:35.520 --> 02:24:39.360]  So they were fighting two battles, so they let go of America in some sense and started
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:40.680]  exploiting India.
[02:24:40.680 --> 02:24:44.400]  But the bottom line is at the heart of most Indians, and you know, you have the state
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:45.400]  of India.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:46.400]  But that shows your great understanding of history.
[02:24:46.400 --> 02:24:48.960]  A lot of folks don't know that was Britain's big two-front war, which they didn't want
[02:24:48.960 --> 02:24:49.960]  to fight again after that.
[02:24:49.960 --> 02:24:50.960]  That's one reason.
[02:24:50.960 --> 02:24:55.800]  There was so much more money, gold, power, spice, silk, everything out of India that
[02:24:55.800 --> 02:25:00.000]  they turned off the United States because we held them off for six years because India
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  was there.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.760]  And if India wasn't fighting at that time, the British would have stayed here.
[02:25:03.760 --> 02:25:04.760]  Exactly.
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:07.600]  And if you look at the history of India, it's fascinating.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:11.440]  When I look at Indian history, what's very interesting to note is that India had the
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:13.440]  establishment, which was a British colonist.
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:17.640]  India had an amazing revolutionary movement, which was actually burgeoning around the 1920s,
[02:25:17.640 --> 02:25:21.840]  which was, hey, let's also, like the Americans did, kick out the British and have a good
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:22.840]  revolution.
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:25.440]  And that's when they parachuted in guy like Gandhi.
[02:25:25.440 --> 02:25:26.440]  Okay?
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:31.560]  Gandhi, in many ways, allowed white men with crowns to leave, and the news deep state of
[02:25:31.560 --> 02:25:33.480]  brown men with white hats to take over.
[02:25:33.480 --> 02:25:37.560]  Modi, who's a near, I mean, he's not perfect by any means, but the new Prime Minister of
[02:25:37.560 --> 02:25:41.120]  India was the first breakage after 70 years of that colonial.
[02:25:41.120 --> 02:25:45.440]  And explain how they pulled out the old colonialism, but then brought in the globalism where the
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:50.680]  flag is no longer British or globalist, but exactly you've got corporate puppeteers controlling.
[02:25:50.680 --> 02:25:52.280]  That's what I covered in the last hour.
[02:25:52.280 --> 02:25:53.280]  Exactly.
[02:25:53.280 --> 02:25:57.280]  So what happened was, see, the British actually wanted to leave India by 1940.
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:00.320]  It was becoming too much of an overhead administration, right?
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:03.960]  So what they did was they got a bunch of puppet guys, right?
[02:26:03.960 --> 02:26:06.920]  Again, what I say, brown men with white hats to run India for them.
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:11.400]  It's like, you know, Procter and Gamble, initially they send the American over there, then they
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:14.200]  find the local guys to control the workers there.
[02:26:14.200 --> 02:26:15.200]  That's what happened.
[02:26:15.200 --> 02:26:19.240]  And in fact, if you look at the head of Microsoft and the head of Google, theory of these two
[02:26:19.240 --> 02:26:23.080]  Indian guys, they're basically, in my view, neocolonialists, right?
[02:26:23.080 --> 02:26:27.740]  They, you know, so it's the same model that the globalists do in a different way.
[02:26:27.740 --> 02:26:31.760]  So the kinds of people that you've come across, these are everyday immigrants who came from
[02:26:31.760 --> 02:26:32.760]  India.
[02:26:32.760 --> 02:26:34.240]  They recognize the power of this country.
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.600]  They value the immense value this country offers, which is based on meritocracy, rule
[02:26:38.600 --> 02:26:40.120]  of law and hard work.
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:43.440]  And the globalists, as you called them, what I call the imperialists, want to bring that
[02:26:43.440 --> 02:26:45.760]  to a decentralized model.
[02:26:45.760 --> 02:26:47.280]  And they want to put everyone on plantations.
[02:26:47.280 --> 02:26:49.040]  You just mentioned Kanye West, right?
[02:26:49.040 --> 02:26:55.240]  I was called the nation, you know, the elite liberal newspaper just called me a racist.
[02:26:55.240 --> 02:26:58.400]  They said, they put me on a map and they said, this guy's a racist.
[02:26:58.400 --> 02:27:00.400]  It's incredible.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:01.400]  Calling me a racist.
[02:27:01.400 --> 02:27:02.400]  Guy Gryffindor.
[02:27:02.400 --> 02:27:06.200]  And then Tom Arnold tells, tells, you know, black conservative women that they need to
[02:27:06.200 --> 02:27:08.200]  suck, you know what, Candace Owens.
[02:27:08.200 --> 02:27:09.200]  It's just vicious.
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:11.480]  Imagine if libertarians are conservatives, we said that.
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:12.800]  And another angle.
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:13.800]  Exactly.
[02:27:13.800 --> 02:27:20.000]  What, what, we're at a historic point, Alex, is because everyday people are waking up and
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:22.000]  they want to get off the plantation.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:27.200]  The centralized form of governance is to keep people on welfare, is to keep people on plantation,
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:28.680]  keep people unskilled.
[02:27:28.680 --> 02:27:33.240]  And that's what the republic rats have done, be it in Massachusetts or anywhere in this,
[02:27:33.240 --> 02:27:35.320]  you know, anywhere in this country.
[02:27:35.320 --> 02:27:36.800]  That's fundamentally what they've done.
[02:27:36.800 --> 02:27:37.800]  And they want to continue that.
[02:27:37.800 --> 02:27:42.800]  But people are waking up, you know, shows like yours, our campaign here are busting them
[02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:44.680]  right where it needs to be done.
[02:27:44.680 --> 02:27:46.840]  And that's why, you know, we need to defend the boss.
[02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.440]  We're not going to, we're going to actually escalate this.
[02:27:49.440 --> 02:27:55.240]  Anyone listening, if you want magnetic stickers, you know, for your vehicle, real Indian, fake
[02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:56.880]  Indian, we're going to be offering that.
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:01.440]  But we got to get the heart of this out there that people need to organize independently.
[02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:03.960]  They need to take control of their lives, you know, their own health.
[02:28:03.960 --> 02:28:07.200]  You know, one big pillar of our platform is real health.
[02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:11.320]  Elizabeth Warren voted for the Monsanto Protection Act, which means you and I cannot
[02:28:11.320 --> 02:28:13.080]  sue Monsanto anymore.
[02:28:13.080 --> 02:28:14.080]  That's what she did.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:15.840]  She voted against GMO labeling.
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:19.240]  We know that ultimately, food is medicine, right?
[02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:21.000]  That's where we get real health from.
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.720]  The other piece of it is they've also eliminated the local healer, right?
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:27.000]  In old systems of government, right?
[02:28:27.000 --> 02:28:28.000]  Old indigenous systems.
[02:28:28.000 --> 02:28:29.120]  You had the local healer.
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:31.120]  We've gotten rid of around 200,000 family practitioners.
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:35.640]  Yeah, you had apothecaries in every culture that had better track records than the so-called
[02:28:35.640 --> 02:28:36.880]  Western medicine.
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:37.880]  On fire.
[02:28:37.880 --> 02:28:38.880]  Dr. Shiva is our guest.
[02:28:38.880 --> 02:28:39.880]  We'll be back.
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:40.880]  We'll tell you how to get involved with this campaign.
[02:28:40.880 --> 02:28:43.160]  I'll give the number out and take your phone calls.
[02:28:43.160 --> 02:28:44.160]  This is critical.
[02:28:44.160 --> 02:28:46.080]  I'm going to cover something super critical when we come back.
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:55.680]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.680 --> 02:28:56.680]  This is Dan Pilla.
[02:28:56.680 --> 02:28:58.240]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:28:59.760]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[02:28:59.760 --> 02:29:02.600]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[02:29:02.600 --> 02:29:04.840]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[02:29:04.840 --> 02:29:08.640]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you there's no such thing as a hopeless
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:09.640]  case.
[02:29:09.640 --> 02:29:13.520]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[02:29:13.520 --> 02:29:17.280]  With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:19.360]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX.

[02:29:28.600 --> 02:29:31.720]  I'm a former decorated CIA officer.
[02:29:31.720 --> 02:29:35.480]  Finally someone has come out and written what I think is the best ex-Mose on the shadow
[02:29:35.480 --> 02:29:36.480]  government ever.
[02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:42.080]  We're in a constitutional crisis and our government is now being run and ruled by a shadow government.
[02:29:42.080 --> 02:29:45.280]  We've got to get this out because just because you're awake, folks, doesn't mean other people
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:46.280]  are.
[02:29:46.280 --> 02:29:49.040]  This is critical to get, to read, to give them a library, to give them a church.

[02:30:55.760 --> 02:31:02.120]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[02:31:02.120 --> 02:31:08.520]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[02:31:08.520 --> 02:31:15.760]  or videos or other material from InfoWarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[02:31:15.760 --> 02:31:20.680]  I mean, I cannot say it any clear and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[02:31:20.680 --> 02:31:21.680]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:21.680 --> 02:31:25.360]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste

[02:31:30.520 --> 02:31:31.520]  children and adults.
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:35.720]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[02:31:35.720 --> 02:31:43.560]  and iodine as well, InfoWarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands
[02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:47.120]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their

[02:31:51.360 --> 02:31:55.800]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:31:55.800 --> 02:31:58.600]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back.
[02:31:58.600 --> 02:32:04.920]  It's MycoZX plus lower price, more ingredients because we scaled up, signed to your contract
[02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:10.840]  with an even bigger organic manufacturer and producer, scalability, but now we're able
[02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:17.160]  to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off because there's a lot of product and
[02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:21.000]  a lot of ingredient, MycoZX, now it's the other side of the equation, everybody thinks
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:25.120]  about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because of toxins in the environment,
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:30.520]  pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics help displace.
[02:32:30.520 --> 02:32:36.760]  Just mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold and all
[02:32:36.760 --> 02:32:39.880]  that get in there, it causes all sorts of serious issues, well this has got a bunch
[02:32:39.880 --> 02:32:46.000]  of concentrated herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall, don't wait

[02:33:02.040 --> 02:33:21.880]  News, analysis, reports, it's the Alex Jones show, Dr. Sheeva Ayudaray is our guest, vaSheeva.com,
[02:33:21.880 --> 02:33:26.720]  SheevaForSenate.com, we've got to get him up more often, all these great guests, like
[02:33:26.720 --> 02:33:31.240]  Candace Owens, she's been on like four months, she's been on, I want her on like every week,
[02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:35.000]  she's everybody's so busy, so much is going on, there's so many great people out there.
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:41.360]  When you sit here and you think about this, the left knows what they're doing, they consciously
[02:33:41.360 --> 02:33:46.080]  create dependent groups at different levels, different caste systems and this has happened
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:51.320]  throughout cultures, royalty in Europe, India has done the same thing and that's one reason
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:54.720]  I guess Indian Americans I know recognize, the globals are bringing their own system
[02:33:54.720 --> 02:33:59.240]  in where again, you've got a giant working class, it's kept poor on purpose and you've
[02:33:59.240 --> 02:34:04.560]  got universities by design giving most people worthless degrees that you need to work within
[02:34:04.560 --> 02:34:09.040]  the system, the university's built to even have a future, so that expands that system
[02:34:09.040 --> 02:34:14.120]  because then you lobby for that, these are self perpetuating systems that attack free
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:18.880]  market and now there's big articles in AP, the hill you name it, the great exodus out
[02:34:18.880 --> 02:34:23.800]  of America's blue cities, the toll free number to join us to talk about any of these issues
[02:34:23.800 --> 02:34:31.080]  or to ask any questions of our guests, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539, questions for our guests, it
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:37.560]  can be a lot of different questions or comments but for our guest, 877-789-2539, but let me
[02:34:37.560 --> 02:34:44.800]  ask you this question, Doc, looking at this historically, every blue city is going bankrupt,
[02:34:44.800 --> 02:34:49.200]  every blue state is falling apart, they're bringing in unskilled illegal aliens from
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:56.080]  all over the world, China exploits the US, more Chinese women now come in than Mexicans
[02:34:56.080 --> 02:35:01.200]  combined, and CNN's happy about it, they have like a travel advisory, I saw two years ago
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:07.640]  to China showing a Chinese woman pushing a baby stroller and it said at the top, the
[02:35:07.640 --> 02:35:11.760]  biggest group immigrating is Chinese women, they come, they're middle class, they come
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:15.640]  from some of those wealthy families but they're spin thrifts, so they come and they have a
[02:35:15.640 --> 02:35:19.400]  baby, they come about a month before they have a baby on a travel visa, they come, they
[02:35:19.400 --> 02:35:23.080]  have the baby everything's paid for, then they have a baby that's a citizen, and they
[02:35:23.080 --> 02:35:29.320]  get welfare in the US but really live in China, and CNN's like what a great thing, but then
[02:35:29.320 --> 02:35:34.120]  of an old lady whether she be black or white or whatever, doesn't pay her taxes, they take
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:40.280]  your house, so there's this idea of like these big caravans coming out of collapsing Venezuela
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:43.840]  and all these socialist and communist countries and then Mexico lets them through on the tops
[02:35:43.840 --> 02:35:48.800]  of trains and Mexico says you be nice and you take them, but Mexico doesn't take any
[02:35:48.800 --> 02:35:52.360]  of those people, and I'm not trying to help those people but everybody knows bringing
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:56.880]  in giant third world unskilled populations will implode things if the government has
[02:35:56.880 --> 02:36:01.120]  a policy to do that on purpose and politically turn them into their minions, and so that's
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:05.120]  why this is so bad, what would you do in the US Senate and where do you think this blue
[02:36:05.120 --> 02:36:11.120]  state, blue city collapse is going because as you know, just like there's a brain drain
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:14.640]  out of countries around the world that are falling apart or a third world because they
[02:36:14.640 --> 02:36:18.840]  had bad leadership, people then come here from countries who are smart but never had
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:24.960]  a chance, they become successful, they become millionaires, billionaires, someone who's been
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.120]  through that experience, what do you predict is going to happen here because the left wants
[02:36:29.120 --> 02:36:34.640]  dependent dumb down masses, they destroy an area like Detroit, they move on, but like
[02:36:34.640 --> 02:36:39.280]  carrying locusts, the people that have eaten California to the bone are now coming here,
[02:36:39.280 --> 02:36:42.640]  where do you think this is going? Well, Alex, you bring up a lot of historical
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:47.520]  things. So look, you brought up the caste system. Let me answer this in a sort of a historical
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:52.520]  because I always look at history, right? In India, since you brought up India, India had
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:58.160]  this thing called the caste system, right? On the top of it, it was frankly the military
[02:36:58.160 --> 02:37:05.360]  industrial complex, right? You had the Brahmin elite who were considered the educated people.
[02:37:05.360 --> 02:37:08.800]  This was thousands of years ago, and then you had the warriors and the business people
[02:37:08.800 --> 02:37:15.280]  and everyone else was below them, right? That elite run by the intellectual elite basically
[02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:21.080]  created this hierarchical caste system was a very centralized form by the 1600s, believe
[02:37:21.080 --> 02:37:25.480]  it or not, that caste system was dwindling away, which a lot of people do not know even
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:30.480]  within India. When the British came, instead of imposing British law in India, which they
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:35.480]  knew people would revolt, guess what they did? They dug up pre eighth century Indian law
[02:37:35.480 --> 02:37:40.200]  and they impose that. So they essentially reimpose the caste system in India, right?
[02:37:40.200 --> 02:37:45.560]  So that's, but the point is the centralization of power is what they did. In the United States,
[02:37:45.560 --> 02:37:49.840]  I think, you know, we have a caste system here and that caste system is based on the
[02:37:49.840 --> 02:37:53.360]  educated elite, you know, in the one mile radius down over here, where, you know, down
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:57.800]  in Cambridge, the Harvard elite. And if you think about it, Harvard Law School, Harvard
[02:37:57.800 --> 02:38:00.920]  Business School, Harvard Medical School, you know, it should be busted up, right? These
[02:38:00.920 --> 02:38:06.200]  guys essentially get together and they create the laws and they create the entire narrative
[02:38:06.200 --> 02:38:10.160]  about how this country should be done and how much they're smarter than all of us.
[02:38:10.160 --> 02:38:14.720]  So we have a neo caste system in America, whether people want to, or that's what political
[02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:20.080]  correctness is, is an exact is an exact age. This is conscious authoritarianism. How do
[02:38:20.080 --> 02:38:24.320]  we counter it? Right, right. So the number one way to counter it is first of all, we
[02:38:24.320 --> 02:38:28.560]  need to go back to, you know, the principles of what this country was set up for the rule
[02:38:28.560 --> 02:38:33.160]  of law. We have the First Amendment, we have the Second Amendment, two very important amendments.
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:37.600]  The deep state has created so many problems now, Alex. They don't even know how to solve
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:41.840]  it, right? So when it comes to immigration, the way that they want to solve it is to essentially
[02:38:41.840 --> 02:38:45.320]  ensure illegal immigration so they can get votes. It's a complex system.
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:48.240]  And keep a permanent underclass as well, that they admit that.
[02:38:48.240 --> 02:38:52.160]  Exactly. So they can get votes. So the way you solve it, if we really want to solve
[02:38:52.160 --> 02:38:57.320]  it, we need a wall, right? We need to follow immigration policy. My parents came here in
[02:38:57.320 --> 02:39:01.960]  1970 on merit-based immigration. They had to submit their resume, their reference letter.
[02:39:01.960 --> 02:39:06.280]  It was an honor to come here. My dad came first. We had to wait almost a year, and then we
[02:39:06.280 --> 02:39:10.360]  came. It was not like everyone got to come. So number one, we need a wall. We need solid
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:11.920]  immigration policy.
[02:39:11.920 --> 02:39:15.400]  Second thing is we need to really address the fact that we don't have skilled labor
[02:39:15.400 --> 02:39:20.360]  in this country. You know, we create racism. We pit poor whites against poor blacks. And
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:25.000]  that's done in very conscious way by the establishment, deep state of Republicans and Democrats.
[02:39:25.000 --> 02:39:29.480]  They do this consciously. Solution to that is we need to have more vote tech schools.
[02:39:29.480 --> 02:39:33.880]  We need to educate people with actual skills. So we have skilled labor here. What they've
[02:39:33.880 --> 02:39:39.400]  done, Alex, is purposely put people on the plantation here, dumb them down. And so they
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:44.480]  say, look, we don't have enough skilled labor. And so they have to import in illegal immigrants.
[02:39:44.480 --> 02:39:48.520]  That's the second piece, right? The other piece is you have to have rule of law, right?
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:52.680]  Merit-based immigration. What's wrong with that? That's how my parents came. You had
[02:39:52.680 --> 02:39:57.320]  a skill. In fact, you go back to when immigrants from all over the country were coming. If
[02:39:57.320 --> 02:40:00.040]  you didn't have a skill, you were sent back, unfortunately.
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:06.360]  And that's what made us dominant was that we got hardworking, the best minds, all the
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:07.360]  real diversity.
[02:40:07.360 --> 02:40:12.040]  Exactly. And that was the values of this country. You had to work hard. Look, my mom
[02:40:12.040 --> 02:40:16.040]  said in India, you could get discriminated nine different ways in America three. But
[02:40:16.040 --> 02:40:19.600]  if you worked hard enough, you could even overcome that. You know, people forget there's
[02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:24.440]  something called hard work. Hard work is not a bad thing. It's a good thing. We have trained
[02:40:24.440 --> 02:40:30.560]  a whole generation of people not to work hard, not to value excellence, not to value skills.
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:34.760]  And the politicians love that because they don't have skills. They don't value excellence.
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:38.440]  And they want to essentially get into power by manipulating people and staying there as
[02:40:38.440 --> 02:40:39.440]  long as they want.
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:43.440]  And let's talk about lawyers. It's gotten so weird now. They follow these 70-page...
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:47.760]  Well, lawyers, look at their model, business model. Their business model is that they
[02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:53.640]  bill hourly, right? And basically, they want you to have a problem as long as possible.
[02:40:53.640 --> 02:40:57.400]  That's why lawyer lobbyists in Washington do not want to solve a problem. You know,
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:01.200]  when I deliver a product, if it doesn't work, they're not going to pay my invoice.
[02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:06.200]  And that's why they make Trump so much because he gets in and despite the obstructionism,
[02:41:06.200 --> 02:41:07.560]  everything starts turning around.
[02:41:07.560 --> 02:41:14.280]  Yeah. I mean, look, Donald Trump's win in 2016 was historic, right? And we don't know
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:19.360]  what level of 4D, 5D, 6D-level chess he's got to play in there. You know, like you,
[02:41:19.360 --> 02:41:23.720]  I did not like the bombing of Syria. Anyone who looks at Syria knows Assad is not our
[02:41:23.720 --> 02:41:28.800]  enemy. Russia is not our enemy. Who's our real enemy is the Saudis and the Qataris
[02:41:28.800 --> 02:41:33.280]  and these guys who want to put a pipeline in there. And they want to essentially get
[02:41:33.280 --> 02:41:35.280]  us involved in supporting their...
[02:41:35.280 --> 02:41:38.320]  Well, that's another thing that folks from India know about. What is it? The number is
[02:41:38.320 --> 02:41:43.080]  about 140 million Indians who weren't Muslims because the Muslims invaded over the last
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:44.480]  thousand years.
[02:41:44.480 --> 02:41:45.480]  Moguls, the mogul, yeah.
[02:41:45.480 --> 02:41:51.440]  140 million, 140 million Hindus and other Indians have been killed. Is that an accurate
[02:41:51.440 --> 02:41:52.440]  number?
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:57.280]  Yep. Over, over the years. I mean, and you think about, you think about 9-11, right?
[02:41:57.280 --> 02:42:03.200]  You think about essentially, look, in 1970, we moved to the petrodollar, right? We, our
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:09.560]  economy became dependent on oil and now China's coming involved and they actually want to change
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:14.520]  the reserve currency to their currency. So, in some ways, Saudi Arabia has some leverage
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:18.080]  here. And then we got to be very, very concerned about that. And that's why they want us to
[02:42:18.080 --> 02:42:23.280]  go invade Syria. I mean, the chemical attacks in Syria, I mean, it's a longer story we all
[02:42:23.280 --> 02:42:24.280]  know.
[02:42:24.280 --> 02:42:29.720]  It's just such an angle to think about how many Americans have to be Indian like Trump
[02:42:29.720 --> 02:42:33.400]  because they get the issue about the most radical forms of Islam we can't bring in here.
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:36.560]  I mean, they're all killing each other. It's a terrible thing. I'm sad for the Muslims,
[02:42:36.560 --> 02:42:39.840]  but my God, who would import something like this?
[02:42:39.840 --> 02:42:46.080]  Well, look, the bottom line is the deep state wants race war. They want fundamentalism.
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:50.600]  I mean, think about fundamentalist religions as an overall. They're centralized systems.
[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:51.600]  They love centralized systems.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:54.960]  And that's why the globalists love Islam. It's centralized. We'll be back with the
[02:42:54.960 --> 02:42:55.960]  doctor.
[02:42:55.960 --> 02:43:00.520]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. Introducing pollen block.
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:06.040]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:43:06.040 --> 02:43:12.520]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory function.
[02:43:12.520 --> 02:43:18.400]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.800]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[02:43:23.800 --> 02:43:29.160]  trials. And decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast acting, chewable
[02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:33.000]  tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[02:43:33.000 --> 02:43:38.200]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:43.040]  has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:48.760]  that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you
[02:43:48.760 --> 02:43:49.760]  breathe.

[02:46:58.960 --> 02:47:15.480]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:20.480]  You want answers? Well, so does me. It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:20.480 --> 02:47:27.360]  Well, we need to get Dr. Sheba on Fox News in places a lot more. He could easily defeat
[02:47:27.360 --> 02:47:31.560]  Elizabeth Warren, the fake Pocahontas. He's the real Indian. I want to take some of your
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:34.720]  calls this segment and the next. He's got to leave. Paul Watson is coming on. I want
[02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:40.800]  to talk to Paul about a few things that he's going to take over. But I want to go to your
[02:47:40.800 --> 02:47:44.280]  calls right now. I've just got so many other points I want to get into, but I don't want
[02:47:44.280 --> 02:47:50.560]  to sit here and hog the time. But to see the left calling Trump Hitler again and to see
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:59.200]  them saying his doctors like Hitler's doctor when it was Obama's doctor is just crazy.
[02:47:59.200 --> 02:48:05.560]  There's another article on info wars.com. Amazon wants to unlock your car to leave packages
[02:48:05.560 --> 02:48:11.160]  inside. Oh, they're saying sign up with us. Give us the code to your car. We'll have a
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:18.880]  whole toolkit on our waste of door openers and we'll why not just kill yourself on Amazon?
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:26.680]  Live as you. These are predatory centralized groups. Centralization never goes well. It's
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:31.920]  what the authoritarians always want. And that's exactly why I like the doc here. If he doesn't
[02:48:31.920 --> 02:48:35.320]  win in the Senate, I hope he does. I know he's already a very successful business owner
[02:48:35.320 --> 02:48:38.520]  and genetic engineer, all this other stuff. I'd like to get him to be a commentator for
[02:48:38.520 --> 02:48:42.160]  info wars because he's so on target. We're going to go to these phone calls, Tim and
[02:48:42.160 --> 02:48:48.240]  Jim and Marcos and Brian and James and Alex. Dr. Sheba, again, Sheba for Senate, the number
[02:48:48.240 --> 02:48:52.920]  four, Sheba for Senate.com. Everybody should check it out. Amazing stuff. Other key points
[02:48:52.920 --> 02:48:58.160]  on your radar. I think Trump's starting to turn the corner politically with the people.
[02:48:58.160 --> 02:49:01.880]  He's really winning the polls show that even though they're skewing him. He's like at 60%
[02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:05.280]  or higher right now. He's my dead reckoning, knowing all these polls are manipulated, maybe
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:08.880]  higher. The establishment's panicking. What do you think their ace card is? Because I
[02:49:08.880 --> 02:49:12.720]  don't want to get too confident here like the Wolf says in Pulp Fiction. I think it's
[02:49:12.720 --> 02:49:20.040]  time we start celebrating yet. Look, I think what we have on our side is people are awakening
[02:49:20.040 --> 02:49:26.720]  Alex and as long as Trump goes back to people, does his rallies and connects with people.
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:29.600]  That's basically where his power is going to come from. As all of us know, that's where
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:35.200]  our real power comes from. We the people, the establishment is extremely bright. They have
[02:49:35.200 --> 02:49:39.840]  all their intellectuals probably humming away, working 24 hours trying to figure out how
[02:49:39.840 --> 02:49:45.000]  to thwart him. They're very clever at all the different things. They violated the fundamentals
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:51.200]  of attorney-client privilege when they busted into Cohen's office. Now it's trying to make
[02:49:51.200 --> 02:49:55.280]  up something with Russia. It's absolutely disgusting what they're doing. It's going
[02:49:55.280 --> 02:49:59.480]  to be interesting to watch what they do, but I think they're going to hit a wall at a
[02:49:59.480 --> 02:50:05.160]  certain point. I think at that point is where we got to be really more concerned. A great
[02:50:05.160 --> 02:50:10.960]  revolutionary say, after a revolution, that's when the real fight begins. After November
[02:50:10.960 --> 02:50:13.720]  2016 is when the counter-revolution begins.
[02:50:13.720 --> 02:50:18.960]  I'm not just kissing your butt. You are so smart because Rodgers don't smart as many
[02:50:18.960 --> 02:50:23.440]  others are. And I'm like, we need protection from the president on election night. I said,
[02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:27.400]  behind the scenes, I said, the real war is about to start. And like Rodgers like, no,
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:30.760]  he's the president. It's going to be better now. And I'm like, no, man. I told her by
[02:50:30.760 --> 02:50:35.140]  the war, and the media went, Jones didn't really want Trump to win. He's depressed.
[02:50:35.140 --> 02:50:40.280]  He wanted Hillary. No, it means that we're winning now, but we just landed at Normandy,
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:43.120]  baby. The counter-offensive is coming. Get ready.
[02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:50.640]  The counter-revolution is more dangerous than the revolution. And I think if you actually
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:56.680]  look at President Trump right now, in the old days, they just shot people. Kennedy,
[02:50:56.680 --> 02:50:57.680]  that's what they did.
[02:50:57.680 --> 02:50:59.200]  Now they politically assassinate you.
[02:50:59.200 --> 02:51:04.600]  Now they character assassinate people day in and day out. That's the method of assassination.
[02:51:04.600 --> 02:51:10.120]  Right? A body, physical body assassination was the old model. Now as you wipe away someone's
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:11.120]  reputation.
[02:51:11.120 --> 02:51:14.960]  So what should I do, doctor? Because they are clearly putting me through the character
[02:51:14.960 --> 02:51:17.280]  of full Monty. I mean, it is just character assassination.
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:22.800]  Well, I think the bottom line, Alex, is you connect with soldiers like myself who are
[02:51:22.800 --> 02:51:28.520]  out there fighting. We need a network, decentralized network of guerrilla fighters communicating
[02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:34.400]  and working together. And I think that's what, you know, your media platform offers. We're
[02:51:34.400 --> 02:51:38.400]  trying to build right in the belly of the beast that right in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
[02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:43.680]  And the bottom line is we, the people, independently need to rise up and start supporting each other
[02:51:43.680 --> 02:51:47.640]  in our decentralized way. So I think the more you're out there, the more you present the
[02:51:47.640 --> 02:51:51.560]  truth, all of us, and have the gumption and the courage to do that. And, you know, my
[02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:55.960]  great grandfather said, never go for a fight. But if someone hits you once, you go hit
[02:51:55.960 --> 02:52:01.280]  them a hundred times. And that's the policy that we have to take, you know, walk quietly
[02:52:01.280 --> 02:52:05.800]  but carry a big stick, you know, and I really firmly believe that. And I think that's what
[02:52:05.800 --> 02:52:09.040]  we all need to do because that's what I'm doing. I counter sued Georgetown. They dropped
[02:52:09.040 --> 02:52:13.360]  the suit. They're going to follow another fake one. But expanding on that, you're absolutely
[02:52:13.360 --> 02:52:16.600]  right. That's where we are. We've got to be bold. We've got to take action. We can't back
[02:52:16.600 --> 02:52:21.840]  down because this is history. People need to stop being spectators and be participants.
[02:52:21.840 --> 02:52:26.600]  The deep stay and the, and the decent and the centralized form of government wants to
[02:52:26.600 --> 02:52:31.320]  depress people, right? They want people to get depressed. They want to make a sink. We
[02:52:31.320 --> 02:52:35.880]  cannot win. But documents have come out that Facebook wants you to be depressed. And so
[02:52:35.880 --> 02:52:38.040]  does Twitter. One of their executives went public again.
[02:52:38.040 --> 02:52:42.360]  Right. I mean, if you look at the whole Facebook, I mean, talk about Facebook. Here you have
[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:47.080]  Zuckerberg. By the way, you know, I go to the island of Kauai, sometimes to vacation.
[02:52:47.080 --> 02:52:51.840]  He literally has stolen lands from the native Hawaiians and is starting to build his own
[02:52:51.840 --> 02:52:56.360]  wall around his own compound. That's what this guy is. And that whole hearings that
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:53:02.160]  we saw were complete hypocrisy, right? The hearings, you talked about the net neutrality.
[02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:06.560]  The net neutrality guys talk about the telecommunication, the pipes. They don't talk about the real
[02:53:06.560 --> 02:53:11.480]  people who violate net neutrality. That's Google and Facebook. They actually own the
[02:53:11.480 --> 02:53:17.240]  software operating system platforms that help us even get onto those pipes in terms of for
[02:53:17.240 --> 02:53:21.160]  content. Exactly. Exactly. I got to have you back up just on that neutrality then the next
[02:53:21.160 --> 02:53:25.880]  few days you're still on target. And they totally dog and pony show. But, but the head
[02:53:25.880 --> 02:53:30.400]  of the FCC is, uh, is, uh, he's totally right that they're trying to bring it back the way
[02:53:30.400 --> 02:53:35.160]  it was where Google was still screwing everybody, but didn't have total control and liability
[02:53:35.160 --> 02:53:39.520]  protection just like Monsanto just got. Obama gave Monsanto protection, Google protection
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:44.480]  to censor. That's why it's all happening. Right. See, it's, it's much easier. The deep
[02:53:44.480 --> 02:53:50.920]  state is very clever. It's much easier to use a blackface to impose even more, uh, laws
[02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:54.880]  on people and subjugate people than using a white face. So, you know, Bush didn't work
[02:53:54.880 --> 02:54:00.280]  out. So they said, let's get this, uh, you know, uh, uh, African-American here who supposedly
[02:54:00.280 --> 02:54:03.160]  is going to stand for people, you know, hope and change and that kind of nonsense, which
[02:54:03.160 --> 02:54:07.440]  he delivered none on. So they're very, very clever. The deep state is extremely clever
[02:54:07.440 --> 02:54:10.920]  in how they try to pull that off with people. I think in many ways Obama's winning and
[02:54:10.920 --> 02:54:16.360]  is, and the ex exposition of him that's come out really starts making people. It's not
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:20.400]  skin color. It's about what you were talking about earlier, Alex. It's meritocracy, what
[02:54:20.400 --> 02:54:24.860]  you stand for, how you think through problems and can you actually solve problems? And that's
[02:54:24.860 --> 02:54:28.920]  what I think we're, we need a meritocracy. We need a meritocracy. We're living in a
[02:54:28.920 --> 02:54:33.400]  historic time, man. We're living in a very powerful renaissance. Look, the six, when
[02:54:33.400 --> 02:54:37.320]  the renaissance took place, it wasn't all nice. There were plagues, there were chaos
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:42.560]  wars in the midst of that wars. That's when we had enlightenment, you know, in the old
[02:54:42.560 --> 02:54:47.280]  Hindu spiritual traditions, we say, you know, a lotus flower grows in the worst garbage.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:53.520]  Right. And so whenever there's real darkness, whenever there's awesome nonsense going on,
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:56.960]  that's the opportunity for all of us to have deep insight and deep enlightenment. So I
[02:54:56.960 --> 02:55:01.520]  think we live in a great time, man, and we should all be fortunate to actually be warriors
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:05.680]  in this time. Wow. I'm impressed. I'm always impressed to come on, but you're on fire,
[02:55:05.680 --> 02:55:12.000]  man. That's got, he's a talk show right now. Let's go ahead and take a call here. Thanks
[02:55:12.000 --> 02:55:18.400]  for holding. Let's talk to Marcus in Texas. Marcus, you're on the year with the doctor.
[02:55:18.400 --> 02:55:26.760]  Go ahead. Man, these phones sometimes have problems, Marcus. I really want to be able
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:32.040]  to hear you, but it's not working. Let's go to Brian in Pennsylvania. Brian, you're on
[02:55:32.040 --> 02:55:39.360]  the year worldwide. Go ahead, Brian. How are you doing? I'm good. Go ahead. You're on
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:51.040]  the year. I was going to talk to you about the lunatic left that happened with Milo here
[02:55:51.040 --> 02:55:57.720]  last couple of days. Well, that was nuts. Let's play that clip and get our guest take
[02:55:57.720 --> 02:56:03.000]  on this. He's in a bar. They shout, get out Nazi, which is Nazi-like when he's Jewish
[02:56:03.000 --> 02:56:07.120]  and gay and has nothing to do with Nazis. And then the left celebrates it. Let's play
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:36.620]  that clip. Here it is. That's a great question. Brian, I'm glad you got in with that. I mean,
[02:56:36.620 --> 02:56:39.020]  I mean, this is the authoritarianism.
[02:56:39.020 --> 02:56:42.420]  These people call everybody Nazis, but they act just like them.
[02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:44.060]  Well, you know, Alex, if you saw that,
[02:56:44.060 --> 02:56:46.740]  that sounded like a Hitler youth group to me, right?
[02:56:46.740 --> 02:56:48.900]  People chanting mindlessly.
[02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:50.380]  I mean, look, I've talked to Milo.
[02:56:50.380 --> 02:56:52.020]  Milo's an extremely bright guy.
[02:56:52.020 --> 02:56:54.660]  The guy's extremely well-educated.
[02:56:54.660 --> 02:56:56.620]  You know, he's a performance artist, right?
[02:56:56.620 --> 02:56:57.460]  He gets it.
[02:56:57.460 --> 02:56:59.540]  He understands what's going on.
[02:56:59.540 --> 02:57:01.020]  He understands the establishment.
[02:57:01.020 --> 02:57:03.380]  You know, they just had an article on me in the nation
[02:57:03.380 --> 02:57:05.260]  saying, and it's off to the racist,
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:08.220]  literally putting up a map, calling me a KKK.
[02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:09.780]  Yeah, pull up that nation article.
[02:57:09.780 --> 02:57:10.660]  I haven't seen that article.
[02:57:10.660 --> 02:57:11.540]  You should find that article.
[02:57:11.540 --> 02:57:12.220]  It's ridiculous.
[02:57:12.220 --> 02:57:13.020]  Tell me the headline.
[02:57:13.020 --> 02:57:13.420]  What is it?
[02:57:13.420 --> 02:57:14.060]  Off to the racist?
[02:57:14.060 --> 02:57:16.460]  I think it's, yeah, it's off to the racist.
[02:57:16.460 --> 02:57:18.180]  Something like off to the racist.
[02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:23.260]  Type in Aya Durei, Google on racist on the nation.
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:24.700]  And it's a fascinating front headline.
[02:57:24.700 --> 02:57:29.660]  And as you go through it, because several months ago,
[02:57:29.660 --> 02:57:32.340]  a great artist, I thought it was a good piece of art.
[02:57:32.340 --> 02:57:33.660]  I mean, I do a lot of design myself.
[02:57:33.660 --> 02:57:36.620]  It's got the Ku Klux Klan hat on there.
[02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:38.100]  Let's come back and talk about this.
[02:57:38.100 --> 02:57:38.660]  That's right.
[02:57:38.660 --> 02:57:40.700]  If you're a free market decentralization guy
[02:57:40.700 --> 02:57:42.860]  and you're from India, you're in the KKK now.
[02:57:42.860 --> 02:57:44.980]  We'll be back.
[02:57:44.980 --> 02:57:46.900]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:57:46.900 --> 02:57:47.940]  Go ahead.
[02:57:47.940 --> 02:57:50.100]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:57:50.100 --> 02:57:52.500]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot
[02:57:52.500 --> 02:57:54.860]  and doing your best to save America
[02:57:54.860 --> 02:57:56.740]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots
[02:57:56.740 --> 02:58:00.500]  to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:58:00.500 --> 02:58:03.060]  And as a longtime InfoWars listener,
[02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:06.100]  I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[02:58:06.100 --> 02:58:07.060]  Anthroplex.
[02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:09.460]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[02:58:09.460 --> 02:58:10.380]  Thank you.
[02:58:10.380 --> 02:58:12.900]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the Super Blue toothpaste
[02:58:12.900 --> 02:58:15.380]  for you folks who aren't big, normal toothpaste fans.
[02:58:15.380 --> 02:58:17.060]  The Super Blue is awesome.
[02:58:17.060 --> 02:58:20.220]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the InfoWars Life products.
[02:58:20.220 --> 02:58:21.460]  They are quality.
[02:58:21.460 --> 02:58:23.100]  I can't wait to get some more.
[02:58:23.100 --> 02:58:25.140]  And thank you so much for doing that for us
[02:58:25.140 --> 02:58:26.060]  to keep us healthy.
[02:58:26.060 --> 02:58:27.180]  Absolutely.
[02:58:27.180 --> 02:58:30.020]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots,
[02:58:30.020 --> 02:58:33.220]  help our other countrymen and women understand
[02:58:33.220 --> 02:58:35.060]  that there's a bigger problems going on.
[02:58:35.060 --> 02:58:37.380]  And if we can get our houses in order
[02:58:37.380 --> 02:58:39.020]  and be good to each other and ourselves,
[02:58:39.020 --> 02:58:40.180]  we can take our country back.
[02:58:46.180 --> 02:58:48.580]  InfoWarsLife and InfoWarsLife.com
[02:58:48.580 --> 02:58:51.780]  is extremely excited to announce our latest release,
[02:58:51.780 --> 02:58:55.660]  Winner's Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[02:58:55.660 --> 02:58:59.300]  Winner's Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3
[02:58:59.300 --> 02:59:00.380]  nutritional supplement.
[02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:02.100]  It is produced by extracting oil
[02:59:02.100 --> 02:59:05.100]  from healthy nutrient-dense plants known as lichens.
[02:59:05.100 --> 02:59:08.180]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[02:59:08.180 --> 02:59:10.580]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[02:59:10.580 --> 02:59:13.540]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price,
[02:59:13.540 --> 02:59:14.380]  this is it.
[02:59:14.380 --> 02:59:16.540]  Winner's Sun is the result of our pursuit
[02:59:16.540 --> 02:59:18.540]  of the best source of vitamin D3.
[02:59:18.540 --> 02:59:20.900]  The research and development took over two years,
[02:59:20.900 --> 02:59:23.780]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories,
[02:59:23.780 --> 02:59:27.020]  is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[02:59:27.020 --> 02:59:29.620]  Read the facts at infowarslife.com
[02:59:29.620 --> 02:59:32.100]  about Winner's Sun, vitamin D3.
[02:59:32.100 --> 02:59:35.060]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood,
[02:59:35.060 --> 02:59:37.940]  but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function,
[02:59:37.940 --> 02:59:40.180]  something the globalists are targeting.

[02:59:45.660 --> 02:59:55.140]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:55.140 --> 03:00:04.060]  It's mind-control, mind-control, corruption of your talk.
[03:00:04.060 --> 03:00:06.460]  I was going to Jim, but he just hung up.
[03:00:06.460 --> 03:00:07.940]  We got a bunch of other callers here.
[03:00:07.940 --> 03:00:10.340]  I'll try to come to pop in to talk to the man running
[03:00:10.340 --> 03:00:12.380]  for Senate, Dr. Sheeva.
[03:00:12.380 --> 03:00:14.460]  Sheeva for senate.com.
[03:00:14.460 --> 03:00:17.340]  We really need to get this guy on the Senate, man.
[03:00:17.340 --> 03:00:18.220]  I study history.
[03:00:18.220 --> 03:00:21.180]  I get how it really works.
[03:00:21.180 --> 03:00:21.780]  We're talking.
[03:00:21.780 --> 03:00:23.980]  I bet he hardly ever listens to my show, maybe never.
[03:00:23.980 --> 03:00:24.940]  I've always been on some.
[03:00:24.940 --> 03:00:26.820]  He's just, we can finish our sentences,
[03:00:26.820 --> 03:00:28.100]  not because we're in a cult.
[03:00:28.100 --> 03:00:29.460]  We've studied history.
[03:00:29.460 --> 03:00:32.940]  And the globalists actually have above PhD-level textbooks
[03:00:32.940 --> 03:00:34.180]  that the establishment read.
[03:00:34.180 --> 03:00:36.340]  I've read them, and it's how they run it all.
[03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:39.380]  And I'm just like, why would the world not
[03:00:39.380 --> 03:00:41.460]  want to know how things run?
[03:00:41.460 --> 03:00:44.140]  And I was like a jock in the whole nine yards
[03:00:44.140 --> 03:00:46.380]  in high school and stuff.
[03:00:46.380 --> 03:00:48.420]  But I still got into history books
[03:00:48.420 --> 03:00:52.700]  and then into governmental textbooks
[03:00:52.700 --> 03:00:55.980]  because it was super interesting how the world works.
[03:00:55.980 --> 03:00:58.180]  And people think that's crazy.
[03:00:58.180 --> 03:01:00.020]  And now I've been super successful in everything
[03:01:00.020 --> 03:01:02.020]  I've done just because I'm thinking
[03:01:02.020 --> 03:01:04.220]  at the level of how the establishment's thinking,
[03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:06.060]  but not from their perspective.
[03:01:06.060 --> 03:01:09.700]  And Doc, what you're saying is that's what you've done.
[03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:11.460]  Well, look, Alex, you said you played sports.
[03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:12.980]  I played sports.
[03:01:12.980 --> 03:01:14.460]  And you studied history.
[03:01:14.460 --> 03:01:15.940]  One of the things the establishment does,
[03:01:15.940 --> 03:01:19.140]  and they're very clever, they're the biggest segregationist
[03:01:19.140 --> 03:01:19.980]  at the broader level.
[03:01:19.980 --> 03:01:21.100]  They try to draw little boxes around.
[03:01:21.100 --> 03:01:23.780]  They say if you're into girls and successful and a jock
[03:01:23.780 --> 03:01:25.740]  and you don't look at books, yeah.
[03:01:25.740 --> 03:01:27.740]  Right, if you're a jock, then you don't read.
[03:01:27.740 --> 03:01:32.900]  If you're a good-looking guy, that means you can't be smart.
[03:01:32.900 --> 03:01:35.860]  And if you're smart, you have to look all disgusting and fat
[03:01:35.860 --> 03:01:38.340]  and like a slob wearing glasses and a pocket protector.
[03:01:38.340 --> 03:01:40.020]  They've created these narratives.
[03:01:40.020 --> 03:01:41.820]  It's forms of segregation.
[03:01:41.820 --> 03:01:45.180]  So for example, I know this very well when my stuff,
[03:01:45.180 --> 03:01:49.900]  after I invented email, never had the copyright,
[03:01:49.900 --> 03:01:52.660]  did all the work, called the email 30 years later when
[03:01:52.660 --> 03:01:54.940]  went into the Smithsonian, who got upset with me?
[03:01:54.940 --> 03:01:56.580]  It was like a new skull was found in Africa.
[03:01:56.580 --> 03:01:59.820]  It was a liberal elite because they could not understand.
[03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:03.060]  It had to come out of their big corporate machine.
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:05.140]  It had to come out of MIT Silicon Valley.
[03:02:05.140 --> 03:02:07.500]  It surely could not come from an American boy,
[03:02:07.500 --> 03:02:09.780]  a 14-year-old kid in Newark, New Jersey.
[03:02:09.780 --> 03:02:12.060]  That bust opened all their freaking narratives
[03:02:12.060 --> 03:02:13.980]  because all their narratives are based on history.
[03:02:13.980 --> 03:02:16.500]  That's the Americana narrative that it comes from the grassroots.
[03:02:16.500 --> 03:02:16.980]  Exactly.
[03:02:16.980 --> 03:02:18.700]  That's the true narrative, right?
[03:02:18.700 --> 03:02:20.220]  The true narrative is a 14-year-old boy
[03:02:20.220 --> 03:02:22.140]  invented TV in Franklin, Idaho.
[03:02:22.140 --> 03:02:23.860]  The true narrative is when you look
[03:02:23.860 --> 03:02:26.020]  at the founders of this country, these guys were plumbers,
[03:02:26.020 --> 03:02:27.860]  and engineers, and architects.
[03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:29.460]  They were people with skills.
[03:02:29.460 --> 03:02:31.860]  And now we have a bunch of morons running the country.
[03:02:31.860 --> 03:02:32.860]  And it was the same thing.
[03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:36.020]  They wouldn't let all those people that were engineers
[03:02:36.020 --> 03:02:40.620]  and explorers, you name it, ever get successful because there
[03:02:40.620 --> 03:02:43.420]  was a British royalty of nobles you had to go through.
[03:02:43.420 --> 03:02:44.620]  And they were so pissed.
[03:02:44.620 --> 03:02:47.620]  That's why they did this was to get out of a caste system.
[03:02:47.620 --> 03:02:48.100]  Exactly.
[03:02:48.100 --> 03:02:52.500]  You look at, even in science, we have fake science right now.
[03:02:52.500 --> 03:02:53.940]  It's pay to play science.
[03:02:53.940 --> 03:02:55.900]  If you're a scientist and you say anything
[03:02:55.900 --> 03:02:58.460]  against Monsanto, your career is destroyed.
[03:02:58.460 --> 03:02:59.260]  I was fortunate.
[03:02:59.260 --> 03:02:59.820]  I made money.
[03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:02.620]  I started my own research institution, did our own research,
[03:03:02.620 --> 03:03:05.820]  and conclusively showed that Monsanto's genetic engineering
[03:03:05.820 --> 03:03:07.980]  is based on no safety assessment standards.
[03:03:07.980 --> 03:03:09.860]  Does any other scientist come and support us?
[03:03:09.860 --> 03:03:12.380]  Very few of them because it's pay to play science.
[03:03:12.380 --> 03:03:14.660]  So we have a neocast system.
[03:03:14.660 --> 03:03:17.540]  And everyone needs to understand that, that these guys,
[03:03:17.540 --> 03:03:19.580]  I was fortunate I infiltrated their system.
[03:03:19.580 --> 03:03:20.580]  Frankly, that's what I did.
[03:03:20.580 --> 03:03:21.500]  I didn't need to go to MIT.
[03:03:21.500 --> 03:03:22.940]  Alex, I already knew engineering.
[03:03:22.940 --> 03:03:24.500]  I wanted to be a carpenter.
[03:03:24.500 --> 03:03:26.540]  And I wanted to do actually design work.
[03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:28.860]  Going to MIT was frankly a sacrifice for me.
[03:03:28.860 --> 03:03:31.180]  I remember the first days when I showed up at the steps
[03:03:31.180 --> 03:03:33.660]  and I saw these people look really, really unhealthy.
[03:03:33.660 --> 03:03:35.580]  And I told my mom, I don't want to go here.
[03:03:35.580 --> 03:03:37.300]  I decided to come there because I wanted
[03:03:37.300 --> 03:03:38.500]  to infiltrate the system.
[03:03:38.500 --> 03:03:41.260]  I got my degrees in a very conscious way, Alex.
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:43.860]  So I could say, one day to them, you know what?
[03:03:43.860 --> 03:03:45.140]  I have the same degrees you do.
[03:03:45.140 --> 03:03:46.820]  It doesn't mean I'm any better, but you
[03:03:46.820 --> 03:03:48.220]  can't challenge me on that.
[03:03:48.220 --> 03:03:51.300]  So I was taking an RTF and it was like,
[03:03:51.300 --> 03:03:53.740]  it was not radio, television, film just from what I knew.
[03:03:53.740 --> 03:03:58.100]  And I said, I'm out of here because exactly it's crazy.
[03:03:58.100 --> 03:04:00.780]  Yeah, so I think what they've, so our platform
[03:04:00.780 --> 03:04:03.060]  is we got to end these predatory student loans.
[03:04:03.060 --> 03:04:06.740]  We got to get young people actually learning skills.
[03:04:06.740 --> 03:04:08.740]  They actually need to work hard.
[03:04:08.740 --> 03:04:11.300]  All those basic ethics that we all
[03:04:11.300 --> 03:04:12.700]  learned that made this country great.
[03:04:12.700 --> 03:04:14.740]  Should we bring back like real apprenticeships
[03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:15.500]  that they'll do?
[03:04:15.500 --> 03:04:16.780]  Real apprenticeships.
[03:04:16.780 --> 03:04:18.340]  That's what I got when I was 14.
[03:04:18.340 --> 03:04:21.060]  This great mentor took me in at Rutgers Medical School.
[03:04:21.060 --> 03:04:21.980]  I learned programming.
[03:04:21.980 --> 03:04:24.020]  I worked with people 40 years older than me.
[03:04:24.020 --> 03:04:25.700]  That's where I got all my education.
[03:04:25.700 --> 03:04:28.380]  Frankly, MIT was where I, they were fortunate to get.
[03:04:28.380 --> 03:04:32.060]  Oh yeah, my dad in high school already at Chemical Plants
[03:04:32.060 --> 03:04:34.340]  and at M.D. Anderson, everywhere in high school
[03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:36.300]  already knew more than when he actually went to UT.
[03:04:36.300 --> 03:04:36.620]  Definitely.
[03:04:36.620 --> 03:04:37.100]  That's crazy.
[03:04:37.100 --> 03:04:38.740]  Hey, Doc, I'm so impressed with you.
[03:04:38.740 --> 03:04:39.860]  Come back very soon.
[03:04:39.860 --> 03:04:41.100]  Thank you so much.
[03:04:41.100 --> 03:04:42.140]  I hope you went to the Senate.
[03:04:42.140 --> 03:04:42.540]  Thanks, Alex.
[03:04:42.540 --> 03:04:43.620]  Be well too.
[03:04:43.620 --> 03:04:44.100]  You're awesome.
[03:04:44.100 --> 03:04:45.060]  Paul Watson's coming up.
[03:04:45.060 --> 03:04:45.780]  Stay with us.
[03:04:45.780 --> 03:04:47.860]  That was a powerful last hour.
[03:04:47.860 --> 03:04:48.860]  Sorry we didn't get to all the callers.
[03:04:48.860 --> 03:04:50.660]  That guy is amazing.
[03:04:50.660 --> 03:04:52.140]  Shiba for senate.com.
[03:04:52.140 --> 03:04:54.220]  I'll show.
[03:04:54.220 --> 03:04:56.660]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product.

[03:05:22.340 --> 03:05:23.820]  and the funguses in the gut.
[03:05:23.820 --> 03:05:25.900]  So this is the time to take advantage
[03:05:25.900 --> 03:05:28.340]  of getting this new incredible fiber product

[03:06:21.780 --> 03:06:26.060]  Paul Watson's taking over the shower, the Vaunted PJW.
[03:06:26.060 --> 03:06:27.740]  And I'm not going to even give attention to the magazine
[03:06:27.740 --> 03:06:29.540]  articles, but they basically stalk Paul
[03:06:29.540 --> 03:06:31.660]  for more than six months in England,
[03:06:31.660 --> 03:06:33.940]  visiting all his old high school friends, everything.
[03:06:33.940 --> 03:06:37.940]  And then they put out this twisted, giant, distorted lie
[03:06:37.940 --> 03:06:40.660]  that if you know the inside baseball, it's hilarious.
[03:06:40.660 --> 03:06:43.380]  But I'm not even going to give it any attention
[03:06:43.380 --> 03:06:47.340]  because it's just unbelievable.
[03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:51.180]  But since people want to know some of the InfowarsLure
[03:06:51.180 --> 03:06:55.300]  on Friday, in the third hour, Paul Watson's joining us.
[03:06:55.300 --> 03:06:59.220]  And we will get into his 15, 16 years now.
[03:06:59.220 --> 03:07:02.260]  Well, since 2002, that's longer than that.
[03:07:02.260 --> 03:07:03.980]  Good Lord.
[03:07:03.980 --> 03:07:05.780]  We're getting old here.
[03:07:05.780 --> 03:07:08.580]  I'm certainly getting old of Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:07:08.580 --> 03:07:10.380]  But I love the article.
[03:07:10.380 --> 03:07:12.460]  Like I've got you in a basement screaming at you
[03:07:12.460 --> 03:07:14.780]  and you're groveling on the ground.
[03:07:14.780 --> 03:07:16.660]  But at the same time, you're paid more than anybody
[03:07:16.660 --> 03:07:19.580]  is in a whole year, a month, that's more BS.
[03:07:19.580 --> 03:07:20.820]  Without giving it any attention,
[03:07:20.820 --> 03:07:21.660]  I know you don't want to give it.
[03:07:21.660 --> 03:07:24.300]  I mean, what was it like when you read that article
[03:07:24.300 --> 03:07:26.660]  just to know they're that obsessed, Paul?
[03:07:27.820 --> 03:07:30.860]  It was hilarious because this guy was like stalking
[03:07:30.860 --> 03:07:33.340]  my friends for weeks beforehand.
[03:07:33.340 --> 03:07:35.980]  As he said, he was going to like remote villages up North
[03:07:35.980 --> 03:07:37.820]  where I lived for a brief time
[03:07:37.820 --> 03:07:39.900]  and trying to knock in on people's doors,
[03:07:39.900 --> 03:07:41.980]  trying to find anyone that knew me.
[03:07:41.980 --> 03:07:44.860]  The only people that did know me said I was all right.
[03:07:44.860 --> 03:07:47.220]  I mean, that was a devastating hit piece.
[03:07:47.220 --> 03:07:48.980]  Let's be clear, you told me like six months ago
[03:07:48.980 --> 03:07:50.140]  they were poking around Sheffield.
[03:07:50.140 --> 03:07:52.620]  So I mean, how long has this been going on?
[03:07:52.620 --> 03:07:54.460]  Well, it's been going on at least two or three months,
[03:07:54.460 --> 03:07:57.780]  but yeah, the two main sources for that article,
[03:07:57.780 --> 03:07:59.740]  which by the way, when they presented it to me,
[03:07:59.740 --> 03:08:02.300]  they were like, oh, this is going to be a neutral profile
[03:08:02.300 --> 03:08:04.300]  piece about how you've risen to prominence.
[03:08:04.300 --> 03:08:06.340]  This is going to be fair and balanced.
[03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:09.220]  The two main sources are your bitter ex-wife
[03:08:09.220 --> 03:08:12.220]  and a disgruntled former employee.
[03:08:12.220 --> 03:08:14.100]  Hardly fair and balanced, is it?
[03:08:14.100 --> 03:08:16.460]  Which is why I don't talk to any of the mainstream media
[03:08:16.460 --> 03:08:17.300]  in the first place.
[03:08:17.300 --> 03:08:20.700]  And that former employee was so jealous of you
[03:08:20.700 --> 03:08:23.500]  that he would shake with anger talking about you.
[03:08:23.500 --> 03:08:26.140]  I mean, it's like the left everything
[03:08:26.140 --> 03:08:29.300]  is like these weird vanity fair, you know,
[03:08:29.300 --> 03:08:30.900]  kindergarten garbage.
[03:08:30.900 --> 03:08:32.140]  It's just unbelievable.
[03:08:33.100 --> 03:08:36.460]  Oh, I love the part that I ordered you to support Trump
[03:08:36.460 --> 03:08:37.500]  or you'd be fired.
[03:08:38.460 --> 03:08:40.580]  You've literally never told me to do anything
[03:08:40.580 --> 03:08:41.860]  in terms of anything like that.
[03:08:41.860 --> 03:08:44.060]  And the bullying and harassment, Alex,
[03:08:44.060 --> 03:08:48.700]  the British accents, I've had PTSD for 15 plus years
[03:08:48.700 --> 03:08:50.980]  because of you impersonating British accents.
[03:08:50.980 --> 03:08:53.340]  I mean, it's traumatic to say the least.
[03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:55.660]  But be honest, be honest with people.
[03:08:55.660 --> 03:08:56.700]  It's not tormenting.
[03:08:56.700 --> 03:09:00.020]  I kind of have a PTSD, a kind of Tourette syndrome.
[03:09:00.020 --> 03:09:00.860]  I wish you would.
[03:09:00.860 --> 03:09:02.420]  I mean, I don't do it a lot, but I mean,
[03:09:02.420 --> 03:09:03.900]  go ahead and do an invitation of Alex Jones
[03:09:03.900 --> 03:09:05.620]  doing a British invitation.
[03:09:05.620 --> 03:09:08.700]  Royalty is kind of on that basis.
[03:09:08.700 --> 03:09:11.820]  But the other thing is he talked to someone
[03:09:11.820 --> 03:09:13.460]  who I gave an interview with previously,
[03:09:13.460 --> 03:09:15.860]  who lives in Sheffield for a student magazine.
[03:09:15.860 --> 03:09:16.980]  And I actually talked to them after
[03:09:16.980 --> 03:09:20.060]  and they completely quoted her out of context.
[03:09:20.060 --> 03:09:22.540]  He was asking her, which he was saying,
[03:09:22.540 --> 03:09:24.900]  oh, are people in Sheffield racist?
[03:09:24.900 --> 03:09:26.220]  And then do they hate Muslims?
[03:09:26.220 --> 03:09:27.660]  And she said, no, nobody's like that.
[03:09:27.660 --> 03:09:30.100]  The vast majority then were not like that.
[03:09:30.100 --> 03:09:32.180]  So when it came to publishing it,
[03:09:32.180 --> 03:09:35.020]  they framed it as asking her about me.
[03:09:35.020 --> 03:09:37.100]  And if people believe what I believe in Sheffield,
[03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:38.380]  then you've got her quote saying,
[03:09:38.380 --> 03:09:39.380]  oh, nobody believes him.
[03:09:39.380 --> 03:09:40.700]  Nobody supports him.
[03:09:40.700 --> 03:09:42.540]  When I get messages every day
[03:09:42.540 --> 03:09:43.860]  from people who live in Sheffield,
[03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:45.340]  including former friends who do,
[03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:48.060]  so they completely twisted this quote from her
[03:09:48.060 --> 03:09:50.140]  to make it look like she was bashing me in attacking.
[03:09:50.140 --> 03:09:52.140]  And what's crazy is the techniques.
[03:09:52.140 --> 03:09:53.780]  She was like, no, that's not what I said.
[03:09:53.780 --> 03:09:56.820]  The techniques of lying though, it's for me a leg.
[03:09:56.820 --> 03:10:00.780]  It's like, Megan Kelly going, oh, you're so handsome.
[03:10:00.780 --> 03:10:02.100]  I want to come, oh, it's a profile
[03:10:02.100 --> 03:10:03.980]  all you've gone through, you poor baby.
[03:10:03.980 --> 03:10:05.820]  I promise it's not about Sandy Hook.
[03:10:05.820 --> 03:10:06.660]  And then she's not even going,
[03:10:06.660 --> 03:10:09.460]  how dare you bring up Sandy Hook to me in the interview?
[03:10:09.460 --> 03:10:10.980]  The heartlessness of him.
[03:10:10.980 --> 03:10:12.900]  Well, I mean, this is what they do.
[03:10:12.900 --> 03:10:14.900]  They, I mean, the reason I didn't talk to them
[03:10:14.900 --> 03:10:16.940]  was because they basically doxxed
[03:10:16.940 --> 03:10:18.780]  and outed Pamela Geller's daughters
[03:10:18.780 --> 03:10:20.420]  who were not political in any way.
[03:10:20.420 --> 03:10:23.140]  Pamela Geller has as a fatwa out against her
[03:10:23.140 --> 03:10:25.620]  and her family from Islamic terrorists.
[03:10:25.620 --> 03:10:27.540]  The Daily Beast thought it was a good idea
[03:10:27.540 --> 03:10:30.860]  to expose her daughters who aren't involved in politics at all,
[03:10:30.860 --> 03:10:33.380]  put them under risk of being assassinated
[03:10:33.380 --> 03:10:34.980]  by Islamic jihadists.
[03:10:34.980 --> 03:10:36.820]  That's the kind of ethics that they go by
[03:10:36.820 --> 03:10:37.860]  over at the Daily Beast.
[03:10:37.860 --> 03:10:39.860]  So that's why I didn't talk to them.
[03:10:39.860 --> 03:10:41.460]  The article was hilarious.
[03:10:41.460 --> 03:10:43.300]  In fact, I'm gonna get some grist out of it
[03:10:43.300 --> 03:10:45.900]  for another hit piece against me by The Daily Show
[03:10:45.900 --> 03:10:50.300]  where they say, oh, I was never interested in punk
[03:10:50.300 --> 03:10:52.820]  and I'm only saying populism is the new punk
[03:10:52.820 --> 03:10:54.180]  for political grist.
[03:10:54.180 --> 03:10:55.700]  Well, in The Daily Beast article,
[03:10:55.700 --> 03:10:58.140]  they literally got quotes from my former schoolmates
[03:10:58.140 --> 03:11:00.500]  who were like, yeah, he was really into the sex pistols
[03:11:00.500 --> 03:11:04.260]  when he was 13, he was copying albums of the sex pistols.
[03:11:04.260 --> 03:11:07.140]  So I'm using one hit piece to debunk another one.
[03:11:07.140 --> 03:11:10.020]  And the picture of me with the crown,
[03:11:10.020 --> 03:11:12.500]  the king of the tards is quite fetching, I think.
[03:11:12.500 --> 03:11:14.900]  So I'm gonna use that as a profile picture at some point.
[03:11:14.900 --> 03:11:16.420]  I'm using it on your Twitter now,
[03:11:16.420 --> 03:11:18.500]  but let's be clear about this.
[03:11:19.580 --> 03:11:22.540]  When you're saying conservatism is the new counterculture,
[03:11:22.540 --> 03:11:25.340]  the new punk rock, it's not even about punk rock
[03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:27.660]  in the statement, you're saying it's the new avant-garde,
[03:11:27.660 --> 03:11:29.660]  the new cutting edge, the renaissance,
[03:11:29.660 --> 03:11:31.660]  which it clearly is, they're the establishment
[03:11:31.660 --> 03:11:32.700]  trying to suppress it.
[03:11:32.700 --> 03:11:34.780]  And that stupid show on Comedy Central
[03:11:34.780 --> 03:11:37.740]  that steals our identities and misrepresentes who we are.
[03:11:37.740 --> 03:11:40.020]  And then, while they live off of our names
[03:11:40.020 --> 03:11:42.740]  and our support, and you call it fame, I guess,
[03:11:42.740 --> 03:11:45.260]  our infamy, then hate us at the same time
[03:11:45.260 --> 03:11:47.140]  like all true parasites do,
[03:11:47.140 --> 03:11:49.220]  they go, oh, the government's run by Republicans
[03:11:49.220 --> 03:11:51.900]  only in a few areas, but that's not the issue.
[03:11:51.900 --> 03:11:53.900]  The whole media, the whole academia,
[03:11:53.900 --> 03:11:57.540]  the whole system is liberal, neoliberal, globalist garbage.
[03:11:57.540 --> 03:12:01.220]  No one can deny that the left are joyless people
[03:12:01.220 --> 03:12:03.100]  that wanna ban cheerleaders and say,
[03:12:03.100 --> 03:12:05.260]  ban the word mother and father officially
[03:12:05.260 --> 03:12:06.620]  by the Canadian government.
[03:12:06.620 --> 03:12:08.500]  You people are in a crazy cult.
[03:12:09.580 --> 03:12:12.460]  And that's why all the messages I get from teenagers
[03:12:12.460 --> 03:12:14.940]  and young kids are saying it's seen as edgy and rebellious.
[03:12:14.940 --> 03:12:16.740]  And also by the way, people in universities
[03:12:16.740 --> 03:12:18.060]  who work there who I speak to,
[03:12:18.060 --> 03:12:20.980]  it's seen as edgy and rebellious to like our content
[03:12:20.980 --> 03:12:22.540]  because it is counterculture.
[03:12:22.540 --> 03:12:25.300]  This daily, this Comedy Central hit piece,
[03:12:25.300 --> 03:12:27.980]  they say, oh, Republicans control these branches
[03:12:27.980 --> 03:12:29.660]  of government, yeah, that's the government,
[03:12:29.660 --> 03:12:31.780]  that's not culture, the culture is Hollywood,
[03:12:31.780 --> 03:12:34.620]  culture is music industry, culture is academia
[03:12:34.620 --> 03:12:35.460]  to a great extent.
[03:12:35.460 --> 03:12:38.340]  Which is a monolithically insane,
[03:12:38.340 --> 03:12:43.100]  globalist, Marxist, anti-family, nihilistic crazy town.
[03:12:44.300 --> 03:12:47.220]  Yeah, and then they imply that I was talking
[03:12:47.220 --> 03:12:49.020]  about the GOP establishment
[03:12:49.020 --> 03:12:50.740]  when I'm talking about the counterculture,
[03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:53.500]  when in the very same video that they play a clip from,
[03:12:53.500 --> 03:12:55.820]  I explicitly say I'm not talking
[03:12:55.820 --> 03:12:59.500]  about Mitch McConnell GOP establishmentism.
[03:12:59.500 --> 03:13:02.460]  And it's in the same video that they quote from.
[03:13:02.460 --> 03:13:05.860]  So the response to that has been a lot of fun to script
[03:13:05.860 --> 03:13:07.740]  because I completely demolished them
[03:13:07.740 --> 03:13:10.180]  and it's probably gonna be out tonight or tomorrow
[03:13:10.180 --> 03:13:11.340]  and it was a lot of fun.
[03:13:11.340 --> 03:13:14.300]  Because they've got like pathetic punk singers
[03:13:14.300 --> 03:13:16.020]  in bands that nobody's ever heard of
[03:13:16.020 --> 03:13:17.900]  trying to define what's punk.
[03:13:17.900 --> 03:13:20.980]  Well, I've got Johnny Rotten from the Sex Pistols
[03:13:20.980 --> 03:13:23.260]  saying Brexit and Trump is punk.
[03:13:23.260 --> 03:13:25.540]  He's quite a higher prominence in the annals of punk history.
[03:13:25.540 --> 03:13:29.460]  And Glenn Danzig is a libertarian conservative
[03:13:29.460 --> 03:13:32.100]  Fox News Watcher and a listener of the show.
[03:13:32.100 --> 03:13:33.300]  He's admitted to that.
[03:13:33.300 --> 03:13:34.620]  I don't know why it doesn't come on,
[03:13:34.620 --> 03:13:37.540]  but the point is Glenn Danzig doesn't like him either.
[03:13:37.540 --> 03:13:38.620]  So he's pretty punk.
[03:13:39.740 --> 03:13:41.820]  Well, yeah, we know Jen Generation Z
[03:13:41.820 --> 03:13:44.140]  is the most conservative since World War II.
[03:13:44.140 --> 03:13:46.340]  My demographic is 18 to 35.
[03:13:46.340 --> 03:13:47.780]  That's the vast majority of it.
[03:13:47.780 --> 03:13:50.620]  Compared to CNN, their average viewer is 60.
[03:13:50.620 --> 03:13:52.820]  I mean, look at people like Jordan Peterson.
[03:13:52.820 --> 03:13:55.020]  Like people like him are the new rock stars.
[03:13:55.020 --> 03:13:57.700]  He packs out literally huge venues
[03:13:57.700 --> 03:14:00.780]  with a message of anti-identity politics.
[03:14:00.780 --> 03:14:02.340]  And yet in this hit piece,
[03:14:02.340 --> 03:14:04.380]  they've got this pathetic punk singer saying,
[03:14:04.380 --> 03:14:06.700]  oh, punk's all about identity politics.
[03:14:06.700 --> 03:14:07.980]  Well, how come the new rock star
[03:14:07.980 --> 03:14:10.780]  is the very antithesis of identity politics?
[03:14:10.780 --> 03:14:12.540]  And they're trying to make it all about punk
[03:14:12.540 --> 03:14:13.820]  when we were just using that
[03:14:13.820 --> 03:14:16.980]  as what was avant-garde in the 70s, not now.
[03:14:17.780 --> 03:14:18.620]  Well, exactly.
[03:14:18.620 --> 03:14:19.900]  And in the 70s, it was the riot
[03:14:19.900 --> 03:14:23.340]  that tried to censor and ban ideas, speech, music and movies.
[03:14:23.340 --> 03:14:24.860]  Who's doing that now, Alex?
[03:14:24.860 --> 03:14:28.700]  Who's literally rioting to shut down controversial ideas?
[03:14:28.700 --> 03:14:30.420]  It's not the riot, that's the left.
[03:14:30.420 --> 03:14:31.900]  They're the new Puritans.
[03:14:31.900 --> 03:14:36.220]  They're the new censorious brigade of thought police,
[03:14:36.220 --> 03:14:37.820]  which is what Kanye West is talking about,
[03:14:37.820 --> 03:14:39.340]  which is why they hate that too.
[03:14:39.340 --> 03:14:40.820]  So they're gonna be completely demolished.
[03:14:40.820 --> 03:14:42.820]  I'm gonna do a rebuttal video.
[03:14:42.820 --> 03:14:44.100]  I'm gonna let you take over.
[03:14:44.100 --> 03:14:46.340]  We're gonna do that hour Friday, but let me ask you this.
[03:14:46.340 --> 03:14:48.020]  What are they gonna do as they realize
[03:14:48.020 --> 03:14:50.100]  they are the most uncool people on earth?
[03:14:50.100 --> 03:14:51.260]  They figured out they're losing power,
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:54.700]  but they are the most uncool last month's garbage
[03:14:54.700 --> 03:14:56.700]  that got forgotten to be taken out
[03:14:56.700 --> 03:14:58.820]  and that their gods are Nancy Pelosi and Hillary.
[03:14:58.820 --> 03:15:00.260]  What are they gonna do when they realize
[03:15:00.260 --> 03:15:01.620]  there's no defeating us?
[03:15:02.620 --> 03:15:03.980]  Well, they're gonna lose drastically.
[03:15:03.980 --> 03:15:06.180]  I mean, that's what's been happening over the two years.
[03:15:06.180 --> 03:15:08.140]  Last two years, Alex.
[03:15:08.140 --> 03:15:11.300]  This is comedy central's owned by Viacom, okay?
[03:15:11.300 --> 03:15:13.740]  This is a giant transnational corporation
[03:15:13.740 --> 03:15:16.900]  owned by a 94-year-old billionaire.
[03:15:16.900 --> 03:15:19.140]  Oh, but they're gonna tell us what punk is.
[03:15:19.140 --> 03:15:21.140]  They're gonna tell us what counter-cultures.
[03:15:21.140 --> 03:15:25.100]  This guy's got more wrinkles than an elephant's behind.
[03:15:25.100 --> 03:15:28.260]  94-year-old billionaire owns your network.
[03:15:28.260 --> 03:15:30.540]  Oh, but you're young and hip and trendy.
[03:15:30.540 --> 03:15:32.380]  Give me a break.
[03:15:32.380 --> 03:15:34.180]  And again, the true awakening
[03:15:34.180 --> 03:15:36.220]  isn't about even being trendy, it's about survival.
[03:15:36.220 --> 03:15:38.940]  And people get old-fashioned, Americana is avant-garde.
[03:15:38.940 --> 03:15:41.140]  So yeah, we went for the old-fashioned big,
[03:15:41.140 --> 03:15:44.220]  you know what, America quote from network.
[03:15:44.220 --> 03:15:45.740]  It's a big, you know what hit.
[03:15:45.740 --> 03:15:48.140]  And that's people, people go, hey, we want that.
[03:15:48.140 --> 03:15:50.540]  We don't want globalism and communism in Venezuela
[03:15:50.540 --> 03:15:52.020]  and eating our dogs.
[03:15:53.380 --> 03:15:55.300]  Healthcare reform is confusing,
[03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:57.500]  but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[03:15:57.500 --> 03:15:59.180]  keeping your doctor or being able
[03:15:59.180 --> 03:16:00.740]  to afford needed prescriptions,
[03:16:00.740 --> 03:16:03.820]  navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.

[03:17:58.500 --> 03:18:01.260]  Digestive enzymes assist in the digestive process
[03:18:01.260 --> 03:18:03.420]  and increase the bioavailability of nutrients
[03:18:03.420 --> 03:18:06.620]  by breaking down foods into easily absorbable components.
[03:18:06.620 --> 03:18:08.700]  They also help prevent discomfort from a digestion
[03:18:08.700 --> 03:18:10.900]  caused by fermentation of undigested food particles
[03:18:10.900 --> 03:18:11.860]  in the gut.
[03:18:11.860 --> 03:18:14.380]  Digestive enzyme production declines as we age.
[03:18:14.380 --> 03:18:16.180]  Carnivore is filled with digestive enzymes
[03:18:16.180 --> 03:18:18.620]  like those naturally present in the body.
[03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:21.740]  Enjoy the full potential of protein rich foods again.

[03:18:25.820 --> 03:18:28.980]  and discomfort commonly associated with high meat diets.
[03:18:28.980 --> 03:18:31.020]  Just one pill with every high protein meal
[03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:32.700]  helps increase the bioavailability

[03:18:34.580 --> 03:18:37.060]  the building blocks to your muscles.
[03:18:37.060 --> 03:18:39.100]  Carnivore also contains digestive enzymes
[03:18:39.100 --> 03:18:41.620]  to help digest fats and carbohydrates.

[03:18:44.260 --> 03:18:45.620]  Don't let a meal go to waste.

[03:18:53.980 --> 03:18:56.380]  We've taken thousands of years of known research
[03:18:56.380 --> 03:18:58.540]  and put it together with our own four years
[03:18:58.540 --> 03:19:01.860]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[03:19:01.860 --> 03:19:03.300]  that God gave us through Mother Nature
[03:19:03.300 --> 03:19:04.580]  to detoxify the body.
[03:19:04.580 --> 03:19:06.620]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield,
[03:19:06.620 --> 03:19:09.500]  Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[03:19:09.500 --> 03:19:10.900]  It's made in the USA.
[03:19:10.900 --> 03:19:13.660]  It's filled with known compounds from nature
[03:19:13.660 --> 03:19:16.460]  that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[03:19:16.460 --> 03:19:17.740]  and it supports the InfoWars.
[03:19:17.740 --> 03:19:19.820]  It is a classical 360 win.
[03:19:19.820 --> 03:19:22.060]  This is the formula that I personally
[03:19:22.060 --> 03:19:23.540]  have been taking for over a year.
[03:19:23.540 --> 03:19:26.700]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection
[03:19:26.700 --> 03:19:29.580]  when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get.
[03:19:29.580 --> 03:19:31.540]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[03:19:31.540 --> 03:19:34.460]  and you owe it to the future of this country and the world
[03:19:34.460 --> 03:19:37.140]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean
[03:19:37.140 --> 03:19:39.100]  and as focused as you can be
[03:19:39.100 --> 03:19:42.020]  because we need you, the remnant of America,
[03:19:42.020 --> 03:19:44.340]  to reignite those brush fires the next level
[03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:46.340]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[03:19:46.340 --> 03:19:48.580]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together,
[03:19:48.580 --> 03:19:49.660]  we're changing the world.
[03:19:49.660 --> 03:19:51.220]  Now it's time to change our bodies
[03:19:51.220 --> 03:19:53.540]  with Z Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[03:19:53.540 --> 03:20:11.340]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:11.340 --> 03:20:14.540]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[03:20:14.540 --> 03:20:17.580]  It is The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:17.580 --> 03:20:24.300]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:20:24.300 --> 03:20:27.100]  You're live in the fourth hour of The Alex Jones Show
[03:20:27.100 --> 03:20:30.020]  on this April 24th edition.
[03:20:30.020 --> 03:20:31.860]  Now I want to get into a bunch of news right now,
[03:20:31.860 --> 03:20:34.340]  particularly what's going on in Europe.
[03:20:34.340 --> 03:20:39.100]  You'll remember New Year's Eve, 2015, going into 2016.
[03:20:39.100 --> 03:20:42.740]  We had the mass molestation of women in Cologne.
[03:20:42.740 --> 03:20:44.940]  By predominantly Muslim migrants,
[03:20:44.940 --> 03:20:48.460]  it went to trial, very few of them actually got convicted.
[03:20:48.460 --> 03:20:50.780]  But the majority, the vast majority of the assaults,
[03:20:50.780 --> 03:20:54.340]  absolute bedlam there in front of the Cologne Cathedral
[03:20:54.340 --> 03:20:56.380]  on New Year's Eve, 2015,
[03:20:56.380 --> 03:20:58.980]  including some women literally pinned down and raped.
[03:20:58.980 --> 03:21:01.220]  This wasn't just fondling or groping.
[03:21:01.220 --> 03:21:03.700]  The vast majority of the culprits were
[03:21:03.700 --> 03:21:05.620]  Muslim migrants and asylum seekers
[03:21:05.620 --> 03:21:07.460]  underscoring this problem that we've had
[03:21:07.460 --> 03:21:10.380]  that has intensified in Europe over the past few years
[03:21:10.380 --> 03:21:12.820]  of women being sexually assaulted.
[03:21:12.820 --> 03:21:14.940]  You look at the polls of women in places
[03:21:14.940 --> 03:21:17.660]  like Sweden, Germany, they're petrified
[03:21:17.660 --> 03:21:21.140]  of going out on the street at night, period.
[03:21:21.140 --> 03:21:22.900]  Now we've also had in attendance,
[03:21:22.900 --> 03:21:25.540]  so this is the situation with Jews.
[03:21:25.540 --> 03:21:27.940]  Day after day, we see stories about attacks,
[03:21:27.940 --> 03:21:30.140]  violent attacks against Jewish people
[03:21:30.140 --> 03:21:31.980]  in major European cities.
[03:21:31.980 --> 03:21:34.100]  A few days ago, there was the video of,
[03:21:34.100 --> 03:21:35.460]  I think it was a Syrian migrant,
[03:21:35.460 --> 03:21:39.580]  literally whipping somebody because they're Jewish.
[03:21:39.580 --> 03:21:42.580]  Now we have this headliner of the Daily Wire,
[03:21:42.580 --> 03:21:44.980]  German Jews warned not to wear yarmulkes
[03:21:44.980 --> 03:21:48.300]  after anti-Semitic attack from Muslim immigrants.
[03:21:48.300 --> 03:21:50.780]  And it talks about Joseph Schuster,
[03:21:50.780 --> 03:21:53.420]  the head of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.
[03:21:53.420 --> 03:21:56.980]  He was told German Jews to avoid wearing yarmulkes
[03:21:56.980 --> 03:22:00.460]  on the streets after an Arab-Israeli was assaulted
[03:22:00.460 --> 03:22:03.860]  for wearing a kippa just days ago in a social experiment.
[03:22:03.860 --> 03:22:06.420]  So you've seen these kinds of social experiments before.
[03:22:06.420 --> 03:22:08.460]  There was a man who walked through Paris
[03:22:08.460 --> 03:22:11.420]  wearing a skull cap, Jewish skull cap.
[03:22:11.420 --> 03:22:16.420]  He was abused verbally repeatedly, mostly by Muslims.
[03:22:17.100 --> 03:22:19.140]  I mean, that was what was shown in the video.
[03:22:19.140 --> 03:22:21.300]  Now I'm comparing this to what happened in Cologne
[03:22:21.300 --> 03:22:23.540]  because of course, after Cologne,
[03:22:23.540 --> 03:22:25.060]  in the days after Cologne,
[03:22:25.060 --> 03:22:27.900]  not only did the feminists come out and protest
[03:22:27.900 --> 03:22:29.580]  in support of the migrants,
[03:22:29.580 --> 03:22:31.940]  but the feminist mayor of Cologne came out
[03:22:31.940 --> 03:22:35.980]  and told women to avoid being sexually assaulted
[03:22:35.980 --> 03:22:38.020]  by traveling in pairs
[03:22:38.020 --> 03:22:41.340]  and by holding the attackers at arm's length.
[03:22:41.340 --> 03:22:43.140]  That was literally the advice
[03:22:43.140 --> 03:22:46.220]  that she gave to women in the city of Cologne
[03:22:46.220 --> 03:22:48.220]  after this mass molestation,
[03:22:48.220 --> 03:22:51.740]  this mass sex crime which occurred on New Year's Eve, 2015.
[03:22:51.740 --> 03:22:53.740]  So now they're doing the same thing.
[03:22:53.740 --> 03:22:56.340]  They're literally telling Jews,
[03:22:56.340 --> 03:22:58.140]  forget about the underlying causes,
[03:22:58.140 --> 03:23:00.380]  the root causes of why these attacks are happening.
[03:23:00.380 --> 03:23:02.860]  The solution is for you to cover up.
[03:23:02.860 --> 03:23:05.140]  They're literally telling Jews to cover up
[03:23:05.140 --> 03:23:09.380]  to wear baseball caps to hide the fact that they're Jews,
[03:23:09.380 --> 03:23:12.220]  like a reverse of the star or something.
[03:23:12.220 --> 03:23:13.900]  Instead of identifying as Jews,
[03:23:13.900 --> 03:23:16.140]  now they have to hide the fact that they're Jews
[03:23:16.140 --> 03:23:18.300]  to prevent these attacks.
[03:23:18.300 --> 03:23:21.300]  So the question isn't, why are these attacks happening?
[03:23:21.300 --> 03:23:23.260]  Are we importing a group of people
[03:23:23.260 --> 03:23:25.580]  who are intolerant of other religions
[03:23:25.580 --> 03:23:27.220]  of women who aren't covered up?
[03:23:27.220 --> 03:23:30.260]  No, we have to change our behavior
[03:23:30.260 --> 03:23:31.860]  to associate this problem.
[03:23:31.860 --> 03:23:34.740]  Absolutely incredible, the article continues.
[03:23:34.740 --> 03:23:37.260]  The suspect beat the Arab-Israeli with his bell
[03:23:37.260 --> 03:23:39.340]  and I think we played the clip a couple of days ago,
[03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:42.820]  while shouting Yehudi, which is Jew in Arabic.
[03:23:42.820 --> 03:23:45.740]  The suspect in the assault is a 19-year-old Syrian refugee
[03:23:45.740 --> 03:23:47.780]  of Palestinian origin.
[03:23:47.780 --> 03:23:50.140]  Schuster, this is the head of the Central Council
[03:23:50.140 --> 03:23:51.380]  of Jews in Germany,
[03:23:51.380 --> 03:23:53.140]  explained that people should stop, quote,
[03:23:53.140 --> 03:23:55.740]  showing themselves openly with a kipper
[03:23:55.740 --> 03:23:57.860]  in a big city setting in Germany
[03:23:57.860 --> 03:24:00.260]  and wear a baseball cap or something else
[03:24:00.260 --> 03:24:02.780]  to cover their head instead.
[03:24:02.780 --> 03:24:05.540]  Literally saying that they need to cover up
[03:24:05.540 --> 03:24:07.860]  to protect themselves from being attacked.
[03:24:07.860 --> 03:24:11.540]  Not saying how about we focus on rooting out the attackers
[03:24:11.540 --> 03:24:14.580]  and asking why these attacks are increasing.
[03:24:14.580 --> 03:24:16.180]  I mean, look at Paris, look at France.
[03:24:16.180 --> 03:24:20.340]  You've had a massive migration of Jews leaving Paris,
[03:24:20.340 --> 03:24:23.380]  leaving France partly, if not wholly,
[03:24:23.380 --> 03:24:25.460]  because of these very kind of attacks.
[03:24:25.460 --> 03:24:27.780]  This is a situation we face in Europe
[03:24:27.780 --> 03:24:31.660]  and it's time to have an upfront honest conversation about it.
[03:24:31.660 --> 03:24:33.620]  Article continues, this is daily wire.
[03:24:33.620 --> 03:24:35.860]  German Jews warned not to wear yarmulkes
[03:24:35.860 --> 03:24:38.660]  after anti-Semitic attack.
[03:24:38.660 --> 03:24:40.340]  Schuster suggested three years ago
[03:24:40.340 --> 03:24:42.300]  that Jews shouldn't wear skull caps in areas
[03:24:42.300 --> 03:24:43.980]  with large Muslim populations.
[03:24:43.980 --> 03:24:46.260]  So this has been going on for three years.
[03:24:46.260 --> 03:24:48.860]  But he stressed there's increasing anti-Semitic sentiment
[03:24:48.860 --> 03:24:51.140]  among non-migrants.
[03:24:51.140 --> 03:24:52.900]  The rise of anti-Semitic attacks throughout Europe
[03:24:52.900 --> 03:24:55.820]  is in line with a massive increase in Muslim immigration,
[03:24:55.820 --> 03:24:57.940]  some kind of connection there.
[03:24:57.940 --> 03:24:59.500]  It's been obvious for years.
[03:24:59.500 --> 03:25:01.460]  According to a June 2017 study
[03:25:01.460 --> 03:25:04.700]  from Johann du Est and of the University of Oslo,
[03:25:04.700 --> 03:25:06.780]  available data on perpetrators suggest
[03:25:06.780 --> 03:25:08.340]  that individuals of Muslim backgrounds
[03:25:08.340 --> 03:25:12.100]  stand out among perpetrators of anti-Semitic violence
[03:25:12.100 --> 03:25:13.580]  in Western Europe.
[03:25:13.580 --> 03:25:15.780]  Attitude surveys corroborate this picture
[03:25:15.780 --> 03:25:17.660]  insofar as anti-Semitic attitudes
[03:25:17.660 --> 03:25:19.940]  are far more widespread among Muslims
[03:25:19.940 --> 03:25:23.060]  than among the general population in Western Europe.
[03:25:23.060 --> 03:25:26.980]  So in America and in Europe to a great extent too,
[03:25:26.980 --> 03:25:30.380]  with these generation identity groups and others,
[03:25:30.380 --> 03:25:32.660]  we've got this massive moral panic,
[03:25:32.660 --> 03:25:34.900]  this hysteria over neo-Nazis
[03:25:34.900 --> 03:25:38.860]  who are comparatively tiny, tiny in number,
[03:25:38.860 --> 03:25:41.060]  when in fact the true intolerance being displayed
[03:25:41.060 --> 03:25:44.660]  towards Jews and in some cases in a very violent manner
[03:25:44.660 --> 03:25:47.460]  is coming from a very different group.
[03:25:48.300 --> 03:25:49.300]  The article continues,
[03:25:49.300 --> 03:25:51.180]  this is one of those politically incorrect facts
[03:25:51.180 --> 03:25:52.340]  that gets ignored so often
[03:25:52.340 --> 03:25:55.740]  in the European left's desire to speak glowingly
[03:25:55.740 --> 03:25:58.660]  of diversity thanks to mass immigration from the Middle East,
[03:25:58.660 --> 03:26:01.820]  the selection of Muslim populations over Jewish ones.
[03:26:01.820 --> 03:26:03.980]  The city of Malmo, Sweden, listen to this,
[03:26:03.980 --> 03:26:06.540]  has become essentially a no-go zone for Jews,
[03:26:06.540 --> 03:26:09.060]  as Paul Inuding wrote in The New York Times,
[03:26:09.060 --> 03:26:12.900]  that famous right-wing publication last year.
[03:26:12.900 --> 03:26:14.500]  So this is a quote from The New York Times
[03:26:14.500 --> 03:26:16.380]  about what's happening in Sweden.
[03:26:16.380 --> 03:26:18.140]  And I didn't even know some of these details,
[03:26:18.140 --> 03:26:21.100]  given I'm made like what, four or five videos on Sweden,
[03:26:21.100 --> 03:26:23.860]  talk about it endlessly, it's my favorite country.
[03:26:23.860 --> 03:26:26.020]  This is from The New York Times.
[03:26:26.020 --> 03:26:28.540]  Today entering a synagogue anywhere in Sweden
[03:26:28.540 --> 03:26:31.180]  usually requires going through security checks,
[03:26:31.180 --> 03:26:34.180]  including airport-like questioning.
[03:26:34.180 --> 03:26:35.740]  At times of high alert police officers
[03:26:35.740 --> 03:26:37.900]  with machine guns guard Jewish schools.
[03:26:37.900 --> 03:26:41.180]  Now listen to this, children at the Jewish kindergarten
[03:26:41.180 --> 03:26:46.180]  in Malmo play behind bulletproof glass.
[03:26:46.460 --> 03:26:48.940]  Imagine that, the threat is so severe,
[03:26:48.940 --> 03:26:53.860]  they have to have the children in kindergarten protected,
[03:26:53.860 --> 03:26:55.980]  shielded behind bulletproof glass
[03:26:55.980 --> 03:26:58.740]  because they fear they'll be massacred.
[03:26:58.740 --> 03:27:02.380]  That's in Malmo, Sweden continues,
[03:27:02.380 --> 03:27:05.340]  not even funerals are safe from harassment.
[03:27:05.340 --> 03:27:07.260]  A spokesman for Malmo's Jewish community
[03:27:07.260 --> 03:27:08.980]  put the situation starkly,
[03:27:08.980 --> 03:27:12.140]  you don't want to display the star of David around your neck.
[03:27:12.140 --> 03:27:14.740]  Or as a spokesman from the Gothenburg synagogue put it,
[03:27:14.740 --> 03:27:16.620]  it's a constant battle to live a normal life
[03:27:16.620 --> 03:27:18.260]  and not to give in to the threats,
[03:27:18.260 --> 03:27:20.700]  but still be able to feel safe.
[03:27:21.580 --> 03:27:25.620]  This is Sweden and now Germany is becoming like Sweden
[03:27:25.620 --> 03:27:28.900]  just by coincidence as they import millions more migrants
[03:27:28.900 --> 03:27:32.260]  from a certain part of the world, just a coincidence.
[03:27:32.260 --> 03:27:36.220]  Fully 51% of all anti-Semitic attacks in Sweden
[03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:39.220]  were perpetrated by Muslims, these are official figures,
[03:27:39.220 --> 03:27:43.100]  as opposed to 5% perpetuated by right wing extremists
[03:27:43.100 --> 03:27:47.700]  and 25% perpetrated by left wing extremists.
[03:27:47.700 --> 03:27:50.420]  So we've got a whole moral panic,
[03:27:50.420 --> 03:27:53.980]  the hysteria of the rise of the far right in Europe
[03:27:53.980 --> 03:27:57.860]  and in America, 5% of these anti-Semitic attacks,
[03:27:57.860 --> 03:27:59.620]  and of course they're all horrific
[03:27:59.620 --> 03:28:02.420]  and we condemn them every single one of them,
[03:28:02.420 --> 03:28:06.260]  but only 5% are perpetrated by right wing extremists,
[03:28:06.260 --> 03:28:09.100]  five times that number are perpetrated
[03:28:09.100 --> 03:28:10.700]  by left wing extremists
[03:28:10.700 --> 03:28:14.300]  and the majority are perpetrated by Muslims,
[03:28:14.300 --> 03:28:16.540]  despite the fact that Muslims represent,
[03:28:16.540 --> 03:28:19.620]  what is it, like 7% of the population in Sweden now,
[03:28:19.620 --> 03:28:21.180]  it's probably more at this point.
[03:28:21.180 --> 03:28:22.900]  The article continues,
[03:28:22.900 --> 03:28:25.100]  the European press are determined to ignore this problem
[03:28:25.100 --> 03:28:26.380]  even as it grows radically,
[03:28:26.380 --> 03:28:29.700]  even as elderly Holocaust survivors are thrown from windows
[03:28:29.700 --> 03:28:31.100]  or stabbed to death,
[03:28:31.100 --> 03:28:33.500]  even as Jewish supermarkets are targeted,
[03:28:33.500 --> 03:28:35.940]  and where are the big Jewish organisations
[03:28:35.940 --> 03:28:39.380]  identifying the true source of this problem?
[03:28:39.380 --> 03:28:41.700]  They're almost silent.
[03:28:41.700 --> 03:28:43.540]  Massive problem in Europe right now
[03:28:43.540 --> 03:28:45.260]  with the attacks against Jewish people,
[03:28:45.260 --> 03:28:46.380]  and it's only going to get worse
[03:28:46.380 --> 03:28:48.620]  if we don't identify the root causes.
[03:28:48.620 --> 03:28:50.540]  We'll be back, don't go away.
[03:28:50.540 --> 03:28:51.380]  Don't go away.
[03:29:20.540 --> 03:29:25.020]  Healthcare reform is confusing,
[03:29:25.020 --> 03:29:27.220]  but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,
[03:29:27.220 --> 03:29:28.340]  keeping your doctor
[03:29:28.340 --> 03:29:30.460]  or being able to afford needed prescriptions,
[03:29:30.460 --> 03:29:33.540]  navigating the healthcare system has become a challenge.
[03:29:33.540 --> 03:29:35.220]  Control your own healthcare costs
[03:29:35.220 --> 03:29:37.260]  and choices with Liberty Health Share.
[03:29:37.260 --> 03:29:39.140]  Liberty Health Share is not insurance,
[03:29:39.140 --> 03:29:41.420]  it is an association of self-paid patients
[03:29:41.420 --> 03:29:42.860]  who unite with like-minded people
[03:29:42.860 --> 03:29:45.260]  to share the cost of each other's medical needs,
[03:29:45.260 --> 03:29:46.780]  neighbour helping neighbour.

[03:30:00.820 --> 03:30:03.260]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:30:03.260 --> 03:30:04.460]  It's stronger.

[03:30:10.380 --> 03:30:13.580]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:30:13.580 --> 03:30:14.780]  It's got the preglonone,
[03:30:14.780 --> 03:30:17.420]  that's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body,
[03:30:17.420 --> 03:30:19.460]  then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins,
[03:30:19.460 --> 03:30:21.420]  the amino acids, so you can upload it.

[03:30:27.500 --> 03:30:30.580]  is super blue silver immune gargle,
[03:30:30.580 --> 03:30:32.780]  that's a spray you do, you can also swallow it.
[03:30:32.780 --> 03:30:35.460]  It's a supplement with iodine,
[03:30:35.460 --> 03:30:38.100]  super high quality silver and a lot more.
[03:30:38.100 --> 03:30:39.540]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[03:30:39.540 --> 03:30:41.500]  So thank you all for remembering,

[03:30:43.740 --> 03:30:46.060]  that it's not just you that's already awake,
[03:30:46.060 --> 03:30:47.700]  but it's other people that aren't awake
[03:30:47.700 --> 03:30:49.460]  and it's so essential to spread the word.
[03:30:49.460 --> 03:30:51.100]  Again, thank you so much for being part
[03:30:51.100 --> 03:30:52.740]  of the Second American Revolution.
[03:30:55.180 --> 03:30:58.500]  Alex Jones here with an extremely exciting announcement
[03:30:58.500 --> 03:31:01.540]  that will be a gift to yourself and a gift to the info war
[03:31:01.540 --> 03:31:03.660]  to fight the globalist and limited free society.
[03:31:03.660 --> 03:31:07.260]  Several years ago, I set out with top formulators in the US
[03:31:07.260 --> 03:31:10.420]  to create the strongest, most concentrated,
[03:31:10.420 --> 03:31:15.420]  over the top stamina, libido, workout, brain formula
[03:31:15.420 --> 03:31:16.580]  that is safe.
[03:31:16.580 --> 03:31:19.500]  I know from using this myself the last few months
[03:31:19.500 --> 03:31:21.220]  and from seeing my friends and family use it,

[03:31:53.660 --> 03:31:57.060]  Introducing Cell Force by Info Wars Life.
[03:31:57.060 --> 03:32:00.020]  Cell Force focuses on mitochondria efficiency
[03:32:00.020 --> 03:32:01.060]  and protection.
[03:32:01.060 --> 03:32:04.420]  Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[03:32:04.420 --> 03:32:06.900]  They are your body's cellular engines.
[03:32:06.900 --> 03:32:09.980]  Cell Force helps promote your cellular energy production
[03:32:09.980 --> 03:32:11.620]  by supporting mitochondria,
[03:32:11.620 --> 03:32:14.020]  much like a cellular engine overhaul
[03:32:14.020 --> 03:32:15.980]  because when your mitochondria don't run
[03:32:15.980 --> 03:32:17.780]  at 100% efficiency,
[03:32:17.780 --> 03:32:21.060]  then they start producing reactive oxygen species.
[03:32:21.060 --> 03:32:24.300]  Top scientists agree that aging is most likely caused
[03:32:24.300 --> 03:32:25.780]  by cellular damage,
[03:32:25.780 --> 03:32:29.260]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[03:32:29.260 --> 03:32:31.500]  The antioxidants found in Cell Force
[03:32:31.500 --> 03:32:34.340]  are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[03:32:34.340 --> 03:32:36.020]  The stronger the antioxidant,
[03:32:36.020 --> 03:32:37.860]  the better its ability to scavenge
[03:32:37.860 --> 03:32:41.980]  for these reactive oxygen species and other free radicals.
[03:32:41.980 --> 03:32:45.140]  Boost, protect, and adapt with Cell Force
[03:32:45.140 --> 03:32:46.860]  from Info Wars Life.
[03:32:46.860 --> 03:32:51.860]  Head to infowarslife.com or call 1-888-253-3139.
[03:32:57.180 --> 03:33:00.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:07.500 --> 03:33:11.380]  Live from the infowars.com studios,
[03:33:11.380 --> 03:33:14.460]  you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:14.460 --> 03:33:18.340]  And now, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:18.340 --> 03:33:21.380]  Won't you buy some more?
[03:33:21.380 --> 03:33:23.740]  Go back, let's do the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:23.740 --> 03:33:25.980]  We were talking about a situation in Europe.
[03:33:25.980 --> 03:33:27.260]  And you know what's a shame about this,
[03:33:27.260 --> 03:33:28.820]  is that there are groups of migrants
[03:33:28.820 --> 03:33:31.180]  who do integrate into European countries.
[03:33:31.180 --> 03:33:34.420]  And in many cases, those groups are treated more harshly
[03:33:34.420 --> 03:33:36.260]  than the ones causing the problems.
[03:33:36.260 --> 03:33:39.780]  We saw this with the whole Windrush controversy in the UK,
[03:33:39.780 --> 03:33:42.500]  with the Caribbean migrants being mistreated,
[03:33:42.500 --> 03:33:44.860]  being deported in some cases,
[03:33:44.860 --> 03:33:46.500]  when they had a right to remain.
[03:33:46.500 --> 03:33:50.220]  We've seen hardworking business-owning Syrian migrants
[03:33:50.220 --> 03:33:52.140]  in Sweden being punished by the government
[03:33:52.140 --> 03:33:53.820]  because they missed some technicality
[03:33:53.820 --> 03:33:55.700]  on their immigration visa.
[03:33:55.700 --> 03:33:59.100]  Meanwhile, they let in ISIS jihadists back into the country,
[03:33:59.100 --> 03:34:00.900]  giving them welfare,
[03:34:00.900 --> 03:34:04.020]  and treating the migrants who caused the problems
[03:34:04.020 --> 03:34:04.860]  with kids' gloves.
[03:34:04.860 --> 03:34:07.740]  And this is a situation that's arisen in Sweden once again
[03:34:07.740 --> 03:34:09.340]  with this story.
[03:34:09.340 --> 03:34:11.780]  Swedish woman who accompanied two Afghans to prove
[03:34:11.780 --> 03:34:14.460]  that xenophobes are wrong,
[03:34:14.460 --> 03:34:17.940]  dark humor there, is raped and abused.
[03:34:17.940 --> 03:34:20.140]  So the middle-aged Swedish woman was raped and abused
[03:34:20.140 --> 03:34:23.780]  by two Afghan asylum seekers in their asylum accommodation.
[03:34:23.780 --> 03:34:26.500]  The woman who was a member of a Facebook group
[03:34:26.500 --> 03:34:28.820]  against migrant deportation,
[03:34:28.820 --> 03:34:32.220]  so this was a pro-refugee campaigner,
[03:34:32.220 --> 03:34:34.180]  tried to prove that xenophobes are wrong
[03:34:34.180 --> 03:34:36.420]  about the fact that Afghans are dangerous.
[03:34:36.420 --> 03:34:38.820]  This is how she tried to prove it.
[03:34:38.820 --> 03:34:40.900]  She wanted to meet someone during a night out,
[03:34:40.900 --> 03:34:42.100]  and when she was unsuccessful,
[03:34:42.100 --> 03:34:45.300]  decided to go home to the migrant center
[03:34:45.300 --> 03:34:47.940]  with two Afghan men.
[03:34:47.940 --> 03:34:49.860]  Yeah, not a great decision there.
[03:34:49.860 --> 03:34:51.940]  She met the two unaccompanied refugees
[03:34:51.940 --> 03:34:54.340]  from Afghanistan outside a pub
[03:34:54.340 --> 03:34:55.740]  and decided to accompany them back
[03:34:55.740 --> 03:34:58.300]  to their asylum center in Lungby.
[03:34:58.300 --> 03:35:01.780]  The woman, who again is a member of an anti-deportation group,
[03:35:01.780 --> 03:35:02.620]  told police, quote,
[03:35:02.620 --> 03:35:04.340]  I've never been afraid or worried about people
[03:35:04.340 --> 03:35:05.620]  from other countries,
[03:35:05.620 --> 03:35:08.260]  and I thought it was quite interesting to talk with them.
[03:35:08.260 --> 03:35:11.500]  Well, talk with them, don't go home with them.
[03:35:11.500 --> 03:35:13.380]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:35:13.380 --> 03:35:15.700]  So again, she made this decision
[03:35:15.700 --> 03:35:20.300]  based on her own misleading virtue signalling lifestyle.
[03:35:20.300 --> 03:35:21.860]  This is a woman who's pro-refugee.
[03:35:21.860 --> 03:35:23.540]  She probably gone out and campaigned
[03:35:23.540 --> 03:35:26.220]  with those refugee welcome signs.
[03:35:26.220 --> 03:35:28.300]  She's gone home with two Afghan men
[03:35:28.300 --> 03:35:30.020]  and thought that wouldn't be a problem
[03:35:30.020 --> 03:35:31.900]  because the xenophobes must be wrong,
[03:35:31.900 --> 03:35:34.140]  and I'm gonna prove them wrong.
[03:35:34.140 --> 03:35:35.340]  When they arrived at the men's room
[03:35:35.340 --> 03:35:37.500]  in the asylum accommodation,
[03:35:37.500 --> 03:35:39.540]  things changed rapidly, they drank alcohol,
[03:35:39.540 --> 03:35:40.860]  and one of the men started touching her,
[03:35:40.860 --> 03:35:42.460]  even though she told him she didn't want him to
[03:35:42.460 --> 03:35:44.180]  and against her repeated protests.
[03:35:45.420 --> 03:35:47.460]  Again, Afghanistan is a country
[03:35:47.460 --> 03:35:50.100]  where they literally have something called Bacha Bazi,
[03:35:50.100 --> 03:35:52.660]  where old men get to have sex with children
[03:35:52.660 --> 03:35:54.940]  and it's just part of their culture.
[03:35:54.940 --> 03:35:55.780]  Google it.
[03:35:55.780 --> 03:35:56.980]  You don't believe me, Google it.
[03:35:56.980 --> 03:35:59.860]  The U.S. Army tried to blow the whistle on it.
[03:35:59.860 --> 03:36:01.380]  Some members of the U.S. military,
[03:36:01.380 --> 03:36:02.940]  they were told to shut up.
[03:36:02.940 --> 03:36:04.460]  That was in the New York Times.
[03:36:04.460 --> 03:36:06.180]  Some cultures are better than others,
[03:36:06.180 --> 03:36:09.020]  but no, let's just go home with them alone.
[03:36:09.020 --> 03:36:12.500]  Later, one of the men called Anwar raped her vaginally
[03:36:12.500 --> 03:36:14.420]  and aimily while the other masturbated next to her.
[03:36:14.420 --> 03:36:16.620]  It was a very painful experience.
[03:36:16.620 --> 03:36:19.100]  After getting away, the woman called the police
[03:36:19.100 --> 03:36:21.620]  and listened to what happened to the perpetrators.
[03:36:21.620 --> 03:36:24.380]  Anwar, the lead culprit, was convicted of rape.
[03:36:24.380 --> 03:36:27.780]  His sentence was one year and three months in prison.
[03:36:28.820 --> 03:36:33.820]  15 months in prison for this obscene, disgusting rape,
[03:36:33.900 --> 03:36:36.100]  and he's not gonna be deported.
[03:36:36.100 --> 03:36:39.220]  He'll pay 13,000 euros in damages to the woman.
[03:36:39.220 --> 03:36:41.060]  Fardin, who was the other culprit,
[03:36:41.060 --> 03:36:42.340]  is sentenced for sexual abuse.
[03:36:42.340 --> 03:36:46.100]  He will pay 2,300 euros in damages to the victim.
[03:36:46.100 --> 03:36:49.660]  Prosecutor never asked for Fardin to be expelled.
[03:36:49.660 --> 03:36:50.860]  So one of them, literally,
[03:36:50.860 --> 03:36:52.580]  it doesn't say if he's got any prison time,
[03:36:52.580 --> 03:36:56.700]  but it says it's a 2,300 euro fine for raping a woman.
[03:36:56.700 --> 03:36:59.460]  Absolutely insane.
[03:36:59.460 --> 03:37:01.060]  This is Sweden.
[03:37:01.060 --> 03:37:02.300]  What do you expect?
[03:37:03.380 --> 03:37:04.900]  Another headline here out of Breitbart,
[03:37:04.900 --> 03:37:06.820]  one in three North Africans want to migrate
[03:37:06.820 --> 03:37:08.060]  permanently, number rising.
[03:37:08.060 --> 03:37:11.140]  Now, remember last week we talked about President Macron,
[03:37:11.140 --> 03:37:13.820]  who is visiting with Trump today, obviously,
[03:37:13.820 --> 03:37:15.780]  talking about the overall plan,
[03:37:15.780 --> 03:37:18.940]  the ultimate plan for Arabia,
[03:37:18.940 --> 03:37:23.340]  which is to invite in 200 million Africans.
[03:37:23.340 --> 03:37:25.500]  Now, if you invite Africa into Europe,
[03:37:25.500 --> 03:37:26.580]  guess what happens?
[03:37:26.580 --> 03:37:28.980]  Europe becomes Africa.
[03:37:28.980 --> 03:37:30.820]  The proportion of North Africans who want
[03:37:30.820 --> 03:37:33.780]  to permanently migrate has reached a record high,
[03:37:33.780 --> 03:37:35.940]  with almost half of young people wanting to move country
[03:37:35.940 --> 03:37:37.700]  if they get a chance.
[03:37:37.700 --> 03:37:38.460]  No surprise.
[03:37:38.460 --> 03:37:40.140]  I mean, if I lived in some of these countries,
[03:37:40.140 --> 03:37:41.460]  I would want to leave them,
[03:37:41.460 --> 03:37:43.900]  but that doesn't mean you can just invite them all in
[03:37:43.900 --> 03:37:45.860]  without any consequences.
[03:37:45.860 --> 03:37:49.660]  Just under one in three, 32% of 5,000 North African
[03:37:49.660 --> 03:37:52.500]  respondents to the Gallup World Pulse 2017
[03:37:52.500 --> 03:37:54.500]  said they would like to move abroad,
[03:37:54.500 --> 03:37:57.460]  a figure up from 28% the previous year.
[03:37:58.660 --> 03:38:00.540]  The desire to migrate was found to be strongest
[03:38:00.540 --> 03:38:02.660]  among younger North Africans,
[03:38:02.660 --> 03:38:05.540]  with a proportion of 15 to 29-year-olds jumping
[03:38:05.540 --> 03:38:09.660]  from 40% in 2016 to 46% the following year.
[03:38:09.660 --> 03:38:11.580]  And that is, of course, because Europe has,
[03:38:11.580 --> 03:38:15.100]  to a great extent, rolled out the red carpet.
[03:38:15.100 --> 03:38:19.540]  Almost a third, 30% of people in the 30 to 49 age bracket
[03:38:19.540 --> 03:38:21.780]  said they would like to permanently migrate,
[03:38:21.780 --> 03:38:24.900]  rising from 24% of those interviewed in 2016,
[03:38:24.900 --> 03:38:28.380]  which surveyed people living in Algeria, Egypt, Libya,
[03:38:28.380 --> 03:38:31.260]  where they literally have the street slave markets,
[03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:33.420]  Morocco, and Tunisia.
[03:38:34.340 --> 03:38:36.620]  The most desired destination for North Africans
[03:38:36.620 --> 03:38:38.380]  who said they would like to migrate permanently
[03:38:38.380 --> 03:38:42.100]  was France, which is a bountiful,
[03:38:42.100 --> 03:38:45.180]  joyous, pleasant land of cultural enrichment right now,
[03:38:45.180 --> 03:38:47.340]  with the number who named the EU country rising
[03:38:47.340 --> 03:38:50.780]  to 19% from 13% the previous year.
[03:38:50.780 --> 03:38:53.140]  And of course now, Macron is saying,
[03:38:53.140 --> 03:38:55.180]  come on in, 200 million Africans,
[03:38:55.180 --> 03:38:56.660]  what could possibly go wrong?
[03:38:58.100 --> 03:38:59.260]  Also out of Breitbart,
[03:38:59.260 --> 03:39:01.500]  EU to cut funds to patriotic nations,
[03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:03.500]  allocate cash on values basis,
[03:39:03.500 --> 03:39:05.780]  including accepting mass migration.
[03:39:05.780 --> 03:39:08.500]  So again, we've had the busy grab countries,
[03:39:08.500 --> 03:39:11.540]  Hungary, Poland, Austria, to some extent,
[03:39:11.540 --> 03:39:14.140]  rebelling against EU migrant quotas.
[03:39:14.140 --> 03:39:16.140]  They don't want migrants settled in their country,
[03:39:16.140 --> 03:39:18.260]  and now they're gonna be punished
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:21.300]  by the Democratic Freedom Loving European Union.
[03:39:21.300 --> 03:39:23.980]  Remember, Macron literally said that
[03:39:23.980 --> 03:39:27.740]  Hungary was the authoritarian system and not the EU.
[03:39:27.740 --> 03:39:31.980]  They literally ignore the results of referendums and votes.
[03:39:31.980 --> 03:39:34.860]  That sounds pretty authoritarian to me.
[03:39:34.860 --> 03:39:38.380]  Says Brussels is set to divert tens of billions of euros
[03:39:38.380 --> 03:39:42.140]  in EU cash away from patriotic Eastern and Central States
[03:39:42.140 --> 03:39:43.420]  under budget reform plans
[03:39:43.420 --> 03:39:45.260]  that would link funding to the blocs.
[03:39:45.260 --> 03:39:49.100]  Values, which include mass migration.
[03:39:49.100 --> 03:39:51.420]  According to proposals seen by the FT,
[03:39:51.420 --> 03:39:53.900]  the European Commission is planning to shift the criteria
[03:39:53.900 --> 03:39:56.580]  for distributing cohesion program funds
[03:39:56.580 --> 03:40:00.100]  away from GDP per capita towards so-called EU values,
[03:40:01.020 --> 03:40:04.220]  which means the 350 billion euro funding part
[03:40:04.220 --> 03:40:06.660]  aimed at developing the bloc's weaker economies in the bloc
[03:40:06.660 --> 03:40:10.380]  appears under a new title of cohesion and values.
[03:40:10.380 --> 03:40:12.300]  So it's gonna shift to a system in which
[03:40:12.300 --> 03:40:13.900]  the allocation of funds would be based on
[03:40:13.900 --> 03:40:15.940]  much broader criteria,
[03:40:15.940 --> 03:40:17.740]  including migration, environmental policy,
[03:40:17.740 --> 03:40:19.340]  and youth unemployment.
[03:40:19.340 --> 03:40:21.260]  So they're gonna take away the money
[03:40:21.260 --> 03:40:24.460]  from those Eastern European countries as a punishment
[03:40:24.460 --> 03:40:26.140]  because they don't want their culture
[03:40:26.140 --> 03:40:28.620]  to be subsumed by another culture,
[03:40:28.620 --> 03:40:30.380]  and they're gonna give it to the countries
[03:40:30.380 --> 03:40:32.020]  that are obeying.
[03:40:32.020 --> 03:40:36.020]  Again, another authoritarian facet of the European Union
[03:40:36.020 --> 03:40:38.100]  coming to the fore once again.
[03:40:39.180 --> 03:40:42.820]  Continues top Brussels figures have repeatedly insisted
[03:40:42.820 --> 03:40:45.100]  that importing huge numbers of third world migrants
[03:40:45.100 --> 03:40:48.900]  must be a core feature of belonging to the bloc.
[03:40:48.900 --> 03:40:49.740]  You remember in Germany,
[03:40:49.740 --> 03:40:53.220]  we had the clip of the Green Party leader,
[03:40:53.220 --> 03:40:55.620]  I think Stephanie von Berger's a name,
[03:40:55.620 --> 03:40:57.940]  getting up in front of parliament and openly bragging
[03:40:57.940 --> 03:41:02.420]  that Germans will be a minority in major cities by 2020
[03:41:02.420 --> 03:41:04.260]  and saying that that's a good thing,
[03:41:04.260 --> 03:41:05.740]  that was literally her quote.
[03:41:06.620 --> 03:41:08.980]  We've got Sweden where ethnic Swedes
[03:41:08.980 --> 03:41:12.420]  will be a minority in their country within our lifetimes,
[03:41:12.420 --> 03:41:15.940]  not just in the major cities, but the country as a whole.
[03:41:15.940 --> 03:41:19.980]  And Germany by 2060 or before,
[03:41:19.980 --> 03:41:23.140]  Germans will be a minority in Germany.
[03:41:23.140 --> 03:41:27.340]  You get to that stage and it's no longer Germany, okay?
[03:41:27.340 --> 03:41:30.220]  The people make the place.
[03:41:30.220 --> 03:41:31.420]  The article continues,
[03:41:31.420 --> 03:41:32.780]  German Chancellor Angela Merkel
[03:41:32.780 --> 03:41:34.820]  and French President Emmanuel Macron,
[03:41:34.820 --> 03:41:38.220]  both previously suggested the distribution of EU funds
[03:41:38.220 --> 03:41:41.340]  should be linked to the number of asylum seekers.
[03:41:41.340 --> 03:41:43.940]  Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker declared last year
[03:41:43.940 --> 03:41:46.660]  the union will be lost without huge population transfer
[03:41:46.660 --> 03:41:48.900]  from Africa to Europe during an interview
[03:41:48.900 --> 03:41:49.900]  in which he hinted there are plans
[03:41:49.900 --> 03:41:51.860]  for the two continents to merge.
[03:41:51.860 --> 03:41:55.100]  Now, of course, this is based on the fundamental lie
[03:41:55.100 --> 03:41:59.460]  that Europe needs a labor force to work to pay taxes.
[03:41:59.460 --> 03:42:00.820]  But then you look at the figures
[03:42:00.820 --> 03:42:02.340]  for the newly arrived migrants,
[03:42:02.340 --> 03:42:05.540]  the ones who are on welfare, it's 85%.
[03:42:05.540 --> 03:42:08.140]  In some cases, it's over 90%.
[03:42:08.140 --> 03:42:09.780]  So they're not working.
[03:42:09.780 --> 03:42:11.820]  They're not contributing to the economy.
[03:42:11.820 --> 03:42:13.780]  They're not paying taxes.
[03:42:13.780 --> 03:42:15.100]  We're paying for them.
[03:42:15.100 --> 03:42:18.620]  So how on earth is that gonna solve the labor shortage,
[03:42:18.620 --> 03:42:21.340]  which is driven by the native populations
[03:42:21.340 --> 03:42:22.780]  not having children?
[03:42:22.780 --> 03:42:25.140]  It's not because they don't work.
[03:42:25.140 --> 03:42:26.380]  The figures show it.
[03:42:26.380 --> 03:42:29.820]  The vast majority of these migrants are on welfare.
[03:42:29.820 --> 03:42:32.220]  They're sucking off the state.
[03:42:32.220 --> 03:42:34.380]  So that argument that we need to import Africa
[03:42:34.380 --> 03:42:35.460]  because we're dying out,
[03:42:35.460 --> 03:42:36.860]  because we're not having children.
[03:42:36.860 --> 03:42:38.980]  So we're not gonna be able to fund social programs
[03:42:38.980 --> 03:42:39.860]  and pensions.
[03:42:39.860 --> 03:42:43.300]  It just doesn't wash its complete fake news.
[03:42:44.540 --> 03:42:45.380]  We'll be back.
[03:42:45.380 --> 03:42:46.820]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live breaking news
[03:42:46.820 --> 03:42:48.660]  at infowars.com.
[03:42:48.660 --> 03:42:51.660]  Don't go like that.
[03:42:53.780 --> 03:42:54.620]  I'm so excited.
[03:42:54.620 --> 03:42:57.340]  The new product at infowarslife.com,
[03:42:57.340 --> 03:43:01.220]  in a glass bottle, two month servings filled to the brim,
[03:43:01.220 --> 03:43:04.740]  filled to the absolute top, the real red pill.
[03:43:04.740 --> 03:43:07.700]  This is a heart and brain pill,
[03:43:07.700 --> 03:43:10.260]  a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulants in it.
[03:43:10.260 --> 03:43:13.260]  But boy, does it stimulate because it's beyond that.
[03:43:13.260 --> 03:43:15.900]  Quite frankly, I just went off
[03:43:15.900 --> 03:43:19.540]  what I saw of medical doctors prescribing to their patients.
[03:43:19.540 --> 03:43:21.060]  But it wasn't prescription,
[03:43:21.060 --> 03:43:25.820]  but they were charging people $100, $200 for the formulae.
[03:43:25.820 --> 03:43:27.300]  And I came up with our own formula
[03:43:27.300 --> 03:43:29.420]  working with some scientists and developers.
[03:43:29.420 --> 03:43:34.340]  Non-GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules.
[03:43:34.340 --> 03:43:37.540]  And ladies and gentlemen, you add the preglinone to it,
[03:43:37.540 --> 03:43:40.020]  which is the precursor to all the hormones
[03:43:40.020 --> 03:43:42.500]  that your body has to have to even make the hormones
[03:43:42.500 --> 03:43:43.580]  in your glands.
[03:43:43.580 --> 03:43:46.340]  It is amazing.
[03:43:46.340 --> 03:43:49.780]  Red pill now available at infowarsstore.com
[03:43:49.780 --> 03:43:53.500]  and your purchase funds the operation.
[03:43:53.500 --> 03:43:55.260]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you

[03:43:59.100 --> 03:43:59.940]  It'd take hours.
[03:43:59.940 --> 03:44:02.420]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price.
[03:44:02.420 --> 03:44:03.580]  It's stronger.
[03:44:03.580 --> 03:44:05.220]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[03:44:05.220 --> 03:44:08.380]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[03:44:08.380 --> 03:44:09.500]  It's back in stock.
[03:44:09.500 --> 03:44:12.700]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[03:44:12.700 --> 03:44:14.620]  It's got the preglinone that's the precursor
[03:44:14.620 --> 03:44:16.500]  to all the natural hormones in your body.
[03:44:16.500 --> 03:44:18.540]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins,
[03:44:18.540 --> 03:44:19.580]  the amino acids.
[03:44:19.580 --> 03:44:20.500]  So you can upload it.
[03:44:20.500 --> 03:44:22.420]  And our latest product that goes great
[03:44:22.420 --> 03:44:24.420]  with the super blue colloidal silver
[03:44:24.420 --> 03:44:26.580]  and iodine four to five toothpaste
[03:44:26.580 --> 03:44:29.660]  is super blue silver immune gargle.
[03:44:29.660 --> 03:44:30.580]  That's a spray you do.
[03:44:30.580 --> 03:44:31.860]  You can also swallow it.
[03:44:31.860 --> 03:44:36.500]  It's a supplement with iodine, a super high quality silver,
[03:44:36.500 --> 03:44:37.340]  and a lot more.

[03:49:03.540 --> 03:49:05.540]  but when you do it, you're a kook.
[03:49:05.540 --> 03:49:07.540]  You just buy it.

[03:50:08.540 --> 03:50:11.540]  Now, there's an article up on infowars.com right now.
[03:50:11.540 --> 03:50:13.540]  Kanye's real crime encouraging black people
[03:50:13.540 --> 03:50:15.540]  to think for themselves.
[03:50:15.540 --> 03:50:17.540]  I wrote this this morning.
[03:50:17.540 --> 03:50:19.540]  Of course, we had the big backlash to Kanye West
[03:50:19.540 --> 03:50:22.540]  merely saying he likes the ideas of Candace Owens,
[03:50:22.540 --> 03:50:24.540]  the ideas of encouraging black people
[03:50:24.540 --> 03:50:26.540]  to become independent,
[03:50:26.540 --> 03:50:28.540]  to become self-empowered,
[03:50:28.540 --> 03:50:30.540]  to become welfare.
[03:50:30.540 --> 03:50:32.540]  No, we can't have anyone saying that,
[03:50:32.540 --> 03:50:34.540]  especially somebody from the celebrity world.
[03:50:34.540 --> 03:50:36.540]  This article is kind of editorial on that.
[03:50:36.540 --> 03:50:38.540]  Of course, we had a follow-up to the whole
[03:50:38.540 --> 03:50:40.540]  Kanye controversy,
[03:50:40.540 --> 03:50:42.540]  where he allegedly told a radio host
[03:50:42.540 --> 03:50:44.540]  in a private conversation,
[03:50:44.540 --> 03:50:46.540]  Ebro Darden,
[03:50:46.540 --> 03:50:48.540]  quote, I love Donald Trump.
[03:50:48.540 --> 03:50:50.540]  And of course, you cannot say that you endorse
[03:50:50.540 --> 03:50:52.540]  or support the sitting president
[03:50:52.540 --> 03:50:54.540]  of the United States of America.
[03:50:54.540 --> 03:50:56.540]  That's just too controversial.
[03:50:56.540 --> 03:50:58.540]  We've got to the point where it's seen
[03:50:58.540 --> 03:51:00.540]  as controversial,
[03:51:00.540 --> 03:51:02.540]  where it's seen as offensive for a celebrity
[03:51:02.540 --> 03:51:04.540]  to support the president
[03:51:04.540 --> 03:51:06.540]  of the United States.
[03:51:06.540 --> 03:51:08.540]  That's the level we've reached.
[03:51:08.540 --> 03:51:10.540]  Now, according to Twitter, of course,
[03:51:10.540 --> 03:51:12.540]  this makes Kanye far right.
[03:51:12.540 --> 03:51:14.540]  And then Cenk Yuga, or Cenk Yuga of the Young Turks,
[03:51:14.540 --> 03:51:16.540]  came out yesterday
[03:51:16.540 --> 03:51:18.540]  in a tweet and said that
[03:51:18.540 --> 03:51:20.540]  Kanye's tweets make him
[03:51:20.540 --> 03:51:22.540]  one of the dumbest guys in the country.
[03:51:22.540 --> 03:51:24.540]  So, he's literally
[03:51:24.540 --> 03:51:26.540]  shaming him for having
[03:51:26.540 --> 03:51:28.540]  diversity of opinion.
[03:51:28.540 --> 03:51:30.540]  It doesn't make him one of the dumbest guys in the country.
[03:51:30.540 --> 03:51:32.540]  It makes him one of the bravest
[03:51:32.540 --> 03:51:34.540]  guys in the country.
[03:51:34.540 --> 03:51:36.540]  We had a situation this week with Shania Twain,
[03:51:36.540 --> 03:51:38.540]  the Canadian singer,
[03:51:38.540 --> 03:51:40.540]  where she basically said if she had been able to vote,
[03:51:40.540 --> 03:51:42.540]  she would have voted for Donald Trump.
[03:51:42.540 --> 03:51:44.540]  There you see Cenk Yuga's tweet
[03:51:44.540 --> 03:51:46.540]  calling Kanye
[03:51:46.540 --> 03:51:48.540]  an empty celebrity.
[03:51:48.540 --> 03:51:50.540]  He's the exact opposite. The empty celebrities
[03:51:50.540 --> 03:51:52.540]  have got nothing interesting to say.
[03:51:52.540 --> 03:51:54.540]  They never
[03:51:54.540 --> 03:51:56.540]  deviate from the norm, from this
[03:51:56.540 --> 03:51:58.540]  borderline that's viciously patrolled
[03:51:58.540 --> 03:52:00.540]  by the thought police in Hollywood,
[03:52:00.540 --> 03:52:02.540]  in the music industry. As soon as Kanye
[03:52:02.540 --> 03:52:04.540]  comes out and says something interesting,
[03:52:04.540 --> 03:52:06.540]  something a bit daring, something a bit edgy,
[03:52:06.540 --> 03:52:08.540]  he's dumb. No, he's not dumb.
[03:52:08.540 --> 03:52:10.540]  He's literally the bravest celebrity
[03:52:10.540 --> 03:52:12.540]  in America right now. Shania Twain,
[03:52:12.540 --> 03:52:14.540]  Canadian singer,
[03:52:14.540 --> 03:52:16.540]  comes out and says, yeah, if I'd have voted,
[03:52:16.540 --> 03:52:18.540]  been able to vote someone, I would have voted for Trump.
[03:52:18.540 --> 03:52:20.540]  The next day, absolutely destroyed.
[03:52:20.540 --> 03:52:22.540]  She had to grovel.
[03:52:22.540 --> 03:52:24.540]  She had to apologize to the
[03:52:24.540 --> 03:52:26.540]  baying online outrage mob
[03:52:26.540 --> 03:52:28.540]  for merely suggesting that she would have voted
[03:52:28.540 --> 03:52:30.540]  for the President of the United States.
[03:52:30.540 --> 03:52:32.540]  And again, this article
[03:52:32.540 --> 03:52:34.540]  gets into it.
[03:52:34.540 --> 03:52:36.540]  At what point did pop culture,
[03:52:36.540 --> 03:52:38.540]  did celebrities in general become so sterile
[03:52:38.540 --> 03:52:40.540]  that a prominent performer
[03:52:40.540 --> 03:52:42.540]  like Kanye West merely endorsing
[03:52:42.540 --> 03:52:44.540]  the President of the United States,
[03:52:44.540 --> 03:52:46.540]  and he didn't even do it himself publicly.
[03:52:46.540 --> 03:52:48.540]  This isn't a private conversation.
[03:52:48.540 --> 03:52:50.540]  How is that controversial?
[03:52:50.540 --> 03:52:52.540]  That should not be controversial.
[03:52:52.540 --> 03:52:54.540]  The article goes on
[03:52:54.540 --> 03:52:56.540]  whether you're a Trump supporter or not,
[03:52:56.540 --> 03:52:58.540]  you have to admire Kanye for going up against the machine,
[03:52:58.540 --> 03:53:00.540]  albeit one gradually losing power
[03:53:00.540 --> 03:53:02.540]  that swallows up the careers of anyone
[03:53:02.540 --> 03:53:04.540]  who steps out of line.
[03:53:04.540 --> 03:53:06.540]  Now, of course, Kanye's got some,
[03:53:06.540 --> 03:53:08.540]  I think he's got two albums coming out
[03:53:08.540 --> 03:53:10.540]  in about five weeks' time.
[03:53:10.540 --> 03:53:12.540]  So obviously he's trying to create some controversy,
[03:53:12.540 --> 03:53:14.540]  and people are bashing him for that.
[03:53:14.540 --> 03:53:16.540]  He's doing this to sell albums.
[03:53:16.540 --> 03:53:18.540]  Well, what did Eminem do?
[03:53:18.540 --> 03:53:20.540]  He did exactly the same thing.
[03:53:20.540 --> 03:53:22.540]  He tried to pick a fight with Trump
[03:53:22.540 --> 03:53:24.540]  to sell albums. It didn't work.
[03:53:24.540 --> 03:53:26.540]  His album was absolutely bashed
[03:53:26.540 --> 03:53:28.540]  even by his supporters in the media.
[03:53:28.540 --> 03:53:30.540]  Trump didn't even respond to him.
[03:53:30.540 --> 03:53:32.540]  Eminem had numerous hissy fits,
[03:53:32.540 --> 03:53:34.540]  and he failed completely. Oh, but Eminem can do it.
[03:53:34.540 --> 03:53:36.540]  Eminem can get political
[03:53:36.540 --> 03:53:38.540]  to try and sell albums,
[03:53:38.540 --> 03:53:40.540]  but not Kanye, because he doesn't have the right opinions,
[03:53:40.540 --> 03:53:42.540]  because we're going to viciously patrol
[03:53:42.540 --> 03:53:44.540]  the outer perimeter
[03:53:44.540 --> 03:53:46.540]  of acceptable discourse
[03:53:46.540 --> 03:53:48.540]  and opinion, because we're so tolerant,
[03:53:48.540 --> 03:53:50.540]  because we're so pro-diversity,
[03:53:50.540 --> 03:53:52.540]  apart from diversity of opinion, of course.
[03:53:52.540 --> 03:53:54.540]  Article continues,
[03:53:54.540 --> 03:53:56.540]  while conservatives will obviously waste no time
[03:53:56.540 --> 03:53:58.540]  in exploiting Kanye's comments
[03:53:58.540 --> 03:54:00.540]  for their own political grist.
[03:54:00.540 --> 03:54:02.540]  The real story here isn't Kanye moving to the right
[03:54:02.540 --> 03:54:04.540]  or becoming Trump's black twin,
[03:54:04.540 --> 03:54:06.540]  as Cenk Yuga claimed.
[03:54:06.540 --> 03:54:08.540]  The real question to ask is this.
[03:54:08.540 --> 03:54:10.540]  When did the left's opinion
[03:54:10.540 --> 03:54:12.540]  of African-Americans become so low
[03:54:12.540 --> 03:54:14.540]  that they automatically
[03:54:14.540 --> 03:54:16.540]  assume all black people should think the same,
[03:54:16.540 --> 03:54:18.540]  and that those who don't
[03:54:18.540 --> 03:54:20.540]  should be ridiculed, demonized,
[03:54:20.540 --> 03:54:22.540]  and smeared?
[03:54:22.540 --> 03:54:24.540]  That is the very essence
[03:54:24.540 --> 03:54:26.540]  of the bigotry of low expectations,
[03:54:26.540 --> 03:54:28.540]  and it's come to the fore
[03:54:28.540 --> 03:54:30.540]  like never before than this week
[03:54:30.540 --> 03:54:32.540]  with Kanye West and his controversial,
[03:54:32.540 --> 03:54:34.540]  controversial tweets,
[03:54:34.540 --> 03:54:36.540]  which shouldn't even be controversial.
[03:54:36.540 --> 03:54:38.540]  Of course, he also was tweeting out
[03:54:38.540 --> 03:54:40.540]  the videos yesterday,
[03:54:40.540 --> 03:54:42.540]  and they didn't like that, did they?
[03:54:42.540 --> 03:54:44.540]  In fact, I did a Google search
[03:54:44.540 --> 03:54:46.540]  about this, including my name.
[03:54:46.540 --> 03:54:48.540]  People say, oh, why do you Google search
[03:54:48.540 --> 03:54:50.540]  your own name to read the hit pieces
[03:54:50.540 --> 03:54:52.540]  every single day?
[03:54:52.540 --> 03:54:54.540]  It's part of my downtime.
[03:54:54.540 --> 03:54:56.540]  And it was slate.
[03:54:56.540 --> 03:54:58.540]  It was buzzfeed.
[03:54:58.540 --> 03:55:00.540]  They're all panicking about this
[03:55:00.540 --> 03:55:02.540]  because, as Andrew Breibach said,
[03:55:02.540 --> 03:55:04.540]  politics is downstream from culture.
[03:55:04.540 --> 03:55:06.540]  You get one guy
[03:55:06.540 --> 03:55:08.540]  who's a politician of leftist dogma
[03:55:08.540 --> 03:55:10.540]  and virtue signaling, cliche,
[03:55:10.540 --> 03:55:12.540]  and he's absolutely
[03:55:12.540 --> 03:55:14.540]  eviscerated. You see it right there.
[03:55:14.540 --> 03:55:16.540]  They're absolutely petrified over this
[03:55:16.540 --> 03:55:18.540]  because it's a massive watershed
[03:55:18.540 --> 03:55:20.540]  moment in the culture war,
[03:55:20.540 --> 03:55:22.540]  as I mentioned, as I talked about in my video,
[03:55:22.540 --> 03:55:24.540]  the truth about Kanye, which you can go
[03:55:24.540 --> 03:55:26.540]  and watch right now on YouTube.
[03:55:26.540 --> 03:55:28.540]  In fact, I think he's still embedded on
[03:55:28.540 --> 03:55:30.540]  infowars.com on the right-hand side, so go and watch that.
[03:55:30.540 --> 03:55:32.540]  Now, what he's talking about
[03:55:32.540 --> 03:55:34.540]  when he endorses the way
[03:55:34.540 --> 03:55:36.540]  Trump thinks. He's talking about Americans becoming
[03:55:36.540 --> 03:55:38.540]  more independent, less dependent
[03:55:38.540 --> 03:55:40.540]  on government, less dependent on welfare,
[03:55:40.540 --> 03:55:42.540]  which brings me to this headline out of
[03:55:42.540 --> 03:55:44.540]  CNS News.
[03:55:44.540 --> 03:55:46.540]  Trump hails lowest number of people
[03:55:46.540 --> 03:55:48.540]  forced to use food stamps.
[03:55:48.540 --> 03:55:50.540]  Here's a great stat, President Trump tweeted
[03:55:50.540 --> 03:55:52.540]  yesterday. Since January 2017,
[03:55:52.540 --> 03:55:54.540]  the number of people forced to use food stamps
[03:55:54.540 --> 03:55:56.540]  is down 1.9 million.
[03:55:56.540 --> 03:55:58.540]  So, since Trump
[03:55:58.540 --> 03:56:00.540]  took office, almost 2 million fewer
[03:56:00.540 --> 03:56:02.540]  people are on food stamps.
[03:56:02.540 --> 03:56:04.540]  He got off that level of dependency.
[03:56:04.540 --> 03:56:06.540]  He continued, the American people
[03:56:06.540 --> 03:56:08.540]  are finally back to work.
[03:56:08.540 --> 03:56:10.540]  In January 2018, the Agriculture
[03:56:10.540 --> 03:56:12.540]  Department's Food and Nutrition Service
[03:56:12.540 --> 03:56:14.540]  counted 40,700,000
[03:56:14.540 --> 03:56:16.540]  individuals as receiving food stamps.
[03:56:16.540 --> 03:56:18.540]  As Trump said, that's
[03:56:18.540 --> 03:56:20.540]  1.9 million fewer people on the snap rolls
[03:56:20.540 --> 03:56:22.540]  than the 42,600,000
[03:56:22.540 --> 03:56:24.540]  counted in January 2017
[03:56:24.540 --> 03:56:26.540]  when Trump
[03:56:26.540 --> 03:56:28.540]  took office.
[03:56:28.540 --> 03:56:30.540]  So, this has rarely come into the fore
[03:56:30.540 --> 03:56:32.540]  right now as the job figures continue to improve.
[03:56:32.540 --> 03:56:34.540]  Fewer people
[03:56:34.540 --> 03:56:36.540]  on food stamps, of course, a
[03:56:36.540 --> 03:56:38.540]  significant portion of those people on food stamps
[03:56:38.540 --> 03:56:40.540]  are going to be African Americans.
[03:56:40.540 --> 03:56:42.540]  They're getting off that dependency.
[03:56:42.540 --> 03:56:44.540]  They're getting off that welfare and becoming
[03:56:44.540 --> 03:56:46.540]  more self-empowered, which is exactly
[03:56:46.540 --> 03:56:48.540]  what Kanye West has talked
[03:56:48.540 --> 03:56:50.540]  about in his tweets, which is exactly
[03:56:50.540 --> 03:56:52.540]  what he means when he says he resonates
[03:56:52.540 --> 03:56:54.540]  with Candice Owens.
[03:56:54.540 --> 03:56:56.540]  So, ask yourself if the left really wants
[03:56:56.540 --> 03:56:58.540]  black people to be free,
[03:56:58.540 --> 03:57:00.540]  to be empowered, to be prosperous.
[03:57:00.540 --> 03:57:02.540]  Why are they upset
[03:57:02.540 --> 03:57:04.540]  when celebrities use their platform
[03:57:04.540 --> 03:57:06.540]  to help try and encourage
[03:57:06.540 --> 03:57:08.540]  to push that message?
[03:57:08.540 --> 03:57:10.540]  It really strikes at the heart of this bigotry
[03:57:10.540 --> 03:57:12.540]  of low expectations
[03:57:12.540 --> 03:57:14.540]  and just watch. With Kanye now
[03:57:14.540 --> 03:57:16.540]  they're going to go after him more than ever.
[03:57:16.540 --> 03:57:18.540]  They're going after Candice Owens more than ever.
[03:57:18.540 --> 03:57:20.540]  It's really going to get
[03:57:20.540 --> 03:57:22.540]  hot in a hurry because they're daring
[03:57:22.540 --> 03:57:24.540]  to communicate the message that
[03:57:24.540 --> 03:57:26.540]  black people don't have to all
[03:57:26.540 --> 03:57:28.540]  think alike.
[03:57:28.540 --> 03:57:30.540]  God forbid.
[03:57:30.540 --> 03:57:32.540]  Absolutely incredible.
[03:57:32.540 --> 03:57:34.540]  That's going to wrap it up for me.
[03:57:34.540 --> 03:57:36.540]  Owens Royer is coming up with The War Room
[03:57:36.540 --> 03:57:38.540]  next, breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:57:38.540 --> 03:57:40.540]  Stay right there.
[03:57:40.540 --> 03:58:08.540]  Don't go away.
[03:58:10.540 --> 03:58:36.540]  Don't go away.
[03:58:36.540 --> 03:58:40.540]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America
[03:58:40.540 --> 03:59:08.540]  and the National Rifle Association of America.
