[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:30.560]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones I want
[00:30.560 --> 00:39.560]  to try to control myself today and really calmly go over where we stand as a human
[00:39.560 --> 00:46.920]  population on this tiny planet and really break down the nature of the ruling class
[00:46.920 --> 00:56.240]  that is in control of our society and why they are engaging in a war against humanity a war
[00:56.240 --> 01:05.240]  against intellect a war against against health a war against truth why is that being done well
[01:05.240 --> 01:14.640]  it's easier to break things and dominate things and wreck things than to build people up and the
[01:14.640 --> 01:20.120]  globalist can just barely pull out every stop and engage in every dirty trick and do the most
[01:20.120 --> 01:25.880]  horrible things they can get away with against humanity and maintain control they could not
[01:25.880 --> 01:34.560]  maintain control unless they were totally ruthless and pulled out all the stops and became pure evil
[01:34.560 --> 01:41.480]  and they want the power so they've done it there's the answer in shorthand but I want to try to
[01:41.480 --> 01:47.840]  flesh that out a bit because knowing the enemy is half the battle knowing yourself is the other
[01:47.840 --> 01:53.000]  half and of course taking action is the imperative because if you know your enemy and know yourself
[01:53.000 --> 02:01.120]  you will take action but knowledge being aware of things that the the the people perish for
[02:01.120 --> 02:08.480]  lack of knowledge really is the key now if the global controllers really weren't just being
[02:08.480 --> 02:12.480]  competitive with each other and they actually looked further down the down the road they would
[02:12.480 --> 02:19.120]  see the type of system that's being developed and being established is very very dangerous for
[02:19.120 --> 02:26.240]  the ruling class itself but there's an overall hubris a nihilistic icing as well or cherry on
[02:26.240 --> 02:35.880]  top of this dehumanizing confection that has been manifested and if people think that's a scary
[02:35.880 --> 02:45.800]  paradigm I'm talking about they haven't read history also more and more I begin to realize that
[02:45.800 --> 02:53.840]  we are governed by fear and I know that's an obvious statement you're like tell me something I
[02:53.840 --> 03:02.760]  didn't know mr. Sherlock but do we really consciously understand what a mind killer fear
[03:02.760 --> 03:12.920]  really is it is and it is the attempt to go along with the system and the belief that that way
[03:12.920 --> 03:23.480]  leads towards success sustainability security empowerment that idea is the greatest lie of all
[03:23.480 --> 03:30.080]  because when you get a nation in a world of yes men and women when you get a bunch of biological
[03:30.080 --> 03:35.280]  androids who don't consciously discover the mysteries of the universe for themselves and who
[03:35.280 --> 03:39.760]  just do whatever they think is popular you might as well just be a computer sitting here on the
[03:39.760 --> 03:46.360]  table because you're just going with whatever you're programmed with and the message that go
[03:46.360 --> 03:51.280]  with this programming do what everybody else is doing and you'll be successful really I see a
[03:51.280 --> 03:55.760]  lot of people doing what everybody else does that aren't successful I'll tell you who really is
[03:55.760 --> 04:03.680]  successful in life or good and for evil and for all the points in between that's Mavericks trail
[04:03.680 --> 04:12.160]  blazers original thinkers and that's why the globalist poison the food and the water and the
[04:12.160 --> 04:17.480]  culture and engage in that ultimate sin is because they themselves are locked in to a
[04:17.480 --> 04:25.880]  co in to a conformity of evil they are locked in to a conformity of corruption they are in
[04:25.880 --> 04:33.080]  their own mafia their own gang their own secret society their own syndrome of psychopathic world
[04:33.080 --> 04:44.880]  view and they cannot break out of it they fear the Maverick true human and their entire system is
[04:44.880 --> 04:52.320]  designed to dominate that which they fear now I just laid the hardcore truth on you we're gonna
[04:52.320 --> 05:00.880]  break down the news and a lot more a big guest David I come on up stay with us sick of the globalist

[08:08.640 --> 08:18.280]  cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live
[08:18.280 --> 08:35.360]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones it is Thursday the 21st day of June 2012 I'm your host Alex Jones again
[08:35.360 --> 08:41.960]  thank you for joining us for this hour of resistance against tyranny always informative
[08:41.960 --> 08:49.800]  always thought-provoking David Ike will be joining us coming up in the second hour of the
[08:49.800 --> 08:56.240]  Worldwide broadcast today and Mark Moreno was unable to get his internet working in Rio de
[08:56.240 --> 09:00.640]  Janeiro down there at the big UN world government conference yesterday she'll be joining us via
[09:00.640 --> 09:07.080]  the landline in the last 30 minutes today Lord Moncton tomorrow I also talked to Billy Corrigan
[09:07.080 --> 09:11.640]  of the smashing pumpkin gesture day as new albums out I'm gonna tape an interview with him this
[09:11.640 --> 09:17.320]  weekend as he's about to leave the country and go do a tour in South America and we'll be airing
[09:17.320 --> 09:25.600]  that it should be on Monday or so much to be quite informative okay where to start here
[09:25.600 --> 09:36.160]  obviously there is the big news of House panel voting to cite Holder for contempt of Congress
[09:36.160 --> 09:46.880]  and the White House coming out and making the announcement that they're deploying executive
[09:46.880 --> 09:53.280]  privilege now executive privilege is if you have a as the president a private meeting with an
[09:53.280 --> 09:59.960]  ambassador to discuss private matters of their government so that you so that you as the president
[09:59.960 --> 10:06.600]  can understand delicate issues and then somebody in the House of Representatives who wants to
[10:06.600 --> 10:10.640]  make a name for themselves or whatever demands to know what you said in that private meeting and
[10:10.640 --> 10:16.680]  that's what happened with the first case of executive privilege in George Washington then it
[10:16.680 --> 10:27.960]  is kosher but if you're Richard Nixon who sends a bunch of burglars FBI agents and people like G
[10:27.960 --> 10:36.840]  Gordon Liddy to break into the Democratic National Committee's headquarters and to break into
[10:36.840 --> 10:45.080]  psychologists and psychiatrists offices to get dirt on people you're not above the law and that's
[10:45.080 --> 10:51.160]  the mistake Obama has made declaring executive privilege on this this is not the type of executive
[10:51.160 --> 10:57.720]  privilege that's been upheld this is a big sign that they are in hot water and of course first
[10:57.720 --> 11:05.480]  they said that these documents didn't exist that they're now declaring executive privilege on and
[11:05.480 --> 11:15.120]  I am going to go back in fact maybe later in the broadcast today because Rob do is out getting some
[11:15.120 --> 11:18.640]  equipment right now I'm going to tell him yesterday to get this or actually I did say it over
[11:18.640 --> 11:26.920]  ever personally gave him the message that I want the newscast we did earlier this year with the
[11:26.920 --> 11:39.880]  news clips from two years ago plus of the Attorney General Eric Holder the head of Homeland Security
[11:39.880 --> 11:45.840]  big sis to handle Paul Tano and others talking about fast and furious an operation gun runner in
[11:45.840 --> 11:50.840]  press conferences and talking about how they launched the operations now the details weren't
[11:50.840 --> 11:56.680]  known they were vague but by admitting the programs there they are admitting that obviously they the
[11:56.680 --> 12:04.440]  heads of these big agencies had given the orders and the FBI the ATF the border patrol the Coast Guard
[12:04.440 --> 12:11.160]  and four other agencies this all came out in the Chicago Tribune a year and a half ago this all
[12:11.160 --> 12:17.000]  came out on the El Paso times a year and a half ago this all came out at info wars.com and prison
[12:17.000 --> 12:24.600]  planet.com almost two years ago in fact we're always so busy covering the next news story that we
[12:24.600 --> 12:32.640]  rarely toot our horn and look we told you a week into it that Stuxnet was an Israeli US created
[12:32.640 --> 12:39.320]  program probably working with Microsoft according to our top tech experts that we had on. The
[12:39.320 --> 12:44.320]  Washington Post has been congratulated yesterday for breaking the fact that it was Israeli US
[12:44.320 --> 12:50.320]  government slash industry weapon and that now is spin off of that the flame virus is wrecking
[12:50.320 --> 12:55.280]  computers all over and the government is simultaneously saying give us more cybersecurity
[12:55.280 --> 13:00.320]  to take your rights away and to spy on you and put control hubs in everywhere in the
[13:00.320 --> 13:07.520]  infrastructure of all ISPs even more that are there now with all the EAS crud emergency alert
[13:07.520 --> 13:21.440]  system and they are now pushing this entire takeover agenda on the backs of viruses they launched
[13:22.240 --> 13:29.040]  just like our criminal government illegitimate foreign banker occupied system I mean it's not
[13:29.040 --> 13:35.760]  the government it calls itself that created Al Qaeda had the hijackers trained at US bases
[13:35.760 --> 13:42.880]  we don't know exactly what happened on 9-11 but I mean it's a fact AP Reuters news week that
[13:43.520 --> 13:48.480]  generals and colonels at the bases said my gosh these guys on the news all trained at our base
[13:48.480 --> 13:55.280]  and spy training in Florida and California and they went public and it was just swept out of the
[13:55.280 --> 14:01.040]  rug never mind Mohammed Atta and the other hijackers with their government credit cards and living
[14:01.040 --> 14:06.800]  with FBI informants and visiting topless bars and being protected and running drills of hijacking
[14:06.800 --> 14:12.640]  jets we know they were agents who thought they were taking part in drills that go on all the time
[14:12.640 --> 14:18.000]  try to get bombs on planes try to get guns on planes yeah that's why cops and others if they
[14:18.000 --> 14:23.360]  try to hire you to the feds do to take part in drill most of the time it is a drill but sometimes
[14:23.360 --> 14:30.160]  they're going to blow up a building and say you did it they're very sophisticated have you seen
[14:30.160 --> 14:35.440]  Arlington Road where the terrorist is very sophisticated movie because they imply they're
[14:35.440 --> 14:42.240]  really a government group you watch the movie it's very sophisticated they trick the professor
[14:42.240 --> 14:48.400]  who they've profiled who's a constitutionalist into showing up thinking he's about to stop a bombing
[14:48.400 --> 14:52.160]  and then he actually triggers it so they can have him as the patsey on the news
[14:52.160 --> 15:00.000]  and that's the type of stuff they do so you better understand that's how this works
[15:00.000 --> 15:07.760]  the guys on 77 led by known mi6 agent fox news bbc roiders look it up exact drills of exact targets
[15:07.760 --> 15:14.400]  being hit at the exact same time look it up london underground drill they tell the guys take
[15:14.400 --> 15:20.960]  these backpacks on they were supposed to hit three buses and three trains but instead they only hit
[15:20.960 --> 15:26.720]  two trains and a bus a bunch of them figured out what was happening ran for their lives
[15:26.720 --> 15:33.280]  were gunned down at canary wharf that even came out but was shut down guys are running the police
[15:33.280 --> 15:37.680]  shoot them kill them all right there on the spot later they killed a bunch of witnesses as well
[15:39.440 --> 15:43.120]  i mean this is what went on i mean they would the police would walk up people in the street
[15:43.120 --> 15:47.840]  and on subways for weeks after all right hold them up against the wall and unload a clip right
[15:47.840 --> 15:53.520]  in their head just getting rid of witnesses because they carried out that attack and they got these
[15:53.520 --> 15:58.960]  secularized muslims who wanted to climb to the social ranks and had been hired as informants
[15:58.960 --> 16:06.720]  to take part in drills and they sure did didn't they they sure did exact bus and exact trains at
[16:06.720 --> 16:13.760]  the exact time and exact location itn bbc i could play the newscast for you right now i've played
[16:13.760 --> 16:19.920]  it probably 50 times you don't believe me just type it in itn drills of 77 bombings or bbc
[16:19.920 --> 16:25.280]  drills of 77 bombings and you'll have them admitting it and why to hide it in plain view
[16:25.280 --> 16:29.600]  because if everybody's freaking out that took part in the drill and figuring out they were shut up
[16:29.600 --> 16:34.480]  and use this cover in case other agencies that weren't part of it discovered it or if things went
[16:34.480 --> 16:41.200]  wrong they start speaking out the program in the psych warfare manuals they're using is to go ahead
[16:41.200 --> 16:45.040]  and hide it in plain view and come out and say oh yes we're running a drill of the exact same
[16:45.040 --> 16:50.400]  targets exact same time exact same place being hit it's quite astounding and then people see that
[16:50.400 --> 16:55.360]  and think well i don't have to whistle blow now this is admitted so i'm teaching you psych warfare
[16:55.360 --> 17:00.320]  secrets here like a magician showing you the tricks i've just reverse engineered it all later i get
[17:00.320 --> 17:04.960]  declassified documents is exactly what i've already reverse engineered in my mind but literally word
[17:04.960 --> 17:10.160]  for word because i'm watching them do it and they're following manuals so i'm seeing word for word
[17:10.160 --> 17:14.160]  what's in the manual let me give you another manual for false flags that by the way was in one of the
[17:14.160 --> 17:19.520]  wiki leak documents the army admitted was accurate army captains and above who were in black ops special
[17:20.240 --> 17:26.880]  forces training for force multiplication have been taught at least since 1986 how to stage
[17:26.880 --> 17:35.040]  false flag terror attacks as a force multiplier you're outnumbered a hundred to one you know in
[17:35.040 --> 17:41.840]  a month of the uh the local groups going to invade that area you commit a massacre you kill a couple
[17:41.840 --> 17:47.680]  little kids down by the river leave enemy mementos there to get the local tribe to unify behind you
[17:47.680 --> 17:53.280]  and the argument they give these commanders ish you take the little kid you hang them it's very
[17:53.280 --> 17:58.320]  sad but she'll save hundreds of children you're strong enough to understand that aren't you captain
[17:58.320 --> 18:03.760]  yes sir i'm ready to take this mission good and 10 years after you've been killing little kids in
[18:03.760 --> 18:10.480]  the jungle enforce multiply your load and explosives into world trade center one two and seven that's
[18:10.480 --> 18:19.520]  how the twisting to the dark side works would you like me to continue here today because believe me
[18:19.520 --> 18:24.960]  the system doesn't like this people say well why are you still alive because if they kill me it will
[18:24.960 --> 18:30.400]  make me a martyr and everything i've said will then be seen as prophetic they still may do it
[18:30.400 --> 18:35.840]  people say well then why are you speaking out because there's no future unless we beat these
[18:35.840 --> 18:42.080]  people they've made the decision to be more evil than evil in the name of protecting society and
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.640]  it doesn't work that way it's like the ring of Mordor it's been turned towards evil and we're
[18:46.640 --> 18:55.680]  all going to hell in a handbasket here how do i go from uh the hijackers and drills
[18:55.680 --> 19:06.240]  often to black ops and often to how they set people up i don't know the point is is that it's
[19:06.240 --> 19:12.240]  all extremely important and you need to be made aware of it and i guess false flag attacks is on
[19:12.240 --> 19:19.120]  my mind because if i was obama and the and the and the clicks and the power structure that support
[19:19.120 --> 19:26.720]  him the the the the gangs and the overall governing predator class that are using him as a pawn right
[19:26.720 --> 19:33.360]  now they're either going to go ahead and let obama be destroyed maybe even impeached or
[19:34.240 --> 19:39.440]  they're going to use this to trigger the pretext for the phoenix to rise again with false flag
[19:39.440 --> 19:44.240]  terror attacks so that's probably why i'm getting off into terror attacks oh i started getting off
[19:44.240 --> 19:50.960]  in a terror attacks talking about how the west runs al qaeda okay we're going to come back and get
[19:50.960 --> 20:01.520]  into uh the nixonian death spiral politically of the lame duck mr obama straight ahead i had tried
[20:01.520 --> 20:06.480]  everything i'd cut back the amount of food i was eating i was lifting weights and jogging but nothing
[20:06.480 --> 20:12.160]  was working my body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[20:12.160 --> 20:17.920]  and as soon as i had that i immediately could eat half of what i was eating previously and be
[20:17.920 --> 20:23.040]  satisfied now there are hundreds of great products at info wars team dot com but i want to point out
[20:23.040 --> 20:31.680]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months products like beyond tangy
[20:31.680 --> 20:37.360]  tangerine pollen burst and rebound when i started taking the tangy tangerine and other products every
[20:37.360 --> 20:44.320]  day i lost more than 37 pounds in just two months now that's results i want to challenge my listeners

[24:15.920 --> 24:20.560]  okay i want to get into the news here ahead of david ike joining us and then we'll have open phones
[24:20.560 --> 24:25.440]  for part of the interview with david and calls into the third hour today with morano
[24:25.440 --> 24:29.280]  popping in from rio de Janeiro again he couldn't make it yet because of internet problems
[24:29.920 --> 24:36.880]  there are a lot of different things i want to get in today obviously but morocco obama
[24:37.840 --> 24:44.800]  declaring executive privilege and the media is sitting there debating back and forth whether
[24:44.800 --> 24:50.640]  or not he can do this could obama declare executive privilege for say
[24:53.360 --> 24:59.360]  shelling crack cocaine could george w bush do that no you can't could
[25:02.240 --> 25:05.280]  morocco obama declare executive privilege for say
[25:07.040 --> 25:10.880]  not paying his quote income taxes at the private fellow reserve no he couldn't
[25:10.880 --> 25:17.600]  could morocco obama declare executive privilege on raping a woman on the white house lawn or
[25:17.600 --> 25:22.000]  roasting a puppy dog on the white house lawn the answer is no he couldn't
[25:24.480 --> 25:27.440]  and so what we see here is this normalization of corruption
[25:28.160 --> 25:33.440]  it's just like when the troops got caught openly being ordered to grow opium and they were speaking
[25:33.440 --> 25:37.680]  out against it five years ago they just started having newscast everywhere admitting they grow
[25:37.680 --> 25:43.280]  the opium to demystify it and claim that it's patriotic to do it and here's the headline heroin
[25:43.280 --> 25:49.280]  use is soaring among suburban teenagers is death from drug more than double in europe england the
[25:49.280 --> 25:56.960]  united states you name it it's pouring in because they've gone from 10 of world production to 93
[25:56.960 --> 26:03.760]  percent in just 10 years in afghanistan thanks to the liberation and again the police pull you over
[26:03.760 --> 26:08.080]  and ask you i had a cop one time put me over in austin when i was coming home from a business
[26:08.080 --> 26:12.240]  meeting he said have you been drinking and i said no he said have you done any illegal drugs like
[26:12.240 --> 26:18.320]  heroin cocaine pcp and i just started laughing at him and i said i said come on you know who
[26:18.320 --> 26:24.800]  brings all that in i said do i look like i use heroin cocaine or pcp it's 10 o'clock at night
[26:24.800 --> 26:30.560]  and i'm driving home working no i don't use heroin cocaine or pcp but i've had a whole
[26:30.560 --> 26:33.360]  lot of coffee buddy is that okay
[26:36.320 --> 26:42.560]  i mean it's a joke the government ships that in publicly the big banks launder it and we
[26:42.560 --> 26:47.200]  have a debate about decriminalizing this they don't want to decriminalize it because they make
[26:47.200 --> 26:53.920]  a hundred times the money literally when my grandmother was a little girl she could go down
[26:53.920 --> 26:58.560]  if somebody had a toothache at her house and just grab a bottle of laudanum for grandma who you
[26:58.560 --> 27:02.800]  know had a lot of toothaches because she liked laudanum i'm giving a hypothetical story the point
[27:02.800 --> 27:09.920]  is is that you could buy cocaine heroin opium anything you wanted and drug use was much lower
[27:11.120 --> 27:17.280]  you make alcohol illegal for 10 years nine and a half years are in prohibition crime more than
[27:17.280 --> 27:23.600]  tripled corruption of police everybody knows this again but people say oh i'm scared to say that they
[27:23.600 --> 27:28.800]  might get me they're going to get you and i'm going to say this then come back and get into noose but
[27:29.520 --> 27:35.040]  we had a general manager on yesterday a lot of one of eric muller mancow's stations
[27:36.320 --> 27:40.880]  and he's heard from like 60 of his stations that when i'm on or jessey ventura's on talking about
[27:40.880 --> 27:46.320]  fema camps it gets scrambled and by the way mancow's freaked out i mean you know he jokes around a
[27:46.320 --> 27:50.400]  lot he's actually freaked out this is really happening and we've gotten some calls this is
[27:50.400 --> 27:55.200]  happening that's why i think it's the eas at the station it's not the satellites you know the government
[27:55.200 --> 28:00.400]  has the criminals that have hijacked the government i've got to decondition myself as well reeducate
[28:00.400 --> 28:04.240]  myself the criminals that have hijacked the government have these illegal backdoors into
[28:04.240 --> 28:09.120]  everything they admit they do two months ago petraeus head of the cia bragged in a press
[28:09.120 --> 28:12.400]  conference that they're listening to everything without warrants and they're tracking everything
[28:12.400 --> 28:17.840]  and the smart meters are really these hubs like you know google cars that had those little
[28:17.840 --> 28:22.080]  masks with all the tech in it to grab all your communications that's what the smart meter is
[28:23.600 --> 28:29.440]  and we had this general manager on and he goes listen i'm just a guy trying to sell advertising
[28:29.440 --> 28:37.920]  stay afloat i got a wife and kids hey i get that you think hey my number one job as a father
[28:38.560 --> 28:44.720]  is to make a living morally and take care of my wife and children i get that but there's no future
[28:44.720 --> 28:50.400]  sure it'd be like 1941 germany and saying well i got to do what i'm told something will happen
[28:50.400 --> 28:54.800]  and then overall 20 million germans got killed did you know that close to a third their population
[28:55.680 --> 29:02.240]  from 1940 to 45 gone 20 i think the numbers 21 million germans died one way or another i
[29:02.240 --> 29:07.600]  mean was it should you shed no upfront or gone along with this people say well i'll just keep
[29:07.600 --> 29:13.520]  my head down and hope i'm okay that's the attitude that destroys civilizations that's the attitude
[29:13.520 --> 29:17.280]  that brings slavery and i'm not knocking that general manager by the end of it he's like no i
[29:17.280 --> 29:22.080]  guess i'll put more shows on like man cow and yours actually got a call from bunch of stations
[29:22.800 --> 29:27.680]  man cow stations wanting to get me after that show yesterday the the general managers and program
[29:27.680 --> 29:35.680]  directors understood that oh yeah if we don't say no now it's all over see that's the thing we've
[29:35.680 --> 29:43.280]  gotten to this position by giving in by being afraid by doing what the authority say when the
[29:43.280 --> 29:48.400]  authorities are a bunch of crooks out of control you're gonna turn your guns in obama says so

[39:28.880 --> 39:36.000]  years old one a man who died in india in the 1950s that skulls from india speaking of products
[39:36.000 --> 39:44.240]  from india india later banned the exportation of human bones because in the old days they were
[39:44.240 --> 39:50.880]  almost all from india and that's why we didn't have plastic bones at medical school and dental school
[39:52.160 --> 39:57.920]  had the real ones because that was their main export but it was seen as dehumanizing and so no
[39:57.920 --> 40:06.560]  more really my grandfather gave his body to medical science is that dehumanizing i thought it was the
[40:06.560 --> 40:12.320]  opposite about not being squeamish not being hung up on your body not being vain
[40:14.800 --> 40:18.320]  not caring of a bunch of medical students sit there and look at an old dead man
[40:22.800 --> 40:27.600]  i think the fact that this guy isn't in the ground or wasn't cremated as they do in india
[40:27.600 --> 40:35.120]  most of the time actually gives more life to it i think it kind of be neat if my skeleton hung in
[40:35.120 --> 40:39.600]  a medical school somewhere so i could still have a connection to the living
[40:42.640 --> 40:48.400]  not out of any vanity but out of a love of humanity i feel the connection all the way
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.080]  back to my ancestors right through to today and i can project out towards the horizon
[40:54.080 --> 41:00.880]  and for my progeny it's like electricity it's a connection to the past the present and the future
[41:00.880 --> 41:07.040]  but if the globalist extinct humanity or destroy our genetics or irrevocably change who we are
[41:07.040 --> 41:14.320]  as they say they're doing right now then that chain is destroyed and i can look out into the future
[41:14.320 --> 41:24.720]  and i see a haze on the horizon i'm not sure in my ancient hardwired super programming
[41:25.440 --> 41:32.240]  you know what is your subconscious the giant library that is my instincts and everything
[41:32.240 --> 41:38.320]  that my ancestors passed on to me i do not know if humanity is going to make it into the future
[41:38.320 --> 41:44.400]  i see so far into the future and then i see a haze
[41:48.400 --> 41:52.080]  is death and the beauty that is humanity
[41:56.320 --> 41:58.240]  is death all that is in our future
[42:01.200 --> 42:02.880]  people are so fascinated with death
[42:02.880 --> 42:08.800]  but even a skull which is a symbol of death for many for me it's a symbol of life
[42:09.680 --> 42:15.680]  the amazing species we are other creatures skulls look nothing like that do they
[42:15.680 --> 42:18.960]  what an amazing superior species no doubt
[42:22.400 --> 42:29.440]  when i was a child the skull had all of its teeth one time my parents blue healer somehow got up on
[42:29.440 --> 42:37.280]  the bookshelf and got it and chewed on it a bit and my dad actually taught in dental school
[42:37.920 --> 42:42.720]  to be technical he got this at the end of dental school because they wanted him to stay on and
[42:42.720 --> 42:48.000]  and teach some there and that's when he got this skull so he taught at baler dental school with
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.960]  this skull it's illegal to have one of these if you're not in the medical profession this is on
[42:54.960 --> 43:01.840]  loan here to us from my father but i will be talking more about this threes and the skulls
[43:01.840 --> 43:06.960]  here as we're doing a video imagine what it's about i've got a 65 million year old crocodile
[43:06.960 --> 43:15.760]  skull and i've got a human skull what is the video production going to be about i wonder
[43:15.760 --> 43:27.920]  okay enough of that getting into the nature of fear
[43:28.720 --> 43:37.440]  i talked to grown men and going back like 15 16 years ago people in business government you name it
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.960]  they would come over and talk to me in a restaurant or on a hike and bike trailer at the
[43:42.960 --> 43:48.160]  capital or at a radio station and they'd say you know you're right about a lot of this but what are
[43:48.160 --> 43:52.640]  you going to do about it you're going to protect yourself mr. jones if you try to join the system
[43:52.640 --> 43:57.680]  and work within it to be a balancing force and i'd say well there's no balance when we're
[43:57.680 --> 44:03.200]  headed a million miles an hour towards total dehumanization and enslavement the balance
[44:03.200 --> 44:08.640]  is standing steadfastly against that and not compromising because in a world where everybody
[44:08.640 --> 44:17.200]  compromises except the tyrants we allow them to take over the planet and then history shows the
[44:17.200 --> 44:25.120]  elites themselves cannot control the terminal collapse in society because the worst of the
[44:25.120 --> 44:32.720]  worst is automatically the new status quo you let's just say you want to be a little bit corrupt
[44:32.720 --> 44:40.400]  and there's a 5 000 foot deep channel out in the ocean you're swimming in and corruption is symbolized
[44:40.400 --> 44:45.840]  by being under the surface and you're like you know why i just want to be a little corrupt i think
[44:45.840 --> 44:50.560]  i'll go 10 feet under here but you see the most corrupt in the society once you give into corruption
[44:50.560 --> 44:58.640]  and evil and all the excuses that come with it is going to be at the rock bottom and there's a
[44:58.640 --> 45:06.000]  bottomless channel and so you just want to be a little corrupt but you're tied to a giant 10 000
[45:06.000 --> 45:11.200]  pound iron weight or anvil or millstone to your leg with a big chain you can't get out of
[45:13.920 --> 45:19.360]  and we're sitting out here on the boat and uh the anvil's over there on the edge of the ship and
[45:19.360 --> 45:25.200]  you're like you know what alex i think you're going to be at the rock bottom this is a bottomless
[45:25.200 --> 45:29.680]  over there on the edge of the ship and you're like you know what alex i think you're a square
[45:29.680 --> 45:35.440]  i think i'm going to go along with corruption i think abortion's okay i think uh open borders
[45:35.440 --> 45:39.760]  is okay i think world government's kind of trendy you know the television said so i want to be cool
[45:39.760 --> 45:46.720]  you know i i think prozac's good i think um i think being involved is stupid i'm just going
[45:46.720 --> 45:52.000]  to have fun and care about myself and i'm like you better not push that anvil over the side
[45:52.000 --> 45:58.000]  and the minute you push that anvil over the side it's going to suck you down to the bottom and you
[45:58.000 --> 46:07.440]  see societally we're all now tied to the anvil going down towards the bottom and at any time we
[46:07.440 --> 46:16.000]  could here's the catch at any time we can flip a catch and release the chain and truth and honor
[46:16.000 --> 46:24.240]  and veritas and recognizing good from evil strength from weakness beauty from ugliness
[46:27.680 --> 46:31.200]  justice from corruption that is
[46:34.000 --> 46:41.200]  the oxygen of everything good and so even though we're thousands of feet under in a sea of evil
[46:41.200 --> 46:48.320]  and plunging fast and can't even see the light up at the surface and the system's telling us that
[46:48.320 --> 46:54.320]  memory of the light was a figment of our imaginations and a conspiracy theory as we plunge downwards
[46:55.280 --> 47:01.200]  at any time we can release ourselves but the dark embrace
[47:03.520 --> 47:08.800]  the call of the night the call of the darkness the call of the evil a lot of cowards think if
[47:08.800 --> 47:15.120]  they merge with it if they get into it if they get good at it if they serve it if they kneel before
[47:15.120 --> 47:21.040]  it that somehow the black wings of the new world order that that bird of prey if they snuggle up
[47:21.040 --> 47:25.280]  to it like a little chick that it's going to be nice to them and that is not the case
[47:30.480 --> 47:33.120]  we must resist the system
[47:33.120 --> 47:41.600]  and it's common sense but to sit there and have to explain to full grown men hey if you don't start
[47:41.600 --> 47:46.560]  complaining about the direction of where things are going and start saying no then the sky's the
[47:46.560 --> 47:52.960]  limit you should be afraid of that not of what is individually going to happen to you sure some of
[47:52.960 --> 47:59.360]  us have to take a really bold alamo level stand and who knows if we'll make it out of it because
[47:59.360 --> 48:04.400]  somebody's got to make the stand up front to point out there's a war going on but the victory
[48:04.400 --> 48:10.480]  would be so easy if people would just recognize what's good from what's bad it's it's very very
[48:10.480 --> 48:15.920]  elementary of course we got into this discussion of good and evil yesterday just briefly because
[48:16.720 --> 48:20.400]  the station manager of you know that we had almost talking about yeah when you talk about
[48:20.400 --> 48:24.640]  fema camps with man cow they they scramble it or top the transmitter off it's got to be the
[48:24.640 --> 48:30.480]  eas system the engineer saying what do we do you know that they admit they've got all this back
[48:30.480 --> 48:34.320]  door tech and everything now and they're doing this as a test and the president is going to be
[48:34.320 --> 48:39.200]  breaking in and taking over you know while we've got a license you know they could take it as if
[48:39.200 --> 48:44.560]  the government is everybody as if that licensing system says you've got to do whatever the government
[48:44.560 --> 48:49.600]  says no you've got to serve the community well is it serving the community to keep the first
[48:49.600 --> 48:55.120]  amendment and free speech and to warn people about things that are happening and to admit that these
[48:55.120 --> 49:00.960]  backdoor systems are kicking in and erasing stuff off teavos you name it or do we just go oh my gosh
[49:00.960 --> 49:07.200]  that's kind of scary i better not say anything about this as if the FCC and as if the government
[49:07.200 --> 49:14.480]  is just god and we'll just do whatever they say because the the NRA got documents and reported
[49:14.480 --> 49:21.680]  on this a few months ago in the washington times that obama does intend by executive fiat to ban
[49:21.680 --> 49:26.560]  all semi-autos and the atf said earlier this year until there was such a backlash they said okay
[49:26.560 --> 49:32.640]  we'll do it the second term just look it up most shotguns were to be banned just type in atf announce
[49:32.640 --> 49:38.240]  a shotgun man it said any shotgun that's bottom loading that's that that that's either pump or
[49:38.240 --> 49:44.000]  semi-auto because you can convert them to clips they said as a non sporting function as if the
[49:44.000 --> 49:50.000]  second amendment sporting as if that's its only quote right and that they're going to ban them and
[49:50.000 --> 49:55.440]  it came out like 63 of shotguns sold the last decade and the numbers i saw they say they're
[49:55.440 --> 49:59.840]  going to do that so you're pretty much forced to vote for mit romney even if you know he's bad
[49:59.840 --> 50:03.920]  because would he dare do that as a republican that would destroy the republican party he still
[50:03.920 --> 50:11.360]  might do it the point is is that i mean i'm to the point that if they come out and say
[50:11.360 --> 50:18.560]  hey we're banning your shotguns i'm not turning them in i mean you that's why i'm fighting so hard
[50:18.560 --> 50:25.120]  now to turn this around before we get to the point where it's 1776 lessons in concord and they're
[50:25.120 --> 50:30.960]  coming to take our guns and it's like okay i got i guess that's it and then and then the poor moron
[50:32.240 --> 50:36.560]  minions they're going to send out a i mean this is a planned civil war that's going to wreck the
[50:36.560 --> 50:40.640]  citizens the police the military everybody why don't we just come together and not be in this
[50:40.640 --> 50:45.280]  mentality and wake up from this nightmare and not go down this road i mean do you understand
[50:45.280 --> 50:51.200]  where we're going but we've got to have the courage to be honest about it the globalists want a civil
[50:51.200 --> 50:56.400]  war in this country we've got to find the way out of this we've got to be smart enough and we've
[50:56.400 --> 51:02.640]  got to have the courage to save ourselves for a long time you've heard me talk about building

[54:34.880 --> 54:40.640]  to introduce a new propaganda the public is reporting on what we reported on a few years
[54:40.640 --> 54:47.840]  ago his homeland security already announced it they're going to have three lanes or smart tunnels
[54:47.840 --> 54:55.360]  you go through at the airport one is a full groping strip search everything else the other is only a
[54:55.360 --> 55:01.520]  basic search face scan thumbprint and the other is trusted globalist minions the new class system
[55:02.320 --> 55:06.480]  everybody's too busy worrying of their black or white or whatever to recognize this you know it's
[55:06.480 --> 55:12.240]  discrimination when obama supporters get health care waivers but nobody else does see but but
[55:12.240 --> 55:17.440]  people only think of race or religion as a discrimination now if the globalists say you're
[55:17.440 --> 55:22.720]  a good little minion you get to fly not being hassled that's the new system coming out and
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.120]  that's being announced and if they want you to be an informant you can't fly six months later the
[55:27.120 --> 55:31.200]  fbi calls you just come meet with us they go yeah we'll let you off that list we know you're not a
[55:31.200 --> 55:38.720]  bad person if you inform on people for us you're and they're like what inform on people indentured
[55:38.720 --> 55:46.720]  servitude that's how this system works but people again think of discrimination only as it's put
[55:46.720 --> 55:53.920]  forward with tv ads now running saying whites are bad people by the way the psych warfare chiefs
[55:53.920 --> 55:59.760]  want that for division that's actually going to make white people most of them feel real scared of
[55:59.760 --> 56:04.400]  black people and embarrassed like they have done something wrong and so they'll try to stay away
[56:04.400 --> 56:08.320]  from black people it's not that they won't hire black people because they just like them they
[56:08.320 --> 56:14.320]  won't hire them because they're scared very sophisticated what's going on we're going to be
[56:14.320 --> 56:19.760]  breaking that down it turns out that the trevon video that the court has does show a trevon
[56:19.760 --> 56:24.640]  what zemerman said had happened but my point is this is all a complete political diversion
[56:24.640 --> 56:30.480]  i'm going to be getting into that more on obama declaring executive privilege which you can't do
[56:30.480 --> 56:35.200]  over crimes which before they said they didn't have any documents so they've been caught perjuring
[56:35.200 --> 56:42.720]  again this could be his waterloo this could be his uh his end of the road which is a good thing
[56:42.720 --> 56:47.920]  overall because you want to punish out of controlled executives and and and and scare the next crop
[56:47.920 --> 56:57.280]  of crux but here it is checkpoint of the future take shape at texas airport love field that's the
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.160]  airport right in the middle of dallas yeah used to be great double flight of dallas in 25 minutes
[57:02.160 --> 57:07.920]  back for the tsa i could just fly up there see family before i got a girlfriend and got married
[57:07.920 --> 57:14.080]  go flop there go see girlfriends and uh not anymore i'm not going up to dallas not going
[57:14.080 --> 57:19.040]  to their water parks not visiting family up there unless i drive because i can't have my children
[57:19.040 --> 57:23.840]  subjected to dome pedophiles it's a real simple equation uh you're like you won't let your kids
[57:23.840 --> 57:29.360]  be grabbed and grope by men with weird mustaches with potbellies as they lick their lips uh no i won't
[57:29.920 --> 57:34.400]  it's sexual assault when anybody else doesn't i wouldn't let anybody do that to my kids i can't
[57:34.400 --> 57:40.880]  physically watch that happen i would become very physically angry things would not be good
[57:42.320 --> 57:47.280]  and i guess because i'm a weirdo i get angry at stuff that everybody else 50 years ago would get
[57:47.280 --> 57:55.440]  mad at i'm a throwback i'm a barney rubble what's the other guy's name on there fred flinstone yeah

[58:59.680 --> 59:03.840]  seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[59:03.840 --> 59:08.240]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[59:08.240 --> 59:13.040]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[59:13.040 --> 59:19.040]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[59:19.040 --> 59:23.360]  for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically modified

[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.560]  here live on this thursday edition a couple program notes
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:44.480]  number one i will be live this sunday 4 to 6 p.m. with the sunday radio show i'll leave it at that
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:52.240]  number two i will be out on the streets of austin today hanging up obama posters
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:59.920]  stop the dictator obama and we've been sent hundreds and hundreds of entries for the contest
[01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:07.760]  if you go to info wars.com it says stop obama contest is a green link up there in the nav bar
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:14.000]  by the breaking news red link and hundreds of people are sending us great photo shops of posters
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.840]  and they're saying here's my entry read the rules you have to create or use our posters
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:26.240]  that we have right there and then hang them in public legal lawful comments like the downtown
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:29.840]  area where all the other posters are at and because it is political somebody might try to say something
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:35.120]  to you but they if it's a commons area where everybody does that and it's fine they can't
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.040]  say anything check your local laws on the other hand i'm being sent some videos that are really
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.080]  great but it's like hanging them up at gas stations and i don't mean on the bulletin board i mean
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:51.680]  like sticking them to things folks you don't want to do that or if you do just make sure it's in a
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.600]  public commons area where other people do it you know if it's a telephone pole with a hundred
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:01.360]  you know nails in it or a thousand nails it's almost like a work of art how many nails there are
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:07.120]  for some reason i think that looks cool and and yeah you go staple it up there or glue it up there
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.440]  that's fine somebody says something to you and it's like did you just did you go after the lady with
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:17.200]  the lost dog sign above it you don't like my political speech that is the most protected
[01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:22.640]  and so the point of this contest is then the media will start covering these
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.400]  and then it will get more attention and and and this is an example of the grassroots power
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:33.840]  of people going out and hanging up signs everybody needs to do it even if you're
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:40.880]  not trying to win the fifteen thousand dollars five thousand dollars in by midnight central tomorrow
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.280]  and we're going to watch them over the weekend and by monday night on nightly news we'll announce
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.360]  the winner that's phase one to get just get it going then two weeks later ten thousand dollars
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:57.760]  but legal lawful areas it's so easy i mean look if you went out to the outside of a sporting event
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:02.000]  and handed out a thousand copies and shot a good video of it that would be in the running
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:06.960]  uh if you went to the big downtown district where there's all the thousands of posters
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.480]  and hung up it's whoever hangs up the most and shoots a good video of it and uploads it to youtube
[01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:19.680]  and then sends it to contested in full wars dot com and again we're getting hundreds and hundreds
[01:03:19.680 --> 01:03:23.440]  of great posters sent to us we're happy to link to those some of them are a lot better than even
[01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:28.960]  ours we have some great graphics people k did an amazing job here in our office on that one
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:34.800]  one murdering dictator obama in full wars dot com i show him some of the other ones but we also
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:39.600]  have listeners sending us some very creative ones but but it's not a poster contest just to make a
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:48.640]  poster okay it's to hang them in public get off the bench and get involved on the street
[01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:55.840]  that's what it is all about and people say well why don't you do a a a a mit romney one
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:04:00.480]  okay we'll we'll create a half obama half romney one the point is it's obama that's the
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.160]  trying to become a dictator right now well if romney does all this stuff he gets him will
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:10.000]  go after him you better believe it politically he he is launching wars without approval going
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:16.320]  after our guns without laws he is shutting down power plants without laws he's legalizing illegals
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.200]  this is horrible and when the media freaks out about it they're taking the bait so after you're
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.320]  done hanging them up call up the local news and say did you see this downtown there's hundreds of
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:31.680]  posters calling obama murdering scum uh it might have a report on it here's the streets so the idiots
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:37.280]  who hate free speech go out and show themselves then they'll run tv pieces against it it'll backfire
[01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:40.800]  and everybody else that understands it will go put them up that's what happened three years ago

[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:23.200]  the spear when it comes to trying to break humanity out of the mind control physical trance that
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:28.320]  people are under medically that's mainline science the general public of television
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:35.840]  ipad heads is in a near sleep state sleep walking phase major studies out just type in
[01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:43.040]  all simmers television viewing heavily connected to all simmers people are literally in a sleep
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:53.040]  state they are the waking walking zombie undead and we are here to unlock their minds what does
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:09:02.800]  john carpenter show us in they live they live we sleep we are in their little false matrix like
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:08.800]  consumer reality meanwhile the real decisions are going on around us and humanity is doing
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:18.560]  one of two things sinking deeper into the sleep of living death the trance or accelerating their
[01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:26.080]  awakening we are in such an incredible crossroads this time is so amazing right now but those that
[01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:29.760]  think they're going to find satisfaction through madison avenue in this culture of death
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.800]  they're more unhappy than ever and desperate all the studies and research show but those
[01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:39.920]  that are awakening are so alive we can hardly even handle it it's so incredible
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:46.560]  the new world order cannot fulfill you ladies and gentlemen and that's the trap you get deeper
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:51.200]  into it you think that you'll be happy if you just go still deeper we're going to be talking to
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:56.960]  david icke icon of awakening here in just a moment david icke.com Alex Jones of course
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:03.440]  of info wars.com it is the 21st day of june 2012 on this thursday transmission here's some of what's
[01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:10.720]  coming up after david leaves us the new tsa checkpoints expanding outside the airports
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:16.320]  trusted traveler but they're going to keep the groping just add more with the hope that maybe
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.760]  if you behave yourself you won't have to be abused total pavlovian psychological conditioning we
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.720]  told you a decade ago after they terrorized you with the tsa they would give you the solution
[01:10:26.720 --> 01:10:33.120]  the casual society face scanning to buy and sell this begins with the tsa authorizing you to have
[01:10:33.120 --> 01:10:37.680]  jobs to travel it's an open announcement that's how we knew all this was coming the highway
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.360]  checkpoints all of it it's happening worldwide by the way standardized big supreme court announcements
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:48.320]  are set to come out today or in the next few days on socialist health care eugenics health care all
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:54.400]  of it house panel votes to siteholder for contempt of congress obama pulls a nixon incites executive
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.160]  privilege but you can't do that for crimes you only do that for private government operations
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:06.160]  you know private meetings with ambassadors and people you can't do it with shipping guns to
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.880]  mexico as a false flag terror attack will this false flag terror attack that's killed thousands
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:15.440]  on both sides of the border bring this criminal to justice and it isn't a good thing we'll ask
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:21.120]  david ike here in a moment is it good to punish a puppet does it scare other puppets not to follow
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:26.480]  their master's orders it's a big victory fast and furious came out because atf wasn't pure evil
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:32.960]  started leaking it also coming up they're running new tv ads saying whites are inherently racist and
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:39.200]  bad this is to create racial division right as many race wars break out and many blacks believe
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.280]  whites are evil and are now physically attacking them the media is saying this is a great thing
[01:11:43.280 --> 01:11:48.960]  they want to set each other's throats we're also going to get into australia plays its part in quote
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.480]  going green carbon taxes start next week they say you'll be arrested if you criticize the carbon
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:12:00.480]  taxes you cannot make up the magnitude of this we're going to be breaking it all down today
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:07.920]  and joining us now is david ike i haven't talked to david best-selling author former champion
[01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:16.160]  golly bbc anchor news and sports uh i say head of the green party uh he's here with us former
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:20.800]  head of the green party he's here with us uh today as he joins us every few months graciously out of
[01:12:20.800 --> 01:12:27.760]  his busy schedule to continue to chronicle where we are from his perspective on the map of awakening
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.120]  fear versus love uh and david i don't ever do pre interviews with you so much is happening but
[01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:38.240]  things are becoming so clear to those of us that are awakening it's always a process of always
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:43.360]  still awakening more i wouldn't say i'm awake but compared to those that are in deep sleep we are
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:49.520]  certainly on fire with the awakening out of the gates what is front and center on david ikes radar
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:58.720]  well a lot of things really uh alex uh not least sitting in uh britain this summer uh we have a
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:07.920]  nightmare of um illuminati satanic rituals called celebrations of the queen's 60th year on the throne
[01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:13.040]  and the olympics and all that stuff and it's all going on uh simultaneously i mean the the queen
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:19.040]  stuff has died down a bit now but the olympics is coming so that's a major part of it it's you know the
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:26.160]  the symbolism is just an open book to anyone who studied it what's what's been going on but you
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.560]  you bring it you know an interesting point up there about um people awakening and people not
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:39.520]  awakening and it absolutely fits with what i've been saying and writing for years about the nature
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:49.920]  of the way we experience reality for me we have um what i call body mind which is that which basically
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:57.280]  experiences the world uh through the conscious mind of the five senses but we are in our infinite
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:04.880]  self consciousness awareness that is beyond this reality of the five senses and the idea
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:14.320]  in a non manipulated non suppressed and twisted distorted inverted world we would have
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.720]  uh the connection and the experience of the five senses would be in this world in this reality in
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:25.760]  this frequency band we call visible light the electromagnetic field but we would not be totally
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:34.320]  of it because we would have a connection and an influence from uh levels of our awareness not
[01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:41.760]  some external uh guy in a space suit in a UFO the the greater level of our own consciousness
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:48.400]  which would be giving us a fix on uh from that greater perspective from the top of the hill if
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.160]  you like um of of what we're actually experiencing so you're in this world because you're interacting
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:58.160]  with it through the five senses but you're not totally of this world in terms of the way you're
[01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:07.600]  perceiving it now the whole basis of this conspiracy the foundation of it is to enslave our point of
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:14.880]  attention in the five senses in what I call body mind because then once that influence of the
[01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:22.000]  greater self has been uh silenced if you like then the only place that people are going to try to
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:27.840]  get a fix on who they are where they are and the nature of the reality they're experiencing
[01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:33.280]  is to look outward through the eyes and the ears and look at the information that's coming back at
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:38.800]  them from that direction and who is that that's the education system which has been set up
[01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:44.160]  specifically to program uh children and young people to become the uh uh non challenging
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:51.520]  non questioning slaves as adults it's the global media 24 7 in all its incredible forms now and
[01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:58.480]  expressions which is feeding us a fake version of reality and a program version of reality peer
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:03.280]  pressures doing it come from people who've been through the same system parents are doing it to
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:08.480]  children because they've been through the same programming and so it goes on and so you get
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:15.920]  locked in this this reality of little me if I have no power of I'm so limited which is where
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:22.960]  they want us but when you start to awaken you know these truisms these these phrases that we
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:30.000]  use this throw away all the time have profound truths in them like will you open your mind when
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:37.040]  you open your mind you let other levels of your awareness in and suddenly you are not only seeing
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:43.040]  things perceiving things that you you couldn't see before you're now seeing how dots connect
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:48.160]  which you couldn't see before sure because you were in the world of the dots now you're accessing
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:53.680]  a level of self that can see how the dots connect and not only that you're pulling back basically
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:58.400]  you're pulling back and seeing the larger image you're expanding your consciousness it's like the
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:06.400]  difference between standing at a wall and looking at close ranger to brick and then pulling out and
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:10.960]  realizing the brick is part of a house the house is part of a street the street is part of a town
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:16.320]  the town's part of a country the country's part of a world etc which which you see from the bigger
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:21.120]  picture and it's incredible to see the global standardization that you've talked about so much
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:28.400]  I mean this whole thing is a plan it is a plan and it is as I've been saying for years at its
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:35.280]  foundation the conspiracy is a mind game and it has to be for a simple reason the number of people
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:42.240]  in full awareness or even major awareness of what's happening and why and where where the
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:49.040]  direction's going are so tiny compared with the target population that they cannot do it physically
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:54.720]  they can in small areas with soldiers at the door and tanks in the streets yes but they cannot do
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:18:00.160]  it to seven billion people the only way they can do it and control seven billion is to get them to
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:06.160]  perceive reality perceive self little little me no power and all the rest it's all a magician's trick
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:10.400]  that's what the big that's what the big government buildings are about it's what the black uniforms
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:16.720]  it's what the black uniforms are about it's what this idea in in all the dramas and shows about
[01:18:16.720 --> 01:18:22.880]  superheroes ever the general public are cowardly and weak and pathetic only supermen can get something
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:28.800]  done and now I go out and look at the public they're so incredibly timid from just the way they were
[01:18:28.800 --> 01:18:34.240]  20 30 years ago when I was in high school and college I mean I'm not some tough guy I'm not
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:40.160]  some adventurer people think it's bold to go hang up posters against the government now that's
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:48.960]  nothing I mean this is ridiculous yeah I mean this this is very much a time of a fork in the road
[01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:55.680]  and which you know fork we take is completely in our power to decide but there's a fork in the
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:02.080]  road between those that are getting pulled more and more into the five senses and the the narrow
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:07.920]  myopic perception of reality and personal power and those that are awakening to the opposite
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:14.640]  and what happens when you awaken to that greater self is something else happens which you kind of
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:21.760]  alluded to earlier which is that you start to get energized because the more that we are
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:30.240]  imprisoned and enslaved in the bubble that bubble is a bubble of energy as well as a
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:36.320]  bubble of awareness and thus it constantly limits the amount of energy that we're actually working
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:42.880]  with when you open your mind and let consciousness in with that comes not only greater insight and
[01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:49.680]  greater awareness but what comes with it is greater actual energy and vibrance and vitality
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:56.400]  because of what we're letting in well said day that Ike let's look at what's happening in the
[01:19:56.400 --> 01:20:03.840]  five sense world straight ahead and beyond I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:09.680]  I was eating I was lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally starving
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:15.200]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins and as soon as I had that I immediately
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:20.560]  could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied now there are hundreds of great

[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:11.040]  strange days have found us my friends they've come to destroy us all right i want to talk with
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:16.720]  david ike in the short segment long segments coming up about the in-game master plan i always
[01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:21.360]  written about it he's talked about he's got a new book coming out and i agree with a lot of his analysis
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.040]  about you know the nature of these people whether they're delusional or not who they think they are
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:30.080]  what they're into the occult the fact that they see us as animals the fact that they love suffering
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:38.000]  and pain they're not like a normal person it's a guild of psychopaths and then some they certainly
[01:24:38.000 --> 01:24:43.920]  believe what david ike says they believe now whether that is the case or not whether they
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:48.560]  are what they think they are the point is these people are out of their minds they are totally
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:54.160]  and completely out of their minds and involved in eugenics poisoning our food and water on record
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:58.240]  david this stuff's all coming out now the rockefeller documents the un's announcing
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:03.360]  they want to reduce population time magazine newsweek are saying kill old people kill children
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:10.080]  up to age three they're trying to get everybody just to accept pure evil that every culture knows
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.000]  as bad as good and say that good is bad and they're now coming out in autopsy reports i saw a few
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:20.240]  months ago where most people that are now are having autopsies done they're finding nanotech in the
[01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:26.480]  brain uh that's in a lot of the processed foods they've got designer viruses to try to make us
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:31.440]  submit that quote make us not be angry anymore that literally eat parts of our brain that's
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:37.360]  mainstream news so how do we stand up against that these super weapons these things they're
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:41.680]  about to deploy and are already testing on us because you talk about consciousness everything
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:46.240]  they do now is targeted at the unconscious that's why if you're somewhat awake it's cartoonishly
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:51.440]  ridiculous but for those that are in this trance state they're believing everything the magician
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:56.400]  tells them i mean i'm babbling here but you get where i'm going with this what is their master plan
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:26:01.120]  what is the technocracy the drones the control grid what is it all about where do they want to
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:11.280]  take us with this well the the thing is about um mind body and consciousness is it's my feeling
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:17.200]  very strongly after nearly a quarter of a century of researching this full time that they have a
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:24.640]  frequency range which they are if you like that's their home stadium and it's basically the frequency
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:30.240]  range of body mind it's the five senses and and a bit deeper into the subconscious from there
[01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:37.520]  when people become truly not awake um you know it was a good point you made earlier and as a
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:44.640]  point i make all the time none of us are awake because um the potential of full awakeness uh
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:50.400]  which is to be all there is has been and ever can be in full awareness uh is rather difficult
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.000]  through these body computer biological body computers that we call we call the human body
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:02.240]  which are are filtering and they're they're full of programs to filter and our our suit interface
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:09.600]  is limited yeah very uh but but you know within that limitation you can become massively more
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:17.360]  aware and massively more conscious um than than humanity is beyond imagination more conscious
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:21.840]  and once you enter those states you're no longer playing away from home you're no longer playing
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:28.640]  in their stadium not only can you uh see things that you you can't see through the five senses
[01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:34.560]  because it's basically looking you know through the wrong end of a telescope when you get caught in
[01:27:34.560 --> 01:27:41.680]  the in in the five senses alone um but you can you can also disconnect energetically from them
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:48.080]  and they don't have the same impact upon you like someone who is it has an awakening consciousness
[01:27:48.080 --> 01:27:54.080]  their frequency the and everyone's vibrating to a frequency that's why they want dna uh databases
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:28:01.760]  or one of the reasons is because from the dna they can um assess and and uh and find the exact
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:07.120]  frequency that someone's uh uh vibrating or broadcasting on and therefore they can fire
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:12.880]  technology like energy weapons at them and by the way the mystics said that thousands of years ago
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:19.520]  in every culture now they've proven dna is really an antenna and that 96 they said was junk is not
[01:28:19.520 --> 01:28:25.280]  junk at all well this is an important point you know it's something i've gone into very very deeply
[01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:29.040]  in in the last little while and i am today i've been sitting in this seat now for
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:34.080]  13 and a half hours uh since five o'clock this morning uh um actually working on some of that
[01:28:34.080 --> 01:28:39.920]  stuff and you know what what is happening is you know there's a russian scientific research
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:47.040]  there's some been done in america where they found a language this is so important they found a
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:53.840]  language within the 98 percent uh or whatever of what they call junk dna on non-coding dna which
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:58.880]  officially they don't know what it does but these research teams have found a language in there
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:06.320]  and it's a language that does not relate to the same coding as the the the few percent of dna
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:12.400]  that they think but not really but they think they know about and what they've also found interestingly
[01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:20.720]  is that this um this dna language reflects the patterns of human language because
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:26.880]  some people linguists and what have you that have that have looked deeply at this
[01:29:26.880 --> 01:29:32.640]  they found that the patterns of the english language the patterns of of languages from
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:39.040]  south america and and africa and etc actually although they sound different their actual
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:45.360]  patterns are the same and everything is an expression of the dna stay there this is the
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:55.600]  heaviest info we'll be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn

[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:40.480]  specifically for myself or david ike 800-259-9231 now again i've studied eugenics i wanted to
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:47.360]  discover what the globalist actually believe they're a cultist they believe that they are the
[01:33:47.360 --> 01:33:55.840]  descendants of advanced extraterrestrials they call it uh directed trans spermium and i have
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:34:03.520]  broken down the secrets of prometheus uh leaked that film that clip i did has about 500 000 views
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:08.960]  on youtube i see you know you're finding the right one uh and i'm not saying i believe this
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:20.000]  i'm saying the global controllers say this and in about the 1850s and i'm talking galton
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:26.960]  the wedgewoods the hoxleys the darwins if you go back and read and we've got all this research
[01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:33.120]  the darwins and all of them thought they were star men hd wells was just their front 50 years later
[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:38.000]  he he worked for those families on record he wanted world government a super science class
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:44.000]  getting rid of the family merging with machines they envisioned this darwin if you look it up
[01:34:44.000 --> 01:34:48.480]  believed he channeled it that's something they don't like to talk about because they want to make it
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:56.480]  non-religious no no it's religious it's totally religious and you see in as i predicted accurately
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:04.160]  because i had the script in prometheus it's really humans that seeded themselves on earth
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:08.800]  that's what the globalists believe they believe that they are made in the image of god but that
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:15.120]  they are god and that the aliens are god and that they have been genetically basically spliced
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.120]  then you can argue that's the kind of stuff that's in uh the old testament and things but the point
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:24.160]  is whether you believe this or not i don't want the new york time saying i'm saying this this is
[01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:34.160]  what the establishment believes and if you look at the ancient symbol several thousand years old
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:41.200]  the caduceus symbol i'm halfway pronouncing it right the two twisted snakes the symbol of medicine
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:47.760]  and then you look at the symbol of dna there it is now again the point is there's a lot of things
[01:35:47.760 --> 01:35:53.200]  the controllers know that the general public doesn't know but if you really study them you realize
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:58.400]  what david's saying the actual controllers themselves are enslaved and locked in and they're
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:03.440]  very into programming they're very into ritual look at the queen of england all the things they do
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.240]  the truth is they're only in power because they're ruthless they're like cancer
[01:36:08.240 --> 01:36:12.480]  doesn't mean it's dominant okay david i'm ranting you've got the floor break down
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:17.920]  what i'm getting into here now if you have any comments on prometheus well yeah well i could
[01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:23.760]  talk for i could talk for the next three or four hours um on on on this subject after researching
[01:36:23.760 --> 01:36:31.600]  it in such depth for so long and i'll give you my my fix of it after all this time um what movies
[01:36:31.600 --> 01:36:38.640]  like prometheus and so many others are doing now they're telling us um and it's a part in a big
[01:36:38.640 --> 01:36:46.080]  way about um preparing us and programming our perception to accept it that um there was
[01:36:46.080 --> 01:36:53.360]  extraterrestrial non-human intervention in human genetics um i've got a a grandson who's um he's
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:59.520]  i think he's about five no i think two yeah just just five and um i was round at his house the other
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:05.760]  day and he was reading this little book and this book was for kids of his age and it was a story
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:11.840]  about shape-shifting hybrids uh hybrid genetic people and super people and all the rest of it
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:18.560]  all the stuff that you're getting in these movies this is basically uh what happened um human genetics
[01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:27.440]  was manipulated um to turn us into a slave race and it was done by encoding junk dna non-coding
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:34.640]  dna with emotional and perception programs which if we get pulled only into the five senses and
[01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:40.400]  and the lower mind then those programs run our lives and it is quite possible people will be
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:46.000]  shocked by this but it is very possible and probably very likely it's not uncommon that
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:52.240]  people can go through their entire lives without having an original thought or emotional response
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:58.640]  that hasn't come from the dna biological software program now these bloodlines these
[01:37:58.640 --> 01:38:03.280]  so-called elite bloodlines they are different they are different because they've got a different
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:11.280]  programming they were specifically created with programs running in their junk dna which
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:17.360]  delete first of all and my goodness me this will explain a lot of things which delete the ability
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:26.160]  to manifest or feel empathy they have no ability to feel empathy or to put themselves in the
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:34.000]  feelings of those who they target their victims none at all 3000 dead on 9 11 pepper bombing uh
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:40.640]  triply not a problem making people uh kids starve in africa in a world of plenty not a problem there
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:48.000]  is no emotional consequence they cannot decode it they cannot filter it and the other thing
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:56.320]  that's in other things that's in their dna is that it is programmed to worship these entities
[01:38:56.320 --> 01:39:04.480]  as gods and this is what satanism is about satanism is making human sacrifice to the gods now who
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:11.920]  are the gods they operate outside of human sight which is pathetically narrow what scientists
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.920]  call visible light which is the only frequency range that we can decode into what we see as a
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:24.560]  a a world of the conscious mind is so tiny it's unbelievable even mainstream science says that
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:32.160]  the electromagnetic spectrum is about 0.005 of what exists in the universe in mass matter and
[01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:38.000]  all the rest of it some people scientists say it's a bit wider than that but but not by much
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:46.080]  and visible light is only a tiny fraction of that 0.005 or a little bit more in in the eyes
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:52.800]  of some scientists so we're actually basically blind and now i've got a a quote here from an
[01:39:52.800 --> 01:40:00.160]  article on dna which says this from the characteristic form of this giant molecule a wound double helix
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:07.200]  the dna represents an ideal electromagnetic antenna on one hand it is elongated and thus a blade
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:12.720]  which can take up very well electrical pulses on the other hand seen from above it has the
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:21.360]  form of a ring and thus is a very magnetical antenna so we are picking up like a radio or
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:28.240]  anything that's a receiver transmitter we are receiving and transmitting on the frequency
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:36.720]  that the receiver transmitters are tuned to and what the idea is and this is what the the impact
[01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:43.440]  of this radiation agenda of the mobile phone agenda of the food and drink chemical agenda
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:49.520]  but probably of the chem trail agenda too in part everything has many reasons is actually to
[01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:57.120]  manipulate the dna so that it receives and transmits on a narrow and narrower band which
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:41:02.160]  means that we are bringing into our awareness our daily perception less and less and less
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.600]  and that's where we're conscious so these are psychological warfare overlay compulsions
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.160]  and and you know the globalist again all i know is this david and this is what gives
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:16.080]  some credibility of what you're saying certainly their psychology is what you say they believe
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:21.360]  what you say i've studied them that's why they do these rituals they in fact they just don't feel
[01:41:21.360 --> 01:41:26.640]  empathy they actually enjoy hurting innocence that's why every culture is run by a weird secret
[01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:30.960]  sect that demands you bring your babies to them so they can chop them up cut their hearts out
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:35.280]  throw them into pits to idols eat them you know i mean that's not normal people why does every
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.280]  society manifest that group regardless this is what we face with this system but just to correct
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:50.800]  myself it's not directed panspermia i was saying directed transpermia it's directed panspermia
[01:41:50.800 --> 01:41:55.760]  and folks look this up this is in the big scientific books you know the roiders new york times the
[01:41:55.760 --> 01:42:02.320]  huxleys the wedgewoods 160 years ago this whole school comes out and says we're going to discover
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:10.960]  this dna we're going to and they created all the modern sciences psychology uh they uh biometrics
[01:42:10.960 --> 01:42:18.800]  is 160 years old everything we are today modern medicine this group out of the british empire
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:24.000]  if you study it it always leads back there they created this modern world and that's how
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:29.440]  they could write about atomic weapons 50 years before they were out they could talk about dna
[01:42:29.440 --> 01:42:35.600]  100 years before they discovered it how advanced is the secret technology they've got because in
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:42.800]  deep research of their own writings there is no way they just envisioned all of this they what's
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:52.240]  happening well what it is is directed information that's what it is because you know we see and
[01:42:52.240 --> 01:42:56.560]  this is you know when you get into quantum physics and the deeper levels of reality
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:01.120]  what we see is a physical world it's not a physical world at all it's a holographic world
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:06.080]  illusory physical and it has many levels it has the holographic level it has a digital level
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:12.240]  this was very well symbolized in the matrix movies when uh neo overcame death towards the end and
[01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:17.200]  saw everything as digital and all the digital things on the screens of the computers of the
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:22.240]  matrix that that was the digital level being symbolized of this reality there's an electrical
[01:43:22.240 --> 01:43:27.200]  electromagnetic level and the foundation of it in terms of its construct of everything
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:32.000]  is a waveform level some people call it the vibrational level but the waveform level and
[01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:40.240]  therefore everything we see in uh the holographic so-called physical world whether it's uh food or
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:49.120]  drink or or any of it is actually in its base form a waveform information energy so what when you
[01:43:49.120 --> 01:43:58.320]  consume um rubbish in food and chemicals in food and drink you are actually absorbing into your
[01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:07.440]  energy field distorted um and twisted um vibrational energetic information fields and
[01:44:07.440 --> 01:44:14.320]  that's the level it's going on alex because that distortion that energetic twisting um distorts and
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:20.320]  twists the dna which it interacts with and thus changes and distorts the way that it decodes
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.240]  reality now these particular bloodlines they have a different dna setup which is one of the reasons
[01:44:26.240 --> 01:44:31.120]  they think they're so bloody special which is actually decoding reality in a different way
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:36.000]  not just with the lack of empathy but they're actually able to access things in terms of their
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:41.200]  awareness of things that are beyond what humans can this has done been done specifically so that
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:47.200]  they can they can be in a situation of of power and and and all the rest of it and so what they're
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:53.520]  doing in their rituals and and what have you is they're interacting with these gods i mean i've
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:58.560]  talked to endless people around the world who have actually participated in these rituals
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:04.560]  most of them against their will and they all tell the same story about how some of these
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:10.320]  horrific looking entities are manifest in the rituals because of the energetic fields
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:17.360]  that the rituals are designed to generate and when you go um into this whole uh area going
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:24.560]  way back in history whenever these entities are talked about by the ancients one thing always
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:31.360]  is a many things but this thing is always there invariably they demanded human sacrifice
[01:45:31.360 --> 01:45:38.160]  crater mutwa a high zulu shaman who's in his 90s now a library of knowledge of ancient
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:46.080]  african law and and legends he says that the legends say very clearly that cannibalism was
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:53.040]  introduced by these entities because they demanded it and you know you know from from what you've
[01:45:53.040 --> 01:45:58.320]  researched and and what have you and others that research this these people do drink blood and eat
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:05.680]  the flesh they do and what's happening is because these entities are operating at a different frequency
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:14.080]  outside of visible light they can absorb energy in a different way to to weaken when we express
[01:46:14.080 --> 01:46:22.480]  emotion for instance or fear or terror you see someone's body language their face everything
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:28.880]  expressing that terror but you can't see the energy that that is generating they operate
[01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:35.200]  in frequency bands where which are in sync with that energy so they can absorb it never mind see
[01:46:35.200 --> 01:46:41.920]  it and this is what the a thing is don't get human fear collective and uh individual human fear
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:47.760]  so the more wars there are the more uh economic crashes with all the emotional fear and and and
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:53.600]  what that come from that all the more illness and death there are they're feeding off it they
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.760]  feed off that and david you're absolutely on target with this because if you look at everybody
[01:46:59.760 --> 01:47:05.600]  knows types that are psychic vampires they love pain they love to upset things that's the state
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:13.680]  they like to get into how many university studies thousands have proven the sixth sense where you're
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:18.320]  at a restaurant you feel somebody intensely looking at you you turn around and there are their eyes
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:26.240]  that has been proven in double blind studies this is what the controllers are aware of but as you
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:32.400]  said the ruling elite every evidence is there that they themselves are a minion class and are
[01:47:32.400 --> 01:47:39.280]  basically addled and blind and don't know what's going on i mean it's and again folks the mystery
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:45.120]  the majesty of being on a planet in space and all the incredible things around us and we're worried
[01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:51.760]  about bill clinton and obama and mit romney and dancing with the stars everything is about
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:58.720]  narrowing what we're doing regardless of what you take away from this that is a fact and every
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:04.400]  culture was taken over by psychopathic killers david ike well this is a another area that i'd
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:10.400]  like to talk about which is very relevant to all this and explains a lot more things you mentioned
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:15.600]  there about feeling the eyes of someone and turning around and they're looking at you you're
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:20.640]  obviously not feeling their eyes you're feeling their energy field for a simple reason there's a
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:27.680]  great phrase which is absolutely profoundly true energy flows where attention goes and so when you
[01:48:27.680 --> 01:48:34.080]  someone is focusing their attention on you they are focusing an energetic connection to you which
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:39.280]  that attention generates thus you feel that energetic channel that attention and you turn
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:46.560]  around and they're looking at you now this brings us into a massively important area to understand
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:52.240]  why these people put symbols and what have you like they're all seeing eye and the flame and
[01:48:52.240 --> 01:48:57.680]  all the other things all around us and why the buildings are built in certain ways and all the
[01:48:57.680 --> 01:49:06.880]  rest of it and the power of television energy flows where attention goes and what they do is
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:16.080]  that they create these symbols which resonate energetically in frequency terms to these entities
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:22.800]  the same frequency of the energy field is vibrating that those energies by those entities
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:32.880]  vibrate to therefore when people are manipulated to focus their attention upon a symbol of these
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:39.200]  entities then there is an energetic channel generated between the the the person observing
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:45.680]  and focusing and the entity just as you feel that same situation in a restaurant when it's an
[01:49:45.680 --> 01:49:51.280]  electrical connection and they're not just sucking power out of everybody like the matrix
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:56.960]  they're also able to send information back it well energy is information every time I say
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:02.880]  energy I'm saying information the whole universe is information decoded and encoded information
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:08.800]  everything is and it's manipulating that information that decides what is encoded therefore
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:16.240]  what is decoded that this whole conspiracy is founded on so when you come to where I am now
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:23.440]  and the summer in London which is a major major center of the earth's energy grid the the earth's
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:31.680]  this is a giant worship fest of the illuminati yeah but why why why why is the illuminati so
[01:50:31.680 --> 01:50:37.280]  and the family's so centered in London why are they so focused in the city of London
[01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:46.240]  and and why the answer is because they know and this is why this these these pathetically small
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:53.120]  islands have had such a gigantic impact upon the world it's because they came here a long time ago
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:58.160]  and settled that one of that one of their centers of operation there gotta go to break dead we're
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:02.720]  gonna come back with this we'll also talk about all these hi this is alex jones did you know
[01:51:02.720 --> 01:51:07.200]  that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:11.680]  circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than
[01:51:11.680 --> 01:51:16.160]  silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:20.800]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put
[01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:27.040]  together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce
[01:51:27.040 --> 01:51:32.000]  an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:36.720]  seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[01:51:36.720 --> 01:51:42.800]  full acre crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed

[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.840]  research we're going to ask him that moment when he finishes his point by the way symbolism is
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:21.040]  important that's why i'm saying hang up posters everywhere exposing obama as a dictator we have
[01:54:21.040 --> 01:54:25.280]  a green link to some of the videos that are coming in in the posters at info wars dot com on the
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:31.680]  right hand top navigation bar stop dictator obama info wars dot com also you support the broadcast
[01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:36.720]  when you buy books videos t-shirts at info wars dot com or info warshop dot com here's our newest
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:45.280]  shirt end the tsa and next time i fly i'm gonna videotape it too i'm going to wear this through
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:49.680]  there and i'm gonna see if they get in my face see i'm not scared of them getting in my face
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:55.680]  i want to draw them out they the system wants it all to be incremental boiling us slowly they
[01:54:55.680 --> 01:55:03.440]  don't want us to respond to them so the new shirt in the tsa you want to shoot video yourself with
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:07.120]  this i mean they get in your face say yeah i don't want to be grope i don't like you putting
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:11.440]  yourself in the way of travel but you don't like it you know don't mess with my first amendment
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:15.840]  you want a civil rights violation lawsuit you're not allowed to ask me about my shirt
[01:55:17.760 --> 01:55:24.560]  bunch of pervs the point is hey they ought to name all these airports jerry sandusky international
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:29.120]  okay that's what they're into and that's what all this is about psychologists had meant this is
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:34.240]  training kids for this which i expose this is another thing these psychic vampires do david i
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:38.640]  want to get into all these zombie attacks that are starting where people just become total animals
[01:55:38.640 --> 01:55:42.640]  now and because i guess from all the zombie programming on television when they get into
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:48.960]  subconscious mode start trying to eat people uh we see this in other cases in history when things
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:54.560]  start degenerating down to these lower bestial frequencies as you call them david please continue
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:02.480]  well if i could just finish the the point uh from a few minutes ago it these rituals in
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:07.520]  britain and london this summer the olympics and the diamond jubilee and what have you
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:15.360]  they're not obviously selected by random accident it's been done and prepared for for a long time
[01:56:15.360 --> 01:56:22.720]  because the earth has an energy field yes and it has an energy grid an energy grid of force lines
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:27.360]  which have called meridian lines or lay lines or whatever this is this is a grid of energy a grid
[01:56:27.360 --> 01:56:34.080]  of information and where these lines cross a vortex is created where lots and lots of these lines
[01:56:34.080 --> 01:56:41.360]  cross an enormous vortex is created and these vortexes are interdimensional gateways because
[01:56:41.360 --> 01:56:48.000]  the vortex spins several realities in the same vault and i got in a rock to folks even if you
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.160]  don't believe this the elite in their own writings believe this that's why they build
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:57.280]  these stone hinges all over the world at these sites ancient cultures thought something was
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:04.960]  going on and the elites of today travel and build in those areas and london and the british aisles
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:12.800]  is one of the great centers if perhaps the great center of this entire global web of information
[01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:20.000]  of energetic uh uh information and and these lay lines vortexes thus what they do in britain what
[01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:27.440]  they do in london in terms of rituals and and and which is the manipulation of this energy field
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:34.000]  impacts itself on the entire global energy field because that's the heart center from which it all
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:40.160]  flows out across the world and what we're experiencing now this summer and we're in the mid-staff
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:47.520]  is a massive double ritual to do exactly that and of course one of the especially with the
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:52.160]  olympics but also with the diamond shoes they admit that's an olympic hitler created it with
[01:57:52.160 --> 01:58:01.440]  the rings and all of it yeah and and um it's the flame and the flame is also uh has the potential
[01:58:01.440 --> 01:58:07.920]  to be an interdimensional doorway it's the nature of fire this is why in their satanic rituals um
[01:58:07.920 --> 01:58:14.560]  and bohemian grove they have fires they use fire because they know that it's satanism they just
[01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:19.520]  caught a guy doing a few weeks ago they burn a child that burning is very important it's it's
[01:58:19.520 --> 01:58:24.480]  the fire is very much uh at the center of it because they know it's an interdimensional
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:30.560]  portal or potentially so and that's why when a lot of people and psychics and others they look
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:36.400]  into fire they see things they see other dimensional things because it's through the fire and it at the
[01:58:36.400 --> 01:58:47.040]  end stay there back in one minute you are listening to gcn visit gcnlive.com today
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:55.040]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:58:55.040 --> 01:59:00.240]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:59:00.240 --> 01:59:05.120]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:10.720]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:59:10.720 --> 01:59:15.760]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now
[01:59:15.760 --> 01:59:20.880]  new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:25.040]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.760]  weather-related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:34.160]  insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:40.480]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:46.400]  that's mysolarbackup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com
[01:59:46.400 --> 01:59:50.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[01:59:50.000 --> 02:00:01.520]  waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm radio network
[02:00:05.360 --> 02:00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:21.680]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:28.160]  okay we got one little short segment here with david ike than another segment and it's the next
[02:00:28.160 --> 02:00:34.080]  segment that i'll go to james scott scott collin and steve all these kids those five six calls
[02:00:34.080 --> 02:00:40.640]  david ike david uh amazing discussions we're having right now but but finishing up with
[02:00:40.640 --> 02:00:46.800]  what's happening right now in england or or the uk uh but then the end game i mean is the end game
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:52.800]  just keep mining us keep controlling us merges with machines you know just use us as as as body
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:57.600]  parts that's what the elite openly say that the future doesn't need us they want machines now
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:01.840]  they want to get rid of most of us i mean why do the technocrats want to do that regardless of
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:07.120]  who they really are and what is the end game if no one opposed them if this big awakening didn't
[02:01:07.120 --> 02:01:15.040]  happen well okay just just finished finished very quickly the point is that this great focus on on
[02:01:15.040 --> 02:01:20.160]  the olympic flame and the flames were very much part of the diamond jubilee celebrations that
[02:01:20.160 --> 02:01:27.440]  focus creates an energetic connection with the flame and thus when you have the olympics with
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:33.440]  its its audience of billions that can be trawled from from from all over the world because energy
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:39.760]  has no time or space it just it just is i mean you know distance doesn't matter the connection
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:46.800]  matters and thus um london is going through and this is very relevant to the entire world a massive
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:54.160]  ongoing satanic ritual through this summer to change the nature of the earth's energy field and
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:59.360]  that's why i oh one of the reasons i've got this event at wembley in london on the 20th of october
[02:01:59.360 --> 02:02:05.120]  to get thousands and thousands of people together for a whole day to negate and and and flip this
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:11.520]  thing because we can do that with far more powerful than they are in terms of the end game um well
[02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:18.960]  it's been a process um alex of gathering more and more and more and more and more control of
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:25.680]  human perception and the the next stage which they want is is the cyborgs it's and we're being
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:31.280]  prepared for that with the movies with swats and ego and all these other things um to actually start
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:36.880]  to introduce um technology that we call technology because they see the human body as biological
[02:02:36.880 --> 02:02:42.880]  technology they don't see it as a as we see it and but to introduce the technology that we can
[02:02:42.880 --> 02:02:48.320]  understand to it and that technology will externally give them more and more control the microchips
[02:02:48.320 --> 02:02:53.840]  are classic but there are other things that they want as well nano check they put into us you name
[02:02:53.840 --> 02:03:01.680]  it yeah yeah and and and and so um it's like uh a road which is getting more and more and more
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:08.560]  extreme in every way it's like walking down a a road or a freeway and it gets narrow and
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:14.000]  narrow and narrow and narrow until it's just a path this is what they want to do to us in
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:21.360]  multiple multiple ways for for for the major reason which is absolute mental emotional
[02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:27.200]  and what we call physical control and that is all done through control of our perception
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:33.200]  and the more bits a kit that they can put in because they know the the bodies of biological
[02:03:33.200 --> 02:03:38.640]  computer the more access they have to externally manipulators not least the microchip that's the
[02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:45.680]  biggest thing to say no to at any price because you know they're talking now about doing brain
[02:03:45.680 --> 02:03:51.360]  computer interfacing where you can sit at your computer and what you think comes up on the screen
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:56.960]  and what you think the the to do the computer does now it's not just google tracking you now
[02:03:56.960 --> 02:04:02.400]  they're in your brain that's going to be two-way yeah that's not just that's a possible rather
[02:04:02.400 --> 02:04:06.880]  that whole technology that whole connection it's possible because although the the two
[02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:12.160]  computers are massively different in terms of advancement they are actually connecting two
[02:04:12.160 --> 02:04:17.360]  forms of a computer one a very advanced biological computer which has the ability to think for
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:21.840]  itself that's what the immune system is doing and and the other is by the way david i'm going to go
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:27.040]  get it during the break airman article about this on monday uh actually sunday
[02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:33.920]  mit and big think tanks are actually calling it a genetic overwrite and and call our brain
[02:04:33.920 --> 02:04:38.880]  a biological computer and say they're just going to take it over uh with this new synthetic
[02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:46.080]  genetic system so they're already invading with all of this with their with their nanotech they
[02:04:46.080 --> 02:04:51.280]  call it biotech but it's really nanotech this is a total war we're under well they're right back
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:56.080]  with david ike amazing david ike dot com he's got that big event in wimbley can't wait to see that
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:06.400]  hi folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about the silver lungs generator
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:11.360]  now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[02:05:11.360 --> 02:05:16.800]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first
[02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:22.000]  line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:27.840]  respiratory system with your self produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:33.200]  silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation threatening
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:39.120]  the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with
[02:05:39.120 --> 02:05:44.480]  the silver lungs generator very easy to follow step by step instructions are provided making

[02:05:56.640 --> 02:06:04.640]  sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks adding poison to your water and laughing as
[02:06:04.640 --> 02:06:09.440]  you get sick and die start purifying your water with pro pure my friends i've done a lot of
[02:06:09.440 --> 02:06:15.600]  research and the best gravity filter out there bar none is pro pure and it's available discounted
[02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:21.360]  at info wars dot com its filters are silver and pregnant to prevent bacterial growth there's no
[02:06:21.360 --> 02:06:27.840]  priming required it's nsf 42 certified optional fluoride filters can reduce fluoride up to 95
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:33.680]  percent easy to set up and use doesn't require electricity purify water from lake streams ponds
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:39.040]  and wells this filter system leaves in beneficial minerals which is key save money by not buying
[02:06:39.040 --> 02:06:43.760]  bottled water and avoid bpa that leaches from the plastic pro pure is the best gravity fed
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:49.120]  filter out there it's what my family uses info wars dot com already has the lowest price on
[02:06:49.120 --> 02:06:54.000]  pro pure but if you add the promo code water at checkout you get an additional 10 percent off

[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:07.040]  the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[02:07:07.040 --> 02:07:12.000]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold
[02:07:12.000 --> 02:07:16.160]  it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[02:07:16.160 --> 02:07:20.640]  that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science have put together the
[02:07:20.640 --> 02:07:26.880]  perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless
[02:07:26.880 --> 02:07:31.760]  supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family and here's the best part these seeds have
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:36.800]  not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:43.120]  crisis garden so visit them today at survival seed bank dot com that's survival seed bank dot com
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:55.280]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365 remember in a real crisis non-hybrid seeds
[02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:59.360]  are the ultimate barter item this is alex jones for survival seed bank dot com
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:15.280]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:08:21.120 --> 02:08:28.720]  alas poor york i knew him a ratio a fellow of infinite jest of most excellent fancy he has
[02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:34.560]  bore me on his back a thousand times and now abhorred in my imagination it is
[02:08:36.400 --> 02:08:41.840]  my gorge rises at it all and that is william shakespeare
[02:08:43.840 --> 02:08:51.280]  it was really a composite of different riders for an illuminous guild riding in hamlet when
[02:08:51.280 --> 02:08:59.680]  they had dug up one grave to bury someone and found the skull of someone that took care of
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:06.880]  them as a child the court jester and again you'll learn next monday with a special video
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:12.880]  news piece why i have a real human skull here at the office and why i have that crocodilian
[02:09:12.880 --> 02:09:23.200]  65 million year old saltwater crocodile skull david ike is our guest and i really want to thank
[02:09:23.200 --> 02:09:27.520]  david for coming on david i want to go to calls as promised but very briefly i want to get you
[02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:32.320]  back on and talk about this you're having a big event to counter the globalist propaganda fest
[02:09:32.320 --> 02:09:37.520]  you're having it a big center so it's going to get a lot of media attention very exciting
[02:09:37.520 --> 02:09:41.360]  to get people thinking tell folks about that i guess they find out at david ike dot com
[02:09:41.360 --> 02:09:48.480]  yeah um it's wembley arena which is a massive arena in london with the potential of 11 000
[02:09:48.480 --> 02:09:54.000]  people and uh but we can have anything between five and a half to 11 um we're going to comfortably
[02:09:54.000 --> 02:09:58.800]  get five and a half and how many more than that we get depends on how many people decide to come
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:06.000]  of course but um it's to do a number of things first of all what i mentioned uh earlier which
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:12.160]  is to get all these people of like mind together and create a very different and massively powerful
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.520]  energy field in the same city that all this rubbish is going on of the opposite kind through the
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.600]  summer you should stream it live on the internet during key times too so people all the world can
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:27.280]  watch they can't make it well we'll we'll see we'll see what we can do um uh but um you know
[02:10:27.280 --> 02:10:32.000]  the more people that can get actually in the arena uh the better because that that that energy is
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:38.400]  very very important but the other thing is that you mentioned there um to get a very very large
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:43.920]  number of people together to hear information of this kind and i'll be talking for about nine
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:51.760]  hours is revolutionary yeah but the point is that what i wanted to make a statement look the world's
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:57.440]  not like it was before it's changing why are all these massive numbers of people coming together
[02:10:57.440 --> 02:11:02.480]  to hear this information what's going on and and as you say the media will not be able to
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:08.080]  ignore it and uh it's uh i think it's it's it's it's the most important thing i've done for a
[02:11:08.080 --> 02:11:12.560]  very long time it is well october's hurtling towards us so let's have you back up in a few
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:17.280]  months to really get into it in detail uh let's go ahead and go to some calls as promised james
[02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:21.760]  in texas you're on with david ike he certainly gets your thinking and that's something the globalists
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:27.760]  don't like so he's good uh go ahead james you're on the air hey two days ago i was os now i'm just
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:32.320]  james i've declared declared myself a soft kill and it is the most freeing thing that you can
[02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:39.120]  ever do to yourself just declare yourself a soft kill and go on and just get after this and david
[02:11:39.120 --> 02:11:45.200]  ike to you i would say to the five thousand five hundred that you have show up have them be conduits
[02:11:45.200 --> 02:11:49.440]  have them accept the energy that we're all gonna have more than that i mean my energy the energy
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:53.520]  of waking up and going out and reaching out showing the numbers do you have a question for david ike
[02:11:53.520 --> 02:12:00.880]  sir the the question i have for david ike is why it is basically downing on what he's already been
[02:12:00.880 --> 02:12:05.920]  saying you know why can't we walk through walls the reason is what he's saying i mean he's absolutely
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:10.960]  correct and i just wanted to piggyback on that and get out my point is the elites believe in all the
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:15.600]  things david ike is saying whether it's totally true or not this is the real deal i appreciate
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:22.800]  your call james we gotta move quick the thing very quickly that you know we live in a holographic
[02:12:22.800 --> 02:12:27.200]  world which is not physical but i'm sitting in a chair and i'm not falling on the floor
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:34.880]  and we think in the by the conscious minds perception that it is something physical
[02:12:34.880 --> 02:12:38.720]  that's stopping me walking through the wall or falling through the chair but it's actually
[02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:43.600]  electromagnetic resistance of two different electromagnetic fields or types of field but
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:48.000]  when we decode it through it appears to have solidity that that's that's that's the way and if
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:56.000]  you can get yourself into a mode and energetic where you can sink with these other fields then
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:00.320]  you can walk through apparently inanimate objects but it's a hell of a hell of a challenge well
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.400]  that's what that's what the pentagons working on teleportation they now actually been able to do
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:08.880]  that let's go ahead and talk to scott in florida scott you're on the air go ahead we gotta move
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:15.600]  quick folks okay hey um uh it's a great honor to talk to you david a great honor to talk to you alec
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:21.440]  um david i'm i'm 21 years old right now i literally opened up your first book in 2005
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:25.840]  in my junior year of high school and i've been following you ever since following your research
[02:13:25.840 --> 02:13:30.000]  my quick question is pretty much in in your book which is the first book that i read uh
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:34.080]  infinite love is the only truth everything else is an illusion you pretty much go into saying how
[02:13:34.080 --> 02:13:42.880]  purpose controls us and then you go on to say how um like in the end it's um purpose controls us but
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:49.600]  um it's what defines us but you have to go beyond purpose and um in the end most people have no
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:54.160]  purpose they're spectators they're not even conscious they're not even real and the globalists
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:59.200]  know that they're biological androids that respond to the programming that's 100 true david
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:04.000]  oh yeah did you want to finish that question scott
[02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:09.440]  point was that when you go when you have a purpose against something you create
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:15.920]  like um you know an opposite something for the something for it to be um conduit though
[02:14:15.920 --> 02:14:22.960]  yeah the point about the manipulation is that we create our experienced reality from our sense
[02:14:22.960 --> 02:14:31.040]  of reality that one creates the other um and and we can do that directly independently but what the
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:36.960]  whole conspiracy is about by these people that understand this process they are trying to get
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:44.000]  us manipulate us by manipulating our sense of reality they know that they that through that
[02:14:44.000 --> 02:14:50.320]  we will um the tail wagging the dog gotta move quick can experience reality and that means
[02:14:50.320 --> 02:14:57.360]  that they're constantly trying to uh uh program our our our sense of reality our perception of
[02:14:57.360 --> 02:15:01.760]  reality because they know that becomes the reality of the experience and therefore what they're trying
[02:15:01.760 --> 02:15:07.520]  to do is give us their perception of of reality which is we are little people we are limited we
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:12.640]  have no power and that's the world we live in if we accept that nonsense yeah we gotta move quick
[02:15:12.640 --> 02:15:15.920]  or we won't be able to get to any more of these calls we only got about five minutes kareem in
[02:15:15.920 --> 02:15:25.040]  london you're on the air go ahead hey hi doing alex um basically well i live in strafford i live
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:30.960]  where they host in the olympics and uh basically word on the street is that there's a lot of rumors
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:35.920]  going on in what so having listened to your show and i know you've touched on there a couple of times
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:40.560]  but is there anything that you could basically advise the residents or the people that live
[02:15:40.560 --> 02:15:46.000]  was in the bottom there's a lot of talk about stage terror attacks but david you know is over there
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:50.720]  with you uh i i don't know that's kind of happened they're going to use it as a police state um
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:56.000]  conditioning operation a big ritual of police state uh david your comments to him i mean i would get
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:16:01.200]  out of there for the olympics wouldn't you well if i could i would yeah i mean obviously you know
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:06.400]  people struggling for money and and stuff like that i often don't have a choice of to get out
[02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:11.120]  but if they could have they got friends i'd get out of there um for no other reason than than
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:15.920]  than the energy things that are going on there and in the unseen whether they'll actually come up
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:21.120]  with a false flag event when all the world's watching well who knows but i tell you this when
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:30.640]  it was announced uh years and years ago now that london were seeking to get the 2012 olympic games
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:37.600]  it was a gimme 2012 i don't agree with all the 2012 stuff uh you know that has been talked about
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:45.200]  but it's a focus year and they've made it a focus year that and london was so synchronistic so symbiotic
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:49.920]  in their relationship there was no way that london wasn't going to get it so it's there for a massive
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:54.880]  reason it might be just energetic but it might be more than that exactly everybody can just see
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:17:00.640]  the propaganda and also sense something big thank you so much kareem uh scott in ohio moving quick
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:07.440]  here go ahead uh hello alex and uh david uh i'd like a quick question um have you heard of lytha
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.320]  the return of darkness ceremony it's supposed to be held at kimball castle tonight or aka
[02:17:12.320 --> 02:17:17.440]  cherokee ranch in colorado have you heard about that i mean i've heard of those places out there
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:21.360]  but i never really seen any proof bohemian grove does do rituals because i've infiltrated and
[02:17:21.360 --> 02:17:30.240]  documented david well i mean it's the summer solstice today isn't it um uh the 21st and uh
[02:17:30.240 --> 02:17:35.040]  they the the the druids were at stonehenge this morning they did nothing negative about that
[02:17:35.040 --> 02:17:41.200]  it's their belief system good luck to them but um you know it's no accident that prince william was
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:48.160]  induced to um be born on the summer solstice so that they play with these energies these energies
[02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:53.120]  these astronomical energies and astrological energies all the time they believe in it i mean
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:58.480]  all these elites are into the occult it's not debatable rituals will be going on today elite
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:02.320]  rituals all over the world in the different countries absolutely have you heard of the
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:07.840]  specific castle he mentioned no but i mean it's got castle after it and they love castles i mean
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:13.200]  that they they've got their european castles all over the place i mean they just love love the castles
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:21.680]  and the the the palaces and all that because part of their genetics um it has an absolute obsession
[02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:29.440]  um with hierarchy and thus they are absolutely obsessed with hierarchy and position and everyone
[02:18:29.440 --> 02:18:34.560]  in their place this is why the roth childs have run around all over the bloody place getting
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:40.240]  barons and lords in front of their names they're obsessed with it and the royal family of course
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:45.440]  are a classic yeah it shows how primitive they are uh look at this fidelity investments funding
[02:18:45.440 --> 02:18:52.160]  synthetic biology takeover of life info wars dot com lab creator artificial species lot number life
[02:18:52.160 --> 02:18:57.840]  50 to 1 financial firm says fidelity is telling their investors they're going to overwrite as if
[02:18:57.840 --> 02:19:03.120]  none of us have a say as if they just say this is the future i mean this is this is madness what
[02:19:03.120 --> 02:19:08.160]  they're saying is 10 times wilder than what you're saying david yeah fidelity investments so they
[02:19:08.160 --> 02:19:13.760]  still got the uh the the pyramid as their uh as their logo they did a few years ago they certainly
[02:19:13.760 --> 02:19:18.080]  do other the shining pyramid we're out of time david promise you'll come back on the next few
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:21.760]  months another problem mates i've enjoyed it i'm gonna come say bye to you during the break thank
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:29.120]  you so much got 30 seconds closing comments david well you know just what we've talked about today
[02:19:29.120 --> 02:19:36.480]  is is is massively um encouraging because this information that they've suppressed for thousands
[02:19:36.480 --> 02:19:42.720]  of years this really you know getting really in the rabbit hole deep stuff about how they're doing it
[02:19:42.720 --> 02:19:47.440]  is is is coming out and people more and more people are opening their minds to it and thus
[02:19:47.440 --> 02:19:52.800]  once we start to get the understanding of how they're doing it we can stop them doing it it's
[02:19:52.800 --> 02:19:58.000]  when we don't know how they're doing it well said well said david ike dot com alex jones here
[02:19:58.000 --> 02:20:02.800]  we'll be back in a moment info wars dot com stay with us for a long time you've heard me talk about

[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:45.520]  just a few years 80 plus percent of world corn production gmo that creates its own pesticide
[02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:49.120]  that kills bugs so they can't eat it but you're supposed to eat it and it's okay they say

[02:28:36.000 --> 02:28:41.360]  board meetings knowing about it of course who else wants to create a scientific core

[02:33:48.240 --> 02:33:55.920]  we tend to forget the fact that the general public is not awake and that we're going to
[02:33:55.920 --> 02:34:02.160]  have to reach out to them so many emails so many calls people say oh thank you for being

[02:34:21.120 --> 02:34:26.480]  like i've been able to do thanks to listeners spreading the word about the broadcast on facebook
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:31.440]  and twitter and their email and at work and telling folks about the local am and fm stations they
[02:34:31.440 --> 02:34:40.000]  listen to i mean i'll be driving into work hour before work red light i almost always roll down
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:46.160]  the windows and go hey tune into this station in an hour you want to hear some important
[02:34:46.160 --> 02:34:50.000]  stuff for you and your family they're like what is it just believe me you don't want to miss it
[02:34:50.880 --> 02:34:57.440]  and it's that little act it's that energy so many people don't even want to talk to other people
[02:34:57.440 --> 02:35:00.400]  that's why i love living out in the country because people talk to you they smile at your
[02:35:00.400 --> 02:35:04.960]  children i understand being in the city being busy having some place to go but it's just this
[02:35:04.960 --> 02:35:12.320]  me me me me me me me attitude where you think you're getting ahead because you're so self-centered
[02:35:12.320 --> 02:35:16.320]  now i get because the people are so nasty in the city on the on the on the other side not
[02:35:16.320 --> 02:35:22.800]  want to strike up a conversation because they can get so weird and and and all of that compounds
[02:35:22.800 --> 02:35:30.640]  in together all of that becomes a major issue now martin reyno has always been very punctual
[02:35:30.640 --> 02:35:35.920]  on the show he's down in Rio de Janeiro covering the big u.n conference his skype didn't work
[02:35:35.920 --> 02:35:40.880]  yesterday which and now the phone isn't working and it may be a time zone issue that's why time
[02:35:40.880 --> 02:35:44.800]  zones are so weird you got to tell them okay you want to come on you'll be on in five hours
[02:35:45.840 --> 02:35:50.800]  in my experience with some somebody's in a totally different what we are getting him okay
[02:35:52.720 --> 02:35:58.880]  now he's on skype i just heard his voice okay i don't even i like mark always a jovial friendly
[02:35:58.880 --> 02:36:06.640]  person uh continuing here the supreme court was going to release the info this morning
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:09.840]  and then it was this afternoon and then it was in the next few days that's why i was like
[02:36:09.840 --> 02:36:13.920]  i'm not going to cover when this supreme court decision comes out because they could wait and
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:20.000]  now they're saying next week the hill newspaper reporting tensions rise as justices kick health
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.880]  care ruling the next week and i've predicted it's going to be scaled back health care
[02:36:24.880 --> 02:36:31.200]  care but the banks want it they wrote it but people aren't buying it and so it'll be selectively
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:37.280]  enforced it'll just codify where uh basically they make you get health care and then now charity
[02:36:37.280 --> 02:36:41.120]  care doesn't exist anymore unless you're an illegal alien it'll just be an even more of
[02:36:41.120 --> 02:36:46.720]  a scam and fraud when they're done and it'll be called a uh you know victory for conservatives
[02:36:46.720 --> 02:36:50.320]  to be mean and not give people health care really we had health care in the best of the
[02:36:50.320 --> 02:36:55.600]  world the cheapest in the world and everybody got taken care of until government got involved
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:58.080]  how many medical doctors have i had on this broadcast
[02:37:01.280 --> 02:37:05.680]  who talk about how when they went to college just 30 40 years ago they were told you will
[02:37:05.680 --> 02:37:11.280]  do one third of your care as charity care even if you're in a for-profit hospital this is what
[02:37:11.280 --> 02:37:18.000]  you do hypocritic of and they expanded on that these so-called uh charity hospitals and that's
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.080]  most of them that got taken over by the Rockefellers and other big foundations they're supposed to be
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:26.960]  charity hospitals but they're really big profit hospitals it's just that since they're tax-free
[02:37:26.960 --> 02:37:31.920]  they don't pay taxes great scam so nobody can compete with them so they've taken over and
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:36.560]  they're jacking up the prices a lot of other things get involved here but now that we have
[02:37:36.560 --> 02:37:40.960]  socialist health care now the government says we do have to cut back on the quality and now
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:45.760]  they're admitting in england over a hundred what was it 30 000 old people killed each year
[02:37:45.760 --> 02:37:49.360]  oh your your brain tumor is a hundred percent operable have done in one month
[02:37:49.360 --> 02:37:53.360]  you're going to wait 18 months well well it's almost a hundred percent kill within one year
[02:37:53.360 --> 02:37:59.280]  this is i've watched their parliament where they admit it were those defending the national
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:04.880]  health service admit it okay we got big breaking news here ladies and gentlemen
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:13.760]  mark morano joins us from the Rio de Janeiro earth summit and uh this is big news this is
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:20.400]  big news now we've got it linked up at info wars.com from where it originates climate depot.com
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:29.680]  farmer top congressional advisor researcher mark morano and also christopher montan of
[02:38:29.680 --> 02:38:35.120]  brinchley lord christopher montan they are making the new global government treaty
[02:38:35.680 --> 02:38:39.040]  which they admit you'll be arrested they said this in bourbon last year if you criticize
[02:38:39.040 --> 02:38:46.000]  uh their carbon taxes by the way guys pull up the headline one million million dollar fine
[02:38:46.560 --> 02:38:52.400]  or or million fine in australia for criticizing carbon tax you'll get mainstream news saying
[02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:57.600]  they have secret agents starts next week listening if you complain or say it's costing more money
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:03.040]  this is australia supposedly part of the you know western free speech this is worse than
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:09.840]  communist china well now un censorship rio earth summit text is now secret senior official of
[02:39:09.840 --> 02:39:16.240]  transparent un admits rio negotiating text is classified we got lord monster on tomorrow
[02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:22.560]  joining us is mark morano now mark big breaking news here tell us about it yeah this is a shock
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:27.200]  and i've been to every un conference pretty much since the the last earth summit in johannesburg
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:32.880]  south africa 2002 and you've always been able to go up and take a look at their draft text they have
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:38.400]  a un documentation center they've always been willing to provide it well as you know lord montan
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:44.240]  and a climate depot broke this story in durbin last year about the climate criminal court and the
[02:39:44.240 --> 02:39:48.640]  rights of mother earth and and you know you picked it up it ended up on the drudge report it got
[02:39:48.640 --> 02:39:54.160]  picked up all over the internet on television cable news this became a huge embarrassment for the un
[02:39:54.160 --> 02:40:00.160]  which they then pulled those parts of the agreement at the last minute well this year they seem to be
[02:40:00.160 --> 02:40:05.520]  have learned from their mistake and now they have everything behind restricted access we
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:11.120]  can't even have access to the government delegation we can't have access to the plenary session
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:16.960]  we can't have access to these texts either hard copy or available online they have completely
[02:40:16.960 --> 02:40:21.040]  shut down what they've what they've previously have said this is going to be the most transparent
[02:40:21.040 --> 02:40:26.000]  conference they're going to make everything available they are they apparently have a lot to
[02:40:26.000 --> 02:40:32.720]  hide and here we are now it's going to full day two of this conference and we have no idea what
[02:40:32.720 --> 02:40:37.520]  they're doing behind the scenes because for the first time ever they banned us and they banned the
[02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:42.240]  public they banned all the other organizations here from having a right to know unless you are
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:47.440]  part of an official government delegation so a desperate circling of the wagons and open
[02:40:47.440 --> 02:40:53.040]  authoritarianism now two and a half three years ago at Copenhagen they kept saying they would bring
[02:40:53.040 --> 02:40:58.640]  it out but we're negotiating behind the scenes you guys got a leaked copy that totally destroyed them
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:03.760]  where they said right at double the cuts for the third world they told the third world hey get
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:08.960]  america get europe we're going to give you money it was no such thing it was a eugenics blueprint
[02:41:08.960 --> 02:41:15.040]  so now they want our governments to sign on to this global governance treaty break this down but
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:20.240]  we're not allowed to see it and then i want you to segue into i'm sure you saw the articles
[02:41:20.240 --> 02:41:26.000]  where with a straight face they have the head quote climate cop saying you will be fine 1.1
[02:41:26.000 --> 02:41:32.640]  million australian or arrested if you talk bad about carbon taxes yes i mean that's all part and
[02:41:32.640 --> 02:41:37.040]  parcel we have morey strong had just made an appearance here yesterday and he of course was
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:42.880]  the godfather of the first uh earth summit and he's down here and it's not surprising this is all
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:48.320]  he's now by the way he's now claiming uh that he just went to china as a coincidence not to avoid
[02:41:48.320 --> 02:41:52.720]  jail or to avoid any uh criminal prosecution that always has happened to be a coincidence
[02:41:52.720 --> 02:41:57.360]  uh after the un scandals of years ago he's down there and it's not surprising that they've they've
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:04.480]  really turned what this this process on its head by could be being completely secret we don't exactly
[02:42:04.480 --> 02:42:08.880]  know what's going to come out of this secretary of state hillary clinton is going to be arriving
[02:42:08.880 --> 02:42:14.640]  shortly uh and also todd stern the u.s climate envoy i don't know what's going to survive in
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:19.760]  this draft yet maybe we'll find out on sunday or monday when this is all true we'll have to see
[02:42:19.760 --> 02:42:24.320]  but so now it's like a giant bill berg group meeting with thousands of people paid for
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:29.440]  a taxpayer money and we're not allowed to even know what's going on that's exactly what's happening
[02:42:29.440 --> 02:42:35.360]  yes and interestingly enough we also have richard branson made an appearance today lucy lawless it
[02:42:35.360 --> 02:42:41.200]  was arrested protesting arctic drilling the actress from zina princess warrior actor ed norton is
[02:42:41.200 --> 02:42:46.480]  down here uh richard branson was particularly offensive he was against oil drilling despite
[02:42:46.480 --> 02:42:52.640]  owning three airline companies a space company he's touting small island nations ability to
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:58.000]  live without carbon based energy and go carbon neutral while he himself jets around the world
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:04.880]  this is a guy who's got untold millions of dollars maybe even a billionaire proudly touting poor
[02:43:04.880 --> 02:43:10.720]  people living at barely subsistence level for for rejecting carbon based energy and we're supposed
[02:43:10.720 --> 02:43:17.440]  to be looking up to this man he did a whole thing with greenpeace today talking about banning oil
[02:43:17.440 --> 02:43:22.880]  drilling in the arctic in other places and this is the man who's made his fortune off of carbon
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.760]  based fuel through his airlines and he's talking about space exploration at the same time so this
[02:43:27.760 --> 02:43:34.640]  is the kind of offensive hypocrisy repulsive stuff going on here and keep in mind james camera was
[02:43:34.640 --> 02:43:39.920]  down in brazil a fleet with last year protesting development projects here that would bring running
[02:43:39.920 --> 02:43:45.440]  water and electricity oh i'm going to stop you in europe way in places the amish went into
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:50.880]  desert areas drilled wells they're running russia and in germany hundreds of years ago
[02:43:50.880 --> 02:43:55.360]  they built it up they're supplying half the food to multiple countries and i've seen articles where
[02:43:55.360 --> 02:44:01.840]  the un is trying to take their land saying they're not good environmental stewards all they want to
[02:44:01.840 --> 02:44:07.200]  land they're murdering criminal pigs yes we have reports of them slaughtering people in africa and
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:12.720]  other places to seize this land all parts of these carbon credits and new things and you mentioned
[02:44:12.720 --> 02:44:18.480]  australia australia is now in the process of setting up essentially a climate central bank
[02:44:18.480 --> 02:44:22.800]  and they're appointing people to set a price on carbon to set renewable energy mandates
[02:44:22.800 --> 02:44:27.440]  and most frightening of all if you're a business owner and your costs go up and you have to raise
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:35.040]  your prices you are forbidden by law to tell customers that it's the wacky and and carbon
[02:44:35.040 --> 02:44:40.720]  policies of your government that are driving up prices and this is from a country that under john
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:46.640]  howard just a few short years ago i think till 2007 had joined the united states in opposing the
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:53.920]  Kyoto protocol and all this un nonsense they went from being a free individual individualistic
[02:44:53.920 --> 02:44:59.840]  country to being bought and paid for by the greens in australia that is shocking if it can
[02:44:59.840 --> 02:45:05.360]  happen in australia and they can have this kind of suppression of free speech and economic activity
[02:45:05.360 --> 02:45:11.360]  by the way we're we're not joking i've read the quotes from the official site they call it lying
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:16.960]  no judge no jury they said we're going to have our spies in your stores on the streets if we hear
[02:45:16.960 --> 02:45:24.240]  any criticism of this tax when it goes in some areas 50 percent you will be given a 1.1 million
[02:45:24.240 --> 02:45:31.600]  fine or arrested i mean that's like out of this old soviet union i mean this is yeah they admit
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:37.600]  it's going to increase prices so they're saying you have no free speech i just can't believe
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:44.320]  how evil these people are yeah i mean this is and this this you think would wake up the
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:48.640]  conscious of liberals who seem to be you know always try to tout free speech but it shows you
[02:45:49.360 --> 02:45:53.840]  they don't really care about free speech when they just care about speech they don't agree with
[02:45:53.840 --> 02:45:58.400]  and they this is this is a shocking thing again australia is not the country that would have
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:05.360]  profiled to sit and take this idly by this was a country again that was actually on the outskirts
[02:46:05.360 --> 02:46:09.600]  with the united states and all these processes but because of you know their new government and
[02:46:09.600 --> 02:46:14.560]  julia galard actually said initially when she was running she would never support a carbon tax but
[02:46:14.560 --> 02:46:19.520]  then she had to get an alliance with the greens in australia and so she reversed herself so it's
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:24.560]  likely the next election in australia will throw them out but it's amazing to watch this happen
[02:46:24.560 --> 02:46:29.840]  australians should be rebelling in the street it's a total coup d'etat by a corporate crony
[02:46:29.840 --> 02:46:35.280]  government bureaucrat class were designed to face a foreign enemy with ships and planes and weapons
[02:46:35.280 --> 02:46:39.440]  you know an enemy running over the hill five thousand years ago with clubs were not designed
[02:46:39.440 --> 02:46:45.840]  for the creepy bureaucrats that just ooze around but now they've gotten so overt what is going on i
[02:46:45.840 --> 02:46:52.400]  mean is the world mounts against them are they just going into like some type of bizarre uh
[02:46:52.400 --> 02:46:59.840]  you know frothing power trip uh is is is this a fleeing forward by these kleptocratic control freaks
[02:47:00.880 --> 02:47:06.880]  you know it's hard to say they can't be overly happy in one sense because 20 years ago they
[02:47:06.880 --> 02:47:11.920]  pressured a republican president george h w bush to show up at the earth summit in rio
[02:47:11.920 --> 02:47:17.120]  now they can't even get barack obama to show up because environmentalism among the public
[02:47:17.120 --> 02:47:22.560]  is toxic john carrey said you can't even bring up global warming because people's eyes roll over he
[02:47:22.560 --> 02:47:27.760]  said it's extraordinary so world leaders are terrified of being associated with this but at
[02:47:27.760 --> 02:47:33.040]  the same time they want a stealth implementation they've bet the farm on it yes they want to do this
[02:47:33.040 --> 02:47:38.240]  behind the scenes and the un is cooperating by banning stuff making it secret classified
[02:47:38.240 --> 02:47:42.160]  but so what's happening is we don't know what's going on behind the scenes but publicly it's
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:47.840]  become toxic to associate with this so they're sending secretary of state hillary clinton here
[02:47:47.840 --> 02:47:51.440]  and it'll be interesting to see what hillary clinton has to say or do but i can't imagine
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:57.040]  she's going to say much publicly in addition they've gone after jesus christ here
[02:47:58.800 --> 02:48:04.080]  anywhere you walk in rio and on the beaches in the city you can see their famous and iconic
[02:48:04.080 --> 02:48:10.800]  jesus christ statue that overlooks the city it has now been turned green in honor of the earth
[02:48:10.800 --> 02:48:17.360]  summit by the united nations so you see this big green jesus hovering over the city it says james
[02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:22.320]  lovelock the father of the modern environmental movement who is now recanting almost fully
[02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:27.200]  has said the green religion is now taking over from the christian religion and that's nowhere
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:33.440]  more evident than to look at this abomination of this big green christ hovering over the city here
[02:48:34.480 --> 02:48:38.880]  wow i haven't seen that the news yet i've got to get that out at info wars dot com has that
[02:48:38.880 --> 02:48:43.760]  been posted at climate depot dot com yes i have a picture of a picture of the green jesus at climate
[02:48:43.760 --> 02:48:51.440]  depot and it's and it says this is just another morphing if you will of this this is you know
[02:48:51.440 --> 02:48:56.880]  what they say but wait a minute they're using big green light bulbs that burns carbon and the carbon
[02:48:56.880 --> 02:49:02.880]  dioxide the plants might breathe it and enjoy it this is a horrible environmental crime that's right
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:08.720]  and here's the thing at the last earth summit i interviewed jerry brown the governor of california
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:14.480]  and the same mindset here they will literally say that the developing world can't emulate
[02:49:14.480 --> 02:49:19.600]  the western wealthy nations they can't have our lifestyle because the earth can't handle it they
[02:49:19.600 --> 02:49:23.440]  need to learn from our mistakes oh yeah there's been back lashes tell us about that women are
[02:49:23.440 --> 02:49:29.120]  marching yes well that here's the thing that women marching is perversely enough they believe
[02:49:29.120 --> 02:49:34.880]  that capitalists have over to have taken over sustainable development they think it's a green
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:39.520]  sustained a capitalist sustainable development they want a socialist sustainable development
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:45.440]  so the un in the essence is being attacked from the left saying they're not socialist enough that's
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:48.800]  what those well yeah the left wants to shut everything down and live in mud hutch and ruin
[02:49:48.800 --> 02:49:53.280]  everybody's lives but they're mad that the bankers have figured out a way to scam everybody with it
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:58.720]  they're like no don't do that just kill us just kill us please well yeah going back to what i said
[02:49:58.720 --> 02:50:04.720]  jerry brown the idea that they the developing world isn't allowed to develop other than to have
[02:50:04.720 --> 02:50:10.000]  we have the un chairman here of the of the climate panel with jenna pichari touting solar lanterns
[02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  and they're touting essentially solar panels on huts made of dung in africa no exactly and it's
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:22.080]  white wealthy westerners telling people of color in the developing world how they should develop
[02:50:22.080 --> 02:50:27.040]  when i was in south africa which was in durban last december i met the south african activists who
[02:50:27.040 --> 02:50:32.560]  says openly the white wealthy western world has no business telling people of color how to develop
[02:50:32.560 --> 02:50:38.320]  in africa asia south america until we amazing mark stay there we're gonna come right back and i'll
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:42.320]  get lord mongton on tomorrow perhaps you can come on with him to make sure he can get on skype because
[02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:49.680]  it's been hard but it gets you on climate depot dot com i'm alex jones of info wars dot com we're
[02:50:49.680 --> 02:50:54.320]  going to come right back with the final segment with mark marino joining us from rio de Janeiro
[02:50:54.320 --> 02:50:59.120]  site of the un global government mass murder communist meeting we'll be right back

[02:54:34.160 --> 02:54:39.200]  dangerous these authoritarians are they're so out in the open they're so dangerous i mean it's
[02:54:39.200 --> 02:54:44.560]  like seeing hitler in old films i feel angry and threatened i see stalling i feel angry and threatened
[02:54:44.560 --> 02:54:51.840]  not because i'm some wimp i know dirtbags scum but they're dead these are real creeping vicious
[02:54:51.840 --> 02:54:57.120]  control freaks you're in a nest of them what is real like down there right now what are some of
[02:54:57.120 --> 02:55:01.760]  the other points well of course let me finish the point that south african activists have said
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:08.480]  the the wealthy western nations environmentalists have no business telling small countries
[02:55:08.480 --> 02:55:13.360]  undeveloped countries how to develop until washington paris and london are willing to
[02:55:13.360 --> 02:55:19.040]  to destroy themselves level themselves return to swamps wetlands and jungles until we're willing
[02:55:19.040 --> 02:55:24.160]  to do that we can't tell them how they can develop and we have hollywood celebrities buying carbon
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:29.840]  credits ten thousand dollars to go to african countries that will not allow africans to develop
[02:55:29.840 --> 02:55:35.120]  to keep their forest and you know to keep their force eugenics posing as liberal while they run
[02:55:35.120 --> 02:55:39.440]  tv ads while you're out of the country saying white sir racist have you heard of this new campaign
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:45.440]  um not that campaign no i haven't yeah well i'm in we'll talk about it tomorrow other points go
[02:55:45.440 --> 02:55:50.320]  ahead okay well the other thing is this city people think oh you're in a beautiful beach in rio i mean
[02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:55.760]  this is really i hate to use the word armpit but the beaches are filthy there's trash everywhere the
[02:55:55.760 --> 02:56:00.400]  infrastructures run down the sidewalks are crumbling the building sink and i'm in a very nice section
[02:56:00.400 --> 02:56:04.800]  i'm an epanema beach is where i'm staying in an air couple cabana there are a few nice places if
[02:56:04.800 --> 02:56:10.400]  you go but they're mostly private beaches but in terms of a public place this place this is it's
[02:56:10.400 --> 02:56:17.120]  major they always pick third world hellholes in a way we were in south africa they picked
[02:56:17.920 --> 02:56:22.960]  places in kenya previously they picked uh other they picked as far away as possible
[02:56:22.960 --> 02:56:27.920]  because the one thing the united nations knows how to do is throw a party and when they did the last
[02:56:27.920 --> 02:56:33.920]  u.n conference they actually the uk paper interviewed the chefs that were flown in to do caviar and
[02:56:33.920 --> 02:56:39.440]  champagne and all these all these exclusive meals while world leaders dined and toasted each other
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:46.000]  and talked about world poverty they also clean out all the local people from these cities to make
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:50.160]  them look as clean as possible so you end up hurting street vendors and other things here so
[02:56:50.800 --> 02:56:56.640]  it's all a facade everyone they purport to be helping they actually are hurting the most and
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:57:02.000]  places like india gets it developing world they told the u.n they will not sign on to any treaties
[02:57:02.000 --> 02:57:06.960]  that limit their China said no to look at this article since i mentioned it unfair campaign
[02:57:06.960 --> 02:57:13.200]  another divide and conquer front billboards tv ads saying i'm white that's unfair and saying whites
[02:57:13.200 --> 02:57:19.200]  are inherently bad this is being paid for by the state government of minnesota uh and with federal
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:23.600]  government funds as well what do you mean i mean again they're murdering people all over the world
[02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:29.280]  turning their power off or stopping development while lecturing us that white guys are bad total
[02:57:29.280 --> 02:57:34.320]  race war garbage what do you make of this yeah in fact we've unearthed some old papers this is
[02:57:34.320 --> 02:57:39.520]  an old impulse they said the climate was stable in australia this is back in the 1870s or so
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:45.600]  until white man settled white settlers came in uh and this is what this is this has been happening
[02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:49.680]  all along they're always trying to blame it on the evils of the white man in fact they would argue
[02:57:49.680 --> 02:57:55.360]  that you know western development is the most evil thing and that was and there's a race component
[02:57:55.360 --> 02:58:00.480]  to this when you have white wealthy westerners and i met people that come to these earth summits the
[02:58:00.480 --> 02:58:05.680]  college kids i call them eco missionaries they preach to the developing world living in huts of
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:11.280]  dung and and dire poverty that they're living earth friendly they're doing it right they've
[02:58:11.280 --> 02:58:18.320]  called the u.s lifestyle total bs because we have development we have wealth and we have infrastructure
[02:58:18.320 --> 02:58:23.680]  so they've turned everything's on its head at these conferences and these activists that are here
[02:58:23.680 --> 02:58:27.680]  well they're a foreign army they want to cut our resources off they work for the globalist
[02:58:27.680 --> 02:58:32.480]  it's a scientific plan thank you for going to great links to join us mark marrano you and
