[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:31.180]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.180 --> 00:37.860]  we've got Dr. Joseph Marcola joining us coming up in an hour to look at the fact
[00:37.860 --> 00:43.260]  that even the government mainstream media have been forced to admit that not
[00:43.260 --> 00:49.780]  just bisphenol a but many other plastic and petrochemical compounds in food
[00:49.780 --> 00:59.180]  packaging are causing cancer reduced fertility brain damage the list goes on
[00:59.180 --> 01:03.860]  and on I remember more than a decade ago seeing mainline governmental and
[01:03.860 --> 01:10.820]  university studies where they would have rats and mice and guinea pigs exposed
[01:10.820 --> 01:15.140]  to cell phone radiation while they were pregnant and it would cause all sorts of
[01:15.140 --> 01:20.340]  lowered mental acuity in the rodents and other problems and then they had other
[01:20.340 --> 01:24.780]  studies showing the same thing in humans that's back in the news back in
[01:24.780 --> 01:30.500]  the mainstream news today effect I've got an ABC news article on that front
[01:30.500 --> 01:36.100]  we're gonna be talking about with Dr. Marcola as well coming up in T minus one
[01:36.100 --> 01:41.060]  hour attorney Gary fielder who was in studio with us I don't know five six
[01:41.060 --> 01:45.620]  months ago he's the guy that filed suit over the naked body scanners in Denver
[01:45.620 --> 01:49.380]  now it's come out they are saving them but he also pointed out that it was
[01:49.380 --> 01:54.860]  violating child porn laws to scan under 18 and so they've stopped scanning under
[01:54.860 --> 02:01.380]  18 there but they try to grope you but he has filed a new injunction been served
[02:01.380 --> 02:06.860]  call a Colorado lawyer files for injunction against cousin Janet and
[02:06.860 --> 02:10.900]  the TSA he's going to be popping in coming up in about 30 minutes there's
[02:10.900 --> 02:15.580]  been some incredible new developments it turns out and Steve Watson has an
[02:15.580 --> 02:20.260]  article about this at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com that the TSA is
[02:20.260 --> 02:24.880]  concerned about radiation and there's been some internal studies done by homeland
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.700]  security but they're suppressing the findings of those studies well we already
[02:28.700 --> 02:34.740]  have prestigious radiologist on record across the spectrum pointing out how
[02:34.740 --> 02:40.420]  dangerous these scanners are even one or two exposures but that the people
[02:40.420 --> 02:46.300]  working around them are getting massive backscatter exposure and that it's very
[02:46.300 --> 02:50.620]  very dangerous and similar to a dental x-ray you notice the dental x-ray they
[02:50.620 --> 02:56.060]  they put lead shielding over your genitals and they run and hide behind a
[02:56.060 --> 03:00.540]  lead wall but there they just say we're the government we don't have to follow
[03:00.540 --> 03:07.180]  the regulation and laws we can just do whatever we want and that's now basically
[03:07.180 --> 03:11.100]  what they're doing so that's a huge development in fact we're very great
[03:11.100 --> 03:16.780]  very thankful for the gracious links that are almost continual at the drudge
[03:16.780 --> 03:22.500]  report on the whole TSA saga but I I would hope if drudge was listening I
[03:22.500 --> 03:27.380]  think this is very newsworthy now that they're suppressing a TSA revolt over
[03:27.380 --> 03:32.820]  radiation dangers with the scanners this could be the nail that literally puts
[03:32.820 --> 03:41.060]  the final final seal on the coffin of these naked body scanners which the
[03:41.060 --> 03:45.900]  feds are trying to roll out all over the streets of the United States also the
[03:45.900 --> 03:50.980]  video I shot a few days ago critical of big sis and the naked body scanners and
[03:50.980 --> 03:57.900]  big sis and the telescreens not just going in Walmart but Mall of America it's
[03:57.900 --> 04:02.860]  in the news the targets involved with Homeland Security and basically donates
[04:02.860 --> 04:07.540]  money to put up face scanning cameras nationwide I saw that in the news a few
[04:07.540 --> 04:14.860]  years ago it's back in the news today but it's just incredible that the New York
[04:14.860 --> 04:20.780]  Observer and others savaged yours truly and basically implied that I'm
[04:20.780 --> 04:25.540]  completely crazy because I don't like this but if you go to the official
[04:25.540 --> 04:30.220]  Homeland Security YouTube channel they will have per video thousands of
[04:30.220 --> 04:38.100]  dislikes for what Janet Apollo Thanos says is good next to maybe 20 30 likes so
[04:38.100 --> 04:44.860]  we're talking hundreds to one and then you go to my videos it'll be a thousand
[04:44.860 --> 04:50.420]  plus likes when I'm criticizing it versus eight dislikes so almost no one is
[04:50.420 --> 04:54.460]  buying the establishment's attempted takeover but they don't care they still
[04:54.460 --> 04:57.900]  sit up there and say all of you were crazy sticking our hands down your pants
[04:57.900 --> 05:03.340]  is good leaving the borders open as good hundreds of nations have fallen to
[05:03.340 --> 05:08.580]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history
[05:08.580 --> 05:12.820]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we pulling the rug from underneath the
[05:12.820 --> 05:17.500]  Americans at home I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[05:17.500 --> 05:22.620]  and they really are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[05:22.620 --> 05:27.740]  American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of
[05:27.740 --> 05:32.860]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and
[05:32.860 --> 05:36.780]  on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[05:36.780 --> 05:40.580]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[05:40.580 --> 05:44.460]  do we make the check out to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[08:12.180 --> 08:19.700]  he he's alex jones on the gcn radio network and now live from austin texas
[08:19.700 --> 08:23.340]  alex jones
[08:31.900 --> 08:38.940]  it is a Wednesday in the eighth day of December 2010 we're gonna be live here
[08:38.940 --> 08:47.220]  for the next three hours dr. joseph marcola very informative will be joining
[08:47.220 --> 08:51.940]  us coming up in the next hour coming up in about 25 minutes we're gonna be
[08:51.940 --> 08:57.540]  looking in depth at what is happening with the huge developments on the tsa
[08:57.540 --> 09:03.820]  front now a revolt by the tsa workers themselves over radiation concerns and I
[09:03.820 --> 09:09.660]  think this is again potentially the final nail in the coffin the globalists
[09:09.660 --> 09:13.780]  love to set incredible precedence if they can put up telescreens telling you
[09:13.780 --> 09:18.580]  to spy and title on your neighbors if they can put CIA commercials on
[09:18.580 --> 09:22.740]  television recruiting the general public to spy on each other they'll do it
[09:22.740 --> 09:26.620]  they'll they will turn us into the soviet union if they can stick their
[09:26.620 --> 09:30.100]  hands down our pants they'll do it if they can take the veterans pensions and
[09:30.100 --> 09:34.060]  healthcare they'll do it and are doing it if they can leave the borders wide
[09:34.060 --> 09:38.500]  open and let illegal aliens be above the law but throw the book at citizens for
[09:38.500 --> 09:43.660]  no reason they'll do it they are doing it they are attempting to set the
[09:43.660 --> 09:49.620]  precedent to get away with anything and everything they want but in their
[09:49.620 --> 09:54.220]  hubris and in their arrogant psychological warfare operation I know
[09:54.220 --> 09:59.380]  they have reached too far and there is a huge revolt against this system last
[09:59.380 --> 10:03.460]  night I had two hours the first two hours of coast to coast a.m. amazing
[10:03.460 --> 10:07.980]  callers and credible discussions we had about wiki leaks as as more and more
[10:07.980 --> 10:13.060]  really crystallizes on that front there's clearly skullduggery going on
[10:13.060 --> 10:19.140]  involved with wiki leaks with the cast Sunstein George Soros connections and it
[10:19.140 --> 10:25.500]  just shows how they've set up a sange as the fall guy as they always do and
[10:25.500 --> 10:29.060]  that's becoming crystal clear and we've got some new developments on that front
[10:29.060 --> 10:39.260]  that we are going to be discussing in detail coming up today we also have a
[10:39.260 --> 10:44.060]  lot of important news on military front North Korea fires artillery in its
[10:44.060 --> 10:49.340]  waters rattles financial markets and we're going to go into of course what's
[10:49.340 --> 10:54.420]  happening with the financial markets not just here in the United States but all
[10:54.420 --> 11:02.220]  over the world and I then have another important tidbit of news that I'm going
[11:02.220 --> 11:08.140]  to get into coming up briefly but it's important in the third hour today I
[11:08.140 --> 11:16.020]  talked to governor Ventura this morning at some length and he is still gauging
[11:16.020 --> 11:22.140]  exactly what he is going to do about the fact that government pressure was
[11:22.140 --> 11:29.700]  placed on time Warner and true TV to not re-air they normally are them
[11:29.700 --> 11:35.020]  literally more than 50 times the November 12th premiere of police state
[11:35.020 --> 11:38.740]  that got record ratings in this season for the broadcast before the
[11:38.740 --> 11:43.660]  transmission and you know they're not removing it and saying oh it's it's it's
[11:43.660 --> 11:47.220]  got wrong information they're not they're just saying nothing and I of
[11:47.220 --> 11:54.660]  course have the full story on what's going on but because someone involved in
[11:54.660 --> 12:02.700]  the attempt to scuttle the episode has now surfaced and now that it's public
[12:02.700 --> 12:09.020]  domain because again I'm in confidence with people with the show I'm involved I
[12:09.020 --> 12:12.940]  consult on it and if they say we don't want to talk about this at this time and
[12:12.940 --> 12:17.620]  then they give me this internal information I can't violate that confidence
[12:17.620 --> 12:24.140]  but I can read to you out of the newspaper and I saw eight different
[12:24.140 --> 12:27.780]  mainstream news articles dealing with this they're completely one-sided
[12:27.780 --> 12:36.940]  they're completely deceptive and so I will be talking about that coming up
[12:36.940 --> 12:45.540]  early in the third hour of the broadcast because this integrates in with the FCC
[12:45.540 --> 12:50.020]  commissioner and others openly saying that freedom on talk radio freedom on
[12:50.020 --> 12:53.500]  TV to have your own political views and to criticize government that that's an
[12:53.500 --> 12:57.900]  aberration and that it's going to be banned and they're taking over the
[12:57.900 --> 13:01.260]  internet they declare they've got power over that they're going to protect the
[13:01.260 --> 13:04.860]  airwaves and protect the internet by taking our rights the telescreens are
[13:04.860 --> 13:11.060]  going in the CIA ads are all over the different CSI shows where all of the
[13:11.060 --> 13:15.060]  couch potatoes sit there drinking their fluoride water and taking their brozac
[13:15.060 --> 13:20.940]  dreaming about how their spies and you know forensics officers and that goes
[13:20.940 --> 13:25.140]  back to Ventura when he first became governor he got called into the basement
[13:25.140 --> 13:29.180]  of the Capitol and there was 23 CIA agents in there they were little old
[13:29.180 --> 13:33.220]  black ladies and little old white ladies and little nerdly looking men they
[13:33.220 --> 13:39.180]  were his neighbors and they already have a huge criminal army and there's 15
[13:39.180 --> 13:44.140]  overall agencies hundreds of private contractors the government just spies on
[13:44.140 --> 13:48.660]  everything illegally they ship in the narcotics they work for Wall Street
[13:48.660 --> 13:55.260]  they're literally gutting the nation 600 plus trillion stolen of US money 1.5
[13:55.260 --> 13:59.380]  quadrillion worldwide and they're just they're just people on power trips you
[13:59.380 --> 14:02.860]  imagine they go into colleges they recruit people who think they're so
[14:02.860 --> 14:06.300]  cool being secret agents working for a criminal government they put out these
[14:06.300 --> 14:12.460]  images that they're all 007 James Bond and what do they do they go to our
[14:12.460 --> 14:16.580]  Patriot events and try to get us to fight with each other they spy on us they
[14:16.580 --> 14:21.380]  coordinate with the police departments on how to stage attacks in protest so the
[14:21.380 --> 14:26.620]  police can fire rubber bullets in the peaceful crowds they work on putting
[14:26.620 --> 14:31.060]  disinformation in local media and it's just a completely private criminal
[14:31.060 --> 14:36.660]  corporate army and and and now there's almost no oversight over the CIA or
[14:36.660 --> 14:41.140]  NSA now they're just moving on to private contractors doing whatever they
[14:41.140 --> 14:44.980]  want they drive around with 500 mobile vans looking through our walls
[14:44.980 --> 14:49.260]  radiating themselves they don't care the troops are being radiated and poisoned
[14:49.260 --> 14:56.300]  by the DU and again it's just a bunch of low IQ miscreants who get off on their
[14:56.300 --> 15:01.100]  CIA agents their their defense intelligence and I've seen these goons
[15:01.100 --> 15:06.140]  you know so many times when I was covering Bilderberg in Canada or in the
[15:06.140 --> 15:10.180]  United States there'd be some big shaved head guy thinks he's tough following
[15:10.180 --> 15:14.060]  you you just stop the car and get out and they just run off you know look your
[15:14.060 --> 15:18.740]  crooks you work for terrorist narcotics traffickers I'm done with you I'm not
[15:18.740 --> 15:22.940]  afraid of you and I don't care I don't care if you blow my head off tomorrow I
[15:22.940 --> 15:29.140]  enjoy life I love it but you know what I'm I'm deep down completely against
[15:29.140 --> 15:33.940]  being a coward and live it in the Soviet Union okay so I'm sick of the heroin and
[15:33.940 --> 15:37.660]  cocaine you ship in I'm sick of the congressional hearings about your
[15:37.660 --> 15:41.620]  dying core Halliburton fronts running giant kidnapping rings of small children
[15:41.620 --> 15:45.900]  and selling them to the Saudis and others I'm done you work for an evil out of
[15:45.900 --> 15:49.780]  control group I don't care how compartmentalized you are look if you're
[15:49.780 --> 15:53.700]  not a crook working for the FBI or CIA or all these other agencies then you're
[15:53.700 --> 15:58.460]  compartmentalized Dudley do write who they've got paper-pushing or who take
[15:58.460 --> 16:04.420]  some of the public service type PR front jobs and you're a joke to all the
[16:04.420 --> 16:10.980]  psychopathic sadistic criminals that you work with okay you are a joke to them
[16:10.980 --> 16:18.460]  understand that and I I'm just done I'm done with your Orwellian Cyop and they
[16:18.460 --> 16:23.660]  think they're smarter than us they get off on dumbing us down they get off on
[16:23.660 --> 16:27.940]  all the crimes they get to commit they are recruiting basically the equivalent
[16:27.940 --> 16:33.540]  of brown shirts to the CIA as auxiliary title tale assets that's what the threat
[16:33.540 --> 16:40.100]  fusion centers are they are literally going and hiring low IQ miscreants who
[16:40.100 --> 16:45.780]  get off on all of this and it's time to stand up to these crooks it's time to
[16:45.780 --> 16:51.300]  stand up to the Stasi and go look we know your bad news we know your villains
[16:51.300 --> 16:56.940]  and we're done playing games with you we are completely through playing games
[16:56.940 --> 17:02.060]  with you let me just run through some of the news headlines here today dealing
[17:02.060 --> 17:09.500]  with police state okay CBS News Walmart interested in wine vending machines now
[17:09.500 --> 17:13.940]  Steve Watson wrote about this about a year ago all over the country and in
[17:13.940 --> 17:20.060]  England they make you breathalyzer thumbprint swipe a license to buy wine
[17:20.060 --> 17:24.860]  or beer also a lot of new grocery stores are coming out in Europe and the
[17:24.860 --> 17:28.380]  United States where there is nothing but a security guard there and
[17:28.380 --> 17:36.020]  everything is a vending machine milk razors cookies lettuce everything is
[17:36.020 --> 17:39.620]  surveilled and there's a few security guards there you're being face-scan the
[17:39.620 --> 17:42.900]  whole time and that data is all being sold and you're it's being database what
[17:42.900 --> 17:46.900]  you purchase in your psychological profile that's all admitted now and this
[17:46.900 --> 17:51.420]  is the new system you will not be able to go into any store or facility and by
[17:51.420 --> 17:55.260]  anything without thumbprinting and swiping your license just like the no

[25:51.140 --> 25:56.260]  must live in government dormitory style houses this is the total re-engineering
[25:56.260 --> 26:00.100]  of society have you figured that out yet they admit that's what environmentalism
[26:00.100 --> 26:05.500]  is now it's a anti-human crusade by the elites to train us to be feudal
[26:05.500 --> 26:12.340]  prisoners granny's $100 ticket for throwing out newspaper New York Post an
[26:12.340 --> 26:15.780]  elderly Manhattan woman living on social security was slapped with a hundred
[26:15.780 --> 26:20.820]  dollar ticket just for throwing away a newspaper in the city's trash can but
[26:20.820 --> 26:23.860]  you notice the police don't stop all the hookers on the street corners
[26:23.860 --> 26:27.420]  everywhere in New York that are ubiquitous oh because they're getting a
[26:27.420 --> 26:31.860]  good fat cut of that they don't stop Dincor flying in the child sex slaves
[26:31.860 --> 26:38.460]  which are on record no no no no no they give the cattle tickets and it says that
[26:38.460 --> 26:43.140]  Delia Gluckin 80 tossed the paper into a bin right outside her in what
[26:43.140 --> 26:46.460]  apartment building Sunday morning only to be ambushed by an overzealous
[26:46.460 --> 26:52.740]  department of sanitation agent wielding a citation book I was walking to take the
[26:52.740 --> 26:57.020]  subway down and dropped it in the trash can and the lady in blue uniform ran up
[26:57.020 --> 27:01.380]  to me yeah there's all those famous videos that activists shoot on YouTube in
[27:01.380 --> 27:05.020]  New York where the police and firemen and others all park illegally in their own
[27:05.020 --> 27:08.860]  private cars and no one will give them a ticket it's kind of like in California
[27:08.860 --> 27:13.020]  there's over a million government names that are blacked out of the list and the
[27:13.020 --> 27:17.180]  license plate reading cameras are not allowed to scan them they're deleted
[27:17.180 --> 27:22.580]  automatically and so they get to speed and not pay tolls but see just like
[27:22.580 --> 27:29.580]  government gets to go around the TSA scanners this is the new America I thought
[27:29.580 --> 27:33.060]  she was gonna ask for directions he said you just dropped the garbage in there
[27:33.060 --> 27:37.620]  she went on to talk about how she yelled at her now here's another one
[27:37.620 --> 27:42.500]  fingerprint scanner use raises privacy concerns in North Carolina and it goes
[27:42.500 --> 27:46.340]  into 13 law enforcement agencies under a federal grant are getting thumb
[27:46.340 --> 27:50.260]  scanners and now anybody pulled over is going to be scanned but an illegal
[27:50.260 --> 27:53.740]  alien won't be in the database and they're allowed to drunk drive and if
[27:53.740 --> 27:57.220]  they commit murders they're pretty much released in after just a few months in
[27:57.220 --> 28:00.340]  many cases I mean a Houston Chronicle reported a quarter of million illegal
[28:00.340 --> 28:05.260]  aliens released just a few years ago in one year in Texas many of violent
[28:05.260 --> 28:13.420]  aggravated felons rape arson manslaughter but you the cattle you got
[28:13.420 --> 28:16.900]  to get used to giving those thumb prints at the gym or the tanning salon or at
[28:16.900 --> 28:21.180]  the library or to get your school lunch because it's been stated by the big
[28:21.180 --> 28:24.940]  biometric consortiums on record you're going to do this worldwide they're
[28:24.940 --> 28:28.620]  going to debase all the global currencies create the sdr that now the
[28:28.620 --> 28:32.700]  U.S. Postal Service and UPS list their international shipments in this is on
[28:32.700 --> 28:36.460]  record the Texas Workforce Commission two years ago sent me the letter saying
[28:36.460 --> 28:39.900]  I'm now under the North American Union I report to the North American Union
[28:39.900 --> 28:44.460]  office not to the feds anymore on my employees and unemployment insurance
[28:44.460 --> 28:48.780]  that was also in world net daily of course he got a copy of it from another
[28:48.780 --> 28:53.940]  business I think was in California but the point is we're already here and then
[28:53.940 --> 28:57.740]  it's just well you can still have cash creds but those are issued basically by
[28:57.740 --> 29:01.620]  banks there will be hundreds of currencies that are paper but based on
[29:01.620 --> 29:06.180]  sdrs but we got a global sales tax and a regional sales tax you got a thumb
[29:06.180 --> 29:13.380]  print and face scan to activate it and the feds are running in Mexico and the
[29:13.380 --> 29:16.740]  U.S. and Canada test cities where they're trying to make everyone do this
[29:16.740 --> 29:21.500]  this is their control grid okay I mean they're not playing games so there's a
[29:21.500 --> 29:25.860]  McClatchy news article on that here's another one UPS requires photo ID for
[29:25.860 --> 29:31.340]  shipping because you know the terrorist might be trying to mail something even
[29:31.340 --> 29:34.100]  though they have bomb sniffing dogs and x-ray machines and even though we know
[29:34.100 --> 29:38.660]  who's mailing those bombs 99% of the time it's the same folks protecting us oh
[29:38.660 --> 29:43.300]  but don't worry there's new IRS rules coming in this January now they're just

[34:20.860 --> 34:30.380]  Alalaki the admitted head operative of L CIA to Al Qaeda and he basically said
[34:30.380 --> 34:34.700]  okay mail it to this address and then hung up on us because anybody with half
[34:34.700 --> 34:39.580]  a brand the FBI knows the FBI was ordered to stand down on 9-11 that's on
[34:39.580 --> 34:44.700]  record but again our government will shoot up children with syphilis and
[34:44.700 --> 34:50.100]  polio and nerve gas our own troops but they would and that's all on record
[34:50.100 --> 34:55.340]  and radiate foster children to death but but they would never stage a 9-11
[34:55.340 --> 35:02.500]  attack sure in one study they radiated 4,000 plus children to death little
[35:02.500 --> 35:07.380]  foster children they took but that's okay that's what you do to fight for
[35:07.380 --> 35:11.620]  America so I thought for anybody that wants to be recruited by this I'd air
[35:11.620 --> 35:18.220]  one of the CIA ads that they're airing all over television again where you can
[35:18.220 --> 35:24.060]  help America yeah set up by Wall Street in 1947 and skull and bones out of Yale
[35:24.060 --> 35:31.820]  you can help kill America you can help give fertilizer to the Taliban to grow
[35:31.820 --> 35:38.620]  opium you can and again this is in congressional hearings but I mean I've
[35:38.620 --> 35:42.540]  had family who was recruited by the CIA who got out of it because they were
[35:42.540 --> 35:49.020]  told of traffic narcotics in the US okay they count on you being sheep like
[35:49.020 --> 35:53.580]  ladies and gentlemen stop being sheep like and if you're a sheep like CIA
[35:53.580 --> 35:58.660]  person or FBI get mad right now you're a little kid you're a baby okay if you're
[35:58.660 --> 36:04.820]  sitting there going this isn't true don't say that you are an idiot okay
[36:04.820 --> 36:09.780]  everything I've said here is on record let's go ahead and play that ad here it
[36:09.780 --> 36:15.420]  is
[36:15.420 --> 36:21.460]  some heroes are inspired by the mission not the recognition what about you
[36:21.460 --> 36:26.740]  consider a career with central intelligence agency be America's first
[36:26.740 --> 36:31.620]  line of defense be your innovative best
[36:31.620 --> 36:38.940]  why work for a company when you can serve your nation the CIA the work of a
[36:38.940 --> 36:48.580]  nation the center of intelligence yeah the work of the nation being part of a
[36:48.580 --> 36:53.020]  quasi government private army running around overthrowing governments
[36:53.020 --> 36:58.700]  overthrowing our government in 1963 blowing Kennedy's head off and we're
[36:58.700 --> 37:02.500]  all supposed to be in awe of secret agents because of all the TV shows and
[37:02.500 --> 37:09.420]  and movies I'm not in awe of any of it but your crimes and let it be remembered
[37:09.420 --> 37:13.140]  I'm a Liberty lover I'm someone who wants freedom I'm someone who can
[37:13.140 --> 37:18.340]  recognize corruption I was watching some of their ads and it's like do you like
[37:18.340 --> 37:26.860]  ambiguity I mean that's telling you right there do you like you'll being a
[37:26.860 --> 37:33.580]  crook well join the CIA all right I'm done ranting about this we've got some
[37:33.580 --> 37:39.820]  big developments on the TSA front I'm gonna get to here in a few minutes with
[37:39.820 --> 37:45.580]  our guest but but but just recapping what I was getting into Walmart interested
[37:45.580 --> 37:50.140]  in wine vending machines we got a breathalyzer and in biometrically scan
[37:50.140 --> 37:53.460]  and scan your driver's license this is going in all over the world getting you
[37:53.460 --> 37:59.060]  ready for the cashless society and the national sales tax granny ticketed $100
[37:59.060 --> 38:05.700]  for throwing out newspaper in New York the Green Police fingerprint scanner use
[38:05.700 --> 38:10.500]  raises privacy concerns they're gonna thumb scan anybody pulled over in
[38:10.500 --> 38:18.220]  America UPS requires photo ID for shipping seeing an end now here's the
[38:18.220 --> 38:26.220]  last one new rules you and the IRS this January the new Obamacare 1099 rule for
[38:26.220 --> 38:32.260]  reporting of all cash credit and check business transactions of $600 or more is
[38:32.260 --> 38:37.700]  scheduled to begin in January this is really an extension of the 2008 Housing
[38:37.700 --> 38:42.820]  and Recovery Act IRS rules that start this January when merchant banks and pay
[38:42.820 --> 38:48.020]  pal will report business sales directly to the IRS the reporting threshold is
[38:48.020 --> 38:56.060]  $20,000 or 200 transactions a year so the smallest businesses online are
[38:56.060 --> 39:00.100]  getting 200 transactions a year most little eBay accounts have 200
[39:00.100 --> 39:06.540]  transactions a year so what did they just calmly report there this is being
[39:06.540 --> 39:11.380]  reported by the AP Reuters like it's a great thing they just reported there
[39:11.380 --> 39:15.820]  with a straight face that everything you're doing in your business is being
[39:15.820 --> 39:20.540]  sent directly to the government no judge no jury no warrant but what a wired
[39:20.540 --> 39:25.100]  magazine report last week all your credit cards all your customer loyalty
[39:25.100 --> 39:29.500]  cards those companies are all being paid to run that directly through the
[39:29.500 --> 39:38.580]  government this is more intrusive than the fictitious 1984 or the real East
[39:38.580 --> 39:46.180]  German Stasi in the 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s up until 89 this is the opposite of
[39:46.180 --> 39:51.860]  freedom and they're just now announcing to you what's already happening okay so
[39:51.860 --> 39:57.620]  it's secret what the Federal Reserve is doing but what you're doing is out on the
[39:57.620 --> 40:03.980]  open and they can use this to track you to control you to you know Google when
[40:03.980 --> 40:07.660]  you go put something in Google oh I'm getting answers well they're getting
[40:07.660 --> 40:13.380]  answers about you building that dossier they are an admitted CIA NSA creation so
[40:13.380 --> 40:20.180]  is Walmart folks from the beginning Sam Walton you go to the research CIA setup
[40:20.180 --> 40:25.620]  they use their couriers and trucks for you can imagine what it's a mafia so of
[40:25.620 --> 40:29.820]  course they're involved in the adoption of RFID and the in the universal
[40:29.820 --> 40:33.540]  product code of course they're the first to put in telescreens it's not just
[40:33.540 --> 40:37.300]  going to be Janet giving you orders it's going to be endless streams of look for
[40:37.300 --> 40:40.880]  this person look for that person they're coming out with license plates that have
[40:40.880 --> 40:44.100]  government messages on them saying the license plate is the government's
[40:44.100 --> 40:51.460]  property on your car this is all happening and it's run by a government on
[40:51.460 --> 40:59.180]  record in congressional hearings in 2004 2005 that allows Dinecore and
[40:59.180 --> 41:04.980]  Halliburton to run giant industrial sex slave rackets white slavery with women
[41:04.980 --> 41:10.260]  children and no one gets in trouble I mean these are the worst people and they
[41:10.260 --> 41:15.660]  look at anybody who isn't pure evil as a schmuck as a as adult as an idiot as
[41:15.660 --> 41:21.300]  this is the way it is and they've got endless armies of control freaks who
[41:21.300 --> 41:25.500]  love it that's why they try to corrupt society so that good people wouldn't
[41:25.500 --> 41:29.540]  stand up against them so when you sign on to this criminal government you sign
[41:29.540 --> 41:33.700]  on to children being raped and then having their heads blown off with 357
[41:33.700 --> 41:38.860]  magnums and snuff films that's what goes on okay that's who runs this country
[41:38.860 --> 41:42.140]  people that like to blow children's heads off people that like to rape
[41:42.140 --> 41:46.740]  children in front of their parents that's in the army's own report on Abu
[41:46.740 --> 41:51.260]  Ghaib and Bush says he'd do it all over again he'd give the orders again John
[41:51.260 --> 41:55.740]  Hughes orders Alberta Gonzalez memo about crushing children's testicles with
[41:55.740 --> 42:01.100]  pliers that is land of the free home of the brave and Americans watch Jack
[42:01.100 --> 42:05.740]  Bauer doing similar things and fantasize about it and become synthetic
[42:05.740 --> 42:11.420]  psychopaths we are on a journey into absolute hell and they're trying to test
[42:11.420 --> 42:16.780]  us now to see if we go along with it all right I'm done ranting our guest is on
[42:16.780 --> 42:21.140]  hold big developments on the TSA front and if you're doubting me the army's
[42:21.140 --> 42:24.500]  own reports I've had the former head of the Army DU program on Dr. Doug Rocky
[42:24.500 --> 42:31.620]  physicist and doctor their own reports that are public said you breathe in a
[42:31.620 --> 42:35.300]  few microns of this you're going to get lung cancer you're going to get liver
[42:35.300 --> 42:39.260]  cancer you're gonna get urethra cancer you're going to get kidney cancer it's
[42:39.260 --> 42:44.860]  going to kill you may take 10 years they started using it 20 years ago now they
[42:44.860 --> 42:48.300]  use it everywhere they just don't care just like they don't care these
[42:48.300 --> 42:51.500]  radiation scanners are gonna end up killing the people that are using them
[42:51.500 --> 42:56.260]  just like they got 500 mobile vans super high power that dwarf chest x-rays
[42:56.260 --> 42:59.980]  looking through your walls no shielding for the operators they don't care they
[42:59.980 --> 43:04.420]  know the operators are in a self-induced mind control television culture
[43:04.420 --> 43:08.340]  trance think about it people are actually in a trance and they will get in
[43:08.340 --> 43:13.100]  those vehicles and kill themselves you know almost all of them within just a
[43:13.100 --> 43:16.060]  few years will come down with cancer we've had medical doctors on and
[43:16.060 --> 43:20.660]  radiologists they don't care if they can run child kidnapping rings and have the
[43:20.660 --> 43:23.820]  troops breathe do you and announce they're gonna take the troops health
[43:23.820 --> 43:30.660]  care away we're in a soft kill concentration camp okay but they're not
[43:30.660 --> 43:33.540]  ready to move yet they're starting to announce they want to censor the web
[43:33.540 --> 43:36.980]  they're starting to announce they want to censor the internet they're starting
[43:36.980 --> 43:41.700]  to be more bold because they're getting ready and they're gonna stage false flag
[43:41.700 --> 43:44.380]  attacks I talked to Ventura he said he could feel it he can see it getting
[43:44.380 --> 43:49.100]  ready I agree with him this morning they're gonna go for broke and and you'll
[43:49.100 --> 43:52.580]  see all the American flags go out and all the worship of the homeland security
[43:52.580 --> 43:56.660]  neighborhood spies when they nuke a city or when they release a bio weapon and
[43:56.660 --> 44:00.020]  I'm telling you they're the ones that are behind it just like they're behind
[44:00.020 --> 44:05.300]  everything else and all you TSA people and all you FBI people and you CIA folks
[44:05.300 --> 44:08.820]  that are compartmentalized and and think you're the good guy so you were put a
[44:08.820 --> 44:12.420]  different compartment on the right side you better grow up right now and
[44:12.420 --> 44:15.620]  realize and you look you intellectually know I'm telling you the truth in your
[44:15.620 --> 44:21.260]  gut you've got a survival instinct God gave you you know this is real from the
[44:21.260 --> 44:26.380]  heart you know I'm risking my life to do this it's not a risk I care about this
[44:26.380 --> 44:31.260]  species even more than I care about my wife and children because they don't
[44:31.260 --> 44:35.500]  have a future if I don't stand up and we're all in danger and that's the way
[44:35.500 --> 44:40.300]  it is and I'm all in I'm like God I'm going in all the way I'm hardcore
[44:40.300 --> 44:46.580]  energize me I'm ready that's the end of it terrorist child rapers we're coming
[44:46.580 --> 44:52.140]  for you you understand that you may use your 501c3 brainwashed churches to tell
[44:52.140 --> 44:55.220]  Christians it's the end of the world so they stand down and go along with this
[44:55.220 --> 44:59.860]  but we're gonna rebuke you all right I'm done ranting I and I'm sorry to have
[44:59.860 --> 45:02.460]  our guests holding the holding five minutes of the next hour that of Dr.
[45:02.460 --> 45:07.580]  Markola but I wanted to get an update from Gary fielder law.com Gary fielder
[45:07.580 --> 45:11.380]  criminal and constitutional lawyer from Denver he sued and got him to stop
[45:11.380 --> 45:15.260]  body-scanning under 18s at the courthouse he's done a lot more on that
[45:15.260 --> 45:21.620]  front and now he has filed for injunction against cousin Janet and the TSA and I
[45:21.620 --> 45:25.500]  wanted to get an update from him on what he's doing Gary good to have you on
[45:25.500 --> 45:31.020]  with us thank you so much for having me on your show what do you think of the
[45:31.020 --> 45:36.220]  stuff I just covered in the last five minutes well that was an eye-opening
[45:36.220 --> 45:39.860]  experience every time I listen to your show I learn more and more and more and
[45:39.860 --> 45:46.180]  there's not a part of it that I can say you're exaggerating one millimeter it's
[45:46.180 --> 45:52.100]  coming down the line all of us see it from grandma to the little kids they
[45:52.100 --> 45:56.380]  all see it and all you got to do is point it out like for example when you
[45:56.380 --> 46:00.140]  talk about TV anybody that watches TV ought to know that they're being
[46:00.140 --> 46:04.300]  brainwashed at a very sophisticated level and so when you're walking around
[46:04.300 --> 46:09.100]  Walmart you might even consciously disagree with what you're hearing or
[46:09.100 --> 46:13.220]  what you're seeing but they're bombarding our subconscious yes and
[46:13.220 --> 46:17.940]  they're implanting it in a very sophisticated way to keep our subconscious
[46:17.940 --> 46:22.700]  in fear so that our conscious mind ultimately ultimately reacts to that
[46:22.700 --> 46:26.940]  and in fear of each other you've got this authority figure on a big TV
[46:26.940 --> 46:31.580]  telling you to watch everyone when we should be watching her she works for the
[46:31.580 --> 46:38.660]  terrorist well I am not enjoying this experience of putting my name on a
[46:38.660 --> 46:44.020]  pleading next to hers that's for sure and I have nothing personal to say
[46:44.020 --> 46:49.260]  about her but when you're just a little bitty person and you take on the
[46:49.260 --> 46:53.500]  largest country in the world it does make me feel a little apprehensive and I
[46:53.500 --> 46:58.060]  know that there's a gentleman in the Little Rock Arkansas a child I think a
[46:58.060 --> 47:02.860]  somewhat similar action but in this circumstance being a lawyer being at
[47:02.860 --> 47:08.060]  least educated on this particular issue I felt it was my duty to file something
[47:08.060 --> 47:13.100]  to get this not only in the public eye but to get it in the courts so that we
[47:13.100 --> 47:17.620]  hear from them I want to know what the judge has to say and it's going to be a
[47:17.620 --> 47:22.420]  very sophisticated approach it's going to come down to expert witnesses it's
[47:22.420 --> 47:27.980]  going to come down to how well I you know move myself through the procedure
[47:27.980 --> 47:35.020]  which is always a matrix that a small person as a lawyer that is a solo
[47:35.020 --> 47:39.020]  practitioner of a small family office you know I'm going to be going up
[47:39.020 --> 47:43.420]  against the United States Attorney General's office and I doubt they'll
[47:43.420 --> 47:48.100]  concede my you have a lot of courage but I would surmise and correct me if I'm
[47:48.100 --> 47:52.700]  wrong at your gut level because you love humanity and you're a decent person
[47:52.700 --> 48:01.220]  you must sue Napolitano you must put yourself in their sights because if we
[48:01.220 --> 48:05.060]  give in they're going to roll over us anyway so you all we can do is stand up
[48:05.060 --> 48:10.540]  against them and I'm telling you Alex this is not just some esoteric issue
[48:10.540 --> 48:15.060]  that I'm bringing before the court I had heard that they were moving in the
[48:15.060 --> 48:20.780]  direction of these body scanners throughout the country they have two of
[48:20.780 --> 48:24.860]  them here in Denver but they still have sort of a standalone metal detector
[48:24.860 --> 48:29.460]  that you can choose to get in that line and when I went to San Diego for my
[48:29.460 --> 48:33.460]  20th year law school reunion I took my children along because it was just going
[48:33.460 --> 48:37.460]  to be a long weekend we had plans and we did go to SeaWorld and we really
[48:37.460 --> 48:43.820]  enjoyed some beautiful weather but I was not aware that in California they had
[48:43.820 --> 48:50.260]  changed the policy so that you had to choose between the body scanner and the
[48:50.260 --> 48:54.580]  full path down I had always sort of convinced myself that at every level I
[48:54.580 --> 48:58.220]  could talk my way out of it you know what I mean well that's like a logical
[48:58.220 --> 49:01.860]  warfare they always give a little outs but then close them down slower and
[49:01.860 --> 49:05.380]  slower because they know if they give an animal that's it this is animal
[49:05.380 --> 49:10.380]  psychology an escape route or a believed escape route they won't turn and fight
[49:10.380 --> 49:14.980]  and then they want to get you finally cornered and then chew your guts up and
[49:14.980 --> 49:20.620]  if you have gone through it personally then it's more than just an intellectual
[49:20.620 --> 49:26.340]  issue it is a degradation of your human right look I had Ron Paul on they
[49:26.340 --> 49:30.300]  actually grab his genitals I mean I mean this is this is the new America I
[49:30.300 --> 49:37.580]  walked up there and I had not seen the sort of bat scatter x-ray machine I
[49:37.580 --> 49:41.900]  had seen the twirly ones that you get into and those look a little ominous but
[49:41.900 --> 49:46.300]  these these backscatter ones they just look like two big black carpeted boxes
[49:46.300 --> 49:51.580]  and everyone was lined up and no one was opting out so when I got up to the
[49:51.580 --> 49:56.940]  actual secured area and of course we're experienced travelers even my small
[49:56.940 --> 50:02.420]  child we know to put the sandals on wear very light clothing we load our
[50:02.420 --> 50:06.340]  things in the bucket very quickly we're very experienced travelers so when I
[50:06.340 --> 50:09.420]  walked up there I asked the gentleman I said hey what is that and he said
[50:09.420 --> 50:13.340]  something that included the word scanner and I said well we're not going into
[50:13.340 --> 50:20.280]  that thing at all so immediately you get led around into a secured area and you
[50:20.280 --> 50:24.260]  know they got a little spot for your feet to go and you're disconnected from
[50:24.260 --> 50:28.620]  your property you're in their jurisdiction you're on their land and
[50:28.620 --> 50:34.580]  you have two choices at that point either stay where you're at which for us

[54:03.820 --> 54:09.340]  well a month ago in DC it even came out mainstream news the FBI went out and
[54:09.340 --> 54:13.460]  found mentally ill people tried to create a plot with inert explosives to blow
[54:13.460 --> 54:17.460]  up subways then we heard about it the plan to blow up the Christmas tree
[54:17.460 --> 54:23.020]  lighting in Oregon turned out that was a teenager completely set up they go out
[54:23.020 --> 54:28.860]  and find lunatics you or I could do this here's another story man arrested at
[54:28.860 --> 54:35.260]  recruitment center bomb plot in Baltimore Maryland he was arrested Tuesday
[54:35.260 --> 54:38.620]  for plotting to blow up a military recruitment center authority said the
[54:38.620 --> 54:42.540]  man was caught in a sting operation and was plotting to blow up an armed forces
[54:42.540 --> 54:48.980]  recruiting station in Cantonsville where he believed to be a bomb a vehicle bomb
[54:48.980 --> 54:52.460]  the US attorney said but they went on to say there was no actual danger to the
[54:52.460 --> 54:56.860]  public as the explosives were inert and the suspect had been carefully monitored
[54:56.860 --> 55:01.140]  by law enforcement for months so they go out and find real nuts then they make
[55:01.140 --> 55:04.900]  bombs for them but in the case of 93 World Trade Center the FBI actually made
[55:04.900 --> 55:08.900]  a real bomb ordered the informants to let it take place so I guess we should
[55:08.900 --> 55:13.420]  thank Obama at least they're just doing staged events that aren't real kind of
[55:13.420 --> 55:16.620]  like the Gulf of Tonkin saying the ship was attacked and it wasn't but then that
[55:16.620 --> 55:21.940]  led to the war that killed millions on the Vietnamese side 58,000 on the US side
[55:21.940 --> 55:27.940]  but talking to counselor lawyer Gary fielder who's been fighting the naked
[55:27.940 --> 55:31.940]  body scanners so you briefly you went through this with your family describe
[55:31.940 --> 55:39.700]  what happened so when they let us around the boxes which with the back scatter x-ray device you're
[55:39.700 --> 55:43.700]  in an area and you can see their instruments you know what's going to
[55:43.700 --> 55:47.500]  happen next so I turned around and I saw a blue glove on my nine-year-old
[55:47.500 --> 55:50.700]  daughter's shoulder and I said hey what are you doing get your hands off my
[55:50.700 --> 55:54.340]  child what is happening here I know they're training you to take your
[55:54.340 --> 55:58.740]  children away from you they're training you to go into prison camps so you know
[55:58.740 --> 56:02.940]  what I did I just started talking in a very monotone low volume and I didn't
[56:02.940 --> 56:06.620]  stop talking until I put my shoes on five minutes later and throughout the
[56:06.620 --> 56:10.500]  process I was just objecting this is outrageous I can't believe you're
[56:10.500 --> 56:13.740]  subjecting us to this we're being treated like criminals we've done nothing
[56:13.740 --> 56:17.900]  wrong all of you have a subconscious need to do this otherwise you wouldn't be
[56:17.900 --> 56:23.300]  doing it and it went on and on I want you to envision Alex your children know
[56:23.300 --> 56:29.500]  how you feel my children know how I feel for them to stand there and watch
[56:29.500 --> 56:36.100]  their father actually have to submit or just stay in San Diego was one of the
[56:36.100 --> 56:40.340]  most devastating things I've ever they teach you that the government is God
[56:40.340 --> 56:45.060]  and now all these top psychologists are on record saying these pat downs of
[56:45.060 --> 56:49.900]  children are teaching them to be molested and now when we have TV on or
[56:49.900 --> 56:53.820]  I'm researching and my children hear about the pat downs of children we have
[56:53.820 --> 56:58.660]  to explain to them that's wrong these are bad government people and don't let
[56:58.660 --> 57:04.420]  anybody else touch you like this I mean this it's total psychological warfare
[57:04.420 --> 57:10.100]  Gary so so the total psych off where are the paternal orders of police who
[57:10.100 --> 57:14.740]  often say they're proud to wear the uniform where are the firefighters who
[57:14.740 --> 57:20.420]  have to earn that uniform these people are put into uniform and so your
[57:20.420 --> 57:23.540]  children think that they're law enforcement officers they're not law
[57:23.540 --> 57:28.380]  enforcement officers by statute they're not trained in the Constitution and so
[57:28.380 --> 57:33.660]  our children are standing there one is their father objecting the other is
[57:33.660 --> 57:37.980]  their government that they've been taught to be obedient to they're put into a
[57:37.980 --> 57:42.980]  heavy conflict situation well it's more than that that's a great point Gary this
[57:42.980 --> 57:49.060]  is a new division of kind of minimum wage quasi police expanding on the
[57:49.060 --> 57:53.340]  streets of America literally true and now they're giving grants to police to
[57:53.340 --> 57:56.780]  take blood without warrants I mean this country is going down and they know
[57:56.780 --> 58:00.260]  exactly what they're doing well I want to know where the American Cancer
[58:00.260 --> 58:04.980]  Society is a lot of people have given them a lot of money instead of the NFL
[58:04.980 --> 58:10.100]  putting out these silly little ads sort of forcing us to go along with it I
[58:10.100 --> 58:15.220]  want to see the NAACP step up black people's rights are being violated just
[58:15.220 --> 58:19.620]  like white people's right where's mothers against drunk driving don't you see
[58:19.620 --> 58:24.860]  that the government is trying well I mean the NAACP is there to make sure 51
[58:24.860 --> 58:29.260]  percent of blacks are aborted there you set up by the eugenicist you want to
[58:29.260 --> 58:33.140]  kill the blacks you got opposes their friend and that came out with Margaret
[58:33.140 --> 58:37.100]  Sanger they set all that up stay there we're coming back in one minute we'll

[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:45.340]  right back to the cia sands himself clearly is the bag man they're flushing
[01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:50.660]  down the commode here but we're almost out of time gary fielder the lawyer
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:56.780]  who's been fighting successfully against the body scanners recapping i'd be
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:59.660]  this should be duplicated in other parts of the country especially now that we
[01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:04.340]  learned the federal courthouse in miami saved 30 plus thousand of these images
[01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:08.220]  and then even released some of them are now out there in the public the feds
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:13.220]  have been caught saving the images of the airport in line recap briefly your
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:19.060]  success in denver and so others can duplicated a and b what your lawsuit
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:25.580]  specifically is going to do and your injunction with the tsa well i was
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:31.140]  successful at some level in getting the policy to change down in a local
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:35.580]  courthouse in calvary rock of colorado here simply by just objecting and
[01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:39.740]  repeatedly objecting threatening to follow a lawsuit appearing on your show
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:45.060]  but never having to officially file a complaint i now walk through that area
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:48.860]  although they still have the difference is those are actual sheriff's deputies
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:53.340]  who know the law and you pointed out this violates child porn laws under 18 i
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:58.020]  mean i mean the problem is with tsa they can find dumb down people that will be
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:03.180]  radiated like rabbi kids genitals and i was happy to know that when i went on a
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:08.340]  vacation in the summer to my hometown of eagle river alaska that the video that
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:13.500]  we had posted with regard to that event helped change the policy in anchorage
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.620]  where the lawyers were in an uproar about the body scanner that was going
[01:02:17.620 --> 01:02:21.620]  into that courthouse though we've had some success with it but i've seen this
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:26.220]  particular issue as you have coming down the pipe for a long time so when it
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:31.060]  finally happened to me i waited for approximately six weeks the national
[01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:35.260]  outcry developed and i did not think that i was gonna have to file a lawsuit i
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.220]  thought they were going to change but they not only did not change but they
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:44.140]  buckled down even further so i began to prepare my complaint which you can find
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:49.500]  at information liberation dot com and i noted something um that i wanted to talk
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:53.260]  about for many years if you read the fourth amendment it says the right of
[01:02:53.260 --> 01:02:58.460]  the people to be secure in their person against unreasonable search and seizure
[01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:02.700]  shall not be violent so the fourth amendment is not a right extended to
[01:03:02.700 --> 01:03:08.060]  all persons like the fifth amendment it it's the right of the people i entered
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:12.980]  the san diego airport with my passport i work hard to get that passport and i
[01:03:12.980 --> 01:03:17.380]  know you have one out but if you put to the first page of that passport it says
[01:03:17.380 --> 01:03:22.420]  the secretary of state of the united states of america hereby request all
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:27.060]  whom it may concern to permit the citizen of the united states named here in
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:32.660]  the past without delay or interest i have an official passport when i show
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:37.780]  that passport to the tsa they can swipe it they can check me for what it is a
[01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:44.060]  lawful it is a lawful command and their and their little flimsy made-up
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:49.340]  regulation does not trump the the the order well we've been doing this sort of
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.780]  procedure now for approximately 40 years i was eight years old when i took my
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.580]  first flight and i got to walk to the plane and it wasn't there long after
[01:03:57.580 --> 01:04:01.860]  that these metal detectors were were introduced to us but they were
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:06.460]  specifically designed and engineered not to touch it that's the whole point of
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:10.260]  the wand that's the whole point of the freestanding metal detector so that you
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:14.340]  can walk through it i want to make sure in the time that we have remaining to
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:20.580]  rebut this point that you don't have a right to fly that's absolute bs alex in
[01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:25.580]  this day and age how can you express yourself how can you be a musician how

[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:20.140]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:23.820]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.980]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:31.980]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.100]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related

[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:26.860]  uh is our guest and so much of what he covered 10 15 years ago
[01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.460]  the bisphen allay the danger of cell phones the gmo
[01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:34.540]  it's now all mainstream i mean it was on fox news last night all these big
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:37.500]  studies about it brain damaging and hurting children
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.260]  uh the cell phones uh and they're letting you know now
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:45.420]  so that they can say well we warned you kind of like for 50 years they told you
[01:08:45.420 --> 01:08:49.100]  tobacco was good for your lungs then suddenly well it might not be good for
[01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:53.180]  you and this is all part of a larger program of eugenics but we'll get his
[01:08:53.180 --> 01:08:57.580]  take on that and go through a laundry list of issues but this is so important
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:01.900]  because these are things we can do things about 10 years ago you couldn't find
[01:09:01.900 --> 01:09:05.900]  organic food and stores now people demand it it's supplanting
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:09.020]  you know all the other gmo stuff so the government's moving in saying they
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:13.420]  don't want you to have to label gmo or gmo salmon
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.300]  it's the same thing on bisphen allay being pulled out all over the place we're

[01:13:10.860 --> 01:13:14.620]  for folks to know about you may not know who you are

[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:40.060]  and you have made a significant milestones in your mission to bring

[01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:47.100]  new york times best-selling author dr marcola was also involved in 2009
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.820]  ultimate wellness game changer by the huffington post
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:53.340]  and has been featured in time magazine la time cnn fox news
[01:13:53.340 --> 01:13:56.860]  uh you name it we're honored to have you with us again marcola
[01:13:56.860 --> 01:14:01.420]  m-e-r-c-o-l-a.com and the the reason you're the most
[01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:04.700]  respected of all the alternative health researchers in my opinion
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:08.460]  is because you just go off the real research and there's so much to cover
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:13.020]  but what can you say about i mean my view i don't know
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.740]  what's your view but certainly from what i see on the ground
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:20.380]  there is a collapse of confidence in the system
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.740]  everything we talked about last year about the h1n1 lowering
[01:14:23.740 --> 01:14:28.540]  your immunity being dangerous that's now mainstream news british medical journal
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:35.100]  i mean there is a collapse of confidence in this corrupt system
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:39.740]  and the establishment is responding in a lot of strange ways but it does look
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:43.180]  like the dam has broken what's your view on that
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.380]  well i think we're making progress there still is a
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.580]  a large contingency of the public who is still
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:54.540]  a fool to deceive by the very effective marketing tactics that these industry
[01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:57.660]  employ i mean they they literally generate many tens of hundreds of
[01:14:57.660 --> 01:15:00.460]  billions of dollars in profit and they're able to
[01:15:00.460 --> 01:15:04.380]  really hire the most sophisticated and clever
[01:15:04.380 --> 01:15:07.820]  marketers on the planet so they it's a really sophisticated system it's really
[01:15:07.820 --> 01:15:11.660]  difficult to break out of that mold but once you yourself have an injury or
[01:15:11.660 --> 01:15:14.620]  the system fails you then you're really seeking
[01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:19.020]  more more sound logical rational alternatives that really don't rely on
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:24.460]  extensive and toxic approaches that could could literally kill you
[01:15:24.460 --> 01:15:29.500]  and i see the statistics in the numbers of 300 000 dying from drug
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.980]  interactions uh hundreds of thousands from infections
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:37.500]  i mean boy i i tell you this mainline health care
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.540]  uh is one of the biggest killers out there rivaling
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:45.100]  even automobile accidents on your radar screen what do you see as the biggest
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:47.820]  threats out there is it sodium fluoride in the water
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:52.300]  bisphenol a gmo uh cell phone radiation i mean
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:55.340]  you cover it all the stuff as i said earlier you were covering
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:16:00.460]  10 years ago is now just all over the mainstream news
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:04.140]  well it's a good question i'm not sure if there's anyone that sticks out it's
[01:16:04.140 --> 01:16:08.860]  really a combination of them but i i think probably just a concept in the
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:12.620]  belief that the traditional model is the approach for
[01:16:12.620 --> 01:16:17.820]  health care challenges that that is the relying on a drug and we're bombarded
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:23.340]  on that of course from the media they spend over 16 billion dollars a year
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:27.340]  to do direct to consumer advertising on tv and you know the united states is only
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:30.700]  one of two countries of the world that allows that we're even legal
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.700]  so it's really they really manipulated the public to
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.980]  the belief system that this is the approach because these drugs are
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:42.140]  are almost universally uh going to cause some type of side effect if not
[01:16:42.140 --> 01:16:46.220]  doubt i mean it's routine i mean a body has just killed 80 000 people
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.380]  before that buy it killed 60 000 and and these are the ones that we know
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.020]  that that are really getting the views i mean there's
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:56.700]  dozens of others that are that are less toxic so
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:01.020]  and it's simple and it's so much it's choosing that system and that approach
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:05.980]  and you're ignoring the the basic practical strategies that one can
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:09.180]  can use which of course doesn't generate profit and revenue for these large
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:12.060]  industries so i think it's a belief in that model
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:16.700]  that's the most dangerous the most dangerous threat yeah
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:20.940]  well i agree with you and when i watch these drug ads
[01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:24.780]  it's it's absurd it's like they're openly admitting this drug is probably
[01:17:24.780 --> 01:17:27.660]  going to kill you oh you're having trouble sleeping or you're having
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:32.060]  trouble you know needing to urinate a lot and they'll tell you 10 seconds how
[01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:35.580]  great it is but then they say it may not be right for you causes heart attacks
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:40.220]  sudden death brain damage i mean it's it's it's bizarre
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:45.020]  uh and and then ask your doctor about this drug i mean it's it's
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:49.500]  sometimes i'm pinching myself wondering if i'm having a bad dream
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.420]  it's almost seems to okay just like it really is if you go to any other country
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:55.660]  in the world you're not going to see an entity except for australia
[01:17:55.660 --> 01:17:59.500]  there's only two countries in the world that allow that
[01:17:59.980 --> 01:18:04.380]  let's start and they you know it really you know you look at these and it's been
[01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:08.540]  on for 15 years but prior to 1995 those ads did not exist in the media it was
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:11.580]  illegal but then they they lobby congress and that we're able to get
[01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:16.460]  permission to air those meanwhile they're always waging war
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:20.940]  uh against uh alternative medicine or even vitamins and minerals now they're
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:25.820]  demonizing you know vitamin d it just gets crazier and crazier
[01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:29.580]  well it wasn't so much it's demonizing but the institute of medicine came out
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.900]  with a report last week which really is
[01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:38.300]  potentially ignored the the the stacks of new studies and research that
[01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:41.500]  promote that established vitamin d is a very useful
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:47.260]  uh approach and over 2 000 diseases and they only focus on bone health which
[01:18:47.260 --> 01:18:50.140]  we've known about for about a hundred years and they ignored all the rest of
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.660]  the research and virtually no vitamin d experts were on the panel
[01:18:53.660 --> 01:18:58.220]  it was really a travesty so you know it's hard to nail a specific conspiracy
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.580]  but there's some actually lawsuits against this this recommendation
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:05.260]  because it's really deceiving the public and
[01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:09.020]  not allowing them to fully utilize this incredible resource which is
[01:19:09.020 --> 01:19:12.620]  about one of the least expensive vitamins you can possibly purchase and
[01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:15.580]  one that has probably the most significant impact on your health
[01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:19.260]  sure but i mean by demonize i was thinking of dr dina del
[01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:22.940]  uh who i mean i listened to him and just
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:25.740]  almost everything he says is patently false and
[01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:29.820]  he was just flipping out and saying that you know it's bad to take most
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:33.500]  vitamins and then we don't need them but but then i look at all the studies
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.740]  about vitamin and mineral deficiency and what a big
[01:19:35.740 --> 01:19:39.820]  problem is when we come back i want to discuss
[01:19:39.820 --> 01:19:42.540]  a lot of the articles that are at murkola.com
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:46.620]  pregnant women should minimize exposure to cell phones i want to look at that
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:49.820]  i want to look at all these reports of different chemicals
[01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.100]  that are in plastics that we are eating our foods out of and
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:57.820]  what that's causing ways that from your research are the best ways to detox
[01:19:57.820 --> 01:20:01.180]  all the thyroid problems we'll talk about it with dr murkola

[01:24:25.900 --> 01:24:29.820]  doc going through the articles that i see you
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:32.300]  posting and and that your great researchers are putting together that
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:36.220]  link to all the mainline medical studies that are out there
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:40.300]  it's not just bisphenol a we've got to worry about you've been reporting on
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:44.940]  the other chemicals that are in the liners of the
[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:49.020]  wrappers around hamburgers and other things that are causing serious problems
[01:24:49.020 --> 01:24:52.940]  can you go over what bisphenol a and now these other chemicals are and what the
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:56.460]  studies show they're doing well the article you're referring to we posted
[01:24:56.460 --> 01:25:00.540]  last week a study that came out that showed that these wrappers which are
[01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:03.020]  usually put in place to prevent the grease and
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:07.100]  oil in the fast food from leaking out that they would if you use regular
[01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:10.620]  paper uh... that is the sticky coating that you see
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:14.860]  some of it too also on the microwave a microwaveable popcorn
[01:25:14.860 --> 01:25:18.460]  so these the way they're able to do that is really similar to how they achieve a
[01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.820]  nonstick surface which is they put a fluorinated chemical
[01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:25.500]  compound and this uh... flooring compound
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:29.100]  uh... actually that those kids and in the microwave into the food
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.700]  so you're actually eating these these compounds when you do that that's
[01:25:32.700 --> 01:25:36.620]  definitely not going to be flooring that sounds like fluoride
[01:25:36.620 --> 01:25:39.820]  yes well it's a fluoride compound there's no question why they just love to
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.620]  give us fluoride i guess because they love us
[01:25:42.620 --> 01:25:46.140]  well it's pretty useful chemical it's a really interesting uh... innovation to
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:50.700]  have a material that you could thrive food with and not to pick but it
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:54.380]  it does it at quite a price you know i use typically when i'm lecturing to
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:57.740]  people if they have any nonstick finishes to
[01:25:57.740 --> 01:26:01.820]  either find a relative or a neighbor they don't like to give it to them because
[01:26:01.820 --> 01:26:05.740]  the stuff is toxic attack but actually it's not that toxic as long as you don't
[01:26:05.740 --> 01:26:08.060]  hate it but the moment you hate it you start to
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:12.380]  volatilize this this fluoride and it goes into a gas and it can
[01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.620]  cause health problems and it's so much so that
[01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:18.460]  if you're in a closed environment you can actually kill cat birds
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:22.220]  i mean this stuff is really toxic oh i'm sure it's an accident they're doing
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.500]  this also the report on the bisphenol a is in
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.460]  most or 40 percent and they said oh 60 percent
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:31.820]  of the of the printer ink so i guess i'm touching it right here
[01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:34.300]  right now i mean this stuff is just everywhere
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:38.060]  well and it's sort of stealth too and when you go to the grocery store and you
[01:26:38.060 --> 01:26:42.220]  get these receipts it's on those receipts so you know you
[01:26:42.220 --> 01:26:46.060]  want to be really minimize your contact with those
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:49.420]  now the good news is what four states have passed laws to start restricting
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:52.220]  this at least for children they're pointing out that it's in the baby
[01:26:52.220 --> 01:26:56.940]  bottles is again you did a decade ago plus uh so we're starting to move in a
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:27:01.420]  good direction but now we're finding out that this stuff is just everywhere
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:05.420]  it's pervasive there's no question it is and aside from the bisphenol a
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:08.620]  you have the phthalates which is a chemical that's added in the
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:12.140]  manufacturing of plastic to make it pliable so any plastic
[01:27:12.140 --> 01:27:15.820]  that's flexible will have these phthalates in there that's another
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:20.300]  chemical that's loaded with complication that that also should be bad
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:24.460]  well from my research correct me if i'm wrong uh a large percentage of petro
[01:27:24.460 --> 01:27:29.580]  chemical waste uh you know in some cases up to 30 percent of
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:33.580]  crude oil they have to get rid of and so they just created industries for the
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:36.940]  distillates what was left and that that's where most of this
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.980]  stuff comes from it's petrochemical uh
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:45.980]  leavings and so they just put it into our food chain and they charge it's a pretty
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:47.900]  price for it too just as very similar what they've
[01:27:47.900 --> 01:27:51.180]  done with with fluoride waste products which is a common
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:54.540]  waste material in the manufacture of aluminum
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:57.980]  well i'm not the you know leading alternative health
[01:27:57.980 --> 01:28:00.940]  research director out there like you are but i do
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:05.580]  talk to the public i do see things in mainstream media i hear women talking
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:10.860]  on radio i hear women talking in grocery stores women's magazines i read them
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:15.180]  uh it's got to be a third or more of the women young women are having thyroid
[01:28:15.180 --> 01:28:20.540]  problems their hair is falling out uh is that a cocktail of chemicals
[01:28:20.540 --> 01:28:23.260]  with this epidemic of women's hair falling out
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:27.100]  uh well there's two primary ones that are that are
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:30.300]  culprits and they tend to be these these halogens uh
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:33.420]  it's important to understand that iodine is an important mineral that we need
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:36.860]  for thyroid function but it's easily displaced by these other halogen
[01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:40.460]  chemicals that are elements such as fluoride
[01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:44.780]  and also bromide so fluoride is it's becoming pervasive and
[01:28:44.780 --> 01:28:48.060]  clearly the most common sources of the water supply but but fluoridated
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:51.260]  toothpaste it's also another issue so when you're consuming that and you're
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:56.460]  consuming most bleached flowers it's bleached with bromide so
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:29:00.620]  almost all the flour out there is brominated so these bromide
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:05.180]  bromine and fluoride ions displace the iodine for the thyroid and as a result
[01:29:05.180 --> 01:29:08.940]  you can't form thyroid hormone because that's that's what's part of the thyroid
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:12.060]  hormone is iodide so that's that's the mechanism
[01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:15.740]  uh soy is also another pervasive one that's that's really
[01:29:15.740 --> 01:29:19.180]  is it there's a there's a hormone in there called isoflavone
[01:29:19.180 --> 01:29:21.500]  which actually acts as a
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:23.820]  parathyroid health so the combination of the
[01:29:23.820 --> 01:29:26.940]  these fluoride bromide and soy are probably the biggest culprits for
[01:29:26.940 --> 01:29:30.540]  unbelievable stay there dr long segment coming up i want to continue
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:35.420]  going through this so what do women and men and others who are losing all their hair they're becoming
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:55.340]  obesity they're not eating a lot why why i mean how do you reverse this uh and is there a way to clean it out well we'll be right back folks fluoride fluoride everywhere and no clean food or water for us to drink
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:30:03.340]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:29.260]  tried so we got out and said well up to two weeks ago
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:20.440]  the
[01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:26.480]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:31.120]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:34.640]  solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:40.880]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:42.520]  digestive system.

[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:04.960]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:09.560]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:11.240]  and operated American company.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:16.040]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love
[01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:18.720]  these products for bath, air, laundry, and dishes.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:22.680]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving triple-concentrated soaps
[01:31:22.680 --> 01:31:23.680]  anywhere.

[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:36.400]  Let's talk to the owner of 5-star soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:31:36.400 --> 01:31:43.040]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:47.200]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.200]  Thank you.
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:04.560]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:05.560]  Terany is here.
[01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:09.440]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:32:09.440 --> 01:32:12.120]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:16.640]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.900]  on earth.
[01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:22.720]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.560]  expanded nationwide.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:29.240]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:30.600]  shadow state.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.680]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:39.120]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:44.200]  Police cameras, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:45.200]  corner.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:48.440]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plunder.
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:50.480]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:32:50.480 --> 01:32:51.480]  It's here.

[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:11.320]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:17.240]  So Dr. Mark Cola, you get the same intel that I'm receiving.
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:21.080]  They admit in the media that thyroid dysfunctions off the charts, perhaps you can talk about
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:26.640]  those numbers, but just women everywhere, talk show hosts, you name it, young women,
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.640]  I hear them talking about it and I see women all over the place.
[01:33:29.640 --> 01:33:32.040]  You can see their hair falling out.
[01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:38.000]  How much more obvious does this poisoned environment have to get?
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:39.640]  Please continue breaking that down.
[01:33:39.640 --> 01:33:43.920]  Well, the bulk of the people that experience it are women.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:48.000]  My guess is it's certainly the majority of women, but perhaps 75-80% of women have some
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  challenge with it.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:53.400]  And if your listeners are interested in finding out if they have a problem, you can certainly
[01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:57.960]  go online, our website, or Google it and find out what the symptoms are, but there's a blood
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:02.160]  test you can take, it's called TSH, which is short for Thyroid Stimulia and Hormonin.
[01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:07.280]  Of course, the normal conventional lab tests, normal ranges are off, but if your lumbar comes
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:13.440]  back below 1.5, then it's okay, but above 1.5, it'll be most likely you have a problem,
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:18.240]  but you'll be told that you're okay if it's below 5, so there's this range where almost
[01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:23.560]  all the conventional doctors are misunderstanding and misinterpreting the results, so it's far
[01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:26.400]  more common than traditionally believed.
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:32.160]  So what do you do? Get off these things that have the fluorines and fluorides in it, stop
[01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:37.320]  using the non-stick, stop drinking out of the bisphine all day, stop drinking the Florida
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:41.240]  water, stop bathing in it, I mean, are there ways to heal?
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:46.440]  The fluoride toothpaste and the flour, you can't have brominated flour, that's definitely
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.440]  a...
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:50.280]  So no white flour, no bleach flour?
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:55.040]  Right, bro, it'll say brominated on it, so though you have to stop the assault to your
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:35:00.160]  body, that's one, but then the detoxification can be somewhat of a challenge, and the key
[01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:05.040]  thing is if you have serious thyroid issues, most likely you're placed on a synthetic version
[01:35:05.040 --> 01:35:10.800]  of thyroid hormone, which is called a most commonly finthrite or levophrite, but these
[01:35:10.800 --> 01:35:16.120]  are not the best, the best is a natural thyroid hormone, which is called typically armor thyroid
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:22.720]  or desiccated thyroid, which will solve the problem and will allow you to start a process.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.120]  Is that the one that's from Cal's?
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:29.640]  Yes, it's typically from Cal's, right, or PIG, I think it's from PIG, it's porcine,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:32.400]  it's from PIG, the most commonly one's from PIG, yeah.
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:37.400]  I don't know, I just did some research and saw them promoting and selling desiccated Cal
[01:35:37.400 --> 01:35:39.400]  thyroid, but I'm saying...
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:43.400]  I think it's a better one, but it's somewhat hard to find, yes, the most armor thyroid
[01:35:43.400 --> 01:35:45.880]  is from PIG.
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:50.600]  And I guess you go to a doctor or clinic and they test your blood?
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:54.640]  Those are prescription, yeah, most of the time you're going to get the test through a licensed
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.120]  healthcare professional, and those specific supplements do have to be prescription, at
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.120]  least in the United States.
[01:36:00.120 --> 01:36:04.200]  Of course, you can be creative and go online and purchase these things overseas without
[01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.200]  a prescription.
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:10.240]  And then the women start to see their hair come back from the research I've looked at,
[01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:13.560]  but you notice when you search these terms, you mainly find people that want to do hair
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:20.240]  restoration or they want to sell you mudoxidil, they don't want to tell you, it's just like
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.360]  mainline medical science, they want to treat the illness instead of, or treat the symptoms
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:29.080]  instead of actually treating the underlying cause, correct?
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.760]  That tends to be the common pattern, yes.
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:33.600]  Boy, that is cold-blooded.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:37.680]  So for all you women out there wondering why your hair is falling out at age 30, now you
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:43.200]  know, are there any other causal things that people can knock out?
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.680]  And from your research, I mean, how much of the women's hair comes back?
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:53.160]  Well, it's variable, a good percentage of them will, and one of the other components
[01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:58.560]  that really is an important element, and really what I believe is the primary cause of obesity
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:03.800]  in this country, and it's clear and obvious that you walk down any urban area, city, and
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:05.880]  you'll find that two or three people are overweight.
[01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:10.440]  I mean, it's really massive, but epidemic that we're going in, and it's relatively
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:11.440]  recent.
[01:37:11.440 --> 01:37:19.640]  It's related to the manufacture of fructose from, done cheaply when they figured out how
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:25.080]  to do that in the mid-70s, and it's just pervaded the food supply, so this fructose
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:27.680]  is a sugar, it's just absolutely horrendous.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:32.960]  Now, let's talk about high fructose, because now they're running ads where the smart woman,
[01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.560]  because they know women buy about 80% of the products, it's always a woman telling a man
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:42.040]  off or telling another woman off that, oh, it's a conspiracy theory that high fructose
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.040]  is bad.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:48.160]  Corn syrup is good for you, but then there's all these mainline studies with the diabetes
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.360]  and what it does to our metabolic systems.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:56.640]  Dr. Marcola, break down what the high fructose is doing, why it's different from sugar.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:01.920]  Well, sugar or sucrose, which you can get from cane to beet, it used to be the common
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:05.400]  way that we got sugar in this country, is to really similar, there's not a lot of difference
[01:38:05.400 --> 01:38:12.000]  between the two, because simple sugar is 50% fructose and 50% glucose or dextrose.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:16.160]  So, from that perspective, it's a problem, and if you get high fructose corn syrup,
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.960]  it's about the same ratio.
[01:38:17.960 --> 01:38:21.880]  There are two differences, one is in high fructose corn syrup, it's a simple sugar
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:26.200]  and it's dissociated, it's not bonded together with the glucose, so it's absorbed a little
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:32.720]  more quickly, but the primary reason why it's such a problem is it's so darn cheap, and
[01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:36.880]  food manufacturers are putting it into everything, so the numbers are going through the roof
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880]  of what people are consuming.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.960]  You know, in 1900, Alex, the average person only consumed about 15 grams of fructose and
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:49.520]  that was mostly in the form of healthy fruits, but now about 25% of the population is consuming
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:55.280]  more than 135 grams a day, well more than 10 times what the average person was consuming
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:57.160]  a mere 100 years ago.
[01:38:57.160 --> 01:39:01.760]  So it has significant metabolic problems, so if you have a problem that's challenged
[01:39:01.760 --> 01:39:05.600]  with this diet, or really any health problem, cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, high
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:09.640]  cholesterol, one of the most important things you can do is get off the fructose and the
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:10.640]  most common...
[01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:13.040]  You know, this is really a shock, and I'm sure many of your listeners realize it's the
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:18.720]  most common source of calories in the United States, most common source is fructose, typically
[01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:24.040]  in the form of a soda, so that's a simple thing to eliminate, and once you get that
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:28.120]  out of your diet, then, you know, your health starts moving in the right direction, so you
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:32.000]  gotta hit the basics, it's really essential.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:38.800]  Oh, wow, Dr. Joseph Merkola is our guest, and we're gonna tell you more about his website
[01:39:38.800 --> 01:39:43.640]  as we talk to him, I wanna go to some calls here soon, it's at merkola.com, take control
[01:39:43.640 --> 01:39:48.080]  of your health, just amazing research and information.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.120]  More and more mainline studies are having to admit in the U.S. and Europe, as you know,
[01:39:53.120 --> 01:39:59.480]  that frequency pollution is a big problem, and that the studies are showing, with pregnant
[01:39:59.480 --> 01:40:06.400]  women, you name it, it's really causing serious issues with the fetuses.
[01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:11.400]  From your wide spectrum research, give us your brief take on frequency pollution.
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:17.800]  Well, these are definitely a challenge, because we're going to have an explosion, most people
[01:40:17.800 --> 01:40:21.920]  don't realize that cell phones are relatively recent innovation, you know, before 25 years
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:27.560]  ago, they didn't exist anywhere in the world, and, you know, I think it was in the mid-90s
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:32.880]  or late-90s, we had a billion cell phones, and then we're up to 4 billion now, so, this
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:37.920]  is a relatively recent exposure to this radiation, and just like smoking, I think it's really
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:45.680]  the most powerful, simple analogy, these exposures don't cause a problem, intuitively, in other
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:50.160]  words, it takes time to have this exposure before you're gonna notice the difference.
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.040]  You don't get lung cancer after smoking one pack of cigarettes, you know, it takes many
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:58.320]  years, if not decades, to have that exposure before you have a problem and a complication,
[01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:03.800]  so similarly, exposure to these cell phones is going to take 5, 10, 20, 30 years before
[01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:07.600]  you're gonna see an increase in the consequences and the health problems, and the primary ones
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:12.400]  are gonna be brain cancers, and we've already seen this today, but it's going to be exploding,
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:16.800]  it's gonna be just like lung cancer, we're gonna see an explosion in brain cancers because
[01:41:16.800 --> 01:41:19.560]  of the use of these cell phone devices.
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:23.280]  Well it's being reported, again, like AP Reuters, you name it, that they're already
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:29.080]  seeing that, and then you'll see the cell phone makers come out and say, well, we don't
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:34.720]  completely agree with that, and it's not conclusive, it sounds just like the cigarette makers even
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:39.440]  a decade ago, saying, we didn't know this caused cancer, we're not even saying it does
[01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:44.360]  cause cancer, and you go back 50 years ago, they said, they had doctors on TV and lab
[01:41:44.360 --> 01:41:49.960]  coats going, having a sore throat, smoke and extra merit.
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:54.440]  And the telecommunications industry is a far bigger and more powerful industry than the
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:57.960]  smoky, than the tobacco industry, there's no comparison, I think it may be one order
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:04.200]  of magnitude larger, so they have a lot more income and power to play with and manipulate
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.400]  the perception.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.240]  What are some of the, there's so many things to talk about, what are some of the other
[01:42:11.240 --> 01:42:15.120]  things that are on your radar?
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:21.440]  Well I really believe that the reliance on drugs as a solution for health is a problem.
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.520]  One of the primary issues that we face, and the most significant concern is that it's
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:33.720]  becoming progressively more expensive for the drug companies to actually have these
[01:42:33.720 --> 01:42:38.000]  drugs approved, and then even once they're approved, then they have to defend lawsuits
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:41.640]  typically resulting in billions, if not tens of billions of dollars for the consequence
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:42.960]  of people taking them.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:47.160]  So there's this gradual, because of those two elements, there's this gradual shift
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:52.400]  towards a model where they're not using drugs anymore, they're going to be using vaccines,
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:59.920]  which because of the legislation passed 25 years ago, they are exempted from any prosecution,
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:06.600]  and they're a lot easier to pass, so they're going to manipulate the whole system so that
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:11.880]  they're actually not voluntary, so that they become mandatory, so there's tens of billions
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.160]  of dollars a profit, there's this gradual shift, I mean there's probably hundreds or
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:21.280]  more vaccines that are in the pipeline right now for portarty for our population, and
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:22.600]  that's a big concern.
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:26.680]  I just learned something new, I mean I know about all the new classes of vaccines that
[01:43:26.680 --> 01:43:34.200]  cure depression, and that's on quotes, or smoking, or cocaine, or anger, or vaccines
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:38.720]  that make you calm and not have anxiety anymore, and I go read the different patents, most
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:44.080]  of them are literally genetically engineered viruses, or the equivalent of nanotech, that
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:50.720]  go in and destroy the neurons so that you can't even receive those different chemicals
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:51.720]  in your brain.
[01:43:51.720 --> 01:43:59.240]  I mean this is the equivalent of a viral lobotomy, they have other types that create plaques,
[01:43:59.240 --> 01:44:04.040]  other types that then attack hormones, and I want you to speak to this, but I had never
[01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:05.880]  put two and two together.
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:10.000]  That's why they admit they're moving almost exclusively to vaccines, because that'll be
[01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:16.720]  the new delivery system via manipulation of your body, of pharmacia, and they've got
[01:44:16.720 --> 01:44:22.320]  this body of law with the vaccine damage fund, and the national security angle, that is
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.960]  nightmare, so what specifically can you say about them coming out and saying, look we
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:31.840]  got a vaccine that will cure you being upset, but then it blocks your endorphins, I mean
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:32.840]  this is scary.
[01:44:32.840 --> 01:44:37.640]  Well, it's just immunity from prosecution that's the most concerned, because they can
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.400]  really tell these things, and in the case of last year of the twilight, which I think
[01:44:41.400 --> 01:44:45.280]  is, our site's been around for 12 years, but I think our most significant contribution
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:50.840]  is really being a primary catalyst for educating consumers that the vaccine was not sent, and
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:56.560]  as a result of that, 70% of the US public chose not to get the vaccine despite the president
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560]  coming out.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:45:01.200]  And you were vindicated because everything you, and many others talked about, came out
[01:45:01.200 --> 01:45:02.960]  to be absolutely right and wrong.
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:06.480]  Sure, the right is, it's so easy to predict these things out, I mean, especially with
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:11.080]  the flu, because all we have to do is look at Australia, which is literally six months
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:14.960]  ahead of us, and you look at their experience, and we're going to exactly replicate it, there's
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.960]  no mystery.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:16.960]  It's not rocket science.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:21.960]  That's right, they had deaths, they had massive brain damage, old neurological.
[01:45:21.960 --> 01:45:25.160]  And they didn't have the epidemics that they were projecting, so I mean, you can predict
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:29.160]  these things six months ahead, so it's virtually 100% accuracy, but they don't want you to
[01:45:29.160 --> 01:45:30.160]  understand that.
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.760]  So, it's pretty simple stuff once you understand the basics.
[01:45:33.760 --> 01:45:42.800]  Right, currently if I'm wrong, almost all flus start in the other hemisphere or in Asia.
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:48.120]  So we really should always know what type of flu is coming around the bend, and any
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:49.120]  type of...
[01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:53.680]  And the flu or any infectious disease, for the most part, is not something to be distressed
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:57.040]  about, because if you're following Healthy Life's Dozen, if you go to my site, just on
[01:45:57.040 --> 01:46:01.920]  the homepage, we've got a whole 40-page report on how you can, and there's no charge for
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:06.320]  how you can optimize your lifestyle based on beginner, intermediate, advanced models.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:09.400]  And one of the most important things you can do is optimize your vitamin D levels.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:14.640]  We touched on it earlier, but if your vitamin D levels are normal or optimal, over 50 nanograms
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:19.520]  per milliliter, you're going to be resistant to the vast majority of infectious diseases.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:22.360]  If you're cutting out the sugar and you're exercising, you're sleeping well, drinking
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:27.200]  water, staying away from toxins, it's virtually impossible to get sick.
[01:46:27.200 --> 01:46:28.360]  I mean, just don't get sick.
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:29.840]  You don't forget about the vaccine.
[01:46:29.840 --> 01:46:32.000]  You don't have to worry about even any downtime.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:36.280]  The cost of colds or flus in the winter comes, and I can't tell you, it's just almost universal
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:41.080]  the responses that we get from people who adopt these strategies and change your lifestyle,
[01:46:41.080 --> 01:46:45.500]  and they can experience this relief from these infectious diseases.
[01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:50.520]  But then going back to what happened last year, as you know, but I'd like you to speak
[01:46:50.520 --> 01:46:56.040]  to this doctor, Merkola, they did Canadian studies and others that showed if you took
[01:46:56.040 --> 01:47:04.680]  the H1N1 vaccine, it lowered your immunity by 50% to the regular seasonal, quantify that
[01:47:04.680 --> 01:47:11.160]  from what Dr. Blalock and others have said here, medical doctors, that basically your
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:15.440]  body gets overwhelmed, then it doesn't know how to respond to a real threat.
[01:47:15.440 --> 01:47:16.520]  You're absolutely correct.
[01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:23.040]  If you get the swine flu, the studies have conclusively proven that it actually increases
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.240]  your risk for getting the regular seasonal flu.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.360]  So what do you think they did in the United States and I think in most of the countries
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:33.760]  of the world with the flu vaccine this year, they combine them both and you don't have
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.760]  a choice.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:35.760]  If you get one, you get the other.
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:41.080]  So it's beyond crazy what they're doing, but it makes perfect sense if you're one of
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:45.160]  the executives of the drug industry because you're going to be reaping profit.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:47.760]  And obviously they want a captive audience.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:51.800]  They go lobby billions of dollars to your state and federal legislature and more and
[01:47:51.800 --> 01:47:56.760]  more we're seeing the government attempt to try to force vaccines on people and they're
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.680]  coming out with hundreds of new vaccines.
[01:47:58.680 --> 01:48:03.680]  As you pointed out, medicine is shifting over almost entirely to vaccines because of the
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:05.500]  liability protection.
[01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:12.480]  This is a nightmare, but at the same time, record low numbers of people took the flu
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:15.680]  shot, it's starting to the same thing this year.
[01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.600]  How do you see the system striking back?
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:22.640]  I mean, they want to make their hundreds of billions and because of Merkola and infowars.com
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:26.400]  and all the other great people out there, folks are waking up.
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:28.200]  What do you see the establishment doing?
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:33.360]  So I don't know, I don't really get into those projections too much, but you know, they're
[01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:34.360]  going to come out.
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:37.160]  I mean, they're going to want to try, I think the immediate threat is they're going to make
[01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:43.040]  it mandatory and we're partnering with one of the top pro vaccine safety sites in the
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:48.240]  world, which is the National Vaccine Information Center, NDIC.org, and we're really developing
[01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.360]  a massive consumer awareness component where they were lobbying for people to get together
[01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:56.360]  in their own local communities and hit their state legislator.
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:49:00.880]  So they will prevent this from happening, but I think that's the next big battle is
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:05.480]  to make sure right now that we don't shift to a mandatory vaccine system because right
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:10.320]  now we have the freedom to choose not to get them, even though there are essentially the
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.720]  freedom to somewhat nullified if you have a child that's going to school because they're
[01:49:13.720 --> 01:49:16.960]  going to prevent entry into most schools that must be vaccinated, but you can always
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:20.880]  home school or you can go to a state that doesn't require and has a philosophical exemption.
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:25.280]  So it's, you know, it's not as bad as it could be, I'm sure, if they get these mandatory
[01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:27.400]  vaccine laws get passed.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.400]  We're going to break her in a moment.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:34.560]  We're going to come back and take a few calls for Dr. Joseph Merkola, but briefly, what
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:42.240]  are you seeing on the front of GMO crops, cross species, chimeras, like the GMO salmon,
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:45.480]  the move to not even let us know of its GMO in the stores?
[01:49:45.480 --> 01:49:47.680]  Well, it's a big, big issue.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:49.680]  I think we're going to be very successful in that.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:53.440]  We're partnering with Jeffrey Smith, who has just done Dr. Oz yesterday and got a very
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:57.120]  favorable response, but it's just providing people, the consumers can make the choice here
[01:49:57.120 --> 01:50:01.160]  if they can vote with their pocketbooks once they understand the issue, they can actually
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:06.760]  choose not to purchase this, and just like they did in Europe, once their profits go
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:10.760]  down, the people who are, the industries who were manufacturing this, they will choose
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:11.760]  not to.
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:15.520]  So we can easily defeat that without any legislation, without any governmental intervention.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.160]  It's a really simple process.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:18.160]  Amazing.
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.880]  Dr. Merkola is our guest.
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.840]  Briefly, as we go to break, what are some of the other things that you're looking at
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:24.840]  right now?
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.960]  Well, that's one of the most exciting ones, fluoride is a big issue, and then also mercury,
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:33.640]  which is another toxin of course, and we work with Charlie Brown for the consumers for dental
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:40.280]  choice to help outlaw mercury amalgam in the United States, which is one of our big projects.
[01:50:40.280 --> 01:50:46.040]  So Free Humanity is on the march, but Big Pharma and their, which Dr. Cartel's, they're striking
[01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:47.040]  back.
[01:50:47.040 --> 01:50:48.040]  I'm Alex Jones.

[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.760]  and I'm going to get into big news blitz on WikiLeaks, the economy, and a lot more.

[01:55:56.240 --> 01:56:01.820]  The other system, there's two, has 20 times at least, and you can look at the images released
[01:56:01.820 --> 01:56:02.820]  by the government.
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:04.820]  You can see the bones and the fingers.
[01:56:04.820 --> 01:56:10.940]  That's similar to a dental x-ray, so these are very high-powered, and I mean, there's
[01:56:10.940 --> 01:56:14.020]  no doubt that it's a serious issue.
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:16.660]  It just shows how crazy this has gotten.
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:18.060]  Let's talk to Steve in Florida.
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:19.540]  You're on the air with Dr. Merkola.
[01:56:19.540 --> 01:56:20.540]  Go ahead.
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:21.540]  Good afternoon.
[01:56:21.540 --> 01:56:22.540]  Good afternoon, Dr. Merkola.
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:28.540]  Dr. Merkola, before I ask the question, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:29.540]  what you've been doing.
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:34.980]  I get your daily e-newsletter, and I've been able to pass on so much of your information
[01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:39.460]  to people through e-mails or just talking to them, and I just really appreciate all
[01:56:39.460 --> 01:56:44.140]  the work you've done and the documentation you've put out to back up what you're saying.
[01:56:44.140 --> 01:56:50.140]  The thing I wanted to ask is this, my chiropractor who's very much on the same page with you
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:54.820]  as far as all the nutritional stuff and health stuff, he made a very radical statement.
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:57.020]  I wanted to see what you think about this.
[01:56:57.020 --> 01:57:00.140]  He said, there really is no such thing as disease.
[01:57:00.140 --> 01:57:08.300]  The problem with all these so-called diseases is you have a breakdown at the cellular level.
[01:57:08.300 --> 01:57:10.460]  So what is your take on that?
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:13.540]  Well, thank you for your kind comments.
[01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:19.020]  With respect to your chiropractor's comments, I believe it's kind of like day and night
[01:57:19.020 --> 01:57:24.700]  when there's many come to disease and health, and really the strategy that most physicians
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:28.980]  who are interested in improving people's health and focusing on wellness will focus on getting
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:29.980]  people healthy.
[01:57:29.980 --> 01:57:31.300]  I went to medical school.
[01:57:31.300 --> 01:57:34.300]  The focus was the exact converse.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:38.220]  The focus is almost entirely specifically on disease.
[01:57:38.220 --> 01:57:41.900]  So if you get a person healthy, it's really like white and darkness.
[01:57:41.900 --> 01:57:44.020]  You can't have darkness if there's light.
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:46.940]  Similarly, you can't have disease if you're healthy.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:51.460]  So I think there's many elements of truth to which Carvex said, just the perspective.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:54.260]  I mean, obviously, we're designed to die.
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:57:55.980]  It's just you can extend that out.
[01:57:55.980 --> 01:57:58.700]  So of course, everything goes to a cellular level.
[01:57:58.700 --> 01:58:04.420]  That's what we're made up of is different communities of cell tissues working in concert
[01:58:04.420 --> 01:58:07.260]  together, directed by our brain.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:11.980]  Yeah, and obviously, we're all going to die at some point, but that's one of my areas
[01:58:11.980 --> 01:58:15.980]  of interest is anti-aging, and I can tell you some of the most exciting research now
[01:58:15.980 --> 01:58:20.780]  is pointing to telomere lengthening, and telomeres are little end caps of your DNAs of pieces
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:25.260]  on the chromosome, and there's a basal rate at which they degenerate, and once you read
[01:58:25.260 --> 01:58:31.980]  a certain limit, like 5,000 end caps, appears, or face bears, actually, you die.
[01:58:31.980 --> 01:58:35.700]  So the cutting research is actually lengthening these telomeres, and you can actually reverse
[01:58:35.700 --> 01:58:37.780]  aging, which we'll probably have in 2030 years.
[01:58:37.780 --> 01:58:38.780]  Incredible.
[01:58:38.780 --> 01:58:44.620]  I want to hear about that when we come back.
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:50.340]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:54.780]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:58:54.780 --> 01:58:58.700]  You've heard me talk about the delicious, easy to fix, and very storable foods from
[01:58:58.700 --> 01:58:59.700]  eFoodsDirect.com.
[01:58:59.700 --> 01:59:05.220]  I've told you for years that eFoodsDirect has the best storable food on the planet.

[01:59:41.500 --> 01:59:59.460]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:59.460 --> 02:00:10.540]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government coverups.
[02:00:10.540 --> 02:00:11.540]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.540 --> 02:00:13.540]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.540 --> 02:00:24.060]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:35.020]  Dr. Joseph Merkola is our guest ophthalmopathic physician, previously headed up major medical
[02:00:35.020 --> 02:00:41.460]  centers, and he joins us now.
[02:00:41.460 --> 02:00:45.060]  I want to go to your phone calls, but he was bringing up life extension.
[02:00:45.060 --> 02:00:50.780]  Let's just do that in the next longer segment coming up, because I want everybody to be
[02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:53.540]  able to hear that, and some stations don't carry this short segment.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:57.900]  Very, very important information, and I know the elites are obsessed with this, and I know
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:03.900]  in rats and certain types of insects and worms, they've already doubled, tripled life expectancy.
[02:01:03.900 --> 02:01:04.900]  It's amazing.
[02:01:04.900 --> 02:01:09.020]  So we're going to discuss that with him coming up, and right now, let's go to Deborah in
[02:01:09.020 --> 02:01:10.020]  Maine.
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:11.020]  You're on the air with Dr. Merkola.
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:12.020]  Go ahead, Deborah.
[02:01:12.020 --> 02:01:13.020]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:13.020 --> 02:01:14.020]  Hi, Dr. Merkola.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.020]  Hi, Deborah.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.020]  I'm really nervous.
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:19.820]  I feel like I'm a lucky American who gets to talk to like Brad Pitt or something.
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:25.420]  It makes me sound like a geek, but I'm a huge fan, actually, of both of you, so thank
[02:01:25.420 --> 02:01:27.620]  you both of you for everything you do.
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:33.020]  Dr. Merkola, I want to ask you, I've always been pretty healthy.
[02:01:33.020 --> 02:01:36.740]  I have my own personal story with pharmaceuticals.
[02:01:36.740 --> 02:01:42.500]  I got off them because I was in a position of asking my doctor why is this happening,
[02:01:42.500 --> 02:01:44.820]  why is this happening, and they just didn't have an answer for me.
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:48.980]  Well, they've always got more drugs to treat the drug-induced problems they've given
[02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:49.980]  you.
[02:01:49.980 --> 02:01:50.980]  Yeah, that's exactly it.
[02:01:50.980 --> 02:01:57.180]  I was having epileptic seizures, like 15 years ago, I was in my early 20s, and I was
[02:01:57.180 --> 02:02:02.900]  never extremely smart or anything, but I just was like, something's wrong with this picture,
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:08.780]  and ultimately the drugs made me feel like I was drunk and stupid, and so ultimately
[02:02:08.780 --> 02:02:13.660]  I went into the doctor and said, I'm not taking these anymore, and anyway, so that was my
[02:02:13.660 --> 02:02:14.660]  own personal story.
[02:02:14.660 --> 02:02:16.900]  That's kind of how I saw the light.
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:21.500]  I read most of the books that you recommend on your website.
[02:02:21.500 --> 02:02:25.220]  My question, I'm so frustrated, I feel like I want to pull my hair out and hit people
[02:02:25.220 --> 02:02:26.620]  over the head with bricks.
[02:02:26.620 --> 02:02:29.660]  Why is it so hard for people?
[02:02:29.660 --> 02:02:34.660]  Why is it so hard to understand?
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:35.660]  About the system?
[02:02:35.660 --> 02:02:39.660]  Well, just, I find it so easy to be healthy, you know.
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:41.300]  Well, I'll tell you what's going on.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:47.220]  The average person just kind of goes through life and accepts what they're given, and
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:51.380]  they're good people, so they think if everybody else is good, they don't understand the predatory
[02:02:51.380 --> 02:02:53.260]  nature, but I appreciate your call.
[02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:55.700]  Let's get Dr. Mercola's take on what you were talking about.
[02:02:55.700 --> 02:03:01.740]  Well, that's what I referenced earlier, and I've heard that, but there's this massive
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:07.900]  media campaign and marketing that these drug companies, they're very successful at marketing.
[02:03:07.900 --> 02:03:11.940]  They have tens of hundreds of billions of dollars to purchase the finest minds of the
[02:03:11.940 --> 02:03:17.060]  planet, and they corrupt the system at every level from the journals, the publications
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:22.580]  that are accepted in the journals, to the experts that are appointed, the federal committees,
[02:03:22.580 --> 02:03:27.980]  the chairman of major departments at medical schools and universities, that are really
[02:03:27.980 --> 02:03:32.380]  heavily subsidized by the drug companies and really in debt to them, so they were able
[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:38.660]  to steer their agenda through these processes, and the media carries that, and it's no surprise
[02:03:38.660 --> 02:03:39.940]  that most people believe it.
[02:03:39.940 --> 02:03:45.180]  I mean, it's exactly what you would expect in this type of model, and it takes an extraordinary
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:50.260]  individual to get out of this, someone like yourself, who suffered complications of the
[02:03:50.260 --> 02:03:53.620]  recommendations and done your own independent research, it's there, but if you just listen
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:56.500]  to the media, you're going to be easily confused.
[02:03:56.500 --> 02:04:02.020]  Well, that's a great point, and if you look at a lot of the big drug companies, they are
[02:04:02.020 --> 02:04:07.940]  the progeny of the original snake oil salesman who were mixing opium up with alcohol and
[02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:15.540]  saying, this will cure your ails, and they don't have an incentive to want to prevent
[02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:20.540]  that disease, they want to treat the disease, and I think it's that simple equation that
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:24.540]  really boils it all down, but one quick question, we're about to go to break, come back in one
[02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:29.780]  final long segment and take more calls, I'll ask the question now, then we'll come back
[02:04:29.780 --> 02:04:36.060]  and get your answer on the other side, but I also have seen the statistics in the western
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:42.060]  world, Europe and the United States mainly, that neurological disorders, early onset of
[02:04:42.060 --> 02:04:50.620]  what they call Alzheimer's type diseases, people having seizures, I mean, it's just epidemic,
[02:04:50.620 --> 02:04:56.140]  epidemics in childhood cancer, something unknown 50, 60 years ago, let's get your brief take
[02:04:56.140 --> 02:05:02.540]  on that, then live extension, and then a bunch of other phone calls, stay with us.
[02:05:02.540 --> 02:05:07.060]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone, this is our last
[02:05:07.060 --> 02:05:09.420]  chance to not relive history.
[02:05:09.420 --> 02:05:13.780]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[02:05:13.780 --> 02:05:14.780]  at home.
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:19.940]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the
[02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:20.940]  shots.
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:25.820]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:31.540]  For the republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held
[02:05:31.540 --> 02:05:35.940]  bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:05:35.940 --> 02:05:40.260]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches, and the Congress
[02:05:40.260 --> 02:05:42.260]  is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:48.260]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington D.C., we have seen a fall
[02:05:48.260 --> 02:05:49.660]  of the republic.

[02:07:00.460 --> 02:07:05.140]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:09.460]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:07:09.460 --> 02:07:13.780]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:07:13.780 --> 02:07:15.100]  allows you to have.
[02:07:15.100 --> 02:07:20.820]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:07:20.820 --> 02:07:25.140]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:07:25.140 --> 02:07:29.140]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:07:29.140 --> 02:07:32.620]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:07:32.620 --> 02:07:36.340]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[02:07:36.340 --> 02:07:41.060]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:44.860]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[02:07:44.860 --> 02:07:46.260]  one of my old sponsors.
[02:07:46.260 --> 02:07:50.500]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:50.500 --> 02:07:52.100]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:07:52.100 --> 02:07:59.100]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-877-327-0303.
[02:07:59.100 --> 02:08:21.380]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:21.380 --> 02:08:23.180]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:28.260]  You know, we're talking about this finale, one of hundreds of things in our environment
[02:08:28.260 --> 02:08:29.260]  that are hurting us.
[02:08:29.260 --> 02:08:33.060]  The federal government admits, just a little bit of it on your finger, massively lowers
[02:08:33.060 --> 02:08:34.060]  male fertility.
[02:08:34.060 --> 02:08:38.460]  Oh, I'm sure that makes John P. Holdren, who openly says he wants to sterilize us.
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:40.660]  The White House science are very upset.
[02:08:40.660 --> 02:08:42.460]  But here's medical news today.
[02:08:42.460 --> 02:08:49.860]  95% of U.S. paper money tainted with bisphenol A, and it goes on to say that it's, in plastic
[02:08:49.860 --> 02:08:51.780]  bottles, it's locked in.
[02:08:51.780 --> 02:08:55.300]  So it's the microwaving and things that really releases it.
[02:08:55.300 --> 02:08:59.580]  And the money, it's just like the printer ink, it comes right off on you.
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:02.180]  I mean, Dr. Mercola, does it ever end?
[02:09:02.180 --> 02:09:04.180]  Well, it's a challenge.
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:08.300]  I mean, there's certainly some benefits of living in an advanced industrial society,
[02:09:08.300 --> 02:09:09.900]  but it comes at a price.
[02:09:09.900 --> 02:09:16.700]  So you need to be diligent about what those risks are and minimize your exposures.
[02:09:16.700 --> 02:09:22.420]  Now getting back to the question I launched right before the break.
[02:09:22.420 --> 02:09:26.620]  What's your view on that point?
[02:09:26.620 --> 02:09:34.260]  Well, some of the diseases you mentioned, certainly are as a result of exposure to these
[02:09:34.260 --> 02:09:36.300]  toxins and environmental hazards.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:40.980]  You know, the ones that come to mind would be some of the mercury's exposure and the
[02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:46.980]  vaccine and maybe the other contaminants that are vaccine-illuminant.
[02:09:46.980 --> 02:09:53.220]  And then, of course, the dietary, but it doesn't lack of vitamin D. It's massive because,
[02:09:53.220 --> 02:09:57.620]  you know, we're not designed to swallow vitamin D, we're designed to get it from the sun,
[02:09:57.620 --> 02:10:00.500]  but most of us in the winter, that's not really a practical option.
[02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.580]  So it's a combination of factors.
[02:10:02.580 --> 02:10:06.220]  But one of the things I want to mention while remembering is some of the new research that's
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:10.300]  come out that's really pretty intriguing because Alzheimer's, as you mentioned, is an
[02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:15.420]  increasing epidemic to the point where more than one in three people are projected to
[02:10:15.420 --> 02:10:18.860]  eventually have this, it's not pretty to lose your mind, but we're finding that one
[02:10:18.860 --> 02:10:22.820]  of the best things to do is follow a healthy lifestyle, exercise, get your vitamin D levels
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:27.260]  up, avoid the sugar, but also, even if you have Alzheimer's, what's been found recently
[02:10:27.260 --> 02:10:29.780]  to be highly effective is coconut oil.
[02:10:29.780 --> 02:10:34.500]  And about a tablespoon a day has been shown to produce massive improvement in a number
[02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:39.820]  of people and really get their sanity back at their brain function, which is really quite
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:45.180]  extraordinary to consider how simple foods like this can get such a powerful benefit.
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:47.460]  Well, I mean, isn't food really the original medicine?
[02:10:47.460 --> 02:10:50.060]  I mean, it's what we're designed to eat.
[02:10:50.060 --> 02:10:57.140]  Well, but there seems to be some specific benefit to coconut with respect to how biochemically
[02:10:57.140 --> 02:11:00.900]  interacts with the brain and providing sort of bypasses some of the dysfunction that occurs
[02:11:00.900 --> 02:11:03.460]  in the path to general brain disease.
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:05.300]  So it's particularly intriguing.
[02:11:05.300 --> 02:11:07.020]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:11:07.020 --> 02:11:10.660]  One of the good strategies you could also use, and I highly recommend people consider would
[02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:18.020]  be organic vegetable juice, you know, could aid to 16 hours a day of fresh organic vegetables,
[02:11:18.020 --> 02:11:22.620]  not so much the fruits, but the vegetables, the green ones, with a base of celery, cucumbers,
[02:11:22.620 --> 02:11:27.260]  and adding some lime to decrease the bitterness of some of the dark greens like kale and collards,
[02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:33.300]  and really provide a whole path of beneficial biochemicals that will really push your body
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:35.820]  towards health.
[02:11:35.820 --> 02:11:38.860]  We've all got to make the commitment.
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:42.860]  Back over 10 years ago, I was in really good shape and then I just got out of shape and
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:46.740]  it's very hard to get back into shape and start eating properly again, but I'm slowly
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:47.740]  moving there.
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:50.700]  But it's something that freedom lovers all have to do.
[02:11:50.700 --> 02:11:54.780]  I mean, this revolution against tyranny starts with our bodies.
[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:57.100]  Let's take another call from Donna in California.
[02:11:57.100 --> 02:11:58.100]  We got to move quick now.
[02:11:58.100 --> 02:12:00.940]  Donna, you're on the air with Dr. Joseph Merkola.
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:01.940]  Go ahead.
[02:12:01.940 --> 02:12:02.940]  Oh, great.
[02:12:02.940 --> 02:12:03.940]  Hi, Alex.
[02:12:03.940 --> 02:12:04.940]  Hi.
[02:12:04.940 --> 02:12:05.940]  First time caller.
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:06.940]  Hi, Dr. Merkola.
[02:12:06.940 --> 02:12:07.940]  Hi.
[02:12:07.940 --> 02:12:09.940]  I'm from Spring, California, as you said.
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:14.700]  I'm just very excited to be on air and I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:12:14.700 --> 02:12:20.460]  And I'm a first-time subscriber, just started listening to you and I'm spreading the word.
[02:12:20.460 --> 02:12:25.740]  I just wanted to let you know that I'm out calling these companies about the best female
[02:12:25.740 --> 02:12:27.180]  lay and all this other stuff.
[02:12:27.180 --> 02:12:30.460]  So I try to do one or two a day before I go to work.
[02:12:30.460 --> 02:12:31.460]  That's awesome.
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:36.140]  Anyway, I just want to thank you and I appreciate you guys and keep up the good work.
[02:12:36.140 --> 02:12:38.340]  And if there's anything I can do, give me a call.
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.340]  All right.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:40.340]  Well, you're a sweetheart.
[02:12:40.340 --> 02:12:41.340]  Do you have any questions for our...
[02:12:41.340 --> 02:12:42.340]  I thought...
[02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:43.340]  Yeah, actually I do, Alex.
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:44.340]  Thanks.
[02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:49.340]  I was curious about, because you've talked about the best female lay in the plastics and
[02:12:49.340 --> 02:12:53.660]  I'm looking at my cupboards and my storage and I've got all these canned goods and things
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:54.660]  that are in plastic.
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:13:01.540]  Is there a way to know exactly which ones to get rid of and, you know, is there a list
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:04.260]  of plastic companies or whatever we shouldn't be using?
[02:13:04.260 --> 02:13:05.500]  Well, that's another great point.
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:12.140]  The little juice boxes, most of the things like Capri Sun, you name it, they have plastic
[02:13:12.140 --> 02:13:17.500]  lining in them and a lot of them, it's made of bisphenol A, correct, Dr. Mercola?
[02:13:17.500 --> 02:13:18.500]  Yeah.
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:22.780]  The general principle is, as far as I understand, that 90% of the money that Americans spend
[02:13:22.780 --> 02:13:26.940]  on food is for processed foods and when you process the foods, there's a risk because
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:30.420]  you have to package it the way it's going to store it and most of these packaging materials
[02:13:30.420 --> 02:13:31.420]  are fraught with dangers.
[02:13:31.420 --> 02:13:35.740]  So, you know, occasionally, exposure is not going to be a big issue, but on a regular
[02:13:35.740 --> 02:13:39.980]  basis you really want to move away from that and find foods that are packaged in glass.
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:41.620]  That's a key thing.
[02:13:41.620 --> 02:13:45.580]  Another element that is commonly overlooked is that these vegetables and fruits, once
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:52.260]  you package them and process them, normally they have methanol, but it's combined with
[02:13:52.260 --> 02:13:56.700]  pectin and a fruit or vegetable and if you eat it raw or fresh, not a problem, but once
[02:13:56.700 --> 02:14:01.580]  you package it, this methanol gradually dissociates, methanol is another term for wood alcohol
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:04.500]  and it can cause significant neurological complications.
[02:14:04.500 --> 02:14:08.180]  So, really, the general take home message is stay away from processed foods as much
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:10.780]  as possible and make your food fresh.
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:14.220]  You know, I didn't know that until a few months ago, but I correct me if I'm wrong.
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:20.060]  What you're saying is that when you take canned peaches or whatever the case may be, the
[02:14:20.060 --> 02:14:25.060]  natural things in it starts breaking down into something toxic.
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:26.820]  Well, it's liberated.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:31.420]  Normally, it's connected in a way that doesn't cause a problem in your body because it doesn't
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:35.980]  have an enzyme to dissociate it, but it breaks down spontaneously once it's processed over
[02:14:35.980 --> 02:14:36.980]  time.
[02:14:36.980 --> 02:14:40.100]  So, longer it is, the worse the problem is that you can have significant complications
[02:14:40.100 --> 02:14:41.100]  effect.
[02:14:41.100 --> 02:14:46.020]  Many researchers believe it's a primary factor for the cause of multiple sclerosis and other
[02:14:46.020 --> 02:14:48.300]  autoimmune diseases.
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:49.300]  Amazing.
[02:14:49.300 --> 02:14:50.300]  Donna, God bless.
[02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:55.300]  Let's talk to Larry in California, Larry, you're on the air.
[02:14:55.300 --> 02:14:56.300]  Hello, Larry.
[02:14:56.300 --> 02:14:57.300]  Hello, Alex.
[02:14:57.300 --> 02:14:58.300]  Hey.
[02:14:58.300 --> 02:14:59.300]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:59.300 --> 02:15:08.100]  I'm an ex-convict there and I'm telling you, man, quit badmouthing us ex-convicts here in
[02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:09.100]  California.
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:10.100]  All right, Larry.
[02:15:10.100 --> 02:15:12.100]  I appreciate your call.
[02:15:12.100 --> 02:15:13.100]  I know that's a prank call.
[02:15:13.100 --> 02:15:17.820]  I don't really talk too much about ex-convicts, but good to hear from you, Larry.
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:21.260]  Let's talk to Chris in Maryland that we don't screen our calls, folks.
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:23.540]  Chris in Maryland, you're on the air with Dr. Merkola.
[02:15:23.540 --> 02:15:24.540]  Hey, guys.
[02:15:24.540 --> 02:15:26.140]  I'm finally glad to finally get on.
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:32.540]  It's hard to get on here, but my question for your guest is that I was seriously operated
[02:15:32.540 --> 02:15:36.460]  on by the military and I have a feeling that I might be a goner.
[02:15:36.460 --> 02:15:41.460]  But if martial law is called, I told my wife and kids that we will bug out of here to get
[02:15:41.460 --> 02:15:43.580]  away from the populated areas.
[02:15:43.580 --> 02:15:48.500]  Since they took out my terminal ilium and I have B12 deficiency, is there some way that
[02:15:48.500 --> 02:15:53.060]  I can bypass that to get the B12 because I have a feeling if I don't get it, I'll be
[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:54.060]  a dead man?
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:58.860]  Well, eventually you'll die, but before that, you'll become blind and develop other neurological
[02:15:58.860 --> 02:15:59.860]  complications.
[02:15:59.860 --> 02:16:00.860]  But you're right.
[02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:04.700]  The B12 is a very large vitamin, the largest one we know, and it's required to combine
[02:16:04.700 --> 02:16:09.100]  with intrinsic bacteria observed in the terminal ilium, which has been surgically respected
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.100]  in your case.
[02:16:10.100 --> 02:16:16.340]  So the bypass of that is to take an injectable form of vitamin B12 once a week or so, or
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:19.620]  on our site, we actually have a spray, which you just spray under your tongue that absorbs
[02:16:19.620 --> 02:16:23.580]  self-lingually, and you didn't bypass it the expense and inconvenience of having to do it
[02:16:23.580 --> 02:16:24.820]  at a shot every week.
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:26.500]  But you can't swallow it.
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:29.820]  It won't be absorbed, so that's the key.
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:32.380]  But will it still get into my body without an injection?
[02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:33.380]  I mean, can I use that?
[02:16:33.380 --> 02:16:38.820]  If you spray it sublingually, it will, because underneath your tongue, you know, but you
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:42.580]  know, it goes into your saliva glands, correct?
[02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:43.580]  Yeah.
[02:16:43.580 --> 02:16:46.900]  Well, there's a capillary underneath your tongue that just is a direct absorption into
[02:16:46.900 --> 02:16:47.900]  the bloodstream.
[02:16:47.900 --> 02:16:50.300]  So you don't have to absorb it through your...
[02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:52.300]  Yeah, that's why folks chew tobacco.
[02:16:52.300 --> 02:16:54.300]  It's a great way to get the drug in.
[02:16:54.300 --> 02:16:55.300]  Yeah.
[02:16:55.300 --> 02:16:58.580]  The way that you can put out the information, Alex, where I can get some of this or some
[02:16:58.580 --> 02:16:59.980]  of us who have this problem.
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:00.980]  Absolutely.
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:06.140]  I just said, Merkola website.com has it.
[02:17:06.140 --> 02:17:10.740]  And there's a lot of other products out there, so I appreciate your call.
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:13.580]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Gabriel Enmash.
[02:17:13.580 --> 02:17:15.660]  Gabriel, you're on the air.
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:16.660]  Hello?
[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:17.660]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:17.660 --> 02:17:18.660]  Hey, Alex.
[02:17:18.660 --> 02:17:24.140]  I want to talk about GMO, soy and corn.
[02:17:24.140 --> 02:17:30.700]  About 90% of everything we buy in the stores is got, you have to forgive me, I'm really
[02:17:30.700 --> 02:17:31.700]  nervous, okay?
[02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:32.700]  We're almost out of time though.
[02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:33.700]  Go ahead.
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:39.980]  But everything in the stores you buy has got genetically modified soy or corn derivatives
[02:17:39.980 --> 02:17:46.620]  or resistant, it's got pesticide resistant bacteria in it, and it stays in our gut.
[02:17:46.620 --> 02:17:47.620]  Yes.
[02:17:47.620 --> 02:17:53.620]  And the animals that eat it, we eat these animals and yeah.
[02:17:53.620 --> 02:17:56.260]  Yeah, we're in deep trouble.
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:58.700]  I appreciate your call.
[02:17:58.700 --> 02:18:00.220]  It is incredible.
[02:18:00.220 --> 02:18:04.220]  In closing, Dr. Merkola, comment on what he was saying and then talk more about that
[02:18:04.220 --> 02:18:06.900]  life extension dealing with the DNA strands.
[02:18:06.900 --> 02:18:12.620]  Well, GMO is an issue, it's in over 90% of the corn and soy, so you really want to avoid
[02:18:12.620 --> 02:18:17.780]  those foods and really, you can go to our site, we got a, just type that in, and Jeffrey
[02:18:17.780 --> 02:18:22.980]  Smith has put together a GMO free shopping guide so that you can vote with your pocketbook
[02:18:22.980 --> 02:18:27.260]  and not purchase these products, and that's going to be the most powerful action you can
[02:18:27.260 --> 02:18:30.700]  take as a consumer to get this stuff off the market.
[02:18:30.700 --> 02:18:31.700]  Just don't buy it.
[02:18:31.700 --> 02:18:32.700]  It's easy to avoid.
[02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:39.500]  With respect to the calendar lengthening, the life tends to end at about 120, it's
[02:18:39.500 --> 02:18:43.220]  very, very rare to find anyone older than that, that's because it's a basal degradation
[02:18:43.220 --> 02:18:46.780]  of these calendars, these end caps on the DNA, on the chromosomes.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:51.540]  And once you get down to about 5,000 or so, you die, it's probably the most accurate
[02:18:51.540 --> 02:18:53.500]  biological clock that we have.
[02:18:53.500 --> 02:18:57.540]  So there are things that can accelerate it, which is unhealthy lifestyle, it's just smoking
[02:18:57.540 --> 02:19:02.620]  and sugar and lack of exercise and trans fat and free radical exposures, so that will
[02:19:02.620 --> 02:19:04.140]  cause you to die much earlier than 120.
[02:19:04.140 --> 02:19:07.660]  So you want to be as healthy as you can, but even if you were the healthiest, perfectly
[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:11.660]  possible lifestyle, you're still going to die at 120, so the exciting research is that
[02:19:11.660 --> 02:19:15.860]  they've identified this enzyme that actually can be turned on, because it's not in your
[02:19:15.860 --> 02:19:19.260]  reproductive cells, but it's not in an all-our-body or somatic cell.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:23.340]  So there's going to be these enzyme inhibitors that you'll be able to take, it will turn
[02:19:23.340 --> 02:19:28.500]  on this polymerase gene, and you'll actually be able to add calendars, and in research,
[02:19:28.500 --> 02:19:33.980]  in the animals and test tubes, it actually reverses aging, so it's very exciting, and
[02:19:33.980 --> 02:19:38.100]  the take home message is to stay as healthy as you can, because if you can do that, and
[02:19:38.100 --> 02:19:41.340]  you're around at 20 or 30 years, and you're still pretty healthy, you can probably have
[02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:43.620]  another 50 years without even blinking.
[02:19:43.620 --> 02:19:45.260]  Unbelievable, you know what?
[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:49.820]  I don't want to twist your arm, but do five more minutes with us on other life extension
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:55.340]  developments, and they also have the diets they put rats on, as you know, that double
[02:19:55.340 --> 02:19:57.220]  their life expectancy.
[02:19:57.220 --> 02:20:01.780]  Let's talk about those diets when we come back.
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:05.220]  Forget everything you've been told about long-term food storage.
[02:20:05.220 --> 02:20:09.700]  When all hell breaks loose, you'll need the single most effective way to get high-powered
[02:20:09.700 --> 02:20:13.180]  Delta Force nutrients to your family fast.
[02:20:13.180 --> 02:20:16.300]  Like any special forces commando, you need a plan.
[02:20:16.300 --> 02:20:18.820]  You need a black-hawked-down food plan.
[02:20:18.820 --> 02:20:22.140]  Introducing the Survival Sprout Bank from Solutions from Science.
[02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:24.100]  Eat your countertop survival garden.
[02:20:24.100 --> 02:20:29.060]  Yes, grow fresh greens right on your countertop in just a few short days.
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:33.420]  Sprouts are the green shoots that emerge from newly germinated seeds, and they are powerhouses
[02:20:33.420 --> 02:20:35.820]  of living, easily absorbed nutrients.
[02:20:35.820 --> 02:20:40.060]  The Survival Sprout Bank is a complete kit with nothing else to buy, and with sprouts
[02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:43.780]  so easy to grow, even children can grow emergency food.
[02:20:43.780 --> 02:20:49.700]  Call 877-327-0365 or go to survivalsproutbank.com.
[02:20:49.700 --> 02:20:56.900]  That's 877-327-0365 or order online at survivalsproutbank.com.
[02:20:56.900 --> 02:21:00.940]  Survival Sprout Bank, your black-hawked-down emergency food plan.
[02:21:00.940 --> 02:21:05.860]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:21:05.860 --> 02:21:06.860]  What have we got?
[02:21:06.860 --> 02:21:09.220]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:21:09.220 --> 02:21:13.140]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:17.340]  Not democracy, not mob rule, two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:21:17.340 --> 02:21:22.020]  So they think they own our land, they think they own our water, children, our education,
[02:21:22.020 --> 02:21:23.020]  our money.
[02:21:23.020 --> 02:21:27.100]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:21:27.100 --> 02:21:30.580]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:21:30.580 --> 02:21:31.580]  You have been warned.
[02:21:31.580 --> 02:21:32.900]  We have the facts.
[02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:34.060]  We have the constitution.
[02:21:34.060 --> 02:21:35.060]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:21:35.060 --> 02:21:36.060]  We have common law.
[02:21:36.060 --> 02:21:40.100]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen, and I'm so excited to be able to offer you
[02:21:40.100 --> 02:21:44.620]  Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping
[02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:47.060]  giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:21:47.060 --> 02:21:53.420]  A new tool in the Info War, Don't Tread on Me, order it at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com
[02:21:53.420 --> 02:22:00.940]  or call toll-free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:22:00.940 --> 02:22:03.700]  Going solar for cheap is as easy as one, two, three.
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:07.340]  If you want to go solar but thought the setup costs were too high, now you can build your
[02:22:07.340 --> 02:22:09.980]  own solar panels for less than $200.
[02:22:09.980 --> 02:22:10.980]  Don't laugh.
[02:22:10.980 --> 02:22:13.660]  We've sold over 45,000 solar do-it-yourself kits.

[02:22:30.180 --> 02:22:31.620]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.620 --> 02:22:35.020]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, and investment advisors won't talk about
[02:22:35.020 --> 02:22:36.020]  gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.020 --> 02:22:40.420]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:22:40.420 --> 02:22:42.060]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.060 --> 02:22:45.580]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.580 --> 02:22:50.540]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:50.540 --> 02:22:56.460]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:56.460 --> 02:23:00.940]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:23:00.940 --> 02:23:04.420]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:08.140]  You can drink ionized water, cleanse your intestines, eat a perfect diet, and even take
[02:23:08.140 --> 02:23:12.260]  lots of quality supplements, and in many instances, only make minimal progress.
[02:23:12.260 --> 02:23:16.780]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals, and drugs?
[02:23:16.780 --> 02:23:18.660]  It is glutathione.
[02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:22.260]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:26.300]  It stops free radicals, keeps sales young, and reduces inflammation.
[02:23:26.300 --> 02:23:31.060]  One World Way protein powder may be able to raise your glutathione production by 64 percent
[02:23:31.060 --> 02:23:32.060]  or more.
[02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:36.380]  One World Way is more effective than any other whey protein powder on the market, because
[02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:39.340]  it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[02:23:39.340 --> 02:23:44.300]  All other, quote, cold-processed whey protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15
[02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:45.780]  percent or more.
[02:23:45.780 --> 02:23:48.260]  One World Way comes in three delicious flavors.
[02:23:48.260 --> 02:23:56.260]  Call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325, or visit 1worldway.com.
[02:23:56.260 --> 02:24:14.540]  In my film Endgame, a blueprint for global enslavement.
[02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:22.220]  I show you world leaders, top scientists, futurists, Ray Kurzweil, Bill Joy, all talking about
[02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:27.980]  how there's six and a half billion people, how they cannot give us the life extension,
[02:24:27.980 --> 02:24:33.820]  and that's why a world government has to be formed to basically reduce our population
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:38.700]  so the elite can inherit the earth and get the life extension.
[02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:43.140]  And again, I just read the mainstream medical literature where they're increasing the life
[02:24:43.140 --> 02:24:49.020]  of certain types of insects three, four times, where they're doubling the life expectancy
[02:24:49.020 --> 02:24:53.020]  of rodents just with diet.
[02:24:53.020 --> 02:24:55.700]  And this literature has been out for a long time.
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:24:59.180]  A lot of the diets are basically high nutrient, but near starvation.
[02:24:59.180 --> 02:25:05.380]  Dr. Merkola, can you comment on not just the lengthening of the DNA strands, but some of
[02:25:05.380 --> 02:25:07.140]  the other studies that are out there?
[02:25:07.140 --> 02:25:09.900]  Well, the most common approach is calorie restriction.
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:16.340]  I'm not a big fan of that, because it's really very difficult to do, and it's logistically
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:17.340]  impractical.
[02:25:17.340 --> 02:25:24.020]  But most of the studies use that as an approach, and my approach is really to optimize insulin.
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:30.100]  So it's very clear from my review of the literature that that's probably the single most important
[02:25:30.100 --> 02:25:36.580]  way to optimize aging is to lower your insulin levels as low as possible, and there's two
[02:25:36.580 --> 02:25:38.420]  primary ways to do that.
[02:25:38.420 --> 02:25:41.460]  One is through limiting your sugars.
[02:25:41.460 --> 02:25:42.460]  Avoid sugar like the plague.
[02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:47.060]  It's really not good for you in any way, shape, or form, so you really want to limit that,
[02:25:47.060 --> 02:25:53.220]  and you want to get your ideal body weight or body fat percentage.
[02:25:53.220 --> 02:25:57.460]  The other important element is to exercise, and there's a lot of confusion about exercise.
[02:25:57.460 --> 02:26:02.860]  I started exercising in 1968, I was a long distance runner for over 40 years, and unfortunately
[02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:06.740]  that is not the best type, so your typical cardio, which you see 90% of people doing
[02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:12.860]  when you go to fitness clubs, and a treadmill or the elliptical or the bike is not the way
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:13.860]  to do it.
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:19.580]  The need is actually much easier, and much more time efficient, is the high intensity
[02:26:19.580 --> 02:26:24.340]  exercise, where you're really getting your heart rate up to maximum over a 30 second
[02:26:24.340 --> 02:26:29.060]  period than going into a recovery period and doing that in a multiple time.
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:31.580]  So it's almost like a power lifting explosive?
[02:26:31.580 --> 02:26:36.980]  Yeah, absolutely, and we have a term for it called PK8, this P-E-A-K8, if you go on my
[02:26:36.980 --> 02:26:41.900]  website and type it in, I've got videos and really, there's no cost to it, I mean for
[02:26:41.900 --> 02:26:44.900]  the information and it just tells you how to do it, really specifically measure heart
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:48.540]  rate, and literally in 20 minutes you get the benefit of working out for two or three
[02:26:48.540 --> 02:26:52.220]  hours, that you would have typical cardio, and that's going to increase your growth
[02:26:52.220 --> 02:26:55.980]  hormone, which tends to go down pretty dramatically after the age of 40.
[02:26:55.980 --> 02:27:02.740]  Well I kind of got into weightlifting from about 17 to 22, multi hours a day, and then
[02:27:02.740 --> 02:27:06.100]  I was talking to some guys that were in really great shape, that were UT football players,
[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:10.380]  and they said, look you need to do some cardio instead, but they said power lift, and I never
[02:27:10.380 --> 02:27:16.340]  got super strong, I could squat 600 and bench press 330, but I weighed 180 pounds, but I
[02:27:16.340 --> 02:27:20.700]  started doing power clings and things, and I'd go home to see my parents from college
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:26.860]  and they'd say, are you on steroids, and I was naturally literally just ripped and bulging
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:28.740]  with muscles, and it was the power lifting.
[02:27:28.740 --> 02:27:32.740]  Yeah, that's more of a high intensity thing, that's actually more of an ideal type of exercise,
[02:27:32.740 --> 02:27:36.580]  and strength training is absolutely an essential component of a good exercise program, it should
[02:27:36.580 --> 02:27:41.020]  be a 50% strength training, 50% of the high intensity, and some good stretching in there,
[02:27:41.020 --> 02:27:45.820]  but you do that, and not only will you help optimize your ability to live a long and healthy
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:50.660]  life, but the quality of life will be good, you won't be crippled in the ability, because
[02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:55.540]  80% of Americans have problems with their joints and arthritis, pain, there's no reason
[02:27:55.540 --> 02:27:59.820]  for that, you don't have to suffer with that type of pain, it's needless if you follow
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:01.340]  healthy lifestyle.
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:08.260]  Amazing, well Dr. Merkola, we had you on many years ago, and it seems like a decade passes,
[02:28:08.260 --> 02:28:12.380]  and I know you've been a busy guy, but it's great to have you back with us, and there's
[02:28:12.380 --> 02:28:22.780]  so much at Merkola, website, merkola.com, M-E-R-C-O-L-A, obviously your last name, Dr. Joseph Merkola,
[02:28:22.780 --> 02:28:27.660]  I look forward to having you back up as things develop with quick pop-ins, and thank you
[02:28:27.660 --> 02:28:29.060]  so much for spending time with us.
[02:28:29.060 --> 02:28:39.900]  You bet, God bless you, what an amazing interview, what incredible information, again we are
[02:28:39.900 --> 02:28:44.900]  starting to really win some battles, but we need to win the war here against the globalist,

[02:33:13.660 --> 02:33:23.820]  coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:34.460]  We are back live, thank you for joining us, it is Wednesday the 8th day of December 2010,
[02:33:34.460 --> 02:33:41.540]  now I said that coming up in this hour I would get into the situation with Jesse Ventura's
[02:33:41.540 --> 02:33:48.580]  TV show, now that some of it has come out in the news I can talk about it without violating
[02:33:48.580 --> 02:33:53.220]  the confidence that I've been brought into with people, of course I can't tell you the
[02:33:53.220 --> 02:33:57.300]  full story but I can tell you part of it, I talked to the governor this morning he is
[02:33:57.300 --> 02:34:02.300]  going to be coming on next week probably Tuesday or Wednesday, he's not doing any other media
[02:34:02.300 --> 02:34:08.140]  but he's going to talk about a host of issues here next week, so let me go ahead and cover
[02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:13.180]  that briefly then I'll get into WikiLeaks and the economy and some other important issues
[02:34:13.180 --> 02:34:21.260]  with the TSA, a huge new development on that front but before I go any further they've
[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:28.260]  had a lot of dirty tricks run against the producers of the last year's A-part series
[02:34:28.260 --> 02:34:35.820]  but especially this year and they've, again they don't want me to get into a lot of it
[02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:41.500]  because they're trying to gauge it and figure out what they're going to do but the police
[02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:46.500]  state episode they would have normally aired it five or six more times in the last three
[02:34:46.500 --> 02:34:52.540]  weeks since it aired November 12th but it hasn't aired, all the other episodes have
[02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:57.820]  aired over and over again in marathons because it's one of the most popular shows on true
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:35:07.100]  TV, now the episodes cost over $200,000 apiece to produce and again they've shelved the
[02:35:07.100 --> 02:35:15.100]  police state FEMA camp special which is very well documented with the threat fusion centers,
[02:35:15.100 --> 02:35:21.540]  the Rex 84, the admission that the government is preparing for civil unrest, I mean that's
[02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:26.980]  all over the news now that they want to use the military for civil unrest and the bill
[02:35:26.980 --> 02:35:34.140]  was introduced and co-sponsored by Representative Steve Cohen and others that Ventura went
[02:35:34.140 --> 02:35:39.540]  and interviewed and Cohen makes a fool out of himself at the end of the show and says
[02:35:39.540 --> 02:35:43.460]  oh you believe in little green men and machines from Mars and Ventura says well here's the
[02:35:43.460 --> 02:35:50.140]  bill and he goes oh I remember that now, it's for emergencies but Ventura goes well it
[02:35:50.140 --> 02:35:54.900]  says for whatever reasons Homeland Security deems fit and in the context of that hour
[02:35:54.900 --> 02:35:59.220]  long show this was groundbreaking, I mean it really shows you how they're rolling the
[02:35:59.220 --> 02:36:06.860]  camps out and Cohen sent letters to Time Warner, he sent letters to the subdivision
[02:36:06.860 --> 02:36:20.460]  true TV, he sicked the ADL behind the scenes three weeks ago on them with, well I'm just
[02:36:20.460 --> 02:36:26.860]  gonna leave it at that, there was other pressure from government quarters but I'm not at liberty
[02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:32.460]  to get into all of that, I can talk about the congressman now, you know some fools
[02:36:32.460 --> 02:36:37.620]  on the internet are like oh they probably pulled this show to hype it, oh yeah that's
[02:36:37.620 --> 02:36:41.300]  exactly what they want to do, they pay for a show, it gets top ratings and they never
[02:36:41.300 --> 02:36:47.500]  air it again, no that's not what's going on and so now there needs to be public pressure
[02:36:47.500 --> 02:36:51.940]  on this for two, three weeks people have noticed that it's not airing, if you go look at the
[02:36:51.940 --> 02:36:56.620]  code on the conspiracy theory website on true TV you can still see where the episode is
[02:36:56.620 --> 02:37:00.300]  there with the text and the video clips it's just hidden, somebody's being a little bit
[02:37:00.300 --> 02:37:08.700]  sloppy over there but now because Cohen yesterday on December 7th put out a op-ed piece in the
[02:37:08.700 --> 02:37:18.500]  Hill newspaper a roll call, the official paper that serves congress in capitol hill and he
[02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:24.580]  calls Ventura a liar in here but doesn't give any evidence and I can tell you he's scared
[02:37:24.580 --> 02:37:29.580]  because he looked like a deer in the headlights and looked foolish in that piece by saying
[02:37:29.580 --> 02:37:34.540]  oh they're happy children and all of this and then saying well that's not a FEMA camp
[02:37:34.540 --> 02:37:39.180]  that's a place for immigrants, well we say that in the piece and show the Rex 84 that
[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:43.780]  they admit and the Houston Chronicle that these FEMA camp contracts are for illegals
[02:37:43.780 --> 02:37:50.500]  but also for citizens and then we show the bill and we show these designated sectors
[02:37:50.500 --> 02:37:56.060]  to expand the camps, I mean it's spot on, it's hardcore and he doesn't get any specifics
[02:37:56.060 --> 02:38:00.860]  in this article, he just says how dangerous it is to have this type of media, he's a big
[02:38:00.860 --> 02:38:05.420]  ADL, Southern Parry Law Center type guy, always out there pushing hate laws and things to
[02:38:05.420 --> 02:38:11.660]  restrict free speech and you see this big push by the FCC commissioner, the commissar
[02:38:11.660 --> 02:38:17.140]  to restrict free speech and openly announcing it and you see Lieberman bragging that he
[02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:24.260]  called Amazon.com and told them to shut down WikiLeaks' link on their site where they
[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:28.740]  were selling some products, I mean it's just incredible, I guess they had their servers
[02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:37.220]  with Amazon.com, so really scary that this is going on and Representative Steve Cohen
[02:38:37.220 --> 02:38:41.980]  calling Ventura a liar in here really makes me angry because I did a lot of the research
[02:38:41.980 --> 02:38:49.540]  for the piece, it's spot on and it's incredible that he would try to deny the bill existed
[02:38:49.540 --> 02:38:54.100]  and laugh at Ventura and say oh space aliens and then Ventura gives him the bill and he
[02:38:54.100 --> 02:39:04.100]  goes oh I do remember that now, oh I mean it's the biggest Perry Mason moment, if this
[02:39:04.100 --> 02:39:10.980]  guy looks like Sylvester caught with Tweety Bird in his mouth with feathers sticking out
[02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:16.140]  is the only way to describe it and the other congressman hides and then the aide comes
[02:39:16.140 --> 02:39:23.180]  out and says yeah we do have concerns about it, I mean I just put a video on prisonplanet.tv
[02:39:23.180 --> 02:39:28.100]  a month ago so I sent Rob Dew and Jason Douglas to Chicago where they were practicing rounding
[02:39:28.100 --> 02:39:33.780]  up citizens and putting them in the sports stadium with the military and you can't make
[02:39:33.780 --> 02:39:40.860]  this up Polish and Czech Republic troops with US role players and admitting on the news
[02:39:40.860 --> 02:39:46.180]  it's for America, you can't make up the telescreens going in Wal-Mart and the government's ticking
[02:39:46.180 --> 02:39:51.460]  their hands down your pants, you can't make up all the urban warfare drills, you can't
[02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:57.260]  make up the brigade homeland and in Tennessee where this guy's based it's in police state
[02:39:57.260 --> 02:40:01.980]  four rise of FEMA, well that film is so important, we have the state rep on, the governor's
[02:40:01.980 --> 02:40:06.500]  in the news saying we've got Homeland Security military checkpoints searching everybody,
[02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:10.700]  this is illegal stop it and Homeland Security said we don't care and did it, you've got
[02:40:10.700 --> 02:40:15.620]  a huge takeover of our society and nobody can deny it and Ventura powerfully at the
[02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:21.740]  end of that piece says they said it couldn't happen here, well it already has, look it's
[02:40:21.740 --> 02:40:34.140]  real and that episode was powerful, so was the JFK one and Cohen is just amazing, I
[02:40:34.140 --> 02:40:39.860]  mean he behind the scenes puts pressure along with others, it gets pulled and then people
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:46.020]  notice it's happened, no doubt he's got more heat, so he runs around on this crusade now
[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:53.220]  in the article, Cohen we must hold the media accountable, I bet you didn't mind the media
[02:40:53.220 --> 02:40:58.420]  telling us there were WMD's in Iraq or that we got to take the H1N1 shot, I mean it's
[02:40:58.420 --> 02:41:03.060]  just incredible and it's in the commercial appeals and a bunch of other newspapers, representative
[02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:15.460]  Steve Cohen goes to the mat with TV's Ventura over conspiracy theory, Time Warner's response
[02:41:15.460 --> 02:41:19.700]  was we believe most viewers accept conspiracy theory for what it is, a series that expresses
[02:41:19.700 --> 02:41:27.180]  different views on conspiracies, you know and they put that conspiracy name on it so
[02:41:27.180 --> 02:41:32.060]  they can say well we're just looking at conspiracies, look their last episode confirms there's
[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:37.100]  uranium and fluoride being put in the water, I mean you see half the women with their hair
[02:41:37.100 --> 02:41:43.140]  falling out, people getting Alzheimer's at 25, cancer exploding, they estimate by 2020
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:48.300]  half the population is going to have diabetes, this isn't funny ladies and gentlemen and
[02:41:48.300 --> 02:41:55.060]  I don't know if Cohen is fully aware of you know what that bill would really do but he
[02:41:55.060 --> 02:42:00.740]  certainly was caught red handed trying to deny it and so he's freaked out, he's angry
[02:42:00.740 --> 02:42:05.380]  and now in America you need to know that if you're not MSNBC and totally paid off by
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:10.500]  bailout money and you're true TV, you know you just get the government coming down on
[02:42:10.500 --> 02:42:15.900]  you so television programs go off the air while we have this backdrop of all these people
[02:42:15.900 --> 02:42:20.500]  in Congress, Jay Rockefeller and the others running around openly saying shut down the
[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:24.300]  alternative media, nobody should be able to criticize the government, I mean he talks
[02:42:24.300 --> 02:42:28.820]  about it here, oh the media shouldn't be you know creating fear of the government, heaven
[02:42:28.820 --> 02:42:35.740]  forbid we act like George Washington, you know the FCC commissar commissioner comes
[02:42:35.740 --> 02:42:41.940]  out and says the freedom we've had in the media is an aberration and the government's
[02:42:41.940 --> 02:42:47.020]  got to decide what can go on air, I mean this is Pravda, this is the Soviet Union if they
[02:42:47.020 --> 02:42:52.500]  have their way, I am proud of that episode, I'm proud of the global warming episode,
[02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:56.260]  I'm proud of the population reduction episode from last season, I'm proud of being in that
[02:42:56.260 --> 02:43:01.580]  water episode, it's all true, they have to fact check every bit of that, they've had
[02:43:01.580 --> 02:43:05.940]  a few episodes about mind control because I mean that's admitted but then they go off
[02:43:05.940 --> 02:43:12.500]  into things they can't prove, you know the network decides hey you're doing a show about
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:17.260]  Plum Island and bio weapons labs all over the country, locals think you know weird animals
[02:43:17.260 --> 02:43:22.700]  are floating up, add that into it, you know I mean there's a few things that are sensationalistic
[02:43:22.700 --> 02:43:26.140]  just because I think some of the people involved in the show are just trying to learn and understand
[02:43:26.140 --> 02:43:31.820]  it, but I'll tell you, you know the water episode, the JFK, the FEMA, the global warming,
[02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:38.620]  the population reduction, the BP special, the oil spill special coming up tomorrow night
[02:43:38.620 --> 02:43:44.700]  or two nights from now, Friday night, the Pentagon strike coming out, that's the last
[02:43:44.700 --> 02:43:52.420]  episode next week, I mean who knows if that'll even make it to air, so here it is and you
[02:43:52.420 --> 02:44:03.860]  really read this
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:07.820]  and he never, doesn't ever really get into the fact that he put pressure on them from
[02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:13.140]  behind the scenes, he goes on to say TBS and Time Warner have a moral and civic responsibility
[02:44:13.140 --> 02:44:19.260]  not to disseminate information they know to be false, they know to be false, he just
[02:44:19.260 --> 02:44:24.820]  makes declaratory statements particularly when it is dressed up to appear as an investigative
[02:44:24.820 --> 02:44:29.780]  reporting, should someone get hurt, oh that's how they, we got to take your free speech,
[02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:35.220]  somebody can be hurt, should someone get hurt as a result of this unsubstantiated programming,
[02:44:35.220 --> 02:44:41.700]  the media will be undeniably held responsible, so see he's trying, I mean this is pure ADL
[02:44:41.700 --> 02:44:47.540]  for it and I would hate to see someone get hurt as a result of callously airing lazy
[02:44:47.540 --> 02:44:53.060]  irresponsible and fear-mongering programming, the media must take personal responsibility
[02:44:53.060 --> 02:44:58.020]  when airing what they purport to be fact and we must take the responsibility to hold them
[02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:03.100]  accountable when they fall dangerously short, you hear those threats, can you imagine what
[02:45:03.100 --> 02:45:13.100]  else went on behind the scenes, so this guy, these people are so dangerous, I mean they
[02:45:13.100 --> 02:45:17.340]  just openly don't want us to talk about all the urban warfare drills, the threat fusion
[02:45:17.340 --> 02:45:21.820]  centers admittedly grabbing all our credit card data in real time committing crimes,
[02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:26.660]  the Mayak Homeland Security reports 95% of it, Janet Napolitano admits this is focused
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:31.820]  on the American people, I mean this is a bait and a switch folks and they're taking this
[02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:36.260]  country over, they're putting telescreens up in the stores saying spy on your neighbors,
[02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:40.500]  they're taking over our society and they want us to go along with it, we have got to say
[02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:48.380]  no and people have got to stand up against people like this congressman and the ADL
[02:45:48.380 --> 02:45:52.300]  and others that are trying to restrict free speech in this country, it's un-American and
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:57.580]  it's dangerous, you know, if Mr. Cohen has got proof something is inaccurate, why doesn't
[02:45:57.580 --> 02:46:01.740]  he talk about it, he just makes these big statements and you know what pal, you're a
[02:46:01.740 --> 02:46:08.020]  public figure, you introduced a bill for the establishment of emergency FEMA camps in
[02:46:08.020 --> 02:46:12.700]  this country and it says for whatever purposes you wish and then we've been to those bases
[02:46:12.700 --> 02:46:22.300]  where they do drills of arresting Americans, so don't give me that baloney, it is so frustrating
[02:46:22.300 --> 02:46:27.180]  to be informed and to know this guy is counting on people not being informed, you know in
[02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:30.900]  the piece they even say oh Cohen probably didn't even read the bill, you know they get
[02:46:30.900 --> 02:46:35.500]  lots of bills from lobbyists, they even try to give the guy a way out, like oh he didn't
[02:46:35.500 --> 02:46:43.260]  know what he was doing, well what does this look like right here, I mean is that not tyranny
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:51.420]  saying oh if something bad happens it's going to be your fault, that's what political correctness
[02:46:51.420 --> 02:46:57.020]  is, that's why they say oh you can't criticize a group, you can't read Bible verses in Canada,
[02:46:57.020 --> 02:47:01.020]  they are rest preachers up there that criticize a group because somebody might hear it and
[02:47:01.020 --> 02:47:05.860]  do something violent, meanwhile the state is gearing up for war against the people and
[02:47:05.860 --> 02:47:12.260]  engage in all sorts of violence against us, let me blitz through other news now.
[02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:18.620]  Hackers strike back to support WikiLeaks founder, WikiLeaks supporters struck back Wednesday
[02:47:18.620 --> 02:47:25.500]  at perceived enemies of the site and it's jailed founder Assange launching hacker attacks
[02:47:25.500 --> 02:47:31.660]  against MasterCard, Swedish prosecutors, a Swedish lawyer and a Swiss group that froze
[02:47:31.660 --> 02:47:37.460]  Assange's bank account, the so called hacktivist operating under the label Operation Payback
[02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:41.380]  claimed responsibility in a Twitter message for causing technical problems at MasterCard
[02:47:41.380 --> 02:47:46.660]  which pulled the plug on the relationship with WikiLeaks on Tuesday, it's a denial of
[02:47:46.660 --> 02:47:52.580]  service attack, it looks like they are experiencing heavy traffic but spokesman James Issa told
[02:47:52.580 --> 02:47:56.100]  the Associated Press the company would not confirm whether WikiLeaks was involved and
[02:47:56.100 --> 02:48:00.020]  it goes on through other things being attacked.
[02:48:00.020 --> 02:48:04.260]  The problem is that they've now introduced bills to basically shut internet freedom in
[02:48:04.260 --> 02:48:10.140]  the name of WikiLeaks, it's the Internet's 9-11 and of course it's an inside job and
[02:48:10.140 --> 02:48:16.300]  Assange has been fed this stuff by high level people, the right hand man of George Soros,
[02:48:16.300 --> 02:48:24.020]  the open society organization, the CFR, former president Leslie Gelb and others, notice
[02:48:24.020 --> 02:48:29.220]  the leaks are continuing and they're saying okay, bye-bye Assange, you're the patsy and
[02:48:29.220 --> 02:48:36.260]  then meanwhile it just all continues, there's no doubt Assange has been set up, I mean over
[02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:41.220]  in Sweden they call it, what's the exact term, I've got it here in the article, they call
[02:48:41.220 --> 02:48:48.540]  it sudden sex or that it's surprise sex, that's the technical term, where oh the woman got
[02:48:48.540 --> 02:48:53.380]  excited but she didn't really mean it so you go to jail and they teach in all the colleges
[02:48:53.380 --> 02:48:58.980]  any sex, with your wife it's rape, men are inherently evil, that's just to divide women
[02:48:58.980 --> 02:49:02.900]  so they can be cornered by the government by themselves, so women don't have families
[02:49:02.900 --> 02:49:06.980]  that are strong, so they can deprive you of true humanity and look at how screwed up society
[02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:12.300]  is, that's the goal, they've got to destroy it to then take it over, Assange could face
[02:49:12.300 --> 02:49:17.300]  espionage trial in the U.S. and now they've got him for having sex with women who agreed
[02:49:17.300 --> 02:49:25.340]  to it, now U.S. government's talking about espionage charges against him, yeah you order
[02:49:25.340 --> 02:49:30.860]  troops to torture children in Iraq, that's okay or banks can steal trillions but you
[02:49:30.860 --> 02:49:34.860]  do this, you're going to get an espionage charge so they can set the precedent that
[02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:40.100]  anybody reports on corruption, you get an espionage charge, see they want this criminal
[02:49:40.100 --> 02:49:45.540]  state secrets kept secret, leaks brought out the atomic soldiers, leaks brought out
[02:49:45.540 --> 02:49:49.260]  Project Shad, the government nerve-gassing our own trips, leaks brought out our government
[02:49:49.260 --> 02:49:54.380]  injecting children and claiming its vaccines with polio and other degenerative diseases
[02:49:54.380 --> 02:49:58.780]  and killing them are like syphilis, see they don't want that coming out, they want you
[02:49:58.780 --> 02:50:05.020]  to, the government loves us and big sisters on big telescreens and jumbo trons telling
[02:50:05.020 --> 02:50:06.580]  us everything.
[02:50:06.580 --> 02:50:13.220]  So continuing, this is very very dangerous ladies and gentlemen and a lot of people are
[02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:19.900]  striking back and saying no and they're calling this the first official info war between the
[02:50:19.900 --> 02:50:25.340]  people and the system, the Daily News calls it hero or terrorist, the Assange effect represents
[02:50:25.340 --> 02:50:31.500]  a real grassroots internet rebellion, no doubt about that and the answer is more leaks on
[02:50:31.500 --> 02:50:38.620]  every front, okay, the government operates in secrecy as a pack of crooks.
[02:50:38.620 --> 02:50:43.100]  Continuing here the government's talking about prosecuting the New York Times and others,
[02:50:43.100 --> 02:50:50.420]  I want to go over some more of the heavy hitters that are involved in all of this, Assange
[02:50:50.420 --> 02:50:55.260]  is also saying and an op-ed he got out before he got arrested that to take down WikiLeaks
[02:50:55.260 --> 02:50:59.420]  you've got to take down the whole internet, I think that may be what the globalist are
[02:50:59.420 --> 02:51:01.580]  thinking about doing.
[02:51:01.580 --> 02:51:05.300]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:10.220]  18 years ago we developed a program that has made thousands debt free in just 90 days,
[02:51:10.220 --> 02:51:15.020]  it's called Zero Debt in 90 Days and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even
[02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:16.420]  collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.420 --> 02:51:21.300]  When I first joined I was being sued, so I used the program methods and after filing
[02:51:21.300 --> 02:51:24.940]  one piece of paper the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.940 --> 02:51:29.260]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days your success is guaranteed in writing, there is no other program
[02:51:29.260 --> 02:51:30.260]  of its kind.
[02:51:30.260 --> 02:51:33.700]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you, let our team of experts provide the
[02:51:33.700 --> 02:51:38.540]  resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days, guaranteed, prevent wage
[02:51:38.540 --> 02:51:42.980]  garnishments, bank levies and stop collection calls with our proven program, call Zero Debt
[02:51:42.980 --> 02:51:49.740]  in 90 Days now 800-477-9256 and ask for free information from an expert who also completed
[02:51:49.740 --> 02:52:00.980]  our program 800-477-9256 or zerodebtguaranteed.com 800-477-9256 or zerodebtguaranteed.com
[02:52:00.980 --> 02:52:06.260]  They helped to create a new world order, we are part of a new world order, a new world
[02:52:06.260 --> 02:52:08.980]  order based upon collective action.
[02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:13.100]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalist through their own words and
[02:52:13.100 --> 02:52:14.100]  documents.
[02:52:14.100 --> 02:52:18.580]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:21.020]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.020 --> 02:52:25.860]  The United Nations would take over America, the Trilateral Commission would control the
[02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:26.860]  world.
[02:52:26.860 --> 02:52:32.020]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:34.540]  to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.540 --> 02:52:39.020]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global
[02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:40.020]  financial system.
[02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:42.900]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:47.220]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else and I got news for
[02:52:47.220 --> 02:52:48.980]  you, you're everyone else.

[02:53:50.700 --> 02:54:20.380]  I was sitting in traffic, listening to the radio, George Trait was singing, seashores
[02:54:20.380 --> 02:54:33.220]  of Mexico, here's the headline, WikiLeaks Spokesman, only way to stop whistleblowers
[02:54:33.220 --> 02:54:38.940]  is to shut down the web, well they've got legislation to make you have IDs when you're
[02:54:38.940 --> 02:54:44.180]  online to charge you with espionage if you basically leak any type of corruption of any
[02:54:44.180 --> 02:54:49.380]  government, I mean it's just criminals trying to protect themselves, it's totally disgusting
[02:54:49.380 --> 02:54:52.300]  they're not trying to protect us, folks they're trying to protect the fact they're running
[02:54:52.300 --> 02:54:56.060]  the terrorist, they've been caught over and over again shipping the drugs and running
[02:54:56.060 --> 02:55:01.860]  the terrorist, I mean you've got to understand that we've got a bunch of psychopathic criminals
[02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:07.660]  running things and nobody is safe until we wake up and face that.
[02:55:07.660 --> 02:55:13.100]  That means you, a cop on a power trip who is still gullible enough to believe that we're
[02:55:13.100 --> 02:55:18.700]  still in Kansas or a school teacher that's gullible or a doctor or a talk show host,
[02:55:18.700 --> 02:55:24.740]  any of you, if you don't know that things are in deep, deep decline and that tyranny
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:33.820]  is growing you are brain dead and there's not time to suck our thumbs and be compliant
[02:55:33.820 --> 02:55:39.060]  cowards anymore, you've noticed I've turned the heat up and gotten more bold, these people
[02:55:39.060 --> 02:55:48.300]  are out of control, now Chinese dissidents that are known CIA connected started WikiLeaks
[02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:54.540]  in 2006 and this was reported on by Cass Sunstein, the White House regulations are openly calls
[02:55:54.540 --> 02:55:59.020]  for infiltrating the internet, running false flags on the web to shut down free speech
[02:55:59.020 --> 02:56:02.820]  and arresting people that criticize the government, that's on record.
[02:56:02.820 --> 02:56:16.300]  Cass Sunstein, Acolyte of George Soros, Minion of George Soros is on record in the 2007 op-ed
[02:56:16.300 --> 02:56:24.020]  PC wrote introducing WikiLeaks to the world, we've got Morton Halpern of the Pentagon Papers
[02:56:24.020 --> 02:56:32.860]  with Daniel Ellsberg, we've got this guy hooked in as the right hand man of Soros literally
[02:56:32.860 --> 02:56:39.460]  running the open society foundation and funding WikiLeaks, boom, CFR by the way, then we've
[02:56:39.460 --> 02:56:47.020]  got Leslie Gelb, former president of the CFR, current president emeritus of it, honorary
[02:56:47.020 --> 02:56:53.820]  president and this guy is hooked in with all the same people and of course WikiLeaks and
[02:56:53.820 --> 02:57:00.060]  of course George Soros, so you add all that together, they needed to burn somebody, they
[02:57:00.060 --> 02:57:08.940]  clearly are involved in cutting Assange loose and they're going to use these leaks that
[02:57:08.940 --> 02:57:17.580]  actually push the globalist agenda on many fronts to now have the other arm, the neoconside
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:21.340]  come in and try to restrict free speech and shut down leaks, that is people reporting
[02:57:21.340 --> 02:57:27.100]  on Hitlerian or Stalinistic corruption going on in the country.
[02:57:27.100 --> 02:57:34.300]  But regardless, Assange has been set up, you've got to get Lee Harvey Oswald 2010, the Patsy
[02:57:34.300 --> 02:57:39.980]  out of jail because they're going to make it all about the spectacle of his trial for
[02:57:39.980 --> 02:57:44.900]  having consensual sex, that's the new thought crime, but they can't keep him long for that
[02:57:44.900 --> 02:57:49.460]  so now they're talking about espionage or financial stuff, they're coming after him
[02:57:49.460 --> 02:57:55.780]  and if they can get him, they can get anybody, you understand that, this is tyranny.
[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:59.580]  Now continuing, I meant to get into this more, but this is big news, we've got to get this
[02:57:59.580 --> 02:58:04.020]  out to everybody, this is a key break in the fight against the TSA and the federal take
[02:58:04.020 --> 02:58:10.940]  over of society, TSA agents complain over body scanner radiation exposure and a cover-up
[02:58:10.940 --> 02:58:16.660]  of the radiation readings and federal studies, that's also in USA Today, get this article
[02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:25.740]  out to everybody you know in this fight, this is so important, it is so important to get
[02:58:25.740 --> 02:58:31.220]  this information out, TSA agents complain over body scanner radiation, it's got all
[02:58:31.220 --> 02:58:36.340]  the intel there, get this to TSA workers you know, go to the airport, hand it out to them
[02:58:36.340 --> 02:59:01.660]  because if they can't get their enforcers to kill themselves, we can get liberty.
