[00:53.500 --> 00:57.460]  three hours and there is so much news absolutely detailing that we are
[00:57.460 --> 01:03.420]  hurtling into a kleptocratic controlled police state whose in-game is the
[01:03.420 --> 01:09.260]  absolute overthrow of the human condition into a technological tyranny and we
[01:09.260 --> 01:15.620]  have massive evidence of depressionary indicators here in the US economy like
[01:15.620 --> 01:23.860]  for the first time since the NFL strike decades ago we're seeing massive
[01:23.860 --> 01:28.340]  unsold tickets at major playoff games across the country and that's happening
[01:28.340 --> 01:34.100]  for several reasons number one the country's in a depression number two
[01:34.100 --> 01:43.460]  people are sick of all the anti-gun pro-Obamacare garbage the NFL wants to
[01:43.460 --> 01:49.060]  arrogantly get rid of Hank Williams Jr. and put Obama in the intro instead you
[01:49.060 --> 01:56.900]  want to have Bob Costas come out and say turn our guns in the NFL will end up
[01:56.900 --> 02:01.460]  going bankrupt and we're also going after its tax-exempt status for the
[02:01.460 --> 02:08.740]  collection of gangsters crooks and con men that own and run the NFL I mean if

[02:28.540 --> 02:34.620]  America and I've been boycotting them for years and I want to watch it collapse
[02:34.620 --> 02:39.820]  into the pile of feces it is I'm sorry to have to talk like that but that is
[02:39.820 --> 02:44.340]  what it is and when it's all done all of you that serve the system all the
[02:44.340 --> 02:48.740]  bureaucrats all the all the paramilitaries all of you when it's all done

[03:14.740 --> 03:18.180]  indicators of what we're dealing with and I'm not happy about the fall of
[03:18.180 --> 03:23.660]  America but I'll tell you I'm not gonna cry watching all the trash and all the
[03:23.660 --> 03:29.020]  sycophants and all the narcissists and all the nobodies I'm not gonna cry

[03:33.020 --> 03:38.020]  many good people have been destroyed by this system by the way the former
[03:38.020 --> 03:44.220]  Polish president who took over after the Soviets fell has said that America no
[03:44.220 --> 03:50.060]  longer leads the world and has now said that Obama and Washington are the new
[03:50.060 --> 03:54.780]  Soviet Union that articles up on info wars.com and they are this isn't

[08:39.140 --> 08:44.660]  next three hours congressman Walter Jones will be joining us to talk about
[08:44.660 --> 08:48.660]  movements to impeach the president what's happening with the ongoing
[08:48.660 --> 08:53.100]  military operations and what's happening with our economy and the expanding
[08:53.100 --> 08:57.380]  debt coming up for 30 minutes at the start of the next hour medical doctor
[08:57.380 --> 09:01.180]  sherry tin penny one of the leading experts on the dangers of the so-called
[09:01.180 --> 09:05.860]  flu vaccine will be joining us to talk about her intel on what the superbugs
[09:05.860 --> 09:10.180]  are that are claiming so many lives around the country that I know personally
[09:10.180 --> 09:17.300]  in my own family has been bacterial but then the media says that it is viral
[09:17.300 --> 09:23.460]  though there are some deadly viruses out there that are attacking the brain so
[09:23.460 --> 09:30.100]  all of that is coming up and more today driving into the office a few hours ago
[09:30.100 --> 09:37.180]  it just really hit me that you hear all these people talk about bowl on lobby
[09:37.180 --> 09:41.900]  come and take it in Greek I guess that's the Greek translated it into the
[09:41.900 --> 09:48.740]  Latin and then of course in Texas when Santa Ana was coming to confiscate the
[09:48.740 --> 09:53.700]  guns they were up on history they said Molon Lombay come and take it and
[09:53.700 --> 10:01.020]  actually fought back in places like Gonzales and San Antonio and other areas
[10:01.020 --> 10:04.740]  when the tyrant Santa Ana tried to confiscate the guns just like when the
[10:04.740 --> 10:11.620]  tyrant King George just 50 something years before had tried to confiscate the
[10:11.620 --> 10:17.340]  firearms in the colonies the colonists had fought back and really our country
[10:17.340 --> 10:21.340]  was born out of an establishment's attempt to disarm there were a lot of
[10:21.340 --> 10:26.420]  other reasons that added to the straws on the camel's back but the the main
[10:26.420 --> 10:31.740]  weight was that if you really study the history so we're at that crossroads yet
[10:31.740 --> 10:35.740]  again and before I get into all of this really important news I want to show you
[10:35.740 --> 10:43.780]  a photo that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com millions of
[10:43.780 --> 10:53.420]  Americans claim that they won't turn their guns in if they're told to but
[10:53.420 --> 10:57.820]  all over the United States and California and areas of New York they've
[10:57.820 --> 11:01.940]  done they've done just that but but here's that headline I mentioned
[11:01.940 --> 11:06.380]  everybody earlier Connecticut gun registration photo for shadows
[11:06.380 --> 11:13.500]  confiscation and it shows hundreds of people again earlier this week lined up
[11:13.500 --> 11:17.260]  to meet the deadline to register their guns which in every case in history
[11:17.260 --> 11:21.580]  they're gonna confiscate it as this is going on with registered guns now in
[11:21.580 --> 11:29.460]  New York State proper so that's that's how this works and I was thinking to
[11:29.460 --> 11:38.500]  myself driving in that you know if push came to shove and a big enough tyranny
[11:38.500 --> 11:46.500]  came in to say turn your guns in I would turn my guns in except for one thing I
[11:46.500 --> 11:52.500]  know what it means once they take the guns then they take your labor they take
[11:52.500 --> 11:57.060]  your children they take your dignity they take your life these things run a
[11:57.060 --> 12:03.660]  course like a viral or bacterial infection like gangrene like flesh-eating
[12:03.660 --> 12:09.060]  bacteria and you notice as we go bankrupt the bureaucrats are only
[12:09.060 --> 12:14.700]  increasing taxes everywhere you notice as we go bankrupt the fines the fees only
[12:14.700 --> 12:23.140]  increase when on every research analysis you look at it will only accelerate
[12:23.140 --> 12:31.380]  our total collapse which homeland security is set up for like a spider we've
[12:31.380 --> 12:40.860]  been bitten by socialism bitten by collectivism bitten by societal rot we
[12:40.860 --> 12:46.300]  have been wrapped up now in the red tape in the bureaucracy in the police state
[12:46.300 --> 12:50.540]  but the spider doesn't eat you right away they they only give you enough of a
[12:50.540 --> 12:57.620]  bite to immobilize you at first to stun you then the spider wraps you up and
[12:57.620 --> 13:06.380]  then gives its venom time to dissolve your tissues and slowly kill you and
[13:06.380 --> 13:11.700]  then right before you die this is how spiders operate with other insects so
[13:11.700 --> 13:19.660]  arachnids operate with insects the spider comes over and sucks the juices
[13:19.660 --> 13:26.100]  out of the body because the spider's venom is its saliva and so we're all
[13:26.100 --> 13:32.220]  being digested we're all being softened up while we're still alive as we go into
[13:32.220 --> 13:37.260]  zombiosis as the IQs drop as the cancer rates explode as the families fall apart
[13:37.260 --> 13:44.700]  as the society degenerates as the curse of tyranny spreads the only people that
[13:44.700 --> 13:50.460]  are quasi-resistant are rural historically anti-establishment type
[13:50.460 --> 13:55.460]  folks but they're all watching dish TV and direct TV and all the rest of it
[13:55.460 --> 14:00.620]  right now so they're all eating their white bread and their GMO they still
[14:00.620 --> 14:04.300]  don't trust the system but they've been knocked out of the battle but still
[14:04.300 --> 14:07.420]  they've got to be targeted as the number one enemy just because their
[14:07.420 --> 14:12.000]  ancestors might have resisted tyranny there's a score to settle that the New
[14:12.000 --> 14:18.340]  World Order has and that's what we're under now as a society and we are
[14:18.340 --> 14:25.260]  wrapped up in the web we are having our tissue our organs dissolved and the
[14:25.260 --> 14:31.660]  spider is there with its mandibles dripping with saliva preparing to suck
[14:31.660 --> 14:40.300]  us dry as an act of total siege and total war totally premeditated and you've
[14:40.300 --> 14:45.940]  got all the sellouts and all the traders captaining their little ships leading
[14:45.940 --> 14:54.140]  the other sheep right down a huge whirlpool and they're too narcissistic
[14:54.140 --> 14:59.140]  and too worldly that work for the system to even care as it all comes down
[14:59.140 --> 15:04.660]  around them because they have the cunning to be predators sub predators but
[15:04.660 --> 15:10.860]  they don't have the knowledge to see the trap was designed for them as well you're
[15:10.860 --> 15:15.860]  going to see America betrayed you're going to see America brought low I told
[15:15.860 --> 15:23.420]  you six years ago from Bilderberg Intel when the head of fiat was at
[15:23.420 --> 15:27.940]  Bilderberg that it leaked from our sources through Jim Tucker that they
[15:27.940 --> 15:34.500]  were going to have Chrysler bought basically by the Italians for pennies on
[15:34.500 --> 15:39.180]  the dollar and the multi-billion dollar bailout two billion of specifically
[15:39.180 --> 15:45.860]  Chrysler went to help begin the building of the factories and we told you that
[15:45.860 --> 15:49.500]  five six years ago and then you saw the talk of it a year ago but they said oh
[15:49.500 --> 15:53.580]  we're not going to do it now that's off the table and now it's official today
[15:53.580 --> 15:59.860]  just like we paid 20 plus billion dollars to ship General Motors to Brazil
[15:59.860 --> 16:08.100]  China and two Eastern European countries and just like no matter what we do we're
[16:08.100 --> 16:12.540]  not going to be allowed to have any jobs we're under military economic attack
[16:12.540 --> 16:16.780]  that's not a term I just threw out there to describe this that's what they call it
[16:16.780 --> 16:22.580]  we are under total warfare attack okay and you understand the enemies all
[16:22.580 --> 16:28.020]  bragging say that Michael Bloomberg Al Gore all these people are captains and
[16:28.020 --> 16:32.220]  generals and know their cold-blooded savage technocratic mission and they
[16:32.220 --> 16:37.900]  brag about it I mean America said we can never fall America said liberty can
[16:37.900 --> 16:43.700]  never be defeated oh yes it could from within by a bunch of PR folks that gave
[16:43.700 --> 16:47.420]  themselves the moral high ground and who lectured us and who trained us in
[16:47.420 --> 16:52.020]  little ways to be compliant with their tyranny almost like it's American
[16:52.020 --> 16:57.180]  hospitality to do what you're told and they've now got us domesticated and
[16:57.180 --> 17:01.740]  afraid and begging them to tell us what to do and they're going to lead us by
[17:01.740 --> 17:07.180]  the hand ladies and gentlemen down into that basement just like serial killers
[17:07.180 --> 17:10.820]  have done a million times before and they're gonna have their way with us
[17:10.820 --> 17:15.060]  because let me tell you something the party hadn't started yet because when
[17:15.060 --> 17:22.420]  that spider plunges its fangs in not to not to stun us but to drink us dry it's
[17:22.420 --> 17:29.260]  gonna take its time and we're gonna feel every bit of it as they take our
[17:29.260 --> 17:34.220]  children as they hunt down Christians as they ban homeschooling as they teach
[17:34.220 --> 17:40.180]  pedophilia in the schools and so I was thinking today you know look at all
[17:40.180 --> 17:44.100]  those folks in Connecticut look like a lot of good people lined up there tell
[17:44.100 --> 17:47.940]  a lot of veterans a lot of military types lined up to register their guns to
[17:47.940 --> 17:53.940]  have them then confiscated and I thought when they actually banned them and say
[17:53.940 --> 17:58.100]  they're coming for them what will I do and I thought about it I said you know
[17:58.100 --> 18:02.300]  turn some in keep some behind and I said no that's just dishonorable I can't
[18:02.300 --> 18:06.020]  talk like this over all the years and then and then back down and I said plus
[18:06.020 --> 18:11.660]  if I give the guns up they only come for everything after that so I made the
[18:11.660 --> 18:15.780]  realization that they've planned their civil war we know that they plan to push
[18:15.780 --> 18:19.620]  us into a corner they know enough of us know that we can't back off we can't
[18:19.620 --> 18:26.020]  run we're cornered so we've got to fight but I realize we better fight in the
[18:26.020 --> 18:31.580]  info war but what made me feel good about whatever has to happen and to
[18:31.580 --> 18:36.660]  realize that I'll never turn my guns in and then I'm committed and then I had
[18:36.660 --> 18:40.380]  that feeling of peace and calm were these two articles I mentioned yesterday
[18:40.380 --> 18:45.620]  Italian court this is AFP overturns pedophile conviction as 11 year old
[18:45.620 --> 18:49.380]  in love and says 60 year old man is allowed to grab the child out of the
[18:49.380 --> 18:54.900]  backyard and have sex with them if the child said they liked it in court or of
[18:54.900 --> 18:59.060]  the social workers said that now that's pedophilia and that's why they are
[18:59.060 --> 19:03.380]  teaching five-year-olds that you can be a boy girl or both and having sexual
[19:03.380 --> 19:08.380]  talks with five-year-olds in California is to sexualize them and to set the
[19:08.380 --> 19:12.260]  precedent because if they can do that and Jocelyn elders remember said we need
[19:12.260 --> 19:16.700]  a school to help the kids masturbate it's all about pedophilia at the core of
[19:16.700 --> 19:21.220]  this is a pedophile network the spider's brain is basically a satanic
[19:21.220 --> 19:25.060]  pedophile got a lot of other evil people working for it in mercenaries and you
[19:25.060 --> 19:29.460]  name it here's another one California laws take effect to teach five-year-olds
[19:29.460 --> 19:36.940]  how to be transgender now you understand folks that they want your guns just like

[19:42.740 --> 19:47.900]  for a simple they want you immobilized in the web and as soon as they're done
[19:47.900 --> 19:51.860]  getting that web on they're gonna come for us we don't have a choice now they're
[19:51.860 --> 19:55.300]  gonna blow stuff up and blame it on us so we don't want to do anything offensive
[19:55.300 --> 19:59.860]  but when they come for the guns you know what to do
[19:59.860 --> 20:04.700]  the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and other toxic
[20:04.700 --> 20:08.540]  members of the fluoride family are devastating the health and cognitive
[20:08.540 --> 20:13.300]  ability of the American people so why are the social engineers adding it to
[20:13.300 --> 20:17.500]  the water simple dumb down the host population that the parasitic
[20:17.500 --> 20:21.540]  technocracy is feeding on we may not have been able to get fluoride out of

[23:59.820 --> 24:27.020]  alright folks Alex Jones here back live what I was getting at here is that you
[24:27.020 --> 24:30.980]  realize that even though you just want to go with your life and you want to adapt
[24:30.980 --> 24:35.700]  to the tyranny and you work as hard as you can to beat it peacefully they're
[24:35.700 --> 24:40.100]  not going to do that and then you realize that they're fundamentally bad
[24:40.100 --> 24:45.740]  people and you go to city council meetings here in Austin and you talk and
[24:45.740 --> 24:50.580]  and look at the city council members and they're a bunch of crooks who know
[24:50.580 --> 24:54.940]  that they're part of a takeover and and then you realize that even down to low
[24:54.940 --> 24:59.780]  level now these people know what they're doing and predominantly they are
[24:59.780 --> 25:04.940]  what you'll call Democrats or liberals now the Republican Party plays along as
[25:04.940 --> 25:07.980]  the opposition and claims they're fighting it and the Tea Party could take
[25:07.980 --> 25:11.700]  the Republican Party over and reverse this that's why the Democrats are
[25:11.700 --> 25:17.260]  desperately invoking racial and religious and other forms of division so
[25:17.260 --> 25:20.900]  that people will have the right to you know teach a five-year-old how to be a
[25:20.900 --> 25:25.180]  transgender but you won't have the right to not have foreign banks destroy the
[25:25.180 --> 25:30.780]  economy and leverage the next generation's future they're not even
[25:30.780 --> 25:36.940]  mortgaging the generations future it's happening now ladies and gentlemen I've
[25:36.940 --> 25:43.060]  got stacks of news here in front of me where Obamacare supporters are going
[25:43.060 --> 25:48.620]  out shock video customers casually step over dead body and store doorway after
[25:48.620 --> 25:52.700]  he shot we're gonna be playing that video from New York Daily News coming up
[25:52.700 --> 25:59.540]  I talked about this some yesterday before this even happened and came out in
[25:59.540 --> 26:03.940]  the news I talked about how people will just sit there while a citizen's been
[26:03.940 --> 26:07.780]  run over or a cop's been run over and bleeds the death over 45 minutes to an
[26:07.780 --> 26:11.220]  hour or someone will be choking in a restaurant and there'll be a hundred
[26:11.220 --> 26:17.260]  people in there and no one do the Heimlich or a woman's being raped in
[26:17.260 --> 26:22.460]  public and no one helps her this is happening all the time now ladies and
[26:22.460 --> 26:27.340]  gentlemen and that's because they've trained us not to care about each other
[26:27.340 --> 26:33.540]  you only care by supporting MSNBC and getting rid of free speech and
[26:33.540 --> 26:38.180]  supporting Obama that's how you show your trendy and cool and support freedom
[26:38.180 --> 26:44.700]  because he got a peace price it's all the packaging not the substance but in
[26:44.700 --> 26:47.900]  meanwhile when real authoritarianism takes over you don't care in fact they
[26:47.900 --> 26:54.540]  had a study out of a university this year in or now it's last year in Canada
[26:54.540 --> 26:59.460]  that showed environmentalists people that identify as serious environmentalists
[26:59.460 --> 27:04.900]  are six times more likely to steal I think it was eight times more likely to
[27:04.900 --> 27:12.900]  lie and we're way more likely to also use government in retribution and that
[27:12.900 --> 27:18.260]  in the right word as a form of retaliation falsely we covered that and
[27:18.260 --> 27:26.060]  even had the professor on that did the study last year early 2013 and when I'm
[27:26.060 --> 27:30.860]  getting at is there's these authoritarian criminals who want the moral
[27:30.860 --> 27:34.580]  high ground and then they'll always tell you they've got to run your life you've
[27:34.580 --> 27:37.940]  got to pay money when they say you've got to talk like they want you've got to
[27:37.940 --> 27:45.300]  control your speech but then they are wide open and free to act and do whatever
[27:45.300 --> 27:53.100]  they want and that's what I'm getting at here is that the bottom is falling out
[27:53.100 --> 27:57.940]  Obamacare rings in New Year with more mayhem still more cancellations than
[27:57.940 --> 28:03.220]  enrollments more hurdles to come professor blames southern white radicals
[28:03.220 --> 28:07.340]  for Obamacare not working now let me explain something we're gonna get to
[28:07.340 --> 28:13.980]  that video as well Obamacare is working it allows the insurance companies to
[28:13.980 --> 28:17.220]  charge whatever they want and make you buy it and that's why they wrote it and
[28:17.220 --> 28:21.300]  so the whole thing about the website not working is the excuse for the giant
[28:21.300 --> 28:28.820]  screw job it's a distraction technique period period in the Nigerian email
[28:28.820 --> 28:32.020]  scams when you give them $5,000 thinking you're gonna get 10 million or
[28:32.020 --> 28:37.460]  whatever they're saying at the time then they say oh sorry the bank held it up
[28:37.460 --> 28:41.260]  with bureaucratic red tape there's been a problem we just need 10,000 then you'll
[28:41.260 --> 28:44.900]  get 20 million and the people who already put 5,000 in they don't want to admit
[28:44.900 --> 28:50.260]  they've been conned they put 10,000 in this is literally the Nigerian scam I've
[28:50.260 --> 28:53.820]  learned how con artists work I've studied it ladies and gentlemen and they're
[28:53.820 --> 29:00.100]  running a classic con on you just like you go to the carnival and it's a rigged
[29:00.100 --> 29:05.940]  game which is you know one out of a thousand you can win and the carnival
[29:05.940 --> 29:11.740]  guys nice at you at first and then you are unable to win the game and then he
[29:11.740 --> 29:16.140]  goes oh come on don't be a wimp in front of your girlfriend you can do it and
[29:16.140 --> 29:20.940]  then he's nice again when you miss again I've given to you half off this time
[29:20.940 --> 29:25.260]  it's the same thing they just are suckering you we're gonna go into the
[29:25.260 --> 29:28.180]  economy we're gonna go into world events we're gonna get into so much
[29:28.180 --> 29:31.660]  incredible news when we come back it makes my head spin the global warming
[29:31.660 --> 29:35.380]  scientists that we're going to the Antarctic to document the that the
[29:35.380 --> 29:40.100]  Antarctic had melted like Al Gore said it would are still trapped last time I
[29:40.100 --> 29:43.460]  checked we're having record cold temperatures in North America and other
[29:43.460 --> 29:47.260]  parts of the world but according to Al Gore that's global warming we'll be right
[29:47.260 --> 29:54.500]  back so pay him money we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and

[33:36.580 --> 33:41.340]  that came after them the Chinese embers same thing with the Europeans the
[33:41.340 --> 33:47.780]  French style was used to control populations but also to control the
[33:47.780 --> 33:52.220]  elite who would end up buying into it as well generally by what was known as a
[33:52.220 --> 33:58.340]  priest class or a technocratic class of manipulators they go by many different
[33:58.340 --> 34:05.140]  names over the thousands of years you know them and I know them in their 1770s
[34:05.140 --> 34:10.460]  manifestation of the Illuminati because the system always launches its false
[34:10.460 --> 34:15.460]  revolution in the midst of a real revolution to try to co-opt it the
[34:15.460 --> 34:22.180]  devil launched Adam Weishaupt in 1776 and undoubtedly Providence and our Lord
[34:22.180 --> 34:26.940]  the Savior helped launch George Washington and our ancestors in 1776 and
[34:26.940 --> 34:31.180]  he warned of the Illuminati at that time and his president and before his death
[34:31.180 --> 34:35.660]  in public letters available at the National Archives online just typed in
[34:35.660 --> 34:41.020]  George Washington the Illuminati they are unbelievable to read and so here we
[34:41.020 --> 34:47.060]  are seeing if you go back thousands of years the Chinese they would tell the
[34:47.060 --> 34:51.100]  Chinese emperors oh it's so stylish never leave this house for your safety
[34:51.100 --> 34:55.540]  it's so stylish to bind your feet so you can't walk and must be carried it's so
[34:55.540 --> 35:00.220]  stylish to have someone else wipe your hind end you're too royal pretty much
[35:00.220 --> 35:05.540]  all royalty and in super empires end up having everything done for them their
[35:05.540 --> 35:08.860]  hind ends wiped everything the Queen of England has her hind end wiped by the
[35:08.860 --> 35:12.300]  groom of the stool I'm not joking I want you to understand how they manipulate
[35:12.300 --> 35:18.380]  these people even the so-called elites into an obsessive compulsive type system
[35:18.380 --> 35:23.220]  where the public and the elite themselves oh you're not allowed to feed
[35:23.220 --> 35:28.260]  yourself you've got to have two foot long fingernails to make you absolutely
[35:28.260 --> 35:33.540]  dependent in a nanny state and the nanny state the anti-male anti-female
[35:33.540 --> 35:40.100]  anti-human anti-trailblazer system that's being pushed and sold is so that
[35:40.100 --> 35:47.820]  the globalists themselves who act like crazed mad savage wild men privately
[35:47.820 --> 35:52.180]  it was Bertrand Russell and others that said publicly we must have the effect
[35:52.180 --> 35:56.900]  of gentlemen and in be very easy speaking to the public to soothe them but
[35:56.900 --> 36:01.780]  behind the scenes we should be like ravenous wolves crazed with wild man
[36:01.780 --> 36:06.660]  power and that's what the globalists are like I am behind the scenes by the way
[36:06.660 --> 36:10.980]  I'm nothing compared to some of these people okay I just love liberty and I
[36:10.980 --> 36:17.020]  am a wild man let me tell you these people are wild human sacrifices you
[36:17.020 --> 36:21.100]  name it they're into all sorts of stuff and that takes a lot of craziness to do
[36:21.100 --> 36:26.340]  that and they do that to hype up their evil the wars the torture the sex
[36:26.340 --> 36:30.460]  slavery all of it and they've got all of you walking around with limp wrists
[36:30.460 --> 36:34.060]  thinking that that's what's going to make you successful while these savage
[36:34.060 --> 36:39.460]  beasts are running things and that's what I'm trying to explain to everybody
[36:39.460 --> 36:45.300]  ladies and gentlemen is that we're dealing with some hardcore killers here
[36:45.300 --> 36:49.740]  and you're going to have to admit it I want to say something to the ATF and to
[36:49.740 --> 36:53.220]  the FBI and all the different bureaucracies before I get back into the
[36:53.220 --> 36:58.020]  news there's no doubt a criminal groups running the country there's no doubt
[36:58.020 --> 37:01.100]  they're bankrupting it by design there's no doubt the government's funding
[37:01.100 --> 37:05.020]  al-qaeda worldwide there's no doubt it's violating every law you can imagine and
[37:05.020 --> 37:09.020]  persecuting good people and persecuting churches and pro-life groups and targeting
[37:09.020 --> 37:13.540]  the press there's no doubt we have a horrible case of political cancer that
[37:13.540 --> 37:18.140]  goes a lot deeper than Barack Obama he's just the surface of the wart it's got a
[37:18.140 --> 37:29.100]  big long tail and we historically know where all of this is going we
[37:29.100 --> 37:38.820]  historically understand that and if you ignore this information you do it at
[37:38.820 --> 37:44.020]  your own peril now I know most of the work of the system know this is
[37:44.020 --> 37:47.540]  tyranny you do it out of fear now you want your pension you're not gonna get
[37:47.540 --> 37:51.580]  any pension when this all goes down when this is all done the globalists are
[37:51.580 --> 37:56.140]  gonna move on to a new country they're gonna live in high security compounds
[37:56.140 --> 37:59.620]  like the green zone and direct their operations from without and you're going
[37:59.620 --> 38:03.460]  to be screwed when the autonomous robots and drones and all that rolls out the
[38:03.460 --> 38:08.220]  next ten years this is all been publicly stated and so the only future we've
[38:08.220 --> 38:14.340]  got even if you're corrupt is fighting against this you don't want this to go
[38:14.340 --> 38:19.820]  into place and you can deny and say oh we're taking the guns for a more
[38:19.820 --> 38:23.580]  civilized society only we deserve the guns you were chosen for your jobs
[38:23.580 --> 38:27.340]  because of psychological tests you were given and because of testing you were
[38:27.340 --> 38:31.220]  given coming up to the federal and corporate ladder but even if you were
[38:31.220 --> 38:34.940]  chosen because you're on a power trip and chosen because you'll follow orders
[38:34.940 --> 38:42.020]  and chosen because they think you're stupid you've got to be smart enough to
[38:42.020 --> 38:52.180]  know that you've been absolutely totally betrayed you've got to know that and
[38:52.180 --> 39:01.020]  that's what I'm trying to get across to you right now is that we're going to see
[39:01.020 --> 39:05.140]  the destruction of our republic look at info wars calm and the articles right
[39:05.140 --> 39:12.060]  now millions of young Americans refusing to enroll in Obamacare we're going to
[39:12.060 --> 39:16.860]  get to that later anti-communist icon America no longer leads the world
[39:16.860 --> 39:24.500]  former Polish president labels Obama a dangerous disappointment feds preparing
[39:24.500 --> 39:31.060]  for violence targeting social security buildings spending 58 million dollars for
[39:31.060 --> 39:37.180]  just two social security offices oh man I tell you I mean they are gearing up for
[39:37.180 --> 39:41.980]  total collapse you're not going to get your unemployment your your your social
[39:41.980 --> 39:45.740]  security any of it when they're dying to cause the meltdown understand that
[39:45.740 --> 39:48.900]  remember we told you this over a decade ago they're all building towards this
[39:48.900 --> 39:52.380]  well the way they'll get away with it is if we don't explain that they did it on
[39:52.380 --> 39:59.580]  purpose thieves are using mystery gadgets to electronically unlock cars and steal
[39:59.580 --> 40:07.660]  what's inside the great Italian auto bailout courtesy of US taxpayers
[40:07.660 --> 40:18.260]  Chrysler moving overseas that's just some of the news up on info wars.com but
[40:18.260 --> 40:25.060]  here's the issue I'm trying to get at with everybody the system is trying to
[40:25.060 --> 40:32.980]  overthrow reality and it's a very nasty form of corruption we've got it's not
[40:32.980 --> 40:36.620]  just like you can work in the system and it's kind of boss hogging everything's
[40:36.620 --> 40:40.540]  gonna be alright it's not going to be alright because at its core are very
[40:40.540 --> 40:45.780]  twisted sick people who want the power to carry out criminal activities against
[40:45.780 --> 40:52.420]  good people because that's what they like to do and that's why we have to do
[40:52.420 --> 40:58.580]  whatever it takes to beat these people and realize as men we should have the
[40:58.580 --> 41:02.300]  attitude that we're basically going to have to physically defend ourselves and
[41:02.300 --> 41:06.460]  it's going to come down to that sooner rather than later and it's not just a
[41:06.460 --> 41:11.140]  bunch of talk about well I'll shoot the UN helmets and Molan lobby and all this
[41:11.140 --> 41:17.860]  folks this is going to become a real deal okay so you better hit the streets
[41:17.860 --> 41:22.380]  right now you better hit city council right now the state house right now DC
[41:22.380 --> 41:27.540]  right now with information warfare to absolutely try to push the enemy back
[41:27.540 --> 41:32.300]  but in case we can't and they set off nukes and blame it on us or whatever the
[41:32.300 --> 41:38.100]  case is shoot up a school a church a shopping mall blame it on us we've got
[41:38.100 --> 41:48.540]  to be ready folks and if you all you talkers all you talkers out there you
[41:48.540 --> 41:55.940]  talk about how you're gonna have this war with a new world order let's see
[41:55.940 --> 42:01.740]  what you can do in the information war right now affecting the future battle
[42:01.740 --> 42:06.300]  space right now because they're getting the Pentagon tested and lined up in all
[42:06.300 --> 42:10.780]  their big white papers and studies to take on the American South the American
[42:10.780 --> 42:16.860]  gun owner the American West and to target white people basically to create a
[42:16.860 --> 42:21.100]  race war in this country and to draw the battle lines in a
[42:21.100 --> 42:26.420]  balkanized system we need to come together around the Bill of Rights and
[42:26.420 --> 42:33.380]  Constitution as the true culture and expose the culture of division and true
[42:33.380 --> 42:40.100]  race baiting that is the establishment divide and conquer program but again I'm
[42:40.100 --> 42:42.380]  gonna tell everybody that works for the system something I know there are good
[42:42.380 --> 42:48.820]  people inside the system I've been amazed by how many people if white
[42:48.820 --> 42:52.540]  frankly on average there's more people awake in the federal government than
[42:52.540 --> 42:55.860]  there are in the average population because they're there seeing the
[42:55.860 --> 42:59.700]  tyranny they're there being surveilled illegally they're there being harassed
[42:59.700 --> 43:03.340]  they're having their phones listen to you one of the NSA is listening to it's
[43:03.340 --> 43:07.820]  mainly federal employees and high-level corporate people to keep you on a short
[43:07.820 --> 43:12.620]  leash and we told you that years ago that's been leaks now we had the former
[43:12.620 --> 43:17.940]  one of the former head guys over a whole program of internal security at the
[43:17.940 --> 43:26.940]  NSA Wayne Madsen who's the biggest NSA whistleblower of all time
[43:30.220 --> 43:37.620]  and he can tell you what they're doing but there comes a point where you can't
[43:37.620 --> 43:46.820]  be intimidated any more by this and just step out of the light speak out go
[43:46.820 --> 43:50.940]  public and that will overwhelm the system and will expose them but you've got to
[43:50.940 --> 43:58.940]  speak out against it now or there's no future there's no hope and that's really
[43:58.940 --> 44:02.820]  what it comes down to let me just read you some of the headlines here
[44:02.820 --> 44:07.980]  feds consider vehicle location tracking in new cars info wars calm from the
[44:07.980 --> 44:12.900]  right hand column of drudge report comm as well proposal may lead to more
[44:12.900 --> 44:19.620]  accidents mileage taxes and tickets for recorded traffic violations yes it
[44:19.620 --> 44:24.420]  admits that it tracks you via GPS and gives you tickets in the mail the black
[44:24.420 --> 44:27.820]  boxes are already on all the new cars made in the last four years and they're
[44:27.820 --> 44:31.740]  going to make them retroactively put them on your car during inspection and it
[44:31.740 --> 44:38.780]  makes 1984 look like a heavenly place and they always say may may may we may
[44:38.780 --> 44:45.820]  move Chrysler to Italy and then they're already done it so there you go there it
[44:45.820 --> 44:49.940]  is out of ABC news as well beds may require cars to talk to each other to
[44:49.940 --> 44:54.820]  avoid crashing and the next oh it shows that only robot cars are safe you can
[44:54.820 --> 45:00.580]  still have your car and drive it for now but you got to pay higher taxes and
[45:00.580 --> 45:03.980]  have extra insurance I mean this is all been actually worried out I remember
[45:03.980 --> 45:08.380]  reading 10 11 years ago they were meeting in Chicago a big globalist confab
[45:08.380 --> 45:12.420]  publicly how to integrate the quote smart world I forget which meeting it
[45:12.420 --> 45:16.580]  was and they were saying all this and I'm like you're gonna have boxes that
[45:16.580 --> 45:20.380]  give you taxes by the mile and track everywhere you go and and then they're
[45:20.380 --> 45:23.300]  gonna say that humans aren't safe and it's got to be robot cars and let robot
[45:23.300 --> 45:27.820]  cars rolled out for all the commerce and now it's already here with Google I
[45:27.820 --> 45:31.500]  mean I listen please listen to me carefully you're like well that's just
[45:31.500 --> 45:35.980]  the future we'll just accept it it's a future grid of enslavement and then
[45:35.980 --> 45:39.700]  once everything's robot controlled we don't know how to drive cars anymore and
[45:39.700 --> 45:42.940]  you're told what day of the week you can have meat that's all beneficially
[45:42.940 --> 45:48.980]  announced you live in a 250 square foot coffin building when that's all in place
[45:48.980 --> 45:52.540]  they're gonna release superplugs they're already testing superplugs right now
[45:52.540 --> 45:55.940]  that aren't as deadly but they're gonna release the real deal and they've
[45:55.940 --> 46:04.980]  already said that once the digital technocracy grid master computer grid the
[46:04.980 --> 46:10.380]  utopia of zeitgeist is in place the globalists are going ahead with the
[46:10.380 --> 46:15.300]  next phase of their operation I can play the planopolis videos they show school
[46:15.300 --> 46:19.300]  kids in England and you watch it think it's a surrealist joke it's not a
[46:19.300 --> 46:24.220]  surrealist joke when they say the 60 year old men can grab your 11 year old son
[46:24.220 --> 46:28.020]  out of the backyard and rape them it's love that's the quote or they're
[46:28.020 --> 46:31.660]  teaching five-year-olds how they're really a boys that they're really little
[46:31.660 --> 46:39.100]  girls or vice versa they have to come out with this they have to go to the
[46:39.100 --> 46:43.420]  next level they have to throw it in your face and then call you an enemy and a
[46:43.420 --> 46:49.300]  hate monger because you don't accept it that your kids belong to the state MSNBC
[46:49.300 --> 46:55.900]  says and if Jocelyn elders wants to say reach down and show the five-year-old
[46:55.900 --> 47:01.340]  help the master plate well that's not perverted that's a loving lady in a
[47:01.340 --> 47:06.500]  general outfit a weird woman in a general outfit talking about your five
[47:06.500 --> 47:15.580]  year-old genitals you understand the magnitude of this a creepy woman in a
[47:15.580 --> 47:19.700]  general outfit openly and oh and they get off on it when they talk about it
[47:19.700 --> 47:23.300]  just like when Obama said he was the head of the UN illegally and was the head
[47:23.300 --> 47:25.940]  of the Security Council and Kissinger and all these world leaders were there
[47:25.940 --> 47:30.460]  shakingly didn't they had tears in their eyes they had broken America they had
[47:30.460 --> 47:35.380]  brought in world government they had committed a huge act of treason
[47:35.980 --> 47:42.020]  violating article one section 9 right in front of everyone they'd planted the
[47:42.020 --> 47:46.020]  flag they defiled these people I don't know why they get off on it it's like
[47:46.020 --> 47:51.860]  Satanist get off on defiling Christian symbols it's it's just fetish their
[47:51.860 --> 47:56.700]  kids are theirs they're gonna do what they want they're taking over they're
[47:56.700 --> 48:00.140]  gonna let the reactors all leak and blow up and have us all bathe in death
[48:00.140 --> 48:05.260]  because it's a nasty thing to do they're gonna put cancer viruses and all your
[48:05.260 --> 48:09.900]  vaccines because it's a nasty thing to do they're going to ship General Motors
[48:09.900 --> 48:21.180]  to China and Chrysler to Italy and Ford to Mexico and they're gonna pay your
[48:21.180 --> 48:25.940]  money to do it and laugh at you while they do it and it's not gonna help the
[48:25.940 --> 48:32.420]  Mexicans they've set that up to hurt them this is what it is to be in the
[48:32.420 --> 48:40.580]  hands of pure evil that wants to hurt you that wants to hurt me their enemies
[48:40.580 --> 48:44.740]  I was thinking last night as I went to bed and I woke up at like 3 a.m. I just
[48:44.740 --> 48:51.020]  thought there's such enemies the only thing I fear is not resisting them and
[48:51.020 --> 48:59.180]  them completely winning and having their wicked ways with us by the way the
[48:59.180 --> 49:04.620]  morons out on that Enviro ship out there to claim it the Antarctica melted who
[49:04.620 --> 49:12.580]  were stuck for 10 days have been gotten off this morning via helicopter some of
[49:12.580 --> 49:18.580]  the other news that's coming up NFL should be alarmed that three of four

[54:20.060 --> 54:32.180]  Mexico. Folks earlier I mentioned George Washington and his letters on the
[54:32.180 --> 54:39.420]  Illuminati warning about them in 1795 and other years there's quite a few of
[54:39.420 --> 54:44.900]  them in the National Archives there's one of them there on screen that's letter
[54:44.900 --> 54:51.360]  194 it looks like written in the fine hand of our first president and the
[54:51.360 --> 54:59.820]  founder of the US Army who the US Army now in manuals literally demonizes
[54:59.820 --> 55:06.100]  remember that last year George Washington other founders would quote not be
[55:06.100 --> 55:10.980]  welcome in today's Army that's right because if you told them that in the
[55:10.980 --> 55:16.780]  year 2013 they would be teaching five-year-olds how to masturbate and
[55:16.780 --> 55:22.020]  wear dresses they would laugh at you and say that you were joking if you told
[55:22.020 --> 55:28.940]  George Washington I wrote a lot of military histories folks from the world
[55:28.940 --> 55:32.180]  I never anything like his life
[55:32.180 --> 55:36.540]  they made a movie really about George Washington people wouldn't believe it
[55:36.540 --> 55:41.300]  it's so amazing but instead imagine George Washington if he saw this article
[55:41.300 --> 55:45.460]  out of New York Daily News customers walk over dead body after Michigan man
[55:45.460 --> 55:49.460]  killed in store doorway this happened last year but they just released it in
[55:49.460 --> 55:53.740]  the trial the woman who's just been convicted shoots him in the back he
[55:53.740 --> 56:02.780]  falls down in front everybody we can roll that video he falls down and they
[56:02.780 --> 56:09.060]  all just walk over his body and the store clerk continues to help and work
[56:09.060 --> 56:15.580]  with the customers and check people out after he's been shot in the back and
[56:15.580 --> 56:20.380]  dies and that's what I'm talking about and I put out that video a few days ago
[56:20.380 --> 56:24.340]  where John bounds on the woman's car on fire she's standing two feet from it and
[56:24.340 --> 56:27.900]  about 20% people say yeah you shouldn't have told her get away from the car it's
[56:27.900 --> 56:34.820]  safe to stand by a burning car and you shouldn't render aid and then I saw
[56:34.820 --> 56:38.020]  people claiming to be firefighters saying yeah every time we have a car fire
[56:38.020 --> 56:41.300]  there's people that stop and try to help and flap their jaws only we should be
[56:41.300 --> 56:45.260]  dealing with it just a bunch of bull this attitude only people in uniforms can
[56:45.260 --> 56:50.300]  help anybody so I guess that's normal somebody gets shot and you just walk
[56:50.300 --> 56:54.500]  over their body somebody comes in steps over the body blood because I want my
[56:54.500 --> 56:59.820]  cigarettes I want my liquor and that's people in a trance ladies and gentlemen

[01:00:27.380 --> 01:00:33.820]  appreciate him joining us on the second day of the new year it has begun nurses
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:37.660]  and doctors and people aren't getting paid all over the country under obozo
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:43.580]  care and there's all these videos and reports of obama supporters now getting
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.860]  their bills for themselves and their children and seeing the giant increases
[01:00:47.860 --> 01:00:53.300]  in prices and there's a professor we're gonna get to after the congressman
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:59.340]  leaves us at the bottom of the hour who has now come out and said it's racist
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:05.460]  white people are the reason obama care is not working and you're like well
[01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:12.740]  what's his proof he doesn't he doesn't have any proof southern white radicals
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:19.300]  are the are to blame for the debacle and then and then he doesn't give any he
[01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:23.860]  doesn't give any reasons in there it's just that well the white people did it
[01:01:23.860 --> 01:01:30.140]  like if a black person's or hispanic or anybody else falls on a banana peel it's
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:37.180]  white people's fault and again all I care about is having freedom and having
[01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:41.060]  everybody be super successful and have free association just be human beings
[01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:45.140]  but that too is why I'm deeply racist because I sound like Martin Luther King
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:50.020]  don't judge you by the color of their skin but but by their deeds and their
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:54.860]  conduct that that's what I'm looking for I'd vote for Hispanic president black
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:02:00.620]  president Chinese president today if they were a libertarian if they were a
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:06.460]  true patriot they were honorable they had a history of being honorable it's
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:16.100]  that simple I would devote for a mayor if they were pro-gun and pro-private
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:21.020]  property rights across the board and wouldn't try to persecute and take
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:26.260]  other people's rights then I'd vote for them if they were quote gay the issue is
[01:02:26.260 --> 01:02:30.460]  are they trying to run other people's lives and take people's freedom and I
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:34.460]  don't care what color you are what sexual preference you are where you come
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:38.980]  from whatever it is if you try to put me in guilt and you try to run my life and
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:44.900]  henpeck me with social engineering man I'm done with you I'm done with you and
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:49.900]  I want you out of my life okay I don't want to associate with you I don't want
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:52.860]  to be around you but see you could not associate with somebody if you don't
[01:02:52.860 --> 01:02:55.940]  like them in private life what about government what about corporations that
[01:02:55.940 --> 01:03:00.540]  run government now they will not get out of our lives they will not leave us
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:07.620]  alone and they're pushing for a decisive victory against the liberty
[01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:10.780]  movement before the liberty movement gets too big and so what are they gonna
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:15.260]  do they're gonna stage false flag attacks or they're gonna let groups
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:22.620]  attack us that they fund up the food chain three four payments removed from
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:30.380]  the source this is how we've caught them and then they use that fear that they
[01:03:30.380 --> 01:03:35.540]  hype up in mass psychology to stampede us towards giving up our freedom look
[01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:41.540]  freedom produces wealth freedom produces choice freedom is good it's not cool to
[01:03:41.540 --> 01:03:47.460]  be into tyranny so many people who work for corporations and work for the police
[01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:53.140]  and any and even the military believe it's all about their power and their
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:57.820]  dominant and their winning and they get into evil but most military people I
[01:03:57.820 --> 01:04:00.620]  know really believe in the mission they've been conned they've been
[01:04:00.620 --> 01:04:04.220]  manipulated and they believe they're defending America while America is being
[01:04:04.220 --> 01:04:10.580]  dismantled the difference is now the military has woken up and so I don't
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:15.180]  know what the establishment is going to do now I mean you've got these morons out
[01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:19.180]  there they've got a bunch of these trips I see him advertised much advertising as
[01:04:19.180 --> 01:04:22.860]  I see for it I looked it up there's a lot of these ships that go to the Antarctic
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:28.180]  and the Arctic and they advertise go see the disappearing north and south poles
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:33.660]  you can look up those ads like Al Gore's God and you know it's gonna melt by 2013
[01:04:33.660 --> 01:04:38.660]  as he said so in 2007 it's the biggest it's been in 50 years both the north and
[01:04:38.660 --> 01:04:41.980]  south pole so they got saved today meanwhile there's record cold temperatures
[01:04:41.980 --> 01:04:46.220]  all over the place some of the coldest temperatures last hundred years in
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:50.900]  North America and they go oh that's proof of the global warming that's
[01:04:50.900 --> 01:04:54.900]  proof of the climate change well now it's climate change of course there's
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:05:01.180]  climate change that's the only thing that's constant is change Alex Jones here

[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:34.300]  didn't launch the attack and then notice now that they're giving up their
[01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:38.100]  chemical weapons it turns out that al-qaeda are the ones that launched it
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:41.860]  that's even been in Congress now they got caught they filmed it and bragged
[01:09:41.860 --> 01:09:47.340]  about it so it was not a side did that obviously we're gonna invade you if you
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:51.860]  use chemical weapons so then he does and then al-qaeda wants to brag and be
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:55.540]  rock stars and shoots video of themselves doing it screaming we love you
[01:09:55.540 --> 01:09:59.160]  bin Laden in Arabic and firing the missiles I mean it's incredible so the
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.380]  congressman Jones helped stop that for now and something he's doing that man I
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:09.700]  literally have said a prayer for him on he's trying to get all the secret of
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:17.780]  9-11 intelligence that C. Bell Edmonds was an NSA FBI interceptor she heard it
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:22.580]  was the elements of the CIA running al-qaeda talking to bin Laden protecting
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:27.100]  the hijackers out of Saudi Arabia I talked to the head of the US embassy over
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.980]  in Saudi Arabia Mr. Springman and he said they were ordered to let him back
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:35.020]  into the US being told they were really CIA double agents that's Muhammad
[01:10:35.020 --> 01:10:39.820]  and others so there's a reason that we need to get these declassified or released
[01:10:39.820 --> 01:10:43.140]  and he's pushing to get that done and you to pray that nothing happens to him
[01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.060]  when he's driving down the road or flying on an airplane because this is the
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:50.740]  type of stuff they'll come after you about you know Colonel Schaefer was
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:55.060]  over stratus ivy and other programs could have killed bin Laden not once not
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:59.540]  twice but even more times they were ordered to stand down this is in the
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.820]  months before 9-11 so there's good elements in the government there's
[01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:08.860]  also bad criminal elements and Saudi Arabia now controls what goes in our
[01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:12.100]  movies what goes on mainstream television just like communist China does
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:16.980]  and they are really pushing because 15 of the 19 hijackers came from there to
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:21.260]  stop this info from coming out here's the article from Ben Schwann dot com it's
[01:11:21.260 --> 01:11:26.460]  up on info wars dot com congressman absolutely shocked a foreign state
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:32.420]  involvement behind 9-11 attacks and the video is right there if al-qaeda had
[01:11:32.420 --> 01:11:36.140]  support from foreign governments during 9-11 should the public know about it
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:39.220]  many americans are demanding and especially those who lost loved ones
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:44.700]  representative walter jones representative steven lynch said they
[01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:48.820]  were absolutely shocked a level of foreign state involvement in the attacks
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:52.340]  after reading the classified section of the 9-11 report but he's barred from
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:56.660]  telling us what he saw well I've reversed engineered it and I've talked to
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:12:01.140]  sebel admins who seen saw it when it came in so I know cuz she testified to
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:05.780]  congress but I don't know how much he can say confirming our report but sir we
[01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:08.860]  appreciate your courage thanks for joining us in the new year
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:12.500]  well alex thank you very much for giving me a chance to talk about this
[01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.500]  issue because the american people have every right to know it's certainly the
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:21.780]  families that you made reference to of 9-11 who lost loved ones they certainly
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:27.380]  have a right to know and I want to start my comments very briefly the senator
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:31.940]  that I have great respect for that is not no longer in the Senate is Bob Graham
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:37.420]  from Florida he was one of the co-chairs of the 9-11 Commission he pushed and
[01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:43.100]  still is pushing even though he's left the Senate that this these 28 pages be
[01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:48.020]  made public and let me share one sentence from him an article I read
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:53.220]  recently I was stunned that the intelligence committee excuse me
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:57.460]  community would feel that it was a threat to national security for the American
[01:12:57.460 --> 01:13:04.660]  people to know who made 9-11 financially possible who made 9-11
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:10.580]  financially possible said Senator Graham and I am sad to report that today some
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:15.780]  12 years after we submitted our report that those 28 pages continue to be with
[01:13:15.780 --> 01:13:20.340]  health and the public and alex that's why Steven Lynch and I have joined
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:26.660]  together to put in house resolution 428 and I'd like to say right now to any of
[01:13:26.660 --> 01:13:31.620]  your listeners whichever state you live in call your member of the house your
[01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:40.620]  member of the house and say join in house resolution 428 428 and ask that the
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:46.380]  president United States made these make these 28 pages public it is the public's
[01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:50.460]  right to know the truth so thank you very much for giving me this change oh
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:55.820]  thank you sir and I forget it was it six or seven of the 10 commissioners even in
[01:13:55.820 --> 01:14:00.460]  the New York Times reported years ago said quote it was a whitewash a fraud if
[01:14:00.460 --> 01:14:04.540]  the American people only knew I mean I've read their quotes before on air I
[01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:09.500]  think you're right six it was six six so so the majority said it was a fraud we're
[01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:12.740]  gonna pull up some of those articles for people watching on TV but radio
[01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:16.180]  listeners can just search that yeah there's the one in guarding in 9-11 the
[01:14:16.180 --> 01:14:20.140]  big cover-up even the chair of the 9-11 Commission now admits that the official
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:25.580]  evidence they were given was far from the truth congressman Jones well Alex
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:30.820]  the whole point what Graham says and that's what we and many of us and you
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:36.900]  mentioned some but also Steve Lynch and I believe so sincerely the American
[01:14:36.900 --> 01:14:44.180]  people have a right to know who made 9-11 financial financially possible who
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:48.940]  financed the terrorists that came over here and took over 3,000 Americans and
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:55.100]  their lives and and this is simply about the truth and there is no hope for the
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:59.900]  government if the government covers up the truth and that's exactly what is
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:05.060]  happening here and that's why Stephen Lynch and I believe to a Republican and
[01:15:05.060 --> 01:15:10.900]  a Democrat believes sincerely that the 28 pages need to be declassified and I'm
[01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:16.180]  pleased to say that Bob Graham has led this fight for almost 14 years now well
[01:15:16.180 --> 01:15:20.140]  yes sir the the good news is is that Sabelle Edmonds and others but she
[01:15:20.140 --> 01:15:24.700]  broke her gag order of course she testified many times secretly and in
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:29.140]  closed session with Congress as you know and she said what's in those pages is
[01:15:29.140 --> 01:15:34.660]  that the Saudi intelligence was involved in financing it so that they could
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:40.300]  blame it on Iraq their arch enemies at the time and a bandar Prince Bandar who's
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:44.940]  the head of Saudi intelligence now was up to his eyeballs in it then and that
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:48.860]  he's the guy bragging to Russia three months ago and then before that in
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:52.740]  August that they would attack Russia using al-Qaeda if they didn't support the
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:57.540]  takeover of Syria by al-Qaeda now I know you can't violate you know your
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:02.740]  congressional national security agreements but at a point they use this to
[01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:08.700]  hide the tyranny behind I mean what can you tell us about the 28 pages they much
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:13.580]  of what you've just shared with your listeners and viewers is exactly what
[01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:18.980]  has been made public from experts within the system that know the truth that
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:23.780]  we're trying to even lynch and I'll try to expose is that 28 pages that have
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:27.860]  been declassified yeah and we are the same guy that just bombed Russia was
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:33.420]  involved in 9-11 and when you really look at it Alex the previous American
[01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:39.420]  administration and and the fact that they covered this toward these 28 pages up
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:43.860]  there is no reason that the American people get through their members of
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:49.420]  Congress to ask them to join us in H resolution 428 should not be able to
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:52.980]  say to the president United States and that's what our resolution says to the
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:57.020]  president it happens to be Mr. Obama could be anyone else at this time but it
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:03.140]  is President Obama to declassify these 28 pages allow the American people allow
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:08.980]  the 9-11 families to know the truth the truth will set you free and that's why
[01:17:08.980 --> 01:17:12.500]  it is so critical and we're gonna continue to beat this drum and I want
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:16.260]  to thank you for being on your show for a few minutes oh you bet so we need we
[01:17:16.260 --> 01:17:19.580]  need the listeners to pick up the phone and call their members of Congress
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:23.860]  they'll be going back the house will be going back next Tuesday and say sign
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:30.300]  your name to resolution 428 let the truth set you free well said
[01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:34.820]  Congressman Jones from North Carolina this is so important people need to
[01:17:34.820 --> 01:17:40.340]  physically go down when their Congress people are at meet and greets they
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:43.540]  need to physically go to their churches when they're there people need to stand
[01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:48.420]  up and bring this up people need to call in to talk radio they need to get this
[01:17:48.420 --> 01:17:53.140]  out there because if we can expose this the whole house of cards falls what do
[01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:56.740]  you make and we can do this when we get together what do you make of the big
[01:17:56.740 --> 01:18:01.340]  victory led by yourself and many others to not expand the air war to back Al
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:07.060]  Qaeda as Rand Paul the senator said we don't need to be Al Qaeda's Air Force
[01:18:07.060 --> 01:18:10.340]  Ted Cruz said the same thing you basically said the same thing and then
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:13.460]  finally the chairman of the Joint Chiefs went to Obama and said the military is
[01:18:13.460 --> 01:18:17.660]  gonna stand down I mean that really to me shows that there is an awakening
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:22.140]  happening well there is and that I want to thank you Alex and all the hosting
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:26.620]  and hostess like yourself across this nation that just don't accept what the
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.940]  left or the right says as as as truth but you seek the truth and expose the
[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:38.180]  truth and you know this is the way I look at this it's just like Syria the
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:42.100]  president wanted to bypass Congress the mess when you have me on your show at
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:46.580]  the time because I said any president be Democratic Republican that bypasses the
[01:18:46.580 --> 01:18:51.420]  Congress and one American dies and on foreign land that president should be
[01:18:51.420 --> 01:18:56.060]  impeached this whole issue that drones which is another issue at another time
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.740]  it is time for the American people to take back the government by demanding
[01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:04.460]  the House and Senate follow the Constitution and the president follows
[01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:10.700]  the Constitution and you can start by declassifying these 28 pages absolutely
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:14.660]  we've got to go to break and if you need to leave we'll let you go or just say
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.420]  about 15 more minutes if you'd like oh that's very gracious of you sir yes or
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:21.860]  we got a little break we're gonna come back in a little six seven minute
[01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:24.500]  segment with you sir and then we'll let you get out of here but I want to hear
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:28.460]  what else is front and center on your radar because again you help lead the
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:31.300]  charge and I know you don't want to credit we're just pointing out that
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:36.820]  having a few good people in Congress can turn the tide on gun control on open
[01:19:36.820 --> 01:19:43.060]  borders on NSA garbage on on funding radical Islam I want to talk about what
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:47.740]  else is front and center like trying to keep troops now to 2017 in Afghanistan
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:51.380]  I know you've spearheaded trying to get our men and women back out of that map

[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:33.740]  Carolina Congressman Walter Jones joins us in this short segment to get into the
[01:24:33.740 --> 01:24:36.980]  expansion we keep being told the troops are gonna come home next year than they
[01:24:36.980 --> 01:24:40.300]  never do now they've extended it out again and then I wanted to get his take
[01:24:40.300 --> 01:24:46.100]  on the on the state of our economy and the budget sir please tell us what's
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:51.700]  happening well Alex first let me say I have been outspoken on staying in
[01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:56.140]  Afghanistan for 10 more years the president has been negotiating with cars I a
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:25:00.700]  10-year agreement called the bilateral strategic agreement to keep us there for
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:06.140]  10 more years with a limited number of our soldiers the Marines and sailors and
[01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:10.900]  airmen but the problem is as long as we have one in uniform on the ground they
[01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:15.460]  could be shot and killed or have their legs blown off I do not understand why
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:20.140]  either party and I'm critical my own Republican party why they want to
[01:25:20.140 --> 01:25:25.300]  continue to obligate this country which is financially broke meaning America to
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:31.500]  10 more years of spending an average of $7 billion a month in Afghanistan it is
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:37.300]  not worth one pint of blood and it's not worth $1 and I do not understand why
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:41.980]  both parties are not receiving more and more pressure from the American people
[01:25:41.980 --> 01:25:47.180]  the American people have already spoken almost 80% said that Afghanistan is not
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:52.340]  worth one more dime and I hope some of your listeners also will continue to
[01:25:52.340 --> 01:25:57.340]  call their members of Congress and say stop your stupidity of sending money to
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:26:03.140]  a crook in air in Afghanistan that does not even respect your your nation what
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:07.940]  do you make of the former vice president Dick Cheney saying that our size
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:11.540]  basically a good guy a guy that helped us and then he won't say he's corrupt
[01:26:11.540 --> 01:26:16.220]  when he's a known opium dealer well all I would say is that Dick Cheney got us
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.140]  into an unnecessary war known as Iraq so I don't have much respect for his
[01:26:20.140 --> 01:26:23.300]  opinion well I think you answered the question why they want to keep us there
[01:26:23.300 --> 01:26:27.980]  forever seven million dollars a month to select contractors no one's ever
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:32.660]  beaten the Afghans everybody always gets run out and they knew when they went
[01:26:32.660 --> 01:26:37.220]  in there that we wouldn't quote win the winning is sucking is dry Alex you
[01:26:37.220 --> 01:26:42.980]  exactly right we have spent over $1.5 trillion in Iraq and Afghanistan and
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:46.820]  that's why it makes no sense your listeners need to call and race came
[01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:51.820]  with their members of Congress and stop funding Afghanistan because there is no
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:56.740]  way we can have any accountability of the dollars going there and as you just
[01:26:56.740 --> 01:27:02.100]  said a few are getting rich off the backs of the poor American taxpayer who
[01:27:02.100 --> 01:27:06.820]  has to borrow money from the Chinese to pay Karzai in Afghanistan and that's
[01:27:06.820 --> 01:27:11.700]  another issue now the communist president over there to prepare for the
[01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:16.660]  war with the US two days ago this is really starting to get serious the
[01:27:16.660 --> 01:27:21.180]  stock markets down even with the devalued dollar where do you see our budget
[01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:25.340]  going where do you see our economy going well until this nation gets a
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:31.140]  national leader like Iran Paul that will say that it is time to rebuild and fix
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:35.260]  America's problems and not the world's problems then we will continue to be a
[01:27:35.260 --> 01:27:39.860]  debtor nation what is the sense of the Congress I mean they've got to know
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:42.820]  they're on the deck of the Titanic why are they accelerating towards the
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:49.300]  iceberg Alex because they are not enough people like yourself across this
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:54.980]  nation to educate and wake up the American people before it's too late and
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:28:00.940]  by too late historically how bad do you think it's going to get in this country
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:06.180]  well I still believe that we're headed for a collapse I mean I'm glad that some
[01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:10.860]  people are doing well on Wall Street I'm glad that the the home building is
[01:28:10.860 --> 01:28:15.460]  coming back from across our nation and and but I would tell you the truth when
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:18.780]  you got to borrow money to pay your bills and that's exactly what the Ryan
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:23.980]  Murray budget did it raised the spending to keep our government running over a
[01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:29.420]  trillion dollars a year and and it's all we're doing is raising the debt ceiling
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:34.260]  which I vote against every time I can to borrow more money to spend more money
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:38.700]  and it's not even our money we're spending it makes no sense well said
[01:28:38.700 --> 01:28:44.620]  what's the best website for people to visit your house website or well the
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:49.340]  house website Walter B. Jones and that they can go on it very easily and I
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:54.500]  wish they would remember one thing Alex call your member of Congress if you
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:58.140]  don't live in Eastern North Carolina that I represent call your member of
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:04.300]  Congress and ask them to get on Resolution 428 to class to declassify
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:10.020]  the 28 pages so we can wake up America to who finance 9-11 yeah well that's the
[01:29:10.020 --> 01:29:12.940]  big issue here and you've seen the documents and then you said that
[01:29:12.940 --> 01:29:17.820]  basically with C. Bell Edmonds the FBI NSA translator said he is he is the
[01:29:17.820 --> 01:29:21.860]  accurate info and that's come out we know it's Saudi Arabia but we need that
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:26.340]  to come out so that we can we can understand who our real enemy is the
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:31.140]  same group funding Al Qaeda all over the Middle East sir thank you so much for

[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:23.580]  Dr. Sherry Tenpenny and Dr. Sherry Tenpenny is the leading you'd have to
[01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:28.980]  say medical doctor out there who runs her own large clinics in the US and in
[01:34:28.980 --> 01:34:34.980]  other nations on a host of fronts with the latest in medical technology so
[01:34:34.980 --> 01:34:40.260]  she's she's also a leader of leaders the top in her field and she was the
[01:34:40.260 --> 01:34:46.180]  doctor we had on along with Dr. Russell Blalock and others who were on this
[01:34:46.180 --> 01:34:50.700]  radio show during the whole H1N1 hoax pointing out that it lowered your
[01:34:50.700 --> 01:34:54.420]  immune system didn't protect you from the regular flu and then later that all
[01:34:54.420 --> 01:34:59.940]  came out in governmental studies in Canada the UK you name it and now though
[01:34:59.940 --> 01:35:05.700]  this year I am seeing people dying of basically meningitis which is viruses
[01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.780]  attack in the lining of the brain for those that don't know we are seeing
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:15.820]  people dying from a high-powered bacteria strep and others I've had family
[01:35:15.820 --> 01:35:22.020]  die from it and a family fighting for their lives right now and I don't see
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:24.980]  the media covering it locally people are saying mystery illness you know
[01:35:24.980 --> 01:35:28.020]  killing half the people that get admitted to the hospital with it
[01:35:28.020 --> 01:35:32.540]  during the H1N1 you'd have a person with diabetes who was 75 years old and
[01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:36.620]  alcoholic and had half their organs replaced and then they got the flu
[01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:41.140]  and died they said the flu did it well no it was complications from the flu so
[01:35:41.140 --> 01:35:44.940]  when there's not an issue I've noticed they hype it when there is an issue they
[01:35:44.940 --> 01:35:49.100]  tell you everything's fine so when it get her take and her breakdown on reports
[01:35:49.100 --> 01:35:54.020]  of these mystery illnesses what's happening out there and then break down
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:56.900]  the fact that they're trying to force people in New York to take all these
[01:35:56.900 --> 01:36:00.260]  vaccines they're trying to force medical practitioners to take it they're
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:03.980]  trying to give kids vaccines without parental consent and doing it in places
[01:36:03.980 --> 01:36:08.620]  like California to really have the floor for the rest of the hour them to
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:12.020]  cover all the other news and take your calls in the next hour to give us her
[01:36:12.020 --> 01:36:20.940]  expert report on the state of flu 2013 2014 and medical tyranny 10 penny IMC
[01:36:20.940 --> 01:36:24.860]  comm is just one of her websites Dr. Sherry 10 penny thank you for joining us
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:28.700]  good afternoon Alex thank you so much for having me you bet well you heard me
[01:36:28.700 --> 01:36:32.420]  throw out those points mystery illness and then the latest on medical
[01:36:32.420 --> 01:36:36.980]  tyranny well I think that there we're seeing now more and more of the
[01:36:36.980 --> 01:36:41.300]  vaccines that are coming home to roost that they are causing more and more
[01:36:41.300 --> 01:36:46.100]  medical problems you know you can't fool mother nature and as you start to
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:51.020]  eliminate certain bacteria by the vaccines other bacteria and viruses fill
[01:36:51.020 --> 01:36:55.620]  in the gap for example they have now shown and discovered in research
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:00.740]  articles that the pertussis vaccine which has been eliminating the pertussis
[01:37:00.740 --> 01:37:05.540]  bacteria and we've been seeing the increase rates of pertussis going up
[01:37:05.540 --> 01:37:08.500]  they've been trying to figure out why that is well there was an article that
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:12.700]  came out a couple of weeks ago that said that because the pertussis vaccine
[01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:18.180]  eliminates the border tell a pertussis bacteria it has created a gap in which
[01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:22.820]  another bacteria called border tell a pair of pertussis is filling in the gap
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:27.620]  and now that they're finding that that bacteria may have that border tell a
[01:37:27.620 --> 01:37:32.580]  pair of pair of pertussis may have increased more than 40 times in these
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:37.780]  children that have had a pertussis vaccine so now they are developing
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.060]  whooping cough or symptoms that look like whooping cop but maybe not quite as
[01:37:41.060 --> 01:37:44.100]  severe as whooping cough and they're finding that it's being caused by this
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:48.820]  new bacteria called para pertussis and I think that's happening with all of the
[01:37:48.820 --> 01:37:53.580]  Prevnar vaccines for strap it certainly happened for him that as we
[01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:58.460]  eliminated hemophilus influenza B there are more strains of that bacteria
[01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:01.980]  falling in the gap that are more stronger and more virulent we're seeing it with
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.380]  meningitis vaccines and of course that's going to happen with all this
[01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:09.540]  manipulation of what we're doing with the influenza vaccines so it's just like
[01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:15.220]  when you give these super powerful antibiotics to chickens it makes them
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:19.300]  produce super deadly bacteria that when we eat it kills us according to Reuters
[01:38:19.300 --> 01:38:25.580]  and their medical reporters I mean this is incredible it's just more and more of
[01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:29.340]  the same in fact even when they select the three viruses that they're going to
[01:38:29.340 --> 01:38:33.180]  put into the flu shot each year they take those viruses into the laboratory
[01:38:33.180 --> 01:38:37.500]  and they manipulate them so that they create a new virus that really doesn't
[01:38:37.500 --> 01:38:41.300]  even match the one that's out in circulation but a new virus that allows
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:45.260]  it to grow well either in eggs which is still the current way that they make
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:49.700]  vaccines or flu shots or that it will grow well in the cell cultures that
[01:38:49.700 --> 01:38:54.420]  they're not developing that are made from dog kidney cells caterpillar eggs and
[01:38:54.420 --> 01:38:59.180]  cells of aborted of cells of retinas from a boarded fetal to doesn't that
[01:38:59.180 --> 01:39:03.820]  create a mutagenic effect sometimes splicing with the other you know human
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:08.460]  DNA with the RNA well absolutely and when you look at the package inserts of
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:12.460]  every single one of the vaccines it will say this vaccine has not been stuttered
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:17.700]  studied for carcinogenic potential it's not been studied for mutagenic potential
[01:39:17.700 --> 01:39:21.460]  it's not been studied to see whether or not it changes anything in your DNA but
[01:39:21.460 --> 01:39:26.420]  yet we are giving 40 doses of 16 different vaccines to children to where
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:32.900]  they get over 180 vaccine antigens by the time they are in junior high now and
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:36.220]  then we have all the studies about if you get three flu shots it doubles your
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:40.020]  chances for Alzheimer's the IQ is dropping there's more neurological
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:44.420]  disorders about a year after you broke this news the Canadian study admitted
[01:39:44.420 --> 01:39:48.980]  four years ago that the H1N1 shot doubled your chances of getting the
[01:39:48.980 --> 01:39:53.900]  regular flu and then things just get worse and worse and worse and everyone I
[01:39:53.900 --> 01:39:58.980]  know everyone I know including man Cal Muller as a stunt he took the flu shot
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:05.100]  was the sickest in his life even the CNN red coat Pierce Morgan took it and
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.980]  literally said it almost killed him over a month within six days after taking it
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:14.580]  my mother when she was a triathlete and a UT master swimmers had to be 15 years
[01:40:14.580 --> 01:40:20.060]  ago they told him take it she's never been sick almost killed her my uncle not
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:24.780]  the one that's sick now but my uncle Joe got talked into one almost killed him I
[01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:29.860]  mean everybody I know that takes it literally almost dies I mean what is in
[01:40:29.860 --> 01:40:34.740]  it Dr. 10 penny well I don't know that everyone almost dies but I could say
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:37.980]  that there's a very large number of people that certainly do get sick I'm
[01:40:37.980 --> 01:40:42.340]  saying the people I know get super is have gotten super ill well I know but
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:46.020]  I'm talking about as a general sure sure yeah you know that there's a lot of
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:49.820]  people that do get very sick and I think there's a couple reasons from it I
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.260]  mean one is that the multi-dose flu shots still have mercury in them the
[01:40:53.260 --> 01:40:57.580]  multi-dose vials still have mercury there are stray viruses in there that
[01:40:57.580 --> 01:41:01.740]  come from birds and from cows that they cannot genetically remove or
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:06.020]  manufacturingly removed from the vaccines at all and I also know that they
[01:41:06.020 --> 01:41:10.540]  estimate that there's somewhere around six billion viruses in a flu in each one
[01:41:10.540 --> 01:41:16.260]  of the flu so how can they absolutely say with a hundred percent certainty that
[01:41:16.260 --> 01:41:21.340]  all six billion of those viruses have been attenuated weakened or killed in
[01:41:21.340 --> 01:41:25.780]  order for that to get injected into you and is there a pretty high probability
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:30.780]  that you're actually being injected with viruses that are still quite active and
[01:41:30.780 --> 01:41:36.020]  I think the answer to that is yes well you said whenever they were testing
[01:41:36.020 --> 01:41:39.060]  Gardasil eight years ago it was killing people later it came out it was killing
[01:41:39.060 --> 01:41:43.660]  people in the trials India made it illegal after so many people died but
[01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:46.940]  here they just continue and now you know that new study came out two weeks ago
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:51.580]  about what it's doing to women's fertility and we had all surmised that it
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:54.580]  was really an anti-fertility vaccine that's why they're giving it to all the
[01:41:54.580 --> 01:42:00.140]  Mexican girls in Mexico you know Alex I brought that up probably three years
[01:42:00.140 --> 01:42:04.900]  ago now that's saying that the Gardasil vaccine that the polysorbate 80 and the
[01:42:04.900 --> 01:42:10.860]  combination of that with the high dose of aluminum and with borax causes
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:15.260]  testicular atrophy in little boys and ovarian atrophy and uterine atrophy in
[01:42:15.260 --> 01:42:19.140]  little girl mice and if it was happening in mice we use mice studies for
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:22.300]  everything that there was going to be a high probability that was going to
[01:42:22.300 --> 01:42:25.260]  happen that in an ovarian atrophy in a
[01:42:25.260 --> 01:42:30.020]  testicular atrophy in little human boys and girls now we've got the highest
[01:42:30.020 --> 01:42:34.100]  incidence of infertility we've got the lowest birth rate of teenage girls ever
[01:42:34.100 --> 01:42:38.980]  and I can't think it's just because the kids are having less sex no I mean this
[01:42:38.980 --> 01:42:43.780]  is eugenics this is to sterilize people this is to reduce fertility this is the
[01:42:43.780 --> 01:42:48.980]  IMF World Bank UN's own statement and I remember interviewing you and others
[01:42:48.980 --> 01:42:53.980]  back when they were doing the studies eight years ago and and evidence of
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:57.940]  infertility and autoimmune disorders and I know in the last three years you've
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:02.620]  intensified that but we've known day one targeting girls lying and saying it's
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.980]  the law you've got to take it Rick Perry such a bold move and the fact that it
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:10.620]  was hurting people when they gave it to them and didn't protect them from almost
[01:43:10.620 --> 01:43:16.140]  all the strains I mean this is clear what do you make of them now saying we
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:21.300]  have anti-stress vaccines that go in and attack areas of the brain literally a
[01:43:21.300 --> 01:43:26.700]  lobotomy so you never feel bad again I mean we're living in something like a
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:33.860]  kin to a combination of brave new world and the body snatchers yeah there are
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:37.300]  two of those vaccines that they're actually under development now one came
[01:43:37.300 --> 01:43:40.300]  out came that they mentioned several years ago they were going to call it fun
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:45.980]  backs oh name fun backs to take out the area of your brain we're fundamentalists
[01:43:45.980 --> 01:43:50.300]  where the we're fundamentalists their brain lights up whether you are very
[01:43:50.300 --> 01:43:54.580]  very intensely involved with something now that could be fun to let fundamentalism
[01:43:54.580 --> 01:43:57.940]  in terms of Islam or it could be fundamentalist Christians or it could be
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:44:01.420]  just people who get really excited about their job and that they are just sort of
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:04.180]  zealots about it that's the little boys they want to put on riddle and they
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:09.660]  want to burn out that human spark of resistance exactly zombie shot and now
[01:44:09.660 --> 01:44:13.060]  they're actually talking about another one that they're talking about trialing
[01:44:13.060 --> 01:44:16.980]  with the military that will take out areas of their brain for which they may
[01:44:16.980 --> 01:44:21.540]  have PSTD and post-traumatic stress so that they can just level them out and
[01:44:21.540 --> 01:44:27.340]  make them probably into Manchurian candidates it's very sad Alex it's it's
[01:44:27.340 --> 01:44:32.260]  very sad to see what's happening now more and more and more with the vaccine
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:36.660]  development because when I started into this back in September of 2000 the
[01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:41.260]  vaccine industry was about a 10 billion dollar of your industry now it's in the
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:45.780]  30 to 60 billion some of the vaccines are making 5 to 10 billion on their own
[01:44:45.780 --> 01:44:50.940]  and so we are just using little human beings and adults too I mean we put a
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:56.740]  lot of focus on children but adults are just repository of drugs and vaccines
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:01.060]  for the pharmaceutical industry and at some point everything is just going to
[01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:05.260]  have to break the human body has a tremendous capacity to be able to
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:10.580]  compensate and overcome these things that we're doing to it not only from our
[01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:15.340]  foods or from chemtrails and GMO foods fluoride in the water all these
[01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:19.540]  vaccines all of these medications that we're giving people I mean now the
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:24.620]  expanded medication recommendation for more Lipitor for more people I mean at
[01:45:24.620 --> 01:45:29.020]  some point the human body is just not going to be able to compensate anymore
[01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:33.060]  but I want to stop you right there Dr. Sherrie Tenpin medical doctor leading
[01:45:33.060 --> 01:45:40.220]  expert on so much of this if you go back and if you look at this we're
[01:45:40.220 --> 01:45:45.660]  calmly talking about vaccines anti-stress vaccines anti-ptsd vaccines
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:50.460]  that literally go in and destroy areas of the brain associated with the highest
[01:45:50.460 --> 01:45:56.660]  brainwaves with spiritual experiences with with with literature with art I
[01:45:56.660 --> 01:46:00.340]  showed a study yesterday it was in the Daily Mail about people that are
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:04.500]  religious have more brain cells and and higher volume and higher intelligence
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:10.060]  they they want to cut out that that's what they're targeting and so all the
[01:46:10.060 --> 01:46:13.780]  troops are upset about six seven tears of immoral war let's just give them a
[01:46:13.780 --> 01:46:18.460]  vaccine so they never upset again you're literally giving them a lobotomy the
[01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:23.900]  magnitude of that doctor that we're living in 2014 this is rolling out
[01:46:23.900 --> 01:46:28.700]  they're drugging 20% of kids with all these anti-psychotics and stuff I mean
[01:46:28.700 --> 01:46:33.420]  we're living in the twilight zone you know Alex every time I go to the store or
[01:46:33.420 --> 01:46:36.580]  go to the mall or walk down the street and I see all these young people with
[01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:42.620]  these little bitty babies in their arms it makes me sad I mean we as a as a human
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:46.460]  race should be celebrating a birth and looking forward to what's going to
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:50.220]  happen to these children and hopefully that they'll have a better life and a
[01:46:50.220 --> 01:46:54.340]  better future than what you and I had or even what our kids had and you look at
[01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:58.500]  these young children and you think what is the world gonna look like to them by
[01:46:58.500 --> 01:47:02.340]  the time they get to be 20 years of age all of these different things all these
[01:47:02.340 --> 01:47:06.940]  vaccines of parents when are parents going to just stop and wake up and do
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:11.620]  something as simple as read a package insert on a drug or a vaccine and not
[01:47:11.620 --> 01:47:15.860]  just blindly follow the person in front of them because they happen to have on
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:19.100]  a white coat when are they going to stop doing this when are they going to
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:24.700]  understand that the systematic poisoning of their children in no way keeps
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:29.260]  them healthy and this is social engineering as the head of the
[01:47:29.260 --> 01:47:33.340]  Thabian Socialist Bertrand Russell said diet injections and injunctions will
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:37.580]  bring in the social control I've got all this globalist literature by the White
[01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:41.860]  House science are holding others about using the water supply adding chemicals
[01:47:41.860 --> 01:47:46.860]  of vaccines to control us undoubtedly that's what it's doing it came out as
[01:47:46.860 --> 01:47:49.740]  you know that the German elite the British elite the Chinese elite none of
[01:47:49.740 --> 01:47:55.220]  them take these vaccines they have special vaccines they take I'm not even
[01:47:55.220 --> 01:47:59.060]  debating the science of vaccine if something's bad enough clearly the
[01:47:59.060 --> 01:48:03.740]  science of immunization is real though there's a cost benefit analysis for my
[01:48:03.740 --> 01:48:07.580]  layman research the problem is all these big medical firms caught doing all
[01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:11.740]  this secret research on people before all this lethal research Hitler got his
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:15.700]  ideas from the US and Britain Hitler was going to use vaccines to control
[01:48:15.700 --> 01:48:20.660]  people it's been done to us we have to admit we're under attack and now as
[01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:24.380]  you've exposed urge on Joyce Rowley a few weeks ago get into the medical
[01:48:24.380 --> 01:48:29.900]  tyranny how they're trying to force them now well that has that hasn't really
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:33.580]  changed and in terms of what's happening with children but now that they're
[01:48:33.580 --> 01:48:39.740]  forcing healthcare workers to have a flu shot in exchange for a paycheck where
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:43.380]  do we stop with that are the I've seen a couple of papers that have come out
[01:48:43.380 --> 01:48:46.900]  that saying okay now that we've got the doctors and nurses doing flu shots now
[01:48:46.900 --> 01:48:51.380]  we can also mandate the next level of shots we can make them get a booster of
[01:48:51.380 --> 01:48:55.700]  an MMR we can make them reboost on their hepatitis they make them take the
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:49:00.540]  hepatitis I was about to say well but they but let's say that you had that
[01:49:00.540 --> 01:49:04.740]  more than 10 years ago the antibodies don't last that long they could force
[01:49:04.740 --> 01:49:07.860]  you to get a blood test to see if you still have it a what they call a
[01:49:07.860 --> 01:49:12.260]  protective antibody and if you don't make you take the series over again they
[01:49:12.260 --> 01:49:15.920]  could they're already talking about forcing pertussis vaccines on healthcare
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:21.380]  workers and they're also talking about pneumonia shots on vaccine on healthcare
[01:49:21.380 --> 01:49:24.980]  workers even though there have been quite a few articles that have come out
[01:49:24.980 --> 01:49:29.740]  just in the last three to six months that says that if I get a flu shot it
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:33.580]  really does nothing to keep you from getting the flu but we're doing this
[01:49:33.580 --> 01:49:37.740]  and forcing this upon health care workers and when I talk about health care
[01:49:37.740 --> 01:49:41.300]  workers I'm not just talking doctors nurses respiratory therapists people
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:45.500]  that are have interactions with patients I've gotten letters and emails from
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:50.300]  people that one was from a gentleman who says I work in a in the IT department
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:53.780]  of the hospital three blocks down the street from the actual physical
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:57.740]  hospital and they're expecting me to get a flu shot in order to keep my job
[01:49:57.740 --> 01:50:05.300]  where does this stop where does it stop well you're right and they know that if
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:08.580]  they can make city workers and police have GPS in their cars as they're now
[01:50:08.580 --> 01:50:12.260]  doing then the cops will enforce it on us to have to have GPS and tax by the
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:15.660]  mile and they can make medical workers take all the shots then they're gonna
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.540]  believe that well you should have to take them to it's very simple what
[01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:24.060]  they're doing yes and I think that you know it always puzzles me Alex and is
[01:50:24.060 --> 01:50:29.020]  that you know the all of these the elite people and the powers that be that are

[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:43.260]  have a bunch of books and videos from medical doctors and others breaking down
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:47.140]  the dangers of vaccines and I want to explain it isn't that I don't think that
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:51.340]  there couldn't be some science behind it the 500 year old technology you got
[01:54:51.340 --> 01:54:55.140]  something very risky out there sometimes maybe you need a vaccine it's that
[01:54:55.140 --> 01:54:58.860]  these companies and these globalists have hidden agendas and we have the real
[01:54:58.860 --> 01:55:02.780]  numbers the real data Dr. Sherry Tenpenny you're the real expert on this I
[01:55:02.780 --> 01:55:06.620]  mean obviously you take vaccines it makes stuff mutate and gets stronger just
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:10.740]  like antibiotics with bacteria what is your position on vaccines because if
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:14.140]  there was some killer thing out there like the polio in the 50s I would want
[01:55:14.140 --> 01:55:18.020]  a vaccine like my grandmother you know was in an iron lung basically and but
[01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:21.980]  she's still alive today but paralyzed over large parts of her body that my
[01:55:21.980 --> 01:55:26.860]  mother was like four years old my uncle was like you know 10 but my view is
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:31.140]  then I learned it had the eight SV 40 that they say gave a hundred plus
[01:55:31.140 --> 01:55:35.140]  million Americans some form of cancer so it's like you you stop one evil with
[01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:39.020]  something even worse but then it just gets hidden in the literature a Dr.
[01:55:39.020 --> 01:55:42.220]  Sherry Tenpenny what's your view on vaccines and any other key points you'd
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:46.460]  like to add well Alex I started the investigation into the problems
[01:55:46.460 --> 01:55:50.900]  associated with vaccines back in September of 2000 and so now that we
[01:55:50.900 --> 01:55:57.220]  are now into 2014 I can say unish unequivocally that after 13 years of
[01:55:57.220 --> 01:56:03.460]  study and more than I don't know 20,000 hours of research of reading medical
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:08.420]  literature and investigative reports and digging into the science myself I would
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:13.900]  never take a vaccine under any circumstances for any bug because health
[01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:17.140]  cannot come through the needle there is nothing positive that you can ever
[01:56:17.140 --> 01:56:21.660]  inject into your body that doesn't have a side effect the side effect the risk of
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:25.340]  the vaccine is much more dangerous than the risk of the illness and I don't
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:29.940]  care what the illnesses because if I have a an intact immune system that's
[01:56:29.940 --> 01:56:33.780]  healthy that's fed well that's watered well that's slept well that's will
[01:56:33.780 --> 01:56:39.300]  taken care of that's a lot a lot of love in my life developing an antibody in my
[01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:44.500]  bloodstream that can attack my own organs and become an autoimmune disease
[01:56:44.500 --> 01:56:49.380]  and that antibody doesn't even necessarily keep me from contracting some
[01:56:49.380 --> 01:56:52.740]  deadly disease that might be floating around out there in the environment
[01:56:52.740 --> 01:56:58.140]  there is nothing that a vaccine can do in my opinion that is protective
[01:56:58.140 --> 01:57:02.660]  effective or keeps you from getting sick there's no way that I would ever be
[01:57:02.660 --> 01:57:06.540]  subjected to a vaccine under any circumstances I would be take rather
[01:57:06.540 --> 01:57:12.020]  take my risk of keeping my body well and protected against any sort of a
[01:57:12.020 --> 01:57:15.540]  pathogen that's out there I would rather err on the side I can keep myself
[01:57:15.540 --> 01:57:20.100]  healthy rather than to take the risk of what might be coming through that needle
[01:57:20.100 --> 01:57:25.260]  I agree with you and again that's even in the vaccines were good they have the
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:28.380]  bad autoimmune suppressing qualities that have been shown in studies and so
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:32.380]  much more and we're less healthy now they say vaccines where we live longer we
[01:57:32.380 --> 01:57:35.900]  were actually living longer because of sanitation until the 30s and 40s when
[01:57:35.900 --> 01:57:40.540]  vaccines came in in all the global graphs you know that as well and we're
[01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:45.860]  really getting unhealthy now and we're seeing all these superplex pop up from
[01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:50.300]  it and this is really slavery where they make us so sick we can't then live
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:55.300]  without their system and that's what Rockefeller based not even Western
[01:57:55.300 --> 01:58:01.300]  medicine but but but criminal medicine has become yeah I mean it's it's really
[01:58:01.300 --> 01:58:05.380]  that the multi-generational effect that we've had from this and that's what we
[01:58:05.380 --> 01:58:11.460]  have also is multi-generational indoctrination of that vaccines are safe
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:15.100]  effective protective and harmless and they are none of those things so
[01:58:15.100 --> 01:58:19.180]  children that are getting married today in their 20s are listening to their
[01:58:19.180 --> 01:58:23.860]  grandparents go oh there was this thing called polio and oh the vaccine made it
[01:58:23.860 --> 01:58:28.660]  go away and oh what about smallpox which neither of them are true and so we've
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:31.380]  got you know what I know you got to go but can you do five more minutes after
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:36.100]  one-minute break just to talk about polio and smallpox not being true sure
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:40.980]  all right we'll be back in 60 seconds learn to break that down
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:52.540]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network in the last 50 years iodine
[01:58:52.540 --> 01:58:57.300]  has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a
[01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:02.260]  practice now banned in nations around the world guess what else is in the
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:07.300]  halogen family fluoride ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:11.580]  federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[01:59:11.580 --> 01:59:16.940]  iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on
[01:59:16.940 --> 01:59:22.180]  record reports documented a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:28.060]  been deficient in iodine bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a
[01:59:28.060 --> 01:59:32.900]  glycerin base nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family you

[01:59:53.060 --> 02:00:00.620]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:12.500]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.500 --> 02:00:20.020]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:20.020 --> 02:00:25.780]  Alex Jones Merck vaccine scientist Dr. Maurice Hellman who worked with Dr.
[02:00:25.780 --> 02:00:28.860]  Socklin Holio vaccine there's video of it we've played it for a decade here
[02:00:28.860 --> 02:00:35.340]  admitted presence of sp-40 AIDS and cancer viruses in vaccines at the 2011
[02:00:35.340 --> 02:00:39.940]  article from natural news dot com we have it mirrored up an info wars dot com I
[02:00:39.940 --> 02:00:43.380]  want to get in the short five-minute segment give Dr. Sherry ten penny of
[02:00:43.380 --> 02:00:49.580]  ten penny IMC com some time to talk about what she just said about smallpox
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:53.500]  and polio not really being stopped by the vaccine there's mountains of
[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:57.820]  evidence she's a medical doctor talk about that well you summed it up right
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:01:01.420]  there Alex when you said there's mountains of evidence there's mountains
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:06.140]  of evidence that the polio epidemic or the peak of the polio outbreak I guess
[02:01:06.140 --> 02:01:09.660]  we should call it here in the US was on its way out before either the salt or
[02:01:09.660 --> 02:01:13.460]  the saven vaccine was introduced polio went away in other countries just by
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:17.900]  sanitation not by vaccination and it's estimated that less than 10% of the
[02:01:17.900 --> 02:01:22.500]  entire global population was vaccinated with the smallpox vaccine and it went
[02:01:22.500 --> 02:01:26.700]  to went away by hygiene and refrigeration and I think that when we
[02:01:26.700 --> 02:01:31.180]  talk about the hygiene hypothesis and how so many of these infectious diseases
[02:01:31.180 --> 02:01:35.940]  went away because of hygiene I think equally important maybe even more
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:40.300]  important than hygiene was refrigeration where we could keep our food
[02:01:40.300 --> 02:01:44.420]  fresher and that we didn't have to eat moldy things and and that we were able
[02:01:44.420 --> 02:01:50.740]  to actually refrigerate our how I mean air condition our house so that we had
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:55.860]  more comfortable living spaces so I think that hygiene and refrigeration are
[02:01:55.860 --> 02:02:00.980]  really important the polio vaccine was just put up as this huge big savior of
[02:02:00.980 --> 02:02:04.860]  the world and the same thing with the smallpox vaccine and smallpox never
[02:02:04.860 --> 02:02:08.260]  even really went away it just morphed into another type of pox virus called
[02:02:08.260 --> 02:02:12.220]  monkey pox and we see outbreaks of it periodically in Africa but we can't call
[02:02:12.220 --> 02:02:16.460]  it anything related to smallpox because of course the smallpox vaccine saved the
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:20.820]  world by a radical I was about to say look at how the so-called polio vaccine
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:24.140]  they're giving around the world is actually causing paralysis they don't
[02:02:24.140 --> 02:02:27.980]  call it polio they call it paralysis yeah because isn't that what we are
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:32.500]  actually trying to do by eliminate the polio virus which we make the assumption
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:37.020]  that these polio viruses which are gastrointestinal viruses actually can
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.940]  get into the the bloodstream and go into the neurological system and cause
[02:02:39.940 --> 02:02:44.260]  paralysis there are actually several other families of viruses that can cause
[02:02:44.260 --> 02:02:48.700]  paralysis but because we don't have a vaccine for those families of viruses
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:53.220]  like coxsackie viruses and things like that we don't even talk about that and
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:56.660]  it just so happens Bill Gates everybody said they want to reduce population by
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:04.340]  80% so let's have him give kids shots yeah have him give kids shots or set up
[02:03:04.340 --> 02:03:07.380]  the mechanisms to deliver them now they're actually talking about I just saw
[02:03:07.380 --> 02:03:11.340]  that's what I meant is he's funding the mass force inoculation yeah I just saw
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:14.660]  a report you know how they're talking now about all these drones and like with
[02:03:14.660 --> 02:03:19.620]  Amazon delivering boxes I just saw some kids at some university that just got
[02:03:19.620 --> 02:03:23.420]  funded by the Gates Foundation to develop a drone to develop to deliver
[02:03:23.420 --> 02:03:27.700]  vaccines to locations where they can't get into with with a World Health
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:31.900]  Organization workers that is huge we're going to carry that at info wars calm
[02:03:31.900 --> 02:03:36.020]  yeah Gates is trying to have all the vaccines in the food now where you can't
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:40.820]  get away from it they're called edible vaccines they have them the hepatitis B
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:44.780]  vaccine they've been working on that one for a while to introduce that into
[02:03:44.780 --> 02:03:50.060]  Africa in carrots and in potatoes Gates has been working for a while at this
[02:03:50.060 --> 02:03:54.420]  whole concept of a malaria vaccine with mosquitoes delivering by mosquitoes no
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:03:57.940]  what if you get bit 10 times does that mean you get 10 doses of the vaccine I
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:04:02.300]  mean it's just insanity I think about these pictures you know sometimes you
[02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:05.860]  have seen those pictures and the old days of Albert Einstein with the gray
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:09.940]  hair that's all messed up across his head they just looks like this wild wild
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:15.500]  scientist and I think that there's this issue with technology that because we

[02:10:05.300 --> 02:10:10.420]  very hard most people I know that even aware of this stuff have been sucked
[02:10:10.420 --> 02:10:14.420]  into the iPhones the droids entertainment and can't take the enemy serious
[02:10:14.420 --> 02:10:19.020]  even though they don't like the New World Order because they're still now had
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:24.460]  their brainwaves meshed with the flicker rate we've lost them other people are
[02:10:24.460 --> 02:10:28.540]  bought into other layers of propaganda the whole hype driven system of the whole
[02:10:28.540 --> 02:10:33.180]  you know Hollywood music scene which which which people imprint on like baby
[02:10:33.180 --> 02:10:39.220]  ducks you know to their mama and we'll just be programmed by and we'll follow
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:44.580]  the commands as long as it's associated with that and then there's the chemical
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:48.100]  the biological the radiological the electromagnetic manipulation I'm gonna

[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:57.580]  that's going on I want to get your take on that I want to get your take on I
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:03.460]  told you this years ago five six years ago with Jim Tucker when Jim Tucker died
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:12.940]  last June weeks before the Bilderberg summit we lost some of our best contacts
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:18.460]  the fellow was working with him the editor still has some of them but Jim was
[02:11:18.460 --> 02:11:21.820]  unable to transfer one of the contacts because I mean so much of what he said
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:26.780]  which is so dead on Bush in six months will endorse carbon taxes and global
[02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:32.660]  warming that was nowhere people and then he did it in two years they will
[02:11:32.660 --> 02:11:37.660]  implode the housing bubble and use that to bring in a bailout that's really a
[02:11:37.660 --> 02:11:43.100]  takeover of the entire domestic system and the global crisis will be used they
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:49.340]  want to impoverish the whole thing happened but I remember Tucker saying
[02:11:49.340 --> 02:11:56.820]  they're going to manufacture Jeep and and all the Chrysler products in Italy and
[02:11:56.820 --> 02:12:00.380]  the Fiat head was at Bilderberg and they made the deal there that within the next
[02:12:00.380 --> 02:12:05.340]  five years I guess it's been five years they would transfer Chrysler there they
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:11.300]  began transferring it officially two years ago and I would cover it and they
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:15.460]  would have news about oh maybe they won't to make opposition not build you see
[02:12:15.460 --> 02:12:19.100]  how that works today bring Obamacare in it double shriples your prices makes you
[02:12:19.100 --> 02:12:22.580]  buy it cuts the quality care and they go oh maybe we're gonna take that off and
[02:12:22.580 --> 02:12:26.300]  then it doesn't get taken off and it's like Obama you said you do that be a
[02:12:26.300 --> 02:12:31.100]  dictator you're like okay be a dictator and he's like well even though I'm a
[02:12:31.100 --> 02:12:35.660]  dictator I can't and then it's his bill and they're like well racist white
[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:39.780]  people and they're the reason when Obamacare isn't working that's in the
[02:12:39.780 --> 02:12:43.580]  news today and you're like what's that to do with reality it's mind control and
[02:12:43.580 --> 02:12:47.060]  these people that have joined the new world order they're all trying to
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:51.420]  compete and show how evil they are so they can be the ones that don't get the
[02:12:51.420 --> 02:12:55.780]  deadly vaccines so they can get the non GMO food that's in mainstream news
[02:12:55.780 --> 02:13:01.700]  that Monsanto laboratories GMO laboratories in 99 it broke in the
[02:13:01.700 --> 02:13:07.500]  CBC and it broke again last year 2013 nothing is there but organic and
[02:13:07.500 --> 02:13:11.860]  totally purified water well they know about glyphosate in the tap water in
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:19.540]  the well water from round up they know about they know about all the poison
[02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:23.020]  they know about what the GMO stacked and what's really meant to do what they
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:26.020]  add into those things they know it sterilizes and kills all the rodents
[02:13:26.020 --> 02:13:31.740]  within three generations they know of course those scientists don't eat that
[02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:38.940]  of course they don't they never will it came out that the entire German
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:43.980]  government gets special vaccines advanced nano tech type vaccines and the
[02:13:43.980 --> 02:13:49.660]  military revolted and said we want those too because we gave the military the
[02:13:49.660 --> 02:13:53.620]  intel I mean listen folks you ignore this information at your barrel that
[02:13:53.620 --> 02:13:57.380]  you're living in a science fiction nightmare okay only by admitting it can
[02:13:57.380 --> 02:14:00.380]  we turn the tide against it not admitting it is what is allowing it to
[02:14:00.380 --> 02:14:04.420]  happen I mean that's why if I'm not speeding or something and some cop
[02:14:04.420 --> 02:14:10.980]  follows me and pulls me over because they've license plate read my tags or
[02:14:10.980 --> 02:14:13.780]  whatever and wants to come over and harass me because of who I am and wants
[02:14:13.780 --> 02:14:17.780]  to search the car I just heard laughing at them I just go you know what future
[02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:23.300]  do you think you have under this system where you play the part of the guardian
[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:28.380]  or if you know my employees get threatening phone calls or followed to
[02:14:28.380 --> 02:14:33.980]  work or lasers pointed at them you know through their window at night what type
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:37.500]  of contractors and people I mean you really think crapping in your own nest
[02:14:37.500 --> 02:14:44.500]  you really think being evil is fun and cool you really think that you're on
[02:14:44.500 --> 02:14:48.940]  the good guy team I mean is that some kind of sick joke
[02:14:50.620 --> 02:14:55.500]  you've opened the doors to hell you took the jobs with the system because you
[02:14:55.500 --> 02:14:58.220]  felt like you were powerful and you wanted money and now you're deep into
[02:14:58.220 --> 02:15:01.020]  it you don't want to admit you're part of something destructive and that goes
[02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:04.860]  for the corporate henchmen that goes for the hatchet men and women that goes
[02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:08.180]  for the propagandist that goes for the White House that goes for all of you
[02:15:08.180 --> 02:15:11.620]  you know there's a reason presidents look really freaked out unhealthy once
[02:15:11.620 --> 02:15:16.220]  they get in there there's a reason all these top corporate leaders are so evil
[02:15:16.220 --> 02:15:19.900]  looking and so weird and get caught doing all this weird stuff because man
[02:15:19.900 --> 02:15:28.620]  evil is not fun the church tells you want to have a good time and you know
[02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:32.180]  loving the opposite sex is the big center drinking a beer meanwhile they
[02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:35.980]  don't talk about Dinecore with child kidnapping rings or cancer viruses and
[02:15:35.980 --> 02:15:39.940]  the vaccines you know they sit there and tell you how you know you're guilty and
[02:15:39.940 --> 02:15:42.980]  you're bad and beat you over the head with the Bible so you'll feel guilty and
[02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:48.580]  give them money and so they can be the moral authority and do what the
[02:15:48.580 --> 02:15:52.540]  government says render under Caesar out of context take your shots do what's
[02:15:52.540 --> 02:15:57.220]  expected to you not telling you they're actually an FBI informant being paid
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:02.460]  cash money under faith-based initiative to literally in their counseling
[02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:07.940]  programs all of it sit there and not just spy on you but they use those
[02:16:07.940 --> 02:16:11.940]  counseling services at the big mega churches to put fake info in your FBI
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:16.620]  file to then open fraudulent investigations just like I told you the
[02:16:16.620 --> 02:16:22.580]  DEA uses the NSA systems to create fake cases and put people in jail that came
[02:16:22.580 --> 02:16:27.500]  out two months ago years after I told you because I have sources in the DEA the
[02:16:27.500 --> 02:16:32.700]  FBI the NSA all of them and by the way I don't have a lot of those sources now
[02:16:32.700 --> 02:16:38.700]  because the chilling effect of the NSA but even back then these people all knew
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:43.420]  what was going on and gave me stuff in parking lots whenever I would do public
[02:16:43.420 --> 02:16:47.780]  events or would give it to my people in parking lots I mean I can't believe in
[02:16:47.780 --> 02:16:51.060]  the amount of stuff I threw in the trash can because I couldn't even
[02:16:51.060 --> 02:16:58.980]  understand what it all was all of it okay I'm telling you folks and some of
[02:16:58.980 --> 02:17:03.260]  these people that gave me stuff were really scary-looking people not the kind
[02:17:03.260 --> 02:17:07.580]  of feds you see on television and a lot of these people admitted that they done
[02:17:07.580 --> 02:17:10.740]  bad things that they weren't even good people but that this was too much what
[02:17:10.740 --> 02:17:16.980]  was being planned I mean folks you are literally opening the gates to hell when
[02:17:16.980 --> 02:17:27.860]  you go along with this 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 is the toll-free number I
[02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:32.020]  want to hear from you the great Italian auto bailout courtesy of US taxpayers
[02:17:32.020 --> 02:17:39.340]  fee ought to buy full control of Chrysler with bailout money CNN billionaires
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:45.020]  were 3.7 trillion surge as Gates wins 2013 that's Bloomberg I thought Bill
[02:17:45.020 --> 02:17:49.340]  Gates gave all his money away no no no he's his money is now tax exempt just
[02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:55.020]  like the NFL he keeps the money he just puts some of it into extermination
[02:17:55.020 --> 02:17:58.740]  programs here because Christians have stopped him from it so he has to get his
[02:17:58.740 --> 02:18:05.300]  own money not taxpayer money here it is billionaires were 3.7 trillion surge as
[02:18:05.300 --> 02:18:14.860]  Gates wins 2013 that's just some of the news on that front and again I mentioned
[02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:18.660]  this earlier but as 52 passengers have been rescued today from the ship trapped
[02:18:18.660 --> 02:18:25.260]  in the Arctic ice on a expedition 98% of news articles have a news busters a
[02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:32.900]  story here on a freeze out of the news 98% of the news media refused in a study
[02:18:32.900 --> 02:18:37.740]  to say it was a global warming expedition just like they've now said

[02:24:43.500 --> 02:24:50.220]  calling sir hey Alex can you hear me okay I sure can all right it's great to
[02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:56.020]  talk to you hey I wanted to you know you you really do a good job of kind of
[02:24:56.020 --> 02:25:00.740]  summarizing oftentimes what all the different sort of vectors that they
[02:25:00.740 --> 02:25:06.300]  have on zombifying people and I wanted to encourage you I know you do cover
[02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:11.500]  this but I wanted to encourage you to kind of include the electromagnetic
[02:25:11.500 --> 02:25:16.340]  radiation that we're all being subjected to you know well you know Dr.
[02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:20.500]  baggage says that's even bigger than all the chemical and biological with all
[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:24.020]  the hundreds actually thousands of patents since the 50s and that that's
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:29.060]  where the real mind control is I agree I agree completely with that because you
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:32.740]  know what it is is that and you had a great segment this was I don't know a
[02:25:32.740 --> 02:25:36.900]  couple months ago about you knew when you were you had gone for a run and you
[02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:41.020]  said you know with the secret place of the most high and then you in the same
[02:25:41.020 --> 02:25:44.820]  segment you said something about electromagnetic gulag but I thought it
[02:25:44.820 --> 02:25:48.060]  was very no no that's it and you notice they want to make us take a vaccine that
[02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:51.940]  literally eats that part of the brain that's the receiver for that they know
[02:25:51.940 --> 02:25:56.460]  that I mean think about it they want to kill our free will and our connection to
[02:25:56.460 --> 02:26:03.060]  the creator yes these are soul sucking vampires and the thing is that the
[02:26:03.060 --> 02:26:08.940]  electromagnetic radiation directly affects our ability our most important
[02:26:08.940 --> 02:26:15.500]  ability are you know our brains ability to no fluoride hits the pineal higher
[02:26:15.500 --> 02:26:20.900]  level hundred percent they do not want us this is what they believe it's what
[02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:24.300]  the science shows that you feel somebody looking at you you know in a room you
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:27.460]  didn't know was there because they're staring at you there's an electromagnetic
[02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:31.300]  projection this has been scientifically proven in studies where just
[02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:35.940]  observation changes the event it's been proven 100% in literally thousands of
[02:26:35.940 --> 02:26:40.180]  studies the globalist believes that those of us that aren't with them until
[02:26:40.180 --> 02:26:45.180]  we're dead or until we're spiritually neutralized we're broadcasting on a
[02:26:45.180 --> 02:26:49.940]  wavelength that keeps them from taking over do you understand that's why they
[02:26:49.940 --> 02:26:54.820]  want to literally destroy our soul cut our brain off from the creator I mean
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:59.620]  this is a science fiction movie we're in it is it doesn't matter it is a spiritual
[02:26:59.620 --> 02:27:04.500]  battle and our brains are you know our physical weapon that is our greatest
[02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:09.780]  physical weapon that's it and we have to be aware of that with the fluoride and
[02:27:09.780 --> 02:27:14.580]  the statins and in the GMO and now the vaccines had a medical doctor on this is
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:18.740]  mainline science they're giving trip shots or daddy doesn't get mad daddy
[02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:24.500]  doesn't get sad daddy is now a robot daddy literally does not have any high
[02:27:24.500 --> 02:27:29.060]  emotions and has a glaze on his face and that's what you're already this are

[02:28:22.740 --> 02:28:30.500]  air yes sir just had two point one with the the flow out in the water that to
[02:28:30.500 --> 02:28:35.740]  me is one of the biggest issues tried to wake up family and friends that most
[02:28:35.740 --> 02:28:40.700]  of them really don't understand that that is a just an awful poison added to
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:45.100]  our water supply and the reason they don't understand it is because it's
[02:28:45.100 --> 02:28:50.900]  worked I mean they're dumbed down I tried my hardest to wake up family
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:54.900]  showing them the study showing your research they're gone already it's just
[02:28:54.900 --> 02:28:58.660]  like a person that's brain dead on a respirator they're just gone they're
[02:28:58.660 --> 02:29:03.660]  dead so what one of those of us that had that had that were resistant or

[02:29:20.300 --> 02:29:25.900]  dumbing us down and controlling us via the TV the vaccine the fluoride and
[02:29:25.900 --> 02:29:31.580]  most people just can't seem to understand it and that is to understand
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:35.380]  why they stay there I'm gonna come back to you and give you the answer because
[02:29:35.380 --> 02:29:38.300]  actually leads into what I was gonna say don't hang up I'm gonna come back to you

[02:33:35.380 --> 02:33:40.900]  about really what's at the heart of all this a key area there's a lot of things
[02:33:40.900 --> 02:33:44.860]  at the heart of it like a pie the different slices but it's it's a key
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:48.260]  point I don't make enough dealing with people that are actually somewhat awake
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:52.860]  but have decided to do nothing I'm gonna talk about that briefly in a moment
[02:33:52.860 --> 02:33:57.500]  speaking of doing nothing there's radioactive waves now coming in that
[02:33:57.500 --> 02:34:01.820]  took two years to go across the specific with giant pieces of debris according
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:05.540]  to Fox News Associated Press they're just down the next few weeks starting to
[02:34:05.540 --> 02:34:12.380]  slam into the west coast from Mexico all the way up to Alaska they will not tell
[02:34:12.380 --> 02:34:20.700]  you that you need high-quality thyroid iodine truly atomic iodine to go in
[02:34:20.700 --> 02:34:25.340]  there and block it and help your other glands as well they will not tell you
[02:34:25.340 --> 02:34:29.380]  that there are other things that you can do as well they will not tell you that
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:33.780]  fluoride fills up the thyroid and bromine and other bad members of the
[02:34:33.780 --> 02:34:36.900]  halogen if you don't have the good member of the halogen they won't tell you
[02:34:36.900 --> 02:34:41.580]  that the regular thyroid pills out there are bound and are not nascent and
[02:34:41.580 --> 02:34:45.660]  truly atomic well we have it survival shield it's almost sold out right now
[02:34:45.660 --> 02:34:49.100]  but we've got more coming in two weeks so in a few days if we keep selling like
[02:34:49.100 --> 02:34:53.020]  this it'll be on back order for a few weeks but survival shield nascent iodine

[02:35:19.540 --> 02:35:24.340]  fluoride shield that has five other I asked dr. group I said how can we make
[02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:27.820]  this even better because I would add these five other ingredients like
[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:31.540]  chelogy and other things that are known to supercharge the nascent iodine and
[02:35:31.540 --> 02:35:35.620]  detox the fluoride not just the radioactive isotopes and so much more
[02:35:35.620 --> 02:35:38.900]  heavy metals you name it see the breakdown video and the write-ups at
[02:35:38.900 --> 02:35:43.700]  infowarslife.com and it's two ounce not one ounce like the survival shield and
[02:35:43.700 --> 02:35:47.500]  it has the fluoride shield has the nascent iodine in it as well just not at
[02:35:47.500 --> 02:35:50.900]  the same level and by the way in four plus months of taking this I've built up
[02:35:50.900 --> 02:35:54.300]  to taking more consult your physician take the recommended amount obviously
[02:35:54.300 --> 02:35:59.100]  but dr. group told me some stuff basically about it depends on the person
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:04.940]  but you've heard the rave reviews and mine are just good good good we'll say
[02:36:04.940 --> 02:36:08.860]  how could you say iodine doesn't taste bad that's because it's bound iodine
[02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:14.100]  that turns black on paper folks this turns blue purple this is real nascent
[02:36:14.100 --> 02:36:18.700]  iodine believe me we'll look for other manufacturers we tested the labs it
[02:36:18.700 --> 02:36:23.900]  wasn't nascent iodine it wasn't nascent iodine it was just a regular loogles or
[02:36:23.900 --> 02:36:26.780]  whatever you call it that's been around for over a hundred years which is
[02:36:26.780 --> 02:36:29.620]  better than nothing that stuff's good from when I've talked to a medical
[02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:33.460]  doctors they say that's good on the skin is the way to take that not in a glass
[02:36:33.460 --> 02:36:37.140]  of water drinking it they said I can go after your guts but look each person's

[02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:21.420]  why don't people care about each other why can't they reach out to other people
[02:38:21.420 --> 02:38:25.860]  why don't they care a they feel powerless be they've been brought up as
[02:38:25.860 --> 02:38:30.140]  spectators and they've been mesmerized by the television wavelength on record to
[02:38:30.140 --> 02:38:34.820]  be in a near sleep state of being hypnotized or sleepwalking literally
[02:38:34.820 --> 02:38:41.900]  that's how top hypnotist on record say that it's much easier in fact some of
[02:38:41.900 --> 02:38:45.260]  the famous ones I've been meaning to get on her 60 70 years old say it's much
[02:38:45.260 --> 02:38:48.820]  easier to hypnotize people nowadays because people are such spectators and
[02:38:48.820 --> 02:38:54.020]  watch television they know they have famous hypnotist with police watching
[02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:56.620]  it's not rigged because they have to be there to make sure nothing happens I
[02:38:56.620 --> 02:39:00.660]  agree with it go and believe they're gonna murder somebody with a gun they
[02:39:00.660 --> 02:39:06.460]  believes real that doesn't have bullets I mean that's how suggestible people are
[02:39:06.460 --> 02:39:10.780]  just with because they're already hypnotized that's why they've already
[02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:15.260]  been hypnotized then you add fluoride to chemicals now vaccines that literally
[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:19.980]  eat the spiritual center of your brain that's mainline literature they go oh
[02:39:19.980 --> 02:39:23.900]  this is the area about excitement and and a high emotions and then that very
[02:39:23.900 --> 02:39:27.460]  area of the brain when you read in the patents that's the spiritual center
[02:39:27.460 --> 02:39:33.260]  that's the high IQ area that's the brainstorm area that's the epiphany area
[02:39:33.260 --> 02:39:36.500]  that those of us that are already somewhat intelligent if we're exercising
[02:39:36.500 --> 02:39:39.740]  suddenly have those epiphany because there's more blood hitting it more
[02:39:39.740 --> 02:39:44.100]  endorphins interacting with it and it's like whoa your processor is working
[02:39:44.100 --> 02:39:48.460]  right they tell them what stick his head and freezing ice a lot of top chess
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:52.300]  players you know hop around or do you know jump rope and stuff 20 minutes
[02:39:52.300 --> 02:39:55.420]  before they go in and get you get that blood going because they're trying to
[02:39:55.420 --> 02:40:00.140]  really flood just like your muscles get pumped when you exercise the brain gets
[02:40:00.140 --> 02:40:08.420]  pumped and it's that high you get they want to annihilate that because that's
[02:40:08.420 --> 02:40:14.340]  the high that will see evil and resistant you understand that folks so
[02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:19.740]  that's why so many yuppies and trendies people that work for the system they
[02:40:19.740 --> 02:40:23.180]  feel insecure inside and some of them are not hypnotized they actually know
[02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:26.900]  what's going on they're very scared I've talked to top scientists doctors lawyers
[02:40:26.900 --> 02:40:32.180]  judges high-level members of the state legislature members of Congress high
[02:40:32.180 --> 02:40:35.820]  level off record and they go look we know exactly what you're saying is true
[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:40.460]  and more you have no idea the technology 30 years advanced we're
[02:40:40.460 --> 02:40:45.540]  basically prisoners we're praying to Jesus a secret service people break down
[02:40:45.540 --> 02:40:49.820]  crying what they've seen in the White House I mean we are literally overrun
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:56.020]  by demons okay that's all I can say and every moment of my life's like a
[02:40:56.020 --> 02:41:01.580]  Twilight Zone episode and the but but many of these yuppies who who aren't
[02:41:01.580 --> 02:41:04.260]  really good people but they're not really evil people they just go you're not
[02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:07.860]  gonna stop it there's nothing you can do anyways and you're just gonna bring it
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:12.620]  down faster fighting it you know if you expose the government if you expose
[02:41:12.620 --> 02:41:16.420]  false flags I'm connected to it and we're not all bad that'll bring it all
[02:41:16.420 --> 02:41:20.020]  down it'll discredit everyone no this thing coming to fruition we'll
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:25.580]  discredit everything I mean years ago we talked about fractional reserve banking
[02:41:25.580 --> 02:41:28.300]  and all this and say they better quit doing the derivatives it'll be value
[02:41:28.300 --> 02:41:31.460]  the dollar and I'd get threatening emails and calls and people going you're
[02:41:31.460 --> 02:41:34.740]  the one that's gonna cause a loss of confidence they'll bring it down know
[02:41:34.740 --> 02:41:41.780]  the bubble of many stocks a hundred times their price earnings ratio they've
[02:41:41.780 --> 02:41:47.020]  had 20 30 times in the Great Depression and the lead up to 1929 I mean this is
[02:41:47.020 --> 02:41:51.340]  guaranteed jumping off a hundred story building without a parachute you're
[02:41:51.340 --> 02:41:57.580]  going to die when you hit the bottom you're like no you're just being negative
[02:41:57.580 --> 02:42:00.980]  saying if we jump off here we'll die because we've already been thrown off
[02:42:00.980 --> 02:42:06.460]  the building that's the issue but we're but a politics in a society is not one
[02:42:06.460 --> 02:42:11.100]  person we've already hit the bottom and have splattered but we're an idea
[02:42:11.100 --> 02:42:14.740]  humans regenerate themselves we're a renewable resource according to the
[02:42:14.740 --> 02:42:21.300]  globalist but we are renewable and so like a phoenix we can rise that's that's
[02:42:21.300 --> 02:42:25.940]  the issue is that it's an idea it's bulletproof so we've already hit the
[02:42:25.940 --> 02:42:30.300]  bottom and there's brains everywhere and got sprayed out never seen a photo
[02:42:30.300 --> 02:42:34.140]  somebody that falls off a tall building I mean it's a big splatter 30 feet
[02:42:34.140 --> 02:42:39.540]  around like a strawberry that got stepped on and you've got to admit we're on the
[02:42:39.540 --> 02:42:45.740]  ground if we can be resurrected and that's why they want to target the
[02:42:45.740 --> 02:42:51.980]  ganglia in the cerebral cortex but also deeper inside the brain to shut down
[02:42:51.980 --> 02:42:59.620]  those uplifting moments of higher consciousness they don't want you to
[02:42:59.620 --> 02:43:05.620]  have high consciousness because in that place you then see that selling out to
[02:43:05.620 --> 02:43:09.180]  evil is not good you then see their designs you're now wearing the sunglasses
[02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:12.940]  like they live in the one whoa your monsters whoa this is really bad idea
[02:43:12.940 --> 02:43:18.180]  not the great idea you said it was suddenly you see the world for what it
[02:43:18.180 --> 02:43:22.500]  really is I had an experience like that when I was about 11 years old at a
[02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:32.020]  water park no hallucinogens no drugs no nothing and for about two minutes
[02:43:32.020 --> 02:43:36.100]  watching all these people it was like it was a vision from heaven folks the
[02:43:36.100 --> 02:43:39.860]  media can go crazy with us I don't even care anymore and I literally could see
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:44.260]  people for what is incredible I'm just gonna leave it at that and I'm telling
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:47.980]  you folks there's a lot of stuff going on out there and that's why some people
[02:43:47.980 --> 02:43:52.140]  we think are crazy are actually just super sensitive and totally flipped out
[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:56.540]  by what they see or there's toxins in the environment that cause these effects
[02:43:56.540 --> 02:44:00.500]  on the brain but we're so much more advanced I mean they always said 96% of
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:04.220]  DNA was junk they knew decades ago it wasn't folks they've been attacking that
[02:44:04.220 --> 02:44:08.260]  real DNA that even if they mutated us and hurt us it folds back out and
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:13.700]  produces a whole new strand basically to defeat the enemy I mean we are
[02:44:13.700 --> 02:44:17.260]  incredible folks and believe me we didn't just come together with some sand
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:21.100]  in the desert flying together and you know and then and then a tadpole was
[02:44:21.100 --> 02:44:26.300]  created and then it turned into a man who built spaceships and Lubin von Beethoven
[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:33.300]  but I'm telling you folks if you ever ever just see these people for what they
[02:44:33.300 --> 02:44:39.060]  are it's gonna blow your mind it and it's they live at a spiritual level
[02:44:39.060 --> 02:44:43.500]  alright Kent does that answer your question want to make any other points
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:50.860]  oh it's great yeah I would like to add to it for just a 50 second if you don't
[02:44:50.860 --> 02:45:00.180]  mind yeah just in the whole awakening you know personally studying the New
[02:45:00.180 --> 02:45:04.900]  World Order stuff that I'd heard as a child and just all was put in the back
[02:45:04.900 --> 02:45:10.340]  of my subconscious and then just manifested itself and now I see
[02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:18.180]  everything and the epitome of the awakening is the spiritual battle knowing
[02:45:18.180 --> 02:45:22.820]  the enemy trying to wake up family and friends you know to the one-world
[02:45:22.820 --> 02:45:28.140]  government why they're poison this just about all of it and that is just the
[02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:34.300]  greatest thing ever is to join the fight to wake up turn that TV off read your
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:40.300]  Bible I mean just you know go all in like he said you're all in and we are
[02:45:40.300 --> 02:45:44.020]  too and it's just the greatest the greatest thing ever well it you know
[02:45:44.020 --> 02:45:48.460]  it's come to me the last few years when I'm really thinking clearly that just the
[02:45:48.460 --> 02:45:53.500]  word enemy as the Bible says it and and every other culture has said it what
[02:45:53.500 --> 02:45:59.020]  that encompasses knowing the enemy is everything knowing the enemy then you
[02:45:59.020 --> 02:46:02.700]  will know they're an enemy and must be defeated knowing is more than half the
[02:46:02.700 --> 02:46:07.340]  battle knowing is the battle because if you know it's an enemy and you know
[02:46:07.340 --> 02:46:11.980]  they're not giving you quarter then you know what you've got to do someone who
[02:46:11.980 --> 02:46:16.060]  hates another someone who attacks or tries to harm another Webster says a
[02:46:16.060 --> 02:46:19.340]  group of people such as a nation against whom another group is fighting a war
[02:46:19.340 --> 02:46:23.740]  one that is antagonistic to another especially one seeking to injure
[02:46:23.740 --> 02:46:27.300]  overthrow or confound an opponent that's what they're doing to us kill steal
[02:46:27.300 --> 02:46:33.980]  destroy someone harmful or deadly a military adversary a hostile unit or
[02:46:33.980 --> 02:46:38.660]  force but this isn't some enemy that just wants to conquer us physically who
[02:46:38.660 --> 02:46:42.540]  wants more living space or more resources or who believes their culture is
[02:46:42.540 --> 02:46:45.940]  better and wants to build us up there's been cases where enemy takes over and
[02:46:45.940 --> 02:46:49.740]  it's better where an enemy comes in and you had a worse group running you so
[02:46:49.740 --> 02:46:54.340]  it's a liberating enemy that is this is not a liberating enemy this is an enemy
[02:46:54.340 --> 02:47:01.780]  I mean my very DNA my very spirit says enemy just total enemy total enemy total
[02:47:01.780 --> 02:47:06.980]  enemy I don't know how else to explain it they are the enemy they're coming after
[02:47:06.980 --> 02:47:12.780]  our children our health everything they are the enemy and I don't say that with
[02:47:12.780 --> 02:47:18.980]  hatred I say it as a realization that this is an enemy that's all I could say
[02:47:18.980 --> 02:47:22.780]  and people better realize that there's no choosing aside here this is an enemy of
[02:47:22.780 --> 02:47:29.020]  humanity an enemy of life you don't make a deal with this devil fools that
[02:47:29.020 --> 02:47:35.880]  believe they can I appreciate your call God bless you
[02:47:35.880 --> 02:47:41.340]  Amber you're on the air calling from planet Earth go ahead like happy new
[02:47:41.340 --> 02:47:46.140]  year and God bless you and the crew pray for you every day I had an
[02:47:46.140 --> 02:47:51.740]  observation that relates to the sort of zombified public it if you recall the
[02:47:51.740 --> 02:47:58.220]  old Rod Taylor time machine film he is a way into the future and the people are
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:04.180]  so apathetic that very lovely young lady actress Yvette Mimia is drowning
[02:48:04.180 --> 02:48:10.060]  and they're all just sort of sitting around twiddling their thumbs the time
[02:48:10.060 --> 02:48:15.540]  machine the old time machine oh yeah I've seen that with with HT Wells the
[02:48:15.540 --> 02:48:22.740]  one yes yes that Rod Taylor plays your character in it and he you know jumps in
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:27.100]  to save the young lady and later she actually ends up saving him from the
[02:48:27.100 --> 02:48:32.060]  moorlocks but she asked him why did you save me and he's asking them all sorts
[02:48:32.060 --> 02:48:36.780]  of questions about like well how do you live how is your society constructed and
[02:48:36.780 --> 02:48:40.300]  actually they're just right I saw when I was a kid I want to see it again and
[02:48:40.300 --> 02:48:43.420]  they're like why do you ask how society is constructed see that's the key
[02:48:43.420 --> 02:48:48.260]  thinking about civil civilizational level things thinking about where the
[02:48:48.260 --> 02:48:52.300]  power lines go where's the meat come from that's like weird to these fools
[02:48:52.300 --> 02:48:56.460]  they don't get that's what it is to be a leader to be successful even
[02:48:56.460 --> 02:49:01.340]  monetarily they're too lazy to know how things even work I talked to people and
[02:49:01.340 --> 02:49:05.940]  they have no idea how anything works they just think this is all some playground
[02:49:05.940 --> 02:49:11.740]  they're living in it's not it's a weaponized kill grid yes yes and I was
[02:49:11.740 --> 02:49:16.620]  just so struck by that film in thinking of what happened with John Bowne the
[02:49:16.620 --> 02:49:20.820]  other day and with you in the restaurant and actually every day you are in this
[02:49:20.820 --> 02:49:26.580]  fight a heroic fight and I commend the chivalry bravery decency and common sense
[02:49:26.580 --> 02:49:30.820]  of all of you and your crew you are gentlemen and ladies and we've been
[02:49:30.820 --> 02:49:34.620]  trained to think that those terms are sort of antiquated or irrelevant but
[02:49:34.620 --> 02:49:39.540]  they actually encapsulate the respect that all of us have learned through ages
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:44.180]  for our fellow man and I thank and commend you God bless you well God bless
[02:49:44.180 --> 02:49:49.060]  you and listen I appreciate your compliments but I personally was trying
[02:49:49.060 --> 02:49:53.540]  to survive but but you're right in an age of cowards just being normal is
[02:49:53.540 --> 02:49:57.740]  heroic but but I think you just quantified it all we have respect for
[02:49:57.740 --> 02:50:03.500]  fellow humans and respect for life and empathy and they've removed the empathy
[02:50:03.500 --> 02:50:07.700]  and they've removed the humanity and it's draining out right now and they're
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:13.220]  waging war on empathy and turning common sense on its head for the horrors they
[02:50:13.220 --> 02:50:19.020]  have to come and we've got to resist it any other points yes actually I've had a
[02:50:19.020 --> 02:50:23.540]  bit of success with fluoride education for people who are just ready to think
[02:50:23.540 --> 02:50:28.140]  oh I must love fluoride or my teeth will look rotten a good place I've found to
[02:50:28.140 --> 02:50:32.660]  start is that they'll be familiar with topical application of fluoride being
[02:50:32.660 --> 02:50:37.640]  something beneficial that's questionable as well but I do start there and I say
[02:50:37.640 --> 02:50:41.380]  okay let's say that a topical application is beneficial you've seen
[02:50:41.380 --> 02:50:44.460]  nail hardener right there a couple companies say what stay there come back
[02:50:44.460 --> 02:50:47.220]  and tell me how you wake people up I just give them the Harvard study it lowers
[02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:52.020]  IQ 10 points and children at least every decade you take it 10 to 10 IQ points
[02:50:52.020 --> 02:50:56.060]  is like getting 50 treatments of electroshock folks you might as well beat
[02:50:56.060 --> 02:50:59.260]  your kids and hammers but see me do that the CPS would take them and rightfully
[02:50:59.260 --> 02:51:03.220]  solve it deal with chemicals it's okay hi my name is Annette and due to menopause
[02:51:03.220 --> 02:51:07.980]  symptoms for nearly two years I suffered severe hot flashes which prevented me
[02:51:07.980 --> 02:51:12.380]  from sleeping all night it was so hard to work because it continued all day to
[02:51:12.380 --> 02:51:17.180]  have the hot flashes from hell I was exhausted and depleted after only three
[02:51:17.180 --> 02:51:21.340]  weeks on one roadway I have no hot flashes and I'm sleeping normally again
[02:51:21.340 --> 02:51:26.180]  I feel energized and strong this is an amazing product it is a little known
[02:51:26.180 --> 02:51:29.660]  fact that every single cell of your body is supposed to produce 10% of its
[02:51:29.660 --> 02:51:34.900]  protein content as glutathione but due to toxicity and aging it does not could
[02:51:34.900 --> 02:51:38.340]  glutathione be a missing factor in optimal cell function for your entire
[02:51:38.340 --> 02:51:41.660]  body if you restore the optimal glutathione levels in your cells
[02:51:41.660 --> 02:51:45.540]  especially your glands and organs then as a result your glands and organs work
[02:51:45.540 --> 02:51:49.580]  better imagine the quality of life improvement you might have to order one

[02:54:33.420 --> 02:54:38.100]  had a sore throat went to the doctor today is regular medical practitioner
[02:54:38.100 --> 02:54:42.980]  you know family doctor he goes to Chris went he just called us and said well it
[02:54:42.980 --> 02:54:47.700]  usually cost $60 and I see my doctor all the times this time it cost a hundred
[02:54:47.700 --> 02:54:53.540]  and forty plus dollars and they said it was Obamacare under his insurance and
[02:54:53.540 --> 02:54:57.860]  he didn't get to see his doctor he got to see an internist so here's the article
[02:54:57.860 --> 02:55:02.420]  we have up on infowarstore.com that just went live on the same subject Obamacare
[02:55:02.420 --> 02:55:06.060]  health secretary to dictate how doctors practice medicine yeah through the
[02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:09.620]  computers that was in the bill we knew that they said oh no it's not don't
[02:55:09.620 --> 02:55:14.700]  listen to the racist it's racist not to like what we're doing it's racist not to
[02:55:14.700 --> 02:55:20.940]  drink your fluoride that lowers your IQ ten points as a child when you drink it
[02:55:20.940 --> 02:55:24.820]  in the Harvard study let's go back to an evil woman Amber who's calling from
[02:55:24.820 --> 02:55:30.100]  earth who is who tries to warn people and take time out to warn them that is so
[02:55:30.100 --> 02:55:35.340]  bizarre and weird that is just outrageous Amber go ahead and tell me what
[02:55:35.340 --> 02:55:40.820]  you say to the zombies with the IQ that often we are dealing with them by the
[02:55:40.820 --> 02:55:45.300]  way the survival shield is made me Amber 2.0 I just can't say enough good about
[02:55:45.300 --> 02:55:49.380]  it fantastic he looked at a cloud also of melancholia which was an
[02:55:49.380 --> 02:55:54.820]  unanticipated additional benefit it's fantastic stuff but I can't always I
[02:55:54.820 --> 02:55:57.580]  don't always have a lot of luck getting people to read something and saying
[02:55:57.580 --> 02:56:02.420]  Harvard they might think oh that's scary and brainy but if I do bring up the
[02:56:02.420 --> 02:56:05.780]  analogy of nail hardener which is topically applied and they've seen
[02:56:05.780 --> 02:56:10.380]  little bottles of it you know and say okay let's say fluoride works something
[02:56:10.380 --> 02:56:14.180]  like that you know perhaps topical application maybe there's something
[02:56:14.180 --> 02:56:18.420]  there but would you drink it would you drink the nail hardener to harden your
[02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:22.580]  nails likewise you should not be drinking fluoride it stays in the bones I
[02:56:22.580 --> 02:56:27.100]  was very lucky to have a grandmother who knew this way back in the 70s when they
[02:56:27.100 --> 02:56:31.340]  started fluoridating the water and by the way it was all well known to let you
[02:56:31.340 --> 02:56:35.940]  don't drink sunscreen to keep your skin healthy and it's also been known we
[02:56:35.940 --> 02:56:40.140]  forced the American Dental Association eight years ago to quietly say children
[02:56:40.140 --> 02:56:42.780]  under six shouldn't brush your teeth with fluoride because it actually hurts
[02:56:42.780 --> 02:56:46.380]  their teeth and hurts them I mean they know this they all know because it's not
[02:56:46.380 --> 02:56:53.180]  for your teeth it's for your pineal gland here's Genesis 32 2 2 3 2 when Jacob
[02:56:53.180 --> 02:56:57.980]  wrestled God so Jacob called the place pineal or the seat of the soul it is
[02:56:57.980 --> 02:57:02.740]  because I saw God's face to face and yet my life was spared and what do they
[02:57:02.740 --> 02:57:07.740]  want to attack with the halogen the pineal I mean they know what they're
[02:57:07.740 --> 02:57:10.980]  doing great points God bless you ma'am I'm gonna go to one more caller here before
[02:57:10.980 --> 02:57:14.100]  we go to break is a complimentary five minutes of overdrive always get to the
[02:57:14.100 --> 02:57:23.420]  callers Brian in New Jersey thanks for calling Alex I have quite a few things I
[02:57:23.420 --> 02:57:33.100]  want to cover but go do it do it okay number one I'm homeless and I just
[02:57:33.100 --> 02:57:36.900]  don't know what to do I can't afford the survival shield I hear all the good
[02:57:36.900 --> 02:57:40.300]  products you're promoting and I can't even do anything for myself I'm forced
[02:57:40.300 --> 02:57:44.660]  to eat the GMO's at the local soup kitchen otherwise I'll starve to death
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:50.180]  and that's why that's why we need to buy local and people need to create
[02:57:50.180 --> 02:57:54.340]  organizations and and try to hire the more and more real homeless people who
[02:57:54.340 --> 02:57:58.700]  aren't just drug addicts or mentally ill I see out there because the economy is
[02:57:58.700 --> 02:58:02.140]  falling apart I got so much family that lives with family you see it all over
[02:58:02.140 --> 02:58:07.180]  the country now you know if you can get for even a couple dollars the proper
[02:58:07.180 --> 02:58:10.860]  sea salts check the brand they have iodine in them that are good we've
[02:58:10.860 --> 02:58:17.060]  pointed that out to people and they've got a lot of soup kitchens in places that
[02:58:17.060 --> 02:58:20.740]  I know get their stuff from farmers markets farmers markets should jump
[02:58:20.740 --> 02:58:23.300]  through the government hoops they try to block or go to the city councils and
[02:58:23.300 --> 02:58:27.100]  change the regulations that's an idea people should put on soup kitchens at
[02:58:27.100 --> 02:58:31.100]  farmers markets and churches should be donating to that but they won't they
[02:58:31.100 --> 02:58:35.380]  only donate for the private jet of the preacher you know who's got eight
[02:58:35.380 --> 02:58:46.100]  hookers inside his office right now you are listening to GCN visit GCN live
[02:58:46.100 --> 02:58:55.020]  com today in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods
[02:58:55.020 --> 02:59:00.740]  and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[02:59:00.740 --> 02:59:04.820]  the world guess what else is in the halogen family fluoride ladies and
[02:59:04.820 --> 02:59:09.420]  gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing
[02:59:09.420 --> 02:59:14.860]  and encouraged salt producers to add iodine it's the good halogen on the
[02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:20.220]  periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15-point IQ
[02:59:20.220 --> 02:59:24.820]  increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine bottom line

[03:01:17.620 --> 03:01:24.300]  around his curb I noticed two minivan one is a white one one was a red one and
[03:01:24.300 --> 03:01:30.140]  I noticed that there was a small person standing in front of the back of the
[03:01:30.140 --> 03:01:35.380]  white one and it was covering up the plate the license plate couldn't see
[03:01:35.380 --> 03:01:39.700]  what it was I'll just tell you they this is the spiral out of the citizen spies
[03:01:39.700 --> 03:01:44.300]  is done under surveys now a lot of times with cops backing them up and it's just
[03:01:44.300 --> 03:01:51.020]  hellish but go ahead okay so there's this red one in front of that white part
[03:01:51.020 --> 03:01:54.660]  and you couldn't you know they couldn't see that plate because it was covered up
[03:01:54.660 --> 03:02:00.660]  by the red okay so so tell us what happened well as they came along there
[03:02:00.660 --> 03:02:11.740]  this hand came out with a 357 and it was pointing right at me and I just floored
[03:02:11.740 --> 03:02:19.260]  it did you buy him so I'm gonna there's a lot of stuff in between and I really
[03:02:19.260 --> 03:02:23.460]  don't want to talk about this too much but I this is only well there are a lot
[03:02:23.460 --> 03:02:28.140]  of gang initiations and stuff going on to where I'm you know Michigan as you
[03:02:28.140 --> 03:02:32.420]  know is a great state great people but it's breaking down right now and there's
[03:02:32.420 --> 03:02:35.900]  all sorts of stuff happening where people point guns at each other and there's a
[03:02:35.900 --> 03:02:38.860]  lot of stuff going on but they may have been planning to rob you or did you I
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:44.500]  mean do you see what people look like they just saw the hand the hand come
[03:02:44.500 --> 03:02:48.260]  out okay so what do you what do you think was going on well I think it was
[03:02:48.260 --> 03:02:58.700]  process either gun jammed or I am getting scared off well there's also a
[03:02:58.700 --> 03:03:02.100]  lot of idiot punks out there how many people point guns at me driving around
[03:03:02.100 --> 03:03:06.540]  the road before cuts the body off like pull over point a gun at you and I just
[03:03:06.540 --> 03:03:10.540]  ignore them and you know get away from them because you know last thing I want
[03:03:10.540 --> 03:03:16.580]  to do is have to get in a gun battle but a very interesting story Larry I
[03:03:16.580 --> 03:03:22.460]  appreciate your call drew in Wisconsin drew you're on the air hi Alex hey buddy
[03:03:22.460 --> 03:03:27.220]  may I first just say what an inspiration here you are thank you brother we got
[03:03:27.220 --> 03:03:30.700]  about a minute go ahead all right well I need some advice for you I'm a freshman
[03:03:30.700 --> 03:03:35.420]  college here in Milwaukee and back in June of 2013 in Green Bay Wisconsin where I
[03:03:35.420 --> 03:03:40.300]  used to live at a verbal argument with my father and one of the neighbors called
[03:03:40.300 --> 03:03:43.660]  the police I was outside and all of a sudden five police officers started
[03:03:43.660 --> 03:03:49.060]  walking up my driveway with shotguns pointed at me now as they approached I
[03:03:49.060 --> 03:03:52.780]  had my hands up in an unthreatening manner and they let me to get on the
[03:03:52.780 --> 03:03:56.620]  ground and I asked why at this point two of them put away their guns and pull
[03:03:56.620 --> 03:04:02.700]  out tasers that point I had four taser prongs shot into my body yeah sure now
[03:04:02.700 --> 03:04:06.100]  talking to the police even with your hands up as a crime land of the free
[03:04:06.100 --> 03:04:08.860]  home of the brave you do what you're told me they still want to put up on you
[03:04:08.860 --> 03:04:13.260]  and break your neck why not they took me down on the pavement after that and I was
[03:04:13.260 --> 03:04:16.900]  arrested for a resisting arrest and disorderly conduct which is ridiculous
[03:04:16.900 --> 03:04:20.580]  yeah that's total fraud and then all you do is get the school that you demand a
[03:04:20.580 --> 03:04:23.860]  trial and you show you didn't resist you've had your hands up you just ask
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:29.820]  why and they want us to submit and get on the patty wagon to go to the FEMA
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:33.100]  camp that's what this is all about just like if we instantly ask questions for
[03:04:33.100 --> 03:04:37.300]  terrorists and it's the idea that they can kill us I mean now they just kill
[03:04:37.300 --> 03:04:42.740]  people for no reason and it's the globalist death squad training so they're
[03:04:42.740 --> 03:04:45.340]  gonna try to ruin your life I mean that you know the goal is to get you in the
[03:04:45.340 --> 03:04:50.500]  system and if they don't think you know what you're doing they'll do it I mean
[03:04:50.500 --> 03:04:53.900]  not all police are bad but their leadership is bad all right nightly news
[03:04:53.900 --> 03:04:58.020]  tonight with breaking news on the NFL falling apart after they went anti gun
[03:04:58.020 --> 03:05:13.580]  they can't sell their tickets
