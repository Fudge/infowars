[00:59.260 --> 01:06.480]  Hussein Obama's Kenya situation they'll also be talking about the Barry Sitaro fact that
[01:06.480 --> 01:10.960]  he did give up his US citizenship to become an Indonesian citizen that's a fact and cannot
[01:10.960 --> 01:17.160]  be debated that is on record so Phil Berg will pop in about an hour and a half for 30 minutes

[01:20.960 --> 01:27.560]  up again today it's all happening the global financial meltdown by design is taking place
[01:27.560 --> 01:32.520]  the major central banks are consolidating power through the crises they've orchestrated
[01:32.520 --> 01:38.840]  and I've got the headlines here stocks continue to decline banks rise the last two years the
[01:38.840 --> 01:44.600]  major six banks and their subsidiaries have all had record profits on the backs of free
[01:44.600 --> 01:50.520]  humanity and now a close to two-thirds of all the taxation you pay to the federal government
[01:50.520 --> 01:56.040]  goes to interest on the debt debt service and just like third world nations are basically
[01:56.040 --> 02:00.600]  it's set up by these people and the taxes go up but there's basically no services we
[02:00.600 --> 02:07.520]  are now moving in that direction stocks and oil fall on China rates apple outlook down
[02:07.520 --> 02:12.920]  dollar rallies that's always only in the short term that push gold down today but that's part
[02:12.920 --> 02:16.760]  of a cycle as they rush into bonds and they'll rush back out into gold I would guess the
[02:16.760 --> 02:21.240]  next two weeks gold will probably eclipse even the mega games that it's seen in the
[02:21.240 --> 02:27.800]  last month also stocks continue to decline again banks rise after apple brace for rough

[09:39.720 --> 09:47.760]  up and on the air look at this news i've got here in front of me it is just all incredible
[09:47.760 --> 09:56.160]  here's der spiegel obama's lost magic just doesn't have the magic anymore six months
[09:56.160 --> 10:00.160]  into his presidency at the lowest approval rating of any president six months in and
[10:00.160 --> 10:05.000]  a year in it was the same trend in a year and a half and now close to two years in it's
[10:05.000 --> 10:11.280]  the same story but the globalists plan that all along now they will discard him politically
[10:11.280 --> 10:17.360]  probably going to run hair hillary for president or at least vice president discharging the
[10:17.360 --> 10:24.560]  current vice president joe biden and they'll try to have the novelty of a woman running
[10:24.560 --> 10:29.080]  for vice president and all the women all want to vote it'll be different if they just get
[10:29.080 --> 10:35.480]  a woman in there when hillary helped ram through the end of glass deagle in 1999 allowing
[10:35.480 --> 10:40.440]  the thousands of trillions of derivatives to be pumped out on a planetary scale and
[10:40.440 --> 10:46.800]  for the taxpayers of the globe to be handed the bill thank you very much hillary clinton
[10:46.800 --> 10:52.080]  and their counterparts whether it was tony blair or whether it was friends from meter
[10:52.080 --> 10:59.200]  on or the french german leaders all of them the the greek leaders all eleven years ago
[10:59.200 --> 11:04.520]  the spanish leaders the portuguese leaders the japanese leaders globally they all removed
[11:04.520 --> 11:09.280]  rules on derivatives and just said the sky's the limit select global banks can just issue
[11:09.280 --> 11:16.160]  all the fake counterfeit for financial instruments they want that's just the way it is so we're
[11:16.160 --> 11:23.080]  going to be discussing that obviously today but stocks of course are plunging on bad earnings
[11:23.080 --> 11:31.200]  for apple and many many others and we have just chaos all over europe the epicenter being
[11:31.200 --> 11:37.600]  france where the average frenchman pays over eighty percent in taxes in one way or the
[11:37.600 --> 11:41.700]  other the average frenchman some people only pay around sixty some of the rich pay upwards
[11:41.700 --> 11:47.200]  of ninety but on average and it's basically set by the organization of economic economic
[11:47.200 --> 11:52.520]  and cooperative development the oe cd that france and germany were basically reorganized
[11:52.520 --> 11:58.080]  under during the marshal planet world war two and the un and the club of rome and the
[11:58.080 --> 12:04.240]  cfr have all said that france is the model with a global tax rate that they're shooting
[12:04.240 --> 12:09.840]  for of eighty four percent france isn't quite at eighty four but they're very close england
[12:09.840 --> 12:15.200]  over sixty percent the united states on average you pay federal taxes in one way or another
[12:15.200 --> 12:21.760]  of close to fifty percent and they are called the united states a tax haven or a tax avoidance
[12:21.760 --> 12:30.520]  center unlike some areas of the caribbean or luxenberg or montecarlo or switzerland and
[12:30.520 --> 12:35.880]  they are pushing to quote remove the loopholes show that because the global government doesn't
[12:35.880 --> 12:41.720]  work if you can run to the united states or run somewhere else that has lower taxes you've
[12:41.720 --> 12:47.000]  got to have a global coordination of taxes and regulations and that's what this global
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.240]  government is and through the crises that they that the globalist of publicly designed
[12:52.240 --> 12:59.000]  lovingly carryingly sparing no expense they plan to now bring the system in with a standardized
[12:59.000 --> 13:04.640]  global army global court global regulations of course the world trade organization is
[13:04.640 --> 13:10.560]  one of the major beta test of that now the last fifteen years having more authority
[13:10.560 --> 13:21.920]  over our trade than our congress just a microcosm example of all of that but looking at france
[13:21.920 --> 13:26.800]  right now i want to go over some of those news items and then to your calls as french
[13:26.800 --> 13:34.320]  strikes continue country runs out of gas out of petrol out of diesel as the ongoing
[13:34.320 --> 13:40.880]  strikes in french against austerity continue and then and then what did bill still talk
[13:40.880 --> 13:48.240]  about with a secret of ours yesterday it's a simple equation the vast majority next
[13:48.240 --> 13:59.200]  year approaching two thirds and it accelerates from there of the tax money you pay goes not
[13:59.200 --> 14:05.840]  to roads not to battleships not to cruise missiles not to government employees paychecks
[14:05.840 --> 14:11.600]  not to welfare moms and and and all of that is bad one way or another but at least a welfare
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.320]  mom takes her food stamp card here in texas her lonestar card and goes down to the corner
[14:17.320 --> 14:22.440]  store and you know buys hamburger meat and cereal and lettuce and tomatoes or whatever
[14:22.440 --> 14:26.960]  at least some money goes into the economy as much as i don't like the military industrial
[14:26.960 --> 14:31.480]  complex system getting over two trillion a year one way or the other at least a lot of
[14:31.480 --> 14:36.120]  that goes to defense contractor jobs building bombs and cruise missiles and submarines and
[14:36.120 --> 14:41.320]  b2 bombers at least some of the money ends up in people's hands at the grassroots to
[14:41.320 --> 14:48.840]  then go to dillards and buy a new suit or a pair of tennis shoes or to go to wally world
[14:48.840 --> 14:54.880]  and buy something to go to walmart or or or target or to pay the neighbor kid to mow
[14:54.880 --> 15:03.600]  your lawn or to hire employees but that's not the case under this system someone explain
[15:03.600 --> 15:13.120]  that in nigeria in costa rica and they haven't been totally imploded yet in brazil in just
[15:13.120 --> 15:20.800]  countless other countries in some cases if you look at nigeria they pay over 90 percent
[15:20.800 --> 15:26.080]  of their tax money to debt service and there's famous cases in nigeria one of the best case
[15:26.080 --> 15:31.240]  point examples of where they got a billion dollar loan from the imf back in the sixties
[15:31.240 --> 15:38.280]  and last time i checked they paid over 50 billion dollars on interest on that one billion
[15:38.280 --> 15:41.440]  because by the time they started paying it off it was in the tens of billions and they
[15:41.440 --> 15:48.080]  still owe another 50 something billion so they're going to end up paying hundreds of billions
[15:48.080 --> 15:54.360]  of dollars on a one billion dollar loan and the imf and world bank gave them that loan
[15:54.360 --> 16:00.280]  and many subsequent ones to pay off the old loans and it was literally created out of
[16:00.280 --> 16:08.080]  thin air but backed up by countries that contribute to the imf world bank private consortium fund
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.880]  and the u n puts out all this propaganda about it's helping poor people yeah poor bankers
[16:12.880 --> 16:19.080]  and so your tax money backed it up well now the bankers are just saying look we're even
[16:19.080 --> 16:23.520]  done with that you'll still have your dollars and your pounds and your yens and your yans
[16:23.520 --> 16:28.800]  and your euros and your shekels and your you'll still have all of those you'll still have
[16:28.800 --> 16:34.480]  the peso in mexico you still have the peso you know down in down in guatemala you still
[16:34.480 --> 16:39.680]  have the peso in other latin america countries but they're all going to be globally set by
[16:39.680 --> 16:48.040]  this g20 consortium of central banking heads this is on record and they will set the interest
[16:48.040 --> 16:53.080]  rates and play currencies off against each other just like the g20 announced last year
[16:53.080 --> 17:01.320]  that they were having coordinated devaluation of the currencies coordinated unified strategy
[17:01.320 --> 17:04.480]  and now here we are a year and a half later and they're going oh my goodness there's a
[17:04.480 --> 17:09.000]  currency war countries are fighting with each other to see who can lower their currencies
[17:09.000 --> 17:16.360]  faster this is causing you know hyperinflation meanwhile the federal reserve comes out the
[17:16.360 --> 17:20.360]  north american branch of this group says oh we're going to have quantitative easing and
[17:20.360 --> 17:25.200]  money printing to pay off the debt but then they go oh isn't it horrible currencies are
[17:25.200 --> 17:29.880]  going down they openly carry out the policy and then go oh my gosh it's terrible what
[17:29.880 --> 17:35.120]  it's doing we've got an answer give us more power and so now for the last five years they've
[17:35.120 --> 17:41.280]  been issuing sdrs i have confirmed that an overseas shipping it's printed on usps us
[17:41.280 --> 17:46.480]  postal service its conversion rate it's about one point five takes one point five one point
[17:46.480 --> 17:54.520]  five nine sdrs one sdrs worth one point five nine dollars so we're already under sdrs it's
[17:54.520 --> 18:00.000]  like two years ago the texas workforce commission sent me a letter before it was even in world
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.080]  net daily i'd noticed this and then about two weeks later it was in world net daily
[18:03.080 --> 18:07.120]  Jerome course he wrote a story about it but i can confirm it and back then i guess two
[18:07.120 --> 18:11.400]  years ago we had about 15 employees and contractors and the texas workforce commission sent me
[18:11.400 --> 18:16.440]  a letter about increased worker comp taxes and insurance taxes and things you know it's
[18:16.440 --> 18:21.160]  going up every time i turn around and it said you now under federal government rules we
[18:21.160 --> 18:26.160]  do not report to the federal government we report to the north american union body and
[18:26.160 --> 18:31.240]  i showed that texas worth force commission letter here on air and course he got copies
[18:31.240 --> 18:36.360]  of them around the country it's kind of like before health care even passed earlier this
[18:36.360 --> 18:40.840]  year remember in illinois and we we showed this on air and also wrote an article about
[18:40.840 --> 18:45.560]  it and then mainstream media picked it up that they were already instructing businesses
[18:45.560 --> 18:51.600]  on the new taxes and on how under federal law they had to get insurance and the state
[18:51.600 --> 18:57.120]  was implementing it before the law was even passed that's because this global governance
[18:57.120 --> 19:02.800]  puts all this in place and then tells you about it later kind of like by 1993 every state
[19:02.800 --> 19:06.880]  in the united states all 50 had standardized drivers license issuance under the federal
[19:06.880 --> 19:15.400]  government itself in 2000 a un summit in australia where they unified globally the drivers license
[19:15.400 --> 19:20.320]  and passports and so here we are 10 years later and they're just now getting around
[19:20.320 --> 19:25.480]  telling you about global IDs and then a decade plus after we already had an actual ID card
[19:25.480 --> 19:32.400]  they got around to telling you and but it still has your state on it so it looks like
[19:32.400 --> 19:40.240]  it's local same thing with these sdars and so we're already in the world government
[19:40.240 --> 19:47.800]  that's kind of like they had the 50th anniversary of the e you in 2007 because in 1957 they
[19:47.800 --> 19:52.520]  did set up the e you with the treaty of rome i have a copy of it it's in the film in game
[19:52.520 --> 19:57.800]  it's online you can read it but they told the europeans they were in e you in 2000 they
[19:57.800 --> 20:02.040]  were in it in 1957 we're already in the n a u are you concerned about dropping or losing

[21:24.120 --> 21:29.680]  CBO is drawing a parallel between US economy and the Greek economic meltdown debt to GDP
[21:29.680 --> 21:34.080]  climbing to unfamiliar territory and deficits rising to unsupportable levels.

[22:04.680 --> 22:08.000]  What have we got a republic or a monarchy?
[22:08.000 --> 22:12.840]  A republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not
[22:12.840 --> 22:17.720]  mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[22:17.720 --> 22:23.120]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to define who

[24:07.160 --> 24:14.040]  here all the different financial news that's just amazing but I want to quantify this very
[24:14.040 --> 24:21.640]  simply because I have this gut check every day now multiple times a day it shocks my
[24:21.640 --> 24:30.000]  intellect when I realize just how real this world government is just how real the weaponization
[24:30.000 --> 24:35.240]  of the medical system against us is just how real all the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[24:35.240 --> 24:42.080]  are about chemicals and pathogens added to vaccines to give us cancer and sterilizes
[24:42.080 --> 24:46.920]  I mean that's real the government's shooting up watermelon children with syphilis that's
[24:46.920 --> 24:54.040]  real this year the UN worldwide giving children weaponized polio and murdering them is AP
[24:54.040 --> 24:59.240]  and CBS but they report it like it's no big deal Bayer Pharmaceutical shipping out over
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.760]  a million ampoules of a factor 8 blood product with knowing it had HIV in it on record and
[25:05.760 --> 25:11.840]  hepatitis that's real the government knowing DU is a death sentence for our military that's
[25:11.840 --> 25:18.320]  real the model states health emergency powers act force inoculation program that's real
[25:18.320 --> 25:23.960]  the national emergency centers act for FEMA camps that's real the military openly announcing
[25:23.960 --> 25:28.240]  they will patrol and take over the US during financial collapse guess what it wasn't for
[25:28.240 --> 25:35.440]  Al Qaeda like I told you nine years ago that's real this is all real this is all really happening
[25:35.440 --> 25:40.120]  and more and more I wake up at 1 2 3 in the morning after I've been asleep a few hours
[25:40.120 --> 25:46.840]  because I control my fear I control my concern when I'm conscious and awake because I'm on
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.360]  a mission but when I'm asleep I end up having dreams about this I guess you'd call them
[25:51.360 --> 25:57.880]  nightmares and every night now I just wake up I'm in the dark I walk around the house
[25:57.880 --> 26:02.400]  I go into my children's bedrooms I look at them innocent goods sweet they deserve to
[26:02.400 --> 26:08.720]  not live under tyranny and I just sat on the couch for about an hour last night just wishing
[26:08.720 --> 26:15.400]  I was wrong wishing 9-11 wasn't an inside job wishing that our country wasn't imploded
[26:15.400 --> 26:20.800]  by design wishing because I know how bad it's going to be not just for my family but your
[26:20.800 --> 26:25.320]  family and for all the foolish people that are compartmentalized and dumbed down who
[26:25.320 --> 26:30.060]  have been given a false mental template of society all the people that are enabling this
[26:30.060 --> 26:36.440]  to happen by sitting on the bench or actively helping the globalist we've had crooks take
[26:36.440 --> 26:43.040]  over our society and they develop scientific systems to dumb people down and to misdirect
[26:43.040 --> 26:50.800]  and control populations and it is even more horrific and more real than I had first you
[26:50.800 --> 26:57.520]  know years ago surmised from their own admissions and documents and I want to ask callers you
[26:57.520 --> 27:03.840]  know do you have these gut checks are you concerned because I call it fear when I'm
[27:03.840 --> 27:08.800]  awake and conscious right now I'm not afraid but when I wake up in the middle of the night
[27:08.800 --> 27:18.120]  it's not even really fear it's more concern it's more sorrow it's more nostalgia for
[27:18.120 --> 27:23.160]  the present as bad as things are now this is a cakewalk compared to where we're going
[27:23.160 --> 27:33.480]  and it's just a deep-seated wish and desire to do a better job I mean it's such an overpowering
[27:33.480 --> 27:38.840]  responsibility to know what's happening to understand what the globalist have done to
[27:38.840 --> 27:46.280]  have their number to know their modus operandi to understand who they are and understand just
[27:46.280 --> 27:51.960]  how sadistic and psychopathic and wicked they are and how much danger we are all in including
[27:51.960 --> 27:59.880]  people that serve this system and I use the example a lot of Abu Ghraib and other torture
[27:59.880 --> 28:06.920]  centers all over Iraq in the Middle East and into Central Asia and Afghanistan and Eastern
[28:06.920 --> 28:11.680]  Europe and Western Europe and all the secret black sites and the giant cadres of torture
[28:11.680 --> 28:16.160]  teams they've created that even torture people's children according to the army's own report
[28:16.160 --> 28:21.120]  in front of their parents I mean that is a bold evil that the government would go ahead
[28:21.120 --> 28:26.480]  with that and that when their own minions get caught doing it they send them to prison
[28:26.480 --> 28:32.160]  for following orders that ought to tell you about the hypocrisy and just the level of
[28:32.160 --> 28:39.440]  bona fide naked wickedness that we're dealing with here the sky is the limit with these
[28:39.440 --> 28:46.760]  people just what we know about the globalist is unspeakably bad imagine what we don't know
[28:46.760 --> 28:49.800]  I mean there's a whole bunch of mainstream news articles this week we've got links to
[28:49.800 --> 28:57.120]  them up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com with you know AP Reuters the mail BBC going
[28:57.120 --> 29:02.880]  okay yeah hundreds of thousands got Guillain beret and narcolepsy and epilepsy and brain
[29:02.880 --> 29:08.800]  damage and autoimmune problems from the vaccine from the H1N1 exactly as we told you a year
[29:08.800 --> 29:13.160]  ago and how did we tell you exactly a year ago what would happen because we've lived
[29:13.160 --> 29:19.520]  through this over and over again we just have the courage to read the insert on the vaccine
[29:19.520 --> 29:23.400]  it isn't an accident it isn't just profit taking by these companies they cold bloodedly
[29:23.400 --> 29:28.160]  know what they're doing they're testing killing us and maiming us out in the open and getting
[29:28.160 --> 29:35.640]  away with it and every time my wife said a grocery store she sees people lined up taking
[29:35.640 --> 29:40.720]  the shots and it freaks her out it freaks me out you want to just go up more in these

[33:46.680 --> 33:52.840]  all the evidence shows currently to not speak out against this corruption than it is to
[33:52.840 --> 33:58.200]  speak out against it if we fight this as hard as we can we may be able to back them down
[33:58.200 --> 34:03.520]  slow them down while we grow our numbers but if people don't stand up and I'm talking to
[34:03.520 --> 34:08.080]  other talk show host I'm talking to mainline talk show host you know they're not stupid
[34:08.080 --> 34:13.800]  they know this stuff's real and if they keep playing along with this you're not going to

[34:31.080 --> 34:35.920]  and a total control grid has been put in place ahead of the implosion we're now descending
[34:35.920 --> 34:40.480]  into now I'm done ranting about that I got a bunch of news I want to cover but let's start
[34:40.480 --> 34:46.480]  going to your phone calls let's talk to a mat in minnesota you're on the air hey alex
[34:46.480 --> 34:52.360]  uh... I have to share a new story with you but uh... first yeah in regards to the uh...
[34:52.360 --> 34:57.800]  the economic collapse uh... I think the the crisis is going to get a lot worse before
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.640]  it gets better and you know that's based on a lot of the information that's out there
[35:02.640 --> 35:06.960]  even they always create a new crisis then get more power than create a new crisis this
[35:06.960 --> 35:15.320]  is all designed right it's it's just the news every day is just more and more ridiculous
[35:15.320 --> 35:19.360]  and and like you said uh... and and this is something you talk about i think in terris
[35:19.360 --> 35:25.440]  form is that whether it's it's it's the military strategy or these economic strategies i mean
[35:25.440 --> 35:30.160]  they're they're even more bold than than hitler and and we believe these guys they just say
[35:30.160 --> 35:36.440]  the stuff right out in the open and if they they talk about these crazy strategies and
[35:36.440 --> 35:42.120]  it's just amazing that more and more people really aren't picking up on it
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.320]  i hear you uh... what's your uh... point on the economy matt
[35:46.320 --> 35:48.520]  all week well you know
[35:48.520 --> 35:52.960]  i just wanted to uh... in regards to that city economy and controlling the people
[35:52.960 --> 35:57.880]  there was a news article in uh... the start of you in the local paper here in minnesota
[35:57.880 --> 36:02.720]  and the headline is president can out speech dissenters
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.440]  and it says a president and they are free to screen audiences for his public speeches
[36:07.440 --> 36:11.240]  and to remove those who may disagree with him well you know the supreme the supreme
[36:11.240 --> 36:15.240]  court just ruled last week that uh... under chaining
[36:15.240 --> 36:19.560]  and bush uh... they would if you had a democratic or union bumper sticker
[36:19.560 --> 36:21.960]  at a supposed public town hall
[36:21.960 --> 36:25.480]  uh... that they would kick people out or not allow them in even though they
[36:25.480 --> 36:29.720]  advertise it as a public event and so yeah that's what they're talking about
[36:29.720 --> 36:34.000]  that's that that that's exactly right they they uh... in the article they
[36:34.000 --> 36:37.600]  cited some woman who had a uh... you know no no more blood for your bumper
[36:37.600 --> 36:40.560]  sticker but i think that's pretty amazing because i mean this is just a
[36:40.560 --> 36:42.840]  small article in the middle of the paper
[36:42.840 --> 36:45.280]  and i mean this is just more
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.560]  announcement of just the overt dictatorship that really exists in this
[36:48.560 --> 36:51.720]  country you know and notice how everything bush did
[36:51.720 --> 36:53.560]  obama has
[36:53.560 --> 36:55.560]  turbocharged it and the next president
[36:55.560 --> 36:57.240]  will turbo charge it
[36:57.240 --> 37:00.160]  and there's no doubt they're gonna put a republican and they're gonna blow up a
[37:00.160 --> 37:01.960]  bunch of stuff after the end of office
[37:01.960 --> 37:03.360]  and say al-qaeda did it
[37:03.360 --> 37:06.840]  and then use the the control grid are in place against the american people mad i
[37:06.840 --> 37:07.920]  appreciate your call
[37:07.920 --> 37:11.040]  before i go back to calls me had a few police state news items here
[37:11.040 --> 37:12.920]  the good the bad and the ugly
[37:12.920 --> 37:14.280]  uh... here's the bad
[37:14.280 --> 37:16.360]  u.s. pushes to ease
[37:16.360 --> 37:18.760]  technical obstacles to wiretapping
[37:18.760 --> 37:21.560]  and they go on to admit no warrants no nothing
[37:21.560 --> 37:24.400]  they just want more control systems in
[37:24.400 --> 37:29.040]  to eighty and t for rising comcast where they can automatically tap anything
[37:29.040 --> 37:31.880]  uh... without a warrant well we already know that's in place but there's the
[37:31.880 --> 37:34.000]  new york times just announcing it to people
[37:34.000 --> 37:35.400]  uh... here's the good
[37:35.400 --> 37:38.400]  uh... you can photograph that federal building
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.760]  all over the country police will march up local police federal doesn't matter
[37:42.760 --> 37:43.680]  and they'll say
[37:43.680 --> 37:47.280]  uh... you can't videotape uh... the demonstration you can't videotape
[37:47.280 --> 37:50.640]  the police from even a hundred yards away when they're out in public view and
[37:50.640 --> 37:54.440]  they'll arrest you for wiretapping they just been losing in court on that
[37:54.440 --> 37:56.920]  you know there's no perception of privacy in a public place
[37:56.920 --> 38:00.040]  how do they videotape us same issue
[38:00.040 --> 38:03.200]  he's dropping would be if you went and stuck a camera in somebody's backyard
[38:03.200 --> 38:05.680]  you know through their window shades they were undressing
[38:05.680 --> 38:07.840]  that's what happened in the course pennsylvania
[38:07.840 --> 38:10.640]  in other states where the schools are watching the kids at home
[38:10.640 --> 38:12.620]  over their government issue laptops
[38:12.620 --> 38:15.120]  and the court said they can do that
[38:15.120 --> 38:18.360]  but they didn't settle to uh... so wouldn't get appealed
[38:18.360 --> 38:22.920]  continuing so uh... of the bad as they're expanding warrantless wiretapping
[38:22.920 --> 38:24.640]  the good is
[38:24.640 --> 38:27.960]  the right of photographers to stand public places and take pictures of federal
[38:27.960 --> 38:31.400]  buildings have been upheld by a legal settlement reached in new york
[38:31.400 --> 38:34.320]  in the ever escalating skirmishes between photographers and security
[38:34.320 --> 38:35.300]  agencies
[38:35.300 --> 38:37.880]  the most significant battlefield is probably the public
[38:37.880 --> 38:40.840]  uh... way streets and sidewalks parks and plazas
[38:40.840 --> 38:42.560]  which have customarily been regarded as
[38:42.560 --> 38:44.880]  advantage from which photography cannot be
[38:44.880 --> 38:46.800]  uh... and should not be barred
[38:46.800 --> 38:49.680]  uh... but it goes on to how the feds would arrest people doing that
[38:49.680 --> 38:53.320]  uh... same things going on in england and and of course real terrorist would
[38:53.320 --> 38:55.000]  just go to google street view
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.600]  and get as if real terrorists exist
[38:57.600 --> 38:59.160]  outside of fantasy land
[38:59.160 --> 39:01.600]  uh... you know the terrorist are those running the federal government they
[39:01.600 --> 39:04.720]  stage the terror to set up a police state that's obvious and they admit it
[39:04.720 --> 39:07.280]  they issue terror alerts for political gain that's admitted
[39:07.280 --> 39:09.080]  and this is all out in the open
[39:09.080 --> 39:12.760]  uh... but you know they're claim of all you can't videotape the police you
[39:12.760 --> 39:14.520]  can't videotape this building
[39:14.520 --> 39:17.600]  it's asinine so that's been overturned court
[39:17.600 --> 39:18.960]  that is some good news
[39:18.960 --> 39:23.200]  uh... so uh... and and here's the ugly news of the good and bad and ugly
[39:23.200 --> 39:26.720]  and we have a clip of this up on info wars dot com
[39:26.720 --> 39:28.240]  it's a bc news
[39:28.240 --> 39:29.760]  newborn child
[39:29.760 --> 39:33.440]  taken away because of bagel
[39:33.440 --> 39:36.240]  and i constantly in the news here about
[39:36.240 --> 39:40.520]  thirty forty fifty year old people with no criminal record
[39:40.520 --> 39:45.320]  at major corporations having to give urine or now blood samples or hair samples
[39:45.320 --> 39:47.880]  and a hair sample goes back to your entire life
[39:47.880 --> 39:50.120]  and i tend to eat
[39:50.120 --> 39:54.000]  bagels of poppy seeds at least once a week in fact i had some this weekend
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.800]  and and there are a lot of hamburger buns at nicer
[39:56.800 --> 39:58.720]  you know hamburger uh... shacks
[39:58.720 --> 40:02.880]  uh... and it causes no affect mentally does nothing
[40:02.880 --> 40:04.240]  it gives a
[40:04.240 --> 40:05.760]  false positive
[40:05.760 --> 40:07.480]  for opiates
[40:07.480 --> 40:09.640]  and i've seen these cases before
[40:09.640 --> 40:13.080]  you know they don't tell a woman that when she's getting blood work done
[40:13.080 --> 40:15.600]  uh... before she has a baby in after
[40:15.600 --> 40:18.680]  uh... and a lot of times there's false positives that's also come out for
[40:18.680 --> 40:20.240]  marijuana
[40:20.240 --> 40:21.880]  uh... for other drugs
[40:21.880 --> 40:25.560]  uh... there are a lot of uh... cold medicines and medicines that deal of
[40:25.560 --> 40:26.600]  uh... obviously
[40:26.600 --> 40:28.000]  with allergies
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.480]  uh... that have uh... things that are precursors to methamphetamine in them
[40:32.480 --> 40:33.600]  uh... and
[40:33.600 --> 40:37.080]  once the cps takes your child they don't care if you go get more blood work
[40:37.080 --> 40:40.600]  they don't care if it shows that you weren't starting methamphetamine or
[40:40.600 --> 40:42.960]  taking heroin or opiates or
[40:42.960 --> 40:44.920]  or or oxy cotton
[40:44.920 --> 40:48.120]  they take your child and that's the way it is
[40:48.120 --> 40:50.640]  so parents should know that the hospitals
[40:50.640 --> 40:53.160]  our spy grids
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.360]  and many drug tests they have as high as a third of the time false positives
[40:57.360 --> 41:00.400]  uh... this is a story that will likely outrage many moms
[41:00.400 --> 41:03.640]  lives more gay birth to a beautiful baby girl with the next day police and
[41:03.640 --> 41:06.160]  child protective services in pennsylvania

[41:07.520 --> 41:10.960]  came to her home and took the infant from her all because of a bagel
[41:10.960 --> 41:13.720]  lives more to say she never saw it coming i was shocked
[41:13.720 --> 41:16.640]  i was a loss for words i was started crying she said
[41:16.640 --> 41:19.720]  child protective services pennsylvania where the doorstep taking her one day
[41:19.720 --> 41:20.680]  old baby

[41:27.600 --> 41:29.720]  and at that time i never heard of it before
[41:29.720 --> 41:32.960]  it means that they have to take custody of your child more said
[41:32.960 --> 41:34.760]  uh... and says that
[41:34.760 --> 41:38.400]  jameson hospital in newcastle pennsylvania newcastle
[41:38.400 --> 41:42.080]  i saw this in ninety eight was in the a p
[41:42.080 --> 41:45.320]  a guy was walking through a wal-mart parking lot the police cruiser windows
[41:45.320 --> 41:46.160]  were down
[41:46.160 --> 41:48.880]  the german shepherd jumped out

[41:56.120 --> 41:57.880]  neighborhood and a big dog ran out
[41:57.880 --> 41:58.920]  growling at her
[41:58.920 --> 42:01.840]  and she said you get out of here you get out of here
[42:01.840 --> 42:04.920]  and the dog backed off and the owner came out and said hey don't be mean to my dog
[42:04.920 --> 42:06.080]  he just looks mean
[42:06.080 --> 42:09.880]  one of these people with big vicious dogs who aren't trained
[42:09.880 --> 42:11.920]  who get off on menacing people
[42:11.920 --> 42:15.000]  and then their dog runs out at your wife should never pepper spray she screams
[42:15.000 --> 42:16.360]  at it and they get mad

[43:41.320 --> 43:43.840]  what a freak zone newcastle p a is
[43:43.840 --> 43:46.680]  and i guess near there they will watch kids on their laptops at home and in
[43:46.680 --> 43:49.640]  the shower but that's okay they say it's all part of freedom
[43:49.640 --> 43:51.600]  all part of nineteen eighty four

[44:37.800 --> 44:38.640]  new one
[44:38.640 --> 44:43.880]  ten years before that i saw an article in nineteen ninety eight about it

[45:10.880 --> 45:13.920]  so uh... it get to goes on
[45:13.920 --> 45:16.800]  the hospital issued a statement saying we have initiated investigation to
[45:16.800 --> 45:19.560]  compare our standards to the community in regional hospitals
[45:19.560 --> 45:22.680]  if necessary we will advise our reference lab require the standards for
[45:22.680 --> 45:25.520]  consistency
[45:25.520 --> 45:29.040]  and uh...
[45:29.040 --> 45:32.040]  it goes on to say opium comes from the poppy plant
[45:32.040 --> 45:34.720]  ingesting poppy seeds can cause levels of morphine and
[45:34.720 --> 45:36.080]  coding in a person's urine
[45:36.080 --> 45:39.760]  well oftentimes they give women morphine when they're having a painful birth
[45:39.760 --> 45:41.520]  i guess they take your child for that too
[45:41.520 --> 45:45.920]  on that day list gave birth she ate a everything bagel from dunkin donuts
[45:45.920 --> 45:49.240]  a bagel with lots of poppy seeds now the local acl use talking
[45:49.240 --> 45:50.280]  taking on the case
[45:50.280 --> 45:52.720]  hospital issued a statement basically uh...
[45:52.720 --> 45:55.640]  saying we have initiated investigation to compare our standards
[45:55.640 --> 45:57.680]  the community in regional hospitals
[45:57.680 --> 46:01.120]  and necessary will advise our reference lab to critique their standards i
[46:01.120 --> 46:02.160]  understand that
[46:02.160 --> 46:05.760]  but they're doing the protect children but they should investigate it more
[46:05.760 --> 46:06.880]  like i
[46:06.880 --> 46:10.680]  have to drive by that place every day when i go to work and i just cry every
[46:10.680 --> 46:11.640]  time
[46:11.640 --> 46:14.720]  so far no lawsuits been filed
[46:14.720 --> 46:17.880]  isn't clear they even gave a child back
[46:17.880 --> 46:21.000]  but side issue i just wanted to let you know about that
[46:21.000 --> 46:22.400]  uh... so
[46:22.400 --> 46:26.080]  when the police dog jumps out of a car and runs at you you need to get on the
[46:26.080 --> 46:29.400]  ground and just show your throat and say kill me
[46:29.400 --> 46:32.680]  because that officer is worth more than you and your whole family
[46:32.680 --> 46:35.600]  and i've seen all these other police cases where you've seen the video on the
[46:35.600 --> 46:36.240]  news

[47:54.680 --> 47:58.000]  the global debt you mentioned that earlier and and i'm just thinking
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.120]  uh... long lines of just total global default is what it's going to take you
[48:02.120 --> 48:05.120]  mentioned that that levels you talk about a country that we don't know this
[48:05.120 --> 48:09.800]  money that's what ron paul said last week default on the banker debt

[48:12.680 --> 48:16.240]  yeah they will go they've they've robbed the middle class of basically taken
[48:16.240 --> 48:20.240]  all our money and and pumped up the elite and and and and and and kept them
[48:20.240 --> 48:23.120]  afloat while they're going to let everybody else talk well more than kept
[48:23.120 --> 48:25.520]  them afloat i've got uh...
[48:25.520 --> 48:28.200]  the headline here
[48:28.200 --> 48:31.040]  stocks down but bank stocks up so
[48:31.040 --> 48:33.640]  show them over i mean they're not just keeping afloat they're doing really
[48:33.640 --> 48:34.680]  good right now
[48:34.680 --> 48:38.280]  let me talk about stocks and i'm i'm deep into the stock market and and and
[48:38.280 --> 48:43.400]  follow it every day and it is just more frustrating to see the the manipulation
[48:43.400 --> 48:47.400]  you you talk to me to go about what would you sit up at night worry about
[48:47.400 --> 48:50.800]  what makes it and and my focus other than
[48:50.800 --> 48:54.240]  really everything my children you mentioned your children
[48:54.240 --> 48:57.960]  it's just to see the blatant manipulation the blatant
[48:57.960 --> 49:02.240]  purchasing of the of the stock market keeping it afloat and and the illusion
[49:02.240 --> 49:04.040]  that that all as well
[49:04.040 --> 49:09.040]  to keep it alive to keep the pensions alive to keep it it's absolutely
[49:09.040 --> 49:10.040]  disgusting
[49:10.040 --> 49:11.560]  see it happening
[49:11.560 --> 49:15.480]  it is and it's it's so obviously unbelievably criminal and criminal
[49:15.480 --> 49:19.160]  isn't even the word for it it's it's just open total fraud
[49:19.160 --> 49:20.240]  out in the open
[49:20.240 --> 49:23.840]  it even came out in congress the goldman sacks and others premeditated this
[49:23.840 --> 49:25.640]  it's happening globally the same
[49:25.640 --> 49:27.840]  six banks are doing it in concert
[49:27.840 --> 49:29.440]  and it's either us or them
[49:29.440 --> 49:32.920]  and we've got to default on this debt there are people like well that'll
[49:32.920 --> 49:35.800]  devalue the dollar they're already devaluing it
[49:35.800 --> 49:37.440]  they're already planning
[49:37.440 --> 49:40.720]  to in the name of propping it up transfer all the rest of the wealth of
[49:40.720 --> 49:42.040]  themselves it's left
[49:42.040 --> 49:43.840]  and then defaulted
[49:43.840 --> 49:45.880]  on top of it i mean
[49:45.880 --> 49:48.440]  we've got to default on it now
[49:48.440 --> 49:49.860]  getting out of it
[49:49.860 --> 49:52.920]  to what you're always it would we've been talking about it or they've been
[49:52.920 --> 49:56.480]  talking about it default flag what is going to be the catalyst
[49:56.480 --> 50:00.160]  uh... that it finally rips it from everybody's control i mean i think this
[50:00.160 --> 50:03.840]  this charade can go on as long as the threat that can print money
[50:03.840 --> 50:08.560]  as long as nobody's there to stop them as long as we have nobody in in power
[50:08.560 --> 50:12.360]  to to stop the charade and we get to a pretty little something up and blame it
[50:12.360 --> 50:13.520]  on the american people
[50:13.520 --> 50:17.280]  that's what we've got to keep exposing inside job terror to take that trick
[50:17.280 --> 50:18.480]  away from them
[50:18.480 --> 50:19.680]  just like building seven
[50:19.680 --> 50:21.680]  and it's it's that's that's the
[50:21.680 --> 50:24.240]  you know to me that's the one
[50:24.240 --> 50:26.720]  positive proof about nine eleven
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.760]  about the pentagon but we will there's going to be some catalyst i believe
[50:30.760 --> 50:34.160]  that that's going to finally rip up the stock markets from their control and
[50:34.160 --> 50:35.240]  finally rip
[50:35.240 --> 50:37.720]  all this crap that they're doing
[50:37.720 --> 50:41.600]  uh... well allow us our our our opening to come in
[50:41.600 --> 50:43.840]  shanky good point i got a job but
[50:43.840 --> 50:47.800]  that catalyst is already begun over eighty percent of americans major polls
[50:47.800 --> 50:51.080]  know the federal reserves private they want audited they want to shut it down
[50:51.080 --> 50:53.840]  as the bigger brzezinski said humankind is awake

[54:06.440 --> 54:14.120]  her on the air pretty good sir well like usual I have to agree with everything
[54:14.120 --> 54:19.560]  you say uh you know these people aren't ignorant economics 101 I was caught back
[54:19.560 --> 54:25.080]  in the 80s that uh trickle down economic theory is the antithesis or or
[54:25.080 --> 54:30.440]  globalization is the antithesis to trickle down a theory so these people
[54:30.440 --> 54:32.920]  know what they're doing and they know that nothing's going to get better
[54:32.920 --> 54:36.560]  until we go back to being a sovereign nation printing our own money oh they
[54:36.560 --> 54:41.000]  say they want they say they want a post-industrial world yeah they know
[54:41.000 --> 54:44.360]  what they're doing I you know every day I listened to you and every day I'm
[54:44.360 --> 54:48.080]  reminded of Brave New World and Brave New World were visited were Huxley who was
[54:48.080 --> 54:53.720]  an insider and knew these things said that and only the abnormally normal would
[54:53.720 --> 54:57.200]  be able to adapt to the society they were going to create the rest of us would
[54:57.200 --> 55:00.320]  turn into John the savages and either kill ourselves or be killed by the
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.640]  system and you know every day I feel more and more like John the savage
[55:04.640 --> 55:09.160]  watching all this stuff happen and man you know I really appreciate what you
[55:09.160 --> 55:12.760]  do and I don't really know what the answer is except revolution I agree
[55:12.760 --> 55:16.920]  with what Max Kaiser said yesterday I cannot believe the people in the
[55:16.920 --> 55:22.040]  paper so weak will and have turned into what they've turned into when you look
[55:22.040 --> 55:26.040]  at France there's millions of people in the strip today shutting down a society
[55:26.040 --> 55:32.160]  burning down the institutions and you know what has happened to America how
[55:32.160 --> 55:37.760]  do you people allowed yourself to be so chemically and media a lobotomized I
[55:37.760 --> 55:42.480]  don't understand it well understand it I look look I'm not criticizing the
[55:42.480 --> 55:47.920]  French but at the same time we are seeing a big awakening we are seeing
[55:47.920 --> 55:51.880]  court victories we are seeing a lot of the states move towards sovereignty and
[55:51.880 --> 56:00.080]  Tenth Amendment and whereas people should be in the streets the issue is the
[56:00.080 --> 56:06.200]  violence allows the system to bring in more controls and so if you actually
[56:06.200 --> 56:11.480]  read the IMF World Bank documents from 2002 they talk about how they do this in
[56:11.480 --> 56:15.840]  third world countries they create an atmosphere that creates social unrest
[56:15.840 --> 56:19.040]  and they use that as a pretext to come in with more control so it's a very
[56:19.040 --> 56:24.280]  delicate balance here and we see the system trying to demonize yours truly
[56:24.280 --> 56:27.280]  claiming I'm calling for violence when I'm calling for the opposite I mean
[56:27.280 --> 56:32.280]  George Soros publications attack yours truly every day now saying I'm calling
[56:32.280 --> 56:36.880]  for violence basically I should be arrested and so again they create the
[56:36.880 --> 56:41.280]  climate where a lot of people reasonably you know start wanting to go in that
[56:41.280 --> 56:46.440]  direction but it's a setup down the road I am never for offensive violence but I
[56:46.440 --> 56:50.920]  am forgetting politicians faces and going to every meeting and demonstrations
[56:50.920 --> 56:54.960]  and exposing the cops when they come out and try to hire provocateurs I am for
[56:54.960 --> 56:59.360]  exercising our rights I am for calling for criminal investigations and
[56:59.360 --> 57:03.320]  grand jury indictments of Federal Reserve board members as Ron Paul is
[57:03.320 --> 57:08.360]  called for but the pen is mightier than the sword 90% of war is now info war
[57:08.360 --> 57:12.280]  Pentagon says that themselves and I remember reading that you know 15 years
[57:12.280 --> 57:15.680]  ago when I was looking around for a name for a website info wars.com was
[57:15.680 --> 57:21.160]  available and I went and registered at what 1996 started in 1997 took me almost
[57:21.160 --> 57:24.640]  a year to get a webmaster and figure it all out because it was just myself and
[57:24.640 --> 57:28.680]  my girlfriend and Mike Hansen working on the operation at that time just the
[57:28.680 --> 57:38.960]  three of us now my wife but look this we won't beat them overnight but here's
[57:38.960 --> 57:43.840]  the here's the key people are ready for the truth now this stuff's all out in
[57:43.840 --> 57:46.920]  the open so a lot of you beat your head against the wall for decades trying to
[57:46.920 --> 57:50.040]  wake folks up and got laughed at you're not going to get as much of that now and
[57:50.040 --> 57:54.120]  the beating your head against the wall the seeds you planted a decade ago those
[57:54.120 --> 57:58.440]  are now sprouting today so seeds you plant today will sprout in a year not
[57:58.440 --> 58:03.040]  in 10 years some will sprout overnight some will sprout a year later but you
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.880]  just got to keep planting the seeds of truth because as Victor Hugo the French
[58:06.880 --> 58:11.120]  philosopher said no army could stop an idea whose time has come anything else
[58:11.120 --> 58:16.680]  well I found Eric Holder coming on TV last night and announcing that the
[58:16.680 --> 58:19.880]  federal government would come in and intervene if California legalized
[58:19.880 --> 58:24.880]  marijuana was very interesting when he was just on TV 18 months ago saying how
[58:24.880 --> 58:28.040]  they were going to support the state's rights to make and enforce the drug laws
[58:28.040 --> 58:31.160]  the way they saw fit yeah that's because they thought they could beat it but
[58:31.160 --> 58:34.560]  because they failed they're coming in great point yeah I'm in the federal
[58:34.560 --> 58:40.360]  government has no business regulating in-state commerce we'll be right back
[58:40.920 --> 58:49.360]  you are listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today

[59:04.200 --> 59:08.720]  turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[59:08.720 --> 59:13.520]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[59:13.520 --> 59:17.880]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[59:17.880 --> 59:23.120]  nation the criminal off-short cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on

[01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.960]  great to have you here what's on your mind hey I got a quick question and a
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:19.240]  quick comment my question is have you ever talked about Colonel Jim Sabo that
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:25.280]  rings that he's the military Marine pilot that was allegedly had committed
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:30.720]  suicide out there in California in January of 1991 you know it rings the
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:34.800]  bell why don't you refresh my memory well he was apparently he was gonna blow
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.320]  the whistle on the CIA for running drugs right there out of that Marine air base
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:42.240]  well I know they've killed a lot of Army and Marine Corps and Navy and Air Force
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:46.960]  investigators and whistleblowers I've seen a lot of cases of that but I don't
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.880]  remember the particulars of the case the thing is his brother's a doctor out of
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:55.920]  South Dakota and has been rallying you know to clear his name basically and
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:00.080]  you know it'd be great if you could get him on your show if he was willing to
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:03.920]  come on and talk about that situation you know from set some light on that
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.760]  also I'd like to comment on the the Fort Hood trial I'm here at Fort Hood and
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.840]  the news story that came out yesterday or the day before about the cell phone
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.520]  video that disappeared I find that to be pretty interesting and I heard you
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:20.640]  mentioned yesterday and I just like to hear you and you know others in the
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:24.240]  media talk more about that Joe are you one of the guys in Army Intelligence I
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:32.520]  talked to yes I am Alex yeah I thought I recognized your voice well I mean for
[01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:35.120]  those that don't know that's in the Associated Press and I remember hearing
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.080]  that the time that they made a lot of people were erased their cell phone
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:41.000]  videos that's a big problem for the globalist because they want to use big
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.880]  brother to control us we can use it against them and the fact that they
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.120]  were running drills the fact that they were now we know for two years this
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.960]  lunatic thought he was communicating with Al Qaeda and sending it to a known
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:57.240]  Al Qaeda CIA handler and was talking about what he was gonna do that was violent
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:01.160]  and they knew this and left him alone and now you add making people erase cell
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:06.600]  phone videos and that's very suspicious isn't it absolutely I know around the
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.800]  situation like that there's there's gonna be a ton of confusion but at the same
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:14.040]  time you know as a non-commissioned officer I know better better than to
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.320]  destroy evidence of the crime yeah well that's a crime right there and the
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:22.160]  default is even if they classified it you don't destroy anything absolutely and
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:26.040]  you know most people in the military know and I just like to see some more
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:29.320]  news coverage on this and apparently when it was brought up the trial this
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:34.440]  CNN article that I read it was immediately just kind of dropped and I
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:37.920]  just well what other people in your intelligence unit I mean you told me
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.800]  they're already think something stinks there at Fort Hood but what do they
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:45.320]  think about this well we really don't know what to think I mean we're not
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.200]  obviously in the trial so we can't make too many judgments and you know just to
[01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:54.520]  be careful and protect myself you know I'm not gonna go out there and and make
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.760]  any speculations but stuff like this Alex when when this is you know
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:04.000]  basically brushed off it makes you wonder well Joe I appreciate you
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.280]  holding anything else you want to add about what's happening worldwide Alex
[01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:12.240]  you are one of the greatest Patriots we have in this country and you know I just
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:16.280]  I pray for you and yours every day and you need to continue on on your mission
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.680]  man and you know God bless you and all yours and you know I wish nothing but
[01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:24.400]  the best and we're gonna we're gonna win this someday we're gonna win it is
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.600]  there any talk on base how they're openly now announcing oh the troops
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.960]  just won't be used to fight al-Qaeda in America they'll be used during a
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:37.240]  financial collapse yeah well we we we read the army times and you know funny
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.440]  enough the army times covers it and you know some of this stuff you know the
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:46.880]  brigade homeland defense and everything else so we're well aware of our role
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:50.880]  but we're also well aware of the the oath we swore and that is protect the
[01:04:50.880 --> 01:04:55.600]  Constitution all right good good hearing from you Joe great info you gave us
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:05:02.160]  about stuff at Fort Hood over right back Alex told you the government announced
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:07.000]  recently that the recession is over it ended on June of 2009 the millions of
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:11.520]  Americans unable to find work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:14.920]  bankers and government employees but for the rest of us things seem to be

[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:40.960]  hi Alex I believe I may have found 9-11 evidence that you're not aware of yet
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:48.520]  okay tell me um this is a out of the Sarasota Sarasota Herald Tribune and if
[01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:54.600]  the article has to do with the missile being placed on the roof of the hotel
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:59.300]  the president was staying at the day before the 9-11 attacks now as far
[01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:04.160]  as I know you can get the primary source information if you go to the Sarasota
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:10.160]  Herald Tribune web page and you do a search for the article and you do the
[01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:16.960]  beginning and the end date search as September 10th 2002 and the keyword
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:22.640]  missile an article should come up talking about the town remembers a
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.400]  historical visit from a year ago okay town remembers historical visit from a
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:31.680]  year ago something like that okay town remembers historical visit from a year
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:38.640]  ago Sarasota Herald Tribune yes Sarasota we'll search that right now Sarasota
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:44.840]  Herald Tribune town remembers historic visit from president yeah but I think
[01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:49.920]  it'll work if you do a keyword search for missile and the dates on the Sarasota
[01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:54.640]  site all right we will look into that I know that it's customary to have missiles
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:10:00.120]  travel around with the president at least stingers I remember when Ronald
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.600]  Reagan came to speak in Dallas when I was a little kid and then the vice
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.880]  president he was running for president and my dad going look at those guys on
[01:10:07.880 --> 01:10:11.560]  the roof and they clearly had you know the box on the side and the tube and
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:14.920]  they had stinger missiles up on the roof it's come out in the news they have
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:19.480]  stingers at the White House they had bigger missile batteries and still do
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:25.000]  at the Pentagon but they stood down that day but we'll look into that John
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.840]  anything else no that should cover it thank you thank you so much good tip
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:33.920]  there let's talk to Noel in Illinois Noel you're on the air Alex I have a
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.840]  bunch of points so I'm gonna make it quick here at Western Illinois University
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.640]  we had those flu shots last week the big eugenics operation I kidded my
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:47.160]  broadcasting department took the fluorex vaccine from Glasgow Smith and Klein
[01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:52.720]  page 8 says you could receive tonsillitis the kid got tonsillitis so
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:57.600]  again the school not informing students about side effects in the vaccine
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:03.400]  quickly before I go to your question and you raise to the listeners today we
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.240]  someone we still need to do something about the Mockingbird media and their
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.480]  discrimination against Rand Paul they're committing libel and slander are
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:15.520]  both accounts I'm watching slime ball with Chris Matthews last night he has
[01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:20.080]  his opponent on going back to that GQ article and I remember you this summer
[01:11:20.080 --> 01:11:23.280]  telling telling us about the Washington Post article admitting that the lady
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.400]  falsified the story but continuing this up with two weeks left in the election
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:31.760]  it's disgusting the Mockingbird media should be ashamed of themselves for
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.840]  what they're doing to Rand Paul yeah they don't criticize politicians who are
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:39.680]  part of skull and bones or Bohemian Grove they go back 30 years ago and claim
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:43.200]  he kidnapped a woman and made her smoke marijuana and then she came out and
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:47.280]  said well no the media is exaggerating it was a frat party and everybody was
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.840]  acting stupid that's standard procedure and it's just all a lie and you know I
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:56.840]  knew they'd come back with stuff they're gonna probably two or three days
[01:11:56.840 --> 01:12:01.320]  before you know it's kind of like saying are you still beating your wife or are
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:04.440]  you still a murderer you still a bank robber even if you're not a murderer
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:10.200]  bank robber it's still just hangs out there you know against the person and
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:14.120]  yesterday I was watching just a few minutes of Fox and they were kind of
[01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:18.800]  bashing Rand Paul and but nobody listens to Chris Matthews I mean literally
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:23.880]  the guys maybe has 400,000 viewers I mean he's a joke folks this radio show
[01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:27.840]  every hour has more than that conservatively so I mean it's just all a
[01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:32.280]  big illusion and the fact that they are demonizing him I think may even help him
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.720]  in a way because people know the mainstream media are a pack of liars
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:40.160]  anything else no well yeah just just just everyone look up Alex Jones good
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:45.440]  running David Gergen with Bohemian Grove and then lastly Homeland Security the
[01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:50.600]  same people who run run Plum Island and the nasty things they do near Long
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:54.880]  Island are here at my university currently I took a video this I'm not
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.400]  sure what they're doing here it's the same Homeland Security with the right
[01:12:57.400 --> 01:13:02.120]  wing extremists they're indoctrinating the largest law enforcement school in
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:05.960]  the state of Illinois I will do my best to get more video of this but it's quite
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.280]  shocking everyone keep up the good work your money order for the money Bob Alex
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:12.920]  I'm donating some money to you it's in the mail you will receive it soon keep up

[01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.320]  much no well speaking of the money bomb to finish the studio to finish the
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:25.560]  social network to finish everything we're building 500,000 sounds like a

[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:37.280]  herald tribune and we were able to find that it is on their site but you but we
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:42.760]  also found a copy that was archived and it's the day before everything changed
[01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:48.360]  president bush touched local lives and it talks about the president stroll in the
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:54.720]  dining room at 7 p.m. after a flight aboard air force 1 and waiter was there
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.320]  to make sure he got whatever he needed and it goes on and then buried on page
[01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:06.760]  2 and it's highlighted it says a white house stage artists not teachers or
[01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:10.160]  students designed the childish decorations that were eventually put on the
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.920]  wall behind the president at the colony the secret service was getting
[01:16:14.920 --> 01:16:19.480]  everything secure for when the president arrived at september 10th that
[01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:23.480]  included snipers and service to air missiles on the roof of the coast guard
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:28.040]  patrolling just offshore so this is in florida so when he did the little goat
[01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.800]  story and all that all the fake decorations it was all a set the kids
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.120]  hadn't done that and there everybody's kept saying why is he standing down you
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:40.720]  know I know bush is corrupt and evil but more and more the evidence shows he
[01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:46.080]  was basically out of the loop cheney was in command of the stand down as norman
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:49.200]  panetta that had a transportation testified in congress and has since
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.080]  done four other TV interviews and said no cheney's lying about when we got word
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.120]  you know we got word about 45 minutes before he says we got word and I was
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:02.080]  there when he said the order still stands no air defense but this just shows
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:06.320]  how they had missiles and I know that happens a lot but people kept saying
[01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:09.040]  well why aren't they moving the president out you know you've got planes
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:12.240]  crashing in the world trade center a plane going down in pennsylvania
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:16.560]  normally they would get him out of there but he sat there for close to an hour
[01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:20.080]  just sat there while it was all unfolding on television and the secret
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.480]  service didn't say we have a security threat sir we've got to get you out of
[01:17:22.480 --> 01:17:25.200]  here I mean if there was a shooting five miles away in
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:28.400]  florida that day they would have gotten him out of there
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:31.840]  if there was a backfire in the street by a car they would have gotten him out of
[01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.400]  there but that day they sat there with the secret
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:37.600]  service and now that included snipers and service to air
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:41.600]  missiles on the roof of the coast guard patrolling just offshore surface to air
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:45.200]  so that surface to aircraft to shoot down aircraft
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:51.360]  very very interesting September 10th 2002 reporting on what happened a year
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.720]  before out of the Sarasota newspaper so a good tip from the listener on that
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:00.880]  front who's up next here
[01:18:01.520 --> 01:18:04.960]  pat in texas you're on the air thanks for holding
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:08.720]  hi alex um what i wanted to say was
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:16.560]  that i watched tv some but i sit there and watch all of this
[01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:22.320]  stuff about buying things you know it's totally like everything's normal
[01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.880]  and i can't figure out if they're totally ignorant
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:32.960]  or they're just i don't know what well they convince major corporations and
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:36.000]  others to play along with the confidence game of
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:40.160]  if we just act confident that'll make it better and then but the problem and to
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:43.440]  a certain extent that's true if you had a good government
[01:18:43.440 --> 01:18:47.200]  if you had good monetary policy we wouldn't be in this position a but b
[01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:50.480]  let's say we were in this position we could get out of it not without some
[01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.960]  painful things happening but a lot better than where we're going
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:56.560]  but they want to keep confidence going and then say don't worry the central
[01:18:56.560 --> 01:19:00.720]  banks have a solution a global government they control a global currency
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.640]  that all of the currencies are basically denominated in
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:08.320]  and so they just want to stall stall stall till the election then they'll
[01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:10.800]  announce that the economy is a lot worse than they'd said they're already doing it
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:14.000]  to a certain extent but then offer you their next solution
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:20.880]  yeah but it's almost realistic because i've told people for god knows how many
[01:19:20.880 --> 01:19:25.120]  years at least 10 to 15 years all of this is going on
[01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:28.480]  and they don't believe me because they watched tv
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:33.760]  well also things have been so good so long it can't happen here pat
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:37.120]  i guess so but it's hard to even convince my kids
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:40.880]  because every you know been doing so well and everything
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.680]  well this is still a wealthy country we've you know still a lot of great
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.120]  things it's just that the monetary changes being made are going to make
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:50.320]  things a lot worse pat great points dan laura dan

[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.640]  copy of it but just in case people don't believe that we were able to get into
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:23.520]  the heraldtribune's archive and find it

[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:38.160]  and it talks about service to air anti-aircraft missiles being put up

[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.800]  the reason i'm calling in today is this is kind of a question is directed
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:18.080]  towards uh... roberty at sake i know he's not on yet
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:22.160]  but there's a lot of talk here uh... in our networks about
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.000]  the iraqi denar about uh... using the denar
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:30.080]  as an investment tool and they're promising people
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:33.840]  not really promising that thing with the re-evaluation the denar that they
[01:25:33.840 --> 01:25:37.600]  could actually be uh... yeah i've got a lot of family that's in the military
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:40.240]  and all of them have bought a bunch of dinars
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:43.440]  thinking that they're going to go way up
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:48.080]  how and when i watch the videos of the bankers actually explaining
[01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:51.040]  where you need to turn in these denars after the re
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:54.880]  re-assessment of their value uh... they seem to be all located at federal
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:57.040]  reserve location
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.760]  i'm questioning uh... is this a means to actually help upload the economic
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:02.960]  system by
[01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:06.400]  by uh... you know having some
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:10.720]  some sense of run on the bank to go in and get your hundred thousand dollars
[01:26:10.720 --> 01:26:12.560]  after you invested in a hundred bucks
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:18.160]  for a thousand dollars well well you know
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:21.920]  you know tens of billions of dollars were flown in on c-130s
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:25.920]  and paid off the locals in iraq and they would pay off even low-level officers
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:29.520]  and then say later hey you took a hundred thousand you took fifty thousand
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:31.920]  in us dollars you better keep your mouth shut
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:35.200]  when investigators come in here it's a way to corrupt everybody
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:38.640]  uh... but i don't think the investment i don't know what it is
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:43.120]  by military personnel in dinars it i don't even know if it's gonna go up
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.960]  i think it was a speculative thing but if it does
[01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:50.080]  that is a weird way to you know raise some money for the troops and usually
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.640]  the government doesn't want to do that
[01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:56.720]  unless it's to corrupt them so i don't know what's going to happen but i uh...
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.480]  i can't imagine how that would cause a run on the bank if you know if troops
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:02.640]  can go in and turn in their dinars
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.920]  now this isn't the alex assistant for the truth this is running through all our
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:08.640]  social networks all the mlm network
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.680]  uh... i've never seen something explode so quickly
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.880]  uh... people are just throwing their money in uh... buying iraqi dinars
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:21.120]  and i suppose supposedly the story is it's supposed to reevaluate by the end
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:22.320]  of the month
[01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:25.120]  and uh... people saying they could they could turn their
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.560]  going to turn in their small investment into a hundred thousand dollars
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:31.680]  well i know that started with the military and it just it just sounds
[01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:33.040]  like
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.160]  it i mean i i'll tell you i haven't invested but i got a few family
[01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.240]  members who begin or were in iraq and
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:40.560]  you know they bought some i don't think it was a lot
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:43.760]  and i know they're i remember hearing about this five years ago
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:46.400]  you know when they got some you know they put it in a safety deposit box
[01:27:46.400 --> 01:27:48.240]  hoping it goes up i mean i don't know
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:50.960]  i think we're going to find out soon though
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:55.200]  yes i mean msnbc was actually commentators physically holding up the
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.160]  nards thing i guess i've bought my dinars
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.280]  uh... this was just recently uh... so if anyone wants to investigate it you
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:07.360]  simply have to research uh... dinars uh... google dinars
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.480]  the other quick question i have for you is nisera
[01:28:10.480 --> 01:28:13.840]  uh... we have a lot of people talking in not real about
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:16.560]  not real real at all yeah the national
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:19.840]  restabilization act i've been hearing about it for 15 years
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:23.200]  it's made up and they get all these people to invest in the false reality
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:26.720]  that secretly the government's good everything's been reorganized
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:30.240]  everything's fine it's kind of like christians are told we're about to be
[01:28:30.240 --> 01:28:33.520]  raptured so don't fight corruption and it's just totally
[01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:37.040]  false and we're always hearing they're gonna announce next month nisera
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.480]  and it never happens it's a complete baloney
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:44.080]  complete scam uh... yeah i mean there are a lot of well-meaning idiots out promoting
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:47.520]  it but it's not real okay
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:51.120]  alright thanks but i mean you know as they reorganize the country and other
[01:28:51.120 --> 01:28:55.200]  nations into this police state i am i can see them saying oh look it's the
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:59.680]  reorganization we're free i mean it's just it's just
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:02.320]  it's like all these stories you hear about there's a guy in london he's got a
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:05.520]  hundred billion you know but he but the government took it from him and if you'll
[01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:08.640]  just invest with him when he gets the hundred billion you'll get part of it
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:13.040]  it's basically like a bigger more blown up
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:17.920]  uh... gargantuan version of those nigeria emails you get
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:24.080]  and everybody gets them where oh i am prince babu and if you give me a ten
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:27.680]  thousand dollars i'm about to get fifty million i will give you one million

[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:11.040]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:14.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:18.880]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:22.080]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.720]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:28.640]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:32.160]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.280]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:31:35.280 --> 01:31:38.400]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:08.960]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:11.680]  agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:14.880]  and government employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be getting

[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:59.680]  with obama whether your issue is health care
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:05.200]  taxation social security um anti-war worthy of
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:11.040]  because obama is not constitutionally eligible to be president
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:15.680]  and if enough people turn out we can force the issue force obama to show us
[01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:19.600]  that he's constitutionally eligible which he's not and therefore it was a
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.920]  demand that he resigned from office and if enough people show up we can force
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:27.680]  the actual media to cover this story once and for all which they won't
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.280]  we can force congress maybe they have one hearing if they would have one hearing
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.120]  obama would be out of well resistance is victory and
[01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:39.440]  uh people need to call the media in the east coast area especially dc and
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:42.560]  maryland and tell them to be there to cover this
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.240]  absolutely but as many people because the foreign press
[01:37:46.240 --> 01:37:49.360]  is already covering it they've contacted me
[01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:52.320]  they'll be there and we'll come back to the united states but the important
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:56.480]  thing is we have to put pressure on because the national media and members
[01:37:56.480 --> 01:38:00.320]  of congress are gutless they have no guts to challenge this issue
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:03.520]  and there's nothing more important than our us constitution
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:06.880]  so it's really imperative that everyone come out and support this issue
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.480]  and we can get obama out of office because he doesn't belong there
[01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:13.920]  he's constitutionally not eligible to be president
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:18.720]  he's not natural born he was born in africa i'm tired of their nonsense of
[01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.720]  showing that certification of live birth which they say is a birth certificate
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.160]  it's not a birth certificate it doesn't have it well regardless
[01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:28.560]  and i think the evidence is clear on that but it's a hundred percent on the
[01:38:28.560 --> 01:38:32.400]  berries of tarot giving up his citizenship to become indonesian and
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:35.680]  that makes him ineligible under the law to be president
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:40.000]  absolutely and and we have on our website a copy of the school record
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:45.280]  where his name is bari sotoro um and he mentioned that in his autobiography
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.200]  that his stepfather lolo sotoro returned to indonesia before he
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.600]  so with his name is bari sotoro it says his nationality is indonesia
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:57.920]  and his religion is islam which is muslim there's no question he's not
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:39:00.800]  qualified he hasn't produced any documentation
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:05.680]  he spent over 1.6 million dollars trading my three lawsuits and another 50 to 100
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:08.880]  lawsuits around the country spend that kind of money
[01:39:08.880 --> 01:39:14.640]  unless you're hiding something and and and and now releasing his passport
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:20.560]  which is recent as if that's proof of his citizenship as if we're that stupid
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:25.040]  absolutely and the best is there's a recording around of michelle obama
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.520]  saying you know we went to obama's home home land in kenyon that would they
[01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:33.200]  got a flu shot i believe over there but in their own
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.080]  mouth or own words she reiterates the fact that well phil phil she said that
[01:39:38.080 --> 01:39:40.880]  repeatedly and we're going to cue that up and play it but i i don't want to sit
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:45.120]  here in bascalin back because you know i'm tired of it and i don't want to do it
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:48.240]  uh because i think in a lot of places he's doing more more harm than good but i
[01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.360]  saw him three weeks ago because we're making a film about the tea party so
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.280]  we're watching it every day and studying it
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:58.000]  i saw him say with no proof he just said look you want a real
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:02.640]  you know he says everything i covers a real conspiracy he goes what isn't real
[01:40:02.640 --> 01:40:07.600]  is that obama was born in kenya it's a lie it's not true he said that's it
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:12.000]  it's not true and he said hillary clinton created this line
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:15.360]  now i know you're a democrat and i know you're one of the first people to
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:20.240]  criticize him but it doesn't matter the facts are the facts that he's indonesian
[01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:23.680]  citizen and the facts are the systems getting
[01:40:23.680 --> 01:40:28.320]  desperate when they're coming out and saying this is a hillary clinton
[01:40:28.320 --> 01:40:31.120]  operation i don't believe that that's why you did this
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:34.480]  a lot of other republicans did it right around the same time as you but can you
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:38.880]  speak to aglain back just with no evidence saying none of it's true
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:44.320]  a and how desperate the system is and b uh you know this charge
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:48.000]  that basically this is hillary clinton doing this what hillary is part of his
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:51.840]  administration well first of all i i don't understand glenn
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:55.200]  back because he said 90 percent of his time is against
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:58.480]  obama but he won't touch the birth certificate issue and i think that's
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:02.320]  from pressure on high for this thing to discuss anything except the birth
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:05.120]  certificate issue so they don't do that it's not a story
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:08.000]  clinton thing you know people say that that i
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.400]  be the supporter i supported her i gave her like 200 bucks i maybe gave her 10
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.680]  hours of my time no way was i involved
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:19.280]  actively really with her campaign and no way
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:22.480]  did she tell me what to do on this well you talked about this over two years ago
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.600]  on this show you said i'm a democrat i'm concerned
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:28.880]  i'm worried about them running somebody that isn't a citizen this is going to
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.960]  cause a constitutional crisis absolutely and i'm doing this
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:36.480]  you know they keep saying it's a right-wing conspiracy as you stated
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:41.840]  i am a lifelong democrat and then they say uh you're a racist and i say well
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:45.360]  i'm white jewish but i'm also paid a placement of the NAACP
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:49.280]  they don't know what to do with me and i'm glad because i'm leading this fight
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:52.880]  for the citizens of this country we deserve to know the truth
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:56.640]  obama with obama care is is unconstitutional
[01:41:56.640 --> 01:42:00.400]  um the other situation is he's unconstitutional and he's trying to
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:03.840]  destroy this country he's ready to have a conference set up on
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:08.160]  social security and two of the people that have been named to be on that
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.880]  have already said they want to do it away with social security we
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:14.160]  know they've already proposed taking over even
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:17.600]  uh public and private pension funds and taxing them
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:22.720]  i mean i mean they're really doing this well that's that's dangerous that's
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.800]  very dangerous it really is you know well let's talk more about them i mean
[01:42:26.800 --> 01:42:30.240]  specifically though how can glenn beck just come out knowing
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:33.840]  that most of his listeners i mean what is it 60 something percent of republicans
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:37.760]  think he wasn't born here uh it's 30 something percent of democrats i want
[01:42:37.760 --> 01:42:41.920]  to play this michelle saturo excuse me michelle obama
[01:42:41.920 --> 01:42:48.000]  uh a clip uh a very saturo's wife michelle saturo clip and this is before
[01:42:48.000 --> 01:42:51.040]  any of this stuff came out this is two years ago there's several of these
[01:42:51.040 --> 01:42:55.440]  clips uh giving a speech to democrats talking about
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:58.960]  how going back to his home country of kenya now it doesn't get any more
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:03.040]  powerful than this here it is surrounding hiv testing which is
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:07.600]  still plaguing so many of our communities uh which you all know a lot
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:12.320]  of that is due to homophobia uh barack has led by example
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:16.320]  when we took our trip to africa and visited his home country
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:22.960]  in kenya uh we took a public hiv test uh for the very point of showing
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:27.360]  okay folks in kenya that there is nothing i mean and then there's more clips
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:30.720]  ever but we're not supposed to be concerned about this or his grandmother
[01:43:30.720 --> 01:43:33.840]  saying he was born there or the kenyan press saying he was born there or
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:38.160]  them having a statue saying he was born there but but again i i bypass all that
[01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:40.400]  because they can at least cloud the issue
[01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:45.360]  he gave up his citizenship to become barry saturo it's on record phil
[01:43:45.360 --> 01:43:49.920]  i know i know and that's why what we have to do for all your listeners out
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:53.680]  there when the show is over go to your address book
[01:43:53.680 --> 01:43:57.440]  send them my website obamacrime.com spread it
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:00.960]  if enough people in this country really knew what was going on
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:04.160]  then at that point i think we can reinforce the issue
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:08.160]  that's the thing not enough people know and really we need a big turnout
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.800]  we need a big turnout this coming Saturday and as many people please urge
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:18.240]  everyone to to come it's a play-doh how long have you had to promote this
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:22.000]  um we've been doing for the past month but uh you know it's tough the national
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000]  media won't cover it and um
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:29.520]  you know we're doing it by radio we're doing wherever we can we're doing it by
[01:44:29.520 --> 01:44:32.560]  the internet we're doing it by you you're a great
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.920]  uh sponsor i i know you can uh support this and send the message out to people
[01:44:37.920 --> 01:44:41.600]  and um we need as many people as we can if we can get
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:45.040]  more people there the more people the better you know uh
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:50.640]  alex within um two to three hours of uh i'm sorry yeah within two to three
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:54.880]  hours of uh washington dc there's about 30
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:57.760]  million people we just need people to take off
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:45:02.320]  a half day of your time this can be the most effective march in the history of
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:06.960]  this country because we deserve the truth and we're not getting it
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:10.720]  well we need everybody to call their local talk radio especially if you're
[01:45:10.720 --> 01:45:14.960]  near dc within you know even 200 miles call talk radio
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:18.320]  plug the obama crimes website say there's a rally
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:22.480]  exposing all this and obama care coming up this weekend
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:25.600]  everybody needs to be there saturday october 23rd
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:30.320]  2010 high noon for three hours tell us about some of the speakers you've got
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:33.680]  coming up bill well i think uh most of the biggest
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:36.480]  speaker for everyone's concern is that jerry corsey
[01:45:36.480 --> 01:45:41.040]  because jerry corsey uh traveled he's been doing this with world that daily
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:45.200]  and jerry corsey um as you know uh went to africa
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.720]  and the entire time he was there they put him on house arrest
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:52.160]  house arrest he couldn't get to her and that's the crucial person
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:55.920]  zero obama because zero obama state she was there
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:45:59.120]  she was there when he was born just in the hospital i mean
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:03.280]  this thing is such a host on our country and uh we're gonna have to
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.040]  hopefully we're gonna have the uh minister there who was on the call
[01:46:07.040 --> 01:46:11.440]  where um the tape was taken with zero obama and swahili
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:14.640]  where she stated he was there we're hoping to have him there and other
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:18.720]  speakers but the crucial thing is we need people there
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:22.880]  this is so important bring a copy of your birth certificate i can imagine a
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:26.160]  million people holding up a copy of their birth certificate
[01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:30.160]  and then saying to obama show us that you're constitutionally eligible show us
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:34.240]  the vault copy listen now they've digitized all this
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:37.040]  and i've had children and i needed to get extra copies of it
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.200]  and you go down to the bureau statistics and they print you a receipt
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:45.520]  that is not the vault copy signed by the doctor i know our listeners know this
[01:46:45.520 --> 01:46:49.840]  but the media but look here's the good news fill uh the hoax isn't working
[01:46:49.840 --> 01:46:53.040]  he he you know going back a year ago he had the lowest approval rating of any
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:56.080]  president at that point now it's broken all records
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:02.160]  and they're talking about obama may not even run now the republicans are
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:05.520]  going to win the house and the senate i mean this guy has been a total
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:08.800]  disaster because he's as phony as a three dollar bill
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:12.720]  and he can't even talk unless he has a teleprompter
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.200]  the white house admits all he does is watch espn he's basically delusional
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:20.480]  because he's an actor he's an actor he's an actor
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:26.880]  he's an actor and if we can bring down barry sataro aka barack obama
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:30.480]  it's all the stuff he's put through legislatively is over
[01:47:30.480 --> 01:47:34.560]  can you as a lawyer and a constitutional expert explain that to him
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:38.000]  yeah i mean here's the thing people talking about impeaches you can impeach
[01:47:38.000 --> 01:47:41.920]  someone who's not legally in office here we can force them out of office and
[01:47:41.920 --> 01:47:44.640]  everything this is so urgent so important for all of you
[01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.160]  because everything he's done would become void because it's all voidable now
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.880]  because he has no business being in that office
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:54.640]  and you know that the sad thing is he knows it he knows it
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.280]  and like you know people are saying well you know if you get him out of office
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:00.560]  it'll be rioted in the streets there's not to be rioted in the street because i
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:03.280]  will have a news conference with all the major
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:07.440]  um religious people in this country the major talk show people in this country
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:11.440]  and the major politicians say stop in your crap you're gonna have a riot in
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:14.320]  the streets for obama but obama knows that he
[01:48:14.320 --> 01:48:18.720]  perpetrated this this is non-status well look i saw a poll that over 34
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:21.280]  percent of his original supporters have now left him
[01:48:21.280 --> 01:48:24.720]  i mean you're not going to have a riot over this unless somebody stages it
[01:48:24.720 --> 01:48:28.800]  but plus justice be done may the heavens fall phil
[01:48:28.800 --> 01:48:32.640]  absolutely but this is so that's why when you say the lack of support he has
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:36.800]  therefore the people that are anti-obama this is the rally to come out to
[01:48:36.800 --> 01:48:40.000]  whatever you are with republican democrat independent
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:43.600]  whatever your tea party some of the party people don't want to test this
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:48.000]  issue because they have their own issue my issue is that it's constitutional
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.920]  crisis we're in well the tea party was started out of ron paul then
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:55.360]  a year and a half ago all the first tea parties were about the birth
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:59.120]  certificates everybody being shouted down and then beck comes in as our leader
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:03.120]  and says you don't touch the issue that supercharged the tea party
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:06.720]  who and i don't want to bash him anymore but come on beck
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:10.320]  don't sit there and tell us what we can and can't talk about
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:14.560]  and now the tea party is so in his lap that and
[01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:18.080]  that is that that they're not good this is outrageous
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.520]  given the top officials are not even out with us but they
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.200]  down the people out there the constitution says we the people
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:28.880]  and members of the tea party and members of republican democrats are
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:33.360]  independent you can unite with us on this issue i'm doing this is now my
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.120]  27th month doing this i did this before he even ran

[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:09.520]  by getting enough people out there and forcing congress to hold a hearing
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:13.920]  or forcing the national media to cover the story if this story was covered by

[01:56:04.640 --> 01:56:10.160]  wasn't born there why act so suspicious and also why steal all your records
[01:56:10.160 --> 01:56:13.200]  all his records are sealed it was one of the first acts he did

[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:00.880]  fire but as you have shown it's barry sataro the
[01:58:00.880 --> 01:58:04.240]  fact that he gave up his citizenship and his illegitimate on that front

[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:11.760]  and clearly the kenya situation you know all the evidence is he was born in

[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:24.480]  here today and robert good to have you here with us
[02:01:24.480 --> 02:01:26.960]  hey thank you i'm honored to be on your program
[02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:30.880]  well honored to have you well this is a short segment but just you told everybody
[02:01:30.880 --> 02:01:33.440]  what was going to happen how did you know
[02:01:33.440 --> 02:01:36.800]  and what did you say was going to unfold and where are we going from here
[02:01:36.800 --> 02:01:41.520]  well the pieces came together back in 1972 i was a marine corps pilot flying
[02:01:41.520 --> 02:01:45.520]  over vietnam and i saw the vietnamese people panicking
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:49.360]  and they wouldn't accept us dollars and they wouldn't accept piasta their
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:52.880]  currency and all they wanted was gold and i knew
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:57.280]  something was up at that point and over the years the pieces just kept coming
[02:01:57.280 --> 02:02:01.040]  together so that's where it started for me
[02:02:01.040 --> 02:02:04.160]  that's when you really started to learn how monetary systems really work
[02:02:04.160 --> 02:02:07.440]  well the pieces like i said i wish i could say i knew i mean even today as
[02:02:07.440 --> 02:02:10.560]  much as i know they still it's still smoking mirrors as far as i'm
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.240]  concerned absolutely but going back this is the
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:17.280]  last five six years you've predicted exactly what's happening now
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:20.720]  yeah well that's not hard to do i mean all you do is listen to what
[02:02:20.720 --> 02:02:23.520]  greenspan was saying and vernac he was saying and
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:27.120]  clinton and bush and you kind of get the idea that you're being you know it's
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:31.200]  grouped so it wasn't that hard to figure it out it's just
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:34.960]  i think the toughest thing for people is what can i do what can i as an
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:39.520]  individual do and i think that's where my company rich dad
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:43.760]  comes in as we teach people how to avoid the pitfalls
[02:02:43.760 --> 02:02:49.520]  of falling prey to the ultra rich you know
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:54.160]  let's get into falling prey to the ultra rich this system they've created to
[02:02:54.160 --> 02:02:57.040]  destroy our wealth and transfer to themselves then we'll get into your
[02:02:57.040 --> 02:03:00.320]  solutions after the break but when you talk about falling prey to them how
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:02.400]  how are people falling prey to them what are their
[02:03:02.400 --> 02:03:06.800]  what are their traps they're laying well the idea of saving money that's
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:11.200]  ridiculous after after 71 when nixon broke the brett woods agreement and
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:15.200]  put us on the dollar standard not the gold standard
[02:03:15.200 --> 02:03:18.320]  that anybody who was saving money was the biggest loser
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:22.240]  and in 1974 the government passed orisa
[02:03:22.240 --> 02:03:28.320]  employee retirement employment income security act and the
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.760]  reason they did that as best i can tell is because
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:35.760]  my general my father's generation the world war two generation wasn't in the
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.920]  stock market because they got hammered during the great depression so guys like
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:42.640]  my dad you know he wouldn't go into the stock
[02:03:42.640 --> 02:03:47.200]  market so in 74 they passed orisa which is now the 401k
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:51.120]  and now they require most employees to put their money
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:55.600]  into a mutual fund and i don't know if you know the ratio but
[02:03:55.600 --> 02:04:00.160]  john bogel of vanguard says you put up 100 percent of the money you take 100
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:03.200]  percent of the risk and they take 80 percent of the profits
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:07.360]  and this compounding expenses this rips the little guy apart so they don't have
[02:04:07.360 --> 02:04:10.720]  a prayer for their retirement but they have all these well-paid
[02:04:10.720 --> 02:04:14.400]  pitchmen out there to give people you know the illusion that they're making a
[02:04:14.400 --> 02:04:17.680]  smart investment right and then what happens in our schools is
[02:04:17.680 --> 02:04:21.120]  the bankers go to the school to tell your kids to save money
[02:04:21.120 --> 02:04:26.400]  at the same time the fred may know obama printed what 1.9 trillion
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:29.760]  and then they keep telling you to invest for the long term
[02:04:29.760 --> 02:04:33.440]  in the stock market and as you know long-term investors for the last 10
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:37.840]  years have made zero they've actually lost money but gold's up four fold though
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:41.200]  they try to suppress it uh robert kiyosaki rich dad

[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:29.280]  the ultra rich have set up a scam to transfer your
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:32.800]  wealth to them he's going to go over the different types of
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:36.560]  corruption and manipulation that are going on and then ways to avoid this
[02:09:36.560 --> 02:09:40.000]  and protect yourself he is charted and chronicled and predicted
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:43.520]  everything we see unfolding today and that's the type of guest we have on
[02:09:43.520 --> 02:09:48.640]  not all the big paid for mercenaries financial mercenaries on tv and radio
[02:09:48.640 --> 02:09:53.120]  that give you disinfo we have people on who've got a track record of being
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:56.720]  accurate and he's one of the most accurate out there rich dad dot com
[02:09:56.720 --> 02:09:59.040]  again our websites are info wars dot com and
[02:09:59.040 --> 02:10:02.560]  prison planet dot tv robert you started getting into
[02:10:02.560 --> 02:10:05.600]  some of the ways they transfer our wealth let's go over that and then ways to
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:08.640]  protect ourselves and then where you see this society
[02:10:08.640 --> 02:10:13.120]  and economy going robert well when you say to your child go to school
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:17.040]  get good grades and get a safe secure job the moment you've done that
[02:10:17.040 --> 02:10:20.480]  you've programmed to pay taxes at that point
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:24.640]  so the harder you work the higher percentage in taxes
[02:10:24.640 --> 02:10:28.960]  you pay and then they tell you to save money and the problem with saving money
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:33.680]  as you know from the you know the fractional reserve system
[02:10:33.680 --> 02:10:37.680]  the fed and the treasury allowed to print money so your money is devalued
[02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:41.200]  in in the savings plan the third when they print money
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:45.040]  you're eaten alive by inflation and you can see inflation creeping up at food
[02:10:45.040 --> 02:10:48.000]  right now and then the fourth way is they tell you
[02:10:48.000 --> 02:10:51.760]  to put it into a retirement plan filled with mutual funds stocks bonds and
[02:10:51.760 --> 02:10:56.720]  things like that and what happens is the taxes go
[02:10:56.720 --> 02:11:01.760]  against the person who does that but also their money is
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:04.960]  flowing to the rich now i don't i'm not saying it's wrong
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:08.400]  because you know every coin has two sides
[02:11:08.400 --> 02:11:11.440]  so the money is always flowing to guys like me
[02:11:11.440 --> 02:11:15.040]  so when i write rich dad poor dad and all this i'm saying look
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:20.960]  that money in savings is going to me your money in your 401k is going to me
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:24.800]  and when you pay taxes that money goes to me and i do mean me
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:29.120]  so that's why i wrote rich dad poor dad was to wake people up and say look
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:32.800]  you only have basically two choices you're either going to
[02:11:32.800 --> 02:11:36.960]  make the money or have your money stolen and that's the system
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:40.560]  is terrible well earlier you were talking about
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:47.280]  the pension funds and the ratio and 401ks the mutual funds now they're openly
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:49.760]  this is already happening in europe it's called austerity
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:54.800]  where almost all the taxes we pay goes to serve as a debt that they made out of
[02:11:54.800 --> 02:11:58.480]  nothing via fractional reserve banking and now the derivative scan that even
[02:11:58.480 --> 02:12:03.680]  leverages it further and we know that now they're
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.600]  announcing oh we're going to save social security by raising the tax
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:10.560]  we're going to save your private pension fund your 401k
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:15.440]  by taking it and putting a tax on it and so now as people get ready to retire
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:18.800]  and record amounts magically they're changing the system
[02:12:18.800 --> 02:12:22.400]  to steal most of that as well and then through government-run health care
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:25.600]  they make you pay into the system i mean it's incredible
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:29.200]  it's fascism is what it is it's not even socialism anymore
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.560]  you know fascism was like what the government does it at the point of a
[02:12:32.560 --> 02:12:36.080]  gun to force you to do the thing yes and that's what
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:39.920]  that's what you know i fought in vietnam twice
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:44.080]  and i didn't fight for fascism or socialism i fought for capitalism
[02:12:44.080 --> 02:12:47.840]  and i think that's what's being robbed from us it's a free capitalist
[02:12:47.840 --> 02:12:52.160]  society go through the basics and talk about some of your new books conspiracy
[02:12:52.160 --> 02:12:55.920]  of the rich eight ways the eight new rules of money and an unfair
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:13:00.400]  advantage on one of the newest books but i mean go through specifically then
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:03.600]  quantify what you mean by when you pay taxes it goes to
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:08.880]  you know ben Bernanke uh when you pay uh when you make money they get it so
[02:13:08.880 --> 02:13:11.680]  something i mean how do you make money and keep it explain that
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:14.960]  well let me explain there's always two sides to a coin i've never seen a one
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:21.040]  sided coin yet so the tax laws are really designed to
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:24.640]  make the rich richer the problem is if you go to
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:28.480]  school and get a job will become a doctor or a lawyer the tax
[02:13:28.480 --> 02:13:34.800]  then flows to the rich so a guy like me i have never made i have made more money
[02:13:34.800 --> 02:13:40.000]  in the last three years 2007 to 2010 tax free
[02:13:40.000 --> 02:13:45.840]  and so debt and taxes work with those with financial education
[02:13:45.840 --> 02:13:50.320]  debt and taxes work against those without financial education
[02:13:50.320 --> 02:13:54.240]  so you go to harvard or oxford and all this and still know nothing
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:58.960]  about debt and taxes i am millions of dollars in debt but that
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:04.080]  debt makes me rich tax free and that's where financial education kicks in
[02:14:04.080 --> 02:14:07.120]  this stuff they teach kids to put your money in a mutual fund
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:10.400]  i'm glad they do that because that's where i get my money from
[02:14:10.400 --> 02:14:14.960]  that's the really the two second side of the coin okay explain that to people
[02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:18.800]  well there's two kinds of people you have to park your money which is savings
[02:14:18.800 --> 02:14:22.000]  and pensions and people who move their money just in
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:25.520]  in my world of finance is called the velocity of money
[02:14:25.520 --> 02:14:30.080]  i want my money back as soon as possible so i can buy another asset and i mean
[02:14:30.080 --> 02:14:34.240]  an asset not sponsored mutual funds so i'm constantly
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:37.920]  moving my money and what the system the banking system
[02:14:37.920 --> 02:14:43.120]  does is programs you to park your money so you put it into savings and you
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:46.480]  you know they save save save save and then you put it in a
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:51.280]  retirement plan let's say starting at 25 and you hope it's there at 65
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:54.800]  i do not do that and a financial education would
[02:14:54.800 --> 02:14:59.200]  teach you how debt and taxes make the rich richer
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:02.960]  and that's all insane to people when i wrote rich dad poured out i said your
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:06.800]  house is not an asset it's the bank's asset
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:10.720]  if you could wake up to that oh no no you don't know what you're talking about
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:14.400]  and now we have people who are walking away from their mortgages because the
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:18.720]  mortgage is worth more than the house and that's what a little financial
[02:15:18.720 --> 02:15:22.960]  education these guys wouldn't be able to brainwash you
[02:15:22.960 --> 02:15:26.240]  with these i'm not saying they're good or bad people i'm saying if you don't
[02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:30.960]  know someone's gonna pick your pocket and and and your books quantify that down
[02:15:30.960 --> 02:15:34.160]  to find detail but but give people the basics as they're saying well what is
[02:15:34.160 --> 02:15:38.480]  this robert uh you know talking about what is he saying
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:42.640]  here uh i mean tell us what you do with your money and and
[02:15:42.640 --> 02:15:46.000]  what the rich do with their money okay first of all there's two books people
[02:15:46.000 --> 02:15:49.200]  should read if they want to understand rich dad rich dad poured out was really
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:52.080]  the basics and rich dad poured out is a book on
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:56.960]  accounting but it sold 24 million copies because it
[02:15:56.960 --> 02:16:01.920]  explains what our school system does a t-shirt even in accounting classes
[02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:05.920]  and the second book is a book called the cash flow quadrant and the quadrant is
[02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:08.800]  the four people that make up the world of money
[02:16:08.800 --> 02:16:13.760]  the e quadrant stands for employees so you could be a ceo or a janitor
[02:16:13.760 --> 02:16:17.760]  the trouble with the e quadrant is that's the highest the second highest tax
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:22.480]  of all the quadrants that started in 1940 through the current tax payment act
[02:16:22.480 --> 02:16:26.400]  which went against the constitution and they could tax they
[02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:30.160]  the government got paid before the employee got paid
[02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:33.920]  now the next quadrant is the s quadrant which stands for small business
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:37.600]  self-employed or specialist like a doctoral lawyer
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:41.040]  the tax laws changed for them in 1986
[02:16:41.040 --> 02:16:45.040]  with the tax reform act and they were just you know that was part of the rig
[02:16:45.040 --> 02:16:47.360]  and thing they were trying to collect more taxes
[02:16:47.360 --> 02:16:51.680]  on the right side of the quadrant there's b and b stands for big business
[02:16:51.680 --> 02:16:55.920]  500 employees or more and i stands for investor
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:16:59.360]  there's an investor class now many people invest like they invest
[02:16:59.360 --> 02:17:03.360]  in a mutual fund but they're not they invest but they're not
[02:17:03.360 --> 02:17:07.440]  investors investors are pure capitalists because they're
[02:17:07.440 --> 02:17:12.240]  always raising capital so for a guy like me since i have more than 500
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:15.840]  employees and i'm always raising capital via
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:20.400]  debt and things like that i pay no tax see if you look at the tax
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:27.120]  code the internal revenue tax code most of the code is how to avoid taxes
[02:17:27.120 --> 02:17:30.800]  but the trouble is if you go to school and you're talked by the socialist of the
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:34.960]  school system they're actually teaching you to be the proletariat
[02:17:34.960 --> 02:17:39.360]  the working class working for the bourgeois the rich
[02:17:39.360 --> 02:17:42.800]  and i don't want to be bourgeois i just want to be a capitalist
[02:17:42.800 --> 02:17:46.480]  i don't want to pay all that tax see the government needs guys like me who
[02:17:46.480 --> 02:17:50.480]  provides jobs and i have large apartment houses
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:55.840]  and i have oil wells i produce constantly so the tax laws are written for me
[02:17:55.840 --> 02:17:59.600]  except the school system doesn't tell you about the other side of the coin so
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:03.440]  how do how are you you know physically you know live in nice houses have a lot
[02:18:03.440 --> 02:18:08.480]  of money sell you know tens of millions of books but then not pay any taxes
[02:18:08.480 --> 02:18:12.800]  well because debt and taxes are written for people on the B and the i side of
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:17.440]  the quadrant you see you have to when 1973 i came back
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:22.320]  from vietnam i was a marine helicopter pilot went down three times i refuse to
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:25.520]  fight anymore i'd had it because i knew i was being lied to by my
[02:18:25.520 --> 02:18:29.120]  government so i come home and i asked my poor dad the head of
[02:18:29.120 --> 02:18:33.120]  education what should i do he says why don't you go fly for the airlines i said
[02:18:33.120 --> 02:18:36.480]  well then i become a pawn of the system
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:40.240]  so if i went to listen to my rich dad and became an entrepreneur because i did
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:43.600]  understand a little bit about tax incentives and
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:47.280]  investing up like this so i took up real estate courses
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:50.720]  starting in 1973 because you have to learn to manage debt
[02:18:50.720 --> 02:18:54.640]  because as you know is after 71 that the dollar became
[02:18:54.640 --> 02:19:00.400]  debt so you have to learn to manage debt so today i borrow millions of dollars
[02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:03.440]  tax-free i buy these apartment houses
[02:19:03.440 --> 02:19:09.200]  they're 100 finance and i've done this most of my life i have no equity into
[02:19:09.200 --> 02:19:13.360]  the property and the more i use bank money opm
[02:19:13.360 --> 02:19:17.120]  the less i pay in taxes then i get things like depreciation
[02:19:17.120 --> 02:19:21.920]  amortization and those other tax incentives because i provide
[02:19:21.920 --> 02:19:25.040]  large apartment houses because the government needs
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:29.600]  housing for people also i get tax incentives for oil production
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:34.240]  i don't buy oil stocks like i would never touch exxon or bp shares
[02:19:34.240 --> 02:19:37.920]  what i want is a percentage of the production
[02:19:37.920 --> 02:19:42.640]  so the prices of oil go up i make more money it goes down i still make money
[02:19:42.640 --> 02:19:46.320]  because the moment let's say i invest a hundred thousand dollars in oil
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:49.280]  production i get a 28 return on my capital
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:53.680]  instantaneously tell you what stay there let's continue to quantify this
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:20:00.960]  well with robert kiyosaki of rich dad dot com i'm alex jones of prisonplotted.com stay with us
[02:20:00.960 --> 02:20:04.240]  most americans believe famine and hunger will never happen
[02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:08.640]  but what if day one mayhem breaks out at grocery stores
[02:20:08.640 --> 02:20:14.880]  day three families are on edge day five the neighbors come knocking
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:19.360]  day ten small bands of thieves begin stealing at gunpoint
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:26.480]  day 15 desperation but the government can't help because there's no food left

[02:21:05.360 --> 02:21:08.800]  what have we got a republic or a monarchy
[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:12.560]  a republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:16.800]  not democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner

[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:13.200]  person who can't buy oil well operations or drilling operations
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:17.360]  the average person who can't buy be a big apartment houses
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:19.920]  and most people actually know in austin you've done well over time that's
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:24.000]  exactly what they do do what does the average person start doing
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:27.360]  to get in the right quadrant that's a great question
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:31.920]  um my whole shit is why don't we have financial education or a school
[02:24:31.920 --> 02:24:35.280]  you see that's where it starts and that's where the brainwashing begins
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:39.600]  and you talk about info when i was in public school that's all they taught
[02:24:39.600 --> 02:24:44.400]  me was how great 401ks i'm sorry you said that's where the info war starts
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:48.880]  now it's like you know the NEA the national education association forms
[02:24:48.880 --> 02:24:55.200]  called the national extortion association and they really are agents
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:59.120]  of the ultra risk to prevent people from knowing
[02:24:59.120 --> 02:25:04.400]  how the tax and debt systems work so all i did was having a rich dad who didn't
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:06.960]  go to school it's my best friend's father
[02:25:06.960 --> 02:25:09.680]  it's like he's he kind of helped me crack the code
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:14.320]  and i began to understand why you know why there's no financial education in
[02:25:14.320 --> 02:25:17.200]  our schools why did they try and control the
[02:25:17.200 --> 02:25:21.200]  media all the time and i and i got to be very suspicious
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:25.280]  and i'm not against our troops but i went to Vietnam twice and i realized
[02:25:25.280 --> 02:25:29.600]  i was being lied to and so that's when i kind of woke up and said okay i'm
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:33.040]  going to listen to my rich dad i'm going to find out what's really going on
[02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:36.880]  so that's all i do when i write rich dad or dad i say your house is not an asset
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:39.920]  i got hate mail from my friends who are realtors
[02:25:39.920 --> 02:25:43.440]  you know i didn't say don't buy our houses it's not an asset
[02:25:43.440 --> 02:25:48.960]  and and you know in 19 i mean 2002 i wrote rich dad's prophecy
[02:25:48.960 --> 02:25:52.400]  and it was about the biggest stock market crash in history that's still coming
[02:25:52.400 --> 02:25:56.880]  and it's about the 401k and at that time wall street journal smart money and
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:00.240]  money magazine just hung me up the flagpole it was the
[02:26:00.240 --> 02:26:03.920]  second crucifixion you know i was like geez i remember
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:08.560]  yeah i could crucify by those guys and then today our schools still bring in
[02:26:08.560 --> 02:26:12.080]  the bankers and tell you to save money and they still bring in the financial
[02:26:12.080 --> 02:26:15.600]  planners and tell you to put your money in a 401k for the long term
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.120]  and i'm saying that's another side to that that's where i make my money
[02:26:19.120 --> 02:26:23.360]  is on ignorance and all i do in rich dad is i listen to the other side
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:26.960]  that's a free country make your choice okay so you're somebody making two
[02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:29.520]  hundred thousand dollars a year keeping about a hundred thousand
[02:26:29.520 --> 02:26:33.120]  advert taxes what what does robert kieloszowski do
[02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:37.920]  i would take a class you know in 1973 i took classes on real estate i don't
[02:26:37.920 --> 02:26:41.600]  you know residential real estate i meet these idiots like my account
[02:26:41.600 --> 02:26:44.080]  he says yeah i'm a real estate investor i own a house
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:47.120]  i said no you're a consumer you're not an investor
[02:26:47.120 --> 02:26:51.760]  no i'm an investor but it's such a war run they don't nothing about tax code and
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:54.800]  all this stuff and property management and all the
[02:26:54.800 --> 02:26:59.680]  things that make you rich so i started off back in 1973 a little
[02:26:59.680 --> 02:27:03.520]  one bedroom one bath condo on the on the beach of mawi
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:08.320]  and that's where it began today on about 4 000 units five golf courses luxury
[02:27:08.320 --> 02:27:11.520]  hotels oil production throughout the world and business throughout the world
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:15.520]  gold mine silver mine but i didn't listen to the school system and that's the
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.400]  difference well that's like 10 years ago they said do not buy
[02:27:18.400 --> 02:27:22.080]  gold and silver it's a bad investment they're still saying it but to 1980
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:27.840]  inflation it's supposed to be 2500 an ounce issue to see me i was in 2000 on
[02:27:27.840 --> 02:27:30.960]  cnbc and they said what are you investing i said gold
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:35.840]  they said that's stupid it's 275 an ounce i said that's smart
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:39.840]  but they don't want gold to go up as you know
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:43.360]  because it means the fiat currency of the world is going to come apart
[02:27:43.360 --> 02:27:47.680]  and when it does gold's go into the moon and and right now if you don't have
[02:27:47.680 --> 02:27:50.720]  much money and i've been saying this for years because i'm actually a silver
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:54.640]  buff silver is the best investment of all because it's a consumable precious
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.880]  metal whereas gold is hoarded for the first time in the history of the world
[02:27:58.880 --> 02:28:03.280]  there is more gold than silver on planet earth so silver is a bargain
[02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:07.440]  even at 25 bucks and i hear that's right ron some i don't have any money i said
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:10.480]  jesus you know 25 bucks you don't have that you're in big trouble
[02:28:10.480 --> 02:28:13.920]  well what silver was five and a half six dollars 10 years ago it should look
[02:28:13.920 --> 02:28:17.200]  almost 25 an ounce right now i'd say that's a pretty good investment in
[02:28:17.200 --> 02:28:21.680]  anybody anybody could start buying one silver dollar a month i mean come on
[02:28:21.680 --> 02:28:26.160]  yes exactly right and i think silver is the biggest sleeper of all
[02:28:26.160 --> 02:28:30.240]  i've been saying this for years and you know everybody watches gold i have lots
[02:28:30.240 --> 02:28:34.080]  of gold i have a gold mine in china silver mine in south america
[02:28:34.080 --> 02:28:37.440]  but silver because i'm in the i'm in the industry
[02:28:37.440 --> 02:28:41.920]  i understand who buys my sober it's industry that's right it's used in
[02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:46.080]  in in manufacturing you name it water purification electronics every
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:49.600]  computer every cell phone and correct me if i'm wrong but i've
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:52.560]  read a lot of numbers and statistics seem reports that
[02:28:52.560 --> 02:28:56.320]  uh... they're now selling more gold than they are mining each year for the
[02:28:56.320 --> 02:28:59.920]  first time but it's even worse with silver that they can't find the
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:03.840]  silver they need to supply you're exactly correct and i'm in the
[02:29:03.840 --> 02:29:05.840]  industry i can tell you that
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:08.640]  wow we'll start getting into that that's really interesting
[02:29:08.640 --> 02:29:12.800]  well it again it's really simple you don't have to go to college for this
[02:29:12.800 --> 02:29:17.280]  silver is consumed silver is like oil you know it's burned up he
[02:29:17.280 --> 02:29:22.160]  he doesn't come back so silver is being burned up at higher speeds and the more
[02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:26.400]  we shift to the information age you know the more ipad that apple comes up with
[02:29:26.400 --> 02:29:29.920]  that it's like lithium in afghanistan we know why we're
[02:29:29.920 --> 02:29:35.120]  there yeah lithium mines i'm sure
[02:29:35.120 --> 02:29:38.800]  robert teosaki'll probably be in that we're gonna come back long segment
[02:29:38.800 --> 02:29:40.880]  coming up sorry about that right we gotta go to it
[02:29:40.880 --> 02:29:44.720]  let's get into why they told us don't buy gold and silver
[02:29:44.720 --> 02:29:47.920]  i mean they knew the rich were in there buying it they wanted it for themselves
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:51.040]  we'll be right back
[02:29:51.040 --> 02:29:54.880]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:54.880 --> 02:30:00.880]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[02:30:04.480 --> 02:30:09.680]  it ended on june of 2009 the millions of americans unable to find work might not
[02:30:09.680 --> 02:30:12.960]  agree perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government
[02:30:12.960 --> 02:30:16.160]  employees but for the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse
[02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:20.240]  gold and silver haven't heard the news either they've begun their long expected

[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:34.720]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen robert kiyosaki best-selling author
[02:33:34.720 --> 02:33:39.440]  researcher investor businessman self-help he is our
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:42.640]  guest we got about the 25 minutes left with him rich dad
[02:33:42.640 --> 02:33:46.320]  comms the website robert a continuing with
[02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:51.600]  gold and silver starting out a few decades ago there in your little bungalow
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:55.840]  in hawaii now owning you know a major oil drilling operations
[02:33:55.840 --> 02:33:59.680]  goldmine silver mine 4 000 plus apartment units
[02:33:59.680 --> 02:34:04.480]  and you know how to basically use the tax system they've written for the elite
[02:34:04.480 --> 02:34:09.760]  where you pay almost no taxes yes it's just a matter of financial education
[02:34:09.760 --> 02:34:13.680]  you know i mean some guys are hiding running into the hills
[02:34:13.680 --> 02:34:16.960]  joining different you know uh resistance groups
[02:34:16.960 --> 02:34:21.200]  i just decided to become a capitalist and play by the same rules they were playing
[02:34:21.200 --> 02:34:24.720]  because i fought in vietnam twice for capitalism
[02:34:24.720 --> 02:34:27.600]  i didn't fight for fascism which we have right now
[02:34:27.600 --> 02:34:31.840]  or socialism you know this idea of robin hood you know you take from the rich
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:34.880]  and you give to the poor just creates more poor people
[02:34:34.880 --> 02:34:38.800]  but that's what our school system teaches them they want surf so you
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:42.400]  they want to give a man fish not teach him how to fish yes and we're just
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:46.080]  creating we're just mass producing mass manufacturing poor people
[02:34:46.080 --> 02:34:48.640]  where do you see no financial education at school
[02:34:48.640 --> 02:34:52.320]  this is not ill it's not going to go worse where do you see gold and silver
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:55.200]  going well i got back i cautioned people in
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:58.560]  gold and silver because you know i started when gold was around
[02:34:58.560 --> 02:35:03.680]  265 an ounce and then i tracked it i was in gold and silver at 85
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:07.920]  back in the 70s so i watched it go up and down and i think they've got to watch
[02:35:07.920 --> 02:35:11.120]  out for its interest rates if if this guy for nacky gets
[02:35:11.120 --> 02:35:15.600]  desperate here he jacks interest rates let's say the 10% gold and silver crash
[02:35:15.600 --> 02:35:19.040]  so you really just don't buy gold and silver you've got to
[02:35:19.040 --> 02:35:23.120]  understand the dynamics that causes prices to go up or down
[02:35:23.120 --> 02:35:25.920]  but they're signaling they're going to continue with the lower interest rates
[02:35:25.920 --> 02:35:27.840]  and they're going to hyperinflate the currency
[02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:30.720]  that would that would be a major indicator of it going up
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:33.120]  it would be but i don't trust them i don't you know
[02:35:33.120 --> 02:35:36.000]  how do you tell when they're lying when their lips are moving so people have
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:39.280]  got to be ready to dump their gold and silver if the indicators come out no
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:42.800]  it's not bad it's not i think i think you and i are holding gold and silver at
[02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:46.560]  very very good price but i i think what i'm
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:50.400]  concerned about is the guys that come in with a gold let's say passing
[02:35:50.400 --> 02:35:53.280]  3000 they're the ones who are going to take the
[02:35:53.280 --> 02:35:56.800]  hand i tend to agree that's what i tell listeners just for my gut is that
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.200]  if inflation to 1980s 2500 an ounce i'm gonna start getting real nervous when
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:04.320]  it gets up there yes 25 as i think i think you're pretty
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:08.320]  accurate on that it's it's time to start pulling in your horns and uh
[02:36:08.320 --> 02:36:12.160]  look at something else like right now i'm actually pulling in my horns on gold
[02:36:12.160 --> 02:36:15.280]  once it passed 1100 is a little too rich for me
[02:36:15.280 --> 02:36:20.000]  i still bought silver but now i'm investing in my solar company
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:22.800]  so because i think you know like your guys are saying that's the way it's
[02:36:22.800 --> 02:36:27.360]  going to go so that's where i mean that so you basically look at the trends
[02:36:27.360 --> 02:36:31.760]  and head your bets throughout the trends and don't just plump your money down in
[02:36:31.760 --> 02:36:35.520]  a bank getting almost zero percent that's correct and the thing i watch for i
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:38.960]  mean my father my poor dad was a politician
[02:36:38.960 --> 02:36:42.560]  i don't trust those guys i mean i love my dad but
[02:36:42.560 --> 02:36:47.440]  they don't know jack there there is no correlation between politics and business
[02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:50.800]  well wisdom today he is buying into whatever
[02:36:50.800 --> 02:36:53.840]  the establishment says and they're there to flee shoot
[02:36:53.840 --> 02:36:57.680]  right and the reason i want to be on your show show is because of info
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:02.000]  world i have wars i agree 100% they want to control
[02:37:02.000 --> 02:37:06.080]  what you hear and what you think and they will censor you know there's no
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:10.240]  censorship bunch of bull you will be censored in this country
[02:37:10.240 --> 02:37:14.400]  so that's the thing i i'm saying you gotta understand that
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:18.160]  you have to be smarter you know i'm what i'm terrified of right now there's
[02:37:18.160 --> 02:37:21.200]  going to be what they call you know when it goes parabolic when gold passes
[02:37:21.200 --> 02:37:24.240]  3000 and everybody will roll in there and then they're going to get
[02:37:24.240 --> 02:37:30.240]  suckered out again happens every time after the real thing
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:33.840]  well look that's what my gut tells me is when to get out of the bubble at the
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:36.640]  right time yeah but also it's not so much when you
[02:37:36.640 --> 02:37:41.440]  get out is when you get in and getting in is when your profits are made when
[02:37:41.440 --> 02:37:44.560]  you buy and so you look all the suckers right now
[02:37:44.560 --> 02:37:48.880]  whatever you know it's the same thing i see all these guys we buy gold we buy
[02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:54.480]  gold we buy you know turn it in you know the bubble's coming
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:37:58.480]  and all the suckers will roll into the market
[02:37:58.480 --> 02:38:02.160]  well when you've got two percent of the population in gold and uh they're
[02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:04.640]  talking about maybe ten percent the next two years yeah
[02:38:04.640 --> 02:38:07.760]  that's when you know there's a serious situation but i think
[02:38:07.760 --> 02:38:11.920]  i think there's a long time and this is my personal view
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:15.440]  until they do try to deflate the bubble yeah and
[02:38:15.440 --> 02:38:19.600]  that's why you know gold at 13 gold at 15 gold at 2
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:23.840]  i would say not a bad buy but i'd be very cautious
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:27.440]  because desperate people do desperate things i mean you saw what bradaki said
[02:38:27.440 --> 02:38:31.600]  a few days ago he says i don't understand the price movement in gold
[02:38:31.600 --> 02:38:35.760]  i said bradaki you look i printed that stuff
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:39.840]  we can also see wild gyrations up and down before it's all over
[02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:44.080]  yeah so we could see a false popping in the bubble i have lots of gold and lots
[02:38:44.080 --> 02:38:48.000]  of silver i'm just cautioning me no i agree don't come in late
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:51.680]  i agree robert you talk about info wars
[02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:54.960]  uh you talk about how we're being lied to when we look at this military
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:58.080]  industrial complex owned by the big mega six banks
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:01.120]  they're now openly saying that they're going to start taking pension funds and
[02:39:01.120 --> 02:39:04.320]  taxing and we talked about that so desperate people do do desperate
[02:39:04.320 --> 02:39:08.160]  things at your bottom line looking into your crystal
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:11.520]  ball where do you see society i mean do you see this recession depression
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:15.280]  getting worse where do you see this going well it's all relative you know i mean
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:19.120]  get that old saying if your neighbor loses the job
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.560]  it's in a recession if you lose your job you're in a depression
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:26.560]  another part more rich dad where i personally stand from if you understand
[02:39:26.560 --> 02:39:31.200]  the rules of the rich it's really a good time to get rich
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:35.120]  you know i'm not saying being poor is bad i just don't look good in poor clothing
[02:39:35.120 --> 02:39:39.680]  yeah there's ways to make money and uh in in in any market yeah so if you sit in
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:42.800]  there listening to what your mommy and daddy told you you know was go to school
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:46.320]  and get a job work hard save money buy a house that's an asset
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:50.080]  and give your money to the to wall street through a 401k
[02:39:50.080 --> 02:39:56.400]  you're probably gonna get pleased well robert we're being pleased
[02:39:56.400 --> 02:39:58.800]  we're honored to have you here today and i've got a bunch of other questions i
[02:39:58.800 --> 02:40:02.400]  want to throw at you and rampage succession but uh what was the main
[02:40:02.400 --> 02:40:07.280]  what's the main knowledge you want to impart to our listeners i mean
[02:40:07.280 --> 02:40:10.800]  well basically you have to understand the rules of the rich
[02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:14.000]  i'm not saying they're good or bad a lot of greedy poor people a lot of greedy
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.760]  rich people but the smarter you are you don't become a victim to it
[02:40:17.760 --> 02:40:20.880]  me you need to take control exactly what alex
[02:40:20.880 --> 02:40:25.680]  jones is saying you need to take control of what you put inside your head
[02:40:25.680 --> 02:40:28.960]  you know if you don't control that you're screwed
[02:40:28.960 --> 02:40:32.400]  you've got to take control of what you put into your head
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:35.920]  so if you listen to those garbage the school system puts out politicians put
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:38.400]  out and wall street puts out and banks put out
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:43.200]  you're gonna you're gonna get hammered i've seen breakdowns of the average cnbc
[02:40:43.200 --> 02:40:47.520]  host with their predictions uh they're wrong over 87 percent of the time
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:51.200]  somebody like yourself and and others we have on are right more than 90 percent
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:54.640]  of the time but but it's not that a lot of those pundits are stupid
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:58.640]  they're they're selling a fraud they know what they're doing they have to say
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:03.760]  what they say if they say what i said or what you said they'd be fired
[02:41:03.760 --> 02:41:07.520]  it's that simple i mean they're not bad people that's kind of what i'm putting
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:11.840]  out there we're not bad people we're just we haven't taken control of the
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:15.680]  information in our brain and there is that lie of advertising
[02:41:15.680 --> 02:41:19.760]  that perceptions reality will know if you stumble off a thousand foot cliff and
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:23.120]  you think there's water at the bottom and and there isn't your perception that
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.400]  you saw water at the bottom isn't isn't going to save you
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:30.480]  now i'm not just reading this little uh was from smart money magazine those
[02:41:30.480 --> 02:41:33.040]  but those guys really hate me but anyway
[02:41:33.040 --> 02:41:37.040]  uh they had this poor guy is 58 years old he says i don't have a pension what
[02:41:37.040 --> 02:41:41.040]  should i do they said save money and get a 401k
[02:41:41.040 --> 02:41:44.640]  i mean it's the same dogma from the guys that brought you this financial
[02:41:44.640 --> 02:41:47.920]  crisis oh they're now saying give them more
[02:41:47.920 --> 02:41:50.480]  power over the entire world financial system
[02:41:50.480 --> 02:41:54.000]  and they'll save us yes exactly i mean that's like
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.960]  you've got to take control of what you put in your head
[02:41:56.960 --> 02:42:02.160]  uh let's talk about your your overall view of uh politics and and the direction
[02:42:02.160 --> 02:42:04.800]  the world's going on there there's a large awakening happening
[02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:08.800]  uh correct me if you're uh if you disagree speak about that but also
[02:42:08.800 --> 02:42:12.320]  things like other lies like like what do you think of government sponsored
[02:42:12.320 --> 02:42:14.640]  terrorism what do you think of the gulf of tonkin
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:18.240]  being staged to get us into the vietnam war uh what's your view on some of the
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:23.120]  rabbits they may pull out of their hat i don't i wouldn't put it past any of them
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.960]  that's that's all i don't know if they're true or not true
[02:42:26.960 --> 02:42:30.560]  i you know like i always say to people take care of my god helps those who
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:34.400]  help themselves i help myself and i watch what they say i always
[02:42:34.400 --> 02:42:38.880]  know their self-interest it was always self-interest so
[02:42:38.880 --> 02:42:43.600]  so i just watch them i why are we in iraq and afghanistan
[02:42:43.600 --> 02:42:47.120]  you know i i don't understand that and when i say that a lot of times is well
[02:42:47.120 --> 02:42:51.600]  you're not a patriarch i say hey moron i went to vietnam twice what did you do
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:55.040]  you know i've seen war ocean clinton never saw war
[02:42:55.040 --> 02:42:59.280]  and that's why they sent them well it's not patriotic to be used to
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:04.320]  expand a corporate empire and and and and to kill a million iraqis
[02:43:04.320 --> 02:43:08.000]  yep all in the name of what i don't know but
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:13.120]  i you know i you know i have the same page you gotta take control of what you
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:17.120]  put in your head you know what i didn't like about school is i didn't
[02:43:17.120 --> 02:43:20.080]  really have much choice of what i could learn
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:23.760]  you know it's kind of government sanctioned propaganda
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:26.560]  so you know i was in my third year of calculus i'm
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:30.000]  nearly flunking out they go when am i ever going to use this stuff when am i
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:33.520]  going to use calculus the teacher said i don't know
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:39.600]  so then why am i studying well there's a war on for our minds that's
[02:43:39.600 --> 02:43:43.200]  our slogan exactly and that's why there's a war but
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:47.280]  you are ultimately the person that decides
[02:43:47.280 --> 02:43:50.080]  yeah i think about the general public who are starting to wake up a little bit
[02:43:50.080 --> 02:43:54.000]  but they still have no clue how deep this almost hologram
[02:43:54.000 --> 02:43:57.120]  of disinformation is that's projected into society
[02:43:57.120 --> 02:44:00.720]  and then we repeat the disinfo and that gives it that tangible
[02:44:00.720 --> 02:44:04.800]  reality but it's not reality yeah well let me ask you this what do you think
[02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:08.480]  if the fed like right now we're at about 96
[02:44:08.480 --> 02:44:11.840]  percent debt to gdp you know i mean we have
[02:44:11.840 --> 02:44:15.120]  and we're the biggest debtor nation in the world what do you think
[02:44:15.120 --> 02:44:19.920]  is going to happen if they print more money it is going to
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:24.160]  hyper inflate the currency drive up prices but then
[02:44:24.160 --> 02:44:26.800]  the new debts and fractional reserve banking
[02:44:26.800 --> 02:44:30.480]  calculations that are made will be made in the new denomination and value
[02:44:30.480 --> 02:44:34.560]  and so we'll just stay in debt and actually get into worse debt
[02:44:34.560 --> 02:44:39.280]  so uh well what kind of action are you taking so that's really
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:42.880]  that's what they'll probably do and i think what you're saying what i'm saying
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:46.400]  it's not so much what they're going to do is what are you and i going to
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:49.680]  well i know what i'm doing i'm my main mission is just to wake people up so
[02:44:49.680 --> 02:44:52.480]  they know they're how they're being hammered because the big central banks
[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:55.680]  have openly stated their plan it was to engineer all this
[02:44:55.680 --> 02:45:01.760]  collapse society and then use the social unrest as a pretext to
[02:45:01.760 --> 02:45:05.680]  swing around the homeland security grid on the american people and that's
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:09.040]  already i know coming from behind the curtain into plain view
[02:45:09.040 --> 02:45:14.480]  uh and so i'm simply pouring almost all of our assets into this information
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:19.520]  warfare operation to counter the system so i guess i'm kind of like a uh
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:22.640]  for lack of a better term you know kind of like uh flying my
[02:45:22.640 --> 02:45:26.080]  information warfare plane you know into the deck of their biggest
[02:45:26.080 --> 02:45:29.600]  capital ship just trying to get people to realize what's
[02:45:29.600 --> 02:45:33.200]  happening and we've got emergency backup to fund the operation with gold and
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:36.800]  silver uh investments i'm trying to intensify the
[02:45:36.800 --> 02:45:40.560]  amount of films and and and material i'm putting out but
[02:45:40.560 --> 02:45:44.480]  that's basically it that's outstanding thank you for doing that
[02:45:44.480 --> 02:45:49.280]  because that's really what it's going to take is that somebody has to stand up
[02:45:49.280 --> 02:45:52.720]  and the more people stand up and wake up the less power
[02:45:52.720 --> 02:45:59.600]  the opposition has well what i do as rich dev is i explain how the rich play
[02:45:59.600 --> 02:46:04.080]  the game and that way i have a choice of games
[02:46:04.080 --> 02:46:07.760]  i just you know i wouldn't send my kid to school to get a job
[02:46:07.760 --> 02:46:12.000]  because you're just being programmed to be proletariat working class
[02:46:12.000 --> 02:46:15.840]  i'd rather have my kid learn to be a capitalist you know and that's what i
[02:46:15.840 --> 02:46:19.360]  fought for that's i mean that's all i'm saying i fought to the capitalism
[02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:23.200]  and we have a bunch of fascist Nazis running the show
[02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:26.320]  they're not even socialists
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:31.840]  yeah socialism's bad enough but at least theoretically some of the
[02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:36.240]  stolen loot gets to somebody but here it just all goes off shore to these people
[02:46:36.240 --> 02:46:40.160]  and they just get away with more and more i mean it's scary to know there's
[02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:44.320]  this much hubris in the ruling class well what's what frightens me is when
[02:46:44.320 --> 02:46:48.000]  the government has that much when i fear my own government
[02:46:48.000 --> 02:46:53.040]  that's not a good sign i tell us about the most important books people can
[02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:56.240]  order from rich dad dot com and what your latest book covers you talk about an
[02:46:56.240 --> 02:47:00.000]  unfair advantage the conspiracy of the rich the eight
[02:47:00.000 --> 02:47:03.360]  the eight new rules of money i talk about that well conspiracy with the rich
[02:47:03.360 --> 02:47:07.520]  was the last book and it explains a lot of people already know
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:10.800]  it's how the fed started you know the britain woods
[02:47:10.800 --> 02:47:14.400]  but why we don't have a big section of this why there's no financial education
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:18.480]  at school so that goes back to 1904 with john d rockefeller
[02:47:18.480 --> 02:47:22.400]  and the general education board and at that point they took all financial
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:26.880]  education out of the school system and that way they could program people to
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:30.720]  work for the rich and our school system nea and all those
[02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:33.440]  guys they're quite happy to have them controlling the
[02:47:33.440 --> 02:47:37.200]  education system and they take the money out of your paycheck for most
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:40.720]  americans so you don't even really notice how much they're grabbing right that
[02:47:40.720 --> 02:47:45.200]  was in 1943 it was called the current tax payment act in 86
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:49.600]  was that the 86 tax reform act which then got doctors and lawyers so today
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:52.800]  doctors and lawyers or the self-employed or small business
[02:47:52.800 --> 02:47:56.800]  pay the highest taxes possible now when you look at
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:03.120]  me i pay zero tax yeah as england goes so goes the rest of the the world with
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:05.840]  all this tyranny have you have you noticed in the last month the
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:09.040]  government's announced that all paychecks will now be deposited with the
[02:48:09.040 --> 02:48:12.800]  government first and then they will pay you digitally to your bank account
[02:48:12.800 --> 02:48:16.800]  what they wish they really want to get us on this cashless system so they can
[02:48:16.800 --> 02:48:21.280]  really target the entire black market economy and shut it down
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:25.680]  i haven't heard that but that's why it's not socialism it's fascism
[02:48:25.680 --> 02:48:29.680]  when you fear your own government we have a problem
[02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:33.920]  we have a very big problem and what i was saying just for the last break there's
[02:48:33.920 --> 02:48:36.640]  no correlation between government and business
[02:48:36.640 --> 02:48:41.200]  there are two different worlds that's why obama has less than seven percent of
[02:48:41.200 --> 02:48:44.160]  its staff with any real-world business experience
[02:48:44.160 --> 02:48:47.360]  they don't know anything else but to help themselves
[02:48:47.360 --> 02:48:51.360]  by taking our money what political advice would you give the states rights
[02:48:51.360 --> 02:48:54.800]  movement taking back control of washington i see that as the best
[02:48:54.800 --> 02:48:58.640]  around i mean what politically you're talking to two million
[02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:01.840]  activists right now people that are really taking action robert what would
[02:49:01.840 --> 02:49:06.960]  you what are your best ideas for for for blocking
[02:49:06.960 --> 02:49:12.080]  this this fascist cartel well the best way is take care of yourself
[02:49:12.080 --> 02:49:15.520]  you know everybody wants to change the government which is almost fundamentally
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:18.320]  impossible there's too many people making too much
[02:49:18.320 --> 02:49:21.520]  money with exactly the way it is wall street and
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:25.120]  Goldman Sachs being one of them but i can change me
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:29.440]  and what you've been hearing me say is that i play by the rules of the rich
[02:49:29.440 --> 02:49:32.800]  but if you don't know what those rules are you're in trouble
[02:49:32.800 --> 02:49:35.920]  so conspiracy of the rich is where it kind of starts and this is the first i
[02:49:35.920 --> 02:49:39.760]  didn't know my publishers have released it but my next book an unfair
[02:49:39.760 --> 02:49:42.960]  advantage the power of financial education goes into how
[02:49:42.960 --> 02:49:47.680]  debt and taxes make guys like me rich but our school system will never
[02:49:47.680 --> 02:49:50.480]  teach you that because they don't want you to know that
[02:49:50.480 --> 02:49:54.800]  so i just explained the rules of the rich i i watch out for myself
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:59.440]  and that way and i make a lot of people rich and all this but if i don't take
[02:49:59.440 --> 02:50:04.560]  care of myself i can't save anybody else so that's kind of my ground i my
[02:50:04.560 --> 02:50:08.080]  father was a political animal he ran for governor of
[02:50:08.080 --> 02:50:11.600]  a state of hawaii you know and that was the most
[02:50:11.600 --> 02:50:14.880]  horrifying ugly thing i'd ever seen in my whole life
[02:50:14.880 --> 02:50:18.240]  so i don't have any faith in the two-party system i don't have any faith
[02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:22.320]  in government because as you and i know the fed and the central bank control the
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:25.520]  world there was a washington times article about the only
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:29.200]  city in the nation to becoming even richer and expanding and jobs
[02:50:29.200 --> 02:50:33.280]  is dc the cancer is growing yes and that's what
[02:50:33.280 --> 02:50:36.880]  that's why i'm not political you know i would just rather
[02:50:36.880 --> 02:50:41.280]  be an independent like a coyote you're running around the place
[02:50:41.280 --> 02:50:44.480]  well certainly for you individually that's good and it's wonderful to people
[02:50:44.480 --> 02:50:48.320]  to be rugged individualists like you are robert but
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:51.680]  they're just adding more and more taxes more and more controls more and more
[02:50:51.680 --> 02:50:54.080]  selective enforcement i see this down the road
[02:50:54.080 --> 02:50:57.200]  where they're going to start trying to selectively change rules or selectively
[02:50:57.200 --> 02:51:01.840]  enforce them to try to shut down the cowboys like yourself
[02:51:01.840 --> 02:51:05.440]  yeah but they can't afford to that see if you understand the really the rules
[02:51:05.440 --> 02:51:10.720]  they have to shut themselves down in my best defense is to play on their side
[02:51:10.720 --> 02:51:15.440]  so you know the inside baseball rules you basically are
[02:51:15.440 --> 02:51:19.040]  with the owners of the casino because you know they're blueprints so you're safe
[02:51:19.040 --> 02:51:24.560]  yeah and that's what rich dad stands for i just teach you there's two sides to
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:28.160]  a point and these people who are sending their kids to school the biggest
[02:51:28.160 --> 02:51:32.800]  communist thing i've ever seen you know the kids just get brainwashed there
[02:51:32.800 --> 02:51:36.480]  and they don't know learn anything about money i'm not against education i'm
[02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:40.160]  against brainwashing they just turn their children over
[02:51:40.160 --> 02:51:43.920]  to the system that's correct where they train the kids to tattle on you to spy
[02:51:43.920 --> 02:51:48.000]  on you that the environment's dying have you seen the tv ad they're running in
[02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:51.600]  england where where the the school teacher asked the uh you know like
[02:51:51.600 --> 02:51:55.040]  sixth graders what will you do for the environment and when some of the kids
[02:51:55.040 --> 02:52:00.560]  say i'll do nothing she murders them no
[02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:05.120]  anyway you know i mean that sounds crazy but that was put out by the 1010
[02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:08.720]  project i promise you it's called it's called splattergate just google it
[02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:11.760]  guys did you find the london guardian article about government to take
[02:52:11.760 --> 02:52:15.440]  british paychecks
[02:52:15.920 --> 02:52:19.280]  okay yeah there it is on the headline british government to seize all paychecks
[02:52:19.280 --> 02:52:23.040]  what do you think of that robert well it doesn't surprise me like i said this
[02:52:23.040 --> 02:52:29.120]  is it goes on in our country too 1943 current tax payment at 86 tax reform act
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:33.120]  just understand that my new book was coming out is called an unfair advantage
[02:52:33.120 --> 02:52:37.040]  it may be out in a month or two months the first time it's been announced but
[02:52:37.040 --> 02:52:40.400]  in there i'll i explain how the taxes and debt
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:45.120]  make me rich you have to know how to use debt and you have to know how to use
[02:52:45.120 --> 02:52:49.920]  taxes in your favor but to try and change this rule
[02:52:49.920 --> 02:52:53.920]  i don't put much faith in it they're going to always take from the poor and
[02:52:53.920 --> 02:52:57.760]  give to the rich that's what that's what's going on
[02:52:57.760 --> 02:53:01.680]  and i'd rather just be rich and not be part of the poor and they've got the
[02:53:01.680 --> 02:53:04.320]  so many of the poor tricked into thinking they lobby
[02:53:04.320 --> 02:53:07.360]  government yes to protect them from the ultra rich
[02:53:07.360 --> 02:53:11.120]  yeah the ultra rich finance the government yes
[02:53:11.120 --> 02:53:16.480]  yes that's why when they repealed like a mccain fine goal i knew it was all over
[02:53:16.480 --> 02:53:19.440]  see what mccain and fine goal we're trying to do was limit campaign
[02:53:19.440 --> 02:53:22.240]  contributions well that was thrown out the window
[02:53:22.240 --> 02:53:26.160]  so now when people think was one man one vote that's not true
[02:53:26.160 --> 02:53:30.560]  it really is one million dollars one vote
[02:53:30.560 --> 02:53:35.280]  it's all i'm not telling anybody anything new the rich always control it
[02:53:35.280 --> 02:53:40.080]  so i just chose when i came back in 1973 from vietnam i said i'm just going to
[02:53:40.080 --> 02:53:42.960]  be on the rich side i don't want to be like my poor dad
[02:53:42.960 --> 02:53:47.360]  a school teacher fighting the system you have no power when you have no money
[02:53:47.360 --> 02:53:50.720]  you have no power when the taxes are just eating you alive
[02:53:50.720 --> 02:53:55.680]  okay well let's say we got a 71 year old person who's got a million dollars
[02:53:55.680 --> 02:54:00.800]  uh in their retirement fund uh what would you do with that million dollars
[02:54:00.800 --> 02:54:05.440]  i buy real but i'm not you can't do that because
[02:54:05.440 --> 02:54:08.880]  you know i've been trained for all these years yeah that's the problem because
[02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:11.280]  you've got to have the specific knowledge not just the money exactly and
[02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:14.560]  that's why i said again 1973 i started taking real estate courses
[02:54:14.560 --> 02:54:18.160]  not because of real estate but i have to learn to manage yeah knowledge is power
[02:54:18.160 --> 02:54:20.960]  and so even if people have money if they don't have the knowledge
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:24.960]  or the time to implement it they can't do it but you have studiously
[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:29.200]  built and built and built until now i mean i mean
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:32.880]  i mean how much is your total empire worth ballpark i don't know
[02:54:32.880 --> 02:54:36.320]  but i make more than two million a month without working
[02:54:36.320 --> 02:54:40.320]  tax-free so it's not a lot of money i'm not Donald
[02:54:40.320 --> 02:54:45.040]  trump or stuff like that but two million a month tax-free is pretty good
[02:54:45.040 --> 02:54:49.200]  well not to mention your books um yeah that's not that's not including my
[02:54:49.200 --> 02:54:53.360]  books or anything else that's just from income from my real estate my
[02:54:53.360 --> 02:54:57.040]  investments but 26 million plus copies of books
[02:54:57.040 --> 02:55:01.280]  yeah i just wrote those books after i was already rich
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:04.000]  no i understand that trying to impart that and that's really something
[02:55:04.000 --> 02:55:07.840]  revolutionary you've done that's really contributed to people
[02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:11.280]  understanding what's happening and i've seen the success stories of people that
[02:55:11.280 --> 02:55:15.040]  have put your system into motion they have become fabulously wealthy as well
[02:55:15.040 --> 02:55:19.200]  well it's not so much wealthy as they now have control over their lives
[02:55:19.200 --> 02:55:24.080]  you see if you learn the rules of the rich which is get in debt
[02:55:24.080 --> 02:55:28.560]  you will get richer you see his knowledge is power
[02:55:28.560 --> 02:55:33.680]  but misinformation is damaging and so all of these guys who are trying to
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:38.080]  you know save their house and save money for their retirement and all this
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:41.760]  i think that's good if you have no information but
[02:55:41.760 --> 02:55:45.520]  yeah if you want to beat the system you got to get smarter i saw an article in
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:48.080]  the wall street journal a few months ago where they admitted that it's the
[02:55:48.080 --> 02:55:51.680]  people worth over 10 million dollars they're the first to walk away from a
[02:55:51.680 --> 02:55:55.040]  house that's upside down but then a blue collar person they'll go down with the
[02:55:55.040 --> 02:55:57.920]  ship yes but that's changing right now because i was
[02:55:57.920 --> 02:56:02.160]  at my local italian restaurant that the three cooks came out that said hey
[02:56:02.160 --> 02:56:07.760]  can we ask you a question i said yes we we haven't paid our mortgage in 18 months
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:10.800]  and i said why is your stock it says because the mortgage was greater than
[02:56:10.800 --> 02:56:15.200]  our house i said well you're pretty smart
[02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:20.480]  i said you're so far behind you're now ahead
[02:56:20.480 --> 02:56:24.880]  amazing robert thank you so much for spending time with us i hope that you'll
[02:56:24.880 --> 02:56:28.160]  come back with us in the future and i'm i'm a flatter that you're aware of the
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:31.200]  show and the work we do here now i've heard a lot of good things about you
[02:56:31.200 --> 02:56:34.640]  hurt you causing a lot of trouble so that's why i had to call up

[02:56:52.080 --> 02:56:55.280]  i think when gold goes above 25 right now that's when it becomes a bubble and
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:58.880]  dangerous but i do agree with him i have so many people who don't have a lot of
[02:56:58.880 --> 02:57:02.480]  money ask me where do i get in well you get in with silver dollars and silver
