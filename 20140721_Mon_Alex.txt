[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:40.480]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.480 --> 00:45.520]  here we are ladies and gentlemen kicking off another week it is the 21st day of
[00:45.520 --> 00:52.000]  July 2014 I am your host Alex Jones are gonna be live here Lord willing for the
[00:52.000 --> 00:58.920]  next three hours I've been sitting in here the last 30 minutes or so going
[00:58.920 --> 01:02.280]  back over the news that I was researching early this morning and last
[01:02.280 --> 01:06.840]  night and some of the news that we covered yesterday evening on the Sunday
[01:06.840 --> 01:14.280]  broadcast that was live 4 to 6 p.m. and I just pinched myself yet again that we
[01:14.280 --> 01:19.000]  are in this situation that our world has gotten this crazy and that there is
[01:19.000 --> 01:29.960]  intensified fighter bomber attacks by Ukraine into the east area of the Crimea
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.160]  that the entire Western world is promoting basically a new Cold War with
[01:35.160 --> 01:39.600]  Russia and saying now that Russia is the enemy all because of this airline
[01:39.600 --> 01:44.360]  being shot down in a war zone and Russia hasn't even taken responsibility for it
[01:44.360 --> 01:50.880]  and the public is so dumbed down and the media is so controlled that it's still
[01:50.880 --> 01:55.440]  not an issue other than CBS News and a few other reports I've seen what we
[01:55.440 --> 02:02.640]  pointed out day one last week is that that flight was routed through an area
[02:02.640 --> 02:09.000]  where for at least two months FAA Europe there's a branch of the FAA over
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.640]  there but also the EU air traffic control had banned flights flying over
[02:13.640 --> 02:19.360]  that area and no flights have been directed over it there's another bizarre
[02:19.360 --> 02:31.320]  story up on info wars.com by Paul Joseph Watson today and that deals with a
[02:31.320 --> 02:38.680]  Malaysia Airlines diverting flights over Syria airspace what's going on with
[02:38.680 --> 02:44.040]  Malaysian Airlines you got one of them disappearing you've got this other one
[02:44.040 --> 02:52.400]  directed right over the war zone that no one dare fly into and I mean they give
[02:52.400 --> 02:57.880]  you a flight plan folks you follow it or fighter jets come up make you land it's
[02:57.880 --> 03:05.560]  been like that for 60 years all over the world and then now we've got another
[03:06.080 --> 03:12.360]  Malaysian airliner flying right over the war zone in Syria where you're not
[03:12.360 --> 03:18.320]  supposed to fly and there's a flying ban a no-fly zone I mean what's going on
[03:18.320 --> 03:23.640]  with Malaysian Airlines these are brand-new 777 jets they've never had
[03:23.640 --> 03:28.520]  issues before I looked into it this morning something's going on they've
[03:28.520 --> 03:32.680]  got some weird deal with the Malaysian government or something with some type
[03:32.680 --> 03:38.200]  of weird clandestine hanky-panky and when I bring this up the control dinosaur
[03:38.200 --> 03:43.240]  media state-run media will say Alex with more theories hey these aren't
[03:43.240 --> 03:50.720]  theories they diverted that doomed flight it was shot down last week right
[03:50.720 --> 03:54.080]  over a war zone that nobody dare fly over where missiles are shooting up in
[03:54.080 --> 04:02.240]  the air and fighter bombers are bombing cities the Russian rebels had shot down
[04:02.240 --> 04:05.840]  three aircrafts in one week before that
[04:10.520 --> 04:15.080]  so this is the type of garbage we're dealing with so I intend to open the
[04:15.080 --> 04:18.520]  phones up on this subject and see what you think especially if you've worked
[04:18.520 --> 04:25.640]  for the FAA or if you've worked in military air traffic control and we have
[04:25.640 --> 04:29.000]  a lot of air traffic controllers current and retired listening does any of this
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.560]  make sense to you you're the experts I'm gonna open the phones up specifically
[04:32.560 --> 04:41.680]  for people who are pilots or who have a civilian or military or private and I

[08:00.160 --> 08:21.360]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[08:31.120 --> 08:37.040]  ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this Monday edition as we
[08:37.040 --> 08:45.080]  broadcast worldwide on the 21st day of July coming up for the first 30 minutes
[08:45.080 --> 08:50.200]  of the next hour Glenn Spencer of American Border Patrol one of the most
[08:50.200 --> 08:55.720]  versatile activist in the last 20 years exposing the plan of the Forge
[08:55.720 --> 09:00.360]  Foundation in Mexico to break up the United States as part of a North American
[09:00.360 --> 09:06.880]  Union using Mexican nationalism and border crises to bring it in he's been
[09:06.880 --> 09:11.120]  predicting this for more than 12 years that I've been interviewing him on air
[09:11.120 --> 09:17.640]  he's been an activist since he was a Native American organization activist for
[09:17.640 --> 09:24.280]  the tribal lands and then began to research how Mexico was treating the
[09:24.280 --> 09:29.560]  natives down there who were the indigenous peoples and he is one of the
[09:29.560 --> 09:33.760]  most outspoken folks on the border he moved from California to Arizona I don't
[09:33.760 --> 09:38.040]  know five six seven years ago to be right there on the border and to be able
[09:38.040 --> 09:44.200]  to detail what was happening and unfolding so that's coming up the start
[09:44.200 --> 09:48.600]  of the next hour then at the bottom of that hour I was gonna air this last
[09:48.600 --> 09:58.280]  Thursday but the Malaysian airliner shootdown started so I decided to wait
[09:58.280 --> 10:05.680]  until this week so that it would not be covered up in the rest of the news and
[10:05.680 --> 10:10.480]  that is a 15 minute report we put together was some of the highlights of
[10:10.480 --> 10:19.080]  Matt Drudge in 1998 in a 50 minute speech predicting with almost
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.680]  prescient understanding what would happen to the media landscape in the
[10:24.680 --> 10:32.040]  future it's easy to make predictions now because we're already here but if you
[10:32.040 --> 10:39.800]  go back to 1998 it's truly a trailblazing speech and we've added some
[10:39.800 --> 10:43.480]  video clips and news articles and documents to it to make it even more
[10:43.480 --> 10:51.160]  powerful because I saw the speech again on the 15th anniversary and it got
[10:51.160 --> 10:54.440]  picked up by Time Magazine and others pointing out that Drudge was right and
[10:54.440 --> 11:01.000]  then I happened to come across the video again a few weeks ago and decided that I
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.760]  wanted to again put out a special report on it so that's coming up at the bottom
[11:07.760 --> 11:15.280]  of the next hour and then we've got Syrian girl joining us again who since
[11:15.280 --> 11:17.680]  he first started appearing on this show about a year and a half ago has gone
[11:17.680 --> 11:21.680]  public with her full name and the fact she lives in Australia and that she's
[11:21.680 --> 11:28.120]  part of an exiled family that were kicked out by the Assad's father and who
[11:28.120 --> 11:31.120]  were part of the ruling government previous to that so she is a big
[11:31.120 --> 11:34.480]  insider and everything she talked about the last year and a half turned out to
[11:34.480 --> 11:39.000]  be a hundred percent accurate I mean really knows her stuff and now she goes
[11:39.000 --> 11:44.160]  on national Australian television and talks about these subjects as well so
[11:44.160 --> 11:54.680]  she'll be joining us coming up from Australia in the third hour today and
[11:54.680 --> 12:01.120]  we'll talk about the situation with ISIS the situation in Ukraine not just in
[12:01.120 --> 12:08.000]  the Middle East show the truth about ISIS with Syrian girl coming up today for
[12:08.000 --> 12:15.960]  at least part probably 30 40 minutes of the of the third hour I want to open the
[12:15.960 --> 12:28.120]  phones up after I cover some news here in a moment to deal with the shoot down of
[12:28.120 --> 12:34.920]  the Malaysian airliner mh-17 last week and I want to talk to people that are
[12:34.920 --> 12:42.040]  again private pilots commercial pilots military pilots or air traffic controllers
[12:42.040 --> 12:46.600]  because I know a little bit about air traffic control my dad's been a policy
[12:46.600 --> 12:52.480]  I was a little kid both on helicopters and you know Cessna's things like that
[12:52.480 --> 12:57.200]  so we would fly to see grandma you know on the weekend and land in the cattle
[12:57.200 --> 13:02.080]  pasture I just remember being on my dad on those flights and the fact that there
[13:02.080 --> 13:07.920]  would be a big storm and he couldn't go around it because there'd be military
[13:07.920 --> 13:13.600]  bases on both sides he would find in local airport we'd land and then go in
[13:13.600 --> 13:17.400]  and get some chips out of the vending machine and drink some coffee till it
[13:17.400 --> 13:22.720]  blew over and if it didn't blow over he'd get coffee I'd get you know a
[13:22.720 --> 13:27.240]  sun kiss soft drink or something we didn't blow over we would go stay at a
[13:27.240 --> 13:33.320]  little hotel motel in the town and that happened a few times probably flew with
[13:33.320 --> 13:37.320]  my dad 50 60 times probably more than that probably a hundred times and a
[13:37.320 --> 13:41.800]  couple times had to land the plane because he couldn't fly around a
[13:41.800 --> 13:46.760]  thunderstorm because there were so many military bases the minute you start
[13:46.760 --> 13:51.280]  straying off your flight path they come on the radio and they say what are you
[13:51.280 --> 13:57.760]  doing they call out your number and if you don't do what they tell you f-16s
[13:57.760 --> 14:04.760]  are on your butt in about 10 minutes that's why 9-11 was a fraud they said
[14:04.760 --> 14:09.520]  in the news u.s. today you name it that no aircrafts had ever been intercepted in
[14:09.520 --> 14:15.240]  u.s. history and it was completely normal that norad stood down for 50 plus
[14:15.240 --> 14:21.880]  minutes and if they lost the planes which obviously wasn't true and air
[14:21.880 --> 14:26.880]  traffic controllers have gone public about that that it was all fraud I don't
[14:26.880 --> 14:30.880]  know exactly what happened on 9-11 but I know that the air traffic controllers
[14:30.880 --> 14:33.640]  when they finally released part of the tapes were saying what is this
[14:33.640 --> 14:38.760]  simulation you've taken control and you're putting simulated aircraft over
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.960]  everything we're doing that see that's the centralization that norad had that's
[14:42.960 --> 14:50.720]  why centralization and technocracy is so dangerous is that a very small group
[14:50.720 --> 14:55.560]  whoever they were basically turned the computers off and put overlays in there
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.720]  and you hear the air traffic controllers and people even at norad saying is this
[14:59.720 --> 15:03.040]  real or simulated why is there a drill going on right now while this is
[15:03.040 --> 15:12.280]  happening and they use the drill to basically have a cover of why someone at
[15:12.280 --> 15:19.680]  norad was overriding everything then they ordered the f-16s to fly it near
[15:19.680 --> 15:26.400]  stall speed and I got this from multiple military sources one of them a
[15:26.400 --> 15:33.960]  colonel who died after he came on the show colonel don de grand prix it was in
[15:33.960 --> 15:40.840]  black ops all over the world as an arms dealer after he was in the military
[15:40.840 --> 15:46.800]  and he died of a heart attack right after he came on might have been
[15:46.800 --> 15:52.560]  natural but it was so dangerous to be covering that at the time and he talked
[15:52.560 --> 16:00.160]  about how an air wing out of the Dakotas and then named them was it was in a
[16:00.160 --> 16:08.040]  drill in Virginia and fired to aim nines that's sidewinders into flight 93
[16:08.040 --> 16:11.760]  that's what the state police had they saw and her was a big explosion and the
[16:11.760 --> 16:15.080]  debris was over all those miles and the media would just lie about all of it
[16:15.080 --> 16:20.080]  again that's the issue of 9-11 you go into it and it just never ends how much
[16:20.080 --> 16:24.120]  evidence there is that the official story is a total fraud and then we attack
[16:24.120 --> 16:28.640]  the wrong country if you believe really 15 hijackers from Saudi Arabia did it
[16:28.640 --> 16:36.800]  and there was a stand-down ordered at this embassy in riyadh to order them to
[16:36.800 --> 16:39.960]  be allowed in the u.s. and I interviewed the head of the visa department at the
[16:39.960 --> 16:45.640]  embassy springman who said no they were CIA we were ordered to let them in and
[16:45.640 --> 16:50.800]  that their terror designation was a cover I mean he was in newspapers at the
[16:50.800 --> 16:56.840]  time in England and Canada I called got him on the show repeatedly and I didn't
[16:56.840 --> 17:01.040]  mean to go off into 9-11 today it's just that these are the type of false flags
[17:01.040 --> 17:04.880]  that get run we know our own governments has staged a bunch of false
[17:04.880 --> 17:11.880]  flags to get us into these wars we know Hitler started World War two with a
[17:11.880 --> 17:17.240]  false flag operation Hemler at Gliwitz so a whole string of false flags to blame
[17:17.240 --> 17:25.240]  the polls for attacking Germany so we'd be fools to not understand that
[17:25.240 --> 17:31.360]  clearly this is war propaganda and that they're trying to start a new war cold
[17:31.360 --> 17:35.520]  war economic war baby even physical war they're in a proxy war right now that's
[17:35.520 --> 17:40.840]  physical in Ukraine and that's what Syria and Iraq and all of this is about
[17:40.840 --> 17:46.320]  and the globalist are the bad guys in this running al-Qaeda running ISIS
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.160]  trying to overthrow all these countries let's not forget about all that the
[17:51.160 --> 17:55.120]  reason I want to talk to the air traffic people on the pilots the articles up on
[17:55.120 --> 18:00.880]  info wars comm in prison planet comm Malaysia airline diverts flight over
[18:00.880 --> 18:07.000]  Syrian air space where ISIS terrorists are armed with stinger missiles control
[18:07.000 --> 18:13.280]  35% of Syrian territory and there's a no-fly over the area where this aircraft
[18:13.280 --> 18:19.120]  flew this is getting weirder and weirder also a big story photo evidence shows
[18:19.120 --> 18:27.280]  Ukraine regime delivering the Buk missiles to troops and this isn't some
[18:27.280 --> 18:32.240]  Russian article claiming this which it's known that that the Ukrainians had
[18:32.240 --> 18:40.600]  these from when they were pro-Russia it's in Canadian television from an
[18:40.600 --> 18:49.360]  article about Ukrainian forces when ground in Ukraine in eastern Ukraine
[18:49.360 --> 19:01.720]  and Ukrainian forces when more ground in eastern Ukraine and it's an AP photo
[19:01.720 --> 19:05.920]  Ukrainian government forces maneuver any aircraft missile launchers as they are
[19:05.920 --> 19:16.000]  transported northwest on July 4th 2014 and it's an associated press article and
[19:16.000 --> 19:24.360]  photo picked up by Channel 24 or to see TV in Canada so it's not even an
[19:24.360 --> 19:29.920]  article about oh look the Ukrainians had this missile it's been known they had
[19:29.920 --> 19:33.280]  the missile but now it shows them rolling them into that area according to the
[19:33.280 --> 19:38.960]  AP an article about how valiant and wondrous they are so so it's establishment

[23:38.240 --> 23:41.520]  when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to
[23:41.520 --> 23:44.400]  the liberties of the people than a standing army Ted Anderson I'm placing a

[23:47.560 --> 23:53.680]  your copy 800-686-2237 it's time to understand the system call 800-686-2237
[23:53.680 --> 23:58.520]  that's 800-686-2237
[23:58.520 --> 24:20.360]  so Malaysian flight 17 shot down last week you would think is the only story in
[24:20.360 --> 24:25.040]  the world has been officially in scores of newspapers that I've seen been
[24:25.040 --> 24:30.520]  blamed directly on Vladimir Putin and again that's pure war propaganda pure
[24:30.520 --> 24:34.800]  demonization you have an aircraft that was flown over a warzone that was shot
[24:34.800 --> 24:42.520]  down the Russians may well have done it obviously the pro-russian rebels in the
[24:42.520 --> 24:48.600]  predominantly Russian ethnic area of Crimea clearly do have these missiles
[24:48.600 --> 24:52.840]  and have been shooting down military aircraft from Ukraine NATO back to
[24:52.840 --> 24:59.240]  been bombing them and so if you get on an airliner that gets directed over an
[24:59.240 --> 25:05.240]  airspace that's a war zone and you get shot down logic would say the blame would
[25:05.240 --> 25:10.600]  go on whoever directed that aircraft through there if the pilot just broke
[25:10.600 --> 25:16.680]  the law or made a mistake and flew over they should be blamed if the airline
[25:16.680 --> 25:21.880]  ordered it they should be blamed but I'll tell you what the airlines do they
[25:21.880 --> 25:26.000]  follow in major air corridors like that over a war zone I tell you they check
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.760]  their charts and their flight plan probably ten times this would have come
[25:31.760 --> 25:39.720]  from the EU air traffic control system the Ukrainian air traffic control system
[25:39.720 --> 25:45.720]  NATO FAA Europe the FAA is in Europe and they're on record two months ago saying
[25:45.720 --> 25:50.200]  don't fly through there not a recommendation not a warning an order
[25:50.200 --> 25:55.480]  now I'm no pilot I'm no air traffic controller that's what I know from just
[25:55.480 --> 26:00.280]  researching the news over the years and flying around with my dad and other
[26:00.280 --> 26:05.280]  pilots and being on private jets I've had some friends that have large private
[26:05.280 --> 26:08.680]  jets and I've been on them quite a few times and I like to fly up front the
[26:08.680 --> 26:12.520]  crash seat with the pilots and it's really neat and get to see all the stuff
[26:12.520 --> 26:15.240]  they're up to but we're gonna actually talk to air traffic controllers now
[26:15.240 --> 26:20.080]  pilots and others and find out if I'm wrong about this I want to go to Roy
[26:20.080 --> 26:24.440]  in Wyoming who's an air traffic controller then grandpa Stan is a pilot
[26:24.440 --> 26:32.160]  Danny is a former military pilot Brendan whose Air Force and John is a
[26:32.160 --> 26:35.320]  private pilot we'll get to all of you this is your sort segment long segment
[26:35.320 --> 26:39.920]  coming up but let's go to Roy in Wyoming Roy what do you think about this is an
[26:39.920 --> 26:43.840]  air traffic controller and did I get it right or part of it right now what do you
[26:43.840 --> 26:48.080]  think I mean isn't the story that that they did that all the other air traffic
[26:48.080 --> 26:51.760]  wasn't going through this corridor and that this flight went through a war
[26:51.760 --> 26:56.840]  zone hey Alex yeah you're absolutely right there's something that's not
[26:56.840 --> 27:00.320]  adding up there yeah if you know the pilots do check their flight plans 10
[27:00.320 --> 27:05.840]  times over the FAA said that they prohibit our airlines from flying over
[27:05.840 --> 27:08.960]  these war zones right now so there's no way that you see a carrier flying through
[27:08.960 --> 27:12.960]  there especially a 777 I'm not sure overseas how they're working that but I
[27:12.960 --> 27:17.200]  imagine it'd be similar since all of our rules are roughly the same or getting
[27:17.200 --> 27:21.720]  close to being the same so yeah you're right it's not adding up at all well I
[27:21.720 --> 27:25.920]  had some family that worked for FAA Europe and I gave them a call and they
[27:25.920 --> 27:30.560]  worked there in the 80s and translating and they said that there's just no way
[27:30.560 --> 27:36.940]  they would direct an airliner over a war zone absolutely not and it's not
[27:36.940 --> 27:41.600]  uncommon for example on Tuesday the 11th of September 2001 where they'll
[27:41.600 --> 27:45.400]  evacuate they'll tell everybody in the control tower to leave their position
[27:45.400 --> 27:49.440]  and send them into the space down below where there is no windows then no staff
[27:49.440 --> 27:54.160]  that control tower with black ops that happens all the time in Fallon Nevada the
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.360]  control tower area 51 Diego Garcia this happens you know it's not uncommon see
[27:58.360 --> 28:02.560]  that happens so if the controllers have no idea what's going on again
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.440]  repeating the compartmentalization of the federal government what is your gut as
[28:07.440 --> 28:13.720]  an air traffic controller tell you is going on over here with this Russia
[28:13.720 --> 28:20.360]  situation and this shoot down of this aircraft 11 years of the controller on
[28:20.360 --> 28:27.000]  my gut tells me that obviously there's a cover up on and again if you ask
[28:27.000 --> 28:31.440]  controllers in Europe chances are they were either removed or if they do talk
[28:31.440 --> 28:36.400]  about it they're going to be disappeared well there was a Spanish air traffic
[28:36.400 --> 28:41.920]  controller in Kiev this came out in the news and was even on Fox Latino but
[28:41.920 --> 28:46.000]  then got removed and David Knight covered this last Friday on the nightly
[28:46.000 --> 28:53.960]  news in land Macadam and not just this air traffic controller who was senior but
[28:53.960 --> 29:01.200]  others said that they were basically told to shut up and that it was shot down
[29:01.200 --> 29:08.200]  by Ukraine and that the same thing you just said that the day before they
[29:08.200 --> 29:13.920]  brought new controllers in who they'd never seen before who basically kicks
[29:13.920 --> 29:19.600]  them out when this happened and strange you said that because you just brought
[29:19.600 --> 29:22.840]  up basically with that Spanish air traffic controller said pretty bizarre
[29:22.840 --> 29:26.880]  what does that sound like to you exactly and that's their MO they've been doing
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.680]  it for a long time so it's nothing new so you're absolutely right you're dead
[29:31.680 --> 29:37.360]  on with your your what you're bringing up and my gut that's what my gut tells
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.280]  me to wow well thank you so much for the call Roy we're gonna go to grandpa

[32:58.520 --> 33:18.240]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones
[33:18.240 --> 33:30.160]  we're here six days a week Monday through Friday 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. central then we
[33:30.160 --> 33:36.840]  come back Sundays live 4 to 6 p.m. we have weekday info wars nightly news 7
[33:36.840 --> 33:44.440]  o'clock central every single night of the weekdays Monday through Friday because
[33:44.440 --> 33:50.280]  there's that much important news again I'm just a logical person but the public
[33:50.280 --> 33:57.000]  is ignorant about aircraft and just completely ignorant about airspace and
[33:57.000 --> 34:05.080]  so they really are being convinced in the polls that Vladimir Putin himself
[34:05.080 --> 34:10.320]  ordered a Malaysian airliner shot down because he wanted to kill 303 completely
[34:10.320 --> 34:14.840]  innocent people and so let's have a big cold war now and spend trillions of
[34:14.840 --> 34:19.400]  dollars and try to wreck Russia which will just wreck us as well and the
[34:19.400 --> 34:25.880]  globalists will go all the way to the bank whistling their way happily they
[34:25.880 --> 34:30.320]  don't want Russia setting up an alternative to the dollar and Russia and
[34:30.320 --> 34:34.920]  China have been begging for years for the globalists that run the U.S. and
[34:34.920 --> 34:40.400]  Europe to stop devaluing the dollar they're all invested in it they're all
[34:40.400 --> 34:44.200]  part of the system the communist Chinese almost every one of their generals is a
[34:44.200 --> 34:51.080]  billionaire their top generals and they're now calling it his Lockerbie
[34:51.080 --> 34:56.440]  moment like he's Gaddafi and in order to plane shot down turned out that was
[34:56.440 --> 35:05.640]  made up and Diane Feinstein is saying you know this is a new cold war and
[35:05.640 --> 35:10.760]  McCain is saying they'll be held to pay and Putin is saying we still have an
[35:10.760 --> 35:17.800]  ascertained who did this the rebels on our side are saying they didn't but we
[35:17.800 --> 35:25.360]  will are very sad for the plane being shot down and now you think the only
[35:25.360 --> 35:30.920]  people in the world are these 303 dead people from Malaysia and that the whole
[35:30.920 --> 35:35.960]  world history should change now just like a thousand plus died on the Lusitania
[35:35.960 --> 35:44.040]  to start World War one with the U.S. and Germany to get the U.S. into the war and
[35:44.040 --> 35:49.440]  then that killed millions of people and then there was the false flag of the
[35:49.440 --> 36:00.640]  Ford Foundation and British intelligence and the West openly with the Kaiser
[36:00.640 --> 36:05.680]  Velhom Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation this is all mainline public
[36:05.680 --> 36:12.280]  surprise winning books on this this is a fact created Hitler just like they've
[36:12.280 --> 36:18.080]  created Al Qaeda doesn't mean they run Al Qaeda they create it give it all the
[36:18.080 --> 36:24.680]  weapons and then turn Frankenstein loose I'm gonna go back to your phone calls
[36:24.680 --> 36:33.200]  it's just I'm really upset by this because the issue here is the globalist
[36:33.200 --> 36:38.040]  want to kill the dollar but they want then the world to adopt their SDR
[36:38.040 --> 36:44.680]  global carbon tax slash Tobin tax they're gonna have a tax on oil at the
[36:44.680 --> 36:52.360]  wellhead and all petrochemicals and its derivatives all the derivatives of oil
[36:52.360 --> 36:57.120]  distillates I guess this is all been announced decades ago they're following
[36:57.120 --> 37:01.080]  the plan a global tax on all human activity the carbon tax and a money
[37:01.080 --> 37:07.960]  usage tax a global money VAT on all digital uses of money that tracks
[37:07.960 --> 37:13.560]  everything in real time but more importantly controls it and taxes it and
[37:13.560 --> 37:20.360]  can turn off your card or your biometric ID to where you literally can buy nor
[37:20.360 --> 37:23.560]  sell give the globalist don't want you to operate that's why they're shutting
[37:23.560 --> 37:27.440]  down the lemonade stands and the farmers markets and SWAT teaming Amish that
[37:27.440 --> 37:33.680]  sell cheese to their neighbor because the great sin is not going into a big
[37:33.680 --> 37:38.520]  corporate box store or eating at a corporate chain it's now out on the
[37:38.520 --> 37:45.800]  news today what's well-known McDonald's Pizza Hut and KFC get most of their
[37:45.800 --> 37:53.400]  chicken from China and if you think the chicken from the United States is bad or
[37:53.400 --> 37:59.240]  the drugs produced here are bad 90 plus percent of drugs that are consumed in the
[37:59.240 --> 38:06.080]  US prescription drugs are made in China close to a third of the chicken now
[38:06.080 --> 38:12.920]  being shipped in and used here in the US is from China and ladies and gentlemen
[38:12.920 --> 38:17.040]  they were taking according to this report at the factories where they buy
[38:17.040 --> 38:26.480]  their chicken from 13-day old expired 13 days expired rotten chicken and
[38:26.480 --> 38:29.680]  grinding it up and adding all the different chemicals so you won't get
[38:29.680 --> 38:36.280]  food poisoning that's why they radiate the chicken because it's got feces all
[38:36.280 --> 38:41.080]  over it mites all over it you name it that's why they passed laws here to
[38:41.080 --> 38:47.560]  radiate the beef the poultry you name it and then not even label the fact that
[38:47.560 --> 38:53.720]  it's been irradiated because then they could feed you rotten slop but let me go
[38:53.720 --> 39:01.400]  further they spray on most meat in the US now unless it's choice cuts any process
[39:01.400 --> 39:07.320]  meat unless it's from an organic facility certified is sprayed with live
[39:07.320 --> 39:14.720]  virus okay I said I'm going to your calls is sprayed with live virus that in
[39:14.720 --> 39:24.280]  Latin translates into English bacteria eating virus and it is a vaccine live
[39:24.280 --> 39:29.560]  vaccine grown in giant tanks that is it sprayed on the meat and then the viruses
[39:29.560 --> 39:35.280]  eat the bacteria this is what you're eating others the headline FDA approved
[39:35.280 --> 39:41.200]  spray on virus to keep processed meats safe see it's not just that quote
[39:41.200 --> 39:47.320]  McDonald's is fattening or bad for you ladies and gentlemen it's that China is
[39:47.320 --> 39:52.280]  a collapsing hellhole and that's where I mean you do not want to eat food out of
[39:52.280 --> 39:55.920]  China remember the headline in the London Guardian and I'm going to your
[39:55.920 --> 40:03.800]  calls grandpa Liberty pilot Brendan John I'm going right to you I just have gone
[40:03.800 --> 40:06.600]  off on the Jag here
[40:06.600 --> 40:13.480]  it turns out the British the European the Chinese the US the Monsanto
[40:13.480 --> 40:20.120]  facilities none of them eat any of the food they all have secret organic farms
[40:20.120 --> 40:25.960]  with tents to even keep the chemicals in the air off the food and that's what
[40:25.960 --> 40:31.040]  they eat that's what the elite eats and you can look that up that communist
[40:31.040 --> 40:38.680]  Chinese elite have secret organic farms it's the same thing here okay that's how
[40:38.680 --> 40:43.640]  this works remember the headline German elite get clean vaccine remember that
[40:43.640 --> 40:48.520]  story five years ago this is all done on purpose you can understand that now
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.440]  let's go back to the pilots and folks grandpa Stan Liberty pilot Brendan
[40:53.440 --> 40:57.800]  John and others as soon as you hear one of these fellas hang up that's your
[40:57.800 --> 41:01.840]  chance to call in if you're an air traffic controller or a pilot they had
[41:01.840 --> 41:05.640]  said for two months don't fly over the zone that's an order they reassured the
[41:05.640 --> 41:09.680]  alert last Friday why was it and not other flights diverted through an air
[41:09.680 --> 41:15.160]  space with fighter bombers and bombers bombing Russian rebel targets what do
[41:15.160 --> 41:20.360]  you expect to happen now we don't even know the Russians did it probably did
[41:20.360 --> 41:25.280]  but the media is lying and saying they don't have these missiles in Ukraine in
[41:25.280 --> 41:31.840]  the west it turns out they do even a piece had to admit that the point is
[41:31.840 --> 41:35.840]  you're being lied to I'm being lied to grandpa stew is a pilot give us your
[41:35.840 --> 41:40.840]  take on this well my take is I'm just reading it off the website here it says
[41:40.840 --> 41:45.600]  Kiev based Hunter shot down the plane I'm so glad I have an opportunity to
[41:45.600 --> 41:50.160]  share with humanity the answers to these aviation questions there's a website
[41:50.160 --> 41:57.640]  out there called able danger abl danger net this guy's a former us green
[41:57.640 --> 42:01.880]  fighter pilot I think he's got 10 or 20,000 hours flying for Delta or
[42:01.880 --> 42:09.160]  something he's dedicated his life to uncover and explain to the world what
[42:09.160 --> 42:13.760]  these aviation questions are all about I've had that individual on and he has
[42:13.760 --> 42:18.680]  a partner to as a pilot as well but I believe those are whistleblowers or
[42:18.680 --> 42:23.720]  people exposing 9-11 right well they're exposing everything in aviation and and
[42:23.720 --> 42:28.400]  for him to be able to explain how Boeing has installed these remote control
[42:28.400 --> 42:32.360]  devices in the last I don't 12 years or so they actually already had them on a
[42:32.360 --> 42:36.160]  lot of aircraft before that but yeah they're ubiquitous now on all the new
[42:36.160 --> 42:40.720]  aircraft but they move the waypoints electronically so the poor pilots plan
[42:40.720 --> 42:46.080]  these planes doesn't know the 300 miles off course you think he's on course and
[42:46.080 --> 42:49.680]  when you start thinking about it explains an awful lot of airplanes being
[42:49.680 --> 42:53.560]  down wondering why they did this or did that is because they didn't know any
[42:53.560 --> 42:56.760]  better because electronically their devices were tricking them well that's
[42:56.760 --> 43:00.240]  right Bush it was even on PBS we found the clip a few months ago I remember
[43:00.240 --> 43:04.560]  seeing it he went on at a press conference said don't worry we have
[43:04.560 --> 43:08.640]  remote controls on all the new planes we'll we'll take and then a guy literally
[43:08.640 --> 43:11.880]  grabbed his arm behind him and like jerked on the president's arm like don't
[43:11.880 --> 43:16.880]  say that it's unbelievable well that's why there's lawsuits now against the
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.640]  pilots association because they know that the planes are rigged and the
[43:22.640 --> 43:26.760]  pilots don't want to fly these planes that they can lose control over but
[43:26.760 --> 43:30.080]  yeah whenever they had that plane crash what was it in San Francisco a few
[43:30.080 --> 43:35.800]  months ago it came out that pilots are crashing because because the computers
[43:35.800 --> 43:39.760]  that they're made to go on autopilot basically and then the autopilot
[43:39.760 --> 43:47.720]  screwing up and they're blaming the pilots but this captain Field McConnell
[43:47.720 --> 43:50.880]  he deserves some kind of an award because once you start reading his
[43:50.880 --> 43:55.320]  information oh my goodness it just explains so much in this aviation stuff
[43:55.320 --> 44:01.200]  so buckle your seatbelts folks able danger net the poor guy lives in Wisconsin
[44:01.200 --> 44:05.480]  Plum City not too far from Minneapolis St. Paul rhyme from and it's all there
[44:05.480 --> 44:10.280]  all you do is go look it up able danger net and that's my contribution to
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.160]  humanity and I'm so happy they had an opportunity to do this well thanks for
[44:14.160 --> 44:16.880]  coming on the broadcast yeah we should probably get that pilot back on the
[44:16.880 --> 44:21.200]  show believe I had him on like five years ago thank you so much yeah when
[44:21.200 --> 44:25.720]  you look at all this it's just this is the issue with driverless cars and
[44:25.720 --> 44:30.440]  driverless planes and a smart houses and everything being automated is the
[44:30.440 --> 44:36.020]  technocracy is run by the most anti-human wicked vicious people you can
[44:36.020 --> 44:42.960]  imagine that's why I'm against you know giving my daughters an iPhone with a
[44:42.960 --> 44:46.880]  fingerprint access to it that they're gonna make mandatory because then
[44:46.880 --> 44:50.880]  they're gonna be used to that to buy and sell people say but it's so convenient
[44:50.880 --> 44:56.120]  except it gives the system total control and then you say well I don't care I
[44:56.120 --> 45:02.760]  have nothing to hide there are people killed every minute who are nice
[45:02.760 --> 45:05.840]  walking down the street and get mugged or killed or raped who didn't do anything
[45:05.840 --> 45:12.160]  wrong and that's why nice people chumps are always victims of crime because they
[45:12.160 --> 45:16.840]  can't imagine it could happen to them I have friends that I had lost
[45:16.840 --> 45:24.280]  relationships over this is about ten years ago a friend where it was the
[45:24.280 --> 45:32.280]  Nigerian email scam and he said man my ships come in I'm gonna give $5,000 to
[45:32.280 --> 45:34.960]  this prince that's where everybody knew it was a total fraud people knew for
[45:34.960 --> 45:39.760]  years but it wasn't like widespread known there was a fraud and I guess got
[45:39.760 --> 45:45.840]  to send them $5,000 and I get a million and they believe their ship had come in
[45:45.840 --> 45:50.320]  even smart people have this gambler gene I guess in their brain where they just
[45:50.320 --> 45:55.040]  imagine you say no no that's a con but I've been around for about five years at
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.040]  the time about 15 years now and I said if you give them that money next they're
[46:00.040 --> 46:06.200]  gonna send any 10,000 because you know Prince of Boopy you know got got got you
[46:06.200 --> 46:09.440]  know blocked by the other crown prince but he'll be indebted with you and meet
[46:09.440 --> 46:13.080]  you at the rich Carlton in one month of you know with the with the five million
[46:13.080 --> 46:17.640]  now if you give them 10,000 and my friend was like well I've already given
[46:17.640 --> 46:21.440]  them 5,000 shut up you know you're just jealous that that I've had this
[46:21.440 --> 46:28.840]  opportunity us and they they they they got taken for about $15,000 and would
[46:28.840 --> 46:32.800]  never talk to me again and hated me because I told him it was a scam and
[46:32.800 --> 46:36.680]  they didn't want to ever admit it was a scam and they believed the bull just
[46:36.680 --> 46:42.920]  quit sending money to Nigerian woman gives Nigerian scammer fifty thousand
[46:42.920 --> 46:48.080]  five hundred thousand dollars after meeting him on Christian mingle calm that's
[46:48.080 --> 46:52.720]  from tech dirt see and I went out to hear some great rockabilly music a few
[46:52.720 --> 47:00.080]  months ago with Mike judge the movie producer and why I'm named Robin that's
[47:00.080 --> 47:03.880]  where I went with him there and it was at a place in East Austin and there were
[47:03.880 --> 47:08.640]  guys in there in African robes everyone bowing down to them that's where Mike

[47:22.440 --> 47:26.080]  important person I said really what's your name and I started googling it right
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.080]  there I just laughed at the guy and they got up and went out and had the guy open
[47:30.080 --> 47:33.400]  the door to their car and because I could see him at the window and he drove
[47:33.400 --> 47:37.880]  off and just everyone the white yuppies black people it was a black slash white

[47:57.240 --> 48:03.160]  car payment or my gas bill Brendan then John and then Liberty pilot Brendan
[48:03.160 --> 48:06.560]  thanks for calling in thanks for holding you're on the air you say you're in the
[48:06.560 --> 48:11.480]  Air Force what's your take on all this oh yes thank you Alex yes I was in the
[48:11.480 --> 48:19.320]  Air Force or in the early 90s it it's very possible that well first of all we
[48:19.320 --> 48:25.000]  have an aircraft that's on a projected flight path it's pretty much gonna stay
[48:25.000 --> 48:31.240]  on that path unless there's some extraneous circumstances that are gonna
[48:31.240 --> 48:38.800]  force it to have to fly around something like in the case of a 747 that has to
[48:38.800 --> 48:44.400]  fly around a volcano that has erupted I remember there was a story from the 80s
[48:44.400 --> 48:51.560]  where a 747 flew through an ash cloud at night time from a volcano and shut the
[48:51.560 --> 48:57.440]  engines down you know nowadays we have real-time information to let those
[48:57.440 --> 49:03.960]  pilots and crew plan for any anything in the way of the flight the project it's
[49:03.960 --> 49:08.800]  all plotted out for months don't fly over this area correct so the big
[49:08.800 --> 49:13.560]  question should be who directed the flight over it correct correct and
[49:13.560 --> 49:16.840]  there's reports that there were Ukrainian fighters that actually went up to
[49:16.840 --> 49:25.160]  altitude and possibly have nudged that Malaysian airliner you know so many miles
[49:25.160 --> 49:34.520]  each way above or below or within I should say the Lugansk-Donetsk region of
[49:34.520 --> 49:38.600]  Ukraine that way that way I've seen those reports that way there wouldn't be a
[49:38.600 --> 49:41.960]  record of the flight plan being changed they would just order them radio to
[49:41.960 --> 49:47.080]  radio absolutely absolutely so if if their projected flight path was okay
[49:47.080 --> 49:52.040]  well we know that's a war zone so let's fly above that war region or below the
[49:52.040 --> 49:56.640]  region and that will be our projected flight path and then when you're in
[49:56.640 --> 50:03.280]  that area those fighters come in and force you back into that war over that
[50:03.280 --> 50:09.440]  war zone and then break off and then you know it's that's shot down by a missile
[50:09.440 --> 50:15.720]  or or what at what have you so but what I'd like to call attention to is a short
[50:15.720 --> 50:23.240]  video that showed a it was either a pro-russian rebel or Ukrainian forces
[50:23.240 --> 50:30.640]  some guy that was off of a back of a truck with an armful of fresh passports
[50:30.640 --> 50:37.240]  a crisp passport I saw that I saw that I know none of this adds up I quite
[50:37.240 --> 50:41.000]  frankly again don't know what happened but I know it's war propaganda I know
[50:41.000 --> 50:45.160]  we don't need a new Cold War over this I know it's a war zone and I know that if
[50:45.160 --> 50:48.760]  it turns out to be the Russians I believe according to studying international law
[50:48.760 --> 50:54.160]  and seeing other shoot downs that it the blame goes on whoever directed that
[50:54.160 --> 50:58.600]  flight over a war zone I mean you're in the Air Force and you certainly and it
[50:58.600 --> 51:03.560]  seemed to know a lot about this but is that correct what I just said absolutely
[51:03.560 --> 51:08.160]  I I just believe that and I'm not pro-russia either but I just believe
[51:08.160 --> 51:12.040]  that why would they spend the time and the resources to prove that they didn't
[51:12.040 --> 51:18.560]  have anything to do with it you know and to prove to the rest of the world hey
[51:18.560 --> 51:22.960]  you know we we what what reason will we have to bring this airliner down so we
[51:22.960 --> 51:29.000]  could draw the attention of the West and the rest of the world on us you know
[51:29.000 --> 51:35.000]  Russia has a lot to lose if a major war is starting on that huge you know gas and
[51:35.000 --> 51:42.480]  oil deal or whatever there with China all of they stand a lot to lose by doing
[51:42.480 --> 51:50.560]  something stupid like that and and and inciting you know a conflict it just
[51:50.560 --> 51:55.760]  doesn't make any sense so I don't see I agree this this is Lusitania 2.0 great
[51:55.760 --> 51:59.680]  points thank you for calling in Brennan let's go ahead now and Dr. John in
[51:59.680 --> 52:03.880]  North Carolina who's a private pilot then we'll talk to Liberty pilots a
[52:03.880 --> 52:13.600]  commercial pilot go ahead go ahead John all right yeah yeah I'm gonna go back to
[52:13.600 --> 52:17.200]  John a minute he just got his radio on listening there's an internet delay plus
[52:17.200 --> 52:22.880]  we delay the show 10 seconds per FCC ladies and gentlemen that's why you
[52:22.880 --> 52:26.480]  heard delay when you're on the phone versus listening on the radio Liberty
[52:26.480 --> 52:37.640]  pilot you are on the air go ahead yes sir you guys are hitting it pretty much on the head somewhere in there they've I guess got some
[52:37.640 --> 52:46.280]  compartmentalization going on and somehow this happened but from the air defense
[52:46.280 --> 52:53.560]  point of view I used to work on air defense system back in the 90s and that
[52:53.560 --> 52:58.160]  system or tactical systems there you can't distinguish whether that's the
[52:58.160 --> 53:05.040]  airliner or a military aircraft and someone gives them the wrong information
[53:05.040 --> 53:10.480]  or anything or if like those aircrafts you say were above or below that air
[53:10.480 --> 53:17.760]  space where that airplane was flying radar could you know if the aircraft
[53:17.760 --> 53:25.200]  that's flying and the military aircraft it was on nearly the same heading you
[53:25.200 --> 53:33.480]  know one could mistake one for the other and the system hit the wrong aircraft I
[53:33.480 --> 53:37.840]  just know that and we've had air traffic controllers call in Air Force
[53:37.840 --> 53:41.600]  pilots you name it and of course you've been a commercial pilot and former air
[53:41.600 --> 53:47.120]  defense and it's just you do not fly over a war zone and then you got to ask
[53:47.120 --> 53:51.960]  why on earth was that Malaysian aircraft over that and there are reports
[53:51.960 --> 53:56.640]  coming out from credible sources of the Ukrainian fighter jets in and around it
[53:56.640 --> 54:00.080]  they could have forced it in there they could have been around it to confuse it
[54:00.080 --> 54:04.160]  or they might have been going up to see what it was it could be the pilot made a
[54:04.160 --> 54:09.280]  mistake but I mean we're flying around war zones I mean a regular pilot get an
[54:09.280 --> 54:14.880]  assessment checks their flight plan five or six times commercial pilots I mean I've
[54:14.880 --> 54:19.240]  been on private jets and you name it known pilots of large passenger liners
[54:19.240 --> 54:22.800]  and they checked their flight plan like ten times new radically because that's
[54:22.800 --> 54:26.760]  how you don't make mistakes is over and over again you know walk through things
[54:26.760 --> 54:32.400]  and I just do not buy it and it's really weird now that you had the disappearing
[54:32.400 --> 54:36.840]  Malaysian aircraft and this one and another one that just flew over Syrian
[54:36.840 --> 54:42.760]  area where there's a no-fly zone right in the rebel held area so something is
[54:42.760 --> 54:46.720]  going on and it might be at Malaysian Airlines I mean I mean I don't know
[54:46.720 --> 54:50.560]  maybe there are a bunch of morons but I don't think that's the case I don't know
[54:50.560 --> 54:54.240]  enough about Malaysian Airlines I know they fly over the world and didn't have
[54:54.240 --> 54:57.720]  a bad history before I looked it up so what does that sound like to you as a
[54:57.720 --> 55:05.720]  commercial pilot's going on I don't know Alex just something's going on there
[55:05.720 --> 55:11.920]  and I was wondering the same thing about that Malaysian airline so seems like
[55:11.920 --> 55:16.000]  they're a target airline for incidents all of a sudden yeah all right well
[55:16.000 --> 55:19.840]  thank you so much for the call sir by the way they just found a CBS news piece
[55:19.840 --> 55:24.320]  that I'll watch during the next break and find out what they're saying that
[55:24.320 --> 55:31.240]  where the Malaysian Airlines defends their war zone flight path so maybe
[55:31.240 --> 55:34.360]  that's why they're the target airline because they'll they'll play along with
[55:34.360 --> 55:38.960]  it because you're not supposed to fly through there how would the air traffic
[55:38.960 --> 55:47.640]  controllers in Europe allow them to set that flight plan that's another question
[55:47.640 --> 55:53.520]  airlines can't set the flight plan if it goes through areas that are restricted
[55:53.520 --> 56:00.120]  airspace we're going to go to break and come back with Tom in Baltimore worked
[56:00.120 --> 56:03.680]  with helicopter units and police wants to talk about it and then we're gonna get
[56:03.680 --> 56:09.600]  a when Spencer on from American patrol with video Skype at the border across
[56:09.600 --> 56:15.720]  from a drug smuggling base that is actually on video the Skype was very
[56:15.720 --> 56:20.720]  clear this morning we'll see how it is when we go live in the next segment with
[56:20.720 --> 56:26.920]  Glenn Spencer after we take a call or two but this is amazing stuff by the way
[56:26.920 --> 56:32.600]  we've been out it's not artificial scarcity it's it's scarcity the best way
[56:32.600 --> 56:36.560]  to sell something is to have it be high quality product and be in demand and be
[56:36.560 --> 56:41.200]  reasonably priced and competitive but also to have that Christmas toy
[56:41.200 --> 56:44.720]  phenomenon where companies have been caught over and over again it's been in
[56:44.720 --> 56:48.320]  the news going and buying up the first ship mother toy paying off local
[56:48.320 --> 56:54.120]  newscasters to say oh you know this toy is sold out and people are fighting over
[56:54.120 --> 57:00.720]  it that will cause a run on it well that's not what's happened with survival
[57:00.720 --> 57:06.120]  shield and then survival shield x2 and the other products they really have
[57:06.120 --> 57:10.120]  sold out and we really were unable sometimes to get the of the super high
[57:10.120 --> 57:15.840]  quality product and produce it we've been out for two and a half months of the
[57:15.840 --> 57:24.480]  silver bullet silver bullet I mean it is the most powerful hard to get purest
[57:24.480 --> 57:29.560]  silver the laboratory we use is the best in the country we are neurotic about the
[57:29.560 --> 57:33.800]  highest quality and it is less than the leading competitors and it is the best
[57:33.800 --> 57:38.720]  coil silver out there it is very strong though folks so I only use it when I'm
[57:38.720 --> 57:42.640]  sick as I don't think this is for regular use now other people you know say
[57:42.640 --> 57:48.200]  that I don't say that okay and consult your physician silver bullet is back we
[57:48.200 --> 57:54.200]  have a limited supply because it's hard to make this stuff and it's dangerous to
[57:54.200 --> 58:00.920]  use high voltage and you know the lab we're using is a big one and really
[58:00.920 --> 58:05.120]  nobody else out there can move this much silver so the point is is that we've
[58:05.120 --> 58:10.200]  got a limited amount and they're trying to make us more now it'll probably take
[58:10.200 --> 58:13.160]  another two three months to make it I think at the way it's sold last time
[58:13.160 --> 58:16.920]  it'll be sold out in two weeks to a month if you want the silver bullet or
[58:16.920 --> 58:22.280]  want to stock up on it info wars life dot com colloidal silver I take it
[58:22.280 --> 58:26.920]  topically and internally when I'm sick antibiotics would work on my dad or me

[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:02.720]  news and doing research and watching discovery channel history channel and my
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:08.240]  dad being a pilot and flying in the cockpit with other pilots that somebody
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:14.280]  ordered that plane through that restricted airspace or it's the Malaysian
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:19.180]  Airlines fault and they're now saying they directed it through there but
[01:01:19.180 --> 01:01:26.360]  airlines can't direct you through a no fly zone folks when I was a kid of my
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:31.160]  dad even got near airspace they would say identify yourself when you were three
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.680]  miles away from it and he'd say I'm flying through here blah blah blah to go
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:40.800]  here and I go thank you you know just such and such and I remember one time
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:44.520]  those some storms because they pop up in the summer and I remember them saying
[01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:48.360]  oh you can go ahead and fly over our airspace you know fly on heading such
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:52.320]  and such and such but sometimes they'd say nope you can't fly you know by here
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.480]  and I'd have to land as I said earlier that was my experience we just confirmed
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.520]  it with all these pilots and air traffic controllers and people but again where
[01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:05.960]  are the headlines asking all this let's talk to Tom in Baltimore than Ron John
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:10.240]  and others go ahead Tom very good afternoon mr. Jones I just want to
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:14.680]  elaborate a little bit on what one of your previous callers had stated about
[01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:23.560]  the jets possibly shuttling that craft over a bit I had thought that since day
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:29.000]  one that that might be a possibility I had that in mind because when I was a
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.960]  police officer we would have a lot of local news helicopters figure out from
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.880]  time to time where our tank units are operating and when I was in tech usually
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:45.320]  we were doing sensitive operations we didn't want them shattering us everywhere
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:48.840]  we went they were getting where our position so we would call one of our
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:54.960]  helicopters to come and they didn't have to contact them by radio they would
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:03:01.400]  spot them up at night sometimes or they would just fly by and nudge them my
[01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:08.120]  thinking is if you've got several fighter jets flying aggressively by your
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.000]  plane you're not gonna have to have any radio contact whatsoever which might be
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.400]  what they had in mind you're gonna you're clear of where those fighter jets are
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:22.560]  operating the same way the news helicopters would clear out when our
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:28.120]  chopper would buzz them or spot them up it makes perfect sense and you have no
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:33.600]  record of any communication telling them to do anything they would just do it
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:42.040]  wow what is your gut overall tell you's going on here you know I'll tell you
[01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:46.600]  what you can't believe anything that you hear from the politicians or the news
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:51.120]  or we used to call it in court through the poisonous tree you know once they
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:55.560]  tell you and feed you so many lies you can't take anything that they say as
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:04:00.040]  factual or truthful at all you know they've done it to themselves so it's
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:07.280]  really a guessing game it certainly though appears that like you said you
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.960]  know we've traditionally not been big fans this country of Russia but they
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:18.360]  certainly seem to be operating in the way that we had always strived to operate
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:24.560]  they're doing things that the United States used to do when I was a younger
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:30.520]  man and I can't fault them for that so you know right now the credibility has
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.680]  to go with them I mean that's just called to us it I agree with you plus they
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:40.000]  don't stand a game from shooting this airliner down that's a big one right
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]  there I mean look who stands to gain and how the war propaganda was so ready we
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.320]  got Glenn Spencer coming up if you guys can hold Ron John and Clay I want to

[01:08:27.840 --> 01:08:32.120]  Foundation for 60 years they've taught in Latin America that the US is evil and
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:38.080]  must fall and that socialism is the way to go to create a anti-Americanism that
[01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:43.160]  can be attached to the Democratic Party now Obama has implemented the planned
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:50.600]  implosion of the border that Glenn Spencer at American Patrol calm American
[01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:56.240]  Border Patrol has predicted year after year after year you've heard him here I
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:01.600]  know at least 12 13 years he's no longer than that he's been coming on about 15
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:07.560]  years and he's the first guy to launch drones on the border even before the
[01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.600]  government did he moved from California right there to Arizona we have an
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:14.840]  incredible video feed if you're a listener on the radio you can go to

[01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:23.360]  your quote smartphones and you can see the HD video I mean his Skype is just
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:28.400]  incredibly clear and you can see the Mexican border right behind him and the
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:35.080]  drug cartel smuggling shack for people and drugs and he has predicted this all
[01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:40.360]  along a collapse of the border the de facto amnesty causing a giant flood
[01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:45.520]  and then race war being implemented as the next phase to break the country up
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:50.520]  he's warned of Mecha, La Raza, all of it and the Spanish media is promoting this
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:55.800]  most Hispanics that I know are just absolutely against this and are very
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:00.280]  patriotic Americans but the Latin Americans and the Mexicans a large
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:04.680]  percentage of them just really believe it and they've been sold that it's
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.440]  kosher and acceptable so he joins us now from the border to break down what's
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:15.320]  happening there now Lin Spencer but also to give us his take on how he
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.520]  predicted this in hundreds of articles videos and thousands of interviews
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:23.120]  dozens of them here he's probably been with us over a hundred times Glenn I
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:27.880]  tell you when I first heard interviewing you back in like 1999 and

[01:10:38.800 --> 01:10:44.040]  Ford Foundation I think it's even worse than what you said thanks for having me
[01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:49.800]  on and hello from the from the Arizona Mexico border and over my right
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.800]  shoulder and to your left you'll might be able to see a building down there
[01:10:53.800 --> 01:11:01.640]  that is a warehouse used by the Mexican cartels to store their drugs let's talk
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.800]  a little bit about where you live and what you've seen and and then get your
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:10.280]  expert take on what this Obama operation is our reporters proved five weeks ago
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:15.320]  with drudge report calm and that indeed the border patrol gets them off the
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:19.000]  buses loads them on buses gives them vouchers and drops them wherever they
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:24.560]  want to go inside the interior right well I'm on the Mexican border I'm I
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:30.960]  have a ranch I gave up on California 12 years ago Alex I came out here to do the
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:34.920]  battle right on the front line I ended up with a ranch a little over a hundred
[01:11:34.920 --> 01:11:41.720]  acres right here my neighbor to the south is Mexico what you see it to the
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:49.680]  back of me is the San Pedro River that flows out of Mexico north to the Gila
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:56.320]  River then into the Colorado and it is a major smuggling corridor right now
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.920]  there are probably people in there carrying drugs what I have done since I
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:06.880]  started down here we started up American border patrol and you're right we
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.560]  patrol the border we send video we were the first to use unmanned aerial
[01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:16.720]  vehicles here on the border we are the reason the American the US border patrol
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.800]  started using them because we embarrassed them about 10 years ago 11 years
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:25.440]  ago we shamed them into doing it we've got a lot of things of course you'll
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:30.960]  never know about us because the mainstream media refuse to report on what
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:36.120]  we do if you go on American border patrol common you look over to the left
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.160]  you'll see a little red arrow if you click on that people are amazed that
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:44.880]  what opens up is a map of the southwest and every one of the border patrol
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:49.720]  sectors now you can click on a sector and a map will pop up and you can see a
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:55.320]  code that shows what's on the border what kind of fence is down there then you
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.880]  see little dots little numbers and you can click on that and you can get an
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:06.200]  actual aerial photograph of what the border fence looks like from Brownsville
[01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:11.360]  Texas the Gulf of Mexico all the way out to the Pacific Ocean this is the best
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:16.600]  kept secret in America you and people go in and they click on that and their
[01:13:16.600 --> 01:13:21.760]  mouse drop open they say that's not a fence you can step right over it most
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:27.880]  of what it is down there is just that now my neighbor over here John Ladd he
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:34.920]  has 10 miles of frontage on the Mexican border they built a fence that is so
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:42.240]  cheap you can cut through it in 20 minutes and I've been John is a good
[01:13:42.240 --> 01:13:49.400]  friend of mine he has had in the last 18 months 42 times they have cut through
[01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:56.120]  his fence driven drugs loads across his ranch cut fences his cows are all over
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:02.840]  the place and they caught one load never caught anybody so that'll tell you
[01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:08.840]  that's right there a major drug cartel smuggling operation Americans don't
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:13.800]  know now in Texas it's reported today by Fox News the border patrol was fired on
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.920]  by automatic weapons fire suppressive fire to get the shipments of illegals
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.640]  across I guess we delivered to the border patrol and the border patrol
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:27.200]  basically had to run and hide and reportedly the rules of engagement are
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:32.480]  just stand down and let the drug cartels attack you I mean this is just out of
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:37.560]  control they're sitting ducks in the river there you know we just flew down
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:42.800]  there I was down in June and I went back last week with a local photographer from
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.800]  our newspaper here I hired him to go with me because we couldn't believe what
[01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:52.240]  we saw I could I took a GoPro camera and flew along the real Grand River in my
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:57.400]  Cessna 206 hanging out the up on the wing and I got back I looked at that
[01:14:57.400 --> 01:15:02.200]  video and I said what first of all I flew for 40 miles and saw one border
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:09.400]  patrol a patrol boat but I got back and I saw all these there there are fences on
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:13.960]  top of the levee remember a levee's there to stop the river from running off of
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:20.680]  its banks in flooding the inland farms and in towns now a levee can also be
[01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:25.160]  used to stop people from flooding over the banks of the river and they
[01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:30.880]  actually started back in 2007 to build fences on top of those levees and they
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:36.360]  spent hundreds of millions of dollars doing that and we I was there we did an
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:42.640]  aerial survey part of our operation beef back in 2009 and you can go on American
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:46.280]  Border Patrol and look at that map I was telling you about look at some of those
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:51.560]  pictures of the immense enormous construction projects that they were
[01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:55.740]  building up the walls next to the levee then backfilling them so they could
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:16:00.720]  have a fence and that would stop everybody well I went back with my GoPro
[01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:05.280]  camera and I flew along and here were all these these fences but there were huge
[01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:10.880]  gaps in them and I couldn't figure out what they were so I took a photographer
[01:16:10.880 --> 01:16:17.520]  with a zoom lens and we went back there and we found out after landing and
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:21.640]  talking to some border patrol agents and getting some ground photographs there
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:27.240]  there were supposed to be electric gates installed on those fences but Obama
[01:16:27.240 --> 01:16:33.720]  didn't install them they have every quarter of a mile there's a there's a
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:38.960]  hole in the fence 40 feet wide and again let's be clear Latin America is
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:44.040]  literally collapsing right now our country's going into a depression Glenn I
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:49.120]  want to pull back though and talk about the big picture you predicted that they
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:52.800]  would just dissolve the border and that it would cause a giant flood years ago
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:56.880]  so tell us what's happening currently and what you predict will happen next
[01:16:56.880 --> 01:17:03.120]  well before he was elected and you can go on my site and you can see my quote
[01:17:03.120 --> 01:17:10.280]  I said before he was elected the first time back in 2008 I said Barack Obama is
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:14.920]  the most dangerous person ever to set foot on the American political stage
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:21.720]  his election to presidency would amount to national suicide and that's because I
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.680]  studied him and I know the subject and I know how close he was to the National
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:31.520]  Council of La Raza I know how he was trained by Saul Olinsky and that crowd
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.960]  and I knew that he was embedded with these people and I knew what he was
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:42.600]  going to do before he was elected too bad John McCain didn't know it now talk
[01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:51.200]  about the current thrust back in August of 2012 he passed this deferred action
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:57.440]  for children of alias DACA now we had a friend that monitors the border traffic
[01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:02.320]  down south of Tucson and they were getting about 10 in this little area
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:12.400]  about 10 actions per day after after August 15th 2012 it jumped to over 100
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:19.880]  per day and that was the red result of this DACA action and even a the next
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:25.400]  year a senator a Mexican female senator came out and said we're having a
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:32.960]  people rush for the border because of this new policy and senator Cruz was on
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:39.480]  Fox News Sunday yesterday and he pointed out he said this has nothing to do with
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:44.600]  the 2008 law signed by Bush this has everything to do with that DACA
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:49.240]  announcement and the word that he spread sure around the world south of the
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:53.440]  border sure and it turns out there's the deal with Guatemala and Mexico to have
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:58.080]  Mexico open up its border something has never done before and so I guess the big
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:02.440]  plan is to get so many tens of millions of new people up here they just in the
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.480]  border completely in North American Union no question about it there is that
[01:19:06.480 --> 01:19:11.520]  is the plan and there are other detailed things where he has passed regulations
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:17.200]  and issued orders that the border patrol is not to touch anyone who happens to
[01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:21.040]  have a child who is an illegal alien in their custody even though they're
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:27.240]  illegal so he has passed a multitude of presidential orders that essentially
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:31.480]  dissolve our border and it allows the exploitation of children no one knows
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:36.640]  who they are I mean this is such a crime on so many fronts it's incredible this

[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:40.600]  Glenn I want to get you back on for a full hour the next few weeks now that

[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.960]  earlier flood was bad I'm predicting the next floods gonna be even bigger and
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.800]  then bigger and then Obama will use the crisis to federalize the Southwest
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:17.240]  all right Alex a lot of people complain about the problem and report on the
[01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:21.160]  problem but what we've been focusing on our solutions whether it was our
[01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:26.040]  unmanned aerial vehicle our special cameras our survey but we have come up
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.520]  with a solution we have the solution to this system we call it the sonic barrier
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:35.560]  or identifies and we invented this patent dispending should be an issue
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:41.680]  shortly we have a system that can be buried in the ground solar powered
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:48.160]  cannot be seen that will count everybody who crosses the border and alert
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:53.840]  where they are and how many it will detect ultra light aircraft it is the
[01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:59.800]  cheapest thing going we have developed it I actually had to set up a private
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:03.680]  company because we had to patent it remember even working on this what five
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:10.000]  six years oh absolutely no we we I've been working on the idea for 12 years I
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:16.640]  ran a seismic oil exploration company in Montana financed it started it up ran it
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:21.640]  successfully for Arco Chevron and Texaco and it is an application of oil
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:28.040]  exploration seismic technology you can go on border technology calm and look at
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:32.720]  that video it'll blow your mind but the media will not tell you we have a
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:38.840]  solution to the border we can find we can detect and identify everybody who
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.520]  crosses the border from San Diego to Brownsville and a fraction of the cost
[01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:47.760]  of what they're using today we can do it and I hope your guy comes down and
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:52.080]  visits us and we'll show them demonstrations I'll fly the ultra light
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:56.640]  aircraft over the system and alarm will yeah listen you tell us when we get
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:27:02.000]  off the phone here or the video in a minute and we will come and we will
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.680]  definitely you'll come next week I'll send Joe Biggs and one of our camera
[01:27:06.680 --> 01:27:10.840]  people there next week for a couple days you can give us all the tour we'll do
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.080]  live feeds from there with you but I remember you told me about this six
[01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:19.480]  seven years ago and all the military people you've got on your board is it
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:24.600]  this based on on military type technology no it's well oil company but
[01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:30.720]  yeah let me say this one of the big five DOD contractors has been working on
[01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:36.560]  this with us for 18 months they say it's the best thing they've ever seen but
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:42.400]  they're frightened they actually recommended that the US border patrol
[01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.160]  uses technology down in Texas and after they recommended it they stopped talking
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:52.040]  to us now you have to understand this is the best damn system anybody's ever
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:56.280]  thought of yeah I can prove it to your guy who comes down I can show them all
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:00.320]  the private no I know I know because I know the military special awesome people
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:05.600]  use use use seismic stuff to track I got it I got an email from a Ramco Saudi
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:12.320]  a Ramco asking us to bring this system over there now this is the best but you
[01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:17.720]  won't see it anywhere because it is so good that the government is frightened
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.920]  to death of it no I understand I mean the seismic is one of the most accurate
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:25.920]  gauges out there and they can pick up they know the human pattern the
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:29.200]  computer knows the fingerprint and they'll know how many people where they're
[01:28:29.200 --> 01:28:34.000]  at and just boom right there but it would see ours is this is a patented
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:42.480]  approach we can detect one person walking 600 feet away wow the border
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:49.160]  patrol uses seismic sensors they use one per sensor we use 12 240 foot wide
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:56.160]  ear we use a powerful algorithm stuff that nobody's ever thought of before we
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:00.400]  can detect be ultralight every time what our government cannot detect ultralights
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:05.880]  they're coming over maybe 150 200 a year just in Arizona they can't detect them
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:10.200]  they know we can look at how Barrett got made in a guy's garage it's inventors
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.160]  and scientists like you Glenn Spencer you really are amazing I mean there you
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:18.320]  were making all that money at an oil company and and then you decided to fight
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:24.280]  for national sovereignty what was that like 15 years ago 20 years ago Alex I
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:32.680]  found out how to make a small fortune on the border start with a large one hey
[01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.000]  listen I'm gonna get Rob do to call you in a few minutes I want to set up
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:40.320]  sending our guy there next week and we'll have you on with our crew Glenn
[01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:44.440]  Spencer thank you so much American Border Patrol calm thanks a lot thank you
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:50.160]  so much we'll be right back with the Matt dredge special we're on the March the
[01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:57.400]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:59.080 --> 01:30:02.760]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:07.560]  family so much get healthy and detoxify most people know that iodine
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.920]  deficiency has been a crisis around the world iodine is key to so many of the
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:17.360]  body's functions especially the thyroid I discovered a product being developed by
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:22.560]  Dr. Group you now know it as survival shield true nascent iodine that your
[01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:26.560]  body can really absorb then about a year ago he said listen if you think this is
[01:30:26.560 --> 01:30:31.560]  powerful I'm going to come out with rare earth deep earth crystals and the
[01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:36.920]  results that I personally have had have been life-changing nobody else has got
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.400]  iodine based on these pure crystals ladies and gentlemen this is innovating
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:46.160]  and the best part is it helps fund info wars.com the radio show the TV show the
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.920]  whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas for a limited time

[01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:12.360]  toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:16.400]  of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:20.480]  inside using toxic chemicals within their homes there are more than 42

[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.800]  research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:39.960]  lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but

[01:33:30.880 --> 01:33:35.640]  phone calls with pilots and others calling in all agreeing so far that
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:39.240]  no they had to direct that plane into that war zone to be shot down and that
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:43.840]  that's the real scandal people say why are you defending Russia I just go where
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:49.120]  the truth is my job is really easy I mean if I even halfway hold back on
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:53.120]  something I can't sleep at night folks I'm that kind of person call it goody
[01:33:53.120 --> 01:33:58.400]  two-shoes whatever I just have real problems lying to people or distorting
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:07.200]  things even if it hurts me even if it hurts me so I'm just going where the
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:11.640]  truth is that's what makes me feel good and I guess I'm selfish you know I I
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:17.040]  should go along with Hillary and Obama and won a war with Russia I guess what
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:19.680]  you know we need a new world war I guess you know I'm a bad person I
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:24.320]  apologize now I want to go to this special report that I put together with
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:32.480]  Darren McBreen talking about Matt Drudge and I intro it but the reason I'm
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:39.040]  doing this is because we have to celebrate heroes of independence heroes of
[01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:43.640]  the little guy the underdog dominating that's what America is about that's what
[01:34:43.640 --> 01:34:46.960]  renaissance is about that's what freedoms about that's where almost
[01:34:46.960 --> 01:34:52.160]  everything good comes from and Matt Drudge literally has changed the course
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:56.040]  of history with the type of news he covers and carries so that the
[01:34:56.040 --> 01:35:00.400]  establishment the New York Times and MSNBC can't set the narrative and the
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:07.240]  Pentagon talks about this the Pentagon talks about this so that's why I've
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:11.000]  gone back to this speech from the archives and then backed it up with
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:14.440]  documentation after we air it here we'll post the video for everybody at
[01:35:14.440 --> 01:35:18.280]  info wars.com and prismplanet.com and I'll tweet it out as well but but I'm
[01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.960]  premiering it here it's not up on YouTube yet it'll be up there in about an
[01:35:20.960 --> 01:35:27.240]  hour here it is Matt Drudge predicted the future Matt Drudge top futurist here
[01:35:27.240 --> 01:35:33.800]  it is it's been more than 16 years since Matt Drudge gave his historic speech
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.920]  at the National Press Club on June 2nd 1998 at that time he said that the
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:44.960]  mainstream media would go bankrupt that individual bloggers and researchers on
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.800]  the internet were just as important as the New York Times the controlled
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:55.760]  state-run media had a field day making fun of Matt Drudge but today their
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:36:01.560]  hubris has drained away and they're no longer as arrogant as they once were now
[01:36:01.560 --> 01:36:06.800]  we see calls for the FCC to regulate print news and online news and we see
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.840]  establishment publications like Time Magazine Newsweek and the New York Times
[01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:18.040]  battling to keep from going completely bankrupt and imploding it turns out
[01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:23.440]  pretty much everything that Matt Drudge said in that 40 minute speech has now
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:28.400]  come true well Matt Drudge is saying a lot of things today that the mainstream
[01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:32.560]  media is still laughing at why do they laugh at people that have been proven
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:37.040]  right over and over again here are some of the most important moments in my view
[01:36:37.040 --> 01:36:42.280]  from Drudge's speech and we're also adding headlines from over the years to
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:48.880]  show just how much of what he had to say came true this is something new this
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:56.520]  marks the first time that an individual has access to the news wires outside of
[01:36:56.520 --> 01:37:04.840]  a newsroom you get to read all the news from the Associated Press UPI Reuters to
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:09.520]  the more okay the moral cane agency French press in the Shenhua I'm a
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:17.120]  personal fan of the Shenhua press and time was only newsrooms had access to
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:23.800]  the full pictures of the day's events but now any citizen does we get to see
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:30.200]  the kinds of cuts that are made for all kinds of reasons endless layers of
[01:37:30.200 --> 01:37:34.400]  editors with endless agendas changing bits and pieces so by the time the
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:41.440]  newspaper hits your welcome mat it had no meaning now with a modem anyone can
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:49.520]  follow the world and report on the world no middleman no big brother and I guess
[01:37:49.520 --> 01:37:53.440]  this changes everything more than 10 years after breaking the Clinton
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:58.360]  Lewinsky story Matt Drudge remains more powerful than ever with his website the
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:38:02.640]  drudgerport.com. Matt Drudge is a legend on the internet every journalist and
[01:38:02.640 --> 01:38:07.840]  politician in America reads his website on a daily basis when radio lost out to
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:15.240]  television there was anxiety the people in the radio business were absolutely
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:22.520]  anxious and demanded government stop the upcoming television wave television was
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:30.760]  very nervous about other mediums coming forward cable the movies were didn't want
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:35.680]  sitcoms to be taped at movie studios for fear it would take away from the movies
[01:38:35.680 --> 01:38:41.000]  no television save the movies the internet is going to save the news
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.440]  business
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:51.040]  well I envision of a future where there'll be 300 million reporters or
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:55.600]  anyone from anywhere can report for any reason it's freedom of participation
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:00.600]  absolutely realized first of all you just respected me this badge and my
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:05.320]  department you understand me when I'm talking to you you shut your mouth and
[01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:09.560]  you listen did I not give you a warning you gave me a warning right in the
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:16.200]  United States I know my right you mean the board obviously your parents don't
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.840]  put a foot in your butt quite enough cuz you don't understand the meaning
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:22.160]  respect
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:29.440]  you see this yes just see this I took the boy you have a problem with it bring

[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:39.080]  with the cremation of care frankly that's that I don't think that's
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:42.840]  something I need to talk to you about really that's right well I'm Alex Jones
[01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:46.520]  and I snuck in there in 2000 I'm the guy that blew it wide open and got the
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:51.120]  video it's been on national TV well I disrespect you for that you do I do but
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:53.920]  it's a lot of big public officials going in there you don't we deserve to know

[01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:59.200]  film but if you go in there with an understanding you violated that
[01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.280]  understanding by releasing that film and I don't respect you for that really
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:06.520]  I'm sorry you took an understanding when you went in there that you would not

[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.600]  inside my apartment sir I'm inside my part of the first lady of the United
[01:42:35.600 --> 01:42:41.560]  States recently addressed concerns about internet during a cyber spatial
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:50.200]  millennium project press conference just weeks after Lewinsky broke she said
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:56.440]  we're all going to have to rethink how we deal with the internet as exciting as
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:43:00.960]  these new developments are there are a number of serious issues without any
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:06.000]  kind of editing function or gay keeping function I wonder who she was referring
[01:43:06.000 --> 01:43:14.800]  to Mrs. Clinton continued anytime an individual leaps so far ahead of that
[01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:21.000]  balance and throws a system whatever it might be political economic technological
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:29.120]  out of balance you got a problem it can lead to all kinds of bad outcomes which
[01:43:29.120 --> 01:43:35.080]  we have seen historically we we are in an information war and we are losing
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:40.680]  that war what she have said the same thing about Ben Franklin or Thomas Edison
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:47.000]  or Henry Ford or Einstein they all left so far ahead out that they shook the
[01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:56.120]  balance no I say to these people faster not slower create let your mind flow let
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:01.200]  the imagination take over and if technology has finally caught up with
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:08.440]  individual liberty why would anyone who loves freedom want to rethink that if
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:11.560]  you're an undersecretary at the energy department and you're doing interview
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:15.560]  when you say one thing you know during if you could end up being on the front
[01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:23.880]  page of drudge anyone saying anything can can get caught up in in the spin
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:28.000]  cycle in a way that is very damaged you know it will it hurts what we're trying
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:30.720]  to do in database but also is very damaged that individual person and we
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:36.000]  cannot hide our bad news stories bad news gets out one way or the other and we
[01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:40.280]  must come to terms with telling the bad stories as well as the good when bad
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:44.880]  things happen the American people should hear it from us not as a scoop on the
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:50.840]  drug report the editor of Civilization Magazine Adam Goodheart wrote a great
[01:44:50.840 --> 01:44:55.960]  op-ed in the New York Times talking about is this really something new this
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:01.360]  type of fast reporting this competitive I'm very competitive I'm more part of
[01:45:01.360 --> 01:45:09.520]  the headline generation he maintains it was a going back to our foundations when
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:14.200]  the press was found in quite a different atmosphere when the press would report
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:17.360]  that the president's mother was a common prostitute brought over by the British
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:28.200]  Army imagine if someone did that now we have a great tradition of freedom of the
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:33.160]  press in this country unpopular press if the first lady is concerned about this
[01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:38.080]  internet cycle what would she have done during the heyday when there was 12 13
[01:45:38.080 --> 01:45:42.480]  editions of a paper in one day what would she have done with that news cycle
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:47.920]  that's the foundation that's what makes this club great is the tradition and I
[01:45:47.920 --> 01:45:53.880]  think we have a tradition of of provocative press and that I maintain
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:58.440]  that I'm the new new face on that I'll take that for a season but a lot of the
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:01.760]  stuff I do is serious stuff I was first to report that the encryption was
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.360]  missing from a morale satellite for example a couple weeks ago I didn't see
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:11.220]  the main press reporting that one so I'm not everything I do is gossip or
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:16.800]  bedroom to the contrary I think that's just an easy label to dismiss me and to
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:22.200]  dismiss the new medium but I'm I'm I'm excited about the launch of this
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:26.440]  internet medium and I I get freedom of the press belongs to anyone who owns
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:34.080]  one tonight the drugs report and info wars are once again in the crosshairs
[01:46:34.080 --> 01:46:39.720]  as the US government seeks to regulate conservative media via election laws
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:44.880]  Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist whose stories often make their
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:49.120]  way from his website info wars where on any day you can find headlines about
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:54.600]  vaccines mass fluoridation and the 9-11 cover-up into the so-called mainstream
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:59.160]  GOP establishment Alex Jones was a champion of Clive and Bundy from the
[01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:04.280]  very beginning because he's saying he'll do whatever he has to not be you know
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.000]  have his grazing rights stolen by these pirates
[01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:12.200]  drudge elevated the story and it made its way onto Fox News's airways next thing
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:16.040]  you know so-called mainstream Republicans are calling people like this
[01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:20.960]  patriots the conservative website that's called the drugs report pulled out all
[01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:26.200]  the stops today to promote a big new bombshell video today the leading
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:32.640]  conservative websites headline was this civil war Senate to go for handguns I'm
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:36.040]  an addict I'm a drudge addict I said my homepage is actually something else
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:40.440]  national review but I find myself going to drudge all the time because as a
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:43.440]  communications professional you can tell what's going to come down the pike if
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:46.720]  there's a siren on drudge report like oh boy better go knock on the oval
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:48.280]  office door and let him know what's gonna happen
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:52.600]  Walker gate yes we're calling it that it's the latest Hillary conspiracy theory
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:56.640]  that set the internet ablaze after the drudge report questioned whether Clinton
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:01.760]  was using a walker in this people magazine cover photo well internet
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:05.960]  pioneer Matt drudge created a firestorm over the weekend tweeting just paid
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:10.720]  the Obamacare penalty for not getting covered I'm calling it a liberty tax but
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:15.040]  a White House representative firing back tweeting flat lie no fee for previous
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:18.360]  years scary how much influence he once had and then the White House shot back
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:21.320]  and said you know made some cheap shot about oh he used to be relevant are you
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:25.040]  kidding me Matt drudge used to be relevant let me give you the numbers in
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:31.840]  one month right and go on the website 800 almost 810 million unique views on
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.600]  the drudge report I guess that a nice Twitter fight between the White House and
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:40.040]  Matt drudge people had suggested I start a mailing list so I collected the
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:45.480]  emails and set up a list called the drudge report one reader turned into five
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:50.640]  then turned into a hundred and faster than you could say I never had sex with
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:55.880]  that woman it was a thousand five thousand a hundred thousand people the
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:49:01.200]  ensuing website practically launched itself last month I had six million
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:07.080]  visitors and I currently have a daily average larger than the weekly newsstand
[01:49:07.080 --> 01:49:11.760]  sales of Time Magazine check out these numbers about 33 million visits in just
[01:49:11.760 --> 01:49:16.440]  the last 24 hours alone almost 900 million in the last month and get this
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:21.320]  over 11 billion in the last year some people love them some people hate them
[01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:26.160]  and the White House may fear him because they can't control him anyone for
[01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:29.560]  any reason can launch a website little to no money internet connection local
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:34.480]  phone the modem let you cover the world the modem let you read what's happening
[01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:39.680]  if there's an earthquake in Alaska seconds after it happens I think that's
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:46.160]  fun and dramatic for free by a medium that was built by taxpayer money so
[01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:53.280]  perfectly realized and again let the future begin any way you look at it
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:57.720]  Matt drudge is now a global icon not just here in the United States but
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:03.900]  worldwide he is an example of independent true media challenging the
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:10.440]  Goliath state-run systems Matt drudge is a visionary and a futurist and I admire
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:15.800]  him because he's a folk hero he's a grassroots person who was able to
[01:50:15.800 --> 01:50:22.240]  basically leverage his instinct for the pulse of the people and change the way
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:27.400]  the world sees news and information and he's also had the courage to not just
[01:50:27.400 --> 01:50:33.040]  carry info wars dot com stories but countless other grassroots media stories
[01:50:33.040 --> 01:50:38.400]  and really change the narrative towards one that is more based on reality and
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:44.360]  empowering the people and liberty Matt drudge is classic Americana and he's a
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:49.240]  great example not just to our generation but future generations to come and when
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:53.320]  the history books are written on the info wars and the media wars of the
[01:50:53.320 --> 01:51:00.120]  20th and 21st century Matt drudge's name will be right there at the center
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:11.040]  now that's powerful broadcast over radio but in the next 30 minutes we'll post
[01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:15.240]  the video up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com and I'm gonna
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:20.640]  tweet it out and even if you don't like Matt drudge you should understand folks
[01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:27.120]  that he promotes the entire political spectrum of thought not just libertarian
[01:51:27.120 --> 01:51:31.840]  or conservative ideas and so many times we wouldn't have beaten gun control
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:36.400]  legislation or other really bad things when the fight is just so close if drudge
[01:51:36.400 --> 01:51:43.760]  wasn't there drudge has helped info wars dot com to a massive degree and you
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:46.680]  know cause the White House to respond to what we're doing and what we're saying
[01:51:46.680 --> 01:51:53.400]  and overall has fought against the police state the surveillance grid the
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:56.960]  cloning back when drudge used to do a Sunday night radio show listen every
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:02.800]  time I could and it was a more you know calm professional version of what I do
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:07.480]  here on air back at the time I've got a little bit more professional over the
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:13.640]  years but the issue is we need to get the people involved in media I'm so
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:16.840]  dedicated to this I've already skipped a break last hour I just skipped this
[01:52:16.840 --> 01:52:20.120]  break that's how we fund the whole operation cost thousands of dollars
[01:52:20.120 --> 01:52:25.240]  every time I do it that's how dedicated I am to this is that I just just can't
[01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:29.640]  stop working I can't stop thinking I can't stop trying to figure out how to
[01:52:29.640 --> 01:52:35.520]  not be a slave and how to expose that we knew the NSA was listening to people
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:41.240]  to their cable boxes 16 17 years ago I'm on record we knew the smart meters were
[01:52:41.240 --> 01:52:45.720]  going in in many areas 10 years ago we knew about the the urban warfare gun
[01:52:45.720 --> 01:52:50.120]  confiscation plan 18 years ago and the fact that we've been exposing it and
[01:52:50.120 --> 01:52:54.720]  you've been exposing it means we've held a lot of it off even though now it's
[01:52:54.720 --> 01:53:00.680]  starting to come to fruition people always say it's one of the simple labels
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:04.080]  to throw at us for people for non-thinking folks and propagandists
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:08.400]  we're targeting non-thinking people oh where's the FEMA camp where's the New
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:12.760]  World Order where's big brother where's the it's happening our government's
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.280]  funding al-Qaeda they're murdering Christians everywhere there's total
[01:53:16.280 --> 01:53:20.080]  surveillance microphones being put up nationwide on street corners and going
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:24.800]  on for about 20 years but now it's ubiquitous it's going in everywhere the
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:28.600]  flesh-eating bacteria the diabetes doubling tripling quadripling the
[01:53:28.600 --> 01:53:34.480]  the cancer rates exploding the the people's language shrinking people
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:39.200]  obsessed with their smartphones it's all happening but there'll be a renaissance
[01:53:39.200 --> 01:53:45.400]  against all of that and you are that renaissance you believing in yourself
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:51.520]  starting a blog starting a blog radio show a vlog starting a video piece on
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:57.200]  YouTube and not infighting like cast Sunstein the Pentagon go out with bots
[01:53:57.200 --> 01:54:01.440]  trying to stir you up with all the racist stuff they put up on both sides but
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:07.000]  but just sticking to issues sticking to what the technocrats are doing we are
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:13.360]  the vast majority and the vast majority do want freedom and private property and
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:18.160]  do want true diversity of media and I agree with Matt Rudge we're going back
[01:54:18.160 --> 01:54:23.240]  to where every major city had up to 10 to 15 newspapers small towns would have
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:28.720]  two or three because that's how everybody got their news before radio and
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:33.720]  television got really big and so you had reporters battling for the scoops
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:39.320]  battling for the latest info battling for the dirt and it made us a much
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:44.800]  freer society and people wanted that morning edition and that lunch edition
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:48.600]  and that evening edition and that late late or that extra extra you know what
[01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:55.360]  extra extra means it's an extra edition the newspaper stands were just packed
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:58.800]  full of just oh my gosh what what happened here what happened there and
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:02.480]  if somebody was wrong they'd get sued and and and there'd be court cases and
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:09.560]  there'd be fights over it and it was exciting it was like the internet 1920s
[01:55:09.560 --> 01:55:16.120]  type newspapers 1900 types of newspapers places like New York City had 20 plus
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:24.480]  daily papers or more Dallas had more than eight papers it was down to two when I

[01:59:51.960 --> 01:59:59.680]  Waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:12.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:19.680]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin
[02:00:19.680 --> 02:00:28.560]  Texas Alex Jones I really appreciate Daniel and Ron holding so long
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:33.800]  apologize the other folks but we did have guests lined up Ron in Colorado a
[02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:39.760]  pilot and flight dispatcher to give his take on that airline being sent through
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:44.720]  that war zone for me that's the big enchilada what do you think Ron well
[02:00:44.720 --> 02:00:49.440]  that was the first question I was asking when it when it happened you know you
[02:00:49.440 --> 02:00:53.520]  cannot dispatch a flight through restricted airspace or a combat zone you
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:01:00.000]  know that'd be the equivalency of dispatching a 740 by TWA 747 over
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:04.360]  hand away I mean you got to be kidding me that was the first thing I said I
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:08.960]  noticed one of your callers earlier said those fresh passports I do remember
[02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:13.280]  seeing that photo and it always puzzled me because normally my passports beat
[02:01:13.280 --> 02:01:18.680]  up and I'm just seeing brand new fresh passports really weird but not only that
[02:01:18.680 --> 02:01:25.400]  the same aircraft type model is missing from the same airline what are the odds
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:34.400]  of that I agree but it doesn't matter that you're a pilot and work as an air
[02:01:34.400 --> 02:01:38.200]  traffic controller or dispatcher the Boston Globe says you're not allowed to
[02:01:38.200 --> 02:01:42.760]  question things like that well what I really want to find out is okay every
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:47.000]  aircraft has multiple serial number stamped all over I had part of my
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:52.120]  power plant license to when I was a lot younger and I know the engine every
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:55.840]  engine part is stamped with the serial number the aircraft so I want to know
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:01:59.120]  the serial numbers of the aircraft is missing and match them to this aircraft
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:04.440]  I just find it totally unbelievable that you've got a plane that disappears in
[02:02:04.440 --> 02:02:09.680]  nowhere which is unbelievable already okay that's that's just I never bought
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:13.080]  that story to begin with and then you have the same model type and aircraft
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:17.640]  to get shot down over here it's utterly with this story is completely not
[02:02:17.640 --> 02:02:23.160]  overly ridiculous and you look at operation I'm sorry go ahead I said
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:29.360]  now we're gonna start declaring a cold war by these thieves and I just I don't
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:32.600]  know what the I'm third-generation military I Alec I just don't even know
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:35.640]  what to think of this country anymore you know my father fought in World War
[02:02:35.640 --> 02:02:40.600]  2 Korea and Vietnam against so-called communism while you've got Harry Reid
[02:02:40.600 --> 02:02:44.600]  cutting land deals with the Chinese you got Smithfield selling there selling all
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:47.640]  our chicken poultry to the time I mean what is going on around here I mean I'm
[02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:50.960]  gonna I'm in a twilight zone move it's a total sell out of this is what tyranny
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:54.920]  looks like and they're just getting started I hear you brother and thanks
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:01.360]  for the call remember Operation Northwoods ABC News CIA would have
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:05.960]  operatives go on the plane go land it have a say it disappeared basically have
[02:03:05.960 --> 02:03:10.600]  another one take off and then get blown up later they even talked about in
[02:03:10.600 --> 02:03:13.400]  another false play how to put dead bodies on board a ship they were gonna do
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:16.520]  that they did that in World War 2 to I'm telling you folks this is really
[02:03:16.520 --> 02:03:21.600]  suspicious and Malaysia is working with the globalist I mean I agree that it
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:24.840]  looks bad I don't I don't know what's going on I just know the official story
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:28.800]  is full of holes that you could drive a Mack truck through Daniel thanks for
[02:03:28.800 --> 02:03:32.160]  calling and holding you work with aviation equipment what's your take on
[02:03:32.160 --> 02:03:39.160]  this you're due and let's have a new first-time caller go ahead well read an
[02:03:39.160 --> 02:03:42.560]  article out of the London's holy telegraph about the death strike was
[02:03:42.560 --> 02:03:47.000]  that was meant to be on both of the plane I thought that seemed pretty
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  unreal but what you're what your caller touched on the last caller you know the
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:57.080]  probability both of these things happening you know I kind of wanted to
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:02.160]  break it down really simple for your for your listeners even if it was a you know
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:08.520]  one percent chance that the first plane went and disappeared and never was to be
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:14.360]  found again you know the second plane disappearing is probably another one
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:18.720]  percent or smaller chance well you know when you multiply one percent by one
[02:04:18.720 --> 02:04:24.360]  percent you get point zero one percent that's a pretty low probability
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:30.240]  yeah it sounds like they've got a deal with Malaysian Airlines to troll over
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:36.040]  war zones because they're now flying over the rebel-held area in Syria that's a
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:42.200]  no-fly area and I mean that's a story out today something's going on here
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:47.480]  something's going on and I guess they say oh look Syria shot down a Malaysian
[02:04:47.480 --> 02:04:51.360]  owner we have to attack them too I mean this is classic war propaganda thank you
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:56.280]  so much Daniel for holding okay Syrian girl will give us her take on this and

[02:08:24.760 --> 02:08:31.160]  Mimi Allah him or Syrian girl is with us for the balance of the hour at the
[02:08:31.160 --> 02:08:36.000]  bottom of the hour I'm gonna open the phones up so you can talk to her she is
[02:08:36.000 --> 02:08:44.240]  in Australia her family are refugees from Syria were anti Assad and for about a
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:49.800]  year and a half now first going on YouTube than this show and then on
[02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:54.840]  Australian television RT you name it Syrian girl has been one of the most
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:09:01.840]  accurate reporters out there and pundits exposing what's happening in Syria now
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:07.440]  Isis has gone into Iraq killing tens of thousands there they estimate 300,000
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:11.120]  dead in the last three and a half almost four years of globalist packed
[02:09:11.120 --> 02:09:17.120]  destabilization civil war operations in Syria and again I don't endorse
[02:09:17.120 --> 02:09:22.480]  Vladimir Putin Russia's got a lot of issues that was under Schultz and
[02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:26.240]  Easton who I admire did endorse him before he died publicly and the US
[02:09:26.240 --> 02:09:31.560]  ambassador went there not believing it and had dinner with him you said he said
[02:09:31.560 --> 02:09:35.640]  a cogent sultan each and broke it all down that compared to the wicked West that
[02:09:35.640 --> 02:09:39.240]  was run by such evil and that actually funded the Bolsheviks to begin with
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:42.560]  Schultz needs to write a book about it that literally I could have written but
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:47.680]  not as good as him about how the West over through Russia put the Bolsheviks
[02:09:47.680 --> 02:09:51.520]  in and that information has been so powerful in Russia that it's deep
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:57.680]  programming the KGB people all of them and it's a nationalism and I guess a
[02:09:57.680 --> 02:10:02.240]  patriarchy you could call it being set up there which I have some problems with
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:06.440]  kind of an El Hefe system but compared to exterminism and the destruction of
[02:10:06.440 --> 02:10:11.840]  Russia it's certainly better than communism the issue is Russia is not
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:16.920]  offensively attacking anybody they're in a proxy war in Syria they're in a proxy
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:23.800]  war in Iraq the government that our government put in Maliki has been
[02:10:23.800 --> 02:10:31.040]  neutral and is basically being overthrown right now by Saudi Arabia and
[02:10:31.040 --> 02:10:36.040]  the ISIS forces and that's all come out now so there's some of the background on
[02:10:36.040 --> 02:10:40.560]  that front but we'll take your calls the phones are wide open now with your
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:47.160]  questions or comments on the geopolitical things in Ukraine and Syria in Iraq and in
[02:10:47.160 --> 02:10:51.480]  other areas of Africa where the ISIS and al Qaeda forces are publicly funded by
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:55.080]  globalist interest and then our military goes and fights them you have to
[02:10:55.080 --> 02:10:58.120]  understand this is full spectrum dominance you want to destabilize the
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:01.680]  country then the military has to march in and deal with them after they've
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:06.160]  taken the nation down later so I'm going to explain they're real al Qaeda real
[02:11:06.160 --> 02:11:11.120]  ISIS and they're not controlled by the West they are like turning a vicious
[02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:16.560]  rabid pit bull is with small children if the pit bulls under your control you
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:22.480]  just release it in to attack and that's what's going on here and the CFR
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:25.680]  writes about it every month they don't even remember the headline two years
[02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:31.840]  ago why we need al Qaeda in Syria and how great they are and then finally Rand
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:35.240]  Paul and Ted Cruz came out and said we're not al Qaeda's air force in Syria
[02:11:35.240 --> 02:11:39.360]  and the military holding up info wars comm signs that's where it started with
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:43.400]  hashtags said I will not fight for al Qaeda in Syria and the chairman of the
[02:11:43.400 --> 02:11:48.680]  joint chiefs went on the Friday night before the strike was set and said you
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:53.240]  have to stand down we can't do this and then it came out the British SAS and
[02:11:53.240 --> 02:11:58.720]  others did train as we told you two years ago al Qaeda forces and ISIS forces
[02:11:58.720 --> 02:12:03.120]  they know you know it's al Qaeda so they just change it to ISIS folks to confuse
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:08.760]  you and now they've had a bunch of the Wahhabist even come out in Saudi Arabia
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:13.760]  and say these people are being run by the West so that's now in major re-odd
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:18.200]  newspapers it's in Israeli papers and then Netanyahu came out a month ago and
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:24.000]  said we need ISIS you're doing a good job because it got exposed that in
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.240]  northern Israel by Lebanon and in bordering Syria that Israeli forces
[02:12:29.240 --> 02:12:35.080]  are coordinating with ISIS and people didn't send me email saying why are you
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:40.120]  anti-Israel man you're mentally ill if you think that I'm gonna shine on to
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:44.760]  backing al Qaeda blowing up churches or blowing up moderate Muslims and putting
[02:12:44.760 --> 02:12:50.440]  burkas on women's heads okay and sexually mutilating people okay I'm not
[02:12:50.440 --> 02:12:55.960]  anti-Israel but our country Israel all of them the decisions have been made to
[02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:00.880]  back al Qaeda worldwide and that's incredibly immoral and what does it say
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:04.480]  about us if we just let them ignore this and let this keep going on our
[02:13:04.480 --> 02:13:08.120]  military's not ignoring it they're freaked out and they should be
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:12.360]  terrorism has been used to end our way of life and bring in tyranny and now
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:16.400]  they say the Tea Party's the main enemy and gun owners and returning veterans
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.760]  and Christians that's on record don't you see it the borders wide open it's all
[02:13:21.760 --> 02:13:29.120]  a fraud we are now the enemy because the globalist are literally occupiers we
[02:13:29.120 --> 02:13:34.040]  get that message out we can stop them so we salute Syrian girl twitter.com
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:40.200]  forward slash partisan girl youtube.com Syrian girl partisan and she joins us
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:44.400]  so Mimi great to have you on with us from Australia thanks for getting up at
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:48.800]  four in the morning or whatever it is what time is it in Australia at the
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:54.240]  moment it's about getting towards 3 a.m. I think and thanks so much for having me
[02:13:54.240 --> 02:13:58.360]  on again it's a great pleasure and an honor to be on it's an honor to have you
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:02.240]  okay well you've heard me for five minutes talking about my view what's
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:07.800]  your take what do you want to start in the world well I would love to go straight
[02:14:07.800 --> 02:14:12.920]  into ISIS if that's okay and then we can get on to the other things because I
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:17.800]  just want to basically support and reiterate a lot of what you've just
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:24.720]  said just recently ISIS has actually pushed out all of the Christians from
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.760]  Mosul in Iraq which they've been there for 2000 and a year of years and they've
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:33.880]  actually been marking their homes just like the Nazis would have marked the
[02:14:33.880 --> 02:14:40.360]  homes of Jewish people in in Germany just before and during World War two so
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:46.560]  they've been of course destroying Iraq's historical artifacts and following on the
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:51.480]  trend of the destruction of Iraq's history since the start of the war in
[02:14:51.480 --> 02:14:57.720]  2003 they've been stoning women and basically their goal is to turn back
[02:14:57.720 --> 02:15:07.640]  time to 1400 years ago so a a British person of Pakistani descent living who
[02:15:07.640 --> 02:15:12.120]  is born in Britain and lived there all his life because he happens to be of
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:19.760]  this specific sect of Wahhabi Islam he believes himself more entitled to Syrian
[02:15:19.760 --> 02:15:24.360]  land than a Syrian Christian or a Syrian Muslim that's been living there for his
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:29.760]  entire life so they believe that anything that is Muslim land that has a
[02:15:29.760 --> 02:15:34.200]  majority of Muslims living in it no matter if those Muslims agree with their
[02:15:34.200 --> 02:15:40.720]  brand of Wahhabism or not Wahhabism is a specific cult that Al Qaeda follow they
[02:15:40.720 --> 02:15:44.000]  believe that land is automatically belongs to them and they're allowed to
[02:15:44.000 --> 02:15:49.200]  just go in there steal people's homes steal people's oil slaughter people not
[02:15:49.200 --> 02:15:54.040]  give anything to society but just create war and destruction and it's basically
[02:15:54.040 --> 02:16:00.480]  like a zombie horde I'd love to talk about who is backing them and basically
[02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:05.440]  how the media plays a role in all this as well sure I mean they're acting
[02:16:05.440 --> 02:16:08.920]  playing dumb like we don't know where ISIS came from well it came from the
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:15.040]  bases they've set up there in eastern Syria the last couple years and they've
[02:16:15.040 --> 02:16:19.080]  been given all these weapons and that's what they're there for but yeah let's
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:23.440]  let's talk about some of these people who are blowing up churches lining up
[02:16:23.440 --> 02:16:28.760]  Christians and non-radical Muslims including Sunnis again Wahhabism for
[02:16:28.760 --> 02:16:33.080]  folks that don't know as a tiny minority of the majority of Islam I guess about
[02:16:33.080 --> 02:16:39.080]  80% that are Sunnis of course you're a Sunni as well and it's just amazing that
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:43.600]  they're now even killing other Sunnis they don't like and eating hearts and
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:47.400]  just and I've talked a lot of military people in family they just say Wahhabist
[02:16:47.400 --> 02:16:52.280]  are like crazed demons they're not Muslims I mean they rape women rape men
[02:16:52.280 --> 02:16:57.120]  kill babies they just are a bunch of psycho supremacists like you said they
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:02.600]  think they're God well exactly they really believe that they are backed by
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:07.040]  God and the media has been sort of helping in this because they're giving
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:11.360]  them an air of invincibility and they're sort of muddying the waters about where
[02:17:11.360 --> 02:17:14.960]  their support is coming from they're making them appear as though nobody's
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:19.520]  supporting them so some brainwashed youths in the West will start to think oh
[02:17:19.520 --> 02:17:24.960]  maybe God is the one who is making ISIS so strong you know perhaps you know they
[02:17:24.960 --> 02:17:29.560]  start to believe in this myth that that's being created and you know ISIS in
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:37.680]  fact formed in Iraq in 2006 around 2006 2007 and one of its leaders actually
[02:17:37.680 --> 02:17:42.080]  admitted when he was captured that the group solely existed on the internet and
[02:17:42.080 --> 02:17:47.240]  yet even while this is happening it was given so much attention by Al Jazeera
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:53.880]  the thing is Al Qaeda was never in Iraq in 2003 even though Bush was claiming it
[02:17:53.880 --> 02:18:00.200]  was it came to Iraq much later as I said in 2006 so it just goes to show you that
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:05.320]  if Syria and Iraq the countries were not destabilized these groups would never
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:11.560]  have been formed have grown as they have you know they used to be largely a myth
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:19.360]  and now they become a reality I think the purpose of ISIS in Iraq was mainly to
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:25.480]  create a division between Shia and Sunnis because in 2004 if you recall many
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:30.480]  people were protesting against the occupation that were both Sunni and Shia
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:36.640]  and the country was sort of united against the occupation and in order to
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:41.960]  divide and conquer them of course the thinkers of the time such as James
[02:18:41.960 --> 02:18:49.800]  Steel, Robert Ford who created the El Salvador option I know I'm forgetting a
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:54.600]  lot of names here they decided to back death squads from both the Shia side and
[02:18:54.600 --> 02:19:00.160]  the Sunni side so on the Shia side of the coin they supported the beta brigades
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:05.560]  which were supported by Iran and created by Iran during the Iran-Iraq war and
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:10.960]  they actually put them into the interior ministry of Iraq and created this
[02:19:10.960 --> 02:19:16.640]  very sectarian government and military and on the other side of that coin they
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:24.280]  created ISIS which is of course sees all Shiites as basically lambs to the slaughter
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:30.200]  just like Israel created Hamas to counter Hezbollah in 1974 or 5 this is
[02:19:30.200 --> 02:19:35.880]  full spectrum dominance for those that understand where you where you create
[02:19:35.880 --> 02:19:39.680]  the two groups to wreck the country the target is the women and children the
[02:19:39.680 --> 02:19:44.000]  target is civilization the target is movie theaters the target is running
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:50.120]  water the target is is is eugenics and that's what this is and that's why
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:54.920]  these are absolutely war crimes by the rand corporation and the Pentagon and
[02:19:54.920 --> 02:19:58.160]  they're doing it to us here domestically we're all under attack to

[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:51.000]  you it's to pass on to friends and family realize that we can defeat this
[02:24:51.000 --> 02:24:55.320]  together just like we stopped the air war that would have toppled the regime
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:59.360]  there to turn it over to al-qaeda to blow up every church and murder every
[02:24:59.360 --> 02:25:03.440]  Muslim that wasn't a Wahhabist you're wearing a suit and tie don't have a
[02:25:03.440 --> 02:25:07.680]  big beard you're dead you haven't attacked anybody and want to work with
[02:25:07.680 --> 02:25:11.360]  people you're dead you run around like psychos that want to kill people all
[02:25:11.360 --> 02:25:15.480]  day go from country to country you're gonna be put in charge I mean this is
[02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:19.160]  this is so evil it's chaos just like they want our borders open just like
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:23.320]  they want to teach kids 2 plus 2 equals 5 and cut our power plants off and ship
[02:25:23.320 --> 02:25:27.520]  our jobs overseas this country is under attack the whole world is by the
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:32.040]  globalist they're attacking everybody they're cutting our troops off of their
[02:25:32.040 --> 02:25:38.560]  VA benefits putting them on death list Syrian girl joins us again with her
[02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:44.840]  inside perspective Mimi continuing here with where you left off how are things
[02:25:44.840 --> 02:25:49.960]  going from your family you talk to you back in Syria in the war I know they've
[02:25:49.960 --> 02:25:53.240]  been forced into a lot of setbacks and militarily if you're losing one
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:56.680]  conflict to boost morale and keep momentum going a lot of times you'll
[02:25:56.680 --> 02:26:00.320]  then try to invade something else I think that's a big part of this move into
[02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:04.080]  Iraq as well Saudi Arabia has been trying to act like they're not involved
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:08.960]  but they're involved on record so what's your intel on that well from what's
[02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:13.360]  left of my family in Syria they're residing in Damascus and they actually
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:17.240]  told me that the situation in Damascus is getting much better the checkpoints
[02:26:17.240 --> 02:26:22.960]  are no longer very close to the city they're moving out into the outskirts
[02:26:22.960 --> 02:26:28.080]  but on the other hand in Aleppo I have a friend in Aleppo and he tells me that in
[02:26:28.080 --> 02:26:33.080]  that city of two million people they've been without running water for two months
[02:26:33.080 --> 02:26:38.680]  because the Al Qaeda rebels actually blew up the the water supply and this
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:44.200]  isn't ISIS this is Jabhat al-Nusra the other Al Qaeda rebels that the moderate
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:48.760]  rebels that they keep telling us about seem to be working alongside and so
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:52.560]  they're just conveniently forgotten about in the media so yeah they've
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:58.000]  actually been without running water they can't take showers they can't flush the
[02:26:58.000 --> 02:27:03.160]  toilet they can't open their make a cup of tea or anything so they've been
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:09.760]  taking it out of of rivers and just dragging them back to their homes and
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:13.440]  you never hear about that from the humanitarians but I just wanted to go
[02:27:13.440 --> 02:27:16.880]  back to Hamas just for a little bit because of what's going on in Gaza and
[02:27:16.880 --> 02:27:22.160]  what you mentioned about its its creation I just wanted to say yes they
[02:27:22.160 --> 02:27:26.680]  were created to weaken other groups which were based on nationalism and
[02:27:26.680 --> 02:27:31.360]  secularism rather than religion but perhaps maybe Hamas just wasn't
[02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:36.560]  sectarian enough because in 2001 the Mossad actually was caught trying to
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:40.960]  start an Al Qaeda cell in Gaza so that's really interesting and it's also
[02:27:40.960 --> 02:27:45.920]  interesting that it was ISIS that claimed to have captured the three
[02:27:45.920 --> 02:27:50.600]  illegal Israeli settlers not Hamas Hamas actually said they had nothing to do
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:55.520]  with it and that was the event that was the precursor to Israel starting to bomb
[02:27:55.520 --> 02:28:02.000]  Gaza so it's interesting how ISIS has been tying in to that plan and one of
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:06.960]  the other plans that ISIS has really been tying into is the Balkanization of
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:11.920]  Iraq and Syria into each country being split into three separate states which
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:17.600]  has been one of the main goals of a lot of these think tanks such as the
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:22.160]  Brookings Institute that suggested this would be really beneficial towards the
[02:28:22.160 --> 02:28:26.760]  U.S. and Israel and of course you know that means the creation of Kurdistan
[02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:33.120]  supporting the Peshmerger there let's be clear at Harvard the Chicago
[02:28:33.120 --> 02:28:36.840]  Business School the Pentagon Rand Corporation all these big think tanks
[02:28:36.840 --> 02:28:41.720]  are bragging about how great this is going I wonder however everybody in
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:47.120]  Israel deals with Netanyahu openly endorsing ISIS a month ago and saying
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:51.480]  you know what's going on in Iraq is good for us good for us I mean how is
[02:28:51.480 --> 02:28:58.080]  joining with evil causing civil war killing innocent people how is that good
[02:28:58.080 --> 02:29:02.560]  for Israel I mean I could see the geopolitical things for now but how is
[02:29:02.560 --> 02:29:08.480]  losing the moral high ground how is doing that good for Israel well they
[02:29:08.480 --> 02:29:12.840]  just want more land I guess it it's like or they just want to continue their
[02:29:12.840 --> 02:29:17.720]  ethnic cleansing of all of the Palestinians that live amongst them so
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:21.840]  that's the that's the agenda I don't think it's good for Jewish people I
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:28.080]  think that it's good for only the state that wants to grow I mean the state has
[02:29:28.080 --> 02:29:31.640]  a mind of its own it doesn't care exactly that's why all these governments act
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:37.160]  just the same just like our state wants a war with Russia but we don't it's the
[02:29:37.160 --> 02:29:41.640]  state and people like George Soros in it that just get power out of chaos and
[02:29:41.640 --> 02:29:47.160]  out of a permanent crisis government COG we'll be back with phone calls with

[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:30.200]  finishing up with where you see all this going and why do you think suddenly
[02:38:30.200 --> 02:38:34.840]  Obama doesn't care if people know that our government runs al-Qaeda how can
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:39.680]  Benjamin yet and yahoo so we got to attack this country because or Gaza this
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:47.840]  area this enclave because ISIS killed three of our teenagers but then be in
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:51.880]  the Jerusalem post saying what ISIS is doing is good for Israel and Iraq and
[02:38:51.880 --> 02:38:58.320]  Iran it's just such a moral bankruptcy publicly and then they and then it's
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:02.320]  a moral high ground if I'm not for al-Qaeda I'm now anti-Israel it's just
[02:39:02.320 --> 02:39:07.880]  it's very bizarre it's because they count on the fact that they can keep people
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:12.320]  asleep and dumb down with all their stupid shows that they put on for them
[02:39:12.320 --> 02:39:19.080]  and basically they muddy the waters you know on one hand they tell you oh they
[02:39:19.080 --> 02:39:23.160]  try to spread rumors like oh Israel's neutral or Israel Israel actually
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:28.440]  supports Assad when in reality they're actually helping the rebels giving them
[02:39:28.440 --> 02:39:33.920]  medical aid and giving them shelter on the border and these are al-Qaeda that
[02:39:33.920 --> 02:39:38.560]  they're sheltering you know it's it's it's it's obvious for people who are
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:43.040]  paying attention but they're counting on the fact that nobody's paying attention
[02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:46.880]  other points you'd like to get out on air before we go to calls and I want to
[02:39:46.880 --> 02:39:55.320]  get your take on Ukraine other points on ISIS I suppose I just I wanted to
[02:39:55.320 --> 02:40:00.920]  really make the point that when Obama said he wanted to give 500 million
[02:40:00.920 --> 02:40:05.920]  dollars to strengthen the moderate rebels what he really was trying to say is
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:10.440]  I want to give 500 million dollars to ISIS because he himself said a week
[02:40:10.440 --> 02:40:15.640]  previously that the idea of a moderate ready rebel force in Syria is a fantasy
[02:40:15.640 --> 02:40:20.560]  and even the head of the moderates Jamal Marouf this is the guy that the US says
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:25.600]  is the beacon of hope said on record to the independent the al-Qaeda is not his
[02:40:25.600 --> 02:40:29.560]  problem and that he's fought alongside them in many battles and this just
[02:40:29.560 --> 02:40:33.480]  happens to be the Jabhat al-Nusra faction so I just wanted to say that while
[02:40:33.480 --> 02:40:37.480]  ISIS is barbaric we shouldn't forget about the barbarism of the other rebel
[02:40:37.480 --> 02:40:41.720]  groups which are sold to us as moderates and again most people in the
[02:40:41.720 --> 02:40:45.800]  government are not evil so all this confusion is designed to confuse the
[02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:50.680]  military the police everybody we're here decompartmentalizing this and we've
[02:40:50.680 --> 02:40:55.360]  shown years beforehand we know what we're talking about right now we are
[02:40:55.360 --> 02:41:02.000]  right about this and we have been for a long time I think what's coming next
[02:41:02.000 --> 02:41:04.360]  what do you think's gonna well what's the next big shoot a drop in the Middle
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:09.720]  East I think that the idea for the Middle East is to keep them on a slow
[02:41:09.720 --> 02:41:13.280]  burn and keep the bloodshed going as long as possible and hopefully get some
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:20.000]  divided states I think that with Ukraine and the world and where everything is
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:26.880]  going I know I'm sorry did I jump ahead to go ahead tell us about Ukraine well
[02:41:26.880 --> 02:41:32.560]  I wanted to say you know at the end of the Cold War one of the deals that went
[02:41:32.560 --> 02:41:37.560]  about before Warsaw was disbanded was that Ukraine would sort of stay a
[02:41:37.560 --> 02:41:46.840]  neutral ground that wouldn't be put into the NATO camp now while Warsaw the
[02:41:46.840 --> 02:41:53.120]  USSR's brand of NATO was disbanded NATO remains alive and well and NATO's
[02:41:53.120 --> 02:41:57.680]  objective was to isolate Russia and I believe that what's happening in Ukraine
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:03.600]  now follows what happened between the the Georgia Russian war only a few years
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:08.640]  ago and what's happening in Syria as well is to continue basically to restart
[02:42:08.640 --> 02:42:12.920]  the Cold War and to continue to surround and isolate Russia and that that's
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:17.080]  heading towards dangerous ground what happened in Maydan was basically a
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:22.000]  colored revolution whether or not you know the government that was overthrown
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:26.280]  was an oligarchy it was democratically elected but whether or not you know the
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:30.840]  the governments in Ukraine were oligarchy which I'm sure they were you know a
[02:42:30.840 --> 02:42:36.480]  lot of what happened was and another oligarch was put into power but in the
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:40.680]  meantime they created so much division and and the problems between the people
[02:42:40.680 --> 02:42:45.880]  and disenfranchised the Russian speakers so it is a direct result of this
[02:42:45.880 --> 02:42:50.040]  colored revolution what we're seeing happen in Ukraine now and it just goes
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:54.240]  to show you that even if the Syrian president had stepped down at the start
[02:42:54.240 --> 02:42:59.720]  of 2011 it wouldn't have prevented a civil war it would have perhaps
[02:42:59.720 --> 02:43:07.760]  accelerated the Balkanization and the division of Syria well that's right and
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:13.200]  again it's the very same proxy war they're starting in Ukraine that they
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:17.480]  started in Syria over the last almost four years and what's wild about this is
[02:43:17.480 --> 02:43:20.680]  when you're just even barely paying attention it's all in slow motion clear
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:26.520]  it's all admitted but in our news it's like bad man Putin shot ordered plane
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:34.440]  shot down he mean we need to hurt him and you Putin mean Putin bad Putin evil
[02:43:34.440 --> 02:43:39.280]  and you know he's the brand new dictator yeah Putin's missile oh he's so
[02:43:39.280 --> 02:43:44.280]  like he was there launching the missile himself when it's hiding in plain view
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:49.120]  why was a commercial airliner of the exact same-making model of the other
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.760]  missing one I mean this gets a little too weird it's basically impossible folks
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:58.640]  in my view statistically to fly through a restricted airspace area and I had
[02:43:58.640 --> 02:44:01.760]  all these air traffic controllers you name it call in and they said yes you're
[02:44:01.760 --> 02:44:07.800]  right just no one is allowed to fly in there it's a huge area and they fly
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:13.160]  right through it when they shot down another plane there the day before so
[02:44:13.160 --> 02:44:17.240]  statistically I think the Russians probably did shoot it down but the issue
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:21.240]  is is that the issue they flew it through there and we got an air traffic
[02:44:21.240 --> 02:44:26.080]  controller on earlier saying this will be the equivalent of in Vietnam flying a
[02:44:26.080 --> 02:44:30.960]  passenger jet over Hanoi over North Vietnam and then freaking out saying
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:35.520]  they shot down a passenger liner well you would ask why did you fly a plane
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.320]  through a war zone whoever ordered it to fly through there is is is who did it
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:49.200]  basically I think it's very very strange that nobody is able to fly over
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:53.520]  Syrian airspace where it was like that for many years where the US advised or
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:58.920]  the civil aviation authority advised airliners not to fly over Syrian airspace
[02:44:58.920 --> 02:45:04.200]  but somehow it was okay to fly over Ukrainian airspace and that's because
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:09.360]  you know the responsibility is not over on their heads so I think that you know
[02:45:09.360 --> 02:45:14.840]  it especially in that area where the responsibility lies you know to just
[02:45:14.840 --> 02:45:21.160]  say it's Putin it's basically just such bias that we've been seeing in the
[02:45:21.160 --> 02:45:25.880]  media right now even I laugh because I also recall cold during the winter
[02:45:25.880 --> 02:45:30.880]  Olympics the media against the winter Olympics was so strong because it was
[02:45:30.880 --> 02:45:36.400]  held in Russia and I believe there was some hashtag like Putin fail or Russia
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:40.520]  fail or something along those lines just the beat up and it's just like the
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:46.080]  return of the Cold War I think but this time we act more like the old Soviets
[02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:49.680]  than Russia does it's really freaking the military out right now let's go to
[02:45:49.680 --> 02:45:55.920]  some phone calls we're gonna go to is it hubu hubu always pronounces name wrong
[02:45:55.920 --> 02:46:00.480]  he's called before and then we've got general George Mike David and others and
[02:46:00.480 --> 02:46:06.360]  David's calling in Spain so we'll go to him first after we talk to hubu thank
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:13.240]  you for coming on sir thank you very much indeed and as usual you've been
[02:46:13.240 --> 02:46:19.640]  spot-on with the Ukrainian matter but what is really the good thing that you
[02:46:19.640 --> 02:46:25.080]  do to humanity is that you've got a worldwide reach a global reach and you
[02:46:25.080 --> 02:46:30.440]  are doing the rebuttal in real time which means then it's not gonna something's
[02:46:30.440 --> 02:46:34.880]  not gonna happen and then one month later we discovered you are hitting him
[02:46:34.880 --> 02:46:41.760]  right in the nose so good for you and bless you the last time I I called when
[02:46:41.760 --> 02:46:46.000]  Syrian girl was on I mentioned and I'm not trying to toot my own horn that it
[02:46:46.000 --> 02:46:53.200]  would help the Syrian authority to have Iranian and Hezbollah and they did enter
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:57.960]  the fray and they did turn it on turn it around here's my question to Syrian
[02:46:57.960 --> 02:47:04.840]  girl right now it seems like ISIS has got a lot of booty meaning they've got
[02:47:04.840 --> 02:47:09.680]  almost by some estimates two billion dollars and they've got advanced armaments
[02:47:09.680 --> 02:47:15.960]  if they are pushed out of Iraq is this going to create almost a monstrous
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:20.560]  problem for Syria because oh no that's the plan they're letting them reckon
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:25.040]  order in Iraq and then get more weapons and then go back into Syria this is
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:29.760]  clearly a regrouping either way if they can't take Iraq that's okay because they
[02:47:29.760 --> 02:47:34.400]  can then regroup and smash back into Syria Syrian girl your take on Habu's
[02:47:34.400 --> 02:47:42.000]  great question that's a really really interesting a point would you know a
[02:47:42.000 --> 02:47:46.840]  running away from Iraq and into Syria it could also create problems for Syria but
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:52.280]  at the same time I think that ISIS is controlling oil fields in Iraq and in
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:56.800]  Syria so it's sort of they're feeding each other ISIS in Iraq is propping up
[02:47:56.800 --> 02:48:00.880]  ISIS in Syria and vice versa so if we can get rid of them in Iraq maybe
[02:48:00.880 --> 02:48:05.960]  it actually would be beneficial for Syria and vice versa I think that it's
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:10.200]  important for Iraq and Syria to coordinate attacks against ISIS together
[02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:15.600]  and indeed they are sitting on a lot of booty they have taken a lot of oil fields
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:20.200]  but I think in order for them to have access to all of those oil fields and
[02:48:20.200 --> 02:48:23.920]  all of those weaponry and to achieve these military gains they would have had
[02:48:23.920 --> 02:48:29.120]  to have had a strong backer and a lot of money coming in from a state for that
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:33.800]  for them to achieve this all right sir good to hear from you thank you let's
[02:48:33.800 --> 02:48:42.200]  talk to David in Spain I'll go ahead hi Alex Syrian girl hi my name is David
[02:48:42.200 --> 02:48:48.080]  I'm calling Spain from Europe I was just listening to the radio show I was
[02:48:48.080 --> 02:48:58.200]  listing a series of countries Iraq Libya Syria Russia China even ISIS and what I
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:04.560]  understand is that predominantly Iraq was was was Sudan was a friend of the
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:09.200]  the West was funded and put in power by the West Gaddafi was the same I
[02:49:09.200 --> 02:49:14.160]  understand that and this is a question for you Syria girl but I understand that
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:22.360]  sad had links to the West and was at one point a great friend of the West we
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:26.720]  know because you've been speaking about it earlier Alex that back in the 20th
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:33.120]  century the West got involved with the Russian situation via the Rothschilds at
[02:49:33.120 --> 02:49:40.200]  some point we know that Kissinger has been doing deals with with China and
[02:49:40.200 --> 02:49:44.120]  it's incredible and I disagree with you though Alex because you say we're
[02:49:44.120 --> 02:49:50.440]  heading off to war I don't think we are not yet because the Russians and the
[02:49:50.440 --> 02:49:56.360]  Chinese aren't powerful enough to have a good old bash at it right and they need
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:50:03.400]  to have better weapons better military better naval and and it's my belief that
[02:50:03.400 --> 02:50:09.120]  it's the the West was selling them all that equipment and training etc just as
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:15.400]  they do with ISIS and just as we know well when I say we're marching off the
[02:50:15.400 --> 02:50:20.240]  war just to be clear there's already a bunch of wars breaking out in Africa
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:26.240]  in Syria all over the Middle East in Ukraine and we're just here you're in
[02:50:26.240 --> 02:50:31.080]  Spain we've had riots in the streets off and on look what's happening there so I
[02:50:31.080 --> 02:50:34.600]  think we're both right but when I say nuclear war I'm saying that card is in
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:39.160]  the deck and it could happen if we don't worry about it and talk about it and
[02:50:39.160 --> 02:50:42.480]  think about it but but I tell you what I'm gonna come back and get Syria girls
[02:50:42.480 --> 02:50:47.560]  take on that but what do you say to what I just said my point is this Alex is
[02:50:47.560 --> 02:50:52.360]  the West was selling them the equipment and that they're not gonna be ready for
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:57.920]  another two three years now I'm in the Joel Scouse and no no I agree with you

[02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:40.040]  featured video on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube as well so that's
[02:54:40.040 --> 02:54:46.560]  happening right now let's go back to Syrian girl David I got to jump on to
[02:54:46.560 --> 02:54:51.600]  other people but Syrian girl you want to comment on what he just said I just
[02:54:51.600 --> 02:54:55.720]  wanted to correct some of the comments such as Russia and China are buying
[02:54:55.720 --> 02:55:00.240]  weapons from the US I don't believe that that's true I think China is still
[02:55:00.240 --> 02:55:04.960]  buying from Russia I think the Russians might be buying microchips though from a
[02:55:04.960 --> 02:55:09.560]  French company called fails because the US is still the best at microchips but
[02:55:09.560 --> 02:55:14.360]  I also wanted to correct about Assad being a friend of the West but Charles
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:20.160]  Assad was actually this current president was being sort of they tried to
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:24.240]  should the West tried to seduce him in 2017. They set up Gaddafi too he invested all their
[02:55:24.240 --> 02:55:28.880]  money worked with him let all their ops in they set him up and the same thing
[02:55:28.880 --> 02:55:32.660]  with Assad he was trying to work with them while they got their people in
[02:55:32.660 --> 02:55:37.120]  place. But Assad wouldn't play the same bowl game I mean Gaddafi decided to
[02:55:37.120 --> 02:55:42.640]  disarm himself of chemical weapons but Assad in 2004 they asked him to disarm his
[02:55:42.640 --> 02:55:46.640]  chemical weapons in exchange for peace he said you know what all this arm when
[02:55:46.640 --> 02:55:51.200]  the entire Middle East disarms of WMDs that was proposed to the United Nations
[02:55:51.200 --> 02:55:56.640]  of course the US vetoed the proposal and we ended up. You got to love how the
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:01.520]  this moral high ground where the West has all these weapons that nobody else can
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:05.080]  have weapons even if they never used them it's like 9-11 happens and we
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:11.440]  blame Saddam. It's just I mean why not attack Australia or the North Pole I
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:17.640]  mean Iraq had nothing to do with 9-11. Absolutely it's all part of the agenda
[02:56:17.640 --> 02:56:22.680]  to just this arm them of these weapons and I wanted to agree with you though
[02:56:22.680 --> 02:56:29.160]  that we are already in a war and we are already heading towards a threat of war
[02:56:29.160 --> 02:56:33.200]  and it's just it's like sticking your head in the sand if you don't examine
[02:56:33.200 --> 02:56:39.440]  the possibility of there being a more a war let's say where the West is involved
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.160]  sure because that's really what it means. Look look they're not building giant
[02:56:43.160 --> 02:56:46.440]  bunkers for the elite everywhere and the elite aren't leaving Israel and other
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.600]  places for no reason I mean this is a big deal but but but I agree with what
[02:56:50.600 --> 02:56:53.680]  Davidson is gonna get worse down the road I think things will just continue
[02:56:53.680 --> 02:56:57.640]  to deteriorate as long as these psychopaths are running things and again
[02:56:57.640 --> 02:57:00.040]  they hate us here in America folks the globalists hate us more than they hate
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:04.760]  the Syrians. They hate anybody that's sovereign anybody that's got guns. Let's
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:09.160]  talk to George in Connecticut thanks for holding her on the air. Hi Alex I just
[02:57:09.160 --> 02:57:14.640]  have one question from Syrian girl and a battle plan after I finished with her.
[02:57:14.640 --> 02:57:19.720]  I want to question I had stayed with some of the very high officials the
[02:57:19.720 --> 02:57:24.600]  intelligence at their house and they had lots of connections with the
[02:57:24.600 --> 02:57:29.000]  airlines being your in Australia and I'm sure you're a little bit familiar with
[02:57:29.000 --> 02:57:33.200]  the politics of Malaysia businesses north of you where your residence is now
[02:57:33.200 --> 02:57:37.200]  do you think that either they were duped or they were blackmailed or there might
[02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:43.880]  be some sort of connection there I'm just curious. Do you mean the airline maybe
[02:57:43.880 --> 02:57:48.360]  somebody wanted to make sure that the airline would go bust that was one thing
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:52.600]  that sort of occurred to me. I mean here's another deal they just flew
[02:57:52.600 --> 02:57:56.960]  through Syrian airspace the day after the shootdown where you're not supposed
[02:57:56.960 --> 02:58:02.440]  to fly I mean they're trying to get those planes shot down. Seems like it's just
[02:58:02.440 --> 02:58:06.000]  bizarre that it just happened to be a Malaysian airline you know twice it's
[02:58:06.000 --> 02:58:11.520]  just it's beyond the coincidence but as to the reason why I can't at this point
[02:58:11.520 --> 02:58:16.760]  make a guess because I it wouldn't be accurate. Yeah Collar what was your battle
[02:58:16.760 --> 02:58:21.040]  plan point. The battle plan point I think we should do something that Amnesty
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:24.800]  International always does they send the letters out to various officials trying
[02:58:24.800 --> 02:58:28.360]  to either release people or whatever in this stead I think we should do the
[02:58:28.360 --> 02:58:33.800]  reverse we should send postcards only postcards no world war three no
[02:58:33.800 --> 02:58:38.600]  Lusitania to to George Soros. Hey I tell you what stay there we're gonna do some
[02:58:38.600 --> 02:58:43.200]  overdrive we get final comment George then we'll go to Mike in general I don't
[02:58:43.200 --> 02:58:46.880]  know if I get to Michigan Patriot we're gonna try but that's a great idea let
[02:58:46.880 --> 02:59:16.560]  Soros know we know it's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and
[02:59:16.560 --> 02:59:20.960]  women everywhere and that's what prison planet TV is designed to do you watch
[02:59:20.960 --> 02:59:26.440]  the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using chemical weapons
[02:59:26.440 --> 02:59:31.360]  against the so-called rebels what we see now is a war against reality it's a war
[02:59:31.360 --> 02:59:35.840]  against the truth it's more vital than ever that supporters of freedom become

[03:00:13.920 --> 03:00:22.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas. Let's go
[03:00:22.640 --> 03:00:25.520]  back to George what was the finish up of your point what do we put on these
[03:00:25.520 --> 03:00:30.520]  postcards no World War three and send them to Soros? Yes no World War three no
[03:00:30.520 --> 03:00:36.960]  Lusitania two sent it to his is the weekend getaway at Southampton it's
[03:00:36.960 --> 03:00:46.000]  550 Old Town Road Southampton 11968 or his home address it's in Katona New
[03:00:46.000 --> 03:00:56.720]  York 136 Katito C-A-N-T-I-T-O-E Street just that postcards from all over the
[03:00:56.720 --> 03:01:00.680]  world to show the whole world is fed up with this picture postcard so he knows
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:04.240]  it's from all over the world I think it'll have a real impact. Well I agree
[03:01:04.240 --> 03:01:07.240]  with you and it's funny I actually know his address because it's been in the
[03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:12.120]  news before that big mansion on that farm he's got and then right in the
[03:01:12.120 --> 03:01:15.800]  middle of most expensive real estate in that area and then he's got that place
[03:01:15.800 --> 03:01:20.200]  in New York and this guy's trying to this guy's a Nazi collaborator and so I
[03:01:20.200 --> 03:01:23.680]  don't want any harm to come to him before he gets a trial but why doesn't he
[03:01:23.680 --> 03:01:27.640]  get scooped up by these Nazi hunters like you know guys they can't even prove
[03:01:27.640 --> 03:01:32.760]  it's just I'm so sick of George Soros I just want to throw up all right
[03:01:32.760 --> 03:01:39.560]  Sherri and girl what do you think of that idea? I support the idea but it's
[03:01:39.560 --> 03:01:45.360]  got to be also in as well trying to wake up people because I think that what
[03:01:45.360 --> 03:01:50.400]  Amnesty International does and all of those controlled humanitarian NGOs is
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:55.960]  that it tries to make people active and in the meanwhile brainwash them about
[03:01:55.960 --> 03:02:00.640]  these ideas. Yeah only be active only be active on their fake causes to attack
[03:02:00.640 --> 03:02:04.840]  things it's well on Amnesty's infiltrated and taken over. His point was take their
[03:02:04.840 --> 03:02:09.040]  tactic. Yeah yeah his point was just take the tactic and we've got to move
[03:02:09.040 --> 03:02:14.440]  quick now Mike in Pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead. Oh yeah. Hi Sherri and girl.
[03:02:14.440 --> 03:02:20.280]  Quick question for you. Turn it off the politics part of this. I'm here in the
[03:02:20.280 --> 03:02:24.120]  world over there I've always wanted this being American always living in America
[03:02:24.120 --> 03:02:30.040]  not traveling outside of America much. What do people think of Americans in
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:34.000]  general? That's a great question. Got a jump but that's an excellent question.
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:39.560]  What do people think of the average American? Well in Australia or in the
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:45.800]  Middle East? Both. Well what I specifically think about Americans just
[03:02:45.800 --> 03:02:50.480]  putting it out there is I believe they're they're all most the vast majority
[03:02:50.480 --> 03:02:55.240]  of them actually want to do good and unfortunately a lot of them have been
[03:02:55.240 --> 03:03:00.440]  brainwashed and controlled but they're very I find they're very very easy to
[03:03:00.440 --> 03:03:06.680]  wake up in fact and very open-minded. But in Australia I suppose there is this
[03:03:06.680 --> 03:03:12.040]  perception that the US is an ignorant place they don't really know what's
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:18.000]  going on and basically they're they want to create these wars and they don't
[03:03:18.000 --> 03:03:21.400]  know geography. Well sounds like they know what they're talking about in
[03:03:21.400 --> 03:03:26.240]  Australia. I love my country but I mean we do statistically have the most
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:30.160]  uninformed morons on the planet and I'm just saying that's we can turn it around.
[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:34.360]  Only the military and the police seem to be alike that's because they kind of
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:37.120]  live in the real world. I'm not even we're in a lot of trouble folks that's all I
[03:03:37.120 --> 03:03:42.080]  can say. General in Texas last caller sorry everybody else quick question or
[03:03:42.080 --> 03:03:48.240]  comment for meaning. Both I have the answer we are about to take victory right now I can't believe no more.
[03:03:48.240 --> 03:03:52.600]  All right real quick Alex it's gonna be I'm trying to get the time in two minutes but
[03:03:52.600 --> 03:03:55.880]  if possible we can speak out. No we got about a minute go go we gotta go we gotta go.
[03:03:55.880 --> 03:03:59.640]  On the inside we have the feeling of anxiety, butterflies, insomnia, nervous,
[03:03:59.640 --> 03:04:03.960]  depression. We all have to get rid of it now. This is faith and this is love. Now
[03:04:03.960 --> 03:04:06.920]  the reason why I say this is love this is the piece that will bring us all
[03:04:06.920 --> 03:04:10.840]  together that energized the info war that to get us from thinking of game
[03:04:10.840 --> 03:04:15.120]  plans like the guy just had to execute in game plan and it's one last piece I
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:18.800]  gotta leave out there for everybody to let go to YouTube and check out Day of
[03:04:18.800 --> 03:04:25.960]  Glory 7773 D-A-Y-G-L-O-R-Y 7773 gonna be seven videos on there the main video
