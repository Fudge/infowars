[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:31.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  This is going to be an extremely informative radio transmission. Thank you for joining us.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  This is the day in the United States when the private central banks rob the dwindling
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  middle class and transfer that money into their war chest to fund their global domination.
[00:51.000 --> 00:57.000]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who two weeks ago quit his column and says he's riding off in the sunset
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  has agreed to do a few more interviews before he says Sayonara at least for the time being
[01:03.000 --> 01:09.000]  he will be joining us in T-minus one hour to talk about a host of economic issues.
[01:09.000 --> 01:14.000]  Lord Christopher Moncton in the United States set to be one of the keynote speakers in D.C.
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  at one of the largest of many Tea Party rallies in the District of Criminals.
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.000]  He'll be joining us for a full hour before he leaves to go address the Tea Party.
[01:24.000 --> 01:30.000]  Lord Christopher Moncton joining us incredible new developments.
[01:30.000 --> 01:36.000]  There's been more than 50 climate gates in the last four months since November.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  Four and a half months. More than 50. There have been five or six more this week.
[01:45.000 --> 01:49.000]  And he's also going to talk about government-run healthcare in England and how it dovetails
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  what's happening here in the United States. Here's the Financial Times of London.
[01:53.000 --> 01:58.000]  Global warming graph attacked by study. There have been many Monctons the first to expose the hockey stick
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  as a fraud. More evidence is coming out of how they've lied about the glaciers
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  and how they're actually rapidly expanding.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  And we have several other mainstream news articles of major studies showing it is the sun
[02:13.000 --> 02:18.000]  as the main climate driver. Secondarily, it is the moon.
[02:18.000 --> 02:27.000]  Old-timers throughout all societies knew that the moon was a major driver of weather.
[02:27.000 --> 02:39.000]  Fisherman knew 5,000 years ago that the anchovies swim into the shallow water
[02:39.000 --> 02:43.000]  at certain times of year when there is a full moon.
[02:43.000 --> 02:48.000]  For thousands of years, they know that crime goes way up at night during a full moon.
[02:48.000 --> 02:53.000]  Why is that? I'm already digressing here. I have a lot of news to cover.
[02:53.000 --> 03:01.000]  Because the moon creates giant tidal forces on the oceans and on animal and plant life,
[03:01.000 --> 03:09.000]  changing the chemical makeup of the brain with massive magnetic pull and force.
[03:09.000 --> 03:16.000]  We are timed to the moon. We are literally living, breathing creatures designed and built
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  and growing on this planet. We are part of the cosmos.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  And of course, all the science now shows that the old-timers were right.
[03:26.000 --> 03:33.000]  It is the sun and moon. That's just common sense that drive climate and so much more
[03:33.000 --> 03:35.000]  on this planet. So another big study on that front.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  Also, cows absolved of global warming with nitrous oxide.
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.000]  They've done tests adding huge flatulence bags to cows to engage in these complex studies
[03:47.000 --> 03:53.000]  and test and found that obviously the methane and other things they're releasing
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  are not hurting the earth. What do you think creates our atmosphere?
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  Sunlight, water, carbon dioxide and oxygen in the carbon cycle.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  Everything we exhale, everything we do is part of the cycle.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  There's always been bovine creatures, whether it's the buffalo of North America
[04:12.000 --> 04:16.000]  or the oxen of Europe or the buffalo of Africa or Asia,
[04:16.000 --> 04:24.000]  the water buffalo running around eating plant matter with their three stomachs
[04:24.000 --> 04:29.000]  and passing gas. Passing gas is not evil.
[04:29.000 --> 04:33.000]  Paying a tax to Al Gore will not save you.
[04:33.000 --> 04:37.000]  I noticed some of you that's a conspiracy theory. You think that flatulence is new.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  It just started last month. But no.
[04:40.000 --> 04:47.000]  The moon and the sun are what's controlling much of the planet and flatulence is normal
[04:47.000 --> 04:51.000]  and part of the atmosphere, part of the cycle.
[04:51.000 --> 04:55.000]  Alright, we'll get a little more serious here when we get back and plunge into all the news.
[04:55.000 --> 05:00.000]  We've got a very full plate and the provocateurs are out in force. Stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000]  What's your home worth? How can you compare local real estate agents

[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[06:10.000 --> 06:12.000]  It really says that the state is God.
[06:12.000 --> 06:18.000]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[06:18.000 --> 06:25.000]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  At least state 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[06:35.000 --> 06:39.000]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[06:45.000 --> 06:49.000]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[06:49.000 --> 06:52.000]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.
[06:52.000 --> 07:00.000]  Secure your copy today at infowars.com or see it online in the highest quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[07:00.000 --> 07:08.000]  Say goodbye to Claude Gutterton, the dangerous job of dangling from a ladder to clean him and say hello to the gutter brush.
[07:08.000 --> 07:12.000]  I recommend this effective, affordable do-it-yourself solution because it works.
[07:12.000 --> 07:23.000]  Imagine a giant cylinder shaped brush that fills your gutter providing continuous 360 degree protection by blocking leaves and debris while allowing water to flow right through.
[07:23.000 --> 07:28.000]  Installation is as simple as sledding the gutter brush section into your existing gutter.
[07:28.000 --> 07:33.000]  It works with any roof or gutter type and doesn't require any tool for insulation.
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  Don't make another bad investment by spending thousands of dollars to keep your gutters flowing.
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  In most cases, just the three to four hundred dollars will protect your entire home and you can do it yourself.
[07:44.000 --> 07:52.000]  Trust me, this is a great product. Just visit gutterbrush.com today or call 888-397-94333.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  That's gutterbrush.com 888-397-94333.
[07:58.000 --> 08:13.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:13.000 --> 08:24.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:24.000 --> 08:29.000]  We're live. It's April 15, 2010. I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours under Paul Craig Roberts who joins us on Federal Reserve right today.
[08:36.000 --> 08:43.000]  And then Lord Christopher Monckton from D.C. just a few hours before he's one of the key speakers at the main Tea Party event.
[08:43.000 --> 08:53.000]  We're going to break down all the attacks on free speech going on by the federal government and by city and state governments and county governments nationwide.
[08:53.000 --> 09:02.000]  The government-funded provocateurs trying to set up the Tea Parties as violent or racist are in high gear right now.
[09:02.000 --> 09:09.000]  The system is desperate to big developments on that front as well.
[09:09.000 --> 09:16.000]  And in the last hour, we'll be live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the second, third and fourth hour, so three hours today live at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[09:16.000 --> 09:27.000]  We have something very special for you and believe me, this is destined to be one of the most viral videos we have ever released.
[09:27.000 --> 09:31.000]  I will just leave it at that. We're going to premiere it.
[09:31.000 --> 09:43.000]  This happened last night here on the air in the last hour and have a larger discussion about the video and audio for radio listeners after we play it.
[09:43.000 --> 09:50.000]  We are also premiering 18 Months in the Making Invisible Empire, a new world order defined.
[09:50.000 --> 09:59.000]  What is a new world order? What makes it tick? What is its crimes, its operational procedures, its game plan, its end game?
[09:59.000 --> 10:11.000]  18 Months in the Making with Jason Bermas, myself, Aaron Dykes, Rob Jacobson, Mike McWhorter, Mr. Whiteside, and many others that made this film possible.
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  It is in the same caliber as an Obama deception or a fall of the Republic.
[10:16.000 --> 10:22.000]  And that will be premiering at 3 p.m. Central Standard Time for PrisonPlanet.tv members.
[10:22.000 --> 10:32.000]  If you are not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, for 15 since a day, you get the equivalent of six memberships.
[10:32.000 --> 10:43.000]  You buy one membership for yourself and we allow with the same passcode and username for six people to be logged in under that name.
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  And we would give it to everybody. The whole thing would be free and we could afford it, but it is your membership that funds it.
[10:48.000 --> 10:54.000]  But the main goal is getting the info out. All my films in super high quality, many other films I produced.
[10:54.000 --> 11:04.000]  My book, Paul Watson's book, the live TV slash radio show, higher quality podcast, higher quality 64 kilobit audio stream with the video, everything at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[11:04.000 --> 11:15.000]  Now six years, we launched it in early April 2004, six years of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[11:15.000 --> 11:23.000]  And in the month of April celebrating that, six years of PrisonPlanet.tv, we're not just premiering one film for members in the month.
[11:23.000 --> 11:30.000]  Next Wednesday, the 21st of April, we premiere Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[11:30.000 --> 11:38.000]  All the rumors are put to bed. The facts are presented. How the COG continuity of government, shadow government system works.
[11:38.000 --> 11:52.000]  The executive orders, the Patriot Act, the John Warren Defense Authorization Act, the Federal Governors Commission, the torture, the false flag terror, the underwear bombing, a hardened Montana fiasco,
[11:52.000 --> 11:57.000]  a two hour, 20 plus minute film with 30 plus minutes of extras.
[11:57.000 --> 12:04.000]  Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, premieres next Wednesday at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  And we now have been shipping the last two days. Many of you are getting them today and tomorrow.
[12:09.000 --> 12:20.000]  And we're going to have all the pre-orders shipped out by tomorrow for everybody that pre-ordered up until today of Invisible Empire, a new order to find.
[12:20.000 --> 12:29.000]  You get the highest quality DVD in the hardcover case. Great to give to friends and family because they'll actually watch it because it looks, you know, has an exciting cover.
[12:29.000 --> 12:34.000]  The information is even more powerful, but we found if you just give somebody a disc with the name on it, they might watch it.
[12:34.000 --> 12:43.000]  But if you give them a high quality DVD with a beautiful color cover with great illustration on the front with a big pyramid and a rising, rising moon above it.
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  And then with all the details on the back, you could unlock someone's mind. This is designed to do just that.
[12:50.000 --> 12:59.000]  So again, order the high quality DVDs, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA and Invisible Empire today at infowars.com.
[12:59.000 --> 13:11.000]  On tax day, we always like to really attack the system, really redouble our efforts to bring down this corrupt new world order and replace it with our constitutional republic
[13:11.000 --> 13:23.000]  and use that model worldwide of free republics working together for advancing humankind and reaching towards the stars and honoring liberty and freedom and decency and innocence.
[13:23.000 --> 13:33.000]  That is our goal. That is our game plan. And we are having massive effect worldwide because of you, the listeners.
[13:33.000 --> 13:48.000]  And because of our tireless efforts here just pounding away at the enemy day after day, week after week, year after year, decade after decade, ramming the enemy, bashing into them, crashing through the lies and disinformation at point blank range.
[13:48.000 --> 14:02.000]  Fearlessly going into the enemy territory, confronting them on every front, exposing their lies, discrediting their crime and their fraud, revealing them for who they are.
[14:02.000 --> 14:09.000]  So we've got a special video, special event in the last hour today.
[14:09.000 --> 14:19.000]  We're premiering a film at three. We've got Lord Monkton and of course Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us today and in something else in the fourth hour, something else.
[14:19.000 --> 14:28.000]  This will be our second year tradition with this. So it is going to be a jam packed broadcast today.
[14:28.000 --> 14:36.000]  I also want to go ahead and open the phones up in this first hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[14:36.000 --> 14:50.000]  1-800-259-9231 on Obama's nuclear blackmail, which even mainstream news is saying is hype and fair mongering just as Bush was caught doing it.
[14:50.000 --> 15:08.000]  You're welcome to discuss all the extra evidence coming out, proving systematic, system-wide, systemic fraud by the climate cult that want to take over our society, the eugenicist, all the provocaturing going on against tea parties nationwide.
[15:08.000 --> 15:24.000]  Welcome to call in with any provocaturing that you have been witnessing. 1-800-259-9231. 1-800-259-9231.
[15:24.000 --> 15:33.000]  Let me get into the latest news on the First Amendment and provocateur actions.
[15:33.000 --> 15:43.000]  This is a story out of the local newspaper in Youngstown, Ohio. And notice how they just dryly report this on the Valley Newspapers website.
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  Protest March to replace gun law rally in Campbell.
[15:51.000 --> 15:58.000]  Now, they tell you that you've got to get a permit to march. That's not true under the First Amendment and it's been found in state and federal courts over and over again.
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.000]  That's the case, but usually people don't sue to prove it. New York has lost a bunch of lawsuits.
[16:03.000 --> 16:11.000]  This started in the last 100 years or so, though, for the St. Patrick's Day Parade or later the Macy's Parade in the last 50 years.
[16:11.000 --> 16:23.000]  If they want to block giant roads through the middle of Manhattan or Chicago or Houston, Texas or Los Angeles or Detroit.
[16:23.000 --> 16:30.000]  And if you want to have a big parade with floats and everything else and shut down five or six major roads on the round, absolutely.
[16:30.000 --> 16:38.000]  You've got to get sponsors. The courts have found you've got to pay for it. You've got to have a plan. You've got to go to the city.
[16:38.000 --> 16:46.000]  That's different. That's a parade generally pushed by businesses as an advertisement promotion.
[16:46.000 --> 16:55.000]  But if you want to march down the sidewalk with 10,000 people or if you want to go march to the steps of a capital or you want to march to the steps of the police station or the city hall,
[16:55.000 --> 17:08.000]  you do not need a permit. And it's despicable that I keep seeing patriot groups and libertarian groups and others showing up at city halls and police stations and getting permits.
[17:08.000 --> 17:17.000]  You create the false precedent and then the cops, just like the public, get brainwashed at anybody else.
[17:17.000 --> 17:23.000]  I can't tell you how many times I've been in D.C., New York, Austin, Texas, and had cops walk up and say,
[17:23.000 --> 17:28.000]  you can't be out here with 100 people outside this hotel Rick Perry's in with a bullhorn. I'm going to arrest you.
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.000]  And I said, officer, I respectfully remind you of the First Amendment. We're not blocking any roads or traffic.
[17:33.000 --> 17:43.000]  And we're here. And this is my First Amendment. And I will remind you the city of Austin and the state police in Austin have lost scores of lawsuits over this.
[17:43.000 --> 17:50.000]  This has been decided. Now, I suggest, Sergeant, you get your commander before you get a serious civil rights lawsuit.
[17:50.000 --> 17:56.000]  They came back. They said, there's the riot police. We're going to arrest you. And I said, okay, you go ahead.
[17:56.000 --> 18:04.000]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride. I will sue you personally. And they backed off.
[18:04.000 --> 18:13.000]  And that's all on video. On YouTube, everywhere else. And with Jones protests, Rick Perry will bring it up for him.
[18:13.000 --> 18:19.000]  And I don't do that because I want to confront the police. I do that because I must defend the First Amendment.
[18:19.000 --> 18:28.000]  And you read this article. It says a rally that was planned to protest a ban on gun sales within city limits is turning into a quick protest march.
[18:28.000 --> 18:33.000]  And its organizer is backing out of promoting it.
[18:33.000 --> 18:43.000]  The Youngstown State University branch of the Young Americans for Liberty had planned a rally at the city building at Tinney Avenue on Saturday afternoon coming up this weekend.
[18:43.000 --> 18:54.000]  But Varg Freeborn of YSU Chapter President said Tuesday that the city police chief has ordered the group to pay $2,000 for four to six police officers to work at the rally.
[18:54.000 --> 19:02.000]  That's what we pay taxes for cops. If you think it's so dangerous, people are having rallies and you're shutting down the Second Amendment and shutting down commerce in the city.
[19:02.000 --> 19:10.000]  And the people want to come out to the city hall and protest it. The city's own cops can't tell students, you've got to pay me $2,000.
[19:10.000 --> 19:19.000]  Next it'll be $10,000. Then it'll be $100,000. This has been found to be unconstitutional and if you force it, it's racketeering.
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  Freeborn said the group was withdrawing its request for a permit to have the rally because it doesn't have the money.
[19:24.000 --> 19:32.000]  Freeborn told the newspaper that it appears the group is being made to pay for exercising its right to free speech.
[19:32.000 --> 19:40.000]  We have a right to peacefully assemble, he said. Freeborn said they were told last week by sending officials that there would be no fees or permits associated with the rally.
[19:40.000 --> 19:47.000]  But Tuesday they were told about having to pay $2,000. And he says, we promoted it, we got ready for it, they did this the last minute.
[19:47.000 --> 19:57.000]  Look, they're going to go ahead and have their rally and who knows what these thugs will do. Ohio is movie tyranny.

[21:23.000 --> 21:26.000]  The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.

[21:34.000 --> 21:39.000]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.

[22:04.000 --> 22:06.000]  Slide into a recession or at worst, depression.
[22:06.000 --> 22:09.000]  Hi, Ted Anderson from Midas Resources.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  We all know when a company acts irresponsibly, divesting ourselves in a move towards safety is prudent.
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  When the market becomes volatile, U.S. Treasuries are a safe haven.
[22:17.000 --> 22:22.000]  But what do you do when the U.S. government overextends itself and spends beyond its means?

[24:08.000 --> 24:10.000]  Imagine.
[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  We pay our taxes to offshore banks.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  That's what the Federal Reserve is.
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  A holding company.
[24:17.000 --> 24:24.000]  And all over the nation, they're banning gun sales in major cities and small towns, you name it.
[24:24.000 --> 24:32.000]  They've got the police chief in the article saying, well, gun sales in the city cause law enforcement too many problems.
[24:32.000 --> 24:38.000]  How about cops just come to our door and tell us to come massage their feet or mow their yards?
[24:38.000 --> 24:39.000]  You can't have a protest.
[24:39.000 --> 24:40.000]  It's too much trouble for us.
[24:40.000 --> 24:42.000]  You can't have guns sold in the city.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  It's too much trouble for us.
[24:43.000 --> 24:47.000]  Oh, we're God, you know, just pay the taxes and shut up.
[24:47.000 --> 24:54.000]  Freeborn said that even though there won't be a rally and his group will not be involved.
[24:54.000 --> 24:56.000]  Wow, easily discouraged.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  Ohioans for concealed carry is expected to assemble at City Hall for a protest.
[25:01.000 --> 25:02.000]  March.
[25:02.000 --> 25:04.000]  It will start at 2 p.m. Saturday.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  So everybody in Ohio needs to go to this town and be part of this.
[25:07.000 --> 25:11.000]  The march is to protest an ordinance that bans the sale of guns in the city.
[25:11.000 --> 25:20.000]  The ordinance bans all gun sales within city limits, but was in the process of being amended to exclude private sales by residents.
[25:20.000 --> 25:30.000]  The intent of the ordinance is to prohibit gun stores in the city and was drafted by a Hubbard man's attempt to open a gun repair shop on Robertson Road in October.
[25:30.000 --> 25:32.000]  You can't let slaves open a gun shop.
[25:32.000 --> 25:36.000]  I mean, come on, can't let slaves sell their neighbor a gun.
[25:36.000 --> 25:42.000]  Law Director Mark Plomatic advised the council in March to repeal the ordinance, which violates Ohio law.
[25:42.000 --> 25:46.000]  But we don't need any stinking law saying they can't have a March violates law.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  But so what?
[25:48.000 --> 25:51.000]  Ohioans for concealed carry threatened to sue the city over the ordinance.
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.000]  The ordinance has the support of the city's police who say gun stores pose a problem for their understaffed department.
[25:57.000 --> 26:01.000]  Yeah, because all the money goes to the banks now, so they're cutting cops.
[26:01.000 --> 26:06.000]  So the cops just say, look, you can't protect yourself. We're not going to protect you. No guns, pay me money.
[26:06.000 --> 26:08.000]  I'm a thug.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  The ordinance was tabled and sent back for committee consideration.
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.000]  It's expected to be brought to a vote soon.
[26:16.000 --> 26:21.000]  Rich says he doesn't remember the city charging organizations $2,000 to assemble in the past.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  This is insane.
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  She said, aren't they on duty anyway?
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  And why do you need that many policemen?
[26:27.000 --> 26:28.000]  It's a peaceful rally anyway.
[26:28.000 --> 26:31.000]  No, these are scum Americans that think they're still in America.
[26:31.000 --> 26:38.000]  Rich said the ordinance is expected to be repealed, but there likely will be opposition to that action.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Oh, there you go. That's America.
[26:40.000 --> 26:51.000]  Let me tell you, every time I go out and have a rally, almost every time I got a face down Austin cops that just absolutely don't know what country they're living in and think I'm bad.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  And all these people play into it going and getting the stinking permits.
[26:54.000 --> 26:57.000]  You don't need a stinking permit.
[26:57.000 --> 27:01.000]  My permit was paid for with the blood of our forefathers.
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  It's called the First Amendment.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  If you don't like it, get out of my country.
[27:06.000 --> 27:07.000]  Leave.
[27:07.000 --> 27:10.000]  Stop telling me that this isn't a republic.
[27:10.000 --> 27:12.000]  Stop telling me that I don't have rights.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  Stop telling me that you're my master.
[27:14.000 --> 27:15.000]  You are not scum.
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  Do you understand that?
[27:17.000 --> 27:18.000]  I am the boss.
[27:18.000 --> 27:20.000]  I am a citizen.
[27:20.000 --> 27:21.000]  We run this country.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  Not a bunch of offshore banks.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  Do you get that through your stinking head?
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  And no amount of stage terror attacks.
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  No amount of racist signs that you have your feds go out and put up blaming on us.
[27:32.000 --> 27:35.000]  No amount of your propaganda is going to work.
[27:35.000 --> 27:37.000]  That's why all the major news is losing its ratings.
[27:37.000 --> 27:43.000]  The newspapers are going bankrupt because everybody knows you're a pack of scum.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  Let me get to that right now.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  This is out of the examiner.
[27:48.000 --> 27:52.000]  Hating the government finally goes mainstream.
[27:52.000 --> 27:55.000]  This is American as apple pie.
[27:55.000 --> 28:02.000]  Three years ago, the American presidential candidate, Republican, let me continue.
[28:02.000 --> 28:08.000]  Three years ago, the Republican establishment piled scorn on the presidential candidacy of Ron Paul.
[28:08.000 --> 28:15.000]  Today, he is in a statistical tie with President Obama in 2012, doing better than any other GOP candidate against him.
[28:15.000 --> 28:24.000]  His son, an ophthalmologist who's never run for elected office, is well ahead of not only the GOP's hand-picked candidate for the Senate in Kentucky,
[28:24.000 --> 28:28.000]  but also both Democratic contenders, all statewide office holders.
[28:28.000 --> 28:38.000]  And notice, for the first time ever in Kentucky or any other state, they're letting the head of the state election commission run against Ron Paul and run his own election.
[28:38.000 --> 28:42.000]  See, he's just lawless evil.
[28:42.000 --> 28:43.000]  What happened?
[28:43.000 --> 28:51.000]  Did America suddenly develop an insustainable appetite for 74-year-old cranky congressroom from Texas?
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  Is the gold standard catching on?
[28:54.000 --> 28:59.000]  And it goes on from there, how the American people are waking up, and it's only going to get better.
[28:59.000 --> 29:03.000]  And go ahead, Feds, I wish you wouldn't, but go ahead and bomb your building.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  Go ahead and blow up some building.
[29:05.000 --> 29:12.000]  The Feds will pick one that has a daycare center in it and have video cameras out there when they run out with bleeding kids and try to blame it on us.
[29:12.000 --> 29:13.000]  It won't work.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  If everybody knows the FBI was there with the BATF running the operation, that's been declassified.
[29:18.000 --> 29:20.000]  Everybody knows now.
[29:20.000 --> 29:21.000]  It's not going to work.
[29:21.000 --> 29:22.000]  Go ahead and try to set me up.
[29:22.000 --> 29:23.000]  Not going to work.
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.000]  None of it's going to work.
[29:24.000 --> 29:25.000]  Trash.
[29:25.000 --> 29:26.000]  You understand that?
[29:26.000 --> 29:27.000]  It's our country.
[29:27.000 --> 29:28.000]  It's over.
[29:28.000 --> 29:29.000]  There's nothing you can do.
[29:29.000 --> 29:30.000]  The idea is out there.
[29:30.000 --> 29:31.000]  Liberty's out there.
[29:31.000 --> 29:32.000]  Freedom's out there and growing.
[29:32.000 --> 29:33.000]  We know your tricks.
[29:33.000 --> 29:35.000]  More people are waking up every day and learning your tricks.
[29:35.000 --> 29:47.000]  And once we have your playbook, which we do have, once the general public has the playbook and finds out it's there and knows all your stinking tricks, game over scumbags, go ahead, have Barry Sitaro set off a nuke in America and blame it on the patriots.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  That's not going to work either.
[29:48.000 --> 29:49.000]  Trash.
[29:49.000 --> 29:50.000]  It's over, Trash.
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  We're on the march.
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  The Empire's on the run.
[29:54.000 --> 29:59.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.000 --> 30:03.000]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[30:03.000 --> 30:09.000]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[30:09.000 --> 30:14.000]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[30:14.000 --> 30:16.000]  Food is your only ammunition.
[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  How much do you want?
[30:17.000 --> 30:18.000]  When do you want it?
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  Now or after the battle starts.
[30:20.000 --> 30:21.000]  When will you need it?
[30:21.000 --> 30:23.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  Will there be any food?
[30:24.000 --> 30:26.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[30:26.000 --> 30:31.000]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.000]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[30:39.000 --> 30:40.000]  How much will you need?
[30:40.000 --> 30:41.000]  We don't know.
[30:41.000 --> 30:42.000]  How much do you want?
[30:42.000 --> 30:43.000]  All you can get.
[30:43.000 --> 30:44.000]  I'm Alex Jones.
[30:44.000 --> 30:47.000]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[30:47.000 --> 30:54.000]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[30:54.000 --> 30:59.000]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[30:59.000 --> 31:01.000]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[31:01.000 --> 31:06.000]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[31:06.000 --> 31:11.000]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[31:11.000 --> 31:17.000]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[31:17.000 --> 31:22.000]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[31:22.000 --> 31:29.000]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[31:29.000 --> 31:33.000]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way,
[31:33.000 --> 31:37.000]  and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[31:37.000 --> 31:42.000]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com, that's survivalseedbank.com,
[31:42.000 --> 31:47.000]  or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[31:47.000 --> 31:51.000]  That's 877-327-0365.
[31:51.000 --> 31:56.000]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[31:56.000 --> 31:59.000]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[31:59.000 --> 32:07.000]  Most people know that drinking pure high alkaline pH water is the most important factor in maintaining high energy and vibrant health.

[32:54.000 --> 33:20.000]  269-409-1776 today.
[33:25.000 --> 33:30.000]  So who are you?
[33:30.000 --> 33:33.000]  What shine are you on in history?
[33:33.000 --> 33:39.000]  They were in the Whitehead or the Black Hat?
[33:39.000 --> 33:48.000]  Are you for the authoritarian parasite control freaks or are you for the real men and women of this planet?
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  Yeah, we're not pretending.
[33:51.000 --> 33:56.000]  What if I say I'm not like the others? What if I say I'm not one of your little play things?
[33:56.000 --> 33:59.000]  Somebody's going to go along with your propaganda and brainwashing.
[33:59.000 --> 34:03.000]  What if I say the jig's up and I'm aware of your operations?
[34:03.000 --> 34:14.000]  So Ron Paul in a statistical dead heat, winning major straw polls, coming in second in straw polls against Mitt Romney.
[34:14.000 --> 34:22.000]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run. Here's another one. 65% hold populist or mainstream views.
[34:22.000 --> 34:26.000]  This is Rasmussen polls. It says anti-government mistrust.
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  Is it all time highs?
[34:28.000 --> 34:35.000]  65% of voters nationwide now hold populist or mainstream views of government.
[34:35.000 --> 34:40.000]  See, it's now mainstream. There's now cents.
[34:40.000 --> 34:44.000]  That's up from 62% last September and 55% last March.
[34:44.000 --> 34:49.000]  Oh, with another year or two, it'll be 70 plus percent.
[34:49.000 --> 35:01.000]  Mainstream Americans tend to trust the wisdom of the crowd more than their political leaders and are skeptical of both big government and big business.
[35:01.000 --> 35:07.000]  While Republicans and unaffiliate voters are more likely to hold mainstream views than Democrats.
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  And see, a few years ago mainstream would mean believing the government in the media.
[35:11.000 --> 35:17.000]  Now it's mainstream not to. A majority of those in the president's party, 51% hold such views.
[35:17.000 --> 35:22.000]  So a majority of Democrats don't trust the government.
[35:22.000 --> 35:27.000]  Only 4% now support the political class.
[35:27.000 --> 35:38.000]  Because that strongly don't like the government 65, but strongly support the government 4%.
[35:38.000 --> 35:40.000]  Only 4% now support the political class.
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  These voters tend to trust political leaders more than the public at large and are far less skeptical about government.
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  And most of them are on the government payroll.
[35:50.000 --> 35:52.000]  So there you have it.
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.000]  Kind of like most polls show over 90%, the lowest is in the mid 80s, know the government killed Kennedy.
[35:58.000 --> 36:05.000]  But they got less than 10% sitting up there on TV telling us we're all cooks.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  I've seen an Angus Henry New York Times poll.
[36:07.000 --> 36:13.000]  2006, 84% of Americans believe the government's lying about what really happened on 9-11.
[36:13.000 --> 36:18.000]  Hmm.
[36:18.000 --> 36:21.000]  Hmm.
[36:21.000 --> 36:25.000]  What's that mean for you crooks that stage the terror attacks?
[36:25.000 --> 36:29.000]  You're going to sit up there thinking the public's weak-minded on your national television shows,
[36:29.000 --> 36:33.000]  slickly produced, telling us we're cooks and anti-American.
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  It doesn't work anymore.
[36:35.000 --> 36:40.000]  When you go do anti-9-11 truth hit pieces, people who never thought it was an inside job start researching,
[36:40.000 --> 36:44.000]  and they go, wait a minute, if these guys are lying about everything else and they stood to gain from it,
[36:44.000 --> 36:53.000]  I better look into it if the news is telling me 9-11 truthers want to kill Obama with no evidence.
[36:53.000 --> 36:57.000]  I better look into that.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  And they do look into it.
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  And the rest is history.
[37:01.000 --> 37:04.000]  Okay, I've got stacks of these articles and I'm going to cover it more.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  I want to go to calls here in a moment.
[37:06.000 --> 37:09.000]  But Tea Party pranksters rally against real group.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  This is out of K.O.B., Eyewitness Television.
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  You could call it a tax day trick.
[37:15.000 --> 37:20.000]  Fake signs are popping up around the metro area that advertise a fake Tea Party rally on tax day.
[37:20.000 --> 37:26.000]  The Albuquerque Tea Party doesn't know who's putting up the signs and trying to ruin the real Tea Party group.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  And what is it?
[37:29.000 --> 37:36.000]  Oh, there's signs all over the country popping up saying, I don't like the IRS inward.
[37:36.000 --> 37:39.000]  I don't like Obama inward.
[37:39.000 --> 37:44.000]  Or images of hillbillies with potbellies saying, I don't like the government.
[37:44.000 --> 37:48.000]  And this is a foundation-funded, Democratic Party-funded operation.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  AP's reported all the people that have been caught are linked into the coffee party.
[37:53.000 --> 37:56.000]  Started two months ago by an Obama high-level New York Times operative.
[37:56.000 --> 37:58.000]  All on record.
[37:58.000 --> 38:03.000]  And they had all this CNN, MSNBC coverage for a month last April 15th.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  And their biggest rally had 14 people at it.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  Most of them had one to three in major cities.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  Yes, you can muster three people, U.S. government.
[38:12.000 --> 38:15.000]  Good job trash.
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.000]  Good job scum.
[38:21.000 --> 38:27.000]  The Albuquerque Tea Party says it's not responsible for these signs and not affiliated with anyone posting them around town.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  Anytime you stand up, somebody's going to want to stand up against you.
[38:30.000 --> 38:33.000]  Anytime you do something, you're going to have a nice fair.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  But see, now they're doing false flags.
[38:36.000 --> 38:44.000]  Now they're saying that they've rallied people in 65 major cities to go out and pose as racist and other things.
[38:44.000 --> 38:50.000]  Just like the Black Congressional Caucus got caught a month ago with the healthcare passage marching through the Tea Party,
[38:50.000 --> 38:53.000]  trying to get somebody to attack them or call them an inward.
[38:53.000 --> 38:57.000]  And it didn't work.
[38:57.000 --> 39:00.000]  And now the media gets discredited further.
[39:00.000 --> 39:03.000]  And now people are having the idea introduced.
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  Wait a minute. Who are these anarchists?
[39:05.000 --> 39:08.000]  Wait a minute. Who are these people? Who are these groups?
[39:08.000 --> 39:11.000]  Why do they say they're anarchists, but they're literally, when you go to their events,
[39:11.000 --> 39:15.000]  there are a bunch of people wearing red stars and linen tattoos.
[39:15.000 --> 39:19.000]  I mean, literally, go to one. It'll blow you away.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  Cops have been caught all over the world, all over the U.S.,
[39:22.000 --> 39:25.000]  posing as anarchists, attacking other officers.
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.000]  It's over, criminals. It's over.
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  Oh, there's a long war coming up, an info war, and you're going to try to make it physical.
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  And you're going to run hoaxes saying, I'm calling for violence.
[39:36.000 --> 39:40.000]  And they're also going to pose as patriots and attack me.
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  And they're also going to pose as white supremacists.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  Why do you think white supremacists for over a decade have made me their number one enemy,
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  called for my death, everything else?
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  Because they're feds, Hal Turner, all of them. They've all been caught.
[39:53.000 --> 39:56.000]  They're meant to radicalize the debate.
[39:56.000 --> 39:59.000]  And so, of course, all those sites and radio shows attack me.
[39:59.000 --> 40:02.000]  You know, their latest thing is they create fake Facebook accounts,
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  saying that they are Rothschilds.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  We accept anybody to our Facebook accounts, and there's a bunch that aren't even mine.
[40:07.000 --> 40:11.000]  Then they say, look, it's a Rothschild. Alex is with a Rothschild.
[40:11.000 --> 40:14.000]  And the same Facebook account has someone saying they're Elvis.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  Look, Alex is with Elvis. He's alive.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  That's the best the feds can come up with.
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  And that blew up in their face this week.
[40:21.000 --> 40:25.000]  I noticed those fed-run sites took all that down because it totally revealed them.
[40:25.000 --> 40:29.000]  You know, just continue it. Continue.
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  Continue all of it.
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  Reveal yourself.
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  Show us who you are.
[40:35.000 --> 40:38.000]  Come on.
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  Make up even more lies about me.
[40:40.000 --> 40:44.000]  Say I'm threatening to kill people, threatening to kill them,
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  or threatening to kill the president.
[40:46.000 --> 40:48.000]  Go ahead, lie, lie.
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  Get even more wild with your lies.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  I got the truth.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  I got you down politically any day of the week.
[40:55.000 --> 40:58.000]  I got a sword that's on fire that you can't stop.
[40:58.000 --> 41:00.000]  You understand that?
[41:00.000 --> 41:03.000]  You can't stop me. You can't destroy me.
[41:03.000 --> 41:08.000]  You can kill me, but the idea is out there and it's never going away.
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  Because what we do is the truth. It's evergreen.
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  It just keeps going and going and going.
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.000]  And everything the establishment does is based on lies and deceit and spin.
[41:16.000 --> 41:20.000]  And so all your info only hurts you.
[41:20.000 --> 41:24.000]  You're firing blanks.
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  Here's another one from PrisonPlanet.com.
[41:26.000 --> 41:30.000]  Racist provocateur posing as Tea Party here threatens to shoot Obama.
[41:30.000 --> 41:34.000]  And we've confirmed this with the sheriff's department in Oklahoma,
[41:34.000 --> 41:38.000]  and this is happening everywhere.
[41:38.000 --> 41:44.000]  We get these calls here over the years at the office with unknown numbers.
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  And they call up leaders and they say,
[41:46.000 --> 41:53.000]  hey, let's get violent. Hey, we ought to try to assassinate Obama.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  And all over the country, they're making call after call after call after call
[41:57.000 --> 42:02.000]  trying to set people up while they put out the news that we are calling for this.
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.000]  But it's not going to work.
[42:05.000 --> 42:10.000]  Hold fast, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.000]  Paul Joseph Watson, either the feds are up to their old tricks again
[42:13.000 --> 42:16.000]  or some of the individuals behind the Crash the Tea Party campaign
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  are taking things too far.
[42:18.000 --> 42:25.000]  Muskogee Tea Party leader, Jameson, fought.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  And it goes on from there.
[42:29.000 --> 42:34.000]  Received a call yesterday from a man who tried to get him to agree to shooting the president
[42:34.000 --> 42:41.000]  a clear attempt to entrap as anarchists prepare to stage false flags
[42:41.000 --> 42:47.000]  today's tax rallies in an effort to frame the Tea Party movement as violent radicals and racist.
[42:47.000 --> 42:52.000]  And this is being done strategically to the militias, to conservatives, to gun groups.
[42:52.000 --> 42:55.000]  They're trying to ban rallies, ban free speech.
[42:55.000 --> 42:59.000]  We talked to, in fact, try to get him on for 10 minutes in the last hour.
[42:59.000 --> 43:05.000]  The founder and head of Oath Keepers, Stuart Rhodes,
[43:05.000 --> 43:07.000]  because we posted his press release yesterday.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  They had to cancel their D.C. gun rally because the feds were so mad about it.
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  That's why I told you you can't really have a big gun rally in D.C.
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  They always do this.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  People claiming to be Oath Keepers and 3% said,
[43:18.000 --> 43:22.000]  we're going to show up with guns, we're going to get violent.
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  And I don't know if it was wise what Rhodes did.
[43:25.000 --> 43:28.000]  Might have well just shown up and used this as a strategic victory
[43:28.000 --> 43:35.000]  by exposing these people as feds when they did it.
[43:35.000 --> 43:37.000]  I probably would have gone ahead with it.
[43:37.000 --> 43:41.000]  But maybe he's wise to just point out they're trying to provocateur.
[43:41.000 --> 43:45.000]  But if we allow them to do this on every front, they'll just shut us down.
[43:45.000 --> 43:47.000]  And they're wily, folks.
[43:47.000 --> 43:50.000]  I mean, you can show up and operatives will then say,
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  you're not supposed to be here, get out of here, you're bad.
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  And then edit video and do other things,
[43:54.000 --> 43:57.000]  or they'll use weak-minded people that they'll provocateur
[43:57.000 --> 44:00.000]  to create an illusion of a fight going on.
[44:00.000 --> 44:03.000]  They've got a lot of different programs and tactics,
[44:03.000 --> 44:09.000]  and we've learned how to identify them.
[44:09.000 --> 44:16.000]  Law-abiding Tea Partiers are apparently baffled by what's happening.
[44:16.000 --> 44:20.000]  And law-abiding Tea Partiers are apparently being infiltrated
[44:20.000 --> 44:24.000]  and made to look extreme, writes Andrew W. Griffin of the Oklahoma Watchdog,
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  growing evidence points to provocateurs that bring to mind
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  the protest of the Vietnam War era and Cointel Pro.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  But then they go through all the evidence of it, now it's in the mainstream news.
[44:34.000 --> 44:37.000]  A very important article we'll cover more later.
[44:37.000 --> 44:40.000]  Here's another one.
[44:40.000 --> 44:44.000]  Beaverton Teacher faces investigation over Tea Party infiltration.
[44:44.000 --> 44:47.000]  Not only is he a teacher, he's got huge city contracts.
[44:47.000 --> 44:49.000]  Jason Levin to run their computers.
[44:49.000 --> 44:53.000]  The Portland man who caused a ruckus over his plans to infiltrate
[44:53.000 --> 44:56.000]  Tea Party protests and an aim to discredit them
[44:56.000 --> 44:59.000]  teaches in a Beaverton Middle School
[44:59.000 --> 45:03.000]  and now faces an investigation by the Teacher Standards and Practices Commission.
[45:03.000 --> 45:08.000]  And the AP reported that his site crashed the Tea Party that we first exposed here
[45:08.000 --> 45:16.000]  ahead of the AP is calling to pose as racist, pose as extremist, pose as crazies,
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  go out with fake signs.
[45:18.000 --> 45:22.000]  This is racketeering, in my humble opinion, and of course an older article,
[45:22.000 --> 45:30.000]  a 2008 race worker held in damage to Colorado HQ Denver Post, Democratic Party Headquarters.
[45:30.000 --> 45:34.000]  Democratic Party Headquarters has an arrest record in a history of helping
[45:34.000 --> 45:37.000]  a Democratic political candidate public record show.
[45:37.000 --> 45:40.000]  Again, one of the two people suspected of shattering 11 windows Tuesday morning
[45:40.000 --> 45:43.000]  at the state Democratic Party headquarters has an arrest record
[45:43.000 --> 45:48.000]  and a history of helping Democratic political candidates public record show.
[45:48.000 --> 45:51.000]  And it turned out they let her flat out on it.
[45:51.000 --> 45:53.000]  Okay, all right, I'm gonna go to your calls.
[45:53.000 --> 45:55.000]  I said I was and we're running out of time here
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.000]  because Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is coming up in Lord Christopher Monkton.
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  And I've got all this other news I want to get into.
[46:00.000 --> 46:03.000]  But right now, let's go to Herman in New York.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  Herman, you're on the air worldwide.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  Yes, hello. How are you? Can you hear me?
[46:07.000 --> 46:09.000]  Yes, sir.
[46:09.000 --> 46:13.000]  Yes, I have two questions, but first I want to make one point.
[46:13.000 --> 46:15.000]  You're absolutely right.
[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  You're beating the war drum.
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  Rachel Maddow is coming out with some special,
[46:19.000 --> 46:27.000]  it's all about Timmy T. McVeigh and she's incorporating that with anti-government movement
[46:27.000 --> 46:30.000]  and every single time they talk about anti-government movement,
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  they also talk about terrorism and everything you're saying is pretty much being called...
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  And I told you for three months, they're building towards
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  mid and late April for stage terror attacks.
[46:43.000 --> 46:46.000]  Absolutely, but my two questions are number one,
[46:46.000 --> 46:49.000]  why is the Anglo-American establishment targeting Iran?
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  And the second question is, after they're finished with Iran,
[46:54.000 --> 46:57.000]  which country do you believe they'll target next?
[46:57.000 --> 46:58.000]  Thank you.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  Very good questions. I appreciate the call, Herman.
[47:01.000 --> 47:06.000]  Because England, well, was it 80-plus years?
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  You can pull up the history.
[47:08.000 --> 47:12.000]  Iran, Iran, they had conquered it.
[47:12.000 --> 47:19.000]  They'd also conquered Pakistan and tried to conquer Afghanistan in a similar time period.
[47:19.000 --> 47:23.000]  They've been unsuccessful in Afghanistan, successful in Pakistan.
[47:23.000 --> 47:26.000]  And that was a bridge into the Middle East and their control of India.
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  Everybody knows the British Empire ran India until the 50s
[47:30.000 --> 47:36.000]  with Mahatma Gandhi and his nonviolent revolution, which we're calling for.
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  But really, it's a restoration here.
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  We're trying to go back to what we had.
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  We're trying to get freedom. They never had it.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  We're trying to go back to the freedom.
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  So we're restorationists, but it's similar.
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  We're not revolutionaries. Be clear.
[47:48.000 --> 47:51.000]  We're restorationists. We aren't legitimate.
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  That's very important.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  We have the moral high ground. We have the historical high ground.
[47:56.000 --> 48:02.000]  And so Anglo-American oil, now basically BP, they split it up.
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  Dutch roll shells, partners.
[48:05.000 --> 48:09.000]  They were making 100% of the profits in Iran.
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  And Mohammed Mosedek, who was secular, a Westerner trained in England,
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  pro-West, Time Magazine man of the year, in 1951-52,
[48:19.000 --> 48:22.000]  he said, look, we just want to keep 25% of the oil money.
[48:22.000 --> 48:26.000]  I want to build some schools. I want to industrialize our nation.
[48:26.000 --> 48:30.000]  Modern mathematics and astronomy was invented, of course, in Persia,
[48:30.000 --> 48:36.000]  the very first world folks, except for some of the minority groups in some of the areas.
[48:36.000 --> 48:39.000]  But the point is, it's as advanced as you get.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  I mean, the people have, you know, per capita, some of the highest IQs,
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  similar to Japanese and Northern Europeans.
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  The point is, they're very smart people there.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  People we should be working with.
[48:48.000 --> 48:51.000]  And the West said, oh my gosh, this guy's wearing a suit and tie.
[48:51.000 --> 48:54.000]  This guy wants to build universities.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  And they hired hardcore Muslim extremists.
[49:03.000 --> 49:06.000]  And they went in and staged terror attacks and blamed on Mohammed Mosedek
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  and sacked the Muslim extremists.
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  Then they doubled back on them, brought the Shah in.
[49:10.000 --> 49:14.000]  They killed 300,000-plus people, torturing them to death.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  And in 79, there was about to be a revolution against the Shah,
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  and the evidence is clear.
[49:21.000 --> 49:25.000]  The CIA flew in out of Paris, the Ayatollah Khomeini,
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  and they did the arms for hostages deals.
[49:27.000 --> 49:31.000]  Then the Ayatollah doubled back on them in 1982
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  and made a break with the deal he'd made with the CIA.
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  And that made them even matter.
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  That made them even matter.
[49:37.000 --> 49:41.000]  And so, it's on record, the CIA.
[49:41.000 --> 49:44.000]  But the Muslims, the Shiites, doubled back and triple crossed them.
[49:44.000 --> 49:47.000]  So that was even more rage.
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  You're not going to industrialize.
[49:49.000 --> 49:52.000]  You are not going to let your people know, know, know.
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  And so they went in, Donald Rumsfeld said,
[49:54.000 --> 50:00.000]  we've got 40 billion cash and weapons in CIA satellite system advisors.
[50:00.000 --> 50:04.000]  We've got the nerve gas, hit them and hit them hard, invade Iran.
[50:04.000 --> 50:08.000]  And Saddam Hussein went in hardcore.
[50:08.000 --> 50:12.000]  And so, the globalists hate the Iranian people.
[50:12.000 --> 50:16.000]  They want to have a regime in that vaccinate some of the cancer viruses
[50:16.000 --> 50:19.000]  that puts fluoride in their water just like they hate us.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  They hate anybody who's strong, anybody who's smart.
[50:22.000 --> 50:23.000]  They hate the Serbs.
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  They hate anybody who's independent and smart.
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  And they hunt them down, they take them over,
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  and they poison their water, and they abort their children,
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  and they hire police with black ski mask,
[50:31.000 --> 50:34.000]  and they roll in our blood and orgy in our pain,
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  and they just froth around with enjoyment.
[50:37.000 --> 50:40.000]  Anyone who isn't collectivist, anyone who isn't a control freak,
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  must be brought down.
[50:42.000 --> 50:47.000]  After they attack Iran, they're going to continue their encirclement of Russia and China.
[50:47.000 --> 50:53.000]  And they're going to continue attacking the American people with their police state.
[50:53.000 --> 50:54.000]  They got a lot of other targets.
[50:54.000 --> 50:58.000]  They may double back on Libya, areas of Yemen,
[50:58.000 --> 51:00.000]  Sudan.

[52:02.280 --> 52:04.280]  We are part of a new world order.
[52:04.280 --> 52:07.280]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[52:07.280 --> 52:12.280]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[52:12.280 --> 52:17.280]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[52:17.280 --> 52:19.280]  It means all the world under their control.
[52:19.280 --> 52:25.280]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[52:25.280 --> 52:33.280]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[52:33.280 --> 52:38.280]  I believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[52:38.280 --> 52:41.280]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[52:41.280 --> 52:47.280]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.

[54:24.280 --> 54:28.280]  Herb and Ohio, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[54:28.280 --> 54:32.280]  Alex, thank you. I think you're a great patriot and I appreciate all you do.
[54:32.280 --> 54:37.280]  One thing I want to tell you. I travel a lot. I hand out about 10,000 videos a year.
[54:37.280 --> 54:44.280]  I was on a plane on my way to Florida and I'm next to a guy.
[54:44.280 --> 54:50.280]  I said, hey, you want a video? He said, sure. What's it about? It's about the New World Order.
[54:50.280 --> 54:54.280]  He said, oh, that sounds interesting. So I give him a couple videos.
[54:54.280 --> 55:00.280]  I turn to the guy on my left. I said, you want a video? He says, well, is that one of those Alex Jones things?
[55:00.280 --> 55:06.280]  I said, yeah. He says, oh, I know all about him. We've been warned about him.
[55:06.280 --> 55:18.280]  And I said, what do you mean? And he says, well, he tells me he's a minister or pastor and he's already been warned about you.
[55:18.280 --> 55:28.280]  Yeah, they have clergy response teams. Last time we got government numbers two years ago, it was 50 plus thousand strong who are under secret FEMA contracts in a subgroup of InfraGuard.
[55:28.280 --> 55:40.280]  That's declassified. This is not a joke. And they brainwashed law enforcement pastors. We've confirmed this no exaggeration over 100 times that one of the top training things is now to say Alex Jones is evil.
[55:40.280 --> 55:46.280]  Don't listen to him because I know history. I tell the truth and I devastate the enemy.
[55:46.280 --> 55:58.280]  When I said to him, I said, you're a pastor. And I said, and you're not warning people about this. And he says, well, we have already been explained to us.
[55:58.280 --> 56:05.280]  We've been to the seminars and so on. And I told him, I said, well, you're just a traitor. How dare you call yourself a Christian pastor?
[56:05.280 --> 56:11.280]  I said, you're working for the enslavement of mankind. And I kind of went off on this guy on the plane.
[56:11.280 --> 56:19.280]  And I ended up telling the guy he was a traitor. He was a traitor to his country. He was a traitor to his God.
[56:19.280 --> 56:34.280]  And I ended up having about 25 to 30 people after I had this kind of a big flare-up came to me during the flight and asked me if I had any videos that they could look at because they wanted to know what it was all about.
[56:34.280 --> 56:41.280]  So, I mean, it was just, it was, you know, turned into what could have been, you know, like kind of an intimidation.
[56:41.280 --> 56:43.280]  Oh, yeah, we've been...
[56:43.280 --> 56:49.280]  Well, you did a great job, but you should have said, oh, let me guess, you're part of the clergy response team.
[56:49.280 --> 56:50.280]  Because we have...
[56:50.280 --> 56:55.280]  Well, that's what I did. I actually said that to him. I said, oh, so you're working for FEMA.
[56:55.280 --> 57:04.280]  And he says, well, he says, I wouldn't say I'm working for them. And he says, you know, I said, well, you're part of...
[57:04.280 --> 57:12.280]  So I told him, so then you're involved with the clergy response team. So you're working for FEMA, whether you're getting a paycheck directly from them or not, not right now.
[57:12.280 --> 57:21.280]  I said, you're working for them. And that was kind of, I went off on this guy for about five or 10 minutes, you know, and that's eventually why a lot of people came over.
[57:21.280 --> 57:23.280]  They want to know what it was all about.
[57:23.280 --> 57:25.280]  But as I say, I...
[57:25.280 --> 57:28.280]  What was he saying by the end?
[57:28.280 --> 57:35.280]  Well, he was saying, you know, oh, how dare you call me a traitor? I'm a pastor. I'm a Christian. Don't you tell me I'm a traitor to God?
[57:35.280 --> 57:42.280]  And I said, I don't know how else to call it if I just, you know, call a spade a spade. I said, you're a traitor.
[57:42.280 --> 57:49.280]  Well, think about how creepy it is that, and this is two years old, they went from 13,000 to 20 plus thousand to 50,000.
[57:49.280 --> 57:56.280]  So it was basically doubling every year. So I would guess now it may be 150,000, but we know it's 50,000.
[57:56.280 --> 58:03.280]  Secretly in meetings with FEMA being told to tell their flocks to go to FEMA camps, turn their guns in, Alex Jones is bad.
[58:03.280 --> 58:08.280]  And this was all under Bush with the face-based initiative. And now it's expanded under Obama.
[58:08.280 --> 58:13.280]  I mean, that's not freedom. That's secret police each Germany, Creepville.
[58:13.280 --> 58:19.280]  And what does that tell you about, but again, they got the white supremacists, they got the liberal media, they got George Soros,
[58:19.280 --> 58:27.280]  they've got Southern Poverty Law Center, all coming after me from every angle, and only by the grace of God am I not in prison or still alive.
[58:27.280 --> 58:40.280]  I mean, they are really upset because my listeners are getting the videos out to everyone and we launch a new weapon in the info war today and another weapon next Wednesday.

[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:21.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:27.280]  Coming up in the next hour, Lord Christopher Monkton, one of the key Tea Party speakers in Washington,
[01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:33.280]  will be joining us on government-run healthcare in England, on all the latest on Climate Gate.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.280]  Devastating news has broken this week of the systematic fraud. That's coming up.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:42.280]  We're going to premiere my newest documentary that I've produced that Jason Burma has directed.
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:47.280]  Invisible Empire, New Order Defined at 3 p.m. Central Today when the show ends.
[01:00:47.280 --> 01:00:53.280]  We have something special we're going to do that you're going to be amazed by coming up in the last hour as well.
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:57.280]  He announced two and a half weeks ago that he's retiring from his twice a week column.
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.280]  He's a former Wall Street Journal editor, the father of Reaganomics, the head of policy department of Treasury.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:06.280]  And, of course, his new book is How the Economy Was Lost, The War of the Worlds.
[01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:09.280]  Paul Craig Roberts. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is with us.
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:13.280]  And before he sails off into the sunset, at least for a while, taking a break,
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.280]  he's agreed to do a couple of interviews with us. He did one last week, and now he's back on Tax Day this week
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:23.280]  to talk about the economy, the value added taxes, all the things, the carbon taxes they're calling for,
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:29.280]  and what he talked about last week, the systematic destruction by design of our economy,
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:34.280]  the total conversion to basically Mexico or another third world nation,
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:37.280]  where you have a tiny elite and a giant underclass.
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:40.280]  Dr. Roberts, great to have you here with us today, sir.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.280]  Pleased to be with you, Alex.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:48.280]  You look good there with your Skype connection. I see you've got Napoleon Bout of part on the wall behind you.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:57.280]  Yes, somebody gave me that some years ago when the president of France gave me the French legion of Otto.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:05.280]  And so I can't remember who it was. Somebody gave me this very romantic picture of a copy.
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:13.280]  It was a copy of the romantic portrayal of Napoleon that's in the Louvre in Paris.
[01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:18.280]  Wow. Yeah, you never brag about all the laurels you've got in one of the top ten economists living on the planet.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:23.280]  You know the drill. We're going to break in about three minutes, but you wanted to come on on Tax Day.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:27.280]  We're honored to have you here where you won't be censored. Break it down for us.
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:33.280]  Well, you know, Alex, one of the great myths is that Americans are free people.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:38.280]  And once upon a time they were, but they've not been free since 1913.
[01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:44.280]  Because once you have an income tax, you no longer own your own labor.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:53.280]  And the historic definition of a free person is a person who owns his own labor.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:59.280]  If you don't own your own labor, you are a serf or a slave.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.280]  So all Americans are either serfs or slaves, depending on the bracket.
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:13.280]  There are no free Americans and have not been any free Americans since 1913.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:22.280]  So when you hear our leaders such as George W. Bush talk about we have freedom in democracy.
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.280]  You certainly don't have freedom. You're a serf.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:36.280]  All serfs were required to turn over 20, 30% of their labor time to the government of their day.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:43.280]  A slave has to turn over about half of his labor time to his owner.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:49.280]  And Americans fall in between those two ranges.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:04:01.280]  So every American who works and earns an income is either serf or slave or in between that margin.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:09.280]  And that is simply the historic definition of a free person agreed to by the liberals,
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:14.280]  by Karl Marx, by the conservatives, by all historians.
[01:04:14.280 --> 01:04:18.280]  That is the definition of a free person.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:23.280]  We don't meet that definition. And people should be aware of this.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.280]  And that's the real message of April 15.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:33.280]  It reminds you every year that you're not a free man or woman.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:43.280]  You are a serf of the government who has a claim to what, one-third of your income.
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:48.280]  Or more. Stay there, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. We'll look at the history of the income tax,
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:53.280]  how it's been accelerating and expanding, and a lot more, and how we try to shake off this bondage.
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:05:00.280]  And your phone calls. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts with us in the next hour. We're very honored to have him.

[01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:35.280]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:41.280]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:07:41.280 --> 01:07:44.280]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[01:07:44.280 --> 01:07:49.280]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:08.280]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.280 --> 01:08:12.280]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:19.280]  Many times when Congressman Ron Paul is on Fox or CNN or MSNBC, they'll say,
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:22.280]  you're against the government. You hate the government.
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:24.280]  How are we supposed to fund our country?
[01:08:24.280 --> 01:08:28.280]  And many times he's standing in the capital or the capitals behind him.
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:30.280]  And he says, well, we built this capital.
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:35.280]  Our country had a 10% growth rate on average until 1913 when we got the income tax
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.280]  that you will notice is in the communist manifesto.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.280]  So is a private central bank. And we have been turned into serfs, not just with the income tax,
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:48.280]  but property tax is a rent, serfs payday, property tax as well.
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:52.280]  And since 1913, it just expands and expands and expands and expands.
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:58.280]  Now the bankers, Volcker and others, want to value added tax, sales taxes, carbon taxes,
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.280]  it's all being announced.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:04.280]  Former Wall Street Journal editor, for those that just joined us, father of Reaganomics,
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.280]  is our guest, Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, author of How the Economy Was Lost,
[01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:15.280]  The War of the Worlds. Paul Craig Roberts is with us here live today on Tax Day.
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:18.280]  Sir, please continue where you left off in the last segment,
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.280]  our journey from liberty to serbitude and serfdom.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:28.280]  Oh, Alex, the phone has started ringing. Can I get up and turn it off?
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.280]  Sure, go ahead. You've got to love live TV here on radio.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.280]  And for those that just joined us, we are live at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.280]  You can see all the great awards Dr. Roberts has in the back, including the Legion of Merit from France.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:45.280]  That's their highest award. He is something else. Never even knew he had that.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:48.280]  But got to love live TV.
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:52.280]  Okay, Dr. Roberts, continuing, recapping our journey to serfdom,
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:56.280]  and now it's only accelerating deeper into bondage.
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:10:02.280]  Well, you know, the main point, Alex, was that a free person owns his own labor.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:07.280]  And an income tax means the government has the first claim on your labor,
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.280]  just like feudal lords did, or a slave master.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:15.280]  And so Americans are not free and haven't been for almost a century now.
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:20.280]  For three years, short of a century, of living as serfs,
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.280]  while the government tells us we have freedom.
[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:29.280]  You know, under the Constitution, the income tax is unconstitutional.
[01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:37.280]  And certainly nobody in the latter part of the 18th century was going to propose an income tax,
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:46.280]  since it was so close to the time that serfs were becoming free labor, as opposed to serfs.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:52.280]  And so the notion of having the government have a claim on your labor
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:58.280]  would have been seen as a step back into the dark ages or into the medieval period.
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:01.280]  And so how did we get the income tax?
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:06.280]  Well, the Democrats wanted it to get the rich, and they got one passed,
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:11.280]  and it was ruled unconstitutional, and they had to have a constitutional amendment.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:20.280]  And the way they got it, if my memory serves, the Republicans wanted a higher tariff
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:23.280]  to protect the industries.
[01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:27.280]  During our great growth period, we had high tariffs.
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:32.280]  We did not develop on the basis of free trade.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:37.280]  So in order to get the tariff, the Democrats said,
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:42.280]  look, tariffs are like sales taxes, and they're aggressive,
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:46.280]  and people have to pay it who don't have a lot of money.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:57.280]  If you will go along with letting us have a go at a constitutional amendment on the income tax,
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:11:59.280]  we'll let you have your tariff.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:05.280]  And the Republicans all said, well, you know, the states will never pass this,
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.280]  so let's make the deal so we can get a higher tariff.
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:15.280]  So they made the deal, and when it went out to the states,
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:21.280]  the states looked at it and said, well, look, look how much money you have to have
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.280]  before you even hit a 1% income tax rate.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:29.280]  Nobody in our state has that much money.
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.280]  We don't care if this passes, it doesn't affect us.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:40.280]  And so it passed because the majority of the states came to the conclusion
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.280]  that nobody in the state had an income that large.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:50.280]  But of course, as soon as it's in, World War I starts.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:53.280]  And of course, they want to finance the war.
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:59.280]  And so all of a sudden, the thresholds at which the tax comes in are lowered,
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:06.280]  the rates at which are charged, raised, and the whole population is almost subject to the income tax,
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.280]  which was only going to be for the rich.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:16.280]  So that's how it happened, that's how it came in to effect.
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:25.280]  It was a miscalculation as a part of a deal to be able to raise a tariff
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.280]  in exchange for giving the Democrats a goal at the Constitutional Amendment
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:35.280]  to make income tax permissible.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.280]  Well, Dr. Roberts, let me add a caveat before you continue.
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:45.280]  We noticed in the same year, 1913, we get the income tax to now fund the new central bank
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.280]  that so many of our forefathers had fought against.
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:53.280]  As Thomas Jefferson said, if you allow private corporations and banks to issue currency and credit,
[01:13:53.280 --> 01:13:58.280]  you will wake up homeless on the continent your forefathers conquered.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:03.280]  And we also, that same year, got the 17th Amendment taking the senators from the states,
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:07.280]  voted on by the legislatures, and making them federal creatures.
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.280]  So further dominating the states.
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:16.280]  And so the central banks that helped, and private banks that helped ram this through,
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:19.280]  did it in the name of getting the rich guys, the robber barons,
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.280]  but really the robber barons that helped them vertically integrate the economy.
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:27.280]  And now we see the super rich today vertically integrating the economy
[01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:33.280]  and waging war on the economy, economic warfare through this system almost 100 years later.
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:39.280]  That's true, and that's one of the subjects of my recent book, How the Economy was Lost.
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:48.280]  You gave a very good summary of what happened, all of it in the name of reform.
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:56.280]  And of course, the reforms destroyed the federal structure and gave us the powerful central government.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.280]  You know, the Civil War did a great job in destroying states' rights,
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:15.280]  but certain amounts of it remained until 1913.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:22.280]  Dr. Roberts, I want to talk more about the income tax and all the new taxes they want to pile on that are similar.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.280]  But what about the states and property taxes?
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:29.280]  Many states didn't have property taxes until the last 20, 30 years and they go up and up and up.
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:34.280]  That's a classic feudal surf tax where you didn't own the land you were on,
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:40.280]  you were the keeper of it, but you had to pay a percentage to the nobles.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:47.280]  Yes, of course, property taxes really aren't affordable,
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:54.280]  because even if you rent from a landlord, he has to pay the tax so it goes into the rent.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:16:04.280]  Property tax, the reason given for that and what was used was to fund public schools.
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:11.280]  So you find the public school system based on the property tax,
[01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:21.280]  and therefore this made it free, so to speak, since property tax wasn't affordable
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.280]  and people paid the property tax, so they used public schools
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:31.280]  and this was a great setback to private education,
[01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:39.280]  and it was another mechanism for government to condition the thinking of people,
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:47.280]  to brainwash them through time, to make them think that they are free and have democracy,
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.280]  so they are the service of the government.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:56.280]  The government has a very powerful claim on their income.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:59.280]  Let me illustrate that a little bit more.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:04.280]  Back during the slavery period in the United States,
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:09.280]  there were slaves who had special skills.
[01:17:09.280 --> 01:17:16.280]  They were craftsmen, they were highly trained in some aspect of arts and crafts,
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:25.280]  and their labor was worth more than working in the cotton fields or working on the plantation.
[01:17:25.280 --> 01:17:35.280]  So what would happen is the owners of the slave would lease the slave to a businessman in a city or town,
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:43.280]  and the man who leased the slave would withhold half of the slave's earnings
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:47.280]  and send it back to the owner and give the other half to the slave,
[01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:57.280]  which he used to maintain himself in town where he lived on his own resources after tax.
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:00.280]  Well, that's the way it works today.
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.280]  Most people cannot avoid income tax because they never get the money.
[01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:07.280]  It's withheld at the source.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.280]  And by the way, we've seen this new hoax by AP and others,
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:15.280]  and we see it all over the news that 47% of Americans don't pay income tax after deductions,
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.280]  but what is FICA and social security?
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:22.280]  Don't they know that their employers are just paying them less because they have to pay all those other taxes
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:25.280]  and matching social security? FICA?
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:31.280]  I mean, this lie that 47% of the public are avoiding taxes as a hoax, is it not?
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:33.280]  Yes, it's a hoax.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.280]  Most of the things they tell you are a hoax.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:39.280]  They also tell you the rich don't pay taxes.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:44.280]  But the IRS statistics of income show that the rich pay almost all the taxes
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.280]  because they have much of the income.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:55.280]  And so just about everything people think they know about the income tax system is wrong.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:19:02.280]  Well, now there are some international corporations, though in offshoring, they are avoiding a lot of taxes.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:09.280]  Not necessarily. You see, you're taxed on your worldwide income.
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:16.280]  If you're paying, if you're a global corporation, say you're operating in the United States and say you're, for example,
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:25.280]  and you're taxed in Germany and France, then that income is an offset to those earnings.
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:31.280]  And it is not, again, taxed by the United States government.
[01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:38.280]  So it's not really the case that they can avoid taxes.
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.280]  All right, stay there. We got a break then.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.280]  Why then do we see the mega corporations always lobbying for more taxes
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:48.280]  or the big health care insurance companies lobbying for health care?
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:53.280]  We'll ask Dr. Roberts that question when we come back and talk about where he sees this nation going.
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:56.280]  As he said last week, the economy is being destroyed by design.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.280]  We'll get him to expand on that.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:01.280]  For The Starter Roberts, I'm Alex Jones.

[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:15.280]  I'm Don from New Mexico. January of 2000, I had a heart attack. Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:23:15.280 --> 01:23:17.280]  My health was a mess, pretty much.
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.280]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:23:19.280 --> 01:23:30.280]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better. My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:35.280]  Experience these benefits and more when your body gets what it needs with the assistance of heart and body extract.

[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:22.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, again, our guest, joining us on April 15, 2010. I want to open the phones up for Dr. Roberts, 1-800-259-9231. We'll take a few calls before he leaves us.
[01:24:22.280 --> 01:24:37.280]  This is a short segment, fleshing out, expanding on that point you're making that they're destroying the economy by design. Why? Why are some of the biggest corporations in the world with government pushing to turn people into indentured servants?
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:25:00.280]  Well, I think to make people aware of that fact is probably more important than to know all the reasons why. A lot of it is a result of unintended consequences, and most of the rest is a result of short-term greed.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:17.280]  The way the incentive structure for top management corporations is structured, it gives them a very short-term horizon. They want to know what the profits are in the next quarter. The longest horizon they have is four quarters.
[01:25:17.280 --> 01:25:44.280]  And in the way these things are structured, their bonuses they get for performance far, far exceeds their regular salaries. So they make themselves multimillion-dollar incomes by moving American jobs offshore, because they then replace American labor with very, very inexpensive foreign labor
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:26:07.280]  in countries where there is huge surplus of unemployed labor. In China, for example, a couple hundred million unemployed people to draw on. So by severely cutting their labor costs, the profits jump dramatically and they get enormous bonuses.
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:24.280]  And that's the basic source of it, and it's why the prospects, the economic prospects for millions of Americans are gone, and not just people live today, but future generations.
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:40.280]  The kinds of jobs that college graduates used to get are simply disappearing. They're moved abroad, or they are filled with foreign guest workers on H1B visas and L1 visas.
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:27:01.280]  And so it's actually making the universities redundant. Why in the world did you go pursue university careers with the notion of some professional career that's been destroyed by the offshoring of the jobs? So it's having a tremendous adverse impact on the United States.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:15.280]  And you and other economists talk about how these jobs aren't coming back. It took hundreds of years to bill what we've got, now just a few decades to destroy it. There was open discussion by the IMF and World Bank now of the dollar going down.
[01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:28.280]  They're saying they need more bailouts, VAT taxes, sales taxes, carbon taxes. When any economist worth their salt knows an astalling economy, you throw more taxes on, that will just accelerate the economy's implosion.
[01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:41.280]  That's right. You see, by wrecking the economy, they have worsened the trade deficit dramatically. They have worsened the federal budget deficit, which they can no longer finance.
[01:27:41.280 --> 01:27:47.280]  And that is a threat to the dollar as reserve currency, which is a threat to their power of the United States.
[01:27:47.280 --> 01:28:05.280]  And so now it looks like the hard-pressed Americans could be hit with new forms of oppressive taxation, such as a value-added tax on top of the income and social security tax and state sales taxes and property taxes.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:24.280]  So by putting the dollar into jeopardy and having to rescue the dollar in order to rescue the power of the American military superstate, they have to drive the population, or 96% of it, deeper into the ground.
[01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:42.280]  And that's exactly what is on the agenda. And the result for the American people is going to be horrific. They're going to be put through the mill in a way that people haven't experienced in the longest, longest time.
[01:28:42.280 --> 01:28:58.280]  Yeah, this taxation rate is much higher for my study than what caused the colonies to rebel, but also they were having fake courts, royal courts that bypassed juries, and the right of Magna Carta and habeas corpus.
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:06.280]  And you look at all those parallels, they're identical to what led up to 1775, 1776, but magnified.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:21.280]  Yes, it's all a repeat, isn't it? The habeas corpus is gone, due process is gone, the attorney-client privilege is gone, now they force attorneys to rattle their clients.
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:36.280]  But of course, you know, one difference is the population a couple hundred years ago was more feisty. And there wasn't much difference between the weaponry in the hands of people and the weaponry in the hands of the state.
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:44.280]  Stay there, let's talk about that when we come back. Long segment coming up with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. I'm Alex Jones, M4Wars.com and PrismPlanet.TV are the websites.
[01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:50.280]  And when the show ends today at three o'clock central, we're premiering the new film, Invisible Empire and PrismPlanet.TV.
[01:29:50.280 --> 01:30:00.280]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:09.280]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:21.280]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:31.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:44.280]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:31:01.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:01.280 --> 01:31:20.280]  With the implementation of Codex Alimentarius, it is clear that we must act quickly to avoid losing our freedom of choice where personal health preferences are concerned. As of January 1, 2010, Codex Alimentarius was implemented within the European Union, resulting in the restricted sale of many natural supplements, including colloidal silver.
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:40.280]  We must take immediate steps to assure a continuing supply of colloidal silver for ourselves and our families. Action now to acquire the means of producing this beneficial supplement in the privacy of your own home. Colloidal silver is a powerful antipathogenic used for more than 200 years as a natural alternative to costly drugs and their dangerous, unpredictable side effects.
[01:31:40.280 --> 01:31:54.280]  Go to www.silvalungs.com for more information on how to secure your freedom of choice by producing your own colloidal silver right from home. That's www.silvalungs.com.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:32:11.280]  Hi this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:32:11.280 --> 01:32:29.280]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:32:29.280 --> 01:32:47.280]  And here's the best part, these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full-acre crisis garden. So visit them today at www.survivalseedbank.com. That's www.survivalseedbank.com, or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:59.280]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:26.280]  We're now shipping Invisible Empire New World Order to find on DVD. You can also support us by purchasing it. It's part of the win-win.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:44.280]  Exposing the New World Order, the global corporate fascist state, two-plus-hour film, Jason Bermas I produced it, now available at infowars.com. We have police state, the rise of FEMA coming out next week that I've made over the last year, proving this police state control grid and at the FEMA camps do indeed exist.
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:34:02.280]  Going back to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. Separately on the police state, regardless of the Emergency Centers Act, regardless of the John Warner Defense Authorization Act, Patriot Act, we know U.S. citizens are being grabbed. The military is torturing them. They are holding them without trial. All of this is going on.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:10.280]  The denial needs to end about the level of tyranny accelerating in our society.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:24.280]  Well, Alex, I don't know how much of it goes on, but what we do know for certain is that they have removed the barriers to it and can do it whenever they want. They can grab wherever they want.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:48.280]  We had, you know, the head of Homeland Security fairly recently saying that Homeland Security was shifting its attention from foreign terrorists to domestic American extremists. And we had not long ago the arrest of a blonde, blue-eyed woman as a terrorist.
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:35:03.280]  So they're already moving away from the Muslim threat. They used that to get all of those police state measures in place, and now they can apply them to the general population.
[01:35:03.280 --> 01:35:21.280]  But Alex, before we go off into that, let me say one more thing about the income tax. Many progressives in liberals get disturbed at criticisms of the income tax because they think it's used for the poor.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:40.280]  I was on a show just the other day where the host thought the income tax paid for public schools and roads. And I was unaware that the road system was built with gasoline tax and that the public schools have funded the property tax.
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:36:06.280]  But let me just make a point about the use of the income tax revenues. The last week, David Lindoff published an article in which he said, if you add up all of the military spending, not just the Pentagon's budget, but all of the other related military spending that's dispersed throughout the budget in other departments,
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:29.280]  and the Supplementals for the Wars and the CIA and so forth, that it comes to 53% of the federal income tax revenues so that more than half of the federal income tax revenues are used to fund the military.
[01:36:29.280 --> 01:36:54.280]  Now, this is an extraordinary thing. I don't think it was this bad doing the dark ages. But if you have the military function of the government, which has now 53% of the inserved labor goes to support, this is an extraordinary thing.
[01:36:54.280 --> 01:37:11.280]  And it gives the military security complex such power, because a lot of these funds are recycled into political campaign contributions, that it's almost impossible to budge this.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:28.280]  Now, if you look at the size of the American budget and then you military spending, the total thing that Lindoff presents, then you add in that of all of our allies in Europe, Japan, and then the nations that are friendly to us.
[01:37:28.280 --> 01:37:48.280]  It accounts for two thirds of world military spending. And so, how do we face the threat? How is Iran a threat? Now, this is really very interesting, because Iran's annual military budget is $4.8 billion,
[01:37:48.280 --> 01:38:04.280]  which costs maybe what, two weeks of our war in Afghanistan. $4.8 billion is what the Pentagon spends on childcare and recreation. It's what it spends on its replacement helicopters.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:19.280]  Or one or two stealth bombers. So here is Iran with a military budget equal to what the Pentagon spends on childcare and recreation. And it's a threat to America.
[01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:37.280]  Amazing. Now, going back, you were Ronald Reagan's chief financial market advisor, the father of Reaganomics, had a policy at the Treasury. What about the Grace Commission? Because my reading of that boils down to not one red cent of it goes to the American people or to run the country.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:54.280]  From my reading, much of the money goes to interest on the debt, does it not? Well, now. And one way they are keeping that down is the Federal Reserve is buying so much of the debt in order to hold down the interest rate.
[01:38:54.280 --> 01:39:10.280]  But the minute that blows up, which it has to sooner or later, the cost of carrying the debt is going to be horrific. What if the, you remember the short-term interest rates that Volcker stuck on, you know, 17 percent?
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:23.280]  I can remember when long-term treasuries, when I went into the Treasury, the interest rate on long-term treasuries was 16 percent. Can you imagine those kinds of interest rates today?
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:41.280]  Well, let me ask you that. They're now talking about raising interest rates. A, what will that do? And then, B, we've got Volcker, Obama, and people like Glenn Beck calling for sales taxes, value-added taxes, carbon taxes, saying we've got to pay this.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:40:04.280]  Well, the carbon tax, in my opinion, is something that Wall Street and the corporations have cooked up. And the purpose of the carbon tax is to make pollution profitable, because you can now buy and sell the right to pollute, and of course Wall Street will turn it into derivative.
[01:40:04.280 --> 01:40:07.280]  Sure, but what will that do to the economy?
[01:40:07.280 --> 01:40:31.280]  I don't think that that is the threat to the economy. They may not help, but the threat is another unregulated, over-counter, derivative instrument in which pollution becomes profitable, so it doesn't help the environment.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.280]  What does VAT do?
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:55.280]  VAT drives up the price of everything people buy. It's a very high-sales tax, a federal sales tax. What it does is it taxes the value added to a product at every stage.
[01:40:55.280 --> 01:41:06.280]  So if we say, okay, we go dig up the iron ore, and so the act of digging the ore out of the ground, that makes it more valuable because it's now accessible.
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:22.280]  So the difference in the value of the ore on the ground and the value of the ore dug out, that difference is value added in this taxed. And then the iron ore is converted into iron or steel, and that is another enhancement of value.
[01:41:22.280 --> 01:41:30.280]  And that value is taxed, and then the steel is converted into products, car or steel beams, whatever, a sheet metal.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:33.280]  Then it's packaged, then it's shipped, then it's sold.
[01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:44.280]  In fact, at every level. And the value added taxes in Europe are 20%, 22%. They may be higher now.
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:42:02.280]  And so that then becomes an enormous sales tax. That's why cars cost so much in Europe. That's why washing machines and dryers and appliances and refrigerators and stuff, they all have this tax.
[01:42:02.280 --> 01:42:04.280]  And fuel.
[01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:14.280]  And fuel. So it's a way of suppressing the purchasing power and living standards of people.
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:21.280]  And then meanwhile, if China and India and others don't have a VAT, won't that drive the few industries we have left out of the country?
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:34.280]  Well, you see, the value added tax is rebated on exports, but it's applied to imports.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:44.280]  So a country that has a value added tax in a trade situation has an advantage over one that doesn't.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:53.280]  Because when Europe exports these products to us, they rebate that tax.
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:57.280]  But we don't have any industry really left, as you've said, so that isn't good.
[01:42:57.280 --> 01:43:04.280]  And we don't have the value added tax, and so it doesn't come in taxed.
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:15.280]  But if it goes from one value added country to another, when it leaves, it's rebated, but when it gets to the other country, it's charged.
[01:43:15.280 --> 01:43:22.280]  All right, Dr. I want to move quickly through some other subjects, but going back to overall taxes because you wanted to come on today and we're honored to have you.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:28.280]  Specifically, other points you'd like to make about the income tax that I want to ask you, where do you see all this leading?
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:37.280]  Because, I mean, clearly, this is a vertical integration, a criminal consolidation, they have no appearances of even slowing down, only accelerating.
[01:43:37.280 --> 01:43:40.280]  How do you see this unfolding?
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:50.280]  Well, the people and the vast majority of Americans will find a sharp decline in their living standard.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:44:10.280]  And there's no way, there's no way around it because not only are the jobs, the best jobs, disappearing, but all of these taxes will particularly value added tax will seriously reduce their purchasing power.
[01:44:10.280 --> 01:44:20.280]  If you had a 20% value added tax, for example, it means that 20% of your purchases that you currently have are wiped out.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:25.280]  And so you see a 20% reduction in your real income.
[01:44:25.280 --> 01:44:36.280]  Expanding on that, the trick again is they've had fake conservatives promoting VAT for almost two decades saying we're going to get rid of the income tax.
[01:44:36.280 --> 01:44:40.280]  They're saying, oh, no, we're going to have the income tax and the VAT, but don't worry, it'll only be 2%.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.280]  Well, that's how the federal income tax started.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.280]  Right, that's right.
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:45:04.280]  You know, as we said earlier in your program today, the reason the income tax amendment passed, the constitutional amendment, meant one, was that the vast majority of states didn't have anybody living in them that had income higher enough to be taxed under the original proposal.
[01:45:04.280 --> 01:45:08.280]  So sure, once you have, but the same thing happens, state sales taxes.
[01:45:08.280 --> 01:45:13.280]  I can remember when the first sales tax was 1%.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.280]  What are they now?
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:16.280]  6, 7, 8.
[01:45:16.280 --> 01:45:22.280]  So if it's a 2% value added tax, it won't be 2% very long.
[01:45:22.280 --> 01:45:25.280]  Very quickly rise up as in Europe.
[01:45:25.280 --> 01:45:30.280]  And as I said, they're 20% or more.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:37.280]  Where all this may end is that the dollar may simply collapse.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:49.280]  It may lose its reserve currency role, in which case it will be the end of the evil empire because the wars won't be, you can't finance them.
[01:45:49.280 --> 01:45:57.280]  The only way they can finance all of these wars and all this military spending is that the dollar is a reserve currency.
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:00.280]  We can pay our bills simply by printing money.
[01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:02.280]  Nobody else can do that.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:18.280]  So if we lose that role, then you will see a collapse in the empire and you will also see a collapse in living standards because it would have a similar effect as a value added tax in reducing people's incomes.
[01:46:18.280 --> 01:46:28.280]  Because the value of it would fall dramatically and so all of the imports on which we are dependent would rise in price.
[01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:32.280]  And this would also have the effect of reducing Americans' real incomes.
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:40.280]  So for the future, Alex, it's going to be different than the past when people could look forward to a rising level of income.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:46.280]  Now I'm afraid they'll have to look forward to declining levels of real income.
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:49.280]  I want to take a few calls here in the end of this segment and the next with you.
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.280]  We really appreciate you spending time with us.
[01:46:51.280 --> 01:46:58.280]  But, you know, we know there's some global organization of this, but it's driven by the degree, the short-term view.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:00.280]  But at the UN level, it's a long-term view.
[01:47:00.280 --> 01:47:12.280]  But it lends credence to what you're saying that it's just a bunch of looters and not organized at some point because I'm reading in Texas and in Ohio and in Michigan and New Jersey and all over.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:22.280]  More than 10 states going bankrupt are on the verge. Some sheriffs and police departments slashing by more than half, police saying buy your own guns to protect yourself.
[01:47:22.280 --> 01:47:39.280]  As taxes go up, more and more goes to interest on the debt and to corporate welfare and actual road warrior-type scenarios where one county in Ohio that has over 100,000 people will have one cop-on-duty for every shift from 116 that they had.
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:46.280]  But I mean this, we're looking at potential road-warrior-type collapse.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:57.280]  Could be. It could be. I think most likely, though, the last thing government will let go of are the forces that protect them.
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:06.280]  And the notion that the police protect the public is probably not correct. The police protect the government.
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:18.280]  If you think the FBI protects you, you're wrong. Just like the military doesn't protect the people, it protects the government that pays its salary.
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:33.280]  So I'm not sure that a lot of the gang activity won't come from police because they're an organized armed force.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.280]  People are not organized.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:46.280]  That's a key point. They said in Ohio they were going to keep 49 of the 116 deputies and that now only one would be on patrol for the citizens the rest out collecting revenue.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:52.280]  So now they're admitting we're here to collect revenue. We're not going to protect you. They actually say that.
[01:48:52.280 --> 01:49:00.280]  That's right. And, you know, they can collect revenues in a different way than taxes and just shake you down.
[01:49:00.280 --> 01:49:07.280]  So who knows, Alex, we don't need to get this far into it.
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:14.280]  We can't predict what the behavior will be that closely.
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:21.280]  But we do know that the kinds of restraints that restrained government power are being removed.
[01:49:21.280 --> 01:49:22.280]  Yes.
[01:49:22.280 --> 01:49:38.280]  And we do know that the sort of economy we had that produced rising consumer incomes is being dismantled and that the more likely prospect is falling consumer incomes.
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:46.280]  So you get a mixture of a weaker poor public and a stronger, less accountable government.
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:50:07.280]  And that is enough to make us disturbed and wary when you see the people becoming economically weaker and the government becoming less accountable and more powerful, less restrained by law, by the Constitution.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.280]  And that is the real dilemma that we're in. Can I hold up my book real quickly?
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:13.280]  Absolutely.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:27.280]  This is the latest book I've written and a lot of people who get motivated to try to learn something about economics, they get a book and they try to read it and they can.
[01:50:27.280 --> 01:50:31.280]  It's full of jargon. It's sky equations. It's dense.
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:39.280]  This book is written like a column for a newspaper and people can follow it.
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:44.280]  You're a great writer and we've got the book holding it up on TV ourselves.
[01:50:44.280 --> 01:50:45.280]  How the economy was lost.
[01:50:45.280 --> 01:50:47.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, I promise to take calls.

[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:07.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:53:07.280 --> 01:53:12.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:18.280]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:23.280]  So our friends at Solutions From Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:30.280]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:38.280]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:57.280]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:00.280]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:09.280]  All right, Lord Christopher Monk, it's coming up. For those of you that are holding, you'll get to talk to him.
[01:54:09.280 --> 01:54:12.280]  We'll just not going to hang up on the callers. I should have gone to your call.
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:19.280]  Mr. Roberts has so much knowledge. I have so many questions. Jamming in a few calls. Jim in Missouri, you're on the air with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:35.280]  Hey, Mr. Roberts. It's really nice to talk to you. You've got a lot of experience on taxes and everything else and where you came from in life as far as all the information has been provided to you.
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:45.280]  I guess my question to you would be, in all of your research, what would the average individual knowing...
[01:54:45.280 --> 01:54:48.280]  Okay, so they read your books and follow some...
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:50.280]  What do we do about this? Is that the question?
[01:54:50.280 --> 01:55:02.280]  Well, yeah. The average individual is just going to take this as a grain of salt. They don't have no direction to counter-direct the government.
[01:55:02.280 --> 01:55:10.280]  So I guess my question to you is, if you were able to provide some sort of a movement, how would you...
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:15.280]  I understand the question. Thank you, Jim. What do we do about this, Dr. Roberts?
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:22.280]  Well, we may not be able to do anything about it until it just falls apart.
[01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:32.280]  Though, you know, last week in one of the stands, part of the former Soviet Empire was the Kyrgyzstan.
[01:55:32.280 --> 01:55:36.280]  All of a sudden, the people just revolted and threw the gun out.
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:43.280]  And they did this despite being fired on by troops.
[01:55:43.280 --> 01:55:55.280]  So at some point, maybe people will have nothing left to lose and will revolt.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:03.280]  The only other solution is a long-term solution of restoring veneration of the Constitution.
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:08.280]  So that people say that's what's important is protecting the Constitution.
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:14.280]  They can't do anything that undermines the Constitution or the restraints that it places on government.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.280]  But that would take a long time. The law schools would have to have a change of mind.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:21.280]  They would have to teach a generation of law students.
[01:56:21.280 --> 01:56:27.280]  They would have to enter into the judiciary, especially the federal judiciary.
[01:56:27.280 --> 01:56:30.280]  And the bar associations would have to change.
[01:56:30.280 --> 01:56:33.280]  Instead, the criminals have gotten in and brought in all their people.
[01:56:33.280 --> 01:56:35.280]  But I agree. We need to put out the message of...
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:40.280]  Gangster. Looting. We have a government of looters.
[01:56:40.280 --> 01:56:47.280]  Or we have a government rather controlled by organized looting groups.
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:54.280]  The big offshoring corporations, Wall Street, these are all gangster operations.
[01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:57.280]  Well, absolutely. By every yardstick, by every measurement.
[01:56:57.280 --> 01:57:02.280]  But I think it's important also just to point out their criminals and give people the alternative of the Republic,
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:07.280]  of the Bill of Rights, of the Constitution, so that people can recognize this tyranny and counter.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:12.280]  I mean, I'm sure you saw the Wall Street Journal where they admit that NBC and others have propaganda placement
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:17.280]  or behavior placement in the shows, brainwashing people with federal funds.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:23.280]  That's right. And of course the federal government pays people to go on to internet sites
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:28.280]  and try to discredit anybody that speaks the truth.
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:33.280]  And the State Department does this. And it's also used worldwide.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:37.280]  They use it to try to destabilize governments that aren't American puppets.
[01:57:37.280 --> 01:57:42.280]  So there's a tremendous use of propaganda.
[01:57:42.280 --> 01:57:49.280]  It's very difficult for American people to ever get a firm grasp on what the real situation is.
[01:57:49.280 --> 01:57:55.280]  They're too busy trying to have a living, pay the rent, hold on to their home or whatever.
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:58.280]  Doc, we're out of time. I appreciate the hour on tax day.
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:03.280]  And I know you're about to take some time off and hopefully you'll be back doing talk radio in the future,
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:05.280]  how the economy was lost, the war of the worlds.
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:07.280]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, here's the book.
[01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.280]  Dr. Roberts, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:12.280]  Well, thank you for sharing your audience, Alex.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:15.280]  You bet. God bless you. Have a good weekend coming up.
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:18.280]  Lord Christopher Monk did coming up on a host of issues.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:21.280]  He's hosting one of the big tea parties in D.C.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:28.280]  Don't forget, we've got two new films launching this week and next week today, premiering in two hours.
[01:58:28.280 --> 01:58:35.280]  Premiering two hours from now at prisonplanet.tv, Invisible Empire, a new order defined in the next week,
[01:58:35.280 --> 01:58:40.280]  Police State, The Rise of FEMA. We'll be right back. Stay with us.

[01:59:02.280 --> 01:59:11.280]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:59:11.280 --> 01:59:19.280]  They're so bright in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:24.280]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:59:24.280 --> 01:59:29.280]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:36.280]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[01:59:36.280 --> 01:59:40.280]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection,
[01:59:40.280 --> 01:59:45.280]  so you can ride all day with confidence. Order yours at gusset.com.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:53.280]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.

[02:00:05.280 --> 02:00:11.280]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[02:00:11.280 --> 02:00:17.280]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.280 --> 02:00:24.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:30.280]  Journalist, consultant, scientific researcher, top advisor to Margaret Thatcher,

[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:43.280]  The third Lord, Abrentually, joins us and I am really honored to have him on with us for the next hour.
[02:00:43.280 --> 02:00:47.280]  He's in D.C. for one of the huge Tea Party events today, coming up in a few hours.
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:50.280]  He'll give us the location, the time, the place.
[02:00:50.280 --> 02:00:55.280]  Then we're going to chronicle all the new information that dwarfs Climategate
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:59.280]  and the White Wash in England by the government.
[02:00:59.280 --> 02:01:08.280]  I mean, just absolutely outrageous and where the U.N. and others are going with their push in Mexico City
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:14.280]  to try to set up this world government. Lord Moncton, great to have you on with us, sir.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:19.280]  Well, it's a real joy to be with you once again and God bless everyone who's listening.
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:23.280]  And on Tax Day, God bless America. You need all the help you can get.
[02:01:23.280 --> 02:01:30.280]  I hear your taxes are getting as high as France almost. Well, first off, tell us about the event today.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:36.280]  Well, the event today, of course, is the culmination of the great Tea Party Express that began in Searchlight, Arizona,
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:40.280]  which is Harry Reid's seat, as you know, with Sarah Palin kicking things off.
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:46.280]  She was in Boston yesterday and was getting huge cheers from the crowd when she said,
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:54.280]  I want to tell my left-wing friend this, that conservative women are hotter. Well, I've got one more thing to add to that.
[02:01:54.280 --> 02:01:58.280]  Conservative guys are hotter too, especially if they have a British accent.
[02:01:58.280 --> 02:02:07.280]  Anyway, it's now made all its way through to Washington, D.C., where the final rally takes place on Tax Day.
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:17.280]  This evening, East Coast time between the kind of 5 p.m. and 10 p.m. at the Washington Monument,
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:22.280]  which is, for those of you who haven't been here before, is an enormous needle of marble,
[02:02:22.280 --> 02:02:26.280]  the largest freestanding marble structure in the world.
[02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:32.280]  And it's right there opposite the White House, where we are told that Barack Hussein Obama
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:36.280]  will probably be cowering behind the drapes in the Oval Office.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:43.280]  Yes, it's a giant, I guess, ziggurat or obelisk. You can't miss it with its aluminum capstone.
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:48.280]  Lord Monkton, we're about to go to break, but there's so much happening, I've got all my questions,
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:55.280]  but what is most important on your battleboard as you look at the whole array of our forces growing,
[02:02:55.280 --> 02:03:01.280]  the enemy's forces vanquish on many levels, but regrouping like serpents?
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:06.280]  Well, of course, they still intend to take democracy and freedom away forever,
[02:03:06.280 --> 02:03:12.280]  and President Obama and the administration will do everything they can to make sure
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:21.280]  that the UN's green global government is cemented into place so that your constitution will no longer matter
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:26.280]  and so that freedom, democracy and prosperity will be gone forever.
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:32.280]  I went to Bonn recently for the UN conference to plan for the next conference,
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:36.280]  which, as you rightly mentioned, is in Cancun in Mexico this December.
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:41.280]  They follow on from the collapsed Copenhagen conference last December.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:47.280]  They were still issuing copies of the September 15th draft of the Copenhagen Treaty,
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:53.280]  the draft that didn't make it to Copenhagen, which lays out in 186 pages the program
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:04:01.280]  for a world government with powers to suspend and control and set the rules of all formerly free markets,
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:05.280]  which would, of course, disappear, the powers of enormous taxation,
[02:04:05.280 --> 02:04:10.280]  and you really can't take much more tax than you've already got here in the United States,
[02:04:10.280 --> 02:04:16.280]  and then also powers of intervention in not only the environmental but the economic affairs
[02:04:16.280 --> 02:04:22.280]  of all nations directly over the heads of their elected representatives
[02:04:22.280 --> 02:04:25.280]  and, of course, will this world government be elected?
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:32.280]  Does the word election, democracy, ballot or vote or any such word occur anywhere in the 186 pages
[02:04:32.280 --> 02:04:36.280]  of this blueprint for the end of democracy worldwide?
[02:04:36.280 --> 02:04:38.280]  No, of course it does not.
[02:04:38.280 --> 02:04:43.280]  Lord Monkton, we're going to come right back with a long segment, break down the enemy blueprints
[02:04:43.280 --> 02:04:49.280]  that time and time again by the grace of God and good spies continue to fall into our hands
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:56.280]  on a weekly basis and all the new scandals absolutely proving systematic, organized fraud
[02:04:56.280 --> 02:05:00.280]  by the collectivist parasites to push their Green New World Order.
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:04.280]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[02:05:04.280 --> 02:05:10.280]  Tyranny is here. The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:05:10.280 --> 02:05:12.280]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:18.280]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:24.280]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:30.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[02:05:30.280 --> 02:05:34.280]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:05:34.280 --> 02:05:39.280]  Repair to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:45.280]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:48.280]  Only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:51.280]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:26.280]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children sick?
[02:06:26.280 --> 02:06:31.280]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:35.280]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:41.280]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.

[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:07.280]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:07.280 --> 02:08:25.280]  Lord Christopher Moncton is our guest, probably the leading crusader with the most accurate information of the last 15-plus years,
[02:08:25.280 --> 02:08:31.280]  fighting the Green New World Order as the UN calls it in its internal documents.
[02:08:31.280 --> 02:08:37.280]  For those that just joined us, Lord Moncton is in Washington today for a huge Tea Party event starting 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:40.280]  in front of the Washington Monument. You cannot miss it.
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:44.280]  Sir, flesh this out because, I mean, walk through this world government they're setting up,
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:52.280]  these incredible documents that continue to get leaked and declassified and stolen by some that are being put out.
[02:08:52.280 --> 02:08:57.280]  I mean, really gives us a picture and lets us know there's no longer any denial.
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:09:04.280]  This is open global tyranny and we now have the head of the Gaia movement over in England last week and the London Guardian
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:11.280]  calling for a global dictatorship saying we can't have freedom, the people are, quote, too stupid, we must have rationing.
[02:09:11.280 --> 02:09:23.280]  I mean, these are open tyrants, even Hitler and the communists and other despots were not this open selling tyranny as if it's mother's milk.
[02:09:23.280 --> 02:09:28.280]  That's a wonderful phrase, selling tyranny as if it's mother's milk. I must remember that one.
[02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.280]  That'll do well in speeches, I think. I think you're quite right.
[02:09:32.280 --> 02:09:42.280]  There is an extraordinary failure of will on the part of the peoples of formerly democratic nations like Britain, for instance,
[02:09:42.280 --> 02:09:46.280]  which now lives under the dictatorship of the European Commissar.
[02:09:46.280 --> 02:09:53.280]  And of course, it's therefore very easy now for people like the leader of the Gaia movement to come out and say,
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:59.280]  we want dictatorship because of course we've already got dictatorship in Europe and we've already got cap and tax
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:04.280]  because, hey, we weren't asked about it, none of our legislators were asked about it.
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:12.280]  It was imposed by the European dictatorship and we all had to salute and obey and we had no say in the matter.
[02:10:12.280 --> 02:10:21.280]  Now, the great thing about the United States of America, and I'm speaking here in Washington, D.C., on tax day,
[02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:26.280]  is that the United States is different because it has a constitution.
[02:10:26.280 --> 02:10:32.280]  And the Constitution, at Article 1, Section 1 says this, it says,
[02:10:32.280 --> 02:10:43.280]  all legislative power here in granted shall be vested in the Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives, full point.
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:54.280]  Now, that means there is no dictatorship here for as long as the people of the United States are willing to keep themselves free.
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:11:02.280]  And that, I think, is the significance of the Tea Party movement, which came from nowhere, little over a year ago.
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:06.280]  The grassroots suddenly decided they were going to stand up and be counted.
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:14.280]  And I know that President Obama and the other world government wannabes are saying that this is astroterm that is paid for
[02:11:14.280 --> 02:11:21.280]  by fossil fuel industries or other wicked evil capitalists who want to keep the world free and prosperous.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:34.280]  But the fact is this is a stirring of popular opinions, such as has probably not been seen in the United States since that day in 1773,
[02:11:34.280 --> 02:11:41.280]  when your forefather decided to pour tea into Boston Harbor.
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:47.280]  Now, I've got a tip for you. Try pouring it into the tea pot next time. It tastes better that way.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:59.280]  Remember this also. The British Tea Tax was thousands of times cheaper than Obamacare and millions of times cheaper than what would happen to the United States
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:09.280]  if any part of the cap and tax regime now being wriggled and struggled through the Senate were actually to be passed.
[02:12:09.280 --> 02:12:17.280]  And Obama is separately saying he's going to have the EPA enforce it regardless. That is open tyranny.
[02:12:17.280 --> 02:12:26.280]  And Club of Rome behind eco-fascist purge decriminalized climate skepticism, an article at prisonplanet.com quoting Club of Rome members saying
[02:12:26.280 --> 02:12:31.280]  we should all be arrested if we criticize anthropogenic global warming.
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:40.280]  And they are openly saying arrest us. They've called for your arrest previously, when in truth they're the ones that have been caught committing this fraud
[02:12:40.280 --> 02:12:44.280]  and these crimes and you've called for Al Gore to be arrested.
[02:12:44.280 --> 02:12:50.280]  Yes, indeed. I think the real criminals who are, I call them the global warming profiteers.
[02:12:50.280 --> 02:12:58.280]  And in Al Gore's case, the racketeers, where he is now ignoring the order of a high court judge in the United Kingdom,
[02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:04.280]  11th, series, 9th, series there as I should say, in his mortgage sci-fi comedy horror movie,
[02:13:04.280 --> 02:13:11.280]  he deserves to go to jail for peddling a false prospectus in his investment management corporation,
[02:13:11.280 --> 02:13:19.280]  which is devoted to so-called green investments, all of which are of course collapsing as the world fails to warm up
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:27.280]  anything life as fast as the UN and its fellow travelers of the climate extremist movement have predicted.
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:35.280]  But this idea that we should be arrested simply for saying what we believe to be the scientific truth.
[02:13:35.280 --> 02:13:45.280]  That is the same sort of noise that Hitler and his supporters made in the early 1930s before Hitler was swept to power.
[02:13:45.280 --> 02:13:53.280]  The idea was that if everybody else could be silenced, then only one point of view would be allowed to be put.
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:14:00.280]  And that's what they're trying to do now. And why is this? It's actually not because they think they're going to get away with it.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:07.280]  It's because they think they're not going to get away with it. They are now becoming desperate.
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:15.280]  Opinion polls in those countries where there is still freedom via the ballot box to decide your policies,
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:23.280]  and that means not Britain, not the dismal European dictatorship, but it does mean Canada, it does mean Australia.
[02:14:23.280 --> 02:14:33.280]  Above all, it does mean the United States of America. In those countries, each new opinion says that people are believing
[02:14:33.280 --> 02:14:40.280]  less and less in this extremist nonsense coming up by the climate extremist. They no longer believe it.
[02:14:40.280 --> 02:14:46.280]  They're no longer prepared to vote for it. They're no longer prepared to pay for it. They do not want it.
[02:14:46.280 --> 02:14:56.280]  And the global warming profiteers are in desperation trying to call for the final solution to silence the likes of me
[02:14:56.280 --> 02:15:04.280]  who dare to raise elementary questions like the one I'm going to raise now, which is how much global warming
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:11.280]  will a given increase in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere caused? The answer in today's atmosphere
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:19.280]  we now know by measurement very, very, very little. It will cause some, but only about a quarter, a fifth,
[02:15:19.280 --> 02:15:29.280]  maybe even a seventh or a tenth of the UN's central estimate, and therefore that is harmless and tiny and beneficial.
[02:15:29.280 --> 02:15:37.280]  If we could double the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, the yield of some staple crops would go up by as much as 40%.
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:45.280]  CO2 is actually good for you. It's not harmful, but the reason why they want to stamp it out is that if they can pretend it's dangerous,
[02:15:45.280 --> 02:15:56.280]  it gives them the excuse to interfere and control every aspect of economic and political life and freedom in the nations of the West.
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:04.280]  And selectively, to anybody in your Congress who supports those points of view, this is what's going to happen to you.
[02:16:04.280 --> 02:16:07.280]  We will vote them out.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:15.280]  Absolutely. Here on that point, as you say they're getting desperate, we're gaining in an index of polls as much as two,
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:23.280]  three points per week. Just in the last few months the exposure of these criminals, these control freaks,
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:33.280]  trying to seize our society through false guilt and fear-mongering apocalyptic doom, is being exposed.
[02:16:33.280 --> 02:16:42.280]  But as you said, they're getting even more vicious. Everywhere Al Gore goes, he's now hounded about the Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets exploding in size.
[02:16:42.280 --> 02:16:49.280]  He's being hounded about 10 years of temperature going down, 15 of it slowing.
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:57.280]  Everywhere he goes, crowds are chasing him and trampling him basically politically down into the dirt.
[02:16:57.280 --> 02:17:01.280]  So how do you see them counter-striking?
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:06.280]  I think as far as Gore is concerned, he's a very sad, lonely figure now.
[02:17:06.280 --> 02:17:15.280]  He was the darling of the hour in 2007 when he got his Mickey Mouse Nobel Prize for Peace.
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:23.280]  He was the darling when he got his Mickey Mouse Oscar for the Best Sci-Fi Comedy Horror Movie.
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:33.280]  Everybody thought he was just a bee thief. Now that they've realized that just about everything he said is false from top to bottom,
[02:17:33.280 --> 02:17:42.280]  the British High Court saying that the Armageddon scenario that he depicted not based on any scientific view, he is now finished.
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:45.280]  Oh, well, of course, he's made a few hundred million in the meantime.
[02:17:45.280 --> 02:17:52.280]  So he'll be all right in his retirement, in his Tennessee mansion, which consumes 20 times as much electricity,
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:57.280]  and emits 20 times the carbon footprint of any average house in the United States.
[02:17:57.280 --> 02:18:01.280]  He's fine, but he's now an irrelevant.
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:09.280]  And I think the way we're going to take it back is starting with the tax day rallies all over the United States today,
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:20.280]  especially the one here in Washington. We are going to put those in Congress who have drifted along with this garbage on notice
[02:18:20.280 --> 02:18:29.280]  that if any of them ever again vote for anything to do with global warming, they will be slung out of office forever.
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:41.280]  In the present state of the US economy, where the debt from the year dot to the year 2004 was, I think, $4 trillion.
[02:18:41.280 --> 02:18:50.280]  It's now $14 trillion, and Obama has managed to add another $4 trillion in just the last six months.
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:19:00.280]  That kind of flagrant overspending, if he now proposes to increase that overspending still further with all this global warming rubbish,
[02:19:00.280 --> 02:19:07.280]  then I think the ordinary tax payer, the ordinary working guy who might have made the mistake of voting for what I am going to call
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:14.280]  what it is, a communist administration, will no longer vote for it or for Obama.
[02:19:14.280 --> 02:19:21.280]  Let's just look at the effect of these enormous tax-increasing measures on Obama's own standing.
[02:19:21.280 --> 02:19:24.280]  Well, stay there, Lord Monkton. We've got to go to break when we come back and we'll go over that.
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:30.280]  Then we'll talk about all the new scandals filling in other pieces of the puzzle clearly in 2020 vision,
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:39.280]  showing massive organized racketeering and what type of criminal action, what type of criminal charges need to be launched
[02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:47.280]  to bring these scallywags to justice. Scienceandpublicpolicy.org is the website of Lord Monkton.
[02:19:47.280 --> 02:19:51.280]  Excellent information there and invaluable research and education tool.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:53.280]  We'll put it up on screen during the break.
[02:19:53.280 --> 02:19:57.280]  You're at PrismPlanet.tv and for radio listeners, it's linked up on our websites.
[02:19:57.280 --> 02:20:10.280]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:34.280]  Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[02:20:34.280 --> 02:20:39.280]  Herb Kay was right. His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[02:20:39.280 --> 02:20:43.280]  What have you got to lose? Stop the calls now, get out of debt and have more money.
[02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:47.280]  Get Herb Kay's number one death secret absolutely free now.
[02:20:47.280 --> 02:20:56.280]  Call 800-822-1291. That's 800-822-1291.
[02:20:56.280 --> 02:21:00.280]  800-822-1291.
[02:21:00.280 --> 02:21:07.280]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:21:07.280 --> 02:21:12.280]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical,
[02:21:12.280 --> 02:21:15.280]  many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:21:15.280 --> 02:21:21.280]  Is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt,
[02:21:21.280 --> 02:21:23.280]  ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:28.280]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:21:28.280 --> 02:21:33.280]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:21:33.280 --> 02:21:38.280]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:43.280]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[02:21:43.280 --> 02:21:48.280]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[02:21:48.280 --> 02:21:51.280]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[02:21:51.280 --> 02:22:00.280]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:00.280 --> 02:22:02.280]  They helped to create a new world order.
[02:22:02.280 --> 02:22:05.280]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:08.280]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:22:08.280 --> 02:22:13.280]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:18.280]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:20.280]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:22:20.280 --> 02:22:26.280]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:34.280]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:22:34.280 --> 02:22:39.280]  We believe, first of all, that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:22:39.280 --> 02:22:42.280]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:48.280]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[02:22:48.280 --> 02:22:54.280]  Invisible Empire. Secure your copy today at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com.

[02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:01.280]  Spring is here. Growing season.
[02:23:01.280 --> 02:23:05.280]  The economy is not getting any better. In fact, it's getting worse.
[02:23:05.280 --> 02:23:10.280]  Think about it. At this rate, how will your life be in a month or even a year?
[02:23:10.280 --> 02:23:14.280]  Maybe you've been putting things off, but the time to act is now.
[02:23:14.280 --> 02:23:19.280]  The country is running out of food. You need to get your seeds before it's too late.

[02:24:03.280 --> 02:24:14.280]  The establishment. The greenies love to sit up there like their god and tell us how guilty and evil we are for having cars and homes and swimming pools and factories.
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:19.280]  Meanwhile, they use these laws to shut down our factories and move them to China and India.
[02:24:19.280 --> 02:24:26.280]  They know exactly what they're doing, and they must be fully routed. This cancer cannot be left anywhere.
[02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:31.280]  And they've committed such incredible crimes. They've reached for the world through this green tyranny.
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:39.280]  Lord Monkton, do you agree with me that we can't just discredit them? They've committed crimes. They must be brought to justice.
[02:24:39.280 --> 02:24:50.280]  That, I think, is the fairest thing to do with people who have terrified children in schools, lied and lied and lied again in official publications,
[02:24:50.280 --> 02:24:56.280]  invented a threat where one doesn't exist, magnified it where one might exist,
[02:24:56.280 --> 02:25:05.280]  and generally worked the world up into a fervour of terror over what turns out to be a complete non-problem.
[02:25:05.280 --> 02:25:09.280]  And how do we know it is a non-problem? Well, we know it by measurement.
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:19.280]  The UN and its fellow travelers in the climate extremist green movement have been using what are called computer models to make their predictions.
[02:25:19.280 --> 02:25:28.280]  Now, these are essentially a whole lot of zitty teenagers sitting in dark rooms with too many bagels and burgers, picking their zits,
[02:25:28.280 --> 02:25:33.280]  picking their noses, pecking at the keyboards and making stuff up.
[02:25:33.280 --> 02:25:36.280]  That's how the UN does the science of climate.
[02:25:36.280 --> 02:25:46.280]  But the real way to do the science of climate, like any other science, is not by modeling, which is the only limited use and should never be used as the primary tool,
[02:25:46.280 --> 02:25:51.280]  but by measurement. If I took my tie off and said, how long is this tie?
[02:25:51.280 --> 02:25:57.280]  You could ring round all the manufacturers and you could say, how long are the ties you make? How many of them do you sell?
[02:25:57.280 --> 02:26:05.280]  You could put that into a computer model and make a guess, which would probably be wrong. Or you could say, give me your tie and a tape measure and I will measure it.
[02:26:05.280 --> 02:26:11.280]  Which is going to give you the more reliable measurement. Of course, the measurement is. That's going to give you the answer.
[02:26:11.280 --> 02:26:22.280]  And by measurement, it has been established over and over and over again in the last few years, with papers coming out as recently as just a couple of months ago,
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:33.280]  showing that the outgoing radiation that is supposed to be being trapped down here in the Earth's atmosphere is escaping out to space very much as it always did.
[02:26:33.280 --> 02:26:43.280]  That means it's not staying down here to cause warming. That means the warming effect of CO2, though it is not non-existent, is very small, harmless and beneficial.
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:52.280]  And we know the earth has actually been getting colder and that they hid that decline in premeditated fraud.
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:27:06.280]  Well, I think they were very naughty. What they were trying to do in that particular email from the Climate Gate emails that are exchanged between the leading mad scientists of the world who have been stirring up this scare,
[02:27:06.280 --> 02:27:17.280]  is they were trying to hide the fact that although temperatures were shown to be going up in the real world by measurement,
[02:27:17.280 --> 02:27:38.280]  the proxy, the so-called Bristlecone kind of pine, the proxy they were using to try and reconstruct past temperatures, when they came to try and reconstruct the temperatures at the present time, appeared to show that temperatures should have been falling.
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:50.280]  And so they did in that brief period where we had a real temperature record to check it against that showed that the record of past temperatures where we didn't have instruments was entirely unreliable.
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:58.280]  It was that that they were trying to conceal and they were trying to conceal it deliberately. It was clearly intended to be dishonest.
[02:27:58.280 --> 02:28:09.280]  An extraordinary thing is that first the House of Commons, then the University of East Anglia, whitewashed it the way and said that nothing incorrect, nothing wrong had been done.
[02:28:09.280 --> 02:28:21.280]  Here are scientists lying to each other and to us in the hope of persuading us to spend trillions upon trillions in shutting down the economies of the West.
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:39.280]  Notice that you don't hear these green campaigners saying that China should clean up its filthy, polluting coal-fired power stations where they haven't bothered to put the fly ash trappers and they haven't put the new circulating fluidised bed techniques into the combustion chambers.
[02:28:39.280 --> 02:28:46.280]  All of these things they need to modernise, they can well afford to modernise it but they don't do it because they don't care about the pollution they're causing.
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:56.280]  Do the greenies campaign about where the real pollution is going on in China, in India, in Indonesia, in Russia, in Brazil, in South Africa? Do they heck?
[02:28:56.280 --> 02:29:11.280]  Their intention is to close down the countries of the world which are the environmentally cleanest because these are not environmentalists, they are communist and their aim is to destroy the West.
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:22.280]  And they've said that, I mean we've got the head climatologist at NASA, we've got Maury Strong, we've got Ted Turner saying we must destroy industrialised society but only in the West.
[02:29:22.280 --> 02:29:30.280]  I mean a crime against humanity and of course you go over the numbers of how many people will die in the third world under the carbon regime that was in the Copenhagen Treaty.
[02:29:30.280 --> 02:29:35.280]  We'll talk about that plus all the new scandals that have come out.
[02:29:35.280 --> 02:29:41.280]  We'll talk about the stuff from a month ago with the Himalayas where they used a photography students report, the claim they were melting.
[02:29:41.280 --> 02:29:45.280]  Now I'm talking about all the new stunning information coming out.
[02:29:45.280 --> 02:29:50.280]  Straight ahead with Lord Christopher Monckton, long segment coming up, stay with us.
[02:29:50.280 --> 02:30:00.280]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.280 --> 02:30:08.280]  They helped to create a new world order. We are part of a new world order, a new world order based upon collective action.
[02:30:08.280 --> 02:30:13.280]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:30:13.280 --> 02:30:18.280]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:20.280]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:30:20.280 --> 02:30:26.280]  The United Nations would take over America, the Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:34.280]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:30:34.280 --> 02:30:39.280]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:30:39.280 --> 02:30:42.280]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:30:42.280 --> 02:30:46.280]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:48.280]  And I got news for you. You're everyone else.
[02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:50.280]  Invisible Empire.

[02:31:23.280 --> 02:31:30.280]  They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[02:31:30.280 --> 02:31:38.280]  And here's the best part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.

[02:31:48.280 --> 02:31:57.280]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[02:31:57.280 --> 02:32:00.280]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[02:32:00.280 --> 02:32:05.280]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[02:32:05.280 --> 02:32:08.280]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world.
[02:32:08.280 --> 02:32:13.280]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:18.280]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from infowars.com.

[02:32:58.280 --> 02:33:13.280]  We're going to take a few calls for Lord Christopher Monkton. Your questions for him, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:33:13.280 --> 02:33:15.280]  Don't forget coming up at an hour and a half.
[02:33:15.280 --> 02:33:20.280]  We're premiering the new film, Invisible Empire, in order to find, exposing these criminals.
[02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:23.280]  Jason Burmese's new film, premiering at prisonplanet.tv.
[02:33:23.280 --> 02:33:26.280]  You can order the DVD at infowars.com.
[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:29.280]  They're now shipping next week. Police State Four comes out on Wednesday.
[02:33:29.280 --> 02:33:31.280]  You can pre-order that now.
[02:33:31.280 --> 02:33:34.280]  Lord Monkton, so much to go over here.
[02:33:34.280 --> 02:33:37.280]  I can't even keep track of it. Every day a new scandal.
[02:33:37.280 --> 02:33:41.280]  Every day it's proven that all their science is fraud, premeditatedly.
[02:33:41.280 --> 02:33:43.280]  And then this one, Financial Times of London.
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:46.280]  Global warming graph attacked by study.
[02:33:46.280 --> 02:33:52.280]  A key piece of evidence climate change science was slammed as exaggerated on Wednesday by UK's leading statistician
[02:33:52.280 --> 02:33:56.280]  in a vindication of claims that global warming skeptics have made for years.
[02:33:56.280 --> 02:34:00.280]  Namely Lord Monkton, who first exposed the hockey stick.
[02:34:00.280 --> 02:34:04.280]  And now we know that man has been involved with Jones and others at the core group
[02:34:04.280 --> 02:34:08.280]  engaging in this, what can only be called, racketeering.
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:13.280]  So let's go over this and the countless other scandals that have come out.
[02:34:13.280 --> 02:34:17.280]  Because it's positive this is all coming out, but it's almost like they're coming out too quick.
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:21.280]  We don't have time to take each one and get it out to the public.
[02:34:21.280 --> 02:34:27.280]  It is quite extraordinary how in the last few months since the climate gate emails were first revealed
[02:34:27.280 --> 02:34:30.280]  there's been a kind of breaking of the logjam.
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:36.280]  And scientists who for years have been wanting to write papers saying what nonsense it is
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:40.280]  are now finding the courage to do so.
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:45.280]  It's very interesting and this statistical report from the UK is very significant
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:54.280]  and the UK has been the most true believing of all the sappy world governments on this issue.
[02:34:54.280 --> 02:35:03.280]  And so much so that in 1904 when the Russians under Vladimir Putin wanted to get a briefing
[02:35:03.280 --> 02:35:08.280]  for their Academy of Sciences on the global warming scare
[02:35:08.280 --> 02:35:13.280]  it was the British government they asked to send a delegation to do the briefing.
[02:35:13.280 --> 02:35:15.280]  They went across with those people.
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:22.280]  However, Dr Ilarionov of the Russian Academy of Sciences who is a formidable mind
[02:35:22.280 --> 02:35:26.280]  is also very careful and he got together half a dozen skeptics.
[02:35:26.280 --> 02:35:29.280]  One of them told the story of what happened.
[02:35:29.280 --> 02:35:36.280]  So David King began coming out with the usual string of lies about how the climate was doomed, etc.
[02:35:36.280 --> 02:35:39.280]  Fact after fact was simply incorrect.
[02:35:39.280 --> 02:35:44.280]  Eventually Professor Paul Reiter who was one of those who has been invited, the world expert on malaria
[02:35:44.280 --> 02:35:49.280]  who says that global warming will not affect the spread of malaria pretty much at all.
[02:35:49.280 --> 02:35:54.280]  He went along and he said it's no good that David King, these facts are simply not right
[02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:56.280]  and he began challenging David King.
[02:35:56.280 --> 02:35:58.280]  In fact David King was furious.
[02:35:58.280 --> 02:36:01.280]  He had never faced such a challenge before.
[02:36:01.280 --> 02:36:08.280]  He stormed out of the meeting taking the British delegation with him, leaving the field entirely clear for the skeptics
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:14.280]  who then gave a marvelous, thorough, comprehensive briefing to Dr Ilarionov
[02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:19.280]  who in summing up that meeting in just three pages of text
[02:36:19.280 --> 02:36:24.280]  gives one of the best summaries of why global warming is not and could never be a global crisis
[02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:28.280]  that any National Academy of Sciences has ever delivered.
[02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:30.280]  But here's what happened next.
[02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:38.280]  Tony Blair met Vladimir Putin at one of these endless world government summaries of the G8 or the G20 or the G77
[02:36:38.280 --> 02:36:41.280]  or whichever piece of arithmetic he liked.
[02:36:41.280 --> 02:36:43.280]  And he said, look, let's do a deal.
[02:36:43.280 --> 02:36:50.280]  If you agree to say that global warming is terrible and shut up your Academy of Sciences
[02:36:50.280 --> 02:36:53.280]  get it to say the opposite of what it believes to be true.
[02:36:53.280 --> 02:36:58.280]  I will let you into the World Trade Organization with most favored nation status.
[02:36:58.280 --> 02:37:00.280]  That's what goes on.
[02:37:00.280 --> 02:37:02.280]  There's no truth behind any of this.
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:09.280]  And as you're quite right, it's now very, very difficult to keep up with the endless tide of information
[02:37:09.280 --> 02:37:14.280]  about how it's the sun and it's the sea and it's the cloud
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:20.280]  and as we're about to discover from Iceland, it's also volcano that really dominates the climate.
[02:37:20.280 --> 02:37:22.280]  Let me raise that. Let me raise that.
[02:37:22.280 --> 02:37:24.280]  I have a Twitter question for you.
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:32.280]  It says, Lord Moncton, are they aware that the volcanic eruption in Iceland will decrease global temperatures?
[02:37:32.280 --> 02:37:36.280]  Yes, they are aware of that because they know that if you get a really big eruption
[02:37:36.280 --> 02:37:40.280]  and it looks as though this one may come into that category slightly early days.
[02:37:40.280 --> 02:37:45.280]  Yeah, but if it carries on for a day or two more as it is, then yes, it will be a big one.
[02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:48.280]  Then that throws so much volcanic ash up.
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:51.280]  As you know, it's shut down the whole of Europe and the Atlantic
[02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:54.280]  and all flight flights in Britain are already grounded.
[02:37:54.280 --> 02:37:59.280]  Though curiously, Reykjavik Airport, which is upwind of this, is still free for traffic.
[02:37:59.280 --> 02:38:04.280]  But when you get enough of that volcanic ash getting up into the atmosphere,
[02:38:04.280 --> 02:38:10.280]  it stops the sunlight reaching the ground and that causes global cooling
[02:38:10.280 --> 02:38:13.280]  of around half a degree, sometimes even one degree Celsius,
[02:38:13.280 --> 02:38:18.280]  but only for six months to a year because eventually, of course, the rain comes
[02:38:18.280 --> 02:38:21.280]  and the ash, which is heavier than the air, gradually falls back to the ground
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:26.280]  and provides very nice fertilizer for everybody's soil, does no harm.
[02:38:26.280 --> 02:38:30.280]  And then the sunlight can get through much as usual again.
[02:38:30.280 --> 02:38:37.280]  However, what we did notice after the last really big eruption, which was in Cuba in 1991,
[02:38:37.280 --> 02:38:43.280]  what then happened was that there was a temporary reduction in cloud cover
[02:38:43.280 --> 02:38:47.280]  following the year after that eruption and persisting for about a decade.
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:51.280]  And that, of course, caused an enormous increase in global temperature.
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:56.280]  So we may paradoxically, as a result of this eruption, see a similar reduction in cloud cover
[02:38:56.280 --> 02:39:01.280]  and get cover again and that will cause a temporary global warming that could be quite rapid.
[02:39:01.280 --> 02:39:05.280]  And of course, this will allow the other side to blame it all on CO2.
[02:39:05.280 --> 02:39:09.280]  But Lord Moncton, hold on. Couldn't we just pay Al Gore a couple billion
[02:39:09.280 --> 02:39:15.280]  and he would give us an indulgence and wave a magic wand and make the volcanoes not erupt?
[02:39:15.280 --> 02:39:22.280]  Because, I mean, after all, Danny Glover and then a UN official said that the earthquake in Haiti
[02:39:22.280 --> 02:39:28.280]  was caused by global warming and now they're claiming the Chilean earthquake was caught.
[02:39:28.280 --> 02:39:32.280]  But so if we just pay them some money, will they stop the earthquakes?
[02:39:32.280 --> 02:39:36.280]  Oh, just like that, yes. Al Gore has only to stretch out his hand
[02:39:36.280 --> 02:39:39.280]  and the entire world will stop spinning around. We'll all fly off.
[02:39:39.280 --> 02:39:45.280]  No, I mean, of course, it's ridiculous. One knows perfectly well that global warming cannot
[02:39:45.280 --> 02:39:50.280]  possibly cause or have any connection with earthquakes.
[02:39:50.280 --> 02:39:56.280]  They are driven by a completely separate mechanism a long way below the Earth's surface,
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:59.280]  wholly disconnected from the climate above.
[02:39:59.280 --> 02:40:02.280]  And it is simple rubbish to try to suggest otherwise.
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:08.280]  Of course, you've noticed in the fashion now that every kind of weather that is happening,
[02:40:08.280 --> 02:40:12.280]  you've just had the coldest winter on record in most of North America
[02:40:12.280 --> 02:40:15.280]  and, of course, the warmest came straight out, the climate extended.
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:18.280]  Oh, yes, that's what we would expect from global warming.
[02:40:18.280 --> 02:40:21.280]  So here's the thing. We expect earthquakes from global warming.
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:25.280]  We expect warming from global warming. We expect cooling from global warming.
[02:40:25.280 --> 02:40:28.280]  We expect floods from global warming. We expect droughts from global warming.
[02:40:28.280 --> 02:40:34.280]  Hang on a moment. All we're really saying is that whichever direction the climate changes in,
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:37.280]  they're going to blame it on global warming.
[02:40:37.280 --> 02:40:42.280]  So at this point, Lord Moncton interrupted because we've got limited time
[02:40:42.280 --> 02:40:46.280]  and these facts are so key, we know they've been caught in fraud.
[02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:49.280]  We know they haven't agenda to control our lives and become kings of us.
[02:40:49.280 --> 02:40:53.280]  We understand that. And the general public's beginning to understand that.
[02:40:53.280 --> 02:40:57.280]  But for me, going back years, it's just the asinine level.
[02:40:57.280 --> 02:41:02.280]  I can go look up the federal government numbers on polar bears
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:07.280]  and they've gone from roughly 22,000 30 years ago in our area of the world
[02:41:07.280 --> 02:41:10.280]  in North America to over 50,000.
[02:41:10.280 --> 02:41:14.280]  And so when Al Gore says the polar bears are all dying, we know it's a lie.
[02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:18.280]  When they say in the Arctic, penguins are dying because they're drowning.
[02:41:18.280 --> 02:41:22.280]  We know they're an aquatic bird. I mean, the level of asinine line,
[02:41:22.280 --> 02:41:25.280]  but the one I want you to talk about now because we're showing video of this,
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:29.280]  both the 20-year time lapse and then this year's time lapse from satellites,
[02:41:29.280 --> 02:41:34.280]  we know the Arctic expanded. And this is admitted by the greatest level
[02:41:34.280 --> 02:41:37.280]  in the last 30 years. That's admitted by NASA.
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:42.280]  And I'm showing a NASA satellite composite right now of it growing this year.
[02:41:42.280 --> 02:41:47.280]  And then I've seen the environmental phonies on the news saying it's not true
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:52.280]  that the ice caps are melting. I mean, they are denying that the sun comes up in the morning.
[02:41:52.280 --> 02:41:55.280]  They are outrageous liars.
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:42:02.280]  It's extraordinary that on the polar bears, for instance, there were only 5,000 worldwide in the 1940s.
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:07.280]  Now, depending on which survey you read, there are 25,000 worldwide.
[02:42:07.280 --> 02:42:11.280]  And you've seen one that says there are 50,000 just in North America.
[02:42:11.280 --> 02:42:16.280]  The fact is that that's not the profile of a species in imminent set of extinction, is it?
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:22.280]  Likewise, the penguins. And of course, in the Antarctic, the sea ice has actually been growing for 30 years.
[02:42:22.280 --> 02:42:26.280]  Well, I was talking to one of these true believing scientists about that the other day, and he said,
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:34.280]  oh yes, but that's caused by catabatic winds coming down off the Antarctic ice cap and freezing the sea.
[02:42:34.280 --> 02:42:40.280]  And of course, yes, it is because the Antarctic has been getting cooler over the last 30 years,
[02:42:40.280 --> 02:42:45.280]  as the records very plainly show. So you won't see that reported in the mainstream.
[02:42:45.280 --> 02:42:47.280]  But that's what I'm saying, Lord Monty.
[02:42:47.280 --> 02:42:52.280]  It's the boldness. I've never seen total contempt for the public,
[02:42:52.280 --> 02:42:55.280]  and I guess some of the public really are dumb as a box of rocks,
[02:42:55.280 --> 02:43:01.280]  to tell them the Arctic and Antarctic are in danger of completely melting within the next five years,
[02:43:01.280 --> 02:43:04.280]  as Al Gore was just saying a few months ago at Copenhagen.
[02:43:04.280 --> 02:43:12.280]  I mean, it is an asinine fraud to tell schoolchildren that it's all melting when they know good and well it's getting bigger.
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:21.280]  Well, just to tend to go to the Arctic and give you the latest figures, the beginning of the spring ice melt in the Arctic
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:27.280]  began later this year than at any time since records began.
[02:43:27.280 --> 02:43:32.280]  That's the truth of the matter, because there's an awful lot of ice up there just now,
[02:43:32.280 --> 02:43:36.280]  and it will go back to more or less normal in the next few weeks, just as it always does.
[02:43:36.280 --> 02:43:41.280]  Then we'll see how it is in the summer, which will depend partly on the volcanic activity in Iceland, obviously.
[02:43:41.280 --> 02:43:45.280]  These things come and go, they're perfectly natural swings and roundabouts,
[02:43:45.280 --> 02:43:50.280]  but we know perfectly well that even if we were to lose a lot of ice in the Arctic,
[02:43:50.280 --> 02:43:57.280]  we've gained just as much in the Antarctic so that global sea ice has shown virtually no trend whatsoever.
[02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:02.280]  Over the last 30 years since the satellites first began to record it reliably,
[02:44:02.280 --> 02:44:09.280]  so whatever else is going on, it isn't global warming that's causing a little bit of melting that did happen in the Arctic
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:17.280]  just for a few weeks, only in the summer of 2007, but very nearly all of that summer minimum ice was restored in 2008
[02:44:17.280 --> 02:44:21.280]  and still more again in 2009. Those are the facts.
[02:44:21.280 --> 02:44:27.280]  Well, I know you challenged them on their phony science, but just the general propaganda that's given to the public,
[02:44:27.280 --> 02:44:34.280]  it's very elementary. They point a camera on every news show during the spring and summer
[02:44:34.280 --> 02:44:39.280]  at a glacier that's being built up by rain and snow during the winter and fall, fall and winter.
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:46.280]  They show the glaciers collapsing, ice flows and icebergs that have always done this since we had ice caps,
[02:44:46.280 --> 02:44:53.280]  and they say, look, it's melting. I mean, even the reporters have to know they're involved in a premeditated fraud,
[02:44:53.280 --> 02:44:58.280]  or are these reporters, for lack of a better term, mentally retarded?
[02:44:58.280 --> 02:45:04.280]  It's even more of a fraud than you think because the most frequently shown picture of a large chunk of,
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:13.280]  supposedly, Greenland glacial ice falling off into the sea is in fact taken from a glacier in South America,
[02:45:13.280 --> 02:45:18.280]  which is a land-based glacier where it crosses a lake. It looks like a sea, but actually it isn't.
[02:45:18.280 --> 02:45:24.280]  And every five years, this glacier goes right across the lake and dams the lake, the water behind the lake,
[02:45:24.280 --> 02:45:29.280]  which then builds up and bursts through, causing enormous chunks of ice to come off.
[02:45:29.280 --> 02:45:37.280]  What's interesting is that because there's been regional cooling over the last 30 years in that part of South America as well,
[02:45:37.280 --> 02:45:43.280]  that glacier that used to burst apart every five years is now bursting apart every two years,
[02:45:43.280 --> 02:45:46.280]  because there's more and more ice coming across and blocking the lake.
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:55.280]  So that in itself is another spectacular lie, and to name another one of that kind, when Al Gore shows a picture flying over
[02:45:55.280 --> 02:46:02.280]  what is supposed to be the melting Arctic ice, it is in fact a computer simulation and not the real thing.
[02:46:02.280 --> 02:46:10.280]  So everything that you're being shown, everything that you're being told about the supposed effect of supposed global warming
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:17.280]  is bogus, and even if it weren't bogus, the fact is we've had 300 years of global warming.
[02:46:17.280 --> 02:46:23.280]  It began, we could date it exactly thanks to the Central England Temperature Record, which is the earliest instrumental record in the world.
[02:46:23.280 --> 02:46:31.280]  It began in 1695, and in the next 40 years, the temperatures rose by four Fahrenheit degrees.
[02:46:31.280 --> 02:46:39.280]  That's one Fahrenheit degree for every decade. It's not done that since, because in the whole of the 20th century,
[02:46:39.280 --> 02:46:47.280]  it only rose by one Fahrenheit degree. So the idea that somehow the increase in temperatures over the 20th century is something new,
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:54.280]  the idea that it was an unprecedented rate, is simply nonsense, and we know from the records we have going back 300 years
[02:46:54.280 --> 02:47:01.280]  that it is obvious and errant nonsense, and yet this is the kind of rubbish they go on peddling.
[02:47:01.280 --> 02:47:10.280]  They say, for instance, that the warming since 1950 can only be explained if you assume that CO2 was the major cause.
[02:47:10.280 --> 02:47:18.280]  Nope, that's not correct. All of the warming, and I mean all the warming since 1950, can be explained by the temporary
[02:47:18.280 --> 02:47:27.280]  and naturally occurring reduction in cloud cover that happened between 1983 and 2001 when we had satellites up there to watch it.
[02:47:27.280 --> 02:47:35.280]  That blows into Smithereens, the principle conclusion of the UN's most recent climate report in 2007,
[02:47:35.280 --> 02:47:39.280]  where they said that we were responsible for most of the warming since 1950.
[02:47:39.280 --> 02:47:45.280]  That is simply a straight line, and they knew it because they actually cited the paper in which it was revealed
[02:47:45.280 --> 02:47:53.280]  just how much extra sunshine had hit the Earth between 1983 and 2001 as a result of that reduction in cloud cover.
[02:47:53.280 --> 02:47:59.280]  And finally, sir, to simplify this for some people out there who may not be following us,
[02:47:59.280 --> 02:48:04.280]  they're now moving away from seeing global warming because that's been exposed as a fraud to climate change
[02:48:04.280 --> 02:48:09.280]  and saying stabilizing our climate as if we're not supposed to have seasons.
[02:48:09.280 --> 02:48:14.280]  I mean, if they had their way in 100 years, they'll have children cowering under their beds at night
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:21.280]  and saying, mommy, the conspiracy theorist down the road is saying that we've always had seasons,
[02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:29.280]  but the government says that seasons are unnatural and we've got to pay all these taxes to try to battle changes in temperature.
[02:48:29.280 --> 02:48:35.280]  I think that's a great point. I think the fact is that the change in temperature in any one region of the planet
[02:48:35.280 --> 02:48:40.280]  between the summer and the winter is something like 20 times what's going to happen
[02:48:40.280 --> 02:48:44.280]  even if we get a little bit of global warming over the next 100 years, which we may,
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:49.280]  but it's going to be so small and so insignificant that it's not going to do any harm to anyone.
[02:48:49.280 --> 02:48:54.280]  And that's really the simple bottom line. I'm sorry if that last answer sounded a little bit too complicated,
[02:48:54.280 --> 02:49:01.280]  but it's really quite simple. If you get a naturally occurring reduction in cloud cover, fewer clouds between the sun and the ground,
[02:49:01.280 --> 02:49:06.280]  more sunlight hits the ground and the ground gets warmer and it gets warmer naturally
[02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:09.280]  and nothing what ever to do with CO2. It's really as simple as that.
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:14.280]  And we can do a simple calculation based on that to work out what the warming effect of CO2
[02:49:14.280 --> 02:49:19.280]  over those 18 years from 1983 to 2001 could possibly have been. And the answer is
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:22.280]  there's virtually no room for it to have had any influence at all.
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:28.280]  And of course, since the end of 2001, we've had rapid significant global cooling anyway.
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:32.280]  Lord Moncton, I'm going to skip this final break. We've only got 10 minutes left with you.
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:35.280]  Again, you're always extremely gracious to give us so much time.
[02:49:35.280 --> 02:49:39.280]  I know you're in demand globally, but that's another indicator of the good news
[02:49:39.280 --> 02:49:44.280]  is that you were wanted in front of crowds of tens of thousands in television and radio and TV
[02:49:44.280 --> 02:49:49.280]  24 hours a day, more than you could ever do, and we're appreciative of your great stamina
[02:49:49.280 --> 02:49:54.280]  that can only liken to Ron Paul and the amount of stamina I've seen that he's had
[02:49:54.280 --> 02:49:57.280]  out there fighting many other forms and permutations of tyranny.
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:02.280]  But I want to take some final calls here. And I wasn't being patronizing, saying,
[02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:08.280]  please simplify it. I just wanted to boil down for people just how elementary this is.
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:12.280]  I mean, I don't claim to be that smart. And this has been blaringly clear to me
[02:50:12.280 --> 02:50:16.280]  just because I understood history. I mean, I've read history about sometimes in Europe
[02:50:16.280 --> 02:50:20.280]  it'd be freezing for 100 years and sometimes for 200 years it'd be super hot.
[02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:23.280]  And it's in the Chinese history. It's in all the histories.
[02:50:23.280 --> 02:50:27.280]  And we just know this is a fraud. We know that we had the Bronze Age
[02:50:27.280 --> 02:50:31.280]  because temperature went up over 10 degrees, much warmer than the last, you know,
[02:50:31.280 --> 02:50:35.280]  warming period we've seen the last 50 years. And it's just so ridiculous.
[02:50:35.280 --> 02:50:40.280]  Let's talk to MD in Maine. You're on the air with Lord Christopher Monkton.
[02:50:40.280 --> 02:50:44.280]  His website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org. Go ahead.
[02:50:44.280 --> 02:50:49.280]  Yes, Lord Monkton. Welcome to America. And this is a question for you and Alex
[02:50:49.280 --> 02:50:54.280]  on a financial question. Specifically, we know that the pension funds in America
[02:50:54.280 --> 02:51:00.280]  are being targeted by the government as a way to back up the treasuries.
[02:51:00.280 --> 02:51:06.280]  But my specific question is 401Ks and IRAs. Are those on the radar screen as well
[02:51:06.280 --> 02:51:09.280]  and will those be targeted? And if so, how soon would that happen?
[02:51:09.280 --> 02:51:13.280]  MD, MD, specifically, I'm now reminded Lord Monkton going into break
[02:51:13.280 --> 02:51:17.280]  tried to get into the financial ruination that we're seeing through
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:21.280]  the Obama collectivist takeover. And yes, it is in Bloomberg.
[02:51:21.280 --> 02:51:24.280]  They're looking at taking your pension funds. Lord Monkton.
[02:51:24.280 --> 02:51:31.280]  Yes, I think you've got to realize that so bankrupt is America now at the federal level.
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:38.280]  And so wicked is the sheer scale on which the present administration has ramped up
[02:51:38.280 --> 02:51:43.280]  spending artificially in the short term so as to make our children, our children's
[02:51:43.280 --> 02:51:48.280]  children and their children in turn pay for the self-indulgence of this.
[02:51:48.280 --> 02:51:51.280]  And I'm going to call it again what it is, a communist administration.
[02:51:51.280 --> 02:51:57.280]  But yes, you are going to find that every penny that you've got, which isn't hidden
[02:51:57.280 --> 02:52:02.280]  under the mattress, any penny that you've got that they can find, they're going to come after it.
[02:52:02.280 --> 02:52:06.280]  Your pensions are not going to be safe under this administration.
[02:52:06.280 --> 02:52:12.280]  Anyone who has had the providence and the thrift to save for his or her old age
[02:52:12.280 --> 02:52:16.280]  is going to find the sticky-fingered government coming in there and at first
[02:52:16.280 --> 02:52:21.280]  increasing the taxes on it and then arbitrarily confiscating it all together
[02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:26.280]  and saying, as they did with healthcare, we in the federal government are going to provide
[02:52:26.280 --> 02:52:31.280]  your pensions and in order to do that, we want you to hand over all your pension money.
[02:52:31.280 --> 02:52:36.280]  There is a real danger that an administration as wild and as fiscally irresponsible
[02:52:36.280 --> 02:52:42.280]  and as monetarily incompetent as this one and as malevolent towards the American people
[02:52:42.280 --> 02:52:47.280]  as this one has shown itself repeatedly to be will indeed come after your pension.
[02:52:47.280 --> 02:52:50.280]  Nothing and no one is safe.
[02:52:50.280 --> 02:52:55.280]  And my three magic words I repeat again, vote them out.
[02:52:55.280 --> 02:52:57.280]  And you were trying to talk about healthcare earlier.
[02:52:57.280 --> 02:53:02.280]  I do want to take a few more calls, but specifically, you're in England with the National Health Service.
[02:53:02.280 --> 02:53:06.280]  The VA runs healthcare here for veterans, the worst healthcare in the world
[02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:08.280]  when government has a hand in it.
[02:53:08.280 --> 02:53:11.280]  In 60 seconds, you're a breakdown on government-run healthcare.
[02:53:11.280 --> 02:53:14.280]  Just don't go there is the short answer.
[02:53:14.280 --> 02:53:16.280]  It's been an enormous failure in Britain.
[02:53:16.280 --> 02:53:19.280]  It was supposed to be the envy of the world.
[02:53:19.280 --> 02:53:23.280]  Absolutely nobody has copied the way the British does it until now.
[02:53:23.280 --> 02:53:25.280]  And now here we have Obamacare.
[02:53:25.280 --> 02:53:29.280]  He didn't get away with the public option or option full blown.
[02:53:29.280 --> 02:53:34.280]  What he's done instead is to defer to the huge companies and corporations that run healthcare
[02:53:34.280 --> 02:53:38.280]  and make sure that they are going to make vastly increased profit
[02:53:38.280 --> 02:53:44.280]  by forcing people into paying for healthcare via state-run exchanges.
[02:53:44.280 --> 02:53:48.280]  The whole mess is going to be a bureaucratic nightmare.
[02:53:48.280 --> 02:53:49.280]  It's going to cost a fortune.
[02:53:49.280 --> 02:53:51.280]  Healthcare standards will plummet.
[02:53:51.280 --> 02:53:54.280]  And already I know of several of your leading doctors
[02:53:54.280 --> 02:53:57.280]  who are simply going to upstix and get out.
[02:53:57.280 --> 02:54:04.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, you just heard intense veritas.
[02:54:04.280 --> 02:54:10.280]  The truth, this is global corporations, big healthcare coming in and robbing you.
[02:54:10.280 --> 02:54:12.280]  Government keeps half of it.
[02:54:12.280 --> 02:54:13.280]  Corporations keep the other.
[02:54:13.280 --> 02:54:14.280]  They lower your standard of care.
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:16.280]  Well said, Lord Monkton.
[02:54:16.280 --> 02:54:18.280]  Let's talk to Brian in California.
[02:54:18.280 --> 02:54:19.280]  You're on the air.
[02:54:19.280 --> 02:54:20.280]  Hello, Alex.
[02:54:20.280 --> 02:54:26.280]  I'm here with my sweet and lovable wife who's a major contributor.
[02:54:26.280 --> 02:54:33.280]  I made an observation sometime ago that the signing of the Federal Reserve Act
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:39.280]  was exactly to the day, 99 years after the signing of the Treaty of Gent.
[02:54:39.280 --> 02:54:44.280]  Now, if you take exactly 99 years to the day after the Federal Reserve Act,
[02:54:44.280 --> 02:54:47.280]  you can land on the 2012 Doomsday.
[02:54:47.280 --> 02:54:49.280]  My question to you, Lord Monkton.
[02:54:49.280 --> 02:54:52.280]  That's another numerological subject I don't really get into,
[02:54:52.280 --> 02:54:54.280]  but we're taking questions for Lord Monkton.
[02:54:54.280 --> 02:54:55.280]  Thank you.
[02:54:55.280 --> 02:54:57.280]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[02:54:57.280 --> 02:55:00.280]  Lord Monkton, I want to ask you a question for Alex.
[02:55:00.280 --> 02:55:03.280]  I'm not sure he doesn't want to bother to ask you,
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:06.280]  but he's been attacked by a number of people in the press,
[02:55:06.280 --> 02:55:08.280]  and some of these press reached England,
[02:55:08.280 --> 02:55:13.280]  and you know that the system in England would clip these birds' wings pretty quickly,
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:18.280]  especially when they're saying he's threatening violence because he's telling the truth.
[02:55:18.280 --> 02:55:20.280]  Can you give him some good advice on how...
[02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:21.280]  Let me fill Lord Monkton in.
[02:55:21.280 --> 02:55:24.280]  They've had Newsweek, Time Magazine, even London Guardian, actually,
[02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:27.280]  saying I'm calling for violence when I've never done anything like that,
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:29.280]  but they're also saying that about the Tea Parties.
[02:55:29.280 --> 02:55:31.280]  They're also saying that about Rick Perry.
[02:55:31.280 --> 02:55:33.280]  I mean, they're saying it about everybody,
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:35.280]  and now I don't know if Lord Monkton saw this,
[02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:40.280]  but the AP reported two days ago that Democrats have been caught with fake in-word signs,
[02:55:40.280 --> 02:55:45.280]  and they've been caught infiltrating Tea Parties trying to make us look bad.
[02:55:45.280 --> 02:55:48.280]  That's right. This is a very classic communist technique.
[02:55:48.280 --> 02:55:51.280]  It was done by Hitler, who, of course, was a national socialist,
[02:55:51.280 --> 02:55:53.280]  which was another kind of communism.
[02:55:53.280 --> 02:55:56.280]  It was done by the communists when they were taking over in Russia.
[02:55:56.280 --> 02:56:00.280]  It's an absolutely typical extreme left-wing technique.
[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:04.280]  They try to discredit those who they fear,
[02:56:04.280 --> 02:56:08.280]  knowing that they can rely upon the liberal tendencies of the mainstream media
[02:56:08.280 --> 02:56:10.280]  not to bother to ask the right questions.
[02:56:10.280 --> 02:56:13.280]  It's a very good question that your caller raises,
[02:56:13.280 --> 02:56:18.280]  and my advice is, of course, you should never advocate any kind of violence,
[02:56:18.280 --> 02:56:20.280]  nor, Alex, would you ever have done so.
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:24.280]  Well, we've done the opposite, but, I mean, especially George Soros,
[02:56:24.280 --> 02:56:28.280]  he's got, like, eight different publications that every week just lie.
[02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:30.280]  I mean, I could sue them, but I don't have the time.
[02:56:30.280 --> 02:56:31.280]  What do you do with people?
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:33.280]  I don't think it's ever worth suing these people.
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:38.280]  I think the answer is just to go on speaking the truth, speaking it gently,
[02:56:38.280 --> 02:56:44.280]  and it's rather like what Glenn Beck has been saying on his wonderful program on Fox News.
[02:56:44.280 --> 02:56:48.280]  He says the hammer of nonviolence has to hit the anvil of truth,
[02:56:48.280 --> 02:56:50.280]  and that's the way he's been putting it.
[02:56:50.280 --> 02:56:55.280]  I've met many Tea Partiers today. I went to a Liberty briefing just this morning
[02:56:55.280 --> 02:56:58.280]  and addressed it briefly, a wonderful crowd of people.
[02:56:58.280 --> 02:57:02.280]  Not one of them was advocating violence, except one infiltrator
[02:57:02.280 --> 02:57:05.280]  who was in there to find out what I was saying
[02:57:05.280 --> 02:57:08.280]  so he could go where and report it to Green Central Casting,
[02:57:08.280 --> 02:57:10.280]  and they could look it up and try and pick holes in it later.
[02:57:10.280 --> 02:57:12.280]  Everybody else was entirely involved.
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:15.280]  So you've gone through this, too. I mean, you have them trying to set you up.
[02:57:15.280 --> 02:57:19.280]  Oh, they're always doing that, but I pay no attention to it,
[02:57:19.280 --> 02:57:21.280]  you just have to go on quietly.
[02:57:21.280 --> 02:57:23.280]  I'm just quietly getting on with my scientific research.
[02:57:23.280 --> 02:57:26.280]  I pop up from time to time and publish the results.
[02:57:26.280 --> 02:57:31.280]  I'm just about to publish a major paper on this business of the effect of clouds on climate,
[02:57:31.280 --> 02:57:35.280]  which shows perfectly well that CO2 has virtually nothing to do with anything,
[02:57:35.280 --> 02:57:37.280]  and that's the way I do it.
[02:57:37.280 --> 02:57:40.280]  We just quietly published the science in the peer-reviewed journals,
[02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:43.280]  let people read it there and make of it what they will.
[02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:48.280]  That's the way science is done, and I don't mind how many sticks and stones they try to throw,
[02:57:48.280 --> 02:57:51.280]  how many, but words certainly won't hurt me.
[02:57:51.280 --> 02:57:55.280]  And the thing is, just be courageous, carry on speaking the truth.
[02:57:55.280 --> 02:58:00.280]  The truth in the end, as we are told in the Bible, will prevail.
[02:58:00.280 --> 02:58:05.280]  Absolutely. Lord Monkton, we've only got about 45 seconds left.
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:08.280]  I appreciate your time. Scienceandpublicpolicy.org.
[02:58:08.280 --> 02:58:12.280]  I know you say, as soon as you're done defeating these people, you're going to write a book.
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:17.280]  We look forward to having you on to cover that, and just so much continues to happen.
[02:58:17.280 --> 02:58:22.280]  And again, 5 to 10 p.m. Eastern today in front of the Washington Monument.
[02:58:22.280 --> 02:58:27.280]  Lord Monkton and others will be there, so definitely we look forward to watching those videos online,
[02:58:27.280 --> 02:58:31.280]  here from Austin and other areas of the planet, from your eloquent speech.
[02:58:31.280 --> 02:58:33.280]  Thank you so much for your time.
[02:58:33.280 --> 02:58:38.280]  File your tax return on time by the close of play today, and God bless America.
[02:58:38.280 --> 02:58:51.280]  Take care. Lord Monkton, thank you.
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:54.280]  Max, what did you do with the remote?
[02:58:54.280 --> 02:58:56.280]  Now what am I going to do?
[02:58:56.280 --> 02:58:58.280]  I guess I can go online to find a new one.
[02:58:58.280 --> 02:59:02.280]  Okay, here's a site, replacementremotes.com.
[02:59:02.280 --> 02:59:04.280]  Let us repair, replace any remote control.
[02:59:04.280 --> 02:59:07.280]  Well, I guess they can't repair this one.
[02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:09.280]  Thanks, Max.
[02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:14.280]  Wow, they have my original remote, and an exact replacement that doesn't need programming.

[03:01:12.280 --> 03:01:13.280]  Okay.
[03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:16.280]  I've got tax news I want to go over.
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:18.280]  I've got police state news.
[03:01:18.280 --> 03:01:19.280]  I've got big government news.
[03:01:19.280 --> 03:01:22.280]  I've got big developments in Poland.
[03:01:22.280 --> 03:01:28.280]  It's looking more and more like foul play with the death of the president and others last Saturday.
[03:01:28.280 --> 03:01:31.280]  That is all coming up.
[03:01:31.280 --> 03:01:33.280]  I've got my stacks here.
[03:01:33.280 --> 03:01:40.280]  But when we come back from this break, I'm going to play a video.
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:45.280]  When we come back from this break, I'm going to play video for the prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[03:01:45.280 --> 03:01:48.280]  And of course, radio listeners will be able to hear the audio.
[03:01:48.280 --> 03:01:52.280]  And then in the next few hours, this will be posted up on the Alex Jones YouTube channel.
[03:01:52.280 --> 03:01:53.280]  But it's not there yet.
[03:01:53.280 --> 03:01:56.280]  This will be the premiere of this information.
[03:01:56.280 --> 03:02:03.280]  Now, when we come back after the video, I will describe more of why I did this.
[03:02:03.280 --> 03:02:06.280]  Okay.
[03:02:06.280 --> 03:02:12.280]  First off, I was joking around the office about doing what I did just as a joke.
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:15.280]  Because we had a power drill laying there.
[03:02:15.280 --> 03:02:18.280]  And a few people got up and were like, oh, don't do that.
[03:02:18.280 --> 03:02:19.280]  It's wasteful, whatever.
[03:02:19.280 --> 03:02:21.280]  Then my wife was like, oh, no, don't do it.
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:22.280]  It's so sweet.
[03:02:22.280 --> 03:02:23.280]  It's so good.
[03:02:23.280 --> 03:02:27.280]  Like it was a human or something.
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:33.280]  And that got me thinking about priorities with all of us.
[03:02:33.280 --> 03:02:40.280]  And then I thought about, well, all these other facets that I break down at the end of the video.
[03:02:40.280 --> 03:02:44.280]  All these other reasons.
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:51.280]  Because this is going to be extremely educational on multiple, multiple fronts.
[03:02:51.280 --> 03:02:55.280]  That's what you're going to see.
[03:02:55.280 --> 03:02:58.280]  Now, of course, if I did this in two years, nobody would care.
[03:02:58.280 --> 03:03:04.280]  So it also ties in to hype.
[03:03:04.280 --> 03:03:10.280]  And so because it had so many issues tied into it, that's why we did it.
[03:03:10.280 --> 03:03:15.280]  And I can't think of better advertising.
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:20.280]  Advertising against bad things, against war, against torture,
[03:03:20.280 --> 03:03:25.280]  against police state, and against worshiping things.
[03:03:25.280 --> 03:03:28.280]  Now, on the other side, it's not just worshiping things.
[03:03:28.280 --> 03:03:30.280]  Some people don't like to waste.
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:32.280]  But this is certainly not a waste.
[03:03:32.280 --> 03:03:37.280]  This will be seen by a million people conservatively, probably in the next few months, definitely in the next year.
[03:03:37.280 --> 03:03:41.280]  I'm good at estimating how many views this will get just on one video.
[03:03:41.280 --> 03:03:44.280]  It'll be copied everywhere, probably tens of millions.
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:46.280]  You really can't even measure it.
[03:03:46.280 --> 03:03:52.280]  And think of how many people will get a bird's eye view into their mentality
[03:03:52.280 --> 03:03:55.280]  and how they can't form relationships with fellow humans
[03:03:55.280 --> 03:03:58.280]  and how we're being sucked in to this high-tech matrix.
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:04.280]  The average person playing hours of video games every day, four and a half hours of TV.
[03:04:04.280 --> 03:04:06.280]  Young people aren't even communicating with each other.
[03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:08.280]  They're just texting each other.
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:13.280]  If you're wondering what the mystery is, it will soon be revealed for you
[03:04:13.280 --> 03:04:16.280]  on the other side of this break.
[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:20.280]  We're going to come in, out of the break.
[03:04:20.280 --> 03:04:23.280]  Some stations join us then, so I'll introduce it briefly.
[03:04:23.280 --> 03:04:30.280]  Then we're going to play this 10-minute video premiere here at prisonplanet.tv
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:33.280]  and on the syndicated radio broadcast.
[03:04:33.280 --> 03:04:35.280]  And there's a psychological study here.
[03:04:35.280 --> 03:04:36.280]  There's a psychological test.
[03:04:36.280 --> 03:04:42.280]  That's only part of it, though.
[03:04:42.280 --> 03:04:48.280]  This is also a mass psychology test, a group psychology experiment
[03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:53.280]  that we are all about to take part in straight ahead on the other side.
[03:04:53.280 --> 03:04:55.280]  This is going to make a hubbub.
[03:04:55.280 --> 03:05:24.280]  And it shouldn't make a hubbub, but because of the mind control, it will.
[03:05:25.280 --> 03:05:26.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:05:26.280 --> 03:05:29.280]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:05:29.280 --> 03:05:55.280]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:05:55.280 --> 03:06:00.280]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[03:06:00.280 --> 03:06:01.280]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:06:01.280 --> 03:06:05.280]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[03:06:05.280 --> 03:06:07.280]  in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[03:06:07.280 --> 03:06:09.280]  Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[03:06:09.280 --> 03:06:12.280]  non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[03:06:12.280 --> 03:06:15.280]  It's true, seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country.
[03:06:15.280 --> 03:06:17.280]  And it's possible that could even happen again.
[03:06:17.280 --> 03:06:23.280]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[03:06:23.280 --> 03:06:25.280]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[03:06:25.280 --> 03:06:30.280]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food for you and your family.
[03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:31.280]  And here's the best part.
[03:06:31.280 --> 03:06:34.280]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[03:06:34.280 --> 03:06:38.280]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[03:06:38.280 --> 03:06:41.280]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:41.280 --> 03:06:43.280]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[03:06:43.280 --> 03:06:48.280]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[03:06:48.280 --> 03:06:52.280]  That's 877-327-0365.
[03:06:52.280 --> 03:06:57.280]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[03:06:57.280 --> 03:07:26.280]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[03:07:27.280 --> 03:07:31.280]  The silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream,
[03:07:31.280 --> 03:07:35.280]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products.
[03:07:35.280 --> 03:07:40.280]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:40.280 --> 03:07:46.280]  Very easy to follow, step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[03:07:46.280 --> 03:07:53.280]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[03:07:53.280 --> 03:08:00.280]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[03:08:24.280 --> 03:08:28.280]  Okay, I did a psychological test yesterday.
[03:08:28.280 --> 03:08:31.280]  I shot this video, did this in the office yesterday evening.
[03:08:31.280 --> 03:08:36.280]  Aaron worked very late and then today to put this video together, great job to Aaron Dykes.
[03:08:36.280 --> 03:08:42.280]  This is a psychological test and I explain why at the end of the video.
[03:08:42.280 --> 03:08:45.280]  And I predict this will create somewhat of a hubbub.
[03:08:45.280 --> 03:08:47.280]  People are going to be upset by this.
[03:08:47.280 --> 03:08:51.280]  They're not upset by humans being tortured by war, by police state,
[03:08:51.280 --> 03:08:56.280]  by seeing their fellow humans beaten for no reason, because we've been dehumanized.
[03:08:56.280 --> 03:08:59.280]  You see Marines throw a puppy off a cliff, everybody gets upset,
[03:08:59.280 --> 03:09:03.280]  because we haven't seen millions of simulated murders of animals.
[03:09:03.280 --> 03:09:06.280]  What would happen, though, if we did it to a computer?
[03:09:06.280 --> 03:09:10.280]  Something new, something trendy, something filled with hype.
[03:09:10.280 --> 03:09:33.280]  Let's go ahead and go to this video, the torture of an iPod.
[03:09:33.280 --> 03:09:41.280]  I was always taught torture was wrong, but I'm pro-America and now that they say torture is good,
[03:09:41.280 --> 03:09:48.280]  well, I decided that what women in Rome do is the Romans do.
[03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:52.280]  But humans don't care about seeing other humans tortured.
[03:09:52.280 --> 03:09:54.280]  We've been dehumanized.
[03:09:54.280 --> 03:09:57.280]  They got mad when the Marines threw that puppy off the cliff,
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:09:59.280]  because people still have empathy for animals.
[03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:02.280]  I thought, what about an iPad?
[03:10:02.280 --> 03:10:04.280]  What is it going to think?
[03:10:04.280 --> 03:10:06.280]  People love inanimate objects.
[03:10:06.280 --> 03:10:08.280]  They love things, they love possessions.
[03:10:08.280 --> 03:10:22.280]  They don't get upset by humans being tortured.
[03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:28.280]  So I thought, what would happen if we tortured an iPad?
[03:10:28.280 --> 03:10:35.280]  And that's what we're about to do.
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:40.280]  A 12-pound sledgehammer.
[03:10:40.280 --> 03:10:44.280]  Make sure this is working.
[03:10:44.280 --> 03:10:48.280]  Just a professional interrogation for America, what we do, the good guys.
[03:10:48.280 --> 03:10:52.280]  After all, Joseph Minglow wasn't that bad, was he now, according to our government.
[03:10:52.280 --> 03:11:00.280]  The electrical power here, and of course, made the USA waterboarding equivalent.
[03:11:00.280 --> 03:11:04.280]  We're going to have a discussion with you, Mr. iPad.
[03:11:04.280 --> 03:11:05.280]  You understand?
[03:11:05.280 --> 03:11:07.280]  And you're going to answer our questions.
[03:11:07.280 --> 03:11:12.280]  Al Gore's on your board, and you guys pose as a bunch of egalitarian liberals,
[03:11:12.280 --> 03:11:18.280]  but you're made in China by basically slave labor.
[03:11:18.280 --> 03:11:21.280]  Well, Mr. iPad, again, I'm going to ask you,
[03:11:21.280 --> 03:11:23.280]  why are you made in China?
[03:11:23.280 --> 03:11:27.280]  This is going to go on for a long time here, and it's only going to get rougher.
[03:11:27.280 --> 03:11:30.280]  Oh, you're going to not respond?
[03:11:30.280 --> 03:11:31.280]  Well, that's fine.
[03:11:31.280 --> 03:11:34.280]  At the end of our little session with the iPad,
[03:11:34.280 --> 03:11:37.280]  I'm going to explain exactly why we're doing this in detail.
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:40.280]  But overall, it's an important experiment.
[03:11:40.280 --> 03:11:45.280]  We've got all these different implements of torture or enhanced interrogation,
[03:11:45.280 --> 03:11:50.280]  but I figure we just go ahead and cut right to the chase with the power drill.
[03:11:50.280 --> 03:11:53.280]  This is one of the tools of the CIA.
[03:11:53.280 --> 03:11:56.280]  I've told it to explain to us why it's in league with Al Gore,
[03:11:56.280 --> 03:11:58.280]  and it will not answer my question.
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:00.280]  We're going to get really serious right now.
[03:12:00.280 --> 03:12:01.280]  We're going to get some answers.
[03:12:01.280 --> 03:12:12.280]  Now I'm not even going to ask you questions.
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:16.280]  This is like in Pakistan when a predator drone drops a bomb on a wedding.
[03:12:16.280 --> 03:12:20.280]  Now we're just going to kill your ass, because that's pro-America!
[03:12:20.280 --> 03:12:22.280]  Yeah!
[03:12:22.280 --> 03:12:31.280]  Come on, yeah!
[03:12:31.280 --> 03:12:33.280]  Answer my questions!
[03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:34.280]  We're the good guys!
[03:12:34.280 --> 03:12:36.280]  We're America!
[03:12:36.280 --> 03:12:38.280]  You will answer our questions!
[03:12:38.280 --> 03:12:41.280]  Torture is good!
[03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:43.280]  I smell China.
[03:12:43.280 --> 03:12:47.280]  Literally, you can smell it. Look at that smoke coming out.
[03:12:47.280 --> 03:12:51.280]  Let me get you cleaned up for the next round.
[03:12:51.280 --> 03:12:53.280]  Well, you're still alive.
[03:12:53.280 --> 03:12:55.280]  We've been torturing you for quite a while,
[03:12:55.280 --> 03:12:57.280]  because again, that's the American way.
[03:12:57.280 --> 03:12:58.280]  That's freedom.
[03:12:58.280 --> 03:13:04.280]  And now we're going to go ahead and put you out of your misery with a firing squad.
[03:13:04.280 --> 03:13:08.280]  So let's put your little blindfold on.
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:11.280]  Let's give you a cigarette.
[03:13:11.280 --> 03:13:12.280]  Good.
[03:13:12.280 --> 03:13:17.280]  It's time for the firing squad.
[03:13:17.280 --> 03:13:19.280]  For high treason.
[03:13:19.280 --> 03:13:22.280]  No judge, no court, no nothing.
[03:13:22.280 --> 03:13:25.280]  Under the enemy belligerence act, now in the U.S. Senate,
[03:13:25.280 --> 03:13:28.280]  we're allowed to arrest you as a U.S. citizen.
[03:13:28.280 --> 03:13:30.280]  Torture you, kill you, do whatever we want,
[03:13:30.280 --> 03:13:32.280]  because that is freedom.
[03:13:32.280 --> 03:13:34.280]  Enjoy your cigarette.
[03:13:34.280 --> 03:13:36.280]  No trial, no nothing.
[03:13:36.280 --> 03:13:39.280]  Under the USA Patriot Act, iPad, you are terminated.
[03:13:39.280 --> 03:13:43.280]  Ready, aim, fire.
[03:13:43.280 --> 03:13:45.280]  Well, it looks like that didn't do it.
[03:13:45.280 --> 03:13:47.280]  Let me have to shoot you a couple more times here.
[03:13:47.280 --> 03:13:49.280]  This is going to continue for a while here.
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:51.280]  I'm doing this because I'm a patriot.
[03:13:51.280 --> 03:13:54.280]  I'm going to take your bank accounts because I'm a patriot.
[03:13:54.280 --> 03:13:56.280]  I'm going to set up checkpoints because I'm a patriot.
[03:13:56.280 --> 03:13:59.280]  Everything I do is because I'm a patriot.
[03:13:59.280 --> 03:14:01.280]  You're an evil act.
[03:14:01.280 --> 03:14:07.280]  And one more right between the eyes is to get you out of your pain.
[03:14:07.280 --> 03:14:11.280]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how we deal with terrorists.
[03:14:11.280 --> 03:14:13.280]  You know, after we torture somebody to death,
[03:14:13.280 --> 03:14:15.280]  we've got to get rid of the body. We've got to dismember it.
[03:14:15.280 --> 03:14:17.280]  So even though the iPad is no longer with us,
[03:14:17.280 --> 03:14:19.280]  we've got to get rid of the evidence.
[03:14:23.280 --> 03:14:25.280]  Oh, the guts.
[03:14:27.280 --> 03:14:31.280]  It's almost as funny as one of the dead Iraqi kids.
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:33.280]  I'm returning information to the kitchen.
[03:14:33.280 --> 03:14:36.280]  Oh yeah, look at that. Right through the windshield.
[03:14:36.280 --> 03:14:39.280]  Those weapons of mass destruction have got to be somewhere.
[03:14:42.280 --> 03:14:44.280]  Nope, no weapons over there.
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:49.280]  It's almost as funny as one of the dead Iraqi kids.
[03:14:49.280 --> 03:14:53.280]  Designed in America, made in China.
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:58.280]  You have just taken part in a psychological test, a study.
[03:14:58.280 --> 03:15:00.280]  There's a lot of different facets to it.
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:04.280]  Number one, I like Apple. I like the iPad.
[03:15:04.280 --> 03:15:07.280]  We have a couple in the office and I bought one at home.
[03:15:07.280 --> 03:15:10.280]  But I've seen people literally worshiping these machines.
[03:15:10.280 --> 03:15:12.280]  You know, humans don't care about fellow humans anymore,
[03:15:12.280 --> 03:15:15.280]  but they care about inanimate objects.
[03:15:15.280 --> 03:15:17.280]  And I said, we ought to do a psychological test
[03:15:17.280 --> 03:15:19.280]  to show how people get upset out on the web
[03:15:19.280 --> 03:15:22.280]  about watching the video you just saw,
[03:15:22.280 --> 03:15:24.280]  but don't care about Iraqi kids
[03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:26.280]  in a minivan being murdered in front of everybody.
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:28.280]  This is the dehumanization.
[03:15:28.280 --> 03:15:30.280]  We saw that a year ago when the Marines throw the puppy off the cliff,
[03:15:30.280 --> 03:15:32.280]  and it was admitted the Marines had done it,
[03:15:32.280 --> 03:15:34.280]  and the Marine Corps admitted they'd done it,
[03:15:34.280 --> 03:15:36.280]  and actually kicked them out of the Corps,
[03:15:36.280 --> 03:15:38.280]  but people were still living in denial saying,
[03:15:38.280 --> 03:15:40.280]  no, the Marines didn't kill that puppy. It's too evil.
[03:15:40.280 --> 03:15:43.280]  See, Iraqis are dehumanized, but the puppy, it matters.
[03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:47.280]  Well, the puppy matters a hell of a lot more than this iPad did,
[03:15:47.280 --> 03:15:49.280]  and over a million Iraqis in the last seven years
[03:15:49.280 --> 03:15:51.280]  have been killed conservatively,
[03:15:51.280 --> 03:15:54.280]  and their society was wrecked like this iPad.
[03:15:54.280 --> 03:15:56.280]  And so that's one reason I did this.
[03:15:56.280 --> 03:16:00.280]  I also wanted to show, and I'll guarantee in the comments below,
[03:16:00.280 --> 03:16:02.280]  in this YouTube video, you'll see it,
[03:16:02.280 --> 03:16:04.280]  that people are going to be angry that I did this
[03:16:04.280 --> 03:16:07.280]  because they associate it with a living thing.
[03:16:07.280 --> 03:16:10.280]  And in the future, computers may become artificially intelligent.
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:12.280]  Like Isaac Asimov talked about 60 years ago,
[03:16:12.280 --> 03:16:15.280]  there'll be laws against doing this to computers.
[03:16:15.280 --> 03:16:18.280]  That shows how twisted our worldview has gotten,
[03:16:18.280 --> 03:16:21.280]  where we've been trained by the eugenicist environmentalists
[03:16:21.280 --> 03:16:23.280]  that human life means nothing.
[03:16:23.280 --> 03:16:25.280]  But I do want to add something here.
[03:16:25.280 --> 03:16:27.280]  I don't believe in reincarnation.
[03:16:27.280 --> 03:16:29.280]  Not in animal life, not in human life,
[03:16:29.280 --> 03:16:32.280]  but in the case of this iPad, it did not die.
[03:16:32.280 --> 03:16:36.280]  Its consciousness, or all of its programs and apps,
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:38.280]  are downloaded on two computers over there,
[03:16:38.280 --> 03:16:40.280]  and we've already bought a replacement.
[03:16:40.280 --> 03:16:43.280]  And so, literally, the data that was in this iPad
[03:16:43.280 --> 03:16:46.280]  will repossess and will enter the body of a new iPad.
[03:16:46.280 --> 03:16:50.280]  But Iraqi civilization and many other civilizations,
[03:16:50.280 --> 03:16:54.280]  many areas of Serbia, have been reduced to rubble
[03:16:54.280 --> 03:16:56.280]  that resembles this pile of junk.
[03:16:56.280 --> 03:16:59.280]  Then, of course, there's another facet.
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:02.280]  Apple claims they're all liberal and trendy
[03:17:02.280 --> 03:17:04.280]  and care about humanity, but Al Gore,
[03:17:04.280 --> 03:17:08.280]  who wants to put carbon taxes that will reduce world population
[03:17:08.280 --> 03:17:10.280]  in place, is on their board.
[03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:13.280]  And Apple pushes all of this anti-private property rights,
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:15.280]  anti-human propaganda.
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:18.280]  And so, I guess it makes sense that they have giant factories
[03:17:18.280 --> 03:17:21.280]  with people working for slave wages all over China.
[03:17:21.280 --> 03:17:24.280]  Oh, yeah, designed in America, made in China.
[03:17:24.280 --> 03:17:26.280]  And the people that are being paid so little,
[03:17:26.280 --> 03:17:29.280]  they can't ever afford to buy an iPad.
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:32.280]  And so, there's also a lot of hypocrisy there.
[03:17:32.280 --> 03:17:35.280]  I think technology is great, but it's a double-edged sword.
[03:17:35.280 --> 03:17:38.280]  It can be used as a tool for good or for bad.
[03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:40.280]  But for those of you out there that were upset
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:43.280]  by seeing this happen, or think it was wasteful,
[03:17:43.280 --> 03:17:46.280]  500 bucks, this will probably get a million views in the next year,
[03:17:46.280 --> 03:17:49.280]  and will educate thousands and thousands of people
[03:17:49.280 --> 03:17:52.280]  that watch it who will get what we did here today.
[03:17:52.280 --> 03:17:55.280]  Of course, there's the subject of torture itself.
[03:17:55.280 --> 03:17:57.280]  The Army's own report, the Togunbi report admitted
[03:17:57.280 --> 03:18:00.280]  they were raping children, torturing people with battery acid,
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:04.280]  with drills, torturing people's children in front of them.
[03:18:04.280 --> 03:18:07.280]  Those are human beings, ladies and gentlemen,
[03:18:07.280 --> 03:18:11.280]  and are a trillion times more important than this iPad
[03:18:11.280 --> 03:18:14.280]  that the mind of man created.
[03:18:14.280 --> 03:18:16.280]  Man is the greatest species on this planet.
[03:18:16.280 --> 03:18:18.280]  Man is reaching towards the stars.
[03:18:18.280 --> 03:18:21.280]  And we also need to be wary of the future of technology
[03:18:21.280 --> 03:18:23.280]  less its supplant humanity
[03:18:23.280 --> 03:18:27.280]  and be used by a technocratic elite to set up a prison planet.
[03:18:27.280 --> 03:18:30.280]  The elite have written many white papers stating
[03:18:30.280 --> 03:18:33.280]  that because they have robotics and automation,
[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:35.280]  they don't need a large population anymore.
[03:18:35.280 --> 03:18:37.280]  That's why Bill Joy back in 2000 wrote the article
[03:18:37.280 --> 03:18:39.280]  Why the Future Doesn't Need Us
[03:18:39.280 --> 03:18:41.280]  and discussed the fact that the elite
[03:18:41.280 --> 03:18:44.280]  are seriously considering exterminating
[03:18:44.280 --> 03:18:46.280]  the majority of the world population.
[03:18:46.280 --> 03:18:49.280]  I know a lot of you went to college
[03:18:49.280 --> 03:18:51.280]  and you believe in the people bomb
[03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:53.280]  and you believe there's too many people.
[03:18:53.280 --> 03:18:55.280]  The problem is you don't understand
[03:18:55.280 --> 03:18:57.280]  that you're in the cross areas of the elite as well.
[03:18:57.280 --> 03:18:59.280]  And machines are being used as one of the major tools
[03:18:59.280 --> 03:19:02.280]  to control us, to track us, to predict our movements,
[03:19:02.280 --> 03:19:04.280]  to predict our very thoughts.
[03:19:04.280 --> 03:19:07.280]  And so it's important to keep technology
[03:19:07.280 --> 03:19:10.280]  on a very short leash
[03:19:10.280 --> 03:19:13.280]  lest it be used to enslave us.
[03:19:13.280 --> 03:19:16.280]  Again, I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com.
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:18.280]  I hope this little presentation
[03:19:18.280 --> 03:19:20.280]  has spurred some of you to think.
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:22.280]  I hope you'll have lively discussions with your friends
[03:19:22.280 --> 03:19:24.280]  and co-workers and neighbors
[03:19:24.280 --> 03:19:27.280]  about the torture of an iPad.
[03:19:27.280 --> 03:19:29.280]  Of all the reasons we did this,
[03:19:29.280 --> 03:19:31.280]  number one is to get you thinking out there.
[03:19:31.280 --> 03:19:34.280]  Many of you can't form relationships with fellow humans now.
[03:19:34.280 --> 03:19:36.280]  You're only forming them with machines.
[03:19:36.280 --> 03:19:38.280]  You're losing your humanity.
[03:19:38.280 --> 03:19:40.280]  The vocabulary of the average American
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:43.280]  has shrunk by thousands and thousands of words.
[03:19:43.280 --> 03:19:45.280]  In the statistics show, it's even getting worse
[03:19:45.280 --> 03:19:47.280]  with young people, with teenagers.
[03:19:47.280 --> 03:19:49.280]  You go out to a restaurant.
[03:19:49.280 --> 03:19:51.280]  You see all the kids around the table texting their friends.
[03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:53.280]  I love technology.
[03:19:53.280 --> 03:19:55.280]  We're going to go to break.
[03:19:55.280 --> 03:19:57.280]  We're going to come back and play that last piece by itself.
[03:19:57.280 --> 03:19:59.280]  Then get into the news and take your phone call.
[03:19:59.280 --> 03:20:01.280]  Stay with us.
[03:20:01.280 --> 03:20:05.280]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[03:20:05.280 --> 03:20:07.280]  Tyranny is here.
[03:20:07.280 --> 03:20:10.280]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:20:10.280 --> 03:20:13.280]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:20:13.280 --> 03:20:15.280]  The United States has now recognized globally
[03:20:15.280 --> 03:20:18.280]  as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[03:20:18.280 --> 03:20:21.280]  This film conclusively proves the existence
[03:20:21.280 --> 03:20:23.280]  of a secret network of FEMA cameras
[03:20:23.280 --> 03:20:25.280]  now being expanded nationwide.
[03:20:25.280 --> 03:20:28.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program
[03:20:28.280 --> 03:20:31.280]  has established an old powerful shadow state.
[03:20:31.280 --> 03:20:33.280]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths
[03:20:33.280 --> 03:20:35.280]  to which our republic has fallen.
[03:20:35.280 --> 03:20:39.280]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:20:39.280 --> 03:20:42.280]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies,
[03:20:42.280 --> 03:20:45.280]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:20:45.280 --> 03:20:48.280]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:50.280]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:20:50.280 --> 03:20:52.280]  It's here.

[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:00.280]  Solutions for your area of operation.
[03:22:00.280 --> 03:22:02.280]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government
[03:22:02.280 --> 03:22:04.280]  to be the guardians of currency
[03:22:04.280 --> 03:22:07.280]  to ensure purity, content, weights and measures
[03:22:07.280 --> 03:22:10.280]  of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[03:22:10.280 --> 03:22:12.280]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise
[03:22:12.280 --> 03:22:14.280]  of the fiat continental system.
[03:22:14.280 --> 03:22:16.280]  Wisdom being lost with time.
[03:22:16.280 --> 03:22:19.280]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit
[03:22:19.280 --> 03:22:21.280]  has colluded with private business
[03:22:21.280 --> 03:22:24.280]  creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme
[03:22:24.280 --> 03:22:26.280]  our country ever experienced.
[03:22:26.280 --> 03:22:29.280]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution
[03:22:29.280 --> 03:22:31.280]  that is not accountable to our elected government
[03:22:31.280 --> 03:22:34.280]  but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents
[03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:35.280]  of its original value.
[03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:38.280]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves
[03:22:38.280 --> 03:22:40.280]  from this once world reserve currency.
[03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:42.280]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:42.280 --> 03:22:44.280]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[03:22:44.280 --> 03:22:48.280]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:48.280 --> 03:22:51.280]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[03:22:51.280 --> 03:22:55.280]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[03:22:55.280 --> 03:23:22.280]  You worry. You see the signs and worry about the future.
[03:23:22.280 --> 03:23:25.280]  The cost of learning is minimal. Wild food grows everywhere
[03:23:25.280 --> 03:23:27.280]  and you will see it everywhere.
[03:23:27.280 --> 03:23:30.280]  It's every bit organic and more nutritious than our modern diets.
[03:23:30.280 --> 03:23:33.280]  Well respected in her field, Linda's approach to teaching this subject
[03:23:33.280 --> 03:23:35.280]  includes books, flashcards, and video
[03:23:35.280 --> 03:23:38.280]  with an emphasis on health, safety, practicality, and joy.
[03:23:38.280 --> 03:23:41.280]  Learn how to identify it, where and when to find it,
[03:23:41.280 --> 03:23:43.280]  how to prepare, use, and store it.
[03:23:43.280 --> 03:23:45.280]  Go to Linda's website ofthefield.com
[03:23:45.280 --> 03:23:47.280]  and take advantage of special offers
[03:23:47.280 --> 03:23:50.280]  or if you're not online, call her 24-hour toll-free order line
[03:23:50.280 --> 03:23:53.280]  at 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[03:23:53.280 --> 03:23:56.280]  That number again, 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[03:23:56.280 --> 03:23:59.280]  A little knowledge makes starvation impossible.
[03:23:59.280 --> 03:24:02.280]  Of an iPad. Of all the reasons we did this.
[03:24:02.280 --> 03:24:04.280]  Number one is to get you thinking out there.
[03:24:04.280 --> 03:24:07.280]  Many of you can't form relationships with fellow humans now.
[03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:09.280]  You're only forming them with machines.
[03:24:09.280 --> 03:24:11.280]  You're losing your humanity.
[03:24:11.280 --> 03:24:14.280]  The vocabulary of the average American has shrunk
[03:24:14.280 --> 03:24:16.280]  by thousands and thousands of words
[03:24:16.280 --> 03:24:19.280]  and the statistics show it's even getting worse with young people.
[03:24:19.280 --> 03:24:22.280]  With teenagers, you go out to a restaurant.
[03:24:22.280 --> 03:24:25.280]  You see all the kids around the table texting their friends.
[03:24:25.280 --> 03:24:28.280]  I love technology, but I also understand the downsides.
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:30.280]  And that's why we showed you here.
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:32.280]  It isn't machines that matter.
[03:24:32.280 --> 03:24:34.280]  It's the people that built them.
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:36.280]  It's this precious species.
[03:24:36.280 --> 03:24:39.280]  Rediscover the power of humanity.
[03:24:39.280 --> 03:24:50.280]  Music plays
[03:24:50.280 --> 03:24:52.280]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:24:52.280 --> 03:24:55.280]  Tax Day 2010.
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:58.280]  I'm going to take phone calls for the balance of the hour.
[03:24:58.280 --> 03:25:02.280]  We have some other very informative guests joining us tomorrow.
[03:25:02.280 --> 03:25:04.280]  I'll just leave it at that.
[03:25:04.280 --> 03:25:07.280]  We've had Gerald Salente on yesterday.
[03:25:07.280 --> 03:25:10.280]  Of course, today at Lorcus for Moncton last hour.
[03:25:10.280 --> 03:25:12.280]  And Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:25:12.280 --> 03:25:15.280]  We have some extremely powerful, important guests
[03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:17.280]  covering amazing information.
[03:25:17.280 --> 03:25:19.280]  Very powerful information tomorrow.
[03:25:19.280 --> 03:25:21.280]  So be sure and join us.
[03:25:21.280 --> 03:25:25.280]  We do have the premiere coming up in T-minus 35 minutes
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:29.280]  at PrisonPlanet.tv in what, five different formats?
[03:25:29.280 --> 03:25:32.280]  High quality flash,
[03:25:32.280 --> 03:25:35.280]  QuickTime, DivX, a bunch of others
[03:25:35.280 --> 03:25:38.280]  at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:40.280]  Film 18 months in the making.
[03:25:40.280 --> 03:25:43.280]  Premiering in T-minus 35 minutes.
[03:25:43.280 --> 03:25:45.280]  We are go Houston, right?
[03:25:45.280 --> 03:25:47.280]  We are go my T guys in there.
[03:25:47.280 --> 03:25:48.280]  We are go video crew.
[03:25:48.280 --> 03:25:50.280]  We are go, go, go.
[03:25:50.280 --> 03:25:52.280]  Info Wars is go, go, go.
[03:25:52.280 --> 03:25:54.280]  Launch weapon systems.
[03:25:54.280 --> 03:25:56.280]  Launch, launch.
[03:25:56.280 --> 03:25:58.280]  It'll be up at PrisonPlanet.tv
[03:25:58.280 --> 03:26:02.280]  in T-minus 34 minutes.
[03:26:02.280 --> 03:26:04.280]  34 minute countdown.
[03:26:04.280 --> 03:26:06.280]  This is Kate Carnaveral launch center
[03:26:06.280 --> 03:26:11.280]  preparing to initiate final countdown in sequence.
[03:26:11.280 --> 03:26:14.280]  Launch is go, launch is go.
[03:26:14.280 --> 03:26:16.280]  Houston is go.
[03:26:16.280 --> 03:26:19.280]  I tell you, we make films that get seen
[03:26:19.280 --> 03:26:23.280]  conservatively tens of millions of times per film.
[03:26:23.280 --> 03:26:25.280]  And it's my enjoyment.
[03:26:25.280 --> 03:26:26.280]  The fight tyranny.
[03:26:26.280 --> 03:26:27.280]  It feels good.
[03:26:27.280 --> 03:26:29.280]  It's like when you lance a pus filled boil.
[03:26:29.280 --> 03:26:31.280]  It's gross, but it's satisfying
[03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:33.280]  because the pus is getting out.
[03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:35.280]  And it's scary to know this stuff.
[03:26:35.280 --> 03:26:37.280]  It's scary to face the truth, but I don't know.
[03:26:37.280 --> 03:26:39.280]  What's that Patrick Henry quote?
[03:26:39.280 --> 03:26:41.280]  I will know the whole of the truth.
[03:26:41.280 --> 03:26:45.280]  I will know the horrible truth and make provision for it.
[03:26:45.280 --> 03:26:47.280]  I know there are some timid souls out there
[03:26:47.280 --> 03:26:49.280]  that don't want to know the truth.
[03:26:49.280 --> 03:26:51.280]  Forget that you are our brethren.
[03:26:51.280 --> 03:26:53.280]  Go from us in peace.
[03:26:53.280 --> 03:26:56.280]  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.
[03:26:56.280 --> 03:27:01.280]  But as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[03:27:01.280 --> 03:27:04.280]  So again, we're going to interspersed a lot of key news,
[03:27:04.280 --> 03:27:08.280]  some top stories recap here in this hour and your phone calls.
[03:27:08.280 --> 03:27:10.280]  Let's go to Christopher in Arizona right now.
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:12.280]  Christopher, welcome.
[03:27:12.280 --> 03:27:14.280]  Hello Alex, how are you?
[03:27:14.280 --> 03:27:15.280]  Good sir.
[03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:17.280]  What do you think of the murder of the iPad?
[03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:20.280]  Oh, how could you do that?
[03:27:20.280 --> 03:27:21.280]  It's our God.
[03:27:21.280 --> 03:27:22.280]  We worship it.
[03:27:22.280 --> 03:27:23.280]  We live by it.
[03:27:23.280 --> 03:27:25.280]  It tells us what to do, what to buy, what to watch.
[03:27:25.280 --> 03:27:26.280]  It tracks us.
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:28.280]  And so big brother knows we're safe.
[03:27:28.280 --> 03:27:31.280]  It's to take care of you though.
[03:27:31.280 --> 03:27:32.280]  Exactly.
[03:27:32.280 --> 03:27:34.280]  I have a few questions actually.
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:36.280]  Go ahead.
[03:27:36.280 --> 03:27:40.280]  Well, if we, like stay down the road, you know,
[03:27:40.280 --> 03:27:43.280]  we try to resist the carbon tax, blah, blah, blah,
[03:27:43.280 --> 03:27:47.280]  which, you know, John McCain is for.
[03:27:47.280 --> 03:27:50.280]  Do you think there's a possibility that they could use
[03:27:50.280 --> 03:27:54.280]  Northcom troops, possibly with UN troops to enforce that
[03:27:54.280 --> 03:27:58.280]  under that, uh, that law was eight seven dash two nine seven.
[03:27:58.280 --> 03:28:02.280]  Say that again to enforce what?
[03:28:02.280 --> 03:28:06.280]  To enforce complying with the carbon tax like people resist.
[03:28:06.280 --> 03:28:07.280]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:28:07.280 --> 03:28:11.280]  But instead they're just saying the EPA separate from
[03:28:11.280 --> 03:28:13.280]  Congress can do whatever it wants.
[03:28:13.280 --> 03:28:17.280]  And of course the Constitution says Congress makes the laws
[03:28:17.280 --> 03:28:22.280]  and it's the power and then the executive executes it.
[03:28:22.280 --> 03:28:25.280]  And so that's upside down or butt backwards as they say.
[03:28:25.280 --> 03:28:28.280]  They have a more graphic way of saying it.
[03:28:28.280 --> 03:28:32.280]  But we're a family show here broadcast.
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:35.280]  But absolutely everything's being done by executive Fiat.
[03:28:35.280 --> 03:28:38.280]  But not just at the federal level, states, cities, counties
[03:28:38.280 --> 03:28:40.280]  are acting like a bunch of brigands.
[03:28:40.280 --> 03:28:42.280]  And we've got to stand up to the thugs and say,
[03:28:42.280 --> 03:28:44.280]  you are not my owner.
[03:28:44.280 --> 03:28:46.280]  I am not a slave.
[03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:47.280]  Yeah.
[03:28:47.280 --> 03:28:49.280]  Well, well, you know, the Constitution is just a dang piece
[03:28:49.280 --> 03:28:51.280]  of paper anyways, right?
[03:28:51.280 --> 03:28:54.280]  Well, that is what congressmen are now saying on video that
[03:28:54.280 --> 03:29:00.280]  congressman what last week from Illinois on video says he
[03:29:00.280 --> 03:29:01.280]  doesn't care about it.
[03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:04.280]  And George Bush said it's a gd piece of paper.
[03:29:04.280 --> 03:29:05.280]  Right.
[03:29:05.280 --> 03:29:08.280]  Remember that everything Obama is executing is all part of the
[03:29:08.280 --> 03:29:11.280]  same plan Bush was executing and the same plan Clinton was
[03:29:11.280 --> 03:29:13.280]  executing because these politicians come and go the
[03:29:13.280 --> 03:29:15.280]  globalist are there running it.
[03:29:15.280 --> 03:29:16.280]  Right.
[03:29:16.280 --> 03:29:19.280]  I wanted to share a police state experience with you if I
[03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:21.280]  could real quick real fast.
[03:29:21.280 --> 03:29:22.280]  Christopher, go ahead.
[03:29:22.280 --> 03:29:23.280]  Okay.
[03:29:23.280 --> 03:29:24.280]  Well, I was coming to work.
[03:29:24.280 --> 03:29:26.280]  I work on a military base and I was coming through the main
[03:29:26.280 --> 03:29:31.280]  gate and, you know, I went through got to my shop and then
[03:29:31.280 --> 03:29:35.280]  I get a, I get called into the office by my supervisor and he
[03:29:35.280 --> 03:29:37.280]  asked, stay there.
[03:29:37.280 --> 03:29:39.280]  We're going to come back to Christopher to finish the story
[03:29:39.280 --> 03:29:43.280]  than Justin, Lynn, Rob, Brian and others and a news blitz as
[03:29:43.280 --> 03:29:44.280]  well.
[03:29:44.280 --> 03:29:47.280]  It's the day you pay the federal reserve your money.
[03:29:47.280 --> 03:29:50.280]  It's the day you bend over and the globalists have their way
[03:29:50.280 --> 03:30:06.280]  with you.
[03:30:06.280 --> 03:30:09.280]  Before I go back to Christopher, Justin, Lynn, Rob, Brian and
[03:30:09.280 --> 03:30:12.280]  others and get to a bunch of important news interspersed.
[03:30:12.280 --> 03:30:15.280]  I want to give a program note for prisonplanet.tv viewers that
[03:30:15.280 --> 03:30:18.280]  are watching us live and are going to be watching Invisible
[03:30:18.280 --> 03:30:21.280]  Empire coming up here in about 30 minutes at prisonplanet.tv.
[03:30:21.280 --> 03:30:24.280]  This has happened the last few films we launched.
[03:30:24.280 --> 03:30:28.280]  We have CDNs, several CDNs, so there's never a problem serving
[03:30:28.280 --> 03:30:31.280]  out thousands of copies of the film in the first hour when
[03:30:31.280 --> 03:30:35.280]  people hit it, but the static site is on one server and it's a
[03:30:35.280 --> 03:30:40.280]  beefy server, but it always gets sluggish or shuts down when
[03:30:40.280 --> 03:30:42.280]  we have the big dynamic fancy site.
[03:30:42.280 --> 03:30:46.280]  So for a day or so when we do launch a new film, we go to a
[03:30:46.280 --> 03:30:48.280]  plan B and we're setting that up right now.
[03:30:48.280 --> 03:30:50.280]  We'll be right in the next 30 minutes.
[03:30:50.280 --> 03:30:57.280]  We're just a static page with a member login, passcode, and
[03:30:57.280 --> 03:31:04.280]  once that happens, people will be able to go in to those
[03:31:04.280 --> 03:31:07.280]  boxes and just put your username, passcode, or sign in and
[03:31:07.280 --> 03:31:09.280]  then you'll just head right there on the front page.
[03:31:09.280 --> 03:31:12.280]  There's all the different versions of the film for anybody
[03:31:12.280 --> 03:31:14.280]  that wants to be able to see it.
[03:31:14.280 --> 03:31:19.280]  Anybody that wants to be able to download it.
[03:31:19.280 --> 03:31:22.280]  We're going to have downloads of it, streams, flash, a whole
[03:31:22.280 --> 03:31:23.280]  bunch of different formats.
[03:31:23.280 --> 03:31:24.280]  They're all there.
[03:31:24.280 --> 03:31:26.280]  And that only usually happens for a few hours and everybody
[03:31:26.280 --> 03:31:29.280]  hits it and wants it right at once.
[03:31:29.280 --> 03:31:32.280]  So that is going on.
[03:31:32.280 --> 03:31:34.280]  But again, I want to go back to your phone calls.
[03:31:34.280 --> 03:31:37.280]  Invisible Empire, no longer defined, premiering today in
[03:31:37.280 --> 03:31:40.280]  about 30 minutes and the next Wednesday, police state for
[03:31:40.280 --> 03:31:42.280]  the rise of FEMA minute film.
[03:31:42.280 --> 03:31:47.280]  Let's go ahead and take another phone call here.
[03:31:47.280 --> 03:31:50.280]  Let's go back to Christopher who was telling a story in
[03:31:50.280 --> 03:31:52.280]  Arizona about he works on a military base.
[03:31:52.280 --> 03:31:54.280]  He drives through the gate, goes into the shop where he's
[03:31:54.280 --> 03:31:55.280]  working.
[03:31:55.280 --> 03:31:58.280]  Please continue, Christopher.
[03:31:58.280 --> 03:31:59.280]  Yes.
[03:31:59.280 --> 03:32:02.280]  Well, my supervisor basically told me that there's a federal
[03:32:02.280 --> 03:32:06.280]  agent, some type of investigator who came in behind me and
[03:32:06.280 --> 03:32:10.280]  he'd called our higher ups and told them.
[03:32:10.280 --> 03:32:12.280]  So they, you know, crap rolls downhill.
[03:32:12.280 --> 03:32:13.280]  So then it came to me.
[03:32:13.280 --> 03:32:16.280]  But basically it's because I have your, you know, 9-Eleven was
[03:32:16.280 --> 03:32:20.280]  an inside job bumper sticker and live for your die on my, on
[03:32:20.280 --> 03:32:22.280]  the back of my Durango.
[03:32:22.280 --> 03:32:24.280]  And I guess he's pulling it right behind me.
[03:32:24.280 --> 03:32:27.280]  And he saw that and, you know, he had to, he had to stop
[03:32:27.280 --> 03:32:28.280]  Al Qaeda.
[03:32:28.280 --> 03:32:29.280]  So he called my shop.
[03:32:29.280 --> 03:32:31.280]  I just wanted to share that.
[03:32:31.280 --> 03:32:33.280]  Well, we get reports and some of us come out in the
[03:32:33.280 --> 03:32:37.280]  newspaper where one famous case that was in the news several
[03:32:37.280 --> 03:32:44.280]  times, Kelly rushing in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[03:32:44.280 --> 03:32:46.280]  It was in the newspaper.
[03:32:46.280 --> 03:32:48.280]  He was calling me, telling me.
[03:32:48.280 --> 03:32:50.280]  And I couldn't believe the story.
[03:32:50.280 --> 03:32:51.280]  Well spoken guy.
[03:32:51.280 --> 03:32:54.280]  He was putting two films on one VHS tape.
[03:32:54.280 --> 03:32:56.280]  This was about six years ago.
[03:32:56.280 --> 03:32:59.280]  Ron Paul's neocond speech was about 45 minutes on the floor of
[03:32:59.280 --> 03:33:00.280]  Congress.
[03:33:00.280 --> 03:33:01.280]  Very powerful.
[03:33:01.280 --> 03:33:05.280]  Supposing how there are a bunch of Trotskyites on record, the
[03:33:05.280 --> 03:33:06.280]  main Republican leadership.
[03:33:06.280 --> 03:33:08.280]  I mean, that's really true folks.
[03:33:08.280 --> 03:33:12.280]  Google Trotskyites and neocons.
[03:33:12.280 --> 03:33:14.280]  You'll get Toronto Star Associated Press.
[03:33:14.280 --> 03:33:16.280]  It's very, very sick.
[03:33:16.280 --> 03:33:18.280]  That's how they took conservatives over.
[03:33:18.280 --> 03:33:21.280]  That was the first part in road to tyranny was on the second
[03:33:21.280 --> 03:33:23.280]  part on the slow play on the VHS tapes.
[03:33:23.280 --> 03:33:25.280]  It was about four hours of video on there.
[03:33:25.280 --> 03:33:27.280]  And he gave hundreds of these out in the community.
[03:33:27.280 --> 03:33:30.280]  And back then I was still naive six years ago.
[03:33:30.280 --> 03:33:35.280]  It's not that I didn't believe him, but I got in the phone
[03:33:35.280 --> 03:33:39.280]  book at my house and started calling people with the name
[03:33:39.280 --> 03:33:40.280]  rushing.
[03:33:40.280 --> 03:33:44.280]  And they're like, yeah, no, that's my cousin or no, that's my
[03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:45.280]  brother.
[03:33:45.280 --> 03:33:48.280]  Then I randomly called people on the same streets and they said,
[03:33:48.280 --> 03:33:50.280]  oh, sure, that's a great family here in town.
[03:33:50.280 --> 03:33:52.280]  Kelly's a wonderful, upstanding member of the community and
[03:33:52.280 --> 03:33:53.280]  church and everything.
[03:33:53.280 --> 03:33:55.280]  And I'd say, have you heard about his arrest?
[03:33:55.280 --> 03:33:58.280]  Yes, we saw it in the paper and I went in the paper.
[03:33:58.280 --> 03:34:01.280]  And so then I went and looked that up.
[03:34:01.280 --> 03:34:06.280]  And there it was in the lion County paper that he saw a
[03:34:06.280 --> 03:34:10.280]  state police officer and drove up to him and said, sir, this
[03:34:10.280 --> 03:34:12.280]  is a video about what's happened in our country.
[03:34:12.280 --> 03:34:16.280]  And the police officer that was then found his address off of
[03:34:16.280 --> 03:34:18.280]  his license plate and his name.
[03:34:18.280 --> 03:34:22.280]  When he pulled out of his house, got him arrested him, put him
[03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:24.280]  in the back, called his wife and laughed and said, I have the
[03:34:24.280 --> 03:34:25.280]  VHS bandit with me.
[03:34:25.280 --> 03:34:27.280]  And Kelly said, why are you doing this?
[03:34:27.280 --> 03:34:29.280]  And he said, that's an anti law enforcement video.
[03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:31.280]  You're not allowed to give that out in America.
[03:34:31.280 --> 03:34:33.280]  And I couldn't believe this.
[03:34:33.280 --> 03:34:36.280]  This was in the paper and they charged him.
[03:34:36.280 --> 03:34:41.280]  They charged him two different counts.
[03:34:41.280 --> 03:34:43.280]  The Ron Paul video, he was charged.
[03:34:43.280 --> 03:34:47.280]  You're not allowed to give people a video of C-Span.
[03:34:47.280 --> 03:34:51.280]  I mean, this happened and he was charged for terroristic
[03:34:51.280 --> 03:34:53.280]  threats for that and terroristic threats against law
[03:34:53.280 --> 03:34:56.280]  enforcement for road to tyranny that has no threats in it.
[03:34:56.280 --> 03:35:01.280]  And I got the judge's number, called his home, had it on
[03:35:01.280 --> 03:35:03.280]  speaker, my wife's sitting there so the judge didn't make
[03:35:03.280 --> 03:35:05.280]  something up and I said, hello, sir, hello, your honor.
[03:35:05.280 --> 03:35:06.280]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:35:06.280 --> 03:35:07.280]  I'm a radio talk show host.
[03:35:07.280 --> 03:35:08.280]  I saw this in the newspaper.
[03:35:08.280 --> 03:35:13.280]  Is it true that I've since seen this countless times that you
[03:35:13.280 --> 03:35:16.280]  arrested Kelly rushing and next week is his trial and that
[03:35:16.280 --> 03:35:19.280]  you're going to have this trial go forward, a jury trial and
[03:35:19.280 --> 03:35:21.280]  he's facing five years in prison.
[03:35:21.280 --> 03:35:23.280]  He said, yes, but I'm not going to talk about the trial with
[03:35:23.280 --> 03:35:24.280]  you.
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:29.280]  It went to trial and he was found not guilty by the jury.
[03:35:29.280 --> 03:35:31.280]  They weren't that brainwashed.
[03:35:31.280 --> 03:35:34.280]  And then a week later he was driving home and the police
[03:35:34.280 --> 03:35:35.280]  pulled him over.
[03:35:35.280 --> 03:35:36.280]  By the way, he didn't drink.
[03:35:36.280 --> 03:35:38.280]  They laughed at him.
[03:35:38.280 --> 03:35:40.280]  The state police didn't say, we're arresting you for
[03:35:40.280 --> 03:35:41.280]  drinking.
[03:35:41.280 --> 03:35:43.280]  These are warped individuals, folks, warped.
[03:35:43.280 --> 03:35:46.280]  And I had the footage in road to tyranny, that very video,
[03:35:46.280 --> 03:35:50.280]  where state police in Virginia in a rural area pull over
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:35:54.280]  Abbey Newman, naval veteran, no criminal record in town buying
[03:35:54.280 --> 03:35:55.280]  canning supplies.
[03:35:55.280 --> 03:35:56.280]  She's at a warrantless checkpoint.
[03:35:56.280 --> 03:35:58.280]  She says, you're not going to search my car without a warrant.
[03:35:58.280 --> 03:36:00.280]  They get her out, put her in handcuffs, open the backup.
[03:36:00.280 --> 03:36:03.280]  They find a patriot games with Harrison Ford.
[03:36:03.280 --> 03:36:04.280]  They get scared of that.
[03:36:04.280 --> 03:36:05.280]  The word patriot scared them.
[03:36:05.280 --> 03:36:07.280]  This is on video.
[03:36:07.280 --> 03:36:09.280]  They find a police state 2000 video.
[03:36:09.280 --> 03:36:12.280]  They get scared and then they find a pocket constitution and
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:16.280]  the state police, it's about two hours into the almost three
[03:36:16.280 --> 03:36:18.280]  hour film, road to tyranny.
[03:36:18.280 --> 03:36:24.280]  They start, they start making, I can't believe she's got this.
[03:36:24.280 --> 03:36:25.280]  Is she allowed?
[03:36:25.280 --> 03:36:26.280]  Do we arrest her?
[03:36:26.280 --> 03:36:30.280]  And the commander comes over and they go, it may be illegal or
[03:36:30.280 --> 03:36:32.280]  she may be allowed to have this.
[03:36:32.280 --> 03:36:35.280]  And they're sitting there on squad car video.
[03:36:35.280 --> 03:36:36.280]  I mean, it's Orwellian.
[03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:38.280]  It's like a joke.
[03:36:38.280 --> 03:36:40.280]  It's absurdist.
[03:36:40.280 --> 03:36:41.280]  Like you're on another planet.
[03:36:41.280 --> 03:36:44.280]  Oh, and I don't know, she's one of them.
[03:36:44.280 --> 03:36:49.280]  And they're like, you're under arrest for a conqueror band.
[03:36:49.280 --> 03:36:52.280]  I mean, they're literally making noises.
[03:36:52.280 --> 03:36:55.280]  Like we got one with a constitution.
[03:36:55.280 --> 03:36:58.280]  It's the scariest thing I've ever seen.
[03:36:58.280 --> 03:37:00.280]  We ought to, we ought to actually cue the video up or the show's
[03:37:00.280 --> 03:37:01.280]  almost over.
[03:37:01.280 --> 03:37:04.280]  I want to go to some calls, but you can't believe it till you
[03:37:04.280 --> 03:37:05.280]  see it.
[03:37:05.280 --> 03:37:08.280]  And they arrested her and charged her and she went to court
[03:37:08.280 --> 03:37:11.280]  and they got up there and said, we got pocket constitutions,
[03:37:11.280 --> 03:37:12.280]  your honor.
[03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:15.280]  The judge is like, this actually happened.
[03:37:15.280 --> 03:37:17.280]  It was like, well, that's what you swear an oath to.
[03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:23.280]  And they threw it out, but not in Lyon County, Kentucky.
[03:37:23.280 --> 03:37:26.280]  I mean, they had the trial.
[03:37:26.280 --> 03:37:28.280]  They'll take your property.
[03:37:28.280 --> 03:37:30.280]  They'll take your guns in a minute, folks.
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:32.280]  I mean, they are ready to go after the American people.
[03:37:32.280 --> 03:37:34.280]  Now there are a lot of cops that are salt to the earth and aren't
[03:37:34.280 --> 03:37:37.280]  like that, but more and more, they're just lunatics.
[03:37:37.280 --> 03:37:38.280]  I mean, nuttiered in the fruit cake.
[03:37:38.280 --> 03:37:41.280]  So, so what does your supervisor do to you?
[03:37:41.280 --> 03:37:44.280]  Or is that caller already gone in Arizona?
[03:37:44.280 --> 03:37:47.280]  Christopher, tell us exactly what happened.
[03:37:47.280 --> 03:37:50.280]  So, I mean, did your supervisors, is he going to fire you?
[03:37:50.280 --> 03:37:52.280]  Or are you not allowed to have free speech?
[03:37:52.280 --> 03:37:54.280]  I mean, what's going on?
[03:37:54.280 --> 03:37:55.280]  No, nothing like that.
[03:37:55.280 --> 03:37:59.280]  Well, one, you know, first of all, that agent, he didn't have,
[03:37:59.280 --> 03:38:04.280]  you know, the sense of courage and duty to question me himself.
[03:38:04.280 --> 03:38:06.280]  He just, you know, like a little coward, you know,
[03:38:06.280 --> 03:38:08.280]  a little tail between the legs called my shop, you know,
[03:38:08.280 --> 03:38:09.280]  and I never saw him.
[03:38:09.280 --> 03:38:13.280]  I didn't even know he was behind me, but it was just,
[03:38:13.280 --> 03:38:15.280]  my supervisor, he was cool about it.
[03:38:15.280 --> 03:38:16.280]  You know, he just said.
[03:38:16.280 --> 03:38:17.280]  So, what agent?
[03:38:17.280 --> 03:38:21.280]  I mean, an agent of what called you?
[03:38:21.280 --> 03:38:25.280]  I'm not sure what he was, but it's some type of federal investigator.
[03:38:25.280 --> 03:38:28.280]  They come on post, you know, every now and then to do,
[03:38:28.280 --> 03:38:30.280]  you know, their little investigation, whatever they do.
[03:38:30.280 --> 03:38:32.280]  I'm not sure.
[03:38:32.280 --> 03:38:34.280]  Well, let me just add to that.
[03:38:34.280 --> 03:38:38.280]  I mean, let me just add to that.
[03:38:38.280 --> 03:38:42.280]  They are now teaching police and military that even American flag
[03:38:42.280 --> 03:38:44.280]  bumper stickers are bad.
[03:38:44.280 --> 03:38:46.280]  Did you see that in the Mic report?
[03:38:46.280 --> 03:38:47.280]  I've read that about that.
[03:38:47.280 --> 03:38:48.280]  Yes.
[03:38:48.280 --> 03:38:50.280]  I mean, you can't make this up.
[03:38:50.280 --> 03:38:51.280]  It's disgusting.
[03:38:51.280 --> 03:38:53.280]  Well, they would just love to arrest you.
[03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:56.280]  I mean, they've, they've, they've just, they're scum.
[03:38:56.280 --> 03:38:59.280]  That's why I, you know, I rarely go over the speed limit
[03:38:59.280 --> 03:39:01.280]  because once they get in that system, you're there
[03:39:01.280 --> 03:39:06.280]  and you can't get out, you know, without a hard, hard struggle.
[03:39:06.280 --> 03:39:07.280]  Absolutely.
[03:39:07.280 --> 03:39:08.280]  I appreciate it.
[03:39:08.280 --> 03:39:09.280]  Go ahead.
[03:39:09.280 --> 03:39:14.280]  Well, I just wanted to point out a ban to you that, you know,
[03:39:14.280 --> 03:39:16.280]  you might play on your show during the intermissions.
[03:39:16.280 --> 03:39:17.280]  Okay.
[03:39:17.280 --> 03:39:19.280]  It's a metal ban.
[03:39:19.280 --> 03:39:21.280]  You ever hear a fear factory?
[03:39:21.280 --> 03:39:22.280]  No, I haven't.
[03:39:22.280 --> 03:39:23.280]  I want to check it out.
[03:39:23.280 --> 03:39:24.280]  Thank you, Christopher.
[03:39:24.280 --> 03:39:25.280]  I appreciate your call.
[03:39:25.280 --> 03:39:27.280]  Justin in California, we got to move quick now.
[03:39:27.280 --> 03:39:28.280]  I'm long winded.
[03:39:28.280 --> 03:39:29.280]  Justin, go ahead.
[03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:30.280]  Hello there.
[03:39:30.280 --> 03:39:32.280]  I saw your iPad mental video.
[03:39:32.280 --> 03:39:33.280]  You're right.
[03:39:33.280 --> 03:39:35.280]  You're going to have millions of viewers on that one.
[03:39:35.280 --> 03:39:38.280]  We've talked before, I'm a fellow broadcaster here.
[03:39:38.280 --> 03:39:40.280]  A couple of weeks ago, a thought came into my mind
[03:39:40.280 --> 03:39:42.280]  and I got to tell you, I was delighted yesterday
[03:39:42.280 --> 03:39:44.280]  when I heard you say that there's a war going on
[03:39:44.280 --> 03:39:46.280]  between truth and lies.
[03:39:46.280 --> 03:39:48.280]  If you'll bear with me for 90 seconds, I've got something
[03:39:48.280 --> 03:39:50.280]  that was given to me, I'll share with you.
[03:39:50.280 --> 03:39:51.280]  Here we go.
[03:39:51.280 --> 03:39:52.280]  Go ahead.
[03:39:52.280 --> 03:39:54.280]  Even though I'm against overtaxing the people of America,
[03:39:54.280 --> 03:39:57.280]  I've come up with a tax that will not only save America,
[03:39:57.280 --> 03:39:59.280]  but it'll change the whole world for the better
[03:39:59.280 --> 03:40:00.280]  when initiated globally.
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:03.280]  I call it the truth tax.
[03:40:03.280 --> 03:40:07.280]  The truth tax will be focused only on the mentally corrupt politicians.
[03:40:07.280 --> 03:40:10.280]  This new tax would demand a $10,000 truth tax fee
[03:40:10.280 --> 03:40:13.280]  be paid by all local, state, and federal government officials
[03:40:13.280 --> 03:40:17.280]  and their representatives every time they knowingly tell a lie
[03:40:17.280 --> 03:40:19.280]  to the citizens of America.
[03:40:19.280 --> 03:40:22.280]  Now, I know without any doubt when the truth tax is initiated
[03:40:22.280 --> 03:40:24.280]  with a one-year retroactive rule
[03:40:24.280 --> 03:40:27.280]  that instantly the truth tax would accumulate enough money
[03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:29.280]  to pay off all of the $28 trillion debt
[03:40:29.280 --> 03:40:32.280]  our political leaders have created using lies
[03:40:32.280 --> 03:40:35.280]  to steal the wealth of the citizens of America.
[03:40:35.280 --> 03:40:37.280]  Now, a new collection agency will need to be created
[03:40:37.280 --> 03:40:40.280]  called the GEA, or Get Even Agents.
[03:40:40.280 --> 03:40:43.280]  It will be used to monitor and collect the truth tax
[03:40:43.280 --> 03:40:45.280]  from deceptive politicians.
[03:40:45.280 --> 03:40:49.280]  The GEA team should be created by hiring homeless veterans
[03:40:49.280 --> 03:40:52.280]  and training them to monitor and find the very same politicians
[03:40:52.280 --> 03:40:55.280]  who shoved them into unauthorized wars
[03:40:55.280 --> 03:40:58.280]  and left real American heroes homeless on the streets.
[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:00.280]  Please email all government reps
[03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:02.280]  and take the time to send a letter to all of them
[03:41:02.280 --> 03:41:05.280]  with Tell the Truth written on the outside of the letter.
[03:41:05.280 --> 03:41:07.280]  If we all send letters through the mail
[03:41:07.280 --> 03:41:09.280]  with Tell the Truth written on them,
[03:41:09.280 --> 03:41:12.280]  we will fill up the mailrooms of all government reps
[03:41:12.280 --> 03:41:14.280]  and they'll get a clear message for that
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:17.280]  the American people demand the truth from our government now.
[03:41:17.280 --> 03:41:19.280]  The truth tax, when initiated,
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:21.280]  will save America from falling into hell.
[03:41:21.280 --> 03:41:24.280]  All Americans must demand the truth tax now.
[03:41:24.280 --> 03:41:26.280]  So please contact your local representatives
[03:41:26.280 --> 03:41:28.280]  and demand they add the truth tax
[03:41:28.280 --> 03:41:30.280]  to their next new tax law initiative
[03:41:30.280 --> 03:41:32.280]  and warn them that if they don't,
[03:41:32.280 --> 03:41:35.280]  no new taxes will be paid by the American people.
[03:41:35.280 --> 03:41:37.280]  Justin, great points.
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:38.280]  I appreciate your call.
[03:41:38.280 --> 03:41:40.280]  I would just add, I mean, it's a good idea
[03:41:40.280 --> 03:41:43.280]  and it's also a good illustration of how much they lie.
[03:41:43.280 --> 03:41:45.280]  But don't give them ideas.
[03:41:45.280 --> 03:41:47.280]  The government will create its own truth commission
[03:41:47.280 --> 03:41:50.280]  and arrest us for saying global warming isn't real
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:52.280]  and put taxes on us.
[03:41:52.280 --> 03:41:55.280]  Or they'll arrest Ron Paul
[03:41:55.280 --> 03:41:57.280]  or put taxes on him.
[03:41:57.280 --> 03:41:58.280]  See, that's how it works.
[03:41:58.280 --> 03:42:01.280]  They judge, they set up the phony panels.
[03:42:01.280 --> 03:42:03.280]  Like if you say the sky is blue,
[03:42:03.280 --> 03:42:05.280]  they'll put a $10,000 fine on you and say,
[03:42:05.280 --> 03:42:07.280]  no, you don't see a blue sky.
[03:42:07.280 --> 03:42:11.280]  The government says it's red.
[03:42:11.280 --> 03:42:13.280]  But no, I mean, that's a great idea.
[03:42:13.280 --> 03:42:15.280]  Justin, I appreciate your call.
[03:42:15.280 --> 03:42:18.280]  Oh, by the way, another program note here.
[03:42:18.280 --> 03:42:20.280]  If you just tuned in, you're a radio listener
[03:42:20.280 --> 03:42:23.280]  and not a PrisonPlanet.tv viewer.
[03:42:23.280 --> 03:42:25.280]  And you want to be able to see, you know,
[03:42:25.280 --> 03:42:27.280]  unedited in one piece,
[03:42:27.280 --> 03:42:31.280]  the torture of an iPad,
[03:42:31.280 --> 03:42:34.280]  psychological test, group psychology test.
[03:42:34.280 --> 03:42:37.280]  It's up on infowars.com right now.
[03:42:37.280 --> 03:42:38.280]  It just went up.
[03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:41.280]  It just went live at YouTube.
[03:42:41.280 --> 03:42:44.280]  And it's important to take that link from infowars.com
[03:42:44.280 --> 03:42:45.280]  and prisonplanet.com.
[03:42:45.280 --> 03:42:47.280]  It's posted both places now.
[03:42:47.280 --> 03:42:49.280]  And get it out to everyone you know
[03:42:49.280 --> 03:42:51.280]  because they'll see somebody tortures an iPad.
[03:42:51.280 --> 03:42:54.280]  There's all this big hype and hysteria over iPad.
[03:42:54.280 --> 03:42:56.280]  And all these people that don't care about the truth
[03:42:56.280 --> 03:43:01.280]  of the patriot movement, they may get
[03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:03.280]  into looking at this information
[03:43:03.280 --> 03:43:05.280]  and start thinking about the real world
[03:43:05.280 --> 03:43:06.280]  what's really happening.
[03:43:06.280 --> 03:43:08.280]  We may get a lot of people out of the matrix
[03:43:08.280 --> 03:43:09.280]  with this video.
[03:43:09.280 --> 03:43:11.280]  Just one more salvo, one more idea,
[03:43:11.280 --> 03:43:13.280]  one more action we've taken.
[03:43:13.280 --> 03:43:15.280]  As I torture the iPad to death,
[03:43:15.280 --> 03:43:18.280]  find out why I did it at infowars.com.
[03:43:18.280 --> 03:43:20.280]  If you just joined us at infowars.com,
[03:43:20.280 --> 03:43:23.280]  it'll be up today, tomorrow, throughout the weekend.
[03:43:23.280 --> 03:43:26.280]  infowars.com, send it to the media
[03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:28.280]  and then ask the media,
[03:43:28.280 --> 03:43:30.280]  why did you get upset over the torture of an iPad
[03:43:30.280 --> 03:43:32.280]  but not torture of children?
[03:43:32.280 --> 03:43:35.280]  So the torture of an iPad, I tortured one to death
[03:43:35.280 --> 03:43:37.280]  yesterday here in my office.
[03:43:37.280 --> 03:43:40.280]  Will I be arrested? Who knows?
[03:43:40.280 --> 03:43:43.280]  So the torture of an iPad, infowars.com,
[03:43:43.280 --> 03:43:44.280]  you want to read the article about it
[03:43:44.280 --> 03:43:47.280]  and watch the video in one piece and share it.
[03:43:47.280 --> 03:43:50.280]  We've got a bet going here in the office.
[03:43:50.280 --> 03:43:51.280]  I don't do a lot of wage earning,
[03:43:51.280 --> 03:43:54.280]  but we did have a pool of $20
[03:43:54.280 --> 03:43:55.280]  with the guys last night.
[03:43:55.280 --> 03:43:57.280]  Anybody else wants to get involved here in the office,
[03:43:57.280 --> 03:43:58.280]  by the way, can.
[03:43:58.280 --> 03:44:01.280]  I'm guessing in seven days it'll have 400,000 views.
[03:44:01.280 --> 03:44:05.280]  It's whoever gets closest, numerically.
[03:44:05.280 --> 03:44:07.280]  And that could be below or above.
[03:44:07.280 --> 03:44:08.280]  It's not like the price is right.
[03:44:08.280 --> 03:44:09.280]  It could just be whoever's the closest.
[03:44:09.280 --> 03:44:13.280]  I said 400,000, some said a million, some said a 200,000.
[03:44:13.280 --> 03:44:15.280]  But we'll see.
[03:44:15.280 --> 03:44:17.280]  Seven days from now, from the time this was launched
[03:44:17.280 --> 03:44:21.280]  at about 240 or so central time,
[03:44:21.280 --> 03:44:25.280]  until next Thursday at this same time,
[03:44:25.280 --> 03:44:27.280]  we will see who is going to win this.
[03:44:27.280 --> 03:44:29.280]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lynn in Oregon.
[03:44:29.280 --> 03:44:31.280]  You're on the year. Go ahead.
[03:44:31.280 --> 03:44:32.280]  Howdy, Alex.
[03:44:32.280 --> 03:44:33.280]  Hi.
[03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:34.280]  Hi, Emma.
[03:44:34.280 --> 03:44:36.280]  Well, I'll try to go fast.
[03:44:36.280 --> 03:44:39.280]  I'm a seven generation Texan here, stuck in Oregon.
[03:44:39.280 --> 03:44:41.280]  And what we have a problem with here is that
[03:44:41.280 --> 03:44:45.280]  it's kind of hard to align with very liberal areas.
[03:44:45.280 --> 03:44:48.280]  And we're trying to find ways to try to get out
[03:44:48.280 --> 03:44:52.280]  and connect with other people that are more liberal,
[03:44:52.280 --> 03:44:54.280]  but we can align with them.
[03:44:54.280 --> 03:44:58.280]  And where we can align with them is on the drug war.
[03:44:58.280 --> 03:45:01.280]  And what we've done here in this area,
[03:45:01.280 --> 03:45:06.280]  we've just gotten a booth at the Global Canvas March
[03:45:06.280 --> 03:45:11.280]  that Oregon Normal is throwing in downtown Portland
[03:45:11.280 --> 03:45:14.280]  at a Pioneer Courthouse Courtyard Square.
[03:45:14.280 --> 03:45:17.280]  And what we've done is we've burned over about 150 copies
[03:45:17.280 --> 03:45:21.280]  of how the weed won the West and the American drug war.
[03:45:21.280 --> 03:45:25.280]  And we're going to be giving out those CDs at that March.
[03:45:25.280 --> 03:45:30.280]  And then hopefully we can connect with the more liberal people.
[03:45:30.280 --> 03:45:32.280]  You need to just reach out to them and say,
[03:45:32.280 --> 03:45:34.280]  liberal conservative is a controlled paradigm.
[03:45:34.280 --> 03:45:35.280]  Wake up.
[03:45:35.280 --> 03:45:39.280]  The health care plan is nothing but a payoff to big corporations.
[03:45:39.280 --> 03:45:41.280]  And it's good that that news is getting out,
[03:45:41.280 --> 03:45:44.280]  because even mainline pundits are now having to admit that.
[03:45:44.280 --> 03:45:46.280]  Very exciting land, good to hear from you.
[03:45:46.280 --> 03:45:50.280]  Brian in Canada who disagrees, go ahead, Brian.
[03:45:50.280 --> 03:45:52.280]  Colorado, yeah.
[03:45:52.280 --> 03:45:54.280]  The name varies so Toro.
[03:45:54.280 --> 03:45:58.280]  I disagree with using that name, and I'll tell you why.
[03:45:58.280 --> 03:46:02.280]  Do you know what name he graduated by?
[03:46:02.280 --> 03:46:04.280]  No.
[03:46:04.280 --> 03:46:07.280]  Barry Obama, and he went to Punahou High School.
[03:46:07.280 --> 03:46:10.280]  I also believe I know his CIA name.
[03:46:10.280 --> 03:46:13.280]  Did he not work in the CIA?
[03:46:13.280 --> 03:46:15.280]  Well, Reverend Manning says he has that evidence.
[03:46:15.280 --> 03:46:16.280]  And by the way, I've been saying for two weeks,
[03:46:16.280 --> 03:46:17.280]  I want to get Reverend Manning back on.
[03:46:17.280 --> 03:46:19.280]  I'll see him on next week.
[03:46:19.280 --> 03:46:21.280]  Tarpley says there's a lot of evidence of that,
[03:46:21.280 --> 03:46:23.280]  but he's had a bunch of different names.
[03:46:23.280 --> 03:46:25.280]  And yes, I did know about the Barry Obama name
[03:46:25.280 --> 03:46:27.280]  he also used on the diploma.
[03:46:27.280 --> 03:46:29.280]  I just wasn't specific which graduation.
[03:46:29.280 --> 03:46:31.280]  I think he has three degrees.
[03:46:31.280 --> 03:46:34.280]  But we know when he was adopted, it was Barry Sitaro.
[03:46:34.280 --> 03:46:37.280]  And that makes him ineligible to be president.
[03:46:37.280 --> 03:46:39.280]  Clearly he was born in Kenya as well.
[03:46:39.280 --> 03:46:42.280]  But we can't 100% prove that.
[03:46:42.280 --> 03:46:44.280]  But we know he's an Indonesian citizen,
[03:46:44.280 --> 03:46:46.280]  and his name is Barry Sitaro.
[03:46:46.280 --> 03:46:48.280]  Hence, we're putting that info out.
[03:46:48.280 --> 03:46:52.280]  Well, okay, now let me tell you what I think his last name is
[03:46:52.280 --> 03:46:57.280]  because I ran into someone that's, you know what G2 is?
[03:46:57.280 --> 03:47:00.280]  Well, that's a clearance level in the government.
[03:47:00.280 --> 03:47:02.280]  G2 is counterintelligence.
[03:47:02.280 --> 03:47:04.280]  Yeah.
[03:47:04.280 --> 03:47:10.280]  This guy is in G2 not knowing who he was talking to.
[03:47:10.280 --> 03:47:11.280]  He spilled the beans.
[03:47:11.280 --> 03:47:14.280]  And I'm going to expose the name on Tax Day
[03:47:14.280 --> 03:47:16.280]  because what better day is there?
[03:47:16.280 --> 03:47:17.280]  Okay, expose it.
[03:47:17.280 --> 03:47:21.280]  B-O-E-H-M-E-R, Bomer.
[03:47:21.280 --> 03:47:23.280]  Now, I did not get the first name.
[03:47:23.280 --> 03:47:26.280]  He said, I saw a document with that name on it.
[03:47:26.280 --> 03:47:27.280]  And I said, what document?
[03:47:27.280 --> 03:47:29.280]  He says, why are you interrogating me?
[03:47:29.280 --> 03:47:31.280]  I said, I'm not interrogating you.
[03:47:31.280 --> 03:47:33.280]  I just wondered what the document was.
[03:47:33.280 --> 03:47:34.280]  All right.
[03:47:34.280 --> 03:47:35.280]  I don't like to speculate.
[03:47:35.280 --> 03:47:38.280]  We'll try to flesh that out and send us an email about it.
[03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:39.280]  Sure.
[03:47:39.280 --> 03:47:41.280]  We know his name is Barry Sitaro on record.
[03:47:41.280 --> 03:47:43.280]  We know he's an Indonesian citizen.
[03:47:43.280 --> 03:47:44.280]  Done.
[03:47:44.280 --> 03:47:45.280]  Case closed.
[03:47:49.280 --> 03:47:51.280]  Final segment on Tax Day.
[03:47:51.280 --> 03:47:55.280]  We'll be back live tomorrow at 1InfoWars.com.
[03:47:55.280 --> 03:47:58.280]  iPad, torture to death, and psychological experiment.
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:01.280]  And hey, I did this last year.
[03:48:01.280 --> 03:48:02.280]  It's now something we do.
[03:48:02.280 --> 03:48:05.280]  I've lost my shirt to the Internal Revenue Service.
[03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:06.280]  I know it's illegal.
[03:48:06.280 --> 03:48:07.280]  Unlawful.
[03:48:07.280 --> 03:48:08.280]  Didn't have it until 1913.
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:10.280]  Goes to the private bankers.
[03:48:10.280 --> 03:48:12.280]  You can zoom down a little bit more, boys.
[03:48:12.280 --> 03:48:14.280]  And look, I'm not wearing a shirt here.
[03:48:14.280 --> 03:48:17.280]  I don't have a shirt on.
[03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:21.280]  In fact, the government can have my watch as well.
[03:48:21.280 --> 03:48:22.280]  Here.
[03:48:22.280 --> 03:48:23.280]  Here.
[03:48:23.280 --> 03:48:24.280]  For the private bankers.
[03:48:24.280 --> 03:48:25.280]  It's all yours.
[03:48:25.280 --> 03:48:26.280]  Here.
[03:48:26.280 --> 03:48:27.280]  My boots.
[03:48:27.280 --> 03:48:28.280]  I mean, it's even worse than last year.
[03:48:28.280 --> 03:48:29.280]  And the taxes are all going up.
[03:48:29.280 --> 03:48:30.280]  It's all yours.
[03:48:30.280 --> 03:48:31.280]  You can have it all.
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:33.280]  Enjoy it, parasites.
[03:48:33.280 --> 03:48:34.280]  You own me.
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:35.280]  I'm your slave.
[03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:37.280]  And now under health care, they own my body.
[03:48:37.280 --> 03:48:39.280]  They get to decide what type of health care I get.
[03:48:39.280 --> 03:48:41.280]  And they're trying to push force inoculation
[03:48:41.280 --> 03:48:43.280]  with the whole swine flu hysteria
[03:48:43.280 --> 03:48:45.280]  that they can force things in my body.
[03:48:45.280 --> 03:48:49.280]  So I guess you don't just own my clothes
[03:48:49.280 --> 03:48:52.280]  and my watch and my wallet and my bank account,
[03:48:52.280 --> 03:48:53.280]  but you own my body.
[03:48:53.280 --> 03:48:55.280]  You own my labor that my body creates,
[03:48:55.280 --> 03:48:56.280]  that my mind creates.
[03:48:56.280 --> 03:48:57.280]  I'm a serf.
[03:48:57.280 --> 03:48:58.280]  I'm a slave.
[03:48:58.280 --> 03:48:59.280]  I don't want to be.
[03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:02.280]  I'm reclaiming my liberty.
[03:49:02.280 --> 03:49:05.280]  I'm reclaiming my freedom.
[03:49:05.280 --> 03:49:08.280]  And all of us need to do that.
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:09.280]  We will be premiering the new film,
[03:49:09.280 --> 03:49:12.280]  Visible Empire at prisonplanet.tv
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:14.280]  in about T minus five minutes.
[03:49:14.280 --> 03:49:18.280]  It's going up there right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:49:18.280 --> 03:49:20.280]  I guess let's go ahead and end this
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:23.280]  with a couple more phone calls.
[03:49:23.280 --> 03:49:26.280]  Let's talk to Mark in New Mexico.
[03:49:26.280 --> 03:49:30.280]  Mark, you're on the air.
[03:49:30.280 --> 03:49:34.280]  Okay, Max in California.
[03:49:34.280 --> 03:49:36.280]  Go ahead, Max.
[03:49:36.280 --> 03:49:38.280]  Hi, Alex.
[03:49:38.280 --> 03:49:40.280]  I've been watching your videos.
[03:49:40.280 --> 03:49:42.280]  How do you hear anything about
[03:49:42.280 --> 03:49:46.280]  Australian government merging with another government?
[03:49:46.280 --> 03:49:48.280]  How is that possible?
[03:49:48.280 --> 03:49:52.280]  They have a pretty large size, you know, land,
[03:49:52.280 --> 03:49:55.280]  and nothing happening with that country.
[03:49:55.280 --> 03:49:58.280]  Again?
[03:49:58.280 --> 03:50:02.280]  I'm talking about Australian government.
[03:50:02.280 --> 03:50:06.280]  How come Australian government does not get involved
[03:50:06.280 --> 03:50:10.280]  in any, you know, emerging, you know...
[03:50:10.280 --> 03:50:12.280]  Well, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:50:12.280 --> 03:50:14.280]  They're part of the Asian Union.
[03:50:14.280 --> 03:50:16.280]  They're taking most of the farmers and ranchers' property
[03:50:16.280 --> 03:50:18.280]  just outright for carbon taxes.
[03:50:18.280 --> 03:50:20.280]  They confiscated most of the guns.
[03:50:20.280 --> 03:50:21.280]  They're passing hate speech laws.
[03:50:21.280 --> 03:50:23.280]  They're passing one of the most draconian
[03:50:23.280 --> 03:50:25.280]  internet censorship laws.
[03:50:25.280 --> 03:50:28.280]  Australia is part of the British Commonwealth.
[03:50:28.280 --> 03:50:32.280]  In 79, their parliament said no to the New World Order.
[03:50:32.280 --> 03:50:35.280]  So the Queen had her Governor-General come in
[03:50:35.280 --> 03:50:37.280]  and vetoed them.
[03:50:37.280 --> 03:50:40.280]  That's happened twice in the last three years in Canada.
[03:50:40.280 --> 03:50:43.280]  Australia is descending into a New World Order pit.
[03:50:43.280 --> 03:50:45.280]  Okay, so I have to disagree with you.
[03:50:45.280 --> 03:50:48.280]  No, Australia is deeply involved with the New World Order.
[03:50:48.280 --> 03:50:51.280]  Every country in the world is either under New Order control
[03:50:51.280 --> 03:50:53.280]  or they're being bombarded and invaded
[03:50:53.280 --> 03:50:55.280]  or sanctioned or attacked.
[03:50:55.280 --> 03:50:57.280]  That means countries that aren't part of the New Order
[03:50:57.280 --> 03:50:59.280]  are good either. Most governments are bad.
[03:50:59.280 --> 03:51:02.280]  It's just they're not part of the big mega eugenics
[03:51:02.280 --> 03:51:05.280]  New World Order, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:51:05.280 --> 03:51:08.280]  And for all of you out there that don't realize
[03:51:08.280 --> 03:51:11.280]  that even if you don't pay high-income taxes,
[03:51:11.280 --> 03:51:14.280]  you don't get paid as much because your bosses are.
[03:51:14.280 --> 03:51:17.280]  And you're paying Social Security that you're never going to collect.
[03:51:17.280 --> 03:51:19.280]  And now they've got the value-added tax they want
[03:51:19.280 --> 03:51:21.280]  and the carbon taxes that will hit everybody
[03:51:21.280 --> 03:51:23.280]  and all the other hundreds of hidden taxes.
[03:51:23.280 --> 03:51:25.280]  So remember that on tax day.
[03:51:25.280 --> 03:51:27.280]  You know, I am flat out of time.
[03:51:27.280 --> 03:51:29.280]  I just want to say great job to the whole crew
[03:51:29.280 --> 03:51:32.280]  that helped me shoot the torture of the iPad yesterday
[03:51:32.280 --> 03:51:34.280]  that's really going to educate a lot of people.
[03:51:34.280 --> 03:51:36.280]  If you want to find out what we're talking about,
[03:51:36.280 --> 03:51:38.280]  go see it at infowars.com.
[03:51:38.280 --> 03:51:40.280]  I want to thank the great crew that helped us produce and make
[03:51:40.280 --> 03:51:42.280]  with Jason Bermas and Visible Empire.
[03:51:42.280 --> 03:51:44.280]  A New Order to find. You can order the DVD right now.
[03:51:44.280 --> 03:51:46.280]  It's now shipping out.
[03:51:46.280 --> 03:51:48.280]  Get the expanded extras on the high-quality DVD.
[03:51:48.280 --> 03:51:50.280]  I just want to thank everybody that's been so supportive
[03:51:50.280 --> 03:51:52.280]  of this radio show.
[03:51:52.280 --> 03:51:54.280]  And of all the work we do in the news,
[03:51:54.280 --> 03:51:58.280]  websites, prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[03:51:58.280 --> 03:52:00.280]  I want to say great job to the IT crew.
[03:52:00.280 --> 03:52:04.280]  Great job to everybody in there in the control room,
[03:52:04.280 --> 03:52:06.280]  to all of our supporters, our AM and FM affiliates,
[03:52:06.280 --> 03:52:08.280]  Global Shore Wave Satellite,
[03:52:08.280 --> 03:52:11.280]  and of course our sponsors, just everyone.
[03:52:11.280 --> 03:52:13.280]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[03:52:13.280 --> 03:52:15.280]  The truth is rising.
[03:52:15.280 --> 03:52:17.280]  The globalists have been exposed.
[03:52:17.280 --> 03:52:19.280]  They're false flags.
[03:52:19.280 --> 03:52:21.280]  They just credit the tea parties that have been exposed.
[03:52:21.280 --> 03:52:23.280]  We'll have a lot more news on that tomorrow.
[03:52:23.280 --> 03:52:48.280]  And Visible Empire premieres.
