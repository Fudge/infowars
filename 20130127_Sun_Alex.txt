[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  We've got it
[00:07.400 --> 00:09.520]  Waging war on corruption
[00:11.360 --> 00:17.440]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war
[00:17.440 --> 00:32.080]  We only value liberty and freedom when it's under assault when we're losing it that's the old cliche
[00:32.080 --> 00:38.560]  you don't know what you've got until it's gone and so the good news is there are many different
[00:38.560 --> 00:45.800]  tracks in human history the good the bad the ugly and many others there are different competing
[00:45.800 --> 00:57.040]  forces in this world the problem is evil so often is very highly organized but over the weekend and
[00:57.040 --> 01:04.960]  it's been a process we talked about this some on Friday I I had more epiphanies and more deep
[01:04.960 --> 01:13.440]  understanding of how the entire system works to the point of almost not even being able to come
[01:13.440 --> 01:21.320]  into this radio show my point is is that I can't just get up here and rattle off facts and
[01:21.320 --> 01:27.760]  statistics and tell you my point of view on this or that we need to have a fundamental discussion
[01:27.760 --> 01:36.720]  about the fact that the real world is verifiable and what's really going on is hiding in the living
[01:36.720 --> 01:46.320]  room like a 10 trillion pound elephant and that so many people that hear about corruption and
[01:46.320 --> 01:52.720]  evil they're prideful they don't want to believe they've been enslaved or they're prideful and say
[01:52.720 --> 01:58.600]  so what there's nothing you can do about it and and think that gives them control over it and I
[01:58.600 --> 02:05.080]  guess it's part of the decadence of the society because we've had it so good for so long but it
[02:05.080 --> 02:16.440]  really hit me this morning and this afternoon harder than anything's ever hit me because the
[02:16.440 --> 02:26.280]  shadows are getting long night is falling over our society and so undoubtedly myself and many of you
[02:26.280 --> 02:39.200]  are gonna get more focused more serious reality and danger has a way of doing that but I had a
[02:39.200 --> 02:44.880]  realization this morning and when I had the realization I knew that I'd always known this
[02:44.880 --> 02:51.600]  and then all of you know this and that when I say this you're gonna say that's no revelation at all
[02:51.600 --> 03:01.400]  but it is a revelation because it's not figurative and it's not a term I would just use to describe
[03:01.400 --> 03:10.000]  something like calling an extremely fat man an elephant or a hippo this is not like calling
[03:10.000 --> 03:16.640]  something something it's not because it describes it this is the thing this thing I will call out
[03:16.640 --> 03:25.120]  is the elephant not the fat man not the freak show it is the elephant it is the bona fide
[03:25.120 --> 03:31.480]  with the tusk and the ears and the big trunk a little tail and it can step on you and it's a
[03:31.480 --> 03:46.400]  very psychotic elephant and what I'm speaking of is royalty royalty and the real discrimination
[03:46.400 --> 03:54.120]  that's going on in our world and the system consciously knows this and is building this
[03:54.120 --> 04:03.440]  and as soon as I had this realization I began to search engine statements and treaties and globalist
[04:03.440 --> 04:09.400]  and I knew what I was going to be able to find before I entered it even though I had never read
[04:09.400 --> 04:17.760]  them saying it and they admit they are consciously building a world government where the ruling class
[04:17.760 --> 04:25.080]  is royal and is exempt from the laws they put us under and they themselves call it the new royalty
[04:28.680 --> 04:34.320]  and that's why they divide and conquer black white old young northern southerner Christian
[04:34.320 --> 04:46.320]  Muslim Jew this that gay straight on and on and on they do that because they are scientifically
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.360]  dividing and conquering and again I know you know that but the point is they are building a world
[04:51.360 --> 04:57.760]  where they are the royalty and I'm gonna break it down coming up with all the latest news stay with
[04:57.760 --> 05:04.120]  us we're live you prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but if you don't have a home security

[06:36.640 --> 06:42.320]  gentlemen thank you for joining us live it is Sunday the 27th day of January
[06:42.320 --> 06:50.080]  2013 and we will be here for the next two hours roughly Lord willing I of course will

[06:57.600 --> 07:06.840]  live or tape delayed also XM 166 again thank you so much for joining us for this important broadcast
[07:06.840 --> 07:13.600]  okay here is what is coming up I'm gonna go over some of the headlines here and then I'm gonna get
[07:13.600 --> 07:22.360]  to the biggest realization and epiphany that I have ever had and again when I go over this
[07:22.360 --> 07:32.640]  awakening this realization wife is a is a roadmap of awakenings or people who live in delusion it is
[07:32.640 --> 07:39.760]  a bottomless pit of ignorance and when I cover this awakening I've had many of you are gonna say
[07:39.760 --> 07:49.360]  tell me something I didn't know and that is in itself the awakening that is in itself the
[07:49.360 --> 07:58.920]  awakening that I already knew this but it hit me and and I can see the social engineers I've
[07:58.920 --> 08:05.960]  read their writings at nauseum read them here on air but I understand the globalist and the social
[08:05.960 --> 08:11.560]  engineers to such a level because I've been intimately studying them for 20 years on air
[08:11.560 --> 08:21.880]  for 17 that I know more I can clearly say than that even most of their top technocrats because
[08:21.880 --> 08:28.880]  most of their technocrats are worldly they're sold out they've used their knowledge to basically just
[08:28.880 --> 08:38.240]  gain power so they are lazy in their research in fact in a way I realized my broadcast is almost a
[08:38.240 --> 08:45.120]  college for people who want to go out and do bad things and be evil that was another a huge
[08:45.120 --> 08:50.840]  awakening I had this weekend because I learned more all the time I learned more in a month now
[08:50.840 --> 08:59.840]  that I learned previously in a year 15 16 years ago my mind has just been burning with understanding
[08:59.840 --> 09:06.160]  the last few months and it is exhausting at a certain level but it's also a great exaltation
[09:06.160 --> 09:14.320]  to be dedicated to something and to and to begin to become a master and as you become a master you
[09:14.320 --> 09:20.400]  realize you're nothing but a first-grade pupil but the universe is just opening up and it is
[09:20.400 --> 09:28.760]  my goal it is my goal to try to really articulate what I know and then to go show you the research
[09:28.760 --> 09:35.400]  I've done and again much of it you're gonna say I already knew that that is really the biggest
[09:35.400 --> 09:43.240]  sector of this constellation of great understandings epiphanies whatever you want to call them
[09:43.240 --> 09:49.680]  widening horizons that I've been having as of late I will tell you that I'll get to this by
[09:49.680 --> 09:56.360]  the bottom of the hour and it's like jumping off a 200-foot cliff and a beautiful Mediterranean
[09:56.360 --> 10:05.880]  Sea it's beautiful but it's also chilling to even try to describe it and I'm not embellishing here
[10:05.880 --> 10:13.880]  building up what I'm saying I I can envision things they're doing now just because I know
[10:13.880 --> 10:18.480]  their mind and then search engine it which is an incredible power it's like a modern crystal ball
[10:18.480 --> 10:26.400]  and find the exact words I was envisioning the enemy engaged in and find them speaking at
[10:26.400 --> 10:34.400]  themselves it's just it's unbelievable and to know who the globalist are and to know what they're
[10:34.400 --> 10:43.080]  into they are really pathetic people to have this knowledge and to not want to give it to people and
[10:43.080 --> 10:47.720]  empower people and instead know that so many smart people have discovered what I've discovered
[10:47.720 --> 10:56.720]  and they just go join the Legion of Evil the Legion of Doom that is a very dark understanding
[10:56.720 --> 11:02.880]  but again they're missing spiritually on some things and they're they're missing out on a
[11:02.880 --> 11:11.040]  loving upbringing and they get a lot of them also were were were sweet people who were abused by a
[11:11.040 --> 11:18.560]  generally barbarous and petty and shallow world and so they then go out and to say well I'll just
[11:18.560 --> 11:24.120]  be dark and corrupt and I'll build a wall around myself that's what Pink Floyd's the wall is all
[11:24.120 --> 11:29.720]  about and then the worms the worms they enter your brain because when you give up your love and your
[11:29.720 --> 11:36.880]  passion your love of creativity and your empathy your soul begins to be shuttered and the prison
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.920]  you build around other people that you believe is protecting you is really a fortress prison
[11:41.920 --> 11:46.720]  you're building around yourself and again I know when I say all this you're gonna say I already
[11:46.720 --> 11:54.680]  knew that but did you know it because that is only one piece in a larger mosaic or just stalled
[11:54.680 --> 11:59.000]  that I will attempt because you know thoughts at the speed of light your thought is at the speed
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.160]  of light you're an incredible creature living on a gorgeous planet hurtling through deep space I
[12:03.160 --> 12:08.480]  mean everything around you is magic consciousness is incredible everything is unspeakably wonderful
[12:08.480 --> 12:15.600]  when you realize the good in the world and then you see the ugly and the ugly is like a malformed
[12:15.600 --> 12:25.720]  malfunctioning injured animal in a ditch flopping around it it no longer is even an enemy until you
[12:25.720 --> 12:33.320]  realize you've been so weak and listen to its siren song so long that you have given yourself
[12:33.320 --> 12:42.960]  over to a subordinate position of this evil so that is what I will attempt to break down at the
[12:42.960 --> 12:51.640]  bottom of the hour as I just promised to do but I will tell you at the core understanding is that
[12:51.640 --> 13:01.080]  royalty is the goal royalty and again we talk about the city-state nations exempt from law the
[13:01.080 --> 13:07.280]  UN exempt from law the diplomatic immunity Congress exempt from insider trading congressman
[13:07.280 --> 13:11.000]  caught raping children it's back in the news they don't get in trouble they're a bunch of
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.720]  Jerry Sandusky's you don't get in the club now at the high levels unless you are all of that is well
[13:16.720 --> 13:22.840]  how do they get away with that they are royal and they consciously are building a royal system Kim
[13:22.840 --> 13:29.360]  Jung ill his father put him in power in North Korea now his son third generation they're now
[13:29.360 --> 13:35.840]  calling him royalty in North Korea they're now saying the Sun comes out and the birds sing
[13:35.840 --> 13:43.360]  because of him another generation or two they will be wearing gold crowns and Americans will
[13:43.360 --> 13:48.720]  pay money to go drive around on yachts with them and pose when they wear red robes and crowns you
[13:48.720 --> 13:59.160]  see the British royalty is 50 or 60 lines of North Korean dictatorship so so we bow down to
[13:59.160 --> 14:07.920]  People magazine and and worship Kate Middleton you see how sick that is and that's what National
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.520]  Security Act is that's what the New World Order is that's what that now they're trying to get
[14:12.520 --> 14:18.040]  countries to sign onto treaties where the six mega banks have diplomatic community I mean
[14:18.040 --> 14:23.880]  diplomatic community ladies and gentlemen you can walk off a plane with a five-year-old child with
[14:23.880 --> 14:27.840]  a chain around their neck and no one can stop them and this is in the back of the news all
[14:27.840 --> 14:33.040]  the time to the point of it even put it the news that often now when the UN gets caught flying US
[14:33.040 --> 14:38.800]  foster children out or flying other kids in it's just a footnote if you're a new listener going
[14:38.800 --> 14:44.200]  that's incredible well you just just go search engine UN caught in sex trafficking UN caught
[14:44.200 --> 14:51.640]  using diplomatic community and no one gets in trouble when the police you know catch some guy
[14:51.640 --> 14:57.400]  in Houston you know running over people diplomatic immunity can't get in trouble you can now purchase
[14:57.400 --> 15:04.120]  from the UN and multiple governments diplomatic immunity you see they're a group of pirates who
[15:04.120 --> 15:10.720]  get so much power through fraud they tell you they're royal they tell you they're exempt they
[15:10.720 --> 15:17.720]  tell you because of their signet ring or their UN seal they're allowed to have a woman chained in
[15:17.720 --> 15:22.600]  their closet as a sex slave in New York and they don't get in trouble they're allowed to kill her
[15:22.600 --> 15:27.800]  chop her up and put her in the trash can when the trash men find the chopped up woman the police say
[15:27.800 --> 15:33.360]  we can't do anything and then used to they would recall people that did that they don't even recall
[15:33.360 --> 15:41.480]  them now you see that's beyond royalty could a king in England 600 years ago killed children
[15:41.480 --> 15:45.920]  just because they wanted to like Jimmy Savelle and all the news with him and the royal family
[15:45.920 --> 15:51.360]  coming out no they had to do it in dungeons quietly now they do it out in the open so that's
[15:51.360 --> 15:56.360]  the big epiphany I'm gonna give you all the documentation on that and more just like they're
[15:56.360 --> 16:03.000]  exempt from the gun laws the Senate Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers
[16:03.000 --> 16:09.480]  the prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse the globalist model
[16:09.480 --> 16:15.800]  is to shut down societies and starve Patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover that's

[21:35.480 --> 21:42.680]  911 not best option urges residents to take firearms lessons you know what there are now
[21:42.680 --> 21:46.200]  hundreds of sheriffs coming out saying they won't enforce things that are unconstitutional
[21:46.200 --> 21:51.160]  a bunch of congress people are saying it state reps are saying it governors are saying it that's
[21:51.160 --> 21:56.840]  the spirit that's the lawful rebellion against this government that's been occupied by foreign
[21:56.840 --> 22:04.840]  powers on record trying to take us back to serfdom and slavery because liberty and freedom is checks
[22:04.840 --> 22:11.560]  and balances on their tyrannical usurpation but i'm noticing a lot of police chiefs a lot of
[22:11.560 --> 22:16.840]  sheriffs a lot of people are saying hey i'm on the people's side i know the government is out
[22:16.840 --> 22:22.840]  of control and hijacked and corrupt in fact congressman brown came out federal congressman
[22:22.840 --> 22:27.640]  and said obama's only loyal to the soviet constitution and is basically part of a foreign
[22:27.640 --> 22:33.640]  takeover newsweek came out and said you bet it's good the communist chinese say we should turn our
[22:33.640 --> 22:39.320]  guns in we're going under globalism they own our debt and alex jones needs to be dealt with that
[22:39.320 --> 22:45.160]  was in an article called piers pressure problem about piers morgan i mean this is this is going
[22:45.160 --> 22:50.520]  on and and the operatives for the system know what they're doing still other police in areas like
[22:50.520 --> 22:57.800]  chicago new york and other places aren't just arresting people that videotape them in public
[22:57.800 --> 23:03.320]  they're now savagely beating them and here's an article at info awards.com photographers viciously
[23:03.320 --> 23:08.920]  attacked a police officer for taking pictures of historical building now federal and state courts
[23:08.920 --> 23:12.360]  have thrown out where they arrest people filming them in public because that's totally legal and
[23:12.360 --> 23:18.120]  lawful there's no perception of privacy 12 states are still arresting people but because the courts
[23:18.120 --> 23:23.400]  are throwing it out they now just beat you savagely uh and that's because the higher ups
[23:23.400 --> 23:30.520]  in the mafia areas that control major sectors of the nation want our will broken i saw an
[23:30.520 --> 23:35.640]  incredible video a million dollar homes nice area very well-dressed women saying you don't have a
[23:35.640 --> 23:39.320]  right to put a smart meter on our house it surveils everything we're doing wirelessly
[23:39.320 --> 23:43.480]  with all the new appliances we have a federal lawsuit this came out in the chicago tribune
[23:43.480 --> 23:48.440]  it's outside chicago and you're not allowed to go over my gate they they climb over the gate the
[23:48.440 --> 23:55.560]  police with the locals the local power company they put the smart meter on the house and then
[23:55.560 --> 24:04.280]  they arrest the woman saying that's eavesdropping to videotape us in your own yard i mean that's
[24:04.280 --> 24:09.080]  north korean style tyranny in fact on that subject here's an article out of the washington post
[24:09.080 --> 24:19.000]  former cia officer john caracal is sentenced to 30 months in prison for leaks you're good at
[24:19.000 --> 24:25.240]  reading names uh in there cj how do you pronounce that caracal caracal i'm pronouncing it right
[24:25.240 --> 24:30.920]  i've seen him in interviews before he went to prison and he exposed cia torture that people
[24:30.920 --> 24:38.680]  went to prison for now now under all common law all u.s law you expose criminal activity
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.320]  to the press anybody you're protected national security doesn't protect that but they still
[24:45.320 --> 24:52.600]  got a kangaroo court sent him to jail now that is royalty right there the government could order
[24:52.600 --> 24:56.360]  torture in some cases of children as young as four years of age in front of their parents
[24:56.360 --> 25:02.120]  with battery acid and large objects i'm not going to go any further but it's joseph mingola did
[25:02.120 --> 25:07.240]  stuff to little kids sexually with large objects that was the nazi known as angel of death
[25:08.760 --> 25:11.800]  and this went on at camps all over the world black sites as they're known
[25:11.800 --> 25:16.360]  the whistle got blown on this and a lot of good people
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.000]  talked about it and exposed it and this fella gave it to well-known press trying to get it stopped
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.840]  and and he did get it stopped well obama got caught running a torture camp in mangazi
[25:31.000 --> 25:34.600]  of course that came out just a few months ago but they had to publicly
[25:35.320 --> 25:39.480]  stop promoting it see they tried to normalize something that's illegal just by saying they
[25:39.480 --> 25:43.800]  were doing it remember rumsfeld bragging about torture and stuff and then when it came out what
[25:43.800 --> 25:47.640]  they were doing they sent their underlings to prison but a whole bunch of people had exposed
[25:47.640 --> 25:55.960]  lies about wmds lies about iraq nukes lies about torture lies about they go to jail now 30 months
[25:55.960 --> 26:03.080]  in jail for exposing something that's illegal that's never happened in our country not with
[26:03.080 --> 26:12.600]  the pentagon papers any of it that is unprecedented you expose children that's how they got khalid
[26:12.600 --> 26:18.280]  sheikh muhammad to confess to bombing things that weren't built until after he was in prison in one
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.680]  case a building built four years after he was in prison he'd been in prison about eight years till
[26:22.680 --> 26:29.640]  he confessed three or four years ago he confessed to everything but crucifying christ and killing
[26:29.640 --> 26:35.800]  lincoln i mean it was incredible and they they threatened to torture his small children in some
[26:35.800 --> 26:42.120]  cases people didn't didn't do what they were told and needless to say they like to rape the kids
[26:42.120 --> 26:46.600]  because that's why they got into this see there's only one place you can rape kids and have the
[26:46.600 --> 26:54.920]  government protect you and that's in these black sites those sites and um it's it's it's unspeakably
[26:54.920 --> 27:00.520]  evil and and america we can't sign on to this okay in the name of fighting terrorists speaking
[27:00.520 --> 27:08.920]  of that i have an incredible uh headline here uh israel let me show tv viewers we're also
[27:08.920 --> 27:15.240]  streaming video and info wars news.com and presentplanet.tv israel threatens serious
[27:15.240 --> 27:20.040]  strike if rebels get chemical arms now the russians are there guarding serious chemical
[27:20.040 --> 27:25.720]  arms asad's not an angel but compared to al-qaeda he is the west nato the us and france and others
[27:25.720 --> 27:31.560]  have put al-qaeda in in the last 22 months that's now declassified to attack and try to overthrow
[27:31.560 --> 27:37.000]  the the asad regime now they're saying the u.s is saying this as well they may attack
[27:37.000 --> 27:38.920]  they may attack
[27:42.200 --> 27:48.120]  this is so amazing i can't believe this is reuters they may attack damascus because they don't want
[27:48.120 --> 27:53.480]  the rebels to get the chemical arms first we had to say that damascus would use the chemical arms
[27:53.480 --> 27:58.520]  so the u.s and others had to invade physically not just use proxy al-qaeda not a saudi arabia
[27:58.520 --> 28:03.800]  and other areas same folks they use in libya same folks that were running security in bengazi that
[28:03.800 --> 28:09.480]  killed the ambassador our government runs al-qaeda i had jerome corsey new york times bestseller big
[28:10.040 --> 28:14.840]  mega conservative swift voted john carrey and he said our government runs the drugs and runs
[28:14.840 --> 28:19.560]  al-qaeda and he said basically you do you know that i need to be apologized to by everybody
[28:19.560 --> 28:26.760]  that i'm right it's not our government though it's criminal foreign globalist elements that need
[28:26.760 --> 28:30.360]  the terror threat to take our rights look at the homeland security documents
[28:30.360 --> 28:34.520]  where they say it's gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians returning veterans
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.480]  people like that are who they're targeting it was never about al-qaeda this is a foreign takeover
[28:39.480 --> 28:44.200]  of america by criminal interest who wrapped themselves in the flag and i'm risking my life
[28:44.200 --> 28:49.800]  to bring you this information this isn't a joke or a game now obama's engaged in a psyop now saying

[34:15.880 --> 34:21.080]  hear on the broadcast and i want to get into how government is exempting itself from the law
[34:21.080 --> 34:27.880]  and actually making themselves uh into the new royalty and how this is the way of governments
[34:27.880 --> 34:33.480]  and then we'll tie it in to the unprecedented attack on the second amendment and new deception
[34:33.480 --> 34:38.840]  from obama and we've got him caught uh red-handed on this but but first off for radio listeners
[34:39.480 --> 34:43.640]  uh it's in the international business times it's in the associated press it's in
[34:43.640 --> 34:48.440]  the weekly standard here's the international business times government officials they're
[34:48.440 --> 34:56.280]  not servants government officials authorities masters see royalty government officials can
[34:56.280 --> 35:01.160]  still own assault weapons under feinstein bill that's the main bill they're trying to get past
[35:01.160 --> 35:08.040]  that doesn't just ban 158 specifically firearms because it says and anything similar anything like
[35:08.040 --> 35:12.520]  it's it's thousands of different firearms it's it's it's most pumped shotguns if they've got
[35:12.520 --> 35:18.520]  what they call military features like a handle or a hole in the stock it's it's thousands of
[35:18.520 --> 35:23.880]  firearms let me just give you that uh little news tip there now dion feinstein we played the clubs
[35:23.880 --> 35:28.360]  you can just type in dion feinstein admit she has a concealed carry she admits she's worth 100
[35:28.360 --> 35:32.840]  million dollars that she magically made since she hit the senate in 93 didn't have that when she
[35:32.840 --> 35:38.280]  got there uh you know pelosi's worth 300 400 million dollars didn't have it when she went
[35:38.280 --> 35:43.800]  but so what you own a couple hundred thousand dollars a year was 176 000 as a senator you know
[35:43.800 --> 35:47.720]  she's had some good investments everything's gone well now she got caught inside her trading but
[35:47.720 --> 35:52.120]  they just passed a law legalizing it because they're the new royalty and you know they they
[35:52.120 --> 35:55.160]  caught more senators with underage kids but they you know they're saying you know what
[35:55.880 --> 35:59.960]  they're senators i mean that's okay all right you know and if you whistle blow on it you'll
[35:59.960 --> 36:06.040]  go to jail like the like the uh scia guy the fbi came and grabbed him because the government's the
[36:06.040 --> 36:13.240]  royalty and what they're noticing is the police don't want to confiscate the guns because they're
[36:13.240 --> 36:17.000]  going to have their guns confiscated in fact retired new york police are having an downturn
[36:17.000 --> 36:21.720]  in their guns under the new law and you know what i've got an article here where they're refusing
[36:21.720 --> 36:27.160]  in mass that's coming up but so are the citizens so now cuomo is talking about well we'll retro
[36:27.160 --> 36:33.240]  actively do a writer bill through so you can have your guns oh good because because you're royal see
[36:33.240 --> 36:37.640]  if you ever work for the government which is about a third of the population you're now exempt from
[36:37.640 --> 36:43.320]  all the laws you put on us just like congress is exempt from last time i checked over 400
[36:43.320 --> 36:49.480]  laws they've passed since 1975 you can look this up i mean you know they're exempt from obamacare
[36:49.480 --> 36:55.640]  they're exempt from insider trading because they say so they're exempt from reporting
[36:56.360 --> 37:00.440]  incomes that citizens don't have to i've seen numbers of upwards of half of congress
[37:00.440 --> 37:06.920]  doesn't pay taxes remember geithner hadn't paid in decades the treasury secretary because
[37:07.640 --> 37:13.560]  i've seen so many famous ultra-rich robber baron say taxes that's for common people you know you
[37:13.560 --> 37:19.320]  read about general electric and google paying zero tax or two point three percent tax because they
[37:19.320 --> 37:28.520]  write the laws suckers you understand how this works they're pirates with slick pr groups out
[37:28.520 --> 37:33.880]  there big money wants higher taxes because they get it in government contracts and bailouts now
[37:33.880 --> 37:40.600]  let's continue here with the new royalty and i shot a video again up at info wars.com that
[37:40.600 --> 37:44.760]  actually shows for radio listeners everything i'm going to be talking about here it's called
[37:44.760 --> 37:52.920]  federal government declares itself royal right up at the top of info wars.com in the featured news
[37:52.920 --> 37:58.120]  area very very important to go to the site and to get that video and send it out to your friends
[37:58.120 --> 38:06.680]  and family so they understand something see our country was founded in 1776 that's when it kicked
[38:06.680 --> 38:14.760]  off with force saying we're not going to bow to any man we only bow to god and it was the preachers
[38:14.760 --> 38:18.120]  that led the fight they were called the black brigade because preachers regardless of their
[38:18.120 --> 38:26.120]  catholic or protestant wore black no no king but king jesus because all the royalty the giant
[38:26.120 --> 38:32.120]  swelling royalty from sir which there were thousands of in the in the colonies up to lords
[38:32.120 --> 38:38.360]  patronage uh get free houses free everything from the government it's like a welfare system
[38:39.400 --> 38:42.920]  and and you couldn't and be involved in manufacturing you couldn't own or sell
[38:42.920 --> 38:47.080]  large pieces of land you couldn't be in business manufacturing anything
[38:47.080 --> 38:51.720]  unless you were royal or got a license from royalty
[38:54.360 --> 38:59.240]  and george washington uh was unable to get pieces of land that he had actually fought
[38:59.240 --> 39:04.760]  for in the militia because he wasn't royal and you know they wrote books and papers about how
[39:04.760 --> 39:09.000]  the royals are a bunch of lazy arrogant scum they could rape your wife if they wanted to they could
[39:09.000 --> 39:13.560]  beat you up they had fake courts they didn't follow the laws and the englishmen had fought
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.960]  in england for hundreds of years to get basic rights you know they they cut king's heads off
[39:18.760 --> 39:25.000]  and so there was freedom in england to a great extent in 1775 1776 but not here and people said
[39:25.000 --> 39:34.840]  hey we have the same rights magna carta parliament act stop it and it didn't stop and government
[39:34.840 --> 39:42.600]  would exempt itself from the law english military officers would uh beat somebody's son up and kill
[39:42.600 --> 39:47.400]  him in front of witnesses and not get in trouble they bayonet someone for no reason in front of
[39:47.400 --> 39:53.880]  witnesses so citizens started taking the law into their own hands and killing redcoats the civil war
[39:53.880 --> 39:57.400]  had already started for about a decade before so they started quartering troops and beating
[39:57.400 --> 40:01.640]  up more people and killing more people and confiscating guns and you know the rest of the

[40:47.480 --> 40:54.520]  scottish or irish people fighting for liberty that would be america okay but they in 1922
[40:54.520 --> 40:59.240]  they established the pratt house under british intelligence churchill wrote three books on this

[47:03.960 --> 47:11.880]  you're listening to the alex jones broadcasting network network from the front lines of the
[47:11.880 --> 47:35.880]  information war it's alex jones
[47:41.880 --> 47:50.200]  again this is such a wide subject and the last hundred years or so every american president has
[47:50.200 --> 47:57.640]  had royal background on both sides of their family obama on his mother's side is related
[47:57.640 --> 48:02.600]  to bush and cheney if you don't believe me just search engine and it's it's mainstream news but
[48:02.600 --> 48:07.080]  you have to understand royalty is just criminal groups that were able to take over because they
[48:07.080 --> 48:12.440]  were the most vicious and normally they're just whoever's in charge at first and then within two
[48:12.440 --> 48:20.360]  or three generations they declare themselves gods they declare themselves of the stars and that you
[48:20.360 --> 48:27.880]  are slaves and then only they have rights and if you study this that's why obama always kneels to
[48:27.880 --> 48:34.520]  the british royalty to the saudi royalty well there's dozens of photos i mean what is there
[48:34.520 --> 48:40.680]  like 15 or more groups he's bowed to you've seen that i have something i want to show some of the
[48:40.680 --> 48:46.440]  viewers out there on tv but anybody can just type in obama bowing to see him bowing to every royal
[48:46.440 --> 48:53.960]  house major and minor out there now if you expand on that let's put up the history of the red carpet
[48:54.600 --> 49:02.040]  the greeks and babylonians used it to symbolize uh royalty and that and that he who walked on
[49:02.040 --> 49:09.960]  a red carpet was a god not mortal and that the mortals blood was the path on which they walked
[49:09.960 --> 49:17.960]  it is a giant ocean a river of blood on which conquering god kings walk by the way i'm reading
[49:17.960 --> 49:25.160]  from major university uh websites agamemnon known that only gods walk on such luxury responds with
[49:25.160 --> 49:32.520]  trepidation i am immortal man i cannot trample upon those uh tinted splendors without fear thrown
[49:32.520 --> 49:41.880]  in my path and it just goes on from there so there is the times of times of old our presidents
[49:43.000 --> 49:48.040]  did not walk on red carpets until the time of edward bernays the father of the word modern
[49:48.040 --> 49:53.880]  propaganda who worked for the department of war and others he's the reason you eat bacon and eggs
[49:53.880 --> 49:57.640]  they couldn't sell the pork bellies they put out advertisements in the newspaper saying everybody's
[49:57.640 --> 50:01.960]  got to have bacon with their eggs he's the guy that said have feminists walk with cigarettes and
[50:01.960 --> 50:06.760]  tell women it's cool you can get the other half of women smoking he said we can break up the family
[50:06.760 --> 50:11.320]  by telling women it's cool to work all day and then we'll get double taxes whether you support
[50:11.320 --> 50:15.480]  women working or not the point is and bernays wrote three books go read them three that i've
[50:15.480 --> 50:19.880]  read i think he must have written more the point is he wrote propaganda and others and he sits
[50:19.880 --> 50:24.680]  there calling you dumb animals when you read the book and how there's a giant mind control system
[50:24.680 --> 50:29.880]  and how they would treat this is in the 20s politicians like royalty and have red carpets
[50:29.880 --> 50:36.920]  and have hollywood that had just started together with them at dinners to to to blur the the the
[50:36.920 --> 50:41.000]  people that have become the new royalty artists and people which is actually in the old times
[50:41.000 --> 50:46.280]  more healthy than royalty at least they did something you liked with the politicians and
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.480]  now our politicians fly around what is it 10 million dollars per trip with air force one
[50:52.200 --> 50:56.040]  and whoever the speaker of the house is gets an identical air force one it's called what air force
[50:56.040 --> 51:02.120]  two there's an air force three and then even minor officers generals get their own private jets and
[51:02.120 --> 51:08.440]  their own private little female assistant hookers to follow them around this is the decadence and
[51:08.440 --> 51:13.960]  and and again if you read article one section nine clause eight of the constitution several
[51:13.960 --> 51:19.640]  other clauses that we have posted up at infowars.com and prison planet.com in the federal
[51:19.640 --> 51:26.440]  government declares itself royal video and under it i have links to these areas it is a felony and
[51:26.440 --> 51:32.200]  an impeachable offense when the president or anyone in the federal government or with the
[51:32.200 --> 51:38.440]  federal commission takes a title of nobility but we've had sitting presidents become knighted
[51:38.440 --> 51:45.000]  by the way that a lot of stuff comes with that if they that's a huge payoff no title of nobility
[51:45.000 --> 51:50.680]  shall be granted by the united states and no person holding any office of profit or trust
[51:50.680 --> 51:57.400]  under them shall with the consent of the congress accept any present ammonium of office or title or
[51:57.400 --> 52:03.320]  of any kind whatsoever from any king prince or foreign state they all take giant speaking gifts
[52:03.320 --> 52:09.320]  million dollar speaking gifts by the saudis by the emperor of japan that's why they bow that's
[52:09.320 --> 52:13.880]  why they sell us out and and now they can order torture even though it's illegal and if the cia
[52:13.880 --> 52:19.240]  blows the whistle they go to jail that's in the news today 30 months they can order all sorts of
[52:19.240 --> 52:24.200]  other criminal nsa wiretapping without warrants and they claim the government's secret and above
[52:24.200 --> 52:31.000]  the law and now they're going to give all federal employees and police period and the house and the
[52:31.000 --> 52:36.440]  senate can have any firearm they want that government bans the bill just says we can have
[52:36.440 --> 52:43.160]  whatever we want we're above the law why not the un set up by the rockefellers 1945 presidio san
[52:43.160 --> 52:48.600]  francisco and they gave them the land to build it in new york that they have diplomatic immunity
[52:48.600 --> 52:52.680]  that's why you never hear about un war crimes even though it was even the new york times last year
[52:52.680 --> 52:59.160]  they're in multiple african countries and multiple south american countries just type into a search
[52:59.160 --> 53:05.320]  engine uh un uh back groups engaged in genocide under un and you'll get it you know four thousand
[53:05.320 --> 53:11.720]  people in burma kill them for their land whatever all over the world and it's in the new york times
[53:11.720 --> 53:16.120]  yeah the un group went in and uh you know killed everybody in this african village take their land
[53:16.120 --> 53:21.160]  but it's for the earth you know every miss america says i love the un it must be nice i heard it over
[53:21.160 --> 53:28.680]  and over again this is the mind control and and again my big epiphany was oh my gosh i mean i
[53:28.680 --> 53:33.000]  already knew this but you know this whether you love the vatican or hate the vatican whatever
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.400]  the vatican has its own city outside of italian law and can do whatever it wants
[53:37.960 --> 53:41.560]  and declares itself sovereign and has diplomatic immunity worldwide
[53:43.400 --> 53:50.280]  it has its own swiss military to back them up see the swiss are smart they learn from the vatican
[53:50.280 --> 53:54.440]  they have their own country and say we're outside of your national laws israel does the same thing
[53:54.440 --> 53:59.720]  it's basically a city-state the city of london within london listen this is key is a tiny area
[53:59.720 --> 54:04.520]  i've been there most expensive real estate in the world and it's above the law pays no taxes
[54:04.520 --> 54:07.880]  it's its own country and that's where the rothschild banks and rockefeller banks are
[54:09.240 --> 54:16.920]  the un in the u.s above the law nafta and gat these organizations the organization of american
[54:16.920 --> 54:21.800]  states and others they're above the law eu bureaucrats just type in eu bureaucrats pay no
[54:21.800 --> 54:26.440]  tax guys show them that i want people to see that watching on tv just type in eu bureaucrats pay no
[54:26.440 --> 54:32.520]  tax no wonder the head of the imf said 77 tax isn't enough for the average greek to pay you
[54:32.520 --> 54:40.040]  need to work six seven days a week and pay more tax she's exempt from tax see and now they've
[54:40.040 --> 54:45.800]  introduced bills where the where if you work for the government you're exempt from the laws you're
[54:45.800 --> 54:52.680]  enforcing it is the essence of royalty that's all royalty means notice how the police wear four
[54:52.680 --> 54:57.480]  stars on their lapels like their generals now on their emulates they they wear bigger and bigger
[54:57.480 --> 55:03.960]  hats more and more salad dressing on their shirts you know the generals that's royalty the generals
[55:03.960 --> 55:09.560]  walk around with little gold canes under their arms black boots the police they're the authorities
[55:09.560 --> 55:14.920]  they're the officials you're the servant in america they we were the first country other
[55:14.920 --> 55:20.040]  than a short period in a few city states of greece to say government isn't god the people are number
[55:20.040 --> 55:25.560]  one and there's a bill of rights and constitution to protect these enshrined rights that even at 51
[55:25.560 --> 55:31.000]  say let's enslave the other 49 two wolves in a sheet voting on what's for dinner no one can take
[55:31.000 --> 55:34.600]  that away obama is in the news i'm going to read it when we come back in the next hour and then go
[55:34.600 --> 55:39.800]  to your calls saying hey i've got the majority in polls wanting to take guns and the house
[55:39.800 --> 55:44.920]  republicans won't let me because they speak for their you know for their minority constituents no
[55:44.920 --> 55:48.280]  they speak for the bill of rights and constitution he says i'll just do an executive order
[55:51.480 --> 55:55.960]  too grand to pay taxes too arrogant to care about democracy no wonder the euro elite sneer
[55:55.960 --> 56:01.640]  at the idea of referendum daily mail and it goes on about how she pays no taxes they pay no taxes
[56:02.840 --> 56:07.880]  again ladies and gentlemen and the globalist always create luxembourgs and switzerland's
[56:07.880 --> 56:13.800]  and israel's and vatican's and cities of london within london where if you get entrance into the
[56:13.800 --> 56:17.720]  city of london they let you into the group you pay no taxes you're above the law you're god
[56:19.000 --> 56:25.560]  if you can become a un diplomat or one of their legates one of their minions you now are are
[56:25.560 --> 56:31.400]  literally above the law this is royalty in north korea three generations of dictators
[56:31.400 --> 56:37.880]  right around in these huge displays where people worship them at sports stadiums as god and that's
[56:37.880 --> 56:42.840]  supposedly communism for the little guy all communism is is a tiny elite ruling everyone
[56:42.840 --> 56:48.440]  as their slaves saying oh look you're free you all share equally in the work that's all any of
[56:48.440 --> 56:55.560]  this is fascism socialism communism it's always tiny groups ruling over you before the communist
[56:55.560 --> 57:02.280]  revolution of 150 years ago roughly there was no left and right left was feminine male was seen as
[57:02.280 --> 57:06.680]  right the devil left god right whatever you think of that that's what left and right was there was
[57:06.680 --> 57:11.640]  only is there more freedom or less the globalists seek to overthrow the renaissance to overthrow
[57:11.640 --> 57:16.280]  the enlightenment of the last 500 years that our republic's founding was the greatest expression
[57:16.280 --> 57:22.440]  of there is a systematic revolution by special interests backed by royals at the head of it
[57:22.440 --> 57:27.240]  the Rothschilds are now lords with the Saxe-Coburg-Goethe transylvanian german royalty that runs
[57:27.240 --> 57:32.200]  england the dutch royalty the saudi royalty the spanish royalty look at who owns our toll roads
[57:32.200 --> 57:39.240]  the spanish royalty literally juan carlos they are in a revolution against our forebearers gains
[57:39.240 --> 57:45.320]  in the revolutions of 1776 and others we are in the ultimate battle against royalty and criminality
[57:45.320 --> 57:50.760]  you prepare by purchasing gold food and firearms but if you don't have a home security system

[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:31.240]  the drugs publicly and then gets caught and doesn't get in trouble and now senators are
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:33.960]  getting caught with little kids they're not getting in trouble and that was in the news
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:41.240]  this week that's when you know you're in deep trouble because royalty will give to their friends
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:45.560]  and themselves everything even if stuff starts collapsing it's like you know the friends are
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:50.760]  about to storm the bastille and they say they're starving to death they're saying bread bread they
[01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:54.920]  must have bread they're starving to death and you know even our generals were like we've got to you
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.240]  got giant stables in stores full of food you've got to feed them or they're going to kill us and
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:04.360]  she says just let them eat cake just just just give them some cake just something most people
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:08.840]  never get cake in their whole life in france it was so so tyrannical and they just stormed the
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:12.760]  whole place and killed everybody and then and then its own evil came out of that the french
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:20.200]  revolution and uh ladies and gentlemen this is the type of stuff that's going on this is the
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:27.160]  type of stuff that's happening and so so i'm not just saying they're becoming royalty figuratively
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:33.480]  they are royalty the new world order is run by royalty and the roth child's married into it and
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:40.840]  it uses the royalty system government officials not servants see when the media does that you've
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:45.320]  got to call them email them and say stop calling them officials if you can just make them call
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:51.080]  themselves servants that's half the battle and and alex de tocqueville and others historians
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.520]  wrote about the united states after our revolutionary war had been successful that we
[01:01:56.520 --> 01:02:02.920]  were different because people didn't bow down to classes here it was about how hard working you
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:09.960]  were and what you stood for that's what all this was about and how we were so different in that
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.560]  and that's what made us so great royalty stagnates things why did half the wealth in the world
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:22.440]  belong to five percent of the world the u.s population until the 70s because ladies and
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:29.400]  gentlemen we had more liberty and you're like well we had all sorts of bad stuff we had slavery
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:34.600]  we had everything else the idea of human liberty not just being for royals where they're sovereign
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:41.000]  and have rights well now it was going to be not just white guys who were wealthy like had been
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.120]  in england now it was going to be all white guys and not just if you were catholic or if you were
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.040]  protestant because there was a battle over who would have rights and who was in control now it
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:56.040]  was catholic or protestant or quaker and then pretty soon other people said you know what
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.840]  black people shouldn't be slaves white people said that we should they should be free and that
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:06.600]  debate happened for 50 60 years and then you saw what happened and then women said oh we want to
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:11.160]  be more free but see that was then co-opted as a control mechanism anything's going to be co-opted
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:15.880]  just like the french revolution by the illuminati the jackabins people like illuminati that's a
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:21.480]  tom hanks movie no that's encyclopedia britannica you see knowledge will open the world up to you
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:28.600]  and you'll realize it's the very same elements our forebears 235 36 years ago are fighting the
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:34.280]  exact same bloodlines we're fighting the rothschilds then folks and the gothas then
[01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:42.520]  okay and and we're under the same system right now and i don't care whether it's the big monolithic
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:49.080]  catholic church or israel or the city of london in london the banking city or the un they all act
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:54.040]  just the same because it's the same trick they dress up they have a red carpet they wear a crown
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:59.000]  men in black suits stand around intimidate the villagers we are your god if a giant alien
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:04.840]  spacecraft landed and a red carpet rolled off and you know a guy walked off 18 foot tall green alien
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:10.200]  with a gold crown on and broadcast in english i am your king i guarantee you obama the queen of
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:16.040]  england and all the rest of them if gorp you know the the alien from ploop tart showed up and said
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:20.280]  i'm going to annihilate your planet if you don't bow to me and he had other blurps from the planet
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.880]  bloop tart standing there with earpieces and laser guns i guarantee you our leaders would go and kneel
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:33.320]  to them and bow and say we now you know rename this blerp too i'm not joking because if you
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:38.120]  wear a crown and have a red carpet it's over well let me tell you something i've been on the red

[01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:03.160]  british royalty is exempt from their own taxes and own laws and are the richest people in the world
[01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:08.440]  the rothchild's after them and it's the same thing with juan carlos of spain one of the biggest owner
[01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:14.040]  of eu properties he's given the major roads able to put toll roads on them he puts toll roads on

[01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:26.200]  torture that matter if it's illegal they go to jail for whistleblowing congress has exempted
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:31.320]  itself from hundreds and hundreds of laws in the last 30 years they didn't do it before because it
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.760]  was illegal they've bum rushed us just had a revolution of tyranny where they exempt themselves
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:42.680]  from capital gains taxes they exempt themselves from obamacare taxes and now dianne feinstein's

[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:16.760]  today up at infowars.com federal government declares itself royale think about it and the un
[01:08:19.640 --> 01:08:25.480]  so many other globalist organizations set up these city states that are exempt from taxes
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:31.640]  exempt from laws exempt from everything with diplomatic immunity and we just accept okay
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:37.000]  you're allowed to run drugs and get caught not get in trouble you in oh the military u.s military now
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.560]  admits they grow the opium and ship it out on c130s but let's not talk about that national
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:47.720]  security i've got fox news abc bbc all saying that and you know what's important about this
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:52.840]  broadcast and why i i'm so blessed what i talk about this year you'll hear in two or three years
[01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:58.760]  on the big neo-con radio shows i tune into those sometimes now and literally stuff i was pioneering
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:03.400]  a decade ago or five years ago or six months ago now it's quicker and quicker is on their shows
[01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:09.880]  i make it safe to talk about this but i'm going to ask you something how can congress last year
[01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:16.120]  get caught some some congress people making 30 40 50 million a year on insider trading
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.960]  nancy pelosi goes to congress with nothing last time i saw something like 400 million dollars
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:27.000]  million dollars the mayor of san francisco worth less than a million dollars go look at her
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:33.720]  financials they're public she's worth over 100 mil right now the latest numbers just came out
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:41.320]  some estimates are 150 mil how do you make 150 mil on 175 000 176 000 a year the answer is you don't
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:46.600]  in san francisco you live in a doghouse for that these people know what they're doing and they got
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:51.720]  caught and they think you're dumb because you act like you're dumb you don't do the research you
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:55.240]  don't put the time in you got all the fantasy football numbers figured out to show off to your
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:10:00.200]  buddies women have all the fashion stuff figured out but you don't know how the world works see if
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.720]  you're really cool if you're really successful the information i know in business i can go out
[01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:11.640]  and make a mint right now the information and i'm not gonna even start bragging the point is is that
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.480]  i want you to have that knowledge the globalists don't want you to have the knowledge i want to
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:20.760]  empower humanity i want to move the whole species forward not dumb everybody down so a group of
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:28.920]  insiders can control everything i'm fundamentally offended that our founding fathers fought against
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:33.640]  laws where british nobility could own guns and their servants and minions and their militia
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:37.560]  but the rest of the citizens had to turn their guns in 234 years ago
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.400]  i'm fundamentally offended that when they got caught insider trading that was big news cnn
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:49.960]  abc helped cover it up they went don't worry they're gonna pass a law outlawing it there
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:55.400]  are already a bunch of laws outlawing it i mean literally more than a hundred they've had
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:11:01.560]  congressional studies on it over the last 200 plus years hundreds of laws on this hundreds of laws on
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:08.120]  this they passed a new law saying it made it illegal it made it legal but you can't pass a law
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.360]  saying you can kill little kids because you feel like it you can't pass a law saying blacks are
[01:11:12.360 --> 01:11:17.800]  slaves again because moral authority says it's wrong it's moral authority that gets things done
[01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:23.640]  it's recognizing we're being told we're slaves they passed a law saying of the house for senate
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:30.520]  ethics committee look this up just happened last year 2012 says they can have an investment on
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:36.360]  something i mean there's examples of feinstein giving 25 million dollars to a brand new startup
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:45.800]  genetic engineering company in san francisco that has no company no nothing like cylindra
[01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:51.480]  energy no no business no nothing half a million bucks 25 million in a bill she writes and gets
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:58.120]  passed and then she's the biggest stock owner she's the biggest stock owner of a brand new
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:05.720]  mailbox that's the business a mailbox and a scientist and then she gives it 25 million of
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:11.480]  taxpayer money and then she gets three million of it the next month i mean you know and go look this
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:17.800]  up look her saying she's above the law and she's going to still be able to own any guns she wants
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:23.000]  and she is a big gun owner and bloomberg's a big gun owner but you can't own guns in new york what
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.400]  dirt bags it makes me sick you know going back about six seven years i got to know charlie sheen
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:33.080]  because he's a listener a lot of other hollywood folks but they you know they're they're they're
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:37.800]  private friends and charlie's had some wild times i know he's a smart guy he was on piers morgan
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:41.800]  friday i happen to see it today he's like well i don't have guns anymore because of a domestic
[01:12:41.800 --> 01:12:46.280]  problem but i that's okay because i've got great security team hey charlie we don't all make three
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.640]  million dollars a week bro and i know you know better than that i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna
[01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:59.400]  call him you know this this just blows me away your piers morgan has a private security detail
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:04.360]  nancy pelosi has a private security detail and our taxpayer money to pay for it she got an insider
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:09.560]  trading on record but she but she said she's royal you know the un gets caught drug dealing
[01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:15.880]  or running white slavery well you know they're the un they're immune i mean the un sex slavery

[01:21:21.480 --> 01:21:26.680]  bill and that's that royalty here's weekly standard feinstein gun control bill to exempt
[01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:32.200]  government officials when government passes law saying they're exempt or they can arbitrarily
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:36.840]  do whatever they want that's royalty and our ancestors all over the world fought against
[01:21:36.840 --> 01:21:42.360]  royalty so they couldn't just say take him to the dungeon take her away where i want your wife and
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:48.120]  many a king was killed over this many a queen so in ancient times the last 600 years or so most
[01:21:48.120 --> 01:21:53.960]  royalty couldn't order you killed because they felt like it courts were created some kangaroo
[01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:59.880]  some not now they're back to ndaa disappear torture him unbelievable so again i'm done
[01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:06.680]  talking about the royalty uh cuomo says new gun law does not exempt new york cops could prevent
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:11.000]  police from responding to school shootings and will make the cops turn this is active
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.800]  cops turn in semi-auto and of course the retired are now having to turn theirs in and i've got
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:20.680]  articles here where tens of thousands including police current police in new york are saying we're
[01:22:20.680 --> 01:22:25.080]  not doing this new york state there over a hundred sheriffs have come out we're going to play a clip
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.760]  of that in a few minutes saying they're not turning their guns in and they're not going to
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.400]  take the citizens guns but we've had some of these sheriffs on all over the country black white old
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:40.200]  young northerner southerner westerner people are waking up and that's the good news because the
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:46.440]  fbi crime statistics are violent crimes drop 59 49 excuse me we have the statistics up at info
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:53.880]  wars.com old video presentation off fbi.gov 49 drop in in violent crime in the last 20 years
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:23:00.920]  and that drop is accelerating 21 of that is just since 2007 we've done whole tutorials
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:08.280]  up at prisonplanet.tv and info wars.com off fbi.gov showing you their stats okay so the
[01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:13.080]  system's panicking the police know that where they don't have gun ownership the criminals
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:19.160]  are busting in raping people and killing them and the criminals have guns so we've got that news now
[01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:26.120]  let's look at this incredible deception by obama obama up at camp david we do skeet shooting all
[01:23:26.120 --> 01:23:34.040]  the time so he's coming out again saying hey we gotta be nice uh to gun owners he's saying that
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:40.120]  uh you know what we just want to restrict some of your guns it's about hunting but it's no big deal
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:47.000]  so again the second amendment is not about hunting so he says i agree you have the second
[01:23:47.000 --> 01:23:51.320]  amendment just everything semi-auto is going to be taken now in australia they took all the
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:56.600]  semi-autos over a decade ago now they're banning bolt action and single shot they've done this in
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:24:00.680]  over 100 countries in the last century let me go to the other article that's the weekly standard
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:06.840]  fox news obama suggests republicans unwilling to compromise and gun control debate
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:13.720]  this is a quote from obama the house republican majority is made up of mostly of members
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.400]  who are in sharply gerrymandered districts you mean areas you don't control the electronic
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:22.920]  wedding machines that are very safely republican and may not feel compelled to pay attention to
[01:24:22.920 --> 01:24:27.560]  broad-based public opinion you don't pay attention to opinion you've manufactured with fake polls
[01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:33.800]  the bill of rights says i keep my private property and that i can have whatever religion i want even
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:39.000]  if you get 99 to say they disagree you understand punk we're a republic not a democracy a pure
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:44.200]  democracy is hell because what they really concerned about is opinions of their specific
[01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:49.800]  republican constituents no obama you globalist traitor they're concerned with the constitution
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:54.840]  and bill of rights he said it's understandable that people are protective of their family
[01:24:54.840 --> 01:24:59.080]  traditions when it comes to hunting so gun control advocates also need to do
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:05.160]  a little more listening than they do sometimes more patronizing folks i've shown these quotes
[01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:10.840]  as state senator he said ban all guns the un treaty says ban all guns that civilian ownership
[01:25:10.840 --> 01:25:16.600]  should be completely abolished the civilian ownership of firearms should be ended because
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:20.840]  it threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state they say there should be an abolition
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:29.960]  of civilian ownership of firearms that's a quote go read it that is in the interpretation addendum
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:40.040]  july 7 2001 unit deer rockefeller facility new york city look it up it's in there okay so so so
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:44.920]  this is the garbage this is how they're playing possum with us let's go to a clip of obama four
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:51.000]  years ago four years and change you're in the 08 campaign saying i won't take any of your guns by
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.440]  the way in these thousands of guns that are banned thousands of different types because
[01:25:56.440 --> 01:26:01.480]  it's this type or anything like it it says pump shotguns ladies and gentlemen it says a shotgun
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:10.520]  with a handle on it a stock that has any groove on it i mean and remember oh we never want your
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:15.000]  guns we would never come for them no no no no no that's a conspiracy theory now they're all out
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.600]  coming for them ammo bands you name it they've they're taking they're saying cops can't have
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:25.400]  guns in new york semi-auto oh but they're now saying we'll pass a federal law to nullify that
[01:26:25.400 --> 01:26:29.960]  as if that can nullify state law if you cops just trust us you'll get your guns back they'll just
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:33.640]  pass another law later they don't want retired cops having guns they say the military the number
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:37.560]  one enemy retired military because they know you know how to fight in the myak and homeland
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:41.320]  security documents that are public that we were given by law enforcement big national news three
[01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:44.200]  and a half years ago you think they're going to let you have guns you know this is a criminal
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:49.480]  takeover the russians in 1917 told the retired military to turn their guns in and when they did
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.080]  they killed them all 30,000 in one day in moscow alone if you're dumb enough to help the new world
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.600]  order you get what you deserve collaborators let's go to this obama clip here it is when y'all go
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:04.440]  home and you're talking to your buddies and they say oh he wants to take my gun away
[01:27:04.440 --> 01:27:10.520]  they say he wants to take my gun away you've heard it here i'm on television so everybody knows it
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:18.120]  i believe in the second amendment i believe in people's lawful right to bear arms

[01:41:28.040 --> 01:41:33.480]  caller and i wanted to make a point about a gun show i went to this weekend just south of pampa
[01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:39.240]  the small town it's not very big and uh the line was completely out the door around the building
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:45.480]  and the police presence was out of control i mean you you wouldn't believe the police state of our
[01:41:45.480 --> 01:41:50.040]  gun shows now like you can't oh yeah they're acting like it's a it's a senator's meeting with
[01:41:50.040 --> 01:41:54.600]  little kids in there or something that they should be at when they're running around like flies we're
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:59.480]  getting info from gun dealers that the atf is leaning on them saying look you're not going to
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:04.920]  sell semi-autos or we're going to shut you down and they've done this before they're just lawless
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:10.200]  did you see rama manual say have the banks kick out all the gun shows and gun shops banks need
[01:42:10.200 --> 01:42:16.360]  to refuse gun owners i mean they're publishing our names they're attacking us like we're jews
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:22.840]  in nazi germany absolutely and that that comes as no surprise to me from a chicago mobster but
[01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:27.560]  what another point i wanted to make was that once i got inside the gun show it was so blatantly
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:33.320]  obvious the florida department of law enforcement and the atf undercover agents in there watching
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:38.120]  people surveilling everyone i mean i i got followed around just for buying high capacity
[01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:44.120]  magazines so i mean it's it's no no they're there now the whole homeland security anti-terror grid
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:49.160]  was always set up for gun owners in the takeover globalists run al-qaeda and they're now announcing

[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:55.480]  to you and the great work that you and your teamwork doing was driven by my desire to
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:01.000]  understand the physics of 9 11 that led me to architects and engineers for 9 11 truth
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:06.440]  where nearly 2 000 my colleague colleagues representing over 25 000 years of professional
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:11.000]  engineering and architectural experience have shown beyond a reasonable doubt that all three
[01:48:11.000 --> 01:48:15.080]  towers are brought down by controlled it's worse than that i've got the police and locals saying
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:18.280]  get back the government's gonna blow up building seven and i interviewed the deputy head of
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:21.960]  emergency management he said they blew it up and they killed him two weeks after i interviewed him
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:26.280]  they killed him barry jennings i mean i've got him on did i heard him on the news that day so
[01:48:26.280 --> 01:48:32.280]  they blew up building seven absolutely folks alex and all of the highly credentialed experts he has
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:37.960]  brought to you are right now is the time to act the founders were children of the enlightenment
[01:48:37.960 --> 01:48:43.000]  the constitution and the bill of rights they created are the most significant political
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.200]  documents ever produced in human history and they said we're not bowing down to royalty anymore i'd
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:53.560]  rather die than lick the boots of some punk on a red carpet who sucks my tax money out of me and
[01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:58.280]  tells me he's better than i am and those men defeated an empire nobody had ever beaten and
[01:48:58.280 --> 01:49:03.080]  that's why our stinking criminal government badmouth the founders and hollywood does is
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:07.720]  because they're unamerican foreign usurpers god bless you gotta jump jersey mike great point

[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:28.440]  think the timeline is before we really uh people start scooping up people such as yourself and
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:33.320]  stewart roads and others who's standing up for what's right they're going to start going after
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:38.440]  selective gun owners they'll pick quirky groups like waco burn them down kill them when you resist
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:42.600]  you'll be called terrorist and they plan on large numbers of police and military getting killed
[01:49:42.600 --> 01:49:46.200]  that's why cops and military say they're not going to be part of it plus a lot of them are patriots
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:50.760]  and then they'll they'll nuke a city or something and say the patriots did it with al-qaeda
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:54.760]  we've got three different west point papers now claiming conservatives are going to work with
[01:49:54.760 --> 01:50:00.680]  al-qaeda which is you know is ridiculous but they don't care you know again the globalists run
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:06.360]  al-qaeda but they're going to say we're al-qaeda so that's the kind of they're going to do school

[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:47.000]  have absolute proof of an imminent false flag attack in syria well i mean israel says they've
[01:50:47.000 --> 01:50:53.240]  got to invade because i'm not talking i'm talking about documents i have absolute proof i can send

[01:50:57.560 --> 01:51:03.240]  people this is imminent this is happening right now i have absolute proof i can't meet with every
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:09.640]  person that says it's imminent i mean everything everything i can send it to you right now so
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:17.880]  you're in the army uh no sir um i am calling on behalf of 4chan.org the uh the politically
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:25.320]  incorrect board um recently a hacker hacked the website of brit am defense and uncovered plans
[01:51:25.320 --> 01:51:32.200]  operations orders emails um the qatari government is hiring these uh british mercenaries to use
[01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:38.440]  ukrainian nationals to sneak russian chemical weapons into homes and detonate them and create
[01:51:38.440 --> 01:51:42.840]  a video they're going to blame it on the russians they're trying to start world war three i probably
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:47.880]  signed my own death warrant calling you with this alex it's real it's happening no no no the israelis
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:52.280]  say they're in reuters they're about to go in because al-qaeda is going to get chemical weapons
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:57.560]  when the west openly put al-qaeda in that's how dumb the royals think the american people are
[01:51:57.560 --> 01:52:03.960]  and it is katar that's involved behind all of this uh unbelievable uh i mean that's actually
[01:52:03.960 --> 01:52:09.720]  in the news and they've been saying go ahead i mean i have everything alex i can send it to you
[01:52:09.720 --> 01:52:14.600]  right now i can meet with your people yeah i don't have time to listen i don't here's the deal we
[01:52:14.600 --> 01:52:19.240]  get people every five minutes wanting to meet with us i mean but but but the issue is you should
[01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:25.160]  shoot a youtube video showing the documents and put it out in public so people can scrutinize them
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:29.480]  because you know all documents that are put on the internet aren't accurate but they're clearly
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:36.360]  been publicly getting everybody ready for a false flag where they claim syria uses chemical weapons
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:40.200]  now they know that won't fly so they're going to say al-qaeda is going to use them so they have to
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:46.520]  invade we have to invade because our own al-qaeda has them i mean this is how dumb they think the
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:53.960]  public is so jack listen uh why don't you scan those in put them up to youtube uh and uh again
[01:52:53.960 --> 01:52:59.320]  4chan is just it's just you understand anonymous can be good it can be bad but a lot of times it's

[01:55:03.320 --> 01:55:09.000]  your show and uh i totally agree with what you brought up recently uh about the royalist uh
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.760]  that you're talking about fight the same people exactly i think it's just another step because
[01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:20.360]  right now they're worried um there's so many people standing up uh in yeah they see everybody
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:25.800]  buying guns congress has a nine percent approval rating they're panicking their offense attack is a
[01:55:25.800 --> 01:55:31.400]  defense move we need to go on the double offense on these people exactly and you know you were
[01:55:31.400 --> 01:55:35.480]  talking about how they were going to make it to where the people in the military police were going
[01:55:35.480 --> 01:55:39.720]  to be exempt from this feinstein bill that's just the carrot in front of the car to get the
[01:55:39.720 --> 01:55:45.560]  mule to move where it wants to because the police and military in mass are joining us because we
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:50.360]  warned them before it happened exactly and they're trying to draw as many people away from the truth
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:55.960]  as they can well just pray for me folks because i can tell you i got good sense and i know how
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:56:01.080]  dangerous this is but we're going to defeat these people together they will do horrible atrocities
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:05.560]  sandy hook is so they can say gun owners you're not turning your guns in you're going to cause
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:10.200]  the next attack and they can have their own mercenaries do a mass shooting with a hundred
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:16.600]  dead kids blame a patsy then they're going to say see we told you you can see it all scripted
[01:56:16.600 --> 01:56:21.400]  fully wake up because folks you can't just turn your semi-autos in and have them leave you alone
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:27.880]  this purge is about demonizing all constitutionalist conservatives and libertarians you're the enemy
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:32.840]  of the takeover even if you've been co-opted by republicans you're still the enemy the only way
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:37.640]  out of this is by standing against them look at what he's done in the past people you obama
[01:56:37.640 --> 01:56:42.680]  supporters need to wake up well i mean most of them are actually halfway awake but they're on
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.960]  government payment they don't know how to live without the money god bless you kurt

[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:12.360]  you the awakening is even bigger than i thought it'd be people are waking up out here i just
[01:57:12.360 --> 01:57:16.920]  because we've been we've we've been attacking for 20 years before they launched their operation
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:22.680]  we're not in the dark no we're not and i like what sheriff piman says i'd rather have a bunch of i
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:27.080]  want the feds to stay out of my county there are no provision because they're not taking the guns
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:32.440]  away from the citizenry or my deputies he's an outstanding man in that county it's all happening
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:39.080]  right now it was all foretold and the founding fathers from 235 years ago are fighting with us
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:44.200]  right now their quotes their words the republic they fought for we have been given it as an
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:58:09.320]  heirloom we stand with george washington think of it think of it
