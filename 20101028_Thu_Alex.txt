[00:00.000 --> 00:12.880]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.880 --> 00:30.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:30.160 --> 00:36.400]  welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome it is Thursday the 28th day of October 2010
[00:36.400 --> 00:42.600]  we're gonna be live here for the next four hours today going into overdrive we
[00:42.600 --> 00:50.280]  have a lawyer Dustin Zaks who was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as being one
[00:50.280 --> 00:57.200]  of the major law firms that first won victories against the big mortgage
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.320]  firms and began to expose in the last three years the systemic endemic fraud
[01:03.320 --> 01:09.160]  at the heart of the mortgage system the fact that they're scamming you with all
[01:09.160 --> 01:14.200]  the fees they add the fact that they don't have the deed chain of custody
[01:14.200 --> 01:20.720]  we're gonna have him on coming up in an hour and a half today Dustin Zaks look
[01:20.720 --> 01:24.800]  I know we've got big election news and we've got economic news we're gonna
[01:24.800 --> 01:29.080]  cover all that too it's just this mortgage issue is coming down like a ton
[01:29.080 --> 01:34.280]  of bricks and it illustrates the fraud of Wall Street in this corrupt system so
[01:34.280 --> 01:38.960]  Dustin Zaks is gonna be joining us there's a key article in the Wall Street
[01:38.960 --> 01:43.560]  Journal I saw a week ago back on October 21st and in the next few weeks we're
[01:43.560 --> 01:48.120]  gonna get multiple lawyers on that are quoted in here they've got three
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.480]  different law firms and then several separate individual lawyers who have
[01:52.480 --> 01:57.280]  been successfully keeping people in their houses in some cases for six years
[01:57.280 --> 02:04.680]  after foreclosure begins six years and we've been doing other research on the
[02:04.680 --> 02:08.720]  lawyers and pro se litigants and people that are having success against the
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.760]  banksters that doesn't mean there's some silver all powerful bullet that will
[02:13.760 --> 02:18.680]  give you 100% victory but we know if you go to the average real estate law firm
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.080]  they will just take your money and do absolutely nothing and so I thought I
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.840]  would go over some of the tactics that are actually working and expose the
[02:29.840 --> 02:34.440]  fraud and and that means even if you are paying for your house you're not
[02:34.440 --> 02:39.960]  upside down but you were cheated on the fees and things and the closing cost
[02:39.960 --> 02:44.880]  you've got an issue or if they've sold your loan over and over again they they
[02:44.880 --> 02:47.640]  may try to come in and repossess it later even though you own your house
[02:47.640 --> 02:52.840]  that's the issue this isn't just people by the hundred plus thousand on average
[02:52.840 --> 02:56.920]  for the last year and a half straight hundred thousand a month out of their
[02:56.920 --> 03:03.320]  houses with foreclosures it isn't just those people it it's everybody because
[03:03.320 --> 03:09.000]  they destroyed the property deed system the common law system by design the
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.840]  evidence shows but it could backfire on these people but it's a niche lawyers
[03:14.840 --> 03:24.040]  spawned housing fracas is the detailed article out of the Wall Street Journal
[03:24.040 --> 03:33.000]  that quotes these different lawyers that have been successful in some cases for
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.080]  six years keeping people in their houses six years without a payment I think
[03:39.080 --> 03:43.320]  that's big and you know the issue is why are they able to do that because there's
[03:43.320 --> 03:47.920]  so much fraud involved and then of course we're going to part two or now part
[03:47.920 --> 03:51.880]  three of our interview in studio with Randy Kelton a pro se individual I want
[03:51.880 --> 03:54.760]  to do my research on this who's following some of the same tactics and
[03:54.760 --> 03:59.320]  going off the research of the successful pro se litigants and lawyers but also
[03:59.320 --> 04:06.680]  adding a twist to it for going for fraud lawsuits getting on the offensive against
[04:06.680 --> 04:12.040]  the banks not just fighting them in court using these systems to keep your
[04:12.040 --> 04:15.520]  house but getting on the offensive and some other lawyers are doing that as
[04:15.520 --> 04:22.240]  well so we're going to spend several hours on this subject today that said I
[04:22.240 --> 04:26.200]  want to blitz through some of the most important news when we get back and then

[08:35.320 --> 08:39.080]  people are chomping at the bit to talk about all the electronic voting machine

[08:44.800 --> 08:50.640]  news it's unfolding on the economy front a bunch of health news police state
[08:50.640 --> 08:58.120]  news war news it's all coming up but I just want to commend and salute the
[08:58.120 --> 09:03.440]  listeners of this radio slash TV transmission because you made our two
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.280]  search terms yesterday number one and number two respectively in both of the
[09:08.280 --> 09:11.960]  terms traded places back and forth for the number one and number two slot
[09:11.960 --> 09:17.280]  throughout the evening yesterday one of them was Conway cover-up reject Conway
[09:17.280 --> 09:21.680]  the Democratic candidate for Senate in Kentucky the hottest race in the nation
[09:21.680 --> 09:27.240]  besides Angle and Reed in Nevada that became the number one search term and
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.160]  generated a lot of coverage and several newspapers did pick it up and hundreds
[09:31.160 --> 09:34.440]  and hundreds of blogs so we've got a chance if you keep getting that
[09:34.440 --> 09:40.040]  information out about the obstruction of justice that's admitted by his brother
[09:40.040 --> 09:44.800]  and others that Conway warned with the narcotics investigation there in
[09:44.800 --> 09:48.680]  Kentucky of his brother a fellow prosecutor he of course is the attorney
[09:48.680 --> 09:52.000]  general that became the number one search term and was the number one search
[09:52.000 --> 09:57.440]  term off and on throughout the evening also 911 cover-up dealing with all of
[09:57.440 --> 10:01.880]  these NIST videos they suppressed now that have been released that detail
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.520]  bombs going off in Tower one two and seven including the New York FBI
[10:06.520 --> 10:10.800]  director talking about it on video we know why they tried to suppress this
[10:10.800 --> 10:16.120]  information show great job to everybody out there that got the word out on that
[10:16.120 --> 10:21.440]  it's our job now to contact the media the TV stations the radio stations to
[10:21.440 --> 10:24.880]  send them this information because it's come out in a few Kentucky newspapers a
[10:24.880 --> 10:29.640]  week ago but gotten almost no attention until you spread the word about it
[10:29.640 --> 10:34.640]  yesterday but here's the headline for the article we need to get out to
[10:34.640 --> 10:40.560]  everybody Conway cover-up media ignores admitted obstruction of justice
[10:40.560 --> 10:47.360]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com is where you will find that article and
[10:47.360 --> 10:52.560]  it's now been picked up by some other newspapers like Salem news and others
[10:52.560 --> 10:59.480]  drug issues plague attorney general Jack Conway on Kentucky's bid for US Senate
[10:59.480 --> 11:04.960]  that's just some of the headlines that are out there right now and I'll recap
[11:04.960 --> 11:11.040]  that story coming up but you notice that talk about Aqua Buddha from 30 years
[11:11.040 --> 11:16.040]  ago in college with Rand Paul here in Texas talk of him not being a doctor
[11:16.040 --> 11:19.920]  which is admitted to be a lie that is still at fever pitch I've been
[11:19.920 --> 11:23.080]  monitoring television and radio and I know you have been as well many of you
[11:23.080 --> 11:27.040]  that's all you hear about you you wouldn't think the depressions a problem
[11:27.040 --> 11:31.000]  the open borders are a problem the takeover by the federal government of
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  the internet through cyber security is a problem you wouldn't think the
[11:34.000 --> 11:38.840]  systemic total mortgage fraud is a problem the Federal Reserve announcing
[11:38.840 --> 11:45.280]  devaluation of the dollar that's not a problem the problem is that a woman
[11:45.280 --> 11:51.400]  reportedly ran up towards Rand Paul and we didn't have the video of this because
[11:51.400 --> 11:55.280]  the move on people had edited it but the witnesses said she charged up to him in
[11:55.280 --> 12:02.040]  his vehicle trying to throw something in his face and now for about a day and a
[12:02.040 --> 12:06.520]  half the video has been on the web big articles yesterday and today at info
[12:06.520 --> 12:12.080]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com dealing with this and its new video shows move on
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.480]  activists attempting to assault Rand Paul and to touch someone as an assault
[12:16.480 --> 12:21.080]  but his car is rolling at about three four miles an hour she runs up in her
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.600]  wig and it begins trying with the open window to shove the sign in and her
[12:26.600 --> 12:32.320]  arms are hanging in the car and Rand Paul is flailing and I mean what do you
[12:32.320 --> 12:37.480]  think would happen if you ran up to Jack Conway's car I would suspect
[12:37.480 --> 12:41.760]  suspected police were around they'd grab you throw to the ground and jump on top
[12:41.760 --> 12:44.600]  of you because they don't know if you've got a gun or what you're planning
[12:44.600 --> 12:50.280]  this is a highly charged national situation I mean was she gonna could
[12:50.280 --> 12:53.880]  someone have run up like with what happened with you know other famous
[12:53.880 --> 12:58.000]  political campaigns and things could get really nasty after that point and I'm
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.760]  not defending the guy that puts his foot on her shoulder to hold her down and
[13:01.760 --> 13:05.440]  then she tries to move and he puts a little more pressure he did not stomper
[13:05.440 --> 13:09.920]  and I'm still you know saying that I think it was wrong what he did and was
[13:09.920 --> 13:14.120]  excessive but we're conditioned in this public of the image of police taking
[13:14.120 --> 13:19.160]  somebody to the ground where they jump on their head with their knees or you know
[13:19.160 --> 13:22.200]  put their foot on your head or put their foot on your hand if you're
[13:22.200 --> 13:28.080]  resisting and sure in some cases it's excessive but the issue here is the
[13:28.080 --> 13:35.240]  media move on and and and George Soros outfits like Huffington Post they came
[13:35.240 --> 13:42.160]  out and they tried to imply that she'd done nothing and it was a lie by Rand
[13:42.160 --> 13:45.520]  Paul supporters that she ran up and tried to shove something in the car in his
[13:45.520 --> 13:50.840]  face and they said it's ridiculous she walked up nicely to show him the sign
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.520]  well that's not what happened and if you're a radio listener just get to a
[13:55.520 --> 14:00.800]  computer and go up to prisonplanet.com new video shows move on active as
[14:00.800 --> 14:08.720]  attempting to assault Rand Paul and here's the issue the media takes non-issues
[14:08.720 --> 14:13.480]  and hypes them up but then when you've got Jack Conway and his brother Matt
[14:13.480 --> 14:18.960]  Conway who's a prosecutor his brother's the attorney general and there's a
[14:18.960 --> 14:23.160]  narcotics investigation of trafficking and use they're planning to raid his
[14:23.160 --> 14:29.240]  house and the detectives go and tell him that they're coming and tell him get
[14:29.240 --> 14:32.360]  your you know get yourself clean and get yourself ready those are quotes out of
[14:32.360 --> 14:39.160]  the mainline courier journal a detailed report from the police reports they then
[14:39.160 --> 14:42.640]  warn his brother his brother has meetings with these people the attorney general
[14:42.640 --> 14:46.320]  and they go ahead and have the raid on the house two days later nothing's found
[14:46.320 --> 14:50.640]  then the detectives are questioned by other detectives and they admittedly in
[14:50.640 --> 14:55.360]  the newspaper they admit this is admitted that they lied and they say
[14:55.360 --> 14:59.440]  we're sorry we lied we just think Matt Conway's a good guy and this wasn't true
[14:59.440 --> 15:04.920]  so we warned him gee we hope we don't lose our jobs one guy says I know I won't
[15:04.920 --> 15:09.080]  be in narcotics for sure now and of course Conway's brother had to resign
[15:09.080 --> 15:13.520]  from the county where he was the prosecutor over this and this was
[15:13.520 --> 15:16.720]  actually last year this cover-up is just coming out now in the last month
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.680]  because there's still a criminal investigation that's open on the
[15:21.680 --> 15:27.240]  detectives lying and will it just be disciplinary or will they get in
[15:27.240 --> 15:31.320]  trouble will they actually get fired or will they be indicted and according to
[15:31.320 --> 15:35.000]  my understanding of the law and many other lawyers and police that I've talked
[15:35.000 --> 15:39.440]  to on air and off air since yesterday that that is the only move they can have
[15:39.440 --> 15:44.480]  is a criminal indictment of these people because they've admitted they've done
[15:44.480 --> 15:49.680]  it so you have bonafide real hardcore corruption we don't know about the
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.360]  narcotics because he got tipped off but we know that they were basically aiding
[15:53.360 --> 15:58.560]  and abetting him to evade an ongoing investigation we know that they then
[15:58.560 --> 16:03.960]  lied to investigators we now know that they were basically colluding to do
[16:03.960 --> 16:06.800]  this and we know that his brother the Attorney General Jack Conway was
[16:06.800 --> 16:13.560]  involved now this came out in the Courier Journal and other major
[16:13.560 --> 16:18.680]  publications a week ago just a couple newspapers and it's never gotten any
[16:18.680 --> 16:22.680]  attention since and that's why the mainstream media is so discredited and
[16:22.680 --> 16:29.480]  is losing their credibility and is falling apart because people know that
[16:29.480 --> 16:34.440]  a guy putting his foot on a lady is nothing compared to the Attorney General
[16:34.440 --> 16:40.440]  and his prosecutor brother and a bunch of detectives frustrating an narcotics
[16:40.440 --> 16:44.480]  investigation that is obstruction of justice bare minimum it's aiding and
[16:44.480 --> 16:50.480]  abetting bare minimum and they admit this now and they admit they lied during
[16:50.480 --> 16:55.760]  the onset of the investigation to other police investigators with the county and
[16:55.760 --> 17:05.280]  the state so this is very very serious and it's even more serious that you
[17:05.280 --> 17:09.440]  can't get this to become a national news story we're trying right now it's a
[17:09.440 --> 17:13.760]  very close race with Rand Paul and after all the false accusations they've
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.080]  slung at Rand after all the lies that were Conway implied that he's soft on
[17:18.080 --> 17:23.360]  drugs and somehow involved with drugs and in you know talked about supposed
[17:23.360 --> 17:27.600]  marijuana smoking 30 years ago now to know he's covering up an narcotics
[17:27.600 --> 17:31.760]  investigation of his brother and blocking investigations and warning him
[17:31.760 --> 17:36.040]  when he's the Attorney General I mean this is very serious and this hypocrite
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.080]  needs to be defeated next week bare minimum and we need to get these
[17:40.080 --> 17:43.600]  articles we've written that are linked to all the mainstream news articles about
[17:43.600 --> 17:46.760]  it so people aren't going to be in denial about this and get it out to
[17:46.760 --> 17:50.680]  everyone but right now I'm going to play the audio for radio listeners but the
[17:50.680 --> 17:56.080]  video is up on prisonplanet.com here is this move on org paid political
[17:56.080 --> 18:01.560]  mercenary charges through a crowd of supporters bust through the security
[18:01.560 --> 18:06.400]  just as the Rand Paul supporters had said three days ago on the eve of the
[18:06.400 --> 18:10.920]  last debate bust through them that's why I told Rand he shouldn't go to the
[18:10.920 --> 18:14.680]  debate there's going to be some type of setup and sure enough there was I would
[18:14.680 --> 18:19.560]  have not gone to that last debate and I've been on record saying that but other
[18:19.560 --> 18:22.960]  minds prevailed in the campaign they didn't listen to me and many others so
[18:22.960 --> 18:26.760]  fine in fact I think he ought to quit even campaigning for now and ought to hide
[18:26.760 --> 18:29.840]  out I mean there's no telling what they're going to do to him in the next
[18:29.840 --> 18:34.400]  four days but whatever everybody knows more than me so they do what they want
[18:34.400 --> 18:38.680]  the the point is his supporters and security told the truth about her
[18:38.680 --> 18:43.040]  busting through imagine a woman bust through bust through security runs up
[18:43.040 --> 18:49.960]  starts cramming a sign in the window of a moving car let's go ahead and play that
[18:49.960 --> 19:13.960]  clip here it is
[19:19.960 --> 19:31.720]  so imagine a woman in a wig bust through security runs up to a moving car
[19:31.720 --> 19:35.880]  going three miles an hour tries to cram it through the window not once not twice
[19:35.880 --> 19:43.120]  three times it's in there in Rand Paul's face I mean obviously they thought
[19:43.120 --> 19:46.480]  she could have been somebody with a gun or something so I don't think it's
[19:46.480 --> 19:49.840]  excessive force now that you look at it they didn't know what she had she was
[19:49.840 --> 19:53.840]  acting like somebody trying to bum rush him some kind of lunatic which was
[19:53.840 --> 19:57.480]  exactly what she wanted when they were taking her down she was smiling she
[19:57.480 --> 20:02.560]  thought mission accomplished they're gonna beat up a girl nine years thousands

[24:23.280 --> 24:27.000]  lot of phone calls today so we're gonna go ahead and launch into your calls
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.800]  right now Carolyn in Tennessee you're on the air
[24:30.800 --> 24:35.680]  hi Alex welcome to talk to you I wanted to talk to you about something that's
[24:35.680 --> 24:39.760]  really upsetting me I went to work the other day I work at a small northeast
[24:39.760 --> 24:44.680]  Tennessee hospital I'm a nurse and they were telling us that that we have to take
[24:44.680 --> 24:49.880]  it's mandatory to take the flu shot and I said no there is no law saying that we
[24:49.880 --> 24:54.840]  have to take the flu shot and they said they've written it into their employee
[24:54.840 --> 25:00.720]  handbook that you have to take the shot and as an afterthought they say well you
[25:00.720 --> 25:08.120]  can have a allergic or a religious out on it but if you don't take the flu shot
[25:08.120 --> 25:13.080]  you have to wear a mask yeah that's standard that's standard procedure and
[25:13.080 --> 25:18.240]  so the implication here is now the flu that's always been here is so deadly
[25:18.240 --> 25:23.640]  that you can't work basically anywhere they want to phase it in without taking
[25:23.640 --> 25:28.680]  any and all vaccines that the drug makers push on us even though last year we
[25:28.680 --> 25:34.360]  were confirmed to be exactly right about how it was ineffective dangerous and the
[25:34.360 --> 25:40.800]  flu itself was extremely weak and so this is the intimidation going on with
[25:40.800 --> 25:45.840]  basically people involved in the infrastructure in in hospitals in
[25:45.840 --> 25:51.960]  government police fire folks and it's just it's terrible they are attempting
[25:51.960 --> 25:57.360]  to force it on you but notice just like with public schools and colleges and
[25:57.360 --> 26:01.600]  hospitals they come to you up front and lie to you and don't even let you know
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.000]  there's an exemption to their policy itself not a law and they just say you
[26:06.000 --> 26:10.800]  must do it to make you feel like you're isolated and powerless the good news is
[26:10.800 --> 26:17.600]  they actually passed laws in Massachusetts and New York last year to
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.400]  make you take it but those laws were found to be unconstitutional and and
[26:23.400 --> 26:28.080]  other regulations were found to be illegal and unconstitutional so they're
[26:28.080 --> 26:32.960]  trying to make you do this but you know what you can print off just search the
[26:32.960 --> 26:41.160]  term study shows h1n1 shot lowers immunity doubles chances of contracting
[26:41.160 --> 26:45.680]  regular seasonal flu and you will get the Canadian the British and the US
[26:45.680 --> 26:50.240]  government's own studies that they found in trials last year that it actually
[26:50.240 --> 26:54.680]  lowers your immunity and increases your chance of getting the flu so how about
[26:54.680 --> 26:59.880]  you pass that out to other co-workers instead of see see see Carolyn we can't
[26:59.880 --> 27:03.560]  just individually fight this because then we're isolated we have to always get
[27:03.560 --> 27:09.200]  on the offensive and get others riled up about this so there's more of us we
[27:09.200 --> 27:13.880]  either push back against these people and get on the offensive or always on
[27:13.880 --> 27:16.720]  the defensive and are only going to lose ground you see what I'm saying
[27:16.720 --> 27:20.360]  yeah that's what's causing me crazy because I'm telling people stuff and
[27:20.360 --> 27:24.320]  I'm printing a bunch of junk off from from Mike Adams site he wrote so many
[27:24.320 --> 27:30.280]  good articles and in fact the mask doesn't work it doesn't even protect you
[27:30.280 --> 27:34.240]  against the flu virus no they had a great article on that the flu will the
[27:34.240 --> 27:38.080]  government admits that the flu virus is so small that no mask unless it's a full
[27:38.080 --> 27:42.720]  respirator over your whole face stops it or the virus just goes into your eyes
[27:42.720 --> 27:47.280]  but so let's but let's stop there if we search right now on the search engine
[27:47.280 --> 27:58.280]  study h1n1 vaccine doubles chances of getting regular flu you're not just
[27:58.280 --> 28:01.440]  gonna have Alex Jones or Mike Adams writing about it who are great guys you
[28:01.440 --> 28:06.560]  know my Mike's a great guy I I do my research you're gonna have the major
[28:06.560 --> 28:11.120]  government studies so that's a hundred percent fact how dare them try to give
[28:11.120 --> 28:15.880]  you a shot that destroys your immunity exactly and there's and all we need is
[28:15.880 --> 28:20.360]  to go out and get some sunshine well that is the vitamin D exactly there's no
[28:20.360 --> 28:25.520]  silver bullet but sunshine is the absolute total key I appreciate your
[28:25.520 --> 28:29.240]  call also getting a lot of other vitamins let's go ahead and talk to
[28:29.240 --> 28:35.160]  Jonathan and Kansas Jonathan you're on the air hey Alex yes sir I have some
[28:35.160 --> 28:43.120]  videos for you okay I have one of Terry Reed basically got flip flopping and
[28:43.120 --> 28:49.440]  basically this is a old video and let's see
[28:49.440 --> 28:56.400]  oh okay a lot can actually I'll get back to that but there's one on YouTube well
[28:56.400 --> 28:59.840]  just remember Jonathan a lot of people don't know who you're talking about Terry
[28:59.840 --> 29:05.400]  Reed was a CIA contractor at Mina with Bill Clinton and others when they were
[29:05.400 --> 29:10.120]  shipping in the cocaine and he wrote compromise Clinton Bush and the CIA and
[29:10.120 --> 29:13.880]  I interviewed him he's in my film police state to the takeover and he talks
[29:13.880 --> 29:22.520]  about government narcotics trafficking I meant Harry Reid senator basically well
[29:22.520 --> 29:29.840]  Henry Reed was basically saying that that he opposed birth birthright
[29:29.840 --> 29:34.760]  citizenship and basically it's on YouTube right now well of course he's
[29:34.760 --> 29:38.600]  always flip-flopping but but stay there I want you to finish your point Jonathan
[29:38.600 --> 29:43.840]  when we come back on the other side then we're gonna talk to Andre Perry Chris
[29:43.840 --> 29:50.840]  and others 1-800-259-9231 what's your take on all this election for us this
[29:50.840 --> 29:56.420]  admittedly we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the
[29:56.420 --> 30:03.360]  GCN radio network this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[30:03.360 --> 30:07.800]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[30:07.800 --> 30:11.840]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[30:11.840 --> 30:15.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[30:15.720 --> 30:19.760]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[30:19.760 --> 30:24.320]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[30:24.320 --> 30:28.320]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:28.320 --> 30:32.120]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[30:32.120 --> 30:35.720]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[30:35.720 --> 30:40.080]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[30:40.080 --> 30:43.240]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power

[32:09.320 --> 32:13.120]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[32:13.120 --> 32:17.800]  Americans at home. I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[32:17.800 --> 32:22.880]  and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as
[32:22.880 --> 32:27.880]  American citizens to pay attention. Full of the Republic identifies the enemies
[32:27.880 --> 32:32.960]  of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[32:32.960 --> 32:37.080]  and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner Bernanke their
[32:37.080 --> 32:40.880]  arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[32:40.880 --> 32:44.720]  do we make the check out to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[32:44.720 --> 32:50.760]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of fall of the

[33:01.080 --> 33:11.480]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic it's Alex Jones.
[33:11.480 --> 33:15.640]  Okay I'm gonna take 20, 30, 40 phone calls I'm gonna give each caller one
[33:15.640 --> 33:19.320]  minute I'm gonna try to not give you long-winded answers so we can get to the
[33:19.320 --> 33:24.400]  next person on the election the economy all of the electronic voting machine
[33:24.400 --> 33:29.640]  fraud coming out all over the nation mainstream headlines like you know a
[33:29.640 --> 33:35.760]  Democratic voter fraud pandemic I mean it is just everywhere it is out of
[33:35.760 --> 33:39.840]  control and the system is scared it came out last week that there are big
[33:39.840 --> 33:44.760]  memos inside the mainline Republican Party about how the rhinos plan on
[33:44.760 --> 33:48.840]  taking control of this Patriot Revolution so we're being attacked from
[33:48.840 --> 33:53.480]  two different angles but the big enemy is the establishment Democrats who
[33:53.480 --> 33:57.880]  openly support Obamacare the open borders and all the rest of it we need
[33:57.880 --> 34:01.800]  to take over the Republican Party and the Democratic Party and you see a lot
[34:01.800 --> 34:04.920]  of Democrats coming out and saying they're against Obamacare they're
[34:04.920 --> 34:11.160]  against open borders really starting to flip-flop and they're doing that because
[34:11.160 --> 34:15.480]  they're desperate and I've seen Democratic Party strategist on television
[34:15.480 --> 34:19.840]  praising this saying they're doing what they have to to win don't worry
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.600]  they're lying to people well if they are lying once they get into office we'll
[34:24.600 --> 34:29.080]  have them on record and we'll know this process of throwing the bombs out has
[34:29.080 --> 34:33.880]  just begun this is a major political realignment this is not business as
[34:33.880 --> 34:37.560]  usual and we're not going to extricate ourselves from this mess overnight it's
[34:37.560 --> 34:41.800]  going to take time now Jonathan you're talking about Harry Reid the head
[34:41.800 --> 34:49.280]  senator from Nevada in deep trouble way behind in the polls but magically in the
[34:49.280 --> 34:53.120]  most populous County magically the voting machines according to mainstream news
[34:53.120 --> 34:56.760]  we covered yesterday are flipping the votes you can't vote for Sharon Angle
[34:56.760 --> 35:00.880]  there but you were talking about a video I haven't seen this of saying he now
[35:00.880 --> 35:07.480]  opposes birthright anchor baby status no he does not a now opposed to been 1993
[35:07.480 --> 35:14.520]  he did type in to YouTube hypocrite Harry Reid and you find his hip Harry Reid
[35:14.520 --> 35:19.000]  saying that no same country would permit birthright citizenship so you have
[35:19.000 --> 35:24.120]  hypocrisy from him he'll take you say you're a racist or whatever but he held
[35:24.120 --> 35:28.080]  the same views at one time and he never really well Jonathan I appreciate your
[35:28.080 --> 35:33.960]  call hypocrite Harry Reid will YouTube it right now look Mexico shoots illegals
[35:33.960 --> 35:37.600]  that come into their country and I think that's wrong other Latin Americans
[35:37.600 --> 35:42.120]  Mexico is one of the most corrupt oppressive draconian nations on earth
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.720]  no country allows just unlimited illegal immigration and then allows their
[35:46.720 --> 35:50.840]  children to become citizens and gives them welfare the globalist want to do
[35:50.840 --> 35:55.320]  this to bankrupt the country remember the bankers like the debt to go up
[35:55.320 --> 36:00.840]  because they basically create this money out of nothing but then gain the whole
[36:00.840 --> 36:05.120]  world through the fraud and I know that all of you understand that but we have
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.240]  to get that message out to the general public doesn't matter what color you are
[36:09.240 --> 36:16.920]  with this country is going to Hades and a handbasket if we do not do something
[36:16.920 --> 36:20.880]  about the open borders now the globalist are four open borders hence I'm
[36:20.880 --> 36:25.880]  against it Andre in Florida you're on the air yeah I doing that looks on a
[36:25.880 --> 36:30.000]  long-term list my personal crawler welcome I was wondering thank you yeah I was
[36:30.000 --> 36:34.720]  wondering like you know if you know we could do as I trust legislation to break
[36:34.720 --> 36:37.800]  up some of these big companies wouldn't that do something to alleviate the
[36:37.800 --> 36:45.640]  unemployment well we get rid of like that go ahead no I was gonna say wouldn't
[36:45.640 --> 36:48.960]  that wouldn't we you know it's like 8 million people who are unemployed wouldn't
[36:48.960 --> 36:52.920]  we if we broke up companies like Time Warner and Bank of America wouldn't that
[36:52.920 --> 36:58.200]  do something to create you know create jobs for people it probably it probably
[36:58.200 --> 37:03.400]  would but the first companies that need to be broken up aren't Time Warner it's
[37:03.400 --> 37:08.320]  things like JP Morgan Chase it's companies like Bank of America it's
[37:08.320 --> 37:13.480]  companies like Goldman Sachs that's the top of the pyramid actually companies
[37:13.480 --> 37:17.160]  like Time Warner though I don't like them and their globalist actually hire a
[37:17.160 --> 37:23.720]  lot of people I mean the big the big oligopolies and and cartels that we
[37:23.720 --> 37:28.840]  have are the insurance companies and the big banks but that's a very good point
[37:28.840 --> 37:33.560]  Andre anything else yeah just that I was saying that they have a lot of influence
[37:33.560 --> 37:37.640]  you know based on the fact that they own so many subsidiaries they have so much
[37:37.640 --> 37:42.040]  control of media you know it's hard to get different opinions out into the you
[37:42.040 --> 37:46.440]  know out to the public now you're absolutely right and in speaking of
[37:46.440 --> 37:49.160]  another issue and I appreciate your call I was just looking at one of the
[37:49.160 --> 37:54.580]  headlines on info wars.com Sharon Engels top campaign lawyer has given a press
[37:54.580 --> 38:00.120]  conference openly saying Reed intends to steal this election and I agree we are
[38:00.120 --> 38:05.200]  seeing fraud right out in the open this is amazing in fact guys I didn't see
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.960]  that in my stack will you print that for me thank you it's one of the tiles on
[38:09.960 --> 38:14.920]  info wars.com thank you there's also a video that accompanies it there it is
[38:14.920 --> 38:23.080]  Las Vegas Sun angle campaign attorney Reed intends to steal this election if
[38:23.080 --> 38:27.800]  you can't win it outright let's go ahead and talk to Perry in Arizona Perry or
[38:27.800 --> 38:34.760]  on the air. Hey there how's it going. Good. Just a few points I'll go as fast as I can.
[38:34.760 --> 38:42.240]  Last year a couple days before Halloween I'm in the Phoenix metro area and the
[38:42.240 --> 38:47.520]  sky was absolutely pinstriped with the chemtrails and it was a few days before
[38:47.520 --> 38:55.200]  so how long does it take for that stuff to get down on the ground for our
[38:55.200 --> 38:58.840]  little toddlers to go trick-or-treating and they're kicking it up and they're
[38:58.840 --> 39:03.400]  lower you know and they're breathing all that aluminum in and and things like
[39:03.400 --> 39:10.720]  that so just for people to pay attention a couple days before Halloween to see if
[39:10.720 --> 39:14.520]  those stripes are gonna be doing that to our kids again and then I suggest to
[39:14.520 --> 39:18.860]  have Matt suit for a Halloween costume then if that's the case of course but
[39:18.860 --> 39:25.880]  you know I saw that what in the world are they spraying and you know the
[39:25.880 --> 39:29.400]  pilots can't keep flying the same missions over and over again you would
[39:29.400 --> 39:34.760]  think you know they would be affected with that aluminum too so do they
[39:34.760 --> 39:39.200]  transfer them a few days before they fall ill and die or you know who's
[39:39.200 --> 39:42.800]  flying these planes is what I the question that I have through watching
[39:42.800 --> 39:47.720]  that film and I think the bailout mark is where the money has come from for all
[39:47.720 --> 39:52.400]  this aluminum I don't know if that's true I have no basis for it
[39:52.400 --> 39:57.200]  I appreciate your call for those that don't know we're carrying the film what
[39:57.200 --> 40:01.120]  the world are they spraying dealing with the admissions of a giant secretive
[40:01.120 --> 40:07.080]  geoengineering campaign that's been going on for at least 16 17 years they
[40:07.080 --> 40:11.280]  kept most of it classified to the last two years and this stuff doesn't kill
[40:11.280 --> 40:16.920]  you overnight it builds up and bio accumulates in the body and that's why
[40:16.920 --> 40:21.280]  you're seeing degenerative diseases of the brain now striking more and more
[40:21.280 --> 40:25.760]  young people it's just epidemic levels it's part of a larger program and
[40:25.760 --> 40:28.720]  there's a lot of different programs that are going on in tandem but if folks
[40:28.720 --> 40:32.800]  want to get the DVD what in the world are they spraying it's available at
[40:32.800 --> 40:38.080]  info wars.com and I suggest you also see my film in-game blueprint for global
[40:38.080 --> 40:45.600]  enslavement you can also call toll free to get the film 888-253-3139 let's go
[40:45.600 --> 40:50.560]  ahead now and take another call here let's go ahead and talk to Chris in
[40:50.560 --> 40:57.360]  Georgia Chris you're on the air. Hi Alex yes incredible I keep looking for
[40:57.360 --> 41:02.120]  intellectual compromise on your part but I can't find any you're incredible
[41:02.120 --> 41:09.040]  listen about a couple things I'd like to ask but may not get time I do I am
[41:09.040 --> 41:15.840]  concerned about something that I feel that you're missing on the Obamacare
[41:15.840 --> 41:20.480]  subject and I feel like you covered you know the insurance that there's a scam
[41:20.480 --> 41:27.520]  that it all is fairly well but Nancy Lord was Ron Paul's running mate I believe
[41:27.520 --> 41:32.680]  in 1988 as vice president's will candidate and I heard her say one time
[41:32.680 --> 41:38.920]  at a table some years after that election she slandered the glass down on
[41:38.920 --> 41:46.960]  the table and said the American Medical Association is a criminal racket she is
[41:46.960 --> 41:54.160]  a medical doctor and a bar sanctioned attorney I am kind of wondering why I've
[41:54.160 --> 42:02.000]  never heard the word America phrase American Medical Establishment so you
[42:02.000 --> 42:05.080]  know discussed on your show and you talking about the inside workings of
[42:05.080 --> 42:11.040]  them Len Horowitz who you've had on there before has a whole history of the
[42:11.040 --> 42:17.600]  American Medical Association and sure hey hey Chris listen I don't know how
[42:17.600 --> 42:21.240]  often you listen to the show but we talk about the American Medical
[42:21.240 --> 42:24.960]  Association being on the payroll of the Rockefeller Foundation and others
[42:24.960 --> 42:28.880]  constantly we talk about how the average doctor means well in his
[42:28.880 --> 42:35.360]  compartmentalized and doesn't see the big picture and we just endlessly have
[42:35.360 --> 42:41.640]  medical doctors on like Russell Blalock, Sherri Tenpenny, Ron Paul himself to
[42:41.640 --> 42:46.840]  talk about the corruption in the medical system I've talked about the death
[42:46.840 --> 42:51.100]  panels I've talked about the insurance companies writing it writing the
[42:51.100 --> 42:55.280]  legislation I've talked about every facet you must be missing the show but I
[42:55.280 --> 43:01.360]  appreciate your call Chris I mean I can't really apologize for something I
[43:01.360 --> 43:04.200]  haven't done because you said I keep looking for you to be you know
[43:04.200 --> 43:10.120]  intellectually dishonest or something I don't know who cares who I am I mean I
[43:10.120 --> 43:14.240]  mean who cares I mean I know I'm a good person but what does that have to do
[43:14.240 --> 43:20.880]  with what we're all gonna do against this corruption I mean I'll be honest
[43:20.880 --> 43:25.360]  with you folks I'm exhausted today every second of this radio show is hell
[43:25.360 --> 43:31.960]  right now for me it's not like that most days but every once in a while you know I
[43:31.960 --> 43:35.440]  get really tired I probably only had eight nine hours sleep in the three days
[43:35.440 --> 43:44.920]  I was in California and I'm very tired and I'm here taking your phone calls
[43:44.920 --> 43:49.680]  covering the news you know I mean if I talk about a subsection of a bill you
[43:49.680 --> 43:54.240]  can go check it out it's up to you to go look it up if I talk about Jack Conway
[43:54.240 --> 43:57.480]  the Attorney General covering up for his brother and the and the detectives
[43:57.480 --> 44:00.880]  warning him and the detectives admitting they lied and the fact this is
[44:00.880 --> 44:03.800]  obstruction of justice I mean you can go read mainstream news articles were linked
[44:03.800 --> 44:09.600]  to if I talk about mortgage fraud and corruption you know we have experts on
[44:09.600 --> 44:15.320]  about it if I if I I mean here's an example of the type of stuff we cover
[44:15.320 --> 44:22.640]  okay research proves gender-bending chemicals affect reproduction and it
[44:22.640 --> 44:30.040]  gets into bisphenol a this is by University of Exeter okay and it says
[44:30.040 --> 44:36.480]  research proves gender-bending chemicals affect reproduction and then the
[44:36.480 --> 44:42.040]  university report goes on to add to all the other big stacks of reports and
[44:42.040 --> 44:47.840]  medical studies that bisphenol a feminizes boys and hyper feminizes
[44:47.840 --> 44:52.680]  girls it makes girls go into puberty early it makes boys go into it late and
[44:52.680 --> 44:59.080]  be feminized and they've done studies on frogs on alligators but also on
[44:59.080 --> 45:04.040]  mammals on guinea pigs and rats and I put a video out explaining that one
[45:04.040 --> 45:08.440]  reason men are feminized and get confused sexually I'm not saying in every
[45:08.440 --> 45:13.240]  case that's not the only reason you know I'm not even when I cover this I'm
[45:13.240 --> 45:19.960]  not even making a moral judgment I'm just stating what the research shows these
[45:19.960 --> 45:27.880]  chemicals in amphibians actually make them have both sexual organs and then
[45:27.880 --> 45:34.320]  they literally it had to be 75 or more articles a month ago demonizing yours
[45:34.320 --> 45:40.280]  truly for making you know these joke headlines Alex Jones says juice boxes
[45:40.280 --> 45:46.880]  make you gay no I warned parents and said bisphenol a lines most juice boxes
[45:46.880 --> 45:52.400]  and it will hurt your girls and hurt your boys and then I read studies about
[45:52.400 --> 45:57.840]  it and then it all becomes Alex Jones is a cuck, Alex Jones is a nut, Alex Jones
[45:57.840 --> 46:04.440]  says juice boxes make you gay all I did was read university reports about it
[46:04.440 --> 46:10.040]  giving women breast cancer, leading to men having testicular cancer, lowering
[46:10.040 --> 46:15.720]  men's normal testosterone, upping women's estrogen, but instead of all those
[46:15.720 --> 46:19.480]  people addressing something that's hurting them and their own families it's
[46:19.480 --> 46:24.880]  just easier to make a joke about Alex Jones so I don't care that's fine but
[46:24.880 --> 46:31.200]  it's like an imprinted thing in America that if anybody sticks their head up to
[46:31.200 --> 46:37.680]  warn anybody well let's judge them and it's just frustrating because all we
[46:37.680 --> 46:42.080]  talk about is how the American Medical Association is corrupt I mean you must
[46:42.080 --> 46:46.040]  have never listened to the show to make a statement like that but whatever I mean
[46:46.040 --> 46:49.760]  you got to call in and talk about it and again it's not that I don't like being
[46:49.760 --> 46:53.480]  criticized I could care less it's that I just don't get it I mean I just don't
[46:53.480 --> 46:59.520]  even understand it let's go ahead and talk to Kathy and Michigan Kathy you're
[46:59.520 --> 47:06.720]  on the air good morning Alex hi hi I'm a longtime listener and a first-time
[47:06.720 --> 47:12.200]  caller and I have a little thing here that I received and what you just said
[47:12.200 --> 47:17.360]  that's so true because people you know we know who's putting the kibosh on what
[47:17.360 --> 47:21.120]  you're saying and twist in the word so you know that that's just a given and
[47:21.120 --> 47:26.280]  you don't even need to spend waste your time talking about it I have this thing
[47:26.280 --> 47:32.840]  that we received in the mail we filled out the short form census and and then
[47:32.840 --> 47:37.160]  all of a sudden we get this thing in the mail and they want us to fill out the
[47:37.160 --> 47:42.040]  American Community Survey put out by the US Census Bureau and it's got to
[47:42.040 --> 47:46.160]  something questions what type of toilet do you have do your own guns there's
[47:46.160 --> 47:49.440]  different variants of it and under the Fifth Amendment you don't have to fill
[47:49.440 --> 47:52.720]  it out but let me guess it's got a little note on it threatening you with
[47:52.720 --> 47:59.720]  criminal penalties if you don't yeah title 13 US code all lies all lies it's
[47:59.720 --> 48:03.360]  been thrown out in federal court in 2000 thrown out in federal court this
[48:03.360 --> 48:08.760]  year it's a complete and total lies and no one's been prosecuted for it just all
[48:08.760 --> 48:13.960]  lies it's it's not real mm-hmm threaten you and impose a penalty for not
[48:13.960 --> 48:18.440]  answering the questions but there's some of the questions are so are you

[49:05.120 --> 49:08.680]  your house when it's paid for to see if they can get away with it or the
[49:08.680 --> 49:12.120]  Federal Reserve steals tens of trillions to see if they can get away with it and
[49:12.120 --> 49:17.520]  Jack Conway obstructs a narcotics investigation of his brother to see if
[49:17.520 --> 49:21.960]  he can get away with it they just see what they can get away with and I didn't

[54:00.880 --> 54:15.880]  we've got that Harry Reid clip in the mid 90s on the floor of the Senate
[54:15.880 --> 54:20.080]  talking about anchor babies and how insane it is I'm gonna get to that in a
[54:20.080 --> 54:29.320]  moment but I meant to get into this yesterday and later I'll tell the story
[54:29.320 --> 54:34.160]  more detail if I have time I don't go back to your phone calls but we flew out
[54:34.160 --> 54:39.320]  of California from our visit to Santa Cruz we flew into San Francisco and the
[54:39.320 --> 54:45.440]  lady at the rent car place was interrogating everybody for homeland
[54:45.440 --> 54:55.280]  security and then we flew out in San Jose they had naked body scanners in the
[54:55.280 --> 55:01.080]  security checkpoints and I sat there because Aaron had to unpack the cameras
[55:01.080 --> 55:04.440]  and stuff and then repack them to go through that took about 10 minutes and
[55:04.440 --> 55:08.160]  we got coffee and sat there for another 10 minutes right in front of the
[55:08.160 --> 55:12.520]  checkpoint watching who they ran through the naked body scanners I did not see
[55:12.520 --> 55:17.680]  one man run through it all I saw was women and I'm sure that's because they've
[55:17.680 --> 55:21.080]  had such a rebellion against it that's admitted that they know women are more
[55:21.080 --> 55:25.000]  compliant and I watched the women put their hands up and go in circles and be
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.800]  scanned it was the type where they stand between two machines and it beams them
[55:28.800 --> 55:33.880]  with the radiation and then I watched children five six seven years old put
[55:33.880 --> 55:40.880]  through it and it violates US child porn laws British child porn laws that's
[55:40.880 --> 55:45.760]  mainstream news but but it's one thing as I always say to intellectually know
[55:45.760 --> 55:51.240]  what these scanners are doing but to sit there and to watch it and to know the
[55:51.240 --> 55:55.000]  government stages the terror attacks to know it's all part of training us to do
[55:55.000 --> 56:03.400]  anything they tell us it was very painful and I had some TSA people walk over
[56:03.400 --> 56:07.600]  where I was sitting they had a coffee place right to the checkpoint while I
[56:07.600 --> 56:11.080]  sat there on a bench bugging their eyes out at me like why are you looking at
[56:11.080 --> 56:15.560]  this and I just didn't care and they went away I'm not supposed to watch them
[56:15.560 --> 56:21.480]  scanning the women and the women would pliantly smile and grovel and do whatever
[56:21.480 --> 56:29.600]  they're told I mean this this country is just in so much trouble and you're
[56:29.600 --> 56:33.680]  never putting my children through them ever I'm not going to submit I don't
[56:33.680 --> 56:37.320]  travel now on the airlines with my family because I'm not going to give you the
[56:37.320 --> 56:40.440]  chance to have your way with them and the government says that's fine mr. Jones
[56:40.440 --> 56:44.440]  we're putting them in all the state and federal courthouses mobile vans they're
[56:44.440 --> 56:47.600]  going to go in malls they're announcing we're going to make you bathe in
[56:47.600 --> 56:51.000]  radiation we're going to record your naked body we don't care what you say
[56:51.000 --> 56:54.280]  and we're going to go on staging terror attacks and blaming it on the American
[56:54.280 --> 56:59.920]  people you know that's the message and it's just going to get worse from here
[56:59.920 --> 57:04.480]  on out if we don't stand up and say no here's Harry Reid now he's all for anchor
[57:04.480 --> 57:11.080]  babies and open borders and amnesty but here he is in 1993 here it is if making
[57:11.080 --> 57:15.760]  it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough how about offering a reward for
[57:15.760 --> 57:22.440]  being an illegal immigrant no son no same country would do that right guess
[57:22.440 --> 57:27.280]  again if you break our laws by entering this country without permission and get
[57:27.280 --> 57:34.560]  birth to a child we reward that child with us citizenship and guarantee a full
[57:34.560 --> 57:39.600]  access to all public and social services this society provides and that's a lot of
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.400]  services is it any wonder that two-thirds of the babies born at taxpayer
[57:44.400 --> 57:51.440]  expensive country county run hospitals in Los Angeles are born to illegal alien
[57:51.440 --> 57:59.120]  mothers and if you say that today Harry Reid says you're a racist but there he
[57:59.120 --> 58:06.800]  was 1993 a new senator and that's how he got elected was talking like that but
[58:06.800 --> 58:11.040]  once he got in he's going along with the globalist plan to bring down this
[58:11.040 --> 58:16.800]  country we're in a fight for the hearts and minds the American people right now
[58:16.800 --> 58:23.600]  they're ready to be awakened like they've never been before and it's up to us to
[58:23.600 --> 58:29.480]  continue to expose these creatures and to reveal their hypocrisy and we're
[58:29.480 --> 58:33.000]  doing a great job of it you're doing a great job of it that's why they're
[58:33.000 --> 58:37.640]  moving to start shutting down the internet and free speeches we know it but
[58:37.640 --> 58:43.320]  I believe we're going to defeat these criminals stay with us thank you for

[1:01:03.880 --> 1:01:08.640]  taking your calls Lewis in Florida you're on the air hey Alex how you doing
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:13.840]  this is I'm just I'm a prison planet TV member and I think it's great I love it
[1:01:13.840 --> 1:01:18.800]  and I just want to let you know that remember a few weeks back when the CPS
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:26.960]  came and stole the Irish baby that made me so mad I went to Oath Keepers dot
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:32.280]  org and signed up to join that organization awesome maybe mad I got a
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:36.920]  question for you you know we got you talking about this possible internet
[1:01:36.920 --> 1:01:42.120]  censorship coming up what is to stop like Google right now from when you type
[1:01:42.120 --> 1:01:47.600]  in a search term and maybe I'm feeding you back bogus information or something
[1:01:47.600 --> 1:01:52.320]  well Google's already been caught doing things like that before but we know how
[1:01:52.320 --> 1:01:55.000]  they're going to shut the web down I mean they've said how they're going to do it
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:02:02.720]  taxes regulation prior constraint they're talking about forcing when you have one
[1:02:02.720 --> 1:02:08.720]  view where the government will superimpose via assistive whatever
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:13.000]  internet company you use government messages or corporate messages over it
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:17.760]  they're talking about taxing alternative media they're talking about passing
[1:02:17.760 --> 1:02:21.920]  laws where if something hurts someone's feelings there's no judge no jury you
[1:02:21.920 --> 1:02:26.880]  just get shut down or if a company claims copyright without going through a
[1:02:26.880 --> 1:02:32.080]  due process they shut not just your website down but ban your internet
[1:02:32.080 --> 1:02:36.640]  access for one year to five years and people say well how will they implement
[1:02:36.640 --> 1:02:39.840]  that Microsoft and others have announced with the government they want an
[1:02:39.840 --> 1:02:45.120]  internet ID where you have to enter an ID in to even get online on your cell
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:49.560]  phone your smartphone your computer your laptop where you won't be allowed to get
[1:02:49.560 --> 1:02:56.720]  online and this is the model they're going with okay I appreciate it thanks
[1:02:56.720 --> 1:03:04.280]  did that answer your question Lewis kind of but I mean if they can alter the
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:08.480]  search results at their at their will wouldn't that that's gonna be a bad
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:11.640]  thing too well that's why we need to get away from Google with some of the
[1:03:11.640 --> 1:03:15.400]  alternatives that are out there I appreciate your call Lewis good points
[1:03:15.400 --> 1:03:21.320]  Alan New York you're on the year okay thank you very much Alex thank you for
[1:03:21.320 --> 1:03:25.960]  all your great work thank you I something because I'm over 50 I remember
[1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:30.920]  something that maybe some of your other listeners might not have in their minds
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:38.200]  when they're looking at this incident with Lauren Valley and Rand Paul that
[1:03:38.200 --> 1:03:47.160]  that goes back to September of the 75 just watching this woman and and people
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:52.160]  restraining her reminded me of the squeaky from incident with Gerald Ford
[1:03:52.160 --> 1:04:00.680]  and it you know it's impossible to know when it's unfolding whether or not this
[1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:07.000]  woman is potentially a danger to the candidate or not and I think there's
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:11.320]  another thing to remember your instincts about maybe Rand Paul hunkering
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:17.240]  down and keeping a low profile until this election is probably a very good
[1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:22.480]  idea because not long after the squeaky from incident with Gerald Ford
[1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:27.920]  Sarah Jane Moore popped up and tried basically the same thing and they were
[1:04:27.920 --> 1:04:35.800]  able to get that close to the president or to a candidate because you know they
[1:04:35.800 --> 1:04:40.320]  didn't look threatening I tell you what Al stay there I want to come back for
[1:04:40.320 --> 1:04:43.400]  those that aren't sure what we're exactly talking about to recap what's
[1:04:43.400 --> 1:04:49.240]  happened with ran in the last few days and where you see this going but
[1:04:49.240 --> 1:04:53.320]  absolutely it looked like she was trying to make the car wreck I mean she was
[1:04:53.320 --> 1:04:56.840]  running up in the wind of throwing her sign in people grab her and take her to
[1:04:56.840 --> 1:05:04.560]  the ground and it's like oh my gosh I mean what do you expect is gonna happen
[1:05:04.560 --> 1:05:10.920]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really
[1:05:10.920 --> 1:05:15.840]  says that the state is God the United States is now recognized globally as one

[1:08:03.960 --> 1:08:09.440]  command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's
[1:08:09.440 --> 1:08:16.200]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network we're back live eight minutes into the
[1:08:16.200 --> 1:08:20.520]  second hour where we continue later in the broadcast covering a lot of election
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:24.520]  news and economic news interspersed with two different guests we have joining us
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:29.600]  dealing with mortgage fraud one of them is one of the most successful lawyers in
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:33.840]  the country according to the Wall Street Journal beating the mortgage companies
[1:08:33.840 --> 1:08:38.240]  over and over again in court the article if you want to read it is niche
[1:08:38.240 --> 1:08:43.640]  lawyers spawned housing fracas these are the people going back over the last five
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:47.800]  six years that have been trailblazing and discovering the fraud that they're
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:52.000]  the guys that discovered the robo-signing fraud in a deposition they
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:59.920]  just asked in one case going back now five years ago can we please see title
[1:08:59.920 --> 1:09:06.040]  and can we please see the loan review documents and they didn't have them and
[1:09:06.040 --> 1:09:11.200]  so that started down this path where you'll have one in some of the cases
[1:09:11.200 --> 1:09:15.600]  you know one bank official signing 10,000 foreclosures in a month and
[1:09:15.600 --> 1:09:20.560]  admittedly in court saying we don't read any of it we don't have deeds we don't
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:24.960]  have anything and that's how you have JP Morgan chasing Goldman Sachs in
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:29.080]  mainstream articles in court losing now because they're taking houses they don't
[1:09:29.080 --> 1:09:33.880]  even own much less have the deed to I mean this is the free for all and
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:38.480]  Congress is is is now announcing that they're trying they have passed a law
[1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:42.480]  Obama pocket vetoed it to laugh for the election meaning he didn't veto it he
[1:09:42.480 --> 1:09:47.560]  just set it aside he could sign it later where they can basically take any
[1:09:47.560 --> 1:09:52.080]  house for any reason and the end it's the end of property rights kind of like
[1:09:52.080 --> 1:09:55.360]  they use the banking crisis they created with derivatives to get a blank
[1:09:55.360 --> 1:10:00.400]  check to steal trillions in bailout and then this year they passed the banking
[1:10:00.400 --> 1:10:04.240]  reorganization act which gave the Federal Reserve even more power and the
[1:10:04.240 --> 1:10:08.760]  SEC more anonymity so they can't get in trouble for protecting Bernie made off
[1:10:08.760 --> 1:10:12.880]  another so that's coming up but I want to continue with your phone calls now if
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:20.680]  you just joined us Alan New York we're going back to him my gut level instinct
[1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:27.120]  last week and I and I talked about it on air was for Rand Paul to not go to the
[1:10:27.120 --> 1:10:32.320]  last debate his instinct to not go was smart because of new lies that Conway
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:36.080]  would put out on that big platform and because of what they might be waiting
[1:10:36.080 --> 1:10:41.400]  for him to do at the event and look I'm not for turning and running I'm always
[1:10:41.400 --> 1:10:46.480]  for challenging the enemy when it's on your terms but he's five to eight points
[1:10:46.480 --> 1:10:52.320]  ahead he's lost some points I've looked at a wide index of polls I talked to
[1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:56.840]  Ron Paul privately a few weeks ago and he said yes it looks like Rand's you know
[1:10:56.840 --> 1:11:01.160]  five six points ahead but they could pull some tricks so people you know need
[1:11:01.160 --> 1:11:04.640]  to know that and he didn't say it was off record he talked about it on air as
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:08.720]  well the point is he said he's worried about dirty tricks and things like that
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:15.560]  and we all are and there's election fraud as well Rand can do TV can do radio
[1:11:15.560 --> 1:11:21.520]  can do a lot of things I wouldn't make an announcement if I was him isn't the
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:25.920]  media will make a big issue of him hiding out but you know we're talking
[1:11:25.920 --> 1:11:33.680]  four days now Friday Saturday Sunday Monday four full days four and a half
[1:11:33.680 --> 1:11:39.360]  total till Super Tuesday and I have called the campaign I've talked to their
[1:11:39.360 --> 1:11:45.360]  people gave them my advice I have talked about it on air and I said don't go to
[1:11:45.360 --> 1:11:49.760]  that debate and I've said and and and quite frankly I would not be at a lot of
[1:11:49.760 --> 1:11:54.640]  big public events because you've seen what's happened to other candidates the
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:58.040]  system doesn't like it's not like Rand Paul is going to save the world on his
[1:11:58.040 --> 1:12:02.120]  own but he's a great candidate a great patriot I mean you've seen the
[1:12:02.120 --> 1:12:05.680]  Republicans come after him in the primary and pull out all the stops and
[1:12:05.680 --> 1:12:09.120]  have Dick Cheney campaign against him now Bill Clinton's there campaigning
[1:12:09.120 --> 1:12:13.480]  against him for the Democrat challenger Jack Conway you see the media
[1:12:13.480 --> 1:12:18.760]  literally blacking out huge news of Conway and his brother in clear
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:22.400]  obstruction of justice in narcotics investigations of his brother and
[1:12:22.400 --> 1:12:26.840]  tipping him off about a police raid this is confirmed they admit this but
[1:12:26.840 --> 1:12:30.320]  nothing's happening with it it's getting a little more attention because the
[1:12:30.320 --> 1:12:34.520]  number one search term we did yesterday and it's so important to get this out
[1:12:34.520 --> 1:12:39.600]  but my gut tells me as I said last week and I think this has been borne out that
[1:12:39.600 --> 1:12:44.240]  he needs to basically hide out and and and it's too close to the election for
[1:12:44.240 --> 1:12:48.360]  them to notice that or do anything about it quite frankly going out to little
[1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:52.880]  rallies and things is gonna maybe pick him up half a percentage point or
[1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:58.360]  something concentrating on doing local Kentucky radio he should be doing radio
[1:12:58.360 --> 1:13:02.400]  and I'll guarantee you they want him on radio he should be doing radio from 6
[1:13:02.400 --> 1:13:06.840]  a.m. in the morning till midnight that's the real power that's the listeners
[1:13:06.840 --> 1:13:12.200]  talk radio he should be putting press releases out on his views you know every
[1:13:12.200 --> 1:13:16.800]  hour he should be doing national television when it's friendly you know a
[1:13:16.800 --> 1:13:22.480]  few times a day not going all over Kentucky okay I think he's in danger I
[1:13:22.480 --> 1:13:26.480]  mean I don't mean just in danger of stunts being pulled on him this woman
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:31.080]  was wearing a wig runs up bus through security she's wearing a disguise she
[1:13:31.080 --> 1:13:35.880]  runs up to the rolling vehicle as it comes to a stop and is trying to cram the
[1:13:35.880 --> 1:13:40.600]  sign in to the open window on him and trying to reach in I mean what do you
[1:13:40.600 --> 1:13:45.080]  expect security people to think you've got a hot Senate campaign that's getting
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:49.560]  number one attention nationwide and somebody bus through runs in and the
[1:13:49.560 --> 1:13:53.160]  Ron Paul supporter three days ago said that's what she did the media said oh
[1:13:53.160 --> 1:13:57.960]  you're liars now the videos come out they told the truth now Alan New York was
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:03.760]  bringing up stuff that was done to Gerald Ford very similar to this but I'm
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:08.280]  thinking something more like you know what happened with a presidential
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:12.680]  candidate they didn't like right around that time and you remember he got shot
[1:14:12.680 --> 1:14:18.960]  and put in a wheelchair and so there's so many so many cases of this type of
[1:14:18.960 --> 1:14:24.120]  stuff and I'm telling you I'm telling you he's gonna win right now unless they
[1:14:24.120 --> 1:14:29.480]  can pull some bigger stunt or have a woman run up at an event he's giving
[1:14:29.480 --> 1:14:33.040]  and scream he raped me he raped me I mean there's no telling what they what
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:37.880]  they'll do and and I'm just I'm just really concerned for Rand Paul right
[1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:43.640]  now Alan New York make your points yes Alex thank you very much well looking at
[1:14:43.640 --> 1:14:49.240]  the video of this Lauren Valley she really had the same kind of a demented
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:55.680]  look that the Sarah Jane Moore and squeaky from had and you know the
[1:14:55.680 --> 1:15:02.760]  security people around Rand Paul shouldn't really hesitate if another
[1:15:02.760 --> 1:15:07.120]  incident happens because I know that they would probably err on you know the
[1:15:07.120 --> 1:15:11.440]  on the side of caution next time so that they couldn't be demonized but better
[1:15:11.440 --> 1:15:17.280]  better to be demonized and for something much worse to happen so I say if it
[1:15:17.280 --> 1:15:23.440]  happened again the same way react the same way and basically Alex thank you
[1:15:23.440 --> 1:15:27.480]  very much for your great work really appreciate it well you remember what
[1:15:27.480 --> 1:15:31.800]  happened to George Wallace and certainly I didn't agree with his politics but it
[1:15:31.800 --> 1:15:36.560]  was a similar free-for-all in the media and the media calling him a racist and
[1:15:36.560 --> 1:15:40.320]  all this stuff they're doing the same thing to Rand Paul you know the the
[1:15:40.320 --> 1:15:44.240]  liberals are always saying oh your rhetoric may cause violence what about
[1:15:44.240 --> 1:15:50.040]  their rhetoric causing violence well the double standard is really a
[1:15:50.040 --> 1:15:55.480]  striking because the the rhetoric on the other side has been far more extreme I
[1:15:55.480 --> 1:16:03.080]  think that Rand has been extremely considerate of everybody's feelings and
[1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:08.320]  I guess the reverse hasn't been true well you know that's another issue and I
[1:16:08.320 --> 1:16:11.200]  didn't try to call their campaign yesterday I figured listeners would get
[1:16:11.200 --> 1:16:15.040]  them word but I am able to get some of their senior people on the phone if I
[1:16:15.040 --> 1:16:19.520]  wait around for an hour they're all very busy but I mean they're smart they're
[1:16:19.520 --> 1:16:24.480]  not stupid Jesse Benton's not stupid I know him well and you know this is not
[1:16:24.480 --> 1:16:29.360]  dirty politics when they've been playing dirty on them with lies it's not dirty
[1:16:29.360 --> 1:16:35.280]  politics to go out and give a press conference dealing with Jack Conway
[1:16:35.280 --> 1:16:40.000]  blocking and warning his brother about a narcotics investigation and then the
[1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:43.640]  detectives lying about it and now admitting they lied about it and Jack
[1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:48.120]  Conway's brother lying about it I mean this is clearly obstruction shouldn't
[1:16:48.120 --> 1:16:53.640]  Rand Paul if he does anything you'll go on Fox or something and talk about this
[1:16:53.640 --> 1:16:58.560]  he could snap his fingers he's the only person that the media couldn't ignore and
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:03.280]  to put this out four days before an election and it will sink Jack Conway
[1:17:03.280 --> 1:17:07.400]  Jack Conway has gained a little on-ram with all these dirty tricks as there's
[1:17:07.400 --> 1:17:12.560]  useful idiots out there that'll believe anything and you know I don't I mean I
[1:17:12.560 --> 1:17:18.160]  understand Ron Paul and Rand Paul are super classy but it look the it's not
[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:23.320]  though classy when you've got Jack Conway obstructing justice I think they
[1:17:23.320 --> 1:17:26.840]  have a responsibility to come out and talk about it what do you think Al yeah
[1:17:26.840 --> 1:17:31.120]  I agree with you because I think when things are not aggressively
[1:17:31.120 --> 1:17:36.920]  responded to I think that they just sort of lied there and they fester and that
[1:17:36.920 --> 1:17:41.280]  that's the problem that we have they've thrown so much dirt that we really have
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:47.120]  to worry about the fact that you know the high road is something that I guess
[1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:52.760]  the the American electorate really doesn't understand I hope they understand
[1:17:52.760 --> 1:17:57.680]  it but maybe these things have to be aggressively responded to and I agree
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:03.480]  with you there Alex well you know they said high road back in 1992 not that
[1:18:03.480 --> 1:18:07.000]  George Herbert Walker was any better but the truth's the truth and they didn't
[1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:10.920]  get into whitewater and cocaine dealing and raping women that was all known
[1:18:10.920 --> 1:18:14.800]  about Bill Clinton then it should have been brought out then and Bill Clinton's
[1:18:14.800 --> 1:18:19.760]  clearly positioning Jack Conway as a presidential run later we need to shut
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:25.960]  down Jack Conway now not later I agree with you I think that if not ran
[1:18:25.960 --> 1:18:29.960]  himself in his surrogates could should come out and expose the story I think
[1:18:29.960 --> 1:18:35.160]  that this is the biggest story of the campaign what you've uncovered is
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:39.080]  absolutely fantastic well to be clear I uncovered something hidden in plain view
[1:18:39.080 --> 1:18:44.320]  and didn't see it till Tuesday morning on the tarmac it's at 6 30 a.m. and was
[1:18:44.320 --> 1:18:47.760]  reading the courier journal and other reports that were directly quoted from
[1:18:47.760 --> 1:18:51.640]  the police reports and and they interviewed the detectives who admitted
[1:18:51.640 --> 1:18:54.680]  they got tipped off admitted they had meetings with Conway's brother the
[1:18:54.680 --> 1:18:58.800]  attorney general admittedly that they covered all this up and admittedly they
[1:18:58.800 --> 1:19:03.360]  told him a SWAT team raid was coming we have them it's over I mean if they
[1:19:03.360 --> 1:19:08.600]  simply expose this it's over for Jack Conway and Matt Conway his brother I
[1:19:08.600 --> 1:19:13.880]  mean his brother already had to resign his his his prosecutor role because of
[1:19:13.880 --> 1:19:18.680]  this what does that tell you well you're the one who connected the dots the
[1:19:18.680 --> 1:19:23.680]  newspaper I guess really hasn't doesn't have a vested interest in connecting the
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:27.920]  dots but the Paul a campaign certainly does well I'm surprised the newspaper
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:33.200]  even ran with it because the that particular paper is giving money to
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:36.720]  Conway and has been supportive of him and that's why they didn't put it Conway
[1:19:36.720 --> 1:19:40.320]  in the headline they didn't point out that it was Conway's brother till deep in
[1:19:40.320 --> 1:19:43.600]  the article they didn't but but look at least they did their job we talked to
[1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:47.040]  the reporter last night and he doesn't want to come on the show he says he
[1:19:47.040 --> 1:19:50.920]  doesn't do media interviews he says he lets his article speak for themselves
[1:19:50.920 --> 1:19:54.920]  so we at least appreciate the writer alright Al thanks for the call Barney

[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:22.760]  9-11 investigation challenges media dealing with the 3,000 dead there I want
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:28.480]  to go back to your phone calls let's talk to Barney in Texas Barney you're on
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:32.680]  the air thanks for holding thanks for taking my call Alex I know you've
[1:24:32.680 --> 1:24:38.400]  covered Google in for many years but I wanted to bring out a recent article that
[1:24:38.400 --> 1:24:43.600]  I didn't hear you mentioned yet it's from fastcompany.com they came out
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:50.440]  Google just came out with a new think tank called Google ideas and they hired
[1:24:50.440 --> 1:24:56.640]  Jared Cohen formally from the State Department working under Condoleezza
[1:24:56.640 --> 1:25:04.360]  Rice to head up this new think tank and in this article it explains that this
[1:25:04.360 --> 1:25:08.160]  new think tank of course will take on the greatest problems in the world and
[1:25:08.160 --> 1:25:13.000]  but also it's going to be part of counterterrorism and fighting terrorism so
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:19.280]  admittedly for the first time that I've seen Google is now working with the
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:24.520]  government to fight terrorism so that's it's very alarming given to the access
[1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:29.480]  of all the information they have on every American citizen and so now if they
[1:25:29.480 --> 1:25:33.120]  find something on an American citizen there they have the right now to come
[1:25:33.120 --> 1:25:36.680]  out and say well we said we were gonna start fighting terrorism and work with
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:41.240]  the government so now people you know they can open the give their Google
[1:25:41.240 --> 1:25:45.880]  admittedly is working with the Pentagon on software that quote predicts the
[1:25:45.880 --> 1:25:50.320]  future and it's pre-crime and the federal government today just announced
[1:25:50.320 --> 1:25:54.760]  they're closing in a spying investigation by Google on its users and
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:26:00.400]  as Drudge Report has the headline you know free to spy Google free to spy and
[1:26:00.400 --> 1:26:07.400]  so you know Google is clearly an NSA slash CIA front they now basically admit
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:11.880]  that Barney good points I appreciate your call Joe in Texas you're on the
[1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:17.680]  year hello Alex are you broke good Alex I'm just calling out I talked to you
[1:26:17.680 --> 1:26:23.000]  before there's a gunsmith up in Texas and I came across an article it kind of
[1:26:23.000 --> 1:26:28.440]  ties in with the internet where we kind of had a victory over the EPA and trying
[1:26:28.440 --> 1:26:34.680]  to take away like the traditional ammunition where the yeah they're not
[1:26:34.680 --> 1:26:38.520]  just gonna ban selling lead they're gonna make you turn it in which is all
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:42.680]  the stockpiled lead and so now they have an excuse to confiscate all your ammo
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:49.560]  but it's for the environment Joe and I know that's been defeated for now the
[1:26:49.560 --> 1:26:53.840]  point is that they're trying to ram this through and even when Congress said no
[1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:58.600]  to the greenhouse gas taxes notice that the EPA is just going ahead with it so
[1:26:58.600 --> 1:27:05.000]  that's the danger but go ahead Joe they well it said in this article just said
[1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:08.240]  they had the recent victory in the national shooting sports foundation
[1:27:08.240 --> 1:27:13.720]  against the EPA where they proposed this ban and the power you always talk about
[1:27:13.720 --> 1:27:20.280]  Alex about the power of the internet and people several I mean just thousands
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:26.320]  of people they said got on Facebook and websites and they beat this proposal
[1:27:26.320 --> 1:27:31.600]  and so you know we had a short victory but and that's why the other reason I'm
[1:27:31.600 --> 1:27:36.640]  calling him is is because of if we got this kind of power on the net like you
[1:27:36.640 --> 1:27:41.040]  talk about all the time Alex what this this stuff they're doing with Rand Paul
[1:27:41.040 --> 1:27:48.440]  and things like that through the internet and your websites Alex but my
[1:27:48.440 --> 1:27:53.560]  concern is how they're and I had a question is my concern is that when
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:28:00.840]  they tried to with the voter fraud and would your your thought be Alex with
[1:28:00.840 --> 1:28:06.200]  them pushing all this stuff over the mainstream media news of the voter
[1:28:06.200 --> 1:28:10.600]  fraud don't you think Alex or do you think that they're trying to dissuade the
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:16.720]  public and even voting yes and and the system is trying to push their whole
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:20.000]  agenda through as fast as possible because they know people are waking up
[1:28:20.000 --> 1:28:23.520]  so they're just trying to overwhelm us with the cyber security act and the
[1:28:23.520 --> 1:28:28.480]  election fraud and the open borders and the amnesty and the wars and the naked
[1:28:28.480 --> 1:28:34.560]  body scanners and the flu shots that's the system panicking to the awakening
[1:28:34.560 --> 1:28:39.240]  trying to just totally break our will and have us capitulate to them but it's
[1:28:39.240 --> 1:28:44.120]  not gonna work because if the economy was doing great and people still had
[1:28:44.120 --> 1:28:48.480]  plenty of money and plenty of bobbles they might go along with this but the
[1:28:48.480 --> 1:28:53.040]  bankers have so greedily destroyed the economy while lying and telling us the
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:56.720]  recessions over when even mainstream media is having to admit now it's really
[1:28:56.720 --> 1:29:01.160]  a depression the recession never ended they're gonna have trouble selling this
[1:29:01.160 --> 1:29:05.040]  because they've been caught lying so much and and that's their problem the
[1:29:05.040 --> 1:29:10.040]  alternative media has so discredited them that that no one buys anything they
[1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:15.040]  say anymore and so the mainstream media still has some power but it's like a
[1:29:15.040 --> 1:29:19.560]  bucket with holes in the bottom it's rapidly dissipating there they can
[1:29:19.560 --> 1:29:27.000]  feel their their power going away the people's power surging and intensifying
[1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:32.400]  great points Joe Steve John Ronnie Bill and others your calls are coming up but
[1:29:32.400 --> 1:29:37.440]  we've got a lawyer coming on from a law firm that's been having real success

[1:30:08.720 --> 1:30:12.920]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:16.960]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[1:30:16.960 --> 1:30:20.840]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[1:30:20.840 --> 1:30:24.960]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[1:30:24.960 --> 1:30:29.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:33.560]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[1:30:33.560 --> 1:30:37.280]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[1:33:28.040 --> 1:33:34.600]  detailed I've seen yet titled niche lawyers spawned housing fracas and it's
[1:33:34.600 --> 1:33:39.480]  got a list of four or five law firms going back the last six years that
[1:33:39.480 --> 1:33:44.920]  discovered the robo signing because of depositions they were doing with lenders
[1:33:44.920 --> 1:33:49.800]  with banks that that that they were engaged in in in breaking all of these
[1:33:49.800 --> 1:33:54.400]  laws and procedures and so we've got one of the lawyers on one of the most
[1:33:54.400 --> 1:34:00.720]  successful law firms Dustin A. Zaks with the ICE law firm Mr. ICE is the founder

[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:20.440]  frozen all foreclosures because they've been caught with their pants down their
[1:34:20.440 --> 1:34:27.320]  hands in the cookie jar so we're going to him Dustin A. Zaks here in just a

[1:36:44.080 --> 1:36:47.600]  all of you of all the mainstream articles I've seen the best is this
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:53.680]  Wall Street Journal Robbie Whalen article niche lawyers spawned housing
[1:36:53.680 --> 1:36:58.720]  fracas and it goes through what is it four or five law firms that first started
[1:36:58.720 --> 1:37:04.200]  having the big victories and it goes through some of the basic reasons these
[1:37:04.200 --> 1:37:09.200]  mortgage companies are in so much trouble things like not having the deeds or
[1:37:09.200 --> 1:37:14.120]  not reviewing the foreclosure documents though I mean these are serious issues and
[1:37:14.120 --> 1:37:17.440]  that's how you hear about homes that are paid for being taken or two or three or
[1:37:17.440 --> 1:37:20.840]  four banks trying to foreclose on the same house because they were all put in
[1:37:20.840 --> 1:37:27.520]  these derivative pools breaking the chain of custody breaking the the common
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:32.760]  law private property issues and and they quote here in deep research in the
[1:37:32.760 --> 1:37:38.080]  Wall Street Journal as the economy frayed bankruptcy clients appeared Mr.
[1:37:38.080 --> 1:37:42.320]  Ice would help them with chapter 13 filings that enable individuals with
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:44.960]  the judge's blessings to get rid of credit card car payment and other debt
[1:37:44.960 --> 1:37:48.840]  but the law didn't let judges reduce someone's mortgage searching for a way
[1:37:48.840 --> 1:37:52.600]  to defend clients facing foreclosure this is what Randy Kelton's been saying
[1:37:52.600 --> 1:37:58.200]  for two years Mr. Ice began researching English case law and the history of
[1:37:58.200 --> 1:38:04.960]  property rights he ran across Sheldon versus Hentley 18 1680 case that said
[1:38:04.960 --> 1:38:09.600]  an indebted merchant owes his debt to the person who lent him the money not to
[1:38:09.600 --> 1:38:13.560]  a debtor collector who came around bearing a note and we have that of
[1:38:13.560 --> 1:38:18.640]  course in our common law here as well so joining us for the next 20 minutes or
[1:38:18.640 --> 1:38:25.760]  so is Dustin a zax of the ice law firm and tell us about your firm tell us
[1:38:25.760 --> 1:38:29.800]  about yourself and the discoveries you've had and all the amazing victories
[1:38:29.800 --> 1:38:33.680]  you've been having in these court cases sir well thanks for having me Alex
[1:38:33.680 --> 1:38:37.120]  first you know I've been with the firm a couple years now well since really the
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:41.600]  height of the crisis and it's really surprising every day bring something new
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:45.600]  that the banks are doing and trying to get away within court you know ranging
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:51.240]  from as you covered there's affidavit that have been clearly perjured there
[1:38:51.240 --> 1:38:56.160]  have been actual law firm submitting that same kind of documentation and then
[1:38:56.160 --> 1:39:00.400]  there's case after case where as you say when they sold these loans they simply
[1:39:00.400 --> 1:39:05.080]  don't have the proof that the loan was sold and that the party who's suing my
[1:39:05.080 --> 1:39:08.680]  client actually owns these loans and a lot of that has to do with the
[1:39:08.680 --> 1:39:14.560]  securitization process and correct me if I'm wrong but if Congress changes the
[1:39:14.560 --> 1:39:18.840]  law like they tried to do two weeks ago and Obama signs it he did pocket veto it
[1:39:18.840 --> 1:39:25.680]  this would really damage private property law here because the way this law
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:29.640]  was written they're saying well it doesn't matter if they put into a pool or
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:36.480]  have they used these new digital deed systems that have been proven to be
[1:39:36.480 --> 1:39:41.560]  fraudulent that's okay if they say that the banks are allowed to do this well
[1:39:41.560 --> 1:39:45.920]  this is going to be dangerous well the bill dealing with notarization is
[1:39:45.920 --> 1:39:50.440]  troubling you know at notarization is you know the requirement for several
[1:39:50.440 --> 1:39:54.360]  reasons one of them being there's supposed to be some kind of seriousness
[1:39:54.360 --> 1:39:59.040]  when you sign your name to a document and in my case is I'm seeing assignments
[1:39:59.040 --> 1:40:03.760]  of mortgages you know documents that purport to transfer my client's mortgage
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:08.480]  or you know a note in many of those cases when you have to notarize them there
[1:40:08.480 --> 1:40:12.760]  have been problems and we have taken a deposition at someone at a law firm down
[1:40:12.760 --> 1:40:19.080]  here who admitted that their notaries were actually going back and notarizing
[1:40:19.080 --> 1:40:23.800]  these documents as if they had signed them six months ago so to accept
[1:40:23.800 --> 1:40:28.640]  blindly a notary from another state you know as this law would have allowed them
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:32.560]  to you know again that raises all kinds of problems well this article also deals
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:36.400]  with the discovery of robos shining can you break that down for us yeah of
[1:40:36.400 --> 1:40:41.120]  course a lot of times what we'll see as the only evidence in a case against us
[1:40:41.120 --> 1:40:45.320]  it's going to be an affidavit that affidavit says many things but among
[1:40:45.320 --> 1:40:49.720]  them that the plaintiff whether it's the Deutsche Bank US bank or whoever owns
[1:40:49.720 --> 1:40:54.640]  this loan they're entitled to foreclose and that my clients always certain
[1:40:54.640 --> 1:41:00.600]  amount of money and they also state under oath mind you that they've looked at
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:04.320]  all the books and records they've looked at all the servicing documents and they
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:08.080]  are sure that you know everything is correct in the case and what do you know
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:11.720]  when I go ahead and take the deposition of someone you know whether it's at one
[1:41:11.720 --> 1:41:17.800]  West Bank or at G Mac or a bird chase home finance they admit freely and
[1:41:17.800 --> 1:41:21.440]  without much pushing that they didn't look at a single document prior to
[1:41:21.440 --> 1:41:26.000]  signing these affidavit in fact in the Wall Street Journal they have quotes
[1:41:26.000 --> 1:41:31.360]  from the affidavits and now other law firms go and depose the very same
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:33.880]  people get depositioned from the same people you've talked to and they
[1:41:33.880 --> 1:41:37.960]  admit it again absolutely it doesn't seem to be a lot of remorse from these
[1:41:37.960 --> 1:41:41.720]  folks I think they just assumed that was their job and you know to give you the
[1:41:41.720 --> 1:41:46.560]  scale the employee at G Mac was signing 10,000 documents a month we took
[1:41:46.560 --> 1:41:50.240]  somebody at one West who was signing similarly thousands of documents
[1:41:50.240 --> 1:41:53.520]  between just a few employees and the field is very similar a chase home
[1:41:53.520 --> 1:41:58.200]  finance as well now to be specific correct me if I'm wrong if they go into
[1:41:58.200 --> 1:42:06.640]  court and they have a lawyer for the firm or for the bank or or or even a
[1:42:06.640 --> 1:42:09.960]  lawyer that they've just you know hired separately as a contractor he gets up and
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.360]  swears and puts in a filing saying we've we've checked everything we've done
[1:42:14.360 --> 1:42:18.680]  everything we own this and then in many cases it turns out they don't even have
[1:42:18.680 --> 1:42:23.360]  the deed and you've got multiple banks suing to get the same house because
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:27.880]  it's all been put into one big pool with derivatives I mean isn't that
[1:42:27.880 --> 1:42:33.680]  basically lying to the court isn't that engaging in fraud I mean under law how
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:38.280]  do you quantify what they're doing well the sale of it is staggering you know
[1:42:38.280 --> 1:42:42.480]  you figure take just the one employee at G Mac under oath you're absolutely right
[1:42:42.480 --> 1:42:46.920]  he is stating to the court I personally looked at these documents and you know
[1:42:46.920 --> 1:42:51.760]  10,000 documents a month there's no way it's humanly possible for him to have
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:55.880]  looked through 10,000 foreclosure cases to verify that everything was correct so
[1:42:55.880 --> 1:42:59.680]  the best way to equate it is you know picture if that had happened at a trial
[1:42:59.680 --> 1:43:03.640]  where I had that gentleman on the stand I mean that would be a an astounding
[1:43:03.640 --> 1:43:09.760]  admission you know that he didn't look anything so it is fraud you know there
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:14.040]  are Attorney General all across the nation getting involved now and
[1:43:14.040 --> 1:43:20.760]  investigating the robo signers and as I say you know our job is to bring that
[1:43:20.760 --> 1:43:25.240]  in front of the court the courts have a wide variety of things they can do to
[1:43:25.240 --> 1:43:29.760]  punish the bank but among them is to throw out their entire case now now
[1:43:29.760 --> 1:43:34.320]  studying property law just just on the surface obviously you know a lot more
[1:43:34.320 --> 1:43:38.520]  about it than I do but talking to other lawyers we've had on air but I've even
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:43.520]  seen cases with you know some of my cousins and people who buy a piece of
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:49.840]  ranch property but then back 50 years ago somebody didn't execute a title
[1:43:49.840 --> 1:43:55.320]  right or there was some fraud involved with somebody you know three four
[1:43:55.320 --> 1:43:59.960]  owners before and then someone comes against them in court brings that up
[1:43:59.960 --> 1:44:06.000]  in court they lose and it reverts back to the point of the original fraud and
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:10.640]  so I mean if this is happening then it looks like the banks I mean if the
[1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:15.440]  courts serve justice are going to lose all these houses then the question is
[1:44:15.440 --> 1:44:19.680]  who really owns them now you're exactly right I did ramifications of the
[1:44:19.680 --> 1:44:25.160]  fraud and the robo signing you know our huge all these these homes that were
[1:44:25.160 --> 1:44:28.920]  foreclosed on should they have a document in them that it that it judge
[1:44:28.920 --> 1:44:33.680]  relied on absolutely that's ground to reverse the judgment out so the bank
[1:44:33.680 --> 1:44:37.600]  looking at all kinds of liability number one from the obviously the people who
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:42.160]  were foreclosed out the people who lost their home next from a title company
[1:44:42.160 --> 1:44:47.360]  and next from people who may have bought these foreclosed home that was my
[1:44:47.360 --> 1:44:51.680]  next issue when I was getting out about the ranch property because I mean a lot
[1:44:51.680 --> 1:44:55.040]  people like I don't care my house isn't in trouble I got plenty of money but
[1:44:55.040 --> 1:44:59.560]  wait a minute what if you bought a house from a bank or from a company and it's
[1:44:59.560 --> 1:45:03.760]  something that they'd foreclosed on two three years ago fraudulently what's
[1:45:03.760 --> 1:45:07.480]  going to happen to them well that's the problem I mean that's why I say the bank
[1:45:07.480 --> 1:45:10.560]  have already started to make announcements about how much money they're
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:15.520]  putting aside for potential litigation you know rising from these issues and
[1:45:15.520 --> 1:45:20.800]  it's in the billion it's clear that you know it's kind of having a domino effect
[1:45:20.800 --> 1:45:24.880]  that's happening in all 50 states and you know I wouldn't be surprised to see
[1:45:24.880 --> 1:45:29.480]  more lawsuits in addition to the few we've seen come out recently but no
[1:45:29.480 --> 1:45:33.160]  absolutely you buy a foreclosed home you're assuming you get good title you
[1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:37.800]  have the title checked out you know it's not your responsibility to check if
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:42.160]  somebody was lying to the court in thousands of affidavit now now what's
[1:45:42.160 --> 1:45:46.400]  this system that they started using the last five years it's called mirrors can
[1:45:46.400 --> 1:45:51.040]  you can you tell us about that yeah real quick the basic idea is as you were
[1:45:51.040 --> 1:45:54.680]  saying earlier about property law there's a lot of requirements where you have to
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:58.560]  record transfers of property so that the next person who buys it is unnoticed
[1:45:58.560 --> 1:46:01.640]  you know who the prior owners were and you can check to see if there were any
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:06.600]  problems what mirrors did is they saved the lenders a lot of money and it was
[1:46:06.600 --> 1:46:11.240]  created by lenders it was created in part by fanny and freddy and government
[1:46:11.240 --> 1:46:16.880]  entities and what it does is it eliminates the need for you to record a
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:23.440]  transfer of the mortgage for a deed of trust so whereas you know before if you
[1:46:23.440 --> 1:46:26.800]  were a u.s. bank and you had loaned someone the money you owned the mortgage
[1:46:26.800 --> 1:46:30.520]  if you wanted to transfer that state to put it in a trust like that and during
[1:46:30.520 --> 1:46:34.720]  the height of this you would actually have to go down to the courthouse record
[1:46:34.720 --> 1:46:38.920]  that assignment with the court so that's very expensive very tedious what
[1:46:38.920 --> 1:46:45.800]  Merz does is it prevents that need and basically Merz is a straw man as we call
[1:46:45.800 --> 1:46:50.760]  it illegal parlance and they basically if you look at your mortgage if it's a
[1:46:50.760 --> 1:46:55.840]  Merz loan Merz is listed as the mortgagee Merz is the person who owns your
[1:46:55.840 --> 1:47:02.280]  mortgage but it's not properly executed at the courthouse so in common sense
[1:47:02.280 --> 1:47:06.360]  that it means it's not legitimate well what it means is it's just not
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:10.240]  transparent the whole purpose of making the bank go down to the courthouse and
[1:47:10.240 --> 1:47:14.000]  record assignment so everybody's on notice you can see who owns your loan
[1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:19.280]  and in Merz case you know they could have sold your loan 20 times and you might
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:23.960]  never know you might never know about it because it's still listed as Merz this
[1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:27.280]  electronic and so that was developed so they could sell it into the derivatives
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:32.400]  pool well developed to save them money when they did that and it saved them you
[1:47:32.400 --> 1:47:36.440]  know millions and millions up until this point but then that facilitated the
[1:47:36.440 --> 1:47:40.200]  fraud of mortgages being sold over and over again and chopped up in different
[1:47:40.200 --> 1:47:45.160]  pieces sir briefly what are some of the other frauds that you're finding what
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:50.640]  are some of the you know other things that the banks are doing that you've
[1:47:50.640 --> 1:47:55.560]  discovered well big one is relating to the securitization selling these loans
[1:47:55.560 --> 1:48:01.000]  you know into trust is they seem to be either unable or unwilling to produce
[1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:05.240]  documents that would prove that a lot of these loans actually got into the trust
[1:48:05.240 --> 1:48:09.320]  so you know we hear a lot about sloppiness in terms of what they're
[1:48:09.320 --> 1:48:15.040]  finding the court now but it seems like that's blackiness and that that failure
[1:48:15.040 --> 1:48:20.080]  to file all the necessary paperwork that was happening during the height of the
[1:48:20.080 --> 1:48:24.120]  crisis during the height of when these loans were being sold 10 times and what
[1:48:24.120 --> 1:48:28.280]  I mean by that is to prove that a loan got into a truck you've got to have all
[1:48:28.280 --> 1:48:33.000]  kinds of receipts all kinds of certifications to verify that you
[1:48:33.000 --> 1:48:37.000]  know this loan is listed as an asset in that truck and when we ask for that
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:41.560]  documentation it's like staring into a black hole you know they just don't have
[1:48:41.560 --> 1:48:45.800]  the documentation or they don't want to produce it so that's another potential
[1:48:45.800 --> 1:48:52.720]  liability for the bank down the line sir I mean again this is a layman my gut
[1:48:52.720 --> 1:48:56.960]  is this is endangering our entire private property system that's worked so
[1:48:56.960 --> 1:49:01.240]  well and it made this country such a mecca for investment I mean do you
[1:49:01.240 --> 1:49:05.280]  agree that that this is starting I mean just from your research to really
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:09.920]  threaten the entire private property system you know I do think it goes to
[1:49:09.920 --> 1:49:14.040]  that scale as I said it's hundreds of thousands of false documents filed in all
[1:49:14.040 --> 1:49:20.480]  56 so the scale that is staggering the arrogance that the bank's had to file
[1:49:20.480 --> 1:49:24.480]  these you know it's really you know as an attorney I take that very seriously and
[1:49:24.480 --> 1:49:28.280]  it's kind of insulting they just figured no one would catch them you know when
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:31.520]  they were lying to the courts repeatedly well why are you according to Wall
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:36.040]  Street Journal one of the first law firms ICE legal and there's a few other
[1:49:36.040 --> 1:49:40.640]  before you going back about four years why are you guys so smaller law firms
[1:49:40.640 --> 1:49:45.120]  the first ones to think to even look at this I mean where are the big mega law
[1:49:45.120 --> 1:49:48.520]  firms out there who have clients that are buying ten million dollar houses you
[1:49:48.520 --> 1:49:52.960]  think they would want to know about this that's true I mean the problem has been
[1:49:52.960 --> 1:49:56.440]  naturally that most of these cases are not defended and that's what you know
[1:49:56.440 --> 1:50:00.440]  let the banks get away with this for so long the vast majority of homeowners who
[1:50:00.440 --> 1:50:04.640]  are in distress though because of the economy you know just don't have the
[1:50:04.640 --> 1:50:08.880]  means to hire an attorney so what we did is we went out on a limb you know
[1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:13.200]  actually funded our own deposition you know in most of your big time
[1:50:13.200 --> 1:50:16.440]  litigation at big firms a lot of times the clients will put the bill for all
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:21.560]  the discovery to find out things like fraud in our case you know we kept
[1:50:21.560 --> 1:50:25.560]  seeing the same names over and over and over and we said boy wouldn't be
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:29.760]  curious to see this gentleman who's signing so many of the documents and
[1:50:29.760 --> 1:50:35.000]  just our few hundred cases if he's actually doing a new diligent can you
[1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.080]  stay with us for five more minutes on the other side
[1:50:37.080 --> 1:50:40.920]  okay I want to come back and ask you where you think all this is going the

[1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:14.120]  because there's a war on for your mind well you get four or five little law
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:19.000]  firms they start fighting the big mega banks that are winning because the big
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:23.480]  of mega banks are completely arrogant and it shows how when you let big mega
[1:54:23.480 --> 1:54:28.800]  corporations run wild you end up destroying your nation turning into a
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:31.920]  third-world country because of business and the average person can't be
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:38.880]  protected your nation disintegrates and Dustin A. Zaks with ICE legal one of the
[1:54:38.880 --> 1:54:42.760]  firms that's been winning in court and blocking these people and really
[1:54:42.760 --> 1:54:47.640]  exposing the fraud I mean the Wall Street Journal talks about a lot of your
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:52.960]  successes but but briefly recap some of those for folks well sure you know we
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:56.880]  brought the light a lot of the practices that are now being investigated by
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:02.840]  attorneys general all over the US and you know it's exciting to see and other
[1:55:02.840 --> 1:55:06.480]  attorneys are picking up on it and bringing other practices to light that
[1:55:06.480 --> 1:55:11.480]  you know we didn't even know about so you know crazy times but again as an
[1:55:11.480 --> 1:55:15.040]  attorney I never thought people would be submitting fraudulent documents by the
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:19.480]  thousands to court as evidence so well I mean look at Goldman Sachs and JP
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:22.640]  Morgan getting a lot of the bailout money and their representatives won't
[1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:26.960]  tell Congress where the money went I mean these people are bandits well it
[1:55:26.960 --> 1:55:31.200]  seems like you know the troubling aspect for me is how the third people aren't
[1:55:31.200 --> 1:55:35.200]  even in trouble with their home you know a lot of people think the bank screwed
[1:55:35.200 --> 1:55:39.240]  it up the first time around you know not doing their due diligence that kind of
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:43.880]  thing well this is on the default side of it you know this is on the you know
[1:55:43.880 --> 1:55:47.200]  litigation side of it and it seems like they're screwing it up again but to the
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:52.080]  extent that this prevents housing recovery or you know has effects for
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:56.520]  people who are not in foreclosure you know that's twice that seems like they
[1:55:56.520 --> 1:56:00.480]  haven't done a whole lot of good for it well I'd like to get you or mr. I've
[1:56:00.480 --> 1:56:04.920]  saw in the next few weeks to talk about I mean I know you can't diagnose cases
[1:56:04.920 --> 1:56:08.280]  over the telephone or over the radio but you know what the you know the
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:13.000]  average person can do when they're facing you know one of these mortgages
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:17.320]  how do they detect or analyze and and find out if there is fraud in their
[1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:22.520]  mortgage I would guess that ice legal is overwhelmed right now yeah I'm pretty
[1:56:22.520 --> 1:56:27.280]  busy even busy up yep are you guys taking on more clients we sure are yeah
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:31.440]  we're mainly in Florida you know so we're happy to speak to anyone facing
[1:56:31.440 --> 1:56:34.880]  foreclosure related issues down of course give us the website for ice legal
[1:56:34.880 --> 1:56:41.240]  sure thing www.icelegal.com I see legal.com now well I just want to help
[1:56:41.240 --> 1:56:44.480]  people and I'm gonna get as many law firms and other groups on that are
[1:56:44.480 --> 1:56:48.480]  having success as I can because a hundred thousand foreclosures a month I
[1:56:48.480 --> 1:56:52.880]  mean my goodness yeah the scale of it again it's it's staggering the best
[1:56:52.880 --> 1:56:56.600]  thing folks can do is get educated speak to an attorney whether it's us or
[1:56:56.600 --> 1:57:00.640]  anybody you know go ahead and have someone look at your documents to see if
[1:57:00.640 --> 1:57:05.040]  somebody's Robo signers were signing things for just to see if there's a
[1:57:05.040 --> 1:57:08.320]  fishy thing going on yeah but your firm's actually helping people I've been
[1:57:08.320 --> 1:57:12.600]  studying this for years looking at it people calling me about it listeners
[1:57:12.600 --> 1:57:15.520]  wanting me to investigate and a lot of law firms either don't have your
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:19.480]  expertise or lazy and they just take your money and then they end up taking the
[1:57:19.480 --> 1:57:23.080]  people's houses but the law firms listed here in the Wall Street Journal they've
[1:57:23.080 --> 1:57:26.480]  been keeping people in their houses for four years I mean and and and having
[1:57:26.480 --> 1:57:30.360]  victories well that's the key you're gonna want somebody who has actually
[1:57:30.360 --> 1:57:35.440]  litigation experience a lot of but I would say maybe real estate closing
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:39.960]  attorneys or something like that aren't actual litigators who do motions and
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:43.440]  take depositions and go to full trials every day but that and they're playing
[1:57:43.440 --> 1:57:47.560]  golf with the local brokerage firm the local title company the local banker
[1:57:47.560 --> 1:57:53.960]  yeah yeah well you know it's a it's a small legal world we've got one minute
[1:57:53.960 --> 1:57:59.760]  left where do you see this ending just in your gut you know it's very tough to
[1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:03.000]  say but I would say with the State Attorney General investigating it's
[1:58:03.000 --> 1:58:08.160]  hard to see how some criminal charges are not going to result down the line
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:13.600]  whether that you know in a few months or or years it's hard to imagine there's
[1:58:13.600 --> 1:58:17.080]  not gonna be any criminal repercussions for this kind of thing well Mr. Zaks
[1:58:17.080 --> 1:58:20.960]  again I would like to get you or Mr. Ice back on for a full hour I know you're

[2:00:13.200 --> 2:00:20.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[2:00:20.720 --> 2:00:26.480]  Alex Jones well you just heard a lawyer from one of the top law firms beating
[2:00:26.480 --> 2:00:30.480]  the daylights out of the corrupt banks on the mortgages this affects the entire
[2:00:30.480 --> 2:00:34.920]  economy this affects foreclosed houses you bought or a house that another
[2:00:34.920 --> 2:00:40.520]  company foreclosed on and then sold you so we're going to be discussing what
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:44.440]  this means to the entire economy coming up with Randy Kelton after the next
[2:00:44.440 --> 2:00:47.760]  segment I want to get into other economic news in the next segment I need
[2:00:47.760 --> 2:00:50.360]  to clear the phone lines out we're gonna try to take a few of the guys that are
[2:00:50.360 --> 2:00:53.960]  holding right now because I want to then open the phones up just on mortgage for
[2:00:53.960 --> 2:00:57.680]  how to take your questions but you just heard a law firm winning in court over
[2:00:57.680 --> 2:01:02.080]  and over again basically repeat everything Randy Kelton said and expand on
[2:01:02.080 --> 2:01:05.280]  it to say yeah we love the other people that are investigating this because
[2:01:05.280 --> 2:01:09.040]  they're finding even more fraud I mean it just it just we're gonna go deep into
[2:01:09.040 --> 2:01:12.920]  this with Randy Kelton coming up part three of interview we started a few
[2:01:12.920 --> 2:01:17.800]  weeks ago but I wanted you to hear from actual lawyers saying the same thing but
[2:01:17.800 --> 2:01:20.680]  Randy goes even further in his research and he's actually advising a lot of
[2:01:20.680 --> 2:01:24.960]  lawyers right now because they just don't know how to research it but let's go
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:30.680]  to Steve in Texas Steve you're on the air go ahead yes thank you I was very
[2:01:30.680 --> 2:01:36.920]  chilling I bought my property five years ago and I've paid for it and I've
[2:01:36.920 --> 2:01:40.960]  gotten the country in rural areas people are having homes taken that are
[2:01:40.960 --> 2:01:46.400]  completely paid for because you know 11 years ago when this new fraud began they
[2:01:46.400 --> 2:01:50.800]  foreclosed on somebody improperly so you may not have clear titles somebody
[2:01:50.800 --> 2:01:55.360]  may come take it you better investigate we did it I paid quite a bit for a title
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:02:01.040]  search before I even got the property and isn't that the liability of the title
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:06.320]  company yes yes yes but the banks don't care they just bypassed the title
[2:02:06.320 --> 2:02:10.360]  company and still try to take it but now because you know this information you'll
[2:02:10.360 --> 2:02:14.000]  be able to block them but for the general public that doesn't see this isn't
[2:02:14.000 --> 2:02:17.720]  just about people who are having been foreclosed on blocking it this is about
[2:02:17.720 --> 2:02:22.560]  people that have been defrauded by the banks blocking their foreclosure I mean
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:25.920]  I already have all my receipts so everything I paid the mortgage mortgage
[2:02:25.920 --> 2:02:31.040]  company and you know I mean it's supposedly in my mind clearly Russian
[2:02:31.040 --> 2:02:35.120]  roulette I mean go back to the person before you or before I mean were they
[2:02:35.120 --> 2:02:42.920]  was it a foreclosure down the road somewhere well that was part of the
[2:02:42.920 --> 2:02:48.920]  job of the time that's the fraud with these digital systems that aren't in
[2:02:48.920 --> 2:02:54.400]  the courthouse is it allows that to all be the muddied
[2:02:54.400 --> 2:03:01.360]  oh god I've got to say this Alex this is I've been with you for about a year I've
[2:03:01.360 --> 2:03:06.600]  got the info wars calm and present play I mean TV and present plan calm and
[2:03:06.600 --> 2:03:11.360]  everything and manage a college education and it's like now at least 50% of
[2:03:11.360 --> 2:03:15.560]  my time but I got to tell you I'm a study of American history you are the
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:19.480]  number one American hero in my book I just want you to know that's what I mean
[2:03:19.480 --> 2:03:23.600]  and I pray for you every day and I thank you well Steve God bless you God bless
[2:03:23.600 --> 2:03:28.440]  you look I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my grandmother's prayers 85 years
[2:03:28.440 --> 2:03:32.680]  old if it wasn't for all the people that pray for us there is no doubt I got
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:38.080]  guardian angels and I'm not the number one hero number one heroes are firefighters
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:41.720]  that run into burning buildings to save children and the chimney collapses on them
[2:03:41.720 --> 2:03:46.840]  and kills them number one heroes even though they're misguided or troops that
[2:03:46.840 --> 2:03:52.280]  charge machine gun nest you know the number one heroes out there are police
[2:03:52.280 --> 2:03:58.240]  officers that go up against drug thugs the number one heroes are our people
[2:03:58.240 --> 2:04:02.360]  like Joe Bannister who exposes the fraudulent IRS and they indicted them
[2:04:02.360 --> 2:04:09.320]  and he beat them in court I am somebody who recognized tyranny 17 years ago
[2:04:09.320 --> 2:04:15.080]  spent two years trying to get on air got on air on access TV got on radio got
[2:04:15.080 --> 2:04:20.920]  syndicated did everything I do to expose the corruption I live eat drink
[2:04:20.920 --> 2:04:26.600]  sleep this information and it doesn't mean we're always right doesn't mean we
[2:04:26.600 --> 2:04:30.880]  have all the answers we're just trying to learn trying to do good trying to resist
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:35.080]  corruption trying to figure it out and that's a big difference from people that

[2:08:23.280 --> 2:08:27.440]  John Bill and Chris and a few others before our next guest is going to be in
[2:08:27.440 --> 2:08:32.440]  studio and we've got for prisonplanet.tv viewers some graphs we're going to be
[2:08:32.440 --> 2:08:37.240]  showing here on television then this will be archived at prisonplanet.tv and
[2:08:37.240 --> 2:08:40.600]  from there pumped out of the four four wins but we're going to go through a
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:44.880]  lot dealing with this mortgage fraud but this was only the beginning of the
[2:08:44.880 --> 2:08:49.040]  fraud to the international derivatives bubble and this affects everyone this
[2:08:49.040 --> 2:08:53.680]  affects most people's mortgages even if you bought your house you have five ten
[2:08:53.680 --> 2:08:57.840]  eleven years ago when they changed the Glass-Steagall Act this doesn't mean
[2:08:57.840 --> 2:09:01.160]  just if you're upside down or they're trying to foreclose on you that you're
[2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:05.120]  the only ones being targeted this is anybody that owns a house because the
[2:09:05.120 --> 2:09:09.120]  title companies and these computerized systems are completely filled with fraud
[2:09:09.120 --> 2:09:13.080]  and that's how banks every day I read about trying to take houses that are
[2:09:13.080 --> 2:09:16.240]  paid for that they don't even have a note for because they bought derivatives
[2:09:16.240 --> 2:09:22.520]  that say they have your house okay so I mean this is just amazing and you heard
[2:09:22.520 --> 2:09:25.680]  that lawyer earlier saying they've just found the tip of the iceberg of the
[2:09:25.680 --> 2:09:29.720]  fraud and that's already stopping most of the foreclosures I wanted to get into
[2:09:29.720 --> 2:09:34.880]  some other news is that a Bloomberg JP Morgan HSBC accused of manipulating
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:39.160]  silver futures they've been accused of investor lawsuit of placing spoof trade
[2:09:39.160 --> 2:09:43.920]  orders to manipulate silver futures and opinions prices in violation of US
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:47.760]  antitrust law that's been coming out for a long time we had the gold antitrust
[2:09:47.760 --> 2:09:52.360]  group gata on a few months ago first telling you about that also in Reuters
[2:09:52.360 --> 2:09:56.800]  French protest again on pensions but fatigue ways that's what the IMF wrote
[2:09:56.800 --> 2:10:01.200]  about in 2002 in Argentina they said they found that people may riot for six
[2:10:01.200 --> 2:10:05.800]  months they like that that drives down confidence even more then they finally
[2:10:05.800 --> 2:10:10.840]  burn out the economy is imploded then they come in and consolidate the French
[2:10:10.840 --> 2:10:15.560]  need to start calling for prosecutions of the bankers that have looted them not
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:19.400]  running around throwing fits demanding their taxes not be raised they need to
[2:10:19.400 --> 2:10:24.320]  get rid of the bankers and get rid of that system here's another one American
[2:10:24.320 --> 2:10:28.400]  job loss is permanent dr. Paul Craig Roberts breaks down that they've shipped
[2:10:28.400 --> 2:10:34.160]  our jobs out by design employers in US start bracing for higher tax withholding
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:37.960]  oh yeah and and all the new insurance money you got to pay for your employees
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:43.880]  and all the new taxes I mean I don't even know if I can coming up the next
[2:10:43.880 --> 2:10:47.680]  year of all this Obama tax stuff goes in and all this new Obamacare goes in I'm
[2:10:47.680 --> 2:10:52.200]  having a look at my great crew every one of them is important and decide how do I
[2:10:52.200 --> 2:10:56.200]  raise the money to keep them here to pay for all this or do I let people go I
[2:10:56.200 --> 2:11:00.200]  mean this is happening all across the economy California is set to pass a 20
[2:11:00.200 --> 2:11:04.480]  percent carbon tax this week they're trying to repeal it it kicks in next
[2:11:04.480 --> 2:11:08.600]  year they're trying to repeal it next Tuesday I'm looking at the poll numbers
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:12.560]  it's 50 50 it's neck and neck can you imagine what's gonna happen to
[2:11:12.560 --> 2:11:16.600]  California if there's a 20% tax slapped on all the businesses that produce
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:23.680]  carbon the factories huh I mean you think 22% unemployment that's admitted in
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:29.240]  California 60 minutes reports you think 22% unemployment you ain't seen
[2:11:29.240 --> 2:11:34.600]  nothing yet they want to destroy the economy and they use the cheap labor
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:40.480]  from Mexico to do it as well so employers start bracing for higher tax
[2:11:40.480 --> 2:11:43.560]  withholding employers in the US are starting to warn their workers prepare
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:46.880]  for slimmer paychecks if Congress fails to vote on extension of the Bush era
[2:11:46.880 --> 2:11:51.920]  tax cuts you know that's the thing the establishment has trained everybody that
[2:11:51.920 --> 2:11:56.760]  if you got a neighbor make a $200,000 a year they're rich or even a
[2:11:56.760 --> 2:12:02.040]  million dollars a year they're rich no true wealthy people make billions a year
[2:12:02.040 --> 2:12:06.360]  and they're the ones lobbying for higher taxes to then pay the money into
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:10.080]  government for banker bailouts and defense contractor money they're all
[2:12:10.080 --> 2:12:16.520]  offshore what was the ABC news headline last Thursday Google pays in fact guy
[2:12:16.520 --> 2:12:25.760]  search the term Google pays 2.5% tax okay okay I pay on average about 40%
[2:12:25.760 --> 2:12:32.040]  they claim it's 35% tax bracket baloney okay 40% now it's going up even more
[2:12:32.040 --> 2:12:34.920]  then there's all the other taxes and the FICA and the rest of it and the
[2:12:34.920 --> 2:12:42.840]  unemployment insurance and all the new taxes Texas has passed now Google the
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:48.120]  biggest company in the world I'm sorry I was wrong it's 2.4 I said 2.5 I'm sorry
[2:12:48.120 --> 2:12:59.560]  Google has a 2.4% rate they pay 2.4% tax rate you got to love that can you
[2:12:59.560 --> 2:13:04.880]  imagine what info wars calm and prison planet calm and my operation could do if
[2:13:04.880 --> 2:13:12.360]  we were paying 2.4% federal income tax can you imagine see this is all
[2:13:12.360 --> 2:13:16.320]  engineered to shut down the little guy let me explain something to people that
[2:13:16.320 --> 2:13:21.160]  work at a restaurant you know waiting tables making $35,000 a year or
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:25.800]  somebody mowing lawns making $35,000 $40,000 a year oh yeah that they make
[2:13:25.800 --> 2:13:29.960]  that well not only is all this devaluation a currency going to kill
[2:13:29.960 --> 2:13:34.640]  any savings or what you can buy your purchasing power but but what do you
[2:13:34.640 --> 2:13:39.440]  think happens when somebody making $125,000 a year that's what the tax
[2:13:39.440 --> 2:13:44.040]  increases kick in for if you actually read the legislation what do you think
[2:13:44.040 --> 2:13:47.520]  happens when somebody has to pay more money they have to cut pay they have to
[2:13:47.520 --> 2:13:50.920]  lay people off they've got the healthcare taxes coming in on top of it
[2:13:50.920 --> 2:13:54.960]  they've got a real estate tax in the healthcare bill of 5% on the real
[2:13:54.960 --> 2:14:00.720]  estate a house you own or rent what's that gonna do see it's the people making
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:06.360]  $125,000 a year that pay for babysitters that go to restaurants that go to the
[2:14:06.360 --> 2:14:11.160]  mall and buy clothes that go to the car dealership and buy cars they're the
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:14.600]  people that go to your salon and get their hair done they're the people that
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:18.600]  go to your gym and get a membership they're the people that produce almost
[2:14:18.600 --> 2:14:25.480]  all the service jobs left in this country and guess what you can look at
[2:14:25.480 --> 2:14:29.200]  the graphs as dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy at the Treasury
[2:14:29.200 --> 2:14:35.760]  wrote today the middle class is shrinking dramatically it's about half of what it
[2:14:35.760 --> 2:14:42.120]  was 30 years ago so there goes your economy and the system knows this they
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:46.280]  cut taxes on the middle class the economy races but they don't want that
[2:14:46.280 --> 2:14:56.200]  they want to shut it down I know I'm ranting here it's just horrible it's
[2:14:56.200 --> 2:15:01.680]  absolutely horrible and the internet accounts for 7.2% of British economy
[2:15:01.680 --> 2:15:05.200]  study fines French news agency but they're coming out with internet taxes in
[2:15:05.200 --> 2:15:11.040]  England we can't build infrastructure anymore New Jersey's canceling all this
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:14.640]  infrastructure because almost all the money has to go for service on the debt
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:17.880]  everybody always talks about welfare moms and how they're bankrupting us and
[2:15:17.880 --> 2:15:21.320]  how illegal aliens are bankrupting us and that's certainly part of it but
[2:15:21.320 --> 2:15:24.560]  that's the dependent group that votes to bring in big governments of the bankers
[2:15:24.560 --> 2:15:28.880]  get two-thirds of the money in debt service and who owns the debt the
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:32.880]  Chinese government and then the private fellow reserve they're the two biggest
[2:15:32.880 --> 2:15:37.720]  owners Chinese number one Federal Reserve number two it's all a stinking
[2:15:37.720 --> 2:15:44.400]  fraud I want to bring Ted Anderson up gold they tried to hammer it down we've
[2:15:44.400 --> 2:15:47.640]  got it right here in Bloomberg with a manipulation of silver manipulation of
[2:15:47.640 --> 2:15:52.440]  gold that they can't hold it down holds up four times what it was 10 years ago
[2:15:52.440 --> 2:15:58.760]  but Ted when it went down $25 he bought a bunch now it's gone up 15 bucks he
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:02.640]  could sell it to you at that discounted amount Ted this is incredible economic
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:06.520]  news coming out it sure is you know like when you and I were sitting out there a
[2:16:06.520 --> 2:16:11.360]  KCS so the G20 was beaten up on the US dollar and it was dropping and golden was
[2:16:11.360 --> 2:16:15.560]  racing upward and we have that going on again today but now they're awaiting
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:20.600]  this announcement by the Fed next week they're expecting the Fed to take newly
[2:16:20.600 --> 2:16:24.920]  printed money and to buy 80 to a hundred billion dollars worth of assets and
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:29.040]  that's going to drive them we already seen it the dollars just crumbling right
[2:16:29.040 --> 2:16:36.440]  now gold is up $18.60 right now presently seen a high today of 1346 90
[2:16:36.440 --> 2:16:41.840]  already silver just broke again $24 an ounce I mean the whole thing is
[2:16:41.840 --> 2:16:45.200]  starting to move back where you know back up to where it was it's almost like
[2:16:45.200 --> 2:16:48.760]  you know there's just these one or two maybe three days where gold and silver
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:52.640]  will make a correction and then it just comes racing back up I liked your
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:56.880]  analogy with trying to hold a beach ball underwater because that's exactly how
[2:16:56.880 --> 2:17:01.320]  this is acting you'll see it correct a little bit and then boom it comes right
[2:17:01.320 --> 2:17:05.280]  just like the frauds coming out on the mortgages the fraud of them suppressing
[2:17:05.280 --> 2:17:09.160]  gold and silver which should both be both be double what it is now for 1980
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:12.640]  inflation as that fraud comes out they're not going to be able to engage in it
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:17.000]  yeah right about that and so that creates the opportunities that we have in the
[2:17:17.000 --> 2:17:22.480]  gold and silver because of the fact that the the exposure of the of this elite
[2:17:22.480 --> 2:17:26.040]  group that has been trying to suppress the prices of gold and silver for years
[2:17:26.040 --> 2:17:31.920]  you know it first of all you can't beat the United States dollar down without
[2:17:31.920 --> 2:17:37.200]  having its equal commodity go up you know the golden silver you can't print
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:41.480]  golden silver like you can print us dollars and so they're they're having
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:45.960]  to accelerate the printing press and that's driving the prices of gold and
[2:17:45.960 --> 2:17:50.400]  silver up and they can't control they can no longer hold on to the price of
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:55.040]  gold and keep it low like they did back in the middle 1980s well to simplify the
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:17:58.760]  Chinese aren't buying as much of it so the Federal Reserve is moving towards
[2:17:58.760 --> 2:18:04.320]  being the biggest owner of US t-bills and other other instruments which
[2:18:04.320 --> 2:18:09.040]  positions the bankers leave more power so they're buying our debt but they're
[2:18:09.040 --> 2:18:13.560]  using our money to buy it for themselves and then we're supposed to pay this back
[2:18:13.560 --> 2:18:18.320]  with tax money and it devalues our money so they're taxing us two different ways
[2:18:18.320 --> 2:18:21.520]  Ted we got a minute and a half left before I come back with Randy Kelton in
[2:18:21.520 --> 2:18:25.440]  the mortgage fraud and more phone calls break down today's golden silver
[2:18:25.440 --> 2:18:29.240]  specials for folks yeah sure Frank's with the forecaster currently right now
[2:18:29.240 --> 2:18:36.200]  at 293 British sovereigns are at $367 a piece the new fifth edition creature

[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:25.000]  we are back live for 30 minutes in the last hour we had Dustin a zax on from
[2:24:25.000 --> 2:24:29.200]  ice legal who's in the wall street journal beating the banks and they've
[2:24:29.200 --> 2:24:32.520]  got what four other law firms here that discovered the robo signing and have
[2:24:32.520 --> 2:24:36.280]  been deposing these people and as he said the fraud goes a lot deeper than
[2:24:36.280 --> 2:24:39.680]  just what they've discovered he says they but it was exactly what pro se
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:44.160]  litigant Randy Kelton's been saying for several years now with his
[2:24:44.160 --> 2:24:48.880]  information that they go in they lie and they say we've got clear title to this
[2:24:48.880 --> 2:24:53.160]  and they don't but this affects people who bought houses even if two three
[2:24:53.160 --> 2:24:57.520]  sales before it was ever in foreclosure so this affects basically
[2:24:57.520 --> 2:25:02.280]  everybody and they now want to bail this out they're talking about five trillion
[2:25:02.280 --> 2:25:05.760]  ten trillion or more and they're going to try to do that in the lame duck
[2:25:05.760 --> 2:25:11.200]  congress coming up or after that next year they have suspended the big five
[2:25:11.200 --> 2:25:15.720]  banks including Bank of America two weeks ago all foreclosures just because
[2:25:15.720 --> 2:25:20.760]  lawyers and pro se litigants have just begun to fight now now Randy we're gonna
[2:25:20.760 --> 2:25:25.120]  have you here for the rest of this hour and into the fourth hour in overdrive on
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:28.200]  our AM and FM affiliates and prison planet dot TV and the streams and info
[2:25:28.200 --> 2:25:32.080]  wars dot com I can't do this all the time but the next few minutes we are
[2:25:32.080 --> 2:25:36.760]  posting an info wars dot com and prison planet dot com a free video box so
[2:25:36.760 --> 2:25:40.520]  people can see this just like when I had governor Ventura on yesterday we were
[2:25:40.520 --> 2:25:43.760]  playing video clips it's so important for radio listeners to also be able to
[2:25:43.760 --> 2:25:48.600]  see this as we go through all these big color graphs with documentation that
[2:25:48.600 --> 2:25:53.840]  you put together we're gonna be showing on the document cam today actually I
[2:25:53.840 --> 2:25:58.720]  may move it out here so my shadows not on it maybe tilt the camera that way so
[2:25:58.720 --> 2:26:03.540]  we can not have my shadow on it but we're gonna be showing that to the
[2:26:03.540 --> 2:26:09.040]  viewers but but what did you think of ICE legal who's been deposing the banks
[2:26:09.040 --> 2:26:12.360]  beating their socks off saying clearly the same things that you've basically
[2:26:12.360 --> 2:26:17.360]  been talking about I think it took an incredible amount of courage for a law
[2:26:17.360 --> 2:26:25.320]  firm to take on these big banks and ask judges to render rulings that were new
[2:26:25.320 --> 2:26:29.600]  to the judges judges hate to do that no judge wants to be the one to change the
[2:26:29.600 --> 2:26:32.920]  law because he doesn't want to be the one to have his case thrown but the
[2:26:32.920 --> 2:26:37.160]  banks weren't following law so yeah but to get a judge to make a ruling that
[2:26:37.160 --> 2:26:41.040]  different from what he's been doing is really tough and it took a lot of
[2:26:41.040 --> 2:26:45.040]  courage for these attorneys to do that because an attorney can get a lot of
[2:26:45.040 --> 2:26:49.000]  trouble asking a judge to render a ruling he doesn't want to rule on so I
[2:26:49.000 --> 2:26:55.840]  have to give them credit but the political climate is changing dramatically
[2:26:55.840 --> 2:27:02.200]  it's what we expected back in March when the legislature allotted 200 million
[2:27:02.200 --> 2:27:05.880]  to the feds to start going after these guys that just before the election they'd
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:09.280]  drop the sky on them and that's exactly what they've done well the law firms in
[2:27:09.280 --> 2:27:12.160]  this Wall Street Journal article they were actually having victories five years
[2:27:12.160 --> 2:27:16.480]  ago and they first discovered Robo signing four years ago but it didn't get
[2:27:16.480 --> 2:27:20.560]  any news attention right now people are taking what these law firms have done
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:25.720]  successfully and duplicating it and as mr. Zach said they are finding even more
[2:27:25.720 --> 2:27:32.400]  types of fraud just like you said right we have a recent case in California one
[2:27:32.400 --> 2:27:36.120]  in Nevada Arizona and Tennessee it started in Tennessee it was a new one
[2:27:36.120 --> 2:27:43.960]  this week this one was a quietam action quietam is a suit to recover funds that
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:48.160]  were defrauded from the government you file a quietam if you win you get to
[2:27:48.160 --> 2:27:53.040]  keep 25% of what you recover unless the government steps in and takes over in
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:57.560]  which case you only get to keep 10 what the guy claimed was is all of these
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:28:02.160]  sales of the security instrument had not been filed with the clerk of the court
[2:28:02.160 --> 2:28:08.080]  he sued in Tennessee and named every court clerk in the state of Tennessee as
[2:28:08.080 --> 2:28:15.160]  a defect as a plaintiff claimed 34 million in fees not rendered to those
[2:28:15.160 --> 2:28:21.440]  clerks guy in Arizona Nevada and now in California picked it up dying
[2:28:21.440 --> 2:28:28.080]  California also claimed the five to ten thousand dollar fines for not filing so
[2:28:28.080 --> 2:28:32.880]  this is really bringing them serious problems now do they have standing I
[2:28:32.880 --> 2:28:37.880]  mean were they the ones being foreclosed on no as under a quietam action it's the
[2:28:37.880 --> 2:28:41.280]  whistleblower act it's like a bounty against corruption exactly if you can
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:46.800]  find any government agency or official that's misappropriating public funds you
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:50.800]  can sue under a quietam action to recover those funds and they use a kind of
[2:28:50.800 --> 2:28:54.480]  twisted quietam then correct me if I'm wrong when they give you know the police
[2:28:54.480 --> 2:28:59.040]  a percentage of drug money seized or citizens get part of stuff from a
[2:28:59.040 --> 2:29:03.480]  criminal action but that's against citizens that's absolutely twisted that
[2:29:03.480 --> 2:29:09.640]  has been a good portion of what's turned this country into a police state but
[2:29:09.640 --> 2:29:13.080]  that's for a different show we are definitely in a police state and it's
[2:29:13.080 --> 2:29:17.120]  getting worse but we have opportunity here well I want to get back into all
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:20.520]  this but you were involved in a case here in Austin and we sent some cameras
[2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:27.000]  down this weekend dealing with a high powered Republican Tom DeLay and I
[2:29:27.000 --> 2:29:30.040]  want to hear about that due process issue because that's how you first got
[2:29:30.040 --> 2:29:34.160]  into studying the law then we'll get into the mortgages Randy but I'll go
[2:29:34.160 --> 2:29:38.280]  through this quickly well no we're going to break long segment coming up so
[2:29:38.280 --> 2:29:41.720]  we'll get into Tom DeLay and what's happening there and not the time delays
[2:29:41.720 --> 2:29:45.120]  a good guy but he's having his due process rights violated and they could
[2:29:45.120 --> 2:29:48.160]  violate his they could violate ours we'll talk about Randy involved with that
[2:29:48.160 --> 2:29:52.520]  case try to head them we'll get into the mortgages stay with us we're on the

[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:52.360]  going back to Randy Kelton I didn't mean to digress but it's important you
[2:35:52.360 --> 2:35:55.400]  called the office a few days ago and said this is pretty important I've heard
[2:35:55.400 --> 2:36:01.840]  you talk about the whole situation with Tom delay and I'm certainly no fan of
[2:36:01.840 --> 2:36:06.640]  some of the neo-connery he was involved in but it shows the power of state
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:10.680]  prosecutors grand juries they were really going after corruption but they
[2:36:10.680 --> 2:36:14.360]  didn't do that and you studied the case they didn't follow due process you've
[2:36:14.360 --> 2:36:19.640]  looked at the charges but he was removed from his leadership position and
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:23.360]  you were down there at the courthouse covering this just two days ago in
[2:36:23.360 --> 2:36:27.480]  Austin so briefly tell folks about that okay Tom delay was taken out of office
[2:36:27.480 --> 2:36:33.360]  by Ron Earl district attorney of Travis County Texas a local district attorney
[2:36:33.360 --> 2:36:39.120]  took out the speaker of the house and the way he did it is he went to a grand
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:44.240]  jury with an indictment and asked the grand jury to improve approve the
[2:36:44.240 --> 2:36:51.000]  indictment that is absolutely forbidden Kennedy v. State says in order to avoid
[2:36:51.000 --> 2:36:55.640]  the obvious evils of the accumulation of power in any one office for the
[2:36:55.640 --> 2:37:01.440]  purpose of filing a criminal complaint a prosecutor is not a credible person we
[2:37:01.440 --> 2:37:06.000]  fought a revolution to keep the government from being the accuser and
[2:37:06.000 --> 2:37:09.400]  the prosecutor you got three different branches of government and you and you
[2:37:09.400 --> 2:37:13.960]  can't have prosecutors has happened in the lead up to the war in 1776 becoming
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:19.160]  demi-gods prosecuting either political enemies you name it and that is exactly
[2:37:19.160 --> 2:37:24.760]  what happened here Ron Earl's problem is is he tried too hard and he created the
[2:37:24.760 --> 2:37:30.400]  avenue for his own downfall or the downfall of what he created he went to
[2:37:30.400 --> 2:37:35.560]  the grand jury and asked them to improve an indictment 27004 government code
[2:37:35.560 --> 2:37:41.700]  says that I'm sorry 27004 the Texas code of crime procedure duties of the
[2:37:41.700 --> 2:37:47.520]  grand jurors the grand jury shall examine into all criminal accusations that
[2:37:47.520 --> 2:37:50.680]  come to their knowledge by way of the prosecutor's attorney or any credible
[2:37:50.680 --> 2:37:58.040]  person problem a criminal accusation is a criminal complaint there is so he made
[2:37:58.040 --> 2:38:02.120]  the original complaint complaints are made by someone else then the
[2:38:02.120 --> 2:38:05.800]  prosecutor looks at it the prosecutor can't be the complaint and to end the
[2:38:05.800 --> 2:38:10.520]  deliverer exactly he's forbidden the only thing that gives the grand jury
[2:38:10.520 --> 2:38:16.480]  jurisdiction is a criminal affidavit filed by some credible and that's the
[2:38:16.480 --> 2:38:21.280]  heaviest corpus well this is a straight criminal complaint just like a ticket no
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:24.480]  no but if they can't show that I mean I mean where's the original complaint
[2:38:24.480 --> 2:38:29.000]  exactly this is what I said to Tom I put the writ in his hand I filed it two
[2:38:29.000 --> 2:38:34.160]  years ago in the court the judge refused to hear it and threw it out Tom
[2:38:34.160 --> 2:38:39.200]  delay's attorney Dick DeGaron called me and said did you follow it really have
[2:38:39.200 --> 2:38:42.760]  his corpus in this case yes I did I know Dick DeGaron I've interviewed him he
[2:38:42.760 --> 2:38:46.280]  said well I'm the attorney of record and I didn't authorize you to sign you
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:49.760]  filed that well I didn't need your authorization I have a right to do it
[2:38:49.760 --> 2:38:53.240]  besides you should have done it what were you doing when they were trousing
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:58.680]  all over all these rights you hung up on me really he I felt like I stepped in
[2:38:58.680 --> 2:39:04.960]  his milk but this was a special study that I had done because everybody's
[2:39:04.960 --> 2:39:09.600]  getting railroaded through the system I mentioned a police state earlier would
[2:39:09.600 --> 2:39:12.680]  you recognize a police state if you were in one let's see that's the power of a
[2:39:12.680 --> 2:39:17.600]  pro se litigant as you said once your lawyers in that bar they're not supposed
[2:39:17.600 --> 2:39:21.040]  to communicate with somebody else's client but you're a private citizen I'm
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:26.400]  probably citizen that's my right and the problem Ron Earl has in creating this
[2:39:26.400 --> 2:39:32.120]  prosecution against Tom delay illegally is after that when I filed a writ of
[2:39:32.120 --> 2:39:36.760]  habeas corpus for a kid in Montgomery County with the court of criminal
[2:39:36.760 --> 2:39:42.600]  appeals and they denied me permission to file well they didn't have authority to
[2:39:42.600 --> 2:39:46.660]  grant or deny permission it's a writ of right I filed criminal charges the
[2:39:46.660 --> 2:39:52.920]  grand jury well Ron Earl and his standard chicanery in an effort to get
[2:39:52.920 --> 2:39:57.440]  rid of all of these judges as they were all Republicans and he's a Democrat and
[2:39:57.440 --> 2:40:02.400]  he wasn't running again he actually gave my complaints against these judges to
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:08.320]  the grand jury all of the judges the 15 judges of the court of criminal appeals
[2:40:08.320 --> 2:40:14.360]  I almost got him about two years ago but he opened the door well briefly where
[2:40:14.360 --> 2:40:18.160]  before we get back into the mortgages where is this what's the process right
[2:40:18.160 --> 2:40:25.080]  now with this individual well I filed a writ and the judge told me I stood up
[2:40:25.080 --> 2:40:29.000]  in court and stopped the court telling them that I have business with this
[2:40:29.000 --> 2:40:33.280]  court and it supersedes any business currently before the court and judge
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:37.840]  Dietz district judge Dietz said oh you're the guy with their rid of habeas
[2:40:37.840 --> 2:40:41.480]  corpus I'm not gonna waste all these good people's time with that nonsense you
[2:40:41.480 --> 2:40:45.400]  are not to say another word get out of my courtroom I looked around for the
[2:40:45.400 --> 2:40:49.480]  bailiff and I couldn't find him I had made the mistake earlier of telling him
[2:40:49.480 --> 2:40:53.320]  that if this judge refused to hear the the writ I was gonna ask the bailiff to
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:59.320]  arrest the judge well the bailiff chickened out and hit the road so I left
[2:40:59.320 --> 2:41:04.040]  the courtroom and now I will be filing against judge Dietz with the grand jury
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:08.560]  and we'll see if he's as arrogant when I get him in front of a grand jury as he
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:12.240]  was in that courtroom but but specifically where is Tom DeLay in the
[2:41:12.240 --> 2:41:18.600]  process right now now I I put this writ in Tom DeLay's hand now he knows that
[2:41:18.600 --> 2:41:25.560]  this local prosecuting attorney took him out of office absolutely illegally I
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:30.840]  suspect Tom DeLay is really unhappy right now now I'll say this on the air I
[2:41:30.840 --> 2:41:39.360]  have no compassion or love for Tom DeLay he's a politician the purpose was his
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:43.280]  due process what rights were being violated like everyone else's if he
[2:41:43.280 --> 2:41:49.160]  realizes how dangerous this corrupt situation is the problem all these
[2:41:49.160 --> 2:41:54.600]  corrupt politicians have is they can't protect themselves from one another it
[2:41:54.600 --> 2:42:00.240]  when if he goes to the Republican Party and they realize how vulnerable every
[2:42:00.240 --> 2:42:05.880]  one of them are we could well get them to come down and put pressure to stop
[2:42:05.880 --> 2:42:11.520]  this practice in which case they'll open the door for you and I to go down with
[2:42:11.520 --> 2:42:14.920]  criminal complaints against public officials get them in front of grand
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:20.160]  juries and that will change everything and of course grand juries you have the
[2:42:20.160 --> 2:42:23.840]  ballot box you have the jury box the grand jury box you go back 50 years
[2:42:23.840 --> 2:42:27.040]  ago grand juries were pretty much independent and very powerful and
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:30.680]  represented the people now they've been turned into creatures of the
[2:42:30.680 --> 2:42:34.360]  prosecutors but just because they operate like they own them doesn't mean
[2:42:34.360 --> 2:42:38.040]  that that's legal or legitimate but my question is where is Tom DeLay in his
[2:42:38.040 --> 2:42:43.720]  cases right now he hasn't contacted me since I gave him the documentation of
[2:42:43.720 --> 2:42:48.240]  it where is his case his case they're in jury selection right now and they're
[2:42:48.240 --> 2:42:53.480]  trying to prosecute him for a felony so they he didn't take a deal and you've
[2:42:53.480 --> 2:42:58.320]  looked at the case here's he was not guilty of it rather he's guilty or not
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:02.680]  I'm not sure but from reading the case there's nothing in the case that would
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:06.840]  indicate and what are they claiming he did oh they're claiming he took money
[2:43:06.840 --> 2:43:12.680]  under the table and then took that money and invested it in different ventures
[2:43:12.680 --> 2:43:18.360]  of his own but they from what I could see it was if he at best the fact that
[2:43:18.360 --> 2:43:23.360]  Tom DeLay is willing to take this to court he's pretty sure he's gonna win
[2:43:23.360 --> 2:43:29.000]  it but I suspect now with the problems that the prosecutors gonna have
[2:43:29.000 --> 2:43:34.960]  maintaining due process he's got a much bigger chance of winning it but why
[2:43:34.960 --> 2:43:38.560]  isn't Tom DeLay bringing up the issue that the complaint was brought by a
[2:43:38.560 --> 2:43:45.560]  political opponent most likely his attorney has fed him a story but I
[2:43:45.560 --> 2:43:49.240]  can't speculate I want I mean I've had to get on a few times he defended the
[2:43:49.240 --> 2:43:55.600]  Waco folks he's pretty good guy but he lost that's because the same because the
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:43:59.680]  judge that ran the Waco operation was over the court I mean the judge that
[2:43:59.680 --> 2:44:03.880]  was over the criminal trial was over the civil I didn't understand I had heard
[2:44:03.880 --> 2:44:08.360]  good about Dick DeGeron I didn't understand why he didn't look at this
[2:44:08.360 --> 2:44:15.280]  and say this is an absolute open door to get this thrown out unless he had a
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:21.080]  strategy I didn't know about which was bring this up at trial and force a
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:24.520]  dismissal at trial that way they can't come back after and that might be why
[2:44:24.520 --> 2:44:30.480]  he's mad at you for disclosing a secret weapon he could have told me well he
[2:44:30.480 --> 2:44:34.920]  doesn't he doesn't know you're out there Randy I really didn't care about his
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:37.760]  position I understand you're just pointing out the due process and how
[2:44:37.760 --> 2:44:40.840]  they're violating that I'm concerned about what they're doing to you and me
[2:44:40.840 --> 2:44:50.840]  and everybody in the United's in Texas average conviction rate 99.6 would you
[2:44:50.840 --> 2:44:55.000]  recognize a police state if you were in one the United States houses
[2:44:55.000 --> 2:45:01.960]  approximately 3% of the world's population it houses approximately 50% of
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:06.600]  the world's population of inmates would you recognize a police state if you were
[2:45:06.600 --> 2:45:12.160]  in one this is the worst police state the world has ever seen and we don't have
[2:45:12.160 --> 2:45:19.480]  a clue that's why I'm going after this well it is crazy how they how they
[2:45:19.480 --> 2:45:23.400]  selectively prosecute innocent people and leave corrupt people alone have you
[2:45:23.400 --> 2:45:28.020]  heard about this Jack Conway case where his brother is a prosecutor he's the
[2:45:28.020 --> 2:45:31.880]  Attorney General of Kentucky running against Rand Paul and they were gonna
[2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:35.400]  swat team his brother for reported narcotics trafficking and usage that was
[2:45:35.400 --> 2:45:40.120]  the alleged thing and then the the the the the the head narcotics officer
[2:45:40.120 --> 2:45:43.840]  warned his brother and then warned Conway and then his brother and the
[2:45:43.840 --> 2:45:47.600]  detectives lied to other investigators and now they admit all this in the
[2:45:47.600 --> 2:45:51.280]  newspaper but it's not a big issue that sounds like obstruction of justice this
[2:45:51.280 --> 2:45:56.520]  is this is something that citizens need to go down to grand juries with criminal
[2:45:56.520 --> 2:46:01.360]  charges against these guys the nice thing about criminal charges you're
[2:46:01.360 --> 2:46:06.360]  absolutely protected if you file criminal charges anyone who interferes
[2:46:06.360 --> 2:46:10.960]  with you they wind up with criminal charges against them we don't have in
[2:46:10.960 --> 2:46:16.600]  time on this show but I have a whole process for going after one person and
[2:46:16.600 --> 2:46:19.880]  when someone steps in the way and tries to protect them you forget the first
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:23.720]  one go for the second one and eventually you want to go for a district
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:27.760]  judge and drag the district judge down to the grand jury and when you get the
[2:46:27.760 --> 2:46:31.240]  district judge to the grand jury for protecting the district attorney from
[2:46:31.240 --> 2:46:35.880]  prosecution the district judge is going to be really unhappy with the district
[2:46:35.880 --> 2:46:39.560]  but how can they be in the newspaper admitting they lied and admitting they
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.520]  warned him and then they're not instantly indicted they're not afraid of us
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:48.120]  Thomas Jefferson said when the people fear the government there is tyranny
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:52.360]  when the government fears the people there is liberty the government does not
[2:46:52.360 --> 2:46:54.960]  yet fear the people that's like these mortgages and now we'll start getting
[2:46:54.960 --> 2:46:59.680]  into that I mean with these mortgages they're just out in the open Randy like
[2:46:59.680 --> 2:47:03.720]  that lawyer said just engaged in total fraud and they know it yes that they
[2:47:03.720 --> 2:47:07.400]  bought the but they bought the courts and what I tell people when I present
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:12.800]  this courts are absolutely corrupt you fire you sue in the court you sue
[2:47:12.800 --> 2:47:18.440]  pro se they're gonna rule against you at every turn you have to expect that they
[2:47:18.440 --> 2:47:22.120]  are so corrupt but but but why are people having victory though even though
[2:47:22.120 --> 2:47:25.560]  that's happening you're forcing them to fight it and they've got so many things
[2:47:25.560 --> 2:47:28.480]  they're stealing they don't have time to deal with it but then if you go back at
[2:47:28.480 --> 2:47:31.840]  them and sue them but I mean look at these cases here Randy it's all over the
[2:47:31.840 --> 2:47:35.000]  Wall Street Journal they're winning these cases against the facts here's the
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:40.000]  problem with the guys who bought the judges the judges are so corrupt they
[2:47:40.000 --> 2:47:45.460]  can't even trust politics there's two kinds of power three kinds of power
[2:47:45.460 --> 2:47:54.160]  politics money and votes and guns and guns right now vote is votes are becoming
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:48:00.080]  the big issue for the politicians the politicians are exerting influence on
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:05.560]  the courts and the courts are betraying the ones that bought them so and they're
[2:48:05.560 --> 2:48:10.480]  setting a precedent for down the road once this election is over you know
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:13.880]  they remember the House of Representatives is up for election they're
[2:48:13.880 --> 2:48:18.560]  going in with 11% approval rating they can hear the toilet flushing they're
[2:48:18.560 --> 2:48:25.040]  doing everything they can to distract the public from them and get them looking
[2:48:25.040 --> 2:48:31.200]  at some other enemy while the politicians who created this mess put on a
[2:48:31.200 --> 2:48:35.240]  show of trying to do something to clean it up just long enough for us to vote
[2:48:35.240 --> 2:48:40.840]  for them so they can go back to business as usual the problem is once they open
[2:48:40.840 --> 2:48:45.320]  this legal door they set the precedent they get this train on the track and they
[2:48:45.320 --> 2:48:49.440]  can't get it off the precedent for banks to take anybody's property they want is
[2:48:49.440 --> 2:48:53.280]  one precedent or the precedent that people started to win and now people
[2:48:53.280 --> 2:48:59.480]  understand it's a fraud yes and the I read some figures on the judges
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:06.760]  retirement funds are also invested in these consumer mortgages they the funds
[2:49:06.760 --> 2:49:12.200]  values have went from 6.8 billion to 2.3 billion in the last four years so the
[2:49:12.200 --> 2:49:15.720]  judges have been robbed so now the judges are realizing that they screwed
[2:49:15.720 --> 2:49:21.560]  themselves and now they need to do something to find a way to recover and
[2:49:21.560 --> 2:49:26.960]  we have a number of unions and other retirement investment funds that are
[2:49:26.960 --> 2:49:31.120]  suing the lenders to try to recover some of these these monies that they've
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:35.040]  lost okay we've given some of the basics in the next few segments I want you to
[2:49:35.040 --> 2:49:39.640]  go through your document cam presentation but we're about to go to break

[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:03.280]  people the fraud first they've got to see the fraud then you'll talk about the
[2:50:03.280 --> 2:50:08.160]  remedies that have been having the most success yes the Glass-Steagall Act was
[2:50:08.160 --> 2:50:15.640]  the was the start the in the 80s and 90s the Bush and then first Clinton and then
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:21.120]  Bush removed the Glass-Steagall Act and another act that protected borrowers from
[2:50:21.120 --> 2:50:26.160]  the lenders well under the guise of making housing available to poor they
[2:50:26.160 --> 2:50:29.640]  took these protections off and about the same time they started
[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:35.280]  securitizing notes well this created an opportunity for people to go into
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:38.600]  business as mortgage companies and they didn't care about the mortgage they
[2:50:38.600 --> 2:50:43.520]  create the mortgage and sell it to get their money take profit walk away so it
[2:50:43.520 --> 2:50:49.360]  made it profitable to sell these two investors and the more expensive the loan
[2:50:49.360 --> 2:50:53.680]  product the more profit they made all right we're gonna explain all this and
[2:50:53.680 --> 2:50:57.960]  then get into all the facts figures and numbers folks the mortgages are nothing
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:51:01.000]  that's just the beginning the root of the fraud we're gonna look at this whole

[2:54:11.800 --> 2:54:15.880]  of the larger banking takeover Randy's a pro se litigant having a lot of big
[2:54:15.880 --> 2:54:19.440]  success keeping people in their houses teaching them how to defend themselves
[2:54:19.440 --> 2:54:22.720]  that's the secret because you heard the law firm earlier they got more business
[2:54:22.720 --> 2:54:26.080]  they can even take and there's other law firms learning other individuals
[2:54:26.080 --> 2:54:30.280]  learning you know how to demand a process how to not just be rolled over and
[2:54:30.280 --> 2:54:34.280]  by everybody resisting or even a small percentage resisting that's already
[2:54:34.280 --> 2:54:38.320]  brought them to a grinding halt Randy on the document cam for prison planet TV
[2:54:38.320 --> 2:54:41.520]  viewers we're going to be going over these charts and graphs we got a free
[2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:44.920]  video link it's what everybody gets every day of their prison planet TV
[2:54:44.920 --> 2:54:48.600]  member adds a whole new dimension to the show what's this first graph we've got
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:53.800]  here this first graph is a graph of housing prices for the last hundred
[2:54:53.800 --> 2:55:00.240]  years and you can see there was a rather large drop around the end of the
[2:55:00.240 --> 2:55:06.120]  cent turn of the century the last two peaks there was a peak in the 20s a
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:13.720]  peak in the 40s then it dropped down and in the year 2000 the graph went almost
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:19.680]  straight up and there's a reason for that we can go back and it's hard to see
[2:55:19.680 --> 2:55:25.000]  on the graph but in there's a drop down in 1907 and that drop down was caused
[2:55:25.000 --> 2:55:30.760]  because people were allowed to bet on stocks whether they would increase or
[2:55:30.760 --> 2:55:35.480]  decrease without actually purchasing the stock that was called derivatives it
[2:55:35.480 --> 2:55:40.000]  caused the stock market crash in 1907 so the legislature forbade it that's right
[2:55:40.000 --> 2:55:49.520]  here they forbade the practice made it a felony until the year 2000 the year 2000
[2:55:49.520 --> 2:55:55.200]  they removed that restriction so with the Glass-Steagall Act gone and government
[2:55:55.200 --> 2:56:00.600]  oversight of the lenders is non-existent they essentially unleashed the money
[2:56:00.600 --> 2:56:04.760]  changers on us convincing everybody to do the one thing that had always been
[2:56:04.760 --> 2:56:09.160]  forbidden and to speculate on their home and to take their good stable loans in
[2:56:09.160 --> 2:56:13.720]  which they were building equity and trade them in for speculative loans that
[2:56:13.720 --> 2:56:20.080]  they would possibly make a lot of money on but in the end something else could
[2:56:20.080 --> 2:56:24.160]  happen which they didn't tell them about and the easiest way to visualize is turn
[2:56:24.160 --> 2:56:29.960]  that graph upside down because that's what has actually happened to the to
[2:56:29.960 --> 2:56:41.160]  the lending industry are you a graph of property sales which reflects property
[2:56:41.160 --> 2:56:47.080]  prices we'll get prices in a second but since 2008 is where the graph starts
[2:56:47.080 --> 2:56:53.280]  down or that was 2007 it starts down this one ends at 2008 and it's done
[2:56:53.280 --> 2:57:00.000]  nothing but get worse sense let's go to the one in the back this one this is an
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:07.560]  indication this is a graph of percent home owners with mortgage negative
[2:57:07.560 --> 2:57:14.440]  equity by state the very first state there is Nevada from Nevada we go to
[2:57:14.440 --> 2:57:20.640]  Arizona Florida Michigan California Michigan if you go to Detroit it looks
[2:57:20.640 --> 2:57:27.920]  like a war zone we've been there it looks like I mean I can't even describe it
[2:57:27.920 --> 2:57:31.680]  it looks like one of those movies where everybody's dead on the planet kind of
[2:57:31.680 --> 2:57:35.520]  like I am legend or something and there's just nobody there nobody there this is
[2:57:35.520 --> 2:57:39.600]  going to happen even more what's happening right now is the banks are
[2:57:39.600 --> 2:57:44.840]  foreclosing on so many owns they can't sell them they have to take them back
[2:57:44.840 --> 2:57:49.840]  they can't sell them into the market because it'll drive the prices of housing
[2:57:49.840 --> 2:57:54.320]  down so much that the housing industry will collapse completely they already
[2:57:54.320 --> 2:57:59.760]  have every state with a good number of people upside down on their mortgages if
[2:57:59.760 --> 2:58:05.800]  they repossess these houses and then put them back out there for sale this graph
[2:58:05.800 --> 2:58:11.400]  will increase exponentially what we're looking at is a major housing shortage
[2:58:11.400 --> 2:58:17.920]  very soon while then nobody's building houses now all construction is ceased the
[2:58:17.920 --> 2:58:22.240]  only construction that's going on is what's already been funded can't afford
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:25.520]  to build houses now I have a number of friends construction industry it's
[2:58:25.520 --> 2:58:32.000]  completely shut down by over 90% likely to start destroying these houses because
[2:58:32.000 --> 2:58:35.680]  came forward to keep them we're gonna come right back in one minute with the
[2:58:35.680 --> 2:58:53.200]  fourth hour live stay with us ladies and gentlemen this is Alex Jones with five
[2:58:53.200 --> 2:58:57.440]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[2:58:57.440 --> 2:59:01.240]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[2:59:01.240 --> 2:59:05.320]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[2:59:05.320 --> 2:59:09.520]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[2:59:09.520 --> 2:59:13.840]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[2:59:13.840 --> 2:59:17.800]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[2:59:17.800 --> 2:59:22.160]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[2:59:22.160 --> 2:59:25.920]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:59:25.920 --> 2:59:30.040]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:59:30.040 --> 2:59:33.840]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[2:59:33.840 --> 2:59:37.320]  powered generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors
[2:59:37.320 --> 2:59:42.520]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar

[2:59:52.120 --> 2:59:58.120]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:59:58.120 --> 3:00:12.240]  Broadcasting Network. One of the other stories up at infowars.com has been
[3:00:12.240 --> 3:00:18.000]  broken by the drugs reports today. George Bush's new book he admits he gave the
[3:00:18.000 --> 3:00:21.760]  order to basically shoot down flight 93 which is what all the witnesses said
[3:00:21.760 --> 3:00:25.920]  they'd seen but he claims then it just crashed on its own side issue but that's
[3:00:25.920 --> 3:00:30.840]  the type of important stuff up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com
[3:00:30.840 --> 3:00:35.280]  Randy Kelton you know really a mortgage fraud analyst somebody that breaks this
[3:00:35.280 --> 3:00:38.840]  down and then kind of collates the different systems that are working
[3:00:38.840 --> 3:00:42.600]  against it joins us and I and I thought I should plug one of your websites it's
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:46.280]  just a basic contact point for folks that want more information and it's
[3:00:46.280 --> 3:00:52.560]  mortgagecrimes.com yes and just a quick comment on flight 93 the guy called
[3:00:52.560 --> 3:00:56.840]  with a cell phone from the airplane I tried to call a friend of mine from the
[3:00:56.840 --> 3:01:02.400]  top of the Empire State Building I couldn't get a signal when I went to the
[3:01:02.400 --> 3:01:05.440]  bottom of the Empire State Building I could give no cell phones don't work
[3:01:05.440 --> 3:01:09.840]  over about 2,000 feet and of course they claim they worked at 35,000 feet that day
[3:01:09.840 --> 3:01:14.120]  yes that was absolute nonsense and then it turned out it was yeah okay so what's
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:19.760]  this new graph we've got here this is a graph of the number of foreclosures by
[3:01:19.760 --> 3:01:24.140]  month right at the end you see it appears to go down and they've been
[3:01:24.140 --> 3:01:27.240]  talking about oh it's getting better there are less foreclosures that's
[3:01:27.240 --> 3:01:33.320]  because this modification scam they instituted this modification we'll
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:37.480]  modify your loan for you so it takes two or three months to get through the
[3:01:37.480 --> 3:01:43.160]  modification issue that's why it looks like it's down well people are finding
[3:01:43.160 --> 3:01:47.400]  out that the modification is a setup you ask for a modification they say oh sure
[3:01:47.400 --> 3:01:51.680]  but we can't modify unless you're a couple of payments behind and then when
[3:01:51.680 --> 3:01:55.880]  you get a couple payments behind and start negotiating the modifications you
[3:01:55.880 --> 3:01:59.120]  notice they accelerate your note and you ask them what is this oh don't worry
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:02.880]  about that the modification take care of it then you get a notice of foreclosure
[3:02:02.880 --> 3:02:08.000]  oh that take care of that the last thing they'll do is deny your modification
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:12.960]  and foreclose immediately or if they do give you a modification it's supposed to
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:16.000]  lower your payments for a period of time and then come back up to where they
[3:02:16.000 --> 3:02:19.840]  were it lowers your payments for a period of time and then they triple miss
[3:02:19.840 --> 3:02:24.880]  one payment after modification they foreclose instantly it's all a setup to
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:28.560]  force you into a foreclosure it's a way to get you to waive your rights yeah the
[3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:34.040]  only way the lender makes the big money is to foreclose he don't care about your
[3:02:34.040 --> 3:02:39.760]  property derivatives he'll make eight to ten times the amount of your principal
[3:02:39.760 --> 3:02:45.400]  if he forecloses all he wants to do is foreclose after that you be everything
[3:02:45.400 --> 3:02:50.280]  in this becomes a liability to him and that's where we have an advantage that's
[3:02:50.280 --> 3:02:55.240]  where we can take him to task and do something to stop all of this the
[3:02:55.240 --> 3:03:00.320]  courts are turning against him because the politicians are in trouble all of
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:05.040]  this is working in our to our benefit if we're gonna chase if we don't do
[3:03:05.040 --> 3:03:11.240]  something quickly this country will be forced into by far the worst depression
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:17.000]  it's ever seen because all of these sales of the security instrument with no
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:23.960]  hard trace of where they've been creates property nobody can invest in when we
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:28.040]  can't get foreign investment there's no way for us to come back out of this
[3:03:28.040 --> 3:03:34.400]  depression we're going into so we need to stop as many foreclosures as possible
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:40.000]  everybody here needs to stay in their houses and the best way to do that's
[3:03:40.000 --> 3:03:45.600]  to sue them these the attorneys that were on before when lose a draw you sue them
[3:03:45.600 --> 3:03:52.160]  you win they're gonna lose even if they win the house in the end which is
[3:03:52.160 --> 3:03:55.960]  becoming very unlikely no no they're losing them they're
[3:03:55.960 --> 3:03:59.600]  they're failing because once they get into depositions they go yeah we don't
[3:03:59.600 --> 3:04:03.280]  have the data we didn't review the documents or we charge too many fees or
[3:04:03.280 --> 3:04:07.960]  yeah we sold this over and over again I mean and then they're dead yes we put
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:14.160]  together a program to help people get in the court just sue them the first one I
[3:04:14.160 --> 3:04:17.240]  did someone came to me you got to do something I'm gonna be thrown out in
[3:04:17.240 --> 3:04:22.800]  three days I went on the internet I used my most own skill played your eyes I
[3:04:22.800 --> 3:04:26.320]  pulled down a bunch of suits with issues that match this guy's issues that was
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:30.280]  what two and a half years ago last November I've heard you for years
[3:04:30.280 --> 3:04:33.280]  talking about it I've been I've been researching it and they found out I was
[3:04:33.280 --> 3:04:36.960]  researching it and they actually got me doing this before I was ready so we're
[3:04:36.960 --> 3:04:41.400]  finally getting all our pieces in place right now but this guy I just put
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:46.800]  together a suit and frankly it was junk he's still in his house he filed this
[3:04:46.800 --> 3:04:51.440]  junk suit and just two months ago the lender came to him and said well you
[3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:55.360]  sued the wrong person you should see this guy folks can contact you at mortgage

[3:07:59.760 --> 3:08:06.520]  today the Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones
[3:08:06.520 --> 3:08:11.400]  show because there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:11.400 --> 3:08:20.520]  you have a question for Randy Kelton starting in the next segment we're
[3:08:20.520 --> 3:08:27.080]  gonna go to your calls 1-800-259-9231 now just a few months ago it was a
[3:08:27.080 --> 3:08:32.400]  fraud it was a conspiracy theory to say make them show you the note go after
[3:08:32.400 --> 3:08:37.360]  them for selling the note for not having a proper chain of title for selling it
[3:08:37.360 --> 3:08:41.320]  into derivatives clouding your title because you're supposedly paying in
[3:08:41.320 --> 3:08:45.240]  to finally own this house and they've already sold it down the road all these
[3:08:45.240 --> 3:08:49.200]  foreign countries and corporations see this affects everybody not just people
[3:08:49.200 --> 3:08:52.520]  that are upside down that's why they're taking houses that are paid for or they
[3:08:52.520 --> 3:08:58.320]  don't even have a note for because this was sold in derivatives just because
[3:08:58.320 --> 3:09:02.440]  lawyers and and proceeds finally sued and busted all this open they ceased
[3:09:02.440 --> 3:09:05.720]  many of the foreclosures because it's killing them and they're looking for a
[3:09:05.720 --> 3:09:10.120]  political remedy in Congress to tell them they're allowed to do all this but
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:13.880]  then if Congress does do that as they're signaling they are then there's no
[3:09:13.880 --> 3:09:17.200]  private property left in this country I mean Randy that's why I've been spending
[3:09:17.200 --> 3:09:23.040]  so much time on this this is a big deal this is the deal there's a good chance
[3:09:23.040 --> 3:09:29.920]  this country will come apart over all of this and in terms of remedies I may be
[3:09:29.920 --> 3:09:35.280]  suggesting something that would lead to that if we're gonna fix this this problem
[3:09:35.280 --> 3:09:39.040]  one of the things we do I hate new legislation but there is a little bit
[3:09:39.040 --> 3:09:45.360]  that we need well one of the things we need is statutes forbidding the paying
[3:09:45.360 --> 3:09:51.600]  of derivatives we can't go back and undo what's been done but we had that before
[3:09:51.600 --> 3:09:58.120]  99 yes before 99 it was a felony to do that we should stop the payment of all
[3:09:58.120 --> 3:10:02.600]  derivatives that these people have bought this is insurance that's what
[3:10:02.600 --> 3:10:06.160]  Webster Tarpley says freeze them they're they're fraud they were induced through
[3:10:06.160 --> 3:10:10.600]  fraud it's over yeah right and they have this leaves the lender without this
[3:10:10.600 --> 3:10:13.800]  monetary and then they try to hold this hostage and say we're going into a
[3:10:13.800 --> 3:10:16.600]  depression if we don't do that we're already in one yeah we're gonna go into
[3:10:16.600 --> 3:10:20.840]  one worse if we continue this and the other thing the state of Georgia has
[3:10:20.840 --> 3:10:28.440]  before its house legislation that would declare gold and silver as the legal
[3:10:28.440 --> 3:10:32.800]  tender valued by weight of species they're looking at pulling out of the
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:36.560]  dollar that's the best thing the states could do to stabilize their economies
[3:10:36.560 --> 3:10:42.760]  economically and one other thing a program that was talked about a few
[3:10:42.760 --> 3:10:47.560]  months ago and then just kind of disappeared to force occupancy for
[3:10:47.560 --> 3:10:52.360]  repossessed properties to allow the people to stay in the properties until
[3:10:52.360 --> 3:10:57.520]  either litigation was finished or until the bank because that doesn't drive down
[3:10:57.520 --> 3:11:02.360]  property values now somebody's mowing the yard homeless don't move in the
[3:11:02.360 --> 3:11:05.520]  banks now that's the best policy but they need to go ahead and get it fully
[3:11:05.520 --> 3:11:09.080]  under their control to keep it pegged to their derivatives and that everybody
[3:11:09.080 --> 3:11:12.880]  would win in that case even the banks would win they wouldn't have all these
[3:11:12.880 --> 3:11:17.720]  houses that are empty they can't ensure and if they don't keep them up they
[3:11:17.720 --> 3:11:22.080]  become a public nuisance then they can get cited by this is the cities in the
[3:11:22.080 --> 3:11:26.800]  states in California if you don't maintain an empty property it's a felony
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:31.440]  because it creates such a dangerous situation it's a problem for the banks
[3:11:31.440 --> 3:11:34.640]  I'm afraid the banks are gonna start bulldozing these houses that's already
[3:11:34.640 --> 3:11:39.440]  happening in Detroit it's and it's this is what's happened in Detroit what's
[3:11:39.440 --> 3:11:43.320]  happening in Nevada that's just a person I remember a year and a half ago they
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:46.520]  had LA Times articles about people riding through ghost town you know
[3:11:46.520 --> 3:11:51.080]  million-dollar home neighborhoods with with mountain lions on the roofs and
[3:11:51.080 --> 3:11:56.320]  bobcats and wolves and turkeys running around I mean it's just it's a wild
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:02.400]  kingdom and this country is going to go to that I hate to think of Mad Max's
[3:12:02.400 --> 3:12:07.560]  programs as having any truth to them but we're looking at some really serious
[3:12:07.560 --> 3:12:11.040]  problems okay let's let's get into the rest your your literature in these
[3:12:11.040 --> 3:12:15.600]  graphs and charts you've got here Randy and and and some of the different again
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:18.760]  you can't diagnose something over the phone or even on the radio just basic
[3:12:18.760 --> 3:12:22.120]  stuff you know is working because this is a work in progress some of the things
[3:12:22.120 --> 3:12:25.200]  other lawyers are doing things you've been doing some of the way some of the
[3:12:25.200 --> 3:12:30.720]  best suits out there best thing to do first thing to do is look at the amount
[3:12:30.720 --> 3:12:35.280]  of fraud the courts are saying to the lawyers don't keep coming to me with
[3:12:35.280 --> 3:12:39.960]  these generic general accusations of where is the note and you don't have
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:45.000]  standing or agency or capacity give me something particular with this note that
[3:12:45.000 --> 3:12:48.440]  shows that this particular notes a problem so first thing you do is look
[3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:52.720]  at your HUD ones how you at your truth and lending statement in your note
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:59.440]  almost everyone will have a principal in interest on the note that's different
[3:12:59.440 --> 3:13:03.480]  than the principal in interest on the truth and lending statement you should
[3:13:03.480 --> 3:13:09.400]  run a amortization on both of them what you find may surprise you one of the
[3:13:09.400 --> 3:13:13.800]  first ones I did had a hundred and fifteen thousand dollar note at six
[3:13:13.800 --> 3:13:18.160]  point five percent that came up with a six hundred ninety three dollar payment
[3:13:18.160 --> 3:13:22.840]  the truth in lending which contained the amounts that the person actually was
[3:13:22.840 --> 3:13:28.280]  required to pay had six point five percent interest at a hundred and
[3:13:28.280 --> 3:13:33.400]  thirteen nine almost a thousand little over a thousand dollars less principal
[3:13:33.400 --> 3:13:37.000]  half or percent more in interest well after you said it closing and read a
[3:13:37.000 --> 3:13:40.960]  stack of documents an inch high your brain kind of turns to mud and asked
[3:13:40.960 --> 3:13:45.360]  Steve about that and he said I noticed it but it looked like it balanced out when
[3:13:45.360 --> 3:13:49.960]  I ran the notes together the difference that you would act you would the amount
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:54.160]  you would overpay if you paid what was on the truth and lending statement on a
[3:13:54.160 --> 3:13:58.320]  hundred and fifteen thousand dollar note in thirty years he would have overpaid
[3:13:58.320 --> 3:14:06.080]  forty four thousand dollars so we run the calculation take that as a fraud
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:10.080]  claim because in fraud you don't claim the amount you were actually defrauded
[3:14:10.080 --> 3:14:14.200]  of it was a five-year-old your note you claim the amount you would have been
[3:14:14.200 --> 3:14:18.920]  defrauded of had their plan ran to fruition forty four thousand but you
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:24.600]  don't sue for that either you sue for triple first calculation we get an
[3:14:24.600 --> 3:14:30.680]  amount in fraud claim greater than the amount of the original principal then
[3:14:30.680 --> 3:14:35.640]  look at your hood one settlement statement sell these fees on there the
[3:14:35.640 --> 3:14:41.360]  lender is only allowed to charge the borrower those fees the borrower would
[3:14:41.360 --> 3:14:47.680]  have to pay if they purchased the house in cash and those fees the lender must
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:53.440]  pay to a third-party vendor but at closing he didn't provide you with any
[3:14:53.440 --> 3:14:59.160]  documentation to show first that the fees were proper allowed by law that the
[3:14:59.160 --> 3:15:04.400]  services provided by the lend by the vendor what were necessary that the
[3:15:04.400 --> 3:15:09.880]  amounts charged were reasonable neither did he show you his disbursement to show
[3:15:09.880 --> 3:15:14.760]  that he didn't take an unauthorized markup on the amounts charged so we
[3:15:14.760 --> 3:15:19.160]  claim they're all bogus they're all false what about when they also have you
[3:15:19.160 --> 3:15:22.400]  signed papers saying you know this is going to be packaged and resold they
[3:15:22.400 --> 3:15:25.760]  don't tell you this means this could cloud your title down the road what they
[3:15:25.760 --> 3:15:32.280]  don't tell you isn't for the most part it was it's already sold you think the
[3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:36.480]  guy who's standing in front of you as the lender is the guy who lent you the
[3:15:36.480 --> 3:15:41.040]  money he's not especially purpose vehicles the one lending you the money
[3:15:41.040 --> 3:15:44.640]  it's already been sold to him that's why the loans already been authorized yeah
[3:15:44.640 --> 3:15:49.600]  and he's not licensed to do business in the state he's not a licensed lender the
[3:15:49.600 --> 3:15:54.400]  lenders lending him his license and it the whole process is illegal but going
[3:15:54.400 --> 3:15:57.680]  back I mean they're winning in court and you're having success as well I mean
[3:15:57.680 --> 3:16:02.080]  going after the fact of show us the deed or show us who who who signed off on
[3:16:02.080 --> 3:16:06.480]  this foreclosure statement who you know who had notaries sign it and they
[3:16:06.480 --> 3:16:09.640]  didn't I mean that's working but you're saying you're doing that and then
[3:16:09.640 --> 3:16:14.360]  adding other things on it yeah we come in with a very large fraud claim against
[3:16:14.360 --> 3:16:21.280]  the lender it's a large number frankly we'd never win that number but in the
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:27.640]  end we don't care because the other side knows as well as we do when we get in
[3:16:27.640 --> 3:16:31.640]  front of the the jury and tell the jury to kind of crap all of these guys have
[3:16:31.640 --> 3:16:36.120]  pulled on them the first thing the jury is going to do when they go home that
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:38.600]  night's pull out their hood one settlement statement and they're going to
[3:16:38.600 --> 3:16:47.000]  see a fee on there that says document preparation fee assumption fee all of
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:49.600]  these different fees and they're gonna know they've been in the same boat just
[3:16:49.600 --> 3:16:52.680]  like the judges who were invested in these funds and have lost two-thirds of
[3:16:52.680 --> 3:16:56.040]  their money in the last two years and and so what you talked about a few weeks
[3:16:56.040 --> 3:17:00.160]  ago is once this is done they're immediately rushing to the table wanting
[3:17:00.160 --> 3:17:05.600]  to make a deal that's the whole idea is the courts are corrupt guys they're
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:09.200]  absolutely corrupt you don't want to get in front of the court the other side
[3:17:09.200 --> 3:17:12.880]  doesn't want to get on in front of the court nobody can trust them either side
[3:17:12.880 --> 3:17:18.880]  we build as strong a case against the lender as we can and this number we
[3:17:18.880 --> 3:17:25.360]  bring to the table the jury no matter what they the other side does to that
[3:17:25.360 --> 3:17:29.120]  number there's only one number they're gonna remember and that's the one you
[3:17:29.120 --> 3:17:33.000]  walked in the door with now it's a good number we can take you how we got that
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:39.960]  number to the penny so we have a direct claim on this loan of an exact amount of
[3:17:39.960 --> 3:17:45.200]  fraud and generally $300,000 note we can find between a million and a million true
[3:17:45.200 --> 3:17:51.480]  in fraud claim against the lender then we go into all of the issues that they
[3:17:51.480 --> 3:17:57.240]  absolutely cannot defend so so that's the bona fide claim is the fraud and then
[3:17:57.240 --> 3:18:03.480]  you open it up to okay now now we're in a suit give us your deed so that's how
[3:18:03.480 --> 3:18:08.000]  you get it into court then you say now show us the deed okay show us you know
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:11.840]  that that oh you saw like the lawyer said two hours ago oh you signed all
[3:18:11.840 --> 3:18:15.880]  these papers and it's just some lawyer they're doing the service you claim
[3:18:15.880 --> 3:18:19.360]  that you'd you'd reviewed everything you just perjured yourself exactly an
[3:18:19.360 --> 3:18:24.760]  attorney may not accept the word of his client he must test the veracity of his
[3:18:24.760 --> 3:18:29.320]  client himself and the guy and first thing we want to talk to is the guy
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:34.280]  who's doing the foreclosure who are you I want to see your contract with the
[3:18:34.280 --> 3:18:38.720]  principal you're the agent agency may not be proven out of the mouth of the
[3:18:38.720 --> 3:18:43.520]  agent it must be proven out of the mouth of the principal show me a contract his
[3:18:43.520 --> 3:18:48.400]  problem is he doesn't know who the principal is he sees these foreclosures
[3:18:48.400 --> 3:18:52.960]  being these documents being filed with the court and they just pick them up and
[3:18:52.960 --> 3:18:56.440]  run with them whoever wins it gets the money all right we got to go to calls
[3:18:56.440 --> 3:19:00.200]  and we'll have you back again but but we've got more graphs there with that
[3:19:00.200 --> 3:19:02.880]  we'll cover after we take some calls but but Randy we're about to go to
[3:19:02.880 --> 3:19:07.440]  break but specifically again that 200 plus cases and you're having what
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:12.800]  success primarily we're keeping people in their houses it takes nearly two to
[3:19:12.800 --> 3:19:16.200]  two and a half years to get through a lawsuit and we started this a year ago
[3:19:16.200 --> 3:19:20.280]  most everybody's still in their houses and it's expensive with lawyers but when
[3:19:20.280 --> 3:19:23.800]  people you teach them how to do it pro say it's not it's not you can afford to
[3:19:23.800 --> 3:19:27.960]  to kick them in their teeth and it keeps you in the house this is the greatest
[3:19:27.960 --> 3:19:35.640]  value because property values are falling like a stone and by the year 2012
[3:19:35.640 --> 3:19:42.480]  if you bought a house in 07 for 300,000 you'll be lucky to get 80 we know that
[3:19:42.480 --> 3:19:49.480]  the banks know that they know their worst enemy is time as time goes on the
[3:19:49.480 --> 3:19:53.040]  banks build up more properties they can't get rid of they're just gonna make
[3:19:53.040 --> 3:19:57.920]  them want so you don't make it easy for them exactly all right we're gonna be

[3:24:31.320 --> 3:24:37.320]  phone calls 1-800-259-9031 Randy has got a bunch of different websites for his
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:40.040]  radio show other things he does and dealing with regular government
[3:24:40.040 --> 3:24:45.480]  corruption but mortgagecrimes.com is the main side if you want to contact him
[3:24:45.480 --> 3:24:50.240]  and then get more information mortgagecrimes.com let's go ahead and
[3:24:50.240 --> 3:24:55.640]  go to George in Connecticut you're on the air thanks for holding hi Randy I
[3:24:55.640 --> 3:24:59.800]  have a question it looks like the banks are trying to do an end run by either
[3:24:59.800 --> 3:25:05.000]  using shell companies and buying back the mortgages so that the taxpayer gets
[3:25:05.000 --> 3:25:09.440]  stuck with the with the depreciation and has to write that off and then they buy
[3:25:09.440 --> 3:25:13.160]  back and sell it at a depreciation right but the other thing is they're also
[3:25:13.160 --> 3:25:16.640]  going in and buying buying tax certificates now I was thinking of
[3:25:16.640 --> 3:25:20.240]  helping a lot of people out of going going by the tax certificates and selling
[3:25:20.240 --> 3:25:23.320]  back to them so they could wipe everything clean but the banks are also
[3:25:23.320 --> 3:25:27.200]  going into that too so I mean it looks like the banks are trying to commit
[3:25:27.200 --> 3:25:30.800]  fraud on several levels by by sticking the taxpayer with with with the
[3:25:30.800 --> 3:25:34.880]  depreciation. Oh no that's admitted by Timberwolfe and Goldman Sachs that they
[3:25:34.880 --> 3:25:39.480]  bundle the goodies the good mortgages for themselves and then sell retirement
[3:25:39.480 --> 3:25:44.600]  funds police funds governments the cruds you're absolutely right so they they
[3:25:44.600 --> 3:25:50.480]  steal our our equity on the front end on the back end they steal our retirement
[3:25:50.480 --> 3:25:54.640]  funds and in the middle they steal all our tax money yeah they make us bail it
[3:25:54.640 --> 3:26:00.440]  out and then they don't even use it for what they said anything else George no I
[3:26:00.440 --> 3:26:04.160]  just say how do you stop them is there a way to stop them from from committing
[3:26:04.160 --> 3:26:07.440]  another fraud by buying up all the tax certificates and then buying them a shell
[3:26:07.440 --> 3:26:12.760]  company and basically defrauding us one more time out of the same deal can't
[3:26:12.760 --> 3:26:16.220]  answer that one that's one I haven't researched yet but you can see I mean we
[3:26:16.220 --> 3:26:20.240]  have the emails and the documents and major publications like
[3:26:20.240 --> 3:26:24.280]  McClatchy have detailed it and so has Congress they set this thing up I mean
[3:26:24.280 --> 3:26:31.520]  this was this was set up this that's in me looking at this all of these pieces I
[3:26:31.520 --> 3:26:37.160]  have this graphed if you can go to that one what they're doing is very complex
[3:26:37.160 --> 3:26:41.600]  all of these mechanizations before securitization you wouldn't have found
[3:26:41.600 --> 3:26:45.960]  any of that in there you'd have found the lender the before the end of Glass
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:48.960]  Stegel that made all this a felony because we'd been through this before
[3:26:48.960 --> 3:26:53.680]  before that none of this was going on great points George we're going to
[3:26:53.680 --> 3:26:56.920]  market others a minute but tell us about this chart the securitization flow
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:01.960]  chart yeah this this shows how the security instrument moves how the money
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:06.120]  moves how the documents move the primary importance of this one is how
[3:27:06.120 --> 3:27:12.400]  complex it is attorneys they don't have time to do the research we have about
[3:27:12.400 --> 3:27:16.840]  a hundred thousand dollars invested in research on this one and you're now all
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:19.680]  of the country advising law firms I mean you're meeting with lawyers yes
[3:27:19.680 --> 3:27:23.440]  because they don't have time to do all of this I'm also building the litigation
[3:27:23.440 --> 3:27:29.320]  engine a computer program that never forgets any of this okay so go over this
[3:27:29.320 --> 3:27:33.940]  graph where do I start here so we start with the it's hard to tell from the
[3:27:33.940 --> 3:27:39.200]  graph because it starts with the the loan broker the loan broker brings the
[3:27:39.200 --> 3:27:45.520]  new a real estate agent will bring you to a broker the broker will find you a
[3:27:45.520 --> 3:27:50.040]  mortgage company to write your note well what you don't know is he always finds
[3:27:50.040 --> 3:27:57.960]  the same one because he's in bed with him and the loan broker pays the agents
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:28:02.240]  who bring them the note extra fees according to the one settlement
[3:28:02.240 --> 3:28:06.560]  according to the real estate similar procedures act the commission for
[3:28:06.560 --> 3:28:10.760]  bringing in a loan can be no more than one percent of the principal but they
[3:28:10.760 --> 3:28:15.520]  never come away from with less than two or three percent they pay them that under
[3:28:15.520 --> 3:28:21.120]  the table to bring them loans that are more expensive they pay the broke the
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:27.640]  the agents to breach their fiduciary duty to the borrower and upsell the note
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:32.920]  convince him that he only qualifies for a much more expensive loan product than
[3:28:32.920 --> 3:28:41.480]  he actually does the very first item there the mortgage company he appears
[3:28:41.480 --> 3:28:46.000]  to be a mortgage company but he's really not that's this that's that he only
[3:28:46.000 --> 3:28:51.240]  appears to be because way down at the back the last one on the top the the
[3:28:51.240 --> 3:28:58.360]  investor the investor who buys from well this this whole process in order for
[3:28:58.360 --> 3:29:01.400]  the security instrument to get to the final investor it has to go through four
[3:29:01.400 --> 3:29:09.000]  steps the aggregator the special purpose vehicle that's where the loans are put
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:15.480]  together it appears from our research that they are actually the owners of the
[3:29:15.480 --> 3:29:20.480]  mortgage company so it appears as though the mortgage company sells the note to
[3:29:20.480 --> 3:29:26.000]  the aggregator when in fact they're one in the same company they've all set this
[3:29:26.000 --> 3:29:29.760]  up so they can run through these different mechanisms and then they gave
[3:29:29.760 --> 3:29:36.840]  the word hey realtors local loan originators everybody's allowed to do
[3:29:36.840 --> 3:29:41.160]  this tell people to lie to originate the fraud down at the bottom when the
[3:29:41.160 --> 3:29:44.360]  person gets the loan they create a mortgage company that does the fraud
[3:29:44.360 --> 3:29:49.280]  then they bankrupt the mortgage company so he appears to disappear that's like
[3:29:49.280 --> 3:29:51.600]  in wrong they already move the money out the back we're gonna come out more
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:58.440]  calls we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio

[3:34:08.580 --> 3:34:34.300]  just like earlier I had the ice legal on has been beating him and having big effect one of the first to successfully do it in the last three four years. We had them on we're gonna have more people on because I want to help people that's our mission just like read the insert on a flu shot says again brain damage is sterilize you know I feel good at night warning people about that and it all came out we were right last year or sodium fluoride gives you can give you cancer filter your water.
[3:34:34.300 --> 3:34:42.140]  Or there after our second amendment here's the legislation or they're trying to pass amnesty here's the legislation we're just here to alert you.
[3:34:42.140 --> 3:34:53.900]  That hey you know here's the University of Exeter big report research proves gender bending chemicals like bisphenol a affecting reproduction feminizing boys hyper feminizing women causing cancer.
[3:34:53.900 --> 3:34:57.900]  Yeah we're just here warning you telling you what's going on.
[3:34:57.900 --> 3:35:04.180]  Kind of like you're driving on the road and seventy miles an hour to the country you see a sign saying twenty mile an hour turn.
[3:35:04.180 --> 3:35:09.940]  If you don't slow down folks you're gonna go flying right off the edge and you know here's the deal we're all in this together.
[3:35:09.940 --> 3:35:16.420]  When you warn your neighbors when you warn your friends and family when you buy my books and videos and support us and get tools like follow the republic.
[3:35:16.420 --> 3:35:27.820]  An invisible empire that show people who really runs things we're identifying the crooks so that is things get worse and worse as they planned they won't be able to pose as our saviors and get even more power they're gonna go to prison.
[3:35:27.820 --> 3:35:39.140]  And look how far we've come passing a bill this year to audit the Fed sure they butchered it in the Senate but we've gone from Ron Paul with no cosponsors fifteen years ago to passing bills.
[3:35:39.140 --> 3:35:49.300]  Now the globalist identified as the criminals as a bigger presence he admitted four months ago humanity is awakened staring at them we're identifying the bad guy.
[3:35:49.300 --> 3:36:02.820]  And as G.I. Joe says knowing the bad guy is half the battle that's why they told us homeland security was for guys with turbines on their heads now they admit it's for us because they're the bad guys staging the terror attacks as a pretext to come after us.
[3:36:02.820 --> 3:36:12.060]  And they're coming after us militarily economically psychologically spiritually medically physically and this is one big area financially.
[3:36:12.060 --> 3:36:22.740]  Because money is a symbol of energy and that's how they buy up the whole world for nothing out of their fraud as Thomas Jefferson said and we're waking up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered.
[3:36:22.740 --> 3:36:31.540]  Now going back to Randy Kelton I want to get to these calls as quickly as possible I just talked to who's up first here all these callers.
[3:36:31.540 --> 3:37:01.260]  All right Mark and P. we're going to move quick now Mark go ahead I commend you Mr. Kelton for all you're all you're doing I've listened to you last week you got me on the edge of my seat the challenge here to me is that the battle that's before us is a temporary battle that's a significant battle but my concern is what's on the other side of this this is the foundational aspect of who we are as a free people the property rights of an individual and after they come after the property were they going to come after next.
[3:37:01.260 --> 3:37:31.020]  As individuals and so to me this whole thing is their it's their party it's their casino like Max Kaiser says and and and it's all based upon the universe the UTC and all of that so we're dealing there in their area so on the other side of this we have to wait to meet you have to wake up get to the core core issue of what real property rights are what it really means to be free so I mean this is just that to me it's a distraction.
[3:37:31.020 --> 3:37:45.860]  And they're just playing a game with us and and and can and strengthen us out and and keep the list and mark I appreciate your call we got to move on you know all the patriot folks with the UPC stuff that I've been seeing for 15 years has rendered almost no success.
[3:37:45.860 --> 3:37:52.180]  This is rendering serious success charging them with fraud because they've engaged in it.
[3:37:52.180 --> 3:38:12.940]  And this is not an exercise in fertility it's having a big effect and I never understand why when we're up here with real solutions people people say well it's their party it's their system yes it's their fraudulent system and we're here exposing it just exposing their fraud again is half the equation.
[3:38:12.940 --> 3:38:22.020]  Okay and I'm glad you you've mentioned that point because frankly I'm not here primarily for foreclosure issues.
[3:38:22.020 --> 3:38:37.620]  Alex knows my primary focus it's grand juries I've been helping people with due process issues and I tell them the worst one the key to all of this is the judge go there and kick that judge and he's behind and they say I'm not gonna do that I can go to jail.
[3:38:37.620 --> 3:38:53.860]  But when I got someone with a foreclosure issue where they're stealing his house and everything he owns but his liberties not at risk and I say that dirty rotten scoundrel judges breaking the law you need to go down file current complaints with him that's what you mean by kicking him in the bud yes.
[3:38:53.860 --> 3:39:00.860]  You use the grand jury against them I just did a seminar in Las Vegas of people who help other people.
[3:39:00.860 --> 3:39:08.220]  And they weren't so interested in hearing about the foreclosure issue they already knew about it they want to know how to go after the judges.
[3:39:08.220 --> 3:39:19.460]  We get people going after the judges we will change everything and people don't do it because they say they're invincible they're not invincible they're actually the weakest link.
[3:39:19.460 --> 3:39:32.260]  I have stood in court a number of times and said to the bailiff did you hear that Mr bailiff drag that judge down off that bench I have never once had a judge threaten me with the contempt for doing that to him.
[3:39:32.260 --> 3:39:38.140]  He knew he's in deep water here the judges know they're the weakest link.
[3:39:38.140 --> 3:39:49.300]  The last thing they want you to know is how vulnerable they are and with these foreclosure issues I can get people to real that's like the baby they took in New Hampshire putting a fake criminal record in it.
[3:39:49.300 --> 3:39:59.540]  For somebody else and everything and because it was political pressure when they got up there before the judge the judge said there's not enough evidence release the baby but but see they had the will to fight.
[3:39:59.540 --> 3:40:14.580]  Most people just roll over exactly and this is the key and look they can't stop us all let's go to another caller mark I understand your part of your point but the rest of it is this is having an effect people are staying in their houses.
[3:40:14.580 --> 3:40:22.100]  I mean I don't know what else you want I mean this is the this is a real remedy let's talk to Shannon in Mississippi thanks for holding.
[3:40:22.100 --> 3:40:30.100]  Hey how you doing good got a question for Mr Randy Mr Randy I know you probably heard about it but my mom.
[3:40:30.100 --> 3:40:44.580]  And my real dad got a divorce and then she married a Air Force veteran in the Air Force of 28 years well he died and they gave her a silver certificate one time buyers plan on a house.
[3:40:44.580 --> 3:41:04.500]  Well my mom she went and bought a house like a land and back in the two thousand and two she bought it and it was like a hundred and forty thousand dollars okay now my mom has died and under that silver certificate through the military.
[3:41:04.500 --> 3:41:18.980]  Are they any insurance if they come and try to take that house because we missed one payment on it are they any insurance we could take to the grand jury to say hey no you can't do this.
[3:41:18.980 --> 3:41:33.060]  That's my question I'm not familiar with the silver certificate is that at some type of guarantee against foreclosure is that like some kind of.
[3:41:33.060 --> 3:41:41.540]  Well it was a one time buyers plan understood from my mom before she died through the United States Air Force saying that they would.
[3:41:41.540 --> 3:41:53.060]  Give her the money or credit her a certain amount I believe it was up to a hundred and fifty thousand she bought the house for like a hundred and forty.
[3:41:53.060 --> 3:42:06.180]  And now I'm kind of scared and worried that through it was through the United States Air Force and the government they could come in and just swipe it out from under the family.
[3:42:06.180 --> 3:42:14.900]  So has anybody has any did she have the did you have a clear title to it or did you have a mortgage.
[3:42:14.900 --> 3:42:28.820]  I wanted it to ask you the only thing that was not at the paper signing or anything that I could see was a clear title or deed how would I know about okay.
[3:42:28.820 --> 3:42:31.940]  Is there a mortgage on the property.
[3:42:31.940 --> 3:42:39.140]  Yes they are did your it was is this a mortgage from the original purchase.
[3:42:39.140 --> 3:42:47.060]  The mortgage from the original purchase which I would assume would be through the military.
[3:42:47.060 --> 3:42:51.620]  Well this is what I'm getting at did the military.
[3:42:51.620 --> 3:43:01.140]  Was the original purchase of the home did it have a mortgage on it then or is this a refinance later.
[3:43:01.140 --> 3:43:06.260]  Sir it was a refinance later the military.
[3:43:06.260 --> 3:43:09.940]  Okay did yeah I think you're gonna have to send Randy.
[3:43:09.940 --> 3:43:13.460]  Listen you're gonna have to send Randy an email or something because this is just Shannon.
[3:43:13.460 --> 3:43:16.580]  I mean we've never heard of this so we're not exactly sure what you're getting into.
[3:43:16.580 --> 3:43:18.740]  Sorry we can't answer your question properly.
[3:43:18.740 --> 3:43:21.060]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kim in Indiana.
[3:43:21.060 --> 3:43:22.580]  Go ahead.
[3:43:22.580 --> 3:43:23.220]  Hello.
[3:43:23.220 --> 3:43:24.340]  Yes go ahead.
[3:43:24.340 --> 3:43:26.180]  I have a question for Randy.
[3:43:26.180 --> 3:43:31.220]  I've got my property which I do hold the deed for it is paid for.
[3:43:31.220 --> 3:43:37.540]  For example my house would go into foreclosure could they still come and take my house about my
[3:43:37.540 --> 3:43:40.580]  properties paid for.
[3:43:40.580 --> 3:43:42.500]  How do they have a lien against it.
[3:43:42.500 --> 3:43:45.220]  I mean no I've got the deed for my property.
[3:43:45.220 --> 3:43:49.860]  So what I'm saying is paid for but I got a mortgage on my house.
[3:43:49.860 --> 3:43:55.460]  Then yes based on the mortgage the mortgage gives them a claim against the the title.
[3:43:56.660 --> 3:43:59.620]  While you hold the title and the title is in your name.
[3:43:59.620 --> 3:44:01.460]  Uh huh.
[3:44:01.460 --> 3:44:08.740]  The mortgage gives them the mortgage or a I'm sorry the mortgagee a claim against the title
[3:44:09.540 --> 3:44:14.980]  in the event that you don't meet the requirements of the the note the security answer.
[3:44:14.980 --> 3:44:19.140]  Are you talking about the warranty date on the entire property or any conventions on that.
[3:44:19.140 --> 3:44:22.740]  I mean is there a separate piece of property have you subdivided it or are you talking about just
[3:44:22.740 --> 3:44:23.620]  the house.
[3:44:23.620 --> 3:44:27.460]  I'm just talking about that that property that sits on the house.
[3:44:27.460 --> 3:44:29.460]  Yeah absolutely they can foreclose.
[3:44:29.460 --> 3:44:30.660]  They still can foreclose.
[3:44:30.660 --> 3:44:31.940]  Okay that's all I need to know.
[3:44:32.980 --> 3:44:34.420]  All right thank you.
[3:44:34.420 --> 3:44:39.540]  Yeah with that said if they've done this within the last 10 years the note if you
[3:44:39.540 --> 3:44:43.620]  fight them they won't have authority to foreclose almost certainly.
[3:44:44.340 --> 3:44:47.380]  Because they clouded the entire chain of titles since then.
[3:44:47.380 --> 3:44:48.740]  Exactly you can fight them.
[3:44:48.740 --> 3:44:53.700]  All right let's go ahead yeah this is different if you've got a house bought before 11 years ago
[3:44:53.700 --> 3:44:54.340]  on average.
[3:44:54.340 --> 3:44:55.220]  Yes.
[3:44:55.220 --> 3:44:57.860]  They can probably take it because it was done properly.
[3:44:57.860 --> 3:45:02.180]  But unless if they securitize the note then they'll have a problem.
[3:45:02.180 --> 3:45:05.540]  Oh so stuff that's even older than 11 years if they've sold it since.
[3:45:05.540 --> 3:45:07.620]  Yeah they started about 95.
[3:45:07.620 --> 3:45:13.540]  Oh okay all right let's go ahead and talk to Bill in Florida then Ronnie Ken and others.
[3:45:14.500 --> 3:45:16.740]  Bill drop let's go to Ken in Indiana.
[3:45:16.740 --> 3:45:18.180]  Ken in Indiana you're on the air.
[3:45:20.180 --> 3:45:20.660]  Hello.
[3:45:20.660 --> 3:45:21.380]  Yes go ahead.
[3:45:22.180 --> 3:45:26.420]  Can you explain again Randy the difference between the truth and lending statement and
[3:45:26.420 --> 3:45:32.420]  the HUD one and how to figure that out and what are the fees that the lender can't charge that
[3:45:32.420 --> 3:45:33.860]  you're saying are illegal.
[3:45:33.860 --> 3:45:40.580]  Okay truth and lending statement the truth and lending statement it's one page and it will
[3:45:40.580 --> 3:45:46.900]  right across the middle it'll have four boxes it'll show the interest rate the total amount of
[3:45:46.900 --> 3:45:53.620]  interest you'll pay the total amount of principal and the principal and interest combined.
[3:45:53.620 --> 3:45:56.900]  And then under that will be a section that'll show what your payments will be.
[3:45:57.860 --> 3:46:04.020]  Now this is required to be within an eighth of a percent of what the final amount is you're
[3:46:04.020 --> 3:46:10.660]  supposed to get a truth and lending statement after you file the loan application and then
[3:46:10.660 --> 3:46:13.620]  a final truth and lending statement within three days of closing.
[3:46:13.620 --> 3:46:16.420]  That you normally see it right there in the in the signing.
[3:46:16.420 --> 3:46:22.580]  The HUD one settlement statement that's the two page legal size document with lines all over it
[3:46:22.580 --> 3:46:25.780]  it goes from line 100 to line 1400.
[3:46:26.580 --> 3:46:32.980]  The second page starts at line 700 those that lists all the fees you pay at closing.
[3:46:34.580 --> 3:46:38.340]  Now you look at those fees there's a loan origination fee.
[3:46:39.060 --> 3:46:44.180]  That's a fee that's paid to a vendor that's paid to the person as a commission for bringing them
[3:46:44.180 --> 3:46:50.500]  the note that can be no more than one percent of the note if you look down below it you sometimes
[3:46:50.500 --> 3:46:54.740]  see a yield spread premium. That's exactly the same thing.
[3:46:54.740 --> 3:46:58.740]  I've seen two yield spread premiums at a loan origination it origination fee.
[3:46:58.740 --> 3:47:02.660]  So they'll triple charge under different names and is that federal law that they're not allowed
[3:47:02.660 --> 3:47:08.020]  to do that. That's federal law the truth and lending at the real estate settlement procedures
[3:47:08.020 --> 3:47:13.700]  act and truth and lending act specifically limit what the lender can charge the borrow.
[3:47:13.700 --> 3:47:15.540]  But then how do they get away with doing it.
[3:47:15.540 --> 3:47:21.140]  People don't know. So they have you sign that you know about the truth and lending but you waive it.
[3:47:21.860 --> 3:47:27.540]  No they don't even do that. The lenders call these junk fees.
[3:47:28.660 --> 3:47:33.780]  They just stuff them in there and what we've done is pulled a dirty stinking rotten lawyer
[3:47:33.780 --> 3:47:42.900]  trick on them. We claim that they added these fees in there so that they could their extra fees
[3:47:42.900 --> 3:47:47.780]  it was intended that all of these costs be absorbed in the interest that they charge you.
[3:47:49.300 --> 3:47:52.980]  Part of the finance charge but they added them to the head of the note.
[3:47:52.980 --> 3:47:58.420]  They charge you interest on them for 30 years and we maintain they take those amounts and they slip
[3:47:58.420 --> 3:48:02.580]  them under the table to the loan originator because now there's interest on fees that have
[3:48:02.580 --> 3:48:07.060]  already been jacked up. Yes and that they don't even give it the opportunity to pay a separate
[3:48:07.060 --> 3:48:15.220]  check flat off for that. On a 6% note if they add $1,000 to the principal you'll pay $5,900
[3:48:15.220 --> 3:48:19.220]  over the life of the note. And on average with $300,000 house you're saying is over 40.
[3:48:19.220 --> 3:48:22.900]  Yes. All right I hope that answers your question. I appreciate the call.
[3:48:23.860 --> 3:48:26.020]  Up next here John I got my list confused.
[3:48:28.260 --> 3:48:31.620]  Mike and Louisiana you're on the air with Randy Kelton and Alex Jones go ahead.
[3:48:31.620 --> 3:48:35.140]  Hey Alex long time listener really appreciate the show. I've got a question for your
[3:48:35.140 --> 3:48:41.140]  for your guest. I'm in the mortgage business and he's thrown out some of the terms but as far as
[3:48:41.140 --> 3:48:46.100]  the limitation on a 1% origination being the maximum amount you can charge on a loan that's only
[3:48:46.980 --> 3:48:52.740]  for FHA loans. For conventional loans for what used to be non-conforming loans so Primalté
[3:48:53.380 --> 3:48:58.420]  you could charge more than 1% but the FHA limits you to 1% and there's other fees that
[3:48:58.420 --> 3:49:04.340]  are not allowable fees. Lenders can choose to itemize their fees based on the services that
[3:49:04.340 --> 3:49:09.060]  they provide. If you have a processor that you're outsourcing you can choose to pay her separately
[3:49:09.060 --> 3:49:15.300]  and things like that. The reference to the yield spread premium in the form of a payment outside
[3:49:15.300 --> 3:49:20.740]  of closing when the loan is sold. I used to be a broker, a mortgage broker who's been the whipping
[3:49:20.740 --> 3:49:26.660]  boy for this whole industry for the last three years and what happened is we would originate the
[3:49:26.660 --> 3:49:32.260]  loan and get paid for that and also based on the interest rate that we were able to sell
[3:49:32.260 --> 3:49:39.300]  in the free market at let's say the going rate was 5 and we sold a 5% rate that might be par
[3:49:39.300 --> 3:49:44.020]  meaning there was no yield spread premium and it has to be disclosed on the good faith estimate
[3:49:44.020 --> 3:49:47.540]  and it also has to be disclosed on the HUD 1 settlement statement in a certain block and he
[3:49:47.540 --> 3:49:54.260]  referenced those. However, if you sold the loan at 5.25 that extra quarter point in rate would
[3:49:54.260 --> 3:49:58.580]  mean that you might get a yield spread premium of let's say 1%. I know we don't want to get
[3:49:58.580 --> 3:50:06.900]  too obtuse on a radio show but section 32 is the law that regulates how much an originator can make
[3:50:06.900 --> 3:50:12.340]  and it's more than 1%. Well here's a simple question I want Randy to be able to comment on
[3:50:12.340 --> 3:50:18.660]  this and we're skipping this final break. It's real simple before 99 or so they would not go
[3:50:18.660 --> 3:50:26.340]  out and induce people, the brokers and others to exaggerate how much money they make or whatever
[3:50:26.340 --> 3:50:31.300]  and the loan officers and I'm just boiling almost down to simplistic terms above it
[3:50:31.300 --> 3:50:36.740]  wouldn't certify it but something changed and we've all heard about that and I understand
[3:50:36.740 --> 3:50:40.580]  the whipping boys when the low level people we're talking about the big mega banks that engineered
[3:50:40.580 --> 3:50:44.580]  all this so I'm not saying you're the devil you were going through your industry and what was
[3:50:44.580 --> 3:50:48.980]  standard operating procedure just like giving somebody chemotherapy is because the American
[3:50:48.980 --> 3:50:55.220]  Medical Association says so but I mean specifically things did change and the whole
[3:50:55.220 --> 3:50:58.900]  thing's grinding to a halt I mean bottom line what are you saying to Randy that he's wrong
[3:51:00.740 --> 3:51:05.300]  in the charge I guess that gets him in the court by making the change the charge on the fraud
[3:51:05.300 --> 3:51:10.900]  and then you can pull up as you alluded to earlier you can pull up the show me the note argument
[3:51:10.900 --> 3:51:15.060]  but the pull up the fraud thing with the the interest rate on the truth and lending is an
[3:51:15.060 --> 3:51:20.100]  APR it's an annual percentage rate it's the cost of your loan in the form of an interest rate over
[3:51:20.100 --> 3:51:24.660]  the full term of the loan because they they the federal government and their wisdom wanted to make
[3:51:24.660 --> 3:51:30.740]  it easy for clients or for customers to compare my rate comment on this because it's getting all
[3:51:30.740 --> 3:51:39.380]  academic the the issue we bring the note is very clear you sign this contract and you say I agree
[3:51:39.380 --> 3:51:46.660]  to pay this amount of principal at this interest and then the the lender comes along with this other
[3:51:46.660 --> 3:51:52.660]  document that has a different principle on it and a different interest and when I run the two of them
[3:51:52.660 --> 3:51:59.140]  the one with the different principle in interest doesn't come up with the same cost to me as what
[3:51:59.140 --> 3:52:03.620]  I agreed to you're saying the fraud is people are shown one bill and then on the final day another
[3:52:03.620 --> 3:52:08.980]  bill there that's because you could go to bank one and get five percent and and they charge you
[3:52:08.980 --> 3:52:12.980]  two thousand dollars for five percent loan for 30 years and bank number two is going to charge
[3:52:12.980 --> 3:52:16.740]  you twenty five hundred dollars for it and so the truth in lending the whole point of that was to
[3:52:16.740 --> 3:52:21.780]  help you determine what that bank two is charging you more well and then they quantify it in the form
[3:52:21.780 --> 3:52:26.100]  of an interest rate I looked at the truth in lending statement I'm not sure what you're quantifying
[3:52:26.100 --> 3:52:31.940]  I know I sign a note and it says I agree to pay x amount of principal at expound interest
[3:52:32.820 --> 3:52:38.340]  how does it get that how does it get that the truth in lending statement has a payment
[3:52:39.700 --> 3:52:46.740]  amount all right if if I pay that payment I will pay thousands and thousands more than
[3:52:46.740 --> 3:52:54.420]  what I agreed to that's listed on the truth in lending matches the note rate absolutely it does
[3:52:54.420 --> 3:53:00.420]  about 25 percent of the time well if the other my carries over to that so you might be mistakenly
[3:53:00.420 --> 3:53:06.100]  looking at a truth in lending that has a PI plus a PMI charge on there and it not computing because
[3:53:06.100 --> 3:53:11.060]  the people didn't put down 20% hey why don't you why don't you uh I bet you'd like to talk to Mike
[3:53:11.060 --> 3:53:17.700]  off air yes I would so send him an email there at mortgagecrimes.com or or Randy what's an email for
[3:53:17.700 --> 3:53:23.700]  you that would be a great one I just go to that side it's got it right there Mike very interesting
[3:53:23.700 --> 3:53:29.380]  I tell you I study this stuff all the time and I get confused by it let's go ahead and talk to Dan
[3:53:29.380 --> 3:53:36.100]  in Texas Dan you're on the air yeah yes this is Dan Texas I'm having basically the same problem
[3:53:36.100 --> 3:53:41.540]  here it is quite academic I'm looking at your website and I'm trying to see I don't actually
[3:53:41.540 --> 3:53:45.860]  know what an 801 is or a HUD one settlement I don't know what these things look like and I'm
[3:53:45.860 --> 3:53:49.940]  wondering if you have a complete example something that we can look at front to back and learn how
[3:53:49.940 --> 3:53:54.260]  to choose or no he's just giving you basic things for you to go dig it out yourself and look at it
[3:53:54.260 --> 3:54:01.300]  yeah you can if you if you look in your loan package uh the HUD one is really easy to locate
[3:54:01.300 --> 3:54:08.420]  it's the only one that's just it has lines all down the document uh we should I haven't looked at
[3:54:08.420 --> 3:54:15.780]  the the website today but we should have a a HUD one interactive on the website that you can open
[3:54:15.780 --> 3:54:21.620]  up and fill in the amount yeah but let's be clear we had a lawyer on earlier uh from ice legal who's
[3:54:21.620 --> 3:54:25.700]  in the wall street journal winning these cases just to hear what he had to say just like we're
[3:54:25.700 --> 3:54:29.940]  hearing from Randy Randy's involved in a whole bunch of stuff as a pro se litigant he's not there
[3:54:29.940 --> 3:54:34.100]  to hold everybody's hand through this we're just talking about general issues that are going on
[3:54:34.100 --> 3:54:39.300]  and Randy's now trying to develop and codify all this this is all the work in progress we you know
[3:54:39.300 --> 3:54:43.700]  we're not we don't have all the answers I certainly don't I'm just here investigating all this from
[3:54:43.700 --> 3:54:48.900]  different perspectives yeah and this issue of the the truth and lending statement I've had a number
[3:54:48.900 --> 3:54:54.740]  of people that I've talked to about the truth and lending statement and it always comes up different
[3:54:54.740 --> 3:55:02.100]  I never can get anything clear and definitive that tells me why Steve was required to pay
[3:55:02.100 --> 3:55:08.980]  $720 a month on the truth and lending when the note he agreed to came up to $693
[3:55:10.740 --> 3:55:15.460]  couldn't figure that one out all right I get it I'll have to look at your website listen I gotta
[3:55:15.460 --> 3:55:20.100]  I gotta jump thank you guys interesting points Dan Pablo in Oregon you're on the air go ahead
[3:55:20.100 --> 3:55:27.940]  Dan yes Alex yes Alex okay um um let's see be real quick um I trade currency I've been
[3:55:27.940 --> 3:55:32.980]  trading currency for the last 10 years um I worked at the Chicago Mercantile exchange worked at the
[3:55:32.980 --> 3:55:39.780]  board trade um traded bonds there for for a for a for a while and uh I've been following this all
[3:55:39.780 --> 3:55:44.980]  super super close the whole the whole collapse the whole Ponzi scheme and uh my mother has
[3:55:44.980 --> 3:55:51.620]  um about $500,000 um saved up my father with a professor when we passed away I understand and um
[3:55:51.620 --> 3:55:59.540]  she and uh the uh the brokers had put a a large amount of it into a black rock uh which holds
[3:55:59.540 --> 3:56:06.580]  um a lot of these um collateral collateralized mortgage obligations and uh and um I've been
[3:56:06.580 --> 3:56:13.620]  slowly getting her to get into the SLV and GLDs and um and so today she uh she wanted to um
[3:56:13.620 --> 3:56:20.820]  she wanted to uh uh uh to liquidate the uh the black rock funds and put into SLVs and and they
[3:56:20.820 --> 3:56:27.380]  and they refuse to do it and and my mother uh asked them okay are you are you um are you
[3:56:27.380 --> 3:56:33.300]  are are are you not willing to do it or do you not want to do it and they they respond to we're
[3:56:33.300 --> 3:56:38.980]  not going to do it so just lawlessly lawlessly not giving people the other money and this is
[3:56:38.980 --> 3:56:44.260]  happening more and more they're now trying to just take pensions Randy yes and and I expect
[3:56:44.260 --> 3:56:48.340]  this to get a whole lot worse it may well be that they don't have the money to give back to them
[3:56:49.140 --> 3:56:54.180]  if they've got it in bad investments but but this is not a place for me to comment on because
[3:56:54.180 --> 3:57:00.020]  this gets into invest yeah what's your bottom line Pablo what are you saying uh basically they
[3:57:00.020 --> 3:57:05.460]  told her she she was she was incompetent uh manager her own money and I told her that that this
[3:57:05.460 --> 3:57:10.020]  was a perfect example and this was a good uh uh that this was a godsend that this happened
[3:57:10.020 --> 3:57:16.100]  because it in another situation where the market flashes down another 20 followed by a following
[3:57:16.100 --> 3:57:20.900]  day another flash down 20 yeah well her yeah I mean you will never get out of your money yeah
[3:57:20.900 --> 3:57:25.300]  yeah we're out of time Pablo I appreciate your call I mean right there that's where
