[00:00:05.721 --> 00:00:07.021]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.021 --> 00:00:08.802]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.802 --> 00:00:10.562]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:12.143]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.143 --> 00:00:13.683]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.683 --> 00:00:17.884]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:21.985]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:31.388]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:31.388 --> 00:00:32.328]  Welcome.
[00:00:32.328 --> 00:00:34.909]  It is Thursday, the 28th day of October, 2010.
[00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:41.132]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours today, going into overdrive.
[00:00:42.523 --> 00:01:06.156]  We have a lawyer, Dustin Zaks, who was quoted in the Wall Street Journal as being one of the major law firms that first won victories against the big mortgage firms and began to expose in the last three years the systemic endemic fraud at the heart of the mortgage system.
[00:01:07.642 --> 00:01:10.225]  The fact that they're scamming you with all the fees they add.
[00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:15.052]  The fact that they don't have the deed chain of custody.
[00:01:15.052 --> 00:01:18.696]  We're going to have him on coming up in an hour and a half today.
[00:01:18.696 --> 00:01:20.619]  Dustin Zaks.
[00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.524]  Look, I know we've got big election news and we've got economic news.
[00:01:24.524 --> 00:01:25.545]  We're going to cover all that too.
[00:01:26.346 --> 00:01:34.173]  It's just this mortgage issue is coming down like a ton of bricks and it illustrates the fraud of Wall Street and this corrupt system.
[00:01:34.173 --> 00:01:37.395]  So Dustin Zaks is going to be joining us.
[00:01:37.395 --> 00:01:46.683]  There's a key article in the Wall Street Journal I saw a week ago back on October 21st and in the next few weeks we're going to get multiple lawyers on that are quoted in here.
[00:01:46.683 --> 00:01:53.448]  They've got three different law firms and then several separate individual lawyers who have been successfully
[00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.852]  Keeping people in their houses, in some cases, for six years after foreclosure begins.
[00:01:59.852 --> 00:02:02.073]  Six years.
[00:02:02.073 --> 00:02:10.058]  And we've been doing other research on the lawyers and pro se litigants and people that are having success against the banksters.
[00:02:10.058 --> 00:02:16.041]  That doesn't mean there's some silver, all-powerful bullet that will give you 100% victory.
[00:02:16.041 --> 00:02:22.145]  But we know if you go to the average real estate law firm, they will just take your money and do absolutely nothing.
[00:02:23.072 --> 00:02:30.683]  And so I thought I would go over some of the tactics that are actually working and expose the fraud.
[00:02:30.683 --> 00:02:35.110]  And that means even if you are paying for your house, you're not upside down.
[00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:40.781]  But you were cheated on the fees and things and the closing cost.
[00:02:40.781 --> 00:02:41.762]  You've got an issue.
[00:02:41.762 --> 00:02:48.188]  Or if they've sold your loan over and over again, they may try to come in and repossess it later even though you own your house.
[00:02:48.188 --> 00:02:49.049]  That's the issue.
[00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:59.799]  This isn't just people by the hundred plus thousand on average for the last year and a half straight, a hundred thousand a month out of their houses with foreclosures.
[00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.000]  It isn't just those people.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.121]  It's everybody.
[00:03:03.055 --> 00:03:12.599]  Because they've destroyed the property deed system, the common law system by design, the evidence shows, but it could backfire on these people.
[00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:29.526]  But it's a niche lawyers spawned housing fracas is the detailed article out of the Wall Street Journal that quotes these different lawyers that have been successful.
[00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:30.266]  In some cases,
[00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:36.729]  For six years keeping people in their houses.
[00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:38.852]  Six years without a payment.
[00:03:38.852 --> 00:03:40.374]  I think that's big.
[00:03:40.374 --> 00:03:42.957]  And the issue is, why are they able to do that?
[00:03:42.957 --> 00:03:44.499]  Because there's so much fraud involved.
[00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:51.734]  And then of course, we're going to do part two or now part three of our interview in studio with Randy Kelton, a pro se individual.
[00:03:51.734 --> 00:04:01.821]  When I've been doing my research on this, who's following some of the same tactics and going off the research of the successful pro se litigants and lawyers, but also adding a twist to it for going for a
[00:04:03.775 --> 00:04:04.656]  We're good to go.
[00:04:18.078 --> 00:04:21.461]  Several hours on this subject today.
[00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:25.904]  That said, I want to blitz through some of the most important news when we get back.
[00:04:25.904 --> 00:04:30.307]  And then for the next hour and a half, we're going to have nothing but wide open phones.
[00:04:30.307 --> 00:04:30.747]  1-800-259-9231.

[00:04:52.795 --> 00:04:54.798]  The economic news is amazing.
[00:04:54.798 --> 00:04:56.962]  The police state news is amazing.
[00:04:56.962 --> 00:04:58.945]  We're going to be breaking it all down today.

[00:08:05.799 --> 00:08:07.101]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.101 --> 00:08:08.863]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.863 --> 00:08:10.625]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.625 --> 00:08:12.207]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.207 --> 00:08:13.749]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:17.955]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.955 --> 00:08:22.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.222 --> 00:08:51.125]  Okay, let me just run over a overview of some of the news I've got here in front of me and then we're going to just take your phone calls because I know people are chomping at the bit to talk about all the electronic voting machine fraud, the ballots not sent to the military or the ballots lost, all of the news that's unfolding on the economy front, a bunch of health news, police state news,
[00:08:53.069 --> 00:09:14.840]  War news it's all coming up but I just want to commend and salute the listeners of this radio slash TV transmission because you made our two search terms yesterday number one and number two respectively and both of the terms traded places back and forth for the number one and number two slot throughout the evening yesterday one of them was
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:37.427]  Conway cover-up or Jack Conway the Democratic candidate for Senate in Kentucky the hottest race in the nation besides Angle and Reed in Nevada That became the number one search term and generated a lot of coverage and several newspapers did pick it up and hundreds and hundreds of blogs So we've got a chance if you keep getting that information out about the obstruction of justice that's admitted
[00:09:38.882 --> 00:09:39.282]  I don't know.
[00:09:54.784 --> 00:10:09.212]  Also 9-1-1 cover-up dealing with all of these NIST videos they suppressed now that have been released that detail bombs going off in Tower 1, 2, and 7, including the New York FBI director talking about it on video.
[00:10:09.212 --> 00:10:11.814]  We know why they tried to suppress this information.
[00:10:11.814 --> 00:10:16.256]  So great job to everybody out there that got the word out on that.
[00:10:16.256 --> 00:10:17.757]  It's our job now to contact
[00:10:18.177 --> 00:10:31.824]  The media, the TV stations, the radio stations to send them this information because it's come out in a few Kentucky newspapers a week ago but gotten almost no attention until you spread the word about it yesterday.
[00:10:31.824 --> 00:10:35.386]  But here's the headline for the article we need to get out to everybody.
[00:10:35.386 --> 00:10:41.229]  Conway cover-up media ignores admitted obstruction of justice.
[00:10:41.229 --> 00:10:46.913]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com is where you will find that article.
[00:10:48.107 --> 00:10:53.054]  And it's now been picked up by some other newspapers like Salem News and others.
[00:10:53.054 --> 00:10:59.183]  Drug issues plague Attorney General Jack Conway on Kentucky's bid for U.S.
[00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:00.024]  Senate.
[00:11:00.024 --> 00:11:02.808]  That's just some of the headlines that are out there.
[00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:07.231]  Right now, and I'll recap that story coming up.
[00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:14.214]  But you notice that talk about Aqua Buddha from 30 years ago in college with Rand Paul here in Texas.
[00:11:14.214 --> 00:11:17.616]  Talk of him not being a doctor, which is admitted to be a lie.
[00:11:17.616 --> 00:11:19.737]  That is still at fever pitch.
[00:11:19.737 --> 00:11:23.318]  I've been monitoring television and radio, and I know you have been as well, many of you.
[00:11:23.318 --> 00:11:24.199]  That's all you hear about.
[00:11:25.238 --> 00:11:42.065]  You wouldn't think the depression's a problem, the open borders are a problem, the takeover by the federal government of the internet through cyber security's a problem, you wouldn't think the systemic total mortgage fraud is a problem, the Federal Reserve announcing devaluation of the dollar, that's not a problem.
[00:11:42.065 --> 00:11:50.188]  The problem is that a woman reportedly ran up towards Rand Paul, and we didn't have the video of this,
[00:11:51.237 --> 00:12:00.061]  Because the MoveOn people had edited it, but the witnesses said she charged up to him in his vehicle, trying to throw something in his face.
[00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:10.486]  And now, for about a day and a half, the video has been on the web, big articles yesterday and today, at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com dealing with this.
[00:12:10.486 --> 00:12:15.029]  And its new video shows MoveOn activists attempting to assault Rand Paul.
[00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:19.311]  And to touch someone is an assault, but his car is rolling at about three, four miles an hour.
[00:12:20.251 --> 00:12:30.734]  She runs up in her wig and begins trying, with the open window, to shove the sign in, and her arms are hanging in the car, and Rand Paul is flailing.
[00:12:30.734 --> 00:12:36.935]  And, I mean, what do you think would happen if you ran up to Jack Conway's car?
[00:12:36.935 --> 00:12:44.978]  I would suspect if police were around, they'd grab you, throw you to the ground, and jump on top of you, because they don't know if you've got a gun or what you're planning.
[00:12:44.978 --> 00:12:46.238]  This is a highly charged,
[00:12:47.432 --> 00:12:48.713]  National situation.
[00:12:48.713 --> 00:12:57.819]  I mean, what's she gonna could someone have run up like with what happened with, you know, other famous political campaigns and things could get really nasty after that point.
[00:12:57.819 --> 00:13:02.202]  And I'm not defending the guy that puts his foot on her shoulder to hold her down.
[00:13:02.202 --> 00:13:04.463]  And then she tries to move and he puts a little more pressure.
[00:13:04.463 --> 00:13:05.764]  He did not stomp her.
[00:13:05.764 --> 00:13:10.608]  And I'm still saying that I think it was wrong what he did and was excessive.
[00:13:10.608 --> 00:13:17.012]  But we're conditioned in this public of the image of police taking somebody to the ground where they jump on their head with their knees.
[00:13:18.012 --> 00:13:23.634]  Or, you know, put their foot on your head or put their foot on your hand if you're resisting.
[00:13:23.634 --> 00:13:26.095]  And sure, in some cases it's excessive.
[00:13:26.095 --> 00:13:45.863]  But the issue here is the media move on and George Soros outfits like Huffington Post, they came out and they tried to imply that she'd done nothing and it was a lie by Rand Paul supporters that she ran up and tried to shove something in the car in his face.
[00:13:47.099 --> 00:13:48.220]  And they said it's ridiculous.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.585]  She walked up nicely to show him the sign.
[00:13:51.585 --> 00:13:53.027]  Well, that's not what happened.
[00:13:53.027 --> 00:13:59.134]  And if you're a radio listener, just get to a computer and go up to PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:13:59.134 --> 00:14:03.340]  New video shows move on activists attempting to assault Rand Paul.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:04.962]  And here's the issue.
[00:14:07.148 --> 00:14:23.516]  The media takes non-issues and hypes them up, but then when you've got Jack Conway and his brother, Matt Conway, who's a prosecutor, his brother's the Attorney General, there's a narcotics investigation of trafficking and use, they're planning to raid his house,
[00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:31.563]  And the detectives go and tell him that they're coming and tell him, get yourself clean and get yourself ready.
[00:14:31.563 --> 00:14:38.864]  Those are quotes out of the Mainline Courier Journal, a detailed report from the police reports.
[00:14:38.864 --> 00:14:39.945]  They then warn his brother.
[00:14:39.945 --> 00:14:45.186]  His brother has meetings with these people, the Attorney General, and they go ahead and have the raid on the house.
[00:14:45.186 --> 00:14:46.966]  Two days later, nothing's found.
[00:14:46.966 --> 00:14:53.688]  Then the detectives are questioned by other detectives and they admittedly, in the newspaper, they admit, this is admitted, that they lied.
[00:14:54.966 --> 00:14:56.908]  And they say, we're sorry we lied.
[00:14:56.908 --> 00:15:01.191]  We just think Matt Conway's a good guy and this wasn't true, so we warned him.
[00:15:01.191 --> 00:15:03.553]  Gee, we hope we don't lose our jobs.
[00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:07.196]  One guy says, I know I won't be in narcotics for sure now.
[00:15:07.196 --> 00:15:13.081]  And of course, Conway's brother had to resign from the county where he was the prosecutor over this.
[00:15:13.081 --> 00:15:14.723]  And that was actually last year.
[00:15:14.723 --> 00:15:23.230]  This cover-up's just coming out now in the last month because there's still a criminal investigation that's open on the detectives lying.
[00:15:24.978 --> 00:15:27.679]  Will it just be disciplinary or will they get in trouble?
[00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:30.800]  Will they actually get fired or will they be indicted?
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:41.525]  And according to my understanding of the law, and many other lawyers and police that I've talked to on-air and off-air since yesterday, that is the only move they can have is a criminal...
[00:15:42.405 --> 00:15:44.926]  Indictment of these people because they've admitted they've done it.
[00:15:44.926 --> 00:15:49.126]  So you have bonafide, real, hardcore corruption.
[00:15:49.126 --> 00:15:51.487]  We don't know about the narcotics because he got tipped off.
[00:15:51.487 --> 00:15:57.908]  But we know that they were basically aiding and abetting him to evade an ongoing investigation.
[00:15:57.908 --> 00:16:00.889]  We know that they then lied to investigators.
[00:16:00.889 --> 00:16:04.330]  We now know that they were basically colluding to do this.
[00:16:04.330 --> 00:16:07.690]  And we know that his brother, the Attorney General Jack Conway, was involved.
[00:16:07.690 --> 00:16:10.431]  Now, this came out in the Courier Journal.
[00:16:12.117 --> 00:16:20.059]  And other major publications a week ago, just a couple of newspapers, and it's never gotten any attention since.
[00:16:20.059 --> 00:16:26.961]  And that's why the mainstream media is so discredited and is losing their credibility and is falling apart.
[00:16:26.961 --> 00:16:37.984]  Because people know that a guy putting his foot on a lady is nothing compared to the Attorney General and his prosecutor brother and a bunch of detectives
[00:16:39.235 --> 00:16:41.617]  Frustrating a narcotics investigation.
[00:16:41.617 --> 00:16:43.999]  That is obstruction of justice, bare minimum.
[00:16:43.999 --> 00:16:45.961]  It's aiding and abetting, bare minimum.
[00:16:45.961 --> 00:16:48.483]  And they admit this now.
[00:16:48.483 --> 00:16:54.868]  And they admit they lied during the onset of the investigation to other police investigators.
[00:16:54.868 --> 00:16:59.511]  With the county and the state.
[00:16:59.511 --> 00:17:02.254]  So, this is very, very serious.
[00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:02.374]  And
[00:17:03.723 --> 00:17:07.745]  It's even more serious that you can't get this to become a national news story.
[00:17:07.745 --> 00:17:09.306]  We're trying right now.
[00:17:09.306 --> 00:17:20.331]  It's a very close race with Rand Paul, and after all the false accusations they've slung at Rand, after all the lies, after Conway implied that he's soft on drugs and somehow involved with drugs...
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:47.955]  and you know talked about supposing marijuana smoking thirty years ago now to know he's covering up a narcotics investigation of his brother and blocking investigations and warning him when he's the attorney general I mean this is very serious and this hypocrite needs to be defeated next week bare minimum and we need to get these articles we've written that are linked to all the mainstream news articles about it so people aren't going to be in denial about this and get it out to everyone but right now
[00:17:48.635 --> 00:17:52.718]  I'm going to play the audio for radio listeners, but the video is up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:52.718 --> 00:18:08.871]  Here is this MoveOn.org paid political mercenary, charges through a crowd of supporters, bust through the security, just as the Rand Paul supporters had said three days ago, on the eve of the last debate, bust through them.
[00:18:08.871 --> 00:18:11.253]  That's why I told Rand he shouldn't go to the debate.
[00:18:11.253 --> 00:18:14.476]  There was going to be some type of setup, and sure enough, there was.
[00:18:14.476 --> 00:18:18.099]  I would have not gone to that last debate, and I've been on record saying that, but
[00:18:19.474 --> 00:18:21.256]  Other minds prevailed in the campaign.
[00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:22.877]  They didn't listen to me and many others.
[00:18:22.877 --> 00:18:23.958]  So, fine.
[00:18:23.958 --> 00:18:27.380]  In fact, I think he ought to quit even campaigning for now and ought to hide out.
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.384]  I mean, there's no telling what they're going to do to him in the next four days.
[00:18:31.384 --> 00:18:32.545]  But whatever.
[00:18:32.545 --> 00:18:35.407]  Everybody knows more than me, so they do what they want.
[00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:39.450]  The point is, his supporters in security told the truth about her busting through.
[00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.274]  Imagine, a woman busts through, busts through security, runs up, starts cramming a
[00:18:46.563 --> 00:18:49.234]  Sign in the window of a moving car.
[00:18:49.234 --> 00:18:50.278]  Let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:18:50.278 --> 00:18:50.559]  Here it is.
[00:19:26.647 --> 00:19:27.889]  We're gonna go to break.
[00:19:27.889 --> 00:19:37.266]  So imagine, a woman in a wig busts through security, runs up to a moving car going three miles an hour, tries to cram it through the window, not once, not twice, three times.
[00:19:37.266 --> 00:19:39.069]  It's in there in Rand Paul's face.
[00:19:41.483 --> 00:19:45.487]  I mean, obviously, they thought she could have been somebody with a gun or something.
[00:19:45.487 --> 00:19:48.090]  So, I don't think it's excessive force now that you look at it.
[00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:49.592]  They didn't know what she had.
[00:19:49.592 --> 00:19:52.374]  She was acting like somebody trying to bum-rush him.
[00:19:52.374 --> 00:19:53.556]  Some kind of lunatic.
[00:19:53.556 --> 00:19:54.897]  Which was exactly what she wanted.
[00:19:54.897 --> 00:19:57.360]  When they were taking her down, she was smiling.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.161]  She thought, mission accomplished.
[00:19:59.161 --> 00:20:00.082]  They're gonna beat up a girl.
[00:20:01.178 --> 00:20:01.878]  My name is Crystal.
[00:20:01.878 --> 00:20:02.979]  I'm a 45-year-old and live in Houston, Texas.
[00:20:02.979 --> 00:20:05.481]  I was diagnosed with having mitral valve prolapse 10 years ago.
[00:20:05.481 --> 00:20:07.602]  My cardiologist said surgery and drugs was the only thing he could offer me.
[00:20:23.092 --> 00:20:23.933]  What did Crystal do?
[00:20:23.933 --> 00:20:27.878]  I ordered Heart and Body Extract in August 2006.
[00:20:27.878 --> 00:20:34.285]  When I first took my first 15 drops, I embraced the formula and could even feel the goodness of the formula starting to work.
[00:20:34.285 --> 00:20:37.849]  Clean, clear arteries are happy arteries after using Heart and Body Extract.

[00:21:30.393 --> 00:21:39.719]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:21:39.719 --> 00:21:40.520]  This capitalism?
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:46.784]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:21:46.784 --> 00:21:47.665]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:47.665 --> 00:21:50.907]  I'm placing a silver dollar in a book explains our monetary system.
[00:21:50.907 --> 00:21:51.707]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[00:21:51.707 --> 00:21:52.788]  It's time to understand the system.

[00:22:03.055 --> 00:22:05.256]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:22:05.256 --> 00:22:08.578]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:22:08.578 --> 00:22:13.681]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:22:13.681 --> 00:22:17.883]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:20.546]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:22:20.546 --> 00:22:23.429]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:22:23.429 --> 00:22:26.352]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:22:26.352 --> 00:22:33.961]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:39.568]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:22:39.568 --> 00:22:42.528]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:22:42.528 --> 00:22:46.209]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:22:46.209 --> 00:22:47.290]  And I got news for you.
[00:22:47.290 --> 00:22:48.610]  You're everyone else.
[00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:50.111]  Invisible Empire.

[00:22:59.895 --> 00:23:03.177]  Most Americans believe famine and hunger will never happen.
[00:23:03.177 --> 00:23:05.098]  But what if... Day 1.
[00:23:05.098 --> 00:23:07.519]  Mayhem breaks out at grocery stores.
[00:23:07.519 --> 00:23:08.479]  Day 3.
[00:23:08.479 --> 00:23:10.861]  Families are on edge.
[00:23:10.861 --> 00:23:11.901]  Day 5.
[00:23:11.901 --> 00:23:13.802]  The neighbors come knocking.
[00:23:13.802 --> 00:23:14.963]  Day 10.
[00:23:14.963 --> 00:23:18.264]  Small bands of thieves begin stealing at gunpoint.
[00:23:18.264 --> 00:23:19.565]  Day 15.
[00:23:19.565 --> 00:23:23.307]  Desperation, but the government can't help because there's no food left.
[00:23:25.405 --> 00:23:29.891]  Introducing the Grab and Go Emergency Food Supply from Solutions from Science.

[00:24:11.104 --> 00:24:17.631]  I haven't gotten into the economy yet.
[00:24:17.631 --> 00:24:22.596]  I haven't gotten into the military news, but it's all coming up.
[00:24:22.596 --> 00:24:24.739]  But I said I was going to take a lot of phone calls today.
[00:24:24.739 --> 00:24:28.563]  So we're going to go ahead and launch into your calls right now.
[00:24:28.563 --> 00:24:30.465]  Carolyn in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[00:24:31.462 --> 00:24:32.382]  Hi Alex.
[00:24:32.382 --> 00:24:32.602]  Welcome.
[00:24:32.602 --> 00:24:33.503]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[00:24:33.503 --> 00:24:36.864]  I wanted to talk to you about something that's really upsetting me.
[00:24:36.864 --> 00:24:38.084]  I went to work the other day.
[00:24:38.084 --> 00:24:40.885]  I work at a small Northeast Tennessee hospital.
[00:24:40.885 --> 00:24:42.046]  I'm a nurse.
[00:24:42.046 --> 00:24:46.927]  And they were telling us that we have to take, it's mandatory to take the flu shot.
[00:24:46.927 --> 00:24:51.249]  And I said, no, there is no law saying that we have to take the flu shot.
[00:24:51.249 --> 00:24:57.511]  And they said they've written it into their employee handbook that you have to take the shot.
[00:24:57.511 --> 00:24:59.712]  And as an afterthought, they say, well,
[00:25:00.646 --> 00:25:06.015]  You can have an allergic or a religious out on it.
[00:25:06.618 --> 00:25:10.100]  But if you don't take the flu shot, you have to wear a mask.
[00:25:37.059 --> 00:25:50.975]  Uh, and so, uh, this is the intimidation going on with basically people involved in the infrastructure, uh, in, in hospitals, in government, uh, police, fire folks, uh, and it's just, it's terrible.
[00:25:50.975 --> 00:25:55.561]  They are attempting to force it on you, but notice, just like with public schools,
[00:25:56.181 --> 00:25:56.702]  I don't know.
[00:26:14.165 --> 00:26:14.685]  I don't
[00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:32.310]  I
[00:26:47.552 --> 00:26:48.052]  I don't think so.
[00:27:17.369 --> 00:27:23.717]  Yeah, this one drives me crazy because I'm telling people stuff and I'm printing a bunch of junk off from Mike Adams' site.
[00:27:23.717 --> 00:27:28.983]  He wrote so many good articles and in fact, the mask doesn't work.
[00:27:28.983 --> 00:27:31.767]  It doesn't even protect you against the flu virus.
[00:27:31.767 --> 00:27:33.509]  He had a great article on that.
[00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:41.276]  The government admits that the flu virus is so small that no mask, unless it's a full respirator over your whole face, stops it.
[00:27:41.276 --> 00:27:42.998]  Or the virus just goes into your eyes.
[00:27:42.998 --> 00:27:45.160]  But let's stop there.
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:50.525]  If we search right now on the search engine, study H1N1 vaccine
[00:27:55.353 --> 00:27:58.215]  Exactly, and all we need is to go out and get some sunshine.
[00:28:18.237 --> 00:28:20.037]  Well, that is the vitamin D. Exactly.
[00:28:20.037 --> 00:28:24.458]  There's no silver bullet, but sunshine is the absolute, total key.
[00:28:24.458 --> 00:28:25.858]  I appreciate your call.
[00:28:25.858 --> 00:28:28.299]  Also getting a lot of other vitamins.
[00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:30.339]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jonathan in Kansas.
[00:28:30.339 --> 00:28:32.539]  Jonathan, you're on the air.
[00:28:32.539 --> 00:28:34.300]  Hey, Alex.
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:34.680]  Yes, sir.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.680]  I have some videos for you.
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.780]  Okay.
[00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:43.161]  I have one of Harry Reid, basically foot propping.
[00:28:43.161 --> 00:28:46.802]  Basically, this is an old video.
[00:28:46.802 --> 00:28:47.502]  Let's see.
[00:28:50.017 --> 00:28:56.300]  Well, I can actually, I'll get back to that, but there's one on YouTube.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:59.642]  Well, just remember, Jonathan, a lot of people don't know who you're talking about.
[00:28:59.642 --> 00:29:11.228]  Terry Reid was a CIA contractor at MENA with Bill Clinton and others when they were shipping in the cocaine, and he wrote Compromise, Clinton, Bush, and the CIA, and I interviewed him.
[00:29:11.228 --> 00:29:16.451]  He's in my film, Police State 2, The Takeover, and he talks about government narcotics trafficking.
[00:29:16.451 --> 00:29:18.532]  I met Harry Reid, the senator.
[00:29:20.746 --> 00:29:33.542]  Uh, basically, well, Henry, Harry Reid was basically saying that, uh, that he, he opposed, uh, birth, birthright citizenship and basically it's on YouTube right now.
[00:29:33.953 --> 00:29:36.554]  Well, of course he's always flip-flopping.
[00:29:36.554 --> 00:29:37.134]  But stay there.
[00:29:37.134 --> 00:29:40.856]  I want you to be able to finish your point, Jonathan, when we come back on the other side.
[00:29:40.856 --> 00:29:47.099]  Then we're going to talk to Andre, Perry, Chris, and others.
[00:29:47.099 --> 00:29:48.540]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:52.841]  What's your take on all this election fraud that's admittedly... We're on the march.
[00:29:52.841 --> 00:29:55.383]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.383 --> 00:29:58.044]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.035 --> 00:30:05.598]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar-powered generator.
[00:30:05.598 --> 00:30:06.499]  Number one.
[00:30:06.499 --> 00:30:09.921]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.921 --> 00:30:10.802]  Number two.
[00:30:10.802 --> 00:30:15.685]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.685 --> 00:30:16.425]  It's true.
[00:30:16.425 --> 00:30:21.289]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:21.289 --> 00:30:22.129]  Number three.
[00:30:22.129 --> 00:30:25.711]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.711 --> 00:30:29.414]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.614 --> 00:30:30.414]  Number four.
[00:30:30.414 --> 00:30:33.175]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:33.175 --> 00:30:36.836]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.836 --> 00:30:37.636]  Number five.
[00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:41.777]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.777 --> 00:30:46.839]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:51.020]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:30:58.663 --> 00:31:02.587]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.

[00:31:54.299 --> 00:31:54.719]  Thank you!
[00:32:01.883 --> 00:32:05.907]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:32:05.907 --> 00:32:09.151]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:32:09.151 --> 00:32:13.936]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:32:13.936 --> 00:32:20.343]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:32:20.343 --> 00:32:22.586]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:32:23.106 --> 00:32:23.406]  Tim Geithner?
[00:32:23.406 --> 00:32:23.926]  Bernanke?
[00:32:23.926 --> 00:32:24.607]  They're arsonists!
[00:32:24.607 --> 00:32:25.867]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:32:25.867 --> 00:32:28.128]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:32:42.014 --> 00:32:44.155]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:32:44.155 --> 00:32:49.296]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:32:49.296 --> 00:33:03.840]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:08.801]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:33:08.801 --> 00:33:10.102]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:12.208 --> 00:33:14.290]  Okay, I'm going to take 20, 30, 40 phone calls.
[00:33:14.290 --> 00:33:15.912]  I'm going to give each caller one minute.
[00:33:15.912 --> 00:33:32.747]  I'm going to try to not give you long-winded answers so we can get to the next person on the election, the economy, all of the electronic voting machine fraud coming out all over the nation, mainstream headlines like, you know, democratic voter fraud, pandemic.
[00:33:32.747 --> 00:33:34.369]  I mean, it is just everywhere.
[00:33:35.069 --> 00:33:38.252]  It is out of control and the system is scared.
[00:33:38.252 --> 00:33:47.581]  It came out last week that there are big memos inside the mainline Republican Party about how the RINOs plan on taking control of this Patriot Revolution.
[00:33:47.581 --> 00:33:50.204]  So we're being attacked from two different angles.
[00:33:50.204 --> 00:33:52.846]  But the big enemy is the establishment Democrats.
[00:33:53.407 --> 00:33:57.569]  Who openly support Obamacare, the open borders and all the rest of it.
[00:33:57.569 --> 00:34:01.150]  We need to take over the Republican Party and the Democratic Party.
[00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:06.833]  And you see a lot of Democrats coming out and saying they're against Obamacare, they're against open borders.
[00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:09.454]  Really starting to flip-flop.
[00:34:10.054 --> 00:34:12.195]  And they're doing that because they're desperate.
[00:34:12.195 --> 00:34:19.400]  And I've seen Democratic Party strategists on television praising this, saying they're doing what they have to to win.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.302]  Don't worry, they're lying to people.
[00:34:21.302 --> 00:34:25.925]  Well, if they are lying, once they get into office, we'll have them on record and we'll know.
[00:34:26.525 --> 00:34:29.969]  This process of throwing the bums out has just begun.
[00:34:29.969 --> 00:34:32.532]  This is a major political realignment.
[00:34:32.532 --> 00:34:34.835]  This is not business as usual.
[00:34:34.835 --> 00:34:37.498]  And we're not going to extricate ourselves from this mess overnight.
[00:34:37.498 --> 00:34:38.379]  It's going to take time.
[00:34:38.379 --> 00:34:42.303]  Now, Jonathan, you're talking about Harry Reid, the head senator.
[00:34:43.968 --> 00:34:55.452]  From Nevada, in deep trouble, way behind in the polls, but magically, in the most populous county, magically the voting machines, according to mainstream news we covered yesterday, are flipping the votes.
[00:34:55.452 --> 00:34:57.593]  You can't vote for Sharon Engel there.
[00:34:57.593 --> 00:35:04.435]  But you were talking about a video, I haven't seen this, of saying he now opposes birthright anchor baby status?
[00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:08.357]  No, he did not now oppose it, but in 1993 he did.
[00:35:08.357 --> 00:35:11.538]  Type into YouTube, hypocrite Harry Reid.
[00:35:12.065 --> 00:35:13.386]  Well, Jonathan, I appreciate your call.
[00:35:13.386 --> 00:35:15.567]  Hypocrite Harry Reid, we'll YouTube it right now.
[00:35:32.429 --> 00:35:36.170]  Mexico shoots illegals that come into their country and I think that's wrong.
[00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:38.171]  Other Latin Americans.
[00:35:38.171 --> 00:35:42.752]  Mexico is one of the most corrupt, oppressive, draconian nations on earth.
[00:35:42.752 --> 00:35:49.794]  No country allows just unlimited illegal immigration and then allows their children to become citizens and gives them welfare.
[00:35:49.794 --> 00:35:53.115]  The globalists want to do this to bankrupt the country.
[00:35:53.115 --> 00:36:01.838]  Remember, the bankers like the debt to go up because they basically create this money out of nothing but then gain the whole world through the fraud.
[00:36:02.921 --> 00:36:07.545]  And I know that all of you understand that, but we have to get that message out to the general public.
[00:36:07.545 --> 00:36:18.514]  It doesn't matter what color you are, this country is going to Hades in a handbasket if we do not do something about the open borders now.
[00:36:18.514 --> 00:36:21.796]  The globalists are for open borders, hence, I'm against it.
[00:36:21.796 --> 00:36:24.558]  Andre in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:36:24.558 --> 00:36:25.559]  Yeah, how you doing Alex?
[00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:27.561]  I'm a long time listener, first time caller.
[00:36:27.561 --> 00:36:27.901]  Welcome.
[00:36:27.901 --> 00:36:29.722]  I was wondering, thank you.
[00:36:29.722 --> 00:36:31.384]  Yeah, I was wondering like, you know, if
[00:36:32.486 --> 00:36:35.908]  You know, we could do anti-trust legislation to break up some of these big companies.
[00:36:35.908 --> 00:36:40.130]  Wouldn't that do something to alleviate the unemployment?
[00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:43.672]  Wouldn't it get rid of LECA?
[00:36:43.672 --> 00:36:44.932]  Go ahead.
[00:36:44.932 --> 00:36:48.714]  No, I was gonna say, wouldn't that, wouldn't we, you know, has what, 8 million people who are unemployed?
[00:36:48.714 --> 00:36:55.398]  Wouldn't we, if we broke up companies like Time Warner and Bank of America, wouldn't that do something to create, you know, create jobs for people?
[00:36:56.824 --> 00:37:03.331]  It probably would, but the first companies that need to be broken up aren't Time Warner.
[00:37:03.331 --> 00:37:06.154]  It's things like JPMorgan Chase.
[00:37:06.154 --> 00:37:08.236]  It's companies like Bank of America.
[00:37:08.236 --> 00:37:10.358]  It's companies like Goldman Sachs.
[00:37:10.358 --> 00:37:12.661]  That's the top of the pyramid.
[00:37:12.661 --> 00:37:17.866]  Actually, companies like Time Warner, though I don't like them and they're globalist, actually hire a lot of people.
[00:37:18.835 --> 00:37:27.858]  I mean, the big oligopolies and cartels that we have are the insurance companies and the big banks.
[00:37:27.858 --> 00:37:29.258]  But that's a very good point, Andre.
[00:37:29.258 --> 00:37:30.898]  Anything else?
[00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:42.122]  Yeah, I was saying that they have a lot of influence based on the fact that they own so many subsidiaries, they have so much control of media, it's hard to get different opinions out to the public.
[00:37:44.045 --> 00:37:45.346]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:37:45.346 --> 00:37:51.368]  And speaking of another issue, and I appreciate your call, I was just looking at one of the headlines on Infowars.com.
[00:37:51.368 --> 00:37:58.891]  Sharon Engel's top campaign lawyer has given a press conference openly saying, Reed intends to steal this election.
[00:37:58.891 --> 00:37:59.951]  And I agree.
[00:37:59.951 --> 00:38:02.512]  We are seeing fraud right out in the open.
[00:38:02.512 --> 00:38:03.293]  This is amazing.
[00:38:04.173 --> 00:38:07.134]  In fact, guys, I didn't see that in my stack.
[00:38:07.134 --> 00:38:08.614]  Will you print that for me?
[00:38:08.614 --> 00:38:08.934]  Thank you.
[00:38:08.934 --> 00:38:11.535]  It's one of the tiles on Infowars.com.
[00:38:11.535 --> 00:38:11.855]  Thank you.
[00:38:11.855 --> 00:38:14.635]  There's also a video that accompanies it.
[00:38:14.635 --> 00:38:14.995]  There it is.
[00:38:14.995 --> 00:38:17.716]  Las Vegas Sun.
[00:38:17.716 --> 00:38:20.477]  Angle campaign attorney.
[00:38:20.477 --> 00:38:25.098]  Reid intends to steal this election if he can't win it outright.
[00:38:25.098 --> 00:38:27.358]  Let's go ahead and talk to Perry in Arizona.
[00:38:27.358 --> 00:38:28.278]  Perry, you're on the air.
[00:38:28.278 --> 00:38:29.599]  Hey there.
[00:38:29.599 --> 00:38:30.139]  How's it going?
[00:38:30.139 --> 00:38:30.359]  Good.
[00:38:32.071 --> 00:38:35.572]  Just a few points, I'll go as fast as I can.
[00:38:35.572 --> 00:38:46.536]  Last year, a couple days before Halloween, I'm in the Phoenix metro area, and the sky was absolutely pinstriped with the chemtrails.
[00:38:46.536 --> 00:38:52.558]  And it was a few days before, so how long does it take for that stuff to get down
[00:38:54.028 --> 00:39:17.563]  on the ground for our little toddlers to go trick-or-treating and they're kicking it up and they're lower you know and they're breathing all that aluminum in and things like that so just for people to pay attention a couple days before Halloween to see if those stripes are going to be doing that to our kids again and then I suggest to have Matt suit for a Halloween costume then if that's the case of course.
[00:39:18.752 --> 00:39:23.434]  But, uh, you know, uh, I saw that, uh, what in the world are they spraying?
[00:39:23.434 --> 00:39:30.238]  And, um, you know, the pilots can't keep flying the same missions over and over again, you would think.
[00:39:30.238 --> 00:39:34.360]  You know, they would be affected with that aluminum, too.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:38.141]  So, do they transfer them a few days before they fall ill and die?
[00:39:38.141 --> 00:39:44.204]  Or, you know, who's flying these planes is what I, the question that I have through watching that film.
[00:39:44.204 --> 00:39:45.425]  And I think the bailout must
[00:39:46.224 --> 00:39:50.046]  Is where the money has come from for all this aluminum.
[00:39:50.046 --> 00:39:50.926]  I don't know if that's true.
[00:39:50.926 --> 00:39:52.247]  I have no basis for it.
[00:39:52.247 --> 00:39:54.228]  Well, Perry, I appreciate your call.
[00:39:54.228 --> 00:40:06.995]  For those that don't know, we're carrying the film, What in the World Are They Spraying?, dealing with the admissions of a giant, secretive geoengineering campaign that's been going on for at least 16, 17 years.
[00:40:06.995 --> 00:40:12.117]  They kept most of it classified in the last two years, and this stuff doesn't kill you overnight.
[00:40:12.117 --> 00:40:13.018]  It builds up
[00:40:13.678 --> 00:40:16.059]  And bioaccumulates in the body.
[00:40:16.059 --> 00:40:22.023]  And that's why you're seeing degenerative diseases of the brain, now striking more and more young people.
[00:40:22.023 --> 00:40:24.204]  It's just epidemic levels.
[00:40:24.204 --> 00:40:26.005]  It's part of a larger program.
[00:40:26.005 --> 00:40:28.366]  And there's a lot of different programs that are going on in tandem.
[00:40:28.366 --> 00:40:34.649]  But if folks want to get the DVD, What in the World Are They Spraying?, it's available at Infowars.com.
[00:40:34.649 --> 00:40:38.972]  And I suggest you also see my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[00:40:38.972 --> 00:40:40.753]  You can also call toll free to get the film, 888.
[00:40:41.753 --> 00:40:42.313]  Hi Alex.
[00:40:42.313 --> 00:40:43.634]  You're incredible.
[00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:47.475]  I keep looking for intellectual compromise on your part, but I can't find any.
[00:40:47.475 --> 00:40:48.055]  You're incredible.
[00:40:48.055 --> 00:40:51.456]  Listen, about a couple of things I'd like to ask, but I may not get time.
[00:41:08.439 --> 00:41:17.002]  I do, I am concerned about something that I feel that you're missing on the Obamacare subject.
[00:41:17.002 --> 00:41:22.024]  And I feel like you've covered, you know, the insurance, the scam, that it all is fairly well.
[00:41:22.024 --> 00:41:31.227]  But Nancy Lord was Ron Paul's running mate, I believe in 1988, as vice presidential candidate.
[00:41:31.227 --> 00:41:35.829]  And I heard her say one time at a table some years after that election,
[00:41:36.886 --> 00:41:46.349]  She slandered the glass down on the table and said, the American Medical Association is a criminal racket.
[00:41:46.349 --> 00:41:52.110]  She is a medical doctor and a bar-sanctioned attorney.
[00:41:52.110 --> 00:42:05.254]  I am kind of wondering why I've never heard the phrase American Medical Establishment discussed on your show when you're talking about the inside workings of them.
[00:42:07.057 --> 00:42:14.560]  Uh, who you've had on there before, uh, has a whole history of the American Medical Association and, um... Sure.
[00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:17.180]  Hey, hey, hey, Chris, uh, listen.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:25.843]  I don't know how often you listen to the show, but we talk about the American Medical Association being on the payroll of the Rockefeller Foundation and others constantly.
[00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:33.746]  Uh, we talk about how the average doctor means well and is compartmentalized and doesn't see the big picture, uh, and we just endlessly
[00:42:35.049 --> 00:42:35.470]  I don't think so.
[00:42:44.304 --> 00:42:44.704]  I don't know.
[00:43:08.574 --> 00:43:10.075]  Who cares who I am?
[00:43:10.075 --> 00:43:11.676]  I mean, who cares?
[00:43:11.676 --> 00:43:18.501]  I mean, I know I'm a good person, but what does that have to do with what we're all going to do against this corruption?
[00:43:18.501 --> 00:43:23.385]  I mean, I'll be honest with you folks, I'm exhausted today.
[00:43:23.385 --> 00:43:27.027]  Every second of this radio show is hell right now for me.
[00:43:27.027 --> 00:43:32.851]  It's not like that most days, but every once in a while, you know, I get really tired.
[00:43:32.851 --> 00:43:36.474]  I probably only had eight, nine hours sleep in the three days I was in California.
[00:43:38.158 --> 00:43:46.641]  And I'm very tired, and I'm here taking your phone calls covering the news.
[00:43:46.641 --> 00:43:51.322]  I mean, if I talk about a subsection of a bill, you can go check it out.
[00:43:51.322 --> 00:43:52.442]  It's up to you to go look it up.
[00:43:52.442 --> 00:44:03.946]  If I talk about Jack Conway, the Attorney General, covering up for his brother, and the detectives warning him, and the detectives admitting that he lied, and the fact that this is obstruction of justice, I mean, you can go read mainstream news articles we're linked to.
[00:44:05.257 --> 00:44:10.018]  If I talk about mortgage fraud and corruption, you know, we have experts on about it.
[00:44:10.018 --> 00:44:16.419]  I mean, here's an example of the type of stuff we cover.
[00:44:16.419 --> 00:44:17.439]  Okay?
[00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:22.460]  Research proves gender-bending chemicals affect reproduction.
[00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:29.301]  And it gets into Bisphenol A. This is by University of Exeter.
[00:44:29.301 --> 00:44:29.601]  Okay?
[00:44:29.601 --> 00:44:33.662]  And it says, research proves gender-bending chemicals affect reproduction.
[00:44:36.178 --> 00:44:48.710]  And then the University Report goes on to add to all the other big stacks of reports and medical studies that bisphenol A feminizes boys and hyperfeminizes girls.
[00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:51.052]  It makes girls go into puberty early.
[00:44:51.052 --> 00:44:53.574]  It makes boys go into it late and be feminized.
[00:44:54.321 --> 00:45:14.895]  And they've done studies on frogs, on alligators, but also on mammals, on guinea pigs and rats, and I put a video out explaining that one reason men are feminized and get confused sexually, I'm not saying in every case, that's not the only reason, you know, I'm not even, when I cover this, I'm not even making a moral judgment.
[00:45:14.895 --> 00:45:17.237]  I'm just stating what the research shows.
[00:45:19.878 --> 00:45:27.624]  These chemicals in amphibians actually make them have both sexual organs.
[00:45:27.624 --> 00:45:38.252]  And then they, literally it had to be 75 or more articles a month ago demonizing yours truly for making, you know, these joke headlines.
[00:45:38.252 --> 00:45:42.075]  Alex Jones says juice boxes make you gay.
[00:45:42.075 --> 00:45:46.898]  No, I warned parents and said Bisphenol A lines most juice boxes.
[00:45:48.035 --> 00:46:00.818]  And it will hurt your girls and hurt your boys, and then I read studies about it, and then it all becomes Alex Jones is a kook, Alex Jones is a nut, Alex Jones says juice boxes make you gay.
[00:46:00.818 --> 00:46:13.621]  All I did was read university reports about it giving women breast cancer, leading to men having testicular cancer, lowering men's normal testosterone, upping women's estrogen.
[00:46:14.554 --> 00:46:21.559]  But instead of all those people addressing something that's hurting them and their own families, it's just easier to make a joke about Alex Jones.
[00:46:21.559 --> 00:46:23.221]  So I don't care.
[00:46:23.221 --> 00:46:24.782]  That's fine.
[00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:35.110]  But it's like an imprinted thing in America that if anybody sticks their head up to warn anybody, well, let's judge them.
[00:46:35.110 --> 00:46:40.454]  And it's just frustrating because all we talk about is how the American Medical Association is corrupt.
[00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:45.912]  I mean, you must have never listened to the show to make a statement like that, but whatever.
[00:46:45.912 --> 00:46:48.032]  I mean, you got to call in and talk about it.
[00:46:48.032 --> 00:46:50.393]  And again, it's not that I don't like being criticized.
[00:46:50.393 --> 00:46:51.653]  I could care less.
[00:46:51.653 --> 00:46:52.934]  It's that I just don't get it.
[00:46:52.934 --> 00:46:56.995]  I mean, I just don't even understand it.
[00:46:56.995 --> 00:46:59.075]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kathy in Michigan.
[00:46:59.075 --> 00:47:00.876]  Kathy, you're on the air.
[00:47:00.876 --> 00:47:02.276]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:47:02.276 --> 00:47:03.457]  Hi.
[00:47:03.457 --> 00:47:04.157]  Hi.
[00:47:04.157 --> 00:47:07.218]  I'm a longtime listener and a first-time caller.
[00:47:08.385 --> 00:47:13.330]  And I have a little thing here that I received and what you just said, that's so true.
[00:47:13.330 --> 00:47:18.675]  Because people, you know, we know who's putting the kibosh on what you're saying and twisting the words.
[00:47:18.675 --> 00:47:23.620]  So, you know, that's just a given and you don't even need to waste your time talking about it.
[00:47:25.595 --> 00:47:27.355]  I have this thing that we received in the mail.
[00:47:27.355 --> 00:47:40.858]  We filled out the short form census, and then all of a sudden we get this thing in the mail, and they want us to fill out the American Community Survey put out by the U.S.
[00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:41.638]  Census Bureau.
[00:47:41.638 --> 00:47:43.379]  And it's got 40-something questions.
[00:47:43.379 --> 00:47:44.759]  What type of toilet do you have?
[00:47:44.759 --> 00:47:45.979]  Do you own guns?
[00:47:45.979 --> 00:47:47.640]  There's different variants of it.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:54.541]  And under the Fifth Amendment, you don't have to fill it out, but let me guess, it's got a little note on it threatening you with criminal penalties if you don't.
[00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:56.391]  Yeah, Title 13 U.S.
[00:47:56.391 --> 00:47:57.412]  Code Section 141.
[00:47:57.412 --> 00:47:58.632]  All lies!
[00:47:58.632 --> 00:47:59.353]  All lies!
[00:47:59.353 --> 00:48:04.757]  It's been thrown out in federal court in 2000, thrown out in federal court this year.
[00:48:04.757 --> 00:48:08.439]  It's complete and total lies, and no one's been prosecuted for it.
[00:48:08.439 --> 00:48:09.760]  Just all lies.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:10.440]  It's not real.
[00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:16.645]  It threatens you and imposes a penalty for not answering the questions, but some of the questions are so
[00:48:18.194 --> 00:48:22.576]  Are you in emotional condition or you have difficulty concentrating?
[00:48:22.576 --> 00:48:25.137]  What does that have to do with how many people are in the country?
[00:48:25.137 --> 00:48:27.297]  Well, that's so they can send CPS to your house.
[00:48:27.297 --> 00:48:28.898]  Oh, we show you have children.
[00:48:28.898 --> 00:48:30.158]  You're having emotional problems.
[00:48:30.158 --> 00:48:32.319]  CPS is here to take your children.
[00:48:32.319 --> 00:48:35.560]  Number one, ma'am, you pointed out you already filled out the census.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.781]  How many people live there?
[00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:39.121]  That's the law every 10 years.
[00:48:39.121 --> 00:48:40.302]  It goes back to Leviticus.
[00:48:40.982 --> 00:48:47.907]  Okay, it's for congressional appropriation, it's for how many members of the House of Representatives your state gets.
[00:48:47.907 --> 00:48:49.808]  Okay, so now you get another one.
[00:48:49.808 --> 00:48:52.169]  Let me tell you what the census has announced they're going to do.
[00:48:52.169 --> 00:49:00.315]  They want to phase in monthly census forms for all Americans, and just like they try to train you to go into naked body scanners to see if they can get away with it,
[00:49:01.175 --> 00:49:04.517]  Or they try to give you forced inoculations to see if they can get away with it.
[00:49:04.517 --> 00:49:08.499]  Or they try to take your house when it's paid for to see if they can get away with it.
[00:49:08.499 --> 00:49:12.380]  Or the Federal Reserve steals tens of trillions to see if they can get away with it.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:18.684]  And Jack Conway obstructs a narcotics investigation of his brother to see if he can get away with it.
[00:49:18.684 --> 00:49:21.325]  They just see what they can get away with.
[00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:22.785]  And I didn't fill anything out.
[00:49:22.785 --> 00:49:24.286]  Let me tell you what I did with the census.
[00:49:24.286 --> 00:49:25.447]  I didn't fill anything out.
[00:49:26.187 --> 00:49:35.374]  I didn't tell them how many live there, because it was attached to a fraudulent document threatening me with jail if I didn't tell them my emotional state.
[00:49:35.374 --> 00:49:42.439]  So because they added the lawful questions in with criminal questions, the entire document's a stinking fraud.
[00:49:42.439 --> 00:49:44.040]  Okay, so here I am.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:46.222]  I haven't vaccinated any of my children.
[00:49:46.222 --> 00:49:47.382]  Okay?
[00:49:47.382 --> 00:49:49.124]  I haven't filled out any of the census forms.
[00:49:50.043 --> 00:49:51.084]  I filter my water.
[00:49:51.084 --> 00:49:52.665]  I don't drink fluoride water.
[00:49:52.665 --> 00:49:55.126]  You don't like it scumbag government?
[00:49:55.126 --> 00:49:56.087]  You know what you can do.
[00:49:56.087 --> 00:49:58.708]  Sorry, go ahead, ma'am.
[00:49:58.708 --> 00:50:02.590]  Well, that's what I wanted to know if you heard of that second survey.
[00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:04.772]  Of course!
[00:50:04.772 --> 00:50:07.793]  And listen, if you fill it out, they'll go, we got a chump.
[00:50:07.793 --> 00:50:12.836]  Then you'll start getting a yearly and then a monthly one.
[00:50:12.836 --> 00:50:18.640]  They are training everyone to constantly answer scumbag government questions.
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:19.040]  Sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.072]  That's all right.
[00:50:21.072 --> 00:50:28.063]  I just wanted to bring it to, you know, attention of the public that there's more to the census than just the census.
[00:50:28.063 --> 00:50:32.910]  Now they're sending... Some households, including yours, will receive this.
[00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:33.771]  But I know why.
[00:50:33.771 --> 00:50:35.374]  Because of who we listen to, you know?
[00:50:36.522 --> 00:50:38.462]  Well, they're sending it out all over the place.
[00:50:38.462 --> 00:50:40.643]  But, ma'am, I appreciate your call.
[00:50:40.643 --> 00:50:43.064]  Look, you make your own decision about it.
[00:50:43.064 --> 00:50:45.404]  But, you know, you fill out one, here comes another.
[00:50:45.404 --> 00:50:46.685]  Now fill this out.
[00:50:46.685 --> 00:50:50.325]  Yeah, pretty soon they're at your door saying, hey, come over to my house and mow my lawn.
[00:50:50.325 --> 00:50:50.926]  I'm the government.
[00:50:50.926 --> 00:50:51.426]  You know what?
[00:50:51.426 --> 00:50:52.246]  Lick my boots.
[00:50:52.246 --> 00:50:53.686]  You know, I'm the government.
[00:50:53.686 --> 00:50:54.747]  I make the sun come up.
[00:50:54.747 --> 00:50:55.727]  I make the grass grow.
[00:50:55.727 --> 00:50:56.547]  I'm the government.
[00:50:56.547 --> 00:50:59.468]  What would we do without the scumbag government working for foreign bankers?
[00:50:59.468 --> 00:51:00.308]  More calls straight ahead.

[00:54:18.891 --> 00:54:22.092]  I'm going to get to that in a moment.
[00:54:22.092 --> 00:54:27.553]  But I meant to get into this yesterday and later I'll

[00:54:30.652 --> 00:54:33.173]  I don't want to go back to your phone calls.
[00:54:33.173 --> 00:54:36.554]  But we flew out of California from our visit to Santa Cruz.
[00:54:36.554 --> 00:54:39.115]  We flew into San Francisco.
[00:54:39.115 --> 00:54:46.438]  And the lady at the rent car place was interrogating everybody for Homeland Security.
[00:54:46.438 --> 00:54:56.982]  And then when we flew out in San Jose, they had naked body scanners in the security checkpoints.
[00:54:58.425 --> 00:55:02.917]  And I sat there because Aaron had to unpack the cameras and stuff and then repack them to go through.
[00:55:02.917 --> 00:55:06.667]  That took about 10 minutes and we got coffee and sat there for another 10 minutes.
[00:55:07.662 --> 00:55:11.904]  Right in front of the checkpoint, watching who they ran through the naked body scanners.
[00:55:11.904 --> 00:55:14.986]  I did not see one man run through it.
[00:55:14.986 --> 00:55:16.727]  All I saw was women.
[00:55:16.727 --> 00:55:21.830]  And I'm sure that's because they've had such a rebellion against it, that's admitted, that they know women are more pliant.
[00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:25.552]  And I watched the women put their hands up and go in circles and be scanned.
[00:55:25.552 --> 00:55:30.175]  It was the type where they stand between two machines and it beams them with the radiation.
[00:55:30.175 --> 00:55:34.277]  And then I watched children, five, six, seven years old, put through it.
[00:55:37.037 --> 00:55:38.598]  And it violates U.S.
[00:55:38.598 --> 00:55:42.301]  child porn laws, British child porn laws, that's mainstream news.
[00:55:42.301 --> 00:55:59.475]  But it's one thing, as I always say, to intellectually know what these scanners are doing, but to sit there and to watch it, and to know the government stages the terror attacks, to know it's all part of training us to do anything they tell us, it was very painful.
[00:56:01.684 --> 00:56:11.350]  And I had some TSA people walk over where I was sitting at a coffee place right to the checkpoint while I sat there on a bench, bugging their eyes out at me, like, why are you looking at this?
[00:56:11.350 --> 00:56:12.491]  And I just didn't care.
[00:56:12.491 --> 00:56:14.312]  And they went away.
[00:56:14.312 --> 00:56:17.273]  I'm not supposed to watch them scanning the women.
[00:56:17.273 --> 00:56:22.096]  And the women would pliantly smile and grovel and do whatever they're told.
[00:56:22.096 --> 00:56:24.498]  I mean, this this country is just in so much trouble.
[00:56:29.312 --> 00:56:31.794]  And you're never putting my children through them, ever.
[00:56:31.794 --> 00:56:33.475]  I'm not going to submit.
[00:56:33.475 --> 00:56:38.839]  I don't travel now on the airlines with my family because I'm not going to give you the chance to have your way with them.
[00:56:38.839 --> 00:56:40.761]  And the government says, that's fine, Mr. Jones.
[00:56:40.761 --> 00:56:44.143]  We're putting them in all the state and federal courthouses, mobile vans.
[00:56:44.143 --> 00:56:45.544]  They're going to go in malls.
[00:56:45.544 --> 00:56:48.186]  They're announcing, we're going to make you bathe in radiation.
[00:56:48.186 --> 00:56:49.827]  We're going to record your naked body.
[00:56:49.827 --> 00:56:51.348]  We don't care what you say.
[00:56:51.348 --> 00:56:54.571]  And we're going to go on staging terror attacks and blaming it on the American people.
[00:56:54.571 --> 00:56:57.052]  You know, that's the message.
[00:56:58.232 --> 00:57:01.875]  And it's just going to get worse from here on out if we don't stand up and say no.
[00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:03.456]  Here's Harry Reid.
[00:57:03.456 --> 00:57:07.779]  Now he's all for anchor babies and open borders and amnesty, but here he is in 1993.
[00:57:07.779 --> 00:57:10.581]  Here it is.
[00:57:10.581 --> 00:57:19.107]  If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant?
[00:57:19.107 --> 00:57:21.289]  No sane country would do that, right?
[00:57:22.318 --> 00:57:23.699]  Guess again.
[00:57:23.699 --> 00:57:31.742]  If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S.
[00:57:31.742 --> 00:57:38.585]  citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides.
[00:57:38.585 --> 00:57:41.366]  And that's a lot of services.
[00:57:41.366 --> 00:57:51.790]  Is it any wonder that two-thirds of the babies born at taxpayer expense at county-run hospitals in Los Angeles are born to illegal alien mothers?
[00:57:53.726 --> 00:57:58.690]  And if you say that today, Harry Reid says you're a racist.
[00:57:58.690 --> 00:58:06.696]  But there he was, 1993, a new senator, and that's how he got elected, was talking like that.
[00:58:06.696 --> 00:58:13.821]  But once he got in, he's going along with the globalist plan to bring down this country.
[00:58:13.821 --> 00:58:17.644]  We are in a fight for the hearts and minds of the American people right now.
[00:58:17.644 --> 00:58:20.787]  They're ready to be awakened like they've never been before.
[00:58:22.597 --> 00:58:29.278]  And it's up to us to continue to expose these creatures and to reveal their hypocrisy.
[00:58:29.278 --> 00:58:30.739]  And we're doing a great job of it.
[00:58:30.739 --> 00:58:32.499]  You're doing a great job of it.
[00:58:32.499 --> 00:58:37.500]  That's why they're moving to start shutting down the internet and free speech as we know it.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:39.340]  But I believe we're going to defeat these criminals.
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:39.880]  Stay with us.

[00:59:44.231 --> 00:59:45.432]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.953 --> 01:00:10.776]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.776 --> 01:00:12.377]  You want answers?
[01:00:12.377 --> 01:00:13.919]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.919 --> 01:00:18.101]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:18.101 --> 01:00:22.224]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:36.582]  Alright, I'm going to take a bunch of your phone calls in the next 30 minutes.
[01:00:36.582 --> 01:00:43.568]  Then we have a lawyer joining us, whose law firm has successfully been defeating the big mortgage companies.
[01:00:43.568 --> 01:00:50.373]  It's in a Wall Street Journal article, niche lawyers spawned housing fracas, and we'll continue with open phones throughout.
[01:00:50.993 --> 01:00:52.274]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:00:52.274 --> 01:00:55.175]  I'm a Prison Planet TV member and I think it's great.
[01:00:55.175 --> 01:00:55.435]  I love it.
[01:01:14.751 --> 01:01:22.112]  And, um, I just want to let you know that, uh, remember a few weeks back when the CPS came and, uh, stole the, uh, Irish baby?
[01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:29.614]  That, uh, made me so mad, I went to, um, uh, oathkeepers.org and signed up to join that organization.
[01:01:29.614 --> 01:01:31.734]  It just really made me mad.
[01:01:31.734 --> 01:01:33.594]  Um, I got a question for ya.
[01:01:33.594 --> 01:01:38.755]  You know, we got, you're talking about this, uh, possible internet censorship coming up.
[01:01:38.755 --> 01:01:43.136]  What is to stop, like, Google right now from, when you type in a search term,
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.903]  And maybe them feeding you back bogus information or something.
[01:01:47.903 --> 01:01:53.487]  Well, Google's already been caught doing things like that before, but we know how they're going to shut the web down.
[01:01:53.487 --> 01:01:55.389]  I mean, they've said how they're going to do it.
[01:01:55.389 --> 01:02:00.373]  Taxes, regulation, prior constraint.
[01:02:00.373 --> 01:02:02.074]  They're talking about forcing.
[01:02:02.074 --> 01:02:06.177]  When you have one view where the government will superimpose via...
[01:02:08.519 --> 01:02:09.219]  We're good to go.
[01:02:31.647 --> 01:02:32.147]  Okay, I appreciate it.
[01:02:32.147 --> 01:02:32.527]  Thanks.
[01:02:59.861 --> 01:03:09.627]  Kind of, but I mean, if they can alter the search results at their will, that's going to be a bad thing, too.
[01:03:09.627 --> 01:03:12.768]  Well, that's why we need to get away from Google with some of the alternatives that are out there.
[01:03:12.768 --> 01:03:14.930]  I appreciate your call, Louis.
[01:03:14.930 --> 01:03:15.910]  Good points.
[01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:17.211]  Allen, New York, you're on the air.
[01:03:18.927 --> 01:03:20.729]  Okay, thank you very much, Alex.
[01:03:20.729 --> 01:03:22.331]  Thank you for all your great work.
[01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.051]  Thank you.
[01:03:23.051 --> 01:03:38.105]  Something, because I'm over 50, I remember something that maybe some of your other listeners might not have in their minds when they're looking at this incident with Lauren Valley and Rand Paul.
[01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:44.951]  That goes back to September of 75, just watching this woman
[01:03:45.900 --> 01:03:52.301]  And people restraining her reminded me of the squeaky-foam incident with Gerald Ford.
[01:03:52.301 --> 01:04:06.004]  And it's impossible to know when it's unfolding whether or not this woman is potentially a danger to the candidate or not.
[01:04:06.004 --> 01:04:08.205]  And I think there's another thing to remember.
[01:04:08.205 --> 01:04:15.226]  Your instinct about maybe Rand Paul hunkering down and keeping a low profile until this election
[01:04:16.039 --> 01:04:29.524]  Uh, is probably a very good idea because, uh, not long after the Squeaky Frome incident with Gerald Ford, uh, Sarah Jane Moore popped up and tried basically the same thing, and they were able to get that close.
[01:04:30.479 --> 01:04:37.760]  uh... to the president or to a candidate uh... because you know they didn't look threatening.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.061]  I'll tell you what Al, stay there.
[01:04:39.061 --> 01:04:52.903]  I want to come back for those that aren't sure what we're exactly talking about to recap what's happened with Rand in the last few days uh... and uh... where you see this uh... going but absolutely uh... it looked like she was trying to make the car wreck.
[01:04:52.903 --> 01:04:58.624]  I mean she was running up in the window throwing her sign in people grab her and take her to the ground and it's like oh my gosh
[01:04:59.104 --> 01:05:01.325]  I mean, what do you expect is gonna happen?
[01:05:01.325 --> 01:05:05.406]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:05:05.406 --> 01:05:06.666]  Tyranny is here.
[01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:10.387]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:05:10.387 --> 01:05:12.828]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:05:12.828 --> 01:05:18.250]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:25.379]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:05:25.379 --> 01:05:31.368]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:05:31.368 --> 01:05:35.033]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:05:35.513 --> 01:05:39.817]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:05:39.817 --> 01:05:45.762]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:05:45.762 --> 01:05:49.325]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:05:49.325 --> 01:05:51.286]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:05:51.286 --> 01:05:52.407]  It's here.

[01:06:01.144 --> 01:06:05.326]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[01:06:05.326 --> 01:06:11.728]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[01:06:11.728 --> 01:06:19.131]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[01:06:19.131 --> 01:06:23.673]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[01:06:32.661 --> 01:06:36.924]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[01:06:36.924 --> 01:06:43.690]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[01:06:43.690 --> 01:06:47.593]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[01:06:47.593 --> 01:06:47.994]  Call us.
[01:07:01.761 --> 01:07:16.189]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:07:17.222 --> 01:07:21.904]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:07:21.904 --> 01:07:34.670]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:07:34.670 --> 01:07:41.954]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:07:42.634 --> 01:07:53.002]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:56.924]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:07:56.924 --> 01:08:00.047]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:08:02.717 --> 01:08:09.347]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.347 --> 01:08:12.331]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.741 --> 01:08:16.942]  We're back live, eight minutes into the second hour.
[01:08:16.942 --> 01:08:26.848]  We're going to continue later in the broadcast, covering a lot of election news and economic news, interspersed with two different guests we have joining us, dealing with mortgage fraud.
[01:08:26.848 --> 01:08:36.353]  One of them is one of the most successful lawyers in the country, according to the Wall Street Journal, beating the mortgage companies over and over again in court.
[01:08:36.353 --> 01:08:40.476]  The article, if you want to read it, is, uh, niche lawyers spawned housing fracas.
[01:08:41.957 --> 01:08:47.659]  These are the people going back over the last five, six years that have been trailblazing and discovering the fraud.
[01:08:47.659 --> 01:08:51.060]  They're the guys that discovered the robo-signing fraud.
[01:08:51.060 --> 01:09:00.883]  In a deposition, they just asked, in one case, going back now five years ago, can we please see title?
[01:09:00.883 --> 01:09:04.005]  And can we please see the loan review documents?
[01:09:04.005 --> 01:09:04.785]  And they didn't have them.
[01:09:05.812 --> 01:09:06.152]  I think?
[01:09:21.778 --> 01:09:31.705]  And that's how you have JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs in mainstream articles, in court, losing now, because they're taking houses they don't even own, much less have the deed to.
[01:09:31.705 --> 01:09:38.631]  I mean, this is the free-for-all, and Congress is now announcing that they have passed a law.
[01:09:38.631 --> 01:09:44.355]  Obama pocket-vetoed it until after the election, meaning he didn't veto it, he just set it aside.
[01:09:44.355 --> 01:09:50.880]  He can sign it later, where they can basically take any house for any reason, and it's the end of property rights.
[01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:58.413]  Kind of like they used the banking crisis they created with derivatives to get a blank check to steal trillions in bailout.
[01:09:58.413 --> 01:10:09.256]  And then this year they passed the Banking Reorganization Act, which gave the Federal Reserve even more power, and the SEC more anonymity, so they can't get in trouble for protecting Bernie Madoff and others.
[01:10:09.256 --> 01:10:12.617]  So, that's coming up, but I want to continue with your phone calls.
[01:10:12.617 --> 01:10:18.978]  Now, if you just joined us, Al in New York, we're going back to him, my gut level instinct
[01:10:20.506 --> 01:10:21.666]  I don't think so.
[01:10:38.539 --> 01:10:41.041]  And look, I'm not for turning and running.
[01:10:41.041 --> 01:10:44.104]  I'm always for challenging the enemy when it's on your terms.
[01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:46.966]  But he's five to eight points ahead.
[01:10:46.966 --> 01:10:50.048]  He's lost some points.
[01:10:50.048 --> 01:10:51.950]  I've looked at a wide index of polls.
[01:10:51.950 --> 01:11:00.176]  I talked to Ron Paul privately a few weeks ago, and he said, yes, it looks like Rand's, you know, five, six points ahead, but they could pull some tricks.
[01:11:00.176 --> 01:11:01.637]  So people, you know, need to know that
[01:11:02.538 --> 01:11:03.799]  And he didn't say it was off record.
[01:11:03.799 --> 01:11:05.259]  He talked about it on air as well.
[01:11:05.259 --> 01:11:09.641]  The point is, he said he's worried about dirty tricks and things like that.
[01:11:09.641 --> 01:11:10.861]  And we all are.
[01:11:10.861 --> 01:11:13.082]  And there's election fraud as well.
[01:11:13.082 --> 01:11:18.465]  Rand can do TV, can do radio, can do a lot of things.
[01:11:18.465 --> 01:11:20.285]  I wouldn't make an announcement if I was him.
[01:11:20.285 --> 01:11:24.807]  Because in the media, I'll make a big issue of him hiding out.
[01:11:24.807 --> 01:11:28.469]  But, you know, we're talking four days now.
[01:11:28.469 --> 01:11:28.789]  Friday.
[01:11:30.402 --> 01:11:32.203]  Saturday, Sunday, Monday.
[01:11:32.203 --> 01:11:36.085]  Four full days, four and a half total, till Super Tuesday.
[01:11:36.085 --> 01:11:38.727]  And I have called the campaign.
[01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.688]  I've talked to their people.
[01:11:40.688 --> 01:11:42.569]  Gave them my advice.
[01:11:42.569 --> 01:11:44.450]  I have talked about it on air.
[01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:46.611]  And I said, don't go to that debate.
[01:11:46.611 --> 01:11:50.634]  And I've said, and quite frankly, I would not be at a lot of big public events.
[01:11:51.451 --> 01:11:55.816]  Because you've seen what's happened to other candidates the system doesn't like.
[01:11:55.816 --> 01:12:00.462]  It's not like Rand Paul's gonna save the world on his own, but he's a great candidate, a great patriot.
[01:12:01.488 --> 01:12:07.573]  I mean, you've seen the Republicans come after him in the primary and pull out all the stops and have Dick Cheney campaign against him.
[01:12:07.573 --> 01:12:12.758]  Now Bill Clinton's there campaigning against him for the Democrat challenger, Jack Conway.
[01:12:12.758 --> 01:12:25.048]  You see the media literally blacking out huge news of Conway and his brother and clear obstruction of justice in narcotics investigations of his brother and tipping him off about a police raid.
[01:12:25.048 --> 01:12:25.929]  This is confirmed.
[01:12:25.929 --> 01:12:28.291]  They admit this, but nothing's happening with it.
[01:12:28.991 --> 01:12:33.335]  It's getting a little more attention because of the number one search term we did yesterday.
[01:12:33.335 --> 01:12:41.403]  It's so important to get this out, but my gut tells me, as I said last week, and I think this has been borne out, that he needs to basically hide out.
[01:12:42.242 --> 01:12:47.024]  And it's too close to the election for them to notice that or do anything about it.
[01:12:47.024 --> 01:12:53.747]  Quite frankly, going out to little rallies and things is going to maybe pick him up half a percentage point or something.
[01:12:53.747 --> 01:12:57.248]  Concentrating on doing local Kentucky radio.
[01:12:57.248 --> 01:13:00.449]  He should be doing radio, and I'll guarantee you they want him on radio.
[01:13:00.449 --> 01:13:02.750]  He should be doing radio from 6 a.m.
[01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.011]  in the morning till midnight.
[01:13:05.049 --> 01:13:08.290]  That's the real power, that's the listener's talk radio.
[01:13:08.290 --> 01:13:13.391]  He should be putting press releases out on his views, you know, every hour.
[01:13:13.391 --> 01:13:18.153]  He should be doing national television when it's friendly, you know, a few times a day.
[01:13:18.153 --> 01:13:21.393]  Not going all over Kentucky, okay?
[01:13:21.393 --> 01:13:22.954]  I think he's in danger.
[01:13:22.954 --> 01:13:25.915]  I mean, I don't mean just in danger of stunts being pulled on him.
[01:13:25.915 --> 01:13:30.216]  This woman was wearing a wig, runs up, bust through security, she's wearing a disguise,
[01:13:30.976 --> 01:13:39.681]  She runs up to the rolling vehicle as it comes to a stop, and is trying to cram the sign in to the open window on him, and trying to reach in.
[01:13:39.681 --> 01:13:42.462]  I mean, what do you expect security people to think?
[01:13:42.462 --> 01:13:52.487]  You've got a hot Senate campaign that's getting number one attention nationwide, and somebody busts through, runs in, and the Ron Paul supporter three days ago said that's what she did.
[01:13:52.487 --> 01:13:54.088]  The media said, oh, you're liars.
[01:13:54.088 --> 01:13:56.389]  Now the videos come out, they told the truth.
[01:13:56.389 --> 01:13:59.231]  Now, Al in New York was bringing up stuff that was done
[01:14:00.532 --> 01:14:13.649]  To Gerald Ford very similar to this, but I'm thinking something more like you know what happened with a presidential candidate they didn't like Right around that time and you remember he got shot and put in a wheelchair
[01:14:14.797 --> 01:14:31.387]  Uh, and so there's so many, so many cases of this type of stuff and I'm telling you, I'm telling you, he's gonna win right now unless they can pull some bigger stunt or have a woman run up at an event he's giving and scream, he raped me, he raped me.
[01:14:31.387 --> 01:14:38.191]  I mean, there's no telling what they, what they'll do and, and I'm just, I'm just really concerned for Rand Paul right now.
[01:14:38.191 --> 01:14:40.132]  Uh, Al in New York, make your points.
[01:14:41.021 --> 01:14:42.722]  Yes, Alex, thank you very much.
[01:14:42.722 --> 01:14:54.526]  Well, looking at the video of this Lauren Valley, she really had the same kind of a demented look that Sarah Jane Moore and Squeaky Frome had.
[01:14:54.526 --> 01:15:01.589]  And, you know, the security people around Rand Paul shouldn't really hesitate.
[01:15:02.222 --> 01:15:15.629]  Uh, if another incident happens, because I know that they would probably err on, you know, on the side of caution next time so that they couldn't be demonized, but better to be demonized than for something much worse to happen.
[01:15:15.629 --> 01:15:19.931]  So I say, if it happened again the same way, react the same way.
[01:15:21.599 --> 01:15:25.062]  And basically, Alex, thank you very much for your great work.
[01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.684]  Really appreciate it.
[01:15:26.684 --> 01:15:37.453]  Well, you remember what happened to George Wallace, and certainly I didn't agree with his politics, but it was a similar free-for-all in the media, and the media calling him a racist and all this stuff.
[01:15:37.453 --> 01:15:39.595]  They're doing the same thing to Rand Paul.
[01:15:39.595 --> 01:15:43.899]  You know, the liberals are always saying, oh, your rhetoric may cause violence.
[01:15:43.899 --> 01:15:46.221]  What about their rhetoric causing violence?
[01:15:47.250 --> 01:15:55.878]  Well, the double standard is really striking because the rhetoric on the other side has been far more extreme.
[01:15:55.878 --> 01:16:05.286]  I think that Rand has been extremely considerate of everybody's feelings, and I guess the reverse hasn't been true.
[01:16:06.906 --> 01:16:08.207]  Well, you know, that's another issue.
[01:16:08.207 --> 01:16:10.208]  And I didn't try to call their campaign yesterday.
[01:16:10.208 --> 01:16:12.208]  I figured listeners would get them word.
[01:16:12.208 --> 01:16:16.110]  But I am able to get some of their senior people on the phone if I wait around for an hour.
[01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:17.731]  They're all very busy.
[01:16:17.731 --> 01:16:19.412]  But, I mean, they're smart.
[01:16:19.412 --> 01:16:20.312]  They're not stupid.
[01:16:20.312 --> 01:16:21.893]  Jesse Benton's not stupid.
[01:16:21.893 --> 01:16:23.113]  I know him well.
[01:16:23.113 --> 01:16:28.776]  And, you know, this is not dirty politics when they've been playing dirty on them with lies.
[01:16:28.776 --> 01:16:32.258]  It's not dirty politics to go out and give a press conference
[01:16:33.439 --> 01:16:46.273]  Uh, dealing with Jack Conway blocking and warning his brother about a narcotics investigation and then the detectives lying about it and now admitting they lied about it and Jack Conway's brother lying about it.
[01:16:46.273 --> 01:16:47.835]  I mean, this is clearly obstruction.
[01:16:47.835 --> 01:16:48.836]  Shouldn't Rand Paul...
[01:16:49.497 --> 01:16:55.581]  If he does anything, you know, go on Fox or something, and talk about this, he could snap his fingers.
[01:16:55.581 --> 01:17:03.665]  He's the only person that the media couldn't ignore, and to put this out four days before an election, and it will sink Jack Conway.
[01:17:03.665 --> 01:17:09.969]  Jack Conway has gained a little on-ram with all these dirty tricks, because there's useful idiots out there that'll believe anything.
[01:17:09.969 --> 01:17:16.253]  And, you know, I don't, I mean, I understand Ron Paul and Rand Paul are super classy, but look.
[01:17:17.842 --> 01:17:22.923]  It's not, though, classy when you've got Jack Conway obstructing justice.
[01:17:22.923 --> 01:17:25.184]  I think they have a responsibility to come out and talk about it.
[01:17:25.184 --> 01:17:26.704]  What do you think, Al?
[01:17:26.704 --> 01:17:36.607]  Yeah, I agree with you because I think when things are not aggressively responded to, I think that they just sort of lie there and they fester.
[01:17:36.607 --> 01:17:38.667]  And that's the problem that we have.
[01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:44.689]  They've thrown so much dirt that we really have to worry about the fact that, you know, the high road
[01:17:45.490 --> 01:17:51.154]  Uh, is something that I guess the American electorate really doesn't understand.
[01:17:51.154 --> 01:17:57.179]  I hope they understand it, but maybe these things have to be aggressively responded to.
[01:17:57.179 --> 01:17:58.520]  And I agree with you there, Alex.
[01:18:03.143 --> 01:18:06.584]  92, not that George Herbert Walker was any better, but the truth's the truth.
[01:18:06.584 --> 01:18:10.205]  And they didn't get into whitewater and cocaine dealing and raping women.
[01:18:10.205 --> 01:18:12.086]  That was all known about Bill Clinton then.
[01:18:12.086 --> 01:18:13.686]  It should have been brought out then.
[01:18:13.686 --> 01:18:18.528]  And Bill Clinton's clearly positioning Jack Conway as a presidential run later.
[01:18:18.528 --> 01:18:22.009]  We need to shut down Jack Conway now, not later.
[01:18:22.009 --> 01:18:23.649]  I agree with you.
[01:18:23.649 --> 01:18:29.671]  I think that if not Rand himself and his surrogates should come out and expose this story.
[01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:30.471]  I think that this is
[01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:36.446]  The biggest story of the campaign, what you've uncovered is absolutely fantastic.
[01:18:50.017 --> 01:19:00.766]  They interviewed the detectives who admitted they got tipped off, admitted they had meetings with Conway's brother, the Attorney General, admittedly that they covered all this up, and admittedly they told him a SWAT team raid was coming.
[01:19:00.766 --> 01:19:01.766]  We have them!
[01:19:01.766 --> 01:19:02.527]  It's over!
[01:19:02.527 --> 01:19:09.192]  I mean, if they simply expose this, it's over for Jack Conway and Matt Conway, his brother.
[01:19:09.192 --> 01:19:14.437]  I mean, his brother already had to resign his prosecutor role because of this.
[01:19:14.437 --> 01:19:15.578]  What does that tell you?
[01:19:16.482 --> 01:19:18.603]  Well, you were the one who connected the dots.
[01:19:18.603 --> 01:19:26.925]  The newspaper, I guess, really doesn't have a vested interest in connecting the dots, but the Paul campaign certainly does.
[01:19:26.925 --> 01:19:35.147]  Well, I'm surprised the newspaper even ran with it, because that particular paper has given money to Conway and has been supportive of him.
[01:19:35.147 --> 01:19:37.867]  And that's why they didn't put Conway in the headline.
[01:19:37.867 --> 01:19:41.628]  They didn't point out that it was Conway's brother until deep in the article.
[01:19:41.628 --> 01:19:43.209]  But look, at least they did their job.
[01:19:43.209 --> 01:19:44.529]  We talked to the reporter last night.
[01:19:45.229 --> 01:19:46.731]  And he doesn't want to come on the show.
[01:19:46.731 --> 01:19:48.673]  He says he doesn't do media interviews.
[01:19:48.673 --> 01:19:51.316]  He says he lets his article speak for themselves.
[01:19:51.316 --> 01:19:53.138]  So we at least appreciate the writer.
[01:19:53.138 --> 01:19:53.858]  All right, Al.
[01:19:53.858 --> 01:19:54.619]  Thanks for the call.
[01:19:54.619 --> 01:19:56.641]  Barney, Joe, Steve, John, others.
[01:19:56.641 --> 01:19:57.702]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:19:57.702 --> 01:19:58.463]  InfoWars.com.
[01:20:01.781 --> 01:20:05.865]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:20:05.865 --> 01:20:10.369]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:20:10.369 --> 01:20:16.535]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:20:16.535 --> 01:20:18.957]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:20:18.957 --> 01:20:24.943]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:20:25.043 --> 01:20:28.444]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:20:28.444 --> 01:20:30.325]  There is no other program of its kind.
[01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.506]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[01:20:32.506 --> 01:20:37.387]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.
[01:20:37.387 --> 01:20:38.188]  Guaranteed.
[01:20:38.188 --> 01:20:42.229]  Prevent wage garnishments, bank levies, and stop collection calls with our proven program.
[01:20:42.489 --> 01:20:50.535]  Call Zero Debt in 90 days now, 800-477-9256, and ask for free information from an expert who also completed our program.
[01:20:50.535 --> 01:20:51.416]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:52.517]  800-477-9256 or ZeroDebtGuarantee.com.
[01:21:05.504 --> 01:21:06.765]  Tyranny is here.
[01:21:06.765 --> 01:21:10.687]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:21:10.687 --> 01:21:12.929]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:21:12.929 --> 01:21:18.792]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:25.036]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:21:25.456 --> 01:21:31.401]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:21:31.401 --> 01:21:35.604]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:21:35.604 --> 01:21:39.908]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:21:39.908 --> 01:21:45.853]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:21:45.853 --> 01:21:49.416]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:21:49.416 --> 01:21:51.377]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:21:51.377 --> 01:21:51.818]  It's here.
[01:21:52.478 --> 01:22:00.342]  Secure your copy today at InfoWars.com, or see it online in the highest quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:00.342 --> 01:22:03.104]  Again, the Congressional Budget Office sounds the alarm.
[01:22:03.104 --> 01:22:05.145]  This time warns of Greek-style U.S.
[01:22:05.145 --> 01:22:06.045]  debt crises.
[01:22:06.045 --> 01:22:07.086]  You heard me right.
[01:22:07.086 --> 01:22:09.567]  The GAO is drawing a parallel between the U.S.
[01:22:09.567 --> 01:22:13.209]  economy, its debt, and the current Greek economic meltdown.
[01:22:13.209 --> 01:22:20.073]  With the debt-to-GDP chart climbing into unfamiliar territory, the growing budget deficit will rise to unsupportable levels.
[01:22:20.593 --> 01:22:21.833]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:29.016]  The Federal Debt and Risk of Financial Crises document the CBO has published is a must-read for every American.
[01:22:29.016 --> 01:22:36.858]  Covering the risk of continued deficit spending coupled with an aging population and the rising interest rates spell economic disaster.
[01:22:36.858 --> 01:22:40.559]  It's imperative that you get a copy of this document and study it for yourself.
[01:22:40.799 --> 01:22:42.880]  Call me today at 800-686-2237 and I'll send you a free copy.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.061]  Again, call 800-686-2237 and ask for your copy of the CBO document.
[01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:47.121]  Once again, you need to read this government report.
[01:22:47.121 --> 01:22:47.422]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.316 --> 01:23:02.377]  As gardeners, we can all relate.

[01:24:10.947 --> 01:24:13.870]  We've got a new article out at PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:18.114]  Jesse Ventura calls for new 9-11 investigation challenges media.
[01:24:18.114 --> 01:24:20.195]  Dealing with the 3,000 dead there.
[01:24:20.195 --> 01:24:24.980]  I want to go back to your phone calls.
[01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.002]  Let's talk to Barney in Texas.
[01:24:28.002 --> 01:24:28.823]  Barney, you're on the air.
[01:24:28.823 --> 01:24:29.424]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:30.506 --> 01:24:32.347]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:24:32.347 --> 01:24:40.151]  I know you've covered Google for many years, but I wanted to bring out a recent article that I didn't hear you mention yet.
[01:24:40.151 --> 01:24:43.332]  It's from FastCompany.com.
[01:24:43.332 --> 01:24:59.320]  Google just came out with a new think tank called Google Ideas, and they hired Jared Cohen, formerly from the State Department, working under Condoleezza Rice, to head up this new think tank.
[01:25:00.231 --> 01:25:12.860]  And in this article it explains that this new think tank, of course, will take on the greatest problems in the world, but also it's going to be part of counter-terrorism and fighting terrorism.
[01:25:12.860 --> 01:25:21.647]  So, admittedly, for the first time that I've seen, Google is now working with the government to fight terrorism.
[01:25:21.647 --> 01:25:27.932]  So that's very alarming, given to the access of all the information they have on every American citizen.
[01:25:27.932 --> 01:25:28.392]  And so now,
[01:25:29.289 --> 01:25:37.437]  If they find something on American Citizen, they have the right now to come out and say, well we said we were going to start fighting terrorism and work with the government, so...
[01:25:38.123 --> 01:25:38.663]  I don't know.
[01:26:00.911 --> 01:26:06.093]  And so, uh, you know, Google is clearly an NSA slash CIA front.
[01:26:06.093 --> 01:26:08.154]  They now basically admit that.
[01:26:08.154 --> 01:26:09.135]  Uh, Barney, good points.
[01:26:09.135 --> 01:26:10.596]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:10.596 --> 01:26:12.156]  Joe in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:26:12.156 --> 01:26:13.957]  Hello, Alex.
[01:26:13.957 --> 01:26:14.617]  How are you, bro?
[01:26:14.617 --> 01:26:15.958]  Good.
[01:26:15.958 --> 01:26:17.179]  Uh, Alex, I'm just calling in.
[01:26:17.179 --> 01:26:28.724]  I talked to you before, uh, this gunsmith up in, uh, Texas, and I came across an article that kind of ties in with the Internet, where we kind of had a victory over the EPA in trying to
[01:26:32.228 --> 01:26:45.476]  Yeah, they're not just going to ban selling lead, they're going to make you turn it in, which is all the stockpiled lead, and so now they have an excuse to confiscate all your ammo, but it's for the environment, Joe.
[01:26:47.383 --> 01:26:49.524]  And I know that's been defeated for now.
[01:26:49.524 --> 01:26:52.385]  The point is that they're trying to ram this through.
[01:26:52.385 --> 01:26:58.548]  And even when Congress said no to the greenhouse gas taxes, notice that the EPA is just going ahead with it.
[01:26:58.548 --> 01:26:59.269]  So that's the danger.
[01:26:59.269 --> 01:27:01.610]  But go ahead, Joe.
[01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:12.035]  Well, it said, in this article, it just said they had the recent victory in the National Shooting Sports Foundation against the EPA, where they proposed this ban.
[01:27:12.035 --> 01:27:16.557]  And the power, you always talk about, Alex, about the power of the Internet and people.
[01:27:18.525 --> 01:27:27.631]  I mean, just thousands of people, they said, got on Facebook and websites and they beat this proposal.
[01:27:27.631 --> 01:27:29.972]  And so, you know, we had a short victory.
[01:27:29.972 --> 01:27:44.262]  And that's why, the other reason I'm calling is because if we got this kind of power on the net like you talk about all the time, Alex, what this stuff they're doing with Rand Paul and things like that through the Internet.
[01:27:45.067 --> 01:27:48.188]  And your website, Alex.
[01:27:48.188 --> 01:28:11.899]  But my concern is how they're, and I had a question, is my concern is that when they tried to, with the voter fraud, and would your thought be, Alex, with them pushing all this stuff over the mainstream media news of the voter fraud, don't you think, Alex, or do you think that they're trying to dissuade the public from even voting?
[01:28:13.703 --> 01:28:20.586]  Yes, and the system is trying to push their whole agenda through as fast as possible because they know people are waking up.
[01:28:20.586 --> 01:28:31.351]  So they're just trying to overwhelm us with the Cybersecurity Act and the election fraud and the open borders and the amnesty and the wars and the naked body scanners and the flu shots.
[01:28:31.351 --> 01:28:39.015]  That's the system panicking to the awakening, trying to just totally break our will and have us capitulate to them.
[01:28:39.015 --> 01:28:40.396]  But it's not going to work because
[01:28:41.096 --> 01:28:48.282]  If the economy was doing great, and people still had plenty of money and plenty of baubles, they might go along with this.
[01:28:48.282 --> 01:28:57.710]  But the bankers have so greedily destroyed the economy while lying and telling us the recession's over, when even mainstream media is having to admit now it's really a depression.
[01:28:57.710 --> 01:28:59.751]  The recession never ended.
[01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:05.036]  They're going to have trouble selling this because they've been caught lying so much, and that's their problem.
[01:29:05.036 --> 01:29:07.357]  The alternative media has so discredited them
[01:29:08.438 --> 01:29:08.958]  I don't know.
[01:29:26.147 --> 01:29:27.448]  And intensifying.
[01:29:27.448 --> 01:29:31.169]  Great points, Joe, Steve, John, Ronnie, Bill, and others.
[01:29:31.169 --> 01:29:39.393]  Your calls are coming up, but we've got a lawyer coming on from a law firm that's been having real success against the mortgage companies.
[01:29:39.393 --> 01:29:42.235]  Then we got Randy Kelton popping in to talk about it as well.
[01:29:42.235 --> 01:29:44.476]  Your phone calls continuing throughout the broadcast.
[01:29:44.476 --> 01:29:44.876]  Stay with us.
[01:29:51.769 --> 01:29:55.701]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.701 --> 01:29:58.389]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.308 --> 01:30:05.851]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:30:05.851 --> 01:30:06.772]  Number 1.
[01:30:06.772 --> 01:30:10.194]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:30:10.194 --> 01:30:11.055]  Number 2.
[01:30:11.055 --> 01:30:15.958]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:30:15.958 --> 01:30:16.698]  It's true.
[01:30:16.698 --> 01:30:21.562]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:30:21.562 --> 01:30:22.402]  Number 3.
[01:30:22.402 --> 01:30:25.984]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:30:25.984 --> 01:30:29.667]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:30:29.887 --> 01:30:30.668]  Number 4.
[01:30:30.668 --> 01:30:33.430]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:37.113]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:30:37.113 --> 01:30:37.914]  Number 5.
[01:30:37.914 --> 01:30:42.058]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:30:42.058 --> 01:30:46.822]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:32:58.548 --> 01:32:59.429]  Others don't.
[01:33:11.159 --> 01:33:17.108]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:24.283]  Okay, we are back live.
[01:33:24.283 --> 01:33:34.387]  I saw last week a Wall Street Journal article that was the most detailed I've seen yet, titled, Niche Lawyers Spawned Housing Fracas.
[01:33:34.387 --> 01:33:46.132]  And it's got a list of four or five law firms going back the last six years that discovered the robo-signing because of depositions they were doing with lenders, with banks that
[01:33:47.092 --> 01:33:51.856]  That they were engaged in breaking all of these laws and procedures.
[01:33:51.856 --> 01:33:59.383]  And so we've got one of the lawyers on with one of the most successful law firms, Dustin A. Zaks, with the ICE law firm.
[01:33:59.383 --> 01:34:01.685]  Mr. ICE is the founder of it.
[01:34:01.685 --> 01:34:08.311]  And we're going to be going over that for the balance of this hour, the next 25 minutes or so, here in just a moment.
[01:34:09.271 --> 01:34:12.813]  And even if your mortgage isn't in trouble, this affects the entire economy.
[01:34:12.813 --> 01:34:22.577]  The government's getting ready to bail out these mortgage companies, and that's why Bank of America and others have frozen all foreclosures, because they've been caught with their pants down, their hands in the cookie jar.
[01:34:22.577 --> 01:34:27.679]  So we're going to him, Dustin Azax, here in just a moment.
[01:34:28.319 --> 01:34:28.559]  Yeah.
[01:34:43.865 --> 01:34:45.046]  It's made fresh every week.
[01:34:45.046 --> 01:34:49.128]  It's not some old stuff from the army or something like a lot of places are selling.
[01:34:49.128 --> 01:34:50.949]  It's efoodsdirect.com.
[01:34:50.949 --> 01:34:53.330]  You'll never stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.

[01:35:02.454 --> 01:35:04.155]  I bought a lot of storable food before I found them.
[01:35:04.155 --> 01:35:05.176]  They're high quality.
[01:35:05.176 --> 01:35:06.456]  A lot of the others aren't, as I said.
[01:35:06.456 --> 01:35:11.579]  And until midnight on October 31st, it is free shipping.
[01:35:12.299 --> 01:35:13.921]  Excuse me, Monday, November 1st.
[01:35:13.921 --> 01:35:15.743]  You go through Monday.
[01:35:15.743 --> 01:35:21.290]  And so, I just want to be clear here that that is a huge deal when you're talking about shipping a whole bunch of food.
[01:35:21.290 --> 01:35:22.912]  That is a huge discount.

[01:35:52.088 --> 01:35:52.809]  We're good to
[01:36:07.005 --> 01:36:34.418]  It's coming to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, 5.95 a month, or you can get a couple months free when you sign up for a year, PrisonPlanet.tv, and of course there is the online video slash Patriot Apparel bookstore, also at InfoWars.com, and your purchase of the books, the videos, materials, makes this radio show possible, plus it informs you to a higher level, and gives you a tool to give friends, family, neighbors, who are really ready to be awakened now.
[01:36:35.609 --> 01:36:39.391]  Now, before I go any further, we've only got about 25 minutes with our guest.
[01:36:39.391 --> 01:36:44.714]  He's very busy, obviously, handling hundreds of mortgage cases, but I want to challenge all of you.
[01:36:44.714 --> 01:36:59.782]  Of all the mainstream articles I've seen, the best is this Wall Street Journal, Robbie Whalen article, Niche Lawyers Spawned Housing Fracas, and it goes through, what is it, four or five law firms that first started having the big victories.
[01:37:00.908 --> 01:37:05.902]  And it goes through some of the basic reasons these mortgage companies are in so much trouble.
[01:37:06.991 --> 01:37:11.853]  Things like not having the deeds, or not reviewing the foreclosure documents.
[01:37:11.853 --> 01:37:30.480]  I mean, these are serious issues, and that's how you hear about homes that are paid for being taken, or two or three or four banks trying to foreclose on the same house, because they were all put in these derivative pools, breaking the chain of custody, breaking the common law private property issues.
[01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:33.521]  And they quote here, in deep research in the Wall Street Journal,
[01:37:34.321 --> 01:37:37.863]  As the economy frayed, bankruptcy clients appeared.
[01:37:37.863 --> 01:37:45.206]  Mr. Ice would help them with Chapter 13 filings that enable individuals with the judge's blessings to get rid of credit card, car payment, and other debt.
[01:37:45.206 --> 01:37:48.047]  But the law didn't let judges reduce someone's mortgage.
[01:37:48.047 --> 01:37:51.408]  Searching for a way to defend clients facing foreclosure.
[01:37:51.408 --> 01:37:53.209]  This is what Randy Kelton's been saying for two years.
[01:37:53.829 --> 01:37:59.032]  Mr. Ice began researching English case law and the history of property rights.
[01:37:59.032 --> 01:38:12.639]  He ran across Sheldon v. Hintley, a 1680 case that said an indebted merchant owes his debt to the person who lent him the money, not to a debtor collector who came around bearing a note.
[01:38:12.639 --> 01:38:14.040]  And we have that, of course,
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.001]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:38:16.001 --> 01:38:21.766]  First, you know, I've been with the firm a couple years now, since really the height of the crisis, and it's really surprising.
[01:38:21.766 --> 01:38:24.588]  Every day brings something new that the banks are doing.
[01:38:43.556 --> 01:38:51.000]  Uh, in trying to get away with in court, you know, ranging from, as you covered, there's affidavits, uh, that have been, uh, clearly perjured.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.963]  Uh, there have been actual law firms submitting that same kind of documentation.
[01:38:55.963 --> 01:39:07.128]  And then there's case after case where, as you say, when they sold these loans, they simply don't have the proof, uh, that the loan was sold and that the party who's suing my client actually owns these loans.
[01:39:07.128 --> 01:39:10.110]  And a lot of that has to do with the, uh, securitization process.
[01:39:10.967 --> 01:39:11.067]  Yeah.
[01:39:31.959 --> 01:39:36.343]  Well, the bill dealing with notarization is troubling.
[01:39:36.343 --> 01:39:40.106]  Notarization is, you know, it's a requirement for several reasons.
[01:39:40.106 --> 01:39:44.669]  One of them being, there's supposed to be some kind of seriousness when you sign your name to a document.
[01:39:44.669 --> 01:39:46.451]  And in my case, as I'm seeing,
[01:39:58.605 --> 01:39:59.706]  Assignments of mortgages.
[01:39:59.706 --> 01:40:03.947]  You know, documents that purport to transfer my client's mortgage.
[01:40:03.947 --> 01:40:05.428]  Or, you know, a note.
[01:40:05.428 --> 01:40:09.390]  In many of those cases, when you have to notarize them, there have been problems.
[01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:21.855]  And we have taken a deposition at someone at a law firm down here who admitted that their notaries were actually going back and notarizing these documents as if they had signed them six months ago.
[01:40:21.855 --> 01:40:26.137]  So, to accept blindly a notary from another state
[01:40:27.304 --> 01:40:29.266]  You know, as this law would have allowed them to.
[01:40:29.266 --> 01:40:31.207]  You know, again, that raises all kinds of problems.
[01:40:31.207 --> 01:40:34.450]  Well, this article also deals with the discovery of RoboShining.
[01:40:34.450 --> 01:40:36.171]  Can you break that down for us?
[01:40:36.171 --> 01:40:36.851]  Yeah, of course.
[01:40:36.851 --> 01:40:42.796]  A lot of times, what we'll see as the only evidence in a case against us, it's going to be an affidavit.
[01:40:42.796 --> 01:40:48.820]  That affidavit says many things, but among them, that the plaintiff, whether it's Deutsche Bank, U.S.
[01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:55.205]  Bank, or whoever owns this loan, they're entitled to foreclose, and that my clients owe a certain amount of money.
[01:40:55.888 --> 01:41:07.572]  And they also state under oath, mind you, that they've looked at all the books and records, they've looked at all the servicing documents, and they are sure that, you know, everything is correct in the case.
[01:41:07.572 --> 01:41:22.536]  And what do you know, when I go ahead and take the deposition of someone, you know, whether it's at One West Bank or at GMAC or over at Chase Home Finance, they admit freely and without much pushing that they didn't look at a single document prior to signing these affidavits.
[01:41:24.170 --> 01:41:34.618]  In fact, in the Wall Street Journal, they have quotes from the affidavits, and now other law firms go and depose the very same people, get depositions from the same people you've talked to, and they admit it again.
[01:41:34.618 --> 01:41:35.879]  Absolutely.
[01:41:35.879 --> 01:41:38.481]  It doesn't seem to be a lot of remorse from these folks.
[01:41:38.481 --> 01:41:40.982]  I think they just assumed that was their job.
[01:41:40.982 --> 01:41:46.346]  And, you know, to give you the scale, the employee at GMAC was signing 10,000 documents a month.
[01:41:46.346 --> 01:41:51.370]  We took somebody at OneWest who was signing, similarly, thousands of documents between just a few employees.
[01:41:52.037 --> 01:41:55.579]  And the skill is very similar at Chase Home Finance as well.
[01:41:55.579 --> 01:42:19.290]  Now to be specific, correct me if I'm wrong, if they go into court and they have a lawyer for the firm, or for the bank, or even a lawyer that they've just hired separately as a contractor, he gets up and swears and puts in a filing saying we've checked everything, we've done everything, we own this, and then in many cases it turns out they don't even have the deed
[01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:26.776]  And you've got multiple banks suing to get the same house because it's all been put into one big pool with derivatives.
[01:42:26.776 --> 01:42:30.059]  I mean, isn't that basically lying to the court?
[01:42:30.059 --> 01:42:32.522]  Isn't that engaging in fraud?
[01:42:32.522 --> 01:42:36.205]  I mean, under law, how do you quantify what they're doing?
[01:42:36.205 --> 01:42:38.107]  Well, the scale of it is staggering.
[01:42:38.107 --> 01:42:41.129]  You know, you figure take just the one employee at GMAC.
[01:42:41.129 --> 01:42:42.691]  Under oath, you're absolutely right.
[01:42:42.691 --> 01:42:44.332]  He is stating to the court.
[01:42:44.332 --> 01:42:45.874]  I personally looked at these documents.
[01:42:46.869 --> 01:42:55.772]  You know, 10,000 documents a month, there's no way it's humanly possible for him to have looked through 10,000 foreclosure cases to verify that everything was correct.
[01:42:55.772 --> 01:43:02.015]  So, the best way to equate it is, you know, picture if that had happened at a trial, where I had that gentleman on the stand.
[01:43:02.015 --> 01:43:07.077]  I mean, that would be an astounding admission, you know, that he didn't look at anything.
[01:43:07.077 --> 01:43:09.357]  So, it is fraud.
[01:43:09.357 --> 01:43:16.220]  You know, there are attorney generals all across the nation getting involved now in investigating the robo-signers.
[01:43:17.427 --> 01:43:21.549]  And as I say, you know, our job is to bring that in front of the court.
[01:43:21.549 --> 01:43:28.332]  The courts have a wide variety of things they can do to punish the bank, but among them is to throw out their entire case.
[01:43:29.702 --> 01:43:52.347]  Now studying property law just on the surface, obviously you know a lot more about it than I do, but talking to other lawyers we've had on air, but I've even seen cases with some of my cousins and people who buy a piece of ranch property, but then back 50 years ago somebody didn't execute a title right or there was some fraud involved.
[01:43:53.892 --> 01:43:54.893]  No, you're exactly right.
[01:43:54.893 --> 01:43:57.875]  The ramifications of the fraud and the robo-signing, you know, are huge.
[01:44:23.903 --> 01:44:32.812]  All these homes that were foreclosed on, should they have a document in them that a judge relied on, absolutely that's grounds to reverse the judgment out.
[01:44:32.812 --> 01:44:35.755]  So, the bank's looking at all kinds of liability.
[01:44:35.755 --> 01:44:40.539]  Number one, from obviously the people who were foreclosed out, the people who lost their home.
[01:44:40.539 --> 01:44:42.141]  Next, from Title Company.
[01:44:42.959 --> 01:44:46.920]  And next, from people who may have bought these foreclosed homes.
[01:44:46.920 --> 01:44:50.001]  That was my next issue when I was getting at about the ranch property.
[01:44:50.001 --> 01:44:54.943]  Because, I mean, a lot of people are like, I don't care, my house isn't in trouble, I got plenty of money.
[01:44:54.943 --> 01:45:05.386]  But wait a minute, what if you bought a house from a bank, or from a company, and it's something that they'd foreclosed on two, three years ago, fraudulently, what's gonna happen to them?
[01:45:05.386 --> 01:45:06.366]  Well, that's the problem.
[01:45:06.366 --> 01:45:11.288]  I mean, that's why I say the banks have already started to make announcements about how much money they're putting aside.
[01:45:12.052 --> 01:45:16.795]  Uh, for potential litigation, uh, you know, arising from these issues, and it's in the billions.
[01:45:16.795 --> 01:45:20.918]  Uh, it's clear that, uh, you know, it's kind of having a domino effect.
[01:45:20.918 --> 01:45:30.064]  It's happened in all 50 states, and, uh, you know, I wouldn't be surprised to see more lawsuits, uh, uh, in addition to the few we've seen come out recently, but, uh, no, absolutely.
[01:45:30.064 --> 01:45:31.545]  You buy a foreclosed, uh, home.
[01:45:31.545 --> 01:45:33.066]  You're, you're assuming you get good title.
[01:45:33.066 --> 01:45:34.828]  You have the title checked out.
[01:45:34.828 --> 01:45:40.812]  You know, it's not, uh, your responsibility to check, uh, if somebody was lying to the court in thousands of affidavits.
[01:45:41.804 --> 01:45:45.345]  Now, what's this system that they started using the last five years?
[01:45:45.345 --> 01:45:46.285]  It's called Mears.
[01:45:46.285 --> 01:45:48.426]  Can you tell us about that?
[01:45:48.426 --> 01:45:49.166]  Yeah, real quick.
[01:45:49.166 --> 01:45:58.649]  The basic idea is, as you were saying earlier about property law, there's a lot of requirements where you have to record transfers of property so that the next person who buys it is on notice.
[01:45:58.649 --> 01:46:02.730]  You know, you know who the prior owners were and you can check to see if there were any problems.
[01:46:02.730 --> 01:46:07.872]  What Mears did is they saved the lenders a lot of money and it was created by lenders.
[01:46:07.872 --> 01:46:08.452]  It was created
[01:46:08.934 --> 01:46:12.516]  Uh, in part by Fannie and Freddie and government entities.
[01:46:12.516 --> 01:46:20.119]  And what it does is it eliminates the need for you to record a transfer of the mortgage or a deed of trust.
[01:46:20.119 --> 01:46:24.360]  So, whereas, uh, you know, before, uh, if you were a U.S.
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:27.282]  bank and you had loaned someone the money, you owned the mortgage.
[01:46:27.282 --> 01:46:36.045]  If you wanted to transfer that, say, to put it in a trust like happened during the height of this, you would actually have to go down to the courthouse, uh, record that assignment with the clerk.
[01:46:36.045 --> 01:46:38.086]  So that's very expensive, very tedious.
[01:46:38.743 --> 01:46:53.676]  What MERS does is it prevents that need and basically MERS is a straw man as we call it in legal parlance and basically if you look at your mortgage, if it's a MERS loan, MERS is listed as the mortgagee.
[01:46:53.676 --> 01:46:56.438]  MERS is the person who owns your mortgage.
[01:46:56.438 --> 01:47:03.685]  But it's not properly executed at the courthouse so in common sense then it means it's not legitimate?
[01:47:04.301 --> 01:47:07.102]  Well, what it means is, it's just not transparent.
[01:47:07.102 --> 01:47:14.726]  The whole purpose of making the banks go down to the courthouse and record an assignment is so everybody's on notice, you can see who owns your loan.
[01:47:14.726 --> 01:47:24.230]  And in MERS' case, they could have sold your loan 20 times, and you might never know about it because it's still listed as MERS.
[01:47:24.230 --> 01:47:27.532]  And so that was developed so they could sell it into the derivatives pool?
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.162]  Well, it's developed to save them money when they did that.
[01:47:31.162 --> 01:47:35.205]  And it saved them, you know, millions and millions up until this point.
[01:47:35.205 --> 01:47:41.170]  But then that facilitated the fraud of mortgages being sold over and over again and chopped up in different pieces.
[01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:45.073]  Sir, briefly, what are some of the other frauds that you're finding?
[01:47:45.073 --> 01:47:51.838]  What are some of the, you know, other things that the banks are doing that you've discovered?
[01:47:51.838 --> 01:47:54.560]  Well, a big one is relating to the securitization.
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.722]  Selling these loans, you know, into trusts.
[01:47:57.748 --> 01:48:05.951]  They seem to be either unable or unwilling to produce documents that would prove that a lot of these loans actually got into the trust.
[01:48:05.951 --> 01:48:23.896]  So, you know, we hear a lot about sloppiness in terms of what they're filing with the court now, but it seems like that sloppiness and that failure to file all the necessary paperwork, that was happening during the height of the crisis, during the height of when these loans were being sold ten times.
[01:48:23.896 --> 01:48:26.717]  And what I mean by that is to prove that a loan got into a trust.
[01:48:27.478 --> 01:48:36.206]  You've got to have all kinds of receipts, all kinds of certifications to verify that this loan is listed as an asset in that trust.
[01:48:36.206 --> 01:48:40.730]  And when we ask for that documentation, it's like staring into a black hole.
[01:48:40.730 --> 01:48:44.072]  They just don't have the documentation or they don't want to produce it.
[01:48:44.072 --> 01:48:48.556]  So that's another potential liability for the banks down the line.
[01:48:48.556 --> 01:48:48.696]  Sure.
[01:48:50.700 --> 01:48:52.301]  I mean, again, this is a layman.
[01:48:52.301 --> 01:49:00.926]  My gut is, this is endangering our entire private property system that's worked so well and that made this country such a mecca for investment.
[01:49:00.926 --> 01:49:08.431]  I mean, do you agree that this is starting, I mean, just from your research, to really threaten the entire private property system?
[01:49:08.431 --> 01:49:10.632]  You know, I do think it goes to that scale.
[01:49:10.632 --> 01:49:14.274]  As I said, it's hundreds of thousands of false documents filed in all 56.
[01:49:14.274 --> 01:49:16.916]  So, the scale of that is staggering.
[01:49:16.916 --> 01:49:17.616]  The arrogance
[01:49:18.327 --> 01:49:21.058]  Uh, that the bank had to file these.
[01:49:21.058 --> 01:49:21.781]  You know, it's really...
[01:49:22.341 --> 01:49:25.523]  You know, as an attorney, I take that very seriously and it's kind of insulting.
[01:49:25.523 --> 01:49:29.985]  They just figured no one would catch them, you know, when they were lying to the courts repeatedly.
[01:49:29.985 --> 01:49:43.952]  Well, why are you, according to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first law firms, ICE Legal, and there's a few other before you going back about four years, why are you guys, you know, smaller law firms, the first ones to think to even look at this?
[01:49:43.952 --> 01:49:48.435]  I mean, where are the big mega law firms out there who have clients that are buying $10 million houses?
[01:49:48.435 --> 01:49:50.396]  You'd think they would want to know about this.
[01:49:51.365 --> 01:49:51.885]  That's true.
[01:49:51.885 --> 01:49:55.548]  I mean, the problem has been, naturally, that most of these cases are not defended.
[01:49:55.548 --> 01:49:58.791]  And that's what, you know, let the banks get away with it for so long.
[01:49:58.791 --> 01:50:06.817]  The vast majority of homeowners who are in distress because of the economy, you know, just don't have the means to hire an attorney.
[01:50:06.817 --> 01:50:11.281]  So what we did is we went out on a limb, you know, actually funded our own deposition.
[01:50:11.281 --> 01:50:20.088]  You know, in most of your big-time litigation at big firms, a lot of times the clients will foot the bill for all the discovery to find out things like fraud.
[01:50:20.088 --> 01:50:20.949]  In our case, you know, we
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:24.383]  We just kept seeing the same names over and over and over.
[01:50:24.383 --> 01:50:33.634]  And we said, boy, wouldn't it be curious to see if this gentleman who's signing so many of the documents in just our few hundred cases, if he's actually doing it due diligence.
[01:50:34.793 --> 01:50:36.875]  Can you stay with us for five more minutes on the other side?
[01:50:36.875 --> 01:50:37.955]  Terrific.
[01:50:37.955 --> 01:50:48.683]  Okay, I want to come back and ask you where you think all this is going, the successes you've been having now being imitated and duplicated by others, and any other key points you think are important for people to learn about.
[01:50:48.683 --> 01:50:55.989]  And I'd plug ICE Legal's website, but I've got a sneaking suspicion you guys have got more business than you can handle.
[01:50:55.989 --> 01:50:59.291]  But we'll ask you about that on the other side, but you're certainly helping people.
[01:50:59.291 --> 01:51:00.352]  We appreciate ICE Legal.
[01:51:00.352 --> 01:51:01.033]  We'll be right back.
[01:51:01.789 --> 01:51:03.090]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:03.090 --> 01:51:08.674]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:51:08.674 --> 01:51:13.698]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:51:13.698 --> 01:51:19.262]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:51:19.262 --> 01:51:21.083]  So our friends at Solutions from Science

[01:54:02.455 --> 01:54:08.258]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:08.258 --> 01:54:12.480]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:54:12.480 --> 01:54:21.485]  Well, you get four or five little law firms, they start fighting the big megabanks that are winning, because the big megabanks are completely arrogant.
[01:54:21.485 --> 01:54:25.467]  And it shows how when you let big megacorporations run wild, you end up
[01:54:26.601 --> 01:54:34.904]  Destroying your nation, turning it into a third world country because a business and the average person can't be protected, your nation disintegrates.
[01:54:34.904 --> 01:54:43.807]  And Dustin A. Zaks with ICE Legal, one of the firms that's been winning in court and blocking these people and really exposing the fraud.
[01:54:43.807 --> 01:54:50.590]  I mean, the Wall Street Journal talks about a lot of your successes, but briefly recap some of those for folks.
[01:54:51.394 --> 01:54:52.875]  Well, sure.
[01:54:52.875 --> 01:55:00.277]  We brought to light a lot of the practices that are now being investigated by Attorneys General all over the U.S.
[01:55:00.277 --> 01:55:10.181]  It's exciting to see, and other attorneys are picking up on it, bringing other practices to light that we didn't even know about.
[01:55:10.181 --> 01:55:13.322]  Crazy times, but again, as an attorney, I never thought people would be submitting
[01:55:13.803 --> 01:55:24.009]  Well, I mean, look at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan getting a lot of the bailout money, and their representatives won't tell Congress where the money went.
[01:55:24.009 --> 01:55:26.690]  I mean, these people are bandits.
[01:55:26.690 --> 01:55:33.034]  Well, it seems like, you know, the troubling aspect for me is how this hurts people who aren't even in trouble with their homes.
[01:55:33.034 --> 01:55:37.277]  You know, a lot of people think the banks screwed it up the first time around.
[01:55:37.277 --> 01:55:39.438]  You know, not doing their due diligence, that kind of thing.
[01:55:40.307 --> 01:55:46.811]  This is on the default side of it, you know, this is on the litigation side of it, and it seems like they're screwing it up again.
[01:55:46.811 --> 01:55:57.757]  But to the extent that this prevents housing recovery or has effects for people who are not in foreclosure, you know, that's twice that it seems like they haven't done a whole lot of good for us.
[01:55:58.615 --> 01:56:13.109]  Well, I'd like to get you or Mr. Ice on in the next few weeks to talk about, I mean, I know you can't diagnose cases over the telephone or over the radio, but what the average person can do when they're facing one of these mortgages.
[01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:17.833]  How do they detect or analyze and find out if there is fraud in their mortgage?
[01:56:17.833 --> 01:56:21.477]  I would guess that Ice Legal is overwhelmed right now?
[01:56:21.477 --> 01:56:23.058]  Yeah, pretty busy.
[01:56:23.058 --> 01:56:23.559]  Even busy, yep.
[01:56:24.813 --> 01:56:26.635]  Are you guys taking on more clients?
[01:56:26.635 --> 01:56:27.135]  We sure are.
[01:56:27.135 --> 01:56:33.421]  Yeah, we're mainly in Florida, you know, so happy to speak to anyone facing foreclosure or related issues down in Florida.
[01:56:33.421 --> 01:56:35.283]  Give us the website for ICE Legal.
[01:56:35.283 --> 01:56:38.787]  Sure thing, www.icelegal.com.
[01:56:38.787 --> 01:56:39.748]  I-C-E-Legal.com.
[01:56:39.748 --> 01:56:49.157]  Yeah, well I just want to help people and I'm going to get as many law firms and other groups on that are having success as I can because 100,000 foreclosures a month, I mean, my goodness.
[01:56:50.267 --> 01:56:52.629]  Yeah, the scale of it, again, it's staggering.
[01:56:52.629 --> 01:56:57.434]  The best thing folks can do is get educated, speak to an attorney, whether it's us or anybody.
[01:56:57.434 --> 01:56:58.175]  You know, go ahead and...
[01:56:58.866 --> 01:57:06.068]  Have someone look at your documents to see if some of these robo-signers were signing things, or just to see if there's fishy things going on.
[01:57:06.068 --> 01:57:08.089]  Yeah, but your firm's actually helping people.
[01:57:08.089 --> 01:57:20.413]  I've been studying this for years, looking at it, people calling me about it, listeners wanting me to investigate, and a lot of law firms either don't have your expertise or are lazy, and they just take your money, and then they end up taking the people's houses.
[01:57:20.413 --> 01:57:26.915]  But the law firms listed here in the Wall Street Journal, they've been keeping people in their houses for four years, I mean, and having victories.
[01:57:27.435 --> 01:57:28.155]  Well, that's the key.
[01:57:28.155 --> 01:57:31.737]  You're going to want somebody who has actually, you know, litigation experience.
[01:57:31.737 --> 01:57:42.441]  A lot of, I would say, maybe real estate closing attorneys or something like that aren't actual litigators who do motions and take depositions and go to full trials every day.
[01:57:42.441 --> 01:57:48.464]  And they're playing golf with the local brokerage firm, the local title company, the local banker.
[01:57:48.464 --> 01:57:53.206]  Yeah, well, you know, it's the small legal world.
[01:57:53.206 --> 01:57:54.326]  We've got one minute left.
[01:57:54.326 --> 01:57:56.267]  Where do you see this ending, just in your gut?
[01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:08.219]  Um, you know, it's very tough to say, but I would say with the State Attorney General investigating, it's hard to see how some criminal charges are not going to result down the line.
[01:58:09.318 --> 01:58:16.379]  You know, in a few months or years, it's hard to imagine there's not going to be any criminal repercussions for this kind of thing.
[01:58:16.379 --> 01:58:20.600]  Well, Mr. Zaks, again, I would like to get you or Mr. Ice back on for a full hour.
[01:58:20.600 --> 01:58:29.642]  I know you're busy, but this is a large show, reach a lot of people, to give people some basic ideas of what to look for, what type of lawyers to look for as they fight this.
[01:58:29.642 --> 01:58:34.523]  But it's good to see lawyers doing some good work for the community, and Godspeed to all your work.
[01:58:35.023 --> 01:58:35.844]  Well, thanks for having me.
[01:58:35.844 --> 01:58:36.605]  Appreciate it.
[01:58:36.605 --> 01:58:37.165]  You bet.
[01:58:37.165 --> 01:58:37.445]  You bet.
[01:58:37.445 --> 01:58:38.827]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:58:38.827 --> 01:58:39.728]  We'll cover this more.

[01:59:54.534 --> 01:59:56.896]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.896 --> 01:59:59.679]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:06.243 --> 02:00:11.065]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:11.065 --> 02:00:12.666]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.666 --> 02:00:14.207]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.207 --> 02:00:18.389]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:18.389 --> 02:00:22.471]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.431 --> 02:00:29.478]  Well, you just heard a lawyer from one of the top law firms beating the daylights out of the corrupt banks on the mortgages.
[02:00:29.478 --> 02:00:31.561]  This affects the entire economy.
[02:00:31.561 --> 02:00:34.044]  This affects foreclosed houses you buy.
[02:00:34.044 --> 02:00:37.087]  Or a house that another company foreclosed on and then sold you.
[02:00:39.033 --> 02:00:44.817]  So we're going to be discussing what this means to the entire economy coming up with Randy Kelton after the next segment.
[02:00:44.817 --> 02:00:48.940]  I want to get into other economic news in the next segment and I need to clear the phone lines out.
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:55.005]  We're going to try to take a few of the guys that are holding right now because I want to then open the phones up just on mortgage fraud to take your questions.
[02:00:55.005 --> 02:01:06.393]  But you just heard a law firm winning in court over and over again, basically repeat everything Randy Kelton said and expand on it and say, yeah, we love the other people that are investigating this because they're finding even more fraud.
[02:01:06.753 --> 02:01:11.496]  I mean, it just, we're going to go deep into this with Randy Kelton coming up.
[02:01:11.496 --> 02:01:14.519]  Part 3 of the interview we started a few weeks ago.
[02:01:14.519 --> 02:01:17.681]  But I wanted you to hear from actual lawyers saying the same thing.
[02:01:17.681 --> 02:01:24.326]  But Randy goes even further in his research and he's actually advising a lot of lawyers right now because they just don't know how to research it.
[02:01:24.326 --> 02:01:26.347]  But let's go to Steve in Texas.
[02:01:26.347 --> 02:01:27.228]  Steve, you're on the air.
[02:01:27.228 --> 02:01:28.409]  Go ahead.
[02:01:28.409 --> 02:01:29.309]  Yes, thank you.
[02:01:29.309 --> 02:01:31.971]  I was very chilling.
[02:01:31.971 --> 02:01:34.393]  I bought my property five years ago.
[02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:48.206]  People are having homes taken that are completely paid for because, you know, 11 years ago when this new fraud began, they foreclosed on somebody improperly.
[02:01:49.025 --> 02:01:50.525]  So you may not have clear titles.
[02:01:50.525 --> 02:01:51.906]  Somebody may come take it.
[02:01:51.906 --> 02:01:53.546]  You better investigate.
[02:01:53.546 --> 02:01:58.648]  I paid quite a bit for a title search before I even got the property.
[02:01:58.648 --> 02:02:01.729]  Isn't that the liability of the title company?
[02:02:01.729 --> 02:02:03.389]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:02:03.389 --> 02:02:04.890]  But the banks don't care.
[02:02:04.890 --> 02:02:07.650]  They just bypass the title company and still try to take it.
[02:02:07.650 --> 02:02:11.672]  But now because you know this information, you'll be able to block them.
[02:02:11.672 --> 02:02:16.213]  But for the general public that doesn't... See, this isn't just about people who are being foreclosed on.
[02:02:16.613 --> 02:02:17.294]  Blocking it.
[02:02:17.294 --> 02:02:22.357]  This is about people that have been defrauded by the banks blocking their foreclosure.
[02:02:22.357 --> 02:02:26.860]  I mean, I already have all my receipts of everything I paid the mortgage mortgage company.
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:30.102]  And, you know, I mean, it's supposedly in my mind.
[02:02:30.102 --> 02:02:31.623]  Well, it's like Russian roulette.
[02:02:31.623 --> 02:02:34.425]  I mean, go back to the person before you or before.
[02:02:34.425 --> 02:02:37.467]  I mean, were they wasn't a foreclosure down the road somewhere?
[02:02:38.922 --> 02:02:39.903]  Well, I wasn't aware of it.
[02:02:39.903 --> 02:02:46.327]  They didn't inform me of that, but I thought that was part of the job of the Title Company.
[02:02:46.327 --> 02:02:55.713]  That's the fraud with these digital systems that aren't in the courthouse, is that it allows that to all be muddied.
[02:02:55.713 --> 02:02:56.333]  Oh, God.
[02:02:56.333 --> 02:02:57.074]  I've got to say this.
[02:02:58.052 --> 02:03:01.296]  Alex, I've been with you for about a year.
[02:03:01.296 --> 02:03:06.962]  I've got theinfowars.com and prisonplanningtv and prisonplanning.com and everything.
[02:03:06.962 --> 02:03:08.884]  And man, it's a college education.
[02:03:08.884 --> 02:03:14.610]  And it's like now at least 50% of my time, but I got to tell you, I'm a study of American history.
[02:03:15.186 --> 02:03:17.847]  You are the number one American hero in my book.
[02:03:17.847 --> 02:03:19.747]  I just want you to know that's what I mean.
[02:03:19.747 --> 02:03:21.887]  And I pray for you every day and I thank you.
[02:03:21.887 --> 02:03:23.227]  Well, Steve, God bless you.
[02:03:23.227 --> 02:03:23.848]  God bless you.
[02:03:23.848 --> 02:03:28.028]  Look, I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my grandmother's prayers.
[02:03:28.028 --> 02:03:28.788]  85 years old.
[02:03:28.788 --> 02:03:36.370]  If it wasn't for all the people that pray for us, there is no doubt I got guardian angels and I'm not the number one hero.
[02:03:36.370 --> 02:03:42.271]  Number one heroes are firefighters that run into burning buildings to save children and the chimney collapses on them and kills them.
[02:03:43.519 --> 02:03:49.782]  Number one heroes, even though they're misguided, are troops that charge machine gun nests.
[02:03:49.782 --> 02:03:54.764]  The number one heroes out there are police officers that go up against drug thugs.
[02:03:54.764 --> 02:04:03.588]  The number one heroes are people like Joe Bannister who exposes the fraudulent IRS and they indicted him and he beat him in court.
[02:04:05.201 --> 02:04:19.229]  I am somebody who recognized tyranny 17 years ago, spent two years trying to get on air, got on air on AXS TV, got on radio, got syndicated, did everything I do to expose the corruption.
[02:04:19.229 --> 02:04:22.591]  I live, eat, drink, sleep this information.
[02:04:23.747 --> 02:04:26.168]  Uh, and it doesn't mean we're always right.
[02:04:26.168 --> 02:04:27.408]  Doesn't mean we have all the answers.
[02:04:27.408 --> 02:04:28.869]  We're just trying to learn.
[02:04:28.869 --> 02:04:30.109]  Trying to do good.
[02:04:30.109 --> 02:04:31.730]  Trying to resist corruption.
[02:04:31.730 --> 02:04:33.370]  Trying to figure it out.
[02:04:33.370 --> 02:04:36.131]  And that's a big difference from people that just don't care.
[02:04:36.131 --> 02:04:37.132]  That's who I don't like.
[02:04:37.132 --> 02:04:37.152]  I...
[02:04:38.982 --> 02:04:42.744]  I don't like evil people, but at least they're evil and know what side they're on.
[02:04:42.744 --> 02:04:48.166]  Who I really don't like are smiley-faced, giggling yuppies that think this is all cute and funny.
[02:04:48.166 --> 02:04:51.368]  We're going into hell on earth if we don't turn this around.
[02:04:51.368 --> 02:04:54.209]  So I'm selfishly just trying to survive and save my country.
[02:04:54.209 --> 02:04:56.511]  Because it's the best country we got.
[02:04:56.511 --> 02:04:57.311]  That's why I'm here.
[02:04:57.311 --> 02:04:58.411]  I'm not a hero.
[02:04:58.411 --> 02:04:59.392]  I'm not a hero.
[02:04:59.392 --> 02:05:00.492]  I'm doing my duty.
[02:05:00.492 --> 02:05:01.273]  I'm trying to survive.

[02:05:53.672 --> 02:05:54.192]  Thank you!
[02:06:01.152 --> 02:06:05.715]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:06:05.715 --> 02:06:06.636]  Number 1.
[02:06:06.636 --> 02:06:10.059]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:06:10.059 --> 02:06:10.919]  Number 2.
[02:06:10.919 --> 02:06:15.803]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:06:15.803 --> 02:06:16.543]  It's true.
[02:06:16.543 --> 02:06:21.427]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:06:21.427 --> 02:06:22.248]  Number 3.
[02:06:22.248 --> 02:06:25.830]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:06:25.830 --> 02:06:29.533]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:06:29.733 --> 02:06:30.533]  Number 4.
[02:06:30.533 --> 02:06:33.294]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:06:33.294 --> 02:06:36.976]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:06:36.976 --> 02:06:37.756]  Number 5.
[02:06:37.756 --> 02:06:41.898]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:06:41.898 --> 02:06:46.960]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:06:46.960 --> 02:06:51.141]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:06:51.141 --> 02:06:52.922]  That's mysolarbackup.com.

[02:07:09.268 --> 02:07:20.594]  Global financial meltdown, saber-rattling with Iran and other nations, worldwide drought and food shortages, more than 40 million Americans on food stamps and tens of millions unemployed.

[02:07:48.367 --> 02:07:52.470]  That's 800-409-5633 on the web efoodsdirect.com slash Alex.
[02:07:52.470 --> 02:07:55.172]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:16.656 --> 02:08:18.717]  Okay, we are back live.
[02:08:18.717 --> 02:08:21.779]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:08:21.779 --> 02:08:28.602]  I want to cover economic news to get to John, Bill and Chris and a few others before our next guest is going to be in studio.
[02:08:28.602 --> 02:08:34.385]  And we've got for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers some graphs we're going to be showing here on television.
[02:08:34.385 --> 02:08:39.848]  Then this will be archived at PrisonPlanet.TV and from there pumped out of the four wins.
[02:08:39.848 --> 02:08:42.710]  But we're going to go through a lot dealing with this mortgage fraud.
[02:08:43.470 --> 02:08:47.913]  But this was only the beginning of the fraud to the international derivatives bubble.
[02:08:47.913 --> 02:08:48.933]  And this affects everyone.
[02:08:48.933 --> 02:08:51.935]  This affects most people's mortgages.
[02:08:51.935 --> 02:08:57.278]  Even if you bought your house, you know, 5, 10, 11 years ago when they changed the Glass-Steagall Act.
[02:08:57.278 --> 02:09:02.662]  This doesn't mean just if you're upside down or they're trying to foreclose on you that you're the only ones being targeted.
[02:09:02.662 --> 02:09:04.763]  This is anybody that owns a house.
[02:09:04.763 --> 02:09:09.246]  Because the title companies and these computerized systems are completely filled with fraud.
[02:09:10.026 --> 02:09:20.369]  And that's how banks every day I read about trying to take houses that are paid for that they don't even have a note for because they bought derivatives that say they have your house.
[02:09:20.369 --> 02:09:27.911]  Okay, so I mean this is just amazing and you heard that lawyer earlier saying they've just found the tip of the iceberg of the fraud and that's already stopping most of the foreclosures.
[02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:30.402]  I wanted to get into some other news.
[02:09:30.402 --> 02:09:31.902]  This is out of Bloomberg.
[02:09:31.902 --> 02:09:36.385]  JPMorgan HSBC accused of manipulating silver futures.
[02:09:36.385 --> 02:09:44.048]  They've been accused of investor lawsuit of placing spoof trade orders to manipulate silver futures and opinions prices in violation of U.S.
[02:09:44.048 --> 02:09:45.409]  antitrust law.
[02:09:45.409 --> 02:09:46.790]  That's been coming out for a long time.
[02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:50.672]  We had the gold antitrust group, GATA, on a few months ago first telling you about that.
[02:09:51.452 --> 02:09:55.915]  Also in Reuters, French protest again on pensions, but fatigue waves.
[02:09:55.915 --> 02:09:58.377]  That's what the IMF wrote about in 2002.
[02:09:58.377 --> 02:10:01.579]  In Argentina, they said they'd found that people may riot for six months.
[02:10:02.793 --> 02:10:03.454]  They like that.
[02:10:03.454 --> 02:10:05.196]  That drives down confidence even more.
[02:10:05.196 --> 02:10:10.521]  Then they finally burn out, the economy's imploded, then they come in and consolidate.
[02:10:10.521 --> 02:10:19.111]  The French need to start calling for prosecutions of the bankers that have looted them, not running around throwing fits, demanding their taxes not be raised.
[02:10:19.111 --> 02:10:21.634]  They need to get rid of the bankers and get rid of that system.
[02:10:23.263 --> 02:10:23.864]  Here's another one.
[02:10:23.864 --> 02:10:25.625]  American job loss is permanent.
[02:10:25.625 --> 02:10:31.130]  Dr. Paul Craig Roberts breaks down that they've shipped our jobs out by design.
[02:10:31.130 --> 02:10:32.191]  Employers in the U.S.
[02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:34.754]  start bracing for higher tax withholding.
[02:10:34.754 --> 02:10:39.899]  Oh yeah, and all the new insurance money you gotta pay for your employees, and all the new taxes.
[02:10:41.991 --> 02:10:56.179]  I mean, I don't even know if I can, coming up the next year, if all this Obama tax stuff goes in and all this new Obamacare goes in, I'm having to look at my great crew, every one of them is important, and decide, how do I raise the money to keep them here to pay for all this, or do I let people go?
[02:10:56.179 --> 02:10:58.280]  I mean, this is happening all across the economy.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:01.782]  California is set to pass a 20% carbon tax this week.
[02:11:02.722 --> 02:11:03.703]  They're trying to repeal it.
[02:11:03.703 --> 02:11:05.044]  It kicks in next year.
[02:11:05.044 --> 02:11:07.486]  They're trying to repeal it next Tuesday.
[02:11:07.486 --> 02:11:08.687]  I'm looking at the poll numbers.
[02:11:08.687 --> 02:11:09.308]  It's 50-50.
[02:11:09.308 --> 02:11:11.250]  It's neck and neck.
[02:11:11.250 --> 02:11:17.855]  Can you imagine what's going to happen to California if there's a 20% tax slapped on all the businesses that produce carbon?
[02:11:17.855 --> 02:11:20.798]  The factories?
[02:11:20.798 --> 02:11:20.998]  Huh!
[02:11:20.998 --> 02:11:24.601]  I mean, you think 22% unemployment, that's admitted in California?
[02:11:25.835 --> 02:11:27.076]  60 Minutes reports?
[02:11:27.076 --> 02:11:28.656]  You think 22% unemployment?
[02:11:28.656 --> 02:11:30.157]  You ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:11:30.157 --> 02:11:33.739]  They want to destroy the economy.
[02:11:33.739 --> 02:11:37.240]  And they use the cheap labor from Mexico to do it as well.
[02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:41.042]  So employers start bracing for higher tax withholding.
[02:11:41.042 --> 02:11:41.802]  Employers in the U.S.
[02:11:41.802 --> 02:11:47.865]  are starting to warn their workers to prepare for slimmer paychecks if Congress fails to vote on an extension of the Bush-era tax cuts.
[02:11:47.865 --> 02:11:48.645]  You know, that's the thing.
[02:11:49.861 --> 02:11:53.524]  The establishment has trained everybody that if you got a neighbor making $200,000 a year, they're rich.
[02:11:56.468 --> 02:11:59.049]  Or even a million dollars a year they're rich, no.
[02:11:59.049 --> 02:12:09.733]  True wealthy people make billions a year and they're the ones lobbying for higher taxes to then pay the money into government for banker bailouts and defense contractor money.
[02:12:09.733 --> 02:12:10.973]  They're all offshore.
[02:12:10.973 --> 02:12:15.114]  What was the ABC News headline last Thursday?
[02:12:15.114 --> 02:12:19.196]  Google pays, in fact guys search the term, Google pays 2.5% tax.
[02:12:19.196 --> 02:12:19.356]  Okay?
[02:12:23.914 --> 02:12:25.755]  Okay, I pay on average about 40%.
[02:12:25.755 --> 02:12:28.697]  They claim it's 35% tax bracket baloney.
[02:12:28.697 --> 02:12:30.918]  Okay?
[02:12:30.918 --> 02:12:30.998]  40%.
[02:12:30.998 --> 02:12:32.219]  Now it's going up even more.
[02:12:32.219 --> 02:12:39.783]  Then there's all the other taxes, and the FICA, and the rest of it, and the unemployment insurance, and all the new taxes Texas has passed.
[02:12:39.783 --> 02:12:46.847]  Now, Google, the biggest company in the world, I'm sorry, I was wrong, it's 2.4, I said 2.5, I'm sorry.
[02:12:46.847 --> 02:12:47.347]  Google has a 2.4% rate
[02:12:54.724 --> 02:12:57.826]  They pay 2.4% tax rate.
[02:12:57.826 --> 02:12:59.327]  You gotta love that.
[02:12:59.327 --> 02:13:06.412]  Can you imagine what Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and my operation could do if we were paying 2.4% federal income tax?
[02:13:10.714 --> 02:13:11.736]  Can you imagine?
[02:13:11.736 --> 02:13:14.840]  See, this is all engineered to shut down the little guy.
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:17.624]  Let me explain something to people that work at a restaurant.
[02:13:17.624 --> 02:13:19.667]  You know, waiting tables making $35,000 a year.
[02:13:19.667 --> 02:13:20.989]  Or somebody mowing lawns making $35,000, $40,000 a year.
[02:13:20.989 --> 02:13:22.091]  Oh yeah, they make that.
[02:13:27.185 --> 02:13:37.857]  Not only is all this devaluation of currency going to kill any savings or what you can buy, your purchasing power, but what do you think happens when somebody making $125,000 a year, that's what the tax increases kick in for.
[02:13:41.533 --> 02:13:46.094]  If you actually read the legislation, what do you think happens when somebody has to pay more money?
[02:13:46.094 --> 02:13:57.716]  They have to cut pay, they have to lay people off, they've got the healthcare taxes coming in on top of it, they've got a real estate tax on the healthcare bill of 5% on any real estate, a house you own or rent.
[02:13:57.716 --> 02:13:59.377]  What's that gonna do?
[02:13:59.377 --> 02:14:09.199]  See, it's the people making $125,000 a year that pay for babysitters, that go to restaurants, that go to the mall and buy clothes, that go to the car dealership and buy cars.
[02:14:10.515 --> 02:14:13.936]  They're the people that go to your salon and get their hair done.
[02:14:13.936 --> 02:14:16.297]  They're the people that go to your gym and get a membership.
[02:14:16.297 --> 02:14:23.738]  They're the people that produce almost all the service jobs left in this country.
[02:14:23.738 --> 02:14:25.079]  And guess what?
[02:14:25.079 --> 02:14:26.319]  You can look at the graphs.
[02:14:26.319 --> 02:14:34.721]  As Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, former head of policy at the Treasury, wrote today, the middle class is shrinking dramatically.
[02:14:34.721 --> 02:14:36.702]  It's about half of what it was 30 years ago.
[02:14:37.734 --> 02:14:40.414]  So, there goes your economy.
[02:14:40.414 --> 02:14:42.035]  And the system knows this.
[02:14:42.035 --> 02:14:45.535]  They cut taxes on the middle class, the economy races.
[02:14:45.535 --> 02:14:46.356]  But they don't want that.
[02:14:46.356 --> 02:14:49.296]  They want to shut it down.
[02:14:49.296 --> 02:14:51.116]  I know I'm ranting here.
[02:14:51.116 --> 02:14:56.177]  It's just horrible.
[02:14:56.177 --> 02:14:58.818]  It's absolutely horrible.
[02:14:58.818 --> 02:15:05.499]  And the internet accounts for 7.2% of British economy, study finds, French news agency, but they're coming out with internet taxes in England.
[02:15:07.503 --> 02:15:09.785]  We can't build infrastructure anymore.
[02:15:09.785 --> 02:15:15.131]  New Jersey's canceling all this infrastructure because almost all the money has to go for service on the debt.
[02:15:15.131 --> 02:15:21.237]  Everybody always talks about welfare moms and how they're bankrupting us and how illegal aliens are bankrupting us and that's certainly part of it.
[02:15:21.237 --> 02:15:27.083]  But that's the dependent group that votes to bring in big government so the bankers get two-thirds of the money in debt service.
[02:15:27.984 --> 02:15:28.844]  And who owns the debt?
[02:15:28.844 --> 02:15:32.106]  The Chinese government and then the private Federal Reserve.
[02:15:32.106 --> 02:15:33.467]  They're the two biggest owners.
[02:15:33.467 --> 02:15:36.728]  Chinese number one, Federal Reserve number two.
[02:15:36.728 --> 02:15:41.330]  It's all a stinking fraud.
[02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:42.691]  I want to bring Ted Anderson up.
[02:15:42.691 --> 02:15:44.312]  Gold, they tried to hammer it down.
[02:15:44.312 --> 02:15:47.994]  We've got it right here in Bloomberg with the manipulation of silver, manipulation of gold.
[02:15:49.122 --> 02:15:49.522]  It sure is.
[02:15:49.522 --> 02:15:53.524]  You know, like, when you and I were sitting out there at KCSO, the G20 was beating up on the U.S.
[02:15:53.524 --> 02:15:56.866]  dollar, and it was dropping, and gold was racing upward, and we have that going on.
[02:16:13.593 --> 02:16:26.765]  Again today, but now they're awaiting this announcement by the Fed next week They're expecting the Fed to take newly printed money and to buy 80 to 100 billion dollars worth of assets And that's gonna drive them.
[02:16:26.765 --> 02:16:29.828]  We already seen it the dollar is just crumbling right now.
[02:16:29.828 --> 02:16:34.893]  Gold is up $18.60 right now presently seen a high today of 1346 90 already silver just broke again 24
[02:16:39.737 --> 02:16:39.897]  I think?
[02:17:01.291 --> 02:17:13.274]  And just like the frauds coming out on the mortgages, the fraud of them suppressing gold and silver, which should both be double what it is now for 1980 inflation, as that fraud comes out, they're not going to be able to engage in it.
[02:17:13.274 --> 02:17:14.374]  Yeah, right about that.
[02:17:14.374 --> 02:17:28.838]  And so that creates the opportunities that we have in the gold and silver because of the fact that the exposure of this elite group that has been trying to suppress the prices of gold and silver for years, you know, first of all, you can't
[02:17:29.258 --> 02:17:34.722]  Beat the United States dollar down without having its equal commodity go up.
[02:17:34.722 --> 02:17:39.025]  You know, the gold and silver, you can't print gold and silver like you can print U.S.
[02:17:39.025 --> 02:17:39.965]  dollars.
[02:17:39.965 --> 02:17:52.854]  And so they're having to accelerate the printing press, and that's driving the prices of gold and silver up, and they can't control, they can no longer hold onto the price of gold and keep it low like they did back in the middle 1980s.
[02:17:52.854 --> 02:17:54.135]  Well, to simplify,
[02:17:54.975 --> 02:18:00.816]  The Chinese aren't buying as much of it, so the Federal Reserve is moving towards being the biggest owner of U.S.
[02:18:00.816 --> 02:18:18.839]  T-bills and other instruments, which positions the bankers with even more power, so they're buying our debt, but they're using our money to buy it for themselves, and then we're supposed to pay this back with tax money, and it devalues our money, so they're taxing us two different ways.
[02:18:18.839 --> 02:18:22.220]  Ted, we got a minute and a half left before I come back with Randy Kelton and the mortgage fraud.
[02:18:22.660 --> 02:18:23.481]  I just lost Ted Anderson.
[02:18:44.886 --> 02:18:46.307]  Guys, you got any word on that?
[02:18:46.307 --> 02:18:48.047]  Yeah, what happened?
[02:18:48.047 --> 02:18:49.128]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:18:49.128 --> 02:18:50.388]  Yeah, you cut out for a minute.
[02:18:50.388 --> 02:18:52.249]  Okay, so tell us about the Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:18:52.249 --> 02:19:01.952]  Yeah, the Creature from Jekyll Island did go up in price, and I'm going to have to raise my prices accordingly, but right now I have the new edition, the fifth edition at $26.45 with the silver dollar.
[02:19:01.952 --> 02:19:09.035]  Hey, look, when you're paying $26.45 in spot silver, it's $24, and I'm giving you a free silver dollar to go with it.
[02:19:09.035 --> 02:19:13.096]  Anybody, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that that coin is a
[02:19:13.756 --> 02:19:16.840]  You know, the coin is worth more than the deal itself.
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.922]  Let me fire out the number.
[02:19:18.922 --> 02:19:21.004]  It's 800-686-2237.
[02:19:21.004 --> 02:19:29.754]  They've got a lot of other coins, but you've got to tell folks, it's the Alex Jones Radio Special to get these lost liter prices, or it'll be a little bit more, which is still a great deal.
[02:19:29.754 --> 02:19:29.814]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:29.814 --> 02:19:32.617]  Where are you on the silver half dollars?
[02:19:35.020 --> 02:19:41.906]  The Silver Half Dollars, I'm still holding that price down at $11.77, but it's over $1,300 on the internet.
[02:19:41.906 --> 02:19:45.429]  So yeah, if you want to take advantage of something, get into those Walking Liberties.
[02:19:45.429 --> 02:19:46.270]  Amazing deal.
[02:19:46.270 --> 02:19:51.295]  I think the Walking Liberties are the bigger of a special there.
[02:19:51.295 --> 02:19:51.935]  800-686-2237.
[02:19:51.935 --> 02:19:57.160]  Call and get the Sovereign Gold pieces, the Frank Gold pieces, the Silver Half Dollar Walking Liberties.

[02:21:03.959 --> 02:21:06.140]  We are part of a new world order.
[02:21:06.140 --> 02:21:09.482]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[02:21:09.482 --> 02:21:14.205]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:21:14.565 --> 02:21:19.087]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:21:19.087 --> 02:21:21.428]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:21:21.428 --> 02:21:24.309]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:21:24.309 --> 02:21:27.231]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:21:27.231 --> 02:21:34.834]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:21:35.174 --> 02:21:40.556]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:21:40.556 --> 02:21:43.417]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:21:43.417 --> 02:21:47.079]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:21:47.079 --> 02:21:48.159]  And I got news for you.
[02:21:48.159 --> 02:21:49.500]  You're everyone else.

[02:24:11.094 --> 02:24:13.634]  Look at your women crying.
[02:24:13.634 --> 02:24:19.095]  Look at your young men dying.
[02:24:19.095 --> 02:24:20.575]  We are back live.
[02:24:20.575 --> 02:24:23.656]  For 30 minutes in the last hour we had Dustin A. Zaks on.
[02:24:24.912 --> 02:24:28.954]  From ICE Legal, who's in the Wall Street Journal beating the banks.
[02:24:28.954 --> 02:24:33.676]  And they've got, what, four other law firms here that discovered the Robo signing and have been deposing these people.
[02:24:33.676 --> 02:24:37.758]  And as he said, the fraud goes a lot deeper than just what they've discovered.
[02:24:37.758 --> 02:24:42.401]  He says exactly what pro se litigant Randy Kelton's been saying for several years now.
[02:24:43.781 --> 02:24:44.062]  I don't know.
[02:25:08.530 --> 02:25:19.092]  Next year, they have suspended the big five banks, including Bank of America, two weeks ago, all foreclosures, just because lawyers and pro se litigants have just begun to fight.
[02:25:19.092 --> 02:25:29.434]  Now, Randy, we're going to have you here for the rest of this hour and into the fourth hour in overdrive on our AM and FM affiliates and PrisonPlanet.tv and the streams at InfoWars.com.
[02:25:29.434 --> 02:25:35.776]  I can't do this all the time, but the next few minutes, we are posting at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, a free video box.
[02:25:36.656 --> 02:25:39.958]  So people can see this, just like when I had Governor Ventura on yesterday.
[02:25:39.958 --> 02:25:41.439]  We were playing video clips.
[02:25:41.439 --> 02:25:49.264]  It's so important for radio listeners to also be able to see this as we go through all these big color graphs with documentation that you put together.
[02:25:49.264 --> 02:25:53.587]  We're going to be showing on the document cam today.
[02:25:53.587 --> 02:25:56.368]  Actually, I may move it out here so my shadow's not on it.
[02:25:56.368 --> 02:26:00.431]  Maybe tilt the camera that way so we can not have my shadow on it.
[02:26:02.552 --> 02:26:04.373]  We're going to be showing that to the viewers.
[02:26:04.373 --> 02:26:13.797]  But what did you think of Ice Legal, who's been deposing the banks, beating their socks off, saying clearly the same things that you've basically been talking about?
[02:26:13.797 --> 02:26:26.102]  I think it took an incredible amount of courage for a law firm to take on these big banks and ask judges to render rulings that were new to the judges.
[02:26:26.102 --> 02:26:27.002]  Judges hate to do that.
[02:26:27.885 --> 02:26:32.727]  No judge wants to be the one to change the law, because he doesn't want to be the one to have his case thrown out.
[02:26:32.727 --> 02:26:35.108]  But the banks weren't following the law.
[02:26:35.108 --> 02:26:51.275]  But to get a judge to make a ruling that's different from what he's been doing is really tough, and it took a lot of courage for these attorneys to do that, because an attorney can get in a lot of trouble asking a judge to render a ruling he doesn't want to rule on, so I have to give them credit.
[02:26:51.275 --> 02:26:55.797]  But the political climate is changing dramatically.
[02:26:56.767 --> 02:27:05.755]  It's what we expected back in March when the legislature allotted $200 million to the feds to start going after these guys just before the election.
[02:27:05.755 --> 02:27:08.437]  They dropped a sky on them, and that's exactly what they've done.
[02:27:08.437 --> 02:27:17.425]  Well, the law firms in this Wall Street Journal article, they were actually having victories five years ago, and they first discovered robo-signing four years ago, but it didn't get any news attention.
[02:27:17.705 --> 02:27:18.326]  Right.
[02:27:18.326 --> 02:27:27.395]  But now people are taking what these law firms have done successfully and duplicating it, and as Mr. Zaks said, they are finding even more types of fraud.
[02:27:27.395 --> 02:27:28.396]  Just like you said.
[02:27:28.396 --> 02:27:28.616]  Right.
[02:27:28.616 --> 02:27:34.402]  We have a recent case in California, one in Nevada, Arizona, and Tennessee.
[02:27:34.402 --> 02:27:35.663]  It started in Tennessee.
[02:27:35.663 --> 02:27:37.165]  There was a new one this week.
[02:27:37.165 --> 02:27:39.347]  This one was a Quitam action.
[02:27:40.472 --> 02:27:46.055]  Quitam is a suit to recover funds that were defrauded from the government.
[02:27:46.055 --> 02:27:51.217]  You file a quitam, if you win, you get to keep 25% of what you recover.
[02:27:51.217 --> 02:27:55.339]  Unless the government steps in and takes over, in which case you only get to keep 10.
[02:27:55.339 --> 02:28:01.903]  What the guy claimed was, is all of these sales of the security instrument had not been filed with the clerk of the court.
[02:28:03.018 --> 02:28:11.082]  He sued in Tennessee and named every court clerk in the state of Tennessee as a plaintiff.
[02:28:11.082 --> 02:28:16.905]  Claimed $34 million in fees not rendered to those clerks.
[02:28:16.905 --> 02:28:21.247]  Guy in Arizona, Nevada, and now in California picked it up.
[02:28:21.247 --> 02:28:24.749]  Guy in California also claimed the $5,000 to $10,000 fines for not filing.
[02:28:28.038 --> 02:28:31.645]  So, this is really bringing them serious problems.
[02:28:31.645 --> 02:28:32.867]  Now, do they have standing?
[02:28:32.867 --> 02:28:34.309]  I mean, were they the ones being foreclosed on?
[02:28:34.864 --> 02:28:38.866]  No, under a QUITAM action, it's the Whistleblower Act.
[02:28:38.866 --> 02:28:40.606]  It's like a bounty against corruption.
[02:28:40.606 --> 02:28:41.007]  Exactly.
[02:28:41.007 --> 02:28:49.630]  If you can find any government agency or official that's misappropriating public funds, you can sue under a QUITAM action to recover those funds.
[02:28:49.630 --> 02:29:00.835]  And they use a kind of twisted QUITAM then, correct me if I'm wrong, when they give, you know, the police a percentage of drug money seized, or citizens get part of stuff from a criminal action, but that's against citizens.
[02:29:01.095 --> 02:29:03.400]  That's absolutely twisted.
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:08.431]  That has been a good portion of what's turned this country into a police state.
[02:29:09.565 --> 02:29:11.266]  But that's for a different show.
[02:29:11.266 --> 02:29:15.988]  We are definitely in a police state, and it's getting worse, but we have opportunity here.
[02:29:15.988 --> 02:29:26.832]  Well, I want to get back into all this, but you were involved in a case here in Austin, and we sent some cameras down this weekend dealing with a high-powered Republican, Tom DeLay.
[02:29:26.832 --> 02:29:31.314]  And I want to hear about that due process issue, because that's how you first got into studying the law.
[02:29:31.314 --> 02:29:32.635]  Then we'll get into the mortgages, Randy.
[02:29:33.895 --> 02:29:35.396]  I'll go through this quickly.
[02:29:35.396 --> 02:29:36.817]  We're going to break.
[02:29:36.817 --> 02:29:38.137]  Long segment coming up.
[02:29:38.137 --> 02:29:40.919]  So we'll get into Tom DeLay and what's happening there.
[02:29:40.919 --> 02:29:44.920]  Not that Tom DeLay's a good guy, but he's having his due process rights violated.
[02:29:44.920 --> 02:29:46.801]  They can violate his, they can violate ours.
[02:29:46.801 --> 02:29:49.102]  We'll talk about Randy involved with that case straight ahead.
[02:29:49.102 --> 02:29:50.583]  Then we'll get into the mortgages.
[02:29:50.583 --> 02:29:52.064]  Stay with us.
[02:29:52.064 --> 02:29:53.444]  We're on the march.
[02:29:53.444 --> 02:29:55.966]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.966 --> 02:29:58.667]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:03.340 --> 02:30:05.923]  And you're subject to public police action.
[02:30:05.923 --> 02:30:07.184]  Tyranny is here.
[02:30:07.184 --> 02:30:11.048]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:30:11.048 --> 02:30:13.350]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:30:13.350 --> 02:30:19.216]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:30:19.216 --> 02:30:25.463]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:30:25.863 --> 02:30:31.828]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:30:31.828 --> 02:30:36.031]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:30:36.031 --> 02:30:40.315]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:30:40.315 --> 02:30:46.280]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:30:46.280 --> 02:30:49.823]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:30:49.823 --> 02:30:51.804]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:30:51.804 --> 02:30:52.245]  It's here.

[02:32:02.719 --> 02:32:06.721]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:06.721 --> 02:32:09.962]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.962 --> 02:32:14.744]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:32:14.744 --> 02:32:21.147]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:21.147 --> 02:32:23.388]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.928 --> 02:32:24.228]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:24.228 --> 02:32:24.748]  Bernanke?
[02:32:24.748 --> 02:32:25.428]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:25.428 --> 02:32:26.509]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:26.509 --> 02:32:28.949]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.833 --> 02:32:44.974]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:32:44.974 --> 02:32:50.115]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:50.115 --> 02:33:03.518]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:03.518 --> 02:33:05.219]  Big Brother.
[02:33:05.219 --> 02:33:06.399]  Mainstream media.
[02:33:07.569 --> 02:33:09.333]  Government cover-ups.
[02:33:09.333 --> 02:33:11.438]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:11.438 --> 02:33:13.562]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:13.562 --> 02:33:18.273]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.636 --> 02:33:30.879]  We're going to talk about the Tom DeLay situation of due process, then spend the balance of the next hour and a half going live into the fourth hour with Randy Kelton.
[02:33:30.879 --> 02:33:34.380]  Because this mortgage fraud affects everybody, we're going to run the gamut of it.
[02:33:34.380 --> 02:33:36.840]  Next hour, we're going to have to go ahead and clear the phone lines now.
[02:33:36.840 --> 02:33:42.562]  It's going to be wide open phones specifically for mortgage fraud questions to get Randy's take on it.
[02:33:42.562 --> 02:33:46.703]  He's got over 200 cases and is having a 95 plus percent success rate.
[02:33:47.103 --> 02:34:02.854]  So far we'll talk about that and they're teaching folks how to pro se yourselves go out doesn't mean it's a hundred percent or a silver bullet but at least you got a fighting chance because the courts are corrupt but we're gaining ground okay and resistance is victory or you could just roll over to them.
[02:34:03.871 --> 02:34:09.854]  Before I go any further, I want to tell you about a few of our great sponsors.
[02:34:09.854 --> 02:34:12.515]  Number one, I want to get into Diamond Gusset.

[02:34:27.623 --> 02:34:28.804]  These folks are running a special.

[02:34:53.394 --> 02:34:55.355]  Link on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:56.375 --> 02:35:00.640]  And also I want to tell you about Safe Castle LLC.
[02:35:00.640 --> 02:35:06.586]  I'm proud to welcome this great sponsor, a company in the preparedness field, Safe Castle LLC.

[02:35:15.614 --> 02:35:22.976]  On the web, you can also get to their store site from PrisonPlanet.com banner, where you can see their ad on the right-hand side of the page.
[02:35:22.976 --> 02:35:26.217]  These folks have been in the readiness business for 10 years.
[02:35:26.217 --> 02:35:29.618]  They're fond of saying that they are in the business of steel-plated peace of mind.
[02:35:29.618 --> 02:35:33.199]  They sell everything you need and more to be ready for what's coming down the pike.
[02:35:33.199 --> 02:35:38.821]  Survival gear, supplies, and even steel-plated underground shelters, ways to hide your guns, safe rooms.
[02:35:38.821 --> 02:35:39.721]  Tell them I sent you.
[02:35:39.721 --> 02:35:43.722]  Again, that's www.prepared.pro for professional crisis
[02:35:44.482 --> 02:35:44.802]  I don't
[02:36:04.711 --> 02:36:10.452]  But it shows the power of state prosecutors, grand juries, that they were really going after corruption.
[02:36:10.452 --> 02:36:11.253]  But they didn't do that.
[02:36:11.253 --> 02:36:12.673]  And you've studied the case.
[02:36:12.673 --> 02:36:14.213]  They didn't follow due process.
[02:36:14.213 --> 02:36:16.494]  You've looked at the charges.
[02:36:16.494 --> 02:36:19.575]  But he was removed from his leadership position.
[02:36:19.575 --> 02:36:23.816]  And you were down there at the courthouse covering this just two days ago in Austin.
[02:36:23.816 --> 02:36:25.516]  So, briefly, tell folks about that.
[02:36:25.516 --> 02:36:25.816]  OK.
[02:36:25.816 --> 02:36:28.277]  Tom DeLay was taken out of office by Ron Earl.
[02:36:29.048 --> 02:36:31.752]  District Attorney of Travis County, Texas.
[02:36:31.752 --> 02:36:44.809]  A local district attorney took out the Speaker of the House and the way he did it is he went to a grand jury with an indictment and asked the grand jury to approve the indictment.
[02:36:46.001 --> 02:36:47.862]  That is absolutely forbidden.
[02:36:47.862 --> 02:37:01.331]  Kennedy v. State says, in order to avoid the obvious evils of the accumulation of power in any one office, for the purpose of filing a criminal complaint, a prosecutor is not a credible person.
[02:37:01.331 --> 02:37:06.954]  We fought a revolution to keep the government from being the accuser and the prosecutor.
[02:37:07.014 --> 02:37:17.899]  You've got three different branches of government and you can't have prosecutors, as happened in the lead up to the war in 1776, becoming demigods, prosecuting their political enemies, you name it.
[02:37:17.899 --> 02:37:20.741]  And that is exactly what happened here.
[02:37:20.741 --> 02:37:27.784]  Ron Earle's problem is, is he tried too hard and he created the avenue for his own downfall.
[02:37:27.784 --> 02:37:29.965]  Or the downfall of what he created.
[02:37:29.965 --> 02:37:33.187]  He went to the grand jury and asked them to approve an indictment.
[02:37:34.036 --> 02:37:43.386]  27-004 government code says that, I'm sorry, 27-004, the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, duties of the grand jurors.
[02:37:43.386 --> 02:37:51.514]  The grand jury shall examine into all criminal accusations that come to their knowledge by way of the prosecution attorney or any credible person.
[02:37:51.514 --> 02:37:52.715]  Problem.
[02:37:52.715 --> 02:37:56.239]  A criminal accusation is a criminal complaint.
[02:37:57.574 --> 02:37:59.878]  So he made the original complaint.
[02:37:59.878 --> 02:38:03.605]  Complaints are made by someone else, then the prosecutor looks at it.
[02:38:03.605 --> 02:38:06.571]  The prosecutor can't be the complainant and the deliverer.
[02:38:06.571 --> 02:38:07.312]  Exactly.
[02:38:07.312 --> 02:38:07.974]  He's forbidden.
[02:38:08.829 --> 02:38:16.135]  The only thing that gives the grand jury jurisdiction is a criminal affidavit filed by some credible person.
[02:38:16.135 --> 02:38:17.997]  And that's the habeas corpus?
[02:38:17.997 --> 02:38:21.220]  No, this is a straight criminal complaint, just like a ticket.
[02:38:21.220 --> 02:38:24.683]  No, I know, but if they can't show that, I mean, where's the original complaint?
[02:38:24.683 --> 02:38:25.183]  Exactly.
[02:38:25.183 --> 02:38:26.665]  This is what I said to Tom.
[02:38:26.665 --> 02:38:28.406]  I put the writ in his hand.
[02:38:28.406 --> 02:38:30.808]  I filed it two years ago in the court.
[02:38:30.808 --> 02:38:32.710]  The judge refused to hear it and threw it out.
[02:38:33.979 --> 02:38:40.124]  Tom DeLay's attorney, Dick DeGaran, called me and said, did you file a writ habeas corpus in this case?
[02:38:40.124 --> 02:38:40.564]  Yes, I did.
[02:38:40.564 --> 02:38:41.225]  I know Dick DeGaran.
[02:38:41.225 --> 02:38:42.686]  I've interviewed him.
[02:38:42.686 --> 02:38:46.869]  He said, well, I'm the attorney of record and I didn't authorize you to file that.
[02:38:46.869 --> 02:38:48.911]  Well, I didn't need your authorization.
[02:38:48.911 --> 02:38:49.832]  I have a right to do it.
[02:38:49.832 --> 02:38:50.913]  Besides, you should have done it.
[02:38:50.913 --> 02:38:54.496]  What were you doing when they were trouncing all over all these rights?
[02:38:54.496 --> 02:38:55.777]  He hung up on me.
[02:38:55.777 --> 02:38:55.997]  Really?
[02:38:57.079 --> 02:39:07.285]  He, I felt like I stepped in his milk, but this was a special study that I had done because everybody's getting railroaded through the system.
[02:39:07.285 --> 02:39:09.486]  I mentioned a police state earlier.
[02:39:09.486 --> 02:39:11.687]  Would you recognize a police state if you were in one?
[02:39:11.687 --> 02:39:14.409]  Well, see, that's the power of a pro se litigant.
[02:39:14.409 --> 02:39:20.973]  As you said, once you're lawyers in that bar, they're not supposed to communicate with somebody else's client, but you're a private citizen.
[02:39:20.973 --> 02:39:21.773]  I'm a private citizen.
[02:39:21.773 --> 02:39:22.534]  That's my right.
[02:39:23.294 --> 02:39:41.299]  And the problem Ron Earl has in creating this prosecution against Tom DeLay illegally is after that, when I filed a writ of habeas corpus for a kid in Montgomery County with the Court of Criminal Appeals, and they denied me permission to file.
[02:39:41.299 --> 02:39:43.880]  Well, they didn't have authority to grant or deny permission.
[02:39:43.880 --> 02:39:45.600]  It's a writ of right.
[02:39:45.600 --> 02:39:48.001]  I filed criminal charges with a grand jury.
[02:39:48.001 --> 02:39:51.162]  Well, Ron Earl, in his standard chicanery,
[02:39:51.994 --> 02:40:05.109]  In an effort to get rid of all of these judges, as they were all Republicans, and he's a Democrat, and he wasn't running again, he actually gave my complaints against these judges to the grand jury.
[02:40:05.109 --> 02:40:10.576]  All of the judges, the 15 judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals, I almost got them about two years ago.
[02:40:11.820 --> 02:40:13.561]  But he opened the door.
[02:40:13.561 --> 02:40:21.243]  Well, briefly, before we get back into the mortgages, what's the process right now with this individual?
[02:40:21.243 --> 02:40:33.007]  Well, I filed a writ and the judge told me, I stood up in court and stopped the court telling them that I have business with this court and it supersedes any business currently before the court.
[02:40:33.007 --> 02:40:33.767]  And Judge Dietz
[02:40:34.665 --> 02:40:38.328]  District Judge Dietz said, oh, you're the guy with the writ of habeas corpus.
[02:40:38.328 --> 02:40:41.411]  I'm not going to waste all these good people's time with that nonsense.
[02:40:41.411 --> 02:40:42.752]  You are not to say another word.
[02:40:42.752 --> 02:40:44.654]  Get out of my courtroom.
[02:40:44.654 --> 02:40:47.556]  I looked around for the bailiff and I couldn't find him.
[02:40:47.556 --> 02:40:54.122]  I had made the mistake earlier of telling him that if this judge refused to hear the writ, I was going to ask the bailiff to arrest the judge.
[02:40:55.060 --> 02:40:58.043]  Well, the bailiff chickened out and hit the road.
[02:40:58.043 --> 02:41:09.814]  So, I left the courtroom and now I will be filing against Judge Dietz with the grand jury and we'll see if he's as arrogant when I get him in front of a grand jury as he was in that courtroom.
[02:41:09.814 --> 02:41:14.378]  But specifically, where is Tom DeLay in the process right now?
[02:41:14.378 --> 02:41:16.660]  I put this writ in Tom DeLay's hand.
[02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:17.461]  Now he knows.
[02:41:18.502 --> 02:41:26.029]  That this local prosecuting attorney took him out of office absolutely illegally.
[02:41:26.029 --> 02:41:29.392]  I suspect Tom DeLay is really unhappy right now.
[02:41:29.392 --> 02:41:34.977]  Now I'll say this on the air, I have no compassion or love for Tom DeLay.
[02:41:34.977 --> 02:41:35.778]  He's a politician.
[02:41:37.250 --> 02:41:43.052]  The purpose was his due process rights were being violated like everyone else's.
[02:41:43.052 --> 02:41:55.978]  If he realizes how dangerous this corrupt situation is, the problem all these corrupt politicians have is they can't protect themselves from one another.
[02:41:55.978 --> 02:42:00.980]  If he goes to the Republican Party and they realize how vulnerable every one of them are,
[02:42:01.852 --> 02:42:09.987]  We could well get them to come down and put pressure to stop this practice, in which case they'll open the door for you and I.
[02:42:10.737 --> 02:42:18.361]  To go down with criminal complaints against public officials, get them in front of grand juries, and that will change everything.
[02:42:18.361 --> 02:42:22.883]  And of course, grand juries, you have the ballot box, you have the jury box, the grand jury box.
[02:42:22.883 --> 02:42:28.787]  If you go back 50 years ago, grand juries were pretty much independent and very powerful and represented the people.
[02:42:28.787 --> 02:42:35.670]  Now, they've been turned into creatures of the prosecutors, but just because they operate like they own them, doesn't mean that that's legal or legitimate.
[02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:38.852]  But my question is, where is Tom DeLay in his cases right now?
[02:42:40.385 --> 02:42:43.607]  He hasn't contacted me since I gave him the documentation.
[02:42:43.607 --> 02:42:44.747]  No, but where is his case?
[02:42:44.747 --> 02:42:51.371]  Oh, his case, they're in jury selection right now and they're trying to prosecute him for a felony.
[02:42:51.371 --> 02:42:53.292]  So he didn't take a deal.
[02:42:53.292 --> 02:42:54.773]  And you've looked at the case?
[02:42:54.773 --> 02:42:57.194]  He was not guilty of it?
[02:42:57.194 --> 02:43:03.157]  Whether he's guilty or not, I'm not sure, but from reading the case, there's nothing in the case that would indicate it.
[02:43:03.157 --> 02:43:05.198]  And what are they claiming he did?
[02:43:05.198 --> 02:43:07.620]  Oh, they're claiming he took money under the table.
[02:43:08.484 --> 02:43:14.009]  And then took that money and invested it in different ventures of his own.
[02:43:14.009 --> 02:43:17.852]  But they, from what I could see, it was iffy at best.
[02:43:17.852 --> 02:43:24.918]  The fact that Tom DeLay is willing to take this to court, he's pretty sure he's going to win it.
[02:43:24.918 --> 02:43:33.585]  But I suspect now, with the problems that the prosecutor's going to have maintaining due process, he's got a much bigger chance of winning it.
[02:43:34.673 --> 02:43:40.217]  But why isn't Tom DeLay bringing up the issue that the complaint was brought by a political opponent?
[02:43:40.217 --> 02:43:45.241]  Most likely his attorney has fed him a story.
[02:43:45.241 --> 02:43:46.442]  But I can't speculate.
[02:43:46.442 --> 02:43:48.823]  I've had Dick DeGaran on a few times.
[02:43:48.823 --> 02:43:49.884]  He defended the Waco folks.
[02:43:49.884 --> 02:43:51.425]  He's a pretty good guy.
[02:43:51.425 --> 02:43:52.006]  But he lost.
[02:43:54.128 --> 02:43:58.990]  Well, that's because the judge that ran the Waco operation was over the court.
[02:43:58.990 --> 02:44:02.271]  I mean, the judge that was over the criminal trial was over the civil.
[02:44:02.271 --> 02:44:03.151]  I didn't understand.
[02:44:03.151 --> 02:44:06.452]  I had heard good about Dick DeGaran.
[02:44:06.452 --> 02:44:14.475]  I didn't understand why he didn't look at this and say, this is an absolute open door to get this thrown out.
[02:44:14.475 --> 02:44:19.497]  Unless he had a strategy I didn't know about, which was bring this up at trial.
[02:44:20.618 --> 02:44:23.980]  And force a dismissal at trial, that way they can't come back after it.
[02:44:23.980 --> 02:44:28.642]  And that might be why he's mad at you for disclosing his secret weapon.
[02:44:28.642 --> 02:44:30.243]  He could have told me.
[02:44:30.243 --> 02:44:33.245]  Well, he doesn't know you're out there, Randy.
[02:44:33.245 --> 02:44:35.446]  I really didn't care about his position.
[02:44:35.446 --> 02:44:35.966]  No, I understand.
[02:44:35.966 --> 02:44:38.748]  You're just pointing out the due process and how they're violating that.
[02:44:38.748 --> 02:44:43.110]  I'm concerned about what they're doing to you and me and everybody.
[02:44:43.110 --> 02:44:46.352]  In Texas, average conviction rate, 99.6.
[02:44:50.478 --> 02:44:53.820]  Would you recognize a police state if you were in one?
[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:59.703]  The United States houses approximately 3% of the world's population.
[02:44:59.703 --> 02:45:03.866]  It houses approximately 50% of the world's population of inmates.
[02:45:03.866 --> 02:45:08.128]  Would you recognize a police state if you were in one?
[02:45:08.128 --> 02:45:14.052]  This is the worst police state the world has ever seen, and we don't have a clue.
[02:45:14.052 --> 02:45:15.493]  That's why I'm going after this.
[02:45:16.513 --> 02:45:23.158]  Well it is crazy how they selectively prosecute innocent people and then leave corrupt people alone.
[02:45:23.158 --> 02:45:26.160]  Have you heard about this Jack Conway case?
[02:45:26.160 --> 02:45:31.204]  Where his brother is a prosecutor, he's the Attorney General of Kentucky, running against Rand Paul.
[02:45:31.204 --> 02:45:36.227]  And they were going to SWAT team his brother for reported narcotics trafficking and usage, that was the alleged thing.
[02:45:37.768 --> 02:45:49.456]  The head narcotics officer warned his brother, and then warned Conway, and then his brother, and the detectives lied to other investigators, and now they admit all this in the newspaper, but it's not a big issue?
[02:45:49.456 --> 02:45:50.837]  That sounds like obstruction of justice.
[02:46:07.632 --> 02:46:10.415]  They wind up with criminal charges against them.
[02:46:10.415 --> 02:46:21.864]  We don't have any time on this show, but I have a whole process for going after one person and when someone steps in the way and tries to protect them, you forget the first and go for the second one.
[02:46:21.864 --> 02:46:26.108]  And eventually you want to go for a district judge and drag the district judge down to the grand jury.
[02:46:27.136 --> 02:46:35.986]  And when you get the district judge to the grand jury for protecting the district attorney from prosecution, the district judge is going to be really unhappy with the district.
[02:46:35.986 --> 02:46:41.892]  But how can they be in the newspaper admitting they lied and admitting they warned him and then they're not instantly indicted?
[02:46:41.892 --> 02:46:44.295]  They're not afraid of us.
[02:46:44.295 --> 02:46:47.838]  Thomas Jefferson said, when the people fear the government, there is tyranny.
[02:46:49.228 --> 02:46:51.349]  When the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:46:51.349 --> 02:46:53.249]  The government does not yet fear the people.
[02:46:53.249 --> 02:46:55.310]  Well, that's like these mortgages, and now we'll start getting into that.
[02:46:55.310 --> 02:47:03.172]  I mean, with these mortgages, they're just out in the open, Randy, like that lawyer said, just engaged in total fraud, and they know it.
[02:47:03.172 --> 02:47:05.852]  Yes, they bought the courts.
[02:47:05.852 --> 02:47:10.993]  And what I tell people when I present this, courts are absolutely corrupt.
[02:47:10.993 --> 02:47:16.275]  You sue in the court, you sue pro se, they're going to rule against you at every turn.
[02:47:16.275 --> 02:47:17.135]  You have to expect that.
[02:47:18.359 --> 02:47:19.760]  They are so corrupt.
[02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:22.903]  But why are people having victory though, even though that's happening?
[02:47:22.903 --> 02:47:27.387]  You're forcing them to fight it, and they've got so many things they're stealing, they don't have time to deal with it.
[02:47:27.387 --> 02:47:31.411]  But then if you go back at them and sue them, but I mean, look at these cases here, Randy.
[02:47:31.411 --> 02:47:32.752]  It's all over the Wall Street Journal.
[02:47:32.752 --> 02:47:34.654]  They're winning these cases against the banks.
[02:47:34.654 --> 02:47:37.697]  Here's the problem with the guys who bought the judges.
[02:47:37.697 --> 02:47:41.060]  The judges are so corrupt, they can't even trust them.
[02:47:42.574 --> 02:47:45.636]  Politics, there's three kinds of power.
[02:47:45.636 --> 02:47:48.817]  Politics, money, and votes.
[02:47:48.817 --> 02:47:49.898]  And guns.
[02:47:49.898 --> 02:47:51.779]  And guns.
[02:47:51.779 --> 02:47:56.682]  Right now, votes are becoming the big issue for the politicians.
[02:47:56.682 --> 02:48:05.326]  The politicians are exerting influence on the courts, and the courts are betraying the ones that bought them.
[02:48:05.326 --> 02:48:07.668]  And they're setting a precedent for down the road.
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:16.446]  Once this election is over, every member of the House of Representatives is up for election, they're going in with an 11% approval rating.
[02:48:16.446 --> 02:48:18.467]  They can hear the toilet flushing.
[02:48:18.467 --> 02:48:37.641]  They're doing everything they can to distract the public from them and get them looking at some other enemy, while the politicians who created this mess put on a show of trying to do something to clean it up, just long enough for us to vote for them so they can go back to business as usual.
[02:48:38.564 --> 02:48:43.547]  The problem is, once they open this legal door, they set the precedent.
[02:48:43.547 --> 02:48:46.669]  They get this train on the track, and they can't get it off.
[02:48:46.669 --> 02:48:54.813]  The precedent for banks to take anybody's property they want is one precedent, or the precedent that people started to win, and now people understand it's a fraud.
[02:48:54.813 --> 02:49:02.778]  Yes, and I read some figures on the judges' retirement funds are also invested in these
[02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:11.991]  Consumer mortgages, the funds' values have went from $6.8 billion to $2.3 billion in the last four years.
[02:49:11.991 --> 02:49:13.453]  So the judges have been robbed?
[02:49:13.453 --> 02:49:17.939]  So now the judges are realizing that they screwed themselves.
[02:49:17.939 --> 02:49:21.183]  And now they need to do something to find a way to recover.
[02:49:22.190 --> 02:49:31.760]  And we have a number of unions and other retirement investment funds that are suing the lenders to try to recover some of these monies that they've lost.
[02:49:31.760 --> 02:49:33.782]  Okay, we've given some of the basics.
[02:49:33.782 --> 02:49:39.668]  In the next few segments, I want you to go through your document cam presentation, but we're about to go to break.
[02:49:39.668 --> 02:49:41.250]  We've got the free video streams again today.
[02:49:41.570 --> 02:49:41.690]  Yes.
[02:50:06.658 --> 02:50:11.162]  The Glass-Steagall Act was the start.
[02:50:11.162 --> 02:50:23.452]  In the 80s and 90s, Bush and then, first Clinton and then Bush, removed the Glass-Steagall Act and another act that protected borrowers from the lenders.
[02:50:23.452 --> 02:50:30.738]  Well, under the guise of making housing available to the poor, they took these protections off and about the same time they started securitizing notes.
[02:50:32.073 --> 02:50:38.485]  Well, this created an opportunity for people to go into business as mortgage companies, and they didn't care about the mortgage.
[02:50:38.485 --> 02:50:39.808]  They create the mortgage and sell it.
[02:50:39.808 --> 02:50:41.491]  They get their money, take profit, walk away.
[02:50:43.322 --> 02:50:46.944]  So it made it profitable to sell these to investors.
[02:50:46.944 --> 02:50:51.348]  And the more expensive the loan product, the more profit they made.
[02:50:51.348 --> 02:50:56.711]  All right, we're going to explain all this and then get into all the facts, figures, and numbers.
[02:50:56.711 --> 02:50:57.972]  Folks, the mortgages are nothing.
[02:50:57.972 --> 02:51:00.254]  That's just the beginning, the root of the fraud.
[02:51:00.254 --> 02:51:01.915]  We're going to look at this whole tree coming up.
[02:51:06.423 --> 02:51:07.684]  Tyranny is here.
[02:51:07.684 --> 02:51:11.606]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:51:11.606 --> 02:51:13.848]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:51:13.848 --> 02:51:19.711]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:51:19.711 --> 02:51:25.955]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:51:26.375 --> 02:51:32.318]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:51:32.318 --> 02:51:36.540]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:40.822]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:51:40.822 --> 02:51:46.765]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[02:51:46.765 --> 02:51:50.327]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:51:50.327 --> 02:51:52.288]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:51:52.288 --> 02:51:52.728]  It's here.

[02:52:16.156 --> 02:52:18.599]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[02:52:28.085 --> 02:52:29.966]  There is no other program of its kind.

[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:31.921]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:53:31.921 --> 02:53:36.484]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:53:36.484 --> 02:53:42.288]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:53:42.288 --> 02:53:45.930]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:53:45.930 --> 02:53:48.652]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:48.652 --> 02:53:53.715]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[02:53:53.715 --> 02:53:53.956]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:53.956 --> 02:53:55.357]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:54:05.462 --> 02:54:14.025]  Okay, so we're delving deep into the mortgage fraud, which is only one piece of the larger banking takeover.
[02:54:14.025 --> 02:54:19.947]  Randy's a pro-state litigant having a lot of big success keeping people in their houses, teaching them how to defend themselves.
[02:54:19.947 --> 02:54:21.927]  That's the secret, because you heard the law firm earlier.
[02:54:21.927 --> 02:54:24.008]  They got more business than they can even take.
[02:54:24.008 --> 02:54:26.469]  And there's other law firms learning, other individuals learning.
[02:54:26.989 --> 02:54:30.630]  You know, how to demand due process, how to not just be rolled over.
[02:54:30.630 --> 02:54:36.032]  And by everybody resisting, or even a small percentage resisting, that's already brought them to a grinding halt.
[02:54:36.032 --> 02:54:41.094]  Randy, on the document cam for PrisonPlanet.TV viewers, we're going to be going over these charts and graphs.
[02:54:41.094 --> 02:54:42.835]  We've got a free video link.
[02:54:42.835 --> 02:54:45.656]  It's what everybody gets every day if they're a PrisonPlanet.TV member.
[02:54:45.656 --> 02:54:47.376]  Adds a whole new dimension to the show.
[02:54:47.376 --> 02:54:49.097]  What's this first graph we've got here?
[02:54:49.097 --> 02:54:54.159]  This first graph is a graph of housing prices for the last hundred years.
[02:54:55.563 --> 02:55:02.349]  And you can see there was a rather large drop around the turn of the century.
[02:55:02.349 --> 02:55:14.760]  The last two peaks, there was a peak in the 20s, a peak in the 40s, then it dropped down, and in the year 2000, the graph went almost straight up.
[02:55:15.984 --> 02:55:18.125]  And there's a reason for that.
[02:55:18.125 --> 02:55:23.786]  We can go back, and it's hard to see on the graph, but there's a drop-down in 1907.
[02:55:23.786 --> 02:55:33.268]  And that drop-down was caused because people were allowed to bet on stocks, whether they would increase or decrease, without actually purchasing the stock.
[02:55:33.268 --> 02:55:35.429]  That was called derivatives.
[02:55:35.429 --> 02:55:39.670]  It caused the stock market crash in 1907, so the legislature forbade it.
[02:55:39.670 --> 02:55:41.470]  That's right here.
[02:55:41.470 --> 02:55:43.531]  They forbade the practice, made it a felony.
[02:55:45.208 --> 02:55:46.373]  Until the year 2000.
[02:55:48.507 --> 02:55:51.850]  The year 2000, they removed that restriction.
[02:55:51.850 --> 02:56:01.897]  So with the Glass-Steagall Act gone, and government oversight of the lenders is non-existent, they essentially unleashed the money changers on us.
[02:56:01.897 --> 02:56:16.148]  Convincing everybody to do the one thing that had always been forbidden, and to speculate on their home, and to take their good stable loans in which they were building equity, and trade them in for speculative loans that they would possibly make a lot of money on.
[02:56:17.521 --> 02:56:22.483]  But in the end, something else could happen, which they didn't tell him about.
[02:56:22.483 --> 02:56:30.906]  And the easiest way to visualize is to turn that graph upside down, because that's what has actually happened to the lending industry.
[02:56:30.906 --> 02:56:41.710]  That's a graph of property sales, which reflects property prices.
[02:56:41.710 --> 02:56:42.810]  We'll get prices in a second.
[02:56:44.747 --> 02:56:47.508]  Since 2008 is where the graph starts down.
[02:56:47.508 --> 02:56:50.910]  Or that was 2007, it starts down.
[02:56:50.910 --> 02:56:55.912]  This one ends at 2008 and it's done nothing but get worse since.
[02:56:55.912 --> 02:56:57.473]  Let's go to the one in the back.
[02:56:57.473 --> 02:56:59.594]  This one.
[02:56:59.594 --> 02:57:10.079]  This is an indication, this is a graph of percent homeowners with mortgage negative equity by state.
[02:57:10.079 --> 02:57:12.160]  The very first state there is Nevada.
[02:57:13.544 --> 02:57:17.947]  From Nevada we go to Arizona, Florida, Michigan, California.
[02:57:17.947 --> 02:57:21.990]  Michigan, if you go to Detroit, it looks like a war zone.
[02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:22.630]  We've been there.
[02:57:22.630 --> 02:57:23.631]  It looks like...
[02:57:26.840 --> 02:57:27.961]  I mean, I can't even describe it.
[02:57:27.961 --> 02:57:34.169]  It looks like one of those movies where everybody's dead on the planet, kind of like I Am Legend or something, and there's just nobody there.
[02:57:34.169 --> 02:57:35.291]  Nobody there.
[02:57:35.291 --> 02:57:36.793]  This is going to happen even more.
[02:57:36.793 --> 02:57:43.040]  What's happening right now is the banks are foreclosing on so many homes, they can't sell them.
[02:57:43.905 --> 02:57:45.325]  They have to take them back.
[02:57:45.325 --> 02:57:54.007]  They can't sell them into the market because it'll drive the prices of housing down so much that the housing industry will collapse completely.
[02:57:54.007 --> 02:57:59.968]  They already have every state with a good number of people upside down on their mortgages.
[02:57:59.968 --> 02:58:08.309]  If they repossess these houses and then put them back out there for sale, this graph will increase exponentially.
[02:58:08.309 --> 02:58:12.630]  What we're looking at is a major housing shortage very soon.
[02:58:13.570 --> 02:58:16.293]  Well, nobody's building houses now.
[02:58:16.293 --> 02:58:17.854]  All construction has ceased.
[02:58:17.854 --> 02:58:21.877]  The only construction that's going on is what's already been funded.
[02:58:21.877 --> 02:58:23.098]  Can't afford to build houses now.
[02:58:23.098 --> 02:58:26.822]  I have a number of friends, construction industry, it's completely shut down.
[02:58:26.822 --> 02:58:29.344]  No, it's down by over 90%.
[02:58:29.344 --> 02:58:32.967]  Likely to start destroying these houses because they can't afford to keep them.
[02:58:32.967 --> 02:58:38.092]  All right, we're going to come right back in one minute with the 4th Hour Live.
[02:58:38.092 --> 02:58:39.293]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:58:43.342 --> 02:58:46.894]  You are listening to GCN.
[02:58:46.894 --> 02:58:49.182]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.852 --> 02:58:56.415]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:58:56.415 --> 02:58:57.335]  Number 1.
[02:58:57.335 --> 02:59:00.758]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:59:00.758 --> 02:59:01.618]  Number 2.
[02:59:01.618 --> 02:59:06.501]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:59:06.501 --> 02:59:07.242]  It's true.
[02:59:07.242 --> 02:59:12.125]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:59:12.125 --> 02:59:12.945]  Number 3.
[02:59:12.945 --> 02:59:16.528]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:59:16.528 --> 02:59:20.230]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:59:20.430 --> 02:59:21.230]  Number 4.
[02:59:21.230 --> 02:59:23.992]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:59:23.992 --> 02:59:27.674]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:59:27.674 --> 02:59:28.454]  Number 5.
[02:59:28.454 --> 02:59:32.596]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:59:32.596 --> 02:59:37.659]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:59:37.659 --> 02:59:41.841]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:41.841 --> 02:59:43.622]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:59:43.622 --> 02:59:48.224]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:59:48.524 --> 02:59:48.804]  877-327-0365.
[02:59:48.804 --> 02:59:54.313]  Coast to Coast.
[02:59:54.313 --> 02:59:56.356]  Direct from Austin.
[02:59:56.356 --> 02:59:59.580]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:09.372 --> 03:00:15.234]  One of the other stories up at Infowars.com has been broken by the drugs report today.
[03:00:15.234 --> 03:00:25.097]  George Bush's new book, he admits he gave the order to basically shoot down flight 93, which is what all the witnesses said they'd seen, but he claims then it just crashed on its own.
[03:00:25.097 --> 03:00:30.979]  Side issue, but that's the type of important stuff up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:00:30.979 --> 03:00:31.679]  Randy Kelton
[03:00:32.459 --> 03:00:40.282]  You know, really a mortgage fraud analyst, somebody that breaks this down and then kind of collates the different systems that are working against it, joins us.
[03:00:40.282 --> 03:00:42.483]  And I thought I should plug one of your websites.
[03:00:42.483 --> 03:00:46.084]  It's just a basic contact point for folks that want more information.
[03:00:46.084 --> 03:00:48.425]  And it's mortgagecrimes.com.
[03:00:48.425 --> 03:00:50.846]  Yes, and just a quick comment on Flight 93.
[03:00:50.846 --> 03:00:55.367]  The guy called with a cell phone from the airplane.
[03:00:55.367 --> 03:00:59.309]  I tried to call a friend of mine from the top of the Empire State Building.
[03:00:59.309 --> 03:01:00.189]  I couldn't get a signal.
[03:01:01.852 --> 03:01:04.633]  When I went to the bottom of the Empire State Building, I could get in.
[03:01:04.633 --> 03:01:10.334]  Now cell phones don't work over about 2,000 feet, and of course they claim they worked at 35,000 feet that day.
[03:01:10.334 --> 03:01:11.955]  Yes, that was absolute nonsense.
[03:01:11.955 --> 03:01:13.715]  And then it turned out it was, but yeah.
[03:01:13.715 --> 03:01:15.696]  Okay, so what's this new graph we've got here?
[03:01:15.696 --> 03:01:21.878]  This is a graph of the number of foreclosures by month.
[03:01:21.878 --> 03:01:27.139]  Right at the end, you see it appears to go down, and they've been talking about, oh, it's getting better, there are less foreclosures.
[03:01:27.139 --> 03:01:28.980]  That's because this modification scam.
[03:01:30.250 --> 03:01:33.213]  They instituted this modification.
[03:01:33.213 --> 03:01:35.194]  We'll modify your loan for you.
[03:01:35.194 --> 03:01:39.018]  So, it takes two or three months to get through the modification issue.
[03:01:39.018 --> 03:01:41.159]  That's why it looks like it's down.
[03:01:41.159 --> 03:01:41.340]  Well...
[03:01:42.506 --> 03:01:45.529]  People are finding out that the modification is a setup.
[03:01:45.529 --> 03:01:51.235]  You ask for a modification, they say, oh sure, but we can't modify unless you're a couple of payments behind.
[03:01:51.235 --> 03:01:58.583]  And then when you get a couple of payments behind and start negotiating the modifications, you notice they accelerate your note and you ask them, what is this?
[03:01:58.583 --> 03:02:01.466]  Oh, don't worry about that, the modification will take care of it.
[03:02:01.466 --> 03:02:02.888]  Then you get a notice of foreclosure.
[03:02:03.684 --> 03:02:05.224]  Oh, they'll take care of that.
[03:02:05.224 --> 03:02:10.505]  The last thing they'll do is deny your modification and foreclose immediately.
[03:02:10.505 --> 03:02:16.766]  Or if they do give you a modification, it's supposed to lower your payments for a period of time and then come back up to where they were.
[03:02:16.766 --> 03:02:19.707]  It lowers your payments for a period of time and then they triple.
[03:02:19.707 --> 03:02:23.848]  Miss one payment after modification, they foreclose instantly.
[03:02:23.848 --> 03:02:26.288]  It's all a setup to force you into a foreclosure.
[03:02:26.288 --> 03:02:27.848]  It's a way to get you to waive your rights.
[03:02:27.848 --> 03:02:28.488]  Yeah.
[03:02:28.488 --> 03:02:31.749]  The only way the lender makes the big money
[03:02:32.589 --> 03:02:33.389]  Is to foreclose.
[03:02:33.389 --> 03:02:35.871]  He don't care about your property.
[03:02:35.871 --> 03:02:37.331]  Derivatives.
[03:02:37.331 --> 03:02:42.033]  He'll make 8 to 10 times the amount of your principal if he forecloses.
[03:02:42.033 --> 03:02:43.994]  All he wants to do is foreclose.
[03:02:43.994 --> 03:02:47.896]  After that, everything in this becomes a liability to him.
[03:02:47.896 --> 03:02:50.137]  And that's where we have an advantage.
[03:02:50.137 --> 03:02:55.159]  That's where we can take him to task and do something to stop all of this.
[03:02:55.159 --> 03:02:59.221]  The courts are turning against him because the politicians are in trouble.
[03:03:00.074 --> 03:03:03.555]  All of this is working to our benefit.
[03:03:03.555 --> 03:03:12.499]  If we don't do something quickly, this country will be forced into, by far, the worst depression it's ever seen.
[03:03:12.499 --> 03:03:23.703]  Because all of these sales of the security instrument, with no hard trace of where they've been, creates property nobody can invest in.
[03:03:23.703 --> 03:03:25.144]  When we can't get foreign investment,
[03:03:26.055 --> 03:03:30.198]  There's no way for us to come back out of this depression we're going into.
[03:03:30.198 --> 03:03:35.041]  So, we need to stop as many foreclosures as possible.
[03:03:35.041 --> 03:03:38.483]  Everybody here needs to stay in their houses.
[03:03:38.483 --> 03:03:42.085]  And the best way to do that is to sue them.
[03:03:42.085 --> 03:03:44.266]  The attorneys that were on before.
[03:03:44.266 --> 03:03:45.107]  Win, lose, or draw.
[03:03:45.107 --> 03:03:46.788]  You sue them, you win.
[03:03:47.918 --> 03:03:54.284]  They're going to lose, even if they win the House in the end, which is becoming very unlikely.
[03:03:54.284 --> 03:03:55.846]  No, no, they're losing them.
[03:03:55.846 --> 03:04:05.295]  They're failing because once they get into depositions, they go, yeah, we don't have the deed, or we didn't review the documents, or we charged too many fees, or yeah, we sold this over and over again.
[03:04:05.295 --> 03:04:06.936]  I mean, and then they're dead.
[03:04:06.936 --> 03:04:11.421]  Yes, we put together a program to help people get into court.
[03:04:12.270 --> 03:04:13.532]  Just sue him.
[03:04:13.532 --> 03:04:18.277]  The first one I did, someone came to me, you gotta do something, I'm gonna be thrown out in three days.
[03:04:18.277 --> 03:04:26.147]  I went on the internet, I used my most honed skill, plagiarized, I pulled down a bunch of suits with issues that matched this guy's issues.
[03:04:26.147 --> 03:04:28.189]  That was what, two and a half years ago?
[03:04:28.189 --> 03:04:28.750]  Last November.
[03:04:29.591 --> 03:04:30.931]  I've heard you for years talking about it.
[03:04:46.317 --> 03:04:52.687]  He filed his junk suit, and just two months ago, the lender came to him and said, well, you sued the wrong person.
[03:04:52.687 --> 03:04:53.788]  You should have sued this guy.
[03:04:53.788 --> 03:04:56.753]  Folks can contact you at Mortgage Crimes, with an S, right?
[03:04:56.753 --> 03:04:57.053]  Yes.

[03:05:04.880 --> 03:05:09.923]  You might have heard about Life Change T on a radio commercial or a TV commercial.

[03:05:12.104 --> 03:05:13.785]  You tuned out.
[03:05:13.785 --> 03:05:14.806]  I understand.
[03:05:14.806 --> 03:05:15.926]  Now the facts.
[03:05:15.926 --> 03:05:20.709]  When health fails, you will do just about anything for better health.
[03:05:21.209 --> 03:05:22.570]  So why wait?

[03:06:01.963 --> 03:06:06.926]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:06:06.926 --> 03:06:07.927]  What have we got?
[03:06:07.927 --> 03:06:10.368]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:06:10.368 --> 03:06:11.369]  A republic.
[03:06:11.369 --> 03:06:14.031]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:06:14.031 --> 03:06:16.292]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:06:16.292 --> 03:06:18.313]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:06:18.313 --> 03:06:19.994]  So they think they own our land?
[03:06:19.994 --> 03:06:21.315]  They think they own our water?
[03:06:21.315 --> 03:06:21.935]  Children?
[03:06:21.935 --> 03:06:23.056]  Our education?
[03:06:23.056 --> 03:06:23.877]  Our money?
[03:06:23.877 --> 03:06:27.519]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:06:27.899 --> 03:06:32.866]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:06:32.866 --> 03:06:33.887]  We have the facts.
[03:06:33.887 --> 03:06:35.049]  We have the Constitution.
[03:06:35.049 --> 03:06:35.950]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:06:35.950 --> 03:06:36.831]  We have common law.
[03:06:36.831 --> 03:06:39.375]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:39.375 --> 03:06:42.319]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[03:06:42.319 --> 03:06:43.140]  Rise of the Republic.
[03:06:43.240 --> 03:06:48.204]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:06:48.204 --> 03:06:49.706]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:06:49.706 --> 03:06:50.787]  Don't tread on me.
[03:06:50.787 --> 03:06:57.673]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:07:02.796 --> 03:07:06.799]  You may not be thinking of lead and brass as precious metal investments.
[03:07:06.799 --> 03:07:10.322]  And you may not be thinking about ammo when we say battery station.
[03:07:10.322 --> 03:07:11.423]  But you should!
[03:07:11.423 --> 03:07:15.306]  Because battery station has a large inventory of the most popular calibers.
[03:07:15.306 --> 03:07:18.649]  Just go to batterystation.com and click on ammunition.
[03:07:18.649 --> 03:07:22.372]  There, you'll see where Second Amendment patriots invest in precious metals for .380, 9mm,

[03:07:32.177 --> 03:07:37.380]  Be sure to look for the October GCN Specials in blue boxes, too, at BatteryStation.com.

[03:08:01.971 --> 03:08:07.373]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.373 --> 03:08:09.654]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:14.577 --> 03:08:17.841]  I see your phone calls, George, Mark, Bill, and others.
[03:08:17.841 --> 03:08:22.186]  You have a question for Randy Kelton starting in the next segment.
[03:08:22.186 --> 03:08:24.869]  We're going to go to your calls.
[03:08:24.869 --> 03:08:25.750]  1-800-259-9231.
[03:08:25.750 --> 03:08:27.832]  Now, just a few months ago, it was a fraud.
[03:08:27.832 --> 03:08:31.236]  It was a conspiracy theory to say, make them show you the note.
[03:08:31.917 --> 03:08:47.227]  Go after them for selling the note, for not having a proper chain of title, for selling it into derivatives, clouding your title, because you're supposedly paying in to finally own this house, and they've already sold it down the road to all these foreign countries and corporations.
[03:08:47.227 --> 03:08:50.309]  See, this affects everybody, not just people that are upside down.
[03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:55.592]  That's why they're taking houses that are paid for, or they don't even have a note for, because this was sold in derivatives.
[03:08:57.839 --> 03:09:10.027]  Just because lawyers and pro se's finally sued and busted all this open, they ceased many of the foreclosures because it's killing them and they're looking for a political remedy in Congress to tell them they're allowed to do all this.
[03:09:10.027 --> 03:09:15.431]  But then if Congress does do that, as they're signaling they are, then there's no private property left in this country.
[03:09:15.431 --> 03:09:18.393]  I mean, Randy, that's why I've been spending so much time on this.
[03:09:18.393 --> 03:09:19.774]  This is a big deal.
[03:09:19.774 --> 03:09:22.235]  This is THE deal.
[03:09:22.235 --> 03:09:25.418]  There's a good chance this country will come apart over all of this.
[03:09:26.417 --> 03:09:32.940]  And in terms of remedies, I may be suggesting something that would lead to that.
[03:09:32.940 --> 03:09:41.043]  If we're going to fix this problem, one of the things we do, I hate new legislation, but there is a little bit that we need.
[03:09:41.043 --> 03:09:47.446]  One of the things we need is statutes forbidding the paying of derivatives.
[03:09:47.446 --> 03:09:50.727]  We can't go back and undo what's been done.
[03:09:50.727 --> 03:09:51.648]  But we had that before 99.
[03:09:53.473 --> 03:09:56.314]  Yes, before 99 it was a felony to do that.
[03:09:56.314 --> 03:09:59.256]  We should stop the payment of all derivatives.
[03:09:59.256 --> 03:10:02.337]  These people have bought this as insurance.
[03:10:02.337 --> 03:10:03.738]  That's what Webster Tarpley says.
[03:10:03.738 --> 03:10:04.438]  Freeze them.
[03:10:04.438 --> 03:10:05.118]  They're fraud.
[03:10:05.118 --> 03:10:06.639]  They were induced through fraud.
[03:10:06.639 --> 03:10:06.979]  It's over.
[03:10:07.284 --> 03:10:08.484]  Yeah, right.
[03:10:08.484 --> 03:10:15.107]  This leaves the lender without this monetary... And then they try to hold us hostage and say we're going into a depression if we don't do that.
[03:10:15.107 --> 03:10:15.967]  We're already in one!
[03:10:15.967 --> 03:10:18.388]  Yeah, we're going to go into one worse if we continue this.
[03:10:18.388 --> 03:10:28.912]  And the other thing, the state of Georgia has before its house legislation that would declare gold and silver as the legal tender
[03:10:29.838 --> 03:10:31.480]  Valued by weight of specie.
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:33.603]  They're looking at pulling out of the dollar.
[03:10:33.603 --> 03:10:37.728]  That's the best thing the states could do to stabilize their economies economically.
[03:10:38.860 --> 03:10:49.622]  And one other thing, a program that was talked about a few months ago and then just kind of disappeared to force occupancy for repossessed properties.
[03:10:49.622 --> 03:11:07.926]  To allow the people to stay in the properties until either litigation was finished or until the bank... Because that doesn't drive down property values, now somebody's mowing the yard, homeless don't move in, the banks know that's the best policy, but they need to go ahead and get it fully under their control to keep it pegged to their derivatives.
[03:11:08.286 --> 03:11:10.607]  And that, everybody would win in that case.
[03:11:10.607 --> 03:11:11.967]  Even the banks would win.
[03:11:11.967 --> 03:11:19.690]  They wouldn't have all these houses that are empty, they can't insure, and if they don't keep them up, they become a public nuisance.
[03:11:19.690 --> 03:11:24.111]  Then they can get cited by the cities and the states and California.
[03:11:24.111 --> 03:11:30.313]  If you don't maintain an empty property, it's a felony because it creates such a dangerous situation.
[03:11:30.313 --> 03:11:31.874]  It's a problem for the banks.
[03:11:31.874 --> 03:11:34.234]  I'm afraid the banks are going to start bulldozing these houses.
[03:11:34.234 --> 03:11:35.615]  That's already happening in Detroit.
[03:11:37.091 --> 03:11:41.733]  This is what's happened in Detroit, what's happening in Nevada, that's just a personal story.
[03:11:41.733 --> 03:11:55.238]  Well, I remember a year and a half ago they had LA Times articles about people riding through ghost town, you know, million dollar home neighborhoods with mountain lions on the roofs and bobcats and wolves and turkeys running around.
[03:11:55.238 --> 03:11:56.859]  I mean, it's just, it's a wild kingdom.
[03:11:57.686 --> 03:12:00.687]  And this country's going to go to that.
[03:12:00.687 --> 03:12:08.388]  I hate to think of Mad Max's programs as having any truth to them, but we're looking at some really serious problems.
[03:12:08.388 --> 03:12:21.670]  Okay, let's get into the rest of your literature and these graphs and charts you've got here, Randy, and some of the different, again, you can't diagnose something over the phone or even on the radio, just basic stuff you know is working, because this is a work in progress.
[03:12:21.670 --> 03:12:26.031]  Some of the things other lawyers are doing, things you've been doing, some of the ways, some of the best suits out there.
[03:12:26.411 --> 03:12:31.816]  Best thing to do, first thing to do is look at the amount of fraud.
[03:12:31.816 --> 03:12:42.426]  The courts are saying to the lawyers, don't keep coming to me with these generic general accusations of where is the note and you don't have standing or agency or capacity.
[03:12:42.426 --> 03:12:46.930]  Give me something particular with this note that shows that this particular note's a problem.
[03:12:46.930 --> 03:12:52.374]  So, first thing you do is look at your HUD-1, at your truth in lending statement and your note.
[03:12:53.482 --> 03:13:03.165]  Almost everyone will have a principle in interest on the note that's different than the principle in interest on the Truth in Lending Statement.
[03:13:03.165 --> 03:13:07.546]  You should run an amortization on both of them.
[03:13:07.546 --> 03:13:09.186]  What you find may surprise you.
[03:13:09.186 --> 03:13:10.727]  One of the first ones I did had a $115,000 note at 6.5%.
[03:13:15.816 --> 03:13:18.918]  That came up with a $693 payment.
[03:13:18.918 --> 03:13:30.527]  The Truth in Lending, which contained the amounts that the person actually was required to pay, had 6.5% interest at $113.99.
[03:13:30.527 --> 03:13:35.470]  Almost a thousand, a little over a thousand dollars less principal, half a percent more in interest.
[03:13:35.470 --> 03:13:40.614]  Well, after you said it closing and read a stack of documents an inch high, your brain kind of turns to mud.
[03:13:40.614 --> 03:13:44.157]  And I asked Steve about that, and he said, I noticed it, but it looked like it balanced out.
[03:13:45.250 --> 03:13:55.619]  When I ran the notes together, the amount you would overpay if you paid what was on the Truth in Lending Statement on a $115,000 note in 30 years, he would have overpaid $44,000.
[03:13:55.619 --> 03:13:56.420]  So we run the calculation.
[03:14:04.844 --> 03:14:10.347]  Take that as a fraud claim, because in fraud you don't claim the amount you were actually defrauded of.
[03:14:10.347 --> 03:14:12.548]  It was a five-year-old note.
[03:14:12.548 --> 03:14:18.711]  You claim the amount you would have been defrauded of had their plan ran to fruition, $44,000.
[03:14:18.711 --> 03:14:20.612]  But you don't sue for that either.
[03:14:20.612 --> 03:14:22.312]  You sue for triple.
[03:14:22.312 --> 03:14:30.556]  First calculation, we get an amount in fraud claim greater than the amount of the original principle.
[03:14:30.556 --> 03:14:33.077]  Then look at your HUD-1 settlement statement.
[03:14:33.077 --> 03:14:34.038]  Sell these fees on there.
[03:14:35.563 --> 03:14:50.549]  The lender is only allowed to charge the borrower those fees the borrower would have to pay if they purchased the house in cash, and those fees the lender must pay to a third-party vendor.
[03:14:50.549 --> 03:14:57.492]  But at closing, he didn't provide you with any documentation to show first that the fees were proper, allowed by law,
[03:14:58.604 --> 03:15:04.189]  That the services provided by the vendor were necessary.
[03:15:04.189 --> 03:15:06.931]  That the amounts charged were reasonable.
[03:15:06.931 --> 03:15:14.558]  Neither did he show you his disbursement to show that he didn't take an unauthorized markup on the amounts charged.
[03:15:14.558 --> 03:15:15.799]  So we claim they're all bogus.
[03:15:15.799 --> 03:15:17.040]  They're all false.
[03:15:17.040 --> 03:15:22.324]  What about when they also have you sign papers saying you know this is going to be packaged and resold.
[03:15:22.324 --> 03:15:25.027]  They don't tell you this means this could cloud your title down the road.
[03:15:25.464 --> 03:15:31.547]  What they don't tell you is, for the most part, it's already sold.
[03:15:31.547 --> 03:15:36.750]  You think the guy who's standing in front of you as the lender is the guy who lent you the money.
[03:15:36.750 --> 03:15:38.511]  He's not.
[03:15:38.511 --> 03:15:41.493]  The special purpose vehicle's the one lending you the money.
[03:15:41.493 --> 03:15:42.834]  It's already been sold to him.
[03:15:42.834 --> 03:15:44.815]  And that's why the loan's already been authorized.
[03:15:44.815 --> 03:15:47.537]  And he's not licensed to do business in the state.
[03:15:47.537 --> 03:15:49.518]  He's not a licensed lender.
[03:15:49.518 --> 03:15:53.660]  The lender's lending him his license and the whole process is illegal.
[03:15:53.660 --> 03:15:57.442]  Yeah, but going back, I mean, they're winning in court and you're having success as well.
[03:15:57.442 --> 03:16:07.269]  I mean, going after the fact of show us the deed or show us who signed off on this foreclosure statement, who had notaries sign it and they didn't.
[03:16:07.269 --> 03:16:10.671]  I mean, that's working, but you're saying you're doing that and then adding other things on it.
[03:16:10.671 --> 03:16:16.235]  Yeah, we come in with a very large fraud claim against the lender.
[03:16:16.235 --> 03:16:17.896]  It's a large number.
[03:16:17.896 --> 03:16:19.817]  Frankly, we'd never win that number.
[03:16:20.913 --> 03:16:23.795]  But in the end, we don't care.
[03:16:23.795 --> 03:16:39.927]  Because the other side knows as well as we do, when we get in front of the jury and tell the jury the kind of crap all of these guys have pulled on them, the first thing the jury's going to do when they go home that night is pull out their HUD-1 settlement statement, and they're going to see a fee on there that says
[03:16:42.631 --> 03:16:47.777]  Document preparation fee, assumption fee, all of these different fees.
[03:16:47.777 --> 03:16:54.706]  And they're gonna know they've been in the same boat just like the judges who were invested in these funds and have lost two-thirds of their money in the last two years.
[03:16:54.706 --> 03:17:00.653]  And so what you talked about a few weeks ago is, once this is done, they're immediately rushing to the table wanting to make a deal.
[03:17:01.013 --> 03:17:02.334]  That's the whole idea.
[03:17:02.334 --> 03:17:05.495]  The courts are corrupt, guys.
[03:17:05.495 --> 03:17:07.055]  They're absolutely corrupt.
[03:17:07.055 --> 03:17:08.736]  You don't want to get in front of the court.
[03:17:08.736 --> 03:17:11.157]  The other side doesn't want to get in front of the court.
[03:17:11.157 --> 03:17:13.818]  Nobody can trust them, either side.
[03:17:13.818 --> 03:17:17.960]  We build as strong a case against the lender as we can.
[03:17:17.960 --> 03:17:28.424]  And this number we bring to the table, the jury, no matter what the other side does to that number, there's only one number they're going to remember.
[03:17:28.424 --> 03:17:30.245]  And that's the one you walked in the door with.
[03:17:30.990 --> 03:17:31.831]  Now it's a good number.
[03:17:31.831 --> 03:17:35.393]  We can take how we got that number to the penny.
[03:17:35.393 --> 03:17:40.697]  So we have a direct claim on this loan of an exact amount of fraud.
[03:17:40.697 --> 03:17:48.784]  And generally, $300,000 note, we can find between a million and a million two in fraud claim against the lender.
[03:17:48.784 --> 03:17:53.187]  Then we go into all of the issues that they absolutely cannot defend.
[03:17:54.010 --> 03:18:03.052]  So that's the bonafide claim is the fraud, and then you open it up to, okay, now we're in a suit, give us your deed.
[03:18:03.052 --> 03:18:06.252]  So that's how you get it into court, then you say, now, show us the deed.
[03:18:06.252 --> 03:18:15.474]  Okay, show us that, oh, like the lawyer said two hours ago, oh, you signed all these papers, and it's just some lawyer there doing the service.
[03:18:15.474 --> 03:18:18.834]  You claim that you'd reviewed everything, you just perjured yourself.
[03:18:18.834 --> 03:18:21.975]  Exactly, an attorney may not accept the word of his client.
[03:18:23.120 --> 03:18:26.662]  He must test the veracity of his client himself.
[03:18:26.662 --> 03:18:30.344]  And the first thing we want to talk to is the guy who's doing the foreclosure.
[03:18:30.344 --> 03:18:30.805]  Who are you?
[03:18:30.805 --> 03:18:35.628]  I want to see your contract with the principal.
[03:18:35.628 --> 03:18:36.748]  You're the agent?
[03:18:36.748 --> 03:18:40.010]  Agency may not be proven out of the mouth of the agent.
[03:18:40.010 --> 03:18:42.252]  It must be proven out of the mouth of the principal.
[03:18:42.252 --> 03:18:43.412]  Show me a contract.
[03:18:43.412 --> 03:18:45.754]  His problem is he doesn't know who the principal is.
[03:18:46.980 --> 03:18:53.905]  He sees these foreclosures being, these documents being filed with the court and they just pick them up and run with them.
[03:18:53.905 --> 03:18:55.387]  Whoever wins it, gets the money.
[03:18:55.387 --> 03:19:02.052]  Alright, we've got to go to calls and we'll have you back again, but we've got more graphs there that we'll cover after we take some calls.
[03:19:02.052 --> 03:19:08.717]  But Randy, we're about to go to break, but specifically, again, the 200 plus cases and you're having what success?
[03:19:08.717 --> 03:19:11.399]  Primarily we're keeping people in their houses.
[03:19:11.399 --> 03:19:14.942]  It takes generally two to two and a half years to get through a lawsuit.
[03:19:14.942 --> 03:19:16.062]  And we started this a year ago.
[03:19:16.949 --> 03:19:18.610]  Most everybody's still in their houses.
[03:19:18.610 --> 03:19:22.492]  And it's expensive with lawyers, but when people, you teach them how to do it pro se, it's not.
[03:19:22.492 --> 03:19:23.072]  It's not.
[03:19:23.072 --> 03:19:27.094]  You can afford to kick them in their teeth, and it keeps you in the house.
[03:19:27.094 --> 03:19:32.297]  This is the greatest value because property values are falling like a stone.
[03:19:33.576 --> 03:19:41.918]  And by the year 2012, if you bought a house in 07 for $300,000, you'll be lucky to get $80,000.
[03:19:41.918 --> 03:19:43.338]  We know that.
[03:19:43.338 --> 03:19:45.099]  The banks know that.
[03:19:45.099 --> 03:19:48.440]  They know their worst enemy is time.
[03:19:48.440 --> 03:19:52.521]  As time goes on, the banks build up more properties they can't get rid of.
[03:19:52.521 --> 03:19:56.562]  It's going to make them want... So you don't make it easy for them.
[03:19:56.562 --> 03:19:57.262]  Exactly.
[03:19:57.262 --> 03:19:58.962]  Alright, we're going to be right back with Randy Kelton.
[03:19:58.962 --> 03:20:01.043]  Your phone calls George, Mark, Bill, Shannon and others.

[03:21:06.081 --> 03:21:07.342]  Tyranny is here.
[03:21:07.342 --> 03:21:11.284]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:21:11.284 --> 03:21:13.505]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:21:13.505 --> 03:21:19.388]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:21:19.388 --> 03:21:25.631]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:21:26.051 --> 03:21:32.036]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:21:32.036 --> 03:21:36.219]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:21:36.219 --> 03:21:40.502]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:21:40.502 --> 03:21:46.447]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[03:21:46.447 --> 03:21:50.010]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:21:50.010 --> 03:21:51.971]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:21:51.971 --> 03:21:52.412]  It's here.

[03:23:09.179 --> 03:23:12.921]  What if there was a low-cost way of blanketing your home with clean air?
[03:23:12.921 --> 03:23:13.782]  There is!

[03:23:53.177 --> 03:23:59.199]  Okay, we've got a bunch of other graphs we're gonna go to right at the end of this hour, like foreclosure by number of bedrooms.
[03:23:59.199 --> 03:24:03.621]  It's the lower middle class, three bedrooms.
[03:24:20.662 --> 03:24:27.506]  Uh, not studios, not one bedrooms, not two bedrooms, not four, not five, but three bedrooms.
[03:24:27.506 --> 03:24:29.107]  Average American.
[03:24:29.107 --> 03:24:32.009]  Uh, let's go ahead and people with kids, let's go to your phone calls.
[03:24:32.009 --> 03:24:32.409]  1-800-259-9031.
[03:24:32.409 --> 03:24:38.913]  Uh, Randy has got a bunch of different websites for his radio show and other things he does and dealing with
[03:24:39.153 --> 03:24:40.274]  Hi Randy, I have a question.
[03:24:40.274 --> 03:24:45.817]  It looks like the banks are trying to do an end run by either using shell companies and buying back the mortgages
[03:25:03.612 --> 03:25:11.715]  So that the taxpayer gets stuck with the depreciation and has to write that off, and then they buy back and sell it at a depreciation rate.
[03:25:11.715 --> 03:25:15.957]  But the other thing is, they're also going in and buying tax certificates.
[03:25:15.957 --> 03:25:24.921]  Now, I was thinking of helping a lot of people out, of going by the tax certificates and selling back to them so they could wipe everything clean, but the banks are also going into that, Joe.
[03:25:24.921 --> 03:25:30.303]  So, I mean, it looks like the banks are trying to commit fraud on several levels by sticking the taxpayer with
[03:25:31.377 --> 03:25:42.179]  Oh no, that's admitted by Timberwolf and Goldman Sachs, that they bundle the goodies, the good mortgages for themselves, and then sell retirement funds, police funds, governments, the cruds.
[03:25:42.179 --> 03:25:43.539]  You're absolutely right.
[03:25:43.539 --> 03:25:53.681]  So they steal our equity on the front end, on the back end they steal our retirement funds, and in the middle they steal all our tax money.
[03:25:53.681 --> 03:25:58.382]  Yeah, they make us bail it out and then they don't even use it for what they said.
[03:25:58.382 --> 03:25:59.162]  Anything else, George?
[03:26:00.322 --> 03:26:02.182]  No, I just want to say, how do you stop them?
[03:26:02.182 --> 03:26:12.524]  Is there a way to stop them from committing another fraud by buying up all the tax certificates and then buying them from a shell company and basically defrauding us one more time out of the same deal?
[03:26:12.524 --> 03:26:13.464]  Can't answer that one.
[03:26:13.464 --> 03:26:15.125]  That's one I haven't researched yet.
[03:26:15.125 --> 03:26:22.546]  But you can see, I mean, we have the emails and the documents and major publications like McClatchy have detailed it and so has Congress.
[03:26:22.546 --> 03:26:24.186]  They set this thing up.
[03:26:24.186 --> 03:26:27.487]  I mean, this was set up.
[03:26:27.487 --> 03:26:28.987]  In me looking at this,
[03:26:30.336 --> 03:26:38.021]  All of these pieces, I have this graph, if you can go to that one, what they're doing is very complex.
[03:26:38.021 --> 03:26:42.783]  All of these mechanizations, before securitizations, you wouldn't have found any of that in there.
[03:26:42.783 --> 03:26:52.129]  You'd have found the lender, the... Before the end of Glass-Steagall that made all this a felony, because we'd been through this before, before that, none of this was going on.
[03:26:52.129 --> 03:26:53.410]  Great points, George.
[03:26:53.410 --> 03:26:57.212]  We're gonna go to Mark and others in a minute, but tell us about this chart, securitization flowchart.
[03:26:57.554 --> 03:27:04.238]  Yeah, this shows how the security instrument moves, how the money moves, how the documents move.
[03:27:04.238 --> 03:27:07.060]  The primary importance of this one is how complex it is.
[03:27:08.143 --> 03:27:11.786]  Attorneys, they don't have time to do the research.
[03:27:11.786 --> 03:27:15.908]  We have about $100,000 invested in research on this right now.
[03:27:15.908 --> 03:27:18.470]  And you're now, all over the country, advising law firms.
[03:27:18.470 --> 03:27:19.611]  I mean, you're meeting with lawyers.
[03:27:19.611 --> 03:27:21.973]  Yes, because they don't have time to do all of this.
[03:27:21.973 --> 03:27:25.295]  I'm also building a litigation engine.
[03:27:25.295 --> 03:27:28.537]  A computer program that never forgets any of this.
[03:27:28.537 --> 03:27:29.698]  Okay, so go over this graph.
[03:27:29.698 --> 03:27:30.919]  Where do I start here?
[03:27:30.919 --> 03:27:36.423]  So we start with the... It's hard to tell from the graph because it starts with the loan broker.
[03:27:37.281 --> 03:27:43.043]  The loan broker brings you a real estate agent will bring you to a broker.
[03:27:43.043 --> 03:27:48.525]  The broker will find you a mortgage company to write your note.
[03:27:48.525 --> 03:27:53.447]  Well, what you don't know is he always finds the same one because he's in bed with him.
[03:27:53.447 --> 03:27:56.369]  And the loan broker pays the
[03:27:57.612 --> 03:28:10.521]  Agents who bring them the note, extra fees, according to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the commission for bringing in a loan can be no more than 1% of the principal.
[03:28:10.521 --> 03:28:13.783]  But they never come away with less than 2 or 3%.
[03:28:13.783 --> 03:28:18.266]  They pay them that under the table to bring them loans that are more expensive.
[03:28:19.281 --> 03:28:36.138]  They pay the agents to breach their fiduciary duty to the borrower and upsell the note, convincing him that he only qualifies for a much more expensive loan product than he actually does.
[03:28:36.138 --> 03:28:38.901]  The very first item there, the mortgage company,
[03:28:40.970 --> 03:28:43.611]  He appears to be a mortgage company, but he's really not.
[03:28:43.611 --> 03:28:44.371]  That's this?
[03:28:44.371 --> 03:28:45.732]  That's that.
[03:28:45.732 --> 03:29:02.858]  He only appears to be because, way down at the back, the last one on the top, the investor, the investor who buys from, well this whole process, in order for the security instrument to get to the final investor, it has to go through four steps.
[03:29:02.858 --> 03:29:06.760]  The aggregator, the special purpose vehicle,
[03:29:07.774 --> 03:29:10.117]  That's where the loans are put together.
[03:29:10.117 --> 03:29:16.965]  It appears from our research that they are actually the owners of the mortgage company.
[03:29:16.965 --> 03:29:24.014]  So it appears as though the mortgage company sells the note to the aggregator when in fact they're one in the same company.
[03:29:25.066 --> 03:29:29.267]  They've all set this up so they can run through these different mechanisms.
[03:29:29.267 --> 03:29:42.510]  And then they gave the word, hey, realtors, local loan originators, everybody's allowed to do this, tell people to lie, to originate the fraud down at the bottom when the person gets the loan.
[03:29:42.510 --> 03:29:48.092]  They create the mortgage company that does the fraud, then they bankrupt the mortgage company, so he appears to disappear.
[03:29:49.059 --> 03:29:50.741]  That's like Enron, they'd already moved the money out the back.
[03:29:50.741 --> 03:29:52.384]  We're gonna come back with more calls.
[03:29:52.384 --> 03:29:53.765]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.765 --> 03:29:56.309]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.309 --> 03:29:58.973]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.216 --> 03:30:05.598]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[03:30:05.598 --> 03:30:09.501]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[03:30:09.501 --> 03:30:13.224]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[03:30:13.224 --> 03:30:22.010]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants from municipal water.
[03:30:22.230 --> 03:30:28.393]  These filters are powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water, making them perfect for rainwater collection systems.

[03:31:01.788 --> 03:31:04.109]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:31:04.109 --> 03:31:06.489]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:31:06.489 --> 03:31:09.690]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:31:09.690 --> 03:31:14.811]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:31:14.811 --> 03:31:18.992]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:31:19.312 --> 03:31:21.653]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:31:21.653 --> 03:31:24.554]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:31:24.554 --> 03:31:27.456]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:31:27.456 --> 03:31:35.059]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:31:35.393 --> 03:31:40.798]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:31:40.798 --> 03:31:43.641]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:31:43.641 --> 03:31:47.345]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:31:47.345 --> 03:31:48.406]  And I got news for you.
[03:31:48.406 --> 03:31:49.747]  You're everyone else.

[03:32:04.560 --> 03:32:07.401]  I understand that you changed the name of your product, Don.
[03:32:07.401 --> 03:32:08.281]  Yes, we did.

[03:32:14.864 --> 03:32:16.064]  How is it made, Don?
[03:32:16.064 --> 03:32:20.605]  Well, Xtendivite is made from herbs gathered from many different parts of the world.

[03:32:32.290 --> 03:32:33.170]  Yes, it will.
[03:32:33.170 --> 03:32:34.871]  All we changed was the name.
[03:32:34.871 --> 03:32:39.573]  I'm here because at 42 I had a heart attack and the garlic cayenne drops gave me back my life.
[03:32:39.573 --> 03:32:43.995]  We have been talking with Don Whiskin about his exciting new product called Xtenovite.

[03:33:13.732 --> 03:33:15.293]  Thomas Jefferson.
[03:33:15.293 --> 03:33:18.976]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:33:20.176 --> 03:33:24.800]  We'll have continual live coverage tomorrow of all the election fraud.
[03:33:24.800 --> 03:33:38.370]  I've told Steve Watson, Paul Watson, Aaron Dice, Kurt Nemo, full time, just to cover all the voting machine fraud nationwide, the troops not getting their ballots, people being indicted all over Florida, you name it, for election fraud.
[03:33:38.370 --> 03:33:44.415]  I mean, the good news is, this corruption's been here for a long time, but now it's coming up to the surface.
[03:33:45.976 --> 03:33:53.523]  You know, a few dozen law firms and a few hundred pro se litigants have brought the mortgage fraud to its knees.
[03:33:53.523 --> 03:33:55.685]  What will happen as more people get educated?
[03:33:55.685 --> 03:34:05.053]  And it doesn't mean you're going to win every time, but you know by resisting, you got a better shot at it and better systems and ideas are being developed through the law to defeat these people.
[03:34:05.053 --> 03:34:10.058]  And you can find out more at mortgagecrimes.com with what Randy Kelton is doing, just like earlier I had the
[03:34:11.659 --> 03:34:11.859]  I don't
[03:34:33.243 --> 03:34:34.964]  Filter your water.
[03:34:34.964 --> 03:34:36.446]  Or they're after our Second Amendment.
[03:34:36.446 --> 03:34:37.807]  Here's the legislation.
[03:34:37.807 --> 03:34:39.208]  Or they're trying to pass amnesty.
[03:34:39.208 --> 03:34:40.389]  Here's the legislation.
[03:34:40.389 --> 03:34:54.560]  We're just here to alert you that, hey, here's the University of Exeter, big report, research proves gender-bending chemicals like bisphenol A affecting reproduction, feminizing boys, hyperfeminizing women, causing cancer.
[03:34:54.560 --> 03:34:57.583]  We're just here warning you, telling you what's going on.
[03:34:58.143 --> 03:35:04.388]  Kind of like you're driving down the road and 70 miles an hour to the country, and you see a sign saying, 20 mile an hour turn.
[03:35:04.388 --> 03:35:07.370]  If you don't slow down, folks, you're gonna go flying right off the edge.
[03:35:07.370 --> 03:35:08.431]  And you know, here's the deal.
[03:35:08.431 --> 03:35:10.113]  We're all in this together.
[03:35:10.113 --> 03:35:27.567]  When you warn your neighbors, when you warn your friends and family, when you buy my books and videos and support us, and get tools like Follow the Republic, an invisible empire that show people who really runs things, we're identifying the crooks, so that as things get worse and worse as they planned, they won't be able to pose as our saviors and get even more power, they're gonna go to prison!
[03:35:28.621 --> 03:35:32.362]  And look how far we've come passing a bill this year to audit the Fed.
[03:35:32.362 --> 03:35:34.463]  Sure, they butchered it in the Senate.
[03:35:34.463 --> 03:35:39.385]  But we've gone from Ron Paul with no co-sponsors 15 years ago to passing bills.
[03:35:39.385 --> 03:35:44.666]  Now the globalists are identified as the criminals, as Zbigniew Brzezinski admitted four months ago.
[03:35:44.666 --> 03:35:47.267]  Humanity is awake and staring at them.
[03:35:47.267 --> 03:35:49.028]  We're identifying the bad guy.
[03:35:49.688 --> 03:35:50.348]  And as G.I.
[03:35:50.348 --> 03:35:53.329]  Joe says, knowing the bad guy is half the battle.
[03:35:53.329 --> 03:35:56.870]  That's why they told us Homeland Security was for guys with turbines on their heads.
[03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:58.311]  Now they admit it's for us.
[03:35:58.311 --> 03:36:03.092]  Because they're the bad guys staging the terror attacks as a pretext to come after us.
[03:36:03.092 --> 03:36:11.915]  And they're coming after us militarily, economically, psychologically, spiritually, medically, physically, and this is one big area, financially.
[03:36:12.395 --> 03:36:19.221]  Because money is a symbol of energy, and that's how they buy up the whole world for nothing out of their fraud, as Thomas Jefferson said.
[03:36:19.221 --> 03:36:23.204]  And we're waking up homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered.
[03:36:23.204 --> 03:36:27.667]  Now, going back to Randy Kelton, I want to get to these calls as quickly as possible.
[03:36:27.667 --> 03:36:32.311]  Just talk to... Who's up first here of all these callers?
[03:36:32.311 --> 03:36:33.052]  Alright, Mark and Pia.
[03:36:33.052 --> 03:36:33.912]  We're going to move quick now.
[03:36:33.912 --> 03:36:34.453]  Mark, go ahead.
[03:36:36.249 --> 03:36:39.871]  I commend you, Mr. Kelton, for all you're doing.
[03:36:39.871 --> 03:36:41.252]  I listened to you last week.
[03:36:41.252 --> 03:36:43.734]  You got me on the edge of my seat.
[03:36:43.734 --> 03:36:49.277]  The challenge here to me is that the battle that's before us is a temporary battle.
[03:36:49.277 --> 03:36:51.218]  It's a significant battle.
[03:36:51.218 --> 03:36:53.440]  But my concern is what's on the other side of this.
[03:36:53.440 --> 03:36:56.982]  This is the foundational aspect of who we are as a free people.
[03:36:56.982 --> 03:36:58.723]  The property rights of an individual.
[03:36:58.723 --> 03:37:01.365]  And after they come after the property, what are they going to come after next?
[03:37:01.365 --> 03:37:02.806]  Us as individuals?
[03:37:02.806 --> 03:37:04.527]  And so, to me,
[03:37:05.253 --> 03:37:08.454]  This whole thing is their party.
[03:37:08.454 --> 03:37:12.255]  It's their casino, like Max Keiser says.
[03:37:12.255 --> 03:37:17.337]  And it's all based upon the UCC and all of that.
[03:37:17.337 --> 03:37:19.478]  So we're dealing in their arena.
[03:37:19.478 --> 03:37:27.601]  So on the other side of this, we have to wake up and get to the core, core issue of what real property rights are, what it really means to be free.
[03:37:28.208 --> 03:37:36.073]  So, I mean, this is just, to me, it's a distraction, and they're just playing a game with us and stripping us out and keeping us distracted.
[03:37:36.073 --> 03:37:37.754]  Hey, hey, listen, Mark, I appreciate your call.
[03:37:37.754 --> 03:37:38.775]  We've got to move on.
[03:37:38.775 --> 03:37:46.700]  You know, all the Patriot folks with the UPC stuff that I've been seeing for 15 years has rendered almost no success.
[03:37:46.700 --> 03:37:51.704]  This is rendering serious success, charging them with fraud because they've engaged in it.
[03:37:52.644 --> 03:37:56.106]  Uh, and, uh, this is not an exercise in fatality.
[03:37:56.106 --> 03:38:05.810]  Uh, it's having a big effect, and I never understand why, when we're up here with real solutions, people, people, uh, you know, say, well, it's their party, it's their system.
[03:38:05.810 --> 03:38:09.192]  Yes, it's their fraudulent system, and we're here exposing it.
[03:38:09.192 --> 03:38:13.474]  Just exposing their fraud, again, is half the equation.
[03:38:13.474 --> 03:38:14.454]  Okay.
[03:38:14.454 --> 03:38:17.055]  And I'm glad you, you mentioned that point.
[03:38:17.055 --> 03:38:20.877]  Because, frankly, I'm not here primarily for foreclosure issues.
[03:38:22.259 --> 03:38:24.281]  Alex knows my primary focus.
[03:38:24.281 --> 03:38:25.863]  It's grand juries.
[03:38:25.863 --> 03:38:28.346]  I've been helping people with due process issues.
[03:38:28.346 --> 03:38:32.791]  And I tell them, the worst one, the key to all of this is the judge.
[03:38:32.791 --> 03:38:35.014]  Go in there and kick that judge in his behind.
[03:38:35.014 --> 03:38:36.235]  And they say, I'm not going to do that.
[03:38:36.235 --> 03:38:36.976]  I can go to jail.
[03:38:37.777 --> 03:38:48.780]  But when I've got someone with a foreclosure issue, where they're stealing his house and everything he owns, but his liberty's not at risk, and I say, that dirty, rotten, scoundrel judge is breaking the law.
[03:38:48.780 --> 03:38:51.281]  You need to go down and file current complaints with him.
[03:38:51.281 --> 03:38:53.221]  That's what you mean by kicking him in the butt?
[03:38:53.221 --> 03:38:54.061]  Yes.
[03:38:54.061 --> 03:38:55.722]  You use the grand jury against him.
[03:38:55.722 --> 03:39:00.203]  I just did a seminar in Las Vegas of people who help other people.
[03:39:01.095 --> 03:39:04.126]  And they weren't so interested in hearing about the foreclosure issue.
[03:39:04.126 --> 03:39:05.591]  They already knew about it.
[03:39:05.591 --> 03:39:07.378]  They want to know how to go after the judges.
[03:39:08.527 --> 03:39:12.450]  We get people going after the judges, we will change everything.
[03:39:12.450 --> 03:39:15.552]  And people don't do it because they say they're invincible.
[03:39:15.552 --> 03:39:17.253]  They're not invincible.
[03:39:17.253 --> 03:39:19.775]  They're actually the weakest link.
[03:39:19.775 --> 03:39:24.018]  I have stood in court a number of times and said to the bailiff, did you hear that Mr. Bailiff?
[03:39:24.018 --> 03:39:26.620]  Drag that judge down off that bench.
[03:39:26.620 --> 03:39:32.504]  I have never once had a judge threaten me with contempt for doing that to him.
[03:39:32.504 --> 03:39:33.545]  He knew.
[03:39:33.545 --> 03:39:35.406]  He's in deep water here.
[03:39:35.406 --> 03:39:37.308]  The judges know they're the weakest link.
[03:39:38.339 --> 03:39:41.581]  The last thing they want you to know is how vulnerable they are.
[03:39:41.581 --> 03:39:51.328]  And with these foreclosure issues, I can get people to realize- Well, that's like the baby they took in New Hampshire, putting a fake criminal record in it for somebody else and everything.
[03:39:51.328 --> 03:39:57.553]  And because there was political pressure, when they got up there before the judge, the judge said, there's not enough evidence, release the baby.
[03:39:57.553 --> 03:39:59.934]  But see, they had the will to fight.
[03:39:59.934 --> 03:40:01.836]  Most people just roll over.
[03:40:01.836 --> 03:40:02.756]  Exactly.
[03:40:02.756 --> 03:40:04.978]  And this is the key.
[03:40:04.978 --> 03:40:06.279]  And look, they can't stop us all.
[03:40:06.279 --> 03:40:07.059]  Let's go to another caller.
[03:40:08.539 --> 03:40:12.961]  I understand part of your point, but the rest of it is, this is having an effect.
[03:40:12.961 --> 03:40:14.862]  People are staying in their houses.
[03:40:14.862 --> 03:40:16.102]  I mean, I don't know what else you want.
[03:40:16.102 --> 03:40:18.723]  I mean, this is a real remedy.
[03:40:18.723 --> 03:40:20.304]  Let's talk to Shannon in Mississippi.
[03:40:20.304 --> 03:40:22.264]  Thanks for holding.
[03:40:22.264 --> 03:40:23.245]  Hey, how you doing?
[03:40:23.245 --> 03:40:23.665]  Good.
[03:40:23.665 --> 03:40:26.126]  Got a question for Mr. Randy.
[03:40:26.126 --> 03:40:35.570]  Mr. Randy, I know you probably heard about it, but my mom and my real dad got a divorce and then she married an Air Force veteran in the Air Force for 28 years.
[03:40:36.843 --> 03:40:44.767]  Well, he died, and they gave her a silver certificate, one-time buyer's plan on a house.
[03:40:44.767 --> 03:40:54.592]  Well, my mom, she went and bought a house, like a acre of land, and back in the 2002, she bought it, and it was like $140,000.
[03:40:54.592 --> 03:41:06.458]  Okay, now, my mom has died, and under that silver certificate, through the military, are they getting insurance if
[03:41:07.406 --> 03:41:12.568]  They come and try to take that house because we missed one payment on it.
[03:41:12.568 --> 03:41:19.271]  Are there any insurance we could take to the grand jury to say, hey, no, you can't do this?
[03:41:19.271 --> 03:41:21.371]  That's my question.
[03:41:21.371 --> 03:41:23.572]  I'm not familiar with the silver certificate.
[03:41:23.572 --> 03:41:28.474]  Is that some type of guarantee against foreclosure?
[03:41:28.474 --> 03:41:29.855]  Is that like some kind of, uh,
[03:41:33.325 --> 03:41:46.212]  Well, there was a one-time buyer's plan I understood from my mom before she died through the United States Air Force saying that they would give her the money or credit her a certain amount.
[03:41:46.212 --> 03:41:47.232]  I believe it was up to $150,000.
[03:41:47.232 --> 03:41:53.556]  She bought the house for like $140,000.
[03:41:53.556 --> 03:42:01.140]  And now I'm kind of scared and worried that through it was through the United States Air Force and the government,
[03:42:01.636 --> 03:42:06.560]  They could come in and just swipe it out from under the family.
[03:42:06.560 --> 03:42:13.665]  So has anybody... Did she have the... Did she have a clear title to it?
[03:42:13.665 --> 03:42:15.086]  Or did she have a mortgage?
[03:42:15.086 --> 03:42:25.294]  I wanted to ask you, the only thing that was not at the paper signing or anything that I could see was a clear title or deed.
[03:42:25.294 --> 03:42:30.938]  How would I know about locating... Is there a mortgage on the property?
[03:42:32.082 --> 03:42:35.203]  Yes, they are.
[03:42:35.203 --> 03:42:39.285]  Is this a mortgage from the original purchase?
[03:42:39.285 --> 03:42:51.789]  The mortgage from the original purchase, which I would assume would be through the military.
[03:42:51.789 --> 03:42:58.952]  Was the original purchase of the home, did it have a mortgage on it then or is this a refinance later?
[03:43:01.280 --> 03:43:07.786]  Sir, it was a refinance later, the military okayed it.
[03:43:22.742 --> 03:43:23.382]  Hello?
[03:43:23.382 --> 03:43:24.503]  Yes, go ahead.
[03:43:24.503 --> 03:43:26.343]  I have a question for Randy.
[03:43:26.343 --> 03:43:31.366]  I've got my property, which I do hold the deed for, it's paid for.
[03:43:31.366 --> 03:43:38.729]  For example, if my house would go into foreclosure, could they still come and take my house, although my property's paid for?
[03:43:38.729 --> 03:43:42.670]  How do they have a lien against it?
[03:43:42.670 --> 03:43:47.612]  I mean, no, I've got the deed for my property, is what I'm saying, it's paid for.
[03:43:47.612 --> 03:43:49.353]  But I've got a mortgage on my house.
[03:43:49.904 --> 03:43:51.967]  Then, yes, based on the mortgage.
[03:43:51.967 --> 03:43:56.793]  The mortgage gives them a claim against the title.
[03:43:56.793 --> 03:43:59.737]  Well, you hold the title, and the title is in your name.
[03:44:01.618 --> 03:44:14.949]  The mortgage gives the mortgagee a claim against the title in the event that you don't meet the requirements of the note, the security insurance.
[03:44:14.949 --> 03:44:19.052]  But are you talking about the warranty date on the entire property or any conventions on that?
[03:44:19.052 --> 03:44:20.813]  I mean, is there a separate piece of property?
[03:44:20.813 --> 03:44:21.714]  Have you subdivided it?
[03:44:21.714 --> 03:44:23.736]  Or are you talking about just the house?
[03:44:23.736 --> 03:44:27.579]  I'm just talking about the property that sits on the house.
[03:44:27.579 --> 03:44:29.140]  Yeah, absolutely they can foreclose.
[03:44:29.551 --> 03:44:30.752]  They still can foreclose.
[03:44:30.752 --> 03:44:33.173]  Okay, that's all I need to know.
[03:44:33.173 --> 03:44:35.055]  All right, thank you.
[03:44:35.055 --> 03:44:44.501]  With that said, if they've done this within the last 10 years, the note, if you fight them, they won't have authority to foreclose almost certainly.
[03:44:44.501 --> 03:44:47.483]  Because they clouded the entire chain of title since then.
[03:44:47.483 --> 03:44:47.963]  Exactly.
[03:44:47.963 --> 03:44:48.944]  You can fight them.
[03:44:48.944 --> 03:44:49.985]  All right, let's go ahead.
[03:44:49.985 --> 03:44:54.468]  This is different if you've got a house bought before 11 years ago on average.
[03:44:54.468 --> 03:44:55.388]  Yes.
[03:44:55.388 --> 03:44:57.670]  They can probably take it because it was done properly.
[03:44:58.001 --> 03:44:58.401]  Hello?
[03:45:22.366 --> 03:45:34.070]  Can you explain again, Randy, the difference between the Truth in Lending Statement and the HUD-1, and how to figure that out, and what are the fees that the lender can't charge that you're saying are illegal?
[03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.730]  Okay.
[03:45:34.730 --> 03:45:35.911]  Truth in Lending Statement.
[03:45:36.892 --> 03:45:43.259]  The Truth in Lending Statement, it's one page, and it will, right across the middle, it'll have four boxes.
[03:45:43.259 --> 03:45:53.811]  It'll show the interest rate, the total amount of interest you'll pay, the total amount of principal, and the principal and interest combined.
[03:45:53.811 --> 03:45:56.955]  And then under that will be a section that'll show what your payments will be.
[03:45:57.998 --> 03:46:04.043]  Now this is required to be within an eighth of a percent of what the final amount is.
[03:46:04.043 --> 03:46:10.468]  You're supposed to get a truth in lending statement after you file the loan application.
[03:46:10.468 --> 03:46:13.790]  And then a final truth in lending statement within three days of closing.
[03:46:13.790 --> 03:46:16.572]  But you normally see it right there in the signing.
[03:46:16.572 --> 03:46:22.777]  The HUD-1 settlement statement, that's the two-page legal size document with lines all over it.
[03:46:22.777 --> 03:46:24.379]  It goes from line 100 to line 1400.
[03:46:26.769 --> 03:46:30.490]  The second page starts at line 700.
[03:46:30.490 --> 03:46:34.751]  That lists all the fees you pay at closing.
[03:46:34.751 --> 03:46:36.931]  Now, you look at those fees.
[03:46:36.931 --> 03:46:39.211]  There's a loan origination fee.
[03:46:39.211 --> 03:46:41.572]  That's a fee that's paid to a vendor.
[03:46:41.572 --> 03:46:45.433]  That's paid to the person as a commission for bringing them the note.
[03:46:45.433 --> 03:46:48.293]  That can be no more than 1% of the note.
[03:46:48.293 --> 03:46:52.174]  If you look down below it, you sometimes see a yield spread premium.
[03:46:53.103 --> 03:46:54.943]  That's exactly the same thing.
[03:46:54.943 --> 03:46:58.884]  I've seen two yields spread premiums at a loan origination fee.
[03:46:58.884 --> 03:47:03.205]  So they'll triple charge under different names, and is that federal law that they're not allowed to do that?
[03:47:03.205 --> 03:47:09.766]  That's federal law, the Truth in Lending Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and Truth in Lending Act.
[03:47:09.766 --> 03:47:13.807]  Specifically limit what the lender can charge the borrower.
[03:47:13.807 --> 03:47:15.707]  But then how do they get away with doing it?
[03:47:15.707 --> 03:47:17.327]  People don't know.
[03:47:17.327 --> 03:47:21.188]  So they have you sign that you know about the Truth in Lending, but you waive it?
[03:47:22.079 --> 03:47:25.881]  No, they don't even do that.
[03:47:25.881 --> 03:47:28.843]  The lenders call these junk fees.
[03:47:28.843 --> 03:47:35.908]  They just stuff them in there and what we've done is pulled a dirty, stinking, rotten lawyer trick on them.
[03:47:35.908 --> 03:47:47.815]  We claim that they added these fees in there so that they could, they're extra fees, it was intended that all of these costs be absorbed in the interest that they charge you.
[03:47:49.500 --> 03:47:51.101]  Part of the finance charge.
[03:47:51.101 --> 03:47:53.223]  But they added them to the head of the note.
[03:47:53.223 --> 03:47:55.865]  They charge you interest on them for 30 years.
[03:47:55.865 --> 03:48:00.589]  And we maintain they take those amounts and they slip them under the table to the loan originator.
[03:48:00.589 --> 03:48:03.912]  Because now there's interest on fees that have already been jacked up.
[03:48:03.912 --> 03:48:08.816]  Yes, and that adds... They don't even give you the opportunity to pay a separate check flat off for that.
[03:48:08.816 --> 03:48:16.322]  On a 6% note, if they add $1,000 to the principal, you'll pay $5,900 over the life of the note.
[03:48:16.322 --> 03:48:18.543]  And on average, with a $300,000 house, you're saying it's over $40,000?
[03:48:19.344 --> 03:48:20.285]  Yes.
[03:48:20.285 --> 03:48:21.727]  Alright, I hope that answers your question.
[03:48:21.727 --> 03:48:24.050]  I appreciate the call.
[03:48:24.050 --> 03:48:28.435]  Up next here, John, I got my list confused.
[03:48:28.435 --> 03:48:30.978]  Mike in Louisiana, you're on the air with Randy Kelton and Alex Jones.
[03:48:30.978 --> 03:48:31.839]  Go ahead.
[03:48:31.839 --> 03:48:33.020]  Hey Alex, long time listener.
[03:48:33.020 --> 03:48:34.261]  Really appreciate the show.
[03:48:34.261 --> 03:48:36.524]  I've got a question for your guest.
[03:48:36.524 --> 03:48:37.826]  I'm in the mortgage business and
[03:48:38.467 --> 03:48:48.118]  He's thrown out some of the terms, but as far as the limitation on a 1% origination being the maximum amount you can charge on a loan, that's only for FHA loans.
[03:48:48.118 --> 03:48:59.490]  For conventional loans, for what used to be non-conforming loans, sub-prime, all pay, you could charge more than 1%, but the FHA limits you to 1%, and there's other fees that are not allowable fees.
[03:49:00.237 --> 03:49:00.477]  I don't
[03:49:14.514 --> 03:49:17.576]  A payment outside of closing when the loan is sold.
[03:49:17.576 --> 03:49:24.381]  I used to be a broker, a mortgage broker, who's been the whipping boy for this whole industry for the last three years.
[03:49:24.381 --> 03:49:28.224]  And what happened is we would originate the loan and get paid for that.
[03:49:28.224 --> 03:49:41.114]  And also, based on the interest rate that we were able to sell in the free market at, let's say, the going rate was five, and we sold a five percent rate that might be par, meaning there was no yield spread premium.
[03:49:41.850 --> 03:49:48.416]  Uh, and it has to be disclosed on the Good Faith Estimate, and it also has to be disclosed on the HUD-1 Settlement Statement in a certain block, and he referenced those.
[03:49:48.416 --> 03:49:56.823]  However, if you sold the loan at 5.25, that extra quarter point in rate would mean that you might get a yield spread premium of, let's say, 1%.
[03:49:57.794 --> 03:50:08.008]  I know we don't want to get too obtuse on a radio show, but Section 32 is the law that regulates how much an originator can make, and it's more than 1%.
[03:50:08.008 --> 03:50:11.293]  Well, here's a simple question.
[03:50:11.293 --> 03:50:12.695]  I want Randy to be able to comment on this.
[03:50:12.695 --> 03:50:13.836]  We're skipping this final break.
[03:50:14.557 --> 03:50:38.461]  You know it's real simple before 99 or so they would not go out and induce people the brokers and others to you know exaggerate how much money they make or whatever and the loan officers and I'm just boiling all this down to simplistic terms above it wouldn't certify it but but something changed and we've all heard about that I understand the whipping boys when the low-level people
[03:50:38.701 --> 03:50:42.846]  We're talking about the big mega banks that engineered all this, so I'm not saying you're the devil.
[03:50:42.846 --> 03:50:50.894]  You were, you know, going through your industry and what was standard operating procedure, just like giving somebody chemotherapy is, because the American Medical Association says so.
[03:50:50.894 --> 03:50:56.380]  But, I mean, specifically, things did change, and the whole thing's grinding to a halt.
[03:50:56.380 --> 03:50:58.362]  I mean, bottom line, what are you saying to Randy?
[03:50:58.362 --> 03:50:58.963]  That he's wrong?
[03:51:00.882 --> 03:51:01.102]  We're good.
[03:51:18.522 --> 03:51:19.963]  The issue we bring, the note is very clear.
[03:51:19.963 --> 03:51:23.224]  You sign this contract and you say, I agree to pay this amount of principal at this interest.
[03:51:44.522 --> 03:51:51.207]  And then the lender comes along with this other document that has a different principle on it and a different interest.
[03:51:51.207 --> 03:51:59.975]  And when I run the two of them, the one with the different principle and interest doesn't come up with the same cost to me as what I agreed to.
[03:51:59.975 --> 03:52:03.978]  So you're saying the fraud is people are shown one bill and then on the final day another bill?
[03:52:05.408 --> 03:52:14.797]  That's because you could go to bank 1 and get 5% and they charge you $2,000 for a 5% loan for 30 years and bank number 2 is going to charge you $2,500 for it.
[03:52:14.797 --> 03:52:20.662]  And so the truth in lending, the whole point of that was to help you determine what that bank 2 is charging you more.
[03:52:20.662 --> 03:52:22.824]  And they quantify it in the form of an interest rate.
[03:52:22.824 --> 03:52:24.345]  I looked at the truth in lending statement.
[03:52:24.345 --> 03:52:26.347]  I'm not sure what you're quantifying.
[03:52:26.347 --> 03:52:31.972]  I know I sign a note and it says I agree to pay X amount of principal at X amount of interest.
[03:52:32.998 --> 03:52:41.543]  How does it get that the Truth in Lending Statement has a payment amount on it?
[03:52:41.543 --> 03:52:49.388]  If I pay that payment, I will pay thousands and thousands more than what I agreed to.
[03:52:49.388 --> 03:52:52.931]  That's listed on the Truth in Lending, matches the note rate.
[03:52:52.931 --> 03:52:54.172]  Absolutely.
[03:52:54.172 --> 03:52:55.132]  It does about 25% of the time.
[03:52:56.977 --> 03:53:07.068]  Well, if the PMI carries over to that, so you might be mistakenly looking at a Truth in Lending that has a PI plus a PMI charge on there and it not computing because the people didn't put down 20%.
[03:53:07.068 --> 03:53:11.653]  Hey, why don't you, I bet you'd like to talk to Mike Offair.
[03:53:11.653 --> 03:53:12.274]  Yes, I would.
[03:53:12.274 --> 03:53:17.940]  So send him an email there at mortgagecrimes.com or Randy, what's an email for you?
[03:53:19.421 --> 03:53:20.221]  That would be a great one.
[03:53:20.221 --> 03:53:21.782]  I'm having basically the same problem here.
[03:53:21.782 --> 03:53:22.302]  It is quite academic.
[03:53:22.302 --> 03:53:23.162]  I'm looking at your website
[03:53:39.605 --> 03:53:44.126]  And I'm trying to... See, I don't actually know what an 801 is or a HUD-1 settlement.
[03:53:44.126 --> 03:53:45.847]  I don't know what these things look like.
[03:53:45.847 --> 03:53:50.808]  And I'm wondering if you have a complete example, something that we can look at front to back and learn how to... Sure, sure.
[03:53:50.808 --> 03:53:54.409]  No, he's just giving you basic things for you to go dig it out yourself and look at it.
[03:53:54.409 --> 03:53:57.930]  Yeah, you can... If you look in your loan package,
[03:53:59.472 --> 03:54:02.255]  The HUD-1 is really easy to locate.
[03:54:02.255 --> 03:54:07.961]  It's the only one that has lines all down the document.
[03:54:07.961 --> 03:54:13.127]  I haven't looked at the website today, but we should have a HUD-1 interactive.
[03:54:14.418 --> 03:54:17.340]  On the website that you can open up and fill in the amount.
[03:54:17.340 --> 03:54:18.260]  Yeah, but let's be clear.
[03:54:18.260 --> 03:54:23.924]  We had a lawyer on earlier from ICE Legal who's in the Wall Street Journal winning these cases.
[03:54:23.924 --> 03:54:27.186]  Just to hear what he had to say, just like we're hearing from Randy.
[03:54:27.186 --> 03:54:29.487]  Randy's involved in a whole bunch of stuff as a pro se litigant.
[03:54:29.487 --> 03:54:31.769]  He's not there to hold everybody's hand through this.
[03:54:31.769 --> 03:54:36.992]  We're just talking about general issues that are going on and Randy's now trying to develop and codify all this.
[03:54:37.452 --> 03:54:40.175]  This is all a work in progress.
[03:54:40.175 --> 03:54:41.356]  We don't have all the answers.
[03:54:41.356 --> 03:54:42.276]  I certainly don't.
[03:54:42.276 --> 03:54:45.219]  I'm just here investigating all this from different perspectives.
[03:54:45.219 --> 03:54:56.028]  And this issue of the Truth in Lending Statement, I've had a number of people that I've talked to about the Truth in Lending Statement, and it always comes up different.
[03:54:56.028 --> 03:55:02.174]  I never can get anything clear and definitive that tells me why Steve was required to pay $720 a month
[03:55:04.838 --> 03:55:10.839]  On the truth in lending, when the note he agreed to came up to $693,000.
[03:55:10.839 --> 03:55:12.059]  Couldn't figure that one out.
[03:55:12.059 --> 03:55:13.620]  Alright, I get it.
[03:55:13.620 --> 03:55:15.020]  I don't have to look at your website.
[03:55:15.020 --> 03:55:16.220]  Alright, listen, I gotta jump.
[03:55:16.220 --> 03:55:17.100]  Thank you.
[03:55:17.100 --> 03:55:18.360]  Interesting points, Dan.
[03:55:18.360 --> 03:55:19.240]  Pablo in Oregon.
[03:55:19.240 --> 03:55:19.801]  You're on the air.
[03:55:19.801 --> 03:55:21.581]  Go ahead.
[03:55:21.581 --> 03:55:22.581]  Yes, Alex.
[03:55:22.581 --> 03:55:23.621]  Yes.
[03:55:23.621 --> 03:55:24.501]  Alex.
[03:55:24.501 --> 03:55:27.122]  Okay, let's be real quick.
[03:55:27.122 --> 03:55:27.802]  I trade currency.
[03:55:27.802 --> 03:55:30.222]  I've been trading currency for the last 10 years.
[03:55:30.222 --> 03:55:32.563]  I worked at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
[03:55:32.563 --> 03:55:33.663]  Worked at the Board of Trade.
[03:55:34.909 --> 03:55:35.450]  I understand.
[03:55:58.937 --> 03:55:59.418]  I think so.
[03:56:22.953 --> 03:56:30.037]  And my mother asked him, okay, are you not willing to do it?
[03:56:30.037 --> 03:56:32.139]  Or do you not want to do it?
[03:56:32.139 --> 03:56:34.800]  And they responded, we're not going to do it.
[03:56:34.800 --> 03:56:38.803]  So just lawlessly not giving people their money.
[03:56:38.803 --> 03:56:40.444]  And this is happening more and more.
[03:56:40.444 --> 03:56:42.965]  They're now starting to just take pensions, Randy.
[03:56:42.965 --> 03:56:45.887]  Yes, and I expect this to get a whole lot worse.
[03:56:45.887 --> 03:56:48.389]  It may well be that they don't have the money to give back to them.
[03:56:49.352 --> 03:56:55.257]  If they've got it in bad investments, but this is not a place for me to comment on because this gets into investment.
[03:56:55.257 --> 03:56:56.819]  Yeah, what's your bottom line, Pablo?
[03:56:56.819 --> 03:56:59.341]  What are you saying?
[03:56:59.341 --> 03:57:04.245]  Basically, they told her she was incompetent to manage her own money.
[03:57:04.245 --> 03:57:10.231]  And I told her that this was a perfect example and that this was a godsend that this happened.
[03:57:10.231 --> 03:57:13.654]  Because in another situation where the market flashes down,
[03:57:14.094 --> 03:57:15.515]  Precisely, I'd go straight to a grand jury.
[03:57:37.808 --> 03:57:39.689]  That's primarily my strategy.
[03:57:39.689 --> 03:57:50.917]  And by the way, we get hundreds of calls like this and emails every couple days, and then we see it in the news, where paid-for houses are being taken, pensions, stocks.
[03:57:50.917 --> 03:58:01.745]  The thieving is already... In fact, I've got a Before It's News article, insider stock sell-off, 3,177 to 1 sell-to-buy ratio.
[03:58:01.745 --> 03:58:05.548]  All the big elites are dumping their stocks right now.
[03:58:05.548 --> 03:58:07.009]  I'm surprised it's taken them so long.
[03:58:08.106 --> 03:58:11.350]  I told my brother, too, a year and a half ago, he didn't.
[03:58:11.350 --> 03:58:12.511]  He lost almost everything.
[03:58:13.410 --> 03:58:14.871]  Well, we're out of time, Randy.
[03:58:14.871 --> 03:58:16.612]  It's mortgagecrimes.com.
[03:58:16.612 --> 03:58:17.893]  People want to get in contact with you.
[03:58:17.893 --> 03:58:19.213]  It's a work in progress.
[03:58:19.213 --> 03:58:20.894]  I'll be back tomorrow live, 11 a.m.
[03:58:20.894 --> 03:58:21.975]  to 2 p.m.
[03:58:21.975 --> 03:58:22.715]  Central Standard Time.
[03:58:22.715 --> 03:58:23.996]  We did an hour of overdrive today.
[03:58:23.996 --> 03:58:25.117]  Great job of the crew.
[03:58:25.117 --> 03:58:27.458]  Remember, if you believe in the work we're doing, we need your support.
[03:58:27.458 --> 03:58:30.580]  Infowars.com, the online video bookstore.
[03:58:30.580 --> 03:58:34.022]  A lot of key info coming up straight ahead with the retransmission.
[03:58:34.022 --> 03:58:35.603]  Spread the word about the broadcast.
[03:58:35.603 --> 03:58:36.844]  We appreciate you all.
[03:58:36.844 --> 03:58:37.864]  We're going to see you back tomorrow.
[03:58:37.864 --> 03:58:38.345]  God willing.
[03:58:38.345 --> 03:58:38.645]  Take care.
[03:58:44.677 --> 03:58:48.099]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[03:58:56.761 --> 03:58:58.022]  Tyranny is here.
[03:58:58.022 --> 03:59:01.666]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:59:01.666 --> 03:59:04.189]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:59:04.189 --> 03:59:10.055]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:59:10.055 --> 03:59:16.302]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[03:59:16.702 --> 03:59:22.664]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:59:22.664 --> 03:59:26.865]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[03:59:26.865 --> 03:59:31.146]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:59:31.146 --> 03:59:37.108]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[03:59:37.108 --> 03:59:40.649]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:59:40.649 --> 03:59:42.630]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:59:42.630 --> 03:59:43.070]  It's here.
