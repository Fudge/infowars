[00:00:04.881 --> 00:00:09.743]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:11.343]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.343 --> 00:00:12.884]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.884 --> 00:00:17.085]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.085 --> 00:00:21.127]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.247 --> 00:00:40.408]  Welcome, my friends, welcome and thank you for joining us.
[00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:42.468]  It is Tuesday, the 20th day of July 2010.
[00:00:42.468 --> 00:00:47.389]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:55.611]  We have Steve Watson joining us from London to break down a lot of important world news and give us his perspective.
[00:00:55.611 --> 00:01:00.852]  Predominantly, we're going to be talking about this incredible report that broke yesterday.
[00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.933]  This is not new news to our audience, but it's new news to the world.
[00:01:04.853 --> 00:01:08.236]  A hidden world growing beyond control.
[00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:12.059]  Top secret America.
[00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:24.749]  854,000 plus private corporate executives in every town and city who are at the same level as FBI and NSA.
[00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:28.372]  The highest security clearances in the country.
[00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:32.322]  I've looked at past numbers.
[00:01:32.322 --> 00:01:42.088]  There were maybe 5,000 people in the government a decade ago that had a clearance this high, and that's in the government.
[00:01:42.088 --> 00:01:46.390]  There are more security clearances now in corporate positions than there are in government.
[00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.273]  This is the Fortune 100 becoming the government.
[00:01:51.273 --> 00:01:54.976]  This is a full corporate overthrow of the United States.
[00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:59.859]  These corporations are bigger than most nation states' GDP every year.
[00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:05.879]  And chief among the NSA fronts is Google.
[00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:08.361]  And that's also in the article.
[00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:16.666]  Google isn't allowed to go out and illegally grab everybody's wireless data because the government likes them.
[00:02:16.666 --> 00:02:20.748]  Google's allowed to do this because Google is the government.
[00:02:20.748 --> 00:02:22.609]  People say, well then why do you fight on Google?
[00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.890]  Why do you use Google?
[00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.171]  Because that's where the war is.
[00:02:27.193 --> 00:02:33.021]  They're able to predict mob psychology to almost 100% with long-term trends.
[00:02:33.021 --> 00:02:38.489]  They're able to predict individual actions with over a 90% accuracy, and that's something they admit.
[00:02:39.588 --> 00:02:43.170]  This is an NSA tracking system, but they need more data.
[00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.032]  So they set it up to control the Internet, and Google says they want to be the Internet.
[00:02:48.032 --> 00:03:06.402]  They're allowed to break the rules when no other corporation is to this level, to consolidate control so they get all the real-time data that's then tied into all the RFID and smart dust being implanted in all the new products to track everything in the real world, not just in cyberspace.
[00:03:06.402 --> 00:03:07.022]  And they do that off
[00:03:07.022 --> 00:03:11.044]  Off your cell phone tracking where you're at in real time, they can dial in and listen to you.
[00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:13.305]  Off what you're surfing on your internet.
[00:03:13.305 --> 00:03:20.888]  Off your license plates that are being scanned by the license plate reading cameras and put through the Google NSA grid.
[00:03:20.888 --> 00:03:32.534]  Google is the public persona of the National Security Agency, but the National Security Agency is being absorbed itself into the corporate Google.
[00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:39.063]  So really, to properly state this, it isn't that the NSA created Google, though they did with DARPA.
[00:03:40.535 --> 00:03:44.597]  It's that it was created to absorb everything.
[00:03:44.597 --> 00:04:00.043]  To absorb the internet, to absorb the government, to absorb how you pay your power bills, to absorb the phone companies, to absorb the computer manufacturing, to control everything.
[00:04:00.043 --> 00:04:02.844]  Google, for what, five years, has been selling electrical power.
[00:04:03.797 --> 00:04:11.319]  It is meant to take over everything, and of course they're the biggest promoters, along with BP and other criminal organizations, of the global carbon tax.
[00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:16.220]  So, that's always the government joke, you know, don't be evil.
[00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:23.661]  Somebody tells you, oh, don't be evil, you know, this big powerful organization, you know they're actually planning evil.
[00:04:23.661 --> 00:04:30.923]  And they've got all these, you know, well-meaning leftist and people that are compartmentalized and don't see the larger picture of what's going on.
[00:04:30.923 --> 00:04:32.823]  So just giant developments on that front.
[00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:35.975]  Huge BP news.
[00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:37.797]  Huge financial news.
[00:04:37.797 --> 00:04:39.158]  Blagojevich news.
[00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:41.080]  Iran news.
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.062]  Naked body scanner news.
[00:04:43.062 --> 00:04:45.524]  Where they admit they're scanning small children.
[00:04:45.524 --> 00:04:47.466]  Violating child porn laws in the U.S.
[00:04:47.466 --> 00:04:48.007]  That's in the St.
[00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:49.989]  Petersburg Times.
[00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:51.490]  Also, Bohemian Grove news.
[00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.052]  That's been in full swing for five days.
[00:04:53.052 --> 00:04:54.833]  A lot of mainstream news on that.
[00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:56.034]  It's all coming up today.
[00:04:56.034 --> 00:04:57.035]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.035 --> 00:04:57.496]  Stay with us.
[00:05:04.048 --> 00:05:05.309]  Tyranny is here.
[00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:09.193]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:05:09.193 --> 00:05:11.495]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:05:11.495 --> 00:05:17.360]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:23.586]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:29.988]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:05:29.988 --> 00:05:34.149]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:05:34.149 --> 00:05:38.450]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:44.392]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:05:44.392 --> 00:05:47.953]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:05:47.953 --> 00:05:49.934]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:05:49.934 --> 00:05:50.354]  It's here.

[00:06:03.927 --> 00:06:10.351]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:06:10.351 --> 00:06:17.736]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:06:17.736 --> 00:06:22.600]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:07:01.325 --> 00:07:05.288]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:07:05.288 --> 00:07:14.155]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:07:14.155 --> 00:07:18.799]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:07:18.799 --> 00:07:29.608]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:07:30.228 --> 00:07:39.751]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[00:08:02.898 --> 00:08:03.899]  Big Brother.
[00:08:03.899 --> 00:08:05.560]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:06.942]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:06.942 --> 00:08:08.203]  You want answers?
[00:08:08.203 --> 00:08:10.285]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:10.285 --> 00:08:14.168]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:25.564]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:25.564 --> 00:08:29.711]  Steve Watson from London joining us in T-minus 52 minutes.
[00:08:29.711 --> 00:08:36.722]  Then we have Glenn Spencer from the front lines of the imploding border from American Border Patrol joining us from Arizona.
[00:08:37.583 --> 00:08:46.585]  We've had car bombings, mass machine-gunning deaths of 17, shootouts on the Arizona and Texas border in the last week, and we talked to Glenn.
[00:08:46.585 --> 00:08:52.706]  He says things are getting ready to explode, and he's always been accurate with his trend forecasting in the past.
[00:08:52.706 --> 00:08:55.687]  Glenn Spencer, more than 20 years in the fight for U.S.
[00:08:55.687 --> 00:08:56.347]  sovereignty.
[00:08:56.347 --> 00:09:00.108]  He's got private drones in the air for the last three years.
[00:09:00.108 --> 00:09:01.928]  Just amazing information.
[00:09:01.928 --> 00:09:04.989]  That is all coming up in the last hour today, and yes,
[00:09:05.669 --> 00:09:09.353]  We're also going to open the phones up right now for first-time callers.
[00:09:09.353 --> 00:09:15.338]  I want to give first-time callers, people who email me and write me all the time saying they can never get through, this is your chance.
[00:09:15.338 --> 00:09:19.802]  We'd love to hear from you on any of the issues we discuss here or any news topics you want to raise.
[00:09:19.802 --> 00:09:20.163]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:21.304]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:09:21.304 --> 00:09:21.884]  Let's go ahead.
[00:09:31.013 --> 00:09:31.593]  We're good to go.
[00:09:53.936 --> 00:09:57.239]  And they've lied at least three separate times claiming they'd cap the well.
[00:09:57.239 --> 00:10:01.963]  So I would love to believe all of this, but who knows what the real truth is.
[00:10:01.963 --> 00:10:03.244]  Time will tell.
[00:10:03.244 --> 00:10:12.692]  Oil from BP's blowout well is again seeping into the Gulf of Mexico, but this time more slowly, and scientists aren't convinced the cap that stopped the flow last week is making things worse.
[00:10:14.994 --> 00:10:23.818]  The government said Monday that oil was seeping into the Gulf after days of warning that the experimental cap on the well would cause more leaks.
[00:10:23.818 --> 00:10:28.501]  That's because down in the drill hole itself it's shattered.
[00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:38.486]  Despite what at first seemed a setback though, the federal government declared the development insignificant and forged ahead with BP's plan for finally sealing the hole in the ocean floor.
[00:10:38.486 --> 00:10:40.847]  But if for 80 plus days it's been blasting up
[00:10:42.268 --> 00:10:56.816]  And if they had fissures down in the drill hole and they didn't successfully frack it, as they call it, then how is capping it going to fix anything if there's already other holes down beneath?
[00:10:56.816 --> 00:10:59.738]  So this just sounds like incredible spin.
[00:11:00.908 --> 00:11:14.159]  Ever since the cap was used to bottle the oil last week, engineers have been watching underwater cameras and monitoring pressure and seismic readings to see whether the well would hold or spring a new leak, perhaps one that could rupture the seafloor and make the disaster even worse.
[00:11:14.159 --> 00:11:23.726]  Small amounts of oil and gas started coming from the cap Sunday, but we do not believe it is consequential at this time, retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said.
[00:11:23.726 --> 00:11:27.890]  Also, seepage from the seafloor was detected over the weekend.
[00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:33.153]  Less than two miles away, but Allen said it probably had nothing to do with the well.
[00:11:33.153 --> 00:11:34.994]  Hmm.
[00:11:34.994 --> 00:11:36.615]  That doesn't make sense.
[00:11:36.615 --> 00:11:44.040]  Oil and gas are known to ooze naturally from fissures in the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico, which they do occasionally do.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.341]  So let's pray they're telling us the truth.
[00:11:46.341 --> 00:11:48.403]  The problem is they normally lie.
[00:11:48.403 --> 00:11:51.204]  Even when the truth would suit them, they tend to lie.
[00:11:51.204 --> 00:11:53.006]  It's just their modus operandi.
[00:11:55.029 --> 00:12:00.234]  You know the old, what is it, African parable about the scorpion and the frog?
[00:12:00.234 --> 00:12:04.378]  And the scorpion comes over to the frog and says, will you let me ride on your back across the river?
[00:12:04.378 --> 00:12:06.380]  And the frog says, no, you're a scorpion.
[00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.321]  You'll sting me and kill me.
[00:12:07.321 --> 00:12:09.263]  And he says, no, I promise I won't.
[00:12:09.263 --> 00:12:11.285]  I want to be friendly.
[00:12:11.285 --> 00:12:12.786]  I've changed my ways.
[00:12:12.786 --> 00:12:15.149]  And the nice frog says, OK, go ahead and climb on my back.
[00:12:15.149 --> 00:12:15.809]  I'll take you across.
[00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:22.173]  There he swims him across, and then when they get to the other side, the scorpion jumps off, stings the frog, and the frog's laying there in pain, dying.
[00:12:22.173 --> 00:12:23.614]  He says, why did you sting me?
[00:12:23.614 --> 00:12:24.074]  I helped you.
[00:12:24.074 --> 00:12:26.435]  And he said, well, I'm a scorpion.
[00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:29.937]  BP says seepage near well unrelated.
[00:12:30.876 --> 00:12:31.136]  I don't

[00:13:07.817 --> 00:13:14.018]  Oil spill threatened by possible tropical system this weekend that could turn into a hurricane.
[00:13:14.018 --> 00:13:25.741]  A well-developed tropical wave currently bringing strong winds and rough seas north of Puerto Rico could develop into a tropical system by the weekend, according to AccuWeather.com, hurricane meteorologists.
[00:13:25.741 --> 00:13:28.622]  And it goes on, there is a high potential for this tropical wave.
[00:13:30.094 --> 00:13:37.819]  To evolve into a tropical depression later on this week, wind shear is currently hindering any tropical storm organization of the system.
[00:13:37.819 --> 00:13:38.479]  That's good news.
[00:13:38.479 --> 00:13:41.621]  However, this wave moves swiftly west.
[00:13:41.621 --> 00:13:47.725]  The shear will diminish over the next few days and could turn into a tropical depression and then a hurricane.
[00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:52.548]  Hope that doesn't happen to hinder the relief effort.
[00:13:52.548 --> 00:13:57.131]  And also British MP to visit US clouded by BP worries.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.321]  So that is all going on.
[00:14:01.321 --> 00:14:04.622]  Let's look at some financial news now.
[00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:08.843]  Leading Chinese economists urge governments to dump U.S.
[00:14:08.843 --> 00:14:10.204]  Treasuries by gold.
[00:14:10.204 --> 00:14:13.205]  This is by Steve Watson at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:19.807]  He links and reports from a Reuters report and some news put out by the Chinese government itself.
[00:14:19.807 --> 00:14:22.928]  Fears reemerge that China could resort to nuclear option.
[00:14:25.455 --> 00:14:32.641]  We've also seen the Chinese government in the last two weeks downgrade the dollar and other European currencies as well, like the euro.
[00:14:32.641 --> 00:14:36.204]  Prominent economists in China are calling for the government to ditch vast holdings of U.S.
[00:14:36.204 --> 00:14:46.913]  Treasuries, or the biggest holders in the world, I would add, favoring a tangible asset such as gold, a move that would have a far-reaching impact on the economy, plus driving up the price of gold.
[00:14:46.913 --> 00:14:49.195]  Reuters reports that Yu Yongding, a
[00:14:49.795 --> 00:14:54.920]  Former academic advisor to the Chinese Central Bank has appealed to the state representatives to move away from U.S.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:15:00.546]  debt and invest in assets dominated in other currencies as well as other financial instruments and real goods.
[00:15:00.546 --> 00:15:04.971]  Although assets in other currencies and forms are not an ideal replacement for U.S.
[00:15:04.971 --> 00:15:10.337]  Treasury bonds, diversification should be a basic principle you wrote in the Chinese Securities Journal.
[00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.005]  When demand for U.S.
[00:15:13.005 --> 00:15:16.769]  Treasuries is strong, it is a rare opportunity for us to gradually pull back.
[00:15:16.769 --> 00:15:20.953]  That way it will not have a big impact on prices and China will not suffer too much.
[00:15:20.953 --> 00:15:23.355]  So he's saying race for the exits.
[00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:24.917]  Key report.
[00:15:24.917 --> 00:15:35.247]  Here's one by Kurt Nemo reporting on that video I shot last week where I talked about this could be a road warrior type collapse that's being engineered by design.
[00:15:36.778 --> 00:15:49.745]  And if we have a Great Depression-level depression, which it appears is becoming a certainty, not just a possibility, we're definitely in a depression, but the question is how deep will it get, that society could really unravel.
[00:15:49.745 --> 00:15:55.848]  And Kurt Nemo's written an excellent article giving a lot of government document, mainstream news and alternative news, data points.
[00:15:55.848 --> 00:15:58.150]  I mean, this thing is just filled with hyperlinks.
[00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:01.051]  I spent like 45 minutes this morning just going through his story.
[00:16:01.051 --> 00:16:01.832]  It was so well written.
[00:16:02.532 --> 00:16:05.633]  And at so many data points, I learned a lot reading it.
[00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:14.317]  It's got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 links backing up everything that Kurt says here and backing up the fact that the vast majority of people that took the Infowars.com poll believe Road Warrior Depression is coming.
[00:16:29.875 --> 00:16:35.222]  There were just more than 6,000 people that took the poll and the vast majority did find that.
[00:16:35.222 --> 00:16:44.234]  So you can go to the site and look that up for yourself and read over the issues that we're talking about and make the decision for yourself where you think this nation is going.
[00:16:45.902 --> 00:16:49.164]  Let's now look at what's happening with Blagojevich, the disgraced Illinois governor.
[00:17:15.976 --> 00:17:26.320]  It has already come out in the trial, what, two weeks ago, that he was shopping for jobs and that he was doing illegal favors for Rahm Emanuel and Barack Obama.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:32.702]  And, of course, that BP, for years, had paid for the luxury, million-dollar apartment for Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff.
[00:17:32.702 --> 00:17:33.942]  It's just all completely illegal.
[00:17:33.942 --> 00:17:37.503]  But Blagojevich is going to jail for this, probably.
[00:17:37.503 --> 00:17:38.304]  Why aren't they?
[00:17:38.304 --> 00:17:40.744]  This is out of CBS Chicago.
[00:17:40.744 --> 00:17:45.226]  Blagojevich expected to take witness stand, but his brother must finish up first.
[00:17:46.994 --> 00:17:53.819]  Opposed Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich is expected to finally step in the witness box at his corruption trial today.
[00:17:53.819 --> 00:17:59.643]  Though exactly when will depend partly on how quickly prosecutors finish cross-examining his brother.
[00:17:59.643 --> 00:18:07.389]  So now the whole Chicagoland mafia system is on display.
[00:18:07.389 --> 00:18:10.171]  Here's a key article out of USA Today.
[00:18:10.171 --> 00:18:11.852]  Opposing view on the Supreme Court.
[00:18:11.852 --> 00:18:13.213]  A big government vision.
[00:18:14.895 --> 00:18:25.382]  And it gets into quotes by Elena Kagan and her support for total government and that she believes that you can, quote, disappear any free speech the government doesn't like.
[00:18:26.616 --> 00:18:28.837]  But how is that an opposing view on the Supreme Court?
[00:18:28.837 --> 00:18:30.618]  I mean, she is the worst ever.
[00:18:30.618 --> 00:18:37.680]  I mean, on record, we never had anybody who hadn't been a judge, or hadn't been a trial lawyer, or hadn't been a constitutional scholar.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:47.204]  She's just a Goldman Sachs minion, the former head of Harvard, and is a political hack, who's anti-free speech and anti-gun, so she's in.
[00:18:47.204 --> 00:18:55.007]  Though polls show that since the science of polling began a hundred years ago, she has the lowest support rate for confirmation of anyone ever.
[00:18:56.351 --> 00:18:58.152]  So the government's like, everybody hates her!
[00:18:58.152 --> 00:18:59.153]  She's anti-American!
[00:18:59.153 --> 00:19:00.214]  She's in!
[00:19:00.214 --> 00:19:00.875]  She's in!
[00:19:00.875 --> 00:19:01.996]  Wow!
[00:19:01.996 --> 00:19:08.501]  She's a globalist like us!
[00:19:08.501 --> 00:19:09.461]  Here's another report.
[00:19:10.555 --> 00:19:12.395]  out of the Arizona newspaper.
[00:19:12.395 --> 00:19:15.976]  This is AZ Star, Arizona Star.
[00:19:15.976 --> 00:19:19.937]  Approval of Obama drops to 28% in New Arizona poll.
[00:19:19.937 --> 00:19:22.598]  It's dropped below 40 in national polls.
[00:19:22.598 --> 00:19:29.659]  So he is now in complete and absolute total free fall right now.
[00:19:29.659 --> 00:19:32.720]  When we come back, I'm going to get into
[00:19:34.537 --> 00:19:37.478]  Some Bohemian Grove news in the mainstream media.
[00:19:37.478 --> 00:19:45.382]  They have their satanic revelry from the 15th of July to the end of the month for 15 days every year since the 1870s.
[00:19:45.382 --> 00:19:46.003]  Well, 1876.
[00:19:46.003 --> 00:19:50.705]  I cover it in my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:19:50.705 --> 00:19:52.766]  And a newspaper in California made a joke about it.
[00:19:52.766 --> 00:19:56.008]  It said, no dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:19:56.008 --> 00:20:00.050]  But first, I want to get to the naked body airport scanners and big developments on that front.
[00:20:03.197 --> 00:20:06.600]  If you're in a service business, that's money ringing in your ears.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:10.403]  If your phone's not ringing, chances are it's a problem with your marketing.
[00:20:10.403 --> 00:20:14.487]  Landscapers, painters, roofers, carpet cleaners, pet sitters, handymen.
[00:20:14.487 --> 00:20:20.292]  Anyone with a residential service business can build a huge and loyal customer base fast with the Magic Yellow Flyer.

[00:21:04.759 --> 00:21:06.020]  Tyranny is here.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:09.963]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:21:09.963 --> 00:21:12.186]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:21:12.186 --> 00:21:18.051]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on earth.
[00:21:18.051 --> 00:21:24.317]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:21:24.717 --> 00:21:30.661]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:21:30.661 --> 00:21:34.864]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:21:34.864 --> 00:21:39.167]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:21:39.167 --> 00:21:45.112]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[00:21:45.112 --> 00:21:48.674]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:21:48.674 --> 00:21:50.655]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:21:50.655 --> 00:21:51.096]  It's here.

[00:21:59.716 --> 00:22:09.738]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[00:22:09.738 --> 00:22:16.160]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:25.022]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[00:22:25.402 --> 00:22:34.587]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[00:22:34.587 --> 00:22:39.590]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world reserve currency.
[00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:40.991]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:40.991 --> 00:22:43.492]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.

[00:23:00.154 --> 00:23:10.547]  Protect your freedoms and be independent by learning how to maintain, repair, and customize your own firearms through these exclusive video training courses on DVD from the American Gunsmithing Institute.

[00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:48.396]  It seems like yesterday, but it was long ago when our republic was still free.
[00:24:13.021 --> 00:24:22.423]  Many of our freedoms have been eroded, destroyed by design, but we're here to restore them.
[00:24:22.423 --> 00:24:26.364]  We've got so much more.
[00:24:26.364 --> 00:24:27.944]  Deadlines and commitments.
[00:24:41.421 --> 00:24:51.667]  Coming up in the next segment I'm going to get into the latest Google news and it's big and affects everybody.
[00:24:51.667 --> 00:24:59.832]  This is key intel that's come out and confirmed everything that we were able to analyze just from our organic perspective.
[00:24:59.832 --> 00:25:02.594]  But that's coming up and then of course your phone calls.
[00:25:02.594 --> 00:25:04.935]  But I wanted to get into this first.
[00:25:04.935 --> 00:25:05.756]  This is out of the St.
[00:25:05.756 --> 00:25:07.037]  Petersburg Times.
[00:25:08.317 --> 00:25:12.624]  Airport body scanners reveal all but one about when it's your kid.
[00:25:14.429 --> 00:25:18.590]  And the story admits that there are health risks.
[00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:21.211]  It's now 20 to 50 times, depending on which type of machine.
[00:25:21.211 --> 00:25:22.631]  There's two different machines.
[00:25:22.631 --> 00:25:23.752]  One is 20 times worse.
[00:25:23.752 --> 00:25:25.712]  One is 50 plus times worse.
[00:25:25.712 --> 00:25:28.053]  More radiation than they had previously said.
[00:25:28.053 --> 00:25:30.574]  Now they admit they are recording your naked body.
[00:25:30.574 --> 00:25:35.075]  There have been multiple reports about TSA workers that are forced to go through this.
[00:25:35.075 --> 00:25:38.676]  And their bosses every day go, look at your breast.
[00:25:38.676 --> 00:25:41.257]  Look at how small your male member is.
[00:25:42.077 --> 00:25:45.323]  There's fistfights, there's lawsuits, there's freakouts.
[00:25:45.323 --> 00:25:47.406]  Because you've got a lot of petty control freaks.
[00:25:47.406 --> 00:25:50.111]  You've got a lot of good TSA people.
[00:25:50.111 --> 00:25:52.996]  I mean, I've talked to them.
[00:25:52.996 --> 00:25:54.518]  Most of the time now when I fly.
[00:25:54.518 --> 00:25:55.260]  Most of the time.
[00:25:57.383 --> 00:25:58.343]  They're fans.
[00:25:58.343 --> 00:26:02.044]  I mean, I've signed autographs now about half the time I go through TSA.
[00:26:02.044 --> 00:26:03.764]  They're like, hey, we're getting a union soon.
[00:26:03.764 --> 00:26:04.464]  We know the truth about 9-11.
[00:26:04.464 --> 00:26:07.285]  Hey, yeah, my supervisor's a fan, too.
[00:26:07.285 --> 00:26:08.885]  We signed this for my son.
[00:26:08.885 --> 00:26:09.725]  This is in Austin.
[00:26:09.725 --> 00:26:10.606]  This is in L.A.
[00:26:10.606 --> 00:26:13.106]  This is all over the country.
[00:26:13.106 --> 00:26:15.286]  So I'm not just here bashing TSA people.
[00:26:15.286 --> 00:26:18.367]  A lot of them are veterans and people that don't want to work for the post office.
[00:26:18.367 --> 00:26:20.748]  You know, they're kind of that government type.
[00:26:20.748 --> 00:26:21.568]  And they want 15, 16 bucks an hour.
[00:26:24.059 --> 00:26:27.112]  Instead of nine bucks an hour in this bad economy, they can get it at McDonald's.
[00:26:28.413 --> 00:26:32.555]  And so they're going through the procedures, and they know it's about an act of submission.
[00:26:32.555 --> 00:26:36.858]  Take your shoes off, answer questions, let us feel your breast.
[00:26:36.858 --> 00:26:39.119]  But there's also a lot of perverts and control freaks.
[00:26:39.119 --> 00:26:55.889]  I mean, it's come out a bunch of them have been caught being pedophiles, or trying to pick women up, or saying, I'm gonna bust you for drugs, even when they don't have drugs, if you don't become my, quote, sex slave, or they've had quite a few of them go crazy, and say, I'm God, and start running around in the airport, one of them taking his clothes off, just going completely insane.
[00:26:57.233 --> 00:26:58.794]  Just going completely insane.
[00:26:58.794 --> 00:27:00.975]  Same stuff's happening in England and Canada.
[00:27:00.975 --> 00:27:03.497]  I mean, you get some petty person.
[00:27:03.497 --> 00:27:06.839]  Everybody's worked at a crummy job in high school or college.
[00:27:06.839 --> 00:27:09.120]  I mean, I've worked at Walmart.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.262]  I've worked at an ice cream shop.
[00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:21.328]  And you have some weird boss who's been there for 10 years and makes $3 more an hour than you, and they just scream at you and yell at you and just relish the petty power.
[00:27:21.328 --> 00:27:24.490]  That's what tyranny does, is it gives all those nobodies
[00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:34.637]  Who aren't ashamed to dominate people, and who enjoy the raw exercise of power, an excuse to run your life.
[00:27:34.637 --> 00:27:43.564]  And now under this corporate tyranny, the fact that most of the government is now corporate run, and that we have a corporate form of governance coming in, I'm going to cover that after the break.
[00:27:43.564 --> 00:27:46.406]  Now that this is all being admitted, this is hellish!
[00:27:46.406 --> 00:27:48.868]  I mean, in the US and Canada at the last G20s,
[00:27:50.290 --> 00:28:00.317]  They allowed private security forces in plain clothes to grab citizens and put bags over their heads and throw them into cars.
[00:28:00.317 --> 00:28:08.783]  And then Rob Doo was there at that military base when he got arrested at the G20 for videotaping.
[00:28:08.783 --> 00:28:19.851]  And they were, when people would beg to go to the urinal, they had porta-potties in the old armory, they would just sit there laughing at people while they went to the bathroom.
[00:28:21.781 --> 00:28:26.665]  Enjoying humiliating someone, enjoying the power.
[00:28:26.665 --> 00:28:44.777]  It's now come up that one of the deputy heads of the Housing and Urban Development, who was also an NAACP chief, said, look, I didn't like this white farmer, and I thought he was uppity and thought he might be racist, so I just didn't help him.
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.221]  It's that same mindset.
[00:28:50.221 --> 00:29:00.429]  I mean, if I was a white person and worked in that and I went to some black person's farm and they acted like they might not like me, I'm too prideful to discriminate against them.
[00:29:00.429 --> 00:29:04.291]  I'm too prideful to use power to cheat and dominate people.
[00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:05.252]  It's not even pride.
[00:29:05.252 --> 00:29:08.154]  It's like a sense of justice.
[00:29:08.154 --> 00:29:10.916]  I mean, I'm too good to even do dirty tricks against my enemies.
[00:29:10.916 --> 00:29:11.597]  I won't do it.
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:13.922]  But there's so many people that do.
[00:29:13.922 --> 00:29:23.615]  So you got racist whites abusing black people, and now you got a lot of black folks getting in positions of power, and they're openly bragging, hey, I'm gonna, I'm gonna oppress me some white people.
[00:29:23.615 --> 00:29:26.739]  Well, that turns you into exactly what you claim you've been fighting.
[00:29:26.739 --> 00:29:28.461]  How on earth could you act like that?
[00:29:28.461 --> 00:29:30.003]  Of course, he's had to step down now.
[00:29:31.241 --> 00:29:31.961]  But that's coming up.
[00:29:31.961 --> 00:29:36.782]  I'm going to come back and hit these airport body scanners, where they make you put your children through it.
[00:29:36.782 --> 00:29:41.664]  And the good news is, USA Today, others are reporting there's a huge backlash.
[00:29:41.664 --> 00:29:46.625]  Air traffic's way down because of this, and they may be forced to back off if we keep putting pressure on them.
[00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:50.606]  Stay with us.
[00:29:50.606 --> 00:29:52.007]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.007 --> 00:29:54.527]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.527 --> 00:29:57.208]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.014 --> 00:30:04.557]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.557 --> 00:30:05.477]  Number 1.
[00:30:05.477 --> 00:30:08.899]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:08.899 --> 00:30:09.759]  Number 2.
[00:30:09.759 --> 00:30:14.642]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:14.642 --> 00:30:15.383]  It's true.
[00:30:15.383 --> 00:30:20.265]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.265 --> 00:30:21.086]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.086 --> 00:30:24.668]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:24.668 --> 00:30:28.370]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:28.570 --> 00:30:29.370]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.131]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.131 --> 00:30:35.813]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:35.813 --> 00:30:36.593]  Number 5.
[00:30:36.593 --> 00:30:40.755]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:45.797]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:31:59.676 --> 00:32:04.659]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:05.640]  What have we got?
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.101]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:32:08.101 --> 00:32:09.102]  A republic.
[00:32:09.102 --> 00:32:11.744]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:32:11.744 --> 00:32:14.005]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:32:14.005 --> 00:32:16.026]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:32:16.026 --> 00:32:17.707]  So they think they own our land?
[00:32:17.707 --> 00:32:19.028]  They think they own our water?
[00:32:19.028 --> 00:32:19.628]  Children?
[00:32:19.628 --> 00:32:20.769]  Our education?
[00:32:20.769 --> 00:32:21.590]  Our money?
[00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:25.252]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:32:25.612 --> 00:32:30.579]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:32:30.579 --> 00:32:31.600]  We have the facts.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:32.762]  We have the Constitution.
[00:32:32.762 --> 00:32:33.683]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:32:33.683 --> 00:32:34.564]  We have common law.
[00:32:34.564 --> 00:32:37.088]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:32:37.088 --> 00:32:40.873]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[00:32:40.953 --> 00:32:45.916]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:32:45.916 --> 00:32:47.417]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:32:47.417 --> 00:32:48.497]  Don't tread on me.
[00:32:48.497 --> 00:32:55.381]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:33:20.618 --> 00:33:37.892]  Alright callers we're getting to you here in just a few minutes but I wanted to finish up with the airport body scanner story.
[00:33:37.892 --> 00:33:38.173]  St.
[00:33:38.173 --> 00:33:40.935]  Petersburg Times.
[00:33:40.935 --> 00:33:46.319]  We've been beating the drum for several years against the naked body scanners because almost two years ago
[00:33:47.589 --> 00:33:50.693]  They started putting them in European airports.
[00:33:50.693 --> 00:33:59.583]  Then, the head of Homeland Security, Chertoff, ordered several hundred of them right before Bush left office.
[00:34:01.837 --> 00:34:05.720]  That's why we knew they were scheduled to start going in in December of January.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.482]  Late 2009, early 2010.
[00:34:08.482 --> 00:34:12.926]  But they had the underwear bombing and said, oh my gosh, we just decided to order these.
[00:34:12.926 --> 00:34:14.947]  Don't worry, we just decided to put them in.
[00:34:14.947 --> 00:34:19.070]  They said that the evening of Christmas Day, hours after the staged bombing.
[00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:21.032]  And it later came out it was a staged event.
[00:34:21.032 --> 00:34:23.574]  We cover that in my film, Police State 4.
[00:34:23.574 --> 00:34:27.417]  The rise of FEMA that the establishment has been busy trying to censor.
[00:34:30.086 --> 00:34:40.498]  And we knew it had a high level of radiation and was very damaging, very close to a chest x-ray from the studies that have been out many years before, even in mainstream news.
[00:34:40.498 --> 00:34:43.822]  We knew that it did record your naked body.
[00:34:43.822 --> 00:34:46.966]  That's how the government was showing images of the system for demonstration.
[00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:56.156]  Then they started putting them in in England and other areas and they'd have their movie stars go through and the women would print off their naked body and say, please sign it for me, honey baby.
[00:34:56.156 --> 00:34:58.098]  And that came out in the news.
[00:34:58.098 --> 00:35:02.103]  And now they admit, yes, you're not going to be able to opt out.
[00:35:02.103 --> 00:35:03.905]  We're going to make everyone do it.
[00:35:03.905 --> 00:35:06.287]  They're trying to pass a Senate bill to make it law.
[00:35:07.188 --> 00:35:16.232]  And what it really is is a biometric scan, 360 of your body, for passive scanners that up to and a mile and a half away.
[00:35:16.232 --> 00:35:20.253]  And by the way, that was finally in Wired Magazine just last week.
[00:35:20.253 --> 00:35:25.796]  Will you guys reprint that about the cameras to look through your clothes at a mile and a half away?
[00:35:25.796 --> 00:35:30.397]  And these cameras project basically a type of sonar or radar.
[00:35:30.397 --> 00:35:32.738]  It's akin to it.
[00:35:32.738 --> 00:35:36.340]  And it's really high power to be able to see through your clothes at a mile and a half away.
[00:35:37.423 --> 00:35:51.114]  And it just looks right through your clothes and scans, and just like you could have a handprint for biometric access, and it creates a digital calculation off measurements, or off of your face, or off of your retina, or off of your thumbprint.
[00:35:51.114 --> 00:35:54.497]  I was reading the Pentagon talking about doing this a decade ago.
[00:35:54.497 --> 00:36:01.843]  So that's how I knew this was the rollout, just like I knew they were gonna, 15 years ago, have license plate readers everywhere, everywhere you went tracking you.
[00:36:01.843 --> 00:36:02.524]  Or in 96, I read the,
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:04.760]  Tell me
[00:36:24.568 --> 00:36:28.914]  The phone company isn't tapped by the NSA, it is the NSA.
[00:36:28.914 --> 00:36:33.660]  They're merging with the corporations, and the corporations are making money off of this.
[00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.363]  And now, what is the big cover story yesterday?
[00:36:36.363 --> 00:36:42.451]  A hidden world growing beyond control, the secret America.
[00:36:45.592 --> 00:36:56.741]  Close to a million secret spies, all heavily paid, in every position of power and expanding, tracking everything you do with the highest security clearances.
[00:36:56.741 --> 00:36:59.143]  And these people are on power trips.
[00:36:59.143 --> 00:37:00.804]  And they're given undue trade advantage.
[00:37:03.205 --> 00:37:04.587]  It's the new social class.
[00:37:04.587 --> 00:37:07.669]  It isn't about being white in America to be the dominant class.
[00:37:07.669 --> 00:37:12.673]  It's about being a government operative or a corporate slash government operative with government power.
[00:37:12.673 --> 00:37:14.595]  But that's coming up after calls.
[00:37:14.595 --> 00:37:17.977]  Steve Watson's coming up.
[00:37:17.977 --> 00:37:20.519]  The issue here is we can fight back against this.
[00:37:20.519 --> 00:37:21.440]  This is outrageous.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.042]  This is an act of domination.
[00:37:24.042 --> 00:37:27.965]  They also have satellites and blimps that get your heat signature.
[00:37:28.837 --> 00:37:36.180]  Your heat biometric signature from the top of your head and your shoulders at close to 100% accuracy.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:38.621]  They've got that in place.
[00:37:38.621 --> 00:37:44.244]  But first they need it attached to your name and your license.
[00:37:44.244 --> 00:37:53.008]  Or they'd have to send more than just Google Street View out to take photos of your house and to scan and to steal all of your digital internet traffic.
[00:37:54.636 --> 00:37:57.197]  That's the NSA through Google as their front.
[00:37:57.197 --> 00:38:03.259]  So when you go to the airport, they've got your name, it's in the database, they put you in the scanner.
[00:38:03.259 --> 00:38:05.419]  It goes around, gets a scan of your body.
[00:38:05.419 --> 00:38:07.100]  They've got your number now.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:09.201]  They've got a biometric scan of your body.
[00:38:09.201 --> 00:38:12.222]  These body scanners are biometric readers.
[00:38:12.222 --> 00:38:17.083]  Just like when you go to get a driver's license under the REAL ID Act, which is a national ID card.
[00:38:17.083 --> 00:38:22.745]  And again, I told you that 14 years ago, my first film 13 years ago, America Destroyed by Design.
[00:38:24.989 --> 00:38:30.213]  goes over all of that from the executive order.
[00:38:30.213 --> 00:38:32.855]  When you put your thumb on, it's now on the database.
[00:38:32.855 --> 00:38:34.216]  So now the cops can pull you over.
[00:38:34.216 --> 00:38:37.399]  And I told you, they start pulling you over, making you thumbprint.
[00:38:37.399 --> 00:38:42.463]  It's a federal database slash international database.
[00:38:42.463 --> 00:38:45.605]  So you're being enrolled in the grid.
[00:38:45.605 --> 00:38:46.246]  Here's another one.
[00:38:46.246 --> 00:38:50.829]  Terahertz detectors could see through your clothes from a mile away.
[00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:53.632]  And the intel I've got is it's actually many more than just a mile.
[00:38:54.645 --> 00:39:01.028]  But there it is.
[00:39:01.028 --> 00:39:10.834]  So will you submit, will you let them put your five-year-old daughter or son or your 10-year-old daughter or son or your wife in there?
[00:39:10.834 --> 00:39:23.661]  And the first time I saw this was 12 years ago, a clothing company that sells higher quality clothes to a rich clientele, Prada's,
[00:39:25.034 --> 00:39:30.617]  I saw it in the Washington Post in 1998.
[00:39:30.617 --> 00:39:38.660]  We made a big deal about this on air at the time, that it was a biometric body scanner that scanned your body for fitting clothes.
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:46.424]  And then I did more research and found out it was basically a Pentagon front that was basically giving the machines free to companies.
[00:39:46.424 --> 00:39:51.927]  In fact, search engine the term body scan, body scanners at
[00:39:54.192 --> 00:39:54.292]  For
[00:40:10.635 --> 00:40:12.156]  Chips implanted in your body.
[00:40:12.156 --> 00:40:14.276]  You wanna go to the Baja Beach Club?
[00:40:14.276 --> 00:40:18.138]  You wanna go to the VIP Champagne Room with the girls in bikinis?
[00:40:18.138 --> 00:40:21.739]  You wanna get free year pass when it's $50 cover?
[00:40:21.739 --> 00:40:32.282]  All you do is do a one-time $100 fee to be implanted with a chip, and all the girls have got the chip, and it's so much fun.
[00:40:32.282 --> 00:40:34.683]  They found some article, but that's not the one I remember.
[00:40:34.683 --> 00:40:37.404]  Is that talking about body scan technology?
[00:40:39.602 --> 00:40:51.965]  Yes, it says body scan technology will help apparel firms improve the fit of their mass-produced clothing by providing valuable measurement data on consumer
[00:40:53.541 --> 00:40:55.463]  I'm trying to read it from 10 feet away.
[00:40:55.463 --> 00:40:56.384]  Population.
[00:40:56.384 --> 00:40:59.247]  So see, oh, you want to buy this online?
[00:40:59.247 --> 00:41:13.622]  Once your body scan is stored, your wife or you or whoever can get the perfect size belt, the perfect size dress, the perfect suit, and only the richest will have the perfectly tailored suit to their body scan.
[00:41:15.822 --> 00:41:16.182]  See there?
[00:41:16.182 --> 00:41:19.683]  I mean, that's from 12 years ago, and we were able to pull it up for you right there.
[00:41:19.683 --> 00:41:21.864]  We're not making any of this up.
[00:41:21.864 --> 00:41:26.746]  This is a total beast grid of control.
[00:41:26.746 --> 00:41:39.090]  In fact, Amazon announced today that they are now selling more Kindle downloads of eBooks, they've passed that Rubicon, more digital books than paper books.
[00:41:39.090 --> 00:41:40.891]  The problem with that is, in the future,
[00:41:41.892 --> 00:41:51.341]  They can basically change digital books simultaneously and edit things and put them into the memory hole and not have physical copies of books.
[00:41:51.341 --> 00:41:52.802]  So it's very, very dangerous.
[00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:56.606]  I'm all for e-books, but the fact that it's being phased out is dangerous.
[00:41:56.606 --> 00:41:59.689]  And it's gonna be the same thing with clothing lines.
[00:41:59.689 --> 00:42:06.415]  You're not gonna be able in the near future, and what I mean within a decade, to go into most stores and buy new clothes.
[00:42:09.013 --> 00:42:16.402]  It's going to all be online and you're going to go online and shop because clothes are all going to be individually fitted.
[00:42:16.402 --> 00:42:18.465]  You watch!
[00:42:18.465 --> 00:42:22.971]  Just like within three years, more than half the Air Force will be unmanned.
[00:42:22.971 --> 00:42:23.892]  Half of the aircraft.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:34.683]  And they plan by 2025 to have no aircraft but troop carriers and maintenance carrying aircraft, or aircraft that deliver tanks, things like that.
[00:42:34.683 --> 00:42:44.947]  The entire fighting force of attack aircraft and bombers will be robotic, because humans can't take the Gs that a robotic plane can have, and that edge against other enemies, it's gonna be unstoppable.
[00:42:44.947 --> 00:42:51.889]  The point is, then that allows globalists to pre-program everything individually, and now compartmentalize the population
[00:42:52.469 --> 00:43:06.789]  In the government, in the corporate structure, in the military, even more, where A, people don't know what's going on and they can be lied to more easily, and B, the globalists can launch entire robotic false flag attacks and blame it on whoever they want.
[00:43:06.789 --> 00:43:08.911]  They can shut the web off and claim enemies did it.
[00:43:09.926 --> 00:43:27.931]  They can send in a Saudi of 3,000 drone bombers to attack any country they want, and all they've got to have is the robotic assembly lines at the airbases to reload the aircraft and fuel them, and simply have technicians there to make sure all the computers are working.
[00:43:27.931 --> 00:43:30.752]  So they might need 1 20th?
[00:43:30.752 --> 00:43:33.832]  That's some of the Pentagon estimates I've seen.
[00:43:33.832 --> 00:43:35.573]  Don't believe me, just search anything I say.
[00:43:37.250 --> 00:43:39.792]  Because all humans are biological computers.
[00:43:39.792 --> 00:43:41.233]  I'm a biological computer.
[00:43:41.233 --> 00:43:44.294]  My brain is pretty well trained to semi-photographic.
[00:43:44.294 --> 00:43:51.439]  And so you can just take anything I say and search it and find it for yourself.
[00:43:51.439 --> 00:43:54.141]  1 20th of the force they need.
[00:43:54.141 --> 00:44:03.407]  And they'll just be disconnected techs in giant hangers in there working on the robotic aircraft and programming the robotic maintenance droids.
[00:44:04.517 --> 00:44:06.338]  That are in there working on the equipment.
[00:44:06.338 --> 00:44:07.859]  Humans are obsolete.
[00:44:07.859 --> 00:44:16.866]  That's why 10 years ago, in the April issue, 2000, of Wired Magazine, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us, Bill Joy.
[00:44:16.866 --> 00:44:17.967]  You'll want to read that article.
[00:44:17.967 --> 00:44:19.968]  In fact, let's search that for people.
[00:44:19.968 --> 00:44:23.511]  Bill Joy, Why the Future Doesn't Need Us.
[00:44:23.511 --> 00:44:28.474]  And he has a meeting with several hundred top technology leaders and owners, and they just said, they had a discussion.
[00:44:28.474 --> 00:44:29.755]  Do we kill everybody?
[00:44:29.755 --> 00:44:31.296]  We don't need them anymore?
[00:44:31.296 --> 00:44:33.298]  Or do we give them mindless games and entertainment?
[00:44:34.485 --> 00:44:39.067]  And the decision is basically soft kill you, slowly sterilize you, and get rid of your generations that way.
[00:44:39.067 --> 00:44:42.948]  And in the third world, they'll have wars and starvation to get rid of folks.
[00:44:42.948 --> 00:44:44.949]  But we're just not even meant to be here.
[00:44:44.949 --> 00:44:50.411]  This whole Google NSA global grid is an extermination grid in their own words.
[00:44:50.411 --> 00:44:52.792]  And I know you're not gonna listen till it's too late.
[00:44:52.792 --> 00:44:54.533]  I understand most of you won't.
[00:44:54.533 --> 00:44:57.374]  Some people, though, are gonna listen now.
[00:44:57.374 --> 00:44:59.054]  Why the future doesn't need us, Bill Joy.
[00:44:59.054 --> 00:45:02.696]  And was I right about the date, April, yep, April 2000.
[00:45:05.416 --> 00:45:09.818]  I'll blow that up for folks so they can see it.
[00:45:09.818 --> 00:45:11.538]  My little wire fell out here.
[00:45:11.538 --> 00:45:15.720]  Let me plug that back in so I get my audio again.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.761]  But there you have it, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:17.761 --> 00:45:23.663]  Okay, I said I'd take your phone calls, and we'll do that until late after, and then Steve Watson's gonna be joining us.
[00:45:23.663 --> 00:45:29.665]  Let's go ahead and talk to Austin, listening in New York to 1310 AM.
[00:45:29.665 --> 00:45:31.386]  And Austin, good to have you on with us, sir.
[00:45:32.196 --> 00:45:35.558]  Well, Alex, it's so unbelievable to get through.
[00:45:35.558 --> 00:45:46.226]  I've tried so many times, and I'm actually glad that you're kind of all over the place with topics today, because what I wanted to talk about, I wasn't sure if it was going to be what you'd want to hear today.
[00:45:46.226 --> 00:45:48.107]  But first, I just want to thank you and Watson.
[00:45:48.783 --> 00:45:51.164]  And Paul Craig Roberts and all the guys that you have on.
[00:45:51.164 --> 00:45:54.045]  Listen, Austin, I want to thank you, but let me be specific.
[00:45:54.045 --> 00:46:01.088]  Maybe once or twice a week I say, I want to hear from police that have got intel on evacuations in the Gulf.
[00:46:01.088 --> 00:46:03.590]  Or I'll say, I want to hear what you think about a depression.
[00:46:03.590 --> 00:46:08.372]  I mean, if I don't specifically say we're on this topic, it's always wide open.
[00:46:08.372 --> 00:46:18.096]  OK, well, the reason I called about a month ago, you were talking about the interfacing of different police agencies with the federal government to control
[00:46:18.737 --> 00:46:21.539]  population when they have a need.
[00:46:21.539 --> 00:46:33.227]  And you, and you shout it out to law enforcement and military people to call in to kind of add a little bit of foundation to the things you were saying.
[00:46:33.227 --> 00:46:35.748]  And I tried and tried to get in for a couple of days and I couldn't.
[00:46:35.748 --> 00:46:41.972]  I'm a retired lieutenant from New York state, from the correction department.
[00:46:41.972 --> 00:46:45.895]  And I was the regional training lieutenant for the Southern part of New York state.
[00:46:47.020 --> 00:46:51.604]  I was responsible for the in-service training of a couple thousand staff.
[00:46:51.604 --> 00:46:59.810]  And I was also very involved in peace officer status training in New York State and also special ops training.
[00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:03.573]  So I've got a kind of a background in this stuff.
[00:47:03.573 --> 00:47:16.423]  And when you were talking about what the state is being taught to do by the federal government, it all of a sudden clicked things I remembered from my past career, like back in the 70s.
[00:47:17.461 --> 00:47:20.722]  When I was working for the Correctional Department, they had a riot.
[00:47:20.722 --> 00:47:22.422]  I'm sure you've heard of the Attica Riot.
[00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:23.482]  Yes.
[00:47:23.482 --> 00:47:34.844]  And the Correctional Department decided to have what they call a Correctional Emergency Response Team, kind of like Correction's version of SPOT, to deal with prison disturbances.
[00:47:34.844 --> 00:47:38.785]  And it was at a time of fiscal crisis in New York State.
[00:47:38.785 --> 00:47:40.565]  We weren't getting raises and all that kind of stuff.
[00:47:40.565 --> 00:47:41.546]  They had no money.
[00:47:41.546 --> 00:47:43.646]  And yet we were buying all this equipment.
[00:47:43.646 --> 00:47:44.026]  I remember
[00:47:44.858 --> 00:47:48.339]  Us guys asking, like, how do we afford this stuff?
[00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:52.780]  And yet we can't run our prisons and we have to save paperclips.
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.781]  Oh, it's federal money!
[00:47:54.781 --> 00:48:03.644]  And I'm like, federal money being used to buy equipment for state correction response teams?
[00:48:03.644 --> 00:48:13.987]  And I remember one of my supervisors telling me, yeah, well, the agreement is that in time of need, we will interface during civil disruptions
[00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:24.213]  And again, they take money from the state, they send it back, and they make the state dependent on the feds.
[00:48:24.213 --> 00:48:39.705]  That's why the feds lobbied at the state legislatures in the last 20 years, to where when states seize drug money, a state or local agency, they don't get to keep any of it, but if you give it to the feds, the states get 85% back, making you always
[00:48:40.646 --> 00:48:42.908]  Do drug raids under federal control.
[00:48:42.908 --> 00:48:46.011]  Everything to destroy states and local control.
[00:48:46.011 --> 00:48:46.892]  Go ahead.
[00:48:46.892 --> 00:48:48.993]  And I, and I, and I, I watched guys.
[00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:54.158]  I mean, like I said, I worked for, I worked for like 30 plus years for the, for the state.
[00:48:54.158 --> 00:48:59.483]  So I, I saw a lot of stuff and I, I met a lot of guys and I just paid attention.
[00:48:59.483 --> 00:49:02.926]  And I remember thinking to myself, this stuff isn't legit.
[00:49:02.926 --> 00:49:06.569]  You know, this is something not, that's not right about all this stuff.
[00:49:06.569 --> 00:49:07.670]  And, and I, you know,
[00:49:09.091 --> 00:49:14.914]  One thing that happened, actually almost 20 years after that, you remember the Woodstock concert?
[00:49:14.914 --> 00:49:15.474]  Yes.
[00:49:15.474 --> 00:49:19.996]  Well they had a 25th anniversary concert at Woodstock in New York State.
[00:49:19.996 --> 00:49:23.077]  I remember a bunch of anarchist burn stuff.
[00:49:23.077 --> 00:49:31.381]  Right, well what happened, what was really funny was, FEMA, which is the State Emergency Management Organization, New York State's version of FEMA,
[00:49:32.807 --> 00:49:49.140]  They set up this command center, and I, at the time I was a sergeant, I hadn't been promoted to lieutenant yet, I got tapped to sit in this command post to just be ready for whatever during this big concert, because they knew there was going to be lots and lots of people.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:50.801]  And it was unbelievable.
[00:49:50.801 --> 00:50:00.249]  They had federal agencies, Civil Air Patrol was there, and they had set up this scenario that they fortunately never had to use.
[00:50:01.494 --> 00:50:20.158]  In one of the maximum security prisons in New York, they had set up a staging area in the back recreation yard using military surplus cots, blankets and pillows, where if they needed to arrest mass numbers of people, they were going to be able to take them to
[00:50:20.697 --> 00:50:24.741]  The Rear Recreation Yard of a New York State Prison to house them.
[00:50:24.741 --> 00:50:34.729]  And really, that's a compartmentalized concentration camp drill, and then evidence later came out, but you say you were there, that those were provocateur anarchists that set the few fires.
[00:50:34.729 --> 00:50:35.930]  Stay there, I want to come back to you.
[00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:39.854]  I know we've got a lot of other callers, but this is key information.
[00:50:39.854 --> 00:50:44.037]  And now, at the G20 in the U.S., England, Canada, it's the same.
[00:50:45.526 --> 00:50:53.717]  They hire provocateurs that the rest of the police don't know are provocateurs to sell the media, the police, everyone that citizens have to be arrested.
[00:50:53.717 --> 00:51:00.005]  And whether it was the RNC in 2004 or other events, they then take them to these emergency FEMA centers.
[00:51:00.526 --> 00:51:01.727]  Global meltdowns.
[00:51:01.727 --> 00:51:02.947]  Massive unemployment.
[00:51:02.947 --> 00:51:03.908]  Endless wars.
[00:51:03.908 --> 00:51:05.409]  A new currency crisis.
[00:51:05.409 --> 00:51:07.370]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:09.751]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[00:51:09.751 --> 00:51:11.312]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[00:51:11.312 --> 00:51:13.313]  To get prepared for hard times ahead?

[00:52:00.772 --> 00:52:05.734]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.734 --> 00:52:06.734]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.734 --> 00:52:09.155]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.155 --> 00:52:10.175]  A republic.
[00:52:10.175 --> 00:52:12.836]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.836 --> 00:52:15.097]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.097 --> 00:52:17.118]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.118 --> 00:52:18.798]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.798 --> 00:52:20.119]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.119 --> 00:52:20.719]  Children?
[00:52:20.719 --> 00:52:21.859]  Our education?
[00:52:21.859 --> 00:52:22.680]  Our money?
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.341]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.701 --> 00:52:30.406]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.406 --> 00:52:31.668]  You're being warned!

[00:52:32.689 --> 00:52:33.851]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.851 --> 00:52:34.772]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.772 --> 00:52:35.653]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.653 --> 00:52:38.177]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.

[00:54:42.984 --> 00:54:44.145]  Same thing in Wisconsin.
[00:54:45.632 --> 00:54:48.074]  It's all exposed in my film, The Obama Deception.
[00:54:48.074 --> 00:54:50.977]  It is exposed in this documentary that they've been censoring.

[00:55:02.468 --> 00:55:07.253]  Part 2 of it, it basically covers the most up-to-date info, is Fall of the Republic.
[00:55:07.967 --> 00:55:09.468]  This is part two to the Obama deception.
[00:55:09.468 --> 00:55:13.672]  They're all available at InfoWars.com on the online shopping cart.
[00:55:13.672 --> 00:55:15.594]  And this is complex stuff.
[00:55:15.594 --> 00:55:17.736]  This is a long-term strategic takeover.
[00:55:17.736 --> 00:55:25.423]  It took me deep research to figure out that Google wasn't just with the government, it is the government, but a corporate government taking over.
[00:55:25.423 --> 00:55:28.986]  Now it's mainstream news in the Washington Post, because they're just throwing it in your face.
[00:55:30.134 --> 00:55:40.327]  And we need to warn police and military now because I can't tell you how many phone calls, how many emails, how many people in uniform, police officers, TSA workers.
[00:55:41.801 --> 00:55:54.711]  Off-duty, you know, city employees all over the country have said, I didn't understand what was going on at work until I saw your film, and everything in there I'd already seen, but pieces of it.
[00:55:54.711 --> 00:55:55.772]  How do you know all this?
[00:55:55.772 --> 00:55:57.033]  Well, I did the research.
[00:55:57.033 --> 00:56:01.816]  The globalists have got millions of people working for them, so they've got to write up what they're doing.
[00:56:01.816 --> 00:56:07.381]  They always put it in a palatable way, and they always spin it like it's good, but when you know history,
[00:56:08.041 --> 00:56:11.903]  And then you get the deeper congressional hearings on Rex 84 from the 80s.
[00:56:11.903 --> 00:56:13.504]  That's when we found out the plan.
[00:56:13.504 --> 00:56:14.945]  Total martial law.
[00:56:14.945 --> 00:56:16.666]  Millions of people to be arrested.
[00:56:16.666 --> 00:56:18.326]  But first they've got to drill everybody.
[00:56:18.326 --> 00:56:20.968]  So they'll say, martial law is coming for the flu.
[00:56:20.968 --> 00:56:21.908]  Then it doesn't happen.
[00:56:21.908 --> 00:56:23.949]  But you've been drilled to accept it.
[00:56:23.949 --> 00:56:25.010]  The public's been drilled.
[00:56:26.963 --> 00:56:28.804]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[00:56:28.804 --> 00:56:32.645]  It's a slow incremental takeover towards the financial collapse.
[00:56:32.645 --> 00:56:34.665]  So now we're coming to the wall here.
[00:56:34.665 --> 00:56:35.665]  We're coming to the cliff.
[00:56:35.665 --> 00:56:37.306]  We're coming to the end of the road.
[00:56:37.306 --> 00:56:39.727]  And that's why it's getting so crystal clear.
[00:56:39.727 --> 00:56:41.867]  Austin, any other info?
[00:56:41.867 --> 00:56:44.048]  Yeah, just a couple of quick things, Alex.
[00:56:44.048 --> 00:56:48.109]  I just appreciate you letting me come back on.
[00:56:48.109 --> 00:56:55.631]  One of the things I taught at the Correction Academy in Albany, New York for years was the code and canon of ethics in law enforcement.
[00:56:56.132 --> 00:56:59.975]  And I noticed that there was this really weird disconnect.
[00:56:59.975 --> 00:57:07.182]  That a lot of the people in my training sessions considered ethics not to be an individual thing.
[00:57:07.182 --> 00:57:17.170]  That it was a department that was responsible for the ethical operation and that the officers as individuals were just supposed to... I called it the Eichmann Defense.
[00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:18.992]  I was just following orders.
[00:57:18.992 --> 00:57:19.772]  You know?
[00:57:19.772 --> 00:57:23.756]  And as long as they were following orders, then they were doing the right thing.
[00:57:24.355 --> 00:57:28.658]  And I would just reach out and speak to my law enforcement brothers.
[00:57:28.658 --> 00:57:31.660]  That ethics is individual.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:33.561]  It is not corporate.
[00:57:33.561 --> 00:57:45.309]  And the only way that the monster New World Order can win is if everybody steps in line with them.
[00:57:45.595 --> 00:57:46.675]  That's right.
[00:57:46.675 --> 00:57:54.998]  Peace officers were always trained to act individually, to follow the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, to have that code, and to operate with autonomy.
[00:57:54.998 --> 00:57:59.860]  But now it's corporatized with a structure where you do what you're told.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:12.664]  And the New World Order and the big, big takeover cannot be successful without the guys where the tire meets the road.
[00:58:13.405 --> 00:58:23.711]  And if you will not follow unlawful orders, if you realize that ethics is individual, and just don't do it, they can't win.
[00:58:23.711 --> 00:58:24.752]  God bless you, Austin.
[00:58:24.752 --> 00:58:25.472]  Call back again.
[00:58:25.472 --> 00:58:26.433]  I'm glad you got through.
[00:58:26.433 --> 00:58:31.016]  So many great peace officers and guardians of the Republic out there.
[00:58:31.016 --> 00:58:39.261]  And that's why individuals, as citizens, have to speak up and say when things are wrong, so that police and military and government recognize what they're doing.

[01:00:27.158 --> 01:00:30.499]  Len Spencer from the front lines of the border collapsing in Arizona.
[01:00:30.499 --> 01:00:33.261]  One of the leading experts out there.
[01:00:33.261 --> 01:00:35.041]  He'll be joining us.
[01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:37.722]  Extremely informative intel coming up.
[01:00:37.722 --> 01:00:39.463]  We're continuing with your phone calls right now.
[01:00:39.463 --> 01:00:42.304]  Steve Watson comes up for two segments here in just a moment.
[01:00:42.304 --> 01:00:44.185]  Let's talk to Ariel in New York.
[01:00:44.185 --> 01:00:46.586]  Ariel, you're on the air.
[01:00:46.586 --> 01:00:48.147]  Yes, hello Alex Jones.
[01:00:48.147 --> 01:00:49.827]  My friends call me A.R.
[01:00:49.827 --> 01:00:51.248]  and my friend Will.
[01:00:51.963 --> 01:00:56.146]  He's the one that always told me about this, your show, and told me how to call in.
[01:00:56.146 --> 01:01:00.790]  And he's always telling me and all my friends about high fructose corn syrup.
[01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:05.293]  I just wanted you to just tell me really quickly, what's so wrong with the high fructose corn syrup?
[01:01:05.293 --> 01:01:07.015]  Because it's in everything.
[01:01:07.015 --> 01:01:10.777]  It's in ketchup, it's in everything.
[01:01:10.777 --> 01:01:12.139]  Alright, well let's cover what we know.
[01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:18.025]  Eighty plus percent of the corn in this country for the last decade has been GMO.
[01:01:18.025 --> 01:01:25.172]  There's different varieties of it, but mainly it's to be pesticide resistant so it doesn't die when it gets sprayed with pesticides.
[01:01:25.172 --> 01:01:31.998]  It then absorbs the pesticides and concentrates in it, and in all the studies of these GMO corns with rats, it kills them.
[01:01:31.998 --> 01:01:33.039]  It causes organ failure.
[01:01:33.934 --> 01:02:02.084]  So, you've got that poison in the corn syrup and government has reported itself that upwards of half to a third, depending on which batch they test, of all major corn syrup containing products has high levels of mercury, very high levels, because they also spray toxic waste, the leftovers from oil production, oil refining, whatever's left over, they call it fertilizer and spray the toxic waste on crops.
[01:02:03.024 --> 01:02:04.565]  Wow, that's just unfortunate.
[01:02:32.884 --> 01:02:35.186]  And I just have one final question.
[01:02:35.186 --> 01:02:39.149]  You know, because I know health is one half of the battle and that's why.
[01:02:39.149 --> 01:02:40.210]  It's good, I'm glad.
[01:02:58.442 --> 01:02:59.202]  Yes, thanks.
[01:02:59.202 --> 01:03:01.744]  Thanks for telling me about the ASPR team too, you know.
[01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:03.344]  He never mentioned that to me.
[01:03:03.344 --> 01:03:05.685]  He always mentioned the floor and high fructose.
[01:03:05.685 --> 01:03:15.470]  But my final question is, you know, there's so many people who just don't care about what's happening, maybe until it happens.
[01:03:15.470 --> 01:03:20.812]  When do you think it will be the time, the exact moment, for the people who really don't care about it?
[01:03:20.812 --> 01:03:24.174]  Because you know, there's people that do care like you and they're taking action now.
[01:03:25.605 --> 01:03:34.531]  Well, I mean, it's all incremental.
[01:03:34.531 --> 01:03:35.912]  It's all part of a process.
[01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:40.976]  And the Bible talks about people being spiritually blind and not being spiritually enlightened.
[01:03:42.177 --> 01:03:48.524]  And so what happens is they are deceived and they're given a great delusion.
[01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:52.668]  And so it doesn't matter if half the kids on their block got cancer.
[01:03:52.668 --> 01:03:54.270]  They just think that's normal.
[01:03:54.270 --> 01:04:00.697]  And they want to care about sitcoms and the New York Yankees and acting cool with their buddies at the bar.
[01:04:01.738 --> 01:04:08.727]  It's too heavy for them to believe the government's poisoning them and that there's a soft kill operation to sterilize us.
[01:04:08.727 --> 01:04:14.975]  And so they're just already immersed in death to the point of they've just given up.
[01:04:14.975 --> 01:04:16.897]  We don't need the majority.
[01:04:17.714 --> 01:04:30.944]  We need a active, aggressive, tireless, focused minority of truth lovers and freedom lovers and life lovers who are willing to tell the truth and stand up and speak out.
[01:04:36.138 --> 01:04:37.038]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[01:04:37.038 --> 01:04:38.179]  I appreciate your call, Ariel.
[01:04:38.179 --> 01:04:39.059]  Good to hear from you.
[01:04:39.059 --> 01:04:45.863]  We'll get to Alex, Matt, Rosa, Maria, Todd, and others coming up after Steve Watson is with us on several key issues.
[01:04:45.863 --> 01:04:50.245]  Straight ahead, this is the one, the only GCN Radio Network.
[01:04:50.245 --> 01:04:51.045]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:04:51.045 --> 01:04:53.567]  GCNLive.com is, of course, the website.
[01:04:53.567 --> 01:04:55.648]  We'll be right back after this quick break.

[01:06:00.009 --> 01:06:04.572]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:04.572 --> 01:06:05.473]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.473 --> 01:06:08.896]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:08.896 --> 01:06:09.756]  Number 2.
[01:06:09.756 --> 01:06:14.660]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:15.400]  It's true.
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.264]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.264 --> 01:06:21.105]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.105 --> 01:06:24.687]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:24.687 --> 01:06:28.390]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:28.590 --> 01:06:29.370]  Number 4.
[01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:32.131]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.131 --> 01:06:35.812]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:35.812 --> 01:06:36.612]  Number 5.
[01:06:36.612 --> 01:06:40.753]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:40.753 --> 01:06:45.815]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:08:05.802 --> 01:08:11.833]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:14.377]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:08:16.989 --> 01:08:19.389]  Alright, eight minutes into hour number two.
[01:08:19.389 --> 01:08:24.430]  Glenn Spencer coming up in the next hour from the front lines of the collapsing border in Arizona.
[01:08:24.430 --> 01:08:26.231]  And he says things are heating up.
[01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:30.952]  Of course, 17 killed in a machine gun attack on a birthday party yesterday.
[01:08:30.952 --> 01:08:33.092]  A few days before that, a big car bombing.
[01:08:33.092 --> 01:08:38.573]  It is getting really serious as the failed state, Mexico, sinks into the mud.
[01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:42.734]  Their corrupt government and police fighting with the other drug dealers over the spoils.
[01:08:42.734 --> 01:08:43.534]  That is coming up.
[01:08:44.969 --> 01:08:57.413]  Steve Watson has a key article that just went live at PrisonPlanet.com, Top Secret America, Google launches cover-up of Google Spies story.
[01:08:57.413 --> 01:09:00.614]  Google launches cover-up of Google Spies story.
[01:09:00.614 --> 01:09:11.257]  Now, we said search the term yesterday, Google Spies, to link to an article and past articles we wrote years ago saying Google was basically an NSA front.
[01:09:12.011 --> 01:09:13.272]  But a corporate government.
[01:09:13.272 --> 01:09:15.973]  This isn't the government taking over corporations.
[01:09:15.973 --> 01:09:21.055]  This is the government merging with corporations.
[01:09:21.055 --> 01:09:24.196]  And here's one of the stories we wrote four years ago.
[01:09:24.196 --> 01:09:26.257]  Paul Watson, ex-agent.
[01:09:26.257 --> 01:09:29.258]  CIA seed money helped launch Google.
[01:09:29.258 --> 01:09:31.679]  Still goes further than before in detailing ties.
[01:09:31.679 --> 01:09:34.060]  Names Google's CIA liaison.
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:36.861]  So here's that article from four years ago.
[01:09:38.257 --> 01:09:39.459]  And why is this so important?
[01:09:39.459 --> 01:09:40.180]  Here's the article.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.641]  Top Secret America.
[01:09:41.641 --> 01:09:44.565]  A hidden world growing beyond control.
[01:09:44.565 --> 01:09:44.585]  854,000 854,000
[01:09:53.854 --> 01:09:54.034]  That's
[01:10:12.864 --> 01:10:29.815]  Parts of the Defense Department, Army, Navy, Marines, Air Force, liaison Dan, the FBI, state governments, threat fusion centers, the license plate reading cameras, the cell phones tracking you, the Google software listening to you inside your house with a microphone, keyword dating, everything.
[01:10:29.815 --> 01:10:34.378]  Google admits they do that, but say don't worry, humans aren't listening, computers are listening in your house.
[01:10:34.378 --> 01:10:36.980]  That was four years ago they admitted that.
[01:10:36.980 --> 01:10:38.922]  Headline, in fact search it, Google admits
[01:10:41.656 --> 01:10:47.278]  Microphones on computer listening to you in your home.
[01:10:47.278 --> 01:10:49.038]  So think of the magnitude of this.
[01:10:49.038 --> 01:10:57.181]  That's why Google, it comes out all over the world, has their little Google trucks, white vans going around, videotaping your street for street view.
[01:10:57.181 --> 01:10:59.741]  That's only the front cover.
[01:10:59.741 --> 01:11:00.822]  Okay?
[01:11:00.822 --> 01:11:03.683]  Now they have GPS coordinates via the census.
[01:11:03.683 --> 01:11:04.683]  Same thing was done in Europe.
[01:11:06.223 --> 01:11:12.127]  This is for a real-world 360 map similar to cyberspace but in the real world.
[01:11:12.127 --> 01:11:13.949]  This is what the Pentagon said over a decade ago.
[01:11:13.949 --> 01:11:15.450]  That's how I knew about this.
[01:11:15.450 --> 01:11:17.672]  This stuff's all hidden in plain view.
[01:11:17.672 --> 01:11:28.260]  And Google drives around and has put up masts in every major city that just grab all the wireless digital transmissions from your iPhone, your laptop, your wireless
[01:11:29.537 --> 01:11:43.984]  I mean, I've got an ABC News story where they're charging thousands of people a year now for videotaping police from 100 yards away, the cops come and arrest them for eavesdropping, wiretapping, when there's no perception of privacy, there's no law violated, they still charge you.
[01:11:43.984 --> 01:11:47.746]  And the judges still tell the juries to convict you.
[01:11:47.746 --> 01:11:53.069]  When on its face, it's being thrown out of court over and over again, they don't care.
[01:11:53.069 --> 01:11:58.072]  So they are going to let Google, for the NSA, go out and steal all the data,
[01:11:59.156 --> 01:12:02.718]  And the courts just ruled last week Google can do that in the US and Australia.
[01:12:02.718 --> 01:12:04.299]  Oh yeah, you're allowed to steal everybody's data.
[01:12:04.299 --> 01:12:07.301]  Why is Google allowed to do things that nobody else can?
[01:12:07.301 --> 01:12:10.943]  Why are they allowed to digitize new books and put them on the web?
[01:12:10.943 --> 01:12:12.484]  And the publishers can't stop them.
[01:12:12.484 --> 01:12:14.745]  Because they are the new corporate government.
[01:12:14.745 --> 01:12:22.349]  So corporations, the elite corporations who aren't free market, they are becoming the government.
[01:12:22.349 --> 01:12:25.431]  And Steve Watson wrote an excellent article about this that
[01:12:26.775 --> 01:12:31.920]  The term Google Spies was the hottest search and the hottest search, those are two different terms.
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:35.783]  It was volcanic, that's their highest rating.
[01:12:35.783 --> 01:12:48.014]  And we have screenshots of that we'll put up from his article because he has the screenshots in it in his story, Top Secret America, Google launches cover up over Google Spies story.
[01:12:48.014 --> 01:12:52.658]  But I wanted to read this quote from John Quincy Adams, John Adams' son.
[01:12:55.734 --> 01:13:07.658]  Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air.
[01:13:07.658 --> 01:13:12.519]  And that is the final statement in this great article written by Andrew Steele.
[01:13:12.519 --> 01:13:14.220]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:19.421]  Deleted Obama deception movie restored after Google nailed with calculated search blitz.
[01:13:19.421 --> 01:13:24.523]  But the point is Google is now censoring terms that expose their spying.
[01:13:25.543 --> 01:13:34.309]  Their search system is a fraud, and it's not just to predict what's going to happen in the future by tracking trends, but to manipulate the outcomes of societal movements.
[01:13:34.309 --> 01:13:36.251]  They want you to read about Mel Gibson.
[01:13:36.251 --> 01:13:38.052]  They want you to read about Lindsay Lohan.
[01:13:38.052 --> 01:13:41.695]  They want to make you read about Vander Sloot.
[01:13:41.695 --> 01:13:53.463]  They want to make you be obsessed with the New York Yankees owner dying, instead of real issues that affect you and your family, like the global depression being engineered by design, or private corporations becoming the government.
[01:13:54.773 --> 01:14:06.259]  Just a decade ago, there were no more than 5,000 people, Congress reports, intelligence community, maybe 10,000, depending if you look at the intelligence breakdowns differently, but a fraction that had this highest level security clearance.
[01:14:06.259 --> 01:14:10.701]  Now, 800 plus thousand private corporate shills have it.
[01:14:10.701 --> 01:14:11.702]  Let's go to Steve Watson.
[01:14:11.702 --> 01:14:15.224]  We'll have him with us until about 45 after, then I'll get into the other news and your calls.
[01:14:15.224 --> 01:14:18.285]  Steve Watson, good to have you here with us today, sir.
[01:14:18.285 --> 01:14:19.106]  Good to be back, Howie.
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:32.107]  Well, I tell you, we certainly analyzed this correctly in the last decade, and now it's just admitted that Google, Oracle, and others are at the very top of this private corporate takeover of the planet.
[01:14:32.107 --> 01:14:37.090]  Your government is now transferring most government activities over to these private operations.
[01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:39.771]  I mean, this is incredible.
[01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:42.493]  Yeah, so I mean, it's like you were saying yesterday.
[01:14:42.493 --> 01:14:46.495]  It's an open secret now, and, you know, people say
[01:14:47.665 --> 01:14:49.446]  People try and link Google.
[01:14:49.446 --> 01:14:54.689]  They say Google has, you know, extensive links to intelligence, to CIA and NSA.
[01:14:54.689 --> 01:14:56.930]  But it's like we were saying yesterday.
[01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:58.070]  It doesn't just have links.
[01:14:58.070 --> 01:15:04.214]  It is... It has become part of the intelligence apparatus.
[01:15:04.214 --> 01:15:09.856]  It's... You know... We've written... We've written articles previously.
[01:15:09.856 --> 01:15:12.538]  You know, multiple articles documenting this.
[01:15:12.538 --> 01:15:16.640]  And I've linked them all today in my article today, which is...
[01:15:17.907 --> 01:15:22.732]  Top Secret America Google launches cover-up of the Google Spy story.
[01:15:22.732 --> 01:15:38.748]  So we've taken what's been unfolding in the past few days, but we've also contextualized it with all the previous articles we've written, which, if you go to this article, they're all linked at the bottom, and you can read them and get them out to everyone.
[01:15:40.794 --> 01:15:55.306]  It's important to understand, especially this week with the Washington Post story coming out, it's important to understand the relationship that Google, not just Google, but others, you know, other communication companies have.
[01:15:55.306 --> 01:16:00.109]  Because it's part of the overall attack on the free internet.
[01:16:00.109 --> 01:16:07.115]  It's part of, it's all linked into the Pentagon, the federal government, the fusion centers, everything.
[01:16:08.106 --> 01:16:18.529]  They're all linked in together, and once you understand how big that is, you understand how hard we have to fight to keep the free internet.
[01:16:18.529 --> 01:16:36.975]  So, I mean, if we just go over, uh, if we just go over Google's links, or Google's, uh, intrinsic links to the intelligence apparatus from these previous articles, uh, earlier this year, it was revealed that
[01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:47.079]  Google specifically has a government arm that works directly with the government and the intelligence agencies.
[01:16:47.079 --> 01:16:55.143]  So the public side, what we see as the search engines, the street view, everything like that, that's one side of it.
[01:16:55.143 --> 01:17:06.030]  But behind that, there's a whole other side of it, which is specifically set up to work with the intelligence apparatus.
[01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:07.891]  It was revealed earlier this year
[01:17:08.962 --> 01:17:16.826]  That they were setting up a sort of spy force to work directly with the NSA.
[01:17:16.826 --> 01:17:24.969]  And the pretext that was given for this was that Google suffered a cyber attack.
[01:17:24.969 --> 01:17:34.573]  Now obviously, that was used as an excuse for the government to come in and say, right, you've suffered a cyber attack.
[01:17:34.573 --> 01:17:37.775]  We don't want America to suffer a cyber attack, so we need to work with you.
[01:17:39.099 --> 01:17:41.020]  Behind the scenes.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:57.387]  Um, so they basically set up a spy force to, uh, with the NSA to, and if you go to this article entitled, Google re-establishes relationship with government spies, it's broken down in there.
[01:17:58.047 --> 01:17:58.227]  That's
[01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:18.902]  Who can even have a license to be an IT professional?
[01:18:18.902 --> 01:18:21.943]  Everyone under the Cybersecurity Act will be licensed by the government.
[01:18:21.943 --> 01:18:27.726]  Even ISPs that have a hundred or more customers must be wired through the NSA.
[01:18:27.726 --> 01:18:37.649]  The FCC is saying everything on your computer will be controlled by black box software that filters what you can see and tracks everything you're looking at.
[01:18:37.649 --> 01:18:42.011]  I mean, this makes Chinese-style net censorship look tame in comparison.
[01:18:42.631 --> 01:18:51.333]  And so they just used the claim that China had kicked Google out, and they've now let them back in, as the pretext to say, oh, we're establishing ties to the NSA.
[01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:53.234]  When they are NSA software.
[01:18:53.234 --> 01:18:56.455]  It was created by the NSA.
[01:18:56.455 --> 01:18:57.115]  Yeah.
[01:18:57.115 --> 01:19:07.198]  People that previously worked with the CIA and the NSA have just, you know, hopped over, become leading players at Google in this sort of government arm of it.
[01:19:08.641 --> 01:19:12.064]  This is all detailed in the article that I've linked to you.
[01:19:12.064 --> 01:19:24.154]  And you've got to remember that the NSA was, you know, publicly outed as the intelligence agency that was monitoring, you know, everyone's computers and telephones.
[01:19:24.154 --> 01:19:32.942]  And then, earlier this year, it was just announced that Google's going to set up this spy force directly with them.
[01:19:32.942 --> 01:19:36.125]  So they're just basically, you know, revealing what
[01:19:36.718 --> 01:19:37.458]  We already know.
[01:19:37.458 --> 01:19:40.020]  It's an open secret.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:54.587]  And we have Google that owns YouTube deleting the Obama deception and then restoring the Obama deception and then now we have them censoring all these search terms that expose them for what they really are which is a huge story.
[01:19:54.587 --> 01:19:57.429]  Let's talk about that when we come back with Steve Watson.
[01:19:57.429 --> 01:19:58.969]  This is key information.
[01:19:58.969 --> 01:19:59.510]  Straight ahead.
[01:20:00.922 --> 01:20:01.482]  Question.
[01:20:01.482 --> 01:20:02.622]  What would you rather drink?
[01:20:02.622 --> 01:20:06.183]  Acidic water, which burns holes in your body and causes loss of bone mass?
[01:20:06.183 --> 01:20:09.944]  Or alkaline water, which promotes high energy and vibrant health?
[01:20:09.944 --> 01:20:11.085]  The answer is clear.
[01:20:11.085 --> 01:20:16.026]  And if you're drinking acidic water, you're helping cancer cells and bacteria to grow out of control.
[01:20:16.026 --> 01:20:20.787]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals.
[01:20:21.087 --> 01:20:28.194]  Using plasma pH drops is the best way to alkalize your water and help you get rid of acid and regain your health and energy.
[01:20:28.194 --> 01:20:33.139]  Simply put 10 drops in the water you drink to raise the pH to a healthy alkaline level.
[01:20:33.139 --> 01:20:37.924]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[01:20:37.924 --> 01:20:40.987]  Disease organisms like bacteria, viruses, or cancer
[01:20:41.127 --> 01:20:41.508]  That's right.
[01:21:01.055 --> 01:21:06.019]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:21:06.019 --> 01:21:07.019]  What have we got?
[01:21:07.019 --> 01:21:09.461]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:21:09.461 --> 01:21:10.462]  A republic.
[01:21:10.462 --> 01:21:13.124]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:21:13.124 --> 01:21:15.386]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:21:15.386 --> 01:21:17.407]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:21:17.407 --> 01:21:19.088]  So they think they own our land?
[01:21:19.088 --> 01:21:20.409]  They think they own our water?
[01:21:20.409 --> 01:21:21.010]  Children?
[01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.151]  Our education?
[01:21:22.151 --> 01:21:22.971]  Our money?
[01:21:22.971 --> 01:21:26.634]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:21:26.974 --> 01:21:31.940]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:32.981]  We have the facts.
[01:21:32.981 --> 01:21:34.122]  We have the Constitution.
[01:21:34.122 --> 01:21:35.044]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:21:35.044 --> 01:21:35.925]  We have common law.
[01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:38.448]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:38.448 --> 01:21:42.232]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:21:42.332 --> 01:21:47.298]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:21:47.298 --> 01:21:48.780]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.881]  Don't tread on me.
[01:21:49.881 --> 01:21:56.769]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:22:02.227 --> 01:22:05.609]  Hi, I'm Mark Craighead, founder of Crossbreed Holsters.
[01:22:05.609 --> 01:22:13.793]  I designed our top-selling holster, the SuperTuck Deluxe, to solve the problems of being poked, pinched, and gouged while carrying concealed.
[01:22:13.793 --> 01:22:19.095]  The SuperTuck Deluxe is the most comfortable, most concealable holster on the market today.
[01:22:19.095 --> 01:22:22.077]  We offer a two-week free trial and a lifetime warranty.

[01:22:30.581 --> 01:22:31.822]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.822 --> 01:22:36.385]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:36.385 --> 01:22:42.209]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:42.209 --> 01:22:45.851]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:45.851 --> 01:22:48.673]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:48.673 --> 01:22:53.616]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:53.616 --> 01:22:53.897]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:53.897 --> 01:22:55.278]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.881 --> 01:23:04.264]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:23:04.264 --> 01:23:08.167]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:23:08.167 --> 01:23:11.890]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:16.834]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water.
[01:23:17.054 --> 01:23:17.314]  I think?
[01:23:33.206 --> 01:23:38.349]  You'll receive a shower filter, a fluoride filter, or two sport Berkey bottles absolutely free.
[01:23:38.349 --> 01:23:48.095]  BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com would like to offer GCN listeners 5% off all ceramic filter systems and ship all orders over $50 free of charge.

[01:23:50.656 --> 01:23:52.617]  That's BigBerkeyWaterFilters.com.
[01:23:52.617 --> 01:23:53.398]  Or call 1-877-99-BERKEY.
[01:23:53.398 --> 01:23:54.018]  That's 1-877-99-BERKEY today.
[01:24:12.683 --> 01:24:27.769]  Okay, let's go back to Steve Watson.
[01:24:27.769 --> 01:24:32.691]  Steve's shifting gears into our own little war with Google.
[01:24:32.691 --> 01:24:40.854]  I noticed yesterday in the top ten searches, and we have screenshots of this, the Washington Post's Top Secret America was one of the top.
[01:24:40.854 --> 01:24:41.374]  Steve, can you hear me?
[01:24:42.414 --> 01:24:42.574]  Yep.
[01:24:42.574 --> 01:24:43.515]  Okay, great.
[01:24:43.515 --> 01:24:50.858]  I noticed that Top Secret America was one of the top searches.
[01:24:50.858 --> 01:24:56.521]  That was also deleted, and if you searched, it was nowhere in there, so it said cannot be found.
[01:24:56.521 --> 01:25:08.187]  And they knocked out our top search, Obama Spies, and so this shows they are actively in there blocking people finding out about how they're an NSA front.
[01:25:09.963 --> 01:25:20.025]  Yeah, and the other thing to point out about that is, um, some people have said that, well, you know, the terms are just dropping out.
[01:25:20.025 --> 01:25:33.589]  But, you know, there's no way that they're just dropping out, because if you go to the screenshots, which are in my article today, the top article on Prison Planet, take a look at the screenshots in there.
[01:25:33.589 --> 01:25:38.770]  It shows you, you know, the times where people began to search these terms, Google Spies, etc.
[01:25:40.425 --> 01:25:50.728]  It shows you the spike in traffic, and it also shows you all the LinkedIn news articles, all the LinkedIn blog posts.
[01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:52.288]  That's the effect that it has.
[01:25:52.288 --> 01:25:58.030]  People start picking up on it, and people start writing about it on their blogs.
[01:25:58.030 --> 01:26:03.492]  And, you know, this term Google Spies, which was linked to the story we wrote yesterday,
[01:26:05.484 --> 01:26:10.566]  We asked, you know, all the listeners and everyone to search that to get it to the top of the trends chart.
[01:26:10.566 --> 01:26:12.887]  It went to the top.
[01:26:12.887 --> 01:26:14.908]  Half an hour later, it was nowhere to be seen.
[01:26:14.908 --> 01:26:22.091]  And if you searched for it, there were no linked news articles, there were no linked blog posts.
[01:26:22.091 --> 01:26:33.957]  Which is impossible because, as you can see from the screenshots, there were already, you know, loads of news articles and blog posts about this story.
[01:26:33.957 --> 01:26:34.917]  So that means that
[01:26:36.804 --> 01:26:55.358]  Somebody who has access to Google Trends is going in there knocking out these search terms that we're asking people to put in to elevate these important stories above the other meaningless stuff that's in there.
[01:26:55.358 --> 01:27:04.405]  And the fact that the terms that we're asking our listeners and readers to search are getting up to number one so quickly
[01:27:05.322 --> 01:27:22.260]  And as you said, the Washington Post expose, which is a two-year investigation, um, into, basically, it compiles everything that we already really know, the open secret.
[01:27:22.260 --> 01:27:27.226]  But that is a, that was a major report, that was at number nine when we screenshotted it, where the
[01:27:28.338 --> 01:27:32.904]  The term Google Spy that we asked our listeners and readers to search was at number one.
[01:27:32.904 --> 01:27:35.066]  So that shows the effect that this can have.
[01:27:35.066 --> 01:27:44.758]  The snowball effect, you know, where people are picking it up, people are writing about it, linking to our original stories.
[01:27:47.571 --> 01:27:50.313]  Well, that's exactly what's happening, Steve.
[01:27:50.313 --> 01:27:52.834]  And today, I want to do it again.
[01:27:52.834 --> 01:27:54.055]  I'm not going to do this all the time.
[01:27:54.055 --> 01:27:56.276]  And I think it's important to listeners not spam.
[01:27:56.276 --> 01:28:00.978]  I don't think people should use a robot or a system that just keeps reloading it.
[01:28:00.978 --> 01:28:04.940]  Just yourself, you know, a few times today, because I think that's all it takes.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:06.161]  We have so many listeners.
[01:28:06.161 --> 01:28:07.142]  Go search the term
[01:28:08.305 --> 01:28:27.470]  Google launches, Google launches, and then that might make it past their censors for a few more hours as well, but Google launches, and then that will take them to the story you've written, Top Secret America, Google launches cover-up of Google Spy's story.
[01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:31.051]  So just search the term Google launches.
[01:28:31.051 --> 01:28:34.392]  G-O-O-G-L-E-L-A-U-N-C-H-E-S.
[01:28:35.592 --> 01:28:56.141]  If everybody will search the term Google launches and then they'll find the fact that this story is top secret America Google launches cover-up of Google spies story then they can see that Google is tied to this top secret America corporate takeover this corporate coup d'etat of our entire infrastructure and it's an unfair trade advantage as well.
[01:28:56.821 --> 01:29:00.864]  And so we can really route these people if we realize that we can.
[01:29:00.864 --> 01:29:03.106]  We can roll over to their complete takeover.
[01:29:03.106 --> 01:29:05.368]  But please, search the term, everyone.
[01:29:05.368 --> 01:29:07.549]  Google launches.
[01:29:07.549 --> 01:29:09.791]  Google launches.
[01:29:09.791 --> 01:29:12.513]  And at first it was 20, 30 articles on Sunday about this.
[01:29:12.513 --> 01:29:14.374]  Then it was a hundred yesterday.
[01:29:14.374 --> 01:29:20.499]  It's hundreds of articles about the Obama deception, about their censorship, about everything.
[01:29:20.499 --> 01:29:23.481]  And we're really showing people what we can do when we take action.
[01:29:23.481 --> 01:29:24.122]  So everyone,
[01:29:24.502 --> 01:29:26.844]  And you watch, by the end of the show, it's gonna be the number one search.
[01:29:26.844 --> 01:29:29.585]  Google launches.
[01:29:29.585 --> 01:29:31.527]  Google launches.
[01:29:31.527 --> 01:29:34.248]  And they're gonna hate it when it's not Lindsay Lohan.
[01:29:34.248 --> 01:29:36.070]  They're gonna hate it when it's not Mel Gibson.
[01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:39.472]  They wanna keep you focused on stupid stuff like that, instead of...
[01:29:41.237 --> 01:29:50.971]  850-something thousand highest level security clearance private corporate globalist crooks with the highest level security clearances overthrowing America.
[01:29:50.971 --> 01:29:52.373]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.373 --> 01:29:54.897]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.897 --> 01:29:57.580]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:04.588 --> 01:30:05.869]  Tyranny is here.
[01:30:05.869 --> 01:30:09.533]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:30:09.533 --> 01:30:12.036]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:30:12.036 --> 01:30:17.101]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:30:17.882 --> 01:30:24.549]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:30:24.549 --> 01:30:30.516]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:30:30.516 --> 01:30:34.200]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:39.002]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:30:39.002 --> 01:30:44.945]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:30:44.945 --> 01:30:48.506]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:30:48.506 --> 01:30:50.467]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:30:50.467 --> 01:30:51.588]  It's here.

[01:33:22.110 --> 01:33:24.211]  We've got it.
[01:33:24.211 --> 01:33:28.473]  Are we seeing the earth now?
[01:33:28.473 --> 01:33:29.734]  We've got it.
[01:33:31.923 --> 01:33:37.628]  All right your phone calls are coming up and a bunch of other news we haven't even gotten to yet and we'll take you to the front lines in Arizona.
[01:33:37.628 --> 01:33:49.719]  We're going back to Steve Watson to finish up on the report that we're working on here with him but I mean is this the country you want to live in where we're just used to fund a global empire and private international
[01:33:50.339 --> 01:33:59.382]  Anti-American companies are censoring everything and spying on everything you do illegally and then censoring us when we try to expose that Google spies.
[01:33:59.382 --> 01:34:01.863]  That's why you got to search the term Google launches.
[01:34:01.863 --> 01:34:03.503]  We're going back to Steve here in just a moment.
[01:34:03.503 --> 01:34:07.064]  I want to tell you about a Cola Blue, the atmospheric water generator.
[01:34:07.064 --> 01:34:11.766]  It grabs humidity out of the air and the small unit produces seven and a half gallons a day.
[01:34:11.766 --> 01:34:14.307]  They've got bigger units that do thousands of gallons a day.
[01:34:14.307 --> 01:34:15.787]  The little unit's a great little unit.
[01:34:15.787 --> 01:34:17.608]  It looks like a water cooler without a water bottle.
[01:34:18.488 --> 01:34:22.150]  On top of it, the best, cleanest drinking water you're going to find anywhere.
[01:34:22.150 --> 01:34:23.951]  That is acolablue.com.
[01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:26.173]  E-C-O-L-O-B-L-U-E dot com.

[01:34:29.314 --> 01:34:32.817]  And they've also got three month payment options for folks on their units as well.
[01:34:32.817 --> 01:34:33.257]  acolablue.com.
[01:34:41.064 --> 01:34:43.686]  And lastly, I want to tell you about Inner Health Botanicals.
[01:34:43.686 --> 01:34:45.328]  We live in a toxic environment daily.
[01:34:45.328 --> 01:34:49.651]  We're bombarded with chemtrails, fluorides, pesticides, and other equally toxic chemicals.
[01:34:49.651 --> 01:34:54.315]  The folks on the Gulf Coast now worry about benzene, hydrocarbon, sulfide, methane,
[01:34:56.721 --> 01:35:03.704]  Glycol and the dispersant Corexit, just to name a few of the added dangers to their health.
[01:35:03.704 --> 01:35:08.406]  To stay ahead of the complicated games the New World Order plays, you need to stay healthy.
[01:35:08.406 --> 01:35:12.749]  And the products from Interfood Botanicals will help you be on top of your game for that fight.
[01:35:12.749 --> 01:35:16.110]  These guys have been around for six years and their products are awesome.
[01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:19.031]  My wife and I use them, so a lot of people here at the office.
[01:35:19.031 --> 01:35:22.273]  Interfood builds your body's defenses and helps you get rid of toxins.
[01:35:22.273 --> 01:35:24.154]  Try the Alex Jones Combo with the coconut.
[01:35:24.654 --> 01:35:24.814]  Yeah.
[01:35:51.957 --> 01:36:11.506]  I mean, I think this is really showing us, though, not only how much Google censors and tries to protect themselves and cover up the crimes they're committing, spying on everybody illegally, but it also shows how they are protected, and it also shows the power the people have to fight back when they stand up.
[01:36:11.506 --> 01:36:13.447]  Yeah, I mean, it is.
[01:36:13.447 --> 01:36:14.888]  This is the Infowar.
[01:36:14.888 --> 01:36:18.229]  This is the epicenter.
[01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:20.110]  I mean, if people
[01:36:21.587 --> 01:36:32.113]  You know, this, this episode has shown that if everyone takes action, everyone takes, you know, it's not even, it's not even that difficult to search these things.
[01:36:32.113 --> 01:36:36.755]  If everyone does that, it gets them to the top of these trend charts.
[01:36:36.755 --> 01:36:44.860]  Um, even if they try and censor them, even if they do censor them, we write stories about them censoring them.
[01:36:44.860 --> 01:36:50.243]  They have to censor the stories about us, about, you know, the censorship.
[01:36:50.243 --> 01:36:50.363]  So,
[01:36:51.658 --> 01:36:53.100]  This is the Infowar.
[01:36:53.100 --> 01:36:58.245]  People have got to, you know, take on this snowball effect and run with it.
[01:37:11.138 --> 01:37:12.819]  But they understand it's a war.
[01:37:12.819 --> 01:37:16.442]  They always keep pushing and pressing and never stopping.
[01:37:16.442 --> 01:37:18.104]  We have to be the same way.
[01:37:18.104 --> 01:37:19.365]  This is like a boxing match.
[01:37:19.365 --> 01:37:21.766]  You don't punch them one time and they fall over.
[01:37:21.766 --> 01:37:27.571]  This has got to be an ongoing rolling with the punches and whoever wants it most.
[01:37:27.571 --> 01:37:28.051]  It has, yeah.
[01:37:28.051 --> 01:37:32.235]  And I mean, you know, we've documented how.
[01:37:32.235 --> 01:37:36.958]  We wrote an article recently called The Lights Are Going Out For The Internet.
[01:37:36.958 --> 01:37:37.539]  And that's got
[01:37:38.948 --> 01:37:44.872]  You know, several links to several articles we've written about all the different ways that the internet is being attacked.
[01:37:44.872 --> 01:37:51.397]  And if, you know, let's face it, if we lose the internet, half of the battle is lost.
[01:37:51.397 --> 01:37:57.221]  Because it is, it is, you know, the modern day equivalent of the printing press.
[01:37:57.221 --> 01:38:01.004]  It is freedom.
[01:38:01.004 --> 01:38:02.145]  Electronic freedom.
[01:38:02.145 --> 01:38:02.605]  You know, there's
[01:38:03.599 --> 01:38:08.001]  No other way that we can reach as many people as we can if we lose this.
[01:38:08.001 --> 01:38:15.945]  So we've got to, we've got to focus on, you know, fighting this long war.
[01:38:15.945 --> 01:38:18.886]  Fighting these battles, winning these battles.
[01:38:18.886 --> 01:38:21.207]  But, you know, the job's not done.
[01:38:21.207 --> 01:38:22.088]  The job's never done.
[01:38:22.088 --> 01:38:26.570]  We can have small victories, but they're going to come back and they're going to throw more at us.
[01:38:26.570 --> 01:38:28.771]  So we've just got to focus down and
[01:38:30.498 --> 01:38:31.019]  Keep going.
[01:38:31.019 --> 01:38:31.900]  Well, that's it, Steve.
[01:38:31.900 --> 01:38:34.122]  Resistance is victory.
[01:38:34.122 --> 01:38:35.324]  And history has shown that.
[01:38:35.324 --> 01:38:37.566]  And the globalists built the Internet.
[01:38:37.566 --> 01:38:41.631]  The NSA joked more than 20 years ago they called it World Wide Wiretap.
[01:38:41.631 --> 01:38:42.673]  That was their joke.
[01:38:42.673 --> 01:38:46.777]  What WWW stood for was World Wide Wiretap.
[01:38:47.618 --> 01:38:57.881]  And even though it's their grid and their system, alternative media has now, what a year ago in the statistics, supplanted and is bigger than mainstream media.
[01:38:57.881 --> 01:39:00.062]  And it's only swinging more in our direction.
[01:39:00.062 --> 01:39:10.925]  So the system, the mainstream media, government corporations, the top corporations are teaming up to not just destroy the web, but to destroy the free web and create a plastic corporate
[01:39:11.485 --> 01:39:11.865]  That's
[01:39:26.442 --> 01:39:29.284]  They get us addicted to the web, then they kill the old web.
[01:39:29.284 --> 01:39:33.346]  It's kind of like the big bankers come in and put toll roads on existing roads.
[01:39:33.346 --> 01:39:40.291]  They're just coming in and taking over our internet right now, and it's so outrageous, if we stand up and speak out against it, they're not going to get away with it.
[01:39:40.291 --> 01:39:44.714]  I mean, Australia's starting to back off net censorship, they said, for at least a year.
[01:39:44.714 --> 01:39:50.958]  Italy's starting to back off a bit, because the public isn't going along with it, and none of us need to go along with this.
[01:39:50.958 --> 01:39:54.100]  We need to say no, no, no, and point out what's happening here.
[01:39:55.953 --> 01:40:20.342]  Yeah, and it is, you know, like you said, the internet was, it was, it was started, it was invented by the Pentagon, by the military, and they now refer to it as the illegitimate child, the one that got away, because the people have taken over the internet, and now they refer to it, you know, in terms of fighting it, as if it's, you know,
[01:40:22.113 --> 01:40:26.297]  Well, they talk about anti-war people, pro-Second Amendment people, anti-Federal Reserve.
[01:40:26.297 --> 01:40:28.238]  We're the enemy!
[01:40:38.203 --> 01:40:41.225]  They're not fighting, quote, terrorists on the web, they're fighting us.
[01:40:41.225 --> 01:40:55.238]  And Steve, do you agree with me that we're getting very ripe with their preconditioning for staged false flag attacks on the web that these private corporations and government will launch themselves as a pretext to shut down the free web as we know it?
[01:40:55.238 --> 01:41:01.824]  Well, that's the only way that they can keep going with this, keep pushing this censorship thing, is to have that pretext to do it.
[01:41:03.121 --> 01:41:05.082]  Really, it's a two-pronged attack.
[01:41:05.082 --> 01:41:16.489]  There's that, the cyber terror attack, and there's also the, um, you know, the copyright issues, which they, which they're using to do essentially the same thing.
[01:41:16.489 --> 01:41:24.773]  You know, all the bills, we've got a bill here called the Digital Economy Act, where they, uh, well, it's already passed.
[01:41:24.773 --> 01:41:26.975]  The government's talking about repealing it, the new government here.
[01:41:26.975 --> 01:41:31.117]  It's already passed, but it's based upon if you or anybody
[01:41:31.818 --> 01:41:50.514]  In your family that uses your internet connection, downloads some music or something, or a film or whatever, uh, that's copyrighted, it's the sort of three strikes and out thing, and you've got that, you know, currently, um, with the Lieberman thing, the kill switch bill.
[01:41:50.514 --> 01:41:59.001]  So it's the two pronged attack, they've got the cyber terrorism thing, and the copyright thing, so, they're gonna keep pushing both of those,
[01:42:04.915 --> 01:42:23.630]  The good news is the Pentagon first designed the internet to be able to take a nuclear strike so you can't shut it off and that's why they're just trying to take it over instead of shutting it off because it's designed like a brain to just keep growing new neurons when they try to shut it off and now that people have such a hunger for alternative information
[01:42:24.731 --> 01:42:31.840]  I think the globalists have already lost the battle, and they are going to fail if we simply take action and stand up against them.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:39.308]  And I know you're about to go out to a meeting here in a moment, Steve, but I'm going to call you during the next break because I have another huge idea.
[01:42:39.949 --> 01:42:44.771]  For a story tomorrow that we can make the number one search that is going to devastate these people.
[01:42:44.771 --> 01:42:51.674]  I mean, the light bulb just went on a few minutes ago above my head and we've demonstrated that our ideas are quite effective here.
[01:42:51.674 --> 01:42:54.635]  We also use a lot of our great listeners' ideas when they call in with them.
[01:42:54.635 --> 01:42:59.957]  It was a caller Friday who said, I'm sick of Lindsay Lohan and Mel Gibson being about the BP oil spill.
[01:42:59.957 --> 01:43:02.358]  And I said, well, let's just make the Obama deception the number one search.
[01:43:02.358 --> 01:43:05.299]  It's already the number one video when you type in the name Obama.
[01:43:05.299 --> 01:43:05.999]  And we did that.
[01:43:05.999 --> 01:43:07.079]  We showed people the power.
[01:43:07.079 --> 01:43:07.920]  But I've got an idea.
[01:43:08.860 --> 01:43:09.981]  No problem at all, Alex.
[01:43:09.981 --> 01:43:10.421]  It's a pleasure.
[01:43:10.421 --> 01:43:10.481]  Yes.
[01:43:35.615 --> 01:43:39.999]  Steve Watson does the best Emperor Palpatine imitation I've ever seen.
[01:43:39.999 --> 01:43:51.908]  And for some light humor here, we've got to have that occasionally, will you please give us an Emperor Palpatine imitation?
[01:43:51.908 --> 01:44:00.415]  Everything is proceeding exactly as I have foreseen.
[01:44:00.415 --> 01:44:02.197]  Judah, you've done well, Lord Vader One.
[01:44:10.684 --> 01:44:17.488]  We hope the cartoon industry doesn't hire you away to do bad guy voices.
[01:44:17.488 --> 01:44:20.410]  I'm looking forward to completing your training.
[01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:24.172]  In time, you will call me master.
[01:44:24.172 --> 01:44:27.714]  Say, in time, Google will control the entire web.
[01:44:27.714 --> 01:44:33.077]  In time, Google will control the entire web.
[01:44:35.188 --> 01:44:36.169]  Man, this is good.
[01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:40.152]  But you know, they said two years ago that Google wants to be the Internet.
[01:44:40.152 --> 01:44:41.433]  In fact, I searched that term.
[01:44:41.433 --> 01:44:43.354]  Google to become the Internet.
[01:44:43.354 --> 01:44:44.996]  I mean, that's really something they're pushing.
[01:44:44.996 --> 01:44:47.678]  And then we know Google is NSA.
[01:44:47.678 --> 01:44:48.498]  This is amazing.
[01:44:48.498 --> 01:44:53.122]  In fact, as Emperor Google, talk about your surveillance of the little slaves.
[01:44:53.122 --> 01:45:00.287]  Or the head of Facebook calling his users dumb effers because they trust him.
[01:45:00.287 --> 01:45:03.790]  Well, the head of Facebook, he is my servant.
[01:45:03.790 --> 01:45:04.911]  I have instructed him.
[01:45:05.583 --> 01:45:06.384]  Directly.
[01:45:06.384 --> 01:45:11.827]  To refer to the users as silly little effers.
[01:45:11.827 --> 01:45:17.030]  They will all in time call me master.
[01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:19.192]  All right, hey Steve, you're awesome.
[01:45:19.192 --> 01:45:20.833]  Do your Lord Moncton imitation.
[01:45:20.833 --> 01:45:22.734]  Come on now, baby, I'm waiting.
[01:45:22.734 --> 01:45:24.475]  This is what goes on behind the scenes, folks.
[01:45:24.475 --> 01:45:26.657]  Go ahead.
[01:45:26.657 --> 01:45:27.397]  Moncton, okay.
[01:45:27.397 --> 01:45:29.518]  We're going to get into Gary for the Moncton.
[01:45:32.970 --> 01:45:34.231]  We've had the debates.
[01:45:34.231 --> 01:45:35.672]  The time has arrived.
[01:45:35.672 --> 01:45:38.533]  I've tried to get in touch with Al Gore.
[01:45:38.533 --> 01:45:40.414]  I've said, come on out, baby.
[01:45:40.414 --> 01:45:41.115]  I'm waiting.
[01:45:41.115 --> 01:45:44.317]  But he won't have any of it.
[01:45:44.317 --> 01:45:47.959]  You know, Steve, you've actually got a degree in politics, don't you?
[01:45:47.959 --> 01:45:49.179]  What's your degree?
[01:45:49.179 --> 01:45:52.321]  I've got a master's degree in international relations.
[01:45:52.321 --> 01:45:53.322]  That's right.
[01:45:53.322 --> 01:45:55.183]  And a degree in impression.
[01:45:55.891 --> 01:45:56.331]  Exactly.
[01:45:56.331 --> 01:46:00.952]  I hired your brother, and then I found out how intelligent you are about the New World Order and hired you.
[01:46:00.952 --> 01:46:03.713]  I mean, I've had your brother working with me for, what, nine years?
[01:46:03.713 --> 01:46:07.134]  And you for, is it seven or eight?
[01:46:07.134 --> 01:46:08.314]  Yeah, he's nine.
[01:46:08.314 --> 01:46:09.894]  He's nine years.
[01:46:09.894 --> 01:46:17.296]  I've always been there, but, you know, the operation expanded, you know, about 2004, 2005.
[01:46:17.296 --> 01:46:23.598]  That's when I came in, you know, properly full-time, working on InfoWars.net.
[01:46:24.838 --> 01:46:38.971]  Well you know Weldon Henson's worked for us for about five years in the shipping department and now his band is getting so popular he's flying to Paris and Nashville and packing the top places here in Austin.
[01:46:38.971 --> 01:46:40.852]  Weldon might be leaving us soon because his
[01:46:41.593 --> 01:46:44.794]  His country band's gotten so successful, and he is a talented guy.
[01:46:44.794 --> 01:46:49.496]  You've actually got a rock band, and I hope it doesn't get too popular so we lose you, Steve.
[01:46:49.496 --> 01:46:54.278]  But Steve, even if your band gets picked up big time and it's starting to get a lot of traction, you're not going to leave us, are you?
[01:46:54.278 --> 01:46:55.458]  You're not going to leave the Infowar?
[01:46:55.458 --> 01:46:58.499]  No, I'm not going to leave the Infowar.
[01:46:58.499 --> 01:47:01.561]  Give folks a plug for your band and your MySpace website.
[01:47:01.561 --> 01:47:07.683]  The band is called Ice Station Zebra, which is named after a book.
[01:47:08.801 --> 01:47:10.522]  Ice Station Zebra.
[01:47:32.912 --> 01:47:33.692]  All right, buddy.
[01:47:33.692 --> 01:47:34.873]  Hey, good having you on with us.
[01:47:34.873 --> 01:47:36.013]  I appreciate you spending time.
[01:47:36.013 --> 01:47:39.215]  And the search term for tomorrow, I'm going to, well, just stay on hold.
[01:47:39.215 --> 01:47:40.996]  I'll talk to you during the break.
[01:47:40.996 --> 01:47:44.117]  And thank you, Steve Watson, because I got a big idea for tomorrow.
[01:47:44.117 --> 01:47:46.638]  But the idea today is Google launches.
[01:47:46.638 --> 01:47:47.699]  You search that term.
[01:47:48.599 --> 01:47:55.622]  Send it to the top, Google Launches, then hundreds of other newspapers, magazines, web blogs will then see it's the top search.
[01:47:55.622 --> 01:48:06.028]  They'll then try to find out what's happening and write a story about Steve Watson's article, Top Secret America, Google Launches, cover-up of Google Spies story.
[01:48:06.028 --> 01:48:08.109]  See, because they've blocked out the word Google Spies.
[01:48:08.109 --> 01:48:10.150]  It was number one yesterday, they removed it totally.
[01:48:10.150 --> 01:48:12.771]  It went back up today, removed it totally.
[01:48:12.771 --> 01:48:16.393]  So now when you search Google Launches, it will lead you to Google Spies.
[01:48:17.389 --> 01:48:23.495]  We can play this hopscotch game with them forever, even though they're in there trying to block us.
[01:48:23.495 --> 01:48:24.936]  I was having some fun with Steve there.
[01:48:24.936 --> 01:48:31.782]  We're going to come back in the next segment, the segment after that, and we're going to talk to Alex, Matt, Rosa, Maria, Mojo.
[01:48:32.683 --> 01:48:50.227]  And then eight minutes after, into the hour after that, we're going to be having, coming up in about 15 minutes, we're going to have Glenn Spencer on, who's probably the leading researcher that I know on what's happening to our borders, the North American Union, our country being sacrificed on the altar of globalism.
[01:48:50.227 --> 01:48:51.227]  That is all coming up.
[01:48:51.227 --> 01:48:56.688]  I briefly wanted to remind listeners, part two of the Obama deception is the fall of the republic.
[01:48:57.088 --> 01:48:59.910]  Follow the Republic, the presidency of Barack H. Obama.
[01:48:59.910 --> 01:49:06.636]  You can get the DVD at InfoWars.com if you want it in the highest quality with the extras in to support us, or to give it as a gift to somebody, the gift of waking them up.
[01:49:06.636 --> 01:49:09.879]  People tend to watch it when it's the high quality, you know, DVD cover and things.
[01:49:09.879 --> 01:49:11.720]  Or you're welcome to burn copies of it and give it to people.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.541]  In fact, I want you to.
[01:49:12.541 --> 01:49:13.602]  I'm begging you to.
[01:49:13.602 --> 01:49:15.824]  Air it on AXS television.
[01:49:15.824 --> 01:49:16.884]  But expanding on that,
[01:49:17.785 --> 01:49:19.346]  It is part two of the Obama Deception.
[01:49:19.346 --> 01:49:20.286]  It's free online.
[01:49:20.286 --> 01:49:21.286]  It's on, change the channel.
[01:49:21.286 --> 01:49:23.707]  It's got about two million views there.
[01:49:23.707 --> 01:49:25.788]  Couple more million views on YouTube.
[01:49:25.788 --> 01:49:26.808]  Millions and millions of others.
[01:49:26.808 --> 01:49:28.608]  It's probably got about 10 million views total online.
[01:49:28.608 --> 01:49:32.290]  Obama Deception 25 plus mil with the different versions.
[01:49:32.290 --> 01:49:34.070]  So send this link out to everybody too.
[01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:35.691]  Fall of the Republic.
[01:49:35.691 --> 01:49:43.773]  But they're really scared of this because when you type Obama in, it was the number one link, Obama Deception, into Google, into Yahoo.
[01:49:43.773 --> 01:49:46.034]  Now it's not like that since they took the video down.
[01:49:47.134 --> 01:49:51.338]  But let's see if that's changed now since yesterday.
[01:49:51.338 --> 01:49:55.121]  It had gone from not being in the top 10 to being number 5 once they reinstated it.
[01:49:55.121 --> 01:49:57.643]  Let's see if when you type in Obama, it's risen to the top again.
[01:49:57.643 --> 01:50:00.725]  Obama!
[01:50:00.725 --> 01:50:02.607]  Obama!
[01:50:02.607 --> 01:50:03.588]  Obama!
[01:50:03.588 --> 01:50:05.389]  Obama!
[01:50:05.389 --> 01:50:06.430]  See, I can do imitations too.
[01:50:06.430 --> 01:50:07.291]  That's an Obama supporter.
[01:50:09.889 --> 01:50:20.197]  And Obama, you know, and his cohorts are like two giant wolves between some bug-eyed sheep, and the sheep's like caressing up to the leg of the wolf who has saliva dripping.
[01:50:20.197 --> 01:50:24.520]  He's licking his chops, he's about to eat them, and they're just cozying up like, Obama!
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:26.242]  Obama!
[01:50:26.242 --> 01:50:28.563]  All right, I'm out of control, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:28.563 --> 01:50:30.825]  Just trying to have some fun here.
[01:50:30.825 --> 01:50:33.807]  It's so hard to be serious all the time.
[01:50:33.807 --> 01:50:36.770]  Let's type Obama in and see what happens.
[01:50:38.565 --> 01:50:41.488]  And no sir, it's like link number five still.
[01:50:41.488 --> 01:50:43.671]  So they had some victory there.
[01:50:43.671 --> 01:50:45.813]  You type Obama in, it's the fifth link.
[01:50:45.813 --> 01:50:47.255]  My film, not number one.
[01:50:47.255 --> 01:50:49.778]  So I guess they got what they wanted to a certain extent.
[01:50:49.778 --> 01:50:53.682]  You've got to go in online, click on that link to the video to drive it to the top.
[01:50:53.682 --> 01:50:55.243]  We'll see how they like that.
[01:50:55.243 --> 01:50:57.666]  We'll be right back with your phone calls straight ahead.
[01:50:57.666 --> 01:50:58.167]  Stay with us.
[01:51:01.744 --> 01:51:05.487]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[01:51:05.487 --> 01:51:06.808]  Think again!
[01:51:06.808 --> 01:51:14.474]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[01:51:14.474 --> 01:51:21.700]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:27.104]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers.
[01:51:27.264 --> 01:51:27.705]  We're good to go.
[01:51:42.261 --> 01:51:42.761]  We're good to go!
[01:52:01.072 --> 01:52:02.373]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.373 --> 01:52:07.955]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.955 --> 01:52:12.977]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.977 --> 01:52:18.019]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.559 --> 01:52:23.783]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.783 --> 01:52:26.084]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[01:52:26.084 --> 01:52:30.887]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.887 --> 01:52:32.008]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.008 --> 01:52:35.090]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:35.090 --> 01:52:38.713]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.713 --> 01:52:41.895]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:41.895 --> 01:52:44.116]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:52:44.116 --> 01:52:45.037]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:48.679 --> 01:52:51.645]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:51.645 --> 01:52:57.758]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.758 --> 01:52:59.842]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.107 --> 01:53:04.648]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[01:53:04.648 --> 01:53:06.948]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[01:53:06.948 --> 01:53:07.808]  Don't!
[01:53:07.808 --> 01:53:11.249]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[01:53:11.249 --> 01:53:18.371]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb K.'
[01:53:18.351 --> 01:53:20.331]  's number one debt secret.
[01:53:20.331 --> 01:53:23.992]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[01:53:24.412 --> 01:53:27.536]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[01:53:27.536 --> 01:53:34.924]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[01:53:34.924 --> 01:53:36.105]  Herb K was right.
[01:53:36.105 --> 01:53:39.149]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[01:53:39.309 --> 01:53:40.570]  What do you have to lose?
[01:53:40.570 --> 01:53:41.770]  Stop the calls now.
[01:53:41.770 --> 01:53:43.731]  Get out of debt and have more money.
[01:53:43.731 --> 01:53:47.053]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[01:53:47.053 --> 01:53:47.393]  Call 800-405-7850.
[01:53:47.393 --> 01:53:47.993]  That's 800-405-7850.
[01:53:47.993 --> 01:53:48.033]  800-405-7850.
[01:54:17.848 --> 01:54:23.954]  I started my plugging for the films earlier and didn't point out you can get four copies of the Obama Deception for $19.95.
[01:54:23.954 --> 01:54:27.979]  High quality DVD and the highest quality with the extras.
[01:54:28.925 --> 01:54:33.488]  You can get 10 copies for $39.95, so that's right at $4 a piece.
[01:54:33.488 --> 01:54:35.130]  Or what's that come out to?
[01:54:35.130 --> 01:54:37.391]  Yeah, right at $4 a piece.
[01:54:37.391 --> 01:54:43.676]  All available at InfoWars.com, the secure online shopping cart where you can call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:54:43.676 --> 01:54:47.378]  Air it on AXS TV, have local showings.
[01:54:47.378 --> 01:54:55.564]  You know, there was a fella who rents time on one of the biggest LA TV stations a few months ago, and he
[01:54:56.713 --> 01:55:05.998]  Has like one hour every Saturday, and he aired one hour of it, and then the next week they gave him his money back and said, you can't air the second half of that.
[01:55:05.998 --> 01:55:07.258]  We had pressure put on us.
[01:55:07.258 --> 01:55:13.121]  They do not want you to see the Obama deception and fall of the Republic or Invisible Empire.
[01:55:13.121 --> 01:55:15.362]  They deleted Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA.
[01:55:15.362 --> 01:55:17.143]  They're all available at Infowars.com.
[01:55:17.143 --> 01:55:19.264]  Okay, I'm done talking about that.
[01:55:19.264 --> 01:55:21.645]  You know they want it shut down, so get it out to everybody.
[01:55:21.645 --> 01:55:23.526]  Let's talk to Alex in Connecticut.
[01:55:23.526 --> 01:55:24.347]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:55:25.811 --> 01:55:27.493]  Hey Alex, how are you?
[01:55:27.493 --> 01:55:31.136]  First of all, my family and I want to thank you for your hard work.
[01:55:31.136 --> 01:55:34.639]  I just have a couple points I would like to make.
[01:55:34.639 --> 01:55:44.809]  We live in a small town in the northwest corner of Connecticut, and my sister that's 16 and I go to our nearest towns to post stickers, articles, and posters up.
[01:55:44.809 --> 01:55:47.712]  And every time we go back to put new information on,
[01:55:48.763 --> 01:55:57.298]  Everyone takes our stuff down and it's incredible how people are so disrespectful, ignorant, and brainwashed.
[01:55:57.298 --> 01:55:58.940]  But Alex, we're not going to stop.
[01:55:58.940 --> 01:56:02.186]  We keep going every week to put new information up.
[01:56:02.970 --> 01:56:13.654]  Also, I just want to point out that we've also researched bottled waters like Poland Spring, Fiji, Pellegrino, and they all contain fluoride.
[01:56:13.654 --> 01:56:19.817]  For example, if you go to Fiji's website, they state that fluoride would increase bone density.
[01:56:19.817 --> 01:56:26.520]  And now, our family and I are buying PentaWater that we buy from our local health food store.
[01:56:27.441 --> 01:56:29.502]  Also, I have a question for you.
[01:56:29.502 --> 01:56:33.645]  My fiancé and I have a daughter and she's 15 months old.
[01:56:33.645 --> 01:56:42.710]  And the last time we were at the doctor, she had told us that we had to bring Gabby to get her blood drawn out because of the lead.
[01:56:42.710 --> 01:56:44.991]  Now, do you know anything about that?
[01:56:44.991 --> 01:56:45.872]  I'm a young mom.
[01:56:45.872 --> 01:56:47.433]  No, no, yeah, yeah, no, I mean, I mean...
[01:56:47.873 --> 01:56:57.477]  They tell the doctors who just follow orders, and most of them are compartmentalized and aren't really that smart, that, oh, you know, we take the baby's blood at birth to test for diseases.
[01:56:57.477 --> 01:56:58.898]  Well, why doesn't the hospital just do it?
[01:56:58.898 --> 01:57:03.060]  No, it's sent to the government and kept in a database that's now admitted, has nothing to do with a blood test.
[01:57:04.181 --> 01:57:06.263]  And yes, there is a lot of levels of lead.
[01:57:06.263 --> 01:57:09.046]  The government knows it's in the soft drinks, the foods.
[01:57:09.046 --> 01:57:10.327]  It's put there by design.
[01:57:10.327 --> 01:57:11.889]  That's on record.
[01:57:11.889 --> 01:57:15.974]  And then their answer is, oh, we got to test everybody for their blood.
[01:57:15.974 --> 01:57:18.256]  And they just mandate this stuff.
[01:57:18.256 --> 01:57:19.157]  But chances are,
[01:57:20.138 --> 01:57:24.742]  Uh, they're gonna try to test it for marijuana or something and try to, you know, take your child.
[01:57:24.742 --> 01:57:26.163]  They do all sorts of stuff.
[01:57:26.163 --> 01:57:33.408]  Doctors are now indentured servants of the health department, itself a eugenics office of racial hygiene.
[01:57:33.408 --> 01:57:36.471]  The health department was set up for racial hygiene, to exterminate people.
[01:57:36.471 --> 01:57:39.993]  That's just a historical fact and the average health department person doesn't even know.
[01:57:39.993 --> 01:57:42.736]  They're just compartmentalized to do all of this.
[01:57:43.676 --> 01:57:49.380]  Uh, and so they may be, you know, uh, you know, recommending that test because the doctor really cares.
[01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:54.303]  She may not even know that it's being sent off to the health department or it may not even be being sent off.
[01:57:54.303 --> 01:57:56.044]  And we know all the blood they take at birth is.
[01:57:56.044 --> 01:58:02.089]  Uh, so that's a complex issue, but you can find the doctor you choose of your choice.
[01:58:02.089 --> 01:58:08.393]  Uh, and you know, my rule is I don't take my children to the doctor unless they're really sick and none of my children never had a shot.
[01:58:08.393 --> 01:58:12.956]  And does that mean there might be some, you know, a pathogenic thing they can get?
[01:58:14.296 --> 01:58:17.398]  Yes, but I've weighed the dangers.
[01:58:17.398 --> 01:58:19.939]  I know what they're putting in the vaccines.
[01:58:19.939 --> 01:58:21.399]  I knew the flu shot was a fraud.
[01:58:21.399 --> 01:58:23.160]  It came out it was.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.541]  So you just can't trust these people to do anything.
[01:58:25.541 --> 01:58:27.262]  Better eat organic.
[01:58:27.262 --> 01:58:31.383]  Better keep your child away from all this adulterated government stuff.
[01:58:31.383 --> 01:58:33.084]  And they will thank you for it.
[01:58:33.084 --> 01:58:34.004]  I appreciate your call.
[01:58:34.004 --> 01:58:34.504]  God bless you.
[01:58:34.504 --> 01:58:37.526]  We'll be back in 70 seconds with a third hour straight to your phone calls.
[01:58:37.526 --> 01:58:37.906]  Then a guest.
[01:58:37.906 --> 01:58:38.326]  Stay with us.
[01:58:42.756 --> 01:58:45.382]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.382 --> 01:58:48.550]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today!
[01:58:50.455 --> 01:58:55.018]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.018 --> 01:58:55.918]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.918 --> 01:58:59.341]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.341 --> 01:59:00.221]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.221 --> 01:59:05.104]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.104 --> 01:59:05.845]  It's true.
[01:59:05.845 --> 01:59:10.728]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.728 --> 01:59:11.548]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.548 --> 01:59:15.131]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.131 --> 01:59:18.833]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.033 --> 01:59:19.834]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.834 --> 01:59:22.596]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.596 --> 01:59:26.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.280 --> 01:59:27.061]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.061 --> 01:59:31.224]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.224 --> 01:59:35.969]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.249 --> 01:59:40.433]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.433 --> 01:59:42.214]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.214 --> 01:59:44.476]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.476 --> 01:59:47.078]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.078 --> 01:59:48.460]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.460 --> 01:59:54.445]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.580 --> 02:00:10.422]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.422 --> 02:00:12.003]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.003 --> 02:00:13.563]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.563 --> 02:00:17.745]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.745 --> 02:00:23.447]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.447 --> 02:00:29.870]  Glenn Spencer of American Patrol joins us from Arizona to give us the latest on the charioting situation there in the next segment.
[02:00:31.175 --> 02:00:33.356]  I'll also get into this Daily Finance story.
[02:00:33.356 --> 02:00:38.658]  California's latest revolt against smart electric meters.
[02:00:38.658 --> 02:00:40.358]  And they were supposed to ask you if you wanted one.
[02:00:40.358 --> 02:00:40.859]  They don't ask.
[02:00:40.859 --> 02:00:42.399]  They just come and put them on.
[02:00:42.399 --> 02:00:43.580]  Austin's been getting them.
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:44.920]  They don't ask us here.
[02:00:44.920 --> 02:00:50.362]  And now they admit they're going to remote control your thermostat and control what's going on in your house.
[02:00:50.362 --> 02:00:53.843]  They're telling Fed workers to be urged to commute, travel less.
[02:00:53.843 --> 02:00:57.865]  Then that's going to be forced on citizens that you're not allowed to travel or you'll be taxed when you do.
[02:00:59.517 --> 02:01:05.760]  This is total taxation and an excuse to surveil everything you do because they got to know when you're traveling.
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:08.501]  That's all part of this smart grid that IBM's promoting.
[02:01:08.501 --> 02:01:09.762]  It's called a smart prison.
[02:01:10.680 --> 02:01:15.283]  Remember IBM brought you the barcodes on the Jews' arms in the death camps?
[02:01:15.283 --> 02:01:16.784]  Well, you'll be getting yours soon enough.
[02:01:16.784 --> 02:01:19.085]  It's called your face scan, your thumbprint.
[02:01:19.085 --> 02:01:20.747]  All run by these eugenicists.
[02:01:20.747 --> 02:01:23.228]  IBM's sole goal is eugenics.
[02:01:23.228 --> 02:01:26.770]  It is a eugenics trust by Mr. Watson.
[02:01:26.770 --> 02:01:29.953]  Okay, let's go ahead and take a few phone calls here.
[02:01:29.953 --> 02:01:31.534]  Let's talk to Matt in Connecticut.
[02:01:31.534 --> 02:01:32.314]  Matt, you're on the air.
[02:01:32.314 --> 02:01:34.195]  Hey Alex.
[02:01:34.195 --> 02:01:35.036]  Hey sir, how you doing?
[02:01:36.013 --> 02:01:36.753]  I'm good.
[02:01:36.753 --> 02:01:39.015]  I have an idea to wake people up.
[02:01:39.015 --> 02:01:48.099]  But first, I wanted to say that I think a lot of people would be interested in hearing the broadcast you did on September 11, 2001.
[02:01:48.099 --> 02:01:52.982]  If you could make that available.
[02:01:52.982 --> 02:01:53.722]  It is available.
[02:01:53.722 --> 02:01:57.084]  You can just search the term Alex Jones on 9-11.
[02:01:57.084 --> 02:01:59.085]  It's all over the web.
[02:01:59.085 --> 02:01:59.885]  Oh, alright.
[02:01:59.885 --> 02:02:05.548]  And also, with Obama's approval dropping about a point a week and
[02:02:06.357 --> 02:02:08.602]  All these officials saying how they need a new 9-11.
[02:02:10.839 --> 02:02:17.722]  I don't see any way how they won't try and stage another terror attack and blame it on anti-government extremists.
[02:02:36.724 --> 02:02:48.032]  Yeah, so I think to plant the seeds ahead of time, to call it ahead of time so when it actually happens, people will be more suspective of the government.
[02:02:48.032 --> 02:02:56.318]  On top of Google launches, people need to search Obama needs new 9-11 and have it linked to that article from a few days ago.
[02:02:56.318 --> 02:02:59.580]  Oh, funny, funny you'd say something like that.
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:02.282]  All in due time, my friend, all in due time.
[02:03:02.282 --> 02:03:05.704]  You have done well, Matt.
[02:03:05.704 --> 02:03:06.185]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:03:07.065 --> 02:03:08.766]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[02:03:08.766 --> 02:03:11.868]  Believe me, we're on the same page there, Bubba.
[02:03:11.868 --> 02:03:14.890]  But these things must be done delicately.
[02:03:14.890 --> 02:03:16.592]  Now that I'm doing evil person imitations.
[02:03:16.592 --> 02:03:19.253]  We've done the Emperor, now the Wicked Witch.
[02:03:19.253 --> 02:03:20.634]  I'm melting!
[02:03:20.634 --> 02:03:24.717]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rosa Maria in New York.
[02:03:24.717 --> 02:03:25.237]  You're on the air.
[02:03:25.237 --> 02:03:25.818]  Thanks for holding.
[02:03:27.056 --> 02:03:31.598]  Yeah, thank you Alex for everything you do, of course, in spreading awareness to our entire globe.
[02:03:31.598 --> 02:03:41.403]  I have a few things I'd like to talk about, and one in particular that happened to me personally, in regards to everything that's going on in our police state, and I've watched all your videos.
[02:03:41.403 --> 02:03:50.867]  Personally, on the 4th of July, on Independence Day, I was traveling alone with my dog, who is a licensed service animal.
[02:03:53.319 --> 02:03:56.580]  He was a miniature pincher of almost eight years old.
[02:03:56.580 --> 02:04:09.943]  I was coming back from a camping trip, our first camping trip in Sedona, Arizona, coming back to Manhattan, and I was pulled over by the DPS, the Department of Public Safety.
[02:04:09.943 --> 02:04:11.863]  They did not tell me why they were pulling me over.
[02:04:11.863 --> 02:04:16.384]  Now I'm about five feet tall, 110 pounds, absolutely no threat at all.
[02:04:17.361 --> 02:04:24.645]  They pulled me over and they, he took, told me to get out of the car, shouted at me through the loudspeaker.
[02:04:24.645 --> 02:04:27.386]  Very, um, it's very angry.
[02:04:27.386 --> 02:04:29.367]  And so what happened?
[02:04:29.367 --> 02:04:30.307]  Got me out of the car.
[02:04:30.307 --> 02:04:36.450]  I saw my dog, Duncan, named after Dunkin Donuts, sitting in the backseat, quietly resting.
[02:04:36.450 --> 02:04:38.591]  Told me to get out of the car, to not turn around.
[02:04:38.591 --> 02:04:40.332]  And I heard a shotgun click.
[02:04:40.332 --> 02:04:41.933]  He cocked it from his vehicle.
[02:04:42.785 --> 02:04:45.866]  Told me to walk backwards, kneel down behind the vehicle.
[02:04:45.866 --> 02:04:47.626]  Immediately put me under arrest.
[02:04:47.626 --> 02:04:49.607]  Never read any Mirandarite.
[02:04:49.607 --> 02:04:51.967]  I was put in the back of a cop car.
[02:04:51.967 --> 02:04:54.428]  I have multiple sclerosis.
[02:04:54.428 --> 02:04:59.009]  I told him specifically he was violating... Stay there, finish your story.
[02:04:59.009 --> 02:05:00.909]  We've got Glenn Spencer coming up from Arizona.
[02:05:00.909 --> 02:05:04.910]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:04.910 --> 02:05:10.892]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:11.292 --> 02:05:18.675]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:05:18.675 --> 02:05:23.557]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[02:05:32.221 --> 02:05:35.963]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:05:36.483 --> 02:05:43.246]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:05:43.246 --> 02:05:47.128]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:05:47.128 --> 02:05:53.230]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1-2 month soap sampler.

[02:08:10.512 --> 02:08:15.135]  This is our land.
[02:08:15.135 --> 02:08:18.458]  These are our people.
[02:08:18.458 --> 02:08:19.218]  The workers.
[02:08:19.218 --> 02:08:22.320]  The strivers.
[02:08:22.320 --> 02:08:25.002]  The builders.
[02:08:25.002 --> 02:08:28.465]  These are our people.
[02:08:28.465 --> 02:08:31.807]  Who are they?
[02:08:31.807 --> 02:08:33.709]  They are the dark armies.
[02:08:35.414 --> 02:08:38.636]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:08:38.636 --> 02:08:51.622]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:08:51.622 --> 02:08:59.906]  Alright my friends, we are back live.
[02:08:59.906 --> 02:09:03.408]  Glenn Spencer coming up here from the front lines of what's happening in Arizona.
[02:09:05.057 --> 02:09:07.838]  A lady, Rosa Maria, called in from New York.
[02:09:07.838 --> 02:09:12.659]  For those that just joined us, she was describing that she traveled from New York to go camping.
[02:09:12.659 --> 02:09:13.639]  She was driving back.
[02:09:13.639 --> 02:09:16.320]  She has multiple sclerosis, I believe she said.
[02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:18.901]  She has a service dog that's a miniature pincher.
[02:09:18.901 --> 02:09:20.581]  Those are pretty sweet dogs.
[02:09:20.581 --> 02:09:26.423]  A police officer pulled her over, bullhorned her out, said, get on your knees, finish up your story of what happened, Rosa Maria.
[02:09:27.068 --> 02:09:38.295]  At that point I'm on my knees and they put me into the back of the cruiser and with multiple sclerosis, heat is definitely a factor and it was the 4th of July on the I-17.
[02:09:38.295 --> 02:09:40.837]  A lot of traffic is going by watching what's happening.
[02:09:40.837 --> 02:09:45.700]  As they put me back in there, he went to the vehicle which I was driving.
[02:09:45.700 --> 02:09:47.881]  It was a rental, a car rental.
[02:09:47.881 --> 02:09:52.644]  He did not explain anything to me and another cop came
[02:09:53.379 --> 02:09:53.759]  And what happened?
[02:09:53.759 --> 02:09:54.039]  What happened?
[02:10:22.549 --> 02:10:22.969]  I don't know.
[02:10:47.282 --> 02:10:49.923]  I came back toward the cruiser.
[02:10:49.923 --> 02:10:51.743]  I am his responsibility.
[02:10:51.743 --> 02:10:53.124]  He has to come to mama.
[02:10:53.124 --> 02:10:58.165]  They would not let me open, they would not open a window for me to simply whistle and call his name to have him come.
[02:10:58.165 --> 02:11:07.048]  It's all about control and power and it's such a war zone in Arizona and so many people are being killed and Mexico is collapsing that these type of things happen.
[02:11:07.048 --> 02:11:11.869]  But how did, and it's terrible because I mean I see the reports of where they go to the old woman's house.
[02:11:11.869 --> 02:11:14.210]  Her grandson hadn't lived there in 18 years.
[02:11:14.210 --> 02:11:15.170]  They got a drug warrant.
[02:11:15.610 --> 02:11:18.613]  She puts the little dog in the bathroom.
[02:11:18.613 --> 02:11:20.314]  They open the door and shoot the dog.
[02:11:20.314 --> 02:11:22.135]  I mean, it's just craziness.
[02:11:22.135 --> 02:11:26.439]  It's all this macho, you know, attitude and it's out of control.
[02:11:26.439 --> 02:11:28.481]  But, I mean, how did this end?
[02:11:28.481 --> 02:11:30.642]  They chased, basically, they lied to me.
[02:11:30.642 --> 02:11:32.284]  They said, dog will come back.
[02:11:32.284 --> 02:11:33.445]  They chased him to his death.
[02:11:34.225 --> 02:11:41.850]  He was hit by traffic on GAS 17 and I was never in front of him again.
[02:11:41.850 --> 02:11:50.234]  I had MS and he was my source of independence and on Independence Day he was taken from me.
[02:11:50.234 --> 02:11:54.717]  I'm so sorry Rosa Maria, but why did they say they pulled you over?
[02:11:54.717 --> 02:11:56.898]  I was not cited for anything.
[02:11:56.898 --> 02:12:00.480]  I was told that perhaps, I assumed, why would I be pulled over?
[02:12:00.480 --> 02:12:01.361]  Perhaps speeding?
[02:12:01.361 --> 02:12:03.022]  I was going with the flow of traffic.
[02:12:04.034 --> 02:12:06.377]  And they never cited me.
[02:12:06.377 --> 02:12:19.149]  And on the facebook.com slash justice for Duncan, spelled like Duncan Donuts, D-U-N-K-I-N, you can see the photographs of the incredible bruising on both my wrists
[02:12:19.369 --> 02:12:22.351]  We're going to put it up, we're going to put it up.
[02:12:22.351 --> 02:12:25.533]  Say that again, JusticeForDuncan, and that's on Facebook.
[02:12:25.533 --> 02:12:30.377]  Yes, facebook.com, yes, slash JusticeForDuncan, D-U-N-K-I-N.
[02:12:30.377 --> 02:12:40.143]  I also have a blog spot as well, that is at the JusticeForDuncan.blogspot.com, again, Duncan, D-U-N-K-I-N.
[02:12:40.143 --> 02:12:42.225]  Do they apologize for getting your dog killed?
[02:12:42.965 --> 02:12:44.046]  Absolutely nothing.
[02:12:44.046 --> 02:12:49.489]  And the first thing I did, because I'm an intelligent woman, I started to take pictures.
[02:12:49.489 --> 02:12:56.813]  As soon as my... I was there for three hours, Alex, on the side of the road, on the 4th of July, screaming... Yeah, but they showed you who the boss was.
[02:12:56.813 --> 02:13:00.735]  They didn't let you whistle for the dog, and that's what matters, is that government's your god.
[02:13:01.235 --> 02:13:04.117]  The good news is, in Arizona, they've revolted against the speed cameras.
[02:13:04.117 --> 02:13:05.298]  They're now removing them.
[02:13:05.298 --> 02:13:08.180]  People are wearing guns openly, and they're saying no to the tyranny.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:11.923]  And not all police are like that, but they are very cold, and they need some common sense.
[02:13:11.923 --> 02:13:13.504]  And I'll check into your story.
[02:13:13.504 --> 02:13:14.645]  I'm sorry to hear that, Rosa.
[02:13:14.645 --> 02:13:16.887]  I, you know, there's her little dog.
[02:13:16.887 --> 02:13:19.869]  A tiny little dog.
[02:13:19.869 --> 02:13:24.452]  In fact, blow that up for people on screen that are watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:13:24.452 --> 02:13:26.234]  Let's blow those photos up for people.
[02:13:26.234 --> 02:13:27.355]  This is just outrageous.
[02:13:28.342 --> 02:13:28.843]  I don't know.
[02:13:44.245 --> 02:13:47.107]  I was looking to move to Arizona.
[02:13:47.107 --> 02:13:51.229]  I lived in Arizona for almost 10 years and moved to New York, to Manhattan.
[02:13:51.229 --> 02:13:55.492]  And I was looking to re-establish myself there for our sake.
[02:13:55.492 --> 02:13:57.033]  For Duncan and my sake.
[02:13:57.033 --> 02:13:59.494]  He was my unconditional love.
[02:13:59.494 --> 02:14:01.275]  I looked forward to a time when we could go back.
[02:14:01.275 --> 02:14:05.478]  And now, Sedona, Arizona, the energy there is no good.
[02:14:05.478 --> 02:14:09.440]  And there's no way I'll go back there unless it is for President Trump.
[02:14:09.440 --> 02:14:10.441]  This is heart-rending.
[02:14:12.878 --> 02:14:16.721]  You know, we need police stopping criminals, not out there revenue generating.
[02:14:16.721 --> 02:14:21.424]  But again, they're now saying nationwide they're not going to respond to crime, only they're going to raise money.
[02:14:21.424 --> 02:14:25.927]  The police are being converted to tax collectors and good police that ask for help are not being given it.
[02:14:25.927 --> 02:14:27.148]  God bless you, Rosa Maria.
[02:14:27.148 --> 02:14:29.889]  I'm sorry to have to know that happened to you.
[02:14:29.889 --> 02:14:32.191]  It hurts my heart because I have dogs that I love.
[02:14:32.191 --> 02:14:36.033]  I have a Chihuahua and a French Bulldog and they're members of the family.
[02:14:36.033 --> 02:14:40.637]  I appreciate Glenn Spencer holding the last five minutes while we finished her story.
[02:14:40.637 --> 02:14:42.738]  But I wanted people to be able to have her finish up.
[02:14:43.239 --> 02:14:43.799]  Yeah, it certainly is.
[02:14:49.404 --> 02:14:53.405]  Glenn, for those that just joined us, you haven't been on in a while and we appreciate you coming on.
[02:14:53.405 --> 02:15:02.087]  Tell folks about your saga, working with Native American tribes, helping folks, being run out of L.A., being in Arizona, and you say things are really heating up there.
[02:15:02.087 --> 02:15:12.629]  We've had 17 machine gunned in Mexico just two days ago, car bombs going off, 40 people dying trying to come in just in one county at the corner.
[02:15:12.629 --> 02:15:15.950]  I mean, it is really disintegrating and Mexico is disintegrating.
[02:15:17.594 --> 02:15:19.135]  We know why it is.
[02:15:19.135 --> 02:15:20.916]  We've been trying to tell the people why it is.
[02:15:20.916 --> 02:15:22.076]  We know what started it.
[02:15:22.076 --> 02:15:26.138]  We know what caused the drug war to start in Mexico.
[02:15:26.138 --> 02:15:28.379]  We know why there is violence.
[02:15:28.379 --> 02:15:32.541]  We know why people are dying in the desert without being saved.
[02:15:32.541 --> 02:15:38.324]  But of course, it's only people like you who will give us a platform to explain to the people what's going on.
[02:15:40.595 --> 02:15:41.876]  Well, you've got drones up.
[02:15:41.876 --> 02:15:47.858]  We're putting up some photos you took from drones of just the hundreds of thousands of illegals pouring across.
[02:15:47.858 --> 02:15:50.019]  What do they estimate in Arizona alone a year?
[02:15:50.019 --> 02:15:52.080]  What is it, a half a million illegals come across?
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:53.300]  Well, probably, yeah.
[02:15:53.300 --> 02:16:01.163]  That's the total estimate of the number who actually get past Border Patrol and enter the United States through Arizona illegally.
[02:16:01.163 --> 02:16:03.064]  Nobody really knows because they don't want to know.
[02:16:03.064 --> 02:16:04.865]  They don't want the people to know what's going on.
[02:16:05.666 --> 02:16:22.419]  But what we've been doing for the last four and a half years is flying the border from the Gulf of Mexico, right along the border, 500 feet, videotaping every inch, taking hundreds and thousands of photographs, and plotting where the fence went in.
[02:16:22.419 --> 02:16:33.848]  But the important thing we learned, and we didn't know it when we were doing it, we didn't realize that the unintended result would be that we could then start relating, as the fence went in, what happened.
[02:16:34.975 --> 02:16:38.376]  I used to fly along the border near Yuma, Arizona.
[02:16:38.376 --> 02:16:43.518]  And there is a Goldwater bombing range there that runs right along the border.
[02:16:43.518 --> 02:16:49.781]  And you can't fly over it because it has a restricted airspace that goes up to 80,000 feet.
[02:16:49.781 --> 02:16:56.463]  But I made a special arrangement with the FAA to allow me to fly in Mexico along the border.
[02:16:56.463 --> 02:16:59.224]  I don't think anybody had ever thought of that.
[02:16:59.224 --> 02:17:04.206]  So we were able to get, starting four years ago, detailed
[02:17:05.029 --> 02:17:07.870]  Records of what that border looked like.
[02:17:07.870 --> 02:17:18.273]  When we started out, that Goldwater bombing range was one of the biggest drug smuggling corridors in the United States, if not the largest.
[02:17:18.273 --> 02:17:19.833]  We have documented evidence.
[02:17:19.833 --> 02:17:25.415]  Thousands and thousands of tire tracks running right off of Mexican Highway 2 up to Interstate 8.
[02:17:25.415 --> 02:17:26.115]  Now what happened?
[02:17:26.115 --> 02:17:31.296]  Because of the pressure that was put on them, they started building a fence in 2006, 2005, across that
[02:17:35.248 --> 02:17:36.909]  Smuggling Corridor.
[02:17:36.909 --> 02:17:38.450]  And they plugged it.
[02:17:38.450 --> 02:17:42.313]  They also plugged one between Yuma and Calexico, where all those sand doers are.
[02:17:42.313 --> 02:17:44.534]  You see all the dune buggies out there?
[02:17:44.534 --> 02:17:47.376]  At night, those dune buggies are usually loaded with drugs.
[02:17:47.376 --> 02:17:49.217]  That's now been plugged.
[02:17:49.217 --> 02:17:53.320]  Around Douglas and where I live now, they've plugged the drug corridor.
[02:17:53.320 --> 02:17:58.063]  But what I wondered, I said, look, this has had to have an impact.
[02:17:58.063 --> 02:18:01.945]  And this is available on our site, AmericanBorderPatrol.com.
[02:18:01.945 --> 02:18:04.647]  You look at the scroll down there, and you'll see something that says,
[02:18:05.447 --> 02:18:08.149]  The fence and the Mexican drug war.
[02:18:08.149 --> 02:18:09.830]  You take a look at that.
[02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:19.058]  And when you walk away, you will realize that it was the fence and vehicle barriers that started the Mexican drug war.
[02:18:19.058 --> 02:18:20.739]  That's what triggered it.
[02:18:20.739 --> 02:18:27.184]  You have the Sinaloa cartel have a major part of its smuggling corridor cut off.
[02:18:27.184 --> 02:18:32.748]  And they went to war with the Gulf cartels and some of the others for access.
[02:18:32.748 --> 02:18:33.429]  For access.
[02:18:33.429 --> 02:18:34.690]  And they're still fighting over it.
[02:18:35.788 --> 02:18:38.789]  And it's getting worse.
[02:18:38.789 --> 02:18:43.371]  And what we're arguing is, look, this is what started it.
[02:18:43.371 --> 02:18:48.012]  If you finish the fence, you would end it.
[02:18:48.012 --> 02:18:51.093]  Well, that's common sense, and I do think it's a major contributing factor.
[02:18:51.093 --> 02:19:00.116]  You also have the government of Mexico cracking down on the cartels, I guess to control the money to launder.
[02:19:00.116 --> 02:19:02.937]  Why would a government crack down on the cartels?
[02:19:03.607 --> 02:19:05.631]  Cause them to start killing each other.
[02:19:05.631 --> 02:19:06.933]  It doesn't make any sense.
[02:19:06.933 --> 02:19:09.398]  I've studied this for a year and a half.
[02:19:09.398 --> 02:19:14.507]  And if you look at all of the reports now that have been coming in for the last two years...
[02:19:15.302 --> 02:19:19.143]  They're fighting over access to drug smuggling corridors.
[02:19:19.143 --> 02:19:19.923]  No, no, that's admitted.
[02:19:19.923 --> 02:19:21.504]  I think it's one of the main contributing factors.
[02:19:21.504 --> 02:19:23.984]  I'm not disagreeing with you.
[02:19:23.984 --> 02:19:28.465]  When we talked to you yesterday about getting you on the show, you said things are really about to blow up.
[02:19:28.465 --> 02:19:29.606]  We're going to come back from break.
[02:19:29.606 --> 02:19:41.449]  I want to get into that with you and then also talk about the ranchers that have been murdered, the homes that have been burned down, everything that's happening in Arizona, and the federal response to come in and sue the state for the state simply saying if we
[02:19:42.329 --> 02:19:43.089]  I think so.
[02:20:01.889 --> 02:20:03.130]  Global meltdowns.
[02:20:03.130 --> 02:20:04.530]  Massive unemployment.
[02:20:04.530 --> 02:20:05.731]  Endless wars.
[02:20:05.731 --> 02:20:07.391]  A new currency crisis.
[02:20:07.391 --> 02:20:09.472]  Financially and morally bankrupt.
[02:20:09.472 --> 02:20:11.633]  A great and terrible storm is approaching.
[02:20:11.633 --> 02:20:13.514]  So what's the best way to get ready?
[02:20:13.514 --> 02:20:15.595]  To get prepared for hard times ahead.

[02:21:10.679 --> 02:21:12.960]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:21:12.960 --> 02:21:18.823]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:21:18.823 --> 02:21:25.067]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.

[02:22:31.532 --> 02:22:36.095]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.095 --> 02:22:41.919]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.919 --> 02:22:45.561]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:51.627 --> 02:23:52.027]  It works!
[02:24:22.924 --> 02:24:26.466]  Glenn Spencer is our guest joining us from Arizona.
[02:24:26.466 --> 02:24:38.355]  Glenn, let's talk about how this has changed Arizona and how the situation has unfolded and what's happening now that the feds are coming in saying they're going to try to block the state from having any law and order.
[02:24:41.451 --> 02:24:42.331]  Let me just say this.
[02:24:42.331 --> 02:24:51.736]  Russell Pierce, Senator Russell Pierce, was the brains and the political muscle behind the new Arizona law, AB 1070.
[02:24:51.736 --> 02:24:59.720]  Russell, the first time I met him two years ago, found out who I was, walked up to me at a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Phoenix.
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:02.082]  I'm not going to toot my horn, but let me tell you something.
[02:25:02.082 --> 02:25:04.063]  He said, you're my hero.
[02:25:04.063 --> 02:25:10.306]  He talked about the information that they're getting at the state level from the American Border Patrol and American Patrol website.
[02:25:11.502 --> 02:25:14.885]  So unlike the rest of the country, these people in Arizona know what's going on.
[02:25:14.885 --> 02:25:18.929]  Know the government is deliberately leaving the border open.
[02:25:18.929 --> 02:25:21.431]  The state is being overwhelmed.
[02:25:21.431 --> 02:25:22.712]  It's going broke.
[02:25:22.712 --> 02:25:28.777]  Paying for the services for people who shouldn't be here, that the government wants here, the federal government wants here.
[02:25:28.777 --> 02:25:31.019]  So they finally took some action.
[02:25:31.019 --> 02:25:32.601]  A positive step.
[02:25:32.601 --> 02:25:35.143]  And many people feel it wasn't strong enough.
[02:25:35.143 --> 02:25:37.505]  But essentially it's an implementation of federal law.
[02:25:38.556 --> 02:25:44.181]  And of course the open borders advocates, and it could have been George Bush or Barack Obama.
[02:25:44.181 --> 02:25:46.442]  I think the same thing would have happened.
[02:25:46.442 --> 02:25:48.204]  They do not want the law enforced.
[02:25:48.204 --> 02:25:50.025]  I've been at this for 18 years.
[02:25:50.025 --> 02:25:57.451]  I could spend the next 10 hours explaining to you the chapter and verse how they've defeated any attempt to enforce our laws.
[02:25:57.451 --> 02:25:59.172]  This is just another one.
[02:25:59.172 --> 02:26:05.938]  This is one of hundreds of efforts by the federal government and the left to defeat any attempt the Americans make
[02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:09.366]  To stop this invasion of their country.
[02:26:09.366 --> 02:26:13.228]  Because they know what I said 17 years ago is true.
[02:26:13.228 --> 02:26:17.731]  You won't know you're being invaded until you try to stop it.
[02:26:17.731 --> 02:26:25.636]  They know if we put up resistance, the backlash in Mexico and from those in the country illegally is going to be incredible.
[02:26:25.636 --> 02:26:34.441]  So it's going to expose the force and the terrific, subversive efforts put forth by our own government
[02:26:35.939 --> 02:26:39.864]  To destroy the United States.
[02:26:39.864 --> 02:26:41.346]  That's what frightens them to death.
[02:26:41.346 --> 02:26:46.152]  Because they know if the resistance is put up, it's going to expose the force.
[02:26:46.152 --> 02:26:47.494]  And that's what is about to happen.
[02:26:51.377 --> 02:26:52.837]  Let's talk about the carnage.
[02:26:52.837 --> 02:27:00.940]  I mean, Arizona, one of the lowest crime rates in history previously in the US, now has the highest kidnapping rate.
[02:27:00.940 --> 02:27:05.981]  And we see Mexico, and I've had anthropologists on to say it is officially a failed state.
[02:27:05.981 --> 02:27:10.922]  And are they just going to let this failed state collapse into Texas, Arizona, Nevada, California?
[02:27:10.922 --> 02:27:13.483]  Well, that's what they're doing.
[02:27:14.833 --> 02:27:17.135]  Now, you have to go back to my theory.
[02:27:17.135 --> 02:27:22.579]  My hypothesis is that it was the beginning, just the beginning of this construction of the fence.
[02:27:22.579 --> 02:27:26.683]  Again, putting up resistance, you begin to see the force.
[02:27:26.683 --> 02:27:36.631]  Now, if my theory is correct, what's happening is we just disrupted a $20-30 billion drug smuggling operation.
[02:27:36.631 --> 02:27:38.712]  People owe each other money.
[02:27:38.712 --> 02:27:40.694]  Millions and hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:27:41.235 --> 02:27:45.457]  And if they don't get this blow through, they owe somebody down at Onewata $500,000.
[02:27:45.457 --> 02:27:48.278]  They're gonna kill his family unless they get it.
[02:27:48.278 --> 02:27:51.759]  So he gets desperate, and he shoots somebody up here.
[02:27:51.759 --> 02:27:52.999]  Some gringo gets in the way.
[02:27:52.999 --> 02:27:56.801]  It's either him or, you know, his family.
[02:27:56.801 --> 02:28:03.143]  So now what they're doing is they're kidnapping illegal aliens because they're afloat, a cash flow.
[02:28:03.143 --> 02:28:07.104]  They don't pay these smugglers up front before they cross the border.
[02:28:07.104 --> 02:28:09.425]  What they do is they go into indentured slavery.
[02:28:12.286 --> 02:28:14.989]  And they pay a huge interest rate.
[02:28:14.989 --> 02:28:19.312]  They have to pay off these smuggling, these coyotes.
[02:28:19.312 --> 02:28:24.757]  So what they do is they kidnap each other's illegal aliens because it's a cash flow for them.
[02:28:24.757 --> 02:28:27.199]  So they tell them where to wire the money.
[02:28:27.199 --> 02:28:32.663]  And it's only going to get uglier because the drug lords are in serious cash flow trouble.
[02:28:32.663 --> 02:28:38.028]  So they're going after the illegal aliens and they're trying to smuggle more of them in, including terrorists, by the way.
[02:28:40.791 --> 02:28:42.851]  It is a mess.
[02:28:42.851 --> 02:28:45.892]  And until we seal that border, it's only going to get worse.
[02:28:45.892 --> 02:28:52.693]  Because these people are getting more desperate as every day goes by.
[02:28:52.693 --> 02:28:55.554]  Well, how is the federal government going to continue?
[02:28:55.554 --> 02:29:00.235]  Congressman Stark, three weeks ago, said there's no problem in Arizona with the border.
[02:29:00.235 --> 02:29:07.497]  And we've seen Senator Harry Reid say that there are no illegal aliens working in construction in Nevada.
[02:29:07.497 --> 02:29:09.357]  You know, I was at a town hall meeting.
[02:29:10.109 --> 02:29:13.914]  I just drove 20 miles of the border and I didn't see one border patrol agent.
[02:29:26.787 --> 02:29:28.728]  And she said, I talked to Commissioner Burson.
[02:29:28.728 --> 02:29:31.529]  He runs Customs and Border Protection.
[02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:39.872]  And he said, he told her over the phone and in a conference call, I don't want to call you a liar, but that's not what I told, what I have told.
[02:29:39.872 --> 02:29:42.052]  Well, I handed this lady a note.
[02:29:42.052 --> 02:29:46.054]  I have 30 videotape of that same 30 miles of the border.
[02:29:46.054 --> 02:29:47.834]  You can watch it online.
[02:29:47.834 --> 02:29:48.875]  Nobody there.
[02:29:48.875 --> 02:29:49.415]  Stay there.
[02:29:49.415 --> 02:29:49.975]  Stay there.
[02:29:49.975 --> 02:29:50.415]  Stay there.
[02:29:50.415 --> 02:29:51.276]  Let's talk about it.
[02:29:51.276 --> 02:29:52.676]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.676 --> 02:29:54.177]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.178 --> 02:29:57.884]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.788 --> 02:30:05.751]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:30:05.751 --> 02:30:06.751]  What have we got?
[02:30:06.751 --> 02:30:09.192]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:30:09.192 --> 02:30:10.213]  A republic.
[02:30:10.213 --> 02:30:12.854]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:30:12.854 --> 02:30:15.115]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:30:15.115 --> 02:30:17.136]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:30:17.136 --> 02:30:18.817]  So they think they own our land?
[02:30:18.817 --> 02:30:20.138]  They think they own our water?
[02:30:20.138 --> 02:30:20.758]  Children?
[02:30:20.758 --> 02:30:21.879]  Our education?
[02:30:21.879 --> 02:30:22.699]  Our money?
[02:30:22.699 --> 02:30:26.341]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:30:26.721 --> 02:30:31.687]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:30:31.687 --> 02:30:32.708]  We have the facts.
[02:30:32.708 --> 02:30:33.869]  We have the Constitution.
[02:30:33.869 --> 02:30:34.771]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:30:34.771 --> 02:30:35.672]  We have common law.
[02:30:35.672 --> 02:30:38.195]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:30:38.195 --> 02:30:41.979]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:30:42.059 --> 02:30:47.023]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:30:47.023 --> 02:30:48.525]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:30:48.525 --> 02:30:49.606]  Don't tread on me.
[02:30:49.606 --> 02:30:56.491]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:31:00.615 --> 02:31:05.176]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.176 --> 02:31:06.097]  Number one.
[02:31:06.097 --> 02:31:09.518]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.518 --> 02:31:10.378]  Number two.
[02:31:10.378 --> 02:31:15.260]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.260 --> 02:31:16.000]  It's true.
[02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:20.881]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:20.881 --> 02:31:21.702]  Number three.
[02:31:21.702 --> 02:31:25.283]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.283 --> 02:31:28.964]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.184 --> 02:31:29.985]  Number 4.
[02:31:29.985 --> 02:31:32.748]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:32.748 --> 02:31:36.432]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.432 --> 02:31:37.233]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.233 --> 02:31:41.378]  A solar-powered generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.378 --> 02:31:46.143]  Folks, I really believe in the solar-powered generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:10.754]  This is an American-made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[02:32:52.141 --> 02:32:52.421]  Thank you!
[02:33:08.865 --> 02:33:10.426]  Glenn Spencer is our guest.
[02:33:10.426 --> 02:33:17.948]  I keep going back to three years ago when we got the Security Prosperity Partnership, North American Union documents, when Judicial Watch sued and got them.
[02:33:17.948 --> 02:33:22.949]  And they say in there, we're going to use border crises as a way to merge the North American continent.
[02:33:22.949 --> 02:33:24.210]  We're going to let it get worse and worse.
[02:33:24.210 --> 02:33:29.491]  And what was Senator Kyle told by Barry Obama a few months ago?
[02:33:29.491 --> 02:33:34.573]  Mr. Sotaro, the fake president, said, I'm not going to fix that problem down there.
[02:33:35.573 --> 02:33:38.455]  I want it to be bad to get amnesty.
[02:33:38.455 --> 02:33:43.478]  Well, you're still going to have the drug smuggling and the coyotes and people that don't want to go through the amnesty route.
[02:33:43.478 --> 02:33:46.499]  I mean, this is how these people come into the country.
[02:33:46.499 --> 02:33:50.962]  And we are a nation of immigrants, and I'm all for people being able to come into the nation.
[02:33:50.962 --> 02:33:53.183]  But we have Brown Berets.
[02:33:53.183 --> 02:34:04.350]  Another video that surfaced last night, we're going to play a clip of it coming up here in a few minutes, where they come out to protest against the open borders in Arizona and California.
[02:34:05.816 --> 02:34:10.620]  And they say, hey, white people, you're not supposed to be here, you're Europeans, go back to Europe.
[02:34:10.620 --> 02:34:14.584]  And this woman, you know, looks like she's almost completely Spanish.
[02:34:14.584 --> 02:34:16.906]  I mean, she's as European as anybody else.
[02:34:16.906 --> 02:34:19.028]  And she's saying, go back to Europe, you Europeans.
[02:34:19.028 --> 02:34:21.730]  And the woman looks like she's Spanish.
[02:34:21.730 --> 02:34:23.832]  Looks like she has very little Indian blood in her.
[02:34:23.832 --> 02:34:31.619]  Look, I don't care if you're Indian, I don't care if you're Spanish, I don't care if you're Chinese, German, whatever, as long as you're not a socialist, as long as you're not anti-gun.
[02:34:32.540 --> 02:34:35.091]  Let's play that short clip and get Glenn Spencer's take on it.
[02:34:35.091 --> 02:34:36.738]  This was shot just a few days ago.
[02:34:36.738 --> 02:34:37.060]  Here it is.
[02:34:39.463 --> 02:34:40.464]  This is America!
[02:34:40.464 --> 02:34:42.345]  Look at your color!
[02:34:42.345 --> 02:34:43.146]  You're white!
[02:34:43.146 --> 02:34:45.087]  You don't belong here!
[02:34:45.087 --> 02:34:48.209]  Back to Europe!
[02:34:48.209 --> 02:34:49.930]  Back to Europe!
[02:34:49.930 --> 02:34:50.991]  Yes, ma'am!
[02:34:50.991 --> 02:34:51.892]  I'm Mexican!
[02:34:51.892 --> 02:34:53.693]  This was a Mexican law!
[02:34:53.693 --> 02:34:57.475]  And I'm still a Mexican, ma'am, because I'm here to remain!
[02:34:57.475 --> 02:34:58.876]  I'm here to remain!
[02:34:58.876 --> 02:35:02.379]  This is a Mexican law, because I'm here to remain!
[02:35:02.379 --> 02:35:02.959]  I'm Mexican!
[02:35:02.959 --> 02:35:03.519]  So what?
[02:35:05.154 --> 02:35:07.715]  Did you get yourself in?
[02:35:07.715 --> 02:35:09.396]  Brown Berets!
[02:35:09.396 --> 02:35:11.317]  No, I did!
[02:35:11.317 --> 02:35:18.120]  You know Brown Berets is a historical organization?
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:31.127]  You can watch the whole video, we got it linked on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I've seen the Brown Berets and other groups in LA, famous video with the image of police with their heads cut off with blonde hair, blue eyes, saying, you know, kill the gringos and
[02:35:31.807 --> 02:35:38.812]  It's just ongoing and I protested the Klan and I protested these groups and they're all big foundation funded, government funded.
[02:35:38.812 --> 02:35:42.874]  It just comes out over and over again to get us all at each other's throats.
[02:35:42.874 --> 02:35:46.697]  But the issue is, does this woman not know that Spain is as European as it gets?
[02:35:46.697 --> 02:35:49.198]  It's one of the oldest countries in Europe.
[02:35:49.198 --> 02:35:51.940]  That's who colonized Latin America.
[02:35:51.940 --> 02:35:54.102]  Cortez came in and overthrew Montezuma.
[02:35:54.862 --> 02:35:56.883]  And all of that craziness that was going on.
[02:36:14.133 --> 02:36:22.995]  And so to claim, because Mexico had a few missions there, it belongs to Mexico, why would people want to leave Mexico and come here if they want to make this Mexico in that system of government?
[02:36:22.995 --> 02:36:28.157]  And then we've got another map I'm going to put up, Glenn Spencer's comments on, this is from American Patrol, we'll give you those websites.
[02:36:28.157 --> 02:36:34.499]  We're one of the best sources for real intel, of where many of these Border Patrol sectors are over 100 miles apart.
[02:36:34.499 --> 02:36:38.240]  Look at that one in southwest Texas.
[02:36:38.240 --> 02:36:41.640]  That's got to be more than 100 miles away from the one in southern New Mexico.
[02:36:41.640 --> 02:36:43.041]  If there's one for New Mexico,
[02:36:43.661 --> 02:36:45.402]  There's two for Arizona.
[02:36:45.402 --> 02:36:47.864]  They're almost 80 miles to 100 miles off the border.
[02:36:47.864 --> 02:36:50.446]  There's one for Nevada.
[02:36:50.446 --> 02:36:52.247]  Two for California.
[02:36:52.247 --> 02:36:56.851]  And one of the biggest citizen complaints is that they're getting harassed.
[02:36:56.851 --> 02:36:58.872]  That's one of my problems with what Arizona's doing.
[02:36:58.872 --> 02:37:00.533]  I support it, but that is the problem.
[02:37:00.533 --> 02:37:07.538]  That the police and a lot of these sanctuary cities are going to use this as an excuse to harass citizens no matter what color they are.
[02:37:07.538 --> 02:37:09.820]  But that's a lot of issues I threw out, Glenn Spencer.
[02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:12.322]  First, give us your websites, and then let's get into the Brown Berets.
[02:37:12.898 --> 02:37:21.401]  Alright, AmericanPatrol.com is my personal website, my blog, and then the non-profit website is AmericanBorderPatrol.com.
[02:37:21.401 --> 02:37:23.881]  I've been up against the Brown Berets for years.
[02:37:23.881 --> 02:37:28.283]  Ten years ago I produced a documentary called The Conquest of Aztlan.
[02:37:28.283 --> 02:37:38.486]  And here I didn't just quote some jerk with the Brown Berets, I quoted the President of Mexico, I quoted the co-founder of the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund,
[02:37:39.150 --> 02:37:43.634]  Who said California is going to be a Hispanic state, and anybody who doesn't like it should leave.
[02:37:43.634 --> 02:37:49.720]  I had, I quoted Art Torres, then head of the California Democrat Party.
[02:37:49.720 --> 02:37:56.406]  He said Prop 187, that was the one that tried to stop funding for illegal aliens in California.
[02:37:56.406 --> 02:38:00.370]  He said that was the last gasp of white America in California.
[02:38:00.370 --> 02:38:02.171]  Did the mainstream media ever pick it up?
[02:38:02.171 --> 02:38:02.372]  No.
[02:38:02.372 --> 02:38:03.853]  I don't want to tell you, I don't want you to know that.
[02:38:05.063 --> 02:38:06.404]  They don't want anybody to know.
[02:38:06.404 --> 02:38:12.867]  You know, three weeks ago, the Arizona Republic went to produce a map of where the fence is on the border.
[02:38:12.867 --> 02:38:21.372]  They produced a great big map, but down, a tiny little print down at the bottom of it says the source for map and fence data, American Border Patrol.
[02:38:21.372 --> 02:38:25.634]  We're the only organization that has actually gone out and taken pictures and mapped where the fence is.
[02:38:25.634 --> 02:38:27.615]  You can see it on our website.
[02:38:27.615 --> 02:38:33.899]  We're the only organization that will fly along and show you that this deployment of National Guard on the border is a joke.
[02:38:34.830 --> 02:38:36.252]  That's a joke.
[02:38:36.252 --> 02:38:40.777]  And even Bonner, the former head of Customs and Border Protection, said it's a joke.
[02:38:40.777 --> 02:38:42.319]  But they're gonna make a big hand of it.
[02:38:42.319 --> 02:38:47.965]  Or we're gonna send all these 1,250 National Guard to the border.
[02:38:47.965 --> 02:38:52.991]  You know, that will give you about 30 lookout stations along the entire border.
[02:38:54.439 --> 02:39:05.005]  And when they wanted the dog and pony show with their National Guard at Yuma when President Bush was down there, they had 14 stations right along the river when he went there.
[02:39:05.005 --> 02:39:08.087]  They'll have a total of 30 National Guard lookout spots.
[02:39:08.087 --> 02:39:12.009]  And they show the American people this video and go, look, the border is secure.
[02:39:12.009 --> 02:39:14.771]  Meanwhile, it's wild west.
[02:39:14.771 --> 02:39:21.175]  They had them stacked up along the river, almost half of all of the National Guard that were deployed under Bush
[02:39:21.795 --> 02:39:23.697]  Right at the Colorado River.
[02:39:23.697 --> 02:39:26.319]  We have pictures of every one of them.
[02:39:26.319 --> 02:39:27.320]  It's a joke.
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:29.442]  The whole thing is a joke.
[02:39:29.442 --> 02:39:31.464]  The head of Customs and Border Protection
[02:39:32.273 --> 02:39:35.256]  First, he doesn't even know where the Border Patrol is or where they're not.
[02:39:35.256 --> 02:39:39.261]  They lied to him!
[02:39:39.261 --> 02:39:40.522]  It is, it is a lie.
[02:39:40.522 --> 02:39:43.605]  One of our buddies, he has these trail cameras, okay?
[02:39:43.605 --> 02:39:46.709]  And they've been making a deal out of this in some of the media lately.
[02:39:46.709 --> 02:39:50.292]  700, he's got pictures of 700 people going up on one trail!
[02:39:52.603 --> 02:39:53.903]  Uh, in 40 days.
[02:39:53.903 --> 02:39:55.744]  I flew to see a brother of Fox News.
[02:39:55.744 --> 02:39:59.725]  He and I and the Fox News reporter went on a detour where it was.
[02:39:59.725 --> 02:40:01.426]  There were all kinds of trails.
[02:40:01.426 --> 02:40:01.986]  Hundreds of them.
[02:40:01.986 --> 02:40:03.986]  Just like it.
[02:40:03.986 --> 02:40:05.947]  So, it is open.
[02:40:05.947 --> 02:40:07.687]  The Border Patrol is not on the border.
[02:40:07.687 --> 02:40:08.408]  They're backstopping.
[02:40:10.046 --> 02:40:12.068]  They're lying through their teeth.
[02:40:12.068 --> 02:40:13.550]  They will not enforce the border.
[02:40:13.550 --> 02:40:15.452]  They will try to stop anybody who will try.
[02:40:29.206 --> 02:40:29.506]  Absolutely.
[02:40:50.307 --> 02:40:56.570]  Well, what our government is so frightened of is that if they crack down on the border there's going to be complete chaos.
[02:40:56.570 --> 02:40:58.751]  And there could be a major border incident.
[02:40:58.751 --> 02:41:00.612]  And this is a scenario that I see unfolding.
[02:41:21.050 --> 02:41:24.432]  It could be a major border incident, especially at El Paso.
[02:41:24.432 --> 02:41:27.074]  Or there's a major shootout.
[02:41:27.074 --> 02:41:30.817]  And lots of people killed.
[02:41:30.817 --> 02:41:38.642]  And then I see kind of a Rodney King type riot spreading through places like Los Angeles and along the border.
[02:41:40.106 --> 02:41:52.671]  Well the illegals, the Mexican Mafia is already saying kill Sheriff Babu and others that are trying to enforce the law so we could see the same type of terrorism, and that is terrorism going on in Mexico, if anything's terror, where they go and kill U.S.
[02:41:52.671 --> 02:41:55.512]  Embassy people, it's already happening, to send a message.
[02:41:55.512 --> 02:41:56.993]  Right.
[02:41:56.993 --> 02:42:02.595]  Now that's right, and so, but I see this ending up in major civil unrest inside the United States.
[02:42:06.612 --> 02:42:08.073]  And what's the trigger?
[02:42:08.073 --> 02:42:09.533]  Mexican troops or cartels?
[02:42:09.533 --> 02:42:10.434]  Could be anything.
[02:42:10.434 --> 02:42:14.955]  Kill a bunch of our police, then finally our police kill a bunch of them, and then the war's on.
[02:42:14.955 --> 02:42:18.376]  That's it.
[02:42:18.376 --> 02:42:29.180]  Well, the politically correct people just say that we're supposed to lay down and die, and that this is good, and it'll be our fault when the La Reconquista, La Invasora burns down half the country.
[02:42:30.137 --> 02:42:33.681]  As I said, you won't know you're being invaded until you try to stop it.
[02:42:33.681 --> 02:42:37.464]  The people are demanding that we secure our borders.
[02:42:37.464 --> 02:42:40.407]  There is going to be a backlash against that.
[02:42:40.407 --> 02:42:42.469]  And it's going to be serious.
[02:42:42.469 --> 02:42:44.231]  And our government knows it.
[02:42:44.231 --> 02:42:47.194]  That's why they're so frightened of the issue.
[02:42:47.194 --> 02:42:48.796]  It could have been taken care of years ago.
[02:42:49.662 --> 02:42:57.768]  But they kept putting it off, putting it off, delaying the inevitable, and now it's going to be much, much worse to clean this thing up.
[02:42:57.768 --> 02:43:11.058]  Well, Glenn, as the world goes into a depression, as crime spikes and the only, you know, real crop Mexico's got other than drugs and money laundering is terrorism, that's dying right now because the police themselves will kidnap you and extort money.
[02:43:11.058 --> 02:43:13.399]  That was even in the Wall Street Journal yesterday.
[02:43:13.399 --> 02:43:16.362]  So as Mexico sinks into oblivion,
[02:43:17.382 --> 02:43:20.906]  It's only a matter of time until the refugee numbers even increase higher.
[02:43:20.906 --> 02:43:28.733]  And then as our states go into bankruptcy, 46 of them on the verge of bankruptcy, according to Bloomberg's analysis.
[02:43:28.733 --> 02:43:34.778]  I mean, it's only common sense we've got to protect the country and stop this.
[02:43:34.778 --> 02:43:39.503]  And so I see the depression only exacerbating this.
[02:43:40.413 --> 02:43:43.634]  Absolutely, and believe me, Obama will not protect that border.
[02:43:43.634 --> 02:43:49.835]  If anything, he's trying to figure out a way to grant blanket amnesty without going through Congress.
[02:43:49.835 --> 02:43:58.938]  He'll give him de facto amnesty by not enforcing the law, and that's why he is so opposed to the Arizona law.
[02:43:58.938 --> 02:44:07.100]  Because the Arizona law suggests that there could be immigration reduction, illegal immigration reduction, through attrition.
[02:44:07.100 --> 02:44:08.660]  In other words, people would start leaving.
[02:44:09.720 --> 02:44:22.647]  And that's, by the way, one of the legal arguments that they made against the Arizona law was that it is not the federal government's policy to have illegal immigration reduced through a train.
[02:44:22.647 --> 02:44:23.728]  Well, I'll tell you a story.
[02:44:23.728 --> 02:44:25.789]  Last night, I was home at about 6.30.
[02:44:25.789 --> 02:44:27.950]  We'd finished dinner, and I was there.
[02:44:27.950 --> 02:44:36.794]  They're building a house right across the street from me, and I was watching a bunch of illegal aliens that were over there building, and they were done.
[02:44:38.175 --> 02:45:07.199]  And they were like arguing with each other and they were running up to the fence that was on the back of that house that their building's property and they were catcalling women that were jogging by and then one of them looked crazy and these guys I mean just 10 years ago illegals didn't look didn't look and act like this and I'm seeing it at gas stations other places wild-eyed crazy angry and one guy was walking around with a hammer acting nuts and cars were driving by and people didn't know what to make of it and it just seems like more and more of the illegals
[02:45:08.322 --> 02:45:08.542]  I think?
[02:45:29.549 --> 02:45:34.972]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[02:45:34.972 --> 02:45:45.616]  I've been in a lot of these immigrant neighborhoods when I played football in Dallas and I had Hispanic friends who lived in some of these poorer areas and I'd go there to have lunch with them or play basketball or whatever.
[02:45:45.616 --> 02:45:46.857]  They were nice people.
[02:45:46.857 --> 02:45:48.598]  And now I drive through these areas and
[02:45:49.258 --> 02:46:08.815]  It's I think through the the the Hispanic rap and the country music they glorify the drug dealers and the gangster society and I think that MS-13 Mexican Mafia thing is spread and I mean I was watching these guys and I'm somebody who's not scared easily and I wasn't scared I felt aggression as I was looking out the window these guys look crazy
[02:46:09.335 --> 02:46:10.456]  I mean, they were wild-eyed.
[02:46:10.456 --> 02:46:15.942]  I mean, they looked like Desperados out of a Clint Eastwood movie.
[02:46:15.942 --> 02:46:20.687]  These guys look crazier and meaner than Tuco in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.
[02:46:20.687 --> 02:46:23.930]  And I was just going, my God, you know, where on earth are these?
[02:46:23.930 --> 02:46:25.231]  I mean, they look wild.
[02:46:25.231 --> 02:46:30.277]  And they were, again, walking around with hammers and arguing with each other like they were on PCP or something.
[02:46:30.277 --> 02:46:31.118]  I mean, have you seen this?
[02:46:32.060 --> 02:46:32.920]  Oh, I haven't.
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:40.541]  You know, amazingly enough, where I live here near the border, there's so many border patrol agents that live in this little town of Sierra Vista nearby.
[02:46:40.541 --> 02:46:42.422]  We hardly have any illegal aliens.
[02:46:42.422 --> 02:46:44.982]  There's very few Hispanics here.
[02:46:44.982 --> 02:46:47.903]  We don't have the experience that you're seeing there.
[02:46:47.903 --> 02:46:58.885]  But, you know, these people have been used for 20 years to being able to walk right into this country and flaunt the law from their noses.
[02:46:58.885 --> 02:47:01.285]  And I think they now feel a sort of
[02:47:01.949 --> 02:47:07.455]  But that change, and I want you to continue, isn't just that we're going into a depression.
[02:47:19.548 --> 02:47:28.493]  I mean, the deal is, Americans, and I'm glad to see a lot of Hispanics speaking out against this, we see radio stations are named The Invasion, or The Race.
[02:47:28.493 --> 02:47:31.414]  We see air conditioner companies named The Race.
[02:47:31.414 --> 02:47:36.017]  We see La Raza and Mecha, and we see the NAACP saying we don't help
[02:47:36.437 --> 02:47:41.640]  Yeah, you know, government officials with the Department of Agriculture, we don't help white people because they're scum.
[02:47:41.640 --> 02:47:52.827]  I mean, and the thing is, you've got all these white yuppies that are guilty and really do want to like everybody and were taught to be guilty and who are saying, you know what, I'm not guilty anymore.
[02:47:52.827 --> 02:47:53.768]  I'm not scum.
[02:47:53.768 --> 02:47:54.508]  I'm not bad.
[02:47:54.508 --> 02:47:56.790]  And I'm tired of this.
[02:47:56.790 --> 02:48:02.053]  And really, I think that's what the race crowd has now figured out.
[02:48:02.053 --> 02:48:02.793]  And I agree with you.
[02:48:03.974 --> 02:48:05.875]  It's going to get nasty very soon, Glenn.
[02:48:05.875 --> 02:48:08.036]  How do you see that being triggered?
[02:48:08.036 --> 02:48:11.518]  Oh, I think any number of ways.
[02:48:11.518 --> 02:48:17.141]  Once again, you've seen more and more conflict right along the border.
[02:48:17.141 --> 02:48:26.666]  I could see that being triggered in El Paso, or any place like Nogales, or even right here, right near me, Naco.
[02:48:30.232 --> 02:48:33.293]  They just had a big gang fight just south of my ranch.
[02:48:33.293 --> 02:48:35.054]  People were killed.
[02:48:35.054 --> 02:48:39.635]  There was a couple of years ago, they shut down the school here.
[02:48:39.635 --> 02:48:40.095]  A U.S.
[02:48:40.095 --> 02:48:40.936]  school on the U.S.
[02:48:40.936 --> 02:48:45.077]  side because they heard a large Mexican gang was headed for Naco, Arizona.
[02:48:45.077 --> 02:48:49.898]  Well, I mean, look, two months ago, and of the six kids, four were Hispanic.
[02:48:49.898 --> 02:48:54.360]  They were wearing old Navy shirts with an American flag.
[02:48:55.380 --> 02:48:55.500]  And
[02:49:11.334 --> 02:49:13.556]  Well, I wanted to mention one thing that is very subtle, but very significant.
[02:49:37.594 --> 02:49:43.336]  When you see these large crowds that are out demonstrating in favor of amnesty and against law enforcement.
[02:49:43.336 --> 02:49:44.996]  They used to carry Mexican flags.
[02:49:44.996 --> 02:49:47.097]  They don't do that as much anymore.
[02:49:47.097 --> 02:49:50.578]  But look for something that very few people notice it.
[02:49:50.578 --> 02:49:53.399]  Most of them are wearing white shirts.
[02:49:53.399 --> 02:49:55.560]  You see a sea of white.
[02:49:55.560 --> 02:49:55.800]  Why?
[02:49:55.800 --> 02:49:57.620]  They've been told to.
[02:49:57.620 --> 02:50:00.561]  They've been told to wear white shirts.
[02:50:00.561 --> 02:50:05.123]  Now what wears a uniform and takes orders?
[02:50:05.123 --> 02:50:05.403]  An army.
[02:50:06.843 --> 02:50:07.304]  These people
[02:50:21.072 --> 02:50:40.621]  No, the Spanish media, because my wife, you know, lived, I guess, five years in Madrid, so she speaks fluent Spanish, and she's the one always pointing it out, but I mean, it's the standard thing, is we're taking over, the green goes evil, we're gonna bring down America, we're communism, we're gonna get the guns, and then the average idiot American has no idea this is going on.
[02:50:41.221 --> 02:50:42.101]  It's perfect.
[02:50:42.101 --> 02:50:43.602]  It's a foreign army.
[02:50:43.602 --> 02:50:47.904]  And then Hispanics who want to be Americans, great people, they're intimidated.
[02:50:47.904 --> 02:50:48.904]  They call in all the time.
[02:50:48.904 --> 02:50:52.025]  They're told, no, you've got to join the Infasora, the invasion.
[02:50:52.025 --> 02:50:54.106]  You've got to join the La Reconquista.
[02:50:54.106 --> 02:50:55.907]  The final segment with Glenn Spencer.
[02:50:55.907 --> 02:50:57.688]  Folks, I want everybody to live in peace.
[02:50:57.688 --> 02:50:59.088]  I want to save the Republic.
[02:50:59.088 --> 02:51:01.349]  That's why we talk about these tough issues.
[02:51:01.349 --> 02:51:05.250]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:05.250 --> 02:51:09.052]  My name is Span and I'm 68 years old and I live in Vermont.
[02:51:09.457 --> 02:51:14.181]  In the spring of 2003, I started to have problems with my heart.
[02:51:14.181 --> 02:51:16.282]  It felt like my heart was pounding.
[02:51:16.282 --> 02:51:17.984]  Made me feel breathless.
[02:51:17.984 --> 02:51:22.427]  I tried many, many different things to try to get some help for myself.
[02:51:22.427 --> 02:51:23.508]  Nothing did anything.
[02:51:23.508 --> 02:51:27.491]  Heart and Body Extract is very powerful, very effective, and works quickly.
[02:51:27.491 --> 02:51:31.615]  I saw one of Sharon's ads and ordered Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:31.615 --> 02:51:34.257]  I noticed a difference quickly, within days.
[02:51:34.697 --> 02:51:39.721]  The episodes became less frequent and by a month I completely vanished.
[02:51:39.721 --> 02:51:42.523]  Usually you find a 30-day or 60-day guarantee.

[02:51:50.409 --> 02:51:51.930]  866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[02:52:00.919 --> 02:52:05.903]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:52:05.903 --> 02:52:06.883]  What have we got?
[02:52:06.883 --> 02:52:09.345]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:52:09.345 --> 02:52:10.346]  A republic.
[02:52:10.346 --> 02:52:12.988]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:52:12.988 --> 02:52:15.250]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:52:15.250 --> 02:52:17.291]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:52:17.291 --> 02:52:18.972]  So they think they own our land?
[02:52:18.972 --> 02:52:20.293]  They think they own our water?
[02:52:20.293 --> 02:52:20.894]  Children?
[02:52:20.894 --> 02:52:22.015]  Our education?
[02:52:22.015 --> 02:52:22.855]  Our money?
[02:52:22.855 --> 02:52:26.518]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:52:26.858 --> 02:52:30.562]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:52:30.562 --> 02:52:31.824]  You're being warned.
[02:52:31.824 --> 02:52:32.845]  We have the facts.
[02:52:32.845 --> 02:52:34.006]  We have the Constitution.
[02:52:34.006 --> 02:52:34.928]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:52:34.928 --> 02:52:35.809]  We have common law.
[02:52:35.809 --> 02:52:38.332]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:38.332 --> 02:52:42.116]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[02:52:42.216 --> 02:52:47.161]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:52:47.161 --> 02:52:48.663]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:52:48.663 --> 02:52:49.744]  Don't tread on me.

[02:54:04.014 --> 02:54:10.659]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:54:10.659 --> 02:54:13.641]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:27.071 --> 02:54:31.014]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a few minutes left with Glenn Spencer.
[02:54:31.014 --> 02:54:33.295]  And, you know, I live near the border.
[02:54:33.295 --> 02:54:34.316]  I live in Texas.
[02:54:34.316 --> 02:54:37.558]  And I want to live in peace with everybody.
[02:54:37.558 --> 02:54:38.899]  It's very simple.
[02:54:38.899 --> 02:54:42.982]  You look at any child, a white child, a Hispanic child, Asian, black, it doesn't matter.
[02:54:42.982 --> 02:54:46.044]  You love children because they're human beings.
[02:54:46.044 --> 02:54:50.087]  And then people grow up, become adults, and they get filled with all this propaganda.
[02:54:50.087 --> 02:54:56.111]  And none of us are perfect, but there's a very self-righteous belief that the wealth of the United States was stolen from Mexico, which is not true.
[02:54:57.212 --> 02:54:59.193]  And that the United States is pure evil.
[02:54:59.193 --> 02:55:06.596]  No, it's the big corporations who all are for open borders that are creating so much of our heartache.
[02:55:06.596 --> 02:55:09.597]  And as we go into a depression, people are going to fight over resources.
[02:55:09.597 --> 02:55:16.360]  I mean, 7 million Americans are estimated by university studies to have starved during the 10 years of the Great Depression.
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:18.361]  And even more in Europe.
[02:55:18.361 --> 02:55:24.083]  And if we go into a real depression, we're already going into the beginnings of one, it's going to create incredible pressure.
[02:55:24.083 --> 02:55:25.644]  And if you've got a bunch of self-righteous people
[02:55:26.294 --> 02:55:30.836]  You know, listening to Spanish media, where it's get the gringo, this and that all day long.
[02:55:30.836 --> 02:55:32.976]  It is going to be explosive, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:32.976 --> 02:55:38.258]  And the globalists are going to come in and restore law and order at the expense of everybody's freedoms, and I'm against that.
[02:55:38.258 --> 02:55:40.399]  Glenn Spencer, we've got about three, four minutes left.
[02:55:40.399 --> 02:55:42.580]  Closing comments on what we've been discussing here.
[02:55:42.580 --> 02:55:47.682]  Well, you know, on July 14th, John McCain went on a record with Greta Thunberg.
[02:55:47.682 --> 02:55:50.503]  He was talking about why Obama was suing Arizona.
[02:55:51.212 --> 02:55:57.776]  And he said, more and more, I am convinced that this is all about solidifying the Hispanic vote.
[02:55:57.776 --> 02:56:01.739]  Now when you think about it, and then people came on after that and said the same thing.
[02:56:01.739 --> 02:56:05.301]  Now if you think about that, wait a minute.
[02:56:05.301 --> 02:56:10.945]  Obama is suing the state of Arizona because he wants to solidify his Hispanic base.
[02:56:10.945 --> 02:56:11.385]  64% of U.S.
[02:56:11.385 --> 02:56:14.407]  Hispanics are of Mexican origin.
[02:56:14.407 --> 02:56:17.249]  So he believes, Obama must believe,
[02:56:17.992 --> 02:56:23.645]  That the vast majority of Hispanics want an open book?
[02:56:23.645 --> 02:56:24.467]  Now that's the case!
[02:56:26.158 --> 02:56:29.280]  Well, what they're doing is they're selling the idea.
[02:56:29.280 --> 02:56:32.683]  I mean, it's like headlines against Bob Dole in 96.
[02:56:32.683 --> 02:56:34.605]  Women support Clinton more.
[02:56:34.605 --> 02:56:37.047]  And then other women say, well, then I support Clinton.
[02:56:37.047 --> 02:56:38.127]  I'm not saying Bob Dole was good.
[02:56:38.127 --> 02:56:40.409]  The point is, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[02:56:40.409 --> 02:56:44.032]  Like, everybody knows it's a conspiracy to say there's a new world order.
[02:56:44.032 --> 02:56:47.815]  And then weak-minded people hear that and say, well, I'm not for conspiracy theories.
[02:56:47.815 --> 02:56:53.800]  When I've seen Gallup polls up into the high 70s, low 80s of Hispanic Americans that are against open borders, I mean,
[02:56:54.940 --> 02:56:57.282]  General Obama is wrong.
[02:56:57.282 --> 02:56:59.504]  And John McCain is wrong.
[02:56:59.504 --> 02:57:00.665]  But they mean to be wrong.
[02:57:00.665 --> 02:57:02.506]  It's part of globalism.
[02:57:02.506 --> 02:57:06.930]  They just say it's what Hispanics want.
[02:57:06.930 --> 02:57:07.950]  Okay.
[02:57:07.950 --> 02:57:11.893]  Well, I hope you're right.
[02:57:11.893 --> 02:57:16.937]  You know, this is something that we need to watch very carefully.
[02:57:16.937 --> 02:57:21.981]  And if it isn't the case, I think you have Hispanic leaders who have an obligation to speak out.
[02:57:21.981 --> 02:57:23.142]  Say, no, this isn't true.
[02:57:23.142 --> 02:57:24.143]  We're not broke or bordered.
[02:57:25.702 --> 02:57:30.963]  Oh, I agree that most of the Hispanic leaders are bought and paid for by the globalists.
[02:57:30.963 --> 02:57:34.004]  I mean, look at how the Fortune 500 funds all this.
[02:57:34.004 --> 02:57:37.185]  Well, you know, these arguments are difficult.
[02:57:37.185 --> 02:57:40.906]  They're a difficult subject, but the one thing that is very simple.
[02:57:40.906 --> 02:57:42.126]  I'm down on the border.
[02:57:42.126 --> 02:57:46.668]  We have a law that says it's illegal to come into the United States, and we're not enforcing it.
[02:57:46.668 --> 02:57:52.349]  And what American Border Patrol does on a regular basis is to prove to the American people that the government is lying to them.
[02:57:53.567 --> 02:57:58.949]  And then they can make whatever decisions they want to make regarding the future of the politicians who represent them.
[02:57:58.949 --> 02:58:04.130]  Well, bottom line, we're not going to have a country anymore if we decide to let anybody in and get rid of our borders.
[02:58:04.130 --> 02:58:05.330]  And that's what the globalists want.
[02:58:05.330 --> 02:58:09.031]  You've talked about how they're sacrificing our country on the altar of globalism.
[02:58:09.031 --> 02:58:09.571]  That is correct.
[02:58:09.571 --> 02:58:10.952]  That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:58:10.952 --> 02:58:15.613]  And Calderon copied all the other Mexican presidents and said the Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[02:58:15.613 --> 02:58:17.794]  Oh, they all believe that.
[02:58:17.794 --> 02:58:21.355]  All the polls in Mexico show that that is the case.
[02:58:21.355 --> 02:58:21.895]  They believe that.
[02:58:24.281 --> 02:58:27.085]  Well, it's just not going to work.
[02:58:27.085 --> 02:58:34.095]  I mean, you're not going to merge a third world imploding road warrior society with the United States, but the globalists are trying it.
[02:58:34.095 --> 02:58:36.138]  Glenn Spencer, thank you so much for your time.
[02:58:36.138 --> 02:58:36.718]  Thank you, Ron.
[02:58:36.718 --> 02:58:37.580]  Thank you so much.
