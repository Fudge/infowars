[00:00.000 --> 00:12.100]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.100 --> 00:36.820]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.820 --> 00:41.740]  welcome my friends welcome and thank you for joining us it is Tuesday the 20th
[00:41.740 --> 00:47.460]  day of July 2010 and we're going to be live here for the next three hours we
[00:47.460 --> 00:52.860]  have Steve Watson joining us from London to break down a lot of important
[00:52.860 --> 00:56.940]  world news and give us his perspective predominantly we're going to be talking
[00:56.940 --> 01:02.140]  about this incredible report that broke yesterday this is not new news to our
[01:02.140 --> 01:07.580]  audience but it's new news to the world a hidden world growing beyond control
[01:07.580 --> 01:20.100]  top secret America 854,000 plus private corporate executives in every town and
[01:20.100 --> 01:27.620]  city who are at the same level as FBI and NSA the highest security clearances
[01:27.620 --> 01:34.540]  in the country I've looked at past numbers there were maybe 5,000 people in
[01:34.540 --> 01:38.020]  the government a decade ago that had a clearance this high and that's in the
[01:38.020 --> 01:45.220]  government there are more security clearances now in corporate positions
[01:45.220 --> 01:51.340]  and there are in government this is the Fortune 100 becoming the government this
[01:51.340 --> 01:56.140]  is a full corporate overthrow of the United States these corporations are
[01:56.140 --> 02:03.700]  bigger than most nation-states GDP every year and chief among the NSA
[02:03.700 --> 02:10.100]  fronts is Google and that's also in the article Google isn't allowed to go out
[02:10.100 --> 02:16.020]  and illegally grab everybody's wireless data because the government likes them
[02:16.020 --> 02:21.180]  Google's allowed to do this because Google is the government people say well
[02:21.180 --> 02:24.420]  then why do you fight on Google why do you use Google because that's where the
[02:24.420 --> 02:30.820]  war is they're able to predict mob psychology to almost a hundred percent
[02:30.820 --> 02:35.460]  with long-term trends they're able to predict individual actions with over a
[02:35.460 --> 02:41.900]  90% accuracy and that's something they admit this is an NSA tracking system but
[02:41.900 --> 02:45.660]  they need more data so they set it up to control the internet and Google says
[02:45.660 --> 02:49.940]  they want to be the internet they're allowed to break the rules when no other
[02:49.940 --> 02:54.980]  corporation is to this level to consolidate control so they get all the
[02:54.980 --> 03:00.580]  real-time data that's then tied into all the RFID and smart dust being implanted
[03:00.580 --> 03:05.140]  in all the new products to track everything in the real world not just in
[03:05.140 --> 03:08.620]  cyberspace and they do that off your cell phone tracking where you're at in
[03:08.620 --> 03:12.180]  real time they can dial in and listen to you off what you're surfing on your
[03:12.180 --> 03:16.340]  internet off your license plates that are being scanned by the license plate
[03:16.340 --> 03:22.340]  reading cameras and put through the Google NSA grid Google is the public
[03:22.340 --> 03:28.780]  persona of the National Security Agency but the National Security it's agency
[03:28.780 --> 03:34.220]  is being absorbed itself into the corporate Google so really to properly
[03:34.220 --> 03:40.540]  state this it isn't that the NSA created Google though they did with DARPA it's
[03:40.540 --> 03:46.900]  that it was created to absorb everything to absorb the internet to absorb the
[03:46.900 --> 03:53.860]  government to absorb how you pay your power bills to absorb you know the phone
[03:53.860 --> 03:59.980]  companies to absorb the computer manufacturing to control everything
[03:59.980 --> 04:04.260]  Google for what five years has been selling electrical power it is meant
[04:04.260 --> 04:07.980]  to take over everything and of course are the biggest promoters along with BP
[04:07.980 --> 04:12.860]  and other criminal organizations of the global carbon tax so that that's always
[04:12.860 --> 04:17.700]  the government joke you know don't be evil somebody tells you oh don't be
[04:17.700 --> 04:22.900]  evil there's big powerful organization you know they're actually planning evil
[04:22.900 --> 04:26.660]  and they've got all these you know well-meaning leftist and people that
[04:26.660 --> 04:31.020]  are compartmentalized and don't see the larger picture of what's going on so
[04:31.020 --> 04:37.220]  just giant developments on that front huge BP news huge financial news

[09:27.420 --> 09:32.260]  the toll-free number to join us let's go ahead and dive straight into a news
[09:32.260 --> 09:39.260]  blitz right now the feds are saying BP's cap stays on new leaks are insignificant
[09:39.260 --> 09:43.620]  this is out of the associated press from New Orleans and they're saying that
[09:43.620 --> 09:46.780]  yes there's some other leaks in the area but they're not associated with this
[09:46.780 --> 09:51.260]  there's just oil coming up as far as 20 miles away from cracks in the ocean
[09:51.260 --> 09:55.580]  floor but that's no problem and they've lied at least three separate times
[09:55.580 --> 09:59.020]  claiming they've capped the well so I'd love I would love to believe all of this
[09:59.020 --> 10:04.820]  but who knows what the real truth is time will tell oil from BP's blowout well
[10:04.820 --> 10:08.020]  is against seeping into the Gulf of Mexico but this time more slowly and
[10:08.020 --> 10:12.020]  scientists aren't convinced the cap that stopped the flow last week is making
[10:12.020 --> 10:17.820]  things worse the government said Monday that oil was seeping into the Gulf after
[10:17.820 --> 10:23.140]  days of warning that the experimental cap on the well would cause more leaks
[10:23.140 --> 10:29.740]  that's because down in the drill hole itself it shattered despite what a first
[10:29.740 --> 10:32.700]  seemed a setback though the federal government declared the development
[10:32.700 --> 10:37.260]  insignificant and forged ahead with BP's plan to for finally sealing the hole in
[10:37.260 --> 10:42.900]  the ocean floor but if for 80 plus days it's been blasting up and if they had
[10:42.900 --> 10:48.780]  fissures down in the drill hole and they didn't successfully frack it as they
[10:48.780 --> 10:54.420]  call it then how is capping capping it gonna fix anything if there's already
[10:54.420 --> 11:01.260]  other holes down beneath so this just sounds like incredible spin ever since
[11:01.260 --> 11:05.340]  the cap was used to bottle the oil last week engineers have been watching
[11:05.340 --> 11:08.300]  underwater cameras and monitoring pressure and seismic readings to see
[11:08.300 --> 11:11.820]  whether the well would hold or spring a new leak perhaps one that could rupture
[11:11.820 --> 11:15.260]  the seafloor and make the disaster even worse small amounts of oil and gas
[11:15.260 --> 11:19.860]  started coming from the cap Sunday but we do not believe it is consequential at
[11:19.860 --> 11:25.180]  this time retired Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen said also seepage from the
[11:25.180 --> 11:30.540]  seafloor was detected over the weekend less than two miles away but Allen said
[11:30.540 --> 11:36.900]  probably had nothing to do with the well hmm that doesn't make sense oil and
[11:36.900 --> 11:40.300]  gas are known to ooze naturally from fissures in the bottom of the Gulf of
[11:40.300 --> 11:46.020]  Mexico which they do occasionally do so let's pray they're telling us the
[11:46.020 --> 11:50.460]  truth the problem is they normally lie even when the truth would suit them they
[11:50.460 --> 11:56.300]  tend to lie it's just their modus operandi you know the old wasn't an
[11:56.300 --> 12:01.940]  African parable about the scorpion and the frog and the scorpion comes over to
[12:01.940 --> 12:05.540]  the frog and says we let me ride on your back across the river and the frog says
[12:05.540 --> 12:08.860]  no you're a scorpion you'll sting me and kill me and he says no I promise I
[12:08.860 --> 12:13.100]  won't I'm I want to be friendly I've you know I've changed my ways and the nice
[12:13.100 --> 12:16.740]  frog says okay go ahead and climb on my back I'll take you cross and there's
[12:16.740 --> 12:19.340]  swims him across and then when they get to the other side the scorpion jumps off
[12:19.340 --> 12:22.980]  stings the frog and the frogs land there in pain dying he says why did you sting
[12:22.980 --> 12:28.980]  me I I helped you and he said well I'm a scorpion BP says seepage near well
[12:28.980 --> 12:35.740]  unrelated so that's a CNBC they're saying it's unrelated to the main well
[12:35.740 --> 12:39.860]  that's so famous have been leaking for 80 plus days so I guess a VP says that it
[12:39.860 --> 12:45.060]  must be true and of course oceanographer John Kessler analyzes
[12:45.060 --> 12:51.460]  methane levels from the oil spill site and says that it is just off the charts
[12:51.460 --> 12:55.540]  one million times higher in some spots the normal concentration that you would
[12:55.540 --> 13:00.900]  find being released by fish and other animals that are decomposing he went on
[13:00.900 --> 13:11.100]  to say oh boy continuing here oil spill threatened by possible tropical system
[13:11.100 --> 13:15.460]  this weekend that could turn into a hurricane a well-developed tropical wave
[13:15.460 --> 13:19.860]  currently bringing strong winds and rough seas north of Puerto Rico could
[13:19.860 --> 13:23.580]  develop into a tropical system by the weekend according to acuweather.com
[13:23.580 --> 13:27.700]  hurricane meteorologists and it goes on there is a high potential for this
[13:27.700 --> 13:34.140]  tropical wave to evolve into a tropical depression later on this week wind shear
[13:34.140 --> 13:37.940]  is currently hindering any tropical storm organization of the system that's
[13:37.940 --> 13:42.780]  good news however this wave moves swiftly west the shear will diminish over the
[13:42.780 --> 13:47.540]  next few days and could turn into a tropical depression and then a hurricane
[13:47.540 --> 13:53.900]  hope but it doesn't happen to hinder the relief effort and also British MP to
[13:53.900 --> 14:02.060]  visit US clouded by BP worries so that is all going on let's look at some
[14:02.060 --> 14:08.660]  financial news now leading Chinese economists urge governments to dump US
[14:08.660 --> 14:13.900]  treasuries by gold this by Steve Watson at prisonplanet.com he links and
[14:13.900 --> 14:18.780]  reports from a Reuters report and some news put up by the Chinese government
[14:18.780 --> 14:25.940]  itself fears re-emerge that China could resort to nuclear option we've also seen
[14:25.940 --> 14:29.540]  the Chinese government in the last two weeks downgrade the dollar and other
[14:29.540 --> 14:34.060]  European currencies as well like the euro prominent economists in China are
[14:34.060 --> 14:36.700]  calling for the government to ditch vast holdings of US treasuries are the
[14:36.700 --> 14:40.700]  biggest holders in the world I would add favoring a tangible asset such as gold
[14:40.700 --> 14:44.860]  a move that would have a far-reaching impact on the economy plus driving up
[14:44.860 --> 14:50.340]  the price of gold Reuters reports that you Yong Ding a former academic
[14:50.340 --> 14:54.020]  advisor to the Chinese Central Bank has appealed the state representatives to
[14:54.020 --> 14:57.820]  move away from US debt and invest in assets dominated and other currencies
[14:57.820 --> 15:01.820]  as well as other financial instruments and real goods although assets and other
[15:01.820 --> 15:05.580]  currencies and forms are not an ideal replacement for US Treasury bonds
[15:05.580 --> 15:09.300]  diversification should be a basic principle you wrote in the Chinese
[15:09.300 --> 15:14.420]  securities journal when demand for US treasuries is strong it is a rare
[15:14.420 --> 15:18.020]  opportunity for us to gradually pull back that way it will not have a big
[15:18.020 --> 15:22.260]  impact on prices in China will not suffer too much we sing race for the
[15:22.260 --> 15:27.660]  exits he report I here's one by carton emmo I'm reporting on that video I shot
[15:27.660 --> 15:32.220]  last week where I talked about this could be a road warrior type collapse
[15:32.220 --> 15:38.780]  that's being engineered by design and if we have a great depression level
[15:38.780 --> 15:42.980]  depression which it appears is is is becoming a certainty not not just a
[15:42.980 --> 15:47.140]  possibility we're definitely in a depression but the question is how deep
[15:47.140 --> 15:50.460]  will it get that society could really unravel and curtain emmo's written an
[15:50.460 --> 15:53.780]  excellent article giving a lot of government document mainstream news
[15:53.780 --> 15:58.140]  alternative news data points I mean this thing is just filled with hyperlinks I
[15:58.140 --> 16:01.460]  spent like a 45 minutes this morning just going through a story it was so well
[16:01.460 --> 16:06.140]  written and had so many data points I learned a lot reading it it's got one
[16:06.140 --> 16:09.820]  two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen
[16:09.820 --> 16:13.820]  fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two
[16:13.820 --> 16:17.740]  twenty three twenty four twenty five links backing up everything that Kurt
[16:17.740 --> 16:23.780]  says here and backing up the fact that the vast majority of people that took
[16:23.780 --> 16:30.140]  the info wars dot com poll believe road warrior depression is coming there were
[16:30.140 --> 16:34.700]  just more than six thousand people that took the poll and the vast majority did
[16:34.700 --> 16:39.900]  find that so go to the site and look that up for yourself and read over the
[16:39.900 --> 16:42.660]  issues that we're talking about make the decision for yourself where you think
[16:42.660 --> 16:47.740]  this nation is going and there's another one here from nethercore press
[16:47.740 --> 16:51.340]  economic meltdown the final phase another excellent report we've got linked up
[16:51.340 --> 16:56.580]  on the website here's a story out of Bloomberg housing starts in us decreased
[16:56.580 --> 17:00.380]  the lowest level since October and of course October of last year was the
[17:00.380 --> 17:05.260]  previous low for housing starts here in the nation with housing prices
[17:05.260 --> 17:12.900]  continuing to drop let's now look at what's happening with blagojevich the
[17:12.900 --> 17:17.660]  disgraced illinois governor it has already come out in the trial what two
[17:17.660 --> 17:23.540]  weeks ago that he was shopping for jobs and that he was doing illegal favors for

[25:11.020 --> 25:18.340]  about when it's your kid and the story admits that there there are health risk
[25:18.340 --> 25:21.420]  it's now 20 to 50 times depending on which type of machine there's two
[25:21.420 --> 25:25.860]  different machines one is 20 times worse one is 50 plus times worse more
[25:25.860 --> 25:29.500]  radiation than they had previously said now they admit they are recording your
[25:29.500 --> 25:33.620]  naked body there have been multiple reports about TSA workers that are
[25:33.620 --> 25:38.060]  forced to go through this and their bosses every day go look at your breast
[25:38.060 --> 25:43.860]  look at how small your male member is there's fist fights there's lawsuits
[25:43.860 --> 25:48.660]  there's free counts because you've got a lot of petty control freaks you got a
[25:48.660 --> 25:54.260]  lot of good TSA people I mean I've talked to them most the time now when I fly
[25:54.260 --> 26:00.620]  most the time their fans I mean I've signed autographs now about half the
[26:00.620 --> 26:04.020]  time I go through TSA they're like hey we're getting a union soon we know the
[26:04.020 --> 26:08.020]  truth about 9-11 hey yeah my supervisors a fan too we sign this for my
[26:08.020 --> 26:13.540]  son this is in Austin this is in LA this is all over the country so I'm not
[26:13.540 --> 26:17.300]  just here bashing TSA people a lot of them are veterans and people that don't
[26:17.300 --> 26:19.540]  want to work for the post office you know they're kind of that government type
[26:19.540 --> 26:25.620]  and they want 15 16 bucks an hour I said a 9 bucks an hour in this bad
[26:25.620 --> 26:29.820]  economy they can get at McDonald's and so they're they're going through the
[26:29.820 --> 26:33.380]  procedures and they know it's about an act of submission take your shoes off
[26:33.380 --> 26:38.380]  answer questions let us feel your breast but there's also a lot of perverts and
[26:38.380 --> 26:41.300]  control freaks I mean it's come out a bunch of them been caught being
[26:41.300 --> 26:44.980]  pedophiles or trying to pick women up or saying I'm gonna bust you for drugs
[26:44.980 --> 26:48.380]  even when they don't have drugs if you don't become my quote sex slave or they've
[26:48.380 --> 26:52.540]  had quite a few of them go crazy and say I'm God start running around in the
[26:52.540 --> 26:57.340]  airport one of them taking his clothes off just going completely insane just
[26:57.340 --> 27:01.140]  going completely insane same stuff's happening in England and Canada I mean
[27:01.140 --> 27:06.380]  you get some petty person everybody's worked at a crummy job in high school or
[27:06.380 --> 27:11.700]  college and I've worked at Walmart I've worked at an ice cream shop and you have
[27:11.700 --> 27:15.300]  some weird boss who's been there for ten years it makes three dollars more an
[27:15.300 --> 27:20.180]  hour than you and they just scream at you and yell at you and just relish the
[27:20.180 --> 27:26.100]  petty power that's what tyranny does is it gives all those nobodies who aren't
[27:26.100 --> 27:32.780]  ashamed to dominate people and who enjoy the raw exercise of power an excuse to
[27:32.780 --> 27:36.940]  run your life and now under this corporate tyranny the fact that most of
[27:36.940 --> 27:40.660]  the government is now corporate run and that we have a corporate form of
[27:40.660 --> 27:44.220]  governance coming in I'm gonna cover that after the break now that this is all
[27:44.220 --> 27:49.340]  being admitted this is hellish I mean in the US in Canada at the last G20s
[27:49.340 --> 27:54.740]  they allowed private security forces in plain clothes to grab citizens and put
[27:54.740 --> 28:03.140]  bags over their heads and throw them into cars and then Rob do was there at
[28:03.140 --> 28:09.420]  that military base when he got arrested at the G20 for videotaping and they
[28:09.420 --> 28:14.820]  were when people had begged to go to the urinal to to they had porta-potties in
[28:14.820 --> 28:19.340]  the old armory they would just sit there laughing at people while they went to the
[28:19.340 --> 28:27.540]  bathroom enjoying humiliating someone enjoying the power it's now come up that
[28:27.540 --> 28:34.940]  one of the deputy heads of the housing and urban development who was also an
[28:34.940 --> 28:41.620]  NAACP chief said look I didn't like this white farmer and I thought he was up at
[28:41.620 --> 28:48.940]  sea and thought he thought he might be racist so I just didn't help him it's
[28:48.940 --> 28:53.900]  that same mindset I mean if I was a white person and worked in that and I
[28:53.900 --> 28:57.220]  went to some black person's farm and they acted like they might not like me I'm
[28:57.220 --> 29:02.580]  too prideful to discriminate against them I'm too prideful to use power to
[29:02.580 --> 29:07.380]  cheat and dominate people it's not even pride it's like a sense of justice I
[29:07.380 --> 29:12.580]  mean I'm too good to even do dirty tricks against my enemies I won't do it but
[29:12.580 --> 29:16.100]  there's so many people that do so you got racist whites abusing black people
[29:16.100 --> 29:19.060]  and now you got a lot of black folks getting in positions of power and
[29:19.060 --> 29:22.700]  they're openly bragging hey I'm gonna I'm gonna oppress me some white people
[29:22.700 --> 29:27.060]  well that turns you into exactly what you claim you've been fighting how on
[29:27.060 --> 29:31.500]  earth could you act like that of course she's had to step down now but but that's
[29:31.500 --> 29:35.180]  coming up the I'm gonna come back and hit these airport body scanners where they
[29:35.180 --> 29:39.560]  make you put your children through it and the good news is USA Today others are
[29:39.560 --> 29:43.460]  reporting there's a huge backlash air traffic's way down because of this and
[29:43.460 --> 29:46.900]  they may be forced to back off if we keep putting pressure on them stay with

[30:15.660 --> 30:19.500]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[30:19.500 --> 30:23.780]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[30:23.780 --> 30:27.940]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[30:27.940 --> 30:32.260]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[30:32.260 --> 30:36.020]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number

[33:33.500 --> 33:41.220]  finish up with the airport body scanner story St. Petersburg times we've been
[33:41.220 --> 33:44.780]  beating the drum for several years against the naked body scanners because
[33:44.780 --> 33:50.820]  almost two years ago they started putting them in in European airports then
[33:50.820 --> 33:57.580]  the head of Homeland Security Cherdov ordered several hundred of them right
[33:57.580 --> 34:03.500]  before Bush left office that's why we knew they were scheduled to start going
[34:03.500 --> 34:09.300]  in in December of January late 2009 early 2010 but they have the underwear
[34:09.300 --> 34:13.740]  bombing and said oh my gosh we just decided to order these don't worry we
[34:13.740 --> 34:17.780]  just decided to put them in they said that the evening of Christmas day hours
[34:17.780 --> 34:21.420]  after the stage bombing and later came out it was a staged event we covered that
[34:21.420 --> 34:26.380]  in my film police state for the rise of FEMA that the establishment has been
[34:26.380 --> 34:33.500]  busy trying to censor and we knew it had a high level of radiation and was very
[34:33.500 --> 34:37.460]  damaging very close to a chest x-ray from the studies that have been out many
[34:37.460 --> 34:43.380]  years before even in mainstream news we knew that it did record your naked
[34:43.380 --> 34:46.300]  body that's how the government was showing images of the system for
[34:46.300 --> 34:50.180]  demonstration then they started putting them in in England in other areas and
[34:50.180 --> 34:53.340]  they'd have their movie stars go through and the women would print off their
[34:53.340 --> 34:56.940]  naked body and say please sign it for me honey baby and that came out in the
[34:56.940 --> 35:02.340]  news and now they admit yes you're not gonna be able to opt out we're gonna
[35:02.340 --> 35:06.540]  make everyone do it they're trying to pass a Senate bill to make it law and
[35:06.540 --> 35:14.420]  what it really is is a biometric scan 360 of your body for passive scanners that
[35:14.420 --> 35:18.180]  up to in a mile and a half away and by the way that was finally in Wired
[35:18.180 --> 35:23.380]  magazine just last week you guys reprint that about the cameras to look
[35:23.380 --> 35:27.420]  through your clothes at a mile and a half away and these cameras project
[35:27.420 --> 35:33.900]  basically a type of sonar or radar it's akin to it and it's really high power to
[35:33.900 --> 35:38.180]  be able to see through your clothes at a mile and a half away and it just looks
[35:38.180 --> 35:41.980]  right through your clothes and scans and just like you can have a handprint for
[35:41.980 --> 35:46.220]  biometric access and it creates a digital calculation off measurements or off
[35:46.220 --> 35:51.620]  of your face or off of your retina or off of your thumb print I was reading the
[35:51.620 --> 35:55.660]  Pentagon talking about doing this a decade ago so that's how I knew this was
[35:55.660 --> 35:59.580]  the rollout just like I knew they were gonna 15 years ago have license plate
[35:59.580 --> 36:03.900]  readers everywhere everywhere you went tracking you or in 96 I read the
[36:03.900 --> 36:09.060]  telecommunications act that gave first six billion then total nine billion to
[36:09.060 --> 36:13.780]  the phone companies and it described putting entire NSA offices in all the
[36:13.780 --> 36:17.820]  phone companies to wire everything through it so of course I got on air
[36:17.820 --> 36:25.460]  15 years ago and said I guess 14 years ago in 96 and said the phone company
[36:25.460 --> 36:30.780]  isn't tapped by the NSA it is the NSA they're merging with the corporations
[36:30.780 --> 36:35.260]  and the corporations are making money off of this and now what is the big cover
[36:35.260 --> 36:45.740]  story yesterday a hidden world growing beyond control the secret America close
[36:45.740 --> 36:51.340]  to a million secret spies all heavily paid in every position of power and
[36:51.340 --> 36:56.820]  expanding tracking everything you do with the highest security clearances and
[36:56.820 --> 37:00.980]  these people are on power traps and they're given undue trade advantage and
[37:00.980 --> 37:06.940]  and it's the new social class it didn't about being white in America to be the
[37:06.940 --> 37:10.420]  dominant class it's about being a government operative or a corporate
[37:10.420 --> 37:13.260]  slash government operative with government power but that's coming up
[37:13.260 --> 37:20.260]  after calls Steve Watson's coming up the issue here is we can fight back against
[37:20.260 --> 37:25.100]  this this is outrageous this is an act of domination they also have satellites
[37:25.100 --> 37:31.460]  and blimps that get your heat signature your heat biometric signature from the
[37:31.460 --> 37:35.460]  top of your head and your shoulders at close to a hundred percent accuracy
[37:35.460 --> 37:42.500]  they've got that in place but first they need it attached to your name and your
[37:42.500 --> 37:47.220]  license or they'd have to send more than just Google Street View out to take
[37:47.220 --> 37:51.900]  photos of your house and to scan and and and to steal all of your digital
[37:51.900 --> 37:57.900]  internet traffic that's the NSA through Google as their front so when you go to
[37:57.900 --> 38:00.660]  the airport they've got your name it's in the database they put you in the
[38:00.660 --> 38:06.740]  scanner it goes around gets a scan of your body they've got your number now
[38:06.740 --> 38:11.340]  they've got a biometric scan of your body these body scanners are biometric
[38:11.340 --> 38:14.900]  readers just like when you go to get a driver's license under the real ID act
[38:14.900 --> 38:19.860]  which is a national ID card and again I told you that 14 years ago my first film
[38:19.860 --> 38:27.660]  13 years ago America destroyed by design goes over all of that from the
[38:27.660 --> 38:33.220]  executive order when you put your thumb on it's now on the database so now the
[38:33.220 --> 38:36.180]  cops can pull you over and I told you they start pulling you over making you
[38:36.180 --> 38:42.980]  thumbprint it's a federal database slash international database so you're being
[38:42.980 --> 38:48.020]  enrolled in the grid here's another one Tara Hertz detectors could see through
[38:48.020 --> 38:52.580]  your clothes from a mile away and the intel I've got is it's actually many
[38:52.580 --> 38:57.220]  more than just a mile but there it is
[39:00.140 --> 39:05.460]  so will you submit will you let them put your five-year-old daughter or son
[39:05.460 --> 39:11.540]  or your 10-year-old daughter or son or your wife in there and the first time I
[39:11.540 --> 39:20.380]  saw this was 12 years ago a clothing company that sells higher you know higher
[39:20.380 --> 39:26.900]  quality clothes to a rich clientele products I saw it in the Washington Post
[39:26.900 --> 39:34.700]  in 1998 we made a big deal about this on air at the time that it was a biometric
[39:34.700 --> 39:39.340]  body scanner that scanned your body for fitting clothes and then I did more
[39:39.340 --> 39:43.660]  research and found out it was basically a Pentagon front that was basically
[39:43.660 --> 39:50.500]  giving the machines free to companies fact search into the term body scan body
[39:50.500 --> 39:59.180]  scanners at for fitting clothing or a new way to fit clothing body scan again
[39:59.180 --> 40:04.300]  they roll all this out as it's stylish and cool how do they roll out in Spain
[40:04.300 --> 40:11.120]  in the United States and in England and Japan how do they roll out chips and
[40:11.120 --> 40:14.620]  planted in your body you want to go to the Baja Beach Club you want to go to
[40:14.620 --> 40:19.540]  the VIP champagne room with the girls in bikinis you want to get free your pass
[40:19.540 --> 40:25.020]  when it's $50 cover all you do is do a one-time $100 fee to be implanted with a
[40:25.020 --> 40:32.860]  chip and all the girls have got the chip and it's so much fun they found some
[40:32.860 --> 40:36.660]  article but that's not the one I remember is that talking about body scan
[40:36.660 --> 40:42.540]  technology yes it says body scan technology will help apparel firms
[40:42.540 --> 40:50.820]  improve the fit of their mass-produced clothing by providing valuable measurement
[40:50.820 --> 40:57.340]  data on consumer trying to read it from 10 feet away population so see oh you
[40:57.340 --> 41:03.540]  want to buy this online once your body scan is stored your wife or you or
[41:03.540 --> 41:08.300]  whoever can get the perfect size belt the perfect size dress the perfect suit
[41:08.300 --> 41:12.940]  and only the richest will have the perfectly tailored suit to their body
[41:12.940 --> 41:18.860]  scan see there I mean I that's from 12 years ago we were able to pull it up for
[41:18.860 --> 41:24.220]  you right there we're not making any of this up this is a total beast grid of
[41:24.220 --> 41:31.020]  control in fact Amazon announced today that they are now selling more Kindle
[41:31.020 --> 41:37.660]  downloads of e-books they've passed that Rubicon more digital books than paper
[41:37.660 --> 41:43.900]  books the problem of that is in the future they can basically change digital
[41:43.900 --> 41:49.260]  books simultaneously and edit things and put them into the memory hole and not
[41:49.260 --> 41:53.740]  have physical copies of books so it's very very dangerous I'm all for e-books
[41:53.740 --> 41:57.780]  but the fact that it's being phased out as dangerous and it's gonna be the same
[41:57.780 --> 42:02.020]  thing with clothing lines you're not gonna be able in the near future and I
[42:02.020 --> 42:09.380]  mean within a decade to go into most stores and buy new clothes it's going
[42:09.380 --> 42:14.620]  to all be online and you're going to go online and shop because clothes are all
[42:14.620 --> 42:20.660]  gonna be individually fitted you watch just like within three years more than
[42:20.660 --> 42:25.580]  half the Air Force will be unmanned half of their aircraft and they plan by
[42:25.580 --> 42:30.580]  2025 to have no aircraft but troop carriers and maintenance carrying
[42:30.580 --> 42:35.700]  aircraft or aircraft that deliver tanks things like that the entire fighting
[42:35.700 --> 42:40.060]  force of attack aircraft and bombers will be robotic because humans can't
[42:40.060 --> 42:43.700]  take the G's that a robotic plane can have and that edge against other enemies
[42:43.700 --> 42:47.060]  it's going to be unstoppable the point is then that allows globalist to pre
[42:47.060 --> 42:52.660]  program everything individually and now compartmentalize the population in the
[42:52.660 --> 42:56.900]  government in the corporate structure in the military even more where a people
[42:56.900 --> 43:00.180]  don't know what's going on and they can be lied to more easily and be the
[43:00.180 --> 43:05.660]  globalist can launch entire robotic false flag attacks and blame it on
[43:05.660 --> 43:10.220]  whoever they want they can shut the web off and claim enemies did it they can
[43:10.220 --> 43:17.220]  send in a Saudi of 3,000 drone bombers to attack any country they want and all
[43:17.220 --> 43:21.180]  they've got to have is the robotic assembly lines at the air bases to
[43:21.180 --> 43:26.060]  reload the aircraft and fuel them and simply have technicians there to make
[43:26.060 --> 43:31.180]  sure all the computers are working so they might need 120th that's some of the
[43:31.180 --> 43:35.260]  Pentagon estimates I've seen but you don't believe me just search anything I
[43:35.260 --> 43:41.300]  say because all humans are biological computers I'm a biological computer my
[43:41.300 --> 43:44.900]  brain is pretty well-trained to semi-photographic and so you can just
[43:44.900 --> 43:48.700]  take anything I say and search it and find it for yourself
[43:50.300 --> 43:57.500]  120th of the force they need and they'll just be disconnected techs in giant
[43:57.500 --> 44:01.780]  hangars in there working on the robotic aircraft and programming the robotic
[44:01.780 --> 44:06.860]  maintenance droids that are in there working on the equipment humans are
[44:06.860 --> 44:14.620]  obsolete that's why 10 years ago in the April issue 2000 of wired magazine why
[44:14.620 --> 44:19.060]  the future doesn't need us bill joy you want to read that article that let's
[44:19.060 --> 44:23.980]  search that for people bill joy why the future doesn't need us and he has a
[44:23.980 --> 44:26.980]  meeting with several hundred top technology leaders and owners and they
[44:26.980 --> 44:30.380]  just said they had a discussion do we kill everybody we don't need them any
[44:30.380 --> 44:35.340]  more or do we give them mindless games and entertainment and the decision is
[44:35.340 --> 44:38.100]  basically soft kill you slowly sterilize you and get rid of your
[44:38.100 --> 44:42.260]  generations that way and in the third world they'll have wars and starvation
[44:42.260 --> 44:45.900]  to get rid of folks but we're just not even meant to be here this whole Google
[44:45.900 --> 44:50.820]  NSA global grid is an extermination grid in their own words and I know you're
[44:50.820 --> 44:55.100]  not gonna listen till it's too late I understand most of you won't some people
[44:55.100 --> 45:00.180]  though we're gonna listen now why the future doesn't need us bill joy it was
[45:00.180 --> 45:06.780]  I write about the date April yep April 2000 that blow that up blow that up for
[45:06.780 --> 45:12.500]  folks so they can see it my little wire fell out here let me plug that back in
[45:12.500 --> 45:17.980]  so I get my audio again but there you have it ladies and gentlemen okay I
[45:17.980 --> 45:21.340]  said I'd take your phone calls and we'll do that till eight after and then Steve
[45:21.340 --> 45:26.300]  Watson's gonna be joining us let's go ahead and talk to Austin listing in
[45:26.300 --> 45:33.420]  New York to 1310 a.m. and Austin good to have you on with us sir
[45:33.420 --> 45:37.580]  it's so unbelievable to get through I've tried so many times and I'm actually
[45:37.580 --> 45:42.100]  glad that you're kind of all over the place with topics today because what I
[45:42.100 --> 45:45.020]  wanted to talk about I wasn't sure if it was gonna be what you'd want to hear
[45:45.020 --> 45:49.820]  today but first I just want to thank you and Watson and and Paul Craig Roberts
[45:49.820 --> 45:52.740]  and all the guys that you have listen Austin I want to thank you but let me
[45:52.740 --> 45:58.260]  be specific maybe once or twice a week I say I want to hear from police that have
[45:58.260 --> 46:02.380]  got intel on evacuations in the Gulf or I'll say I want to hear what you think
[46:02.380 --> 46:06.900]  about a depression I mean if I don't specifically say we're on this topic it's
[46:06.900 --> 46:12.780]  always wide open okay well the reason I called I about a month ago you were
[46:12.780 --> 46:16.180]  talking about the interfacing of different police agencies with the
[46:16.180 --> 46:22.700]  federal government to control population when they have a need and you and you
[46:22.700 --> 46:27.940]  shouted out to law enforcement and military people to call in to kind of
[46:27.940 --> 46:33.620]  add a little bit of of of foundation to the things you were saying and I tried
[46:33.620 --> 46:36.980]  and tried to get in for a couple of days and I couldn't I'm a retired lieutenant
[46:36.980 --> 46:42.820]  from New York State from the correction department and I was the regional
[46:42.820 --> 46:47.180]  training lieutenant for the southern part of New York State that was
[46:47.180 --> 46:52.460]  responsible for the in-service training of a couple thousand staff and I was also
[46:52.460 --> 46:57.140]  very involved in peace officer status training in New York State and also
[46:57.140 --> 47:04.220]  special ops training so I've got a kind of a background in this stuff and when
[47:04.220 --> 47:09.780]  you were talking about what the state is being taught to do by the federal
[47:09.780 --> 47:14.940]  government it all of a sudden clicked things I remembered from my past career
[47:14.940 --> 47:20.220]  like back in the 70s when I was working for the correction department they had a
[47:20.220 --> 47:24.900]  riot you're sure you heard of the Attica riot yes and the correction
[47:24.900 --> 47:29.100]  department decided to have what they call a correction emergency response team
[47:29.100 --> 47:35.500]  kind of like corrections version of spot to deal with prison disturbances and it
[47:35.500 --> 47:39.940]  was at a time of fiscal crisis in New York State we weren't getting raises no
[47:39.940 --> 47:42.900]  like kind of stuff they had no money and yet we were buying all this equipment
[47:42.900 --> 47:50.140]  I remember us guys asking like how do we afford this stuff and yet we can't run
[47:50.140 --> 47:54.940]  our prisons and we have to save paper clips oh it's federal money and I'm
[47:54.940 --> 48:02.020]  like federal money being used to buy equipment for state correction response
[48:02.020 --> 48:07.020]  teams and I remember one of my supervisors telling me yeah well the
[48:07.020 --> 48:13.220]  agreement is that in time of need we will interface during civil disrupt
[48:13.220 --> 48:17.420]  disruptions with the federal government because they've agreed to buy us all
[48:17.420 --> 48:22.100]  this neat stuff and again they take money from the state they send it back
[48:22.100 --> 48:25.860]  and they make the state dependent on the fed that's why the feds lobbied at the
[48:25.860 --> 48:30.700]  state legislatures in the last 20 years to where when state sees drug money a
[48:30.700 --> 48:35.100]  state or local agency they don't get to keep any of it but if you give it to the
[48:35.100 --> 48:42.180]  feds the states get 85% back making you always do drug raids under federal
[48:42.180 --> 48:47.660]  control everything to destroy states and local control go ahead and I and I and
[48:47.660 --> 48:52.620]  I watched guys I mean like I said I worked for I worked for like 30 plus
[48:52.620 --> 48:57.180]  years for the for the state so I I saw a lot of stuff and I I met a lot of guys
[48:57.180 --> 49:02.260]  and I just paid attention and I remember thinking to myself this stuff isn't
[49:02.260 --> 49:06.620]  legit you know it's just something not that not right about all this stuff and
[49:06.620 --> 49:11.980]  and I you know one thing that happened to a couple of actually almost 20 years
[49:11.980 --> 49:16.380]  after that you remember the Woodstock concert yes well they had a 25th
[49:16.380 --> 49:20.980]  anniversary concert at Woodstock in New York State I remember the budget
[49:20.980 --> 49:25.700]  anarchist burn stuff right well what happened before it was really funny was
[49:25.700 --> 49:30.500]  CMO which is the state emergency management organization New York state
[49:30.500 --> 49:35.900]  version of FEMA set up this command center and I at the time I was a
[49:35.900 --> 49:39.940]  sergeant I hadn't been promoted to lieutenant yet I got tapped to sit in
[49:39.940 --> 49:46.260]  this command post to just be ready for whatever they're in this big concert
[49:46.260 --> 49:50.060]  because they knew there was going to be lots and lots of people and it was
[49:50.060 --> 49:55.180]  unbelievable they had federal agencies civil air patrol was there and they had
[49:55.180 --> 50:01.780]  set up this scenario that they fortunately never had to use in one of
[50:01.780 --> 50:07.300]  the maximum security prisons in New York they had set up a staging area in the
[50:07.300 --> 50:13.260]  back recreation yard using military surplus cuts blankets and pillows where
[50:13.260 --> 50:19.060]  if they needed to arrest mass numbers of people they were going to be able to take
[50:19.060 --> 50:24.700]  them to the rear recreation yard of a New York State prison to house them and
[50:24.700 --> 50:29.140]  red really that's a compartmentalized concentration camp drill and then
[50:29.140 --> 50:32.300]  evidence later came out but you say you were there that those were provocateur
[50:32.300 --> 50:36.060]  anarchists that set the few fires stay there I want to come back to you I know
[50:36.060 --> 50:41.860]  we got a lot of their callers but this is key information and now at the G20 in
[50:41.860 --> 50:47.420]  the US England Canada it's the same they hire provocateurs that the rest of the
[50:47.420 --> 50:51.980]  police don't know are provocateurs to sell the media the police everyone that
[50:51.980 --> 50:57.340]  citizens have to be arrested and whether it was the RNC in 2004 or other

[54:38.020 --> 54:43.100]  Illinois and California New York state calling for quote martial law same
[54:43.100 --> 54:48.220]  thing in Wisconsin it's all exposed in my film the Obama deception it is

[55:03.260 --> 55:08.420]  it basically covers the most up-to-date info is follow the Republic this is part
[55:08.420 --> 55:11.900]  to the Obama deception they're all available at info wars.com on the
[55:11.900 --> 55:16.940]  online shopping cart and this is complex stuff this is a long-term strategic
[55:16.940 --> 55:21.660]  takeover it took me deep research to figure out that Google wasn't just with
[55:21.660 --> 55:25.500]  the government it is the government but a corporate government taking over now
[55:25.500 --> 55:28.620]  it's mainstream news in the Washington Post because they're just thrown at your
[55:28.620 --> 55:34.260]  face and we need to warn police and military now because I can't tell you
[55:34.260 --> 55:38.620]  how many phone calls how many emails how many people in uniform police officers
[55:38.620 --> 55:46.820]  TSA workers off-duty you know city employees all over the country have said
[55:46.820 --> 55:51.420]  I didn't understand what was going on at work until I saw your film and
[55:51.420 --> 55:55.660]  everything in there I'd already seen but pieces of it how do you know all this
[55:55.660 --> 55:59.300]  well I did the research the globalist have got millions of people working for
[55:59.300 --> 56:02.780]  them so they've got to write up what they're doing they always put it in a
[56:02.780 --> 56:06.740]  palatable way you know they always spin it like it's good but when you know
[56:06.740 --> 56:11.180]  history and then you get the deeper congressional hearings on Rex 84 from the
[56:11.180 --> 56:15.820]  80s that's when we found out the plan total martial law millions of people to
[56:15.820 --> 56:19.500]  be arrested but first they've got a drill everybody so they'll say martial laws
[56:19.500 --> 56:23.380]  coming for the flu that it doesn't happen but you've been drilled to accept it
[56:23.380 --> 56:29.260]  the public's been drilled it's the same thing over and over again it's a slow
[56:29.260 --> 56:33.380]  incremental takeover towards the financial collapse so now we're coming
[56:33.380 --> 56:36.420]  to the wall here we're coming to the cliff we're coming to the end of the
[56:36.420 --> 56:40.580]  road and that's why it's getting so crystal clear Austin and any other
[56:40.580 --> 56:46.100]  info yeah just a couple of quick things Alex I just appreciate you let me come
[56:46.100 --> 56:51.100]  back on one of the things I taught at the correction Academy in Albany New
[56:51.100 --> 56:56.900]  York for years was the code and canon of ethics in law enforcement and I noticed
[56:56.900 --> 57:01.580]  that there was this really weird disconnect that a lot of the people in
[57:01.580 --> 57:07.380]  my training sessions considered ethics not to be an individual thing that it
[57:07.380 --> 57:12.500]  was a department that was responsible for the ethical operation and that the
[57:12.500 --> 57:16.220]  officers as individuals were just supposed to I called it the Eichmann
[57:16.220 --> 57:20.980]  defense I was just following orders you know and as long as they were following
[57:20.980 --> 57:25.500]  orders then they were doing the right thing and I would just reach out and
[57:25.500 --> 57:32.020]  speak to my law enforcement brothers that ethics is individual it is not
[57:32.020 --> 57:41.660]  corporate and the only way that the monster New World Order can win is if
[57:41.660 --> 57:48.260]  everybody steps in line with that's right peace officers were always trained
[57:48.260 --> 57:52.220]  to act individually to follow the Bill of Rights the Constitution to have that
[57:52.220 --> 57:57.500]  code and operate with autonomy but now it's corporatized with the structure
[57:57.500 --> 58:04.780]  where you do what you're told and and and they the the New World Order and the
[58:04.780 --> 58:12.220]  big big takeover cannot be successful without the guys where the tire meets
[58:12.220 --> 58:18.900]  the road and if you will not follow unlawful orders if you realize that
[58:18.900 --> 58:24.700]  ethics is individual and just don't do it they can't win God bless you Austin
[58:24.700 --> 58:28.300]  call back again I'm glad you got through so many great peace officers and
[58:28.300 --> 58:33.180]  guardians of the Republic out there and that's why individuals as citizens
[58:33.180 --> 58:36.980]  have to speak up and say when things are wrong so that police and military and
[58:36.980 --> 58:45.340]  government recognize what they're doing thank you for listening to GCN be sure

[01:00:42.500 --> 01:00:48.220]  talk to ariel in new york ariel you're on the air yes hello alex jones my
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:53.260]  friend called me ar and my friend will he's the one that always told me about
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:57.780]  this your show and told me how to call in and he's always telling me you know my
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:02.660]  friends about high fructose corn syrup I just wanted to just tell me really
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.380]  quickly what's wrong with the high fructose corn syrup because it's in
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:11.780]  everything is in in a ketchup you know it's in everything so let's cover what
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:16.380]  we know 80 plus percent of the corn in this country for the last decade has
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:21.460]  been GMO there's different varieties of it but mainly it's to be pesticide
[01:01:21.460 --> 01:01:25.420]  resistant so it doesn't die when it gets sprayed with pesticides it then
[01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:29.420]  absorbs the pesticides and concentrates in it and in all the studies of these
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:35.380]  GMO corns with rats it kills them it causes organ failure so you've got that
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:42.140]  poison in the corn syrup and government has reported itself that upwards of half
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:46.060]  to a third depending on which batch they test of all major corn syrup
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:51.220]  containing products has high levels of mercury very high levels because they
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:57.860]  also spray toxic waste the leftovers from oil production oil refining whatever
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:03.300]  is left over they call it fertilizer and spray the toxic waste on crops and so
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:08.460]  then plants are very good at absorbing and drawing those heavy metals up out of
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:13.260]  the soil so there's also the scientists report the way corn syrup is
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:17.260]  metabolically absorbed burns out the pancreas but that's the least of your
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:22.340]  problems corn syrup is so devastating because it's filled with mercury and
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:28.780]  it's also filled with the toxins from the GMO and this is just hidden in plain
[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:35.260]  view wow that's just unfortunate and I just have all one final question you
[01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:39.540]  know because I know health is one half of the battle and that's why it's good
[01:02:39.540 --> 01:02:43.460]  I'm glad I noticed how when we say no to aspartame people stop drinking diet
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:46.540]  drinks suddenly they put it in tens of thousands of products and all the major
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:50.540]  sugar guns and you say no to GMO they put it in the corn so it's in the filler
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:53.980]  products and all the foods and it's almost impossible to buy food at the
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:59.100]  grocery store that isn't deadly but it's done by design go ahead yes thanks
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:03.100]  thanks for talking about the aspartame to you know he'll he never mentioned that
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:07.940]  to me always mention the floor and high fructose one of my final question is you
[01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:14.260]  know there's so many people who just don't care about what's happening maybe
[01:03:14.260 --> 01:03:18.900]  until it happens when do you think it will be the time the exact moment for the
[01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:22.340]  people who really don't care about it because you know there's people that do
[01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.380]  care like you and they're taking action now and it is the time to take action
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:30.700]  but for people who are not just there enough when do you think the time will
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:34.820]  come for the for the next wave of people and I mean it's all incremental it's all
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.660]  part of a process and the Bible talks about people being spiritually blind and
[01:03:38.660 --> 01:03:46.060]  not being spiritually enlightened and so what happens is they are deceived and
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:50.100]  they they're given a great delusion and so it doesn't matter if a half the kids
[01:03:50.100 --> 01:03:54.900]  on their block or got cancer you know they just think that's normal and they
[01:03:54.900 --> 01:03:59.780]  they want to care about sitcoms in the New York Yankees and act and cool their
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:03.820]  buddies at the bar it's too heavy for them to believe the government's
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:09.060]  poisoning them and that there's a soft kill operation to sterilize us and so
[01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:15.060]  they're just already immersed in death to the point of they've just given up we
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:22.980]  don't need the majority we need a active aggressive tireless focused minority
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:28.180]  of truth lovers and freedom lovers and life lovers who are willing to tell the
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:37.460]  truth and stand up and speak out so I mean that's the bottom line I appreciate

[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:07.460]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:11.620]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:15.620]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:19.500]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is

[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:54.820]  prisonplanet.com top secret America Google launches cover-up of Google
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:09:02.580]  spies story Google launches cover-up of Google spies story now we said search
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:07.100]  the term yesterday Google spies to link to an article and past articles we
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:12.780]  wrote years ago saying Google was basically an NSA front but a corporate
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:16.380]  government this isn't the government taking over corporations this is the
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:23.060]  government merging with corporations and you know here's one of the stories we
[01:09:23.060 --> 01:09:28.580]  wrote four years ago Paul Watson ex agent CIA seed money helped launch Google
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:33.460]  steel goes further than before and detailing ties names Google CIA liaison
[01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:39.420]  show here's that article from four years ago and why is this so important
[01:09:39.420 --> 01:09:45.180]  here's the article top secret America a hidden world growing beyond control
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:57.460]  854,000 854,000 that's as large as a major city or 1.5 times as many live in
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:03.460]  Washington DC the Washington Post reports with the highest level security
[01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:07.060]  clearance and they're all private corporate operatives that's part of
[01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:13.300]  infraguard as well that's the FBI liaison into this all four parts of the
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:19.980]  Defense Department Army Navy Marines Air Force liaison Dan the FBI state
[01:10:19.980 --> 01:10:23.540]  governments threat fusion centers the license plate reading cameras the
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.020]  cell phones tracking you the Google software listening to you inside your
[01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:30.820]  house with a microphone keyword datting everything Google admits they do that but
[01:10:30.820 --> 01:10:34.220]  say don't worry humans aren't listening computers are listening in your house
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:38.500]  that was four years ago they admitted that headline that starts it Google
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:48.060]  admits microphones on computer listening to you in your home so think of the
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:52.620]  magnitude of this that's why Google it comes out all over the world has their
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:56.580]  little Google trucks white vans going around video taping your street for
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:11:03.020]  screen view that's only the front cover okay now they have GPS coordinates via
[01:11:03.020 --> 01:11:09.500]  the census same thing was done in Europe this is for a real-world 360 map
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:13.060]  similar to cyberspace but in the real world this is what the Pentagon said
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.420]  over a decade ago that's how I knew about this this stuff's all hidden in
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:21.060]  plain view and Google drives around and has put up massed in every major city
[01:11:21.060 --> 01:11:26.420]  that just grab all the wireless digital transmissions from your iPhone your
[01:11:26.420 --> 01:11:32.220]  laptop your wireless I mean I've got an ABC news story where they're charging
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.420]  thousands of people a year now for videotaping police from a hundred yards
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:39.060]  away the cops come and arrest them for eavesdropping wiretapping when there's
[01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:44.180]  no perception of privacy there's no law violated they still charge you and the
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:50.060]  judges tillstell the juries to in to convict you when on its face it's being
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:54.180]  thrown out of court over and over again they don't care so they are gonna let
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:12:00.180]  Google for the NSA go out and steal all the data and the courts just ruled last
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:03.380]  week Google can do that in the US and Australia oh yeah you're allowed to
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:06.660]  steal everybody's data why is Google allowed to do things that nobody else
[01:12:06.660 --> 01:12:11.060]  can why are they allowed to digitize new books and put them on the web and the
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:14.820]  publishers can't stop them because they are the new corporate government so
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:19.380]  good corporations the elite corporations who aren't free market they are
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:24.620]  becoming the government and Steve Watson are an excellent article about this
[01:12:24.620 --> 01:12:30.700]  that the term Google Spies was the hottest search and the hottest search those
[01:12:30.700 --> 01:12:36.540]  are two different terms it was volcanic that's their highest rating and we have
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:40.100]  screenshots of that will put up from his article and because he has the
[01:12:40.100 --> 01:12:44.900]  screenshots in it in his story Top Secret America Google launches cover up
[01:12:44.900 --> 01:12:51.020]  over Google Spies story but I wanted to read this quote from John Quincy Adams
[01:12:51.020 --> 01:13:00.140]  John Adams son courage and perseverance have a magical talisman before
[01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:08.340]  which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air and that is
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.740]  the final statement in this great article written by Andrew Steele it's up
[01:13:12.740 --> 01:13:18.020]  on infowars.com deleted Obama deception movie restored after Google nailed with
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:23.260]  calculated search blitz but the point is Google is now censoring terms that
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:28.740]  expose their spine their search system is a fraud and it's not just to predict
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:32.260]  what's gonna happen in the future by tracking trends but to manipulate the
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:36.620]  outcomes of societal movements they want you to read about Mel Gibson they want
[01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:40.980]  you to read about Lindsay Lohan they want to make you read about Vander
[01:13:40.980 --> 01:13:44.940]  Slute they want to make you be obsessed with the New York Yankees owner dying
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:49.300]  instead of real issues that affect you and your family like the global
[01:13:49.300 --> 01:13:53.060]  depression being engineered by design or private corporations becoming the
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:57.620]  government just a decade ago there were no more than 5,000 people Congress
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:14:01.900]  reports intelligence community maybe 10,000 depending if you look at the
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.580]  intelligence breakdowns differently but a fraction that had this highest level
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:10.980]  security clearance now 800 plus thousand private corporate shills have it let's go
[01:14:10.980 --> 01:14:13.740]  to Steve Watson we'll have him with us till about 45 after then I'll get into
[01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:16.580]  the other news in your calls Steve Watson good to have you here with us
[01:14:16.580 --> 01:14:23.260]  today sir well I tell you we certainly analyze this correctly in the last
[01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:28.060]  decade and and now it's just admitted that Google Oracle and others are at the
[01:14:28.060 --> 01:14:32.740]  very top of this private corporate takeover of the planet your government
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:35.980]  is now transferring most government activities over to these private
[01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:41.140]  operations I mean this is incredible yes I mean it's like you were saying
[01:14:41.140 --> 01:14:48.340]  yesterday it's it's an open secret now and you know people say people link
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:53.300]  try and link Google they say Google has you know extensive links to intelligence
[01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:57.540]  to CIA and NSA but it's like we were saying yesterday it doesn't just have
[01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:07.260]  links it is it has become part of the intelligence apparatus it you know we've
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:11.500]  written we've written articles previously you know multiple articles
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:18.060]  documenting this and I've linked them all today in my article today which is top
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:23.020]  secret America Google launch has covered up of the Google spy story so we've
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:29.020]  taken what's been unfolding in the past few days but we've also contextualized
[01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:35.100]  it with all the previous articles we've written which if you go to this article
[01:15:35.100 --> 01:15:38.060]  they're all linked at the bottom and you can all you can read them and get them
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:43.940]  out to everyone because it's important to understand especially this week with
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:47.820]  the with the Washington Post story coming out it's important to understand
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:52.500]  the relationship that Google not just Google but others you know other
[01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:59.300]  communication companies have because it's part of the overall attack on the
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:05.140]  free internet it's part of it's all linked into the Pentagon the federal
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:10.660]  government the fusion centers everything they're all linked in together and once
[01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:16.700]  you understand how big that is you understand how hard we have to fight
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:23.300]  to keep the free internet so I mean if we just go over if we just go over
[01:16:23.300 --> 01:16:31.500]  Google's links or Google's intrinsic links to the intelligence apparatus from
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:39.380]  these previous articles earlier this year it was revealed that Google was
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:45.100]  specifically had a government arm that works directly with the government and
[01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:50.500]  the intelligence agencies so the public the public side what you know we see as
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:54.940]  the search engines of the street view everything like that that's one side of
[01:16:54.940 --> 01:16:59.980]  it but behind that there's a whole other side of it which is you know
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:06.580]  specifically set up to work with the intelligence apparatus it was revealed
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:14.020]  earlier this year that they were setting up a sort of spy force to work
[01:17:14.020 --> 01:17:20.620]  directly with the NSA and the the pretext that was given for this was that
[01:17:20.620 --> 01:17:30.740]  Google suffered a cyber attack now obviously that was either an excuse for
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:34.900]  the government to come in and say right you've suffered a cyber attack we don't
[01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:39.500]  want America to suffer a cyber attack so we need to work with you behind the
[01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:50.780]  scenes they basically set up a spy force to with the NSA to and if you go to this
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:56.300]  article entitled Google reestablishes relationship with government spies it's
[01:17:56.300 --> 01:18:00.700]  broken down in there and that's a whitewash because they were founded by
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:06.460]  these people and again this allows a select mega technology companies to
[01:18:06.460 --> 01:18:11.700]  control the infrastructure of the web and they are to police the entire
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:16.380]  surveillance grid and they are to decide under cybersecurity who can even have a
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:20.300]  license to be an IT professional everyone under the Cyber Security Act will
[01:18:20.300 --> 01:18:24.460]  be licensed by the government even ISPs that have a hundred or more customers
[01:18:24.460 --> 01:18:30.380]  must be wired through the NSA the FCC saying everything on your computer will
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:35.740]  be controlled by black box software that filters what you can see and tracks
[01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:40.620]  everything you're looking at I mean this makes Chinese style net censorship
[01:18:40.620 --> 01:18:44.980]  look tame in comparison and so they just use the claim that China had kicked
[01:18:44.980 --> 01:18:48.060]  Google out they've now let them back in as the pretext to say oh we're
[01:18:48.060 --> 01:18:54.020]  establishing ties to the NSA when they are in a say software it was created by
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:19:00.820]  the NSA yeah people that previously worked with the CIA and the NSA have
[01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:06.220]  just you know hopped over become leading players at Google in this sort of
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:10.740]  government arm of it this is all detailed in the articles I've linked to
[01:19:10.740 --> 01:19:18.260]  and you got to remember that the NSA was you know publicly out of the the
[01:19:18.260 --> 01:19:23.180]  intelligence agency was monitoring you know everyone's computers and
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:29.060]  telephones and then earlier this year it was just announced that Google was
[01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:35.260]  gonna set up this spy force directly with them so they're just basically you
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:41.500]  know revealing what we already know it's an open secret and we have Google
[01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:47.060]  that owns YouTube leading the Obama deception and then restoring the Obama
[01:19:47.060 --> 01:19:50.980]  deception and then now we have them censoring all these search terms that
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:54.980]  expose them for what they really are which is a huge story let's talk about
[01:19:54.980 --> 01:20:00.220]  that when come back with Steve Watson this is key information straight ahead
[01:20:00.220 --> 01:20:04.260]  question what would you rather drink acidic water which burns holes in your
[01:20:04.260 --> 01:20:08.300]  body and causes loss of bone mass or alkaline water which promotes high
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:12.180]  energy and vibrant health the answer is clear and if you're drinking acidic
[01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:16.540]  water you're helping cancer cells and bacteria to grow out of control alcovision
[01:20:16.540 --> 01:20:21.300]  plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals using
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:25.720]  plasma pH drops is the best way to alkalize your water and help you get
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:29.940]  rid of acid and regain your health and energy simply put 10 drops in the water
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:34.460]  you drink to raise the pH to a healthy alkaline level most experts agree that
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:38.220]  the water you drink should be at a pH level of eight or higher disease
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.020]  organisms like bacteria viruses or cancer cannot survive in an alkaline high
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:47.940]  pH environment order your bottle of alcovision plasma pH drops now by going
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:56.300]  directly to alcovision.com that's alka vision.com or by calling 269 409 1776
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:21:04.380]  again 269 409 1776 the question is where should the American people draw
[01:21:04.380 --> 01:21:10.500]  their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:14.460]  based on a constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob
[01:21:14.460 --> 01:21:18.100]  rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own
[01:21:18.100 --> 01:21:23.060]  our land they think they're on our water children our education our money we
[01:21:23.060 --> 01:21:28.140]  have to define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you
[01:21:28.140 --> 01:21:33.340]  what you did during the Patriot uprising we have the facts we have the

[01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:30.540]  before okay let's go back to Steve Watson Steve shifting gears into our own
[01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:34.820]  little war with Google I noticed yesterday on the top 10 searches we have
[01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:40.380]  screenshots of this the Washington Post top-secret America was one of the top
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:47.820]  Steve can you hear me yep okay great I noticed that top-secret America was one
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:53.300]  of the top searches that was also deleted and if you searched it was nowhere
[01:24:53.300 --> 01:24:57.700]  in there so these could be said cannot be found and they knocked out our top
[01:24:57.700 --> 01:25:05.580]  search Obama spies and so this shows they are actively in there blocking
[01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:10.860]  people finding out about how they're an NSA front yeah and the other thing to
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:17.900]  point out about that is some people have said that well you know your the terms
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:23.180]  are just dropping out but you know there's no there's no way that they're
[01:25:23.180 --> 01:25:28.180]  just dropping out because then if you go to the screenshots which are in my
[01:25:28.180 --> 01:25:32.420]  article today the top article on prison planet take a look at the screenshots in
[01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:37.100]  there it shows you the you know the times where people began to search these
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:44.140]  terms Google spies etc and it shows you the spike in traffic and it's and it
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:50.380]  also shows you all the LinkedIn news articles all the LinkedIn blog posts but
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:55.420]  that's the effect that it has people start picking up on it and people start
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:26:01.740]  writing about it on their blogs and you know this term Google spies which was
[01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:07.420]  linked to the story we wrote yesterday it we asked you know all the listeners and
[01:26:07.420 --> 01:26:11.100]  everyone to search that to get it to the top of the trends chart it went to the
[01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:17.580]  top half an hour later it was nowhere to be seen and if you search for it there
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:23.020]  were no linked news articles there were no linked blog posts which is impossible
[01:26:23.020 --> 01:26:29.220]  because as you can see from the screenshot there were already you know
[01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:36.140]  loads of news articles and blog posts about this story so that means that
[01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:45.500]  somebody who has access to Google trends is going in there knocking out these
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.740]  these search terms that we're asking people to put in to elevate these
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:54.700]  important stories above the other meaningless stuff that's in there and
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:27:01.580]  the fact that the terms that we're asking our listeners and readers to search
[01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:07.300]  are getting up to number one so quickly and as you said the Washington Post
[01:27:07.300 --> 01:27:17.700]  expose which is a two-year investigation into basically it compiles
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:23.380]  everything that we already really know the open secret but that is a that was a
[01:27:23.380 --> 01:27:28.660]  major report that was at number nine when we screenshot it where the the term
[01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:32.740]  Google spy that we asked our listeners and readers to search was at number one
[01:27:32.740 --> 01:27:38.020]  so that shows the effect that this can have the snowball effect you know where
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:43.620]  people are picking it up people are writing about it linking to our original
[01:27:43.620 --> 01:27:52.180]  stories well that's well that's exactly what's happening Steve and today I want
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:55.060]  to do it again I'm not gonna do this all the time and I think it's important
[01:27:55.060 --> 01:27:59.540]  the listeners not spam don't I don't people should use a robot or a system it
[01:27:59.540 --> 01:28:04.060]  just keeps reloading it just yourself you know a few times today because I
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:08.740]  think that's all it takes we have so many listeners go search the term Google
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:15.660]  launches Google launches and then that might make it past their sensors for a
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:21.140]  few more hours as well but Google launches and then that will take them to
[01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:24.940]  the story you've written top secret America Google launches cover-up of
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:33.380]  Google spies story so just search the term Google launches g.o.o. g.l.e. l.a. u.n.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:40.580]  c.h.e.s. if everybody will search the term Google launches and then they'll find
[01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:44.820]  the fact that the story is top secret America Google launches cover-up of
[01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:49.620]  Google spies story then they can see that Google is tied to this top secret
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:53.900]  America corporate takeover this corporate coup d'etat of our entire
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:58.140]  infrastructure and it's an unfair trade advantage as well and so we can really
[01:28:58.140 --> 01:29:01.980]  route these people if we realize that we can we can roll over to their complete
[01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:08.100]  takeover but please search the term everyone Google launches Google
[01:29:08.100 --> 01:29:12.740]  launches and at first it was 20 30 articles on Sunday about this then it
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:17.060]  was a hundred yesterday it's hundreds I mean it's hundreds of articles about the
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:20.940]  Obama deception about their censorship about everything and we're really
[01:29:20.940 --> 01:29:24.900]  showing people what we can do when we take action so everyone and you watch
[01:29:24.900 --> 01:29:29.020]  by the end of the show is gonna be the number one search Google launches
[01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:34.340]  Google launches and they're gonna hate it when it's not Lindsay Lohan they're
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:37.540]  gonna hate it when it's not Mel Gibson they want to keep you focused on stupid

[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:53.060]  I believe in okay going back to Steve Watson Steve yeah I mean I think this
[01:35:53.060 --> 01:35:57.500]  is really showing us though not only how much Google sensors and tries to
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:01.020]  protect themselves and cover up the crimes they're committing spying on
[01:36:01.020 --> 01:36:06.260]  everybody illegally but it also shows how they are protected and it also shows
[01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:13.580]  the power the people have to fight back when they stand up yeah I mean it is
[01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:21.980]  this is the info war this is the epicenter I mean people you know this
[01:36:21.980 --> 01:36:28.900]  this episode has shown that if everyone takes action everyone takes you know it's
[01:36:28.900 --> 01:36:32.700]  not even not even that difficult to search these things if everyone does
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:38.780]  that gets them to the top of these trend charts even if they try and send to them
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:44.940]  even if they do send to them we write stories about them sent to them they
[01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:50.940]  have to send to the stories about us write about you know the censorship so
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:57.180]  this is the info war people have got a you know take on this snowball effect
[01:36:57.180 --> 01:37:01.060]  and run with it well that's a good point the globalist have learned that when we
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:06.940]  win victories against NAFTA highways or surveillance or wars or tyranny that we
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:12.340]  then think we're dumb you know are done and go home but they understand it's a
[01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:16.980]  war they always keep pushing and pressing and never stopping we have to be
[01:37:16.980 --> 01:37:20.740]  the same way this is like a boxing match you don't punch them one time and
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:24.500]  they fall over this has got to be an ongoing rolling with the punches and
[01:37:24.500 --> 01:37:32.580]  whoever wants it most yeah I mean you know we document as how we wrote an
[01:37:32.580 --> 01:37:37.260]  article recently called the lights are going out for the internet and that's
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:42.460]  got you know several links to several articles we've written about all the
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:46.860]  different ways that the internet is being attacked and if you know let's face it
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:54.820]  if we lose the internet half of the battle is lost because it is it is you
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:38:01.500]  know the modern-day equivalent of the printing press it is freedom electronic
[01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:06.260]  freedom you know there's no other way that we can reach as many people as we
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:13.020]  can if we lose it so we've got a we've got to focus on you know fighting this
[01:38:13.020 --> 01:38:20.700]  long war fighting these battles winning these battles but you know the jobs not
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:24.940]  done the jobs never done we can have small victories but they're gonna come
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:30.580]  back and they're gonna throw more at us so we've just got to focus down and keep
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:35.420]  going well that's it Steve resistance is victory and history has shown that and
[01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:39.540]  the globalist built the internet the NSA joked more than 20 years ago they
[01:38:39.540 --> 01:38:45.020]  called it worldwide wiretap that's was their joke what WWW stood for was
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:51.660]  worldwide wiretap and even though it's their grid and their system alternative
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:56.620]  media has now what a year ago in the statistics supplanted and is bigger than
[01:38:56.620 --> 01:39:01.140]  mainstream media and it's only swinging more in our direction so the system the
[01:39:01.140 --> 01:39:04.500]  mainstream media government corporations the top corporations are
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:09.580]  teaming up to not just destroy the web but to destroy the free web and create a
[01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:14.940]  plastic corporate facsimile of it a shadow of it and they're advertising it
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.580]  as trendy and glitzy and internet too but as they've said for 10 years internet
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:23.700]  two meetings they always start the meetings by the internet is dead you
[01:39:23.700 --> 01:39:28.420]  know long live internet too so they get us addicted to the web then they kill the
[01:39:28.420 --> 01:39:32.220]  old web it's kind of like the big bankers come in and put toll roads on
[01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:35.820]  existing roads they're just coming in and taking over our internet right now
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:39.700]  and it's so outrageous if we stand up to speak out against it they're not going
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:42.940]  to get away with it I mean Australia is starting to back off net censorship they
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:46.540]  said for at least a year Italy is starting to back off a bit because the
[01:39:46.540 --> 01:39:50.900]  public isn't going along with it and and none of us need to go along with us
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:56.540]  we need to say no no no and point out what's happening here yeah and it is
[01:39:56.540 --> 01:40:02.660]  big you know it but you said the internet was it was it was started it was
[01:40:02.660 --> 01:40:06.900]  invented by the Pentagon by the military and they now refer to it as the
[01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:12.860]  illegitimate child the one that got away because the people have taken over the
[01:40:12.860 --> 01:40:19.740]  internet and now that they refer to it you know in terms of fighting it as if
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:24.500]  it's you know many several documents they say they're going to fight the net as
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:30.660]  if it's you know weapons system Department of Defense documents that
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:35.100]  we talk about anti-war people pro-second amendment people anti-fellow
[01:40:35.100 --> 01:40:40.260]  reserve we're the enemy that's they're not fighting quote terrorist on the web
[01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:43.500]  they're fighting us and Steve do you agree with me that we're getting very
[01:40:43.500 --> 01:40:47.980]  ripe with their preconditioning for staged false flag attacks on the web
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:51.580]  that these private corporations and government will launch themselves as a
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:56.500]  pretext to shut down the free web as we know it well that's the only way that
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:59.740]  they can keep going with this keep pushing this censorship thing is to
[01:40:59.740 --> 01:41:05.180]  have that pretext to do it but really that it's a two-pronged attack there's
[01:41:05.180 --> 01:41:11.940]  that the cyber terror attack and also the you know the copyright issues which
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:16.780]  they which they use into do this essentially the same thing you know all
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:23.420]  the bills we've got a bill here called the Digital Economy Act where they we
[01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:26.420]  saw already passed the government's talking about repealing it the new
[01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:32.100]  government it's already passed but it's based upon if you or anybody in your
[01:41:32.100 --> 01:41:36.380]  family that uses your internet connection downloads some music or
[01:41:36.380 --> 01:41:41.740]  something or film or whatever that's copyrighted it's the sort of three
[01:41:41.740 --> 01:41:47.460]  strikes and out thing and you've got that you know currently with the Lieberman
[01:41:47.460 --> 01:41:52.360]  thing the kill switch bill so it's a two-pronged attack they've got the
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:58.060]  cyber terrorism thing and the copyright thing so they're gonna keep pushing
[01:41:58.060 --> 01:42:03.220]  both of those agendas to get the censorship to keep the censorship going
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:08.180]  the good news is the Pentagon first designed the internet to be able to
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:11.980]  take a nuclear strike so you can't shut it off and that's why they're just
[01:42:11.980 --> 01:42:15.140]  trying to take it over instead of shutting it off because it's designed
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:20.380]  like a brain to just keep growing new neurons when they try to shut it off and
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:25.020]  now that people have such a hunger for alternative information I think the
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:29.660]  globalists have already lost the battle and they are going to fail if we simply
[01:42:29.660 --> 01:42:34.060]  take action and stand up against them and I know you're about to go out to a
[01:42:34.060 --> 01:42:37.020]  meeting here in a moment Steve but I'm gonna call you during the next break as
[01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:42.060]  I have another huge idea for a story to Mara that we can make the number one
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:45.900]  search that is gonna devastate these people I mean the light bulb just went
[01:42:45.900 --> 01:42:50.580]  on a few minutes ago above my head and we've demonstrated that our ideas are
[01:42:50.580 --> 01:42:53.500]  quite effective here we also use a lot of our great listeners ideas when they
[01:42:53.500 --> 01:42:57.180]  call in with them it was a caller Friday who said I'm sick of Lindsey Lohan and
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:00.900]  Mel Gibson being about the BP oil spill and I said well let's just make the
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:03.780]  Obama deception the number one search it's already the number one video when
[01:43:03.780 --> 01:43:07.300]  you type in the name Obama and we did that we showed people the power but I've
[01:43:07.300 --> 01:43:11.540]  got an idea that is really gonna head them off at the past Steve and so I
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:13.700]  know you're about to go out in about 20 minutes so I'll call you during this
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:16.740]  next break because I don't want to say this idea on air and give the enemy a
[01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:20.660]  heads up but you can write an article tomorrow your brothers on vacations
[01:43:20.660 --> 01:43:24.020]  you're doing double duty Paul Watson Steve Watson or brothers but we really
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:27.660]  appreciate you Steve and your family and all the great work you do
[01:43:27.660 --> 01:43:33.860]  that's no problem so I like the pleasure pleasure having Steve Watson on with the Steve are you
[01:43:33.860 --> 01:43:38.780]  still there yeah Steve Watson does the best Emperor Palpatine imitation I've
[01:43:38.780 --> 01:43:43.540]  ever seen and for some light humor here we got to have that occasionally will you
[01:43:43.540 --> 01:44:01.380]  please give us a Emperor Palpatine imitation everything you've done well
[01:44:01.380 --> 01:44:13.260]  Lord Vader one we hope we hope the cartoon industry doesn't hire you way to do
[01:44:13.260 --> 01:44:21.220]  bad guy voices I'm looking forward to completing your training in time you
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:29.340]  won't call me monster say in time Google will control the entire web in time
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:37.260]  Google better control the entire web man this is good but you know they said two
[01:44:37.260 --> 01:44:41.220]  years ago that Google wants to be the internet in fact I searched that term
[01:44:41.220 --> 01:44:44.820]  Google to become the internet I mean that's really something they're pushing
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:51.060]  and then we know Google is NSA this is amazing in fact as Emperor Google talk
[01:44:51.060 --> 01:44:55.020]  about your surveillance of the little slaves or they had a Facebook calling
[01:44:55.020 --> 01:45:01.900]  his users dumb efforts because they trust him well the head of Facebook he is
[01:45:01.900 --> 01:45:12.180]  he is my servant I have instructed him directly to refer to the users of silly
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:17.980]  little efforts they will all in time call me master all right hey Steve you're

[01:47:07.620 --> 01:47:17.260]  about Cold War SB&R's intrigue book that starred and it was made into a film with
[01:47:17.260 --> 01:47:23.140]  Patrick McGowan from the prisoner so that's what the band's named after you

[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:39.300]  time and the search term for tomorrow I'm gonna well if I just stay on all the
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.540]  talk to you during the break and thank you Steve Watson because I got a big idea
[01:47:43.540 --> 01:47:48.900]  for tomorrow but the idea today is Google launches you search that term send it
[01:47:48.900 --> 01:47:53.220]  to the top Google launches then hundreds of other newspapers magazines web
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:56.660]  blogs will then see us the top search they'll then try to find out what's
[01:47:56.660 --> 01:48:00.900]  happening and write a story about Steve Watson's article top secret America
[01:48:00.900 --> 01:48:07.100]  Google launches cover up of Google spy story see because they blocked out the
[01:48:07.100 --> 01:48:10.300]  word Google spies it was number one yesterday they removed it totally went
[01:48:10.300 --> 01:48:14.860]  back up today removed it totally so now when you search Google launches it will
[01:48:14.860 --> 01:48:19.900]  lead you to Google spies we can play this hopscotch game with them forever
[01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:24.420]  even though they're in there trying to block us now I was having some fun with
[01:48:24.420 --> 01:48:27.900]  Steve there we're gonna come back in the next segment the segment after that and
[01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:34.740]  we're going to talk to Alex Matt Rosa Maria Mojo and Shelly and then eight
[01:48:34.740 --> 01:48:38.100]  minutes after into the hour after that we're gonna be having come up about 15
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.820]  minutes we're going to have Glenn Spencer on he's probably the leading
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:45.820]  researcher that I know on what's happening to our borders the North
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:49.620]  American Union of our country being sacrificed on the altar of globalism
[01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:54.460]  that is all coming up I briefly wanted to remind listeners part two of the
[01:48:54.460 --> 01:48:58.140]  Obama deception is the fall of the Republic fall the Republic the
[01:48:58.140 --> 01:49:02.060]  presidency of Barack H Obama you get the DVD at info wars.com you want the
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:04.980]  highest quality with the extras and to support us or to give it as a gift to
[01:49:04.980 --> 01:49:07.700]  somebody the gift of waking them up people tend to watch it when it's the
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:10.940]  high quality you know DVD cover and things or you're welcome to burn copies
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:13.860]  of it and give it to people like I want you to I'm begging you to air it on
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:19.260]  access television but expanding on that it is part two of the Obama deception
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:22.700]  it's free online it's on change the channel it's got about two million views
[01:49:22.700 --> 01:49:26.740]  there a couple more million views on YouTube millions and millions others
[01:49:26.740 --> 01:49:29.740]  it's probably had about 10 million views total online Obama deception 25 plus
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:34.580]  mill with the different versions so send this link out to everybody to fall of
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:38.620]  the Republic but they're really scared of this because when you type Obama in
[01:49:38.620 --> 01:49:43.820]  it was the number one link Obama deception into Google into Yahoo now
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:47.980]  it's not like that since they took the video down but but let's see if that's
[01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:52.300]  let's see if that's changed now since yesterday it had gone from not being on
[01:49:52.300 --> 01:49:56.020]  the top 10 to being number five once they reinstated it let's see if when you
[01:49:56.020 --> 01:50:06.380]  type in Obama it's risen at the top again Obama see I can do imitations to
[01:50:06.380 --> 01:50:12.660]  that's an Obama supporter and Obama is it you know in his cohorts are like two
[01:50:12.660 --> 01:50:17.340]  giant wolves between some bug-eyed sheep and the sheeps like caressing up to the
[01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:21.540]  leg of the wolf who has saliva dripping he's licking his chops he's about to
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:28.180]  eat them and they're just cozying up like all right I'm out of control ladies
[01:50:28.180 --> 01:50:33.140]  and gentlemen just trying to have some fun here it's so hard to be serious all
[01:50:33.140 --> 01:50:40.420]  the time let's type Obama in and see what happens and no sir it's like link
[01:50:40.420 --> 01:50:44.820]  number five still so they had some victory there you type Obama and it's the
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:48.740]  fifth link I feel not number one so I guess they got what they want to do a
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:52.380]  certain extent you've got to go in online click on that link to the video to
[01:50:52.380 --> 01:50:56.300]  drive it to the top we'll see how they like that we'll be right back with your
[01:50:56.300 --> 01:51:03.500]  phone calls straight ahead stay with us so you think the mass of Gulf oil leak
[01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:08.660]  won't affect the air you breathe think again benzene a toxic gas emitted from

[01:55:22.180 --> 01:55:28.140]  Alex in Connecticut Alex you're on the air hey Alex how are you first of all my
[01:55:28.140 --> 01:55:32.660]  family and I want to thank you for your hard work I just have a couple points I
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:37.100]  would like to make we live in a small town in the northwest corner of
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:41.820]  Connecticut and my sister that's 16 and I go to our nearest towns to post
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:46.900]  stickers articles and posters up and every time we go back to put new
[01:55:46.900 --> 01:55:53.660]  information on everyone takes our stuff down and it's incredible how people are
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:59.180]  so disrespectful ignorant and brainwashed but Alex we're not gonna stop we keep
[01:55:59.180 --> 01:56:05.980]  going every week to put new information up also I just want to point out that
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:12.220]  we've also researched bottled waters like Poland spring CG Pellegrino and they
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:17.020]  all contain fluoride for example if you go to CG's website they state that
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:22.540]  fluoride would increase bone density and now our family and I are buying penta
[01:56:22.540 --> 01:56:28.900]  water that we buy from our local health food store also I have a question for you
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:34.660]  my fiancee and I have a daughter and she's 15 months old and the last time we
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:39.820]  were at the doctor she had told us that we have to bring Gabby to get her blood
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:45.380]  drawn out because of the lead now do you know anything about that I'm a young
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:50.140]  no yeah yeah no I mean I mean they tell the doctors who just follow orders and
[01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:54.500]  most of them are compartmentalized and aren't really that smart that oh you know
[01:56:54.500 --> 01:56:58.060]  we take the baby's blood at birth to test for diseases well why doesn't the
[01:56:58.060 --> 01:57:01.380]  hospital just do it no it's sent to the government and kept in a database that's
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:05.260]  now admitted has nothing to do with a blood test and yes there is a lot of
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:09.340]  levels of lead the government knows it's in the soft drinks the foods it's put
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:13.380]  there by design that's on record and then their answer is oh we got to test
[01:57:13.380 --> 01:57:19.380]  everybody for their blood and they just mandate this stuff but chances are
[01:57:19.380 --> 01:57:23.900]  they're gonna try to test it for marijuana or something and try to you
[01:57:23.900 --> 01:57:27.580]  know take your child they do all sorts of stuff doctors are now indentured
[01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:33.460]  servants of the health department itself a eugenics office of racial hygiene the
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:36.580]  health department was set up for racial hygiene to exterminate people that's
[01:57:36.580 --> 01:57:39.420]  just a historical fact and the average health department person doesn't even
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:45.140]  know they're just compartmentalized to do all of this and so they may be you know
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:49.620]  the you know recommending that test because the doctor really cares she may
[01:57:49.620 --> 01:57:52.500]  not even know that it's being sent off to the health department or it may not
[01:57:52.500 --> 01:57:57.260]  even be being sent off and we know all the blood they take at birth is so
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:03.260]  that's a complex issue but you can find the doctor you choose of your choice and
[01:58:03.260 --> 01:58:05.620]  you know my rule is I don't take my children the doctor unless they're
[01:58:05.620 --> 01:58:08.980]  really sick and none of my children ever had a shot and does that mean there
[01:58:08.980 --> 01:58:15.220]  might be some you know a pathogenic thing they can get I yes but I've weighed
[01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:20.140]  the dangers you know I know what they're putting in the vaccines you know I knew
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:24.260]  the flu shot was a fraud that came out it was so you just can't trust these
[01:58:24.260 --> 01:58:28.740]  people to do anything better eat organic better keep your child away from all
[01:58:28.740 --> 01:58:33.540]  this adulterated government stuff and they will thank you for it I appreciate

[01:58:54.180 --> 01:58:58.020]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[01:58:58.020 --> 01:59:02.300]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:06.580]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[01:59:06.580 --> 01:59:10.940]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[01:59:10.940 --> 01:59:15.020]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[01:59:15.020 --> 01:59:19.580]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:59:19.580 --> 01:59:23.700]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:27.420]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[01:59:27.420 --> 01:59:31.340]  powered generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks
[01:59:31.340 --> 01:59:34.180]  I really believe in the solar powered generators offered by solutions from
[01:59:34.180 --> 01:59:40.220]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[01:59:40.220 --> 01:59:44.860]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to

[02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:12.580]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:20.060]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas

[02:00:26.660 --> 02:00:31.620]  the latest on the generating situation there in the next segment I'll also get
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:36.700]  into this daily finance story California's latest was revolt against smart
[02:00:36.700 --> 02:00:40.580]  electric meters and they were supposed to ask you if you wanted one they don't
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:43.820]  ask they just come and put them on Austin's been getting them they don't
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:47.500]  ask us here and now they admit they're gonna remote control your thermostat and
[02:00:47.500 --> 02:00:51.980]  control what's going on in your house they're telling Fed workers to be urged
[02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:55.740]  to commute travel less then that's gonna be forced on citizens that you're not
[02:00:55.740 --> 02:01:01.300]  allowed to travel or you'll be taxed when you do this is total taxation and an
[02:01:01.300 --> 02:01:04.460]  excuse to surveil everything you do because they got to know when you're
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:08.860]  traveling that's all part of this smart grid that IBM's promoting it's called a
[02:01:08.860 --> 02:01:14.700]  smart prison remember IBM brought you the barcodes on the Jews arms and the
[02:01:14.700 --> 02:01:17.620]  death camps well you'll be getting here soon enough it's called your face scan
[02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:22.740]  your thumbprint all run by these eugenicists IBM's sole goal is eugenics
[02:01:22.740 --> 02:01:28.820]  it is a eugenics trust by mr. Watson okay let's go ahead and take a few phone
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:34.260]  calls here let's talk to Matt and Connecticut Matt you're on the air hey
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:40.740]  sir how you doing I'm good I have an idea to wake people up but first I wanted
[02:01:40.740 --> 02:01:45.140]  to say that I think a lot of people would be interested in hearing the
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:53.140]  broadcast you did on September 11th 2001 you could make that available it is
[02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:57.500]  available you're thinking just search the term Alex Jones on 9-11 it's all over
[02:01:57.500 --> 02:02:04.780]  the web all right and also well with Obama's approval dropping about a point
[02:02:04.780 --> 02:02:11.380]  a week and all these officials saying how they need a new 9-11 I don't see
[02:02:11.380 --> 02:02:15.980]  any way how they won't try and stage another terror attack and blame it on
[02:02:15.980 --> 02:02:20.460]  anti-government extreme and that's right and and their religion is throwing at
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:22.940]  your face because they think you're so stupid so they're just everywhere saying
[02:02:22.940 --> 02:02:25.900]  we need a stage terror attack we need to attack the web we need to blow up
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:29.420]  federal buildings we need a new 9-11 so the public will worship us again and
[02:02:29.420 --> 02:02:32.780]  they're getting ready to do it and then the media will all say oh my gosh the
[02:02:32.780 --> 02:02:37.180]  terrorists did give your rights up the bankers love you go ahead yeah so I
[02:02:37.180 --> 02:02:42.980]  think the plant the seeds ahead of time to call it ahead of time so when it
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:48.580]  actually happens people will be more suspected of the government on top of
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:54.180]  Google launches people need to search Obama needs new 9-11 and have it linked
[02:02:54.180 --> 02:02:58.580]  to that article from a few days ago oh funny funny you'd say something like
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:05.820]  that all in due time my friend all in due time you have done well Matt thank

[02:03:32.780 --> 02:03:36.780]  talk about and one in particular that happened to me personally in regards to
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:40.820]  everything that's going on in our police state and I've watched all your videos
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:46.140]  personally on the 4th of July on Independence Day I was traveling alone
[02:03:46.140 --> 02:03:54.340]  with my my dog who is a licensed service animal he is he was a miniature
[02:03:54.340 --> 02:03:58.100]  pincher of almost eight years old I was coming back from a camping trip our
[02:03:58.100 --> 02:04:01.700]  first camping trip in Sedona Arizona coming back to
[02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:10.060]  Manhattan and I was pulled over by the DPS the Department of Public Safety they
[02:04:10.060 --> 02:04:13.780]  did not tell me why they were pulling me over now I'm about five feet tall 110
[02:04:13.780 --> 02:04:20.620]  pounds absolutely no threat at all they pulled me over and they he told me to

[02:04:27.340 --> 02:04:33.460]  and so what happened got me out of the car I saw my dog Duncan named after
[02:04:33.460 --> 02:04:37.420]  Duncan donuts in in the back seat quietly resting told me to get out of the
[02:04:37.420 --> 02:04:41.540]  car to not turn around and I heard a shotgun click he cocked it from his
[02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:46.460]  vehicle told me to walk backwards kneel down behind the vehicle immediately put
[02:04:46.460 --> 02:04:51.620]  me under arrest never read any Miranda right I was put in the back of a cop car

[02:08:36.260 --> 02:08:54.500]  the answer to nineteen eighty-four
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:01.260]  all right my friends we are back live when spins are coming up here from the
[02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:07.180]  front lines of what's happening in Arizona a lady Rosa Maria called in from
[02:09:07.180 --> 02:09:10.860]  New York for those that just joined us she was describing that she traveled
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:15.220]  from New York to go camping she was driving back she has multiple sclerosis
[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:19.140]  I believe she said she has a service dog that's a miniature pincher those are
[02:09:19.140 --> 02:09:22.740]  pretty sweet dogs the police officer pulled her over bullhorned her out said
[02:09:22.740 --> 02:09:27.460]  get on your knees finish up your story of what happened Rosa Maria at that point
[02:09:27.460 --> 02:09:32.220]  on my knees and they put me into the back of the cruiser and with multiple
[02:09:32.220 --> 02:09:36.940]  sclerosis heat is definitely a factor and it was the fourth of July in the on
[02:09:36.940 --> 02:09:41.180]  the I-17 a lot of traffic is going by watching what's happening as they put
[02:09:41.180 --> 02:09:45.940]  me back in there he went to the to the vehicle which I was driving it was a
[02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:52.540]  rental a car rental he did not explain anything to me and another cop came
[02:09:52.540 --> 02:09:58.500]  opened the door to which my service animal had been sitting closest to he
[02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:03.460]  weighed no more than 15 16 pounds a gentle creature a service animal I
[02:10:03.460 --> 02:10:07.460]  explained I have multiple sclerosis you're violating the ADA I've not heard
[02:10:07.460 --> 02:10:11.220]  my rights I explained I have a service animal he has a vest in the front seat
[02:10:11.220 --> 02:10:17.260]  this is a car rental the forms are in a plain view in the front and what I know
[02:10:17.260 --> 02:10:22.780]  probable cause what happened to the door Duncan walked out calmly until
[02:10:22.780 --> 02:10:28.740]  oncoming traffic and luckily was not hit it was like watching my child he ran
[02:10:28.740 --> 02:10:34.220]  southward they chased him more more came more cops came they chased him northbound
[02:10:34.220 --> 02:10:38.780]  and meanwhile I'm in the back asking for air they had cuss were very tight on me
[02:10:38.780 --> 02:10:44.820]  I was told if I spoke I would be gagged I was it wasn't told I was shouted and
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:50.260]  then Duncan I came back toward the cruiser he is I am his
[02:10:50.260 --> 02:10:54.620]  responsibility he has to come to mama they would not let me open up they were
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:57.500]  not open a window for me to simply whistle and call his name to have him
[02:10:57.500 --> 02:11:02.220]  come now it's all about control and power and it's such a war zone in Arizona
[02:11:02.220 --> 02:11:06.380]  and so many people are being killed in Mexico is collapsing that these type of
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.780]  things happen but but how did and it's terrible because I mean I see the
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:12.940]  reports of where they go to the old woman's house her grandson hadn't lived
[02:11:12.940 --> 02:11:17.780]  there in 18 years they got a drug warrant she puts the little dog in the
[02:11:17.780 --> 02:11:22.220]  bathroom they open the door and shoot the dog I mean it's just craziness it's
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:26.820]  all this macho you know attitude and it's out of control but but I mean how
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:31.380]  did this end the they chased basically they lied to me they said that will come
[02:11:31.380 --> 02:11:38.980]  back they chased him to his death he was hit by traffic on the 17th and I only
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:44.820]  ever I know for him again I had a mess and he was my source of independence
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:51.900]  and on Independence Day was taken from me so why did they pop so sorry Rosa
[02:11:51.900 --> 02:11:56.220]  Maria but why did they say they pulled you over I was not cited for anything I
[02:11:56.220 --> 02:12:01.380]  was told that perhaps I assumed why would I be pulled over perhaps beating I
[02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:08.820]  was going with the flow of traffic and they never cited me and on my the face
[02:12:08.820 --> 02:12:14.420]  book.com slash justice for Duncan smell like Duncan donuts do you and KIN you
[02:12:14.420 --> 02:12:19.460]  can see the photographs of the incredible bruising on both my wrist we're
[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:22.860]  gonna we're gonna put it up we're gonna put it up but just say that again
[02:12:22.860 --> 02:12:27.940]  justice for Duncan yes and that's on facebook.com yes slash justice for
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:34.620]  Duncan do you went KIN I also have a blog spot as well that is that the justice
[02:12:34.620 --> 02:12:41.460]  for Duncan.blogspot.com again Duncan do you and KIN they apologize for getting
[02:12:41.460 --> 02:12:46.740]  your dog you know absolutely nothing no and the first thing I did because I'm
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:50.700]  an intelligent woman I started to take pictures as soon as my I was there for
[02:12:50.700 --> 02:12:55.100]  three hours Alex on the side of the road on the 4th of July screaming they
[02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:58.740]  showed you the boss was they didn't let you whistle for the dog and that's what
[02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:02.620]  matters is that governments your God the good news is in Arizona they've
[02:13:02.620 --> 02:13:05.860]  revolted against the speed cameras are now removing them people are wearing
[02:13:05.860 --> 02:13:09.220]  guns openly and they're saying no to the tyranny and not all police are like
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:12.820]  that but they are very cold and they need some common sense and I'll check
[02:13:12.820 --> 02:13:18.460]  into your story I'm sorry to hear that Rosa I you know there's a little dog a
[02:13:18.460 --> 02:13:21.980]  tiny little dog in fact blow that up for people on screen that are watching on
[02:13:21.980 --> 02:13:26.700]  prisonplanet.tv now let's blow those photos up for people this is just
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:32.660]  outrageous suffering ever since and he was I also have video of our life you
[02:13:32.660 --> 02:13:36.620]  can see our happiness and he really truly I needed nothing with Duncan I
[02:13:36.620 --> 02:13:40.780]  needed him and he needed me and and they took him and he would have been eight
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:46.700]  years old on October 23rd and he was I was looking to move to Arizona to move
[02:13:46.700 --> 02:13:51.540]  I lived in Arizona for almost 10 years and moved to New York to Manhattan and I
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:57.180]  was looking to reestablish myself there for our sake for Duncan and my sake he
[02:13:57.180 --> 02:14:01.460]  was my unconditional love I looked forward to a time we can go back and now
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:06.540]  so don't Arizona there isn't the energy there it's no good and there's no way
[02:14:06.540 --> 02:14:09.940]  I'll go back there unless it is for press well this is this is this is heart
[02:14:09.940 --> 02:14:15.460]  rending and you know we need police stopping criminals not out there
[02:14:15.460 --> 02:14:19.140]  revenue generating but again they're now saying nationwide they're not going to
[02:14:19.140 --> 02:14:22.380]  respond to crime only they're gonna raise money the police are being converted
[02:14:22.380 --> 02:14:26.060]  to tax collectors and good police that ask for help or not being given it God
[02:14:26.060 --> 02:14:30.420]  bless you Rosa Maria I'm sorry to have to know that happened to you it hurts my
[02:14:30.420 --> 02:14:33.980]  heart because I have dogs that I love I have a Chihuahua on a French bulldog and
[02:14:33.980 --> 02:14:37.940]  their members of the family I appreciate Glenn Spencer holding the last five
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:42.140]  minutes while we finished her story but I wanted people to be able to have her
[02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:49.660]  finish up boy I tell you that's a amazing story Glenn yeah it certainly is Glenn
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:52.820]  for those that just joined us you haven't been on in a while we appreciate
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:57.020]  you coming on tell folks about your saga working with Native American tribes
[02:14:57.020 --> 02:15:01.140]  helping folks being run out of LA being in Arizona and and you say things are
[02:15:01.140 --> 02:15:05.540]  really heating up there we've had 17 machine gun in Mexico just two days ago
[02:15:05.540 --> 02:15:11.660]  car bombs going off 40 people dying trying to come in just in one county at
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:16.020]  the corner I mean it is really disintegrating in Mexico is disintegrating
[02:15:16.020 --> 02:15:21.020]  well we know why it is but we've been trying to tell the people why it is we
[02:15:21.020 --> 02:15:26.220]  know what started it we know what caused the drug war to start in Mexico we
[02:15:26.220 --> 02:15:30.980]  know why there was violence we know why people are dying in the desert without
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:36.380]  being saved but of course so many people like you who will give us a platform to
[02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:42.220]  explain to the people what's going on well you've got drones up we're putting
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:45.580]  up some photos you took from drones of just the hundreds of thousands of
[02:15:45.580 --> 02:15:50.140]  illegals pouring across what do they estimate in Arizona alone a year what
[02:15:50.140 --> 02:15:53.580]  is it a half a million illegals come across well probably yeah that's the
[02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:57.220]  that's the total estimate of the number who actually get passed border patrol
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:16:01.900]  and entered the United States through Arizona illegally nobody really knows
[02:16:01.900 --> 02:16:04.340]  because they don't want to know they don't want the people to know what's
[02:16:04.340 --> 02:16:08.700]  going on but but what we've been doing for the last four and a half years is
[02:16:08.700 --> 02:16:14.500]  flying the border from from the Gulf of Mexico right along the border 500 feet
[02:16:14.500 --> 02:16:21.100]  videotaping every inch taking hundreds and thousands of photographs and plotting
[02:16:21.100 --> 02:16:24.020]  where the fence went in and but the important thing we learned and we
[02:16:24.020 --> 02:16:27.740]  didn't know it when we were doing it we didn't realize that the unintended
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:33.300]  result would be that we could then start relating as the fence went in what
[02:16:33.300 --> 02:16:39.140]  happened I used to fly along the border near Yuma Arizona and there is a gold
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:44.180]  water bombing range there that runs right along the border and you can't fly
[02:16:44.180 --> 02:16:48.740]  over it because it has a restricted airspace that goes up to 80,000 feet
[02:16:48.740 --> 02:16:54.580]  but I made a special arrangement with the FAA to allow me to fly in Mexico
[02:16:54.580 --> 02:17:00.980]  along the border I don't think anybody there was on that so we were able to get
[02:17:00.980 --> 02:17:07.980]  starting four years ago detailed records of what that border looked like when
[02:17:07.980 --> 02:17:13.900]  we started out that gold water bombing range was one of the biggest smoke drug
[02:17:13.900 --> 02:17:18.500]  smuggling corridors in the United States if not the largest we have
[02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:22.140]  documented evidence thousands and thousands of tire tracks running right
[02:17:22.140 --> 02:17:26.580]  off of Mexico highway to up to interstate 8 and what happened because of the
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:32.900]  pressure that was put on them they started building a fence in 2006 2005
[02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:39.420]  along across that smuggling corridor and they plugged it they also plugged one
[02:17:39.420 --> 02:17:42.740]  between Yuma and Colectica where all those sand dunes are you see all the
[02:17:42.740 --> 02:17:46.420]  doombuggies out there at night those doombuggies are usually loaded with
[02:17:46.420 --> 02:17:51.380]  drugs that's now been plugged around Douglas and where I live now they plug
[02:17:51.380 --> 02:17:56.740]  the drug corridor but what I I wondered I said look this has had to have an
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:02.020]  impact and this is available on our site American Border Patrol dot com you
[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:06.340]  look school down there and you'll see something that says the fence and the
[02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:12.300]  Mexican drug war you take a look at that and when you walk away you will
[02:18:12.300 --> 02:18:17.180]  realize that it was the fence and vehicle barriers that started the
[02:18:17.180 --> 02:18:22.940]  Mexican drug war that's what triggered it you have this in a little cartel have
[02:18:22.940 --> 02:18:28.620]  a major part of its smuggling corridor cut off and they went to war with the
[02:18:28.620 --> 02:18:33.900]  golf cartels some of the others for access for access and they're still
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:41.980]  fighting over it and it's getting worse and what we're arguing is look this is
[02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:49.060]  what started it if you finish the fence you would end it well that's common sense
[02:18:49.060 --> 02:18:52.300]  and I do think it's a major contributing factor you also have the
[02:18:52.300 --> 02:18:56.620]  government of Mexico cracking down on the cartels I guess to control the money
[02:18:56.620 --> 02:19:02.980]  to launder and that that also why would a government crack down on the cartels
[02:19:02.980 --> 02:19:07.380]  cause them to start telling you to it doesn't make any sense I've studied
[02:19:07.380 --> 02:19:13.020]  this for a year and a half and if you look at all the reports now that
[02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:17.620]  they're coming in for the last two years they're fighting over access to drug
[02:19:17.620 --> 02:19:21.100]  smuggling corridor no that's admitted I think it's one of the main contributing
[02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:24.620]  factors I'm not I'm not disagreeing with you well when we talked to you
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:27.380]  yesterday about getting you on the show you said things are really about to
[02:19:27.380 --> 02:19:30.740]  blow up and we're gonna come back from break I want to get into that with you
[02:19:30.740 --> 02:19:33.540]  and then also talk about the ranchers that have been murdered the homes that

[02:24:22.320 --> 02:24:27.920]  Glenn Spencer is our guest joining us from Arizona Glenn let's talk about how
[02:24:27.920 --> 02:24:34.080]  this has changed Arizona and how the situation has unfolded and what's
[02:24:34.080 --> 02:24:36.840]  happening now that the feds are coming in saying they're gonna try to block the
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:43.360]  state from having any lawn or let me just say this Russell Pierce Senator
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:48.520]  Russell Pierce was the the brains and the political muscle behind the New
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:55.680]  Arizona law AB 1070 Russell the first time I met him two years ago not on who I
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:25:00.000]  was walked up to me at a Chamber of Commerce meeting in Phoenix and I'm
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.120]  not gonna toot my horn but let me tell you something he said you're my hero you
[02:25:04.120 --> 02:25:07.800]  talked about the information that they're getting at the state level of the
[02:25:07.800 --> 02:25:12.520]  American Border Patrol and American Patrol website so unlike the rest of the
[02:25:12.520 --> 02:25:15.760]  country these people in Arizona know what's going on know the government is
[02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:21.800]  deliberately leaving the border open the state is being overwhelmed it's going
[02:25:21.800 --> 02:25:25.320]  broke paying for the services for people who shouldn't be here that the
[02:25:25.320 --> 02:25:29.200]  government wants here the federal government wants here so they finally
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:34.320]  took some action a positive step and many people feel it wasn't strong enough
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:39.400]  but essentially is an implementation of federal law and of course the open
[02:25:39.400 --> 02:25:44.520]  borders advocates and it could have been George Bush or Barack Obama I think the
[02:25:44.520 --> 02:25:48.520]  same thing would have happened they do not want the law enforced I've been at
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:54.280]  this for 18 years I can spend the next 10 hours explaining to you the chapter
[02:25:54.280 --> 02:25:57.920]  inverse how they've defeated any attempt to enforce our laws this is just
[02:25:57.920 --> 02:26:02.480]  another one this is one of hundreds of efforts by the federal government and
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:07.920]  the left to defeat any attempt the Americans make to stop this invasion of
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:13.800]  their country because they know what I said 17 years ago is true you won't know
[02:26:13.800 --> 02:26:19.520]  you're being invaded until you try to stop it they know if we put up resistance
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:24.200]  the backlash in Mexico and from those in the country illegally is going to be
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:32.000]  incredible so it's going to expose the force and a terrific subversive efforts
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:40.120]  put forth by our own government to destroy the United States that's what
[02:26:40.120 --> 02:26:43.560]  frightens them to death because they know if we put them if the resistances
[02:26:43.560 --> 02:26:49.240]  put up it's going to expose the force and that's what it is about to happen
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:56.160]  let's talk about the carnage I mean Arizona one of the lowest crime rates
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:27:01.360]  in history previously in the US now has the highest kidnapping rate and we see
[02:27:01.360 --> 02:27:05.200]  Mexico and I've had anthropologist on to say it is officially a failed state
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:09.280]  and are they just gonna let this failed state collapse into Texas Arizona
[02:27:09.280 --> 02:27:16.120]  Nevada California well that's what they're doing now you have to go back to
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:20.680]  my theory my my hypothesis that that it was that the beginning just the
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:24.320]  beginning of this construction of the fence again putting up resistance you
[02:27:24.320 --> 02:27:30.520]  begin to see the force now if I put if my theory is correct what's happening is
[02:27:30.520 --> 02:27:36.920]  we just disrupted a 20 to 30 billion dollar drug smuggling operation people
[02:27:36.920 --> 02:27:41.440]  owe each other money millions and hundreds of millions of dollars and if
[02:27:41.440 --> 02:27:46.520]  they don't get this load through they owe somebody down at one a lot though $500,000
[02:27:46.520 --> 02:27:50.120]  they're going to kill his family unless they get it so he gets desperate and he
[02:27:50.120 --> 02:27:54.120]  shoots somebody up here some gringo gets in their way it's either him or you
[02:27:54.120 --> 02:27:59.720]  know his family so now what they're doing is they're kidnapping illegal
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:04.480]  aliens because they're a flow of cash flow they don't pay that these smugglers
[02:28:04.480 --> 02:28:08.760]  up front before they cross the border what they do is they go into indentured
[02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:15.360]  slavery and servitude and they pay you a huge interest rate these they have to
[02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:20.100]  pay off this smuggling that these you know coyotes so what they do is they
[02:28:20.100 --> 02:28:24.840]  they kidnap each other's illegal aliens because it's a cash flow for them so
[02:28:24.840 --> 02:28:28.800]  they tell him where to wire the money and it's only and they get uglier because
[02:28:28.800 --> 02:28:33.640]  the drug lords are in serious cash flow trouble so they're going after the
[02:28:33.640 --> 02:28:37.080]  illegal aliens that are trying to smuggle more of them in including
[02:28:37.080 --> 02:28:44.840]  terrorists by the way it is a mess and until we feel that border it's only
[02:28:44.840 --> 02:28:49.280]  going to get worse because these people are getting more desperate as every day
[02:28:49.280 --> 02:28:56.000]  goes by well how is the federal government going to continue congressman
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:29:00.120]  stark three weeks ago said there's no problem in Arizona with the border and
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:05.160]  we've seen senator harry reid say that there are no illegal aliens working in
[02:29:05.160 --> 02:29:10.600]  construction in Nevada you know I was at a town hall meeting with the local
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:15.880]  congresswoman and and Benny Thompson who was the head of the homeland security
[02:29:15.880 --> 02:29:19.560]  committee in the house of representatives and one of the ranchers
[02:29:19.560 --> 02:29:24.600]  there got up and she said I just drove 20 miles of the border and I didn't see
[02:29:24.600 --> 02:29:28.840]  one border patrol agent and she said I talked to commissioner first that he
[02:29:28.840 --> 02:29:33.320]  runs to customs and border protection and he said he told her over the phone
[02:29:33.320 --> 02:29:37.880]  and in a conference call I don't want to call you a liar but that's not what I
[02:29:37.880 --> 02:29:44.360]  told what I am told well I handed this lady a note I have 30 video tape of that
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:49.240]  same 30 miles of the border you can watch it online nobody there stay there
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:53.720]  stay there stay there let's talk about it we're on the march the empires on the

[02:29:59.880 --> 02:30:05.280]  the question is where should the American people draw their line in the
[02:30:05.280 --> 02:30:10.800]  sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a republic is based on the
[02:30:10.800 --> 02:30:15.240]  Constitution which protects minority rights not democracy not mob rule two
[02:30:15.240 --> 02:30:18.280]  wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so they think they own our land
[02:30:18.280 --> 02:30:23.400]  they think they're on our water children our education our money we have to
[02:30:23.400 --> 02:30:28.280]  define who we are and what we will tolerate somebody's gonna ask you what

[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:33.720]  months ago a Mr. Sitaro the fake president said I'm not going to fix that

[02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:45.160]  go through the amnesty route I mean this is how these people come into the
[02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:50.040]  country and we are a nation of immigrants and I'm all for people being
[02:33:50.040 --> 02:33:53.840]  able to come into the nation but we have brown berets another video that
[02:33:53.840 --> 02:33:56.880]  surfaced last night we're gonna play a clip of it coming up here in a few
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:03.000]  minutes where they come out to you know protest against the open borders in
[02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:08.200]  Arizona and California and they say hey white people you're not supposed to be
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:13.320]  here your Europeans go back to Europe and this woman you know looks like she's
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:17.160]  almost completely Spanish I mean she's as European as anybody else and she's
[02:34:17.160 --> 02:34:21.300]  saying go back to Europe you Europeans and the woman looks like she's Spanish
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:24.560]  looks like she has very little Indian blood in her look I don't care if you're
[02:34:24.560 --> 02:34:27.880]  Indian I don't care if you're Spanish I don't care if you're Chinese German
[02:34:27.880 --> 02:34:31.760]  whatever as long as you're not a socialist as long as you're not anti gun in
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:35.560]  fact let's play that short clip and get Glenn Spencer's take on it this was shot
[02:34:35.560 --> 02:35:04.680]  just a few days ago here it is
[02:35:05.560 --> 02:35:21.000]  you can watch the whole video we got it linked on infowars.com and
[02:35:21.000 --> 02:35:25.080]  prisonplanet.com and I've seen the brown berets and other groups in LA famous
[02:35:25.080 --> 02:35:28.520]  video with the image of police with their heads cut off with blonde hair blue
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:33.760]  eyes saying you know kill the gringos and it's just ongoing and I've protested
[02:35:33.760 --> 02:35:38.080]  the Klan and I've protested these groups and they're all big foundation funded
[02:35:38.080 --> 02:35:41.560]  government funded it just comes out over and over again to get us all of each
[02:35:41.560 --> 02:35:45.640]  other's throats but the issue is is this woman not know that Spain is as
[02:35:45.640 --> 02:35:50.000]  European as it gets so the oldest countries in Europe that's who colonized
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:55.640]  Latin America that's Cortez came in and overthrew Montezuma and all of that
[02:35:55.640 --> 02:36:01.520]  craziness that was going on and you know my issue here is that you heard her say
[02:36:01.520 --> 02:36:05.680]  this is Mexico get out of here well there were six flags over Texas there were
[02:36:05.680 --> 02:36:10.040]  four flags over California or five flags it was actually a Russian flag at one
[02:36:10.040 --> 02:36:15.520]  time four flags that have flown over Arizona and so to claim because Mexico
[02:36:15.520 --> 02:36:18.880]  had a few missions there it belongs to Mexico why would people want to leave
[02:36:18.880 --> 02:36:22.080]  Mexico and come here if they want to make this Mexico in that system of
[02:36:22.080 --> 02:36:25.200]  government and then we've got another map I'm gonna put up me at Glenn Spencer's
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:28.520]  comments on this is from American patrol and give you those websites one of the
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:32.880]  best sources for real intel of where many of these border patrol sectors are
[02:36:32.880 --> 02:36:38.680]  over a hundred miles apart look at that one in Southwest Texas that's got to be
[02:36:38.680 --> 02:36:42.160]  more than a hundred miles away from the one in southern New Mexico there's one
[02:36:42.160 --> 02:36:46.920]  for New Mexico there's two for Arizona they're almost 80 miles to a hundred
[02:36:46.920 --> 02:36:53.320]  miles off the border there's one for Nevada two for California and and one
[02:36:53.320 --> 02:36:57.280]  of the biggest citizen complaints is that they're getting harassed that's one
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:36:59.760]  of my problems with what Arizona is doing I support it but that is the
[02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:04.560]  problem that the police and a lot of these sanctuary cities are gonna use us
[02:37:04.560 --> 02:37:07.840]  as an excuse to harass citizens no matter what color they are but that's a
[02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:11.120]  lot of issues I threw out Glenn Spencer first give us your websites and then
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:15.920]  let's get into the Brown Berets American patrol dot com is my personal
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:19.960]  website my blog and then the nonprofit website is American border patrol dot
[02:37:19.960 --> 02:37:25.040]  com I've been up against the Brown Berets for years ten years ago I produced
[02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:29.880]  a documentary called the conquest of Oslo and I here I didn't just quote some
[02:37:29.880 --> 02:37:35.080]  jerk with the Brown Berets I quoted the president of Mexico I quoted the co-founder
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:40.160]  of the Mexican-American legal defense and education fund who said California is
[02:37:40.160 --> 02:37:45.240]  going to be a Hispanic state and anybody who doesn't like it should leave I had I
[02:37:45.240 --> 02:37:50.000]  quoted art tourist then head of the California Democrat Party he said
[02:37:50.000 --> 02:37:54.400]  prop 187 that was the one that tried to stop funding for illegal aliens
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:38:00.560]  California he said that was the last gas before I'd America in California but the
[02:38:00.560 --> 02:38:05.120]  mainstream media ever pick it up no I don't want to tell you know that they
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:08.640]  don't want you to be anybody to know you know three weeks ago the Arizona
[02:38:08.640 --> 02:38:12.960]  Republic want want to produce a map of where the fence is on the border they
[02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:16.800]  produce a great big map but down any tiny little print down at the bottom it
[02:38:16.800 --> 02:38:21.800]  says the source for map intense data American border patrol when the only
[02:38:21.800 --> 02:38:25.160]  organization that has actually gone out and taken pictures and map where the
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:29.200]  fence that you can see it on our website for the only organization that will fly
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:33.480]  along and show you that this deployment of National Guard on the border is a
[02:38:33.480 --> 02:38:38.320]  joke that's a joke and even Bonner the former head of Customs and Border
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:42.520]  Protection said it's a joke but they're gonna make it be a habit or we're
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:49.000]  just it always 1250 National Guard to the border you know that that that will
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:55.320]  give you about 30 lookout stations along the entire border and when they
[02:38:55.320 --> 02:38:59.480]  wanted a dog and pony show with their their National Guard at Yuma when
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:04.040]  president Bush down there they had 14 stations right along the river when he
[02:39:04.040 --> 02:39:08.280]  went there they'll have a total of 30 National Guard lookout spots and they
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:12.360]  show the American people this video and go look the border is secure meanwhile
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:17.960]  it's Wild West they have stacked up along the river almost half of all of
[02:39:17.960 --> 02:39:23.320]  the National Guard that were deployed under Bush were right at the Colorado
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:28.200]  River we have pictures of every one of them it's a joke of the whole thing is
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:33.160]  a joke because the head of Customs and Border Protection person he doesn't even
[02:39:33.160 --> 02:39:39.800]  know where the border patrol is or where they're not they lied to him it is it
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:44.280]  is a lot one of our buddies he has these trail cameras okay and they've been
[02:39:44.280 --> 02:39:48.360]  making a deal out of this and some of it media lately 700 you have pictures of
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:54.840]  700 people going up on one trail in 40 days I flu see a rather
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:59.400]  Fox News he and I and the Fox News reporter went on he showed where it was
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:03.960]  there were a lot all kinds of trails hundreds of them just like it so it is
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:08.480]  it is open there the border patrol is not on the border they're back they're
[02:40:08.480 --> 02:40:13.440]  backstopping they're lying through their teeth they will not enforce the border
[02:40:13.440 --> 02:40:17.040]  they will try to stop anybody who will try well Glenn here's another point we're
[02:40:17.040 --> 02:40:21.800]  always told give our rights up have federalization of police have military
[02:40:21.800 --> 02:40:26.600]  checkpoints do all this inside the country and then meanwhile the border is
[02:40:26.600 --> 02:40:32.160]  still basically wide open absolutely and and and we're not just saying I mean we
[02:40:32.160 --> 02:40:36.240]  knew five years ago as you said Mexico is collapsing now it's officially a failed
[02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:41.080]  state it's totally lawless disintegrating water and I had a state
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:44.760]  senator on one of the leaders of the committee last year he said quietly
[02:40:44.760 --> 02:40:48.920]  martial law has been declared on the Texas border with Homeland Security but
[02:40:48.920 --> 02:40:52.360]  they don't want the public to know that they're worried about Mexico completely
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:56.760]  collapsing into the US and you said this years ago that Mexico was going to
[02:40:56.760 --> 02:41:02.840]  collapse a how did you know that be give us your future trends forecast is one
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:06.680]  of the leading researchers out there on the ground what do you see happening
[02:41:06.680 --> 02:41:11.880]  well what our government is so frightened of is that if they crack down the
[02:41:11.880 --> 02:41:16.240]  border there's going to be complete chaos and there could be a major border
[02:41:16.240 --> 02:41:22.000]  incident and this is a scenario that I see unfolding but to be a major border
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:29.320]  incident especially at El Paso where there's a major shootout and lots of
[02:41:29.320 --> 02:41:35.160]  people killed and then I see of kind of a Rodney King type riot spreading
[02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:41.000]  through places like Los Angeles along the border so well the illegals the
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:44.880]  Mexican mafia is already saying kill Sheriff Babu and others that are trying
[02:41:44.880 --> 02:41:48.680]  to enforce the law so we could see the same type of terrorism and that is
[02:41:48.680 --> 02:41:52.080]  terrorism going on in Mexico if anything's terror where they go and kill
[02:41:52.080 --> 02:41:57.080]  US embassy people it's already happening to send a message right now
[02:41:57.080 --> 02:42:02.280]  that's right and so but but I see this ending up in major civil unrest inside
[02:42:02.280 --> 02:42:09.640]  the United States and and what's the trigger Mexican troops or cartels could
[02:42:09.640 --> 02:42:13.680]  be anything tell a bunch of our police and finally our police kill a bunch of
[02:42:13.680 --> 02:42:20.200]  them and then the war is on well the politically correct people just say
[02:42:20.200 --> 02:42:24.440]  that we're supposed to lay down and die and that this is good and and I it'll
[02:42:24.440 --> 02:42:30.120]  be our fault when the la reconquista in Visora burns down half the country as
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:33.280]  they said you won't you know you're being invaded until you try to stop it
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:37.480]  other people are we are demanding that we secure our borders I just going to
[02:42:37.480 --> 02:42:40.960]  get there is going to be a backlash against that and it's going to be
[02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:45.560]  serious and our government knows it that's why they're so frightened of the
[02:42:45.560 --> 02:42:50.640]  issue it could have been taken care of years ago but they kept putting it off
[02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:55.800]  putting it off delaying the inevitable and now it's going to be much much worse
[02:42:55.800 --> 02:43:00.640]  to clean this thing up well Glenn as the world goes into a depression as crime
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.400]  spikes and the only you know real crop Mexico's got other than drugs and money
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:09.120]  laundering is tourism that's dying right now because the police themselves
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:12.360]  will kidnap you and extort money that was even in the Wall Street Journal
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:18.400]  yesterday so as Mexico sinks into oblivion it's only a matter of time
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.440]  until the refugee numbers even increase higher and and then as our states go
[02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:26.880]  into bankruptcy 46 of them on the verge of bankruptcy according to Bloomberg's
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:31.480]  analysis I mean it's only common sense we've got to protect the country and
[02:43:31.480 --> 02:43:39.480]  and and and and stop this and so I see the depression only exacerbating this
[02:43:39.480 --> 02:43:44.320]  absolutely and believe me Obama will not protect that border if anything he's
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:48.160]  trying to figure out a way to grant both blanket amnesty without going through
[02:43:48.160 --> 02:43:53.360]  Congress you'll give him de facto amnesty by not enforcing the law and
[02:43:53.360 --> 02:44:00.040]  that's why he is is so opposed to the Arizona law because the Arizona law
[02:44:00.040 --> 02:44:04.960]  suggests that there could be immigration reduction illegal immigration
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:09.520]  reduction through attrition in other words people would start leaving and
[02:44:09.520 --> 02:44:13.200]  that's by the way one of the legal arguments that they made against the
[02:44:13.200 --> 02:44:20.080]  Arizona law was that the if it is not the federal government policy to have
[02:44:20.080 --> 02:44:23.840]  illegal immigration reduced through a train well I'll tell you a story last
[02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:28.040]  night I was home at about 6 30 we'd finished dinner and I was there they're
[02:44:28.040 --> 02:44:31.760]  building a house right across the street from me and I was watching a bunch of
[02:44:31.760 --> 02:44:39.560]  illegal aliens that rubber their building and they were done and they were
[02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:43.160]  like arguing with each other and they were running up to the fence that was
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:47.560]  on the back of that house that they're building property and they were cat
[02:44:47.560 --> 02:44:51.560]  calling women that were jogging by and then one of them look crazy and these
[02:44:51.560 --> 02:44:55.440]  guys I mean just 10 years ago illegals didn't look didn't look and act like
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:59.600]  this and I'm seeing it at gas station other places wild-eyed crazy angry and
[02:44:59.600 --> 02:45:03.360]  one guy was walking around with a hammer acting nuts and cars were driving by and
[02:45:03.360 --> 02:45:06.640]  people didn't know what to make of it and it just seems like more and more of the
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:12.920]  illegals have come from Mexico City with 30 million people a running man slash
[02:45:12.920 --> 02:45:17.240]  Blade Runner hell and I feel sorry for these people it's a totally collapsed I
[02:45:17.240 --> 02:45:21.480]  mean it's one of the most hellish city on earth anthropologists unanimously
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:27.320]  agree and it and Mexico's been so lawless now for decades and I think it's a new
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:35.360]  type of immigrant and I mean this is getting scary and and I've been in a
[02:45:35.360 --> 02:45:38.840]  lot of these immigrant neighborhoods when I played football in Dallas and I had
[02:45:38.840 --> 02:45:42.800]  Hispanic friends who lived in you know some of these poorer areas and and and you
[02:45:42.800 --> 02:45:45.600]  know I'd go there to have you know lunch whether we play basketball or wherever
[02:45:45.600 --> 02:45:50.480]  there were nice people and now I drive through these areas and it's I think
[02:45:50.480 --> 02:45:54.840]  through the the the Hispanic rap and the country music they glorify the drug
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:45:59.520]  dealers and the gangster society and I think that MS-13 Mexican mafia thing has
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:03.880]  spread and I mean I was watching these guys and I'm somebody who's not scared
[02:46:03.880 --> 02:46:07.440]  easily and I wasn't scared I felt aggression as I was looking out the
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:11.360]  window these guys look crazy I mean they were wild-eyed I mean they look like
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:16.400]  desperadoes out of a Clint Eastwood movie or I mean it these guys look
[02:46:16.400 --> 02:46:21.160]  crazier and meaner than Tuko in the good the bad and the ugly and I was just
[02:46:21.160 --> 02:46:25.360]  going my god you know we're on earth of these I mean they look wild and they
[02:46:25.360 --> 02:46:28.680]  were again walk around the hammers and arguing with each other and like they
[02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:33.280]  were on PCP or something I mean have you seen this oh I haven't you know it
[02:46:33.280 --> 02:46:36.800]  amazingly enough where I lived here near the border there's so many border
[02:46:36.800 --> 02:46:40.920]  patrol agents that live in this little town is here visited nearby we hardly
[02:46:40.920 --> 02:46:45.560]  have any illegal aliens there are very few Hispanics here we don't have the
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:49.920]  experience that you're seeing there but you know wait these people have been
[02:46:49.920 --> 02:46:57.120]  used for 20 years to being able to walk right into this country and flaunt the
[02:46:57.120 --> 02:47:03.320]  law and thumb their noses and I think they now feel a sort of pressure building
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:07.880]  and they I think they anticipate they look forward that they might say hey
[02:47:07.880 --> 02:47:12.880]  wait a minute we see a change of attitude in the United States and this
[02:47:12.880 --> 02:47:17.280]  could vote very ill for us but that change and I want you to continue isn't
[02:47:17.280 --> 02:47:22.880]  just that we're going into depression I mean the the deal is Americans and I'm
[02:47:22.880 --> 02:47:26.200]  glad to see a lot of Hispanics speaking out against this we see radio stations
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:30.560]  are named the invasion or the race we see air conditioner companies named the
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:35.800]  race we see La Raza and matcha and and and we see the NAACP saying we don't
[02:47:35.800 --> 02:47:40.000]  help you know government officials with the Department of Agriculture we don't
[02:47:40.000 --> 02:47:43.800]  help white people because they're scum I mean and the thing is you've got all
[02:47:43.800 --> 02:47:47.960]  these white yuppies that are guilty and and and and really do want to like
[02:47:47.960 --> 02:47:52.280]  everybody and we're taught to be guilty and who are saying oh and I'm not guilty
[02:47:52.280 --> 02:47:57.880]  anymore I'm not scum I'm not bad and and I'm tired of this and and and really I
[02:47:57.880 --> 02:48:04.200]  think that's what the race crowd has now figured out and I agree with you it's
[02:48:04.200 --> 02:48:08.520]  gonna get nasty very soon Glenn how do you see that being triggered I think any
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:14.960]  number of ways once again you've seen more and more conflict right right
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:22.240]  along the border I could see that being triggered in El Paso or at any place
[02:48:22.240 --> 02:48:28.000]  like Nogales or even the right here at the end of right near me
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:33.880]  Naco they just had a big gang fight just south of my ranch people were killed
[02:48:33.880 --> 02:48:38.200]  and that there was a couple of years ago that they had they shut down the
[02:48:38.200 --> 02:48:43.280]  school here a US school in the US side because they heard a large Mexican gang
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:48.280]  was headed for Naco Arizona well I mean look two months ago and of the six kids
[02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:54.640]  four were Hispanic they were wearing old Navy shirts with an American flag and
[02:48:54.640 --> 02:49:01.520]  on that quasi fake holiday which isn't even Mexican independence and the
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:05.400]  illegals were offended by the American flag I mean I mean this is not gonna
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:09.800]  mix because this is not Chinese immigrants that just want to come here
[02:49:09.800 --> 02:49:13.600]  and live this is not Brazilian immigrants that just want to come here and live we
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:18.520]  don't see the problem there or or people from Costa Rica this isn't people from
[02:49:18.520 --> 02:49:22.840]  Germany or you know people from the African immigrants were not saying
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:26.440]  this Mexico lost wars with the US and they've been taught in those schools
[02:49:26.440 --> 02:49:33.040]  that this belongs to Mexico and it's just so explosive but I wanted to
[02:49:33.040 --> 02:49:38.240]  mention one thing that is very subtle but very significant when you see these
[02:49:38.240 --> 02:49:42.680]  large crowds that are out demonstrating in favor of amnesty and against law
[02:49:42.680 --> 02:49:47.200]  enforcement these to carry Mexican flags they don't do that as much anymore but
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:51.720]  look for something that very few people noticed it most of them are wearing
[02:49:51.720 --> 02:49:58.600]  white shirts to see a sea of white why been told to they have been told to wear
[02:49:58.600 --> 02:50:07.320]  white shirts now what wears a uniform and takes orders an army these people
[02:50:07.320 --> 02:50:11.800]  are subject to in the Spanish language media so much propaganda is so
[02:50:11.800 --> 02:50:16.720]  different the stories that are so different from what we hear you have a
[02:50:16.720 --> 02:50:23.040]  nation divided against itself no the Spanish media because my wife you know
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:28.040]  lived last five years in Madrid so she speaks fluent Spanish and she's always
[02:50:28.040 --> 02:50:31.920]  pointing it out but I mean it's the standard thing is we're taking over the
[02:50:31.920 --> 02:50:35.960]  gringos evil we're gonna bring down America we're communism we're gonna get
[02:50:35.960 --> 02:50:40.520]  the guns and then the average idiot American has no idea this is going on
[02:50:40.520 --> 02:50:44.840]  it's perfect it's a it's a foreign army and then Hispanics who want to be
[02:50:44.840 --> 02:50:48.760]  Americans the great people they're intimidated they call it all the time
[02:50:48.760 --> 02:50:52.400]  they're told no you've got to join the infasora the invasion you've got to

[02:54:27.680 --> 02:54:32.840]  gentlemen we got a few minutes left with Glenn Spencer and you know I live near
[02:54:32.840 --> 02:54:37.920]  the border I live in Texas and I want to live in peace with everybody it's very
[02:54:37.920 --> 02:54:42.360]  simple you look at any child a white child Hispanic child Asian black doesn't
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:46.440]  matter you you love children because they're human beings and then people
[02:54:46.440 --> 02:54:50.320]  grow up to become adults and they get filled with all this propaganda and none
[02:54:50.320 --> 02:54:53.640]  of us are perfect there's a very self-righteous belief that the wealth
[02:54:53.640 --> 02:54:57.800]  of the United States was stolen from Mexico which is not true and that the
[02:54:57.800 --> 02:55:01.480]  United States is pure evil no it's the big corporations the who all are for
[02:55:01.480 --> 02:55:07.320]  open borders that are creating this the so much of our heartache and as we go
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:10.360]  into a depression people are gonna fight over resources I mean seven million
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:13.960]  Americans are estimated by university studies to have starved during the ten
[02:55:13.960 --> 02:55:19.600]  years of the Great Depression and even more in Europe and if we go into a real
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:23.320]  depression we're already going into the beginnings of one it's gonna create
[02:55:23.320 --> 02:55:26.480]  incredible pressure if you got a bunch of self-righteous people you know
[02:55:26.480 --> 02:55:30.120]  listening to Spanish media where it's get the gringo this and that all day long
[02:55:30.120 --> 02:55:33.920]  it is gonna be explosive ladies and gentlemen and the globalists are gonna
[02:55:33.920 --> 02:55:37.520]  come in and restore law and order at the expense of everybody's freedoms and I'm
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:40.720]  against that let's spend so we got about three four minutes left closing
[02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:45.000]  comments on what we've been discussing here well you know on July 14th John
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:48.680]  McCain went on on a record with Greta Susterman he was talking about why
[02:55:48.680 --> 02:55:54.080]  Obama was doing Arizona and he said more and more I am convinced that this is all
[02:55:54.080 --> 02:55:59.320]  about solidifying the Hispanic vote and when you think about it then people came
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:04.080]  on after that it said the same thing now if you think about that wait a minute
[02:56:04.080 --> 02:56:08.320]  but the Obama is suing the state of Arizona because he wants to solidify
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:15.400]  his Hispanic base, 64% of U.S. Hispanic or of Mexican origin so as he believes
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:21.400]  Obama must believe that the vast majority of Hispanics want an open
[02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:26.960]  board now that's the case with that problem well what they're doing is
[02:56:26.960 --> 02:56:32.400]  they're selling the idea I mean it's like headlines against Bob Dole in 96
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:37.000]  women support Clinton more and then other women say well then I support Clinton
[02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:39.800]  I'm not saying Bob Dole was good the point is it's a self-fulfilling
[02:56:39.800 --> 02:56:43.440]  prophecy like everybody knows it's a conspiracy to say there's a new world
[02:56:43.440 --> 02:56:47.160]  order and then weak-minded people hear that and say well I'm not for conspiracy
[02:56:47.160 --> 02:56:51.680]  theories when I've seen Gallup polls up into the high 70s low 80s of Hispanic
[02:56:51.680 --> 02:56:57.320]  Americans that are against open borders I mean I don't know then Obama is wrong
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:01.080]  and and and John McCain is wrong but they mean to be wrong it's part of
[02:57:01.080 --> 02:57:08.240]  globalism they just they just say it's what Hispanics want okay well that
[02:57:08.240 --> 02:57:14.000]  maybe I hope I hope you're right you know that this is something that we need
[02:57:14.000 --> 02:57:18.760]  to take the big to watch very carefully and if it isn't the case I think you
[02:57:18.760 --> 02:57:22.520]  have Hispanic leaders who have an obligation to speak out they know this
[02:57:22.520 --> 02:57:28.160]  is true we're not broke the border but some of the other oh I agree that most
[02:57:28.160 --> 02:57:31.400]  the Hispanic leaders are bought and paid for by the globalist I mean look at
[02:57:31.400 --> 02:57:35.760]  how the fortune 500 funds all this well this is you know these these arguments
[02:57:35.760 --> 02:57:40.920]  are difficult and difficult subject but the one thing that is very simple I'm
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:44.320]  down on the border we have a law that says it's illegal to come into the
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:48.160]  United States and we're not enforcing it and what American border patrol does
[02:57:48.160 --> 02:57:51.720]  on a regular basis is to prove to the American people that the government is
[02:57:51.720 --> 02:57:55.600]  lying to them and then they can make whatever decisions they want to make
[02:57:55.600 --> 02:57:59.400]  regarding their the future of the politicians who represent the bottom
[02:57:59.400 --> 02:58:02.760]  line we're not going to have a country anymore if we decide to let anybody in
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:05.680]  and get rid of our borders and that's what the globalists want you've talked
[02:58:05.680 --> 02:58:09.240]  about how they're sacrificing our country on the altar of globalism that is
[02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:13.000]  correct that's exactly what they're doing and Calderon copied all the other
[02:58:13.000 --> 02:58:17.000]  Mexican presidents and said the Southwest belongs to Mexico they all
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:21.440]  believe that that's it all the polls in Mexico show that that is the case they
[02:58:21.440 --> 02:58:27.360]  believe that well it's just it's just it's just not gonna work I mean it
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:32.320]  you're not gonna merge it third world imploding road warrior society with the
[02:58:32.320 --> 02:58:35.440]  United States but the globalist are trying it Glenn Spencer thank you so
[02:58:35.440 --> 02:58:48.240]  much for your time thank you so much key information coming up info wars.com
