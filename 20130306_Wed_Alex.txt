[01:00.880 --> 01:07.720]  really well-informed perspective on the death of Chavez and I know in America
[01:07.720 --> 01:11.780]  everybody says Chavez but in South America Chavez so I'm that's that's the
[01:11.780 --> 01:15.920]  pronunciation I'm going with but anyway there are a lot of implications for this
[01:15.920 --> 01:21.640]  and there are a lot of parallels to what is happening in America today parallel
[01:21.640 --> 01:27.120]  to what Chavez did to Venezuela since what 1998 so we're going to talk about
[01:27.120 --> 01:32.800]  those parallels and how the American economy is there has been invaded with
[01:32.800 --> 01:37.880]  a cancer in the same way that Chavez his body was invaded with cancer and how
[01:37.880 --> 01:44.120]  socialism is a cancer and in addition to that we got a lot of great guests coming

[06:59.000 --> 07:04.600]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a
[07:04.600 --> 07:08.360]  pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[07:08.360 --> 07:12.440]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[07:12.440 --> 07:15.920]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[07:15.920 --> 07:20.600]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[07:20.600 --> 07:25.120]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy I then
[07:25.120 --> 07:29.920]  searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered

[08:44.920 --> 08:48.880]  video obviously we're going to be covering the death of Chavez here today

[08:58.760 --> 09:05.800]  some in-depth perspective on that issue but as I wrote last night Hugo Chavez
[09:05.800 --> 09:13.320]  even though he is dead the great cancer of socialism continues to spread so this
[09:13.320 --> 09:18.800]  is the the really sad thing not that Chavez is dead that's probably something
[09:18.800 --> 09:22.520]  worthy of a celebration for all who believe in human rights and liberties
[09:22.520 --> 09:28.920]  and and justice in Venezuela the real issue is that his philosophies continue
[09:28.920 --> 09:34.400]  to spread like a cancer tumor and the his philosophies which are of course
[09:34.400 --> 09:39.440]  centralized control total government corruption government taking over
[09:39.440 --> 09:44.160]  private industry no more private ownership of businesses all of this
[09:44.160 --> 09:48.800]  incredible corruption incredible poverty incredible centralized command
[09:48.800 --> 09:54.240]  control economy that philosophy is now invading America well it has been for
[09:54.240 --> 09:57.920]  many years and I will talk about that in more detail here on the show but let me
[09:57.920 --> 10:01.400]  give you the rundown of what's coming up here for the next three hours here on
[10:01.400 --> 10:07.120]  the Alex Jones show we've got Liz Wright zig popping in for a few minutes with an
[10:07.120 --> 10:11.400]  update a live update she's about to give testimony in the state of Maryland on

[10:15.440 --> 10:19.240]  update of what's happening we've got James Stewart popping in from California
[10:19.240 --> 10:24.960]  on his entrepreneurial victory against the state tyranny there they try to shut
[10:24.960 --> 10:29.920]  him down for selling farm fresh milk now this whole show isn't about food by the
[10:29.920 --> 10:34.000]  way but those two just happened to coincide today we've got dr. Len
[10:34.000 --> 10:38.200]  Seputo joining us to talk about GMOs and vaccine damaged babies and how the
[10:38.200 --> 10:43.720]  system wants you to keep injecting your babies with lobotomized lobotomizing
[10:43.720 --> 10:48.480]  heavy metals including mercury and of course there's also MSG and formaldehyde
[10:48.480 --> 10:54.080]  in those vaccines and then in the third hour sort of the bonus round here on the
[10:54.080 --> 10:58.200]  show we've got David Knight joining us at one o'clock with some special reports
[10:58.200 --> 11:04.360]  and also Aaron Dykes jumping in at 1 30 so it's a it's a packed show I'm gonna
[11:04.360 --> 11:10.520]  try to take some calls during the lens of Puto's segment that's at at 12 30
[11:10.520 --> 11:14.840]  Central so I'll open up the phones at that point for some calls but until then
[11:14.840 --> 11:19.280]  we're just gonna run down the breaking news now we're waiting on max to get in
[11:19.280 --> 11:23.960]  here to give us a breakdown on Chavez so I'm gonna save the Hugo Chavez story
[11:23.960 --> 11:28.920]  for later let's go to this story right now which I mentioned before the break
[11:28.920 --> 11:33.520]  but not all stations carry that Paul Joseph Watson has a blockbuster news
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.000]  story on info wars.com media portrays DHS ammo purchases as conspiracy theory
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.840]  this is of course from media matters which is just you know an Obama
[11:44.840 --> 11:49.960]  administration mouthpiece now here's the deal you if you're a regular listener
[11:49.960 --> 11:55.600]  of this show you know that the federal government has purchased over 1.6 billion
[11:55.600 --> 12:00.680]  rounds of ammo their stockpiling ammo like never before it's an arms race it's
[12:00.680 --> 12:05.040]  actually up to 2 billion if you're keeping track and we've shown you the
[12:05.040 --> 12:12.480]  documents from the the bid contracts with the actual numbers right there it's
[12:12.480 --> 12:18.080]  it's it's all out in the open we've shown you that DHS is purchasing 7,000
[12:18.080 --> 12:22.880]  full auto assault rifles as well and it calls them personal defense weapons by
[12:22.880 --> 12:28.080]  the way that's interesting we've shown you and more recently the DHS is
[12:28.080 --> 12:34.280]  retrofitting 2,700 armored vehicles these are really armored assault vehicles
[12:34.280 --> 12:39.640]  they're not tanks but because they don't have a turret but they're armored you
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.800]  know vehicles for moving assault teams around and they are to be deployed in
[12:44.800 --> 12:49.920]  the United States on the streets of America now the the liberal media well
[12:49.920 --> 12:54.480]  I guess liberals even the wrong word it's the it's the radical left media the
[12:54.480 --> 12:59.680]  the White House controlled media says that all of this is made up that it's
[12:59.680 --> 13:03.560]  it's it's a complete conspiracy theory the Associated Press even did a story on
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.600]  this which just said that the bullet buys are a conspiracy or that it's
[13:08.600 --> 13:14.240]  misleading and they don't give any reason why or they say well yeah they're
[13:14.240 --> 13:17.920]  buying the bullets but the government just wants to save money yeah you don't
[13:17.920 --> 13:21.880]  save money buying things that you don't need okay so if they're buying all of
[13:21.880 --> 13:27.400]  this they intend to use it there's a lot of ammo 1.6 billion rounds or 2
[13:27.400 --> 13:32.080]  billion now thousands of assault rifles thousands of assault vehicles and this
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.480]  is just the stuff we know about imagine the stuff that we don't know about but
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.920]  the left says this is all imaginary so as I was joking before before the break
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.560]  there you know wow that that makes our job very simple very easy to prepare
[13:45.560 --> 13:50.080]  since I guess all of this is imaginary we could just to defend against you know
[13:50.080 --> 13:55.200]  imaginary tyranny we could just buy imaginary ballistic vests wouldn't that
[13:55.200 --> 14:00.600]  be great or if you want to grow your own food you could buy imaginary seeds for
[14:00.600 --> 14:05.880]  or how about imaginary food for your food preparedness and I was even thinking
[14:05.880 --> 14:11.960]  I should produce a how to imagine your prepared course how about that how to
[14:11.960 --> 14:17.880]  imagine that you're prepared for anything and it doesn't cost you a dime
[14:17.880 --> 14:22.000]  to gather all this stuff because it's all imaginary and so when the government
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.360]  breaks out it it's imaginary ammo and it's imaginary guns and and comes into
[14:26.360 --> 14:30.000]  your town rolls in with its imaginary assault vehicles you can whip out your
[14:30.000 --> 14:35.720]  imaginary defenses and you can grow food with your imaginary seeds and and after
[14:35.720 --> 14:39.920]  you take the course if a friend asks you are you prepared you can say I imagine I
[14:39.920 --> 14:45.080]  am yes yes indeed I imagine I'm fully prepared against all the imaginary stuff
[14:45.080 --> 14:51.160]  but obviously this is all very real hardware is real bullets are are real
[14:51.160 --> 14:56.360]  lead you know I checked lead is on the table of elements it's actually an
[14:56.360 --> 15:02.360]  element it's it's as physical as it gets in this reality so in fact lead is
[15:02.360 --> 15:06.360]  quite dense and if it's headed your way you don't want to just imagine that
[15:06.360 --> 15:09.560]  that you're moving out of the way you want to get out of the way you want to
[15:09.560 --> 15:15.520]  get prepared so to all of those on the left who are lying to you and saying
[15:15.520 --> 15:22.480]  that this is all imaginary I can only say I hope your imagination continues to
[15:22.480 --> 15:27.960]  work when the bullets are aimed at you you know I because that's where this is
[15:27.960 --> 15:32.680]  all headed and we'll talk about Chavez and we'll talk about Stalin and Mao and
[15:32.680 --> 15:37.400]  Hitler and the history of of tyrants throughout human history who have
[15:37.400 --> 15:41.960]  always inevitably tried to control power and try to dominate their people using
[15:41.960 --> 15:46.360]  weapons weapons that are very real hardware that is very real it is not
[15:46.360 --> 15:51.560]  imaginary it is not delusional it is not a conspiracy theory this is human
[15:51.560 --> 15:58.240]  history repeating itself why is the government arming up it's not my imagination
[15:58.240 --> 16:02.680]  to tell you it's because the government anticipates needing to deploy that
[16:02.680 --> 16:09.680]  hardware on the streets of America there you go God forbid the Associated Press
[16:09.680 --> 16:14.440]  actually would tell the truth and say such a thing anyway check out that
[16:14.440 --> 16:20.800]  story on info wars.com let's go to some other news other breaking news will you
[16:20.800 --> 16:25.760]  be required to turn in your guns to receive health care in America this is
[16:25.760 --> 16:30.920]  a story from yesterday the state rep says that you should that you might have
[16:30.920 --> 16:34.800]  to surrender your guns for Obamacare this is another story by Paul Joseph
[16:34.800 --> 16:40.720]  Watson and let's see what I'm not catching what state he is from Montana
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.840]  here it is Montana lawmaker Creighton Kearns warns that when he's trying to
[16:45.840 --> 16:49.760]  pass a bill that would prevent a health care provider from refusing service to
[16:49.760 --> 16:53.520]  a person who refuses to provide information about their firearms ownership
[16:53.520 --> 16:57.960]  because this is where this is headed someday in the future you go into the
[16:57.960 --> 17:02.160]  hospital you need treatment you had an accident a car accident a broken bone
[17:02.160 --> 17:07.280]  an infection whatever and they say oh yeah we'll treat you but you got to turn
[17:07.280 --> 17:11.840]  in your Ruger you got to turn in your Remington you got to bring your bullets
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.600]  and at that point I guess you could tell them you can just hand over empty air
[17:16.600 --> 17:20.120]  and say here's my imaginary bullets because that's just like Department of
[17:20.120 --> 17:24.080]  Homeland Security it's all imaginary all my guns are imaginary so here they are
[17:24.080 --> 17:29.080]  and then they can then in turn give you imaginary health care which is really
[17:29.080 --> 17:33.480]  what the whole system is because it's not health care it's disease management
[17:33.480 --> 17:38.440]  they give you pharmaceuticals and they get you to think to imagine that you're
[17:38.440 --> 17:42.400]  getting a treatment when in fact you're just being poisoned by the pharmaceuticals
[17:42.400 --> 17:46.840]  think about vaccines are imaginary vaccines because they don't protect you
[17:46.840 --> 17:49.960]  from the flu they don't in fact I've got another story here today about how
[17:49.960 --> 17:56.560]  vaccines cause narcolepsy vaccines are imaginary medicine it's it's like it's
[17:56.560 --> 18:03.320]  it's even more fringe than the skeptics say homeopathy is it's so bizarre anyway
[18:03.320 --> 18:06.360]  there you go if you want health care you might be required to turn your guns
[18:06.360 --> 18:12.160]  check this out Eric Holder drone strikes against Americans on US soil are
[18:12.160 --> 18:18.080]  legal he says this is in response to a query from Kentucky senator Rand Paul of
[18:18.080 --> 18:23.760]  course and in his letter answering senator Paul Eric Holder says that he
[18:23.760 --> 18:28.640]  thinks it's completely legal to have drone strikes against American citizens
[18:28.640 --> 18:35.840]  on US soil and his here's his language he says it is possible I suppose to
[18:35.840 --> 18:40.720]  imagine an extraordinary circumstance here he is imagining again they really
[18:40.720 --> 18:45.120]  love all this imagining don't they to imagine a circumstance in which it
[18:45.120 --> 18:50.440]  would be necessary and appropriate under the Constitution he says what a joke
[18:50.440 --> 18:55.000]  under the Constitution of the United States for the president to authorize
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.480]  the military to use lethal force within the territory of the United States you
[19:01.480 --> 19:09.200]  realize that there are at least five traitorous implications or statements in
[19:09.200 --> 19:14.960]  this in this statement from Eric Holder I mean this is grounds for for being
[19:14.960 --> 19:22.600]  arrested for sedition against America I mean you can't use the military in the
[19:22.600 --> 19:28.600]  United States the president alone cannot declare who to assassinate this is
[19:28.600 --> 19:34.240]  not under the Constitution I mean this guy is off his rocker but he says he's
[19:34.240 --> 19:38.840]  he insists that you can use drone strikes against American citizens on US soil
[19:38.840 --> 19:43.440]  that is now official so all of those who made fun of Alex Jones saying they're
[19:43.440 --> 19:47.080]  gonna use drones to come after you in America all of you media matters and
[19:47.080 --> 19:52.360]  people out there you owe Alex Jones an apology Eric Holder just said Alex Jones
[19:52.360 --> 19:57.440]  was right all right that's a fact it's not my imagination that's a fact stay

[24:16.440 --> 24:22.320]  thank you for joining us here on the Alex Jones show this is Mike Adams
[24:22.320 --> 24:26.720]  filling in today for Alex thank you for continuing with us much more straight
[24:26.720 --> 24:31.960]  ahead I just can't believe that we live in a country where the attorney general
[24:31.960 --> 24:40.000]  who is supposed to be the person who upholds the law the top law defender of
[24:40.000 --> 24:46.960]  the country says that the government with that one man the president can
[24:46.960 --> 24:55.440]  decide to kill an unlimited number of American people on US soil with no due
[24:55.440 --> 25:03.640]  process no charges ever being levied against you no rights no no attorney
[25:03.640 --> 25:09.160]  not even a trial by jury man I mean it's you talk about wow you talk about
[25:09.160 --> 25:15.480]  tyranny this is the very definition of it that the attorney general would say
[25:15.480 --> 25:18.600]  yeah we can kill anybody at any time for any reason and we don't need to tell
[25:18.600 --> 25:23.400]  you why we don't need to produce any evidence why that is is that not the
[25:23.400 --> 25:27.440]  definition of tyranny is that not a total criminal violation of the US
[25:27.440 --> 25:32.800]  Constitution is that not government gone completely awry I mean come on come on
[25:32.800 --> 25:38.400]  wake up people wake up and smell the tyranny in some other news some good
[25:38.400 --> 25:45.000]  news for a change check this out a military acupuncture is a big deal many
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.640]  of you have probably never heard of this but I've been tracking this because of
[25:47.640 --> 25:53.440]  course you know I'm the health ranger I follow alternative health acupuncture
[25:53.440 --> 25:56.760]  you know you know how our soldiers are being killed by all of these SSRIs and
[25:56.760 --> 26:00.480]  all these psychotropic drugs and they're committing suicide in huge numbers
[26:00.480 --> 26:04.320]  and their brains are being fried by these drugs and then they're being they're
[26:04.320 --> 26:09.800]  being diagnosed with PTSD and denied their rights when they come home well
[26:09.800 --> 26:13.760]  there's an alternative to that and it's acupuncture and a process called cupping
[26:13.760 --> 26:18.000]  which is actually part of traditional Chinese medicine cupping where they
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.160]  actually use little vacuum cups and they can pull toxins right out of the body
[26:22.160 --> 26:26.360]  through the skin it turns out that there's a military acupuncture is being
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.760]  tested here in Texas at some military bases and it's being used in a limited
[26:30.760 --> 26:36.640]  room on the battlefield right now and it works that's the amazing thing no side
[26:36.640 --> 26:40.800]  effects no drugs it doesn't cause psychosis it doesn't promote suicides
[26:40.800 --> 26:46.920]  it's it's virtually painless it's easy it's totally safe military acupuncture I
[26:46.920 --> 26:51.760]  want to just encourage you all to to use this term to think about this this is
[26:51.760 --> 26:55.040]  the way to protect our soldiers treat them with medicine that doesn't cause
[26:55.040 --> 27:00.160]  them to commit suicide military acupuncture works and cupping works and
[27:00.160 --> 27:04.120]  there's another angle on all of this because rights of soldiers are being
[27:04.120 --> 27:08.000]  taken away now when they return back to the USA if they've ever been diagnosed
[27:08.000 --> 27:13.720]  with PTSD when soldiers are now facing any kind of counseling or even just
[27:13.720 --> 27:19.920]  talking to a doctor in the field soldiers are now refusing to talk about any
[27:19.920 --> 27:23.640]  symptoms any problems anything at all because they know they're going to be
[27:23.640 --> 27:28.480]  diagnosed with PTSD and stripped of their rights and I don't blame them if I
[27:28.480 --> 27:32.160]  was a soldier out there I would keep my lips sealed as well I'd keep my trap
[27:32.160 --> 27:37.160]  shut and would not say that oh I'm you know whatever they might be feeling out
[27:37.160 --> 27:42.120]  there if they have thoughts of anger or whatever they have or aggression or
[27:42.120 --> 27:44.720]  regret or anything I wouldn't say anything either because they're gonna
[27:44.720 --> 27:48.360]  put that on your record and they're gonna use that to take away your rights
[27:48.360 --> 27:52.240]  your firearms and who knows what else maybe your first amendment right
[27:52.240 --> 27:56.120]  someday so we got to treat our soldiers our active duty soldiers and our
[27:56.120 --> 28:00.640]  veterans better in this country and that means don't drug them up let's use
[28:00.640 --> 28:04.600]  things that actually work like military acupuncture that's something that you
[28:04.600 --> 28:07.480]  probably never heard of but it's it's actually working so let's hope that
[28:07.480 --> 28:11.240]  continues to gain some steam throughout the military all right check this out
[28:11.240 --> 28:16.120]  freedom license plate is banned in Washington DC this is out of the
[28:16.120 --> 28:22.480]  Examiner Washington the word freedom is on the list of banned vanity license
[28:22.480 --> 28:27.280]  plates because you can't have somebody driving around Washington DC with such
[28:27.280 --> 28:35.040]  a such profane obscenity on their car as the word freedom that's not allowed in
[28:35.040 --> 28:40.360]  the capital of this nation can't have the word freedom you also cannot have the
[28:40.360 --> 28:46.600]  word Ron Paul it's also banned according to this article so no freedom there is no
[28:46.600 --> 28:51.360]  freedom in Washington well we already knew that and Ron Paul is banned as a
[28:51.360 --> 28:55.520]  license plate I think we should give that license plate to Ron Paul like the
[28:55.520 --> 28:59.560]  domain name we should give Ron Paul Ron Paul calm I mean come on guys what's
[28:59.560 --> 29:04.440]  going on there give him the freakin domain it's his name give him we should all

[34:31.200 --> 34:35.680]  pregnant women that were sold by that company that got exposed here on on the
[34:35.680 --> 34:39.720]  Alex Jones show well John bound had put those targets into the first person
[34:39.720 --> 34:45.600]  shooter game as if it was really death race 2000 you're getting points for you
[34:45.600 --> 34:49.280]  know bagging women and children and old men which of course is what that movie

[34:57.800 --> 35:03.840]  all graphic geniuses it's quite amazing so anyway be sure to check that out you
[35:03.840 --> 35:09.280]  can join up and see all the video of this at prisonplanet.tv now joining us
[35:09.280 --> 35:15.080]  for just a few minutes a quick update by phone live from the scene of where
[35:15.080 --> 35:20.280]  testimony is being given today in Maryland is Liz Wright-Zig she is of
[35:20.280 --> 35:24.440]  course one of the key leaders on the issue of raw milk freedom she was part
[35:24.440 --> 35:29.840]  of the raw milk freedom writers and has been engaged in a lot of activism on the
[35:29.840 --> 35:34.520]  side of food freedom and and milk choice freedom in America I can't even
[35:34.520 --> 35:39.160]  believe we have to have this conversation but raw milk is continues to be
[35:39.160 --> 35:42.720]  illegal in most states so Liz is joining us today she's about to give
[35:42.720 --> 35:47.440]  testimony Liz welcome to the Alex Jones show thanks so much for having me on
[35:47.440 --> 35:50.760]  it's great to be here oh well thanks for joining us and thanks for keeping me
[35:50.760 --> 35:53.960]  posted and in the loop on all of this you're about to give testimony I've got
[35:53.960 --> 35:57.480]  a copy of it in my hands but give us the breakdown of what's going on there and
[35:57.480 --> 36:04.200]  what are you going to say well basically cow shares which is a valid way for
[36:04.200 --> 36:08.880]  people to obtain raw milk have been criminalized in Maryland for the past
[36:08.880 --> 36:13.880]  seven or eight years and there is a bill in the legislature this session that
[36:13.880 --> 36:17.360]  would repeal that and reinstate cow shares in Maryland and this is such a
[36:17.360 --> 36:21.480]  great option for people like me who live in the suburbs I can't get my own cow
[36:21.480 --> 36:25.560]  but I could get a cow and board it at a friend's farm and then get the milk from
[36:25.560 --> 36:29.240]  that animal so this if this bill goes through this is a great way to revitalize
[36:29.240 --> 36:34.200]  the Maryland rural economies and get raw milk back to Maryland consumers from
[36:34.200 --> 36:38.320]  Maryland farmers well that's that's very important Liz but I gotta ask you how
[36:38.320 --> 36:42.080]  could Maryland have even outlawed cow cow shares in the first place doesn't
[36:42.080 --> 36:45.280]  every human being have the right to engage in a contract you can own a share
[36:45.280 --> 36:48.760]  of a condo you can own a share of a company that's called buying stock how
[36:48.760 --> 36:52.200]  could they have criminalized owning a share of a cow doesn't make any sense
[36:52.200 --> 36:56.160]  yeah well what they did is the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene they
[36:56.160 --> 37:00.960]  changed the definition of sale of raw milk so currently before that sales of
[37:00.960 --> 37:04.960]  raw milk were illegal and they just altered the definition to include cow
[37:04.960 --> 37:10.640]  share arrangements or any animal very animal share arrangement to make that
[37:10.640 --> 37:14.680]  illegal as well they just changed the definition of sales to include those of
[37:14.680 --> 37:20.320]  course a lot of the farmers who would do cow shares are also they also have
[37:20.320 --> 37:25.160]  larger dairies that that sell to co-ops and whatnot so the threat of being shut
[37:25.160 --> 37:28.680]  down and just being destitute financially keeps them from actually
[37:28.680 --> 37:34.240]  engaging in a contractual arrangement known as cow shares so does I assume
[37:34.240 --> 37:39.640]  there's a lot of support for the repeal of that you know very bad ill-conceived
[37:39.640 --> 37:44.800]  law I know you're testifying but tell us about the nature of the support today
[37:44.800 --> 37:49.520]  are there lots of people there to testify with you or what's going on well
[37:49.520 --> 37:53.440]  there are a tremendous number of people in support but unfortunately we are
[37:53.440 --> 37:58.880]  getting hit with our only snowstorm of the entire season today so a lot of
[37:58.880 --> 38:02.120]  people who are planning to be here in person are snowed in and they're
[38:02.120 --> 38:06.320]  submitting their written testimony to the committee they will be heard and it's
[38:06.320 --> 38:09.560]  officially in the record they just won't be here in person well how appropriate
[38:09.560 --> 38:13.760]  since the entire criminalization of raw milk is such a snow job to begin with I
[38:13.760 --> 38:18.160]  guess nature is unfortunately interfering with your your ability to
[38:18.160 --> 38:23.360]  repeal that what when it when is and a decision expected based on all of this
[38:23.360 --> 38:29.120]  testimony well the hearing is today and then usually the committee vote like
[38:29.120 --> 38:33.440]  anywhere from three days to a couple of weeks after the hearing and then if it
[38:33.440 --> 38:37.600]  gets if it gets referred out of committee positively like it's enough
[38:37.600 --> 38:42.840]  members vote yes in favor of it then it will go to the whole house here in
[38:42.840 --> 38:46.760]  Maryland and then if it gets voted favorably out of the house it'll cross
[38:46.760 --> 38:50.120]  over to the Senate and go through the same process there so it's still got
[38:50.120 --> 38:53.920]  several steps that meet it needs to go through in order for this to become
[38:53.920 --> 38:58.880]  decriminalized now so good see this happen and if not we're just hoping to
[38:58.880 --> 39:03.120]  see a lot of awareness built around the issue and for more people to look at the
[39:03.120 --> 39:07.440]  issue and start engaging directly with their local farmers so there are a lot
[39:07.440 --> 39:12.320]  of opportunities for the dairy industry to still intervene and and make sure
[39:12.320 --> 39:16.200]  that this doesn't get repealed right and they will be here today testifying an
[39:16.200 --> 39:20.600]  opposition as well as the health department so the dairy industry just
[39:20.600 --> 39:23.360]  to be clear I mean I don't know what the case is there locally but in other
[39:23.360 --> 39:26.640]  states I've seen the dairy industry be very very aggressive at trying to
[39:26.640 --> 39:31.240]  monopolize the market of milk by you know criminalizing raw milk fresh milk
[39:31.240 --> 39:35.280]  and making sure that everybody has to buy their pasteurized homogenized factory
[39:35.280 --> 39:40.960]  produced product is that how bad is that situation in Maryland oh it's also in
[39:40.960 --> 39:45.920]  Maryland in the past about 20 years we've lost over 500 dairies we're down to
[39:45.920 --> 39:51.520]  only 496 right now which is it's dismal and the prediction from the dairy
[39:51.520 --> 39:55.840]  industry itself is that we're gonna continue to lose dairy farms and they're
[39:55.840 --> 39:59.880]  gonna the ones that are gonna survive are gonna continue to be subsidized by
[39:59.880 --> 40:05.760]  federal tax dollars and their continued recommendation is to keep banning raw
[40:05.760 --> 40:11.160]  milk so here here we have the solution to the dairy failure problem and they're
[40:11.160 --> 40:16.120]  saying no no no don't do it it's it's reminiscent of like you know propping up
[40:16.120 --> 40:21.640]  a horse and buggy industry after the car comes on the market yeah incredible
[40:21.640 --> 40:25.120]  did you mention earlier that the name of the department there is called the
[40:25.120 --> 40:30.000]  Department of Health and mental hygiene is that correct that's correct that's the
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.040]  name of our health department here in mental hygiene what that's right is that
[40:34.040 --> 40:39.400]  like cleaning your mind of any aberrant thoughts what what what is mental hygiene
[40:39.400 --> 40:46.360]  well I've heard it translated as brain washing well that's exactly what it is
[40:46.360 --> 40:51.480]  wow the Department of Mental Hygiene that that should be in the novel 1984 I
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.760]  mean we should retroactively put that in in the novel the Department of Mental
[40:55.760 --> 41:01.640]  Hygiene cleansing you of all dirty thoughts such as individual ideas or
[41:01.640 --> 41:06.360]  or fresh milk from a farm oh my god that what a terrible thing so right and just
[41:06.360 --> 41:09.040]  one of the most important things to take away from this and that what I'm going
[41:09.040 --> 41:12.200]  to be asking the committee members to take away from this is that currently
[41:12.200 --> 41:16.280]  peaceful individuals are being criminalized for normal natural peaceful
[41:16.280 --> 41:20.320]  human behavior whether it's transporting raw milk across state lines or the
[41:20.320 --> 41:24.200]  farmers who want to be off or cow shares this is criminal activity but it's a
[41:24.200 --> 41:27.840]  very peaceful activity and so I'm going to be asking them to look at it in that
[41:27.840 --> 41:32.840]  context and to stop criminalizing our peaceful life well and can you remind
[41:32.840 --> 41:39.960]  them that it's legal in Cuba to do this it's it's legal to sell fresh milk in
[41:39.960 --> 41:46.640]  communist China in North Korea you know I mean come on America land of the free
[41:46.640 --> 41:53.240]  you can't buy and sell fresh milk from a farm and that our country was was raised
[41:53.240 --> 41:58.720]  on raw milk I mean come on right I mean it's completely backwards right now it
[41:58.720 --> 42:05.000]  really is well apparently Liz you have not had enough mental hygiene so you need
[42:05.000 --> 42:09.320]  some more mental hygiene therapies give us your website so that people can you
[42:09.320 --> 42:14.560]  know stay tuned into to your blogs and everything well I'm working with a
[42:14.560 --> 42:18.800]  farm food freedom coalition currently so it's farmfoodfreedom.org but we
[42:18.800 --> 42:22.160]  don't have updates on the specific legislation on that site but if you go
[42:22.160 --> 42:27.320]  to realmilk.com they have a section about what's going on in each state and
[42:27.320 --> 42:31.440]  I'm pretty sure they'll be covering it as well. All right realmilk.com great way
[42:31.440 --> 42:35.480]  for anybody out there who wants to connect to their local milk sources or
[42:35.480 --> 42:40.040]  other local food sources it's a great resource for that realmilk.com. Well Liz

[43:00.760 --> 43:05.720]  amazing commentary on the state of America today where we can't even buy
[43:05.720 --> 43:10.400]  and sell raw milk without being raided at gunpoint and go into prison and being
[43:10.400 --> 43:15.640]  considered a felon I mean it's unbelievable I just I can't believe
[43:15.640 --> 43:19.120]  that I have to sit here and talk about that of all the things that we should be
[43:19.120 --> 43:24.160]  talking about I you know I'd love to be talking about food self-reliance how to
[43:24.160 --> 43:27.600]  grow your own food supply I'd love to be talking about you know consciousness and
[43:27.600 --> 43:31.520]  the nature of reality but we got to talk about the criminalization of raw milk it
[43:31.520 --> 43:35.280]  drives me nuts all right let's let's move on to some other news but real quick

[44:03.960 --> 44:10.880]  told me that he's he's sobbing at the very very sad death of the tyrant Chavez
[44:10.880 --> 44:16.880]  and if can you get him some more tissue clean him up give him some mental
[44:16.880 --> 44:20.600]  hygiene and then we can get him in here how about that when he shows up just

[44:24.200 --> 44:30.320]  to some other news yeah the sound effects with it was it like a five second
[44:30.320 --> 44:36.480]  delay all right let me just say this about Chavez while while we're trying
[44:36.480 --> 44:45.080]  to wrangle in Max Chavez is part of this cult of what I call giggling control
[44:45.080 --> 44:49.560]  freaks all right these giggling control freaks are trying to take over the world
[44:49.560 --> 44:55.960]  they think everything is so funny oh there are no there are no bullets there
[44:55.960 --> 45:01.720]  are no armored vehicles there are no assault rifles they think it's so funny
[45:01.720 --> 45:07.080]  oh Piers Morgan wants to just pop around into Alex Jones it's so funny do it in
[45:07.080 --> 45:12.200]  uniform too isn't it hilarious they think everything's so funny to them
[45:12.200 --> 45:17.920]  control freaks all right enough enough of the giggling control freaks that was
[45:17.920 --> 45:23.200]  but that's who's running the system all right and it's these people that want to
[45:23.200 --> 45:26.840]  run everything every little detail of your life and Chavez was just one of them
[45:26.840 --> 45:31.720]  and he wasn't the worst you know I admit you know Kim Jong-un is probably way
[45:31.720 --> 45:37.880]  worse than Chavez it's a spectrum okay you've got Kim Jong-un on the far far
[45:37.880 --> 45:44.000]  far extreme radical left and then you've got Chavez sort of not quite as far
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.800]  left but still pretty far left and then you've got you know Obama right in there
[45:47.800 --> 45:53.520]  with the Chavez crowd and you know you've got you know China Communist China's
[45:53.520 --> 45:58.420]  over there and then on the on the far the the complete opposite end of the
[45:58.420 --> 46:01.960]  spectrum on the Liberty side you've got like Thomas Jefferson okay that's the
[46:01.960 --> 46:05.800]  complete opposite but these giggling control freaks are driving me nuts I
[46:05.800 --> 46:10.520]  just want to run everything in your life and it's like hi I miss his bossy

[46:23.240 --> 46:26.480]  Security well I guess in that case it would be like the Department I'm
[46:26.480 --> 46:33.240]  Janet Napolitano the Department of Homeland Security I'm miss his bossy
[46:33.240 --> 46:38.840]  pants and here joining us today is missus smarty pants she's the economic

[46:59.520 --> 47:04.360]  to run your life and Chavez's death was such a terrible terrible thing we are

[47:12.960 --> 47:16.560]  that's missus bossy pants making an appearance here in the Alex Jones show
[47:16.560 --> 47:23.680]  I'm sure I'll get called by Alex what were you doing man sorry sorry we both
[47:23.680 --> 47:28.600]  sometimes segue into weird characters weird comedy that's just that's just the
[47:28.600 --> 47:32.920]  nature of the beast all right North Korea vows to cancel the Korean War cease
[47:32.920 --> 47:39.080]  fire North Korea says that on March 11th that's just coming up by my count
[47:39.080 --> 47:44.240]  what is that five days away on March 11th it's going to cancel the the Korean
[47:44.240 --> 47:50.680]  War ceasefire agreement that was originally signed in 1953 so how
[47:50.680 --> 47:57.800]  wonderful will that be with a an insane a completely insane tyrant Kim Jong-un
[47:57.800 --> 48:04.800]  who has nuclear weapons all right and this guy is testing more nukes to
[48:04.800 --> 48:10.720]  miniaturize them to put them on intercontinental ballistic missiles ICBMs
[48:10.720 --> 48:16.200]  so that he can launch them into high altitude not even orbit but just high
[48:16.200 --> 48:21.240]  altitude above North America where he can detonate the nuke which will of course
[48:21.240 --> 48:29.640]  cause a massive EMP blast that will fry the entire power grid so if there
[48:29.640 --> 48:34.200]  actually is a threat against America a military threat I'm not talking about the
[48:34.200 --> 48:38.520]  you know the fictional nonsense war on terror everything's war on terror if
[48:38.520 --> 48:42.560]  there's a real threat against America it's North Korea all right if there's a
[48:42.560 --> 48:48.720]  real justification for going in and taking out a crazy nuclear armed tyrant
[48:48.720 --> 48:54.320]  who is threatening America like never before this is it Kim Jong-un I mean if
[48:54.320 --> 49:00.240]  if look overall I'm anti-war overall I'm anti-intervention I should say but I'm
[49:00.240 --> 49:04.040]  pro-self-defense and I'm pro-national defense this is a case for national
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.440]  defense I mean Kim Jong-un and if he gets those nukes onto those missiles and
[49:08.440 --> 49:12.600]  he he launches them over you know California or Oregon or Washington and
[49:12.600 --> 49:16.240]  sets those off in high altitude man we're gonna have an EMP blast wave your
[49:16.240 --> 49:20.560]  electronics are fried internet's down all these Facebook ad addicts are running
[49:20.560 --> 49:24.400]  around the streets like zombies trying to be online I'm not online what do I do
[49:24.400 --> 49:28.760]  where's this is bossy pants they're gonna freak out and they're gonna be
[49:28.760 --> 49:32.120]  hungry in about six hours they're gonna try to come after your food I mean it's
[49:32.120 --> 49:35.800]  that's a nightmare scenario imagine imagine if all the Facebook trolls
[49:35.800 --> 49:39.440]  actually came out of their parents basements all at once and flooding the
[49:39.440 --> 49:45.320]  streets with trolls and who actually have to face people face-to-face for the
[49:45.320 --> 49:49.400]  first time in their entire history it would be like what's that movie Bruce
[49:49.400 --> 49:52.960]  Willis surrogate right remember that we had to come out of there they were all

[54:21.880 --> 54:27.000]  all right we're continuing thank you for joining us this is the Alex Jones show
[54:27.000 --> 54:32.440]  Mike Adams the health ranger filling in for Alex today and be sure to check out
[54:32.440 --> 54:37.560]  info wars dot com for the latest breaking news by Paul Joseph Watson my
[54:37.560 --> 54:40.600]  website's natural news dot com if you want to check that out and I've got a
[54:40.600 --> 54:47.440]  story on Hugo Chavez today and the the cancer of socialism by the way air
[54:47.440 --> 54:51.000]  dykes just was talking to me during the break and he said that when he heard the
[54:51.000 --> 54:55.080]  phrase mental hygiene in our interview with Liz right zig that that set off a
[54:55.080 --> 54:59.200]  red flag in his mind because you know he researches a lot of the of the history
[54:59.200 --> 55:03.640]  of control of humans and the Rockefellers and eugenics and everything else
[55:03.640 --> 55:08.480]  and he said yeah that that phrase mental hygiene is a keyword of the eugenics
[55:08.480 --> 55:13.200]  movement and that's the name of the Maryland Department it is actually
[55:13.200 --> 55:18.160]  called what is it the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene that's the name
[55:18.160 --> 55:22.520]  when Liz said that it freaked me out I thought she misspoke or something but
[55:22.520 --> 55:26.560]  no that's the actual name of the department the Department of Health and
[55:26.560 --> 55:33.840]  Mental Hygiene so by that they probably mean castrating people of low IQ to
[55:33.840 --> 55:39.200]  fulfill their their eugenics little agenda you know that's probably the
[55:39.200 --> 55:43.400]  history there I bet that's part of the history of that department in Maryland
[55:43.400 --> 55:47.680]  I mean I can't say for sure I haven't done that research yet but I bet that's
[55:47.680 --> 55:51.920]  part of the part of the agenda and it's eugenics and depopulation and air and
[55:51.920 --> 55:57.560]  dikes of course knows all about that racial hygiene mental hygiene and
[55:57.560 --> 56:02.080]  also hey don't forget the whole history of psychiatry where a psychiatrist would
[56:02.080 --> 56:06.920]  do things like if they thought you were mad they would start pulling organs out
[56:06.920 --> 56:11.960]  of your body in fact there was one psychiatrist in fact he was the
[56:11.960 --> 56:16.520]  president of the American Psychiatric Association way back I believe he was his
[56:16.520 --> 56:21.400]  name was Dr. Henry Cotton and if you were crazy he would start pulling your
[56:21.400 --> 56:25.640]  teeth out and he would actually extract teeth and then he started
[56:25.640 --> 56:30.520]  extracting like nasal tissue from people I mean very painful stuff until you were
[56:30.520 --> 56:34.000]  cured and if you were still mad after having you know all your teeth pulled
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.880]  out then he would just start you know yanking more and more tissue until he
[56:37.880 --> 56:41.160]  got to the real disease you know that's psychiatry for you right there I'm not
[56:41.160 --> 56:47.080]  even making that up that's real just just search Dr. Henry Cotton just like it
[56:47.080 --> 56:50.680]  sounds cotton if you don't believe me search that and you'll you know you'll
[56:50.680 --> 56:55.960]  freak out and then of course the entire term hysterectomy which is of course the
[56:55.960 --> 57:01.840]  surgical procedure of removing a woman's reproductive organs that whole term
[57:01.840 --> 57:08.680]  means hysteria ectomy means getting out the hysteria and that surgery was
[57:08.680 --> 57:13.840]  originally pushed as a way to prevent women from being crazy I'm not making
[57:13.840 --> 57:19.240]  this up this is true history that that is you got to know the entire word
[57:19.240 --> 57:25.160]  hysterectomy means take the craziness out of the woman and that's what that's
[57:25.160 --> 57:30.640]  that's the history of psychiatry that's the history of medicine it's insane so
[57:30.640 --> 57:35.640]  I'm not surprised to see the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene
[57:35.640 --> 57:41.520]  being named the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene by the way if you want
[57:41.520 --> 57:47.600]  some real healthy health support immune support we've got clean chlorella now in

[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.720]  stops working so he's shooting videos and you know commenting and doing things
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:05.880]  which I don't blame him I can't stay away from all the crazy news either you
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:09.920]  gotta comment sooner or later but the schedule in case you're curious I believe
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.160]  that tomorrow some of the info warriors here are gonna be hosting I think Aaron
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:19.800]  Dykes is hosting and maybe McBreen maybe I'm not sure but and then Friday I
[01:01:19.800 --> 01:01:23.160]  think Catherine Albrecht is back on want to thank Catherine for hosting the
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:29.840]  last couple of days I'm not scheduled to host again until maybe another week so
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.920]  anyway I always enjoy being here and I thank you for your support in this
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:40.040]  great this time of great challenge as Alex says we are all info warriors fighting
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:45.000]  the info war so that we don't have to fight the physical war the real war of
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.360]  people slinging lead downrange now of course as I talked about in the first
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.800]  hour the radical left believes that all that's imaginary there are no bullets
[01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:57.400]  there are no guns there are no armored vehicles being purchased by DHS it's all
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:01.280]  just adds all your imagination but you and I know that it's actually real and
[01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:06.520]  so we want to fight the info war so that we can prevent the shooting war but
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:10.720]  we're not gonna settle for anything less than the complete restoration of the
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:16.440]  Bill of Rights and the Constitution that's a bottom line and I know that
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:21.200]  those words that that I just spoke reflect what many of you feel out there
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.120]  we are not settling for anything less than the complete restoration of the
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:29.520]  Bill of Rights in the Constitution why should we we're Americans we were built
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:35.320]  on resistance to tyranny you know we're just we're not gonna voluntarily go
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:40.920]  along with another Chavez type of ruination of the economy as he has
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.320]  done in Venezuela not not gonna happen here not in America definitely not in
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:52.480]  Texas definitely not in central Texas not gonna happen alright but let's let
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.600]  me get to some other news real quick just go through some headlines here
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:00.720]  economic collapse the Dow hits an all-time high meaning a bubble is
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:05.000]  always biggest right before it burst you know why the Dow is hitting a new high
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.480]  by the way because the money is increasingly worthless it's being
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:14.680]  eroded deteriorated by the continued quantitative easing infinite quantitative
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.080]  easing from the Federal Reserve pumping more money into the money supply making
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:22.000]  your dollars worth less and less every single day making the stock market look
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:27.600]  like it's higher and higher because it's it's the numbers of the stock market
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:31.480]  are actually worthless dollars or increasingly worthless dollars it is
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:37.280]  it is denominated the Dow is denominated in dollars right so there you go
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.000]  Attorney General Holder or we're to cover this the president can assassinate
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:47.560]  Americans on US soil how comforting to know that that we have such a such such
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:52.720]  an incredible defender of of law and due process sitting at the helm who says

[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:08.440]  wars.com and I'm not sure what the source of this story is but apparently the
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:15.440]  US US think tank American Enterprise Institute that says that it wants to it
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:21.680]  wants the US administration to have key demands to influence Venezuela now in

[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:45.480]  after Hugo Chavez perished at least his physical body did we can only guess
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:49.920]  where his soul is now but his body has perished from apparently from Kansas
[01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.600]  cancer and venezuela is of course in the kind of turmoil right now and no one's
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.600]  exactly sure what this means what's gonna happen next but here to give us a
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:05.640]  little bit of perspective on this is max cabrera he's an employee here at info
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.640]  wars he's from venezuela he doesn't have you know he's obviously not there so he
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.760]  doesn't know it's not like I'm right on the street no he's here in austin texas
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.640]  but at least he can give us some perspective so max thank you for joining
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.680]  us today thanks for coming in studio Mike thank you for the opportunity you
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:24.880]  have to be here yeah so give us what do you know so far well I have some
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.240]  information I've been calling people in venezuela and they're telling me first
[01:09:28.240 --> 01:09:33.440]  of all the streets are calm the army is out there they are taking care of the
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:39.280]  places the gas stations grocery stores because there has been a lot of panic
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:44.200]  buyers on the streets and also there has been a little bit of a looting in in
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:48.920]  certain areas but everything's under control now basically the country is calm
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:54.680]  in action but they are all confused about what's going to happen right right
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:59.960]  now the president is the is the former vice president of Venezuela his name is
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:04.160]  Nicolás Maduro he's gonna be the president for the next 30 days and then
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:10.080]  we will have elections there we don't know the candidates yet from opposition
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:18.040]  or from from the chavis party right we're still waiting on that and but even
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.760]  even thinking about that though that an opposition candidate would have to be
[01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.880]  candidate that would say well let's let's return more to a free market system
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:29.200]  but how do you even propose that when so much of the Venezuelan population is
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:34.320]  now on the government payroll getting the free everything I mean that seems
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.840]  unlikely right the opposition don't feel like they have a victory because yes
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.280]  the communism has been very well implemented in Venezuela a lot of
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.560]  people became depending on the government and now the governors there they
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:49.600]  keep pushing it like we have to keep going on this revolution they are taking
[01:10:49.600 --> 01:10:55.720]  all the ideology from chavis and and pushing it so there is nothing
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.320]  safe we can't say that okay we're out of communism now in Venezuela right right
[01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:04.520]  well and and of course when they talk about they want to continue the
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:08.280]  revolution they're talking about the Chavez revolution he which I guess he
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:12.240]  tried to begin in the early 1990s but then he got into power in what 98 yes
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:16.400]  and then he's been taking government government seizing private industry
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:20.640]  taking over the economy also I saw it was reported that Chavez himself amassed
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:24.240]  a personal fortune of two billion dollars while his own countrymen were you
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:29.600]  know living in extreme poverty well yeah he's being related to several weird
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:34.280]  scenarios I don't have evidence but there have been some cases where he's
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:40.240]  being related to drug dealing well nothing nothing for sure right well I
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:46.160]  guess I guess at this point then what you know we can't really do much here
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:50.840]  from America it seems but the people of Venezuela I feel deserve better than
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.600]  Chavez that's my feeling that's my feeling too that's my feeling especially
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:59.600]  because my family they they used to have businesses that were taken over and some
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:04.520]  of the businesses were still waiting to get paid for and a lot of families they
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.440]  have been destroyed because of the communist ideology and the and Venezuela
[01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.480]  people they have been separated between the communists and not and people that
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:18.480]  doesn't support it let's see if that changes now hopefully there will be a
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:23.040]  free market again and hopefully people will have the opportunity to that they
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:29.360]  used to have very previous to Chavez okay well well I want to wish your family
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:35.120]  safety thank you and blessings to them and all of your countrymen and women of
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:42.480]  course I I want to see I want to see Venezuela become more free I suspect you
[01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:48.080]  do as well but whatever happens will you keep us posted yes of course and if the
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.120]  elections whenever we have the date for the elections I will go down there to
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:55.320]  Venezuela to vote and I will bring some video and pictures I will talk to the
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:13:00.840]  people over there and I will bring that back to you real quick do you think will
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.120]  Venezuelan elections be as corrupt as American elections are or will they be
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:08.800]  more honest actually I was surprised the way they do the elections because I went
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:13.120]  over there I actually have some footage of it you have to vote you do an
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:17.000]  electronic vote and then you get a receipt of your vote oh yeah we don't
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.120]  get received in America put it in another box and then at the end of the
[01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:25.520]  day you're welcome to come in and they print out what they have electronically
[01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:29.880]  and they count all the receipts oh wow everybody's welcome to see it and I was
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.160]  actually there common sense it has to match you know what they have in the
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:36.720]  boxes what they have it electronically and then when it's approved by the
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:41.760]  people that was there they send that information so yeah it looks like if
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:45.400]  they are corrupting the the elections they are doing it fantastically because
[01:13:45.400 --> 01:13:52.720]  it's not it's not cash how amazing is it that Venezuela runs a more well a
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.720]  checksum system in the elections which is smarter than the way we run them here
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.920]  which is all just total electronic black box voter fraud and something else is
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.920]  that we do get a president because of the votes of the people so if somebody
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:09.400]  has a hundred votes that's where you're getting a hundred votes yeah if you have
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:12.360]  a thousand then you get a thousand so it's not here like the the electoral
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.560]  votes oh the electoral college the electoral college yeah right and also
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:21.720]  now Venezuela doesn't have a bill of rights like like America does it has
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:26.880]  some kind of it has a constitution but it's but it doesn't enumerate specific
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:33.360]  rights in the same way that we have it here okay correct correct so is that is
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:39.200]  that a barrier to the people you know protecting themselves from the March of
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:43.720]  tyranny well this really in Venezuela we have a problem which we have a lot of
[01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:50.000]  loss but they are not being considered for example right now Nicolas Maduro
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.120]  the vice president he shouldn't be the president he shouldn't he shouldn't it
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:58.640]  should be the Osvaldo Cabello and he chose to sign it this other guy to be
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:02.560]  the president meanwhile so even though we have the Constitution and we have
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:07.040]  rights they are really not implemented at the end of the day it's kind of a
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:11.120]  tyranny going on there and they do whatever they want and last question for
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:15.080]  you max because I know you've got a lot of work to do here but isn't it's oil I
[01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:19.520]  mean oil is the big is the big money maker in Venezuela so it really comes
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.480]  down to who controls the oil doesn't it right yeah it is like that so nobody
[01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:27.920]  knows Venezuela like the prices of the oil we don't know if they're gonna go
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:33.600]  up I can tell you right now Venezuela is in a phase where they don't know what's
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:37.180]  happening yeah they don't know what's coming next if it is something better or
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:44.160]  worse yesterday as soon as the news was given I tried calling my family they call
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:48.640]  cooling getting I mean people got excited people went out the streets to buy
[01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:53.640]  water food don't blame them yeah they don't know what's going on well and I
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.880]  think by the way you know Chavez he only died at age 58 I believe right right
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:03.560]  very young yes and he probably didn't know that there are natural cures for
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.120]  cancer many of them yeah I think it's sad that he went to Cuba to get treatment
[01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:12.760]  we have great doctors in Venezuela and actually I would say we have a better
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:18.160]  medical industry Venezuela that there is in Cuba so I'm shocked that he went
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:22.000]  over there I think that's a that's like in a slap in the face for the doctors in
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:28.160]  Venezuela yeah it is really and maybe he was scared of the doctors there so I
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.920]  mean this it is shocking how he just left the country to get this women there
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:37.800]  probably didn't know about natural ways to do it well you know only the really
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:42.080]  high-level elite know about the cures for cancer because right because you know
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:47.520]  people the globally like the top 1,000 controllers of the world they have easy
[01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:51.560]  access to all these cures right they but but they don't want the public to know
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:54.800]  about them well thank you max for the update thank you man on Venezuela and
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:00.600]  Hugo Chavez no longer no longer being with us I have to say I have to say he
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:04.680]  was a great leader seriously he knew how to talk to people he knew how to relate
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:10.320]  to people he well I mean Obama I mean Hitler was a great orator is yes I'm
[01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:13.800]  not saying he was doing something right or wrong I'm just saying he was a great
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:17.800]  leader right right now there are thousands and thousands of people on the
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:23.720]  streets supporting him they want to see his body so he was really a great
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.480]  leader in South America and around the world too bad his ideology was in the
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:32.320]  most appropriate for the country well you know I used to live in South America
[01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:38.240]  not Venezuela but I noticed that the cultures there do tend to side towards
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:42.640]  socialism and communism right that that just seems to be part of the cultural
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:46.720]  reflection down there so but I do believe that the people of Venezuela
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:50.960]  deserve much better than Chavez and I would like to see that nation become a
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:54.480]  nation of liberty and individual freedom I would like that too well thank you
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:59.640]  very much all right all right that was Max Cabrera everybody here in studio and
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:05.720]  info wars.com with some little bit of first-hand knowledge of what's going on
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:11.120]  in Venezuela now continuing by the way we've got James Stewart on the line is
[01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:17.760]  he we actually have him by Skype guys is he on the line okay great great cuz we
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:21.880]  had to we sort of delayed James Stewart because of this of Max coming in with
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:27.440]  the breaking news on Chavez so let me just say this there's another story on
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:32.840]  info wars.com Russian leader demands the investigation of Chavez's death and
[01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:38.720]  they're trying to blame his death on America yeah they're saying America gave
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:44.720]  him cancer which actually if you think about it America gives Americans cancer
[01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:49.720]  so it's really not that far-fetched all maybe Chavez came to America drank some
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:54.320]  diet soda ate a bunch of aspartame got some GMOs took some vaccines and yeah
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:18:58.000]  you know he died of cancer just like half the American population because you
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:01.640]  know of all this toxic food and medicine in this country so maybe they're right
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:06.720]  maybe America did give the guy cancer who knows all right let's transition
[01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:11.880]  we've got an incredible story here many of you know James Stewart he's known as
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:16.040]  the California raw milk man but this story today is not about raw milk this
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:22.400]  is about one man overcoming state tyranny the state of California tried to
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:27.640]  destroy this man they threw him in jail I mean they they practically tortured him
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.880]  in prison there I'm not gonna go into details but they mistreated him like
[01:19:31.880 --> 01:19:35.840]  you can't even believe and they brought him up in multiple felony charges they
[01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:41.520]  tagged him in the jail system as as a dangerous prisoner they tried to crush

[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:21.360]  California raw milkman James Stewart with his story of overcoming and attempted
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:26.800]  crushing of his liberties and freedoms by the state not just the state of
[01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:31.240]  California but the Fed the federal government had a hand in the raw milk
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:34.120]  raids against him but again he's got a story of coming back from that and
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:38.040]  James thank you for joining us today on the Alex Jones show you're welcome Mike
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:41.320]  thank you it's great to have you on sorry about the delay there but you know
[01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:46.160]  Hugo Chavez dying was definitely some breaking news we needed to cover there
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:51.200]  well I was actually listening to that and I think just one choice of words in
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.560]  there should have been changed and when he called him a great leader I think
[01:24:54.560 --> 01:24:58.080]  great sort of connotates the idea of good I think he should have used the
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.880]  word powerful leader right that's right yeah I don't I don't think that max you
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:06.120]  know worships Chavez or anything I think he was saying that he was an
[01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:12.400]  effective manipulator of the masses exactly basically yeah yeah well well
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:17.760]  said thanks for helping us clarify that so James you've got an amazing story
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.160]  here laid out for us but but just quickly first give us a very quick
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.240]  background of what happened to you for those who may not be familiar with your
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:29.920]  story and then we'll go into how you've overcome that well you know for 15 years
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:36.840]  we we when I say we at the community that was was called Ross and you know
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:41.080]  continue to grow and until the community was over a thousand people
[01:25:41.080 --> 01:25:45.440]  approximately of people that wanted to find the highest quality foods and that
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.760]  was always a influx as well always looking for higher quality foods but we
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:56.240]  were continually being attacked 2005 2010 and then finally closed in 2011 with
[01:25:56.240 --> 01:26:02.760]  my arrest and you know it turned out to I thought that it would all end pretty
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:06.960]  quickly and it did not at all and it just kept on going the case in LA was
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:12.840]  postponed and then continued and then then we then I myself and a lady named
[01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:16.720]  Sharon Palmer were arrested while standing in court on March the 2nd of
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:23.520]  last year for more felonies for the farm being purchased in Santa Paula of
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:28.720]  course I had and the club had very little to do with the investment in the
[01:26:28.720 --> 01:26:36.200]  farm if anything and that was handled by other people and so you know I ended up
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:43.200]  going to jail actually on my birthday of this last year was in jail for five
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:49.720]  almost four and a half to five months and then was transferred to LA and by the
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:55.360]  way when I was arrested for the the charges for in March the 2nd of last
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:02.000]  year I was actually taken first to Twin Towers downtown LA which is where they
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.760]  took me singled me out of line out of hundreds and hundreds of I would
[01:27:06.760 --> 01:27:10.400]  consider real criminals you know the people that were that be using the
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.520]  drug addicts and the murderers and whatever singled out by two guards taken
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:19.840]  into an office and accused of being and asked me if I were a sovereign and I
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:24.320]  said I don't know what you mean by that and anyway the long story was short is
[01:27:24.320 --> 01:27:28.960]  that they labeled me that and tortured me at that point by shackle me handed
[01:27:28.960 --> 01:27:33.360]  foot and shackled me to a bench put me in a holding tank for about five or six
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:38.640]  hours in a tank that probably was nobody was in there cold about 50 degrees with
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:42.920]  a t-shirt on and then finally four days later transferred to Ventura well when I
[01:27:42.920 --> 01:27:47.640]  was transferred back after I left jail in Ventura and they scanned my wrist band
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:51.000]  that I had on there the guy backed up from his desk and said you've attacked
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:56.360]  guards I think excuse me and they did the man said oh no shackle this man so
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:28:01.240]  obviously the status that now exists for me in the Los Angeles jail system is
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:05.640]  one as of a sovereign which means that I'm a threat to everybody and I'm a
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:09.480]  terrorist so so yeah this is incredible because your your crime is
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:15.240]  distributing milk unpasteurized milk so they label you in the jail system as a
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:18.880]  sovereign they have you wear a special armband just like you know Hitler made
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:24.640]  the Jews back in you know Nazi time they they treated you like what worse than a
[01:28:24.640 --> 01:28:28.240]  terrorist it's an incredible story I don't want to dwell on that but I'm I'm
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:31.560]  glad you provided that background so people know why this story is important
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:35.760]  and by the way you are correct the Rd wrist bands they put on you are
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:41.560]  different colors depending on your supposed status that's incredible but
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.160]  despite this I mean their goal I mean you're you're a man in your in your
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:49.160]  mid-60s you're not a young man most of those people were in there we're young
[01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:52.440]  and better able to handle that but they subjected you to hypothermia a type of
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:56.720]  torture but yet you've been able to overcome this now we're going to break
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:29:01.400]  in one minute and I want you to tell the complete story now what you're doing now
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:06.520]  to rise out of this attempt to crush your freedoms and crush your life I want
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:12.440]  to do that when we come out but in the one minute we have left give us an
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:16.960]  update are you still facing charges in one county or is that resolved no still
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:22.360]  facing charges in in one county and we're not sure where that's gonna go but
[01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:27.920]  it's it's daunting you know I mean at one point I had three criminal cases and
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.240]  three simple cases that I was dealing with all at the same time incredible and
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:35.520]  they confiscated all your food all your cash through you in jail destroyed the
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:39.680]  food it's just incredible and destroyed the club destroyed the club yeah it's
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:43.120]  shut down it's gone it's gone sounds like something Hugo Chavez would have done
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.600]  in Venezuela actually anyway stay with us folks we'll be right back with James

[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:45.640]  that's not even illegal in Cuba in China in North Korea or you know Peru or

[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:06.880]  share with people for a 30-second booth the reason why they have done this
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.760]  sovereign thing is because people actually believe like Judge Napolitano
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:16.600]  you see my TV all the time you know the the Constitution still exists their
[01:34:16.600 --> 01:34:22.000]  justification and answer to my question is why was well people have been
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.160]  murdering other people and killing other people calling them sovereigns
[01:34:25.160 --> 01:34:28.400]  they're they're shooting police officers and what so how do we know that's not
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.120]  you that was their answer I asked them a question that was their answer but you
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:38.040]  know according to the Constitution we're all sovereign individuals are we not yeah
[01:34:38.040 --> 01:34:43.200]  yeah and they're they're answered it so everybody's aware of that is now if you
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:47.400]  actually believe in the Constitution pretty much you're already labeled as a
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.760]  sovereign which means that you're already a terrorist well did you hear in the
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:53.640]  first hour we covered all these the bullets being purchased by the
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:58.720]  government the assault rifles the armored vehicles it's all imaginary we're
[01:34:58.720 --> 01:35:03.880]  told yes I yeah I heard that and I'm fully aware of all that as well but you
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:07.840]  know to get back to your question is one of the products that we had on the
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:13.600]  shelf at the club was a one of the most amazing products that I ever came across
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:19.000]  and it was an olive oil out of the country of Spain in which the trees
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.960]  themselves are anywhere from three to eight hundred almost a thousand years
[01:35:22.960 --> 01:35:29.000]  old I was amazed and the the story about this oil is the man that resurrected all
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.360]  this also resurrected two mills which had been idle for you know for 20 30 40
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:39.120]  years and never changed the inside of the mill so they're produced the same way
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:43.440]  that olive oil has been produced for thousands of years which is just big
[01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:48.600]  granite stones crushing it and then some pressure to push out the oil and what
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:53.920]  not then it's only bottled upon request so our first shipment will be arriving in
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:36:01.400]  about 30 days and you know people came in and purchased it at Rossum and would
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:07.240]  come back saying oh my god that's the best ever tasted you know and and the
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:12.040]  person who runs the company is now his name is Antonio Ray Soul is a former
[01:36:12.040 --> 01:36:16.600]  organic beekeeper so the man understands you know sustainability he
[01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:21.280]  understands non-gmo he understands organic you know so it's a pleasure to
[01:36:21.280 --> 01:36:24.920]  work with somebody who's still out there wanting to do the right thing see so
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:28.920]  that's what I love about about this story is so you're working with this
[01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:35.360]  olive orchard out of Spain that's 800 years old well the tree the trees
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:39.560]  themselves are 800 years yeah the trees if the property has changed hands how
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.200]  many times I'm sure you know it the trees themselves and you see these trees
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:50.040]  they're just magnificent and by the way I'm not sure that my but the people
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:53.280]  involved with me want to give out the website yet because that will be
[01:36:53.280 --> 01:36:58.200]  inundated most likely oh yeah yeah I think we might have to wait about another
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:02.360]  week or so before you do that it's no big deal I'll do a story about your
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:06.440]  website when the time comes this here today is more about you how you are
[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:11.200]  achieving an entrepreneurial victory and and creating business and creating
[01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:15.480]  prosperity where when they tried to crush you I mean the the state of
[01:37:15.480 --> 01:37:20.040]  California would rather you rot in prison but instead you are creating
[01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:24.320]  opportunities and health for people that's amazing Mike I never give up
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:30.400]  even it's I'll be 66 in July but no you're right and by the way I have no
[01:37:30.400 --> 01:37:36.080]  desire to collect unemployment or or be entitled that you know that the
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.400]  handouts and whatnot I have never functioned that way and so it took and I
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:43.720]  actually said when I was in jail that that was what I was a planning to do
[01:37:43.720 --> 01:37:47.800]  this whole thought of mine to do this and become the exclusive distributor for
[01:37:47.800 --> 01:37:51.880]  this incredible product was actually launched last year before I was even
[01:37:51.880 --> 01:37:56.160]  put in jail and luckily the the owner of the company decided he'd wait for me
[01:37:56.160 --> 01:38:02.880]  wow what a what a great guy well what do you see as given the experience of what
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:05.840]  happened to you because I can imagine when you were a child let's say in
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.920]  growing up and going to elementary school and they were teaching you American
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:14.120]  history and you were doing the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag you I you never
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:18.880]  could have imagined I would say that you would be thrown in jail over milk I
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:23.960]  never imagined I'd be thrown in jail for for helping to provide high quality
[01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:29.880]  foods to people in a private membership club now it the the thought of that now
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:36.080]  to me is incredulous and it's insanity but that's exactly what has happened do
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:41.680]  you and and you I mean you felt it personally do are you are you concerned
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:47.200]  about the direction of this country or I mean where do you think it's all going
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.920]  seriously concerned you know you know you and I talk about this and you are
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:55.760]  you report on this all the time about what's going on with the quality of the
[01:38:55.760 --> 01:38:59.960]  food sources around the country and around the world and you know I see
[01:38:59.960 --> 01:39:04.000]  what's going on not only with what happened to us but what's happening to
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.080]  farmers of all different kinds whether it's produce a pig their milk or what
[01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:13.040]  not it's getting crazier every day and you hear stories even more and more all
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:17.200]  the time where they're basically trying to squash anybody that wants to get
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:22.280]  involved in I guess high quality you know food right well we heard from Liz
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:26.960]  right dig earlier that the number of dairies small private dairies or you
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:32.320]  know commercial dairies in Maryland has been reduced by 50 percent we saw what
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.720]  the the the pigs in Michigan the farmers were ordered to shoot their own pigs to
[01:39:37.720 --> 01:39:42.200]  kill them because of that crazy law that just went into effect there we've seen
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:48.080]  front yard gardens attacked in Michigan in Oklahoma in Florida we've got the
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.840]  raw milk raids on you the Morningland dairy in Missouri and many others I mean
[01:39:52.840 --> 01:39:57.240]  these keep adding up James no they're they're now into the hundreds I'm I'm
[01:39:57.240 --> 01:40:02.440]  guessing it it just seems like it's going to get worse rather than better and I I
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.880]  just think that everybody needs to be more and more aware of what's really
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.880]  going on on the food source issue of think codes regulations laws are all
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.440]  being written and forced upon people and then you can't even even when you're
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.520]  supposedly doing it correctly they still come after you I mean the my favorite
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.920]  story is the farm to fork into that it oh that's where they raided that that
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:29.560]  outdoor picnic type of thing it was 16 or you know a dozen or so farmers all
[01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:33.480]  meeting on each other's private property bartering each other are you I'll give
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:36.880]  you eggs if you give me produce or your chicken or whatnot and they were
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:42.480]  contacted by the county and in the state of Nevada saying that they needed a
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:46.400]  permit to do it when she got the permit they came in basically after she had
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.880]  given them authority to control her they came and poured bleach over everything
[01:40:49.880 --> 01:40:53.880]  and destroyed the the entire community well that's the pattern that we see here
[01:40:53.880 --> 01:40:58.800]  it is the destruction of food and this fits the pattern from the top from the
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:03.600]  White House the destruction of the economy the destruction of jobs the
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:07.880]  destruction of liberties Eric Holder just said yesterday this is a letter to
[01:41:07.880 --> 01:41:12.280]  senator Rand Paul that yes the president can order the assassination of
[01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:18.880]  American citizens on US soil that's the attorney general saying that and it's
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:23.280]  that's blatantly illegal I saw that with the with the judge Napolitano being
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:28.720]  interviewed this morning I like that guy yeah I really like it well what do you
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:31.960]  think they took to show freedom watch yeah well of course yeah I can't have
[01:41:31.960 --> 01:41:34.720]  too much freedom did you see you can't even have a freedom license plate in
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:38.280]  Washington DC that's been banned you can't know I didn't know that no you can't
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:42.920]  drive around Washington with the word freedom on your car it's illegal oh my
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:47.560]  god it's getting so insane yeah it is insane well we're about out of time here
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:51.480]  James but do you do you I know you don't want to give out that your olive oil
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.960]  website yet but you have another website about that anyway but yeah we'll get it
[01:41:54.960 --> 01:41:57.560]  out for you but yeah you have a blog website or something where people can
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:42:03.120]  follow you and what you're doing yeah I might give it out it's under the name
[01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.880]  olive leash and fleece is the town in Spain where the olive oil is produced and
[01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:17.840]  that is pronounced or spelled F L I X as an x-ray and so it's O L I F L I X NA as
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:22.800]  in North America got it North America dot com all right that's a tricky domain
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:27.920]  running but we're not completely prepared yet but I think we will be in the
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:31.360]  next seven days yeah this is kind of a pretty long situation but really I just
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.840]  thank you for joining us I'm just glad that you have refused to lie down you've
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:40.800]  refused to become part of the system that was trying to crush you and you
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:45.600]  were standing out with American innovation and entrepreneurial ideas and
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.320]  that's what made America great and I will be until the day I'm not here anymore
[01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:53.280]  Mike good for you man well good to have you on today Mike thank you all right
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:43:00.680]  thank you James that was James Stewart everybody the the now resurging reborn
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:06.240]  in a new entrepreneurial context California raw milk man going to be
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:12.920]  dealing with olive oil now from hundreds of years old trees in Spain that's
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:16.520]  it's just it's just it's an amazing story I like to have these stories of
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.120]  success against the system you know and actually if you think about it info
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:23.960]  wars is another story of success against the system they tried to buy out
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:27.560]  essentially Alex Jones and put them on the networks they tried to say here take
[01:43:27.560 --> 01:43:31.320]  this money will make you famous and he said no he said I'm gonna build it
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:34.920]  myself I'm gonna I'm gonna you know wherever it leads me I'm gonna do it
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:41.080]  myself and he did and that's why info wars is here today so Dr. Lynn Seputo
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:46.880]  joins us now for the next segment he's on the phone with us Dr. Seputo welcome
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.640]  to the Alex Jones show thanks for for being on it's great to have you joining
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.880]  us now for our listeners who may not be familiar with you you are of course a
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.960]  doctor with a lot of alternative and and holistic medical knowledge and
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:07.960]  integration therapies lots of experience in that realm but I wanted to talk to
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:13.280]  you today about two things in particular Dr. Seputo and that is GMOs and
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:19.640]  vaccine damage to children which one do you want to start with all right well
[01:44:19.640 --> 01:44:22.200]  let's start with vaccines because there's news that just came out today
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:26.320]  that vaccines increase the risk of narcolepsy in children by an
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:29.960]  astonishing amount we've also had recent admissions by the scientific
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:34.880]  community that flu shots given to pregnant women cause a massive increase
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:39.680]  in spontaneous abortions so we know that the vaccines are killing babies and
[01:44:39.680 --> 01:44:42.720]  when they're not killed they're often damaged what are your thoughts on the
[01:44:42.720 --> 01:44:50.080]  subject dr. Seputo well we know that the whole flu shot industry is a scam there
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:54.280]  is very little data that shows that the first of all the shot even works in fact
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:59.040]  there's some data suggesting that it actually increases the risk that we have
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:05.800]  forgetting influenza it has not been tested for its safety adequately when
[01:45:05.800 --> 01:45:11.080]  you talk to people like Tom Jefferson who is from the Cochran group who's very
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:15.640]  prestigious group he says that the only thing that we really need to do if we're
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:20.760]  gonna solve this problem is go ahead and and take one group of people who has
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:25.360]  had the vaccine and see how they do over a year what whether or not it works or
[01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:28.360]  it doesn't work and what kind of side effects and complications there are and
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:32.200]  take another group and that don't give them the vaccine and see what happens
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:37.240]  and of course that is a simple inexpensive very effective way of
[01:45:37.240 --> 01:45:40.400]  testing vaccines but nobody wants to do that yeah they refuse to do that test
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.600]  they don't because they're they're horrified of the data that would come
[01:45:43.600 --> 01:45:47.120]  out of that well I think that's true when you're talking about an industry that's
[01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.680]  got a tremendous amount of income you're looking at hundreds of billions of
[01:45:50.680 --> 01:45:54.520]  dollars every year that is that comes in that way so it's not like it's a small
[01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:59.000]  amount of money and the conflicts of interest that exist between the CDC the
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:03.560]  FDA and the pharmaceutical industry are glaring it's like a revolving door
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:08.240]  between the CDC and the pharmaceutical industry look what happened to Julie
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:15.680]  Gerberding who was the chief of CDC before Obama came into office when her
[01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:20.720]  term was up she's employed by who Merck vaccine yeah right leading a global
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:25.160]  vaccine division I believe all right and some of the things they came out with
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:29.520]  with this vaccine is just atrocious I mean that the data behind it is terrible
[01:46:29.520 --> 01:46:33.640]  I wrote an article called the infection deception that's a free article it was
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:36.360]  published in the Townsend letter if people want to go to my website at
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:41.580]  drsaputo.com it's free and on the home page is your website is it DR
[01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:48.000]  saputo or spelled out dr saputo either way it's DRsaputeo will get you there
[01:46:48.000 --> 01:46:53.400]  okay you're a smart man cover every every combination well what about this I
[01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:57.080]  mean they couldn't make clean vaccines if they wanted to they could make single
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:02.440]  shot vaccines they have no mercury right no MSg no formaldehyde they could do
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:08.560]  that but it seems to me when this is my next question for you do they is it is
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:14.680]  it such a deep conspiracy that they're actually intentionally using vaccines as
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:21.080]  a a way in which to damage babies on purpose well you know you'd have to
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.960]  think that when you look at what's happened that's something like that is
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:29.360]  happening you wouldn't think anybody would be vindictive enough to do that
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.360]  haha yeah check human history man what they're doing yeah and so I mean you
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:38.560]  have to make the assumption that somebody doesn't care about our children
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:41.840]  and they're trying or they do care about them not that they want to make them
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:45.640]  sick because that's what's happening well or that they care about profit more
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:50.400]  than the than lives because if you if you brain damage a child or you damage
[01:47:50.400 --> 01:47:54.520]  their immune system with an early vaccine you actually generate recurring
[01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:58.840]  profits in the pharmaceutical industry for decades well that's right so it's
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:03.600]  it's a business investment the vaccine is a business investment in a damaged
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.640]  life well what you're looking at is a whole system in this country where
[01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:12.840]  money talks and we're serviced is if it's if it's there that's fine but if
[01:48:12.840 --> 01:48:16.720]  it's not they don't really care I mean look at the viac story I mean when
[01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:22.320]  when the pharmaceutical industry put that drug out in 1994 they knew that that
[01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:25.680]  was going to kill people with heart attacks and strokes yeah when the drug
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:29.720]  came out in 1999 they didn't do anything to mention that to the FDA that we know
[01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:34.640]  about yet in 2004 when the finally the FDA was forced to take it off the market
[01:48:34.640 --> 01:48:39.640]  because there are about 50,000 deaths from heart attacks and strokes that I mean
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:45.920]  there was no no punishment it was murder well no I believe it wasn't a Dr.
[01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:51.800]  David Graham the chief FDA scientist who even testified to that fact and for
[01:48:51.800 --> 01:48:56.160]  several other drugs as well so I mean just that one drug viacs if you really
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:01.640]  look at the numbers the one drug according to FDA science scientist
[01:49:01.640 --> 01:49:07.360]  testimony killed more Americans than the entire Vietnam War oh listen you're
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.200]  talking about a pittance of deaths when you look in big pharma I mean there
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.680]  what a 10,000 deaths not even that from the whole war that was in Iraq and now
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:23.800]  in Afghanistan and we believe we lose 400,000 people a year and this is
[01:49:23.800 --> 01:49:27.680]  documented yeah okay from pharmaceutical drugs that side effects and
[01:49:27.680 --> 01:49:31.120]  complications then and things that happen that you know even the words that
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:34.840]  are expected well that's why it's so astonishing to me that the the mainstream
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:39.560]  media will play up things like Sandy Hook and the shooting of several dozen
[01:49:39.560 --> 01:49:43.480]  children which is absolutely tragic and those lives should not be lost but then
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:49.560]  you've got an industry that's killing orders of magnitude more children you
[01:49:49.560 --> 01:49:55.280]  know every day yeah and with through vaccines and and chemotherapy drugs are
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:49:58.960]  now given to pregnant women which causes spontaneous abortions you know the
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.400]  flu shots are given to pregnant women it's insane well there's no question
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:07.280]  that the system is insane and and and that's what happens when you have a
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.120]  level of consciousness which we have in this country which is about me my mind
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:17.480]  and my stuff it's not about community it's not about trying to build community
[01:50:17.480 --> 01:50:20.560]  it's not about taking care of your neighbor it's not working together and
[01:50:20.560 --> 01:50:24.960]  until we increase our level of consciousness to a different level
[01:50:24.960 --> 01:50:29.320]  we'll never solve these problems that we're facing so being outraged isn't
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:33.120]  sufficient you have to evolve it into that place where you want to be the
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:37.360]  change you want to see well let's talk about that change because first give us
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.560]  well we're about to go to break but when we come back from break I want you to
[01:50:40.560 --> 01:50:44.920]  give us what can people do instead of taking a flu shot there you go what
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:49.360]  works better a lot yeah a lot better because I like you I haven't taken a
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:54.760]  shot in more than a decade I can't even remember the last time I had a vaccine
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:51:01.600]  and health has only improved since then hardly ever get sick I just rely on if
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:04.920]  you're listening you know your basic freedoms are being threatened every day

[01:53:12.560 --> 01:53:18.160]  created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:23.440]  more valuable than gold in a crisis 97% of Americans don't have this one
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:27.800]  critical item in fact they haven't even given it a thought and the sad truth is
[01:53:27.800 --> 01:53:32.640]  that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is
[01:53:32.640 --> 01:53:35.960]  right outside your door but I have to tell you could literally make the
[01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:40.120]  difference between life and death for you and your family watch my video at

[01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:19.440]  before you slip into unconsciousness I like to have another kiss another life
[01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:23.920]  welcome back this is the Alex Jones show we're joined by Dr. Len Zaputo right
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:28.480]  now we're talking about vaccine damaged babies and how the system seems to be
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:33.200]  actually intentionally trying to poison children and pregnant mothers with the
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:38.160]  vaccines because they could if they chose make so-called clean vaccines which
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.720]  don't have the toxic metals and chemicals that know that are known to
[01:54:41.720 --> 01:54:47.280]  cause neurological damage and basically brain lobotomies so Dr. Zaputo we before
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.440]  the break we said we're gonna talk about some solutions what works better than a
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:54.960]  flu shot oh just about everything we don't even know the flu shot works we
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:55:00.160]  have no data no data that shows that the flu shot works for kids or really
[01:55:00.160 --> 01:55:04.200]  anybody else okay that's a powerful statement to make but it's true our
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:08.640]  lifestyle is the most important thing vitamin D in particular get out get some
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:13.760]  sun when our vitamin D levels go down our immune system goes down and when it
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.640]  goes down you're vulnerable to all kinds of things going wrong not just virus
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:22.840]  infections like the flu but also cancers and and all other and many of the
[01:55:22.840 --> 01:55:27.920]  diseases we need vitamin C in that setting as well our diet is crucial
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.440]  but real real quick back on vitamin D though a lot of people think they can
[01:55:31.440 --> 01:55:34.560]  just go out and buy a supplement that's like 400 I use they just take one of
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:38.600]  those every couple of days and they're covered why is that not enough well it's
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:42.480]  totally inadequate I mean our body needs four or five thousand I use a day yep
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:45.560]  that's the standard amount and it needs to be taken with food or taken in a
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:51.640]  liquid that's a lingo or some other way that it gets to the body otherwise it
[01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:55.520]  doesn't absorb well and we have an epidemic of vitamin D deficiency that's
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:01.120]  enormous at this time most people are low in vitamin D levels and as I said
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:05.760]  immunity goes south of that time that's like 95 percent of the population is
[01:56:05.760 --> 01:56:10.120]  deficient exactly particularly in the wintertime where we don't get the UVV
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:14.440]  rays which are only present by the way in the rest the rest of the seasons
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:19.840]  between 10 and 2 in the daytime because there's no UVV there and isn't this also
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:24.800]  just one more symptom of what we might call indoor disease living indoors
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:29.280]  working indoors never getting outside you're gonna be deficient the human
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:34.840]  body was made to be outside and and we do we live in an asphalt jungle basically
[01:56:34.840 --> 01:56:38.720]  that where we just don't get done and it doesn't go through glass by the way so
[01:56:38.720 --> 01:56:41.440]  you can't get it through the window you can be out in the sun with your skin
[01:56:41.440 --> 01:56:46.800]  exposed but then the system tells us that the sun is bad that the sun is
[01:56:46.800 --> 01:56:52.000]  evil listen without too much of anything's no good okay right I mean you
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:54.760]  don't want to fry yourself obviously but that's right and it's when you get
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:58.240]  excessive burning of the skin that you get into problems with this with the
[01:56:58.240 --> 01:57:02.280]  cancer but right otherwise vitamin D prevents cancer we know a lot of data on
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:05.160]  that well but it's also you're more likely to get sunburned if you're
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.200]  deficient in other antioxidants there you go sure you've got to eat a healthy
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:12.880]  diet right people don't realize that you need your fruits and vegetables and all
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.640]  those antioxidants are in there absolutely diet huge sleeps another
[01:57:17.640 --> 01:57:21.320]  thing if you don't get enough sleep your immune system goes out miss just four
[01:57:21.320 --> 01:57:25.000]  or five hours one night in your natural killer cells which fight against cancer
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:30.720]  and viral infections goes down 30% and the same thing with exercise too much no
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:35.800]  good not enough no good got an exercise on most days for about an hour and then
[01:57:35.800 --> 01:57:39.240]  we're exposed to all these toxic things in the environment that causes
[01:57:39.240 --> 01:57:43.640]  tremendous suppression of our immune system and the rest of our body we got
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.360]  about a minute less left dr. saputo so to summarize things that work better than
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:54.200]  a flu shot what would you say list okay vitamin D sunshine get your diet where
[01:57:54.200 --> 01:57:58.200]  you're eating fruits and vegetables and the healthy things you need exercise
[01:57:58.200 --> 01:58:04.320]  sleep stress reduction avoidance of toxic exposures and then there are things
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:08.800]  like beta-glucanth the neck and they ship vitamin A the mushrooms that my
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:14.200]  talking shiitake mushrooms selenium and zinc herbs such as olive lead extract in
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:19.080]  garlic the homeopathic remedies all these things are fantastic and way better
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:23.080]  than a flu shot yeah people need the flu shot of people that don't have a good
[01:58:23.080 --> 01:58:27.400]  immune system they're the last ones that will respond to the flu well and
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:30.240]  they're also the most likely to be damaged by it if your immune system is
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:33.760]  already weak and you get a flu shot that's when you're lobotomized because
[01:58:33.760 --> 01:58:40.600]  you don't have any defenses against the toxic ingredients doctor saputo.com
[01:58:40.600 --> 01:58:49.120]  you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today

[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:25.480]  the news from the real world it seems negative and gets you down you still you
[02:01:25.480 --> 02:01:29.520]  can still have fun with it like we made fun of the TSA that was really fun you
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.200]  could find ways to make fun of things yeah well laughter is a very good medicine
[02:01:34.200 --> 02:01:40.320]  maybe the band laughter then because they'll call it you know it's it's it's
[02:01:40.320 --> 02:01:44.120]  an illegal drug the FDA says when you laugh your brain produces drugs does it
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:48.760]  not absolutely you're a funny guy it's but it's true your brain if you think
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:53.720]  about it your brain is a pharmaceutical factory I think on just any given day
[02:01:53.720 --> 02:01:57.040]  you're probably generating about fifty thousand dollars worth of free drugs in
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:00.680]  your own head oh wait way more than that if we had the drugs that we generate in
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:05.400]  our body we're worth trillions yeah trillions well maybe that's how we can
[02:02:05.400 --> 02:02:10.280]  pay off the national debt is to turn over our brain drugs we can show up at
[02:02:10.280 --> 02:02:15.920]  brain drug donation centers and the US can export serotonin or something to
[02:02:15.920 --> 02:02:19.760]  some other country yeah whether any a few thousand neurotransmitters and we we
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:23.560]  know about six or eight of them think we got the cats meow there we surf off face
[02:02:23.560 --> 02:02:28.760]  with our antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs it's a joke yeah smile goes a long
[02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:32.720]  way can you imagine them plugging us all in like it's a scene out of the matrix
[02:02:32.720 --> 02:02:35.600]  where they have like tubes coming out of your head yeah we're harvesting brain
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:40.520]  drugs from big pharma to research more cures do your part show up and get a
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:44.400]  brain plug today and have a little like green ribbon that you wear to show yeah

[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:57.080]  want to give you a chance to talk about your new book also what give us the
[02:02:57.080 --> 02:02:59.880]  title and where people can find that because it's great it's called a return
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:03.360]  to healing is about radical health to reform in the future of medicine it's
[02:03:03.360 --> 02:03:07.160]  on my website that's the best price at dr. sabooter.com but you can get on
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.640]  Amazon as well and it really looks at all the things that work that you guys
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:15.400]  talk about all the time in health care that are big problems it looks at the
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:21.040]  flaws in medical education in the big pharmaceutical industry the World Health
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.000]  Organization systems that have to do with our training that's a problem the
[02:03:25.000 --> 02:03:29.120]  medical research industry so it's looking at all the aspects of health care
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:34.440]  that we need to do a lot of reform on true reform we start looking at lifestyles
[02:03:34.440 --> 02:03:38.960]  are as our big approach to healing what do you think about this news a miracle
[02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:43.720]  drug for multiple sclerosis has been pirated from the Cordyceps mushroom and
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:49.360]  turn into a drug that's now being sold for $48,000 per year per patient listen
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:55.920]  I think that's great business to make a lot of money on that deal first of all
[02:03:55.920 --> 02:03:59.760]  just hype it up is to be something it's not probably yeah and then sell it for a
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:03.320]  lot of money so people want it then go to the government and see if you can work
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:07.480]  out some kind of relationship so that we can get this thing paid for by Medicare
[02:04:07.480 --> 02:04:11.840]  and insurance companies right what a deal yeah well they're making money hand
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.920]  over fist with that when all people really need to do is eat the mushroom
[02:04:16.920 --> 02:04:21.080]  truckload that's the worst thing yeah well it's Cordyceps has got other
[02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:24.960]  benefits but isn't this amazing the biopiracy by Big Pharma it's out of
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:28.960]  control well it's of course it's out of control that's why we have direct to

[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:03.160]  just talking the last segment about how what good medicine laughter is you know
[02:09:03.160 --> 02:09:06.880]  so we're gonna laugh at the TSA good it's gonna be kind of some dark comedy
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.400]  because there's some serious issues here but well they give us all kinds of
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:13.440]  opportunities for for satire and comedy that's right that's right you know we've
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:17.640]  got operation Paul Revere coming up and you know ridicule is a really powerful
[02:09:17.640 --> 02:09:22.160]  weapon yes you guys did that really well on your side I love that TSA video you
[02:09:22.160 --> 02:09:26.320]  did oh TSA help wanted yeah yeah yeah like right when I saw that you know but
[02:09:26.320 --> 02:09:30.960]  yeah and yesterday they were in the news of a lot of incredible stuff you know
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:35.760]  the sequester's coming up yep and Janet Napolitano was telling everybody look
[02:09:35.760 --> 02:09:38.280]  I'm not trying to scare you I'm just trying to inform you but we're gonna be
[02:09:38.280 --> 02:09:41.560]  furloughing people and you're gonna have very long waiting times at the
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:45.320]  airports right right turn out to be a total lie right but two days just
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:50.960]  before that they spent 50 million dollars on new uniforms oh 50 million
[02:09:50.960 --> 02:09:54.880]  dollars okay and you know put that in perspective they've got here's some of
[02:09:54.880 --> 02:10:01.520]  the numbers they've got 44,000 employees right so that's 1136 dollars per
[02:10:01.520 --> 02:10:06.720]  uniform wow yeah wow where do they where do they buy these $1100 TSA uniforms are
[02:10:06.720 --> 02:10:10.000]  they magic do they have good yeah it's probably make them invisible or something
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:14.080]  that's right that's right yeah they're not bullet proof or water proof or
[02:10:14.080 --> 02:10:16.200]  spill proof you know because they're worried about your liquids I don't know
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:21.120]  what what it is about it and it got me thinking about well here's here's a
[02:10:21.120 --> 02:10:24.480]  serious thing okay first before we get into the other okay let's be serious
[02:10:24.480 --> 02:10:28.400]  alright yeah let's get about the TSA yeah so you know I'm looking at this and
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:31.760]  it's like okay if they've got 44,000 employees okay there's another article
[02:10:31.760 --> 02:10:37.600]  saying that their uniform allowance is 446 dollars per year for these employees
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:43.160]  well it's only about 40% of the cost yeah right so the question is are they
[02:10:43.160 --> 02:10:47.720]  shoveling this money somewhere else or because this is to be provided over a
[02:10:47.720 --> 02:10:52.960]  couple years or are they looking to maybe increase the size of the TSA army
[02:10:52.960 --> 02:10:57.520]  right oh right add add people two and a half times you know for that that of
[02:10:57.520 --> 02:11:00.560]  course maybe they're looking at multiple year use of these things or
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:04.080]  something well I think the the sequestration I think we should instead
[02:11:04.080 --> 02:11:07.600]  of cutting people we should cut the uniforms and let the TSA work naked
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:10.880]  that's right and that way we will know that they're not hiding anything in
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:13.640]  their pants that's right yeah but these little importers want us to be
[02:11:13.640 --> 02:11:17.600]  unclothed not at them right apparently special ones and the interesting thing
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:20.480]  about this and this is in an article a couple of these things were in articles
[02:11:20.480 --> 02:11:24.600]  that were linked on you match can you imagine those TSA agents naked I'm sorry
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:28.520]  that's a disturbing image there are things you should never do never imagine
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:32.680]  TSA people naked don't pee on the electric fence nothing you know don't eat the
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:37.320]  yellow snow and things you should never do basically that's right okay well and
[02:11:37.320 --> 02:11:42.680]  also here's another serious thing okay this is a marine lieutenant combat
[02:11:42.680 --> 02:11:48.760]  lieutenant gets $400 once for uniforms okay as an allowance these guys are
[02:11:48.760 --> 02:11:53.160]  getting 446 per year wow and they just doubled that from what they had before
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:56.760]  but to give you an idea of inflation okay I thought back you know I started
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.520]  thinking about these little emperors running around with their new uniforms
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:02.680]  anything it made me think back to the Nixon White House do you remember that
[02:12:02.680 --> 02:12:05.800]  you remember when Nixon had like the Imperial Guard uniforms that he had at
[02:12:05.800 --> 02:12:12.560]  the White House I think I was in diapers that they made one appearance okay
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.480]  he'd taken a European tour and he was real infatuated with all the poppin
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.280]  circumstance in Europe right uh-huh so he went out and had uniforms made for the
[02:12:20.280 --> 02:12:23.280]  White House staff and we've got it you can't see it on the radio but we've got
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:28.240]  a got a link to it that we can pull up here and he got these uniforms for them
[02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:32.280]  they wore them only once and they were so ridiculed that they never wore them
[02:12:32.280 --> 02:12:36.840]  again really yeah they were white jackets with black leather caps okay and
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:41.120]  they had I've got something here that that talks about but you can look at
[02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:44.320]  it's they're white and they've got they look like a marching band uniform can
[02:12:44.320 --> 02:12:49.040]  you guys show that for prisonplanned.tv members and those are the caps I see
[02:12:49.040 --> 02:12:52.200]  the caps yeah that's what they actually wound up being they actually wound up
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:59.160]  being a marching band uniform here's a description a white cream tunic made out
[02:12:59.160 --> 02:13:04.360]  of a lastique with a double breasted cut three buttons a stand-up collar gold
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:09.160]  nylon trim and a vinyl cap and they had little black leather capes with it as
[02:13:09.160 --> 02:13:13.920]  well and it had like metal things capes yeah and on the collars it said WH for
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:18.480]  White House and all this kind of stuff I think TSA should wear capes like super
[02:13:18.480 --> 02:13:22.520]  man running around reaching down your pants with a cape on that's right well
[02:13:22.520 --> 02:13:26.600]  they they only cost $95 though I mean they got a they got a deal on that's a
[02:13:26.600 --> 02:13:30.040]  deal when you look at it I mean they're pretty fancy for $95 of course the feds
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:33.920]  devalued our currency quite a bit and they intervening 40 years but these are
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:37.440]  some of the views they got some of the people said they look like late Weimar
[02:13:37.440 --> 02:13:41.600]  Republic other people said they look like they're from a Lithuanian movie or
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.720]  they look like Nazi uniforms so they not they mothball these things and 10 years
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:50.920]  later Alice Cooper tried to buy some of them and they wouldn't sell them yeah
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:55.240]  and they eventually gave them to a Utah college where they use them as marching
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:58.160]  band uniforms so I thought you know with all these with all these uniforms that
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:02.080]  the TSA is buying you know about a hundred people per marching band they
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:05.840]  could have about 500 marching bands they could outfit with these silly uniform
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:10.600]  you know it seems to me that when you have no real authority you have to have
[02:14:10.600 --> 02:14:14.440]  a really fancy uniform mm-hmm that's that's why you know John Cleese did his
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:18.240]  thing about the Department of Funny Walks that's right it's funny walking and
[02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:23.560]  it like the more corrupt your government the more you have to embellish it with
[02:14:23.560 --> 02:14:28.440]  crazy little walks crazy little uniforms mm-hmm because you don't have any real
[02:14:28.440 --> 02:14:32.360]  authority there right right this is all facade and one of the things that they
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:37.080]  had to agree to when these the marching band got it they had to agree they had a
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:40.120]  lot of regulations that the Secret Service gave them the Secret Service is
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:45.080]  very interested that they not sell these things to Alice Cooper that they really
[02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:48.880]  that they would not use them in any way in a way that would debase the
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:53.760]  presidency okay now I looked at that and I thought well you know the person who
[02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:58.800]  debased the presidency was Richard Nixon kind of pride to think that he needed
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:02.440]  that kind of pomp for his personal guards yeah but even think about it though
[02:15:02.440 --> 02:15:06.720]  in contrast Richard Nixon didn't even say yeah I can drone strike Americans on
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:11.000]  US soil yeah that's right I mean Nixon was mild compared to what we're seeing
[02:15:11.000 --> 02:15:14.520]  today he was just kind of getting warmed up you know it's a this tyranny kind of
[02:15:14.520 --> 02:15:18.360]  rolls out slowly right yeah he was kind of on the cutting edge you know but
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.120]  maybe he was saying you know instead of saying I'm not a crook maybe he was
[02:15:21.120 --> 02:15:26.840]  saying I'm not a cook you know but it just kind of rolls out but the other
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:30.920]  thing that was interesting I thought with the TSA is you notice that they're
[02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:34.720]  going to start allowing knives and golf clubs like that I've been waiting for
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:38.520]  that yeah I might start flying again if I can bring a knife on now that's a
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:43.560]  inch blade yeah that's right gee but now that's only gonna be legal in April you
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:46.480]  know the end of April if you were to carry on something like that now you'd
[02:15:46.480 --> 02:15:49.920]  be in a lot of trouble so what's the deal do all the TSA people now have enough
[02:15:49.920 --> 02:15:53.080]  pocket knives that they've confiscated from everybody and now they figure we
[02:15:53.080 --> 02:15:56.280]  just can't handle any more freaking knives that's right legalize them again
[02:15:56.280 --> 02:16:00.280]  for God's sake glad the market on knives and nail clippers I guess yeah I don't
[02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:03.840]  know well the nail clippers there's no word as to whether or not nail clippers
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:09.440]  are still a security threat or not so I don't know it's that little file part yeah
[02:16:09.440 --> 02:16:14.360]  you could file off the lock on the the door that's right to the flight deck
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:18.920]  that's right and get in that way with your nail clippers yeah what about I
[02:16:18.920 --> 02:16:23.000]  heard they were gonna still not allow golf clubs or a certain number of golf
[02:16:23.000 --> 02:16:26.440]  clubs or what's the deal on that there was some stuff on this it's like they're
[02:16:26.440 --> 02:16:31.760]  not gonna allow liquids still okay but you can take lacrosse billiards and
[02:16:31.760 --> 02:16:37.400]  hockey sticks ski poles and two golf clubs three would be a danger I guess two
[02:16:37.400 --> 02:16:41.400]  to one for each hand basically is what they're saying you can have two clubs
[02:16:41.400 --> 02:16:45.680]  one in each hand that's right but the third one now it's all totally arbitrary
[02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:49.040]  right but the interesting thing about you know whether getting opposition to
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:53.720]  that from flight attendants flight attendants yes yes yes yeah these people
[02:16:53.720 --> 02:16:58.680]  who enforce this kind of bizarre imaginary world on us I think that every
[02:16:58.680 --> 02:17:00.960]  time you know when they go down they tell you got to turn off your cell phones
[02:17:00.960 --> 02:17:05.640]  right you can and they're very explicit about saying that you can't put it in
[02:17:05.640 --> 02:17:10.720]  airplane mode oh okay now right do they actually even understand what airplane
[02:17:10.720 --> 02:17:15.840]  mode is you know they rather you isn't that off exactly what the thing is if
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:20.520]  you just turn it off like they ask you to make the screen go black okay your
[02:17:20.520 --> 02:17:24.520]  your phone is still sending and receiving signals yeah still working as a
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:29.600]  radio it just doesn't look like it okay yeah and so but you know if you if you
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:34.040]  actually put it in airplane mode that shuts off all radio signals it's not
[02:17:34.040 --> 02:17:37.160]  looking for anything it's not sending anything right that's why they call it
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:41.360]  airplane mode yeah exactly brilliant but that doesn't kind of get through to the
[02:17:41.360 --> 02:17:45.000]  flight attendants you know they they don't really understand that and and I
[02:17:45.000 --> 02:17:48.000]  guess it kind of gets to the point you know what this is all about it's all
[02:17:48.000 --> 02:17:52.920]  about theater it's all about appearances sure they want your phone to have the
[02:17:52.920 --> 02:17:56.960]  appearance of being off even though it's not really well it's like they say
[02:17:56.960 --> 02:18:01.400]  don't you can't bring liquids on the plane but your body is 75% water right
[02:18:01.400 --> 02:18:04.880]  so you know if a terrorist wanted a little liquid bomb all they have to do
[02:18:04.880 --> 02:18:09.800]  is swallow a little baggie of liquid go into the bathroom vomit it back up they
[02:18:09.800 --> 02:18:13.840]  got the liquid bomb I mean what's the big deal right right or or have a fake
[02:18:13.840 --> 02:18:20.800]  breast you know prosthetic with liquid in it I'm not I'm sure I'm not giving
[02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:23.920]  terrorists new ideas these are kind of obvious things right right this liquid
[02:18:23.920 --> 02:18:27.640]  thing is crazy well it's it's been security theater for a long time
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:33.160]  everybody's known it's been theater I flew with my sons in 2001 before
[02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:37.560]  September 11th and I told him I said this is just the stupidest theater that
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:43.240]  you receive this is all about you know a power trip it's all about making people
[02:18:43.240 --> 02:18:45.720]  think that the government is there to protect them that the government is
[02:18:45.720 --> 02:18:49.080]  going to save them and keep them secure and just a few months after that you
[02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:53.160]  know you had 9-11 remember that show that comedy improv show called whose line
[02:18:53.160 --> 02:18:56.920]  is it anyway I know I don't remember that really that was that was I remember
[02:18:56.920 --> 02:19:00.680]  seeing that and it was that was set up improv situations I found that this was
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:04.840]  useful every time before I would go into the airport I would imagine I'm going to
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:09.800]  view a whose line is it anyway show where they're acting like security experts
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:15.560]  and then there's the TSA oh my god it's so funny yeah yeah that's right well it's
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:20.680]  it's sad but it's kind of like a dark comedy you know it's kind of like
[02:19:20.680 --> 02:19:25.000]  Terry Gilliams Brazil yeah remember how he had they had all the monitors for the
[02:19:25.000 --> 02:19:28.200]  watching everybody and all the stuff you know it's just real oppressive and
[02:19:28.200 --> 02:19:31.480]  brutal regime but it doesn't really quite work no it doesn't it doesn't work
[02:19:31.480 --> 02:19:38.320]  massive failures and I've I've wondered to how does the TSA train itself to feel
[02:19:38.320 --> 02:19:43.720]  down your pants do they pat each other down and to get good at it I do they
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.520]  work on dummy models how do they do that because they're experts I don't want to
[02:19:47.520 --> 02:19:52.080]  try to visualize that yeah I mean either well anyway more more satire at the
[02:19:52.080 --> 02:19:55.240]  TSA's expense straight ahead right here on the Alex Jones show with David Knight
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:19:59.600]  in studio stay with us we'll be right back

[02:24:16.760 --> 02:24:20.840]  Alex Jones show thanks for listening in this is the third hour of today's
[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:26.600]  broadcast on this Wednesday still Wednesday yeah March 6th 2013 Mike Adams
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:30.920]  filling in here with David Knight in studio and we're talking about the TSA
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:34.680]  actually we're making fun of the TSA but what do you what do you think about the
[02:24:34.680 --> 02:24:40.000]  notion David that when you go on a flight you are in effect submitting to be a
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:44.720]  prisoner yeah for the entire duration from from when you check in to when you
[02:24:44.720 --> 02:24:48.680]  get off the plane you're a prisoner oh yeah absolutely it's a police state and
[02:24:48.680 --> 02:24:51.240]  it's a silly police state like I was talking about you know they don't really
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:55.360]  understand even how cell phones work right and you stop and think about it
[02:24:55.360 --> 02:24:58.960]  that's another thing too about the 9-11 narrative I mean if you understand how
[02:24:58.960 --> 02:25:03.640]  cell phones work you know that nobody was calling and talking to somebody at a
[02:25:03.640 --> 02:25:07.280]  call station right a long time right it's such an obvious hole in the in the
[02:25:07.280 --> 02:25:11.800]  official story right right if anybody's ever tried to make a cell phone call
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:16.160]  from yeah probably pretty much know that because the cell phone towers are have
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:20.360]  an antenna pattern that deliberately is focusing the energy horizontally right
[02:25:20.360 --> 02:25:26.080]  vertically right okay and you'll be passing through the cell phone cells so
[02:25:26.080 --> 02:25:29.920]  quickly that they couldn't switch to keep up with you right so I mean there's a
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:33.760]  lot of different issues here but yeah it just doesn't work and that's why they
[02:25:33.760 --> 02:25:38.440]  put Wi-Fi and they put phone service on the planes because your phones and your
[02:25:38.440 --> 02:25:43.120]  Wi-Fi doesn't work on a plane but you know it's the whole thing is silly from
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:47.320]  the start to the finish and like we were talking about during the break we just
[02:25:47.320 --> 02:25:50.620]  don't travel that much anymore we try to avoid it you you know you avoid it
[02:25:50.620 --> 02:25:55.920]  totally I I've got family still in North Carolina so I can't completely avoid it
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:26:01.080]  and I've done more traveling in the last few months and I've done in decade well
[02:26:01.080 --> 02:26:06.880]  the thing is I I would love to have an airline called open carry airlines yeah
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:11.040]  where to get on the plane you got to bring a gun that's right because I mean
[02:26:11.040 --> 02:26:17.120]  that I would I'd be on there with veterans and cops FBI agents and concealed
[02:26:17.120 --> 02:26:21.800]  carry citizens I'd bring my Glock we should all be armed you think a terrorist
[02:26:21.800 --> 02:26:25.640]  is gonna get on a plane like that no no way I mean the only requirement you got
[02:26:25.640 --> 02:26:29.160]  to bring a frangible ammo that's it they check your ammo at the gate here
[02:26:29.160 --> 02:26:34.240]  frangible ammo get on the plane be the safest plane in the sky that'll never
[02:26:34.240 --> 02:26:38.560]  happen because remember they when they had they banned cigarette smoking yeah
[02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:41.560]  right okay which I agree with I don't want to breathe other people smoke on
[02:26:41.560 --> 02:26:44.880]  the plane right I don't know but some people talked about you know having
[02:26:44.880 --> 02:26:48.040]  plane flights where they were just gonna be all smoking oh yeah they can have
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:51.760]  that sure you know they won't allow that right yeah when they used to have
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:55.960]  before they did that you had some airlines I remember there was one airline
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:27:00.660]  that used to have a Texas run called Muse air was a spinoff some executives in
[02:27:00.660 --> 02:27:05.560]  Southwest and and they had flights where there was no smoking you know for these
[02:27:05.560 --> 02:27:08.760]  short flights so they knew there was a market for people who didn't want
[02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:12.080]  smoking well there was also a market for people who wanted true smoking all the
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:16.360]  time right right they won't allow even that it's just the the way the nanny
[02:27:16.360 --> 02:27:20.120]  state is I'm all about choice you know if you want to have if you want to smoke
[02:27:20.120 --> 02:27:23.840]  on the airplane that's fine you want to have a smoke an all-smoking flight they
[02:27:23.840 --> 02:27:28.120]  should allow that mm-hmm well I mean look at look at Bloomberg's nanny state in
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:31.960]  New York right you know you can't smoke inside your barbershop right so they've
[02:27:31.960 --> 02:27:37.480]  had some guys actually get loitering tickets for going outside of the barbershop
[02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:40.280]  while they're waiting for somebody to come in they go outside their own barbershop
[02:27:40.280 --> 02:27:43.560]  and light up a cigarette and stand there in front of their barbershop and then the
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:48.600]  cop gives them a ticket for loitering that's crazy oh yes New York I I think
[02:27:48.600 --> 02:27:51.800]  New York should have a Department of Mental Hygiene like we have in Maryland
[02:27:51.800 --> 02:27:56.000]  now I just learned today it's a Department of Mental Hygiene do you
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:00.360]  think Bloomberg could pass the inspection yeah well no see but that's the
[02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:03.600]  thing you notice they don't give drug tests to members of Congress mm-hmm you
[02:28:03.600 --> 02:28:07.560]  don't even have to pass a constitutional proficiency test to get into the Senate
[02:28:07.560 --> 02:28:11.200]  right right you don't even have to know what the Bill of Rights is at all and
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:14.080]  probably they can't read right because they maybe they can obviously read the
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:17.080]  bills yeah they have to pass them to find out what's in them I think half of
[02:28:17.080 --> 02:28:21.240]  them are psych psyched out on psych drugs I think they're on you know all
[02:28:21.240 --> 02:28:24.760]  kinds of drugs that inhibit their cognitive function we should drug test
[02:28:24.760 --> 02:28:28.720]  Congress that's what I'm saying yeah yeah well there's also that you know that
[02:28:28.720 --> 02:28:32.560]  green money that you know kind of messes up the way they think to you know yeah
[02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:36.360]  the something of a drug to them the ultimate addiction yeah cash that's
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:41.880]  right they definitely go for that $100,000 per vote but have you ever
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:45.800]  noticed getting back to airplanes that pilots treat you on the airplane the
[02:28:45.800 --> 02:28:50.000]  same way that the White House treats the press it's like you're sitting on the
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:54.200]  runway something's broken on the plane something's obviously broken the wing is
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:59.600]  falling off the pilots like yeah we're doing a routine check up here gonna be
[02:28:59.600 --> 02:29:02.160]  sitting here for a few minutes and they always blame it on the control tower
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:07.160]  that's right the control tower told us to waste six hours of your time that's
[02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:10.440]  right it's the control towers fault that's right there's never any problem
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:14.240]  here right yeah that's isn't that Obama though there's never any problem yeah oh
[02:29:14.240 --> 02:29:18.760]  yeah absolutely yeah yeah we don't have we got a sequestration problem but you
[02:29:18.760 --> 02:29:22.640]  know we can still spend $50 million on uniforms and we can send $250 million
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:26.960]  to Egypt or whatever I mean it's you know they can find the money to do what
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:31.080]  they want to do but they're gonna release criminals on in the streets to
[02:29:31.080 --> 02:29:35.640]  threaten the population yeah at the same time yeah that's that's what they do

[02:34:10.720 --> 02:34:16.600]  and coming at you from the headquarters of the organization info wars that is
[02:34:16.600 --> 02:34:20.440]  spearheading the effort to turn this around this is the Alex Jones show
[02:34:20.440 --> 02:34:25.240]  Mike Adams filling in today Aaron Dykes now joins us in studio with updated
[02:34:25.240 --> 02:34:30.880]  information some some good stuff from Aaron and to start off with what's
[02:34:30.880 --> 02:34:35.040]  going on with Rand Paul and his attempted filibuster right now well as you
[02:34:35.040 --> 02:34:38.680]  know they put forward John Brennan one of Obama's key advisors who actually
[02:34:38.680 --> 02:34:42.640]  creates the drone kill list and brings it to Obama's desk each week he's being
[02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:47.040]  nominated for CIA and so Rand Paul is filibustering right now in the Senate
[02:34:47.040 --> 02:34:50.800]  that nomination and saying he wants the Obama administration to promise not to
[02:34:50.800 --> 02:34:54.920]  kill American drones we've got a report up on info wars government
[02:34:54.920 --> 02:34:59.320]  emergency alert test interrupts the Rand Paul filibuster and that's interesting
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:04.360]  because of all the sneaky tactics we saw during the wrong the Ron Paul run for
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:08.960]  the campaign all the blacking out in the media sometimes physically blacking out
[02:35:08.960 --> 02:35:12.160]  the transmission of his speech yeah it's interesting that the state of New York
[02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:16.960]  would issue an EAS alert over his filibuster right I have also seen on
[02:35:16.960 --> 02:35:20.560]  CNN but interesting he's doing that just to interrupt things but you know why
[02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:27.640]  wouldn't the Obama just say okay we're not gonna kill Americans on US soil why
[02:35:27.640 --> 02:35:31.560]  wouldn't he just be willing to put that language in there if that's what he's
[02:35:31.560 --> 02:35:34.800]  claiming he's never gonna do oh well look at the whole structure they've
[02:35:34.800 --> 02:35:39.320]  created the new terrorists could be a domestic extremist might be a returning
[02:35:39.320 --> 02:35:43.000]  vet might just be a crazy constitutionalist with a flag might just be a
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.960]  curmudgeoning old man with a shotgun who doesn't want government putting in a
[02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:51.120]  Spartan meter or something hey it might be an eight-year-old student with the
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:55.160]  strawberry tart shaped like a gun is that's most dangerous actually we're
[02:35:55.160 --> 02:35:59.280]  about to get to a special report at the very end oh really caught a very young
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:03.960]  terrorist still in a stroller without a bubble gun that's work out he was just
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:08.600]  rapid-firing he had bubbles he had hundreds of bubble bullets in his
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:13.020]  chambers does the TSA allow bubble guns on airplanes anymore or ever that's
[02:36:13.020 --> 02:36:17.760]  probably liquid right I doubt oh that's a liquid the bubbles plus it might look
[02:36:17.760 --> 02:36:21.480]  like something you know yeah like bubbles well I'm really worried about
[02:36:21.480 --> 02:36:25.600]  the strawberry tart guns because they could shoot strawberry seeds which I I
[02:36:25.600 --> 02:36:30.840]  understand are quite small and could poke out an eye and it's part of this
[02:36:30.840 --> 02:36:36.040]  whole Orwellian 1984 big brother system where the perception is reality and
[02:36:36.040 --> 02:36:41.360]  everyone has to tattle on each other and yeah basically even the thought they
[02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:45.880]  had literal everything but literal invasion of the mind but any sign that
[02:36:45.880 --> 02:36:49.000]  you're thinking of resistance that itself is a crime that's a thought crime
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.160]  well that gets us to the issue of mental hygiene yeah which we mentioned that in
[02:36:53.160 --> 02:36:57.520]  the first hour freak me out but yeah go ahead mental hygiene but that is one of
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:01.080]  the key code words from the eugenics movement it goes back to the founding
[02:37:01.080 --> 02:37:05.520]  but basically they wanted to use the idea that there's crazy people and they
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:09.600]  might be reproducing faster than regular people no only unfit people what
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:14.000]  they called feeble minded people oh but most of this was code word of course
[02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:17.880]  there were some messed up people but they really want an excuse for the state
[02:37:17.880 --> 02:37:21.800]  to decide who lives and dies which really brings us up to modern-day
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:26.360]  socialized health care where they want to rationalize it and say well your end
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:30.240]  of life care might cost a million dollars plus that's not worth it your life
[02:37:30.240 --> 02:37:34.520]  isn't a value so we want to terminate you that abortions to a minority mother
[02:37:34.520 --> 02:37:38.400]  or someone who already has too many children so that life isn't worth it
[02:37:38.400 --> 02:37:43.160]  and that's very much the mentality of eugenics but it itself is part of what
[02:37:43.160 --> 02:37:48.100]  George Orwell actually calls oligarchical collectivism remember Goldstein the
[02:37:48.100 --> 02:37:52.400]  rebel in 1984 who actually helped establish that big brother system he
[02:37:52.400 --> 02:37:56.480]  writes the book on the theory and practice of oligarchical collectivism
[02:37:56.480 --> 02:38:01.920]  and what this is is socialism in disguise have you ever heard of the Fabian
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:06.360]  society runs Fabian socialism yeah they have two logos one is the turtle for
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:11.120]  incrementalism the other is a wolf in sheep's clothing really and just check
[02:38:11.120 --> 02:38:15.200]  out one of the main of Fabian socialists who was also a eugenicist was
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:19.480]  playwright George Bernard Shaw very famous for Pygmalion and some of his
[02:38:19.480 --> 02:38:23.440]  other works he wrote that under socialism which remembers any form of
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:27.800]  oligarchical collectivism run by the elites but where everyone's trapped in
[02:38:27.800 --> 02:38:33.840]  the society socialism you'd be forcibly fed clothed lodged taught and employed
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:36.840]  whether you liked it or not but if it were discovered you had not the
[02:38:36.840 --> 02:38:40.920]  character and industry to be worth all this trouble you might be executed in a
[02:38:40.920 --> 02:38:45.160]  kindly manner in a kindly manner and so that is that a drone strike system is
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:48.960]  that a new world order system in action I think the drone strikes are kindly
[02:38:48.960 --> 02:38:53.520]  because the missile arrives before you hear it therefore there is no fear
[02:38:53.520 --> 02:38:57.600]  involved because they fly faster than the speed of sound right so you're
[02:38:57.600 --> 02:39:02.160]  blown up before you can even sense it that's compassionate government oh it's
[02:39:02.160 --> 02:39:06.160]  compassionate yeah but just to get back into eugenics of mental hygiene you had
[02:39:06.160 --> 02:39:11.080]  the case in I believe 1927 where they were saying we have to sterilize these
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:15.880]  imbeciles these feeble-minded retarded minds who can't think for themselves and
[02:39:15.880 --> 02:39:20.200]  it was actually a Supreme Court ruling from Justice Oliver Winterholmes who
[02:39:20.200 --> 02:39:24.760]  wrote in the in the deciding principle at the time quote the principle that
[02:39:24.760 --> 02:39:29.680]  sustains compulsory vaccination is broad enough to cover cutting the
[02:39:29.680 --> 02:39:34.360]  fallopian tubes which of course is compulsory sterilization and he said
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:39.440]  say in that decision three generations of imbeciles is enough and that's
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:43.680]  completely in fitting with why they have established departments of health and
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:48.200]  mental hygiene which are implements of the eugenics movement wow and it
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:53.120]  completely fits in where the Rockefeller family pushed all the vehicles for
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:58.080]  eugenics but also established our modern science and our modern hospitals and our
[02:39:58.080 --> 02:40:02.120]  modern health care system the allopathic medicine where you have to have
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:06.280]  surgeries and pharmaceuticals for everything staying away from anything
[02:40:06.280 --> 02:40:10.320]  that can't be trademarked and found in nature basically well if this eugenics
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:15.720]  effort was was thrust upon us you know many generations ago and it was so
[02:40:15.720 --> 02:40:22.480]  intense it seems like it didn't work because we we have more we have I mean
[02:40:22.480 --> 02:40:26.160]  we have it seems like the people running the country are now the most
[02:40:26.160 --> 02:40:30.280]  intellectually you know cognitively impaired of all it's like they got an
[02:40:30.280 --> 02:40:34.840]  instead of eugenics was saying they want to kill people who don't have high IQs
[02:40:34.840 --> 02:40:38.920]  but now it's like let's let's make them let's put them in office high IQs and
[02:40:38.920 --> 02:40:42.760]  mental capacity was the language of eugenics the actual system was about
[02:40:42.760 --> 02:40:46.880]  classifying people in this in the classes I mean they wanted to protect the
[02:40:46.880 --> 02:40:51.000]  elites and propagate their dominance right have an excuse to eliminate their
[02:40:51.000 --> 02:40:54.920]  competition and in particular many of them are racist and wanted to keep the
[02:40:54.920 --> 02:40:59.280]  black population down you later saw the population council the United Nations
[02:40:59.280 --> 02:41:03.960]  population fund doing really heavy-handed family planning in the
[02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:08.160]  third world where they do the most brutal things to people in India and
[02:41:08.160 --> 02:41:11.720]  China and all these other third world developing nations yeah you know North
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:14.760]  Korea will give you a nuclear family mm-hmm they're working they're working
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:19.480]  on that I know technology but listen yeah the main idea sorry I just have to
[02:41:19.480 --> 02:41:23.840]  I'm sorry I can't be serious today Aaron it's just it's too insane for me Alex
[02:41:23.840 --> 02:41:29.760]  goes the gallows humor but uh you know so what is what do you think from your
[02:41:29.760 --> 02:41:33.400]  research because you researched this more than anybody I know what is the
[02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:37.240]  ultimate mechanism for population control that they're gonna rain down upon
[02:41:37.240 --> 02:41:40.880]  us now or is it already here with GMOs and vaccines I think that's one of
[02:41:40.880 --> 02:41:44.600]  their main vehicles for sure the soft kill you've got technocrats like Bill
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.520]  Gates on the cutting edge of that he's pushing worldwide with mind you the
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:53.800]  Rockefeller Foundation they're working in lockstep to push vaccines
[02:41:53.800 --> 02:41:58.400]  everywhere some of which carry covert birth control maneuvers
[02:41:58.400 --> 02:42:02.800]  right remaining pregnancies causing miscarriages causing infertility and
[02:42:02.800 --> 02:42:07.840]  then he the other side he's pushing very heavy-handedly GMOs he's got major
[02:42:07.840 --> 02:42:12.600]  Monsanto stock companies like McDonald's and so forth are interlocked with his
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:17.600]  holdings and with the board of directors with Monsanto and that again works
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:21.640]  with Rockefeller who in the 70s created what they called the green revolution
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:26.760]  but it also centralized food production well you mentioned vaccines that the
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:31.480]  vaccines are birth control I mean vaccines are abortions they cause
[02:42:31.480 --> 02:42:37.000]  spontaneous abortions right and so do GMOs yeah in the rat studies that's fine
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.360]  right so the technologies isn't Bill Gates in town here in Austin right now
[02:42:41.360 --> 02:42:46.680]  that yeah he's here today for South by Southwest I think is he is he feeding
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:50.720]  people GMO what's he doing is he handing out cheeseburgers a lot of that him
[02:42:50.720 --> 02:42:54.680]  yeah yeah you know those elites they don't eat GMOs themselves they have
[02:42:54.680 --> 02:42:59.320]  they're very meticulous the Rockefeller family owns their own personal organic
[02:42:59.320 --> 02:43:03.240]  farm has their own personal organic chefs who prepare food and supply their
[02:43:03.240 --> 02:43:07.760]  personal family of food you find the same kind of thing with Chinese elites with
[02:43:07.760 --> 02:43:11.800]  the Queen the Royal families Bill Gates these people don't eat what they're
[02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:15.160]  pushing to the mainstream but that put that back on guys check this out here's
[02:43:15.160 --> 02:43:18.880]  the news Melissa Melton story on infowars.com Bill Gates descends on
[02:43:18.880 --> 02:43:24.120]  Austin in controlled pre-planned appearance well I mean versus what a
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:30.960]  spontaneous that's but Bill Gates is going to be at the Dell Computer Science
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:36.120]  Hall at the University of Texas speaking to students no doubt telling them to
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:41.360]  abort their babies with more vaccines well hey let's shift media because Alex
[02:43:41.360 --> 02:43:45.040]  really wanted me to get to the special report oh I'm sorry yeah go and go for it
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:49.480]  public events seeing National Guard Texas State Guard popping up all over the
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:43:52.800]  place they were at the kite festival which is otherwise this happy family
[02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:56.880]  event Alex Solomon at a Texas Independence Day celebration they'll do
[02:43:56.880 --> 02:44:01.320]  crowd control parking street control at different events and the question is why
[02:44:01.320 --> 02:44:05.320]  in the bottom line I tried to point out the history in the special report but
[02:44:05.320 --> 02:44:09.320]  they've perverted what was supposed to be our state militias and allowed them
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:13.840]  to be over federalized and used by the president and the centralized federalized
[02:44:13.840 --> 02:44:17.640]  government branch because they had one loophole in the Constitution for when
[02:44:17.640 --> 02:44:22.040]  you could use military domestically on our soil and that was to repel invasions
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:25.240]  and to put down insurrections they were thinking about things like the Shays
[02:44:25.240 --> 02:44:28.360]  rebellion that happened after the revolution but before the Constitution
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:33.480]  but in our modern day they perverted that loophole over insurrections and used
[02:44:33.480 --> 02:44:38.400]  it to be any national emergency natural disasters terrorism incidents hurricane
[02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:42.840]  so under u.s. North com and under laws they've passed including John Warner
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:47.760]  Defense Act since that time they've transformed more and more of the state
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:51.280]  guards as well as the National Guard into federal hands and allow the
[02:44:51.280 --> 02:44:56.320]  president to take total control okay let's let's roll it let's roll it Aaron
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:00.760]  Dykes here for info wars calm we've got to ask ourself why are the feds
[02:45:00.760 --> 02:45:05.200]  preparing for a war against Americans why have they bought now more than two
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:11.120]  billion bullets all kinds of arms and ammunition and now more than 2,700 tanks
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:15.240]  to patrol in America and keep order we're told it's because they love us
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:20.520]  we're told it's to keep the peace and to increase safety but of course we also
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:25.160]  know from army documents from Homeland Security reports and a lot of other
[02:45:25.160 --> 02:45:30.640]  information that it's really to occupy America and prepare for a civil unrest
[02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:35.200]  and a total economic collapse that will include gun confiscation gun confiscation
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:39.120]  is exactly what happened during the state of emergency following Hurricane
[02:45:39.120 --> 02:45:43.120]  Katrina in New Orleans now the founders who set up the Constitution and Bill of
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:47.160]  Rights did not want a standing army because they knew history and they knew
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:51.760]  that over and over again that's how power corrupts and takes over societies
[02:45:51.760 --> 02:45:55.640]  at the same time they were concerned about historical examples like the
[02:45:55.640 --> 02:45:59.480]  Shays rebellion that happened after the years of the revolution but before the
[02:45:59.480 --> 02:46:04.520]  Constitution where soldiers who weren't paid formed mobs to try to take over the
[02:46:04.520 --> 02:46:08.360]  government so they put in the possibility for the army to be used
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:13.280]  domestically for only one purpose and that's to put down insurrections this
[02:46:13.280 --> 02:46:18.480]  was strengthened through things like Posse commentatus from 1878 strictly
[02:46:18.480 --> 02:46:23.320]  forbidding military from working with police or doing domestic operations but
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:27.960]  that is whittled away in recent years and there's been a concerted effort to do
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:33.200]  away with Posse commentatus all together and to take away the state's power over
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:37.240]  troops and national guards and put all the power in the hands of the feds
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:41.360]  Homeland Security and the Department of Defense we've of course seen how the
[02:46:41.360 --> 02:46:46.120]  military has been drilling preparing and training to take on Americans put them
[02:46:46.120 --> 02:46:50.360]  in internment camps and otherwise occupy the domestic sphere of society
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:55.720]  Alex documented as early as his police state 2000 film and in many of his other
[02:46:55.720 --> 02:46:59.680]  films here's a short clip where Americans come to checkpoints and beg for
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:02.600]  help from the military
[02:47:02.600 --> 02:47:04.600]  I
[02:47:23.640 --> 02:47:27.840]  But it's a no way limit to the things that Alex has just put in his films this
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:31.960]  has been an ongoing effort that has been accelerating David Knight did a
[02:47:31.960 --> 02:47:36.840]  special report just a few weeks ago documenting only a few of the recent
[02:47:36.840 --> 02:47:41.840]  urban warfare drills many of which included helicopters firing simulated
[02:47:41.840 --> 02:47:48.400]  live rounds over major American cities they include Houston Miami Minneapolis
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:54.120]  St. Louis Chicago Los Angeles and other locales well let's take a look at some
[02:47:54.120 --> 02:47:58.360]  of these recent drills January the 28th in Houston helicopters and the sound of
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:02.240]  gunfire created a lot of concern this afternoon in one Houston neighborhood
[02:48:02.240 --> 02:48:05.740]  and an army major who was out here wouldn't tell us exactly what kind of
[02:48:05.740 --> 02:48:11.160]  training they were doing Miami four days earlier January the 24th 2013 still
[02:48:11.160 --> 02:48:14.760]  if you've seen one of these drills it really is like a scene out of one of
[02:48:14.760 --> 02:48:19.120]  those action movies choppers stalking this guy in downtown Miami it's a joint
[02:48:19.120 --> 02:48:23.160]  military training exercise here's another one in Minneapolis August 28th
[02:48:23.160 --> 02:48:28.040]  2012 if you see military helicopters flying low over Minneapolis
[02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:32.480]  do not be alarmed they are training in an urban environment here's another one
[02:48:32.480 --> 02:48:38.720]  st. Louis July 3rd 2012 it's a military mission in north st. Louis heavily
[02:48:38.720 --> 02:48:42.800]  armored vehicles are rolling into town and while they come in peace there are
[02:48:42.800 --> 02:48:49.520]  all kinds of rumors about why they are here Chicago April 17th 2012 a pretty
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:53.360]  scary scene along the Chicago River turns out to be a military training
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:49:00.520]  exercise Los Angeles in January the 26th 2012 special military operation
[02:49:00.520 --> 02:49:05.160]  forces in conjunction with the LAPD conducting some military maneuvers of
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:10.280]  course in the 2010 film police state for the rise of FEMA Rob do Alex Jones and
[02:49:10.280 --> 02:49:14.080]  the other filmmakers covered the example of Arcadia Iowa where in the
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:19.240]  National Guard practice cordon and search drills in neighborhoods to
[02:49:19.240 --> 02:49:24.080]  specifically take on gun dealers to find quote weapons caches and Alex
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:27.760]  interviewed the officer who was in charge of the drill they were admittedly
[02:49:27.760 --> 02:49:32.200]  doing it for domestic purposes inside the United States and we should really
[02:49:32.200 --> 02:49:36.400]  ask ourselves why it says in this article going door-to-door asking if
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:40.600]  they could search homes looking for weapons it's actually a plan training
[02:49:40.600 --> 02:49:45.840]  event to provide our soldiers with greater proficiency at what we call
[02:49:45.840 --> 02:49:51.120]  cordon and search which is a mission that just for a little background we've
[02:49:51.120 --> 02:49:55.680]  deployed nearly 13,000 members of the Iowa National Guard in the global war on
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:50:00.280]  terror and then actually search for caches of weapons or other kinds of
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:05.280]  contraband which could harm American forces like Fallujah what we saw in
[02:50:05.280 --> 02:50:12.320]  Fallujah correct and then you have manuals like FM 3-39.40 specifically
[02:50:12.320 --> 02:50:17.520]  about internment and resettlement and they include the presence of Cyop
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:22.520]  officers to win over the support of the American people and of course to deal
[02:50:22.520 --> 02:50:25.560]  with dissidents and this happens throughout history every time an
[02:50:25.560 --> 02:50:29.840]  oppressive power takes over the Nazis of course didn't only come in with a
[02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:34.240]  strong military force they first said in what equates to Cyop officers
[02:50:34.240 --> 02:50:39.280]  psychological operators who tried to win over public support they offered
[02:50:39.280 --> 02:50:43.040]  children candy they told them they were there to help they did friendly public
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:47.640]  events and we see this playing out again in American society unfortunately
[02:50:47.640 --> 02:50:51.240]  where National Guard military troops who aren't supposed to operate
[02:50:51.240 --> 02:50:55.920]  domestically are operating outside of their role but in benign ways that
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:51:02.560]  innocuous events to win over public support and this too if you're listening

[02:54:38.000 --> 02:54:42.760]  this is the scene of the Austin Kite Festival now in its eighty fourth year
[02:54:42.760 --> 02:54:48.960]  an iconic and idyllic scene of peace and recreation what could be better but
[02:54:48.960 --> 02:54:52.800]  outside of this festive atmosphere which had clogged downtown traffic and
[02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:57.360]  brought normal activities on this happy weekend day to a halt was a military
[02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:02.080]  presence the Texas State Guard operating under the National Guard was
[02:55:02.080 --> 02:55:05.800]  running part of the event they were invited there by the Austin Exchange
[02:55:05.800 --> 02:55:10.300]  Club and operated with the help of police the shuttle buses bringing kite
[02:55:10.300 --> 02:55:15.000]  festival goers to and from the event it was admittedly run as other training
[02:55:15.000 --> 02:55:19.960]  exercises are in preparation for natural disasters and other emergencies as
[02:55:19.960 --> 02:55:24.460]  coordinated by Homeland Security and FEMA including this article posted on the
[02:55:24.460 --> 02:55:29.560]  Texas State Guard website TXSG flies high with Austin Kite Festival where
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:33.040]  they admit in part that festival organizers and participants gave the
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:36.920]  Texas State Guard soldiers real-world training for the kind of logistical
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:41.000]  support the organization provides during natural disasters and other
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.040]  emergencies quote this gives us the opportunity to put our training and
[02:55:45.040 --> 02:55:49.600]  expertise into practical use in advance of a response to hurricanes tornadoes
[02:55:49.600 --> 02:55:54.640]  floods or fires the National Guard first appeared in 2012 at the Austin
[02:55:54.640 --> 02:55:59.040]  Kite Festival provoking several news articles the internet was ablaze with
[02:55:59.040 --> 02:56:02.560]  the account of the National Guard patrolling the Austin Kite Festival in
[02:56:02.560 --> 02:56:08.320]  2012 but here in 2013 there is scant mention of the National Guard's presence
[02:56:08.320 --> 02:56:11.920]  other than just straightforward PR releases of how they would operate the
[02:56:11.920 --> 02:56:15.600]  buses and how they would carry passengers to and fro conditioning the
[02:56:15.600 --> 02:56:20.240]  public to accept ever greater control in violation of posse commentatus to keep
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:24.440]  track and control of the people under any pretext they considered necessary
[02:56:24.440 --> 02:56:29.000]  Homeland Security and FEMA have made big preparations not only for natural
[02:56:29.000 --> 02:56:33.960]  disasters but also for civil unrest or declared national emergencies and their
[02:56:33.960 --> 02:56:37.680]  training exercises have routinely included the very functions that these
[02:56:37.680 --> 02:56:41.600]  National Guard members were carrying out during this kite festival where they
[02:56:41.600 --> 02:56:45.320]  would line up the public and keep track of them as they were loaded onto buses
[02:56:45.320 --> 02:56:50.560]  in 2011 info wars reporters traveled to Denver Colorado to cover an exercise
[02:56:50.560 --> 02:56:54.760]  run by Homeland Security and FEMA where various terror scenarios and school
[02:56:54.760 --> 02:56:58.800]  shooter scenarios prompted school buses to load children and take them to
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:03.240]  sports stadiums contingency plans for natural disasters and other emergencies
[02:57:03.240 --> 02:57:07.920]  have included in states like Texas and New Jersey RFID wristbands where
[02:57:07.920 --> 02:57:11.640]  members of the population would be tracked and tagged upon entering buses
[02:57:11.640 --> 02:57:16.000]  and throughout their stay at emergency centers like the one used by FEMA during
[02:57:16.000 --> 02:57:19.560]  Hurricane Katrina at the Superdome where the public was not protected but
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:23.560]  instead subjected to a laboratory of martial law conditions while there is
[02:57:23.560 --> 02:57:27.400]  no sign of this kind of disaster at the Austin Kite Festival I guess it's good
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:31.000]  that military and police were there to keep order I actually captured a very
[02:57:31.000 --> 02:57:34.960]  dangerous individual on this camera seen here at a young age in a stroller
[02:57:34.960 --> 02:57:42.600]  using a terrorist weapon the bubble gun and there you go that's the video report
[02:57:42.600 --> 02:57:47.800]  from Aaron Dykes and you can continue to watch the whole thing at info wars.com
[02:57:47.800 --> 02:57:51.160]  troops deployed ahead of economic collapse and gun confiscation an
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:54.400]  outstanding report there from Aaron Dykes and he was showing us the terror
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:59.960]  weapon bubble gun that shoots little bubbles held by a child if you can
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:03.560]  believe that oh my goodness and that's not even allowed on airplanes as we
[02:58:03.560 --> 02:58:07.600]  talked about in any case the big stories today North Korea vows to cancel the
[02:58:07.600 --> 02:58:13.440]  Korean Korean War ceasefire we've got the mental hygiene in Maryland we've got
