[02:36.340 --> 02:40.660]  new functions we're going to be launching in the info war as we intensify
[02:40.660 --> 02:44.460]  our operations against the globalist we not only stay hungry in the fight for
[02:44.460 --> 02:49.060]  liberty we get hungrier and hungrier and do more and more and I couldn't do it
[02:49.060 --> 02:56.740]  without my great crew here we are also going to open the phones up today there
[02:56.740 --> 03:06.820]  are three articles up at info wars.com today dealing with our very informative
[03:06.820 --> 03:11.940]  interview with Congressman Ron Paul yesterday one of the major presidential
[03:11.940 --> 03:16.580]  contenders on the Republican Party side and every major study that's been done
[03:16.580 --> 03:20.220]  you can pull them up shows he is the most likely to be able to beat Barack
[03:20.220 --> 03:27.300]  Obama Ron Paul feds preparing for breakdown of law and order I was able to
[03:27.300 --> 03:31.340]  confirm his views that he gave Robert Wannick reporter a few weeks ago at the
[03:31.340 --> 03:38.060]  Iowa Ames straw poll that he was a statistical tie with Bachman who bought
[03:38.060 --> 03:44.220]  90% plus of her votes and he I brought up the FEMA centers and he agreed that
[03:44.220 --> 03:48.500]  they're preparing for collapse because they understand what's happening in the
[03:48.500 --> 03:53.420]  economy because they've engineered it and I said but to be clear you're saying
[03:53.420 --> 03:59.340]  they want to use that collapse to gain more control and he said absolutely so
[03:59.340 --> 04:03.620]  that is the first big report at info wars.com very important to get out to
[04:03.620 --> 04:09.620]  everybody also Ron Paul CIA chooses dictators around the world he further
[04:09.620 --> 04:13.700]  fleshed out his comment to a Liberty Committee meeting where he said the CIA
[04:13.700 --> 04:18.420]  had a coup in America and they ship in the drugs continuing there's another
[04:18.420 --> 04:24.140]  article by Curt Nimo Rick Perry globalist in Patriot clothing that was
[04:24.140 --> 04:27.220]  the original headline working with her this morning I gave him but after I
[04:27.220 --> 04:31.820]  looked at it I thought look at that quote from Ron Paul in Kurt's article
[04:31.820 --> 04:36.380]  it says Ron Paul Rick Perry is a flip-flopper I think that's a good point
[04:36.380 --> 04:40.020]  there and Ron Paul normally doesn't even speak out against his opposition he
[04:40.020 --> 04:43.300]  just stands for what he stands for but because Rick Perry is trying to become
[04:43.300 --> 04:48.580]  him it's very very important that Ron Paul point out that he's the real McCoy
[04:48.580 --> 04:54.740]  and that Rick Perry is a cheap attempt to basically dress somebody up like Ronald
[04:54.740 --> 04:59.820]  Reagan who talks like Ron Paul we'll be right back stay with us
[05:00.620 --> 05:05.380]  hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot

[06:03.180 --> 06:07.500]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[06:07.500 --> 06:11.700]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[06:11.700 --> 06:15.740]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[06:15.740 --> 06:19.620]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[06:19.620 --> 06:23.620]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[06:23.620 --> 06:28.020]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[06:28.020 --> 06:32.340]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[06:32.340 --> 06:36.060]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[06:36.060 --> 06:40.260]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[06:40.260 --> 06:43.620]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[08:08.940 --> 08:30.180]  Jones and the GCN radio network here we are the first day of September 2011 and
[08:30.180 --> 08:36.100]  in just eight and a half days it'll be ten years since the attacks that changed
[08:36.100 --> 08:41.340]  America forever I tried our country's been attacked many many times but there
[08:41.340 --> 08:45.820]  was never a move to abolish the entire Bill of Rights and Constitution and say
[08:45.820 --> 08:49.820]  that tyranny would keep us safe when everyone who studied history knows
[08:49.820 --> 08:58.860]  tyranny is the greatest danger in any society in any civilization now I want
[08:58.860 --> 09:04.540]  to go over some of the news just give you a brief rundown on what's coming up
[09:04.540 --> 09:08.900]  here on the radio today and some of the guests that are coming up and then we're
[09:08.900 --> 09:12.820]  going to open the phones up because I do want to take a lot of your phone calls
[09:12.820 --> 09:21.740]  here on the broadcast today but some of the news we have here jobless claims are
[09:21.740 --> 09:30.540]  stuck above four hundred thousand a month productivity is falling and this is
[09:30.540 --> 09:35.220]  the Wall Street Journal but remember that the government numbers they're
[09:35.220 --> 09:42.380]  using themselves are cooked and so they're admitting that the economy is
[09:42.380 --> 09:48.700]  in a deep recession never left the recession Geithner has called it the
[09:48.700 --> 09:56.020]  greatest recession and even though they're doing stealth QE 3 and other
[09:56.020 --> 10:02.740]  forms of debt monetization this country and in fact the entire global system is
[10:02.740 --> 10:07.500]  in the stranglehold of the globalist that's what globalism is is a financial
[10:07.500 --> 10:13.060]  global directorate designed to destroy sovereign nations the family the individual
[10:13.060 --> 10:17.500]  it's all about conquering you and putting you into an artificial environment
[10:17.500 --> 10:23.220]  an artificial habitat like you're at the zoo artificial cultures artificial
[10:23.220 --> 10:30.020]  media artificial food artificial information in fact here's just a
[10:30.020 --> 10:34.620]  quick example driving in today I was listening to local news radio and I'm
[10:34.620 --> 10:37.540]  actually going to print these articles off later and get into it if I remember
[10:37.540 --> 10:47.580]  but I heard two different news items during the news program and one of them
[10:47.580 --> 10:59.420]  was oh my gosh the state has passed a law saying that the school can spank
[10:59.420 --> 11:05.420]  your child and then the news reporter was saying how can this be in the news
[11:05.420 --> 11:14.580]  they're playing clips of people saying parents can't spank children but the
[11:14.580 --> 11:24.860]  government can and it was wrong on so many fronts so many facets and sure
[11:24.860 --> 11:30.500]  enough they then went into the news talk program and the third caller gave them
[11:30.500 --> 11:38.460]  the Texas penal code that I've looked up and it says a parent or a guardian
[11:38.460 --> 11:44.540]  under state law and it's the same in every other state can will and should use
[11:44.540 --> 11:49.660]  corporal punishment if needed to maintain safety and order do you think
[11:49.660 --> 11:55.340]  schools when I was in public school 20 something years ago do you think they
[11:55.340 --> 12:00.780]  have I did something wrong or was even late to class too many times with
[12:00.780 --> 12:05.060]  calling into the principal's office and take out a paddle do you think they were
[12:05.060 --> 12:15.060]  doing that without there being a law it's the penal code but you see the news
[12:15.060 --> 12:22.180]  going along with the hoax that it is illegal for parents to spank their
[12:22.180 --> 12:30.100]  children it is illegal for you to do serious bodily harm break a bone knock
[12:30.100 --> 12:36.100]  out a tooth that's assault well then you have to ask the question why then
[12:36.100 --> 12:41.140]  regardless of which side of this debate you're on do you know and it's in the
[12:41.140 --> 12:46.740]  news about the tens of thousands of child protective services cases every
[12:46.740 --> 12:51.340]  year where they take people's children you see it on the news or a woman in
[12:51.340 --> 12:55.860]  target spanks her daughter who's throwing fits and breaking things just
[12:55.860 --> 13:02.420]  gives her a few spats and the police are called she's arrested and the child is
[13:02.420 --> 13:10.100]  taken and in many cases drug off rape given STDs cries for mama that's mental
[13:10.100 --> 13:15.060]  illness put on psychotropic drugs and the kids beg to see mommy and never see
[13:15.060 --> 13:18.140]  her again and that's normally what happens although those spoiled brat
[13:18.140 --> 13:25.540]  children find out real quick the social engineers on record the American
[13:25.540 --> 13:30.780]  Pediatric Association the Psychiatric Association the Psychology Association
[13:30.780 --> 13:36.620]  they all the last sixty seventy years have come out and said don't spank so
[13:36.620 --> 13:42.580]  that parents cease to be parents and so the state can now come in and be the
[13:42.580 --> 13:47.020]  parent and the children get out of control they get into crime they go to
[13:47.020 --> 13:54.660]  juvenile hall they get baptized in corruption and now the police taser
[13:54.660 --> 14:01.380]  them to keep control of them or shoot them what do you do when a child can't
[14:01.380 --> 14:04.020]  be reasoned with and is three years old and keeps trying to run out the street
[14:04.020 --> 14:08.140]  the third time you spank them because they don't understand the car can kill
[14:08.140 --> 14:13.660]  them but they do understand that there's a bad effect when they try to turn the
[14:13.660 --> 14:17.100]  stove on for the third time in a row when they try to stick a piece of metal
[14:17.100 --> 14:22.780]  in the light socket for the third time when they climb on the counter for the
[14:22.780 --> 14:28.780]  third time and try to pull out butcher knives as children do when they try to
[14:28.780 --> 14:33.700]  go in the garage and see what's in the gasoline tank for the third time they
[14:33.700 --> 14:42.500]  want to destroy law and order so yes in the name of allowing spanking and
[14:42.500 --> 14:48.460]  corporal punishment schools they passed a law restricting the right of the
[14:48.460 --> 14:51.620]  independent school district which I don't like government training centers and I
[14:51.620 --> 14:55.100]  wouldn't put my child in them but some people don't have a choice and if you're
[14:55.100 --> 14:59.540]  going to put them in there they've got to maintain order but see instead in a
[14:59.540 --> 15:03.580]  few areas in Illinois and New York where they do not have corporal punishment
[15:03.580 --> 15:10.540]  dodgeball is not allowed either because it's seen as aggressive that's where they
[15:10.540 --> 15:12.780]  have the shootings that's where the teachers are getting attacked that's
[15:12.780 --> 15:17.220]  where your kids are being beaten up that's where there's absolutely no
[15:17.220 --> 15:21.820]  control but then if there's a little fistfight or a scuffle or even kids
[15:21.820 --> 15:26.780]  shake hands not allowed many schools the police are called see instead of being
[15:26.780 --> 15:31.100]  run around the track till you throw up or being given a few painful pops that
[15:31.100 --> 15:36.540]  don't hurt you physically but sure sting instead of that happening oh no you're
[15:36.540 --> 15:43.700]  just going to go to a jail cell when you're 13 and they're 17 year olds in
[15:43.700 --> 15:47.420]  there they're going to take you in the shower and they're going to rape you and
[15:47.420 --> 15:51.860]  they're going to give you STDs and that's what goes on every day remember the
[15:51.860 --> 15:55.140]  Texas Youth Commission where they were organizing gladiatory fights for the
[15:55.140 --> 15:58.660]  police in them where there was STDs being spread everywhere where they were
[15:58.660 --> 16:03.300]  caught selling the young children to government officials and others that
[16:03.300 --> 16:07.220]  would actually come to the facilities yeah your child instead because you don't
[16:07.220 --> 16:11.940]  want to discipline them they're just going to get out of control it's just
[16:11.940 --> 16:18.500]  like with dogs dog and human psychology is very similar you don't you don't have
[16:18.500 --> 16:23.580]  to really spank a puppy heart at all it's just the newspaper when they don't
[16:23.580 --> 16:31.300]  go on the newspapers you've laid down or when they don't wait to go outside you
[16:31.300 --> 16:37.020]  tell them no and you spat them with that and it's the it's the psychology of
[16:37.020 --> 16:42.540]  this is a bad thing I need to do what you're saying but I know I watch the
[16:42.540 --> 16:46.020]  quote trendy liberals they're not liberals at all what they are is people
[16:46.020 --> 16:49.580]  that allow themselves to be programmed and have the natural order run out of
[16:49.580 --> 16:53.900]  them so they could be totally controlled in society can be brought down you'll
[16:53.900 --> 16:57.340]  always know liberals at a dog part with their dogs they're out of control they're
[16:57.340 --> 17:00.780]  yelling at their dog their dogs jumping up and down going crazy biting other
[17:00.780 --> 17:04.860]  dogs you can't go to a movie with your children and not watch the liberals come
[17:04.860 --> 17:08.460]  in and just gripe at their kids and get in their face and needle them and
[17:08.460 --> 17:12.540]  psychologically mess with them and peck at them and and I mean I had to leave a
[17:12.540 --> 17:15.500]  movie a month ago with my children because in the ten minutes before these
[17:15.500 --> 17:19.740]  people were these these these socialists were in front of me and I heard enough to
[17:19.740 --> 17:22.940]  then hear that actually were basically socialists and they had like this three
[17:22.940 --> 17:27.020]  year old daughter they were totally screwing up just needling her and
[17:27.020 --> 17:31.660]  telling her this and that and you and guaranteed they don't discipline her
[17:31.660 --> 17:36.300]  these these are mentally ill people they've taken control of our society
[17:36.300 --> 17:42.460]  they've totally wrecked it and they love it now I'm gonna go to the news your
[17:42.460 --> 17:50.300]  calls it's just that to hear the news say it's illegal for parents to spank
[17:50.300 --> 17:54.980]  their children to then hear the show go live and hear the host say it and then
[17:54.980 --> 17:58.900]  the third caller right as I pulled in I was sitting in the car waiting on
[17:58.900 --> 18:02.580]  to somebody know this he called in and he read out the penal code in fact I
[18:02.580 --> 18:11.260]  forget it it's nine point something Texas Texas penal code on on parent
[18:11.260 --> 18:15.940]  spanking and then it'll come up for you and it says right there the parent the
[18:15.940 --> 18:21.300]  guardian whoever under law under common law if you give your child to your
[18:21.300 --> 18:29.860]  cousin to your parents to a school to a church I mean that was the old thing of
[18:29.860 --> 18:34.180]  if kids got doing something wrong the whoever caught them would spank them the
[18:34.180 --> 18:39.020]  police would spank them when you got home the parents would spank them well
[18:39.020 --> 18:41.980]  then there's the whole thing of don't lay a hand on my child so the police are
[18:41.980 --> 18:45.100]  just gonna stand back when your kids throwing a fit and taser them they can
[18:45.100 --> 18:50.580]  dive a heart attack from that and law and order has gone out the window and so
[18:50.580 --> 18:54.340]  now parents have to sign this form saying you can use corporal punishment
[18:54.340 --> 18:58.860]  and I heard teachers on the air saying look it's the a lot of times the

[19:03.140 --> 19:10.220]  always the trouble kids that the parents to say don't lay a hand on my child
[19:11.460 --> 19:15.460]  that's just the way it is because they're not discipline in their children
[19:15.460 --> 19:26.500]  either they bought into the system yeah that's a boil down of overall state laws
[19:26.500 --> 19:29.820]  abuse does not include reasonable discipline by a parent guardian
[19:29.820 --> 19:37.780]  managing or possessory conservator if child not exposed substantial risk of

[25:06.100 --> 25:11.420]  agrees that it's a great concern that he was Al Gore's chief of staff in Texas
[25:11.420 --> 25:18.020]  praise Hillary Clinton care in 1993 and more but mainline Republicans love to
[25:18.020 --> 25:22.360]  get chumped and they they don't know who they like better Rick Perry or Mitt
[25:22.360 --> 25:26.500]  Romney they're like whoa you wrote Obamacare we like that wow you're for

[25:50.060 --> 25:57.420]  issue of corporal punishment there's a continuum are there drunken degenerate
[25:57.420 --> 26:04.940]  thug type people who have children in their trash and beat their children and
[26:04.940 --> 26:09.940]  should get in trouble well yes and what happens is your family or neighbors call
[26:09.940 --> 26:13.580]  and the police come and your child's got a broken arm and they arrest daddy and
[26:13.580 --> 26:19.860]  daddy goes to jail for a couple years for it and then you're left with mama
[26:19.860 --> 26:24.260]  and grandma on the rest of them but in around 1910 or so depending on the state
[26:24.260 --> 26:28.460]  they set up you've got another roots of things don't just report a new story we
[26:28.460 --> 26:33.980]  give you history of it they set up a British model in the US called eugenics
[26:33.980 --> 26:40.140]  racial hygiene it targeted blacks whites everybody particularly whites because
[26:40.140 --> 26:43.620]  they were concerned about bad genetics in the precious you know Aryan gene pool
[26:43.620 --> 26:48.660]  and Hitler wrote many in his publications that his Bible was a
[26:48.660 --> 26:52.380]  different American eugenicist and people like Margaret Sanger whose praise is
[26:52.380 --> 26:56.460]  liberal and she said we've got to pose as liberals to get blacks to trust us
[26:56.460 --> 26:59.980]  we're gonna get kill these weeds and I've brought that up to mainline liberals
[26:59.980 --> 27:05.020]  and they go so what hmm see that's why they all tell you they want to fight
[27:05.020 --> 27:08.940]  racism and they want to be your friend what they want to do is get you in an
[27:08.940 --> 27:12.820]  inner city pay the mama not to have the man in the home so they can put the
[27:12.820 --> 27:19.420]  males in prison and go from 20% of blacks 50 years ago about 21% having a
[27:19.420 --> 27:26.580]  criminal record to 94% now and 91% illegitimacy how'd that great society do
[27:26.580 --> 27:30.100]  for you but don't worry they're moving that on to every other group of people
[27:30.100 --> 27:35.740]  they've got whites from less than 5% illegitimacy to over 50 now you're like
[27:35.740 --> 27:40.780]  don't you bash single parents not bashing single parents there's a lot of
[27:40.780 --> 27:45.820]  great hard work and single parents and things happen the issue here is this
[27:45.820 --> 27:50.500]  that you're four times more likely to be a drug abuser and to end up being
[27:50.500 --> 27:54.180]  homeless and have big problems if you're from a single parent home you're
[27:54.180 --> 28:00.140]  three times more likely to end up doing hard time I'm talking felony time in the
[28:00.140 --> 28:04.740]  big house look it up some numbers are even higher the point is it isn't good
[28:04.740 --> 28:08.980]  two parents have trouble even if they know what they're doing controlling
[28:08.980 --> 28:13.780]  strong-willed children and if you care about them you'll make them work you'll
[28:13.780 --> 28:17.060]  make them cook dinner you'll make them clean the house you'll make them plant
[28:17.060 --> 28:20.860]  a garden and they'll start to enjoy it by the way I haven't done a perfect job
[28:20.860 --> 28:26.180]  of my children I I learned what what all the old-timers said from experience you
[28:26.180 --> 28:30.460]  you let them be lazy you start getting problems as soon as you start getting on
[28:30.460 --> 28:37.140]  them then they're a lot happier just like a dog you don't train a puppy it's
[28:37.140 --> 28:40.860]  going to be absolutely miserable and have a horrible life you train it it's
[28:40.860 --> 28:46.820]  going to be happier smarter people are gonna like it it's I mean I challenge
[28:46.820 --> 28:51.860]  you a study should be done at dog parks go ask people are you a conservative or
[28:51.860 --> 28:55.580]  you a liberal have a mark down a note and observe them for a month when they
[28:55.580 --> 28:58.940]  come to the dog park and I'm telling you when liberals on average have animals
[28:58.940 --> 29:05.420]  it is because they're so nice they let the dog bite your dog they let their
[29:05.420 --> 29:09.060]  dog act weird they let their dog urinate on their carpet they let the dog run
[29:09.060 --> 29:14.980]  off and get run over by a car they don't understand any basic laws of
[29:14.980 --> 29:20.460]  anything because they were taught to be rudderless by the social engineers so
[29:20.460 --> 29:26.860]  they set up the eugenics systems and then they sent out the social workers and
[29:26.860 --> 29:30.340]  if you were poor they just took your kids if you made lower than a b-plus they
[29:30.340 --> 29:33.460]  took your kids that's in my film in game government and newsreels in
[29:33.460 --> 29:37.740]  menningen saying it's good they would sterilize you and so that's all it is
[29:37.740 --> 29:41.940]  now their new way to get your kids is to say your neighbors saw you spank them
[29:41.940 --> 29:45.980]  and the parents are dumb and wave their rights and sign a form you didn't
[29:45.980 --> 29:50.340]  commit a crime these aren't criminal courts I'll explain it we're on the
[29:50.340 --> 30:05.180]  march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network tyranny is

[32:58.100 --> 33:07.700]  end of america three dot com
[33:28.500 --> 33:49.380]  you know what's hard about being awake and informed you listen to yourself and
[33:49.380 --> 33:56.020]  you say that's going to be taken the wrong way because people are so
[33:56.020 --> 34:01.940]  incredibly ignorant i'm ignorant too but i'm trying to be informed you know
[34:01.940 --> 34:06.500]  there's a big difference there when i get up here and i say liberals are a
[34:06.500 --> 34:12.740]  bunch of gibbering moron idiots i'm not talking about some organic farmer who
[34:12.740 --> 34:17.460]  sees themselves as a liberal see it's all these labels thomas jefferson was a
[34:17.460 --> 34:23.140]  liberal but a thomas jefferson is diametrically opposed to what a liberal
[34:23.140 --> 34:26.500]  is today i'm talking about these people
[34:26.500 --> 34:33.380]  that are scared of snakes scared of guns scared of the countryside scared of
[34:33.380 --> 34:37.940]  cows scared of everything that they they're
[34:37.940 --> 34:42.500]  scared of everything but things that they shouldn't
[34:43.220 --> 34:46.980]  be scared of what i'm saying is they're scared of things that they
[34:46.980 --> 34:49.780]  really shouldn't be that scared of and then things that they should be scared
[34:49.780 --> 34:54.820]  of they have no basic instincts of understanding no government big
[34:54.820 --> 35:00.020]  powerful groups getting together that's what can really destroy societies and
[35:00.020 --> 35:04.660]  kill a lot of people and enslave a lot of people and humiliate a lot of people
[35:04.660 --> 35:09.700]  and turn great societies into very sour societies
[35:09.700 --> 35:14.020]  so i'm listening to the newscast and then i'm like that's incredible that they
[35:14.020 --> 35:18.020]  just said it's against the law to spank your children
[35:18.020 --> 35:21.860]  and because i knew the texas penal code and it's the same it's all off
[35:21.860 --> 35:27.940]  english common law is that when you give your child to someone
[35:27.940 --> 35:36.580]  and see it's so alien that today that just 50 years ago people wouldn't
[35:36.580 --> 35:43.860]  bat an eyelash give the football coach gave
[35:43.860 --> 35:48.340]  10 pops to their son and if the son bowed up and hit the football coach and
[35:48.340 --> 35:51.860]  the football coach broke his jaw
[35:54.260 --> 35:58.900]  and quite frankly back in the old days if the if the teenager ended up beating
[35:58.900 --> 36:02.820]  up the coach everybody kind of bowed down to him
[36:04.020 --> 36:09.620]  i'm not going to tell any stories the point is is that
[36:09.620 --> 36:14.420]  we have gone from a manhood-based society to a scientific
[36:14.420 --> 36:19.780]  ninning society that is not altruistic and just failing and wrong
[36:19.780 --> 36:24.820]  it's designed to make us a bunch of weak jellyfish
[36:24.820 --> 36:29.220]  and so under common law when you give your child and that's in the penal
[36:29.220 --> 36:33.780]  codes go read it in every state when you give your
[36:33.780 --> 36:37.860]  child to anyone to be their guardian they now
[36:37.860 --> 36:44.580]  can use reasonable force to protect that child
[36:44.580 --> 36:49.860]  and to order that child and that reasonable force goes up
[36:49.860 --> 36:53.380]  child's throwing a fit throwing things around you can restrain them spank them
[36:53.380 --> 36:56.340]  whatever's needed the child starts attacking people with a
[36:56.340 --> 37:00.980]  weapon now you can defend yourself everything that the police
[37:00.980 --> 37:05.540]  operate under their rules all come out of common law
[37:05.540 --> 37:12.100]  and citizens arrest so when you the parent hand your child over
[37:12.100 --> 37:16.100]  to someone you under common law are giving
[37:16.100 --> 37:23.060]  guardianship over that child and that's why 200 years ago they would
[37:23.060 --> 37:27.060]  spank you in school it actually take you outside with a big
[37:27.060 --> 37:32.260]  old uh switch and bloody of if need be
[37:32.260 --> 37:35.940]  right through to when i was in high school
[37:35.940 --> 37:40.980]  20 years ago the last few years i didn't get any pops once i moved to austin
[37:40.980 --> 37:47.060]  but i was pretty rambunctious in Dallas and they didn't need to call my parents
[37:47.060 --> 37:51.860]  they didn't need to get permission they didn't need because it was common law
[37:51.860 --> 37:55.060]  now if you don't like your child being spanked
[37:55.060 --> 38:00.740]  don't put them in a place that does it
[38:00.740 --> 38:07.300]  you see you go under the common law the common sense law
[38:07.300 --> 38:14.420]  european ancient british law which itself came out of europe when you put
[38:14.420 --> 38:20.740]  your child in a school when you give your child to the ymca when you send
[38:20.740 --> 38:26.820]  your child on an away camp uh for basketball but see what
[38:26.820 --> 38:31.860]  they've done is they've taken all authority away
[38:31.860 --> 38:35.780]  now not only from the parents
[38:36.980 --> 38:40.900]  and again they haven't done this legally yet
[38:41.220 --> 38:47.860]  they've done it in the minds of the people and next they'll do it
[38:47.860 --> 38:53.700]  in the law but teachers are getting a tax stabbed
[38:53.700 --> 38:58.900]  you name it and cannot even restrain a student who's attacking another one
[38:58.900 --> 39:02.980]  they will be kicked out of school they will lose their teaching certificate
[39:02.980 --> 39:07.380]  the principal can't in many of these quote progressive schools
[39:07.380 --> 39:11.380]  progressing the globalist dehumanization
[39:11.380 --> 39:15.380]  they know what they're doing so society breaks down
[39:15.380 --> 39:19.460]  and only specialized enforcers are allowed to come in
[39:19.460 --> 39:22.340]  so instead of being run around the track instead of being
[39:22.340 --> 39:26.260]  swatted to what they call them getting swats or pops
[39:26.260 --> 39:31.620]  now the cops show up you throw a fit to them
[39:31.620 --> 39:38.900]  they taser you and why the system said well you might swing that baton wrong
[39:38.900 --> 39:43.460]  and statistically we get less lawsuits if you just send high voltage through them
[39:43.460 --> 39:49.060]  so the cop goes all right whatever you're still
[39:49.060 --> 39:53.380]  flopping around starting fights you're tasered then it sets the precedent taser
[39:53.380 --> 39:56.980]  people if you talk back to the police see now
[39:56.980 --> 40:00.740]  now they're in the wrong so they create a power
[40:00.740 --> 40:04.420]  vacuum they take it away from parents coaches
[40:04.420 --> 40:09.620]  teachers pastors boy scout leaders girl scout leaders
[40:09.620 --> 40:17.060]  and now the young people don't respect you in any mammal animal kingdom
[40:17.060 --> 40:22.180]  I've seen it even on the nature shows the seals going over to the whale
[40:22.180 --> 40:25.620]  breathing hole on the ice killer whales are hunting and eating them
[40:25.620 --> 40:28.660]  the mom barks at him comes over nudges him away
[40:28.660 --> 40:34.580]  goes over a second time she comes over and really barks at him and
[40:34.580 --> 40:38.820]  nibbles on him a little just kind of starts to bite him
[40:39.380 --> 40:42.900]  and it's the same instinct she does it further down his hind quarter away from
[40:42.900 --> 40:47.700]  the eyes don't want to hurt the baby seal she's trying to keep him
[40:47.700 --> 40:50.660]  from being killed
[40:52.260 --> 40:56.020]  seal goes over again to where the killer well said
[40:56.020 --> 41:00.900]  mama has seen hundreds of fellow seals eaten she knows the baby's instincts
[41:00.900 --> 41:04.580]  haven't kicked in yet she walks over with her teeth
[41:04.580 --> 41:09.300]  bites him he howls in anger like a spoiled eight-year-old
[41:09.300 --> 41:13.940]  hops away with blood dripping out of his tail
[41:14.580 --> 41:20.020]  I have seen when I'm in a deer blind and
[41:21.140 --> 41:26.180]  fawns baby deer that are almost grown up almost leaving their mother
[41:26.180 --> 41:30.020]  run out but she smells something she comes out gets in front of them tries to
[41:30.020 --> 41:34.500]  push them back in they don't listen you know what she does I've seen both
[41:34.500 --> 41:38.500]  she reaches over and bites them on the back they kick and get angry but then
[41:38.500 --> 41:44.180]  run off in the woods or shield I've seen them turn around and kick them
[41:44.180 --> 41:48.020]  look I smell a predator you're about to get killed oh but see
[41:48.020 --> 41:52.660]  the liberals would say walk right on out there
[41:52.660 --> 41:57.860]  now I'm not planning to shoot that little deer
[41:57.860 --> 42:01.540]  the point is is I'm waiting for the big buck to come out
[42:01.540 --> 42:08.180]  but she smells the smell of the creature that she knows kills deer and so she's
[42:08.180 --> 42:12.900]  going to do whatever she can when when the fawn was little she'd
[42:12.900 --> 42:15.860]  tell it lay down while I go out here and eat
[42:15.860 --> 42:20.100]  I'll come back and give you some milk and the little fawns their little spots
[42:20.100 --> 42:23.380]  lay down but they start getting bigger and it's almost
[42:23.380 --> 42:26.980]  time for them to be on their own but still it hadn't learned the lessons
[42:26.980 --> 42:33.140]  she's taught them so she bites them now does CPS need to land in helicopters
[42:33.140 --> 42:40.660]  and fire curary knockout darts into the the the doe the female deer
[42:40.660 --> 42:47.460]  and take those little those little fawn to a safe secure location
[42:48.180 --> 42:53.540]  why don't we send CPS to the Arctic where where where seals
[42:53.540 --> 43:00.580]  I've seen I've seen this everywhere in the animal kingdom
[43:00.580 --> 43:04.500]  this is what goes on it's always the same the parent who
[43:04.500 --> 43:08.180]  created the creature has an instinct to want to protect them
[43:08.180 --> 43:14.580]  that gives them sustenance tries to nudge them the first time
[43:14.580 --> 43:18.340]  then bark at them the next time and next time okay
[43:18.340 --> 43:21.460]  you are about to get killed I'm going to have to apply
[43:21.460 --> 43:27.380]  some pain now because you aren't listening to me
[43:27.380 --> 43:31.700]  so you let children run wild and then they go out into the world and are
[43:31.700 --> 43:35.300]  absolute animals and they end up in the penitentiary locked up in a little cell
[43:35.300 --> 43:38.420]  what's the greater abuse
[43:39.540 --> 43:43.620]  it's not abuse the system doesn't want you to be a parent
[43:43.620 --> 43:47.700]  and now the state of texas passed a law
[43:48.660 --> 43:52.740]  these legislators are so stupid they a lot of them aren't even evil they're
[43:52.740 --> 43:57.940]  dumb because it's it's common law and penal code
[43:57.940 --> 44:01.700]  for hundreds of years in this country
[44:01.700 --> 44:05.860]  that when someone turns their child over to the school
[44:05.860 --> 44:11.460]  they are now the guardian I know I'm belaboring this it's been a
[44:11.460 --> 44:14.820]  lot of time but it's a big issue
[44:16.340 --> 44:20.340]  and so the state tries to pass a law
[44:20.340 --> 44:25.060]  saying that schools can spank children because it's out of control
[44:25.060 --> 44:28.740]  and because parents are saying I can't spank so why are you
[44:28.740 --> 44:32.420]  you can spank you idiots
[44:32.900 --> 44:37.300]  so they pass a law saying now the parents have to give the approval
[44:37.300 --> 44:42.180]  the parents give the approval when you put them in that school
[44:42.180 --> 44:46.180]  if you don't like what's going on in the school you shouldn't put them there
[44:46.180 --> 44:50.100]  do you understand that's common law when you turn custody
[44:50.100 --> 44:53.620]  of a minor who does not have the rights of an adult
[44:53.620 --> 44:57.220]  and is not a sovereign that's why they don't get as big a prison sentences
[44:57.220 --> 45:01.300]  because the the courts and common sense and common law says
[45:01.300 --> 45:06.100]  they don't know any better who is libel
[45:06.100 --> 45:11.700]  they're guardian whether it's a police officer or a school
[45:11.700 --> 45:17.700]  teacher or the parent and you are the final guardian of
[45:17.700 --> 45:23.460]  your children you are the executor you are the trust holder
[45:23.460 --> 45:27.700]  and so they told you don't tell your kids what to do let them be themselves
[45:27.700 --> 45:31.540]  dr spock and all that stuff best-selling author sold more than the bible for 10
[45:31.540 --> 45:34.740]  years back in the 60s they said let your
[45:34.740 --> 45:37.940]  children be themselves oh really who who are you
[45:37.940 --> 45:41.460]  you are the instincts and culture of survival passed on
[45:41.460 --> 45:44.900]  for tens of thousands of years by your ancestors
[45:44.900 --> 45:49.700]  and everything they pass down to you and they're saying don't pass anything on
[45:49.700 --> 45:53.940]  let the television pass it on let the school pass it on
[45:53.940 --> 45:58.340]  let the system pass it on don't tell your children what to think or what to do
[45:58.340 --> 46:02.260]  or any lessons you've learned let them be themselves turn them loose
[46:02.260 --> 46:06.180]  don't discipline them treat them like they're an adult
[46:06.180 --> 46:11.060]  let children sue their parents and that's so the state and the social
[46:11.060 --> 46:15.540]  engineers can come in and take control of your children
[46:15.540 --> 46:20.820]  it's that simple it's very elementary and some children don't need to be
[46:20.820 --> 46:25.940]  disciplined others do the point is now they think
[46:25.940 --> 46:29.860]  they passed a law letting schools spank children
[46:29.860 --> 46:35.620]  and instead it just restricted common law just like they were saying we're
[46:35.620 --> 46:38.180]  going to pass a law that tsa can't grab your genitals
[46:38.180 --> 46:42.420]  it's already on the books that's why a cop can't do it without a warrant
[46:42.420 --> 46:45.620]  that's why an FBI agent can't do it it's why they never have done it
[46:45.620 --> 46:48.980]  they just set up a new body tell them they can do it
[46:48.980 --> 46:55.300]  get you in a herded group psychology system like an airport and more more
[46:55.300 --> 46:59.300]  more that's a social engineering laboratory and the system admits it so
[46:59.300 --> 47:02.420]  the state then finally takes our good bill saying we're going to enforce the
[47:02.420 --> 47:06.660]  law but it was never needed to begin with just enforce the law
[47:06.660 --> 47:10.340]  these lawmakers think that everything they need isn't already there
[47:10.340 --> 47:13.780]  so they always just pass something new and because they're not sophisticated
[47:13.780 --> 47:16.420]  rick perry comes in and has it changed to say
[47:16.420 --> 47:20.980]  okay all police now can stick their hands down your pants without a warrant
[47:20.980 --> 47:24.740]  and then we said we now have to remove support for this bill
[47:24.740 --> 47:29.620]  see it's all hoaxes and and and and and and and and and and bait and switches
[47:29.620 --> 47:34.820]  and shell games and scams now it gets worse
[47:34.820 --> 47:38.420]  in thousands of school districts last time i checked it was the majority
[47:38.420 --> 47:41.540]  and there's 20 something thousand school districts plus in the country but in
[47:41.540 --> 47:47.140]  in a large portion of them first it's no dodgeball
[47:47.140 --> 47:51.860]  then it's no tag then it's no wrestling then at many schools you can pull this
[47:51.860 --> 47:57.300]  up schools ban jogging at recess schools ban
[47:57.300 --> 48:01.540]  shaking hands at recess and now the teachers aren't allowed to touch them or
[48:01.540 --> 48:05.060]  talk to them oh billy just shook hands with
[48:05.060 --> 48:09.300]  with bobby i'm going to call the police and the cop shows up and writes you a
[48:09.300 --> 48:11.700]  ticket
[48:13.380 --> 48:19.380]  so they're taking all authority away from the people and the common
[48:19.380 --> 48:21.860]  law then the teachers and now a new phenomenon
[48:21.860 --> 48:25.380]  they're going to begin taking this is the un model the authority away from the
[48:25.380 --> 48:28.180]  police and transferring it only to special
[48:28.180 --> 48:33.060]  paramilitary units which are federally controlled
[48:33.060 --> 48:36.500]  oh yes this is next it's what they're attempting
[48:36.500 --> 48:41.060]  and so the cops can't do anything either under their common law citizens
[48:41.060 --> 48:43.860]  arrest citizens power of self-defense and a
[48:43.860 --> 48:47.860]  stop crime that's what police operate under we just
[48:47.860 --> 48:52.420]  create cities incorporate them and then and then vote in higher
[48:52.420 --> 48:56.580]  representatives to handle it for us because we're busy
[48:56.580 --> 48:59.860]  but pretty soon they try to become the boss so there that's how they're taking
[48:59.860 --> 49:03.620]  the power from the states the counties everybody that's how this
[49:03.620 --> 49:07.380]  this movement of power towards a centralized system and take the big
[49:07.380 --> 49:11.940]  psychiatric boards all coming out and saying we're against any form of
[49:11.940 --> 49:14.420]  discipline any form of corporal punishment even
[49:14.420 --> 49:18.180]  now they're saying take kids of you yell at them well well notice they're the
[49:18.180 --> 49:20.580]  groups that want to get your kid once they're out of control and put them on
[49:20.580 --> 49:25.380]  mind-altering drugs riddling prozac things that cause all sorts of
[49:25.380 --> 49:28.500]  health problems and the heart attacks i mean the
[49:28.500 --> 49:36.660]  suicides it's a cult of power and control taking over and remember
[49:36.660 --> 49:40.980]  they're taking children every day because the somebody saw him being spanked in
[49:40.980 --> 49:43.460]  their backyard you know billy hits jenny
[49:43.460 --> 49:46.820]  bloodies or nose dad goes that's it junior you little
[49:46.820 --> 49:53.780]  oh uh uh cps is a common and they take you into a fake court where it's just a
[49:53.780 --> 49:57.700]  judge not a jury you don't know it goes back to a eugenics court that used to
[49:57.700 --> 50:02.260]  sterilize people that hitler got his model from
[50:02.260 --> 50:05.940]  and they take your child away into the system where they're five times more
[50:05.940 --> 50:10.580]  likely to be abused at any other place how are they arresting people for
[50:10.580 --> 50:14.580]  filming police in public a big court just struck it down again today cops are
[50:14.580 --> 50:17.300]  going to stop arresting you for that they've been told go ahead and do it
[50:17.300 --> 50:21.300]  we're just going to do it we don't care
[50:21.300 --> 50:24.660]  how do they take children when you don't inoculate them happens all the time
[50:24.660 --> 50:28.580]  because they get ignorant parents that get in there scared of the judge and go
[50:28.580 --> 50:32.020]  i thought i didn't have to the judge goes i'm taking them forever unless you
[50:32.020 --> 50:35.780]  sign this order admitting that you've been derelict
[50:35.780 --> 50:38.900]  and then they let you have your kids for about a week or maybe a month and then
[50:38.900 --> 50:44.820]  claim you violated that agreement they get you to contract out your rights
[50:44.820 --> 50:48.900]  should they've got all this figured out it's all fraud it's all bamboozling
[50:48.900 --> 50:53.700]  so i hear these adults calling into the radio saying how's the government spanking
[50:53.700 --> 50:58.180]  but parents can't parents you don't know your rights you
[50:58.180 --> 51:02.260]  don't know the law you need to learn it or pet if you drive for a living
[51:02.260 --> 51:05.860]  you don't get paid to stop or wait in line
[51:05.860 --> 51:10.180]  keep your wheels moving with pre-pass bypass way stations
[51:10.180 --> 51:14.260]  fly by port of entry facilities stay moving at highway speed
[51:14.260 --> 51:20.260]  while the guy without pre-pass waits in line

[52:14.020 --> 52:18.260]  is leading the fight against the technocrats but we can't do that
[52:18.260 --> 52:22.980]  without your help by getting the films bumper stickers and t-shirts and info
[52:22.980 --> 52:26.340]  wars.com you will wake up people in your area
[52:26.340 --> 52:30.820]  and support our operation as we move to the next level
[52:30.820 --> 52:34.340]  we need your help to spread the word like never before
[52:34.340 --> 52:38.580]  they wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces
[52:38.580 --> 52:43.380]  of freedom and darkness you are the response to the globalist
[52:43.380 --> 52:48.100]  technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[52:48.100 --> 52:51.780]  and ultimate extermination the war is here
[52:51.780 --> 52:58.260]  it's an info war the spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of
[52:58.260 --> 53:02.420]  1984 attention gardeners this is an urgent gcn
[53:02.420 --> 53:05.940]  self-reliance update gcn has just discovered a new bioactive
[53:05.940 --> 53:09.460]  superfood for garden plants flowers and herbs it's called proto grow and it's
[53:09.460 --> 53:12.660]  so effective at producing rapid plant growth that it seems to almost force
[53:12.660 --> 53:15.460]  plants to grow like crazy under practically any soil in
[53:15.460 --> 53:18.580]  like conditions now here's the best part for our listeners who garden for
[53:18.580 --> 53:21.060]  self-reliance proto grows unique blend of sea
[53:21.060 --> 53:25.140]  nutrients maximizes mineral uptake and dramatically increases bloom set creating
[53:25.140 --> 53:28.420]  maximum plant growth in minimum time proto grow works by providing
[53:28.420 --> 53:31.540]  geometric keys which have the capacity to actually unlock the genetic code for
[53:31.540 --> 53:34.740]  nutritional uptake in plants proto grows full spectrum plant fertility
[53:34.740 --> 53:37.540]  means fruits and vegetables with extraordinary taste and up to 10 times
[53:37.540 --> 53:40.820]  the nutritional value and if you want to double or triple the potency of herbs
[53:40.820 --> 53:44.260]  or wheatgrass you can if you want to grow nutritionalized superfoods with
[53:44.260 --> 53:47.220]  non-hybrids it's now easy gcn listeners who want to grow
[53:47.220 --> 53:50.980]  dirt cheap superfood should visit the proto grow website at growlikecrazy.com
[53:50.980 --> 54:11.300]  that's www.growlikecrazy.com or call 877-327-0365 that's 877-327-0365
[54:21.700 --> 54:37.380]  okay we are back live and i have just digressed off into the issue of corporal punishment
[54:38.660 --> 54:45.460]  but this is an issue that i don't know anybody else is discussing and that's the fact that
[54:45.460 --> 54:53.300]  that the globalist system is for the hoax by the hoax of the hoax it's all about fraud
[54:54.020 --> 54:58.740]  just like they created 100 years ago now these fake family courts that are outside
[54:58.740 --> 55:04.900]  the constitution bill of rights they created the world trade organization in 1995 that
[55:04.900 --> 55:11.540]  our congress decided authority over to they created the un in 1945 46 officially
[55:11.540 --> 55:17.780]  now it orders obama to launch a war he does congress says hey you're not supposed to do
[55:17.780 --> 55:24.260]  that he says i'll do whatever i want it's it's about power grabs and then it's a hoax
[55:25.060 --> 55:30.020]  that they have the right or the authority to do this it's like rick perry uh four years ago said
[55:30.020 --> 55:36.100]  it's the law all girls in texas will take this shot 12 and under i am the governor it is the law
[55:36.100 --> 55:42.100]  law and women lined up everywhere paid almost $500 for the three shots and said the governor says
[55:42.100 --> 55:48.260]  it's the law unlike i had the state attorney on i don't know four years ago it was all over the
[55:48.260 --> 55:56.100]  national news um you probably remember it and it showed in maryland in baltimore the school
[55:56.100 --> 56:03.140]  in quote 2000 parents and students lined up with police dogs barking riot police and it was judge
[56:03.140 --> 56:10.900]  orders parents to inoculate children and i got the state attorney on and i said sir uh you know
[56:10.900 --> 56:16.900]  here's your code there's no law to take these shots i said so you know this was basically all just
[56:16.900 --> 56:23.940]  a hoax and he laughed and said yeah you're right and he said i don't vaccinate my kids but he was
[56:23.940 --> 56:29.300]  there overseeing and he started laughing like like it's funny or something i've seen the police on
[56:29.300 --> 56:34.260]  the news all over the country where they arrest people for filming them in public and then when
[56:34.260 --> 56:38.820]  it gets struck down in court later or the person even goes to jail people say but this isn't against
[56:38.820 --> 56:42.580]  the law and they just laugh about it it's like hey we just sent some innocent people to jail
[56:42.580 --> 56:47.460]  hey we just got up here and lied to people and said and seeing him was up there saying it's the
[56:47.460 --> 56:55.140]  law judge orders shots in maryland starting in baltimore 1500 students and their parents over
[56:55.140 --> 57:00.900]  2000 people and it was crying parents i don't like the shots i think they make my kids say but i gotta
[57:00.900 --> 57:07.220]  be here was mainly inner city people through the system praise on and i'd play the clips and i had
[57:07.220 --> 57:10.980]  guessed on and i was on air and i'd try to i got some of the parents on i'd say you don't have to
[57:10.980 --> 57:17.700]  take it i know mr jones but they say they're coming to arrest me and i said no the school is
[57:17.700 --> 57:21.140]  going to kick your child out for truancy they're like yes that's what they say then they're going
[57:21.140 --> 57:26.100]  to trigger a law for that but they can't order you out of school for not taking a shot when it's
[57:26.100 --> 57:34.260]  not the law it's only their policy and then they go so they're lying yes there's a waiver in their
[57:34.260 --> 57:40.980]  desk at the nurse's office you've got to demand it but it's not a law i know you don't have to do
[57:40.980 --> 57:45.540]  that but if you want to just prove to yourself and somebody would call back and say they gave me
[57:45.540 --> 57:52.420]  the waiver they got mad but they first they lied yes they lie they lie they lie they take babies
[57:52.420 --> 57:59.860]  blood at birth for almost 40 years worldwide except a few countries that globalists don't control
[57:59.860 --> 58:03.940]  and tell you it's for a blood test when it's not it goes into dna database that's now admitted
[58:05.620 --> 58:09.620]  you know i said i'd make this announcement about prison planet dot tv but i'll just do it later
[58:09.620 --> 58:16.820]  uh in the next hour uh we will be live tonight at prisonplanet.tv seven o'clock and live tomorrow
[58:16.820 --> 58:24.020]  night we're off monday uh but uh every weeknight seven o'clock most nights it'll be 30 minutes

[59:44.900 --> 59:57.860]  dot com that's rising prices empty shelves dot com waging war on corruption alex jones on the gcm
[59:57.860 --> 01:00:12.580]  radio network big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:21.540]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:31.220]  all right we've got three guests in this hour so we'll have open phones take a lot of your
[01:00:31.220 --> 01:00:35.540]  calls in the third hour today and i guess get into the news i haven't covered yet
[01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:43.540]  here's just some of the news out of alga zero this is actually 50 year old technology
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:49.380]  they discovered in the 20s and 30s that most cancers viral the rockefeller foundations were
[01:00:49.380 --> 01:00:54.100]  the first and bought up many of the hospitals that you think are charity hospitals that they run
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:59.700]  through fronts when their allied groups have been caught adding to cancer viruses to vaccines one
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:05.700]  of the big reasons you've seen a huge increase in cancer but here it is virus therapy sparks hope
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:10.740]  for cancer patients and you always hear about these new advancements but then they never get
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:15.780]  deployed to the public scientists say they have found a genetically engineered virus that can kill
[01:01:15.780 --> 01:01:22.740]  tumor cells without harming the patient and they've got new vaccines they want to get approved that
[01:01:22.740 --> 01:01:30.100]  cure you of drug use narcotics nicotine alcohol because it goes in reprograms and attacks and
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:34.260]  kills neurons in the brain so then you can't absorb natural endorphins don't worry they
[01:01:34.260 --> 01:01:39.380]  got a drug though it'll treat you after the virus has gone in and changed your brain and they call
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:48.980]  it a vaccine this isn't even an immunity these are nanotech and genetically engineered bots
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:55.860]  that they call viruses it's what they've done that go in and change you that's why the globalists
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:02:00.500]  are so arrogant and they're they're discussing just ending free will and just releasing all
[01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:05.060]  sorts of stuff where you get a fever you wake up you're a different person they said they've got
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:10.740]  vaccines it's in my report brain eating vaccines just type alex jones brain eating vaccines and
[01:02:10.740 --> 01:02:16.100]  about how you'll never be nervous or upset anymore that's right it'll go in and change your brain
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:21.700]  forever researchers have shown for the first time that a single intravenous infusion of a
[01:02:21.700 --> 01:02:28.260]  genetically engineered virus you think what we've got to worry about is uh is airborne Ebola and
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:36.820]  stuff folks that's so 1950s they've got stuff that they've got mouse pox stuff that's decades
[01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:40.900]  all it'll kill 99% of those that come in contact with it and that isn't even the genetically
[01:02:40.900 --> 01:02:48.260]  engineered super viruses it will home hone in on cancer killing tumor cells and patients
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:53.940]  without harming healthy tissue yeah scientists have been intrigued for decades with the idea of
[01:02:53.940 --> 01:03:01.220]  using viruses to alert the immune system to seek and destroy cancerous cells that interest has taken
[01:03:01.220 --> 01:03:06.500]  off in recent years as advances in genetic engineering allow them to customize viruses
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:11.460]  that target tumors and then of course those viruses will mutate and start targeting other
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:18.100]  tissues just like antibiotics overused has caused all the resistance and the flesh eating bacteria
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:23.940]  and that's if they just have a mistake with all these thousands of companies rolling the stuff out
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:30.740]  the field received a boost in january when biotech agent amgen
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:39.940]  amgen when biotech giant amgen ain't agreed to pay up to 1 billion to biovax the developer of the
[01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:51.700]  experimental cancer fighting virus on covex but the only on a colitic virus so far approved by
[01:03:51.700 --> 01:03:57.300]  regulatory agency is for the treatment of head and neck cancer in china oh yeah the chinese are
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:04:03.140]  approving everything cows that produce human milk heart human and their udders it's just on and on
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:10.420]  and on you name it they're doing it and there's thousands of companies doing this stuff and when
[01:04:10.420 --> 01:04:15.940]  you splice animals with together now it allows diseases that affect humans to affect cows diseases
[01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:21.700]  that affect cows to affect humans never before all these zoological bridges being made
[01:04:21.700 --> 01:04:31.860]  made and the system releases cancer viruses cancer becomes epidemic then they've got vaccines you
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:38.580]  take oh but then there'll be side effects things they didn't know it was going to reduce fertility
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:46.500]  changing brain chemistry so they artificially wreck our ecosystem then they come in with the
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:54.340]  solution you need we're not in kansas anymore it's buck rogers 2011
[01:05:01.860 --> 01:05:07.940]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:13.140]  relive history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the
[01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:19.620]  americans at home turning members influence on our president in congress and they really are calling
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:26.020]  the shots i think it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention for the
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:32.340]  republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying

[01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:42.420]  they're asking for more matches and the congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today
[01:05:42.420 --> 01:05:49.220]  seems like nobody does care and right now in washington dc we have seen a fall of the republic

[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:36.820]  the cia coup that is all up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com right now uh now
[01:09:37.860 --> 01:09:44.180]  starting tonight seven o'clock every week night except on holidays and on holidays we'll have
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:51.380]  um rebroadcast we're going to have at least a 30 minute focused power packed news transmission

[01:13:56.500 --> 01:14:01.140]  man that's the one that uh i mean i've done a couple of a couple other ones before that one
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:08.980]  but that was the one that got uh la pd got the authorities to uh to uh pay me a couple of visits
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:16.660]  right there so and for those that are listening on the radio it's an image of a chase branch bank
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:22.660]  a one-story building uh on fire uh with fire and smoke pouring out of the roof that's nice fire
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:28.180]  it looks real you're you're a good artist uh so so tell us tell us about yourself type of art you're
[01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:35.620]  into and then what happened uh well my name is alex schaefer and um i uh i i graduate art school in
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:41.780]  92 i worked as a video game computer graphic artist for about 10 years and uh and then i've
[01:14:41.780 --> 01:14:47.940]  been teaching and painting uh for the past 10 years and uh you know one of the things i love
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:55.220]  to do is uh i guess you'd call it impressionist plain air painting where you set up on location
[01:14:55.220 --> 01:15:01.860]  with your easel and you're you're painting in public and uh um you know for years i've been
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:09.540]  i've been painting those and selling them and uh but slowly i've been uh studying the uh the world
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:16.100]  of the economy and wall street and things like that and uh and being in touch with you know real
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:22.820]  news like we like we like we're getting on uh on the alex jones show and so i started to kind of
[01:15:22.820 --> 01:15:30.340]  combine the two my sort of political uh feelings about what's really going on with uh you know
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:37.300]  what i love to do which is uh plain air painting and uh to be perfectly honest i mean i can't tell
[01:15:37.300 --> 01:15:45.220]  you what was the moment that possessed me to do that uh but i'm just blown away by the uh by the
[01:15:45.220 --> 01:15:51.060]  response it's it's been incredible so you did a spontaneous painting and and i've painted my shelf
[01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:55.380]  buildings before and then said you know i'm gonna change this to a nuked city my parents have that
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:16:00.260]  painting i've done hundreds of paintings but two or three of them are of either bombed out cities
[01:16:00.260 --> 01:16:07.300]  uh or uh burning cities one of them's of a world war two photo i saw a burlin on fire somewhere
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:13.140]  around here and uh i mean if somebody saw that at my parents house hanging would they call the police
[01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:20.100]  and and what was the spontaneous idea i mean i mean was it that uh i mean i know if i painted
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:26.980]  that that chases burning down our economy or or what was the mental image that made you do that uh i
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:34.180]  think uh i i took a trip to new york and a couple of kind of months prior uh i'd been doing some
[01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:40.420]  kind of a small series of just fantasy riot scenes that were just kind of from my imagination
[01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:46.740]  and uh and then i when i went to new york i went to wall street and i i did a little sketching
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:53.300]  there of wall street and then i turned wall street into kind of a fantasy flaming riot scene
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:17:00.100]  and uh so i think that that was kind of the beginning of where i was going with this well
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:05.460]  there's a lot of talk about apocalyptic collapse and things there's all these movies tv shows
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:09.780]  uh countless films being made with zombies running around killing everybody
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:14.980]  why do you think they singled you out tell us about the the thought police officer that first
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:22.900]  noticed this and and called uh called the ministry of love right uh well here's the here's the irony
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:29.140]  okay when i'm painting i'm it's street art i'm on the street there's i was at a bus stop uh on van
[01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:35.140]  eyes right across from this branch there's tons of people walking by uh i was right in front of a
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:40.580]  lawyer's office and he was you know giving me glasses of water and everybody the whole public
[01:17:40.580 --> 01:17:45.780]  got off the bus and they got it you know they thought oh that's great oh you know the chase is
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:51.940]  screwing up my mortgage blah blah blah and uh but so i mean i really didn't think anything oh i
[01:17:51.940 --> 01:17:57.700]  thought oh this is fantastic and then i saw the uh the police come up van eyes and and flip a u
[01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:04.820]  turn and pull over and approach me and uh the specific uh thing that the officer said was
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:11.300]  it somebody called the police and said that they felt threatened uh by my painting threatened that
[01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:18.500]  was the word well now in the uh fascistic politically correct system uh they are scared
[01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:22.740]  of images they are scared of ideas if you were painting regular houses burning they wouldn't
[01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:30.500]  be too upset but you are uh showing the man on fire and and showing through peaceful art uh
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:36.100]  your concern and you said people were resonating with you and uh but but this is certainly back
[01:18:36.100 --> 01:18:42.420]  fired on them uh now your image is uh in hundreds of publications and becoming quite iconic and i
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:47.300]  would imagine you could probably get fifty thousand dollars at auction uh for that painting in fact a
[01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:51.780]  capitalist in me you want to do some deal or we auction it off here on the air next week or something
[01:18:51.780 --> 01:18:58.340]  i'm ready to do it it's on ebay right now my friend oh okay too late how much is it going for uh if
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:04.500]  you go to ebay uh and you search chase burning then you can find the uh you can find the auction
[01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:10.820]  and i started it off at nine hundred and twenty dollars which i said was uh basically half an
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:17.220]  ounce of gold and and then i compared that to vincent van Gogh's one art sale of four hundred
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:24.420]  francs which at that time translated to four ounces of gold so that means van Gogh's first sale was
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:30.500]  for about seven thousand three hundred dollars so i don't think i'm any kind of a van Gogh and i aimed
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:37.140]  way lower but uh so far it's been uh almost bid up to the to the value of of an ounce of gold
[01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:42.660]  it's at seventeen seventy five there's been eleven bids and thirty five watchers or something like
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:47.780]  that it's uh pretty awesome well it's about to go up to fifty thousand right now stay there
[01:19:49.140 --> 01:19:54.020]  stay there we'll be right back i know you look a little van going in stay with us ladies and

[01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:17.380]  alex schaefer is our guest la artist faces police questioning or painting banks in flames
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:23.300]  death and taxes reported on that and had a photo of another bank in flames so he's done uh
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:29.060]  uh i guess more than one of these or i guess since it got the attention he's out doing
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:34.980]  more of it so alex tell us about the visits uh you got from the police fbi and others
[01:24:35.860 --> 01:24:41.860]  okay well the first one was two officers uh approached me on the street uh they pulled
[01:24:41.860 --> 01:24:51.380]  up in the cruiser um and they said what are you doing and i said i'm painting and uh they said well
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:58.260]  someone said they felt threatened by your painting uh can we see your id um now the great thing was
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:04.180]  that this lawyer that i was painting in front of he was just like an instant street advocate and uh
[01:25:04.180 --> 01:25:09.860]  but i did present them with my identification i didn't have a problem with that and uh you know
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:15.620]  one of the officers that was there uh what just kind of stood next to me and was talking to me
[01:25:15.620 --> 01:25:21.700]  and i was talking to him and and he said well you know you could be a terrorist and and uh and i said
[01:25:22.580 --> 01:25:29.140]  but do you really think like this is how a terrorist is going to case out fire bombing a bank
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:34.340]  no you're you're using art to prevent to purvey a powerful message yeah and and that's what they're
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:38.900]  saying i've got government training manuals where they say american flags get us out of the un stickers
[01:25:38.900 --> 01:25:45.380]  uh ron paul stickers that can mean terror so they're telling us that free speech is basically terrorism
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:52.740]  yeah i mean i think that uh i think that the officers i think they thought it was ridiculous
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:59.300]  a little bit themselves um but they filled out an incident report you know they got my
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:05.060]  address and uh i thought it was funny that they wrote down in the personal oddities line
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:11.060]  that uh i had glasses and a blonde beard well that's evil you may be with alcada but but
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:16.420]  we actually have the training videos you now are been put in a homeland security database i can
[01:26:16.980 --> 01:26:20.820]  send you that article on that well we got it a few years ago when they come up they say if you
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:26.180]  have a cell phone or binoculars or wearing blue jeans i'm not kidding go ahead and put people
[01:26:26.180 --> 01:26:32.900]  in the terror database i well i was just covered head to toe with dirty paint clothes i thought
[01:26:32.900 --> 01:26:40.260]  that was more of a personal oddity uh but um but i think the thing that was really weird to me was
[01:26:40.260 --> 01:26:48.580]  when they when the two officers came to my house three weeks later i really thought okay whatever
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:52.660]  so this is just now getting attention so they put you in a database and now they
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:56.660]  now the intimidation isn't enough that you've been put in big brother's database they show up
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:04.820]  yeah yeah they showed up and i mean i you know it's intimidating i i i don't hate the police or
[01:27:04.820 --> 01:27:12.900]  you know harbour any animosity towards uh towards the authorities but um what are they saying to you
[01:27:12.900 --> 01:27:17.860]  it's it well it's intimidating to talk to officers yeah they wouldn't like to go into their house so
[01:27:17.860 --> 01:27:25.940]  so what did they say to you well again they knocked on the door they said la pd and i was like oh boy
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:31.620]  and they said do you know why we're here and i said is it because of that painting i did
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:40.980]  and they said yes and uh they you know again asked me are the is this your intention do you
[01:27:40.980 --> 01:27:48.980]  intend to do this and you know i just said no you know this is just a political statement that i'm
[01:27:48.980 --> 01:27:55.540]  making and uh you know like like they they they specifically asked me do you hate the banks they
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:28:00.500]  twice they use the word you hate the banks and i you know i would throw it back to them by saying
[01:28:00.500 --> 01:28:08.260]  well you're a police officer do you hate criminals you know you wish the criminals did not engage
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:14.500]  in criminal activity you don't spend your life hating them and that's how i feel about most of
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:22.500]  the big banks uh but basically right now all the big banks they are engaging in criminal activity
[01:28:23.220 --> 01:28:28.980]  fraud larceny you know you're not supposed to to get to even talk about that and so what happened
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:37.140]  next uh well then they said well can we see the painting and i sweat and i'd actually left it at
[01:28:37.140 --> 01:28:45.060]  the hive gallery where i'm at right now and uh but i showed them just another banal uh street scene
[01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:49.380]  painting that i'm done just just just to show them an example of my work and i'm holding it up and i
[01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:54.740]  said look it's like this but if i just started painting a bunch of orange and red right here
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:29:00.260]  you know um so you have the art police show up yes yes the art police now now
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:05.780]  how did it end because i'm gonna have you back up after the auction or in the near future because
[01:29:05.780 --> 01:29:09.620]  you're an intriguing individual but how did it end were there more visits what else happened
[01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:15.540]  uh i haven't had any more visits with with the officers and uh but you know it's funny i have

[01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:48.260]  coming up in fact i can't even do justice for the fact that ron paul's come out and talked about
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:54.900]  basically a cia coup in america uh fema wanting emergencies and disasters to take control when
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:34:00.820]  it went asked about fema camps uh going after rick perry when asked about how he was hillary's
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:06.820]  big uh buddy and supported hillary care and worked for al gore i mean it's all coming out
[01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:15.300]  and that the that stuff is cyanide politically to rick perry hope the thought police will come
[01:34:15.300 --> 01:34:22.500]  they'll say i'm saying you cyanide no i said political cyanide on his campaign okay or it'd
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:28.180]  be like kryptonite the superman but he's not superman is the point by the way this fellow who um
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:34.100]  was just on with us who painted chase on fire and the police keep coming you know visiting him
[01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:41.780]  and things alex schaefer you notice that uh now it's it's only empowering him and and
[01:34:41.780 --> 01:34:46.420]  he's probably gonna end up making him a famous uh artist that's how it happens he's a talented guy
[01:34:46.420 --> 01:34:51.860]  but he got his break and uh if i would have had time i would have asked him buddy you knew something
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:55.940]  like this was going to happen and you you pulled their strings good which is smart you got to
[01:34:55.940 --> 01:34:59.780]  manipulate the globalist you know they try to manipulate us but we just let them come right
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:04.420]  into our trap we don't use deception we just do our thing and know what they're going to do
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:08.900]  and know how to respond to it we're going to win when we have the initiative that's why they're so
[01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:14.420]  scared of that painting that image that idea because it brings together hatred of true tyranny
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:18.500]  not of the puppets you think they care of folks riot and burn down their own neighborhoods no
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:23.540]  they don't want people thinking about going after the real corrupt government of this country i don't
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:27.860]  want any violence against chase and all these other guys goldman sacks they're really the
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:33.380]  bad one i want to go after them through the law now we're going to our guests here in a moment
[01:35:33.380 --> 01:35:37.780]  but speaking of ron paul we've got two new t-shirts where you get the word out about ron paul 2012
[01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:42.980]  and support our info war it's a symbiotic relationship uh it's when fascism goes to sleep
[01:35:42.980 --> 01:35:48.980]  it looks under the bed for ron paul we had listeners request this t-shirt i'm not sure even sure who
[01:35:48.980 --> 01:35:54.020]  coined it um but i was in an email saying hey i want to make a t-shirt so here it is when fascism
[01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:59.140]  goes to sleep it looks under the bed for ron paul with the symbols of fascism and on the back it
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:04.340]  says ron paul 2012 and info wars dot com and we've got another one that says save the republic
[01:36:04.340 --> 01:36:11.220]  ron paul 2012 on the back legalized freedom so a black t-shirt and a white t-shirt both available
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:17.140]  at info wars dot com and the little bit of uh change we make helps find that this great
[01:36:17.140 --> 01:36:22.820]  organization that you've helped bill so that we can support ron paul the 911 first responders and
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:26.980]  so many other organizations and groups that we get on and promote here now
[01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:33.140]  now i saw this last week
[01:36:37.620 --> 01:36:43.380]  i saw this last week one of the producers brought it in and i double-taked and i had to go get online
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:49.460]  just to make sure that i was really reading i mean i thought it was one of these things where
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:55.620]  people make a fake site and then make it look like cnn or fox or associated press i've seen that before
[01:36:55.620 --> 01:37:00.020]  where people actually make a fake url and and but you can immediately read until it's fake and i read
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:09.220]  this and i thought this really reads like a cnn report but this can't be true so i searched it
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:20.660]  little did i know this news had been out for several weeks several weeks it first broke in
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:28.020]  early august bloomberg put his press release out and it was ap fox cnn and all reporting it like
[01:37:28.020 --> 01:37:34.420]  it's totally reasonable and see that's another story not just that they barred the first responders
[01:37:34.420 --> 01:37:37.300]  from the tenth anniversary but that it's not a bigger issue
[01:37:40.580 --> 01:37:45.780]  i mean look at this and it goes on to say that they are barred from it because mayor bloomberg
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:51.380]  and and also now we turned out the white house is behind this no god is to be mentioned 30 000 plus
[01:37:51.380 --> 01:37:57.220]  the people just in the area 100 000 around it no porta potties it's really bizarre they don't want
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:38:04.260]  people there they don't want the first responders there because look at these headlines congressional
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:09.220]  ordered screening of 9 11 responders turns up no terrorist that's right they are being screened as
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:14.900]  terrorists the first responders 911 responders to be warned they will be screened by fbi's terrorism
[01:38:14.900 --> 01:38:20.580]  watch list hovington post i mean i'm reading new york post hovington post here's uh another one here
[01:38:24.340 --> 01:38:29.620]  the health care act compensation won't cover 9 11 survivors with cancer they know there's thousands
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:37.380]  of surviving men and women firefighters police medics doctors national guard heroes when when
[01:38:37.380 --> 01:38:44.580]  everybody was running out the old cliche they ran in and for nine years they blocked coverage even though
[01:38:44.580 --> 01:38:49.780]  all the major universities out there did the scans of their lungs full of asbestos the deaths
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:55.300]  all the police dogs died in a couple years even people got their feet chopped off by falling debris
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:39:00.820]  you know in the uh a recovery effort and the demolition effort they wouldn't get treatment so
[01:39:00.820 --> 01:39:05.860]  we fought i went did food in new york mountain expense rented buildings they have 100 the first
[01:39:05.860 --> 01:39:10.500]  responders the groups that were pushing to get the compensation when they finally got the compensation
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:14.260]  they said you got to go through a terror database and now we're not going to cover most stuff
[01:39:14.260 --> 01:39:17.940]  so that's why they don't want them there they said they're going to have a fire chief police chief
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:24.500]  in the military just brass there they're not allowed in the pit they're not allowed in the main
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:32.180]  event and why is that well i know why but here to give us their view on it uh is uh joey garofalo
[01:39:32.180 --> 01:39:36.100]  new york city correctional officer and worked at ground zero in the first few weeks from 9 11
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:41.380]  he's the founder director of 911 wtc first responders foundation remember building seven
[01:39:41.380 --> 01:39:47.700]  dot org and ted walter started doing research uh for many years and have been involved ever since
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:52.660]  and he's the director of nyc can and remember building seven campaign they've run those ads
[01:39:52.660 --> 01:39:56.660]  that have gotten national attention and that our listeners have supported and i want to thank you
[01:39:56.660 --> 01:40:00.580]  the listeners for doing that before we get into this year's 10th anniversary and what's happening
[01:40:00.580 --> 01:40:05.940]  and now obama put out talking points saying use it to you know take liberties expand the war on
[01:40:05.940 --> 01:40:13.860]  terror but no responders uh what is your view and why do you think they're barring the first
[01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:24.580]  responders from the event uh joey ted whoever wants to go first hey yeah this is ted here uh joey
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:36.020]  you want to take that hey joey are you there joey garofalo i think we lost his phone line while
[01:40:36.020 --> 01:40:41.140]  we're getting joey back on the line uh uh ted uh you're a new yorker you've been you're covering
[01:40:41.140 --> 01:40:46.820]  this why do you think this happened well yeah the first responders bring a sad story to 9 11
[01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:51.460]  and the country you know the powers that be want to forget they want they want people to be happy
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:57.140]  they don't want people to look at the real effects of of 9 11 the fact that we're in two three
[01:40:57.140 --> 01:41:02.260]  you know uncountable numbers of wars the fact we've got thousands of first responders dying
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:06.580]  that's the story that first responders bring to 9 11 and that's why the powers that be don't want
[01:41:06.580 --> 01:41:12.420]  them there so and yeah the first responders are angry especially with the cancer issue joey has
[01:41:12.420 --> 01:41:18.260]  been an outspoken voice um against this and it's just it's just really unconscionable that cancer
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:23.940]  is not being covered by zedroga it's really unconscionable now joey now that you're there
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:29.300]  with us uh specifically expanding on that uh you're saying you concur with my analysis that
[01:41:29.300 --> 01:41:33.620]  they know that they were poisoned the epa was ordered to lie about the deadly dust they've
[01:41:33.620 --> 01:41:37.300]  been blocked health care and the government doesn't want them there because they're scared of them
[01:41:42.580 --> 01:41:47.060]  all right i think we're having some kind of uh technical difficulties or something
[01:41:47.060 --> 01:41:52.580]  with folks we'll just interview ted uh uh well ted can you give us your view on these folks
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:41:57.860]  yeah well i've spent a lot of time with them the last few years and and look uh it's not a happy
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:42:02.740]  bunch of people um they're suffering they're dying uh we thought last year was a little bit of a
[01:42:02.740 --> 01:42:08.180]  breakthrough there was gonna be some funding for them um but yeah as we found out because cancer
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:12.740]  is not being covered doesn't huge percentage of the first responders um and it's not only the
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:18.340]  only the first responders last year um a dear friend of nyc can uh jenette mckinley passed away
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:25.060]  she uh had a brain tumor and she was in she was right across the street from the world trade center
[01:42:25.060 --> 01:42:31.460]  when it collapsed and a huge mountain of dust flew broke through her windows she inhaled it
[01:42:31.460 --> 01:42:36.500]  and she's not with us anymore and so they know they know what they know what that dust uh did
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:40.580]  they know it's in that dust they know what that dust does to people and when you bring first
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:44.820]  responders into the story it just brings us closer to the truth about what happened on 9 11
[01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:52.180]  now uh ted while we're getting joey back on the line we had some issues with that line um
[01:42:53.540 --> 01:42:57.620]  he was up for a second it sounded like he was agreeing or or perhaps that was you
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:04.020]  but but when you talk to these first responders these these heroes uh why do they think they're
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:08.980]  barred from the ceremony and uh is it hurtful i know they're in the cnn articles and others
[01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:13.060]  saying they're outraged and they don't know why this is happening but how could mayor bloomberg
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:18.900]  just calmly say yeah you're not welcome again because they bring a story they bring a story of
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:25.140]  pain and and they're still angry you know uh the first uh the family members a lot of family
[01:43:25.140 --> 01:43:30.820]  members are very angry are still looking for the truth um but a lot of family members uh
[01:43:30.820 --> 01:43:37.380]  are are going to be at the ceremony and and unfortunately have um you know have have are
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:41.860]  willing to sort of support the official narrative that's been going on um because it's a really
[01:43:41.860 --> 01:43:47.140]  painful i mean unspeakably painful topic for them as well but the first responders are much
[01:43:47.140 --> 01:43:51.060]  are much less willing and they've got so much to be angry about because they're still not getting
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:56.580]  the support that they that they need 10 years later um and so yeah if they were there they would
[01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:00.180]  they would be they would be outspoken they wouldn't be contributing to the dynamic that
[01:44:00.180 --> 01:44:06.980]  that new york city mike bloomberg president etc are trying to create um they just don't fit into
[01:44:06.980 --> 01:44:11.460]  that narrative that we're supposed to be all swallowing on the 10th anniversary did you see
[01:44:11.460 --> 01:44:16.180]  two days ago when the white house talking points that were supposed to be secret went out to state
[01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:21.220]  government federal government and foreign governments about the narrative of al-qaeda is a threat we've
[01:44:21.220 --> 01:44:27.140]  got to have more wars got to take your rights we're going to keep you safe i mean they they want to
[01:44:27.140 --> 01:44:31.380]  use the heroes and the images of the people on the pile but they don't want people to see them in
[01:44:31.380 --> 01:44:37.780]  their wheelchairs and coughing up blood like i have exactly exactly it's a very sad story but you
[01:44:37.780 --> 01:44:42.740]  know who's telling the real story uh you look you look across the pond europe there there are a number
[01:44:42.740 --> 01:44:48.340]  of documentaries coming out this weekend one is coming out on m6 uh that's the basically the second
[01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:53.300]  biggest channel in france and it's telling the story of the first responders and their suffering
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:57.060]  and it's telling the story of the family members and their suffering as well and the fact that they
[01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:02.260]  haven't had a real investigation it's the murder of their loved ones and so like media and other
[01:45:02.260 --> 01:45:06.820]  parts of the world are are awake and they're waking up and they're telling the stories that that
[01:45:06.820 --> 01:45:11.940]  that need to be told the real stories and that's because people in europe are waking up this weekend
[01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:17.220]  we are going to have a breakthrough we have major documentaries in france germany and italy coming
[01:45:17.220 --> 01:45:21.940]  out about the remember building seven campaign they're going to be seen by at least 10 million
[01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:29.620]  european and europeans they're not they're not prone to deceiving themselves as quickly as
[01:45:29.620 --> 01:45:33.780]  much of the people in our country because they've been through a lot of stuff over the last 100
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:37.380]  years or so so when they see building seven collapse they're going to know that's a controlled
[01:45:37.380 --> 01:45:41.620]  demolition you don't have to you know talk to a scientist to figure that out and europeans are
[01:45:41.620 --> 01:45:49.780]  going to see it they're going to say what the hell now uh talking to the first responders i don't
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:54.980]  have been to many memorials and i remember six seven eight years ago out there with 911s and
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:59.780]  inside job shirts outside the memorial and some of the police some of the firemen cussing at us
[01:46:00.420 --> 01:46:06.340]  but the last few times i went i mean it was the commander saying appreciate you alex we're with
[01:46:06.340 --> 01:46:10.660]  you well hey you want to be on camera no but just know we're with you and firefighters everywhere
[01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:17.140]  i went buying me dinner and police shaking my hand so it seems to be a total flip and i've
[01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:22.260]  interviewed some of the heads of some of the biggest 911 victims groups and they've said this
[01:46:22.260 --> 01:46:27.300]  is four or five years ago uh if we've got one of the interviews in terror storm uh with the head
[01:46:27.300 --> 01:46:32.980]  of the biggest 911 group and he said the majority more than 50 of the families believe it's an inside
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:38.740]  job uh and and of course that was five years ago uh when you talk to the first responders i mean is
[01:46:38.740 --> 01:46:43.060]  it are they barred just because they're mad about the cancer and the dust and not being given health
[01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:48.420]  care or or is it also the fact that a lot of them know the truth a lot of them know the truth so
[01:46:48.420 --> 01:46:54.260]  many of them know the truth and they were all told very shortly after 911 not to speak about it or
[01:46:54.260 --> 01:47:00.260]  they lose their jobs and they lose their pensions i've spoken to probably about two dozen individual
[01:47:00.260 --> 01:47:05.220]  first responders myself who've all told me the same thing and um you know we we try to get them
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:10.580]  to come out we got guys that you know we're like two blocks away from the trade center um when it
[01:47:10.580 --> 01:47:16.100]  was you know basically in the process of collapsing they watched pieces of the building like shoot off
[01:47:16.100 --> 01:47:20.660]  like very very clear explosion they want to talk about it but they're scared because they're going
[01:47:20.660 --> 01:47:25.780]  to lose their pension you know well it's on tape the explosions before seven fell and you got cops
[01:47:25.780 --> 01:47:30.980]  saying get back they're bringing seven down that's on CNN and i've interviewed two of the police
[01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:34.260]  officers and then of course after they came on the air later they're like it's gotten too many
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:39.780]  threats i'm not coming back on but they've gone public um and and and luke of course knows them
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:42.820]  all but are not from memory i can't mention i don't remember their names but i've had a lot
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:48.580]  of them on and they're people that were there and heard the countdown uh four building seven
[01:47:49.460 --> 01:47:54.180]  and and and then the the debunker spin it and say you're saying the police and firemen were
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:59.300]  involved no they were there and were told by fema get back it's coming down that's on CNN
[01:47:59.300 --> 01:48:04.740]  then they were threatened don't tell anybody what you saw and now they're not allowed at the memorial
[01:48:04.740 --> 01:48:12.580]  service why do you think the system so but so bold uh this is why the system is so bold i mean
[01:48:12.580 --> 01:48:17.780]  it's just the media that we're up against is just it's a huge megaphone and we're fighting against it
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:24.820]  we have you know we've got so many people so much testimony um and yet you know it it's it's
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:29.140]  challenged to break through uh which is why what we're doing now with the remember building seven
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:33.620]  campaign and tent anniversary is we're getting the thousands tens of thousands of people that are
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:38.420]  out there that know the truth uh to come together on tent anniversary because you know what if we
[01:48:38.420 --> 01:48:42.740]  can raise a million dollars which is what we're trying to do uh you can be sure basically what
[01:48:42.740 --> 01:48:48.180]  a million dollars will allow us to do is show building seven to half of the people in new york
[01:48:48.180 --> 01:48:53.540]  metropolitan area that's about 10 million people who will see building seven collapse and when one
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:58.260]  in two people see building seven collapsed that will that will break through there will be serious
[01:48:58.260 --> 01:49:02.180]  discussion about building seven people don't have preconceived notions about building seven
[01:49:02.180 --> 01:49:05.300]  because they don't know about it when they see it on tv that they're going to wake up
[01:49:05.300 --> 01:49:10.580]  and the media won't be able to stop this this discussion from happening well for whatever
[01:49:10.580 --> 01:49:14.900]  reason we lost joey but we're definitely going to get him back up on another day and i want to
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:20.500]  get mr felon and a lot of other organizations uh again i i don't want to just glaze over this the
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:27.460]  magnitude the the the desperateness that it shows the system love to get the cops and their
[01:49:27.460 --> 01:49:32.900]  dress blues and the fire people and all the folks out there and point at them and use them
[01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:38.820]  but the fact is most of them have woken up and know the truth now so they're barred they're barred
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:43.220]  from an event i was reading numbers of 30 000 are going to be let in but none of the first
[01:49:43.220 --> 01:49:49.700]  responders and and bloomberg had a quote about they are not the focus but they they are the heroes
[01:49:49.700 --> 01:49:56.180]  of 9 11 i mean any way you look at it inside job or not these are the heroes and the government
[01:49:56.180 --> 01:50:02.740]  says they're barred i mean this is twilight zone yeah it is it is and you know what we're going to
[01:50:02.740 --> 01:50:07.780]  break through it on this anniversary um our numbers are just too much now across the world
[01:50:07.780 --> 01:50:14.100]  uh we we need what we're looking for at rememberbuilding7.org is for 20 000 people to come together
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:18.100]  give an average donation of just 50 dollars each for the anniversary and with that we're

[01:54:27.300 --> 01:54:32.740]  sorry we got our number scrambled but he is here and he was a new york city correctional officer
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:38.900]  who worked at ground zero in the first few weeks over 9-11 he is the founder and director of 9-1-1
[01:54:38.900 --> 01:54:47.060]  wtc first responders foundation uh joey uh i went through a chronicle earlier of mainstream news
[01:54:47.060 --> 01:54:54.260]  admitting that the first responders are barred from this year's event you're not invited uh and
[01:54:54.260 --> 01:54:58.820]  i know it's very hurtful to the true heroes at 9-11 why do you think they're doing this sir
[01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:07.140]  well alex um i'll tell you the truth at first i thought it was because of um
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:17.220]  um protection and um i wanted to really believe that knowing that um you know first responders
[01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:22.100]  were already hurt and injured and got forbid anything would happen they wanted to keep us
[01:55:22.100 --> 01:55:28.580]  away from it and i still believe that because that could be part of you know their reasoning
[01:55:28.580 --> 01:55:38.820]  but my real belief is it's political it's it's an obama campaign that uh our mayor had teamed up
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:44.580]  with because um you know he's he's been just you know one after the other you know starting with
[01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:52.500]  obama and going against first responders from day one indicative to um whatever you know plans he
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:56:00.100]  had put into effect um by protocol that he had to to take care of any you know first responders
[01:56:00.100 --> 01:56:07.780]  such as the medical monitoring program at mount sinai or um uh you know going to funerals i mean
[01:56:07.780 --> 01:56:15.140]  it's it's just it's just one mistake after the next and it's a disrespect a totally disrespect
[01:56:15.140 --> 01:56:22.100]  and it's a disrespect and an embarrassment to this country the spirit of america i mean this
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:29.700]  is not what our forefathers had planned for the future well if the survivors aren't there period
[01:56:29.700 --> 01:56:33.940]  and are barred and they're saying they'll have one little ceremony with a police chief or something
[01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:41.780]  this is outrageous this is asinine this is this is so absurdist it's it's it's like satire and when
[01:56:41.780 --> 01:56:47.380]  i first saw it and seeing in a week ago i didn't know it'd been out for weeks before that no one
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:52.420]  had even made an issue out of it and i didn't believe it when i first saw it and then went and
[01:56:52.420 --> 01:56:57.540]  found it uh from the firefighters and police i've talked to everyone i've seen on the ground
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:57:03.380]  most of them question obviously wtc seven the official story instead of flipping me off like
[01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:08.660]  they do eight years ago they come over and pat me on the back i mean the majority of them uh do you
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:12.340]  think that also they don't want people there they could do some embarrassing things could could say
[01:57:12.340 --> 01:57:17.140]  some embarrassing things we just had a controlled demolition in another city and a guy jumped upon
[01:57:17.140 --> 01:57:23.780]  stage on tv and said nine eleven's right in front of you uh look at the control demolition what's
[01:57:23.780 --> 01:57:30.820]  your view on that sir yeah no absolutely i mean i mean there are there are several reasons um here
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:37.380]  which which have a lot of probable cause for their reasoning and um by all means i mean hey
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:44.020]  you know people are going to show up and they're going to exercise their right um without a doubt
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:51.620]  and to tell you the truth i probably would have been one of them to you know to say something like
[01:57:51.620 --> 01:57:58.980]  the biggest thing is and why i joined the um remember building seven campaign uh is primarily
[01:57:58.980 --> 01:58:08.260]  because when that building went down and all my documents there was no mention of wtc seven
[01:58:08.260 --> 01:58:16.340]  and my settlement with the city any medical documents meanwhile it added an increased
[01:58:16.340 --> 01:58:21.700]  toxins into the air unnecessarily well joey do you think this is going to backfire though because
[01:58:21.700 --> 01:58:27.220]  i'm told a bunch of first responders are going to be outside the gates with the media pointing
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:35.140]  out that you're barred well yeah i mean there are cause cause being made um i i've been told

[02:00:05.540 --> 02:00:12.820]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:21.860]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:27.780 --> 02:00:33.940]  okay we are back live tons of news in your phone calls coming up in the next segment incredible
[02:00:33.940 --> 02:00:42.020]  developments from the ron paul camp we are joined by joey garofalo who is a new york city
[02:00:42.020 --> 02:00:46.500]  correctional officer and worked at ground zero in the first few weeks of nine eleven
[02:00:46.500 --> 02:00:54.500]  he is a founder and director of 911 wtc first responders foundation uh bottom line sir it's
[02:00:54.500 --> 02:01:00.580]  seeing in fox news are reporting that the first responders the heroes of survivors are barred
[02:01:01.860 --> 02:01:08.740]  from the tenth anniversary what is your view on that why do you think they're doing it and i've
[02:01:08.740 --> 02:01:13.060]  i've called for i know others are calling for if you heard anything about a demonstration
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:17.700]  by the heroes that they're barred while the political pimps sit there and try to push their
[02:01:17.700 --> 02:01:27.620]  agenda uh off of your fallen fallen comrades yeah well alex thanks for having me on first off um
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:36.820]  yeah it was very shocking um when i heard it myself and as far as my belief there could be several
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:43.700]  uh you know several of their reasons the one which is the least and you know protecting any
[02:01:43.700 --> 02:01:49.620]  first responder who's already sick from being out in you know back in in in manhattan with such a
[02:01:49.620 --> 02:01:54.900]  large crowd so we're going to put that on the bottom uh because any first responder who was not
[02:01:54.900 --> 02:02:02.900]  who was ill and not able to go would not go primarily because of that so i won't even believe
[02:02:02.900 --> 02:02:12.420]  that and the other reason who which i really believe is uh you you call it pimping um it's
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:19.460]  obama campaign it's it's it's the mayor uh you know campaigning for obama you're bringing in politicians
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:27.700]  that have no business being there okay why are they there now you know god bless the families
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:33.380]  okay of all the daily departed those are the true heroes okay and the innocent victims
[02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:40.500]  who stood and waited for you know uh the first responders or rescuers to come in those are the
[02:02:40.500 --> 02:02:48.100]  true heroes okay but this is our history and basically uh to tell you the truth they're talking
[02:02:48.100 --> 02:02:54.020]  about sending out you know squads the first responders and when i'm saying they uh the
[02:02:54.020 --> 02:02:59.140]  various different groups there's been talk i receive calls i receive emails shall we bring
[02:02:59.140 --> 02:03:04.500]  a group get as many people as you can let's come down let's do a human chain around the perimeter
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:09.940]  the police are not going to arrest us you know and i laughed at it first up number one i'm not
[02:03:09.940 --> 02:03:14.740]  going to believe that okay with this man and especially with the president in town come on
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:20.660]  or better off they don't care who you are they've already disrespected us in many ways okay with
[02:03:20.660 --> 02:03:26.900]  their political uh you know agenda it's the political bully that is controlling okay the
[02:03:26.900 --> 02:03:34.260]  disrespect and when i say political bully alex uh i gave it a definition of protocol and procedure
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:39.780]  and that's all they know and that's all they're you know what they're all about uh they don't care
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:47.300]  about the lives that that were affected uh procrastination it has caused many many first
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:54.740]  responders to become uh very much ill and also to die and yes i'm saying it and also to die
[02:03:55.380 --> 02:04:02.100]  okay uh i'm i'm not done okay i'm just beginning i've been sitting back waiting you know john
[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:07.060]  field has been great you know in the lead he's starting to get frustrated uh we've both been
[02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:13.540]  at town hall listening to all the the the bull that's been handed to us about first responders
[02:04:13.540 --> 02:04:18.900]  who have cancer and they're not going to be covered in there's a quota bill well mr mr groffalo

[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:28.660]  all right we're finishing up with joey garofalo survivor of 9 11 of somebody who went in and
[02:08:29.380 --> 02:08:32.900]  you after the things that collapsed in that dangerous environment where some of people got
[02:08:32.900 --> 02:08:39.380]  hurt and killed and he survived the deadly dust now they've had mount sinai and other prestigious
[02:08:39.380 --> 02:08:44.900]  medical and university facilities going back eight years scan their lungs and say it's unbelievable
[02:08:44.900 --> 02:08:50.020]  you guys are still alive so many of them have died the government's tried to block their
[02:08:50.020 --> 02:08:53.780]  health care finally said okay we'll give you health care but you've got to be run through a
[02:08:53.780 --> 02:08:59.540]  terror database what do you think of that joey that you know you guys aren't just now barred
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:04.820]  because they're done using you to make themselves look like heroes from the 10th anniversary all
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:13.140]  the first responders police fire medical you name it but now on top of it you've got to go
[02:09:13.140 --> 02:09:16.980]  through a terror database if you try to get health care now they're saying we're not going to cover
[02:09:16.980 --> 02:09:25.300]  cancer the main thing you need taking care of yeah alex you know they are so confused first of
[02:09:25.300 --> 02:09:30.900]  number one going through a terror database i mean that was known from day one in this agro to bill
[02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:37.700]  which i had been screaming about from when the bill first came out i am not totally against it
[02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:44.580]  because listen i'm an american and i believe in protecting this country and um i mean i'm not
[02:09:44.580 --> 02:09:51.460]  going to go into any more semantics other than that but it could be done a little bit better yes
[02:09:51.460 --> 02:09:57.860]  that's one um the second party a question was i'm sorry go through a terror database to to get
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:10:02.180]  health care i mean i know they're trying to make the unions go through them now i mean do we have to
[02:10:02.180 --> 02:10:10.820]  get federal permission to go to the bathroom well like i said the procedure and how they're going
[02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:18.660]  about doing it is wrong but to be part on you know to be part of a database is you know really for
[02:10:18.660 --> 02:10:24.100]  me it's not a problem i have nothing to worry about no obviously you've got to be on a database to get
[02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:30.100]  the special health care program i get that but but there's no need to to approve you through a
[02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:33.300]  terror database i mean you don't get approved through a terror database when you get your
[02:10:33.300 --> 02:10:38.340]  social security check it's a very dangerous president they're setting up so so why that's
[02:10:38.340 --> 02:10:43.460]  what i'm talking about yeah are there should be no procedure as far as that goes i'm already
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:50.100]  cleared i'm already a first responder i'm already sick i already got the coverage now nine years later
[02:10:50.100 --> 02:10:56.900]  that you want to change it oh now i see the point you're making so it's even worse now now specifically
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:03.300]  here in closing anything else you'd like to add a and then b uh more on the word you've gotten
[02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:08.660]  that there will be some demonstrations or first responders doing a chain around ground zero
[02:11:08.660 --> 02:11:15.220]  this is what i'm told um whether it comes to fruition or not you know it's another story
[02:11:15.780 --> 02:11:23.780]  um i you know i am i'm not going to be there you know as part of it i will be close by um
[02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:30.980]  but you know in all in all you know what if they do make arrests um you know what shame on them
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:37.860]  they're taking away you know entitlements they're taking away rights listen they robbed us already
[02:11:37.860 --> 02:11:44.980]  um you know from from the whole history of nine one one which is another story
[02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:50.580]  alex and um i just wrote a piece on it there are a lot of educators in a lot of schools and across
[02:11:50.580 --> 02:11:54.420]  the country that want to start doing education and teaching our children how do you do that when
[02:11:54.420 --> 02:12:03.700]  the history is not even over um i mean and and we're just starting we're just beginning um i mean
[02:12:03.700 --> 02:12:10.580]  i'm just like it's been dated with with emails and and people crying and and and please help and
[02:12:11.220 --> 02:12:14.980]  you know they didn't know anything about like i mentioned the the fiberglass poisoning which
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:20.100]  i have and now you know it's coming to light to a lot of um first responders
[02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:25.380]  well complaining they were also complaining that they're being mistreated by the treatment centers
[02:12:25.380 --> 02:12:30.420]  just recently um wherever it is starting to go back for the annual um
[02:12:30.420 --> 02:12:39.300]  um uh testing and uh basically the exams you know cover a lot and now they're starting to
[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:46.740]  ask everyone to produce the medical records that we've produced uh when we first joined
[02:12:46.740 --> 02:12:54.980]  whether it be with my case in 2006 or others in 2002 or four they want everyone to reproduce
[02:12:54.980 --> 02:12:59.780]  so this is what i'm saying there they're starting all over again and they're doing it you know
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:08.260]  after the fact for what purpose well it's all part of harassing you it's all part of it's all part of
[02:13:08.260 --> 02:13:15.940]  medical discrimination alex and i'm going to scream this until people start listening this is medical
[02:13:15.940 --> 02:13:22.420]  discrimination because of the political bully because of the pimps that are out there that don't
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:30.580]  want to fess up or own up to their responsibility and paying for what we deserve you know to be
[02:13:31.140 --> 02:13:35.060]  taken care of well that's it they just want you to go away and that's not going to happen and
[02:13:35.780 --> 02:13:40.660]  i challenge you to go down there and to speak out and the police try to tell you hey you got to
[02:13:40.660 --> 02:13:45.140]  have a permit hey you don't have to have a permit and tell them hey your next buddy if they'll flush
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:51.060]  us down the toilet they're going to do it to you and let's see if the police and others go along
[02:13:51.060 --> 02:13:56.020]  with this and we'll certainly check in with you in the aftermath joey thank you so much we'll be
[02:13:56.020 --> 02:14:02.100]  we'll be tracking what happens at ground zero in eight days can i say two seconds of a last
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:09.700]  sentence sure my biggest fear is the future of our children and our unborn children alex
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:17.620]  and actually our first responders who are active today it should this you know take place again
[02:14:17.620 --> 02:14:24.420]  and how are they going to respond what will they do knowing how we will all be mistreated
[02:14:24.420 --> 02:14:30.020]  and discriminated against that's my biggest fear well if you fight back against it you'll
[02:14:30.020 --> 02:14:34.900]  just be the new terrorist they've already branded away from al qaeda on to the returning veterans
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:39.540]  gun owners libertarians conservative so it's all part of their plan thank you so much joey we'll

[02:15:46.980 --> 02:15:54.100]  he um has had the feds tell him and give him the documents that they're not in trouble for buying
[02:15:54.100 --> 02:15:58.580]  wood that's endangered they admit this up the case but that it's violating international
[02:15:58.580 --> 02:16:05.060]  law that they worked the wood here and because it's an end-in law they're now under that
[02:16:05.060 --> 02:16:11.620]  internationally even though the indians say that they haven't uh violated it so we've got
[02:16:12.500 --> 02:16:19.140]  that issue but the big bombshell is that in court and they have the report
[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:26.500]  is that when they complained about it the feds told him in a brief in paper in court
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:32.020]  they said just leave the united states then go to madagascar if you don't like this so
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:37.140]  they do want to get rid of american jobs one of the few companies still making high-quality

[02:17:28.500 --> 02:17:36.340]  ron paul feds preparing for breakdown of law and order presidential candidate warrants of
[02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:42.020]  government power grab in time of crisis asked about his recent comments regarding how authorities
[02:17:42.020 --> 02:17:46.500]  united states were setting the stage for violence in this country presidential candidate ron paul
[02:17:46.500 --> 02:17:50.420]  elaborated another federal government was preparing for a breakdown of law and order
[02:17:50.420 --> 02:17:54.180]  quote they're planning for any provision paul told alex shown show adding that the federal
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:59.460]  government is very much aware of history and collapsing societies you can have a breakdown
[02:17:59.460 --> 02:18:04.500]  of law and order so that people will unfortunately be begging for stabilization and they'll be
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:11.140]  inviting the federal government to come in and destabilize things so i think they're making
[02:18:11.140 --> 02:18:17.300]  plans now along those lines hear that to have the federal government come in and destabilize
[02:18:17.300 --> 02:18:22.820]  things so the congressman report responding to a question about whether such preparations were
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:28.580]  about a power grab on behalf of the federal government paul responded that's their goal
[02:18:28.580 --> 02:18:35.940]  it's all about power i said so specifically sir we heard yesterday i said they want the crisis so
[02:18:35.940 --> 02:18:42.420]  they get power and he said that's their goal it's all about power like i think he went yep he said
[02:18:42.420 --> 02:18:47.060]  yes that's their goal it's all about powers we might get the full quote in there uh continuing
[02:18:47.060 --> 02:18:52.580]  when pressed who they are paul named the federal emergency management agency who have come in
[02:18:53.620 --> 02:19:00.260]  or harsh criticism from the congressman in the aftermath of hurricane iran riots that emerged
[02:19:00.260 --> 02:19:06.420]  largely as a consequence of economic hardships have gripped europe and the middle east over the
[02:19:06.420 --> 02:19:13.220]  past 18 months although little significant unrest so far has been seen in the united states however
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:17.940]  many expect the situation to only become more volatile as america teeters on the break of a
[02:19:17.940 --> 02:19:22.500]  double-dip recession i love how paul's using the term double-dip recession teetering on the edge
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:27.540]  we've been in been in one we're in a depression we're in all the economists we talk to but i think

[02:23:18.820 --> 02:23:27.060]  spot the dangerous food shortage trends number three take decisive action a perfect storm is brewing
[02:23:27.060 --> 02:23:33.060]  or a global food crisis that's why i'm telling everyone to read the new book rising prices

[02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:08.740]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a
[02:24:08.740 --> 02:24:10.180]  war on for your mind
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:20.100]  all right here's a clip from our upcoming interview with henry jescuitz the ceo
[02:24:20.100 --> 02:24:25.380]  of gibson when he dropped the bombshell the u.s government said leave america get out of here
[02:24:25.380 --> 02:24:31.540]  we don't want you here it is now the concerns i've seen in in some of the newspapers point out
[02:24:31.540 --> 02:24:38.420]  that under the lacy act uh and and and the federal government's on record you know when you try to
[02:24:38.420 --> 02:24:42.580]  fly out of the country with a wooden guitar they don't care how old it is if you don't have the
[02:24:42.580 --> 02:24:48.820]  proof of of where it came from that they're they're confiscating them can you speak to that
[02:24:50.020 --> 02:24:57.540]  it's you know it's quite ridiculous uh the fact is what it the the law is is that you have to know
[02:24:57.540 --> 02:25:05.700]  what every material component in the product is and where it came from so in other words every
[02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:13.460]  single piece of wood uh the the bridge the fingerboard uh the body you know these are all different
[02:25:13.460 --> 02:25:20.500]  woods that have come from different sources you as a guitar owner if you want to transport that
[02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:29.380]  want to transport that guitar across borders have to know exactly where each piece of wood came from
[02:25:29.380 --> 02:25:36.900]  and what species it is uh which is frankly impossible for an average person to know uh
[02:25:37.460 --> 02:25:43.700]  and on an old guitar we don't even know that i mean though that we don't keep records going back
[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:49.540]  you know decades uh on on the specifics well i was reading because it's not just gibson it's all the
[02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:55.460]  uh wooden instruments violins cellos you name it that people like willy nelson and i know personally
[02:25:55.460 --> 02:26:00.580]  they he won't take his prized wooden guitars out of the country he won't take trigger that he got
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:07.380]  over 60 years ago out of the country because reportedly they're grabbing most the guitars
[02:26:07.380 --> 02:26:12.180]  people try to take into canada or fly to europe for a show and and now the feds are saying
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:20.660]  uh pianos uh furniture uh firearms stocks i mean this sounds like it's a giant power grab
[02:26:21.220 --> 02:26:25.940]  and and it looks like the u.s is the only country in the world acting like this with a renewable
[02:26:25.940 --> 02:26:37.140]  resource like wood it is it is really unprecedented and it's unfair uh it's um i just can't believe
[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:46.100]  it's happening in this country in closing how can we support uh a american icon company like gibson
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:51.700]  uh i mean how do we keep you here in the u.s because uh doing my own investigation if you're
[02:26:51.700 --> 02:26:58.100]  based overseas you seem to get left alone and our government just bends over backwards even
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:02.820]  congressman kasinich said two days ago on cnn that the head of the president's economic council
[02:27:02.820 --> 02:27:08.820]  the former head of g e uh is great at creating jobs overseas that a lot of the stimulus money and
[02:27:08.820 --> 02:27:15.460]  bailout money is going to move general electrics x-ray division to china to move general motors
[02:27:15.460 --> 02:27:24.260]  factories to china uh what's going on here well you know in the government itself in a brief uh
[02:27:24.260 --> 02:27:33.220]  specifically said uh in our court case that we should move to madagascar and make guitars excuse
[02:27:33.220 --> 02:27:41.460]  me hold on hold hold the press is sir ceo of gibson since 1986 you're telling me and i know you've
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:46.180]  got these uh press release on gibson but i would love to see a copy of this i believe you that they
[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:54.900]  specifically said leave america that we would be better off manufacturing guitars and madagascar

[02:33:37.620 --> 02:33:42.820]  libya be engulfed in flames it is a civil war a humanitarian disaster as colonel shaffer and
[02:33:42.820 --> 02:33:49.060]  others predicted as we predicted as well kadafi said to be in desert town reportedly his family
[02:33:49.060 --> 02:33:54.340]  got out last week he could have left he's deciding to stand and fight say what you want about him
[02:33:54.340 --> 02:33:58.980]  he's certainly not like the globalist scumbags we have running things who are cowardly on top of
[02:33:58.980 --> 02:34:06.020]  being scum something more respectable about being a a a dictator who will actually fight
[02:34:06.020 --> 02:34:12.340]  also rebels claim to be closing in the al-qaeda rebels i'm supposed to love i don't like kadafi
[02:34:12.340 --> 02:34:18.100]  or them sorry and i really don't like al-qaeda because i'm a bad person i guess also they've
[02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:22.740]  extended the rebel deadline another week now this news is up on info wars dot com as well but
[02:34:22.740 --> 02:34:30.180]  drudge arranges it so well now if you scroll down this news was up there yesterday drudge report
[02:34:30.180 --> 02:34:36.820]  has it man faces life in jail for recording police i'm glad the folks over the drudge report realize
[02:34:36.820 --> 02:34:42.260]  that's a big article uh and we point to local newscast where they say it's illegal to take police
[02:34:42.260 --> 02:34:46.980]  and we wrote an article exposing that it's a hoax and the cops know full well it's not illegal
[02:34:46.980 --> 02:34:52.100]  which is really scary if anything gets me scared most of these cops i know mean well and got a
[02:34:52.100 --> 02:34:58.500]  tough job in some areas they're actual criminals and trying to put a guy life in prison i mean one
[02:34:58.500 --> 02:35:02.180]  thing if it was a corrupt cop didn't want something taped and grabbed a camera away or something that's
[02:35:02.180 --> 02:35:08.020]  bad enough they're gonna put him in jail for prison i mean for life and then under it drudge link to
[02:35:08.020 --> 02:35:15.460]  our latest article appeals court rules it is not illegal to film police and we'll show folks
[02:35:15.460 --> 02:35:21.540]  uh that article as well so double linked up on drudge and i've asked everybody to go get these
[02:35:21.540 --> 02:35:27.860]  articles and get them out to everybody you know both the article about man faces life in jail
[02:35:27.860 --> 02:35:36.420]  for recording police publicly publicly and the second article appeals court rules it is not
[02:35:36.420 --> 02:35:43.620]  illegal to film police despite the mass hoax still being promulgated by the mainstream media and local
[02:35:43.620 --> 02:35:48.340]  authorities across america the first circuit court of appeals is ruled that is not illegal
[02:35:48.340 --> 02:35:53.780]  for citizens to videotape police officers when they're on public duty really no kidding there's no
[02:35:53.780 --> 02:36:00.020]  presumption of privacy in public that that's that's common law that that's just that here's what's
[02:36:00.020 --> 02:36:05.860]  scary when we did the research for this article yesterday the first article there are literally
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:11.940]  hundreds of court cases federal and state where the cops arrest people in the last few years and it
[02:36:11.940 --> 02:36:18.580]  gets thrown out but rarely does it get thrown out at the county level it has to go to a higher court
[02:36:18.580 --> 02:36:24.820]  what suddenly happened to our local courts where these prosecutors know full well there's no presumption
[02:36:24.820 --> 02:36:34.260]  of privacy in public that's how the police tape us i mean it really is scary that in 12 states
[02:36:34.260 --> 02:36:40.340]  you've got crook cops and crook prosecutors and they had to go to one of the top federal courts
[02:36:40.340 --> 02:36:43.780]  i mean above that appellate is the supreme court
[02:36:46.420 --> 02:36:52.100]  i mean how would a cop sleep at night how would a prosecutor was some auto mechanic with no
[02:36:52.100 --> 02:36:59.700]  criminal record and you're trying to put him in a box in a cage for life i feel bad when i travel and
[02:36:59.700 --> 02:37:04.900]  put the dogs in a travel cage for five hours driving because they don't like it and i can't
[02:37:04.900 --> 02:37:12.420]  communicate with them and they think they're in trouble i mean how on earth where is your basic
[02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:19.860]  humanity what well where is it in north korea or nazi germany or soviet russia or china i mean
[02:37:19.860 --> 02:37:26.580]  it usually it isn't there if you let corrupt people get in they will recruit more corrupt people
[02:37:26.580 --> 02:37:33.140]  and we'll all be slaves i'm gonna say it right here this miscarriage of justice this false
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:40.420]  prosecution this official oppression this false arrest appropriately manipulating juries and lying
[02:37:40.420 --> 02:37:44.260]  to them people are getting convicted going to jail for that stuff who don't have money and don't
[02:37:44.260 --> 02:37:52.420]  know their rights these police are guilty of all sorts of different crimes racketeering official
[02:37:52.420 --> 02:37:57.380]  oppression i call it modern day slavery putting in one of these prison factories you know buildings
[02:37:57.380 --> 02:38:03.860]  tough for 25 cents an hour until prosecutors start getting indicted and until cops start
[02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:08.980]  getting indicted for this none of us are safe because i've know three cases where my listeners
[02:38:08.980 --> 02:38:17.620]  have been arrested for absolutely no reason for giving out my videos and then when i have called
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:24.260]  and talked to the newspaper reporters the judges involved they go no mr rushing was very polite
[02:38:24.260 --> 02:38:30.020]  didn't do anything but they see these videos as threatening to police and charging with
[02:38:30.020 --> 02:38:38.580]  terroristic threats for ron paul speech in one of my films i mean and and and then after he beat
[02:38:38.580 --> 02:38:45.700]  him in court that's a rural area he and his buddy were riding horses one sunday afternoon
[02:38:45.700 --> 02:38:55.060]  and they arrested him for drunken riding a horse and kelly didn't drink he's not a drinker and i i
[02:38:55.060 --> 02:39:00.420]  couldn't believe that so i call people randomly out of the online phone book in the town i mean
[02:39:00.420 --> 02:39:05.700]  they're like upstanding goody tissues so next the state police took him to jail for riding horses
[02:39:05.700 --> 02:39:16.180]  drunk i mean this what what happened to these men that they are so low down and have no honor that
[02:39:17.700 --> 02:39:24.020]  that you would want to do something to somebody for no reason who's done nothing to you and that
[02:39:24.020 --> 02:39:32.900]  you could sleep at night trying to put somebody in jail now most police are not like that i'm
[02:39:32.900 --> 02:39:38.740]  going to tell you right now that the system is trying to convert police over to this i'm going
[02:39:38.740 --> 02:39:44.260]  to be honest i've sold this story i've run into la pd on the street they're alex jones we love your
[02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:49.380]  show uh new york you know cops that do know me are nice others act like dugs that's that's really
[02:39:49.380 --> 02:39:56.180]  the worst place i've been uh i've been pulled over by the state police i don't know probably seven
[02:39:56.180 --> 02:40:06.260]  times in the last 10 years and i've been let off all but twice i have had austin police let me off
[02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:14.020]  tickets repeatedly this happened a few months ago so and i'm not saying that's the mark of a good
[02:40:14.020 --> 02:40:17.460]  cop let me out of a ticket but you know tell me they're listeners of the show we'll just drive
[02:40:17.460 --> 02:40:22.020]  safer i'm gonna give you a warning i get most people are warning well but you know the one time one
[02:40:22.020 --> 02:40:28.020]  pulled me over he goes well i i'm gonna still give you a ticket uh but i like your show and that was
[02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:33.300]  out by near crawford i mean you're driving through cornfields and there's a school way back up some
[02:40:33.300 --> 02:40:38.340]  gravel road and you don't see a little 40 mile you're going 60 it goes to 40 and then back to 60
[02:40:38.340 --> 02:40:42.740]  clearly a speed trap and i said this is a speed trap you know and he goes well that's what it's
[02:40:42.740 --> 02:40:46.020]  marked i like your show by the way i heard this part of the show but i'm still giving you the
[02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:50.020]  ticket am i gonna give you any favors and then i didn't have my insurance it was out of date and
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:55.300]  he goes no i believe you got insurance so i guess he uh yeah yeah look and i'm not saying that's the
[02:40:55.300 --> 02:40:59.140]  mark of a good cop that they like me or nice to me i know most of you're just do after doing a job
[02:40:59.700 --> 02:41:04.820]  but man you've got to speak out against trying to put some auto mechanic in jail for life
[02:41:04.820 --> 02:41:12.340]  over videotaping i mean is that the country you want your kids growing up in and uh 12 states are
[02:41:12.340 --> 02:41:16.740]  doing it i mean they're arresting people and it's spreading just six months ago or so it was like

[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:54.980]  violence so that they can bring in martial law the fema camp issue rick perry's a phony globalist
[02:42:54.980 --> 02:43:00.820]  what was the term flip-flopper that's some powerful info we need to get paul attacking
[02:43:00.820 --> 02:43:05.300]  the people that are trying to become him and it's finally rick perry was at a top republican
[02:43:05.300 --> 02:43:11.460]  fundraiser last night um it's in my politics stack i may have time to get to it and top donors were
[02:43:11.460 --> 02:43:18.420]  like you worked for you for al gore and you supported hillary his latest 93 94 and socialist
[02:43:18.420 --> 02:43:24.180]  health care and now they're learning he was anti gun when he was in the state legislature
[02:43:24.180 --> 02:43:29.060]  they're now learning he's for totally open borders i mean look i'd rather just keep obama
[02:43:29.060 --> 02:43:33.940]  i mean if i'm gonna get rick perry i'd rather have someone who at least you know parades around
[02:43:33.940 --> 02:43:38.740]  with their socialism uh you know for the elite to steal our money i mean i hate obama but folks
[02:43:38.740 --> 02:43:43.540]  are waking up to him he has an all-time low approval rating don't give me some fake ronald reagan

[02:48:34.980 --> 02:48:40.420]  response to a one of your callers that called in about two days ago stating that she had a pharmacist
[02:48:40.420 --> 02:48:46.740]  friend um that stated she had to meet quotas for some vaccinations um i'm actually a pharmacist
[02:48:46.740 --> 02:48:52.580]  currently practicing up here in canada um and i manage a pharmacy owned by one of the large
[02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:59.140]  chains and i basically i can confirm this yeah they tell you you've got to push it on them how
[02:48:59.140 --> 02:49:02.980]  like we go to barns and nobles and they keep saying take the loyalty card take the loyalty
[02:49:02.980 --> 02:49:06.980]  card don't you want the loyalty card and it's the same thing uh yeah i need to get uh that
[02:49:06.980 --> 02:49:12.580]  prescription i'm medicine please don't you want the shot it's so good for you i'm sorry go ahead
[02:49:12.580 --> 02:49:17.220]  tell us tell us what you can confirm well i mean in canada anyways i don't know what's on there but
[02:49:17.220 --> 02:49:22.260]  almost all pharmacists are now required to um have at least one pharmacist that is licensed to
[02:49:22.260 --> 02:49:27.700]  perform injections um the government up here in the past year has been training pharmacists actually
[02:49:27.700 --> 02:49:32.580]  to inject um in order to prepare for the coming epidemic and they're actually telling us this
[02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:37.700]  like they're training all of these pharmacists and they've got movies coming out about how it's
[02:49:37.700 --> 02:49:42.660]  coming and then they'll have lots of plagues only kill a few hundred thousand then a few million it'll
[02:49:42.660 --> 02:49:48.340]  get worse each each phase though yep and like i said well i don't actually have a quota i am really
[02:49:48.340 --> 02:49:53.460]  being pushed hard to to encourage vaccinations particularly flu and Gardasil like it even goes
[02:49:53.460 --> 02:49:58.980]  so far as to print out automatically uh print out for any person getting birth control filled
[02:49:58.980 --> 02:50:03.060]  and it will state then it'll tell these girls they're in danger of HPV and that they should
[02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:07.700]  talk with their pharmacist about administering the vaccine and i guess basically the reason i'm
[02:50:07.700 --> 02:50:11.940]  calling is just to tell you that you're you're right on the mark like always um on this thank you
[02:50:11.940 --> 02:50:18.100]  sir i mean what's happening is this is the new model of global health care doctors and pharmacists
[02:50:18.100 --> 02:50:23.700]  and experts you aren't in charge now because you actually have the knowledge the big corporates
[02:50:23.700 --> 02:50:29.620]  instruct you on what you can and can't do i mean i'm sure you've read the insert for the Gardasil
[02:50:29.620 --> 02:50:34.500]  they even admit doesn't isn't proven to protect you can't hurt you i mean isn't that incredible
[02:50:35.060 --> 02:50:39.380]  yep it is it totally is and they're telling us you know to encourage us particularly in pregnant
[02:50:39.380 --> 02:50:43.380]  women and and yet the most people that are telling us and and other pharmacists that i know aren't
[02:50:43.380 --> 02:50:47.460]  giving it to their own families like i don't i didn't give it to my own wife hold on stay there
[02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:54.180]  hold on stay there i gotta call her listen on WBCR 1470 uh there and uh outside Knoxville we're

[02:55:27.860 --> 02:55:34.420]  here um i was up here till 11 last night uh let's go ahead and finish up with shawn
[02:55:35.220 --> 02:55:40.580]  shawn it'd be cool to have uh doctors nurses pharmacists on sometime but you know the issue
[02:55:40.580 --> 02:55:45.940]  i was raising is they'll do these little insert printouts at wall green cvs and others and it'll
[02:55:45.940 --> 02:55:51.940]  say great shot flu protects you it isn't the real drug sheet though so people say hey this says it's
[02:55:51.940 --> 02:56:00.100]  safe liar i'm like no read the actual insert to hear about the guillomb array and cancer and death
[02:56:00.100 --> 02:56:06.020]  as a pharmacist who knows more on average than a doctor you know of the pharmacia explain to people
[02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:11.860]  if i'm telling the truth or not that the the fact sheet they give you is not the information that's
[02:56:11.860 --> 02:56:20.260]  on the actual drug insert it is nothing to do with the actual drug insert it's basically the company
[02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:25.700]  paying whatever um company that they're paying in this case rex or wall wall greens in order to
[02:56:25.700 --> 02:56:30.660]  push their product it's an advertisement for their product essentially is what it is saying get this
[02:56:30.660 --> 02:56:35.300]  you need this to protect you it is not the actual insert it doesn't go over any of the the potential
[02:56:35.300 --> 02:56:42.740]  side effects it is you're right exactly well we need pharmacists and others not that's the problem
[02:56:42.740 --> 02:56:48.020]  with it not being little local pharmacists you trust anymore but all these megamarts they admit
[02:56:48.020 --> 02:56:53.700]  that's the only thing expanding in our economy now is not even walmart uh it's only uh cvs and
[02:56:53.700 --> 02:56:58.420]  wall greens that's the biggest retail expansion i mean i live out in the country and there's two of
[02:56:58.420 --> 02:57:04.100]  them there's two of them i mean i live out with cows around me you're driving down you know road
[02:57:04.100 --> 02:57:08.420]  onto off a dirt road onto a main road and then there's the drug store with everybody there getting
[02:57:08.420 --> 02:57:14.660]  their drugs and uh every pharmacist i know says the same thing my dad's a physician he says the
[02:57:14.660 --> 02:57:19.300]  same thing but i always say read the insert so since i've been saying that and others have they go
[02:57:19.300 --> 02:57:24.740]  well i got the insert when i got it and you're lying it doesn't say that that's the little drug company
[02:57:24.740 --> 02:57:32.500]  baloney sheet but by law they've still got to have the actual little paper folded up in tiny print
[02:57:32.500 --> 02:57:38.660]  on both sides what do they call those sheets pharmacist uh well just like a like a drug
[02:57:38.660 --> 02:57:44.660]  information sheet and official product monograph yeah exactly it'll even have the molecule of the
[02:57:44.660 --> 02:57:49.620]  drug on the back correct exactly and if it doesn't have that what you're basically saying is is an
[02:57:49.620 --> 02:57:55.140]  advertisement for for the product it's all it is other pharmacists you talk to that's why i wanted
[02:57:55.140 --> 02:57:59.860]  to hold you over and we appreciate your time sir you're saying they don't take it themselves a lot
[02:57:59.860 --> 02:58:03.060]  of them that i know don't i mean there's always those that are just brainwashed into the system i
[02:58:03.060 --> 02:58:07.220]  mean they're telling us it's good give it out um but i know like in my case i didn't give it to
[02:58:07.220 --> 02:58:11.140]  when the h1n one scare was on they were really pushing it to give pregnant women and and i know
[02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:14.420]  i didn't give it to my wife and i recommend that patients that come in here that they that they
[02:58:14.420 --> 02:58:19.540]  don't get them but that's my next point every physician every pharmacist is taught until two
[02:58:19.540 --> 02:58:27.220]  years ago never give a vaccine to a pregnant woman correct correct sir you're right you're right and
[02:58:27.220 --> 02:58:32.980]  now that now they're pushing them as of particularly last year when folks it causes it it causes it it
[02:58:32.980 --> 02:58:36.820]  is so incredible call me back again one minute break i gotta take a few more and that's it five

[03:00:22.340 --> 03:00:30.100]  it's wb cr great folks down there welcome 1470 listener well thank you alex appreciate you taking
[03:00:30.100 --> 03:00:36.340]  my call i wanted to stay on the tenth anniversary of 9 11 how vitally important it is for everyone
[03:00:36.340 --> 03:00:42.180]  to get this information out as much as possible the people are ready to listen my wife and i
[03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:48.740]  set up a table in a very public place frequented by people from all over the eastern united states
[03:00:48.740 --> 03:00:55.860]  and uh we get all kinds of uh eager eager people interested in finding out this information
[03:00:56.980 --> 03:01:02.660]  one of the lines on our sign i i took directly from you which i think is an excellent summation
[03:01:02.660 --> 03:01:08.820]  of the whole problem i heard you say this one day on your show big government is the tool for
[03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:14.820]  corporate looting i think that's just an excellent summation of what we're facing well you could
[03:01:14.820 --> 03:01:19.940]  exactly if you study history you can have whatever great wishes you want and that's why i say the
[03:01:19.940 --> 03:01:26.340]  road to hell is paved with good intentions big things can do a lot of good but big things
[03:01:26.340 --> 03:01:33.540]  can do a lot of bad and bad people always lust after getting control of big powerful systems
[03:01:33.540 --> 03:01:38.100]  and so you build a big giant structure maybe a good guy or good woman's in control for a while
[03:01:38.100 --> 03:01:46.820]  but slowly lustful people get into control and misuse that power i mean even in small organizations
[03:01:47.380 --> 03:01:52.900]  you'll get people if you have power that you catch under you misusing it i don't have anybody doing
[03:01:52.900 --> 03:01:58.500]  that today but i've had definitely had people in here before i had to learn by experience uh it's
[03:01:58.500 --> 03:02:03.060]  like spider-man's uncle says with great power comes great responsibility and big government
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:09.460]  doesn't work unless you call enslaving and stealing and creating giant corporate combines but i didn't
[03:02:09.460 --> 03:02:14.180]  discover any of this thomas jefferson talked about you know if we ever let these big private banks
[03:02:14.180 --> 03:02:18.580]  control the issuance of our currency they're going to transfer all power to themselves and we're
[03:02:18.580 --> 03:02:25.860]  going to be slaves i wondered if you're aware yet that you are now being personally attacked on the
[03:02:25.860 --> 03:02:34.100]  pages of the american free press by victor thorn i could care less man i mean it's look there are
[03:02:34.100 --> 03:02:41.060]  a lot of people that are just heavy-duty jealous of me uh and i guess because they didn't work till
[03:02:41.060 --> 03:02:47.220]  11 o'clock last night and they didn't get up at 5 a.m this morning i mean most people wake up sick
[03:02:47.220 --> 03:02:52.740]  they they don't come in to work me i cough some blood up and you know having nose bleed and get
[03:02:52.740 --> 03:02:59.780]  my butt in here i'm not playing games with people and and and i'm because i realize what's what's
[03:02:59.780 --> 03:03:06.180]  happening and what's going on and uh of course i'm attacked of course stuff goes on constantly
[03:03:06.980 --> 03:03:12.980]  and that's because a lot of people are co-intel pro or operatives i don't know who or which people
[03:03:12.980 --> 03:03:20.100]  like hell turner and others always try to attack who they see as the as the as the as the big dog
[03:03:20.100 --> 03:03:24.660]  because if they attack the big dog maybe the big dog will talk about them and then they'll get
[03:03:24.660 --> 03:03:28.740]  you know some of what the big dogs got but you know what you don't want to have what the big
[03:03:28.740 --> 03:03:33.460]  dogs got you don't want to have the black circles around your eyes you don't want to have the obsession
[03:03:33.460 --> 03:03:39.300]  with news and information you don't want to be so addicted to truth and liberty that you can't do
[03:03:39.300 --> 03:03:46.020]  anything else but fight tyranny i am someone completely given over to resistance to tyranny
[03:03:46.020 --> 03:03:50.820]  and i'm saying you don't want that people out there that are just looking for power and notoriety
[03:03:50.820 --> 03:03:56.580]  and their name to get out there you wouldn't know what to do with it if you had it for 10 seconds
[03:03:56.580 --> 03:04:04.340]  you wouldn't know what the burden of true service is you wouldn't have any idea okay and and that
[03:04:04.340 --> 03:04:08.740]  it's a responsibility so whatever i don't even know you're talking about there's all sorts of
[03:04:08.740 --> 03:04:13.300]  people out there that attack me 24 7 and make up a million different lies and there's all these other
[03:04:13.300 --> 03:04:20.900]  websites that will amalgamate all the lies that even contradict each other and and and great good
[03:04:20.900 --> 03:04:27.620]  because it isn't about alex jones i'm here on a mission to wake people up to not trust the system
[03:04:27.620 --> 03:04:34.500]  and get involved and get informed and try to restore basic liberty and that's what i'm doing
