[00:00:05.157 --> 00:00:09.999]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.999 --> 00:00:11.579]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.140]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.321]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:21.383]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:43.104 --> 00:00:51.029]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we are, the final broadcast of the year 2009.
[00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:56.093]  It came and went with a flash, a twinkling of an eye, just like our lives will.
[00:00:56.093 --> 00:00:59.074]  You ever had a birthday party or a trip coming up?
[00:00:59.074 --> 00:01:01.156]  It's six months away, it feels like forever.
[00:01:02.722 --> 00:01:05.403]  But before you know it, the trip has come and gone.
[00:01:05.403 --> 00:01:07.425]  The party has come and gone.
[00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:13.848]  Just like this year went by so quickly, our lives will go by just as fast.
[00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:31.458]  You'll be there in your deathbed before you know it, or you'll be on the expressway watching that overturned 18-wheeler carrying natural gas exploding in a flash of flame in front of you the millisecond before you meet your maker.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.444]  Before you know it, you'll be out there playing golf and your left arm will go numb.
[00:01:38.444 --> 00:01:39.565]  You'll feel a terrible pain.
[00:01:39.565 --> 00:01:45.451]  You'll jolt back, slamming your head into the turf as your spirit leaves your body.
[00:01:48.370 --> 00:02:01.220]  We need to learn to enjoy life and to savor it and to appreciate it, to appreciate all the beauty, all the wonderment, all the majesty, all the love, all the innocence, everything that is good in life.
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:17.712]  Because just as this year, 2009, has sped past us, just as a rare blue moon visits this final day of the year 2009, the blue moon of death will come to all of our lives before we know it.
[00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:43.501]  Because the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, tens of billions of people who loved and lived and fought and struggled and built, who had passions, who had feuds, they've all come and gone before us, and one day soon we will join them in eternity.
[00:02:43.501 --> 00:02:46.662]  But for now, we're alive on this plane of existence,
[00:02:48.231 --> 00:03:10.441]  Spinning through space on a planet covered with deep blue oceans, high snow-capped mountains, deep green forests, birds in the sky, the ribbon in that girl's hair.
[00:03:10.441 --> 00:03:13.002]  Everything that is life.
[00:03:13.002 --> 00:03:15.563]  Transitory.
[00:03:15.563 --> 00:03:17.384]  So love your husband, love your wife,
[00:03:18.385 --> 00:03:21.307]  Love your father, love your mother.
[00:03:21.307 --> 00:03:30.873]  Forgive those who have unconsciously trespassed against you.
[00:03:30.873 --> 00:03:44.862]  But at the same time, stop spending all your time on issues of little or no significance that have been set before you as distractions from what life is really all about.
[00:03:44.862 --> 00:03:47.404]  Doesn't matter who wins the Big 12 in football.
[00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.090]  It doesn't matter how many mistresses Tiger Woods has.
[00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:13.016]  What matters is we have a wicked, controlling, scientific dictatorship establishing world governance for the express purpose of ushering in an electronic straitjacket, a cashless society, technological enslavement grid known as the New World Order.
[00:04:13.016 --> 00:04:17.257]  We have a group of our fellow humans who believe they are the predator class and it is their right
[00:04:18.962 --> 00:04:26.686]  As kings, to feed on free humanity, and to dumb us down, and to control our destiny.
[00:04:26.686 --> 00:04:30.168]  Because they want to control the destiny of this species.
[00:04:30.168 --> 00:04:34.250]  They know that you must have no control over your destiny.
[00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.591]  And that is a great crime.
[00:04:36.591 --> 00:04:37.652]  I believe in free will.
[00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:46.025]  And I believe that all men and women should control their destiny and be captains of their destiny as long as they don't hurt others.
[00:04:46.025 --> 00:04:51.208]  But when they attempt to enslave others, they become my mortal and eternal enemy.
[00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:59.252]  And as Thomas Jefferson said, I have sworn on the altar of God eternal resistance to all forms of tyranny over the minds of men!
[00:04:59.252 --> 00:05:00.693]  We shall return!
[00:05:00.973 --> 00:05:03.994]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:05:03.994 --> 00:05:09.317]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:05:09.317 --> 00:05:11.377]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:16.380]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.280]  How much do you want?
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:18.661]  When do you want it?
[00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:20.562]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:05:20.562 --> 00:05:21.623]  When will you need it?
[00:05:21.623 --> 00:05:23.824]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:05:23.824 --> 00:05:25.165]  Will there be any food?
[00:05:25.165 --> 00:05:26.706]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:31.970]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.552]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:05:35.552 --> 00:05:39.015]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:05:39.375 --> 00:05:40.596]  How much will you need?
[00:05:40.596 --> 00:05:41.497]  We don't know.
[00:05:41.497 --> 00:05:42.597]  How much do you want?
[00:05:42.597 --> 00:05:43.538]  All you can get.
[00:05:43.538 --> 00:05:44.619]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:05:44.619 --> 00:05:47.681]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:49.442]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:05:49.442 --> 00:05:50.383]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:07.014]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:07.014 --> 00:06:09.096]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[00:06:09.096 --> 00:06:11.318]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[00:06:11.318 --> 00:06:12.979]  And it's available right now to you.
[00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:17.462]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[00:06:17.462 --> 00:06:19.724]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.

[00:06:30.808 --> 00:06:33.649]  The Ecola Blue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:36.370]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.532]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.

[00:06:47.554 --> 00:06:47.815]  That's 1-800-691-6043.
[00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:49.736]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.156]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:07:05.156 --> 00:07:09.681]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:07:09.681 --> 00:07:11.964]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:07:11.964 --> 00:07:13.586]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:07:13.586 --> 00:07:14.627]  There is a solution.
[00:07:14.847 --> 00:07:23.274]  InterHealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:07:23.274 --> 00:07:30.739]  Try their InterFood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:07:30.739 --> 00:07:36.384]  It even won the award for best superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:07:36.544 --> 00:07:37.265]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.787 --> 00:08:08.549]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.549 --> 00:08:10.311]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.311 --> 00:08:11.892]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:13.454]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.454 --> 00:08:17.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.638 --> 00:08:21.702]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:40.304]  Alex Jones is a leading conspiracy expert and Bilderberg foe.
[00:08:40.304 --> 00:08:50.271]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here in Canada today to stand up against the Bilderberg group that is attempting to get rid of the sovereignty of the United States.
[00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:53.733]  And he's definitely made his presence known at the Bilderberg meetings.
[00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.174]  We're not your slaves!
[00:08:55.174 --> 00:08:57.255]  We don't belong to you!
[00:08:57.255 --> 00:09:00.197]  Your New World Order will fall!
[00:09:00.197 --> 00:09:03.039]  Jones adds a terrifying twist to the investigation.
[00:09:08.522 --> 00:09:11.204]  Alex, why are we meeting here?
[00:09:11.204 --> 00:09:17.169]  Because the information I want to talk to you about is important, and I wanted to talk to you privately.
[00:09:17.169 --> 00:09:18.811]  Well, this is certainly private.
[00:09:18.811 --> 00:09:19.811]  What do you got for me?
[00:09:19.811 --> 00:09:23.494]  The Big Kahuna.
[00:09:23.494 --> 00:09:24.435]  Which is?
[00:09:24.435 --> 00:09:27.518]  It's the science of controlling population.
[00:09:27.518 --> 00:09:36.025]  Throughout the show today, I'm going to play a clip of Dr. Stan Monteith in Jesse Ventura's Secret Society special, Dr. Stan Monteith.
[00:09:37.423 --> 00:09:40.444]  I'm going to play clips of David Icke from the special.
[00:09:40.444 --> 00:09:47.206]  I'm going to play clips from Dr. Rima Lebo from the special.
[00:09:47.206 --> 00:10:02.011]  The entire special is being posted in the next hour or so up at InfoWars.com in a blurb article that Aaron Dykes is putting together right now.
[00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:04.531]  We, of course, are going to have Year in Review 2009 today.
[00:10:07.264 --> 00:10:10.468]  We will have decade in review.
[00:10:10.468 --> 00:10:14.032]  Again, I can't put out this info consciously.
[00:10:14.032 --> 00:10:20.279]  Doesn't mean we don't make mistakes, but it is not the end of the decade, as the media is saying.
[00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.821]  The new millennium did not start.
[00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:23.222]  The new decade did not start.
[00:10:23.222 --> 00:10:24.864]  The new century did not start in 2000.
[00:10:26.889 --> 00:10:27.649]  January 1st, 2000.
[00:10:27.649 --> 00:10:29.830]  That's just not true.
[00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.571]  January 1st, 2001.
[00:10:31.571 --> 00:10:37.534]  But the media and the public have been saying since 98 that the new millennium began in 2000.
[00:10:37.534 --> 00:10:41.256]  And so, we will review the decade.
[00:10:41.256 --> 00:10:50.140]  And review the decade of lies, corruption, Big Brother, the language being destroyed, open lies being practiced like never before, the 9-11 lie.
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.461]  I mean, they claim they killed
[00:10:55.489 --> 00:11:04.113]  Different Al-Qaeda leaders, some of them 15, 20 times apiece, and they would never rescind the last time they killed him.
[00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:10.136]  And they would claim they captured Chemical Ali three, four, five times, then claim they killed him again, and then captured him again.
[00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:14.318]  I mean, they claim that this is the end of the decade, tonight at midnight.
[00:11:15.222 --> 00:11:16.583]  In your time zone?
[00:11:16.583 --> 00:11:17.024]  It's not.
[00:11:17.024 --> 00:11:18.965]  There's a whole other year left.
[00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:23.449]  They might come out next week and say there's 497 days in a year.
[00:11:23.449 --> 00:11:25.171]  There's 365.
[00:11:25.171 --> 00:11:28.994]  That's what it takes for the planet to orbit around the sun.
[00:11:28.994 --> 00:11:33.738]  But they might just say there's 5,000 days in a year.
[00:11:33.738 --> 00:11:40.944]  When the Illuminati took over France in the French Revolution, they went to a 10-day, then they changed it to a 9-day week.
[00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:47.953]  What, a 50-something day month?
[00:11:47.953 --> 00:11:49.455]  I mean, they're into that.
[00:11:49.455 --> 00:11:50.816]  They're into playing God.
[00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:52.277]  They're into genetic engineering.
[00:11:52.277 --> 00:11:54.138]  They're into weather manipulation.
[00:11:54.138 --> 00:11:59.123]  The globalists like to play God.
[00:11:59.123 --> 00:12:01.564]  So how do you have a decade in review when it's not a decade?
[00:12:01.564 --> 00:12:02.165]  Well, whatever.
[00:12:02.165 --> 00:12:07.750]  We're going to look at the last nine years, okay?
[00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:12.033]  Or, since they're trying to change the common era to decades and
[00:12:13.872 --> 00:12:19.813]  Centuries and millenniums ending a year before they really do.
[00:12:19.813 --> 00:12:24.014]  We'll just look at the... See, I'm starting to obsess over this.
[00:12:24.014 --> 00:12:25.554]  It doesn't matter.
[00:12:25.554 --> 00:12:26.435]  But it does matter.
[00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:28.535]  It's just everything is a fraud.
[00:12:28.535 --> 00:12:35.176]  They distort everything to where you can't even find out what the truth is anymore.
[00:12:35.176 --> 00:12:37.217]  I don't know what to think of last night's TV show.
[00:12:40.057 --> 00:12:42.859]  It is the episode that I feature most heavily in.
[00:12:42.859 --> 00:12:46.603]  I'm the only person that comes back repeatedly in different episodes.
[00:12:46.603 --> 00:12:58.153]  And I'm told if it gets picked up again, I'm going to be an even bigger part of the show, which I'm very honored to be the only person other than Jesse Ventura that's a repeat visitor to Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory.
[00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:04.798]  And I know that the crew have become completely convinced of the New World Order while making the film.
[00:13:04.798 --> 00:13:07.581]  I know Time Warner has had their fingers somewhat in it.
[00:13:09.091 --> 00:13:11.273]  And you can certainly see where that's manifest.
[00:13:11.273 --> 00:13:12.834]  It's done as entertainment.
[00:13:12.834 --> 00:13:18.417]  It's done with kind of a shocking, dramatized way.
[00:13:18.417 --> 00:13:22.720]  But this is dramatic, sensational material.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.403]  It is for, you know, designed for the general public.
[00:13:27.403 --> 00:13:30.966]  And I find it very entertaining.
[00:13:30.966 --> 00:13:33.748]  I mean, I don't usually watch entertainment shows.
[00:13:33.748 --> 00:13:35.189]  And I never watch reality TV.
[00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:36.449]  What I've seen of it, I hate.
[00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:38.131]  This is the best reality TV I've ever seen.
[00:13:39.618 --> 00:13:42.160]  But it is popcorn.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.483]  Popcorn for the brain, but it does actually have some vitamins in it.
[00:13:45.483 --> 00:13:47.464]  It's not devoid of information.
[00:13:47.464 --> 00:13:50.927]  In fact, it's chopped full of it.
[00:13:50.927 --> 00:13:59.634]  I was really tired last night, and I didn't feel like watching myself on television.
[00:13:59.634 --> 00:14:04.998]  I've been invited out to California to see some of the finished product of the TV shows, and I didn't even do that.
[00:14:06.007 --> 00:14:11.529]  I consulted on it heavily, one of the main consultants on the show.
[00:14:11.529 --> 00:14:19.852]  But then I watched some clips of it when I was out there doing shoots or brainstorms or recommending people for them.
[00:14:19.852 --> 00:14:27.034]  But I didn't want to watch it last night, so I didn't.
[00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:29.815]  I read a book instead.
[00:14:29.815 --> 00:14:34.117]  Hadn't read it in probably 15 years, so I read it, started reading A Tale of Two Cities.
[00:14:35.795 --> 00:14:37.997]  By Charles Dickens.
[00:14:37.997 --> 00:14:40.259]  It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.
[00:14:40.259 --> 00:14:42.862]  So it opens.
[00:14:42.862 --> 00:14:45.944]  And so I stayed up until about 11 reading that book.
[00:14:45.944 --> 00:14:50.448]  So I got up this morning and I did watch the TV show.
[00:14:50.448 --> 00:14:52.590]  And I almost don't know what to say.
[00:14:52.590 --> 00:14:57.454]  The Global Warming episode is as near to perfect as it can get.
[00:14:57.454 --> 00:14:59.496]  And that's the one I'm really proud of.
[00:14:59.496 --> 00:15:01.458]  I heavily consulted on that.
[00:15:04.801 --> 00:15:10.886]  I also massively consulted, recommended basically everybody you see interviewed.
[00:15:10.886 --> 00:15:17.050]  Monteef, Estalin, all of them.
[00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.652]  This is the top show right now on TruTV, by the way.
[00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.073]  And they re-air it all throughout the week.
[00:15:21.073 --> 00:15:22.394]  I was looking at the numbers.
[00:15:22.394 --> 00:15:26.497]  Upwards of 10 million people watch this a week.
[00:15:26.497 --> 00:15:32.742]  1.7 million when it first premieres, then over and over again, and they're going to keep re-airing the series.
[00:15:32.742 --> 00:15:32.922]  So...
[00:15:34.298 --> 00:15:43.805]  Conservatively, hundreds of millions will end up seeing this in the aggregate, in the sum total.
[00:15:43.805 --> 00:15:48.649]  And the TV show hasn't shaken me up.
[00:15:48.649 --> 00:15:54.113]  It's more... It hasn't scrambled my brain, that's not the word.
[00:15:54.113 --> 00:15:55.394]  I'm having to assess this.
[00:15:57.984 --> 00:16:08.333]  And I'm so busy with other issues, I just kind of have to give the problem to my brain and then let it marinate and percolate and a punch card will pop out.
[00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:09.253]  Might be 3 a.m.
[00:16:09.253 --> 00:16:10.895]  next week, might be an hour from now.
[00:16:10.895 --> 00:16:18.081]  I mean, I know all the different some parts of how this got on air, why it got on air.
[00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:21.664]  Some of what went on behind the scenes with Time Warner.
[00:16:21.664 --> 00:16:23.946]  What this signifies, them allowing this on air.
[00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:36.872]  Even though I featured myself personally more prominently in this episode than any other episode, this was my least favorite last night.
[00:16:36.872 --> 00:16:42.794]  But, it put out the most powerful info ever released on mainstream television.
[00:16:42.794 --> 00:16:43.234]  Ever.
[00:16:43.234 --> 00:16:51.016]  There's no debating that the cat was let out of the bag last night with this production.
[00:16:51.016 --> 00:16:57.038]  But then, as someone who's produced films and consults it on television shows,
[00:16:58.638 --> 00:17:23.644]  I consulted on Scanner Darkly, and I consulted on several other films and television shows, some of which I've signed non-disclosures on, but the point is, unless I can't talk about it, the point is, the others were so incredibly powerful and pure that when I say this is my least favorite, it doesn't mean I don't think it was good.
[00:17:23.644 --> 00:17:25.124]  I think it was great and groundbreaking.
[00:17:26.764 --> 00:17:37.513]  I have to say the Labo part, Dr. Rima Labo, who I really like, that is the one part.
[00:17:37.513 --> 00:17:39.335]  Because when they interviewed her three months ago,
[00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:48.425]  She really thought, you heard her live on air here, that no, we're going to have martial law and we're going to have these forced inoculations.
[00:17:48.425 --> 00:18:05.976]  And I said, well, Dr. Labo, from what I've seen in the past, sure, you've got the documents where they told that we were released, that we got, Bureau of Prisons getting ready for mass death, Bureau of Cemeteries getting ready for mass death, New York State, emergency managers in Indiana and Illinois,
[00:18:07.245 --> 00:18:13.694]  on record saying they were being told get ready for millions dead this was in january and february so they were getting ready
[00:18:15.131 --> 00:18:25.039]  But I said this could just be a drill to scare local police and constabulary into going under federal control, and then into scaring the public later into taking the shot, which will then have a soft kill.
[00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:31.885]  We know all the major vaccines do, but reading the insert for this vaccine, it admitted can cause Guillain-Barré, sterilize you, reduce fertility, give you cancer.
[00:18:31.885 --> 00:18:39.331]  I mean, it's admitted in the insert, but I said the way the soft kills work is this takes years to develop in most cases.
[00:18:39.331 --> 00:18:43.655]  Sure, thousands of people have had convulsions or gotten Guillain-Barré, and there's been some deaths.
[00:18:46.309 --> 00:18:51.413]  I've learned, though, that they test something, and then if people don't buy it, they then back off.
[00:18:51.413 --> 00:18:53.254]  It's part of a conditioning process.
[00:18:53.254 --> 00:19:00.659]  And sure, they're running hard kills in Africa, Asia, Latin America, where the polio vaccine this year has been killing people.
[00:19:00.659 --> 00:19:08.324]  It's weaponized, and it gives you full-blown, super hardcore, weaponized version of polio.
[00:19:08.324 --> 00:19:09.145]  Killed a bunch of people.
[00:19:11.644 --> 00:19:16.768]  So I don't blame her for thinking they were about to launch it, announcing North Com, military drills everywhere.
[00:19:16.768 --> 00:19:19.130]  They're certainly considering it.
[00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:29.018]  And I would look for some point in the future for them to really turn the heat up, and they may launch some big Blitzkrieg crises, but instead I see the incremental march.
[00:19:29.018 --> 00:19:35.644]  Because if you add all the incrementalism together, they can bring you into it slower and ensure you don't wake up and resist it.
[00:19:36.587 --> 00:19:40.729]  And so she's in there, you know, going, no, Jesse, I think it's going to happen right now.
[00:19:40.729 --> 00:19:44.610]  I think in the next few months, and who knows, you've still got a few months to be right.
[00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:49.112]  I just, uh... But I recommended her.
[00:19:49.112 --> 00:19:53.653]  I recommended, of course, well, basically everybody you see in the show.
[00:19:53.653 --> 00:19:57.215]  And I'm proud of it.
[00:19:57.215 --> 00:19:58.895]  It's just, the global warming is perfect.
[00:19:58.895 --> 00:19:59.876]  The global warming episode.

[00:21:03.843 --> 00:21:04.164]  Yeah.
[00:21:04.164 --> 00:21:09.206]  Don't you know Google, Yahoo, and other search engines record all your searches and store them in a giant database?
[00:21:09.206 --> 00:21:10.847]  You should use Startpage instead.
[00:21:10.847 --> 00:21:11.587]  Startpage?
[00:21:11.587 --> 00:21:12.007]  Yeah.
[00:21:12.007 --> 00:21:13.088]  Startpage.com.
[00:21:13.088 --> 00:21:16.049]  The new name for Ixquik, the world's most private search engine.

[00:21:27.275 --> 00:21:27.575]  Right!

[00:21:32.818 --> 00:21:36.680]  There are some habits you need to break if you want to hold on to your privacy.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.463]  That's why I'm inviting you to take the one-week StartPage challenge.

[00:22:00.606 --> 00:22:07.290]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:15.415]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:15.415 --> 00:22:23.579]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:23.579 --> 00:22:28.322]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.662 --> 00:22:33.887]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.887 --> 00:22:38.232]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:38.232 --> 00:22:39.333]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:39.333 --> 00:22:43.817]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:51.245]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[00:22:55.607 --> 00:23:01.409]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.409 --> 00:23:04.310]  Our economy is in great distress.
[00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:07.852]  The financial dominoes can fall at any time.
[00:23:07.852 --> 00:23:13.374]  It's time to stop hoping it doesn't happen and prepare just in case it does.
[00:23:13.374 --> 00:23:16.035]  You have auto and home insurance.
[00:23:16.035 --> 00:23:18.076]  Why wouldn't you have food insurance?
[00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:22.532]  Are you prepared to feed your family long-term?
[00:23:22.532 --> 00:23:25.173]  Because it might take years to recover.
[00:23:25.173 --> 00:23:31.716]  As the adult, it's your responsibility to feed your family, especially during rough times.
[00:23:31.716 --> 00:23:39.059]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is offering a package that will give you a 3-acre heirloom vegetable garden anywhere.
[00:23:39.059 --> 00:23:46.202]  50 heirloom varieties, 8,000 vegetable seeds, over 5 pounds of healthy food.
[00:23:47.159 --> 00:23:51.623]  Don't be fooled by marketing companies disguised as patriots.
[00:23:51.623 --> 00:23:57.448]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is owned by Big John Lipscomb, host of Don't Tread on Me radio show.
[00:24:33.086 --> 00:24:55.140]  We are back live ladies and gentlemen it is the last live transmission 2009 and if you think I'm gonna sit around in 2010 and let the New World Order and a bunch of criminal murdering control freaks run all over me and my family you got another thing coming
[00:24:56.346 --> 00:25:02.547]  I pledge that 2010 will be a new level in our fight against tyranny.
[00:25:02.547 --> 00:25:12.709]  A new level in what the Info Wars operation and our attack frigate does in the fight out there hunting and killing New World Order lives.
[00:25:12.709 --> 00:25:19.910]  I promise that in this year we are going to absolutely wreak havoc against the enemy forces.
[00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.151]  What do you pledge in 2010?
[00:25:26.653 --> 00:25:29.895]  Sunday and next week we're going to be talking more on air.
[00:25:29.895 --> 00:25:32.297]  I'll be live Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:25:32.297 --> 00:25:38.782]  about what you pledge to do in your own operations with targets of opportunity.
[00:25:38.782 --> 00:25:42.324]  You're only alive one time.
[00:25:42.324 --> 00:25:49.869]  It's time to choose your destiny and to choose the spirit of 1776.
[00:25:49.869 --> 00:25:55.854]  It's time to feel the fury of liberty rising in your guts.
[00:25:56.906 --> 00:26:10.739]  Pouring into your bones, animating your heart, your mind, and joining our fathers in freedom.
[00:26:10.739 --> 00:26:13.141]  It is your destiny.
[00:26:13.141 --> 00:26:22.950]  And before I go to sleep with my fathers, before I go into the tomb, before I pass from this world, I've got more things to do.
[00:26:25.069 --> 00:26:27.851]  And thank God I learned about the choices in the world.
[00:26:27.851 --> 00:26:34.834]  Thank God I learned that I don't just have to serve the system and go along with these greedy murderous New World Order trash.
[00:26:34.834 --> 00:26:43.139]  Thank God I learned the power of the dynamic human spirit created in the image of God.
[00:26:43.139 --> 00:26:46.140]  The New World Order knows that and that's why they play God.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.222]  A devilish God who wants to take free will from man.
[00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:54.131]  Everything the New World Order does is about taking free will.
[00:26:54.131 --> 00:26:58.693]  Everything they do is about lying and poisoning you.
[00:26:58.693 --> 00:27:01.435]  But the creator of the universe wants you to be free.
[00:27:01.435 --> 00:27:02.755]  Wants you to have free will.
[00:27:02.755 --> 00:27:04.096]  Wants you to know the truth.
[00:27:04.096 --> 00:27:06.117]  They knew the truth and it set them free!
[00:27:07.423 --> 00:27:10.826]  The people perish for lack of knowledge!
[00:27:10.826 --> 00:27:15.871]  And all I'm here to do is to tell you, you don't have to even believe the knowledge I put out.
[00:27:15.871 --> 00:27:21.597]  You don't even have to believe my particular view, my perspective, my opinion on the world.
[00:27:21.597 --> 00:27:29.084]  All you need to know is that there's a lot of mysteries in the planet, a lot of mysteries in the universe, a lot of mysteries in the human heart and soul and mind and psyche.
[00:27:31.488 --> 00:27:41.651]  And that much of the world is being kept from you, that the establishment wants to keep you stunted and small and fearful.
[00:27:41.651 --> 00:27:51.113]  All I want you to do is to wake up and to look around you and to begin to investigate and to begin to question for yourself.
[00:27:51.113 --> 00:27:53.073]  Who could be against that?
[00:27:53.073 --> 00:27:54.654]  Who could disagree with that?
[00:27:55.717 --> 00:28:22.794]  Who could disagree with standing for the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, versus the global governance offer of total tyranny and neo-feudalistic serfdom, bondage, having your resources incrementally cut off, having your future avenues destroyed, having men and women turned against each other, having our elders treated like garbage to be thrown away?
[00:28:23.993 --> 00:28:35.558]  Having unwanted babies torn from their mother's wombs, that greatest place of safety and used for medical experiments!
[00:28:35.558 --> 00:28:38.899]  The truth is written on your soul.
[00:28:38.899 --> 00:28:43.041]  Your code of conduct is written on your heart and your mind.
[00:28:43.041 --> 00:28:45.061]  You know right and wrong.
[00:28:45.061 --> 00:28:47.482]  A child knows right and wrong.
[00:28:47.482 --> 00:28:51.224]  Whether they be a poor, starving African in Somalia,
[00:28:52.845 --> 00:29:00.151]  Or some rich, middle-class banker's son in the Netherlands.
[00:29:00.151 --> 00:29:03.414]  You have the truth written on your heart.
[00:29:03.414 --> 00:29:05.435]  You know right from wrong.
[00:29:05.435 --> 00:29:15.163]  And so the system uses excuses and tells you you don't have power, and tells you you're not a leader, and whispers in your ear and tells you you're bad and you're evil.
[00:29:15.163 --> 00:29:18.065]  So you aren't allowed to stand up and speak out.
[00:29:18.065 --> 00:29:20.007]  You need to sit down and let the experts do it.
[00:29:21.553 --> 00:29:22.833]  And don't listen to that leader.
[00:29:22.833 --> 00:29:24.013]  Don't listen to that group.
[00:29:24.013 --> 00:29:26.474]  Don't get involved with this organization.
[00:29:26.474 --> 00:29:29.014]  Just sit there ninnying.
[00:29:29.014 --> 00:29:30.575]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:30.575 --> 00:29:33.055]  You know that you are good.
[00:29:33.055 --> 00:29:36.296]  You know that you have the light of God in your eyes.
[00:29:36.296 --> 00:29:38.636]  You know that you want justice.
[00:29:38.636 --> 00:29:49.718]  And so now I ask you on the eve of 2010 to take up your destiny in your hands to get on the battlefield and stand against evil!
[00:29:51.215 --> 00:29:55.138]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.138 --> 00:30:00.422]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.422 --> 00:30:04.986]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:30:04.986 --> 00:30:09.309]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:30:09.309 --> 00:30:15.074]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:30:15.074 --> 00:30:20.378]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:30:20.678 --> 00:30:21.499]  Number 3.
[00:30:21.499 --> 00:30:25.082]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:30:25.082 --> 00:30:29.005]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:30:29.005 --> 00:30:29.785]  Number 4.
[00:30:29.785 --> 00:30:32.547]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:30:32.547 --> 00:30:36.230]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:37.031]  Number 5.
[00:30:37.031 --> 00:30:41.174]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:30:41.174 --> 00:30:45.938]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:30:46.218 --> 00:30:50.383]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:31:00.868 --> 00:31:03.870]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:31:03.870 --> 00:31:09.193]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:31:09.193 --> 00:31:11.254]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:31:11.254 --> 00:31:16.257]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:31:16.257 --> 00:31:17.158]  How much do you want?
[00:31:17.418 --> 00:31:18.539]  When do you want it?
[00:31:18.539 --> 00:31:20.441]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:31:20.441 --> 00:31:21.502]  When will you need it?
[00:31:21.502 --> 00:31:23.704]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:31:23.704 --> 00:31:25.045]  Will there be any food?
[00:31:25.045 --> 00:31:26.586]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:31:26.586 --> 00:31:31.851]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:31:31.851 --> 00:31:35.435]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:38.898]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:31:39.238 --> 00:31:40.479]  How much will you need?
[00:31:40.479 --> 00:31:41.359]  We don't know.
[00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:42.480]  How much do you want?
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.400]  All you can get.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:44.501]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:31:44.501 --> 00:31:47.542]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:31:47.542 --> 00:31:49.323]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:31:49.323 --> 00:31:50.243]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:31:59.847 --> 00:32:05.154]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[00:32:05.154 --> 00:32:09.700]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.963]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[00:32:11.963 --> 00:32:13.585]  You don't have to cooperate.
[00:32:13.585 --> 00:32:14.627]  There is a solution.
[00:32:14.847 --> 00:32:23.276]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[00:32:23.276 --> 00:32:30.744]  Try their Interfood with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the energy you need and will keep you well.
[00:32:30.744 --> 00:32:36.390]  It even won the award for Best Superfood of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health ranger.
[00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:42.794]  I love their NutriCafe, great organic coffee infused with herbal extracts to boost your immune system.
[00:32:42.794 --> 00:32:46.937]  Try all of their truly honest products that will keep you alive and healthy.
[00:32:46.937 --> 00:32:54.403]  Go to enerfood.com or give them a call right now, 866-762-9238.
[00:32:54.403 --> 00:32:58.906]  Click on their banner at infowars.com to see all the available discounts.
[00:32:58.906 --> 00:33:04.310]  And Obama and Hillary Clinton did attend the Bilderberg meeting in Virginia in 2008.
[00:33:06.505 --> 00:33:18.593]  Daniel, if the Bilderbergs are successful and they create this one world government type scenario, how does that affect John Q. Public, the everyday citizen?
[00:33:18.593 --> 00:33:25.037]  When you have all these regions merging into one, you're going to have a world constitution, which is going to take precedence over the American constitution.
[00:33:25.037 --> 00:33:30.721]  So Daniel, the Bilderbergs are out to destroy the sovereignty of the United States of America.
[00:33:30.721 --> 00:33:32.623]  We're like the last bastion left.
[00:33:32.623 --> 00:33:34.744]  It's the last beacon of hope we have.
[00:33:34.744 --> 00:33:35.745]  Taking our freedoms,
[00:33:36.625 --> 00:33:38.786]  I thought that was bad enough.
[00:33:38.786 --> 00:33:41.288]  But Estalin said it doesn't end there.
[00:33:41.288 --> 00:33:44.109]  We Americans aren't only too independent.
[00:33:44.109 --> 00:33:47.091]  The Bilderbergs think there's too many of us to control.
[00:33:47.091 --> 00:33:50.793]  So they want to start eliminating people.
[00:33:50.793 --> 00:33:52.894]  People like you and me.
[00:33:54.204 --> 00:33:57.627]  Needless to say, the people who control the world, they don't need 7 billion people.
[00:33:57.627 --> 00:34:02.130]  They just need enough people to work the fields as they did 700 years ago.
[00:34:02.130 --> 00:34:10.276]  So in a society like the American society, if you actually have growth, if you actually have progress, you're creating something for future generations.
[00:34:10.276 --> 00:34:12.637]  Which is what the Bilderbergs are trying to destroy.
[00:34:12.637 --> 00:34:14.318]  Exactly.
[00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:17.421]  Estulent gives Jesse Ventura more than enough to investigate.
[00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:20.251]  But he also leaves him with a warning.
[00:34:20.251 --> 00:34:25.338]  Back in 1996, they tried to kill me when we exposed their plans to destroy Canada.
[00:34:25.338 --> 00:34:27.540]  Wait, they tried to kill you?
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:29.743]  Someone attempted to murder you?
[00:34:29.743 --> 00:34:30.464]  Absolutely.
[00:34:30.464 --> 00:34:34.749]  Obviously, I have to be very, very careful what I do and how I do things and there's always concern for the family.
[00:34:36.769 --> 00:34:42.810]  By the time the governor returns to home base, his conspiracy team has already begun checking the facts.
[00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.210]  Okay, people, what do we got?
[00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.671]  Well, there's one thing for sure.
[00:34:45.671 --> 00:34:48.191]  This Bilderberg group definitely exists.
[00:34:48.191 --> 00:34:49.571]  And it's totally out in the open.
[00:34:49.571 --> 00:34:50.811]  The meetings aren't any secret.
[00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:53.972]  No, but what goes on in the meetings is secret.
[00:34:53.972 --> 00:34:55.752]  And some big names attend.
[00:34:55.752 --> 00:34:58.993]  We have some surveillance photos from some past Bilderberg meetings.
[00:34:58.993 --> 00:35:05.894]  Guys like David Rockefeller, Tim Geithner... Geithner, isn't he the current Treasury Secretary?
[00:35:07.006 --> 00:35:07.749]  Isn't he Clinton's lawyer?
[00:35:07.749 --> 00:35:07.829]  Yeah!
[00:35:15.484 --> 00:35:17.085]  And a Paul Wolfowitz.
[00:35:17.085 --> 00:35:18.486]  And that's really just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:35:18.486 --> 00:35:21.868]  There's a bunch of other big names that have been to meetings like this.
[00:35:21.868 --> 00:35:26.771]  Tom Daschle, Hank Paulson, Condoleezza Rice, Prince Charles.
[00:35:26.771 --> 00:35:35.016]  My question is, how do you get this many powerful people in the same room at the same time, without there being some sort of hierarchy, some sort of leadership that's running these meetings?
[00:35:35.016 --> 00:35:35.877]  You're right.
[00:35:35.877 --> 00:35:39.339]  You're hitting the nail on the head, and they're all from different walks of life.
[00:35:39.339 --> 00:35:39.800]  Media,
[00:35:40.780 --> 00:35:41.501]  Politics.
[00:35:41.501 --> 00:35:42.001]  Business.
[00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:43.081]  Business.
[00:35:43.081 --> 00:35:43.442]  Banking.
[00:35:43.442 --> 00:35:44.542]  Banking.
[00:35:44.542 --> 00:35:45.623]  Probably oil.
[00:35:45.623 --> 00:35:47.244]  Who knows where they're all from.
[00:35:47.244 --> 00:35:51.346]  And they're all leaders of their own, for lack of better term, kingdoms.
[00:35:51.346 --> 00:35:51.827]  Yeah.
[00:35:51.827 --> 00:35:53.828]  And now they're all getting together.
[00:35:53.828 --> 00:35:55.349]  And they keep coming back.
[00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:56.409]  I think it's obvious.
[00:35:56.409 --> 00:36:04.534]  We gotta go out and learn what we can about the Bilderbergs.
[00:36:04.534 --> 00:36:06.715]  Coming up.
[00:36:06.715 --> 00:36:08.176]  A life and death car chase.
[00:36:11.417 --> 00:36:24.427]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, Webster Tarpley, with a year in review, decade in review, looking forward to the next year, will be joining us coming up in an hour and a half from now.
[00:36:24.427 --> 00:36:36.636]  In the last hour today, I'm going to play select clips from the Secret Society's World Murder Plot, World Death Plot episode.
[00:36:38.376 --> 00:36:39.297]  That aired last night.
[00:36:39.297 --> 00:36:42.399]  I'm going to analyze it and break it down.
[00:36:42.399 --> 00:36:43.239]  Unprecedented.
[00:36:43.239 --> 00:36:51.485]  Bilderberg, their plan to set up world government, to depopulate, how the interlocking structure works.
[00:36:51.485 --> 00:36:52.466]  Unprecedented.
[00:36:52.466 --> 00:36:56.809]  Incredible courage by the producers, by Jesse Ventura, the producer and owner of the show.
[00:36:56.809 --> 00:37:01.972]  I'm very honored to be a consultant on this.
[00:37:01.972 --> 00:37:07.476]  Just an incredible breakthrough watershed event.
[00:37:08.868 --> 00:37:11.970]  For this to get on air.
[00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:14.272]  It's unprecedented.
[00:37:14.272 --> 00:37:16.473]  All the shows are so good, I have to pick a favorite though.
[00:37:16.473 --> 00:37:26.080]  I have to say the Global Worming Fraud one is just so focused, so well documented, so conclusive.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.803]  The Big Brother one will wake up masses of people.
[00:37:29.803 --> 00:37:30.924]  This was a great episode.
[00:37:35.313 --> 00:37:39.561]  I just think this episode is going to be so shocking for people so on our side.
[00:37:40.612 --> 00:37:47.155]  So totally one-sided to our view, that I actually think people will watch it and won't believe it.
[00:37:47.155 --> 00:37:47.915]  At least some people.
[00:37:47.915 --> 00:37:49.316]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:37:49.316 --> 00:37:53.338]  Down the road, they'll begin to see the evidence of it in their own lives.
[00:37:53.338 --> 00:37:58.020]  See, once you know the World Population Reduction Program, then you start seeing the evidence of it all around you.
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:02.542]  And suddenly you see magazines on the rack calling for forcibly reducing population.
[00:38:02.542 --> 00:38:04.823]  You see articles calling for one-child policies.
[00:38:04.823 --> 00:38:08.365]  You see articles about drugs in the water, about fertility dropping.
[00:38:09.554 --> 00:38:12.596]  So overall, I don't know how they got this on air.
[00:38:12.596 --> 00:38:16.398]  I'm just stunned.
[00:38:16.398 --> 00:38:24.644]  We're also going to open the phones up in this hour and the next hour and just go over masses of new news that came out today and tons of news I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:38:24.644 --> 00:38:29.187]  I'm going to try to just throw out a smattering of news here and there without getting too deep into it.
[00:38:29.187 --> 00:38:32.609]  We'll never have time to go to your calls or get to the other news.
[00:38:32.609 --> 00:38:34.210]  It is the last day of 2009.
[00:38:34.210 --> 00:38:34.770]  It's a blue moon.
[00:38:40.373 --> 00:38:47.861]  Meaning a full moon that comes out of the regular lunar cycle.
[00:38:47.861 --> 00:38:49.643]  What, two full moons in a row?
[00:38:49.643 --> 00:38:51.665]  Full moon last night and tonight?
[00:38:51.665 --> 00:38:59.033]  And it's falling on the last day of 2009.
[00:38:59.033 --> 00:39:00.294]  A super blue moon!
[00:39:00.294 --> 00:39:01.876]  That's incredibly rare.
[00:39:08.183 --> 00:39:09.083]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:39:09.083 --> 00:39:09.883]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:39:09.883 --> 00:39:26.047]  And we will get you up and on the air.
[00:39:26.047 --> 00:39:32.188]  I mean, here's just some of the news I have in my stack in front of me today.
[00:39:32.188 --> 00:39:35.769]  World Health Organization chief yet to be vaccinated against swine flu.
[00:39:37.253 --> 00:39:45.355]  And it turned out the entire German government and other European governments will not take it and are given an additive-free shot.
[00:39:45.355 --> 00:39:47.696]  And that's probably just salt solution.
[00:39:47.696 --> 00:39:49.016]  They do on television.
[00:39:49.016 --> 00:39:54.997]  They said, oh, this is something special we're getting.
[00:39:54.997 --> 00:39:56.558]  Second full moon in a month.
[00:39:56.558 --> 00:40:04.259]  The term blue moon generally refers to the second full moon in a month and occurs just once every 2.7 years.
[00:40:04.259 --> 00:40:06.440]  The last, and it goes on.
[00:40:07.912 --> 00:40:15.540]  Here I'm talking about world leaders not taking shots and they throw up on screen the definition of blue moon and I start reading it.
[00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:16.081]  It's alright.
[00:40:16.081 --> 00:40:20.005]  Hey, I love factoids too.
[00:40:20.005 --> 00:40:22.287]  In a way it's almost like a teleprompter though.
[00:40:22.287 --> 00:40:26.452]  Because I have these big TV screens in here and while you guys are surfing the internet looking for documents and things,
[00:40:27.898 --> 00:40:30.819]  I'll be looking at it and start reading what's on it.
[00:40:30.819 --> 00:40:35.100]  World Health Organization chief yet to be vaccinated against swine flu.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:38.281]  You got all these other world leaders refusing to take it.
[00:40:38.281 --> 00:40:44.382]  But you need to take it!
[00:40:44.382 --> 00:40:53.284]  World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan revealed Tuesday that she had yet to be vaccinated against the swine flu virus, which has killed over 11,500 worldwide.
[00:40:58.141 --> 00:41:05.744]  And a regular flu, by the way, kills around 300,000 a year, or more than halfway through the flu season.
[00:41:05.744 --> 00:41:08.865]  So the regular flu kills 300 plus thousand.
[00:41:08.865 --> 00:41:10.646]  Let's say we're halfway through, so it'll be 22, 23,000.
[00:41:10.646 --> 00:41:11.446]  Let's say it kills another 11,500.
[00:41:11.446 --> 00:41:11.706]  So that's 23,000.
[00:41:24.278 --> 00:41:27.701]  What's 23,000 divided into 300,000?
[00:41:27.701 --> 00:41:29.122]  Let's be conservative.
[00:41:29.122 --> 00:41:29.762]  Kills more than 300,000 a year.
[00:41:29.762 --> 00:41:30.623]  Let's just say 23,000 divided into 300,000.
[00:41:38.797 --> 00:41:47.244]  So, the regular seasonal flu kills 13 times... That's a good factoid blurb.
[00:41:47.244 --> 00:41:49.446]  You ought to send that over to Watson or Curt Nemo to blurb.
[00:41:49.446 --> 00:41:51.448]  So people get an idea.
[00:41:51.448 --> 00:41:54.110]  The regular flu kills 13 times...
[00:42:01.061 --> 00:42:09.569]  What this flu causes, but we're told it's the deadliest pandemic since 1918, and you've all got to take the shot.
[00:42:09.569 --> 00:42:16.074]  Kind of like in 1976, the swine flu at military bases killed a few people that had just been inoculated.
[00:42:16.074 --> 00:42:22.160]  And so they fear-mongered and thousands got sick and hundreds and hundreds, and that's conservative, died.
[00:42:22.160 --> 00:42:25.162]  More like tens of thousands died, hundreds of thousands got sick.
[00:42:25.162 --> 00:42:26.964]  But let's just go with the official whitewash numbers.
[00:42:30.033 --> 00:42:33.414]  The 1918 broke out after inoculations.
[00:42:33.414 --> 00:42:36.795]  Remember how they gave the live swine flu three months ago?
[00:42:36.795 --> 00:42:49.117]  The first shots they put out, which they admit incubated in the nostrils, in the sinus, and then it spreads?
[00:42:49.117 --> 00:42:51.178]  And then, yeah, you did see more flu after that.
[00:42:51.178 --> 00:42:51.998]  And it did mutate.
[00:42:54.107 --> 00:42:59.668]  And then there have been people dying from the shots, having convulsions, becoming sterilized, getting Guillain-Barré.
[00:42:59.668 --> 00:43:04.929]  I know several people in Austin who took last year's seasonal and got Guillain-Barré.
[00:43:04.929 --> 00:43:06.910]  Diagnosed by the doctor!
[00:43:06.910 --> 00:43:10.091]  Oh, this is quite rare, but quite normal.
[00:43:10.091 --> 00:43:10.651]  No big deal.
[00:43:10.651 --> 00:43:13.471]  Yes, you now have numb feet and numb hands.
[00:43:13.471 --> 00:43:14.752]  You're lucky you didn't get it worse.
[00:43:14.752 --> 00:43:15.892]  You're lucky you can even walk.
[00:43:17.329 --> 00:43:26.311]  I still recommend you take the shot, though, because the end justifies the means, and statistically, you know, it helps so many people, and such a small number get it.
[00:43:26.311 --> 00:43:27.492]  Should I just read headlines?
[00:43:27.492 --> 00:43:29.252]  But how do you do that?
[00:43:29.252 --> 00:43:33.833]  World Health Organization chief yet to be vaccinated against swine flu.
[00:43:33.833 --> 00:43:41.675]  World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan revealed that she is yet to be vaccinated against the swine flu.
[00:43:41.675 --> 00:43:45.556]  This is from French news agency.
[00:43:46.701 --> 00:43:47.961]  This is from Press TV.
[00:43:47.961 --> 00:43:48.402]  U.S.
[00:43:48.402 --> 00:43:53.663]  Yemen gear up for fight for flight 253 retaliatory strike.
[00:43:53.663 --> 00:43:54.764]  That's right.
[00:43:54.764 --> 00:43:55.204]  U.S.
[00:43:55.204 --> 00:43:58.305]  Special Forces have been massing for a year there, 2,000 of them.
[00:43:58.305 --> 00:44:04.007]  They started hyping last week before the Christmas Day underwear bombing.
[00:44:04.007 --> 00:44:08.148]  And so now they're gearing up for the retaliatory strike.
[00:44:08.148 --> 00:44:10.849]  All because of the underwear bombing.
[00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:11.469]  Washington.
[00:44:15.276 --> 00:44:20.319]  And the capital of Yemen are reviewing targets for possible territory strike on Yemen's soil.
[00:44:20.319 --> 00:44:22.020]  That'll get his approval rating up.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:27.383]  Power of Pride guys, people that stick those bumper stickers on their cars, they'll suddenly be going, I like Obama.
[00:44:27.383 --> 00:44:30.345]  I don't care if he robbed us with the banks or government health care.
[00:44:30.345 --> 00:44:31.085]  Kind of like him.
[00:44:31.085 --> 00:44:32.686]  He's kind of getting tough.
[00:44:32.686 --> 00:44:34.047]  I want to be body scanned.
[00:44:34.047 --> 00:44:35.948]  Prove I'm conservative.
[00:44:35.948 --> 00:44:37.089]  I like SWAT team.
[00:44:37.089 --> 00:44:40.310]  Yeah, boy.
[00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:40.931]  Washington
[00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:53.910]  And Yemen are reviewing targets for possible territory strike on Yemen's soil in the wake of the failed Christmas Day attack on the Detroit-bound airliner, which al-Qaeda in Yemen claims have organized.
[00:44:53.910 --> 00:45:00.336]  Yes, a government-run message board said so.
[00:45:00.336 --> 00:45:01.778]  And the media is trying to pick this up.
[00:45:01.778 --> 00:45:06.782]  Remember four years ago, somebody did a fake beheading in their San Francisco garage?
[00:45:08.194 --> 00:45:11.296]  I watched the video and said, that's gotta be fake, that looks fake.
[00:45:11.296 --> 00:45:15.639]  And then it came out a few days later, oh, that was fake!
[00:45:15.639 --> 00:45:21.983]  Then the guy that did it sent me an email saying, yeah, I'm a listener, Alex, I just did it as a joke to show how stupid this is.
[00:45:21.983 --> 00:45:26.005]  But I better not come on because the FBI is threatening me.
[00:45:26.005 --> 00:45:31.949]  By the way, dig that guy's name out, I forget, maybe he'll come on now, in hindsight.
[00:45:31.949 --> 00:45:32.850]  You guys read me in there?
[00:45:32.850 --> 00:45:34.751]  You guys read me in there?
[00:45:36.434 --> 00:45:38.376]  Write a note to ask me during the break.
[00:45:38.376 --> 00:45:43.281]  I want to get the guy on who did the fake beheading four or five years ago in San Francisco.
[00:45:43.281 --> 00:45:45.964]  He said he'd come on later, but the FBI was on his tail then.
[00:45:45.964 --> 00:45:48.146]  He did it just to prove how they pick up fake media.
[00:45:48.146 --> 00:45:48.847]  He'll probably come on now.
[00:45:48.847 --> 00:45:50.328]  That'd be an interesting interview to do in hindsight.
[00:45:50.328 --> 00:45:51.229]  He wouldn't come on then.
[00:45:51.229 --> 00:45:51.890]  I bet he'll come on now.
[00:45:53.632 --> 00:45:54.312]  I forget his name.
[00:45:54.312 --> 00:45:57.094]  Just Google fake beheading video.
[00:45:57.094 --> 00:45:58.895]  San Francisco and you'll get it.
[00:45:58.895 --> 00:45:59.296]  U.S.
[00:45:59.296 --> 00:46:03.558]  Yemen gear up for flight 253 retaliatory strike.
[00:46:03.558 --> 00:46:06.780]  And they just say, oh, you know, the media just picks it up as if it's true.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.702]  Oh, Al Qaeda did it because the message board said so.
[00:46:09.702 --> 00:46:12.904]  The grandson of the ADL head, former ADL head Adam Gadon says so.
[00:46:12.904 --> 00:46:13.485]  Oh, it must be true.
[00:46:14.145 --> 00:46:18.468]  Oh yeah, they uploaded the video on the same video layer as the Al-Qaeda logo.
[00:46:18.468 --> 00:46:20.069]  The Intel Center has the same logo.
[00:46:20.069 --> 00:46:21.890]  Oh, same video layer.
[00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:23.831]  Oh, you mean they uploaded the video?
[00:46:23.831 --> 00:46:25.352]  Yeah, but so what?
[00:46:25.352 --> 00:46:25.872]  They're friendly.
[00:46:25.872 --> 00:46:26.393]  They care about us.
[00:46:26.393 --> 00:46:28.894]  They want to fight Al-Qaeda.
[00:46:28.894 --> 00:46:29.975]  Two senior U.S.
[00:46:29.975 --> 00:46:41.062]  officials speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN on Tuesday that the effort is aimed at devising options for the White House in case President Barack Obama orders a retaliatory strike.
[00:46:42.014 --> 00:46:43.275]  Yeah, I'm feeling pretty good.
[00:46:43.275 --> 00:46:47.156]  The banks robbed me, but at least we bombed some Arabs.
[00:46:47.156 --> 00:46:51.618]  They'll bomb some innocent people, but they can't actually bomb the real Al-Qaeda operatives.
[00:46:51.618 --> 00:46:53.839]  But it'll make American men feel tough.
[00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:57.540]  They'll strut around and bow down to some police and things and feel powerful.
[00:46:57.540 --> 00:46:58.481]  Two senior U.S.
[00:46:58.481 --> 00:47:05.544]  officials speaking on condition of anonymity told CNN on Tuesday that the effort is aimed at devising options for the White House to target Al-Qaeda.
[00:47:06.189 --> 00:47:11.873]  The official added, the effort is to see whether targets can be specifically linked to the airliner incident and its planning.
[00:47:11.873 --> 00:47:13.994]  Ah, yes.
[00:47:13.994 --> 00:47:21.979]  And of course, the underwear bomber, all his intelligence connections, he was ushered onto the plane and protected and everything else.
[00:47:21.979 --> 00:47:28.284]  He's now saying he did it with Al Qaeda and he's proud of 9-11.
[00:47:28.284 --> 00:47:28.604]  See?
[00:47:28.604 --> 00:47:28.864]  See?
[00:47:28.864 --> 00:47:29.845]  Al Qaeda says they did 9-11.
[00:47:29.845 --> 00:47:29.985]  See?
[00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:30.225]  See?
[00:47:30.225 --> 00:47:31.466]  Intel Center says so.
[00:47:34.406 --> 00:47:36.687]  Adam Gadon of the ADL says so.
[00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:43.291]  Official claims second man unrelated to Christmas attack.
[00:47:43.291 --> 00:47:47.393]  See, first they said they didn't detain a second man.
[00:47:47.393 --> 00:47:50.395]  This headline should be caught in lie, this Prison Planet headline.
[00:47:50.395 --> 00:47:51.656]  FBI caught lying, but...
[00:47:52.628 --> 00:47:56.329]  Says it says, official claims second man unrelated to Christmas attack.
[00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:57.910]  Bomber's accomplice being protected.
[00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:00.531]  Multiple eyewitness accounts contradicted.
[00:48:00.531 --> 00:48:04.712]  See, first they said, oh, we didn't detain a second guy in the Detroit Customs.
[00:48:04.712 --> 00:48:07.033]  We didn't say, everybody get out of here for your safety.
[00:48:07.033 --> 00:48:08.673]  There's a bomb.
[00:48:08.673 --> 00:48:10.234]  First they said, that person doesn't exist.
[00:48:10.234 --> 00:48:10.934]  That doesn't happen.
[00:48:10.934 --> 00:48:12.295]  That's a lie.
[00:48:12.295 --> 00:48:14.115]  Now they say, oh yeah, it was unrelated.
[00:48:14.115 --> 00:48:15.816]  It was a passport issue.
[00:48:15.816 --> 00:48:16.256]  Oh really?
[00:48:18.154 --> 00:48:21.635]  But we have eyewitnesses that said the dog alerted to the bag.
[00:48:21.635 --> 00:48:22.995]  He was taken behind closed doors.
[00:48:22.995 --> 00:48:26.176]  He was told there was a bomb.
[00:48:26.176 --> 00:48:27.616]  There's no John Doe No.
[00:48:27.616 --> 00:48:28.256]  2.
[00:48:28.256 --> 00:48:29.657]  Muhammad Atta wasn't trained at U.S.
[00:48:29.657 --> 00:48:30.777]  military bases.
[00:48:30.777 --> 00:48:31.177]  Oh, really?
[00:48:31.177 --> 00:48:33.738]  The dean of the Defense Language School says he was in his class?
[00:48:33.738 --> 00:48:35.238]  Well, let's not talk about that.
[00:48:35.238 --> 00:48:38.059]  Let's put a gag order on the head of the base.
[00:48:40.177 --> 00:48:52.342]  Authorities have attempted to downplay the significance of the men seen involved in the plot, including an Indian man that helped bomber Umar Farooq Abbulahullah... I'm being sarcastic there.
[00:48:53.632 --> 00:49:04.302]  Board the plane, another man witness filming the entire flight included the bombing attempt as well as an Indian man handcuffed by the FBI after sniffer dogs detected something suspicious in his luggage.
[00:49:04.302 --> 00:49:11.228]  Federal officials did not take a second person into custody at Detroit Metropolitan Airport shortly after the attempt.
[00:49:11.228 --> 00:49:18.174]  They had previously said, now they changed one word to, federal officials DID take a second person into custody.
[00:49:18.174 --> 00:49:19.015]  Oh, changing your story!
[00:49:21.121 --> 00:49:22.762]  They say it was no big deal.
[00:49:22.762 --> 00:49:23.663]  Oh, but look.
[00:49:23.663 --> 00:49:26.224]  Detroit terror attack.
[00:49:26.224 --> 00:49:29.707]  The underwear bomber defended 9-11.
[00:49:29.707 --> 00:49:36.091]  He defended the terror attacks on New York, saying they were justified by American military activity.
[00:49:36.091 --> 00:49:41.694]  So that has the double-edged propaganda use of, oh, well, see, now if you're against the war, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[00:49:41.694 --> 00:49:46.597]  That's how that psychology works.
[00:49:46.597 --> 00:49:50.220]  That's why they've had all these Justice Department lawyers and John Yoo and many others say,
[00:49:52.048 --> 00:49:58.852]  If you criticize the war you're aiding Al Qaeda, thus you should be arrested and put in detention centers.
[00:49:58.852 --> 00:50:00.232]  There's some good news, though.
[00:50:00.232 --> 00:50:11.258]  Court throws out Sarkozy's carbon tax on the French, saying that it is unevenly and unfairly implemented by bureaucrats against whoever they wish, and so it's thrown out.
[00:50:11.258 --> 00:50:12.779]  That's out of the Sydney Morning Herald.
[00:50:12.779 --> 00:50:14.019]  Good news there.
[00:50:14.019 --> 00:50:18.342]  The Economist magazine, when they're not telling you how great it is that suddenly
[00:50:19.321 --> 00:50:21.363]  Most people can't have children or are sterilized.
[00:50:21.363 --> 00:50:23.445]  That's their current issue.
[00:50:23.445 --> 00:50:28.749]  The Economist Online says 2010 could be the year that sparks unrest.
[00:50:28.749 --> 00:50:34.975]  Funny, three years ago that's what the British Ministry of Defense report said.
[00:50:34.975 --> 00:50:35.996]  That's what we've been telling you.
[00:50:35.996 --> 00:50:37.317]  We'll cover that later.
[00:50:40.856 --> 00:50:43.057]  It's all coming up today.
[00:50:43.057 --> 00:50:44.959]  Your phone calls and a lot more.
[00:50:44.959 --> 00:50:47.220]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 It is the last radio show of 2009.
[00:50:47.220 --> 00:50:47.720]  And coming up...
[00:51:00.956 --> 00:51:04.497]  Hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters?
[00:51:04.497 --> 00:51:06.778]  Thinking of calling a debt relief company?
[00:51:06.778 --> 00:51:07.658]  Don't!
[00:51:07.658 --> 00:51:11.100]  Greedy lawyers and debt companies charge thousands.
[00:51:11.100 --> 00:51:20.183]  Why pay when you can get their solution absolutely free with New York Times best-selling author Herb Kay's number one debt secret.
[00:51:20.183 --> 00:51:23.844]  The how-to on stopping the calls without paying the debt companies.
[00:51:24.244 --> 00:51:27.386]  Yes, free for a very limited time.
[00:51:27.386 --> 00:51:34.770]  Here's Herb K. Don't get ripped off by credit repair companies when I can give you the information you need to do it yourself for free.
[00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:35.951]  Herb K was right.
[00:51:35.951 --> 00:51:39.133]  His free information helped me stop the calls and settle my debt.
[00:51:39.133 --> 00:51:40.494]  What have you got to lose?
[00:51:40.494 --> 00:51:44.196]  Stop the calls now, get out of debt, and have more money.
[00:51:44.196 --> 00:51:48.139]  Get Herb K's number one debt secret absolutely free now.
[00:51:48.139 --> 00:51:48.499]  Call 888-352-7726.
[00:51:52.581 --> 00:51:53.002]  That's 888-352-7726.
[00:51:53.002 --> 00:51:53.062]  888-352-7726.
[00:51:53.062 --> 00:51:55.924]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:51:55.924 --> 00:51:58.486]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:51:58.486 --> 00:52:02.530]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[00:52:11.681 --> 00:52:14.363]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[00:52:14.363 --> 00:52:20.749]  I have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.749 --> 00:52:25.933]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[00:52:25.933 --> 00:52:35.921]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[00:52:36.041 --> 00:52:38.382]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:52:38.382 --> 00:52:39.963]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:39.963 --> 00:52:42.424]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.424 --> 00:52:44.546]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:44.546 --> 00:52:49.708]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:52:49.708 --> 00:52:54.711]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:54.711 --> 00:52:58.813]  Or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:01.482 --> 00:53:03.244]  This is an emergency alert.
[00:53:03.244 --> 00:53:05.666]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[00:53:05.666 --> 00:53:09.209]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[00:53:09.209 --> 00:53:13.994]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[00:53:13.994 --> 00:53:19.159]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[00:53:19.739 --> 00:53:24.244]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.
[00:53:24.244 --> 00:53:30.690]  Call this number to get my free special report about the flu and what to do to save lives, maybe even your own.
[00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:32.332]  I'm Dr. Leonard Horowitz.
[00:53:32.332 --> 00:53:38.818]  Order Zeolife, the world's most powerful broad-spectrum detoxifier, immune system guard, and vaccine cleanse.
[00:53:38.818 --> 00:53:40.460]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:41.120]  I think so.
[00:54:09.457 --> 00:54:14.808]  Now I said I was going to get to this yesterday, and I didn't.
[00:54:14.808 --> 00:54:15.610]  I will today.
[00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:20.079]  I want to read over this article from PrisonPlanet.com, The Decade of Tyranny.
[00:54:21.482 --> 00:54:30.205]  I'm going to take phone calls first and I'm going to get back into health care that they're set to try to pass out of conference committee between the House and Senate next week.
[00:54:30.205 --> 00:54:35.287]  That really is the big issue that the underwear bomber distraction is distracting from.
[00:54:35.287 --> 00:54:36.708]  But it's not just a distraction.
[00:54:36.708 --> 00:54:40.109]  It's to launch a new war in southern Saudi Arabia.
[00:54:40.109 --> 00:54:42.470]  That's really what Yemen is.
[00:54:42.470 --> 00:54:43.611]  A protectorate of it.
[00:54:43.611 --> 00:54:44.111]  A vassal.
[00:54:45.823 --> 00:54:50.604]  And to go into the Horn of Africa and to go into Somalia and Sudan.
[00:54:50.604 --> 00:54:54.586]  As we told you in the Obama deception, look for Obama to do that.
[00:54:54.586 --> 00:54:56.906]  Seven months later, what's happening?
[00:54:56.906 --> 00:54:58.647]  We know what they're doing.
[00:54:58.647 --> 00:55:00.147]  And notice the perfect hype.
[00:55:00.147 --> 00:55:02.128]  Oh, Al-Qaeda's now moved here.
[00:55:02.128 --> 00:55:06.269]  And then in five years, when they've taken over those areas, oh, Al-Qaeda's now moved here.
[00:55:06.269 --> 00:55:09.270]  And oh, Al-Qaeda now works with white Americans.
[00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:10.970]  White Al-Qaeda, you're now hearing that.
[00:55:10.970 --> 00:55:12.431]  Oh, your neighbor, where'd Bob go?
[00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:18.554]  The government took over his factory, and one of the Homeland Security guys also is now dating his wife.
[00:55:18.554 --> 00:55:19.395]  Well, where'd Bob go?
[00:55:19.395 --> 00:55:21.076]  Oh, he was with Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:21.076 --> 00:55:22.216]  See, you just move around.
[00:55:22.216 --> 00:55:30.601]  I mean, pretty soon SWAT team just pulls up in front of your house, throws an Al-Qaeda mannequin up in your yard, takes you to jail, and the neighbors say, oh look, it's an Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:30.601 --> 00:55:34.283]  I mean, I'm being sarcastic, that's satire, but that's literally what it is.
[00:55:34.283 --> 00:55:37.325]  Oh look, Al-Qaeda's now here.
[00:55:37.325 --> 00:55:39.466]  Oh, why is the government spying on me without warrants?
[00:55:39.466 --> 00:55:40.027]  Oh, Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:42.361 --> 00:55:42.721]  Oh, really?
[00:55:42.721 --> 00:55:45.882]  Why are the kids being brainwashed to write reports on their parents and schools?
[00:55:45.882 --> 00:55:46.882]  Oh, well, things changed after 9-11.
[00:55:46.882 --> 00:55:51.483]  Yeah, but these reports are on their energy consumption and do they smoke marijuana?
[00:55:51.483 --> 00:55:53.064]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:55:53.064 --> 00:55:57.285]  Hey, why is the government listening to everybody's cell phones without warrants in non-terror-related cases?
[00:55:57.285 --> 00:55:58.965]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:55:58.965 --> 00:56:01.206]  Why are there body scanners recording my naked body?
[00:56:01.206 --> 00:56:02.206]  Why am I being searched?
[00:56:02.206 --> 00:56:04.026]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:04.026 --> 00:56:10.908]  But wait, you've got the borders wide open and the TSA is caught everywhere in the news hiring illegal aliens and mainly Muslims at many airports.
[00:56:11.969 --> 00:56:14.251]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:14.251 --> 00:56:16.172]  But you said Muslims are evil and want to get us.
[00:56:16.172 --> 00:56:18.934]  Why is Homeland Security hiring them without background checks?
[00:56:18.934 --> 00:56:23.057]  Why did Homeland Security hire illegal aliens to build part of the fence they never finished?
[00:56:23.057 --> 00:56:24.578]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:24.578 --> 00:56:26.640]  Why did the bank steal tens of trillions of dollars?
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.341]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:28.341 --> 00:56:34.626]  Why are there army checkpoints here in Tennessee and California searching people for drunk driving?
[00:56:34.626 --> 00:56:37.628]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:37.628 --> 00:56:38.969]  Why do I not have any freedom?
[00:56:38.969 --> 00:56:39.730]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:44.812]  Why is America no longer the home of the free land of the brave?
[00:56:44.812 --> 00:56:46.313]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:46.313 --> 00:56:49.195]  Why are we invading all these countries and paying for it and going bankrupt?
[00:56:49.195 --> 00:56:52.037]  Al-Qaeda!
[00:56:52.037 --> 00:56:54.278]  Things changed after 9-11.
[00:56:54.278 --> 00:57:05.386]  Then it comes out that the last White House, as if we needed Governor Ridge to tell us this, his new best-selling book, that the White House ordered him to issue fake terror alerts.
[00:57:05.386 --> 00:57:06.586]  Well, of course they did!
[00:57:06.586 --> 00:57:10.229]  I mean, even when the head of Homeland Security tells you it's fake.
[00:57:12.367 --> 00:57:14.969]  Al Qaeda!
[00:57:14.969 --> 00:57:24.494]  And if you don't think that Obama's doing this right now, I got some oceanfront property in Arizona, and from my front porch you can see the sea.
[00:57:24.494 --> 00:57:31.298]  I will sell you oceanfront property in Central Arizona right now.
[00:57:31.298 --> 00:57:38.643]  I'll sell it to you in Northern Arizona, at the Grand Canyon.
[00:57:38.643 --> 00:57:40.884]  If you believe any of this, you're being swindled!
[00:57:42.312 --> 00:57:46.355]  I'm going to come back and go directly to your phone calls.
[00:57:46.355 --> 00:57:47.616]  It's the last day of 2009.
[00:57:47.616 --> 00:57:50.738]  It's a blue moon, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:50.738 --> 00:57:56.181]  And if you want to take advantage of the year-end special, the Christmas special, it doesn't have long left.
[00:57:56.181 --> 00:57:58.243]  They'll be taking it down in the next week or so.

[00:58:26.850 --> 00:58:31.433]  PrisonPlanet.tv and we've also got deals to get free Obama Joker t-shirts.
[00:58:31.433 --> 00:58:32.753]  Supplies are running out.

[00:59:53.702 --> 00:59:56.083]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:58.866]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.379 --> 01:00:10.200]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.780]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.361]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.361 --> 01:00:17.542]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.542 --> 01:00:21.603]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:40.211 --> 01:00:48.038]  Now into hour number two of my final radio transmission of 2009.
[01:00:48.038 --> 01:00:59.188]  I'm tempted to drag my staff back in here tonight so I can do a live broadcast into the new year, but don't worry, don't look horrified, I'm not gonna do that.
[01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:02.351]  You guys can go out and partake of the grape.
[01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:19.100]  By the way, in Texas, this legislature passed a law, the police would take blood without warrants the last five years under federal grants, and they'd get sued and would lose.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.002]  So the state legislature just said, hey, no more warrants.
[01:01:22.002 --> 01:01:26.845]  We'll take your blood without warrants.
[01:01:26.845 --> 01:01:28.366]  And it's a no-refusal weekend.
[01:01:28.366 --> 01:01:29.467]  Let me tell the police something.
[01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:34.409]  I don't drink very often to begin with.
[01:01:34.409 --> 01:01:39.611]  I'll go six, eight months without drinking and then drink a few beers here and there and then say I'm not drinking anymore.
[01:01:39.611 --> 01:01:42.112]  But I don't drink and drive.
[01:01:42.112 --> 01:01:51.136]  You pull me over and want me to blow and violate my Fifth Amendment when I've done nothing wrong into your breathalyzer.
[01:01:51.136 --> 01:01:52.416]  I'm not doing it.
[01:01:52.416 --> 01:01:54.037]  And you stick your needle in my arm.
[01:01:55.327 --> 01:02:03.411]  I don't care if you lie and somebody told you, cops, you're above the law and that you're immune from prosecution and immune from civil actions.
[01:02:03.411 --> 01:02:05.293]  You're not when you're outside the Constitution.
[01:02:05.293 --> 01:02:08.474]  You're not immune.
[01:02:08.474 --> 01:02:12.777]  I mean, if cops were immune, they could rape your wife, barbecue your kids.
[01:02:12.777 --> 01:02:14.137]  I mean, they are in third world countries.
[01:02:14.137 --> 01:02:16.098]  When cops are immune, you live in North Korea.
[01:02:16.098 --> 01:02:16.739]  You live in Mexico.
[01:02:18.658 --> 01:02:20.138]  Society collapses.
[01:02:20.138 --> 01:02:23.139]  The government's telling you they're immune above the law.
[01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:25.080]  You read the Declaration of Independence.
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:32.522]  But anybody sticks a needle in my arm, you may beat the rap, you're not going to beat the ride.
[01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:38.103]  And Chief Art Acevedo, the tyranny of good intentions.
[01:02:38.103 --> 01:02:41.224]  He really thinks it's good to be a federal minion.
[01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:43.365]  He sat in the studio repeatedly.
[01:02:43.365 --> 01:02:48.126]  He really thinks because drunk drivers kill people, he can violate the Fourth Amendment and the Fifth Amendment.
[01:02:52.728 --> 01:02:55.289]  The feds aren't good guys, Art.
[01:02:55.289 --> 01:02:58.651]  They want to test police chiefs and see if you'll be a federal minion.
[01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:18.962]  And they do these federal programs with federal smoking bans they get the states and cities to pass, and federal seat belt rules that sound reasonable, and then federal rules on toilets and light bulbs, and federal rules on checkpoints, and federal rules on blood draws, until you're totally federal creatures.
[01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.583]  And the federal rules themselves were written internationally.
[01:03:24.178 --> 01:03:34.221]  And all over the country, your cities that have been federalized, have police out at RVs because they couldn't get doctors and nurses to do it.
[01:03:34.221 --> 01:03:40.382]  They know sticking needles in people without warrants is a violation of the Constitution.
[01:03:40.382 --> 01:03:46.484]  They couldn't get doctors to do it and nurses in Austin, so they have you, the cops.
[01:03:46.484 --> 01:03:51.545]  And I don't think cops are as dumb as they think you are, but every time I mention this, people don't believe it, but if you Google it, you can find it.
[01:03:52.509 --> 01:03:53.930]  All over the country.
[01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.912]  Another federal edict.
[01:03:56.912 --> 01:04:02.955]  Police departments will not hire officers for at least the last 15 years with over 100 IQ.
[01:04:02.955 --> 01:04:10.279]  So you better act stupid if you want to be a police officer and you have got above average IQ.
[01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:16.063]  And I heard the UN a month ago, they announced they're going to lower the global IQ score to 95 being average.
[01:04:16.063 --> 01:04:19.004]  See, people are so brain damaged.
[01:04:19.004 --> 01:04:19.825]  That's not education.
[01:04:19.825 --> 01:04:21.546]  That's basic intelligence.
[01:04:24.997 --> 01:04:26.618]  People are becoming retarded, folks.
[01:04:26.618 --> 01:04:27.939]  They're poisoning everyone.
[01:04:27.939 --> 01:04:29.840]  Pretty soon, someone with an A.D.I.Q.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.101]  will be genius.
[01:04:31.101 --> 01:04:34.763]  Someone who knows how to talk will be known as a god creature.
[01:04:34.763 --> 01:04:43.069]  Knowing how to tie your shoelaces will be an act of Pulitzer Prize winning acumen.
[01:04:43.069 --> 01:04:44.790]  I'm not joking.
[01:04:44.790 --> 01:04:52.055]  It will be known as a conspiracy theory in two or three generations that women ever gave milk to their babies from their mammary glands.
[01:04:53.021 --> 01:04:57.983]  That's how... that families once lived together.
[01:04:57.983 --> 01:04:59.923]  Everyone will live in dormitories with shaved heads.
[01:04:59.923 --> 01:05:00.624]  THX 1138.
[01:05:00.624 --> 01:05:05.205]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:05.205 --> 01:05:06.106]  Number one.
[01:05:06.106 --> 01:05:09.527]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:09.527 --> 01:05:10.407]  Number two.
[01:05:10.407 --> 01:05:15.289]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:05:15.289 --> 01:05:16.029]  It's true.
[01:05:16.029 --> 01:05:20.571]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:21.712]  Number 3.
[01:05:21.712 --> 01:05:25.295]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:25.295 --> 01:05:29.219]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:29.219 --> 01:05:30.019]  Number 4.
[01:05:30.019 --> 01:05:32.782]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:32.782 --> 01:05:36.465]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:37.266]  Number 5.
[01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:41.410]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:05:41.410 --> 01:05:46.174]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:46.434 --> 01:05:50.618]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.618 --> 01:05:52.400]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.662]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:05:54.662 --> 01:05:57.004]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:02.284 --> 01:06:06.245]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:06.245 --> 01:06:15.106]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:06:15.106 --> 01:06:19.727]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:30.549]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nanosilver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:06:31.169 --> 01:06:40.692]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:40.692 --> 01:06:46.114]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:06:46.114 --> 01:06:53.617]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:06:53.617 --> 01:06:56.358]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:07:01.491 --> 01:07:05.172]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:07:05.172 --> 01:07:08.733]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:13.534]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:07:13.534 --> 01:07:19.936]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:07:19.936 --> 01:07:22.177]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[01:07:22.697 --> 01:07:23.017]  Tim Geithner?
[01:07:23.017 --> 01:07:23.517]  Bernanke?
[01:07:23.517 --> 01:07:24.138]  They're arsonists!
[01:07:24.138 --> 01:07:24.858]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:07:24.858 --> 01:07:26.979]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:07:41.604 --> 01:07:43.746]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:07:43.746 --> 01:07:48.891]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:07:48.891 --> 01:07:58.000]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:08.976]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:08.976 --> 01:08:11.962]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:22.867 --> 01:08:24.549]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:08:24.549 --> 01:08:25.349]  to 3 p.m.
[01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:27.271]  Central Standard Time.
[01:08:27.271 --> 01:08:30.374]  We're here live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:08:30.374 --> 01:08:32.376]  This is the final radio transmission of 2009.
[01:08:32.376 --> 01:08:40.383]  The final Alex Jones Show radio transmission.
[01:08:40.383 --> 01:08:43.005]  Okay, coming up Webster Griffin Tarpley in the next hour.
[01:08:43.005 --> 01:08:46.268]  I'm gonna do a year-end review.
[01:08:48.379 --> 01:09:10.286]  A decade in review, the decade of tyranny, looking forward into what is the decade of awakening coming, and then I believe the decade of victory, in through and beyond 2020, which will be here before we know it.
[01:09:10.286 --> 01:09:12.047]  But right now, let's go to the phone calls.
[01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:15.508]  Now, I'm going to give each caller, and I always say this, can never do it, but I am doing it.
[01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:18.231]  One minute.
[01:09:18.231 --> 01:09:19.032]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:09:19.032 --> 01:09:20.293]  Mark in Oregon.
[01:09:20.293 --> 01:09:23.556]  Go ahead.
[01:09:23.556 --> 01:09:24.917]  Morning, Alex.
[01:09:24.917 --> 01:09:26.298]  Hey, buddy.
[01:09:26.298 --> 01:09:26.799]  Hey, Alex.
[01:09:26.799 --> 01:09:33.144]  You know, I just want to wish you and yours and all of us the best New Year's yet and really defeating evil.
[01:09:33.144 --> 01:09:35.986]  And that'll make it the best New Year's yet.
[01:09:35.986 --> 01:09:37.007]  More than we ever have.
[01:09:37.007 --> 01:09:40.090]  And I want to just give you a quick wish that I have.
[01:09:40.090 --> 01:09:43.813]  And it's kind of a combination of wish, suggestion and request.
[01:09:44.537 --> 01:09:58.625]  But you may have already had this concept, but I believe that concepts, new concepts, and ways of addressing the strategy of evil is really just so important at this time.
[01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:05.889]  And that is that perhaps you could consider convening a liberty conference, which could actually be top secret.
[01:10:06.708 --> 01:10:07.108]  Yes, we are.
[01:10:25.891 --> 01:10:27.933]  Okay, Mark, I appreciate your call.
[01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:29.434]  I don't have the organizational skills for that.
[01:10:29.434 --> 01:10:31.576]  I was just signing checks for my employees here during the break.
[01:10:53.996 --> 01:11:00.880]  I mean, people have had continental congresses and they've had meetings and some good comes out of that.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.063]  It's good to get the leaders in the Liberty Movement together.
[01:11:05.063 --> 01:11:08.485]  I don't think we're up to the 1776 point yet.
[01:11:08.485 --> 01:11:19.231]  And I don't think we've seen the caliber of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Sam Adams rise.
[01:11:23.376 --> 01:11:30.161]  But I think, as things become more apparent, we will see more and more people.
[01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:32.403]  Washington didn't come on the scene until very late.
[01:11:32.403 --> 01:11:36.647]  He wanted to go along with the system, but once he decided it was tyranny, he had to face it.
[01:11:36.647 --> 01:11:41.270]  And so there's a big wake-up happening right now.
[01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:47.615]  What I will do is attack any Benedict Arnold who attempts to take control of our awakening and our movement.
[01:11:47.615 --> 01:11:49.637]  That's why I'm forced to go after Glenn Beck.
[01:11:49.637 --> 01:11:51.699]  That guy is pure bad news.
[01:11:53.052 --> 01:11:55.694]  A Judas goat.
[01:11:55.694 --> 01:12:00.078]  And if you don't know how he's a Judas goat, you haven't been paying attention.
[01:12:00.078 --> 01:12:01.339]  Come on.
[01:12:01.339 --> 01:12:13.048]  For the banker bailout takeover, says the FEMA camps don't exist, is always bad-mouthing Ron Paul, then saying he likes Ron Paul.
[01:12:13.048 --> 01:12:16.711]  You gotta watch that man.
[01:12:16.711 --> 01:12:20.294]  Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in California.
[01:12:20.294 --> 01:12:20.795]  You're on the air.
[01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:23.498]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:12:23.498 --> 01:12:24.542]  Good, sir.
[01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:25.828]  As well as you can, I imagine.
[01:12:27.773 --> 01:12:31.235]  The situation that we face day in and day out.
[01:12:31.235 --> 01:12:44.323]  I want to say something that goes without saying for many of your listeners, but I want to say thank you to you and Aaron, and all the work that you've done over the last 10 years to bring everything to the forefront.
[01:12:44.323 --> 01:12:49.827]  I would like to thank those redcoats, those bloody redcoats, Paul and Steve, for what they've done.
[01:12:49.827 --> 01:12:52.369]  Thank goodness they haven't been beheaded at this point.
[01:12:52.369 --> 01:12:55.971]  And I want to kind of reminisce things that tied into Jesse's show last night.
[01:12:56.771 --> 01:13:02.895]  You know, it's a long way from Oklahoma City and aspartame.
[01:13:02.895 --> 01:13:20.566]  Aspartame was a big topic so many, many years ago on your show, and Jesse tied that in last night with Dr. Stan Monteith, and the whole thing about the assassination of the world population through the use of food is just unimaginable, yet it's true.
[01:13:22.027 --> 01:13:22.867]  I know!
[01:13:22.867 --> 01:13:37.257]  I mean, a national TV show that I heavily consulted on, I mean, to see my input, I mean, they presented it in the way they wanted to and they added a lot of their own research, but Monteith and Estalin
[01:13:38.138 --> 01:14:00.268]  And all these people I sent them to talk to, and to have Dr. Monteith there on television talking about how they put the poison in the food and how it's part of the larger program, and to have Ventura at the end of the show say, yes, there's a world government, yes, there's a Bilderberg Group, and yes, they're secret, and yes, they want to reduce our population.
[01:14:00.268 --> 01:14:00.748]  It's just...
[01:14:01.826 --> 01:14:07.451]  Yeah, it's so mind-boggling because here we have the former governor of Minnesota
[01:14:20.245 --> 01:14:23.087]  You know, addressing these issues.
[01:14:23.087 --> 01:14:24.347]  And it's out in the forefront.
[01:14:24.347 --> 01:14:28.570]  And I got one last thank you I want to send out, and that's to Ted Anderson.
[01:14:28.570 --> 01:14:37.314]  Because when you first started out, you were doing two hours, then you went to three hours, GCN with subscription only, now you hear Midas Resource commercials all over.
[01:14:37.314 --> 01:14:40.836]  Terrestrial Radio, Satellite Radio, he's doing a great job.
[01:14:40.836 --> 01:14:46.179]  And thank God that you guys are in it to win it.
[01:14:46.179 --> 01:14:47.200]  I can't thank you enough.
[01:14:48.686 --> 01:14:50.087]  I can't thank you enough, Michael.
[01:14:50.087 --> 01:14:52.489]  Yeah, in it to win it.
[01:14:52.489 --> 01:14:54.591]  In it to win it.
[01:14:54.591 --> 01:15:03.978]  Taking the bull by the horns, taking destiny by the horns, taking the wheel of destiny on the ship.
[01:15:03.978 --> 01:15:09.222]  Yeah, I happen to know Ted Anderson's finances, and Ted Anderson makes a lot less money than I do.
[01:15:09.222 --> 01:15:15.406]  Ted takes almost everything, all his profits.
[01:15:15.406 --> 01:15:16.968]  Very frugal guy, drives an old car.
[01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:20.112]  And puts it into advertising.
[01:15:20.112 --> 01:15:31.082]  And he's running advertising like I couldn't afford running ads on Rush Limbaugh and other places for Fall of the Republic.
[01:15:31.082 --> 01:15:42.252]  So Ted, I sell them to Ted, a tiny profit for myself, and then he sells them on there literally to get the word out.
[01:15:45.698 --> 01:15:49.241]  And it's barely breaking even.
[01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:50.542]  First time he did it, he didn't make money.
[01:15:50.542 --> 01:15:54.606]  The second time he ran ads, it's actually breaking even, making a little bit.
[01:15:54.606 --> 01:16:00.311]  And Ted, I mean, gave, was it $300,000 to Ron Paul or more?
[01:16:00.311 --> 01:16:02.273]  You're like, oh, well, he didn't win.
[01:16:02.273 --> 01:16:03.754]  Think now.
[01:16:03.754 --> 01:16:07.077]  Three years ago, maybe 1 in 10 knew the Federal Reserve was private.
[01:16:07.077 --> 01:16:09.519]  Now they've had national polls where over 80% know it's private.
[01:16:11.994 --> 01:16:15.117]  Two months ago it was 75% knew it was private and wanted it audited.
[01:16:15.117 --> 01:16:18.221]  I saw one 82% wanted audited like two weeks ago.
[01:16:18.221 --> 01:16:26.709]  A couple months from now 90% will know it's private and want it audited.
[01:16:26.709 --> 01:16:28.231]  We've gone from maybe 10% knowing to 80%?
[01:16:31.107 --> 01:16:43.972]  That's what, Ron Paul was just a focus, a focal point, to go out and say, to teach people about the offshore banks, the shadow government, the private fellow reserve, the new world order, the medicalized tyranny that Ron Paul talks about.
[01:16:43.972 --> 01:16:54.676]  See, our information has become so mainstream that if the mainstream TV doesn't cover some of it, they become obsolete.
[01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:55.396]  Obsolescence.
[01:17:00.086 --> 01:17:03.627]  I mean, I see national polls in some cases of over 90 percent.
[01:17:03.627 --> 01:17:05.948]  Usually it's 85, 86, 87.
[01:17:05.948 --> 01:17:08.369]  You've all seen them.
[01:17:08.369 --> 01:17:09.590]  I don't tend to believe one poll.
[01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:11.410]  I believe indexes of polls.
[01:17:11.410 --> 01:17:12.971]  And then I see that on the street as well.
[01:17:12.971 --> 01:17:14.991]  It's mirrored by that.
[01:17:14.991 --> 01:17:21.574]  And I... You've got around 10 percent of people that believe a lone gunman killed Kennedy.
[01:17:22.847 --> 01:17:30.372]  And no matter how many PR pieces and propaganda pieces and fake science pieces they put on TV, the number goes up and up and up.
[01:17:30.372 --> 01:17:31.753]  It's over 90% right now.
[01:17:31.753 --> 01:17:35.435]  90% is conservative.
[01:17:35.435 --> 01:17:38.317]  No, the government killed Kennedy.
[01:17:38.317 --> 01:17:39.798]  No, we've had a shadow government.
[01:17:39.798 --> 01:17:42.400]  I mean, Bruce Willis was a big neocon.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:49.224]  He saw my films, woke up, and now says to Vanity Fair, the same people that killed Kennedy are the ones running our government right now.
[01:17:49.224 --> 01:17:50.705]  We have a shadow government.
[01:17:50.705 --> 01:17:52.146]  Things aren't what I thought all along.
[01:17:53.288 --> 01:17:55.829]  See, he was that 10% still hadn't woken up.
[01:17:55.829 --> 01:17:57.950]  Bruce Willis is waking up.
[01:17:57.950 --> 01:18:03.612]  Just a blue collar, pro-military, red, white, and blue, hardy man.
[01:18:03.612 --> 01:18:05.552]  Blue collar.
[01:18:05.552 --> 01:18:07.733]  They're like, I love America?
[01:18:07.733 --> 01:18:09.914]  And the military wants to run a checkpoint and search me?
[01:18:09.914 --> 01:18:10.834]  It must be good.
[01:18:10.834 --> 01:18:14.155]  And now, Bruce Willis is finding out what it is to really be an American.
[01:18:14.155 --> 01:18:18.757]  He's going, wait a minute.
[01:18:18.757 --> 01:18:19.817]  Wait a minute.
[01:18:19.817 --> 01:18:21.298]  I'm not going to be a sucker anymore.
[01:18:22.461 --> 01:18:27.622]  I don't like the Democrats, but I don't like the Republicans either.
[01:18:27.622 --> 01:18:34.423]  See, once you wake up, ladies and gentlemen, once you wake up, there's no going back.
[01:18:34.423 --> 01:18:37.944]  Once you unlock somebody's mind, they're no longer a mind-controlled zombie.
[01:18:37.944 --> 01:18:39.124]  They see for themselves.
[01:18:39.124 --> 01:18:41.805]  You don't have to keep reapplying lies and propaganda.
[01:18:41.805 --> 01:18:46.845]  See, the enemy has to reapply their lies.
[01:18:46.845 --> 01:18:49.726]  And so you've got upwards of 90% of people are now awake.
[01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:56.181]  But the last domino to fall and it's beginning to teeter.
[01:18:56.181 --> 01:18:58.242]  And it's going to fall, the question is how fast.
[01:18:58.242 --> 01:19:00.762]  The faster the better.
[01:19:00.762 --> 01:19:07.864]  Every person you wake up, every person you try to wake up, they may not wake up that day, they'll wake up a year from now.
[01:19:07.864 --> 01:19:15.326]  When they see somebody at a bus stop calmly arguing with the cops, so the cops taser them, they'll go, oh, I remember what my neighbor told me about that.
[01:19:16.374 --> 01:19:22.895]  They'll keep driving, but they'll remember and say, I'm not safe if they can taser that innocent person for no reason.
[01:19:22.895 --> 01:19:24.056]  I better get involved.
[01:19:24.056 --> 01:19:32.338]  They'll start finding their courage, their willingness to fight, their willingness to say no, their willingness to say, I'm a human being.
[01:19:32.338 --> 01:19:33.218]  Get off my back.
[01:19:33.218 --> 01:19:35.198]  You're not my God.
[01:19:35.198 --> 01:19:38.939]  Good police will find their strength to say no to unlawful orders.
[01:19:38.939 --> 01:19:41.900]  We're finding our legs.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:42.920]  We're learning to stand up.
[01:19:44.209 --> 01:19:48.012]  The last domino to fall is that the majority is awake.
[01:19:48.012 --> 01:19:51.175]  We all just feel alone, so we're all sitting on our butts.
[01:19:51.175 --> 01:19:55.039]  But if we all just start speaking out, we'll all find each other.
[01:19:55.039 --> 01:19:56.580]  There's pockets of idiots out there.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:19:59.563]  When you run into morons, move on.
[01:19:59.563 --> 01:20:00.744]  Find like-minded people.
[01:20:01.767 --> 01:20:03.928]  Is your computer running slowly?
[01:20:03.928 --> 01:20:05.689]  Thinking about buying a new one?
[01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:06.889]  Don't waste your money!

[01:20:13.212 --> 01:20:14.893]  You don't need to buy a new computer.

[01:21:02.438 --> 01:21:06.485]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:21:06.485 --> 01:21:09.731]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:21:09.731 --> 01:21:11.134]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[01:21:11.832 --> 01:21:14.515]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:21:14.515 --> 01:21:20.901]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:21:20.901 --> 01:21:25.965]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:21:25.965 --> 01:21:36.095]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:21:36.195 --> 01:21:38.537]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[01:21:38.537 --> 01:21:40.138]  They're asking for more matches!
[01:21:40.138 --> 01:21:42.600]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.442]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:21:44.442 --> 01:21:49.866]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:21:49.866 --> 01:21:58.974]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:01.033 --> 01:22:11.061]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:11.061 --> 01:22:17.506]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.506 --> 01:22:26.353]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.733 --> 01:22:35.918]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:40.501]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[01:22:40.501 --> 01:22:42.322]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:42.322 --> 01:22:44.823]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:22:45.103 --> 01:22:48.428]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.

[01:22:53.496 --> 01:22:53.856]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.951 --> 01:23:03.374]  A revolution in smoking is underway.
[01:23:03.374 --> 01:23:07.217]  A revolution all smokers of traditional cigarettes should know about.

[01:23:58.329 --> 01:24:04.831]  The smoking gun heard round the world.
[01:24:04.831 --> 01:24:09.472]  Okay, let's go to Rick.
[01:24:09.472 --> 01:24:10.132]  Rick in Texas.
[01:24:10.132 --> 01:24:12.513]  Go ahead.
[01:24:12.513 --> 01:24:13.473]  Thank you for all you do.
[01:24:13.473 --> 01:24:16.054]  Listen, I just want to get two points.
[01:24:16.678 --> 01:24:19.560]  I was watching Jesse's show last night.
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:20.581]  Loved it.
[01:24:20.581 --> 01:24:24.064]  But right immediately after, did you notice what came on?
[01:24:24.064 --> 01:24:26.406]  It was all what you were talking about.
[01:24:26.406 --> 01:24:30.389]  It was a show about Homeland Security fighting terrorists.
[01:24:30.389 --> 01:24:31.730]  Oh yeah.
[01:24:31.730 --> 01:24:38.016]  Yeah, so they're trying to fight back, but it was so goofy that it just looked ridiculous to me.
[01:24:38.786 --> 01:24:56.115]  Yeah, the only reason I saw that, because I didn't watch it live last night, is that the YouTube video I pulled up this morning, and the DVD I burned, both had like a minute or two of the next show, and it went, terrorists during the Middle East planning an attack, but Homeland Security surveilling everyone to keep them safe.
[01:24:56.115 --> 01:24:59.697]  And it showed like a radar system spinning.
[01:24:59.697 --> 01:25:02.678]  So yeah, here's Big Brother, we're gonna keep you safe.
[01:25:02.678 --> 01:25:06.560]  Set up a police state grid, and then spike your water with sterilant.
[01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.621]  That's what it should have said, yes.
[01:25:08.567 --> 01:25:11.069]  It was laughable just at the timing of it.
[01:25:11.069 --> 01:25:16.335]  You know, they pulled it on there to try and wipe out a little bit of what we were doing.
[01:25:16.335 --> 01:25:24.723]  But also, another suggestion, one suggestion is the attorney, Mr. Haskell.
[01:25:24.723 --> 01:25:27.385]  He would be an excellent episode for Jesse to do.
[01:25:30.353 --> 01:25:34.096]  Well, we have to see if they get picked up for a second full season.
[01:25:34.096 --> 01:25:39.240]  Seven parts is called a full season, but it's a small season.
[01:25:39.240 --> 01:25:47.846]  Twelve, fourteen parts for a bigger season, and it's gotten the highest ratings for any true TV show in its first run.
[01:25:47.846 --> 01:25:53.070]  And so, if it doesn't get picked back up, you know why.
[01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:54.832]  He did his deal.
[01:25:54.832 --> 01:25:55.872]  He promised to be fair.
[01:25:56.992 --> 01:25:57.453]  We're good.
[01:26:18.010 --> 01:26:21.251]  And you know, I've plugged every other episode, but this one I kind of forgot about.
[01:26:21.251 --> 01:26:26.732]  This big episode coming up that I'm a huge part of, the biggest part of any of the episodes.
[01:26:26.732 --> 01:26:30.653]  And I didn't even plug the episode that I mainly feature in until yesterday.
[01:26:30.653 --> 01:26:34.573]  We put a blurb out on InfoWars.com.
[01:26:34.573 --> 01:26:36.574]  But I'm going to talk more about it in the last hour.
[01:26:36.574 --> 01:26:47.056]  It's just to see open discussion of the Globalist Master Plan on national television and how they're poisoning the food, the water, the drugs.
[01:26:47.876 --> 01:26:48.858]  It was incredible.
[01:26:48.858 --> 01:26:53.666]  I mean, it was absolutely amazing.
[01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:54.207]  Thank you, Rick.
[01:26:54.207 --> 01:26:55.990]  I appreciate your call.
[01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:57.172]  John in Ohio.
[01:26:57.172 --> 01:26:57.733]  You're on the air.
[01:26:58.897 --> 01:27:17.576]  Yes, Alex, I agree and cheered on everything you've said up until now about the 9-11 truth, about Glenn Beck, this rat who probably got more blood on his hands from every day on his radio program, peddling the lies even beyond what Bush and Cheney did to drag us into Iraq.
[01:27:18.592 --> 01:27:23.697]  The guy's a total phony, the global warming hoax, the vaccines, everything.
[01:27:23.697 --> 01:27:40.392]  But I would ask if you would have Professor Grover Furr, Furr with two R's, or Michael Parenti on your program, because I think though you do a yeoman's service in exposing things that are really teeing off the globalist,
[01:27:41.036 --> 01:27:50.584]  On the other hand, I believe that you are promoting one of the most establishment CIA disinformation, the most extreme version of it.
[01:27:50.584 --> 01:27:59.111]  Whenever you refer to anything having to do with communism or Marxism, this kind of broad-brush is what has been used to kill millions of people around the world.
[01:27:59.531 --> 01:27:59.731]  I think?
[01:28:17.136 --> 01:28:35.946]  Because I think the one reason that you have some success, partial success in the media, is because they really hate what you're exposing about the things I just mentioned, but they love your extreme version of the CIA Operation Mockingbird anti-communist propaganda.
[01:28:35.946 --> 01:28:39.048]  So I really believe that, and I think you ought to.
[01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:40.889]  John, you've been calling for what, five, six years?
[01:28:41.874 --> 01:28:45.698]  Yeah, so I know what you're about and I support much of what you're talking about.
[01:28:45.698 --> 01:28:46.979]  John, I appreciate your call.
[01:28:46.979 --> 01:28:52.944]  You call in about once a month and it's like a replay of the same thing.
[01:28:52.944 --> 01:29:06.517]  Just because I don't like the New World Order, Europe, the United States, England, and Israel, with what they're doing, because big government always becomes corrupt and always becomes bad.
[01:29:07.543 --> 01:29:15.489]  Not because they're Jews, not because they're British, not because we're American, but because we've got a big, corrupt, old government.
[01:29:15.489 --> 01:29:17.110]  That's why empires always fall.
[01:29:17.110 --> 01:29:19.012]  They become corrupt.
[01:29:19.012 --> 01:29:21.333]  Nations always fall.
[01:29:21.333 --> 01:29:24.075]  I'm not against Mexicans.
[01:29:24.075 --> 01:29:26.037]  I'm against the corruption of Mexico.
[01:29:28.789 --> 01:29:33.850]  So just because I don't like the corruption of our government doesn't mean I like communists.
[01:29:33.850 --> 01:29:35.731]  And you get so confused by this.
[01:29:35.731 --> 01:29:38.312]  I'm against corruption.
[01:29:38.312 --> 01:29:39.892]  I'm against collectivism.
[01:29:39.892 --> 01:29:43.753]  I'm going to explain this to you, John, on the other side.
[01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:51.615]  Then I'm going to go to Chase, Julio, Chief and others.
[01:29:51.615 --> 01:29:52.995]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.995 --> 01:29:55.516]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.516 --> 01:29:58.217]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.428 --> 01:30:04.450]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:09.773]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:30:09.773 --> 01:30:11.814]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:30:11.814 --> 01:30:16.817]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:30:16.817 --> 01:30:17.738]  How much do you want?
[01:30:17.998 --> 01:30:19.119]  When do you want it?
[01:30:19.119 --> 01:30:21.001]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:22.082]  When will you need it?
[01:30:22.082 --> 01:30:24.284]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:30:24.284 --> 01:30:25.625]  Will there be any food?
[01:30:25.625 --> 01:30:27.146]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:30:27.146 --> 01:30:32.431]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:30:32.431 --> 01:30:36.015]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:30:36.015 --> 01:30:39.478]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:30:39.818 --> 01:30:41.039]  How much will you need?
[01:30:41.039 --> 01:30:41.940]  We don't know.
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:43.061]  How much do you want?
[01:30:43.061 --> 01:30:43.982]  All you can get.
[01:30:43.982 --> 01:30:45.083]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:30:45.083 --> 01:30:48.127]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:30:48.127 --> 01:30:49.908]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:30:49.908 --> 01:30:50.829]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:31:00.419 --> 01:31:04.522]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.
[01:31:04.522 --> 01:31:07.385]  It produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[01:31:07.385 --> 01:31:09.486]  No, this isn't science fiction, it's very real.
[01:31:09.486 --> 01:31:11.728]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[01:31:11.728 --> 01:31:13.389]  And it's available right now to you.
[01:31:13.389 --> 01:31:17.693]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.

[01:32:00.154 --> 01:32:05.461]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[01:32:05.461 --> 01:32:10.007]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[01:32:10.007 --> 01:32:12.270]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?

[01:32:58.126 --> 01:33:03.150]  All the leaves are brown.
[01:33:03.150 --> 01:33:08.275]  And the sky is gray.
[01:33:17.179 --> 01:33:26.105]  John calling in from Ohio.
[01:33:26.105 --> 01:33:30.708]  Said why... You guys got audio feeding to me?
[01:33:30.708 --> 01:33:34.510]  Because I just caught some audio through my headphones.
[01:33:34.510 --> 01:33:37.892]  That's weird.
[01:33:37.892 --> 01:33:39.573]  Oh, you were telling me we've already gone to John.
[01:33:39.573 --> 01:33:40.514]  No, I know John's gone.
[01:33:42.952 --> 01:33:44.193]  So is John still on hold?
[01:33:44.193 --> 01:33:55.081]  I mean, how would we go to break, leave, then I mention the caller and then he's put back on with me?
[01:33:55.081 --> 01:33:56.803]  Okay.
[01:33:56.803 --> 01:34:04.609]  Again, I just knew I had a caller talking in my ear here.
[01:34:04.609 --> 01:34:07.271]  All right, final radio broadcast of 2009.
[01:34:13.277 --> 01:34:16.100]  Final radio broadcast of 2009.
[01:34:16.100 --> 01:34:27.890]  And John from Ohio calls in, and John is not stupid.
[01:34:27.890 --> 01:34:30.332]  John is on a team.
[01:34:30.332 --> 01:34:35.436]  John has invested most of his life in being a communist.
[01:34:35.436 --> 01:34:37.038]  He's admitted on air he's a communist.
[01:34:39.912 --> 01:34:49.255]  But then when I say that I don't want communism, why I'm spewing what the CIA puts out as its rhetoric.
[01:34:49.255 --> 01:34:56.237]  John, the Soviets have released their archives.
[01:34:56.237 --> 01:35:01.978]  The Soviets have released their archives.
[01:35:01.978 --> 01:35:03.779]  And it turns out McCarthy was right.
[01:35:06.013 --> 01:35:22.430]  And when Joseph McCarthy found out there was a group above the communists, big industrialist bankers, on record, and when he found out the army was funding communists and giving them weapon secrets, which has now been declassified, he wasn't useful anymore.
[01:35:23.410 --> 01:35:37.625]  Yes, in the dialectic, communism was meant to be a limited threat of the Russians and an excuse to put US forces all over the world to oppose the other arm of the banker that was the communist.
[01:35:37.625 --> 01:35:39.167]  That's the beautiful dialectic.
[01:35:39.167 --> 01:35:44.512]  The communists get to move out and invade countries in the name of countering the West and its imperialism.
[01:35:45.373 --> 01:35:52.977]  And then the West gets to go out and start conquering countries in the name of stopping the domino effect of the evil empire of communism.
[01:35:52.977 --> 01:36:00.160]  When both arms unknowingly at the mid and lower levels were compartmentalized part of the same system.
[01:36:01.630 --> 01:36:05.892]  Just like the Republicans and the Democrats, or the Conservatives and Labor.
[01:36:05.892 --> 01:36:09.153]  Both the major political parties in every country are controlled.
[01:36:09.153 --> 01:36:23.598]  And now I can have members of the European Parliament on, former governors on, congressmen on, and they'll all explain that the globalist game is a false debate, a false dichotomy, a false system.
[01:36:23.598 --> 01:36:27.100]  You go to a football game and it's the Yellow Jackets versus the Bears.
[01:36:28.388 --> 01:36:32.494]  Or it's the Cowboys versus the Raiders.
[01:36:32.494 --> 01:36:35.499]  You go to a high school football game.
[01:36:35.499 --> 01:36:39.004]  Or it's the Mountain Lions versus the Blue Devils.
[01:36:39.004 --> 01:36:43.150]  Whatever it is!
[01:36:43.150 --> 01:36:43.470]  Okay?
[01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:55.396]  But there's a world outside that game, outside the parking lot, outside the cheerleaders, outside the high school coaches, outside the nachos and cotton candy and Frito-Pie.
[01:36:55.396 --> 01:36:56.737]  There's a bigger world.
[01:36:56.737 --> 01:36:59.258]  I'm not in your little sports stadium, John.
[01:36:59.258 --> 01:37:00.379]  Get it through your head.
[01:37:00.379 --> 01:37:04.701]  You've been calling for five, six years, maybe longer, and you don't get that.
[01:37:04.701 --> 01:37:08.643]  And other leftist and admitted communists don't get it.
[01:37:08.643 --> 01:37:11.085]  I am holding in my hand the Saul Alinsky's
[01:37:12.441 --> 01:37:13.462]  Books.
[01:37:13.462 --> 01:37:14.943]  We own them in this office.
[01:37:14.943 --> 01:37:20.889]  In my hand I am holding Hillary Clinton's treatise.
[01:37:20.889 --> 01:37:27.735]  Written about the Alinsky method where she agrees with communism and covertly taking over local governments.
[01:37:32.230 --> 01:37:39.071]  Now, you read her treatise from the late 1960s, and it's word-for-word what Joseph McCarthy said.
[01:37:39.071 --> 01:37:44.452]  It's just from a communist perspective of how you're infiltrating and taking over.
[01:37:44.452 --> 01:37:54.314]  Except she's funded by the Ford Foundation, the Annenberg Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, the Carnegie Endowment.
[01:37:54.314 --> 01:37:56.315]  I mean, who do you think funded the 1917 coup in Russia?
[01:38:00.362 --> 01:38:06.805]  Our criminal, stinking government, along with British intelligence.
[01:38:06.805 --> 01:38:14.008]  You don't think that the empire sends in commandos and says, hey, we're another empire here to overthrow you.
[01:38:14.008 --> 01:38:14.568]  No!
[01:38:14.568 --> 01:38:15.949]  Workers of the world, unite!
[01:38:15.949 --> 01:38:17.750]  We are commies!
[01:38:17.750 --> 01:38:19.490]  We're here to give you free stuff!
[01:38:19.490 --> 01:38:23.432]  You don't like that landowner your family's been slaving for for ten generations?
[01:38:23.432 --> 01:38:24.773]  We're gonna kill him tonight!
[01:38:25.953 --> 01:38:31.934]  And I'm gonna make you my local lieutenant and you get to rob the other neighbors and send people to camps.
[01:38:31.934 --> 01:38:32.794]  How does that sound?
[01:38:32.794 --> 01:38:34.715]  And they find the one thug and they do it.
[01:38:34.715 --> 01:38:36.775]  You wanna rape that other farmer's daughter?
[01:38:36.775 --> 01:38:37.895]  She looks good.
[01:38:37.895 --> 01:38:39.896]  Yes, but she is poor like us.
[01:38:39.896 --> 01:38:44.477]  She is not part of the bourgeoisie or part of the elite.
[01:38:44.477 --> 01:38:46.457]  It does not matter, Drago.
[01:38:46.457 --> 01:38:47.257]  Rape her.
[01:38:47.257 --> 01:38:48.398]  Enjoy her.
[01:38:48.398 --> 01:38:50.278]  Have her for yourself.
[01:38:55.452 --> 01:38:59.115]  That's all it is.
[01:38:59.115 --> 01:39:01.057]  And when Stalin kicked out the U.S.
[01:39:01.057 --> 01:39:03.379]  team, Trotsky just came back to the U.S.
[01:39:03.379 --> 01:39:15.128]  and his top protégé, William Kristol's daddy, openly a top commie, was hired by the Pentagon and runs everything.
[01:39:15.128 --> 01:39:17.190]  I mean, that's how America works.
[01:39:17.190 --> 01:39:18.471]  I mean, what do you think this is?
[01:39:18.471 --> 01:39:20.212]  I mean, the neocon stage 9-11.
[01:39:25.057 --> 01:39:39.240]  Your precious Trotsky was nothing but a banker-operator, a professional revolutionary who got double-crossed by Lenin and then Stalin.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:51.722]  And Stalin had somebody go down to Mexico City and put a hatchet in his head because he knew that the United States was funding Trotsky to go back in there with a group of revolutionaries and overthrow him!
[01:39:58.604 --> 01:40:01.066]  No honor among thieves.
[01:40:01.066 --> 01:40:04.388]  There is no such thing as communism.
[01:40:04.388 --> 01:40:07.770]  There is no such thing as collectivism unless it's slavery.
[01:40:07.770 --> 01:40:10.632]  You have a banker bailout to help people with their mortgages.
[01:40:10.632 --> 01:40:14.155]  Day one, they bait and switch it and give it all the banks for giant bonuses.
[01:40:14.155 --> 01:40:14.915]  In your face.
[01:40:14.915 --> 01:40:16.497]  And say, we won't say where it went.
[01:40:16.497 --> 01:40:20.720]  You get government health care all you stupid collectivists and liberals are for.
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:23.822]  Day one, you finally get the bill and you go, what?
[01:40:23.822 --> 01:40:25.223]  It's too late to stop it?
[01:40:27.199 --> 01:40:35.301]  You mean I get less free healthcare but you get more money?
[01:40:35.301 --> 01:40:36.722]  There is no free lunch.
[01:40:36.722 --> 01:40:38.342]  There is no free ride.
[01:40:38.342 --> 01:40:48.865]  The only way you have a free system is to have a tiny government and an armed citizenry so when private robber barons try to come rob you like the Rockefellers did, you can stand up for yourself.
[01:40:48.865 --> 01:40:50.266]  It's independence.
[01:40:50.266 --> 01:40:52.166]  That's what it's about.
[01:40:52.166 --> 01:40:54.467]  The CIA is an anti-communist.
[01:40:58.527 --> 01:41:12.596]  They're only anti-communist if it's a real communist organization that picked up their fake ideology, their banker-created synthetic ideology, that are setting up their own thugdom that isn't working with the globalists.
[01:41:12.596 --> 01:41:14.858]  If you're a communist and you work with the globalists, you're good.
[01:41:14.858 --> 01:41:23.464]  But if you're some Central American or South American individual, a thug or not, and you don't play ball, you get overthrown.
[01:41:23.464 --> 01:41:28.087]  If you're a right-winger and you don't play ball, you're overthrown.
[01:41:29.099 --> 01:41:39.568]  If you're a bleeding heart real liberal like Mohamed Mozadek and fight communists, you get overthrown.
[01:41:39.568 --> 01:41:44.933]  If you're Serbians running your own free market system, you get overthrown.
[01:41:44.933 --> 01:41:48.876]  If you're a dictator like Muammar Gaddafi with his own oil, you get overthrown.
[01:41:48.876 --> 01:41:51.178]  Unless you play ball, now he's good.
[01:41:51.178 --> 01:41:52.540]  We've never been at war with East Asia.
[01:41:52.540 --> 01:41:53.781]  We've always been at war with East Asia.
[01:41:54.605 --> 01:41:56.066]  Remember 1984?
[01:41:56.066 --> 01:41:58.568]  Gaddafi's the ultimate evil, the absolute devil incarnate.
[01:41:58.568 --> 01:42:00.369]  Now he's a wonderful ally.
[01:42:00.369 --> 01:42:01.449]  A gallant ally.
[01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:04.972]  Alright, I want to go back to your calls.
[01:42:04.972 --> 01:42:13.017]  It's just, John, I don't like wasting my time, but we do have new listeners and it's important to explain to them.
[01:42:13.017 --> 01:42:18.680]  Communism is a fake worldview.
[01:42:18.680 --> 01:42:19.361]  Karl Marx
[01:42:20.885 --> 01:42:36.243]  Ingalls they were openly financed by big money out of England and Germany just like Lord Milner's group financed several different right-wing revolutions Adolf Hitler namely and
[01:42:37.435 --> 01:42:43.579]  British-backed German intelligence put him into power, then told him to attack, then set him up.
[01:42:43.579 --> 01:42:45.560]  He had a peace treaty with the British.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:49.623]  They sent the Deputy Fuhrer, Rudolf Hess, over to say, we had a deal with you.
[01:42:49.623 --> 01:42:51.184]  Why are you doing this to us?
[01:42:51.184 --> 01:42:53.025]  Why are you betraying us?
[01:42:53.025 --> 01:43:04.032]  We were to link up with Edward VIII, your king, and take on the Soviets and set up a pan-German British empire run by a British monarch.
[01:43:07.261 --> 01:43:14.726]  I mean, did you know that was the official plan?
[01:43:14.726 --> 01:43:19.549]  Prince Bernhard was gonna be the King of Europe!
[01:43:19.549 --> 01:43:24.513]  But then he got the word after the German invasion already began, no, actually come to England, plans have changed.
[01:43:24.513 --> 01:43:32.858]  So he took off his SS officer's uniform, went and joined the other Nazi, his cousin, Prince Philip, what is he, 81, 82 now?
[01:43:36.007 --> 01:43:41.191]  The Duke of Edinburgh.
[01:43:41.191 --> 01:43:46.996]  This is high-level, ultra-intrigue.
[01:43:46.996 --> 01:43:57.085]  The British royals have successfully double-crossed all their other royal family branches and murdered all of them.
[01:43:57.085 --> 01:43:58.546]  They're the only people standing.
[01:44:01.769 --> 01:44:13.092]  Did you know the Emperor of Japan bows, and I've seen it on television, goes to events every decade or so at the Tower of London to give fealty to the Queen as the head of all royalty worldwide?
[01:44:13.092 --> 01:44:16.593]  Because if you don't, she'll overthrow your country and kill you!
[01:44:16.593 --> 01:44:22.014]  The British engineered World War II in a 30-year plan and overthrew Japan!
[01:44:22.014 --> 01:44:25.295]  That's why he bows to her!
[01:44:25.295 --> 01:44:29.396]  That woman over there rules the planet!
[01:44:29.396 --> 01:44:30.476]  With the Rothschilds.
[01:44:31.598 --> 01:44:35.425]  Who've married in with them.
[01:44:35.425 --> 01:44:39.032]  This is a super breed of all the world's elite innerbred.
[01:44:48.288 --> 01:44:54.711]  They didn't like their cousins, the Czars, who'd stopped the breakup of the U.S.
[01:44:54.711 --> 01:44:57.553]  during the Civil War in the 1860s.
[01:44:57.553 --> 01:45:12.501]  They had gotten out of favor with each other, so the British Royals, along with the United States and Army Intelligence, hired 8,000 thugs out of Brooklyn and gave them weapons and gold and sent them over there to overthrow that country, and that's mainline history!
[01:45:14.544 --> 01:45:17.166]  Our criminal government created the United Nations in 1945.
[01:45:17.166 --> 01:45:21.248]  The Rockefellers gave them the land for it.
[01:45:21.248 --> 01:45:26.452]  Our criminal government created the Communist scourge.
[01:45:26.452 --> 01:45:32.295]  And as soon as McCarthy figured that out, he was destroyed.
[01:45:32.295 --> 01:45:39.520]  Oh, he was very useful to set up warrantless wiretapping and spying and torture and bullying the media to do what they were told.
[01:45:40.754 --> 01:45:45.538]  Setting the precedent for censorship for the Pentagon and the FBI?
[01:45:45.538 --> 01:45:53.203]  Oh, it was very useful when it was just a ground-level commie scourge.
[01:45:53.203 --> 01:46:06.012]  But when McCarthy found out it was run out of the White House, when he found out the whole thing was run by big banks and started giving speeches, they destroyed him overnight.
[01:46:06.012 --> 01:46:07.393]  Was he a hothead?
[01:46:07.393 --> 01:46:09.195]  Was he a guy that liked to drink?
[01:46:09.195 --> 01:46:09.415]  Yes.
[01:46:10.899 --> 01:46:13.500]  But was he somebody who actually believed he was fighting evil?
[01:46:13.500 --> 01:46:15.461]  Yes.
[01:46:15.461 --> 01:46:18.442]  So, how does our military get to go out and take over the planet?
[01:46:18.442 --> 01:46:22.404]  How do our military men go out and torture people and kill people and stage terror attacks?
[01:46:22.404 --> 01:46:29.306]  Well, you gotta do it, because the Soviets do it, and if we don't do it, they're gonna win, and they're gonna kill tens of millions.
[01:46:29.306 --> 01:46:32.448]  And so we gotta do it, men.
[01:46:32.448 --> 01:46:35.689]  And then decades later, we gotta do this, men, to the World Trade Center towers.
[01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:40.371]  If we don't, Muslim extremists will take over and kill millions.
[01:46:40.371 --> 01:46:41.391]  So we'll kill thousands.
[01:46:41.391 --> 01:46:43.372]  You understand the unjustifies the means.
[01:46:43.372 --> 01:46:43.892]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:43.892 --> 01:46:45.272]  It's just like triage.
[01:46:45.272 --> 01:46:47.653]  That's right.
[01:46:47.653 --> 01:46:50.673]  That's why you've been chosen for leadership in the past missions.
[01:46:50.673 --> 01:46:55.195]  You're the only guardians we've got of Western civilization, man.
[01:46:55.195 --> 01:46:59.876]  We launched the operation in 62 days.
[01:46:59.876 --> 01:47:04.017]  Operation Save America.
[01:47:04.017 --> 01:47:04.777]  And they walked out
[01:47:06.755 --> 01:47:15.199]  Proud of themselves that they were real men ready to blow up the towers.
[01:47:15.199 --> 01:47:20.762]  Real men.
[01:47:20.762 --> 01:47:28.366]  But you've got all these people caught up in their left-right paradigm and they can't see the forest for the trees and they can't get out of it.
[01:47:28.366 --> 01:47:31.867]  And so right-wingers will give up all their rights to the right-wing.
[01:47:31.867 --> 01:47:34.369]  And left-wingers will do whatever they say as long as it's a Democrat.
[01:47:35.177 --> 01:47:40.361]  And John doesn't like hearing communists talk bad about.
[01:47:40.361 --> 01:47:42.262]  Gee, what are the fruits like of communism?
[01:47:42.262 --> 01:47:43.463]  Look at China.
[01:47:43.463 --> 01:47:48.047]  Look at Cuba.
[01:47:48.047 --> 01:47:51.409]  Look at Russia.
[01:47:51.409 --> 01:47:58.335]  All I see is the same old tyranny I've seen dressed up a hundred different ways, pal.
[01:47:58.335 --> 01:48:03.739]  No, the reason that maybe twice a year I'm on national television
[01:48:05.242 --> 01:48:17.126]  Is because they've got to give us a teeny bit of a voice to give a little bit of the illusion that they have objectivity and that they're still relevant and pertinent and not obsolete.
[01:48:17.126 --> 01:48:27.630]  And because if 90% of the public already knows about the New World Order, the system's got to ease people into this now and just go ahead and admit it in plain view.
[01:48:27.630 --> 01:48:28.870]  Yeah, there's a world government.
[01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:30.751]  Yeah, we're poisoning you, but it's for your own good.
[01:48:30.751 --> 01:48:32.411]  You know, that's the basic message.
[01:48:32.411 --> 01:48:33.892]  They can't deny it anymore.
[01:48:37.059 --> 01:48:38.120]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.923]  Let's talk to Chase in Texas and Julio, Chris, and others.
[01:48:40.923 --> 01:48:42.284]  Go ahead.
[01:48:42.284 --> 01:48:42.825]  Howdy, Alex.
[01:48:42.825 --> 01:48:44.186]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:48:44.186 --> 01:48:46.128]  Thanks for holding.
[01:48:46.128 --> 01:48:48.791]  Yesterday I just wanted to make three brief key points.
[01:48:48.791 --> 01:48:52.034]  Number one, soy.
[01:48:52.034 --> 01:48:52.574]  S-O-Y.
[01:48:52.574 --> 01:48:52.995]  Soy.
[01:48:52.995 --> 01:48:54.576]  We need to get it out of our diet.
[01:48:54.576 --> 01:48:55.277]  That's number one.
[01:48:55.277 --> 01:48:55.577]  Super deadly.
[01:48:55.577 --> 01:48:59.581]  They feed it to people in the prisons and they're dying in mass and becoming sterilized.
[01:48:59.581 --> 01:49:00.042]  It's horrible.
[01:49:00.754 --> 01:49:01.094]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:01.094 --> 01:49:06.695]  It's lowering the testosterone levels of the men, and that's one of the reasons why a lot of them are still sitting on their hands.
[01:49:06.695 --> 01:49:07.836]  Well, it's not just that.
[01:49:07.836 --> 01:49:11.357]  They picked a plastic that leaches it out of thousands they could have picked.
[01:49:11.357 --> 01:49:12.697]  They put it in the water.
[01:49:12.697 --> 01:49:20.719]  Everything they do, aspartame, fluoride, soy, everything that's chosen, and then there's even white papers, how they chose it to sterilize you.
[01:49:21.584 --> 01:49:35.911]  Yes sir, it's pitiful, but that's why I take it so personal because I've been watered down as a man, but I've supplemented it back because testosterone does occur in nature through spinach and a root called maca root, but I digress.
[01:49:35.911 --> 01:49:38.372]  I don't want more testosterone.
[01:49:38.372 --> 01:49:44.075]  I would like literally be attacking people every five minutes, but yeah, a lot of people have very low testosterone.
[01:49:45.479 --> 01:49:46.380]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.882]  Secondly, C-SPAN.
[01:49:47.882 --> 01:49:54.169]  I've been watching Washington Journal here lately, and in my opinion, I think about 40 to 45 percent of the call-ins
[01:49:54.631 --> 01:50:00.054]  Are starting to sound like folks like us who are well-versed in the lies and manipulation that are taking place.
[01:50:00.054 --> 01:50:00.734]  So I think that's really good.
[01:50:00.734 --> 01:50:01.114]  Exactly!
[01:50:01.114 --> 01:50:02.295]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:50:02.295 --> 01:50:03.335]  Everybody's calling me.
[01:50:03.335 --> 01:50:15.641]  I see clips that are put up on C-SPAN where Governor, you know, the former head of Homeland Security, Chertoff, goes on and literally, out of 20, 30 calls, every caller but one were against him and knew he was New World Order.
[01:50:15.641 --> 01:50:16.202]  Exactly!
[01:50:16.202 --> 01:50:17.382]  That's what I mean!
[01:50:17.382 --> 01:50:19.123]  They're in trouble, folks!
[01:50:19.123 --> 01:50:19.523]  Go ahead.
[01:50:19.523 --> 01:50:23.165]  Yeah, and we just got to keep calling in and keep turning up the heat.
[01:50:23.601 --> 01:50:31.446]  And my third point, sir, I really feel that in 2010, we've got a momentum behind us right now that we've really never had.
[01:50:31.446 --> 01:50:37.530]  And we're going to carry this into this new year of 2010, and 2010 is going to be a year of absolute... Start over, Chase.
[01:50:37.530 --> 01:50:38.510]  I interrupted you a bunch.
[01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.831]  Stay there.
[01:50:38.831 --> 01:50:39.411]  I'm going to come back.
[01:50:39.411 --> 01:50:40.572]  I want to hear what you have to say.
[01:50:43.317 --> 01:50:43.917]  Chief.
[01:50:43.917 --> 01:50:45.438]  That's a cool name.
[01:50:45.438 --> 01:50:47.499]  Chris, Travis, and others straight ahead.
[01:50:47.499 --> 01:50:48.680]  Absolutely.
[01:50:48.680 --> 01:50:51.541]  Our mission is to teach people that we do have power.
[01:50:51.541 --> 01:50:55.463]  Look at how the Copenhagen talks went down in flames.
[01:50:55.463 --> 01:51:01.526]  That's a lot bigger than the Trenton victory politically.
[01:51:01.526 --> 01:51:04.487]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[01:51:05.367 --> 01:51:08.792]  Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[01:51:08.792 --> 01:51:12.517]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[01:51:12.517 --> 01:51:20.367]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride, and contaminants
[01:51:20.367 --> 01:51:20.607]  I think so.

[01:52:01.337 --> 01:52:02.637]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.637 --> 01:52:08.219]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:08.219 --> 01:52:13.241]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:13.241 --> 01:52:18.262]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.809 --> 01:52:24.030]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:24.030 --> 01:52:31.152]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:31.152 --> 01:52:32.272]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.272 --> 01:52:38.953]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.953 --> 01:52:41.714]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:42.130 --> 01:52:47.611]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:47.611 --> 01:52:50.371]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:50.371 --> 01:52:57.993]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.993 --> 01:53:01.053]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[01:53:01.053 --> 01:53:01.733]  Hello!
[01:53:01.733 --> 01:53:06.474]  At OfTheField.com, we strive to empower you with wild food preparedness.
[01:53:06.474 --> 01:53:10.875]  We get lots of amazing positive feedback, most of which we feature on OfTheField.com.
[01:53:13.353 --> 01:53:16.435]  People like you have to say about the wild food experience.
[01:53:16.435 --> 01:53:20.538]  It's inspiring for many who are affected by the recent downturn of the economy.
[01:53:20.538 --> 01:53:24.581]  I already knew a bit about foraging and edibles, but you take it to a whole new level.
[01:53:24.581 --> 01:53:27.383]  A thousand thanks to you for all that great knowledge.
[01:53:27.383 --> 01:53:28.404]  It was empowering.
[01:53:28.404 --> 01:53:32.387]  When I was in the Navy, I went through a couple of quick land survival classes.
[01:53:32.387 --> 01:53:35.209]  Thank you for being an inspiration and for all the work that you do.
[01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:37.971]  I really appreciate the depth and detail of the information.
[01:53:37.971 --> 01:53:39.051]  Thank you so much.
[01:53:39.051 --> 01:53:41.914]  Much love and respect to you from all of us here in the boonies.
[01:53:41.914 --> 01:53:42.434]  Thanks again.
[01:53:42.634 --> 01:53:46.017]  Knowledge is power and that power brings peace.
[01:53:46.017 --> 01:53:49.440]  Folks, thanks for letting us help you get back to basics.
[01:53:49.440 --> 01:53:53.023]  Read all of the testimonials at ofthefield.com.
[01:53:53.023 --> 01:53:57.026]  You can order online for you and your loved ones or call 1-888-51-EAT-FREE to share in the secret.
[01:54:11.716 --> 01:54:15.019]  There's a man going around taking names.
[01:54:15.019 --> 01:54:16.740]  It's our last live show of the year.
[01:54:16.740 --> 01:54:19.662]  He decides who to free and who to blame.
[01:54:19.662 --> 01:54:22.084]  It's the final day of 2009.
[01:54:22.084 --> 01:54:23.726]  Everybody will be treated.
[01:54:23.726 --> 01:54:26.748]  December 31st.
[01:54:26.748 --> 01:54:29.991]  There'll be a golden letter reaching down.
[01:54:29.991 --> 01:54:34.794]  When the man... When the man comes around.
[01:54:39.598 --> 01:54:50.344]  Alright, going back to your calls.
[01:54:50.344 --> 01:54:54.646]  The establishment will try to send Judas Goats.
[01:54:54.646 --> 01:54:58.008]  They will send Obama to lead the left into betrayal.
[01:54:58.008 --> 01:54:59.889]  They will send Glenn Beck.
[01:54:59.889 --> 01:55:01.670]  They will send Sarah Palin.
[01:55:01.670 --> 01:55:05.292]  They will send Mitt Romney to betray the right wing.
[01:55:07.921 --> 01:55:12.624]  And until you wake up that both of those are controlled, things are only going to get worse.
[01:55:12.624 --> 01:55:22.931]  Until you start addressing the real power structure, the Federal Reserve, the author of all our pain, economically, and all the tyranny being set up, it's only going to get worse.
[01:55:22.931 --> 01:55:27.294]  And the people are now beginning to wake up.
[01:55:27.294 --> 01:55:30.656]  Never before has the fight been more intense, and it did all of you.
[01:55:32.281 --> 01:55:39.586]  To scream bloody murder today, tomorrow, next year, the year after that, never stop!
[01:55:39.586 --> 01:55:49.994]  Because what we've proven is, if you listen to C-SPAN, or listen to talk radio, or look at the polls on any issue, we've just begun the awakening.
[01:55:49.994 --> 01:55:52.155]  Finish up, Chase.
[01:55:52.155 --> 01:56:01.382]  Alright, yeah, I just wanted to say, 2010 is going to be a year of absolute victory, when we the InfoWarriors start speaking what we want into existence.
[01:56:02.052 --> 01:56:07.255]  And we have a momentum behind our backs right now that's really going to set the tone for this year.
[01:56:07.255 --> 01:56:14.159]  Yes, they have the cards and they can do what they want, but we have the numbers and victory is on the horizon.
[01:56:14.159 --> 01:56:15.440]  It's coming.
[01:56:15.440 --> 01:56:19.242]  And we, you know, the future's not yet written.
[01:56:19.242 --> 01:56:26.106]  And it's just a really a wonderful time to be alive because I don't know about y'all, but I'm ready to be living like George Jetson.
[01:56:26.106 --> 01:56:28.908]  And I do not want to turn back into Fred Flintstone.
[01:56:28.908 --> 01:56:30.989]  And it's time that all of the
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:36.844]  Innovation and the wonderful things that have been suppressed from it are out there for everyone.
[01:56:36.844 --> 01:56:38.005]  That's another great point.
[01:56:38.005 --> 01:56:39.486]  That's what this is all about.
[01:56:39.486 --> 01:56:41.848]  Chase, I appreciate the call.
[01:56:41.848 --> 01:56:43.189]  I'll say the cliché here.
[01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:44.811]  I'll see you next year.
[01:56:44.811 --> 01:56:47.993]  Let's talk to Julio in Illinois.
[01:56:47.993 --> 01:56:49.755]  Julio, go ahead.
[01:56:49.755 --> 01:56:52.657]  Alex Jones, freedom fighter or conspiracy expert.
[01:56:52.657 --> 01:56:57.701]  Happy New Year to you and the entire InfoWars crew and every freedom fighter tuning in today.
[01:56:58.431 --> 01:57:02.977]  Um, last night's conspiracy theory show, I know you may think it wasn't your favorite, but it...
[01:57:03.890 --> 01:57:12.997]  Everyone who is trying to spread the message of what's going on in the world, we try to explain to people about the Bilderberg Group and that there is a secret society that is controlling the Earth.
[01:57:12.997 --> 01:57:27.767]  So last night's show pretty much gave the groundwork for all the sterile people in this country to realize that yes, there are people other than Barack Hussein Obama or George Herbert Walker Bush or George Walker Bush that run this country.
[01:57:27.767 --> 01:57:31.470]  And with all the facts on the show, it's actually getting people aware of what's going on.
[01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:44.590]  Secondly, they talked about the Logan Act one more time, and I think in 2010, with all the fuel and all the ammunition that we have as info warriors, we need to go out and start pressing these issues, start going to the media and talking about the Logan Act.
[01:57:44.590 --> 01:57:45.150]  Yeah, that's a big issue.
[01:57:45.150 --> 01:57:47.992]  Hillary got a, I appreciate your call, Hilliard, great points.
[01:57:47.992 --> 01:57:57.880]  Hillary got a 300 and something thousand, I forget the exact amount, it was over a $300,000 fine for violating the Logan Act in the mid-1990s going to a Bilderberg.
[01:57:59.201 --> 01:58:06.943]  And then now she just goes in front of everybody, just like Rick Perry openly does to go discuss Texas politics and policy.
[01:58:06.943 --> 01:58:11.724]  And yeah, they're just setting the precedent to do illegal things out in the open.
[01:58:11.724 --> 01:58:13.145]  To just rub our faces in it.
[01:58:13.145 --> 01:58:14.925]  Great points, Julio.
[01:58:14.925 --> 01:58:25.288]  Alright, I'm gonna jam in Chris, Chief, Travis D., and others, and Webster Tarpley's coming up on a host of issues, looking into 2010, and then 2011, 2012, and beyond.
[01:58:29.264 --> 01:58:31.545]  I got a bunch of news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:58:31.545 --> 01:58:36.546]  I'm going to play clips from the Ventura Show and analyze that in the last hour.
[01:58:36.546 --> 01:58:43.488]  Hey, when I say it's not my favorite, I love it.
[01:58:43.488 --> 01:58:45.988]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.988 --> 01:58:48.289]  Be sure to visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.936 --> 01:58:55.478]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.478 --> 01:58:56.399]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.399 --> 01:58:59.821]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.821 --> 01:59:00.681]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.681 --> 01:59:05.564]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.564 --> 01:59:06.324]  It's true.
[01:59:06.324 --> 01:59:11.187]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.187 --> 01:59:12.007]  Number 3.
[01:59:12.007 --> 01:59:15.609]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.609 --> 01:59:19.311]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.511 --> 01:59:20.292]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.292 --> 01:59:23.054]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.054 --> 01:59:26.737]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.737 --> 01:59:27.537]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.537 --> 01:59:31.680]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.680 --> 01:59:36.444]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.724 --> 01:59:40.886]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.886 --> 01:59:42.687]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.687 --> 01:59:44.928]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:59:44.928 --> 01:59:47.229]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:59:47.229 --> 01:59:48.150]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:48.150 --> 01:59:49.410]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:59:49.410 --> 01:59:49.731]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.043 --> 02:00:08.804]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.804 --> 02:00:10.564]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.564 --> 02:00:12.145]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.145 --> 02:00:13.085]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.085 --> 02:00:17.887]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.887 --> 02:00:24.330]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.330 --> 02:00:32.393]  We'll be talking with Webster Charmpley about the latest underwear bombing, false flag event, and why this is being done.
[02:00:36.107 --> 02:00:39.688]  That's coming up.
[02:00:39.688 --> 02:00:44.129]  Because this isn't just to set up body scanners and train you on a police state.
[02:00:44.129 --> 02:00:46.830]  It's also about launching new wars.
[02:00:46.830 --> 02:00:48.230]  This is a big deal.
[02:00:48.230 --> 02:00:50.551]  This could be the start of World War III.
[02:00:50.551 --> 02:00:56.832]  That's what mainline analysts are saying, not just Webster Tarpley and myself.
[02:00:56.832 --> 02:01:00.453]  Right now, let's continue with your phone calls.
[02:01:00.453 --> 02:01:02.794]  Let's talk to Chief in Toronto, Canada.
[02:01:02.794 --> 02:01:03.574]  You're on the air, Chief.
[02:01:07.839 --> 02:01:19.567]  Yeah, you'll want to turn that computer or shortwave or AM and FM station you've got off and you'll want to pick the phone up and talk.
[02:01:19.567 --> 02:01:21.428]  Yeah, he's listening to a delay.
[02:01:21.428 --> 02:01:23.830]  Alright, we'll let Chief go.
[02:01:23.830 --> 02:01:25.231]  Chris in Florida.
[02:01:25.231 --> 02:01:26.031]  Chris, you're on the air.
[02:01:26.031 --> 02:01:27.352]  Go ahead.
[02:01:27.352 --> 02:01:29.734]  Hey Alex, it's an honor to talk to you.
[02:01:29.734 --> 02:01:31.715]  I'm a police officer in Florida.
[02:01:31.715 --> 02:01:34.457]  I've been doing it for about 17 years.
[02:01:34.457 --> 02:01:35.458]  I'm a little nervous now.
[02:01:35.458 --> 02:01:37.039]  I've never talked nationally before.
[02:01:38.021 --> 02:01:39.482]  Um, can you hear me?
[02:01:39.482 --> 02:01:40.682]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:40.682 --> 02:01:42.703]  Oh, okay.
[02:01:42.703 --> 02:01:44.303]  We got a little weird situation where I'm working.
[02:01:44.303 --> 02:01:45.743]  I don't want to give this CD out right now.
[02:01:45.743 --> 02:01:47.444]  I can't do that in private.
[02:01:47.444 --> 02:01:50.565]  But, uh, we got a group of guys here at my department that are on board.
[02:01:50.565 --> 02:01:52.986]  That's what we call it when they're awakened.
[02:01:52.986 --> 02:01:56.327]  And, uh, I became awakened back in, like, 96.
[02:01:56.327 --> 02:02:01.408]  I got home from work one night, flipped on a tube, and there was an infomercial about Bohemian Grove.
[02:02:01.408 --> 02:02:03.269]  And, uh, it blew my mind when I saw that.
[02:02:03.269 --> 02:02:06.310]  But anyway, this particular officer, two nights ago,
[02:02:07.048 --> 02:02:08.329]  Was about two o'clock in the morning.
[02:02:08.329 --> 02:02:10.851]  He's working a call for a missing girl.
[02:02:10.851 --> 02:02:13.233]  And they were setting up a perimeter in this area.
[02:02:13.233 --> 02:02:14.794]  He came up in this building.
[02:02:14.794 --> 02:02:17.576]  It's in like a small industrial area that we have.
[02:02:17.576 --> 02:02:21.639]  And in the woods was an unmarked car, like a police vehicle.
[02:02:21.639 --> 02:02:23.480]  And the guy that got out was a security guard.
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:24.381]  So he worked for Pinkerton.
[02:02:24.381 --> 02:02:28.044]  He was guarding the building that was in the area.
[02:02:28.044 --> 02:02:31.186]  And this officer, he's, you know, talking to this guy.
[02:02:31.186 --> 02:02:32.107]  It's two o'clock in the morning.
[02:02:32.808 --> 02:02:38.031]  And the guys who's building this, you know, it's owned by an Israeli corporation.
[02:02:38.031 --> 02:02:46.195]  And you remember in Fabled Enemies, you guys were talking about the routers and the cell phone things that they control and they can monitor cell phones and stuff like that?
[02:02:46.195 --> 02:02:48.436]  Yeah, one company controls like 95% of it.
[02:02:48.436 --> 02:02:50.097]  Well, I think I found one, man.
[02:02:50.097 --> 02:02:50.837]  And it's pretty interesting.
[02:02:50.837 --> 02:02:52.418]  This building is fortified.
[02:02:52.418 --> 02:02:53.378]  It's got cameras everywhere.
[02:02:53.378 --> 02:02:56.140]  They've got an armed security guard that works for Pinkerton.
[02:02:57.154 --> 02:02:59.276]  And, uh, he actually, the officer's smart.
[02:02:59.276 --> 02:03:00.196]  He's talking to this guy.
[02:03:00.196 --> 02:03:06.320]  So, and then when the guy says, hey, it's all about Israelis, they manufacture supposedly missile guidance systems.
[02:03:06.320 --> 02:03:07.501]  And the officer's working on it.
[02:03:07.501 --> 02:03:08.662]  He's like, well, hey, can I go in?
[02:03:08.662 --> 02:03:10.163]  You know, use your, your restroom and stuff.
[02:03:10.163 --> 02:03:11.924]  The guy's like, well, no, we're not supposed to put nobody in.
[02:03:11.924 --> 02:03:16.587]  But anyway, he goes in there and he comes out and the guy says, hey, you want to see something cool?
[02:03:16.587 --> 02:03:17.788]  And he brings him in this room.
[02:03:17.788 --> 02:03:20.670]  It's a giant mainframe computer.
[02:03:20.670 --> 02:03:23.212]  And, uh, as far as he could go, he said he couldn't get no farther.
[02:03:23.212 --> 02:03:25.093]  They had to wear special shoes to get around it and stuff.
[02:03:25.618 --> 02:03:29.801]  And I guess the other portion of the building, which you didn't see, was some manufacturing.
[02:03:29.801 --> 02:03:36.526]  And he said a couple days ago, his really big week showed up and actually a fire or something removed two of their guys from the inside.
[02:03:36.526 --> 02:03:38.528]  They're all mad and stuff.
[02:03:38.528 --> 02:03:39.809]  But I go over there.
[02:03:39.809 --> 02:03:41.670]  He calls me in the morning and tells me about this.
[02:03:41.670 --> 02:03:42.231]  I get to work.
[02:03:42.231 --> 02:03:43.732]  I go over and look at it.
[02:03:43.732 --> 02:03:46.714]  And sure enough, man, the place is completely surrounded by cameras.
[02:03:47.532 --> 02:03:50.614]  Um, they got some kind of weird antennas on the side of it.
[02:03:50.614 --> 02:03:51.195]  I got pictures.
[02:03:51.195 --> 02:03:51.995]  Oh yeah.
[02:03:51.995 --> 02:03:55.178]  Look, there are foreign government spy bases everywhere.
[02:03:55.178 --> 02:03:57.259]  And no one's got spy bases bigger than Israel.
[02:03:57.259 --> 02:03:59.181]  And they're allowed to spy.
[02:03:59.181 --> 02:04:00.682]  That's the difference.
[02:04:00.682 --> 02:04:06.306]  And yes, the Israeli government runs the caller ID, phone tracking systems.
[02:04:06.306 --> 02:04:09.228]  They also run the protection of nukes in the U.S.
[02:04:09.228 --> 02:04:11.409]  Our own Pentagon isn't allowed to do that.
[02:04:11.409 --> 02:04:16.113]  Because again, our government can go with a client state
[02:04:17.281 --> 02:04:17.521]  I don't know.
[02:04:34.938 --> 02:04:40.200]  But then Israel gets to be on the Pentagon-Northcom Homeland Security System.
[02:04:40.200 --> 02:04:40.960]  Stay there.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:45.882]  I want you to be able to finish up on the other side of this break, Chris, in Florida.
[02:04:45.882 --> 02:04:48.023]  Then we're going to Webster, Griffin, Tarpley.
[02:04:48.023 --> 02:04:57.326]  We're also going live at PrisonPlanet.TV for the last two hours of this radio broadcast, last show of the year.
[02:04:57.326 --> 02:05:00.687]  We'll also continue with your calls, Travis, Dee, Tom, David and others.
[02:05:01.755 --> 02:05:04.757]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:05:04.757 --> 02:05:10.082]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:05:10.082 --> 02:05:12.143]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:05:12.143 --> 02:05:17.147]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:05:17.147 --> 02:05:18.048]  How much do you want?
[02:05:18.308 --> 02:05:19.429]  When do you want it?
[02:05:19.429 --> 02:05:21.310]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:05:21.310 --> 02:05:22.391]  When will you need it?
[02:05:22.391 --> 02:05:24.592]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:05:24.592 --> 02:05:25.933]  Will there be any food?
[02:05:25.933 --> 02:05:27.474]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:05:27.474 --> 02:05:32.738]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:05:32.738 --> 02:05:36.320]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:05:36.320 --> 02:05:39.783]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:05:40.123 --> 02:05:41.345]  How much will you need?
[02:05:41.345 --> 02:05:42.266]  We don't know.
[02:05:42.266 --> 02:05:43.367]  How much do you want?
[02:05:43.367 --> 02:05:44.288]  All you can get.
[02:05:44.288 --> 02:05:45.389]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:05:45.389 --> 02:05:48.433]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:05:48.433 --> 02:05:50.215]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:05:50.215 --> 02:05:51.136]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:06.027]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[02:06:06.027 --> 02:06:10.573]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[02:06:10.573 --> 02:06:12.856]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[02:06:12.856 --> 02:06:14.478]  You don't have to cooperate.
[02:06:14.478 --> 02:06:15.500]  There is a solution.
[02:06:15.720 --> 02:06:24.147]  Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[02:07:07.589 --> 02:07:08.869]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[02:07:08.869 --> 02:07:09.690]  It's very real.
[02:07:09.690 --> 02:07:11.931]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[02:07:11.931 --> 02:07:13.571]  And it's available right now to you.

[02:07:53.229 --> 02:08:01.852]  Or visit a Coloblue on the web at www.ecoloble.com today.
[02:08:01.852 --> 02:08:07.334]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:11.172 --> 02:08:27.045]  You know, it doesn't mean that Tala Tech, Tala-Com is doing anything wrong, but it is important to keep our eyes on foreign-owned corporate governments and groups, whether it be the Chinese, the Israelis, anybody.
[02:08:27.045 --> 02:08:35.732]  And I did look up Tala-Tech, and it's leaders in design, development, production of military, industrial, commercial communications equipment.
[02:08:37.063 --> 02:08:42.704]  And that's just another example of how our country, our military, everything is dependent on foreign lands.
[02:08:42.704 --> 02:08:45.645]  The opposite of what George Washington said we should do.
[02:08:45.645 --> 02:08:50.406]  But I was asking the police officer calling in from Florida.
[02:08:50.406 --> 02:08:51.766]  A lot of the officers are waking up.
[02:08:51.766 --> 02:08:56.187]  He told me off-air a lot of the people that have been in a while are and are concerned.
[02:08:56.187 --> 02:08:58.928]  And he was giving me some of the terms they have for the people that aren't awake.
[02:08:59.828 --> 02:09:07.834]  So, anything else you want to add about the mindset of the police you work with, the awakening that's happening, Chris, from Florida?
[02:09:07.834 --> 02:09:17.822]  Well, I think police in general, you know, they're... I will tell you this, the guys that are older that have been doing this, maybe 10 years and longer, are a lot more mindset than the ones that are just coming in.
[02:09:17.822 --> 02:09:20.584]  The ones that come in, I'm going to have to be honest with you, man, they're stupid.
[02:09:20.584 --> 02:09:21.905]  They don't know what's going on.
[02:09:21.905 --> 02:09:23.026]  They hire them right out of college.
[02:09:23.026 --> 02:09:25.908]  They don't even know how they graduated college, you know, and stuff.
[02:09:25.908 --> 02:09:27.349]  They can't even function on the street.
[02:09:28.260 --> 02:09:35.861]  And the guys, you can think for themselves, are the ones that are, you know, they're not going to go along on any kind of programs that are just going to be against our civil rights.
[02:09:35.861 --> 02:09:44.643]  But, uh, I just found it interesting that this company is owned by the Israelis, and they're supposedly manufacturing a part of the building, missile guidance systems.
[02:09:44.643 --> 02:09:54.305]  You know, and another thing, the security guard, he says the people they bring in to work and manufacture some of the spook items are making them call them eggheads, and they're only allowed in portions of the building.
[02:09:54.821 --> 02:09:58.144]  So the issue is, the police officer you talked to, and you've now checked the area out, he got a bad feeling.
[02:09:58.144 --> 02:10:01.426]  What I'm getting is, it had the feeling of a spook compound.
[02:10:21.482 --> 02:10:22.962]  Right, and this officer is on board.
[02:10:22.962 --> 02:10:26.603]  We've been discussing this stuff for, I don't know, two or three years now.
[02:10:26.603 --> 02:10:30.724]  And, uh, he's very well aware... On board, again, means awake to what's going on.
[02:10:30.724 --> 02:10:31.244]  Yeah.
[02:10:31.244 --> 02:10:32.904]  Yeah, it's just a little term we made up.
[02:10:32.904 --> 02:10:34.425]  And that's a good term.
[02:10:34.425 --> 02:10:37.825]  And then what do you call the police that love the system?
[02:10:37.825 --> 02:10:39.326]  Uh, bootlickers.
[02:10:39.326 --> 02:10:42.926]  I like to describe them as guys that live on their knees instead of on their feet.
[02:10:42.926 --> 02:10:45.747]  You know, and they don't do anything the administration wants.
[02:10:46.536 --> 02:10:47.497]  Sure, everywhere has bootleggers.
[02:11:10.346 --> 02:11:13.908]  Building and what's going on there is very important in the United States.
[02:11:13.908 --> 02:11:17.190]  He said during the economic collapse, Tosh, you wouldn't have to worry about it.
[02:11:17.190 --> 02:11:18.871]  They would try to keep it up.
[02:11:18.871 --> 02:11:20.192]  And, I mean, I really don't know what it is.
[02:11:20.192 --> 02:11:23.994]  It definitely looks like some kind of communications receiving facility.
[02:11:23.994 --> 02:11:29.958]  And, you know, the way they have the air ducts and the air conditioners, they definitely were trying to cool something down.
[02:11:29.958 --> 02:11:32.059]  And they probably did have a manufacturing facility in there.
[02:11:32.059 --> 02:11:34.581]  The whole place, all the windows are tinted out.
[02:11:34.581 --> 02:11:39.004]  The few windows that they have, everything else was, there was just, you know, there was no way to look inside.
[02:11:40.347 --> 02:11:41.668]  I got pictures, I can send them to you.
[02:11:41.668 --> 02:11:43.969]  Alright, keep up the fight man.
[02:11:59.753 --> 02:12:11.497]  But listen, the Pentagon spends more money in 2009, the numbers just came in, saw this in the news last week, than all 50 states combined, all their budgets.
[02:12:11.497 --> 02:12:19.680]  The banks have stolen, latest Bloomberg numbers are out, 27 plus trillion.
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:27.142]  So we now have the numbers, and more may come in later, it always comes in a few months late, but so far, 27 plus trillion.
[02:12:30.939 --> 02:12:31.880]  I forget the points.
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:36.163]  It was $23.7 trillion and then $4.5 trillion.
[02:12:36.163 --> 02:12:38.666]  It's over $27 trillion.
[02:12:38.666 --> 02:12:41.408]  The point is that it's just massive.
[02:12:45.447 --> 02:12:49.568]  I mean, it's numbers you can't even get your mind around.
[02:12:49.568 --> 02:12:51.649]  We're being robbed right now.
[02:12:51.649 --> 02:13:01.092]  Okay, for the rest of the hour, maybe a little bit in the next hour, we're very honored to have Webster Griffin Tarpley, who is a doctorate in history.
[02:13:01.092 --> 02:13:03.333]  He also is a degreed economist.
[02:13:04.366 --> 02:13:08.149]  And the author of the unauthorized biography of George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:13:08.149 --> 02:13:12.152]  Two unauthorized biographies of Barack Obama.
[02:13:12.152 --> 02:13:16.055]  Well, one's an unauthorized biography and the other's an analysis.
[02:13:16.055 --> 02:13:18.957]  And he joins us now to talk about what happened in 2009, what's coming up in 2010.
[02:13:18.957 --> 02:13:19.657]  But also, the underwear bomber.
[02:13:26.918 --> 02:13:35.961]  And the FBI now being caught lying, saying they didn't detain anybody else, they didn't find a bomb, saying no one brought this guy onto the plane.
[02:13:35.961 --> 02:13:39.382]  Now that's been confirmed that someone did, but they won't say who.
[02:13:39.382 --> 02:13:44.364]  They won't release the videotapes from Amsterdam.
[02:13:44.364 --> 02:13:48.325]  How we saw the preconditioning last month that Yemen had to be hit.
[02:13:48.325 --> 02:13:51.026]  Now this happens, oh it came out of Yemen, we gotta hit Yemen.
[02:13:52.651 --> 02:13:56.913]  The whole geopolitical strategy, what this signals.
[02:13:56.913 --> 02:14:00.015]  We knew that Obama would start launching false flags.
[02:14:00.015 --> 02:14:05.138]  I had predicted aircraft bombings, attempted bombings, flu hype in January.
[02:14:05.138 --> 02:14:06.219]  I was proven right.
[02:14:06.219 --> 02:14:07.840]  That's all the preconditioning.
[02:14:07.840 --> 02:14:13.883]  But Tarpley is, again, a real expert on this, so we'll get his predictions and his view on what's happening.
[02:14:13.883 --> 02:14:18.986]  And then a little bit into the next hour, I want to get his take on, well, the health care.
[02:14:19.326 --> 02:14:20.446]  Even the liberals are waking up.
[02:14:20.446 --> 02:14:23.788]  This is a giant rip-off to the insurance companies.
[02:14:23.788 --> 02:14:26.469]  Higher taxes, less benefits.
[02:14:26.469 --> 02:14:29.910]  Webster Tarpley, it's good to have you here as we close out 2009.
[02:14:29.910 --> 02:14:32.731]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:14:32.731 --> 02:14:35.512]  Happy New Year to you and to all the listeners.
[02:14:35.512 --> 02:14:42.014]  What did you think of that police officer calling in talking about a intelligence nest?
[02:14:42.014 --> 02:14:45.856]  Yeah, I guess, I think that's Converse Infosystems.
[02:14:45.856 --> 02:14:46.716]  Isn't that one of them?
[02:14:47.638 --> 02:14:48.259]  Yes.
[02:14:48.259 --> 02:14:54.542]  Anyway, I think we've written that up in the 9-11 that they were able to monitor most U.S.
[02:14:54.542 --> 02:14:57.804]  telephone conversations.
[02:14:57.804 --> 02:15:06.270]  And now we learn a month ago that all of the text messages, phone messages, everything was just recorded from 9-11 and now they're releasing it!
[02:15:06.270 --> 02:15:10.292]  The government and its private subsidiaries are just recording everything!
[02:15:10.292 --> 02:15:11.293]  We're so free, Webster!
[02:15:12.498 --> 02:15:15.380]  Well, that's across the National Security Agency.
[02:15:15.380 --> 02:15:23.307]  But maybe, just to take a look now at the world strategic picture, because I think we have, I think a very ominous pattern.
[02:15:23.307 --> 02:15:27.891]  I look for 2010 to be a very tempestuous time.
[02:15:27.891 --> 02:15:33.656]  But I mean, let's start with the kickoff, the underwear bomber, and then let's take your time, go into all of it.
[02:15:34.170 --> 02:15:44.622]  All right, well, I think it's obvious, I'm sure it's obvious to you, this is a controlled Patsy, and we have this same pattern that we've seen again and again.
[02:15:44.622 --> 02:15:49.268]  We have these individuals that have very limited mental equipment.
[02:15:49.788 --> 02:15:52.589]  But nevertheless, they're able to work miracles.
[02:15:52.589 --> 02:15:55.511]  They can do things that a normal person would never be able to do.
[02:15:55.511 --> 02:16:01.433]  You'd be arrested, you'd be questioned, you'd be searched, you'd be stopped in some way, rounded up.
[02:16:01.433 --> 02:16:11.418]  But no, in this case we have Omar Farouk Moutalab, the son of this rich, elitist, oligarch banker from
[02:16:11.938 --> 02:16:15.762]  From Nigeria, and he can do all these amazing things.
[02:16:15.762 --> 02:16:18.044]  His own father goes to the U.S.
[02:16:18.044 --> 02:16:27.032]  Embassy in Lagos, Nigeria, denounces him as a possible terrorist, somebody who was probably at a camp of some kind in Yemen.
[02:16:27.032 --> 02:16:33.298]  And this is shared by the State Department and the CIA right off the bat, and that seems to be sometime in about mid-November.
[02:16:34.056 --> 02:16:38.039]  And nevertheless, that's not enough to have his visa taken away.
[02:16:38.039 --> 02:16:38.900]  He's got a U.S.
[02:16:38.900 --> 02:16:41.863]  multiple-entry visa, which he's allowed to keep.
[02:16:41.863 --> 02:16:50.190]  And of course, you know, you can have a stamp in the passport, but if they change it in the computer, then when you try to... And he's traveling all over Italy, all over Africa.
[02:16:50.190 --> 02:16:51.971]  He's in countries illegally.
[02:16:51.971 --> 02:16:53.192]  He gets out of countries.
[02:16:53.192 --> 02:16:54.653]  He's disheveled.
[02:16:54.653 --> 02:16:56.375]  Looks like he's drugged.
[02:16:56.895 --> 02:16:57.915]  Stumbling around?
[02:16:57.915 --> 02:16:59.356]  I mean, this is classic.
[02:16:59.356 --> 02:17:04.477]  Right, so he's able then to basically have no effect.
[02:17:04.477 --> 02:17:10.619]  He doesn't get on any serious list for scrutiny or special search.
[02:17:10.619 --> 02:17:13.420]  And he's then able to buy a ticket, a one-way ticket from
[02:17:14.421 --> 02:17:14.922]  I think so.
[02:17:33.679 --> 02:17:38.201]  And then we have this famous story of the well-dressed Indian who accompanies him.
[02:17:38.201 --> 02:17:41.382]  And to me, this suggests that he is a mental deficient.
[02:17:41.382 --> 02:17:43.342]  He's in the same class with Richard Reed.
[02:17:43.342 --> 02:17:47.083]  He's mentally retarded in some way.
[02:17:47.083 --> 02:17:56.266]  And, of course, he could get a degree at University College London with the help of MI5, or maybe his father made a large contribution to University College London.
[02:17:56.266 --> 02:17:57.587]  That stuff happens all the time.
[02:17:58.451 --> 02:18:13.064]  Uh, so he's able then to, uh, to, uh, get into the, uh, he gets from one plane to another thanks to this patsy minder, a patsy chaperone or patsy monitor, the rich, well-dressed Indian who makes an odd couple with him.
[02:18:13.064 --> 02:18:16.867]  And that guy delivers him to the gate and says that he doesn't have a passport.
[02:18:16.867 --> 02:18:19.569]  And I'd be interested to see, is there a passport?
[02:18:19.569 --> 02:18:21.051]  Won't the FBI please show us?
[02:18:22.172 --> 02:18:36.462]  The FBI has been caught lying, saying that there was no one videotaping on the plane, no one else was pulled off at Customs in Detroit, now they've had to go back and admit they were lying, they won't release the videos from
[02:18:38.533 --> 02:18:44.741]  Oh yes, I think it's beyond suspicious.
[02:18:44.741 --> 02:18:46.664]  It's a clear case of a patsy.
[02:18:46.664 --> 02:18:48.726]  So he's a controlled asset.
[02:18:48.726 --> 02:18:52.011]  And of course it's not a matter of failure to connect the dots.
[02:18:52.011 --> 02:18:53.993]  We're hearing all about the unconnected dots.
[02:18:53.993 --> 02:18:54.134]  No.
[02:18:54.714 --> 02:18:57.055]  This is the desired outcome.
[02:18:57.055 --> 02:18:58.636]  We're dealing with the rogue network.
[02:18:58.636 --> 02:19:08.159]  We're dealing with the same people that brought you, again, the Gulf of Tonkin incident, the Kennedy assassination, Iran-Contra 9-11.
[02:19:08.159 --> 02:19:09.540]  Nobody's ever laid a glove on them.
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:11.761]  And the rogue network can't help themselves.
[02:19:11.761 --> 02:19:13.523]  We're going to break, we're going to come back and cover it.
[02:19:13.523 --> 02:19:29.756]  They can't help themselves as they pre-positioned troops in Yemen the last two months, as they begin the hype a week ago that it's got to be hit, and then right on time the Patsy bombing comes, and then right on time they hype it like it's the end of the world throughout the weekend.
[02:19:31.397 --> 02:19:38.000]  So when we come back, finish up with the Rogue Network and what this signifies, the new operations they're launching.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.281]  Dr. Webster Tarpeley is our guest.
[02:19:40.281 --> 02:19:44.302]  By the way, we sell all four of his books that are in print.
[02:19:44.302 --> 02:19:48.284]  He's got a bunch of other books on European history and the rest of it you can find.
[02:19:48.284 --> 02:19:49.685]  Scholarly treatises.
[02:19:49.685 --> 02:19:52.886]  Thank you, Webster, for the one you sent me in French for my wife.
[02:19:52.886 --> 02:19:57.248]  Well, there's a part of it's in English if you just take a look.
[02:19:57.248 --> 02:19:59.589]  I saw the part from you, yes, but she reads French, so that's good.
[02:19:59.589 --> 02:20:00.109]  We'll be right back.
[02:20:10.811 --> 02:20:11.331]  We're good to go!

[02:21:02.626 --> 02:21:06.652]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:21:06.652 --> 02:21:09.896]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:21:09.896 --> 02:21:11.318]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:14.701]  We're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:21:14.701 --> 02:21:21.083]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:21:21.083 --> 02:21:26.625]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:21:26.625 --> 02:21:36.248]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:21:36.368 --> 02:21:38.709]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:21:38.709 --> 02:21:40.310]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:21:40.310 --> 02:21:42.771]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:21:42.771 --> 02:21:44.892]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:21:44.892 --> 02:21:50.034]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:21:50.034 --> 02:21:59.157]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:22:01.024 --> 02:22:05.148]  Are you tired of out-of-control, irresponsible, federal deficit spending?
[02:22:05.148 --> 02:22:09.411]  Increasing the money supply without increasing productive output leads to inflation.
[02:22:09.411 --> 02:22:10.993]  You get less for your money.
[02:22:10.993 --> 02:22:16.878]  If you want to protect the buying power of dollars for your future, then call Peter May at MIDAS Resources.
[02:22:16.878 --> 02:22:16.918]  800-687-8000.
[02:22:18.419 --> 02:22:19.119]  I think so.
[02:22:41.886 --> 02:22:42.126]  We're good.
[02:23:01.204 --> 02:23:03.646]  You have a mortgage and a load of other debt.
[02:23:03.646 --> 02:23:05.528]  Wouldn't it be great if it all just went away?
[02:23:05.528 --> 02:23:07.390]  No More Mortgage can change your life.
[02:23:07.390 --> 02:23:08.832]  We paid off all of our bills.
[02:23:08.832 --> 02:23:11.614]  All your debt, including your mortgage, in as little as nine years.
[02:23:11.614 --> 02:23:17.260]  With No More Mortgage, we will have saved over $313,000 in interest payments.
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:18.941]  Even have more money left over each month?
[02:23:18.941 --> 02:23:21.544]  It lowered our monthly payments by a little over $500.
[02:23:21.544 --> 02:23:22.004]  No More Mortgage.
[02:23:24.046 --> 02:23:25.327]  Where have they been all of our life?
[02:23:25.327 --> 02:23:27.829]  If you knew about something like that, you'd want to tell everybody.
[02:23:27.829 --> 02:23:31.712]  Whenever I have a friend or someone that needs this service, I give them the number.
[02:23:31.712 --> 02:23:33.874]  I'm Larry Ruff, president of No More Mortgage.

[02:23:49.306 --> 02:23:49.606]  Call the number.

[02:23:54.790 --> 02:23:54.850]  800-578-6279.
[02:23:54.850 --> 02:24:00.195]  Alright, I got a lot of stuff I want to talk about with Webster Tarpley and take your phone calls.
[02:24:00.195 --> 02:24:04.720]  The final radio show of 2009.
[02:24:04.720 --> 02:24:05.440]  2009 has a very long beard.
[02:24:05.440 --> 02:24:06.061]  He's very old.
[02:24:18.027 --> 02:24:23.209]  A new year, a babe will be dumped out into the world at midnight tonight in your time zone.
[02:24:23.209 --> 02:24:26.391]  Okay, Webster, without me interrupting, there's just so much evidence.
[02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:37.856]  You're talking about rogue networks, all the fingerprints, the classic MO, the signature, the wavelength, the smell, the red-handedness, then the media hype, the motive, the new initiative.
[02:24:37.856 --> 02:24:40.257]  Oh, we've all got to have body scanners.
[02:24:40.257 --> 02:24:44.079]  We've all, I mean, just so many initiatives they're launching with this.
[02:24:44.719 --> 02:24:47.023]  It's just like with the flu inoculations.
[02:24:47.023 --> 02:24:51.550]  We saw that hype and now we have the memos that it was all hype.
[02:24:51.550 --> 02:24:53.072]  Clearly a staged event.
[02:24:53.072 --> 02:24:54.174]  What is the goal?
[02:24:54.174 --> 02:24:54.615]  Continue.
[02:24:55.373 --> 02:25:02.436]  Well, the rogue network, of course, is a private network that cuts across the various agencies and executive departments of the U.S.
[02:25:02.436 --> 02:25:04.116]  and other governments.
[02:25:04.116 --> 02:25:06.997]  The big British role is quite big.
[02:25:06.997 --> 02:25:12.720]  So it's the City of London and Wall Street controlling this network with their ideas of strategy.
[02:25:12.720 --> 02:25:15.121]  Let me just point out a couple of other things here.
[02:25:15.121 --> 02:25:21.063]  We're told that this alleged bomber, right, the Knicker bomber, whatever they call him,
[02:25:21.804 --> 02:25:26.288]  Uh, he was in contact with this character, Al-Laki, in Yemen.
[02:25:26.288 --> 02:25:31.054]  And of course, this Al-Laki, I call him Al-Laki the CIA lackey.
[02:25:31.054 --> 02:25:32.235]  Al-Laki the lackey.
[02:25:32.235 --> 02:25:34.237]  And remember, he's a CIA lackey.
[02:25:34.237 --> 02:25:36.520]  He's a double agent, a triple agent, if you want.
[02:25:37.020 --> 02:25:37.661]  He's lying!
[02:25:56.834 --> 02:26:07.561]  Like Hal Turner was to the white supremacist who I said for a decade was FBI and now it's Chicago Tribune Associated Press that he's FBI deep cover controlling everything.
[02:26:07.561 --> 02:26:10.063]  I mean, obviously he was FBI.
[02:26:10.063 --> 02:26:11.504]  Same thing with a Lockheed.
[02:26:11.504 --> 02:26:12.465]  Right, exactly.
[02:26:12.465 --> 02:26:15.186]  So this guy, he's a U.S.
[02:26:15.186 --> 02:26:18.228]  agent under whatever layers of garb that he's got.
[02:26:18.228 --> 02:26:25.213]  The other thing is, how was this young patsy Omar Farouk Muttalib, how was he radicalized?
[02:26:25.213 --> 02:26:26.054]  And I think we're getting
[02:26:26.634 --> 02:26:34.561]  Some pretty good indications that it's this Brixton Mosque, Finsbury Mosque, Axis in London, the school for patsies, the British patsies.
[02:26:34.561 --> 02:26:41.347]  Which by the way, six months ago, I remember it, you predicted we'd see plane bombings out of that mosque.
[02:26:42.130 --> 02:26:45.313]  Yeah, well, again, this is not so hard to do.
[02:26:45.313 --> 02:26:46.915]  Remember Richard Reid?
[02:26:46.915 --> 02:26:55.363]  Richard Reid, mentally retarded vagrant who was sleeping on the floor of Brixton Mosque, I think, or Finsbury, one of the others, one of the other.
[02:26:55.363 --> 02:27:01.469]  He was given the same PETN explosive by somebody, so that's what this Omar Farouk
[02:27:02.029 --> 02:27:02.550]  We're good to go.
[02:27:17.051 --> 02:27:20.214]  Then this gets us into the big picture.
[02:27:20.214 --> 02:27:26.619]  Saudi Arabia is, of course, a crucial pillar of the Anglo-American world empire.
[02:27:26.619 --> 02:27:38.969]  And we've seen, in the course of this year, strong, what we can call centripetal tendencies, in other words, desire by various people in Saudi Arabia to get out from under this U.S.
[02:27:38.969 --> 02:27:39.949]  protectorate.
[02:27:39.949 --> 02:27:44.433]  And the form that it took around August, I think, was Prince Bandar, of all people.
[02:27:44.433 --> 02:27:45.454]  Bandar Bush, yes.
[02:27:46.054 --> 02:28:03.707]  Changing his strategic orientation and becoming the great friend of Putin and Russia, trying to bring in Russia, and I would think China, to try to redress the balance and gain some national independence for Saudi Arabia, not to be tied to the U.S., especially at a time when the U.S.
[02:28:03.707 --> 02:28:09.951]  is undoubtedly preparing some kind of a people power coup or velvet revolution inside Saudi Arabia.
[02:28:10.211 --> 02:28:11.693]  And so where's Bandar?
[02:28:11.693 --> 02:28:13.114]  Oh, from the Godfather.
[02:28:13.114 --> 02:28:14.896]  You won't see him no more.
[02:28:14.896 --> 02:28:16.698]  He's now been disappeared.
[02:28:16.698 --> 02:28:22.664]  He's under house arrest, or maybe you know more, but I haven't seen anything about him since about August.
[02:28:22.664 --> 02:28:30.472]  But there is a big fight about the royal succession, and that is very prominent in Middle East news organs.
[02:28:30.472 --> 02:28:31.293]  Now, Yemen.
[02:28:32.093 --> 02:28:36.618]  The short thing on Yemen is this is a very, very poor country.
[02:28:36.618 --> 02:28:39.440]  And they had a whole colonial history with the British, right?
[02:28:39.440 --> 02:28:48.228]  Aden, back in the 60s, was a big colonial, anti-British guerrilla warfare going on.
[02:28:48.228 --> 02:28:49.750]  Right now, though, it's a government
[02:28:50.430 --> 02:28:55.673]  That is Sunni in its composition and allied to Saudi Arabia.
[02:28:55.673 --> 02:29:01.016]  So that's the central government in Sana'a under President Saleh of Yemen.
[02:29:01.016 --> 02:29:03.037]  But there is this rebellion going.
[02:29:03.037 --> 02:29:07.160]  The Houthi rebels who are Shiites and they are backed by
[02:29:08.027 --> 02:29:09.128]  Uh, Iran.
[02:29:09.128 --> 02:29:10.488]  And we've had the U.S.
[02:29:10.488 --> 02:29:19.171]  bombing this twice in the past month or so, fairly large-scale stuff, either with these drones or with warplanes.
[02:29:19.171 --> 02:29:20.292]  Now, here's the big thing.
[02:29:21.027 --> 02:29:21.928]  The U.S.
[02:29:21.928 --> 02:29:24.749]  is busily building up Al-Qaeda.
[02:29:24.749 --> 02:29:29.292]  Al-Qaeda, the CIA Muslim Legion, is being actively built up by the U.S.
[02:29:29.292 --> 02:29:39.618]  inside Yemen to make that civil war much worse and to get the Saudis and the Iranians at each other's throats, maybe at war, in Yemen.
[02:29:39.618 --> 02:29:47.183]  Alright, let's talk about where you think that's going, the wider geopolitical reasons for this, in the grand strategy.
[02:29:47.183 --> 02:29:50.425]  Let's go into the mind of Zbigniew Brzezinski when we get back.
[02:29:51.877 --> 02:29:55.785]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.785 --> 02:29:58.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.072 --> 02:30:05.615]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.615 --> 02:30:06.536]  Number one.
[02:30:06.536 --> 02:30:09.959]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.959 --> 02:30:10.819]  Number two.
[02:30:10.819 --> 02:30:15.703]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.703 --> 02:30:16.464]  It's true.
[02:30:16.464 --> 02:30:21.327]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:30:21.327 --> 02:30:21.788]  Number three.
[02:30:22.128 --> 02:30:25.730]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:30.433]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:30:30.433 --> 02:30:33.195]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:30:33.195 --> 02:30:37.677]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:30:37.677 --> 02:30:41.820]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.820 --> 02:30:46.583]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:30:46.863 --> 02:30:51.025]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:51.025 --> 02:30:52.826]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:30:52.826 --> 02:30:55.068]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[02:30:55.068 --> 02:30:57.409]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:31:02.810 --> 02:31:06.771]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:06.771 --> 02:31:15.634]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:31:15.634 --> 02:31:20.255]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:31:20.255 --> 02:31:31.078]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:31:31.718 --> 02:31:41.221]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:41.221 --> 02:31:46.662]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:31:46.662 --> 02:31:54.144]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:31:54.144 --> 02:31:56.885]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:32:02.068 --> 02:32:06.089]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:32:06.089 --> 02:32:09.310]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:32:09.310 --> 02:32:14.111]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:32:14.111 --> 02:32:20.513]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:32:20.513 --> 02:32:22.754]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:32:23.294 --> 02:32:23.594]  Tim Geithner?
[02:32:23.594 --> 02:32:24.115]  Bernanke?
[02:32:24.115 --> 02:32:24.915]  They're arsonists!
[02:32:24.915 --> 02:32:26.056]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:32:26.056 --> 02:32:28.297]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:32:42.185 --> 02:32:49.468]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:32:49.468 --> 02:32:58.592]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:33:14.004 --> 02:33:25.108]  We're getting ready to close out the year.
[02:33:25.108 --> 02:33:27.009]  It's my last live transmission.
[02:33:27.009 --> 02:33:30.370]  It's December 31st, 2009 on this Thursday edition.
[02:33:30.370 --> 02:33:31.870]  Webster Tarpley is our guest.
[02:33:31.870 --> 02:33:32.471]  You know, we had
[02:33:34.448 --> 02:33:40.233]  Kurt Haskell back on, one of the eyewitnesses, and other eyewitnesses are confirming another man was pulled off the plane.
[02:33:40.233 --> 02:33:42.235]  Bob-sniffing dogs went up to it.
[02:33:42.235 --> 02:33:43.736]  The FBI said, we got to get you out of here.
[02:33:43.736 --> 02:33:44.897]  There may be a bomb.
[02:33:44.897 --> 02:33:46.999]  Then they lied and said that it never happened.
[02:33:46.999 --> 02:33:52.984]  Here's the headline from MichiganLive.com, the big news site in Michigan.
[02:33:52.984 --> 02:33:55.927]  Flight 253 out, eyewitness.
[02:33:55.927 --> 02:33:58.329]  Authorities are lying about terror attack.
[02:34:00.319 --> 02:34:03.324]  And of course, people accuse us of sensationalism.
[02:34:03.324 --> 02:34:06.408]  That's what the headline says for mainstream news.
[02:34:06.408 --> 02:34:12.778]  The article Paul Watson wrote about it had a very, very tame headline.
[02:34:12.778 --> 02:34:14.100]  In fact, I have it here in my stack.
[02:34:15.409 --> 02:34:19.792]  But we have eyewitnesses saying this is open lying going on.
[02:34:19.792 --> 02:34:24.134]  And that's the kind of headlines we need at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:34:24.134 --> 02:34:33.460]  The establishment tries to intimidate alternative news people into watering down what we say, watering down what we do, into mediating facts.
[02:34:33.460 --> 02:34:34.440]  Facts are facts.
[02:34:34.440 --> 02:34:36.682]  You can have your own opinions, but you can't have your own facts.
[02:34:37.705 --> 02:34:46.068]  And Watson and everybody are doing a great job, it's just that the mainstream media realizes the bombshell nature of those interviews we did the last few days.
[02:34:46.068 --> 02:34:47.929]  I don't think we do.
[02:34:47.929 --> 02:34:50.269]  I don't think the listeners do.
[02:34:50.269 --> 02:34:55.011]  I don't think people understand this is really a staged event in front of us with a patsy.
[02:34:55.011 --> 02:34:57.132]  There's no other way to see it.
[02:34:57.132 --> 02:35:02.834]  And I don't think people realize just how big this is, what's being kicked off.
[02:35:04.531 --> 02:35:10.735]  I don't think people realize just how serious this is, what's being set off, what's being launched.
[02:35:10.735 --> 02:35:15.357]  Webster Tarpley breaking down the larger geopolitical ramifications.
[02:35:15.357 --> 02:35:18.899]  A lot of analysts saying this could be the beginning of World War III.
[02:35:18.899 --> 02:35:19.500]  Open talk.
[02:35:20.200 --> 02:35:21.301]  Hopefully it's not the case.
[02:35:21.301 --> 02:35:24.883]  More saber-rattling about striking Iran.
[02:35:24.883 --> 02:35:27.405]  Israel saying they may strike Iran.
[02:35:27.405 --> 02:35:29.246]  Iran saying they'll strike back.
[02:35:29.246 --> 02:35:30.427]  What that will do.
[02:35:30.427 --> 02:35:33.089]  What do you think the globalists are testing?
[02:35:33.089 --> 02:35:37.052]  What are the Anglo-American establishment doing right now?
[02:35:37.052 --> 02:35:38.313]  Where do you see this going?
[02:35:38.313 --> 02:35:44.177]  This talk about going into Africa, Somalia, Sudan, not just Aden and Yemen.
[02:35:45.080 --> 02:35:49.622]  Well, first of all, I would say the use of Yemen.
[02:35:49.622 --> 02:35:55.505]  Yemen is the place where you play Saudi Arabia against Iran, and I think this is what has changed compared to Bush.
[02:35:55.505 --> 02:36:02.068]  In other words, the Obama administration knows that they're too weak to do these attacks, so they've got to get other people to do them.
[02:36:02.068 --> 02:36:03.709]  They want to attack Pakistan?
[02:36:03.709 --> 02:36:05.690]  They know they can't attack Pakistan.
[02:36:05.690 --> 02:36:11.093]  They've got to use Pashtunistan and Balochistan and get a rebellion going inside Pakistan.
[02:36:12.373 --> 02:36:14.075]  It's the civil war going on.
[02:36:14.075 --> 02:36:19.200]  The U.S., before the eyes of the world, is massively building up Al-Qaeda.
[02:36:19.200 --> 02:36:23.344]  And the way they're doing it is by transferring people from Guantanamo, right?
[02:36:23.344 --> 02:36:30.170]  It's now all over the news that the number two man of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, a complete U.S.
[02:36:30.170 --> 02:36:34.154]  creation, is actually somebody who was in Guantanamo.
[02:36:34.154 --> 02:36:37.096]  And we can see from Iranian press TV
[02:36:37.975 --> 02:36:40.517]  That they accused the U.S.
[02:36:40.517 --> 02:36:50.646]  of transferring terrorist fighters from all over, from Bagram in Afghanistan, from all the prisons and all the black sites that they have across the Middle East.
[02:36:50.646 --> 02:37:00.033]  Those are now being massed in Yemen to create an al-Qaeda striking force inside Yemen that can be used to make this civil war worse, right?
[02:37:00.874 --> 02:37:10.917]  Tack back and forth, you know, fighting one, fighting another, setting off bombs, getting the Saudis to do more air attacks, getting the Iranians embroiled more.
[02:37:10.917 --> 02:37:23.101]  So this is going on before the eyes of the world, and if you read carefully in the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post, you can see that they're saying it's probably not a good idea to transfer so many al-Qaeda people from Guantanamo back into Yemen.
[02:37:23.101 --> 02:37:29.543]  But that is exactly the goal, and this is not an unintended consequence, it is the intended consequence.
[02:37:30.403 --> 02:37:33.765]  I do not see an attack on Iran, and I'll tell you why.
[02:37:33.765 --> 02:37:40.828]  The approach to Iran is, essentially what I've been saying, is to get Iran fighting Saudi Arabia.
[02:37:40.828 --> 02:37:44.029]  Now, this was sort of the pattern... No, Webster, I've got to stop you.
[02:37:44.029 --> 02:37:50.632]  I mean, remember, almost two years ago, you said they're going to play Saudi Arabia off against Iran in proxy wars.
[02:37:50.632 --> 02:37:53.293]  You said they're going to try to overthrow Iran internally.
[02:37:54.173 --> 02:37:56.475]  And exactly what you said happened.
[02:37:56.475 --> 02:37:57.975]  That's why we have you on so much.
[02:37:57.975 --> 02:38:02.939]  I mean, you're one of the only people in the world who actually gets it.
[02:38:02.939 --> 02:38:05.280]  And it's not that TV pundits don't get it.
[02:38:05.280 --> 02:38:10.623]  They're always talking nonsense because the public is fed on a diet of nonsense.
[02:38:10.623 --> 02:38:12.645]  You've read Brzezinski's books.
[02:38:12.645 --> 02:38:17.427]  You understand the geopolitical strategy of the Anglo-American establishment.
[02:38:17.427 --> 02:38:21.170]  Explain to people how you knew this two years ago.
[02:38:22.096 --> 02:38:31.922]  Well, part of it is just from reading these books, and part of it is just from having observed them for, it seems like, about 40 or 50 years by now, since I was a child.
[02:38:31.922 --> 02:38:38.146]  But look, concerning this Yemen business, that's one approach to getting Iran into trouble.
[02:38:38.146 --> 02:38:40.948]  The other thing is, remember that when the U.S.
[02:38:40.948 --> 02:38:43.750]  and the British fomented the rebellion of Balochistan,
[02:38:44.370 --> 02:38:48.412]  That will carve up not just Pakistan, but also Iran.
[02:38:48.412 --> 02:38:49.833]  So there's another approach.
[02:38:49.833 --> 02:38:52.955]  Let's also remember that they've got this thing in Arabistan.
[02:38:52.955 --> 02:39:05.022]  The oil area of Iran has an Arab population, and that's where we have this Akhvaz, or Arabistan Liberation Front, what I always call BP, British Petroleum Liberation Front, because that's
[02:39:05.462 --> 02:39:06.262]  What it is.
[02:39:06.262 --> 02:39:15.765]  And of course you've got this green coup, the CIA faction in Iran, the Death to Russia, Death to China faction around Mousavi and Rafsanjani.
[02:39:15.765 --> 02:39:16.985]  Now here's the thing.
[02:39:16.985 --> 02:39:26.008]  If anybody bombs Iran, it's an open secret that the Pasteran Revolutionary Guards will simply exterminate all the leaders of this so-called
[02:39:26.528 --> 02:39:34.811]  Opposition, Musavi, Rafsanjani, Khatami, this entire crew, they'll all be found floating in the river.
[02:39:34.811 --> 02:39:44.953]  So I don't see any attack on Iran as long as they can keep this people power coup, velvet revolution, post-modern coup thing going inside Iran.
[02:39:44.953 --> 02:39:46.594]  So, I think that's Iran.
[02:39:46.594 --> 02:39:48.815]  Now, Pakistan is a different story.
[02:39:48.815 --> 02:39:53.236]  Pakistan, you've got the massive escalation of the drone attacks, you've got
[02:39:54.108 --> 02:39:56.390]  Bombs going off inside Pakistan.
[02:39:56.390 --> 02:40:01.194]  Remember, it's Balochistan and Pashtunistan that are supposed to rebel.
[02:40:01.194 --> 02:40:07.119]  And in the past couple of weeks, they added another aspect of it, which is to play Shiites against Sunnis.
[02:40:07.119 --> 02:40:12.563]  Pakistan is largely Sunni, but there's a significant Shiite minority.
[02:40:12.563 --> 02:40:14.805]  And we just had a bomb go off in Karachi.
[02:40:15.465 --> 02:40:19.746]  And by the way, on every point you make, you have giant reams of documents, evidence, and history.
[02:40:19.746 --> 02:40:20.266]  Let's not forget
[02:40:39.932 --> 02:40:57.209]  2004, repeatedly 2005, 2006, British, US, and Israeli contractors and regular military, special air services out of England, are caught in multiple events dressed up
[02:40:58.494 --> 02:41:02.438]  As Sunnis running around killing Shiites and U.S.
[02:41:02.438 --> 02:41:05.641]  and British forces, British got caught doing it.
[02:41:05.641 --> 02:41:13.549]  Even Ray McGovern, former chief CIA analyst to Ronald Reagan, George Bush Sr., came on the show and said, I believe the bombing of the Golden Mosque was U.S.
[02:41:13.549 --> 02:41:14.510]  It came out a month later.
[02:41:15.595 --> 02:41:17.976]  They evacuate the neighborhood, U.S.
[02:41:17.976 --> 02:41:29.040]  Army pulls up, goes in and blows the mosque up in front of everyone, and then blames it on another Muslim group to get the Shiites and Sunnis killing each other.
[02:41:29.040 --> 02:41:31.281]  So, this is just done out in the open.
[02:41:31.281 --> 02:41:32.982]  This is standard procedure.
[02:41:33.542 --> 02:41:34.083]  Yeah.
[02:41:34.083 --> 02:41:36.965]  Al-Qaeda is the CIA Arab Legion.
[02:41:36.965 --> 02:41:40.868]  It's now expanded to be the CIA Muslim Legion.
[02:41:40.868 --> 02:41:46.472]  Al-Qaeda in Iraq was created by General McChrystal when he needed it.
[02:41:46.472 --> 02:41:57.221]  There had to be an Al-Qaeda in Iraq for propaganda needs, but also to prevent the Iraqi population from uniting against the invaders and the occupiers.
[02:41:57.221 --> 02:42:02.485]  And now we've got the new one, AQAP, Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is another
[02:42:02.885 --> 02:42:05.448]  Completely fake organization.
[02:42:05.448 --> 02:42:06.789]  Interesting story happened to me.
[02:42:06.789 --> 02:42:09.692]  I was on the radio with Algeria yesterday.
[02:42:09.692 --> 02:42:12.195]  The Algerian radio in Algiers.
[02:42:12.195 --> 02:42:16.860]  And they pointed out that there had been a statement from Bin Laden about which I don't really know anything.
[02:42:16.860 --> 02:42:17.581]  I wonder if you do.
[02:42:18.221 --> 02:42:30.367]  That Bin Laden had put out a statement attacking Iran and Hezbollah, the Shiite group there in Lebanon with Sheikh Nasrallah, the people who basically defeated the Israelis back in 2006.
[02:42:30.367 --> 02:42:35.389]  This would be very, very interesting to look into.
[02:42:35.389 --> 02:42:44.473]  There's always been this idea of playing the Arabs, Arabs and Sunnis you might say, against Iranians and Shiites.
[02:42:44.633 --> 02:42:44.773]  It's
[02:43:01.770 --> 02:43:12.581]  Afghanistan, so the story goes, right after 9-11, some of them went into Iran and they were seized and they were put under house arrest, some of them allegedly in the Saudi embassy.
[02:43:12.581 --> 02:43:22.492]  So you see there's a hostility between Al-Qaeda, which the Iranians have always called a CIA operation, and the Iranian government.
[02:43:22.492 --> 02:43:23.753]  Now, the bigger picture.
[02:43:24.497 --> 02:43:30.501]  What I see going on is a tendency of the world to get out of control of the U.S.
[02:43:30.501 --> 02:43:31.062]  and the British.
[02:43:31.062 --> 02:43:38.707]  In other words, the empire is in a big crisis, and people are attempting to free themselves from this yoke.
[02:43:38.707 --> 02:43:39.868]  Just a couple of examples.
[02:43:40.548 --> 02:43:50.451]  My reading of the Copenhagen Conference is that this was torpedoed by a joint operation, whether planned or unplanned, by Russia and China.
[02:43:50.451 --> 02:44:02.055]  In other words, the best account I can see is that those emails from the University of Anglia Climate Research Unit were first uploaded by a server in Tomsk in Siberia,
[02:44:02.295 --> 02:44:02.835]  We're good to go.
[02:44:27.859 --> 02:44:35.363]  Russia, China, Sudan defeated the Anglo-Americans and the European Union in the Copenhagen Conference.
[02:44:35.363 --> 02:44:44.527]  Now, further along the line, in these countries, you've got strong political signs of people who want to free themselves.
[02:44:44.527 --> 02:44:50.010]  That would be Italy, Japan, and Saudi Arabia, which we've mentioned to some extent.
[02:44:50.010 --> 02:44:51.691]  The Italian case is an interesting one.
[02:44:51.691 --> 02:44:53.312]  Why is Berlusconi targeted?
[02:44:53.792 --> 02:44:57.375]  Berlusconi is targeted because he's a close friend of Putin.
[02:44:57.375 --> 02:45:03.400]  He's involved with the South Stream oil pipeline, which involves Russia, Turkey, Italy.
[02:45:03.400 --> 02:45:06.382]  The French seem to be buying into this to some extent.
[02:45:06.382 --> 02:45:09.504]  Other countries in the Balkans are interested in it.
[02:45:09.504 --> 02:45:17.070]  So Berlusconi gets hit in the face by this massive heavy object there a couple of weeks before Christmas.
[02:45:17.070 --> 02:45:18.992]  In Japan, you've got the Hatoyama.
[02:45:20.213 --> 02:45:22.455]  There was just a clash here at the State Department.
[02:45:22.455 --> 02:45:28.962]  Hillary Clinton called in the Japanese ambassador and read him the Riot Act saying, we the U.S.
[02:45:28.962 --> 02:45:35.428]  demand that we move the Okinawa base from one part of the island to another and the Japanese don't like it.
[02:45:35.428 --> 02:45:41.995]  So Hillary Clinton is on the warpath against Japan and I think underneath that, in whatever confused or
[02:45:43.116 --> 02:45:51.673]  Or more complete form is the desire of the Japanese to assert some kind of national independence after being a ward of the United States for so many years.
[02:45:51.673 --> 02:45:52.695]  And then Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:53.511 --> 02:46:00.514]  It's interesting that in the past couple of weeks we've had a series of attacks on leading world governments.
[02:46:00.514 --> 02:46:03.676]  The Pope is tackled on New Year's Eve.
[02:46:03.676 --> 02:46:06.077]  It could have been an assassination attempt.
[02:46:06.077 --> 02:46:13.641]  Chirac, the former president of France, who led the opposition in the world against Bush's Iraq War, is indicted.
[02:46:14.581 --> 02:46:17.604]  Uh, Berlusconi, hit in the face by this object.
[02:46:17.604 --> 02:46:29.855]  In Pakistan, the president and the whole cabinet have had their immunity lifted, so that the president is fearing this guy Zardari, he fears criminal charges.
[02:46:29.855 --> 02:46:38.062]  The defense minister is told that he's not allowed to leave the country, and the interior minister, the police minister, is going to be subjected to an indictment.
[02:46:38.062 --> 02:46:41.225]  So you can see, there's an interesting pattern of things going on.
[02:46:42.071 --> 02:46:58.004]  So if you look across the world, you see resistance to London and New York coming from Russia, China, Sudan, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and, of course, the usual suspects, Pakistan and Iran.
[02:46:58.004 --> 02:47:02.708]  Who is organizing that resistance, or is that just happening organically?
[02:47:02.708 --> 02:47:04.389]  I think some of it's organized.
[02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:08.192]  Some of it's organized, some of it is simply ad hoc on the basis of individual intelligence.
[02:47:08.192 --> 02:47:09.934]  Do you think it's Russian intelligence behind it?
[02:47:10.825 --> 02:47:16.029]  No, I think part of it is just it's a structural aspect of the world.
[02:47:16.029 --> 02:47:17.571]  Things are breaking up, right?
[02:47:17.571 --> 02:47:21.474]  We've just had the crisis of the whole Anglo-American banking system.
[02:47:21.474 --> 02:47:27.679]  The degree of coordination, well, the degree of coordination between Berlusconi and Putin is total.
[02:47:27.679 --> 02:47:28.880]  That's for sure.
[02:47:28.880 --> 02:47:30.141]  There's no doubt about that one.
[02:47:30.521 --> 02:47:33.805]  Bandar, friend of Putin, once again.
[02:47:33.805 --> 02:47:37.148]  Japan, that's a little bit less clear to me.
[02:47:37.148 --> 02:47:39.170]  And now we have a major break though.
[02:47:39.170 --> 02:47:39.751]  I should interrupt.
[02:47:39.751 --> 02:47:41.132]  Finish that thought before I forget.
[02:47:42.113 --> 02:47:48.577]  We now have Putin coming out announcing we're going to produce even more deadly nukes since you're still encircling us.
[02:47:48.577 --> 02:47:55.082]  So that means that Obama three months ago saying, I'm not going to put the missiles in.
[02:47:55.082 --> 02:47:56.863]  We knew that was a classic fraud.
[02:47:56.863 --> 02:47:58.884]  He always says one thing, does another.
[02:47:58.884 --> 02:48:06.970]  So we're seeing the world shift right now in what I see globally as a portent of World War III.
[02:48:06.970 --> 02:48:11.713]  I mean, if wars start in a couple more places, won't that be the makings of a world war?
[02:48:12.613 --> 02:48:14.374]  Well, it doesn't have to become a world war.
[02:48:14.374 --> 02:48:19.637]  I would compare it to Germany looking at Great Britain, or Great Britain looking at Germany before 1914.
[02:48:19.637 --> 02:48:37.408]  In other words, the British are sitting there bankrupt, rather decadent, the empire running out of steam, and they see this rising industrial power of Germany, which has got all kinds of problems, but nevertheless they have a lot of economic growth.
[02:48:37.988 --> 02:48:42.770]  And the British basically say, well, if we have a peace race with them, we'll lose it.
[02:48:42.770 --> 02:48:46.671]  The only way we can deal with them is to encircle them and have a war.
[02:48:46.671 --> 02:48:53.073]  And I think, you've got to remember, the Wall Street people respond to the collapse of their financial structures.
[02:48:53.073 --> 02:49:00.576]  When you have a world depression, when you have a world financial collapse like this, the response of London and Wall Street is to go berserk.
[02:49:00.576 --> 02:49:04.917]  They go bonkers and they look around for these desperate, crazy plans, like,
[02:49:05.257 --> 02:49:08.801]  Who in his right mind wants to play Saudi Arabia against Iran?
[02:49:08.801 --> 02:49:10.323]  What's the benefit?
[02:49:10.323 --> 02:49:21.717]  Well, they'd say, well, if we can get the price of oil up to $500 a barrel, that will soak up all the dollars in the world, and that will give the dollar a new lease on life, because there won't be so many dollars.
[02:49:22.858 --> 02:49:28.879]  Clearly they're desperate to create a world crisis, to unify political support and to jack up commodities.
[02:49:28.879 --> 02:49:29.919]  They're going to do it.
[02:49:29.919 --> 02:49:32.220]  And I totally agree.
[02:49:32.220 --> 02:49:38.161]  England, the Milner Group, they said we ought to finance rabble-rousers to take over Germany, Hitler.
[02:49:38.161 --> 02:49:40.381]  We ought to fund the Soviets to threaten them.
[02:49:40.381 --> 02:49:49.383]  Well, I mean, that came after World War I. We ought to kill their leaders to get them to physically attack us.
[02:49:49.383 --> 02:49:51.443]  I mean, we're going to see those same types of things now.
[02:49:52.159 --> 02:49:56.263]  Let me just also, what you point to with Putin is very important.
[02:49:56.263 --> 02:50:04.390]  The US and Russia are renegotiating a renewal of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty of 1991.
[02:50:04.390 --> 02:50:06.352]  It was signed under Bush the Elder and Gorbachev.
[02:50:10.355 --> 02:50:19.738]  This expired on the 5th of December, and all during the last couple of weeks, the word was coming from the State Department, well, it's just a few more little things we have to clear up.
[02:50:19.738 --> 02:50:20.978]  Don't worry, we'll get to it.
[02:50:20.978 --> 02:50:23.679]  But then Putin comes out and says, wait a minute.
[02:50:23.679 --> 02:50:32.982]  If you're going to have a defensive shield of anti-ballistic missiles, and you're going to deploy those in the Mediterranean and elsewhere, we cannot discuss offensive weapons
[02:50:33.622 --> 02:50:36.666]  Apart from defensive weapons, we've got to put it all back together.
[02:50:36.666 --> 02:50:42.954]  So it looks like Putin is blocking whatever ideas have been developed for a deal.
[02:50:42.954 --> 02:50:47.600]  There will be no deal until Putin's demands are met.
[02:50:47.600 --> 02:50:49.923]  That's quite a checkmate for Obama.
[02:50:52.025 --> 02:50:58.391]  Well, he said they're gonna come out with a new Super Topol, and the quote is here because, quote, the U.S.

[02:52:06.840 --> 02:52:10.064]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:52:10.064 --> 02:52:11.486]  As we're finishing off this agenda...
[02:52:12.190 --> 02:52:14.891]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[02:52:14.891 --> 02:52:21.253]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:52:21.253 --> 02:52:26.795]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:52:26.795 --> 02:52:36.439]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:52:36.559 --> 02:52:38.901]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:52:38.901 --> 02:52:40.482]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:52:40.482 --> 02:52:42.944]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:52:42.944 --> 02:52:45.065]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:52:45.065 --> 02:52:50.229]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[02:54:28.638 --> 02:54:31.060]  Okay, Webster, you've talked about what's going on in the world.
[02:54:31.060 --> 02:54:33.982]  It's absolutely spot-on from my own research.
[02:54:33.982 --> 02:54:39.125]  Always amazing to see you predict things so far out in the future.
[02:54:39.125 --> 02:54:40.546]  So let's look into the future.
[02:54:40.546 --> 02:54:42.348]  What do you see happening in the next year?
[02:54:42.348 --> 02:54:53.996]  Our catchwords would be depression, continued economic depression, maybe getting worse in the second wave.
[02:54:53.996 --> 02:54:55.037]  That could easily come in 2010.
[02:54:55.037 --> 02:54:55.817]  If not then, then 2011.
[02:54:58.977 --> 02:55:02.363]  Uh, so depression, uh, and uh, repression.
[02:55:02.363 --> 02:55:03.645]  The repression is...
[02:55:05.328 --> 02:55:06.429]  Obama.
[02:55:06.429 --> 02:55:09.271]  I put out some interviews.
[02:55:09.271 --> 02:55:12.733]  By the way, people can see all this or hear it at tarpley.net.
[02:55:12.733 --> 02:55:23.039]  I finally got my website upgraded, so if you haven't seen it, the upgrades went up just a little bit before Christmas, so if people haven't looked at it, please do take a look, tarpley.net.
[02:55:23.039 --> 02:55:30.824]  The idea being, the comparison of Obama to Woodrow Wilson, a pedant, an elitist, a professor,
[02:55:32.907 --> 02:55:35.648]  Woodrow Wilson ran for president in 1916.
[02:55:35.648 --> 02:55:37.629]  He was, of course, a Morgan puppet.
[02:55:37.629 --> 02:55:39.810]  He had been put into office by J.P.
[02:55:39.810 --> 02:55:45.633]  Morgan, who got rid of William Howard Taft to open the way for Woodrow Wilson.
[02:55:45.633 --> 02:55:50.735]  This is where we get the Federal Reserve System and a whole lot of other bad things.
[02:55:51.795 --> 02:55:54.776]  And he ran on this week, he kept us out of war, right?
[02:55:54.776 --> 02:56:05.241]  Don't get into World War I. So he wins the election in 1916 and then turns around as soon as he's back in office, within a month, he wants to declare war on Germany, which he does do.
[02:56:05.241 --> 02:56:12.303]  And then he passes the Espionage Act and the Sedition Act and throws a couple of thousand people in jail.
[02:56:12.303 --> 02:56:16.865]  It's light years, orders of magnitude beyond Bush-Cheney.
[02:56:16.865 --> 02:56:17.926]  The worst civil liberties
[02:56:19.013 --> 02:56:19.533]  We're good.
[02:56:36.403 --> 02:56:37.204]  Afghanistan.
[02:56:37.204 --> 02:56:41.047]  Obama is now losing his base.
[02:56:41.047 --> 02:56:53.597]  The black community, the people over at the Black Agenda Report in particular, are up in arms and they're gaining in influence because the black unemployment is sky high and Obama refuses to do anything.
[02:56:53.597 --> 02:56:57.961]  The greens, of course, are unhappy because Obama was checkmated in Copenhagen.
[02:56:57.961 --> 02:57:02.044]  The anti-war people, in particular, are becoming more and more active.
[02:57:02.865 --> 02:57:11.458]  Very good demonstration here on the 12th of December with Kucinich, Gravel, McKinney, and Ralph Nader.
[02:57:11.458 --> 02:57:17.106]  And the left has now found out that the health care plan is a giant robbery, has nothing to do with their precious socialism.
[02:57:17.987 --> 02:57:30.170]  Let me just mention, there's going to be a demonstration specifically against the CIA drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan at Langley, at the CIA headquarters, I think, the 16th of January.
[02:57:30.170 --> 02:57:37.832]  That's Cindy Sheehan and Cynthia McKinney and their group of the Peace of the Action, P-E-A-C-E, Peace of the Action.
[02:57:38.852 --> 02:57:39.513]  Some think.
[02:57:39.513 --> 02:57:44.715]  So the anti-war people now making, I think, a comeback, and that's of course most welcome.
[02:57:44.715 --> 02:57:54.181]  As you say, the fact that Obama has totally sold out to the private insurance companies and the private pharmaceutical cartel, that's evident to everybody.
[02:57:54.181 --> 02:57:57.843]  Gay rights people very, very upset because he hasn't done anything for them.
[02:57:57.843 --> 02:57:59.463]  So what's going to happen?
[02:57:59.463 --> 02:58:02.505]  I mean, we know Obama, but he's just a little puppet front man.
[02:58:02.505 --> 02:58:04.006]  Right, right, okay.
[02:58:04.006 --> 02:58:05.807]  I'm not really too worried about what he's doing.
[02:58:06.007 --> 02:58:15.273]  By the way, in terms of attacks on governments, right, along with the Pope getting tackled, Chirac getting indicted, Berlusconi getting smashed in the face, look at what happened to Obama.
[02:58:15.273 --> 02:58:17.034]  Two people led into the White House.
[02:58:17.034 --> 02:58:20.996]  Two separate incidents where people waltzed right in.
[02:58:20.996 --> 02:58:25.499]  It's a way for the rogue network to say to Obama, follow orders because we can get you anytime.
[02:58:27.185 --> 02:58:28.706]  You think that's what the message is?
[02:58:28.706 --> 02:58:32.668]  I think that was the message of those two adventurers who came into the state dinner with manly instincts.
[02:58:32.668 --> 02:58:40.791]  Alright, but Webster, in the little bit of time we've got left, specifically, what do you see with the economy, what do you see with the military next year?
[02:58:40.791 --> 02:58:41.852]  Stay with us.
[02:58:41.852 --> 02:58:47.414]  America's number one source for independent talk radio for over a decade.
[02:58:47.414 --> 02:58:50.656]  We are the GCN Radio Network.
[02:58:51.943 --> 02:58:54.944]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:58:54.944 --> 02:59:00.266]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:59:00.266 --> 02:59:02.326]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:59:02.326 --> 02:59:07.328]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:59:07.328 --> 02:59:08.508]  How much do you want?
[02:59:08.508 --> 02:59:09.629]  When do you want it?
[02:59:09.629 --> 02:59:11.509]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:59:11.509 --> 02:59:12.589]  When will you need it?
[02:59:12.589 --> 02:59:14.790]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:59:14.790 --> 02:59:16.131]  Will there be any food?
[02:59:16.131 --> 02:59:17.431]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:59:17.651 --> 02:59:22.917]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:59:22.917 --> 02:59:26.501]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:59:26.501 --> 02:59:30.326]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:59:30.326 --> 02:59:31.567]  How much will you need?
[02:59:31.567 --> 02:59:32.468]  We don't know.
[02:59:32.468 --> 02:59:33.570]  How much do you want?
[02:59:33.570 --> 02:59:34.491]  All you can get.
[02:59:34.491 --> 02:59:35.312]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:59:35.572 --> 02:59:38.634]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:59:38.634 --> 02:59:41.476]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:59:41.476 --> 02:59:42.297]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:42.297 --> 02:59:43.558]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:43.558 --> 02:59:45.579]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:14.775 --> 03:00:19.519]  All right, Webster's going to leave us in about 15 minutes and we'll get to the calls that are holding.
[03:00:19.519 --> 03:00:23.963]  There's so many other issues I want to get into.
[03:00:23.963 --> 03:00:26.825]  I want to go over the decade of tyranny.
[03:00:26.825 --> 03:00:33.451]  No doubt, in modern history, the last decade has been an incredible time of corruption.
[03:00:33.451 --> 03:00:38.595]  And yes, I know technically the decade isn't over for another year, but the media started the millennium in 2000.
[03:00:38.595 --> 03:00:41.037]  They started the new century in 2000.
[03:00:41.037 --> 03:00:43.039]  That's like starting
[03:00:45.040 --> 03:00:47.362]  10 at 9 or 21 at 20.
[03:00:47.362 --> 03:00:56.973]  But the point is, the last 10 years has been an incredible time of tyranny, but also a big time of awakening as the global banking empire...
[03:00:58.234 --> 03:01:03.676]  Tries to suck the last juices out of the United States to fund its tyrannical program.
[03:01:03.676 --> 03:01:06.277]  Alright, Webster, what do you see happening on the military front?
[03:01:06.277 --> 03:01:09.219]  I mean, you said war, war, war.
[03:01:09.219 --> 03:01:15.681]  Through proxies, through destabilization campaigns, through funding rebel groups.
[03:01:15.681 --> 03:01:18.483]  What do you see domestically happening?
[03:01:18.483 --> 03:01:22.865]  Where do you see all this going as they try to tell us we've had a jobless recovery?
[03:01:22.865 --> 03:01:23.745]  What do you see happening?
[03:01:24.434 --> 03:01:30.463]  Well, let me cite a couple of predictions coming from others that I think are probably worthy of being considered.
[03:01:31.332 --> 03:01:36.895]  Remember the old Able Danger group in the D.I.A.?
[03:01:36.895 --> 03:01:39.976]  We had this Colonel Anthony Schaefer.
[03:01:39.976 --> 03:01:40.496]  Remember this?
[03:01:40.496 --> 03:01:47.999]  This was Congressman Kurt Weldon, Republican of Pennsylvania, brought out this guy, Colonel Schaefer, and started to talk about Able Danger.
[03:01:47.999 --> 03:01:58.124]  And the idea was, of course, that they had identified ATA and company well before 9-11, but they had these post-it notes saying, don't tell the FBI or don't tell anybody.
[03:01:58.624 --> 03:01:59.645]  About this guy.
[03:01:59.645 --> 03:02:05.367]  My view has always been that Able Danger were not hunting for terrorists.
[03:02:05.367 --> 03:02:07.528]  They were supervising terrorists.
[03:02:07.528 --> 03:02:12.530]  In other words, they were patsy minders, patsy monitors, patsy chaperones.
[03:02:12.530 --> 03:02:18.253]  They were making sure that ATA and company kept within the bounds of what they were supposed to do, right?
[03:02:18.253 --> 03:02:23.075]  That they attacked when and what was wanted.
[03:02:23.075 --> 03:02:24.156]  Anyway, Colonel Schaefer,
[03:02:24.816 --> 03:02:33.092]  Was on the Jerry Doyle radio talk show yesterday, disguised as sort of a moderate reactionary to Neocon.
[03:02:33.895 --> 03:02:38.800]  And Colonel Schaefer basically said, well, you know, we haven't connected the dots again, right?
[03:02:38.800 --> 03:02:40.401]  We don't connect the dots.
[03:02:40.401 --> 03:02:42.143]  The agencies don't talk to each other.
[03:02:42.143 --> 03:02:43.284]  It's all bureaucracy.
[03:02:43.284 --> 03:02:44.605]  The usual nonsense, right?
[03:02:44.605 --> 03:02:47.587]  To hide the obvious fact that these are protected patsies.
[03:02:47.587 --> 03:02:59.058]  Punish us with more power and funds, and get rid of your whole Bill of Rights, slit your wrists, feed the blood directly into our mouths, and maybe we'll save you from the deadly underwear bomber.
[03:02:59.418 --> 03:02:59.858]  Right.
[03:02:59.858 --> 03:03:07.682]  So Colonel Schaeffer says, I don't think we'll ever wake up until a 10 kiloton bomb goes off in an American city.
[03:03:07.682 --> 03:03:11.704]  So that's his view of the years ahead.
[03:03:11.704 --> 03:03:15.927]  I would also add, it doesn't have to necessarily be in the US.
[03:03:15.927 --> 03:03:18.528]  There are some signs that might suggest someplace else.
[03:03:18.528 --> 03:03:20.129]  Of course, Europe is always a big
[03:03:20.729 --> 03:03:21.090]  We're good.
[03:03:33.837 --> 03:03:41.767]  As you say, the absurdity of the bureaucratic position is basically the more we fail, the more power we demand.
[03:03:41.767 --> 03:03:43.549]  And I would suggest the following.
[03:03:43.549 --> 03:03:51.859]  Janet Napolitano, alias totalitariano, alias incompetano, she should be fired, or she should quit.
[03:03:52.399 --> 03:03:56.660]  We don't know whether she's incompetent or whether she's complicit.
[03:03:56.660 --> 03:03:57.960]  And we don't want to wait to find out.
[03:03:57.960 --> 03:03:59.100]  We want to get her out.
[03:03:59.100 --> 03:04:03.701]  Hillary Clinton at the State Department failed to pull the visa for this guy.
[03:04:03.701 --> 03:04:06.222]  Should be fired or made to quit.
[03:04:06.222 --> 03:04:15.824]  Leon Panetta at the CIA should be fired or made to quit because... But instead we reward failure because they're really not failing.
[03:04:15.824 --> 03:04:17.564]  They pulled off a great false flag.
[03:04:17.904 --> 03:04:20.306]  Let me finish my list.
[03:04:20.306 --> 03:04:28.334]  Dennis Blair, the intelligence czar, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center that couldn't get this patsy's name onto the no-fly list.
[03:04:28.334 --> 03:04:29.796]  Fire him.
[03:04:29.796 --> 03:04:35.862]  James Jones, the head of the National Security Council, the overall responsible for all this stuff.
[03:04:35.862 --> 03:04:38.344]  No, no, we'll punish him with more power.
[03:04:38.344 --> 03:04:38.764]  Stay there.
[03:04:40.814 --> 03:04:41.535]  I have one other.
[03:04:41.535 --> 03:04:43.016]  Go ahead.
[03:04:43.016 --> 03:04:48.900]  That's John Brennan, Obama's in-house White House security advisor.
[03:04:48.900 --> 03:04:50.481]  Brennan, fire him too.
[03:04:50.481 --> 03:04:51.102]  No, no, no, no.
[03:04:51.102 --> 03:04:51.742]  We'll teach him.
[03:04:51.742 --> 03:04:53.544]  We'll give him more power.
[03:04:53.544 --> 03:04:55.965]  Because they really did a great job.
[03:04:55.965 --> 03:04:58.307]  And we're not going to fire him for more drugs being on the street.
[03:04:58.307 --> 03:04:59.128]  That's their job.
[03:05:01.308 --> 03:05:05.410]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator.

[03:06:01.144 --> 03:06:06.451]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:06:06.451 --> 03:06:10.997]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:06:10.997 --> 03:06:13.280]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:06:13.280 --> 03:06:14.882]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:06:14.882 --> 03:06:15.924]  There is a solution.

[03:07:01.018 --> 03:07:05.582]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:07:05.582 --> 03:07:06.482]  Number one.
[03:07:06.482 --> 03:07:09.925]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:07:09.925 --> 03:07:10.766]  Number two.
[03:07:10.766 --> 03:07:15.669]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:07:15.669 --> 03:07:16.410]  It's true.
[03:07:16.410 --> 03:07:21.294]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:07:21.294 --> 03:07:22.114]  Number three.
[03:07:22.114 --> 03:07:25.697]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:07:25.697 --> 03:07:29.400]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:07:29.600 --> 03:07:30.400]  Number 4.
[03:07:30.400 --> 03:07:33.142]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:07:33.142 --> 03:07:36.844]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:07:36.844 --> 03:07:37.624]  Number 5.
[03:07:37.624 --> 03:07:41.766]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:07:41.766 --> 03:07:46.529]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:07:46.829 --> 03:07:50.991]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:50.991 --> 03:07:52.771]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:07:52.771 --> 03:07:55.032]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[03:07:55.032 --> 03:07:57.633]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[03:07:57.633 --> 03:08:07.197]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:07.197 --> 03:08:09.478]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:08:15.899 --> 03:08:17.560]  Here's a headline out of Reuters.
[03:08:17.560 --> 03:08:20.303]  You have no idea this is even true.
[03:08:20.303 --> 03:08:37.617]  Afghan attacks kills seven CIA employees, five Canadians, and the CIA Panetta says that there are plenty of people here who are capable and willing to make sure these people will be avenged.
[03:08:38.775 --> 03:08:45.638]  Like all the weddings you bomb, to kill one person you'll kill 50, 60, 100 plus innocent people?
[03:08:45.638 --> 03:08:51.380]  In a country you don't have a declaration of war against with drones?
[03:08:51.380 --> 03:08:53.381]  In our own country they're arresting U.S.
[03:08:53.381 --> 03:09:00.704]  citizens and holding them for years without charging them because they might have known al-Qaeda?
[03:09:00.704 --> 03:09:03.685]  We talked about this yesterday with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[03:09:03.685 --> 03:09:07.747]  I mean, we've got about as many rights in this country as somebody did under Stalin.
[03:09:08.598 --> 03:09:11.547]  They're just not out arresting the general public en masse.
[03:09:12.844 --> 03:09:13.244]  We're good to go.
[03:09:43.764 --> 03:09:47.486]  No, it's a war against Pakistan, above all.
[03:09:47.486 --> 03:09:55.450]  Pakistan, 160 million people, nuclear weapons, strong ally of China, economic partner of China, has to be destroyed.
[03:09:55.450 --> 03:09:59.792]  The importance of Pakistan is... But why did the West give, help give them the nukes then, their A.Q.
[03:09:59.792 --> 03:10:00.593]  Khan?
[03:10:00.593 --> 03:10:06.076]  It's all, you know, these imperialists weave a complicated web once they get started.
[03:10:06.076 --> 03:10:06.776]  But here's the idea.
[03:10:07.196 --> 03:10:09.879]  Think of Pakistan as Pipeline-istan.
[03:10:09.879 --> 03:10:13.943]  Pipeline-istan goes from Iran... No, I mean, you hold Central Asia.
[03:10:13.943 --> 03:10:16.025]  As Brzezinski said, you can project power everywhere.
[03:10:16.025 --> 03:10:18.467]  But I'm talking about economically right now.
[03:10:18.467 --> 03:10:23.392]  Isn't the $500 billion in smack leveraged to $5 trillion a year quite a juicy plum?
[03:10:23.692 --> 03:10:26.695]  It is, but this is not the main object as far as I can see.
[03:10:26.695 --> 03:10:39.608]  The object is to prevent pipelines from being built from the Iranian oil and natural gas field across Pakistan, over the Himalayas, near K2, up there, and into China.
[03:10:39.608 --> 03:10:42.391]  This would then give China a guaranteed overland route
[03:10:42.711 --> 03:10:43.151]  We're good.
[03:11:01.357 --> 03:11:05.319]  People like Saudi Arabia looking to China rather than London and New York.
[03:11:18.266 --> 03:11:26.068]  Here's the idea though, the two ethnic groups that happen to be goaded into rebellion, the Pashtuns are on both sides of this border.
[03:11:26.068 --> 03:11:37.311]  So we're in Afghanistan to make sure there's a bigger rebellion in Pakistan to spread rebellion then into all the surrounding countries and then overthrow them and spread it into the next endlessly.
[03:11:37.671 --> 03:11:48.575]  Right, so the Pashtuns have got to be occupied and antagonized on the Afghan side, and then if they flee to the Pakistani side there, they've got to be attacked by snipers.
[03:11:48.575 --> 03:11:52.037]  Again, the Taliban say Blackwater is there massively.
[03:11:52.037 --> 03:11:53.577]  There's really no doubt about it.
[03:11:53.577 --> 03:11:58.899]  According to The Nation magazine also, you've got Blackwater with snipers, with various
[03:12:01.460 --> 03:12:04.823]  The sharpshooters and the snatch-and-grab kidnapping operation.
[03:12:04.823 --> 03:12:07.605]  So if you're a Pashtun, you're going to be driven to rebel.
[03:12:07.605 --> 03:12:10.267]  You're going to be driven into the arms of the Taliban.
[03:12:10.267 --> 03:12:13.490]  And the same story, they've extended that now into Balochistan.
[03:12:13.490 --> 03:12:16.852]  And Balochistan is the part that goes over into Iran.
[03:12:16.852 --> 03:12:29.563]  So the entire goal of this operation is to promote a civil war inside Pakistan so that it's broken up and these pipelines can never be built and China can never get a guaranteed overland means of getting
[03:12:30.363 --> 03:12:31.303]  Oil.
[03:12:31.303 --> 03:12:35.905]  And that was the main message of Obama's West Point speech.
[03:12:35.905 --> 03:12:39.986]  Also notice that now with Obama we have the new axis of evil, right?
[03:12:39.986 --> 03:12:44.928]  The Bush axis of evil was Iraq, Iran, and North Korea way back when.
[03:12:44.928 --> 03:12:53.091]  The new axis of evil is now Afghanistan, Pakistan, understood as one thing, Somalia, and Yemen.
[03:12:53.091 --> 03:12:53.971]  So we're back to that.
[03:12:54.791 --> 03:12:58.315]  All right, here's the big question.
[03:12:58.315 --> 03:13:00.638]  How is this going to unfold the next year?
[03:13:00.638 --> 03:13:07.125]  What is the goal of the Anglo-American global establishment versus what you think they're going to get?
[03:13:07.125 --> 03:13:09.447]  And then what is their other goals around the world?
[03:13:09.447 --> 03:13:10.628]  How are things going for them?
[03:13:10.628 --> 03:13:10.929]  Briefly.
[03:13:11.269 --> 03:13:15.253]  Well, I think the dominant mood in Wall Street and London is desperation.
[03:13:15.253 --> 03:13:23.362]  You saw that this large Austrian bank, Hupo Alpe Adria, went bankrupt, 40 billion euros.
[03:13:23.362 --> 03:13:28.187]  And now you've got this entire group of countries on the verge of sovereign default.
[03:13:28.187 --> 03:13:30.249]  In other words, state bankruptcy.
[03:13:30.249 --> 03:13:31.651]  It's the so-called pigs group.
[03:13:32.151 --> 03:13:40.137]  Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, Spain, and Greece seems to be the most immediate of that group.
[03:13:40.137 --> 03:13:47.063]  So the idea is that the Greeks would try to auction some of their state bonds and nobody would come.
[03:13:47.063 --> 03:13:48.784]  That could happen to the US.
[03:13:48.784 --> 03:13:49.205]  Right now,
[03:13:49.805 --> 03:13:55.306]  The euro, because of these complications, the euro is collapsing faster than the dollar.
[03:13:55.306 --> 03:13:59.967]  So the dollar has had a little bit of a reprieve in terms of the value of the dollar, right?
[03:13:59.967 --> 03:14:05.048]  The euro has been going down, and that has kind of masked the weakness of the dollar.
[03:14:05.048 --> 03:14:09.088]  But of course, we know over here, we've got the commercial real estate crisis.
[03:14:09.088 --> 03:14:18.790]  Those, you know, a trillion or more or less a trillion dollars of commercial real estate leases and other things that come up, and a lot of that will go into default.
[03:14:19.530 --> 03:14:22.353]  So that's going to be another burden on the banking system.
[03:14:22.353 --> 03:14:30.021]  Maybe people notice General Motors Acceptance Corporation, GMAC, just got another three to four billion dollar bailout.
[03:14:30.021 --> 03:14:32.504]  And of course what that involves is DITECH funding.
[03:14:32.504 --> 03:14:39.010]  DITECH funding is, or was, GMAC and they went way into derivatives and that's what you've got.
[03:14:39.010 --> 03:14:41.893]  So the build up, you know, we're about
[03:14:42.914 --> 03:14:46.436]  What, a month since Dubai blew.
[03:14:46.436 --> 03:14:56.922]  And in the month since Dubai, you can see that the rhythm of bank bankruptcies, bank failures, and just general financial turbulence across the world, that has all increased.
[03:14:56.922 --> 03:15:00.244]  So, I think the depression will get worse.
[03:15:00.244 --> 03:15:01.445]  The main goal of the U.S.
[03:15:01.445 --> 03:15:06.428]  and the British is to block the peaceful economic development of everybody else.
[03:15:06.428 --> 03:15:09.370]  Russia says, let's have the North Stream pipeline down the Baltic.
[03:15:10.303 --> 03:15:12.485]  Doesn't attack anybody.
[03:15:12.485 --> 03:15:12.645]  U.S.
[03:15:12.645 --> 03:15:13.886]  and the British say no.
[03:15:13.886 --> 03:15:18.489]  They say, let's have the South Stream so you can get natural gas in Southern Europe.
[03:15:18.489 --> 03:15:18.629]  U.S.
[03:15:18.629 --> 03:15:19.849]  and the British say no.
[03:15:19.849 --> 03:15:22.411]  And in the meantime, look at China, right?
[03:15:22.411 --> 03:15:29.036]  They've got this fantastic high-speed rail from Canton, Guangzhou, up to Wuhan.
[03:15:29.036 --> 03:15:30.717]  So it's a thousand kilometers.
[03:15:31.497 --> 03:15:33.278]  About what, 600 miles?
[03:15:33.278 --> 03:15:44.643]  But we're not allowed to have that here because we have these Malthusian post-industrialists who openly say they want carbon taxes to put us into the Stone Age so they can make us more manageable.
[03:15:44.643 --> 03:15:51.626]  They want everyone living in mud huts with loincloths but themselves up in their high-tech palaces.
[03:15:51.626 --> 03:15:55.628]  I mean, these are the worst, most greedy control freaks ever known.
[03:15:55.948 --> 03:15:59.192]  Right, and I would suggest that we need a stimulus.
[03:15:59.192 --> 03:15:59.732]  I mean, the U.S.
[03:15:59.732 --> 03:16:03.616]  economy is going to need massive stimulus, but let's make it a real stimulus.
[03:16:03.616 --> 03:16:10.284]  Take that Chinese train, which can go, I think it's about 200 miles an hour, thereabouts.
[03:16:10.284 --> 03:16:11.285]  We could do better than that.
[03:16:11.285 --> 03:16:12.966]  We could get up to 300, maybe 400 miles an hour.
[03:16:14.748 --> 03:16:27.232]  With Maglev, but we could build a New York to San Francisco transcontinental Maglev that would really compete with... No, instead the globalists want to harass people into not traveling.
[03:16:27.232 --> 03:16:28.953]  That's the problem.
[03:16:28.953 --> 03:16:35.015]  They want us living in slums while they live in palaces, literally walking on platinum paved streets.
[03:16:35.715 --> 03:16:42.583]  Right, and that of course then poses the question of some kind of independent political organization.
[03:16:42.583 --> 03:16:51.332]  If you look at what's happening, the leftists generally were completely duped by Obama in 2007-2008, and I'm afraid the people going to the Tea Party rallies
[03:16:55.376 --> 03:16:56.197]  That's right, they're told!
[03:17:12.369 --> 03:17:18.934]  You defeat the New World Order by the banks ruling everything, and we've got to attack some more brown people.
[03:17:18.934 --> 03:17:27.400]  That's how you really rebel, and Obama's not attacking enough countries, and we need more body scanners.
[03:17:27.400 --> 03:17:30.602]  And just a year ago it was, yay, anti-New World Order!
[03:17:30.602 --> 03:17:34.685]  Down with the private Federal Reserve, now it's, give the bankers more power!
[03:17:34.685 --> 03:17:36.307]  Body scan me!
[03:17:36.307 --> 03:17:37.508]  I'm conservative!
[03:17:38.408 --> 03:17:53.321]  Yes, and you can see, again, if the Tea Party management had been honest, you would have had Pullman Democrats, you could have had conservative Democrats who were anti-Obama, you could have had this entire Ron Paul area of opinion, of libertarians, people like this.
[03:17:53.681 --> 03:17:56.004]  You could have had some anti-war people, why not?
[03:17:56.004 --> 03:18:04.154]  But no, automatically they've got to be warmongers and pro-Federal Reserve and essentially, you know, follow the Republican Congressional leadership.
[03:18:04.154 --> 03:18:12.124]  So, a lot of the people who go to the Tea Parties tell themselves that this is not controlled by the Republican Party, but in reality it seems to be pretty much controlled.
[03:18:12.705 --> 03:18:17.529]  Well, Webster, in closing, I want you to have a great 2010.
[03:18:17.529 --> 03:18:19.631]  Do you not agree with me, though?
[03:18:19.631 --> 03:18:20.351]  I want to see if you do.
[03:18:20.351 --> 03:18:21.592]  I have no idea.
[03:18:21.592 --> 03:18:28.298]  If the worm is turning, the pendulum is beginning to stop and go back in our direction towards liberty, freedom.
[03:18:28.298 --> 03:18:35.323]  It's always darkest before the dawn, but I really do see that there is a mass awakening, and even if they try to hijack
[03:18:36.161 --> 03:18:55.104]  The resistance that works for a shorter and shorter periods now and that the jig really is up and that we are on the edge of a massive change and that all of us being involved now can really have a chance in shaping the future destiny of humanity.
[03:18:55.799 --> 03:18:57.040]  Yes, I would agree with that.
[03:18:57.040 --> 03:19:03.064]  I mean, certainly, if you look just at this narrow question of false flag terrorism, this is wearing very thin.
[03:19:03.064 --> 03:19:17.955]  In other words, I think for a lot of people, the idea that the famous now Umar Farooq Muttalib, that this character is somebody on a mission, that he is a protective patsy, and
[03:19:18.115 --> 03:19:24.460]  We've got scores of mainstream news articles now saying, why is the government lying?
[03:19:24.460 --> 03:19:38.110]  What you see again with the Obama campaign in one way and now the big takeover of the Tea Parties by the Republicans, if you don't have some independent form of organization, you will fall prey and you will be used
[03:19:38.809 --> 03:19:39.029]  I agree.
[03:19:39.029 --> 03:19:40.230]  Webster, great job.
[03:19:40.230 --> 03:19:42.311]  We will see you next year, my friend.
[03:19:42.311 --> 03:19:43.812]  Well, you know what?
[03:19:43.812 --> 03:19:45.433]  Come back and talk about Petraeus.
[03:19:45.433 --> 03:19:46.354]  That's important.
[03:19:46.354 --> 03:19:48.015]  Happy New Year to all.
[03:20:02.492 --> 03:20:04.253]  This is an emergency alert.
[03:20:04.253 --> 03:20:06.655]  People don't die of H1N1 infection.
[03:20:06.655 --> 03:20:10.217]  They die from system-wide intoxication and toxic shock.
[03:20:10.217 --> 03:20:15.000]  Doctors call it the cytokine storm following infection and immune hyperstimulation.
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:20.163]  Vaccines with immune stimulants or toxic drugs chemicalize your body, adding to your death risk.
[03:20:20.743 --> 03:20:25.248]  Prevent death and reverse diseases from infections, vaccinations, and drug toxicity.

[03:20:39.822 --> 03:20:41.444]  Avoid vaccinations and drugs.
[03:20:41.864 --> 03:20:47.189]  Use Zeolife and OxySilver Hydrosol instead to detox and de-germ your body.
[03:20:47.189 --> 03:20:50.091]  Stop the shock of toxicity and preventable deaths.

[03:22:02.606 --> 03:22:06.608]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:22:06.608 --> 03:22:09.869]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:22:09.869 --> 03:22:14.671]  As they're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[03:22:14.671 --> 03:22:18.513]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[03:22:19.153 --> 03:22:21.034]  And they really are calling the shots.
[03:22:21.034 --> 03:22:26.256]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us, as American citizens, to pay attention.
[03:22:26.256 --> 03:22:29.518]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[03:22:29.518 --> 03:22:36.361]  The criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty, and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:22:36.361 --> 03:22:38.702]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:22:38.702 --> 03:22:40.303]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:22:40.303 --> 03:22:42.744]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:22:42.744 --> 03:22:44.885]  Today, it seems like nobody does care.
[03:22:44.885 --> 03:22:46.406]  And right now in Washington, D.C.,
[03:22:47.106 --> 03:22:50.010]  We have seen a fall of the Republic.

[03:24:32.267 --> 03:24:36.570]  Alright, I'm going to have to move quick because I said I was going to get into Jesse Ventura's new TV show.
[03:24:36.570 --> 03:24:38.892]  It's the most incredible episode I've ever seen.
[03:24:38.892 --> 03:24:41.494]  I'm still trying to digest it.
[03:24:41.494 --> 03:24:43.855]  Most incredible episode.
[03:24:43.855 --> 03:24:44.736]  That's coming up.
[03:24:44.736 --> 03:24:49.940]  World population reduction, the Malthusian eugenics, mindset of the world's ruling elite.
[03:24:49.940 --> 03:24:53.462]  Tarpley as a historian can back that up as well.
[03:24:53.462 --> 03:24:54.863]  Got some clips of that coming up.
[03:24:54.863 --> 03:24:57.805]  I said I would do the decade of tyranny in review.
[03:24:57.805 --> 03:25:00.527]  We're going to do that, but Webster dropped this bombshell.
[03:25:01.468 --> 03:25:18.405]  About how, in the off-year elections next year, and then two years out from that, three years, yeah, you're going to get exactly a general betray-us, not betray-us, total globalist neocon built up as this fake hero, along with a Mitt Romney.
[03:25:18.405 --> 03:25:21.848]  And remember, they represent the people that staged the big 9-11 attacks.
[03:25:22.549 --> 03:25:32.173]  They're going to come in and there will be such conservative mainline rebellion against Obama and his communist colorations, which are just foundation fronts.
[03:25:32.173 --> 03:25:39.376]  You know, Hillary's as communist as, as, as, as, as... I mean, it's a complete joke.
[03:25:39.376 --> 03:25:48.921]  And all of this is going on, and yes, you think Obama's bad, it's going to accelerate under the next right-wing person, who's not going to be right-wing at all.
[03:25:48.921 --> 03:25:50.301]  They're going to be a globalist.
[03:25:50.301 --> 03:25:51.702]  Webster, finish up with that.
[03:25:52.677 --> 03:26:02.986]  Well, again, the challenge is that if we don't want to be used by somebody, you've got to have some form of independent organization and some form of economic program.
[03:26:02.986 --> 03:26:05.288]  All the leftists are run by the foundations.
[03:26:05.288 --> 03:26:07.890]  All the right-wingers are run by the big foundations.
[03:26:07.890 --> 03:26:08.491]  Right.
[03:26:08.491 --> 03:26:10.893]  You have Scilla and Charybdis, right?
[03:26:10.893 --> 03:26:12.174]  The two things you want to avoid.
[03:26:14.108 --> 03:26:20.273]  In other words, there's Milton Friedman economics on the one side, and Malthusianism on the other.
[03:26:20.273 --> 03:26:23.215]  The green, extreme ecological global warming.
[03:26:23.215 --> 03:26:30.280]  But now, it's likely that the Democrats will lose at least one House of Congress, maybe both, in 2010.
[03:26:30.280 --> 03:26:35.484]  And then the Trumps come in, they stage a nuke attack, military dictatorships set up.
[03:26:35.484 --> 03:26:37.266]  We know the Pentagon's been selling that forever.
[03:26:37.726 --> 03:26:41.152]  Right, so the idea is that divided government would be a blessing.
[03:26:41.152 --> 03:26:43.315]  In other words, that's the one remedy in this system.
[03:26:43.315 --> 03:26:45.358]  We need gridlock, we need divided government.
[03:26:45.358 --> 03:26:47.401]  Let them fight each other to a standstill.
[03:26:47.401 --> 03:26:53.470]  But then for 2012, the Republicans, I don't think any of these existing Republicans could be
[03:26:53.510 --> 03:26:54.150]  Well, Bonapartism.
[03:27:21.749 --> 03:27:23.150]  Well, no, not Hitler.
[03:27:23.150 --> 03:27:25.633]  Hitler was a military.
[03:27:25.633 --> 03:27:26.595]  Not quite, not quite.
[03:27:26.595 --> 03:27:30.440]  You're not there yet because there's no mass movement yet.
[03:27:30.440 --> 03:27:31.781]  It would be growing.
[03:27:31.781 --> 03:27:33.884]  The difference would be von Hindenburg.
[03:27:33.884 --> 03:27:36.848]  Von Hindenburg is the hero of World War I, more or less.
[03:27:37.408 --> 03:27:45.494]  And he becomes the president of the Weimar Republic, and it's under his leadership that you get this extreme austerity.
[03:27:45.494 --> 03:27:58.103]  You get, in the case of von Hindenburg, the Bruning government, right, of 1930 to 1932, where they take away your unemployment insurance just at the moment when you have the highest unemployment that there's ever been.
[03:27:58.103 --> 03:28:02.626]  So von Hindenburg, I think, would be, this would be what Petraeus would do.
[03:28:03.346 --> 03:28:09.353]  And then the dimension beyond that gets us to something more like an actual Nazi movement, right?
[03:28:09.353 --> 03:28:16.802]  With all the overtones that would probably have here in terms of white supremacy and all sorts of other stuff, right?
[03:28:16.802 --> 03:28:19.265]  Violence in the streets, right?
[03:28:19.265 --> 03:28:21.807]  Assault sections, storm-up dialogue.
[03:28:21.807 --> 03:28:23.650]  Well now, I mean, it's just like Petraeus.
[03:28:24.932 --> 03:28:39.322]  Would be able to attack conservatives and libertarians, and they would say, oh, I'm turning my guns in, it's to the general, he's conservative, mmm, and it's just like, with left cover, Obama could start new wars, cut people's healthcare, and be praised as a loving commie.
[03:28:39.322 --> 03:28:54.612]  I mean, I would see under Petraeus them, I mean, we know that Tommy Franks was on the payroll to go around and give speeches saying, gee, I don't like it, but it's what we need, one more big terror attack, military dictatorship is what the people want.
[03:28:55.432 --> 03:29:01.455]  So we know that's what they've been selling, and yeah, Petraeus is just an absolute weasel demon.
[03:29:01.455 --> 03:29:04.156]  So I think that Petraeus, and then of course Mitt Romney.
[03:29:04.156 --> 03:29:11.779]  Mitt Romney, the hedge fund hyena, the asset stripper, the agent of Wall Street, who would take the economic side of it.
[03:29:11.779 --> 03:29:19.122]  And this would be a government that would not really lean on the Republican Party, which I think is in the process of disintegrating.
[03:29:19.122 --> 03:29:22.504]  It would be a government that would lean more explicitly on the Army.
[03:29:23.444 --> 03:29:24.185]  Thank you.
[03:29:24.185 --> 03:29:24.985]  Same to you Alex.
[03:29:24.985 --> 03:29:25.545]  Happy New Year.
[03:29:52.096 --> 03:29:56.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:56.000 --> 03:29:58.704]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.130 --> 03:30:05.131]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:30:05.131 --> 03:30:10.454]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:30:10.454 --> 03:30:12.515]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:30:12.515 --> 03:30:17.517]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:30:17.517 --> 03:30:18.697]  How much do you want?
[03:30:18.697 --> 03:30:19.818]  When do you want it?
[03:30:19.818 --> 03:30:21.699]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:30:21.699 --> 03:30:22.779]  When will you need it?
[03:30:22.779 --> 03:30:24.800]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:30:24.960 --> 03:30:26.302]  Will there be any food?
[03:30:26.302 --> 03:30:27.843]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:30:27.843 --> 03:30:33.110]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:30:33.110 --> 03:30:36.694]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:30:36.694 --> 03:30:40.158]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:30:40.498 --> 03:30:41.738]  How much will you need?
[03:30:41.738 --> 03:30:42.639]  We don't know.
[03:30:42.639 --> 03:30:43.739]  How much do you want?
[03:30:43.739 --> 03:30:44.659]  All you can get.
[03:30:44.659 --> 03:30:45.760]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:30:45.760 --> 03:30:48.801]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.

[03:30:50.582 --> 03:30:51.502]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:31:01.095 --> 03:31:06.402]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want you to eat.
[03:31:06.402 --> 03:31:10.948]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you sick?
[03:31:10.948 --> 03:31:13.211]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[03:31:13.211 --> 03:31:14.833]  You don't have to cooperate.
[03:31:14.833 --> 03:31:15.875]  There is a solution.
[03:31:16.095 --> 03:31:24.520]  Interhealth Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.

[03:32:00.998 --> 03:32:07.983]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator that produces pure drinking water right from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:07.983 --> 03:32:09.264]  No, this isn't science fiction.
[03:32:09.264 --> 03:32:10.065]  It's very real.
[03:32:10.065 --> 03:32:12.326]  I know because I use one every day in my own home.
[03:32:12.326 --> 03:32:13.967]  And it's available right now to you.
[03:32:13.967 --> 03:32:18.451]  Because you know exactly where your water comes from with Ecola Blue, you'll know what's in your cup.
[03:32:18.451 --> 03:32:21.013]  Clean, great tasting water without all the pollutants.
[03:32:21.013 --> 03:32:26.817]  Get your family off the grid today by ordering your own Ecola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator for your home or business.
[03:32:27.017 --> 03:32:31.803]  Their best-seller, the Ecolablue 28, produces up to 7 gallons of water every day.
[03:32:31.803 --> 03:32:34.646]  The Ecolablue 28 is easy to use and economical.
[03:32:34.646 --> 03:32:37.369]  Generate your own pure water from the humidity in the air.
[03:32:37.369 --> 03:32:44.538]  This system is free of chemicals and uses a multi-stage filtration system, including reverse osmosis, carbon filters, and ultraviolet lights.
[03:32:44.758 --> 03:32:46.119]  Hard to believe it is the last 26 minutes
[03:33:15.146 --> 03:33:17.928]  of radio that I'll be doing in 2009.
[03:33:17.928 --> 03:33:28.354]  I had quite the rant in the first hour, that's coming up in the rebroadcast if you missed it, where I laid out the cost and what we really face as a society.
[03:33:28.354 --> 03:33:40.461]  Alright, I want to get a little bit more into Jesse Ventura's Conspiracy Theory TV show because it continues to amaze me what they're letting on television and I still haven't gotten my mind around how this is on TV.
[03:33:40.461 --> 03:33:42.202]  Last night was so groundbreaking.
[03:33:42.662 --> 03:33:50.807]  They've exposed the whole Big Brother system, that global warming's a plan to shut down society and to rob the population for world government.
[03:33:50.807 --> 03:33:54.849]  Completely our side of the story, which is the truth.
[03:33:54.849 --> 03:33:58.351]  Last night's How the Elite are Poisoning Your Food, Your Water, Your Vaccines.
[03:34:00.568 --> 03:34:04.809]  Again, I recommended Estelin, I recommended Dr. Monteith, I also recommended Labo.
[03:34:04.809 --> 03:34:06.930]  I'm surprised she came up to the U.S.
[03:34:06.930 --> 03:34:08.210]  because she really did leave the U.S.
[03:34:08.210 --> 03:34:10.151]  She really thought this year was going to be the year.
[03:34:10.151 --> 03:34:15.412]  I saw it more as a drill with the vaccines to get everybody ready to go under federal control.
[03:34:15.412 --> 03:34:17.933]  And of course, they're debilitating things in the vaccines.
[03:34:17.933 --> 03:34:19.714]  That way people don't rise up and rebel.
[03:34:19.714 --> 03:34:22.834]  Because Jesse's like, well, if you do this, everybody starts dropping dead.
[03:34:22.834 --> 03:34:23.895]  They'll get mad.
[03:34:23.895 --> 03:34:25.715]  Not if it's soft kill.
[03:34:25.715 --> 03:34:28.016]  Not if it causes something debilitating that takes time.
[03:34:30.283 --> 03:34:35.447]  I thought it was a great program, but what was perfect was the global warming.
[03:34:35.447 --> 03:34:39.010]  But this is just so incredible to have this on air.
[03:34:39.010 --> 03:34:41.292]  It makes my head spin.
[03:34:41.292 --> 03:34:41.973]  That's coming up.
[03:34:41.973 --> 03:34:44.395]  I want to go over the decade of tyranny.
[03:34:44.395 --> 03:34:47.897]  An article by Alex Jones, Steve Watson, and Paul Watson.
[03:34:47.897 --> 03:34:51.901]  There's been a loss of basic freedoms has spurred a mass awakening.
[03:34:51.901 --> 03:34:56.424]  Next decade will be defined by the restoration of our liberties.
[03:34:57.321 --> 03:35:05.166]  Yeah, more than that, I think it's going to be defined by the Great Awakening and in the next decade will be the decision on the true future of humanity.
[03:35:06.380 --> 03:35:12.843]  But during the first nine years of the new millennium, we have been witness to a rapid erosion of freedom.
[03:35:12.843 --> 03:35:19.606]  Our basic liberties have been systematically deteriorating and diluted by a vast expansion of coordinated global tyranny.
[03:35:19.606 --> 03:35:20.766]  The decade is not over yet.
[03:35:20.766 --> 03:35:22.027]  There is still another year to go.
[03:35:22.027 --> 03:35:31.111]  However, given the mainstream media is obsessively compiling its own decades list, we felt it necessary to draw up our own
[03:35:32.151 --> 03:35:37.318]  And highlight the major events that have shaped the world we now live in and the future we face.
[03:35:37.318 --> 03:35:37.798]  Yeah.
[03:35:37.798 --> 03:35:43.065]  It's just been a decade of lies where they say the decade's over when there's a whole other year coming up.
[03:35:43.065 --> 03:35:47.611]  It's like they started the century a year early, the millennium a year early, the decade a year early.
[03:35:47.611 --> 03:35:48.272]  It's a joke!
[03:35:49.318 --> 03:36:03.309]  It is important to stress the fact that while we have indeed experienced a decade of tyranny, we have also seen a mass awakening, an expansion of knowledge, an exponential increase in opposition to the agenda we have come to know as the New World Order.
[03:36:03.309 --> 03:36:08.553]  Here is a chronological order following PrisonPlanet.com's defining moments of the decade.
[03:36:08.553 --> 03:36:10.594]  Of course, there have been countless others.
[03:36:10.594 --> 03:36:14.778]  Sunday and into next week, we'll talk about what you think the biggest stories
[03:36:15.518 --> 03:36:19.687]  Both over-reported, under-reported were, and what you think will happen in the next decade.
[03:36:19.687 --> 03:36:20.629]  That's coming up next week.
[03:36:20.629 --> 03:36:20.669]  2001-9-11
[03:36:30.187 --> 03:36:34.149]  9-1-1 was a precursor for everything that followed during the decade of tyranny.
[03:36:34.149 --> 03:36:38.871]  The immediate invasion of Afghanistan saw the U.S.
[03:36:38.871 --> 03:36:41.472]  go to war without formal declaration.
[03:36:41.472 --> 03:36:54.158]  The passage of the USA Patriot Act overnight, with members of Congress not even being afforded time to read it, paved the way for a decade of freedom-stripping government legislation that had nothing to do with even fighting the imaginary terror.
[03:36:54.798 --> 03:37:05.861]  The expansion of the phony war on terror as justification for big government, a domestic police state, and an interventionist foreign policy also stemmed directly from 9-11.
[03:37:05.861 --> 03:37:12.622]  We've now discovered under Homeland Security, the MIAC reports, and others that say this real system was set up for the American people.
[03:37:12.622 --> 03:37:13.682]  They know they're criminal.
[03:37:13.682 --> 03:37:15.543]  They know they're a bunch of crooks taking over.
[03:37:16.383 --> 03:37:21.868]  Over the past decade, we have ceaselessly exposed the lies behind 9-11.
[03:37:21.868 --> 03:37:32.299]  We have seen the 9-11 truth movement blossom from efforts by a select few individuals, myself who kicked it all off, to encompass the work of thousands, if not millions.
[03:37:33.558 --> 03:37:38.079]  Well, there is no doubt 9-11 is the decade of tyranny's defining moment.
[03:37:38.079 --> 03:37:45.081]  Exposing the truth behind it has also led to an equally influential awakening that is still ongoing.
[03:37:45.081 --> 03:37:48.382]  I would say accelerating.
[03:37:48.382 --> 03:37:50.903]  2002, the creation of the Department of Homeland Security.
[03:37:50.903 --> 03:37:54.444]  The fallout of 9-11 led to the realignment of power in the U.S.
[03:37:54.444 --> 03:38:02.947]  with the shadow government stepping out of the open and implementing elements of a long-term agenda to subvert constitutional freedom and bring the states under total federal control.
[03:38:03.547 --> 03:38:11.169]  After the passage of the Patriot Act in late 2001, the next major step towards tyranny came with the expansion of federal government through the creation of DHS.
[03:38:11.169 --> 03:38:24.013]  The DHS has played the role of the domestic police state enforcer agency, encompassing every major law enforcement agency in the nation and 30 plus other federal agencies under one single office.
[03:38:24.013 --> 03:38:28.935]  Now being handed over to international Interpol control and under the Israelis as well.
[03:38:30.114 --> 03:38:39.261]  With multiple subsequent reports and video productions fingering the American people as potential terrorists, the Orwellian-titled agency has proven to be
[03:38:40.953 --> 03:38:51.420]  And proven it had nothing to do with security and everything to do with limiting the freedoms of the people all over the country and securing the banking takeover that was to come.
[03:38:51.420 --> 03:38:57.023]  2003 invasion of Iraq, the move to start the dominoes for World War III.
[03:38:57.023 --> 03:39:02.927]  In March of 2003, the invasion of Iraq was a war based on a mountain of lies and deceit.
[03:39:02.927 --> 03:39:07.950]  And yet, at the time, the public swallowed the propaganda with wanton bloodlust
[03:39:08.971 --> 03:39:19.094]  The constant invocation of the link between 9-11 and Saddam Hussein was repeatedly debunked before the war even began and after the invasion, but of course the war was set.
[03:39:19.094 --> 03:39:25.477]  The invasion was an illegal attack based on a wholly contrived pretext and the war was not approved by Congress.
[03:39:25.477 --> 03:39:26.417]  This set of
[03:39:27.257 --> 03:39:32.959]  Precedent for unconstitutional global preemptive strikes in the name of the war on terror.
[03:39:32.959 --> 03:39:44.761]  Conservative estimates put the death toll and the result of the invasion around 655,000, but this number is far higher when the previous year's sanctions are taken into account.
[03:39:44.761 --> 03:39:45.402]  Upon U.S.
[03:39:45.402 --> 03:39:54.104]  occupation of the country, Iraq was turned into one giant gulag with hundreds of thousands detained and held in internment camps for the most menial offenses.
[03:39:54.904 --> 03:39:57.288]  The real number is about a million and a half dead.
[03:39:57.288 --> 03:40:08.063]  The occupation of Iraq provided the opportunity to build hundreds of military bases to be used to launch pad for future preemptive wars in the key geopolitical region of the Middle East.
[03:40:08.063 --> 03:40:10.787]  The Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal.
[03:40:11.758 --> 03:40:18.424]  Of course, also came out the Army's own report admitting children were raped in front of their parents at other camps.
[03:40:18.424 --> 03:40:21.407]  People were tortured to death for fake confessions.
[03:40:21.407 --> 03:40:22.909]  It was also meant to test U.S.
[03:40:22.909 --> 03:40:29.395]  forces and find people who liked torture who could be moved then to be commanders of black sites all over the world.
[03:40:31.192 --> 03:40:34.073]  And now rendition has been expanded under Obama, I would add.
[03:40:34.073 --> 03:40:36.735]  Of course, all the famous things that happened there.
[03:40:36.735 --> 03:40:49.201]  Hurricane Katrina fallout, where FEMA ordered a stand-down and that no aid be delivered so that FEMA could then claim that they'd screwed up and needed even more unlimited power and control and funding.
[03:40:49.201 --> 03:40:51.822]  And so that's really what went on there with Katrina.
[03:40:53.148 --> 03:41:00.570]  We had the liquid bomb scams of 2006, which led to tighter restrictions on airlines.
[03:41:00.570 --> 03:41:03.490]  Now we've had the underwear bomber to be used as the same.
[03:41:03.490 --> 03:41:13.792]  Now the TSA announces they're going on the streets, the buses, the trains of America, federalizing your police, training you that you have less rights than someone in Stalinist Russia.
[03:41:13.792 --> 03:41:17.753]  2007, the rise of the Ron Paul revolution, the rise of the resistance.
[03:41:17.753 --> 03:41:22.074]  People begin to learn the Federal Reserve is the real government and is truly running the society.
[03:41:24.502 --> 03:41:28.445]  2008, the bankers carry out the banking heist.
[03:41:28.445 --> 03:41:29.926]  The central banks that own the U.S.
[03:41:29.926 --> 03:41:37.533]  government set the course for the most egregious looting of American public in history with the passage of the TARP bailout legislation.
[03:41:37.533 --> 03:41:43.818]  Of course, we could have the Animal ID Premise Society Act taking over the farms, the ranches, the threat integration centers being set up.
[03:41:45.390 --> 03:41:57.575]  The bailout merely increased the severity of the financial downturn and allowed the same elite to exploit the crisis in the pretext of centralizing control of the world economic system and creating a new world order and a single global currency under the SDRs.
[03:41:57.575 --> 03:42:14.182]  Henry Paulson, with the chief architect of the bailout and the man who committed the financial terrorism by threatening Congress with martial law and food riots, give folks a close shot of this, if they didn't pass the initial TARP package, brazenly pocketed $200 million in Goldman Sachs profits tax-free for himself.
[03:42:15.558 --> 03:42:29.627]  While handing out billions in ill-gotten gains to bankster buddies after he pulled a bait-and-switch by changing the entire focus of the bailout from buying up toxic debt to giving money directly to financial institutions.
[03:42:29.627 --> 03:42:30.968]  Over $24 trillion.
[03:42:30.968 --> 03:42:32.028]  Watson has a low number.
[03:42:32.028 --> 03:42:33.569]  It's $23.7 trillion and then another $4.5 trillion.
[03:42:39.119 --> 03:42:42.641]  Acceleration of world government in 2009.
[03:42:42.641 --> 03:43:02.555]  2009 represents the year that the agenda for world government was both openly announced and the acceleration of its implementation reached breakneck speed as globalists exploited both the engineered financial crisis and the contrived global warming scam to move to finalize total dictatorial control over the planet.
[03:43:02.555 --> 03:43:05.737]  In October, New York Times editorial, We Can Do It,
[03:43:06.684 --> 03:43:15.110]  Ban Ki-moon wrote that the efforts to impose restrictions on CO2 emissions must include an equitable global governance structure.
[03:43:15.110 --> 03:43:24.338]  The new EU President, Herman Van Rompuy, said in December press conference that the Copenhagen conference was the first step towards global government and management of our planet.
[03:43:24.338 --> 03:43:26.900]  Similarly, Al Gore in a speech earlier this year
[03:43:28.240 --> 03:43:33.484]  So that attempts to regulate CO2 emissions would be driven through global governance and global agreements.
[03:43:33.484 --> 03:43:42.791]  Although it failed to ram through a large portion of the global government agenda, the Copenhagen Agreement laid out the foundation for the introduction of a global transaction tax to be paid to private banks.
[03:43:42.791 --> 03:43:49.517]  But again, it was a huge victory, the equivalent of Washington at Trenton, when we defeated the main conference.
[03:43:50.413 --> 03:43:52.173]  And when those emails got leaked.
[03:43:52.173 --> 03:43:53.774]  So, major victory.
[03:43:53.774 --> 03:43:56.054]  Showing people we can have victories.
[03:43:56.054 --> 03:43:58.795]  Ahead, we see the decade of freedom.
[03:43:58.795 --> 03:44:03.396]  The battle between tyranny and freedom is a long-term game of brinksmanship.
[03:44:03.396 --> 03:44:08.457]  However, as we move into 2010, we are reaching a critical time in modern history.
[03:44:08.457 --> 03:44:18.600]  Humanity must decide whether to engage in battle for freedom or accept the future under the rule of tyranny.
[03:44:20.689 --> 03:44:24.991]  It's got a bibliography at the bottom of all the documentation.
[03:44:24.991 --> 03:44:26.191]  I kind of hurried through that.
[03:44:26.191 --> 03:44:27.372]  I'm not a very good newsreader.
[03:44:27.372 --> 03:44:38.556]  Three and a half hours into the show, I get a bit tired, but... We'll have your decade of tyranny in review, but also your decade of awakening.
[03:44:38.556 --> 03:44:42.078]  Next week, a lot of open phones and some other very informative guests.
[03:44:45.819 --> 03:44:48.461]  I'm going to try to review last night's show with Ventura.
[03:44:48.461 --> 03:44:54.805]  I noticed when I took calls, almost every call brought up the TV show.
[03:44:54.805 --> 03:45:02.190]  And callers brought up how almost every call on C-SPAN is talking about the New World Order, staged terror, left-right paradigm, awakening.
[03:45:02.190 --> 03:45:08.234]  I mean, it's... The globalists are going to strike back, though.
[03:45:08.234 --> 03:45:10.135]  I really do think they're going to nuke cities.
[03:45:10.135 --> 03:45:12.516]  They're going to do... I mean, you thought 9-11 was big.
[03:45:12.516 --> 03:45:14.458]  This underwear bomber stuff is just a test.
[03:45:15.606 --> 03:45:23.873]  Folks, we better expose these terrorists, we better expose these foreign bankers, or it's just... And all of you fools serving the system, you better grow up.
[03:45:23.873 --> 03:45:32.040]  I mean, this is... I mean, we've got Hillary Clinton's own treatise where she admits she loves communism and covertly taking over the government.
[03:45:32.040 --> 03:45:34.642]  The bankers fund the communists.
[03:45:34.642 --> 03:45:39.066]  They tell you when they rob you at gunpoint and put you in a labor camp that it's for the people.
[03:45:39.066 --> 03:45:40.107]  It's slavery.
[03:45:40.107 --> 03:45:42.109]  It has nothing to do with that, you foolish leftists.
[03:45:43.387 --> 03:45:50.652]  And all you right-wingers that think war and tyranny and checkpoints are conservative, wake up, morons!
[03:45:50.652 --> 03:45:52.753]  You're controlled by the left-right paradigm!
[03:45:52.753 --> 03:46:09.484]  And if you don't wake up now and say no to all of this, corporatism, crony capitalism, monopoly capitalism, the police state, big government, corporate welfare, all of it, and if you leftists don't figure out that any big government program is going to be a rip-off,
[03:46:10.796 --> 03:46:12.537]  Don't you understand that?
[03:46:12.537 --> 03:46:14.717]  Of course the banker bailout was a rip-off.
[03:46:14.717 --> 03:46:18.399]  Of course the healthcare plan they haven't passed yet is a rip-off.
[03:46:18.399 --> 03:46:21.060]  Of course the left is freaking out now.
[03:46:21.060 --> 03:46:23.561]  You thought you were going to get to rob some rich people.
[03:46:23.561 --> 03:46:25.521]  The rich people wrote the stinking thing.
[03:46:25.521 --> 03:46:26.742]  They run the government.
[03:46:26.742 --> 03:46:29.463]  They're going to be taking more out of your blue-collar paycheck, you fool!
[03:46:34.488 --> 03:46:36.209]  How is this being allowed to air?
[03:46:36.209 --> 03:46:43.573]  Because everybody's waking up to the New World Order, they put it in an entertainment format, and the establishment just thinks it'll further condition people.
[03:46:43.573 --> 03:46:52.798]  That's even what Ventura thinks, but it's waking people up, you have an open discussion of world government, an open discussion of how they plan to exterminate you.
[03:46:52.798 --> 03:46:56.900]  I can't believe this aired last night.
[03:46:56.900 --> 03:46:59.842]  Again, I recommended Monti, all the major people interviewed here.
[03:47:01.821 --> 03:47:07.884]  I knew they were preparing for martial law earlier in the year, but we always stop them from fully implementing.
[03:47:07.884 --> 03:47:12.687]  So they got their vaccine, millions made, they're fear-mongering through.
[03:47:12.687 --> 03:47:15.268]  We knew they were getting ready for flu hype in January.
[03:47:15.268 --> 03:47:17.789]  I went on air and said, look for something big with the flu.
[03:47:17.789 --> 03:47:21.051]  I don't know if it's going to be as big as the feds are teaching local counties.
[03:47:21.051 --> 03:47:22.831]  They're saying millions dead per state.
[03:47:22.831 --> 03:47:23.812]  That's probably bull.
[03:47:25.430 --> 03:47:35.138]  But what is in the vaccine we've proven does debilitate people as part of a soft kill program and does debilitate you over time.
[03:47:35.138 --> 03:47:37.280]  That's the only part I disagree with is with Dr. Labo.
[03:47:37.280 --> 03:47:39.222]  She says, oh yes, it'll kill a bunch of people in the open.
[03:47:39.222 --> 03:47:40.283]  There'll be a rebellion.
[03:47:40.283 --> 03:47:43.846]  And I told her on air months ago, I said, no, you watch.
[03:47:45.529 --> 03:47:47.710]  It's gonna be debilitating over a long period of time.
[03:47:47.710 --> 03:47:50.770]  Sure, some will die, and some have, and some will get sick.
[03:47:50.770 --> 03:47:53.871]  So that's the only part of the show I don't like.
[03:47:53.871 --> 03:47:56.572]  But overall, she did a great job in it as well.
[03:47:56.572 --> 03:47:58.712]  But I think that's the one that I recommended.
[03:47:58.712 --> 03:47:59.993]  Dr. Monteith, I recommended.
[03:47:59.993 --> 03:48:02.853]  I was the main consultant on this show.
[03:48:02.853 --> 03:48:06.734]  It's just a great program, and I'm really honored to be involved with it.
[03:48:06.734 --> 03:48:08.335]  Let's go to one of the clips now.
[03:48:08.335 --> 03:48:10.195]  Go ahead and roll this clip.
[03:48:13.280 --> 03:48:17.241]  Alex Jones is a leading conspiracy expert and Bilderberg foe.
[03:48:17.241 --> 03:48:27.184]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're here in Canada today to stand up against the Bilderberg group that is attempting to get rid of the sovereignty of the United States.
[03:48:27.184 --> 03:48:30.644]  And he's definitely made his presence known at the Bilderberg meetings.
[03:48:30.644 --> 03:48:32.485]  We're not your slaves!
[03:48:32.485 --> 03:48:34.185]  We don't belong to you!
[03:48:34.185 --> 03:48:37.106]  Your New World Order will fall!
[03:48:37.106 --> 03:48:39.947]  Jones adds a terrifying twist to the investigation.
[03:48:45.425 --> 03:48:48.107]  Alex, why are we meeting here?
[03:48:48.107 --> 03:48:54.071]  Because the information I want to talk to you about is important, and I wanted to talk to you privately.
[03:48:54.071 --> 03:48:55.732]  Well, this is certainly private.
[03:48:55.732 --> 03:48:56.732]  What do you got for me?
[03:48:56.732 --> 03:48:57.493]  The big kahuna.
[03:49:00.404 --> 03:49:01.344]  Which is?
[03:49:01.344 --> 03:49:07.646]  It's the science of controlling populations and controlling information and becoming the mapmakers of the mind.
[03:49:07.646 --> 03:49:13.347]  They lay out, through the culture, through their different media arms, the system and the direction they want to go.
[03:49:13.347 --> 03:49:17.828]  So basically, the Bilderberg Group meeting is like a massive mafia commission meeting.
[03:49:17.828 --> 03:49:19.389]  They're already running their different enterprises.
[03:49:19.389 --> 03:49:25.370]  They're now meeting once a year to make major decisions or to tweak or change their overall program.
[03:49:25.370 --> 03:49:27.091]  So it's basically like the Godfather.
[03:49:27.751 --> 03:49:28.031]  Yes.
[03:49:28.031 --> 03:49:32.836]  The big scene in The Godfather where all the leaders of the families were brought together.
[03:49:32.836 --> 03:49:36.060]  There was a problem and they solved it that day if we go to the movies.
[03:49:36.060 --> 03:49:37.021]  That's exactly.
[03:49:37.021 --> 03:49:46.791]  They operate by covert means and the policy is a planetary government to carry out the extermination, the murder of at least 80% of the world's population.
[03:49:53.257 --> 03:49:54.860]  And they're on record saying they're doing it.
[03:49:54.860 --> 03:49:58.988]  They're so arrogant, they think the public's too stupid to find out what they're doing.
[03:49:58.988 --> 03:50:00.410]  They want you dead, Governor.
[03:50:01.593 --> 03:50:02.093]  Why?
[03:50:02.093 --> 03:50:05.834]  It is the elite trying to get a hedge on the future.
[03:50:05.834 --> 03:50:16.237]  Total control freaks wanting to control mankind's destiny and only let their blood and their elite families go forward into the future with the life extension technologies.
[03:50:16.237 --> 03:50:23.119]  Jones is only the latest authority to say the elitists want to get the population down to a so-called manageable level.
[03:50:24.019 --> 03:50:27.762]  He's the first to give a hint of how they might do it.
[03:50:27.762 --> 03:50:31.144]  That's the debate happening right now while we sit here talking.
[03:50:31.144 --> 03:50:41.733]  Are they going to go with soft kill in the water or do they go ahead and go with the hardcore mega death, mega kill and kill four and a half billion people at least?
[03:50:41.733 --> 03:50:44.034]  This is way more urgent than I even thought.
[03:50:44.034 --> 03:50:52.601]  I talked to Alex Jones and he told me one of the main objectives of the Bilderbergs, get this, depopulation of the world.
[03:50:54.528 --> 03:50:56.809]  Cutting down the masses.
[03:50:56.809 --> 03:50:58.610]  And how does he say they're going to do it?
[03:50:58.610 --> 03:50:59.791]  All right.
[03:50:59.791 --> 03:51:03.533]  We'll be right back.
[03:51:03.533 --> 03:51:05.554]  Remain in your houses.
[03:51:05.554 --> 03:51:11.317]  The President of the United States has declared martial law under Executive Order 11004.
[03:51:11.317 --> 03:51:12.678]  Will they do it?
[03:51:12.678 --> 03:51:15.299]  Will they pull the trigger this time?
[03:51:15.299 --> 03:51:21.763]  We all pray they stand down, but an engineered crisis seems more likely with each passing day.
[03:51:21.763 --> 03:51:23.004]  Think it can't happen here?
[03:51:23.944 --> 03:51:28.227]  Executive Order 10-990 locks down all highways.
[03:51:28.227 --> 03:51:33.110]  Executive Order 10-995 seizes control of all media outlets.
[03:51:33.110 --> 03:51:38.013]  Executive Order 10-998 controls all farms and food supplies.
[03:51:38.013 --> 03:51:42.836]  All these executive orders are now cocked, loaded, and waiting for the right crisis.
[03:51:43.756 --> 03:51:52.160]  So if you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America, or have questions about how to survive it, go to MartialLawSurvival.com.
[03:51:52.160 --> 03:51:54.661]  That's MartialLawSurvival.com.

[03:52:03.064 --> 03:52:07.046]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[03:52:07.046 --> 03:52:10.327]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[03:52:10.327 --> 03:52:11.728]  As we're finishing off this agenda,
[03:52:12.449 --> 03:52:15.872]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[03:52:15.872 --> 03:52:21.518]  Tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[03:52:21.518 --> 03:52:27.063]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[03:52:27.063 --> 03:52:36.692]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel, hell-bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[03:52:36.792 --> 03:52:39.154]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[03:52:39.154 --> 03:52:40.736]  They're asking for more matches!
[03:52:40.736 --> 03:52:43.198]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[03:52:43.198 --> 03:52:45.321]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[03:52:45.321 --> 03:52:50.486]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[03:52:50.486 --> 03:52:59.595]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[03:54:03.865 --> 03:54:21.876]  I just want to promise the listeners that in the next year, you're going to see an even greater commitment from me to be more focused, more professional, more serious, more effective against the New World Order.
[03:54:23.114 --> 03:54:25.375]  That's not saying we haven't done a great job in the last year.
[03:54:25.375 --> 03:54:29.697]  I want to salute my crew for the fabulous job they've done.
[03:54:29.697 --> 03:54:37.881]  And I want to salute all of you, the listeners, for spreading the word about the radio show, the free podcasts, the films, everything.
[03:54:37.881 --> 03:54:39.742]  We are having a great effect.
[03:54:39.742 --> 03:54:42.283]  You're not going to defeat this tyranny overnight.
[03:54:42.283 --> 03:54:44.664]  But we are becoming the mainstream.
[03:54:44.664 --> 03:54:52.008]  And the system is in trouble and everyone worldwide is sick of the offshore corporations robbing everyone.
[03:54:52.970 --> 03:54:54.651]  And so they're setting up a U.N.
[03:54:54.651 --> 03:55:04.174]  with a world government and a world army to make everyone do what they want so they can carry out illegitimate crimes against us and sterilize us.
[03:55:04.174 --> 03:55:06.335]  And people aren't putting up with it.
[03:55:06.335 --> 03:55:10.077]  That's why suddenly there's magazines and articles everywhere I go.
[03:55:10.077 --> 03:55:12.057]  Oh, everyone's getting sterilized.
[03:55:12.057 --> 03:55:12.938]  We don't know why.
[03:55:12.938 --> 03:55:14.538]  It's so wonderful.
[03:55:14.538 --> 03:55:15.959]  Oh, the fertility's falling.
[03:55:15.959 --> 03:55:16.699]  It's so good.
[03:55:16.699 --> 03:55:18.380]  Oh, one-child policies.
[03:55:18.380 --> 03:55:21.181]  Even if you can have a kid, we should tax you if you do.
[03:55:21.721 --> 03:55:23.202]  Not unless you have more than one!
[03:55:23.202 --> 03:55:28.808]  This stuff's real, people!
[03:55:28.808 --> 03:55:35.053]  And if you've been in denial out there and laughed at us five years ago talking about world government, you've now heard it on the news.
[03:55:35.053 --> 03:55:37.736]  There's no more time to suck your thumb and play games.
[03:55:37.736 --> 03:55:39.998]  Look at Monteith talking to them on the Ventura Show.
[03:55:39.998 --> 03:55:41.239]  Here's a clip.
[03:55:41.239 --> 03:55:43.921]  It's all up on Infowars.com if you want to watch the whole thing.
[03:55:43.921 --> 03:55:44.222]  Here it is.
[03:55:48.837 --> 03:55:52.502]  Now one of those sources has summoned the governor.
[03:55:52.502 --> 03:55:55.766]  Alex Jones says he knows how they plan to depopulate.
[03:56:02.023 --> 03:56:03.764]  Alex, you sounded urgent.
[03:56:03.764 --> 03:56:12.569]  There's an entire agenda afoot to force the population to undergo different type of medical treatments, namely vaccines.
[03:56:12.569 --> 03:56:20.234]  We're seeing a medical tyranny being set up, not just in the United States, but worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization.
[03:56:20.234 --> 03:56:21.355]  Who's behind all this?
[03:56:21.775 --> 03:56:22.515]  Okay, so that's a little forte.
[03:56:50.246 --> 03:56:51.267]  There's a lot of these clips.
[03:56:51.267 --> 03:56:52.668]  Here's another random clip.
[03:56:52.668 --> 03:56:53.928]  Let's go to clip three.
[03:56:53.928 --> 03:56:56.170]  I think this is Monteith, but whatever.
[03:56:56.170 --> 03:56:57.450]  You can watch it on TruTV.
[03:56:57.450 --> 03:57:00.232]  It'll re-air next week before the latest episode.
[03:57:00.232 --> 03:57:01.733]  8 p.m.
[03:57:01.733 --> 03:57:04.594]  channel at 10 p.m.
[03:57:04.594 --> 03:57:05.555]  Eastern, 9 p.m.
[03:57:05.555 --> 03:57:07.876]  Central, whatever your channel is.
[03:57:07.876 --> 03:57:09.277]  And here's another clip.
[03:57:09.277 --> 03:57:10.338]  Just go ahead and play it then.
[03:57:10.338 --> 03:57:10.558]  Hell.
[03:57:10.558 --> 03:57:14.940]  We're almost... Doctor, how can you say this stuff?
[03:57:14.940 --> 03:57:15.901]  Let me tell you a story.
[03:57:16.798 --> 03:57:25.330]  In 2003, I had a patient in my drug-free medical practice who was a head of state.
[03:57:25.330 --> 03:57:31.699]  And one day, she said, you know, it's almost time for the great culling to begin.
[03:57:31.699 --> 03:57:32.501]  The what?
[03:57:33.021 --> 03:57:33.922]  That's what I said.
[03:57:33.922 --> 03:57:35.023]  The what?
[03:57:35.023 --> 03:57:36.965]  She said the great culling.
[03:57:36.965 --> 03:57:39.567]  C-U-L-L-I-N-G.
[03:57:39.567 --> 03:57:40.888]  When you thin the herd.
[03:57:40.888 --> 03:57:43.211]  I said, what are you talking about?
[03:57:43.211 --> 03:57:47.455]  She said, it's almost time for the useless eaters.
[03:57:48.484 --> 03:57:49.685]  To be cold.
[03:57:49.685 --> 03:57:58.115]  And she said, those are the people who are consuming our non-renewable natural resources.
[03:57:58.115 --> 03:58:01.238]  I said, who are the people who make this decision?
[03:58:01.238 --> 03:58:04.142]  She said, we, the aristocrats.
[03:58:04.602 --> 03:58:11.644]  This person you talk to, you're bound because you're a physician and there's the relationship that you can't talk.
[03:58:11.644 --> 03:58:13.864]  Is this person a member of the Bilderbergs?
[03:58:13.864 --> 03:58:15.505]  She is not Queen Beatrice.
[03:58:15.505 --> 03:58:17.145]  She is not the Queen of England.
[03:58:17.145 --> 03:58:18.946]  She is not Henry Kissinger.
[03:58:18.946 --> 03:58:27.708]  But she certainly presented herself as a member of that power elite and she certainly was a head of state.
[03:58:29.286 --> 03:58:33.148]  The Bilderbergers are much talked about.
[03:58:33.148 --> 03:58:34.848]  Folks, we're out of time.
[03:58:34.848 --> 03:58:36.069]  Happy New Year.
[03:58:36.069 --> 03:58:37.369]  Let's stand up for humanity.
[03:58:37.369 --> 03:58:38.069]  Let's wake up.
[03:58:38.069 --> 03:58:39.370]  Let's take action.
[03:58:39.370 --> 03:58:40.850]  Retransmission starts now.
[03:58:40.850 --> 03:58:41.211]  See you 2010.
[03:58:41.211 --> 03:58:47.393]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[03:58:47.393 --> 03:58:49.174]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.547 --> 03:58:56.110]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:56.110 --> 03:58:57.011]  Number one.
[03:58:57.011 --> 03:59:00.434]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:59:00.434 --> 03:59:01.294]  Number two.
[03:59:01.294 --> 03:59:06.198]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:06.198 --> 03:59:06.939]  It's true.
[03:59:06.939 --> 03:59:11.802]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.802 --> 03:59:12.343]  Number three.
[03:59:12.623 --> 03:59:16.205]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:16.205 --> 03:59:20.928]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:20.928 --> 03:59:23.690]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.690 --> 03:59:28.152]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:28.152 --> 03:59:32.295]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:32.295 --> 03:59:37.058]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:59:37.358 --> 03:59:41.522]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:59:41.522 --> 03:59:43.303]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
