[00:00.000 --> 00:12.360]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.360 --> 00:40.680]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:40.680 --> 00:51.040]  well ladies and gentlemen here we are the final broadcast of the year 2009 it
[00:51.040 --> 00:56.160]  came and went with a flash a twinkling of an eye just like our lives will you
[00:56.160 --> 01:00.440]  ever had a birthday party or a trip coming up it's six months away it feels
[01:00.440 --> 01:06.040]  like forever but before you know it the trip has come and gone the party has
[01:06.040 --> 01:11.440]  come and gone just like this year went by so quickly our lives will go by just
[01:11.440 --> 01:17.880]  as fast you'll be there in your deathbed before you know it or you'll be on
[01:17.880 --> 01:26.760]  the expressway watching that overturn 18-wheeler carrying natural gas exploding
[01:26.760 --> 01:33.120]  in a flash of flame in front of you the millisecond before you meet your maker
[01:33.120 --> 01:38.120]  before you know it you'll be out there playing golf and your left arm will go
[01:38.120 --> 01:42.240]  numb you'll feel a terrible pain you'll jolt back slamming your head into the
[01:42.240 --> 01:50.920]  turf as your spirit leaves your body we need to learn to enjoy life and to
[01:50.920 --> 01:55.120]  savor it and to appreciate it to appreciate all the beauty all the
[01:55.120 --> 01:59.920]  wonderment all the majesty all the love all the innocence everything that is
[01:59.920 --> 02:06.600]  good in life because just as this year 2009 has sped past us just as a rare
[02:06.600 --> 02:15.440]  blue moon visits this final day of the year 2009 the blue moon of death will
[02:15.440 --> 02:21.040]  come to all of our lives before we know it because the truth is ladies and
[02:21.040 --> 02:28.920]  gentlemen tens of billions of people who loved and lived and fought and
[02:28.920 --> 02:34.920]  struggled and built who had passions who had feuds they've all come and gone
[02:34.920 --> 02:44.840]  before us and one day soon we will join them in eternity but for now we're alive
[02:44.840 --> 02:52.080]  on this plane of existence spinning through space on a planet covered with
[02:52.080 --> 03:02.240]  deep blue oceans high snow-capped mountains deep green forest birds in the
[03:02.240 --> 03:12.360]  sky the ribbon in that girl's hair everything that is life
[03:12.360 --> 03:19.600]  transitory so love your husband love your wife love your father love your
[03:19.600 --> 03:30.960]  mother forgive those who have unconsciously trespassed against you but
[03:30.960 --> 03:35.440]  at the same time stop spending all your time on issues of little or no
[03:35.440 --> 03:41.920]  significance that have been set before you as distractions from what life is
[03:41.920 --> 03:49.000]  really all about doesn't matter who wins the big 12 in football it doesn't
[03:49.000 --> 03:55.120]  matter how many mistresses Tiger Woods has what matters is we have a wicked
[03:55.120 --> 04:01.760]  controlling scientific dictatorship establishing world governance for the
[04:01.760 --> 04:06.720]  express purpose of ushering in an electronic straightjacket a cashless
[04:06.720 --> 04:13.280]  society technological enslavement grid known as the New World Order we have a
[04:13.280 --> 04:16.920]  group of our fellow humans who believe they are the predator class and is
[04:16.920 --> 04:24.600]  their right as kings to feed on free humanity and to dumb us down and to
[04:24.600 --> 04:30.280]  control our destiny because they want to control the destiny of this species they
[04:30.280 --> 04:35.880]  know that you must have no control over your destiny and that is a great crime I
[04:35.880 --> 04:41.280]  believe in free will and I believe that they all men and women should control
[04:41.280 --> 04:45.040]  their destiny and be captains of their destiny as long as they don't hurt
[04:45.040 --> 04:50.040]  others when they attempt to enslave others they become my mortal and
[04:50.040 --> 04:54.520]  eternal enemy and as Thomas Jefferson said I have sworn on the altar of God

[08:19.960 --> 08:33.640]  Alex Jones
[08:36.640 --> 08:40.640]  Alex Jones is a leading conspiracy expert and Bilderberg foe
[08:40.640 --> 08:49.640]  Ladies and gentlemen we're here in Canada today to stand up against the Bilderberg group that is attempting to get rid of the sovereignty of the United States
[08:49.640 --> 08:55.760]  and he's definitely made his presence known at the Bilderberg meetings
[08:59.600 --> 09:05.000]  Jones as a terrifying twist to the investigation
[09:07.760 --> 09:13.280]  Alex why we meet in here because the information I want to talk to you about
[09:13.280 --> 09:18.760]  is important and I wanted to talk to you privately well this is certainly private
[09:18.760 --> 09:22.760]  what do you got for me the big
[09:22.960 --> 09:29.120]  which is it's the science of controlling population throughout the show today I'm
[09:29.120 --> 09:34.440]  gonna play a clip of Dr. Stan Montee in Jesse Ventura secret society special
[09:34.440 --> 09:41.000]  Dr. Stan Montee I'm gonna play clips of David Ike from the special I'm gonna
[09:41.000 --> 09:49.040]  play clips from Dr. Rima Lebo from the special the entire special is being
[09:49.040 --> 09:55.360]  posted in the next hour so up at info wars.com and in a blurb article that
[09:55.360 --> 10:03.800]  Aaron Dykes is putting together right now we of course are gonna have a year in
[10:03.800 --> 10:11.840]  review 2009 today we will have decade in review again I can't put out this
[10:11.840 --> 10:17.880]  info consciously doesn't mean we don't make mistakes but it is not the end of
[10:17.880 --> 10:22.000]  the decade as the media is saying the new millennium did not start the new
[10:22.000 --> 10:28.040]  decade did not start the new century did not start in 2000 January 1st 2000
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.640]  that's just not true January 1st 2001 but the media and the public have been
[10:33.640 --> 10:40.120]  saying since 98 that the new millennium began in 2000 and so we will review the
[10:40.120 --> 10:45.240]  decade and review the decade of lies corruption big brother the language
[10:45.240 --> 10:49.800]  being destroyed open lies being practiced like never before the 9-11
[10:49.800 --> 10:56.920]  lie I mean they claimed they killed different Alcatel leaders some of them
[10:56.920 --> 11:04.160]  15 20 times a piece and they would never rescind the last time they killed him and
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.480]  they would claim they captured chemical Ali 3 4 5 times then claim they killed
[11:08.480 --> 11:12.360]  him again and then captured him again I mean it's in they claim that this is the
[11:12.360 --> 11:17.480]  end of the decade tonight at midnight in your time zone it's not there's a whole
[11:17.480 --> 11:22.360]  another year left they might come out next week and say there's 497 days in a
[11:22.360 --> 11:29.080]  year there's 365 that's what it takes for the planet to orbit around the Sun but
[11:29.080 --> 11:34.760]  they might just say there's 5,000 days in a year when the Illuminati took over
[11:34.760 --> 11:40.360]  France and the French Revolution they went to a 10-day and they changed it to
[11:40.360 --> 11:49.560]  a 9-day week what a 50-something day month I mean they're into that they're
[11:49.560 --> 11:53.160]  into playing God they're into genetic engineering they're into weather
[11:53.160 --> 12:00.240]  manipulation the globalists like to play God so how do you have a decade in
[12:00.240 --> 12:03.720]  review when it's not a decade well whatever we're we're gonna look at the
[12:03.720 --> 12:10.760]  last nine years okay or since they're trying to change the common era to
[12:10.760 --> 12:18.240]  decades and and and centuries and Millennium's ending a year before they
[12:18.240 --> 12:24.040]  really do we'll just look at the see I'm starting to obsess over this it
[12:24.040 --> 12:29.200]  doesn't matter but it does matter that just everything is a fraud they distort
[12:29.200 --> 12:35.400]  everything to where you can't even find out what the truth is anymore I don't
[12:35.400 --> 12:41.760]  know what to think of last night's TV show it is the episode that I feature
[12:41.760 --> 12:45.200]  most heavily in I'm the only person that comes back repeatedly in different
[12:45.200 --> 12:48.760]  episodes and I'm told if it gets picked up again I'm gonna be an even bigger
[12:48.760 --> 12:53.040]  part of the show which I'm very honored to be the only person other than Jesse
[12:53.040 --> 12:58.320]  Ventura that's a repeat visitor to Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory and I
[12:58.320 --> 13:01.800]  know that the crew have become completely convinced of the new world order
[13:01.800 --> 13:08.320]  while making the film I know Time Warner has had their fingers somewhat in it and
[13:08.320 --> 13:12.360]  you can certainly see where that's manifest it's done as entertainment
[13:12.360 --> 13:16.280]  it's done with kind of a shocking
[13:16.640 --> 13:23.760]  dramatized way but this is dramatic sensational material it is for you know
[13:23.760 --> 13:31.360]  designed for the general public and I find it very entertaining I mean I don't
[13:31.360 --> 13:35.560]  usually watch entertainment shows and I never watch reality TV what I've seen
[13:35.560 --> 13:41.160]  of it I hate this is the best reality TV I've ever seen but it is popcorn
[13:41.160 --> 13:45.560]  popcorn for the brain but it does actually have some vitamins in it it's
[13:45.560 --> 13:52.000]  not devoid of information it's fact it's chopped full of it I was really tired
[13:52.000 --> 13:59.800]  last night and I didn't feel like watching myself on television I've been
[13:59.800 --> 14:03.560]  invited out to California to see you know some of the finished product of the
[14:03.560 --> 14:08.080]  TV shows I didn't even do that I consulted on it heavily one of the main
[14:08.080 --> 14:13.520]  consultants on the show and but then I watched some clips of it when I was out
[14:13.520 --> 14:21.200]  there doing shoots or brainstorms or recommending people for them but I didn't
[14:21.200 --> 14:30.640]  want to watch it last night so I didn't I read a book instead hadn't read it in
[14:30.640 --> 14:37.360]  probably 15 years so I read it sort of reading a tale of two cities by Charles
[14:37.360 --> 14:43.080]  Dickens was the best of times was the worst of times so it opens and so I
[14:43.080 --> 14:48.000]  stayed up till about 11 reading that book so I got up this morning and I did
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.640]  watch the TV show and I almost don't know what to say the global warming
[14:53.640 --> 14:59.040]  episode is as near to perfect as it can get and that's the one I'm really proud
[14:59.040 --> 15:08.640]  of I heavily consulted on that I also massively consulted recommended basically
[15:08.640 --> 15:17.920]  everybody you see interviewed Monteef Estalon all of them this is the top show
[15:17.920 --> 15:21.200]  right now on true TV by the way and they reared all throughout the week I was
[15:21.200 --> 15:26.760]  looking at the numbers upwards of 10 million people watch this a week 1.7
[15:26.760 --> 15:30.080]  million when it first premieres then over and over again and they're going to
[15:30.080 --> 15:36.360]  keep rearing the series so conservatively hundreds of millions will end up
[15:36.360 --> 15:47.600]  seeing this in the aggregate and the sum total and the TV show hasn't shaken me
[15:47.600 --> 15:54.640]  up it's more it hasn't scrambled my brain that's not the word I'm having to
[15:54.640 --> 16:00.880]  assess this and I'm so busy with other issues I just kind of have to give the
[16:00.880 --> 16:07.280]  problem to my brain and then let it marinate and percolate and a punch card
[16:07.280 --> 16:13.360]  will pop out might be 3 a.m. next week might be an hour from now I mean I know
[16:13.360 --> 16:18.320]  all the different some parts of how this got on air why it got on air some of
[16:18.320 --> 16:22.960]  what went on behind the scenes with Time Warner what this signifies them
[16:22.960 --> 16:30.400]  allowing this on air even though I featured myself personally more
[16:30.400 --> 16:34.440]  prominently in this episode than any other episode this was my least favorite
[16:34.440 --> 16:42.080]  last night but it put out the most powerful info ever released on mainstream
[16:42.080 --> 16:46.160]  television ever there there's no debating that the cat was let out of the bag
[16:46.160 --> 16:55.560]  last night with this production but then as someone who's produced films and
[16:55.560 --> 17:04.760]  consulted on television shows I consulted on a scanner darkly and I
[17:04.760 --> 17:08.480]  consulted on several other films and television shows some of which I've
[17:08.480 --> 17:14.480]  signed on disclosures on but the point is that's I can't talk about it the point
[17:14.480 --> 17:21.600]  is the others were so incredibly powerful and pure that when I say this is my
[17:21.600 --> 17:24.360]  least favorite it doesn't mean I don't think it was good I think it was great
[17:24.360 --> 17:30.160]  and groundbreaking I have to say the labo part Dr. Arima labor I really like
[17:30.160 --> 17:40.760]  that is the one part because when they interviewed her three months ago she
[17:40.760 --> 17:44.680]  really thought we heard her live on air here that no we're gonna have martial
[17:44.680 --> 17:49.680]  law and we're gonna have these forced inoculations and I and I said well Dr.
[17:49.680 --> 17:53.320]  Labo from when I've seen the past sure you've got the documents where they
[17:53.320 --> 17:58.680]  told that we released that we got bureau of prisons getting ready for mass of
[17:58.680 --> 18:04.400]  death bureau of cemeteries getting ready for mass death New York State emergency
[18:04.400 --> 18:08.720]  managers in Indiana and Illinois on record saying they were being told get
[18:08.720 --> 18:13.040]  ready for millions dead this was in January and February so they were
[18:13.040 --> 18:17.960]  getting ready but I said this could just be a drill to scare local police and
[18:17.960 --> 18:21.440]  constabulary and they're going under federal control and then into scaring
[18:21.440 --> 18:25.280]  the public later into taking the shot which will then have a soft kill we know
[18:25.280 --> 18:28.480]  all the major vaccines do but reading the insert for this vaccine admitted can
[18:28.480 --> 18:33.120]  cause Guillain beret sterilize you reduce fertility give you cancer I mean it's
[18:33.120 --> 18:37.640]  admitted in the insert but I said the way the soft kills work is this this takes
[18:37.640 --> 18:41.200]  years to develop in most cases sure thousands of people have had convulsions
[18:41.200 --> 18:47.000]  or gotten Guillain beret and there's been some deaths and I've learned though
[18:47.000 --> 18:51.120]  that they test something and then if people don't buy it they then back off
[18:51.120 --> 18:54.840]  it's part of a conditioning process and sure they're running hard kills in
[18:54.840 --> 19:00.240]  Africa Asia Latin America where the polio vaccine this year has been killing
[19:00.240 --> 19:05.200]  people it's it's weaponized and it just it gives you full-blown super hardcore
[19:05.200 --> 19:12.800]  weaponized version of polio killed a bunch of people so I don't blame her for
[19:12.800 --> 19:16.040]  thinking they were about to launch it announcing North com military drills
[19:16.040 --> 19:20.600]  everywhere they're certainly considering and and I would look for some point in
[19:20.600 --> 19:25.120]  the future for them to really turn the heat up and they may launch some big
[19:25.120 --> 19:29.760]  blitzkrieg crises but instead I see the incremental March because if you add all
[19:29.760 --> 19:34.400]  the incrementalism together they can bring you into it slower and ensure you

[26:31.160 --> 26:35.600]  system and go along with these greedy murderous new order trash thank God I
[26:35.600 --> 26:43.160]  learned the power of the dynamic human spirit created in the image of God the
[26:43.160 --> 26:47.640]  new world order knows that that's why they play God a devilish God who wants
[26:47.640 --> 26:53.240]  to take free will from man everything the new order does is about taking free

[27:26.160 --> 27:33.200]  mysteries in the human heart and soul and mind and psyche and that much of the

[27:36.760 --> 27:44.320]  and small and fearful all I want you to do is to wake up and to look around you
[27:44.320 --> 27:51.920]  and to begin to investigate and to begin to question for yourself who could be
[27:51.920 --> 27:57.880]  against that who could disagree with that who could disagree with standing for
[27:57.880 --> 28:01.680]  the Declaration of Independence the Constitution the Bill of Rights versus
[28:01.680 --> 28:07.720]  the global governance offer of total tyranny and neo feudalistic serfdom

[32:57.160 --> 33:02.800]  discounts and Obama and Hillary Clinton did attend the Bilderberg meeting in
[33:02.800 --> 33:10.120]  Virginia in 2008 Daniel if the Bilderbergs are successful and they
[33:10.120 --> 33:16.600]  create this one-world government type scenario how does that affect John Q
[33:16.600 --> 33:20.640]  public the everyday citizen when you have all these regions merging into one
[33:20.640 --> 33:23.960]  you can have a world constitution which can take presidents of American
[33:23.960 --> 33:29.120]  Constitution so Daniel the Bilderbergs are out to destroy the sovereignty of
[33:29.120 --> 33:33.280]  the United States of America we're like the last bastion left it's the last beacon
[33:33.280 --> 33:39.480]  of hope we have taking our freedoms I thought that was bad enough but Estaline
[33:39.480 --> 33:44.200]  said it doesn't end there we Americans aren't only too independent the
[33:44.200 --> 33:48.880]  Bilderbergs think there's too many of us to control so they want to start
[33:48.880 --> 33:55.400]  eliminating people people like you and me needless to say the people who control
[33:55.400 --> 33:58.760]  the world they don't need seven billion people they just need enough people to
[33:58.760 --> 34:03.680]  work the fields as they did 700 years ago so in a society like the American
[34:03.680 --> 34:08.080]  Society if you actually have growth if you actually have progress you're
[34:08.080 --> 34:11.400]  creating something for future generations which is what the Bilderbergs
[34:11.400 --> 34:16.760]  are trying to destroy exactly Estaline gives Jesse Ventura more than enough to
[34:16.760 --> 34:22.600]  investigate but he also leaves him with a warning back in 1996 they try to kill
[34:22.600 --> 34:26.800]  me when we explode their plans wait for Canada wait they tried to kill you
[34:26.800 --> 34:31.400]  someone attempted to murder you absolutely obviously have to be very very
[34:31.400 --> 34:34.320]  careful what I do and how I do things and there's always concern for the
[34:34.320 --> 34:40.320]  family by the time the governor returns to home base his conspiracy team has
[34:40.320 --> 34:44.880]  already begun checking the facts okay people what do we got well there's one
[34:44.880 --> 34:48.840]  thing for sure this Bilderberg group definitely exists and it's totally on
[34:48.840 --> 34:52.840]  the open the meetings aren't any secret no but what goes on in the meetings is
[34:52.840 --> 34:57.800]  secret and some big names attend we have some surveillance photos from some past
[34:57.800 --> 35:03.880]  Bilderberg meetings guys like David Rockefeller Tim Geithner Geithner isn't
[35:03.880 --> 35:09.560]  either current Treasury Secretary Henry Kissinger and Henry Travis Queen
[35:09.560 --> 35:15.280]  Beatrix of the Netherlands Vernon Jordan isn't he Clinton's lawyer yeah and
[35:15.280 --> 35:19.400]  a Paul Wilpelitz and that's really just a tip of the iceberg there's a bunch of
[35:19.400 --> 35:23.000]  other big names that have been to meetings like this Tom Daschle Hank
[35:23.000 --> 35:28.400]  Paulson Condoleezza Rice Prince Charles my question is how do you get this many
[35:28.400 --> 35:32.080]  powerful people in the same room at the same time without there being some sort
[35:32.080 --> 35:35.160]  of hierarchy some sort of leadership that's running these meetings you're
[35:35.160 --> 35:38.520]  right you're hitting the nail on the head and they're all from different walks
[35:38.520 --> 35:46.520]  of life media politics business banking probably oil who knows where they're
[35:46.520 --> 35:51.080]  all from and they're all leaders of their own for lack of better term kingdoms
[35:51.080 --> 35:55.160]  yeah and now they're all getting together and they keep coming back I
[35:55.160 --> 36:01.520]  think it's obvious we got to go out and learn what we can about the Bilderbergs
[36:01.520 --> 36:16.440]  coming up okay ladies and gentlemen Webster Tarpley with a year in review
[36:16.440 --> 36:20.960]  decade and review looking forward to the next year we'll be joining us coming up

[36:43.120 --> 36:48.720]  Bilderberg their plan to set up world government to depopulate how the
[36:48.720 --> 36:53.760]  interlocking structure works unprecedented incredible courage by the
[36:53.760 --> 36:57.640]  producers by Jesse Ventura the producer and owner of the show I'm very
[36:57.640 --> 37:06.920]  honored to be a consultant on this just a incredible breakthrough watershed
[37:06.920 --> 37:15.400]  event for this to get on air it's unprecedented all the shows are so good
[37:15.400 --> 37:19.240]  I had to pick a favorite though I have to say the global warming fraud one it's
[37:19.240 --> 37:28.360]  just so focused so well documented so conclusive the big brother one will
[37:28.360 --> 37:36.320]  wake up masses of people this was a great episode I just think this episode
[37:36.320 --> 37:42.040]  is gonna be so shocking for people so on our side so totally one-sided to our
[37:42.040 --> 37:47.360]  view that I actually think people will watch it and won't believe it at least
[37:47.360 --> 37:51.480]  some people but it doesn't matter down the road they'll begin to see the
[37:51.480 --> 37:54.880]  evidence of it in their own lives see once you know the world population
[37:54.880 --> 37:58.120]  reduction program then you start seeing the evidence of it all around you and
[37:58.120 --> 38:02.520]  suddenly you see magazines on the rack calling for forcibly reducing population
[38:02.520 --> 38:06.720]  you see articles calling for one-child policies you see articles about drugs in
[38:06.720 --> 38:11.920]  the water about fertility dropping so overall I don't know how they got this
[38:11.920 --> 38:18.920]  on air I'm just stunned we're also gonna open the phones up in this hour and the
[38:18.920 --> 38:23.200]  next hour and just go over masses of new news that came out today and tons of

[38:57.720 --> 39:09.320]  day of 2009 a super blue moon that's incredibly rare one eight hundred two
[39:09.320 --> 39:15.120]  five nine ninety two thirty one one eight hundred two five nine ninety two
[39:15.120 --> 39:27.120]  thirty one and we will get you up and on the air I mean here's just some of the
[39:27.120 --> 39:31.120]  news I have in my stack in front of me today
[39:31.720 --> 39:37.520]  World Health Organization chief yet to be vaccinated against swine flu and it
[39:37.520 --> 39:41.040]  turned out the entire German government and other European governments will not
[39:41.040 --> 39:46.520]  take it and are given a additive free shot and that's probably just salt
[39:46.520 --> 39:50.520]  solution they do on television they said oh this is something special we're
[39:50.520 --> 39:58.720]  getting second full moon in a month term blue moon generally refers to the
[39:58.720 --> 40:05.920]  second full moon in a month and occurs just once every 2.7 years the last and
[40:05.920 --> 40:11.320]  it goes on here I'm talking about world leaders not taking shots and they throw
[40:11.320 --> 40:16.320]  up on screen the definition of blue moon I start reading it it's alright hey I
[40:16.320 --> 40:22.620]  love factoids too in a way it's almost like a teleprompter though because I have
[40:22.620 --> 40:25.220]  these big TV screens in here and while you guys are surfing the internet
[40:25.220 --> 40:29.520]  looking for documents and things I'll be looking at it and start reading what's
[40:29.520 --> 40:34.920]  on it World Health Organization chief yet to be vaccinated against swine flu
[40:34.920 --> 40:39.420]  you got all these other world leaders refusing to take it but you need to take
[40:39.420 --> 40:49.020]  it World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan revealed Tuesday that she
[40:49.020 --> 40:53.020]  had yet to be vaccinated against the swine flu virus which has killed over
[40:53.020 --> 41:03.820]  11,500 worldwide and a regular flu by the way kills around 300,000 a year or
[41:03.820 --> 41:07.420]  more than halfway through the flu season so the regular flu kills 300 plus
[41:07.420 --> 41:14.820]  thousand let's say we're halfway through so it'll be 22 23,000 let's say it
[41:14.820 --> 41:27.820]  kills another 11,500 so that's 23,000 what's 23,000 divided into 300,000 let's
[41:27.820 --> 41:33.720]  be conservative kills more than 300,000 a year could let's just say 23,000
[41:33.720 --> 41:43.220]  divided into 300,000 so then the the the the the regular seasonal flu kills
[41:43.220 --> 41:48.520]  13 times that's a good factoid blurb you gotta send that over to Watson or
[41:48.520 --> 41:57.220]  curtain him on a blurb so people get an idea the regular flu kills 13 times
[41:57.220 --> 42:07.820]  what this flu causes but we're told it's the deadliest pandemic since 1918 and
[42:07.820 --> 42:12.420]  you've all got to take the shot kind of like a 1976 the swine flew at military
[42:12.420 --> 42:16.720]  bases killed a few people that had just been inoculated and so they fear
[42:16.720 --> 42:19.320]  mongered and thousands got sick and hundreds and hundreds and that's
[42:19.320 --> 42:24.020]  conservative died more like tens of thousands died hundreds of thousands
[42:24.020 --> 42:31.020]  got sick let's just go with the official whitewash numbers the 1918 broke out
[42:31.020 --> 42:36.020]  after inoculations remember how they gave the live swine flew three months
[42:36.020 --> 42:43.520]  ago the first shots they put out which they admit incubated in the nostrils in
[42:43.520 --> 42:51.120]  the sinus and then it spreads and then yeah you did see more flu after that
[42:51.120 --> 42:56.820]  and it didn't mutate and then there have been people dying from the shots having
[42:56.820 --> 43:00.820]  convulsions becoming sterilized getting Guillain beret I know several people in
[43:00.820 --> 43:06.420]  Austin who took last year seasonal and got Guillain beret diagnosed by the
[43:06.420 --> 43:11.720]  doctor oh this is quite rare but quite normal no big deal yes you're you now
[43:11.720 --> 43:14.920]  have numb feet and numb hands you're lucky you didn't get it worse you're
[43:14.920 --> 43:18.920]  lucky you can even walk haha I still recommend you take the shot though
[43:18.920 --> 43:22.820]  because the unjustifies the means and statistically you know it helps so many
[43:22.820 --> 43:27.820]  people in such a small number get it should I just read headlines but how
[43:27.820 --> 43:32.420]  do you do that World Health Organization chief yet to be vaccinated against
[43:32.420 --> 43:39.520]  swine flu World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan revealed that she
[43:39.520 --> 43:45.820]  is yet to be vaccinated against the swine flu this from French news agency
[43:45.820 --> 43:53.220]  this is from press TV US Yemen gear up for fight for flight 253 retaliatory

[43:57.820 --> 44:02.140]  of them they started hyping last week before the Christmas Day underwear
[44:02.140 --> 44:08.660]  bombing and so now they're going after the retaliatory strike all because of
[44:08.660 --> 44:17.540]  the underwear bombing Washington and the capital of Yemen are reviewing
[44:17.540 --> 44:21.100]  targets for possible territory strike on Yemen soil that'll get its approval
[44:21.100 --> 44:24.660]  rating up power of pride guys people that stick those bumper stickers on their
[44:24.660 --> 44:28.500]  cars they'll suddenly be going I like Obama I don't care if you robbed us
[44:28.500 --> 44:31.820]  with the banks or government health care kind of like he's kind of getting
[44:31.820 --> 44:39.700]  tough I want to be body-scan proof I'm conservative and I like SWAT team here boy
[44:39.700 --> 44:46.140]  Washington and Yemen are reviewing targets for possible territory strike on
[44:46.140 --> 44:50.240]  Yemen soil in the wake of the failed Christmas Day attack on the Detroit
[44:50.240 --> 44:55.060]  bound airliner which al Qaeda and Yemen claims have organized yes a government
[44:55.060 --> 45:02.180]  run message board said so and the media is trained to pick this up number four
[45:02.180 --> 45:08.500]  years ago somebody did a fake beheading in their San Francisco garage I watched
[45:08.500 --> 45:11.940]  the video and said that's got to be fake that looks fake and then it came out a
[45:11.940 --> 45:17.220]  few days later oh that was fake then the guy that did it sent me an email saying
[45:17.220 --> 45:22.140]  yeah I'm a listener Alex I just did it as a joke show how stupid this is but I
[45:22.140 --> 45:26.860]  better not come on because the FBI is threatening me by the way dig that guy's
[45:26.860 --> 45:32.820]  name out I forget maybe he'll come on now in hindsight you guys read me in there
[45:32.820 --> 45:38.740]  guys read me in there right a note to ask me during the break I I want to get
[45:38.740 --> 45:43.340]  the guy on who did the fake beheading four or five years ago in San Francisco he
[45:43.340 --> 45:46.660]  said he'd come on later but the FBI was on his tail then he did it just to prove
[45:46.660 --> 45:49.180]  how they pick up fake media he'll probably come on now that'd be an
[45:49.180 --> 45:51.500]  interesting interview to do in hindsight he wouldn't come on then I bet they'll
[45:51.500 --> 45:57.860]  come on now I forget his name just Google fake beheading video San Francisco and
[45:57.860 --> 46:03.740]  you'll get it US Yemen gear up for flight 253 retaliatory strike and they
[46:03.740 --> 46:07.340]  just say oh you know the media just picks it up as if it's true oh Al Qaeda
[46:07.340 --> 46:11.340]  did it because the message board said so huh the grandson of the ADL head former
[46:11.340 --> 46:15.340]  ADL head Adam Gadan says so oh it must be true oh yeah they uploaded the video on
[46:15.340 --> 46:19.780]  the same video layer as the Al Qaeda logo the Intel Center is the same logo
[46:19.780 --> 46:24.220]  same video layer oh you mean they they they they uploaded the video yeah but

[46:38.020 --> 46:42.700]  case President Barack Obama orders a retaliatory strike yeah I'm feeling
[46:42.700 --> 46:47.300]  pretty good the banks rob me but at least we bombs some of your abs help
[46:47.300 --> 46:50.060]  bombs men and some people but they can't actually bomb the real Al Qaeda
[46:50.060 --> 46:55.180]  operatives but it'll make American men feel tough and strut around and bow
[46:55.180 --> 46:59.140]  down to some police and things and feel powerful to senior US official speaking
[46:59.140 --> 47:02.820]  and condition of anonymity told CNN on Tuesday that the effort is aimed at
[47:02.820 --> 47:06.940]  devising options for the White House to target Al Qaeda the official added the
[47:06.940 --> 47:10.100]  effort is to see whether targets can be specifically linked to the airliner
[47:10.100 --> 47:16.500]  incident and it's planning oh yes and of course the underwear bomber all his
[47:16.500 --> 47:19.500]  intelligence connections it was ushered on to the plane and protected and
[47:19.500 --> 47:26.500]  everything else so he he's now saying he he he did it with Al Qaeda and and he

[47:47.500 --> 47:51.300]  headline should be caught in line this prison-planet headline FBI caught lying

[47:55.820 --> 47:59.700]  bombers accomplice being protected multiple eyewitness accounts contradicted
[47:59.700 --> 48:04.820]  see first they said oh we didn't detain a second guy in the Detroit customs we

[48:07.780 --> 48:12.340]  first they said that person doesn't exist that doesn't happen that's a line now
[48:12.340 --> 48:18.500]  they say oh yeah it was unrelated it was a passport issue oh really but we have
[48:18.500 --> 48:22.580]  eyewitnesses that said the dog alerted to the bag he was taken behind closed
[48:22.580 --> 48:28.580]  doors he were told there was a bomb there's no John Doe number two Muhammad

[48:35.500 --> 48:39.420]  a gag order on the head of the of the base
[48:39.420 --> 48:43.900]  authorities have attempted to downplay the significance of the men seen involved
[48:43.900 --> 48:50.140]  in the plot including a Indian man that helped bomber Umar Farooq I'm my
[48:50.140 --> 48:56.940]  Bula Hula being sarcastic there bored the plane another man but is filming the
[48:56.940 --> 49:00.540]  entire flight included the bombing attempt as well as an Indian man handcuffed

[49:40.100 --> 49:47.020]  the war you're with al-qaeda that's how that psychology works that's why they've
[49:47.020 --> 49:52.180]  had all these Justice Department lawyers and John you and many others say if you
[49:52.180 --> 49:55.860]  criticize the war you're aiding al-qaeda thus you should be arrested and put in

[59:52.620 --> 1:00:00.900]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:12.340]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:12.340 --> 1:00:19.860]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.860 --> 1:00:23.300]  Alex Jones
[1:00:23.300 --> 1:00:51.700]  now into our number two of my final radio transmission of 2009 I'm tempted
[1:00:51.700 --> 1:00:56.540]  to drag my staff back in here tonight so I can do a live broadcast into the new
[1:00:56.540 --> 1:01:01.220]  year but don't worry don't look horrified I'm not gonna do that and guys can go
[1:01:01.220 --> 1:01:10.540]  out and partake of the grape by the way in Texas legislature passed a law the
[1:01:10.540 --> 1:01:16.260]  police would take blood without warrants the last five years under federal
[1:01:16.260 --> 1:01:20.980]  grants and they get sued would lose so the state legislature just said hey no
[1:01:20.980 --> 1:01:28.300]  more warrants take your blood without warrants and it's a no-refusal weekend
[1:01:28.300 --> 1:01:34.660]  let me tell the police something I don't drink very often to begin with I'll go
[1:01:34.660 --> 1:01:37.900]  six eight months without drinking then drink a few beers here and there and
[1:01:37.900 --> 1:01:44.740]  then say I'm not drinking anymore but I don't drink and drive you pull me over
[1:01:44.740 --> 1:01:49.260]  and want me to blow and violate my fifth amendment when I've done nothing
[1:01:49.260 --> 1:01:53.780]  wrong into your breathalyzer I'm not doing it and you stick your needle in my
[1:01:53.780 --> 1:01:58.980]  arm I don't care if you lie and somebody told you cops you're above the law and
[1:01:58.980 --> 1:02:03.980]  that you're immune from prosecution and immune from civil actions you're not when
[1:02:03.980 --> 1:02:09.460]  you're outside the Constitution you're not immune I mean if cops were immune
[1:02:09.460 --> 1:02:13.700]  they could rape your wife barbecue your kids I mean they are in third-world
[1:02:13.700 --> 1:02:17.980]  countries when cops are immune you live in North Korea you live in Mexico
[1:02:17.980 --> 1:02:22.180]  society collapses the government's telling you're telling you they're immune
[1:02:22.180 --> 1:02:26.140]  above the law you're at the Declaration of Independence but anybody sticks a
[1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:32.820]  needle in my arm you may beat the rap you're not gonna beat the ride and chief
[1:02:32.820 --> 1:02:39.660]  Art Acevedo the tyranny of good intentions he really thinks it's good to
[1:02:39.660 --> 1:02:44.700]  be a federal minion he sat in the studio repeatedly he really thinks because drunk
[1:02:44.700 --> 1:02:50.020]  drivers kill people he can violate the fourth amendment and the fifth amendment
[1:02:51.740 --> 1:02:55.860]  the feds aren't good guys aren't they want a bunch of they want to test
[1:02:55.860 --> 1:02:59.500]  police chiefs and see if you'll be a federal minion and they do these federal
[1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:03.180]  programs with federal smoking bans they get the states and cities to pass and
[1:03:03.180 --> 1:03:08.100]  federal seatbelt rules and that sound reasonable and then federal rules on
[1:03:08.100 --> 1:03:12.780]  toilets and light bulbs and federal rules on checkpoints and federal rules on
[1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:19.820]  blood draws until you're totally federal creatures and the federal rules
[1:03:19.820 --> 1:03:26.580]  themselves were written internationally and all over the country your cities
[1:03:26.580 --> 1:03:31.820]  that have been federalized have police out at RVs because they couldn't get
[1:03:31.820 --> 1:03:35.980]  doctors and nurses to do it they know sticking needles in people without
[1:03:35.980 --> 1:03:41.180]  warrants is a violation of the Constitution they couldn't get doctors
[1:03:41.180 --> 1:03:47.420]  to do it nurses in Austin so they have you the cops and I don't think cops are
[1:03:47.420 --> 1:03:50.140]  as dumb as they think you are but every time I mention this people don't believe
[1:03:50.140 --> 1:03:54.620]  it but if you Google it you can find it all over the country another federal
[1:03:54.620 --> 1:04:00.540]  edict police departments will not hire officers for at least the last 15 years
[1:04:00.540 --> 1:04:06.060]  with over a hundred IQ so you better act stupid if you want to be a police
[1:04:06.060 --> 1:04:11.340]  officer and you you've got above edge above average IQ and I heard the UN a
[1:04:11.340 --> 1:04:15.660]  month ago they announced they're gonna lower the global IQ score to 95 being
[1:04:15.660 --> 1:04:20.180]  average see people are so brain damaged that's not education that's that's
[1:04:20.180 --> 1:04:26.740]  that's basic intelligence people are becoming retarded folks they're
[1:04:26.740 --> 1:04:30.580]  poisoning everyone pretty soon somebody with an 80 IQ will be genius
[1:04:30.580 --> 1:04:35.140]  someone who knows how to talk will be known as a god creature knowing how to
[1:04:35.140 --> 1:04:43.300]  tie your shoelaces will be an active pull-it-surprise winning acumen I'm not
[1:04:43.300 --> 1:04:48.980]  joking it will be known as a conspiracy theory in two or three generations
[1:04:48.980 --> 1:04:53.140]  that women ever gave milk to their babies from their mammary glands that's
[1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:59.260]  how the families once lived together everyone will live in dormitories with
[1:04:59.260 --> 1:05:03.380]  shaved heads this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:05:03.380 --> 1:05:07.660]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:05:07.660 --> 1:05:11.780]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[1:05:11.780 --> 1:05:15.700]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[1:05:15.700 --> 1:05:19.340]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:19.340 --> 1:05:23.900]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:23.900 --> 1:05:27.940]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:27.940 --> 1:05:31.740]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:31.740 --> 1:05:35.340]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:35.340 --> 1:05:39.700]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:05:39.700 --> 1:05:42.860]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:05:42.860 --> 1:05:46.540]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[1:05:46.540 --> 1:05:52.060]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:52.060 --> 1:05:56.860]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call
[1:05:56.860 --> 1:06:04.700]  1-877-327-0365 hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the
[1:06:04.700 --> 1:06:09.100]  silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[1:06:09.100 --> 1:06:13.100]  and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the
[1:06:13.100 --> 1:06:16.900]  solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[1:06:16.900 --> 1:06:20.860]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[1:06:20.860 --> 1:06:25.620]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[1:06:25.620 --> 1:06:30.500]  and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[1:06:30.500 --> 1:06:35.460]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products you can
[1:06:35.460 --> 1:06:40.140]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[1:06:40.140 --> 1:06:44.260]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making
[1:06:44.260 --> 1:06:50.580]  production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more
[1:06:50.580 --> 1:06:55.060]  about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[1:06:55.060 --> 1:07:05.620]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:07:05.620 --> 1:07:11.140]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:13.780]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[1:07:13.780 --> 1:07:18.820]  have tremendous influence on our president in congress and they really are
[1:07:18.820 --> 1:07:23.420]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[1:07:23.420 --> 1:07:27.780]  citizens to pay attention fall of the republic identifies the enemies of our
[1:07:27.780 --> 1:07:33.060]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[1:07:33.060 --> 1:07:37.340]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[1:07:37.340 --> 1:07:40.860]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[1:07:40.860 --> 1:07:46.100]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[1:07:46.100 --> 1:07:51.740]  have seen a fall of the republic yet your copy of fall of the republic on DVD
[1:07:51.740 --> 1:07:57.060]  at info wars dot com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[1:07:57.060 --> 1:08:05.660]  prison planet dot TV from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy
[1:08:05.660 --> 1:08:22.220]  lines the information war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[1:08:22.220 --> 1:08:27.620]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time we're here
[1:08:27.620 --> 1:08:36.300]  live back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. this is the final radio transmission of 2009 the
[1:08:36.300 --> 1:08:41.820]  final Alex Jones show radio transmission okay coming up Webster Griffin
[1:08:41.820 --> 1:08:49.500]  Tarpley in the next hour I'm gonna do a year in review a decade in review the
[1:08:49.500 --> 1:08:53.300]  decade of tyranny looking forward into what is the decade of awakening coming
[1:08:53.300 --> 1:09:06.740]  and then I believe the decade of victory in through and beyond 2020 which will be
[1:09:06.740 --> 1:09:12.260]  here before we know it but right now let's go to the phone calls now I'm
[1:09:12.260 --> 1:09:15.660]  gonna give each caller and I always say this can never do it but I am doing it
[1:09:15.660 --> 1:09:26.340]  one minute 1-800-259-9231 mark in Oregon go ahead morning Alex hey buddy hey
[1:09:26.340 --> 1:09:31.140]  Alex you know I I just want to wish you and yours and all of us the best new
[1:09:31.140 --> 1:09:35.100]  years yet and really defeating evil and that'll make it the best new years yet
[1:09:35.100 --> 1:09:39.740]  more than we ever have and I want to just give you a quick wish that I have and
[1:09:39.740 --> 1:09:45.860]  it's kind of a combination of wish suggestion and request but you may have
[1:09:45.860 --> 1:09:52.340]  already had this concept but I believe the concepts new concepts and ways of
[1:09:52.340 --> 1:09:57.980]  addressing the strategy of evil is really just so important at this time
[1:09:57.980 --> 1:10:03.220]  and that is that perhaps you could consider convening a Liberty conference
[1:10:03.220 --> 1:10:08.740]  which could actually be top secret and that you could get together with experts
[1:10:08.740 --> 1:10:14.500]  who many of whom are guests on your show and other people that you know that
[1:10:14.500 --> 1:10:20.540]  have great expertise in publicity acting and such as that and that you could
[1:10:20.540 --> 1:10:24.820]  come up together with some pervasive vehicles of global publicity which I
[1:10:24.820 --> 1:10:29.500]  think would toss a very large monkey wrench into this machinery of the New
[1:10:29.500 --> 1:10:34.340]  World Order implementation agenda machine which is very fine-tuned and if
[1:10:34.340 --> 1:10:39.180]  you throw a large enough monkey wrench into it their contingency plans for
[1:10:39.180 --> 1:10:42.620]  that type of monkey wrench will not be effective if you can okay mark I
[1:10:42.620 --> 1:10:47.380]  appreciate I appreciate your call I don't have the organizational skills for
[1:10:47.380 --> 1:10:52.780]  that you know I'm I was just signing checks for my employees here during the
[1:10:52.780 --> 1:10:57.140]  break I mean I and then people have had continental congresses and they've had
[1:10:57.140 --> 1:11:02.300]  meetings and some good comes out of that it's good to get the leaders in the
[1:11:02.300 --> 1:11:08.620]  Liberty movement together I don't think we're up to the 1776 point yet and I
[1:11:08.620 --> 1:11:17.860]  don't think we've seen the caliber of Thomas Jefferson George Washington Sam
[1:11:17.860 --> 1:11:29.740]  Adams rise but I think as things become more apparent we will see more and more
[1:11:29.740 --> 1:11:33.140]  people Washington didn't come on the scene till very late he wanted to go
[1:11:33.140 --> 1:11:36.220]  along with the system but once he decided it was tyranny he had to face it
[1:11:36.220 --> 1:11:42.540]  and so there's a big wake-up happening right now what I will do is attack any
[1:11:42.540 --> 1:11:46.940]  Benedict Arnold who attempts to take control of our awakening in our movement
[1:11:46.940 --> 1:11:52.380]  that's why I'm forced to go after Glenn Beck that guy is pure bad news a
[1:11:52.380 --> 1:11:59.500]  judo scope and if you don't know how he's a judo scope you haven't been paying
[1:11:59.500 --> 1:12:04.900]  attention come on for the banker bailout takeover says the FEMA camps
[1:12:04.900 --> 1:12:13.100]  don't exist it's always bad-mouthing Ron Paul then saying he likes Ron Paul you
[1:12:13.100 --> 1:12:20.500]  gotta watch that man let's go ahead and talk to Michael in California you're on
[1:12:20.500 --> 1:12:26.820]  the air hey Alex how you doing good sir as well as you can I under I imagine
[1:12:26.820 --> 1:12:33.420]  it or the situation that we face day in and day out I want to say something that
[1:12:33.420 --> 1:12:37.820]  goes without saying from many of your listeners but I want to say thank you to
[1:12:37.820 --> 1:12:42.580]  you and Aaron and all the work that you've done over the last 10 years to
[1:12:42.580 --> 1:12:46.340]  bring everything to the forefront I would like to take those red coats of
[1:12:46.340 --> 1:12:50.220]  bloody red coats up on Steve for what they've done thank goodness
[1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:54.060]  they haven't been headed at this point and I want to kind of reminisce things
[1:12:54.060 --> 1:12:59.500]  and tie it into Jesse's show last night you know it's it's a long way from
[1:12:59.500 --> 1:13:04.980]  Oklahoma City and as pertain you know as pertain was a big topic so many many
[1:13:04.980 --> 1:13:09.540]  years ago on your show and Jesse tied that in last night with Dr. Stan
[1:13:09.540 --> 1:13:15.060]  Monteith and the whole thing about the assassination of the world population
[1:13:15.060 --> 1:13:21.940]  through to the use of food is just it's just unimaginable yet it's true and I
[1:13:21.940 --> 1:13:29.820]  know I mean a national TV show that I heavily consulted on I I mean to see my
[1:13:29.820 --> 1:13:33.660]  input I mean they presented it in the way they wanted to and they added a lot
[1:13:33.660 --> 1:13:39.900]  of their own research but Monteith and Esteline and all these people I sent them
[1:13:39.900 --> 1:13:45.820]  to talk to and to have Dr. Monteith there on television talking about how they
[1:13:45.820 --> 1:13:50.580]  put the poison in the food and how it's part of the larger program and and and
[1:13:50.580 --> 1:13:54.580]  and and to have Ventura at the end of the show say yes there's a world
[1:13:54.580 --> 1:13:58.220]  government yes there's a Bilderberg group and yes they're secret and yes they
[1:13:58.220 --> 1:14:05.540]  want to reduce our population it's just it it it makes my brain burn with all
[1:14:05.540 --> 1:14:09.860]  the different how do this get on air well are the elite throwing it in our
[1:14:09.860 --> 1:14:14.220]  face what they're planning to do you know Jesse seems to think that's part of
[1:14:14.220 --> 1:14:18.460]  it yeah it's so mind-boggling because here we have the former governor of
[1:14:18.460 --> 1:14:24.420]  Minnesota you know addressing these issues and it's out in the forefront and
[1:14:24.420 --> 1:14:27.740]  I got one I got one last thank you I want to send out and that's the Ted
[1:14:27.740 --> 1:14:31.100]  Anderson because when you first started out you're doing two hours then you
[1:14:31.100 --> 1:14:35.740]  went to three hours GCN with subscription only now you hear Midas resource
[1:14:35.740 --> 1:14:40.180]  commercials all over terrestrial radio satellite radio he's doing a great job
[1:14:40.180 --> 1:14:46.860]  and thank God that you guys are in it in it to win it I can't I can't thank you
[1:14:46.860 --> 1:14:53.900]  enough I can't thank you enough Michael yeah in it to win it in it to win it
[1:14:53.900 --> 1:14:59.580]  taking the bull by the horns taking destiny by the horns taking the wheel
[1:14:59.580 --> 1:15:07.220]  of destiny on the ship yeah I happen to know Ted Anderson's finances and Ted
[1:15:07.220 --> 1:15:13.260]  Anderson makes a lot less money than I do Ted takes almost everything all his
[1:15:13.260 --> 1:15:20.860]  profits very frugal God drives an old car and puts it into advertising and he's
[1:15:20.860 --> 1:15:26.500]  running advertising like I couldn't afford running ads on Rush Limbaugh and
[1:15:26.500 --> 1:15:35.660]  other places for fall the Republic so Ted I sell him the Ted a tiny profit for
[1:15:35.660 --> 1:15:46.780]  myself and then he sells them on there literally to get the word out and it's
[1:15:46.780 --> 1:15:51.100]  it's it's barely breaking even first time he didn't make money the second time
[1:15:51.100 --> 1:15:56.260]  he ran ads it's actually breaking even making a little bit and Ted I mean gave
[1:15:56.260 --> 1:16:02.460]  was it $300,000 to Ron Paul or more you're like oh well he didn't win think
[1:16:02.460 --> 1:16:07.140]  now three years ago maybe one in ten knew the Federal Reserve was private now
[1:16:07.140 --> 1:16:12.580]  they've had national polls were over 80% know what's private two months ago it
[1:16:12.580 --> 1:16:17.380]  was 75% knew it was private wanted it audited I saw one 82% wanted audited like
[1:16:17.380 --> 1:16:26.140]  two weeks ago a couple months from now 90% will know it's private and wanted audited
[1:16:26.140 --> 1:16:33.660]  we've gone from maybe 10% knowing to 80% that's what Ron Paul was just a focus a
[1:16:33.660 --> 1:16:37.260]  focal point to go out and say the to teach people about the offshore banks
[1:16:37.260 --> 1:16:41.540]  the shadow government the private fellow reserve the New World Order the
[1:16:41.540 --> 1:16:45.700]  medicalized tyranny that Ron Paul talks about see our information has become so
[1:16:45.700 --> 1:16:50.340]  mainstream that if the mainstream TV doesn't cover some of it they become
[1:16:50.340 --> 1:17:02.780]  obsolete obsolescence I mean I see national polls in some cases of over
[1:17:02.780 --> 1:17:09.260]  90% usually it's 85 86 87 I see you've all seen them I don't tend to believe one
[1:17:09.260 --> 1:17:12.900]  poll I believe indexes of polls and then if I see that on the street as well
[1:17:12.900 --> 1:17:19.900]  it's mirrored by that and I you know you've got around 10% of people that
[1:17:19.900 --> 1:17:25.420]  believe a lone government killed Kennedy and no matter how many PR pieces and
[1:17:25.420 --> 1:17:29.380]  propaganda pieces and fake science pieces they put on TV the number goes up
[1:17:29.380 --> 1:17:36.180]  and up and up it's over 90% right now 90% conservative know the government
[1:17:36.180 --> 1:17:40.940]  killed Kennedy know we've had a shadow government I mean Bruce Willis was a
[1:17:40.940 --> 1:17:46.340]  big neocon he saw my films woke up and now says the Vanity Fair the same
[1:17:46.340 --> 1:17:49.340]  people that killed Kennedy are the ones running our government right now we have
[1:17:49.340 --> 1:17:54.220]  a shadow government things aren't what I thought all along see he was that 10%
[1:17:54.220 --> 1:17:59.100]  still hadn't woken up Bruce Willis is waking up just a blue collar pro
[1:17:59.100 --> 1:18:06.780]  military red white and blue hearty man blue collar they're like I love America
[1:18:06.780 --> 1:18:10.900]  and the military wants to run a checkpoint search me it must be good and
[1:18:10.900 --> 1:18:14.260]  now Bruce Willis is finding out where there's a really being American he's
[1:18:14.260 --> 1:18:22.660]  going wait a minute wait a minute I'm not gonna be a sucker anymore I don't
[1:18:22.660 --> 1:18:28.580]  like the Democrats but I don't like the Republicans either see once you wake up
[1:18:28.580 --> 1:18:35.100]  ladies and gentlemen once you wake up there's no going back once you unlock
[1:18:35.100 --> 1:18:38.460]  somebody's mind they're no longer a mind-controlled zombie they see for
[1:18:38.460 --> 1:18:42.020]  themselves you don't have to keep reapplying lies and propaganda see the
[1:18:42.020 --> 1:18:49.220]  enemy has to reapply their lies and so you've got upwards of 90% of people are
[1:18:49.220 --> 1:18:56.380]  now away but the last domino to fall and it's beginning to teeter and it's
[1:18:56.380 --> 1:19:01.420]  going to fall the question is how fast the faster the better every person you
[1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:04.580]  wake up every person you try to wake up they may not wake up that day they'll
[1:19:04.580 --> 1:19:10.820]  wake up a year from now when they see somebody at a bus stop calmly arguing
[1:19:10.820 --> 1:19:14.820]  with the cops so the cops taser them they'll go remember what my neighbor told
[1:19:14.820 --> 1:19:20.060]  me about that they'll keep driving but they'll remember and say I'm not safe
[1:19:20.060 --> 1:19:23.900]  if they can taser that innocent person for no reason I better get involved
[1:19:23.900 --> 1:19:28.060]  they'll start finding their courage their willingness to fight their
[1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:33.100]  willingness to say no their willingness to say I'm a human being get off my back
[1:19:33.100 --> 1:19:38.460]  you're not my god good police will find their strength to say no to unlawful
[1:19:38.460 --> 1:19:45.100]  orders we're finding our legs we're learning to stand up the last domino to
[1:19:45.100 --> 1:19:50.140]  fall is that the majority is awake we all just feel alone so we're all sitting
[1:19:50.140 --> 1:19:54.300]  on our butts but if we all just start speaking out we'll all find each other
[1:19:54.300 --> 1:19:59.700]  there's pockets of idiots out there when you run into morons move on find

[1:24:05.180 --> 1:24:14.020]  let's go to Rick Rick in Texas go ahead thanks for all you do listen I just
[1:24:14.020 --> 1:24:19.900]  want to get off two points I was watching Jesse show last night loved it
[1:24:19.900 --> 1:24:24.540]  but right immediately after us did you would notice what came on it was all
[1:24:24.540 --> 1:24:30.660]  what you were on your show about homeland security fighting terrorist oh yeah
[1:24:30.660 --> 1:24:36.260]  yeah so and so they're they're trying to fight back but it was so goofy that I
[1:24:36.260 --> 1:24:41.460]  just look ridiculous to me yeah it the only reason I saw that is I didn't watch
[1:24:41.460 --> 1:24:45.780]  it live last night is that the YouTube video I pulled up this morning and the
[1:24:45.780 --> 1:24:49.980]  DVD I burned both had like a minute or two of the next show and it went
[1:24:49.980 --> 1:24:54.740]  care is during the Middle East planning an attack but homeland security
[1:24:54.740 --> 1:24:59.180]  surveilling everyone to keep them safe they showed like a radar system spinning
[1:24:59.180 --> 1:25:03.580]  so yeah here's big brother we're gonna keep you safe set up a police state
[1:25:03.580 --> 1:25:07.140]  grid and then spike your water was sterilant that's what it should have
[1:25:07.140 --> 1:25:11.700]  said yes it was laughable just at the timing of it you know you know that they
[1:25:11.700 --> 1:25:15.420]  pulled it on there to try and try and wipe out a little bit of what we were
[1:25:15.420 --> 1:25:23.180]  doing but I also another suggestion one suggestion is the the attorney mr.
[1:25:23.180 --> 1:25:31.180]  Haskell he would be an excellent episode for Jesse to do well we have to see
[1:25:31.180 --> 1:25:35.540]  if they get picked up for a second full season seven parts is called a full
[1:25:35.540 --> 1:25:42.540]  season but it's but it's a small season 1214 parts for a bigger season and it's
[1:25:42.540 --> 1:25:48.860]  it's gotten the highest ratings for any true TV show in its first run and so if
[1:25:48.860 --> 1:25:55.500]  it doesn't get picked back up you know why he did his deal he promised to be
[1:25:55.500 --> 1:26:01.420]  fair he but he got final cut he got agreement that he would listen to the
[1:26:01.420 --> 1:26:06.420]  studio but that he would have final cut and so he went into this thinking he
[1:26:06.420 --> 1:26:11.540]  would expose something if it wasn't true and in every episode he basically comes
[1:26:11.540 --> 1:26:18.260]  away with yeah this is really going on I mean imagine a TV show and and you know
[1:26:18.260 --> 1:26:21.580]  I've plugged every other episode but this one I kind of forgot about this big
[1:26:21.580 --> 1:26:25.500]  episode coming up that I'm a huge part of the biggest part of any of the
[1:26:25.500 --> 1:26:30.220]  episodes and I didn't even plug the episode that I mainly feature in until
[1:26:30.220 --> 1:26:35.660]  yesterday we put a blur about on info wars.com but I'm gonna talk more about
[1:26:35.660 --> 1:26:41.020]  it in the last hour it's just to see open discussion of the globalist master
[1:26:41.020 --> 1:26:46.500]  plan on national television and and how they're poisoning the food the water the
[1:26:46.500 --> 1:26:54.220]  drugs it was incredible I mean it was absolutely amazing thank you Rick I
[1:26:54.220 --> 1:27:01.140]  appreciate your call John and Ohio you're on the air yes Alex I agree and
[1:27:01.140 --> 1:27:07.620]  cheered on everything you said up till now about the 9-11 truth about Glenn
[1:27:07.620 --> 1:27:12.180]  Beck this rat who was probably got more blood on his hands from every day on his
[1:27:12.180 --> 1:27:16.700]  radio program peddling the lies even beyond what Bush and Cheney did to
[1:27:16.700 --> 1:27:22.660]  drag us into Iraq guys a total phony the global warming hoax the vaccines
[1:27:22.660 --> 1:27:27.260]  everything but I would ask if you would have a professor Grover Furr furr with
[1:27:27.260 --> 1:27:33.460]  two Rs or Michael Perente Perente on your program because I think though you
[1:27:33.460 --> 1:27:39.580]  do a yeoman service and exposing things that are really teeing off the the
[1:27:39.580 --> 1:27:45.260]  globalist on the other hand I believe that you are promoting one of the most
[1:27:45.260 --> 1:27:50.980]  establishment CIA disinformation the most extreme version of it whenever you
[1:27:50.980 --> 1:27:55.540]  refer to anything having to do with communism or Marxism this kind of broad
[1:27:55.540 --> 1:27:59.700]  bushes but what has been used to kill millions of people around the world to
[1:27:59.700 --> 1:28:06.820]  call communist who usually exist in the small forum in various countries the
[1:28:06.820 --> 1:28:10.740]  justification for killing human rights workers are smearing them with that brush
[1:28:10.740 --> 1:28:19.700]  of priests nuns Union organizers and the rest of it because I think the one
[1:28:19.700 --> 1:28:24.060]  reason that you have some success partial success in the media is because
[1:28:24.060 --> 1:28:27.140]  they really hate what you're doing you're exposing about the things I've
[1:28:27.140 --> 1:28:31.740]  just mentioned but they love your extreme version of the CIA operation
[1:28:31.740 --> 1:28:38.060]  mockingbird anti-communist propaganda so I really believe that and I think you
[1:28:38.060 --> 1:28:43.100]  want John you've been calling for what five six years yeah so I know what you're
[1:28:43.100 --> 1:28:46.460]  about my support most of much of what you're talking about John I appreciate
[1:28:46.460 --> 1:28:50.180]  your call and you call it about once a month and it's like a replay of the same
[1:28:50.180 --> 1:28:58.700]  thing just because I don't like the New World Order Europe the United States
[1:28:58.700 --> 1:29:04.500]  England and Israel with what they're doing because big government always
[1:29:04.500 --> 1:29:09.260]  becomes corrupt and always becomes bad not because they're Jews not because
[1:29:09.260 --> 1:29:12.860]  they're British not because we're American but because we've got a big
[1:29:12.860 --> 1:29:18.420]  corrupt old government that's why empires always fall they become corrupt
[1:29:18.420 --> 1:29:25.460]  nations always fall I'm not against Mexicans I'm against the corruption of
[1:29:25.460 --> 1:29:31.940]  Mexico so just because I don't like the corruption of our government doesn't
[1:29:31.940 --> 1:29:37.460]  mean I like communist and you get so confused by this I'm against corruption
[1:29:37.460 --> 1:29:42.740]  I'm against collectivism I'm gonna explain this to you John on the other
[1:29:42.740 --> 1:29:49.820]  side and I'm gonna go to Chase Julio chief and others

[1:33:16.940 --> 1:33:20.940]  John calling in from Ohio
[1:33:20.940 --> 1:33:33.940]  said why you guys got audio feeding to me because I just caught some audio through
[1:33:33.940 --> 1:33:39.500]  my headphones that's weird oh you were telling me we've already gone to John
[1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:44.980]  no I know John's gone so there's so is John still on hold I mean how would we
[1:33:44.980 --> 1:33:48.620]  go to break leave then I mentioned the caller and then he's put back on with
[1:33:48.620 --> 1:33:51.620]  me
[1:33:54.340 --> 1:34:01.460]  okay again I just knew I had a caller talking in my ear here
[1:34:03.980 --> 1:34:10.900]  all right final radio broadcast of 2009
[1:34:10.900 --> 1:34:30.820]  and John from Ohio calls in and John is not stupid John is on a team John has
[1:34:30.820 --> 1:34:36.460]  invested most of his life in being a communist and he's admitted on air he's
[1:34:36.460 --> 1:34:44.780]  a communist but then when I say that I don't want communism why I'm spewing
[1:34:44.780 --> 1:34:50.860]  what the CIA puts out as its rhetoric John the Soviets have released their
[1:34:50.860 --> 1:35:03.500]  archives the Soviets have released their archives and it turns out McCarthy was
[1:35:03.500 --> 1:35:09.820]  right and when Joseph McCarthy found out there was a group above the communist
[1:35:09.820 --> 1:35:16.140]  big industrialist bankers on record and when he found out the army was funding
[1:35:16.140 --> 1:35:21.100]  communist and giving them weapons secrets which has now been declassified he
[1:35:21.100 --> 1:35:27.460]  wasn't useful anymore yes in the dialectic communism was meant to be a
[1:35:27.460 --> 1:35:32.580]  limited threat of the Russians and an excuse to put US forces all over the
[1:35:32.580 --> 1:35:37.740]  world to oppose the other arm of the banker that was the communist that's
[1:35:37.740 --> 1:35:41.580]  the beautiful dialectic the communists get to move out and invade countries in
[1:35:41.580 --> 1:35:46.580]  the name of countering the West and its imperialism and then the West gets to go
[1:35:46.580 --> 1:35:50.380]  out and start conquering countries in the name of stopping the domino effect of
[1:35:50.380 --> 1:35:57.100]  the evil empire of communism when both arms unknowingly at the mid and lower
[1:35:57.100 --> 1:36:02.020]  levels were compartmentalized part of the same system just like the
[1:36:02.020 --> 1:36:06.500]  republicans and the democrats or the conservatives and labor both the major
[1:36:06.500 --> 1:36:10.940]  political parties in every country are controlled and now I can have members of
[1:36:10.940 --> 1:36:15.140]  the european parliament on former governors on congressman on and they'll
[1:36:15.140 --> 1:36:21.900]  all explain that the globalist game is a false debate a false dichotomy a false
[1:36:21.900 --> 1:36:27.340]  system you go to a football game and it's the yellow jackets versus the bears
[1:36:27.340 --> 1:36:35.500]  or it's the cowboys versus the raiders you go to a high school football game or
[1:36:35.500 --> 1:36:45.420]  it's the mountain lions versus the blue devils whatever it is okay but there's a
[1:36:45.420 --> 1:36:49.540]  world outside that game outside the parking lot outside the cheerleaders
[1:36:49.540 --> 1:36:54.900]  outside the high school coaches outside the nachos and cotton candy and frito pie
[1:36:54.900 --> 1:36:59.660]  there's a bigger world I'm not in your little sports stadium John get it through
[1:36:59.660 --> 1:37:04.300]  your head you've been calling for five six years maybe longer and you don't get
[1:37:04.300 --> 1:37:09.260]  that and other leftist and admitted communists don't get it I am holding in
[1:37:09.260 --> 1:37:15.820]  my hand the Saul Alinsky's books we own them in this office in my hand I am
[1:37:15.820 --> 1:37:23.620]  holding Hillary Clinton's treatise written about the Alinsky method where
[1:37:23.620 --> 1:37:32.660]  she agrees with communism and covertly taking over local governments now you
[1:37:32.660 --> 1:37:37.540]  read her treatise from the late 1960s and it's word-for-word what joseph
[1:37:37.540 --> 1:37:41.100]  McCarthy said it's just from a communist perspective of how you're
[1:37:41.100 --> 1:37:46.900]  infiltrating and taking over except she's funded by the Ford Foundation the
[1:37:46.900 --> 1:37:50.700]  Annenberg Foundation the Rockefeller Foundation the Rockefeller Brothers
[1:37:50.700 --> 1:37:57.940]  Foundation the Carnegie Endowment I mean who do you think funded the 1917 coup in
[1:37:57.940 --> 1:38:06.900]  Russia our criminal stinking government along with British intelligence you
[1:38:06.900 --> 1:38:12.380]  don't think that the Empire sends in commandos and says hey we're another
[1:38:12.380 --> 1:38:17.900]  Empire here to overthrow you no workers of the world unite we are commies we're
[1:38:17.900 --> 1:38:21.300]  here to give you free stuff you don't like that landowner your family's been
[1:38:21.300 --> 1:38:26.340]  slaving for for ten generations we're gonna kill him tonight and I'm gonna
[1:38:26.340 --> 1:38:30.420]  make you my local lieutenant and you get to rob the other neighbors and send
[1:38:30.420 --> 1:38:34.500]  people to camps how does that sound and they find the one thug and they do it
[1:38:34.500 --> 1:38:38.660]  you want to rape that other farmers daughter she looks good yes but she is
[1:38:38.660 --> 1:38:44.740]  poor like us she is not part of the bourgeoisie or part of the elite it does
[1:38:44.740 --> 1:38:59.020]  not matter Drago rape her enjoy her have her for yourself that's all it is and
[1:38:59.020 --> 1:39:03.540]  when Stalin kicked out the US team Trotsky just came back to the US and his
[1:39:03.540 --> 1:39:12.340]  top protege William Crystal's daddy openly a top gummy was hired by the
[1:39:12.340 --> 1:39:18.140]  Pentagon and runs everything I mean that's how America works I mean I think
[1:39:18.140 --> 1:39:28.500]  this is I mean the neocon stage 911 your precious Trotsky was nothing but a
[1:39:28.500 --> 1:39:36.700]  banker operator a professional revolutionary who got double-crossed by
[1:39:36.700 --> 1:39:43.580]  Lenin and then Stalin and Stalin had somebody go down to Mexico City and put
[1:39:43.580 --> 1:39:48.020]  a hatchet in his head because he knew that the United States was funding
[1:39:48.020 --> 1:39:58.660]  Trotsky to go back in there with a group of revolutionaries and overthrow him no
[1:39:58.660 --> 1:40:04.980]  honor among thieves there is no such thing as communism there is no such
[1:40:04.980 --> 1:40:08.900]  thing as collectivism unless it's slavery you have a banker bailout to
[1:40:08.900 --> 1:40:12.380]  help people with their mortgages day one they bait and switch it and give it all
[1:40:12.380 --> 1:40:16.060]  the banks for giant bonuses in your face and say we won't say where it went
[1:40:16.060 --> 1:40:19.300]  you government health care all you stupid collectivists and liberals are
[1:40:19.300 --> 1:40:27.260]  for day one you finally get the bill you go what it's too late to stop it you
[1:40:27.260 --> 1:40:36.260]  mean I get less free health care but you get more money what there is no free
[1:40:36.260 --> 1:40:40.140]  lunch there is no free ride the only way you have a free system is to have a
[1:40:40.140 --> 1:40:45.100]  tiny government and an armed citizenry so when private robber barons try to come
[1:40:45.100 --> 1:40:48.900]  rob you like the Rockefellers did you can stand up for yourself it's
[1:40:48.900 --> 1:40:59.060]  independence that's what it's about the CIA is an anti-communist they're only
[1:40:59.060 --> 1:41:04.620]  anti-communist if it's a real communist organization that picked up their fake
[1:41:04.620 --> 1:41:09.420]  ideology their banker created synthetic ideology that are setting up their own
[1:41:09.420 --> 1:41:13.580]  thugdom that isn't working with the globalist if you're a communist you
[1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:17.940]  work with the globalist you're good but you're some central american or south
[1:41:17.940 --> 1:41:25.740]  american individual a thug or not and you don't play ball you get overthrown if
[1:41:25.740 --> 1:41:29.380]  you're a right winger and you don't play ball you're overthrown if you're a
[1:41:29.380 --> 1:41:34.180]  bleeding heart real liberal like Muhammad mozadek you and fight communist
[1:41:34.180 --> 1:41:42.540]  you get overthrown if you're serbians running your own free market system you
[1:41:42.540 --> 1:41:48.340]  get overthrown if you're a dictator like Muammar Gaddafi with his own oil you get
[1:41:48.340 --> 1:41:52.020]  overthrown unless you play ball now he's good we've never been at war with
[1:41:52.020 --> 1:41:56.620]  East Asia we've always been at war with East Asia remember 1984 Gaddafi's the
[1:41:56.620 --> 1:41:59.940]  ultimate able the absolute devil incarnate now he's a wonderful ally a
[1:41:59.940 --> 1:42:07.260]  gallon ally alright I want to go back to your calls it's just John I don't like
[1:42:07.260 --> 1:42:10.340]  wasting my time but it but we do have new listeners and it's important to
[1:42:10.340 --> 1:42:21.700]  explain to them communism is a fake world view Karl Marx Engels they were
[1:42:21.700 --> 1:42:28.220]  openly financed by big money out of England in Germany just like Lord
[1:42:28.220 --> 1:42:35.100]  Milner's group financed several different right-wing revolutions Adolf
[1:42:35.100 --> 1:42:40.820]  Hitler namely in British back German intelligence put him into power then
[1:42:40.820 --> 1:42:45.660]  told him to attack then set him up he had a peace treaty with the British they
[1:42:45.660 --> 1:42:49.820]  sent the deputy Fuhrer Rudolph Hess over to say we had a deal with you why are
[1:42:49.820 --> 1:42:54.460]  you doing this to us why are you betraying us we were to link up with
[1:42:54.460 --> 1:42:59.620]  Edward the 8th your king and take on the Soviets and set up a pan German
[1:42:59.620 --> 1:43:08.220]  British Empire run by a British monarch I mean did you know that was the
[1:43:08.220 --> 1:43:20.020]  official plan Prince Bernhard was going to be the king of Europe but then he got
[1:43:20.020 --> 1:43:23.300]  the word after the German invasion already began no actually come to England
[1:43:23.300 --> 1:43:27.500]  plans have changed so he took off his SS officers uniform when enjoying the
[1:43:27.500 --> 1:43:41.300]  other Nazi his cousin Prince Philip was he 81 82 now the Duke of Edinburgh this
[1:43:41.300 --> 1:43:50.460]  is high level ultra intrigue the British Royals have successfully double
[1:43:50.460 --> 1:43:57.220]  crossed all their other royal family branches and murdered all of them they're
[1:43:57.220 --> 1:44:04.420]  the only people standing did you know the Emperor of Japan bowels and is an
[1:44:04.420 --> 1:44:09.180]  on-scene on television goes to events every decade or so at the Tower of
[1:44:09.180 --> 1:44:12.660]  London to give field into the Queen as the head of all royalty worldwide
[1:44:12.660 --> 1:44:16.980]  because if you don't she'll overthrow your country and kill you the British
[1:44:16.980 --> 1:44:22.420]  engineered World War two and a 30-year plan and over through Japan that's why
[1:44:22.420 --> 1:44:30.620]  he bows to her that woman over there rules the planet with the Rothschilds
[1:44:30.620 --> 1:44:38.220]  who've married in with them this is a super breed of all the world's elite
[1:44:38.220 --> 1:44:52.660]  inner bread they didn't like their cousins the czars who'd stopped the the
[1:44:52.660 --> 1:44:58.340]  breakup of the US and during the Civil War in the 1860s they had gotten out of
[1:44:58.340 --> 1:45:02.300]  favor with each other so the British Royals along with the United States and
[1:45:02.300 --> 1:45:08.380]  Army Intelligence hired 8,000 thugs out of Brooklyn and gave them weapons and
[1:45:08.380 --> 1:45:11.540]  gold and sent them over there to overthrow that country and that's
[1:45:11.540 --> 1:45:18.260]  mainline history our criminal government created the United Nations in 1945 the
[1:45:18.260 --> 1:45:23.060]  Rockefellers gave him the land for it our criminal government created the
[1:45:23.060 --> 1:45:32.460]  communist scourge and as soon as McCarthy figured that out he was destroyed oh he
[1:45:32.460 --> 1:45:36.860]  was very useful to set up warrantless wiretapping and spying and torture and
[1:45:36.860 --> 1:45:41.780]  bullying the media to do what they were told setting the precedent for
[1:45:41.780 --> 1:45:48.380]  censorship for the Pentagon and the FBI oh it was very useful when it was just a
[1:45:48.380 --> 1:45:55.940]  ground-level commie scourge but when McCarthy found out it was run out of the
[1:45:55.940 --> 1:46:01.300]  White House when he found out the whole thing was run by big banks and started
[1:46:01.300 --> 1:46:07.700]  giving speeches they destroyed him overnight was he a hothead was he a
[1:46:07.700 --> 1:46:12.340]  guy that liked to drink yes but was he somebody who actually believed he was
[1:46:12.340 --> 1:46:17.820]  fighting evil yes so how does our military get to go out and take over
[1:46:17.820 --> 1:46:21.020]  the planet how do our military men go out and torture people and kill people
[1:46:21.020 --> 1:46:24.820]  and stage terror attacks well you got to do it because the Soviets do it and if
[1:46:24.820 --> 1:46:28.740]  we don't do it they're gonna win and they're gonna kill tens of millions and
[1:46:28.740 --> 1:46:34.580]  so we got to do it men and then decades later we got to do this men to the
[1:46:34.580 --> 1:46:39.180]  World Trade Center towers if we don't Muslim extremists will take over and
[1:46:39.180 --> 1:46:42.940]  kill millions so we'll kill thousands you understand the injustice the means
[1:46:42.940 --> 1:46:48.740]  yes sir it's just like triage that's right that's why you've been chosen for
[1:46:48.740 --> 1:46:52.500]  leadership in the past missions you're the only guardians we've got of Western
[1:46:52.500 --> 1:47:00.740]  civilization man we launched the operation in 62 days operation save
[1:47:00.740 --> 1:47:08.980]  America and they walked out proud of themselves that they were real men ready
[1:47:08.980 --> 1:47:23.260]  to blow up the towers real men but you've got all these people caught up in
[1:47:23.260 --> 1:47:26.860]  their left right paradigm and they can't see the forest for the trees and they
[1:47:26.860 --> 1:47:30.940]  can't get out of it and so right wingers will give up all their rights to the
[1:47:30.940 --> 1:47:33.940]  right wing and left wingers will do whatever they say as long as it's a
[1:47:33.940 --> 1:47:40.780]  Democrat and John doesn't like hearing communists talk bad about gee what are
[1:47:40.780 --> 1:47:51.660]  the fruits like a communism look at China look at Cuba look at Russia all I
[1:47:51.660 --> 1:47:54.900]  sees the same old tyranny I've seen dressed up a hundred different ways
[1:47:54.900 --> 1:48:05.580]  pal no the reason that maybe twice a year I'm on national television is because
[1:48:05.580 --> 1:48:08.940]  they've got to give us a teeny bit of a voice to give a little bit of the
[1:48:08.940 --> 1:48:13.420]  illusion that they have objectivity and that they're still relevant and pertinent
[1:48:13.420 --> 1:48:20.100]  and not obsolete and because if 90% of the public already knows about the New
[1:48:20.100 --> 1:48:26.180]  World Order the system's got to ease people into this now and just go ahead
[1:48:26.180 --> 1:48:29.180]  and admit it in plain view yeah there's a world government yeah we're
[1:48:29.180 --> 1:48:32.500]  poisoning you but it's for your own good you know that's the basic message they
[1:48:32.500 --> 1:48:39.460]  can't deny it anymore let's go back to the calls let's talk to chase in Texas
[1:48:39.460 --> 1:48:43.620]  and Julio Chris now there's go ahead howdy Alex thanks for taking my call
[1:48:43.620 --> 1:48:50.460]  thanks for holding yes sir I just want to make three brief key points number one
[1:48:50.460 --> 1:48:56.100]  soy SOI soy we need to get it out of our guy that super deadly they feed it to
[1:48:56.100 --> 1:48:59.660]  people in the prisons and they're dying in mass and becoming sterilized it's
[1:48:59.660 --> 1:49:03.540]  horrible yes sir it's lowering the testosterone levels of the men and
[1:49:03.540 --> 1:49:06.500]  that's one of the reasons why a lot of them are still sitting on their hands
[1:49:06.500 --> 1:49:10.340]  well it's not just that they picked a plastic that leaches it out of thousands
[1:49:10.340 --> 1:49:14.380]  they could have picked they put it in the water everything they do aspartame
[1:49:14.380 --> 1:49:19.380]  fluoride soy everything that's chosen and then there's even white papers how
[1:49:19.380 --> 1:49:24.260]  they chose it to sterilize you yes sir it's it's pitiful but what's that's why
[1:49:24.260 --> 1:49:27.740]  I take it so personal because I've been watered down as a man but I've
[1:49:27.740 --> 1:49:31.620]  supplemented it back because testosterone does occur in nature through
[1:49:31.620 --> 1:49:37.460]  spinach and a root called maca root but I digress so I don't want more
[1:49:37.460 --> 1:49:41.420]  testosterone I would like literally be attacking people every five minutes but
[1:49:41.420 --> 1:49:46.860]  yeah a lot of people have very low testosterone yes sir secondly
[1:49:46.860 --> 1:49:51.700]  c-span I've been watching Washington Journal here lately and in my opinion I
[1:49:51.700 --> 1:49:55.620]  think about 40 to 45 percent of the call-ins are starting to sound like
[1:49:55.620 --> 1:49:59.740]  folks like us who are well versed in the lives of manipulation that are taking
[1:49:59.740 --> 1:50:03.340]  place so I think that's exactly listen listen listen everybody's calling me I
[1:50:03.340 --> 1:50:07.660]  see clips that are put up on c-span where governor you know the former head
[1:50:07.660 --> 1:50:12.340]  homeland security turd off goes on and literally out of 2030 calls every
[1:50:12.340 --> 1:50:16.340]  caller but one were against him and knew he was new world order exactly that's
[1:50:16.340 --> 1:50:21.260]  what I mean they're in trouble folks go ahead yeah and and we just got to keep
[1:50:21.260 --> 1:50:25.420]  calling in and keep turning up the heat and my third point sir I really feel
[1:50:25.420 --> 1:50:31.020]  that in 2010 we've got a momentum behind us right now that we really never had
[1:50:31.020 --> 1:50:36.140]  and we're gonna carry this into this new year of 2010 and 2010 is gonna be a
[1:50:36.140 --> 1:50:39.500]  year start over chase I interrupted you a bunch stay there I'm gonna come back on
[1:50:39.500 --> 1:50:46.460]  here what you have to say the Julio chief that's a cool name Chris Travis and

[1:56:20.660 --> 1:56:24.300]  wonderful time to be alive because I don't know about y'all but I'm ready to
[1:56:24.300 --> 1:56:28.500]  be living like George Jessen and I do not want to turn back into Fred Flintstone
[1:56:28.500 --> 1:56:33.460]  and it's time that all of the innovation and the wonderful things that have been
[1:56:33.460 --> 1:56:38.620]  suppressed from us are out there for everyone that's another great point that's
[1:56:38.620 --> 1:56:42.460]  what this is all about chase I appreciate the call I'll say the
[1:56:42.460 --> 1:56:48.460]  cliche here I'll see you next year let's talk to Julio in Illinois Julio go
[1:56:48.460 --> 1:56:53.660]  ahead Alex Jones freedom fighter or conspiracy expert happy new year to you

[1:56:59.300 --> 1:57:02.260]  night conspiracy to your show I know you may not think it's not wasn't your
[1:57:02.260 --> 1:57:06.520]  favorite but it it everyone who is trying to spread the message of what's
[1:57:06.520 --> 1:57:09.820]  going on the world we try to explain people about the bill the burr group and
[1:57:09.820 --> 1:57:13.300]  there that there is a secret society that is controlling the earth so last
[1:57:13.300 --> 1:57:17.860]  night's show pretty much gave the groundwork for all the
[1:57:17.860 --> 1:57:21.860]  derelict people in this country to realize that yes there are people other
[1:57:21.860 --> 1:57:25.860]  than Barack Hussein Obama or George Herbert Walker Bush or George Walker
[1:57:25.860 --> 1:57:29.900]  Bush that run this country and with all the facts on the show it's actually
[1:57:29.900 --> 1:57:33.620]  getting people aware of what's going on secondly they talked about the Logan
[1:57:33.620 --> 1:57:37.820]  Act one more time and I think it's 2010 with all the fuel and all the ammunition
[1:57:37.820 --> 1:57:42.580]  that we have as info warriors we need to go out and start pressing these issues
[1:57:42.580 --> 1:57:46.460]  start going to the media and that's a big issue Hillary got it I appreciate your
[1:57:46.460 --> 1:57:51.140]  call Julio great points Hillary got a three hundred and something thousand I
[1:57:51.140 --> 1:57:56.020]  forget the exact amount over $300,000 fine for violating the Logan Act in the
[1:57:56.020 --> 1:58:00.860]  mid-1990s going to a Bilderberg and then now she just goes in front of
[1:58:00.860 --> 1:58:04.940]  everybody just like Rick Perry openly does to go discuss Texas politics and
[1:58:04.940 --> 1:58:10.300]  and policy and yeah they're just setting the precedent to do illegal things out
[1:58:10.300 --> 1:58:15.260]  in the open to just rub our faces in it great points Julio all right I'm gonna
[1:58:15.260 --> 1:58:21.740]  jam in Chris chief Travis D and others and Webster Tarpleys coming up on a host
[1:58:21.740 --> 1:58:29.860]  of issues looking into 2010 and then 2011-2012 and beyond I got a bunch of
[1:58:29.860 --> 1:58:34.700]  news we haven't even gotten to yet I'm gonna play clips from the Ventura show
[1:58:34.700 --> 1:58:40.020]  and analyze that in the last hour hey when I say it's not my favorite I love
[1:58:40.020 --> 1:58:51.140]  it thank you for listening to GCN be sure to visit GCN live comm today this is
[1:58:51.140 --> 1:58:54.540]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[1:58:54.540 --> 1:58:58.500]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[1:58:58.500 --> 1:59:02.740]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[1:59:02.740 --> 1:59:07.020]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[1:59:07.020 --> 1:59:11.380]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[1:59:11.380 --> 1:59:15.420]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[1:59:15.420 --> 1:59:20.020]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[1:59:20.020 --> 1:59:24.180]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[1:59:24.180 --> 1:59:27.460]  families lose their power from weather-related onages number five a

[2:01:29.060 --> 2:01:35.060]  I'm a police officer in Florida doing it about 17 years I'm a little nervous
[2:01:35.060 --> 2:01:42.980]  now it's never talked national before can you hear me yes sir oh okay we got a
[2:01:42.980 --> 2:01:45.660]  little weird situation we're working out I want to do the city out right now I
[2:01:45.660 --> 2:01:50.100]  do that in private but we got a group of guys here at my department that they're
[2:01:50.100 --> 2:01:54.140]  on board that's what we call it when they're awakened and I became awakened
[2:01:54.140 --> 2:01:58.820]  back in like 96 I got home from work one night put on a tube and there was an
[2:01:58.820 --> 2:02:03.620]  infomercial about bohemian growth and it blew my mind when I saw that but anyway
[2:02:03.620 --> 2:02:08.500]  this particular officer two nights ago was about two o'clock in morning he's
[2:02:08.500 --> 2:02:12.500]  working a call for a missing girl and they were sitting up a perimeter in this
[2:02:12.500 --> 2:02:16.580]  area he came up in this building that's in like a small industrial area that we
[2:02:16.580 --> 2:02:22.340]  have and in the woods was a unmarked car like a police vehicle and the guy that
[2:02:22.340 --> 2:02:25.260]  got out was a security guard so he worked for Pinkerton he was guarding the
[2:02:25.260 --> 2:02:31.020]  building that was in the area and this officer he's you know talking this guy
[2:02:31.020 --> 2:02:35.580]  it's two o'clock in morning and the guy says the building just you know it's
[2:02:35.580 --> 2:02:39.820]  owned by an Israeli corporation and you remember fable enemies you guys were
[2:02:39.820 --> 2:02:43.820]  talking about the routers and the cell phone things that they control and they
[2:02:43.820 --> 2:02:50.260]  can monitor cell phone controls like 95% of it well I think I found one man it's
[2:02:50.260 --> 2:02:53.460]  pretty interesting this building this is four to five cameras everywhere they
[2:02:53.460 --> 2:02:58.620]  get an armed security guard that works for Pinkerton and he actually had the
[2:02:58.620 --> 2:03:01.660]  officer smart he's talking to guys so and when the guy says hey it's owned by
[2:03:01.660 --> 2:03:06.540]  the Israelis they manufacture supposedly missile guidance systems and the
[2:03:06.540 --> 2:03:09.380]  officers working on me like well hey can I go in you know you're about your
[2:03:09.380 --> 2:03:11.980]  restroom and stuff the guy's like well no I'm not supposed to put nobody in
[2:03:11.980 --> 2:03:15.700]  anyway he goes in there and he comes out and the guy says hey you want to see
[2:03:15.700 --> 2:03:19.860]  something cool and he brings them in in this room as a giant mainframe computer
[2:03:19.860 --> 2:03:23.460]  and this as far as he could go he said he couldn't get no farther they had to
[2:03:23.460 --> 2:03:26.700]  wear special suits to get around it and stuff and I guess the other portion of
[2:03:26.700 --> 2:03:31.140]  the building what you didn't see was us manufacturing and he said a couple days
[2:03:31.140 --> 2:03:35.460]  ago or Israeli big week showed up and actually a fire or something removed to
[2:03:35.460 --> 2:03:39.900]  either guys from inside they're all mad and stuff but I go over there I he
[2:03:39.900 --> 2:03:42.740]  called me the morning tells you about this I get the work I go over and look
[2:03:42.740 --> 2:03:47.980]  at it and sure enough man the place is completely surrounded by cameras they
[2:03:47.980 --> 2:03:52.180]  got some kind of weird antennas on the side of it I got pictures oh yeah look
[2:03:52.180 --> 2:03:56.500]  there are foreign government spy bases everywhere and no one's got spy bases
[2:03:56.500 --> 2:04:01.220]  bigger than Israel and they're allowed to spy that's the difference and and yes
[2:04:01.220 --> 2:04:06.980]  the Israeli government runs the caller ID phone tracking systems they also run
[2:04:06.980 --> 2:04:10.900]  the protection of nukes in the US our own Pentagon isn't allowed to do that
[2:04:10.900 --> 2:04:17.860]  because again our government can go go with the client state an outside
[2:04:17.860 --> 2:04:22.540]  government that's another wall of secrecy that our own Congress can't get to
[2:04:22.540 --> 2:04:26.740]  Israel gets to know more about Homeland Security than Congress does remember
[2:04:26.740 --> 2:04:30.380]  last year when the congressman wanted to see the Homeland Security plan under
[2:04:30.380 --> 2:04:33.460]  PD 51 and he was told you're not allowed to see it even though it was on the
[2:04:33.460 --> 2:04:38.180]  Homeland Security Committee but then Israel gets to be on the Pentagon
[2:04:38.180 --> 2:04:42.100]  Northcom Homeland Security system stay there I want you to be able to finish up
[2:04:42.100 --> 2:04:46.720]  on the other side of this break Chris in Florida then we're going to Webster

[2:08:10.180 --> 2:08:19.260]  you know it doesn't mean that Tala tech Tala dash com is doing anything wrong
[2:08:19.260 --> 2:08:24.140]  but it is important to keep our eyes on foreign-owned corporate governments and
[2:08:24.140 --> 2:08:28.740]  groups whether it be the Chinese the Israelis anybody I did look up Tala
[2:08:28.740 --> 2:08:33.540]  dash tech and its leaders in design development production of military
[2:08:33.540 --> 2:08:37.740]  industrial commercial communications equipment and that's just another
[2:08:37.740 --> 2:08:41.940]  example of how our country our military everything is dependent on foreign lands
[2:08:41.940 --> 2:08:46.300]  the opposite of what George Washington said we should do but I was asking the
[2:08:46.300 --> 2:08:51.700]  police officer calling in from Florida if a lot of the officers are waking up
[2:08:51.700 --> 2:08:55.100]  he told me off air a lot of the people that have been in a while are and are
[2:08:55.100 --> 2:08:58.260]  concerned and he was giving me some of the terms they have for the people that
[2:08:58.260 --> 2:09:03.220]  aren't awake so anything else you want to add about the mindset of the police
[2:09:03.220 --> 2:09:08.180]  you work with the awakening that's happening Chris from Florida well I
[2:09:08.180 --> 2:09:12.260]  think police in general you know they're I will tell you this the guys that are
[2:09:12.260 --> 2:09:16.820]  older been doing this maybe 10 years and longer are a lot for mindset than the
[2:09:16.820 --> 2:09:19.820]  ones are just coming in the ones that come in I'm not gonna be honest you
[2:09:19.820 --> 2:09:23.060]  man they're stupid I don't know what's going on they hire right out of college
[2:09:23.060 --> 2:09:26.860]  I don't know how they graduated college you know and stuff they came to function
[2:09:26.860 --> 2:09:31.180]  on the street and the guys you can think for themselves or the ones that are you
[2:09:31.180 --> 2:09:34.460]  know they're not gonna go along with any kind of programs that are just gonna be
[2:09:34.460 --> 2:09:38.140]  against our civil rights but uh I just found it interesting that this this
[2:09:38.140 --> 2:09:41.940]  company is owned by the Israelis and they're supposedly manufacturing and
[2:09:41.940 --> 2:09:46.460]  part of the building this will guide the systems you know and other thing the
[2:09:46.460 --> 2:09:49.740]  security guard he said the people they bring in the working manufacturers some
[2:09:49.740 --> 2:09:53.180]  of the spook items are making a calm egg heads and they're only allowed in
[2:09:53.180 --> 2:09:57.300]  portions of the building the Israeli or the other portion even the security guy
[2:09:57.300 --> 2:10:01.300]  was allowed to go in certain portions so and this wasn't your typical black and
[2:10:01.300 --> 2:10:04.700]  hot guard man this guy was had a he said he had a master's degree well-addressed
[2:10:04.700 --> 2:10:09.940]  he was out of pink routine from Chicago so the whole thing man just I don't know
[2:10:09.940 --> 2:10:13.980]  maybe so the issue is the the police officers you talk to and you've now
[2:10:13.980 --> 2:10:19.020]  checked the area out he got a bad feeling this what I'm getting is it had
[2:10:19.020 --> 2:10:23.260]  the feeling of a spook compound right and this officer is on board we've been
[2:10:23.260 --> 2:10:27.900]  discussing this stuff for around two or three years now and uh he's very well
[2:10:27.900 --> 2:10:31.700]  aware on board again means awake to what's going on yeah yeah it's just a
[2:10:31.700 --> 2:10:34.860]  little turn we made up and then that's a good term and then and then what do you
[2:10:34.860 --> 2:10:40.420]  call the police that love the system bootlickers I like to describe the guys
[2:10:40.420 --> 2:10:43.900]  that live on their knees instead of on their feet you know and they don't do
[2:10:43.900 --> 2:10:47.820]  anything admission administration wants and they'll all stab officers and back
[2:10:47.820 --> 2:10:50.820]  to get what they need and I think every job probably has that but sure
[2:10:50.820 --> 2:10:54.620]  everywhere has bootlickers yeah police work it's hard because you're working
[2:10:54.620 --> 2:10:58.220]  with these guys day-in-day out and if you could trust me no throw out stabbing
[2:10:58.220 --> 2:11:01.580]  back just so they get promoted or get some other job within the department
[2:11:01.580 --> 2:11:05.380]  well I just wanted to let you know what's going on these facilities are
[2:11:05.380 --> 2:11:09.500]  probably everywhere guy did say that uh pull the officer that this particular
[2:11:09.500 --> 2:11:14.020]  building and what they go going on there is very important the United States he
[2:11:14.020 --> 2:11:17.300]  said during the economic collapse toss you wouldn't have to worry about it they
[2:11:17.300 --> 2:11:20.540]  would try to keep it up and I mean I really don't know what it is it definitely
[2:11:20.540 --> 2:11:24.940]  looks like some kind of communications receiving facility and you know they
[2:11:24.940 --> 2:11:28.700]  up the way they had the air ducts and the air conditioners they definitely were
[2:11:28.700 --> 2:11:31.780]  trying to cool something down and they probably did have a manufacturing facility
[2:11:31.780 --> 2:11:35.300]  in there the whole place all the windows are tinted out a few windows that they
[2:11:35.300 --> 2:11:38.900]  have everything else was there was just you know there was no way to look inside
[2:11:38.900 --> 2:11:45.140]  so I got pictures I could send you this well what I would do is I would just put
[2:11:45.140 --> 2:11:49.700]  them up on an account somewhere I mean there's all those photo accounts and
[2:11:49.700 --> 2:11:53.140]  then send us a link good to hear from you call us back anything else develops
[2:11:53.140 --> 2:11:57.660]  and have a great new year and be safe all right keep up the fight man I'll try
[2:11:57.660 --> 2:12:04.900]  thank you listen the Pentagon spends more money in 2009 the numbers just came in
[2:12:04.900 --> 2:12:11.580]  saw this in the news last week then all 50 states combined all their budgets the
[2:12:11.580 --> 2:12:19.860]  banks have stolen latest Bloomberg numbers are out 27 plus trillion so we
[2:12:19.860 --> 2:12:23.780]  now have the numbers and more may come in later from it always comes in a few
[2:12:23.780 --> 2:12:38.780]  months late but so far 27 I forget the points it was 23 23.7 trillion and then
[2:12:38.780 --> 2:12:44.820]  4.5 trillion it's over 27 trillion the point is is that it's just massive I
[2:12:44.820 --> 2:12:49.700]  mean it's it's it's it's numbers you can't even get your mind around we're
[2:12:49.700 --> 2:12:53.380]  being robbed right now okay for the rest of the hour maybe a little bit in the
[2:12:53.380 --> 2:12:59.020]  next hour we're very honored to have Webster Griffin Tarpley who is a
[2:12:59.020 --> 2:13:05.580]  doctorate in history he also is decreed economist and the author of the

[2:13:14.140 --> 2:13:19.100]  analysis and he joins us now to talk about what happened in 2009 what's
[2:13:19.100 --> 2:13:28.620]  coming up in 2010 but also the underwear bomber and the FBI now being caught
[2:13:28.620 --> 2:13:33.220]  lying saying they didn't detain anybody else they didn't find a bomb saying no
[2:13:33.220 --> 2:13:37.620]  one brought this guy onto the plane now that's been confirmed that someone did
[2:13:37.620 --> 2:13:41.780]  but they won't say who they're they won't release the video tapes from
[2:13:41.780 --> 2:13:46.820]  Amsterdam how we saw the preconditioning the last month that
[2:13:46.820 --> 2:13:50.660]  Yemen had to be hit now this happens oh it came out of Yemen we got to hit
[2:13:50.660 --> 2:13:57.500]  Yemen you know the whole geopolitical strategy what this signals we knew that
[2:13:57.500 --> 2:14:01.980]  Obama would start launching false flags I had predicted aircraft bombings
[2:14:01.980 --> 2:14:06.580]  attempted bombings flew hype in January I was proven right that's all the
[2:14:06.580 --> 2:14:10.940]  preconditioning but Tarpley is again a real expert on this so we'll we'll get
[2:14:10.940 --> 2:14:14.500]  his predictions in his view on what's happening and then a little bit of the
[2:14:14.500 --> 2:14:20.020]  next hour I want to get his take on well the healthcare even the Liberals are
[2:14:20.020 --> 2:14:24.820]  waking up this is a giant ripoff to the insurance companies higher taxes less
[2:14:24.820 --> 2:14:31.620]  benefits Webster Tarpley it's good to have you here as we close out 2009 thank
[2:14:31.620 --> 2:14:35.860]  you very much Alex happy new year to you and all the listeners what does you
[2:14:35.860 --> 2:14:42.100]  think of that police officer calling in talking about a a intelligence nest yeah
[2:14:42.100 --> 2:14:47.700]  I guess I think that's that's converse info systems isn't that one of them yes
[2:14:47.700 --> 2:14:51.460]  anyway I think that we've written that up in in the you know 9-11 that they
[2:14:51.460 --> 2:14:58.220]  were they were able to monitor most US telephone conversations and now we
[2:14:58.220 --> 2:15:03.460]  learn a month ago that all of the text messages phone messages everything was
[2:15:03.460 --> 2:15:07.260]  just recorded from 9-11 and now they're releasing it the government and its
[2:15:07.260 --> 2:15:12.620]  private subsidiaries are just recording everything we're so free Webster well
[2:15:12.620 --> 2:15:16.660]  that's that's a question national security agency but maybe I just to take a
[2:15:16.660 --> 2:15:21.140]  look now at the at the world's strategic picture because I think we have I think
[2:15:21.140 --> 2:15:26.000]  of a very ominous pattern I look for 2010 to be a very
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:30.660]  tempestuous time and we're gonna have I mean let's start with the kickoff the
[2:15:30.660 --> 2:15:34.420]  underwear bomber and then let's take your time going to all of it all right
[2:15:34.420 --> 2:15:38.980]  well I think it's it's obvious I'm sure you're obvious to you it's this is a
[2:15:38.980 --> 2:15:44.260]  controlled patsy and we have this the same pattern that we've seen again and
[2:15:44.260 --> 2:15:49.900]  again we have these individuals that have very limited mental equipment but
[2:15:49.900 --> 2:15:53.380]  nevertheless they're able to work miracles in the woods they can do things
[2:15:53.380 --> 2:15:56.940]  that a normal person would never be able to do you'd be arrested you'd be
[2:15:56.940 --> 2:16:01.820]  questioned you'd be searched you'd be stopped in some way rounded up but no
[2:16:01.820 --> 2:16:09.220]  in this case we have Omar Farooq Mutalab the son of this rich elitist
[2:16:09.220 --> 2:16:15.860]  oligarch banker from from Nigeria and he can do all these amazing things his
[2:16:15.860 --> 2:16:22.100]  own father goes to the US Embassy in Lagos Nigeria denounces him as a possible
[2:16:22.100 --> 2:16:27.580]  terrorist somebody who is probably at a camp of some kind in Yemen and this is
[2:16:27.580 --> 2:16:31.340]  shared by the the State Department and the CIA right off the bat and that seems
[2:16:31.340 --> 2:16:36.100]  to be sometime in about mid-November and nevertheless that's not enough to have
[2:16:36.100 --> 2:16:41.260]  his visa taken away he's got a US multiple entry visa which he's allowed
[2:16:41.260 --> 2:16:44.820]  to keep and of course you know you can have a stamp in the passport but if they
[2:16:44.820 --> 2:16:49.140]  change it in the computer then when you try to and he's traveling all over Italy
[2:16:49.140 --> 2:16:53.300]  all over Africa he's in countries illegally he gets out of countries he's
[2:16:53.300 --> 2:16:58.940]  disheveled looks like he's drugged stumbling around I mean this is classic
[2:16:58.940 --> 2:17:05.300]  right so he he's able then to basically had no effect he doesn't he doesn't get
[2:17:05.300 --> 2:17:11.740]  on any serious list of for scrutiny or special search and he's then able to buy
[2:17:11.740 --> 2:17:18.460]  a ticket a one-way ticket from Nigeria to Detroit and he buys it or somebody
[2:17:18.460 --> 2:17:24.460]  buys it in Ghana $2,800 in cash one way in cash that would normally get you
[2:17:24.460 --> 2:17:29.780]  searched or or something quite serious right there and he then reenters
[2:17:29.780 --> 2:17:34.300]  Nigeria illegally that doesn't seem to have any effect and then we have this
[2:17:34.300 --> 2:17:38.940]  famous story of the well-dressed Indian who accompanies him and I to me this
[2:17:38.940 --> 2:17:42.940]  suggests that he is a mental deficient he's in the same class with Richard
[2:17:42.940 --> 2:17:47.820]  Reed he's mentally retarded in some way and you can of course he could get a
[2:17:47.820 --> 2:17:52.820]  degree at University College London with the help of MI5 or maybe his father
[2:17:52.820 --> 2:17:56.620]  made a large contribution to University College London that stuff
[2:17:56.620 --> 2:18:02.900]  happens all the time so he's able then to to get into the he gets from one
[2:18:02.900 --> 2:18:08.540]  plane to another thanks to this patsy minder a patsy chaperone or patsy
[2:18:08.540 --> 2:18:13.300]  monitor the rich well-dressed Indian who makes an odd couple with him and that
[2:18:13.300 --> 2:18:17.060]  guy delivers him to the gate and says that he doesn't have a passport and I'd
[2:18:17.060 --> 2:18:21.220]  be interested to see is there a passport won't the FBI please show us a
[2:18:21.220 --> 2:18:26.700]  passport if there is one and then we have the FBI has been caught lying saying
[2:18:26.700 --> 2:18:30.820]  that there was no one videotaping on the plane no one else was pulled off at
[2:18:30.820 --> 2:18:34.660]  customs in Detroit now they've had to go back and admit they were lying they
[2:18:34.660 --> 2:18:41.260]  won't release the videos from from the European Airport from Amsterdam I mean
[2:18:41.260 --> 2:18:45.540]  this is suspicious oh yes I think it's beyond suspicious this is a clear case
[2:18:45.540 --> 2:18:50.180]  of a patsy so he's a controlled asset and of course it's not a matter of
[2:18:50.180 --> 2:18:53.780]  failure to connect the dots we're hearing all about the unconnected dots
[2:18:53.780 --> 2:18:58.740]  no this is the desired outcome we're dealing with the rogue network we'll
[2:18:58.740 --> 2:19:03.460]  be we're dealing with the same people that brought you again the the Gulf of
[2:19:03.460 --> 2:19:08.460]  Tanken incident the Kennedy assassination Iran contra 911 they nobody's
[2:19:08.460 --> 2:19:12.020]  ever laid a glove on them and the road network can't help themselves are going
[2:19:12.020 --> 2:19:15.100]  to break we're gonna come back and cover it they can't help themselves as they
[2:19:15.100 --> 2:19:19.460]  preposition troops in Yemen the last two months as they begin the hype a week
[2:19:19.460 --> 2:19:23.580]  ago that it's got to be hit and then right on time the patsy bombing comes
[2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:27.340]  and then and then right on time they they hype it like it's the end of the
[2:19:27.340 --> 2:19:33.020]  world throughout the weekend I mean this so when we come back finish up with
[2:19:33.020 --> 2:19:37.140]  the rogue network and what this signifies the new operations they're
[2:19:37.140 --> 2:19:42.780]  launching dr. Webster Tarpoli is our guest by the way we sell all four of
[2:19:42.780 --> 2:19:46.820]  his books that are in print got a bunch of other books on European history and

[2:19:55.940 --> 2:19:59.380]  you just take a look I saw the part from you yes but she reads French so that's
[2:19:59.380 --> 2:20:03.700]  good we'll be right back studies have shown that many people do not get the

[2:21:09.660 --> 2:21:13.740]  as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath
[2:21:13.740 --> 2:21:18.020]  the Americans at home. I've turned an endless influence on our president in
[2:21:18.020 --> 2:21:23.140]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[2:21:23.140 --> 2:21:28.160]  us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the
[2:21:28.160 --> 2:21:32.980]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying
[2:21:32.980 --> 2:21:37.700]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke
[2:21:37.700 --> 2:21:41.660]  and arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[2:21:41.660 --> 2:21:45.500]  do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[2:21:45.500 --> 2:21:51.540]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the

[2:24:03.060 --> 2:24:06.500]  Alright I got a lot of stuff I want to talk about. Let's start with me and take
[2:24:06.500 --> 2:24:16.100]  your phone calls. The final radio show of 2009. 2009 is a very long beard. He's
[2:24:16.100 --> 2:24:21.220]  very old. In a new year a babe will be dumped out into the world at midnight
[2:24:21.220 --> 2:24:25.220]  tonight in your time zone. Okay Webster without me interrupting there's just so
[2:24:25.220 --> 2:24:29.420]  much evidence. You're talking about rogue networks all the fingerprints, the
[2:24:29.420 --> 2:24:34.780]  classic MO, the signature, the wavelength, the smell, the red-handedness, then the
[2:24:34.780 --> 2:24:39.140]  media hype, the motive, the new initiative. Oh we've all got to have body
[2:24:39.140 --> 2:24:44.020]  scanners. We've all I mean just so many initiatives they're launching with this.
[2:24:44.020 --> 2:24:49.100]  It's just like with the flu inoculations we saw that hype and now
[2:24:49.100 --> 2:24:53.700]  we have the memos that it was all hype. Clearly a staged event. What is the goal
[2:24:53.700 --> 2:24:58.420]  continuing? Well the rogue network of course is a private network that cuts
[2:24:58.420 --> 2:25:02.540]  across the various agencies and executive departments of the US and
[2:25:02.540 --> 2:25:07.700]  other governments. Big British, British role is quite big. So it's the city of
[2:25:07.700 --> 2:25:12.380]  London and Wall Street controlling this network with their ideas of strategy.
[2:25:12.380 --> 2:25:17.500]  Let me just point out a couple of other things here. We're told that this
[2:25:17.500 --> 2:25:23.580]  alleged bomber, right, the Nicarabama, whatever they call him, he was in contact
[2:25:23.580 --> 2:25:29.500]  with his character Owlaki in Yemen and of course this Owlaki, I call him Owlaki
[2:25:29.500 --> 2:25:34.380]  the CIA lackey. Owlaki the lackey and remember he's a CIA lackey. He's a
[2:25:34.380 --> 2:25:39.780]  double agent, a triple agent if you want. He is used as a kind of beacon to
[2:25:39.780 --> 2:25:43.780]  recruit patsies across the world and they can only ship dip somebody like
[2:25:43.780 --> 2:25:48.060]  Major Hassan if they want to say you're linked to Al Qaeda. They just have you
[2:25:48.060 --> 2:25:52.780]  exchange a few emails with this Owlaki and that's what he's good for, right? He
[2:25:52.780 --> 2:25:58.300]  goes back to 9-11 in Hanihan Jure and Toronto. He's like how Turner was to the
[2:25:58.300 --> 2:26:02.820]  white supremacist who I said for the decade was FBI and now it's Chicago
[2:26:02.820 --> 2:26:07.700]  Tribune Associated Press that he's FBI deep cover controlling everything and
[2:26:07.700 --> 2:26:12.740]  I mean obviously he was FBI, same thing with the lackey. Right exactly. So this
[2:26:12.740 --> 2:26:17.820]  this guy is he's a US agent under whatever layers of gov that he's got.
[2:26:17.820 --> 2:26:24.460]  The other thing is how was this young patsy Omar Farooq Mutala, how was he
[2:26:24.460 --> 2:26:28.060]  radicalized and I think we're getting some pretty good indications that it's
[2:26:28.060 --> 2:26:33.160]  Brixton Mosk, Finsbury Mosk, Axis in London, the school for patsies, the
[2:26:33.160 --> 2:26:38.540]  British patsies. Which by the way six months ago I remember it you predicted
[2:26:38.540 --> 2:26:44.940]  we'd see plane bombings out of that Mosk. Yeah well again this is not so hard
[2:26:44.940 --> 2:26:49.400]  to do. Remember Richard Reed, Richard Reed mentally retarded vagrant who was
[2:26:49.400 --> 2:26:53.860]  sleeping on the floor of Brixton Mosk I think or Finsbury, one of the others, one
[2:26:53.860 --> 2:26:59.580]  or the other. He's he was given the same PETN explosive by somebody so that's
[2:26:59.580 --> 2:27:05.780]  what this this Omar Farooq was given then allegedly once again in in Yemen. So
[2:27:05.780 --> 2:27:09.940]  you can see it all it fits together and it all comes from these same these
[2:27:09.940 --> 2:27:17.900]  same places. Now again why again why Yemen? We have to remember that then this
[2:27:17.900 --> 2:27:23.460]  gets us into the big picture. Saudi Arabia is of course a crucial pillar
[2:27:23.460 --> 2:27:28.420]  of the Anglo-American world empire and we've had we've seen in the course of
[2:27:28.420 --> 2:27:34.100]  this year strong what we can we can call centripetal tendencies in other words
[2:27:34.100 --> 2:27:38.820]  desire by various people in Saudi Arabia to get out from under this US
[2:27:38.820 --> 2:27:42.660]  protectorate and the form that it took around August I think was Prince
[2:27:42.660 --> 2:27:48.420]  Bandar of all people. Bandar Bush yes changing his strategic orientation and
[2:27:48.420 --> 2:27:53.420]  becoming the great friend of Putin and Russia trying to bring in Russia and I
[2:27:53.420 --> 2:27:57.940]  would think China to try to redress the balance and gain some national
[2:27:57.940 --> 2:28:02.660]  independence for Saudi Arabia not to be tied to the US especially at a time when
[2:28:02.660 --> 2:28:07.660]  the US is undoubtedly preparing some kind of a people power coup or velvet
[2:28:07.660 --> 2:28:12.940]  revolution inside Saudi Arabia. And so where's Bandar oh from from the Godfather
[2:28:12.940 --> 2:28:18.620]  you won't see him no more he's now been disappeared. Yeah he's under house arrest
[2:28:18.620 --> 2:28:22.300]  or maybe you know more but I haven't seen anything about him since about
[2:28:22.300 --> 2:28:26.980]  August but there is a big fight about the royal succession and that is that is
[2:28:26.980 --> 2:28:33.100]  very prominent in Middle East news organs. Now Yemen the short thing on Yemen
[2:28:33.100 --> 2:28:37.940]  is this is this is a very very poor country and they had a whole colonial
[2:28:37.940 --> 2:28:45.060]  history with the British right back in the 60s was a big colonial anti-British
[2:28:45.060 --> 2:28:50.700]  guerrilla warfare going on. Right now though it's a government that is
[2:28:50.700 --> 2:28:56.620]  Sunni in its composition and allied to Saudi Arabia so that's the that's the
[2:28:56.620 --> 2:29:01.580]  central government in Sana under President Saleh of Yemen but there is
[2:29:01.580 --> 2:29:07.420]  this rebellion going the housey rebels who are Shiites and they are backed by
[2:29:07.420 --> 2:29:14.820]  Iran and we've had the US bombing this twice in the past month or so fairly
[2:29:14.820 --> 2:29:19.740]  large-scale stuff either with these drones or with with warplanes. Now here's
[2:29:19.740 --> 2:29:26.340]  a big thing the US is visually building up Al Qaeda Al Qaeda the CIA Muslim
[2:29:26.340 --> 2:29:31.700]  Legion is being actively built up by the US inside Yemen to make that civil war
[2:29:31.700 --> 2:29:36.060]  much worse and to get the Saudis and the Iranians at each other's throats maybe
[2:29:36.060 --> 2:29:42.460]  at war in Yemen. Let's talk about where you think that's going the wider
[2:29:42.460 --> 2:29:48.460]  geopolitical reasons for this in the grand strategy let's go into the mind of
[2:29:48.460 --> 2:29:54.340]  Zbigniew Brzezinski when we get back. We're on the march the Empire's on the
[2:29:54.340 --> 2:30:02.620]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good
[2:30:02.620 --> 2:30:06.620]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[2:30:06.620 --> 2:30:10.420]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[2:30:10.420 --> 2:30:14.780]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[2:30:14.780 --> 2:30:19.140]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[2:30:19.140 --> 2:30:23.580]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[2:30:23.580 --> 2:30:28.340]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[2:30:28.340 --> 2:30:32.140]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[2:30:32.140 --> 2:30:35.780]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[2:30:35.780 --> 2:30:40.100]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[2:30:40.100 --> 2:30:43.260]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[2:30:43.260 --> 2:30:46.940]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[2:31:02.140 --> 2:31:05.820]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[2:31:05.820 --> 2:31:10.540]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[2:31:10.540 --> 2:31:14.460]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[2:31:14.460 --> 2:31:18.340]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[2:31:18.340 --> 2:31:23.300]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[2:31:23.300 --> 2:31:28.580]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[2:31:28.580 --> 2:31:33.180]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[2:31:33.180 --> 2:31:37.380]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[2:31:37.380 --> 2:31:42.260]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[2:32:01.420 --> 2:32:06.180]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[2:32:06.180 --> 2:32:10.740]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[2:32:10.740 --> 2:32:14.340]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[2:32:14.340 --> 2:32:19.220]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[2:32:19.220 --> 2:32:24.020]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[2:32:24.020 --> 2:32:28.380]  citizens to pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our
[2:32:28.380 --> 2:32:33.620]  nation the criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[2:32:33.620 --> 2:32:37.940]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists
[2:32:37.940 --> 2:32:41.420]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[2:32:41.420 --> 2:32:46.660]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[2:32:46.660 --> 2:32:52.340]  have seen a fall of the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on dvd
[2:32:52.340 --> 2:32:57.700]  at info wars.com we're watching online right now in super high quality at
[2:32:57.700 --> 2:33:22.700]  prisonplanet.tv
[2:33:22.700 --> 2:33:27.100]  we're getting ready to close out the year it's my last live transmission is
[2:33:27.100 --> 2:33:31.980]  December 31st 2009 on this Thursday edition Webster Tarpley is our guest you
[2:33:31.980 --> 2:33:37.420]  know we had Kurt Haskell back on one of the eyewitnesses and other eyewitnesses
[2:33:37.420 --> 2:33:41.540]  are confirming another man was pulled off the plane Bob sniffing dogs went up to
[2:33:41.540 --> 2:33:45.100]  it the FBI said we got to get you out of here there may be a bomb then they
[2:33:45.100 --> 2:33:48.780]  lied and said that it never happened here's the headline from Michigan live
[2:33:48.780 --> 2:33:56.620] .com the big news site in Michigan flight 253 out eyewitness authorities are
[2:33:56.620 --> 2:34:02.980]  lying about terror attack and of course people accuse us of sensationalism
[2:34:02.980 --> 2:34:07.580]  that's what the headline says for mainstream news the article Paul Watson
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:13.620]  wrote about it was had a very very tame headline like I have it here in my
[2:34:13.620 --> 2:34:19.860]  stack but but we have eyewitnesses saying this is open lying going on and
[2:34:19.860 --> 2:34:24.220]  that's the kind of headlines we need an info wars.com and prisonplanet.com the
[2:34:24.220 --> 2:34:28.180]  establishment tries to intimidate alternative news people into watering
[2:34:28.180 --> 2:34:34.540]  down what we say watering down what we do into mediating facts facts or facts you
[2:34:34.540 --> 2:34:38.300]  can have your own opinions but you can't have your own facts and Watson
[2:34:38.300 --> 2:34:42.420]  everybody are doing a great job it's just that the mainstream media realizes
[2:34:42.420 --> 2:34:46.100]  the bombshell nature of those interviews we did the last few days I
[2:34:46.100 --> 2:34:50.860]  don't think we do I don't think the listeners do I don't think people
[2:34:50.860 --> 2:34:54.940]  understand this is really a staged event in front of us with a patsy
[2:34:54.940 --> 2:35:00.820]  there's no other way to see it and I don't think people realize just how big
[2:35:00.820 --> 2:35:06.980]  this is what's being kicked off I don't think people realize just how serious
[2:35:06.980 --> 2:35:12.300]  this is what's being set off what's being launched Webster Tarpoli breaking
[2:35:12.300 --> 2:35:16.380]  down the larger geopolitical ramifications a lot of analysts saying
[2:35:16.380 --> 2:35:20.940]  this could be the beginning of World War three open talk hopefully it's not the
[2:35:20.940 --> 2:35:26.380]  case more saber-rattling about striking Iran Israel said they may strike Iran
[2:35:26.380 --> 2:35:31.420]  Iran saying they'll strike back what that will do what do you think the
[2:35:31.420 --> 2:35:36.220]  globalist are testing what are the Anglo-American establishment doing right
[2:35:36.220 --> 2:35:40.940]  now where do you see this going this talk about going into Africa Somalia
[2:35:40.940 --> 2:35:48.340]  Sudan not just Aden and Yemen well first of all I would say the the the the use
[2:35:48.340 --> 2:35:52.820]  of Yemen Yemen is the place where you play Saudi Arabia against Iran and I
[2:35:52.820 --> 2:35:56.220]  think this is what has changed compared to Bush in other words the Obama
[2:35:56.220 --> 2:36:00.220]  administration knows that they are too weak to do these attacks so they've got
[2:36:00.220 --> 2:36:04.380]  to get other people to do them they want to attack Pakistan they know they can't
[2:36:04.380 --> 2:36:09.060]  attack Pakistan they've got to use push to understand and Balochistan and get a
[2:36:09.060 --> 2:36:13.700]  rebellion going inside Pakistan that with Yemen it's the civil war going on
[2:36:13.700 --> 2:36:19.380]  the US before the eyes of the world is massively building up al-Qaeda and the
[2:36:19.380 --> 2:36:23.580]  way they're doing it is by transferring people from Guantanamo right it's now
[2:36:23.580 --> 2:36:29.140]  all over the news that the number two man of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula a
[2:36:29.140 --> 2:36:34.660]  complete US creation is actually somebody who was in Guantanamo and I we
[2:36:34.660 --> 2:36:41.380]  can see from Iranian press TV that the they accused the US of transferring
[2:36:41.380 --> 2:36:46.660]  terrorist fighters from all over from Bagram in Afghanistan from all the
[2:36:46.660 --> 2:36:50.780]  prisons and all the black sites that they have across the Middle East those
[2:36:50.780 --> 2:36:56.900]  are now being massed in Yemen to create an al-Qaeda striking force inside Yemen
[2:36:56.900 --> 2:37:01.860]  that can be used to make this civil war worse right they can tack back and forth
[2:37:01.860 --> 2:37:06.140]  you know fighting one fighting another setting off bombs getting the Saudis to
[2:37:06.140 --> 2:37:11.700]  do more air attacks getting the Iranians embroiled more so this is going on
[2:37:11.700 --> 2:37:14.460]  before the eyes of the world and if you read carefully in the Wall Street
[2:37:14.460 --> 2:37:18.100]  Journal in the Washington Post you can see that they're saying it's probably
[2:37:18.100 --> 2:37:22.180]  not a good idea to transfer so many al-Qaeda people from Guantanamo back
[2:37:22.180 --> 2:37:26.100]  into Yemen but that is exactly the goal in the word this is not a not an
[2:37:26.100 --> 2:37:31.660]  unintended consequence it is the intended consequence now I do not see an
[2:37:31.660 --> 2:37:36.580]  attack on Iran and I'll tell you why the approach to Iran is essentially what
[2:37:36.580 --> 2:37:41.540]  I've been saying is to get Iran fighting Saudi Arabia now this was sort of the
[2:37:41.540 --> 2:37:46.820]  pattern no I'm sure I gotta stop you I remember almost two years ago you said
[2:37:46.820 --> 2:37:50.860]  they're gonna play Saudi Arabia off against Iran in proxy wars you said
[2:37:50.860 --> 2:37:55.980]  they're gonna try to overthrow Iran internally and exactly what you said
[2:37:55.980 --> 2:37:59.660]  happened that's why we have you on so much I mean you're one of the only
[2:37:59.660 --> 2:38:04.820]  people in the world who actually gets it and it's not that TV pundits don't get
[2:38:04.820 --> 2:38:09.500]  it they're always talking nonsense because the public is fed on a diet of
[2:38:09.500 --> 2:38:14.380]  nonsense you've read Brzezinski's books you understand the geopolitical
[2:38:14.380 --> 2:38:19.020]  strategy of the Anglo-American establishment explain to people how you
[2:38:19.020 --> 2:38:24.580]  knew this two years ago well part of it is from from reading these books and part
[2:38:24.580 --> 2:38:29.060]  of it is just from having observed them for it seems like about 40 or 50 years
[2:38:29.060 --> 2:38:35.820]  by now since I was a child but look concerning this Yemen business that's
[2:38:35.820 --> 2:38:39.860]  one approach to getting Iran into trouble the other thing is remember that
[2:38:39.860 --> 2:38:44.700]  when the US and the British foment the rebellion of Baluchistan that will
[2:38:44.700 --> 2:38:50.180]  carve up not just Pakistan but also Iran so there's another approach let's also
[2:38:50.180 --> 2:38:55.220]  remember that they've got this thing in Arabistan the oil area of Iran has an
[2:38:55.220 --> 2:39:01.020]  Arab population and that's where we have this Akhvaz or Arabistan Liberation
[2:39:01.020 --> 2:39:04.780]  Front what I always called BP British Petroleum Liberation Front because
[2:39:04.780 --> 2:39:10.100]  that's what it is and of course you've got this green coup the CIA faction in
[2:39:10.100 --> 2:39:15.340]  Iran the death to Russia death to China faction around Musavi and Rafsan
[2:39:15.340 --> 2:39:20.300]  Johnny now here's the thing if anybody bombs Iran it's an open secret that the
[2:39:20.300 --> 2:39:25.300]  past Iran Revolutionary Guards will simply exterminate all the leaders of
[2:39:25.300 --> 2:39:33.340]  the so-called opposition Musavi Rafsan Johnny Katami this entire crew they'll
[2:39:33.340 --> 2:39:37.660]  all be found floating in the river so I don't see any attack on Iran as long as
[2:39:37.660 --> 2:39:42.420]  they can keep this people power coup velvet revolution postmodern coup
[2:39:42.420 --> 2:39:47.980]  thing going inside Iran so I think that's Iran now Pakistan is a different
[2:39:47.980 --> 2:39:53.020]  story Pakistan you got the massive escalation of the drone attacks you've
[2:39:53.020 --> 2:39:58.300]  got bombs going off inside Pakistan remember it's it's Baluchistan and
[2:39:58.300 --> 2:40:02.500]  Pushtunistan that are supposed to rebel and in the past couple of weeks they
[2:40:02.500 --> 2:40:07.860]  added another aspect of it which is to play Shiites against Sunnis Pakistan is
[2:40:07.860 --> 2:40:13.500]  largely Sunni but there's a significant Shiite minority and we just had a bomb
[2:40:13.500 --> 2:40:19.180]  go off in Karachi which was targeting these Shiites to get them riled up so
[2:40:19.180 --> 2:40:23.500]  that in this case you'd be breaking up Iran according to four ethnic groups
[2:40:23.500 --> 2:40:31.740]  Baluchistan Pushtunistan Punjab and sinned plus along this Sunni Shiite line
[2:40:31.740 --> 2:40:35.940]  and by the way on every point you make you have giant reams of documents
[2:40:35.940 --> 2:40:48.260]  evidence in history let's not forget 2004 repeatedly 2005 2006 British US and
[2:40:48.260 --> 2:40:53.420]  Israeli contractors and regular military special air services out of England
[2:40:53.420 --> 2:41:01.660]  are caught in multiple events dressed up as Sunnis running around killing Shiites
[2:41:01.660 --> 2:41:06.460]  and US and British forces British got caught doing it even Ray McGovern
[2:41:06.460 --> 2:41:09.940]  former chief CIA analyst Ronald Reagan George Bush senior came on the show and
[2:41:09.940 --> 2:41:14.140]  said I believe the bombing of the Golden Mosque was US it came out a month
[2:41:14.140 --> 2:41:20.020]  later they evacuate the neighborhood US Army pulls up goes in and blows the
[2:41:20.020 --> 2:41:25.060]  mosque up in front of everyone and then blames it on another Muslim group to get
[2:41:25.060 --> 2:41:30.300]  the Shiites and and and and and Sunnis killing each other so this is just done
[2:41:30.300 --> 2:41:36.300]  out in the open this is standard procedure yeah Al Qaeda is the CIA Arab
[2:41:36.300 --> 2:41:42.540]  Legion it's now expanded to be the CIA Muslim Legion Al Qaeda in Iraq was
[2:41:42.540 --> 2:41:47.620]  created by General McChrystal when he needed it there had to be an Al Qaeda in
[2:41:47.620 --> 2:41:53.300]  Iraq for propaganda needs but also to prevent the Iraqi population from
[2:41:53.300 --> 2:41:58.260]  uniting against the invaders and the occupiers and now we've got the new
[2:41:58.260 --> 2:42:03.420]  one a QAP Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula which is another completely
[2:42:03.420 --> 2:42:07.980]  fake organization the interesting story happened to me I was on the radio with
[2:42:07.980 --> 2:42:13.340]  Algeria yesterday the Algerian radio in Algiers and they pointed out that there
[2:42:13.340 --> 2:42:16.900]  had been a statement from bin Laden about which I don't really know anything I
[2:42:16.900 --> 2:42:22.060]  wonder if you do that bin Laden had put out a statement attacking Iran and
[2:42:22.060 --> 2:42:27.660]  Hezbollah the the Shiite group there in Lebanon with Sheikh Nasrallah the people
[2:42:27.660 --> 2:42:33.620]  basically defeated the Israelis back in 2006 and this would be very very
[2:42:33.620 --> 2:42:39.100]  interesting to look into there's always been this idea of playing the Arabs
[2:42:39.100 --> 2:42:45.260]  Arabs and Sunnis you might say against Iranians and Shiites Iranians
[2:42:45.260 --> 2:42:49.740]  Persians Shiites that's one approach to the Middle East and that would be a
[2:42:49.740 --> 2:42:55.020]  typical Brzezinski approach it's also interesting bin Laden's family is
[2:42:55.020 --> 2:42:59.900]  supposedly at least some of them are being held prisoner in Tehran that when
[2:42:59.900 --> 2:43:05.620]  they when they fled out of Afghanistan so the story goes right after 9 11 some
[2:43:05.620 --> 2:43:09.580]  of them went into Iran and they were seized and they were put under house
[2:43:09.580 --> 2:43:13.220]  arrest some of them allegedly in the Saudi embassy see you see there's a
[2:43:13.220 --> 2:43:18.420]  hostility between Al Qaeda which the Iranians have always called the CIA
[2:43:18.420 --> 2:43:24.660]  operation and and the and the Iranian government now the bigger picture what I
[2:43:24.660 --> 2:43:30.660]  see going on is a tendency of the world to get out of control of the US and the
[2:43:30.660 --> 2:43:35.780]  British in other words the Empire is in a big a big crisis and its people are
[2:43:35.780 --> 2:43:40.660]  attempting to free themselves from this yoke just a couple of examples my
[2:43:40.660 --> 2:43:45.540]  reading of the Copenhagen conference is that this was torpedoed by a joint
[2:43:45.540 --> 2:43:51.460]  operation whether planned or unplanned by Russia and China in other words that the
[2:43:51.460 --> 2:43:55.700]  best account I can see is that those emails from the University of Anglia
[2:43:55.700 --> 2:44:01.060]  climate research unit were first uploaded by a server in Thompson in
[2:44:01.060 --> 2:44:05.980]  Siberia in Russia which is one of those old Soviet science cities that used to
[2:44:05.980 --> 2:44:11.340]  be off-limits to foreigners so comps in Siberia puts them up and then what
[2:44:11.340 --> 2:44:15.860]  happened in the conference was the Chinese blocked the attempt to impose
[2:44:15.860 --> 2:44:20.580]  these binding carbon targets which they realized would have been strangling
[2:44:20.580 --> 2:44:25.940]  the economic development of China and they worked together with Sudan so it's
[2:44:25.940 --> 2:44:31.500]  a kind of a united front Russia China Sudan defeated the Anglo-Americans and
[2:44:31.500 --> 2:44:37.500]  the European Union in the in the Copenhagen conference now further along
[2:44:37.500 --> 2:44:43.100]  the line in these countries you've got strong political signs of people who
[2:44:43.100 --> 2:44:48.340]  want to free themselves that would be Italy Japan and Saudi Arabia which we
[2:44:48.340 --> 2:44:52.020]  mentioned to some extent the Italian case is an interesting one why is
[2:44:52.020 --> 2:44:56.460]  Berlusconi targeted Berlusconi is targeted because he's a close friend of
[2:44:56.460 --> 2:45:00.900]  Putin he's involved with the South Stream oil pipeline which involves Russia
[2:45:00.900 --> 2:45:06.460]  Turkey Italy the French seem to be buying into this to some extent other
[2:45:06.460 --> 2:45:11.540]  countries in the Balkans are interested in it so Berlusconi gets gets hit in the
[2:45:11.540 --> 2:45:16.620]  face by this this massive heavy object there a couple of weeks before Christmas
[2:45:16.620 --> 2:45:21.380]  in Japan you've got the Hatayama government there was just a clash here
[2:45:21.380 --> 2:45:26.100]  at the State Department Hillary Clinton called in the Japanese ambassador and
[2:45:26.100 --> 2:45:31.300]  read him the riot act saying we the US demand that we move the Okinawa base
[2:45:31.300 --> 2:45:35.500]  from one part of the island to another and the Japanese don't like it so
[2:45:35.500 --> 2:45:39.980]  Hillary Clinton is on the warpath against Japan and I think underneath
[2:45:39.980 --> 2:45:45.300]  that in whatever confused or or or more complete form is a desire of the
[2:45:45.300 --> 2:45:49.820]  Japanese to assert some kind of national independence after being a ward of the
[2:45:49.820 --> 2:45:54.700]  United States for so many years and then Saudi Arabia it's interesting that in
[2:45:54.700 --> 2:45:59.020]  the past couple of weeks we've had a series of attacks on leading world
[2:45:59.020 --> 2:46:04.340]  governments the Pope is tackled on New Year's Eve what could have been an
[2:46:04.340 --> 2:46:09.180]  assassination attempt Shirak the former president of France who led the
[2:46:09.180 --> 2:46:15.860]  opposition in the world against Bush's Iraq war is indicted Berlusconi hit in
[2:46:15.860 --> 2:46:22.020]  the face by this object in Pakistan the president and the whole cabinet have had
[2:46:22.020 --> 2:46:26.860]  their immunity lifted so that the president is is the fearing this guy
[2:46:26.860 --> 2:46:31.820]  Zardari he fears criminal charges the defense minister is told that he's not
[2:46:31.820 --> 2:46:35.620]  allowed to leave the country and the interior minister the police minister
[2:46:35.620 --> 2:46:39.500]  is going to be subjected to an indictment so you can see there's an
[2:46:39.500 --> 2:46:44.300]  interesting pattern of things going on so if you look across the world you see
[2:46:44.300 --> 2:46:50.680]  resistance to London and New York coming from Russia China Sudan Italy Japan
[2:46:50.680 --> 2:46:57.860]  Saudi Arabia and of course the usual suspects Pakistan and and Iran each
[2:46:57.860 --> 2:47:02.980]  who is organizing that resistance or is that just happening organically I think
[2:47:02.980 --> 2:47:06.660]  some of its organized some of its organized some of it is simply ad hoc
[2:47:06.660 --> 2:47:11.900]  on the basis of you think it's Russian intelligence behind it no I think part of
[2:47:11.900 --> 2:47:17.340]  it is just it's a structural aspect of the world if the things are breaking up
[2:47:17.340 --> 2:47:21.540]  right we've just had the crisis of the whole Anglo-American banking system the
[2:47:21.540 --> 2:47:25.900]  degree of coordination well the degree of coordination between Berlusconi and
[2:47:25.900 --> 2:47:30.180]  Putin is total that's for sure there's no doubt about that one
[2:47:30.180 --> 2:47:36.140]  bond our friend of Putin once again Japan that that's a little bit less clear
[2:47:36.140 --> 2:47:40.100]  to me and now we have a major break though and I should interrupt finish that
[2:47:40.100 --> 2:47:44.220]  thought before I forget we know in putting coming out announcing we're
[2:47:44.220 --> 2:47:49.020]  gonna produce even more deadly nukes since you're still in circling us so
[2:47:49.020 --> 2:47:53.220]  that means that that that Obama three months ago saying I'm not gonna put the
[2:47:53.220 --> 2:47:57.740]  what the the missiles in we knew that was a classic fraud he always says one
[2:47:57.740 --> 2:48:03.100]  thing does another so we're seeing the world shift right now in what I see
[2:48:03.100 --> 2:48:08.460]  globally as a portend of World War three I mean if war start in a couple more
[2:48:08.460 --> 2:48:13.580]  places won't that be the makings of a world war well it doesn't have to
[2:48:13.580 --> 2:48:17.780]  become a world war I would compare it to Germany looking at Great Britain or
[2:48:17.780 --> 2:48:22.700]  Great Britain looking at Germany before before 1914 in other words the British
[2:48:22.700 --> 2:48:29.620]  are sitting there you know bankrupt rather decadent the Empire running out
[2:48:29.620 --> 2:48:34.180]  of steam and they see this rising industrial power of Germany which has
[2:48:34.180 --> 2:48:37.100]  got all kinds of problems but nevertheless they have a lot of economic
[2:48:37.100 --> 2:48:41.260]  growth and the British basically say well if we have a peace race with them
[2:48:41.260 --> 2:48:46.140]  we'll lose it the only way we can deal with them is to encircle them and have a
[2:48:46.140 --> 2:48:50.940]  war and I think you've got to remember the Wall Street people respond to the
[2:48:50.940 --> 2:48:54.580]  collapse of their financial structures when you have a world depression when
[2:48:54.580 --> 2:48:58.860]  you have a world financial collapse like this the response of London and Wall
[2:48:58.860 --> 2:49:02.660]  Street is to go berserk they go bunkers and they look around for these
[2:49:02.660 --> 2:49:07.620]  desperate crazy plans like who in his right mind wants to play Saudi Arabia
[2:49:07.620 --> 2:49:11.980]  against Iran what's the bait what's the benefit well they'd say well if we can
[2:49:11.980 --> 2:49:16.620]  get the price of oil up to $500 a barrel that will soak up all the dollars
[2:49:16.620 --> 2:49:20.540]  in the world and that will give the dollar a new lease on life because there
[2:49:20.540 --> 2:49:24.620]  won't be so many dollars exactly clearly they're desperate to create a world
[2:49:24.620 --> 2:49:29.700]  crisis to unify political support and to jack up commodities they're going to do
[2:49:29.700 --> 2:49:34.340]  it so what and I totally agree England the Milner group they said we ought to
[2:49:34.340 --> 2:49:38.860]  finance rabble Rousers to take over Germany Hitler we ought to fund the
[2:49:38.860 --> 2:49:43.980]  Soviets to threaten them we well I mean that came after World War one we ought
[2:49:43.980 --> 2:49:49.580]  to you'll kill their their leaders to get them to physically attack us I mean
[2:49:49.580 --> 2:49:53.100]  we're gonna see those same types of things now let me just also what would
[2:49:53.100 --> 2:49:57.980]  you point to with Putin is very important the the US and Russia are
[2:49:57.980 --> 2:50:05.380]  renegotiating a renewal of the strategic arms reduction treaty of 1991 it was
[2:50:05.380 --> 2:50:11.340]  signed under Bush the elder Bush the elder and and Gorbachev this expired on
[2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:14.740]  the 5th of December and all during the last couple of weeks that the word was
[2:50:14.740 --> 2:50:18.660]  coming from the State Department well it's just a few more little things we
[2:50:18.660 --> 2:50:22.580]  have to clear up don't worry we'll get to it but then Putin comes out and says
[2:50:22.580 --> 2:50:26.820]  wait a minute if you're gonna have a defensive shield of anti ballistic
[2:50:26.820 --> 2:50:30.740]  missiles and you're gonna deploy those in the Mediterranean and elsewhere we
[2:50:30.740 --> 2:50:35.580]  cannot discuss offensive weapons apart from defensive weapons we've got to put
[2:50:35.580 --> 2:50:41.220]  it all back together so it looks like Putin is blocking whatever you know
[2:50:41.220 --> 2:50:44.940]  ideas have been developed for a deal there will be no deal until Putin's
[2:50:44.940 --> 2:50:52.300]  demands are met so that is that's a quite a checkmate for for Obama well he
[2:50:52.300 --> 2:50:57.260]  said they're gonna come out with a new super topol and then the quote is here
[2:50:57.260 --> 2:51:02.020]  because quote the US things that can do whatever it wants will be right back you

[2:52:19.980 --> 2:52:24.780]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[2:54:31.720 --> 2:54:36.140]  spot-on to my own research always amazing to see you predict things so far
[2:54:36.140 --> 2:54:41.780]  out in the future so let's look into the future what do you see happening in the
[2:54:41.780 --> 2:54:50.740]  next year or catch words would be depression continued economic depression
[2:54:50.740 --> 2:54:56.100]  maybe getting worse in a second wave that could easily come in 2010 if not
[2:54:56.100 --> 2:55:06.460]  then then 2011 so depression and repression the repression is Obama I
[2:55:06.460 --> 2:55:11.300]  put out some interviews by the way people can see all this or hear it at
[2:55:11.300 --> 2:55:15.940]  tarply.net I finally got my website upgraded so if you haven't seen it I
[2:55:15.940 --> 2:55:19.820]  did the upgrades went up just a little bit before Christmas so if people
[2:55:19.820 --> 2:55:24.420]  haven't looked at it please do take a look tarply.net the idea being the
[2:55:24.420 --> 2:55:33.140]  comparison of Obama to Woodrow Wilson a pedant an elitist a professor Woodrow
[2:55:33.140 --> 2:55:38.060]  Wilson ran for president 1916 he was of course a Morgan puppet he had been put
[2:55:38.060 --> 2:55:44.260]  into office by JP Morgan who got rid of William Howard Taft to open the way for
[2:55:44.260 --> 2:55:49.580]  Woodrow Wilson like this is where we get the Federal Reserve system and a whole
[2:55:49.580 --> 2:55:54.700]  lot of other bad things and he ran on this week he kept us out of war right
[2:55:54.700 --> 2:55:59.420]  don't get into World War one so he wins the election in 1916 and then turns
[2:55:59.420 --> 2:56:03.100]  around as soon as he's back in office within a month he wants to declare war
[2:56:03.100 --> 2:56:08.060]  on Germany which he does do and then he passes the espionage act and the
[2:56:08.060 --> 2:56:13.300]  sedition act and throws up a couple of thousand people in jail it's light
[2:56:13.300 --> 2:56:18.540]  years orders of magnitude beyond Bush Cheney the worst civil liberties
[2:56:18.540 --> 2:56:23.860]  emergency in the US since the Civil War and that's Woodrow Wilson so you have
[2:56:23.860 --> 2:56:28.260]  Obama and lots of parallels right a Wall Street puppet Morgan puppet pretty
[2:56:28.260 --> 2:56:34.540]  much runs with this very very vague anti-Iraq war profile although there was
[2:56:34.540 --> 2:56:41.100]  also the pledge to escalate Afghanistan Obama is now losing his base the
[2:56:41.100 --> 2:56:45.300]  black community the people over at the black agenda report in particular up in
[2:56:45.300 --> 2:56:50.220]  arms and they're gaining in influence because the black unemployment is
[2:56:50.220 --> 2:56:55.220]  sky-high and Obama refuses to do anything the greens of course are unhappy
[2:56:55.220 --> 2:56:59.420]  because Obama was checkmated in Copenhagen the anti-war people in
[2:56:59.420 --> 2:57:03.980]  particular are becoming more and more active we had a very good demonstration
[2:57:03.980 --> 2:57:09.060]  here on the 12th of December with Kucinich Gravel McKinney and Ralph
[2:57:09.060 --> 2:57:13.740]  Nader and the left is now and the left is now found out that the health care
[2:57:13.740 --> 2:57:17.580]  plan is a giant robbery has nothing to do with their precious so let me just
[2:57:17.580 --> 2:57:21.980]  let me just mention there's going to be a demonstration specifically against the
[2:57:21.980 --> 2:57:27.940]  CIA drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan at at Langley at that CIA headquarters I
[2:57:27.940 --> 2:57:33.700]  think the 16th of January that's Cindy Sheehan and Cynthia McKinney and their
[2:57:33.700 --> 2:57:39.180]  group of the peace of the action PEA PE piece of the action so that's something
[2:57:39.180 --> 2:57:43.380]  so the anti-war people now making I think a comeback and that's that's of
[2:57:43.380 --> 2:57:48.180]  course most welcome as you say the fact that Obama has totally sold out to the
[2:57:48.180 --> 2:57:52.180]  private insurance companies and the private pharmaceutical cartel that's
[2:57:52.180 --> 2:57:56.940]  evident to everybody gay rights people very very upset because he hasn't done
[2:57:56.940 --> 2:58:00.940]  anything for them so what's gonna happen I mean I mean we know Obama that he's
[2:58:00.940 --> 2:58:04.980]  just a little puppet front man right right okay so I'm not really worried
[2:58:04.980 --> 2:58:08.900]  about what he's doing by the way in terms of the tax on governments right
[2:58:08.900 --> 2:58:11.860]  along with the pope getting tackled you're not getting indicted by los
[2:58:11.860 --> 2:58:15.820]  going to getting smashed in the face look at what happened to Obama two people
[2:58:15.820 --> 2:58:19.780]  led into the White House to two separate incidents where people walked
[2:58:19.780 --> 2:58:23.820]  walked right in it's a way for the rogue network to say to Obama follow orders
[2:58:23.820 --> 2:58:28.940]  because we can get you any time you think that's what the message is I think

[2:59:51.940 --> 3:00:01.380]  Waging War on Corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[3:00:13.900 --> 3:00:17.820]  all right Webster's gonna leave us in about 15 minutes I will get the calls
[3:00:17.820 --> 3:00:24.340]  that are holding there's so many other issues I want to get into I want to go
[3:00:24.340 --> 3:00:30.820]  over the decade of tyranny no doubt in modern history the last decade has been
[3:00:30.820 --> 3:00:35.420]  an incredible time of corruption and yes I know technically the decade isn't over
[3:00:35.420 --> 3:00:39.940]  for another year but the media started the millennium in 2000 they started the
[3:00:39.940 --> 3:00:48.980]  new century in 2000 that's like starting 10 at 9 or you know 21 at 20 but the
[3:00:48.980 --> 3:00:53.220]  point is the last 10 years has been an incredible time of tyranny but also a
[3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:59.320]  big time of awakening as the global banking empire tries to suck the last
[3:00:59.320 --> 3:01:03.820]  juices out of the United States to fund its tyrannical program all right
[3:01:03.820 --> 3:01:07.820]  Webster what do you see happening on the military front I mean you said war war
[3:01:07.820 --> 3:01:14.180]  war through proxies through destabilization campaigns through funding
[3:01:14.180 --> 3:01:19.260]  rebel groups what do you see domestically happening where do you see all
[3:01:19.260 --> 3:01:23.300]  this going as they try to tell us we've had a jobless recovery what do you see
[3:01:23.300 --> 3:01:27.540]  happening well let me cite a couple of predictions coming from others that I
[3:01:27.540 --> 3:01:32.900]  think are probably worthy of being considered remember the old able danger
[3:01:32.900 --> 3:01:40.420]  group in the DIA we had this Colonel Anthony Schaefer if you remember this
[3:01:40.420 --> 3:01:44.100]  this was Congressman Kurt Weldon Republican of Pennsylvania brought out
[3:01:44.100 --> 3:01:48.660]  this guy Colonel Schaefer and started to talk about able danger and the idea was
[3:01:48.660 --> 3:01:54.060]  of course that they had identified Ata and company well before 9-11 but they
[3:01:54.060 --> 3:01:58.780]  had these posted notes saying don't tell the FBI or don't tell anybody about
[3:01:58.780 --> 3:02:04.300]  this guy my view has always been that able danger were not hunting for
[3:02:04.300 --> 3:02:08.140]  terrorists they were supervising terrorists in other words they were
[3:02:08.140 --> 3:02:13.660]  patsy-minders patsy monitors patsy chaperones they were making sure that
[3:02:13.660 --> 3:02:17.940]  the Ata and company kept within the bounds of what they were supposed to do
[3:02:17.940 --> 3:02:23.300]  right that they they attacked you know when and and what was was wanted anyway
[3:02:23.300 --> 3:02:29.100]  Colonel Schaefer was on the Jerry Doyle radio talk show yesterday this guy's
[3:02:29.100 --> 3:02:35.540]  of sort of a moderate reactionary to neocon and Colonel Schaefer basically
[3:02:35.540 --> 3:02:39.340]  said well you know we haven't connected the dots again right we don't connect
[3:02:39.340 --> 3:02:43.780]  the dots the agencies don't talk to each other it's all bureaucracy the usual
[3:02:43.780 --> 3:02:48.380]  nonsense right to hide the obvious fact that these are protected patsy with
[3:02:48.380 --> 3:02:52.300]  more power and funds and get rid of your whole bill of rights
[3:02:52.300 --> 3:02:56.180]  let your rest feed the blood and directly into our mouths and maybe we'll
[3:02:56.180 --> 3:03:00.220]  save you save you from the deadly underwear bomber right so Colonel
[3:03:00.220 --> 3:03:05.140]  Schaefer says I don't think we'll ever wake up until a 10 kilo ton bomb goes
[3:03:05.140 --> 3:03:10.660]  off in an American city so that's that's his that's his view of the of the
[3:03:10.660 --> 3:03:16.060]  years ahead I would also add it doesn't have to necessarily be in the US there
[3:03:16.060 --> 3:03:19.700]  are some signs that might suggest someplace else of course Europe is always
[3:03:19.700 --> 3:03:25.100]  a big field of activity and if the goal is to get more European troops and more
[3:03:25.100 --> 3:03:30.820]  European money for places like Afghanistan play Europe against Afghanistan
[3:03:30.820 --> 3:03:34.940]  and Pakistan and that's that's certainly a possibility as you say the
[3:03:34.940 --> 3:03:40.340]  absurdity of the bureaucratic position is basically the more we fail the more
[3:03:40.340 --> 3:03:45.940]  power we demand and I would suggest the following John at the polytano alias
[3:03:45.940 --> 3:03:52.500]  totalitariano alias incompetano she should be fired or she should quit we
[3:03:52.500 --> 3:03:57.020]  don't know whether she's incompetent or whether she's complicit and we don't
[3:03:57.020 --> 3:04:00.300]  want to wait to find out we want to get her out Hillary Clinton at the State
[3:04:00.300 --> 3:04:05.380]  Department failed to pull the visa for this guy should be fired or made to
[3:04:05.380 --> 3:04:11.340]  quit Leon Panetta at the CIA should be fired or made to quit because but
[3:04:11.340 --> 3:04:16.180]  instead we reward failure right because they're really not failing they pulled
[3:04:16.180 --> 3:04:21.420]  off a great false flag let me let me finish my list Dennis Blair the
[3:04:21.420 --> 3:04:25.100]  intelligence are the head of the National Counterterrorism Center that
[3:04:25.100 --> 3:04:30.860]  couldn't get this patsy's name onto the no-fly list fire him James Jones the
[3:04:30.860 --> 3:04:35.220]  head of the National Security Council and overall responsible for all this
[3:04:35.220 --> 3:04:41.260]  stuff no no we'll punish him with more power stay there and there I have one
[3:04:41.260 --> 3:04:48.340]  other good plan that's John Brennan Obama's in-house White House security
[3:04:48.340 --> 3:04:52.300]  advisor Brennan fire him to no no no no we'll teach him we'll give him more
[3:04:52.300 --> 3:04:56.980]  power because they really did a great job and we're not gonna fire him for
[3:04:56.980 --> 3:05:02.540]  more drugs being on the street that's their job this is Alex Jones and I want

[3:07:04.060 --> 3:07:08.500]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[3:07:08.500 --> 3:07:12.660]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[3:07:12.660 --> 3:07:16.700]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[3:07:16.700 --> 3:07:20.580]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[3:07:20.580 --> 3:07:24.700]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[3:07:24.700 --> 3:07:29.020]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[3:07:29.020 --> 3:07:33.300]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[3:07:33.300 --> 3:07:37.020]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[3:07:37.020 --> 3:07:41.220]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[3:08:00.860 --> 3:08:06.700]  the Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[3:08:06.700 --> 3:08:11.460]  because there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:11.460 --> 3:08:19.700]  here's a headline on a Reuters you have no idea this is even true
[3:08:19.700 --> 3:08:28.740]  afghan attacks kills seven CIA employees five Canadians and the CIA
[3:08:28.740 --> 3:08:35.700]  Panetta says that there are plenty of people here who are capable and willing
[3:08:35.700 --> 3:08:40.860]  to make sure these people will be avenged like all the weddings you bomb to
[3:08:40.860 --> 3:08:46.900]  kill one person you'll kill 50 60 100 plus innocent people in a country you
[3:08:46.900 --> 3:08:52.500]  don't have a declaration of war against with drones in our own country they're
[3:08:52.500 --> 3:08:56.780]  arresting US citizens and holding them for years without charging them because
[3:08:56.780 --> 3:09:02.860]  they might have known al-qaeda we talked about this yesterday with Dr. Paul
[3:09:02.860 --> 3:09:06.900]  Craig Roberts I mean we've got about as many rights in this country as somebody
[3:09:06.900 --> 3:09:12.180]  did under Stalin they're just not out arresting the general public in mass
[3:09:12.180 --> 3:09:18.980]  without new process yet but we're moving towards that and again Webster what is
[3:09:18.980 --> 3:09:22.740]  the real war about in Afghanistan who are the real players we know opium
[3:09:22.740 --> 3:09:27.300]  production went from all-time lows to now upwards of 90% of opium production a
[3:09:27.300 --> 3:09:33.060]  10 11 12 13 14 time that depending on the number increase the world's flooded
[3:09:33.060 --> 3:09:38.420]  with opium I mean is this just a war against any little tribal holdouts
[3:09:38.420 --> 3:09:42.780]  that try to sell their own smack thus cutting into the banks
[3:09:42.780 --> 3:09:48.940]  laundering large s no it's a war against Pakistan above all Pakistan 160
[3:09:48.940 --> 3:09:53.740]  million people nuclear weapons strong ally of China economic partner of China
[3:09:53.740 --> 3:09:58.100]  has to be destroyed that the importance of Pakistan why did the West give help
[3:09:58.100 --> 3:10:03.140]  give them the nukes then they're a icon it's all you know the these imperialists
[3:10:03.140 --> 3:10:07.460]  we've a complicated web once they get started but here's the idea think of
[3:10:07.460 --> 3:10:12.940]  Pakistan is pipeline is done pipeline is done goes from Iran no I mean you
[3:10:12.940 --> 3:10:16.180]  hold Central Asia's Brazil's he said you can project power everywhere but I'm
[3:10:16.180 --> 3:10:21.260]  talking about economically right now is it the 500 billion in smack leveraged a
[3:10:21.260 --> 3:10:25.460]  5 trillion a year quite a juicy plum it is but this is that this is not the main
[3:10:25.460 --> 3:10:29.900]  object as far as I can see the object is to prevent pipelines from being built
[3:10:29.900 --> 3:10:36.260]  from the Iranian oil and natural gas fields across Pakistan over the Himalayas
[3:10:36.260 --> 3:10:41.420]  near K2 up there and into China this would then give China a guaranteed
[3:10:41.420 --> 3:10:45.700]  overland route for oil gas and other things that would go along with it
[3:10:45.700 --> 3:10:50.100]  rail links and and other things tanker port at Gorda which would then project
[3:10:50.100 --> 3:10:54.620]  their power into the region and not right and they were invented the magnetism
[3:10:54.620 --> 3:10:58.860]  of the Chinese economic dynamism would then begin to really weaken the US
[3:10:58.860 --> 3:11:02.420]  British position in the Middle East and you'd find people like Saudi Arabia
[3:11:02.420 --> 3:11:07.740]  looking to China rather than London and when we hear British American that
[3:11:07.740 --> 3:11:11.180]  doesn't mean the average Brit or Americans interest we pay for the
[3:11:11.180 --> 3:11:15.220]  private corporate empire we get nothing out of this right it means the city of
[3:11:15.220 --> 3:11:18.980]  London banks and the Wall Street banks the usual suspect here's the idea though
[3:11:18.980 --> 3:11:23.060]  that the two ethnic groups that have to be coated into into rebellion the
[3:11:23.060 --> 3:11:27.940]  Pashtuns are on both sides of this border so we're in Afghanistan to make
[3:11:27.940 --> 3:11:32.020]  sure there's a bigger rebellion in Pakistan to spread rebellion then into
[3:11:32.020 --> 3:11:36.020]  all the surrounding countries and then overthrow them and spread it into the
[3:11:36.020 --> 3:11:41.140]  next endlessly right so the Pashtuns are going to be occupied and
[3:11:41.140 --> 3:11:46.420]  antagonized on the Afghan side and then if they flee to the Pakistani side there
[3:11:46.420 --> 3:11:50.620]  they've got to be attacked by snipers again the Taliban say blackwater is
[3:11:50.620 --> 3:11:54.460]  there massively there's really no doubt about it according to the nation
[3:11:54.460 --> 3:12:01.540]  magazine also you've got blackwater with snipers with with various the
[3:12:01.540 --> 3:12:05.620]  sharpshooters and the snatch and grab kidnapping operation so if you're a
[3:12:05.620 --> 3:12:08.580]  Pashtun you're going to be driven to rebel you're going to be driven into
[3:12:08.580 --> 3:12:12.620]  the arms of the Taliban and the same story they've extended that now into
[3:12:12.620 --> 3:12:17.380]  Baluchistan and Baluchistan is the part that it goes over in into Iran so the
[3:12:17.380 --> 3:12:22.340]  entire goal of this operation is to promote a civil war inside Pakistan so
[3:12:22.340 --> 3:12:26.380]  that it's broken up and these pipelines can never be built and China can never
[3:12:26.380 --> 3:12:32.020]  get a guaranteed overland means of getting oil and that's what that was
[3:12:32.020 --> 3:12:37.380]  the main message of Obama's West Point speech also notice that now with
[3:12:37.380 --> 3:12:43.100]  Obama we have the new axis of evil right the Bush axis of evil was Iraq Iran and
[3:12:43.100 --> 3:12:48.620]  North Korea way back when the new axis of evil is now Afghanistan Pakistan
[3:12:48.620 --> 3:12:55.220]  and understood as one thing Somalia and Yemen so we're back to that new axis of
[3:12:55.220 --> 3:13:00.260]  evil at Africa here's the big question how is this gonna unfold the next year
[3:13:00.260 --> 3:13:05.500]  what is the goal of the Anglo-American global establishment versus what you
[3:13:05.500 --> 3:13:09.140]  think they're going to get and then what is there other goals around the world
[3:13:09.140 --> 3:13:13.340]  how are things going for them briefly well be the I think the dominant mood in
[3:13:13.340 --> 3:13:17.700]  Wall Street in London is desperation you saw that this this large Austrian
[3:13:17.700 --> 3:13:24.180]  bank Kupro Alpe Andrea went bankrupt 40 billion euros and now you've got this
[3:13:24.180 --> 3:13:28.980]  entire group of countries on the verge of sovereign default in other words state
[3:13:28.980 --> 3:13:36.300]  bankruptcy it's the so-called pigs group Portugal Ireland Italy Greece Spain and
[3:13:36.300 --> 3:13:41.260]  Greece seems to be the most immediate of that group so the idea is that the
[3:13:41.260 --> 3:13:46.860]  Greeks would try to auction some of their state bonds and nobody would come
[3:13:46.860 --> 3:13:52.500]  that could happen to the US right now the euro because of these complications the
[3:13:52.500 --> 3:13:57.140]  euro is collapsing faster than the dollar so the dollar has had a little bit of a
[3:13:57.140 --> 3:14:01.300]  reprieve in terms of the value of the dollar right the euro has been been
[3:14:01.300 --> 3:14:05.220]  going down and that has kind of masked the the weakness of the dollar but of
[3:14:05.220 --> 3:14:10.140]  course we know over here we've got the commercial real estate crisis those you
[3:14:10.140 --> 3:14:14.380]  know a trillion or more or less a trillion dollars of commercial real estate
[3:14:14.380 --> 3:14:18.300]  leases and other things that come up and a lot of that will go into into
[3:14:18.300 --> 3:14:22.540]  default so that's going to be another burden on the banking system maybe
[3:14:22.540 --> 3:14:27.260]  people notice general motors acceptance corporation GMAC just got another
[3:14:27.260 --> 3:14:31.300]  three to four billion dollar bailout and of course what that involves is
[3:14:31.300 --> 3:14:37.180]  die-tech funding like die-tech funding is or was GMAC and they went way into
[3:14:37.180 --> 3:14:41.460]  derivatives and that's what you've got so the the build-up you know we're
[3:14:41.460 --> 3:14:48.420]  about what a month since Dubai blue and in the month since Dubai you can see
[3:14:48.420 --> 3:14:53.060]  that the the rhythm of bank bankruptcies bank failures and just general
[3:14:53.060 --> 3:14:58.460]  financial turbulence across the world that has all increased so I think the
[3:14:58.460 --> 3:15:02.660]  depression will get worse the main goal of the U.S. and the British is to block
[3:15:02.660 --> 3:15:07.340]  the peaceful economic development of everybody else Russia says let's have
[3:15:07.340 --> 3:15:11.860]  the North Stream pipeline down the Baltic doesn't doesn't attack anybody
[3:15:11.860 --> 3:15:16.100]  U.S. and the British say no they said let's have the South Stream so you can
[3:15:16.100 --> 3:15:20.140]  get natural gas in southern Europe U.S. and the British say no and in the
[3:15:20.140 --> 3:15:24.780]  meantime look at China right they've they've got this fantastic high-speed
[3:15:24.780 --> 3:15:31.660]  rail from Canton Guangzhou up to Wuhan so it's a thousand kilometers about
[3:15:31.660 --> 3:15:35.700]  what 600 miles but we're not allowed to have that here because we have these
[3:15:35.700 --> 3:15:41.420]  Malthusian post-industrialist who openly say they want carbon taxes to put us
[3:15:41.420 --> 3:15:45.660]  into the Stone Age so they can make us more manageable they want everyone
[3:15:45.660 --> 3:15:51.540]  living in mud huts with loincloths but themselves up in their high-tech palaces
[3:15:51.540 --> 3:15:56.380]  I mean these are the worst most greedy control freaks ever known right and I
[3:15:56.380 --> 3:16:00.620]  would suggest that we need a stimulus I mean the U.S. economy is going to need
[3:16:00.620 --> 3:16:04.540]  massive stimulus but let's let's make it a real stimulus take them take that
[3:16:04.540 --> 3:16:08.980]  Chinese train which can go I think it's about it's about 200 miles an hour
[3:16:08.980 --> 3:16:13.220]  they're about we could do better than that we could get up to 300 maybe 400
[3:16:13.220 --> 3:16:17.420]  miles an hour allowed to with maglev but we could build we could build a New
[3:16:17.420 --> 3:16:23.620]  York to San Francisco transcontinental maglev that would really compete with
[3:16:23.620 --> 3:16:28.620]  it would have a lot of people into not traveling they don't that's the problem
[3:16:28.620 --> 3:16:33.820]  they want us living in slums while they live in palaces literally walking on
[3:16:33.820 --> 3:16:38.060]  platinum paved streets right and that that of course then poses the question
[3:16:38.060 --> 3:16:44.140]  of some kind of independent political organization if you look at what's
[3:16:44.140 --> 3:16:50.380]  happening that the leftists generally were completely duped by Obama in 2007
[3:16:50.380 --> 3:16:55.740]  2008 and I'm afraid the people going to the to the Tea Party rallies have now
[3:16:55.740 --> 3:17:00.180]  been duped by Dick army and the Republicans in Congress because when
[3:17:00.180 --> 3:17:05.060]  these when these Tea Party people come to Washington DC all they get are
[3:17:05.060 --> 3:17:10.340]  corporate globalist pro-federal reserve Republicans right there there's no
[3:17:10.340 --> 3:17:14.500]  Ron Paul that's right they're told you defeat the New World Order by the banks
[3:17:14.500 --> 3:17:19.340]  ruling everything and we've got to attack some more brown people that's how
[3:17:19.340 --> 3:17:24.260]  you really rebel and bought and and and and Obama's not attacking enough
[3:17:24.260 --> 3:17:28.780]  countries and we need more body scanners and just a year ago it was yay
[3:17:28.780 --> 3:17:33.100]  anti-New World Order down with the private fellow reserve now it's get the
[3:17:33.100 --> 3:17:39.940]  baker's more power body scan me conservative yes and you can see again if
[3:17:39.940 --> 3:17:43.580]  they if these Tea Party if the Tea Party management had been honest you would
[3:17:43.580 --> 3:17:47.180]  have had pull my Democrats you could have had conservative Democrats who were
[3:17:47.180 --> 3:17:51.380]  anti-Obama you could have had this entire Ron Paul area of opinion of
[3:17:51.380 --> 3:17:55.540]  libertarians people like this you could have had some anti-war people why not
[3:17:55.540 --> 3:18:00.420]  but no automatically they've got to be war mongers and pro-federal reserve and
[3:18:00.420 --> 3:18:04.500]  essentially you know follow the Republican congressional leadership so a
[3:18:04.500 --> 3:18:07.860]  lot of the people who go to the Tea Party tell themselves that this is not
[3:18:07.860 --> 3:18:11.540]  controlled by the Republican Party but in reality it seems to be pretty much
[3:18:11.540 --> 3:18:16.100]  controlled well let's go in closing in closing I want you to have a great
[3:18:16.100 --> 3:18:21.180]  2010 do you not agree with me though I want to see if you do I have no idea if
[3:18:21.180 --> 3:18:25.740]  the worm is turning the pendulum is beginning to stop and go back in our
[3:18:25.740 --> 3:18:30.940]  direction towards liberty freedom it's always darkest before the dawn but I
[3:18:30.940 --> 3:18:35.220]  really do see that there is a mass awakening and even if they try to hijack
[3:18:35.220 --> 3:18:43.220]  the resistance that that works for a shorter and shorter periods now and that
[3:18:43.220 --> 3:18:49.060]  the jig really is up and that we are on the edge of a massive change and that all
[3:18:49.060 --> 3:18:54.460]  of us being involved now can really have a chance in shaping the future destiny
[3:18:54.460 --> 3:18:58.820]  of humanity yes I would agree with that I mean certainly if you look just at this
[3:18:58.820 --> 3:19:03.420]  narrow question of false flag terrorism this is wearing very thin in other words
[3:19:03.420 --> 3:19:09.260]  I think for a lot of people the idea that the the famous now of umar
[3:19:09.260 --> 3:19:15.700]  Baruch Faruk Mutalab that this character is somebody on a mission
[3:19:15.700 --> 3:19:19.820]  in other words he is a protected pati and we've got scores of mainstream news
[3:19:19.820 --> 3:19:23.740]  articles now say why is the government not for a lot of people here's the thing
[3:19:23.740 --> 3:19:28.420]  that what what you see again with you know the Obama campaign in one way and
[3:19:28.420 --> 3:19:32.060]  now that they take over of the of the tea parties by the Republicans if you
[3:19:32.060 --> 3:19:37.100]  don't have some independent form of organization you will fall prey and you
[3:19:37.100 --> 3:19:44.460]  will be used by the other gang how about the Republicans in 2012 a Petraeus
[3:19:44.460 --> 3:19:49.740]  general Petraeus Mitt Romney ticket I think if we don't do something
[3:19:49.740 --> 3:19:55.020]  organizationally we're going to be faced with generally Webster great job we
[3:19:55.020 --> 3:19:58.620]  will see you next year my friend well you know what come back and talk about
[3:19:58.620 --> 3:20:04.700]  Petraeus that's happy new year to all this is an emergency alert people don't

[3:22:01.860 --> 3:22:06.900]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is
[3:22:06.900 --> 3:22:12.340]  our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we
[3:22:12.340 --> 3:22:15.660]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have turned a
[3:22:15.660 --> 3:22:20.300]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[3:22:20.300 --> 3:22:25.580]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[3:22:25.580 --> 3:22:30.100]  attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[3:22:30.100 --> 3:22:34.820]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[3:22:34.820 --> 3:22:38.460]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists
[3:22:38.460 --> 3:22:41.980]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[3:22:41.980 --> 3:22:46.540]  check out to. Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC
[3:22:46.540 --> 3:22:52.180]  we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on

[3:24:34.780 --> 3:24:38.940]  Jesse Ventura's new TV show the most incredible episode I've ever seen I'm
[3:24:38.940 --> 3:24:44.540]  still trying to digest it most incredible episode that's coming up
[3:24:44.540 --> 3:24:48.900]  world population reduction of Alfuzzi and Eugenics mindset of the world's
[3:24:48.900 --> 3:24:54.140]  ruling elite partly as a historian can back that up as well got some clips of
[3:24:54.140 --> 3:24:57.940]  that coming up I said I would do the decade of tyranny and review we're
[3:24:57.940 --> 3:25:03.180]  going to do that but Webster dropped this bombshell about how in the off-year
[3:25:03.180 --> 3:25:07.100]  elections next year and then two years out from that three years yeah you're
[3:25:07.100 --> 3:25:13.620]  gonna get exactly up a general betray us not betray us total globalist neocon
[3:25:13.620 --> 3:25:19.660]  built up as this fake hero along with a Mitt Romney and remember they represent
[3:25:19.660 --> 3:25:24.740]  the people that stage the big 9-11 attacks they're gonna come in and there
[3:25:24.740 --> 3:25:28.980]  will be such conservative mainline rebellion against Obama and his
[3:25:28.980 --> 3:25:33.140]  communist colorations which are just foundation fronts you know Hillary's
[3:25:33.140 --> 3:25:40.740]  as communist is as as as as I mean it's a complete joke and all of this is
[3:25:40.740 --> 3:25:46.660]  going on and yes you think Obama's bad it's gonna accelerate under the next
[3:25:46.660 --> 3:25:49.300]  right-wing person who's not gonna be right-wing at all they're gonna be a
[3:25:49.300 --> 3:25:54.780]  globalist Webster finish up with that well again that the challenge is that
[3:25:54.780 --> 3:25:58.700]  if we don't want to be used by somebody you've got to have some form of
[3:25:58.700 --> 3:26:03.220]  independent organization and some form of the economic program now my all the
[3:26:03.220 --> 3:26:06.860]  leftists are run by the foundations all the right-wingers are run by the big
[3:26:06.860 --> 3:26:11.140]  foundations we have to have you know the killer and corrupt this right the two
[3:26:11.140 --> 3:26:12.420]  things you want to avoid
[3:26:12.420 --> 3:26:17.140]  monetarism in other words this you know Milton Friedman economics on the one
[3:26:17.140 --> 3:26:21.940]  side and and now who's Ian is among the other the green extremely
[3:26:21.940 --> 3:26:26.780]  ecological global warming but now it's it's it's likely that the the Democrats
[3:26:26.780 --> 3:26:31.060]  will lose at least one House of Congress maybe both in 2010 and that
[3:26:31.060 --> 3:26:35.660]  comes in they stage a nuke attack military dictatorship set up we know
[3:26:35.660 --> 3:26:39.900]  the Pentagon's been selling that forever right so the the idea is that divided
[3:26:39.900 --> 3:26:43.380]  government would be a blessing in a way that's the one remedy in this system we
[3:26:43.380 --> 3:26:46.740]  need gridlock we need divided government let them fight each other to a stand
[3:26:46.740 --> 3:26:51.940]  still but then for 2012 the Republicans I don't I don't think any of these
[3:26:51.940 --> 3:26:56.180]  existing Republicans could be taken seriously so therefore I think general
[3:26:56.180 --> 3:27:00.380]  Petraeus coming in as a war hero now we've seen that before right from George
[3:27:00.380 --> 3:27:05.460]  Washington to to General Eisenhower in retrospect General Eisenhower was a
[3:27:05.460 --> 3:27:09.580]  tremendously good president look what he did the interstate highway system and the
[3:27:09.580 --> 3:27:12.500]  national aeronautics and space administration think of those those are
[3:27:12.500 --> 3:27:18.060]  tremendous achievements with Petraeus this would be well Bonapartism in other
[3:27:18.060 --> 3:27:23.300]  words government by military he would Hitler he well no not hitler but
[3:27:23.300 --> 3:27:26.820]  Hitler was a military wait wait wait wait not quite not quite you're not
[3:27:26.820 --> 3:27:31.860]  there yet because there's no mass movement yet it would be growing the
[3:27:31.860 --> 3:27:36.220]  difference would be fun hindenburg fun hindenburg is the hero of World War one
[3:27:36.220 --> 3:27:41.420]  more or less and he becomes the president of the the Weimar Republic and it's
[3:27:41.420 --> 3:27:47.300]  under his leadership that you get this extreme austerity you get in the case
[3:27:47.300 --> 3:27:52.420]  of fun hindenburg the burning government right of 1930 to 1932 where they take
[3:27:52.420 --> 3:27:56.260]  away your unemployment insurance just at the moment when you have the highest
[3:27:56.260 --> 3:28:00.580]  unemployment that there's ever been so fun hindenburg I think would be this
[3:28:00.580 --> 3:28:05.580]  would be what what Petraeus would do and then the dimension beyond that gets us
[3:28:05.580 --> 3:28:09.780]  to something more like an actual Nazi movement right with the with all the
[3:28:09.780 --> 3:28:14.940]  overtones that would probably have here in terms of white supremacy and and all
[3:28:14.940 --> 3:28:20.100]  sorts of other stuff like violence in the streets right the assault sections
[3:28:20.100 --> 3:28:25.540]  storm up Tylones well now I mean it's just like Petraeus would be able to
[3:28:25.540 --> 3:28:28.900]  attack conservatives and libertarians and they would say oh I'm turning my guns
[3:28:28.900 --> 3:28:33.460]  in it's to the general he's conservative mmm and it's just like with left cover
[3:28:33.460 --> 3:28:38.260]  Obama could start new wars cut people's health care and be praised as a loving
[3:28:38.260 --> 3:28:43.820]  commie I mean I would see under Petraeus them want I mean we know that Tommy
[3:28:43.820 --> 3:28:48.900]  Franks was on the payroll to go around and give speeches saying gee I don't like
[3:28:48.900 --> 3:28:53.540]  it but it's what we need one more big terror attack military dictatorship is
[3:28:53.540 --> 3:28:58.420]  what the people want so we know that's what they've been selling and yeah
[3:28:58.420 --> 3:29:03.060]  Petraeus is just an absolute weasel demon so I think that Petraeus and then
[3:29:03.060 --> 3:29:07.460]  of course Mitt Romney Mitt Romney the hedge fund hyena the asset stripper the
[3:29:07.460 --> 3:29:11.980]  the agent of Wall Street who would take take the economic side of it and this
[3:29:11.980 --> 3:29:15.980]  would be a government that would not really lean on the Republican Party
[3:29:15.980 --> 3:29:19.980]  which I think is is in the process of disintegrating it would be a government
[3:29:19.980 --> 3:29:25.260]  that would lean more explicitly on the army and military the police which is
[3:29:25.260 --> 3:29:28.860]  what the Rand Corporation and the big think tanks have already been setting up

[3:33:21.500 --> 3:33:24.820]  rant in the first hour that's coming up in the rebroadcast if you missed it
[3:33:24.820 --> 3:33:29.740]  where I laid out the cost and what we really face as a society alright I want
[3:33:29.740 --> 3:33:33.460]  to get a little bit more into Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory TV show
[3:33:33.460 --> 3:33:37.180]  because it continues to amaze me what they're letting on television and I
[3:33:37.180 --> 3:33:41.420]  still haven't gotten my mind around how this is on TV last night was so
[3:33:41.420 --> 3:33:45.180]  groundbreaking they've exposed the whole big brother system the global
[3:33:45.180 --> 3:33:49.900]  warming is a plan to shut down society and to rob the population for world
[3:33:49.900 --> 3:33:55.420]  government completely our side of the story which is the truth last night's
[3:33:55.420 --> 3:34:00.820]  how the elite are poisoning your food your water your vaccines again I
[3:34:00.820 --> 3:34:04.860]  recommended Esteline I recommended Dr. Montee also recommended laybohm
[3:34:04.860 --> 3:34:08.500]  surprised she came up to the US because she really did leave the US she really
[3:34:08.500 --> 3:34:11.660]  thought this year was gonna be the year I saw it more as a drill with the
[3:34:11.660 --> 3:34:15.780]  vaccines to get everybody ready to go under federal control and of course
[3:34:15.780 --> 3:34:19.220]  they're debilitating things in the vaccines that way people don't rise up
[3:34:19.220 --> 3:34:22.220]  and rebel because Jesse's like well if you do this everybody starts dropping
[3:34:22.220 --> 3:34:26.820]  dead they'll get mad not if it's soft kill not if it causes something to
[3:34:26.820 --> 3:34:33.220]  debilitating that takes time I thought it was a great program but what was
[3:34:33.220 --> 3:34:37.620]  perfect was the global warming but this is just so incredible to have this on
[3:34:37.620 --> 3:34:42.980]  air it it makes my head spin that's coming up I want to go over the decade
[3:34:42.980 --> 3:34:48.020]  of tyranny an article by Alex Jones Steve Watson and Paul Watson there's
[3:34:48.020 --> 3:34:52.740]  been a loss of basic freedoms has spurred a mass awakening next decade will
[3:34:52.740 --> 3:34:58.460]  be defined by the restoration of our liberties yeah more than that I think
[3:34:58.460 --> 3:35:02.380]  it's going to be defined by the great awakening and in the next decade will be
[3:35:02.380 --> 3:35:07.940]  the decision on the true future of humanity but during the first nine
[3:35:07.940 --> 3:35:12.340]  years of the new millennium we have been witness to a rapid erosion of freedom
[3:35:12.340 --> 3:35:16.620]  our basic liberties have a systematically deteriorating and diluted by a
[3:35:16.620 --> 3:35:20.900]  vast expansion of coordinated global tyranny the decade is on over yet there
[3:35:20.900 --> 3:35:26.100]  is still another year to go however given the mainstream media is obsessively
[3:35:26.100 --> 3:35:32.220]  compiling its own decades list we felt it necessary to draw up our own and
[3:35:32.220 --> 3:35:36.220]  highlight the major events that have shaped the world we now live in and the
[3:35:36.220 --> 3:35:40.020]  future we face yeah it's just been a decade of lies where they say the
[3:35:40.020 --> 3:35:43.580]  decades over when there's a whole other year coming up just like they started
[3:35:43.580 --> 3:35:47.820]  the century a year early the millennium a year early the decade a year early it's
[3:35:47.820 --> 3:35:53.020]  a joke it is important to stress the fact that while we have indeed experienced
[3:35:53.020 --> 3:35:57.420]  a decade of tyranny we have also seen a mass awakening an expansion of knowledge
[3:35:57.420 --> 3:36:02.020]  an exponential increase in opposition to the agenda we have come to know as the
[3:36:02.020 --> 3:36:06.700]  new world order here is a chronological order following prison planet comms
[3:36:06.700 --> 3:36:10.060]  defining moments of the decade and of course there have been countless others
[3:36:10.060 --> 3:36:14.740]  Sunday and into next week we'll talk about what you think the biggest stories
[3:36:14.740 --> 3:36:19.020]  both overreported under reported were and what you think will happen in the
[3:36:19.020 --> 3:36:22.500]  next decade that's coming up next week
[3:36:23.060 --> 3:36:32.540]  2001 9-11 9-1-1 was a precursor for everything that followed during the
[3:36:32.540 --> 3:36:39.260]  decade of tyranny the immediate invasion of Afghanistan saw the US go to war
[3:36:39.260 --> 3:36:44.060]  without former declaration the passage of the USA Patriot Act overnight with
[3:36:44.060 --> 3:36:47.580]  members of Congress not even being afforded time to read it paved the
[3:36:47.580 --> 3:36:51.780]  way for a decade of freedom stripping government legislation that had nothing
[3:36:51.780 --> 3:36:56.420]  to do with even fighting the imaginary terror the expansion of the phony war on
[3:36:56.420 --> 3:37:01.060]  terror as justification for big government a domestic police state and a
[3:37:01.060 --> 3:37:06.060]  interventionist foreign policy also stemmed directly from 9-11 we've now
[3:37:06.060 --> 3:37:10.300]  discovered under homeland security the myack reports and others that say this
[3:37:10.300 --> 3:37:13.780]  real system was set up for the American people they know they're criminal they
[3:37:13.780 --> 3:37:18.540]  know they're a bunch of crooks taking over over the past decade we have
[3:37:18.540 --> 3:37:23.420]  ceaselessly exposed the lies behind 9-11 we have seen the 9-11 truth movement
[3:37:23.420 --> 3:37:28.420]  blossom from efforts by a select few individuals myself who kicked it all off
[3:37:28.420 --> 3:37:35.140]  to encompass the work of thousands if not millions all there is no doubt 9-11
[3:37:35.140 --> 3:37:39.460]  is the decade of tyranny's defining moment exposing the truth behind it has
[3:37:39.460 --> 3:37:45.300]  also led to an equally influential awakening that is still ongoing I would
[3:37:45.300 --> 3:37:50.980]  say accelerating 2002 the creation of the Department of Homeland Security the
[3:37:50.980 --> 3:37:54.940]  fallout of 9-11 led to the realignment of power in the US with the shadow
[3:37:54.940 --> 3:37:58.380]  government stepping out of the open and implementing elements of a long-term
[3:37:58.380 --> 3:38:02.300]  agenda to subvert constitutional freedom and bring the states under total
[3:38:02.300 --> 3:38:06.620]  federal control after the passage the Patriot Act in late 2001 the next major
[3:38:06.620 --> 3:38:09.540]  step towards tyranny came with expansion of federal government through the
[3:38:09.540 --> 3:38:14.500]  creation of DHS the DHS has played the role of the domestic police state
[3:38:14.500 --> 3:38:18.900]  enforcer agency encompassing every major law enforcement agency in the nation
[3:38:18.900 --> 3:38:24.740]  and 30 plus other federal agencies under one single office now being handed
[3:38:24.740 --> 3:38:30.260]  over to international Interpol control and under the Israelis as well with
[3:38:30.260 --> 3:38:35.140]  multiple subsequent reports and video productions fingering the American
[3:38:35.140 --> 3:38:39.100]  people as potential terrorists the Orwellian titled agency has proven to
[3:38:39.100 --> 3:38:43.980]  be and proven to have nothing to do with security and everything to do with
[3:38:43.980 --> 3:38:48.300]  limiting the freedoms of the people all over the country and securing the
[3:38:48.300 --> 3:38:54.380]  banking takeover that was to come 2003 invasion of Iraq the move to start the
[3:38:54.380 --> 3:38:59.700]  dominoes for World War three in March of 2003 the invasion of Iraq was a war
[3:38:59.700 --> 3:39:05.420]  based on a mountain of lies and deceit and yet at the time the public swallowed
[3:39:05.420 --> 3:39:10.980]  the propaganda with ones and bloodlust the constant invocation of the link
[3:39:10.980 --> 3:39:15.500]  between 9 11 and Saddam Hussein was repeatedly debunked before the war even
[3:39:15.500 --> 3:39:19.780]  began and after the invasion but of course the war was set the invasion was
[3:39:19.780 --> 3:39:23.820]  an illegal attack based on a wholly contrived pretext and the war was not
[3:39:23.820 --> 3:39:29.060]  approved by Congress this set of precedent for unconstitutional global
[3:39:29.060 --> 3:39:34.180]  preemptive strikes in the name of the war on terror conservative estimates put
[3:39:34.180 --> 3:39:40.140]  the death toll and the result of the invasion around 655,000 but this number
[3:39:40.140 --> 3:39:45.340]  is far higher when the previous year's sanctions are taken to account upon US
[3:39:45.340 --> 3:39:49.940]  occupation of the country Iraq was turned into one giant gulag with hundreds
[3:39:49.940 --> 3:39:53.580]  of thousands detained and held in internment camps for the most menial
[3:39:53.580 --> 3:39:58.100]  offenses the real numbers about a million and a half dead the occupation of
[3:39:58.100 --> 3:40:02.100]  Iraq provided the opportunity to build hundreds of military bases to be used to
[3:40:02.100 --> 3:40:06.980]  launch pad for future preemptive wars in the key geopolitical region of the
[3:40:06.980 --> 3:40:14.340]  Middle East the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal of course also came out the
[3:40:14.340 --> 3:40:17.420]  army's own report admitting children were raped in front of their parents at
[3:40:17.420 --> 3:40:21.860]  other camps people were tortured to death for fake confessions it was also
[3:40:21.860 --> 3:40:25.940]  meant to test us forces and find people who liked torture who could be moved
[3:40:25.940 --> 3:40:32.060]  then to be commanders of black sites all over the world and now rendition has
[3:40:32.060 --> 3:40:35.940]  been expanded under Obama I would add of course all the famous things that
[3:40:35.940 --> 3:40:40.820]  happened there hurricane Katrina fallout where FEMA ordered a stand down and that
[3:40:40.820 --> 3:40:44.620]  no aid be delivered so that FEMA could then claim that they'd screwed up and
[3:40:44.620 --> 3:40:49.780]  he did even more unlimited power and control and funding and so that's really
[3:40:49.780 --> 3:40:58.740]  what went on there with Katrina we had the liquid bomb scams of 2006 which led
[3:40:58.740 --> 3:41:02.100]  to tighter restrictions on airlines now we've had the underwear bomber to be
[3:41:02.100 --> 3:41:06.180]  used as the same now the TSA announces they're going on the streets the buses
[3:41:06.180 --> 3:41:10.180]  the trains of America federalizing your police training you that you have less
[3:41:10.180 --> 3:41:15.220]  rights than someone installing us Russia 2007 the rise of the Ron Paul
[3:41:15.220 --> 3:41:18.820]  Revolution the rise of the resistance people begin to learn the Federal
[3:41:18.820 --> 3:41:24.740]  Reserve is the real government and it's truly running the society 2008 the
[3:41:24.740 --> 3:41:30.300]  bankers carry out the banking heist the central banks that own the US government
[3:41:30.300 --> 3:41:34.180]  set the course for the most egregious looting of American public in history
[3:41:34.180 --> 3:41:38.260]  with the passage of the Tartt bailout legislation of course we could have the
[3:41:38.260 --> 3:41:42.260]  animal ID premises ID act taking over the farms the ranches the threat
[3:41:42.260 --> 3:41:47.300]  integration centers being set up the bailout merely increased the severity
[3:41:47.300 --> 3:41:50.380]  financial downturn allowed the same elite to exploit the crisis in the
[3:41:50.380 --> 3:41:53.860]  pretext of centralizing control of the world economic system and creating a
[3:41:53.860 --> 3:41:58.220]  new world order and the single global currency into the sdr's Henry Paulson
[3:41:58.220 --> 3:42:01.260]  with the chief architect of the bailout and the man who committed the financial
[3:42:01.260 --> 3:42:05.620]  terrorism by threatening Congress with martial law and food riots give folks
[3:42:05.620 --> 3:42:10.060]  a close shot of this if they didn't pass the initial Tartt package bracingly
[3:42:10.060 --> 3:42:15.660]  pocketed 200 million in Goldman Sachs profits tax-free for himself while
[3:42:15.660 --> 3:42:20.700]  handing out billions and ill-gotten gains to Bankster buddies as after he
[3:42:20.700 --> 3:42:25.260]  pulled abate and switched by changing the entire focus of the bailout from
[3:42:25.260 --> 3:42:29.820]  buying up toxic debt to giving money directly to financial institutions over
[3:42:29.820 --> 3:42:34.980]  24 trillion Watson has a low number is 23.7 trillion and then another 5 trillion
[3:42:34.980 --> 3:42:42.780]  and or 4.5 trillion acceleration of world government in 2009 2009
[3:42:42.780 --> 3:42:46.140]  represents the year that the agenda for world government was both openly
[3:42:46.140 --> 3:42:50.900]  announced and the acceleration of its implementation of reached breakneck
[3:42:50.900 --> 3:42:55.620]  speed as globalists exploited both the engineered financial crisis and the
[3:42:55.620 --> 3:43:00.540]  contrived global warning scam to move to finalize total dictatorial control over
[3:43:00.540 --> 3:43:06.020]  the planet in October New York Times editorial we can do it
[3:43:06.020 --> 3:43:11.020]  ban chi moon wrote that the efforts to impose restrictions on co2 emissions
[3:43:11.020 --> 3:43:16.300]  must include an equitable global governance structure the new EU president
[3:43:16.300 --> 3:43:20.620]  Herman von Roompi said in December press conference that the Copenhagen
[3:43:20.620 --> 3:43:23.420]  conference was the first step towards global government management of our
[3:43:23.420 --> 3:43:28.940]  planet similarly Al Gore in a speech earlier this year so that attempts to
[3:43:28.940 --> 3:43:32.460]  regulate co2 emissions would be driven through global governance and global
[3:43:32.460 --> 3:43:35.780]  agreements although it failed to ram through a large portion of the global
[3:43:35.780 --> 3:43:38.940]  government agenda the Copenhagen agreement laid out the foundation for the
[3:43:38.940 --> 3:43:43.220]  introduction of a global transaction tax to be paid to private banks but again it
[3:43:43.220 --> 3:43:48.460]  was a huge victory the equivalent of Washington at Trenton when we defeated
[3:43:48.460 --> 3:43:54.060]  the main conference and when those emails got leaked so major victory showing
[3:43:54.060 --> 3:43:59.180]  people we can have victories ahead we see the decade of freedom the battle
[3:43:59.180 --> 3:44:03.740]  between tyranny and freedom is a long-term game of brinkmanship however
[3:44:03.740 --> 3:44:08.020]  as we move into 2010 we are reaching a critical time in modern history
[3:44:08.020 --> 3:44:16.140]  humanity must decide whether to engage in battle for freedom or accept the
[3:44:16.140 --> 3:44:22.700]  future under the rule of tyranny that's got a bibliography at the bottom of all
[3:44:22.700 --> 3:44:26.980]  the documentation I kind of hurried through that I'm not a very good news
[3:44:26.980 --> 3:44:32.980]  reader three and a half hours into the show I get a bit tired but we'll have
[3:44:32.980 --> 3:44:38.980]  your decade of tyranny and review but also your decade of awakening next week
[3:44:38.980 --> 3:44:46.820]  a lot of open phones and some other very informative guest I'm gonna try to review
[3:44:46.820 --> 3:44:50.420]  last night's show with Ventura I noticed when I took calls almost every call
[3:44:50.420 --> 3:44:56.740]  brought up the TV show and callers brought up how almost every call on
[3:44:56.740 --> 3:45:00.820]  c-spans talking about the New World Order stage terror left-right paradigm
[3:45:00.820 --> 3:45:07.580]  awakening I mean it's it's the globalists are gonna strike back though I
[3:45:07.580 --> 3:45:11.020]  really do think they're gonna nuke cities they're gonna do I mean you thought
[3:45:11.020 --> 3:45:14.860]  9-11 was big this underwear bomber stuff is just a test
[3:45:14.860 --> 3:45:18.780]  folks we better expose these terrorists we better expose these foreign bankers
[3:45:18.780 --> 3:45:23.460]  or it's just and all of you fools serving the system you better grow up I
[3:45:23.460 --> 3:45:28.620]  mean this is I mean we've got Hillary Clinton's own treatise where she
[3:45:28.620 --> 3:45:32.660]  admits she loves communism and covertly taken over the government the bankers
[3:45:32.660 --> 3:45:36.860]  fund the communist they tell you when they rob you at gunpoint and put you in
[3:45:36.860 --> 3:45:40.980]  a labor camp that it's for the people it's slavery it has nothing to do with
[3:45:40.980 --> 3:45:45.820]  that you foolish leftists and all you right-wingers that think war and tyranny
[3:45:45.820 --> 3:45:51.620]  and checkpoints are conservative wake up morons you're controlled by the left
[3:45:51.620 --> 3:45:55.700]  right paradigm and if you don't wake up now and say no to all of this
[3:45:55.700 --> 3:46:01.980]  corporatism crony capitalism monopoly capitalism the police state big
[3:46:01.980 --> 3:46:06.140]  government corporate welfare all of it and if you leftist don't figure out that
[3:46:06.140 --> 3:46:12.300]  any big government program is gonna be a rip-off don't you understand that of
[3:46:12.300 --> 3:46:16.140]  course the banker bailout was a rip-off of course the health care plan they
[3:46:16.140 --> 3:46:21.140]  haven't passed yet as a rip-off of course the left is freaking out now you
[3:46:21.140 --> 3:46:24.580]  thought you were gonna get to rob some rich people the rich people wrote the
[3:46:24.580 --> 3:46:27.900]  stinking thing they run the government they're gonna be taking more out of your
[3:46:27.900 --> 3:46:36.500]  blue collar paycheck you fool how was this being allowed to air because
[3:46:36.500 --> 3:46:40.180]  everybody's waking up with a new world order they put in an entertainment format
[3:46:40.180 --> 3:46:44.100]  and the establishment just thinks it'll further condition people that's even what
[3:46:44.100 --> 3:46:48.380]  Ventura thinks but it's waking people up you have an open discussion of world
[3:46:48.380 --> 3:46:53.100]  government an open discussion of how they plan to exterminate you I can't
[3:46:53.100 --> 3:46:58.900]  believe this aired last night again I recommended my teeth all the major
[3:46:58.900 --> 3:47:04.020]  people interviewed here I knew they were they were preparing for martial law
[3:47:04.020 --> 3:47:08.140]  earlier in the year but we always stop them from fully implementing so they
[3:47:08.140 --> 3:47:12.900]  they got their vaccine millions made they're fear mongering through we knew
[3:47:12.900 --> 3:47:16.220]  they were getting ready for flu hype in January I went on air and said look for
[3:47:16.220 --> 3:47:19.540]  something big with the flu I don't know if it's gonna be as big as the feds are
[3:47:19.540 --> 3:47:23.260]  teaching local counties they're saying millions dead per state that's probably
[3:47:23.260 --> 3:47:30.340]  bull but what is in the vaccine we've proven does debilitate people as part of
[3:47:30.340 --> 3:47:35.820]  a soft kill program and does debilitate you over time that's the only part I
[3:47:35.820 --> 3:47:38.860]  disagree with is with dr. Labo she says oh yes it'll kill a bunch of people in
[3:47:38.860 --> 3:47:43.540]  the open they'll be a rebellion and I told her on air months ago I said no you
[3:47:43.540 --> 3:47:48.340]  watch it's it's gonna be debilitating over a long period of time sure some will
[3:47:48.340 --> 3:47:51.900]  die and some have and some will get sick so that's the only part of the show I
[3:47:51.900 --> 3:47:57.540]  don't like but overall she did a great job in it as well but I think as to one
[3:47:57.540 --> 3:48:01.140]  that I recommended dr. Montee recommended I was one of them I was the
[3:48:01.140 --> 3:48:05.660]  main consultant on this show it's just a great program and I'm really honored to
[3:48:05.660 --> 3:48:09.860]  be involved with it let's go to one of the clips now go ahead and roll this
[3:48:09.860 --> 3:48:27.420]  clip Alex Jones is a leading conspiracy expert and Builderberg foe and he's
[3:48:27.420 --> 3:48:37.860]  definitely made his presence known at the Builderberg meetings Jones as a
[3:48:37.860 --> 3:48:48.460]  terrifying twist to the investigation Alex why we meet in here because the
[3:48:48.460 --> 3:48:52.860]  information I want to talk to you about is important and I wanted to talk to you
[3:48:52.860 --> 3:48:56.980]  privately well this is certainly private what do you got for me the big
[3:48:56.980 --> 3:49:04.500]  cahuna which is it's the science of controlling populations and controlling
[3:49:04.500 --> 3:49:09.020]  information and becoming the map makers of the mind they lay out through the
[3:49:09.020 --> 3:49:12.860]  culture through their different media arms the system and the direction they
[3:49:12.860 --> 3:49:16.140]  want to go so basically the Builderberg group meeting is like a massive
[3:49:16.140 --> 3:49:19.540]  mafia commission meeting they're already running a different enterprises they're
[3:49:19.540 --> 3:49:24.460]  now meeting once a year to make major decisions or to tweak or change their
[3:49:24.460 --> 3:49:28.900]  overall program so it's basically like the godfather yes the big scene in the
[3:49:28.900 --> 3:49:32.980]  godfather were with all the leaders of the families were brought together there
[3:49:32.980 --> 3:49:36.180]  was a problem and they solved it that day if we go to the movies that's
[3:49:36.180 --> 3:49:41.460]  exactly they operate my covert means and the policy is a planetary government to
[3:49:41.460 --> 3:49:45.980]  carry out the extermination the murder of at least 80% of the world's
[3:49:45.980 --> 3:49:56.020]  population and they're on record saying they're doing they're so arrogant they
[3:49:56.020 --> 3:49:59.940]  think the public's too stupid to find out what they're doing they want you dead
[3:49:59.940 --> 3:50:06.540]  governor why it is the elite trying to get a hedge on the future total control
[3:50:06.540 --> 3:50:11.060]  freaks wanting to control mankind's destiny and only let their blood and
[3:50:11.060 --> 3:50:14.820]  their elite families go forward into the future with the life extension
[3:50:14.820 --> 3:50:19.700]  technologies jones is only the latest authority to say the elitists want to
[3:50:19.700 --> 3:50:24.980]  get the population down to a so-called manageable level he's the first to give
[3:50:24.980 --> 3:50:29.660]  a hint of how they might do it that's the debate happening right now well we
[3:50:29.660 --> 3:50:33.820]  sit here talking are they gonna go with soft kill in the water or do they go
[3:50:33.820 --> 3:50:38.820]  ahead and go with the hardcore mega death mega kill and kill four and a half
[3:50:38.820 --> 3:50:44.500]  billion people at least this is way more urgent than I even thought I talked to
[3:50:44.500 --> 3:50:49.700]  Alex Jones and he told me one of the main objectives of the Bilderbergs get
[3:50:49.700 --> 3:50:57.580]  this depopulation of the world cutting down the masses and how does he say
[3:50:57.580 --> 3:51:02.740]  they're gonna do it all right information we'll be right back
[3:51:02.740 --> 3:51:07.980]  remain in your houses the president of the United States has declared martial
[3:51:07.980 --> 3:51:13.780]  law under executive order 11,004 will they do it will they pull the trigger
[3:51:13.780 --> 3:51:19.300]  this time we all pray they stand down but an engineered crisis seems more
[3:51:19.300 --> 3:51:25.900]  likely with each passing day think it can't happen here executive order 10 990
[3:51:25.900 --> 3:51:32.020]  locks down all highways executive order 10 995 ceases control of all media
[3:51:32.020 --> 3:51:38.340]  outlets executive order 10 998 controls all farms and food supplies all these
[3:51:38.340 --> 3:51:43.980]  executive orders are now cocked loaded and waiting for the right crisis so if
[3:51:43.980 --> 3:51:47.540]  you're worried about the possibility of martial law here in America or have
[3:51:47.540 --> 3:51:52.300]  questions about how to survive it go to martial law survival comm that's
[3:51:52.300 --> 3:51:58.060]  martial law survival comm go to martial law survival comm right now you must

[3:52:13.260 --> 3:52:17.740]  rug from underneath the Americans at home tremendous influence on our
[3:52:17.740 --> 3:52:21.980]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[3:52:21.980 --> 3:52:27.180]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[3:52:27.180 --> 3:52:31.780]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[3:52:31.780 --> 3:52:36.140]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[3:52:36.140 --> 3:52:39.900]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[3:52:39.900 --> 3:52:43.860]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[3:52:43.860 --> 3:52:49.380]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of

[3:54:43.060 --> 3:54:48.380]  the mainstream and the system is in trouble and everyone worldwide is sick
[3:54:48.380 --> 3:54:53.980]  of the offshore corporations robbing everyone and so they're setting up a
[3:54:53.980 --> 3:54:58.820]  UN with a world government a world army to make everyone do what they want so
[3:54:58.820 --> 3:55:04.700]  they can carry out illegitimate crimes against us and sterilize us and people
[3:55:04.700 --> 3:55:08.620]  aren't putting up with it that's why suddenly there's magazines and articles
[3:55:08.620 --> 3:55:13.260]  everywhere I go oh everyone's getting sterilized we don't know why it's so
[3:55:13.260 --> 3:55:18.540]  wonderful oh the fertility is falling it's so good oh one-shot policies even

[3:55:37.980 --> 3:55:41.820]  Monty talking to him on the Ventura show here here's a clip it's all up on

[3:55:46.260 --> 3:55:53.980]  now one of those sources has summoned the governor Alex Jones says he knows
[3:55:53.980 --> 3:55:57.620]  how they plan to depopulate
[3:56:01.180 --> 3:56:06.820]  Alex you sounded urgent there's an entire agenda afoot to force the
[3:56:06.820 --> 3:56:12.700]  population to undergo different type of medical treatments namely vaccines we're
[3:56:12.700 --> 3:56:16.420]  seeing a medical tyranny being set up not just in the United States but
[3:56:16.420 --> 3:56:21.060]  worldwide under the UN and the World Health Organization who's behind all
[3:56:21.060 --> 3:56:25.300]  this the Bilderberg group they want a planetary dictatorship so they can
[3:56:25.300 --> 3:56:28.780]  carry out their forced depopulation agenda and they want to do it through the
[3:56:28.780 --> 3:56:33.300]  medical system and that's why vaccines are so important we know that many of
[3:56:33.300 --> 3:56:37.100]  these vaccines turn out to have serious adverse reactions that this is being
[3:56:37.100 --> 3:56:42.020]  done by design they kill you slowly over time that's why they're called soft
[3:56:42.020 --> 3:56:46.460]  kill and I've got an insider I think you should really talk to Dr. Rima Labo
[3:56:46.460 --> 3:56:52.220]  okay so that's a little forte there's a lot of these clips here's another random

[3:57:14.040 --> 3:57:20.860]  this stuff let me tell you a story in 2003 I had a patient in my drug-free
[3:57:20.860 --> 3:57:28.180]  medical practice who was ahead of state and one day she said you know it's
[3:57:28.180 --> 3:57:34.420]  almost time for the great culling to begin what that's what I said the what
