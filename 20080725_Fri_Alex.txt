[00:00.000 --> 00:10.520]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.520 --> 00:11.520]  You want answers?
[00:11.520 --> 00:13.680]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.680 --> 00:31.400]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:31.400 --> 00:36.720]  Homeland Security visited Genesis two days ago, Ted was at a business meeting, the owner
[00:36.720 --> 00:43.080]  of the network, he finally was able to meet with Homeland Security yesterday and we will
[00:43.080 --> 00:48.920]  tell you what is going on after the first break that is coming up.
[00:48.920 --> 00:54.040]  Make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, we're big, we're having an effect, and the enemies
[00:54.040 --> 01:02.160]  of the Republic, the security apparatus that the globalists have set up is there to protect
[01:02.160 --> 01:07.360]  the terrorists that carried out the terror attacks and is there to bring in a hardcore
[01:07.360 --> 01:10.440]  police state here in the United States.
[01:10.440 --> 01:14.840]  We have this from top, former CIA analyst, former head of the Treasury Department, we
[01:14.840 --> 01:20.480]  have this from White House historians, we have this from sociologists, we have this
[01:20.480 --> 01:27.440]  from political scientists, from very diverse backgrounds, come on this radio show and tell
[01:27.440 --> 01:33.360]  you the same thing over and over again, and it has nothing to do with George Bush or Barack
[01:33.360 --> 01:39.440]  Obama, they are complete puppets carrying this out, they are following orders to a tee.
[01:39.440 --> 01:45.320]  Barack Obama has called for a new world order in Germany, Hitler, of course, second book
[01:45.320 --> 01:50.720]  was the new world order, a pamphlet, Hitler in almost every speech called for a new world
[01:50.720 --> 01:57.440]  order, so much so that we have got Disney anti-Nazi cartoons aired in newsreels during
[01:57.440 --> 02:03.400]  World War II where it makes fun of Hitler with Daffy Duck in Germany with the Nazis
[02:03.400 --> 02:06.880]  stomping around singing new world order.
[02:06.880 --> 02:13.800]  I mean, it's just unbelievable, Barack Obama goes to Germany, calls for a new world order
[02:13.800 --> 02:19.160]  and with a vicious look in his eye says that all Americans, all people in the world must
[02:19.160 --> 02:26.760]  serve the new world order, this is just unbelievably evil, there is no doubt this was a written
[02:26.760 --> 02:31.960]  speech by design to let the world know he is for one world government and that don't
[02:31.960 --> 02:38.360]  worry elite, I'm new world order, I'm Bilderberg, I'm going to continue the agenda and I'm going
[02:38.360 --> 02:45.480]  to fool all these schmucks and chumps and idiots that are watching me, these fools,
[02:45.480 --> 02:51.240]  you know, have no idea, I have fooled the black people, I have fooled the white liberals,
[02:51.240 --> 02:56.680]  they think because I'm half black that I'm somehow going to save people as if the new
[02:56.680 --> 03:01.240]  world order a million times hasn't hired blacks to carry out all sorts of horrible operations
[03:01.240 --> 03:07.040]  in Africa and in the United States as if it matters what color he is, now we are truly
[03:07.040 --> 03:12.280]  color blind here and it shows how the quote left and many others are not, they are obsessed
[03:12.280 --> 03:19.440]  with color and because he's got some more melanin in his skin and is a light shade of
[03:19.440 --> 03:28.480]  chestnut brown, everything is just fine, well if having chestnut skin is good and is the
[03:28.480 --> 03:33.400]  only prerequisite you need, I can, you know, find you any number of rednecks who work out
[03:33.400 --> 03:38.400]  in the oil fields who've got darker skin than Barack Obama, it doesn't mean that they
[03:38.400 --> 03:43.360]  should be president, in fact I can go out and bake in the sun for a month and get darker
[03:43.360 --> 03:51.960]  than Barack Obama, it means nothing, the melanin in his skin, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing,
[03:51.960 --> 03:57.920]  the guy is total new world order and is definitely their man with this speech, we are in a lot
[03:57.920 --> 04:03.160]  of trouble and I'm not saying vote for McCain, they give you false choices, you know, it's
[04:03.160 --> 04:08.880]  like you want to be shot in a firing squad by 30 odd six or 308, it doesn't matter when
[04:08.880 --> 04:15.520]  20 bullets are going to be flying into your skin whether it's 308 or 30 odd six and you
[04:15.520 --> 04:19.480]  can debate which one of them is the 308 and which one is the 30 odd six, the 30 odd six
[04:19.480 --> 04:24.080]  I guess is a little more power, a little more punch to it, you know, I guess one of them
[04:24.080 --> 04:30.640]  is going out the muzzle at what, 1300 feet per second, the other is going out at 1400
[04:30.640 --> 04:35.120]  feet per second depending on the load, makes no difference, no difference, it's still a
[04:35.120 --> 04:40.800]  high powered rifle round, folks the news I've got is all off the charts, US foreclosures
[04:40.800 --> 04:47.680]  double as house prices decline, GM and Ford on the verge of bankruptcy, Navy prosecutor
[04:47.680 --> 04:53.720]  in Gitmo case, fourth plane shot down, government required distance education spy cameras on
[04:53.720 --> 04:59.800]  Americans, soy foods reduced sperm count numbers, it just goes on and on, ultramassive radio
[04:59.800 --> 05:00.800]  broadcast.
[05:00.800 --> 05:06.080]  Now, from the makers of Loose Change, the most downloaded film in internet history comes
[05:06.080 --> 05:12.280]  the long awaited release of Loose Change Final Cut, an entirely new two hour film that completely
[05:12.280 --> 05:17.040]  destroys the official fable forever, Loose Change Final Cut hopes to be a catalyst for

[05:21.760 --> 05:26.240]  and the true perpetrators of the horrendous crime are brought to justice, Loose Change
[05:26.240 --> 05:31.720]  Final Cut is the ultimate 9-11 expose, from hijackers being trained at US military bases

[06:00.920 --> 06:05.440]  Hi, this is Alex Jones and I want to talk to you about the high price of gasoline.
[06:05.440 --> 06:09.400]  It's no secret that gasoline quality is poor even though we're paying record prices at
[06:09.400 --> 06:10.400]  the pump.
[06:10.400 --> 06:14.440]  I have run across a company called SFR who has developed two products that improve gas
[06:14.440 --> 06:15.440]  mileage.
[06:15.440 --> 06:19.760]  Instead of paying a mechanic as much as $300 to clean your injection system, protect a
[06:19.760 --> 06:25.400]  complete fuel system treatment, cleans to 95% of new engine condition, improving mileage
[06:25.400 --> 06:26.960]  and only one tank full.
[06:26.960 --> 06:30.720]  Protect an engine treatment not only reduces friction, but it extends the life of your
[06:30.720 --> 06:31.720]  engine.
[06:31.720 --> 06:35.440]  Let's face it, with the high price of gasoline it's time to take action.
[06:35.440 --> 06:40.560]  Purchase a protective fuel system treatment for only $9.95 and receive a free engine treatment
[06:40.560 --> 06:43.280]  which is a $12.95 value free.
[06:43.280 --> 06:45.560]  Call 8888 use SFR1.
[06:45.560 --> 06:52.800]  That number again is 8888 use SFR1 or check them out online at OilCompanySecret.com.
[06:52.800 --> 06:55.440]  That's OilCompanySecret.com.
[06:55.440 --> 06:59.280]  Satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back and it's safe for all cars.
[06:59.280 --> 07:00.280]  Act now.
[07:00.280 --> 07:04.640]  Hey everybody, if you're anything like me, I'll bet you like to eat.
[07:04.640 --> 07:11.640]  I like egg scrambles for breakfast, fresh homemade bread, delicious pastas like lasagna,
[07:11.640 --> 07:14.880]  I love beef stroganoff, I love chicken noodle soup.
[07:14.880 --> 07:20.000]  I love desserts, all kinds of entrees and soups and desserts and breakfast.
[07:20.000 --> 07:21.000]  I love that stuff.
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.560]  Now, food prices are skyrocketing just like gasoline prices.
[07:24.560 --> 07:28.720]  I mean, the gasoline prices have gone insanely high, probably going to go higher.
[07:28.720 --> 07:30.200]  Grocery prices are right on their heels.
[07:30.200 --> 07:32.320]  How are people going to be able to afford to eat?
[07:32.320 --> 07:37.320]  Well, I found a way to buy really incredible foods like I just described at half the price
[07:37.320 --> 07:39.080]  of last year's grocery bill.
[07:39.080 --> 07:42.920]  For less than half of what you spent for the same amount of food last year, I can have
[07:42.920 --> 07:44.920]  it delivered to your door.
[07:44.920 --> 07:45.920]  Let me tell you how.

[07:56.560 --> 08:05.760]  800-409-5633, cut those food costs now.
[08:05.760 --> 08:10.560]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[08:10.560 --> 08:11.560]  You want answers?
[08:11.560 --> 08:13.760]  Well, so does he.
[08:13.760 --> 08:34.200]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[08:34.200 --> 08:36.760]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:36.760 --> 08:44.040]  The House History Committee has been hearing a list of speakers worshiping George Bush,
[08:44.040 --> 08:50.280]  the deck stacked against Dennis Kasinich, and he has had his hands tied and has been
[08:50.280 --> 08:55.600]  told that he can't read any articles of impeachment or bring forward any of the charges, just
[08:55.600 --> 09:02.840]  a on its face kangaroo court hearing, and that is what impeachment is, where they have
[09:02.840 --> 09:08.720]  the decision whether to indict or not in the House, in the full House, and they hear the
[09:08.720 --> 09:14.480]  charges, the House acts as the grand jury, if they bill the indictment, it goes to the
[09:14.480 --> 09:20.600]  Senate for the trial, but we're not to that point after years of manifest crimes, admissions
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.720]  by the White House, they've committed thousands of crimes, just in the spying alone without
[09:25.720 --> 09:33.880]  warrants, having to pass retroactive laws to protect themselves, there's no debating it.
[09:33.880 --> 09:41.600]  But Dennis Kasinich has valiantly fought to get a hearing, and then Conyers, who controls
[09:41.600 --> 09:48.680]  the committee suddenly at the last minute says, oh, by the way, you can't talk bad about
[09:48.680 --> 09:53.080]  the president, you can't criticize him, you can't really discuss anything he's done, and
[09:53.080 --> 09:59.040]  you can't read any of your articles of impeachment, and then the Senate says, can I just read
[09:59.040 --> 10:05.240]  one about lying about WMDs, and we have White House memos saying they were lying premeditatedly,
[10:05.240 --> 10:12.520]  and Conyers says, no, you can't even read that, you can't even read newspaper articles
[10:12.520 --> 10:17.800]  or White House documents in here, and so we will track that, we'll also open the phones
[10:17.800 --> 10:21.000]  because I haven't been able to watch hour after hour of it, I watched a little bit this
[10:21.000 --> 10:25.240]  morning, I've watched some clips online, and YouTube clips of people cheering as Dennis
[10:25.240 --> 10:29.960]  Kasinich comes in, the people in the gallery, but we'll condense it all down and cover whatever
[10:29.960 --> 10:33.320]  is most important today, you listeners who have been watching and are listening to the
[10:33.320 --> 10:37.040]  audio feeds, you are welcome to call in at the bottom of the hour, in fact you can get
[10:37.040 --> 10:46.680]  lined up now at 1-800-259-9231, specifically about the Judiciary Committee hearing that
[10:46.680 --> 10:51.480]  is ongoing, and what you've witnessed and what you have seen there, I've got some of
[10:51.480 --> 10:54.560]  our writers that have been watching it this morning are going to do reports later in the
[10:54.560 --> 11:00.240]  afternoon on it, we'll also post all the news from other sources on infoawards.com and
[11:00.240 --> 11:08.400]  prisonplanet.com for you today, and in the next four hours we will break all of the
[11:08.400 --> 11:13.240]  developments down for you, and as I said, take your phone calls, but I'm asking listeners
[11:13.240 --> 11:17.320]  to call in who have been watching the hearing specifically, I really don't want to open
[11:17.320 --> 11:21.800]  the phones up and have somebody tell me that I'm not a Christian because I speak out against
[11:21.800 --> 11:25.600]  the government and it's not of the Lord to do that, or I don't want to open the phone
[11:25.600 --> 11:33.760]  up and hear from a caller asking why I don't talk about space aliens, I'm asking you listeners
[11:33.760 --> 11:38.920]  and I'm asking people to not call in and fill up the lines with BS, which is what folks
[11:38.920 --> 11:44.640]  do, see we don't screen phone calls here, and so what happens is I occasionally say
[11:44.640 --> 11:49.440]  I have a guest on say about the JFK murder assassination, I want you to call in about
[11:49.440 --> 11:55.520]  that if you have a question, open the phone up and it's never on subject, or I say I
[11:55.520 --> 12:02.480]  want to get your take on Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and their impending implosion, I want
[12:02.480 --> 12:05.360]  to hear your stories of what's happening with you in your house and your mortgage and your
[12:05.360 --> 12:12.000]  home value, and I can take ten phone calls and maybe one person calls in to talk about
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.840]  that, now 95% of the time when we take calls I say it's a free-for-all, whatever you want
[12:16.840 --> 12:21.080]  to bring up, whatever subject you want to discuss, but in the few cases where I need
[12:21.080 --> 12:26.440]  intelligence, I need information, I need your help with things, when I say I want state
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.840]  police to call in and talk about are they getting federal training to go under martial
[12:31.840 --> 12:35.920]  law, and then I get state police emails saying well we tried to call in, your phones are
[12:35.920 --> 12:39.240]  busy, and when I go to the calls it's all about other subjects, so I'm going to tell
[12:39.240 --> 12:44.600]  listeners something, and I'm not mad at the general listeners, but for people that abuse
[12:44.600 --> 12:50.680]  the openness of this show, when I ask for specific people to be able to call in, I'm
[12:50.680 --> 12:55.400]  going to hang up on you if you bring up another subject, when I'm asking for specific information,
[12:55.400 --> 13:01.000]  so other people that have information on that can call in, okay, I mean it's just, it's
[13:01.000 --> 13:09.960]  gotten out of control, completely and totally out of control, 1-800-259-9231 coming up at
[13:09.960 --> 13:13.960]  the bottom of the hour for what you witnessed in the impeachment hearings, okay, and then
[13:13.960 --> 13:17.480]  later we'll be able to codify and watch more of the videos, and I've got people watching
[13:17.480 --> 13:21.160]  and writing stories, but right now I want to hear from you what your response is, what
[13:21.160 --> 13:30.920]  your take is on this whitewash, this kangaroo rigged hearing of just biblical proportions.
[13:30.920 --> 13:35.800]  You're going to be talking to Ted Anderson and Anthony Yasha here in just a moment about
[13:35.800 --> 13:41.280]  Homeland Security visits to the network, very serious issues there, but coming up, US foreclosures
[13:41.280 --> 13:48.760]  double as house prices decline, Ford and GM on the verge of bankruptcy, that's Bloomberg
[13:48.760 --> 13:52.960]  folks, okay, I mean the president is telling you the economy is great and the two automakers
[13:52.960 --> 13:55.360]  are about to go under.
[13:55.360 --> 14:00.360]  Navy prosecutor in Gitmo case says fourth plane shot down, this is incredible.
[14:00.360 --> 14:04.080]  In testimony saying the government shot the plane down, now we already knew that, we already
[14:04.080 --> 14:08.160]  had Air Force colonels and generals on, we've already covered it and told you the name of
[14:08.160 --> 14:14.040]  the pilot who fired two AIM-9 sidewinders into the aircraft, Flight 93, and we're called
[14:14.040 --> 14:15.040]  conspiracy theorist.
[14:15.040 --> 14:20.560]  I mean they had an awards ceremony giving the pilot one of the highest Air Force medals
[14:20.560 --> 14:26.080]  for it, because the general refused to follow orders to stand down and blew that aircraft
[14:26.080 --> 14:31.200]  out of the air, and it was going to go into the capital is what we're getting from the
[14:31.200 --> 14:37.520]  Air Force, in fact that was the testimony, it was quote going into the capital dome,
[14:37.520 --> 14:41.720]  government decapitation, some have said building seven in my film martial law, off of our sources
[14:41.720 --> 14:45.000]  I said the capital, and we're being proven right in testimony.
[14:45.000 --> 14:49.440]  Rumsfeld slipped up three times and said they shot down Flight 93, a bunch of other generals
[14:49.440 --> 14:53.480]  have an open testimony, because everybody knows it.
[14:53.480 --> 14:59.600]  The military did its job and did not follow orders from Dick Cheney and blew that aircraft
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.920]  out of the air, and so they then concocted the Todd Beamer story of let's roll, knowing
[15:04.920 --> 15:13.320]  a bunch of saps would buy into it, okay, and put out their little fake phone call from
[15:13.320 --> 15:19.040]  35,000 feet, which they admit doesn't work, so we're going to cover that too, huge news
[15:19.040 --> 15:24.000]  there, you better thank God the Air Force blew that aircraft out of the air and killed
[15:24.000 --> 15:27.760]  those people, because they would have taken out the capital, we would have been in total
[15:27.760 --> 15:39.840]  martial law, government to require distance education spy cameras, I told you this five
[15:39.840 --> 15:43.400]  years ago, they are going to have cameras watching them in all the schools when you
[15:43.400 --> 15:47.840]  take tests, not just distance learning, soy foods reduced sperm counts, BBC I've told
[15:47.840 --> 15:56.160]  you this for many years, it absolutely fills you full of estrogen or estrogen mimicking
[15:56.160 --> 16:05.120]  plant hormones, and it is just very bad for you, so just get that straight, you want your
[16:05.120 --> 16:11.880]  boys to be super feminine, and your daughters to be ultra feminine, and for the imbalance
[16:11.880 --> 16:17.120]  in estrogen to cause them to get breast cancer, just knock yourselves out, don't listen to
[16:17.120 --> 16:22.200]  me, don't say you weren't warned, police resources are diverted from other problems
[16:22.200 --> 16:26.160]  to prevent terrorism, international herald for being, and then they show pictures of
[16:26.160 --> 16:32.840]  riot cops, the message is protesting terrorism, ACLU obtains key memos, authorizing CI torture
[16:32.840 --> 16:39.120]  methods, wantonimo testimony, US let bin Laden's top bodyguard go, that's in road to tyranny
[16:39.120 --> 16:45.720]  by the way, we told you that six and a half years ago, it is now in the Miami Herald today,
[16:45.720 --> 16:53.080]  they flew 6,000 al-Qaeda commanders to safety, they're all CIA card carriers, just it's unbelievable,
[16:53.080 --> 17:01.680]  the news I've got is all off the charts, Anthony yasa called me, I guess Tuesday, no Wednesday
[17:01.680 --> 17:08.720]  begging for help, Anthony yasa is a great we are changed fellow, a lot of the footage
[17:08.720 --> 17:15.920]  he shot and other shot is in truth rising, he talked about getting a job at genesis,
[17:15.920 --> 17:20.880]  he's done freelance affiliate relations for us, calling AM and FM folks to get more affiliates
[17:20.880 --> 17:23.920]  or to get affiliates to pick up more of the show or pick us up on the weekends, he's
[17:23.920 --> 17:29.300]  done that successfully, and he's worked in the office but as a freelancer contractor
[17:29.300 --> 17:34.960]  up in Minnesota, he has a no criminal record, great guy, other we are changed people, they're
[17:34.960 --> 17:38.920]  some of the best we are changed, very polite, very eloquent, you've seen all of the news
[17:38.920 --> 17:43.720]  talking to McCain, it's made national attention several times, they also went to press conferences,
[17:43.720 --> 17:47.280]  Jesse Ventura wouldn't talk to anybody but them, because he knows who we are changed
[17:47.280 --> 17:55.920]  are and his fans, just they are, even when they're being grabbed on, they go with genesis
[17:55.920 --> 18:00.520]  press passes, a network with hundreds of AM and FM affiliates, one of the largest independent
[18:00.520 --> 18:08.680]  networks in the world, he has an info wars, press pass, we send him the template and then
[18:08.680 --> 18:16.160]  had him laminate it and they arrested him saying he had fake documents a few weeks ago
[18:16.160 --> 18:20.080]  and he didn't want to make a big deal about it at the time, he wanted to make sure that
[18:20.080 --> 18:24.520]  they dropped it and left him alone, then homeland security tried to show up at the show at the
[18:24.520 --> 18:29.800]  office two days ago, Ted was gone in a business meeting, they said they come back, they paranoidly,
[18:29.800 --> 18:33.920]  called to Jesse and said meet me at a restaurant, I don't want to come there, then he said why
[18:33.920 --> 18:37.600]  do you guys think 9-11 is an inside job, so they admitted it was about political harassment
[18:37.600 --> 18:41.640]  said to Ted, why do you guys, why is this Anthony guy thinking 9-11 is an inside job,
[18:41.640 --> 18:45.560]  so they're there saying why do you think it's an inside job and saying we know these are
[18:45.560 --> 18:51.200]  fake documents that he didn't have real press passes and Ted said no, I told him he has a
[18:51.200 --> 18:57.680]  press pass from us, we want him to go report for us, he's been talking to Governor Ventura
[18:57.680 --> 19:03.800]  as well, I mean if you must know about doing a show on Genesis, so all of this is going
[19:03.800 --> 19:10.160]  on, all of this is happening and the guy was getting in Ted's words on the phone with me
[19:10.160 --> 19:15.640]  last night, Ted called me at about 11.30 when I was here at work, pissy is the word, getting
[19:15.640 --> 19:20.560]  pissy with Ted at a restaurant over coffee saying no, it's a fake, it's a fake document,
[19:20.560 --> 19:26.240]  we want to charge him with manufacturing fake press passes, well I mean they happen to have
[19:26.240 --> 19:29.040]  a website that gets hundreds of thousands of hits a month that he wanted to make up
[19:29.040 --> 19:32.520]  a press pass, they said it's we are change was fake, they have a website, they make the
[19:32.520 --> 19:37.240]  news, they have info wars press passes, they have Genesis press passes, they're real and
[19:37.240 --> 19:41.400]  I've had Secret Service here, I'm sick of them coming to my office, we've got them
[19:41.400 --> 19:46.160]  up at Genesis, they are upset that we are affecting change, that we are asking real
[19:46.160 --> 19:50.240]  questions at press conferences and this is an attempt to attack the First Amendment
[19:50.240 --> 19:54.440]  and intimidate free speech with a chilling effect and the Secret Service is going to
[19:54.440 --> 20:01.360]  get sued if they don't leave us alone real fast and I mean personally.
[20:01.360 --> 20:05.560]  On the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[20:05.560 --> 20:10.560]  to retire and live out their golden years, unfortunately with taxation the rising cost
[20:10.560 --> 20:15.400]  of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[20:15.400 --> 20:19.760]  line, is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[20:19.760 --> 20:24.880]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes, these questions
[20:24.880 --> 20:28.640]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll
[20:28.640 --> 20:29.640]  Island.
[20:29.640 --> 20:33.520]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[20:33.520 --> 20:38.480]  power, a gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[20:38.480 --> 20:42.960]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson, I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900's to anyone who
[20:42.960 --> 20:50.280]  purchases this book, call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today, it's critical that the
[20:50.280 --> 20:57.440]  public be made aware of the system, call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237, that's
[20:57.440 --> 20:58.440]  1-800-686-2237.
[20:58.440 --> 21:06.440]  May I have everyone's attention please, I've come with a message of information, 9-11 was
[21:06.440 --> 21:07.440]  an inside job.
[21:07.440 --> 21:10.640]  Do you like being a puppet sir, do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[21:10.640 --> 21:15.320]  How do the American people know that 9-11 was a state, it was engineered by you, David
[21:15.320 --> 21:20.320]  Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the C.F.R., and we sit down and shout out.
[21:20.320 --> 21:25.160]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism
[21:25.160 --> 21:27.200]  to grow at our own door.
[21:27.200 --> 21:32.200]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[21:32.200 --> 21:36.200]  An inside job, how dare you?
[21:36.200 --> 21:43.200]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[21:43.200 --> 21:46.200]  Oh hell, it's breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[21:46.200 --> 21:50.920]  If the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary
[21:50.920 --> 21:51.920]  of 9-11.
[21:51.920 --> 21:57.640]  Please rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[21:57.640 --> 22:00.760]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[22:00.760 --> 22:04.800]  Did you know that pH balance is one of the most important factors in maintaining high
[22:04.800 --> 22:06.800]  energy and vibrant health?
[22:06.800 --> 22:12.000]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 9 or higher.
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.920]  Plasma pH drops combine a unique formula of the most alkaline minerals and elements.
[22:16.920 --> 22:20.920]  This product is a one of a kind in its strength and effectiveness.
[22:20.920 --> 22:25.880]  Using plasma pH drops is one of the best ways to make your water alkaline while helping
[22:25.880 --> 22:29.340]  you get rid of acid and regaining your health and energy.
[22:29.340 --> 22:34.760]  With just 10 drops, you can raise the pH level of the water you drink up to the pH of 10.
[22:34.760 --> 22:40.200]  And alkalizing water helps the body rid itself of acidic waste and increases the oxygen content
[22:40.200 --> 22:41.200]  of your body.
[22:41.200 --> 22:46.440]  Disease organisms like bacteria and cancer cannot survive in an alkaline environment.

[22:52.240 --> 23:00.240]  That's alkavision.com or call 269-344-3420 today.
[23:00.240 --> 23:02.600]  A body, no more pickpocketing for us.
[23:02.600 --> 23:06.280]  I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've
[23:06.280 --> 23:07.280]  been robbed.
[23:07.280 --> 23:08.280]  How so, Clyde?
[23:08.280 --> 23:11.440]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet.
[23:11.440 --> 23:15.040]  Just by waving it near you, I can skin your credit card information while your cards are
[23:15.040 --> 23:16.240]  still in your purse.
[23:16.240 --> 23:17.240]  Just watch.
[23:17.240 --> 23:19.400]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen.
[23:19.400 --> 23:20.800]  You gotta be kidding me.
[23:20.800 --> 23:25.480]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune.
[23:25.480 --> 23:28.000]  As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  Why?
[23:29.000 --> 23:30.440]  What's identity stronghold?
[23:30.440 --> 23:34.240]  They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure
[23:34.240 --> 23:35.560]  sleeve, I can't read them.
[23:35.560 --> 23:38.640]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[23:38.640 --> 23:39.640]  No way.
[23:39.640 --> 23:43.000]  Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.720]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[23:45.720 --> 23:46.800]  I already got some.
[23:46.800 --> 23:49.080]  I also got some to fit our passports.
[23:49.080 --> 23:53.600]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDstronghold.com.
[23:53.600 --> 23:54.600]  IDstronghold.com?
[23:54.600 --> 23:55.600]  Right.
[23:55.600 --> 24:04.000]  Or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.520]  The preacher man says it's the end of time and the Mississippi River she's a gold grime.
[24:11.520 --> 24:15.280]  The secret service agents comment, cad over coffee.
[24:15.280 --> 24:20.200]  The interest is up and the stock market's down and you're only getting mugged if you
[24:20.200 --> 24:21.200]  go downtown.
[24:21.200 --> 24:29.880]  But why would anybody believe 9-11 is an inside job?
[24:29.880 --> 24:37.000]  Makes the connection for the fact that this is political.
[24:37.000 --> 24:43.120]  We have the White House memos going back five years ago that have been all over the news
[24:43.120 --> 24:47.720]  where they tell the secret service to go out and recruit local police to violate people's
[24:47.720 --> 24:51.320]  First Amendment and arrest them for peaceful demonstrations and to put them, quote, in
[24:51.320 --> 24:56.600]  free speech areas where the press cannot see them and they say it's not for security.
[24:56.600 --> 25:00.000]  It is so that the cameras don't see them for political effect.
[25:00.000 --> 25:07.000]  You're caught red handed and you become a secret police intimidation force when you
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.760]  start going around trying to stop VR change, which has gone and protested live TV events
[25:12.760 --> 25:14.360]  on the city streets of New York.
[25:14.360 --> 25:21.640]  God was arrested for that, which has made the news hundreds of times peacefully and has
[25:21.640 --> 25:23.960]  done nothing violent but been assaulted.
[25:23.960 --> 25:29.480]  We have police on video coming up and saying cameras are guns that we have bombs saying
[25:29.480 --> 25:30.760]  we know you don't have bombs.
[25:30.760 --> 25:32.760]  We're going to say you have bombs.
[25:32.760 --> 25:36.600]  That's the whole point of truth rising, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:36.600 --> 25:39.480]  You know what it's like having the secret service at our office here twice?
[25:39.480 --> 25:43.320]  You know what it's like to have a secret service come out twice?
[25:43.320 --> 25:47.040]  You know what it's like for Anthony Johnson to get arrested and saying he has fake press
[25:47.040 --> 25:51.200]  passes and now they want us to lie and say that we didn't give him press passes?
[25:51.200 --> 25:54.120]  We're not going to do it.
[25:54.120 --> 25:55.120]  I want to go to Ted Anderson.
[25:55.120 --> 25:59.520]  We got Anthony Yasa waiting in the wings there who's just one of the best people out there
[25:59.520 --> 26:06.440]  asking questions eloquently, politely at press conferences in America for this network.
[26:06.440 --> 26:10.360]  Ted, this is getting serious and I know you're a calm guy on the air, but you were a little
[26:10.360 --> 26:13.920]  bit mad last night when you talked to me and I like seeing that backbone.
[26:13.920 --> 26:15.640]  You said that you're getting sick of this.
[26:15.640 --> 26:17.640]  Oh, there's no question about it, Alex.
[26:17.640 --> 26:22.040]  I mean, what they're trying to do is they're trying to pick on Anthony here.
[26:22.040 --> 26:25.600]  He's a complete, peaceful, asking questions.
[26:25.600 --> 26:31.760]  I guess you can't ask questions about 9-11 at a news conference for John McCain.
[26:31.760 --> 26:35.400]  Otherwise, you can expect to have visits from the secret service.
[26:35.400 --> 26:39.600]  From what I understand, not only have they confronted Anthony Yasa, they've been talking
[26:39.600 --> 26:42.640]  to us, is a fiance, girlfriend, wife.
[26:42.640 --> 26:44.240]  I don't know what the relationship is.
[26:44.240 --> 26:45.240]  It's a fiance.
[26:45.240 --> 26:48.680]  When he's at work, they come to her and say, so you're planning violence.
[26:48.680 --> 26:52.440]  Let us in your computers right now without warrants trying to intimidate their way in
[26:52.440 --> 26:53.440]  on a woman.
[26:53.440 --> 26:59.080]  I can tell you right now, I know no violent, nothing, I've never seen that in Anthony at
[26:59.080 --> 27:00.080]  all.
[27:00.080 --> 27:03.400]  I don't think he has any intentions to- Of course not.
[27:03.400 --> 27:04.720]  They know that.
[27:04.720 --> 27:05.720]  They know that.
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.560]  They're there to try to scare everybody from going out and asking questions to John McCain
[27:09.560 --> 27:11.440]  when it makes it on four or five networks.
[27:11.440 --> 27:12.440]  Well, that's the thing.
[27:12.440 --> 27:16.120]  What they're trying to pin on him right now is that he had false documents, but he doesn't
[27:16.120 --> 27:17.920]  have false documents.
[27:17.920 --> 27:21.880]  The guy's trying to- He's thinking that I'm trying to cover for him, that he made these
[27:21.880 --> 27:24.280]  documents and now I'm saying I gave him permission.
[27:24.280 --> 27:29.920]  I gave him permission long before- We've had Anthony on five times on this show reporting
[27:29.920 --> 27:32.040]  as an InfoWars Genesis reporter.
[27:32.040 --> 27:34.120]  Yeah, that's the whole thing.
[27:34.120 --> 27:36.200]  He had his own cubicle at the office.
[27:36.200 --> 27:37.200]  It's ridiculous.
[27:37.200 --> 27:40.840]  If you're telling that, you pay him.
[27:40.840 --> 27:45.760]  He goes out and he does work for us.
[27:45.760 --> 27:46.760]  That's the whole point about it, Alex.
[27:46.760 --> 27:50.360]  I mean, they're trying to pin this all on him.
[27:50.360 --> 27:53.360]  What they're trying to do is they're trying to probably make him into a scapegoat or something.
[27:53.360 --> 27:58.000]  What it is, is that I don't have Ryan Slick-Eyes and working for me full-time who would make
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.000]  these beautiful press passes, and so we just send the template out and say, laminate it
[28:02.000 --> 28:06.440]  yourself with their name and picture on it, and that's how the press works.
[28:06.440 --> 28:07.840]  It doesn't matter.
[28:07.840 --> 28:08.840]  He's here reporting.
[28:08.840 --> 28:11.200]  He comes and says, I'm pressed from We Are Change.
[28:11.200 --> 28:14.880]  They say that's a fake press pass when it's his website and his news group.
[28:14.880 --> 28:19.040]  I mean, we're allowed as Americans to go to events and ask questions.
[28:19.040 --> 28:20.040]  This is insane.
[28:20.040 --> 28:22.360]  Oh, these are open public events for McCain.
[28:22.360 --> 28:26.080]  I mean, anybody could show up and say their press and ask questions.
[28:26.080 --> 28:33.360]  Well, and Dan Thiel with the Secret Service, the guy that met with me, was saying that
[28:33.360 --> 28:37.320]  we don't have the right to do that, that we don't have a right to create a pass and end
[28:37.320 --> 28:42.480]  up on a podium with the press, and the fact of the matter is, and I asked him straight
[28:42.480 --> 28:44.360]  up, I said, what is the press?
[28:44.360 --> 28:50.560]  I've got 200 AM and FM stations that pick up our stuff here and play it on air.
[28:50.560 --> 28:51.560]  We are the press.
[28:51.560 --> 28:52.640]  I mean, what do you have to have?
[28:52.640 --> 28:53.640]  A newspaper?
[28:53.640 --> 28:57.040]  Maybe you have to have a membership with the CIA or something.
[28:57.040 --> 28:58.040]  No, no.
[28:58.040 --> 28:59.160]  There's only a few places.
[28:59.160 --> 29:06.240]  They have congressional press passes issued by Congress for the Capitol building to get
[29:06.240 --> 29:10.040]  into committee meetings, and they know that it's all color of law.
[29:10.040 --> 29:12.080]  They think we're stupid.
[29:12.080 --> 29:15.040]  They're scared of the American people becoming the press.
[29:15.040 --> 29:17.160]  That's why they want to shut down the web.
[29:17.160 --> 29:19.080]  That is exactly what they're doing.
[29:19.080 --> 29:23.000]  And so the Secret Service is now telling Ted Anderson, you don't have a right to send
[29:23.000 --> 29:24.600]  reporters to events.
[29:24.600 --> 29:26.720]  This is outrageous.
[29:26.720 --> 29:27.720]  Stay there, Ted.
[29:27.720 --> 29:30.920]  This is Anthony Yasha on the other side.
[29:30.920 --> 29:33.880]  This is the battle for the republic, ladies and gentlemen.
[29:33.880 --> 29:34.880]  We're trying to send reporters.
[29:34.880 --> 29:40.840]  I think we ought to pull up some of the YouTube clips of We Are Change Minnesota asking questions.
[29:40.840 --> 29:45.000]  These are the people that have just been doing such a great job, and the Secret Service wants
[29:45.000 --> 29:46.000]  it to stop.
[29:46.000 --> 29:51.920]  They don't want questions to Bill Clinton or Hillary or Barack Obama or to John McCain.
[29:51.920 --> 29:53.200]  We're on the march.
[29:53.200 --> 29:55.680]  The empire's on the run.
[29:55.680 --> 30:01.400]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.400 --> 30:03.360]  Our beloved republic is on her knees.
[30:03.360 --> 30:07.040]  The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[30:07.040 --> 30:09.400]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope.
[30:09.400 --> 30:12.440]  The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[30:12.440 --> 30:16.680]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New
[30:16.680 --> 30:18.200]  World Order master plan.
[30:18.200 --> 30:22.440]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.
[30:22.440 --> 30:27.640]  In the Info War, PrisonPlanet.tv is a powerful weapon in the battle to regain our freedom.

[30:59.760 --> 31:01.800]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[31:01.800 --> 31:05.960]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that
[31:05.960 --> 31:09.960]  you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking
[31:09.960 --> 31:10.960]  the water?
[31:10.960 --> 31:14.600]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed
[31:14.600 --> 31:15.760]  into the skin.

[33:23.520 --> 33:24.520]  next week.
[33:24.520 --> 33:28.680]  That's right folks, we work seven days a week here in the fight against the new world order
[33:28.680 --> 33:34.000]  because we are in desperate times, desperate straits.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.640]  Fascism is being brought into the United States, they're about to change horses and pass it
[33:37.640 --> 33:40.840]  on to Barack Obama who's called for world government.
[33:40.840 --> 33:41.840]  That is coming up.
[33:41.840 --> 33:45.840]  We've also got the Senate valiantly fighting against the tyranny, we're going to be taking
[33:45.840 --> 33:50.960]  your calls at 1-800-25 at 99-231 coming up and what you've been witnessing with the impeachment
[33:50.960 --> 33:56.200]  hearings going for the last four hours, last three and a half hours if you want to be technical.
[33:56.200 --> 34:01.640]  I just want to be clear that when George Bush and there was that whole two month long election
[34:01.640 --> 34:09.320]  fight in 2000 with Al Gore, I would try to peacefully go down and videotape the governor's
[34:09.320 --> 34:14.680]  mansion with hundreds of reporters and scores of news agencies, hundreds of newspapers.
[34:14.680 --> 34:20.040]  They had pro-Gore, pro-Bush people running around, hitting each other with signs, the
[34:20.040 --> 34:21.840]  Secret Service would ignore that.
[34:21.840 --> 34:27.120]  The Secret Service guys were dressed up kind of in gang member outfits, these disguises
[34:27.120 --> 34:28.280]  were unbelievable.
[34:28.280 --> 34:35.120]  You'd have like a 45, 50 year old gray haired white guy with big bling, Mercedes Ben Gold
[34:35.120 --> 34:40.320]  chains, bling hanging around his neck and they'd come up and shove me and say, where
[34:40.320 --> 34:41.320]  you parked Alex?
[34:41.320 --> 34:42.320]  What you doing Alex?
[34:42.320 --> 34:43.320]  You need to get out of here Alex.
[34:43.320 --> 34:46.800]  You need to be in here Alex and they'd look just like a criminal out of a movie or a gangster
[34:46.800 --> 34:51.320]  and I'd be like, I'm here videotaping what's going on and covering this and you need to
[34:51.320 --> 34:55.280]  stop it and then, oh, I turn around they bump into me, oh sorry I bumped into you, oh you
[34:55.280 --> 34:56.280]  need to do something.
[34:56.280 --> 35:00.200]  You know, I'll never forget that one little guy who was about five foot two and there
[35:00.200 --> 35:05.040]  were other people, folks that were definitely special ops and I'd say, oh, now we got Navy
[35:05.040 --> 35:08.400]  Seals out here and they'd laugh and go, hi Jones.
[35:08.400 --> 35:11.960]  You know those guys walking around were a little more professional than the, and they're
[35:11.960 --> 35:16.320]  playing clothes than the Secret Service, following us to our car.
[35:16.320 --> 35:20.920]  So I said, that's it, I'm coming back with a bullhorn, came out with a bullhorn, ABC
[35:20.920 --> 35:25.160]  News, Cameraman, runs across the street, punches me in the throat, state police run over and
[35:25.160 --> 35:29.480]  say, yes we saw him, hit you, but we're going to arrest you if you do anything back and
[35:29.480 --> 35:31.800]  I was just like you people are unbelievable.
[35:31.800 --> 35:35.480]  I'm the bad one because I'm the good guy, I'm the guy defending America, I'm the guy
[35:35.480 --> 35:39.480]  that knows what's going on, we're the people that understand what's happening.
[35:39.480 --> 35:44.360]  Now, we've had Secret Service out here twice, and now every day on YouTube I see threats
[35:44.360 --> 35:47.640]  to the president, threats to this and that, they never get investigated, never stop, it's
[35:47.640 --> 35:51.640]  just all over the web now, I'm going to do this to Obama, we're going to do this to Bush,
[35:51.640 --> 35:54.840]  we're going to do this to everybody, threat, threat, threat, threat, threat, you know,
[35:54.840 --> 35:58.040]  with these anonymous people saying, I'm going to do this and I'm going to do that.
[35:58.040 --> 36:02.640]  Nothing happens, but we've had these little provocateurs go on our message boards and
[36:02.640 --> 36:09.040]  try to do it, you know, again trying to cause us problems, and then we've got the same IP
[36:09.040 --> 36:14.320]  addresses, we can go look, then tattling on themselves above it and pointing it out, look,
[36:14.320 --> 36:18.360]  they're calling for violence and it's the same IP address.
[36:18.360 --> 36:23.320]  So they know that we are changed as peaceful, they know that Anthony Yasha is peaceful, they
[36:23.320 --> 36:28.720]  know what's going on, and they're now telling Ted Anderson, this is the key, why do you guys
[36:28.720 --> 36:33.640]  think 9-11's an inside job, why do your reporters think that, that's weird, that's, by the way,
[36:33.640 --> 36:38.520]  you can't issue people press passes, what do you think it is when it's a local Minnesota
[36:38.520 --> 36:45.480]  paper, a local TV station, or a local blogger, they come and you just get accredited to get
[36:45.480 --> 36:46.480]  in.
[36:46.480 --> 36:49.800]  You call the event, that John McCain's going to be at in two days, or Barack Obama, and
[36:49.800 --> 36:53.760]  you say, yeah, I want to be at that town hall meeting in the press box, and they say, okay,
[36:53.760 --> 36:57.560]  we're already full up, or you can be in the outside press box and, you know, okay, and
[36:57.560 --> 37:04.160]  they give you a press pass, okay, and that's how that works, or if it's a public event,
[37:04.160 --> 37:06.080]  you can just go in and go get in the press area.
[37:06.080 --> 37:08.960]  I can tell you how many times when Governor Bush was governor, I'd go to one of his press
[37:08.960 --> 37:12.400]  conferences, and he's there to give a speech, and you just show up and walk right in, nobody
[37:12.400 --> 37:13.400]  stops you.
[37:13.400 --> 37:14.400]  They're open to the event.
[37:14.400 --> 37:18.440]  Now at the DuPont photo masking plant, when I asked him a peaceful question about the
[37:18.440 --> 37:24.600]  Federal Reserve destroying America with a fiat currency in 1998, they had me kidnapped for
[37:24.600 --> 37:28.320]  an hour, it's all on video, grabbed, in fact, John, I've sent you that audio, let's play
[37:28.320 --> 37:35.560]  that coming up, and they grabbed me almost, you know, dislocated my shoulder, I still roll
[37:35.560 --> 37:39.240]  over in the middle of the night sometimes and have just incredible spasms of pain into
[37:39.240 --> 37:44.320]  my shoulder from the Williamson County constables and the state police, protective services,
[37:44.320 --> 37:48.600]  almost ripping my arm out of the socket, putting my fist all the way up behind my back to the
[37:48.600 --> 37:53.240]  center top of my back, and they're going, you're going down, boy, trap him up against
[37:53.240 --> 37:57.160]  the wall and shove him in my head into the glass and giggling about it, attacking free
[37:57.160 --> 38:01.680]  speech, attacking America, and I have had enough of it.
[38:01.680 --> 38:07.280]  We will ask our questions, we will go to press conferences, and we're on two affiliates
[38:07.280 --> 38:11.280]  that are in Chicago, one's outside Chicago, one's in Chicago, we air the show at night
[38:11.280 --> 38:12.280]  in the morning.
[38:12.280 --> 38:17.120]  We're on in Kansas City, we're on in Niagara Falls, we're on in Rochester, we're on outside
[38:17.120 --> 38:24.040]  Tampa, we're on in Austin, Texas, we're on 590, we're on 1330 in Taylor right here in
[38:24.040 --> 38:29.760]  Austin, we're on KCA in San Diego, we're on affiliates in Montana, we're in affiliates
[38:29.760 --> 38:37.240]  in Utah, we're on affiliates just all Tennessee, WBCR, Knoxville, all over the place.
[38:37.240 --> 38:42.600]  I have the number one show on the internet for radio, not just AM and FM, international
[38:42.600 --> 38:49.240]  short waves, satellites, we lease an ABC Star Guide feed, feeding the stations, all of this
[38:49.240 --> 38:53.520]  is media as it gets.
[38:53.520 --> 38:57.120]  I'm a guest on national television shows, the biggest radio shows in the country.
[38:57.120 --> 39:01.840]  I have reporters, and the Secret Service just says to the guy that is the owner of the network
[39:01.840 --> 39:08.200]  that syndicates my radio show saying, you aren't allowed, Mr. Anderson, and by extension
[39:08.200 --> 39:14.000]  Alex Jones, to have a press pass, you're not allowed to send reporters.
[39:14.000 --> 39:19.960]  That is illegal, that is against the law, Ted exactly, what did the Secret Service man
[39:19.960 --> 39:23.640]  say, and then I want to go to Anthony Yasha, what did he say about, you're not allowed
[39:23.640 --> 39:25.200]  to issue press passes to Anderson?
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.480]  No, what he was really alluding to is, he's alluding to the fact that Anthony Yasha had
[39:30.480 --> 39:36.720]  made these press passes without consent from Genesis Communications Network, and I said
[39:36.720 --> 39:38.000]  that's not true.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.760]  Anthony Yasha had permission personally from me to have a press press from Genesis Communications
[39:42.760 --> 39:43.760]  Network.
[39:43.760 --> 39:49.560]  What they're trying to do is they're trying to pin on Anthony that he had falsified documents,
[39:49.560 --> 39:57.840]  and to me, the bottom line is that they don't want us there, they don't want us asking questions,
[39:57.840 --> 40:02.760]  and to me the whole point is, hey, if you're going to ask about 9-11 over at a press conference
[40:02.760 --> 40:06.880]  when you have John McCain there, perhaps even Barack Obama, you're going to have the Secret
[40:06.880 --> 40:10.520]  Service all over you, and you might as well be ready for that, but I also told the Secret
[40:10.520 --> 40:13.640]  Service guy, I said, you know, whatever you do to Anthony, don't think that's going to
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.960]  make it stop, because these guys are all over the United States, they're everywhere.
[40:17.960 --> 40:22.520]  They will be at these press conferences, and they'll be asking these questions, and they
[40:22.520 --> 40:32.080]  should be, and we have Jesse Ventura and all these other mainstream, high-profile people
[40:32.080 --> 40:34.760]  that are asking the same questions, I don't think they can get away from it.
[40:34.760 --> 40:38.400]  We have German Defense Minister's great point, we have German Defense Minister's former
[40:38.400 --> 40:44.080]  Italian presidents, former CIA section chief Berlin, Bill Christensen, former top CIA briefer
[40:44.080 --> 40:50.600]  Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Senior Ray McGovern, Mr. Baer, Bob Baer, the individual that Siriana
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.680]  has made about one of the most famous living CIA commanders, field commanders, saying inside
[40:54.680 --> 40:57.960]  job on this show, are they going to get Secret Service visits?
[40:57.960 --> 41:04.160]  Here's another one, here is the Miami Herald Guantanamo testimony, U.S. let bin Laden's
[41:04.160 --> 41:10.240]  top bodyguard go, and they go on to say that they grabbed 12-14-year-old villagers and
[41:10.240 --> 41:15.480]  keep them for six years, but that when they got bin Laden's top bodyguard, they immediately
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.560]  let him go quietly, that's because they're CIA, and the troops, this has been in mainstream
[41:20.560 --> 41:25.640]  news, kept capturing real Taliban in al-Qaeda, and in fact the troops had captured 6,000
[41:25.640 --> 41:30.480]  of them during the invasion in 2001, 2002, they were ordered to release them and even
[41:30.480 --> 41:34.240]  give them money, give them gold, and that came out in mainstream news, that's in my
[41:34.240 --> 41:39.040]  film, Road to Terran, he's six and a half plus years old, the first major 9-11 film,
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.240]  and it's all mainstream news, but back of the paper, that they're protecting al-Qaeda,
[41:44.240 --> 41:50.960]  and I have another report here, infowars.net, but it's from Reuters, we point out Reuters,
[41:50.960 --> 41:56.760]  this is from Reuters, Navy prosecutor in Gitmo case, fourth plane shot down, bin Laden driver
[41:56.760 --> 42:01.160]  case contains revealing details, through the trial of the man dubbed, it's only bin Laden's
[42:01.160 --> 42:06.640]  driver, when they released his real protector, CIA protector officer, as primarily functioning
[42:06.640 --> 42:10.720]  as a showpiece for Bush administration, war on terror, some interesting information emerged
[42:10.720 --> 42:14.960]  from the Guantanamo Bay, Naval base yesterday, in the form of a directed mission, from the
[42:14.960 --> 42:19.040]  US prosecutor that the fourth plane was shot down, the revolution came during assertions
[42:19.040 --> 42:25.120]  from representatives, for the prosecution that Salim Ahmadine, Ahmadine had detailed
[42:25.120 --> 42:30.600]  knowledge of the intended target of the fourth hijacked plane on 9-11, and it quoted, if
[42:30.600 --> 42:34.080]  they hadn't shot down the fourth plane, it would have hit the dome of the capital, stone
[42:34.080 --> 42:37.120]  a Navy officer said in the opening remarks, and we'll cover this more later.
[42:37.120 --> 42:44.040]  The point is, cops, military, secret service, don't go demand Ted Anderson come meet you
[42:44.040 --> 42:47.880]  at a coffee shop, because you're quote afraid, we're going to surveil you, and then tell
[42:47.880 --> 42:53.040]  us we're crazy about 9-11, when we know how to read newspapers, buddy, when we know how
[42:53.040 --> 42:56.120]  to interview Norman Manetta, that's what we are, change went and did, saying no, Dick
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.200]  Cheney's lying, I was in the bunker with him, as the whole hijacking thing started,
[43:00.200 --> 43:03.520]  Cheney tried to lie and say he got there later, you know, I mean we're going to keep
[43:03.520 --> 43:05.160]  bringing this out, okay?
[43:05.160 --> 43:08.840]  You may think it's cute and funny, the government killed 3,000 of us, but we don't think it's
[43:08.840 --> 43:12.960]  funny, we have to have the courage and the will to come out and expose this.
[43:12.960 --> 43:17.680]  Well that's another thing too, Alex, is that the normal everyday people, including the
[43:17.680 --> 43:22.880]  secret service people are, you know, they don't want to take the idea of the fact that
[43:22.880 --> 43:28.080]  there could be a conspiracy, if you will, use those words, obviously as a conspiracy,
[43:28.080 --> 43:32.400]  with these airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, and that it might not be some
[43:32.400 --> 43:37.360]  guy from a cave that ran this whole thing and made the whole operation occur.
[43:37.360 --> 43:42.000]  You know, I asked the guy myself, I said, well explain to me how two towers got hit
[43:42.000 --> 43:46.200]  by airplanes and three ended up falling, and why did they look like controlled demolitions,
[43:46.200 --> 43:49.000]  and he said, I don't know, you know, he didn't have an answer.
[43:49.000 --> 43:53.080]  And why did a secret service agent go to investigate and got capped in the head?
[43:53.080 --> 43:56.640]  Inside Building 7's the info we've got, I mean, I bet he didn't even know a secret service
[43:56.640 --> 44:01.200]  guy died in there, I bet he didn't know the head of FBI counterterrorism who just retired
[44:01.200 --> 44:06.440]  saying, telling the British newspapers the government is going to let bin Laden hit probably
[44:06.440 --> 44:10.920]  the World Trade Center in the next few months as a pretext to invade Afghanistan and launch
[44:10.920 --> 44:12.480]  a war on terror.
[44:12.480 --> 44:13.480]  John O'Neill.
[44:13.480 --> 44:15.320]  Oh, you didn't know about that secret service.
[44:15.320 --> 44:21.720]  Well, why don't you use your investigative skills to investigate the truth?
[44:21.720 --> 44:25.680]  Why don't you find out the truth that you were based in that building of the CIA?
[44:25.680 --> 44:29.080]  Okay, let's bring Anthony up.
[44:29.080 --> 44:31.880]  Anthony, this is incredible.
[44:31.880 --> 44:39.640]  Tell folks about what happened with them now visiting your fiance when you were at work,
[44:39.640 --> 44:44.320]  and now they're saying that, telling your girlfriend that they think that we are changes
[44:44.320 --> 44:50.640]  planning to try to attack Barack Obama when we've written articles talking about out of
[44:50.640 --> 44:54.800]  the Dallas Morning News first reported that the secret service is pulling protection off
[44:54.800 --> 44:59.440]  of him and not looking for guns when people go in to events with him.
[44:59.440 --> 45:04.520]  So they're the ones that are leaving the door open like they did in Dallas 44 years
[45:04.520 --> 45:05.520]  ago.
[45:05.520 --> 45:07.520]  Anthony, this is insane.
[45:07.520 --> 45:14.160]  Oh, it's really getting the sickening to the point where, I mean, that they show up
[45:14.160 --> 45:19.920]  and if they're, I don't know if they planned on making sure they showed up when I was gone,
[45:19.920 --> 45:26.200]  but it sure seems that way and just how they sit there and try to, they try to act like
[45:26.200 --> 45:31.400]  Colombo like they're, they're playing stupid, but they know something, but I mean, I guess
[45:31.400 --> 45:36.280]  my biggest question, I mean, these guys do take an oath to uphold the Constitution.
[45:36.280 --> 45:37.280]  Do they not?
[45:37.280 --> 45:41.520]  I mean, if they're an intelligence agency and that they can sit there and ask people
[45:41.520 --> 45:45.640]  like Ted and stuff why we would think 9-11 was an inside job and waste all these state
[45:45.640 --> 45:51.840]  resources driving from my house to Genesis to Jamie's house up north and Maple Grove
[45:51.840 --> 45:58.040]  and just, I mean, consider looking at the definition of terrorism by Webster that's
[45:58.040 --> 46:03.720]  the systematic use of violence, terror and intimidation to an achievement and that's
[46:03.720 --> 46:04.720]  exactly what I see.
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.520]  I mean, I don't scare very easily and just what they've been pulling since that McCain
[46:09.520 --> 46:10.520]  event.
[46:10.520 --> 46:15.880]  I feel like they're running around in the shadows plotting and planning.
[46:15.880 --> 46:18.280]  Well, they've got to protect the terrorists that carried out the attack.
[46:18.280 --> 46:21.280]  That's the most important thing for the criminals that run our government and you've got a lot
[46:21.280 --> 46:22.280]  of useful idiots.
[46:22.280 --> 46:26.520]  These guys probably even believe what they're saying and drunk in the Kool-Aid like Hitler's
[46:26.520 --> 46:34.320]  SS, his Secret Service, but expanding on this and their new role is the new Gestapo in America,
[46:34.320 --> 46:36.160]  the front line of that, whether they like it or not.
[46:36.160 --> 46:39.920]  That's just the fact they've engaged in intimidation attacks on the First Amendment, high crimes
[46:39.920 --> 46:42.560]  and misdemeanors, the entire agency has.
[46:42.560 --> 46:45.720]  We have their own memos where they are there to stop free speech.
[46:45.720 --> 46:47.280]  They don't want cameras on protesters.
[46:47.280 --> 46:51.040]  Now, to be specific, they kind of force their way in on your girlfriend and then say, well,
[46:51.040 --> 46:52.960]  let us search your computers.
[46:52.960 --> 46:57.040]  Why are you planning to go after Barack Obama to try to put words in her mouth?
[46:57.040 --> 46:58.040]  Tell folks what they were doing.
[46:58.040 --> 46:59.040]  Yeah.
[46:59.040 --> 47:02.840]  Like I said, when they first showed up here, my fiance was upstairs.
[47:02.840 --> 47:07.720]  We live in a split house and they actually ran into our landlord downstairs and they
[47:07.720 --> 47:11.600]  told her, I mean, she's a pretty smart girl, she can see a salesman or whatever you want
[47:11.600 --> 47:19.320]  to call them a mile away and they were trying to basically flick-talk her into giving them
[47:19.320 --> 47:23.400]  permission to just come in the house and she's like, well, if you don't, you can go in if
[47:23.400 --> 47:28.120]  you got a warrant and if you don't, you can't and you can ring the doorbell though and she
[47:28.120 --> 47:34.520]  comes down and they just play polite and I mean, like say, like the Colombo where they're
[47:34.520 --> 47:40.600]  like, they don't really know what's going on, but they do supposedly and they came up
[47:40.600 --> 47:41.600]  in the living room.
[47:41.600 --> 47:44.120]  There was one, I'm not sure the name because I wasn't here.
[47:44.120 --> 47:49.960]  We only caught the last name and I believe that is the same one that called Ted and got
[47:49.960 --> 47:54.120]  into our living room basically and then it was like, well, where do you keep your computers?
[47:54.120 --> 47:58.040]  Are you guys gonna, are you guys planning on harming Barack Obama?
[47:58.040 --> 48:05.920]  I mean, if you guys are supposedly the investigators and your top national security supposedly,
[48:05.920 --> 48:08.560]  you would know that we are no threat.
[48:08.560 --> 48:11.200]  It would take five to 10 minutes of research just.
[48:11.200 --> 48:15.120]  But you are a threat through your political speech under the First Amendment.
[48:15.120 --> 48:18.360]  America and freedom is the threat to their tyranny.
[48:18.360 --> 48:26.760]  Exactly, we are, I mean, exposing what's going on and people that are riding around this
[48:26.760 --> 48:29.360]  country and even other countries now protecting it.
[48:29.360 --> 48:32.760]  Yeah, I need Kurt Nemo or Steve Watson or somebody to put an article together.
[48:32.760 --> 48:36.200]  I just saw him again in the news last week with those White House memos to the Secret
[48:36.200 --> 48:42.680]  Service saying, you know, use local police, have them intimidate and violate people's
[48:42.680 --> 48:46.400]  rights, stop them from having their speech, stop them from being able to be in front
[48:46.400 --> 48:47.400]  of news cameras.
[48:47.400 --> 48:49.720]  I mean, it's all about political aim.
[48:49.720 --> 48:52.400]  They know you're no threat, Anthony.
[48:52.400 --> 48:57.640]  Now they're trying to set you up on false documents, do not talk to them.
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.800]  They will lie and say that you gave false statements to a federal officer, their favorite
[49:01.800 --> 49:05.240]  Byzantine false law of imprisoning people.
[49:05.240 --> 49:09.000]  And from this point on, if they show up at my office, I'm not talking to them because,
[49:09.000 --> 49:12.600]  you know, they show up and say, we want the IP address of this person making a threat.
[49:12.600 --> 49:15.800]  I said, okay, I'll email it to you because, you know, obviously we don't want their own
[49:15.800 --> 49:18.680]  goons on our websites doing that.
[49:18.680 --> 49:23.720]  But from this point on, I am not going to tell them, listen, your comrades are engaging
[49:23.720 --> 49:29.480]  in violations of the First Amendment, serious violations of trying to chill the First Amendment
[49:29.480 --> 49:33.840]  and set ups and the rest of it, so just don't come around here and don't violate my rights
[49:33.840 --> 49:35.160]  or I will personally sue you.
[49:35.160 --> 49:37.840]  You'll probably beat the rat, but you won't beat the ride.
[49:37.840 --> 49:39.280]  Stop violating my First Amendment.
[49:39.280 --> 49:40.280]  Leave me alone.
[49:40.280 --> 49:44.200]  You know, I was enough to be all over Virginia for Bilderberg and to have goon after goon
[49:44.200 --> 49:45.200]  following us.
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.040]  And you'd see them the next day in a clown mask following you and we got video of that
[49:49.040 --> 49:52.440]  and, you know, everywhere and then coming up to us in the restaurant and say, oh, hi,
[49:52.440 --> 49:53.440]  Alex, I'm a fan.
[49:53.440 --> 49:56.040]  Do you want to attack the State Department with me?
[49:56.040 --> 50:01.080]  And I'm like, come on, Fed, no, we're nonviolent and you know that.
[50:01.080 --> 50:05.120]  And then it was just giggling and smirking and laughing and just, you know, we don't
[50:05.120 --> 50:06.960]  deal with narcotics like your bosses do.
[50:06.960 --> 50:09.840]  We don't carry out terror attacks like your bosses do.
[50:09.840 --> 50:14.400]  We don't do biological and chemical testing, tens of thousands of instances declassified
[50:14.400 --> 50:16.640]  against the American people like your bosses do.
[50:16.640 --> 50:19.160]  We didn't devalue the dollar like your bosses did.
[50:19.160 --> 50:22.560]  We didn't run child kidnapping rings like your bosses did all over the news.
[50:22.560 --> 50:26.800]  You know, we don't have hundreds of gay porn stars and madams in the White House like your
[50:26.800 --> 50:27.960]  bosses do.
[50:27.960 --> 50:30.880]  We're just normal people that don't want to be slaves, okay?
[50:30.880 --> 50:32.280]  Let's just get that straight.
[50:32.280 --> 50:36.120]  Well, Anthony, we've got your six, as they say.
[50:36.120 --> 50:39.600]  And you're not going to get into this intimidation, are you going to intensify your First Amendment
[50:39.600 --> 50:40.600]  actions?
[50:40.600 --> 50:44.480]  Well, somebody told me the other day, and I, like I said, did definitely throw a chill
[50:44.480 --> 50:48.400]  through me, but he said, I mean, by the way, the way they went about this is like trying
[50:48.400 --> 50:50.280]  to put out a fire with gasoline.
[50:50.280 --> 50:52.280]  What do you mean they put a chill on you?
[50:52.280 --> 50:55.400]  Well, just a scare effect, I mean, it affected me.
[50:55.400 --> 50:56.400]  Stay there.
[50:56.400 --> 50:57.400]  I want to hear about that.
[50:57.400 --> 50:58.720]  But they were scared to come into Genesis.
[50:58.720 --> 51:02.920]  They thought Cad would videotape them.
[51:02.920 --> 51:06.640]  Did you know the accumulation of acidic waste in the body is the single largest cause of
[51:06.640 --> 51:11.600]  disease such as cancer or diabetes, acidic waste is created by the types of food we eat,
[51:11.600 --> 51:14.920]  what we drink, the environment, and our high stress lifestyles.
[51:14.920 --> 51:19.040]  It's these choices that cause decreased energy, weight gain, and eventually disease.
[51:19.040 --> 51:23.520]  The easiest way to reduce disease causing acidic waste is by drinking alkaline ionized
[51:23.520 --> 51:24.520]  water.

[53:01.840 --> 53:07.080]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[53:07.080 --> 53:10.960]  on and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[53:10.960 --> 53:16.240]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform
[53:16.240 --> 53:17.880]  to tell their story.
[53:17.880 --> 53:26.800]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[53:26.800 --> 53:31.560]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[53:31.560 --> 53:33.840]  take action against their global masters.
[53:33.840 --> 53:37.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[53:37.000 --> 53:42.800]  He takes his hand off and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[53:42.800 --> 53:49.720]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide, download Truth Rising at www.prisonplanet.tv
[53:49.720 --> 53:54.840]  and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at www.infowars.com.
[53:54.840 --> 53:58.520]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[53:58.520 --> 54:25.520]  and bring in martial law.
[54:25.520 --> 54:30.960]  We Are Changed Colorado has exposed three separate groups who are openly planning violence
[54:30.960 --> 54:38.080]  at the DNC connected to the FBI and connected to other groups going back into the 80s and
[54:38.080 --> 54:43.440]  60s that had been involved in provocateur actions and we got it in the Denver Post three
[54:43.440 --> 54:45.880]  times in a bunch of other newspapers.
[54:45.880 --> 54:51.440]  It was in the Denver Post yesterday linked to info wars following our reporting saying
[54:51.440 --> 54:54.160]  good, they're trying to stop provocateurs.
[54:54.160 --> 54:56.600]  You understand terrorist, it's over.
[54:56.600 --> 55:01.720]  We know we caught you in Manabello for the North American Union summit with cops dressed
[55:01.720 --> 55:05.640]  up like anarchists and all the major news had to report that you staged attacks on
[55:05.640 --> 55:09.640]  police over, game over.
[55:09.640 --> 55:14.160]  This isn't like the 60s where there's just a group or two you can target and set up.
[55:14.160 --> 55:15.160]  It's not going to stop.
[55:15.160 --> 55:16.240]  You understand?
[55:16.240 --> 55:19.080]  We are stopping the violence in Minnesota.
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.960]  We are stopping the provocateurs in Denver for the DNC.
[55:22.960 --> 55:24.440]  We are the opposite.
[55:24.440 --> 55:30.920]  I make films about exposing provocateurs, police state to the takeover.
[55:30.920 --> 55:35.320]  The We Are Changed folks are people we woke up, people that we taught.
[55:35.320 --> 55:36.320]  You understand?
[55:36.320 --> 55:38.120]  We know your game plan.
[55:38.120 --> 55:41.480]  We are exposing you the provocateurs.
[55:41.480 --> 55:44.440]  Now tell me about this call, this other call that was a chilling.
[55:44.440 --> 55:50.440]  Oh, just that they would show up at my house and then literally within 20 minutes after
[55:50.440 --> 55:57.040]  being here I called one of my associates here for Minnesota We Are Changed and he just got
[55:57.040 --> 55:58.520]  the hunch to call.
[55:58.520 --> 56:03.640]  Our other guy, Jamie, that was involved at the town hall, the meeting and pretty much
[56:03.640 --> 56:07.800]  by the time you had given him a call, literally when he got off the phone saying, I guess
[56:07.800 --> 56:11.880]  Anthony's girlfriend got visited by Secret Service.
[56:11.880 --> 56:16.680]  They showed up at his house and then proceeded to go down to Genesis after that or it was
[56:16.680 --> 56:21.680]  either the next morning, but like I said, I mean, it really hit home where I mean, just
[56:21.680 --> 56:27.240]  the questioning when I was talking to my fiance about what they think I'm planning on doing
[56:27.240 --> 56:31.080]  and when they know that I'm not going to do it and just makes me kind of nervous and
[56:31.080 --> 56:36.120]  like I said, it gives me a little chill, but it's not going to stop me in any way.
[56:36.120 --> 56:39.520]  Check your car every day when you get in it because they'll plant stuff on you.
[56:39.520 --> 56:45.080]  Some of them always go to events with people, have multiple cameras and somebody outside
[56:45.080 --> 56:49.680]  and just realize that we're dealing with people, whether they're knowingly part of it or not,
[56:49.680 --> 56:52.120]  that our, I mean, the Secret Service knows they have provocateurs.
[56:52.120 --> 56:53.800]  They know the FBI doesn't.
[56:53.800 --> 56:55.960]  It's just, it's all about stopping the First Amendment.
[56:55.960 --> 56:59.200]  Ted, this agent was also scared to come into the office, wasn't he?
[56:59.200 --> 57:03.760]  Yeah, he didn't want to be videotaped and have it up on YouTube.
[57:03.760 --> 57:04.760]  That's what his concern was.
[57:04.760 --> 57:05.760]  Well, let's just be clear.
[57:05.760 --> 57:08.320]  I got cameras on the outside of my office and on the inside.
[57:08.320 --> 57:10.880]  The Secret Service has been here and looked at them twice.
[57:10.880 --> 57:12.320]  We didn't put that on YouTube.
[57:12.320 --> 57:13.920]  We don't want to mess with you.
[57:13.920 --> 57:15.800]  We don't want you messing with us.
[57:15.800 --> 57:20.800]  Get out of the way of our First Amendment and stop obstructing our liberty, stop obstructing
[57:20.800 --> 57:21.800]  the First Amendment.
[57:21.800 --> 57:26.920]  Anthony has good reason to be nervous because they pretty much have surpassed habeas corpus
[57:26.920 --> 57:28.840]  with the Patriot Act.
[57:28.840 --> 57:33.520]  And if they want to hold somebody indefinitely, they can without legal representation.
[57:33.520 --> 57:35.560]  We've got a network of people everywhere.
[57:35.560 --> 57:41.360]  We've got heavy hitters in Hollywood, in Congress, in the highest levels of the music scene.
[57:41.360 --> 57:45.280]  And that's why they're scared of us because we've got Governor Ventura.
[57:45.280 --> 57:47.800]  We've got just, the list goes on and on.
[57:47.800 --> 57:48.800]  Best actress this year.
[57:48.800 --> 57:50.760]  I mean, it's just growing and growing.
[57:50.760 --> 57:51.960]  We are the majority.
[57:51.960 --> 57:55.840]  The cat is out of the bag and it is only going to backfire.
[57:55.840 --> 58:00.640]  I mean, that's why truth rising is so important with the police saying, a camera is a gun
[58:00.640 --> 58:04.520]  and saying, we're going to plant bombs on you and say that you have bombs.
[58:04.520 --> 58:07.600]  We know you don't have bombs, but we're going to plant bombs on you.
[58:07.600 --> 58:08.600]  Okay.
[58:08.600 --> 58:10.560]  And you're going to go to prison for bombs.
[58:10.560 --> 58:11.560]  On tape.
[58:11.560 --> 58:12.560]  On tape.
[58:12.560 --> 58:13.560]  That's how arrogant they are.
[58:13.560 --> 58:15.320]  Folks, you've got to support us.
[58:15.320 --> 58:16.520]  You've got to stand with us.
[58:16.520 --> 58:18.960]  Anthony, give out the Minnesota We Are Change website.
[58:18.960 --> 58:24.600]  It'll be MNChange, like Minnesota, abbreviated MNChange.org.
[58:24.600 --> 58:27.000]  MNChange.org.
[58:27.000 --> 58:28.080]  We got your six, buddy.
[58:28.080 --> 58:29.880]  You got my home number and cell.
[58:29.880 --> 58:31.000]  We stand with you.
[58:31.000 --> 58:32.000]  You stand with us.
[58:32.000 --> 58:33.800]  God bless you, Anthony Asha.
[58:33.800 --> 58:35.480]  God bless you, Ted Anderson.
[58:35.480 --> 58:37.400]  We need everybody's prayers, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:37.400 --> 58:41.320]  We are engaging the New World Order.

[58:47.000 --> 58:51.960]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[58:51.960 --> 58:56.200]  It is a big idea, a New World Order.
[58:56.200 --> 59:01.000]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.160]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[59:03.160 --> 59:06.760]  Could their objective be world domination?
[59:06.760 --> 59:09.920]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[59:09.920 --> 59:14.920]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating
[59:14.920 --> 59:20.280]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[59:20.280 --> 59:25.720]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[59:25.720 --> 59:29.600]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[59:29.600 --> 59:32.280]  Builder Bird is making great progress toward a world government.
[59:32.280 --> 59:33.280]  Most people have no idea.
[59:33.280 --> 59:34.280]  They're not after money.
[59:34.280 --> 59:35.280]  They have all the money they need.
[59:35.280 --> 59:36.280]  They're after power.
[59:36.280 --> 59:37.280]  They're after easy.

[59:45.040 --> 59:54.240]  In-game, blueprint for global enslavement, you have been warned.
[59:54.240 --> 1:00:06.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:10.800]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:00:10.800 --> 1:00:11.800]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:14.000]  Well, so does he.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:18.120]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:00:18.120 --> 1:00:22.040]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:22.040 --> 1:00:26.200]  After the break, I'm going to open the phones up for people that have been watching the
[1:00:26.200 --> 1:00:30.560]  four hours now of the impeachment whitewash kangaroo court hearings.
[1:00:30.560 --> 1:00:34.960]  I wonder if the Secret Service will visit Dennis Kasenich in front and arrest him for
[1:00:34.960 --> 1:00:38.000]  bringing up crime.
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:39.480]  Secret Service has visited this office.
[1:00:39.480 --> 1:00:41.600]  They visited Ted Anderson.
[1:00:41.600 --> 1:00:43.520]  They have visited Anthony Asha.
[1:00:43.520 --> 1:00:44.520]  We are changed.
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:45.520]  You did nothing.
[1:00:45.520 --> 1:00:49.880]  Shane, we have fake press passes to go to events when Genesis has over 200 affiliates,
[1:00:49.880 --> 1:00:52.000]  more than 200 with all of his shows combined.
[1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:53.400]  I've got like 60-something.
[1:00:53.400 --> 1:00:57.320]  Barry Brownfield now is officially carried completely by Genesis.
[1:00:57.320 --> 1:00:58.560]  He's got like 70-something.
[1:00:58.560 --> 1:01:02.840]  I mean, Free Talk Live's got like 40 or something last time I checked.
[1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:03.840]  Bought a big stations.
[1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:06.040]  A bunch of other shows have a ton of affiliates.
[1:01:06.040 --> 1:01:08.760]  I mean, it's got to be over 200.
[1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:10.000]  And oh, we're not media.
[1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:11.000]  We're evil.
[1:01:11.000 --> 1:01:12.560]  Well, this is for you.
[1:01:12.560 --> 1:01:14.360]  Stop violating the Constitution.
[1:01:14.360 --> 1:01:16.840]  Don't go down in history as Hitler's Gestapo.
[1:01:16.840 --> 1:01:17.840]  That's what the SS was.
[1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:22.280]  They were his Secret Service that he had go nationwide under Reich security, translated
[1:01:22.280 --> 1:01:24.920]  to mean land security.
[1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:26.240]  Reich to Germans means homeland.
[1:01:26.240 --> 1:01:27.360]  Look up Reich in German.
[1:01:27.360 --> 1:01:30.680]  Look at what German dictionary online, type German dictionary, type Reich.
[1:01:30.680 --> 1:01:33.680]  Hitler would say, ein Voch, ein Reich, ein Führer.
[1:01:33.680 --> 1:01:37.400]  One land, one people, one leader.
[1:01:37.400 --> 1:01:42.000]  Reich means land.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:48.760]  Ein Voch means one people, ein Reich means one land, ein Führer means one leader.
[1:01:48.760 --> 1:01:50.600]  That is, the Secret Service was the SS.
[1:01:50.600 --> 1:01:55.640]  And notice what its abbreviation is, SS, Secret Service, SS.
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:00.600]  Hitler modeled it off of the Jesuit order and the United States Secret Service.
[1:02:00.600 --> 1:02:03.600]  That's why they even use the same title, SS.
[1:02:03.600 --> 1:02:04.920]  We didn't get it from the Nazis.
[1:02:04.920 --> 1:02:10.680]  They got it from us, SS, Secret Service, Stuhl & Stauffel.
[1:02:10.680 --> 1:02:11.680]  Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:02:11.680 --> 1:02:14.680]  This song is for you, the Secret Service.
[1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:34.680]  So, we folks, the bonds made the way to black, the red, white and blue.
[1:02:34.680 --> 1:02:45.680]  And when the band plays, hell to the chief blood, no, they quake the cannon at you.
[1:02:45.680 --> 1:02:55.680]  Southland, got your name in me, it ain't me, no, I ain't no senator, son.
[1:02:55.680 --> 1:03:05.680]  It ain't me, no, it ain't me, no, I ain't the fortunate one.
[1:03:05.680 --> 1:03:06.680]  Let's go.
[1:03:06.680 --> 1:03:17.680]  Some folks are born, silver spoon in their hand, love, no, they help themselves, don't
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:27.680]  they help themselves, the jacksman give them the key to the land, and when the white has
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:36.680]  nothing left for schooling them, yeah, they ain't me, no, it ain't me, no, I ain't no
[1:03:36.680 --> 1:03:38.680]  millionaire, son.
[1:03:38.680 --> 1:03:48.680]  It ain't me, no, it ain't me, no, I ain't the fortunate one.
[1:03:48.680 --> 1:04:00.680]  Some folks are lost, inherits start playing go live, only to send you off to war.
[1:04:00.680 --> 1:04:10.680]  And when you ask them, how much should you get, they tell you more and more, more and more.
[1:04:10.680 --> 1:04:33.680]  They want more, more, more, take it more, more, more, send it more, more, more, and more,
[1:04:33.680 --> 1:05:03.540]  May I have everybody's attention please?
[1:05:03.680 --> 1:05:06.680]  I've come with a message of information.
[1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:08.680]  9-Eleven was an inside job.
[1:05:08.680 --> 1:05:11.680]  Do you like being a puppet, sir? Do you like being a puppet for the New World Order?
[1:05:11.680 --> 1:05:14.680]  How do the American people know that 9-Eleven was a stage?
[1:05:14.680 --> 1:05:18.680]  Was it engineered by you, David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CIFAR?
[1:05:18.680 --> 1:05:27.680]  The day that we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[1:05:27.680 --> 1:05:32.680]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[1:05:32.680 --> 1:05:37.680]  An inside job? How dare you?
[1:05:37.680 --> 1:05:43.680]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:05:43.680 --> 1:05:46.680]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:05:46.680 --> 1:05:52.680]  And if the government has not told the truth in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-Eleven.
[1:05:52.680 --> 1:05:58.680]  Please rise, download the film at prisonplanet.tv right now, or get the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:05:58.680 --> 1:06:01.680]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[1:06:01.680 --> 1:06:07.680]  High fuel prices for gasoline and diesel are taking a huge bite out of budgets for individuals and businesses.
[1:06:07.680 --> 1:06:09.680]  But there is something you can do.
[1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:16.680]  FuelSaver Incorporated's fuel enhancer formula will not only stretch each gallon of fuel further for mere pennies per treated gallon,

[1:06:24.680 --> 1:06:28.680]  saving you 30 to 80 cents on each gallon of fuel at the pump.

[1:07:21.680 --> 1:07:27.680]  Marty Schachter founded Calben Soap Company in 1947 and provided products for health institutions.
[1:07:27.680 --> 1:07:30.680]  Now Calben Soaps are available to you and me.
[1:07:30.680 --> 1:07:35.680]  Triple concentrated for all your cleaning needs, from bathing and laundry to dishes, hair, and more.

[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:53.680]  Call then Pure Soap at 1-800-340-7091. That's 1-800-340-7091 or log on to 5starsoap.com now for a free catalog.
[1:07:53.680 --> 1:08:13.680]  Again that number 1-800-340-7091 or 5starsoap.com for all your cleaning needs.
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:52.680]  That's the great part about a criminal government. You've got all these little cops who are compartmentalized.
[1:08:52.680 --> 1:08:55.680]  Who get to deny what they're part of.
[1:08:55.680 --> 1:09:02.680]  And they have certainly trained a lot of people how to violate the Bellarites, the Constitution, how to butcher this country and overturn it.
[1:09:02.680 --> 1:09:06.680]  And I for one am sick of it. Okay, I got Barack Obama calling for world government.
[1:09:06.680 --> 1:09:11.680]  You gotta love how they're always saying New World Order this. Bill Clinton, George Bush Sr.
[1:09:11.680 --> 1:09:17.680]  On and on and on. And the New World Order means world government, tyrannical world government. That's his definition.
[1:09:17.680 --> 1:09:25.680]  Hitler called for it. He goes to Germany and calls for it and the media says it doesn't exist.
[1:09:25.680 --> 1:09:29.680]  Remember that. It doesn't exist when we say we don't want it and have North American Union documents
[1:09:29.680 --> 1:09:35.680]  and they're putting in NAFTA highways as they build them. They say it doesn't exist.
[1:09:35.680 --> 1:09:40.680]  They talk to us like we're children. It's like people walking out of your house with TV sets they're stealing
[1:09:40.680 --> 1:09:44.680]  and your computer and your jewelry and your clothes and you say, what are you doing stealing?
[1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:49.680]  They drop that hands up and they say, I'm not taking anything. There's no television set.
[1:09:49.680 --> 1:09:55.680]  I don't exist. I'm not here. You're crazy. And some people are so weak minded they might say, oh, okay.
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:01.680]  You're not here. You walk into your house. Your couch has been loaded in the truck in the big van.
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:05.680]  They're stealing everything and I guess you just sit down on the floor and imagine there's a couch there.
[1:10:05.680 --> 1:10:11.680]  And we got goons running around trying to set people up with our press passes saying they're going to charge them with false documents.
[1:10:11.680 --> 1:10:16.680]  We've got death threats flowing in. We've got all sorts of corruption going on.
[1:10:16.680 --> 1:10:19.680]  We've got them violating the First Amendment everywhere. Secret arrest.
[1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:24.680]  The Bill of Rights overturned. They're about to launch a war on a country that doesn't have any nuclear weapons.
[1:10:24.680 --> 1:10:29.680]  This isn't even close. CIA says seven years. But the media doesn't care. They go, oh, no, it's decades away.
[1:10:29.680 --> 1:10:34.680]  But reality says decades away. But they say, oh, no, they've got it right now.
[1:10:34.680 --> 1:10:39.680]  We've got to hit them right now. Iran's real vicious and threatening to nuke Israel when they're not.
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:48.680]  Meanwhile, Special Forces and Wahhabi al-Qaeda groups admittedly are in Iran for five years bombing, shooting police, blowing up schools.
[1:10:48.680 --> 1:10:54.680]  White House brags about it and says, we're in Iran fighting al-Qaeda when they're using al-Qaeda.
[1:10:54.680 --> 1:11:02.680]  Sunnis, a subgroup of the Sunnis, the Wahhabist, fighting the Shiites opposite group.
[1:11:02.680 --> 1:11:07.680]  They talk to you like you're idiots. It's unbelievable.
[1:11:07.680 --> 1:11:10.680]  Now, I want to hear about the Cassinage hearing. I've been watching some of it, reading articles.
[1:11:10.680 --> 1:11:14.680]  But I want to talk to callers, Islai, Mike, Nolan, and others that have...
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:17.680]  Islai just dropped. Islai, I was going to you.
[1:11:17.680 --> 1:11:21.680]  And we've got a bunch of other callers and other subjects, but you can call them with a line open.
[1:11:21.680 --> 1:11:28.680]  If you specifically have been watching the Cassinage hearings where they stacked the deck with a bunch of other people worshipping Bushing,
[1:11:28.680 --> 1:11:34.680]  he's done nothing wrong. We know Bush is a puppet, but he's been the instrument to carry out all these crimes and false wars and lies.
[1:11:34.680 --> 1:11:39.680]  So let's go to Mike and Florida, Nolan, and others. Mike, you're on the air.
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:42.680]  Go ahead, Mike, you're on the air.
[1:11:42.680 --> 1:11:44.680]  What's going on, Alex?
[1:11:44.680 --> 1:11:47.680]  Well, why broadcast? You say you've been watching the hearings. Give us your takeoff.
[1:11:47.680 --> 1:11:50.680]  I have been. I've been bouncing in and out since you've been coming on.
[1:11:50.680 --> 1:11:52.680]  I've been more or less paying attention to your show.
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:58.680]  There's a lot of passionate supporters that are going on or passionate, you know, people out there really speaking truth.
[1:11:58.680 --> 1:12:04.680]  And what I'm caught up by is the fact that it's not mentioned anywhere on mainstream media at all.
[1:12:04.680 --> 1:12:09.680]  I mean, I was thankful that C-SPAN even put it on. I didn't even think they were going to do that today.
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:18.680]  You know, the fact that now that we have an Obama speech that's being spoken in in France,
[1:12:18.680 --> 1:12:23.680]  that's highlighting over what people are actually saying in this hearing.
[1:12:23.680 --> 1:12:31.680]  The fact that they're pulling out the Constitution, blacking out spots on issues that the Bush administration
[1:12:31.680 --> 1:12:34.680]  has actually canceled out of our Constitution.
[1:12:34.680 --> 1:12:42.680]  And the fact that there's these people on this committee that think that it's ludicrous to be sitting here
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:48.680]  and even considering impeaching Bush. It's crazy, and it's not getting the due process that it wants,
[1:12:48.680 --> 1:12:54.680]  but it is a huge step, and it's very passionate, and I'm so thankful for people like Dennis Kucinich.
[1:12:54.680 --> 1:12:57.680]  The gentleman is in charge of the veterans for peace.
[1:12:57.680 --> 1:13:01.680]  I spoke very, very elegantly. Bob Barr, he's spoken very well.
[1:13:01.680 --> 1:13:09.680]  So good things are happening. I'm upset that it's not being shared more on mainstream.
[1:13:09.680 --> 1:13:17.680]  This is huge news. This is the Judiciary Committee hearing testimony to bring impeachment
[1:13:17.680 --> 1:13:22.680]  before the House of Representatives, and it's not on any of the channels.
[1:13:22.680 --> 1:13:26.680]  We're flipping around. We're checking them. There's a news blackout on this.
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:29.680]  This is unbelievable.
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:35.680]  Additionally, as I'm flipping through CNN and MSNBC and whatnot,
[1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:41.680]  they also have a big story about how there was the airplane that almost went down
[1:13:41.680 --> 1:13:45.680]  due to the same thing that happened with Ron Paul on board, and they're giving out a story,
[1:13:45.680 --> 1:13:50.680]  and I didn't really, I'm not paying attention to mainstream media too much anymore,
[1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:57.680]  but I'm not sure they gave that a highlighting platform as well, but yet I see it doing it.
[1:13:57.680 --> 1:14:02.680]  Well, they're also discussing Barack Obama, the eternal distraction. That's all it is.
[1:14:02.680 --> 1:14:06.680]  Oh, look at our puppet. Look at him. Will he win? Oh, it does he have what it takes?
[1:14:06.680 --> 1:14:10.680]  It doesn't matter. He runs nothing. He is no one.
[1:14:10.680 --> 1:14:15.680]  What's sad is, and I don't want to say what's up to all We Are Change people out there,
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:19.680]  especially We Are Change Florida. Tomorrow we're going to get on it.
[1:14:19.680 --> 1:14:24.680]  I myself, I'm a veteran of the wars.
[1:14:24.680 --> 1:14:29.680]  Truth rising was definitely something that woke me up and got me to get moving,
[1:14:29.680 --> 1:14:34.680]  and I want to thank you for it. I want to thank every member of We Are Change,
[1:14:34.680 --> 1:14:39.680]  especially good old Luke there. I mean, that man's got a, yeah, he's got heart,
[1:14:39.680 --> 1:14:44.680]  and you know, I was an Obama supporter.
[1:14:44.680 --> 1:14:47.680]  I was a big Obama supporter because I wanted the war to end.
[1:14:47.680 --> 1:14:51.680]  I want to change. I wanted it when I first started hearing you say that Obama was this
[1:14:51.680 --> 1:14:54.680]  and Obama was that. It just didn't make sense to me.
[1:14:54.680 --> 1:14:57.680]  And I want to thank you guys so much for the Bilderberg coverage you did,
[1:14:57.680 --> 1:15:02.680]  because that woke me up and I'm an extremely passionate, educated human being
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:06.680]  and one that feels that there's no greater fight in the world than to do this.
[1:15:06.680 --> 1:15:09.680]  And I'm not scared to put my life on the line for it. I've done it before.
[1:15:09.680 --> 1:15:14.680]  And yeah, I don't know what they're doing with Obama. He's not the answer.
[1:15:14.680 --> 1:15:17.680]  Well, I want to say to all the veterans that he's a distraction. It's like McCain.
[1:15:17.680 --> 1:15:22.680]  I want to say to all the veterans, you know, the only difference between McCain
[1:15:22.680 --> 1:15:27.680]  is he's a looks like a colorless chipmunk, as he's been called,
[1:15:27.680 --> 1:15:32.680]  and Obama is more handsome that that is the only difference
[1:15:32.680 --> 1:15:36.680]  and she's younger and better looking and better spoken.
[1:15:36.680 --> 1:15:41.680]  That's the only difference. And all the veterans, you've been brought into false fake wars,
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:44.680]  destroy our treasury, loot our treasury, store our name.
[1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:49.680]  The real fight is here in the homeland, in the Republic, that's being dismantled by enemies, internal.
[1:15:49.680 --> 1:15:53.680]  Many coups have gotten control of central governments and used outside wars
[1:15:53.680 --> 1:15:58.680]  to unify the population around the real target, bringing down the country to the looters.
[1:15:58.680 --> 1:16:03.680]  And we are bringing and brought down. They're talking about Ford and GM mainstream news may collapse in the next two months.
[1:16:03.680 --> 1:16:06.680]  They're saying they basically already are bankrupt.
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:12.680]  Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, that's 55 plus trillion leveraged into the thousands of trillions.
[1:16:12.680 --> 1:16:15.680]  Yes, you heard me, thousands of trillions.
[1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:19.680]  Sperm counts have dropped by more than 85% in the West.
[1:16:19.680 --> 1:16:22.680]  Cancer is exploding thousands and thousands of percentiles.
[1:16:22.680 --> 1:16:30.680]  Juvenile onset of cancer, early onset of Alzheimer's and 25-year-olds from the toxins.
[1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:35.680]  We're being sprayed. We're under chemical, biological attack, every cop, every secret service agent.
[1:16:35.680 --> 1:16:38.680]  Don't roll your eyes. Go find out their testing on us for heaven's sakes.
[1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:40.680]  Find out they engineered the AIDS virus.
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:45.680]  We've read the declassified documents here on air and had medical doctors on and Library of Congress.
[1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:50.680]  You can get these. You're being killed. You're with us. We're under attack here.
[1:16:50.680 --> 1:16:52.680]  Anybody can see what's going on.
[1:16:52.680 --> 1:16:54.680]  And I appreciate your call, sir.
[1:16:54.680 --> 1:16:58.680]  I mean, all the veterans, this is the battle for the Republic right now.
[1:16:58.680 --> 1:17:02.680]  They want to get Americans fighting with each other in another fake election over Republican Democrat.
[1:17:02.680 --> 1:17:04.680]  It means nothing. The deck is stacked.
[1:17:04.680 --> 1:17:06.680]  All the ponies in the race are owned by the same people.
[1:17:06.680 --> 1:17:10.680]  It's like a Don King professional fight.
[1:17:10.680 --> 1:17:14.680]  It's rigged. He owns both the fighters.
[1:17:14.680 --> 1:17:18.680]  It doesn't matter who takes the dive. It doesn't matter what round they go down.
[1:17:18.680 --> 1:17:24.680]  It doesn't matter what happens. It is a staged event.
[1:17:24.680 --> 1:17:28.680]  Period. Things this important, they don't leave up to chance.
[1:17:28.680 --> 1:17:30.680]  They're moving against the web to shut it down.
[1:17:30.680 --> 1:17:32.680]  I got more news on that today. It's all happening.
[1:17:32.680 --> 1:17:37.680]  I've risked my life 110% for this. It isn't a game, people.
[1:17:37.680 --> 1:17:41.680]  That goes for own movement. Get your head screwed on straight.
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:44.680]  You're risking your lives doing this, your treasure, everything.
[1:17:44.680 --> 1:17:48.680]  But you don't have a choice where we're going. It's so bad that it's better to fight
[1:17:48.680 --> 1:17:51.680]  and have no chance of winning. But we do have a chance of winning.
[1:17:51.680 --> 1:17:52.680]  What a church they'll say.
[1:17:52.680 --> 1:17:56.680]  There are times in history to paraphrase when you have a chance to fight early
[1:17:56.680 --> 1:17:57.680]  and you're assured of victory.
[1:17:57.680 --> 1:18:03.680]  And then still there's a worse prospect of fighting when you don't have a very good chance.
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:05.680]  When there's little chance of victory.
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:08.680]  But then there's the final equation. If you wait too long,
[1:18:08.680 --> 1:18:11.680]  you're going to be forced to fight when there is no chance of winning.
[1:18:11.680 --> 1:18:17.680]  But it's better to fight and die on your own two legs instead of in a ditch.
[1:18:17.680 --> 1:18:19.680]  You understand that, ladies and gentlemen?
[1:18:19.680 --> 1:18:21.680]  And we've got a good chance of winning.
[1:18:21.680 --> 1:18:25.680]  We have had courage. We have aggressively exposed the terrorist.
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:27.680]  We have aggressively moved forward against them.
[1:18:27.680 --> 1:18:29.680]  We've exposed so many of their programs.
[1:18:29.680 --> 1:18:32.680]  Congress has a 9% approval rating.
[1:18:32.680 --> 1:18:38.680]  Bush has a lower approval rating by six points than Richard Nixon when he resigned.
[1:18:38.680 --> 1:18:41.680]  Okay? We're winning!
[1:18:41.680 --> 1:18:46.680]  Now some of us have got the tough job of walking point and being shocktrips in this.
[1:18:46.680 --> 1:18:50.680]  Like Anthony Asha and myself and Luke Radowski and many others.
[1:18:50.680 --> 1:18:53.680]  All we're asking is we're going to go through the wall, folks.
[1:18:53.680 --> 1:18:55.680]  We've already gone over the wall.
[1:18:55.680 --> 1:18:58.680]  We're inside the gates trying to open the drawbridge in hand-to-hand
[1:18:58.680 --> 1:19:01.680]  Info War combat with huge hordes of enemies.
[1:19:01.680 --> 1:19:04.680]  We are fighting. We've got the drawbridge halfway down.
[1:19:04.680 --> 1:19:06.680]  Throw grapples on it from across the moat.
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:11.680]  Pull that son of a bitch down right now and start coming over with us!
[1:19:11.680 --> 1:19:15.680]  This is it!
[1:19:15.680 --> 1:19:20.680]  We've got to attack them in the Info War and discredit these murderers now.
[1:19:20.680 --> 1:19:26.680]  And there's a lot of black ops and a lot of government psych warfare experts and people tuning in.
[1:19:26.680 --> 1:19:30.680]  And I just say this, you know in your gut, even if you're dark psychos,
[1:19:30.680 --> 1:19:33.680]  that you're being killed by your masters and you're being abused by your lords.
[1:19:33.680 --> 1:19:38.680]  And you, for your own preservation, should join us against the dark side.
[1:19:38.680 --> 1:19:40.680]  Don't you understand that?
[1:19:40.680 --> 1:19:42.680]  No, you don't. You're of your father, the devil.
[1:19:42.680 --> 1:19:44.680]  So you're going to continue to submit.
[1:19:44.680 --> 1:19:48.680]  Nolan in Texas has been watching the consent and sharing for one right to you after a break.
[1:19:48.680 --> 1:19:50.680]  I'm going to try to get to others more quickly.
[1:19:50.680 --> 1:19:52.680]  1-800-25-99231.
[1:19:52.680 --> 1:19:53.680]  Got a bunch of news.
[1:19:53.680 --> 1:19:55.680]  Barack Obama calling for New World Order.
[1:19:55.680 --> 1:19:58.680]  Just total craziness as everything intensifies.
[1:19:58.680 --> 1:20:00.680]  A mass global quickening.
[1:20:00.680 --> 1:20:04.680]  PrismPlanet.com. Terror Storm, a history of government-sponsored terror.
[1:20:04.680 --> 1:20:06.680]  Loose change, final cut.
[1:20:06.680 --> 1:20:08.680]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:20:08.680 --> 1:20:10.680]  The true story of the Bilderberg Group.
[1:20:10.680 --> 1:20:11.680]  The late great USA.
[1:20:11.680 --> 1:20:13.680]  America, freedom to fascism.
[1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:17.680]  These are just a few of the hundreds of powerful documentary films and books available

[1:20:58.680 --> 1:21:01.680]  Join the info war today.
[1:21:01.680 --> 1:21:05.680]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:21:05.680 --> 1:21:07.680]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us,
[1:21:07.680 --> 1:21:10.680]  it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:21:10.680 --> 1:21:13.680]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million,
[1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:15.680]  the vast majority of the population of the US.
[1:21:15.680 --> 1:21:19.680]  Though the people of the US where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:21:19.680 --> 1:21:23.680]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men and bringing them to justice.
[1:21:23.680 --> 1:21:27.680]  The nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:21:27.680 --> 1:21:31.680]  They are called Illuminati, elite, opponents of the New World Order.
[1:21:31.680 --> 1:21:34.680]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:21:34.680 --> 1:21:37.680]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:21:37.680 --> 1:21:41.680]  Everything they have built over the centuries, the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:44.680]  the power they have established, the poisoning of the masses,
[1:21:44.680 --> 1:21:46.680]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:21:46.680 --> 1:21:50.680]  we will undo through the authority that has now been delegated to us.
[1:21:50.680 --> 1:21:54.680]  Visit our website at unveilingthem.com.
[1:21:54.680 --> 1:21:58.680]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G, them.com.
[1:21:58.680 --> 1:22:00.680]  The message of His Kingdom.
[1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:03.680]  You ever have one of those days where everything goes right?
[1:22:03.680 --> 1:22:06.680]  First, I get the best parking space at work.
[1:22:06.680 --> 1:22:09.680]  Tonight I have a date with a very lovely Rachel
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:12.680]  and today I gave a killer presentation in Sydney.
[1:22:12.680 --> 1:22:16.680]  Finalized the contract in London and demoed our new product in Boston.

[1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:03.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[1:23:03.680 --> 1:23:09.680]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:13.680]  That's right. Gold has been available to be placed in IRA since 1986.
[1:23:13.680 --> 1:23:20.680]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[1:23:20.680 --> 1:23:28.680]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[1:23:28.680 --> 1:23:33.680]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:39.680]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:39.680 --> 1:23:44.680]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[1:23:44.680 --> 1:23:47.680]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:47.680 --> 1:23:49.680]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[1:23:49.680 --> 1:23:53.680]  Call 800-686-2237.
[1:23:53.680 --> 1:24:15.680]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:27.680]  Here we now seem to be a third election in a row, which is going to be really, really close.
[1:24:27.680 --> 1:24:29.680]  That's some of the hearing.
[1:24:29.680 --> 1:24:33.680]  We're getting some max service. We're going to play later in the next hour for you going on,
[1:24:33.680 --> 1:24:39.680]  endless droning by those against going forward with impeachment investigations and those against.
[1:24:39.680 --> 1:24:45.680]  So we will be getting to that. Nolan in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:24:45.680 --> 1:24:54.680]  I called him, Conyers' office, and I was really steamed about that handcuff and percentage.
[1:24:54.680 --> 1:25:00.680]  That's just not all right. I asked if he had read the Constitution, and she seemed to think that he had.
[1:25:00.680 --> 1:25:05.680]  I said, well, why is it that he's got a problem with the First Amendment?
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:10.680]  And she said that he didn't think that Conyers had anything to do with this.
[1:25:10.680 --> 1:25:13.680]  Of course, I can't argue that point.
[1:25:13.680 --> 1:25:16.680]  That's called sandbagging. We have the press releases.
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:19.680]  They did tell Cassin that she couldn't bring up articles of impeachment.
[1:25:19.680 --> 1:25:24.680]  Oh, I'm not saying you're wrong. I feel lied to by them, trust me.
[1:25:24.680 --> 1:25:26.680]  And Lamar Smith, I was just watching him.
[1:25:26.680 --> 1:25:32.680]  He's pointing out how many times the word impeachment has come up in a hearing that is not an impeachment hearing.
[1:25:32.680 --> 1:25:36.680]  Yeah, let's see. Here he is right here. You have to add Franklin Roosevelt to the list,
[1:25:36.680 --> 1:25:40.680]  because there are allegations that he wanted to get us into World War II.
[1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:43.680]  There may be other presidents.
[1:25:43.680 --> 1:25:50.680]  Yeah, that was Smith going to somebody saying that, oh, Bush is FDR. He's wonderful. Everything's fine. Go ahead, sir.
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:54.680]  Well, sir, I've listened to you for five years. I knew things were wrong before.
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:57.680]  I just didn't have the information to put it together.
[1:25:57.680 --> 1:26:02.680]  You gave me the tools to go out and find what I needed to become an educated American
[1:26:02.680 --> 1:26:06.680]  and to quit being a propagandized parrot like the rest of these people.
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:09.680]  They don't want to stop being what they are.
[1:26:09.680 --> 1:26:14.680]  They don't mind having their lives based on life.
[1:26:14.680 --> 1:26:18.680]  Everything they think, say, and do is based on certain things they take for granted,
[1:26:18.680 --> 1:26:21.680]  and these things are what they've been taught in school,
[1:26:21.680 --> 1:26:24.680]  and they don't want their life, their whole paradigm, to shift.
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:30.680]  Well, here's the deal. We're going to lose our good economy and be slaves.
[1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:37.680]  That's the whole point of this, is that America ceases to exist if they're able to convert us into this New World Order globalist system.
[1:26:37.680 --> 1:26:42.680]  And that's what people better realize, is that GM and Ford are about to go bankrupt.
[1:26:42.680 --> 1:26:47.680]  The Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are going under. Folks, I mean, the globalists did this, and we told you they would.
[1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:50.680]  We were right. We warned you.
[1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:56.680]  A whole day in one forum, open three threads, started pounding them with different things,
[1:26:56.680 --> 1:27:04.680]  and out of all of that, out of 60 or 80 people who read that forum, one person came to me with solid questions.
[1:27:04.680 --> 1:27:09.680]  I gave him back references, links to your sites, links to other sites,
[1:27:09.680 --> 1:27:15.680]  and one person seems to have enough curiosity to actually go see if I'm nuts,
[1:27:15.680 --> 1:27:20.680]  which, you know, that's what he accused me of. He said, you're ten full hat, you know, and I told him,
[1:27:20.680 --> 1:27:24.680]  look, you know, I'm coming across clear here, right? I'm not stupid. Listen to me.
[1:27:24.680 --> 1:27:30.680]  Go look. Prove me wrong. Make me wrong. I'd be much happier wrong, but the Bush is a puppet.
[1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:36.680]  I don't really mind that. He's a willful puppet. He's happily a puppet. I mind that.
[1:27:36.680 --> 1:27:43.680]  I finally got mad. The American people are trained not to be angry, not to have any emotion.
[1:27:43.680 --> 1:27:47.680]  They only have emotion when the ball gets hiked until the whistle blows,
[1:27:47.680 --> 1:27:52.680]  and then you have to stop and be all politically correct. I'm sick of all this.
[1:27:52.680 --> 1:28:01.680]  I really thank you for what you're doing. I'm recording these hearings, and I'm very proud that Kucinich has done this,
[1:28:01.680 --> 1:28:07.680]  and I'm very, very comforted that Ron Paul walked away. I'll be listening to you.
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:11.680]  I listen to you every day, and I would like to do something.
[1:28:11.680 --> 1:28:15.680]  I'd like to ask you if you could possibly do this stuff. I know you're very busy,
[1:28:15.680 --> 1:28:20.680]  but on your website, if you could, I try to grasp it, but it's too quick for me.
[1:28:20.680 --> 1:28:25.680]  If you could put up a place where I could come and understand what is Wahabi and Shi'ite
[1:28:25.680 --> 1:28:30.680]  and how those different things work and another spot that explains where communism came from
[1:28:30.680 --> 1:28:35.680]  and some of these people that were transferred here and there and that shows the subterfuge
[1:28:35.680 --> 1:28:39.680]  so that I can send people there and let them learn it, let them see it,
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:41.680]  and let them go prove it or disprove it.
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:49.680]  I know. Okay, well, just type Islam into Google and just go to, there's all sorts of university sites
[1:28:49.680 --> 1:28:55.680]  in other areas, or get a basic book on Islam, the CIA Factbook, they're honest on their own website,
[1:28:55.680 --> 1:29:03.680]  and it'll just explain that right after Muhammad died, it's split into two different groups.
[1:29:03.680 --> 1:29:09.680]  Those that said it should be hereditary, that you had to be related to the Prophet Muhammad
[1:29:09.680 --> 1:29:19.680]  and to his family to be a religious leader, an Imam, and then there was a break-off.
[1:29:19.680 --> 1:29:27.680]  So that's Shi'ite, and at the same time the Sunnis broke off, about 83% of the world's Muslims are Sunni.
[1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:34.680]  That means they believe anybody can be a religious leader, and about 15% are,
[1:29:34.680 --> 1:29:38.680]  and you can debate these numbers, about 50% are Shi'ite, and there's another little bit of subgroup
[1:29:38.680 --> 1:29:41.680]  that's a few percentage points, so that's it.
[1:29:41.680 --> 1:29:46.680]  Iran is Shi'ite, the opposite group from where Al-Qaeda comes from, but the media says Iran is Al-Qaeda,
[1:29:46.680 --> 1:29:48.680]  that's because they know the public doesn't understand.
[1:29:48.680 --> 1:29:51.680]  We'll be right back.
[1:29:51.680 --> 1:29:55.680]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[1:29:55.680 --> 1:29:58.680]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[1:31:01.680 --> 1:31:07.680]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground Sierra,
[1:31:07.680 --> 1:31:10.680]  and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[1:31:10.680 --> 1:31:17.680]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[1:31:17.680 --> 1:31:26.680]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[1:31:26.680 --> 1:31:33.680]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 Truth, as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[1:31:33.680 --> 1:31:36.680]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[1:31:36.680 --> 1:31:42.680]  He takes his hand off, and you hear 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[1:31:42.680 --> 1:31:49.680]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[1:31:49.680 --> 1:31:54.680]  and aggressively spread it worldwide, or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[1:31:54.680 --> 1:32:00.680]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[1:32:00.680 --> 1:32:06.680]  HempUSA.org is now offering free shipping worldwide to better serve our customers.

[1:32:49.680 --> 1:32:52.680]  why does our government not allow this crop to grow in the U.S.?

[1:33:15.680 --> 1:33:23.680]  Classical tyranny is trying to bring down and loot the United States and use it as a continued engine of evil.
[1:33:23.680 --> 1:33:28.680]  Will we let our currency, our treasury, our name be destroyed forever?
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:31.680]  See, the globalist play nations off against each other.
[1:33:31.680 --> 1:33:33.680]  India and China aren't going to come out on top of this.
[1:33:33.680 --> 1:33:36.680]  When they're done bringing down the U.S., they're going to bring them down.
[1:33:36.680 --> 1:33:38.680]  The U.S. imploding will bring down the world economy.
[1:33:38.680 --> 1:33:41.680]  Every expert, every economist agrees with that.
[1:33:41.680 --> 1:33:47.680]  We're taking your calls about the impeachment hearings that are going on that they're saying you can't call impeachment.
[1:33:47.680 --> 1:33:52.680]  Play some clips of that coming up in the next hour. Got a guest, Freeman, coming in the last hour as well.
[1:33:52.680 --> 1:33:57.680]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen, on the 25th day of July, 2008.
[1:33:57.680 --> 1:34:01.680]  By next week I should know something about whether we're going to have a concert with Willie Nelson
[1:34:01.680 --> 1:34:04.680]  and a bunch of other people in Austin, Texas. I'll just leave it at that.
[1:34:04.680 --> 1:34:07.680]  Very exciting things going on. I'm talking to those folks daily.
[1:34:07.680 --> 1:34:11.680]  It's just tough to do it in the next few months and such short notice of big venues.
[1:34:11.680 --> 1:34:13.680]  We'll probably get 40, 50,000 people there, but we'll see what happens.
[1:34:13.680 --> 1:34:17.680]  It looks looking good, but I don't want to cross my fingers and jinx this.
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:22.680]  Let's go to... Who's the first caller here?
[1:34:22.680 --> 1:34:26.680]  Islay? Islay in Florida. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:34:26.680 --> 1:34:28.680]  How's it going, Alex?
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:29.680]  Good. You're on the air.
[1:34:29.680 --> 1:34:31.680]  Good. Thanks.
[1:34:31.680 --> 1:34:33.680]  I've been watching it, and I'll be honest with you, man.
[1:34:33.680 --> 1:34:39.680]  I'm a little bit more positive about some of the things that have been said.
[1:34:39.680 --> 1:34:41.680]  I agree. The White House was putting pressure on him,
[1:34:41.680 --> 1:34:44.680]  and so Conyers was claiming it was going to be controlled,
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:48.680]  but he can't control it, and the other congressmen who are on the Republican side
[1:34:48.680 --> 1:34:51.680]  keep saying, this is not an impeachment hearing. Be quiet, but it's not working.
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:53.680]  Yeah, yeah. No, it's not working at all.
[1:34:53.680 --> 1:34:59.680]  I mean, Vincent Boogalio, he got some great comments, and he got some applause
[1:34:59.680 --> 1:35:04.680]  because of what he said about some of the people in the administration
[1:35:04.680 --> 1:35:08.680]  should be tried for murder, and everybody applauded. I thought that was awesome.
[1:35:08.680 --> 1:35:10.680]  Unbelievable. We've had him on. We're going to have him back on.
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:13.680]  Of course, that was the famous prosecutor of Manson and others.
[1:35:13.680 --> 1:35:17.680]  Yeah, yeah. He was great, and I heard his interview with you.
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:22.680]  But the big issue is, why isn't this on all the TV networks?
[1:35:22.680 --> 1:35:26.680]  This is news, not Barack Obama running around.
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:29.680]  You're right, but you know what? It's going to be.
[1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:31.680]  It's going to be because I think it's going to happen.
[1:35:31.680 --> 1:35:35.680]  I mean, with all of, I've seen the majority of the Democrats
[1:35:35.680 --> 1:35:38.680]  and other people, Bob Barr, made a whole bunch of good points.
[1:35:38.680 --> 1:35:41.680]  I just don't see that they can deny this.
[1:35:41.680 --> 1:35:44.680]  I think it's going to happen. I think it's going to be big news when it does.
[1:35:44.680 --> 1:35:47.680]  I've been watching him on and off all day. Where is Cassinich?
[1:35:47.680 --> 1:35:48.680]  Has he spoken yet?
[1:35:48.680 --> 1:35:55.680]  Yeah, he did. He spoke way early. He spoke like 10, 15-ish, something like that.
[1:35:55.680 --> 1:35:56.680]  Eastern?
[1:35:56.680 --> 1:35:57.680]  Yeah, Eastern time.
[1:35:57.680 --> 1:35:59.680]  Yeah, I got some YouTube clips. We're going to be playing those later.
[1:35:59.680 --> 1:36:03.680]  Yeah, yeah. Now, it was really good, though. Dennis was awesome.
[1:36:03.680 --> 1:36:07.680]  I can't remember all of his statements, just because it was so long ago.
[1:36:07.680 --> 1:36:10.680]  Well, we need a headline on Info Wars by Kurt Nemo.
[1:36:10.680 --> 1:36:13.680]  My great staff working their butts off with something like
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:19.680]  Damn Breaks on Bush Crimes, Committee Loses Control.
[1:36:19.680 --> 1:36:22.680]  That needs to be the headline from just the text I'm reading here of what's been said.
[1:36:22.680 --> 1:36:25.680]  Boogliosi calls him. He says they should be charged for murder.
[1:36:25.680 --> 1:36:27.680]  Yes, the dam is breaking.
[1:36:27.680 --> 1:36:32.680]  It's awesome, man. I love it. And it's because of you and it's because of people like you.
[1:36:32.680 --> 1:36:34.680]  And thank you so much, Alex.
[1:36:34.680 --> 1:36:38.680]  Well, let's watch out. They could go ahead and throw a fit.
[1:36:38.680 --> 1:36:44.680]  When it came out that 1.9 trill, it's now over 4-trill, was stolen from the Pentagon in the Associated Press.
[1:36:44.680 --> 1:36:48.680]  I believe they were planning 9-11 later, but they went ahead and carried it out.
[1:36:48.680 --> 1:36:51.680]  It came out two days before. Two days later, they hit us
[1:36:51.680 --> 1:36:55.680]  because that would have brought them down right there, stealing that trill.9.
[1:36:55.680 --> 1:36:59.680]  And don't roll your eyes, cops. Go Google it.
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:04.680]  But you're so afraid of the tyranny, you won't even Google the missing trillions because you know that's all being tracked.
[1:37:04.680 --> 1:37:06.680]  Unbelievable coward. Is there anything else?
[1:37:06.680 --> 1:37:12.680]  No, Alex. I just want to say thank you so much for what you're doing and for what you've done in the past.
[1:37:12.680 --> 1:37:16.680]  And it's amazing and I think we're going to win.
[1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:20.680]  I think we are too, my brother. God bless you and take care, my friend.
[1:37:20.680 --> 1:37:23.680]  Amazing what's happening. We know we're going to win.
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:25.680]  I mean, if God be with us, who can be against us?
[1:37:25.680 --> 1:37:28.680]  And I don't want to hear all this atheist baloney, but there's not good and evil.
[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:34.680]  There are more things in heaven and earth than in all of your philosophy.
[1:37:34.680 --> 1:37:37.680]  Let's say, Shakespeare quote.
[1:37:37.680 --> 1:37:46.680]  And they rephrase that in Master and Commander when the Jonas throws himself overboard and he says to the good doctor, the ship surgeon,
[1:37:46.680 --> 1:37:51.680]  he says, you know, you don't believe in all this mumbo jumbo, all the superstition.
[1:37:51.680 --> 1:37:56.680]  The captain says, there are more things going on in the world than in all of your books, doctor.
[1:37:56.680 --> 1:37:59.680]  More things going on than just in your books.
[1:37:59.680 --> 1:38:01.680]  It's all about spirit, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:38:01.680 --> 1:38:04.680]  That's what wins battles. That's what builds families.
[1:38:04.680 --> 1:38:08.680]  That's what explores continents. That's what explores oceans.
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:10.680]  It's what sends us into space.
[1:38:10.680 --> 1:38:16.680]  It's what helps us, you know, you get your mind right, you can bench press 400 pounds, you know, only bench press 300.
[1:38:16.680 --> 1:38:23.680]  I mean, it's all about the soul, the driving force that animates our earth suits under these fleshly bodies.
[1:38:23.680 --> 1:38:27.680]  I can't believe the secular world is stolen this from you and giving you the lie.
[1:38:27.680 --> 1:38:30.680]  Let's go ahead. That's why I'm not afraid to die, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:38:30.680 --> 1:38:36.680]  I don't want to die. I want to go on and enjoy this life and enjoy this plane of existence with my children and my wonderful life.
[1:38:36.680 --> 1:38:49.680]  Enjoy the beautiful sky and just the smell of flowers in the field or fresh cut grass to see fish swimming around in the bottom of a clear river or creek or turtles jumping off of rocks.
[1:38:49.680 --> 1:39:03.680]  See a hot air balloon rising on a beautiful Sunday morning over rolling hills to walk through the redwoods and sequoias to look down into a coastal reef in the Caribbean.
[1:39:03.680 --> 1:39:12.680]  To plunge down into the warm water with your mask and snorkel and to interface with that whole other dimension of life on this planet.
[1:39:12.680 --> 1:39:19.680]  There's so much beauty, so much goodness, and I commit myself fully to defense of it against evil and death.
[1:39:19.680 --> 1:39:24.680]  Let's talk to sing an end to you. Sing, you're on the air.
[1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.680]  Yeah, hello.
[1:39:26.680 --> 1:39:28.680]  Yes, sir.
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:30.680]  It's an honor meeting you, Alex.
[1:39:30.680 --> 1:39:33.680]  It's an honor to talk to you, sir.
[1:39:33.680 --> 1:39:42.680]  Hey, I'm basically I watched your first documentary Marshall in 2005. Before that, I thought that Osama Bin Laden was behind 9-11 attacks.
[1:39:42.680 --> 1:39:47.680]  So after that, I just got my, what do you say, red pill.
[1:39:47.680 --> 1:39:56.680]  And I also like wanted to tell you that we also have this National ID card being implemented here in India by 2010.
[1:39:56.680 --> 1:40:08.680]  Yes, globally in the same year, the exact same program names, the same global prefix, universal ID number under you in 3D 2000 signed in Australia.
[1:40:08.680 --> 1:40:16.680]  It is global government. It is going in right now and it is a mass eugenics operation.
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:31.680]  Yeah, and also like day before yesterday, we had a motion of confidence for the parliament. Will the government survive or not? And it was found that the opposition party members have bribed at least $2 million to vote for the ruling party, which is Congress.
[1:40:31.680 --> 1:40:48.680]  So just you can see that they are driving intimidating just to get hold on power for this nuclear deal. I just don't know why it's so important nuclear deal between that station in India and why the government is so desperate to sign this deal.
[1:40:48.680 --> 1:41:03.680]  Yeah, it's corruption and looting and every form of thievery in institutions has just gone to seed. It is like a horrible staff infection of flesh-eating bacteria racing through our body, eating our flesh, and the public has to at least admit.
[1:41:03.680 --> 1:41:13.680]  I mean, even if everybody woke up now, it would be hard to turn it around. Folks, you don't have a hope or a prayer if you don't have the will to stand up against evil.
[1:41:13.680 --> 1:41:22.680]  And look at how the United States, that is the criminals that have hijacked us, gave nukes to Pakistan to menace India. I mean, it's just never ending.
[1:41:22.680 --> 1:41:36.680]  Yeah, and also one more thing I would like to give a website address to you. It's www.ng.com. You may, I think, like it or don't like it, but it's in the lines of David Ike research.
[1:41:36.680 --> 1:41:44.680]  Like it talks about like the Civil War and the independence movement in the United States was actually instigated by the British Empire.
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:55.680]  They wanted to teach a lesson to the colonists. So that's why they had this 1776 revolution was from the British side, not the United States side.
[1:41:55.680 --> 1:42:03.680]  But they failed. Their original plan for New World Order was way back in 1776 to merge this church and the British Empire.
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:12.680]  That's why when they failed, they had this alternative plan known as Industrial Revolution, which had all the technologies and all the stuff, and now we are here.
[1:42:12.680 --> 1:42:16.680]  It's an awesome website. If you do want to read it, please go to the website.
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:22.680]  They're not aware of that. That's good info. They also tried to stage the Civil War. And I'm from the South. I'm not bashing the South.
[1:42:22.680 --> 1:42:26.680]  My family was all on the Confederate side. The point is they meant well, but they were manipulated.
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:38.680]  They tried to have a Civil War when Andrew Jackson was president, but he saw through it and found out that the British intel, the Her Majesty's Secret Service, as they're called, were manipulating the South.
[1:42:38.680 --> 1:42:44.680]  And that definitely happened there, but they failed there as well. Thank you so much for the call from India.
[1:42:44.680 --> 1:42:48.680]  Scott in Arizona, you're on the air worldwide.
[1:42:48.680 --> 1:42:56.680]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to say great job. I'm the one who called the other day and was talking to you and Willie about doing the concert.
[1:42:56.680 --> 1:43:01.680]  I'm glad that it seems to be moving forward. That's a good thing to hear.
[1:43:01.680 --> 1:43:07.680]  Also, repeating what Dennis said on your show that day about calling the media.
[1:43:07.680 --> 1:43:14.680]  Maybe we can get him to do some excerpts from what happened today, even on your local media station. I think that might be cool as well.
[1:43:14.680 --> 1:43:19.680]  But thanks a lot, Alex. I wanted to give you much appreciation for that.
[1:43:19.680 --> 1:43:24.680]  Well, Scott, I'm glad that you called in and said, hey Willie, you ought to have a concert.
[1:43:24.680 --> 1:43:32.680]  I'll tell you this, I really wanted to be free and then get business sponsorship, corporate sponsorship, drive up a giant free event.
[1:43:32.680 --> 1:43:39.680]  But even if it's quote free, we got to pay to get the bands there and pay for their expenses. They'll waive their fees, I'm sure.
[1:43:39.680 --> 1:43:46.680]  But it's going to be big. I think we could have 50,000 people in and around Austin and then have a huge media event out of that.
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:49.680]  It doesn't mean it will save the world, but every little bit helps and this will be a big thing.
[1:43:49.680 --> 1:43:55.680]  So thank you, Scott. I'm going to be talking to Willie tomorrow.
[1:43:55.680 --> 1:43:58.680]  Well, a lot's going on behind the scenes. I'm just going to leave it at that.
[1:43:58.680 --> 1:44:04.680]  But we don't rise or fall on that. It's looking good, but I'm not going to hold my breath because I just can't stand worrying about it.
[1:44:04.680 --> 1:44:08.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to, well, Seth in the UK just hung up.
[1:44:08.680 --> 1:44:11.680]  What's the word in California? You're on the air.
[1:44:11.680 --> 1:44:13.680]  How are you doing, sir? Good.
[1:44:13.680 --> 1:44:20.680]  Okay. I wanted to bring up something that's happening and what people have been seeing and plus one other thing.
[1:44:20.680 --> 1:44:28.680]  Right now, in this war, they're trying to sever our lines of communication amongst each other and that would be the internet.
[1:44:28.680 --> 1:44:37.680]  Yes, they've announced their systematically shutting it down, starting in England, Canada,
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:40.680]  and of course, France starting next month.
[1:44:40.680 --> 1:44:47.680]  Yeah, and I don't think the people are really understanding in our movement and the fringes who are fighting amongst each other
[1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:56.680]  are trying to get it that we need to come together to stop this because without this communication, we won't be able to coordinate our efforts.
[1:44:56.680 --> 1:45:02.680]  Yeah, unfortunately, about a third of the quote movement only critiques other people thinking that will make them the king cheeses.
[1:45:02.680 --> 1:45:07.680]  They have no idea the responsibility, the pressure of actually doing that.
[1:45:07.680 --> 1:45:11.680]  And they never wake anybody up about fluoride or mercury or poisons or wars.
[1:45:11.680 --> 1:45:14.680]  It's just all endlessly whining and bitching about other groups.
[1:45:14.680 --> 1:45:16.680]  And a lot of that's coming to the pro. A lot of it isn't.
[1:45:16.680 --> 1:45:18.680]  But we just have to ignore those people.
[1:45:18.680 --> 1:45:23.680]  I wouldn't even engage them for those that aren't wicked who are just deceived.
[1:45:23.680 --> 1:45:27.680]  We can try to wake them up and reach out to them, pray that they have their eyes opened.
[1:45:27.680 --> 1:45:31.680]  But really, we don't have time for that.
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:32.680]  Sure, go ahead.
[1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:36.680]  Yeah, and that's absolutely right because we need to grow our numbers.
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:41.680]  And because there's many people who are just waking up now and they're still sort of unprepared.
[1:45:41.680 --> 1:45:44.680]  Yeah, there's brand new people by the millions coming online every day.
[1:45:44.680 --> 1:45:49.680]  And then a third of our movement just bitches and gripes and says, this person's bad, that person's bad.
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:52.680]  And whines about exactly who runs it or the exact.
[1:45:52.680 --> 1:45:54.680]  I mean, we know it's a global government.
[1:45:54.680 --> 1:45:57.680]  It's got every major group under its control in government and religion.
[1:45:57.680 --> 1:46:00.680]  It's moving against us. It's carrying out eugenics against us.
[1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:02.680]  We know we have to stop it.
[1:46:02.680 --> 1:46:04.680]  I mean, it's really that simple.
[1:46:04.680 --> 1:46:05.680]  Yeah.
[1:46:05.680 --> 1:46:15.680]  And the other thing is to make a clarification about a story that was being put forth by you and others about how they're blocking out California driver's license.
[1:46:15.680 --> 1:46:20.680]  Basically, how the system works and how it's instituted besides beyond police officers.
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:25.680]  We had a few incidents with some social workers and supervisors were attacked.
[1:46:25.680 --> 1:46:27.680]  So they went before the legislation.
[1:46:27.680 --> 1:46:33.680]  And I know there's another lady who's trying to put forth that it's going to go to dog catchers and everybody else.
[1:46:33.680 --> 1:46:38.680]  But as the numbers grow with this blocked license, it's your private license.
[1:46:38.680 --> 1:46:44.680]  Basically, your private vehicle, which is blocked from being reviewed by anybody who pulls you over.
[1:46:44.680 --> 1:46:50.680]  But that doesn't stop police officers as yet from pulling people over because we know we've had a few.
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:57.680]  Yeah. But for those that don't know what you're talking about, it said nine hundred and ninety four thousand people as of last year.
[1:46:57.680 --> 1:47:02.680]  The numbers are always a year old and it's growing by hundreds of thousands a year in California.
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:04.680]  Can't get red light tickets.
[1:47:04.680 --> 1:47:06.680]  The cops basically let them go.
[1:47:06.680 --> 1:47:09.680]  And it's a form of being above the law.
[1:47:09.680 --> 1:47:10.680]  I understand.
[1:47:10.680 --> 1:47:12.680]  I'm all for people having their privacy.
[1:47:12.680 --> 1:47:18.680]  The problem is that it is now becoming an elite class and it's being abused.
[1:47:18.680 --> 1:47:20.680]  Well, that's the thing.
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:26.680]  And as this goes on, the police, the people if they're bought out, are going to disregard that.
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:28.680]  They're just going to be pulling them over.
[1:47:28.680 --> 1:47:33.680]  Now, as far as the red light or parking tickets, what happens is that license is blocked.
[1:47:33.680 --> 1:47:36.680]  So they're unable to pull up the information.
[1:47:36.680 --> 1:47:41.680]  If you travel to other states, I'm not sure if they can pull you over or pull up that information.
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:45.680]  But this is a form that can be abused and probably will be.
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:52.680]  And probably what they'll do is they'll start facing it out again back down to just probably police officers or government officials.
[1:47:52.680 --> 1:47:54.680]  I hear you. I appreciate your call.
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:56.680]  Let's go ahead.
[1:47:56.680 --> 1:47:57.680]  I mean, I'm against it.
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:02.680]  I think people, you know, in my life, I don't get any special breaks and I'm a media figure.
[1:48:02.680 --> 1:48:04.680]  And people, that's why you should be armed.
[1:48:04.680 --> 1:48:06.680]  And that's why we should all know how to fight.
[1:48:06.680 --> 1:48:10.680]  And, you know, people come after you, stand up for yourself against them.
[1:48:10.680 --> 1:48:14.680]  Now, I know that's why CPS and others, and I know that's not all social workers.
[1:48:14.680 --> 1:48:18.680]  But that's why they pick on nice Christian families because they can kidnap their kids and be left alone.
[1:48:18.680 --> 1:48:19.680]  Then they leave.
[1:48:19.680 --> 1:48:24.680]  Criminals are beating their children with tire irons alone because they're scared of them.
[1:48:24.680 --> 1:48:27.680]  That's what the revenue-generating cops do now.
[1:48:27.680 --> 1:48:32.680]  They leave the hardcore crooks and the Los Zetas and MS-13 alone and then feed on the American people.
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:35.680]  And I've had enough of it.
[1:48:35.680 --> 1:48:39.680]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brett in Florida.
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:41.680]  You're on the air. Go ahead, Brett.
[1:48:41.680 --> 1:48:43.680]  Hey, Alex. This is Brent. How are you doing today?
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:44.680]  Good.
[1:48:44.680 --> 1:48:48.680]  Just want to let you know, I'm an ex-member of Naval Special Forces,
[1:48:48.680 --> 1:48:52.680]  been involved in the Patriot movement since I got out in 91.
[1:48:52.680 --> 1:48:55.680]  I've been listening to your show for the past year or so,
[1:48:55.680 --> 1:48:58.680]  and I'm just absolutely blown away by the response that you guys get.
[1:48:58.680 --> 1:49:00.680]  You're absolutely doing a great job.
[1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:01.680]  Thank you.
[1:49:01.680 --> 1:49:09.680]  What I'd like to do is let all these wonderful people out there know that I've been in the past militias and all that stuff.
[1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:13.680]  It's not about the guns, man. It's time to drop those weapons, bury them, actually,
[1:49:13.680 --> 1:49:19.680]  and pick up cameras, bull horns, and the Internet while we still have time,
[1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:22.680]  and get the word out that a lot of nasty stuff's going on.
[1:49:22.680 --> 1:49:26.680]  Everything from fluoride to vaccines, I agree with you, 100%.
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:31.680]  The whole reason COINTELPRO works is because they can divide us.
[1:49:31.680 --> 1:49:36.680]  There are so many issues to be divided upon that it's stupid.
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:45.680]  And they're succeeding when they can divide us on information of the politics, you know, Barack or McCain.
[1:49:45.680 --> 1:49:48.680]  It doesn't matter. It's all predetermined.
[1:49:48.680 --> 1:49:51.680]  Yeah, that's a big projection, so we never see the man behind the curtain.
[1:49:51.680 --> 1:49:57.680]  We need to get way past that and say, no world government, no Iran attack, no cashless society.
[1:49:57.680 --> 1:50:00.680]  I mean, they're passing a law where CPS will visit everyone's home.
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.680]  I mean, I told you, folks, it's all coming down.
[1:50:04.680 --> 1:50:07.680]  It definitely is, and, you know, I've got a lot to worry about.
[1:50:07.680 --> 1:50:10.680]  I've got a big family. I've got four great kids. We all home school.
[1:50:10.680 --> 1:50:15.680]  My wife, you know, God bless her. She's new to the movement, the Patriot movement.
[1:50:15.680 --> 1:50:21.680]  She had her awakening about a month or so ago, and she's just blown away by how much wool has been pulled over
[1:50:21.680 --> 1:50:26.680]  the Americans' eyes on everything from TV to politics to religion.
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:28.680]  You know, I don't want to jump into the wall.
[1:50:28.680 --> 1:50:33.680]  So even though you were awake, your wife was still kind of like, oh, you know, my husband's a little goofy,
[1:50:33.680 --> 1:50:36.680]  but now, I mean, what woke her up? I want to hear about this when we get back, okay?
[1:50:36.680 --> 1:50:37.680]  Yeah.
[1:50:37.680 --> 1:50:39.680]  Stay there, Brett.
[1:50:39.680 --> 1:50:42.680]  Brent, I don't know. The point is, we'll be right back after this quick break.
[1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:46.680]  A ton of news I'm going to cover. I haven't even got into Barack Obama calling for world government,
[1:50:46.680 --> 1:50:51.680]  and it isn't about Barack Obama, and I don't like him because he's black or no.
[1:50:51.680 --> 1:50:55.680]  It's about the fact that he has said he is with the New World Order gang,
[1:50:55.680 --> 1:50:58.680]  as if we didn't know that. Now he's declared it in front of everybody.
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:02.680]  Question.
[1:51:02.680 --> 1:51:06.680]  Is the world getting better or vastly worse?
[1:51:06.680 --> 1:51:11.680]  A world economic collapse could come any day.
[1:51:11.680 --> 1:51:16.680]  Question. Are you prepared or are you ignoring the signs?
[1:51:16.680 --> 1:51:22.680]  Question. Do you have seven years of healthy food for your family?

[1:52:01.680 --> 1:52:06.680]  Do you still think that $4 a gallon at the gas pump is your worst problem in this country?
[1:52:06.680 --> 1:52:12.680]  Bank failures, rising food prices, and an ever-weakening dollar are only the beginning of a much larger crisis.
[1:52:12.680 --> 1:52:18.680]  Why have America's politicians abandoned the rule of law in favor of the rule of men?
[1:52:18.680 --> 1:52:26.680]  The majority of this nation's elected officials have become drunk on the power and illusion of authority that only lawless men and women seek.
[1:52:26.680 --> 1:52:33.680]  They no longer strive to protect American ideals, but rather they have abandoned the very rulebook that they have sworn an oath to defend.
[1:52:33.680 --> 1:52:36.680]  Will the American people let these crimes go unpunished?
[1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:40.680]  Do the American people even understand the crimes that have been committed?
[1:52:40.680 --> 1:52:42.680]  Where does it stop?

[1:54:00.680 --> 1:54:25.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:54:25.680 --> 1:54:35.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:45.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:54:45.680 --> 1:55:05.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:55:05.680 --> 1:55:33.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:55:33.680 --> 1:55:43.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:55:43.680 --> 1:55:53.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:55:53.680 --> 1:56:03.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:31.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:56:31.680 --> 1:56:51.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:56:51.680 --> 1:57:11.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:57:11.680 --> 1:57:39.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:57:39.680 --> 1:57:59.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:57:59.680 --> 1:58:19.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:58:19.680 --> 1:58:39.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:58:39.680 --> 1:58:59.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:58:59.680 --> 1:59:27.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:59:27.680 --> 1:59:37.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:59:37.680 --> 1:59:53.680]  I was sitting in traffic listening to the radio.
[1:59:53.680 --> 2:00:05.680]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.680 --> 2:00:13.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[2:00:13.680 --> 2:00:23.680]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:23.680 --> 2:00:28.680]  Victory or death against the New World Order, they've told us they're giving us no quarter.
[2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:33.680]  They are killing us, everyone, with cancer, viruses, chemical weapons.
[2:00:33.680 --> 2:00:38.680]  Bastards are hitting us everywhere. Morier calls straight ahead.
[2:00:38.680 --> 2:00:44.680]  We're talking to Brett in Florida, and we're talking to Troy, many, many others.
[2:00:44.680 --> 2:00:49.680]  I'm going to get into Barack Obama calling for a New World Order. Big news, just showing you.
[2:00:49.680 --> 2:00:54.680]  He's a very same person. He's letting the world know. I'm a puppet. I serve the New World Order.
[2:00:54.680 --> 2:00:59.680]  I serve the power structure. Disgusting. We already knew it, but now a lot of you can wake up.
[2:00:59.680 --> 2:01:05.680]  Going back to the caller in Florida, sir, tell us about some of the things that woke you up that you saw in Desert Storm.
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:12.680]  One of the major things is that I would say around November of, what was it, 1991?
[2:01:12.680 --> 2:01:19.680]  No, 1990. The presidential backing for the war was kind of low at that time.
[2:01:19.680 --> 2:01:26.680]  He was having a hard time getting the hate to say this, but the tree-hugging left involved getting any support
[2:01:26.680 --> 2:01:32.680]  for continuing anything on over there. And granted, it was a short and fast war, but he needed the political support.
[2:01:32.680 --> 2:01:41.680]  The next thing you know, orders were coming down to take out a bunch of oil fields, oil wells, oil pumping stations.
[2:01:41.680 --> 2:01:50.680]  And if you remember, sadly to say, that was one of the worst natural disasters in world history when the oil just flooded the Gulf.
[2:01:50.680 --> 2:01:52.680]  I'm sure we all saw the pictures.
[2:01:52.680 --> 2:01:57.680]  And I had a lot of special forces tell me who really did that. Who really blew up the oil fields? Was it Saddam?
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:02.680]  No. Not at all.
[2:02:02.680 --> 2:02:03.680]  And were you part of that?
[2:02:03.680 --> 2:02:05.680]  No comment.
[2:02:05.680 --> 2:02:09.680]  And I was told they used Navy SEALs and Delta.
[2:02:09.680 --> 2:02:12.680]  Yeah.
[2:02:12.680 --> 2:02:14.680]  No comment. You understand.
[2:02:14.680 --> 2:02:16.680]  Yeah.
[2:02:16.680 --> 2:02:22.680]  And the next thing we know, you know, we're getting flown off back to our base in Riyadh.
[2:02:22.680 --> 2:02:27.680]  And, you know, cases got to sit in there.
[2:02:27.680 --> 2:02:33.680]  Believe it or not, in a Muslim country, a case of Scotch is sitting there, waiting for us.
[2:02:33.680 --> 2:02:39.680]  So, you know, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck.
[2:02:39.680 --> 2:02:42.680]  It's not hard to draw the pieces, but put the pieces of the puzzle together.
[2:02:42.680 --> 2:02:49.680]  Well, it's the same crew that said that Saddam was throwing babies out of incubators and it turned out it was a New York PR firm completely made up.
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:50.680]  And that's now admitted too.
[2:02:50.680 --> 2:03:11.680]  Now, go from cases of Scotch today to the $30,000 to privates a year, hundreds of thousands of sergeants, huge pallets, billions of dollars a month, and cash pallets being handed out to everyone to where they're so corrupt, toilets are overflowing, airplanes are falling apart, cockroaches all over the veteran centers, and it's just all disintegrating.
[2:03:11.680 --> 2:03:24.680]  Sad, but true, the infrastructure of the military is no longer the way it used to be. I wouldn't, if I'd been asked to re-up and go back in, but I refuse to because I'm not, you know, given up to the...
[2:03:24.680 --> 2:03:27.680]  You asked the question, what are you going to do in a year or two when the CPS comes to your door?
[2:03:27.680 --> 2:03:32.680]  They're going to come to all Americans' doors and say, we got to do your monthly inspection of your children in your house.
[2:03:32.680 --> 2:03:35.680]  No warrant. All Americans get visits.
[2:03:35.680 --> 2:03:38.680]  They have no jurisdiction in my household.
[2:03:38.680 --> 2:03:42.680]  Once they enter the threshold, they have jurisdiction. You do not let them in.
[2:03:42.680 --> 2:03:50.680]  No, I understand, but then they're going to understand that the new phase is, that was previous, you're right, and it's illegal, but they're going to do it. Then they're going to send the SWAT team.
[2:03:50.680 --> 2:03:57.680]  Well, you can't do much about the shock and awe of SWAT. I've been in, I've experienced that firsthand myself.
[2:03:57.680 --> 2:04:07.680]  I was a victim of COINTELPRO after I got out because I happened to let a few little bits of information out about what they were doing in the Patriot movement.
[2:04:07.680 --> 2:04:12.680]  That's just how it is. Everybody gets their visit from the child grabbers. Everyone gets interviewed.
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:16.680]  Again, guilt into proven innocent, total Soviet Union, totally East Germany.
[2:04:16.680 --> 2:04:19.680]  In fact, in the Soviet Union, it wasn't even that bad where you all get your visit.
[2:04:19.680 --> 2:04:25.680]  You get your environmental visit, your child visit. They're in your life. They run your life. It's here, folks.
[2:04:25.680 --> 2:04:33.680]  The total control grid, hell on earth, just tyranny to the power of 10 in your face.
[2:04:33.680 --> 2:04:38.680]  Yes, sir. I mean, it's leaked out. It's come out that they blew the oil wells up for that.
[2:04:38.680 --> 2:04:45.680]  Look at what a Sodom did. But, of course, said he didn't do it. Of course, he was former CIA commando. See what he got.
[2:04:45.680 --> 2:04:48.680]  But I appreciate you coming on the show, sir.
[2:04:48.680 --> 2:04:54.680]  Thank you, Alex. I appreciate it. Just pick up the cameras and drop the guns. That's how we beat them.
[2:04:54.680 --> 2:05:01.680]  Yes, certainly in the Info War. Roll your eye back. Stay with us more on your phone calls and the Morocco Bombinous.
[2:05:01.680 --> 2:05:07.680]  Our beloved Republic is on her knees. The forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty worldwide.
[2:05:07.680 --> 2:05:12.680]  But in Liberty's darkest hour, there is hope. The first time in modern history, the people are beginning to wake up.
[2:05:12.680 --> 2:05:18.680]  It is essential that patriots worldwide accelerate their fellow man's understanding of the New World Order master plan.
[2:05:18.680 --> 2:05:22.680]  We have a short time frame to fully awaken and energize the people to meet this threat.

[2:06:02.680 --> 2:06:10.680]  Even terrible gas prices don't come close to the disaster of food costs from shortages already destroying millions of American families.
[2:06:10.680 --> 2:06:14.680]  Wheat for flour is already four times more expensive than it was about a year ago.
[2:06:14.680 --> 2:06:18.680]  Food costs continue to double because there's no food worldwide.

[2:07:01.680 --> 2:07:07.680]  When I learned that the accumulation of acidic waste was the likely cause of my painful joints, lack of energy, and weight gain,
[2:07:07.680 --> 2:07:11.680]  I knew I would have to change to a more alkaline diet, but it just seems so difficult.
[2:07:11.680 --> 2:07:16.680]  Then a friend suggested I try a Jupiter water ionizer from SnyderHealth.com
[2:07:16.680 --> 2:07:21.680]  and detox my body even before I changed my diet by drinking alkaline ionized water.
[2:07:21.680 --> 2:07:24.680]  Drinking water? No, that's something I can handle.
[2:07:24.680 --> 2:07:30.680]  The guys at SnyderHealth took the time to explain all of the different options and helped me choose the ionizer that was right for me.
[2:07:30.680 --> 2:07:35.680]  I use my new Jupiter ionizer for everything, for drinking, for cooking, and since I've been drinking the water,
[2:07:35.680 --> 2:07:42.680]  I have more energy, my joint pains are gone, and I already lost 7 pounds, and my skin looks great.

[2:08:25.680 --> 2:08:29.680]  For people who play some other clips throughout the show, we do have getting into more of the esoteric area.
[2:08:29.680 --> 2:08:34.680]  I set this interview up last week before I didn't put together with this hearing that was coming up,
[2:08:34.680 --> 2:08:39.680]  so Freeman will be back in the studio with us getting into some of the mindset of what makes the New World War tick
[2:08:39.680 --> 2:08:44.680]  and their secret gang language that's all around us, their symbols, the rest of it.
[2:08:44.680 --> 2:08:47.680]  But right now, let's get into Barack Obama.
[2:08:47.680 --> 2:08:54.680]  Now, somebody put this Sky News, this is Fox News in England, clip together and put a little Imperial Battle March under it.
[2:08:54.680 --> 2:08:57.680]  But other than that, this clip is unedited.
[2:08:57.680 --> 2:09:02.680]  We also have a CNN clip up on infoworks.com, a longer clip of Barack Obama's speech.
[2:09:02.680 --> 2:09:07.680]  But here it is, calling for a New World Order.
[2:09:07.680 --> 2:09:13.680]  This is Sky News with Paula Middlehurst.
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:19.680]  Well, there have been extraordinary scenes in Berlin tonight as thousands of people gathered to hear Barack Obama deliver key
[2:09:19.680 --> 2:09:22.680]  foreign policy speech on his current European tour.
[2:09:22.680 --> 2:09:28.680]  The Democratic presidential hopeful laid out his vision for America's place in a New World Order,
[2:09:28.680 --> 2:09:33.680]  saying he was speaking as a proud citizen of the United States and a fellow citizen of the world.
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:38.680]  While Senator Obama's tackled America's place in the world at several points in his speech,
[2:09:38.680 --> 2:09:44.680]  acknowledging recent splits between the US and the rest of the international community.
[2:09:44.680 --> 2:09:49.680]  In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world,
[2:09:49.680 --> 2:09:55.680]  rather than a force to help us make it right, has become all too common.
[2:09:55.680 --> 2:10:00.680]  Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe.
[2:10:00.680 --> 2:10:03.680]  No doubt there will be differences in the future.
[2:10:03.680 --> 2:10:09.680]  But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together.
[2:10:09.680 --> 2:10:13.680]  A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden.
[2:10:13.680 --> 2:10:21.680]  In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more, not less.
[2:10:21.680 --> 2:10:26.680]  Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice.
[2:10:26.680 --> 2:10:35.680]  This is the only way, the one way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity.
[2:10:45.680 --> 2:10:50.680]  And just in case you forgot about it, here is Gordon Brown, one of many clips
[2:10:50.680 --> 2:10:53.680]  calling for a New World Order three times in a row.
[2:10:53.680 --> 2:10:57.680]  This is the British Prime Minister calling for world government.
[2:10:57.680 --> 2:11:02.680]  All these new challenges are bringing together about the biggest restructuring
[2:11:02.680 --> 2:11:07.680]  we have ever seen, not just of the global economy, but of the global order as a whole.
[2:11:07.680 --> 2:11:12.680]  And 200 years ago, a famous British foreign secretary said that the new world
[2:11:12.680 --> 2:11:16.680]  had been called into existence to redress the balance of the old.
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:23.680]  In 1990, another old world ended, dominated by the Cold War, and people talked then
[2:11:23.680 --> 2:11:26.680]  in 1990 of a New World Order.
[2:11:26.680 --> 2:11:29.680]  What they actually meant then was a new political order.
[2:11:29.680 --> 2:11:34.680]  And what was not foreseen then, but is obvious now from everything that we see and do,
[2:11:34.680 --> 2:11:41.680]  what we experience in every day of our life, is the sheer scale and speed and scope of globalization.
[2:11:41.680 --> 2:11:47.680]  And it's only now that we can begin to understand that the world order that globalization brings
[2:11:47.680 --> 2:11:52.680]  and what it's going to look like, it's driven forward now, not just by the balance of military strength,
[2:11:52.680 --> 2:11:55.680]  the Cold War times, or ordinary political power.
[2:11:55.680 --> 2:12:01.680]  It's being driven forward by a seismic shift in economic power that we see around us.
[2:12:01.680 --> 2:12:07.680]  But what does the New World Order mean for countries like ours who are looking to succeed?
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:12.680]  I suggest that the countries that are going to succeed are those that combine flexibility,
[2:12:12.680 --> 2:12:17.680]  free trade, open markets, with proper stewardship of the environment,
[2:12:17.680 --> 2:12:22.680]  and investment in education, infrastructure, and innovation.
[2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:26.680]  And the question for us is how we meet and master all these challenges
[2:12:26.680 --> 2:12:30.680]  to ensure that Britain enhances its competitiveness in the process
[2:12:30.680 --> 2:12:36.680]  and realizes what I believe is our destiny of success in this new world order.
[2:12:36.680 --> 2:12:40.680]  He actually says it more than that. I'm not going to play the rustle, but it goes on and on.
[2:12:40.680 --> 2:12:45.680]  When you hear education, that means brainwashing, poisoning, sterilization.
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:47.680]  This is what they're doing to you.
[2:12:47.680 --> 2:12:51.680]  And a lot of people are too cowardly to admit that this is happening.
[2:12:51.680 --> 2:12:58.680]  I want to go back and play the Barack Obama Newsnight Sky Television news piece again.
[2:12:58.680 --> 2:13:01.680]  Here's that one more time for those of you that missed it.
[2:13:01.680 --> 2:13:07.680]  This is Sky News with Paula Middlehurst.
[2:13:07.680 --> 2:13:11.680]  Well, there have been extraordinary scenes in Berlin tonight as thousands of people
[2:13:11.680 --> 2:13:17.680]  gathered to hear Barack Obama deliver key foreign policy speech on his current European tour.
[2:13:17.680 --> 2:13:22.680]  The Democratic presidential hopeful laid out his vision for America's place in a new world order,
[2:13:22.680 --> 2:13:27.680]  saying he was speaking as a proud citizen of the United States and a fellow citizen of the world.
[2:13:27.680 --> 2:13:32.680]  Well, Senator Obama's tackled America's place in the world at several points in his speech,
[2:13:32.680 --> 2:13:37.680]  acknowledging recent splits between the US and the rest of the international community.
[2:13:37.680 --> 2:13:43.680]  In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world,
[2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:48.680]  rather than a force to help us make it right, has become all too common.
[2:13:48.680 --> 2:13:53.680]  Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe.
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:57.680]  No doubt there will be differences in the future.
[2:13:57.680 --> 2:14:03.680]  But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together.
[2:14:03.680 --> 2:14:07.680]  A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden.
[2:14:07.680 --> 2:14:15.680]  In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more, not less.
[2:14:15.680 --> 2:14:23.680]  Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice. It is the only way.
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:32.680]  The one way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity.
[2:14:32.680 --> 2:14:39.680]  Did you hear that? You don't have a choice. You must sacrifice. You must give.
[2:14:39.680 --> 2:14:45.680]  You must do what they say. You don't have a choice in the New World Order. It is the only way.
[2:14:45.680 --> 2:14:51.680]  It is the only system you must give up your sovereignty and your due process
[2:14:51.680 --> 2:14:56.680]  and let a bunch of private banks sell you carbon credits on breathing.
[2:14:56.680 --> 2:15:02.680]  We love you. Drink your fluoride. Take your shots. Eat your GMO food.
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:09.680]  Never mind the kids all over your neighborhood dying of cancer and people 25 dying of it all around us.
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:13.680]  Never mind lung cancer up sevenfold in the last 10 years.
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:18.680]  People that don't even smoke, never mind 1 in 33 having cancer down to 1 in 3.
[2:15:18.680 --> 2:15:22.680]  Never mind from 1 in thousands getting diabetes 50 years ago to 1 in 3.
[2:15:22.680 --> 2:15:26.680]  Never mind all the crises and people being sterile.
[2:15:26.680 --> 2:15:30.680]  Never mind all of it. The government loves you. It's got more for you.
[2:15:30.680 --> 2:15:34.680]  It's going to help you. It's going to tax you and regulate you and run your life.
[2:15:34.680 --> 2:15:38.680]  I'm Barack Obama. I'm going to save you.
[2:15:38.680 --> 2:15:42.680]  Oh, I'm going to save you from the evil McCain.
[2:15:42.680 --> 2:15:48.680]  Oh, and then meanwhile it's all the same agenda. It's all the same system.
[2:15:48.680 --> 2:15:52.680]  Oh, God help us. I just can't believe it. I have such a good life. Great family.
[2:15:52.680 --> 2:15:54.680]  I don't want all this to be happening either.
[2:15:54.680 --> 2:15:57.680]  I'm not glad that everything I said was going to happen is happening.
[2:15:57.680 --> 2:16:00.680]  I was just following the globalist own admissions, their own documents.
[2:16:00.680 --> 2:16:04.680]  I wish they would have failed earlier, but they're not.
[2:16:04.680 --> 2:16:11.680]  They're smoking. They're on fire. They're damaged, but they are still moving forward with just that massive weight behind them
[2:16:11.680 --> 2:16:16.680]  and all the funds of the central banks of the planet.
[2:16:16.680 --> 2:16:28.680]  Let's go ahead and go to Troy in Portland, Oregon. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:16:28.680 --> 2:16:31.680]  Hey, Alex. How are you doing, brother? Good.
[2:16:31.680 --> 2:16:34.680]  Good. Hey, back to the C-SPAN stuff that's going on right now.
[2:16:34.680 --> 2:16:39.680]  I wondered if you had a clue as to one, Jeremy Rabkin. Have you ever heard of that guy?
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:41.680]  It rings a bell. Who is it?
[2:16:41.680 --> 2:16:46.680]  Jeremy Rabkin. I've never seen him before. I just saw him testify in there today.
[2:16:46.680 --> 2:16:55.680]  He was all over the place. He's talking about conspiracy theory and saying demented and saying crazy and bringing forth the idea that
[2:16:55.680 --> 2:17:01.680]  if you believe that a president would be that evil and talking to just the general nonsense.
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:05.680]  We have. We have the White House members saying torture children.
[2:17:05.680 --> 2:17:10.680]  We have them lying and saying, we know there's no WMDs. We're going to lie and say there are.
[2:17:10.680 --> 2:17:16.680]  I mean, it's all public. But again, it's the same tactic. Talking to the public like they're idiots.
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:19.680]  Telling us that there's no New World Order.
[2:17:19.680 --> 2:17:23.680]  Yeah, that's incredible. Clip, you just played a rock of bar. I hadn't heard that yet.
[2:17:23.680 --> 2:17:28.680]  And that's just blatant. There's nothing else to say but just that.
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.680]  So no news on Jeremy Rabkin, though. You don't know anything about that guy.
[2:17:32.680 --> 2:17:37.680]  Well, I can Google him what I'm doing right now. Jeremy Rabkin.
[2:17:37.680 --> 2:17:40.680]  R-A-B-R-A-B-K.
[2:17:40.680 --> 2:17:44.680]  Hold on, hold on, hold on. Jeremy, R-A-B.
[2:17:44.680 --> 2:17:46.680]  K-I-N.
[2:17:46.680 --> 2:17:48.680]  K-I-N.
[2:17:48.680 --> 2:17:52.680]  You just look like a dead giveaway to the N-W-O scum to me.
[2:17:52.680 --> 2:17:58.680]  Well, I mean, he's talking books by Jeremy Rabkin, a case for sovereignty. Why? Why the world should.
[2:17:58.680 --> 2:18:04.680]  Law without nations. So it's one of these constitutional quote scholars for the neocons.
[2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:07.680]  I guess putting out a spin. Let's look.
[2:18:07.680 --> 2:18:13.680]  Professor of Law at Harvard. Oh, yeah, I saw him during the hearings.
[2:18:13.680 --> 2:18:18.680]  National Security War on Terror. That's he's, so he's a police state guy.
[2:18:18.680 --> 2:18:25.680]  He's a professor of law at George Mason University School of Law before joining the faculty in 2007.
[2:18:25.680 --> 2:18:30.680]  I mean, he got John U. at another law school now saying torture kids and was recently confirmed by the U.S.
[2:18:30.680 --> 2:18:34.680]  Senate as a member of the Board of Directors of the United States Institute of Peace.
[2:18:34.680 --> 2:18:38.680]  He holds a Ph.D. from the Department of Government at Harvard.
[2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:43.680]  And he's written a bunch of books.
[2:18:43.680 --> 2:18:48.680]  Well, they're relying pretty heavily on his testimony and it seems like a bunch of bunk to me.
[2:18:48.680 --> 2:18:51.680]  So I'm going to have to research him some more. Okay, Alex, I appreciate it.
[2:18:51.680 --> 2:18:56.680]  Thank you so much. Appreciate that. Yeah, it's as you can call his office phone here.
[2:18:56.680 --> 2:19:01.680]  7-0-3-9-9-3-8-9-7-2 up on his own little bio.
[2:19:01.680 --> 2:19:05.680]  He's very proud of himself.
[2:19:05.680 --> 2:19:09.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, I think this song says it all.
[2:19:09.680 --> 2:19:10.680]  Don't get fooled again.
[2:19:10.680 --> 2:19:12.680]  Ladies and gentlemen, we'll be right back with Warrior Calls.
[2:19:12.680 --> 2:19:14.680]  A ton of news. Stay with us.
[2:19:14.680 --> 2:19:29.680]  Music plays
[2:19:44.680 --> 2:20:07.640]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to grounds here
[2:20:07.640 --> 2:20:11.560]  on, and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[2:20:11.560 --> 2:20:15.800]  The film's rising as a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a
[2:20:15.800 --> 2:20:18.400]  platform to tell their story.
[2:20:18.400 --> 2:20:27.400]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:20:27.400 --> 2:20:32.160]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world
[2:20:32.160 --> 2:20:34.440]  take action against their global masters.
[2:20:34.440 --> 2:20:37.600]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:20:37.600 --> 2:20:43.480]  He takes his hand off in year 3, 2, 1, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:20:43.480 --> 2:20:46.960]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[2:20:55.480 --> 2:20:59.160]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts
[2:20:59.160 --> 2:21:01.080]  and bring in martial law.
[2:21:01.080 --> 2:21:08.680]  Gold, it's like nothing else on Earth, from the Romans through the Renaissance, from the
[2:21:08.680 --> 2:21:09.680]  industrial age to the space age.
[2:21:09.680 --> 2:21:10.680]  Gold has weathered the test of time.
[2:21:10.680 --> 2:21:14.720]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[2:21:14.720 --> 2:21:18.840]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[2:21:18.840 --> 2:21:23.280]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common sense alternative to
[2:21:23.280 --> 2:21:26.960]  a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.

[2:24:20.400 --> 2:24:27.880]  Waging war on corruption, crashing for the lies and disinformation.
[2:24:27.880 --> 2:24:28.880]  Why did I choose those terms?
[2:24:28.880 --> 2:24:33.600]  One of my first radio liners 12 years ago because that's what we're doing.
[2:24:33.600 --> 2:24:35.120]  We don't have time for maneuvers.
[2:24:35.120 --> 2:24:40.240]  We are going straight at them, throwing our bodies against the machine.
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:46.200]  That is the surest tactic to not question anymore that you're doing the perfect job,
[2:24:46.200 --> 2:24:48.840]  the best job, just know you're doing your job.
[2:24:48.840 --> 2:24:53.520]  Know you're taking action and doing the best you can, throwing yourself against the new
[2:24:53.520 --> 2:24:57.140]  old order, war mocks, against their war machines.
[2:24:57.140 --> 2:24:58.440]  They are not juggernauts.
[2:24:58.440 --> 2:25:03.000]  They have already been slowed down, defeated on many fronts.
[2:25:03.000 --> 2:25:08.240]  Their criminal evil is being exposed on a planetary scale.
[2:25:08.240 --> 2:25:19.760]  So intensify in little ways, in big ways, whatever you can do, who much is given, much is expected.
[2:25:19.760 --> 2:25:24.840]  Some of you don't have much, you're not expected to do much, but you're expected to do something
[2:25:24.840 --> 2:25:32.120]  in this fight against the new world order, to never surrender, to never give in, to understand
[2:25:32.120 --> 2:25:36.960]  what violations of your bill of rights and constitution mean, to understand the control
[2:25:36.960 --> 2:25:43.280]  grid, the slave system that is being built around us, and to realize that the full scope
[2:25:43.280 --> 2:25:47.640]  is the biggest part of the battle, and then to take action against it, because if you
[2:25:47.640 --> 2:25:52.960]  realize just how serious, just how real this is, I don't know who among you would not resist
[2:25:52.960 --> 2:25:55.040]  it and speak out against it and take action against it.
[2:25:55.040 --> 2:25:59.000]  You need to make fighting tyranny, and waking your fellow men and women up, regardless of
[2:25:59.000 --> 2:26:04.840]  race, color, and creed, your main priority, not bobbles, not trinkets, not acting cool,
[2:26:04.840 --> 2:26:06.760]  not partying.
[2:26:06.760 --> 2:26:07.760]  That has to go by the wayside.
[2:26:07.760 --> 2:26:11.080]  I mean, the economy is going to get so bad, that's going to end regardless.
[2:26:11.080 --> 2:26:14.600]  The more your call is coming up, we're going to have Freeman in studio later in the shower.
[2:26:14.600 --> 2:26:20.600]  I want to play some of Dennis Kucinich's opening remarks, or in their completeness, coming
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:25.480]  up in the next segment when we start that.
[2:26:25.480 --> 2:26:27.720]  Towards the end of the show, I think I'll play a little bit of what Bob Barr has to
[2:26:27.720 --> 2:26:34.120]  say, or Vincent Bugliozzi, let's get that clip up too, so we can play some of his powerful
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:42.760]  remarks before this transmission ends today.
[2:26:42.760 --> 2:26:46.600]  Here is some of the other news that I have in front of me.
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:54.400]  Navy prosecutor in Gitmo case says, fourth plane shot down, Reuters, the prosecutor in
[2:26:54.400 --> 2:27:00.520]  the trial talking about how deadly and evil the hijackers were, talked about how the Air
[2:27:00.520 --> 2:27:07.920]  Force shot down Flight 93.
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:12.760]  Now we already told you that six and a half years ago, with sources.
[2:27:12.760 --> 2:27:18.440]  I think you're so dumb, they even had a ceremony giving the pilot an award.
[2:27:18.440 --> 2:27:21.160]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:25.480]  And of course, we have the tapes and the witnesses and air traffic control hearing them.
[2:27:25.480 --> 2:27:33.000]  The pilot saying, okay, I've put fired to aim nines, which is the term for side winder
[2:27:33.000 --> 2:27:34.000]  missiles.
[2:27:34.000 --> 2:27:38.000]  But there's nothing to see here.
[2:27:38.000 --> 2:27:39.000]  Just move along.
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:40.640]  The government loves you and they never lie.
[2:27:40.640 --> 2:27:48.000]  U.S. foreclosures that double as house prices decline, Bloomberg, U.S. foreclosure failings
[2:27:48.000 --> 2:27:53.080]  more than doubled in the second quarter from a year earlier as falling home prices left
[2:27:53.080 --> 2:27:59.080]  borrowers owing more on mortgages than their properties were worth, one in every 171 homes
[2:27:59.080 --> 2:28:04.520]  was foreclosed on receiving a default notice or was warned of a pending auction.
[2:28:04.520 --> 2:28:10.680]  This was an increase of 121% from a year earlier and 14% from the first quarter.
[2:28:10.680 --> 2:28:15.960]  Reality Track Inc. said today in a statement, almost 740,000 properties were in some stage
[2:28:15.960 --> 2:28:20.920]  of foreclosure, the most since the Irvine California based company began reporting in
[2:28:20.920 --> 2:28:26.760]  January 2005, rising foreclosures are putting downward pressure on prices, increasing the
[2:28:26.760 --> 2:28:31.160]  possibility that homeowners will go upside down their mortgages to Cheryl King, chief
[2:28:31.160 --> 2:28:35.720]  U.S. economist and Merrill Lynch Co. in New York.
[2:28:35.720 --> 2:28:41.960]  And here's the really big news for you today also from Bloomberg, can find these stories
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:48.760]  easily at prisonplanet.com and infoworks.com, we have links to them, GM Ford on the verge
[2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:56.200]  of bankruptcy. Meanwhile, the Fed chairman says the economy is great over the private bank
[2:28:57.160 --> 2:29:00.280]  using double think on the cattle calling it federal reserve against everything's
[2:29:00.280 --> 2:29:05.480]  information warfare lies, lies spewed on top of lies, just look at all around you just a
[2:29:05.480 --> 2:29:11.080]  tissue of lies. General Motors Corporation, Ford Motor Company, the two biggest U.S.
[2:29:11.080 --> 2:29:17.400]  automakers have about a 46% chance of default within five years, according to Edward Altman,
[2:29:17.400 --> 2:29:23.000]  a finance professor at New York University Stern Business School. That is a rosy outlook, by the
[2:29:23.000 --> 2:29:28.440]  way. Both are in very serious shape and the markets reflect that. Altman, the creator of the Z-Score
[2:29:28.440 --> 2:29:32.840]  mathematical formula that measures bankruptcy risk, said an interview with Bloomberg Television,
[2:29:32.840 --> 2:29:38.120]  the model shows these companies are on the verge of bankruptcy, he said. The worst condition in
[2:29:38.120 --> 2:29:44.040]  Ford, Altman said GM reported a 38.7 billion loss in 2007, the biggest in its 100 year history
[2:29:44.040 --> 2:29:50.120]  and hasn't posted a profit since 2004. We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, transmission
[2:29:50.120 --> 2:29:58.920]  continues. We're on the march, the empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[2:31:18.680 --> 2:31:25.160]  order grew. Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[2:31:25.160 --> 2:31:34.200]  80% of humanity is at hand. For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government

[2:33:34.760 --> 2:33:41.160]  not just for the republic, but for the entire planet. I want to go ahead and play you dinner
[2:33:41.160 --> 2:33:45.640]  to send us his opening remarks later on a placement with Bob Barr was saying unbelievable.
[2:33:45.640 --> 2:33:49.480]  I've kind of been suspicious of him being CIA and the rest, but he was just now there in the
[2:33:49.480 --> 2:33:54.680]  break. I mean laying out how ridiculous people defending the administration were and how all
[2:33:54.680 --> 2:34:00.920]  the crimes they've committed on the face of it, it was extremely powerful. And look, I mean,
[2:34:00.920 --> 2:34:04.200]  there's a lot of people in the power structure that don't want to see this fully brought into
[2:34:04.200 --> 2:34:09.640]  fruition. I mean, this is serious, folks. What you're seeing is the darkest tyranny ever risen
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:14.840]  on the planet. And look past Bush, he is only the distraction in Barack Obama and John McCain.
[2:34:14.840 --> 2:34:19.960]  I keep repeating that. I know you know that, but we've got to tell everybody else. So they're
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:23.960]  not neutralized. We're going to continue with calls for the rest of broadcast. Freeman was
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:27.560]  scheduled last week and I love him to death. And I want to hear his great info on the esoteric
[2:34:27.560 --> 2:34:31.000]  gang language of the new world order and he'll be with us, but we'll continue also to cover
[2:34:31.000 --> 2:34:37.000]  the impeachment situation. Here is Dennis Kucinich, ladies and gentlemen. I want to thank the chair
[2:34:37.000 --> 2:34:45.240]  for this opportunity to testify. And I want to I want to thank the chair for this opportunity
[2:34:45.240 --> 2:34:52.680]  to testify. And I want to recognize my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, ranking member Smith,
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:35:02.920]  and my colleagues from the house who I work with, who are my friends who I respect their
[2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:09.080]  integrity and their honor. And I think it's important that we proceed among ourselves in that way and
[2:35:09.880 --> 2:35:14.440]  so that we can be of service to our nation in the highest manner.
[2:35:17.080 --> 2:35:23.800]  Our country has been at war in Iraq and has occupied the streets and villages of Iraq
[2:35:23.800 --> 2:35:34.360]  for five years, four months, and six days. The war has caused the deaths of 4127 American soldiers
[2:35:35.160 --> 2:35:41.960]  and the deaths of as many as one million innocent Iraqis. The war will cost the American people
[2:35:42.760 --> 2:35:50.520]  upwards of $3 trillion and is the main contributing factor to the destruction of our domestic economy.
[2:35:50.520 --> 2:36:01.080]  Mr. Chairman, I would ask unanimous consent to enter S.J. Rez 45 and H.J. Rez 114 into the record.
[2:36:01.080 --> 2:36:08.760]  Without objection so ordered. The primary justifications for going to war outlined
[2:36:09.320 --> 2:36:14.760]  outlined in the legislation which the White House sent to Congress in October of 2002
[2:36:14.760 --> 2:36:23.080]  have been determined conclusively to be untrue. Iraq was not continuing to threaten
[2:36:23.080 --> 2:36:29.160]  the national security interests of the United States. Iraq was not continuing to possess and
[2:36:29.160 --> 2:36:36.680]  develop a significant chemical and biological weapons capability. Iraq was not actively seeking
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:43.720]  a nuclear weapons capability. Iraq did not have the willingness to attack the United States.
[2:36:43.720 --> 2:36:50.280]  Iraq had not demonstrated capability and willingness to use weapons of mass destruction.
[2:36:50.920 --> 2:36:58.200]  Iraq could not launch a surprise attack against the United States or its armed forces. Therefore,
[2:36:58.200 --> 2:37:03.720]  there was not an extreme magnitude of harm that would result in the United States that would
[2:37:03.720 --> 2:37:10.040]  result to the United States and its citizens from such an attack. The aforementioned did not
[2:37:10.040 --> 2:37:17.560]  justify the use of force by the United States to defend itself. Iraq had no connection with the
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:24.920]  attacks of 9-11 or with Al Qaeda's role in 9-11. Iraq possessed no weapons of mass destruction
[2:37:24.920 --> 2:37:31.320]  to transfer to anyone. Iraq had no weapons of mass destruction and therefore had no capability
[2:37:31.320 --> 2:37:37.240]  of launching a surprise attack against the United States or its armed forces and no capability
[2:37:37.240 --> 2:37:49.480]  to provide them to international terrorists who would do so. However, many members of Congress
[2:37:50.200 --> 2:37:56.200]  relied on these representations from the White House to inform their decision to support the
[2:37:56.200 --> 2:38:02.920]  legislation that authorized the use of force against Iraq. We all know present and former
[2:38:02.920 --> 2:38:12.520]  colleagues who have said that if they knew then what they know now, they would not have voted
[2:38:12.520 --> 2:38:21.880]  to permit an attack upon Iraq. The war was totally unnecessary, unprovoked, and unjustified.
[2:38:22.920 --> 2:38:29.080]  The question for Congress is this. What responsibility does the President and members
[2:38:29.080 --> 2:38:36.600]  of his administration have for that unnecessary, unprovoked, and unjustified war? The rules of
[2:38:36.600 --> 2:38:42.360]  the House prevent me or any witness from utilizing familiar terms, but we could put two and two
[2:38:42.360 --> 2:38:48.920]  together in our minds. We could draw inferences about culpability. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous
[2:38:48.920 --> 2:38:55.160]  consent to enter H.R.S. 333, H.R.S. 1258, and H.R.S. 1345 into the record.
[2:38:55.160 --> 2:39:00.760]  I request that each member read the three bills that I have authored,
[2:39:01.560 --> 2:39:07.080]  bills which are now awaiting consideration by the Judiciary Committee. I am confident that the
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:13.080]  reader will reach the same conclusions that I have about culpability. What then should we do
[2:39:13.080 --> 2:39:19.400]  about it? The decision before us is whether to honor our oath as members of Congress to support
[2:39:19.400 --> 2:39:23.960]  and defend the Constitution that has been trampled time and again over the last seven years.
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:31.000]  The decision before us is whether to stand up for the checks and balances designed by our founding
[2:39:31.000 --> 2:39:37.160]  fathers to prevent excessive power grabs by either the judicial, legislative, or executive branch
[2:39:37.160 --> 2:39:45.800]  of government. I believe the choice is clear. I ask this committee to think and then to act now
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:53.400]  in order to enable this Congress to right a very great wrong and to hold accountable those
[2:39:53.400 --> 2:40:00.520]  who misled this nation. I thank you. All right, ladies and gentlemen, we're going to play some
[2:40:00.520 --> 2:40:06.280]  more select clips of some of the other testimony, very eloquent, very well done. And later in the
[2:40:06.280 --> 2:40:11.560]  next hour, we're going to open the phones up on, and we got phones loaded on a lot of other key
[2:40:11.560 --> 2:40:17.240]  issues that listeners want to bring up. Freeman, of course, does his own radio show and his own
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:22.760]  TV show and made his own documentaries. It was Freeman that encoded my first films on the DVD
[2:40:22.760 --> 2:40:27.720]  for us at that job. America Destroyed by Design, the police state trilogy, Dark Secrets Inside
[2:40:27.720 --> 2:40:32.360]  Bohemian Grove. So he's done a lot of great work with us in the past, and he is going to be in
[2:40:32.360 --> 2:40:37.480]  studio with us for the next hour and 19 minutes to be precise. But we will play some more clips
[2:40:37.480 --> 2:40:42.520]  next hour of some of the key highlights of the impeachment hearing that is going on in the
[2:40:42.520 --> 2:40:48.440]  House of Representatives right now in the incredible testimony that we're hearing. But I want you
[2:40:48.440 --> 2:40:55.560]  to understand, they just arrested the editor of Vanity Fair last week trying to sneak into Bohemian
[2:40:55.560 --> 2:41:01.640]  Grove. When I first got on the air 13 years ago, I didn't believe in the occult. I know people were
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:05.480]  into it, but I didn't believe the elite was involved in it. I thought movies like Eyes Wide Shut
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:11.960]  that came out in the late 90s were ridiculous by Stanley Kubrick. I thought that was crazy
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:15.480]  conspiracy theorist in our movement. I was more conservative. I only go off what I can prove.
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:22.120]  But in deeper research in the last eight, nine years, I learned it was real. I'm the only person
[2:41:22.120 --> 2:41:28.440]  that ever successfully infiltrate the Bohemian Grove and not go to prison for it. The second
[2:41:28.440 --> 2:41:34.840]  fellow who got a job there and sent me video, he was sent to prison. Another individual went
[2:41:34.840 --> 2:41:40.120]  in there and was sent to prison on charges, Richard McCaslin, a separate individual.
[2:41:40.120 --> 2:41:47.000]  So this is very serious. And by the grace of God, I'm alive to even report this information to you.
[2:41:47.000 --> 2:41:51.320]  I'm prominent enough that they don't want to kill me and make everything that I've said and done
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:56.200]  be highlighted or have an exclamation point after it or be underlined, basically,
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:42:01.480]  is the best way of putting it. Legitimizing everything we cover. But I did sneak in on July
[2:42:01.480 --> 2:42:06.440]  15, 2000. They did engage in the ancient ritual that I want to talk to them about today with Freeman,
[2:42:06.440 --> 2:42:11.560]  who's an expert on this and also has made films of Tex Mars. I know Tex respects.
[2:42:12.760 --> 2:42:17.160]  And he's gone and investigated some of these groups. I've been a part of some of these mid-level
[2:42:17.160 --> 2:42:22.920]  groups, gone and investigated those. He has a lot of their writings. And when you see all-seeing
[2:42:22.920 --> 2:42:28.280]  eyes and peacocks as the symbols of corporations and triple-sixes, and you see the UN and their
[2:42:28.280 --> 2:42:33.240]  biological diversity assessment saying they want to conduct worldwide human sacrifices for the
[2:42:33.240 --> 2:42:37.720]  mother goddess, that's official UN law. That's in my film Road to Tyranny with the page number.
[2:42:37.720 --> 2:42:42.920]  You can get it at the library. I mean, you can't, that's the 95 and 87, two of them say it, biological
[2:42:42.920 --> 2:42:48.200]  diversity assessments as policy passed by the Secretary General and the full United Nations
[2:42:48.920 --> 2:42:55.240]  into UN policy and law. So, again, this all sounds crazy. It's what they're into. But we told you
[2:42:55.240 --> 2:43:00.040]  that the Republican leadership likes gay porn stars years ago, and now that's been all over the
[2:43:00.040 --> 2:43:04.760]  mainstream news. And if you don't know about it, just Google Jeff Cannon. So we're covering things
[2:43:04.760 --> 2:43:09.240]  that are bizarre, but things that are true and really happening. They understand their mindset
[2:43:09.240 --> 2:43:13.800]  and what we're facing. And so joining us for the next hour in 15 minutes or so is Freeman,
[2:43:13.800 --> 2:43:18.120]  again, your calls coming up in the next hour on any issue we should discuss. But I wanted to have
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:23.000]  him back for part two to get more into this, and then also their mind control operations, Disney,
[2:43:23.000 --> 2:43:30.200]  the rest of some of the really esoteric stuff that he's broken down that we'll be going over
[2:43:30.200 --> 2:43:34.840]  today. Freeman, thanks for coming in. Hey, it's great to be here, Alex. Fantastic. Great to have
[2:43:34.840 --> 2:43:39.320]  you here with us. Go ahead and show us that book first. Yeah, well, you know, one of the things
[2:43:39.320 --> 2:43:45.800]  when we're looking at the occult is to realize the amount of knowledge that is put into such
[2:43:46.600 --> 2:43:51.160]  a study that this is a science that has been around for quite some time. This is the complete
[2:43:51.160 --> 2:43:58.840]  system of magic of the Golden Dawn. Now, that is one of the magical organizations that Alistair
[2:43:58.840 --> 2:44:04.760]  Crowley was a member of and then became leader and left, and then started the OTO, which is
[2:44:04.760 --> 2:44:11.000]  large here in Austin. Actually, Alistair Crowley's handwritten works. Now, looking at magic,
[2:44:11.000 --> 2:44:16.120]  looking at what these men do, they channel entities. This is their goal. This is the goal
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:22.280]  of ritual magic. And Alistair Crowley is one of these fine members that has channeled entities
[2:44:22.280 --> 2:44:28.840]  and they believe from Atlantis. And this book is stored right here on the UT campus. Alistair
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:33.400]  Crowley's handwritten works are stored at the Harry Ransom Center right here next to the statue
[2:44:33.400 --> 2:44:40.280]  of the goddess again. So, you know, how far and how deep does this go when we look on campus and
[2:44:40.280 --> 2:44:45.640]  we find signs of Satan? Why did the elite admire Alistair Crowley? I mean, I know he was a part
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:50.280]  of most of European and British and US secret societies and had gone to the Great Pyramid
[2:44:50.280 --> 2:44:56.440]  and done rituals and claimed to have channeled Lucifer. Yes. And he, well, the reason he became
[2:44:56.440 --> 2:45:01.880]  as popular as he did was this book that's housed at the Harry Ransom Center, the Book of the Law.
[2:45:01.880 --> 2:45:07.240]  And in it, when he started to, now, what we're looking at in occultism is basically a map,
[2:45:07.240 --> 2:45:12.440]  a roadmap of the other side as they see it. Now, what I do is I study what Freemason study
[2:45:12.440 --> 2:45:15.880]  and try to understand what they're thinking. You know, where is their mindset? All of their
[2:45:16.760 --> 2:45:23.160]  proceedings are behind locked doors with a sordid guard standing out front. So, here we have all
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:27.480]  of our leaders. We've got the, of course, the founding fathers and everyone else coming down
[2:45:27.480 --> 2:45:33.880]  through the ages, all being Freemasonic. You know, over half of our presidents belong to a lodge.
[2:45:33.880 --> 2:45:37.080]  And the reason we don't know what's going on inside is because they don't want us to know
[2:45:37.080 --> 2:45:46.520]  they keep these doors locked. That's like whenever Tim Russert asked then presidential candidate
[2:45:48.120 --> 2:45:51.960]  Kerry, John Kerry about, well, you and Bush are in the same society, Scull and Bones. Tell
[2:45:51.960 --> 2:45:55.240]  us about it. He goes, well, I'm not going to tell you. It's a secret. And they just laughed at him.
[2:45:55.240 --> 2:46:00.520]  Right. Exactly. And all the public says Scull and Bones doesn't exist. Oh, yeah. They can admit
[2:46:00.520 --> 2:46:04.920]  it exists, but the people have been trained in hypnotism or what the elite call a spell
[2:46:04.920 --> 2:46:08.760]  to be pre-programmed that didn't exist. And that's exactly what they do. They are our
[2:46:08.760 --> 2:46:15.720]  reality manufacturers. And this is how they do it. They create these icons, these ideologies
[2:46:16.520 --> 2:46:22.200]  using symbols. And they know the powers of symbols. And so, when we get to Alistair Crowley,
[2:46:22.200 --> 2:46:28.200]  we find that what he has done is made contact with an entity and most of the magicians believed
[2:46:28.200 --> 2:46:32.920]  him. Most people in these occult orders believe that he had made an actual contact. And this
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:38.600]  is what propelled him to the height of the order because he had made this contact with Iwas. This
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:44.680]  was supposed to land to an entity. And like I say, that is kept at the Harry Ransom Center here
[2:46:44.680 --> 2:46:50.440]  in Austin. So, this is what propelled Alistair Crowley to the top of the spectrum is that they
[2:46:50.440 --> 2:46:55.640]  believe he actually had contact. Now, what we continually find is that this contact and these
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:47:04.120]  studies go through genealogy. And they are very into genealogy. You will find this through all
[2:47:04.120 --> 2:47:08.600]  of them, through all the different occult organizations, through Mormonism, through even our
[2:47:08.600 --> 2:47:16.200]  own presidencies. We find genealogy being the ruling line, the ruling study that these men
[2:47:16.200 --> 2:47:21.720]  follow. So, what we have to ask, what is it about genealogy that's so important to magic?
[2:47:21.720 --> 2:47:28.520]  And I find that these that have the so-called God blood that come down from the pharaonic bloodlines
[2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:32.280]  have a better contact with these other realms.
[2:47:32.280 --> 2:47:35.720]  Well, that's what they believe. And we're here looking today at what they believe.
[2:47:35.720 --> 2:47:36.120]  Exactly.
[2:47:36.120 --> 2:47:40.280]  I don't believe it. But we need to understand the elite and their mindset and what they're into
[2:47:40.840 --> 2:47:44.680]  and why they have these symbols and I think they're getting power from these symbols. I mean,
[2:47:44.680 --> 2:47:48.440]  what types of things does Alistair Crowley's book cover?
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:55.160]  Well, the book of the law is definitely one of the most disturbing books I've read. It promotes
[2:47:55.160 --> 2:48:00.360]  violence, aggression, just all kinds of what we would call satanic affairs.
[2:48:01.240 --> 2:48:05.480]  I was watching on national Israeli television a clip on YouTube the other day of a top rabbi
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:08.920]  saying we want aggression. We want the ego. We want to be violent. We want, and this was this
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:12.040]  particular sect, for the Kabbalah that's really what that's about.
[2:48:12.040 --> 2:48:17.000]  Yes, exactly. And they believe in this order out of chaos and so if they can get more people to
[2:48:17.000 --> 2:48:22.360]  get into the chaotic state, then they have more control. We keep finding this over and over again
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:28.120]  throughout their actions. Personally, I find that, you know, I've been to Benjamin Franklin's
[2:48:28.120 --> 2:48:33.960]  lodge in Philadelphia and you go into the Benjamin Franklin Hall there and you'll find a sperm,
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:40.120]  a golden sperm son sitting there. So for me, this goes back to all the way to the creation of America
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:48.440]  and its purpose. Now we find America being turned into a satanic force. We find it encoded
[2:48:48.440 --> 2:48:54.520]  each and every way that we can in the 666s that we've uncovered in corporate logos and
[2:48:54.520 --> 2:49:02.440]  CERN and even the meaning of W and VW. We get to these concepts of the satanic order.
[2:49:02.440 --> 2:49:08.760]  And as I see it, as they're promoting us through their mass media, you know, which also they are
[2:49:08.760 --> 2:49:13.320]  making us lower level initiates. We're being brought through initiations. That's what 24 is
[2:49:13.320 --> 2:49:19.080]  and the White House putting out memos saying we torture children. They are now indoctrinating
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:25.080]  us in their mindset. Yes. And making us appear to the rest of the world to be a satanic force.
[2:49:25.080 --> 2:49:31.560]  And certainly when we start to look into what fascism is, we get to corporatism and we find that
[2:49:32.280 --> 2:49:36.440]  through my Masonic studies, through my studies of corporate logos and their
[2:49:36.440 --> 2:49:43.480]  incorporation into Masonic rituals. So if we follow each corporate logo into Masonic ritual,
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:50.680]  you can outline every single corporate logo into a Masonic ritual. We're looking at fascism. We're
[2:49:50.680 --> 2:49:56.360]  looking at corporatism. We're looking at a secret cabal that has been moving an agenda forward
[2:49:56.360 --> 2:50:02.440]  through the means of corporatism. And so then now we must realize that these men are globalist.
[2:50:02.440 --> 2:50:09.960]  They are globalist. And so they are not dedicated to America, right? Within the Freemasonic rituals,
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:15.880]  you must admit that you first serve the brotherhood and then whatever nation you happen to be in.
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:20.200]  For internet viewers at prisonplanet.tv, we're streaming live. This will be encoded and posted
[2:50:20.200 --> 2:50:23.640]  at prisonplanet.tv later. For everybody else, we'll be right back on the other side. We're
[2:50:23.640 --> 2:50:27.400]  going to continue behind the scenes for infowars.com. Audio stream listeners.
[2:50:27.400 --> 2:50:37.080]  All right. Well, we cannot deny the allegiance being shown through corporate logos, through
[2:50:37.080 --> 2:50:42.680]  the different symbolism that are being shown to us from the pentagram of Texaco, the shell of shell,
[2:50:42.680 --> 2:50:49.640]  the eye in the pyramid of AOL, and all of the others. As you look into my studies on freemantv.com,
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:56.280]  you can see all the different outlines in Freemasonic worship and allegiance in the
[2:50:56.280 --> 2:51:01.640]  corporate of corporations. Corporatism is fascism. And as I went around to the different war
[2:51:01.640 --> 2:51:06.840]  memorials all around America that were dedicated to the goddess and her death, right, the death,
[2:51:06.840 --> 2:51:12.360]  they always have a dead man with the goddess. I have in England, in France, in Latin America,
[2:51:13.000 --> 2:51:18.040]  that all the war memorials, it's the goddess and her cherubin or other sub goddesses looking down
[2:51:18.040 --> 2:51:23.160]  on the memorial. And they got World War One ones in London, where it'll say 214,000 in,
[2:51:23.160 --> 2:51:27.800]  you know, infantry in this battle. And it'll show them, and she's looking down, accepting
[2:51:27.800 --> 2:51:33.000]  the sacrifice. Yes, exactly. And those are all over America as well. And it says, oh,
[2:51:33.000 --> 2:51:39.800]  we worship the glorious death around one. Yes. Yes. Now, one of the earliest cities in America
[2:51:39.800 --> 2:51:45.880]  is St. Augustine. And when I did a filming campaign there, I found some most amazing things,
[2:51:45.880 --> 2:51:54.280]  such as the numerous obelisks or Osiris' phallus that were in this city courtyard. But these
[2:51:54.280 --> 2:52:01.160]  phalluses, the obelisks stand right over the slave market where they sold humans. And then on
[2:52:01.160 --> 2:52:07.320]  that phallus it says, our dead. And then you have Flagler's College that's surrounded by
[2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:14.760]  symbols of torture. It has an iron maiden and others. And then inside you find, again,
[2:52:14.760 --> 2:52:22.040]  the phallus and the bowl. You'll find that there is... Well, where they killed William Wallace
[2:52:22.040 --> 2:52:28.280]  in London, they built a giant spike, a huge phallus. Yes. Amazing. They want to keep this in
[2:52:28.280 --> 2:52:33.080]  our minds. And they want to keep these type of people in our minds. They will highlight
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:39.160]  different people as symbols. So as we hold George Washington as a symbol instead of a man.
[2:52:39.160 --> 2:52:48.920]  Icons. Icons, absolutely. So in St. Augustine, in the first city of America, we find the roots
[2:52:48.920 --> 2:52:54.600]  of Freemasonry right there at the very get-go, right at the very beginning, with their phalluses,
[2:52:54.600 --> 2:52:59.080]  with the... But then I found other interesting things that connected to Bohemian Grove,
[2:52:59.800 --> 2:53:06.600]  where they had a portal or a freeze in front of the... Over this archway with an owl and a portal
[2:53:06.600 --> 2:53:10.200]  and a traumatized angel in the other... I'll tell you what, we're coming back to the main
[2:53:10.200 --> 2:53:15.080]  transmission. Let's start there and get more into Bohemian Grove and then get into some of
[2:53:15.080 --> 2:53:20.360]  the Ann and Nicole Smith and all that crazy stuff. And of course, Britney Spears and most
[2:53:20.360 --> 2:53:25.000]  these girls are then tied into Disney. Here we go. We're coming back to the main transmission.
[2:53:25.000 --> 2:53:37.000]  Present wanta.com.
[2:53:37.000 --> 2:53:43.000]  Tell all the folks to rush up and try to do
[2:53:45.000 --> 2:53:51.000]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board
[2:53:52.000 --> 2:53:59.000]  And let this train keep on riding, riding on through
[2:53:59.000 --> 2:54:05.000]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board
[2:54:05.000 --> 2:54:25.000]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board
[2:54:35.000 --> 2:54:46.000]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:56.000]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board
[2:54:56.000 --> 2:55:14.000]  Don't you know that it's time to get on board
[2:55:14.000 --> 2:55:34.000]  And this is how we find out
[2:55:34.000 --> 2:55:43.000]  So we look at when they start to promote to us the different icons and the ideals to us, then they want to set us up for their agenda.
[2:55:44.000 --> 2:55:52.000]  And so like in the latest current hits we find, oh shoot I forgot her name at this moment, but she sings a song about kissing a girl.
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:58.000]  Many little teenage girls are going around singing about kissing a girl in her cherry lipstick.
[2:55:58.000 --> 2:56:04.000]  This gets imprinted into our mind, there's been numerous occasions where this type of programming is being used.
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:08.000]  So we find it, most especially in the pop stars and the pop icons.
[2:56:09.000 --> 2:56:19.000]  And so we find that Led Zeppelin followed Alistair Crowley, Beatles followed Alistair Crowley, The Rolling Stones followed Alistair Crowley, and all of these different lists that you can go down.
[2:56:20.000 --> 2:56:22.000]  And then they are instilling mind pattern programming into the children.
[2:56:22.000 --> 2:56:31.000]  So you'll find that every song by Kiss is about sex or rape, but yet you wouldn't know this at 10 years old when I was listening to Kiss.
[2:56:32.000 --> 2:56:35.000]  I didn't know I was singing about sex, I didn't know what they were programming into me.
[2:56:36.000 --> 2:56:42.000]  So we find that they are using these icons and the icons are mostly willing to be part of this system like Madonna.
[2:56:43.000 --> 2:56:47.000]  Now Madonna has gone full blown into her cabalistic studies and has now-
[2:56:47.000 --> 2:56:53.000]  And by the way, she admits that you would say six, seven, eight years ago, I would talk about her and all the occult rituals she was doing.
[2:56:54.000 --> 2:56:59.000]  You know, we would talk about how the entire production was a ritual, we get laughed at.
[2:57:00.000 --> 2:57:00.000]  Now she says it is.
[2:57:01.000 --> 2:57:01.000]  Exactly.
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:02.000]  Oh, so we're right again as usual.
[2:57:03.000 --> 2:57:10.000]  And she's gone on to take on the name Esther, which is another form of Ishtar, which is back to our same Illuminati goddess here.
[2:57:11.000 --> 2:57:13.000]  Now, yes, and she is used in these high profile rituals.
[2:57:13.000 --> 2:57:17.000]  And by the way, she's always been real healthy now, she's getting anemic, she's getting real sick.
[2:57:18.000 --> 2:57:19.000]  This stuff also destroys you.
[2:57:20.000 --> 2:57:20.000]  It seems to.
[2:57:21.000 --> 2:57:33.000]  I mean, if we're looking at other people in the icon era with Heath Ledger or well Anna Nicole and Brittany and all of them, it's definitely not good for your psyche, but it's also not good for your health.
[2:57:34.000 --> 2:57:40.000]  And yes, I'm starting to do a study on the deaths of these occultists because I want to see, you know, are they dying horrible deaths?
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:41.000]  Jim Morrison.
[2:57:41.000 --> 2:57:42.000]  Yeah, most of them seem to.
[2:57:43.000 --> 2:57:47.000]  Even Manly P. Hall was found hours later after his death with ants crawling in and out of his body.
[2:57:48.000 --> 2:57:51.000]  So we do find a lot of these occultists dying horrible deaths.
[2:57:52.000 --> 2:57:55.000]  And one of such death that I have tracked was the death of Anna Nicole.
[2:57:56.000 --> 2:57:56.000]  Ah, stay there.
[2:57:57.000 --> 2:58:01.000]  We got a break for 70 seconds, the fourth and final hour on this Friday edition straight ahead.
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:03.000]  But we don't stop there.

[2:59:53.000 --> 2:59:59.000]  Freeman is our guest for infowars.com, audio stream listeners and prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[3:00:00.000 --> 3:00:01.000]  We're going to be skipping some of the breaks today.
[3:00:02.000 --> 3:00:06.000]  So if you're listening on the web and don't want to miss any of those, be sure and go get on the right stream, infowars.com.
[3:00:07.000 --> 3:00:08.000]  Those are different streams there in the network.
[3:00:09.000 --> 3:00:10.000]  Freeman, continue.
[3:00:11.000 --> 3:00:15.000]  I want to get into the Masonic information, the messages and the money, because they believe in great power.
[3:00:15.000 --> 3:00:16.000]  That's past.
[3:00:17.000 --> 3:00:19.000]  They believe that commerce is a ritual.
[3:00:20.000 --> 3:00:21.000]  So it's added ritual.
[3:00:22.000 --> 3:00:24.000]  They believe us carrying it out over and over again adds to it.
[3:00:25.000 --> 3:00:28.000]  And so I want to get into why they showed the Pentagon attack, the World Trade Center's attack on the money.
[3:00:29.000 --> 3:00:31.000]  I mean, everybody looks at people that don't even believe us about not letting them make an inside job.
[3:00:32.000 --> 3:00:33.000]  Oh my God, that is that.
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:37.000]  In the series of money that came out the year before the attacks, I want to go through all that.
[3:00:38.000 --> 3:00:40.000]  But right now, Disney's been caught with occultism.
[3:00:41.000 --> 3:00:42.000]  Like we told you Madonna was doing rituals.
[3:00:42.000 --> 3:00:49.000]  So we told you Britney Spears was and now they admit they are kissing and with a snake and the dancers and now they admit.
[3:00:50.000 --> 3:00:51.000]  Okay, so see, there's not debating.
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:53.000]  They admit it.
[3:00:54.000 --> 3:00:55.000]  But still you've been programmed to say it's not real.
[3:00:56.000 --> 3:00:57.000]  Same thing with Disney.
[3:00:58.000 --> 3:00:59.000]  Same thing with the Mousketeers.
[3:01:00.000 --> 3:01:01.000]  Get into that.
[3:01:02.000 --> 3:01:06.000]  Yes, now when we're looking at these genealogies once again, a few of them might surprise you.
[3:01:06.000 --> 3:01:13.000]  Now, as we know, we can't prove much of this with like Hitler's mom being a maid in the Rothschild mansion, right?
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:15.000]  Well, Disney's bloodline is the same.
[3:01:16.000 --> 3:01:17.000]  It's hidden, it's coded.
[3:01:18.000 --> 3:01:19.000]  Nobody knows who Disney's dad really is.
[3:01:20.000 --> 3:01:21.000]  Same thing with the Bushes.
[3:01:22.000 --> 3:01:23.000]  And the same with the Bushes and the Pierce, which we'll get to.
[3:01:23.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  So when we start to look into the picture, we find that, okay, first of all, Walt Disney was hired by J. Edgar Hoover to instill mind pattern programming into the children.
[3:01:36.000 --> 3:01:37.000]  It was an FBI plan.
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:39.000]  It was instigated.
[3:01:40.000 --> 3:01:41.000]  That's come out of the FBI was involved with Disney.
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:43.000]  That's mainline history.
[3:01:44.000 --> 3:01:45.000]  Yes.
[3:01:46.000 --> 3:01:49.000]  And we will find it was a E.E. Conroy that was the actual officer that got Disney involved.
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:56.000]  When we come down through it, we find that, of course, Walt Disney World is nothing more than a military industrial corporation.
[3:01:57.000 --> 3:02:01.000]  The whole ride, every show in there, every ride is sponsored by a military corporation.
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:07.000]  So we've got pretty much their dream, their utopia as symbolized in Walt Disney World.
[3:02:08.000 --> 3:02:11.000]  So now what happens is we've got these list of Mouse Keteers.
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:23.000]  We've got Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Lindsay Lohan, Justin Timberlake, and then Madonna and Prince and Michael Jackson were also all affiliated with Walt Disney, but not Mouse Keteers.
[3:02:24.000 --> 3:02:29.000]  And what we find are these five people have won the Emmys the last five years in a row or two years in a row.
[3:02:30.000 --> 3:02:31.000]  This is ridiculous.
[3:02:32.000 --> 3:02:33.000]  This is obvious to me.
[3:02:34.000 --> 3:02:35.000]  This is quite obvious.
[3:02:36.000 --> 3:02:38.000]  And then what they will do is use these people in high profile rituals.
[3:02:38.000 --> 3:02:44.000]  And so at the Super Bowl, when Janet Jackson had her breast fall out.
[3:02:45.000 --> 3:02:46.000]  She had a sun on it.
[3:02:47.000 --> 3:02:48.000]  She had a sun on it.
[3:02:49.000 --> 3:02:53.000]  And this is the hermaphroditic symbol because the goddess is always shown bearing a breast and the god is always symbolized as golden sun.
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:57.000]  So we're back to the hermaphrodite and that's why they interrelate the god and goddess type.
[3:02:58.000 --> 3:02:59.000]  Male female.
[3:03:00.000 --> 3:03:01.000]  Exactly, the male and female.
[3:03:02.000 --> 3:03:06.000]  And you can see this incorporated in all their architecture, the symbol of target, the very symbol of the star David.
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  And so that was a black magic ritual at the Super Bowl.
[3:03:10.000 --> 3:03:11.000]  Right, using us as the people to watch.
[3:03:12.000 --> 3:03:16.000]  Then you can, and of course they believe this gives the spell more power that everybody's watching.
[3:03:17.000 --> 3:03:18.000]  Everybody's performing the same thing Hitler did.
[3:03:19.000 --> 3:03:23.000]  So then we come down further and we've got Brittany and Madonna and Christina Aguilera.
[3:03:24.000 --> 3:03:28.000]  So we've got all the Mouse Keteers once again coming down in another high profile ritual at the MTV Awards.
[3:03:29.000 --> 3:03:33.000]  And this is the one where Madonna is dressed as a worshipful master in her top hat and her gloves.
[3:03:33.000 --> 3:03:38.000]  Or a black tuxedo like a worshipful master of a freemasonic lodge coming down the stairs
[3:03:39.000 --> 3:03:44.000]  and doing an alchemical wedding with Brittany and Christina Aguilera, the two Mouse Keteers.
[3:03:45.000 --> 3:03:49.000]  Giving an open mouth kiss to Brittany Spears and a closed mouth kiss to Christina Aguilera,
[3:03:50.000 --> 3:03:52.000]  which is also symbolic of the left hand and right hand paths of magic.
[3:03:53.000 --> 3:03:57.000]  Yeah, the right hand wasn't as intense, but she gives the wild passion and left hand path to Brittany.
[3:03:58.000 --> 3:03:59.000]  Exactly.
[3:03:59.000 --> 3:04:05.000]  And we can find the same symbolism being incorporated in the temple of the goddess in Nashville with the Parthenon.
[3:04:06.000 --> 3:04:08.000]  You have the goddess with the sprite putting the wreath on her head.
[3:04:09.000 --> 3:04:14.000]  I found the same symbolism in the capital of Jackson, Mississippi with the goddess putting the wreath on.
[3:04:15.000 --> 3:04:19.000]  And I can go around and find the same symbolism in Masonic architecture over and over again.
[3:04:20.000 --> 3:04:21.000]  All right, we're going to take this break.
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:23.000]  We're going to skip the 20 after.
[3:04:24.000 --> 3:04:25.000]  We'll frame it all the time we have with him.
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:36.000]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to Ground Zero and we knew what to do.
[3:04:37.000 --> 3:04:38.000]  Or at least we thought we did.
[3:04:39.000 --> 3:04:45.000]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[3:04:45.000 --> 3:04:54.000]  Whitman, EPA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:05:01.000]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:05:02.000 --> 3:05:05.000]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[3:05:06.000 --> 3:05:10.000]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:14.000]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:05:23.000 --> 3:05:28.000]  If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[3:05:29.000 --> 3:05:33.000]  The pressures of everyday life can deliver a serious blow to your health.
[3:05:34.000 --> 3:05:38.000]  Stress increases blood pressure, potential heart problems, strokes, ulcers, depression, and insomnia.
[3:05:38.000 --> 3:05:41.000]  Stress suppresses your immune system and inhibits weight control.
[3:05:42.000 --> 3:05:44.000]  Stress makes you nervous, anxious, or irritable.
[3:05:45.000 --> 3:05:47.000]  Introducing nature's renewal supreme anti-stress formula.

[3:06:28.000 --> 3:06:35.000]  Hey Bonnie, no more pickpocketing for us. I have an easier way we can steal people's credit cards without them even knowing they've been robbed.
[3:06:36.000 --> 3:06:37.000]  How so, Clyde?
[3:06:38.000 --> 3:06:45.000]  I have this RFID reader I picked up on the internet. Just by waving it near you, I can skin your credit card information while your cards are still in your purse. Just watch.
[3:06:46.000 --> 3:06:49.000]  Hey look, that's my info on the screen. You gotta be kidding me.
[3:06:50.000 --> 3:06:56.000]  Nope, with 50 million credit cards with hidden RFID chips, I figure we'll make a fortune. As long as people don't hear about identity stronghold.
[3:06:56.000 --> 3:06:58.000]  Why? What's identity stronghold?
[3:06:59.000 --> 3:07:04.000]  They make the secure sleeve. When people keep their credit cards in the shielded secure sleeve, I can't read them.
[3:07:05.000 --> 3:07:07.000]  Do a lot of people already know about the secure sleeve?
[3:07:08.000 --> 3:07:11.000]  No way. Most people don't realize they even have chips in their credit cards and passports.
[3:07:12.000 --> 3:07:14.000]  Clyde, we should get some of those secure sleeves.
[3:07:15.000 --> 3:07:17.000]  I already got some. I also got some to fit our passports.
[3:07:18.000 --> 3:07:22.000]  Identity stronghold has secure sleeves for sale right on the internet at IDstronghold.com.
[3:07:23.000 --> 3:07:24.000]  IDstronghold.com?
[3:07:24.000 --> 3:07:28.000]  Right, or you can call them at 1-800-610-2770.
[3:07:29.000 --> 3:07:36.000]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[3:07:36.000 --> 3:08:01.000]  So Freeman, they have these public rituals, these rock concerts, these Kabbalic rituals, it's all the same stuff.
[3:08:01.000 --> 3:08:08.000]  The Super Bowl, bearing the breast, the goddess always in all these statues bears one breast, and they have the sun symbol in with it.
[3:08:09.000 --> 3:08:12.000]  A lot of times in the big monuments you see a goddess carrying a standard that has a sun.
[3:08:13.000 --> 3:08:14.000]  So it's saying male and female.
[3:08:15.000 --> 3:08:19.000]  And if it's fully to the goddess, the sun will be below her, but most of them the sun is above.
[3:08:20.000 --> 3:08:22.000]  But it's showing union of those.
[3:08:23.000 --> 3:08:25.000]  Now they did the same thing with the money, because this is the biggest ritual.
[3:08:26.000 --> 3:08:28.000]  It's passing hands, it's being worshiped, it's being loved.
[3:08:28.000 --> 3:08:36.000]  You'll kill your grandmother, you know, shoot her and bet on which way she'll fall for this money that they produce, that their power comes from.
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:50.000]  And during the slideshow we've been showing, and as a cycle through you'll see the $5, $10, $20, the hundreds, all the different aspects, the towers on fire, even at the same levels, the collapse, the Pentagon, everything, break it down for us.
[3:08:51.000 --> 3:08:56.000]  Alright, well this was an interesting thing for me, and this is where having some foreknowledge of their tactics helps.
[3:08:56.000 --> 3:08:59.000]  Because now I had predicted the date of 9-11.
[3:09:00.000 --> 3:09:09.000]  I had followed through following the fall of Bill Clinton, the rise of the W, and at that moment knew that 9-11 would be the date that they'd pulled their major terrorist attack.
[3:09:10.000 --> 3:09:12.000]  And I told everyone I knew, unfortunately I didn't know you.
[3:09:13.000 --> 3:09:22.000]  So I didn't have it on here, but I had predicted the day of 9-11, and I didn't know what would occur, I just knew the date following the capitalism.
[3:09:22.000 --> 3:09:27.000]  Well, on that day I had a dozen people at my door standing there wondering how I knew.
[3:09:28.000 --> 3:09:36.000]  But now what was curious to me was that at least four of these people had their bills already folded up into the Twin Towers on 9-11, on the very day.
[3:09:37.000 --> 3:09:39.000]  Now for me being a conspiracy theorist, as it were...
[3:09:40.000 --> 3:09:44.000]  I remember the first place I saw that was Chris Luthanus and Corey Cortes and others on their show.
[3:09:44.000 --> 3:09:51.000]  First place that broke, I remember, for anybody within days they were folding money up, and then years later it was all over the news.
[3:09:52.000 --> 3:10:00.000]  Right. And now it was posted on the internet that day, and if somebody just happened to figure this out and all of a sudden show it on the very day, I don't believe.
[3:10:01.000 --> 3:10:03.000]  I believe that this is being shown to us letting us know.
[3:10:04.000 --> 3:10:05.000]  Now the curious thing is that those bills were...
[3:10:06.000 --> 3:10:08.000]  And they're letting you know, we're the ones that print the money, we're the ones that did it.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:09.000]  Exactly.
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:14.000]  It's like when Special Forces would leave an ace card in Vietnamese communists they'd killed.
[3:10:15.000 --> 3:10:15.000]  Yeah.
[3:10:16.000 --> 3:10:18.000]  It's a cue card. It's marking their territory.
[3:10:19.000 --> 3:10:25.000]  Now if we're looking at it esoterically, if we're looking at it from a magician's standpoint, they put these bills out in 1996.
[3:10:26.000 --> 3:10:28.000]  And that was when they made the first change.
[3:10:29.000 --> 3:10:32.000]  If you look at the bills prior to 96, they don't fold into the Twin Towers.
[3:10:32.000 --> 3:10:42.000]  I have pictures there if we can show them, showing the 20s where you can see that they don't fold into the Twin Towers prior to 96.
[3:10:43.000 --> 3:10:48.000]  And 1996 is the same year that Saddam Hussein is announcing he's Nebuchadnezzar reincarnated rebuilding the Tower of Babel.
[3:10:49.000 --> 3:10:52.000]  By the way, that was on the news. Again, Madonna admits she's doing rituals, they all do.
[3:10:53.000 --> 3:10:54.000]  He's announcing he's Nebuchadnezzar, Google that.
[3:10:55.000 --> 3:10:56.000]  I mean, again, they all believe this.
[3:10:56.000 --> 3:11:01.000]  Yeah, yeah. I mean, the headline of Y2K was Muslim stopped the Freemasons from capping the Great Pyramid with gold.
[3:11:02.000 --> 3:11:04.000]  I mean, this is stuff that's all been in the news. Everything I said.
[3:11:05.000 --> 3:11:08.000]  It was a big fight in Egypt. George Bush Sr. flies there and then they say, no, we're not capping it with gold.
[3:11:09.000 --> 3:11:12.000]  They had huge movie screens with horned goblins dancing and fire shooting up out of the ground.
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:13.000]  Yes.
[3:11:14.000 --> 3:11:22.000]  So we're looking at now with this bill and from 1996, not only did they rebuild Babylon with Nebuchadnezzar,
[3:11:22.000 --> 3:11:29.000]  they were also building the Nashville Bicentennial Mall that we talked about last time, which you can see pictures of on freemantv.com.
[3:11:30.000 --> 3:11:37.000]  These bills now in an esoteric and a magical state are already promoting to us the idea, the concept,
[3:11:38.000 --> 3:11:43.000]  because they believe that we have like a holographic mind and that we are able to incorporate this knowledge without actually seeing it.
[3:11:43.000 --> 3:11:52.000]  And so it's already been there for, since 1996, up to 2001, five years we've got it being imprinted into us through these bills.
[3:11:53.000 --> 3:11:59.000]  And then on the day, on 9-1-1, they allow us to see it. They put it out on their interweb.
[3:12:00.000 --> 3:12:06.000]  Now, what I found really interesting was that as they were promoting this, AOL, which of course, their symbol's the eye in the pyramid,
[3:12:06.000 --> 3:12:15.000]  was putting out a poll, because every time you turn on AOL, it gives you a little questionnaire, and their poll was, would you take a National ID card?
[3:12:16.000 --> 3:12:23.000]  And so they are instilling this mind pattern, predictive programming into us, they constantly are doing so,
[3:12:24.000 --> 3:12:26.000]  and they do it in what they consider magical means.
[3:12:27.000 --> 3:12:31.000]  Using exactly what the dollar bill is, is a talisman, it is simply a magical spell.
[3:12:31.000 --> 3:12:36.000]  This is the reason that the $1 bill has never changed, because it holds most of their archaic symbols.
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:39.000]  They don't want to change that.
[3:12:40.000 --> 3:12:45.000]  And so, but as we watch now, in their mind pattern programming, they're starting to make the bills less and less real.
[3:12:46.000 --> 3:12:54.000]  And they admit that, you're getting ready for a change, they admit that all these major mints are built as temples,
[3:12:55.000 --> 3:12:58.000]  and then you can even, as you said last week, you can even call up the mints and they'll admit it.
[3:12:58.000 --> 3:13:00.000]  Yes, yes, absolutely.
[3:13:01.000 --> 3:13:07.000]  And you'll find them dated to the Anolusius calendar, which is the Masonic calendar, the Age of Light, straight back to Lucifer again.
[3:13:08.000 --> 3:13:15.000]  But this is a magic spell, that is what the dollar is, it's known as a Panticole, a talisman, it's a symbol of what?
[3:13:16.000 --> 3:13:20.000]  You know, of a magic spell, it's an enchantment, it has no real value, it's a piece of paper.
[3:13:20.000 --> 3:13:29.000]  So, they are using these symbol, signs and seals to carry us forth, to bring us forward on their agenda,
[3:13:30.000 --> 3:13:37.000]  and we are lost in the enchantment, they're using Hollywood, they're using every method that they have at their disposal
[3:13:38.000 --> 3:13:42.000]  to bring us into this fascist dictatorship, this corporate reality that we're all begging for.
[3:13:43.000 --> 3:13:45.000]  They have us begging for it.
[3:13:46.000 --> 3:13:47.000]  Continue.
[3:13:47.000 --> 3:13:55.000]  Well, let's look at this just a little bit deeper, and as we're looking into how they bring us into their agenda,
[3:13:56.000 --> 3:14:02.000]  as how they do the bind pattern programming, we can travel all the way back to the blowing up of Parliament,
[3:14:03.000 --> 3:14:08.000]  the gunpowder plot of 1605, which was brought forth by two men known as Percy and Catesby.
[3:14:09.000 --> 3:14:14.000]  But of course, they didn't want these two men to come forward, instead they would bring about their fall guy,
[3:14:14.000 --> 3:14:19.000]  and Guido Fox, or Guy Fox, was originally the original fall guy.
[3:14:20.000 --> 3:14:27.000]  But this Percy bloodline that was known to be the instigators of the gunpowder plot to blow up King James in Parliament,
[3:14:28.000 --> 3:14:33.000]  their bloodline had to change their name to Pierce, and we find this Pierce bloodline comes down to Franklin Pierce,
[3:14:34.000 --> 3:14:39.000]  our 14th President of America, and we have the same bloodline from who tried to blow up King James,
[3:14:39.000 --> 3:14:43.000]  but of course, Franklin Pierce was then ousted and replaced by James Buchanan,
[3:14:44.000 --> 3:14:48.000]  who is the direct descendant of King James, the one who Pierce bloodline tried to blow up.
[3:14:49.000 --> 3:14:55.000]  So now is this happenstance? No, this is ritual, this is agenda, this is a moving forward, this is a bloodline agenda.
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:01.000]  And you have to understand that the Masons are always killing and re-killing and re-resurrecting Hiram Abif.
[3:15:02.000 --> 3:15:06.000]  So they're into this, doing the same ritual over and over again, they believe it gets more power each time.
[3:15:06.000 --> 3:15:11.000]  Exactly, exactly, and we come down to the Pierce bloodline coming down to Pauline Pierce.
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:20.000]  Now Pauline Pierce was friends with Alistair Crowley, and she is known to have gone off to France and had a ritual with Alistair Crowley.
[3:15:21.000 --> 3:15:26.000]  So Pauline Pierce and Alistair Crowley off doing, now what you must realize is once you get up in the higher levels of Freemasonry,
[3:15:27.000 --> 3:15:33.000]  with like the Ordo Templi Oriantis, the order of the OTO, this is sex ritual, sex magic,
[3:15:33.000 --> 3:15:37.000]  and that's where you get all of these hermaphroditic sexual symbols like target sun sign.
[3:15:38.000 --> 3:15:40.000]  So Pauline Pierce-
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:42.000]  Which is a pyramid from on top.
[3:15:43.000 --> 3:15:45.000]  Target symbols looking down a pyramid, a step pyramid.
[3:15:46.000 --> 3:15:51.000]  Pauline Pierce then has a sexual ritual with Alistair Crowley, she comes back and lo and behold she's pregnant.
[3:15:52.000 --> 3:15:57.000]  Now whether or not she was pregnant through Marvin or through Alistair Crowley is not known by the public,
[3:15:57.000 --> 3:16:02.000]  but then what we find is she gives birth to Barbara.
[3:16:03.000 --> 3:16:07.000]  Barbara Pierce then marries the head of the CIA, George H. W. Bush, and we have-
[3:16:08.000 --> 3:16:09.000]  And you've tracked this, this is a fact.
[3:16:10.000 --> 3:16:15.000]  Well as much as we can prove Hitler's a Rothschild, I can prove W is the grandson of the East.
[3:16:16.000 --> 3:16:20.000]  Well that's even the mainline history books that his father's mother did work in the Rothschild House,
[3:16:21.000 --> 3:16:23.000]  and that he did have a bunch of illegitimate children and did place her.
[3:16:23.000 --> 3:16:28.000]  And it was mainstream media when Pauline Pierce went to France with Alistair Crowley and had a sexual ritual.
[3:16:29.000 --> 3:16:32.000]  But then she is connected to Barbara.
[3:16:33.000 --> 3:16:35.000]  Yes, Pauline Pierce is Barbara Bush's mother.
[3:16:36.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  That is a fact.
[3:16:38.000 --> 3:16:39.000]  Yes, absolutely.
[3:16:40.000 --> 3:16:41.000]  That's unbelievable.
[3:16:42.000 --> 3:16:46.000]  You look at the picture and Barbara Bush looks very much like Alistair Crowley and that would make George W. Bush the grandson of the beast.
[3:16:47.000 --> 3:16:49.000]  666 and that's what Alistair Crowley called himself.
[3:16:49.000 --> 3:16:51.000]  Mr. Crowley called himself.
[3:16:52.000 --> 3:16:54.000]  I look at the picture, I look at the news, I see it.
[3:16:55.000 --> 3:16:56.000]  You know, it's up to you to decide-
[3:16:57.000 --> 3:17:02.000]  To be clear, they admit that Barbara Bush's mother did have a trust with Alistair Crowley.
[3:17:03.000 --> 3:17:07.000]  Absolutely, along with Marvin Pierce who is the owner of McCalls and Red Book Magazine.
[3:17:08.000 --> 3:17:10.000]  Well she went off without him and returned pregnant.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:13.000]  Yeah.
[3:17:13.000 --> 3:17:18.000]  I mean, it's admitted that Bill Clinton is a Rockefeller, that his mother was a prostitute and then that's come out.
[3:17:19.000 --> 3:17:22.000]  It's admitted that Rockefellers have secret breeding programs that are obsessed with that.
[3:17:23.000 --> 3:17:27.000]  Exactly, and if we believe this and we see this over and over again, then this isn't that far outside of the realms of possibility.
[3:17:28.000 --> 3:17:32.000]  And we can actually track this bloodline from the blowing up of King James at Parliament or the attempt to.
[3:17:33.000 --> 3:17:36.000]  All the way up to the presidents and up to George W. Bush today.
[3:17:39.000 --> 3:17:40.000]  This is crazy.
[3:17:40.000 --> 3:17:42.000]  Okay, have one more. Let me throw you one more.
[3:17:43.000 --> 3:17:50.000]  Anna Nicole Smith, okay, she was a seeming high-profile ritual goddess for the Brotherhood, much like Marilyn Monroe, James Manfield,
[3:17:51.000 --> 3:17:53.000]  that they were used in these high-profile rituals.
[3:17:54.000 --> 3:17:56.000]  No, no, no, it was Mansfield who really was in-
[3:17:58.000 --> 3:17:59.000]  She was in the Church of Satan.
[3:18:00.000 --> 3:18:01.000]  Yeah, I mean, they're there for that, but that's admitted, that's admitted.
[3:18:02.000 --> 3:18:05.000]  Absolutely, and George W. Bush is admittedly descended to Marilyn Monroe.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:08.000]  It was in Us Weekly Magazine, I don't know.
[3:18:08.000 --> 3:18:11.000]  And then Barack Obama is related to Cheney Ann Bush.
[3:18:12.000 --> 3:18:15.000]  Exactly, you see, we're looking at a huge globalist, capitalist family.
[3:18:16.000 --> 3:18:23.000]  What we find is now, Anna Nicole was being passed around in these different rituals and having sex with many, many people,
[3:18:24.000 --> 3:18:25.000]  one of which was Prince Frederick von Anhalt.
[3:18:26.000 --> 3:18:31.000]  And Prince Frederick von Anhalt was the one who stood before the whole public, it's in my video,
[3:18:32.000 --> 3:18:33.000]  and said, no, that child is mine.
[3:18:33.000 --> 3:18:39.000]  Do the dates, do the timing, she was having sex with me on a night that no one seems to remember.
[3:18:40.000 --> 3:18:47.000]  Now, if we look into Prince Frederick von Anhalt's lineage, we find that he is quite possibly a genetic experiment
[3:18:48.000 --> 3:18:52.000]  artificially inseminate Gretel Braun with Hitler's semen.
[3:18:53.000 --> 3:18:58.000]  Now, we know that Klauberg was the father of artificial insemination, Carl Klauberg,
[3:18:59.000 --> 3:19:00.000]  and that they had kept Hitler's semen.
[3:19:00.000 --> 3:19:03.000]  So, it's possible, right?
[3:19:04.000 --> 3:19:08.000]  But now, Prince Frederick von Anhalt's being a Hitler, being a Rothschild,
[3:19:09.000 --> 3:19:13.000]  would make Anna Nicole's baby a Rothschild, right, if he truly was the father as he says he is.
[3:19:14.000 --> 3:19:18.000]  Well, it goes back to the Greeks, though, that the prostitutes were at the temple, you'd go have sex with them there.
[3:19:19.000 --> 3:19:21.000]  This is all crazy. I know a lot of it can be documented, some of it can't.
[3:19:22.000 --> 3:19:27.000]  It's just so bizarre, ladies and gentlemen, we're getting into some of the really esoteric things here with our guests.
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:29.000]  We're going to skip this break for info-war.com listeners.
[3:19:30.000 --> 3:19:31.000]  Jim Newcomer from...
[3:19:32.000 --> 3:19:33.000]  Okay, we're going to cut that off. Go ahead.
[3:19:34.000 --> 3:19:40.000]  Let me just conclude that thought, because what we find now is the claimants for Anna Nicole's babies,
[3:19:41.000 --> 3:19:44.000]  of course, are Howard K. Stern and Larry Burkhead.
[3:19:45.000 --> 3:19:50.000]  But, of course, out of the blue comes Prince Frederick von Anhalt, who is the husband of Jaja Gabor,
[3:19:51.000 --> 3:19:53.000]  who is another rumored mind control slave for the media.
[3:19:53.000 --> 3:19:57.000]  And he honestly keeps her locked up in his mansion with a padlock.
[3:19:58.000 --> 3:19:59.000]  Jaja Gabor is not allowed out.
[3:20:00.000 --> 3:20:05.000]  Okay, so now we've got this guy connected with a former mind control slave, and now with a new mind control slave.
[3:20:06.000 --> 3:20:14.000]  Now, what is curious is when Anna Nicole died, well, before her death, I'm sorry, she was given over to Howard Marshall,
[3:20:15.000 --> 3:20:20.000]  who was a Nazi oil baron, had a million dollars, billion dollars in the bank,
[3:20:20.000 --> 3:20:27.000]  and he was married off, this is the old man that Anna Nicole was married to, 93 years old, I think he was when he married her,
[3:20:28.000 --> 3:20:30.000]  she was like 26, and he dies the very next year.
[3:20:31.000 --> 3:20:33.000]  But what this does is put his money into her lineage, right?
[3:20:34.000 --> 3:20:41.000]  But the will was left kind of open in the air,
[3:20:42.000 --> 3:20:46.000]  and even all of the lawyers I saw in the news trying to analyze it couldn't figure out who got the money.
[3:20:46.000 --> 3:20:49.000]  Who gets this oil tycoon, this Nazi oil tycoon's money?
[3:20:50.000 --> 3:20:54.000]  Well, it comes down to Daniel Lynn Smith, who is the daughter of Anna Nicole.
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:20:56.000]  And then notice how the son mysteriously died.
[3:20:57.000 --> 3:21:02.000]  Right, the son dies three days after the daughter's death, and you'll find that they're into the trinity of the threes,
[3:21:03.000 --> 3:21:11.000]  and so three days after the daughter's birth, Daniel Lynn's birth, the son Daniel Smith drops dead in the hospital in front of the baby.
[3:21:11.000 --> 3:21:20.000]  Then three months later, after the birth of the daughter, Anna Nicole drops dead in front of the baby, in Hollywood, Florida, that is.
[3:21:21.000 --> 3:21:24.000]  Now, we're looking at this ritually, this all makes sense.
[3:21:25.000 --> 3:21:30.000]  But what we find is that this daughter, this Daniel Lynn Smith, the daughter of Prince Frederick von Anhalt,
[3:21:31.000 --> 3:21:33.000]  is a direct descendant of the Rothschild bloodline through Hitler.
[3:21:34.000 --> 3:21:35.000]  And you've got these corrupt oil barons?
[3:21:35.000 --> 3:21:40.000]  Corrupt oil barons? And now has a billion dollars from a Nazi oil baron. Yes.
[3:21:41.000 --> 3:21:44.000]  What can you say? I mean, I have this database.
[3:21:45.000 --> 3:21:47.000]  No, I've looked up a lot of this and found a lot of what you're saying.
[3:21:48.000 --> 3:21:49.000]  I'm not saying you're lying or wrong about the rest.
[3:21:50.000 --> 3:21:51.000]  I just haven't looked into all of it, but it is a fact.
[3:21:52.000 --> 3:21:53.000]  And I've seen the documentation before.
[3:21:54.000 --> 3:21:58.000]  Maybe we can go over that a little bit more that Barbara Bush's mother did.
[3:21:58.000 --> 3:22:04.000]  That is where, for us to document, did run off for a time with Alistair Crowley and come back around that time pregnant.
[3:22:05.000 --> 3:22:10.000]  Absolutely. I have the news source linked on to thefremontv.com in the article on Anna Nicole Brittany in Mind Control.
[3:22:11.000 --> 3:22:13.000]  You can absolutely go and check it for yourself.
[3:22:14.000 --> 3:22:16.000]  But like I say, some of these things are hidden.
[3:22:17.000 --> 3:22:18.000]  Like, we can't prove Hitler's bloodline.
[3:22:19.000 --> 3:22:20.000]  We can say that it's most likely.
[3:22:21.000 --> 3:22:23.000]  Well, we know he had those records destroyed and that was in German newspapers.
[3:22:23.000 --> 3:22:27.000]  It was a big deal in German newspapers that he was a Rothschild mainstream newspapers.
[3:22:28.000 --> 3:22:29.000]  And then he had a bunch of people killed.
[3:22:30.000 --> 3:22:31.000]  And then we've got Walt Disney.
[3:22:32.000 --> 3:22:34.000]  And then he would only have sex with cousins and people, too.
[3:22:35.000 --> 3:22:36.000]  It was all about a bloodline there.
[3:22:37.000 --> 3:22:38.000]  That's the ancient Egyptian way.
[3:22:39.000 --> 3:22:40.000]  They always had sex with their sisters.
[3:22:41.000 --> 3:22:44.000]  That was one thing that I've tracked for so long to try to understand.
[3:22:45.000 --> 3:22:46.000]  And then they killed his first cousin, Gellie.
[3:22:47.000 --> 3:22:48.000]  She was going to speak out about it and they popped her.
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:58.000]  Yeah, anyone that comes forth and you'll see that what they'll do is they'll take the ones like Catesby and Percy that were involved in the gunpowder plot and they'll kill them on the spot.
[3:22:59.000 --> 3:23:04.000]  But then they'll bring someone like Guy Fox or in a case of Freemasonry or the Templars Jacques de Malay.
[3:23:05.000 --> 3:23:08.000]  They bring these people out as a symbol, as a fall guy, as Oswald was a fall guy.
[3:23:09.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  You know, they bring these men out when the true perpetrators of the event were hidden and killed, usually.
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:20.000]  You know, if you kill them off right away, then you don't have to worry about the conspiracy getting out.
[3:23:21.000 --> 3:23:22.000]  Well, they're a bunch of lunatics.
[3:23:23.000 --> 3:23:23.000]  I've been to Bohemian Grove.
[3:23:24.000 --> 3:23:26.000]  I've seen them do the rituals and so God knows what's really going on.
[3:23:27.000 --> 3:23:27.000]  But we're looking into it today.
[3:23:28.000 --> 3:23:29.000]  Here we go back to the full broadcast.
[3:23:29.000 --> 3:23:56.000]  Come, your masters of war, here to build the big guns, build to destroy, here to build the death planes, here to build all the bombs, here to hide behind walls, here to hide behind discs.
[3:23:56.000 --> 3:24:03.000]  I just don't want you to know I can see through your masks.
[3:24:03.000 --> 3:24:24.000]  You that never done nothing, would build to destroy, you play with my world, like it's your little toy, you put a gun in my hand.
[3:24:25.000 --> 3:24:26.000]  Sounds like Bob Dylan knows what's going on.
[3:24:27.000 --> 3:24:29.000]  He looks into all his lyrics, boy.
[3:24:30.000 --> 3:24:31.000]  It's pretty serious.
[3:24:31.000 --> 3:24:39.000]  Yeah, he was definitely one that was trying to move forward with the concepts of liberty and freedom and down with the understanding.
[3:24:40.000 --> 3:24:49.000]  I mean, once you get into that realm, once you're in the Hollywood music scene, you start to learn quickly who's in charge and who the filter is that allows people to rise to the top.
[3:24:49.000 --> 3:25:00.000]  And we find that right now, America is becoming so satanic in its music and its movement into this era of the dark hero.
[3:25:01.000 --> 3:25:06.000]  From the moment of Y2K, we have been moving into the era of the dark hero, like the latest film of Batman, The Dark Knight.
[3:25:07.000 --> 3:25:11.000]  These are the concepts they want to instill in us, vengeance, hate, aggression.
[3:25:11.000 --> 3:25:23.000]  And so they have used every form of media they have in order to instill this type of mind pattern programming into us of the age of the dark hero, the age of Horace, which was heralded by Bill Clinton in his Y2K stance when he said,
[3:25:24.000 --> 3:25:28.000]  it is a rising sun and they had the river's tames burnt to the speed of the sun.
[3:25:29.000 --> 3:25:31.000]  And as we discussed before, the capping of the Great Pyramid with gold.
[3:25:32.000 --> 3:25:34.000]  This is absolutely how they work.
[3:25:35.000 --> 3:25:36.000]  This is their enchantment, their spell.
[3:25:36.000 --> 3:25:42.000]  This is why people are dressing up as a V for Vendetta character V and going out and doing protest.
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:44.000]  You know, this is the power of Hollywood.
[3:25:45.000 --> 3:25:48.000]  If we consider when Jaws came out, the beaches were empty.
[3:25:49.000 --> 3:25:50.000]  Okay, Hollywood does have power.
[3:25:51.000 --> 3:25:53.000]  People were afraid to go to the beach after watching Jaws.
[3:25:54.000 --> 3:25:56.000]  I mean, it was complaints by everyone in Florida about that.
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:25:58.000]  That's the same hoax with Bin Laden.
[3:25:58.000 --> 3:26:05.000]  I mean, even if you believe it was real Arab attacks, 3,000 killed, you still got a better chance of being struck by lightning or many times chance of drowning or car wreck.
[3:26:06.000 --> 3:26:08.000]  But it's that unseen primitive fear.
[3:26:09.000 --> 3:26:14.000]  And then don't worry, the black wings of the new old order will save you from the evil Jaws, Dunon.
[3:26:15.000 --> 3:26:16.000]  Now we look at their symbol.
[3:26:17.000 --> 3:26:19.000]  Their symbol is the double headed eagle with one body.
[3:26:20.000 --> 3:26:21.000]  That's your dad's Masonic ring, let me say.
[3:26:22.000 --> 3:26:24.000]  So we're looking at very much the Hegelian dialectic.
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:31.000]  The idea that they are two forces opposed, but they actually are one body.
[3:26:32.000 --> 3:26:40.000]  And this is where we will constantly be caught off guard if we allow them to promote the ideas of, oh, these are the bad guys and we're the good guys.
[3:26:41.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  So we've got to realize that it's us.
[3:26:43.000 --> 3:26:47.000]  It's us, the people right now, right here, all of you listening to us that are the good forces.
[3:26:48.000 --> 3:26:50.000]  And they're not going to give us a good force to fight themselves.
[3:26:51.000 --> 3:26:52.000]  They're just not going to do it.
[3:26:52.000 --> 3:27:00.000]  What we're looking at is us having to step forward and not relying on them to solve all our problems for us.
[3:27:01.000 --> 3:27:04.000]  We need to step away from this esoteric order and start to promote ourselves.
[3:27:05.000 --> 3:27:10.000]  And that's what we are doing at this point now in talking with all of you.
[3:27:11.000 --> 3:27:15.000]  Tell the viewers that are watching on PrismPlanet.tv right now about your dad's ring.
[3:27:15.000 --> 3:27:27.000]  Yeah, what we're looking at, definitely, you've got the double-headed eagle going on with this concept of the Hegelian dialectic, two opposing forces, one body.
[3:27:28.000 --> 3:27:29.000]  It's also a symbol of the God Janus.
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:32.000]  Looking forward and backward.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:34.000]  Yeah, looking forward and backward.
[3:27:35.000 --> 3:27:40.000]  And what we'll see here as well is the concept of the Hebrew, the capitalism being incorporated into it.
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:47.000]  Because what you'll see there is the Hebrew letter R, which is Resh, which is in capitalism, a symbol of the sun.
[3:27:48.000 --> 3:27:54.000]  And so, just so that you are, you know, well-informed on this topic, they are practicing capitalism.
[3:27:55.000 --> 3:27:58.000]  Albert Pike states this over 70 times in morals and dogma.
[3:27:59.000 --> 3:28:00.000]  But the average Mason tells you no, because they're a poor Mason.
[3:28:01.000 --> 3:28:03.000]  And because they don't know a thing, yes, that is absolutely right.
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:06.000]  Even the worshipful masters aren't certain why they're doing their rituals.
[3:28:06.000 --> 3:28:09.000]  And you have to want to know. And they'll tell you that too.
[3:28:10.000 --> 3:28:15.000]  And they'll also tell you that they're going to lie to you about it until you figure it out for yourself, because that's the way they act.
[3:28:16.000 --> 3:28:18.000]  And that's the world we live in.
[3:28:19.000 --> 3:28:22.000]  Show folks on camera, right here is the camera shot, some of the different features of this ring.
[3:28:23.000 --> 3:28:26.000]  Okay, so if you can see that there, can you see that?
[3:28:27.000 --> 3:28:31.000]  That is the Hebrew letter R, which is a symbol of the sun in capitalism.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:40.000]  And then, of course, you have your 32nd degree, which is shown up on the other side, which makes you a high-level Scottish right Freemasonry.
[3:28:41.000 --> 3:28:42.000]  So you have the York right and the Scottish right.
[3:28:43.000 --> 3:28:54.000]  Now, it's curious now, Pope Ratzinger, or Benedict as he's known now, back when he was Cardinal Ratzinger, was formally opposed against Freemasonry in secret societies.
[3:28:54.000 --> 3:29:01.000]  He put out papal statements saying that he is standing in opposition of any secret societies that they are against God.
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:08.000]  And that if you are a member of the masons, you are excommunicated from the Catholic Church.
[3:29:09.000 --> 3:29:13.000]  But now he has come forth and said, well, you know what, those Templars, they were okay.
[3:29:14.000 --> 3:29:16.000]  We're all right with the Templars and their worship about it.
[3:29:17.000 --> 3:29:19.000]  Yeah, they did that a couple of months ago. Stay there. Let's keep talking about it.
[3:29:20.000 --> 3:29:22.000]  Continue. I don't want to interrupt you. Keep going.
[3:29:22.000 --> 3:29:30.000]  But I just want to tell the network, I am me, the callers, so we can, oh, I've got them on screen, Doug, Joe, John, Mike, Ted, and others.
[3:29:31.000 --> 3:29:36.000]  Okay, so in going for people, you've gotten to Ratzinger saying the Templars are now wonderful folks and we apologize.
[3:29:37.000 --> 3:29:38.000]  Yeah, yeah, we apologize.
[3:29:39.000 --> 3:29:49.000]  Yes, and what we'll find is that, well, now as I start to look at these encoded dates and encoded numbers, now 9-11 is not a date per se for them.
[3:29:49.000 --> 3:29:54.000]  It is a number. It is a symbol of Luciferianism, which I could get into if we had time.
[3:29:55.000 --> 3:30:01.000]  But what I'm constantly looking for are these dates, these numbers, to try and figure out their next move.
[3:30:02.000 --> 3:30:09.000]  And when I noticed that the Twin Towers and the Pentagon both had Masonic Cornerstone lying ceremonies on 9-11 in their respective building years,
[3:30:10.000 --> 3:30:16.000]  I started looking for other coded dates and I found the White House having its Masonic Cornerstone on 10-13.
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:22.000]  And now 10-13 is the infamous Friday the 13th of the death of the Templars.
[3:30:23.000 --> 3:30:30.000]  It was Friday the 13th, 1307, when the Pope and the King came together and said the Templars need to be eradicated.
[3:30:31.000 --> 3:30:35.000]  Now, the Templars are a very interesting study and would take some time to get into.
[3:30:36.000 --> 3:30:38.000]  But what I'm looking at right now is the symbols.
[3:30:39.000 --> 3:30:44.000]  And of course, 10-13 is the date on the White House Cornerstone, but it's also Chris Carter's production company.
[3:30:44.000 --> 3:30:48.000]  And I don't know, you talked with Chris Carter and did he say that whole 9-11 was just one?
[3:30:49.000 --> 3:30:56.000]  No, no, I talked to Dean Hanglin, one of the stars in both the TV shows, Loan Government and X-Files.
[3:30:57.000 --> 3:31:00.000]  Now, the CIA would come plant stories on him, yes. He talked to Chris Carter.
[3:31:01.000 --> 3:31:06.000]  Okay, because did they feel that giving away the whole 9-11 scenario was just a lucky guess or what?
[3:31:07.000 --> 3:31:12.000]  And not just a scenario that a criminal group was doing within the government as a pretext for a police state and launch wars in Afghanistan.
[3:31:12.000 --> 3:31:13.000]  Exactly.
[3:31:14.000 --> 3:31:16.000]  And they used drills to make the rest of the government stand down.
[3:31:17.000 --> 3:31:18.000]  So they had every aspect in there.
[3:31:19.000 --> 3:31:20.000]  Total coincidence, it's nothing.
[3:31:21.000 --> 3:31:27.000]  Kind of like 7-7, the government ran drills of the exact same targets being attacked at the exact same time.
[3:31:28.000 --> 3:31:29.000]  Yes.
[3:31:30.000 --> 3:31:31.000]  The exact same places.
[3:31:32.000 --> 3:31:39.000]  Well, Chris Carter's production company is 10-13, which is the infamous day that Jacques de Malay was murdered or burnt at the stake by the Pope and the King of France.
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:43.000]  So this is a date that I'm currently watching.
[3:31:44.000 --> 3:31:48.000]  And when I was watching 9-11, I was watching it for three years.
[3:31:49.000 --> 3:31:50.000]  I watched it all throughout the Clinton era.
[3:31:51.000 --> 3:31:56.000]  And the reason I was watching the date 9-11 was because I knew that this Patriot Act, this Homeland Security Department, was coming up.
[3:31:57.000 --> 3:31:59.000]  And I knew that it came every early October.
[3:32:00.000 --> 3:32:01.000]  And I knew they were going to need time for public reactions.
[3:32:02.000 --> 3:32:03.000]  So it happened in the middle of September.
[3:32:03.000 --> 3:32:09.000]  I picked the date 9-11 because that was the day HW had announced the New World Order for the first time publicly.
[3:32:10.000 --> 3:32:11.000]  And I know how they are about ritual dates.
[3:32:12.000 --> 3:32:18.000]  So it was 1990, 1999-11 when HW announced the New World Order for the first time publicly.
[3:32:19.000 --> 3:32:24.000]  And so I used that as my key, knowing that it was strategic and esoteric.
[3:32:25.000 --> 3:32:29.000]  So when we're looking at the picture, we can't simply look at what would be militarily strategic,
[3:32:29.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  but we must also look at their symbols and their dates and their timings.
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:33:02.000]  We're coming back a lot to everybody right now.
[3:33:02.000 --> 3:33:05.000]  All right, I want to take some phone calls a bit all over the map.
[3:33:06.000 --> 3:33:11.000]  But Freeman, from your studying, from your perspective, your unique perspective,
[3:33:12.000 --> 3:33:18.000]  the power structure, because they fool us with Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Chinese, German, Mexican.
[3:33:19.000 --> 3:33:25.000]  They confuse us because it's the same, whether it's the Jews or the Kabbalistic system or the Druids.
[3:33:25.000 --> 3:33:31.000]  Similar, getting into numerology, getting into all of the same gods, different names.
[3:33:32.000 --> 3:33:37.000]  It all goes together, no matter whether it's South Islanders and areas they dug up from 5,000 years ago
[3:33:38.000 --> 3:33:40.000]  or whether it's Druids 1,000 years ago, 2,000 years ago in Europe.
[3:33:41.000 --> 3:33:44.000]  4,000, 5,000, 10,000 years ago, it's the same thing over and over again.
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:49.000]  It's a global system with the sciences that were developed that we call the sciences today.
[3:33:49.000 --> 3:33:55.000]  Growing out of that secret universities to guard the knowledge, going back to Egypt,
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:58.000]  supposedly taught to them by the gods.
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  And then they love it that, like they divide us between Democrat and Republican,
[3:34:04.000 --> 3:34:08.000]  they divide us between, you know, saying, no, it's all run by Nazis, no, it's all run by Catholics,
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:13.000]  no, it's all run by Jews, no, it's all run by, over and over again, obsessing on this.
[3:34:13.000 --> 3:34:19.000]  But you see Pat Robertson, the Protestant white guy with the black radical Al Sharper saying,
[3:34:20.000 --> 3:34:23.000]  global government tax, you know, environmental tax, you know, they're all together.
[3:34:24.000 --> 3:34:26.000]  You see the football league come out for the global tax.
[3:34:27.000 --> 3:34:30.000]  NFL, it's all the same system now.
[3:34:31.000 --> 3:34:33.000]  They're all really showing us now they're unified.
[3:34:34.000 --> 3:34:36.000]  And so from your research, what is the global power structure?
[3:34:37.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  Break that down for us.
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:46.000]  Well, the global power structure lies in these in these city states that we control religion and economics and military.
[3:34:47.000 --> 3:34:52.000]  They have been working towards this, their so-called utopia for quite some time.
[3:34:53.000 --> 3:34:58.000]  If you study freemasonic writings and studies, then they take you back to Atlantis.
[3:34:59.000 --> 3:35:02.000]  They take you back to times anterior to the Temple of Solomon.
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:10.000]  These people have been, well, you know, it depends on how far you want to go really,
[3:35:11.000 --> 3:35:17.000]  because as we're looking at Masonic ritual, okay, we're trying to stick to their main power structure,
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:20.000]  but we have to understand where they're coming from.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  As you mentioned, the rituals of Hiram Abif as we get to the Ark of the Covenant.
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  Now, do we believe in this?
[3:35:29.000 --> 3:35:30.000]  What do we think of the Ark of the Covenant?
[3:35:30.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  Now, when you're in a Masonic ritual, when you're doing the acting out of Hiram Abif,
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:39.000]  who was the architect of Solomon's Temple by Masonic standards,
[3:35:40.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  we find that they are, this temple was built to house the Ark of the Covenant.
[3:35:45.000 --> 3:35:49.000]  Now, if we look into the Ark of the Covenant now just perfectly, just looked at plainly,
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:54.000]  the Ark of the Covenant was the first weapon of mass destruction given to mankind by God.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:58.000]  That's what the Israelites would use it for.
[3:35:58.000 --> 3:35:59.000]  They'd hold it out in front of them.
[3:36:00.000 --> 3:36:01.000]  That's what the Bible says.
[3:36:02.000 --> 3:36:04.000]  Right, so it's, you know, how far do you want to go with this?
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:12.000]  Now, what they had there was the power of God, as they knew it, what they would call it.
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:16.000]  And what this power was known as is the Shakana, or the Shakana.
[3:36:17.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  And this is the same term used with infremasonry when you're asked, what is the Shakana?
[3:36:22.000 --> 3:36:26.000]  It is the cloud of brotherhood that surrounds the Masonic altar, just as a veil.
[3:36:26.000 --> 3:36:31.000]  Yeah, well, and so this is the Holy of Holies, their communication with God.
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:36.000]  Now, I take this back and I look at these things as high technology.
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:45.000]  I do, from Masonic studies, from their studies, they believe that there is a high technological advance race in the ancient past
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  that was wiped out and is now coming back to fruition.
[3:36:49.000 --> 3:36:54.000]  To them, America and this new global elite is the new Atlantis, exactly.
[3:36:54.000 --> 3:37:04.000]  So, they are the ones that are studying UFOs, ancient astronauts, the high technology of the ancient past.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  If you start getting into these studies, you're going to constantly come to a freemason that is giving you the information.
[3:37:12.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  That is what they are interested in.
[3:37:14.000 --> 3:37:19.000]  So, for me, this story goes way back into ancient past and comes up to fourth today.
[3:37:19.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  Now, Alex, what am I to do when a big flying V-shaped craft flies over my head?
[3:37:27.000 --> 3:37:29.000]  I tried to film it, I apologize, I don't have it on film.
[3:37:30.000 --> 3:37:32.000]  Well, we know they have a lot of advanced technologies the government does.
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:38.000]  There's no doubt, I mean, for almost 20 years they kept the B-2 Bombers secret when they rolled it out in 87.
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  Exactly, and this was absolutely an anti-gravity craft that I saw.
[3:37:42.000 --> 3:37:44.000]  So, who are the people in these areas?
[3:37:45.000 --> 3:37:47.000]  These are the cult orders once again.
[3:37:47.000 --> 3:37:54.000]  Well, it's admitted that NASA was founded by a bunch of different cults and Crowley's people were involved and JPL and all of that.
[3:37:55.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  We're going to get into that next time you are on with us, Freeman, because I need to go to some calls here.
[3:37:59.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  I'm sure they'll be all over the map, but it is awesome having you with us. Stay with us for the calls.
[3:38:03.000 --> 3:38:08.000]  freementv.com links to that up on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[3:38:09.000 --> 3:38:11.000]  Doug in Tennessee, you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:13.000]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[3:38:13.000 --> 3:38:16.000]  I've been a listener for about two and a half years.
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  My wife and I have distributed hundreds of your DVDs and I just wanted to come compliment you on Truth Rising.
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  It's a very moving and powerful film.
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:29.000]  Thank you.
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:34.000]  I wanted to make a point about Romans 13, the controversy over Romans 13.
[3:38:35.000 --> 3:38:39.000]  It's funny, I just clicked on infowars, a good article written by B.L. Beard about that.
[3:38:39.000 --> 3:38:42.000]  It just happened to click on that right when you said that.
[3:38:43.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  Go ahead.
[3:38:45.000 --> 3:38:48.000]  Well, in Christine Ebersole's speech was really great in Truth Rising.
[3:38:49.000 --> 3:38:53.000]  I thought that was one of the high points of the film and she was talking about authority and truth.
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:59.000]  I just want all the Bible believers out there to realize that our authority is the rule of law in America
[3:39:00.000 --> 3:39:05.000]  and the Constitution of the United States is our authority and that's the authority we are to submit to.
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  And that's what Romans 13 is talking about.
[3:39:09.000 --> 3:39:13.000]  It's talking about lawful government and that's the authority we submit to.
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  And this elite, these criminals, these people that Freeman is describing here are satanic.
[3:39:22.000 --> 3:39:23.000]  They have taken over our government.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:26.000]  They are the ones that aren't submitting to authority.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  They are our enemies and we must stand against them.
[3:39:30.000 --> 3:39:31.000]  Well, they are the revolutionaries.
[3:39:31.000 --> 3:39:35.000]  They have overturned the human order and in fact they admitted it was a cult taking the French Revolution.
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  They wanted to have a 10-day week, no rest.
[3:39:39.000 --> 3:39:40.000]  They wanted to change the months of the year.
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:42.000]  Change the calendar, yeah.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:49.000]  And so I just, I don't know why this is complicated for Bible believers.
[3:39:50.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  The authority in our country is the rule of law and we submit to the Constitution and the rule of law unlike our enemies.
[3:39:58.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  And we must stand up against them.
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:05.000]  I feel that your show has taken a qualitative leap forward in the last couple of months, Alex.
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:11.000]  It's just a great resource and inspiration every day to us.
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  Thank you for your show and God bless you.
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  Things are getting a lot darker so I'm getting a lot more focused here.
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:19.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Pennsylvania.
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:21.000]  You're on the air, Joe.
[3:40:22.000 --> 3:40:23.000]  Good afternoon.
[3:40:24.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  Alex, how are you doing?
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  Good, sir.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  I have a question.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  I apologize.
[3:40:31.000 --> 3:40:33.000]  I just woke up a couple of weeks ago.
[3:40:34.000 --> 3:40:45.000]  But since I have awakened, I have discovered a lot of disturbing things going on in my country such as the FEMA concentration camps.
[3:40:46.000 --> 3:40:52.000]  All these executive orders giving the government permission to basically turn us into slaves.
[3:40:52.000 --> 3:40:57.000]  But again, that's really lawless. Somebody can claim that the king and claim they can eat barbecued babies on the White House lawn.
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:40:59.000]  It doesn't make it so.
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:01.000]  Yes.
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:09.000]  I was wondering if you were aware of the Homeland Terrorism Preparedness Bill that is going through the House of Representatives.
[3:41:10.000 --> 3:41:11.000]  Yes.
[3:41:12.000 --> 3:41:13.000]  H.R. 8791.
[3:41:14.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  Yes.
[3:41:16.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  Well, there's a little clip about it on YouTube.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:23.000]  And it's pretty scary when you think about one of his last sentences.
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  A lot of it, he says, is classified.
[3:41:27.000 --> 3:41:40.000]  But one of the things that he does say, Representative John Holler, Pennsylvania 12th District, is that also, that bill also gives them the ability to draft a new bill of rights.
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  Has this bill passed?
[3:41:43.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  Not that I'm aware of.
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:48.000]  Listen, they're announcing, they're going to videotape everybody when they basically take tests.
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:53.000]  They're announcing anybody who's in any type of real estate, it will be fingerprinted as a criminal.
[3:41:54.000 --> 3:41:57.000]  They're announcing they're trying to pass two bills where CPS, as we told you, they do in Europe now.
[3:41:58.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  And when someone's born, they come to your house and they check you.
[3:42:01.000 --> 3:42:02.000]  You know, guilty.
[3:42:03.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  We're all guilty.
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:06.000]  We all have spies watching us, controlling us.
[3:42:07.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  I mean, it's all happening.
[3:42:09.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  They are making their move.
[3:42:11.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  They're getting ready to shut down the web piece by piece.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:14.000]  What's the name of that YouTube clip and I'll pull it up.
[3:42:15.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  Bill, we should all be scared of.
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  Okay, A, Bill.
[3:42:20.000 --> 3:42:21.000]  No, the bill.
[3:42:22.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  The bill we should all be scared of.
[3:42:24.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  The bill we should all be scared of.
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:35.000]  It's kind of good to do this on air, teach people to go look stuff up.
[3:42:36.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  Yeah, it's a minute and 46 seconds.
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  Minute and 47, the ones I got, you know, I'm going to go ahead and play it for you right now.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  Hold on one moment.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  Here we go.
[3:42:45.000 --> 3:42:46.000]  Go ahead and play this for folks.
[3:42:47.000 --> 3:42:48.000]  I got to get a new audio feed and have this one's getting dirtier and dirtier.
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  Here it is.
[3:42:50.000 --> 3:42:50.000]  This is the clip.
[3:42:51.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  Congress shall now vote for approval of HR 8791.
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  And of course, I'm glad you brought that up because that is from the onion.
[3:43:00.000 --> 3:43:01.000]  And that's the one I thought it was.
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:03.000]  And that's why I'm glad that we pulled that up.
[3:43:03.000 --> 3:43:07.000]  And so I am aware of similar bills that do things like that.
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  And so what the onion does is now distributed in most areas of the country, including Austin, Texas, New York, D.C., San Francisco, L.A., Chicago, is you can go to the John Warren Defense Authorization Act that says the presidents above the Congress.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  And he's saying he won't let Homeland Security Board who are co-equal to the president even see the plan.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:34.000]  We have the cover sheet.
[3:43:35.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  And clearly it says he's a dictator or whoever the president happens to be.
[3:43:38.000 --> 3:43:42.000]  We have the Military Commissions Act saying they can secretly grab U.S. citizens and arrest us.
[3:43:43.000 --> 3:43:44.000]  And we have the torture memos.
[3:43:44.000 --> 3:43:53.000]  We have all these other pieces of legislation, executive orders about work brigades, Houston Chronicle and FEMA camps.
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:44:01.000]  And then what happens is things like the onion give cover to that because then it turns it all into a big joke.
[3:44:02.000 --> 3:44:05.000]  And then people say, oh, I heard about that.
[3:44:06.000 --> 3:44:07.000]  That was in the onion.
[3:44:07.000 --> 3:44:14.000]  Instead of, I mean, I was just watching the hearings today where they were reading the White House saying, no, we don't let White House people be subpoenaed by Congress.
[3:44:15.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  I mean, Nixon tried that and they were about to impeach him.
[3:44:17.000 --> 3:44:21.000]  And then they quote Nixon saying the president can do something and it's not illegal if it is illegal.
[3:44:22.000 --> 3:44:23.000]  And they said, no, he was wrong, then he's wrong now.
[3:44:24.000 --> 3:44:28.000]  And you have the White House saying they're above the law and they can do whatever they want.
[3:44:29.000 --> 3:44:30.000]  And again, they're setting these precedents now.
[3:44:31.000 --> 3:44:32.000]  This is bipartisan.
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:40.000]  And so, sir, I appreciate your call, but again, it's things like Nasera, the National Economic Restabilization Act.
[3:44:41.000 --> 3:44:42.000]  Not real, but around for 12 years.
[3:44:43.000 --> 3:44:44.000]  Every day I have to tell people it's not real and they get mad at me.
[3:44:45.000 --> 3:44:47.000]  There's not a secret group in the government that saves you and everything's really okay.
[3:44:48.000 --> 3:44:54.000]  You know, there's just so many hoaxes out there that end up, you know, I mean, I'll talk about something as long as there's some evidence to it.
[3:44:55.000 --> 3:44:59.000]  Like, it sounds crazy that the elite are doing rituals and it sounded crazy 10 years ago.
[3:44:59.000 --> 3:45:03.000]  We had Tex Mars on saying Madonna's doing rituals, Kabbalistic rituals.
[3:45:04.000 --> 3:45:05.000]  And he wrote books about it, newsletters.
[3:45:06.000 --> 3:45:08.000]  And then now for three years, he's been saying, I do Kabbalistic rituals.
[3:45:09.000 --> 3:45:11.000]  And I've been doing it for years and now I'm telling you.
[3:45:12.000 --> 3:45:17.000]  Or it's crazy to, you know, to report on these type things, but it's real.
[3:45:18.000 --> 3:45:20.000]  It's crazy to say I snuck in Bohemian Grove and got video of them doing this.
[3:45:21.000 --> 3:45:24.000]  And the Grove admits I snuck in and is mad I did it in TV programs.
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:29.000]  They've been, you know, talked to and they've said the one that air on Trio Network, but people still deny I even got that footage.
[3:45:30.000 --> 3:45:32.000]  People say that isn't real when the Grove admits that's real.
[3:45:33.000 --> 3:45:36.000]  So, you know, that's the problem with this background of this info that's out there.
[3:45:37.000 --> 3:45:38.000]  That's exactly right.
[3:45:39.000 --> 3:45:40.000]  Yeah, John in Florida, go ahead, you're on the air.
[3:45:43.000 --> 3:45:44.000]  Go ahead, John.
[3:45:45.000 --> 3:45:50.000]  Hey, I just want to touch base and figure out what are the, you know, I kind of grew up in this thing.
[3:45:50.000 --> 3:45:56.000]  I was not dropped out of high school because I felt like I was being programmed and a lot of them are doing.
[3:45:57.000 --> 3:46:01.000]  How do we unprogram our minds once we become aware that they're doing it?
[3:46:02.000 --> 3:46:03.000]  Sure, to clarify, I didn't drop out of high school.
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:06.000]  I quit college because I was total program and there wasn't any feel like it.
[3:46:07.000 --> 3:46:13.000]  It was just my God, I'm paying to be just, just sophomore level, you know, open brainwashing.
[3:46:14.000 --> 3:46:16.000]  I mean, you're paying to go to a reeducation camp.
[3:46:16.000 --> 3:46:19.000]  That's why you hear them say education, education, education, that's too dumb of you down.
[3:46:20.000 --> 3:46:22.000]  We've had the former head of policy department of education on about that.
[3:46:23.000 --> 3:46:24.000]  But sure, I mean, what's your point?
[3:46:25.000 --> 3:46:26.000]  I mean, I take your point, anything else you want to add?
[3:46:27.000 --> 3:46:29.000]  Well, what I'm saying is how do we unprogram our minds?
[3:46:30.000 --> 3:46:38.000]  I mean, when we get something like 9-11 where originally maybe we might have accepted it and then now we know it's a lie and then our mind is constantly going at each other.
[3:46:39.000 --> 3:46:40.000]  How do we get over that barrier?
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:44.000]  Because there's so many things that we're told one thing and then it's something else.
[3:46:44.000 --> 3:46:49.000]  Until, until you just learn to accept lies and get mad at people that point out you were lied to.
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:50.000]  Yeah.
[3:46:51.000 --> 3:46:55.000]  Well, what you find also is that you'll go through the different stages of grief that you find that when you find you're dying.
[3:46:56.000 --> 3:46:59.000]  Because learning this stuff is very similar to dying or knowing that you're going to die.
[3:47:00.000 --> 3:47:01.000]  The old lie, the old mindset dies.
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:02.000]  Yeah.
[3:47:03.000 --> 3:47:04.000]  And so you will go through all these different stages.
[3:47:05.000 --> 3:47:05.000]  Denial.
[3:47:06.000 --> 3:47:09.000]  Grief and anger until you finally get to acceptance.
[3:47:09.000 --> 3:47:13.000]  And once you get through these stages of grief, then you will find your path.
[3:47:14.000 --> 3:47:15.000]  You'll find your way through this.
[3:47:16.000 --> 3:47:16.000]  All right.
[3:47:17.000 --> 3:47:17.000]  Well, God bless you, God.
[3:47:18.000 --> 3:47:18.000]  Take it easy.
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:19.000]  Thank you.
[3:47:20.000 --> 3:47:28.000]  We're going to take Mike and Ted's calls in the final segment and we're going to talk behind the scenes from FullWars.com listeners in the three minute break that's coming up and let you finish up Freeman.
[3:47:28.000 --> 3:47:40.000]  Before I do that, I want to thank some of our sponsors that have made this radio broadcast possible.
[3:47:41.000 --> 3:47:43.000]  One of them is an amazing atmospheric water filter.
[3:47:44.000 --> 3:47:48.000]  You don't need to hook up to the city water supply or go to a pond or a lake or a well.
[3:47:48.000 --> 3:47:57.000]  This water system has been around for more than a decade, big company puts it out and I've seen these corporations and homes and really marveled at them.
[3:47:58.000 --> 3:48:01.000]  It has five filters in it, but they're very easy to maintenance and clean every few months.
[3:48:02.000 --> 3:48:03.000]  It just takes water out of the air.
[3:48:04.000 --> 3:48:06.000]  So there's very little in it to begin with, but it goes through UV.
[3:48:07.000 --> 3:48:07.000]  You name it.
[3:48:08.000 --> 3:48:16.000]  Just go to AkolaBlue.com, AkolaBlue.com and find out more about them or go to infowars.com if you forget the name of the website and you'll see a banner for AkolaBlue.
[3:48:16.000 --> 3:48:26.000]  Just remember AkolaBlue and you can check out their amazing units and we also sell burkeys of course at infowars.com if you want the classic gravity filter.
[3:48:27.000 --> 3:48:32.000]  We sell the British burkeys on our website, infowars.com, the best gravity filter out there if you have water.
[3:48:32.000 --> 3:48:46.000]  But for somebody who's got solar panels or if you're in an emergency or just power in your house, this is a system that makes 7.5 gallons a day in normal weather, humidity, but in a desert more than two gallons a day.
[3:48:47.000 --> 3:48:52.000]  I mean, this would keep three or four people alive in a desert or maybe even more.
[3:48:53.000 --> 3:48:53.000]  What's two and a half gallons?
[3:48:54.000 --> 3:48:55.000]  I mean, that's a lot of water.
[3:48:55.000 --> 3:49:03.000]  So that's three or four people. I mean, our problem here with the one we got in the office is that all of us drinking it can't drink it down each day.
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:07.000]  It keeps filling up and it's just an amazing system.
[3:49:08.000 --> 3:49:11.000]  AkolaBlue.com or 1-866-585-4044.
[3:49:12.000 --> 3:49:15.000]  1-866-585-4044 AkolaBlue.com.
[3:49:16.000 --> 3:49:18.000]  1-866-585-4044.
[3:49:18.000 --> 3:49:26.000]  And another fine sponsor, eFoodsDirect, eFoodsDirect is the longest continually operating storeable foods company in the nation.
[3:49:27.000 --> 3:49:29.000]  J. Michael Stevens Group is the company.
[3:49:30.000 --> 3:49:31.000]  Steve Shank is the owner.
[3:49:32.000 --> 3:49:36.000]  I bought storeable food from them four times, kept two of the supplies, gave the other to family.
[3:49:37.000 --> 3:49:41.000]  It's just an amazing, high quality food at a very low price, freeze dried or dehydrated.
[3:49:41.000 --> 3:49:47.000]  So it fits in very small areas, lasts more than 10 years in climate control, technically could be 20 something, but we like to say more than 10.
[3:49:48.000 --> 3:49:51.000]  And 10 in non-climate control, meaning in a hot garage or something.
[3:49:52.000 --> 3:49:54.000]  Give them a call 1-800-409-5633.
[3:49:55.000 --> 3:50:00.000]  eFoodsDirect.com on the web, Big Fat Banners, the top of MFallWars.com and PrismPlanet.com.
[3:50:01.000 --> 3:50:02.000]  That's 800-409-5633.
[3:50:03.000 --> 3:50:04.000]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[3:50:04.000 --> 3:50:10.000]  And you can also, when you call the J. Michael Stevens Group, get a free audio CD about what they do.
[3:50:11.000 --> 3:50:13.000]  Get a free brochure, 1-800-409-5633 or watch it all.
[3:50:14.000 --> 3:50:15.000]  They've got videos, CDs, you name it.
[3:50:16.000 --> 3:50:18.000]  Online, audios at eFoodsDirect.com.
[3:50:19.000 --> 3:50:21.000]  We're going to talk with Freeman behind the scenes for MFallWars.com.
[3:50:22.000 --> 3:50:23.000]  Stream listeners for everybody else.
[3:50:24.000 --> 3:50:25.000]  We'll be back in three minutes with some final calls. Stay with us.
[3:50:25.000 --> 3:50:35.000]  Okay, Freeman, we got three minutes left here for all the big audience on the web and the folks that ripped this off PrismPlanet.tv and put it all over YouTube and everywhere else.
[3:50:36.000 --> 3:50:37.000]  We appreciate them.
[3:50:38.000 --> 3:50:39.000]  But the high quality at PrismPlanet.tv, you want to thank those members.
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:41.000]  You've got about three minutes.
[3:50:42.000 --> 3:50:43.000]  Talk about anything you want.
[3:50:44.000 --> 3:50:45.000]  We're coming back and taking some final calls.
[3:50:46.000 --> 3:50:47.000]  All right.
[3:50:48.000 --> 3:50:51.000]  Well, I'll tell you first off, you know, my Anna Nicole Brittany, Mind Control article was already repositioned over to the World Wide Web 2.
[3:50:51.000 --> 3:50:56.000]  If you look in the URL of that article, you'll see where it says www2.
[3:50:57.000 --> 3:50:58.000]  I don't know.
[3:50:59.000 --> 3:51:01.000]  It's the only article that they did that they switched over to the World Wide Web 2.
[3:51:02.000 --> 3:51:03.000]  I don't know what that is.
[3:51:04.000 --> 3:51:07.000]  I've been seeing that pop up on a lot of websites, www2.
[3:51:08.000 --> 3:51:09.000]  Yeah.
[3:51:10.000 --> 3:51:11.000]  And it's the only article of mine, the Anna Nicole Brittany one.
[3:51:12.000 --> 3:51:13.000]  I mean, how would somebody get into your website and change that?
[3:51:14.000 --> 3:51:15.000]  Google sent me.
[3:51:16.000 --> 3:51:17.000]  I don't know.
[3:51:18.000 --> 3:51:19.000]  It just changed.
[3:51:19.000 --> 3:51:20.000]  Yeah, I don't know.
[3:51:21.000 --> 3:51:32.000]  Now, what I see coming, Alex, is as I watch their movement into this new paradigm of science as we're dealing with things like harp and weather modification.
[3:51:33.000 --> 3:51:39.000]  I mean, China says that they're going to be shooting some rockets up and, you know, missiles up into the atmosphere to keep the rain off the Olympics.
[3:51:40.000 --> 3:51:45.000]  We're looking at an area where now these men seem to have the godlike powers.
[3:51:45.000 --> 3:51:53.000]  They have this ability to generate storms, earthquakes, floods, control weather in ways of heating the ionosphere.
[3:51:54.000 --> 3:52:02.000]  And so what I see them doing, and not to mention that V-shaped craft I spotted, is to bring about this Armageddon script.
[3:52:03.000 --> 3:52:05.000]  And they want to bring about the big show.
[3:52:06.000 --> 3:52:13.000]  I mean, the bigger show than 9-11 ever was, a global-sized show that brings us into this concept of Armageddon.
[3:52:13.000 --> 3:52:17.000]  And then will bring us into the ideas of what they want to bring forth.
[3:52:18.000 --> 3:52:33.000]  And so putting themselves into positions of power through another global false flag event, which would incorporate weather patterns, earthquakes, and things that most people don't realize they have control over, or at least can manipulate.
[3:52:34.000 --> 3:52:39.000]  So this is what I see coming down the pipe, is this what I call an Armageddon script.
[3:52:39.000 --> 3:52:47.000]  A Project Bluebeam, sort of, only with bigger, even more ramifications than simple extraterrestrials.
[3:52:50.000 --> 3:52:56.000]  The problem is that people aren't aware of these powers. They aren't aware of HAARP. They aren't aware of the difference.
[3:52:57.000 --> 3:53:00.000]  And clearly they've been given the green light, because I don't get into all this stuff, but I know they believe in it.
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:06.000]  Because now you have top astronauts coming out and telling newspapers, oh yeah, we met with aliens, it's all real.
[3:53:06.000 --> 3:53:10.000]  You have the Pope saying it's real. But then we're still not supposed to talk about it over cooks.
[3:53:11.000 --> 3:53:15.000]  And you've got all these governments saying it's real now. It's like they're getting us ready for something, and I think it's going to be staged.
[3:53:16.000 --> 3:53:21.000]  These guys are con artists. They're scam artists. That's what they do. They love tricking people.
[3:53:22.000 --> 3:53:28.000]  You know, a magic show is not really magic. It's a trick. And just cosmic con artists is what we're dealing with.
[3:53:29.000 --> 3:53:31.000]  And so we're covering what the lunatic neural order believes in and how they control.
[3:53:31.000 --> 3:53:35.000]  It's final segment live. Here we go.
[3:53:38.000 --> 3:53:41.000]  I wonder if we can get Neil Young to come to the Willie Nelson concert if that happens.
[3:53:42.000 --> 3:53:43.000]  That'd be great.
[3:53:44.000 --> 3:53:45.000]  You heard about that?
[3:53:45.000 --> 3:53:47.000]  I did, yeah. I'm excited about that.
[3:53:47.000 --> 3:53:59.000]  There's a warning sign.
[3:54:10.000 --> 3:54:14.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Florida. You're on the air worldwide. Thank you for holding, sir.
[3:54:14.000 --> 3:54:16.000]  Hey, how are you doing?
[3:54:17.000 --> 3:54:18.000]  Good to finally talk to you.
[3:54:19.000 --> 3:54:25.000]  I just called in today to let you know that down here in Pensacola, Florida, we are not all being jellyfish.
[3:54:26.000 --> 3:54:27.000]  We are trying to stand up.
[3:54:28.000 --> 3:54:37.000]  And we've got a 9-11 truth symposium that we're putting on September 27th here in town and wanted to extend the invitation to Willie Nelson.
[3:54:38.000 --> 3:54:40.000]  He said he would like to have an event like that to show his face.
[3:54:41.000 --> 3:54:42.000]  And we've got a good one coming together.
[3:54:42.000 --> 3:54:43.000]  Well, that's great.
[3:54:44.000 --> 3:54:48.000]  You know, I'm helping organize the event if we do do want it, and he wants to do it in Austin, Texas.
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:52.000]  But if for some reason it turns out to be too complex, you don't want to do that.
[3:54:53.000 --> 3:54:56.000]  I am going to try to get him to at least come speak at some event.
[3:54:57.000 --> 3:55:00.000]  So leave that to me, as they say, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[3:55:01.000 --> 3:55:03.000]  Is there any website you want to plug for the event that's coming up?
[3:55:04.000 --> 3:55:07.000]  Yeah, GC911truth.com.
[3:55:08.000 --> 3:55:09.000]  Fantastic, my friend. Appreciate the call.
[3:55:09.000 --> 3:55:12.000]  Ted in Texas. Got to move quick here. Go ahead, Ted.
[3:55:13.000 --> 3:55:15.000]  Alex Freeman. Good afternoon.
[3:55:16.000 --> 3:55:22.000]  I just wanted to report on some comments from the hearings today.
[3:55:23.000 --> 3:55:32.000]  Vincent Bugliosi basically validated the last eight months of work that you've been doing in front of that whole committee,
[3:55:32.000 --> 3:55:40.000]  talking about false flag operations, specifically bringing up how Bush proposed three ways to provoke.
[3:55:41.000 --> 3:55:45.000]  He talked about the UN airplane that he proposed painting.
[3:55:46.000 --> 3:55:47.000]  I've heard a lot of people call it.
[3:55:48.000 --> 3:55:49.000]  We told Bugliosi about that.
[3:55:50.000 --> 3:55:56.000]  Well, he brought it to the committee, and after he called Bush a murder, he didn't call Bush.
[3:55:57.000 --> 3:55:58.000]  He said they could be charged with murder.
[3:55:58.000 --> 3:56:02.000]  The whole place erupted in cheer, and they were...
[3:56:03.000 --> 3:56:09.000]  We're posting all those videos on infowars.com, on prisonplanet.com, on jonesreport.com.
[3:56:10.000 --> 3:56:11.000]  They're going to be there for everybody all weekend.
[3:56:12.000 --> 3:56:16.000]  Those are the sources for all the information on the incredible hearings that we just saw.
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:19.000]  Validation for you, Alex. Thanks a bunch.
[3:56:20.000 --> 3:56:24.000]  Thank you, sir. We're going to cover all that throughout the weekend, and I'll have a bunch of clips ready.
[3:56:24.000 --> 3:56:31.000]  We're going to be playing Sunday. Be sure and join us this Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. Central Time.
[3:56:32.000 --> 3:56:36.000]  That's 5 to 7 Eastern, 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 Mountain, 4 to 4 to 6 p.m.
[3:56:37.000 --> 3:56:42.000]  Anybody can listen on the web at infowars.com, or Global Shortwave, WWCR, or on your local AMRFM dial or satellite.
[3:56:43.000 --> 3:56:44.000]  Hope to see everybody there.
[3:56:45.000 --> 3:56:51.000]  Alex, I wanted to say that I will be at Tex Marz's talk tonight at the Chinese Emperor down south on Congress.
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:56:53.000]  Is that true, stickers?
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:54.000]  At 7 p.m. tonight.
[3:56:55.000 --> 3:57:00.000]  And I will be in Portland for one of my lectures in the ESO zone, and I need to promote that a little bit.
[3:57:01.000 --> 3:57:02.000]  Good. Folks, you need to go to your website.
[3:57:03.000 --> 3:57:05.000]  Truman Show.
[3:57:06.000 --> 3:57:09.000]  I need to go to, that's what my life is trying to do, all these cameras in here.
[3:57:10.000 --> 3:57:12.000]  They're at freeman.tv.com.
[3:57:13.000 --> 3:57:15.000]  We are basically out of time. I was thinking that I had time to go to Dick and Ron.
[3:57:16.000 --> 3:57:17.000]  We just don't have time to get to you guys. I apologize.
[3:57:18.000 --> 3:57:19.000]  Freeman, thank you for coming in.
[3:57:19.000 --> 3:57:22.000]  And I don't know what's China Emperor that is.
[3:57:23.000 --> 3:57:25.000]  I think there's a couple of big Chinese restaurants in town with similar names. Where is that?
[3:57:26.000 --> 3:57:28.000]  You can find it on PowerProphecy.com. I don't have the address on me.
[3:57:29.000 --> 3:57:30.000]  But I mean, where is it in town?
[3:57:31.000 --> 3:57:32.000]  It's down on South Congress.
[3:57:34.000 --> 3:57:35.000]  Yeah, I'd have to look it up myself.
[3:57:36.000 --> 3:57:37.000]  You can find it on PowerProphecy.
[3:57:38.000 --> 3:57:39.000]  That's 7 o'clock tonight.
[3:57:40.000 --> 3:57:41.000]  Freeman, great job. Thanks for coming in.
[3:57:42.000 --> 3:57:46.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, retransmission starts in less than one minute at one place on the web.
[3:57:46.000 --> 3:57:48.000]  It's where the Info Wars starts.
[3:57:49.000 --> 3:57:51.000]  It's the jumping off point to bigger world.
[3:57:52.000 --> 3:57:54.000]  Larger horizons, unlocking your minds and souls.
[3:57:55.000 --> 3:57:57.000]  I want to thank all of you for spreading the word about the transmission.
[3:57:58.000 --> 3:58:00.000]  Get my new film Truth Rising today and spread it to everybody.
[3:58:01.000 --> 3:58:04.000]  As I said, the Info War relaunches for all the great info we covered
[3:58:04.000 --> 3:58:16.000]  in T-minus 60 seconds at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
