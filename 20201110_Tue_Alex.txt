[00:00.000 --> 00:22.080]  High Insight is 2020, and the enemy is very cunning.
[00:22.080 --> 00:26.600]  But now that they have launched their coup against President Donald J. Trump, we can
[00:26.600 --> 00:28.760]  see their battle plans.
[00:28.760 --> 00:33.920]  He got four years in the White House, and they weren't going to give him a second term.
[00:33.920 --> 00:39.840]  Plans for 2020 began immediately following the 2016 election.
[00:39.840 --> 00:45.600]  Nine days before Trump's inauguration, Fauci says there is no doubt that President Trump
[00:45.600 --> 00:49.720]  will be confronted with a surprise infectious disease.
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.400]  Two days after the president's inauguration, Bill Gates spoke at Davos and warned of a
[00:54.400 --> 00:56.880]  coming deadly pandemic.
[00:56.880 --> 01:01.960]  An illegal surveillance operation was already launched before the election, and the president
[01:01.960 --> 01:08.360]  was then subjected to four years of non-stop, baseless attacks and defamation, keeping Trump
[01:08.360 --> 01:14.320]  on the constant defense, and the American people distracted while the deep state establishment
[01:14.320 --> 01:17.000]  prepared for the 2020 election.
[01:17.000 --> 01:22.160]  The COVID hoax was in the works years before the election of Donald Trump, but they started
[01:22.160 --> 01:24.520]  fast-tracking it.
[01:24.520 --> 01:30.520]  In 2017, Dr. Fauci began the controversial program of manipulating a virus to become
[01:30.520 --> 01:32.960]  more infectious to humans.
[01:32.960 --> 01:36.320]  This is known as gain-of-function research.
[01:36.320 --> 01:43.360]  In 2018, several CIA agents are elected into public office, claiming their new mission
[01:43.360 --> 01:45.320]  is to foil Trump.
[01:45.320 --> 01:52.840]  In 2019, Fauci committed $3.7 million to the Wuhan lab in China for gain-of-function work
[01:52.840 --> 01:54.880]  on bat coronaviruses.
[01:54.880 --> 02:01.120]  In 2019, Dominion Voting Machines, funded by the Clinton Foundation, expanded their
[02:01.120 --> 02:04.680]  1,600 jurisdictions into the state of Georgia.
[02:04.680 --> 02:11.320]  In October of 2019, the Gates Foundation, the World Economic Forum, and Johns Hopkins
[02:11.320 --> 02:18.320]  sponsored Event 201, a tabletop exercise that simulated millions dying from a strain of
[02:18.320 --> 02:20.200]  coronavirus.
[02:20.200 --> 02:25.520]  Two months later, China reports an outbreak of pneumonia in Wuhan.
[02:25.520 --> 02:29.720]  March 13, 2020, the U.S. shuts down for COVID.
[02:29.720 --> 02:33.280]  Thousands of people lose their jobs overnight.
[02:33.280 --> 02:39.720]  We are told that masks don't work, and yet we are told that we must wear them.
[02:39.720 --> 02:45.800]  On March 16, the Brennan Center for Justice releases how to protect the 2020 vote from
[02:45.800 --> 02:52.680]  the coronavirus and suggest mail-in ballots among other changes to the election.
[02:52.680 --> 02:55.600]  The media tries to blame Trump.
[02:55.600 --> 03:01.160]  Fear is injected into the brainwashed masses over an alleged virus less deadly than the
[03:01.160 --> 03:03.000]  common cold.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.600]  On May 25, Soros-funded violent protests erupt throughout the country.
[03:08.600 --> 03:14.200]  For the rest of the summer, cities burn, businesses are looted, and people are murdered in the
[03:14.200 --> 03:15.880]  streets.
[03:15.880 --> 03:21.520]  The entire platform of the Democrat Party becomes, if you want the chaos to end, vote
[03:21.520 --> 03:23.500]  for Joe Biden.
[03:23.500 --> 03:29.280]  In September of 2020, the Mockingbird Media began reporting that Trump will refuse to
[03:29.280 --> 03:33.840]  leave the White House when he is beaten in November.
[03:33.840 --> 03:39.160]  On election night, just as the president begins to surge in critical states, the election
[03:39.160 --> 03:42.000]  is inexplicably halted.
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.440]  Thousands of mail-in ballots appear in the middle of the night, all for Joe Biden.
[03:48.440 --> 03:53.880]  While completely ignoring massive evidence of voter fraud, the mainstream media prematurely
[03:53.880 --> 03:56.680]  calls victory for Joe Biden.
[03:56.680 --> 04:03.080]  And now, agents of the deep state are decloaking themselves, calling for the president to concede
[04:03.080 --> 04:07.000]  and give full power back to the crooked establishment.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.600]  If the president concedes, the Trump family will be forever destroyed, and America will
[04:12.600 --> 04:15.120]  fall into chaos.
[04:15.120 --> 04:21.240]  The only route to victory is to win the election in the courts and go on a massive offensive
[04:21.240 --> 04:26.280]  against the deep state establishment and the Mockingbird Media.
[04:26.280 --> 04:31.000]  Those attempting to overthrow the United States need to be executed.
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.160]  The battle is just beginning.
[04:33.160 --> 04:35.440]  God bless America.
[04:35.440 --> 04:38.280]  For Infowars.com, this is Greg Rees.
[04:38.280 --> 04:45.240]  Now listen to me very carefully.
[04:45.240 --> 04:48.320]  There is a narrow path for Trump to defeat these globalists.
[04:48.320 --> 04:51.960]  Roderstone's going to be joining us, Paul, Joseph Watson and others, and the globalists
[04:51.960 --> 04:58.920]  that put out some incredible new announcements that are shocking, now honest they're big.
[04:58.920 --> 05:04.280]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed, and why is that?
[05:04.280 --> 05:08.920]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.440]  produces more mustard seeds.
[05:12.440 --> 05:16.560]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[05:16.560 --> 05:17.560]  They didn't know why.
[05:17.560 --> 05:22.680]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[05:22.680 --> 05:24.200]  selenium.
[05:24.200 --> 05:32.080]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at InfowarsStore.com at 50% off
[05:32.080 --> 05:35.960]  store-wide free shipping and triple-patriot points.
[05:35.960 --> 05:42.920]  Bio-true selenium at InfowarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing
[05:42.920 --> 05:44.560]  in that it funds our operation.
[05:44.560 --> 05:47.680]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[05:47.680 --> 05:51.840]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[05:51.840 --> 05:56.560]  It's back in stock 50% off triple-patriot points at InfowarsStore.com and with free
[05:56.560 --> 06:00.560]  shipping.
[06:00.560 --> 06:15.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the Resistance,
[06:15.160 --> 06:21.680]  rallying Patriots worldwide.
[06:21.680 --> 06:29.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:29.160 --> 06:35.280]  Thank you so much, my friends, for joining us on this live November 10th, Tuesday broadcast.
[06:35.280 --> 06:40.360]  I want to thank the great crew for all the wonderful work they do and all of our affiliates
[06:40.360 --> 06:46.120]  across the country.
[06:46.120 --> 06:50.080]  Every day that I come on the air is more important than the last.
[06:50.080 --> 06:53.560]  I don't need to explain that to everybody, it's as clear as the nose on your face or
[06:53.560 --> 06:55.400]  my face.
[06:55.400 --> 07:00.600]  But now the globalists, the robber barons, the most rich people on earth, and their powerful
[07:00.600 --> 07:08.800]  planetary consortium are being very, very public about their plans.
[07:08.800 --> 07:15.800]  Even the London Telegraph has huge articles out quoting the Davos group in the UN saying
[07:15.800 --> 07:22.280]  that they are implementing an artificial global depression to consolidate power and control
[07:22.280 --> 07:29.000]  to save us from carbon, but really these billionaires are just doubling their wealth now under COVID
[07:29.000 --> 07:31.640]  dictatorship.
[07:31.640 --> 07:40.320]  And top scientists are calling it a fear machine and a scientific medical dictatorship.
[07:40.320 --> 07:47.720]  But when you go to the Davos group itself, which is a public spokes group in the Bilderberg
[07:47.720 --> 07:55.000]  group, it's the same people, they admit all this word for word and J. Dyer earlier this
[07:55.000 --> 08:00.640]  year had read the head of the Davos group's new book when it came out.
[08:00.640 --> 08:02.440]  I didn't read it.
[08:02.440 --> 08:07.440]  And when he was on as a guest reading the quotes, it was just stunning to me because, again,
[08:07.440 --> 08:11.840]  I already know the enemy's agenda and I research the latest developments every day.
[08:11.840 --> 08:18.320]  But to hear it out in the open and where he says COVID is not a threat, we're just using
[08:18.320 --> 08:24.880]  it to take over and consolidate power and you're not going to have police anymore, you're not
[08:24.880 --> 08:30.280]  going to get meat anymore, and we're going to dictate to you that you'd be sterilized
[08:30.280 --> 08:31.720]  if you'd even be able to live.
[08:31.720 --> 08:36.360]  And you're going to have a card with a guaranteed income, but you're going to live at a subsistence
[08:36.360 --> 08:41.080]  level in a 250 square foot apartment.
[08:41.080 --> 08:45.720]  All family dwellings are being banned in Europe and now in the United States.
[08:45.720 --> 08:47.720]  This is a real cult, folks.
[08:47.720 --> 08:50.880]  The massacre never coming off.
[08:50.880 --> 08:55.160]  The forced inoculations are coming, but they want those to be their regime of forced inoculations
[08:55.160 --> 08:59.920]  where you accept an ID and a digital online passport.
[08:59.920 --> 09:03.320]  That's why Trump tried to accelerate the vaccine from another company.
[09:03.320 --> 09:08.880]  I'm not even defending that, but to take control of the agenda and end the lockdown.
[09:08.880 --> 09:14.600]  But as we told you last week, Biden has now announced yesterday he's posing as the president
[09:14.600 --> 09:20.320]  and is now already telling governors they better submit to him and start taking his orders.
[09:20.320 --> 09:24.040]  The media's spinning that saying, well, President Trump was president-elect and he started talking
[09:24.040 --> 09:32.480]  to folks and they had conceded the election then, the day after.
[09:32.480 --> 09:38.840]  It's not been conceded, it's in the courts and the fraud is like a dam that's broken.
[09:38.840 --> 09:46.360]  It's like a fire hose of just eyewitnesses in proof and we've got exclusive breaking
[09:46.360 --> 09:52.160]  news on that at infowars.com where a lady that we know moved here a few years ago from
[09:52.160 --> 09:54.840]  California.
[09:54.840 --> 10:00.800]  She'd lived with her mother for a while when she was there and got notice of this mail-in
[10:00.800 --> 10:09.240]  ballot and checked it out and found out that someone had voted in her name in California
[10:09.240 --> 10:12.680]  for Joe Biden, even though she voted for Donald Trump in Texas.
[10:12.680 --> 10:16.160]  She got screenshots of all of this on the Secretary of State's website.
[10:16.160 --> 10:19.800]  That's an exclusive at infowars.com right now, but there's thousands of stories like
[10:19.800 --> 10:22.800]  that.
[10:22.800 --> 10:34.080]  Good night has family that went into vote and they didn't want to see their ID, didn't
[10:34.080 --> 10:39.080]  want to see voter registration, didn't want to even know and a lot of people try to go
[10:39.080 --> 10:45.520]  vote and they find out that someone's already voted in their name and it's because we put
[10:45.520 --> 10:47.520]  up with the corruption, there's no into it.
[10:47.520 --> 10:55.000]  Thomas Jefferson was once asked what is the level of corruption and tyranny that we could
[10:55.000 --> 10:58.400]  face and he said whatever you will accept is the level of tyranny.
[10:58.400 --> 11:01.960]  There's always somebody ready to fill that vacuum when you're a sheep, when you're a
[11:01.960 --> 11:07.040]  chump, when you roll over, when you're ignorant, that'll take advantage of you and now it's
[11:07.040 --> 11:09.000]  being scientifically done.
[11:09.000 --> 11:12.880]  This is really a story of people that are invincibly ignorant.
[11:12.880 --> 11:14.960]  This is a story of people that like to be abused.
[11:14.960 --> 11:21.440]  This is a story of people so coddled in the modern age and so ready for their free lunch
[11:21.440 --> 11:29.440]  and who have such short memories that they don't even know it's being prepared for them.
[11:29.440 --> 11:31.800]  And maybe the globalists are right at some levels.
[11:31.800 --> 11:35.280]  They say there's too many people, they have no vision, they have no spirit, they have
[11:35.280 --> 11:37.840]  no destiny, they don't want to do anything.
[11:37.840 --> 11:41.600]  Look at how we're allowed to manipulate them and control them and so that's our right
[11:41.600 --> 11:46.560]  under social Darwinism to dumb them down, poison them and then finally phase them out,
[11:46.560 --> 11:51.080]  kill them.
[11:51.080 --> 11:52.080]  Might makes right.
[11:52.080 --> 11:56.360]  The establishment says we're in control, the people don't stand up for themselves,
[11:56.360 --> 11:57.360]  they deserve what they get.
[11:57.360 --> 12:00.320]  Now, I've been around some of the globalists and I know about their families and I know
[12:00.320 --> 12:07.400]  about how happy they are and the word is unhappy, that's satanic to be mean to people
[12:07.400 --> 12:10.640]  that aren't as smart as you and then dumb them down further and take advantage of them.
[12:10.640 --> 12:16.240]  I said it's better for you to kill yourself than to hurt the children and that's an allegory
[12:16.240 --> 12:20.720]  of people that aren't smart, people that are simple.
[12:20.720 --> 12:21.720]  But still there's another problem.
[12:21.720 --> 12:28.480]  The globalists are organizing the dumb down simple minded into weapon systems against
[12:28.480 --> 12:36.080]  those of us that don't want to join Satan, don't want to join the new world order and
[12:36.080 --> 12:40.040]  we don't want to destroy the third world and we don't want to destroy the dumb down and
[12:40.040 --> 12:43.960]  we don't want to destroy the impoverished and so they're going to be forged into weapons
[12:43.960 --> 12:47.320]  and RDR that will destroy us and that's the devil's trick.
[12:47.320 --> 12:57.720]  He's going to make us, make us join him and that's really where this is, is I have the
[12:57.720 --> 13:01.360]  head of the Davos group saying we're going to bring in a global depression for your own
[13:01.360 --> 13:08.400]  good and COVID's made up and they publish excerpts of it in major newspapers and say
[13:08.400 --> 13:13.560]  it's a good thing like the Financial Times, a lot of telegraph says it's a bad idea and
[13:13.560 --> 13:17.240]  I was just reminded because now this is the big hot thing Paul Joseph Watson wrote about
[13:17.240 --> 13:21.880]  today is coming on bottom of the hour but this was published six months ago.
[13:21.880 --> 13:25.640]  We had Jay Dyer on three months ago about it, reading these quotes and I'm reading them
[13:25.640 --> 13:26.640]  again though.
[13:26.640 --> 13:32.080]  It's like there's Jay Dyer reading out of the paper on Skype with us, reading out of
[13:32.080 --> 13:36.600]  the great reset book by Schwab and no one cares.
[13:36.600 --> 13:43.560]  Not when it's in the Financial Times of London, he admits he's created depression on purpose
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.000]  and the Financial Times is telling you it's a good thing.
[13:48.000 --> 13:53.960]  That's what's so crazy about this is they're openly saying that they're going to incrementally
[13:53.960 --> 14:00.480]  cut the resources off and social engineer everyone and when Bill Gates was on Japanese
[14:00.480 --> 14:04.920]  TV about eight months ago and they were saying people are scared of your vaccines, they claim
[14:04.920 --> 14:09.600]  it's a depopulation weapon and he looks at them and he says well you'll get different
[14:09.600 --> 14:15.760]  vaccines in places like Japan knowing the Japanese are smart and they're also survival
[14:15.760 --> 14:21.360]  the fittest, very brutal and smart nice people very you can leave your wallet on the table
[14:21.360 --> 14:24.880]  and nobody's going to take it for a week but if they think somebody's in charge and they
[14:24.880 --> 14:29.800]  order that person in charge to say kill all these children they'll do it and Bill Gates
[14:29.800 --> 14:34.280]  goes out to talk to them he's like it's not for you, it's for the third world and the
[14:34.280 --> 14:41.200]  bankers like I mean and I have to sit here with the average leftist screaming I'm Hitler
[14:41.200 --> 14:46.760]  when I walk down the street literally signed on to the stuff Hitler was trying to basically
[14:46.760 --> 14:53.880]  steal and do his own plan and so Bill Gates is on TV saying the lockdown never ends, it's
[14:53.880 --> 14:57.280]  going to hurt a lot of people, it's going to lower the population, he does TED Talk
[14:57.280 --> 15:01.040]  saying I'm going to make you take a vaccine so there's less people, what the hell do you
[15:01.040 --> 15:07.840]  think that means so it's very very sad and you look at the left they don't have children
[15:07.840 --> 15:12.440]  they're unhealthy they're depressed they commit suicide they're just the losers that have
[15:12.440 --> 15:18.640]  been caught up in his net and what's crazy is is they're being scooped up and taken away
[15:18.640 --> 15:24.160]  culturally, societally, spiritually they're in the nets yelling and spitting at those
[15:24.160 --> 15:30.880]  of us that tried to cut them loose you could say well we shouldn't cut them loose then
[15:30.880 --> 15:39.120]  that's how the metaphysical devil operation takes place because yeah those leftists deserve
[15:39.120 --> 15:44.480]  all the hell they're under it doesn't matter you can't then take part in it with the psychopaths
[15:44.480 --> 15:49.800]  like Gates I mean I could have joined Gates to them like that I didn't because you can
[15:49.800 --> 16:07.760]  feel the presence of God is not there they're dead that's why they want to kill us
[16:07.760 --> 16:14.040]  now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone simply go to band.video with
[16:14.040 --> 16:18.960]  your safari browser then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen when the
[16:18.960 --> 16:24.440]  menu comes up you simply click add to home screen it will then ask you to name the app
[16:24.440 --> 16:30.800]  I suggest band.video you will now have band.video app on your home screen despite the fact that
[16:30.800 --> 16:34.560]  Tim Cook tried to stop it the globalists think you're lazy but by taking a little bit of
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.640]  action you can override them have the app and then tell others about it so they can get
[16:39.640 --> 16:44.000]  the app so it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons

[16:49.280 --> 16:50.280]  band.video
[16:50.280 --> 17:02.400]  we're only here on air facing the globalist onsots the DMC funded lawsuits and everything
[17:02.400 --> 17:06.800]  that's happening because of you we built the only truly multimedia independent radio TV
[17:06.800 --> 17:11.000]  print film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalist we've had
[17:11.000 --> 17:15.560]  a devastating effect we're a national treasure you're a national treasure for supporting us
[17:15.560 --> 17:21.360]  and so go get a t-shirt go get a historic t-shirt we've got a funny one that's the Biden groping
[17:21.360 --> 17:25.200]  a woman it's it's a woman's design shirt my wife really likes it she sent me this gift
[17:25.200 --> 17:28.360]  it's pretty cute here it is and it just you know it's a little historic thing I think
[17:28.360 --> 17:32.200]  Trump's gonna win but if Biden's able to steal it we'll be probably shut down pretty quick
[17:32.200 --> 17:36.040]  so it'll be historic thing to have you'll be able to fight them in the third dimension
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.400]  on the street with graffiti with handbills you hand out and with non-compliance not paying
[17:40.400 --> 17:45.440]  taxes and pulling your kids out of the schools and just making it a full-time job to expose
[17:45.440 --> 17:49.960]  and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America we've gotten to that point
[17:49.960 --> 17:53.720]  Biden for nursing home I hope to retire Biden that'd be a collector's item get it while
[17:53.720 --> 18:02.240]  you still can we're not ordering more infowarstore.com you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:02.240 --> 18:20.600]  so general Nick Carter the head of the UK military came out over the weekend and he
[18:20.600 --> 18:27.480]  said the COVID-19 shutdown not COVID-19 is already triggering mass starvation huge conflicts
[18:27.480 --> 18:33.720]  and regional wars that threaten to start a new world war.
[18:33.720 --> 18:38.120]  The United Nations has come out in the last eight months said oh the COVID lockdown caused
[18:38.120 --> 18:42.520]  by COVID no it's caused by their lockdown he's already gonna starve hundreds of millions
[18:42.520 --> 18:47.520]  if the chain reaction continues if this goes on for a year well it's already killed millions
[18:47.520 --> 18:53.200]  and now it's getting a lot worse that's all part of the great reset it's the cover for
[18:53.200 --> 18:59.760]  that and now Klaus Schwab the head of the debos group has come out and admitted this
[18:59.760 --> 19:08.400]  is to save the earth and in the middle class and in western overconsumption and implode
[19:08.400 --> 19:14.720]  the third world this is the population weapon Psyop that's how I made the film in game 13
[19:14.720 --> 19:21.680]  years ago people ask Alex Jones how do you know all this they tell you it's we're gonna
[19:21.680 --> 19:25.920]  cover this with Paul Joseph Watson and read the quotes next segment and they've got the
[19:25.920 --> 19:30.600]  major archbishop coming out and explaining this is a health dictatorship and the cover
[19:30.600 --> 19:37.360]  for eugenics because that's what it is both articles are absolutely go together I sent
[19:37.360 --> 19:41.760]  both Joe Rogan this morning I sent both to Tucker Carlson this morning and I just said
[19:41.760 --> 19:48.320]  please for my family and yours cover this please please please sure we can argue how
[19:48.320 --> 19:52.720]  covid's exaggerated overblown all day and how it's being used for big tech to consolidate
[19:52.720 --> 19:57.520]  power now they've doubled their profits that's not that's that's the side issue that's the
[19:57.520 --> 20:04.760]  gravy for these people it's an admitted planetary bankruptcy plan to quote reset you where you
[20:04.760 --> 20:11.320]  are under their debt and where they control all private property that goes into a consortium
[20:11.320 --> 20:15.400]  and those that don't submit to the forced inoculation other social score rules will have your property
[20:15.400 --> 20:19.760]  taken and will be put in emergency centers that's what the archbishop saying not Alex
[20:19.760 --> 20:26.400]  Jones because they're saying it the UN saying it and it's already been made a test you're
[20:26.400 --> 20:30.040]  like well that'll never happen in America once the left figures out they're in a depression
[20:30.040 --> 20:35.320]  they're gonna blame Trump in his cover response not the lockdown the left will do anything
[20:35.320 --> 20:40.360]  the worse off they get the more they grovel the more they beg the more is taken away from
[20:40.360 --> 20:45.040]  them with Stockholm syndrome the more they don't think about who did it to them they listen
[20:45.040 --> 20:48.120]  to the biggest meanest abuser and say what do I do to get out of this and they're gonna
[20:48.120 --> 20:58.840]  say follow our total social edicts do whatever we say send your children for reeducation
[20:58.840 --> 21:04.600]  white people are bad turn your boys into girls this is the plan for depopulation the takeover
[21:04.600 --> 21:10.880]  all these guys live on mountaintops like literal Mount Olympus and and and Davos mountaintops
[21:10.880 --> 21:16.640]  and fly around in the jets above us and never talk to us that huge 100,000 acre 50,000 acre
[21:16.640 --> 21:21.000]  of states like Ted Turner and he has five kids but you can't have any kids and you can't
[21:21.000 --> 21:29.760]  have a small house it's sick but it's what every culture ran on before Magna Carta feudalism
[21:29.760 --> 21:35.280]  surfdom that's what we're going back into and the UN says they want neo feudalism to
[21:35.280 --> 21:40.080]  save the earth in documents from the 60s that's in my film America destroyed by design but
[21:40.080 --> 21:44.720]  now we're not telling you what's coming everything's been prepared for this because now they have
[21:44.720 --> 21:49.200]  the AI now we've all got the phones now we're all tracked now we're domesticated now we
[21:49.200 --> 21:54.520]  watch 10 hours of Netflix every day and so they're making their move but the archbishop
[21:54.520 --> 21:59.360]  and others I agree say that we don't have a choice we must fight back the more you give
[21:59.360 --> 22:07.120]  in the worse it gets resistance is a victory here is the top head of the UK military talking
[22:07.120 --> 22:12.680]  about this the full interview is at info wars dot com that the global economic crisis brought
[22:12.680 --> 22:19.760]  on by coronavirus could lead to new security threats potentially even war yes and I think
[22:19.760 --> 22:24.280]  you know we're living at a moment in time where the world is a very uncertain and anxious
[22:24.280 --> 22:31.080]  place and of course the dynamic of global competition is a feature of our lives as well
[22:31.080 --> 22:34.480]  and I think the real risk we have with quite a lot of the regional conflicts that are going
[22:34.480 --> 22:39.520]  on at the moment is you could see escalation lead to miscalculation and that's the thing
[22:39.520 --> 22:44.080]  I think we have to guard against miscalculation can you just spell that out in easy language
[22:44.080 --> 22:48.200]  what does that mean so what that means is it is that the protagonists either because
[22:48.200 --> 22:52.600]  they don't realize the implications of their actions lead to an escalation which means
[22:52.600 --> 22:57.640]  that more people perhaps get involved more weaponry gets involved and before you can
[22:57.640 --> 23:03.280]  contain it it leads to the sides ending up in a full blown war and if that happens as
[23:03.280 --> 23:07.080]  we saw in the last century I mean we have to remember history might not repeat itself
[23:07.080 --> 23:11.720]  but it has a rhythm and if you look back at the last century before both world wars I
[23:11.720 --> 23:16.040]  think it was unarguable that there was escalation that led to the miscalculation which ultimately
[23:16.040 --> 23:21.880]  led to war at a scale we would hopefully never see again so global starvation wore all of
[23:21.880 --> 23:27.920]  it oh but guess who's going to head up biden's new coronavirus task force he's equal to manual
[23:27.920 --> 23:34.640]  who went on Fox News and said he helped write Obamacare to bankrupt the US system and force
[23:34.640 --> 23:41.960]  us on to a single payer socialist system that's right there it is flashback Obamacare architect
[23:41.960 --> 23:49.320]  ACA designed to implode destroy insurance companies and now the very same guy believes
[23:49.320 --> 23:55.200]  in eugenics and euthanizing old people who wrote an article in 2014 with the Atlantic
[23:55.200 --> 24:02.040]  this is equal a manual why I hope to die at 75 when he means is we're going to kill old
[24:02.040 --> 24:07.400]  people at 75 that's the eugenics plan that's who's going to be now over the COVID thing
[24:07.400 --> 24:12.280]  because oh like Bill Gates wants to depopulate you but he has a shot to make you live longer
[24:12.280 --> 24:17.440]  and Ezekiel wants to bankrupt the country and now he's over COVID which is designed
[24:17.440 --> 24:25.040]  to keep us locked down and imploded the cults making their move but everybody likes to wear
[24:25.040 --> 24:29.400]  the mask and be heroes that's your first sign that you're in the cult your first sign of
[24:29.400 --> 24:35.240]  total subservience but coming up globalist class Schwab world will quote never return
[24:35.240 --> 24:41.040]  to normal after COVID no more police no more me no more travel you'll be lucky if you're
[24:41.040 --> 24:45.240]  alive wait till I read it and you're gonna enjoy you're gonna bow down you love it Archbishop
[24:45.240 --> 24:50.560]  writes open letter to Trump warning of COVID health dictatorship top doctors in UK hundreds
[24:50.560 --> 24:56.360]  right letter wearing a fear machine pictorial takeover on and on and on because oh but they're
[24:56.360 --> 25:01.680]  the professionals but Biden says he'll only listen to medical experts you mean the ones
[25:01.680 --> 25:12.800]  that come like Ezekiel a manual doctor Ezekiel a manual our new doctor deaths here it's all
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.880]  open look America billionaires got 434 billion dollar richer during the pandemic yes it's
[25:18.880 --> 25:28.400]  that great reset and you know they've got giant super yachts and jumbo jets but you get nothing
[25:28.400 --> 25:32.040]  and it's for the earth so it's better it's their earth now they're gonna clean you off
[25:32.040 --> 25:35.520]  they took it over through fraud and scams and now they've got election fraud and you're
[25:35.520 --> 25:40.120]  not gonna do anything so they're just gonna brush you off gonna brush you off we're gonna
[25:40.120 --> 25:43.880]  go to break no I know you're gonna do something we gotta stay on air now more than ever I'd
[25:43.880 --> 25:47.440]  hope Trump could win and we could hopefully turn the tide back quicker but you know revelation
[25:47.440 --> 25:50.640]  you know what's gonna happen we but we've got a bill and be faithful and wake up as
[25:50.640 --> 25:54.800]  many as possible and it'll get so bad that even those that are delusional and the end
[25:54.800 --> 25:58.200]  will wake up when they're being forced to be euthanized when their children are being
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.480]  taken when they're half their neighbors are dead from the vaccine and they'll just finally
[26:02.480 --> 26:07.880]  go oh what's and by then it'll be drone armies robots nerve gas helicopters flying over nerve
[26:07.880 --> 26:11.080]  gassing everybody because they've got a mop up plan so they're gonna hit us with different
[26:11.080 --> 26:17.960]  waves of bio attack over the years locking us down tighter each time and then by the
[26:17.960 --> 26:22.880]  time they get us with the real weapons will be so absolutely outnumbered outgun but it
[26:22.880 --> 26:26.640]  won't matter because humans are very strong we start to fight back and it's just gonna
[26:26.640 --> 26:30.320]  be one hell of a savage war my god it's just gonna be most of the people on earth will
[26:30.320 --> 26:34.160]  be dead at the end of this so hope you all enjoy it world governments coming to kill

[26:39.120 --> 26:43.160]  in austin are dancing in the streets and running around screaming they love satan and they

[27:28.800 --> 27:33.920]  that way he can say that trump is the blame for covid and claim that only a new lockdown
[27:33.920 --> 27:39.440]  will stop covid then of course when that new lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't
[27:39.440 --> 27:43.360]  submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and that's when all the mass arrests

[29:13.360 --> 29:18.160]  how did i do that because the globalist war game at all in public and prepare the public with
[29:18.160 --> 29:23.760]  brainwashing on msn when they put out the 80 million balance we knew it was so they could
[29:23.760 --> 29:28.880]  stuff it after the polls closed that's why they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for
[29:28.880 --> 29:34.480]  weeks of need being again it was so simple and of course you see the media heat up saying trump
[29:34.480 --> 29:39.920]  did a bad job on coven and that once biden was quote president elect he would order trump
[29:39.920 --> 29:45.120]  to admit that he did a bad job and admit that he needs a second lockdown and if he doesn't go under
[29:45.120 --> 29:49.440]  biden's immediate control and put that lock down in place he'll try to remove the president with a
[29:49.440 --> 29:53.840]  25th amendment and all of that is a trick trump to take the blame for covet that's chinese
[29:57.280 --> 29:59.840]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[29:59.840 --> 30:08.240]  so

[30:50.400 --> 30:55.680]  coming out the media is trying to cover all that up but it's not working a criminal investigation
[30:55.680 --> 31:01.520]  has been started by the attorney general doing his job there was a resignation over it acting
[31:01.520 --> 31:06.720]  like that's a bad thing to do now he underlaw he's charged to do that incredible evidence is
[31:06.720 --> 31:12.720]  just exploding like a volcano erupting we'll cover that roger stone next hour but i wanted
[31:12.720 --> 31:18.080]  to get the real heart of what's running all this who's in charge of it what's really behind the
[31:18.080 --> 31:24.000]  covet lockdown what is the great reset that greg reese first eight months ago did a video about
[31:24.880 --> 31:31.600]  in march of this year for bandod video and suddenly it's in major british newspapers
[31:31.600 --> 31:36.480]  they're telling you oh this is to lower the carbon footprint this is to permanently reset
[31:36.480 --> 31:42.240]  things and forgive your debt but you sign on to be a ward of the state and do what they tell you

[34:21.360 --> 34:27.600]  two and a half segment till roger comes on thank you thanks elix yeah we're talking about the great
[34:27.600 --> 34:34.080]  reset is it isn't it convenient that we had a president that was standing as the archbishop
[34:34.080 --> 34:40.160]  said in the article you just mentioned as a garrison between the great reset happening now
[34:40.160 --> 34:47.280]  he's conveniently apparently losing a national presidential election off the back of a coronavirus
[34:47.280 --> 34:54.240]  release back in december january which just conveniently created the pretext facilitated
[34:54.240 --> 35:00.400]  the reason for mail-in ballots that just conveniently were supposed to believe push
[35:00.400 --> 35:06.880]  joe biden over the edge of course the great reset as he mentioned elix is an agenda that
[35:06.880 --> 35:12.720]  stretches back years in fact the world economic forum on its website talked about the great reset
[35:12.720 --> 35:17.120]  back in 2016 that's when they launched it because that's when they realized that donald trump was
[35:17.120 --> 35:23.200]  going to be the big bulwark stopping it as leader of the free will now this is being pushed by
[35:23.200 --> 35:29.760]  transnational corporations the world economic forum call schwaab as you mentioned the financial
[35:29.760 --> 35:37.760]  elite and what is it it's called in their own words build back better it's a rebranding a
[35:37.760 --> 35:45.200]  rejuvenation of the new world order based around the idea that they can redistribute wealth to
[35:45.200 --> 35:52.160]  alleviate global poverty to fix wealth inequality but these very billionaires never paying taxes
[35:52.160 --> 35:55.680]  themselves and actually say they want to get rid of the middle class and over consumption so what
[35:55.680 --> 36:00.480]  they say is actually the total opposite of what they actually want to do and they want a global
[36:00.480 --> 36:04.880]  marshal plan after they collapse world economy to give them full control with the global currency
[36:05.920 --> 36:11.680]  yeah the global redistribution of wealth and power is not to the people it's to themselves it's a
[36:11.680 --> 36:18.320]  concentration of power and we see that already with the coronavirus lockdowns the chinese pandemic
[36:18.320 --> 36:25.200]  with amazon which has seen its profits in the third quarter triple triple in the third quarter
[36:25.200 --> 36:32.720]  to 6.3 billion dollars they've had a 37 percent rise in global sales why because all the shops
[36:32.720 --> 36:38.800]  are closed all the small businesses are going bust the only place to get your goods your items is
[36:38.800 --> 36:44.720]  on amazon is by going to walmart this is a global concentration of not only political but economic
[36:44.720 --> 36:51.840]  power in the name of the redistribution of global economic and political power and there's a great
[36:51.840 --> 36:58.240]  article by uh james deling poll who is a regular guest of the show called only donald trump can
[36:58.240 --> 37:03.760]  save us from the great reset and he points out that they're perfectly open about this agenda in fact
[37:03.760 --> 37:10.160]  time magazine devoted an entire special issue to this very subject and in fact you can click through
[37:10.160 --> 37:17.040]  from his article and they've got an entire section on the time magazine website called the great reset
[37:17.040 --> 37:21.760]  and again bear in mind when we start talking about this and people have already been banned had their
[37:21.760 --> 37:26.880]  content removed for talking about it it's a dangerous conspiracy theory but only if you
[37:26.880 --> 37:32.480]  say it's a bad thing if you venerate and glorify it then it's on the front cover of time magazine
[37:32.480 --> 37:37.920]  so they call it the great reset in let's be clear it's because in march in april you and i and
[37:37.920 --> 37:43.680]  greg reese and uh all of our other reporters and people david night we were all covering it we would
[37:43.680 --> 37:48.720]  get millions of views even on videos people reuploaded they would ban them saying it was this info
[37:48.720 --> 37:53.040]  because we were actually quoting their white papers they just hadn't done the public rollout yet
[37:53.040 --> 37:57.920]  they didn't want us to make their own announcement now they are exactly and then when you go on the
[37:57.920 --> 38:03.200]  time magazine website they make it clear what it's all about a better economy is possible but we need
[38:03.200 --> 38:09.360]  to reimagine capitalism to do it that means destroying capitalism especially when it comes
[38:09.360 --> 38:17.360]  to small businesses introducing universal basic income so nobody has the personal autonomy nobody
[38:17.360 --> 38:24.400]  has the incentive to build businesses to build independent wealth to challenge the global elites
[38:24.400 --> 38:30.240]  dabbos power structure it's not reimagining capitalism it's dismantling it and further
[38:30.240 --> 38:34.960]  centralizing it around themselves there's another article here i agree what would you call their
[38:34.960 --> 38:40.880]  system neo feudalism a a technocracy a form of corporate crony fascism that uses communism
[38:40.880 --> 38:47.760]  and socialism as the ground floor control mechanism the the the term is global neo feudalism that's
[38:47.760 --> 38:52.400]  the term that everybody's using in fact there's another good article called the great reset for
[38:52.400 --> 38:59.760]  dummies that sums it up the desired end result is a giant joyless highly controlled global conveyor
[38:59.760 --> 39:06.000]  of everything and everybody where privacy is tremendously expensive descent is unthinkable
[39:06.000 --> 39:11.600]  and spiritual submission is mandatory this is really good versus evil and that's the point the
[39:11.600 --> 39:18.400]  archbishop by the way this is not some obscure guy this was a guy who was instrumental in exposing
[39:18.400 --> 39:24.080]  the vatican sex abuse and financial corruption within the catholic church challenging pope
[39:24.080 --> 39:29.840]  francis calling out pope francis saying he's a water carrier for the globalist and he's outright
[39:29.840 --> 39:36.640]  saying that this great reset agenda is a battle between good and evil and again what is it it's
[39:36.640 --> 39:43.200]  the expectation that people's living standards their wealth has to be lowered and that's going
[39:43.200 --> 39:47.680]  to be achieved by this universal basic income so there's no financial ascent incentive for
[39:47.680 --> 39:54.160]  the pjw you stay there let's get more into this and how we fight back straight ahead it's time to show

[40:56.960 --> 41:03.120]  different mixes of the two one is born of renaissance the other is born of conquest one bases its power
[41:03.120 --> 41:09.920]  on having a strong enlightened focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity art and skill
[41:09.920 --> 41:16.160]  and strength the other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite
[41:16.160 --> 41:22.720]  above it america is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one
[41:22.720 --> 41:28.160]  of total mass high tech slavery that's why the globalists tell us america was founded on slavery
[41:28.160 --> 41:32.640]  when it wasn't they point out one of our evils so they can invert the facts that they are truly
[41:32.640 --> 41:37.920]  the slave masters a global permanent lockdown is here it's already causing millions and millions
[41:37.920 --> 41:42.640]  of starved death when they're done billions of starved death even the former head of the ministry
[41:42.640 --> 41:47.680]  of defense in england and a top general have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger
[41:47.680 --> 41:52.000]  a giant new world war that's the facts this is the bill gates new world order weapon

[42:27.840 --> 42:32.000]  things they can't replicate like they could but i do this because it's essential like oxygen like

[42:53.280 --> 42:59.520]  for tuning in election 2020 is here and whether trump wins or loses we have all won by exposing
[42:59.520 --> 43:05.680]  the communist chinese by exposing the globalist by exposing the pedophile rings by exposing the
[43:05.680 --> 43:10.960]  fact this is really a fight between good versus evil now i'm personally a christian i believe in
[43:10.960 --> 43:15.680]  god and i know god's real and i've experienced it in my life believe you don't believe in god it's
[43:15.680 --> 43:19.920]  important to recognize that there is good in this world there is evil and there are people out there
[43:19.920 --> 43:26.480]  that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that and what i see happening across the spectrum
[43:26.480 --> 43:31.440]  of different political views is people finally get that they finally understand that they're not
[43:31.440 --> 43:37.680]  being naive anymore don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people
[43:37.680 --> 43:42.960]  until they've proven what they stand for and who they are or you're gonna get hurt but those of
[43:42.960 --> 43:47.040]  you out there have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful will
[43:47.040 --> 43:51.520]  then come together with those organizations and support them like info wars because without
[43:51.520 --> 43:59.840]  your support info wars would not exist you're listening to the alex jones show
[43:59.840 --> 44:15.680]  the answer to 1984 is 1776
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show and we predicted everything that's unfolding
[44:26.960 --> 44:32.400]  not because i was that smart because i happened to get into reading history and then government
[44:32.400 --> 44:37.360]  documents because they were so interesting we had books laying around the house about world
[44:37.360 --> 44:44.080]  war two world war one roam ancient china japan ancient europe ancient meso america that's where
[44:44.080 --> 44:51.200]  i read books like the secret wartime report the mind of adolf hitler i read that when i was about
[44:51.200 --> 44:57.040]  10 little thin paperback book wasn't declassified to the 70s and i was hooked on it right then
[44:57.600 --> 45:03.120]  and so i was getting a phd level education on the world really worked and actually reading
[45:04.080 --> 45:09.200]  stuff by the club of roam at the time i was 15 i was going to a library people thought i was crazy
[45:09.200 --> 45:14.000]  why do you want this stuff and now we see it's who runs our world wouldn't it be good to know who
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.920]  runs your world paul joseph watson is here with us and paul again explain to people how important
[45:21.920 --> 45:26.720]  this is why the globalists want this great reset this consolidation the fact that they're going
[45:26.720 --> 45:31.840]  ahead with it and the fact that they're now even hiding it in plain view is to inoculate people's
[45:31.840 --> 45:36.880]  minds because it's their weak spot we expose this that's why they censor us they will be defeated
[45:36.880 --> 45:40.800]  but now they're the point of actually admitting their plan why are they doing that
[45:40.800 --> 45:43.920]  break down what it's like living in london or locked down to and where all this is going
[45:45.920 --> 45:49.920]  well one of the reasons they wanted alex is because they believe there's a finite amount
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.480]  of resources and they believe that if they allow too much economic freedom too much mobility
[45:55.040 --> 46:00.240]  people will build up centers of economic power and challenge them as the elite so they want to
[46:00.240 --> 46:07.600]  commodify human beings and keep them tamped down in this state of you know low expectations of
[46:07.600 --> 46:16.240]  a low economic growth and low quality of life and the origin of the term lockdown where it originated
[46:16.240 --> 46:24.320]  from was this idea of rounding up unruly prisoners and putting them back behind bars and this is in
[46:24.320 --> 46:30.480]  the spectator this week's edition says the earliest known use of lockdown because people think this is
[46:30.480 --> 46:36.160]  kind of a more archaic term it's relatively modern the earliest known use of the term lockdown
[46:36.160 --> 46:44.880]  in its current sense was a 1973 story in the Fresno B the california newspaper referring to prisoners
[46:44.880 --> 46:51.920]  being kept in their cells after a knife attack and the keywords there are after a knife attack
[46:51.920 --> 46:57.600]  again it's this idea of the prisoners have become too unruly got a little bit too much freedom there's
[46:57.600 --> 47:02.800]  a little bit too much backlash against their old world order that was failing of course they're
[47:02.800 --> 47:09.200]  meant to get it in place by 2000 now they need a new excuse and the new excuse is covid and here in
[47:09.200 --> 47:16.000]  the uk they just announced a new lockdown that took effect on thursday again the pubs are closed
[47:16.000 --> 47:21.360]  all the non-essential shops are closed oh but the the big box stores the azters which is owned by
[47:21.360 --> 47:26.400]  walmart all the tests goes you know global transnational corporations they stay open and
[47:26.400 --> 47:32.720]  they make record profits everybody else's business goes bust they introduced it on the basis of
[47:32.720 --> 47:38.400]  infections are rising so we need a new lockdown the reason infections were rising was because
[47:38.400 --> 47:44.080]  they were ramping up tests to it to the tune of a hundred to one compared to what they were during
[47:44.080 --> 47:49.360]  the initial lockdown so they come out in these government briefings and say we've got this
[47:49.360 --> 47:53.840]  prognostication this prediction which by the way has turned out to be completely exaggerated once
[47:53.840 --> 48:01.120]  again the 4 000 people a day are going to die if we don't have this lockdown then what happens and
[48:01.120 --> 48:06.880]  this happened during the first lockdown the cases and the deaths already begin to decline
[48:06.880 --> 48:11.920]  before they announce the lockdown because we're starting to get herd immunity then when the
[48:12.640 --> 48:19.440]  deaths and the cases are way below 4 000 deaths a day at the end of this one month lockdown they
[48:19.440 --> 48:25.680]  come out and say oh look we were right lockdown worked well we need to do it over and over again
[48:25.680 --> 48:29.840]  that's what all the famous epidemiologists and scientists almost to a man and woman
[48:29.840 --> 48:34.960]  are saying what you're saying and so when they show on CNN or Sky TV look here we are a year ago
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.080]  and now it's this super high level yeah but where the deaths the deaths aren't there proving again
[48:40.080 --> 48:45.280]  that this is an overblown absolute hoax of a virus that's so deadly you have to get tested even
[48:45.280 --> 48:50.720]  though you have it yeah and they over they always over exaggerate the deaths and the infections
[48:50.720 --> 48:57.440]  with fake models by the way all these models are created by the same scientists from the IPCC
[48:57.440 --> 49:03.440]  who said that the north pole would be ice-free like 10 years ago it's the exact same people
[49:03.440 --> 49:09.920]  who have proven liars time and time again so we have these crippling lockdowns and in fact
[49:09.920 --> 49:14.000]  now top scientists are coming out and saying what we said months ago there's a headline out of the
[49:14.000 --> 49:20.080]  telegraph COVID data exaggerating risk medics and academics tell Boris Johnson official data
[49:20.080 --> 49:25.920]  is exaggerating the risk posed by COVID-19 they released that after the election of course Alex
[49:25.920 --> 49:33.040]  now we have a vaccine right and the top biotech at one of these management firms is now admitted
[49:33.040 --> 49:38.480]  and this is the big story which i'm going to write up as soon as i get off the test for this vaccine
[49:39.040 --> 49:44.080]  which by the way won't be introduced until next winter because they want nearly a year's worth
[49:44.080 --> 49:50.400]  more of lockdowns just to really impose that great reset the top biotech experts now saying they had
[49:50.400 --> 49:56.720]  enough test cases weeks and weeks ago they could have announced this new vaccine beforehand
[49:56.720 --> 50:02.480]  Trump would have taken the credit they deliberately delayed announcing the vaccine until after the
[50:02.480 --> 50:08.240]  election that's not me saying that that's top biotech now Cuomo and all of us saying don't
[50:08.240 --> 50:12.400]  take it it's dangerous because this is a classic vaccine i'm not saying take it but Trump did it
[50:12.400 --> 50:16.640]  so if you want it you're in fear to end the lockdown it's the excuse to end the great reset
[50:16.640 --> 50:21.120]  that's why Trump checkmated him but they're saying no don't take it now you've got to take Bill Gates's
[50:21.120 --> 50:26.880]  mRNA vaccine a hundred times more dangerous next year so they're completely transparent now
[50:28.080 --> 50:33.040]  yeah and it's also an effort to give Joe Biden legitimacy even though he hasn't officially
[50:33.040 --> 50:38.240]  won the presidency just as it was you know when they faked the news article saying oh
[50:38.240 --> 50:43.600]  London's celebrating Joe Biden's presidency with fireworks yeah it's called bonfire night
[50:43.600 --> 50:49.360]  we have it every year it spreads out across an entire weekend it's Guy Fawkes night it's not
[50:49.360 --> 50:56.560]  people celebrating Joe Biden so they overtly faked news articles claiming that again to give Biden
[50:56.560 --> 51:01.520]  fake legitimacy just like they're doing with this COVID vaccine giving him credit for it
[51:01.520 --> 51:08.240]  now he's calling for the nationwide mask mandate which is what CNN military officials top health
[51:08.240 --> 51:13.120]  experts again linked to the global elite have said the new normal is this you're never getting
[51:13.120 --> 51:19.920]  back to the old normal it's lockdowns it's masks it's we say jump you say how high and that's
[51:19.920 --> 51:25.920]  integrally what the great reset is all about and by the way people are in such fear that I ran into
[51:25.920 --> 51:30.800]  a lady a few weeks ago that I know nice lady and she's wearing a mask for months and I said are you
[51:30.800 --> 51:35.200]  always gonna wear that because Bill Gates said he wants you to wear it for 10 years and she started
[51:35.200 --> 51:42.960]  crying and she said don't be mean to me and I said I'm just talking to you nicely but people
[51:42.960 --> 51:47.600]  are so emotional about this because when they wear the mask they hate the mask but they but
[51:47.600 --> 51:52.000]  they think it's a fear and so it's all just psychological warfare and all these psychiatrists
[51:52.000 --> 51:56.320]  all these psychologists all these major medical firms are saying it's all a lie they get censored
[51:56.320 --> 52:00.320]  it's not mainline science saying this this is a damn cult man they have really
[52:00.320 --> 52:05.280]  Stockholm syndrome Paul how do we get out of this how do we reverse this how do we stop this
[52:05.280 --> 52:11.600]  globalist takeover well the only thing to do is mass civil disobedience which is what's happening
[52:11.600 --> 52:15.920]  in Manchester in London and it's happening in Germany many major cities it's growing it's
[52:15.920 --> 52:20.640]  growing and it's growing because this they're not going to stop here the world economic forum has
[52:20.640 --> 52:26.000]  already announced they want this court what they call common pass and they show screenshots from
[52:26.000 --> 52:32.320]  the app where it says you know 7th of November COVID PCR test then that's going to be the vaccine
[52:32.320 --> 52:37.680]  added in you're not only going to not be able to travel on airlines if you don't have this vaccine
[52:37.680 --> 52:43.040]  Uber already has a thing we had an article about this months ago where if you refuse to
[52:43.040 --> 52:48.240]  wear a mask and then the driver reports you you're not allowed to get another uber until you take
[52:48.240 --> 52:53.280]  a selfie and submit they're already creating they're already arresting people not wearing them on
[52:53.280 --> 52:58.000]  planes they're already creating the no-fly list the no-drive list this is big tech isn't this
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.240]  going to censor your online folks they're going to enforce the medical tyranny over you that's
[53:02.240 --> 53:08.240]  what top scientists are saying yeah and it's the the other factor is i don't know how long we've
[53:08.240 --> 53:16.160]  gotten this segment alex but it's about property ownership um Carl Schwab the um wef uh globalist
[53:16.160 --> 53:21.920]  which we wrote about early today wrote a book called COVID-19 the great reset they're not
[53:21.920 --> 53:27.200]  hiding this they're proud of it and this is based off the world economic forums planned from 2016
[53:27.200 --> 53:33.680]  which said quote welcome to the year 2030 i don't own a car i don't own a house i don't have any
[53:33.680 --> 53:40.160]  i don't own any appliances or any clothes it's global feudalist communism on the basis of solving
[53:40.160 --> 53:45.920]  wealth inequality when in actual fact it's complete and total slavery they get all the money they get
[53:45.920 --> 53:52.320]  all the power amazon grows and grows and grows walmart grows your small business goes bust misery
[53:52.320 --> 53:57.280]  shared equally which of course is the definition of communism and then they have groups that they
[53:57.280 --> 54:01.760]  pay to riot who say white people are racist then they bring in the third world white people are
[54:01.760 --> 54:06.400]  racist so white people are supposed to sign on to now being feudal slaves and we're all slaves
[54:06.400 --> 54:11.200]  together but meanwhile jeff bezos and all of them are exempt what a nightmare and trump was starting
[54:11.200 --> 54:15.840]  to figure this out starting to fight it and is the world pulse stay there one more segment what is
[54:15.840 --> 54:20.080]  it like though you've been working with me 18 19 years to your own thing over at summit dot news
[54:20.080 --> 54:25.600]  an amazing job but you still correspond with us and still collaborate what is it like to know how
[54:25.600 --> 54:30.720]  right we were and how insane it is and to know what the next steps are that we're the only real
[54:30.720 --> 54:35.600]  institution uh fighting it and where there's just a handful of us it's an incredible time to be alive
[54:35.600 --> 54:40.240]  where everything we warned of is now manifesting exactly as we said our number two straight ahead
[54:40.240 --> 54:48.320]  stay with us talk about tomorrow's news today this is all very transparent when you war game it out
[54:48.320 --> 54:54.240]  six months ago in four wars predicted the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from
[54:54.240 --> 54:59.440]  trump they would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had
[54:59.440 --> 55:04.080]  in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory and now that happened now
[55:04.080 --> 55:08.960]  what else did i predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night all on record
[55:08.960 --> 55:15.200]  that when joe biden was president-elect via fraud trump would challenge it but biden's next move would
[55:15.200 --> 55:21.200]  be to form his own covet task force say that trump is inept and has killed 267 thousand americans
[55:21.200 --> 55:27.040]  which is a true and demand trump's removal via the 25th amendment if he doesn't let joe biden's
[55:27.040 --> 55:31.600]  new covet task force give all the new orders they'll tell trump that if he backs down and follows
[55:31.600 --> 55:35.440]  their orders and steps down they won't blame him for covet but if he doesn't they're gonna blame him
[55:35.440 --> 55:39.440]  for covet but then if he does do what they say he's still gonna blame him anyways plus this has
[55:39.440 --> 55:46.560]  been for marshal law destroy the economy i warned you all i get asked all the time by listeners and
[55:46.560 --> 55:51.600]  by the media what am i most proud of when it comes to the show and it's the fact that info war is
[55:51.600 --> 55:56.720]  more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the club of rome and the cfr and others were
[55:56.720 --> 56:02.160]  actually saying developed the hypothesis that the communist china had been set up to take our
[56:02.160 --> 56:07.440]  jobs and transform to china and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt
[56:07.440 --> 56:11.600]  well now china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one side of trading deals
[56:12.160 --> 56:17.840]  it turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on but again it wasn't that hard the cfr and others
[56:17.840 --> 56:23.440]  admitted what they were doing but still others didn't want to focus on that issue we did and
[56:23.440 --> 56:28.880]  you focused on it by supporting us at info wars so when you go to info war store dot com and get
[56:28.880 --> 56:33.920]  all the great supplements books t-shirts films water filtration air filtration all of it you're
[56:33.920 --> 56:38.000]  funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening
[56:38.000 --> 56:41.040]  so that's a big accomplishment for all of you i'm gonna thank you for your support
[56:41.040 --> 56:59.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:59.360 --> 57:10.320]  oh baby i'm gonna teach you what a love's all about tonight trust me baby trust me honey
[57:10.320 --> 57:21.440]  everything's gonna be all right just do like i do there ain't nothing to listen to me baby
[57:21.440 --> 57:29.680]  oh you gotta do is just let yourself go all right final segment paul watson
[57:31.200 --> 57:35.760]  he's gonna take over in the fourth hour and he will be uninterrupted to go into this incredible
[57:35.760 --> 57:41.200]  stuff this archbishop put out that is dead on veritas the great reset how to fight back against
[57:41.200 --> 57:47.280]  of the election and more roger stone's coming up next segment with paul not tuning our horn but man
[57:47.280 --> 57:53.360]  this is surreal uh that that there were almost no institutions covering this you get massive
[57:53.360 --> 57:57.440]  resistance we did it you've been with info wars working not doing your own thing at summit dot
[57:57.440 --> 58:03.120]  news but collaborating with us for 19 years isn't it 19 years now paul and to just see everything
[58:03.120 --> 58:11.280]  unfolding is it surreal for you it's very it's very otherworldly for me i mean it's surreal it's
[58:11.280 --> 58:17.360]  kind of affirming in a sense but then it's also bizarre in the sense that that's why they did the
[58:17.360 --> 58:22.880]  de-platforming that's why you literally have wikipedia controlled by this uh tranche of left
[58:22.880 --> 58:28.880]  wing zealots who they do the fact checking and so you go on wikipedia look on the great reset i
[58:28.880 --> 58:34.000]  imagine it's just a wild conspiracy theory even as they're admitting it it's that notion of the fact
[58:34.000 --> 58:38.720]  they're laying it all out they're calling it the fourth industrial revolution but if we talk about
[58:38.720 --> 58:44.080]  it and criticize it then it doesn't exist one more point though alex on there this carl schwaab
[58:44.080 --> 58:49.520]  world economic forum who by the way is invested in all the vaccine manufacturing just by coincidence
[58:50.080 --> 58:55.520]  in his book the great reset which doesn't uh exist simultaneously because we're talking about it
[58:55.520 --> 59:01.520]  he says many of us are pondering when things will return to normal the short response is
[59:01.520 --> 59:06.080]  never never if you listen to this guy talk he sounds like dr strangel i put it in one of my
[59:06.080 --> 59:13.680]  videos all of us will have to hide it in the pit with the belly bones but then a key paragraph
[59:13.680 --> 59:20.320]  or sentence in his book he says quote unlike certain past epidemics covet 19 doesn't pose a new
[59:20.320 --> 59:26.000]  existential threat so therein he's knowingly acknowledging that they exaggerated the threat
[59:26.000 --> 59:31.360]  to seize the power now what does that remind you of bearing in mind these same people behind the
[59:31.360 --> 59:39.280]  great reset were behind the global warming hysteria agenda 1993 the club of rome its co-founder alexander
[59:39.280 --> 59:46.720]  king wrote the first global revolution stating quote the common enemy of humanity is man in
[59:46.720 --> 59:51.200]  searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global
[59:51.200 --> 59:56.400]  warming famine and the like would fit the bill so they're continuing that same theme the common
[59:56.400 --> 1:00:03.120]  enemy of man is man where all super spreaders were all infected and the technocratic global
[1:00:03.120 --> 1:00:09.520]  elite needs to save us from our own downfall and it's all the same people that were behind it back
[1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:14.880]  in the late 80s early 90s behind it now and their sons and daughters it's the same elite
[1:00:15.840 --> 1:00:19.760]  and what you're saying is not speculation you've read the book they put this out four years ago
[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:24.240]  they said our global warming scam isn't working we need something new and they said something
[1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:29.440]  like a virus that'll create a global government that'll teach us that humans are obsolete that'll
[1:00:29.440 --> 1:00:34.000]  cut the carbon footprint and then that allows the ai takeover because we can't leave our house the
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.560]  robots have to bring things to us but really we're all just being made obsolete in the post human
[1:00:38.560 --> 1:00:44.000]  world which even newsweek and associated press and roiders and nbc news and the wall street journal
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:50.400]  write articles about dreaming about the post human future that's what this is right and the ai takeover
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:56.960]  is facilitated by the public humiliation by the cancel culture which feeds into the social
[1:00:56.960 --> 1:01:01.920]  credit score so it's not just if you're a good citizen and you're behaving if you're friends
[1:01:01.920 --> 1:01:07.760]  with someone who's violated a lockdown law then you get punished so it's about merging the public
[1:01:07.760 --> 1:01:12.960]  humiliation cancel culture into the social credit so if somebody doesn't wear a mask inside your
[1:01:12.960 --> 1:01:17.360]  house you're all in trouble so it's about getting us all to be robots to enforce on each other
[1:01:17.360 --> 1:01:23.360]  exactly the prisoners guarding the other prisoners headline hit actually develops fish bubble to
[1:01:23.360 --> 1:01:28.400]  enforce social distancing you set off an alert if you get too near to another person you lose
[1:01:28.400 --> 1:01:32.480]  two points on your social credit score now you can't buy a train ticket now you can't fly now
[1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:36.480]  you can't go and see your family now you're not talking to other humans you're all in the phone
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:41.600]  in the ai bubble only living through it in fear everything a dystopic video game you're back in
[1:01:41.600 --> 1:01:48.320]  two hours paul to take over for a full hour paul joseph watson summit dot news an amazing site
[1:01:48.320 --> 1:01:56.080]  great report it's thank you paul the miraculous properties of tumeric have been admired even
[1:01:56.080 --> 1:02:01.280]  worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations with modern science we know
[1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:08.560]  why tumeric is so popular it's antioxidant effect it's anti-inflammatory effect everything it does
[1:02:08.560 --> 1:02:15.200]  is simply amazing and most tumerics out there are simply food products they're three to five percent
[1:02:15.840 --> 1:02:24.000]  curcuminoid but we have bodies ultimate tumeric formula with a 95 percent curcuminoid level
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:29.040]  and we have other organic products in there that accelerated and bringing into the cells of the body
[1:02:29.040 --> 1:02:33.840]  it's been sold out for months it's back in stock and despite that bodies ultimate tumeric formula

[1:03:05.200 --> 1:03:15.840]  the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex joneshow wow things are really
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:23.200]  heating up and i want to say to tucker carlson you got me you got me talker i love you man last
[1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:31.040]  night his 25 minute monologue was just perfect total truth he goes to his own fox colleagues he goes
[1:03:31.040 --> 1:03:38.800]  no proof of election fraud here let's show you this boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom boom
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:44.240]  and it was only a fraction of it that's my problem we've got so much but listen separate from that
[1:03:44.240 --> 1:03:48.800]  roger stones getting dialed on the skype right now he is a realist one of the smartest political
[1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:52.480]  operatives out there and he says trump still has a path to victory in stopping his fraud
[1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:56.880]  they'll be talking about it with us in a moment but here's mitch mcconnell the leader of the senate
[1:03:56.880 --> 1:04:01.680]  knocking it out of the park when he talks about the democrats saying how dare you contest an election
[1:04:01.680 --> 1:04:09.920]  here it is now more broadly mr president let's not have any lectures no lectures about how the
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:15.840]  president should immediately cheerfully accept preliminary election results from the same
[1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:20.320]  characters who just spent four years refusing to accept the validity of the last election
[1:04:22.160 --> 1:04:30.480]  and who insinuated that this one would be illegitimate two if they lost again
[1:04:32.240 --> 1:04:38.720]  only if they lost so let's have no lectures on this subject from that contention in late
[1:04:38.720 --> 1:04:44.480]  august secretary hillary clinton said quote joe biden should not concede under any circumstances
[1:04:45.600 --> 1:04:51.280]  i think this is going to drag out and he will win it if we don't give an inch
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:58.880]  that same month speaker polosi and the democratic leader both stated quote president trump needs
[1:04:58.880 --> 1:05:08.000]  to cheat to win in october when speaker polosi was shopping some conspiracy theory about the
[1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:14.960]  postal service she recklessly said quote listen to this i have no doubt that the president will lie
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:24.000]  cheat and steal to win the election now does this sound like a chorus that has any credibility
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:30.400]  whatsoever to say a few legal challenges from president trump represents some kind of crisis
[1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:38.560]  at this time last week small business owners in cities across america were boarding up their
[1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:45.440]  windows in case president trump appeared to win and far left mobs decided to reprise their summer
[1:05:45.440 --> 1:05:54.160]  rioting suffice it to say a few legal inquiries from the president do not exactly spell the end
[1:05:54.160 --> 1:06:00.640]  of the republic here's two professors from fordham law school and new york law school
[1:06:01.520 --> 1:06:07.440]  this is how they put it quote for centuries we've asked people who are unhappy with their
[1:06:07.440 --> 1:06:12.400]  fellow citizens or government agencies and institutions bring their claims to court
[1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:21.200]  president trump is quote a traditional response that affirms rather than undermines american
[1:06:21.200 --> 1:06:31.440]  institutions end quote this process will reach its resolution our system will resolve any recounts
[1:06:32.160 --> 1:06:39.920]  or litigation in january the winner of this election will place his hand on a bible just like
[1:06:39.920 --> 1:06:48.800]  it happened every four years since 1793 what we know for sure is that the outcome is guaranteed
[1:06:48.800 --> 1:06:55.600]  to delight tens of millions of americans and disappoint tens of millions of americans but
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:03.520]  we also know that we will wake up on january 21st still blessed to live in the greatest nation
[1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:09.760]  the world has ever seen and in no small part that is because we respect the rule of law
[1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:21.360]  well we trust our institution and neither of those things we are back live with roger stone on
[1:07:21.360 --> 1:07:27.760]  trump's path to victory what the real numbers are and what's unfolding roger stone is a smart
[1:07:27.760 --> 1:07:32.400]  political operator he says trump still has a chance we still have a chance to stop this deal
[1:07:32.400 --> 1:07:36.320]  he joins us from florida roger thank you so much for taking time out go ahead sir
[1:07:36.320 --> 1:07:43.440]  uh alex it is really extraordinary what's going on here but a hoax is being perpetrated on the
[1:07:43.440 --> 1:07:51.120]  american people that joe biden is the legitimate president of the united states through a elaborate
[1:07:51.120 --> 1:07:58.800]  psi op you got to give these people credit for ingenuity and repetition what but they know that
[1:07:58.800 --> 1:08:06.320]  that donald trump in fact won a majority of all legal votes cast they know that there is evidence
[1:08:06.320 --> 1:08:15.760]  everywhere of substantial malfeasance and ballot and election fraud which is like which they have
[1:08:15.760 --> 1:08:23.840]  absolutely limited in this wall of mass media control in which big tech big media big money
[1:08:23.840 --> 1:08:33.200]  big left is attempting to bury their theft of this of this election at the same time trying to
[1:08:33.200 --> 1:08:42.560]  put the stamp of legitimacy on this this act a egregious act of not only injustice but a fraud
[1:08:43.360 --> 1:08:49.920]  and the deeper you dig you know that not only do they like holocaust deniers despicable people
[1:08:49.920 --> 1:08:55.920]  they kept insisting no no there is no evidence of fraud they tried out romney and bush like
[1:08:55.920 --> 1:09:01.520]  anybody's going to be impressed with that they falsely claim republicans are crumbling to run
[1:09:01.520 --> 1:09:07.680]  away from trump that's another line but that it's very hard for the president to maneuver
[1:09:07.680 --> 1:09:14.400]  he is now forced to go the legal course those who say there is no evidence clearly aren't looking
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:20.560]  online or looking at any of the credible information that's actually public that this is all their
[1:09:20.560 --> 1:09:27.280]  theft is provable and a number of different methods in all of these swing states you can go to stop
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:33.760]  the steel and we'll we'll be posting that but there is insurmountable compelling overcoming
[1:09:33.760 --> 1:09:40.000]  evidence of fraud but one is essentially censored at the one at the point that they
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:46.080]  say that publicly and we saw this gaslighting we saw this mind control we saw this this this
[1:09:46.080 --> 1:09:53.680]  hoax with all the networks trying to be the king makers here with cabuto um on fox kicking off the
[1:09:53.680 --> 1:10:00.080]  live feed of the press spokesperson which was laying out facts and then if you expand on that
[1:10:00.080 --> 1:10:04.000]  pecker carlson last night said okay let's look at what she actually said and let's look at the facts
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:09.920]  and it's true i have stacks of red-handed fraud pull controllers going we're going to steal this here's
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:14.080]  how you falsify them here's how you keep the people out and the machines flipping everywhere
[1:10:14.080 --> 1:10:18.160]  against trump and every time they flip them back trumps winning and the fact that trumps gaining
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:22.880]  votes in all these states right now because because the poll managers know they can go to
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:28.000]  prison they're suddenly finding the problem and reporting it so trump gaining in all these states
[1:10:28.000 --> 1:10:35.200]  before the recounts even began roger it's insane no there it's uh it's to create a backdrop uh
[1:10:35.200 --> 1:10:40.720]  to demoralize those who support the president that's why at this point in this epic struggle
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:47.520]  there's nothing more important than peaceful protest and demonstration in the public square
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:54.320]  because we're banned in the public square of uh you know of the the massive social media
[1:10:54.320 --> 1:11:00.080]  because we're censored but we have to show our numbers that's why the rally in washington dc this
[1:11:00.080 --> 1:11:05.600]  weekend is crucial where numerous conservative organizations have come together some that
[1:11:05.600 --> 1:11:10.480]  have bickered in the past but would one common goal which is to show that the american people
[1:11:10.480 --> 1:11:16.960]  will not put up with this heist it's a hoax i'm gonna be at that park at noon on saturday i'm

[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:29.280]  now that's great to have folks travel from texas but we need hundreds more and thousands once we

[1:12:03.920 --> 1:12:11.600]  communist infiltrated democratic party and their other corporate handlers and they had already
[1:12:11.600 --> 1:12:17.920]  moved to ronald reagan richard nixon donald trump in in droves also you have a great southern

[1:15:52.080 --> 1:15:56.160]  it's only about eight minutes left in this segment you've got the floor roger trump's path to victory
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:16:02.640]  are trump to victory how do we trump this fraud how do we override the scam well first of all the
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:09.200]  backdrop we have to have mass public protests uh just as oan schreuer is driving a caravan folks
[1:16:09.200 --> 1:16:15.360]  join oan schreuer in that caravan oan schreuer i think is one of the hardest fighting young
[1:16:15.360 --> 1:16:21.600]  patriots i've ever met and the conservatives across the south need to jump in their pickup
[1:16:21.600 --> 1:16:28.640]  trucks or their station wagons or their suvs or their land rovers or their uh or uh any other
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:35.360]  four-wheel vehicle uh and follow and fill your car with fellow patriots who will go to washington
[1:16:35.360 --> 1:16:42.800]  to express their support in peaceful protest of the outrageousness of this mass media hopes
[1:16:43.840 --> 1:16:51.840]  they are trotting out all of these uh you know uh deep state figures bush romney others try to
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:57.600]  rubber stamp which what they know is a fraud uh and no for those who say there is no evidence this
[1:16:57.600 --> 1:17:05.840]  is an absurdity there is overwhelming and and uh far enough evidence to file very uh aggressive and
[1:17:05.840 --> 1:17:12.720]  and factual uh and significant enough cases uh in the courts in the appropriate states and the
[1:17:12.720 --> 1:17:18.400]  president has made it very clear that he's going to do that that is step one obviously should he
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:24.880]  lose any of those arguments because he only needs to knock out one state under their phony count uh
[1:17:24.880 --> 1:17:33.040]  that is allowed to move forward uh would be a would be a victory for him so they they discount
[1:17:33.040 --> 1:17:39.520]  this that as if that is an absurd idea when in fact legally their case is overwhelming and compelling
[1:17:39.520 --> 1:17:46.400]  but if he fails in all of them he can appeal all of them or any of them to the us supreme court
[1:17:47.040 --> 1:17:54.080]  where a decision is made secondarily let's say hypothetically the court incorrectly or
[1:17:54.080 --> 1:17:59.600]  because they were in some way corrupted ruled against him i don't think patriots understand
[1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:06.880]  that the last chain in this process is the legislature certifying who the electors who
[1:18:06.880 --> 1:18:15.600]  will go to the electoral college uh are under the us constitutional system but they are in
[1:18:15.600 --> 1:18:22.880]  fact uh not uh you know this they are who we're shooting for if you understand yes sir not
[1:18:22.880 --> 1:18:27.520]  interrupting because i want you to get it all out so it's important to show this public support
[1:18:27.520 --> 1:18:33.360]  before i get too deep here the state legislatures who are controlled by republicans will make this
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:39.360]  final decision and therefore if the evidence is is just as broad and as deep as we know it is
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:45.920]  it can be shown to them as a decision making body those state legislators agree with us that
[1:18:45.920 --> 1:18:53.040]  donald trump won this election they're republicans they need to send electors pledge to the true winner
[1:18:53.040 --> 1:19:00.320]  in their state if it is obvious that through some glitch or some manipulation of the voting systems
[1:19:00.320 --> 1:19:08.800]  as we see in uh pennsylvania as we see in wisconsin as we see in michigan as we see uh in the and then
[1:19:08.800 --> 1:19:15.200]  in arizona plus this psi op where they declare arizona which is still not out of donald trump's
[1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:22.160]  reach early but they have not yet declared north carolina oh they're waiting for i don't know 2021
[1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:28.080]  to tell us that trump won north carolina but see he has to be denied that kind of victory stroke
[1:19:28.080 --> 1:19:33.200]  because of the hoax their purpose because it shows that wow he could come back that's why they froze it
[1:19:33.760 --> 1:19:37.840]  when biden was about 20 points ahead of him with the delegates and that's why they're so scared
[1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:42.960]  that arizona's coming back and now that's so slow oh we can only count a few thousand a day
[1:19:42.960 --> 1:19:48.240]  even though there's they have a statistic out today if it continues to flip the way it is if
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:52.080]  they count the votes he'll win he'll win arizona i mean they're indeed trouble
[1:19:54.480 --> 1:19:59.040]  i think that's absolutely right and they're rolling out everything they have i saw a commentary
[1:19:59.040 --> 1:20:06.880]  by ben ginsberg very very able lawyer but a bush guy one of their hatchet men very tough guy excellent
[1:20:06.880 --> 1:20:13.680]  lawyer who unfortunately said the president should essentially just say there's nothing here in terms
[1:20:13.680 --> 1:20:20.480]  of uh and step aside and i like ben but he's he's incorrect as a lawyer he should understand that
[1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:29.200]  there's deep and pervasive credible presentable uh uh evidence of ballot fraud in numerous ways
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:35.280]  that can be fought through the courts and if you lose in the courts you still have at the supreme
[1:20:35.280 --> 1:20:40.800]  court let's say you still have the ability to drive the patriots to make our republicans say
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:44.320]  legislators understand that they make the final decision that's right there's really passed to
[1:20:44.320 --> 1:20:48.720]  this but let's just back up for a minute jake tapper and all the democrats in 2000 wrote books
[1:20:48.720 --> 1:20:52.400]  saying the election was a fraud they tried to overturn the election four years ago
[1:20:53.360 --> 1:20:59.040]  trumps not conceded hillary conceded then tried to sneak back and tried to hold back the delegates
[1:20:59.040 --> 1:21:05.040]  i mean we have real legitimate issues with all the project veritas and all of it and also saw
[1:21:05.040 --> 1:21:09.440]  commenter on info wars today roger explain this to them they're like why do you have an article
[1:21:09.440 --> 1:21:14.560]  about california how a woman that lives in texas that votes republican they used to live in california
[1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:18.320]  went and checked the secretary of state's office there and found out she's voted the last two
[1:21:18.320 --> 1:21:22.880]  elections for hillary and now for biden why would they need to cheat because they have the state
[1:21:22.880 --> 1:21:27.360]  they have the state because they cheat it's a chicken or the egg issue they don't get it
[1:21:27.360 --> 1:21:32.000]  that if we let this happen texas will go blue everything will go blue we've got to have such
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:35.520]  landslides over wide they're fraud but now they know what to do because the landslide
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:39.680]  they just close the polls when we're winning bringing all the amounts of fraud they need
[1:21:39.680 --> 1:21:44.640]  and the graphs all show it no there's no question else we have a system here where they've actually
[1:21:44.640 --> 1:21:49.360]  rigged the system so the bat the election does not end on election day on election day they see
[1:21:49.360 --> 1:21:55.120]  how much we have won by and then they simply go out and fabricate manufactured that almost magical
[1:21:55.120 --> 1:22:01.840]  number of votes usually just a few votes higher than what we had to declare a false victory
[1:22:01.840 --> 1:22:07.440]  it's it you know they always accuse you of doing that which they are doing they're trying to pull
[1:22:07.440 --> 1:22:12.320]  off a fraud here they have a legitimate case but i'm saying here is there are two major battlegrounds
[1:22:12.320 --> 1:22:16.720]  so we have to fight this through the courts and those who have the president's ear who are telling
[1:22:16.720 --> 1:22:21.280]  him that he should concede are not serving the president well well this is like a football
[1:22:21.280 --> 1:22:26.080]  game when the higher up reps override the refs on the field they do instant replay and you find
[1:22:26.080 --> 1:22:30.480]  out the ref was wrong i mean we were allowed to have instant replay we've already done instant
[1:22:30.480 --> 1:22:36.800]  replay and it's showing massive fraud well and it's look at at the same time let's be clear that
[1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:42.720]  trump wins a record number of rate of votes for a republican candidate for president he he goes
[1:22:42.720 --> 1:22:50.240]  deep into the african-american hispanic americans to win stunning numbers highest of any republican
[1:22:50.240 --> 1:22:56.720]  presidential candidate in history he had one of the great greatest closes in american history
[1:22:56.720 --> 1:23:03.760]  but let's be clear his campaign unfortunately having a billion dollar financial advantage
[1:23:03.760 --> 1:23:13.040]  misspent their resources so when the wall of mass media big media tech censorship went up and paid
[1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:20.160]  advertising was the only way to penetrate that wall they had no cash meanwhile biden was pummeling
[1:23:20.160 --> 1:23:25.840]  them you know six to one on network television three to one on cable so let's talk about what
[1:23:25.840 --> 1:23:28.880]  has to be done now you were damn right probably you told me all this but you don't want to be
[1:23:28.880 --> 1:23:31.680]  negative we're gonna come back with a few more months at roger stone then i'm gonna get back
[1:23:31.680 --> 1:23:36.240]  on the great reset and the latest election fraud and all the insanity here but uh this is a lot
[1:23:36.240 --> 1:23:41.520]  bigger than just trump folks this is going to be biden with an endless lockdown under the un
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:45.920]  debos group to bankrupt the u.s just like the island from world bank bankrupt terrible countries
[1:23:45.920 --> 1:23:50.320]  they're about to do it to us right back with roger stone communist china's been fully open for
[1:23:50.320 --> 1:23:55.440]  business for more than six months but the european union at every other major western nation
[1:23:55.440 --> 1:24:00.160]  is still under some form of lockdown and the lockdowns are getting more intense and people
[1:24:00.160 --> 1:24:04.080]  are being told they're going to be arrested if they leave their houses just like we've seen
[1:24:04.080 --> 1:24:10.240]  in australia you see the authoritarians want total control and because they don't respect this
[1:24:10.240 --> 1:24:15.920]  because the general public puts up with so much abuse they're going for broke why shouldn't they
[1:24:15.920 --> 1:24:20.000]  they never get in trouble for the big illegal wars they never get in trouble for the chinese slave
[1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:24.320]  camps they never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in africa they never get
[1:24:24.320 --> 1:24:30.160]  in trouble for shipping fentanyl other deadly drugs into our country and so why shouldn't they go
[1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:35.280]  for broke because so many people are domesticated and they're soft and they have scott com syndrome
[1:24:35.280 --> 1:24:40.320]  they love their abusers they can't believe they're being lied to they can't believe they're being
[1:24:40.320 --> 1:24:45.440]  conned and so they're going into bondage you see there's always a minority that says no
[1:24:45.440 --> 1:24:52.000]  and info wars is that minority dna force plus if you did one thing for your immune system
[1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:57.680]  it would be get all the essential things and that's the clean i9 x2 or x3 that's the bio tricillinium
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:02.400]  that is the vitamin d3 that is the c that is the zinc there's 13 vitamins and minerals that are
[1:25:02.400 --> 1:25:05.680]  essential about them you die and studies show you really need the other ones too but dna force
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:10.560]  goes beyond that it helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with pqq and coq10 of the
[1:25:10.560 --> 1:25:16.240]  highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells that unclog them so all
[1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:21.280]  that stuff can get in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in because the NIH website says
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:25.040]  if you have all the proper things they can't replicate like they could but i do this because
[1:25:25.040 --> 1:25:30.000]  it's essential like oxygen like water dna force sold out for months 50 off out of the gates
[1:25:30.000 --> 1:25:35.040]  triple pay three at points free shipping infowarstore.com dna force election special that's
[1:25:35.040 --> 1:25:38.720]  going to have to end in a week we've got a limited supply it was very hard to get the pqq this time
[1:25:38.720 --> 1:25:42.080]  a lot of our stuff is it can't get any more a lot of our products because the supply chain's broken
[1:25:42.080 --> 1:25:46.960]  down that's part of the global's plan infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three
[1:25:46.960 --> 1:25:51.040]  nine i want to thank you all for tuning in for those drinking the globalist koolaid what i call
[1:25:51.040 --> 1:25:57.200]  the invincibly ignorant there is no hope but for those of you that care and are informed we have
[1:25:57.200 --> 1:26:02.880]  more than hope we have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the truth i have
[1:26:02.880 --> 1:26:08.800]  been warning everyone of exactly what was going to come in the exact order how did i do that because
[1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:14.720]  the globalist wargame at all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing on msn when they put
[1:26:14.720 --> 1:26:20.160]  out the 80 million ballots we knew it was so they could stuff it after the polls closed that's why
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:26.080]  they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks of need being again it was so simple
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:30.880]  and of course you see the media heat up saying trump did a bad job on covid and that once
[1:26:30.880 --> 1:26:36.640]  biden was called president-elect he would order trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit
[1:26:36.640 --> 1:26:41.200]  that he needs a second lockdown and if he doesn't go under biden's immediate control and put that
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:45.680]  lockdown in place he'll try to remove the president with a 25th amendment and all of that is a trick
[1:26:45.680 --> 1:26:54.400]  to trump to take the blame for covid that's chinese you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:14.160]  the revolution against the globalist steel is on at bandodvideo info wars dot com and on over 200
[1:27:14.160 --> 1:27:18.160]  radio stations and tv stations across the united states picking up the alex jones show
[1:27:19.760 --> 1:27:26.240]  we are a live wire all right roger stone former chief political advisor to the president
[1:27:27.200 --> 1:27:30.640]  is live with us and you're the perfect god asked this question only get back into what
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:35.040]  you think trump needs to do the path to victory right now very pragmatic very real world very
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:40.480]  real politic but you're the guy they chose to be the russian mastermind though they admitted no
[1:27:40.480 --> 1:27:46.400]  connection to russia no communications of russia all lies we all know where it came from inside
[1:27:46.400 --> 1:27:51.520]  the dmc wiki leaks the rest of it but to have them hold up this election for three years not
[1:27:51.520 --> 1:27:57.280]  let trump be president say the elections illegitimate try to put you in prison all the shenanigans
[1:27:57.280 --> 1:28:02.640]  general flin all of it and then now you've got hunter biden confirmed laptop even abc news
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:09.040]  confirmed it three weeks after it came out with hookers with underage girls uh talking about his
[1:28:09.040 --> 1:28:14.000]  dad on the email with his dad talking about money hundreds of millions of dollars to sell out
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:21.360]  to china and and and ukraine and three million plus from the from the wife of the moscow mayor and
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:27.680]  all of this and then how do we have president joe biden when he's compromised if joe biden was
[1:28:27.680 --> 1:28:33.280]  an old-fashioned just democrat and and actually won or even stole it i wouldn't be going crazy
[1:28:33.280 --> 1:28:38.720]  but he's a chi-com agent that says china should dictate every aspect of our lives polosi says well
[1:28:38.720 --> 1:28:43.360]  of course china wants joe biden china's celebrating their currencies way up saying we've defeated
[1:28:43.360 --> 1:28:48.880]  america our man runs america talk about face saving for the chinese to say that they're like
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:53.520]  rubbing our face in dog but they're telling us to eat it and the average liberal thinks it's funny
[1:28:53.520 --> 1:28:59.280]  they think it's cute but the guy that tried to get jobs back and stop all the corruption and fix
[1:28:59.280 --> 1:29:05.280]  the va and stand up to these trade i mean trump was helping everybody biden's gonna shut off the
[1:29:05.280 --> 1:29:10.480]  the the the the oil and gas he's gonna freaking bankrupt us so all these rich globalists can buy
[1:29:10.480 --> 1:29:17.280]  us up that's the great reset roger this is horrible this is i mean i again if biden won by 50
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:22.800]  percent i'd be against him he's illegitimate he is what they claim he word he is a goddamn foreign
[1:29:22.800 --> 1:29:30.160]  spy and i hope he burns in fucking hell well it's not just that there's or all all kinds of
[1:29:30.160 --> 1:29:36.800]  hard evidence of the abuse of the electoral process in a violation of the laws uh you know
[1:29:36.800 --> 1:29:42.160]  in all kinds of varieties of fraud and mail in ballots people voting twice dead people voting
[1:29:42.160 --> 1:29:46.800]  people voting after they're legally allowed to vote we know that the supreme court has already
[1:29:46.800 --> 1:29:54.560]  ruled uh at least four justices have already ruled in a prior case that that such conduct is
[1:29:54.560 --> 1:30:02.480]  illegal uh if if uh the new justice a me uh the saint uh joins them uh then donald trump wins at
[1:30:02.480 --> 1:30:08.800]  the u.s supreme court on that issue alone and then this goes to a whole second dimension it's not
[1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:14.800]  just the old time machine type ballot fraud people voting twice unregistered people voting
[1:30:15.760 --> 1:30:20.960]  forge ballots fabricated ballots you have a whole second level here where sydney powell
[1:30:20.960 --> 1:30:29.440]  and tom fit and have correctly talked about the hammer uh a very uh invasions uh federal uh
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:38.880]  essentially surveillance uh uh abuse uh which had uh corrupted uh and been able to manipulate
[1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:45.600]  votes through a uh through a scorecard program that was specifically designed to work through
[1:30:45.600 --> 1:30:51.200]  the back doors of the state election boards at the computer explain how this works explain how this
[1:30:51.200 --> 1:30:55.520]  works and also get to the first part they get the names they skip the names of dead cats dead
[1:30:55.520 --> 1:31:00.160]  dogs dead people they send out ballots to all these addresses and then they just know democrats
[1:31:00.160 --> 1:31:03.760]  are going to fill them out fraudulently and then that's what completes the fraud is they've got a
[1:31:03.760 --> 1:31:09.360]  giant ocean of people ready to engage in scams and we saw triple the google searches for you
[1:31:09.360 --> 1:31:14.400]  know what is the what's the prison time for for being involved in voter frauds we'll also speak to
[1:31:14.400 --> 1:31:20.720]  that well but that's the i think that's kind of the old time way of doing things let's understand
[1:31:20.720 --> 1:31:25.200]  the depth to which the deep state has gone here yeah let's go this new thing explain to us what
[1:31:25.200 --> 1:31:29.280]  tom fenton and what you just watched was talking about there are two important things to know here
[1:31:29.280 --> 1:31:35.760]  that are going on first and foremost uh it is absolutely clear that the government developed
[1:31:35.760 --> 1:31:48.400]  a software that gave you the ability to to uh to manipulate the voter system online and online
[1:31:48.400 --> 1:31:54.800]  intrusion through the merge point of their surveillance technology uh in the state election
[1:31:54.800 --> 1:32:02.240]  boards and they could move votes within that technology uh and they had an numerous foreign
[1:32:02.240 --> 1:32:07.680]  elections they have this enormous evidence that they have used that technology to heist
[1:32:07.680 --> 1:32:16.560]  this election and then secondarily the dominion voting machines that that architecture uh is uh
[1:32:16.560 --> 1:32:25.600]  is problematic in terms of having been infected with manipulative tools it is a microsoft bill
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:32.320]  gates production uh he and a bunch of other leftists uh that is the second round of fraud
[1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:39.600]  look at the history of dominion in previous elections it's it's it's uh another uh intrusive
[1:32:39.600 --> 1:32:47.200]  program that is being used to manipulate and and show a fraudulent victory by joe biden but
[1:32:47.200 --> 1:32:52.480]  that's how deep it is not just the old-fashioned machine oh i found the the ballots were in the
[1:32:52.480 --> 1:32:58.080]  dumpster for down from it's not that old-fashioned type of corrupt this goes to a whole new level
[1:32:58.080 --> 1:33:05.200]  of chicanery and the and the mainstream media internet-based media corporate-owned media media
[1:33:05.200 --> 1:33:12.160]  blackout of that story of that evidence is the backdrop to under which we are currently fighting
[1:33:12.160 --> 1:33:17.200]  and i totally agree with you so what do we call this segment uh roger stone exposes next level
[1:33:17.200 --> 1:33:22.880]  election fraud by deep space that makes you know i think our head i think our headline is join the
[1:33:22.880 --> 1:33:32.160]  patriots in washington dc uh this weekend to protest the hopes that is the theft of this election
[1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:38.400]  and demand that we stop the steel hashtag stop the media is going to try to ignore it but we're
[1:33:38.400 --> 1:33:41.600]  going to be there they're the enemy let me raise this for you next segment we're going to hit it
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:45.760]  with you so you can stay longer guess what who climbed out from under a rock just went live on
[1:33:45.760 --> 1:33:51.920]  in four words dot com on the video next segment x c i h e brennan pushes palace coup against trump
[1:33:51.920 --> 1:33:56.480]  to stop declassifications they're calling for 20 with amendment and of course as i predicted
[1:33:56.480 --> 1:34:01.920]  they're saying oh he's not following the president elects who's not even president elects directives
[1:34:01.920 --> 1:34:06.400]  on covid for a new lockdown we've got to remove him or there's more deaths and we can't allow
[1:34:06.400 --> 1:34:10.960]  declassifications trump's not allowed to 25th amendment him now they are really desperate
[1:34:10.960 --> 1:34:17.440]  i think they realize they could fail in this fifth coup roger uh well they certainly have
[1:34:17.440 --> 1:34:24.240]  the our leader in their sights uh and but this false psychology uh is almost seamless in which
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:31.440]  they keep insisting uh in their epic censorship of media uh their their their blitz of lies i mean
[1:34:32.080 --> 1:34:39.120]  today there is a story that the irs forgave a tax lien against me for 1.5 million dollars a gift
[1:34:39.120 --> 1:34:46.480]  from down from administration when in fact they uh they relinquished the lien in miami dade county
[1:34:46.480 --> 1:34:51.360]  a county i haven't lived in for 10 years and refiled it immediately in broward county where i
[1:34:51.360 --> 1:34:58.000]  do live giving me no tax advantage whatsoever it was it was a bureaucratic paperwork by the way
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:02.160]  you can owe them a thousand dollars they'll put the full value of the house in the lien it's just
[1:35:02.160 --> 1:35:08.640]  total theater it doesn't matter the media reports act one but not act two stone trump
[1:35:08.640 --> 1:35:15.680]  gives tone gift removes lien from poem it's uh it's all you know it's all garbage but with this
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:20.400]  wall of censorship i can't tell people other than places let me say how cold-blooded they are
[1:35:20.400 --> 1:35:25.600]  exactly that's how these places are so precious like these little oases in the desert i said i'm
[1:35:25.600 --> 1:35:29.520]  not gonna put an anti slap thing on the sandy hook families even though they sued me i'm not
[1:35:29.520 --> 1:35:34.960]  gonna ask for attorney's fees if i win no one's ever done that when so they ran with a headline
[1:35:34.960 --> 1:35:41.360]  jones sues families of sandy hook total inversion of reality absolutely total inversion of reality
[1:35:41.920 --> 1:35:47.200]  it's just crazy what goes on roger trump's path to victory i mean i think i think it can happen
[1:35:49.120 --> 1:35:53.280]  well he has to have the resolve to fight it through but more importantly the it's time for
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:36:01.520]  the inforiors to join the fight we have to do large boisterous legal uh respectful but meaningful
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:08.080]  public protest uh you know every time there's a major event uh the the the outrageousness here
[1:36:08.080 --> 1:36:14.720]  there's going to be a protest at the fox headquarters in washington dc on us uh which i believe is on
[1:36:14.720 --> 1:36:21.440]  wednesday uh led by that great patriot ed martin and others come out to that stop the steal event
[1:36:21.440 --> 1:36:27.920]  be there saturday in washington db dc meet oh and shroyer meet me uh and join the brigade of
[1:36:27.920 --> 1:36:33.600]  courageous patriots who are we're not going to stand for this and are going to take to the streets
[1:36:33.600 --> 1:36:39.360]  for peaceful protest they're gagging you on the internet they're gagging you on social media
[1:36:39.360 --> 1:36:44.560]  but they can't stop you from showing up at the capital that's right i have one more question
[1:36:44.560 --> 1:36:50.720]  roger what does trump need to do visually and verbally talk about tomorrow's news today this
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:56.160]  is all very transparent when you wore game it out six months ago info was predicted the mail
[1:36:56.160 --> 1:37:01.200]  in ballots would be used to steal the election from prompt they would simply pause the voting at
[1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:05.920]  night and then have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground
[1:37:05.920 --> 1:37:10.640]  states to secure the victory and now that happened now what else did i predict a few months ago and
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:17.200]  again last week and again last night all on record that when joe biden was president elect via fraud
[1:37:17.200 --> 1:37:22.480]  trump would challenge it but biden's next move would be to form his own covet task force say
[1:37:22.480 --> 1:37:28.240]  that trump is inept and has killed 267 thousand americans which isn't true and demand trump's removal
[1:37:28.240 --> 1:37:34.240]  via the 25th amendment if he doesn't let joe biden's new covet task force give all the new orders
[1:37:34.240 --> 1:37:37.920]  they'll tell trump that if he backs down and follows their orders and steps down they won't
[1:37:37.920 --> 1:37:41.360]  blame him for coven but if he does that they're gonna blame him for coven but then if he does do
[1:37:41.360 --> 1:37:45.280]  what they say he's still gonna blame him anyways plus this has meant for marshal law destroy the
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:54.800]  economy i warned you all it's all on record yale harvard princeton stanford they were all hired a
[1:37:54.800 --> 1:38:00.720]  year ago and then against six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down
[1:38:00.720 --> 1:38:05.920]  during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations and they talk about calling
[1:38:05.920 --> 1:38:11.360]  people heroes that do it they talk about shaming those that don't this has all been psychologically
[1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:17.120]  tested it's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days you
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:22.400]  notice now they say it's permanent that's how it works oh just put these handcuffs on the serial
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:28.000]  killer says the woman in the parking lot everything will be all right no now we've already put the
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:34.720]  handcuffs on and we're in the serial killers fan he's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly
[1:38:34.720 --> 1:38:40.000]  torture us to death that's the allegory we gotta bust out of this thing now we gotta say no now
[1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:44.880]  we gotta make a run for it now we still can't once he gets us in that basement it's gonna get a lot
[1:38:44.880 --> 1:38:52.640]  a lot worse folks so stop submitting there are many references in the holy bible to the mustard

[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:54.720]  roger it really is amazing to see the way fox announced here at zona early against the president
[1:41:54.720 --> 1:42:00.320]  and the way they're the place we see the knives being drawn out right now it really is a quite
[1:42:00.320 --> 1:42:06.160]  extraordinary the way this is uh this is folding out this is an epic struggle for the soul of the
[1:42:06.160 --> 1:42:11.040]  country they're trying to pull off one of the greatest hopes is since the war in commission
[1:42:12.400 --> 1:42:18.400]  their egregious tactics and the the enormous evidence which all of which is can be posted
[1:42:18.400 --> 1:42:24.560]  on pline they're now in denial about uh and then these media stunts like pulled off by uh neil
[1:42:24.560 --> 1:42:33.680]  cavuto and uh fox uh trotting out the bushes and romney as if that means something uh this kind
[1:42:33.680 --> 1:42:41.520]  of wall of resistance uh to the truth that they claim is a political narrative uh this is this is
[1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:48.240]  disgraceful uh when a an associate attorney general resigns because the attorney general
[1:42:48.240 --> 1:42:54.320]  gives a general order that federal attorneys are supposed to pay attention to solid evidence of
[1:42:54.320 --> 1:43:01.040]  ballot fraud this man resigned saying there is not he he resigns because there is none
[1:43:01.040 --> 1:43:06.960]  he should be penalized by the bar that's false not not bill bar but the the association of
[1:43:06.960 --> 1:43:11.760]  attorneys because there is real and compelling evidence that has not yet been hurting absolutely
[1:43:11.760 --> 1:43:17.120]  federal law says bar's supposed to do that fraud that's their hopes and they're on the
[1:43:17.120 --> 1:43:22.880]  custom of uh pulling it off because of the censorship uh which is why we have to go all
[1:43:22.880 --> 1:43:29.600]  pirate radio uh if we want to you know get the truth about this out it's extraordinary
[1:43:29.600 --> 1:43:36.320]  isn't it incredible how trump's biggest failure he got peace he turned the economy back on
[1:43:36.320 --> 1:43:40.960]  he defended the second all these things but he didn't defend the first amendment with action
[1:43:40.960 --> 1:43:45.280]  and that was that was i mean they really thought as you said that they could cut out
[1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:50.160]  his amplification and cut out his supporters uh and that they wouldn't censor him when it
[1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:56.080]  came time for his destruction it was a big failure well i i know that he doubted that
[1:43:56.080 --> 1:44:01.520]  twitter would ever have the audacity to censor the president of the united states but in fact
[1:44:01.520 --> 1:44:07.200]  they have done so nine or ten times just in recent days when everything the president said was
[1:44:07.200 --> 1:44:12.400]  supportable and allowable under the first amendment but there's only one narrative it is there and if
[1:44:12.400 --> 1:44:16.560]  you don't agree to it well ultimately they'll burn your neighborhood down uh because their
[1:44:16.560 --> 1:44:21.600]  shock troops are waiting out in the suburbs with their knives she's but waiting for the moment to
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:27.440]  stop the start the looting and the throwing of bricks and the beating of senior citizens and
[1:44:28.560 --> 1:44:33.280]  after they burn their own neighborhoods they've already said they intend to move to the suburbs
[1:44:33.280 --> 1:44:39.520]  and there's evidence that they have uh so this isn't we've never seen this dynamic in american
[1:44:39.520 --> 1:44:46.400]  politics before yet they pull off this media con job let the president have his day in court
[1:44:46.400 --> 1:44:50.400]  i believe will appeal prevail in one of the state courts which means the game's over and he wins
[1:44:50.400 --> 1:44:55.600]  unless they want to appeal to the supreme court which would be foolish or if that does not play
[1:44:55.600 --> 1:45:01.360]  out the president could appeal the verdict of any of the litigations he has filed to the u.s supreme
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:08.000]  court with a sufficient broadness to understand what the court's already ruled on which would be his
[1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:15.760]  best case for the appeal but he couldn't prevail in court in if and if not he has the recourse and
[1:45:15.760 --> 1:45:21.200]  his supporters will have to support this to take it to the last legal court of opinion that's the
[1:45:22.160 --> 1:45:28.720]  state legislatures the state legislatures in the swing states are overwhelmingly held in both houses
[1:45:28.720 --> 1:45:34.240]  by republicans those republicans have to stand tall for the truth and that's already starting
[1:45:34.240 --> 1:45:37.840]  that's already starting in michigan and other areas again everywhere they're starting to go back
[1:45:37.840 --> 1:45:43.040]  through the computers they're admitting machines flipped against trump in every case this is so
[1:45:43.040 --> 1:45:49.920]  obvious in georgia uh in michigan in pennsylvania in arizona and it's some of the same companies
[1:45:49.920 --> 1:45:56.080]  tied to soros and the carlall group and james becker the third who's also come out obviously
[1:45:56.080 --> 1:45:59.840]  against trump i mean this is so obvious that trump is the anti-establishment candidate
[1:45:59.840 --> 1:46:03.120]  when as you said there's this whole wall in closing roger stonestonegoldruth.com
[1:46:03.920 --> 1:46:10.240]  let me ask you this what does the president need to do why has he not been seen uh in a speech
[1:46:10.240 --> 1:46:15.520]  in three days why did he only give a few other speeches we know of that were pretty tame you
[1:46:15.520 --> 1:46:20.160]  know the one where he said i'm really the winner uh on november 4th in the middle of the night was
[1:46:20.160 --> 1:46:27.120]  pretty good in the early morning but he needs to be in up there having resolute desk every night
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:32.080]  the american people about what's happening why isn't he using his ultimate weapon well first
[1:46:32.080 --> 1:46:38.800]  of all let's give this man his due uh at 73 years old he just staged one of the greatest and most
[1:46:38.800 --> 1:46:45.600]  improbable comebacks in american political history against an array of manipulation by big tech big
[1:46:45.600 --> 1:46:54.640]  money big corporations big china uh and all of these other uh uh uh criminal actors uh and uh
[1:46:54.640 --> 1:47:00.960]  with this media blackout he still through his rallies and these massive crowds that he pulled
[1:47:00.960 --> 1:47:06.720]  and the punching through of the key messages we say reciting his positive record of job growth
[1:47:06.720 --> 1:47:15.200]  uh of criminal justice reform uh of uh of uh of the renewal of uh american manufacturing jobs
[1:47:15.760 --> 1:47:21.280]  they uh they complained about his handling of covet yet in truth everything joe biden said
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:26.720]  that he's going to do in his hot new task force has already been done and probably better than
[1:47:26.720 --> 1:47:32.480]  joe biden could have done it so uh you know this is going to be an epic struggle and right now
[1:47:32.480 --> 1:47:38.800]  turn to the streets this is the key message for everybody who contacts me says is it hopeless is
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:44.400]  there a way forward is there it's up to you it's up to you it's up to you don't let don't fall for
[1:47:44.400 --> 1:47:50.560]  their scy op which they tell you it's over it's not over till we say it is and by the way by the way
[1:47:50.560 --> 1:47:54.240]  if biden had really wanted there wasn't massive fraud and systemic scamming and they hadn't
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:58.640]  pre-programmed it with all the ballots and all of this and if they weren't censoring everybody's
[1:47:58.640 --> 1:48:02.800]  who who criticized that i'd say okay let the idiot win especially if he wasn't a chinese communist
[1:48:02.800 --> 1:48:07.680]  agent but i mean we've got to fight this it's only going to get worse and they're watching us very
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:10.960]  closely right now if we roll over to this it's only going to green light them to go that much
[1:48:10.960 --> 1:48:15.840]  more crazy roger keep joining us if you can't even it's for a segment or two every day owens on the

[1:48:26.640 --> 1:48:31.120]  uh i wanted to bring people up to date because they need to understand the president has a
[1:48:31.120 --> 1:48:35.840]  compelling case he needs to be allowed to take it to the court those who say there is no evidence
[1:48:35.840 --> 1:48:42.480]  are part of a of a mass hypnosis attempt by the mainstream media as one who has seen the evidence
[1:48:42.480 --> 1:48:48.640]  and talked to the lawyers and read the law yes he has an overwhelming case stop the steal is posting
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:55.600]  much of this material and will be posting more so any american can see in arizona in pennsylvania
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:04.000]  in michigan uh in wisconsin in minnesota there are enormous uh levels of documentable credible
[1:49:04.000 --> 1:49:08.400]  ballot theft in every that's right we're going to cover it next hour roger stone thank you so much
[1:49:09.200 --> 1:49:14.640]  all right alex great to be with you god bless america and god bless the president of the united
[1:49:14.640 --> 1:49:18.480]  states that's right you know i don't just guys show her people and trump made a lot of mistakes
[1:49:18.480 --> 1:49:21.600]  but i've been a man on the arena i know how hard it is when you're in the actual fight
[1:49:21.600 --> 1:49:26.560]  he'd way better than i could have done he turned the country around all of us got persecuted for him
[1:49:26.560 --> 1:49:31.520]  i i lost almost everything i own i got demonized roger almost went to prison lost most of what he
[1:49:31.520 --> 1:49:37.520]  had so i stood with trump because i knew he was a good guy he did so much for the average person
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:41.840]  and how he doubled the money to black colleges and how he put 50 something billion into
[1:49:43.200 --> 1:49:47.760]  to development zones in black neighborhoods and just you know and and the and the prison reform
[1:49:47.760 --> 1:49:53.200]  and and because he really cares and and to watch the system piss all over that with that joe biden
[1:49:53.200 --> 1:49:58.160]  calling us racist makes me sick but you know what you can lead a horse to water you can't make him
[1:49:58.160 --> 1:50:02.480]  drink we're going to start the next hour i'm sure he's going to pop in stewart roads oh keepers is

[1:50:07.040 --> 1:50:10.080]  nine about eight o'clock that's the real rallying point we're counting on folks we went through

[1:50:15.360 --> 1:50:21.200]  dc for this event if you don't you're crazy because this is all about visuals and it's

[1:50:28.160 --> 1:50:33.280]  we are running the emergency sale and it is an emergency sale i don't know what to call it so i
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:39.760]  just wrote this long wrong wrong title american crisis emergency lockdown two is coming sport
[1:50:39.760 --> 1:50:44.240]  info war is the fight against total economic collapse and biden's martial law disguises
[1:50:44.240 --> 1:50:50.240]  lockdown two we can change this but info wars has got to stay on air because we're one of the few
[1:50:50.240 --> 1:50:54.160]  places to tell them the truth and again i want to thank you all but you need the products we have

[1:51:54.560 --> 1:52:05.760]  accuracy rate is way way better than theirs we try to tell the truth they try to lie they try to see i'm trying to get people to realize that the globalist operate how they manipulate how they
[1:52:06.960 --> 1:52:12.400]  bamboozle the public i'm trying to get the public to ask questions and do not believe what they're told in the face
[1:52:12.960 --> 1:52:20.080]  i'm trying to get people to research for themselves the globalists and their controlled corporate press say that
[1:52:20.080 --> 1:52:26.240]  researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory well again on its face
[1:52:26.240 --> 1:52:32.240]  that is a fraud question everything question info wars add your own research to it and then decide what
[1:52:32.240 --> 1:52:37.040]  you're going to promote to others and what new sources are accurate i believe info wars is the best source out there
[1:52:38.880 --> 1:52:48.240]  warning warning warning there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover the giant third world collapse
[1:52:48.240 --> 1:52:54.160]  and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new covet lockdown announced by globalist systems
[1:52:54.160 --> 1:53:02.960]  in europe in asia and now in the united states joe bite is set to announce today that he has a new covet task force
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:08.400]  that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude contact tracing forced
[1:53:08.400 --> 1:53:15.200]  inoculations coming but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can say that trump is to
[1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:21.920]  blame for covet and claim that only a new lockdown will stop covet then of course when that new
[1:53:21.920 --> 1:53:26.720]  lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it and
[1:53:26.720 --> 1:53:31.600]  that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year this is a permanent
[1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:38.320]  martial law plan trump must be putiated expose faucian gates and the un takeover not play games with it
[1:53:38.320 --> 1:53:44.240]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:53:49.920 --> 1:53:58.960]  big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny well so does he
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:08.480]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones well john brennan who is a communist
[1:54:08.480 --> 1:54:13.200]  registered communist voted communist twice says he's a communist he also joined al qaeda he's a
[1:54:13.200 --> 1:54:20.400]  wahhabist you can't make this up total globalist agent he says trumps the enemy and he says we're
[1:54:20.400 --> 1:54:25.600]  all bad xca chief at the spot of the president legally pushes palace coup against president
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:31.200]  trump to stop the classifications i mean these are monsters they're so close to go into prison
[1:54:32.320 --> 1:54:36.000]  the fact that they're chinese communist agents i mean they sell out everything their whole job is
[1:54:36.000 --> 1:54:41.280]  get rid of america destroy america no borders no walls no usa at all another claiming trumps the
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:46.800]  enemy and he's got some book out so here he is with the disgusting rats quomo uh that killed all
[1:54:46.800 --> 1:54:50.880]  those his brother killed all those old people in new york here he is with that mafia don's little
[1:54:50.880 --> 1:54:57.040]  brother freido talking about uh our president being bad here it is it's clear that mark espar
[1:54:57.040 --> 1:55:02.320]  was removed as secretary of defense because he rebuffed donald trump's efforts to politicize
[1:55:02.320 --> 1:55:07.840]  the u.s military and i think it's quite apparent from the reporting that mark espar has stood up
[1:55:07.840 --> 1:55:13.200]  to don trump repeatedly who knows what else he has refused to do and the secretary of defense
[1:55:13.200 --> 1:55:17.920]  position is i think the most consequential position in the u.s government aside from the
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:23.040]  president of the united states because it is the secretary of defense who carries out the orders
[1:55:23.040 --> 1:55:29.120]  given by a president for military operations and if mark espar has been pushed aside because he is
[1:55:29.120 --> 1:55:35.280]  not you know listening to donald trump you know carrying out these these orders who knows what
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:40.560]  his successor this acting secretary christ miller is going to do if donald trump does give some type
[1:55:40.560 --> 1:55:45.840]  of order that really is counter to i think what our national security interests need to be one more
[1:55:45.840 --> 1:55:51.120]  rebuttal to his shoulder shrug 70 days you know he'll be gone in 70 days anyway once the electoral
[1:55:51.120 --> 1:55:58.240]  college meets we have the inauguration 70 days you can do a lot of damage in 70 days he still is
[1:55:58.240 --> 1:56:02.880]  the president of the united states and is he going to carry out these vendettas against other
[1:56:02.880 --> 1:56:07.840]  individuals as you pointed out chris ray or jenna hasport or others it is clear that donald trump
[1:56:07.840 --> 1:56:14.000]  is trying to exercise the power because he can and he is going to settle scores but i'm very concerned
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:18.960]  what he might do in his remaining 70 days in office is he going to take some type of military
[1:56:18.960 --> 1:56:23.040]  action is he going to release some type of information that could in fact threaten our
[1:56:23.040 --> 1:56:28.320]  national security interests so i think people need to be looking very carefully at what he's doing
[1:56:28.320 --> 1:56:33.280]  and unfortunately republicans in congress continue to give donald trump a pass all right so this is
[1:56:33.280 --> 1:56:40.000]  the key question what can be done short of him messing with the electoral college and trying to
[1:56:40.000 --> 1:56:44.880]  have republican or friendlies pick their own electors and you know go grand scale with faithless
[1:56:44.880 --> 1:56:50.320]  electors what can be done to stop anything he wants to do in the next 70 days well if last
[1:56:50.320 --> 1:56:55.840]  president penson the cabinet had an ounce of fortitude and spine and patriotism i think they
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:01.520]  would seriously consider invoking the 25th amendment um and you know pushing donald trump out because
[1:57:01.520 --> 1:57:08.080]  he is just very unpredictable now he's like a cornered cat tiger and he is going to lash out
[1:57:08.080 --> 1:57:13.520]  and the fact that again that he has the powers of the presidency in his hands is quite worrisome
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:18.640]  now we we know that the attorney general bar has done donald trump's bidding in the past will he
[1:57:18.640 --> 1:57:25.280]  continue to do that vis-a-vis this election i don't know what i do this is the best news yet
[1:57:25.280 --> 1:57:30.720]  back it up 20 segment 20 seconds i want to play that when we come back a cornered tiger now they
[1:57:30.720 --> 1:57:36.320]  admit he's this powerful creature that represents the american soul and they are so scared because
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:42.640]  they are rats notice when colmo put out a tweet about it they said oh trump is like we asked him
[1:57:42.640 --> 1:57:48.160]  in the article that comes with that thanks they they said he's like a cornered rat no no you're
[1:57:48.160 --> 1:57:54.880]  the cornered rats with the cat and so this is a big big deal all right i got a bunch of news i'm
[1:57:54.880 --> 1:57:59.520]  going to hit on this front and where we really are as a society in a country ahead of oh and shroy
[1:57:59.520 --> 1:58:07.440]  are popping in and then we're also going to have oathkeepers founder and a great patriot constitutional
[1:58:07.440 --> 1:58:13.680]  lawyer stuart roads joining us as well please remember the only way bandot video gets out

[2:00:42.240 --> 2:00:48.640]  their coup against president donald j trump we can see their battle plans he got four years in
[2:00:48.640 --> 2:00:55.200]  the white house and they weren't going to give him a second term plans for 2020 began immediately
[2:00:55.200 --> 2:01:03.360]  following the 2016 election nine days before trumps inauguration fouchy says there is no doubt
[2:01:03.360 --> 2:01:09.120]  that president trump will be confronted with a surprise infectious disease two days after

[2:01:15.520 --> 2:01:20.800]  an illegal surveillance operation was already launched before the election and the president
[2:01:20.800 --> 2:01:27.200]  was then subjected to four years of nonstop baseless attacks and defamation keeping trump
[2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:33.120]  on the constant defense and the american people distracted while the deep state establishment
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:39.280]  prepared for the 2020 election the covet hoax was in the works years before the election of
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:47.360]  donald trump but they started fast tracking it in 2017 dr fouchy began the controversial program
[2:01:47.360 --> 2:01:53.680]  of manipulating a virus to become more infectious to humans this is known as gain of function
[2:01:53.680 --> 2:02:02.240]  research in 2018 several cia agents are elected into public office claiming their new mission
[2:02:02.240 --> 2:02:10.320]  is to foil trump in 2019 fouchy committed 3.7 million dollars to the wuhan lab in china
[2:02:10.320 --> 2:02:17.680]  for gain of function work on bat coronaviruses in 2019 dominion voting machines funded by the

[2:02:49.120 --> 2:02:56.880]  people lose their jobs overnight we are told that masks don't work and yet we are told that we must
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:04.640]  wear them on march 16th the brennan center for justice releases how to protect the 2020 vote from
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:12.560]  the coronavirus and suggest mail-in ballots among other changes to the election the media tries to
[2:03:12.560 --> 2:03:19.920]  blame trump fear is injected into the brainwashed masses over an alleged virus less deadly than
[2:03:19.920 --> 2:03:27.600]  the common cold on may 25th soros funded violent protests erupt throughout the country for the
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:33.520]  rest of the summer cities burn businesses are looted and people are murdered in the streets
[2:03:34.560 --> 2:03:41.280]  the entire platform of the democrat party becomes if you want the chaos to end vote for joe biden
[2:03:41.280 --> 2:03:47.520]  in september of 2020 all right this video is titled the four-year plan to overthrow an elected
[2:03:47.520 --> 2:03:52.400]  president it's an amazing video i think it only has like 300 000 views it needs 30 million views
[2:03:52.400 --> 2:03:57.920]  we want to save the country but i had to go to that break because they were giving me such intel
[2:03:57.920 --> 2:04:04.480]  because i was about to go to owens shroyer so let's move steward roads at 33 after
[2:04:04.480 --> 2:04:11.840]  because i want to talk to oen about this right now then we'll talk about the caravan because
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:20.160]  this actually got my heart pitter pattering pitter pattering i just played brennan scared
[2:04:20.160 --> 2:04:25.520]  going i'm worried what he can do in the next 70 days we need to remove trump right now
[2:04:26.400 --> 2:04:31.680]  he's putting in a secretary of defense that's an enemy of america and then mike panpeo the
[2:04:31.680 --> 2:04:37.200]  secretary of state we're talking 20 minutes ago and our crew caught this because only a sub feed
[2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:43.040]  at the state department said quote there will be a smooth transition to the second trump
[2:04:43.040 --> 2:04:49.120]  administration now here's the deal if joe biden won fair and square i would still oppose him because
[2:04:49.120 --> 2:04:53.120]  he's a chinese communist agent but it's worse than that they're stealing it publicly which
[2:04:53.120 --> 2:04:57.520]  means they'll keep doing it believe me i don't want to be launching caravans to the east coast
[2:04:57.520 --> 2:05:01.840]  i don't want to be going into mordor myself about to go on airplane tomorrow but i'm going to be
[2:05:01.840 --> 2:05:07.920]  there because it's my children and my very american dna demands it and if they steal this and they
[2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:12.640]  start trying to come get people under this covid lockdown then my genetics demand something else
[2:05:12.640 --> 2:05:17.280]  and i want to stop this now but to have the attorney general launch a criminal investigation
[2:05:17.280 --> 2:05:21.840]  confirming it's all going on to have it all pouring out to have pompeo saying this and to see brennan
[2:05:21.840 --> 2:05:29.600]  for the first time he's an arrogant sob he looked scared on kwamo today almost like hey it's ours
[2:05:30.560 --> 2:05:35.600]  and brennan's like we're in danger we've got to remove trump now very scared aren't you he said
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:43.760]  he's like a corner tiger and i'm telling you man this is a psyop but they they filled in all
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:47.840]  the other psyops and we just got to get the word out now everybody's got to hit the streets i had
[2:05:47.840 --> 2:05:53.200]  this idea this morning welcome to five a.m for everyone to put like a red square on their business
[2:05:53.200 --> 2:05:58.320]  or on their car and you'll get attacked so what we're on your just just saying you know i'm a
[2:05:58.320 --> 2:06:02.400]  republican i'm an american not republicans appropriate it's a symbol i read blood you
[2:06:02.400 --> 2:06:10.160]  i'm pro-human and do that and and because we'll show we got all the votes which we know but i mean
[2:06:10.160 --> 2:06:13.360]  it's time that's why they want to intimidate us and scare us to be quiet because they know the
[2:06:13.360 --> 2:06:18.560]  word the majority and they know 50 some percent of black men voted for trump 30 some percent of
[2:06:18.560 --> 2:06:23.520]  black women the word is it's way higher than the 30 some percent they said they're losing control
[2:06:23.520 --> 2:06:29.120]  of the people they had control of and us and everybody it's beautiful i mean i gotta tell you
[2:06:29.120 --> 2:06:33.600]  every black person i know supports trump every white person i know supports him i got a bunch of
[2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:38.480]  family we're democrats they support trump uh wow i'm gonna play this clip next segment but this is
[2:06:38.480 --> 2:06:44.240]  just bomb shell oh and shroyer where are you right now rolling along pretty epic footage in that armored
[2:06:44.240 --> 2:06:48.480]  vehicle uh i guess you're in the rv behind it that we had to get just because i had to fund tax
[2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:52.320]  our vehicles people laugh that announcement prove it correct did you just hear this epic information
[2:06:52.320 --> 2:06:58.560]  i just laid out yeah alex i was actually excited to come on here and potentially break that with
[2:06:58.560 --> 2:07:02.480]  you because i know you know the crew is busy in there but of course they caught it as the crew
[2:07:02.480 --> 2:07:06.720]  always does so you know alex it's exactly what we knew was going to happen it's exactly what we
[2:07:06.720 --> 2:07:13.600]  suspected you know when the announcement is going to be made they've already taken pennsylvania from
[2:07:13.600 --> 2:07:18.400]  biden uh when is the announcement going to be made that trump won it how long is this legal
[2:07:18.400 --> 2:07:23.120]  process going to take how long is this process of getting the legal votes counted and the illegal
[2:07:23.120 --> 2:07:28.880]  votes removed going to take if this is something that gets fast tracked and we have something by
[2:07:28.880 --> 2:07:33.520]  saturday can you imagine the energy that's going to be in dc it's going to be a total
[2:07:33.520 --> 2:07:39.440]  upheaval of the establishment and america we the people roaring louder than ever before so
[2:07:40.640 --> 2:07:45.600]  what's the left's going to do just as loud as we're roaring uh you saw brennan he's afraid i
[2:07:45.600 --> 2:07:50.640]  think obama has been afraid for a long time he know he got caught so what are they going to gas
[2:07:50.640 --> 2:07:58.640]  like their minions into doing uh as we embark now on this battle to get the country to understand
[2:07:58.640 --> 2:08:04.720]  no joe biden did not win he never won trump won in a landslide and you're going to have to face
[2:08:04.720 --> 2:08:11.600]  that fact but how how diabolical how demonic of the democrat party to fake the election results
[2:08:11.600 --> 2:08:16.480]  with the mainstream news and then have the celebration of joe biden with the fireworks and
[2:08:16.480 --> 2:08:21.120]  everything they're looking like a plastic corks with a baby and all this and to make fun of we
[2:08:21.120 --> 2:08:29.200]  know they're all bunch of pitos how reckless is it how reckless is it well they know they're
[2:08:29.200 --> 2:08:34.720]  going to get what they want alex they wanted to get their base that hit of dopamine and it's
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:40.400]  going to be like a meth head or a crack addict who's been on a bender for just weeks and weeks
[2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:45.840]  and weeks because they think biden won so they're sitting here on this high oh we beat trump oh we
[2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:50.240]  beat america oh we had our victory and it's going to be totally removed it's going to be like a drug
[2:08:50.240 --> 2:08:55.680]  addict uh you know after a week long bender having to get sober and it's not going to run and scare
[2:08:55.680 --> 2:09:00.320]  because they put a patreon is the new secretary of defense they put a real patreon in there they're
[2:09:00.320 --> 2:09:06.720]  crapping bricks right now so you've had donald trump the president of the united states declare
[2:09:06.720 --> 2:09:12.080]  he's won you've now had essentially for all intensive purposes mike Pompeo the secretary of
[2:09:12.080 --> 2:09:18.480]  defense claim he's won and you have about 70 million americans i think millions of which
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:25.600]  could be in dc this weekend claiming trump won so uh you know this whole thing stay there stay there
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:29.680]  we're gonna play the Pompeo and go back to you oh and but i'm gonna tell listeners now listen
[2:09:30.800 --> 2:09:34.880]  if you're in florida you get your ass up to tallahassee at eight tonight and join our caravan
[2:09:34.880 --> 2:09:39.120]  if you're in inlandia be there tomorrow be there and go to dc i don't care what you're doing there's
[2:09:39.120 --> 2:09:45.840]  no future if you don't we need thousands of vehicles do it now for those drinking the global
[2:09:45.840 --> 2:09:51.520]  is kool-aid what i call the invincibly ignorant there is no hope but for those of you that care
[2:09:51.520 --> 2:09:57.200]  and are informed we have more than hope we have history on our side if we take action and if we
[2:09:57.200 --> 2:10:03.440]  spread the truth i have been warning everyone of exactly what was going to come in the exact order
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:08.080]  how did i do that because the globalist war game at all in public and prepare the public
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:13.520]  with brainwashing on msn when they put out the 80 million ballots we knew it was so
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:17.600]  they could stuff it after the polls closed that's why they got federal courts to rule
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:23.600]  to keep it open for weeks of need being again it was so simple and of course you see the media
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:28.560]  heat up saying trump did a bad job on covet and that once biden was called president-elect
[2:10:28.560 --> 2:10:34.160]  he would order trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit that he needs a second lockdown
[2:10:34.160 --> 2:10:38.320]  and if he doesn't go under biden's immediate control and put that lockdown in place he'll try
[2:10:38.320 --> 2:10:42.400]  to remove the president with a 25th amendment and all of that is a trick trump to take the
[2:10:42.400 --> 2:10:47.600]  blame for covet that's chinese it's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one

[2:12:11.760 --> 2:12:18.880]  the hobbyists he joined al-qaeda that's the lobbyist brennan so scared going leading to
[2:12:18.880 --> 2:12:24.160]  be concerned quomo trumps like a corner tiger and he just got a new secretary of defense
[2:12:24.160 --> 2:12:30.160]  and and and and then pompeo comes out and says we're gonna have a second trump administration
[2:12:30.160 --> 2:12:33.680]  we've got the election fraud because we know we've got them dead to rights these crazy people
[2:12:34.400 --> 2:12:38.000]  here's the problem because they didn't get in trouble for russia gate ukraine gate spy gate
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:45.440]  all the rest of it impeachment gate they did it again this time even bigger and crazier big tech
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:51.840]  got away with all the spying and censorship so they went further and and so it looks like
[2:12:51.840 --> 2:12:56.560]  trumps gonna fight it so we're gonna fight it this is what do we call the 79 days of hell
[2:12:56.560 --> 2:13:01.040]  the 79 days of hell for everybody but credit jesus folks this is such an incredible time
[2:13:01.760 --> 2:13:06.480]  let's uh here is uh what the secretary of state pompeo had to say showing he's not cutting and
[2:13:06.480 --> 2:13:10.800]  running and you know what it's like they say in full metal jacket private joker's silly
[2:13:10.800 --> 2:13:14.400]  needs ignorant but he's got guts and guts is enough well pompeo's not silly and ignorant
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:18.000]  he's a very shrewd person and the fact that he's sticking with trump shows you we are not
[2:13:18.000 --> 2:13:24.800]  out of the game yet here's the club there will be a smooth transition to a second trump administration
[2:13:26.560 --> 2:13:31.040]  right we're ready the world is watching what's taking place here we're going to count all the
[2:13:31.040 --> 2:13:36.320]  votes when the process is complete there'll be electors selected there's a process the constitution
[2:13:36.320 --> 2:13:41.120]  lays it out pretty clearly the world should have every confidence that the transition necessary
[2:13:41.120 --> 2:13:45.840]  to make sure that the state department is functional today successful today and successful
[2:13:45.840 --> 2:13:51.920]  with the president who's in office on january 20th a minute afternoon will also be successful
[2:13:51.920 --> 2:13:55.280]  i went through a transition on the front and i've been on the other side of this
[2:13:55.280 --> 2:13:59.280]  i'm very confident that we will do all the things that are necessary to make sure that
[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:02.480]  the the government the united states government will continue to perform as national security
[2:14:02.480 --> 2:14:06.880]  function as we go forward so you believe there's widespread voter fraud that the reports that
[2:14:06.880 --> 2:14:12.160]  we're getting from pennsylvania from michigan showing vote totals and nasa leads are significant
[2:14:12.160 --> 2:14:17.760]  leads with 99 percent reporting now they're going to be overturned and that the united states failed
[2:14:17.760 --> 2:14:23.680]  to conduct a fraudulent free election rich i'm the secretary of state i'm getting calls from
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:28.160]  all across the world these people are watching our election they understand that we have a
[2:14:28.160 --> 2:14:34.720]  legal process they understand that this takes time right took us 37 plus days in an election back
[2:14:34.720 --> 2:14:41.680]  in 2000 conducted a successful transition then i'm very confident that we will count and we must
[2:14:41.680 --> 2:14:45.120]  count every legal vote we must make sure that any vote that wasn't lawful on not be counted
[2:14:45.120 --> 2:14:50.480]  that dilutes your vote if it's done improperly gotta get that right when we get it right we'll
[2:14:50.480 --> 2:14:54.800]  get it right by the way i don't agree with socialism but the mexican president they have
[2:14:54.800 --> 2:15:00.640]  in now was anti-trump after he met with him for three hours he came out of the meeting he said i
[2:15:00.640 --> 2:15:05.040]  like trump because trump said listen i wouldn't power poor people if you you say you're a socialist
[2:15:05.040 --> 2:15:09.600]  that doesn't work we're gonna do it he had an election stolen from him and then one later
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:13.360]  he's come out and endorsed trump basically and said you can't do this it looks like fraud
[2:15:13.360 --> 2:15:18.560]  that's what this is folks it happened they've been caught the socialist mexican president
[2:15:18.560 --> 2:15:24.640]  is supporting trump so they can stonewall all day long they can play games all day long
[2:15:24.640 --> 2:15:28.880]  we know we got a populist president is trying to cut a better deal for us and if they think
[2:15:28.880 --> 2:15:31.360]  they're gonna take this from us they got a big problem i want to show your takeover
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:41.360]  being of america and i think that most of the audience members that are hearing this transmission
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:49.440]  right now could probably point to a specific time or story or incident that woke them up or
[2:15:49.440 --> 2:15:55.280]  red pill moment as some people call it i think this is one of the biggest we've seen since the
[2:15:55.280 --> 2:16:02.400]  election of trump oh it's bigger than all of them combined this is this is the big red pill the
[2:16:02.400 --> 2:16:06.880]  blatant right in front of your eyes election theft and you know here's the thing i've got family and
[2:16:06.880 --> 2:16:10.960]  friends alex that uh you know they're conservative they have conservative values but they're not
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:14.160]  really politically charged you know they go about their life they're not really thinking
[2:16:14.160 --> 2:16:21.920]  about politics oh who wins loses the election okay fine whatever well those people who are in neutral
[2:16:21.920 --> 2:16:26.880]  have just been shifted into high gear and and everyone's panicked hey what whoa we don't have
[2:16:26.880 --> 2:16:32.400]  fair elections hey what is this in michigan with a vertical i'm calling it uh political
[2:16:32.400 --> 2:16:36.800]  viagra for joe biden in michigan where it just goes straight up it's just magic
[2:16:36.800 --> 2:16:41.200]  same things happen in wisconsin and people say wait a second this isn't right they see them counting
[2:16:41.200 --> 2:16:56.480]  in pennsylvania and well we lost going that's okay right we're not decided to buy into a delicious
[2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:03.440]  cheesy hamburger by the way i've never been into a hamburger it tastes so good but all this
[2:17:03.440 --> 2:17:09.440]  news has just been breaking i want shroyer is back i want to keep going just fail alex i kind of want
[2:17:09.440 --> 2:17:17.200]  that hamburger now i'm thinking about using him right now let me take over you enjoy yeah you enjoy
[2:17:17.200 --> 2:17:23.280]  that so i'm thinking that this the stealing of this election from trump because everybody saw
[2:17:23.280 --> 2:17:28.800]  the rallies folks i mean for even even the graphs that show how it was rigged even them voting for
[2:17:28.800 --> 2:17:33.920]  a whole week in pennsylvania until biden was ahead i mean people saw the rallies they saw
[2:17:33.920 --> 2:17:37.760]  trump supporters they've never seen people so politically activated they've never seen people
[2:17:37.760 --> 2:17:43.120]  so politically charged they've never seen people with so much enthusiasm for a president so so even
[2:17:43.120 --> 2:17:47.600]  just general observers are seeing that this was completely stolen from trump and they're not buying
[2:17:47.600 --> 2:17:53.440]  it and the mainstream news including fox news has already sullied their reputation to such a point
[2:17:53.440 --> 2:18:00.640]  where everything they report is having less and less of an impact every day and so they report
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:05.840]  joe biden won they have a little fake ceremony nobody's buying it and they're gonna look really
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:10.160]  foolish when president trump has announced the winner which it could be as soon as saturday i
[2:18:10.160 --> 2:18:14.720]  think it may take a longer process than that with the legal battle that's ahead but uh trump will
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:19.200]  be announced the winner of the 2020 election and these people are gonna have to admit that they
[2:18:19.200 --> 2:18:25.520]  fall for fake news again but because of all this energy because of all this outreach to info wars
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:33.200]  and because of so many people fired up to stop the steal we had the massive event in austin texas
[2:18:33.200 --> 2:18:38.720]  on saturday thousands of people showed up and then we carried that momentum onto the stop the
[2:18:38.720 --> 2:18:44.800]  steal caravan which we just departed from baton rouge louisiana we were at the state capitol

[2:20:39.440 --> 2:20:45.040]  going to be in belluxy beautiful we love you probably about the problem with social Darwinism
[2:20:45.040 --> 2:20:53.440]  is the so-called elites the most cunning smart inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't
[2:20:53.440 --> 2:20:57.760]  exist anymore they don't believe in being aristocrats trying to hold up civilization and power the
[2:20:57.760 --> 2:21:03.200]  people and once the establishment has that predatory idea civilization collapses very very
[2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:07.840]  quickly you can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that
[2:21:08.640 --> 2:21:14.160]  and so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us the globalists can try to be heartless
[2:21:14.160 --> 2:21:19.760]  devil or spurs that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crime try to get away from a humanity but
[2:21:19.760 --> 2:21:25.280]  really they can't escape the laws of the universe they may train themselves to commit heinous crimes
[2:21:25.280 --> 2:21:30.400]  and not feel it themselves but the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them
[2:21:30.400 --> 2:21:36.080]  and their families and the very structure itself wealth is created by loving god wealth is created
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:41.600]  by having a connection to god god is the source of all creation all success all power we deny that

[2:21:56.880 --> 2:22:00.240]  essential without them you die and studies show you really need the other ones too but dna force
[2:22:00.240 --> 2:22:05.120]  goes beyond that it helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with pqq and coq10 of the

[2:22:10.800 --> 2:22:15.760]  that stuff can get in viruses don't get in the good stuff gets in because the NIH website says
[2:22:15.760 --> 2:22:19.520]  that if you have all the proper things they can't replicate like they could but i do this because

[2:25:02.080 --> 2:25:07.440]  we just had pompeo come out and say will be a smooth transition the second trump administration
[2:25:07.440 --> 2:25:14.880]  because of election fraud you've got the former head of the cia admitted communist admitted
[2:25:14.880 --> 2:25:20.960]  will hobbyist brennan looking totally scared on tv saying oh no he's just trump's a cornered tiger
[2:25:20.960 --> 2:25:25.040]  he just replaced the secretary of defense we're in trouble i'll go back to oan shroyer who's riding
[2:25:25.040 --> 2:25:30.880]  along the highway there about to get into florida tallahassee united 830 to really rally with folks
[2:25:30.880 --> 2:25:35.120]  to go up to the capital this saturday trump's counting all you you patriots out there not
[2:25:35.120 --> 2:25:38.640]  just wave your flags in florida we know florida's great we're counting on florida that's why we
[2:25:38.640 --> 2:25:44.560]  took that route to drive up there with us the next few days but stewart roads you were coming on
[2:25:44.560 --> 2:25:51.040]  about the rallies and the caravan and the event sun saturday it's important but how big is it
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:56.240]  to have brennan firing the bat signal saying we're in deep trouble he put a new sec def in
[2:25:56.240 --> 2:26:02.000]  oh my god pompeo says hey trump will be the next president they're fraudulent they've been gaslighting
[2:26:02.000 --> 2:26:07.440]  us you i mean this is an insane time to be alive stewart roads because obviously they're trying
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:10.560]  to get everybody right now to turn over to the globalists they're putting incredible pressure
[2:26:10.560 --> 2:26:16.560]  on people you know pompeo's had pressure put on him he's a survivor uh and and so to have pompeo
[2:26:16.560 --> 2:26:20.960]  still siding with trump and being very confident is a big sign what do you have to say stewart
[2:26:20.960 --> 2:26:26.560]  roads founder of oath keepers army veteran former lawyer you name it well i think he's on the verge
[2:26:26.560 --> 2:26:30.480]  of doing what i've been calling on president trump to do for at least six months which is to
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:34.640]  classify all the dirty secrets to throw him out in the street that's why it's awesome to see don
[2:26:34.640 --> 2:26:39.360]  jr saying that just the other day now you posted on twitter to classify every oh i'm sorry i should
[2:26:39.360 --> 2:26:44.800]  have agreed you can beat the drum for months weaponize this even before the election declassify
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:49.280]  it destroy brennan as a foreign agent destroy hunter destroy biden now and trump knows this is
[2:26:49.280 --> 2:26:53.280]  only moved and that's why they're now calling for a coup to remove trump because he's finally
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:57.840]  moving towards victory continue that's how you let's take it over the target he has to do it
[2:26:57.840 --> 2:27:01.280]  um i think he needs to do that right now he has full authority his commander and chief
[2:27:01.280 --> 2:27:05.920]  and the president no one can stop him brennan realizes that that's why they're panicking
[2:27:05.920 --> 2:27:12.800]  and the words of emperor palpatine do it he needs to do it doesn't he he does and like you know
[2:27:12.800 --> 2:27:16.800]  that's why i think it's great i think i think he's heard the message uh that's what don jr posted
[2:27:16.800 --> 2:27:23.280]  on twitter to classify everything we can't let the bad actors get away with it and so i gotta
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:29.120]  say steward i don't over hype things i watch the body language of brennan he is shitting bricks
[2:27:29.120 --> 2:27:35.200]  right now good and what he needs to do is he needs to have socom he's he's got a good socom
[2:27:35.200 --> 2:27:40.720]  man now in charge of the secretary of defense but he needs to put socom in charge of going and
[2:27:40.720 --> 2:27:47.520]  taking control and securing all the facilities where all the data is and he cannot even trust the d
[2:27:47.520 --> 2:27:53.760]  and i he cannot trust the normal military um intelligence services he must go to the socom
[2:27:53.760 --> 2:27:58.320]  he must put his warriors front and center and have them secure the data and they have a socom
[2:27:58.320 --> 2:28:03.680]  intelligence officers process it and follow his orders because otherwise they will drag their
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:09.280]  feet on and i agree and he's to do it now he needs to resolute desk announce it declare total war
[2:28:09.280 --> 2:28:14.080]  and the enemy will turn and run fear exactly and the next thing he needs to do after that is he
[2:28:14.080 --> 2:28:20.160]  needs to do a wiki leaks a snowden style and doing an asan style data dump because here's the deal
[2:28:20.160 --> 2:28:24.960]  if it was an american deep state overthrowing trump i'd still fight it it's a chi-com new world
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:31.760]  order great reset global depression attack our families castrate our son's program we must oppose
[2:28:31.760 --> 2:28:38.320]  this to it well president trump has a very narrow window to stand up and do the right thing by defeating
[2:28:38.320 --> 2:28:42.880]  the deep state by draining the swamp as he promised to do because if he does not do that if he fails to
[2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:47.520]  do this and he allows himself to be removed illegitimately or he's talked into it i you know
[2:28:47.520 --> 2:28:51.360]  we're now hearing the cushioner is in his ear oh they're always going to come after him none of
[2:28:51.360 --> 2:28:57.200]  their deals are going to fit so how does trump nuke the how does he nuke the deep state he does
[2:28:57.200 --> 2:29:02.640]  the mass declassification um of course he doesn't declassify anything to put americans um you know
[2:29:02.640 --> 2:29:07.200]  patriotic americans at risk overseas but that's the problem there's so many crimes but at the
[2:29:07.200 --> 2:29:13.520]  targeted release start with hillary start with obama start with all of it just destroy them well
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:18.400]  no i would say both left and right you've got you've got deep state controlled judges i would
[2:29:18.400 --> 2:29:22.960]  consider roberts one of them you've got deep state controlled puppets all through the media
[2:29:22.960 --> 2:29:28.800]  through academia through politics so justice be done may the heavens fall exactly right you know
[2:29:28.800 --> 2:29:33.600]  like i said don't don't put lives at risk overseas guys that are in theater but here at home domestically
[2:29:33.600 --> 2:29:38.480]  no shelter for them let's be clear obama already six years ago gave the personnel
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:42.320]  office of management hacked the chai comms so this has already been done to our enemies a full
[2:29:42.320 --> 2:29:47.600]  data dump how about give the world the truth right you do the data dump and you and you put it out
[2:29:47.600 --> 2:29:51.760]  there for the american people to see and then we'll all know exactly who the pedophiles are
[2:29:51.760 --> 2:29:56.320]  who all the well the ball isn't he isn't the threat of this his real kill switch why do you think
[2:29:56.320 --> 2:30:02.560]  pompeo looks so confident but almost psychotic and then brendan looks like he's dying well i mean
[2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:09.040]  here's the problem using this as a negotiation tool to make them back off and not continue to
[2:30:09.040 --> 2:30:15.360]  seal the election is not enough he needs to defeat them by he needs to fire the freaking death star
[2:30:16.240 --> 2:30:20.800]  exactly right go ahead and just do it and when he does that all their all their house of cars
[2:30:20.800 --> 2:30:26.320]  will fall they will all fall we will all see who they are and it's like dropping atomic bombs on
[2:30:26.320 --> 2:30:32.080]  erishima nagasaki that's right and then he needs to invoke the insurrection act and use the military
[2:30:32.080 --> 2:30:35.280]  and i you know in the past have been opposed using the military domestically for for this
[2:30:35.280 --> 2:30:39.680]  purpose he needs to use the military like i said because it's we were worried about globalists
[2:30:39.680 --> 2:30:43.360]  using the military against us which is going to happen this is globalist overthrowing our
[2:30:43.360 --> 2:30:48.400]  government we better have the military stop the globalist well have them at least do this have
[2:30:48.400 --> 2:30:52.880]  them go and secure the data and secure the facilities and suppress the deep state who are
[2:30:52.880 --> 2:30:57.200]  inside you're right they're so scared this former special operations commander has been hired for

[2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:27.360]  but we're not gonna let that happen it's not even if it's it's either president trump is encouraged
[2:32:27.360 --> 2:32:32.560]  and bolstered strength in the do what he must do or we wind up in a in a bloody fight we all know
[2:32:32.560 --> 2:32:38.960]  that the fight's coming but he has a chance to fix this very quickly um with by by defaying the snake

[2:33:42.640 --> 2:33:47.280]  talk about tomorrow's news today this is all very transparent when you war game it out
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:53.120]  six months ago info was predicted the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from
[2:33:53.120 --> 2:33:58.400]  prompt they would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had
[2:33:58.400 --> 2:34:03.040]  in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory and now that happened now
[2:34:03.040 --> 2:34:07.920]  what else did i predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night all on record
[2:34:07.920 --> 2:34:14.000]  that when joe biden was president-elect via fraud trump would challenge it but biden's next move
[2:34:14.000 --> 2:34:19.520]  would be to form his own covet task force say that trump is inept and has killed 267 thousand
[2:34:19.520 --> 2:34:25.360]  americans which is it true and demand trump's removal via the 25th amendment if he doesn't let
[2:34:25.360 --> 2:34:30.160]  joe biden's new covet task force give all the new orders they'll tell trump that if he backs down
[2:34:30.160 --> 2:34:33.840]  and follows their orders and steps down they won't blame him for coven but if he doesn't
[2:34:33.840 --> 2:34:37.120]  they're going to blame him for coven but then if he does do what they say he's talking about him
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:42.640]  anyways plus this is meant for marshal law destroy the economy i warned you all communist china has
[2:34:42.640 --> 2:34:47.280]  been fully open for business for more than six months but the european union and every other
[2:34:47.280 --> 2:34:52.560]  major western nation is still under some form of lockdown and the lockdowns are getting more
[2:34:52.560 --> 2:34:56.480]  intense and people are being told they're gonna be arrested if they leave their houses just like
[2:34:56.480 --> 2:35:03.280]  we've seen in australia you see the authoritarians want total control and because they don't respect
[2:35:03.280 --> 2:35:08.720]  this because the general public puts up with so much abuse they're going for broke why shouldn't
[2:35:08.720 --> 2:35:12.880]  they they never get in trouble for the big illegal wars they never get in trouble for the chinese
[2:35:12.880 --> 2:35:17.760]  slave camps they never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in africa they never get in
[2:35:17.760 --> 2:35:23.280]  trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country and so why shouldn't they
[2:35:23.280 --> 2:35:28.640]  go for broke because so many people are domesticated and they're soft and they have stocco syndrome
[2:35:28.640 --> 2:35:34.400]  they love their abusers they can't believe they're being lied to they can't believe they're being conned
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:39.680]  and so they're going into bondage you see there's always a minority that says no and enforces that
[2:35:39.680 --> 2:35:48.160]  minority the miraculous properties of tumeric have been admired even worshiped for thousands of
[2:35:48.160 --> 2:35:53.840]  years by ancient civilizations with modern science we know why tumeric is so popular its
[2:35:53.840 --> 2:36:01.120]  antioxidant effect its anti-inflammatory effect everything it does is simply amazing and most
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:08.320]  tumerics out there are simply food products they're three to five percent curcuminoid but we have
[2:36:08.320 --> 2:36:15.600]  bodies ultimate tumeric formula with a 95 percent curcuminoid level and we have other
[2:36:15.600 --> 2:36:19.680]  organic products in there that accelerate it and bring it into the cells of the body

[2:36:44.400 --> 2:36:50.080]  koolaid what i call the invincibly ignorant there is no hope but for those of you that care and
[2:36:50.080 --> 2:36:56.000]  are informed we have more than hope we have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the
[2:36:56.000 --> 2:37:02.320]  truth i have been warning everyone of exactly what was going to come in the exact order how did i
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:07.440]  do that because the globalist wargame at all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing
[2:37:07.440 --> 2:37:13.120]  on msn when they put out the 80 million balance we knew it was so they could stuff it after the
[2:37:13.120 --> 2:37:19.040]  polls closed that's why they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks of need being again
[2:37:19.040 --> 2:37:24.480]  it was so simple and of course you see the media heat up saying trump did a bad job on covid and
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:30.320]  that once biden was quote president elect he would order trump to admit that he did a bad job
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:34.960]  and admit that he needs a second lockdown and if he doesn't go under biden's immediate control
[2:37:34.960 --> 2:37:39.200]  and put that lockdown in place he'll try to remove the president with a 25th amendment and all of
[2:37:39.200 --> 2:37:55.120]  that is a trick trump to take the blame for covid that's chinese you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:37:55.120 --> 2:38:11.200]  this is coming
[2:38:11.200 --> 2:38:16.640]  florida's coming georgia virginia we're coming through tell us tonight i'm sure you heard

[2:38:22.240 --> 2:38:27.200]  multinational globalist takeover the country they plan to put in an endless lockdown and bankrupt us

[2:38:32.720 --> 2:38:37.120]  people are freaking out they're announcing the un to oversee our elections they're announcing world
[2:38:37.120 --> 2:38:41.680]  government they're announcing not just racism training for all white people but all boys we

[2:38:45.920 --> 2:38:49.600]  piece of paper saying they'll do it or they're racist and then the state claims they have a
[2:38:49.600 --> 2:38:55.280]  relationship with your son till they chop the balls off at uh at age eight i mean imagine if
[2:38:55.280 --> 2:38:59.440]  you told people like 30 years ago there'll be a cult of leftists that take your five-year-old to
[2:38:59.440 --> 2:39:04.320]  sign an agreement to have his balls chopped off because he said he's a male i mean this is a damn
[2:39:04.320 --> 2:39:12.560]  cult we must resist it on yeah well we are resisting it alex and i wanted to ask stewart
[2:39:12.560 --> 2:39:17.680]  roads a question now because as we've talked about the stop the steel caravans final destination

[2:39:23.360 --> 2:39:28.720]  landing in tallahassee tonight approximately 8 30 p.m. eastern but alex i wanted to ask stewart a
[2:39:28.720 --> 2:39:36.160]  question stewart we're going into total conquered territory in dc no guns allowed and now they
[2:39:36.160 --> 2:39:42.080]  have a co vid restriction protocol that you can't even be in dc without taking a test and you must
[2:39:42.080 --> 2:39:48.480]  go into quarantine immediately upon entering dc so as we entered this globalist we've all talked
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:53.600]  global cops it's all non-enforceable it's all the smoke screen it's all theater but go ahead go ahead
[2:39:53.600 --> 2:40:02.720]  start it's a good night i don't think we can cross to skype feet so kill all its feet while stewart
[2:40:02.720 --> 2:40:08.480]  talks let's start yeah we were in dc just the other night i was there in person on the ground
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:12.720]  just outside the white house and there were no checkpoints there was no requirement for any
[2:40:12.720 --> 2:40:17.920]  testing or anything like that so i would say uh just ignore any such nonsense that's being told
[2:40:17.920 --> 2:40:23.120]  and just to show up hey the radical left all over dc and mobs you know attacking people and
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:27.440]  sniping people so you can be there too yeah just tell them you're an illegal alien and you'll be
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:33.280]  fine oh and finish your question it yeah isn't that amazing though how they are trying to conquer
[2:40:33.280 --> 2:40:39.200]  dc and shut us down from going to dc i mean that's what this is all about they want to try to keep
[2:40:39.200 --> 2:40:44.080]  us out and and have us like uh you know go into quarantine i mean give me a break so i mean this
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:49.200]  is an epic battle that we're encroaching right now this weekend from like five years ago we had
[2:40:49.200 --> 2:40:54.240]  people protesting at debos they put a press release out saying people shouldn't have the money
[2:40:54.240 --> 2:40:59.360]  they'll come to switzerland go up a mountaintop and protest us and so they want to be able to have a
[2:40:59.360 --> 2:41:04.720]  covid lockdown wherever they're at but that's what this is it's all about big tech and their excuse
[2:41:04.720 --> 2:41:08.720]  no one would buy it they said was political reasons it's for viral reasons it's total hoax
[2:41:09.760 --> 2:41:15.840]  yeah and it's a people try stopping a million americans yeah yeah good luck with that if you
[2:41:15.840 --> 2:41:19.440]  like trying to put tech points outside of vondie range that wouldn't work either so they even don't
[2:41:19.440 --> 2:41:25.040]  even try it if we have to we'll swim the botomac so just just go there uh don't be afraid show up
[2:41:25.040 --> 2:41:28.720]  that's what they fear most is you showing up that's why they're trying to suppress that by putting
[2:41:28.720 --> 2:41:33.280]  up this nonsense that you can't go there without being tested because they know as patriots we
[2:41:33.280 --> 2:41:38.320]  follow directives that's illegal that mayors of communist fraud we're going to dc now more people
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:42.960]  need to come that's right this is what they fear the most is people standing up and there's an

[2:42:50.960 --> 2:42:55.360]  clear that all the other lawyers that were there with very few exceptions didn't do their jobs on
[2:42:55.360 --> 2:43:00.240]  purpose oh yeah right here we're learning in detroit we're learning uh we're learning in arizona

[2:43:14.640 --> 2:43:19.760]  white house as roger stone laid out in his his blistering um open statement about what's going
[2:43:19.760 --> 2:43:24.960]  off what's going on around trump is he has not successfully purged out the deep state all around
[2:43:24.960 --> 2:43:28.960]  him and they're still right there in his ear right now his own son-in-law is whispering in his ear
[2:43:28.960 --> 2:43:35.040]  they must concede and he can run again in 2024 we got a something message to him that no now is the
[2:43:35.040 --> 2:43:40.080]  time to stand now is the time to defeat them and he has the tools in his hands right now don't wait
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:45.040]  for any future potential future do it now and they are so scared of this they're stealing it they
[2:43:45.040 --> 2:43:49.440]  think you're a joke they want to put a dictatorship in a covet dictatorship this could totally
[2:43:49.440 --> 2:43:53.920]  blow up in their face but everyone listening has to get on a plane everyone listening if you're in

[2:48:28.880 --> 2:48:34.960]  hour number four straight in the control corporate media are mouthpieces for any big
[2:48:34.960 --> 2:48:40.320]  corporation or government that'll pay them it's that simple and then use our open free society
[2:48:40.320 --> 2:48:44.640]  against us the control media will talk about a few mistakes i've made over the years and
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:50.080]  obsess over it they see he's a liar on purpose even though our success rate our accuracy rate
[2:48:50.080 --> 2:48:54.720]  is way way better than theirs we try to tell the truth they try to lie they try to see
[2:48:55.600 --> 2:49:00.160]  i'm trying to get people to realize that the globalist operate how they manipulate how they
[2:49:01.360 --> 2:49:05.920]  bamboozle the public i'm trying to get the public to ask the questions and do not believe
[2:49:05.920 --> 2:49:12.720]  what they're told in the face i'm trying to get people to research for themselves the globalists
[2:49:12.720 --> 2:49:17.680]  of their control corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and
[2:49:17.680 --> 2:49:24.080]  as a conspiracy theory will again on its face that is a fraud question everything question info
[2:49:24.080 --> 2:49:28.320]  wars add your own research to it and then decide what you're going to promote to others and what
[2:49:28.320 --> 2:49:35.760]  new sources are accurate i believe info wars is the best source out there warning warning warning
[2:49:35.760 --> 2:49:42.800]  there is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover the giant third world collapse
[2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:47.920]  and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new covid lockdown announced by globalist
[2:49:47.920 --> 2:49:55.760]  systems in europe in asia and now in the united states joe bite is set to announce today that he
[2:49:55.760 --> 2:50:01.440]  has a new covid task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude
[2:50:01.440 --> 2:50:08.720]  contact tracing forced inoculations coming but most importantly a new lockdown that way he can
[2:50:08.720 --> 2:50:15.440]  say that trump is to blame for covid and claim that only a new lockdown will stop covid then of
[2:50:15.440 --> 2:50:20.160]  course when that new lockdown doesn't work those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going
[2:50:20.160 --> 2:50:24.560]  to be blamed for it and that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:30.800]  year this is a permanent martial law plan trump must be putiated exposed how she engaged and the
[2:50:30.800 --> 2:50:38.640]  un takeover not play games with it you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:45.440 --> 2:50:51.680]  we are living at the crossroads of human history every minute is like an hour every
[2:50:51.680 --> 2:50:58.880]  second like a day every year like a millennia every thousand years like eternity i am your
[2:50:58.880 --> 2:51:05.840]  host alex jones oh and shroyer and our crew is hurtling towards tallahassee at 8 30 to meet
[2:51:05.840 --> 2:51:11.200]  up with more patriots to ride to support our president and stand against the tyrants
[2:51:15.680 --> 2:51:21.760]  we're ready globalist and their propaganda is running out of gas
[2:51:21.760 --> 2:51:28.960]  a lot of exciting things are happening oh and shroyer final comments before paul joseph watson
[2:51:28.960 --> 2:51:41.440]  takes over now is the time now is the time where men become heroes and heroes are made
[2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:47.520]  and heroes become legend this is where men become men alex and it's been an honor to
[2:51:47.520 --> 2:51:51.840]  fight in this battle with you i hope we have a huge victory this weekend and i do expect us to have
[2:51:51.840 --> 2:51:57.760]  just that an update on the stop the steel caravan we are just under an hour outside of biloxi
[2:51:57.760 --> 2:52:04.880]  mississippi we may make a stop in or around biloxi mississippi a quick food stop so if people
[2:52:05.520 --> 2:52:10.720]  in and around biloxi want to hop on into our caravan that may be a good time and then we're
[2:52:10.720 --> 2:52:15.840]  going to hop on the i-10 keep heading east and just go right through to tallahassee florida
[2:52:15.840 --> 2:52:20.480]  where we're going to be at the state capitol building this evening 8 30 p.m eastern i'm hoping
[2:52:20.480 --> 2:52:26.960]  it's going to be a huge huge crowd like we had last night in houston roaring roaring for liberty
[2:52:26.960 --> 2:52:31.440]  roaring for america roaring don't agree and i'm not mentioning folks you know the 30 cars that
[2:52:31.440 --> 2:52:36.640]  follow you from austin or the 100 cars in houston that turn back at louisiana we need everybody to
[2:52:36.640 --> 2:52:41.120]  go all the way now folks this is the end of the country we need to see a giant caravan that the
[2:52:41.120 --> 2:52:45.680]  news picks up of hundreds and hundreds of cars become thousands and then everyone meets along the way
[2:52:45.680 --> 2:52:49.760]  and it's already happening folks are going to dc a lot of big groups but this is not a spectator
[2:52:49.760 --> 2:52:56.800]  thing this is do it now well i don't expect any news to cover this the news wants to ignore anything
[2:52:56.800 --> 2:53:02.240]  pro it's kind of pathetic the people's business well the people showed up alex that's the beauty
[2:53:02.240 --> 2:53:06.560]  of it the people show up with their own independent news channels like just another channel dot com a
[2:53:06.560 --> 2:53:11.920]  bunch of local reporters just individuals freelance journalists showed up at baton rouge louisiana i
[2:53:11.920 --> 2:53:15.600]  expect it will be the same in tallahassee because the mainstream news doesn't want to cover the
[2:53:15.600 --> 2:53:20.880]  american restoration the american revolution 2.0 we knew that would happen that's beautiful so this
[2:53:20.880 --> 2:53:28.080]  is in uh where is this we are i i think we may still be in louisiana are we still in louisiana
[2:53:28.080 --> 2:53:32.880]  guys yeah we're still in louisiana but we're approaching mississippi as we speak and like
[2:53:32.880 --> 2:53:37.360]  i said under an hour outside of eluxin we're showing a lot of footage of fans along the road
[2:53:37.360 --> 2:53:43.520]  as you're driving oh yeah we've had people along the road people drive by hawking at us waving
[2:53:43.520 --> 2:53:49.520]  flags and everything so uh this is uh this is american revolution 2.0 the restoration of america
[2:53:49.520 --> 2:53:54.960]  and i think that the swamp the corrupt criminals from dc know they're in big trouble and if we
[2:53:54.960 --> 2:54:01.040]  show up huge for president trump this weekend millions strong it's the total mandate it's the
[2:54:01.040 --> 2:54:06.880]  total fuel that trump needs to finally drain this swamp before as secretary of defense mike
[2:54:06.880 --> 2:54:12.000]  pompeo said a smooth transition into the next four years which i don't think he would have said
[2:54:12.000 --> 2:54:16.560]  unless he knew that swamp was going to get drained well it just shows that not everybody's rolling
[2:54:16.560 --> 2:54:20.640]  over on the president we're putting a fight up i mean the sick part of me a mac de velli inside
[2:54:20.640 --> 2:54:25.120]  which i try to keep caged up hopes they put biden and actually try this down the road it's
[2:54:25.120 --> 2:54:29.680]  even worse for them i mean they are just such a bunch of scum but i want to fix this peacefully
[2:54:29.680 --> 2:54:32.720]  and i don't want to go down that road so this is going to be an incredible moment
[2:54:32.720 --> 2:54:37.040]  tallahassee florida night that you guys are up where to georgia next then into virginia

[2:56:50.800 --> 2:57:01.200]  you are listening to paul joseph watson and we are live on this fourth hour of the show
[2:57:01.200 --> 2:57:07.680]  we're gonna get into the latest in the litigation concerning the recount the election attempt to
[2:57:07.680 --> 2:57:12.800]  actually count the legitimate votes which is a very important process much to the chagrin of the
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:19.920]  mainstream media which has declined it's decided to give itself to anoint itself with the power
[2:57:19.920 --> 2:57:26.560]  of declaring the next president that's not the case the power is with the electors and the recounts
[2:57:26.560 --> 2:57:32.240]  are going to continue the litigation is going to continue for the next few days and indeed weeks
[2:57:32.240 --> 2:57:39.280]  but of course biden has basically come out and his transition team which is basically asserted
[2:57:39.280 --> 2:57:44.160]  power as they said they would do before the election to give biden that legitimacy of power
[2:57:44.880 --> 2:57:53.120]  have come out and said that lockdown 2.0 for the united states is on its way interesting fact the
[2:57:53.120 --> 2:58:02.000]  earliest known use of the term lockdown was in a 1973 fresno beat newspaper article and it referred
[2:58:02.000 --> 2:58:10.080]  to prisoners being kept in their cells after a knife attack so the very origin of the term
[2:58:10.080 --> 2:58:18.160]  lockdown was in the context of an unruly population being kept behind bars by the authorities
[2:58:19.200 --> 2:58:23.440]  really makes you think really makes you think and today we're going to be talking about that
[2:58:23.440 --> 2:58:30.240]  i'm going to be talking about the great reset which again is not a conspiracy theory it's an open plan
[2:58:30.240 --> 2:58:36.560]  being proudly promulgated and promoted by the global elite by davos by the world economic forum
[2:58:37.440 --> 2:58:43.680]  headline up on bright part from james deling poll who i'm hopefully going to interview here in the
[2:58:43.680 --> 2:58:50.480]  near future only donald trump can save us from the great reset now this is a plan that's been in the
[2:58:50.480 --> 2:58:56.560]  works at least since 2016 this is not something that was just invented off the back of the
[2:58:56.560 --> 2:59:02.480]  convenient chinese coronavirus outbreak they've been planning for this for at least four years
[2:59:03.120 --> 2:59:10.000]  now the phrase for the great reset which they're using in the halls of global financial elite
[2:59:10.000 --> 2:59:16.880]  residences is build back better which of course is basically a code phrase for rebranding
[2:59:17.600 --> 2:59:24.240]  rejuvenating rejigging their failed new world order which again they're trying to reintroduce
[2:59:24.240 --> 2:59:30.720]  off the back of covid hysteria and i go back to it this survey time and time again because it
[2:59:30.720 --> 2:59:37.680]  exemplifies how much concentrated power the mainstream media has to influence people to
[2:59:37.680 --> 2:59:44.720]  reeducate people to brainwash people into becoming so hysterical that they believe this moral panic
[2:59:44.720 --> 2:59:52.240]  they believe that this virus which has a what 99.98 percent survival rate chance amongst people
[2:59:52.240 --> 2:59:58.800]  below the age of 75 without comorbidities is way more dangerous than it actually is
[2:59:59.600 --> 3:00:05.440]  they did a poll in the united states which found that the average american and some thought it was
[3:00:05.440 --> 3:00:12.720]  a higher number but the average american thinks that coronavirus has killed over 30 million americans
[3:00:13.440 --> 3:00:19.600]  similar case across the western world in the uk the average brit thinks that coronavirus has killed
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:27.120]  five million people in the uk it's actually killed less than 50 000 why do they believe that
[3:00:27.120 --> 3:00:34.000]  because they've been hysterically indoctrinated with this covid 19 hysteria and this is a long
[3:00:34.000 --> 3:00:42.240]  term plan and delin poll talks about it in his article and it's basically as i said a rebranding
[3:00:42.240 --> 3:00:48.800]  of this global neo feudalist system they're talking about nobody having property they're
[3:00:48.800 --> 3:00:54.880]  talking about redistribution of wealth but then when you look at how the wealth has already been
[3:00:54.880 --> 3:01:01.040]  redistributed since the start of the pandemic back in march as the lockdowns were introduced in the
[3:01:01.040 --> 3:01:09.120]  western world who has it benefited hasn't benefited the little people really has it it's benefited
[3:01:09.120 --> 3:01:15.680]  giant transnational corporations time and time again that's not redistributing the wealth even
[3:01:15.680 --> 3:01:23.040]  if you believe in that socialist utopian paradigm small businesses are going bust mass unemployment
[3:01:23.680 --> 3:01:31.440]  mass economic destruction across the western world and who benefits well that's the headline
[3:01:31.440 --> 3:01:37.840]  of this bright bar article who benefits amazon booms as lockdown crushes small business in britain
[3:01:37.840 --> 3:01:49.280]  amazon in the third quarter has seen its profits triple to 6.3 billion dollars that's a 37
[3:01:49.280 --> 3:01:55.680]  percent rise in sales globally why because the only shops that are open are online the only
[3:01:55.680 --> 3:02:02.000]  essential stores that you can go and visit to buy your food or the big box stores are the big
[3:02:02.000 --> 3:02:09.280]  transnational corporations in the in the uk it's supermarkets like asda which is owned by walmart
[3:02:09.280 --> 3:02:15.440]  and tesco which again is another giant transnational corporation everybody else is going bust so no
[3:02:15.440 --> 3:02:21.520]  they're not redistributing the wealth they're hoarding it they're centralizing it for themselves
[3:02:21.520 --> 3:02:28.560]  and that's what they plan to implement further if they get this great reset which again is just about
[3:02:28.560 --> 3:02:35.280]  lowering everyone's quality of life lowering everyone's economic standard and saying that you
[3:02:35.280 --> 3:02:40.400]  will no longer be able to own property they literally brag about that and talk about it
[3:02:40.400 --> 3:02:47.360]  in their own publications headline globalist claus schwab world will never return to normal
[3:02:47.360 --> 3:02:54.640]  after covet in his book covet 19 the great reset world economic forum globalist claus schwab
[3:02:54.640 --> 3:02:59.280]  who again is invested in all the vaccine production by the way asserts that the world will never
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:05.520]  return to normal despite him admitting that corona virus doesn't pose an existential threat
[3:03:05.520 --> 3:03:13.360]  they admit basically that the hysteria is way overhyped over exaggerated and it's deliberately
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:20.000]  done to scare people into going along with this agenda what is the agenda it's what they call
[3:03:20.000 --> 3:03:26.000]  a common pass they brag about it they show screenshots from this app that they're producing
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:32.400]  where it says before you're allowed to travel on airlines you have to take the covet PCR test
[3:03:32.400 --> 3:03:38.320]  and eventually you have to take the vaccine oh and by the way it's not just international
[3:03:38.320 --> 3:03:43.840]  airline travel uber now literally has a thing where if you don't wear a mask and the driver
[3:03:43.840 --> 3:03:50.240]  reports it's a central command the next time you try to use uber on your phone they make you take
[3:03:50.240 --> 3:03:56.400]  a selfie wearing the mask if you then get in the uber without a mask for a second time then your
[3:03:56.400 --> 3:04:03.600]  account is banned so this all ties into the d platforming the social credit score that we've
[3:04:03.600 --> 3:04:10.560]  seen introduced in china where the corona virus pandemic originated which again is based on the
[3:04:10.560 --> 3:04:17.760]  fact that it's not just your behavior it's your friend's behavior if you're being a good citizen
[3:04:17.760 --> 3:04:22.640]  and taking your vaccines and wearing your mask that's all good and well but then if your friend
[3:04:23.280 --> 3:04:29.920]  is flouting the corona virus restrictions well then that also affects your social credit score
[3:04:29.920 --> 3:04:37.440]  so it's this ominous demon-like program of ostracizing people from their own communities
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:44.000]  their own friends if they misbehave so again it's about incentivizing the prisoners guarding the other
[3:04:44.000 --> 3:04:51.440]  prisoners and making them submit to the new rules very very interesting given the fact that as we
[3:04:51.440 --> 3:04:58.160]  know the same people behind the corona virus pandemic hysteria the world economic forum
[3:04:58.160 --> 3:05:03.440]  ngo's transnational corporations the vaunted scientists which are giving our governments
[3:05:03.440 --> 3:05:09.120]  this terrible advice has proven wrong time and time again were the same people behind
[3:05:09.120 --> 3:05:17.440]  the global warming panic of the past two three decades in fact in 1993 the club of roams co
[3:05:17.440 --> 3:05:24.320]  co-founder alexander king wrote the first global revolution and he stated quote the common enemy
[3:05:24.320 --> 3:05:30.720]  of humanity is man in searching for a new enemy to unite as we came up with the idea that pollution
[3:05:30.720 --> 3:05:36.320]  the threat of global warming bamin and the like would fit the bill and what do we see once again
[3:05:36.320 --> 3:05:44.000]  with the same people who were behind this hysteria writing the ipcc un reports again
[3:05:44.000 --> 3:05:50.640]  man is the enemy where the super spreaders we need the technocratic global elite to tamp down
[3:05:50.640 --> 3:05:57.520]  on our freedoms not just freedom of speech but specifically freedom of mobility for this pandemic
[3:05:57.520 --> 3:06:04.640]  to go away very very macky of ellian program that they've got running and they openly admit to it
[3:06:06.160 --> 3:06:10.480]  so we're going to go on to talk about that more in the second segment also tie into the social
[3:06:10.480 --> 3:06:15.840]  credit score because of course we had the headline a few months ago over a few weeks ago actually
[3:06:16.400 --> 3:06:22.560]  public humiliation hitachi develops fish bubble to enforce social distancing so you're going to
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:30.080]  have an app connected to your phone which is then linked into sensors in public buildings in airports
[3:06:30.080 --> 3:06:36.080]  in sports stadiums wherever where you have a six meter bubble projected around you if someone
[3:06:36.080 --> 3:06:44.720]  violates that election 2020 is here and whether trump wins or loses we have all won by exposing the
[3:06:44.720 --> 3:06:50.800]  communist chinese by exposing the globalist by exposing the pedophile rings by exposing the
[3:06:50.800 --> 3:06:56.080]  fact this is really a fight between good versus evil now i'm personally a christian i believe in
[3:06:56.080 --> 3:07:00.080]  god and i know god's real and i've experienced it in my life believe you don't believe in god
[3:07:00.640 --> 3:07:04.960]  it's important to recognize that there is good in this world there is evil and there are people out
[3:07:04.960 --> 3:07:10.800]  there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing that and what i see happening across the
[3:07:10.800 --> 3:07:16.240]  spectrum of different political views is people finally get that they finally understand that
[3:07:16.240 --> 3:07:22.800]  they're not being naive anymore don't ever project your decency and your goodness on to other people
[3:07:22.800 --> 3:07:27.920]  until they've proven what they stand for and who they are where you're going to get hurt but those
[3:07:27.920 --> 3:07:32.000]  of you out there have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful
[3:07:32.000 --> 3:07:36.640]  will then come together with those organizations and support them like info wars because without
[3:07:36.640 --> 3:07:42.880]  your support info wars would not exist we're only here on air facing the globalist onslaught the
[3:07:42.880 --> 3:07:47.200]  dmc funded lawsuits and everything that's happening because of you when we built the only truly
[3:07:47.200 --> 3:07:52.320]  multimedia independent radio tv print film organization in the world that promotes the
[3:07:52.320 --> 3:07:56.560]  truth against the globalist we've had a devastating effect we're a national treasure you're a national
[3:07:56.560 --> 3:08:02.400]  treasure for supporting us and so go get a t-shirt go get a historic t-shirt we've got a funny one
[3:08:02.400 --> 3:08:06.960]  that's the biden groping a woman it's it's a woman's design shirt my wife really likes it she
[3:08:06.960 --> 3:08:10.960]  sent me this gift it's pretty cute here it is and it just you know it's a little historic thing i think
[3:08:10.960 --> 3:08:15.200]  trump's gonna win but if biden's able to steal it we'll be probably shut down pretty quick so it'll
[3:08:15.200 --> 3:08:19.360]  be historic thing to have you'll be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with
[3:08:19.360 --> 3:08:24.400]  graffiti with handbills you hand out and with non-compliance not paying taxes and pulling your
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:29.280]  kids out of the schools and uh just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct
[3:08:29.280 --> 3:08:33.920]  the criminal foreign takeover of america we've gotten to that point biden's we're nursing home i hope
[3:08:33.920 --> 3:08:38.080]  to retire biden that'd be a collector's item get it while you still can we're not ordering more info
[3:08:38.080 --> 3:08:44.800]  war store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:57.040]  you're listening to the summit dot news radio hour with paul joseph watson
[3:08:57.040 --> 3:09:07.680]  the great research is an efficient global feudalism that goes much farther than its medieval
[3:09:07.680 --> 3:09:15.120]  brother since the scanner is all seen every person every mineral every berry is digitally
[3:09:15.120 --> 3:09:20.640]  tagged and tracked under that framework every peasant has a function that is derived not from
[3:09:20.640 --> 3:09:28.400]  the mystery of life and not from their inner calling but from artificial intelligence the master
[3:09:28.400 --> 3:09:35.600]  of efficiency and the servant of the king ideally the peasants can be convinced that it's good for
[3:09:35.600 --> 3:09:42.560]  them or necessary to be safe as in contact tracing and that this is what progress and happiness is
[3:09:42.560 --> 3:09:49.200]  like but if not there are other ways from classic violence to virtual prisons to morality pills
[3:09:49.200 --> 3:09:55.600]  to sum up the desired end result is a giant joyless highly controlled global conveyor of
[3:09:55.600 --> 3:10:01.920]  everything and every body where privacy is tremendously expensive descent is unthinkable
[3:10:01.920 --> 3:10:09.920]  and spiritual submission is mandatory that's a description of the great reset that we're dealing
[3:10:09.920 --> 3:10:15.280]  with that we face that's being openly announced by the global elite in the aftermath of the first
[3:10:15.280 --> 3:10:21.200]  lockdown and in anticipation of the second lockdown and that's from an article on zero hedge
[3:10:21.200 --> 3:10:29.200]  called the great reset for dummies now talking about the social credit score and how they integrate
[3:10:29.200 --> 3:10:34.720]  the covid restrictions and the compliance with the covid restrictions because of course so far
[3:10:34.720 --> 3:10:42.400]  we've seen polls that show for example in the uk i think it was 70 plus supported the decision by
[3:10:42.400 --> 3:10:47.280]  the government to lock down for a second time despite the fact that it obviously didn't work
[3:10:47.280 --> 3:10:53.520]  the first time because now we've got a second wave in sweden they developed herd immunity now
[3:10:53.520 --> 3:10:58.640]  they've got the lowest death rate in europe didn't shut down their economy they've got the best gdp
[3:10:58.640 --> 3:11:04.240]  recovery in europe across the board but now we're entering a second lockdown indeed i've already
[3:11:04.240 --> 3:11:10.080]  entered it in england off the back of these predictions again made by the very same people
[3:11:10.080 --> 3:11:16.720]  that created these phony ipcc global warming hysterical models that said the antarctic would
[3:11:16.720 --> 3:11:23.120]  be ice free 10 years ago oh yeah we really need to trust those people again that said the uk would
[3:11:23.120 --> 3:11:29.440]  be like the Siberian desert this is what they said back in the 60s paul ehrlich the population
[3:11:29.440 --> 3:11:35.680]  bomb said that there would be global famines because of man-made climate change didn't happen
[3:11:35.680 --> 3:11:41.840]  didn't happen but now we're listening to those same people once again and what they do is they
[3:11:41.840 --> 3:11:46.480]  given government press conference and they come out with these models which were all proven
[3:11:46.480 --> 3:11:52.640]  spectacularly wrong back six months ago before the first lockdown and they say look if we don't
[3:11:52.640 --> 3:11:58.480]  lock down again we're going to have 4 000 deaths per day the nhs is going to be overwhelmed there's
[3:11:58.480 --> 3:12:04.880]  going to be people dying in the corridors of hospitals we need to do this again they over
[3:12:04.880 --> 3:12:10.800]  exaggerate the numbers so then when the actual numbers are way below that we come out of the
[3:12:10.800 --> 3:12:18.560]  lockdown and they say look oh well we were right lockdowns work 4 000 people a day didn't die we
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:24.240]  must have been right all along no you were wrong because you grossly over exaggerated the numbers
[3:12:24.240 --> 3:12:31.360]  in the first place to the point where as we saw with the first lockdown the cases and deaths were
[3:12:31.360 --> 3:12:38.560]  already declining before the lockdown took effect because lockdowns have no impact and then when you
[3:12:38.560 --> 3:12:45.680]  look at the mask wearing for example spain italy france when they introduced the mask mandates
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:51.440]  for example in spain you have to wear a mask everywhere inside or outside the case has shot
[3:12:51.440 --> 3:12:58.160]  up again we've had numerous experts question the efficacy of masks of course they're all ignored
[3:12:58.160 --> 3:13:05.040]  the band they're censored their own graphs show that when they enforced mask mandates the infection
[3:13:05.040 --> 3:13:10.160]  rates the deaths shot up once again so even by their own numbers that doesn't work but now
[3:13:10.160 --> 3:13:16.640]  biden's talking about a nationwide mask mandate and he's talking about lockdown 2.0 but what I
[3:13:16.640 --> 3:13:24.640]  want to get on to before that is how this plays out in the real world and this is a video that
[3:13:24.640 --> 3:13:31.680]  went under the radar last week because of the election headline spirit airlines flight attendant
[3:13:31.680 --> 3:13:37.520]  threatens to have people who don't wear a mask arrested put on no fly list there's no law in
[3:13:37.520 --> 3:13:42.560]  existence that says if you don't wear a mask or if you refuse to pull it up over your face a couple
[3:13:42.560 --> 3:13:48.080]  of times on an airplane that you can be put on a no fly list for life like a frigging terrorist
[3:13:48.080 --> 3:13:55.120]  but we have these petty draconian jumped up enforcers telling a plane full of passengers
[3:13:55.120 --> 3:14:00.480]  that that's the law when it isn't and this one was caught on video there's probably numerous
[3:14:00.480 --> 3:14:06.080]  more examples of it but here is the video clip spirit airlines flight attendant threatens to
[3:14:06.080 --> 3:14:12.720]  have people who don't wear masks arrested put on no fly list let's roll the clip everybody can
[3:14:12.720 --> 3:14:19.920]  effectively take these preventative measures once the door is closed if we have to ask you more than
[3:14:19.920 --> 3:14:26.400]  once to cover your nose mouth put your mask on we are not going to be ruled we are not going to be
[3:14:26.400 --> 3:14:32.640]  nasty we are going to simply take your seat number and your name and when we get where we're going
[3:14:32.640 --> 3:14:37.760]  you will either be arrested fine but you will also be placed on the no fly list meaning you will
[3:14:37.760 --> 3:14:46.880]  not be able to fly any air high for the rest of your life so please again i'm saying this because
[3:14:46.880 --> 3:14:52.000]  there is usually always that one person and i really don't want to have to do the extra paperwork
[3:14:52.640 --> 3:14:59.360]  and do more than i'm intended for my job so if you do not agree or want to you know
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:06.720]  do what needs to be done you are more than welcome to exit at this time we have about
[3:15:06.720 --> 3:15:13.520]  nine more minutes left but i want to give everybody a fair opportunity that you know what is happening
[3:15:14.480 --> 3:15:20.400]  also i'm not really sure what's going on with all these videos going viral of passengers attacking
[3:15:20.400 --> 3:15:29.280]  each other and or flight attendants let me remind you we are government officials this is government
[3:15:29.280 --> 3:15:35.200]  property if you choose to act out a content or character on this airplane you'll be arrested
[3:15:35.200 --> 3:15:43.200]  and face 20 years imprisonment and you also receive a $250,000 fine if a weapon is used you will face
[3:15:43.200 --> 3:15:49.520]  life imprisonment so before anybody gets creative want to feel froggy want to be bad want to be a
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:56.880]  superhero let me let you know what's going on with that being said if you didn't like what i had to
[3:15:56.880 --> 3:16:01.280]  say my name is mario that's what you are so don't forget to dot the i i'm believe flight attendant
[3:16:01.280 --> 3:16:05.200]  on today's flight and i'm a company with a fort lauderdale and dallas based cabin crew who are here
[3:16:05.200 --> 3:16:09.840]  for your safety first and your comfort second if there is anything that you need on your flight
[3:16:09.840 --> 3:16:15.920]  today to make it more enjoyable please don't hesitate to let us know welcome aboard so again
[3:16:15.920 --> 3:16:21.680]  that is a spirit airlines employee claiming that he's a government official no he isn't claiming
[3:16:21.680 --> 3:16:26.560]  that he's on government property no spirit airlines is a commercial airliner claiming that
[3:16:26.560 --> 3:16:32.480]  there's a law that says if you don't pull up your mask when ordered to by the mask police you're
[3:16:32.480 --> 3:16:38.640]  going to get arrested jailed for 20 years and put on a no-fly list like a terrorist and never be
[3:16:38.640 --> 3:16:45.280]  allowed to fly again complete bs they're making it up on the spot i don't know if this guy was
[3:16:45.280 --> 3:16:50.880]  fired he should have been fired but again this got buried during the election this is the social
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:55.520]  credit score and this is how it's going to be integrated with the covid enforcement because
[3:16:55.520 --> 3:17:02.080]  again how is that dissimilar to what's already happening in china where if you post something
[3:17:02.080 --> 3:17:07.120]  online which is critical of the government you don't get to buy a train ticket you don't get to
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:13.760]  ride a bus you don't get to fly and the communist chinese party is open about that they brag about
[3:17:13.760 --> 3:17:20.400]  it through official media and release tallies of how many tens of thousands are indeed i think it was
[3:17:20.400 --> 3:17:26.800]  hundreds of thousands of citizens who've been banned from being able to have basic mobility freedom
[3:17:26.800 --> 3:17:31.840]  of movement because they misbehave they said something bad about the government this is all
[3:17:31.840 --> 3:17:38.880]  being integrated under the great reset we must resist it we'll be right back throughout history
[3:17:38.880 --> 3:17:43.920]  there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two one is born of
[3:17:43.920 --> 3:17:49.040]  renaissance the other is born of conquest one bases its power on having a strong enlightened
[3:17:49.040 --> 3:17:55.760]  focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity art and skill and strength the other
[3:17:55.760 --> 3:18:02.720]  is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it america is
[3:18:02.720 --> 3:18:08.560]  transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass
[3:18:08.560 --> 3:18:13.520]  high tech slavery that's why the globalists tell us america was founded on slavery when it wasn't
[3:18:13.520 --> 3:18:18.320]  they point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters
[3:18:18.320 --> 3:18:23.440]  a global permanent lockdown is here it's already causing millions and millions of starved death
[3:18:23.440 --> 3:18:27.600]  when they're done billions of starved death even the former head of the ministry of defense
[3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:32.080]  in england and a top general have come out and said the covered lockdown is going to trigger
[3:18:32.080 --> 3:18:38.240]  a giant new world war that's the facts this is the bill gates new world order weapon there are many
[3:18:38.240 --> 3:18:44.480]  references in the holy bible to the mustard seed and why is that it's one of the tiniest seeds out
[3:18:44.480 --> 3:18:51.760]  there but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds mustard was known

[3:20:42.400 --> 3:20:58.480]  live from london england it's haul joseph watson with summit dot news
[3:21:01.760 --> 3:21:08.080]  so we see people being terrified into uh complying with mask mandates coronavirus rules by the
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:12.560]  mainstream media of course that's what produces polls like the one i talked about earlier in the
[3:21:12.560 --> 3:21:19.200]  show where americans literally believe corona virus has killed 200 times more people than it
[3:21:19.200 --> 3:21:26.000]  actually has that can only be because of mainstream media propaganda then you get it in the real world
[3:21:26.000 --> 3:21:33.440]  with petty covid enforcers threatening people with no fly list 20 years in jail that's not a law
[3:21:33.440 --> 3:21:38.960]  doesn't exist but they're just threatening it anyway people who bought airliners and then
[3:21:38.960 --> 3:21:43.520]  you get it in entertainment as well because as we know a lot of people still watch the mainstream
[3:21:43.520 --> 3:21:50.240]  media but not all people watch news of any kind whatsoever but they do watch their shows they
[3:21:50.240 --> 3:21:56.400]  watch their favorite shows on netflix on cable television can they escape the propaganda no
[3:21:56.400 --> 3:22:02.800]  no they can't no it's even more vociferous there and now the networks are catching up because of
[3:22:02.800 --> 3:22:08.960]  course most of these shows were probably made you know six to eight months ago when the covid
[3:22:08.960 --> 3:22:14.880]  pandemic when the lockdown was just beginning so now we're beginning to see the propaganda
[3:22:14.880 --> 3:22:24.320]  inserted into fictional entertainment shows like ncis new orleans headline ncis new orleans
[3:22:24.320 --> 3:22:30.080]  pushes mask propaganda we've got two clips which we're going to roll right now and let's roll them
[3:22:30.080 --> 3:22:38.080]  back to back the new season of ncis new orleans is replete with pro mask messaging featuring
[3:22:38.080 --> 3:22:43.840]  innumerable scenes where characters are told to wear masks in situations where it's not even compulsory
[3:22:44.560 --> 3:22:48.720]  and in fact we're going to roll the clips right now and then i'll come back and talk about it
[3:22:48.720 --> 3:23:04.640]  here are the clips
[3:23:19.680 --> 3:23:34.640]  sir you're okay sir
[3:23:42.960 --> 3:23:44.640]  9-1-1 what's your virginity
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:54.560]  uh
[3:23:59.200 --> 3:24:04.640]  i'm looking for anything you can spare body bags cleaning supplies personnel
[3:24:04.640 --> 3:24:12.560]  no i know you're busy there too look i'll take anything you got except bodies
[3:24:16.160 --> 3:24:20.320]  i have no space roger we're not supposed to do well first pull up your mask
[3:24:22.320 --> 3:24:27.600]  oh what happened to the fresh ones i gave you this is a fresh one or was handed the rest out to the
[3:24:27.600 --> 3:24:33.040]  crew i'll get some more no need doc this is my last drop off that i'm home for the night unless
[3:24:33.040 --> 3:24:42.000]  of course i have to find a home for him they're ready for us uh all right really man i have to
[3:24:42.000 --> 3:24:47.440]  take care of some business first and then i'll find a home for him appreciate it doc hope you
[3:24:47.440 --> 3:24:59.840]  get a break soon too so for the benefit of people who are just listening and what not watching those
[3:24:59.840 --> 3:25:04.400]  videos in the first clip the character which i believe is the main character in the show
[3:25:05.120 --> 3:25:12.080]  leaves a bar and is faced with a completely deserted street he later sees a wolf on the street
[3:25:12.080 --> 3:25:17.040]  promulgating the environmentalist notion that humanity has retreated and nature is taking over
[3:25:17.040 --> 3:25:22.560]  again this is this whole gaia principle which we saw back at the beginning of the pandemic where
[3:25:22.560 --> 3:25:28.160]  a lot of people on the left like oh nature's taking over again i can hear the birds sing
[3:25:28.160 --> 3:25:34.800]  i mean we may be reduced to a level of economic dependence on the technocratic elite that makes
[3:25:34.800 --> 3:25:41.840]  us literal peasants but oh my god i saw a wolf so again it's this whole gaia environmentalist
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:49.360]  utopian notion that humanity is retreating indoors inside its house arrest prison and the
[3:25:49.360 --> 3:25:58.320]  vaunted gaia supreme spiritual uh environmentalist utopia is reasserting control so then he sees a
[3:25:58.320 --> 3:26:04.560]  guy crash a car and the guy's coughing and spluttering so he immediately puts on his mask again
[3:26:04.560 --> 3:26:10.640]  that's based on the videos that came out of china before the pandemic reached the west
[3:26:10.640 --> 3:26:16.080]  which i tweeted we all featured we all believed them at the time and if you remember they literally
[3:26:16.080 --> 3:26:23.040]  show people coughing and collapsing on the street apparently because they were covid victims now we
[3:26:23.040 --> 3:26:29.600]  know that was complete bs even people who are severely infected with covid aren't walking around
[3:26:30.240 --> 3:26:37.920]  convulsing and collapsing on the streets that was military grade chinese propaganda to provoke the
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:43.120]  western world into having these draconian lockdowns and now look what's happening in china oh their
[3:26:43.120 --> 3:26:51.040]  economy is completely recovered back to pre-covid levels and in some cases even better they're having
[3:26:51.040 --> 3:26:57.680]  pool parties with thousands of people in close proximity in wuhan the communist chinese party
[3:26:57.680 --> 3:27:03.600]  is celebrating how chinese people are all back in nightclubs guess what none of them are wearing
[3:27:03.600 --> 3:27:11.680]  masks but now because there's a delay on when this new season of ncis new orleans was made which
[3:27:11.680 --> 3:27:20.240]  was probably back i would imagine in february march april of this year they're replicating the chinese
[3:27:20.240 --> 3:27:26.640]  propaganda that we saw back in january that people were just convulsing vomiting collapsing on the
[3:27:26.640 --> 3:27:33.600]  streets now we know it was complete bs designed to steamroll and scare monger the west into these
[3:27:33.600 --> 3:27:39.760]  draconian lockdowns which were then gleefully seized upon by the technocratic elite for their
[3:27:39.760 --> 3:27:47.440]  great reset and then in the other clip an emt worker is lectured by a female doctor who tells him
[3:27:47.440 --> 3:27:54.800]  pull up your mask and this entire show from what people have watched it have said basically is
[3:27:54.800 --> 3:28:02.560]  based around the premise that covet nineteen is a new plague because again this was made back six
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:08.080]  eight months ago when the world health organization was lying and claiming that covet nineteen had
[3:28:08.080 --> 3:28:14.320]  a six to eight percent fatality rate remember that they literally said six percent of people who got
[3:28:14.320 --> 3:28:21.360]  it would die turned out to be what was it 0.05 percent again if you're healthy it's literally
[3:28:21.360 --> 3:28:28.720]  99.98 percent chance of survival so somebody who watched this episode i think it was the first
[3:28:28.720 --> 3:28:34.560]  episode of the new season wrote into lockdown skeptics and he said quote within the first
[3:28:34.560 --> 3:28:39.120]  two minutes the lead character had masked up in the street despite there being no one else around
[3:28:39.680 --> 3:28:46.800]  within five minutes he was quoting borris's that's borris johnson uk prime minister hands face space so
[3:28:46.800 --> 3:28:54.960]  he's literally quoting government advice propaganda and this in an american show he continues to say
[3:28:54.960 --> 3:29:00.640]  numerous times mask wearing was portrayed as if it was compulsory with nearly every character
[3:29:00.640 --> 3:29:05.840]  wearing one is this what we're up against now television shows being used to promote how dangerous
[3:29:05.840 --> 3:29:12.000]  the virus is without any question no mention of how unproven any of the science or data behind
[3:29:12.000 --> 3:29:18.960]  mask wearing is and then he went on to say that the message behind the show was that covet nineteen
[3:29:18.960 --> 3:29:25.040]  is the new plague that has descended upon humanity which is why you saw the utopian
[3:29:25.040 --> 3:29:31.040]  all guys taking over nature's taking over so if they're not getting it through the mainstream media
[3:29:31.680 --> 3:29:37.600]  if they're not getting it through these polls which literally say in britain the average person
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:44.160]  thinks five million people have died from covid when the actual number is below 50 000 of course
[3:29:44.160 --> 3:29:49.920]  many of them elderly with comorbidities two or three comorbidities who would have probably died
[3:29:49.920 --> 3:29:56.000]  within three weeks of that time space anyway if they're not getting it through the enforcement
[3:29:56.000 --> 3:30:01.600]  by these carons who are on the street saying wear your mask pull up your mask who are on spirit
[3:30:01.600 --> 3:30:05.680]  airline saying you're going to be locked up for 20 years you're going to be put on a no-fly list
[3:30:05.680 --> 3:30:10.480]  like a terrorist if you don't do what we say immediately they're not getting it through the
[3:30:10.480 --> 3:30:16.000]  media the news media they're not getting it through the real world of these petty enforcers
[3:30:16.000 --> 3:30:22.560]  now with biden's new lockdown 2.0 apparently on its way then they're getting it through propaganda
[3:30:22.560 --> 3:30:28.000]  like ncis new Orleans and you're going to see a lot more of that over the coming weeks and months
[3:30:28.000 --> 3:30:34.240]  because all these shows are catching up with this hysteria don't go away summit dot news we'll be right

[3:31:43.600 --> 3:31:48.560]  than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the club of rome and the cfr and others were
[3:31:48.560 --> 3:31:54.320]  actually saying develop the hypothesis that the communist china had been set up to take our jobs
[3:31:54.320 --> 3:31:59.200]  and transfer them to china and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt
[3:31:59.200 --> 3:32:04.640]  well now china owns the debt now china owns hollywood all the one side of trading deals it turns out
[3:32:04.640 --> 3:32:10.160]  our analysis was absolutely dead on but again it wasn't that hard the cfr and others admitted what
[3:32:10.160 --> 3:32:16.400]  they were doing but still others didn't want to focus on that issue we did and you focused on it

[3:33:46.720 --> 3:33:52.000]  we have history on our side if we take action and if we spread the truth i have been warning
[3:33:52.000 --> 3:33:57.360]  everyone of exactly what was going to come in the exact order how did i do that because the
[3:33:57.360 --> 3:34:03.200]  globalist war game at all in public and prepare the public with brainwashing on msn when they put
[3:34:03.200 --> 3:34:08.640]  out the 80 million balance we knew it was so they could stuff it after the polls closed that's why
[3:34:08.640 --> 3:34:14.560]  they got federal courts to rule to keep it open for weeks of need being again it was so simple
[3:34:14.560 --> 3:34:19.360]  and of course you see the media heat up saying trump did a bad job on covet and that once
[3:34:19.360 --> 3:34:25.120]  biden was quote president elect he would order trump to admit that he did a bad job and admit
[3:34:25.120 --> 3:34:29.680]  that he needs a second lockdown and if he doesn't go under biden's immediate control and put that
[3:34:29.680 --> 3:34:33.600]  locked out in place he'll try to remove the president with a 25th amendment and all of that
[3:34:33.600 --> 3:34:43.360]  is a trick trump to take the blame for covet the chinese you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:34:51.040 --> 3:34:55.360]  you're listening to summit dot news with paul joseph watson
[3:34:55.360 --> 3:35:04.320]  now of course we have an interesting situation with the whole coveting
[3:35:06.320 --> 3:35:10.880]  new president remains to be seen who that is the mainstream media would love to
[3:35:10.880 --> 3:35:15.920]  anoint themselves with the power of deciding that they don't have that power the recounts
[3:35:15.920 --> 3:35:20.560]  are happening the litigation is happening and they're starting to get nervous from what i've
[3:35:20.560 --> 3:35:26.240]  seen but there's an interesting dichotomy because of course you could have a scenario where now we
[3:35:26.240 --> 3:35:31.360]  know that this vaccine and i'm going to get on to the story in a minute was deliberately delayed
[3:35:31.360 --> 3:35:35.520]  the announcement that we have this new successful covet vaccine that prevents 90 percent of
[3:35:35.520 --> 3:35:41.760]  infections was deliberately delayed until after the election or at least november 3rd so trump
[3:35:41.760 --> 3:35:49.200]  couldn't take credit for it we have the proposal the scenario whereby coronavirus could disappear
[3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:55.120]  from the headlines almost disappear at least become a background story the day after joe
[3:35:55.120 --> 3:36:00.080]  biden is inaugurated and then he could take credit for the vaccine he could take credit
[3:36:00.640 --> 3:36:06.480]  for the diminishing cases if they take that narrative what could also happen is that they
[3:36:06.480 --> 3:36:12.000]  continue to pursue this great reset which is the most likely scenario and that we have as we've had
[3:36:12.000 --> 3:36:19.120]  in england lockdown 2.0 and that looks like the most likely scenario from my perspective
[3:36:19.120 --> 3:36:26.960]  headline here out of rt get ready biden covet 19 advisor pitches national lockdown
[3:36:26.960 --> 3:36:32.400]  warns us will be hitting 200 000 cases a day looks like they're going to have the national
[3:36:32.400 --> 3:36:38.720]  mask mandate and lockdown 2.0 we've got a video of this we'll play it here in a second this is
[3:36:38.720 --> 3:36:45.440]  epidemiologist dr michael osterholm who has joined joe biden's covet 19 advisory board
[3:36:45.440 --> 3:36:50.720]  because of course he's pretending that he's already the president and he's warned americans to get ready
[3:36:50.720 --> 3:36:57.040]  as he expects cases to continue to surge and once a national lockdown to combat the pandemic
[3:36:57.040 --> 3:37:07.760]  let's roll the clip can you see a scenario around the corner perhaps in this winter where there is
[3:37:07.760 --> 3:37:12.720]  some form of a national lockdown maybe like one that we're seeing in europe where the schools stay
[3:37:12.720 --> 3:37:19.360]  open yeah or some form of a lockdown if this gets bad enough well first of all if you interview
[3:37:19.360 --> 3:37:24.320]  50 people you can get 75 different definitions what a lockdown is okay so let's just be clear
[3:37:24.320 --> 3:37:28.800]  i don't think anybody knows what they're talking about when they talk about a lockdown myself included
[3:37:28.800 --> 3:37:33.040]  in the first week of august neil cash carry the president of the minneapolis federal reserve bank
[3:37:33.040 --> 3:37:39.120]  and i wrote an op-ed piece in your times that basically said we need to in a sense lockdown
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:46.000]  to drive this infection level to a place where we can actually control it with testing and tracing
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:50.240]  and follow-up that way just like the asian countries have done and and i'm talking about
[3:37:50.240 --> 3:37:55.280]  everything from australia to new zealand all the way right up through china japan all of those
[3:37:55.280 --> 3:38:00.400]  countries have done it already and what it would take however though is to really to deal with the
[3:38:00.400 --> 3:38:06.000]  pain and suffering economically is what we basically proposed was because the savings rate in this
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:11.920]  country has gone out of the roof since the pandemic we've gone from 8 percent over 22 percent we could
[3:38:11.920 --> 3:38:17.520]  borrow the money from ourselves at a historically low interest rates we could pay people to lose
[3:38:17.520 --> 3:38:23.680]  lose their jobs we can pay small businesses we can take care of city state and county governments
[3:38:23.680 --> 3:38:27.920]  if we just elected to do that if washington could get together and make that happen that would be
[3:38:27.920 --> 3:38:33.040]  a very different kind of lockdown where people wouldn't suffer and we could get this virus under
[3:38:33.040 --> 3:38:38.720]  control anybody and and the media did this after the election when they had polling data on did you
[3:38:38.720 --> 3:38:44.000]  vote for the corona virus did you vote for the economy they're not different if we're a raging
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:49.200]  house on fire with corona virus in this country our economy is not going to do well so we've
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:54.560]  got to understand we have a way to do it we just have elected not to do it yet the basic what i
[3:38:54.560 --> 3:39:03.600]  call pay to prevail so again you notice there that he's proposing expanding the national debt rapidly
[3:39:03.600 --> 3:39:08.800]  basically paying people not to work which is the equivalent of a universal basic income
[3:39:08.800 --> 3:39:15.600]  directly in line with the globalist great reset agenda where they redistribute the wealth when in
[3:39:15.600 --> 3:39:22.160]  fact they're concentrating the wealth and power within their own grubby hands they're openly
[3:39:22.160 --> 3:39:29.120]  talking about abolishing private property and basically having people sit on twitter all day
[3:39:29.120 --> 3:39:34.640]  while automaton robots do their jobs they have their slave workers working in the restaurants
[3:39:34.640 --> 3:39:40.800]  providing their meals nobody is able to have personal autonomy nobody is able to have personal
[3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:48.160]  mobility rights but they sit up in their ivory towers enjoying what they see as the finite
[3:39:48.160 --> 3:39:54.160]  resources that are left on the planet with this giant slave class serving them on minimum wage
[3:39:54.160 --> 3:40:00.480]  on universal basic income below because it's too dangerous for them to work it's too dangerous
[3:40:00.480 --> 3:40:05.520]  for them to go outside because covid is still such a giant threat now they're saying the
[3:40:05.520 --> 3:40:10.880]  vaccine is probably not going to come out until next winter so we're going to need more lockdowns
[3:40:10.880 --> 3:40:17.200]  until then just to tide us over again never achieving herd immunity like sweden has done
[3:40:17.200 --> 3:40:22.640]  like belarus has done and their economies have already recovered then you have the vaccine itself
[3:40:22.640 --> 3:40:30.160]  because of course what an amazing coincidence that days after the election that mere days
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:35.520]  after the mainstream media two days after the mainstream media anointed joe biden as the next
[3:40:35.520 --> 3:40:42.800]  president suddenly we had a successful covid vaccine what an astounding coincidence was that
[3:40:42.800 --> 3:40:49.840]  delayed well we now have a top biotech expert who says covid vaccine announcement was deliberately
[3:40:49.840 --> 3:40:56.960]  delayed until after the election this is a guy called barry norris of argonaut capital partners
[3:40:57.760 --> 3:41:02.720]  who again is an expert on the biotech sector he said the announcement could have been made sooner
[3:41:02.720 --> 3:41:08.960]  and was likely delayed so that trump couldn't take full credit he said quote there are 44,000
[3:41:08.960 --> 3:41:15.760]  people in the trial with half in the placebo they were supposed to read out after just 32 cases in
[3:41:15.760 --> 3:41:20.560]  total it was thought the trial hadn't yet read out because they hadn't yet had enough infections
[3:41:21.280 --> 3:41:28.560]  the trial actually read out after 94 cases these are his words so they delayed it on purpose
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:34.800]  apparently as a result of discussions with the fda he says this smells like they didn't
[3:41:34.800 --> 3:41:41.840]  want to announce it pre-presidential election in case the good news helped the incumbent trump
[3:41:41.840 --> 3:41:46.640]  must be fuming so if trump was able to seize upon this vaccine announcement
[3:41:47.600 --> 3:41:53.600]  that could have pushed him over in the polls in spite of all this cheating and magical fairy dust
[3:41:53.600 --> 3:41:59.040]  for air ballots that arrived in favor of joe biden because of course when they did the exit polls
[3:41:59.040 --> 3:42:05.360]  they found that of course the economy was the number one issue for voters but covet 19 was
[3:42:05.360 --> 3:42:10.320]  number two so there's no doubt that if this had been announced a week beforehand which according
[3:42:10.320 --> 3:42:15.920]  to this expert they already had the data to do that trump would have seized upon that rightly
[3:42:15.920 --> 3:42:22.240]  and it would have helped him in the polls but they deliberately delayed it because it might have
[3:42:22.240 --> 3:42:29.520]  dropped it might have pushed trump over the edge again political engineering in regard to this
[3:42:29.520 --> 3:42:34.800]  vaccine if it's so successful if it's so great why wouldn't you want to get the news out there
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:40.800]  why wouldn't you want to fast track the approval as soon as possible they apparently delayed it to
[3:42:40.800 --> 3:42:48.800]  help joe biden another thing that's helping joe biden is this mysterious process whereby
[3:42:48.800 --> 3:42:55.440]  dead people voted for him whereby they stopped counting the vote from midnight to one a.m when
[3:42:55.440 --> 3:43:01.040]  donald trump was clearly set to win again i was watching it live you had the new york times
[3:43:01.840 --> 3:43:07.840]  with their needles which show the probability of a candidate winning going for trump initially in
[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:13.840]  florida 99 percent he was negative they initially favored biden of course most of the pollsters
[3:43:13.840 --> 3:43:19.520]  claimed that biden would win florida florida went early for trump then you had georgia
[3:43:19.520 --> 3:43:25.520]  north carolina these needles again going severely in trump's favor i'm thinking in the case of georgia
[3:43:25.520 --> 3:43:33.600]  it was up to 85 percent likelihood that trump would win georgia and then suddenly at midnight at one
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:40.080]  a.m they just stopped counting the trump votes and just magically received hundreds of thousands
[3:43:40.080 --> 3:43:46.240]  of biden votes in these mysterious palates that were snuck into backdoors after the deadline when
[3:43:46.240 --> 3:43:53.040]  they were supposed to stop counting and then we have stories like this woman who voted for
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:44:00.000]  trump in texas shocked to find record of her voting via mail in ballot in california a woman
[3:44:00.000 --> 3:44:05.040]  who says she voted in person for president trump in texas was shocked to discover that voter records
[3:44:05.040 --> 3:44:10.640]  showed she'd also apparently voted in orange county california via mail in barrett ballot so this is
[3:44:10.640 --> 3:44:17.680]  a woman who moved to texas a year ago from california she voted in person for president
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:24.720]  donald trump she says she's never voted for anyone by mail and yet she went on the official
[3:44:24.720 --> 3:44:31.600]  voter status dot gov website and it says she's registered as a permanent vote by mail voter
[3:44:31.600 --> 3:44:38.160]  with a party preference of democrat and that she'd been mailed a ballot on the fifth of october
[3:44:38.160 --> 3:44:44.880]  then that this had been received and accepted in california on the third of november on the same
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:53.280]  day she voted in person in texas for president donald trump oh by the way she checked from
[3:44:53.280 --> 3:45:00.000]  2016 because she told us directly not only had she never voted by mail in ballot but she didn't
[3:45:00.000 --> 3:45:07.600]  vote for any candidate in 2016 lo and behold she goes on the website and it shows she voted by mail
[3:45:07.600 --> 3:45:16.000]  in ballot in 2016 in orange county california despite the fact that that didn't happen this has
[3:45:16.000 --> 3:45:22.160]  got a long way to go the media has fact-checked donald trump for four plus years now it's time
[3:45:22.160 --> 3:45:30.800]  to fact check the vote summit.news
