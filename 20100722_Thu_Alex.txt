[00:00.000 --> 00:12.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:12.440 --> 00:20.000]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:20.000 --> 00:25.600]  Texas Alex Jones well he's the former head of the Green Party in England
[00:25.600 --> 00:31.000]  championship goalie international BBC presenter multi-time best-selling author
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.440]  and somebody who's really expanded people's paradigms and got them to look
[00:35.440 --> 00:39.600]  into a lot of very interesting places and so much of what David Ike predicted
[00:39.600 --> 00:44.440]  more than 15 years ago unfortunately has unfolded I agree with him that we're on
[00:44.440 --> 00:48.800]  the verge of a world transformation an awakening the system is panicking with
[00:48.800 --> 00:52.560]  divide and conquer there's no doubt they blew the oil well there's no doubt
[00:52.560 --> 00:55.120]  they're now admitting we're going into a depression trying to start World War
[00:55.120 --> 01:00.600]  3 they know they're losing control and let me tell you this is the most important
[01:00.600 --> 01:04.280]  time in human history up to this point he's with us for the next hour David
[01:04.280 --> 01:08.920]  Ike thank you for being on with us well we were just talking during that one
[01:08.920 --> 01:13.240]  minute break and and you were saying that you do believe this is the quickening
[01:13.240 --> 01:17.120]  or the beginning of the acceleration of a real paradigm shift there's a lot of
[01:17.120 --> 01:20.880]  issues I want to go over but what's on David Ike's radar screen that you think
[01:20.880 --> 01:25.440]  is most important right now well I think you know what we're seeing on the
[01:25.440 --> 01:30.520]  surface horrendous as it is is a manifestation of something that's
[01:30.520 --> 01:35.520]  actually much much deeper than this there's no doubt whatsoever I mean I've
[01:35.520 --> 01:39.640]  seen it so blatantly over the last 20 years gathering pace and gathering pace
[01:39.640 --> 01:44.640]  there is an awakening going on it's not the majority yet but minds are opening
[01:44.640 --> 01:49.600]  now as minds are opening they're seeing what they couldn't see before and what
[01:49.600 --> 01:54.680]  the cabal wants to do is keep those minds shut and one of the most effective
[01:54.680 --> 01:58.880]  ways of doing this is why we've got to stay really strong and focused in this
[01:58.880 --> 02:02.400]  period we're going through now it's going to be a number of years of major
[02:02.400 --> 02:10.000]  challenges the way that they are seeking to keep us from awakening to keep our
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.760]  minds closed is to keep us focused on fear keep us focused on survival keep us
[02:15.760 --> 02:20.720]  bewildered keep us in a state of constant anxiety about what's happening what
[02:20.720 --> 02:25.040]  about the future what about the kids what about the job their way of life in the
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.000]  gulf has gone oh my goodness a war in Iraq in Iran now what's going on now
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.080]  now there's an economic depression oh my this is orchestrated to throw
[02:36.080 --> 02:41.440]  everything not just the kitchen sink but the plug as well at humanity in
[02:41.440 --> 02:48.120]  general so that we are so focused on on survival and fear and anxiety that we
[02:48.120 --> 02:54.160]  don't go and continue this process of awakening so we can actually expand our
[02:54.160 --> 02:59.040]  minds to see what the closed minds before could not see it's a battle for
[02:59.040 --> 03:05.520]  our minds it may not seem like that it may seem like it's it's just another
[03:05.520 --> 03:11.920]  manufactured catastrophe in the Gulf another war in Iran another economic
[03:11.920 --> 03:17.200]  collapse but all these things are orchestrated to to to fire at our minds
[03:17.200 --> 03:24.440]  and and our minds are the target because from our state of perception of self in
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.840]  the world comes our behavior and our actions that's right I've noticed the
[03:28.840 --> 03:34.400]  globalist dominate by just getting our attention and always creating new crisis
[03:34.400 --> 03:38.120]  so we watch the mainstream television so we pay attention to them and they
[03:38.120 --> 03:44.040]  dominate how we dress and what we think and what we eat and and and just
[03:44.040 --> 03:50.240]  literally get us sucked into this false tapestry this false reality that they
[03:50.240 --> 03:53.800]  are projecting and now they're openly saying they want to start shutting off
[03:53.800 --> 03:57.480]  the web which shows that they realize they wanted to use it as a tool of
[03:57.480 --> 04:01.600]  domination but that it's backfiring against them that's the word Alex
[04:01.600 --> 04:09.480]  attention it's a battle for our attention because the the the idea is to hold
[04:09.480 --> 04:16.400]  humanity in a state where we are filtering and seeing ourselves in the
[04:16.400 --> 04:22.720]  world only through the five senses we are multi-dimensional consciousness
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.400]  awareness we are far far greater but what we appear to be when we look in the
[04:27.400 --> 04:31.840]  mirror and say that's David Eich or that's Alex Jones or that's Ethel Smith
[04:31.840 --> 04:38.640]  and what they want us to do is keep our attention on the five senses and
[04:38.640 --> 04:43.320]  that's what we do when we are in fear when we are in anxiety when we're
[04:43.320 --> 04:49.080]  worrying about the future when we have this sense of fear of not surviving that
[04:49.080 --> 04:53.280]  pulls us into the five senses and that's what they're trying to do and the system
[04:53.280 --> 04:57.160]  poses as the saviors and says we'll keep you safe just let us run your life
[04:57.160 --> 05:03.200]  stay there David Eich back in three minutes a lot of kids from his central
[05:03.200 --> 05:08.320]  Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[05:08.320 --> 05:14.200]  it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network well we've got David Eich with us
[05:14.200 --> 05:18.040]  for the rest of the hour if you just joined us former head of the UK Green
[05:18.040 --> 05:24.000]  Party champion goalie a BBC presenter best-selling author and always
[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000]  interesting to get his perspective on things I always find it thought-provoking
[05:27.000 --> 05:34.360]  and very apropos what's happening in our world we always find his perspective
[05:34.360 --> 05:40.120]  to be enlightening David instead of us getting into you know generalities or
[05:40.120 --> 05:44.080]  you know myself getting into you know long died tribes about my view of what's
[05:44.080 --> 05:47.760]  happening today I really want to try to sit back we'll see if I can do it because
[05:47.760 --> 05:50.640]  you bring up so many points that make me want to chime in and just throw out
[05:50.640 --> 05:57.480]  questions and get your take on it the globalist are overrunning the West with
[05:57.480 --> 06:06.400]  third-world populations why are they doing this well it's two things we need
[06:06.400 --> 06:10.520]  to know to get a perspective on the world is where this cabal wants to take
[06:10.520 --> 06:15.200]  the world and the then the methods they use to take us there and where they
[06:15.200 --> 06:21.320]  want to take the world of course as we well know is to a global fascist
[06:21.320 --> 06:26.880]  dictatorship with the end of countries the end of borders where basically you
[06:26.880 --> 06:30.520]  just have the world government dictating to massive regional blocks and
[06:30.520 --> 06:37.680]  anything below that is just irrelevant and one of the great barriers to that
[06:37.680 --> 06:44.840]  happening is the people's sense of their own culture their own country their
[06:44.840 --> 06:51.280]  own sovereign nation if you like and because people if they have a real sense
[06:51.280 --> 06:55.520]  of country and that you know I'm not saying that I'm into all this but a lot
[06:55.520 --> 07:00.640]  of people are and this is the point from the cabal's point of view they will
[07:00.640 --> 07:06.280]  resist giving that power away say from the United States to the North American
[07:06.280 --> 07:13.040]  Union in Britain to the European Union and so the idea is to break down that
[07:13.040 --> 07:18.680]  sense of culture by basically breaking down the culture and you do that by
[07:18.680 --> 07:22.400]  opening borders to other cultures now I'm not saying one culture is better
[07:22.400 --> 07:25.280]  than another I'm just trying to explain here what they're doing from their
[07:25.280 --> 07:31.520]  perspective and that you let different cultures pour into into the same area and
[07:31.520 --> 07:36.760]  suddenly it becomes a cocktail and there is no single culture anymore that people
[07:36.760 --> 07:43.360]  can identify with and that is all the time loosening and weakening people's
[07:43.360 --> 07:49.800]  sense of need to resist the giving away of sovereignty to to unions and to a
[07:49.800 --> 07:53.200]  world government because they've lost the sense of culture that they had
[07:53.200 --> 07:58.000]  before this is why what we're talking about here is happening all over the
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.160]  world because of course it's a global agenda in Europe the European Union has
[08:03.160 --> 08:06.560]  brought down the borders all over Europe and every time another country comes
[08:06.560 --> 08:10.880]  into the European Union their borders come down and they're the borders
[08:10.880 --> 08:15.480]  between them and every other country comes down and so from Eastern Europe
[08:15.480 --> 08:20.400]  for instance people pour into Western European countries and it becomes again
[08:20.400 --> 08:25.120]  exactly the same thing a cocktail of cultures which eventually becomes just
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.840]  nothing that really is something people can identify and the globalists can also
[08:29.840 --> 08:33.800]  play those different groups off against each other not only will they give up
[08:33.800 --> 08:37.440]  their rights but then I see the trend these always counter back oh well it's
[08:37.440 --> 08:41.560]  like Star Trek which we know is predictive programming oh you will all
[08:41.560 --> 08:46.000]  be unified in love but this isn't some loving world government that we decided
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.960]  to lovingly join this was covertly built they now admit it was a covertly
[08:50.960 --> 08:55.880]  built and it's authoritarian dehumanizing and it's admitted in game is
[08:55.880 --> 09:00.960]  global depopulation yeah exactly and this is a very very interesting point a
[09:00.960 --> 09:05.160]  very important point about that they're playing one off against the other you
[09:05.160 --> 09:11.360]  know the people that pour it from from the the poorer countries into the richer
[09:11.360 --> 09:18.680]  countries through through the borders coming down just as much pawns in this
[09:18.680 --> 09:22.880]  game as those in the countries of the indigenous population that are affected
[09:22.880 --> 09:28.200]  by that it's not good guys and bad guys we're talking about here it's it's
[09:28.200 --> 09:33.680]  different aspects of the human race being used as pawns in the same game and
[09:33.680 --> 09:38.040]  this is why instead of fighting each other we need to start looking at what
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.160]  unites us all which is the fact that we're all the target of this this
[09:42.160 --> 09:46.200]  cabal this this global fascist dictatorship in the making of the very
[09:46.200 --> 09:52.640]  fast-making I mean we have proof in this country a few months ago now that
[09:52.640 --> 09:59.720]  during the the Blair administration they were allowing people immigration into
[09:59.720 --> 10:03.640]  Britain on a scale they weren't admitting to it came out one of the
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.720]  people involved blue the whistle on this and what they were actually saying is
[10:09.720 --> 10:15.560]  they wanted to have so much immigration into Britain that it would this is the
[10:15.560 --> 10:22.120]  quote change British society forever and in that one quote we have the prime
[10:22.120 --> 10:26.480]  reason for bringing the borders down this is what they've done in Europe I
[10:26.480 --> 10:30.000]  mean the government here now the new government of Cameron saying oh we must
[10:30.000 --> 10:34.120]  we must slow down immigration into Britain but they don't say immigration
[10:34.120 --> 10:41.920]  they say non EU immigration because they have absolutely no power whatsoever
[10:41.920 --> 10:47.160]  because of the European Union laws now and the giving away of sovereignty to
[10:47.160 --> 10:51.680]  stop anybody coming in from the European Union into Britain and that's
[10:51.680 --> 10:55.000]  exactly the position they want they're doing the same in America of courses
[10:55.000 --> 10:59.600]  listeners to this program will well know and so anyone that the challenges this
[10:59.600 --> 11:03.720]  in America for instance they're called racist and that they're targeted by the
[11:03.720 --> 11:08.360]  federal government as we're seeing in some some states of America try to try
[11:08.360 --> 11:14.000]  to make a stand on this and it's all orchestrated to break down and destroy a
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.400]  sense of what is it what is America of what is Britain what is all these
[11:19.400 --> 11:22.880]  countries that are targeted and like I say this is not an attack on what we
[11:22.880 --> 11:27.760]  call immigrants it's absolutely not because they are as much pawns in this
[11:27.760 --> 11:33.240]  game as anybody and David let me just add a brief caveat to that absolutely I
[11:33.240 --> 11:36.640]  mean it's simple whatever the globalists are for whatever they're really
[11:36.640 --> 11:40.360]  promoting in their councils we've got to be against if they're against disarming
[11:40.360 --> 11:43.400]  us it doesn't mean there aren't some accidents and problems with having an
[11:43.400 --> 11:47.960]  armed society we've still got to be for it if they're trying to socialize
[11:47.960 --> 11:52.400]  healthcare you get the legislation it's a it's a eugenics takeover lowering the
[11:52.400 --> 11:56.400]  quality raising taxes we've got to be against it they want to launch new war
[11:56.400 --> 11:59.760]  we've got to be against it they want open borders we've got to be against it
[11:59.760 --> 12:04.480]  I mean it's very simple we know these are evil anti-human anti-freedom people
[12:04.480 --> 12:09.920]  and we must stand against everything they stand for now we can intellectualize
[12:09.920 --> 12:13.480]  and then always go down the road and look at why that's the case but their
[12:13.480 --> 12:17.840]  interests are not the interest of free humanity so it's very elementary for me
[12:17.840 --> 12:25.000]  you that's a very very good point let's get it real straight these people not
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  only don't care about us they are antagonistic towards us they want to
[12:31.000 --> 12:35.560]  destroy the human race and bring it under the heel of their global fascist
[12:35.560 --> 12:39.640]  dictatorship they want to irrevocably change what humans are in our society
[12:39.640 --> 12:43.960]  the family everything till we are just empty biological androids and their
[12:43.960 --> 12:48.680]  words that they program this is the end of humanity this is the extinction of
[12:48.680 --> 12:53.520]  humanity is their stated goal in every document I've got by their transhumanist
[12:53.520 --> 12:59.640]  futurist these are human hating scum this is what we're dealing with and
[12:59.640 --> 13:03.680]  therefore as you quite rightly say if they're for it then it's bad for the
[13:03.680 --> 13:09.200]  human race and we've got to be a bit more kind of streetwise about this and
[13:09.200 --> 13:14.800]  not see everything in black and white the question of gun ownership I've
[13:14.800 --> 13:20.240]  never had a gun I don't want a gun I don't want to use a gun I'm not into
[13:20.240 --> 13:25.160]  any of that stuff but a lot of people have guns in America the question that
[13:25.160 --> 13:29.200]  comes up is should people have guns or should people not have guns and that's
[13:29.200 --> 13:34.640]  the debate okay but it's not the debate but at heart what's happening now the
[13:34.640 --> 13:41.120]  question should be why do the people who have a deep hatred but for humanity
[13:41.120 --> 13:45.720]  why do they want to disarm the American population now that's the key thing we
[13:45.720 --> 13:50.240]  ought to be looking at we can have these debates about this and immigration the
[13:50.240 --> 13:56.800]  question is why does the cabal want to do it and the answer is always because it
[13:56.800 --> 14:02.360]  advances their agenda towards the global fascist dictatorship in which as you
[14:02.360 --> 14:05.920]  rightly say it won't just be an economic dictatorship a political
[14:05.920 --> 14:10.000]  dictatorship we're talking about a genetic dictatorship where they will
[14:10.000 --> 14:16.920]  not only own our bodies and have literally lawful ownership on our
[14:16.920 --> 14:20.760]  bodies that's the way they're going but they will genetically controllers and
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.960]  controllers through microchips that's where they want to go and if we're
[14:23.960 --> 14:28.520]  going to get pulled away into diversions of debates about this and debates about
[14:28.520 --> 14:32.960]  that there's one debate at the moment until we've sorted this why do they
[14:32.960 --> 14:37.360]  want to do ABC and D and that's the question we need to keep asking all the
[14:37.360 --> 14:42.080]  time to keep on top of where we're going and we know what they want they're so
[14:42.080 --> 14:46.640]  arrogant that they all write white papers on government health care on the
[14:46.640 --> 14:50.760]  environment movement on cap and trade they admit it's the shutdown industry
[14:50.760 --> 14:55.000]  bankrupt everyone have a huge state that's the only thing that's funded that
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.960]  literally absorbs humanity and begins accelerating their soft kill operations
[14:59.960 --> 15:03.760]  we know they've already been introducing poisons into our environment and into
[15:03.760 --> 15:06.880]  the vaccines and foods we've caught them we've got countless documents where
[15:06.880 --> 15:10.880]  they admit they're doing it now they want to accelerate that up to a hot kill
[15:10.880 --> 15:15.440]  level like we've seen in areas of Africa and thank God you're out there
[15:15.440 --> 15:20.040]  exposing these people well you know there are people that know there's a
[15:20.040 --> 15:24.960]  conspiracy there's people that know that there is a ridiculously few people
[15:24.960 --> 15:29.360]  who are pulling the strings of the world but we've still got a lot of what long
[15:29.360 --> 15:34.600]  way to go with with a lot of people to fully understand the scale of what
[15:34.600 --> 15:40.880]  we're dealing with the rabbit hole goes so deep it's staggering and we're not
[15:40.880 --> 15:45.800]  even dealing with just human entities we're dealing with non-human entities
[15:45.800 --> 15:49.760]  we're dealing with entities that operate outside the field of vision of what we
[15:49.760 --> 15:55.080]  call visible light which we which our eyes can see and appears to be this world
[15:55.080 --> 15:59.040]  there are other worlds well David I'll say there's a rate to penetrate this one
[15:59.040 --> 16:04.520]  and and we that it's involving those two so this is really really deep stuff
[16:04.520 --> 16:08.560]  that we're dealing with here not just what appears to be many dark suits
[16:08.560 --> 16:12.400]  sitting around a table deciding their next move much bigger than that well no
[16:12.400 --> 16:16.920]  I agree with you because I've studied the elite and they believe they're in
[16:16.920 --> 16:20.480]  contact with entities I've been to Bohemian Grove I've covered skull and
[16:20.480 --> 16:24.520]  bones I've read the Pentagon's own writings they believe they are being
[16:24.520 --> 16:28.560]  given every one of them it says they're channeling things that that they're
[16:28.560 --> 16:33.240]  being directed at the highest levels at the mid levels it's it's hedonist it's
[16:33.240 --> 16:38.480]  Satanist it's people that want money and power at the top these are very focused
[16:38.480 --> 16:44.760]  people working 18 hours a day and and and and they believe they're working for
[16:44.760 --> 16:48.240]  an entity that I can only describe as the devil people can call it whatever
[16:48.240 --> 16:51.880]  they want David stay there let's look at some other contemporary issues and from
[16:51.880 --> 16:56.240]  that window expand and go down the rabbit hole from different angles we'll be
[16:56.240 --> 17:02.080]  back with David Ike David Ike comms his website I'm Alex Jones with info
[17:05.680 --> 17:13.200]  I was a highway man along the coach roads I did ride David Ike is our guest
[17:13.200 --> 17:17.600]  we got into the border issue and how they're overrunning sovereign nations
[17:17.600 --> 17:22.200]  because the globalists want to remake the world in their system so any culture
[17:22.200 --> 17:26.080]  whether it's good or bad they want it out of the way or the corporate culture
[17:26.080 --> 17:31.520]  this is a short segment let's get into the oil spill David Ike the oil spill
[17:31.520 --> 17:37.360]  what's your research on that well the appalling things happening at the Gulf
[17:37.360 --> 17:44.800]  of Mexico now are a classic example of the the way the web the Illuminati web
[17:44.800 --> 17:51.280]  interfaces with different aspects of itself to create a coordinated policy
[17:51.280 --> 17:56.600]  and a coordinated agenda I mean you've got someone for instance like Peter D
[17:56.600 --> 18:00.920]  Sutherland who was a non-executive chairman of BTB until a few months ago
[18:00.920 --> 18:04.920]  he's also non-executive chairman of Goldman Sachs International he was the
[18:04.920 --> 18:09.520]  director of the World Trade Organization he was a director of actually
[18:09.520 --> 18:13.680]  the director general of the World Trade Organization he was a director of the
[18:13.680 --> 18:18.440]  Bank of Scotland in the run-up to the period where it crashed in 2008 and had
[18:18.440 --> 18:21.960]  to be bailed out by the taxpayer he's on this he'd been on the steering
[18:21.960 --> 18:25.040]  committee of the Bilderberg group he's a chairman of the Trial Action Commission
[18:25.040 --> 18:29.040]  he's a chairman of the London School of Economics one of the great Illuminati
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.280]  universities on the planet created by the Fabian Society his financial advisor
[18:33.280 --> 18:36.560]  the Vatican brought up in a Jesuit school the Jesuits of course are a
[18:36.560 --> 18:40.800]  major major player in this global web he's been one of the major people in
[18:40.800 --> 18:46.600]  Europe pressing for more and more power for the European Union and while he was
[18:46.600 --> 18:52.280]  non-executive chairman of BP you had a guy called Lord Brown who's who got out
[18:52.280 --> 18:57.400]  before they the stuff hit the fan over the Gulf of Mexico he was so appalling
[18:57.400 --> 19:02.880]  as the executive chief executive of BP that Tony Blair described him as his
[19:02.880 --> 19:07.920]  favorite businessman so you can see how bad he was and it was Lord Brown who
[19:07.920 --> 19:15.400]  instigated the policy of BP of cutting safety and cutting all they've got more
[19:15.400 --> 19:19.320]  violations in Houston alone I saw the number it's like over a hundred times
[19:19.320 --> 19:23.880]  what other oil companies have combined and they're the top fake environmentalist
[19:23.880 --> 19:29.040]  company that with Enron created the carbon tax scam with Al Gore exactly and
[19:29.040 --> 19:33.760]  this is how it all interfaces this is for how the how the web works you see BP
[19:33.760 --> 19:37.800]  but it's not just BP BP's connected to Goldman Sachs Goldman Sachs is connected
[19:37.800 --> 19:41.880]  to Halliburton and so it goes on and don't forget Queenie she owns a big part
[19:41.880 --> 19:47.560]  of it yeah Lord Lord Lord Brown was chief executive of BP when you had that
[19:47.560 --> 19:52.000]  massive explosion of the refinery in Texas City which people were of course
[19:52.000 --> 19:57.480]  were killed in it another environmental disaster in so many ways and and he
[19:57.480 --> 20:01.400]  instigated this BP policy not because they were struggling for money we must
[20:01.400 --> 20:06.640]  cut costs no because he wanted to expand and expand the profits of BP and one
[20:06.640 --> 20:12.120]  way you could do it was to was to cut costs so we cut costs on on safety on
[20:12.120 --> 20:16.520]  checks and all the rest of it and that was that the sequence of events that
[20:16.520 --> 20:20.760]  eventually led to what happened in the Gulf of Mexico and then when you look at
[20:20.760 --> 20:25.840]  Goldman Sachs again as I mentioned with Peter D Sutherland that's selling 44
[20:25.840 --> 20:29.880]  percent of its shares in BP in the run-up to what happened in the Gulf
[20:29.880 --> 20:34.680]  Tony Hayward the chief executive of BP that followed Lord Brown sold a lot of
[20:34.680 --> 20:38.920]  his shares in the run-up over a third Obama dumped his Vanguard stocks in it
[20:38.920 --> 20:46.560]  they all jumped it's got so many red flags all over it but it with a prior
[20:46.560 --> 20:51.880]  knowledge and and B that the thing was a disaster not waiting to happen the
[20:51.880 --> 20:57.160]  disaster was made to happen and then you look at what happened after that and
[20:57.160 --> 21:04.200]  so many mysteries kind of fade away when you know the story and what the goal is
[21:04.200 --> 21:10.160]  so the next mystery in all this is why BP and the federal government clearly
[21:10.160 --> 21:16.760]  have no real interest in reacting to this disaster to cleaning up the beaches
[21:16.760 --> 21:20.800]  to doing what is necessary white people countries would turn away when they
[21:20.800 --> 21:26.200]  offered help because they want this disaster to be as big as possible a yes
[21:26.200 --> 21:32.160]  to offer solutions like the carbon tax and all the rest of it now they their
[21:32.160 --> 21:37.880]  climate change scam has been falling apart but also there is a war by this
[21:37.880 --> 21:41.440]  cabal against the United States they want to destroy the United States
[21:41.440 --> 21:47.360]  militarily destroy it economically they want to destroy everything it stands
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.200]  for because that has to be brought under the under the heel of the global
[21:52.200 --> 21:58.320]  cabal if the world government is to have total power no more superpowers
[21:58.320 --> 22:02.000]  otherwise you don't have total power you've got the 10 regions as the UN
[22:02.000 --> 22:06.200]  says with the 10 global directors this has been on record since the 60s which
[22:06.200 --> 22:09.480]  they're now moving towards and that's what's so amazing they use the US as
[22:09.480 --> 22:14.480]  their henchmen as their funding mechanism while the US gets all the blame
[22:14.480 --> 22:19.120]  for the global imperial takeover and now as they get ready to destroy us they're
[22:19.120 --> 22:23.040]  moving towards devaluing the dollar the IMF World Bank or criticizing our
[22:23.040 --> 22:28.040]  monetary systems the UN is posing as the savior with the global cashless
[22:28.040 --> 22:32.400]  currency so they used us for their dirty work and then flushes down the toilet
[22:32.400 --> 22:35.560]  when they're done stay there David I quick break I want you to come back
[22:35.560 --> 22:40.000]  segue out of the BP into all these announcements that okay we are in a
[22:40.000 --> 22:43.880]  depression don't worry the same bankers that engineered it have got a global
[22:43.880 --> 22:47.480]  government that'll take care of it all for you they've got a fix they've been
[22:47.480 --> 22:50.720]  I'd straight ahead stay with us
[22:58.880 --> 23:04.440]  ladies and gentlemen Fox News in New York we're gonna talk to David about this
[23:04.440 --> 23:11.120]  later in the hour reported that they've got body scanners car scanners showed
[23:11.120 --> 23:15.080]  people being forced to drive through x-rays that shoot through cars with a
[23:15.080 --> 23:22.080]  gamma rays I mean this makes this makes chest x-rays look tame in comparison
[23:22.080 --> 23:25.920]  some of the units the cars driven up and then it scanned others that they drive
[23:25.920 --> 23:30.480]  the car through it and I guess they tell the foolish troops to do it oh it's
[23:30.480 --> 23:34.960]  okay go ahead and do it they're setting the precedent to literally microwave us
[23:34.960 --> 23:39.840]  in front of everyone well Watson did research and he's got an amazing article
[23:39.840 --> 23:45.080]  here New York National Guard involved in mass arrest of U.S. citizens and we got
[23:45.080 --> 23:50.320]  links down to mainstream news in part two how great it is that the guard has
[23:50.320 --> 23:56.080]  arrested 2,000 citizens for petty crimes including gun possession I mean this is
[23:56.080 --> 24:00.800]  martial law New York National Guard involved in mass arrest of U.S. citizens
[24:00.800 --> 24:05.340]  troops assist in over 2,000 arrests last year alone as America sinks in a total
[24:05.340 --> 24:08.240]  martial law and the same things happening all over the country and that's
[24:08.240 --> 24:12.480]  why we saw the Marist connectivity a few months ago call for martial law in that
[24:12.480 --> 24:17.160]  little sleepy town so we're going back to David I can a minute don't forget we
[24:17.160 --> 24:24.000]  have made films like in-game Invisible Empire a new order to find and of course
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.800]  the Obama deception that go into who these bankers are how they're controlling
[24:27.800 --> 24:31.360]  society and what their plan is and in this film in game gets into the
[24:31.360 --> 24:36.360]  extermination plan this film is free at info wars.com when you order it with
[24:36.360 --> 24:40.360]  Invisible Empire or several other of our newest films and I'm doing that because
[24:40.360 --> 24:43.720]  in-game I believe is probably my most important film and it's got to be seen
[24:43.720 --> 24:47.680]  quickly so info wars.com there's a link at the top of two different shopping
[24:47.680 --> 24:50.400]  carts that have basically the same specials got a deal we can get a free
[24:50.400 --> 24:55.160]  ball cap as well up at info wars.com we're asked about the free deals and
[24:55.160 --> 24:58.960]  combos when you call when you buy DVD get a free hat buy some t-shirts get a
[24:58.960 --> 25:03.560]  free hat and your purchase also makes this show possible the toll free number
[25:03.560 --> 25:11.800]  is 888-2533139 888-2533139 we'll get into this martial law police state
[25:11.800 --> 25:15.600]  cyber security now they're admitting censorship the internet with David in a
[25:15.600 --> 25:19.960]  moment but David segueing from the oil where do you think that's going a and b
[25:19.960 --> 25:24.440]  the media is now shifted in Europe as you know England and the US is saying okay
[25:24.440 --> 25:29.440]  it is a depression after telling us in a recovery now it's a depression what do
[25:29.440 --> 25:34.560]  you see unfolding with that leading into a possible strike on Iran what do you see
[25:34.560 --> 25:40.040]  from studying the globalist behavior in the past which is psychopathic and and
[25:40.040 --> 25:43.360]  they do it in patterns what do you see unfolding well on the Gulf they wanted
[25:43.360 --> 25:47.000]  to get as bad as possible to so they can exploit it as much as possible with
[25:47.000 --> 25:52.760]  with solutions to to the problem they've created in terms of the the economic
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.720]  situation I've been saying since 2008 that there's there's a three point plan
[25:56.720 --> 26:01.760]  here one was to crash the economy in 2008 so people could see there was a
[26:01.760 --> 26:08.560]  major problem this then justifies it doesn't really but in in their efforts
[26:08.560 --> 26:14.400]  to justify it they say it justifies a massive a staggering we still don't
[26:14.400 --> 26:20.520]  understand the scale of the transfer of wealth from the population to the banks
[26:20.520 --> 26:24.240]  and the elite that has gone on as a result of this bank bailout I was reading
[26:24.240 --> 26:30.080]  the other day an article about the fact that these toxic assets of these banks
[26:30.080 --> 26:35.480]  which the taxpayer money was supposed to have been paid over to to sort out the
[26:35.480 --> 26:41.120]  bank still own the toxic assets but for what this article was saying they don't
[26:41.120 --> 26:45.080]  have to appear on the balance sheet until they're sold so you've got a ticking
[26:45.080 --> 26:48.320]  time bomb there and you've got balance sheets that are being produced by banks
[26:48.320 --> 26:54.480]  that are absolutely nothing like the actual financial state of that bank
[26:54.480 --> 26:59.680]  but the the second point in this three-stage plan that I was talking
[26:59.680 --> 27:06.440]  about is 2008 was to empty the coffers of governments in terms of reacting to the
[27:06.440 --> 27:10.960]  economic situation and we have reached that now I mean what we're having in
[27:10.960 --> 27:19.680]  Britain is absolutely savage beyond belief cuts in public expenditure by
[27:19.680 --> 27:26.040]  the government to react to the incredible debt that they've been
[27:26.040 --> 27:31.360]  but the taxes go up so so a larger percentage of the taxes goes directly to
[27:31.360 --> 27:35.480]  the bankers who were the ones that created the 600 trillion conservatively
[27:35.480 --> 27:40.400]  in fake assets and and they won't tell Congress or Parliament where the money
[27:40.400 --> 27:46.160]  went exactly the same the same that thing over here in Europe in Britain
[27:46.160 --> 27:52.760]  during the the Brown Labor government that was replaced recently this amazing
[27:52.760 --> 27:59.480]  transfer of wealth went from taxpayers to the banking system and and to to the
[27:59.480 --> 28:05.720]  cabal network in general and now unbelievable levels of cuts in public
[28:05.720 --> 28:10.280]  expenditure are being instigated because they say with the we're in so much
[28:10.280 --> 28:13.880]  trouble because of the debt now wait for this mate I talked about you know I
[28:13.880 --> 28:17.720]  talked about earlier about everything connects into everything else the David
[28:17.720 --> 28:22.880]  Cameron government that has replaced the the Brown Labor government has
[28:22.880 --> 28:29.720]  appointed someone to oversee where these savage cuts of billions and billions of
[28:29.720 --> 28:34.160]  pounds are going to be made that are going to fundamentally affect the lives
[28:34.160 --> 28:39.360]  of everyone in this country guess who they've appointed Lord Brown former
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.360]  chief executive of BP who was responsible for the decisions that led up
[28:44.360 --> 28:48.680]  eventually to the Gulf oil disaster well that's like having all these former
[28:48.680 --> 28:52.600]  Goldman Sachs I mean that's like exactly that's like having all these former
[28:52.600 --> 28:56.240]  Goldman Sachs people running every position in the federal government
[28:56.240 --> 29:00.160]  getting the bailout money and then giving it to Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan I
[29:00.160 --> 29:05.560]  mean it is a new level of crime and now in the U.S. under the Federal Reserve
[29:05.560 --> 29:10.480]  expansion and powers they're being given a new secret office with unlimited
[29:10.480 --> 29:15.440]  funds to quote take over any area of the economy they wish so they're being given
[29:15.440 --> 29:19.240]  dictatorial power right now and the same things being done in Greece and
[29:19.240 --> 29:23.800]  everywhere else this is their global coup d'etat they're going for it all and
[29:23.800 --> 29:29.480]  then that segues into the UN and the IMF announcing we need to start phasing out
[29:29.480 --> 29:35.440]  all the currencies and going to an SDR basket and we need a global government
[29:35.440 --> 29:39.920]  that you pay your carbon taxes to to finance this and who are the biggest
[29:39.920 --> 29:45.320]  investors in carbon credits well it's Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase BP and a
[29:45.320 --> 29:49.760]  handful of others it's always the same inner cabal exactly and you've got this
[29:49.760 --> 29:57.320]  guy in America who was the great new Messiah Obama who if anything is worse
[29:57.320 --> 30:02.200]  than bush and that whole period because it's speeding up now I mean this man is
[30:02.200 --> 30:09.440]  is not even subtle he's just agreeing to everything necessary to allow this to
[30:09.440 --> 30:13.800]  speed up and speed up and speed up and I say this to people you know what's
[30:13.800 --> 30:20.240]  happening now was predicted a long long time ago not because of people sitting
[30:20.240 --> 30:24.920]  in darkened rooms smoking something and coming to some conclusions but from hard
[30:24.920 --> 30:30.760]  research from documents from from from written material saying what these
[30:30.760 --> 30:34.920]  people were planning to do and it's unfolding now it wasn't prophecy it
[30:34.920 --> 30:41.000]  was research now we have to then decide where do we draw the line here we didn't
[30:41.000 --> 30:44.760]  draw it when it was first pointed out because I was just conspiracy theorists
[30:44.760 --> 30:49.360]  what are we going to draw it now or are we going to draw it a few months down the
[30:49.360 --> 30:54.240]  road when it's even worse a year or two down the work down the road when what's
[30:54.240 --> 30:57.480]  happening today will be nothing compared with that when are we going to draw the
[30:57.480 --> 31:03.080]  line there's nothing nothing in anybody's life I don't care who they are I don't
[31:03.080 --> 31:07.840]  care where they are there's nothing more important in anybody's life than
[31:07.840 --> 31:12.760]  focusing on what is going on and we coming together as a population a
[31:12.760 --> 31:18.000]  respective of race religion color creed a income bracket and saying what are we
[31:18.000 --> 31:22.200]  going to do together to stop this because at the moment we have got a tail
[31:22.200 --> 31:29.880]  actually at the core a tiny tail wagging a massive dog and unless we start
[31:29.880 --> 31:34.000]  focusing on this and cut out the diversions that are designed to stop us
[31:34.000 --> 31:38.240]  focusing on this then it's just going to get worse but the power is still in our
[31:38.240 --> 31:43.920]  hands but there are so many of us and so few of those in full knowledge were
[31:43.920 --> 31:49.720]  actually manipulating us come on wake up something David I guess there's never
[31:49.720 --> 31:56.080]  nothing that we can do what can I do well sit down I can make a contribution
[31:56.080 --> 32:00.320]  to this how can you communicate this information even if it's calling into a
[32:00.320 --> 32:04.800]  radio show in the mainstream or something I just saying this is going on go to
[32:04.800 --> 32:09.360]  this website go to this radio program you don't tell you what's going on there's
[32:09.360 --> 32:13.520]  nothing but there's already a huge awakening happening we've got to
[32:13.520 --> 32:18.040]  accelerate it because not only is that little tail wagging this giant dog
[32:18.040 --> 32:23.880]  they're going to pose with their false solutions to the crisis they created
[32:23.880 --> 32:28.120]  that's their methodology as you know problem reaction solution to bring us
[32:28.120 --> 32:32.160]  deeper under their control unless we're there every step of the way going you're
[32:32.160 --> 32:36.320]  the crooks you're the social engineers you're the controllers you're the one
[32:36.320 --> 32:39.840]  that did this how assinine to give the Federal Reserve that engineered this
[32:39.840 --> 32:43.760]  even more power how assinine to give the Bank of England who engineered this on
[32:43.760 --> 32:47.640]  record more power look at your connections look at how you're involved in
[32:47.640 --> 32:51.720]  this look at what you've done we've got to be there that's why they want to shut
[32:51.720 --> 32:55.360]  down the internet because they're panic now let's talk about that Chinese net
[32:55.360 --> 32:59.440]  style censorship now coming to Australia coming to New Zealand coming to Italy
[32:59.440 --> 33:03.520]  coming to France open announcements in our news that yes it's going to be more
[33:03.520 --> 33:06.720]  draconian but to keep you safe because al-qaeda is about to shut the internet
[33:06.720 --> 33:10.000]  down so we've got to have the power to shut it down to save it we're going to
[33:10.000 --> 33:13.000]  track everything you do we're going to block what websites you can visit
[33:13.000 --> 33:17.920]  already info wars.com prisonplanet.com are already censored on the free
[33:17.920 --> 33:22.680]  broadband in many cities in Europe we've confirmed that the government here the
[33:22.680 --> 33:25.920]  FCC saying they're going to take it over Cass Sunstein saying is going to
[33:25.920 --> 33:31.440]  censor it there's no doubt that line in the sand if we don't stand up against
[33:31.440 --> 33:35.400]  tyrants is whatever we'll put up with as Thomas Jefferson said they aren't going
[33:35.400 --> 33:40.880]  to push it to the limit and so again showing that we have power David doesn't
[33:40.880 --> 33:44.200]  that indicated that now they are moving against the web even though that
[33:44.200 --> 33:48.320]  exposes them because they realize that that there is an accelerated awakening
[33:48.320 --> 33:54.760]  happening. Let me give you an example just a simple example of which is an
[33:54.760 --> 34:00.880]  example that can be expressed globally one of the appalling horrific things
[34:00.880 --> 34:05.680]  that's going on in the world again part of the agenda is for social services and
[34:05.680 --> 34:11.440]  police to steal children from their parents in extraordinary numbers now in
[34:11.440 --> 34:20.920]  America all over the world in Britain on the basis of fake news in England I
[34:20.920 --> 34:25.240]  mean for those that just tuned in that they've actually got quotas before a
[34:25.240 --> 34:29.760]  baby's even born and they admit they trump it up these are children snatchers
[34:29.760 --> 34:36.560]  stealing children at least in parts of America like California there I think
[34:36.560 --> 34:41.440]  it's all over America there are federal financial incentives for social
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.000]  services to take more and more children from their parents but the point I'm
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.560]  making here is that there's a lady named Maureen Spallock in Liverpool in
[34:49.560 --> 34:53.960]  England and she had her children stolen three of them years ago now and they
[34:53.960 --> 34:58.640]  were they were given away to foster parents by the social services and in
[34:58.640 --> 35:03.600]  the previous sense the Liverpool police and social services have run a vendetta
[35:03.600 --> 35:07.520]  against this woman as she tries to get her children back she was actually
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.680]  arrested it's just one example I could I could list a number of outrageous things
[35:12.680 --> 35:19.200]  that happened she was arrested and taken to court for sending a birthday card to
[35:19.200 --> 35:24.880]  one of the children that the state stole the other day a few days ago the
[35:24.880 --> 35:30.040]  Liverpool police picked her up again for sending a text message to someone they
[35:30.040 --> 35:38.040]  put her in jail in Liverpool and the reason that the family courts that
[35:38.040 --> 35:42.120]  decide all this are held in secret is not to protect the children as they
[35:42.120 --> 35:46.320]  claim is to protect the system and the Satanists and the pedophiles from
[35:46.320 --> 35:51.760]  stealing the children through social services the point I'm leading to however
[35:51.760 --> 35:58.360]  is this I put on my website when I heard about this how gutless disgusting and
[35:58.360 --> 36:03.840]  pathetic the Liverpool police were and a number for Liverpool police to let
[36:03.840 --> 36:06.920]  people say what they thought about what they were doing to this woman she was
[36:06.920 --> 36:12.340]  in custody at the time and a few hours later they let this lady go and they
[36:12.340 --> 36:17.120]  dropped the charges because they're compute their phone system crashed so
[36:17.120 --> 36:21.320]  many people rang in to complain at what they were doing to this lady that they
[36:21.320 --> 36:25.960]  hold phones they couldn't keep their child kidnapping going so they said open
[36:25.960 --> 36:28.960]  the phones up we got more kids to grab but it's actually come out in the
[36:28.960 --> 36:33.960]  telegraph that it's actually come out here in the US that they have quotas on
[36:33.960 --> 36:38.800]  what color hair eyes they that that before a mother has a child they're
[36:38.800 --> 36:43.280]  already planning the fake charges and it's come out over and over again that
[36:43.280 --> 36:47.560]  that so many of the CPS workers are pedophiles exactly because they can get
[36:47.560 --> 36:52.960]  away with everything nothing like all of them but the people that run the show
[36:52.960 --> 36:56.360]  invariably are I've been researching this for decades no I mean it's in the
[36:56.360 --> 37:00.880]  newspaper every day that they catch a top-top CPS workers the short point is
[37:00.880 --> 37:06.680]  though Alex but when people the public phone this police station in large
[37:06.680 --> 37:10.120]  numbers and said this is disgusting we're not having in other words the
[37:10.120 --> 37:16.480]  secrecy and and and the shadow level that they do this on was taken away this
[37:16.480 --> 37:21.640]  lady was released and the charges were dropped we have the power they're
[37:21.640 --> 37:26.040]  terrified of the public that's why they're arming against this that's why
[37:26.040 --> 37:29.120]  they're surveilling that's why they're admitting they're surveilling now
[37:29.120 --> 37:32.880]  because they know they've committed crimes they know they're run by crooks
[37:32.880 --> 37:39.640]  and they are scared yes but what we have to do is understand our power to change
[37:39.640 --> 37:43.960]  this you know we're talking about a handful of people in full knowledge
[37:43.960 --> 37:49.000]  manipulating the lives of billions what are we doing well that's why you've
[37:49.000 --> 37:53.320]  written the new book mankind get off your knees yeah human race get off your
[37:53.320 --> 37:58.840]  knees it's called it's just out and the subtitle is the lion sleeps no more
[37:58.840 --> 38:06.280]  because within us is a lion it is it is the real human being being suppressed
[38:06.280 --> 38:12.320]  by the the human being that has been programmed to think it has no power the
[38:12.320 --> 38:18.240]  human being to to fear authority to fear the consequences of taking on
[38:18.240 --> 38:23.280]  authority or refusing to cooperate with authority that's the lion I'm talking
[38:23.280 --> 38:26.880]  about within people and that line is starting to come out but it needs to
[38:26.880 --> 38:31.160]  come out in very much larger and we need the police and the military and others
[38:31.160 --> 38:34.160]  who are starting to wake up to realize your compartmentalized as well the
[38:34.160 --> 38:37.680]  globalists have genetically modified the GMO food to sterilize and give you
[38:37.680 --> 38:41.560]  cancer they've they add the chemicals of the water to sterilize you and give you
[38:41.560 --> 38:45.080]  cancer we have the all the government documents we've covered even Fox News
[38:45.080 --> 38:50.200]  reported yesterday that Marilyn has banned the by scene all a that they're
[38:50.200 --> 38:54.520]  putting in the plastic products that does sterilize men I mean the White House
[38:54.520 --> 38:59.240]  science are admits they're doing this you are under attack to and David you've
[38:59.240 --> 39:03.880]  talked about compartmentalization we need to get the police and military to
[39:03.880 --> 39:07.880]  realize even if they consciously see themselves as on the winning team and
[39:07.880 --> 39:12.000]  part of the New World Order they're not they are seen by the New World Order as
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.160]  an even bigger enemy than the general public in the globalist documents we've
[39:16.160 --> 39:21.560]  gotten that this is a point I think it's very important to stress to those in
[39:21.560 --> 39:25.000]  uniform and to those in the dark suits in government who are serving this
[39:25.000 --> 39:28.880]  system while not actually instigating that they're instigating it they're
[39:28.880 --> 39:35.200]  serving it you have no power I don't care if you're in the military I don't
[39:35.200 --> 39:40.480]  care if you've got how many kind of stars on your on your uniform I don't
[39:40.480 --> 39:44.440]  care what level of the police force you're in I don't care if you're doing
[39:44.440 --> 39:48.320]  roadblocks I don't care if you're pulling people off the street I don't care
[39:48.320 --> 39:56.480]  what you're doing you have no power your uniform has the power take your
[39:56.480 --> 40:01.760]  uniform off okay put it in the wardrobe where's your power go and get another job
[40:01.760 --> 40:08.600]  without that uniform where's your power you have no power you are employed to
[40:08.600 --> 40:13.800]  animate that uniform which is an extension of the state and that's all
[40:13.800 --> 40:19.520]  you are and therefore you are expendable while you give your soul away while
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.640]  you give your mind away while you give your morals and decency away advancing
[40:24.640 --> 40:31.560]  this this fascist dictatorship you will be okay with the fascist that you're
[40:31.560 --> 40:36.560]  serving but your children and your grandchildren have to live in the world
[40:36.560 --> 40:41.320]  you are creating I want that you're gonna have to understand that and I don't
[40:41.320 --> 40:45.880]  envy you that moment because it's gonna be horrific when it dawns upon you the
[40:45.880 --> 40:50.240]  world that you've actually created the people in uniform and the dark suits
[40:50.240 --> 40:54.480]  that administer the system while not being the originators of it they have
[40:54.480 --> 41:00.240]  to start breaking ranks okay get some backbone open your mind look at what's
[41:00.240 --> 41:07.400]  going on and get some fricking backbone before you administer and impose and
[41:07.400 --> 41:12.480]  enforce a world that will be grotesque for your children and grandchildren in
[41:12.480 --> 41:16.360]  fact not even not even that for yourself yeah you're not gonna have to wait now
[41:16.360 --> 41:20.760]  for your kids to be destroyed you know absolutely and David very well said
[41:20.760 --> 41:24.120]  there I want to try to keep you five minutes in the next hour before Sheriff
[41:24.120 --> 41:29.320]  Richard Mack so we have as much time as possible to go over issues but but I
[41:29.320 --> 41:34.360]  really do see the denial lifting people a lot of them don't have you know even a
[41:34.360 --> 41:37.760]  partial view of what's going on but they know something's wrong and that's why I
[41:37.760 --> 41:41.800]  challenge people to don't expect you're gonna save the world by yourself or
[41:41.800 --> 41:45.560]  overnight Hollywood pushes that image of Arnold Schwarzenegger or John Wayne
[41:45.560 --> 41:49.480]  saving everybody and people always look to me they look to you others you know
[41:49.480 --> 41:53.440]  Ron Paul you've got to save us no it's that act of defiance that active
[41:53.440 --> 41:57.640]  awakening that act of courage resistance is victory and it's understanding the
[41:57.640 --> 42:02.080]  enemy and it's everybody speaking out you know one little cricket isn't very
[42:02.080 --> 42:06.720]  loud but you get a field of those it is a deafening roar and we're a lot bigger
[42:06.720 --> 42:11.360]  and more powerful than a cricket and we've all just got to do little things
[42:11.360 --> 42:17.440]  every day and realize what's going on and this system will come to a halt and
[42:17.440 --> 42:21.760]  they know that and they are desperate to throw us into a crisis to make
[42:21.760 --> 42:26.160]  themselves matter to make us beach ourselves on their government on their
[42:26.160 --> 42:29.960]  corporate structure and so many people within their system are starting to
[42:29.960 --> 42:33.720]  defect so many people that have become powerful off their system call me
[42:33.720 --> 42:37.320]  contact me talk to me off record and they say I wish I would have known this I
[42:37.320 --> 42:41.480]  wish I so many people that even work for the system are compartmentalized and
[42:41.480 --> 42:46.080]  now through my broadcast your work and others they can finally see the larger
[42:46.080 --> 42:51.040]  paradigm around them from the cog that they filled and so by getting that full
[42:51.040 --> 42:55.320]  spectrum analysis they can then see the full spectrum dominance that the
[42:55.320 --> 42:59.080]  globalist have built I mean Rothkopf who we had on the show who wrote super
[42:59.080 --> 43:05.000]  class says there's less than 6,000 people that rule the world and only 20
[43:05.000 --> 43:10.000]  families that they serve so this is now admitted publicly and and and we can
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.960]  defeat these people we must defeat these people I've got two words to say
[43:14.960 --> 43:22.200]  Kendra Arneson who's come out and and and done so much great work exposing what
[43:22.200 --> 43:27.480]  BP are doing in the Gulf of Mexico and how the whole cleanup stuff is a sham
[43:27.480 --> 43:31.600]  how the the fishermen and other people are being exploited and treated
[43:31.600 --> 43:36.360]  appallingly now they've lost their their way of life they have to search BP
[43:36.360 --> 43:42.240]  he's not sending them checks that was yeah yeah she is a shining light of what
[43:42.240 --> 43:48.280]  can be done a few a few days ago a week or so ago and she was a mother and now
[43:48.280 --> 43:52.960]  she's standing up to these people and doing a magnificent job and anybody can
[43:52.960 --> 43:57.320]  do it it's just and if they arrest her it's gonna backfire and if they arrest
[43:57.320 --> 44:02.320]  her it's gonna backfire yeah of course and you know no one said it was gonna be
[44:02.320 --> 44:07.400]  easy I mean I mean this is the question are we gonna draw the line now Alex and
[44:07.400 --> 44:12.320]  and take the challenges and sacrifices that that takes to stay here and no
[44:12.320 --> 44:17.280]  further or are we gonna wait a bit a bit longer until they get more and more
[44:17.280 --> 44:21.920]  control and try to do it then and what with these agendas further down the road
[44:21.920 --> 44:26.560]  than it is now or a bit further than when are we actually gonna say enough you
[44:26.560 --> 44:33.480]  know because you know it's like that famous phrase by the Christian pastor in
[44:33.480 --> 44:37.160]  after Nazi Germany first they came for the Jews and I was not a Jew so I did
[44:37.160 --> 44:40.120]  nothing then they came for the trade unionists I was not a trade unionist so
[44:40.120 --> 44:43.320]  did nothing then I they came for the communists I was not a communist so I
[44:43.320 --> 44:48.720]  did nothing you know this is about all of us it's not about one group of people
[44:48.720 --> 44:53.240]  one income bracket one race one religion these are all fault lines for
[44:53.240 --> 44:58.160]  engineered divided rule the target is all of us so all of us need to come
[44:58.160 --> 45:02.920]  together put out put our hands together put our minds together and and say here
[45:02.920 --> 45:07.280]  and no further when we stop cooperating with the system the system cannot
[45:07.280 --> 45:12.000]  operate they cannot operate the system without our acquiescence we must stop
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.840]  acquiescing we must do it now human race get off your knees we have been there
[45:16.840 --> 45:22.200]  for long enough no more well the human race is getting up off its knees and
[45:22.200 --> 45:27.800]  that's why the system is howling with anger let's get into the police state
[45:27.800 --> 45:31.040]  and the minutes we've got left David and I want to hold you five over if you can
[45:31.040 --> 45:36.600]  do it okay but the I mean the police state it's even shocking me how fast
[45:36.600 --> 45:40.440]  they're moving we have now discovered just today this is unbelievably important
[45:40.440 --> 45:45.200]  news that all over the country not just New York but Illinois you name it the
[45:45.200 --> 45:51.000]  military Marines Army National Guard are arresting citizens nationwide with
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.920]  police and this has been going on for several years and I wasn't even aware
[45:54.920 --> 45:59.880]  now they're putting it out on TV like it's a good thing I mean again I didn't
[45:59.880 --> 46:04.680]  even know the magnitude David this is incredible yeah and it is what I called
[46:04.680 --> 46:09.160]  over the years the totalitarian tips of where you're you're at a and you know
[46:09.160 --> 46:13.760]  you're going to bed but if you go in too big a leap then people look up and say
[46:13.760 --> 46:18.600]  what's going on because the change in your in your your society is is so
[46:18.600 --> 46:23.280]  blatantly obvious so they do it in steps but of course the nearer they get to the
[46:23.280 --> 46:27.440]  goal the steps get quicker and quicker because it's a simple equation the more
[46:27.440 --> 46:31.640]  you centralize power the more power you then have to centralize even quicker and
[46:31.640 --> 46:36.720]  that's that's why the the momentum of centralization and dictatorship gets
[46:36.720 --> 46:40.240]  faster and faster than because the more power you have the quicker you can push
[46:40.240 --> 46:43.920]  it on the more power you have the quicker you can push it on with this is
[46:43.920 --> 46:48.320]  why we reached the point now where they've centralized so much power in so
[46:48.320 --> 46:52.680]  many areas of our lives that they can now push this this whole agenda on across
[46:52.680 --> 46:57.920]  a great spectrum of subjects in areas of our and they use every new crisis as a
[46:57.920 --> 47:03.320]  way to say no media no local officials no one's allowed you know you're not
[47:03.320 --> 47:06.960]  getting your checks for the phishing we've shut down you know you're not
[47:06.960 --> 47:09.920]  allowed to have a gun you're not allowed to protect yourself and we're like
[47:09.920 --> 47:14.840]  where's the law and they said we don't need any stinking law yeah what they've
[47:14.840 --> 47:19.120]  done in a series of steps getting faster and faster is these take away the
[47:19.120 --> 47:22.120]  checks and balances the checks and balances the checks and balances they
[47:22.120 --> 47:26.600]  did it most blatantly with the checks and balances they took away to stop the
[47:26.600 --> 47:31.600]  free-for-all in the financial markets the financial industry and look what
[47:31.600 --> 47:36.600]  that led to and every single time one of these checks and balances has been
[47:36.600 --> 47:42.040]  suggested to be taken away every time the people that could have stood up to
[47:42.040 --> 47:45.480]  that and thought well you know I'm not even can't be bothered all this I have
[47:45.480 --> 47:49.600]  no power to do that what can I do then they have played a part in where we've
[47:49.600 --> 47:55.680]  reached now so can we learn from that please and say okay we've made mistakes
[47:55.680 --> 47:59.400]  in the past when we didn't stand up to what we should have stood up to and so
[47:59.400 --> 48:03.240]  we better learn from those mistakes now and start standing up here because if we
[48:03.240 --> 48:09.120]  don't then it's going to be a lot more difficult down the road David Ike is our
[48:09.120 --> 48:11.960]  guest we're gonna do five more minutes with him and then Sheriff Richard Max
[48:11.960 --> 48:15.680]  coming on and I've got a few other key quick questions for David at the time
[48:15.680 --> 48:20.960]  with him and sure gone fast the new book is of course available at David Ike
[48:20.960 --> 48:25.880]  com our books videos materials are all available at info wars at com and
[48:25.880 --> 48:30.040]  supporting the type of work we're doing is so vital you don't need to be told
[48:30.040 --> 48:41.000]  that do you thank you for listening to GCN visit GCN live.com today
[48:48.520 --> 48:53.480]  all right we're in the final hour got Sheriff Richard Max coming up after this
[48:53.480 --> 48:57.360]  great but David Ike is our guest for another five minutes I was during the
[48:57.360 --> 48:59.960]  break I said what do you think's most important to finish off with and he said
[48:59.960 --> 49:05.840]  Albert Pike's letter and I've read his book morals and dogma of course this
[49:05.840 --> 49:10.200]  letter is reported to be at the British Naval Museum he was a Confederate
[49:10.200 --> 49:15.040]  general the founder of the Klan a British agent trying to break up the US with
[49:15.040 --> 49:18.840]  the Civil War and all of that's been confirmed but this letter is just
[49:18.840 --> 49:21.880]  amazing the way it predicted everything they've done so go over some of that
[49:21.880 --> 49:25.560]  letter the three phases in the last five minutes David go ahead well Albert Pike
[49:25.560 --> 49:32.360]  who of course was a massive massive Freemason an absolute Freemasonic God
[49:32.360 --> 49:37.840]  and of course his statue is in Washington DC right next to Washington DC
[49:37.840 --> 49:41.320]  police headquarters which is quite appropriate I would say we're dealing
[49:41.320 --> 49:44.800]  with Freemasonry and it's alleged that he wrote this letter to a guy called
[49:44.800 --> 49:51.680]  Mazzini a very infamous Illuminati operative and he predicted in this letter three
[49:51.680 --> 49:56.760]  world wars that were coming it was alleged to have been sent in or written
[49:56.760 --> 50:03.240]  in 1871 and the First World War he talks about the overthrow of the Czar's in
[50:03.240 --> 50:10.400]  Russia and and making the country a fortress of atheist communism etc he
[50:10.400 --> 50:15.520]  talks about bringing the British and Germanic Germanic empires into the
[50:15.520 --> 50:21.000]  war the Second World War must be fermented by taking advantage of the
[50:21.000 --> 50:24.880]  differences between the facet fascists and the political Zionists and talks
[50:24.880 --> 50:30.000]  about things that happened then but the point the point that it leads to is the
[50:30.000 --> 50:33.800]  Third World War which really I mean I've been saying for years that's the
[50:33.800 --> 50:39.600]  that's the plan which which it is and the description in the letter of the
[50:39.600 --> 50:43.840]  Third World War is absolutely describing the period we're going through now he
[50:43.840 --> 50:48.320]  says this the Third World War must be fermented by taking advantage of the
[50:48.320 --> 50:53.480]  differences caused by the Ajanta Ajanta of the Illuminati between the
[50:53.480 --> 50:57.160]  political Zionists and the leaders of the Islamic world the more must be
[50:57.160 --> 51:01.280]  conducted in such a way that Islam the Muslim Arabic world and political
[51:01.280 --> 51:05.440]  Zionism the state of Israel mutually destroy each other meanwhile the other
[51:05.440 --> 51:09.120]  nations once more divided on this issue will be constrained to fight to the
[51:09.120 --> 51:13.680]  point of complete physical moral spiritual and economic exhaustion we shall
[51:13.680 --> 51:17.840]  unleash the nihilist and atheists we shall provoke a formidable social
[51:17.840 --> 51:22.440]  cataclysm which in all its horror will show clearly to the nations the effect
[51:22.440 --> 51:27.720]  of absolute atheism origin of savagery and of the most bloody turmoil then
[51:27.720 --> 51:31.560]  everywhere the citizens obliged to defend themselves against the world
[51:31.560 --> 51:35.160]  minority of revolutionaries will exterminate those destroyers of
[51:35.160 --> 51:39.440]  civilization and the multitude is illusion with Christianity whose deistic
[51:39.440 --> 51:43.600]  spirits will from that moment be without compass or direction anxious for an
[51:43.600 --> 51:47.840]  ideal but without knowing where to render its adoration will receive the
[51:47.840 --> 51:51.320]  true light through the universal manifestation of the pure doctrine of
[51:51.320 --> 51:55.800]  Lucifer brought finally out into the public view this manifestation will
[51:55.800 --> 51:58.640]  result from the general reactionary movement which will follow the
[51:58.640 --> 52:01.880]  destruction of Christianity and atheism both conquered and exterminated at the
[52:01.880 --> 52:06.360]  same time he talks about the fact that they're going to make in effect the
[52:06.360 --> 52:13.200]  the global society so full of turmoil so full of upheaval that the people will
[52:13.200 --> 52:18.640]  turn to the the few that the cabal and say save us from it and the cabal will
[52:18.640 --> 52:23.680]  then say well to do that we must do this and we know in 1919 these are
[52:23.680 --> 52:28.280]  confirmed Lord Milner repeated it about creating a Germanic superstate to start a
[52:28.280 --> 52:32.120]  new war and we know they used World War one for the League of Nations we have
[52:32.120 --> 52:36.040]  the Carnegie documents about World War two being engineered I mean I mean this
[52:36.040 --> 52:41.360]  is real yeah I mean Milner was the the head of a secret society in London called
[52:41.360 --> 52:45.840]  the Round Table which spawned the Trial Actual Commission and the CFR Council
[52:45.840 --> 52:49.840]  of Foreign Relations the Royal Intrusion of International Affairs it spawned of
[52:49.840 --> 52:54.680]  course the Club of Rome the Bilderberg group eventually and David we're almost
[52:54.680 --> 52:59.840]  out of time do you agree front house of Rockschild is at the absolute center of
[52:59.840 --> 53:05.180]  this in the human world if you like and David we're almost out of time you've
[53:05.180 --> 53:07.760]  agreed to come back on sooner rather than later I'd like to keep you on the
[53:07.760 --> 53:11.120]  next month because a quickening is happening but do you agree briefly we
[53:11.120 --> 53:14.800]  are on the cusp of what could be World War three they are pushing us in that
[53:14.800 --> 53:19.000]  direction exactly that's that's always been that's always been the plan three
[53:19.000 --> 53:24.280]  world wars to change the world to to a global fascist dictatorship we do not
[53:24.280 --> 53:30.440]  have to play their game it's time to say no no more David amazing I look forward
[53:30.440 --> 53:32.760]  to speaking to you in the near future let me say bye to you during this break
[53:32.760 --> 53:36.720]  Sheriff Richard Mack with solutions on taking back our county straight ahead
[53:36.720 --> 53:39.280]  stay with us
[53:42.120 --> 53:47.880]  from his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information
[53:47.880 --> 53:54.560]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[53:59.160 --> 54:06.040]  well for the next 52 minutes we're joined by Bill still I remember I was
[54:06.040 --> 54:10.240]  already awake I knew what was going on I've been on the air about two years and
[54:10.240 --> 54:15.320]  I saw the documentary film the money masters and we played clips on it over
[54:15.320 --> 54:18.680]  and over again on my radio show and my local access television show I started
[54:18.680 --> 54:23.400]  out here in Austin and we sell the film it's over three hours long the money
[54:23.400 --> 54:28.040]  masters how banks create the world's money and use it to take over the planet
[54:28.040 --> 54:32.280]  and the banks by the way are run by you Genesis so that's why it's even more
[54:32.280 --> 54:39.120]  dangerous that they be stopped because these are maniacal people and it is to
[54:39.120 --> 54:45.160]  DVD set an incredible film so important well guess what after all these years he
[54:45.160 --> 54:50.560]  has made a new documentary the secret of Oz and he talks about you know is the
[54:50.560 --> 54:57.240]  the Wizard of Oz really a secret message about the banking cartel well I know
[54:57.240 --> 55:01.040]  it's not a secret message in the film explains that actually it's a play from
[55:01.040 --> 55:05.600]  the 1890s that exposes in fact I've actually read the original play it's
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.400]  very similar to film but admits it's about the Wizard of Oz and the bankers
[55:09.400 --> 55:13.800]  behind the curtain creating the fraud and getting rid of the gold standard and
[55:13.800 --> 55:18.680]  the the yellow brick road and so so so the film exposes these scallywags these
[55:18.680 --> 55:23.000]  Ponzi scheme operators who have now brought us to the point of world
[55:23.000 --> 55:27.520]  government run by them through their fraud and the devaluation of the dollar
[55:27.520 --> 55:32.160]  and so it's important to expose what they've done but it's also important to
[55:32.160 --> 55:37.680]  expose alternatives to their predatory financial black hole system that is
[55:37.680 --> 55:42.440]  designed to destroy societies and this film is incredible it just came out on
[55:42.440 --> 55:48.280]  DVD we've got it it's available at info wars.com the secret of Oz will put the
[55:48.280 --> 55:53.280]  shopping cart image up there for prison planet TV viewers and you can get 25%
[55:53.280 --> 56:00.560]  off the money masters when you order it with the secret of Oz and this film is
[56:00.560 --> 56:04.160]  so well done he's such an amazing filmmaker he's got so many big heavy
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.920]  hitters in the film explaining it and going over it like Peter Schiff Joe
[56:09.920 --> 56:15.440]  Farah it's just amazing and it has solutions so it shows you who the
[56:15.440 --> 56:19.920]  enemy is what they've done and the alternative and people are now more
[56:19.920 --> 56:24.800]  than ever ready for this information so get the new film at info wars.com I
[56:24.800 --> 56:29.520]  want to play the little four-minute trailer or part of it to the secret of
[56:29.520 --> 56:35.760]  Oz then we're gonna go to Bill still the amazing filmmaker here it is what's
[56:35.760 --> 56:40.080]  going on with the American economy foreclosures are everywhere unemployment
[56:40.080 --> 56:44.520]  is skyrocketing and it looks like this may only be the beginning what can
[56:44.520 --> 56:49.840]  government do the sad answer is under our current monetary system nothing it's
[56:49.840 --> 56:53.720]  not going to get any better until the root cause of the problem is understood
[56:53.720 --> 56:59.280]  and addressed there isn't enough stimulus money in the entire world to get us
[56:59.280 --> 57:04.160]  out of this hole well you can't borrow yourself out of debt no more than like I
[57:04.160 --> 57:08.680]  said before you cannot drink yourself sober and so we're gonna have a massive
[57:08.680 --> 57:14.080]  massive recession or let's call it a depression while the economy rebalances
[57:14.080 --> 57:18.480]  away from a service sector economy towards a good producing economy but
[57:18.480 --> 57:23.160]  could it be that all these problems are foreseen a hundred years ago by L. Frank
[57:23.160 --> 57:28.080]  Baum the author of the wonderful Wizard of Oz well the principle and most
[57:28.080 --> 57:34.920]  powerful symbolic reference is of course the yellow brick road and the silver
[57:34.920 --> 57:39.800]  slippers in the book version of the Wizard of Oz Dorothy slippers are made of
[57:39.800 --> 57:44.920]  silver as opposed to in the film version where Dorothy slippers are made of ruby
[57:44.920 --> 57:49.440]  you take away the silver slippers on the gold or yellow brick road and all of the
[57:49.440 --> 57:54.480]  other symbolism tends to be lost well it's no secret to any American that
[57:54.480 --> 57:59.440]  we're living in very precarious times Americans are being robbed blind and
[57:59.440 --> 58:03.840]  they don't even know who's doing the robbing a government should never go
[58:03.840 --> 58:08.360]  into debt it doesn't need to go into debt a government can issue the money it
[58:08.360 --> 58:12.880]  needs nobody in the government in either party is looking at solving the debt
[58:12.880 --> 58:18.560]  problem then the answer is it's going to go to into a depression as far as the I
[58:18.560 --> 58:22.960]  can see we can't get from where we are to where we need to be without a severe
[58:22.960 --> 58:27.760]  depression the government's mentality in general seems to be we'll do what we
[58:27.760 --> 58:32.400]  have to do and we'll worry about paying for it later but what you could do is
[58:32.400 --> 58:36.400]  pay for it now in other words you don't have to pay for it later you don't have
[58:36.400 --> 58:41.160]  to pay for it with that you can just pay for it with money nobody's even talking
[58:41.160 --> 58:44.380]  about the debt problem as such they're talking about the fact that she the
[58:44.380 --> 58:48.240]  bankers aren't making enough money to live in the way that they're accustomed
[58:48.240 --> 58:53.560]  to remember all this money we're giving them is at interest money we are
[58:53.560 --> 58:58.440]  borrowing to give to the banks then these very same banks have the audacity
[58:58.440 --> 59:05.040]  to loan this money back to us at more interest in 2009 the interest we paid on
[59:05.040 --> 59:10.160]  the national debt in one year was more than we spent totally on the Iraq war
[59:10.160 --> 59:17.520]  this system has got to go why haven't we heard this before because most of the
[59:17.520 --> 59:23.720]  media and Congress are beholding to the big banks for loans yes Congress still
[59:23.720 --> 59:28.600]  appropriates money but where do they get it again what they can't raise from
[59:28.600 --> 59:35.280]  taxes they borrow from banks in 2009 Congress will spend over four trillion
[59:35.280 --> 59:40.760]  dollars but they will have to borrow half of it the worst part is we aren't
[59:40.760 --> 59:46.080]  just giving the money away we're borrowing it to give it away I think we
[59:46.080 --> 59:51.760]  need to reconsider and rethink perhaps the very foundations of our economic
[59:51.760 --> 59:56.000]  and monetary system you want a new cause to embrace you want to do something
[59:56.000 --> 01:00:00.880]  good for humanity how about one simple reform that will fix most of the bad
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.960]  things in this world like hunger poverty disease and misery this is the
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:12.560]  ultimate civil rights struggle human kinds escape from serfdom the solution
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:16.560]  is the secret that's been hidden from us for over a hundred years all right
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:20.360]  folks that's part of the trailer it's up on info wars dot com and prison planet
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:24.320]  dot com you can get the secret of Oz or get the money masters with it if you'd

[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:43.000]  for decades doesn't mean others do and now the world is falling to these
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.080]  bankers who are able to just take over the planet with all this fiat currency
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.160]  this message is the stake that can be driven through their heart it literally
[01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:56.720]  is the silver bullet that can kill the werewolves it is the holy water that
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:02.080]  will burn count Dracula's face off if you will get it and get it out to
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:07.000]  everyone you know and have viewings and give copies to members of Congress and
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.560]  get aggressive the secret of Oz by the amazing filmmaker Bill still and Bill it
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:17.960]  is so great to see your work over the last 15 years I was going from memory
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:23.080]  but you corrected me it was 1900 when this original novel came out go over the
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:27.560]  time period they were having then with the bankers what the novel itself covers
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:35.120]  versus the film and why your new documentary is so important gosh well
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.720]  there's a mouthful of Frank bomb wrote the wonderful Wizard of Oz in 1900 as
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:48.960]  a result of the failure of essentially the Greenbacker movement to capture the
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:57.320]  presidency when William Jennings Brian Renfield president in 1896 bomb saw that
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.000]  the movement was dying he saw that the bankers and their gold money system was
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:08.600]  winning and so he wrote the Wizard of Oz just as he was as though he was firing
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:13.840]  a flare up into the night of history hoping somebody somewhere down the line
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:19.560]  generations later would catch on to what was going on and pick up the banner and
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:26.800]  that's what I've done I am in fact Alex the inspiration for the secret of Oz
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:33.480]  was came from you the last time I was on your show I had never heard this before
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:38.200]  wow I didn't know that and so you went and did the research and and to correct
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:43.760]  one more thing I support gold and silver because fiat currencies can be debased
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:47.920]  and you know at the time the bankers were using the hoarding of gold to
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:53.200]  manipulate the market so so it's not at all or nothing you believe in a fiat
[01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:57.480]  system issued by Congress which will be able to pay off the debt and truly
[01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:02.120]  empower the population and I think your system is a great system because now the
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:05.360]  bankers have ordered all the gold and once they're done killing the fiat
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.880]  system if we go back to a gold system then they'll have the monopoly all over
[01:03:09.880 --> 01:03:15.880]  again well it's funny I saw Peter Schiff on TV just yesterday of the day before
[01:03:15.880 --> 01:03:20.200]  and I love Peter Schiffer and Ron Paul let me say that right up front because we
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:25.520]  agree on 95% of the stuff but you know I just think they're dead wrong on the
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:31.880]  whole gold thing and Peter Schiff was was asked well gee if you believe that
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:35.640]  gold is the answer well then the United States in great shape because the US
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.400]  Treasury owns so much gold and Peter kind of goes well yeah but it hasn't been
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:46.240]  audited recently and they all poo pooed that but that's absolutely correct
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:53.140]  Fort Knox was unloaded in in the late 1960s and early 1970s even though the
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:58.840]  Treasury still keeps this massive amount of thousands of tons of gold on their
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:05.080]  books but it's not there so there's just a tremendous amount of disinformation on
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.520]  this whole thing well let's go over the facts and how the monetary system works
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:14.560]  briefly and where the bankers have taken us you know at this point and then
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:19.600]  let's get into the solutions that are in your film but I think the allegory of
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:24.880]  the wonderful Wizard of Oz is the best place to start as your film does we're
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.720]  about to go to break but let's start getting into that right now the
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:34.120]  parallels in the book well the light like it said in the trailer the biggest
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.920]  piece of symbolism is the silver slippers on the yellow brick road Dorothy
[01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:46.520]  slippers were only made to be Ruby in 1939 when the film was made because that
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:51.120]  that's when the technical process was new and so they changed the silver
[01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:56.560]  slippers which is what it was in the book to Ruby slippers for the movie and
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:01.800]  thereby most of the rest of the symbolism was lost in history but if you
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:06.240]  go back the book and you look at the illustrations Dorothy's slippers were
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:12.000]  silver and that that was a symbolism that the silver slippers which basically
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:21.640]  what was a less controlled more abundant form of money allowed Dorothy to
[01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:28.560]  tread safely on the dangerous yellow brick road the gold money standard I'd
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:33.080]  stay there we're gonna go to the Emerald City the man behind the curtain all of
[01:05:33.080 --> 01:05:37.720]  it straight ahead stay with us folks this is key information the secret of
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:40.760]  Oz straight ahead
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:54.360]  if you go back to the founding of this country they were fighting
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:58.840]  fractional reserve bankers and money manipulators go back to Christ time is
[01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:02.920]  fighting the money changers now you go study ancient Chinese history 3000
[01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:08.200]  years ago they were having revolts over this the manipulation of money if you
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.840]  look at Abraham Lincoln and before that Andrew Jackson it was all about the
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:16.960]  banks the Wizard of Oz is about the banks and money this is the issue because
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:20.720]  if you let private groups control your issuance of currency and credit
[01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:24.520]  through different manipulations you will be a slave what did Thomas Jefferson
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.760]  say if we ever let private banks and the corporations to grow up around them
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:32.240]  control the issuance of currency and credit our children will you know grow
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:38.000]  up homeless on the continent their forefathers conquered this is what we're
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.240]  talking about and Bill still the maker of the new film the secret of Oz he is
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:46.960]  such an excellent filmmaker such a great researcher continue you've gotten up to
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.600]  the silver slippers on the yellow brick road continue well let me continue with
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:56.320]  what you were just saying and yet all of all of these things throughout history
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:02.920]  have disappeared from history books so you have to ask yourself why and the
[01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:10.680]  reason it is that the banks control so much through loans and that's why I have
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.880]  a friend who's who was just laid off from a major television network and he's so
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:22.640]  mad at more at Morgan Bank because it came down to whether this TV network
[01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:26.880]  was going to pay the interest on their loans or they're going to lay off like
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:32.680]  the top 20 or 30 execs in this TV network and so they laid off the execs so
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:37.120]  you know that's how banks control the media they don't necessarily have to
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:42.200]  own them but if as long as you're mortgaged out to the max any business
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:45.880]  that's mortgaged out to the max can't go against the bankers that's why you see
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:49.920]  essentially ruled by banker in this country right now that's happened for
[01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:54.320]  for hundreds of years when farmers would start revolting and speaking out the
[01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:59.360]  banks would just call their loans which is why it's so amazing that we have and
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:03.560]  we'll talk about it later this wonderful example of correct banking system
[01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:07.640]  with the state bank of North Dakota and you know another thing that you said
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:12.480]  this is such an important issue as I pointed out in the trailer this is the
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:17.440]  ultimate civil rights struggle this ability of the bankers to loan
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:23.720]  government's money the absolute total solution to this is government borrowing
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:29.120]  should absolutely be forbidden by every nation on the planet nations have
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:34.080]  governments don't need to borrow like like Lincoln and Kennedy said they issue
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.680]  the currency it's backed up by them that's right that's exactly right and
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:42.760]  that's their most sovereign responsibility according to Abraham Lincoln not
[01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:47.640]  defending the nation not doing this or that it's it's to have control of the
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:51.680]  month the money system that's the most important thing of a nation and it's to
[01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:56.760]  it's to the point where we've reached depth saturation let me interrupt this
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:59.880]  is short segment long one coming up me and you can roll with all your great
[01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:06.480]  info but but bill even a lot of our listeners probably go you mean the
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:11.880]  government borrows money from bankers but it says us money no it doesn't says
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:16.560]  Federal Reserve note well that's why you always see people saying oh the
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.000]  government's printing too much money they're not printing it they're borrowing
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.880]  it that's twice as bad explain that in layman's terms but they're not the
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:31.320]  government is not printing money it's borrowing money by the issuance of us
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:37.000]  bonds that's how every single dollar in your pocket is created as a debt in this
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.880]  country it's the debt money system that's what they try to hide that's why
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.960]  they try to have their politicians continually say oh we're gonna pay down
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:50.240]  the national debt impossible you cannot possibly pay down the national debt
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:54.640]  because to eliminate the national debt would be to eliminate your money to
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.120]  eliminate a portion of the national debt would be to eliminate a portion of
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:03.400]  your money we need to go to a non-debt money system where the government
[01:10:03.400 --> 01:10:07.800]  issues the money debt-free without the interest it's the interest that's
[01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:11.400]  killing and that's what the Constitution says their job is Congress
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:14.880]  controls the issuance of currency and credit but I watched Bernanke before
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:18.600]  Congress telling Ron Paul you're not allowed to even know what we're doing
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:22.920]  because you're not supposed to be involved in it I mean this is completely
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:28.280]  180 degrees the opposite of the truth that's exactly right and it boils down
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.000]  to a question of whether you want bankers in control or you want Congress in
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:39.160]  control despite the fact that Congress might be corrupt etc etc government is
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:45.160]  all we've got it's a blessing from God given us to try to control the banking
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.960]  establishment that is the essential thing the difference between we had a
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.120]  real government like Thomas Jefferson Kennedy tried to block them they killed
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.040]  him I mean look look you need honest fair money as the agreed-upon mode of
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.640]  exchange and then goods and services and ideas or what have the value instead of
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:07.680]  this parasite economy waging war against the real economy notice this the big
[01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:11.080]  mega bankers that fund all the eugenicists and the fake environmentalists
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.240]  and it's the carbon tax they're going to use to destroy our society they are at
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:19.920]  war against real wealth it is a black hole that you mathematically cannot pay
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.600]  back and that's what your film explains this these people it's either us or them
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.920]  ladies and gentlemen Bill stills our guest secret of Oz available on DVD at

[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:55.000]  like a water cooler without the water bottle on top grabs water out of the
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  air that's what clouds are for those that are public school educated like
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:01.400]  myself and condenses it and then sends it through seven twelve filters

[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:14.960]  dot com or eight hundred six nine one sixty forty three a cola blue dot com
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:19.680]  okay going back to bill still the maker of the secret of oz if we just let these
[01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:25.360]  bankers bill put it this way and let's get back into the film i've read and
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:30.360]  scanned over and had ron paul on yesterday the banker reform act that's
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:34.360]  passed the house and the senate but they have a different version so it's they
[01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.360]  have different versions right now for those that just tuned in
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.360]  even the washington post admits but said it was a good thing that all the
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:46.360]  federal reserve will be given near complete power an autonomy to take over
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:50.360]  any financial institutions they want their smaller competition state banks
[01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:54.360]  local banks and this there is six hundred trillion in derivatives and this
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:16:00.360]  will fix it i thought the tarp did a year and a half ago and i mean it's
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:03.360]  incredible so the group that's engineered this let's give them even more
[01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.360]  it's not just you know we've got to beat them now if we don't expose them now
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.360]  and give real solutions they're going to use the crisis they created for even
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:16.360]  more power yeah it's ruled by banks i mean this isn't going to fix the crisis
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:22.360]  for example june twenty-fifth newsweek article by michael hersh put it this way
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:27.360]  the bill quote effectively anoints the existing banking elite the bill makes
[01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:31.360]  it likely that they will be the future giants of banking as well
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:36.360]  for all time you know for example do you know who the biggest investor in bp is
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:42.360]  oh yes goldman sacks oh jp morgan oh they were the biggest but they dumped
[01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:46.360]  some of their stock right before i forgot right well you know and and everybody
[01:16:46.360 --> 01:16:50.360]  everybody's jump jump on goldman sacks i mean they they get a they get a lot of
[01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:54.360]  they should get a lot of blame but jp morgan in the derivatives mess is like
[01:16:54.360 --> 01:17:00.360]  fifty times bigger than goldman sacks dwarfing goldman sacks jp morgan is
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:04.360]  the center of this whole black hole and also want to say something else i just
[01:17:04.360 --> 01:17:08.360]  came back from a trip to sweden germany and iceland and i do want to talk about
[01:17:08.360 --> 01:17:14.360]  iceland yeah i know you had better jita on a couple days ago but um
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:18.360]  you're big and there are people in sweden and iceland right now listening to this
[01:17:18.360 --> 01:17:24.360]  program right now your name is well known over there
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:28.360]  well worldwide people are waking up thanks to your work you certainly helped
[01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:33.360]  educate me how how many years ago did the money masters come out
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.360]  it was fourteen to fifteen years now yeah i want to digress i didn't know that
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.360]  it was this show that uh... that inspired you to go down the yellow brick road
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:46.360]  with a secret of ours what was said on the show and i've been aware of that
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:51.360]  forever but i didn't happen to happen to mention that there was some type of
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:54.360]  symbolism related to the wizard of ours and i've never heard that before i
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:58.360]  didn't believe how somehow i had missed this and i jumped on the web and
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:03.360]  immediately thought that this was uh... had been the the talk in uh... uh...
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:09.360]  economics academia for about twenty years and so i said oh yeah this is the
[01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.360]  perfect vehicle because to me the money masters
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:17.360]  well i've always been looking for a way to re-film it because we did it so long
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:21.360]  ago it was even before digital i mean it was filmed in high eight for example
[01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:24.360]  and it's just getting you know a little worn out looking if you ask me
[01:18:24.360 --> 01:18:27.360]  and also it's too long and i couldn't figure out
[01:18:27.360 --> 01:18:30.360]  you know how can we do this in a shorter format so it's a more effective
[01:18:30.360 --> 01:18:34.360]  political tool and that's i think what what we've done here we filmed the
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:38.360]  secret of ours in hd well i mean the money masters is an authoritative
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:42.360]  classic and it's deep in history in the whole system i mean i can't believe
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:45.360]  you're kind of knocking your masterpiece there
[01:18:45.360 --> 01:18:49.360]  well i just i i think this is a more effective political tool i mean
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:53.360]  it takes somebody pretty dedicated to sit down for three hours and twenty three
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:56.360]  minutes you know now that this you can sit down and spend a hundred minutes
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:59.360]  and uh... and get the same story
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:02.360]  well it does i mean it does look christberg's a shot in high def but i mean
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.360]  i just got to commend all of it because i know i'm instrumental but i am the type
[01:19:05.360 --> 01:19:08.360]  of guy that will sit down and watch c-spam for three hours so i guess
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.360]  i get your point but you travel all over the world for this
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:16.360]  let's talk about some more of what the film covers
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.360]  i want to say something first first of all about uh...
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:23.360]  i want people to be hopeful here and uh... you know i think
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.360]  the good the good part that's going on right now
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:30.360]  is these guys always get way over arrogant with their power
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.360]  i think obama the whole obama thing
[01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:36.360]  they totally overplayed their hand
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:40.360]  they're trying to bite off way too much the american people is way
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.360]  hip to this whole thing and uh... they're going to crush them
[01:19:44.360 --> 01:19:49.360]  the bad news is although we we might win we might push out a lot of the bad guys
[01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:52.360]  the beggars have wrecked the hell out of us
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.360]  we might push a lot of them out of the next election
[01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:59.360]  uh... you know uh... that's still not going to fix it unless we we fix the
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:03.360]  monetary system unless unless we fix the debt problem
[01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:05.360]  we're never going to fix this
[01:20:05.360 --> 01:20:08.360]  uh... under the current scheme of things
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:11.360]  we have to go out of the debt money system
[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.360]  and the uh... and the ability of the bank to create
[01:20:14.360 --> 01:20:19.360]  ninety eight percent of our money and you went to iceland to show how the same
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.360]  groups are robbing them same groups in greece look at grace
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:26.360]  they're telling him you've got to give up your pensions everything germany spain
[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:29.360]  portugal and the people don't know this money
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:33.360]  and then on top of it if you look at the case of greece six hundred plus islands
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:38.360]  their roads their infrastructure having to give it to the very private banks that
[01:20:38.360 --> 01:20:41.360]  set them up they should be a resting
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.360]  we'll never beat them in those two countries there's only two countries where
[01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:49.360]  we have a shot and that's the united states and iceland i've been an iceland
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:54.360]  the reason we have a shot there is because the people are mad iceland is the home of
[01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:58.360]  the vikings they're very proud of their country and they are mad right now
[01:20:58.360 --> 01:21:01.360]  you know what i found out once i got in country
[01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:06.360]  but not only uh... were their interest rates indexed to inflation
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:11.360]  their principal on their mortgages is indexed to inflation and so after they
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:14.360]  they got killed the hell out of the icelandic corona
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:18.360]  it had doubled and tripled these people's house payments
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:21.360]  they're getting foreclosed on kicked out of their houses
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:26.360]  the bankers wrote it just to rob everybody describe what you saw on the ground in iceland
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:31.360]  that's what i'm saying so there's now a movement that has sprung up
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:35.360]  which goes out and surrounds a person's house it's about to be foreclosed on
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:40.360]  and they've been very successful they just thought an absurdist party just took
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.360]  control of the capital city of rinkebank called the best party
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:51.360]  and we formed a monitor reform working group when we were over in iceland
[01:21:51.360 --> 01:21:56.360]  or helped to form it and we're presenting an idea called the best bank
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:59.360]  based on the bank of north dakota to them next week
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:04.360]  we have an excellent chance i spoke to three members of parliament when i was there
[01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:08.360]  we have an excellent chance of bringing about a right money system in iceland
[01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:12.360]  because these people are so mad and so fiercely independent
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:16.360]  and i urge you alex and everybody in the sound of my voice
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:21.360]  to support icelandic products at this point just to help them
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.360]  to be sure that americans are going to support them in this effort
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.360]  and the way you can do that is you can go to the nordic store
[01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:30.360]  nordicstore.com
[01:22:30.360 --> 01:22:35.360]  whole food also carries a lot of icelandic products
[01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:39.360]  and buy icelandic
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.360]  because they are literally the alamo in the fight against the bankers
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:45.360]  they are the front line and they are standing up against this evil
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.360]  when every other country is falling
[01:22:48.360 --> 01:22:51.360]  yeah that's right and they're one of the smallest economies
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:54.360]  and so it's going to be a battle royale but they're willing to fight it
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.360]  and america has to support them and the way we can really support them
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.360]  is to buy their products
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:03.360]  well as you said time is running out for the bankers
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:08.360]  but they have already ruined our economy so badly
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:10.360]  briefly describe
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.360]  because i know you have this at the end of the money masters
[01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:14.360]  and the similar plan in this one
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.360]  a very well researched program to extricate ourselves
[01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.360]  from this fraudulent money system
[01:23:20.360 --> 01:23:22.360]  and get back on a constitutional system
[01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:26.360]  that built this nation until the bankers took over in 1913
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:28.360]  we had almost zero inflation
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:30.360]  sometimes deflation with our currencies
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.360]  our savings were strong
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:36.360]  and on average a 10.1% yearly growth rate in the economy
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.360]  we don't have that anymore
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.360]  so we built our nation without the income tax
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:43.360]  that came the same year as the fellow reserve
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:46.360]  that's part of the communist manifesto these bankers created
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.360]  that's right the bankers created communism
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:50.360]  to sucker everybody back into slavery
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:52.360]  communism has served them
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.360]  globalism has treason
[01:23:54.360 --> 01:23:56.360]  and let's go over your plan
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:24:00.360]  the plan to rectify things
[01:24:00.360 --> 01:24:05.360]  well basically you have to eliminate the ability
[01:24:05.360 --> 01:24:10.360]  number one job one is to eliminate the ability of governments to borrow
[01:24:10.360 --> 01:24:14.360]  national debt should be absolutely illegal
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:19.360]  and there's a couple of approaches that we can use to do that
[01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.360]  you can create debt free money
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:24.360]  from congress
[01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:27.360]  and issue it into the economy
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:29.360]  as the new money comes in
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:32.360]  and we pay off the national debt with the new money
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:35.360]  we gradually raise bank reserve requirements
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.360]  so at the end we have no national debt
[01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:42.360]  and we have banks only able to loan out money they actually have
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:45.360]  that way banks no longer can create money
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:48.360]  and only the government creates money
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:51.360]  we don't want to eliminate commercial banks
[01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:54.360]  just as they've done with the bank of North Dakota
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:57.360]  the state bank of North Dakota works in cooperation
[01:24:57.360 --> 01:24:59.360]  with the local banking community
[01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.360]  the local banking community loves them
[01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.360]  the state bank of North Dakota kind of serves as a many federal reserve
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:07.360]  completely outside of the federal system
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:11.360]  this model can be used in every state in the union
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:14.360]  and can go a long way towards eliminating
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.360]  every state deficit in this country
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:20.360]  I urge everybody to go on the state bank of North Dakota website
[01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:24.360]  and probably in every state in this nation right now
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:27.360]  there are people in your state attempting to bring about
[01:25:27.360 --> 01:25:29.360]  in the state legislature
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:32.360]  the state bank of North Dakota concept
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:35.360]  find them if you can't find them start your own group
[01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.360]  that's the thing that we can do
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:39.360]  let's look at the other side of this
[01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.360]  because of industrialization, because of technology
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:45.360]  we could all be living like literal kings
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.360]  and when you read with Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, the UN, Club of Rome
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:51.360]  the finance that they say
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:54.360]  we want carbon tax to shut down the industrialized society
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:59.360]  they know that humanity tends to be wealthy now
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:01.360]  and then that makes us not dependent on them
[01:26:01.360 --> 01:26:04.360]  and the government, the banks control
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:08.360]  and so they actively admit they've created a black hole monetary system
[01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:14.360]  that makes us poor and they've made this type of austerity
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.360]  a beautiful thing, but not for them, for us
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:20.360]  they've doled up their neo-surfdom and feudalism
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:22.360]  as something beautiful and good
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:24.360]  so if we don't stop them
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:27.360]  their goal is to make us debt slaves
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:30.360]  these are premeditated wicked people
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.360]  can you speak to your research along that line?
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.360]  their goal is to return us to a state of serfdom
[01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:39.360]  and that is the key fight
[01:26:39.360 --> 01:26:42.360]  through all the history of humanity
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:45.360]  whether or not humanity will be able to escape serfdom
[01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:48.360]  and that's why government is such a precious gift
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:52.360]  because it is the only thing that stands between us and serfdom
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.360]  they want to eliminate that
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.360]  that's why they love to corrupt government
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:59.360]  and make government look bad
[01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:02.360]  and that's why Congress has such low ratings
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:04.360]  and if we just eliminate...
[01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.360]  and they say privatize it
[01:27:06.360 --> 01:27:08.360]  but that's another form of corporate governance
[01:27:08.360 --> 01:27:12.360]  we only see enemies as nations like Russia or China
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.360]  but really it's a corporate takeover
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.360]  that's the treason
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:18.360]  I am for small government
[01:27:18.360 --> 01:27:20.360]  I'm for our republic
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:22.360]  that then guards us
[01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.360]  because we are the government
[01:27:24.360 --> 01:27:26.360]  and guards our freedom
[01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:30.360]  centralization of power at every level is a bad thing
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:33.360]  decentralization of power at every level
[01:27:33.360 --> 01:27:36.360]  is almost always a great thing
[01:27:36.360 --> 01:27:39.360]  and that's what the whole concept of state governments
[01:27:39.360 --> 01:27:42.360]  and the U.S. federal system
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.360]  that the states remain sovereign
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:46.360]  that the states have plenty of power
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.360]  and of course that's what Obama is directly attacking
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.360]  we have to decentralize power
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:54.360]  we have to get the U.S. out of the U.N. for the most part
[01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:57.360]  get it out of all these international banking agreements
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:00.360]  decentralization is a good thing
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:05.360]  well you're absolutely right
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:07.360]  and I think people are beginning to discover that
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.360]  the fake libertarianism of O.C. governments bad
[01:28:10.360 --> 01:28:12.360]  let us privatize it
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.360]  but that's not privatization to take roads we built with our money
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:18.360]  and then give it to bankers to put toll roads on it
[01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.360]  that's not free market
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:23.360]  well you know another thing we can do in the interim period
[01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.360]  this Tobin tax is really a great thing
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.360]  that hits at the heart of the high frequency trading
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:34.360]  if you just put a 1% tax on all of these high frequency trades
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:37.360]  you know it could raise approximately
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:40.360]  between 5 and 7 trillion dollars
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.360]  for the U.S. economy
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.360]  we only collect a little over a trillion in income tax
[01:28:45.360 --> 01:28:48.360]  we could wipe out all of our taxation
[01:28:48.360 --> 01:28:51.360]  but again the income tax goes to interest of the bankers
[01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.360]  this is the tax rates just on the income tax
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:55.360]  in six months that go up
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:57.360]  10% bracket goes up to 15
[01:28:57.360 --> 01:28:59.360]  that's poor people folks
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:01.360]  25% bracket goes to 28
[01:29:01.360 --> 01:29:03.360]  28 goes to 31, 33 to 36
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.360]  35 to 39.6
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:06.360]  basically 40
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.360]  and they've gotten rid of most of the exemptions
[01:29:08.360 --> 01:29:10.360]  and they're raising all these other taxes
[01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:13.360]  I mean and almost all of this is going to the bankers
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.360]  well you know you're absolutely right
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.360]  and we stand at such a critical juncture right now
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:21.360]  they're trying to seal their deal
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:23.360]  to make it impossible for us to escape
[01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:25.360]  but they way overplay their hand
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:28.360]  and now we've learned the secret of prosperity
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:32.360]  and that is just eliminate their ability to collect interest from us
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:33.360]  on our very money
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:36.360]  we don't have to rent our money into existence
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.360]  stay there, stay there
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.360]  final segment straight ahead the film is
[01:29:43.360 --> 01:29:45.360]  a lot of key news up at GCNLive.com
[01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:47.360]  scientists have been Kim Drills
[01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:49.360]  are creating artificial clouds
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:51.360]  mainstream news
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:54.360]  dollar plunges after you and call to Ditch Greenback
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:56.360]  that's up at GCNLive.com
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:01.360]  we've got a Ron Paul interview from yesterday
[01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:03.360]  posted up at GCNLive.com
[01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:04.360]  an amazing article
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:07.360]  popular music is the Babylon system
[01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.360]  another mainstream London Guardian article
[01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:11.360]  that Watson wrote about it
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:13.360]  where they admit that world government and Illuminati
[01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:16.360]  is being promoted all over the media
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:18.360]  by Lady Gaga everything
[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:19.360]  that's all at GCNLive.com
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:21.360]  and of course backed up at InfoWars.com
[01:30:21.360 --> 01:30:23.360]  and PrisonPlanet.com
[01:30:23.360 --> 01:30:25.360]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:26.360]  and of course on Monday
[01:30:26.360 --> 01:30:28.360]  but this 4th of July
[01:30:28.360 --> 01:30:30.360]  I meant to get into the Declaration of Independence
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.360]  and I'll probably get into it Sunday
[01:30:32.360 --> 01:30:33.360]  but everybody should read this
[01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.360]  because this is what the 4th of July is all about
[01:30:35.360 --> 01:30:37.360]  and they understood the type of tyranny
[01:30:37.360 --> 01:30:39.360]  they were facing and quite frankly
[01:30:39.360 --> 01:30:41.360]  it's nothing compared to what we're facing
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:42.360]  this is more scientific
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.360]  dehumanizing
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:46.360]  the globalists admit they're transhumanists
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:48.360]  who want us to be feudal slaves
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:51.360]  they admit they're not going to give us any quarter
[01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:53.360]  they admit they want to bankrupt us
[01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:56.360]  I mean they constantly brag about it
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:58.360]  but if we just put out the alternative
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.360]  to their tyranny
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:01.360]  they will fall
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:03.360]  and that's why Bill Still's new film
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.360]  The Secret of Oz is so important
[01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.360]  again it's available at InfoWars.com
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:09.360]  we've got 4 minutes left sir
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:11.360]  going out you've got the floor
[01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:13.360]  closing comments about your new amazing film
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.360]  alright well I would just boil this down
[01:31:15.360 --> 01:31:17.360]  to 3 quick sound bites as far as
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:18.360]  what to do
[01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:19.360]  what to take it from here
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:21.360]  on the international level
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360]  support Iceland
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.360]  Iceland is our best shot
[01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:27.360]  to get a toehold for a correct money system
[01:31:27.360 --> 01:31:28.360]  in the world system
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:30.360]  once we get it in Iceland
[01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:31.360]  then I was in Sweden
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:33.360]  I could have pointed to Iceland from Sweden
[01:31:33.360 --> 01:31:35.360]  and Sweden would have paid more attention
[01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.360]  the way you do that is you go to
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:39.360]  icelandnaturally.com
[01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:41.360]  nordicstore.com
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.360]  or Whole Foods
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:46.360]  sells a lot of Icelandic stuff
[01:31:46.360 --> 01:31:48.360]  on the state level
[01:31:48.360 --> 01:31:50.360]  support the state bank concept
[01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:52.360]  based on the Bank of North Dakota
[01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:55.360]  it's a way for states to regain sovereignty
[01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:58.360]  you're going to see next year's legislative session
[01:31:58.360 --> 01:32:01.360]  at least 6 if not 10 or 12 states
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.360]  the state bank issue will come up
[01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:07.360]  what that means is that states no longer have to borrow
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:09.360]  they no longer have to float bond issues
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:12.360]  they're totally saved all the interest payments
[01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:16.360]  and their money is put more in their control
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:20.360]  on the national level it all boils down to just one phrase
[01:32:20.360 --> 01:32:24.360]  one phrase fixes everything on the national level
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.360]  and that's no more national debt
[01:32:27.360 --> 01:32:30.360]  if you eliminated the ability of the government to borrow
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:33.360]  they would have to face the political consequences of spending
[01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:36.360]  immediately because they'd have to raise taxes
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.360]  so that would solve everything else
[01:32:39.360 --> 01:32:43.360]  we'd have to eliminate the entire national debt
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:46.360]  and that's my solution in three quick steps
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.360]  I'll say it again it's us through them
[01:32:48.360 --> 01:32:50.360]  there's no more time to screw around
[01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.360]  the world government's out in the open
[01:32:52.360 --> 01:32:55.360]  the solution is the same banks that ripped you off
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:58.360]  will now have a world government and you'll pay carbon taxes to them
[01:32:58.360 --> 01:33:00.360]  and the dollar will be under its controlled
[01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:04.360]  unelected bankers they've already got our banking system here
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:08.360]  now they want to bring it openly to the offshore corporations
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:11.360]  and it's the magnitude of this
[01:33:11.360 --> 01:33:13.360]  I know a lot of people didn't want to believe it
[01:33:13.360 --> 01:33:15.360]  the media would demonize you a decade ago
[01:33:15.360 --> 01:33:17.360]  if you talked about the Federal Reserve being private
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.360]  and as Ron Paul and others have said
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.360]  the globalists are now very upset
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:24.360]  because even though they were able to kill his audit the Fed bill
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:27.360]  it got massive cosponsorship
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:30.360]  and people are now at universities and everywhere
[01:33:30.360 --> 01:33:34.360]  talking about the corporate illegitimate takeover of America
[01:33:34.360 --> 01:33:39.360]  and now the elite is being recognized as the enemy
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.360]  the puppet presidents people are realizing are just that puppets
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.360]  I can say one more thing
[01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:50.360]  eliminating the Fed will not fix the problems
[01:33:50.360 --> 01:33:52.360]  national debt is the solution
[01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:54.360]  no no I agree with you
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.360]  but I mean we've got to certainly get rid of the feds
[01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:59.360]  we can turn the monetary control back over to Congress
[01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:03.360]  we'll have you back on Bill still soon to talk more about the film
[01:34:03.360 --> 01:34:04.360]  and play some clips of it
[01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:06.360]  Secret of Oz available at infowars.com
[01:34:06.360 --> 01:34:08.360]  great talking to you
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:10.360]  have a great 4th of July Bill
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:12.360]  great job to the crew
[01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.360]  great job to the listeners, the affiliates, the sponsors
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:15.360]  all of you
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:20.360]  the retransmission starts now on the audio streams at infowars.com
[01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:27.360]  Big Brother mainstream media
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:29.360]  government cover-ups
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:31.360]  you want answers?
[01:34:31.360 --> 01:34:32.360]  well so does he
[01:34:32.360 --> 01:34:36.360]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:34:36.360 --> 01:34:39.360]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.360]  Alex Jones
[01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.360]  All right I'm back with you
[01:34:43.360 --> 01:34:44.360]  this is Ted Anderson
[01:34:44.360 --> 01:34:47.360]  actually Alex is taking some much needed R&R
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:49.360]  building a studio
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:52.360]  television full blown out studio
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.360]  like you find over at Fox
[01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:55.360]  and places like that
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.360]  really working his tailbone off
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.360]  to make this message come to you
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:01.360]  and I need to say
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.360]  I know he appreciates all of you for listening
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.360]  and I certainly do too
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:09.360]  I've been very blessed to have Alex Jones
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:12.360]  as a partner in business for so many years
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.360]  and I just need to say
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:15.360]  that he's been an excellent addition
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:17.360]  to the Genesis Communications Network
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:20.360]  and I am forever grateful
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:22.360]  much needed R&R though
[01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.360]  his kids are grown up
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360]  everything's happening in his life
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:26.360]  he needs to have a little time off
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.360]  he's doing a Sunday
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:29.360]  and then Monday through Friday's show
[01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.360]  it's just a little too much every now and then
[01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:33.360]  you need to take a break
[01:35:33.360 --> 01:35:34.360]  I just wanted to get back to you
[01:35:34.360 --> 01:35:37.360]  I know I've got a lot of people that are asking me about
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.360]  this $600 reporting thing
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.360]  when you're buying gold in 2012
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:44.360]  now leave it to the politicians
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:46.360]  to pass a health care bill
[01:35:46.360 --> 01:35:48.360]  and then they take away our liberty
[01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:50.360]  now they want to have 1099 form
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.360]  and have a microscope on what we're buying
[01:35:53.360 --> 01:35:55.360]  especially in the gold and silver market
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:35:58.360]  no thanks to Barack Obama
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.360]  and all the congress that passed the health care bill
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.360]  it's just one more huge cut
[01:36:05.360 --> 01:36:07.360]  against our liberty
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.360]  and for those of you who haven't had a chance to see this
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:11.360]  it's all over the place on the internet
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.360]  but we have a hard copy of it
[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:15.360]  there is a representative
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:17.360]  his name is Dan Lungren
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:19.360]  he's trying to pass HR 5141
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:21.360]  I suggest that you support this
[01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.360]  he has 80 co-sponsors
[01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.360]  if they do pass this thing
[01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:27.360]  it'll strip it right out of the health care bill
[01:36:27.360 --> 01:36:29.360]  and we'll no longer have to worry about
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.360]  having the government have a microscope
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.360]  on our transactions for gold and silver
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:35.360]  for those of you who like to have the privacy
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.360]  not have the government in their life
[01:36:37.360 --> 01:36:38.360]  and in their business
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:40.360]  I mean what do you think is next
[01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:42.360]  it's just terrible that they're doing what they're doing
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:45.360]  and again Alex asked me to put this up for you
[01:36:45.360 --> 01:36:47.360]  and I need to tell you right now
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:50.360]  the Frank is at $265
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:52.360]  and we're giving you a full year subscription
[01:36:52.360 --> 01:36:54.360]  to the international forecaster
[01:36:54.360 --> 01:36:57.360]  you hear Bob Chapman up here every Friday
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:59.360]  and he's talking about the economic conditions
[01:36:59.360 --> 01:37:02.360]  and once again you want to know more about this
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:04.360]  health care reform bill
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.360]  and how in the world do you get reporting
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.360]  gold and silver in a health care reform bill
[01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:09.360]  well it's there
[01:37:09.360 --> 01:37:11.360]  and you should know more about it
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:16.360]  so call us at 1-800-686-2237
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.360]  and get your copy of this
[01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:24.360]  $600 reporting item
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:26.360]  that's in the health care bill
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:27.360]  that's going to make it
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:29.360]  so you can't even trade precious metals
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:31.360]  over $600 without having
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:33.360]  to have the government form filled out
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.360]  I mean you know what's next
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:37.360]  when you're going to be buying diapers for your baby
[01:37:37.360 --> 01:37:39.360]  I mean how far down the road
[01:37:39.360 --> 01:37:41.360]  are they going to go with this thing
[01:37:41.360 --> 01:37:44.360]  and this is just absolutely absurd
[01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:46.360]  and it shouldn't be there
[01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:48.360]  the United States people should be able to buy
[01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:51.360]  with their money if it's their money
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:53.360]  without having to have the government
[01:37:53.360 --> 01:37:55.360]  big brother standing over their back
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:37:57.360]  trying to figure out what they're trying to do with it
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:59.360]  this whole show has been about today
[01:37:59.360 --> 01:38:01.360]  about the Federal Reserve System
[01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:02.360]  the national debt
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:05.360]  and what the United States is doing to our currency
[01:38:05.360 --> 01:38:07.360]  and now they're trying to plug a loophole
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.360]  that makes it so they can watch
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:10.360]  to see if you're buying gold and silver
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.360]  why do you think they want to know that
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:15.360]  you know this Alan Wiener in New York
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.360]  is saying that the government does not have
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.360]  the power nor the control to come in
[01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:20.360]  and take your gold from you
[01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:22.360]  well I got news for you in 1933
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.360]  Franklin D. Roosevelt did exactly that
[01:38:25.360 --> 01:38:27.360]  he paid $20 an ounce for gold
[01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.360]  and then raised the price of gold
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:31.360]  just months later
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:33.360]  up to $30 an ounce
[01:38:33.360 --> 01:38:35.360]  it was $36 an ounce for gold
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.360]  and you know just a big hit
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:39.360]  to the people that turned in their gold
[01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:43.360]  it's just an attack on our liberty
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.360]  the United States people should not stand for this
[01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:49.360]  and let's not let this happen
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.360]  this Dan Lungren's got $51.41
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:54.360]  call your senator and congressman
[01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.360]  tell him you want to get that no
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.360]  and if you need a copy of this bill
[01:38:57.360 --> 01:38:59.360]  or what's going on with this
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:02.360]  call us at 800-686-2237
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:04.360]  and get a copy for you
[01:39:04.360 --> 01:39:06.360]  and then pass it around to everybody you know
[01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.360]  we need to be able to trade a currency
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.360]  here in the United States
[01:39:09.360 --> 01:39:11.360]  without having big brother on our back
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:12.360]  thanks for listening
[01:39:12.360 --> 01:39:14.360]  we have a really great show lined up for you
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:15.360]  continue to listen
[01:39:15.360 --> 01:39:17.360]  Alex will be back very soon
[01:39:17.360 --> 01:39:34.360]  and you'll be able to hear the next part of it
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:36.360]  well the Wall Street Journal is now reporting
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:38.360]  that they believe the United States
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.360]  will completely collapse
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.360]  by next year we're going to be going over that headline
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:45.360]  MSNBC has guest analysts on
[01:39:45.360 --> 01:39:48.360]  saying buy guns, barbed wire and farmland
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:50.360]  more and more people are sounding
[01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.360]  just like Gerald Salento
[01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:53.360]  who's been predicting exactly what's happening
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:56.360]  right now for at least the last six to seven years
[01:39:56.360 --> 01:39:57.360]  with precision
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.360]  he called it in 2008
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:02.360]  he said by 2010 the stimulus would have run out
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:05.360]  by the middle of 2010 it would be clear
[01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:08.360]  that the establishment knew full well what was happening
[01:40:08.360 --> 01:40:10.360]  that's now unfolding
[01:40:10.360 --> 01:40:13.360]  and I have incredible news here
[01:40:13.360 --> 01:40:17.360]  we actually got the MSNBC script
[01:40:17.360 --> 01:40:20.360]  for the rise of the new right special
[01:40:20.360 --> 01:40:22.360]  they're going to be airing over and over again
[01:40:22.360 --> 01:40:23.360]  starting next Wednesday
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360]  hosted by Chris Matthews
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.360]  they lied to me
[01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.360]  but I knew they were lying
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:31.360]  I told them I said this will be me
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:35.360]  cut into neo-nazis and militias
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.360]  and you will demonize Ron Paul and Rand Paul
[01:40:37.360 --> 01:40:39.360]  and they said no no we're just profiling you
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.360]  and it's all friendly
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:42.360]  we want to know the Tea Party
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:43.360]  well I have the script
[01:40:43.360 --> 01:40:45.360]  none of what I said was in there
[01:40:45.360 --> 01:40:47.360]  basically it's all distorted
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:49.360]  nothing about reaching out to the controlled left
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:52.360]  explaining to them that the false left right paradigm
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:53.360]  none of it
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.360]  it is worse than I thought
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:57.360]  and the article is up on
[01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.360]  prismplanet.com
[01:40:58.360 --> 01:40:59.360]  MSNBC hit piece
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:02.360]  smear's Tea Party as neo-nazis
[01:41:02.360 --> 01:41:05.360]  this is so important
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:08.360]  and so we're going to get Gerald Salente's take on that
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:09.360]  on the economy
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:10.360]  on the Iran situation
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.360]  the Israeli flotella
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:13.360]  all of it
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:15.360]  really Gerald Salente needs no introduction
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:17.360]  I can look at our
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:18.360]  prismplanet.tv numbers
[01:41:18.360 --> 01:41:20.360]  our web streaming numbers
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.360]  just the phone calls we get
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:23.360]  the YouTube channel
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.360]  this is the most popular guest we have on
[01:41:26.360 --> 01:41:28.360]  on a monthly basis
[01:41:28.360 --> 01:41:30.360]  sometimes we have a Charlie Sheen on
[01:41:30.360 --> 01:41:32.360]  or Willie Nelson or Jesse Ventura
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.360]  once every 3-4 months or so
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:36.360]  a couple times a year
[01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.360]  that will have more viewers or listeners
[01:41:38.360 --> 01:41:39.360]  but as our regular guest
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:42.360]  people really appreciate
[01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:45.360]  the straight talk of Gerald Salente
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.360]  and he really doesn't need any introduction
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.360]  but he is the
[01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:51.360]  Trends Research Institute founded in 1980
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:54.360]  TrendsResearch.com is a long illustrious bio
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:41:57.360]  find out more at TrendsResearch.com
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:59.360]  or in the past interviews we've done with him
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.360]  at prismplanet.com
[01:42:01.360 --> 01:42:02.360]  and infowars.com
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.360]  Gerald so much is happening
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.360]  so much is unfolding
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.360]  good to have you here with us
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.360]  well thanks for having me Alex
[01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:12.360]  a lot going on
[01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:14.360]  I want to get into the economy first
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.360]  but what is your take on
[01:42:16.360 --> 01:42:18.360]  the Mayak report the Homeland Security reports
[01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.360]  demonizing patriots gun owners
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:22.360]  now got the New York Times
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:24.360]  where they're cracking down on Amish
[01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:26.360]  trying to take their property saying it's not good
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:28.360]  for the environment that their cows
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:30.360]  are defecating
[01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.360]  that's not normal now
[01:42:32.360 --> 01:42:34.360]  you cannot make this up this is a full out
[01:42:34.360 --> 01:42:36.360]  assault on anyone
[01:42:36.360 --> 01:42:39.360]  who wants to be self sufficient
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.360]  I've said this before
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:43.360]  that in the mainstream media
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:46.360]  and a number of these
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:49.360]  talk show blowhards out there
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:51.360]  they keep calling what's going on in America
[01:42:51.360 --> 01:42:54.360]  socialism the ones that don't like Obama
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:42:56.360]  we've made it very clear
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:58.360]  that the merger of state and corporate powers
[01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:00.360]  by definition
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:02.360]  is called fascism
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.360]  so what we're seeing is first we're seeing
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:06.360]  the merger of state and corporate powers
[01:43:06.360 --> 01:43:08.360]  like never before
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.360]  with the whole guys of the too big to fails
[01:43:10.360 --> 01:43:12.360]  and look at the facts
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.360]  you go back to their early 1990s
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:16.360]  the top banks
[01:43:16.360 --> 01:43:18.360]  the top six banks
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.360]  had about 15%
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.360]  of the
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.360]  action out there
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:26.360]  now the top six banks
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.360]  control
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:30.360]  65%
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.360]  of all the financial assets in the United States
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.360]  so as we become more fascist
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:37.360]  what you're seeing now
[01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.360]  is the squeezing of the little people
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:41.360]  oh those dangerous Amish
[01:43:41.360 --> 01:43:43.360]  you have to really watch out for them
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:46.360]  you never know when their horse and buggies
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.360]  will be taken over another town
[01:43:48.360 --> 01:43:50.360]  and it's squeezed the little people at every end
[01:43:50.360 --> 01:43:52.360]  look what they're doing to the small farmers
[01:43:52.360 --> 01:43:54.360]  making it almost impossible
[01:43:54.360 --> 01:43:56.360]  for them to compete
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.360]  as they're becoming more popular
[01:43:58.360 --> 01:44:00.360]  look at the numbers
[01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.360]  the IRS doing
[01:44:02.360 --> 01:44:04.360]  they're cracking down on the little people
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:06.360]  as they're turning a blind eye
[01:44:06.360 --> 01:44:08.360]  to the big corporations
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.360]  so that's what's going on
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:12.360]  and as you pointed out
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:14.360]  how the MSNBC
[01:44:14.360 --> 01:44:16.360]  did a snow job on you
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.360]  they do it with everybody
[01:44:18.360 --> 01:44:20.360]  in making the Tea Party look like
[01:44:20.360 --> 01:44:22.360]  as though it's a right wing
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.360]  fanatical movement
[01:44:24.360 --> 01:44:26.360]  of right wing nuts
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:28.360]  and it's the same story
[01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.360]  let's go back over the history
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:32.360]  in 2007 in the Trends Journal
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:34.360]  our top trend for that year
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.360]  while Bush was president
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:38.360]  was that we were going to see the emergence
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.360]  of major tax revolts
[01:44:40.360 --> 01:44:42.360]  what did they do
[01:44:42.360 --> 01:44:44.360]  they ignored it
[01:44:44.360 --> 01:44:46.360]  in 2009
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:48.360]  the first Tea Parties
[01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.360]  and tax protests
[01:44:50.360 --> 01:44:52.360]  what did they do in the mainstream media
[01:44:52.360 --> 01:44:54.360]  they ridiculed it
[01:44:54.360 --> 01:44:56.360]  they said it was going nowhere
[01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:58.360]  they no longer turned a blind eye to it
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:00.360]  and it started gaining momentum
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.360]  what do they do next
[01:45:02.360 --> 01:45:04.360]  they demonize it
[01:45:04.360 --> 01:45:06.360]  so it's a very familiar pattern
[01:45:06.360 --> 01:45:08.360]  we know where they're going
[01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:10.360]  and they're not going to be able to stop it
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:12.360]  it has a life of its own
[01:45:12.360 --> 01:45:14.360]  well that's my next point
[01:45:14.360 --> 01:45:16.360]  we see three weeks of a hoax
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:18.360]  saying that Rand Paul
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:20.360]  wants to get rid of the Civil Rights Act
[01:45:20.360 --> 01:45:22.360]  which he never even talked about
[01:45:22.360 --> 01:45:24.360]  is not on his platform
[01:45:24.360 --> 01:45:26.360]  yes you do
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.360]  and his approval rating
[01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.360]  went up and one poll was 16%
[01:45:30.360 --> 01:45:32.360]  it went up to 20%
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:34.360]  another poll was 20%
[01:45:34.360 --> 01:45:36.360]  it went up to 25%
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:38.360]  he gained between three to six points
[01:45:38.360 --> 01:45:40.360]  and a whole index of polls
[01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:42.360]  after three weeks of 24-7
[01:45:42.360 --> 01:45:44.360]  basically saying he was the second
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.360]  coming of Adolf Hitler
[01:45:46.360 --> 01:45:48.360]  so what does that say to Chris Matthews and others
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:50.360]  that's what I told Politico
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:52.360]  I said look if you want to hurt
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:54.360]  Rand Paul
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.360]  endorse him
[01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:58.360]  you guys are shooting an empty gun
[01:45:58.360 --> 01:46:00.360]  more and more there's less and less people
[01:46:00.360 --> 01:46:02.360]  that believe a word
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.360]  that comes out of your stinking mouth
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:06.360]  of course it's the same old
[01:46:06.360 --> 01:46:08.360]  belt
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:10.360]  Washington Beltway circle jerk
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:12.360]  turn them on
[01:46:12.360 --> 01:46:14.360]  it's the same guys
[01:46:14.360 --> 01:46:16.360]  over and over
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:18.360]  in the same tired old faces
[01:46:18.360 --> 01:46:20.360]  saying the same old things
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:22.360]  the only people that are
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.360]  listening to them are themselves
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:26.360]  the whole nation
[01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.360]  is going in another direction
[01:46:28.360 --> 01:46:30.360]  again we'll only stick
[01:46:30.360 --> 01:46:32.360]  with the facts
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:34.360]  they ridicule the tea party
[01:46:34.360 --> 01:46:36.360]  they said it would go nowhere
[01:46:36.360 --> 01:46:38.360]  the lefties hate them
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:40.360]  they've turned them into
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:42.360]  again a stereotype
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:44.360]  that does not encompass
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:46.360]  the full meaning of the movement
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:48.360]  so just as they do Alex
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.360]  when there's a mass demonstration
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.360]  like the ones they just
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:54.360]  had in Greece
[01:46:54.360 --> 01:46:56.360]  or the ones they have in the US
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:58.360]  they throw in the agents
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:00.360]  provocateurs
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:02.360]  to make it seem as though
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:04.360]  the whole thing is nothing but
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:06.360]  an anarchist movement
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:08.360]  they're doing the same thing by demonizing
[01:47:08.360 --> 01:47:10.360]  the tea party
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:12.360]  sure there are lunatics in there
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:14.360]  unlike
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:16.360]  the respectable lunatics
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.360]  to the democratic party
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.360]  like President Obama
[01:47:20.360 --> 01:47:22.360]  who has sent
[01:47:22.360 --> 01:47:24.360]  more troops into Afghanistan
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:26.360]  who has expanded
[01:47:26.360 --> 01:47:28.360]  the mass murder in Pakistan
[01:47:28.360 --> 01:47:30.360]  oh well
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:32.360]  very respectable
[01:47:32.360 --> 01:47:34.360]  because as you've heard me say
[01:47:34.360 --> 01:47:36.360]  they're among the elites
[01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:38.360]  the Harvard Princeton Yale
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:40.360]  bullets, bombs and banks
[01:47:40.360 --> 01:47:42.360]  group they only do
[01:47:42.360 --> 01:47:44.360]  things with pinkies up
[01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.360]  in a dignified way
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.360]  they kill you with drones
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.360]  God forbid
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:52.360]  they would never have an AK-47
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:54.360]  so what they do is
[01:47:54.360 --> 01:47:56.360]  they make it seem as though
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:47:58.360]  the people
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.360]  of the movement
[01:48:00.360 --> 01:48:02.360]  are all out of their minds
[01:48:02.360 --> 01:48:04.360]  they're all head to the hills
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.360]  with pork and beans
[01:48:06.360 --> 01:48:08.360]  and barricade yourself in
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:10.360]  because the end of the world is coming movement
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:12.360]  rather than
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.360]  getting to the depth and breadth
[01:48:14.360 --> 01:48:16.360]  of this movement
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:18.360]  it's not going to be the tea party
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:20.360]  that really brings forth
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:22.360]  to change
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:24.360]  but it's the first element
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.360]  of something very big
[01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:28.360]  I said this over and over again
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:30.360]  and I'll say again
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.360]  it's the same sword to pop out
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:34.360]  to show us that the country is very sick
[01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.360]  again it's the beginning
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:38.360]  of the second American Revolution
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:40.360]  it's underway
[01:48:40.360 --> 01:48:42.360]  the Chris Matthews
[01:48:42.360 --> 01:48:44.360]  the Obermans
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:46.360]  the rest of them are not
[01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:48.360]  going to stop it
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:50.360]  it's happening
[01:48:50.360 --> 01:48:52.360]  they could ridicule it all they want
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:54.360]  again it's the same
[01:48:54.360 --> 01:48:56.360]  Washington Beltway
[01:48:56.360 --> 01:48:58.360]  circle jerk
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:00.360]  I go into these websites
[01:49:00.360 --> 01:49:02.360]  the liberal ones like Raw Story
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:04.360]  they're so
[01:49:04.360 --> 01:49:06.360]  proud of calling themselves progressives
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:08.360]  progressives every day
[01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:10.360]  and there they have what John
[01:49:10.360 --> 01:49:12.360]  Stewart said
[01:49:12.360 --> 01:49:14.360]  what Stephen Colbert said
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:16.360]  how about what Bozo the clown
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.360]  said
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:20.360]  clowns that's it and these are the ones
[01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:22.360]  they look up to so the liberals
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:24.360]  look up to the clowns
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:26.360]  the Colbert
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:28.360]  and the stewards
[01:49:28.360 --> 01:49:30.360]  and they make fun of the rest
[01:49:30.360 --> 01:49:32.360]  it's incredible
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:34.360]  and in the right way you think Sarah Palin is going to save them
[01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.360]  but that's not going to happen and the other good news
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:38.360]  is that the Republican or Democrat
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:40.360]  whether it's Arlen Specter
[01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:42.360]  or Grayson
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:44.360]  they are all being thrown out
[01:49:44.360 --> 01:49:46.360]  by the more extreme
[01:49:46.360 --> 01:49:48.360]  the more extreme you are
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:50.360]  according to mainstream media
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:52.360]  because they're up on the hill
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:54.360]  like Buddha pronouncing what reality is
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:56.360]  the more extreme you are
[01:49:56.360 --> 01:49:58.360]  the more the mainstream media demonizes you
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.360]  the faster you get put into office
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.360]  again look at the people that just won the elections yesterday
[01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.360]  oh you're real
[01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:06.360]  fireballs out there
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:08.360]  in California for governor
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:10.360]  and senator
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:12.360]  come on look at these people
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:14.360]  what does women women spend
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:16.360]  80 million dollars
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.360]  what are they
[01:50:18.360 --> 01:50:20.360]  what do they do so great
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:22.360]  what do they say that's so enlightening
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:24.360]  you put somebody in office
[01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:26.360]  to run against them
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:28.360]  like a Rand Paul
[01:50:28.360 --> 01:50:30.360]  that brought the Tea Party to a whole level
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:32.360]  that was never admitted to
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:34.360]  before they can't withstand it
[01:50:34.360 --> 01:50:36.360]  so what do they do
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:38.360]  they take the cheap shots
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:40.360]  look what just happened with this woman
[01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:42.360]  Helen Thomas where 89 years old
[01:50:42.360 --> 01:50:44.360]  boy do they beat her up
[01:50:44.360 --> 01:50:46.360]  boy do they show how tough
[01:50:46.360 --> 01:50:48.360]  they are
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.360]  and what do they do
[01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.360]  they defuse the whole
[01:50:52.360 --> 01:50:54.360]  atrocity that Israel
[01:50:54.360 --> 01:50:56.360]  committed by boarding
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:58.360]  the Turkish ships
[01:50:58.360 --> 01:51:00.360]  in international waters
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.360]  and out of the news
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.360]  and instead
[01:51:04.360 --> 01:51:06.360]  they hung 89 year old
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.360]  Helen Thomas up
[01:51:08.360 --> 01:51:10.360]  as someone to show
[01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:12.360]  don't mess around with them
[01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.360]  yeah that's right we'll put out the pasture
[01:51:14.360 --> 01:51:16.360]  old cow can't even stand up
[01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:32.360]  Gerald Salente stay there we're going to come back
[01:51:32.360 --> 01:51:34.360]  Gerald Salente is our guest

[01:51:46.360 --> 01:51:48.360]  hour

[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:20.360]  with North Korea the media saying
[01:52:20.360 --> 01:52:22.360]  Ben Laudans now and I ran
[01:52:22.360 --> 01:52:24.360]  he's like a chess piece they move
[01:52:24.360 --> 01:52:26.360]  they could move him I guess to the Amish property
[01:52:26.360 --> 01:52:28.360]  they're trying to take right now and say
[01:52:28.360 --> 01:52:30.360]  Ben Laudans in a Pennsylvania Amish community
[01:52:30.360 --> 01:52:32.360]  we've got to drop nukes on them
[01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.360]  I want to discuss that
[01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:36.360]  what's happening in North Korea
[01:52:36.360 --> 01:52:38.360]  but before we go any further
[01:52:38.360 --> 01:52:40.360]  your trends forecast on the economy
[01:52:40.360 --> 01:52:42.360]  investment banker it's going to get nasty
[01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.360]  by land barbed wire
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:46.360]  that's CNBC
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:48.360]  here's the Wall Street Journal headline
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.360]  tax hikes and the 2011
[01:52:50.360 --> 01:52:52.360]  economic collapse
[01:52:52.360 --> 01:52:54.360]  today's corporate profits reflected income shift in 010
[01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.360]  these profits will tumble next year
[01:52:56.360 --> 01:52:58.360]  proceeded most likely
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.360]  by the stock market
[01:53:00.360 --> 01:53:02.360]  and North comes in the news today Gerald
[01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:04.360]  saying Al Qaeda is going to hit
[01:53:04.360 --> 01:53:06.360]  we've got to put army on the streets
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:08.360]  yeah well it is
[01:53:08.360 --> 01:53:10.360]  collapsing and there's nothing that they could do to stop it
[01:53:10.360 --> 01:53:12.360]  we saw what's going on in Europe
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.360]  with the
[01:53:14.360 --> 01:53:16.360]  Greek tragedy
[01:53:16.360 --> 01:53:18.360]  the trillion dollars
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:20.360]  that they just spent to help bail out
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:22.360]  Greece, Spain, Portugal,
[01:53:22.360 --> 01:53:24.360]  Italy and others
[01:53:24.360 --> 01:53:26.360]  and then we heard Angela Merkel
[01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:28.360]  the Chancellor of Germany say
[01:53:28.360 --> 01:53:30.360]  that this is only a temporary measure
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:32.360]  it's not going to fix the problem
[01:53:32.360 --> 01:53:34.360]  of course it's not
[01:53:34.360 --> 01:53:36.360]  you don't
[01:53:36.360 --> 01:53:38.360]  put on more debt
[01:53:38.360 --> 01:53:40.360]  on top of old debt
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:42.360]  to revive an economy
[01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:44.360]  and then plus putting austerity
[01:53:44.360 --> 01:53:46.360]  measures into place
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:48.360]  so we're looking at the collapse
[01:53:48.360 --> 01:53:50.360]  of the crash of 2010
[01:53:50.360 --> 01:53:52.360]  it's going to happen before
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:54.360]  the clock strikes 2011
[01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:56.360]  let's look at the facts Alex
[01:53:56.360 --> 01:53:58.360]  as you mentioned
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:00.360]  we said that in 2010 the stimulus
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:02.360]  money would start to run out
[01:54:02.360 --> 01:54:04.360]  last week we saw the unemployment
[01:54:04.360 --> 01:54:06.360]  numbers come in
[01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:08.360]  they expected 150,000
[01:54:08.360 --> 01:54:10.360]  to 160,000
[01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:12.360]  jobs to be created
[01:54:12.360 --> 01:54:14.360]  in the private sector
[01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:16.360]  41,000 were created
[01:54:16.360 --> 01:54:18.360]  out of 95
[01:54:18.360 --> 01:54:20.360]  95%
[01:54:20.360 --> 01:54:22.360]  of all the jobs
[01:54:22.360 --> 01:54:24.360]  created in May
[01:54:24.360 --> 01:54:26.360]  were census workers
[01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:28.360]  temporary jobs
[01:54:28.360 --> 01:54:30.360]  and to interrupt Gerald that's even using rigged
[01:54:30.360 --> 01:54:32.360]  numbers we learned
[01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:34.360]  100 million people are fired
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:36.360]  and hired each month in the census
[01:54:36.360 --> 01:54:38.360]  and then counted as new jobs
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:40.360]  so even with cooked books
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:42.360]  95% are government
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:44.360]  right and then they're going to be gone
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:46.360]  by the end of the summer
[01:54:46.360 --> 01:54:48.360]  then why
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:50.360]  and I think what you're saying is
[01:54:50.360 --> 01:54:52.360]  what we're saying and that is
[01:54:52.360 --> 01:54:54.360]  when all else fails
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:56.360]  they lead you to war
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:58.360]  and just as we're seeing
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:00.360]  the ineptitude
[01:55:00.360 --> 01:55:02.360]  government by dealing with this tragedy
[01:55:02.360 --> 01:55:04.360]  in the Gulf with the oil spill
[01:55:04.360 --> 01:55:06.360]  just as we saw
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.360]  their Katrina quality
[01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:10.360]  rescue skills
[01:55:10.360 --> 01:55:12.360]  just as they keep fighting
[01:55:12.360 --> 01:55:14.360]  losing wars on drugs
[01:55:14.360 --> 01:55:16.360]  just as they fail
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:18.360]  to improve the education system
[01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:20.360]  with leaving no child left behind
[01:55:20.360 --> 01:55:22.360]  or any other scheme
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:24.360]  just as they lose
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:26.360]  with health care reform
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:28.360]  just as they lose
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:30.360]  with financial reform
[01:55:30.360 --> 01:55:32.360]  the military
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:34.360]  are losers too
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:36.360]  this week we lost what
[01:55:36.360 --> 01:55:38.360]  17 US troops
[01:55:38.360 --> 01:55:40.360]  in Afghanistan
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:42.360]  in a losing war
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:44.360]  that's costing hundreds of billions
[01:55:44.360 --> 01:55:46.360]  that's going to cost more
[01:55:46.360 --> 01:55:48.360]  lost lives
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:50.360]  and that's going to be a losing war at the end
[01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.360]  so to divert
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:54.360]  our attention
[01:55:54.360 --> 01:55:56.360]  Iran looks like the next war
[01:55:56.360 --> 01:55:58.360]  that they will start and lose
[01:55:58.360 --> 01:56:00.360]  so that they can't admit
[01:56:00.360 --> 01:56:02.360]  to their other failures
[01:56:04.360 --> 01:56:06.360]  Gerald the CIA as you know
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:08.360]  two weeks ago bragged to the Washington Post
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:10.360]  that they had put out fake
[01:56:10.360 --> 01:56:12.360]  bin Laden video
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:14.360]  so that's now confirmed we already knew that but now it's admitted
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:16.360]  now they've got
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.360]  known Israeli propaganda
[01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:20.360]  front saying that
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.360]  bin Laden is in Iran
[01:56:22.360 --> 01:56:24.360]  with no proof
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:26.360]  they're just saying this
[01:56:26.360 --> 01:56:28.360]  right on time
[01:56:28.360 --> 01:56:30.360]  for world war three with Iran
[01:56:30.360 --> 01:56:32.360]  yes
[01:56:32.360 --> 01:56:34.360]  this whole spring
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.360]  trends journal is the great war
[01:56:36.360 --> 01:56:38.360]  that the United States
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.360]  and our quote allies
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:42.360]  are leading us to
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:44.360]  look a couple of weeks ago
[01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.360]  we saw the German
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:48.360]  president resign
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.360]  and why did he resign
[01:56:50.360 --> 01:56:52.360]  he admitted why they're
[01:56:52.360 --> 01:56:54.360]  in Afghanistan
[01:56:54.360 --> 01:56:56.360]  and they're going from baby steps
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:56:58.360]  to goose steps
[01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:00.360]  stay there stay there let's come back with the great war
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:02.360]  with Gerald Salente and he's saying
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:04.360]  he sees the total meltdown this year
[01:57:04.360 --> 01:57:06.360]  so that's less than six months
[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:08.360]  stay with us
[01:57:08.360 --> 01:57:10.360]  this is vital info
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:20.360]  by the way in the last 30 minutes
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:22.360]  of the show today I'm going to go through
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:24.360]  the Chris Matthews hit piece because this
[01:57:24.360 --> 01:57:26.360]  is a new level in demonization
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:28.360]  propaganda of Rand Paul myself
[01:57:28.360 --> 01:57:30.360]  and others I may have to go into overdrive
[01:57:30.360 --> 01:57:32.360]  the end of the show just for president planet
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:34.360]  dot tv viewers and internet info
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.360]  wars dot com listeners because that information
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:38.360]  is so important but we'll probably have time to cover it
[01:57:38.360 --> 01:57:40.360]  during regular broadcast time the last 30
[01:57:40.360 --> 01:57:42.360]  minutes after Gerald Salente leaves
[01:57:42.360 --> 01:57:44.360]  us before we go back to Gerald Salente
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:46.360]  and his incredibly valuable
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.360]  crystal ball level
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.360]  analysis

[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:54.360]  is falling apart and we're trying to expand here
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:56.360]  you know we we're getting millions
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:57:58.360]  of millions of visitors a week millions of listeners
[01:57:58.360 --> 01:58:00.360]  a week just on the internet I'm going to be quite honest
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:02.360]  with you it's very costly bandwidth wise

[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:10.360]  the radio show we're self-funded
[01:58:10.360 --> 01:58:12.360]  through radio sponsorship
[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.360]  and through the sales of books videos and
[01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:16.360]  t-shirts and ball caps and
[01:58:16.360 --> 01:58:18.360]  everything we do is about getting the word out

[01:58:34.360 --> 01:58:36.360]  and you support us when you get police state
[01:58:36.360 --> 01:58:38.360]  for the rise of FEMA you'll get a film that can
[01:58:38.360 --> 01:58:40.360]  wake people up about the police state takeover
[01:58:40.360 --> 01:58:42.360]  and how illegal it is when you get a film like
[01:58:42.360 --> 01:58:44.360]  endgame blueprint for global enslavement
[01:58:44.360 --> 01:58:46.360]  the Bilderberg group and what their master plan is
[01:58:46.360 --> 01:58:48.360]  same thing with invisible empire

[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.360]  I never intended to be as successful as I

[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:18.360]  documentaries let's go back to Gerald
[02:00:18.360 --> 02:00:20.360]  Salente but speaking of solutions
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:22.360]  you know I I think
[02:00:22.360 --> 02:00:24.360]  evergreen is the name of the game
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:26.360]  in really convincing people
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:28.360]  when somebody sees a film
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:30.360]  I made like road to tyranny
[02:00:30.360 --> 02:00:32.360]  eight years ago and everything in it came
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.360]  true I found
[02:00:34.360 --> 02:00:36.360]  my older films are even more effective than my
[02:00:36.360 --> 02:00:38.360]  new one sometimes because people can go this guy
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:40.360]  how do you how do you know this eight years ago
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:42.360]  they can watch my first film a thirteen years ago
[02:00:42.360 --> 02:00:44.360]  America destroyed by design
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:46.360]  and they say how did this guy know this it's the
[02:00:46.360 --> 02:00:48.360]  same thing with the trends journal you know
[02:00:48.360 --> 02:00:50.360]  it's great to get the latest trends journal
[02:00:50.360 --> 02:00:52.360]  which is important to get on how
[02:00:52.360 --> 02:00:54.360]  they're trying to start a war and how they're going
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:56.360]  to totally implode the economy soon
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:00:58.360]  but it's also good to get back
[02:00:58.360 --> 02:01:00.360]  journals so so tell folks how they get a
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:02.360]  subscription to the latest journal but how
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:04.360]  do they get back journals
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.360]  so they can really get an understanding
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:08.360]  of how important
[02:01:08.360 --> 02:01:10.360]  your view of the world is Gerald Salente
[02:01:10.360 --> 02:01:12.360]  well our website they could go to
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:14.360]  trendsjournal.com
[02:01:14.360 --> 02:01:16.360]  and just request the back trends journals and we sent
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:18.360]  them to you it's as simple as that
[02:01:18.360 --> 02:01:20.360]  awesome what are some key subscribe
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:22.360]  what are some key journals from the past
[02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:24.360]  that that that you would
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:26.360]  recommend for people to order well you know
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:28.360]  one of them in
[02:01:28.360 --> 02:01:30.360]  2004 I came
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:32.360]  out and said that in
[02:01:32.360 --> 02:01:34.360]  2007
[02:01:34.360 --> 02:01:36.360]  we would enter quote the great
[02:01:36.360 --> 02:01:38.360]  recession so we
[02:01:38.360 --> 02:01:40.360]  back then and we also
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:42.360]  saw back in 2001
[02:01:42.360 --> 02:01:44.360]  we knew that
[02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:46.360]  gold prices would go to
[02:01:46.360 --> 02:01:48.360]  record highs
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:50.360]  and we call the bottom at $275
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:52.360]  an ounce
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:54.360]  it's very simple to see and that
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:56.360]  was it was by
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.360]  knowing that they would begin to
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:00.360]  lower interest rates to 46
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.360]  year lows so you
[02:02:02.360 --> 02:02:04.360]  can't keep printing this digital money
[02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:06.360]  not worth the paper it's not printed
[02:02:06.360 --> 02:02:08.360]  on without ruining the economy
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:10.360]  and the other ones of course
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:12.360]  we forecast terrorism
[02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:14.360]  back in my book Trends 2000
[02:02:14.360 --> 02:02:16.360]  back in 1997
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:18.360]  you could see these trends
[02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:20.360]  coming but people are they want
[02:02:20.360 --> 02:02:22.360]  to live in denial Alex
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.360]  but not anymore more
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:26.360]  and more people want the truth
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:28.360]  they want the facts the motto
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:30.360]  by the way of the trends
[02:02:30.360 --> 02:02:32.360]  research institute is think for yourself
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.360]  I don't tell people what to
[02:02:34.360 --> 02:02:36.360]  believe and nobody tells me what
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:38.360]  and that was your dad that taught you think
[02:02:38.360 --> 02:02:40.360]  for yourself I mean my father
[02:02:40.360 --> 02:02:42.360]  I mean he almost gave me the same statements about
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:44.360]  don't be a parent think for yourself
[02:02:44.360 --> 02:02:46.360]  there's an agenda in the media
[02:02:46.360 --> 02:02:48.360]  you know our government supposed to be
[02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.360]  small historically governments are
[02:02:50.360 --> 02:02:52.360]  destructive now that scene is extremist
[02:02:52.360 --> 02:02:54.360]  by Chris Matthews but that's
[02:02:54.360 --> 02:02:56.360]  Thomas Jefferson that's
[02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:58.360]  a scenic American
[02:02:58.360 --> 02:03:00.360]  you know don't get into debt work hard
[02:03:00.360 --> 02:03:02.360]  only trust your family always
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.360]  stick up for your family that is
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:06.360]  demonized today but that's what made this
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:08.360]  country great I mean who is Chris
[02:03:08.360 --> 02:03:10.360]  Matthews what has this guy ever
[02:03:10.360 --> 02:03:12.360]  done was he a PR
[02:03:12.360 --> 02:03:14.360]  guy for
[02:03:14.360 --> 02:03:16.360]  congressman or a senator or something
[02:03:16.360 --> 02:03:18.360]  yeah before this I mean
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.360]  there's nothing Tim russin
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:22.360]  everybody's to bow down to him another
[02:03:22.360 --> 02:03:24.360]  PR flag that's
[02:03:24.360 --> 02:03:26.360]  all they are they're all
[02:03:26.360 --> 02:03:28.360]  yes men is not
[02:03:28.360 --> 02:03:30.360]  a man among them
[02:03:30.360 --> 02:03:32.360]  they all work in the
[02:03:32.360 --> 02:03:34.360]  Washington Beltway
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:36.360]  circle jerk
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:38.360]  none of them stands up and
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:40.360]  stands out even this guy
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.360]  Bill Mayer who
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.360]  oh you know he's a wise guy
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.360]  this or that I remember
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:48.360]  when he retracted his statement
[02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:50.360]  when he said the one thing
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:52.360]  you couldn't call the terrorists
[02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:54.360]  on 9 11 were cowards
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:56.360]  they're cowards
[02:03:56.360 --> 02:03:58.360]  the paycheck comes first
[02:03:58.360 --> 02:04:00.360]  there's not a man
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:02.360]  among them there's not a
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:04.360]  man in the White House
[02:04:04.360 --> 02:04:06.360]  there never has been in my
[02:04:06.360 --> 02:04:08.360]  lifetime other than Eisenhower
[02:04:08.360 --> 02:04:10.360]  well
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:12.360]  I want to get into the war and
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360]  when you see the economy imploding
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:16.360]  in more detail that's in the current
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:18.360]  trans forecast journal but
[02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.360]  before we do that we were talking during the break
[02:04:20.360 --> 02:04:22.360]  about how Chris Matthews on a
[02:04:22.360 --> 02:04:24.360]  best night has 500,000 viewers
[02:04:24.360 --> 02:04:26.360]  and how medium size
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.360]  syndicated shows like this one have
[02:04:28.360 --> 02:04:30.360]  millions several million
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:32.360]  conservatively about a million more each week on
[02:04:32.360 --> 02:04:34.360]  about 3 million total Chris Matthews
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:36.360]  is a legend in his own mind but because there's
[02:04:36.360 --> 02:04:38.360]  a teleprompter because there's a fancy
[02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:40.360]  suit there's a bunch of reporters
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:42.360]  still some people
[02:04:42.360 --> 02:04:44.360]  watching it think it has all this
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.360]  gravitas and authority
[02:04:46.360 --> 02:04:48.360]  but that illusion is now dying
[02:04:48.360 --> 02:04:50.360]  but Chris Matthews and others still
[02:04:50.360 --> 02:04:52.360]  think their propaganda is
[02:04:52.360 --> 02:04:54.360]  working and that's a big deal that
[02:04:54.360 --> 02:04:56.360]  whoever they attack suddenly
[02:04:56.360 --> 02:04:58.360]  goes up in the polls I mean
[02:04:58.360 --> 02:05:00.360]  don't these delusional monkeys
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.360]  get and understand that their
[02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:04.360]  free ride lying to people
[02:05:04.360 --> 02:05:06.360]  and bamboozling and scamming
[02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:08.360]  and hoodwinking is coming to an
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:10.360]  end?
[02:05:10.360 --> 02:05:12.360]  not until they get fired and the ratings
[02:05:12.360 --> 02:05:14.360]  keeps slipping look what's happened to
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:16.360]  CNN you know I've just
[02:05:16.360 --> 02:05:18.360]  come up with a new pledge
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:20.360]  I'm not going on anymore
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.360]  these shows anymore I'm very selective
[02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:24.360]  and if any of them want to do it they could
[02:05:24.360 --> 02:05:26.360]  come over to my place and
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:28.360]  they could interview me and they're not going to
[02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:30.360]  edit it we're going to do it live
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:32.360]  because I know the game I've been around
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:34.360]  a long time when you're in
[02:05:34.360 --> 02:05:36.360]  charge of the controls
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:38.360]  like they are you can make it look like
[02:05:38.360 --> 02:05:40.360]  anything so why should I
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:42.360]  give my valuable time
[02:05:42.360 --> 02:05:44.360]  up to them what have they
[02:05:44.360 --> 02:05:46.360]  ever accomplished
[02:05:46.360 --> 02:05:48.360]  what have they ever done
[02:05:48.360 --> 02:05:50.360]  their broadcast blow hearts
[02:05:50.360 --> 02:05:52.360]  and suck ups
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:54.360]  to the political system
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:56.360]  so why should I go on their
[02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:58.360]  shows to boost their ratings
[02:05:58.360 --> 02:06:00.360]  well yeah that's the headlines
[02:06:00.360 --> 02:06:02.360]  CNN has lost more than half
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:04.360]  its viewers in one year
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:06.360]  they lost half their viewers the year before that
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:08.360]  I mean they're going to be down to
[02:06:08.360 --> 02:06:10.360]  50,000 viewers on their lowest show
[02:06:10.360 --> 02:06:12.360]  200,000 on their biggest
[02:06:12.360 --> 02:06:14.360]  give the trend continues in six months
[02:06:14.360 --> 02:06:16.360]  according to the Associated Press
[02:06:16.360 --> 02:06:18.360]  their top show Larry King has
[02:06:18.360 --> 02:06:20.360]  a million by the way it's going to be a hot show tonight
[02:06:20.360 --> 02:06:22.360]  I talked to Ventura a few days ago
[02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:24.360]  and I can now talk about he's on there with Oliver Stone
[02:06:24.360 --> 02:06:26.360]  talking about New World Order
[02:06:26.360 --> 02:06:28.360]  so now they're forced to let
[02:06:28.360 --> 02:06:30.360]  Ventura and Stone on who will actually
[02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.360]  talk about real issues desperately
[02:06:32.360 --> 02:06:34.360]  to keep any viewers so that's actually
[02:06:34.360 --> 02:06:36.360]  smart of Larry King
[02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:38.360]  you mean Larry King is it Larry King
[02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:40.360]  live or Larry King almost dead
[02:06:40.360 --> 02:06:42.360]  I mean come on you know
[02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:44.360]  when are they going to try something new
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:46.360]  they're not going to do anything they don't want it
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:48.360]  I know the inside scoop
[02:06:48.360 --> 02:06:50.360]  they want no one with a personality
[02:06:50.360 --> 02:06:52.360]  their white bread
[02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:54.360]  through and through it hurts
[02:06:54.360 --> 02:06:56.360]  the advertisers
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:58.360]  let's get to the bottom line here
[02:06:58.360 --> 02:07:00.360]  a guy like me I'm bad for business
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:02.360]  I'm telling people don't buy
[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:04.360]  anything you don't need
[02:07:04.360 --> 02:07:06.360]  I'm telling people that you're going to
[02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.360]  keep buying stocks
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:10.360]  in a market like this as they bring
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:12.360]  out all these shills
[02:07:12.360 --> 02:07:14.360]  on CNBC and other places
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:16.360]  saying this is a good
[02:07:16.360 --> 02:07:18.360]  buying opportunity stocks
[02:07:18.360 --> 02:07:20.360]  are at a low yeah
[02:07:20.360 --> 02:07:22.360]  stocks are at a low they're at a
[02:07:22.360 --> 02:07:24.360]  1999 low remember
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:26.360]  they told you Alex
[02:07:26.360 --> 02:07:28.360]  you know you have to stay in it for the long
[02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.360]  term it wasn't the
[02:07:30.360 --> 02:07:32.360]  NASDAQ in
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:34.360]  2000 at 5000
[02:07:34.360 --> 02:07:36.360]  and now it's
[02:07:36.360 --> 02:07:38.360]  watching 2000
[02:07:38.360 --> 02:07:40.360]  what is the long term
[02:07:40.360 --> 02:07:42.360]  a couple of generations
[02:07:42.360 --> 02:07:44.360]  oh and how about those wonderful
[02:07:44.360 --> 02:07:46.360]  legacy stocks like
[02:07:46.360 --> 02:07:48.360]  Lehman Brothers and General Motors
[02:07:48.360 --> 02:07:50.360]  no they don't want me on
[02:07:50.360 --> 02:07:52.360]  I'm not going on anymore
[02:07:52.360 --> 02:07:54.360]  I'm telling you I'm very selective
[02:07:54.360 --> 02:07:56.360]  I get I get requests
[02:07:56.360 --> 02:07:58.360]  I turn them down I don't need them
[02:07:58.360 --> 02:08:00.360]  well I've noticed I only see you
[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:02.360]  you know I need them I notice the
[02:08:02.360 --> 02:08:04.360]  YouTube's I see of
[02:08:04.360 --> 02:08:06.360]  because I don't watch TV I end up watching
[02:08:06.360 --> 02:08:08.360]  aggregate clips I don't
[02:08:08.360 --> 02:08:10.360]  watch a lot of TV to be accurate but
[02:08:10.360 --> 02:08:12.360]  I notice I only see you on Fox mainly
[02:08:12.360 --> 02:08:14.360]  when it's live
[02:08:14.360 --> 02:08:16.360]  yes exactly I won't go on any
[02:08:16.360 --> 02:08:18.360]  tape shows because they do what they do
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.360]  to you they sandbag you
[02:08:20.360 --> 02:08:22.360]  you could do anything
[02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:24.360]  with editing and again these
[02:08:24.360 --> 02:08:26.360]  aren't men there's not a man
[02:08:26.360 --> 02:08:28.360]  among them they're big
[02:08:28.360 --> 02:08:30.360]  mouths when they're in their
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:32.360]  little power bases just like
[02:08:32.360 --> 02:08:34.360]  politicians the red
[02:08:34.360 --> 02:08:36.360]  carpet crowd you know they
[02:08:36.360 --> 02:08:38.360]  show up in these huge
[02:08:38.360 --> 02:08:40.360]  airplanes you know they salute
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:42.360]  they walk down the gang
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:44.360]  plank a red carpet comes out
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:46.360]  they strike up the band and they have
[02:08:46.360 --> 02:08:48.360]  a parade and they're there
[02:08:48.360 --> 02:08:50.360]  they have all their guards around
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:52.360]  them and the crowd is
[02:08:52.360 --> 02:08:54.360]  you know a hundred yards away
[02:08:54.360 --> 02:08:56.360]  let's talk man to man over here
[02:08:56.360 --> 02:08:58.360]  you'll never get one of them
[02:08:58.360 --> 02:09:00.360]  do it because they're little
[02:09:00.360 --> 02:09:02.360]  babies they're only tough
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:04.360]  in their own arena
[02:09:04.360 --> 02:09:06.360]  if they want to come over and talk
[02:09:06.360 --> 02:09:08.360]  to me man to man we could have
[02:09:08.360 --> 02:09:10.360]  a man to man conversation
[02:09:10.360 --> 02:09:12.360]  they'll never do it there's not a
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:14.360]  man among them they're
[02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.360]  political suck ups all
[02:09:16.360 --> 02:09:18.360]  of them well when you have
[02:09:18.360 --> 02:09:20.360]  a bunch of cowards running your society
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:22.360]  who say yes to everything the worst
[02:09:22.360 --> 02:09:24.360]  is going to gravitate to the top and they're going
[02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:26.360]  to become disconnected from reality
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:28.360]  and they're going to destroy their own tyranny
[02:09:28.360 --> 02:09:30.360]  the good news is they've created such a
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:32.360]  tsunami of robbing and looting
[02:09:32.360 --> 02:09:34.360]  and stealing that Merkel two weeks
[02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:36.360]  ago had to put her own blocks in
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:38.360]  to stop the Wall
[02:09:38.360 --> 02:09:40.360]  Street and London banks bringing Germany
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:42.360]  down and that brings me back
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:44.360]  to you got cut off of the last break
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:46.360]  and we went off into other subjects because I
[02:09:46.360 --> 02:09:48.360]  went there Gerald you're talking about
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:50.360]  war sooner rather than later
[02:09:50.360 --> 02:09:52.360]  you're saying you believe
[02:09:52.360 --> 02:09:54.360]  the full collapse will come
[02:09:54.360 --> 02:09:56.360]  by the end of 2010
[02:09:56.360 --> 02:09:58.360]  give us the full breakdown
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:00.360]  let's go through this
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:02.360]  the crash of 2010 is happening
[02:10:02.360 --> 02:10:04.360]  we saw it with the Dow taking a dive
[02:10:04.360 --> 02:10:06.360]  and continue to do so as the
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:08.360]  rest of the world equity markets
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:10.360]  the United States has spent lent and
[02:10:10.360 --> 02:10:12.360]  guaranteed 13 trillion
[02:10:12.360 --> 02:10:14.360]  dollars to bail out their system
[02:10:14.360 --> 02:10:16.360]  including bailing out the commercial real
[02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:18.360]  estate sector this has gone on
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:20.360]  worldwide the whole
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:22.360]  EU has done it with their cheap money
[02:10:22.360 --> 02:10:24.360]  Australia the UK
[02:10:24.360 --> 02:10:26.360]  Japan
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:28.360]  South Korea and China of course
[02:10:28.360 --> 02:10:30.360]  but China could afford to do it
[02:10:30.360 --> 02:10:32.360]  because they have surpluses
[02:10:32.360 --> 02:10:34.360]  it's all running out now
[02:10:34.360 --> 02:10:36.360]  so now we're going to start seeing the
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:38.360]  collapse that's why
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:40.360]  gold prices are what now
[02:10:40.360 --> 02:10:42.360]  what $1,200
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:44.360]  about $40
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:46.360]  $30 world record
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:48.360]  world record here
[02:10:48.360 --> 02:10:50.360]  and the Europeans know the deal and they're
[02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:52.360]  going to keep buying more of it
[02:10:52.360 --> 02:10:54.360]  and then we're going to see more talk
[02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:56.360]  about war
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.360]  and that's how they divert the attention
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:00.360]  history is only repeating itself
[02:11:00.360 --> 02:11:02.360]  the same thing happened in the late 1920s
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:04.360]  markets crash
[02:11:04.360 --> 02:11:06.360]  depressions, recessions set in
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:08.360]  social unrest builds
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:10.360]  and what do they do?
[02:11:10.360 --> 02:11:12.360]  they take you to war
[02:11:12.360 --> 02:11:14.360]  we have to have nuclear war
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:16.360]  they told us forget about bin Laden
[02:11:16.360 --> 02:11:18.360]  for five years but now he's in Iran
[02:11:18.360 --> 02:11:20.360]  they said so
[02:11:20.360 --> 02:11:22.360]  nuclear war Gerald bin Laden
[02:11:22.360 --> 02:11:24.360]  and how about that side I'm just saying
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:26.360]  remember his weapons of mass destruction
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:28.360]  and ties to Al Qaeda
[02:11:28.360 --> 02:11:30.360]  and remember the Gulf of
[02:11:30.360 --> 02:11:32.360]  Tom Kinton, remember the main
[02:11:32.360 --> 02:11:34.360]  but bin Laden was on the main
[02:11:34.360 --> 02:11:36.360]  bin Laden was on the main
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:38.360]  in Havana Harbor in 1898
[02:11:38.360 --> 02:11:40.360]  Gerald come on
[02:11:40.360 --> 02:11:42.360]  there are no conspiracy theories
[02:11:42.360 --> 02:11:44.360]  and you know you were talking before
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:46.360]  we were talking about these whims
[02:11:46.360 --> 02:11:48.360]  look at Obama the cheap trick with him
[02:11:48.360 --> 02:11:50.360]  going out there I'm going to kick ass
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:52.360]  yeah he was going to
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:54.360]  throw sharp elbows on the
[02:11:54.360 --> 02:11:56.360]  the word on him is
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:58.360]  all he does is hang around in bath houses
[02:11:58.360 --> 02:12:00.360]  so I mean this whole thing
[02:12:00.360 --> 02:12:02.360]  is a disgusting spectacle
[02:12:02.360 --> 02:12:04.360]  and the people need to realize
[02:12:04.360 --> 02:12:06.360]  who's in control
[02:12:06.360 --> 02:12:08.360]  remember the guys in high school and college
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:10.360]  that wanted to be the class
[02:12:10.360 --> 02:12:12.360]  presidents and the head of the
[02:12:12.360 --> 02:12:14.360]  student council
[02:12:14.360 --> 02:12:16.360]  the guys that you know were suck ups
[02:12:16.360 --> 02:12:18.360]  that were brown nosers
[02:12:18.360 --> 02:12:20.360]  that were never sincere
[02:12:20.360 --> 02:12:22.360]  glad handers and only
[02:12:22.360 --> 02:12:24.360]  out for themselves
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:26.360]  the people that you couldn't stand
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.360]  no I remember being about 18
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:30.360]  and finally figuring out there's a lot of manipulative
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:32.360]  liars out there who assess you like
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:34.360]  a predator and then manipulate
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:36.360]  but they're always cowards
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:38.360]  you know at their bottom bottom
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:40.360]  card exactly and these
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:42.360]  are now our Senators
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:44.360]  our Secretaries of this
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:46.360]  and that our Presidents
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:48.360]  that's all they are
[02:12:48.360 --> 02:12:50.360]  the same people we couldn't
[02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:52.360]  stand in high school and college
[02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:54.360]  are now telling us what
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:12:56.360]  to do and the reason they get
[02:12:56.360 --> 02:12:58.360]  away with it again it's the
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:00.360]  red carpet crowd
[02:13:00.360 --> 02:13:02.360]  it's the pump that they keep
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:04.360]  showing the pump
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:06.360]  I mean you talk about going into Iran
[02:13:06.360 --> 02:13:08.360]  how do you see that unfolding
[02:13:08.360 --> 02:13:10.360]  A and then B you did say
[02:13:10.360 --> 02:13:12.360]  the stimulus would run out in 2010
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:14.360]  you called it the
[02:13:14.360 --> 02:13:16.360]  OA situation 2-3 years before
[02:13:16.360 --> 02:13:18.360]  you called that accurately
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:20.360]  and some of the other great economists we've had on have been
[02:13:20.360 --> 02:13:22.360]  accurate so that's what's scary is
[02:13:22.360 --> 02:13:24.360]  that all the experts are agreeing
[02:13:24.360 --> 02:13:26.360]  and you can see and now the mainstream
[02:13:26.360 --> 02:13:28.360]  media is finally admitting an implosion
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:30.360]  is accelerating
[02:13:30.360 --> 02:13:32.360]  and so you're saying
[02:13:32.360 --> 02:13:34.360]  you see this really happening
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:36.360]  by the end of this year clearly the economy
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:38.360]  is already on its back like a turtle
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:40.360]  that can't get up but describe that
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:42.360]  in detail how you see it unfolding
[02:13:42.360 --> 02:13:44.360]  Alright first on the war
[02:13:44.360 --> 02:13:46.360]  Iran is talking about now
[02:13:46.360 --> 02:13:48.360]  bringing the ship into
[02:13:48.360 --> 02:13:50.360]  Gaza of relief
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:52.360]  goods that could be a
[02:13:52.360 --> 02:13:54.360]  conflict right there
[02:13:54.360 --> 02:13:56.360]  Israel is on the edge continually
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:13:58.360]  looking for an excuse as
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:00.360]  is being reported to
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:02.360]  invade Iran to knock out their
[02:14:02.360 --> 02:14:04.360]  nuclear capabilities
[02:14:04.360 --> 02:14:06.360]  at any level the United States
[02:14:06.360 --> 02:14:08.360]  keeps demonizing
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:10.360]  Iran continually
[02:14:10.360 --> 02:14:12.360]  and so we see something
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:14.360]  happening and as a flash point
[02:14:14.360 --> 02:14:16.360]  and of course it'll be
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:18.360]  a false flag we will put
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:20.360]  no credence in it at all
[02:14:20.360 --> 02:14:22.360]  if there's an attack against Iran
[02:14:22.360 --> 02:14:24.360]  that's the worst scenario and that's the one
[02:14:24.360 --> 02:14:26.360]  we think is going to unfold
[02:14:26.360 --> 02:14:28.360]  on the economic level
[02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:30.360]  there are a million wild cards out there
[02:14:30.360 --> 02:14:32.360]  Europe looks like
[02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:34.360]  the best one now
[02:14:34.360 --> 02:14:36.360]  but there could be a huge collapse
[02:14:36.360 --> 02:14:38.360]  every Saturday morning
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:40.360]  you pick up the newspaper
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:42.360]  and buried in on the bottom
[02:14:42.360 --> 02:14:44.360]  somewhere is another
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:46.360]  five banks that fail
[02:14:46.360 --> 02:14:48.360]  stay there we're going to come back
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:50.360]  with a segment on the economy
[02:14:50.360 --> 02:14:52.360]  with Gerald Salente then your phone calls
[02:14:52.360 --> 02:14:54.360]  are coming up for the next 30 minutes
[02:14:54.360 --> 02:14:56.360]  he's been gracious to spend this much time with us
[02:14:56.360 --> 02:14:58.360]  Gerald Salente and we'll also
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:00.360]  give you his website as well
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:02.360]  when we come back of course we're watching on
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:04.360]  prisonplanet.tv you can see it right behind him
[02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:06.360]  but it's just such valuable
[02:15:06.360 --> 02:15:08.360]  information Gerald Salente
[02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.360]  I'm Alex Jones with infowars.com
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:18.360]  by the way
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:20.360]  he is part of two of my films
[02:15:20.360 --> 02:15:22.360]  I appreciate him appearing in them
[02:15:22.360 --> 02:15:24.360]  one of the key analysts we have in
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:26.360]  fall of the republic and the Obama deception
[02:15:26.360 --> 02:15:28.360]  both of these films
[02:15:28.360 --> 02:15:30.360]  break down who the globalist are
[02:15:30.360 --> 02:15:32.360]  how they set up the banking scam
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:34.360]  and what their plan is going to be
[02:15:34.360 --> 02:15:36.360]  into this year and the next
[02:15:36.360 --> 02:15:38.360]  so this is kind of a video trans forecast
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:40.360]  hope you'll get them both at infowars.com
[02:15:40.360 --> 02:15:42.360]  and the new film we just released
[02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:44.360]  Invisible Empire a new world order
[02:15:44.360 --> 02:15:46.360]  defined so important knowledge
[02:15:46.360 --> 02:15:48.360]  is power and it's also important
[02:15:48.360 --> 02:15:50.360]  in these rough times to support
[02:15:50.360 --> 02:15:52.360]  the alternative media that's a separate subject
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:54.360]  I'm going to bring up with Gerald the next hour
[02:15:54.360 --> 02:15:56.360]  the open calls everywhere to shut down the internet
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:58.360]  to censor talk radio
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:00.360]  to have government licenses
[02:16:00.360 --> 02:16:02.360]  to be a journalist
[02:16:02.360 --> 02:16:04.360]  I mean the system is in trouble
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:06.360]  when they openly want to shut down free speech
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.360]  but Gerald Salente you were getting into
[02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.360]  opening the paper up 5, 6, 7, 10, 12
[02:16:10.360 --> 02:16:12.360]  depending on the day
[02:16:12.360 --> 02:16:14.360]  every day banks are being shut down
[02:16:14.360 --> 02:16:16.360]  by the federal regulators please continue
[02:16:16.360 --> 02:16:18.360]  yes the federal reserve
[02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:20.360]  is effectively bankrupt
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:22.360]  and what we're saying is that
[02:16:22.360 --> 02:16:24.360]  when there is a terrorist strike
[02:16:24.360 --> 02:16:26.360]  and there will be we're forecasting
[02:16:26.360 --> 02:16:28.360]  one of 9-11 magnitude
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:30.360]  this time they're going to close the banks
[02:16:30.360 --> 02:16:32.360]  the last time they closed Wall Street
[02:16:32.360 --> 02:16:34.360]  but of course the last time in
[02:16:34.360 --> 02:16:36.360]  2001 you know we were getting
[02:16:36.360 --> 02:16:38.360]  over the dot-com bubble bursting
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:40.360]  and the conditions were very bad
[02:16:40.360 --> 02:16:42.360]  but nothing like today
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:44.360]  so they were able to lower interest rates
[02:16:44.360 --> 02:16:46.360]  back then now they're at near zero
[02:16:46.360 --> 02:16:48.360]  I mean in some
[02:16:48.360 --> 02:16:50.360]  I know they're talking about
[02:16:50.360 --> 02:16:52.360]  negative interest rates but it's not going to work
[02:16:52.360 --> 02:16:54.360]  so this time in order to stop the panic
[02:16:54.360 --> 02:16:56.360]  we believe they're going to close the banks
[02:16:56.360 --> 02:16:58.360]  but the point being
[02:16:58.360 --> 02:17:00.360]  is that the banks are already in trouble
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:02.360]  there is not going to be
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:04.360]  a recovery
[02:17:04.360 --> 02:17:06.360]  it does it shows up
[02:17:06.360 --> 02:17:08.360]  in the job numbers
[02:17:08.360 --> 02:17:10.360]  and then you have these
[02:17:10.360 --> 02:17:12.360]  these analysts are saying
[02:17:12.360 --> 02:17:14.360]  well it's a jobless recovery
[02:17:14.360 --> 02:17:16.360]  you have about being almost pregnant as I say
[02:17:16.360 --> 02:17:18.360]  you know there's no such
[02:17:18.360 --> 02:17:20.360]  thing you have to create jobs
[02:17:20.360 --> 02:17:22.360]  with 72% consumer
[02:17:22.360 --> 02:17:24.360]  oriented society
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:26.360]  no jobs
[02:17:26.360 --> 02:17:28.360]  no consumption
[02:17:28.360 --> 02:17:30.360]  and then what we're looking at as I said
[02:17:30.360 --> 02:17:32.360]  as when they can no longer
[02:17:32.360 --> 02:17:34.360]  hide the failures
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:36.360]  they take us to war
[02:17:36.360 --> 02:17:38.360]  and the war looks like it's going to be
[02:17:38.360 --> 02:17:40.360]  at this point with Iran
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:42.360]  and when it does happen
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:44.360]  we don't believe the reasons they give us
[02:17:44.360 --> 02:17:46.360]  will be real
[02:17:46.360 --> 02:17:48.360]  it'll be a false flag
[02:17:48.360 --> 02:17:50.360]  as it was with weapons of mass destruction
[02:17:50.360 --> 02:17:52.360]  and ties to Al Qaeda
[02:17:52.360 --> 02:17:54.360]  and the Gulf of Tonkin
[02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:56.360]  and others
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:58.360]  but in the Gulf of Tonkin in 64
[02:17:58.360 --> 02:18:00.360]  Bin Laden was there
[02:18:00.360 --> 02:18:02.360]  you know that's another question
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:04.360]  why are they getting so arrogant
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:06.360]  to have the CIA in spy talk
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:08.360]  in the Washington Post weekly column
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:10.360]  admit they put out fake Bin Laden videos
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:12.360]  why is Handelbar
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:14.360]  Mustache, Harald Rivera
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:16.360]  talking to the Marine Corps Colonel
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:18.360]  admitting that our government has the troops
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:20.360]  growing the opium
[02:18:20.360 --> 02:18:22.360]  more and more they're going yeah we ship the opium
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:24.360]  yeah we're putting fake videos out
[02:18:24.360 --> 02:18:26.360]  yeah we won't tell you where the trillions in bailout money went
[02:18:26.360 --> 02:18:28.360]  I mean it looks like they've almost
[02:18:28.360 --> 02:18:30.360]  shifted tactics to just like
[02:18:30.360 --> 02:18:32.360]  hiding it in plain view now
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:34.360]  you know as I said before
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:36.360]  you know these aren't the brightest
[02:18:36.360 --> 02:18:38.360]  people they're given too much
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:40.360]  credit they're losers
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:42.360]  again everything
[02:18:42.360 --> 02:18:44.360]  they touch they turn
[02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:46.360]  to rot whether it's education
[02:18:46.360 --> 02:18:48.360]  health care wars
[02:18:48.360 --> 02:18:50.360]  environment you name it
[02:18:50.360 --> 02:18:52.360]  food so yeah they're not the brightest
[02:18:52.360 --> 02:18:54.360]  people and look
[02:18:54.360 --> 02:18:56.360]  the CIA is admitting
[02:18:56.360 --> 02:18:58.360]  that they're waging a war with these predator
[02:18:58.360 --> 02:19:00.360]  drones in Pakistan
[02:19:00.360 --> 02:19:02.360]  since when did the CIA
[02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:04.360]  get into the war business
[02:19:04.360 --> 02:19:06.360]  overtly and since when
[02:19:06.360 --> 02:19:08.360]  is it not against
[02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:10.360]  international law to perform
[02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:12.360]  extrajudicial killings
[02:19:12.360 --> 02:19:14.360]  by killing quote
[02:19:14.360 --> 02:19:16.360]  suspected terrorists
[02:19:16.360 --> 02:19:18.360]  in sovereign countries
[02:19:18.360 --> 02:19:20.360]  by sending drones in
[02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:22.360]  so it's their arrogance
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:24.360]  and also possibly
[02:19:24.360 --> 02:19:26.360]  their ignorance
[02:19:26.360 --> 02:19:28.360]  well Gerald Salente
[02:19:28.360 --> 02:19:30.360]  the trends research
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:32.360]  analyst the founder of trends research is our guest
[02:19:32.360 --> 02:19:34.360]  for another 30 minutes we're going to take
[02:19:34.360 --> 02:19:36.360]  your calls go to twitter questions
[02:19:36.360 --> 02:19:38.360]  and a lot more straight ahead when we begin
[02:19:38.360 --> 02:19:40.360]  the fourth hour
[02:19:40.360 --> 02:19:42.360]  and you know we talk about this
[02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:44.360]  so much I don't want people to get mental fatigue
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:46.360]  when we're discussing depression and wars
[02:19:46.360 --> 02:19:48.360]  because it's already ongoing
[02:19:48.360 --> 02:19:50.360]  it's going to get worse
[02:19:58.360 --> 02:20:00.360]  wow Gerald Salente saying
[02:20:00.360 --> 02:20:02.360]  he thinks they're probably going to stage an attack
[02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:04.360]  of some type as a false flag
[02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:06.360]  to go into Iran
[02:20:06.360 --> 02:20:08.360]  these are the times that try folks
[02:20:08.360 --> 02:20:10.360]  souls this is real
[02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:12.360]  this is happening
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:14.360]  and I catch myself all the time
[02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:16.360]  just kind of getting comfortable with the idea of depression
[02:20:16.360 --> 02:20:18.360]  comfortable with the idea of world war 3
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:20.360]  no
[02:20:20.360 --> 02:20:22.360]  we need to get angry we need to get upset
[02:20:22.360 --> 02:20:24.360]  we need to get involved
[02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:26.360]  and Gerald Salente
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:28.360]  I want to take some calls
[02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:30.360]  but when we come back in the next segment
[02:20:30.360 --> 02:20:32.360]  I want to hear your idea for solutions
[02:20:32.360 --> 02:20:34.360]  9th 10th amendment
[02:20:34.360 --> 02:20:36.360]  we know where the globalists are going
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:38.360]  but how you see the tea party movement
[02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:40.360]  unfolding into the wider
[02:20:40.360 --> 02:20:42.360]  second American revolution
[02:20:42.360 --> 02:20:44.360]  1776 all over again
[02:20:44.360 --> 02:20:46.360]  so that's coming up with Gerald Salente
[02:20:46.360 --> 02:20:48.360]  of Trends Research
[02:20:48.360 --> 02:20:50.360]  Journal
[02:20:50.360 --> 02:20:52.360]  but let's go to Chris in Indiana
[02:20:52.360 --> 02:20:54.360]  first question for Gerald Salente
[02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:56.360]  go ahead Chris
[02:20:56.360 --> 02:20:58.360]  Gerald, Alex, thank you for taking my call
[02:20:58.360 --> 02:21:00.360]  question is
[02:21:00.360 --> 02:21:02.360]  with the oil volcano going on in the Gulf of Mexico
[02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:04.360]  right now
[02:21:04.360 --> 02:21:06.360]  I read an article this morning where the PSI
[02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.360]  coming out of that hole could be
[02:21:08.360 --> 02:21:10.360]  1,000 PSI or greater
[02:21:10.360 --> 02:21:12.360]  and they may not be able to cap it
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:14.360]  can that event
[02:21:14.360 --> 02:21:16.360]  being very catastrophic
[02:21:16.360 --> 02:21:18.360]  with the toxins
[02:21:18.360 --> 02:21:20.360]  the fishing industry getting destroyed
[02:21:20.360 --> 02:21:22.360]  the tourism
[02:21:22.360 --> 02:21:24.360]  can that event cause the collapse to happen
[02:21:24.360 --> 02:21:26.360]  earlier rather than later
[02:21:26.360 --> 02:21:28.360]  in your six month predictions
[02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:30.360]  probably not
[02:21:30.360 --> 02:21:32.360]  it's a terrible event
[02:21:32.360 --> 02:21:34.360]  but there are much bigger
[02:21:34.360 --> 02:21:36.360]  economic issues around it
[02:21:36.360 --> 02:21:38.360]  the other part of that is
[02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:40.360]  to get the people's mind off that
[02:21:40.360 --> 02:21:42.360]  war will do that
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:44.360]  I agree
[02:21:44.360 --> 02:21:46.360]  they're using the oil as a nice distraction
[02:21:46.360 --> 02:21:48.360]  while they're getting their war ready
[02:21:48.360 --> 02:21:50.360]  and it would go back
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:52.360]  to when the oil spill
[02:21:52.360 --> 02:21:54.360]  first began
[02:21:54.360 --> 02:21:56.360]  and then we saw that Times Square
[02:21:56.360 --> 02:21:58.360]  bomber pop up
[02:21:58.360 --> 02:22:00.360]  and the oil went out of the media
[02:22:00.360 --> 02:22:02.360]  and that's what can happen again
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:04.360]  so if there's a terrorist strike
[02:22:04.360 --> 02:22:06.360]  or a war
[02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:08.360]  something of that nature
[02:22:08.360 --> 02:22:10.360]  this thing will be flushed out of the news
[02:22:10.360 --> 02:22:12.360]  very quickly
[02:22:12.360 --> 02:22:14.360]  but the more and more they're losing control of the media
[02:22:14.360 --> 02:22:16.360]  and we'll talk about their attempt at media censorship later
[02:22:16.360 --> 02:22:18.360]  but look at Haiti
[02:22:18.360 --> 02:22:20.360]  200,000 plus dead
[02:22:20.360 --> 02:22:22.360]  thousands, I've seen numbers, thousands dying a week
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:24.360]  the total collapse of society
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:26.360]  you don't hear about Haiti anymore
[02:22:26.360 --> 02:22:28.360]  no, no you don't
[02:22:28.360 --> 02:22:30.360]  and again
[02:22:30.360 --> 02:22:32.360]  this tragedy that's going on in the Gulf
[02:22:32.360 --> 02:22:34.360]  it looks like it's going to continue going on
[02:22:34.360 --> 02:22:36.360]  and the implications
[02:22:36.360 --> 02:22:38.360]  are exactly what the quality said
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:40.360]  are very far reaching
[02:22:40.360 --> 02:22:42.360]  whether it's the feed supplies
[02:22:42.360 --> 02:22:44.360]  the fish
[02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:46.360]  it just keeps going on and on
[02:22:46.360 --> 02:22:48.360]  the fish, the oysters, most of our seafood
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:50.360]  oysters
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:52.360]  and shrimp is coming out of the Gulf
[02:22:52.360 --> 02:22:54.360]  I mean
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:56.360]  the terrorism, I mean this is going to decimate
[02:22:56.360 --> 02:22:58.360]  Florida
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:00.360]  and Louisiana and Mississippi
[02:23:00.360 --> 02:23:02.360]  so the tidal forces
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:04.360]  it's going to go around Florida and up the east coast
[02:23:04.360 --> 02:23:06.360]  and meanwhile
[02:23:06.360 --> 02:23:08.360]  the feds are so tightly controlling this
[02:23:08.360 --> 02:23:10.360]  now we're talking about using nuclear weapons
[02:23:10.360 --> 02:23:12.360]  to stop it, I mean this is insane
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:14.360]  yeah, oh the other part of the food chain
[02:23:14.360 --> 02:23:16.360]  is
[02:23:16.360 --> 02:23:18.360]  the fish meal and all the residue from the fish
[02:23:18.360 --> 02:23:20.360]  that are used
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:22.360]  for feeds
[02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:24.360]  and for fertilizers
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:26.360]  so this thing just keeps going on and on
[02:23:26.360 --> 02:23:28.360]  but again
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:30.360]  we believe there's going to be
[02:23:30.360 --> 02:23:32.360]  a 9-11 magnitude
[02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:34.360]  terror strike before this year is over
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:36.360]  and that
[02:23:36.360 --> 02:23:38.360]  the concept of war
[02:23:38.360 --> 02:23:40.360]  will become more and more of a given
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:42.360]  as we get closer to
[02:23:42.360 --> 02:23:44.360]  financial disaster
[02:23:44.360 --> 02:23:46.360]  and again, just turn on
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:48.360]  the news, look what's going on
[02:23:48.360 --> 02:23:50.360]  with the world equity markets
[02:23:50.360 --> 02:23:52.360]  regardless of all this baloney you're hearing
[02:23:52.360 --> 02:23:54.360]  about being a good buying
[02:23:54.360 --> 02:23:56.360]  opportunity and profit margins
[02:23:56.360 --> 02:23:58.360]  are still very high
[02:23:58.360 --> 02:24:00.360]  the collapse is coming
[02:24:00.360 --> 02:24:02.360]  well said, we're going to come back
[02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:04.360]  and go to Pete in Calgary
[02:24:04.360 --> 02:24:06.360]  Alberta, Mark
[02:24:06.360 --> 02:24:08.360]  in Oregon, Mark in California, Greg in Kansas
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:10.360]  and others, the toll free number to join us is
[02:24:10.360 --> 02:24:12.360]  800-259-9231
[02:24:12.360 --> 02:24:14.360]  we got only about 45 seconds
[02:24:14.360 --> 02:24:16.360]  but what about media censorship Gerald
[02:24:16.360 --> 02:24:18.360]  we're really seeing them start to hype
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:20.360]  that the American way is to shut down free speech
[02:24:20.360 --> 02:24:22.360]  well we heard President Obama say that
[02:24:22.360 --> 02:24:24.360]  in so many words
[02:24:24.360 --> 02:24:27.360]  when he warned about all these other voices out there
[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:29.360]  that you have to be careful about
[02:24:29.360 --> 02:24:31.360]  because you're getting them over the internet
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.360]  and not from the mainstream media
[02:24:34.360 --> 02:24:37.360]  as though they're the ones that you should believe
[02:24:37.360 --> 02:24:39.360]  absolutely, stay there, let's finish up talking about
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:41.360]  the attempt at media censorship that's being
[02:24:41.360 --> 02:24:43.360]  promoted right now and then we'll go to your calls
[02:24:43.360 --> 02:24:45.360]  and a lot more, but Gerald Salente
[02:24:45.360 --> 02:24:47.360]  9-11 magnitude attack
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:49.360]  sometime in the next 6-7 months
[02:24:49.360 --> 02:24:54.360]  we'll be right back, stay with us
[02:24:54.360 --> 02:24:56.360]  oh yeah
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:58.360]  big brother
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:00.360]  mainstream media
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:01.360]  government cover-ups
[02:25:01.360 --> 02:25:02.360]  power number four
[02:25:02.360 --> 02:25:03.360]  answers
[02:25:03.360 --> 02:25:05.360]  well so does he
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:07.360]  he's Alex Jones
[02:25:07.360 --> 02:25:09.360]  on the GCN radio network
[02:25:09.360 --> 02:25:10.360]  and now
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:13.360]  live from Austin, Texas
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:16.360]  Alex Jones
[02:25:16.360 --> 02:25:19.360]  Trends Research, one word, TrendsResearch.com
[02:25:19.360 --> 02:25:23.360]  is the invaluable Trends Research Institute website
[02:25:23.360 --> 02:25:25.360]  and Gerald Salente is with us
[02:25:25.360 --> 02:25:27.360]  until the bottom of the hour
[02:25:27.360 --> 02:25:29.360]  going to your phone calls
[02:25:29.360 --> 02:25:31.360]  think of how un-American it is
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:34.360]  that they have neocon from
[02:25:34.360 --> 02:25:36.360]  and they have
[02:25:36.360 --> 02:25:39.360]  White House officials, Cass Sunstein, Elena Kagan
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:41.360]  in her papers which they've now declared
[02:25:41.360 --> 02:25:43.360]  basically national security on
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:45.360]  or trying to block the full release of
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:46.360]  iPhones we have
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:48.360]  she's saying no second amendment
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:49.360]  no free speech
[02:25:49.360 --> 02:25:52.360]  the state can restrict whatever speech it wants
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:54.360]  if it's in the best interest of the state
[02:25:54.360 --> 02:25:56.360]  sounds like Stalin
[02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.360]  we are the state, we're the people
[02:25:58.360 --> 02:25:59.360]  First Amendment
[02:25:59.360 --> 02:26:01.360]  open talk of taking over talk radio
[02:26:01.360 --> 02:26:03.360]  the internet, the FTC in the news
[02:26:03.360 --> 02:26:05.360]  saying we want to fund
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:07.360]  mainline newspapers and TV
[02:26:07.360 --> 02:26:09.360]  with taxes on the internet
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:11.360]  and iPhones
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:12.360]  Gerald Salente
[02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:14.360]  I mean this is an amazing development
[02:26:14.360 --> 02:26:16.360]  they finally realize they've lost all credibility
[02:26:16.360 --> 02:26:18.360]  so now they're everywhere
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:19.360]  sending up trial balloons
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:21.360]  telling us how American it is
[02:26:21.360 --> 02:26:23.360]  to ban our free speech
[02:26:23.360 --> 02:26:25.360]  this is tyranny
[02:26:25.360 --> 02:26:28.360]  as they keep losing more and more control
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:31.360]  they will exert more and more control
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:32.360]  that's what's going on
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:34.360]  they know they're losing it
[02:26:34.360 --> 02:26:37.360]  as I said and I will say it again
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:40.360]  the merger of state and corporate powers
[02:26:40.360 --> 02:26:42.360]  just as you pointed out
[02:26:42.360 --> 02:26:44.360]  by giving our tax payer money
[02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:47.360]  to whether it's the media or the banks
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:49.360]  or the too big to fails
[02:26:49.360 --> 02:26:51.360]  is called fascism
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:55.360]  and fascism has come to America
[02:26:55.360 --> 02:26:57.360]  they will do anything they can
[02:26:57.360 --> 02:27:00.360]  to stop their loss of power
[02:27:00.360 --> 02:27:03.360]  and they're losing it by the seconds
[02:27:03.360 --> 02:27:05.360]  well it's a criminal buy off
[02:27:05.360 --> 02:27:07.360]  I mean remembering congress and hearings
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:08.360]  just last year
[02:27:08.360 --> 02:27:10.360]  it came out that the democratic party
[02:27:10.360 --> 02:27:12.360]  went and looked at records
[02:27:12.360 --> 02:27:13.360]  and if your Chevy dealership
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:15.360]  one of them was set up in like 1916
[02:27:15.360 --> 02:27:17.360]  in Minnesota in one case was on the news
[02:27:17.360 --> 02:27:19.360]  if you hadn't given money to the democrats
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:21.360]  and you were a republican
[02:27:21.360 --> 02:27:22.360]  to show the infighting
[02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:25.360]  the government took your dealership
[02:27:25.360 --> 02:27:28.360]  literally in one case worth tens of millions of dollars
[02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:30.360]  and gave it to a democrat contributor
[02:27:30.360 --> 02:27:32.360]  I mean this is Chicago mob
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:33.360]  and now it's coming out
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:35.360]  that the White House chief of staff
[02:27:35.360 --> 02:27:37.360]  who we notice is laying low on a manual
[02:27:37.360 --> 02:27:39.360]  that this guy for years as a congressman
[02:27:39.360 --> 02:27:42.360]  had a donor paying for his house in DC
[02:27:42.360 --> 02:27:45.360]  I mean ten years ago you went to prison for that
[02:27:45.360 --> 02:27:48.360]  now they just say hey we're gangsters
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:51.360]  yeah the only people that go to prison
[02:27:51.360 --> 02:27:53.360]  in too hard time are we the people
[02:27:53.360 --> 02:27:56.360]  the word justice is misspelled
[02:27:56.360 --> 02:28:01.360]  is J-U-S-T-U-S
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.360]  just us, not them
[02:28:04.360 --> 02:28:06.360]  the game is rigged again
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:08.360]  it's Harvard Princeton Yale
[02:28:08.360 --> 02:28:10.360]  you mentioned Kagan
[02:28:10.360 --> 02:28:12.360]  what am I a moron
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:14.360]  that the whole supreme court
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:16.360]  is stacked with Harvard and Yale
[02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:19.360]  the head of the fed is from Princeton
[02:28:19.360 --> 02:28:22.360]  they're all better than we are
[02:28:22.360 --> 02:28:25.360]  just us, not them
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:28.360]  we're the only ones that pay the fines
[02:28:28.360 --> 02:28:31.360]  that get hit by the tax collectors
[02:28:31.360 --> 02:28:34.360]  you go through, you have two drinks
[02:28:34.360 --> 02:28:36.360]  two glasses of wine
[02:28:36.360 --> 02:28:38.360]  and they breathalyze
[02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:42.360]  and if you're a half a meter over it
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:46.360]  they'll handcuff you and throw you in jail
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:48.360]  well here's an article right here
[02:28:48.360 --> 02:28:50.360]  I mentioned this and we're going back to calls
[02:28:50.360 --> 02:28:52.360]  but at the start of the show
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:55.360]  Amish farming draws rare government scrutiny
[02:28:55.360 --> 02:28:57.360]  and it says you would think with their simplistic living
[02:28:57.360 --> 02:28:58.360]  they'd be good
[02:28:58.360 --> 02:29:01.360]  but no, the cows defecating
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:03.360]  is seen as pollution now
[02:29:03.360 --> 02:29:06.360]  and it goes on to admit that the feds don't even go inspect
[02:29:06.360 --> 02:29:08.360]  big giant dirty Tyson's facilities
[02:29:08.360 --> 02:29:11.360]  but now they're harassing the little Amish
[02:29:11.360 --> 02:29:13.360]  I see reports every week where they're arresting people
[02:29:13.360 --> 02:29:16.360]  selling eggs and watermelons on the side of the road
[02:29:16.360 --> 02:29:18.360]  with SWAT teams
[02:29:18.360 --> 02:29:21.360]  they're sending SWAT teams to little farmers' houses
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:23.360]  who get caught selling watermelons
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:25.360]  I mean this is the most criminal
[02:29:25.360 --> 02:29:27.360]  out of, I saw an article last year
[02:29:27.360 --> 02:29:29.360]  where a city council
[02:29:29.360 --> 02:29:31.360]  in Oklahoma
[02:29:31.360 --> 02:29:33.360]  is trying to pass a law
[02:29:33.360 --> 02:29:35.360]  that you have to have a license to have a garden
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:37.360]  I mean these people are crooks
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:39.360]  what's happening Alex
[02:29:39.360 --> 02:29:41.360]  is the agricultural industry
[02:29:41.360 --> 02:29:43.360]  is understanding that a lot of people
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:46.360]  are buying family farm food
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:48.360]  and buying local
[02:29:48.360 --> 02:29:50.360]  it's eroding their profit margins
[02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:52.360]  by the way
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:29:55.360]  as we saw with this oil spill disaster
[02:29:55.360 --> 02:29:57.360]  and we continue to see
[02:29:57.360 --> 02:29:59.360]  they call it a revolving door
[02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:01.360]  from business going into government
[02:30:01.360 --> 02:30:03.360]  and government going into business
[02:30:03.360 --> 02:30:05.360]  it's not a revolving door
[02:30:05.360 --> 02:30:07.360]  it's a wide open door
[02:30:07.360 --> 02:30:10.360]  and it's run by the big corporations
[02:30:10.360 --> 02:30:12.360]  it's not revolving
[02:30:12.360 --> 02:30:15.360]  so anytime they see a loss going on
[02:30:15.360 --> 02:30:17.360]  they're going to clamp down
[02:30:17.360 --> 02:30:19.360]  they have the goon squads to do it
[02:30:19.360 --> 02:30:22.360]  they're going to clamp down on the little people
[02:30:22.360 --> 02:30:26.360]  that's why the second American Revolution
[02:30:26.360 --> 02:30:28.360]  is underway
[02:30:28.360 --> 02:30:30.360]  it's incredible
[02:30:30.360 --> 02:30:32.360]  let's go ahead and
[02:30:32.360 --> 02:30:34.360]  take another call here
[02:30:34.360 --> 02:30:36.360]  Pete in Alberta Canada, you're on the air
[02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:38.360]  Hi, thanks gentlemen
[02:30:38.360 --> 02:30:40.360]  some of the other
[02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:42.360]  cosmic forecasters like Arch Crawford
[02:30:42.360 --> 02:30:44.360]  and Cliff High seem to feel strongly
[02:30:44.360 --> 02:30:46.360]  that the collapse is going to start
[02:30:46.360 --> 02:30:48.360]  in July
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:50.360]  and I'm just wondering two things
[02:30:50.360 --> 02:30:52.360]  if you might make your best guess
[02:30:52.360 --> 02:30:54.360]  on what the trigger event might be
[02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:56.360]  and then whether the Eurasian alliance
[02:30:56.360 --> 02:30:58.360]  is actually standing up against
[02:30:58.360 --> 02:31:00.360]  the Anglo-American Empire
[02:31:00.360 --> 02:31:02.360]  or if they're just waiting to join together
[02:31:02.360 --> 02:31:04.360]  is there a real split between Russia, China
[02:31:04.360 --> 02:31:06.360]  and the western powers
[02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:08.360]  and what do you see as a trigger
[02:31:08.360 --> 02:31:10.360]  for the total collapse
[02:31:10.360 --> 02:31:12.360]  as far as the alliance goes
[02:31:12.360 --> 02:31:14.360]  it's all about money
[02:31:14.360 --> 02:31:16.360]  whoever cuts the best deal
[02:31:16.360 --> 02:31:18.360]  they're going to do business with each other
[02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:20.360]  they'll fight whoever they want
[02:31:20.360 --> 02:31:22.360]  it's all about money
[02:31:22.360 --> 02:31:24.360]  so that's the name of that game
[02:31:24.360 --> 02:31:26.360]  and so the Russians
[02:31:26.360 --> 02:31:28.360]  and so the Americans
[02:31:28.360 --> 02:31:30.360]  they use democracy
[02:31:30.360 --> 02:31:32.360]  and human rights
[02:31:32.360 --> 02:31:34.360]  those are phony issues
[02:31:34.360 --> 02:31:36.360]  what can be the trigger
[02:31:36.360 --> 02:31:38.360]  we believe it's going to be a currency trigger
[02:31:38.360 --> 02:31:40.360]  that's our best guess
[02:31:40.360 --> 02:31:42.360]  whether it's the collapse of the euro
[02:31:42.360 --> 02:31:44.360]  gold prices
[02:31:44.360 --> 02:31:46.360]  eye-rocketing could be one of the triggers
[02:31:46.360 --> 02:31:48.360]  that's in the New York Times today
[02:31:48.360 --> 02:31:50.360]  they're admitting that gold going up
[02:31:50.360 --> 02:31:52.360]  is exposing derivatives
[02:31:52.360 --> 02:31:54.360]  of the central banks
[02:31:54.360 --> 02:31:56.360]  it's like holy water
[02:31:56.360 --> 02:31:58.360]  to count Dracula
[02:31:58.360 --> 02:32:00.360]  exactly so that's what we see it as
[02:32:00.360 --> 02:32:02.360]  mostly a financial crisis
[02:32:02.360 --> 02:32:04.360]  in terms of currencies
[02:32:04.360 --> 02:32:06.360]  and defaults on bonds
[02:32:06.360 --> 02:32:08.360]  and by the way
[02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:10.360]  why are these people so angry in Europe
[02:32:10.360 --> 02:32:12.360]  about paying the bondholders
[02:32:12.360 --> 02:32:14.360]  who are the bondholders
[02:32:14.360 --> 02:32:16.360]  if a country goes default
[02:32:16.360 --> 02:32:18.360]  they're the big banks
[02:32:18.360 --> 02:32:20.360]  that's the one that's right
[02:32:20.360 --> 02:32:22.360]  if a country goes into the country
[02:32:22.360 --> 02:32:24.360]  100%
[02:32:24.360 --> 02:32:26.360]  literally in many cases 100%
[02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:28.360]  goes back up to the banks
[02:32:28.360 --> 02:32:30.360]  and then the banks take the country's AAA
[02:32:30.360 --> 02:32:32.360]  rating away
[02:32:32.360 --> 02:32:34.360]  because they had to bail the banks out
[02:32:34.360 --> 02:32:36.360]  and the banks loan the money back to the country
[02:32:36.360 --> 02:32:38.360]  again
[02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:40.360]  it's the same club in control
[02:32:40.360 --> 02:32:42.360]  it's all about money
[02:32:42.360 --> 02:32:44.360]  that's why I said whatever the alliances
[02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:46.360]  are going to be
[02:32:46.360 --> 02:32:48.360]  it's only about money whatever the best deal is
[02:32:48.360 --> 02:32:50.360]  it's China, the US and Europe are teamed up
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:52.360]  and Russia knows it's the odd man out
[02:32:52.360 --> 02:32:54.360]  I'm not saying Russia isn't corrupt
[02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:56.360]  all these governments are but Russia
[02:32:56.360 --> 02:32:58.360]  is the wild card for my breakdown
[02:32:58.360 --> 02:33:00.360]  Gerald, what's your take on that?
[02:33:00.360 --> 02:33:02.360]  that's pretty fair but again
[02:33:02.360 --> 02:33:04.360]  the Chinese are going to go
[02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:06.360]  they'll go anywhere
[02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:08.360]  and if they're not doing enough trade
[02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:10.360]  they'll go where they get the most trade
[02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:12.360]  look how they're moving into Africa now
[02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:14.360]  and buying up some money
[02:33:14.360 --> 02:33:16.360]  absolutely they're taking over everywhere
[02:33:16.360 --> 02:33:18.360]  you're on the air with Gerald Solente
[02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:20.360]  good afternoon
[02:33:20.360 --> 02:33:22.360]  Alex and Gerald, great to speak with you
[02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:24.360]  I have a very quick comment
[02:33:24.360 --> 02:33:26.360]  and a question for both of you
[02:33:26.360 --> 02:33:28.360]  good
[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:30.360]  I think I figured out
[02:33:30.360 --> 02:33:32.360]  why Osama bin Laden and his lieutenants
[02:33:32.360 --> 02:33:34.360]  are hiding over in Iraq
[02:33:34.360 --> 02:33:36.360]  I think they're tired of being killed, don't you think?
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:38.360]  they've died
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:40.360]  two or three times already
[02:33:40.360 --> 02:33:42.360]  and I'd want to hide too
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:44.360]  I think I'd get tiresome
[02:33:44.360 --> 02:33:46.360]  after the first time
[02:33:46.360 --> 02:33:48.360]  but AC Griffith
[02:33:48.360 --> 02:33:50.360]  Alex and Gerald, who is a former NSA
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:52.360]  CIA worker
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:54.360]  he's reported over the last week
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:56.360]  that FEMA is amassing
[02:33:56.360 --> 02:33:58.360]  the infrastructure
[02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:00.360]  to displace or evacuate
[02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:02.360]  some 40 million people
[02:34:02.360 --> 02:34:04.360]  from the Gulf area
[02:34:04.360 --> 02:34:06.360]  as well as the east coast
[02:34:06.360 --> 02:34:08.360]  as this oil disaster
[02:34:08.360 --> 02:34:10.360]  makes its way up the east coast
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:12.360]  and he also reported
[02:34:12.360 --> 02:34:14.360]  according to his information
[02:34:14.360 --> 02:34:16.360]  on a scientific level
[02:34:16.360 --> 02:34:18.360]  that it will drift over the Atlantic ocean
[02:34:18.360 --> 02:34:20.360]  this oil contamination
[02:34:20.360 --> 02:34:22.360]  which is really a dispersant contamination
[02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:24.360]  isolating the benzene
[02:34:24.360 --> 02:34:26.360]  which is very dangerous for health
[02:34:26.360 --> 02:34:28.360]  all the way to Europe
[02:34:28.360 --> 02:34:30.360]  and then eventually around the world
[02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:32.360]  that's what the current show from satellite
[02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:34.360]  let me get Gerald Solente's take on this
[02:34:34.360 --> 02:34:36.360]  well yeah
[02:34:36.360 --> 02:34:38.360]  I agree
[02:34:38.360 --> 02:34:40.360]  it could be a huge disaster
[02:34:40.360 --> 02:34:42.360]  it could be a big place in a people
[02:34:42.360 --> 02:34:44.360]  this is kind of
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:46.360]  this kind of fits into those
[02:34:46.360 --> 02:34:48.360]  prophecy things
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:50.360]  that have been made about 2012
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:52.360]  well look at the volcano
[02:34:52.360 --> 02:34:54.360]  the last time they had a big volcano
[02:34:54.360 --> 02:34:56.360]  was the French Revolution
[02:34:56.360 --> 02:34:58.360]  the last time an Icelandic volcano did this
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:00.360]  yeah
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:02.360]  sorry, go ahead, you're making your point
[02:35:02.360 --> 02:35:04.360]  no, no
[02:35:04.360 --> 02:35:06.360]  that is the point
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:08.360]  the point is that we're going to see
[02:35:08.360 --> 02:35:10.360]  a catastrophe after another
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:12.360]  whether it's man-made natural disaster
[02:35:12.360 --> 02:35:14.360]  financial environmental
[02:35:14.360 --> 02:35:16.360]  it's all collapsing on it
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:18.360]  and we've noticed historically
[02:35:18.360 --> 02:35:20.360]  for some reason
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:22.360]  for some reason natural disasters
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:24.360]  seem to follow times of implosion as well
[02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:26.360]  it's like my grandma
[02:35:26.360 --> 02:35:28.360]  it's on its own momentum
[02:35:28.360 --> 02:35:30.360]  there are so many other forces that we don't know
[02:35:30.360 --> 02:35:32.360]  about that are interacting
[02:35:32.360 --> 02:35:34.360]  to cause a confluence
[02:35:34.360 --> 02:35:36.360]  that we're looking at now
[02:35:36.360 --> 02:35:38.360]  but we're saying that 2010
[02:35:38.360 --> 02:35:40.360]  is the breaking year
[02:35:40.360 --> 02:35:42.360]  well my grandfather told my dad
[02:35:42.360 --> 02:35:44.360]  he wouldn't tell many war stories about landing in Italy
[02:35:44.360 --> 02:35:46.360]  while Vesuvius
[02:35:46.360 --> 02:35:48.360]  was exploding
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:50.360]  while they were being shot at
[02:35:50.360 --> 02:35:52.360]  because he was in the Army Air Corps
[02:35:52.360 --> 02:35:54.360]  but they were leaving North Africa and actually landing them in the landings
[02:35:54.360 --> 02:35:56.360]  with the Germans shooting at him
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:58.360]  with Vesuvius exploding
[02:35:58.360 --> 02:36:00.360]  and it's just weird how all that stuff seems to run together
[02:36:00.360 --> 02:36:02.360]  it's strange isn't it
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:04.360]  yes it is
[02:36:04.360 --> 02:36:06.360]  Mr. Chairman one more before we got a break
[02:36:06.360 --> 02:36:08.360]  Mark in California you're on the air go ahead
[02:36:08.360 --> 02:36:10.360]  hey thanks for
[02:36:10.360 --> 02:36:12.360]  thanks for taking my question
[02:36:12.360 --> 02:36:14.360]  my question revolves around the
[02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:16.360]  United Nations law of the sea treaty
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:18.360]  and I'm wondering how
[02:36:18.360 --> 02:36:20.360]  the Gulf spill will impact the ongoing
[02:36:20.360 --> 02:36:22.360]  debate in Congress and I'll take my answer
[02:36:22.360 --> 02:36:24.360]  off there thanks guys
[02:36:24.360 --> 02:36:26.360]  I'm sorry I didn't hear that
[02:36:26.360 --> 02:36:28.360]  I'm wondering how
[02:36:28.360 --> 02:36:30.360]  the law of the sea treaty
[02:36:30.360 --> 02:36:32.360]  yes law of the sea treaty moving through
[02:36:32.360 --> 02:36:34.360]  from the oceans over to the UN
[02:36:34.360 --> 02:36:36.360]  which they'll then turn into a giant taxing grid
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:38.360]  Gerald Salente is our guest
[02:36:38.360 --> 02:36:40.360]  we'll be right back with him here
[02:36:40.360 --> 02:36:42.360]  in just a moment
[02:36:42.360 --> 02:36:44.360]  trendsresearch.com is the website
[02:36:44.360 --> 02:36:46.360]  he is the leading trends forecaster in the world
[02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:48.360]  and we're very honored
[02:36:48.360 --> 02:36:50.360]  that he spends so much time with us I'm Alex Jones
[02:36:58.360 --> 02:37:00.360]  well the time goes by very quick
[02:37:00.360 --> 02:37:02.360]  when Gerald Salente is our guest
[02:37:02.360 --> 02:37:04.360]  we appreciate him joining us at least once a month
[02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:06.360]  I wish his arm to come on
[02:37:06.360 --> 02:37:08.360]  more often because as things get more
[02:37:08.360 --> 02:37:10.360]  and more hectic as the quickening accelerates
[02:37:10.360 --> 02:37:12.360]  he's an invaluable source
[02:37:12.360 --> 02:37:14.360]  of information
[02:37:14.360 --> 02:37:16.360]  let's go ahead
[02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:18.360]  and go back
[02:37:18.360 --> 02:37:20.360]  to your phone calls
[02:37:20.360 --> 02:37:22.360]  up next is
[02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:24.360]  Greg in
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:26.360]  Kansas Greg you're on the air go ahead
[02:37:26.360 --> 02:37:28.360]  yes Alex if I can
[02:37:28.360 --> 02:37:30.360]  go straight to my question
[02:37:30.360 --> 02:37:32.360]  yes
[02:37:32.360 --> 02:37:34.360]  Mr. Salente could a possible way
[02:37:34.360 --> 02:37:36.360]  to mitigate the
[02:37:36.360 --> 02:37:38.360]  economic downturn B
[02:37:38.360 --> 02:37:40.360]  for communities who have their own currencies
[02:37:40.360 --> 02:37:42.360]  focused around silver
[02:37:44.360 --> 02:37:46.360]  you know it's too complicated
[02:37:46.360 --> 02:37:48.360]  and it's as I keep
[02:37:48.360 --> 02:37:50.360]  hearing about these communities
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:52.360]  trying to do that
[02:37:52.360 --> 02:37:54.360]  it's not really the issue
[02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:56.360]  the issue is we need a productive
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:58.360]  capacity
[02:37:58.360 --> 02:38:00.360]  we have to make things
[02:38:00.360 --> 02:38:02.360]  with 300 million people
[02:38:02.360 --> 02:38:04.360]  strong
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:06.360]  and they've put it in our minds
[02:38:06.360 --> 02:38:08.360]  that we are unable to manufacture
[02:38:08.360 --> 02:38:10.360]  and do business
[02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:12.360]  with each other
[02:38:12.360 --> 02:38:14.360]  well plus humans aren't happy
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:16.360]  unless they're digging in the dirt
[02:38:16.360 --> 02:38:18.360]  or working on things or hammering nails
[02:38:18.360 --> 02:38:20.360]  we're meant to build things
[02:38:20.360 --> 02:38:22.360]  we're meant to pick apples
[02:38:22.360 --> 02:38:24.360]  we're meant to pick figs
[02:38:24.360 --> 02:38:26.360]  we're supposed to be out there
[02:38:26.360 --> 02:38:28.360]  working
[02:38:28.360 --> 02:38:30.360]  exactly we've gone from a nation
[02:38:30.360 --> 02:38:32.360]  of craftsmen and manufacturers
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:34.360]  to clerks
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.360]  and cashiers
[02:38:36.360 --> 02:38:38.360]  think of the word service sector
[02:38:38.360 --> 02:38:40.360]  try servitude
[02:38:40.360 --> 02:38:42.360]  how about
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:44.360]  serve does
[02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:46.360]  servant fit in well
[02:38:46.360 --> 02:38:48.360]  that's what they've done to this country
[02:38:48.360 --> 02:38:50.360]  so the productive capacity that we see
[02:38:50.360 --> 02:38:52.360]  once again
[02:38:52.360 --> 02:38:54.360]  current events form future trends
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:56.360]  we have this atrocity going on
[02:38:56.360 --> 02:38:58.360]  in the Gulf of Mexico
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:00.360]  how about a real alternative energy
[02:39:00.360 --> 02:39:02.360]  we spend
[02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:04.360]  22 billion
[02:39:04.360 --> 02:39:06.360]  dollars in today's currency
[02:39:06.360 --> 02:39:08.360]  to develop the
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:10.360]  atom bomb
[02:39:10.360 --> 02:39:12.360]  and build Los Alamos
[02:39:12.360 --> 02:39:14.360]  if they were putting the energy
[02:39:14.360 --> 02:39:16.360]  and intelligence
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:18.360]  into having
[02:39:18.360 --> 02:39:20.360]  an alternative energy
[02:39:20.360 --> 02:39:22.360]  it's like writers of the
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:24.360]  Lost Ark as you know
[02:39:24.360 --> 02:39:26.360]  they've got warehouses full of it
[02:39:26.360 --> 02:39:28.360]  MIT a decade ago developed
[02:39:28.360 --> 02:39:30.360]  a type of cheap solar panel
[02:39:30.360 --> 02:39:32.360]  that could produce enough power
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:34.360]  to power every home you name it
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:36.360]  and the World Bank bought it
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:38.360]  even though taxpayers paid for it
[02:39:38.360 --> 02:39:40.360]  and isn't letting anybody have it
[02:39:40.360 --> 02:39:42.360]  it is a fact they are suppressing
[02:39:42.360 --> 02:39:44.360]  as you know
[02:39:44.360 --> 02:39:46.360]  the Valhalla of energy
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:48.360]  because they want us dependent on them
[02:39:48.360 --> 02:39:50.360]  exactly
[02:39:50.360 --> 02:39:52.360]  and the other point is
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:54.360]  look what got us out of the 1990s
[02:39:54.360 --> 02:39:56.360]  recession
[02:39:56.360 --> 02:39:58.360]  it's simple it was a productive capacity
[02:39:58.360 --> 02:40:00.360]  the internet revolution
[02:40:00.360 --> 02:40:02.360]  here we are on Skype
[02:40:02.360 --> 02:40:04.360]  look at how the world changed
[02:40:04.360 --> 02:40:06.360]  since the mid 1990s
[02:40:06.360 --> 02:40:08.360]  products were invented
[02:40:08.360 --> 02:40:10.360]  design manufactured
[02:40:10.360 --> 02:40:12.360]  and now with cyber security
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:14.360]  they say every IT person will be government certified
[02:40:14.360 --> 02:40:16.360]  the entire internet and all computers
[02:40:16.360 --> 02:40:18.360]  government certification for what you can build
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:20.360]  they're creating a new dark age there
[02:40:20.360 --> 02:40:22.360]  they've taken over healthcare
[02:40:22.360 --> 02:40:24.360]  they're taking over the ranches
[02:40:24.360 --> 02:40:26.360]  the farms they're taking over the Amish
[02:40:26.360 --> 02:40:28.360]  these people are a bunch of crooks
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:30.360]  no they're not they're fascists
[02:40:30.360 --> 02:40:32.360]  they're fascist crooks
[02:40:32.360 --> 02:40:34.360]  now I agree with you it's just unspeakable
[02:40:34.360 --> 02:40:36.360]  let's jam in one more call this is just incredible
[02:40:36.360 --> 02:40:38.360]  George in Connecticut you're on the air
[02:40:38.360 --> 02:40:40.360]  hi
[02:40:40.360 --> 02:40:42.360]  Gerald I think an idea I've had
[02:40:42.360 --> 02:40:44.360]  why don't we have a simulcast
[02:40:44.360 --> 02:40:46.360]  with all of the
[02:40:46.360 --> 02:40:48.360]  the free thinkers like Alex
[02:40:48.360 --> 02:40:50.360]  and Gary know
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:52.360]  that you've been on
[02:40:52.360 --> 02:40:54.360]  the guys that are growing in the audience
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:56.360]  and that also have an idea
[02:40:56.360 --> 02:40:58.360]  can you also give us the best
[02:40:58.360 --> 02:41:00.360]  battle plans
[02:41:00.360 --> 02:41:02.360]  to bring down these bankers
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:04.360]  and basically short circuit this possible war
[02:41:04.360 --> 02:41:06.360]  they want to
[02:41:06.360 --> 02:41:08.360]  Gerald I know
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:10.360]  I'm twisting your arm here but can we go to break
[02:41:10.360 --> 02:41:12.360]  come back with just five minutes without calls
[02:41:12.360 --> 02:41:14.360]  and cover solutions
[02:41:14.360 --> 02:41:16.360]  because I keep getting emails and calls off air saying solutions
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:18.360]  sure
[02:41:18.360 --> 02:41:20.360]  okay great let's jam in one more call before we go to break
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:22.360]  and we'll come back with five minutes of solutions
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:24.360]  and I'm getting into other news here
[02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:26.360]  because we've got to let Gerald go he's got work to do
[02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:28.360]  let's go ahead
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:30.360]  and talk to Dan in Alberta
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:32.360]  Dan you're on the air
[02:41:32.360 --> 02:41:34.360]  yeah just like to ask Gerald
[02:41:34.360 --> 02:41:36.360]  what do you think about BP
[02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:38.360]  and Goldman Sachs selling their shares
[02:41:38.360 --> 02:41:40.360]  during the slower part of the year
[02:41:40.360 --> 02:41:42.360]  if he thinks this Guantanamo Bay
[02:41:42.360 --> 02:41:44.360]  will finally be moved if Cuba is covered in oil
[02:41:44.360 --> 02:41:46.360]  and thanks for taking my call
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:48.360]  that BP issue is very
[02:41:48.360 --> 02:41:50.360]  very significant and
[02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:52.360]  I don't believe this guy Tony Hayward
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:54.360]  the president that little
[02:41:54.360 --> 02:41:56.360]  slimy cat out there
[02:41:56.360 --> 02:41:58.360]  has sold
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:00.360]  a couple of hundred thousand shares
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:02.360]  just before all this
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:04.360]  he sold 35% of his stock days before
[02:42:04.360 --> 02:42:06.360]  Goldman Sachs sold 44% of his
[02:42:06.360 --> 02:42:08.360]  record sales
[02:42:08.360 --> 02:42:10.360]  he's that greatest speculator
[02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:12.360]  and the other I mean did you hear this guy
[02:42:12.360 --> 02:42:14.360]  BP will make it right
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:16.360]  will fix it who are they kidding with this stuff
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:18.360]  no it's an inside job at some level
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:20.360]  it's all an inside job
[02:42:20.360 --> 02:42:22.360]  the only way you make hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:42:22.360 --> 02:42:24.360]  is being on an inside
[02:42:24.360 --> 02:42:26.360]  and knowing how the game is rigged
[02:42:26.360 --> 02:42:28.360]  so that's the way I say
[02:42:28.360 --> 02:42:30.360]  well said absolutely I mean
[02:42:30.360 --> 02:42:32.360]  the way they want anybody to fix it
[02:42:32.360 --> 02:42:34.360]  Obama wants to get his carbon tax now
[02:42:34.360 --> 02:42:36.360]  and saying oh it's a tax to clean up the Gulf
[02:42:36.360 --> 02:42:38.360]  total baloney
[02:42:38.360 --> 02:42:40.360]  we'll be back with Gerald Solentia to get some final solution points
[02:42:40.360 --> 02:42:42.360]  from him stay with us
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:50.360]  well Ted Nugent

[02:42:52.360 --> 02:42:54.360]  can't wait to talk to him about a host of issues
[02:42:54.360 --> 02:42:56.360]  but first off don't forget

[02:44:18.360 --> 02:44:20.360]  our greetings from the Nugent family
[02:44:20.360 --> 02:44:22.360]  and certainly the band and my crew
[02:44:22.360 --> 02:44:24.360]  and all my guides and outfitters
[02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:26.360]  and all my hunting and fishing and trapping
[02:44:26.360 --> 02:44:28.360]  and NRA blood brothers out there
[02:44:28.360 --> 02:44:30.360]  and thank you for staying true
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:32.360]  to logic the common sense
[02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:34.360]  self-evident truth in the American way
[02:44:34.360 --> 02:44:36.360]  you're doing God's work man
[02:44:36.360 --> 02:44:38.360]  thank you
[02:44:38.360 --> 02:44:40.360]  well thank you Ted before we get into
[02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:42.360]  all the things that are happening
[02:44:42.360 --> 02:44:44.360]  with Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama
[02:44:44.360 --> 02:44:46.360]  the Arizona situation
[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:48.360]  before we get into all of that
[02:44:48.360 --> 02:44:50.360]  the oil spill you name it
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:52.360]  tell us about the book that of course
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:54.360]  is a number one New York Times best seller
[02:44:54.360 --> 02:44:56.360]  now coming out in paperback
[02:44:56.360 --> 02:44:58.360]  the Nugent Manifesto a few years ago
[02:44:58.360 --> 02:45:00.360]  is an ongoing
[02:45:00.360 --> 02:45:02.360]  attempt
[02:45:02.360 --> 02:45:04.360]  and a successful one on my part
[02:45:04.360 --> 02:45:06.360]  to raise hell
[02:45:06.360 --> 02:45:08.360]  to actually have the audacity to participate
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:10.360]  in this sacred experiment self-government
[02:45:10.360 --> 02:45:12.360]  I believe Alex that what is in the pages
[02:45:12.360 --> 02:45:14.360]  of Ted White and Blue the Nugent Manifesto
[02:45:14.360 --> 02:45:16.360]  and certainly what you do on the radio every day
[02:45:16.360 --> 02:45:18.360]  and what more and more people are waking up
[02:45:18.360 --> 02:45:20.360]  to the reality of is that in order
[02:45:20.360 --> 02:45:22.360]  to earn your
[02:45:22.360 --> 02:45:24.360]  Americanism you have to
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:26.360]  actually participate
[02:45:26.360 --> 02:45:28.360]  and be engaged in
[02:45:28.360 --> 02:45:30.360]  this very responsible and very critical
[02:45:30.360 --> 02:45:32.360]  duty
[02:45:32.360 --> 02:45:34.360]  of a self experiment
[02:45:34.360 --> 02:45:36.360]  self-government
[02:45:36.360 --> 02:45:38.360]  I realized way back in the 60's
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:40.360]  when I was attacked on hippie rock and roll
[02:45:40.360 --> 02:45:42.360]  radio for not doing their drugs
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:44.360]  and not drooling and puking
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:46.360]  like all the other zombie dips out there
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:48.360]  and they would attack me for carrying a gun
[02:45:48.360 --> 02:45:50.360]  and believing in self defense
[02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:52.360]  and hunting and fishing and trapping
[02:45:52.360 --> 02:45:54.360]  these perfect
[02:45:54.360 --> 02:45:56.360]  environmental positives that the Nugent family
[02:45:56.360 --> 02:45:58.360]  celebrates that I realized
[02:45:58.360 --> 02:46:00.360]  that boy
[02:46:00.360 --> 02:46:02.360]  the left are brain
[02:46:02.360 --> 02:46:04.360]  dead
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:06.360]  they're dangerous, they literally celebrate
[02:46:06.360 --> 02:46:08.360]  the bad and the evil
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:10.360]  while I try to maximize the good
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:12.360]  so I started maximizing the good
[02:46:12.360 --> 02:46:14.360]  in an attempt to destroy the bad
[02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:16.360]  and the ugly
[02:46:16.360 --> 02:46:18.360]  and it's been very successful because
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:20.360]  I gotta tell you Alex I'm a gregarious guy
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:22.360]  we have an incredible tour right now
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:24.360]  50 years later
[02:46:24.360 --> 02:46:26.360]  it's called trample the weak, hurtle the dead
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:28.360]  I got the greatest band in the world
[02:46:28.360 --> 02:46:30.360]  we're selling out every night all these years later
[02:46:30.360 --> 02:46:32.360]  and the
[02:46:32.360 --> 02:46:34.360]  positive energy
[02:46:34.360 --> 02:46:36.360]  the goodwill, the decency
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:38.360]  the logic that Alex Jones represents
[02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:40.360]  the logic that is in
[02:46:40.360 --> 02:46:42.360]  Ted White and Blue the Nugent Manifesto
[02:46:42.360 --> 02:46:44.360]  and my weekly articles on
[02:46:44.360 --> 02:46:46.360]  humanevents.com and washingtontimes.com
[02:46:46.360 --> 02:46:48.360]  that I'm not the weirdo
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:50.360]  the left are the weirdo
[02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:52.360]  history has proven
[02:46:52.360 --> 02:46:54.360]  that everything Barack Obama
[02:46:54.360 --> 02:46:56.360]  stands for and is implementing
[02:46:56.360 --> 02:46:58.360]  has destroyed
[02:46:58.360 --> 02:47:00.360]  societies 100%
[02:47:00.360 --> 02:47:02.360]  of the time
[02:47:02.360 --> 02:47:04.360]  but if you continue to placate
[02:47:04.360 --> 02:47:06.360]  and try to cuddle
[02:47:06.360 --> 02:47:08.360]  with the pimps and the whores
[02:47:08.360 --> 02:47:10.360]  and the welfare brats
[02:47:10.360 --> 02:47:12.360]  that people will be inclined
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:14.360]  to vote for politicians
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:16.360]  who will give stuff to the pimps
[02:47:16.360 --> 02:47:18.360]  and the whores and the welfare brats
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:20.360]  so Ted White and Blue the Nugent Manifesto
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:22.360]  is a battle cry
[02:47:22.360 --> 02:47:24.360]  to bring the good
[02:47:24.360 --> 02:47:26.360]  forward and to
[02:47:26.360 --> 02:47:28.360]  celebrate the most productive American families there are
[02:47:28.360 --> 02:47:30.360]  while we crush the bad and the ugly
[02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:32.360]  of Barack Hussein Obama
[02:47:32.360 --> 02:47:34.360]  and his legions of pimps, whores
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:36.360]  and welfare brats
[02:47:36.360 --> 02:47:38.360]  well expanding on that liberty and freedom
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:40.360]  and building our republic
[02:47:40.360 --> 02:47:42.360]  and saving it from the jaws
[02:47:42.360 --> 02:47:44.360]  of collectivism and globalism
[02:47:44.360 --> 02:47:46.360]  this is not a spectator sport
[02:47:46.360 --> 02:47:48.360]  and that's what's so good about you Ted
[02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:50.360]  as I know you've been persecuted
[02:47:50.360 --> 02:47:52.360]  but it didn't
[02:47:52.360 --> 02:47:54.360]  make you cry and go into the shadows
[02:47:54.360 --> 02:47:56.360]  it didn't make you sell out to these people
[02:47:56.360 --> 02:47:58.360]  you stood up to them and became even more successful
[02:47:58.360 --> 02:48:00.360]  despite the fact
[02:48:00.360 --> 02:48:02.360]  in the last three decades that you didn't submit
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:04.360]  to their propaganda and brainwashing
[02:48:04.360 --> 02:48:06.360]  and as you said
[02:48:06.360 --> 02:48:08.360]  you have now succeeded doing it your way
[02:48:08.360 --> 02:48:10.360]  as a true American
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:12.360]  whereas they have failed
[02:48:12.360 --> 02:48:14.360]  your message is stronger now
[02:48:14.360 --> 02:48:16.360]  not weaker
[02:48:16.360 --> 02:48:18.360]  their message is weakening by the day
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:20.360]  they are bleeding out
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:22.360]  like some
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:24.360]  wildcat that Ted Nugent
[02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:26.360]  just blasted
[02:48:26.360 --> 02:48:28.360]  well you know for years I've been attacked
[02:48:28.360 --> 02:48:30.360]  as being an extremist and a radical
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:32.360]  and out of control and to all those
[02:48:32.360 --> 02:48:34.360]  accusations I would like to plead live
[02:48:34.360 --> 02:48:36.360]  on the Alex Jones radio to go
[02:48:36.360 --> 02:48:38.360]  you're damn right
[02:48:38.360 --> 02:48:40.360]  you're damn right I'm an extremist
[02:48:40.360 --> 02:48:42.360]  extremely free
[02:48:42.360 --> 02:48:44.360]  I'm not kind of free
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:46.360]  I don't kind of have individual rights
[02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:48.360]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg
[02:48:48.360 --> 02:48:50.360]  John Paul Stevens
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:52.360]  Sonia Sotomayor
[02:48:52.360 --> 02:48:54.360]  you racist punk
[02:48:54.360 --> 02:48:56.360]  Steven Breyer
[02:48:56.360 --> 02:48:58.360]  these subhuman anti-American
[02:48:58.360 --> 02:49:00.360]  punks
[02:49:00.360 --> 02:49:02.360]  in black robes in the Supreme Court of the United States
[02:49:02.360 --> 02:49:04.360]  who actually wrote Alex
[02:49:04.360 --> 02:49:06.360]  help me through this if I have an aneurysm
[02:49:06.360 --> 02:49:08.360]  on your radio circle
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:10.360]  don't want to resuscitate me
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:12.360]  because we have four
[02:49:12.360 --> 02:49:14.360]  Americans
[02:49:14.360 --> 02:49:16.360]  and I'm being generous with the term
[02:49:16.360 --> 02:49:18.360]  who have actually written a Supreme Court
[02:49:18.360 --> 02:49:20.360]  statement
[02:49:20.360 --> 02:49:22.360]  that American citizens
[02:49:22.360 --> 02:49:24.360]  have no fundamental right
[02:49:24.360 --> 02:49:26.360]  to self defense
[02:49:26.360 --> 02:49:28.360]  they didn't even say second amendmenters
[02:49:28.360 --> 02:49:30.360]  keeping bare arms
[02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.360]  these four subhuman
[02:49:32.360 --> 02:49:34.360]  Supreme Court punks
[02:49:34.360 --> 02:49:36.360]  don't believe that American citizens
[02:49:36.360 --> 02:49:38.360]  have a basic right
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:40.360]  to self defense
[02:49:40.360 --> 02:49:42.360]  I'm a creative guy Alex
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:44.360]  I'm an imaginative guy
[02:49:44.360 --> 02:49:46.360]  I not only wrote Wang Dang, Sweet Poon Dang
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:48.360]  I mean it every night when I sing it
[02:49:48.360 --> 02:49:50.360]  but my creative juices
[02:49:50.360 --> 02:49:52.360]  pale
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:54.360]  and come to a screeching halt
[02:49:54.360 --> 02:49:56.360]  trying to come up with something more offensive
[02:49:56.360 --> 02:49:58.360]  more anti-human
[02:49:58.360 --> 02:50:00.360]  than four
[02:50:00.360 --> 02:50:02.360]  punk anti-justices
[02:50:02.360 --> 02:50:04.360]  on the Supreme Court
[02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.360]  who don't think American citizens
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:08.360]  have the right to self defense
[02:50:08.360 --> 02:50:10.360]  I recommend they dial 1-800-EAT-ME
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:12.360]  Ted Nugent
[02:50:12.360 --> 02:50:14.360]  I mean this really is an act
[02:50:14.360 --> 02:50:16.360]  of treason, of sedition
[02:50:16.360 --> 02:50:18.360]  it's so dangerous
[02:50:18.360 --> 02:50:20.360]  Obama is now going to probably get a couple more justices in
[02:50:20.360 --> 02:50:22.360]  and instead of them
[02:50:22.360 --> 02:50:24.360]  ruling that we have a limited second amendment
[02:50:24.360 --> 02:50:26.360]  which is bad enough
[02:50:26.360 --> 02:50:28.360]  they're going to rule we have no right
[02:50:28.360 --> 02:50:30.360]  and we know Attorney General Holder
[02:50:30.360 --> 02:50:32.360]  in cases has argued that he believes
[02:50:32.360 --> 02:50:34.360]  there is a policy
[02:50:34.360 --> 02:50:36.360]  that Bill Clinton signed on to
[02:50:36.360 --> 02:50:38.360]  with the Unidire documents and the UN treaty
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:40.360]  that no citizen is allowed to have any firearm
[02:50:40.360 --> 02:50:42.360]  and that only the state
[02:50:42.360 --> 02:50:44.360]  can own guns as a quote power monopoly
[02:50:44.360 --> 02:50:46.360]  that's a quote
[02:50:46.360 --> 02:50:48.360]  the power monopoly of the state
[02:50:48.360 --> 02:50:50.360]  these people really are Joe Stalin
[02:50:50.360 --> 02:50:52.360]  Adolf Hitler
[02:50:52.360 --> 02:50:54.360]  Mao Zedong rolled into one
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:50:56.360]  they know that political power goes out of the barrel of the gun
[02:50:56.360 --> 02:50:58.360]  they know that we will be we the people
[02:50:58.360 --> 02:51:00.360]  as long as we're armed
[02:51:00.360 --> 02:51:02.360]  as that ultimate check against tyranny
[02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:04.360]  and that's why they hunger and lust
[02:51:04.360 --> 02:51:06.360]  after our precious guns
[02:51:06.360 --> 02:51:08.360]  and I will remind them that in
[02:51:08.360 --> 02:51:10.360]  1775 in Lexington and Concord
[02:51:10.360 --> 02:51:12.360]  the war was
[02:51:12.360 --> 02:51:14.360]  kicked off that led to 1776
[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:16.360]  and the Declaration of Independence
[02:51:16.360 --> 02:51:18.360]  and July 4th and mom and apple pie
[02:51:18.360 --> 02:51:20.360]  and everything good about this country
[02:51:20.360 --> 02:51:22.360]  when the British came
[02:51:22.360 --> 02:51:24.360]  to take the guns and the ammo
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:26.360]  and I remind them again
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:28.360]  that the day they try to actually say
[02:51:28.360 --> 02:51:30.360]  we can't own our guns
[02:51:30.360 --> 02:51:32.360]  is the day they're in a lot of trouble
[02:51:32.360 --> 02:51:34.360]  they are a bunch of wannabe Joe Stalin
[02:51:34.360 --> 02:51:36.360]  they are criminals
[02:51:36.360 --> 02:51:38.360]  I couldn't have said it better myself Alex
[02:51:38.360 --> 02:51:40.360]  God bless you for that
[02:51:40.360 --> 02:51:42.360]  that kind of inescapable historical evidence
[02:51:42.360 --> 02:51:44.360]  that you just articulated
[02:51:44.360 --> 02:51:46.360]  with the proper passion
[02:51:46.360 --> 02:51:48.360]  Alex feel good today
[02:51:48.360 --> 02:51:50.360]  in 2010
[02:51:50.360 --> 02:51:52.360]  that spirit
[02:51:52.360 --> 02:51:54.360]  that most critical and important
[02:51:54.360 --> 02:51:56.360]  American genetic trait of defiance
[02:51:56.360 --> 02:51:58.360]  is alive and well
[02:51:58.360 --> 02:52:00.360]  and growing out of the
[02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:02.360]  cesspool of apathy
[02:52:02.360 --> 02:52:04.360]  that allowed American citizens
[02:52:04.360 --> 02:52:06.360]  to bend over
[02:52:06.360 --> 02:52:08.360]  to the unforgivable degree
[02:52:08.360 --> 02:52:10.360]  to allow the Mao Tse Tung fan club
[02:52:10.360 --> 02:52:12.360]  into the White House
[02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:14.360]  and a lot of people out there
[02:52:14.360 --> 02:52:16.360]  Alex Jones and Ted Newt
[02:52:16.360 --> 02:52:18.360]  6th of his hours of praise now
[02:52:18.360 --> 02:52:20.360]  every word you say
[02:52:20.360 --> 02:52:22.360]  every word I wrote
[02:52:22.360 --> 02:52:24.360]  in Ted White and Blue the Nugent Manifesto
[02:52:24.360 --> 02:52:26.360]  my weekly columns
[02:52:26.360 --> 02:52:28.360]  at HumanEvents.com
[02:52:28.360 --> 02:52:30.360]  and WashingtonTimes.com
[02:52:30.360 --> 02:52:32.360]  you've got to connect with my website
[02:52:32.360 --> 02:52:34.360]  TedNugent.com
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:36.360]  I've got thousands of articles I've written
[02:52:36.360 --> 02:52:38.360]  that no one can argue with
[02:52:38.360 --> 02:52:40.360]  in fact here's the beauty of it Alex
[02:52:40.360 --> 02:52:42.360]  here's what my critics do
[02:52:42.360 --> 02:52:44.360]  when they attack me
[02:52:44.360 --> 02:52:46.360]  even on those websites
[02:52:46.360 --> 02:52:48.360]  those conservative websites
[02:52:48.360 --> 02:52:50.360]  they constantly repeat
[02:52:50.360 --> 02:52:52.360]  the solidly keep
[02:52:52.360 --> 02:52:54.360]  I write an article
[02:52:54.360 --> 02:52:56.360]  this is so beautiful I can hardly stand myself
[02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:58.360]  I'm more proud of what I'm about to tell you
[02:52:58.360 --> 02:53:00.360]  Alex than anything
[02:53:00.360 --> 02:53:02.360]  in my life
[02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:04.360]  every time I stand up and write an article
[02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:06.360]  or speak or do interviews
[02:53:06.360 --> 02:53:08.360]  the left goes berserk
[02:53:08.360 --> 02:53:10.360]  and they call me a draft dodger
[02:53:10.360 --> 02:53:12.360]  I did not dodge the draft
[02:53:12.360 --> 02:53:14.360]  I had a one-wide deferment
[02:53:14.360 --> 02:53:16.360]  they call me a child molester
[02:53:16.360 --> 02:53:18.360]  and sex offender
[02:53:18.360 --> 02:53:20.360]  I've never been charged
[02:53:20.360 --> 02:53:22.360]  or convicted
[02:53:22.360 --> 02:53:24.360]  of any of those evil accusations
[02:53:24.360 --> 02:53:26.360]  but based on the Solowinsky playbook
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:28.360]  that Hillary Clinton did her
[02:53:28.360 --> 02:53:30.360]  feces in college on
[02:53:30.360 --> 02:53:32.360]  they need to attack with the most vicious
[02:53:32.360 --> 02:53:34.360]  and hateful lies they can
[02:53:34.360 --> 02:53:36.360]  oh Ted, Ted
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:38.360]  you should be proud that's a badge of honor
[02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:40.360]  well listen, I mean
[02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:42.360]  they've had national TV and Chris Matthews
[02:53:42.360 --> 02:53:44.360]  claim that I'm calling for violence
[02:53:44.360 --> 02:53:46.360]  when I've never called for violence
[02:53:46.360 --> 02:53:48.360]  I've said we have a right to defend ourselves
[02:53:48.360 --> 02:53:50.360]  we have criminals
[02:53:50.360 --> 02:53:52.360]  I mean it's insane how much they lie
[02:53:52.360 --> 02:53:54.360]  but shifting gears into another area
[02:53:54.360 --> 02:53:56.360]  that follows that line
[02:53:56.360 --> 02:53:58.360]  I want to read you a quote here
[02:53:58.360 --> 02:54:00.360]  this is the definition of high treason
[02:54:00.360 --> 02:54:02.360]  participating in a war against one's country
[02:54:02.360 --> 02:54:04.360]  attempting to overthrow its government
[02:54:04.360 --> 02:54:06.360]  spying on its military its diplomats
[02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:08.360]  or its secret services
[02:54:08.360 --> 02:54:10.360]  for a hostile foreign power
[02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:12.360]  now what is it
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:14.360]  by definition to have Obama
[02:54:14.360 --> 02:54:16.360]  violate the 9th, 10th and 11th
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:18.360]  the 11th amendment says the federal government
[02:54:18.360 --> 02:54:20.360]  cannot sue a state or an individual
[02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:22.360]  on behalf of a foreign power
[02:54:22.360 --> 02:54:24.360]  or state and cannot sue an individual
[02:54:24.360 --> 02:54:26.360]  citizen on behalf of a foreign power
[02:54:26.360 --> 02:54:28.360]  state or individual
[02:54:28.360 --> 02:54:30.360]  so that's the 11th, not just the 10th amendment
[02:54:30.360 --> 02:54:32.360]  all the scholars looked at it
[02:54:32.360 --> 02:54:34.360]  and said that all the Arizona law does
[02:54:34.360 --> 02:54:36.360]  is it's a copy of the federal law
[02:54:36.360 --> 02:54:38.360]  and it says if we have first contact
[02:54:38.360 --> 02:54:40.360]  with a drunk driving illegal alien
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:42.360]  or if we come to a crime scene and they're an illegal
[02:54:42.360 --> 02:54:44.360]  alien with no ID, we're going to take them to jail
[02:54:44.360 --> 02:54:46.360]  so it's okay to throw the
[02:54:46.360 --> 02:54:48.360]  book at citizens in Colorado two days ago
[02:54:48.360 --> 02:54:50.360]  a 82 year old veteran
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:52.360]  was being robbed at his house
[02:54:52.360 --> 02:54:54.360]  they were stealing his vehicle
[02:54:54.360 --> 02:54:56.360]  his trailer, they tried to run over him
[02:54:56.360 --> 02:54:58.360]  he shot one of the illegals, the illegal pled guilty
[02:54:58.360 --> 02:55:00.360]  the police released the wounded illegal
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:02.360]  and his cohort and they're charging
[02:55:02.360 --> 02:55:04.360]  him with murder
[02:55:04.360 --> 02:55:06.360]  and he's facing life in prison
[02:55:06.360 --> 02:55:08.360]  so the border has collapsed
[02:55:08.360 --> 02:55:10.360]  sheriffs are begging for help
[02:55:10.360 --> 02:55:12.360]  80 plus miles into Arizona
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:14.360]  is literally run by illegals
[02:55:14.360 --> 02:55:16.360]  there's signs up saying don't drive down this road
[02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:18.360]  don't go on this national park
[02:55:18.360 --> 02:55:20.360]  don't go on the state park
[02:55:20.360 --> 02:55:22.360]  Arizona's begging for help
[02:55:22.360 --> 02:55:24.360]  and Obama sends the feds into
[02:55:24.360 --> 02:55:26.360]  Suam to block the state
[02:55:26.360 --> 02:55:28.360]  trying to restore law and order that is lawful
[02:55:28.360 --> 02:55:30.360]  and it's worse, Senator Kyle meets with Obama
[02:55:30.360 --> 02:55:32.360]  and Obama says I want that crisis
[02:55:32.360 --> 02:55:34.360]  to get worse to force through amnesty
[02:55:34.360 --> 02:55:36.360]  if that isn't high treason Ted Nugent
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:38.360]  what is it?
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:40.360]  well by all common sense and logic
[02:55:40.360 --> 02:55:42.360]  the president of the United States
[02:55:42.360 --> 02:55:44.360]  and most of his czars
[02:55:44.360 --> 02:55:46.360]  many of his administration
[02:55:46.360 --> 02:55:48.360]  are guilty of all the crimes
[02:55:48.360 --> 02:55:50.360]  he just outlined, anybody who doesn't get that
[02:55:50.360 --> 02:55:52.360]  is either brain dead
[02:55:52.360 --> 02:55:54.360]  or I have their heads so far up their asses
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:56.360]  not to have seen daylight that last century
[02:55:56.360 --> 02:55:58.360]  I believe
[02:55:58.360 --> 02:56:00.360]  that
[02:56:00.360 --> 02:56:02.360]  the good governor Brewer
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:04.360]  is doing God's work in Arizona
[02:56:04.360 --> 02:56:06.360]  I believe
[02:56:06.360 --> 02:56:08.360]  that the good citizens of Arizona
[02:56:08.360 --> 02:56:10.360]  was down there
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:12.360]  when the good rancher
[02:56:12.360 --> 02:56:14.360]  was murdered by illegal invaders
[02:56:14.360 --> 02:56:16.360]  and that our government did nothing
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:18.360]  did nothing in response to an American
[02:56:18.360 --> 02:56:20.360]  being murdered
[02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:22.360]  by Mexican invaders
[02:56:22.360 --> 02:56:24.360]  this wouldn't even qualify
[02:56:24.360 --> 02:56:26.360]  as a bad script for planet of the apes
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:28.360]  Alex
[02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:30.360]  but I have confidence
[02:56:30.360 --> 02:56:32.360]  I'm on tour right now
[02:56:32.360 --> 02:56:34.360]  I've already done like 20 some cities
[02:56:34.360 --> 02:56:36.360]  and I got another 40 to go
[02:56:36.360 --> 02:56:38.360]  I communicate
[02:56:38.360 --> 02:56:40.360]  with the heroes of law enforcement
[02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:42.360]  our border patrol agents
[02:56:42.360 --> 02:56:44.360]  all arms of the US military
[02:56:44.360 --> 02:56:46.360]  are at every concert
[02:56:46.360 --> 02:56:48.360]  we have a little powwow
[02:56:48.360 --> 02:56:50.360]  we drink a little ginger ale
[02:56:50.360 --> 02:56:52.360]  and we talk about the important issues
[02:56:52.360 --> 02:56:54.360]  and I believe
[02:56:54.360 --> 02:56:56.360]  that there is a growing activism
[02:56:56.360 --> 02:56:58.360]  there's a growing re-engagement
[02:56:58.360 --> 02:57:00.360]  of we the people
[02:57:00.360 --> 02:57:02.360]  we are once again identifying
[02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:04.360]  the self-evident truth that is articulated
[02:57:04.360 --> 02:57:06.360]  guaranteed in the US Constitution
[02:57:06.360 --> 02:57:08.360]  the Bill of Rights
[02:57:08.360 --> 02:57:10.360]  certainly that America is based on the Ten Commandments
[02:57:10.360 --> 02:57:12.360]  and the Golden Rule
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:14.360]  and overall excellence being the vehicle
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:16.360]  by which you achieve the American dream
[02:57:16.360 --> 02:57:18.360]  that's now starting to become
[02:57:18.360 --> 02:57:20.360]  a fist-pounding communication
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:22.360]  a little bit more passion
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:24.360]  more like Alex Jones would do
[02:57:24.360 --> 02:57:26.360]  like Ted Nugent would do
[02:57:26.360 --> 02:57:28.360]  I see a growing fervor
[02:57:28.360 --> 02:57:30.360]  and a growing enlightenment
[02:57:30.360 --> 02:57:32.360]  and communication amongst fanleaps
[02:57:32.360 --> 02:57:34.360]  at the workplace, at church, at school
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:36.360]  where we're starting to identify
[02:57:36.360 --> 02:57:38.360]  that the President hates America
[02:57:38.360 --> 02:57:40.360]  that the President hates
[02:57:40.360 --> 02:57:42.360]  the American dream
[02:57:42.360 --> 02:57:44.360]  that the President of the United States
[02:57:44.360 --> 02:57:46.360]  is waging war
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:48.360]  on the American dream
[02:57:48.360 --> 02:57:50.360]  entrepreneurialism
[02:57:50.360 --> 02:57:52.360]  and excellence
[02:57:52.360 --> 02:57:54.360]  he literally is implementing policies
[02:57:54.360 --> 02:57:56.360]  that are clear and present danger
[02:57:56.360 --> 02:57:58.360]  that are acts of treason
[02:57:58.360 --> 02:58:00.360]  and I believe that come November
[02:58:00.360 --> 02:58:02.360]  like we did up in Massachusetts
[02:58:02.360 --> 02:58:04.360]  and a few other midterm elections recently
[02:58:04.360 --> 02:58:06.360]  the incumbents and the feds,
[02:58:06.360 --> 02:58:08.360]  the corruptions
[02:58:08.360 --> 02:58:10.360]  the entrenched abuse of power
[02:58:10.360 --> 02:58:12.360]  that is rampant in our government today
[02:58:12.360 --> 02:58:15.360]  is going to get a rude awakening
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:17.360]  I believe that we're going to take this country back
[02:58:17.360 --> 02:58:19.360]  in a nonviolent way
[02:58:19.360 --> 02:58:21.360]  I believe that the very fact
[02:58:21.360 --> 02:58:23.360]  that there are more guns per capita
[02:58:23.360 --> 02:58:25.360]  in the United States, more ARs
[02:58:25.360 --> 02:58:27.360]  more ammo than any society
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:30.360]  in recorded history Alex
[02:58:30.360 --> 02:58:32.360]  the statistics are irrefutable
[02:58:32.360 --> 02:58:35.360]  that that is an entrenchment statement
[02:58:35.360 --> 02:58:37.360]  don't tread
[02:58:37.360 --> 02:58:38.360]  on me
[02:58:38.360 --> 02:58:40.360]  you better hope
[02:58:40.360 --> 02:58:42.360]  we take this country back
[02:58:42.360 --> 02:58:43.360]  nonviolently
[02:58:43.360 --> 02:58:45.360]  because we can and we will
[02:58:45.360 --> 02:58:47.360]  but the alternative
[02:58:47.360 --> 02:58:49.360]  will accomplish the same thing
[02:58:49.360 --> 02:58:51.360]  well the system knows that
[02:58:51.360 --> 02:58:53.360]  law enforcement sent us the Mayak
[02:58:53.360 --> 02:58:54.360]  and Homeland Security reports
[02:58:54.360 --> 02:58:55.360]  we broke that
[02:58:55.360 --> 02:58:57.360]  back in January of last year
[02:58:57.360 --> 02:58:58.360]  and they're not worried about
[02:58:58.360 --> 02:59:00.360]  people wearing turbans and caves
[02:59:00.360 --> 02:59:02.360]  that's what they sell the public on
[02:59:02.360 --> 02:59:05.360]  the entire federal apparatus
[02:59:05.360 --> 02:59:06.360]  under Lord Obama
[02:59:06.360 --> 02:59:08.360]  is for returning veterans
[02:59:08.360 --> 02:59:09.360]  gun owners, conservatives
[02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:11.360]  people like Ron Paul
[02:59:11.360 --> 02:59:14.360]  people even like the Libertarian presidential candidate
[02:59:14.360 --> 02:59:16.360]  that's pretty much milk toast Bob Barr
[02:59:16.360 --> 02:59:18.360]  they're saying if somebody has an American flag
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:20.360]  or get us out of the UN sticker on their car
[02:59:20.360 --> 02:59:22.360]  that they want to kill cops
[02:59:22.360 --> 02:59:24.360]  I mean this really shows the treason
[02:59:24.360 --> 02:59:26.360]  that basically those reports
[02:59:26.360 --> 02:59:28.360]  if you boil them down say
[02:59:28.360 --> 02:59:30.360]  that if you've got a portrait of John Wayne
[02:59:30.360 --> 02:59:32.360]  or Ted Nugent hanging in your house
[02:59:32.360 --> 02:59:33.360]  you're a terrorist
[02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:35.360]  yeah it's phenomenal
[02:59:35.360 --> 02:59:37.360]  if you listen to the president
[02:59:37.360 --> 02:59:39.360]  and his attorney general
[02:59:39.360 --> 02:59:41.360]  his secretary
[02:59:41.360 --> 02:59:43.360]  the entire administration
[02:59:43.360 --> 02:59:46.360]  if you listen to 9 out of 10 bureaucrats
[02:59:46.360 --> 02:59:48.360]  out there right now
[02:59:48.360 --> 02:59:50.360]  you literally are hearing
[02:59:50.360 --> 02:59:52.360]  without flinching
[02:59:52.360 --> 02:59:54.360]  they're hatred for America
[02:59:54.360 --> 02:59:57.360]  they're support for illegal invaders
[02:59:57.360 --> 03:00:01.360]  they're intentional dismantling
[03:00:01.360 --> 03:00:03.360]  of this American dream
[03:00:03.360 --> 03:00:04.360]  this is an American experiment
[03:00:04.360 --> 03:00:05.360]  self-government
[03:00:05.360 --> 03:00:07.360]  so again the Tea Party is but the tip
[03:00:07.360 --> 03:00:09.360]  of a cultural war spear
[03:00:09.360 --> 03:00:12.360]  that is being sharpened as we speak Alex
[03:00:12.360 --> 03:00:14.360]  again I think the prognosis is better
[03:00:14.360 --> 03:00:16.360]  than it was a few years ago
[03:00:16.360 --> 03:00:17.360]  the line drawn in the sand
[03:00:17.360 --> 03:00:18.360]  has never been more obvious
[03:00:18.360 --> 03:00:20.360]  and more defined
[03:00:20.360 --> 03:00:22.360]  I believe that more and more Americans
[03:00:22.360 --> 03:00:23.360]  are waking up
[03:00:23.360 --> 03:00:24.360]  that we have it
[03:00:24.360 --> 03:00:25.360]  we the people
[03:00:25.360 --> 03:00:27.360]  are the cause of all this
[03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:29.360]  we let the rats into our house
[03:00:29.360 --> 03:00:31.360]  for the last 50 years
[03:00:31.360 --> 03:00:33.360]  but it took a really
[03:00:33.360 --> 03:00:35.360]  stinky
[03:00:35.360 --> 03:00:36.360]  communist
[03:00:36.360 --> 03:00:38.360]  toxic rat
[03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:40.360]  like Barack Hussein Obama
[03:00:40.360 --> 03:00:43.360]  and his Mao Tse Tung fan club
[03:00:43.360 --> 03:00:45.360]  to finally wake up Americans
[03:00:45.360 --> 03:00:47.360]  that this man
[03:00:47.360 --> 03:00:49.360]  this community organizer and chief
[03:00:49.360 --> 03:00:52.360]  hates America
[03:00:52.360 --> 03:00:55.360]  and he would be just tickled pink
[03:00:55.360 --> 03:00:59.360]  if America turned into his Indonesian dream
[03:00:59.360 --> 03:01:01.360]  but we the people are waking up
[03:01:01.360 --> 03:01:03.360]  the Tea Party is the tip of the iceberg
[03:01:03.360 --> 03:01:04.360]  and I believe that we're going to vote
[03:01:04.360 --> 03:01:06.360]  these bastards out ASAP
[03:01:06.360 --> 03:01:08.360]  I believe that the next few years
[03:01:08.360 --> 03:01:10.360]  elections are going to be a
[03:01:10.360 --> 03:01:12.360]  shocking wake-up call
[03:01:12.360 --> 03:01:14.360]  to these abusive power monsters
[03:01:14.360 --> 03:01:16.360]  that come trickle down
[03:01:16.360 --> 03:01:18.360]  from the president of the United States
[03:01:18.360 --> 03:01:20.360]  so we do have to turn up the heat
[03:01:20.360 --> 03:01:21.360]  anybody right now
[03:01:21.360 --> 03:01:22.360]  Alex in America
[03:01:22.360 --> 03:01:24.360]  who's not in constant communication
[03:01:24.360 --> 03:01:25.360]  with their elected officials
[03:01:25.360 --> 03:01:26.360]  their senator
[03:01:26.360 --> 03:01:27.360]  their congressman
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:28.360]  their mayor
[03:01:28.360 --> 03:01:29.360]  their government
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:30.360]  their governor
[03:01:30.360 --> 03:01:32.360]  saying stop the tax and burn
[03:01:32.360 --> 03:01:34.360]  stop with this insanity
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:35.360]  of forbidding
[03:01:35.360 --> 03:01:37.360]  entrepreneurs from picking
[03:01:37.360 --> 03:01:39.360]  for the energy that we the people need
[03:01:39.360 --> 03:01:41.360]  the BP spill
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:44.360]  is between 001 to 8%
[03:01:44.360 --> 03:01:46.360]  of faults by BP
[03:01:46.360 --> 03:01:48.360]  and the drilling industry
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:50.360]  whereas the Phedzillocrats
[03:01:50.360 --> 03:01:53.360]  are guilty 99.8% of the time
[03:01:53.360 --> 03:01:55.360]  of abusing their power
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:57.360]  BP isn't the enemy
[03:01:57.360 --> 03:01:59.360]  Phedzilla is the enemy
[03:01:59.360 --> 03:02:00.360]  well I mean expanding on that
[03:02:00.360 --> 03:02:01.360]  of all the oil companies
[03:02:01.360 --> 03:02:03.360]  and I'm pro energy
[03:02:03.360 --> 03:02:04.360]  pro cheap energy
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:06.360]  and I am pro drill baby drill
[03:02:06.360 --> 03:02:09.360]  BP are the one oil company
[03:02:09.360 --> 03:02:10.360]  that pushed the carbon tax
[03:02:10.360 --> 03:02:11.360]  they're one of the biggest
[03:02:11.360 --> 03:02:12.360]  contributors to Obama
[03:02:12.360 --> 03:02:14.360]  they met with Ken Lay of Enron
[03:02:14.360 --> 03:02:15.360]  and Al Gore
[03:02:15.360 --> 03:02:17.360]  back in 1995 to come up
[03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:19.360]  with the carbon trading scheme
[03:02:19.360 --> 03:02:21.360]  and I'm very suspicious
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:22.360]  Ted of this whole thing
[03:02:22.360 --> 03:02:23.360]  and the way Obama
[03:02:23.360 --> 03:02:25.360]  has been blocking the relief effort
[03:02:25.360 --> 03:02:27.360]  and not letting those skimmerships
[03:02:27.360 --> 03:02:28.360]  and other things come in
[03:02:28.360 --> 03:02:29.360]  and blocking the states
[03:02:29.360 --> 03:02:30.360]  from building berms
[03:02:30.360 --> 03:02:31.360]  I think he wants this
[03:02:31.360 --> 03:02:32.360]  to be as bad as possible
[03:02:32.360 --> 03:02:33.360]  and he now admits
[03:02:33.360 --> 03:02:35.360]  he wants to get a carbon tax with it
[03:02:35.360 --> 03:02:36.360]  well I think your suspicions
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:37.360]  are well founded
[03:02:37.360 --> 03:02:38.360]  and I think that's
[03:02:38.360 --> 03:02:39.360]  again Alex
[03:02:39.360 --> 03:02:42.360]  the job of an American citizen
[03:02:42.360 --> 03:02:44.360]  is to remain suspicious
[03:02:44.360 --> 03:02:46.360]  to turn up the heat
[03:02:46.360 --> 03:02:47.360]  and the pressure
[03:02:47.360 --> 03:02:48.360]  and the probing
[03:02:48.360 --> 03:02:49.360]  and the scrutiny
[03:02:49.360 --> 03:02:50.360]  of our elected officials
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:51.360]  and our government
[03:02:51.360 --> 03:02:52.360]  constantly
[03:02:52.360 --> 03:02:54.360]  so I join you in that suspicion
[03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:56.360]  but I was stating a statistic
[03:02:56.360 --> 03:02:58.360]  regarding BP's spill rate
[03:02:58.360 --> 03:03:00.360]  and their so-called accident rate
[03:03:00.360 --> 03:03:01.360]  I'm still not sure
[03:03:01.360 --> 03:03:02.360]  whether it was an accident
[03:03:02.360 --> 03:03:03.360]  or negligence
[03:03:03.360 --> 03:03:04.360]  I gotta tell ya
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:05.360]  I've never been attacked
[03:03:05.360 --> 03:03:06.360]  in my home
[03:03:06.360 --> 03:03:07.360]  but I got a gun in every corner
[03:03:07.360 --> 03:03:09.360]  I've never had a fire in my house
[03:03:09.360 --> 03:03:10.360]  but I've got a fire
[03:03:10.360 --> 03:03:11.360]  regardless
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:13.360]  the rest of the industry
[03:03:13.360 --> 03:03:14.360]  shouldn't be punished
[03:03:14.360 --> 03:03:15.360]  for BP's bad record
[03:03:15.360 --> 03:03:17.360]  and they do have the worst record
[03:03:17.360 --> 03:03:18.360]  I mean that's communism
[03:03:18.360 --> 03:03:19.360]  Alex
[03:03:19.360 --> 03:03:21.360]  they won't be punished
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:22.360]  we will be
[03:03:22.360 --> 03:03:23.360]  exactly
[03:03:23.360 --> 03:03:24.360]  so I mean
[03:03:24.360 --> 03:03:25.360]  look if my neighbor
[03:03:25.360 --> 03:03:26.360]  commits a crime
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:27.360]  I don't go to jail with him
[03:03:27.360 --> 03:03:28.360]  that's communism
[03:03:28.360 --> 03:03:29.360]  yep
[03:03:29.360 --> 03:03:31.360]  welcome to the Marxist fan club
[03:03:31.360 --> 03:03:32.360]  of Barack Hussein Obama
[03:03:32.360 --> 03:03:33.360]  yeah that's it
[03:03:33.360 --> 03:03:34.360]  it's tragic
[03:03:34.360 --> 03:03:35.360]  well God bless you Alex
[03:03:35.360 --> 03:03:36.360]  for raising the
[03:03:36.360 --> 03:03:37.360]  raising the hell that you're raising
[03:03:37.360 --> 03:03:38.360]  I
[03:03:38.360 --> 03:03:39.360]  and I know your listeners
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:40.360]  are passionate
[03:03:40.360 --> 03:03:41.360]  and God bless you
[03:03:41.360 --> 03:03:42.360]  being right here
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:43.360]  for the greatest republic
[03:03:43.360 --> 03:03:44.360]  in the nation
[03:03:44.360 --> 03:03:45.360]  I mean Texas isn't perfect
[03:03:45.360 --> 03:03:46.360]  but boy
[03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:47.360]  at least my governor
[03:03:47.360 --> 03:03:48.360]  hutes coyotes
[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:49.360]  oh yeah
[03:03:49.360 --> 03:03:50.360]  here in Austin
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:51.360]  for the right direction
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:52.360]  Ted Nugent
[03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:53.360]  we're almost out of town
[03:03:53.360 --> 03:03:54.360]  we've only got about
[03:03:54.360 --> 03:03:55.360]  four minutes left for you
[03:03:55.360 --> 03:03:56.360]  and you've gotta go jump on a plane
[03:03:56.360 --> 03:03:58.360]  but a few other questions
[03:03:58.360 --> 03:03:59.360]  that I wanted to raise
[03:03:59.360 --> 03:04:00.360]  with Ted Nugent
[03:04:00.360 --> 03:04:01.360]  Lollie's whether it's
[03:04:01.360 --> 03:04:02.360]  TedNugent.com
[03:04:02.360 --> 03:04:03.360]  our site of course
[03:04:03.360 --> 03:04:05.360]  is infowars.com
[03:04:05.360 --> 03:04:07.360]  what is your overall
[03:04:07.360 --> 03:04:09.360]  view on the government takeover
[03:04:09.360 --> 03:04:10.360]  of healthcare
[03:04:10.360 --> 03:04:11.360]  now we're finding out
[03:04:11.360 --> 03:04:12.360]  it doesn't cover the uninsured
[03:04:12.360 --> 03:04:13.360]  now we find out
[03:04:13.360 --> 03:04:14.360]  the insurance companies
[03:04:14.360 --> 03:04:15.360]  wrote it
[03:04:15.360 --> 03:04:16.360]  now we find out
[03:04:16.360 --> 03:04:17.360]  the big offshore banks
[03:04:17.360 --> 03:04:18.360]  were involved
[03:04:18.360 --> 03:04:19.360]  now we find out
[03:04:19.360 --> 03:04:20.360]  it's just another bank
[03:04:20.360 --> 03:04:21.360]  or bailout
[03:04:21.360 --> 03:04:22.360]  well again
[03:04:22.360 --> 03:04:23.360]  God bless guys
[03:04:23.360 --> 03:04:24.360]  like Glenn Beck
[03:04:24.360 --> 03:04:25.360]  I've never seen anybody
[03:04:25.360 --> 03:04:26.360]  spotlight more cockroaches
[03:04:26.360 --> 03:04:27.360]  than Alex Jones
[03:04:27.360 --> 03:04:28.360]  and Glenn Beck
[03:04:28.360 --> 03:04:29.360]  and he's bringing forth
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:30.360]  these videos
[03:04:30.360 --> 03:04:31.360]  and showing
[03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:32.360]  the statements
[03:04:32.360 --> 03:04:34.360]  the unflinching statements
[03:04:34.360 --> 03:04:35.360]  by the Barack Obama
[03:04:35.360 --> 03:04:37.360]  cronies out there
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:39.360]  who have articulated
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:40.360]  the takeover
[03:04:40.360 --> 03:04:41.360]  of the healthcare industry
[03:04:41.360 --> 03:04:43.360]  is merely one of their baby steps
[03:04:43.360 --> 03:04:44.360]  although it could be
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:45.360]  a giant step
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:47.360]  much like cap and trade
[03:04:47.360 --> 03:04:48.360]  and the taking over
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:49.360]  of General Motors
[03:04:49.360 --> 03:04:51.360]  and the Fedsziller
[03:04:51.360 --> 03:04:54.360]  intrusion into
[03:04:54.360 --> 03:04:55.360]  a private business
[03:04:55.360 --> 03:04:56.360]  across this country
[03:04:56.360 --> 03:04:57.360]  that's all part
[03:04:57.360 --> 03:04:59.360]  of his Marxist agenda
[03:04:59.360 --> 03:05:01.360]  you really examine
[03:05:01.360 --> 03:05:02.360]  the voting record
[03:05:02.360 --> 03:05:03.360]  of Barack Obama
[03:05:03.360 --> 03:05:04.360]  who is basically
[03:05:04.360 --> 03:05:06.360]  a clueless rookie
[03:05:06.360 --> 03:05:07.360]  who is only credentials
[03:05:07.360 --> 03:05:08.360]  is a community
[03:05:08.360 --> 03:05:09.360]  organizer
[03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:10.360]  organizer
[03:05:10.360 --> 03:05:11.360]  which pretty much
[03:05:11.360 --> 03:05:13.360]  any hippie could do
[03:05:13.360 --> 03:05:15.360]  the president's agenda
[03:05:15.360 --> 03:05:17.360]  his czar's agenda
[03:05:17.360 --> 03:05:19.360]  his administration's agenda
[03:05:19.360 --> 03:05:22.360]  Van Jones was thrown out
[03:05:22.360 --> 03:05:23.360]  but Alex we all know
[03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:25.360]  that everybody
[03:05:25.360 --> 03:05:26.360]  around the president
[03:05:26.360 --> 03:05:29.360]  is a Van Jones
[03:05:29.360 --> 03:05:30.360]  and they're putting on
[03:05:30.360 --> 03:05:31.360]  their curtain tie
[03:05:31.360 --> 03:05:32.360]  and they're backing down
[03:05:32.360 --> 03:05:33.360]  their extremist
[03:05:33.360 --> 03:05:34.360]  revolutionary rhetoric
[03:05:34.360 --> 03:05:35.360]  so that they can be
[03:05:35.360 --> 03:05:37.360]  more palpable
[03:05:37.360 --> 03:05:38.360]  palatable
[03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:39.360]  when they come out
[03:05:39.360 --> 03:05:40.360]  that John P. Holdren
[03:05:40.360 --> 03:05:41.360]  wrote that he wants
[03:05:41.360 --> 03:05:42.360]  just a few years ago
[03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:43.360]  the complete transfer
[03:05:43.360 --> 03:05:45.360]  of our wealth globally
[03:05:45.360 --> 03:05:46.360]  I mean these guys
[03:05:46.360 --> 03:05:47.360]  are very dangerous
[03:05:47.360 --> 03:05:48.360]  but my last question
[03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:49.360]  for Ted Nugent is this Ted
[03:05:49.360 --> 03:05:50.360]  everybody I talk to
[03:05:50.360 --> 03:05:51.360]  gets the same intel
[03:05:51.360 --> 03:05:52.360]  and we see
[03:05:52.360 --> 03:05:53.360]  not just Democrats
[03:05:53.360 --> 03:05:54.360]  being voted out
[03:05:54.360 --> 03:05:55.360]  but pro-establishment
[03:05:55.360 --> 03:05:56.360]  Republicans
[03:05:56.360 --> 03:05:57.360]  in every primary
[03:05:57.360 --> 03:05:58.360]  so it's the incumbent
[03:05:58.360 --> 03:06:00.360]  establishment people
[03:06:00.360 --> 03:06:01.360]  that are being voted out
[03:06:01.360 --> 03:06:02.360]  this is a political
[03:06:02.360 --> 03:06:03.360]  realignment
[03:06:03.360 --> 03:06:04.360]  away from tyranny
[03:06:04.360 --> 03:06:06.360]  towards the foundation
[03:06:06.360 --> 03:06:07.360]  of this country
[03:06:07.360 --> 03:06:08.360]  in 1976
[03:06:08.360 --> 03:06:09.360]  and so
[03:06:09.360 --> 03:06:10.360]  I mean in closing
[03:06:10.360 --> 03:06:11.360]  it sounds like you're saying
[03:06:11.360 --> 03:06:12.360]  but I want it in your own words
[03:06:12.360 --> 03:06:13.360]  that you're seeing
[03:06:13.360 --> 03:06:14.360]  just a turbocharged
[03:06:14.360 --> 03:06:15.360]  awakening
[03:06:15.360 --> 03:06:16.360]  the likes of which
[03:06:16.360 --> 03:06:17.360]  you've never seen on the road
[03:06:17.360 --> 03:06:19.360]  I'm 62 years old this year
[03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:20.360]  Alex and I
[03:06:20.360 --> 03:06:21.360]  you're correct
[03:06:21.360 --> 03:06:22.360]  I'm seeing a turbocharged
[03:06:22.360 --> 03:06:23.360]  awakening
[03:06:23.360 --> 03:06:24.360]  across this country
[03:06:24.360 --> 03:06:26.360]  and most relievingly
[03:06:26.360 --> 03:06:27.360]  from the heroes
[03:06:27.360 --> 03:06:28.360]  of law enforcement
[03:06:28.360 --> 03:06:29.360]  and military
[03:06:29.360 --> 03:06:30.360]  where I believe
[03:06:30.360 --> 03:06:31.360]  and this is the deciding
[03:06:31.360 --> 03:06:32.360]  factor Alex
[03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:33.360]  and this is a
[03:06:33.360 --> 03:06:35.360]  great point to celebrate
[03:06:35.360 --> 03:06:37.360]  that if the
[03:06:37.360 --> 03:06:38.360]  there's a military term
[03:06:38.360 --> 03:06:39.360]  that I'll give you
[03:06:39.360 --> 03:06:40.360]  the first two syllables
[03:06:40.360 --> 03:06:41.360]  on your turn
[03:06:41.360 --> 03:06:42.360]  on your show
[03:06:42.360 --> 03:06:43.360]  it's a cluster
[03:06:43.360 --> 03:06:44.360]  it's a cluster whack
[03:06:44.360 --> 03:06:45.360]  so to speak
[03:06:45.360 --> 03:06:46.360]  that when
[03:06:46.360 --> 03:06:48.360]  and if
[03:06:48.360 --> 03:06:49.360]  these
[03:06:49.360 --> 03:06:51.360]  Mao Tse Tung fan clubbers
[03:06:51.360 --> 03:06:52.360]  in the White House
[03:06:52.360 --> 03:06:53.360]  and the Zars
[03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:54.360]  and the administration
[03:06:54.360 --> 03:06:55.360]  of Barack Hussein Obama
[03:06:55.360 --> 03:06:56.360]  if they dare
[03:06:56.360 --> 03:06:58.360]  continue down the road
[03:06:58.360 --> 03:06:59.360]  they're going
[03:06:59.360 --> 03:07:01.360]  and if all hell breaks loose
[03:07:01.360 --> 03:07:04.360]  I am convinced that the majority
[03:07:04.360 --> 03:07:05.360]  of law enforcement
[03:07:05.360 --> 03:07:08.360]  and the majority of military personnel
[03:07:08.360 --> 03:07:10.360]  will be on the side
[03:07:10.360 --> 03:07:11.360]  of we the people
[03:07:11.360 --> 03:07:13.360]  if that doesn't tell you something
[03:07:13.360 --> 03:07:15.360]  that they voluntarily
[03:07:15.360 --> 03:07:17.360]  offer that testimony
[03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:18.360]  everywhere I go
[03:07:18.360 --> 03:07:19.360]  that's an indicator
[03:07:19.360 --> 03:07:20.360]  that bring me great hope
[03:07:20.360 --> 03:07:21.360]  because I believe
[03:07:21.360 --> 03:07:23.360]  that we're going to take back this country
[03:07:23.360 --> 03:07:24.360]  in a nonviolent
[03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:25.360]  voting way
[03:07:25.360 --> 03:07:27.360]  it's going to be a huge takeover
[03:07:27.360 --> 03:07:28.360]  you're right the incumbents
[03:07:28.360 --> 03:07:30.360]  they're all guilty to some degree
[03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:31.360]  we need to watch
[03:07:31.360 --> 03:07:32.360]  and make sure that we keep
[03:07:32.360 --> 03:07:34.360]  the good guys in there
[03:07:34.360 --> 03:07:35.360]  we got some good guys
[03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:36.360]  like Mike Cox
[03:07:36.360 --> 03:07:37.360]  and Mike Rogers
[03:07:37.360 --> 03:07:38.360]  in Michigan
[03:07:38.360 --> 03:07:39.360]  we got good guys here in Texas
[03:07:39.360 --> 03:07:40.360]  like Governor Rick Perry
[03:07:40.360 --> 03:07:42.360]  and some of the Republicans
[03:07:42.360 --> 03:07:43.360]  there's actually a few Democrats out there
[03:07:43.360 --> 03:07:44.360]  that still pretend
[03:07:44.360 --> 03:07:45.360]  they're not in the same camp
[03:07:45.360 --> 03:07:46.360]  as Nancy Pelosi
[03:07:46.360 --> 03:07:48.360]  we wish them well
[03:07:48.360 --> 03:07:49.360]  but we the people
[03:07:49.360 --> 03:07:50.360]  are in charge
[03:07:50.360 --> 03:07:51.360]  and if we continue with the apathy
[03:07:51.360 --> 03:07:53.360]  America's going to hell
[03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:54.360]  if we re-engage
[03:07:54.360 --> 03:07:55.360]  and function as we the people
[03:07:55.360 --> 03:07:57.360]  suspicious of our government
[03:07:57.360 --> 03:07:58.360]  and constantly spotlighting
[03:07:58.360 --> 03:07:59.360]  the cockroaches
[03:07:59.360 --> 03:08:00.360]  and fed silicrats
[03:08:00.360 --> 03:08:01.360]  and abusers of power
[03:08:01.360 --> 03:08:03.360]  then we will get this great experiment
[03:08:03.360 --> 03:08:04.360]  self-government back soon
[03:08:04.360 --> 03:08:05.360]  I believe the prognosis
[03:08:05.360 --> 03:08:08.360]  is gaining positive momentum Alex
[03:08:08.360 --> 03:08:09.360]  but we need to turn up the heat
[03:08:09.360 --> 03:08:11.360]  and re-engage on every level
[03:08:11.360 --> 03:08:12.360]  in our neighborhoods
[03:08:12.360 --> 03:08:13.360]  in our churches
[03:08:13.360 --> 03:08:14.360]  in our schools
[03:08:14.360 --> 03:08:15.360]  in our communities
[03:08:15.360 --> 03:08:17.360]  and take this country back
[03:08:17.360 --> 03:08:18.360]  alright Ted Nugent
[03:08:18.360 --> 03:08:19.360]  thank you so much for the time
[03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:20.360]  he's on tour
[03:08:20.360 --> 03:08:21.360]  find out at TedNugent.com
[03:08:21.360 --> 03:08:31.360]  thank you Ted
