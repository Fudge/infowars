[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:37.400]  Texas Alex Jones remember a year and a half ago or more Lindsey Williams came
[00:37.400 --> 00:41.120]  on this radio show Pastor Lindsey Williams who had been a chaplain for
[00:41.120 --> 00:46.560]  Atlantic Richfield and other big oil companies up in Alaska he went public on
[00:46.560 --> 00:53.540]  this radio show when oil was a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel and he said
[00:53.540 --> 00:58.920]  it was going to be going to below 50 within just a couple months and then
[00:58.920 --> 01:05.200]  it would stay below 50 for a year and he was almost a hundred percent correct
[01:05.200 --> 01:13.920]  I've actually pulled out a calendar for about 11 months it was below 55 sometimes
[01:13.920 --> 01:23.000]  going as low as 33 but then before the year was up it started climbing back up
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.040]  to 70 75 $80 a barrel and it bounces up and down between those levels but of
[01:30.040 --> 01:36.600]  course his prediction which was stunningly accurate came specifically from
[01:36.600 --> 01:43.640]  a former oil company CEO that he spoke with he's gonna be here today for the
[01:43.640 --> 01:49.960]  first time he told me about three weeks ago he said I've had another meeting with
[01:49.960 --> 01:55.560]  this individual I've gotten some new information from him and I'm gonna go
[01:55.560 --> 02:05.520]  public on the 19th now I get so much intel break so much news cover so much
[02:05.520 --> 02:14.880]  information that I forget to toot my horn and the reason we need to point
[02:14.880 --> 02:18.360]  out when we're right is so that folks will go back and look it up for
[02:18.360 --> 02:21.360]  themselves and find out that people need to pay attention to what we talk
[02:21.360 --> 02:26.920]  about here on this radio show it was pointed out to me about eight nine
[02:26.920 --> 02:31.680]  months into Lindsay Williams prediction not a prediction his his his inside
[02:31.680 --> 02:35.480]  information that oil would go below 50 and stay that way for at least a year
[02:35.480 --> 02:41.200]  and it did roughly for a year now it's going back up but still half of what it
[02:41.200 --> 02:47.240]  was I think it was $76 when I checked on Friday in fact we
[02:47.240 --> 02:50.680]  guys look at oil prices today for me thanks just look up oil look up crude
[02:50.680 --> 03:01.160]  oil thanks that listeners pointed out hey Alex Paul Joseph Watson wrote
[03:01.160 --> 03:12.720]  articles on your reporting from Bilderberg 2008 in June and you reported
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.000]  that Bilderberg was going to slash oil prices by at least half that would have
[03:17.000 --> 03:29.080]  been down to about $75 a barrel which it is right now and that then they're
[03:29.080 --> 03:33.040]  going to jack it up again a few years later I mean I had forgotten that
[03:33.040 --> 03:38.680]  Bilderberg that that had leaked from Bilderberg and that we had reported that
[03:38.680 --> 03:46.080]  and that a month later Lindsay Williams comes out and reports it getting it from
[03:46.080 --> 03:51.080]  an elite source as well that that was the MO but it goes to the fact that the
[03:51.080 --> 03:54.680]  Bilderberg group really is steering planetary affairs to a great extent
[03:54.680 --> 03:59.240]  they're not dominating controlling everything but they are steering it and
[03:59.240 --> 04:02.840]  dominating most sovereign nations
[04:07.680 --> 04:12.360]  yeah that's heating oil you want crude oil
[04:12.520 --> 04:22.680]  oh there's petroleum no 78 bucks a barrel pardon me okay fantastic thank
[04:22.680 --> 04:33.360]  you you had $78 $78 a barrel oil prices slip after striking $79 a barrel

[08:13.520 --> 08:23.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[08:29.200 --> 08:37.080]  it is the 19th day of October 2009 on this Monday edition I want to thank
[08:37.080 --> 08:44.520]  everybody for joining us very important information to cover today this morning
[08:44.520 --> 08:49.920]  I was watching CNN and they reported matter of factly that during a flu
[08:49.920 --> 09:01.280]  pandemic which were supposedly under in a level 6 pandemic announcement by the
[09:01.280 --> 09:06.640]  United Nations means just that we are in a global pandemic now they changed what
[09:06.640 --> 09:11.760]  the pandemic is they changed the definitions to scare people and to
[09:11.760 --> 09:17.080]  activate emergency powers and emergency treaties that have been signed by the
[09:17.080 --> 09:21.160]  majority of nation states on the planet with the private United Nations the
[09:21.160 --> 09:25.800]  private governmental holding company for the private banking dictatorship that's
[09:25.800 --> 09:31.720]  forming on a planetary scale but they are saying that oh we're gonna start
[09:31.720 --> 09:36.440]  rationing care and they're just introducing these ideas to the public
[09:36.440 --> 09:41.000]  it's like they're introducing the idea that having more than one child should
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  be illegal and they're gonna ban television sets that use too much power
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.760]  and they're going to home inspect your your property and they're going to
[09:50.760 --> 09:55.640]  restrict what you can grow in your garden it's just all being announced
[09:55.640 --> 10:02.240]  tyranny worse than what we saw under Mao Zedong it's also big news right now
[10:02.240 --> 10:09.320]  that the new White House communications director has been giving speeches along
[10:09.320 --> 10:14.920]  with other members of his administration lauding Mao Zedong it does appear that
[10:14.920 --> 10:21.800]  the Obama White House mascot is Mao Zedong now the encyclopedia says he
[10:21.800 --> 10:29.920]  killed 66 million people Glenbeck says he killed 770 million the communist
[10:29.920 --> 10:35.120]  Chinese government says that Mao killed over 80 million and then they go on an
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.680]  official Chinese government histories and brag about it and say it was
[10:39.680 --> 10:45.360]  basically good oh yes the Chinese government admits he did this but this
[10:45.360 --> 10:54.880]  was needed for the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution and it is
[10:54.880 --> 11:03.160]  hard to believe that the Copenhagen global greenhouse emissions treaty does
[11:03.160 --> 11:07.560]  say repeatedly global government word-for-word world government global
[11:07.560 --> 11:11.720]  governance and that every facet of our lives will be completely controlled by
[11:11.720 --> 11:17.260]  an iron fist of environmentalist control freaks crawling all over us your
[11:17.260 --> 11:20.920]  children are being brainwashed right now in public school adults don't care
[11:20.920 --> 11:27.520]  what's happening they're busy watching sports the country is collapsing around
[11:27.520 --> 11:37.480]  us right now and this is only the beginning of the collapse of our nation
[11:37.480 --> 11:55.080]  big things are happening and it's sad that the majority of people are caught
[11:55.080 --> 11:58.600]  up either following the Democratic Party that's controlled by the private
[11:58.600 --> 12:02.000]  offshore corporations or the Republican Party controlled by the very same
[12:02.000 --> 12:10.640]  interest and we've been put into this herd mentality it's been conditioned
[12:10.640 --> 12:14.040]  into us I mean it's already there innately but but it's been heightened
[12:14.040 --> 12:25.480]  to like Coke Pepsi Ford Chevy Cowboys Redskins Republican Democrat black
[12:25.480 --> 12:32.560]  white Hispanic white Asian Hispanic Asian black Protestant against Catholic
[12:32.560 --> 12:40.960]  Catholic against Protestant Israel and the Jews against the Muslims vice versa
[12:40.960 --> 12:47.520]  and I see scores of news articles now flooding out I have a couple of them
[12:47.520 --> 12:53.400]  here in my stack but I also see it in the comments on info wars comm and
[12:53.400 --> 12:57.520]  prison planet comm and on our YouTube videos because I'm interested in what
[12:57.520 --> 13:02.520]  people are thinking and saying that whenever we post an article where the
[13:02.520 --> 13:06.760]  banks themselves are stating this is a world government they're going to be
[13:06.760 --> 13:14.960]  taxing and regulating every facet of our lives when Paul Watson writes an
[13:14.960 --> 13:19.320]  article about it or we link to an article about it under it people will
[13:19.320 --> 13:25.200]  come in and comment good it's time you dirty greedy westerners that use the
[13:25.200 --> 13:29.640]  majority of the world's resources and rob the third world it's time you pay
[13:29.640 --> 13:40.920]  it's time you pay a global tax and what's really creepy is sometimes I'll
[13:40.920 --> 13:45.400]  have my guys check the IP address and it'll be a think tank or it'll be a
[13:45.400 --> 13:50.440]  government group or it'll be somebody in the military but more often than not
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.520]  it's somebody who really has an IP address out of Venezuela or Nicaragua
[13:54.520 --> 14:01.400]  or El Salvador or out of Calcutta, India or it'll be somebody out of Saudi
[14:01.400 --> 14:05.040]  Arabia it'll be somebody out of an old world or developing world or third
[14:05.040 --> 14:11.760]  world country it'll be somebody out of Nigeria or you'll see them on YouTube
[14:11.760 --> 14:17.600]  with their handle you can click on their handle and go I mean if we post an
[14:17.600 --> 14:22.200]  article about the CIA staging Al Qaeda bombings in Iran with the White House
[14:22.200 --> 14:31.240]  admitting it we will get actual government disinfo agents in there and
[14:31.240 --> 14:38.240]  their classic playbook or ballgame is to say I'm a Israeli agent because they
[14:38.240 --> 14:41.640]  know people love that and so the government will come in and post it I'm
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.520]  an Israeli agent just to get everybody fighting and arguing with each other so
[14:45.520 --> 14:52.560]  that so that the debate isn't about the article or another playbook they run and
[14:52.560 --> 14:56.880]  we've tracked IPs and seeing the same person or different names will have
[14:56.880 --> 15:04.760]  fake arguments with each other and then if you check their previous post under
[15:04.760 --> 15:07.960]  their handle you'll find their previous handle and there they'll be on their own
[15:07.960 --> 15:13.400]  Myspace or their Facebook in military uniform where they Psyops badge on their
[15:13.400 --> 15:18.760]  shoulder I mean they don't even hide it and they'll run the play Alex works for
[15:18.760 --> 15:26.520]  the Vatican which is just asinine and then there's kind of mentally ill kind of
[15:26.520 --> 15:32.440]  borderline schizophrenics out there that believe it but the issue is to actually
[15:32.440 --> 15:38.720]  see them engaging us I mean this is real ladies and gentlemen but on the
[15:38.720 --> 15:45.760]  subject of the global carbon tax there are actual third world people who've
[15:45.760 --> 15:50.320]  taken the bait hook line and sinker because the news media in their
[15:50.320 --> 15:54.360]  countries in our country advertises rich nations have taken too many of the
[15:54.360 --> 15:59.360]  resources rich nations have polluted more with the deadly nerve gas carbon
[15:59.360 --> 16:03.200]  dioxide that kills everything it comes in contact with doesn't matter if you
[16:03.200 --> 16:07.320]  breathe it plants breathe it doesn't matter doesn't matter if we exhale it
[16:07.320 --> 16:12.560]  doesn't matter if it's part of the life cycle doesn't matter if our level of
[16:12.560 --> 16:16.920]  carbon dioxide is lower than what the ice core sample showed 200,000 years ago
[16:16.920 --> 16:21.040]  doesn't matter of every study shows that it makes plants grow faster have
[16:21.040 --> 16:26.120]  higher yields live longer be healthier they in tune put out more oxygen that
[16:26.120 --> 16:30.200]  the earth's actually at a low oxygen level right now lower than it's been
[16:30.200 --> 16:35.160]  previously and the humans thrive in a higher oxygen environment yes yes
[16:35.160 --> 16:43.040]  oxygen is good too I will assure you it's not al-qaeda but over I was on an
[16:43.040 --> 16:47.960]  airplane flight was asking people next to me do you think we should ban
[16:47.960 --> 16:53.920]  dihydrogen monoxide you know it's in the water and factories release it as
[16:53.920 --> 16:59.120]  part of their waste do you think we should ban it or would you sign a
[16:59.120 --> 17:05.600]  petition to to and several people I talked to said absolutely but one
[17:05.600 --> 17:10.160]  stewardess nice lady she she said I want to learn more about this dihydrogen
[17:10.160 --> 17:17.200]  monoxide and I said ma'am it's water just like carbon dioxide but it's got a
[17:17.200 --> 17:21.880]  scary name it's like sodium chloride does it's table salt most people will say
[17:21.880 --> 17:30.680]  ban it if you walk up to them so the issue here is that they have now been
[17:30.680 --> 17:35.560]  brought into class warfare the media says this will get the rich fat dumb
[17:35.560 --> 17:41.080]  Americans and no doubt we're rich compared to the rest of the world no no no
[17:41.080 --> 17:44.560]  doubt we become decking it but I'd like to see you third world people if you had
[17:44.560 --> 17:47.600]  a hundred years of milk and honey you probably couldn't even get up out of
[17:47.600 --> 17:51.240]  your beds we were great we were the smartest we were the toughest we were
[17:51.240 --> 17:55.240]  the best we had all the patents we were the we were definitely the best and now
[17:55.240 --> 18:00.600]  we're pretty seconding pretty pretty pretty disgusting on average got some
[18:00.600 --> 18:07.440]  high points got some low points but the median average is pretty disgusting but
[18:07.440 --> 18:11.600]  this is how the globalist operate divide and conquer and they've got the third
[18:11.600 --> 18:17.000]  world howling right now for the global carbon tax and and the U.S. told them oh
[18:17.000 --> 18:22.360]  yeah you don't have to sign on oh yeah you don't have to pay any tax the evil
[18:22.360 --> 18:31.040]  Americans do in the evil Brits and evil Germans and evil Japanese it's class
[18:31.040 --> 18:34.360]  warfare and the big banks are actually telling the third world countries the
[18:34.360 --> 18:39.360]  same IMF and World Bank that have raped them up one side and down the other
[18:39.360 --> 18:50.960]  every which way but loose just every which way and the same bankers are like
[18:50.960 --> 18:54.600]  yeah we're gonna we're gonna save the earth and they have stunts every day
[18:54.600 --> 19:00.360]  like government officials underwater with a conference table with a bunch of
[19:00.360 --> 19:07.680]  coral they'd killed and piled up between them oh killing the coral but they
[19:07.680 --> 19:10.440]  know the storms do it all the time the point is they got this big pile of
[19:10.440 --> 19:14.400]  coral between them and they're all shining underwater as a stunt saying
[19:14.400 --> 19:21.200]  that ove's islands in the Pacific will all be underwater total lies truth is
[19:21.200 --> 19:25.160]  the earth's cooling right now this trend continues for another 20 years we're
[19:25.160 --> 19:30.000]  gonna go into new ice age we better hope it's heating we better cross our
[19:30.000 --> 19:38.200]  fingers because we're on a 12 year 12,000 year 12,000 year we're also on a
[19:38.200 --> 19:43.920]  12 year Sun cycle 11 and a half but we're on a 12,000 year ice age cycle and

[24:22.840 --> 24:24.840]  I
[24:36.000 --> 24:41.120]  Lord Christopher Monkton has made big headlines in the US and thank God for an
[24:41.120 --> 24:46.920]  eloquently powerful speech he was a high-level Margaret Thatcher
[24:46.920 --> 24:52.800]  appointee and he's been over commissioned studying climate change and he
[24:52.800 --> 24:57.160]  gave an eloquent speech of a Minnesota to University group exposing that in
[24:57.160 --> 25:05.400]  the bill in the treaty and I happen to have the treaty section 38 a the
[25:05.400 --> 25:16.480]  Copenhagen Denmark treaty and it states global governance and Lord Monkton
[25:16.480 --> 25:21.280]  is absolutely on target we're gonna be covering that a little bit later world
[25:21.280 --> 25:28.880]  government is being formed right now they set up the skeletal system in
[25:28.880 --> 25:34.280]  decades past but now it is getting up on its legs and it is extremely
[25:34.280 --> 25:44.320]  authoritarian extremely parasitic it is a eugenics government 110% eugenics is
[25:44.320 --> 25:50.680]  the religion of the elite it is the belief system it is the overriding
[25:50.680 --> 25:57.840]  pillar of the scientific dictatorship and if I get any message across to the
[25:57.840 --> 26:03.920]  listeners it's this I am deeply studying the propaganda the brainwashing the
[26:03.920 --> 26:08.560]  different programming mechanisms that the establishment is using they
[26:08.560 --> 26:16.520]  understand humanity's tribal nature they understand our pack animal nature they
[26:16.520 --> 26:22.520]  understand what makes us tick what makes us operate and with devastating
[26:22.520 --> 26:29.640]  effect they are dividing and conquering and dumbing down and poisoning the
[26:29.640 --> 26:34.680]  population you and I know I repeat this in different ways in different
[26:34.680 --> 26:38.760]  permutations but listen to me let it consciously hit you if you're a new
[26:38.760 --> 26:45.360]  listener you are being poisoned through the GMO food through the water supply
[26:45.360 --> 26:52.120]  through the vaccines and drugs and through the air it is declassified it
[26:52.120 --> 27:00.800]  is public all totaled more than 20,000 declassified US government operations
[27:00.800 --> 27:09.680]  spring radiology radiological chemical biological on the population it is a
[27:09.680 --> 27:15.200]  fact that we have a group of scientific dictators they are into quantum
[27:15.200 --> 27:19.280]  mechanics they are into psychology they are into physiology they are into
[27:19.280 --> 27:25.800]  biology they are into the stars they are into the metaphysical they are deeply
[27:25.800 --> 27:30.880]  religious they believe they found the mysteries of the universe and they believe
[27:30.880 --> 27:38.760]  you are not worthy to go into the future you must be purged you must be
[27:38.760 --> 27:43.680]  cleansed you must be killed I don't know any other way to get this through to you
[27:43.680 --> 27:50.200]  and their point is look at the masses our operations are public but the masses
[27:50.200 --> 27:58.000]  have fallen to our design they say it is all fair play that they leave clues they
[27:58.000 --> 28:02.800]  write books they admit what they're doing in their own white papers and
[28:02.800 --> 28:08.960]  publish it and they even laugh at people in the white papers and say that this is
[28:08.960 --> 28:14.240]  evidence of why the public needs to be exterminated because even though this
[28:14.240 --> 28:18.880]  information is freely available you don't care it's kind of like a sign at the
[28:18.880 --> 28:33.800]  edge of a cliff a 500 foot cliff saying stay back danger stay back from edge you
[28:33.800 --> 28:36.440]  would think you know in the old days they wouldn't put signs like that on
[28:36.440 --> 28:40.600]  cliffs and cities and towns now you notice they're everywhere because people
[28:40.600 --> 28:43.640]  don't know they'll just go fall off side of the cliff they don't have their
[28:43.640 --> 28:47.680]  instinct to have a fear of heights that's that's not fear that's an instinct
[28:47.680 --> 28:56.480]  that's programming and I am a big sign here on the cliff going of this new
[28:56.480 --> 29:00.640]  world order is really bad news you might stop driving your bus off the edge of it
[29:00.640 --> 29:09.000]  you might put the brakes on their foul it is so horrifying to know what we're
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.760]  going through and to know how many children and men and women they're
[29:11.760 --> 29:17.520]  soft killing and to just see all the degenerative diseases numbers exploding
[29:17.520 --> 29:22.560]  off the chart rocketing up into the stratosphere all right I'm gonna news

[29:29.760 --> 29:33.280]  everything is divide and conquer that's their number one tool and I've always
[29:33.280 --> 29:37.480]  known that but more and more I I see the divide and conquer everywhere
[29:37.480 --> 29:41.560]  multiculturalism is meant to divide and conquer I'll explain that when we come
[29:41.560 --> 29:53.240]  back all of them we'll be right back we're on the March the Empire's on the

[33:41.360 --> 33:49.400]  freedom for this species I have declared my oath to protect and defend human
[33:49.400 --> 33:57.840]  liberty at all costs I have sworn eternal resistance against all forms of
[33:57.840 --> 34:07.960]  tyranny over the minds of men and every day I recommit myself in body and soul
[34:07.960 --> 34:14.680]  to try to be a pure and upright and virtuous good person who stands against
[34:14.680 --> 34:20.140]  the designs of the social engineers who have turned their intellects over to
[34:20.140 --> 34:28.600]  complete evil in the raw search for power over their own species I pledge
[34:28.600 --> 34:37.560]  myself in eternal resistance to all forms of evil and I ask the spirit of the
[34:37.560 --> 34:45.680]  universe the creator of all it is to use me as a vessel against all forms of
[34:45.680 --> 34:53.000]  scum all forms of delinium all forms of abuse all that seek to abuse and
[34:53.000 --> 35:16.440]  control and dominate the innocent the beautiful the meat the honorable I want
[35:16.440 --> 35:23.060]  to make one more point here first off the toll-free number to join us on air is
[35:23.060 --> 35:40.240]  1-800-259-9231 and the elite understand the score they understand the
[35:40.240 --> 35:45.800]  prize they understand what is in the balance here they understand what the
[35:45.800 --> 35:52.400]  spoils are they aren't going to control human destiny into the future they are
[35:52.400 --> 35:57.920]  going to choose whose progeny goes forward into space they are going to
[35:57.920 --> 36:05.480]  decide whose progeny discovers the secrets of the universe they are going
[36:05.480 --> 36:13.160]  to decide whose progeny is given life extension they are going to decide this
[36:13.160 --> 36:23.320]  is a unspeakably horrible crime being committed and I know they've sold a lot
[36:23.320 --> 36:28.360]  of good people on eugenics because they only show you one level of eugenics and
[36:28.360 --> 36:36.160]  they show you the slobs the people who are mindless people who are nothing but
[36:36.160 --> 36:42.800]  biological androids programmed by the culture by the media and you look at
[36:42.800 --> 36:47.840]  them drooling like herds of animals grabbing the products grabbing the
[36:47.840 --> 36:53.120]  goods going and watching their mindless TV programs and sports events and you
[36:53.120 --> 36:57.160]  see that and you think my god these people outnumber us a hundred to one
[36:57.160 --> 37:01.800]  thinking people and my god they're dangerous and my god they're breeding
[37:01.800 --> 37:07.040]  quickly I don't care whether it's white trash it doesn't matter who you're
[37:07.040 --> 37:12.920]  talking about the look of degraded humanity we all know what it looks like
[37:12.920 --> 37:18.960]  and so the elite sell this to all the best minds all the highest scores all
[37:18.960 --> 37:24.680]  the people who who are excelling the religion it's a religion of elitism what
[37:24.680 --> 37:31.120]  they don't tell you when you join the eugenics cult is that it's a cult and
[37:31.120 --> 37:35.720]  you're in one of the outer rings you are not anywhere near the center of the ring
[37:35.720 --> 37:40.960]  I have read the writings of the internal people but not just what they admit I
[37:40.960 --> 37:45.360]  have seen the manifestation of their operations and so I know the very letter
[37:45.360 --> 37:50.000]  and the very words of their program again I want to explain intelligence to
[37:50.000 --> 37:57.360]  people that I have learned organically okay and then later I actually read
[37:57.360 --> 38:02.760]  declassified intelligence psi op manuals and what I already instinctively knew
[38:02.760 --> 38:12.400]  was their word-for-word just like I know the globalist plans I know what's
[38:12.400 --> 38:16.200]  gonna be in a treaty before I read it because I've read enough of their
[38:16.200 --> 38:20.040]  previous treaties I've read enough of their previous operations but even
[38:20.040 --> 38:27.800]  things that have never been declassified until recently I knew word for word what
[38:27.800 --> 38:34.360]  it was going to be not because of some divine revelation not from some crystal
[38:34.360 --> 38:43.600]  ball as I wore a pointed blue cap with yellow stars on it no I'm not Gandalf the
[38:43.600 --> 38:50.840]  gray I know word for word what's in their battle plans because I can see the
[38:50.840 --> 38:59.360]  manifestation of it on the ground I can see their operations moving in plain
[38:59.360 --> 39:04.320]  view and I can see level after level designed for each different psychology
[39:04.320 --> 39:12.160]  type I can see the strata I can see the substrat I can beam with x-ray vision
[39:12.160 --> 39:16.880]  directly into their operations and let me tell you it is not pretty and it takes
[39:16.880 --> 39:24.200]  a strong heart and mind to be able to focus on it because when you stare into
[39:24.200 --> 39:30.000]  the enemy operation you see the design of not just their control grid but of the
[39:30.000 --> 39:36.960]  entity of the intelligence of the group collective of sociopaths and
[39:36.960 --> 39:44.840]  psychopaths and hyper competitive control freaks that run this system and when
[39:44.840 --> 39:50.080]  you look into their system you notice they're looking right back at you and
[39:50.080 --> 40:00.240]  they're saying why don't you join us they say why don't you join us and they
[40:00.240 --> 40:05.720]  say because you are flawed and emotional and sentimental and you have a
[40:05.720 --> 40:12.240]  persecution complex and you think dying for these people is going to help you
[40:12.240 --> 40:19.440]  the only way you carry your genetics forward is to join with us you must join
[40:19.440 --> 40:29.840]  with us or you will be destroyed and to that I say to the elite look at what you
[40:29.840 --> 40:36.000]  produce look at what you create look at your art look at what you're into you
[40:36.000 --> 40:41.560]  are into darkness and death and destruction and you rationalize all of
[40:41.560 --> 40:45.240]  your murdering and destruction and tyranny in the name of your social
[40:45.240 --> 40:51.680]  Darwinistic system but I say look at what you are and look at what you produce
[40:51.680 --> 40:55.760]  and look at if you're so advanced and wonderful why don't you just teach
[40:55.760 --> 40:59.800]  everyone no you don't do that you try to dumb everyone down and get them
[40:59.800 --> 41:11.560]  tribally diverted and distracted off into human simulators of life simulators
[41:11.560 --> 41:17.040]  are simulating manhood simulating womanhood but people instinctively are
[41:17.040 --> 41:22.720]  completely empty that's the genius of this new world order system that's the
[41:22.720 --> 41:34.240]  genius of it is that they know subconsciously we are aware that we're in
[41:34.240 --> 41:41.440]  great danger so they misplace that fear that we have inately of the system
[41:41.440 --> 41:47.360]  search your mind and and you know the the larger more powerful subconscious
[41:47.360 --> 41:52.360]  computer you will find your real concern is for the government and for the elite
[41:52.360 --> 41:56.120]  you're not really scared of men in a cave even if you believe al-qaeda hit us on
[41:56.120 --> 42:00.200]  9-11 are you does the hair stand up on the back of your neck when you think
[42:00.200 --> 42:03.320]  about it some have been laden or just stand up on the back of your neck when
[42:03.320 --> 42:08.920]  you think about Henry Kissinger towards W. Bush and Barack Obama you know in
[42:08.920 --> 42:18.720]  your soul you know in that incredible computer the creator gave you who the
[42:18.720 --> 42:24.840]  real enemy is but see the genius of the elite is as long as we're
[42:24.840 --> 42:30.440]  unconscious and always distracted by the latest flashy colors thrown up on our
[42:30.440 --> 42:35.480]  face by the peacock that's the new world order oh don't think the elite
[42:35.480 --> 42:38.880]  themselves are really preening and into all of that that's why they all look
[42:38.880 --> 42:41.880]  like hell the real elite because they don't care what they look like it's all
[42:41.880 --> 42:47.600]  about the mind all the distractions all the diversions but the point is their
[42:47.600 --> 42:55.040]  geniuses they know we're innately terrified so they project and move our
[42:55.040 --> 43:01.000]  innate proper fear proper concern fear is to make you get charged up and ready
[43:01.000 --> 43:08.360]  ready to stand up or to flee and they misplace it and refocus it onto the
[43:08.360 --> 43:18.040]  imaginary Immanuel Goldstein of 1984 the turban to summer bin Laden you see you
[43:18.040 --> 43:23.840]  have that innate fear of them and it's been misplaced off of the innate fear
[43:23.840 --> 43:35.200]  you already had and that's their true genius and and and they repeat that over
[43:35.200 --> 43:39.080]  and over and over and over and over again look at how the government is
[43:39.080 --> 43:46.640]  running a giant at least four decades long now declassified terraforming they
[43:46.640 --> 43:52.520]  call it geoengineering because tariff farm I guess is take a planet and make
[43:52.520 --> 43:58.000]  it livable we don't know exactly what they're doing we just know they've
[43:58.000 --> 44:01.480]  declassified that they're completely manipulating the weather on a planetary
[44:01.480 --> 44:12.520]  scale and we know it's not good we know it's causing all sorts of droughts and
[44:12.520 --> 44:17.800]  floods and they flood us in the winter and drought us in the summer and we know
[44:17.800 --> 44:23.720]  they've made the earth according to NASA 20% darker we know they're we know
[44:23.720 --> 44:27.120]  scientists study what was being sprayed and it was barium salts and aluminum to
[44:27.120 --> 44:32.280]  oxide and then lo and behold eco science author White House science are first
[44:32.280 --> 44:38.320]  press conference he gave in February to the AP was we're going to terraform the
[44:38.320 --> 44:41.760]  planet we're going to geoengineer it went we've already been doing it in a
[44:41.760 --> 44:47.240]  massive 40-year study yeah you call hurricanes that they control and
[44:47.240 --> 44:51.920]  manipulate and that was that was certified by the Pentagon in 1967
[44:51.920 --> 44:57.040]  Stanford Research Institute I've interviewed the head of the program Ben
[44:57.040 --> 45:04.840]  Livingston I mean I saw an article in here was in my stack yesterday I think
[45:04.840 --> 45:09.480]  it was AP it's in the yesterday's stack I'll get to it later the point is is the
[45:09.480 --> 45:16.480]  article said oh Russians guarantee a snowless winner in Moscow I mean over
[45:16.480 --> 45:19.360]  in Russia they just admit on the news we're going to send a rainstorm over
[45:19.360 --> 45:23.440]  here we're going to we're going to use these antenna arrays we've got to knock
[45:23.440 --> 45:28.880]  out this storm and when they guarantee it they guarantee it
[45:31.000 --> 45:38.720]  China admits to their public they've got weather control we've got a UN treaty
[45:38.720 --> 45:47.560]  from the 70s what is it 76 on weather modification and you walk up to some
[45:47.560 --> 45:53.080]  yuppie and they're just gonna laugh at you because they're like 10-year-old
[45:53.080 --> 46:00.400]  Eddie Haskells they have an arrogant self-satisfied and I read a lot of
[46:00.400 --> 46:03.600]  philosophers talking about this throughout history George Arwell who I
[46:03.600 --> 46:08.760]  see as a philosopher Eric Blair it's a real name you know he described in his
[46:08.760 --> 46:16.760]  essays the dumb servile enjoyment of some people under the British Empire saying
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.920]  India how a lot of locals played a little mind game with themselves and they
[46:21.920 --> 46:25.960]  would go ahead and rat you know rat out their neighbors for no reason to the
[46:25.960 --> 46:31.880]  Imperial police he was one of them and how they would enjoy tattling on people
[46:31.880 --> 46:38.480]  and how they were total slaves to but they at least got a pat on the head and
[46:38.480 --> 46:43.600]  I see this adults think that if they laugh at something and make it a joke that
[46:43.600 --> 46:50.480]  it somehow gives them power over it see I've never been like that I always want
[46:50.480 --> 46:53.880]  to know my enemy I always want to really address their strengths I don't want to
[46:53.880 --> 46:59.080]  overestimate my strengths I want to underestimate my strengths but then again
[46:59.080 --> 47:02.240]  I remember having an epiphany when I was on the back porch in my parents house in
[47:02.240 --> 47:08.880]  a beautiful sunny day watching a rainbow in the sprinkler in the backyard the
[47:08.880 --> 47:13.200]  epiphany that I was not an island and that I was part of a larger spectrum of
[47:13.200 --> 47:20.880]  life on this planet and that I was imagining I was an astronaut or I was
[47:20.880 --> 47:23.440]  Batman and Robin you know every five minutes me and my friend would play some
[47:23.440 --> 47:28.680]  other game or cowboys and Indians and I realize in this moment I'm not really a
[47:28.680 --> 47:34.880]  cowboy or I'm not really spider-man I am a entity living on this plane of
[47:34.880 --> 47:42.480]  existence on a planet and it was like a data download and then I realized as I
[47:42.480 --> 47:49.200]  grew up that people like dressing up and people like going to events and people
[47:49.200 --> 47:52.400]  like puffing up in front of other people because that's innately part of our
[47:52.400 --> 47:57.720]  programming but only a substrat a base operation program dealing with mating
[47:57.720 --> 48:03.880]  and that then humanity has a hierarchy of development above that towards our
[48:03.880 --> 48:10.360]  ultimate destiny of colonizing the stars and going to the next level which we
[48:10.360 --> 48:22.840]  cannot even imagine what our destiny is I can imagine but I'm sure you can
[48:22.840 --> 48:29.160]  imagine but I'm just I'm not gonna the point is is it's I can imagine how
[48:29.160 --> 48:38.000]  unimaginable it is I can see it but I know that I it's like having a
[48:38.000 --> 48:43.480]  photograph of a of a gorilla or a photograph of a dolphin or a photograph
[48:43.480 --> 48:46.800]  of a grizzly bear I can see a photograph of it that's different than being
[48:46.800 --> 48:56.520]  face-to-face with it but I can see I can see where we can go and the elite don't
[48:56.520 --> 49:00.880]  want us to go there and they're sickening poetry about how they want to kill
[49:00.880 --> 49:04.520]  everybody and kill themselves and destroy the universe and how that's why
[49:04.520 --> 49:08.840]  they want power these are some very dark people
[49:14.840 --> 49:27.560]  all right look I I'm gonna give you a prelude of some of the news and then I
[49:27.560 --> 49:34.080]  will take some calls at 1-800-259-9231 and we will get you up and on the
[49:34.080 --> 49:46.400]  air I do want to briefly before this segment ends tell you that request for
[49:46.400 --> 49:54.440]  you to meditate on the fact to contemplate how far we've come together

[50:02.040 --> 50:05.520]  damage we've done to the New World Order they're actually concerned though
[50:05.520 --> 50:10.480]  they are scientifically studying us and figuring out how to deal with us and
[50:10.480 --> 50:14.320]  they've already projected with their supercomputers what we're going to
[50:14.320 --> 50:21.320]  develop into you can project with your mind the different paths and avenues I
[50:22.320 --> 50:26.160]  would encourage people running those simulations and people serving the
[50:26.160 --> 50:31.680]  system to not get myopically with tunnel vision caught up in your own target
[50:31.680 --> 50:40.800]  you're shooting at like a fighter pilot coming in over a train and to not get
[50:40.800 --> 50:47.960]  target Narcosis and fly into us because that is what you're doing carrying
[50:47.960 --> 50:51.480]  this out I hope you understand you're destroying yourself and your entire
[50:51.480 --> 50:56.520]  family by serving what you're serving well when I come back I'll finish this

[55:03.120 --> 55:08.160]  yourself teach you decide that life isn't good teach you that first oh people
[55:08.160 --> 55:11.480]  should be able to commit suicide if they want and oh the state should be able to

[55:15.600 --> 55:19.680]  you because we're in a socialist system now and we all have to pay for these
[55:19.680 --> 55:24.440]  old people we don't just not visit our parents in the nursing homes we kill

[55:44.360 --> 55:48.200]  destroy the third world you there the real target cheering on their own
[55:48.200 --> 55:52.440]  destruction just like republicans thought they'd won and defeated bill
[55:52.440 --> 55:57.840]  clinton after eight years of hell when george w got in and then he continued
[55:57.840 --> 56:07.760]  the agenda and then the democrats won after eight years of bush oh yes they
[56:07.760 --> 56:13.520]  had a big victory their football team won the super bowl brand obama and they
[56:13.520 --> 56:18.200]  giggle and laugh and talk about how he's a winner and how great it is never
[56:18.200 --> 56:22.840]  knowing they're following literal programming total and complete
[56:22.840 --> 56:28.960]  programming it's all a fraud it's declassified it's a fraud they're
[56:28.960 --> 56:41.280]  laughing at you and I expose all of this in fall of the republic we are two and
[56:41.280 --> 56:48.040]  a half days away from its release I'm gonna release it at 3 p.m. that's when
[56:48.040 --> 57:13.960]  the matinee opens when the radio show in central time at 3 p.m. coming up this

[57:45.600 --> 57:51.840]  against the globalist I know we can beat these people I know that by identifying
[57:51.840 --> 57:56.040]  them and their tricks and their scientific manipulations that if we move
[57:56.040 --> 58:02.160]  quickly we have a good chance of slowing their agenda down enough to buy us time
[58:02.160 --> 58:07.320]  to reach the critical mass we need in the future to extricate ourselves from
[58:07.320 --> 58:13.160]  this world government by having a real debate with the eugenics elite by having
[58:13.160 --> 58:18.120]  some type of treaty some type of agreement that's the only thing they
[58:18.120 --> 58:22.200]  listen to is the people rising up and being aware and addressing them on the
[58:22.200 --> 58:27.880]  facts they have no respect for us but they're beginning to have respect for

[1:00:21.560 --> 1:00:30.000]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen already into our number two here's the
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:34.040]  deal I'm gonna take your phone calls to the bottom of the hour and then if the
[1:00:34.040 --> 1:00:37.680]  water doesn't rise over Bear Creek I'm gonna news blitz through all this
[1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:44.520]  important news US attacks Iran via CIA funded jundala terror group that's just
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:49.720]  some of the news I have incredible carbon tax news the UN world government
[1:00:49.720 --> 1:00:54.320]  admits and they're already announcing they may ban soccer games public events
[1:00:54.320 --> 1:00:59.560]  air travel to be heavily curtailed it is all happening that's coming up Mike in
[1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:04.960]  California thanks for holding her on the air I was gonna bring up that I guess
[1:01:04.960 --> 1:01:09.400]  the Obama administration just like upgraded the protections for medical
[1:01:09.400 --> 1:01:17.280]  marijuana patients yeah he is doing a few little titular vestigial things
[1:01:17.280 --> 1:01:21.880]  because the 14 states at least have rebelled and the feds have lost the war
[1:01:21.880 --> 1:01:26.080]  against marijuana of course they ship the heroin and cocaine and laundered the
[1:01:26.080 --> 1:01:32.120]  money so they're losing and so yes Obama is but but he always doubles back you
[1:01:32.120 --> 1:01:36.280]  notice he's increased DEA funding and harassment funding and even allowing
[1:01:36.280 --> 1:01:40.880]  blackwater to be used but yes he he then on paper just like he announces he
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:46.080]  wants peace with Iran and then launches terror attacks inside Iran so yes he he
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:50.400]  is doing something right but at the same point in time just to send that
[1:01:50.400 --> 1:01:54.280]  signal to like the left it isn't radicalized like doesn't that kind of
[1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:56.720]  like cuz I mean that's a really like pivotal issue where if they get that
[1:01:56.720 --> 1:01:59.160]  of control you know that can reindustrialize the country with
[1:01:59.160 --> 1:02:06.920]  industrial hemp so oh no they're gonna keep growing hemp with no THC band well
[1:02:06.920 --> 1:02:10.120]  I mean but that you know they don't come in they're gonna let people smoke their
[1:02:10.120 --> 1:02:15.720]  minds into 10 buck to like touch that's a pivotal issue like that you know
[1:02:15.720 --> 1:02:18.120]  doesn't that mean that they're like if they're kind of like opening themselves
[1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:20.680]  up on that front doesn't that mean they're advancing something like a lot
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:25.960]  quicker like talking about that the climate treaty the Copenhagen Treaty
[1:02:25.960 --> 1:02:30.360]  we're talking about yeah any excerpts from it yeah listen I appreciate your
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:35.280]  call that the there's been some propaganda to dealing with marijuana I
[1:02:35.280 --> 1:02:41.640]  mean George Washington grew it George Washington smoked it for stomach eggs
[1:02:41.640 --> 1:02:48.400]  apothecaries anywhere in the world you know sold different forms of cannabis
[1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:54.320]  for different medical treatments you know the old-fashioned pharmacies do
[1:02:54.320 --> 1:02:58.760]  Pond and Alchemical did want the growing of industrial hemp that has no THC in it
[1:02:58.760 --> 1:03:03.080]  can't get you high most varieties they wanted it banned because it was better
[1:03:03.080 --> 1:03:08.240]  than cotton and better than polyester and better than the oil-based products
[1:03:08.240 --> 1:03:12.280]  they had and you can grow it almost anywhere but there's also been some
[1:03:12.280 --> 1:03:16.440]  propaganda about how it's magical and could you know get us to alphas and
[1:03:16.440 --> 1:03:20.720]  turries or something you know I mean you know there's a religion around
[1:03:20.720 --> 1:03:25.120]  marijuana and smoking it and Potheds that can't get out of bed in the morning
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:29.080]  you know have this idea of how it makes them superhuman there are a lot of
[1:03:29.080 --> 1:03:32.720]  people who could smoke pot every day and you know function well good for them I
[1:03:32.720 --> 1:03:41.440]  think overall the abuse of anything is bad I don't think it's as bad as alcohol
[1:03:41.440 --> 1:03:51.840]  but that's just one of the few promises that Obama is halfway keeping
[1:03:51.840 --> 1:04:03.360]  it's just that I get a lot of phone calls saying the answer is marijuana no
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:06.240]  the answer is getting up off our butts and getting involved in informing our
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:10.840]  fellow citizens about every issue including hemp and the answer is
[1:04:10.840 --> 1:04:16.320]  realizing that we're in the eugenics wars and that our society is under major
[1:04:16.320 --> 1:04:25.120]  crisis that is the answer in our society we're gonna break them back and go to a

[1:04:35.880 --> 1:04:40.880]  get into all this cap and trade news that again I've been mentioning to
[1:04:40.880 --> 1:04:48.800]  everybody as well they may have to ban the 2010 soccer World Cup because the
[1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:53.000]  greenhouse gas emissions will soar yes plants will get so much carbon dioxide

[1:08:20.280 --> 1:08:25.480]  travel and to ban air traffic headline London Guardian he must agree to halt
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:30.200]  deforestation and curtail air travel now if the Copenhagen summit is to
[1:08:30.200 --> 1:08:36.760]  succeed that's a London Guardian headline notice how they put deforestation
[1:08:36.760 --> 1:08:40.640]  which sounds reasonable we don't want to cut down all the trees with restricting
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:47.400]  air travel and I have Reuters saying they may ban the World Cup see you're
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:51.280]  going to be prisoners they state folks when I tell you that we're going into
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:56.360]  something that makes malice China and Nazi Germany look like a tea party look
[1:08:56.360 --> 1:09:02.440]  like a cakewalk folks I'm not kidding I got a gut up every night I don't know
[1:09:02.440 --> 1:09:07.120]  what it is but everybody always talks about in philosophy and literature and
[1:09:07.120 --> 1:09:10.720]  in psychology that you know when you're real reflective it was like one o'clock
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:19.960]  in the morning I finished reading an excellent science fiction novel that
[1:09:19.960 --> 1:09:25.960]  was all about eugenics world government social engineering called the Endless
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:33.080]  War written in 1974 the year I was born no doubt this guy I'm gonna see if he's
[1:09:33.080 --> 1:09:37.320]  still alive wrote a book a few years ago see if you can get that author on and he
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:41.120]  knew everything about eugenics everything about how the UN would have a
[1:09:41.120 --> 1:09:46.120]  planetary government in his book by 2007 where everything is on your carbon
[1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:52.760]  credits and on your calories and they take all your kids at birth I mean it's
[1:09:52.760 --> 1:09:59.320]  just hellish but then of course we post an article today that has links to the
[1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:09.960]  PDF file of the 1964 book that's in my stack where the club of Rome made up of
[1:10:09.960 --> 1:10:18.800]  high UN officials called for making man the enemy and basically completely
[1:10:18.800 --> 1:10:24.720]  destroying society and exterminating everyone God it's just hellish it's just
[1:10:24.720 --> 1:10:31.080]  hellish but the issue is I'm in the airport last Wednesday flying out of lax
[1:10:31.080 --> 1:10:37.080]  my plane stuck for five hours it's delayed for five hours so I walk into a
[1:10:37.080 --> 1:10:44.040]  bookstore and I pick up because they had it was it was recommended by the
[1:10:44.040 --> 1:10:47.720]  bookstore a little card saying this is the book that starship troopers was
[1:10:47.720 --> 1:10:52.760]  really based on according to the German filmmaker it's partially based on
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:58.720]  Robert Heinlein's Starship troopers but but mainly based on this and boy was it
[1:10:58.720 --> 1:11:04.920]  but you see whoever reviewed the book was actually wrong because this book was
[1:11:04.920 --> 1:11:11.280]  no doubt influenced by Starship troopers I don't know I work so much that I might
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:15.920]  read five science fiction books a year instead of one a week like I did a long
[1:11:15.920 --> 1:11:29.080]  time ago a long time ago when I thought work in 10 hours a day was a lot but
[1:11:30.120 --> 1:11:35.000]  there was eugenics in the Wall Street Journal carbon tax stuff was in there so
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:39.720]  the point is I randomly walked into a bookstore bought a science fiction book
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:53.440]  out of the fiction section the forever war am I getting the title wrong you know
[1:11:53.440 --> 1:11:56.480]  I can remember every detail of the book but with the title we just search engine
[1:11:56.480 --> 1:12:00.920]  forever war for me and then later I'm gonna play the clip of Lord Stern
[1:12:00.920 --> 1:12:04.240]  calling for global taxes and global government that's what they had on screen
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:23.200]  just now and yeah the forever war 1974 science fiction novel by Joe Haldeman is
[1:12:23.200 --> 1:12:28.400]  how you pronounce it Halderman reading that from across the room on the
[1:12:28.400 --> 1:12:35.360]  computer screen the point is is that anybody with an IQ above a hundred who
[1:12:35.360 --> 1:12:41.120]  does done any research in fiction or nonfiction or history knows eugenics runs
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:46.040]  the whole show that's why every award-winning science fiction book I
[1:12:46.040 --> 1:12:51.120]  read whether it's by Arthur C. Clarke who's for eugenics forced implantable
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:13:00.600]  chips total world government or this writer who's clearly not for it
[1:13:01.920 --> 1:13:06.920]  doesn't matter every book I read is about it I mean I just want to point out
[1:13:06.920 --> 1:13:10.200]  here everybody's starting to talk about how I'm the guy that's exposed eugenics
[1:13:10.200 --> 1:13:14.320]  and suddenly eugenics is being discussed everywhere and people point back at
[1:13:14.320 --> 1:13:21.640]  the end game it's like I went to Niagara Falls and went look a waterfall everybody's
[1:13:21.640 --> 1:13:27.280]  like oh he discovered Niagara Falls it's like I walk outside and go look the sun
[1:13:27.280 --> 1:13:36.280]  everyone's like Alex Jones has discovered the sun I've done nothing I've got in this
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:41.400]  office well over a hundred textbooks calling for your extermination calling
[1:13:41.400 --> 1:13:46.120]  for breaking up our families calling for year-round school year to break up the
[1:13:46.120 --> 1:13:51.760]  family it's all happening now I mean don't you understand it's real I know a
[1:13:51.760 --> 1:13:55.120]  lot of people deep down are scared of this information so you're gonna laugh at
[1:13:55.120 --> 1:13:59.120]  me and say oh I'm just fair mongering folks I don't have the intellect to
[1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:03.560]  describe how bad it is okay I don't have any idea how bad it is it's always
[1:14:03.560 --> 1:14:07.920]  worse than I thought it's always further along than I thought I now question
[1:14:07.920 --> 1:14:12.200]  reality itself God only knows what's really going on in this planet we're
[1:14:12.200 --> 1:14:18.200]  only blasting through space it 20 something thousand miles an hour I
[1:14:18.200 --> 1:14:22.800]  forget I got it right last week when my memory told me you could fit over a
[1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:30.160]  million earths in the Sun 3,000 earths in Jupiter
[1:14:30.160 --> 1:14:36.400]  good guys Google for me earth speed orbiting the Sun I want to say 23,000
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:46.800]  miles an hour 22,000 miles an hour no that's the earth spin there's I forget
[1:14:46.800 --> 1:14:52.600]  see all these numbers just jumbled together I can get the general facts but
[1:14:52.760 --> 1:15:00.320]  are we going around the Sun at several million miles an hour the point is who
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:04.280]  knows what's really going on but I can't even get the public to admit there's a
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:07.840]  planetary government when the planetary government is announcing itself
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:14.880]  blowing trumpets announcing the supreme grand world government of eugenics for
[1:15:14.880 --> 1:15:20.520]  eugenics and biogenics we are going to imprison you all and lock you down with
[1:15:20.520 --> 1:15:24.760]  ID cards your children are being trained for this already under the carbon regime
[1:15:24.760 --> 1:15:31.440]  you will all be complete slaves we're going to break up your families I mean
[1:15:31.440 --> 1:15:35.480]  I can't even get the public to admit that and then it just goes on and on and
[1:15:35.480 --> 1:15:42.240]  on and on and cancer viruses and the vaccines and all the insanity
[1:15:45.560 --> 1:15:52.160]  okay got it all wrong earth scientists question at what speed is the earth orbit
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:16:09.120]  around the Sun answer at 67,000 miles per hour 670,000 miles an hour we got a
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:19.560]  close orbit around the Sun and then how fast is the earth itself rotate I got
[1:16:19.560 --> 1:16:24.840]  this 22,000 number in my head 23,000 number I know the space shuttle I've
[1:16:24.840 --> 1:16:32.560]  read orbits the earth at that speed normally earth's earth's rotation speed
[1:16:32.560 --> 1:16:39.800]  I don't know I'm just addicted to this type of stuff I'm sorry I'm not addicted
[1:16:39.800 --> 1:16:52.800]  what you know my gosh he's on a mission Brett Favre throws cannonball football
[1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:58.560]  passes I'm sorry man I'm in the middle of a galactic star system here I mean you
[1:16:58.560 --> 1:17:05.880]  know the rotation speed starts at zero at either geographic pole so it's
[1:17:05.880 --> 1:17:14.280]  different speeds at different places on the planet obviously so it's all a big
[1:17:14.280 --> 1:17:19.080]  mathematic equation so it's kind of like it's like sound of speed sound speed
[1:17:19.080 --> 1:17:28.520]  the the speed of sound depends how high you are in the atmosphere so I guess how
[1:17:28.520 --> 1:17:35.080]  fast the earth rotates is a question depending on where you are on the earth
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:46.080]  obviously it reaches its maximum about 1038 miles per hour that's the moon
[1:17:46.080 --> 1:17:52.080]  whatever we're not meant to know such things I just know the shuttle flies
[1:17:52.080 --> 1:17:59.200]  around the earth at over 20,000 miles an hour I know I've seen that number you
[1:17:59.200 --> 1:18:06.560]  know in orbit it's just orbiting at that speed without acceleration all I want is
[1:18:06.560 --> 1:18:12.520]  for people to get blasted by the size and scope and grandeur of consciousness
[1:18:12.520 --> 1:18:19.040]  and being alive on terra firma that's all I want and then to realize that we're
[1:18:19.040 --> 1:18:23.400]  having our whole future robbed by a bunch of murderous scientists who are on
[1:18:23.400 --> 1:18:28.320]  power trips and I want you to make a decision about what you want if you want
[1:18:28.320 --> 1:18:33.360]  to be injected with cancer viruses then you want to only have one child to start
[1:18:33.360 --> 1:18:36.880]  with and then no children later for most people if you want a planetary
[1:18:36.880 --> 1:18:40.400]  government the taxes and regulates everywhere you go and do if you want to
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:46.840]  be a prisoner then by all means support it and and Rob Jacobson was that whole
[1:18:46.840 --> 1:18:51.560]  foods they had that Newsweek cover the case for killing granny and he knows the
[1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:54.200]  girl at the counter and he said look at this and she said I think it's a good idea
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:57.720]  to kill granny and he said are you serious she said yes we need to get rid of
[1:18:57.720 --> 1:19:01.200]  humans we're parasite and he said but they want to kill you too and she said

[1:19:05.000 --> 1:19:10.000]  save the earth you know I I think I need to be killed and she wasn't joking

[1:25:13.400 --> 1:25:19.800]  we're all the honest world to you Michael in Minnesota you're on the air go
[1:25:19.800 --> 1:25:25.240]  ahead hi Alex thank you for taking my call I want to stay on the topics that
[1:25:25.240 --> 1:25:29.400]  you brought up first on water you wouldn't believe the amount of chemicals
[1:25:29.400 --> 1:25:35.400]  that they are buying at the city level to put in our water oh Austin buys we've
[1:25:35.400 --> 1:25:39.760]  been there they gave us the documents millions of dollars a year and Austin
[1:25:39.760 --> 1:25:44.160]  puts over 200 chemicals in the water some cities 300 when you hear the word
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:52.200]  fluoride it means literal toxic waste is dumped we pay like it's gold for the
[1:25:52.200 --> 1:25:57.080]  toxic waste from the chemical plants and then it goes in our water literally you
[1:25:57.080 --> 1:26:00.800]  could go to public works and get a the bid sheet so where they buy this stuff
[1:26:00.800 --> 1:26:04.880]  and you can see how many times they buy and put in the water no I know it's
[1:26:04.880 --> 1:26:09.640]  on lead would they pay to put lead mercury arsenic everything in there it's
[1:26:09.640 --> 1:26:14.240]  it's it's it's unspeakable what's more they raise the levy fee for the water
[1:26:14.240 --> 1:26:18.200]  every year because the cost of these chemical here's an example natural gas
[1:26:18.200 --> 1:26:24.480]  has been down from just some I forget the exact calculation something like
[1:26:24.480 --> 1:26:32.440]  $18 per thousand cubic feet British standard down to like $3 and but but
[1:26:32.440 --> 1:26:36.080]  guess what it doesn't matter of natural gas has gone down almost 90% in price
[1:26:36.080 --> 1:26:41.200]  people pay more for it in Texas it's all just part of raping and cheating just
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:46.560]  like Enron did I'm telling you folks corruption has just attacked on all
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:51.360]  fronts what's more than I wouldn't be surprised to see the H1N1 vaccine
[1:26:51.360 --> 1:26:55.280]  turned up in the water table as Prozac is already turned up in the water table
[1:26:55.280 --> 1:27:00.440]  especially up here in Minneapolis well it hasn't just turned up AP has had to
[1:27:00.440 --> 1:27:03.920]  report that it's turned up in water supplies that don't have sewage going
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:08.680]  into it it's going it's being added to the water and it's some type of generic
[1:27:08.680 --> 1:27:13.360]  mass chemical that's being added a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and it's
[1:27:13.360 --> 1:27:17.480]  been found in the Dallas water supply and other water supplies at many times
[1:27:17.480 --> 1:27:23.600]  higher than could be from sewage runoff they're putting it in the water as the
[1:27:23.600 --> 1:27:27.400]  Japanese government has suggested and has the media is now calling for putting
[1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:33.200]  prozac in the water and statins well they already put fluoride folks
[1:27:33.200 --> 1:27:40.000]  well I'm telling you it's insane now on top of that we have this new outdoor
[1:27:40.000 --> 1:27:44.040]  twin stadium that we just built in Minneapolis right next to a plastic
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:48.200]  garbage burner which they want to put up another they want to burn another
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:53.560]  225 million tons of plastic which creates dioxin in the fumes out of the
[1:27:53.560 --> 1:27:59.920]  stack which will be blowing right over the stadium now the people who own the
[1:27:59.920 --> 1:28:04.480]  burner have offered the north of neighborhood association $100,000 a
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:07.660]  year in a good neighbor fund in order for the neighborhood support of this
[1:28:07.660 --> 1:28:14.080]  project so come to the ballpark have a hot dog have a drink give your kids
[1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:21.480]  cancer it's just incredibly cruel well see that's the thing is they're banning
[1:28:21.480 --> 1:28:25.720]  literally they're gonna put taxes of 50% on coal plants that are almost
[1:28:25.720 --> 1:28:30.160]  completely clean all you have coming out of the smokestack with the scrubbers
[1:28:30.160 --> 1:28:36.520]  is water vapor but Al Gore has his camera crews go out and shoot video and I've
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:41.400]  done this for a film coming out I show how on a hot day the same power plant
[1:28:41.400 --> 1:28:45.160]  you can't even see the vapor coming out because it's hot the stuff come you know
[1:28:45.160 --> 1:28:48.840]  the water vapor coming out is hot the carbon dioxide water vapor coming out is
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:54.760]  hot and the outside air is hot so you can't see it but you know it's just
[1:28:54.760 --> 1:29:00.560]  barely a miss coming out the very top but one on a cold day it looks like you
[1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:04.320]  know the whole forest is on fire just blasting and they show that to school
[1:29:04.320 --> 1:29:09.920]  kids and say look at the smoke look at the pollution it's going to kill you so
[1:29:09.920 --> 1:29:16.320]  what they do is they tack something that isn't bad but then they legalize these
[1:29:16.320 --> 1:29:21.240]  plastic incinerators and others saying oh we can't let bury this which is
[1:29:21.240 --> 1:29:26.440]  harmless we've got to burn it knowing it hurts people and they've got a bunch of
[1:29:26.440 --> 1:29:31.080]  others sit like like they're burning all these forms of toxic waste now in
[1:29:31.080 --> 1:29:34.920]  towns and burning all the old chemical weapons supplies and then they allow
[1:29:34.920 --> 1:29:39.520]  that with special government permits to be put in the atmosphere because it does
[1:29:39.520 --> 1:29:45.200]  kill us anything that hurts us is allowed anything that doesn't hurt us as
[1:29:45.200 --> 1:29:52.640]  fast this is the sickening environmentalist way we're on the March the

[1:33:08.520 --> 1:33:35.160]  don't like this music it's like throwing water on the witch in the
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:51.600]  wizard of Oz. Oh man we play that song and my 20-month-old toddler just dances
[1:33:51.600 --> 1:34:00.660]  around like wild she kind of headbanks to that like the head up and down it's
[1:34:00.660 --> 1:34:04.360]  really excited during their snuffle she likes the German version even more than
[1:34:04.360 --> 1:34:12.040]  English one by the way I meant to play this a few months ago and Burma's just
[1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:19.720]  pointed it out to me so I'm gonna play it right now I remember when I first got
[1:34:19.720 --> 1:34:29.040]  on air 14 years ago I learned that in San Antonio and in Houston as well as
[1:34:29.040 --> 1:34:35.320]  Minneapolis, Indiana and Miami, Florida back then before the internet had a lot
[1:34:35.320 --> 1:34:40.040]  of information on it I was sent a lot of trade publications because I-35 is one
[1:34:40.040 --> 1:34:45.680]  of the biggest trucker routes and also had a lot of IT technology people in it
[1:34:45.680 --> 1:34:50.040]  and so they hear me talk about Big Brother and they'd send me industry
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:56.040]  publications where they were bragging about it you know this was before Google
[1:34:56.040 --> 1:35:03.520]  this was the Yahoo days and I would get all of this material and so I knew
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:08.480]  about face scanning cameras up in many areas of the country scanning everyone's
[1:35:08.480 --> 1:35:17.440]  faces in 1995 I knew in 1996 that they had license plate reading cameras up
[1:35:17.440 --> 1:35:21.840]  everywhere that read everyone's cars as you go down the highway but they didn't
[1:35:21.840 --> 1:35:24.320]  want to announce it then even though they could have solved a lot of crimes
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:28.480]  with it they didn't want the public to know about it just like they didn't
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.400]  want you to know under federal law in 1996 all cell phones were tracking you
[1:35:32.400 --> 1:35:37.160]  in live time the police could dial a number turn the phone on even when it's
[1:35:37.160 --> 1:35:40.920]  off and listen to you that's now been all over the news they've introduced it
[1:35:40.920 --> 1:35:45.640]  to the slaves explained it to you but I want you to think about what this
[1:35:45.640 --> 1:35:50.800]  technology can do in the hands of a tyranny which this is a tyranny and
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:54.360]  then I'm gonna get into the global carbon tax tyranny the ultimate tyranny
[1:35:54.360 --> 1:35:59.080]  that's gonna make you all criminals and you a lot of you are going to be going
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:02.720]  to prison and you're gonna be sterilized you're gonna be killed folks I'm not
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:07.560]  kidding I mean these people are vicious and all the good old boy cops who
[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:11.280]  driving around with their mustaches and their sunglasses and they like going
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:15.160]  hunting and they like going to the bar and hey I can go in the park and laudate
[1:36:15.160 --> 1:36:23.840]  Target and tell you who's got an arrest warrant I can go to all these different
[1:36:23.840 --> 1:36:28.520]  places and I can stop the criminals but then you notice and I can tell if somebody
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:34.360]  doesn't have their insurance in and I can tell if somebody but see then they
[1:36:34.360 --> 1:36:37.840]  can tell if you've got your child out too late they're gonna take your children
[1:36:37.840 --> 1:36:43.040]  if you have your three-year-old out past dark they're already setting up
[1:36:43.040 --> 1:36:48.600]  checkpoints in Arkansas you name it Oklahoma where adults are stopped in
[1:36:48.600 --> 1:36:51.360]  broad daylight and ask where they're driving I can play of those clips from
[1:36:51.360 --> 1:36:56.120]  the news saying it's good they're gonna track with smart refrigerators
[1:36:56.120 --> 1:36:59.640]  everything you eat you're then gonna have a social worker visit saying you're
[1:36:59.640 --> 1:37:03.200]  not feeding your children healthily if your child's one pound overweight they're
[1:37:03.200 --> 1:37:06.840]  gonna be taken this is all being announced they started with 2,000 homes a
[1:37:06.840 --> 1:37:10.520]  year ago now it's 20,000 homes in England children at birth have cameras
[1:37:10.520 --> 1:37:15.080]  watching them in the family home permanently they're announcing the big
[1:37:15.080 --> 1:37:18.600]  dormitories to start raising the children the year-round school I mean
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:22.400]  it's all gonna be phased in very quickly now it's not gonna change slowly over
[1:37:22.400 --> 1:37:26.720]  every decade now all that was the preparatory phase you know that was
[1:37:26.720 --> 1:37:31.080]  gutting the hog chopping it up now they've roasted it they've you know they've
[1:37:31.080 --> 1:37:35.000]  made the different dishes they've set the table everybody's sitting down now at
[1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:41.160]  the table and now it's time to eat they've prepared the supper now it's time
[1:37:41.160 --> 1:37:48.720]  to eat and we're for dinner we're being absorbed by the predator clash humans
[1:37:48.720 --> 1:37:53.140]  are predators and we have an aberrant subgroup of psychopathic elitist control
[1:37:53.140 --> 1:37:57.560]  freaks who set up a predatory psychopathic control grid to have their
[1:37:57.560 --> 1:38:01.280]  way with us and they've got all these cops that are ready to billy club women
[1:38:01.280 --> 1:38:05.440]  for not even protesting in Pittsburgh old ladies are attacked with police dogs
[1:38:05.440 --> 1:38:08.680]  coming out of stores with shopping bags in their hands the cops say no one
[1:38:08.680 --> 1:38:12.520]  while on the street sound cannons hitting nine-year-olds with footballs in
[1:38:12.520 --> 1:38:17.360]  their hands I'm sorry the cops are ready under mass mind control under mob
[1:38:17.360 --> 1:38:20.240]  psychology to do whatever they're told they'll eat their guts and ask for
[1:38:20.240 --> 1:38:23.640]  seconds they'll kill their mother and ask for seconds the Marine Corps asked
[1:38:23.640 --> 1:38:27.600]  people will you shoot your family of ordered to sir yes sir that's now being
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:32.240]  implemented not Marine Corps wide but very widely they have chance about
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:36.360]  killing small children putting candy on the ground in the schoolyard let the
[1:38:36.360 --> 1:38:40.920]  little bastards gather around mow the little bastards down the video games
[1:38:40.920 --> 1:38:45.200]  are simulated murders and killing and death and rape pure evil is rising I
[1:38:45.200 --> 1:38:54.920]  want to play you this clip here it is this is the control grid with the
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:59.120]  face cannings this is automatic license plate recognition this particular
[1:38:59.120 --> 1:39:06.640]  system is capable of capturing up to 3,000 license plates in an hour we have
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:12.120]  two forward-facing cameras and one side-facing camera the side-facing
[1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:17.240]  camera is out at a 90-degree angle and it's basically for doing parking lot
[1:39:17.240 --> 1:39:23.040]  applications I can go into a parking lot of our shopping center and drive down
[1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:27.720]  the the lanes of the parking lot and as I'm doing that I'm running every single
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:32.760]  license plate in that parking lot the forward-facing cameras one is forward
[1:39:32.760 --> 1:39:37.240]  facing to the lane to the left and one is forward-facing to the lane to the
[1:39:37.240 --> 1:39:45.000]  right and what I'm getting there is typically oncoming cars and the camera
[1:39:45.000 --> 1:39:49.480]  to the right would be either cars in the number two lane or cars that are
[1:39:49.480 --> 1:39:54.880]  parked along the side of the road so what the screen gives you here is it
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:39:59.480]  gives you an overview picture of the vehicle the software then isolates the
[1:39:59.480 --> 1:40:03.560]  license plate and it gives you the plate patch and what you see here in the
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:08.840]  yellow box above the plate patch is what the software actually read the plate
[1:40:08.840 --> 1:40:13.760]  to be at the beginning of the shift before we go out before we deploy the
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:19.280]  system we get a daily download from CPIC and from motor vehicle branch records
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:25.600]  the ICBC database that those downloads basically consist of all of the stolen
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:29.840]  vehicle license plates in British Columbia all of the vehicle license
[1:40:29.840 --> 1:40:34.360]  plates associated to uninsured vehicles license plates associated to
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:40.480]  unlicensed drivers and license plates associated to uninsured vehicles but
[1:40:40.480 --> 1:40:43.760]  anytime a vehicle with the BC license plate comes into the field of view of
[1:40:43.760 --> 1:40:50.480]  any of the cameras what will happen is the camera will take a picture of the
[1:40:50.480 --> 1:40:55.240]  vehicle the software itself will isolate the license plate that from that
[1:40:55.240 --> 1:40:59.360]  vehicle and it will send it into an onboard computer that onboard computer
[1:40:59.360 --> 1:41:06.760]  has the the hot lists that uploaded into it if there is a match from the
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:11.000]  photograph against any of the vehicles that are in the hot list then we get an
[1:41:11.000 --> 1:41:16.800]  audible alarm here on the computer screen so one of the other applications for
[1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:22.200]  this system is to frequently check parking lots for vehicles that are of
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:25.120]  interest to the police
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:38.040]  and we have a hit on this vehicle what does it say here
[1:41:40.640 --> 1:41:45.480]  stolen from Vancouver suspect in an armed robbery well it looks like we've
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:57.080]  got our first hit of the day so we've checked the hit on this Chevy Lumina the
[1:41:57.080 --> 1:42:01.920]  stolen vehicle out of Vancouver it is confirmed stolen at this time it was
[1:42:01.920 --> 1:42:06.480]  used yesterday in an armed robbery so what we're going to do now is we're
[1:42:06.480 --> 1:42:10.200]  going to maintain observation of the vehicle we'll call in the surveillance
[1:42:10.200 --> 1:42:16.200]  team and they can have a look at it we also have alpr systems installed into
[1:42:16.200 --> 1:42:21.040]  marked cars and those marked cars will focus primarily on traffic enforcement
[1:42:21.040 --> 1:42:25.320]  responsibilities going after uninsured vehicles and prohibited drivers and
[1:42:25.320 --> 1:42:29.440]  unlicensed drivers but auto theft and traffic enforcement only scratch the
[1:42:29.440 --> 1:42:35.520]  surface of what alpr is capable of doing we also have future considerations in
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:42.920]  regards to national security sites the ports the airports the Olympic games
[1:42:42.920 --> 1:42:50.040]  that are coming up we've got counter terrorism and organized crime alpr is
[1:42:50.040 --> 1:43:00.400]  going to revolutionize the way we police in North America you bet it is now you
[1:43:00.400 --> 1:43:06.640]  understand what the no-fly list is about and they've told you if you have bad
[1:43:06.640 --> 1:43:10.200]  credit you're gonna be on the no-fly list that means a no-gun buy list no
[1:43:10.200 --> 1:43:16.320]  judge no jury they're gonna leave the robbers the murderers the killers alone
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:21.600]  that they'll have a few of those on the news but the local squad cars aren't
[1:43:21.600 --> 1:43:28.200]  gonna be allowed to do anything about them it's the profiled milk cows they're
[1:43:28.200 --> 1:43:32.880]  gonna want and because you're a person of interest you're not gonna have a
[1:43:32.880 --> 1:43:38.160]  right to travel go anywhere do anything and under carbon tax they're gonna
[1:43:38.160 --> 1:43:45.760]  regulate and control society even more and of course they show you oh the
[1:43:45.760 --> 1:43:51.800]  armed robbers see it works so good as if armed robbers don't change their
[1:43:51.800 --> 1:43:54.960]  license plates as if somebody that steals your car doesn't just take it to a
[1:43:54.960 --> 1:43:58.840]  chop shop as if when your car gets stolen the police will even come out and
[1:43:58.840 --> 1:44:04.000]  do a report I've had my car stolen twice they laughed at me
[1:44:05.080 --> 1:44:08.840]  imagine what Hitler would have done with his system in Nazi Germany and
[1:44:08.840 --> 1:44:13.520]  that's what's gonna happen here and they're gonna give you no quarter and
[1:44:13.520 --> 1:44:19.360]  they're gonna hunt you down period this is the control grid this is why the
[1:44:19.360 --> 1:44:24.760]  elite are so arrogant and they'd laugh at me ten years ago about this and now
[1:44:24.760 --> 1:44:31.360]  it's in everywhere bottom line okay let's go to Gallo in North Carolina
[1:44:31.360 --> 1:44:38.080]  thanks for holding Gallo hello Alex yes or go ahead thanks for taking my call
[1:44:38.080 --> 1:44:41.200]  I just had a quick question for you I've actually only been listening to your
[1:44:41.200 --> 1:44:45.440]  show for about two weeks and I'm trying to educate myself here I just have a
[1:44:45.440 --> 1:44:49.360]  quick question what what can I do to make a change and we'll kind of
[1:44:49.360 --> 1:44:54.400]  different information can I look up to to get more educated to know what's going
[1:44:54.400 --> 1:45:00.000]  on the police have been trained and created by the military industrial
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.400]  complex itself an enforcement arm of the offshore banking eugenicist
[1:45:04.400 --> 1:45:16.720]  eugenicist crime syndicate and the whole government is there to basically
[1:45:16.720 --> 1:45:22.840]  prey on the public and we have to have a total revolution of awakening against
[1:45:22.840 --> 1:45:26.640]  this system and completely remove the criminal system or we have no hope
[1:45:26.640 --> 1:45:32.040]  they're running a military operation of sucking off of us of milking us and
[1:45:32.040 --> 1:45:36.680]  they're not gonna back off until we get really aggressive and are aware of what's
[1:45:36.680 --> 1:45:42.680]  happening so just warn everybody you know explain to them about how both
[1:45:42.680 --> 1:45:48.680]  presidents both parties are puppets and just have a basic awakening that we're
[1:45:48.680 --> 1:45:53.360]  literally living in something like a matrix of false information and
[1:45:53.360 --> 1:46:01.560]  propaganda start an access TV show put my daily radio TV show on your local
[1:46:01.560 --> 1:46:06.240]  access station a lot of folks downloaded a prison planet TV and do that put my
[1:46:06.240 --> 1:46:12.080]  films on start your own local radio show start a newsletter get involved
[1:46:12.080 --> 1:46:21.640]  because we have to change our priorities from just working and leisure to the
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:26.640]  main focus of our lives fighting this tyranny and it's going to become more
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:30.840]  and more clear to everybody that fighting this tyranny is all that matters
[1:46:30.840 --> 1:46:36.480]  it's going to get worse and worse by increments but the increments are going
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:41.040]  to get closer and closer together and as you come down to the end game
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:48.720]  everything is accelerating I'm just writing everything down I appreciate it
[1:46:48.720 --> 1:46:52.560]  I just you know it's been making me think a lot my mind is just so much
[1:46:52.560 --> 1:46:58.320]  information but I appreciate it Alex and I'm sure the American people appreciate
[1:46:58.320 --> 1:47:03.080]  what you're doing well I appreciate you for holding Gallo to talk about that but
[1:47:03.080 --> 1:47:07.400]  you have begun the beginning you're changing your priorities you're looking
[1:47:07.400 --> 1:47:11.120]  around you you're studying propaganda around you you're questioning
[1:47:11.120 --> 1:47:16.880]  everything and that will lead you to the answers we just have to get people to
[1:47:16.880 --> 1:47:20.840]  stop looking at the ground and look up and around them God bless you good to
[1:47:20.840 --> 1:47:26.400]  hear from you let's talk to Marty in California then Bill Robert Brian and
[1:47:26.400 --> 1:47:31.240]  others go ahead Marty hello Alex how are you hats off hats off to you what's
[1:47:31.240 --> 1:47:35.840]  going on I've got two quickie questions and one quickie statement if I may
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:41.040]  make your statement if the Copenhagen Treaty is signed this coming early
[1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:47.040]  December by Obama and then in early January if the California American
[1:47:47.040 --> 1:47:51.440]  courts find that Obama's Kenya's birth certificate is valid and he is removed
[1:47:51.440 --> 1:47:55.600]  from the office does that make Obama's signature on the Copenhagen Treaty null
[1:47:55.600 --> 1:48:01.640]  and void and if so do we get more pre-picked candidates to vote for and
[1:48:01.640 --> 1:48:06.400]  then lastly my statement is on this Obama's personal attorney a guy named
[1:48:06.400 --> 1:48:10.120]  Robert Bauer I just can't help but notice that's the original last name of
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:14.800]  the Rothschilds I wonder if there's any connection there well we know Obama's
[1:48:14.800 --> 1:48:18.880]  visited with Lord Rothschild so Arnold Schwarzenegger and we know they're one
[1:48:18.880 --> 1:48:22.120]  of the wealthiest families on the planet so we know there's a connection right
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:29.440]  there but on your point about the Copenhagen Treaty coming up in December
[1:48:29.440 --> 1:48:37.960]  that I'm gonna be covering here in a moment that treaty is already being
[1:48:37.960 --> 1:48:45.040]  ratified they already have a copy of the treaty and the giant behemoth carbon
[1:48:45.040 --> 1:48:49.760]  tax bill that's passed the house is set to pass in the next month and a half
[1:48:49.760 --> 1:48:59.200]  according to Senate leaders in the US Senate and so it ties into that and so
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:08.040]  the the signing of the treaty because he is a executive doesn't bring force
[1:49:08.040 --> 1:49:11.040]  into it though the bureaucracy will still follow the president's orders
[1:49:11.040 --> 1:49:16.920]  unconstitutionally what what you'll have to do is get the Congress to repeal the
[1:49:16.920 --> 1:49:22.520]  treaty but instead let's just beat that treaty but no the silver bullet
[1:49:22.520 --> 1:49:29.480]  politically of the whole birth certificate thing I mean that's a way to
[1:49:29.480 --> 1:49:33.200]  undermine Obama and destroy his credibility on its face and because he
[1:49:33.200 --> 1:49:36.840]  is such a liar nobody believes him so I think it's credible to question the
[1:49:36.840 --> 1:49:40.520]  birth certificate but I think overall it's not one of the most damaging things
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:45.160]  to him you know the left is all scrambling right now saying oh Obama's
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:49.800]  being forced by the generals there's this Rolling Stone article that shows all
[1:49:49.800 --> 1:49:56.680]  of these military people aiming machine guns on him at one side and on and then
[1:49:56.680 --> 1:50:01.200]  on the other the Taliban aiming guns at him like he's the victim and they're
[1:50:01.200 --> 1:50:07.440]  making him do it when you because he guys a warmonger I mean it's all lies you
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:11.720]  give a peace prize to a guy who expands the wars who continues the bush torture
[1:50:11.720 --> 1:50:18.480]  the secret arrest expands it and again they want to make it all about Obama so
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:22.600]  they can build him up tearing down building up tearing down to where it
[1:50:22.600 --> 1:50:27.600]  becomes a big football game it's just elementary propaganda anything else no
[1:50:27.600 --> 1:50:31.600]  appreciate your time and I thank you very much for you do thank you I mean
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:36.720]  look folks it's so elementary I mean you got Bush senior last week calling for
[1:50:36.720 --> 1:50:41.880]  force national service giving the thousand points of light award to Obama
[1:50:41.880 --> 1:50:46.320]  they're at college station being held by the Marine Corps and Army it's one of
[1:50:46.320 --> 1:50:54.120]  the biggest officer schools in the country they love it period totally on
[1:50:54.120 --> 1:50:58.960]  America and their total traders it's a big joke it's a big they're laughing at
[1:50:58.960 --> 1:51:03.440]  the crowd it's funny to them have you ever wanted to generate your own supply
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:07.360]  of electrical power if so this is going to be the most important message you
[1:51:07.360 --> 1:51:11.480]  will ever hear solar power generators are now available from solutions from
[1:51:11.480 --> 1:51:15.000]  science in Thompson Illinois these emergency backup systems provide
[1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:18.880]  lifesaving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas generators a
[1:51:18.880 --> 1:51:23.440]  solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces electricity for free
[1:51:23.440 --> 1:51:27.480]  it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own home run
[1:51:27.480 --> 1:51:32.160]  some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling whether
[1:51:32.160 --> 1:51:36.320]  it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer
[1:51:36.320 --> 1:51:40.920]  through painful power outages again when the power goes out you'll be ready with
[1:51:40.920 --> 1:51:46.480]  a solar power generator from solution from science go to my solar backup calm

[1:54:02.000 --> 1:54:19.040]  the establishment has divided us they have
[1:54:19.040 --> 1:54:29.040]  vulcanized us along religion race ethnicity region so that while we're
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:35.720]  busy fighting with each other at each other's throats they can rule over us
[1:54:35.720 --> 1:54:41.480]  and I know that basically everyone I talked to innately understands that but
[1:54:41.480 --> 1:54:45.880]  have you really consciously looked around you and seen all the forms of
[1:54:45.880 --> 1:54:51.840]  vulcanization and a lot of it's real the elite will set different groups against
[1:54:51.840 --> 1:54:57.000]  each other and so you basically got to dislike whatever group they're using
[1:54:57.000 --> 1:55:04.680]  against you whatever group you see if you're somebody from Latin America you've
[1:55:04.680 --> 1:55:08.440]  already been enslaved by the West by the big banks you need to come in and get a
[1:55:08.440 --> 1:55:11.600]  better wage even if it's only for a few years even though it'll destroy the
[1:55:11.600 --> 1:55:18.320]  wages of that first world nation doesn't matter you individually are set
[1:55:18.320 --> 1:55:24.480]  against the once free countries and then of course the people in those Western
[1:55:24.480 --> 1:55:28.400]  nations who can think understand it's destroying the sovereignty and the wages
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:32.680]  and the culture so they get upset and so you're both being played off against
[1:55:32.680 --> 1:55:36.080]  each other meanwhile the globalists because they don't have either groups
[1:55:36.080 --> 1:55:40.400]  best interest at heart they come out winning because they don't have any
[1:55:40.400 --> 1:55:50.640]  rules see evil has that advantage and they've got the money they can issue the
[1:55:50.640 --> 1:55:55.680]  money they can issue the currency then they make us slaves to them after they
[1:55:55.680 --> 1:56:02.080]  issue themselves enough fiat money to buy the world over a hundred times this
[1:56:02.080 --> 1:56:08.080]  is what fall of the Republic covers that's why it's so important that you

[1:58:52.160 --> 1:58:56.160]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[1:58:56.160 --> 1:58:59.960]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:58:59.960 --> 1:59:04.040]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company

[1:59:12.560 --> 1:59:16.520]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:59:16.520 --> 1:59:20.920]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:24.640]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:28.760]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:59:28.760 --> 1:59:32.600]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[1:59:32.600 --> 1:59:36.080]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[2:00:32.520 --> 2:00:36.720]  it's so important I just can't believe they're actually doing it they're
[2:00:36.720 --> 2:00:40.240]  announcing they're gonna ban public gatherings they're announcing they're
[2:00:40.240 --> 2:00:45.880]  gonna quote curtail with specifics that you've got to get a government license
[2:00:45.880 --> 2:00:50.960]  showing your travel is essential and you go but that'll hurt the tourist
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:56.960]  industry the globalist just made 50 plus trillion dollars globally 23.7
[2:00:56.960 --> 2:01:02.440]  trillion of it on US taxpayers in the last 10 months don't you get it folks
[2:01:02.440 --> 2:01:05.720]  I've got Club of Rome and all their documents where they say they don't
[2:01:05.720 --> 2:01:14.720]  want us to have any industry they want a post industrial world that there was a
[2:01:14.720 --> 2:01:24.080]  Club of Rome article today I thought I printed it but it's not my stack yeah
[2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:28.680]  here it is agenda 21 the death knell of liberty it's a great article by the
[2:01:28.680 --> 2:01:32.440]  Canadian Free Press we got up on prisonplanet.com infowars.com it says
[2:01:32.440 --> 2:01:39.640]  the common enemy of humanity is man this is from the first global revolution
[2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:46.840]  1993 and then in 1960s I've got him saying this is almost the same hundreds
[2:01:46.840 --> 2:01:51.600]  of times I've read this in different permutations the common enemy of
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:56.000]  humanity is man see the elites see themselves as humanity and the rest of
[2:01:56.000 --> 2:01:59.760]  us is subhuman that that's what that little coded statement means the common
[2:01:59.760 --> 2:02:03.880]  enemy of humanity is man and searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up
[2:02:03.880 --> 2:02:10.120]  with the idea of that poll pollution the threat of global warming water
[2:02:10.120 --> 2:02:14.600]  shortages famine and the like would fit the bill the real enemy then is humanity
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:19.920]  itself see they're just making it up they came up with the idea danger
[2:02:19.920 --> 2:02:27.000]  danger will robertson democracy is no longer well suited for the task ahead
[2:02:27.000 --> 2:02:34.560]  from the club of rome's the first global revolution page 71 1993
[2:02:34.920 --> 2:02:48.200]  therefore send not to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for the John Don
[2:02:49.760 --> 2:02:56.440]  1572 means don't go looking and asking in the town who the bell tolls for who's
[2:02:56.440 --> 2:03:00.000]  gonna be hung who's gonna have the blackbirds pull their eyes out of their

[2:03:18.000 --> 2:03:22.680]  basketball team or baseball they don't get a gleam in their eye for freedom or
[2:03:22.680 --> 2:03:28.200]  to keep a little kids from drinking poison in the water on purpose all the
[2:03:28.200 --> 2:03:35.720]  intellectuals make doctor strange love jack T. Ripper jokes it's all funny it's
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:42.360]  cute the common enemy of humanity is man in searching for a new enemy deans we
[2:03:42.360 --> 2:03:46.040]  came up with the idea that population the threat of global warming and water
[2:03:46.040 --> 2:03:50.040]  shortages famine and the like would fit the bill the real enemy then is
[2:03:50.040 --> 2:03:54.560]  humanity itself democracy is no longer well suited for the task ahead from the
[2:03:54.560 --> 2:04:00.120]  club of Rome the first global revolution page 71 1993 and Richard in

[2:11:39.360 --> 2:11:45.840]  internet by Thursday we'll try to find the best in code on YouTube that somebody
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:51.680]  with a director channel has and linked to that but we won't be able to make
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:55.640]  films of this caliber in the future unless we get the financial support we
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:12:00.160]  got it with Obama deception so I took the extra profits from that and opt the
[2:12:00.160 --> 2:12:04.960]  production quality on this it's an even beggar gamble I don't care I'd give my
[2:12:04.960 --> 2:12:09.440]  life to stop the new world order right now if I thought that was needed I am
[2:12:09.440 --> 2:12:17.240]  committed I know there's no future unless we do this but YouTube isn't crisp
[2:12:17.240 --> 2:12:22.880]  and clear it's getting a little bit better prisonplanet.tv is I mean it is
[2:12:22.880 --> 2:12:28.240]  DVD quality now if you don't have a super high-powered connection that's okay
[2:12:28.240 --> 2:12:32.840]  we've got it in super high quality high quality medium quality and then even the
[2:12:32.840 --> 2:12:39.720]  small file looks a lot better than YouTube and Google we got a Divx file
[2:12:39.720 --> 2:12:45.440]  that this time encoded better than our medium quality so it's made for those
[2:12:45.440 --> 2:12:49.800]  that know this stuff to be able to put it on regular computer disk and almost
[2:12:49.800 --> 2:12:55.120]  all new DVD players last few years play Divx so you can say you can just give
[2:12:55.120 --> 2:12:58.840]  these 20 cent disk is what a regular disk is not a DVD it's a desk a regular
[2:12:58.840 --> 2:13:02.880]  desk you can give this to people and it'll play on most players just put a
[2:13:02.880 --> 2:13:07.120]  sticker on there or tell them hey if this doesn't play on yours it's because
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:12.560]  you don't have a Divx DVD player it'll play on your computer the point is
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:19.040]  prisonplanet.tv is an arsenal of resistance to this tyranny and we want
[2:13:19.040 --> 2:13:22.920]  everybody to go get the 595 monthly membership that pays for our bandwidth
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:29.480]  you can share your passcode with six people but if they share it you won't
[2:13:29.480 --> 2:13:35.840]  be able to simultaneously get on one passcode allows six computers to attach
[2:13:35.840 --> 2:13:40.040]  to it at one time it said at six right now right we had it said at nine it was
[2:13:40.040 --> 2:13:46.920]  crashing our servers right Matt what is the server set at right now guys how
[2:13:46.920 --> 2:13:53.680]  many how many how many computers can it can I sign on it is it is six okay yeah
[2:13:53.680 --> 2:13:56.000]  it's okay that's why I was just double-checking we hadn't changed it I
[2:13:56.000 --> 2:14:00.720]  told him turn it up to like nine and it was even with our big CDNs it was too
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:05.440]  expensive I have a $400,000 a year bandwidth bill it's actually more than
[2:14:05.440 --> 2:14:09.880]  that listen the the issue here is ladies and gentlemen and I'm gonna go to
[2:14:09.880 --> 2:14:16.600]  Lindsay Williams here is that this is a big deal this is important okay I wanted
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:22.720]  to introduce Lindsay Williams with the fact that Bilderberg in 2008 Jim Tucker
[2:14:22.720 --> 2:14:27.880]  and my sources as well as well as Daniel Estolin all reported that the
[2:14:27.880 --> 2:14:31.640]  Bilderberg group was planning to slash oil prices by at least half that would
[2:14:31.640 --> 2:14:37.320]  have been $75 Lindsay Williams who did work for Atlantic
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:42.720]  Richfield and other big oil companies as a high-level minister he was a ground
[2:14:42.720 --> 2:14:45.280]  level minister but they brought him in to be part of the board meetings that's
[2:14:45.280 --> 2:14:49.520]  pretty standard in many cases and he heard them when they found all the
[2:14:49.520 --> 2:14:53.240]  extra oil in Alaska more than Saudi Arabia he heard them say we can't pump
[2:14:53.240 --> 2:14:57.240]  this out that's now come out in the Associated Press 20 years after he broke
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:01.320]  it and wrote a best-selling book about it so he's been confirmed that's who we
[2:15:01.320 --> 2:15:05.160]  have on here who's been confirmed over and over again who we can trust who we
[2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:12.000]  know is accurate this 80 plus year old he's an 87 year old former executive I
[2:15:12.000 --> 2:15:16.600]  know who it is what company but I'm not I'm not at liberty to say but but the
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:20.560]  point is there were several companies involved three big ones I'm just gonna
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:24.240]  leave it at that because it was a joint deal a lot of times all companies a
[2:15:24.240 --> 2:15:30.120]  joint deal Lindsay put out a video that was number one on Google off and on for
[2:15:30.120 --> 2:15:35.560]  about six months so tens of millions of views conservatively they called up and
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:39.280]  said we're gonna kill you if you don't shut up you were brought into this in
[2:15:39.280 --> 2:15:43.960]  confidence don't talk about how there's plenty of oil anymore but the guy was
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:51.040]  dying thought he was dying at the time just like he Howard Hunt went public a
[2:15:51.040 --> 2:15:54.640]  year before he died thinking he was gonna die then right before he did die
[2:15:54.640 --> 2:15:59.120]  admitting he ran the opt to kill Kennedy it's now declassified basically but
[2:15:59.120 --> 2:16:03.600]  but the issue here is he thought he was gonna die and said but here's what I can
[2:16:03.600 --> 2:16:08.880]  tell you Lindsay has now talked to him he doesn't really like what's happening
[2:16:08.880 --> 2:16:12.960]  but he's still a globalist and the guy made Dysons we may be able to in the
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:17.640]  next year or so give you his name long as Lindsay sticks around and he's in great
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:23.680]  health he's a he's a old-timer himself but enough of me the point is Lindsay
[2:16:23.680 --> 2:16:28.000]  said it's a hundred and fifty dollars a barrel right now but he said within three
[2:16:28.000 --> 2:16:32.160]  months it's gonna drop below 50 everybody laughed at him because we just
[2:16:32.160 --> 2:16:34.520]  had from Bilderberg they were gonna cut it in half that would have been down to
[2:16:34.520 --> 2:16:40.160]  75 and that sounded insane back there is the prison planet article that we
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:44.120]  posted leaked agenda Bilderberg group plans economic depression and in the
[2:16:44.120 --> 2:16:48.760]  article from May 6 is just the footnote and somebody pointed out after Lindsay
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:52.720]  went public that we'd already put this intel out so see not only am I
[2:16:52.720 --> 2:16:56.040]  confirming what Lindsay said from his source we separately already had this
[2:16:56.040 --> 2:16:59.840]  but we weren't smart like Lindsay to make the prediction and pointed out this was
[2:16:59.840 --> 2:17:05.840]  just intel that we came up with so in fact there it is about the hundred fifty
[2:17:05.840 --> 2:17:12.840]  dollars a barrel and just amazing oh that's that's Watson reporting on our
[2:17:12.840 --> 2:17:16.400]  original report let me give you the original report here it is secret
[2:17:16.400 --> 2:17:24.200]  Bilderberg agenda to microchip Americans and June 10 2008 that's the
[2:17:24.200 --> 2:17:29.840]  original article that had it so so so that said Lindsay Williams will just get
[2:17:29.840 --> 2:17:32.360]  into the end of the show today because I'm going to him later and I apologize
[2:17:32.360 --> 2:17:37.200]  he is here with us but the whole global agenda is unfolding now oil went back up
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:43.640]  but Lindsay said for at least a year and for a year it was on average at about
[2:17:43.640 --> 2:17:46.120]  fifty five dollars I've done the math right around fifty five dollars and a
[2:17:46.120 --> 2:17:51.040]  barrel like he said now it's gone up to seventy six seventy nine's the high
[2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:56.680]  earlier today the trolls tried to discredit Lindsay said oh look it went
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:18:00.240]  back up no his prediction was it would go down for a year and it wasn't a
[2:18:00.240 --> 2:18:04.120]  prediction it was he was told this by an insider Lindsay we're going to break in
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:08.040]  two minutes but great to have you back with us you're breaking this news here
[2:18:08.040 --> 2:18:11.880]  we're honored to have you this guy spilt his guts as you told me during the
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:16.520]  break believing he may die anytime we're gonna get even more from a high level
[2:18:16.520 --> 2:18:18.960]  insider today thanks for breaking in here
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:23.320]  thank you Alex for allowing me the privilege of being on your show today
[2:18:23.320 --> 2:18:28.320]  Alex you realize that this is the first radio talk show that I've done in three
[2:18:28.320 --> 2:18:33.600]  months I have not done a single show with anybody in three months you'll
[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:37.520]  produce a call me back about two months ago and he said the price crude oil is
[2:18:37.520 --> 2:18:41.360]  going up Alex said would you appear on the show I said would you please give me
[2:18:41.360 --> 2:18:46.240]  a rain check I said until I know what I'm talking about until I have talked
[2:18:46.240 --> 2:18:51.280]  with the elite themselves and can tell you that I guarantee this is going to
[2:18:51.280 --> 2:18:55.240]  take place I don't want to be on your show I said please give me a rain check
[2:18:55.240 --> 2:18:58.440]  and when I know what I'm talking about instead of guessing I'll be glad to be
[2:18:58.440 --> 2:19:03.720]  there Alex Jones show today is the first show I have appeared on in three months
[2:19:03.720 --> 2:19:08.600]  and no one has ever heard the material that you're going to hear in a few
[2:19:08.600 --> 2:19:13.200]  minutes because when I got back from three months of being absent one morning
[2:19:13.200 --> 2:19:18.040]  I felt hey I should pick up the telephone call these people and ask them
[2:19:18.040 --> 2:19:23.000]  what they're doing and I did just a few days ago I picked up the phone sure
[2:19:23.000 --> 2:19:27.160]  enough he answered the phone the first time around he's over 85 years of age
[2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:33.240]  he nearly died last winter I didn't know that Alex he confessed everything now
[2:19:33.240 --> 2:19:36.840]  if you ever thought about the fact that when a person is facing a turn and
[2:19:36.840 --> 2:19:40.680]  everybody knows that graveyards out there you realize that even the elite
[2:19:40.680 --> 2:19:45.400]  themselves when they're facing such circumstances is that often times tell
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:47.680]  you things that they would never tell you otherwise
[2:19:47.680 --> 2:19:53.320]  Charlotte Isherby's father was sculling bones and confessed and repented right
[2:19:53.320 --> 2:19:57.120]  before he died of cancer and cried his guts out it's never too late there's
[2:19:57.120 --> 2:20:01.480]  like a thief on the cross pastor stay with us we're coming right back why are
[2:20:01.480 --> 2:20:05.520]  you letting that search engine spy on you spy on me yeah don't you know Google

[2:24:54.440 --> 2:24:58.520]  this segment the next completely Lindsay Williams talked to me like I'm a five
[2:24:58.520 --> 2:25:02.840]  year old they have a lot of new listeners give them the basics this insider
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:07.920]  who almost died has now given you even more information pastor Lindsay Williams
[2:25:07.920 --> 2:25:14.640]  you've got the floor Alex you're right this is not a joke this man confessed
[2:25:14.640 --> 2:25:20.440]  everything over 85 years of age almost died last winter and I have not talked
[2:25:20.440 --> 2:25:24.640]  to him for two years and two years ago he said the price of crude oil is going
[2:25:24.640 --> 2:25:29.400]  from 147 dollars to 50 dollars a barrel and everybody said you're stupid you're
[2:25:29.400 --> 2:25:32.960]  crazy your credibility is going to be destroyed if you dare give out such
[2:25:32.960 --> 2:25:38.280]  privileged information I did three months later because I have never found
[2:25:38.280 --> 2:25:41.560]  these individuals to be wrong they know what they're doing they know where
[2:25:41.560 --> 2:25:44.880]  they're going whenever they say it you can believe it's going to happen
[2:25:44.880 --> 2:25:49.300]  Wall Street couldn't take it the OPEC couldn't handle it and it went to 50
[2:25:49.300 --> 2:25:53.600]  dollars a barrel in fact it went down to 34 dollars barrels going back up to 70
[2:25:53.600 --> 2:25:57.960]  it's going to fluctuate back and forth in between there and Alex when I told
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:26:01.680]  that there was only one or two little obiti radio talk shows that would dare
[2:26:01.680 --> 2:26:06.360]  even allow me on to tell something so stupid and Wall Street even some Wall
[2:26:06.360 --> 2:26:10.160]  Street people were laughing at me and saying it'll so impact the world it
[2:26:10.160 --> 2:26:14.720]  couldn't possibly happen but Alex it happened now I said all of that to say
[2:26:14.720 --> 2:26:19.480]  this this man confessed everything he sees the graveyard you're around the
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:25.400]  corner and what you are about to hear this hour this morning is shocking I
[2:26:25.400 --> 2:26:30.200]  was stunned when this individual told me this and I'm still shaking I mean you
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:34.120]  you bound to hear it in my voice Alex I am so glad you're coming out with this
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:38.440]  new DVD I haven't seen it yet since I just got back in the office the other
[2:26:38.440 --> 2:26:42.320]  day I have not decided this idea that you were putting this out hope you've got
[2:26:42.320 --> 2:26:46.200]  to get Alex you're on your DVD because when you hear what this
[2:26:46.200 --> 2:26:51.480]  elitist told me within the past few days you're going to know that everything
[2:26:51.480 --> 2:26:56.800]  Alex Jones is saying to you is true you have got to get his DVD you must pass
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:02.240]  it out to three or four million people within the first week's time Alex I am
[2:27:02.240 --> 2:27:06.720]  so congratulated I am congratulating you to know in for what you're saying
[2:27:06.720 --> 2:27:10.000]  Lindsay I want to congratulate you and hopefully later you're gonna tell us
[2:27:10.000 --> 2:27:13.920]  about some media you put together to get your inside info out but you said he
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:19.360]  said for at least one year it would go to 50 it went to actually 32 at its low
[2:27:19.360 --> 2:27:23.400]  one time stayed around 50 for the year as you said it's gone back up a bit now
[2:27:23.400 --> 2:27:29.240]  what is going on give us the inside intel well everything you said back then
[2:27:29.240 --> 2:27:33.360]  happened exactly like you said it and everything that you're going to hear me
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:38.080]  say that he hit said in the past few days is going to happen exactly like he
[2:27:38.080 --> 2:27:42.360]  says you remember a number of years ago there was a man who wrote a book his
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:47.960]  name was quickly it was entitled tragic in hope and it came to pass exactly as
[2:27:47.960 --> 2:27:52.560]  he said it and when quickly came out with the book he was one of them he was
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:56.840]  one of the elitist himself and when it came out with the book everybody said
[2:27:56.840 --> 2:28:02.720]  quickly nobody why would you dare give out the secrets of the elite and aren't
[2:28:02.720 --> 2:28:06.360]  you afraid giving that out and quickly responded nobody's gonna believe it
[2:28:06.360 --> 2:28:11.280]  anyway now I'm going to tell you up front right now whenever I tell you the
[2:28:11.280 --> 2:28:14.520]  thing and this is so different than anything you've ever heard before this
[2:28:14.520 --> 2:28:19.080]  man gave me things that has to do with other things besides anything you even
[2:28:19.080 --> 2:28:23.080]  imagined and when you hear this I'm warning you in advance this is
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:28.440]  psychologically shaking information and you are going to have difficult time
[2:28:28.440 --> 2:28:33.560]  believing it but as I said the other one hold on Lindsay you're starting to
[2:28:33.560 --> 2:28:40.440]  freak me out you said 25 or longer ago there was oil all over Alaska you were
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:44.200]  there you said where it was at they've now had to admit that and that they're
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:48.680]  holding those reserves you wrote a best-selling book about that over and
[2:28:48.680 --> 2:28:52.760]  over again what you've said's been accurate but but then what you said two
[2:28:52.760 --> 2:28:57.600]  years ago was stunningly accurate was actually worse than what you said not to
[2:28:57.600 --> 2:29:03.960]  50 but to 32 you're telling me now this is I haven't heard this again you do
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:08.920]  just contacted us and and said I'm ready to tell you this this guy thinks he may
[2:29:08.920 --> 2:29:13.720]  die I mean compared to last time you're saying he spilt his guts so we're gonna
[2:29:13.720 --> 2:29:17.000]  go to break it's a 15-minute segment it's actually longer than that it's a
[2:29:17.000 --> 2:29:22.240]  17-minute segment you're gonna have the complete floor I want you to just roll
[2:29:22.240 --> 2:29:27.240]  through what he told you when we come back Lindsay Williams very honored he's
[2:29:27.240 --> 2:29:32.280]  breaking this here I have nothing but respect for Lindsay and his information
[2:29:32.280 --> 2:29:37.520]  has always proven to be a hundred percent dead on and so I am very upset
[2:29:37.520 --> 2:29:41.280]  about what we're about to hear I think I've got enough can imagine what it's
[2:29:41.280 --> 2:29:48.600]  gonna be because I've got the documents right over here and it's just how deep

[2:36:43.200 --> 2:36:48.120]  material this is the first show I've ever given it on you're the first one to
[2:36:48.120 --> 2:36:52.560]  know it and you'll get it know the place on the face of the earth believe me
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:37:00.000]  over 85 years of age nearly died last winter I mean Alex okay here we go you
[2:37:00.000 --> 2:37:03.480]  ready I'm just gonna give you one statement after the other and I'll
[2:37:03.480 --> 2:37:08.360]  elaborate on somewhat as we go along I'm ready said it this is completely
[2:37:08.360 --> 2:37:14.080]  different Alex me most people haven't even thought about this yet he said
[2:37:14.080 --> 2:37:21.960]  within two years you will not recognize America oh my goodness when he said that
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:26.840]  my mind went a thousand miles an hour by the way when I was in the studio the
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:32.360]  other day making these DVDs the studio owner came in and he said wait a minute
[2:37:32.360 --> 2:37:35.720]  you can't put that in he said you cut that out he said I'd be too dangerous
[2:37:35.720 --> 2:37:40.520]  even put that in in my studio and we did we cut one of our segment out because
[2:37:40.520 --> 2:37:44.120]  he said you can't make that statement he said it'll fall back on us as a studio
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:47.840]  now let me keep going here with this is like Russia it's none of the guys
[2:37:47.840 --> 2:37:51.440]  business where your video taping something in a studio but the average
[2:37:51.440 --> 2:37:57.080]  America's been programmed to be like a Soviet Nazi you you you cut out well you
[2:37:57.080 --> 2:38:00.960]  say whatever you want here you tell us what's not in the DVD Lindsay tell us
[2:38:00.960 --> 2:38:06.240]  well he said this gentleman one of them he knows everything that goes on
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:10.600]  behind closed doors you talking about the 8d10 I don't care what it is this man
[2:38:10.600 --> 2:38:14.240]  knows what it is he knows he doesn't have much more of his life he said quote
[2:38:14.240 --> 2:38:21.280]  within two years you will not recognize America and the first thing I wanted to
[2:38:21.280 --> 2:38:27.400]  know is what are you talking about he said then he said we have altered our
[2:38:27.400 --> 2:38:32.680]  timeline I'm going to put it this way the elite have altered that timeline now
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:36.520]  you remember back two years ago I said the price of crude oil is going from
[2:38:36.520 --> 2:38:42.800]  $147 to $50 a barrel he also said some other thing oh Alex I'll get into this
[2:38:42.800 --> 2:38:48.160]  as we go along he said McCain is a hollow man I did not have the slightest
[2:38:48.160 --> 2:38:51.640]  idea how important this was and I'm going to tell you in a few moments this
[2:38:51.640 --> 2:38:57.480]  Obama guy is in trouble the elite have altered their timeline after two of the
[2:38:57.480 --> 2:39:03.600]  year he said again after two years you oh Alex please I hope every one of your
[2:39:03.600 --> 2:39:08.200]  people out there write this down and when you think about buying Alex Jones new
[2:39:08.200 --> 2:39:13.760]  DVD don't you hesitate one second because here it is right here this
[2:39:13.760 --> 2:39:20.440]  gentleman said after two years you will be so poor you will not be able to
[2:39:20.440 --> 2:39:26.200]  rebel Alex I was stunned I mean this man went on and on and on with what
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:31.200]  they're doing why would you be so poor after two years he kept using the
[2:39:31.200 --> 2:39:39.680]  expression two years they have a new timeline you know people can stand
[2:39:39.680 --> 2:39:43.120]  outside and watch these people as they go in and you've done a marvelous job of
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:48.480]  telling what you see whenever they go into these meetings no way in this
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:53.280]  world could a person ever talk to one of them himself unless he was under this
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:58.360]  particular situation with this man this age and his physical condition as it is
[2:39:58.360 --> 2:40:03.440]  and he literally poured it all out he said after two years you'll be so poor
[2:40:03.440 --> 2:40:09.880]  you won't be able to buy my DVD or Alex Jones DVD you won't be able to get this
[2:40:09.880 --> 2:40:14.920]  material out they had it planned and and whenever I go into some of the things
[2:40:14.920 --> 2:40:19.120]  that is he's how they're going to bring this about okay I'll give you another
[2:40:19.120 --> 2:40:23.360]  one and I'm going to go back and elaborate on these more inflation will
[2:40:23.360 --> 2:40:28.920]  escalate over a period of two years you'll remember back two years ago this
[2:40:28.920 --> 2:40:33.000]  gentleman said to me we're going to have inflation and I kept predicting it was
[2:40:33.000 --> 2:40:37.920]  going to take place in a year to a year and a half and I'm saying now they have
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:42.240]  altered their timeline to the point that inflation will take place and
[2:40:42.240 --> 2:40:47.320]  escalate over a period of two years and by the end of that two years the dollar
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:52.840]  will have so collapsed and inflation will be so high that there's no way in
[2:40:52.840 --> 2:40:57.160]  this world you even be able to afford that airline ticket to go to some Boston
[2:40:57.160 --> 2:41:01.440]  Tea Party somewhere they have it planned within two they feel like they
[2:41:01.440 --> 2:41:05.560]  haven't made I mean they literally think that they have everything in the bag
[2:41:05.560 --> 2:41:12.160]  they've got it right where they wanted you first oh my goodness you first stupid
[2:41:12.160 --> 2:41:16.720]  dumb Americans I mean they think they're laughing at you I mean this
[2:41:16.720 --> 2:41:20.560]  gentleman let me stop me don't laugh against the Americans let me stop you
[2:41:20.560 --> 2:41:23.880]  earlier I read club of rum documents where they said we're going to destroy
[2:41:23.880 --> 2:41:29.240]  the economy by design Maury strong at the UN in 92 said through carbon tax we
[2:41:29.240 --> 2:41:33.520]  will destroy the industrial economy they admit this and now Swartz and Eggers
[2:41:33.520 --> 2:41:39.840]  announcing is going to ban 40 inch TVs they're announcing animal ID premises ID
[2:41:39.840 --> 2:41:43.440]  they're announcing they're going to shut down small markets and bazaars and
[2:41:43.440 --> 2:41:48.040]  garage sales they're announcing trips to be deployed on the streets they're
[2:41:48.040 --> 2:41:51.880]  openly admitting they want to destroy our industry but you're talking to this
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:56.440]  high-level elitist who's given you other good intel in the past and he was
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:42:00.800]  going further specifically that they are doing this to destroy the economy
[2:42:00.800 --> 2:42:04.640]  they've stolen tens of trillions of our own money they're hoarding the money
[2:42:04.640 --> 2:42:07.320]  they're not loaning it that's even mainstream news
[2:42:07.320 --> 2:42:11.080]  governments taking over society go through the bullet points and then go
[2:42:11.080 --> 2:42:14.720]  back over them so he's saying in the next two years they're bringing us into a
[2:42:14.720 --> 2:42:20.240]  full-bored depression they already have a timeline set they have a date set Alex
[2:42:20.240 --> 2:42:24.280]  I mean I was so appalled he never did this before did he say okay well he's
[2:42:24.280 --> 2:42:27.520]  filling his guts did he say they gonna do it the stock market crash or is it
[2:42:27.520 --> 2:42:32.720]  going to be incremental give us the other we're taking notes yeah he he went
[2:42:32.720 --> 2:42:39.360]  on to say all of this it okay here's the next one inflation will escalate over
[2:42:39.360 --> 2:42:43.520]  a period of two years and they're going to do this by design plan I actually have
[2:42:43.520 --> 2:42:49.120]  a schedule of events in chronological order Alex if this you just take a
[2:42:49.120 --> 2:42:53.760]  whole show within itself we'll go over to all events in chronological order over
[2:42:53.760 --> 2:42:58.120]  the next two years of what they're going to do and if you know what the schedule
[2:42:58.120 --> 2:43:04.320]  of events is you will be able to follow it and design your own family's dinner
[2:43:04.320 --> 2:43:09.560]  table and your job okay let me go back to the main lines here inflation will
[2:43:09.560 --> 2:43:14.400]  escalate over a period of two years crude oil prices will remain somewhere
[2:43:14.400 --> 2:43:18.400]  around this they may spike up then they spike down a little bit and then Alex I
[2:43:18.400 --> 2:43:22.400]  asked him about gold and silver and this is something I did not ask him about
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:27.080]  two years ago and you asked me on your show I think it was last time I was on
[2:43:27.080 --> 2:43:30.960]  about gold and silver numbers of other talk shows to pass me the same thing I
[2:43:30.960 --> 2:43:36.040]  couldn't answer it so I asked him the question I said what about gold and
[2:43:36.040 --> 2:43:40.320]  silver are you ready I mean this is going to be startling also and it'll
[2:43:40.320 --> 2:43:44.200]  definitely help you know exactly what to do okay I don't know what you're gonna
[2:43:44.200 --> 2:43:51.480]  say tell me Lindsay he said gold and silver are all you can rely on he said
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:55.840]  this is all money this is what they use have you ever thought about the fact
[2:43:55.840 --> 2:43:59.100]  that when you go in that advice you don't pay any state sales tax there's no
[2:43:59.100 --> 2:44:02.920]  regulations there's no records kept you can buy and sell amongst yourselves
[2:44:02.920 --> 2:44:07.800]  gold and silver is their currency they don't depend on paper they laugh at
[2:44:07.800 --> 2:44:11.040]  these Federal Reserve notes and this paper that's going up and down like a
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:15.960]  yo-yo he said gold and silver all you can depend on all you I'll put it in
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:20.880]  his exact words he said gold and silver all you can rely on now folks you take
[2:44:20.880 --> 2:44:24.600]  the statement go with it anyway you want to you gold deal is do with it what you
[2:44:24.600 --> 2:44:28.840]  want to but I'm just telling you what he said you cannot depend on the Federal
[2:44:28.840 --> 2:44:36.800]  Reserve note is on his way out by 2012 the dollar will be dead folks please I
[2:44:36.800 --> 2:44:41.720]  beg of you listen to what Alex Jones is saying he's telling you things that I
[2:44:41.720 --> 2:44:46.040]  know you think you feel a difficult to believe I'm telling you exactly what
[2:44:46.040 --> 2:44:52.280]  one of the leaders themselves said in the newspaper they're openly saying in
[2:44:52.280 --> 2:44:55.160]  the newspaper they're gonna kill the dollar now please continue Lindsay
[2:44:55.160 --> 2:45:00.160]  on this one Alex and I this one would take a whole program within itself to

[2:45:07.880 --> 2:45:15.320]  two years now I'm sorry that this took me to no end and I asked him to
[2:45:15.320 --> 2:45:19.320]  elaborate and even said where it's going to take place and you said where it'll
[2:45:19.320 --> 2:45:25.040]  start how to spread it's already planned I mean well Lindsay we're gonna tell
[2:45:25.040 --> 2:45:27.920]  people about the DVD where you lay this out over three hours we're gonna have you

[2:45:37.640 --> 2:45:41.400]  where your mouth is with the oil prediction from him you were right
[2:45:41.400 --> 2:45:46.760]  where is he saying the intel I've got from the rand corporation and and the
[2:45:46.760 --> 2:45:51.680]  Pentagon is they're gonna start wars in Eastern Europe wars in Central Asia and
[2:45:51.680 --> 2:45:57.200]  wars in the Middle East simultaneously on the order of World War two
[2:45:57.200 --> 2:46:03.400]  is that a start in Iran it'll start around that Middle East area and it will
[2:46:03.400 --> 2:46:08.040]  more than likely be in relationship to Iran and Israel and it will spread to the
[2:46:08.040 --> 2:46:12.440]  entire world I'll elaborate more and more on that later but he says they're
[2:46:12.440 --> 2:46:19.280]  waiting for two years he said you've got a two-year timeline okay folks please
[2:46:19.280 --> 2:46:27.120]  please listen to me you positively must take action immediately all your
[2:46:27.120 --> 2:46:32.840]  children and your grandchildren will forever be slaves to the elite I've
[2:46:32.840 --> 2:46:37.680]  never heard you with this much earnest in your voice and that's how I am it's
[2:46:37.680 --> 2:46:42.740]  coming down I've never seen a move this quick I can't even believe the lightning
[2:46:42.740 --> 2:46:48.480]  speed they're implementing everything the elite are laughing at us Alex I am
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:53.440]  so stunned you know why they okay they've got so much you already know where
[2:46:53.440 --> 2:46:59.440]  to go you know why the elite altered their timeline you know why but I want
[2:46:59.440 --> 2:47:03.600]  to give it to you as they said the elite have altered their timeline because you
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:06.840]  gave them two and one half trillion dollars in the last two months of the
[2:47:06.840 --> 2:47:12.120]  Bush administration folks you've got to hear this in depth I mean this this would
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:16.320]  take the longest to go into why I'll tell you briefly just before Bush left
[2:47:16.320 --> 2:47:21.320]  office they had created an artificial crisis it really didn't exist in an
[2:47:21.320 --> 2:47:26.000]  amazing that crisis isn't out there anymore right now they came out in
[2:47:26.000 --> 2:47:30.720]  bad mouth the the the the market and said we'd have a depression and it went
[2:47:30.720 --> 2:47:34.280]  down a couple thousand points they admit they the Congress admits they were
[2:47:34.280 --> 2:47:38.560]  terrorized into it yeah they were terrorized into it and the stock market
[2:47:38.560 --> 2:47:43.040]  is going to keep going up and up and up and up walk my words he told me what's
[2:47:43.040 --> 2:47:46.360]  going to happen to the stock market he told me where the price of gold is
[2:47:46.360 --> 2:47:52.760]  going he gave a schedule of events chronologically in order over the next
[2:47:52.760 --> 2:47:58.280]  two years I think he was really doing it Alex because he is so concerned I mean
[2:47:58.280 --> 2:48:02.640]  his conscience must be didn't tell him what this man feels like knowing his
[2:48:02.640 --> 2:48:07.600]  age and where he is and I think really he was trying his best to do everything
[2:48:07.600 --> 2:48:13.360]  he could to one people folks you have got to take action immediately or your
[2:48:13.360 --> 2:48:17.840]  children and grandchildren will ever forever okay let me go back to why they
[2:48:17.840 --> 2:48:21.960]  altered that timeline in the last two months of the Bush administration they
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:25.840]  created an artificial crisis you know that's what the elite is so good at they
[2:48:25.840 --> 2:48:29.920]  created crisis then they created a solution so the solution was for the
[2:48:29.920 --> 2:48:34.480]  American taxpayer to give to the Federal Reserve all of these trillions of
[2:48:34.480 --> 2:48:42.320]  dollars and then I'm sure you remember what happened after it was all over with
[2:48:42.320 --> 2:48:47.080]  and some of the news services came out and said we have got to know where that
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:53.480]  money went to and they they I've got the clip on my DVD they said when the when
[2:48:53.480 --> 2:48:57.120]  the representative of Federal Reserve was asked to appear before Congress and
[2:48:57.120 --> 2:49:02.320]  they demanded to know with two and one-half trillion of this money went
[2:49:02.320 --> 2:49:08.840]  they said we can't tell you we won't let you know we refuse to answer and as a
[2:49:08.840 --> 2:49:15.120]  result of you the taxpayer stupid dumb gullible you they've given you

[2:54:27.640 --> 2:54:32.560]  whistleblower when he worked with Lannick Richfield and a bunch of other big
[2:54:32.560 --> 2:54:38.560]  oil companies up on the Alaskan shelf there on the slope he blew the whistle
[2:54:38.560 --> 2:54:42.720]  about that turned out he was absolutely accurate decades later when it was
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:47.360]  released by Congress same thing with Gulf of Mexico full of oil they won't let
[2:54:47.360 --> 2:54:50.600]  us get to him in any area if the Chinese and others allowed to have it then he
[2:54:50.600 --> 2:54:54.680]  talked to this insider this former CEO of an oil company one of the biggest the
[2:54:54.680 --> 2:54:58.680]  fellow thought he was going to die and I guess that near-death experience has
[2:54:58.680 --> 2:55:03.240]  made him totally spill his guts to Lindsey but now so much of what Lindsey
[2:55:03.240 --> 2:55:06.960]  saying from this insider is clear even from mainstream news Lindsey was
[2:55:06.960 --> 2:55:10.280]  speaking about fall the Republic because you know he's retired been out of the
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:13.960]  country some with family he came back he just now heard I have fall the
[2:55:13.960 --> 2:55:18.600]  Republic and he's saying we haven't talked since my producer just called and
[2:55:18.600 --> 2:55:24.760]  got him on because Lindsey was ready to come on and an email this that these
[2:55:24.760 --> 2:55:29.800]  things mesh together everything Lindsey saying fits in to what we're seeing here
[2:55:29.800 --> 2:55:35.000]  on the ground being set up and being done Lindsey Williams go ahead everyone
[2:55:35.000 --> 2:55:41.680]  listening to the Alex you're right now I must clarify this Alex and I have not
[2:55:41.680 --> 2:55:47.600]  talked one single time all for the program privately we have not compared
[2:55:47.600 --> 2:55:52.000]  notes he did not know what I was gonna say today he does he did not know what
[2:55:52.000 --> 2:55:58.320]  the elite told me I likewise did not go about his new DVD both we have not
[2:55:58.320 --> 2:56:02.160]  compared notes and planned this program I know it sounds like it and some of you
[2:56:02.160 --> 2:56:05.240]  sitting out there gonna say well I'm quite sure these two guys got together
[2:56:05.240 --> 2:56:11.000]  and plan to say all this no we did not did we Alex no I mean you've been told
[2:56:11.000 --> 2:56:17.320]  by your high level retired CEO highest levels this information I've made a
[2:56:17.320 --> 2:56:22.960]  film reverse engineering I mean I've got the Copenhagen Denmark UN climate
[2:56:22.960 --> 2:56:26.680]  change treaty that says world government and I mean I've got it right here and
[2:56:26.680 --> 2:56:31.000]  that they say in their literature they want to destroy our economy I had a
[2:56:31.000 --> 2:56:35.600]  economist from Argentina on a few months ago and he talked about how the
[2:56:35.600 --> 2:56:40.000]  IMF and World Bank come in and we have their documents as well and bankrupt
[2:56:40.000 --> 2:56:44.120]  these countries by design so that you're so poor and starving you can't resist
[2:56:44.120 --> 2:56:49.320]  they're not deploying Northcom for no reason they're not got face scanning and
[2:56:49.320 --> 2:56:54.340]  license plate reading cameras going up for nothing but but but do this run
[2:56:54.340 --> 2:56:57.880]  through your points then let's go back through them but just keep keep dropping
[2:56:57.880 --> 2:57:04.320]  those points on us Lindsay two years two years he kept using it over and over
[2:57:04.320 --> 2:57:09.920]  and over again two years within two years you will not recognize America they
[2:57:09.920 --> 2:57:16.840]  have a timeline the elitist have altered their timeline because you and me the
[2:57:16.840 --> 2:57:22.480]  global Americans gave them two and one half trillion dollars approximately and
[2:57:22.480 --> 2:57:29.120]  Bloomberg demanded of Congress to get an answer they came before the before the
[2:57:29.120 --> 2:57:32.360]  Congress of the United States of America the Federalist the person
[2:57:32.360 --> 2:57:36.040]  representing the Federal Reserve and said I refuse to tell you what two and a
[2:57:36.040 --> 2:57:39.120]  half trillion dollars what they tell you what the other money went but two and
[2:57:39.120 --> 2:57:43.200]  one half trillion you gave to the elite and they still have not told you where
[2:57:43.200 --> 2:57:47.360]  it's going so as a result they altered that timeline you've got to hear all the
[2:57:47.360 --> 2:57:51.000]  details of that they're accelerating it correct they're accelerating the timeline
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:56.080]  they're excellent well I don't know because you see two years ago he told
[2:57:56.080 --> 2:57:59.840]  me he said you're gonna have massive inflation within a year to a year and a
[2:57:59.840 --> 2:58:05.000]  half well if they didn't they didn't do that because when they were able to
[2:58:05.000 --> 2:58:09.080]  alter their timeline and they've done some amazing things in these d8 meetings
[2:58:09.080 --> 2:58:13.560]  it and so on what were you to have attended watch from the outside and here
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:17.120]  this man's telling me what they did on the inside no I know but I mean it was
[2:58:17.120 --> 2:58:21.040]  gonna be a gradual inflation and that's there now they're admitting it's it to
[2:58:21.040 --> 2:58:24.720]  me it's even though it looks like it's not an acceleration it is an acceleration
[2:58:24.720 --> 2:58:29.240]  because it appears they're moving in with their entire program in the next two
[2:58:29.240 --> 2:58:33.720]  years instead of just one plank of it more quickly and but but Lindsay one

[3:08:04.080 --> 3:08:27.840]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:27.840 --> 3:08:33.440]  by the way we have David Ray Griffin on tomorrow debunking the 911 debunkers
[3:08:33.440 --> 3:08:39.200]  going over all the huge new developments on 911 but from 1130 to 1 in the first
[3:08:39.200 --> 3:08:42.440]  two hours tomorrow we're gonna have part two of this it's clear this
[3:08:42.440 --> 3:08:47.360]  information is too powerful I believe that this high-level globalist and I
[3:08:47.360 --> 3:08:53.920]  happen to know who it is you know when he didn't break his promise I've been
[3:08:53.920 --> 3:08:58.720]  interviewing him so long I know the three CEOs were that he mentioned my name
[3:08:58.720 --> 3:09:04.320]  earlier from the oil companies he worked at and for and so then I've
[3:09:04.320 --> 3:09:09.640]  narrowed it down but the point is is that this is fitting in with all the other
[3:09:09.640 --> 3:09:13.600]  Bilderberg info we have I believe Lindsey when he called and said he had
[3:09:13.600 --> 3:09:18.400]  inside knowledge two years ago almost a year almost two years ago more than a
[3:09:18.400 --> 3:09:23.200]  year and a half ago that would go up to the oil will go down to $50 a barrel and
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:27.880]  stay there for a year and it did that incredible prediction no one saw that
[3:09:27.880 --> 3:09:31.120]  coming but then I noticed in our own Bilderberg coverage it was a footnote
[3:09:31.120 --> 3:09:35.880]  from Jim Tucker and a footnote from Daniel Estolin that inside sources said
[3:09:35.880 --> 3:09:45.800]  Bilderberg was gonna cut oil in half from 150 to below 70 that happened so again
[3:09:45.800 --> 3:09:49.120]  people ask how do I know it's credible how do I know it's not well number one
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:53.520]  has somebody been accurate over and over again yes number two does it fit in with
[3:09:53.520 --> 3:09:57.600]  all the other intel I have yes now could they alter something maybe down the road
[3:09:57.600 --> 3:10:03.520]  if we get involved if we speak up if we say no but America is has
[3:10:03.520 --> 3:10:13.320]  capitulated the United States has given in to tyranny and once they know you've
[3:10:13.320 --> 3:10:17.080]  capitulated and will put up with anything then that's when the real tyranny
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:20.320]  starts all the tyranny corruption we've seen is only the beginning I was just
[3:10:20.320 --> 3:10:25.480]  showing a video police in Milwaukee a guy on a bike the police say stop try to
[3:10:25.480 --> 3:10:31.840]  taser him the guy gets scared the police run him over in the car killing him
[3:10:31.840 --> 3:10:37.000]  admitting they wanted to kill him and then the police are heroes on the news
[3:10:37.000 --> 3:10:42.720]  that's pure evil just like they rubber bullet people to death and they killed a
[3:10:42.720 --> 3:10:51.800]  guy in Seattle last year the guy just comes outside from a store they need
[3:10:51.800 --> 3:10:55.920]  another suspect they they come over he gets scared by the cop kind of turns the
[3:10:55.920 --> 3:10:59.920]  cop knocks him up hits the ground kills him the cops are on the TV saying we
[3:10:59.920 --> 3:11:03.640]  don't care we didn't do anything wrong they've dehumanized us and the police
[3:11:03.640 --> 3:11:10.880]  themselves are dehumanized but I mean they just murder this guy and don't care
[3:11:10.880 --> 3:11:15.040]  stormtroopers of death ladies and gentlemen and I know the average cop is
[3:11:15.040 --> 3:11:22.120]  an evil person in and of themselves but the mantle the system the training anyway
[3:11:22.120 --> 3:11:26.440]  side issue it's just God help us all we are an evil nation we are now being
[3:11:26.440 --> 3:11:30.040]  brought to judgment now Lindsay Williams you've always been credible and I
[3:11:30.040 --> 3:11:34.320]  believe that this high-level retired executive who's almost died recently did
[3:11:34.320 --> 3:11:38.080]  spill his guts to you Charlotte Isherby was the number two at Department of
[3:11:38.080 --> 3:11:43.480]  Education she said they were planning year-round schooling a decade ago on
[3:11:43.480 --> 3:11:47.840]  this show everything she said is now coming true she wrote a book the size
[3:11:47.840 --> 3:11:51.400]  of a Dallas phone book that we sell by the way deliberate dumbing down of
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:56.320]  America and it's mainly just documents so I know this is their plan just like I
[3:11:56.320 --> 3:12:02.720]  read they plan to ban most air travel it's now mainstream news today I knew
[3:12:02.720 --> 3:12:06.320]  they had face scanning and license plate reading stuff 12 years ago now it's
[3:12:06.320 --> 3:12:13.600]  mainstream news so so Charlotte Isherby's father he was sculling bones and bohemian
[3:12:13.600 --> 3:12:16.920]  Grove and always kind of laughed at her in her anti-novel order stance she was
[3:12:16.920 --> 3:12:21.240]  taken care of him while he was dying of cancer and he would hear her doing
[3:12:21.240 --> 3:12:26.240]  radio interviews and about a month before he died he accepted Jesus people
[3:12:26.240 --> 3:12:29.480]  don't like to hear this but this is what got him to come out of his his his
[3:12:29.480 --> 3:12:38.480]  situation and he cried and said yes basically it's Satanism and repented
[3:12:38.480 --> 3:12:42.440]  and said I wish I was well to go back and tell the other guys that they
[3:12:42.440 --> 3:12:47.480]  shouldn't be part of this and I want to tell the police that you've got time to
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:52.280]  turn back but you are the army of Satan now I mean that I mean you even if you
[3:12:52.280 --> 3:12:56.000]  don't believe in God this is satanic this is evil what else do you call it now
[3:12:56.000 --> 3:12:59.080]  Lindsay I'm gonna shut up because I got a few other things I got to cover to I
[3:12:59.080 --> 3:13:03.320]  said it and dispersed some news I've got but you're back tomorrow thank God for
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:09.600]  that but but but just just do this go over the bullet points quickly then they
[3:13:09.600 --> 3:13:13.960]  got page after page a prelude for tomorrow but then go back to this guy
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:19.520]  saying how they've taken over the churches and the devils what was the
[3:13:19.520 --> 3:13:26.200]  term he used the devil's devil's Messiah the devil's Messiah so so and at the
[3:13:26.200 --> 3:13:30.120]  elite level they're all in the Luciferianism there's no doubt I mean
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:35.640]  that's been in their own documents this is so insane but it's real continue
[3:13:35.640 --> 3:13:41.120]  Alex and everybody out in the listening order there positively I just I must
[3:13:41.120 --> 3:13:45.520]  emphasize this there positively is a group of people on the face of the earth
[3:13:45.520 --> 3:13:49.720]  who control the world that you've had Alex say this over and over and over I'm
[3:13:49.720 --> 3:13:54.680]  punctuating it again right now there is a group of people on the face of the
[3:13:54.680 --> 3:13:59.240]  earth who control the world they offer real they know what they're doing they
[3:13:59.240 --> 3:14:03.120]  are able to accomplish what they want they control Congress they control the
[3:14:03.120 --> 3:14:06.560]  president and by the way they're having trouble with this president whenever I
[3:14:06.560 --> 3:14:11.680]  get I think I'll probably save that for tomorrow they did want McCain as
[3:14:11.680 --> 3:14:15.600]  president and you know I said that last year and then somebody afterwards said
[3:14:15.600 --> 3:14:19.520]  now they didn't get McCain in they really fluffed up didn't they well they did
[3:14:19.520 --> 3:14:24.560]  and they did you know they're not divine they think they are but they aren't and
[3:14:24.560 --> 3:14:28.560]  when they didn't get McCain in they're having trouble and this gentleman went
[3:14:28.560 --> 3:14:32.720]  on to tell me the trouble they're having with mr. Obama and they have some
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:37.200]  choice words oh my gracious I'd shake in my shoes if I was mr. Obama right now
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:42.240]  because the elite don't like his arrogance pride and some of the other
[3:14:42.240 --> 3:14:47.520]  things he's doing okay let's get back to this they do exist this man told me what
[3:14:47.520 --> 3:14:52.840]  they're doing you're right about the other gentleman who on his deathbed said
[3:14:52.840 --> 3:14:56.880]  don't follow these people they're positively Satanist one of the first
[3:14:56.880 --> 3:15:01.120]  things I learned when I lived with the elite years ago was to listen to their
[3:15:01.120 --> 3:15:08.960]  buzzwords I'd like to read you a few buzzwords that this man used and I want
[3:15:08.960 --> 3:15:13.880]  you to quickly in your mind think what is the very first thing you think about
[3:15:13.880 --> 3:15:18.480]  whenever I give you these buzzwords now these are his exact statements and
[3:15:18.480 --> 3:15:23.320]  whenever I read you his buzzwords I know how to to understand them because I
[3:15:23.320 --> 3:15:28.360]  learned years ago to read between the lines listen to that buzzwords and then
[3:15:28.360 --> 3:15:32.040]  know what they're talking about okay I'm going to read you his buzzwords word
[3:15:32.040 --> 3:15:35.960]  for word and then the first thing that pops in your mind that you think these
[3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:41.200]  buzzwords mean here goes number one war brought the country out of the
[3:15:41.200 --> 3:15:49.200]  depression the second buzzword turmoil in the Middle East two years from now the
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:56.840]  next buzzword Iran's eternal external enemy Israel I want these down as he
[3:15:56.840 --> 3:16:03.320]  was saying them another buzzword crude oil will say 70 to 50 dollars until the
[3:16:03.320 --> 3:16:09.400]  next crisis in the Middle East the next buzzword nearly everyone will be
[3:16:09.400 --> 3:16:13.160]  working for the gun of course the first thing that pops into your mind when you
[3:16:13.160 --> 3:16:23.160]  hear something like that communism yeah we control and war war listen to war
[3:16:23.160 --> 3:16:26.120]  brought the country out of the first return model in the Middle East Iran's
[3:16:26.120 --> 3:16:31.960]  eternal external enemy Israel crude oil say there until the Middle East crisis
[3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:36.760]  and they already have it planned you remember back two years ago Alex and I
[3:16:36.760 --> 3:16:44.760]  said this on your show he said we don't want war with Iran and here all of our
[3:16:44.760 --> 3:16:50.000]  battleships were lined up over there in the Persian Gulf hour they were on ready
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:56.440]  alert everything was right ready the Air Force man we had nearly everything in
[3:16:56.440 --> 3:16:59.520]  the way of all of it right over there in the Middle East ready for something to
[3:16:59.520 --> 3:17:03.600]  take place in the straight of our moves and then this man told how much I was
[3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:07.120]  predicting it as was most of the talk show hosts that we were going to have
[3:17:07.120 --> 3:17:11.400]  war with Iran in the very near he had near term and that was a year and a half
[3:17:11.400 --> 3:17:16.360]  ago and this man said to me we do not want war with Iran I came on radio talk
[3:17:16.360 --> 3:17:20.160]  shows and some of the talk show hosts got upset at me because they were saying
[3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:24.040]  we're going to have war with Iran and I said this man said we don't want war
[3:17:24.040 --> 3:17:28.880]  with Iran right now now he turned around and he says we've extended our time
[3:17:28.880 --> 3:17:35.120]  line and he says here's the new timeline and he says Iran is in the picture but
[3:17:35.120 --> 3:17:39.760]  it's in the picture for approximately two years from now so I'm warning you what
[3:17:39.760 --> 3:17:43.280]  we thought was going to take place a year and a half to two years ago you've
[3:17:43.280 --> 3:17:46.880]  got it down the line two years from now and it's going to break out and spread
[3:17:46.880 --> 3:17:51.880]  all over the world at the time it happens and he used buzzwords that
[3:17:51.880 --> 3:17:55.960]  indicated to me that they have something definitely in the wind for that period
[3:17:55.960 --> 3:18:01.800]  of time I'm just telling you what this gentleman says believe me for 35 years
[3:18:01.800 --> 3:18:07.560]  all I have ever done is voiced what the elite have told me I'm just a little
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:13.440]  everyday sort of a guy believe me I am not a prophet but everything that these
[3:18:13.440 --> 3:18:18.280]  people have said for the past 35 years has taken place and you can believe it
[3:18:18.280 --> 3:18:22.800]  this is going to take place also Lindsay let's go back to this let's go back to
[3:18:22.800 --> 3:18:26.560]  this taking over the preachers and the devil's Messiah what was he saying that
[3:18:26.560 --> 3:18:32.360]  was well we came around to how they how that all of this is coming about
[3:18:32.360 --> 3:18:36.400]  whenever he said that within two years you'll be so broke you won't be able to
[3:18:36.400 --> 3:18:41.280]  rebel against America against the elite excuse me America will not be able to
[3:18:41.280 --> 3:18:46.600]  rebel against the elite and down to the fact that they have two years and the
[3:18:46.600 --> 3:18:51.320]  dollar basically will will be a thing of the past and inflation it well we went
[3:18:51.320 --> 3:18:55.520]  through all of these two years things and naturally being a pastor I went back
[3:18:55.520 --> 3:19:00.320]  at that point and said to him I said and I called him my name I said do you
[3:19:00.320 --> 3:19:04.560]  remember at Fruto Bay when Speedy Jones came to know Christ as the Savior and
[3:19:04.560 --> 3:19:08.040]  how it literally turned Fruto Bay upside down I thought I'd get him on this
[3:19:08.040 --> 3:19:12.480]  subject and I really wasn't asking him for things in the religious world but he

[3:19:31.840 --> 3:19:37.120]  and he used the expression the devil's Messiah and I asked him to kind of
[3:19:37.120 --> 3:19:40.800]  elaborate a little bit about what he was talking about and he went into the

[3:24:32.920 --> 3:24:38.240]  segment long segment coming up but but I want so you said you were just
[3:24:38.240 --> 3:24:43.280]  mentioning hey remember us on the North slope remember when one of the you know
[3:24:43.280 --> 3:24:47.120]  one of the heads of the big work groups became a Christian and everybody else
[3:24:47.120 --> 3:24:55.560]  was getting saved he then launches in to the devil's Messiah to tell us what
[3:24:55.560 --> 3:25:00.840]  that means what Alex Jones says in his new DVD and I haven't seen it yet
[3:25:00.840 --> 3:25:06.800]  Alex I'm sure looking forward to it I guarantee you that what this man told me
[3:25:06.800 --> 3:25:12.320]  is going to back up every single thing that Alex Jones says in his new DVD he
[3:25:12.320 --> 3:25:15.360]  went into the subject as Alex just suggested he wants to keep me on the
[3:25:15.360 --> 3:25:21.880]  subject of the devil's Messiah have you been asked by your church and your
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:27.800]  pastor lately to fill out a form in which it asked very personal questions
[3:25:27.800 --> 3:25:31.480]  and they say that they'd like it for the purpose of being able to know more
[3:25:31.480 --> 3:25:37.480]  about the people in the church yes it's happening everywhere you better be careful
[3:25:37.480 --> 3:25:44.200]  folks did you realize that this is all that at homeland security has all my
[3:25:44.200 --> 3:25:47.200]  goodness I wish I had time to go and homeland security but I can't know you
[3:25:47.200 --> 3:25:52.400]  do go over it go just tell us that that homeland security has actually requested
[3:25:52.400 --> 3:25:57.880]  of the pastors to get this information and to make it available to them at any
[3:25:57.880 --> 3:26:02.520]  such time that they might want it and they asked personal questions your
[3:26:02.520 --> 3:26:05.920]  salary the number of people in your house the number of computers you have
[3:26:05.920 --> 3:26:10.680]  on and on and on I attended the church we just came back as I mentioned to you
[3:26:10.680 --> 3:26:14.160]  three months I disappeared literally disappeared haven't done a single radio
[3:26:14.160 --> 3:26:18.760]  talk show up until today Alex I guess that's the reason I'm so excited because
[3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:22.560]  I have a privilege of giving out what this man just told me your show being
[3:26:22.560 --> 3:26:27.400]  the very first one and I was in a church in the course of our travels and this
[3:26:27.400 --> 3:26:32.200]  church asked the people to fill out this brochure and I looked at it and almost
[3:26:32.200 --> 3:26:36.880]  gagged I couldn't believe what I was seeing it's exactly what homeland
[3:26:36.880 --> 3:26:41.760]  security has requested of the pastors to be able to pay it's worse than that
[3:26:41.760 --> 3:26:45.440]  Lindsey we're the ones that broke three years ago on Genesis Pastor butch
[3:26:45.440 --> 3:26:50.640]  bought it first the the clergy response team secret documents tell your flocks
[3:26:50.640 --> 3:26:54.920]  Roman 13 tell them give their guns up tell them take force inoculations tell
[3:26:54.920 --> 3:26:59.520]  them world governments good tell them to worship whoever the president is then it
[3:26:59.520 --> 3:27:02.960]  came out mainstream news that our documents were real people couldn't
[3:27:02.960 --> 3:27:06.840]  believe it just Google clergy response teams you can watch newscast everything
[3:27:06.840 --> 3:27:11.040]  saying yeah we're getting ready to go to the camps actually say the camps and how
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:15.600]  it's of the Lord to go to the camps very very like communist China or Russia
[3:27:15.600 --> 3:27:20.520]  using the churches and then one of my friends brought me from dripping
[3:27:20.520 --> 3:27:25.760]  springs big Baptist church they got ordered you don't talk about politics
[3:27:25.760 --> 3:27:30.480]  at with anybody at the church even when you're eating dinner with them you shut
[3:27:30.480 --> 3:27:34.120]  up and do what the government says these are prison grids you talk about
[3:27:34.120 --> 3:27:40.680]  devilish go ahead please folks I beg of you if you even attend any kind of church
[3:27:40.680 --> 3:27:46.200]  at all I don't care what it is please get my DVD to the pastors of your church
[3:27:46.200 --> 3:27:51.800]  I beg of you now we have put this in a beautiful folder this is not like I used
[3:27:51.800 --> 3:27:56.640]  to do dorky I know in the past we've had very dorky DVDs then not this time I
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:00.600]  said the whole country has this has got to be so attractive that everybody will
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:05.520]  want it we put all six of them into one beautiful folder with a multi-cover cover
[3:28:05.520 --> 3:28:09.600]  on the back and the front you've never seen anything so nice anybody would
[3:28:09.600 --> 3:28:14.560]  want it give it to you pastor I beg of you he will actually look at this one
[3:28:14.560 --> 3:28:18.800]  and wanted we're gonna fire the number out but here's my question I know
[3:28:18.800 --> 3:28:22.800]  insiders leak info is he telling you this because he thinks there's nothing
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:27.640]  anybody can do or is it because of his conscience believing he's gonna die
[3:28:27.640 --> 3:28:33.560]  soon little bit of both I think he did it mainly because of his conscience and I
[3:28:33.560 --> 3:28:39.920]  think he did it as he said he said you you Americans he said you have fallen
[3:28:39.920 --> 3:28:44.960]  for every line for every carrot we put in front of you you've swallowed hook
[3:28:44.960 --> 3:28:49.920]  line in secret everything we have said and they are laughing and he's telling
[3:28:49.920 --> 3:28:54.080]  you this because you were his pastor with the oil company and he knows if you
[3:28:54.080 --> 3:28:59.480]  say you won't speak with the pastor parishioner you know like the attorney
[3:28:59.480 --> 3:29:04.680]  client privilege that he knows he can put this out you'll reach millions of
[3:29:04.680 --> 3:29:07.800]  people because you've already had the best-selling book 20 years ago about
[3:29:07.800 --> 3:29:12.600]  the oil in Alaska I mean is that why he gave you this information understand
[3:29:12.600 --> 3:29:16.080]  of course that they do not have chaplain's old pipeline they've never
[3:29:16.080 --> 3:29:18.880]  known him any place in the world the only time this has happened to my
[3:29:18.880 --> 3:29:23.720]  knowledge is on the times Alaska oil pipeline I probably and one of the only
[3:29:23.720 --> 3:29:30.680]  people of his kind this has ever personally man-to-man eyeball to eyeball
[3:29:30.680 --> 3:29:35.880]  face-to-face day after day been in the presence of this man and it gained a
[3:29:35.880 --> 3:29:41.800]  sense of confidence that probably understand your life as counselor stay
[3:29:41.800 --> 3:29:45.440]  there Lindsay I want to come back and get into the Homeland Security get into
[3:29:45.440 --> 3:29:49.680]  more of this religious stuff because I want to hear his view on that when you

[3:30:03.480 --> 3:30:07.920]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[3:30:07.920 --> 3:30:11.920]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[3:30:11.920 --> 3:30:15.840]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[3:30:15.840 --> 3:30:19.840]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[3:30:19.840 --> 3:30:24.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[3:30:24.400 --> 3:30:28.400]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[3:30:28.400 --> 3:30:32.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[3:30:32.200 --> 3:30:35.840]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[3:37:07.040 --> 3:37:13.480]  to Lindsay Williams but I wanted to get Ted on because gold is continuing to move
[3:37:13.480 --> 3:37:19.880]  up it's up at an all-time record high again today it's been up above a thousand
[3:37:19.880 --> 3:37:25.800]  sixty the writing is on the wall they might hammer it back down again below a
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:29.680]  thousand but then next time it'll go up to a thousand one hundred and then down
[3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:33.000]  to a thousand and a thousand two hundred to a thousand one hundred a thousand
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:38.560]  three hundred these are the ceilings mainline experts on Bloomberg and CNBC
[3:37:38.560 --> 3:37:42.200]  are saying two thousand I'm not saying that let me tell you some I bought most
[3:37:42.200 --> 3:37:46.040]  of my gold I don't have much but I got some in a safety deposit box and stuff
[3:37:46.040 --> 3:37:50.320]  like that and I got a lot of silver and that's also people say well that's not
[3:37:50.320 --> 3:37:53.760]  safe either to say deposit box well that's where I keep it you know the
[3:37:53.760 --> 3:38:01.520]  point is that you can go bury it if you want the point here is is that I'm not
[3:38:01.520 --> 3:38:05.080]  selling silver I bought at five dollars an ounce and gold I bought at three
[3:38:05.080 --> 3:38:11.640]  hundred I'm not selling it it's insurance folks but for insurance there's
[3:38:11.640 --> 3:38:18.600]  few things you invest in as insurance and then on top of it also as an
[3:38:18.600 --> 3:38:24.680]  investment as one of the hottest investments paper is a fraud the globalist
[3:38:24.680 --> 3:38:28.240]  are using paper they create to buy the world then they destroy their own paper
[3:38:28.240 --> 3:38:32.200]  with us left holding the bag I'm gonna bring Ted up now I haven't asked Ted
[3:38:32.200 --> 3:38:35.960]  yet today if he's run out of gold he bought at the thousand dollar level and
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:39.240]  silver he bought at the twelve dollar level I know he told me last Friday when
[3:38:39.240 --> 3:38:43.600]  I bought another little bag of silver that he was almost out of that if I
[3:38:43.600 --> 3:38:48.280]  wanted anymore because that's what I keep as my emergency nest egg and for this
[3:38:48.280 --> 3:38:52.240]  company to operate on and more and more we try to keep money in the bank as
[3:38:52.240 --> 3:38:55.480]  operating capital I'm trying to shift it out because who knows if that'll be
[3:38:55.480 --> 3:39:00.440]  there we won't be able to operate here we have huge overhead the issue here is
[3:39:00.440 --> 3:39:04.240]  that's why we're always also having sponsors on I'm not funded by the New
[3:39:04.240 --> 3:39:08.120]  World Order I'm funded by me and my sponsors you buying the DVDs the
[3:39:08.120 --> 3:39:11.200]  sponsors that's why I forget to the end of the show even plug them they all come
[3:39:11.200 --> 3:39:14.920]  at once but please support them Ted just I'm gonna I need to go back to Lindsay
[3:39:14.920 --> 3:39:21.080]  Williams super hop and I appreciate you coming on and waiting Ted what gold and
[3:39:21.080 --> 3:39:25.600]  silver do you have now at that lower price because it keeps going up people
[3:39:25.600 --> 3:39:29.160]  need to take advantage of this yeah gold is up today the dollars dropping again
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:34.480]  today very sad day for the dollar but gold is going up up $7 and some odd
[3:39:34.480 --> 3:39:38.760]  cents today already and the gold that I'm using right now the stuff that I
[3:39:38.760 --> 3:39:42.320]  have that's trading at that thousand dollar levels the British Sovereigns and
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:48.560]  the Franks they're at 293 and 238 I'm not gonna say a whole lot about this
[3:39:48.560 --> 3:39:51.880]  just because I don't have a whole lot left and that that would be the 10
[3:39:51.880 --> 3:39:57.280]  dollar Liberty we have those at 818 50 walking Liberty haves without a question
[3:39:57.280 --> 3:40:03.120]  still Alex I'm still offering those at 869 that is just an incredible
[3:40:03.120 --> 3:40:07.840]  incredible buy with where silver is at right now so I'd recommend that people
[3:40:07.840 --> 3:40:13.680]  get into that take and what is silver right now well silver $17 hang on a
[3:40:13.680 --> 3:40:17.360]  second let me just get the latest price for you real quick because you know it
[3:40:17.360 --> 3:40:24.520]  changes so fast and $17 and 70 cents 1771 right now is what I show so you
[3:40:24.520 --> 3:40:30.160]  know the market is real hot in that area as well it's just been a really strong
[3:40:30.160 --> 3:40:36.160]  strong market just like the just like Lindsay saying the dollars losing value
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:40.240]  it's gonna lose value and it's losing it fast I really don't want to interrupt
[3:40:40.240 --> 3:40:44.040]  Lindsay Williams he's got such great information but I can tell you if you're
[3:40:44.040 --> 3:40:48.160]  looking to buy gold and silver I don't know why you wouldn't be I mean if you
[3:40:48.160 --> 3:40:52.320]  have money in the stocks the bank CDs I mean you can just name it if it's
[3:40:52.320 --> 3:40:56.600]  sitting you know in annuities I mean where are you gonna be I mean all the
[3:40:56.600 --> 3:41:02.920]  stuff is you know price based upon paper currency gold and silver is money and
[3:41:02.920 --> 3:41:08.560]  has been money for thousands and thousands of years and it's it dates
[3:41:08.560 --> 3:41:15.080]  back to pre bank of England times before the banking of England even started to
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:21.680]  print fiat currency you know I mean this is just you know a no-brainer people
[3:41:21.680 --> 3:41:25.320]  should be in golden so absolutely what are the Frank set in the sovereigns I
[3:41:25.320 --> 3:41:29.640]  like the sovereigns currently the Frank right now is at 238 the sovereign right
[3:41:29.640 --> 3:41:34.960]  now is at 293 and so that's still the lower price it is still the lower price
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:40.080]  how long can you hold that when are you running out I again I mean if I start
[3:41:40.080 --> 3:41:45.960]  breaking that 1070 and my supply it's just gonna dry up I'm I'm hoping remember
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:49.280]  you said that you thought maybe gold hit below a thousand dollars an ounce again
[3:41:49.280 --> 3:41:55.080]  I am just you know salivating hoping to get that possibility because when that
[3:41:55.080 --> 3:41:58.440]  does happen I'm gonna be buying hands down well it appears it's found the new
[3:41:58.440 --> 3:42:04.800]  bottom at 1,040 to 1,060 it's just sitting there here's the number folks are
[3:42:04.800 --> 3:42:11.120]  there this is a time machine you go back in time and get gold and silver from a
[3:42:11.120 --> 3:42:17.200]  silver market at $12 and change when it's at 1217 when it's at 17 and change
[3:42:17.200 --> 3:42:24.440]  and gold when it was at the 1000 level when it's at 1,060 I mean this you
[3:42:24.440 --> 3:42:31.600]  cannot beat this type of deal if you're getting into precious metals 800 686 2237
[3:42:31.600 --> 3:42:37.880]  800 686 2237 Ted probably won't be able to hold this deal much longer give them
[3:42:37.880 --> 3:42:44.280]  a call tell them it's the Alec Jones special 800 686 2237 Ted thank you so
[3:42:44.280 --> 3:42:47.560]  much for being on with us well thanks for having me up and of course thank the
[3:42:47.560 --> 3:42:51.560]  listeners for being so supportive of the Genesis Network and Midas I really
[3:42:51.560 --> 3:42:56.760]  appreciate it thank you Ted all right going back to Lindsey Williams his
[3:42:56.760 --> 3:43:01.080]  prediction earlier well the elite told him gold's only gonna be going up that
[3:43:01.080 --> 3:43:06.720]  is what your insider told you correct Lindsey Alex the elite said to me gold
[3:43:06.720 --> 3:43:12.600]  and silver all I'm gonna put it word for word now he said gold and silver all
[3:43:12.600 --> 3:43:20.480]  you can rely on those of his words and he said this is our currency I almost
[3:43:20.480 --> 3:43:24.200]  it that the American people have got the paper and the elite have got the gold
[3:43:24.200 --> 3:43:29.320]  and silver he said this is our currency he said golden silver all you can rely
[3:43:29.320 --> 3:43:34.880]  on two years from now the dollar will be zilch it will be dead is the exact
[3:43:34.880 --> 3:43:39.840]  word or the dollar will be dead is there anyway and by the way just for it
[3:43:39.840 --> 3:43:42.440]  could you keep the only given your number out once we're getting emails and
[3:43:42.440 --> 3:43:46.520]  calls asking for that toll-free number everybody get your pens and paper ready

[3:43:56.480 --> 3:44:01.360]  old are you Lindsey 73 but I'm not going to retire Alex I can't there's too much
[3:44:01.360 --> 3:44:04.360]  you sliding happening out here I'm gonna you're doing a great job will you look
[3:44:04.360 --> 3:44:08.640]  you will you look younger than 73 but the point is I know you got this info so
[3:44:08.640 --> 3:44:11.120]  you've rushed out and you're doing this we're gonna tell people how to how to
[3:44:11.120 --> 3:44:14.000]  get this and get it out to everybody at the end of the show but but but just in
[3:44:14.000 --> 3:44:17.680]  the time we have left before tomorrow we're gonna go into more depth 30 minutes
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:24.400]  in the start of the show 11 30 central 9 30 Pacific 12 30 Eastern 10 30 mountain
[3:44:24.400 --> 3:44:26.480]  if you want to get technical for everybody out there listening when
[3:44:26.480 --> 3:44:30.600]  you're on with us for an hour and a half tomorrow we've got 15 minutes left so
[3:44:30.600 --> 3:44:35.240]  so so finish up with the spiritual issue because you said he never talked a lot
[3:44:35.240 --> 3:44:39.880]  about that with you he went off down into that and then Homeland Security more a
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:44.880]  prelude of what's coming tomorrow and you also mentioned that that that they
[3:44:44.880 --> 3:44:50.200]  plan to destroy Barack Obama obviously they build him up they destroy him or
[3:44:50.200 --> 3:44:55.120]  what your insight and tell us on that well two years ago let's begin with Mr.
[3:44:55.120 --> 3:45:01.040]  Obama then I'll go back into the other part also two years ago he said to me he
[3:45:01.040 --> 3:45:05.440]  said McCain is our man that was a part of the election and I kept making this
[3:45:05.440 --> 3:45:09.760]  statement that McCain was going to be elected well that is what he said and I'm
[3:45:09.760 --> 3:45:13.520]  learning more and more to stick with his exact words because these people are
[3:45:13.520 --> 3:45:17.760]  very precise in the way they word things and that's the reason I've read some of
[3:45:17.760 --> 3:45:21.760]  his words today such as the one about gold and silver he said golden silver all
[3:45:21.760 --> 3:45:27.360]  you can rely on now it didn't say where it was going he didn't say $2,000 an
[3:45:27.360 --> 3:45:31.800]  ounce but you read between the lines and you get it for yourself now they said
[3:45:31.800 --> 3:45:36.320]  two years ago McCain is our man well I said McCain's going to be elected that
[3:45:36.320 --> 3:45:40.760]  isn't what he said when he was not elected I asked him about that this
[3:45:40.760 --> 3:45:48.800]  time and oh my goodness Alex did I get an earful yes they did want McCain in
[3:45:48.800 --> 3:45:54.000]  and they expected to get him but keep in mind these people are not divine they
[3:45:54.000 --> 3:45:57.920]  don't always get what they want Americans you still have time to rise up in
[3:45:57.920 --> 3:46:03.600]  on Lindsay let me stop you though I there's one elite but kind of like at a
[3:46:03.600 --> 3:46:06.500]  mafia commission meeting they're all a Cosa Nostra but they're different
[3:46:06.500 --> 3:46:12.200]  families isn't I mean I know there's a hagelling and dialectic of the Fabian
[3:46:12.200 --> 3:46:18.040]  Socialist and then a more rabid group could you not be talking to one arm of
[3:46:18.040 --> 3:46:24.320]  the New World Order because also a lot of elites wanted Obama well let's kind of
[3:46:24.320 --> 3:46:28.200]  get a pecking order here you start out with probably no more than a dozen
[3:46:28.200 --> 3:46:33.840]  people and at the very top you know who they are George Bush senior daddy Bush
[3:46:33.840 --> 3:46:39.600]  you could not get any more elite of the elite than he and Kissinger well there's
[3:46:39.600 --> 3:46:45.120]  probably no more than a dozen people in that elite of the elite then down from
[3:46:45.120 --> 3:46:49.120]  that you've got a little bit larger group and you come out of skull and bones
[3:46:49.120 --> 3:46:52.960]  and get down to some other group that may not know quite as much as what they
[3:46:52.960 --> 3:46:57.720]  know now the gentleman that I know he's not too far down the line I wouldn't
[3:46:57.720 --> 3:47:02.480]  say that he's up there with where Kissinger and Bush senior he's in the
[3:47:02.480 --> 3:47:09.400]  second tier he probably is if I could guess because he knows what goes on in
[3:47:09.400 --> 3:47:15.240]  in the meetings you know the meetings like you attended and viewed them from
[3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:19.320]  the outside he knows what goes on in those sort of meetings so yeah he's
[3:47:19.320 --> 3:47:24.440]  pretty close down the line now these people expected McCain to get in they
[3:47:24.440 --> 3:47:30.160]  wanted McCain in they find that's McCain's program and now that they got
[3:47:30.160 --> 3:47:37.640]  Obama they've got Obama's got trouble me oh my goodness they made it known to me
[3:47:37.640 --> 3:47:43.560]  that if Obama doesn't straighten out and I'm not going to use the word over
[3:47:43.560 --> 3:47:48.320]  the air I can't I mean they even told me in the studio this past week studio
[3:47:48.320 --> 3:47:52.120]  almost said don't you dare say that here he said take that off the record I'll
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:56.480]  just put it this way if Obama doesn't straighten out and quit this holiday
[3:47:56.480 --> 3:48:00.720]  pride arrogant and not listening to them and doing things the way that he
[3:48:00.720 --> 3:48:06.520]  wants them done he he's he's in big trouble wait a minute you're saying
[3:48:06.520 --> 3:48:13.160]  from your source that that that at least one big strata of the elite will

[3:48:18.720 --> 3:48:27.960]  JFK on Obama you said it I didn't well no I mean I'm just reporting here you're
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:32.040]  saying you have an inside source and that and that he's not saying he's gonna

[3:48:38.360 --> 3:48:44.760]  go ahead well they aren't satisfied with this man this man is is jumping out
[3:48:44.760 --> 3:48:49.960]  doing things without their permission and he is in some real hot water if he
[3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:54.640]  keeps up the way he's going in fact it wouldn't surprise me anything now I in
[3:48:54.640 --> 3:48:59.920]  my DVD I big people I say don't you touch this man none of you bunch of
[3:48:59.920 --> 3:49:03.160]  radicals out there and I know there's a real hotheads listening to the program

[3:49:06.920 --> 3:49:12.920]  himself he's going to I was I'm sorry I used the wrong word there he is going
[3:49:12.920 --> 3:49:17.840]  to defeat himself in the very near future and don't you dare go out there
[3:49:17.840 --> 3:49:21.400]  and touch him because if you do you'll make a hero out of let's see you may
[3:49:21.400 --> 3:49:25.360]  exactly the elite love him from what I've seen and have built him up and
[3:49:25.360 --> 3:49:28.840]  given him Nobel prizes that's the elite of the elite and the only way to make
[3:49:28.840 --> 3:49:35.800]  him a winner is to try something or hurt him that will then elevate him well
[3:49:35.800 --> 3:49:41.720]  they buy him by giving him a Nobel Peace Prize they limit what he's able to do
[3:49:41.720 --> 3:49:47.560]  in certain areas by tying his hands and so they're trying their best to tie him
[3:49:47.560 --> 3:49:51.920]  down so that they can get out of him what they want out of him but this man is
[3:49:51.920 --> 3:49:58.000]  so unpredictable until even these people having trouble with him and it was
[3:49:58.000 --> 3:50:05.760]  indicated to me this guy better be very careful what he's doing I mean it's
[3:50:05.760 --> 3:50:12.080]  it's it's dawdling it's it's dangerous now let me get into the next subject we'll
[3:50:12.080 --> 3:50:15.840]  touch on that maybe a little bit more but you're right everything you just said

[3:50:33.040 --> 3:50:38.640]  president to mr. Obama he used to use expression all the time God bless you
[3:50:38.640 --> 3:50:44.240]  well fine but most pastors fell for that line and thought that he was talking
[3:50:44.240 --> 3:50:49.520]  about their God but no quite to the contrary the true and living God of the
[3:50:49.520 --> 3:50:55.640]  Bible is one God the Bible talks about a second God stay there stay there we may

[4:00:25.840 --> 4:00:32.080]  pastor Lindsay Williams wrote a book 25 plus years ago about all the oil reserves
[4:00:32.080 --> 4:00:37.160]  in Alaska it's confirmed he worked there with these people he was a chaplain to
[4:00:37.160 --> 4:00:40.280]  these big board meetings between three big oil companies he did get to know
[4:00:40.280 --> 4:00:44.920]  these people over a year and a half ago he broke on this show that oil would go
[4:00:44.920 --> 4:00:50.360]  from 150 a barrel to below 50 it did that he said for one year it did it for
[4:00:50.360 --> 4:00:56.240]  about 11 months before it went back above so he was right Lindsay you talked
[4:00:56.240 --> 4:01:01.840]  to this elitist this this former oil company CEO who you're friends with you
[4:01:01.840 --> 4:01:04.200]  first talked to him a couple years ago when he threatened you and said the
[4:01:04.200 --> 4:01:07.280]  elite's gonna take you out of you don't shut up these old guys love to do that
[4:01:07.280 --> 4:01:12.680]  love to threaten people and they mean it and studying history and talk to people
[4:01:12.680 --> 4:01:15.640]  that know these people that's exactly how they operate and they're real serious
[4:01:15.640 --> 4:01:18.760]  are like I like you we don't want to have to kill you but they really mean it
[4:01:18.760 --> 4:01:23.440]  when they tell you that we got 10 minutes in overdrive recap the first
[4:01:23.440 --> 4:01:27.400]  bullet points you covered then give us the rest of the bullet points and then

[4:01:33.240 --> 4:01:38.680]  whenever they say it they mean it and you don't take it for granted and Alex I
[4:01:38.680 --> 4:01:43.400]  have not done a single radio talk show for three months no one has heard this
[4:01:43.400 --> 4:01:49.280]  material before only a few days ago I hope you're hearing this folks only a
[4:01:49.280 --> 4:01:54.200]  few days ago not two years ago few days ago I dared to pick up the telephone and
[4:01:54.200 --> 4:01:59.240]  call this man Alex producer said to me back about two months ago he said have
[4:01:59.240 --> 4:02:03.320]  you talked with this man yet and he said please Alex in the last show I think
[4:02:03.320 --> 4:02:07.400]  you said please give this man a call I'd like to know what he says sometimes I
[4:02:07.400 --> 4:02:11.000]  didn't want to know what he had to say I'll be him I'll admit to you I was
[4:02:11.000 --> 4:02:15.880]  afraid to even know what this man had to say when I got back here after three
[4:02:15.880 --> 4:02:20.000]  months I'm not going to single show I said one morning I just feel the urge
[4:02:20.000 --> 4:02:23.880]  pick up the phone and call this man I had not talked with him in nearly two
[4:02:23.880 --> 4:02:29.400]  years I did he answered the phone he said here the points we're going to deal
[4:02:29.400 --> 4:02:35.640]  with them in depth tomorrow one after the other number one within two years you
[4:02:35.640 --> 4:02:40.840]  will not recognize America oh folks I wish to goodness somehow you could
[4:02:40.840 --> 4:02:46.640]  realize that unless you take action immediately I mean I don't know what
[4:02:46.640 --> 4:02:50.560]  you're going to do but whatever it takes immediately all your children and
[4:02:50.560 --> 4:02:55.840]  grandchildren will forever be slaves to the elite the second point the elite
[4:02:55.840 --> 4:02:59.880]  have altered their timeline now this is unusual they don't often times do this
[4:02:59.880 --> 4:03:04.400]  and I'll tell you on the show tomorrow how they have altered that timeline they
[4:03:04.400 --> 4:03:08.800]  have altered it somewhat in relation to inflation they've altered it slightly
[4:03:08.800 --> 4:03:13.120]  concerning the time that they have set for the total utter complete
[4:03:13.120 --> 4:03:17.560]  annihilation and collapse of the American dollar and I'll tell you why they
[4:03:17.560 --> 4:03:21.640]  have done that go into that in depth on tomorrow I didn't even touch today on
[4:03:21.640 --> 4:03:27.040]  Saudi Arabia and OPEC and the Arabs and how it's affecting them because of what
[4:03:27.040 --> 4:03:30.760]  they're doing with oil right now but oil's going back up to 70 something
[4:03:30.760 --> 4:03:34.680]  dollars a barrel and I'll get into that tomorrow some of you know saying well
[4:03:34.680 --> 4:03:38.400]  you said it was going down to $50 well that's exactly what they told me for a
[4:03:38.400 --> 4:03:42.920]  certain period of time and I'll tell you where it's going tomorrow I know it's
[4:03:42.920 --> 4:03:48.720]  going up some but it's going back down some to next he said inflation will
[4:03:48.720 --> 4:03:55.080]  escalate over a period of two years this is one of their timeline alterations I
[4:03:55.080 --> 4:04:01.000]  had said two years ago that it was probably going to have hyper super in
[4:04:01.000 --> 4:04:06.280]  inflation within a year to a year and a half he says now because the American
[4:04:06.280 --> 4:04:13.560]  people gave the elite approximately two and one half trillion dollars Bloomberg's
[4:04:13.560 --> 4:04:19.840]  new service said oh my goodness I hope you caught that two and one half trillion
[4:04:19.840 --> 4:04:25.440]  I didn't say billion trillion dollars within the past within the two months of
[4:04:25.440 --> 4:04:31.680]  the end of a Bush administration you literally had to put on a silver platter
[4:04:31.680 --> 4:04:37.280]  approximately two and one half trillion dollars and as a result out of
[4:04:37.280 --> 4:04:42.280]  appreciation I don't know how to say it any otherwise you know this is so
[4:04:42.280 --> 4:04:47.520]  sparkling but yet it's also comical in so many ways until I have to just laugh
[4:04:47.520 --> 4:04:52.320]  sometimes if I didn't I would know how to stand it but you give them two and a
[4:04:52.320 --> 4:04:56.520]  half trillion dollars and out of appreciation so to speak they kind of
[4:04:56.520 --> 4:05:01.240]  altered their timeline and the inflation is going to escalate over a period of
[4:05:01.240 --> 4:05:04.200]  two years with all my goodness Katie bought the door at the end of two year
[4:05:04.200 --> 4:05:08.280]  period you can't imagine what you're going to be facing and they've already set
[4:05:08.280 --> 4:05:12.720]  the date I mean he used the expression over and over and over two years two
[4:05:12.720 --> 4:05:17.160]  years two years okay crude oil prices we'll deal with that tomorrow he said
[4:05:17.160 --> 4:05:24.280]  again gold and silver are all you can rely on I'd like to go into tomorrow why
[4:05:24.280 --> 4:05:30.920]  gold and silver are the currency of the elite you're in my currency well not
[4:05:30.920 --> 4:05:35.120]  mine anymore if I help it it is a better reserve note it's a joke
[4:05:35.120 --> 4:05:40.400]  suddenly a joke gold and silver never change prices I know a few moments ago
[4:05:40.400 --> 4:05:43.960]  we talked about the fact that gold went up today and silver went up today no it
[4:05:43.960 --> 4:05:48.760]  didn't the dollar went down gold and silver state where it was the purchasing
[4:05:48.760 --> 4:05:52.760]  power of that gold is still the same I'll try to explain tomorrow how the
[4:05:52.760 --> 4:05:56.400]  gold and silver are the currency of the elite and that's the reason you don't pay
[4:05:56.400 --> 4:05:59.520]  any sales tax on it when you buy it that's the reason that they don't
[4:05:59.520 --> 4:06:03.400]  regulate it and then I'm going to go into tomorrow who is going to be the
[4:06:03.400 --> 4:06:10.880]  let oh good please Alex you're going to love this all so he gave me a schedule
[4:06:10.880 --> 4:06:16.600]  of events in chronological order of what you can expect and who would you
[4:06:16.600 --> 4:06:21.000]  think and I'll answer you on tomorrow don't answer me now because it might not
[4:06:21.000 --> 4:06:27.800]  be right who will be the last group of people to be touched in the order
[4:06:27.800 --> 4:06:33.800]  chronologically of their total control factor you are going to be amazed how
[4:06:33.800 --> 4:06:37.720]  this relates well stop right there stop right there just just just give us a
[4:06:37.720 --> 4:06:41.640]  prelude I know the DVD covers it all in detail but I mean we'll cover it more
[4:06:41.640 --> 4:06:45.480]  tomorrow but but but give me a few of the schedule of events give me the first
[4:06:45.480 --> 4:06:54.440]  part well yeah I do the last group to be touched and it's gonna surprise you I
[4:06:54.440 --> 4:06:59.200]  know radio talk shows all the talk show hosts are saying oh my goodness we're
[4:06:59.200 --> 4:07:03.640]  about to be to be taken off the air all the rest would you believe the last
[4:07:03.640 --> 4:07:08.520]  group to be touched to go to be radio talk shows well Hitler did that he
[4:07:08.520 --> 4:07:12.680]  allowed some prominent Jews to stay in Germany and stay in the theater and stay
[4:07:12.680 --> 4:07:18.880]  on in movies so so so they're planning to let us flap and scream and I've been
[4:07:18.880 --> 4:07:22.240]  told that but it's almost like entertainment for them that that you
[4:07:22.240 --> 4:07:26.360]  know that we're like the great dominator crushes America they're like yes
[4:07:26.360 --> 4:07:31.800]  that's right and I go I mean is that what you're saying well yeah but there's
[4:07:31.800 --> 4:07:38.120]  not a reason behind this Alex and the reason is you see there they control the
[4:07:38.120 --> 4:07:42.360]  major media I mean let's just television radio I don't care what it is major
[4:07:42.360 --> 4:07:47.000]  major media they control it it's their greatest tool of telling the people what
[4:07:47.000 --> 4:07:52.520]  they want them to know and make them believe it now if you if they control
[4:07:52.520 --> 4:07:58.160]  the media and they want to use the media as their method of getting their
[4:07:58.160 --> 4:08:03.520]  message out now the moment that they limit the radio talk show such as Alex
[4:08:03.520 --> 4:08:08.440]  Jones is the day that they likewise limit themselves and in order to keep it
[4:08:08.440 --> 4:08:13.160]  so that the major media can say anything they want to they're going to keep you
[4:08:13.160 --> 4:08:18.040]  out there plug it away so that they and they don't have any choice so they're
[4:08:18.040 --> 4:08:22.440]  just going to control the media by being able to propagandize they don't want to
[4:08:22.440 --> 4:08:26.600]  fairness doctrine because then that could be used in court to restrict them
[4:08:26.600 --> 4:08:30.520]  that's exactly right it would be to that disadvantage to cut off the Alex Jones
[4:08:30.520 --> 4:08:34.320]  so they're winning right now why should they why should they change anything I
[4:08:34.320 --> 4:08:37.120]  mean I can sit here with government documents how they're poisoning the
[4:08:37.120 --> 4:08:41.640]  water and parents go good I want my kid to be retarded I'm gonna drink more
[4:08:41.640 --> 4:08:45.640]  fluoride I mean I mean I mean I guess that you know openly they're saying
[4:08:45.640 --> 4:08:50.200]  carbon taxes on everything carbon taxes on flying planes having a government
[4:08:50.200 --> 4:08:54.080]  certification to be able to get on a plane that that your travel is essential
[4:08:54.080 --> 4:09:00.520]  and people are like good I love citizen spies I love total government I love
[4:09:00.520 --> 4:09:04.520]  across between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany so I mean why should they
[4:09:04.520 --> 4:09:11.280]  care about us well they think Alex that you and me and others like us they
[4:09:11.280 --> 4:09:14.400]  think that we don't have enough power to be able to move the masses they think
[4:09:14.400 --> 4:09:18.120]  they have it made right now they are fully convinced that they have it in the
[4:09:18.120 --> 4:09:22.080]  pocket and there's nothing in the world that you and I can do about it and they
[4:09:22.080 --> 4:09:27.000]  aren't worried about us one I order because these are little these small
[4:09:27.000 --> 4:09:30.480]  meetings that we hold around the country and everything else they say all my
[4:09:30.480 --> 4:09:34.360]  gracious that we have it so made all they're not worried because the general
[4:09:34.360 --> 4:09:39.600]  public only wants to put a sports jersey on and drink fluoridated water and loves
[4:09:39.600 --> 4:09:44.120]  losing their houses loves losing everything loves the left-right paradigm
[4:09:44.120 --> 4:09:47.520]  and if they do wake up they're just gonna follow Glenn Beck who's controlled
[4:09:47.520 --> 4:09:51.880]  opposition right over a cliff but but I know in the end we're gonna wake up and
[4:09:51.880 --> 4:09:57.280]  defeat them it's kind of a mind game they play of being so you know so
[4:09:57.280 --> 4:10:01.080]  incredibly arrogant but but Lindsay I interrupted you on that point we're gonna
[4:10:01.080 --> 4:10:05.200]  cover the chronological event tomorrow we're gonna cover some other things but
[4:10:05.200 --> 4:10:10.360]  you have a few more points get give us those final preludes well baseball
[4:10:10.360 --> 4:10:15.360]  apple pie and beer and they've they keep you happy and they don't really think
[4:10:15.360 --> 4:10:21.040]  that that they'll even said they'll get to to rise up okay we want to get
[4:10:21.040 --> 4:10:25.240]  tomorrow into the subject of the devil's Messiah oh this is going to
[4:10:25.240 --> 4:10:29.880]  startle you when I gave this the other day in the studio the people said we've
[4:10:29.880 --> 4:10:35.120]  never heard anything such as the elite have a god the elite are not a
[4:10:35.120 --> 4:10:41.440]  atheist in order to understand this and what their moral code is I'm going to go
[4:10:41.440 --> 4:10:46.200]  into their moral code their moral code is basically evolution they have so
[4:10:46.200 --> 4:10:52.440]  persuasive genetics eugenics came out of evolution it's social Darwinism when
[4:10:52.440 --> 4:10:56.480]  they torture and murder children it's their divine right do as thou wilt
[4:10:56.480 --> 4:11:02.440]  because they are the dominant one and and and so they're helping the earth well
[4:11:02.440 --> 4:11:06.080]  they've rewritten the textbooks and they have put in the religion of
[4:11:06.080 --> 4:11:10.320]  evolution and believe you me it is a religion they did have a bit of this
[4:11:10.320 --> 4:11:14.880]  and they've done it over a period of years as a result they have persuaded
[4:11:14.880 --> 4:11:18.080]  people that they're nothing would evolutionized animals and if they're
[4:11:18.080 --> 4:11:22.200]  nothing would evolutionize animals and they have a right to act like it and so
[4:11:22.200 --> 4:11:26.320]  we can kill the old people and and euthanize everybody because we're all
[4:11:26.320 --> 4:11:31.600]  just blobs they're exactly we got to honor the earth but not ourselves humans
[4:11:31.600 --> 4:11:37.120]  are trash so he told you that too the elite worship something but my question
[4:11:37.120 --> 4:11:43.680]  is what do they worship and there again the name of the game is control George
[4:11:43.680 --> 4:11:50.120]  Bush used to use the expression God bless America okay which God that's the
[4:11:50.120 --> 4:11:53.040]  thing that the average American never stops in the book preacher in America
[4:11:53.040 --> 4:11:56.400]  today that's been so fooled into believing that he was talking about the
[4:11:56.400 --> 4:12:02.400]  God of the Bible that they worship my goodness quite to the contrary he was
[4:12:02.400 --> 4:12:08.120]  talking about a God but please wake up and realize which God this man was
[4:12:08.120 --> 4:12:10.920]  talking about and talk more about that tomorrow what are the other bullet
[4:12:10.920 --> 4:12:15.440]  points we haven't gotten to well I think probably the most dawdling thing is
[4:12:15.440 --> 4:12:20.960]  going to be their schedule of events chronologically and how they plan to
[4:12:20.960 --> 4:12:25.520]  take to keep the stock market going up and up and up other things are going to
[4:12:25.520 --> 4:12:29.640]  be drastically affected and there's definitely a timeline involved in
[4:12:29.640 --> 4:12:34.320]  every bit of this I don't know how to give any more I mean I got so many
[4:12:34.320 --> 4:12:38.520]  pages of notes here what I'll randomly read some more to us right giving us a
[4:12:38.520 --> 4:12:42.760]  prelude for tomorrow well what I'll probably do tomorrow is start out with
[4:12:42.760 --> 4:12:47.360]  my very very first set of notes here that I use the other day and go through
[4:12:47.360 --> 4:12:52.480]  them one meticulously one at a time and explain the money details in it and then
[4:12:52.480 --> 4:12:58.840]  come down to money oh my gracious I'll get into the subject of money in depth
[4:12:58.840 --> 4:13:03.000]  tomorrow because the most sensitive part of anybody's anatomy is the rear pocket
[4:13:03.000 --> 4:13:06.480]  and so I'm sure that you want to know what they had to say about money where
[4:13:06.480 --> 4:13:10.600]  it's going how they're going to do it the timeline along that then I'll get
[4:13:10.600 --> 4:13:15.320]  into the third in the last of these which is a devil's Messiah the churches
[4:13:15.320 --> 4:13:19.560]  how they have affected them how they've rewritten the textbooks and our schools
[4:13:19.560 --> 4:13:23.640]  and basically how this man just literally put himself out and said
[4:13:23.640 --> 4:13:27.360]  things that I am still sitting here stunned and amazed that anybody would
[4:13:27.360 --> 4:13:31.360]  ever dare to say well give us an enclosing a final look into when he
[4:13:31.360 --> 4:13:36.600]  talked about devil Messiah did he say our Messiah will soon be here no he
[4:13:36.600 --> 4:13:40.400]  did not say that for all practical purposes they have accomplished about
[4:13:40.400 --> 4:13:44.680]  what they want to accomplish and whatever men may step on the scene to do
[4:13:44.680 --> 4:13:48.640]  what they want done well then what do they mean by devil Messiah he just meant
[4:13:48.640 --> 4:13:53.680]  we've taken over the churches he basically meant okay here goes and this is
[4:13:53.680 --> 4:14:00.280]  the buzz this is the what should I say the prime line of they in order to be
[4:14:00.280 --> 4:14:04.000]  able to bring America to the state that it is right now they had to remove
[4:14:04.000 --> 4:14:09.160]  America's God that that's putting it in a nutshell
[4:14:10.120 --> 4:14:15.400]  we understood this they had to make their new religion of eugenics the God
[4:14:15.400 --> 4:14:19.840]  and and they had to make the family be removed only the state can stand go
[4:14:19.840 --> 4:14:25.920]  ahead yeah I think it was best expressed by Alexis Tocqueville and I'll just
[4:14:25.920 --> 4:14:29.560]  read you just as few sentences here when he wrote his book after coming to
[4:14:29.560 --> 4:14:34.120]  America this famous French author and he said I sought for the greatness and
[4:14:34.120 --> 4:14:38.440]  genius of America into a commodious harbors and their ample rivers and it
[4:14:38.440 --> 4:14:42.800]  was not there her fertile fields and boundless prayers and it was not there
[4:14:42.800 --> 4:14:48.280]  in our rich minds in a vast world of commerce and it was not there not until
[4:14:48.280 --> 4:14:52.880]  I went to the churches of America and heard her pulpits of flame with
[4:14:52.880 --> 4:14:57.680]  righteousness did understand the secret offer genius and power America is great
[4:14:57.680 --> 4:15:03.520]  because America is good and if America ever ceases to be good America will
[4:15:03.520 --> 4:15:10.200]  cease to be great they knew that they had to remove America's God in order for it
[4:15:10.200 --> 4:15:14.640]  to be destroyed and one of the first places they started with the pastors
[4:15:14.640 --> 4:15:19.120]  and the pulpits and the pastors can't say anything anymore their hands are tied
[4:15:19.120 --> 4:15:28.440]  by 501c3 and Alexis Tocqueville knew it he said it well Pastor Williams
[4:15:28.440 --> 4:15:32.800]  tomorrow at 30 minutes of the show with us for an hour and a half then we're
[4:15:32.800 --> 4:15:37.440]  going to set you up again keep an hour open Friday that as we end the show
[4:15:37.440 --> 4:15:40.880]  here when it's over I want to set up that Friday interview we'll do Tuesday and
[4:15:40.880 --> 4:15:45.120]  Friday to get the full scope of this with you and I want to ask all the
[4:15:45.120 --> 4:15:48.280]  listeners to conduct their friends and family have them tune in tomorrow but in
[4:15:48.280 --> 4:15:54.240]  closing I want to say this even if people don't believe in God look at the
[4:15:54.240 --> 4:15:58.880]  United States 4% of the world's population half the wealth Mexico has
[4:15:58.880 --> 4:16:05.640]  tripled the wealth of minerals and in oil and trees many other countries have
[4:16:05.640 --> 4:16:09.960]  more wealth but they're in their slaves it was the system of liberty that
[4:16:09.960 --> 4:16:14.760]  produced all this now we're going into bondage and there's no doubt that that
[4:16:14.760 --> 4:16:18.840]  is the fact and the system knew that they want us dependent they want us
[4:16:18.840 --> 4:16:24.080]  weak pastor Lindsay Williams God bless you we appreciate you coming on with us
