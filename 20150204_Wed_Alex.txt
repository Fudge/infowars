[00:00.000 --> 00:11.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.840 --> 00:19.380]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.380 --> 00:40.940]  Texas Alex Jones big broadcast lined up today we knew it was coming now all
[00:40.940 --> 00:44.500]  over the country bills are being introduced to forcibly inoculate you
[00:44.500 --> 00:48.580]  with hundreds of different deadly vaccines that's all coming up today
[00:48.580 --> 00:52.580]  we're gonna have wide-open phones huge news across the board but first here's
[00:52.580 --> 00:57.060]  part of a David Knight special report the NSA is not interested in terrorist
[00:57.060 --> 01:01.500]  it's interested in interesting people here's part of that report very
[01:01.500 --> 01:05.460]  interesting video that got posted by Washington and Lee University over the
[01:05.460 --> 01:10.740]  weekend Michael Hayden who has been at the top of the intelligence community as
[01:10.740 --> 01:14.980]  the surveillance state of the 21st century has been put into place you
[01:14.980 --> 01:20.380]  someone who began as the NSA director around the time of 9-11 shortly prior
[01:20.380 --> 01:25.060]  to that he then moved on to director of national intelligence then on to the CIA
[01:25.060 --> 01:30.500]  he's pretty unapologetic about how he's broken the law and he made some
[01:30.500 --> 01:36.300]  amazing statements at this law symposium I'm not a law enforcement officer I
[01:36.300 --> 01:41.020]  don't suspect anybody he's not law enforcement he doesn't have any suspects
[01:41.020 --> 01:45.620]  so I guess that would be why he doesn't go before a judge and get a search warrant
[01:45.620 --> 01:51.140]  now remember that in 2006 Michael Hayden told some reporters that the term
[01:51.140 --> 01:56.380]  probable cause is not in the fourth amendment well it certainly is in the
[01:56.380 --> 02:00.940]  fourth amendment of course it is a right of the people to be secure in their
[02:00.940 --> 02:05.980]  persons houses papers and effects so that's a right of the people these are
[02:05.980 --> 02:08.940]  rights that we possess whether or not there's a constitution or a fourth
[02:08.940 --> 02:13.220]  amendment and the reason that we have the fourth amendment is because it puts
[02:13.220 --> 02:17.940]  prohibitions on people like Michael Hayden who think that they don't have or
[02:17.940 --> 02:22.540]  should not have any kind of controls on their actions they should go before a
[02:22.540 --> 02:26.420]  judge and say that they have a reason to search for the person and they should
[02:26.420 --> 02:31.340]  be very specific about it but he's turned this upside down instead of going to a
[02:31.340 --> 02:34.340]  judge and getting a search warrant saying this is what I'm looking for he
[02:34.340 --> 02:39.460]  goes a dragnet surveillance of everyone about everything here's what else he had
[02:39.460 --> 02:44.180]  to say this is not about guilt in fact in fact let me let me be really clear
[02:44.180 --> 02:52.460]  okay NSA doesn't just listen to bad people NSA listens to interesting
[02:52.460 --> 03:01.980]  people people isn't that funny he doesn't listen to bad people he listens to
[03:01.980 --> 03:06.900]  interesting people haha who does he find interesting is it the political opponents
[03:06.900 --> 03:11.980]  of his boss is it somebody that would reign in the surveillance state maybe
[03:11.980 --> 03:15.900]  it's somebody that he'd like to blackmail maybe it's someone that would give
[03:15.900 --> 03:20.940]  him some information about insider trading on financial markets maybe it's
[03:20.940 --> 03:25.900]  corporate secrets from another country maybe he's just some kind of a perverted
[03:25.900 --> 03:30.580]  voyeur whatever he doesn't believe that there's any restraints on him and what
[03:30.580 --> 03:34.540]  you need to understand is that the lie that we're giving up our freedoms so
[03:34.540 --> 03:39.580]  they can protect us from the bad guys is just that it's a lie he doesn't care
[03:39.580 --> 03:43.340]  about bad people he cares about interesting people maybe he'll take an
[03:43.340 --> 03:47.900]  interest in you let's listen to what he said about section 215 a lot of
[03:47.900 --> 03:52.460]  commentary was made about Jim Clapper and the question from Juan Wyden on that
[03:52.460 --> 03:56.660]  on that you know about mass and bulk collection and so on Jim's answer was
[03:56.660 --> 04:01.660]  horrible all right and Jim's Jim's an honest guy he just he just hosed it
[04:01.660 --> 04:08.380]  horribly yeah he lied let's continue he hosed it because he flat out lied
[04:08.380 --> 04:12.260]  under oath but of course if you're part of the intelligence community you won't
[04:12.260 --> 04:17.940]  go to jail for lying under oath Jim's answer was not as bad as run Wyden's
[04:17.940 --> 04:24.460]  question oh it's the question that's a problem I don't really know what a
[04:24.460 --> 04:30.620]  dossier is in this context so what I wanted to see is if you could give me a

[08:47.860 --> 08:53.020]  will be here for the next three hours well we need to have the headlines at
[08:53.020 --> 08:57.060]  info wars calm of the articles are being written right now screaming that forced
[08:57.060 --> 09:03.780]  inoculation is upon us that is the system's answer to their fraud of
[09:03.780 --> 09:08.700]  claiming it's the law to be vaccinated collapsing they're now trying to pass
[09:08.700 --> 09:12.820]  laws in California and other states the feds are looking at it to make you take
[09:12.820 --> 09:20.100]  hundreds of different shots in just the first 10 15 years of life with hundreds
[09:20.100 --> 09:24.580]  of other so-called vaccines coming online most of these are not classical
[09:24.580 --> 09:30.940]  attenuated viruses or other pathogen to have learned immunity now I've gone and
[09:30.940 --> 09:34.860]  gotten allergy shots and it's had some positive effect being injected with the
[09:34.860 --> 09:39.940]  mountain cedar that I am allergic to I believe in the science I know it's real
[09:39.940 --> 09:46.220]  but it has side effects but this is about social engineering and what they're
[09:46.220 --> 09:52.260]  adding to it so it's on like Donkey Kong as they say we can see where this was
[09:52.260 --> 09:56.980]  going California senators introduced bill proposing changes to measles
[09:56.980 --> 10:01.540]  vaccinations headline is should be making a mandatory that's what the bill
[10:01.540 --> 10:07.780]  does we have similar pieces of news we're gonna go over but buried in the news
[10:07.780 --> 10:11.620]  today is that the Obama administration has done something at least on the
[10:11.620 --> 10:18.120]  surface good I expect a trick they have granted imperial immunity to the
[10:18.120 --> 10:24.900]  whistleblower from Merck and now other whistleblowers from the CDC are about to
[10:24.900 --> 10:30.180]  get the whistleblower protection they're reporting on the fraud of the vaccine
[10:30.180 --> 10:40.180]  studies covering up the link to autism so that's all coming up as well today and
[10:40.180 --> 10:44.540]  if you scroll down if you're watching on TV we can show you the source of that
[10:44.540 --> 10:53.780]  report that's the daily caller we have a snippet posted at info wars.com so we
[10:53.780 --> 10:57.860]  have that very important news to get into obviously we have the Taiwan trans
[10:57.860 --> 11:03.260]  air plane crashes probably the most dramatic plane crash video that I have
[11:03.260 --> 11:10.860]  ever seen I mean this is just even more spectacularly horrifying and life
[11:10.860 --> 11:16.900]  destroying than watching the Concorde blow up was 20 years ago or so over
[11:16.900 --> 11:26.500]  Paris surprisingly they say quite a few folks survived the unbelievable crash
[11:26.500 --> 11:35.700]  a testament to human endurance simply horrifying but it's part of life it's
[11:35.700 --> 11:39.820]  part of risk it's part of danger depending on the statistic what flying
[11:39.820 --> 11:43.740]  in a commercial aircraft is 20 something times safer than driving an
[11:43.740 --> 11:49.780]  automobile and right and then flying in a small general aviation aircraft is a
[11:49.780 --> 11:53.740]  little bit more dangerous but still last time I saw numbers it was ten times
[11:53.740 --> 11:58.260]  safer or more than riding an automobile it's just that if you're in a plane
[11:58.260 --> 12:03.900]  crash you've got a very good chance of dying the numbers go up as high as 75
[12:03.900 --> 12:08.060]  80% in a plane crash there was this car wrecks you're gonna walk away more
[12:08.060 --> 12:11.700]  often but you're gonna have more car wrecks so statistically it's much more
[12:11.700 --> 12:16.300]  dangerous but what's the answer ban air travel because somebody might get killed
[12:16.300 --> 12:20.380]  oh my gosh somebody stabbed more school children today somewhere let's ban
[12:20.380 --> 12:25.060]  knives that doesn't make sense does it but that's the idea they apply to guns
[12:25.060 --> 12:29.860]  hey Alex it's getting pretty dangerous getting on planes these days because
[12:29.860 --> 12:35.020]  oligarchs are now attacking people in commercial commercial airlines well
[12:35.020 --> 12:38.740]  yeah I mean I don't know if we can call Paris Hilton's brother an oligarch but
[12:38.740 --> 12:42.740]  they are a multi-billion dollar family he is the heir to more than a billion
[12:42.740 --> 12:47.580]  dollars and we do have the report here it was picked up by the Hollywood
[12:47.580 --> 12:52.820]  reporter TMZ you name it little oligarch gone wild Paris Hilton's brother
[12:52.820 --> 12:57.900]  yells I will effing own anyone on this flight they are effing peasants if you
[12:57.900 --> 13:01.500]  want to square up to me bro this is all a quote then bring it and I will effing
[13:01.500 --> 13:08.580]  fight you he allegedly said so yeah that's the attitude that these people
[13:08.580 --> 13:16.660]  have I've actually met Paris Hilton she's very very nice lady but I don't
[13:16.660 --> 13:19.860]  really agree with her politics and the rest of it I haven't met her brother but
[13:19.860 --> 13:26.300]  that sounds extremely snot-nosed I'm not name-dropping it's just interesting
[13:26.300 --> 13:32.820]  Charlie Sheen was in town last night and he seems to be doing better not as
[13:32.820 --> 13:37.780]  clearly burning the candle at both ends he's been over the last three four years
[13:37.780 --> 13:42.060]  but said a lot of interesting projects coming up it was very nice to hang out
[13:42.060 --> 13:48.900]  with him last night and a very spirited folks at the little party I went to but
[13:48.900 --> 13:53.060]  I ducked out pretty quick because I need to get home but who knows might be having
[13:53.060 --> 13:56.900]  Charlie pop in soon here on the transmission he's working on some
[13:56.900 --> 14:03.180]  very interesting things out of the repertoire of different stunts I guess
[14:03.180 --> 14:07.420]  you could call them that have been pulled here on this broadcast so we'll
[14:07.420 --> 14:11.660]  probably be talking to Charlie here sooner rather than later he's a really
[14:11.660 --> 14:17.100]  sweet guy really smart guy a misunderstood person and he seemed to be in
[14:17.100 --> 14:22.260]  really good spirits and be surrounded by a good group of people last night and
[14:22.260 --> 14:25.380]  I've seen before surrounded by some folks that weren't so good and I think
[14:25.380 --> 14:28.020]  that's really the different you know I first met Charlie about ten years ago
[14:28.020 --> 14:31.340]  for getting all this news he just smoked cigarettes and drank coffee
[14:31.340 --> 14:36.980]  exercised real hard he was just getting divorced from Denise Richards I met her
[14:36.980 --> 14:41.780]  talk her she's pretty nice got to know her pugs but they were friends but
[14:41.780 --> 14:46.460]  getting divorced and he was super smart it is super smart but really
[14:46.460 --> 14:51.140]  frighteningly smart and it could just show what stress in the Hollywood culture
[14:51.140 --> 14:55.900]  can do to you the different bumps that he's been through but just some
[14:55.900 --> 14:59.820]  interesting little news on that front you can see a photo I was last night up on
[14:59.820 --> 15:03.460]  the Twitter at real Alex Jones and you know why is it important to know Chuck
[15:03.460 --> 15:07.140]  Norris is a daily listener or a son and accomplished director is a daily
[15:07.140 --> 15:12.180]  listener or the Charlie sheen is or that pretty much anybody to talk about in
[15:12.180 --> 15:17.700]  Hollywood from Brad Pitt to Mel Gibson are familiar and tune in the show and
[15:17.700 --> 15:22.100]  watch the films it's because he just shows you the power of the Liberty
[15:22.100 --> 15:27.220]  movement in the in Hollywood people are sick of liberal garbage and they're sick
[15:27.220 --> 15:31.460]  of mainline Republican garbage what's been hot for more than a decade and just
[15:31.460 --> 15:37.260]  gets hotter is alternative news and getting outside the box people are sick
[15:37.260 --> 15:43.620]  of it and a Sumner Redstone fades from control of Hollywood he is the kingpin
[15:43.620 --> 15:50.540]  the kingpin a Sumner Redstone as he prepares to exit the planet they say
[15:50.540 --> 15:55.060]  he's in real bad health at 90 something years old and there's a lot of the old
[15:55.060 --> 16:00.980]  old guard is preparing to blow away like like dead cicadas attached to the
[16:00.980 --> 16:06.980]  sides of trees you might see some big shake ups there in Hollywood I can just
[16:06.980 --> 16:12.500]  tell you that right now there is a feverish rebellion against the system
[16:12.500 --> 16:17.260]  across the board and you've heard Rick Linklater who's up for Oscars on this
[16:17.260 --> 16:21.740]  broadcast talk about that as well so just shows how we're winning the culture
[16:21.740 --> 16:27.660]  war when it comes to real numbers and minds but if you tune into Hollywood or
[16:27.660 --> 16:31.860]  mainstream news you wouldn't know that I mean yesterday we played the Fox
[16:31.860 --> 16:37.460]  News Club where they said that these Seahawks from the five show with a
[16:37.460 --> 16:45.420]  gutless bunch of fake conservatives that that the Seahawks coached through the
[16:45.420 --> 16:49.980]  game because he wants to go to work for Alex Jones I mean just any way to
[16:49.980 --> 16:54.940]  demonize this transmission and they do that because they know they know we're
[16:54.940 --> 16:57.980]  calling them out they know we're showing the hat trick we're explaining to the
[16:57.980 --> 17:02.180]  people that Santa Claus doesn't exist I don't want to sit here and fight with
[17:02.180 --> 17:05.460]  Fox News I don't want to sit here and fight with CNN I want to sit here and
[17:05.460 --> 17:11.980]  fight with MSNBC but you know MSNBC gets up there and taxers truly and in
[17:11.980 --> 17:18.100]  Rand Paul last night we've got those clips and just implied it was insane and
[17:18.100 --> 17:23.060]  crazy that Rand Paul says that some vaccines may be dangerous and you need
[17:23.060 --> 17:32.100]  to investigate each one that's just common sense but this is the type of
[17:32.100 --> 17:37.700]  propaganda they engage in so coming up California senators to introduce Bill
[17:37.700 --> 17:44.860]  proposing changes to measles vaccinations then we're going to look at
[17:44.860 --> 17:48.540]  this report Oregon business must pay a hundred thousand dollars to homosexual
[17:48.540 --> 17:53.660]  couple for refusing to beg a cake Obama's big lie to clash with the big

[19:41.900 --> 19:46.580]  else and this is their recruitment garbage to build a giant army that will

[24:24.700 --> 24:28.460]  had previously called it the government forcing you to put something in your
[24:28.460 --> 24:35.060]  body but if you want to understand where the whole radical feminist agenda
[24:35.060 --> 24:41.940]  cultural Marxist agenda is going and you wonder why they ban brown bags in

[25:16.340 --> 25:20.780]  it's to repeat the latest you've heard from government-controlled media it's
[25:20.780 --> 25:25.460]  about making you be paralyzed so there's no real debate the opposite of a
[25:25.460 --> 25:29.940]  renaissance it's called a dark age it's called stagnation it's called total

[34:41.860 --> 34:49.140]  beer and he says don't you realize it's an equation the answer to 1984 is 1776
[34:49.140 --> 34:54.740]  I go what do you mean he goes the answer to tyranny and oppression is worldwide
[34:54.740 --> 35:00.300]  1776 so don't ever want to plagiarize that fellow even though I can't remember
[35:00.300 --> 35:03.500]  his name I just felt like giving him credit the camera's name we'll look it
[35:03.500 --> 35:09.380]  up there is so many great people that have come and gone but we honor them
[35:09.380 --> 35:15.300]  with our memories and by standing up to the things they stood up for all the
[35:15.300 --> 35:20.260]  strength of the people that came before us and I guess so fitting that somebody
[35:20.260 --> 35:27.620]  from England would understand that the answer to 1984 is 1776 both made in
[35:27.620 --> 35:33.540]  England 1984 the fictitious world that George Arwell believed the Soviets
[35:33.540 --> 35:38.180]  would build if they could bring communism to England of course he was a
[35:38.180 --> 35:44.620]  member of OSS and the MI6 that was made in England and then 1776 was made in
[35:44.620 --> 35:50.340]  England out of the Magna Carta in 1215 and by the ideas that Englishmen had that
[35:50.340 --> 35:56.100]  they were free and not slaves and that's why when I gave a speech to over 3,000
[35:56.100 --> 36:00.020]  people outside the gates of the Bilderberg group two years ago in England I
[36:00.020 --> 36:06.500]  explained and the crowd agreed and there I had three plus thousand people from
[36:06.500 --> 36:14.580]  England they're in the UK chanting the answer to 1984 is 1776 1776 is not
[36:14.580 --> 36:19.180]  just belong to this Republic it belongs to anyone worldwide that wants to stand
[36:19.180 --> 36:26.900]  up against tyranny powerful information ladies and gentlemen let me tell you and
[36:26.900 --> 36:30.940]  that shows how powerful ideas are that somebody could give me that idea sitting
[36:30.940 --> 36:38.100]  there in a restaurant bar and then all these years later that is a slogan used
[36:38.100 --> 36:44.700]  around the world and spray painted on the subway walls somebody in New Zealand
[36:44.700 --> 36:48.940]  put it in giant bold letters on a big building they were going to demolish it
[36:48.940 --> 36:53.540]  was up for months and I had that the city there in New Zealand we did an
[36:53.540 --> 36:59.420]  article on send us a letter threatening to sue us or charge us for having the
[36:59.420 --> 37:06.300]  answer to 1984 1776 spray painted in full wars.com was just giant and I explained
[37:06.300 --> 37:11.060]  that the ideas are bulletproof and that I didn't do it but that I saluted
[37:11.060 --> 37:14.580]  whoever did it I said they're blowing the building up they're getting rid of
[37:14.580 --> 37:19.460]  the building or I mean what I mean that's human expression whoever did it
[37:19.460 --> 37:24.660]  probably took them you know all night hanging by ropes to do it good for them
[37:24.660 --> 37:32.380]  we've got to get ideas out there we've got a break out of this comfort zone we've
[37:32.380 --> 37:41.100]  got to get animated and take action okay I want to get into the tyranny because
[37:41.100 --> 37:46.180]  if we don't get on the offense we're going to be back on the defense and
[37:46.180 --> 37:50.260]  they're going to come and they're going to start shutting down your bank
[37:50.260 --> 37:56.500]  accounts pulling your driver's license not letting you work mark of the beast
[37:56.500 --> 38:01.220]  under the National ID card implemented by the TSA that will be on the streets of
[38:01.220 --> 38:04.500]  America I told you that 10 years before they were on the streets they're going
[38:04.500 --> 38:08.100]  to be everywhere you're about people having to get you know TSA approval for
[38:08.100 --> 38:13.540]  a motorcycle license in Florida or to get jobs it's going to be every job
[38:13.540 --> 38:19.100]  that's their plan they're phasing it in worldwide similar systems and if you
[38:19.100 --> 38:23.300]  don't quote pay all the income taxes no judge or jury you can't travel on an
[38:23.300 --> 38:25.980]  airplane you can't leave your state they're going to build internal check
[38:25.980 --> 38:32.140]  points you won't be able to have a job you'll get there and you'll say but Jim
[38:32.140 --> 38:35.500]  you got ten illegals working in here well they've been given government you
[38:35.500 --> 38:39.380]  know waivers they don't have to take them they're exempt but but but I've got
[38:39.380 --> 38:43.980]  to take ten shots a year or more yeah we've been told to let you go
[38:43.980 --> 38:48.460]  Homeland Security DHS says that you don't have the proper waivers you're
[38:48.460 --> 38:54.060]  going to get the shot I mean this is the plan you're going to see it happen
[38:54.060 --> 38:59.660]  you're going to see them take DNA at the DMV to get a car you know how I know to
[38:59.660 --> 39:05.820]  my first film 1997 America destroyed by design and I read Bill Clinton's
[39:05.820 --> 39:09.180]  executive order in their protesting and being arrested refusing the thumb
[39:09.180 --> 39:13.980]  print just draw attention to it and then it was Washington DC and a few other
[39:13.980 --> 39:18.780]  cities through state programs that was a district program began giving you a
[39:18.780 --> 39:25.020]  discount if you'd give blood for a DNA database when you get a driver's license
[39:25.020 --> 39:29.500]  these are all just beta test just like Austin four years ago sort of debate a
[39:29.500 --> 39:34.620]  test with thousands of drivers where you put a box in your car that taxes you by
[39:34.620 --> 39:38.340]  the mile and then you get some other discounts and things to be part of the
[39:38.340 --> 39:45.140]  test this is all lined up ready to overnight in the scheme of time more
[39:45.140 --> 39:50.060]  will start happening in a year than has happened in the previous 10 then more
[39:50.060 --> 39:54.380]  will start happening in a month that happened in the previous year more will
[39:54.380 --> 39:58.780]  then start happening in a week that happened in the previous year I mean
[39:58.780 --> 40:05.780]  it's all lined up it's all actuaried battle planned ready and let me tell
[40:05.780 --> 40:10.500]  you it's nightmarish we do not want to go down this road and we have sabotage
[40:10.500 --> 40:15.020]  enemy operations we've slowed them down we've frustrated their programs we have
[40:15.020 --> 40:19.740]  decompartmentalized the military and police to a great extent but I'm here
[40:19.740 --> 40:22.980]  to tell you this is an anti-human movement by the globalists that don't
[40:22.980 --> 40:30.140]  even see themselves as human they see us as homo sapiens sapien and they want
[40:30.140 --> 40:34.460]  to become these super sapiens that merged with machines the sapien just
[40:34.460 --> 40:40.620]  means wise one and that's basically what they call themselves so that's all
[40:40.620 --> 40:44.300]  coming up we'll get into that Buckley brought in some articles I mean here it
[40:44.300 --> 40:50.900]  is from yesterday New York Times Musaoui calls Saudi Prince patrons of al-Qaeda
[40:50.900 --> 40:56.340]  and it gets into al-Qaeda praising the Saudi Arabian princes for helping them
[40:56.340 --> 40:59.980]  prepare with stinger missiles to shoot down Air Force One that's the New York
[40:59.980 --> 41:02.300]  Times
[41:03.140 --> 41:09.580]  ladies and gentlemen the Saudi government runs out ISIS runs al-Qaeda does
[41:09.580 --> 41:12.940]  that mean that sometimes these groups don't attack Saudi Arabia to demand more
[41:12.940 --> 41:18.380]  goodies and more power and more weapons absolutely but that's the real
[41:18.380 --> 41:22.480]  problem there it is the New York Times convicted terrorists claims Saudis
[41:22.480 --> 41:27.020]  funded al-Qaeda and knew a plot to down Air Force One it's in the 28 pages the
[41:27.020 --> 41:31.020]  Saudi Arabia was running the hijackers and they were in Saudi intelligence yeah
[41:31.020 --> 41:36.020]  but let's go further than that under Clinton and Bush they protected those
[41:36.020 --> 41:39.460]  hijackers when the FBI tried to stop them when they were training when people
[41:39.460 --> 41:45.140]  at the flight schools were suspicious but what about how at least five of the
[41:45.140 --> 41:51.940]  19 trained at US military bases and were given spy training the head of the
[41:51.940 --> 41:56.180]  defense language school Colonel Stephen Butler went public a week after 9-11 in
[41:56.180 --> 42:02.340]  the San Jose Mercury news and said I don't know what's going on but we train
[42:02.340 --> 42:07.180]  these guys at our bases Muhammad Atta was in my class something's wrong of
[42:07.180 --> 42:14.100]  course of course do we know exactly what happened no but we know that this
[42:14.100 --> 42:19.300]  was allowed to happen bare minimum there's ABC news still secret 28 pages
[42:19.300 --> 42:22.740]  that could change our understanding 9-11 I've been told by the congressman on
[42:22.740 --> 42:27.220]  this show and military intelligence people on this show that's seen it what
[42:27.220 --> 42:35.380]  it says senator Graham former senator Florida 9-11 Commission has said what
[42:35.380 --> 42:43.420]  said it we know what's in it do I get apologies to thank you up that Fox News
[42:43.420 --> 42:49.420]  Club about the Seahawks and how the deal they lost from so he could work for me
[42:49.420 --> 42:56.340]  just sick jokes basically that equates to Alex Jones lost the Seahawks
[42:56.340 --> 43:01.300]  pardon me what do you just said something in my ear sorry about that we
[43:01.300 --> 43:04.860]  rolled the clip a little early oh that's okay I even know you rolled the clip
[43:04.860 --> 43:08.460]  early it's fine it's live radio live TV
[43:13.220 --> 43:21.940]  now the Pavlovian message that is sent there is Alex Jones lost the Seahawks
[43:21.940 --> 43:28.460]  Super Bowl and they do the same kind of just openly Pavlovian brainwashing where
[43:28.460 --> 43:31.420]  I talked about this yesterday they'll say yeah there's a lot of sexual crime and
[43:31.420 --> 43:34.980]  abuse against women on the internet I'm Bella Riley we need to stop it and they
[43:34.980 --> 43:37.780]  cut to a club of me screaming about something completely different and then
[43:37.780 --> 43:43.740]  have the words hate on my face implying Alex Jones hurts women buddy I didn't
[43:43.740 --> 43:49.140]  settle sexual harassment cases like you and we have the transcripts of the top
[43:49.140 --> 43:56.820]  stuff you say that was recorded so if I was you I'd shut your fat mouth how dare
[43:56.820 --> 44:05.500]  you accuse me of what you do punk with no proof I'm gonna throw up here in a
[44:05.500 --> 44:10.100]  minute let's go ahead and go to that clip where Alex Jones basically caused
[44:10.100 --> 44:13.700]  the guy to lose the Super Bowl here it is which is exactly what a truth or does
[44:13.700 --> 44:18.340]  a truth or sees the obvious before you see the planes hitting the building but
[44:18.340 --> 44:22.020]  he chose the more complicated idea because it appears edgier and it would
[44:22.020 --> 44:26.140]  appear daring and brave if you're actually right but if the truthers are
[44:26.140 --> 44:29.260]  right they would be heroes but they're wrong so they're fools you know you're
[44:29.260 --> 44:33.540]  gonna get this assessment of this game anybody I didn't know he was gonna go
[44:33.540 --> 44:40.580]  truth or to be honest and then in the full clip they attacked me it's the clip
[44:40.580 --> 44:44.320]  we played yesterday we've had some computer problems as I mentioned to you
[44:44.320 --> 44:47.220]  yesterday where a lot of these clips are getting messed up we're gonna get to the
[44:47.220 --> 44:51.580]  bottom of this and start having those clips for folks again working in order to
[44:51.580 --> 44:56.220]  lose his job so we can go work for Alex Jones that's my theory but but there's
[44:56.220 --> 45:01.140]  actually there's actually some truth truth to this what what Carol did was
[45:01.140 --> 45:06.180]  he thought himself out of the right call mm-hmm there was an expected and
[45:06.180 --> 45:11.820]  obvious play that he had to make and he chose the more complicated one yeah so
[45:11.820 --> 45:16.300]  first we started the clip too late and then we started it kind of in the middle
[45:16.300 --> 45:19.300]  so let's just back it up we're gonna get this right let's just back it up about
[45:19.300 --> 45:22.060]  20 seconds before you started it right there we're gonna play from there just
[45:22.060 --> 45:25.800]  whenever you're ready stand this for a second Greg you have a theory on the
[45:25.800 --> 45:30.660]  end yeah okay when you see a play that was so just deliberately self-destructive
[45:30.660 --> 45:35.740]  the only thing you could conclude is that it was an inside job and after all
[45:35.740 --> 45:40.420]  the coach coach Pete Carroll is a 9-11 truther he believes the government had
[45:40.420 --> 45:44.060]  something to do with that with that with what happened that ended up in the
[45:44.060 --> 45:48.660]  deaths of what almost 3,000 people so I believe that this is an inside job I'm
[45:48.660 --> 45:53.260]  what but now I have to wonder why did Pete Carroll throw the game and it's in
[45:53.260 --> 45:57.900]  order to lose his job so we can go work for Alex Jones that's my theory but but
[45:57.900 --> 46:01.540]  there's actually something there's actually some truth truth to this what
[46:01.540 --> 46:07.060]  how what Carol did was he thought himself out of the right call mm-hmm there
[46:07.060 --> 46:11.420]  was an expected and obvious play that he had to make and he chose the more
[46:11.420 --> 46:15.540]  complicated one which is exactly what a truther does a truth or that's enough
[46:15.540 --> 46:20.820]  so there you get the basic garbage I mean this is just over the top out of
[46:20.820 --> 46:24.780]  control I want to get to that news that I was just mentioning the force
[46:24.780 --> 46:30.500]  inoculations I want to get more into the Taiwan crash I want to get more into

[47:56.420 --> 47:59.940]  main reason I started taking it a few years ago when he developed his formula
[47:59.940 --> 48:03.380]  for us even before it was out sort of taking it you know to work out better
[48:03.380 --> 48:06.820]  to help me have more stamina so I could exercise more lose weight people see how

[48:15.100 --> 48:18.900]  ago but it just wasn't really pulling the pounds off of me and it's been a
[48:18.900 --> 48:22.660]  journey but super male vitality super female vitality is pretty much the same
[48:22.660 --> 48:26.660]  formula it's just got a few things added to it that supercharged women a
[48:26.660 --> 48:33.380]  little bit more than the other ingredients believe me I had for about the
[48:33.380 --> 48:36.340]  first year took a half dose of this because it was just too much now I'm
[48:36.340 --> 48:40.460]  up to a full recommended dose and quite frankly some days I go over that talk to
[48:40.460 --> 48:45.220]  your physician before you take this this is not a game this is not a joke this
[48:45.220 --> 48:51.060]  is hardcore comparable formulas are about twice this and usually they're just a
[48:51.060 --> 48:54.820]  few of the ingredients this is a whole bunch of powerful known cold pressed
[48:54.820 --> 49:01.260]  organic concentrated and we have a super male vitality fight for humanity
[49:01.260 --> 49:04.620]  special to win the human race the globalists are trying to suppress us on
[49:04.620 --> 49:09.500]  so many levels it's important to turbo charge our bodies your body's under
[49:09.500 --> 49:13.580]  hormonal attack from the estrogen mimicers in the food to your water and

[49:17.580 --> 49:21.420]  biology now it's time to get your body in balance and fight back I've tried
[49:21.420 --> 49:25.620]  working out and eating right but I still felt out of wax sometimes years ago I
[49:25.620 --> 49:30.940]  started taking the experimental form of what you now know as info wars life
[49:30.940 --> 49:36.060]  super male vitality formula and I felt the difference you've heard and read the
[49:36.060 --> 49:40.120]  amazing results and heard callers consistently calling into my show
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.060]  talking about the amazing benefits super male and super female vitality and
[49:44.060 --> 49:48.940]  you've seen the changes for yourself as I've just accelerated my use of it now
[49:48.940 --> 49:52.180]  is time for you experience for male vitality or super female vitality for
[49:52.180 --> 49:57.540]  yourself fight for humanity special when the human race specials when I'm
[49:57.540 --> 50:00.900]  calling it I guess Buckley right in the supper Anthony calls it fight for
[50:00.900 --> 50:04.780]  humanity special I think it's when the human race special super males for
[50:04.780 --> 50:11.860]  female vitality both 20% off through February only while supplies last when
[50:11.860 --> 50:22.060]  the human race and again when we say while supplies last this formulation of
[50:22.060 --> 50:27.300]  super male super female it's basically going to be the same but one of the
[50:27.300 --> 50:33.060]  ingredients we just cannot find totally organic and it's so rare we've pretty
[50:33.060 --> 50:36.980]  much exhausted it I mean that's really happening so we're going to replace it
[50:36.980 --> 50:40.300]  with two other things that we can get that are organic shows me a little bit
[50:40.300 --> 50:44.500]  different formula group thinks it's going to be better whatever the point is
[50:44.500 --> 50:48.860]  we've got a limited supply of the original super male super female when
[50:48.860 --> 50:53.180]  that's gone it'll be a new formulation so if you want it like a vintage wine or
[50:53.180 --> 50:56.460]  something I'm stockpiling the old one case I'd like it you know better than

[54:03.860 --> 54:17.180]  Alex Jones here back live I wonder if MSNBC CNN Fox is all these pundits that
[54:17.180 --> 54:22.340]  attack me for exposing the fact that we were lied to about exactly what happened
[54:22.340 --> 54:28.620]  in 9-11 how do they feel as it comes out that Saudi Arabia was involved our
[54:28.620 --> 54:34.460]  government knew and bare minimum stood down I mean I've had congressman like
[54:34.460 --> 54:41.100]  Walter Jones on to say yes he's seen the pages that's what it says Senator Graham
[54:41.100 --> 54:47.540]  said the same thing I mean you can attack me all day long but did you really
[54:47.540 --> 54:54.020]  want to be part of covering the stuff up because when it all comes out we're
[54:54.020 --> 54:58.340]  going to remind everybody about the people that fought to demonize anyone
[54:58.340 --> 55:02.740]  that questioned us they're desperate they're scared and they should be because
[55:02.740 --> 55:07.980]  it's going to come out and by the way traders the military knows 9-11 was
[55:07.980 --> 55:11.460]  impossible the way they said it happened so when you demonize me for being a
[55:11.460 --> 55:18.940]  truther I appreciate that because the people that know how explosives work the
[55:18.940 --> 55:25.620]  people that know about al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia they agree with me you're not
[55:25.620 --> 55:29.260]  up on the mountain like Michelle Obama telling kids what to eat in school
[55:29.260 --> 55:35.860]  telling us what to do gutless what's the name of the pundit on the 5 I mean you
[55:35.860 --> 55:40.860]  know it's all a big joke isn't it no it's not a joke that our government stood
[55:40.860 --> 55:47.620]  down and let's Saudi Arabia carry out 9-11 bare minimum don't you get it you
[55:47.620 --> 55:51.380]  make fun of some football coach it's got the courage to point that out you're a
[55:51.380 --> 55:57.580]  coward and here's the rest of the story they're coming with forced inoculations
[55:57.580 --> 56:03.180]  they're coming with forced shots in this country that's what they're pushing is
[56:03.180 --> 56:08.780]  that the kind of nation we want to live under and the vaccine companies big
[56:08.780 --> 56:16.540]  pharma is pressing every year to get 30 40 50 new vaccines approved and they've
[56:16.540 --> 56:20.140]  had vaccines from the diarrhea vaccine that killed a bunch of babies they had
[56:20.140 --> 56:24.580]  to pull that I mean sometimes it kills so many people they got to pull it they
[56:24.580 --> 56:28.260]  pulled Gardasil all over the world not here I mean because Americans will take
[56:28.260 --> 56:32.700]  this stuff roll over and die and nobody gets in trouble I mean it's pathetic
[56:32.700 --> 56:38.540]  what we put up with so I want to ask the listeners a question right now and by
[56:38.540 --> 56:41.860]  the way we don't screen your calls unless I say it's on a particular topic
[56:41.860 --> 56:45.260]  and that's not really screening them screening them's where you find people
[56:45.260 --> 56:48.780]  that you basically agree with what they're saying I want to put them on we
[56:48.780 --> 56:53.500]  have open phones for people that disagree with me on this vaccine issue nurses
[56:53.500 --> 56:57.260]  doctors whoever most nurses and doctors agree with us I'm gonna open the phones
[56:57.260 --> 57:01.220]  up I'd like to hear from you a are you gonna go along with forced inoculations
[57:01.220 --> 57:07.100]  will you leave California in other states they try to pass these laws what
[57:07.100 --> 57:10.420]  do you make of this big push what do you make of the fact that even New York
[57:10.420 --> 57:14.500]  Daily News admits the 2011 measles outbreak in New York was caused by the
[57:14.500 --> 57:18.700]  vaccine I mean will you at least give me that that the insert says it can give it
[57:18.700 --> 57:24.060]  to you but Megan Kelly and and Obama say there's zero side effects it'll
[57:24.060 --> 57:27.460]  hundred percent protect you don't listen to conspiracy theorist don't listen to
[57:27.460 --> 57:33.820]  the insert that comes with it I want to hear from you are you gonna go along
[57:33.820 --> 57:36.980]  with forced inoculations or how are we gonna fight this because here's the
[57:36.980 --> 57:41.060]  deal they're already in the Associated Press and this is the move saying you're
[57:41.060 --> 57:44.420]  not gonna get a driver's license you're not gonna be able to get a job if you
[57:44.420 --> 57:47.780]  don't take the vaccine I mean this is Nazi Germany this is how this is how
[57:47.780 --> 57:52.140]  this stuff starts folks this is why ID cards are dangerous now the illegals
[57:52.140 --> 57:56.380]  they get everything free so this is gonna sleep on the street the illegals
[57:56.380 --> 58:01.020]  get to be above the law I mean this is a scientific takeover and you can have a
[58:01.020 --> 58:05.780]  cute tart like Megan Kelly up there you know telling everybody how great this is
[58:05.780 --> 58:11.940]  it's not Megan okay and the blood's on your hands now all these kids I bet you
[58:11.940 --> 58:16.420]  bottom dollar she has kids she doesn't give them this stuff nobody with a half
[58:16.420 --> 58:21.180]  a brain does it I wish there were safe vaccines out there there aren't 800 to
[58:21.180 --> 58:30.220]  5 of 9 9231 1 800 to 5 of 9 9231 we're gonna talk about the coming of the
[58:30.220 --> 58:35.060]  forced inoculation that no other country does that is martial law as Rand Paul
[58:35.060 --> 58:43.580]  called it he's now being demonized for saying thank you for listening to GCN
[58:43.580 --> 58:52.460]  visit GCN live calm today what disaster is so powerful it unleashes a chain of
[58:52.460 --> 58:57.620]  mass pandemics economic meltdowns and violent food riots all at the same time
[58:57.620 --> 59:02.220]  NASA has already set the countdown timer and right now the 21st century
[59:02.220 --> 59:07.420]  apocalypse is less than 13 months away former CIA director James Woolsey says
[59:07.420 --> 59:12.020]  two-thirds of US population could perish in a matter of seconds the world as we

[01:03:24.380 --> 01:03:28.700]  i want to show people the german studies and dr. eisenstein died a few
[01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:33.300]  weeks ago he did studies up and he treated a bunch of amish up in illinois
[01:03:33.300 --> 01:03:38.220]  in another state the amish don't have autism the amish have a fraction of the
[01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:41.940]  birth defects and they've tracked it back to back scenes as being one of the
[01:03:41.940 --> 01:03:49.220]  major issues so they have major german government studies where three four
[01:03:49.220 --> 01:03:53.740]  times the asthma the allergies three four times the autism i mean it's just
[01:03:53.740 --> 01:03:57.060]  we've got all the graphs i want to show them to you because it's gonna be in the

[01:08:15.060 --> 01:08:19.100]  with us here in Austin Texas we played the clip yesterday and he said it's the
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:27.180]  beginning of medical martial law to have forced inoculations well they're
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:31.140]  introducing bills in California and other states for forced inoculations now
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.780]  understand they've got hundreds of vaccines on the market hundreds more
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.140]  about to come on the market these companies lobby states and the federal
[01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:43.060]  health departments to push these on the public and lie and say it's the law they
[01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:48.860]  then have liability protection there the carnage is massive they get up on
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:52.660]  television and in the newspaper every year before school starts in august and
[01:08:52.660 --> 01:08:57.380]  say it's the law to take vaccines that's not true then they go it's safe and
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:02.020]  effective no side effects maybe a sore arm these are the standard PR things or
[01:09:02.020 --> 01:09:07.140]  all that anti-vaccine news got discredited in England no facts no
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:11.260]  nothing it's not true they just announced that it's been discredited like
[01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.180]  Obama announces it's discredited that there are death panels in the health
[01:09:15.180 --> 01:09:18.820]  bill really here's the subsections it's discredited against ready your doctor

[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:50.100]  discredited AP three years ago in thousands of newspapers we had calls
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:53.780]  stations calling us you better defend this why you're in quite a controversy
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:57.980]  there's no plan to use drones to surveil us citizens we had all the government
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:02.020]  documents defense department local newspapers the Homeland Security using
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:08.500]  it to arrest ranchers wired magazine like Jones you better Jones you said the
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:12.940]  sun came up this morning they said it didn't you better prove it the things
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:20.300]  up in the sky okay so they play these these confidence games with people
[01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:24.580]  everybody knows there's 20 years ago when I was talking about vaccines they'd
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:29.940]  go there's no mercury in those where's it say mercury we go off the Marisol's the
[01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:35.340]  name of it oh you mean that mercury it's not bad for you and then okay okay well
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:40.020]  we took it out we took it out no they didn't they've made lots available that
[01:10:40.020 --> 01:10:44.020]  are very hard to get that don't have it and that's what rich people take and I
[01:10:44.020 --> 01:10:48.340]  have the London Guardian and I have the article I'm gonna get to it showing that
[01:10:48.340 --> 01:10:53.340]  I'm not just making these claims the rich people wouldn't take these vaccines
[01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:57.060]  if their life depended on it if there's some deadly thing out there that they're
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.500]  worried about they're about to go to third world country they'll do a cost
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.700]  benefit analysis and decide yes I'm gonna take a vaccine but I'm gonna find
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:07.660]  the very best and they have special doctors they go to and Rob do is actually
[01:11:07.660 --> 01:11:11.500]  pulling those articles out right now I just drug him and David died in here
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.020]  because they all get excited hearing me cover this and get upset about the
[01:11:15.020 --> 01:11:18.500]  system lying they run in with articles they run in with inserts they run in
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.620]  with documents and I said hey just come in here and talk about it the news
[01:11:21.620 --> 01:11:25.620]  director and one of our news anchors David Knight I'm gonna go to Brenda
[01:11:25.620 --> 01:11:31.260]  Mike Rick Jeff Alex and others here in just a few minutes again we open the
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.260]  phones up have you had a bad reaction a good reaction do you believe in
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:37.340]  vaccines do you disagree with vaccines what do you think a force in
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:42.740]  oscillation nobody else in the world does this except for India and others
[01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:46.100]  and they've been caught sterilizing women with the shots they've caught them
[01:11:46.100 --> 01:11:50.460]  in Africa doing it the villagers in Africa run now from the UN trucks I
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:55.340]  mean they know what's going on all the Christian relief groups have gone in
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:58.620]  and they interview the Indian and African women they go I was pregnant and
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:02.460]  they give me shots and I lose baby and all the seven other women given shot
[01:12:02.460 --> 01:12:07.820]  all those baby they kill us we run towards me I mean this is going on you
[01:12:07.820 --> 01:12:13.260]  understand and the UN admits they had a female hormone to the tetanus shot that
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:17.660]  then causes an autoimmune response to that hormone that's been in the times
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:22.900]  of India in the BBC I mean do you understand folks they're adding stuff
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:27.540]  just like they have Trojan garbage in the cell phones and the smart meters
[01:12:27.540 --> 01:12:31.100]  remember I told you 15 years ago that the smart houses were coming and
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:35.140]  everything was spy on you and integrate and hook into data over power lines and
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:39.380]  light bulbs and I had the documents from MIT and it was so funny and everybody
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:44.220]  made fun of me and said I was nuts no I was crazed to warn you and try to stop
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:50.060]  this okay so I wish they had clean good vaccines there's still side effects to
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:54.380]  it it's still lowers normal immunity but I would give my kids vaccines for
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:59.460]  tetanus and other major issues if my uncle wasn't in the hospital for weeks
[01:12:59.460 --> 01:13:02.420]  and almost died from a tetanus shot when he was 30 something years old and I was
[01:13:02.420 --> 01:13:06.220]  a little kid if my mom didn't almost die from a flu shot she was so healthy
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.060]  took her first flu shot almost killed her years ago when she was running
[01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:13.260]  triathlon like 20 years ago it's so it's not that we're not seeing an
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:17.260]  oculation doesn't work I go to an allergy clinic folks and get shot up with
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:22.340]  stuff that I'm allergic to and it's helping that's immunity I take vaccines
[01:13:22.340 --> 01:13:30.500]  on a weekly basis I know it's real you cannot but but see I'm there I watch
[01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:35.460]  them this is locally made with the 14 things I'm allergic to they mix it
[01:13:35.460 --> 01:13:39.820]  together they inject the serum I gotta have an epipen in case I have a big
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:46.100]  reaction I'm building my immunity and I'm getting a lot better Austin's the
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:49.500]  capital of allergies so get it straight they want to act like we're a bunch of
[01:13:49.500 --> 01:13:54.180]  cavemen that are against science and technology and against the wonderful
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.940]  vaccines that have no side effects as they lie to you and say there aren't
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:03.180]  side effects senator Paul said two days ago you shouldn't give babies hepatitis
[01:14:03.180 --> 01:14:07.580]  shots he's a medical doctor there's no reason it's a very dangerous shot it's
[01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:11.620]  very risky shot it's it says on the insert it's very dangerous until six
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:15.540]  years ago they wouldn't give pregnant women vaccines because they knew it
[01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:20.500]  caused all this so we're gonna after we take calls from Brenda and Alex and
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:25.980]  Jeff and Rick and Mike and others 800 2599231 coming up the next segment one
[01:14:25.980 --> 01:14:29.980]  right to your calls to have your point ready to go the next person we're gonna
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:35.500]  go over the German studies look at this government study new study vaccinated
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:39.900]  children have two to five times more diseases and disorders than unvaccinated
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:44.180]  children we're gonna go over all this how the elite don't take the stuff we
[01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:49.900]  take on on on this is social control this is eugenics this is what John P.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:53.460]  Holdren writes about in eco science the White House science are this is on
[01:14:53.460 --> 01:15:00.060]  record but I was talking to Rob do and then David had another angle about well
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.620]  who he thinks this whistleblower is that that they're gonna allow to testify he
[01:15:03.620 --> 01:15:07.420]  thinks it's a whitewash and I agree with him but I wanted to bring up what do
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:12.660]  say because as he said he got an email with the insert from Merck that we
[01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:17.540]  showed yesterday saying it it isn't linked to diabetes or pancreatitis saying
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:20.940]  that it didn't say that on the paper when we showed close-ups of it for TV
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:25.860]  viewers you can go online to their website and read it Rob how outrageous is
[01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.500]  this that people are in that level of denial it's ridiculous and the guy
[01:15:29.500 --> 01:15:33.100]  didn't put his email in or I would have responded to him he or she whoever they
[01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:38.180]  were I want to be politically correct it's almost 2016 but I mean it says it
[01:15:38.180 --> 01:15:41.940]  right there pancreatitis it says it in black and white right there where you
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:44.460]  can read it and that's just one of the many things it also says in three
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:47.700]  different spots it causes measles there's three different types atypical
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.900]  measles it gives you a measles like rash which is measles I mean look right here
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:52.940]  corner of the back page
[01:15:52.940 --> 01:16:00.020]  endocrine system and it says diabetes pancreatitis diarrhea vomiting I mean it
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:04.380]  goes on it says can cause it it says can give you measles like rash over here
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:08.220]  yeah atypical muscles on the front side yeah zoom in right here guys it's just
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:13.700]  right here it says pancreatitis yeah boom and that you know that's destroying
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:16.780]  your pancreas and then it doesn't work right and then it causes a whole health
[01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.780]  a whole host of other issues that they're not looking at but anaphylaxis
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.940]  that's like a shock that you get your system it'll shock your system there's
[01:16:24.940 --> 01:16:28.460]  all that's when the kids convulse right exactly and there's measles like rash
[01:16:28.460 --> 01:16:32.780]  right there and I don't know where it says measles I think it has flip it over
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:36.900]  on the front in the corner right there yeah yeah you guys can just point the
[01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:39.100]  camera one spot I'll put the paper there doing a great job
[01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:42.460]  yeah atypical measles I mean it says it in three different spots that it causes
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:46.380]  measles and and people wonder why people that are vaccinated are coming down
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:50.380]  with it well they're the ones spreading it it says you can spread measles and
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:54.820]  don't be around people for 60 days after you take it and this is the mmR it
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:16:58.780]  also contains one for mumps and rubella and it's the live virus for all three of
[01:16:58.780 --> 01:17:02.540]  those that they're injecting into you at the same time and nobody thinks this is
[01:17:02.540 --> 01:17:07.300]  gonna cause and then they just have Obama and all the people get up on TV and
[01:17:07.300 --> 01:17:10.740]  say there's no side access proven safe and we got the sheet and then the
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:15.620]  listeners won't even believe this yep I gotta I can't do anything Alex I got a
[01:17:15.620 --> 01:17:18.300]  call from a guardian reporter yesterday and he's like what do you say about hood
[01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:21.980]  immunity and you're about to get into this we've never done a study about herd
[01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:25.940]  immunity made up in the United States we've never done sat down and and
[01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:29.540]  compared unvaccinated and vaccinated children but Germans did Germans did
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:33.420]  Germans did yeah Germans did New Zealanders have done it what what's so great
[01:17:33.420 --> 01:17:36.180]  about them why can they do it and we can't it's a herd mentality it's not a
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:39.220]  herd immunity there you go and if you want to talk about the guardian guardian
[01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:42.660]  does some good stuff but they're off the charts and some other things they they
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:47.020]  really did a hit piece with this measles outbreak in California the headline is
[01:17:47.020 --> 01:17:51.700]  unvaccinated woman spreads measles and if you read the article they don't know
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:55.780]  who patient zero is and they say that we don't know who actually started it
[01:17:55.780 --> 01:18:00.140]  they're lying but there were seven people they got sick at the hotel and and look
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.860]  one of these was an unvaccinated woman and so they follow her I mean they're
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:07.700]  demonizing this and the thing that I can't understand Alex is the absolute
[01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:12.260]  vitriol and hatred especially from the left people like Slate magazine saying
[01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:17.700]  we need to criminally charge and sue the people who are doing this how about if
[01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:21.500]  you criminally charge and sue the pharmaceutical companies who promise that
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.420]  this stuff is 99% effective and it isn't I've got a story that I'm working on
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.780]  right now measles Mary and the outbreak they don't want to talk about and it's
[01:18:29.780 --> 01:18:34.820]  CDC numbers and it's a small outbreak that happened in 2011 I want to talk
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:39.820]  about that that really breaks down these numbers as to as to what the vaccine
[01:18:39.820 --> 01:18:46.420]  really failed to do in New York in 2011 and and you look at the revolving door
[01:18:46.420 --> 01:18:50.980]  between you know government and big business especially big pharma the head
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:57.220]  of Merck vaccine unit worked for the CDC how can you have this my kids have
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:19:00.780]  never had it and they all got it at different times had a few little red
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:04.620]  spots on them yeah and and we're in bed for a day I got the months and I got
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:08.300]  the mom's vaccine and they go well you should have had my grandmother had the
[01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:13.100]  booster one month after she took the polio vaccine got the strain yeah they
[01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:16.220]  gave it to her well now there's a mystery illness going around that is a

[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.540]  inoculations will you fight these attempted state laws and federal
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:23.220]  regulations trying to order people to take shots will you let them blame us
[01:24:23.220 --> 01:24:28.940]  for the measles outbreak that's been clearly caused by the vaccines it's a
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:33.060]  joke you've got a revolving door a big pharma running the federal regulatory
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:38.700]  agencies and paying off the media with massive advertising and it is totally
[01:24:38.700 --> 01:24:43.500]  sick and they're setting a precedent to put whatever they want in us and they've
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:48.940]  been coming out for a decade with social engineering vaccines that have live
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:54.820]  viruses that actually destroy key receptors in the brain to make you
[01:24:54.820 --> 01:25:00.100]  servile and docile now I first reported on this when no one else knew about it
[01:25:00.100 --> 01:25:06.820]  it's now in mainstream news and they're quote testing it on PTSD troops a lot
[01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:09.940]  of them that end up getting the shots end up committing suicide because they're
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:14.740]  not people anymore and they're testing it on the troops the same ones that are
[01:25:14.740 --> 01:25:19.540]  on government death panels the secret death list oh the government loves you
[01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:23.460]  so much please take your shots that we put the troops on list not be given
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:30.300]  health care these are monsters monsters all right Brenda and then we'll go to
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:35.220]  Jeff Rick Blake Alex and others Brenda your vaccine story or your take on
[01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:44.260]  vaccines hello yes ma'am go ahead well I'm Brenda from Idaho and
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:53.500]  I want to alert everybody to the real reason why they want you to make
[01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:59.980]  this mandatory is these deletes want to do away with billions of people in the
[01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:05.460]  first place and they want to give us binary weapons systems in us so that
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:08.420]  they can release something else that binds with it later and wipes us out
[01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:12.780]  that is a big part of them trying to force inoculations on us is to force
[01:26:12.780 --> 01:26:17.700]  that precedent to then use a binary extermination mode that will make them
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:23.220]  completely safe when they release the other agent exactly and the thing of it
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:30.860]  is I when I got my I had polio there was I was born in California and there was
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:36.940]  a big outbreak of who can cough well I was just born so I shouldn't even know
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:45.340]  in the hospital and so anyway I got this shot it's right on my birth
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:54.780]  certificate I looked and I come down with polio polio molitis it was a light
[01:26:54.780 --> 01:26:59.700]  case because at that point in time I really believe that they were running
[01:26:59.700 --> 01:27:05.100]  out of polio serum so they gave a lot of kids and babies and stuff like that
[01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:13.380]  polio to build up their their serums and later on when those that don't know
[01:27:13.380 --> 01:27:16.740]  they wanted to get your blood and breathe more of it yeah most people I
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:19.700]  know they got polio got it from the shot and that's just another big open
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:24.660]  secret but you're supposed to give a baby a polio vaccine that they have a huge
[01:27:24.660 --> 01:27:28.060]  immunity when they're first born to begin with it's just outrageous we've
[01:27:28.060 --> 01:27:32.540]  turned our babies into lab rats with a government known for a huge history of
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:38.340]  secret experimentation I mean how crazy is that exactly that's exactly what
[01:27:38.340 --> 01:27:43.780]  they're doing and they're counting on the stupidity of the American people now
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:47.540]  we've been in the dark for a long time I haven't I've been awake real awake
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:56.340]  since Reagan at that ooh anyhow I and they that's when they started
[01:27:56.340 --> 01:28:02.380]  experimenting with nanobots and when I turned 52 I was good and healthy in
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:09.180]  everything you know but I do have a almost an inch limp in my leg and
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:14.740]  everything like that but I was good and healthy up until about 52 and then it
[01:28:14.740 --> 01:28:22.020]  started coming back on me my polio and anyway I started having these bumps
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:26.500]  coming all over my right side or I mean my left side but you know what was in

[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:17.860]  girls I have a special message for you from the president of the United States
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:22.340]  I salute the boys and girls who are buying United States saving stamps and
[01:34:22.340 --> 01:34:26.540]  bonds and they're giving important support to the cause of freedom and the
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:32.300]  men who fight for us in Vietnam Congress gave us this authority in
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:43.660]  August 1964 that's pretty far reaching that's the sky is the limit as an
[01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:46.900]  American citizen you have to respect our president whether I like it or not it's
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:51.100]  really not not my decision but I do respect my president and I will support
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:35:09.580]  whatever decision he makes it is a hard fact that u.s. strikes have resulted in
[01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:27.500]  civilian casualties he didn't even say goodbye he didn't take the time to lie
[01:35:27.500 --> 01:35:33.340]  the United States knows that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction well the
[01:35:33.340 --> 01:35:37.300]  first things they told me was you're not even to acknowledge the drone program
[01:35:37.300 --> 01:35:44.260]  you're not even to discuss that exists renewed hostile actions against United
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:51.580]  States ships on the high seas and the Gulf of pumpkin have today required me to
[01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:57.860]  order the military forces of the United States to take action and reply that
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:36:05.660]  reply is crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones on the
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:11.380]  GCN radio network that's right all right I want to go to your calls that last
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:15.060]  caller we spent about five minutes with incredible story first call her out of
[01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:20.380]  the gates got polio after she was vaccinated for polio at birth my
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:27.780]  grandmother just growing up it was yeah I got polio from the polio vaccine just
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:34.020]  boom the doctors admitted that but now 64,000 just a few years ago was in the
[01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:39.940]  Indian newspapers children got paralyzed after the vaccine program sponsored by
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:46.700]  Billa Melinda Gates and they said yes they're paralyzed it's like polio well
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:53.020]  it is polio the insert for MMR says it gives you the measles you can spread it
[01:36:53.020 --> 01:36:59.060]  for 60 days can give you diabetes I mean we wonder why diabetes is off the
[01:36:59.060 --> 01:37:04.580]  chart it's a lot of things with vaccines are part of it it causes an
[01:37:04.580 --> 01:37:10.060]  autoimmune response in the pancreas folks it fries it and I get why people are
[01:37:10.060 --> 01:37:13.100]  emailing saying it can't be true it can't be true that's not a real insert
[01:37:13.100 --> 01:37:18.300]  because you don't want to admit what they've done to you a lot of you all I'm
[01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:22.660]  doing here warning you I mean it's so frustrating that we should be able to
[01:37:22.660 --> 01:37:27.140]  stop this and defeat this and again I mentioned that vaccine that they gave
[01:37:27.140 --> 01:37:32.660]  kids Senator Paul talked about it that was posing in a cure diarrhea and then
[01:37:32.660 --> 01:37:37.260]  it would cause blockages in the children and kill them they had to pull it off the
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:41.980]  market we're the only country where most of stuff doesn't get pulled they usually
[01:37:41.980 --> 01:37:44.940]  make a new vaccine and then a five years later or ten years later or a year
[01:37:44.940 --> 01:37:47.420]  later they got to pull it off the market in other countries because people go
[01:37:47.420 --> 01:37:51.940]  whoa this is killing people not here they just keep selling it and selling it
[01:37:51.940 --> 01:37:56.100]  I mean when you give somebody a vaccine so they don't quote get earaches or get
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:38:00.460]  diarrhea or quote get depressed what do you think biologically that's doing the
[01:38:00.460 --> 01:38:07.500]  body reprogramming it we are the genetically modified organisms now we
[01:38:07.500 --> 01:38:12.100]  are like Petrie dish amoebas being manipulated or lab rats and it's not
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:18.900]  funny let's go to Rick in Florida Rick you're on the air welcome good afternoon
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:23.180]  Alex answering your question heck no I'm not taking any of their forced
[01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:27.620]  inoculations it's an ignorant it's an appalling violation of our fourth
[01:38:27.620 --> 01:38:33.820]  amendment it's unconstitutional okay why don't you tell your listeners about the
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:38.620]  femorisol and the squalene that's in there I know and they'll just say
[01:38:38.620 --> 01:38:43.060]  there's no mercury in it when I've been at Walgreens and in shot videos arguing
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.500]  with them and they go there's no mercury and I go what's the Marisol they go oh
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:51.860]  that's that's a preservative and it's the name of mercury I have a related
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:56.860]  question to ask you I saw something on the internet about 30,000 guillotines
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:03.020]  being purchased by FEMA what do you know about this it's a urban legend rumor
[01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:07.340]  there were some guillotines brought in out of Iraq after the first Gulf War and
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:11.580]  that's where some of those rumors started I appreciate your call I've been
[01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:15.780]  getting that question for 20 years about once a week but it's it's good to ask
[01:39:15.780 --> 01:39:20.780]  questions but that that's his best I know let's go ahead the real guillotine
[01:39:20.780 --> 01:39:25.460]  of these vaccines and the GMO and there's new studies out about GMO corn
[01:39:25.460 --> 01:39:30.460]  killing pigs I mean this isn't a game folks Jeff in Michigan you're on the
[01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:36.940]  ear hey Alex I am a health journalist I want to go by three quick points that
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:40.860]  people might not know about these vaccines so because the reason it says
[01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:45.060]  there there have been no controlled studies is because we are the controlled
[01:39:45.060 --> 01:39:49.060]  studies right now that's why we're the final stage of research is the public
[01:39:49.060 --> 01:39:53.020]  that's why well that's I'm absolutely right in fact the CDC admits that the
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:57.940]  year before they did the H1N1 thing five years ago they released the virus as
[01:39:57.940 --> 01:40:02.780]  a stimulant in the last vaccine so they're doing tests they admit inside
[01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:08.100]  the vaccine so you're absolutely right we are the mass test that's why the
[01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:11.820]  talking point in the mainstream media they always say well it's got to be
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:15.660]  healthy because there's been over a million doses given because they don't
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:20.820]  know and also the the other point is the they go by the germ theory it's
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:24.580]  actually the law of the terrain by Antoine Bochamp he's the person that
[01:40:24.580 --> 01:40:28.980]  they forget about and that is the argument for herd mentality that's why
[01:40:28.980 --> 01:40:33.500]  it basically says biological terrain of your body is what keeps you healthy not
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:37.180]  immunity does not come from a needle that's why doctor groups products when
[01:40:37.180 --> 01:40:41.620]  you detoxify your body you are changing the biological terrain from toxic to
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:45.580]  non-toxic and what that's doing is allowing you to have a greater immunity
[01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:48.940]  that's what the none of these mainstream people are talking about is how to
[01:40:48.940 --> 01:40:54.940]  individually get your immunity up they just want to push the needle well
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:41:01.380]  absolutely and look they're piggybacking on real science that's been going on
[01:41:01.380 --> 01:41:06.540]  for over 500 years with this learned immunity with this artificial immunity
[01:41:06.540 --> 01:41:11.340]  no one's debating that that's not a real science it's just that they deny any
[01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:15.780]  side effects they deny any problems and then now they're using it as a social
[01:41:15.780 --> 01:41:19.980]  engineering tool and escalating it into hundreds of shots and the carnage is
[01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:23.940]  clear and they're doubling down going we're gonna vaccinate pregnant women
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:27.300]  we're gonna increase the vaccines yeah this year's flu shot doesn't work so
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:32.220]  get another one it's just a pure wall of arrogance and then now they want to
[01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:38.460]  bully everyone into you cause people to get sick and to create a new divide and
[01:41:38.460 --> 01:41:43.460]  conquer feminist against men black against white white against black
[01:41:43.460 --> 01:41:48.500]  Hispanic against this northern against south this football team is that
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:55.340]  football team divide divide divide divide divide while the globalists are
[01:41:55.340 --> 01:41:59.580]  literally screwing us seven ways to Sunday thank you for the call Jeff Alex
[01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:07.220]  in Wisconsin you're on the air hi can you hear me yes sir yes I'm here from
[01:42:07.220 --> 01:42:18.020]  Wisconsin I was born in the 80s and I got my standard round well kid a beauty
[01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:26.620]  shot and pretty much right away I started having epileptic fever seizures that's
[01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:31.740]  in the inserts yeah and my parents didn't know what was going on and pretty
[01:42:31.740 --> 01:42:36.060]  much when I turned five and around that age I made sure not to get any other
[01:42:36.060 --> 01:42:41.600]  shot and it continues for like a long time having problems with that and still
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.580]  to this day I have that type of issue I also had like educational issues I was
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:51.780]  in I'd like a pretty heavy speech impediment and absolutely your brain
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:56.300]  had an autoimmune response look it says in all the vaccine inserts can cause
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:01.740]  epileptic seizure epileptic shock can cause all sorts of inflammation on the
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:07.980]  brain neurological disorders neon beret and when you when you take the shot if
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:13.060]  you don't have a convulsion in the facility and and you have it the next
[01:43:13.060 --> 01:43:16.300]  day and ambulance comes they'll they don't ask did you just have a shot even
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:22.540]  though everybody knows the big elephant in the room is that so mr. Brown you've
[01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:25.900]  never had a history of epileptic seizure and you've never had this in your
[01:43:25.900 --> 01:43:30.340]  family well we're gonna do a CAT scan to see if you have a brain tumor now that's
[01:43:30.340 --> 01:43:33.260]  on the outside that you were having you know these sudden seizures as a brain
[01:43:33.260 --> 01:43:37.940]  tumor but they don't care they're gonna milk some cash out of you now because
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:42.780]  they're never gonna say something that the medical cult put out did this but
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:46.900]  I'm really sad to hear that happen to you I know a bunch of people that have
[01:43:46.900 --> 01:43:51.060]  lost their jobs and are on disability because their feet and hands are numb
[01:43:51.060 --> 01:43:56.700]  now and they can't do their jobs and that's just part of America you take
[01:43:56.700 --> 01:44:02.100]  your shot and if you're lucky your hands and feet just get paralyzed or numb you
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.420]  know for other folks they're end up on a respirator and you know in a hellish
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:10.220]  facility and bankrupting their whole family but that's what we do to take the
[01:44:10.220 --> 01:44:14.540]  shot to prove we love government and we sacrifice ourselves on the altar of the
[01:44:14.540 --> 01:44:18.060]  loving government we will continue no matter how many children die no matter
[01:44:18.060 --> 01:44:22.260]  how many people have convulsions no matter how many birth defects we love our
[01:44:22.260 --> 01:44:27.740]  loving government and we love doing what they say appreciate your call Blake in
[01:44:27.740 --> 01:44:34.140]  Maryland Blake you're on the year well hi darling how are you I'm being a little
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:40.380]  cynical and sarcastic here it's very very sad to see this full push and my
[01:44:40.380 --> 01:44:44.300]  husband is jealous of you because you do a better Marvin Martian than he does oh
[01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:53.380]  dear we'll inoculate these pesky earth creatures there now you're not too smart
[01:44:53.380 --> 01:44:59.660]  are you now my takeover plan will be successful that's right hey listen you
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:06.420]  just you pushed my button today the forced inoculation scares the heck out
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:19.980]  of me I got the swine flu shot I think it was 2000 2009 when I got that and four
[01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:25.420]  to six months later I started having all kinds of medical problems just been
[01:45:25.420 --> 01:45:32.420]  healthy as can be all my life just healthy and ever since then I mean it was
[01:45:32.420 --> 01:45:41.820]  just there like it just all of a sudden I had problems with my heart I had immunity
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:47.180]  issues are just ridiculous well that's what the insert says it can do to you
[01:45:47.180 --> 01:45:52.180]  but you know safe and effective Obama said so Megan Kelly said so are you
[01:45:52.180 --> 01:45:57.660]  saying that Megan Kelly the little puppy dog little bows in her hair are you
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:46:03.340]  saying sweets he's lying yeah boxes is starting to become a lot worse than
[01:46:03.340 --> 01:46:11.260]  CNN and MSNBC I mean it's just it's just also fake but I tell you what this
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:17.580]  needs to be an issue people rise up over I I mean it's just it's destroyed my
[01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:25.220]  life I mean as far as my physical being it's destroyed me well you look at the
[01:46:25.220 --> 01:46:29.380]  medical numbers on vets that haven't even been in heavy combat and and they
[01:46:29.380 --> 01:46:33.940]  are just the cancer the kidney failure the skin problems the immunity problems
[01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:39.140]  they get shot after shot hundreds and hundreds of vaccines in just a few years
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:43.340]  and sometimes they'll give them a shot and say oh we lost the record shots again
[01:46:43.340 --> 01:46:47.700]  I know folks that have been given the same shot five times in a row and then
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:53.540]  meanwhile the the brass do not take it I mean Joe Biggs used to be ordered to go
[01:46:53.540 --> 01:46:56.860]  get everybody vaccinated as a staff sergeant he'd say hey you guys aren't
[01:46:56.860 --> 01:47:00.180]  taking it he's told me the stories and they go shut up big get out there and
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:04.340]  get it done and so they don't take it in fact I have the articles right here I'll
[01:47:04.340 --> 01:47:10.060]  show it after the break mainstream news where in the German military the brass
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:13.820]  quote take a safe vaccine and so does the government and I have articles in
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:21.580]  China and the US they do not take it what does that tell you people on the fence
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:27.100]  need to investigate this on their own and I tell you what if I had to do all
[01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:31.860]  over again no way would I have ever taken my children and had so many
[01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:37.860]  poisons pumped into them one after the other after the other and you know all
[01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:42.660]  I can do now is just tell everybody I can what happened to me and
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:51.660]  refer them to articles on your site on other sites that I you know these things are poison I they're they're just
[01:47:51.660 --> 01:47:57.660]  poison that's it and it's done for a purpose guys it's for a purpose and it's
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:03.940]  not to eradicate these diseases it's done to give you all sorts of man-made
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:09.420]  illnesses anthropogenic illnesses so they can medicalize you that again the
[01:48:09.420 --> 01:48:12.620]  doctors and nurses are compartmentalized most of them aren't aware of it but
[01:48:12.620 --> 01:48:15.820]  top doctors like Blalock and others have gone out and read the establishment
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:20.380]  literature where it's all admitted going back to the 50s this plan to soft kill
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:27.180]  to weaken to inject people with cancer viruses that they had basically developed
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:34.460]  and selected that that that are triggered when hormone levels decrease and
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:38.820]  and other things I mean this is tailored murder and you know they kill you 30
[01:48:38.820 --> 01:48:42.900]  years later you don't even know what killed you that's called a soft kill
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:46.340]  and I've been talking about that for 20 years up but they had a movie a few years
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:49.820]  ago with Brad Pitt called killing you softly where the people don't even know
[01:48:49.820 --> 01:48:52.820]  he's gonna kill him he just he just kills them when they're not paying
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:57.140]  attention and that's what it is they kill you softly appreciate your call sorry
[01:48:57.140 --> 01:49:02.100]  to hear about that we're gonna come back and talk to Thomas and many others
[01:49:02.100 --> 01:49:07.540]  that are patiently holding 800 259 92 31 we'll continue right into the next hour

[01:56:53.020 --> 01:56:57.660]  over this for yourselves but that's from the German report from the German
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:57:01.660]  government's own breakdown I mean this is stuff people might want to go look at
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:06.780]  you mean you might want to find out about this I mean the Amish don't take
[01:57:06.780 --> 01:57:10.500]  any of these and all across the country autism is just unknown disorder

[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:56.900]  alex how are you doing sir all right brother hey I've got two questions I
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:01:00.140]  really want to ask you but I do want to touch on the topic of the vaccines is
[02:01:00.140 --> 02:01:04.460]  yesterday you mentioned about Meg and Kelly so last night I tuned in to watch
[02:01:04.460 --> 02:01:07.140]  and see what her reaction was that they're still talking about the topic in
[02:01:07.140 --> 02:01:12.460]  a word it was absolutely disgusting they were totally ride the train of the
[02:01:12.460 --> 02:01:17.580]  new world order yep gotta have the government they have the power to put
[02:01:17.580 --> 02:01:21.380]  things in us when this government's been caught doing everything evil you can
[02:01:21.380 --> 02:01:26.540]  imagine just I mean who would buy into that well a lot of people obviously I'm
[02:01:26.540 --> 02:01:30.860]  in a position in life to know but you know so a lot of people are believing in
[02:01:30.860 --> 02:01:35.300]  the new world system that's that's just there's no debate about that there's no
[02:01:35.300 --> 02:01:37.980]  doubt about that but I got another question or two questions I like to
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:42.340]  ask Alex on this show here you mentioned earlier who you briefed on 9-11
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:45.460]  let me ask you this right this is something I've been pondering my head
[02:01:45.460 --> 02:01:49.820]  for a long time I've got investigative experience in my life it doesn't take a
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:54.420]  genius once you take the blinders off to figure it was an inside job right
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:02:00.260]  well certainly a stand-down certainly a stand-down yes at the least like I say
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:04.380]  I don't know the details and you know most people don't we have theories but
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:09.380]  the bottom line is what happens when it comes out and I'm assuming it will that
[02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:12.700]  it will come out that the US was involved does that mean there's more
[02:02:12.700 --> 02:02:16.460]  credence given to Muslims maybe they get more seats in Congress or something or
[02:02:16.460 --> 02:02:21.060]  because because they were allied with radical Islamists that would carry out
[02:02:21.060 --> 02:02:24.660]  something like that if they could and Saudi Arabia certainly was involved I
[02:02:24.660 --> 02:02:28.180]  mean ISIS is a real group just our government's helping arm them there I
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:32.460]  mean look at how they just continually turn these people loose except on 9-11
[02:02:32.460 --> 02:02:36.860]  it's beyond giving stinger missiles to Al Qaeda's they can shoot down aircraft
[02:02:36.860 --> 02:02:44.060]  you know in the free Syrian army this is norad standing down the hijackers
[02:02:44.060 --> 02:02:50.340]  trained at US bases building seven getting blown up I mean it it looks like
[02:02:50.340 --> 02:02:55.340]  beyond just letting them attack it looks like certain criminal elements of
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:59.420]  intelligence agencies we're working with other intelligence agencies that's
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:05.060]  for everything points feasible and and your expertise obviously because you've
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:09.620]  been in this for a long time that they they say they they the new order leaves
[02:03:09.620 --> 02:03:14.140]  out the hang chainie rice bush and whoever else was involved it says they
[02:03:14.140 --> 02:03:19.940]  were involved they they wrongfully blamed the Muslims and the Muslims get
[02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:25.260]  credence at that point that they've been used to do nefarious things and you
[02:03:25.260 --> 02:03:28.540]  understand what I'm going with this oh yeah no certainly that that could be a
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:32.620]  narrative right now it looks like they're gonna blame the Saudi government
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:36.100]  who was ended up to their eyeballs I mean I'm not sure exactly what's gonna
[02:03:36.100 --> 02:03:40.340]  happen but it's very good points thank you Thomas Rachel in PA you're on the
[02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:47.300]  ear welcome hi Alex I had a tetanus shot about six months ago and I've been
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:53.540]  healthy for ten years prior to that and I've had pneumonia since then and I don't

[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:38.380]  the Nobel Prize winner Joseph Sticklets former head of the World Bank called a

[02:09:05.380 --> 02:09:12.860]  and kill for they could buy our daughters and our sons for they're above the law
[02:09:12.860 --> 02:09:21.860]  tax exempt diplomatic immunity the UN they now want to force GMO and
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:27.740]  inoculations on us we're in India and Africa and Pakistan and Libya the people
[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:33.060]  run you if you go back 50-60 years ago the people would run towards Western
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:36.300]  doctors because they knew they were getting good health care the natives
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:41.180]  would do anything now they run
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:51.100]  what's that 80s song once I ran to you now I run from you one of those techno
[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:57.380]  new wave bands I forget it's a good song be some good bumper music and that's it
[02:09:57.380 --> 02:10:01.860]  they run they run for the brush they run for the hills they run for the mountains
[02:10:01.860 --> 02:10:06.820]  they run they run for the desert they run they run and I'm here saying I'm
[02:10:06.820 --> 02:10:10.260]  running from the New World Order the problem is there's nowhere to run they
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:13.740]  say fight or flight is so close to each other because fighting is a form of
[02:10:13.740 --> 02:10:19.380]  flight basically back when I grew up in Dallas and a lot of mean people like to
[02:10:19.380 --> 02:10:22.500]  fight and you know if somebody started to fight with me sort of beat me up I
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:29.100]  didn't run I I fled forward I aggressively would just spaz out and and
[02:10:29.100 --> 02:10:35.900]  just go into it and it wasn't because I was enjoying it I just wouldn't run I
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:41.500]  would run towards it somebody would you know swing a punch and that's why I
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:45.700]  would just start threatening to attack me and I just go at them because it was
[02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:56.340]  just boom oh you're starting to fight bam I stopped that and I'm here just
[02:10:56.340 --> 02:11:02.020]  simply trying to get people to understand we're under attack folks I mean
[02:11:02.020 --> 02:11:06.380]  they're on the news I mean look let's say you're even four vaccines because
[02:11:06.380 --> 02:11:09.460]  there's some arguments that if they're clean and good and something's really
[02:11:09.460 --> 02:11:13.140]  dangerous out there that you know I would take them I'm explaining this
[02:11:13.140 --> 02:11:19.100]  thousands of times thousands over the last 20 years but they get on the news
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:22.100]  and say it's the law to take them and that there's no mercury in them or
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:26.020]  mercury's in it but it's good for you and they get on the news and tell you
[02:11:26.020 --> 02:11:30.500]  there's no side effects they're lying folks why would you trust liars with
[02:11:30.500 --> 02:11:33.660]  anything in fact new listeners probably just tuned in we got new affiliates all
[02:11:33.660 --> 02:11:37.380]  over the country will you queue up CBS news saying mercury containing
[02:11:37.380 --> 02:11:43.220]  vaccines help children's neurological development close quote journal
[02:11:43.220 --> 02:11:51.340]  pediatrics federally funded I mean this is like 10 years old mercury is good
[02:11:51.340 --> 02:11:55.660]  for you as the name of the clip on YouTube I mean mercury's not good for
[02:11:55.660 --> 02:12:00.620]  your brain 2 plus 2 equals 4 not 5 raising the debt limit does raise the
[02:12:00.620 --> 02:12:04.980]  debt limit everything is not awesome everything is not wonderful there's a
[02:12:04.980 --> 02:12:09.340]  lot of awesome wonderful things out there that I want to protect the genetic
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:16.420]  code of the planet our children our women instead they've got this background
[02:12:16.420 --> 02:12:21.020]  of happy lovey trendiness that everything's fine but it's all skin deep
[02:12:21.020 --> 02:12:28.660]  behind it is scientific evil here is CBS news is a certain nationwide this is
[02:12:28.660 --> 02:12:33.980]  an Austin local version of it where they tell you that mercury is good for your
[02:12:33.980 --> 02:12:38.420]  brain go ahead mercury containing vaccines may help not harm kids according
[02:12:38.420 --> 02:12:42.420]  to two new studies in the journal pediatrics there have been widespread
[02:12:42.420 --> 02:12:45.780]  concerns that mercury based preservatives and vaccines might impair
[02:12:45.780 --> 02:12:49.820]  the neurological development of children these new studies suggest that the
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:53.260]  opposite that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved
[02:12:53.260 --> 02:12:57.620]  behavior and mental performance so they've got whistleblowers coming out
[02:12:57.620 --> 02:13:01.820]  from the CDC from mark you name it saying yeah we covered up that these are
[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:06.380]  linked autism you've got all over the world countries banning all these
[02:13:06.380 --> 02:13:12.860]  vaccines from Japan to India you've got the science coming out you've got
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:17.900]  major scientific labs in Africa you've got Catholic bishops coming out against
[02:13:17.900 --> 02:13:24.340]  it saying they're adding steroids to it I mean they're in trouble they're in
[02:13:24.340 --> 02:13:30.100]  trouble so there's a quadrupling down right now saying that if you don't get
[02:13:30.100 --> 02:13:32.780]  vaccinated you're gonna kill everybody and now California and other states have
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:38.580]  introduced legislation today that CBS news to forcibly inoculate your children
[02:13:38.580 --> 02:13:43.300]  they passed the law three years ago in California where the age of consent is
[02:13:43.300 --> 02:13:50.340]  now 11 for your child to decide to be vaccinated without your consent now let
[02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.620]  me explain something and everybody knows this but let me just in case people
[02:13:52.620 --> 02:13:58.180]  don't you can't it's statutory rape if you convince a 16 year old girl when
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:14:01.980]  you're 20 to have sex with you because they're saying she she isn't of the age
[02:14:01.980 --> 02:14:06.620]  to make that decision you took advantage of her now you can argue if you're 18
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:10.500]  your girlfriend 16 I mean is it really statutory rape probably not but it's
[02:14:10.500 --> 02:14:14.220]  got a high standards people don't want their kids getting messed with you're
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:19.660]  11 years old you better believe you're not of the age of consent for sex for
[02:14:19.660 --> 02:14:23.980]  people giving you drugs or alcohol that's why if you get caught you know
[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:27.860]  using drugs when you're 12 you don't get in trouble the first few times because
[02:14:27.860 --> 02:14:30.940]  you weren't of the age of consent you couldn't make decisions you're
[02:14:30.940 --> 02:14:36.420]  incompetent basically and I I think that's true I think an 11 year old is
[02:14:36.420 --> 02:14:40.820]  incompetent to make an abortion decision is incompetent to make a vaccine
[02:14:40.820 --> 02:14:45.380]  decision is incompetent to say should I take this LSD I've been given that's why
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:51.540]  drug dealers target them predators target the youth because an 11 year old
[02:14:51.540 --> 02:14:56.500]  girl can't make a decision about being sexually promiscuous about STDs or any
[02:14:56.500 --> 02:15:04.140]  of it so here's the state like a big fat pervert involved saying our children
[02:15:04.140 --> 02:15:07.780]  belong to them and then of the kid and they give a little discount credit cards
[02:15:07.780 --> 02:15:13.060]  and Walkman's little little you know mp3 prizes when you agree to get the shot
[02:15:13.060 --> 02:15:18.700]  do you want a free mp3 and $100 on a gift card everybody who says so sign
[02:15:18.700 --> 02:15:24.580]  this form you get to get the vaccine tomorrow almost all the kids do it I
[02:15:24.580 --> 02:15:32.140]  mean how creepy is that I mean come on folks this is beyond 1984 all right I'm
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:37.300]  gonna go to Walt and Catherine and Mary and Ken and Mark and everybody else
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:43.660]  Walt in Michigan you're on the air go ahead well Alex you and I've been
[02:15:43.660 --> 02:15:48.180]  talking on and off ever since you've been on a radio and I wanted to share some
[02:15:48.180 --> 02:15:54.180]  information I got a while back it kind of shook me and personally know
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:16:00.900]  two things I talked Edward has them on the phone directly to his house who wrote
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:06.540]  the book Dr. Mary Smoky well he knows a lady by the name of Judith Staker who
[02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:09.780]  was a girlfriend of Lee Harvey Oz yeah we well we've had both of them on the
[02:16:09.780 --> 02:16:15.220]  show well let me tell you what I know personally I know a guy named Richard
[02:16:15.220 --> 02:16:19.280]  Hull H-U-B-V-L-E was a maintenance while they're General
[02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:24.620]  Moore truck and bus in Pontiac, Michigan I know for 20-30 years in one day
[02:16:24.620 --> 02:16:29.460]  Alton the alleyway were by herself of course he told me that he knew Lee
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:33.740]  Harvey Oswald has served in the same Marine Corps platoon with him and talked
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:38.780]  to Lee Harvey Oswald today he left the Marine Corps to go to the Central
[02:16:38.780 --> 02:16:45.420]  Intelligence Agency he was no traitor Lee Harvey Oswald had nothing to do with
[02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:49.380]  John F. Kennedy's murder of course he was set up like McVeigh and was going to
[02:16:49.380 --> 02:16:52.460]  blow the whistle and we've confirmed that with federal documents McVeigh said
[02:16:52.460 --> 02:16:57.180]  I'm not going to blow up of daycare we were supposed to sting this and get the
[02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:00.740]  white supremacist in here out of Elohim we cooked the bomb but we're not
[02:17:00.740 --> 02:17:06.300]  supposed to detonate it so they set McVeigh up and then they it's the same
[02:17:06.300 --> 02:17:10.860]  thing it's been partially declassified that he was in that secret Marine base
[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:16.740]  in in in what was it Okinawa with the spy planes he was allowed to come back
[02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:21.580]  in he lived with white Russians in his file part of it's been declassified that
[02:17:21.580 --> 02:17:27.260]  he was assigned to the CIA and FBI so what your friend told you from first-hand
[02:17:27.260 --> 02:17:34.260]  account was true he was set up just like Tim McVeigh there's more a Richard
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:39.260]  Hubble guess what he died of a fast-acting cancer just like you'll
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:44.940]  check Ruby and guess what they were weaponizing down in New Orleans at
[02:17:44.940 --> 02:17:49.780]  that anniversary that that book breaks down was weaponized cancer viruses to
[02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:56.740]  kill world leaders along with the polio vaccine also the same thing I got
[02:17:56.740 --> 02:18:02.020]  polio I have got it coming back in my legs now as an adult an old lady that
[02:18:02.020 --> 02:18:08.260]  lives ten miles from me who's above the same age as I am her polio is coming
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:13.020]  back in her legs and I can tell you one thing I know what activates the cancer
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:18.100]  in one out of every 200 people that had the polio vaccine with the fast-acting
[02:18:18.100 --> 02:18:23.580]  cancer virus attached to it is radiation how much of they are encouraged
[02:18:23.580 --> 02:18:29.180]  people to have x-rays you know MRIs and all the other and it's been proven in
[02:18:29.180 --> 02:18:35.580]  major studies guys Google this that that that x-rays and MRIs trigger cancer
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:40.980]  viruses to activate in the viral plaques that are attached to cells you know your
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:46.180]  stuff buddy you've done some research and more that I'll tell you something else
[02:18:46.180 --> 02:18:51.780]  this idea of reducing population goes back a long ways I think there was a
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:55.700]  guy in England or Europe I can't remember the guy's name but I read the
[02:18:55.700 --> 02:18:59.060]  article about it in his statement we've got to do something about there's too

[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:49.380]  that's right we should do a flashback on Henry Kissinger's report to the

[02:24:40.540 --> 02:24:46.180]  the vaccines now they run
[02:24:46.180 --> 02:24:51.180]  matter where they are black white doesn't matter asian they run because they
[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:53.460]  know
[02:24:54.660 --> 02:24:58.620]  because the globalist went too far in certain world areas they would give
[02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:02.540]  people hard kill stuff that would kill people in a few weeks kill their babies
[02:25:02.540 --> 02:25:10.220]  or paralyze them so folks know they run see the real militaries out there the
[02:25:10.220 --> 02:25:14.300]  real death camps of these big hospitals and the real militaries out there are
[02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:19.940]  the white Red Cross vehicles from the UN now you get a lot of good aid workers
[02:25:19.940 --> 02:25:24.020]  a lot of good doctors a lot of good nurses who work in the system and they
[02:25:24.020 --> 02:25:27.340]  fix your leg when it's broken they can help you with this or that they'll
[02:25:27.340 --> 02:25:30.740]  even treat the tumors that were you know that you got from the polio vaccine
[02:25:30.740 --> 02:25:37.900]  that's on record I say on record I mean it really is on record and the system
[02:25:37.900 --> 02:25:43.580]  just hopes you don't look into all this once I ran to you now I run away from
[02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:48.980]  you mark in New Jersey powerful callers today so many people calling in who got
[02:25:48.980 --> 02:25:53.780]  the polio from the polio vaccine I mean my grandmother was told by her doctor
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:59.460]  she got it from it and people were so you know pro-america for world war two
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:02.420]  to be like well it's just a mistake nothing's perfect in the fight against
[02:26:02.420 --> 02:26:06.340]  this but you look at the numbers it was spreading it just like it is today just
[02:26:06.340 --> 02:26:11.380]  like the measles just like the insert says I mean how do you get around that
[02:26:11.380 --> 02:26:18.940]  Megan Kelly Barack Obama go ahead Mark you're on the air yes sir thank you you
[02:26:18.940 --> 02:26:26.860]  inspire me to be brave I'm 55 years old and in 2000 I went to Rutgers
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:33.740]  University to get a college degree and I was a year into it and they told me that
[02:26:33.740 --> 02:26:39.700]  I had to have an MMR measles mumps rubella shot otherwise I could not
[02:26:39.700 --> 02:26:45.500]  receive the grades that I paid for and earned I went to a doctor they gave me a
[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:52.300]  teeter test to see if I had antibodies and I had no antibodies and the price
[02:26:52.300 --> 02:26:58.420]  for the test was $700 and the insurance did not cover it they gave me my first
[02:26:58.420 --> 02:27:05.700]  MMR injection I took the note from the doctor to Rutgers and they said no you
[02:27:05.700 --> 02:27:11.220]  have to have two injections and I told the nurse well you know now I got to pay
[02:27:11.220 --> 02:27:14.140]  for it again she says by the way that's not even wanted to say you're not
[02:27:14.140 --> 02:27:16.960]  supposed to take the quote booster for I think six months depends on the vaccine
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:20.620]  but see this just shows this new thing where they go take two flu shots this
[02:27:20.620 --> 02:27:24.740]  year we don't know why I just do it it's all part of the doubling down all part
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:30.580]  of an arrogance go ahead so what happened so I told the nurse put the poison in my
[02:27:30.580 --> 02:27:35.980]  arm I want my grades and she says well you're you're 41 years old you might
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:38.620]  want to have children I don't want to give you the shot if you're gonna have
[02:27:38.620 --> 02:27:43.580]  children now I says no I'm not gonna have any children put it my arm wait a
[02:27:43.580 --> 02:27:49.660]  minute so even the nurse knew how deadly this stuff is yes sir Wow so she gave me
[02:27:49.660 --> 02:27:59.220]  the shot and I graduated in 2003 and a couple years later I start having numb
[02:27:59.220 --> 02:28:06.500]  legs oh yeah and shooting pains yeah went from like pins and needles and now
[02:28:06.500 --> 02:28:10.900]  it's to the point that it feels like electric screwdrivers huh going into my
[02:28:10.900 --> 02:28:16.300]  legs and hands and have you been diagnosed with Guillain beret no sir I
[02:28:16.300 --> 02:28:21.900]  have been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy and there is no cure for that
[02:28:21.900 --> 02:28:30.260]  and the drugs they give you are gabapentin and or Lyrica and they give
[02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:35.580]  you now you know that they've got a whole whole whole whole classes of
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:39.860]  neurological disorders that vaccines are causing but that's basically in the
[02:28:39.860 --> 02:28:46.300]  Guillain beret family that's terrible sir and and and the gabapentin with the
[02:28:46.300 --> 02:28:52.020]  suicidal thoughts wasn't helping me enough so my doctor said what we'll do
[02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:57.180]  is we'll give you a catalyst drug to boost it Tom and he put me on some
[02:28:57.180 --> 02:29:05.020]  balta which is Prozac's cheap generic cousin and the Prozac is a hideous drug
[02:29:05.020 --> 02:29:09.660]  that was tearing out part of my brain by the way let me just add something you
[02:29:09.660 --> 02:29:15.420]  know what you say from your doctor's true you know that that Prozac is a
[02:29:15.420 --> 02:29:21.300]  fluoride molecule that's been altered and it is an adjuvant fluoride is an
[02:29:21.300 --> 02:29:25.260]  adjuvant or an accelerant it boosts other drugs so you're right that's why
[02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:29.100]  they add the fluoride to the water is to boost the other trace drugs that are
[02:29:29.100 --> 02:29:34.100]  being put into the other food chain I'm sorry to hear this happen to you sir and
[02:29:34.100 --> 02:29:37.900]  and you're saying you believe it's directly connected to the vaccine
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:42.980]  they have no way of knowing and they're willing to do a lot of expensive and
[02:29:42.980 --> 02:29:48.460]  painful tests on me and there's no cure for it anyway well that's the story is

[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:41.660]  Canadian government at one time the British born Jeremy Wright could
[02:33:41.660 --> 02:33:44.580]  remember his name and only hung out with him through four days when I was
[02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:48.900]  covering Bilderberg in 2006 he died a few years after that but he's the one that
[02:33:48.900 --> 02:33:58.340]  coined the answer to 1984 is 1776 and 1776 worldwide and it just I think it's
[02:33:58.340 --> 02:34:01.860]  interesting that slogan is very popular all over the world now as attributed to
[02:34:01.860 --> 02:34:08.060]  me online because I gave a speech out there and you know threw that in you
[02:34:08.060 --> 02:34:12.740]  know at the Bilderberg group in that famous speech so it's the answer in
[02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:17.540]  1974 1776 and the guys were able to fair it out by watching the film his name I
[02:34:17.540 --> 02:34:21.380]  just forget it was only met him a few times had dinner with him a few times
[02:34:21.380 --> 02:34:28.020]  he and I and Jim Tucker who's also dead I was just pointing out that little idea
[02:34:28.020 --> 02:34:33.980]  he had and continues on all these years later after he's dead and that's how
[02:34:33.980 --> 02:34:37.980]  we're all like little rocks and a pond with those ripples basically going
[02:34:37.980 --> 02:34:42.020]  forever to use that cliche you know a lot of cliches or cliches because they're
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:45.540]  true but we use them a lot because they're so true like the more things
[02:34:45.540 --> 02:34:50.620]  change the more they stay the same best of times worst of times
[02:34:50.620 --> 02:34:55.340]  truth is strange with infection oh it sure is man I just sit back and think
[02:34:55.340 --> 02:35:04.820]  about my life it is so crazy like I hanging out last week with Chuck Norris
[02:35:04.820 --> 02:35:08.900]  the son there's a big accomplished TV and movie director in his own right Mike
[02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:14.260]  Norris who's learned about a motorcycle from Steve McQueen that's who got Chuck
[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:20.380]  Norris into acting and I can't get into the movie yet before it comes out but I
[02:35:20.380 --> 02:35:27.220]  want to show TV viewers a few photos that they sent us here is Gary Haven and
[02:35:27.220 --> 02:35:32.020]  one of the actors you guys go to a document cam shot that's a photo shot
[02:35:32.020 --> 02:35:36.700]  off one of the big cameras there I am with Mike Norris really great guy he's
[02:35:36.700 --> 02:35:41.860]  gonna come down to be in studio soon he lives up by Dallas and there I am at the
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:46.900]  courthouse where they shot this senator scene where I play the evil senator so
[02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:51.060]  that movie supposed to come out in the fall or winter I'm not allowed to talk
[02:35:51.060 --> 02:35:57.260]  about it yet but it's anti-New World Order to say the least and just to I mean
[02:35:57.260 --> 02:35:59.900]  I've had Chuck Norris on the show five six times over the years he told me he
[02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:02.700]  was a listener and liked the show but then talking to his son and you know
[02:36:02.700 --> 02:36:06.500]  don't know how much a listener Chuck is we're getting back on it's just really
[02:36:06.500 --> 02:36:10.460]  weird to know that almost everybody I end up running into from Hollywood is a
[02:36:10.460 --> 02:36:14.340]  listener and I don't mean a listener once a week or something I mean I mean
[02:36:14.340 --> 02:36:18.540]  listen a lot want to say hi to Mike Norris who says he listens every night
[02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:25.580]  but and Gary Haven the you know the billionaire founder of curves is a big
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:29.060]  listener can't wait to get him in studio and the stuff he was telling me about
[02:36:29.060 --> 02:36:35.980]  behind the scenes talking to senators and governors and people all the amazing
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:39.660]  things that he's been learning and I've got separate separate sources I was
[02:36:39.660 --> 02:36:42.700]  there talking to the sheriff and other people just in that county where they
[02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:48.260]  were shooting us people are so awake I was only up there one day last week was
[02:36:48.260 --> 02:36:51.660]  it Monday I took off David Knight did a great job to go do that I didn't take
[02:36:51.660 --> 02:36:57.060]  off I left at 6 a.m. and got back at 12 30 at night that way I could see my kids
[02:36:57.060 --> 02:37:01.380]  in the morning but took off the radio to go do that and it's just every
[02:37:01.380 --> 02:37:08.780]  experience I have it was like 2006 we had a 9-11 truth conference in LA 2000
[02:37:08.780 --> 02:37:15.700]  people showed up international media showed up C-SPAN showed up and I got
[02:37:15.700 --> 02:37:22.340]  invited out by one retired LAPD detective that was running security then
[02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:26.740]  I met a bunch of other LAPD detectives or current LAPD and the next time I went
[02:37:26.740 --> 02:37:30.020]  out there I went out to dinner with a bunch of these guys and I mean they all
[02:37:30.020 --> 02:37:33.820]  were as well-spoken or smarter than I was and knew about everything I mean they
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:38.740]  could they could do a radio show tomorrow as good as this one and that's
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:44.100]  what I'm saying these people are just everywhere who know what's going on I
[02:37:44.100 --> 02:37:48.900]  mean it's like we've won folks is what I'm saying we've won the hearts and minds
[02:37:48.900 --> 02:37:55.340]  not that we even want it people know bull is going on and that's why they
[02:37:55.340 --> 02:37:59.500]  want to divide the vaccinating against the unvaccinated that's why black
[02:37:59.500 --> 02:38:02.900]  against white or citizen against cop it doesn't mean there aren't bad things
[02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:06.940]  happening on all sides it just means it's being pushed and fanned and
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:12.540]  expanded because the globalists need that or they're gonna lose and I know
[02:38:12.540 --> 02:38:16.340]  that's very simple what I'm saying but that's what we've got to really think
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:23.580]  about every day myself included they want us at each other's
[02:38:23.580 --> 02:38:28.700]  throats for a reason because if we ever get together in fact we should come into
[02:38:28.700 --> 02:38:32.780]  the next segment with the bugs life clip if those ants stand up you know then
[02:38:32.780 --> 02:38:37.860]  they might all stand up those puny ants out numbers a hundred to one well the
[02:38:37.860 --> 02:38:40.740]  globalists know we're gonna stand up so they want to stand up against the local
[02:38:40.740 --> 02:38:46.420]  constabulary and crush it so the feds can come in no we're going to crush the
[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:51.860]  new world order like bail off crush Grendel by just grabbing the arm
[02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:58.220]  leveraging and around a column and ripping it out we're just gonna grab and
[02:38:58.220 --> 02:39:04.660]  hold on that's who wins whoever perseveres and just have the will to
[02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:07.580]  just keep telling the truth never stop they're never gonna tell you we're
[02:39:07.580 --> 02:39:10.460]  winning there's gonna tell you we're losing no one's listening oh my gosh
[02:39:10.460 --> 02:39:13.940]  everyone wants to be vaccinated everyone wants world government everyone
[02:39:13.940 --> 02:39:17.620]  wants the state to take over kids everyone wants blah blah blah everybody
[02:39:17.620 --> 02:39:21.220]  wants obama care everybody wants to turn their guns in everybody no they
[02:39:21.220 --> 02:39:25.940]  don't and we have to just discredit the establishment media discredit the
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:30.220]  people that have hijacked our government's state local federal but then
[02:39:30.220 --> 02:39:35.060]  support those in the system that are doing the right thing because if we ever
[02:39:35.060 --> 02:39:39.580]  give aid and financial support and word of mouth support to people in there
[02:39:39.580 --> 02:39:42.660]  that are fighting for freedom who are scared who are getting threatened who
[02:39:42.660 --> 02:39:45.940]  are trying to go as far as they can like Rand Paul and then he's not perfect
[02:39:45.940 --> 02:39:51.900]  people get mad at him well you try being in the arena let me tell you you try
[02:39:51.900 --> 02:39:57.180]  actually being out there on the street you try actually living this stuff and
[02:39:57.180 --> 02:40:05.420]  then you see how hard it is to continue because there's so few people at the top
[02:40:05.420 --> 02:40:08.100]  that'll speak out I think that's what I'm getting it before I go back to calls
[02:40:08.100 --> 02:40:11.460]  here so a lot of times I'll just start speaking extreme of consciousness and
[02:40:11.460 --> 02:40:16.620]  I'm thinking what am I getting it under the surface almost everybody's awake
[02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:20.740]  that matters and by that if you're a movie director you got to be pretty
[02:40:20.740 --> 02:40:25.100]  competent know how the world works if you're a TV producer or a major actor
[02:40:25.100 --> 02:40:28.340]  you got to be pretty competent if you're a cop he's been on the beat a while you
[02:40:28.340 --> 02:40:33.420]  got to be somewhat confident about the real world combat that same thing a
[02:40:33.420 --> 02:40:37.660]  doctor a lawyer anybody that's got to be competent a school teacher you live in
[02:40:37.660 --> 02:40:42.980]  the real world I don't care who you are if you're working in the real world as
[02:40:42.980 --> 02:40:45.980]  an accountant or whatever you're gonna have smarts about how the world really
[02:40:45.980 --> 02:40:50.020]  works in your area that's why they want everybody's playing video games staying
[02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:53.300]  in college till they're 30 never getting out in the real world because that's
[02:40:53.300 --> 02:40:57.220]  just a nation of people and it's about a third of the countries like this now that
[02:40:57.220 --> 02:41:02.060]  doesn't I don't just mean poor people on welfare I mean these trust fund kids
[02:41:02.060 --> 02:41:07.420]  everywhere who just have no idea what's going on in the world and they'll point
[02:41:07.420 --> 02:41:14.740]  at us and laugh all day long the system wants though units like family and like
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:18.700]  communities to fight with each other because if we're busy doing that they
[02:41:18.700 --> 02:41:23.620]  can then rob and rule over us I mean again it's that simple so as negative as
[02:41:23.620 --> 02:41:27.620]  this show is there's a lot of positive stuff every I mean I go to the regular
[02:41:27.620 --> 02:41:31.540]  grocery store now sometimes I'm in a hurry and can't go to an organic place
[02:41:31.540 --> 02:41:36.940]  this pure organic or claims they are Lord knows Whole Foods or Central Market
[02:41:36.940 --> 02:41:46.820]  aren't fully and I mean the cereal aisles no GMO no high fructose corn syrup
[02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:51.900]  blah blah blah I mean that shows you know we've got plastic that doesn't have
[02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:55.940]  bisphenol a a couple years ago they have a small section that wasn't bisphenol
[02:41:55.940 --> 02:42:02.660]  a now you go and target Walmart Randall's I don't care what it is it's
[02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:08.820]  just nothing but bisphenol free and that's because people stood up and said
[02:42:08.820 --> 02:42:12.820]  we don't want to turn our boys into girls and our women into breast cancer
[02:42:12.820 --> 02:42:20.820]  victims I mean I see the changes everywhere we start saying we don't want
[02:42:20.820 --> 02:42:25.140]  smart meters that spy on us and we keep educating folks and we don't want smart
[02:42:25.140 --> 02:42:29.020]  appliances that everybody can hack and take over I would talk about that 10
[02:42:29.020 --> 02:42:32.580]  years ago and people acted like I had three heads now the federal government's
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:37.420]  warning of it and it's the big hot item notice for months we've been getting
[02:42:37.420 --> 02:42:41.380]  into vaccines because I said the big push try to force vaccines is coming I
[02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:45.780]  could see the buildup now we're here notice everybody else is trying to get
[02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:51.140]  on the wave we were already on the wave before it started months ago notice
[02:42:51.140 --> 02:42:54.900]  we're always right over the target with what the big new issue is going to be
[02:42:54.900 --> 02:42:59.500]  because we've got to engage the enemy at point blank range we've got to know
[02:42:59.500 --> 02:43:03.820]  where they're going to strike next to be waiting on I mean just quite frankly
[02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:08.340]  it's unbelievable how accurate in full wars is it's unbelievable how
[02:43:08.340 --> 02:43:15.020]  groundbreaking it is it's unbelievable but it's a testament to 20 years of
[02:43:15.020 --> 02:43:21.100]  focus you you learn how stuff works over 20 years and this whole world's been
[02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:25.820]  designed around distracting and diverting people to keep them compartmentalized to
[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:30.860]  get good people to go join corrupt systems and to go along with it believing
[02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:34.060]  they're doing a good job because the system knows most people are actually
[02:43:34.060 --> 02:43:37.740]  good in the system and so they just need a fake narrative to make them feel like
[02:43:37.740 --> 02:43:42.140]  it's okay but now through decompartmentalization not just this
[02:43:42.140 --> 02:43:47.180]  broadcast but across the board there is a rapid learning curve as people get
[02:43:47.180 --> 02:43:52.780]  what's really going on and then just go whoa the great danger is in going along
[02:43:52.780 --> 02:43:57.900]  with this because this is a human civilization ending road we're on by the
[02:43:57.900 --> 02:44:02.460]  globalist who are they to decide the age of humans is over who are they to decide
[02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:06.100]  the quote evolution of humans and machines who are they to decide what we
[02:44:06.100 --> 02:44:10.580]  put in our bodies who are they to decide what we read or what we do or I mean we
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:17.500]  are not programmable pieces of garbage we're talking about free will here
[02:44:17.500 --> 02:44:23.100]  Monsanto stocks in trouble I mean every globalist operation is is is is is
[02:44:23.100 --> 02:44:26.540]  under fire and let me tell you they are gonna strike back we should be
[02:44:26.540 --> 02:44:32.700]  discussing from the enemy's perspective getting into their mindset wargaming
[02:44:32.700 --> 02:44:37.220]  what they're gonna pull we know what they're gonna pull civil unrest kill
[02:44:37.220 --> 02:44:43.780]  the cops all this other garbage and I'm just I'm telling you we got to stop it
[02:44:43.780 --> 02:44:48.740]  and even if we don't stop the next wave we'll be that much more credible when
[02:44:48.740 --> 02:44:53.700]  the next thing happens and people go wow it just keep exactly again because we
[02:44:53.700 --> 02:44:59.300]  know the enemy operation we've studied them we know them we know what they
[02:44:59.300 --> 02:45:02.620]  stand for and they don't stop doing the same thing because it's been working
[02:45:02.620 --> 02:45:07.740]  but that's a weakness because it doesn't work as well each time if they're
[02:45:07.740 --> 02:45:11.620]  getting closer and closer to failure they're running out of tricks we are
[02:45:11.620 --> 02:45:16.340]  getting closer and closer to their hind end we are on their heels ladies and
[02:45:16.340 --> 02:45:22.340]  gentlemen and they're running now they're gonna pull the stops out but
[02:45:22.340 --> 02:45:27.180]  they've got to know when they set a new cough or release a bio weapon or shoot
[02:45:27.180 --> 02:45:35.500]  up a bunch of schools our people are gonna be everywhere our people are
[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:40.020]  gonna be everywhere and what happens when a cop pulls up at a school and sees a
[02:45:40.020 --> 02:45:43.980]  bunch of anti-terror mercs getting in a truck to drive off and goes in and finds
[02:45:43.980 --> 02:45:48.500]  a dead patsy killed and shoots video of it and releases it and blows up the
[02:45:48.500 --> 02:45:52.500]  false flag within one day not a week not a month see and it's already that's what
[02:45:52.500 --> 02:45:56.100]  happens folks that who what do you think we get all this information we're gonna
[02:45:56.100 --> 02:46:00.340]  blow their operations every time they launch them we got people everywhere and
[02:46:00.340 --> 02:46:05.340]  the great part is there's no cells there's no brain this is not even a cell
[02:46:05.340 --> 02:46:09.740]  operation this is humans wanting justice we're everywhere once we're awake it's
[02:46:09.740 --> 02:46:14.380]  over for you you understand that and just like they say in V for Vendetta when
[02:46:14.380 --> 02:46:17.460]  V's talking to the cops the detectives and he says why didn't you do this
[02:46:17.460 --> 02:46:26.060]  earlier he said I was waiting for you detective I was waiting for you I was
[02:46:26.060 --> 02:46:30.420]  waiting for other men and women who know what's going on to stand up and to do
[02:46:30.420 --> 02:46:34.620]  what has to be done or we're gonna lose everything I mean don't you have a chill
[02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:38.140]  up your back right now do you really want to be in the hands of the New
[02:46:38.140 --> 02:46:42.820]  World Order these are bad people we should all be struggling against this
[02:46:42.820 --> 02:46:47.900]  not because we're we're heroes or have courage it's blind courage to want to be
[02:46:47.900 --> 02:46:53.700]  under this evil I mean you gotta have some courage to go along with this
[02:46:53.700 --> 02:46:57.780]  because let me tell you you're signing on you might as well sign your name in
[02:46:57.780 --> 02:47:02.620]  blood to the devil that's another thing once you know this information and once
[02:47:02.620 --> 02:47:05.540]  you've gone out and checked into it and found out I'm telling you the truth it's
[02:47:05.540 --> 02:47:09.580]  much worse than I say people always go it's worse than you say it's absolutely
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:14.860]  I can't articulate all this once you find this out it's on you to do something
[02:47:14.860 --> 02:47:18.780]  about it people like I don't want to do the work all you got to do is get your
[02:47:18.780 --> 02:47:22.340]  heart right it's like once you decide you don't like something once you decide
[02:47:22.340 --> 02:47:26.720]  you're gonna resist something the doors start opening God just starts opening
[02:47:26.720 --> 02:47:33.140]  doors it's magic for you to do the right thing and every time you face down
[02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:37.460]  evil and every time whether you win or lose it doesn't matter you're being
[02:47:37.460 --> 02:47:44.420]  trained by God to then receive the next level of providence so that you can then
[02:47:44.420 --> 02:47:49.020]  go to that next level fighting evil I'm telling you it's amazing folks this is
[02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:53.380]  the real war for humans future this is the real war for justice the war for
[02:47:53.380 --> 02:47:57.420]  innocence there is an incredible war people want to join and go fight al-Qaeda
[02:47:57.420 --> 02:48:01.100]  heroes who think they're want to you know fight for America who are misguided
[02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:05.820]  manipulated into a full-spectrum dominant system hey the real war is right
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:14.140]  now for your family and the human soul it's going on right now so go talk to the
[02:48:14.140 --> 02:48:17.340]  youth about how they're being targeted go talk to everybody good go to city
[02:48:17.340 --> 02:48:20.820]  council talk call the talk radio get aggressive
[02:48:20.820 --> 02:48:31.620]  Catherine and Alabama go ahead you're on the air hey Alex I'm 33 and I'm a yoga
[02:48:31.620 --> 02:48:40.820]  teacher now I got Hodgkin's disease I believe from a vaccine when I was 18 I
[02:48:40.820 --> 02:48:48.460]  went to public school for the first time and in 11th grade and the school
[02:48:48.460 --> 02:48:55.940]  counselor told me to that I had to get a happy vaccine so I went for the three
[02:48:55.940 --> 02:49:04.060]  rounds and in three months I was I couldn't get out of bed I've lost weight
[02:49:04.060 --> 02:49:09.980]  and I kept going to the family doctor and they would give me a mono test and
[02:49:09.980 --> 02:49:16.340]  metabolic test and say well you don't have mono and they'd send me home three
[02:49:16.340 --> 02:49:22.220]  months after that I had tumors in my lymph nodes and and had Hodgkin's disease
[02:49:22.220 --> 02:49:28.220]  it would be hard to believe that now because people ask me for advice and
[02:49:28.220 --> 02:49:33.380]  I've known people that I've known people that get Hodgkin's lymphoma right where
[02:49:33.380 --> 02:49:36.820]  they get the injection that's very common in fact they admit many inserts
[02:49:36.820 --> 02:49:44.740]  it can give you localized tumors well I got my tumors were in my neck and then
[02:49:44.740 --> 02:49:49.260]  there were two more in my lungs because I was in stage 2a
[02:49:49.260 --> 02:49:57.780]  it's okay now it was definitely a hindrance that I just take it as a
[02:49:57.780 --> 02:50:01.540]  learning curve well God bless you and your courage and we all pray for your
[02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:05.060]  continued recovery and not a recurrence but the media always focuses on the
[02:50:05.060 --> 02:50:09.420]  courage of cancer survivors absolutely but then how to give money to find a
[02:50:09.420 --> 02:50:13.860]  cure how about we find out why cancer is exploding at every level including a
[02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:18.180]  10,000 plus percent on average in children I mean pediatric cancer was
[02:50:18.180 --> 02:50:24.340]  unknown 60 years ago now again I I'm not just saying this to be dramatic
[02:50:24.340 --> 02:50:28.580]  sometimes I'm at the mall or something or I'm at grocery store and I see a kid
[02:50:28.580 --> 02:50:32.380]  with with like a stain on their shirt and I look and they got a little bald
[02:50:32.380 --> 02:50:35.260]  head with a cap on they're holding their mom's hand tell the moms real sad and
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:39.940]  you tell they got a chemo port into their chest and I just got to go and and and
[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:43.020]  and I got to go in the bathroom it doesn't happen a lot I try to just not
[02:50:43.020 --> 02:50:47.860]  look at them and it's a mixture of sadness and rage that I can't stop them
[02:50:47.860 --> 02:50:51.220]  doing this and I mean they're just gonna kill everybody I mean I just I can't
[02:50:51.220 --> 02:50:54.620]  stand it and I have empathy because I have children and it makes me hate the
[02:50:54.620 --> 02:50:59.860]  new world order I hate David Rockefeller I hate Bill Gates I hate Warren Buffett
[02:50:59.860 --> 02:51:03.460]  I hate and I mean people say they're supposed to have hate no the whole
[02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:08.420]  Bibles as passions about God hating evil all I know is I hate the fact that
[02:51:08.420 --> 02:51:14.260]  we're weak and let these sacks of evil do this and yeah I mean just it just I
[02:51:14.260 --> 02:51:17.300]  don't mean to start ranting ma'am I'm sorry anything else I'm so sorry about
[02:51:17.300 --> 02:51:21.940]  your cancer shortly thereafter I had to drop out of high school but shortly
[02:51:21.940 --> 02:51:27.740]  thereafter after I went through treatment I began college and the first
[02:51:27.740 --> 02:51:33.900]  speech that I gave in speech class was on the American Cancer Society who back
[02:51:33.900 --> 02:51:39.860]  then 12 years ago had a nine hundred million dollar budget but they didn't
[02:51:39.860 --> 02:51:47.820]  spend spent almost no money telling people how to prevent these cancers no
[02:51:47.820 --> 02:51:51.900]  the more money we spend on cancer the more cancer I mean can't people put two
[02:51:51.900 --> 02:51:56.540]  and two together the Rockefellers by the 20s had discovered viral cancers it's
[02:51:56.540 --> 02:52:00.540]  in the medical literature the Cold Springs Harbor facility they were
[02:52:00.540 --> 02:52:04.660]  injecting poor Appalachian whites and blacks with it and then they've got it
[02:52:04.660 --> 02:52:08.980]  perfected by the 60s and they just there's murdering us up one side and
[02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:12.180]  down the other they own the biggest group of hospitals in the country that run
[02:52:12.180 --> 02:52:16.540]  the cancer research and it's just all a big joke to them it's all real funny
[02:52:16.540 --> 02:52:25.020]  told me that cancer was a virus and he also told me that only people between
[02:52:25.020 --> 02:52:31.940]  the ages of 18 and 35 were getting Hodgkin's disease so that that has got
[02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:37.620]  to tell people something it's only one segment of the population young people
[02:52:37.620 --> 02:52:44.300]  are getting this cancer not old people not kids but this one sector I mean that
[02:52:44.300 --> 02:52:48.620]  to me that says well something triggered that well I mean I'll see a
[02:52:48.620 --> 02:52:53.180]  beautiful 25-year-old woman on a walker you know down on the Hagenbach trail and
[02:52:53.180 --> 02:52:56.060]  I'll stop and say hey you know what's gonna and they'll be like shocked I'm
[02:52:56.060 --> 02:52:59.340]  talking to them and they'll they'll bring some cameras out and show this and
[02:52:59.340 --> 02:53:03.860]  they'll say yeah I was doing great I was in a you know a runner and I was in the
[02:53:03.860 --> 02:53:08.780]  gymnastics and I had a boyfriend and I go what do you think did it like I took
[02:53:08.780 --> 02:53:13.580]  shots I mean it's just it's just and I just see these victims everywhere the
[02:53:13.580 --> 02:53:17.940]  hardcore operations doing a great job and I see people with their kids on
[02:53:17.940 --> 02:53:21.700]  walkers all over the place I mean we're it's a devastating military operation
[02:53:21.700 --> 02:53:28.500]  and it's just gonna get worse back when I was 18 I just you know I didn't have
[02:53:28.500 --> 02:53:32.700]  access to the information and I just thought well my school counselor is
[02:53:32.700 --> 02:53:38.220]  telling me you have to do this so being conscientious I went for all three
[02:53:38.220 --> 02:53:42.700]  rounds yep they lie to you they lie to you and they say be conscientious you'll
[02:53:42.700 --> 02:53:46.220]  spread this stuff and and that's what they do well God bless you man I'm sorry
[02:53:46.220 --> 02:53:51.500]  I hope you get better I'm glad you've gotten better so far yep so her doctor
[02:53:51.500 --> 02:53:55.940]  told her it was a cancer virus yep you don't really hear that ever on the news
[02:53:55.940 --> 02:54:01.260]  though they don't tell anybody Mary Ann you're on the air from Canada go ahead
[02:54:01.260 --> 02:54:05.620]  thanks for calling hey Alex thanks for having me on I'm a long-time listener
[02:54:05.620 --> 02:54:09.660]  and a huge fan and actually my older daughter will be very upset when she
[02:54:09.660 --> 02:54:15.860]  finds that I'm talking to you because she'd want to talk to you too so I have a
[02:54:15.860 --> 02:54:21.500]  younger daughter who had been vaccinated at two months and she started
[02:54:21.500 --> 02:54:27.380]  twitching unusually and I thought something was odd but I wasn't sure
[02:54:27.380 --> 02:54:32.180]  until five months when she was diagnosed with something called tuberculosis
[02:54:32.180 --> 02:54:36.820]  complex yeah which long story shorted the rare genetic disorder that causes
[02:54:36.820 --> 02:54:44.540]  tumors in all major organs and one in of course it's genetic you can get lung
[02:54:44.540 --> 02:54:48.220]  cancer you smoke a bunch of cigarettes it means you have a predisposition but
[02:54:48.220 --> 02:54:51.380]  you understand they lie now and say everybody's getting type 1 because of
[02:54:51.380 --> 02:54:56.460]  genetics but in the inserts it admits that the vaccine is destroying the
[02:54:56.460 --> 02:55:00.100]  pancreas of children and then they're getting what they call genetic diabetes
[02:55:00.100 --> 02:55:06.980]  it's just not true go ahead oh I completely agree and and it was actually
[02:55:06.980 --> 02:55:11.020]  with research after listening to you and listening to vaccines we researched
[02:55:11.020 --> 02:55:14.940]  that was actually the DPT shot there was a case in the state who are a
[02:55:14.940 --> 02:55:18.860]  neurological doctor I believe his daughter had it and it was proven that
[02:55:18.860 --> 02:55:23.940]  the DPT shot caused this to happen so had we not given her the shot she would
[02:55:23.940 --> 02:55:29.700]  have lived a normal life but now we are stuck with the consequences because the
[02:55:29.700 --> 02:55:34.220]  doctors were not educated enough to do anything about it let me ask you this how
[02:55:34.220 --> 02:55:37.740]  much of the medical bears bills yearly because again it's not the doctors
[02:55:37.740 --> 02:55:41.460]  they're compartmentalized up above these big foundations that own the hospitals
[02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:45.180]  and run them they're making massive cash let me guess are her medical bills
[02:55:45.180 --> 02:55:51.420]  50,000 a year well we're from Canada so luckily OHIP is paying for it because
[02:55:51.420 --> 02:55:55.660]  quote-unquote it is genetic but her medicine is costing us 300 a month
[02:55:55.660 --> 02:56:00.900]  yeah and plus we have private speech therapy we've had lots of help a lot of
[02:56:00.900 --> 02:56:06.260]  intervention coming out of our pockets so it's able five grand a month only to
[02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:16.900]  well what's five five grand times 12 five is what 60 grand a year yeah well
[02:56:16.900 --> 02:56:21.620]  they've had a great victory well ma'am I pray for your daughter and all you can
[02:56:21.620 --> 02:56:26.660]  do is warn others that so this doesn't happen to them we are but we always get
[02:56:26.660 --> 02:56:31.580]  an uphill battle and it's to the point that we just told them to back off it's
[02:56:31.580 --> 02:56:36.940]  our child that the vaccines actually had affected her and everyone's worried oh
[02:56:36.940 --> 02:56:40.820]  but you're not vaccinated I go well why you worried because you are vaccinated
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:43.500]  oh yeah they're gonna still bully you into more they won't be happy until
[02:56:43.500 --> 02:56:47.260]  you're all dead God bless you ma'am and just tell your daughter I said hi I just
[02:56:47.260 --> 02:56:50.860]  it's just why don't do these shows so it really makes me angry I could open the
[02:56:50.860 --> 02:56:54.260]  phones up and say call in if you've had family members forcibly killed in
[02:56:54.260 --> 02:56:57.860]  hospitals where they turn off the water and food as they beg for water and food
[02:56:57.860 --> 02:57:01.540]  and people will call in I mean I mean you people have no idea the Holocaust that's

[03:00:06.260 --> 03:00:13.100]  Alex Jones main rebroadcast coming up Joe Biggs had been denied for about eight
[03:00:13.100 --> 03:00:17.540]  nine months health care and he's got shrapnel in him bullet holes bleeding
[03:00:17.540 --> 03:00:21.540]  lungs for being inside armored vehicles that were blown up twice until he started
[03:00:21.540 --> 03:00:24.180]  saying I know I'm on a no treat list I'm gonna do a press report about this
[03:00:24.180 --> 03:00:28.260]  suddenly he got health care they put a large number of vets on the do not
[03:00:28.260 --> 03:00:32.100]  treat list that's come out now for a year the caller was mentioning that and
[03:00:32.100 --> 03:00:37.100]  then yeah he was talking about his wife who's in the military being ordered to
[03:00:37.100 --> 03:00:42.420]  take a flu shot and then she had a miscarriage I mean you know it's 101 and
[03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:46.620]  the officers don't take it you know they've got Obama rolling up his sleeve
[03:00:46.620 --> 03:00:51.100]  the rest of it right now it's disgusting okay I mean I showed you the articles
[03:00:51.100 --> 03:00:54.740]  where the elites don't take regular vaccines and they're still danger even
[03:00:54.740 --> 03:00:59.300]  with the good clean ones but yeah you can't get immunity from them but a lot
[03:00:59.300 --> 03:01:02.900]  of it is incompetence bad facilities making it but a lot of us being spiked
[03:01:02.900 --> 03:01:07.700]  as well I mean it's just Russian or lead big time and but but Smedley Butler
[03:01:07.700 --> 03:01:11.460]  finishing up you were sitting here on the do not treat list and notice how that
[03:01:11.460 --> 03:01:15.180]  came out and then it was just out of the news
[03:01:15.180 --> 03:01:22.620]  yeah and now evidently I'm also on the do not let reproduce list so I guess
[03:01:22.620 --> 03:01:26.420]  every time your wife's pregnant it they'll just give her a shot and then
[03:01:26.420 --> 03:01:31.740]  that's it well the strange thing is that this year they were doing the nasal
[03:01:31.740 --> 03:01:37.260]  spray of the nasal inhalation for the flu yeah that's that was mandatory you
[03:01:37.260 --> 03:01:41.940]  know for everybody at the base and yeah you know that's live that's live virus
[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:47.180]  yeah yeah and they injected her with the the dead virus or the whatever it is you
[03:01:47.180 --> 03:01:52.540]  know and she
[03:01:53.700 --> 03:02:00.060]  shit I lost my train of thought here they gave her the shot specifically while
[03:02:00.060 --> 03:02:06.620]  everyone else was doing the inhalation so they killed my child absolutely and
[03:02:06.620 --> 03:02:10.260]  it's all done by computers like it was put in the file that she's pregnant she
[03:02:10.260 --> 03:02:14.340]  goes in to get you know that those type of services it's in a computer and the
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:18.100]  computer spits out probably an IBM Watson because that's who decides what
[03:02:18.100 --> 03:02:24.300]  trips to kill and what and then the Watson says terminate I'm not kidding
[03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:28.300]  they have a they have a Watson computer is what it's called the IBM made the
[03:02:28.300 --> 03:02:33.500]  Nazi machines as well and that's what decides what to do incredible so what
[03:02:33.500 --> 03:02:36.860]  does your wife think about all this now that that she's pregnant so she singled
[03:02:36.860 --> 03:02:42.860]  out for the injection she's thinking we're getting out of a military yeah
[03:02:42.860 --> 03:02:46.940]  alright God bless you though over there in Italy sir this is incredible yeah
[03:02:46.940 --> 03:02:50.380]  they're targeting the troops folks I mean it's it's unbelievable so if you
[03:02:50.380 --> 03:02:53.980]  support the troops stop letting them do experimental vaccines on them is he
[03:02:53.980 --> 03:03:00.700]  legal but they still do it I don't people to get drugs approved I'll just leave it
[03:03:00.700 --> 03:03:06.840]  at that and the way you fast-track stuff is you get a general involved and get
[03:03:06.840 --> 03:03:09.980]  a general in your company and then they'll get the strings pulled where
[03:03:09.980 --> 03:03:18.060]  they'll they'll test on troops you heard me right companies go and the troops
[03:03:18.060 --> 03:03:21.820]  that's why there's so many vaccine programs they're tested on just like the
[03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:25.540]  black people with syphilis I mean you can't make this up anytime you're a
[03:03:25.540 --> 03:03:30.580]  captive of these folks they will hurt you foster children almost 70% are on
[03:03:30.580 --> 03:03:35.640]  psychotropic drugs can in Arizona last call we have time for clone truth or
[03:03:35.640 --> 03:03:39.540]  patent John we're do this topic again tomorrow so we'll call you back but can
[03:03:39.540 --> 03:03:48.140]  go ahead hi I called him said that the public is the test group specifically
[03:03:48.140 --> 03:03:53.900]  the school system has two groups one is the uninoculated and one is the
[03:03:53.900 --> 03:03:59.340]  inoculated if you take the data for autism and find and just compare
[03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:04.780]  inoculated versus uninoculated due to autism the rate all that data is in the
[03:04:04.780 --> 03:04:08.900]  system so they don't have to do studies they can pull it up right now well
[03:04:08.900 --> 03:04:11.820]  they've actually done that private groups have and you know just it's
[03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:19.140]  unknown pretty much in children is mainly boys who get it because a weaker
[03:04:19.140 --> 03:04:22.620]  blood-brain barrier it's basically unknown in Amish communities unknown in
[03:04:22.620 --> 03:04:26.900]  third world communities that don't have any on the inoculations and unknown in
[03:04:26.900 --> 03:04:33.740]  the unvaccinated population if the data can be pulled up from the public school
[03:04:33.740 --> 03:04:38.460]  system presently that the kids with autism what percentage are inoculated
[03:04:38.460 --> 03:04:43.020]  versus not that that would be the proof right there over now well sir that did
[03:04:43.020 --> 03:04:47.460]  come out and the CDC ordered it covered up but yeah we should hire
[03:04:47.460 --> 03:04:51.220]  statisticians to go break those numbers down for us that's a great idea I wish
[03:04:51.220 --> 03:04:54.260]  we had the money to do that somebody should do that tonight nightly news
[03:04:54.260 --> 03:05:08.660]  seven o'clock central back here tomorrow 11 a.m.
