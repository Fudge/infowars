[00:00:03.226 --> 00:00:06.107]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:00:06.107 --> 00:00:06.647]  Let me think.
[00:00:06.647 --> 00:00:07.227]  Just let me think.
[00:00:07.227 --> 00:00:12.749]  I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns will still be on their way.
[00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:14.129]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.829]  Damn it!
[00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:15.889]  Why?
[00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.471]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:00:22.471 --> 00:00:25.652]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:33.259]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:34.300]  You designed it, sir.
[00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.240]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.901]  You taught me every television in London!
[00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.003]  Cruelty and injustice.
[00:00:39.003 --> 00:00:40.784]  Intolerance and oppression.
[00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:50.451]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:50.631]  Cameras.
[00:00:50.631 --> 00:00:51.652]  We need cameras.
[00:00:51.652 --> 00:00:53.073]  How did this happen?
[00:00:53.073 --> 00:00:53.854]  Who's to blame?
[00:00:54.818 --> 00:00:57.479]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:59.400]  They will be held accountable.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.484]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[00:01:06.484 --> 00:01:07.945]  I know why you did it.
[00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:09.986]  I know you were afraid.
[00:01:09.986 --> 00:01:10.586]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:01:11.186 --> 00:01:13.908]  War, terror, disease.
[00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:20.334]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[00:01:20.334 --> 00:01:26.739]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[00:01:26.739 --> 00:01:32.905]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[00:01:39.844 --> 00:01:41.305]  There is a war.
[00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:43.187]  It's happening now.
[00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:45.530]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.132]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:01:48.132 --> 00:01:50.034]  We are the resistance.
[00:01:50.034 --> 00:01:57.441]  We are the Infowar.
[00:01:57.441 --> 00:02:01.045]  And that intro that we just played is almost four years old!
[00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:08.017]  And I've got intros from 15 years ago saying we are the resistance.
[00:02:08.017 --> 00:02:10.819]  We are the information war.
[00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.020]  We're going to identify the authoritarian system of globalism.
[00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.341]  We're going to speak out against it.
[00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:21.163]  We're going to raise the alarm as modern-day Paul Revere's across the globe.
[00:02:21.163 --> 00:02:30.627]  And we are going to reinstitute the free market, capitalist, nation-state system of renaissance, prosperity, and the long march to the stars.
[00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:39.613]  The long, glorious, pioneer march to the stars and unlocking the secrets of the universe.
[00:02:39.613 --> 00:02:41.054]  And the globalists, they don't want that.
[00:02:41.054 --> 00:02:42.895]  They think they've already got the secrets.
[00:02:42.895 --> 00:02:44.215]  They've already got their AI.
[00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:48.297]  They want to wall us off from the future.
[00:02:48.297 --> 00:02:49.978]  But ladies and gentlemen, that's not going to happen.
[00:02:49.978 --> 00:03:00.644]  And now these enemies of progress, these enemies of freedom, these enemies of America, these enemies of Western civilization and Christianity that are in control of our governments,
[00:03:01.843 --> 00:03:07.026]  Are saying everyone that wants freedom is a Russian agent.
[00:03:07.026 --> 00:03:09.127]  Because we couldn't think for ourselves.
[00:03:09.127 --> 00:03:10.567]  We couldn't vote against Hillary.
[00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:11.168]  There it is!
[00:03:11.168 --> 00:03:13.949]  DrudgeReport.com.
[00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:14.669]  Media matters.
[00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:16.930]  That's Jordan Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:24.574]  Drudge infected America with Russian propaganda.
[00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:27.696]  And I guess he infected it with the New York Times, the Washington Post, and CNN.
[00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:28.776]  He links to everything.
[00:03:28.776 --> 00:03:29.537]  But there it is!
[00:03:31.328 --> 00:03:36.350]  And they track how he linked to Interfax, ITAR, TAS and Pravda.
[00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.712]  And he linked to the Japanese and Chinese and Mexican news too.
[00:03:39.712 --> 00:03:42.313]  And he linked to all their reports!
[00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:48.936]  Just like he links to the Media Matters report right there.
[00:03:48.936 --> 00:03:52.597]  I guess he's infecting us with Media Matters.
[00:03:52.597 --> 00:03:53.137]  Look at that!
[00:03:53.137 --> 00:03:55.418]  He's infecting us!
[00:03:55.418 --> 00:03:59.000]  He infected us with David Brock!
[00:04:00.117 --> 00:04:01.558]  And George Soros, no he didn't.
[00:04:01.558 --> 00:04:05.342]  He covered the full spectrum of the news, just like we do.
[00:04:05.342 --> 00:04:06.823]  But see, it's never going to end.
[00:04:06.823 --> 00:04:08.825]  We're all Russian agents.
[00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:10.386]  Oh, and Mueller.
[00:04:10.386 --> 00:04:12.669]  Mueller's closing in now.
[00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:21.136]  Oh, but it turns out Clapper now goes on CNN and reverses all his previous lies and says, we did spy on Trump.
[00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:23.178]  We did spy on Manafort.
[00:04:23.178 --> 00:04:24.760]  We did spy on Trump Tower.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.180]  We did.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:33.347]  Because he knows the President's in power now, and is able to bring that info out through the intelligence committees, through the proper channels, and you guys are a pack of criminals.
[00:04:34.448 --> 00:04:39.329]  Remember, Mueller is the king criminal, or the Lord High Protector of corruption.
[00:04:39.329 --> 00:04:49.572]  The Lord High Chancellor, the Defender of Evil, the Defender of the Faith and the Worship of Baphomet, and the Defender of the Great Pedophile Armies, the Defender of the Clintons.
[00:04:49.572 --> 00:04:51.633]  You want to know if Mueller's corrupt?
[00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:58.975]  Mueller is the great chess piece of this Luciferian conspiracy against Christ and against America.
[00:05:00.658 --> 00:05:02.760]  Joe Biggs here with InfoWars.com.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.083]  Today I want to talk to you about guns.
[00:05:05.083 --> 00:05:06.144]  Why we have them.
[00:05:06.144 --> 00:05:09.508]  Why the Bill of Rights guarantees that we can have them.
[00:05:09.508 --> 00:05:15.014]  And why my right to have a gun is more important than your right to rail against it in the press.
[00:05:15.014 --> 00:05:21.942]  I believe every good journalist needs to know why the Second Amendment must be considered more essential than the First Amendment.
[00:05:22.042 --> 00:05:32.788]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep and bear arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the redcoats.
[00:05:32.788 --> 00:05:36.250]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[00:05:38.331 --> 00:05:45.473]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contain ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[00:05:45.473 --> 00:05:48.134]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[00:05:48.134 --> 00:05:50.995]  It doesn't recognize color, or class, or wealth.
[00:05:50.995 --> 00:05:57.577]  It protects not just the rights of actors, or editors, or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[00:05:57.577 --> 00:06:00.078]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.783]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:06:05.783 --> 00:06:13.508]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:06:13.508 --> 00:06:22.154]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:06:22.154 --> 00:06:26.557]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:06:26.557 --> 00:06:31.720]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.362]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.783]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[00:06:39.783 --> 00:06:50.927]  AnthroPlex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[00:07:41.636 --> 00:07:46.101]  Emmerich's Essentials Mouthwash is a great addition to your daily brushing routine.
[00:07:46.101 --> 00:07:51.026]  It is effective, yet gentle enough for the most sensitive gums and canker sores.

[00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:58.073]  That's Infowarsstore.com.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.887]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial commons.
[00:08:17.887 --> 00:08:23.630]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:29.954]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[00:08:29.954 --> 00:08:31.235]  It is a big idea.
[00:08:31.235 --> 00:08:32.656]  A new world order.
[00:08:36.886 --> 00:08:39.588]  It was almost as if there were planned implosions.
[00:08:39.588 --> 00:08:40.569]  It just pancaked.
[00:08:40.569 --> 00:08:43.511]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[00:08:43.511 --> 00:09:00.945]  But I also believe we've got a lot of God on our shoulders.
[00:09:00.945 --> 00:09:06.389]  We agree that the KJ-47s belong to the hands of soldiers, not the hands of criminals.
[00:09:11.084 --> 00:09:11.664]  I'm done gloating.
[00:09:11.664 --> 00:09:13.846]  No one will be able to beat all of us.
[00:09:13.846 --> 00:09:16.067]  We're going to take all of you out.
[00:09:16.067 --> 00:09:19.550]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.151]  Global governance at last.
[00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.132]  Is it one world?
[00:09:22.132 --> 00:09:23.553]  The central bank is in charge.
[00:09:23.553 --> 00:09:26.855]  Aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[00:09:26.855 --> 00:09:31.958]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms.
[00:09:31.958 --> 00:09:33.700]  Do you understand?
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:38.423]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09:41.488 --> 00:09:46.389]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this worldwide broadcast.
[00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:50.450]  We're going to be here for the next four hours live.
[00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:56.651]  Mark Dice and many other amazing researchers are going to be joining us.
[00:09:56.651 --> 00:10:10.334]  But the big breaking news right now on this worldwide Thursday transmission is that Clapper now admits that Trump, quote, could have been wiretapped during the Manafort surveillance.
[00:10:11.715 --> 00:10:12.977]  And that's what Trump's always said.
[00:10:12.977 --> 00:10:23.533]  Trump Tower, his campaign head, his staff, and now we know they had foreign surveillance warrants and they had the Justice Department doing it separately.
[00:10:23.533 --> 00:10:26.277]  At least three different ones that they
[00:10:27.602 --> 00:10:29.183]  Parallel constructed.
[00:10:29.183 --> 00:10:32.765]  And what they do is they have massive surveillance on everything.
[00:10:32.765 --> 00:10:38.489]  They're reportedly giving access to a whole chain of high-level Democratic operatives.
[00:10:38.489 --> 00:10:48.996]  The Podestas and others could just dial into all the files, listen to people's phone calls, listen to all the recordings, go into whole databases of emails.
[00:10:48.996 --> 00:10:54.620]  Basically, Podesta, Hillary, all of them, Obama, admittedly,
[00:10:56.161 --> 00:10:56.301]  Yes.
[00:11:12.216 --> 00:11:18.379]  The department store, and they say, this may be monitored for quality assurance, or you call up the phone company.
[00:11:18.379 --> 00:11:19.640]  It's the same thing.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:33.886]  It's all recorded, and they've got heads-up, high-tech computer displays, and they can go in and go to somebody's name, they can hit another button, see all your relationships, everybody you know who they know, and they can just go in with one of those warrants.
[00:11:33.886 --> 00:11:36.868]  It's a blanket warrant to everything.
[00:11:36.868 --> 00:11:41.010]  But under parallel construction, this has been declassified and leaked in the last decade,
[00:11:42.145 --> 00:11:45.789]  First the DEA got caught doing it, and they have full access to all these databases.
[00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:53.517]  They go create their case first, then they go get warrants later, and then go re-engineer their criminal investigation that was criminal.
[00:11:54.582 --> 00:11:57.123]  And by that, doing it is totally illegal.
[00:11:57.123 --> 00:11:59.784]  They're very famous for planting things as well.
[00:11:59.784 --> 00:12:01.805]  So they weren't just rigging the polls.
[00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:04.566]  They weren't just giving Hillary all the questions for the debates.
[00:12:04.566 --> 00:12:16.870]  It wasn't just Hillary and her even low-level aides were on the phone with the New York Times editors every day telling them what to do and approving every story about Trump.
[00:12:21.121 --> 00:12:21.721]  You understand?
[00:12:21.721 --> 00:12:26.004]  And if you don't believe me about parallel construction, Reuters supposedly broke it four years ago.
[00:12:26.004 --> 00:12:28.386]  We broke it, of course, with our sources.
[00:12:28.386 --> 00:12:38.432]  But you can just type in a parallel construction DEA recreated criminal cases.
[00:12:38.432 --> 00:12:39.573]  And that's what they do.
[00:12:39.573 --> 00:12:42.395]  And so they've been up there lying the entire time.
[00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:44.696]  We're going to get into all that.
[00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:48.379]  MSNBC worries Trump use of the word sovereign is basically racist.
[00:12:49.195 --> 00:12:50.036]  That's globalism.
[00:12:50.036 --> 00:13:02.485]  That's why they're going to use this whole race narrative that if you have a nation, have a religion, have any type of freedom, well, you're a racist.
[00:13:02.485 --> 00:13:03.786]  That's the game the globals are playing.
[00:13:03.786 --> 00:13:09.111]  Because they've already exploited the third world, so now they're just going to go, oh, if you're Asian or Hispanic or black,
[00:13:10.129 --> 00:13:11.770]  or Arabic.
[00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:15.131]  Whites are the devil and we're going to politically destroy them.
[00:13:15.131 --> 00:13:20.374]  But it's a bunch of old, weird, robber baron, white people captaining it and quarterbacking it.
[00:13:20.374 --> 00:13:24.496]  It's ridiculously obvious.
[00:13:24.496 --> 00:13:28.238]  Now, continuing.
[00:13:28.238 --> 00:13:37.142]  We're going to get into Trump saying that Rand Paul is, quote, a negative force when it comes to fixing health care.
[00:13:37.142 --> 00:13:38.603]  No, Mr. President.
[00:13:43.146 --> 00:14:01.259]  Rand Paul is extremely informed, and extremely professional, and extremely honorable, and it's John McCain that said he'd vote for that repeal bill that was pretty good a few weeks ago, a month ago, and then he had to run off for his brain tumor surgery, and then he came back.
[00:14:01.259 --> 00:14:08.604]  Once he was the victim, he could then turn on all of his constituents and vote against the repeal of Obamacare.
[00:14:08.604 --> 00:14:11.266]  So it's John McCain
[00:14:12.557 --> 00:14:17.738]  The new bill we've got is a screw job, and Rand Paul breaks it down.
[00:14:17.738 --> 00:14:20.139]  We have his breakdowns at Infowars.com.
[00:14:20.139 --> 00:14:22.359]  Is it better than Obamacare?
[00:14:22.359 --> 00:14:26.660]  Yeah, it's like, do you want to be shot by a .22 in the foot?
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:30.881]  Or do you want to be shot with a 12-gauge with double-aught buck in the chest?
[00:14:30.881 --> 00:14:39.783]  Well, I don't want to be shot with a .22 in the foot, and I don't want to be shot with buckshot in the chest, but if I gotta take one, I'll take the .22 long rifle to the foot.
[00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.052]  And so Rand Paul's completely right.
[00:14:44.052 --> 00:14:50.997]  And I get Trump is a pragmatist and just wants to get rid of Obamacare because it's designed to bankrupt the economy.
[00:14:50.997 --> 00:14:58.864]  It's designed to not just bring down health care, but with Cloward and Piven strategies, according to Ezekiel Emanuel on Fox News and Pocahontas.
[00:14:58.864 --> 00:15:01.386]  Senator Warren, they've all... Should I play the clips again?
[00:15:02.421 --> 00:15:16.045]  From four years ago and a year ago and two weeks ago, Pocahontas came back out and said, yeah, we plan to bankrupt the economy with Obamacare and reorganize it and have a single payer, but run by private corporations, a massive screw job.
[00:15:16.045 --> 00:15:17.145]  So that's coming up.
[00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:20.746]  I'm going to go into detail on that.
[00:15:20.746 --> 00:15:24.967]  And there's just so much more.
[00:15:24.967 --> 00:15:31.409]  There's some good comedy with Lawrence O'Donnell, who's such a contentious, arrogant, conceited,
[00:15:33.246 --> 00:15:37.029]  entitled brat.
[00:15:37.029 --> 00:15:56.642]  The only other person that oozed more fake gravitas and more puffery and sycophantic fop behavior was that Pele guy that finally got removed from 60 Minutes because he was just an arrogant idiot in a suit knowing Hillary never fell down.
[00:15:57.847 --> 00:16:02.091]  You just made that up and Cernovich goes, well yes she did and she was really sick.
[00:16:02.091 --> 00:16:07.237]  Well the campaign said it was pneumonia.
[00:16:07.237 --> 00:16:09.439]  The campaign said it was pneumonia?
[00:16:09.439 --> 00:16:12.042]  And Cernovich goes, we don't believe Hillary.
[00:16:12.042 --> 00:16:12.863]  She's a liar.
[00:16:14.522 --> 00:16:16.063]  And they left it in 60 minutes.
[00:16:16.063 --> 00:16:17.865]  He was the producer of that, too.
[00:16:17.865 --> 00:16:21.668]  Thinking, well, I'm in the big suit, acting all puffy.
[00:16:21.668 --> 00:16:25.030]  How dare you say the moon is round?
[00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.553]  How dare you say the ocean is wet and the sky is blue?
[00:16:28.553 --> 00:16:32.456]  We say Hillary's an angel, a goddess!
[00:16:32.456 --> 00:16:41.963]  Remember those CNN videos where they have her glowing and turn the iris up all the way with her wearing a white Princess Leia outfit being praised by a bunch of women?
[00:16:41.963 --> 00:16:43.845]  And they went, she's a goddess!
[00:16:45.256 --> 00:16:53.703]  No, she's an old, evil, demonic woman with a trail of destruction and death and everything else behind them.
[00:16:53.703 --> 00:16:58.306]  We don't care if you have her glow like some goddess come down from heaven.
[00:16:58.306 --> 00:17:06.773]  If you were up in your attic or something and saw something like that, you'd be sure you'd seen the devil.
[00:17:06.773 --> 00:17:08.635]  The devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[00:17:08.635 --> 00:17:13.539]  Well, there ain't much masquerading there.
[00:17:13.539 --> 00:17:13.919]  Looks like
[00:17:16.277 --> 00:17:20.801]  Pennywise meets the church lady.
[00:17:20.801 --> 00:17:25.205]  Then we're getting into this huge news, and this is so important because I've seen this happen.
[00:17:25.205 --> 00:17:33.372]  I saw them open up or call for opening up a criminal investigation of myself, Drudge, Breitbart.
[00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:35.674]  That's pretty much it.
[00:17:35.674 --> 00:17:39.297]  Claiming we're directed by the Russians and get money from the Russians.
[00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:49.476]  And I noticed, and I'm not complaining, that the minute that happened, Drudge went from linking to us like once a week or something to like once a month, which is fine.
[00:17:49.476 --> 00:17:50.756]  Drudge can never link to me again.
[00:17:50.756 --> 00:17:51.197]  I love him.
[00:17:51.197 --> 00:17:51.897]  He's awesome.
[00:17:51.897 --> 00:17:52.357]  He's great.
[00:17:52.357 --> 00:17:53.158]  Trailblazer.
[00:17:53.158 --> 00:17:55.460]  Done so much for independent media in America and the world.
[00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:55.860]  That's fine.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.341]  But I can put two and two together.
[00:17:57.341 --> 00:18:03.025]  They opened up in Congress saying, we're criminally investigating Alex Jones and Drudge and all these groups.
[00:18:03.025 --> 00:18:05.286]  You know, we've opened up this espionage deal.
[00:18:05.286 --> 00:18:06.667]  Of course, it's totally made up.
[00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:12.631]  And then you hear the Federal Elections Commission go, yeah, we want a criminal investigation of Alex Jones and Matt Drudge and Breitbart.
[00:18:16.594 --> 00:18:22.498]  And Drudge is linking to the New York Times, the Washington Post, everybody, more than he links to me or WorldNetDaily or whatever.
[00:18:22.498 --> 00:18:28.462]  You could say Drudge is now working for Media Matters.
[00:18:28.462 --> 00:18:29.503]  Of course he's not.
[00:18:29.503 --> 00:18:35.968]  He's linking to George Soros' fiction publication, Media Matters, run by the discredited David Brock.
[00:18:37.193 --> 00:18:41.377]  And the Democrats' fundraising is down 75% and this guy's one of the main reasons.
[00:18:41.377 --> 00:18:42.578]  He's a total joke.
[00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:48.643]  But Drudge is linking to it to show you the garbage they're putting out.
[00:18:48.643 --> 00:18:49.183]  And here it is.
[00:18:49.183 --> 00:18:58.131]  They have a big report out that Drudge is the Russian propaganda combine.
[00:18:58.131 --> 00:19:04.276]  How Matt Drudge became the pipeline for Russia propaganda because, oh my gosh, look, he linked some
[00:19:06.892 --> 00:19:12.677]  He linked, oh my gosh, to Russian news and he sent massive traffic there.
[00:19:12.677 --> 00:19:16.220]  Well, of course he did.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:22.144]  And as we get more Russian-centric news coverage, of course he linked to it more because he rushes all over the news.
[00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:23.906]  But see, they show graphs.
[00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:27.587]  And they go, look, it's increasing, he's under their control.
[00:19:27.587 --> 00:19:29.928]  No, all the news has been covering Russia.
[00:19:29.928 --> 00:19:34.769]  If you showed graphs of the rest of the media's coverage of Russia, it's five times that!
[00:19:34.769 --> 00:19:36.410]  It's stratospheric!
[00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.110]  But see, there's the proof!
[00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:43.892]  He's a Russian, he linked to the... Shut him down!
[00:19:46.098 --> 00:19:59.205]  It's all made up bullying, hoping they can overthrow Trump, overturn the election like Hillary still says she wants to do, she said that two days ago, and then shutting down the media, overturning all the elections, taking over the states, and having a permanent dictatorship.
[00:20:00.203 --> 00:20:06.364]  With nearly 70 years of history engineering bunkers, today Atlas Survival Shelters is still the authority.

[00:20:59.989 --> 00:21:01.950]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:21:01.950 --> 00:21:08.854]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:21:08.854 --> 00:21:17.199]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:21:17.199 --> 00:21:22.903]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:21:23.283 --> 00:21:24.885]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:21:24.885 --> 00:21:27.147]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:21:27.147 --> 00:21:31.572]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:21:31.572 --> 00:21:33.754]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[00:21:33.754 --> 00:21:41.483]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[00:21:41.783 --> 00:21:42.384]  We're good to go.
[00:21:59.105 --> 00:22:03.569]  It's been said, any society is only three missed meals away from chaos.
[00:22:03.569 --> 00:22:05.171]  Those times may be near.
[00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:06.071]  Think about it.
[00:22:06.071 --> 00:22:10.676]  Our country faces multiple terrorist threats and aggressions from Russia and North Korea.
[00:22:10.676 --> 00:22:15.320]  Social unrest and violent marches yet again may lead to looting of stores and city shutdowns.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:21.486]  And our crumbling infrastructure leaves our power grid vulnerable to long-term outages from a single cyber attack.
[00:22:21.486 --> 00:22:28.192]  When the chaos from any one of these threats arises, the government knows it can't provide during a widespread national emergency.
[00:22:28.192 --> 00:22:30.735]  That's why you need your own plan for self-reliance.
[00:22:31.175 --> 00:22:33.977]  That's where My Patriot Supply comes in.

[00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:31.051]  You've heard the phrase, you are what you eat?
[00:23:31.051 --> 00:23:31.832]  Not true.
[00:23:31.832 --> 00:23:33.673]  Actually, you are what you can absorb.
[00:23:33.673 --> 00:23:37.615]  So if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed, what good are they?
[00:23:37.615 --> 00:23:38.736]  Introducing Protovite.

[00:24:10.118 --> 00:24:10.941]  Yeah!
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:40.389]  Members of the Federal Election Commission, Democrats, have called for criminal investigations by the FBI and for congressional hearings about Infowars.com, DrudgeReport.com and Breitbart.com.
[00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:48.534]  Now all Americans, regardless of what your political views are, should rally to the support of the independent and free press.
[00:24:48.534 --> 00:24:54.037]  But you should also be outraged that they've now leveled a full attack on Matt Drudge.
[00:24:55.390 --> 00:25:05.956]  How Matt Drudge became the pipeline for Russian propaganda, Drudge's report has linked nearly 400 times to RT, Sputnik News, tossed since 2012.
[00:25:05.956 --> 00:25:13.460]  Uh, yeah, he's probably linked to the New York Times, I would guess, 2,000 times?
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:15.241]  I mean, the New York Times is on there every day.
[00:25:15.241 --> 00:25:18.243]  Does that mean that he works for the New York Times?
[00:25:18.243 --> 00:25:19.724]  This is, this is true
[00:25:20.956 --> 00:25:26.380]  McCarthyism, but it's being done by the leftists that loved Russia back when it was communist.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:28.421]  Now they hate it because it's Christian.
[00:25:28.421 --> 00:25:30.162]  And here is Matt Drudge.
[00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:30.982]  Media matters.
[00:25:30.982 --> 00:25:37.667]  Drudge infected America with Russian propaganda.
[00:25:37.667 --> 00:25:38.127]  That's right.
[00:25:38.127 --> 00:25:43.070]  So, being able to read what somebody else said is infected.
[00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:47.293]  Oh, but funny, we've got him linked to all the other mainstream media.
[00:25:47.293 --> 00:25:49.915]  Look, he's linked to the San Francisco gate.
[00:25:50.973 --> 00:25:53.337]  San Francisco Chronicle right here.
[00:25:53.337 --> 00:25:56.161]  Oh look, he's linked to the New York Post right here.
[00:25:56.161 --> 00:25:59.347]  Oh look, he's linked to the LA Times right here.
[00:25:59.347 --> 00:26:00.689]  I'm just going to link by link.
[00:26:00.689 --> 00:26:04.976]  Oh, he's linked to the News of Australia.
[00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.531]  And out of Germany.
[00:26:08.531 --> 00:26:10.111]  Oh my gosh!
[00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:13.452]  Monsanto's new weed killer divides farmers.
[00:26:13.452 --> 00:26:14.933]  New York Times!
[00:26:14.933 --> 00:26:16.773]  Oh my gosh, he linked C!
[00:26:16.773 --> 00:26:19.034]  Oh my gosh, I think he's linked four or five times today.
[00:26:19.034 --> 00:26:22.335]  Oh my gosh, Matt Grudge works for the New York Times.
[00:26:22.335 --> 00:26:24.036]  No, he doesn't!
[00:26:24.036 --> 00:26:29.537]  This is the biggest bullying, disinfo, lying crud.
[00:26:29.537 --> 00:26:31.138]  And they're trying to build a case
[00:26:32.128 --> 00:26:36.371]  To keep pushing these criminal investigations that have been closed.
[00:26:36.371 --> 00:26:51.162]  They had a counter-espionage investigation of the independent media earlier this year, even when the president was just getting into office, by the Democrat moles inside the FBI, and there was nothing there, because there is nothing.
[00:26:51.162 --> 00:26:57.867]  That's how Paul Watson has said he knows the Russian thing's made up, when they started listing him as a Russian operative.
[00:26:57.867 --> 00:27:00.509]  But look, Silicon Valley giant to give people
[00:27:01.658 --> 00:27:03.478]  Varied amounts of cash.
[00:27:03.478 --> 00:27:04.519]  CNBC.
[00:27:04.519 --> 00:27:05.979]  Drudge works for them.
[00:27:05.979 --> 00:27:09.160]  Latest basic income trial.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.360]  CNBC.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.661]  Hundreds missing in Mexico City days after earthquake.
[00:27:13.661 --> 00:27:14.421]  Wall Street Journal.
[00:27:14.421 --> 00:27:15.482]  Oh, he works for them.
[00:27:15.482 --> 00:27:17.322]  Rich-poor band together.
[00:27:17.322 --> 00:27:18.082]  Washington Post.
[00:27:18.082 --> 00:27:19.102]  Oh, he works for them.
[00:27:19.102 --> 00:27:21.423]  The group sworn to destroy Trump.
[00:27:21.423 --> 00:27:24.964]  Quake swarms under Washington volcano.
[00:27:24.964 --> 00:27:26.044]  Unusual.
[00:27:26.044 --> 00:27:27.225]  Seattle Times.
[00:27:27.225 --> 00:27:28.525]  Oh, he works for those dirty liberals.
[00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:34.690]  Pope admits church arrived late in confronting child abuse.
[00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:36.130]  Reuters!
[00:27:36.130 --> 00:27:39.531]  He just works for all the... Oh, he's linked to Time Magazine.
[00:27:39.531 --> 00:27:42.132]  Matt Drudge works for Time Warner.
[00:27:42.132 --> 00:27:44.052]  This is how they play games, folks.
[00:27:44.052 --> 00:27:51.794]  You read the report, it says, look, he linked hundreds of times in the last six years to Russian news.
[00:27:51.794 --> 00:27:53.654]  Well, of course he did.
[00:27:53.654 --> 00:27:56.915]  We've linked hundreds and hundreds of times, and we've linked hundreds and hundreds of times to everything else.
[00:27:56.915 --> 00:27:57.635]  That's what we do.
[00:27:59.241 --> 00:28:02.205]  But again, they play this game with these graphs to make it look all dirty.
[00:28:02.205 --> 00:28:05.070]  Oh look, it's increased too.
[00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:07.654]  They say the Sputnik coverage.
[00:28:07.654 --> 00:28:09.576]  That's one of these Russian news websites.
[00:28:10.984 --> 00:28:16.127]  Look, Sputnik didn't even exist until a couple years ago, but they've got Sputnik graphs here.
[00:28:16.127 --> 00:28:31.636]  So, A, the graph isn't even accurate, but B, when you look at all this, again, of course Russian news increased during the election, because Drudge will show the New York Times his claims about Russians, then he'll have a link to Russia to get their view on it.
[00:28:31.636 --> 00:28:36.099]  That's what you do as a journalist, is you put both sides out there.
[00:28:37.145 --> 00:28:43.429]  But this is an attempt again with a new Red Scare to bully, bully, bully, bully, bully.
[00:28:43.429 --> 00:28:53.274]  And if they're able to get Trump and then have new elections, which Hillary said two days ago they want, they are never going to let this country go back to being free again.
[00:28:53.274 --> 00:28:57.176]  They're going to have staged elections just like Venezuela.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:09.731]  It is incredible that we sit here with these dangerous, anti-American, authoritarian dirtbags who've told their
[00:29:11.129 --> 00:29:22.855]  Victims, they're zombie supporters, to go out and beat up conservatives, to beat up libertarians, to beat up Christians, to beat up people at prayer vigils, who are black, white, Hispanic, Asian, you name it.
[00:29:22.855 --> 00:29:26.918]  To beat up transsexuals that are Trump supporters.
[00:29:26.918 --> 00:29:36.023]  To just be vicious, horrible, nasty scum, run by a war criminal, Nazi collaborator.
[00:29:36.023 --> 00:29:39.605]  What a disgusting group of dangerous filth.
[00:29:40.589 --> 00:29:43.093]  Media matters is.
[00:29:43.093 --> 00:29:44.335]  And again, does drugs work for him?
[00:29:44.335 --> 00:29:45.216]  He just linked to them.
[00:29:45.216 --> 00:29:45.957]  No.
[00:29:45.957 --> 00:29:48.280]  He's exposing their fraud.
[00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.222]  We'll be back.
[00:29:49.222 --> 00:29:50.624]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.624 --> 00:29:53.148]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.148 --> 00:29:55.852]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.258 --> 00:30:16.168]  All the perplexities, the confusion and distress in America arise not from objects in their constitution or confederation, not from want of honor or virtue, so much as from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin, credit and circulation.
[00:30:16.168 --> 00:30:20.471]  Those are the words of John Adams, the second president of the United States.
[00:30:20.471 --> 00:30:22.433]  Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:25.675]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[00:30:25.675 --> 00:30:32.340]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:37.063]  What kind of leverage do these people in the Federal Reserve have over the American people?
[00:30:37.063 --> 00:30:40.826]  Or for that matter, what kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[00:30:41.386 --> 00:30:43.868]  Will you be a slave or will you be free?
[00:30:43.868 --> 00:30:48.872]  Adams also said, liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people.
[00:30:48.872 --> 00:30:50.193]  Join the InfoWars.
[00:30:50.193 --> 00:30:51.514]  Spread the information.

[00:30:55.156 --> 00:30:57.118]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knightman.

[00:31:09.945 --> 00:31:18.350]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade-grown Arabica beans.
[00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:23.233]  We have now managed to secure the sought-after beans in a highly customized blend.

[00:31:37.184 --> 00:31:44.211]  Hands down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[00:31:44.211 --> 00:31:48.555]  Drop by the site today, order a bag or two, and I don't think you're going to be disappointed.

[00:32:23.458 --> 00:32:31.286]  In the history of Infowarslife, we've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, Super Mill Vitality, and so many others.

[00:32:41.474 --> 00:32:43.516]  And this part is most important.
[00:32:43.516 --> 00:32:50.341]  The ingredients in Vitamin Mineral Fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[00:32:50.341 --> 00:32:51.782]  That means it's clean.
[00:32:51.782 --> 00:32:52.923]  That means it's pure.
[00:32:52.923 --> 00:32:55.825]  And rest secured, you're fighting the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.
[00:32:55.825 --> 00:32:58.607]  That's InfoWarsLives.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:32:58.607 --> 00:33:00.249]  Take action now before we sell out.
[00:33:13.442 --> 00:33:21.945]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:33:21.945 --> 00:33:26.326]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:26.326 --> 00:33:30.467]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:30.467 --> 00:33:32.968]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.968 --> 00:33:34.809]  It is Thursday, the 21st day
[00:33:39.091 --> 00:33:39.951]  Of September 2017.
[00:33:39.951 --> 00:33:45.213]  Hard to believe soon 2017 will be gone as well.
[00:33:45.213 --> 00:33:47.114]  You can put it up on screen if you want, guys.
[00:33:47.114 --> 00:33:50.215]  A little joke.
[00:33:50.215 --> 00:33:59.098]  Photoshopped, somebody did online, of myself, Trump and Vladimir Putin all riding together on the same horse.
[00:33:59.098 --> 00:34:01.638]  Shirtless.
[00:34:01.638 --> 00:34:06.480]  But, you know, this really is a big joke and we should recognize it as a joke.
[00:34:07.790 --> 00:34:14.638]  But at the same time, understand that the people pushing this whole narrative are really, really nasty, nasty globalists.
[00:34:14.638 --> 00:34:27.413]  And it was Matt, one of the producers that just pointed out, if you just joined us, that the Democrat Party funded, Hillary Clinton, John Podesta directed, George Soros funded media matters.
[00:34:28.959 --> 00:34:36.665]  Has called for criminal investigations of myself for working with Russia, and they've had members of the Federal Elections Commission, and members of Congress, and they've had hearings.
[00:34:36.665 --> 00:34:38.346]  We've played those.
[00:34:38.346 --> 00:34:48.954]  And let me tell you, when you're sitting there watching C-SPAN, and they're having armed service committee hearings, just saying, and Alex Jones, who works for Russia, and Alex Jones, who gets paid by Russia.
[00:34:48.954 --> 00:34:52.617]  Yeah, I get paid by our listeners funding our operation.
[00:34:52.617 --> 00:34:53.778]  It's insane.
[00:34:55.063 --> 00:35:08.507]  But it shows what criminals they are, and it shows how Hillary actually got money from the Russians, and so did Podesta, and they were scared that Trump was going to go after them for that, so they jumped on the Russia narrative first.
[00:35:08.507 --> 00:35:10.008]  No one in New York City and D.C.
[00:35:10.008 --> 00:35:13.209]  you can't swing a stick and not hit a Russian or a Chinese operative.
[00:35:14.099 --> 00:35:27.872]  And knowing some of the people were going to talk to him, you know, Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee, Judicial Committee, people like Sessions had met with the Russian ambassador three times in 2016 in his capacity as a senator.
[00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:30.755]  Turned out Pelosi met with him 30 plus times that year.
[00:35:30.755 --> 00:35:34.839]  Then she said she hadn't, but there were photos in the guest book and everything else.
[00:35:34.839 --> 00:35:38.082]  So they're playing this giant game because we're the Americans.
[00:35:38.883 --> 00:35:40.604]  We're the folks that want sovereignty.
[00:35:40.604 --> 00:35:51.171]  We're the people that are standing up for getting the stock market up, getting factory jobs back in, controlling our borders, deporting people that commit aggravated felonies.
[00:35:51.171 --> 00:35:52.652]  But they've got a big report.
[00:35:52.652 --> 00:35:53.393]  Media matters.
[00:35:53.393 --> 00:35:57.195]  Drudge infected America with Russian propaganda.
[00:35:57.195 --> 00:35:59.276]  And then they say, oh, over?
[00:36:00.350 --> 00:36:04.073]  Four and a half years, he linked to them 400 times.
[00:36:04.073 --> 00:36:04.854]  Whoop-dee-dah!
[00:36:04.854 --> 00:36:06.996]  I'm surprised it's only 400 times.
[00:36:06.996 --> 00:36:10.499]  He's got a couple links today to the New York Times.
[00:36:10.499 --> 00:36:18.026]  In fact, you could actually argue, hey, Drudge, you're the biggest website in the world, why are you sending all the traffic to the Washington Post and the New York Times and all the establishment guys?
[00:36:18.026 --> 00:36:19.307]  Well, you want to hear what they're saying.
[00:36:19.307 --> 00:36:20.388]  I'm not criticizing that.
[00:36:22.637 --> 00:36:28.960]  But they all know full well, thousands of times he's linked to the New York Times compared to 400 to Russian News.
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:37.205]  And why wouldn't you link to the English-Russian News when they've got wildfires or earthquakes or Ukraine news or political stuff to get multiple sides?
[00:36:37.205 --> 00:36:39.426]  You go to CNN, you get their view.
[00:36:39.426 --> 00:36:41.247]  You go to the Washington Post, you get their view.
[00:36:41.247 --> 00:36:44.429]  You go to Drudge Report, you get the whole thing.
[00:36:44.429 --> 00:36:46.210]  There's like 60, 70 articles every day.
[00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.772]  Same thing with Infowars.com or Newswars.com.
[00:36:51.277 --> 00:37:00.467]  You go there, in fact my own listeners go, why are you linked to the New York Times or the Washington Post or why did you link to Hillary saying something evil and putting out her propaganda?
[00:37:00.467 --> 00:37:03.130]  I want you to hear what the witch said!
[00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:12.140]  Lawrence O'Donnell is blowing up in this new video from behind the scenes during breaks because they let a conservative say something he didn't like that made too much sense.
[00:37:14.016 --> 00:37:17.137]  He wanted it edited down where it didn't make sense.
[00:37:17.137 --> 00:37:18.778]  That's what they do.
[00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:19.998]  He's like, what'd you do?
[00:37:19.998 --> 00:37:21.478]  That made too much sense.
[00:37:21.478 --> 00:37:23.259]  Now I've got to respond to it.
[00:37:23.259 --> 00:37:26.940]  You're supposed to edit it to not make any sense.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:30.821]  Just like they did with Megyn Kelly.
[00:37:30.821 --> 00:37:35.123]  The people saw that it was just incoherent gibbering and jump cuts and
[00:37:36.812 --> 00:37:37.873]  It wasn't what I said.
[00:37:37.873 --> 00:37:48.598]  They take things I said 10 minutes, 30 minutes apart from 8 hours of interviews and just weld them together and we released, obviously, excerpts of audio showing the fraud.
[00:37:48.598 --> 00:37:53.460]  Our videos exposing her had more views than her show on NBC.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.321]  Just our YouTubes and Facebooks.
[00:37:56.221 --> 00:37:57.903]  Again, they're a husk.
[00:37:57.903 --> 00:37:58.944]  They're a joke.
[00:37:58.944 --> 00:37:59.805]  They're over.
[00:37:59.805 --> 00:38:01.066]  What are they going to do?
[00:38:01.066 --> 00:38:02.248]  Do they thank Drudge?
[00:38:02.248 --> 00:38:06.873]  Sending them the majority of their traffic at the New York Times is from Matt Drudge?
[00:38:06.873 --> 00:38:07.693]  The Washington Post?
[00:38:07.693 --> 00:38:08.134]  No.
[00:38:08.134 --> 00:38:11.517]  They all write articles about how evil Drudge is and how he's a Russian.
[00:38:11.517 --> 00:38:11.878]  Oh, here.
[00:38:11.878 --> 00:38:13.099]  Here's all your traffic.
[00:38:13.099 --> 00:38:14.401]  Oh, screw you, Russian!
[00:38:19.502 --> 00:38:24.125]  Just a month ago, Federal Elections Commission member, Democrat, wants criminal investigation.
[00:38:24.125 --> 00:38:25.286]  They already had one.
[00:38:25.286 --> 00:38:26.526]  There was nothing there.
[00:38:26.526 --> 00:38:31.449]  They already had an FBI counter-espionage investigation.
[00:38:31.449 --> 00:38:32.190]  Look at this.
[00:38:32.190 --> 00:38:33.391]  This is dangerous.
[00:38:33.391 --> 00:38:36.192]  But what did Matt point out?
[00:38:36.192 --> 00:38:36.693]  He goes, Alex,
[00:38:38.447 --> 00:38:50.713]  He goes, you notice they're demonizing Trump on CNN, MSNBC, ABC News, breathlessly that he kept saying nationalism, nationalism, nation states are for their people, not to an international combine.
[00:38:50.713 --> 00:38:52.974]  We should all work together internationally.
[00:38:52.974 --> 00:39:00.837]  We should have global trade, but not globalism that transfers the power to unelected systems like the TPP.
[00:39:00.837 --> 00:39:06.440]  Folks, just a year ago, they wouldn't let members of Congress see the TPP.
[00:39:07.813 --> 00:39:18.086]  Then there was a big enough hue and cry in the last months of the election, they would let senior members go in a room without their cell phones to read one piece of paper at a time of over 10,000 pages.
[00:39:21.001 --> 00:39:25.103]  That's how you conquer a nation, with a bunch of bureaucratic takeover, not armies.
[00:39:25.103 --> 00:39:27.025]  We'd fight armies!
[00:39:27.025 --> 00:39:39.372]  But if, oh, if it's waves of children coming in, and the UN, and refugees, and global government, and loving, and it's helpful, and, you know, virtue signal, you're a white supremacist, if you don't turn yourself over to world government!
[00:39:39.372 --> 00:39:42.294]  If you don't accept Obamacare, written by the Republicans!
[00:39:44.673 --> 00:39:52.062]  And so he pointed out MSNBC worries Trump uses the word sovereign as a racist dog whistle.
[00:39:52.062 --> 00:39:55.246]  They said it was over the top.
[00:39:55.246 --> 00:40:03.676]  A loving, focused, good speech about free market and capitalism and brotherhood of humankind and all of this.
[00:40:05.902 --> 00:40:07.703]  And they're like, oh, did you hear it?
[00:40:07.703 --> 00:40:09.284]  Oh, the code words.
[00:40:09.284 --> 00:40:18.350]  The code words, like our government doesn't have one-sided tariffs where all the jobs go to China, where they're slave factories, so Apple can make billions more a day?
[00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:22.573]  I mean, Apple's making billions a day or so.
[00:40:22.573 --> 00:40:24.354]  Every couple days, they make a billion dollars.
[00:40:24.354 --> 00:40:25.755]  They got suicide factories.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.742]  But it's okay, because it's like, we're ample!
[00:40:29.742 --> 00:40:30.824]  We're liberal!
[00:40:30.824 --> 00:40:32.465]  We said you were white supremacists!
[00:40:32.465 --> 00:40:34.408]  Shut up about our death factories!
[00:40:34.408 --> 00:40:39.653]  Shut up about 18-hour workdays, forced drugging, robots we tried to bring in to replace people didn't work.
[00:40:39.653 --> 00:40:40.614]  Shut up!
[00:40:40.614 --> 00:40:44.539]  We've got hippie beards that act non-threatening!
[00:40:44.539 --> 00:40:47.342]  When behind the scenes, they're psycho demons!
[00:40:48.686 --> 00:40:52.830]  Clearly they got rid of Jobs because he wouldn't play games against the American people.
[00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:57.754]  Jobs said, don't let your kids have iPads, don't let your kids watch TV, it's ruining their brains.
[00:40:57.754 --> 00:41:01.877]  Oh, here, here's some weaponized cancer, brother.
[00:41:01.877 --> 00:41:06.942]  So, these people mean business, okay?
[00:41:06.942 --> 00:41:08.803]  They mean business.
[00:41:08.803 --> 00:41:16.130]  And, oh, look, they've got Drudge's hat, his little classic straw hat fedora, and they've got it red, white, and blue, the Russian colors.
[00:41:19.295 --> 00:41:21.997]  But even when they lie, they tell the truth, because Drudge is red, white, and blue.
[00:41:21.997 --> 00:41:27.362]  This isn't some gesticulation or exercise in kissing the butt of Matt Drudge.
[00:41:27.362 --> 00:41:32.906]  It's a fact that if they can bring him down, they can bring us all down, and they're trying to sell this idea and bully him.
[00:41:33.922 --> 00:41:57.497]  With the congressional hearings and everything, where they go, and Drudge amplifies Alex Jones and InfoWars, and we've got criminal investigations going, and then Drudge goes from linking to us every couple days to once a month, which is fine, because our listeners are pushing record traffic to InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com, and we understand that Drudge is under attack, and God knows what's happened to him behind the scenes.
[00:41:57.497 --> 00:42:02.160]  He gave us the only exclusive interview he's given in, like, two years.
[00:42:04.636 --> 00:42:08.381]  He did one other little ten minute one, but the last two years we've gotten the main interview.
[00:42:08.381 --> 00:42:10.263]  There's been two interviews, we got it.
[00:42:10.263 --> 00:42:10.924]  I love it!
[00:42:10.924 --> 00:42:18.093]  I'm not one of these people where somebody helps expand what we're doing 500% and does a great job and is a stalwart.
[00:42:19.724 --> 00:42:22.926]  And then, for whatever reason, doesn't link to us as much, that's fine!
[00:42:22.926 --> 00:42:26.428]  But I know this, Media Matters, is going, Matt Drudge, you better not link to Alex Jones!
[00:42:26.428 --> 00:42:27.728]  You better not link to Alex Jones!
[00:42:27.728 --> 00:42:28.969]  You better not link to Breitbart!
[00:42:28.969 --> 00:42:30.109]  You better not link to anybody else!
[00:42:30.109 --> 00:42:32.771]  You better leave all the libertarian and patriot sites alone!
[00:42:32.771 --> 00:42:48.079]  And this is all part of the isolating Trump, and isolating Drudge, and isolating Infowars, where they admit, oh, we've banned Breitbart and Infowars from Trump, because Breitbart and Infowars, CNN reported four months ago, say that there was warrantless wiretapping of Trump Tower against Manafort.
[00:42:50.598 --> 00:42:57.301]  And of course, now you learn months later, we were absolutely 110% on target and correct!
[00:42:57.301 --> 00:43:05.524]  That's why they don't want the President looking at DrudgeReport.com, because he saw the Infowars article.
[00:43:05.524 --> 00:43:09.565]  Let's just say I've talked to people very close to the President about it.
[00:43:09.565 --> 00:43:15.227]  They saw the Infowars story, and they are just horrified, because the President then went and pardoned him.
[00:43:15.227 --> 00:43:17.648]  They don't want him exercising executive authority.
[00:43:17.648 --> 00:43:19.509]  They don't want that, just like they don't want
[00:43:20.342 --> 00:43:26.144]  If they can't keep Drudge from the President, we'll just keep InfoWars from Drudge, you see.
[00:43:26.144 --> 00:43:29.324]  And people can say, well, you know, why is Drudge giving into that pressure?
[00:43:29.324 --> 00:43:32.966]  I'm not even sure that's the case, but clearly I think that's 2 plus 2 equals 4.
[00:43:32.966 --> 00:43:38.027]  The point is, is that this is how they're going to win, and everyone knows that.
[00:43:41.590 --> 00:43:46.772]  Drudge starts linking two or three times even more to mainstream news than he was.
[00:43:46.772 --> 00:43:52.694]  And the mouth of George Soros and Hillary says, we want to arrest you and shut you down.
[00:43:52.694 --> 00:43:54.975]  We've now, we think we've bullied you.
[00:43:54.975 --> 00:43:57.696]  Whether it's true or not, we think we've bullied you.
[00:43:57.696 --> 00:44:01.938]  So now we're going to rub your face in the mud while we piss on your back.
[00:44:01.938 --> 00:44:03.539]  Excuse the French.
[00:44:03.539 --> 00:44:05.920]  And that's it.
[00:44:05.920 --> 00:44:06.700]  And that's how this works.
[00:44:12.614 --> 00:44:14.535]  And it's incredible.
[00:44:14.535 --> 00:44:16.796]  The President needs an intelligence network.
[00:44:16.796 --> 00:44:22.138]  The President needs to see a video of Hillary doing something evil, or of what his constituents have to say.
[00:44:22.138 --> 00:44:23.018]  And that's what Drudge does.
[00:44:23.018 --> 00:44:24.399]  Links to YouTube, links to everything.
[00:44:24.399 --> 00:44:25.399]  It's wide spectrum.
[00:44:25.399 --> 00:44:27.920]  Whatever's interesting to Matt Drudge, he links to.
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:31.702]  Just like whatever's interesting to my writers and myself at InfoWars.com.
[00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:32.862]  Our listeners criticize us.
[00:44:32.862 --> 00:44:33.402]  They don't get it.
[00:44:33.402 --> 00:44:37.564]  They go, why are most of the links on your site to mainstream news?
[00:44:37.564 --> 00:44:39.845]  We're just showing you what the enemy's saying.
[00:44:41.144 --> 00:44:43.406]  It doesn't mean we work for the New York Times.
[00:44:43.406 --> 00:44:52.372]  When I link to RT, it's mainly because it's pretty balanced reporting on almost all issues, and they let us post the whole thing.
[00:44:52.372 --> 00:44:54.093]  We link to a lot of RT stuff.
[00:44:54.093 --> 00:44:58.516]  I mean, you read these RT articles, they are way more accurate when you've done the research.
[00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:06.012]  I mean, RT is giving Rand Paul a platform to talk about how this isn't a real repeal of Obamacare.
[00:45:06.012 --> 00:45:08.112]  Wow, what a great favor!
[00:45:08.112 --> 00:45:11.494]  The evil Russians are trying to get us a better deal on our healthcare.
[00:45:11.494 --> 00:45:13.274]  It's not that.
[00:45:13.274 --> 00:45:14.555]  Russia's been under oligarchs.
[00:45:14.555 --> 00:45:15.775]  Russia's been under elites.
[00:45:15.775 --> 00:45:17.796]  Russia's been under the very same robber barons.
[00:45:17.796 --> 00:45:27.879]  They understand it, and they're Christian now, and they're nationalistic now, and they're anti-radical Islam now, and they really want to dig out of this, and they want America to dig out of it with them.
[00:45:28.789 --> 00:45:32.891]  And that's why the globals are so pissed, and that is the Russian relationship.
[00:45:32.891 --> 00:45:39.913]  They just had a big Al-Qaeda-ISIS offensive, their last-ditch battle of the bulls against Syrian and Russian forces and U.S.
[00:45:39.913 --> 00:45:49.077]  forces, and so big bear bombers just bombed and killed 850-plus ISIS-Al-Qaeda fighters today.
[00:45:49.077 --> 00:45:54.319]  That's what the Russians are doing, is bombing radical jihadists right now with heavy bombers.
[00:45:55.737 --> 00:46:04.163]  That's what they're doing, turning back Al-Qaeda offensives that kill every Christian they get their filthy, dirty, maggot hands on.
[00:46:04.163 --> 00:46:15.290]  Meanwhile, the West is so sold out to radical Islam, from Germany to England to the U.S., if you criticize ISIS in your own blog, the Dean threatens to suspend you, or does suspend you.
[00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:17.111]  The government protects ISIS.
[00:46:17.111 --> 00:46:21.855]  They bring ISIS fighters back to Europe and give them better welfare than the general public gets.
[00:46:22.915 --> 00:46:23.816]  That's in the news.
[00:46:23.816 --> 00:46:30.661]  I've got stacks here where they're banning more outdoor beer festivals because the Muslims will attack them.
[00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:34.244]  They're attacking women that walk dogs, screaming dogs are unclean.
[00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:38.531]  The answer is, don't wear short panty skirts and don't walk dogs.
[00:46:38.531 --> 00:46:40.351]  Do what the Muslims want.
[00:46:40.351 --> 00:46:41.651]  Then, over to them.
[00:46:41.651 --> 00:46:47.592]  From Germany to Malaysia, they are banning their annual beer festivals.
[00:46:47.592 --> 00:46:51.493]  Because the Muslims will come up and blow your butt up!
[00:46:51.493 --> 00:46:53.574]  Or stab your ass!
[00:46:53.574 --> 00:46:55.754]  Because they're so tolerant!
[00:46:55.754 --> 00:46:56.914]  Let's go back to the article.
[00:46:56.914 --> 00:46:58.555]  There it is, InfoWars.com.
[00:46:58.555 --> 00:47:01.315]  Directly linked to the Malaysian News by Adan Salazar.
[00:47:01.315 --> 00:47:05.076]  Annual beer festival canned following protest from Islamicists.
[00:47:07.381 --> 00:47:09.363]  But let's go back to that clip I just mentioned.
[00:47:09.363 --> 00:47:09.923]  Video.
[00:47:09.923 --> 00:47:10.484]  MSNBC.
[00:47:10.484 --> 00:47:11.584]  Steve Watson article.
[00:47:11.584 --> 00:47:12.886]  NewsWars.com.
[00:47:12.886 --> 00:47:14.727]  MSNBC worries Trump.
[00:47:14.727 --> 00:47:18.710]  Use of the word sovereign is a dog whistle.
[00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:19.091]  That's right.
[00:47:19.091 --> 00:47:22.273]  Even saying we have a country is evil.
[00:47:22.273 --> 00:47:22.694]  Here it is.
[00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:31.560]  Did you hear a buzzword or a dog whistle in his repeated use of that?
[00:47:31.560 --> 00:47:32.500]  Back it up again.
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.961]  They use this consensus garbage.
[00:47:33.961 --> 00:47:52.955]  Well, they have these panels of people with the king of fake news, the god of fake news, the poster boy of fake news, the very essence of fake news, the man caught putting out hundreds of fabricated reports claiming he is a combat vet shot down by rocket-propelled grenade in Iraq, Brian Williams back
[00:47:53.015 --> 00:48:03.143]  Back from under a rock, crawling directly out of Hillary Clinton's rear end, on the kitchen table, telling you having a country is evil!
[00:48:03.143 --> 00:48:08.227]  And then going to these ding-dongs he's got there to act all freaked out about it.
[00:48:08.227 --> 00:48:08.628]  Here it is.
[00:48:11.223 --> 00:48:18.348]  Did you hear a buzzword or a dog whistle in his repeated use of that word?
[00:48:39.622 --> 00:48:45.124]  You know, everybody wants to blame Israel for everything.
[00:48:45.124 --> 00:48:49.845]  But Israel's liberals, conservatives, Christians, Jews, a lot of folks live over there.
[00:48:49.845 --> 00:48:56.587]  The point is, I've been neutral on Israel because it's a politically correct subject that's just fraught with mental illness.
[00:48:56.587 --> 00:49:01.769]  But when Israel got the documents and WikiLeaks that George Soros does plan to overthrow the U.S.
[00:49:01.769 --> 00:49:02.429]  and overthrow Israel,
[00:49:04.338 --> 00:49:05.959]  And actually purge people?
[00:49:05.959 --> 00:49:09.622]  Israel finally went, OK, you're a criminal and OK, you're trying to overthrow the US.
[00:49:09.622 --> 00:49:21.011]  And now we actually have parts of the Israel lobby turning against Hollywood and the leftist lobby and turning against all those crazy self-hating Jews and other people in Hollywood and in D.C.
[00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:27.096]  And there is a civil war really going on inside the Israel lobby to a great extent.
[00:49:27.096 --> 00:49:33.921]  And like the cavalry, here comes Netanyahu over here actually, you know, supporting what Trump's doing.
[00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:38.184]  And that's being done out of self-preservation.
[00:49:38.184 --> 00:49:40.627]  The globalists are going to overthrow everything!
[00:49:40.627 --> 00:49:42.909]  They're coming for everybody!
[00:49:42.909 --> 00:49:50.199]  And they're going to turn loose on us a bunch of Muslims that kill each other and can't live in peace and can't even wipe their asses, okay?
[00:49:50.199 --> 00:49:50.899]  With toilet paper!
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:51.980]  I'm sorry.
[00:49:51.980 --> 00:49:52.461]  It's true.
[00:49:52.461 --> 00:49:53.662]  Excuse me.
[00:49:53.662 --> 00:49:56.523]  I'm not trying to be like this, but I'm really angry right now.
[00:49:56.523 --> 00:50:07.451]  And so, again, all the BS you've heard on the Internet, all the anti-Israel stuff, why do you wonder they try to beat you over the head everywhere from conservative angles and why white supremacists hate me so much and always claim I work for Israel?
[00:50:07.451 --> 00:50:11.093]  It's because they've been funded by Soros and Southern Poverty Law Center.
[00:50:11.093 --> 00:50:13.555]  It's come out to a group.
[00:50:13.555 --> 00:50:17.437]  The white supremacists are there to make nationalists and conservatives look bad.
[00:50:17.437 --> 00:50:21.320]  So there's not a big tent for everybody to come and have a big free world of free
[00:50:23.301 --> 00:50:31.345]  They've been caught red-handed, folks, and that's why they're so upset and don't know what to do now.
[00:50:31.345 --> 00:50:46.534]  Because Jews in America are now waking up to this completely, and that is a powerful lobby and on average a wealthy group of people, and to have that whole group now against the globalists is just absolutely devastating, because they got the documents!
[00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:53.821]  Globalism was a complete... A lot of folks went along with globalism, just thinking it was Kumbaya or, you know, maybe they'd have a piece of the pie.
[00:50:53.821 --> 00:50:54.422]  No.
[00:50:54.422 --> 00:50:58.745]  Nobody gets a piece of the pie but mass death run by people like George Soros.
[00:50:59.941 --> 00:51:03.263]  Hey, Daniel Brinkman, why Numana Storable Foods?

[00:54:10.208 --> 00:54:16.831]  Coming to you live from the ATX, deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:54:16.831 --> 00:54:18.232]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:54:18.232 --> 00:54:21.133]  Infowars.com is the site.
[00:54:21.133 --> 00:54:22.714]  PrisonPlanet.com is the backup.
[00:54:22.714 --> 00:54:25.295]  Newswars.com has a lot of exclusive content.
[00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:27.576]  Please help send that link out to everybody.
[00:54:27.576 --> 00:54:31.338]  The site's getting a lot of traffic, but I want to push it out there to be really, really dominant.
[00:54:31.338 --> 00:54:31.918]  Newswars.com.
[00:54:36.198 --> 00:54:46.823]  We have media matters, George Soros, the Federal Elections Commission, Congress saying it's criminal to link to Russian news.
[00:54:46.823 --> 00:54:53.666]  To even show a speech of Putin on Infowars.com or Drudge is Evil and that we're working for these outside powers.
[00:54:53.666 --> 00:54:58.528]  Even though most of the links we have are to US news and even mainstream news that are our enemies.
[00:54:58.528 --> 00:54:59.609]  We're just showing what they're saying.
[00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:03.842]  But they claim that we're the ones that want to destroy U.S.
[00:55:03.842 --> 00:55:13.809]  sovereignty when Trump's delivering on the stock market, delivering on jobs, delivering on the border, delivering on everything he can, and fighting hard to get the other stuff done.
[00:55:13.809 --> 00:55:14.490]  But then you've got
[00:55:15.828 --> 00:55:28.852]  Brian Williams, the poster man of fake news, on MSNBC, saying it's a dog whistle and that it's racist and that sovereignty's bad and undermines the UN and the EU.
[00:55:28.852 --> 00:55:37.515]  Yeah, big bloated, corrupt, anti-free speech, anti-America, anti-Christian, pro-Islamic criminal organizations!
[00:55:39.272 --> 00:55:43.854]  And they're the ones saying Trump's bad for wanting the country to be strong.
[00:55:43.854 --> 00:55:46.676]  How obvious is it who the traitors are?
[00:55:46.676 --> 00:55:50.117]  And Russia's crime is their sovereign and their Christian.
[00:55:50.117 --> 00:55:53.139]  And they've pulled away from the clutches of the globalists.
[00:55:53.139 --> 00:55:55.000]  And they've successfully repulsed
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.161]  Bolshevik Part 2 with Soros.
[00:55:58.161 --> 00:56:02.382]  And Soros wants the same Bolshevik revolution 100 years later.
[00:56:02.382 --> 00:56:04.122]  They want it this October.
[00:56:04.122 --> 00:56:05.862]  They had it planned with Hillary.
[00:56:05.862 --> 00:56:08.303]  And it's blown up in their stinking faces.
[00:56:08.303 --> 00:56:12.284]  Let's go back to the clip of these absolute globalist operatives.
[00:56:12.284 --> 00:56:15.585]  Enemy soldiers in the Infowar against America.
[00:56:15.585 --> 00:56:16.805]  Liars everyone.
[00:56:16.805 --> 00:56:17.245]  Here they are.
[00:56:17.705 --> 00:56:18.985]  It was just over the top.
[00:56:18.985 --> 00:56:26.007]  It was, you know, it caused me to go back through and count how many times, and so he, he used that word sovereign or sovereignty 21 times.
[00:56:26.007 --> 00:56:27.368]  It was definitely THE word.
[00:56:27.368 --> 00:56:31.369]  I mean, everyone... So what does that mean?
[00:56:31.369 --> 00:56:35.970]  It just means what he was talking about from the beginning, which is America first.
[00:56:35.970 --> 00:56:38.071]  We're gonna, we're gonna go it alone.
[00:56:38.311 --> 00:56:38.971]  Said the N-word again!
[00:56:38.971 --> 00:56:42.892]  Every other nation should be independent and free to do what they want.
[00:56:42.892 --> 00:56:43.313]  Said the S-word!
[00:56:43.313 --> 00:56:48.994]  And get together to fight, you know, what he called the wicked, the wicked few, I think he called it, the wicked ones.
[00:56:48.994 --> 00:56:49.915]  Yeah, like ISIS, yeah, yeah.
[00:56:49.915 --> 00:56:59.477]  So, you know, that really undermines, to me, the UN, which is where he was today, NATO, EU, places like that, international bodies, he was really saying.
[00:56:59.477 --> 00:57:00.918]  Shut up by the globals, that's enough for her.
[00:57:02.304 --> 00:57:08.126]  We know who the enemies are, and we're sick of you, and Hollywood's imploding, mainstream media's imploding.
[00:57:08.126 --> 00:57:11.467]  Everyone who has any brain cells hates you.
[00:57:11.467 --> 00:57:13.408]  In fact, most of your viewers know you're a fraud.
[00:57:13.408 --> 00:57:16.349]  They want to be you, and want to be con artists.
[00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:24.452]  So they watch you like you're their mommy, and they're under your black wings, and they suck off your poisonous appendages.
[00:57:25.560 --> 00:57:39.868]  Now before I go any further, we need funding, and when we offer stuff at 50% off, like we're doing the highest quality My Patriot Supply, privately owned by Infowars, with promo code READY, it's 50% off the already super low price.
[00:57:39.868 --> 00:57:42.169]  Now all their other distributors only do like 20%.
[00:57:42.169 --> 00:57:44.691]  I twist arms in a savage way.
[00:57:45.211 --> 00:57:50.197]  And they just said, OK, fine, because the earthquakes and everything else, we're not going to be like Amazon.
[00:57:50.197 --> 00:57:52.960]  People are really waking up while supplies last.
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:59.026]  They ship usually same day the order goes through, but it could get behind the next few weeks because the massive amount of orders.
[00:57:59.026 --> 00:58:02.290]  But we're not raising prices when people are massively ordering.
[00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:03.031]  We cut them!
[00:58:03.371 --> 00:58:04.352]  Yeah!
[00:58:04.352 --> 00:58:05.773]  Because that's how I want to be treated.
[00:58:05.773 --> 00:58:07.375]  I want all the good mojo.
[00:58:07.375 --> 00:58:08.796]  I want to reap what I sow.
[00:58:08.796 --> 00:58:10.477]  I treat you like I want to be treated.
[00:58:10.477 --> 00:58:12.999]  But we got to sell a lot of this to make any money.
[00:58:12.999 --> 00:58:16.742]  Because we're making like 5-6% depending on the package of food on this.

[00:58:43.429 --> 00:58:45.312]  I smell their fear!
[00:58:45.312 --> 00:58:45.392]  Ha!
[00:58:50.669 --> 00:58:56.792]  After being sold out for months, our best-selling super blue fluoride toothpaste is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:56.792 --> 00:58:58.873]  Research across the board is clear.
[00:58:58.873 --> 00:59:04.176]  When bacteria infects your gums, it can enter your bloodstream and even contribute to blood clots and heart attacks.
[00:59:04.176 --> 00:59:07.918]  That's why the last Surgeon General's report on oral health warns that
[00:59:08.018 --> 00:59:11.461]  Your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[00:59:11.461 --> 00:59:14.664]  Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula.
[00:59:14.664 --> 00:59:18.528]  It's loaded with good halogen iodine instead of the bad halogen fluoride.
[00:59:18.528 --> 00:59:25.715]  Super Blue contains natural oils and ingredients used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath.
[00:59:25.715 --> 00:59:31.100]  Just some of the ingredients in Super Blue chosen by our dental experts include xylitol, peppermint oil,
[00:59:31.360 --> 00:59:33.541]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:09.166]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:13.389]  I'm an average man with an average life.
[01:00:13.389 --> 01:00:16.952]  I work for 95, hell, I pay the price.
[01:00:26.966 --> 01:00:41.877]  Darren McBrain put out a meme on Real Alex Jones yesterday that a lot of folks retweeted that shows what the average trendy looks like when you go out to one of these anti-Trump or just pro-Democrat rallies.
[01:00:41.877 --> 01:00:44.118]  White men are terrorists.
[01:00:44.118 --> 01:00:47.080]  And then you can't tell if the person's male or female.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.081]  I'm not making fun of them.
[01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:50.703]  This is what they've done to us in this culture.
[01:00:50.703 --> 01:00:54.446]  What kind of man do you trust with the future of the United States?
[01:00:55.410 --> 01:01:04.047]  This man, or woman, or person, or this fella right over here.
[01:01:04.047 --> 01:01:06.912]  And that's really what this comes down to, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:07.964 --> 01:01:36.303]  Rubber meets the road, communism and socialism is what wicked control freaks want and super rich billionaires that own slave factories all over the world and are horribly evil and are helping communist China, Iran and Pakistan round up political dissenters that even mildly criticize the policies and imprison or kill them!
[01:01:36.303 --> 01:01:37.484]  And it just goes on
[01:01:39.002 --> 01:01:42.725]  And on and on.
[01:01:42.725 --> 01:01:54.574]  Now if we continue, ladies and gentlemen, looking at the social engineering, we have to be honest with ourselves about where this is all going.
[01:01:54.574 --> 01:02:01.979]  And where it's all going is an attempt to start a civil war in this country.
[01:02:01.979 --> 01:02:02.700]  And I'm going to go to break.
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:03.681]  This is a short segment.
[01:02:04.875 --> 01:02:06.596]  And I'm going to come back and look at the health care battle.
[01:02:06.596 --> 01:02:13.901]  I'm going to come back and look at the meltdown of Lawrence O'Donnell that is truly unhinged and cringeworthy.
[01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:23.788]  And we're also going to look at Jimmy Kimmel threatens to assault Fox News host, which again, goes towards all this hyping up of violence.
[01:02:23.788 --> 01:02:25.069]  We've got a report.
[01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:28.091]  It's from yesterday, but I want to air it so I can get to it on Morgan Freedman.
[01:02:28.091 --> 01:02:30.673]  We're at war with Russia by Paul Watson.
[01:02:30.673 --> 01:02:33.815]  We have CNN finally admitting the truth by Mark Dice.
[01:02:35.336 --> 01:03:01.899]  which uh... is is is powerful there's another one proof gay frogs are real uh... do took clips of me talking about it and then interspersed with news articles and and and pbs documentaries admitting that the majority of the frogs uh... in most areas in the united states are now gay and it it actually uh... shows what's happening and uh... they they don't choose females
[01:03:03.783 --> 01:03:10.345]  They go over to the male, and then they go and they live together.
[01:03:10.345 --> 01:03:17.587]  And then you read Brave New World, written 1933-32, he says that's the plan.
[01:03:17.587 --> 01:03:20.448]  It has nothing to do whether you love gay people or hate them.
[01:03:20.448 --> 01:03:25.670]  They're putting chemicals in the food and water where you look at men and women, you can't tell what's what most of the time now.
[01:03:28.547 --> 01:03:34.950]  And then you take things like serotonin reuptake inhibitors, they increase the chance of early death 33%.
[01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:36.630]  And that's even mainstream news.
[01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:38.751]  And you know what they're doing?
[01:03:38.751 --> 01:03:48.795]  I asked a question, why is ABC News and NBC News and CNN and the BBC suddenly going, you know it's true, atrazine is changing your sex.
[01:03:48.795 --> 01:03:52.797]  And you know it's true, fluoride does lower your IQ 15 points on average.
[01:03:52.797 --> 01:03:54.697]  And you know it's true, it does deform your baby.
[01:03:54.697 --> 01:03:55.698]  And you know it's true,
[01:03:57.729 --> 01:04:02.113]  33% acceleration or increase in early death with Prozac-type drugs.
[01:04:02.113 --> 01:04:04.574]  That's Luvox, all of them.
[01:04:04.574 --> 01:04:20.726]  They gotta tell you, because they know it's going to get so bad now that when half your family's dying, you know, it's so liberal, and the life expectancy is plunging, and infant mortality is skyrocketing, and pediatric cancers are up 10,000%.
[01:04:20.726 --> 01:04:22.868]  I'm not saying all this to be negative.
[01:04:24.721 --> 01:04:27.906]  If I wake up and the house is on fire, I'm going to go, hey everybody, let's get out of the house.
[01:04:27.906 --> 01:04:31.952]  Or try to put the fire extinguisher if we can, but you know, you kids and everybody get outside.
[01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:32.974]  That's not being negative.
[01:04:32.974 --> 01:04:33.915]  The house is on fire.
[01:04:33.915 --> 01:04:34.657]  We're getting out of here.
[01:04:37.779 --> 01:04:42.424]  And the globalists have made the decision to not try to fix civilization, to not try to make it better.
[01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:54.896]  They've decided to ride this collapse down using a global consolidation of control while everything collapses, extruding all that energy and everything to build their new escaped civilization.
[01:04:54.896 --> 01:04:55.457]  That's what's happened.
[01:04:57.372 --> 01:05:04.353]  James Madison, the father of the Bill of Rights, wrote, Where an excess of power prevails, property of no sort is duly respected.
[01:05:04.353 --> 01:05:09.834]  No man is safe in his opinions, in his person, in his faculties, or in his possessions.
[01:05:09.834 --> 01:05:13.175]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:15.536]  The only question is, how do we contain it?
[01:05:15.536 --> 01:05:20.877]  And how do we remove that power from Washington, to our local communities, to the individual?
[01:05:20.877 --> 01:05:22.457]  That is the ultimate concern.
[01:05:22.717 --> 01:05:28.943]  The concentration of power, the excess of power, was always the chief concern of the founders of this country.
[01:05:28.943 --> 01:05:31.385]  It was why the Anti-Federalists opposed the Constitution.
[01:05:31.385 --> 01:05:35.669]  They believed they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power.
[01:05:35.669 --> 01:05:39.993]  But as James Madison also pointed out, knowledge will forever govern ignorance.
[01:05:40.413 --> 01:05:45.796]  People who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives.
[01:05:45.796 --> 01:05:51.158]  Arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing, of what the real constraints upon them are.
[01:05:51.158 --> 01:05:54.660]  Only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions.
[01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.721]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:05:57.341 --> 01:06:07.945]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body.

[01:06:17.728 --> 01:06:18.149]  Absolutely.

[01:07:26.152 --> 01:07:26.352]  Woo!
[01:07:26.352 --> 01:07:27.393]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:07:27.393 --> 01:07:36.139]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation, like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store, there is no comparison.
[01:07:36.139 --> 01:07:45.726]  Harvest Right freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color, and nutritional value, and have a shelf life of up to 25 years.

[01:08:00.394 --> 01:08:02.054]  And that's what you should want!
[01:08:02.054 --> 01:08:05.155]  You don't stand up for the Constitution, you stand for zip, not a zero.
[01:08:05.155 --> 01:08:08.596]  Sir, do you remember the First Amendment?
[01:08:08.596 --> 01:08:11.557]  I said that I didn't want us in the war.
[01:08:11.557 --> 01:08:15.238]  Talk about clinch-shifting Russian military armaments right now.
[01:08:15.238 --> 01:08:18.339]  I think we have to resist at every level.
[01:08:18.339 --> 01:08:19.540]  America first!
[01:08:19.540 --> 01:08:20.580]  You heard that before?
[01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:23.821]  Those of us that are in the faction, we're the enemy.
[01:08:23.821 --> 01:08:27.282]  All we want you to do is wait for yourself to be baptized.
[01:08:28.635 --> 01:08:30.738]  Alex Jones isn't going away.
[01:08:30.738 --> 01:08:37.107]  The New World Order didn't come and it's here.
[01:08:37.107 --> 01:08:39.290]  The price of liberty and freedom is eternal vigilance.
[01:08:44.343 --> 01:08:45.524]  More people wake up.
[01:08:45.524 --> 01:08:48.086]  Every passing day, your tyranny bleeds to death.
[01:08:48.086 --> 01:08:52.129]  I'm standing up against those who destroy this country as we speak!
[01:08:52.129 --> 01:08:55.572]  I just want to finish by saying your reputation's amazing.
[01:08:55.572 --> 01:08:57.073]  I will not let you down.
[01:08:57.073 --> 01:09:04.159]  You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:09:04.159 --> 01:09:05.920]  We're live, broadcasting worldwide.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:10.684]  This is Patriots Worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[01:09:10.684 --> 01:09:12.365]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:09:14.161 --> 01:09:15.763]  I'll play the clip in just a moment.
[01:09:15.763 --> 01:09:23.010]  CNN's Chief Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin has surprisingly admitted the truth about the Trump-Russia conspiracy investigation.
[01:09:23.010 --> 01:09:24.691]  Well, I guess half of the truth.
[01:09:24.691 --> 01:09:28.875]  Which, considering this is CNN, just anything truthful is surprising.
[01:09:28.875 --> 01:09:34.581]  But let's listen to what he's saying here, and then when he's done, I will, as Paul Harvey used to say, tell you the rest of the story.
[01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:36.161]  Not jump too far yet.
[01:09:36.161 --> 01:09:46.605]  Just to add one point that I think we sometimes miss is collusion is a word we throw around a lot about this investigation.
[01:09:46.605 --> 01:09:51.386]  Was the government of Russia colluding with the Trump campaign?
[01:09:51.386 --> 01:09:54.927]  There is no federal crime called collusion.
[01:09:54.927 --> 01:09:56.848]  It's not even clear that it's illegal.
[01:09:57.368 --> 01:09:57.708]  I think?
[01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:25.603]  I can't even believe that he just admitted that, which is what normal people have been saying for months, including liberal Alan Dershowitz, who is a Harvard Law professor.
[01:10:25.603 --> 01:10:31.790]  Maybe Jeffrey Toobin has finally decided to be a lawyer again, instead of just an anti-Trump kook CNN contributor.
[01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:34.151]  Like I said, he's only admitted half of the truth.
[01:10:34.151 --> 01:10:42.695]  The real heart of the matter is, if collusion isn't the crime, which it's not, and of course there wasn't any collusion, then why are they even having this investigation to begin with?
[01:10:42.695 --> 01:10:57.923]  The answer is that this investigation was an excuse for what's called investigatory creep, where they use the excuse of investigating this Trump-Russia collusion, which again isn't even a crime, even if it did happen, to then try to find other unrelated possible crimes.
[01:10:58.343 --> 01:11:09.896]  And it looks like what may happen here is that President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, may be indicted for not crossing a T or dotting an I on some tax forms from a decade ago.
[01:11:09.896 --> 01:11:18.826]  Then they're going to use that indictment to try to get a plea deal to try to get him to roll over and give some dirt on Donald Trump or just make up something in order to get a reduced sentence.
[01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:32.934]  Oh, and by the way, Paul Manafort was wiretapped before, during, and after the election, after a secret FISA warrant was issued, but former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that nobody in the Trump campaign was wiretapped.
[01:11:32.934 --> 01:11:36.056]  If something like that happened, would this be something you would be aware of?
[01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:39.798]  I would certainly hope so.
[01:11:39.798 --> 01:11:58.212]  Obviously, I can't speak officially anymore, but I will say that for the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI, there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the President-elect at the time, as a candidate, or against his campaign.
[01:11:59.352 --> 01:12:07.295]  I can't speak for other Title III authorized entities in the government or a state or local entity.
[01:12:07.295 --> 01:12:14.258]  I was just going to say, if the FBI, for instance, had a FISA court order of some sort for a surveillance, would that be information you would know or not know?
[01:12:14.258 --> 01:12:14.978]  Yes.
[01:12:14.978 --> 01:12:16.119]  You would be told this?
[01:12:16.119 --> 01:12:16.839]  I would know that.
[01:12:16.839 --> 01:12:19.980]  If there was a FISA court order on something like this.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.361]  Something like this, absolutely.
[01:12:21.361 --> 01:12:23.722]  And at this point, you can't confirm or deny whether that exists?
[01:12:28.039 --> 01:12:29.299]  Not to my knowledge.
[01:12:29.299 --> 01:12:30.861]  Anything at Trump Tower?
[01:12:30.861 --> 01:12:31.681]  No.
[01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.903]  Oh, by the way, guess where Paul Manafort lives?
[01:12:33.903 --> 01:12:35.784]  He lives in Trump Tower!
[01:12:35.784 --> 01:12:37.325]  He's got an apartment there!
[01:12:37.325 --> 01:12:42.669]  This, of course, is just one of the millions of reasons we call NBC nothing but crap and total fake news.
[01:12:42.669 --> 01:12:44.391]  I'm Mark Dice, thanks for watching.
[01:12:44.391 --> 01:12:47.273]  All right, Mark is coming on with us at the start of the next hour.
[01:12:47.273 --> 01:12:52.837]  I plan to open the phones up coming up at the bottom of this hour, and we'll have open phones with Mark as well for the full hour.
[01:12:56.733 --> 01:12:59.816]  Mark reaches millions of people a day.
[01:12:59.816 --> 01:13:03.378]  He's been doing this for about 12, 13 years.
[01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:09.183]  He's written a bunch of books, you name it, but only the last five years or so has he really started hitting a lot of people.
[01:13:09.183 --> 01:13:11.405]  He reached millions before, but now it's millions a day.
[01:13:11.405 --> 01:13:19.051]  That is so exciting to me, to see him grow, to see his common sense just really shine.
[01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:21.232]  And all he's doing is pointing out what liars they are.
[01:13:21.232 --> 01:13:22.894]  Now that video was from yesterday.
[01:13:24.645 --> 01:13:30.850]  Now we've got something to add to this engine, the caboose.
[01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:36.595]  They admit that they've had Trump and Trump Tower and Manafort spied on.
[01:13:36.595 --> 01:13:41.519]  And Comey's lied and Clapper's lied and Clapper's lied before and said there's no spying inside the US.
[01:13:41.519 --> 01:13:43.000]  We played that clip yesterday.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:49.585]  But now Clapper has come out and saying he could have been.
[01:13:49.585 --> 01:13:54.109]  So they're kind of letting this stinky thing out real slow and quiet.
[01:13:55.575 --> 01:13:57.675]  So that nobody knows where it came from.
[01:13:57.675 --> 01:14:02.916]  Kind of like everybody's sitting there in church and nobody knows where the flatulence came from.
[01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:06.077]  But Clapper's been denying any of this is going on.
[01:14:06.077 --> 01:14:12.258]  Now he knows they're getting caught, so he's just kind of like, let me kind of let this slip out so nobody knows who did it.
[01:14:12.258 --> 01:14:17.119]  And I hate to use gross analogies, but that's the analogy here.
[01:14:17.119 --> 01:14:19.620]  Clapper crapped all over the floor.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:21.120]  Obama crapped all over the floor.
[01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:24.780]  Hillary was just rubbing it all over her faces.
[01:14:24.780 --> 01:14:30.108]  They were on television during the campaign, and when the president was president-elect, saying...
[01:14:32.455 --> 01:14:35.818]  That they were wiretapping him, that's why they knew they were Russians.
[01:14:35.818 --> 01:14:37.078]  But then there's nothing really there.
[01:14:37.078 --> 01:14:39.320]  They just wanted to put that out to sound credible.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.881]  Trump points out that's illegal.
[01:14:40.881 --> 01:14:43.663]  Trump points out it's illegal to leak the information.
[01:14:43.663 --> 01:14:52.330]  So they all then perjure themselves to Congress and say they didn't, but now Trump's the president, just like Conway said a few months ago.
[01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:54.932]  They're like, how do you know Trump was spot on?
[01:14:54.932 --> 01:14:56.273]  She goes, he's the president now.
[01:14:57.711 --> 01:14:59.012]  And he's gotten access to it.
[01:14:59.012 --> 01:14:59.792]  Now I can't get into it.
[01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:00.373]  It's classified.
[01:15:00.373 --> 01:15:02.514]  They went, oh, sure.
[01:15:02.514 --> 01:15:04.755]  Sure you do, toots.
[01:15:04.755 --> 01:15:10.879]  Well, we don't need the fact that they admitted it previously, because they're such liars.
[01:15:10.879 --> 01:15:11.680]  Who knows?
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:16.423]  It's now in the documents, and they've now been forced to admit it galactic level.
[01:15:18.356 --> 01:15:20.157]  Galactic level fall on their face.
[01:15:20.157 --> 01:15:29.881]  Not just because they've been proven to be congenital liars again, with all the late night comics, reading off teleprompters, and you know, all the rest of their garbage.
[01:15:29.881 --> 01:15:36.904]  But it's illegal what they did, both leaking it, and the way they did it for political purposes.
[01:15:36.904 --> 01:15:38.225]  It's incredible.
[01:15:38.225 --> 01:15:43.767]  And now they say, we're going after Manafort for 10-year-old tax returns.
[01:15:43.767 --> 01:15:46.528]  Not that you didn't pay the money.
[01:15:46.528 --> 01:15:47.769]  This is directly from Manafort's lawyers.
[01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:55.786]  But, that he didn't fill out a federal form on time, his CPA did it a year later.
[01:15:55.786 --> 01:16:03.729]  And I can't tell you, we got CPAs, you name it, but how many times you get a call from the CPA, oh we forgot to file this, come do this.
[01:16:03.729 --> 01:16:08.931]  Nobody's ever gone to jail for that, but that's all they've got!
[01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:14.574]  SWAT team raids, pointing machine guns at him and his family, to try to intimidate him.
[01:16:14.574 --> 01:16:16.915]  What a group of lawless scum!
[01:16:18.911 --> 01:16:26.119]  And Mueller is the Lord High Chancellor, and he would be the Lord High Executioner over America.
[01:16:26.119 --> 01:16:36.191]  He covered up the Clinton crimes, he covered up the Bush garbage and the globalists, and took Islamists off the terror watch list, where you couldn't even have an investigation of Muslims, period.
[01:16:36.191 --> 01:16:39.475]  I mean, you look at Mueller, he is a disgraceful person.
[01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:45.997]  But what's even more disgraceful is them holding him up like he's this holy man.
[01:16:45.997 --> 01:16:53.959]  Just like that degenerate pedophile Pope and his deputy Pope caught kidnapping 100 kids and buggering them.
[01:16:53.959 --> 01:16:55.240]  It's the same thing.
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:01.282]  It's just a rotten nest of sick freaks who wear suits and ties.
[01:17:01.282 --> 01:17:04.823]  Well, so did Ted Bundy and so did John Wayne Gacy.
[01:17:07.802 --> 01:17:12.706]  So, here's the rest of the story, backing up what Dice was just saying.
[01:17:12.706 --> 01:17:17.829]  It's like backing up, again, the sky's blue, or the sun's yellow, or birds fly in the air.
[01:17:17.829 --> 01:17:20.791]  As you can argue, some don't like ostriches.
[01:17:20.791 --> 01:17:22.893]  The point is, is that this is now out.
[01:17:23.823 --> 01:17:25.063]  And it's big.
[01:17:25.063 --> 01:17:29.084]  And this is what we've been behind the scenes hammering Trump with.
[01:17:29.084 --> 01:17:37.546]  Because this is how he can take out all these unconstitutional enemies, all these traitors, all these liars, all these people that have done what they say he's done.
[01:17:37.546 --> 01:17:43.448]  They're the ones selling us out to the Communist Chinese, and to Saudi Arabia, and to the EU, and to Russia.
[01:17:44.665 --> 01:17:52.029]  All of them are up to their eyeballs in Russian collusion, including Clapper, and Brennan, and Islamic collusion.
[01:17:52.029 --> 01:17:54.471]  And that's why they're pointing and going, he's a Russian!
[01:17:54.471 --> 01:17:55.871]  He's a Russian!
[01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:59.954]  Because that's the least group involved.
[01:17:59.954 --> 01:18:06.597]  They don't want to blame all their friends, all their buddies, in the CHICOM operation, so they blame their joint enemy, the Russians.
[01:18:06.597 --> 01:18:07.738]  Let's go to the clip.
[01:18:08.539 --> 01:18:16.047]  I say that the fact that Manafort was wiretapped proves that the president was right to accuse the former president of wiretapping him and you were wrong.
[01:18:16.047 --> 01:18:16.808]  What's your response?
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:24.284]  Well, again, I stand on that statement that you just replayed.
[01:18:24.284 --> 01:18:38.693]  And I cannot comment on the media reporting, which is all we have, about a FISA warrant allegedly lodged against Mr. Manafort.
[01:18:38.693 --> 01:18:40.214]  I can't comment on that.
[01:18:40.214 --> 01:18:45.538]  I will simply reiterate what I said in March, and I stand on that.
[01:18:46.338 --> 01:18:52.546]  Yeah, and that there is as far as Trump Tower being wiretapped according to the president.
[01:18:53.883 --> 01:18:56.025]  You're, you say what?
[01:18:56.025 --> 01:19:01.330]  I stand on what I said on the 5th of March on Meet the Press as you just replayed it.
[01:19:01.330 --> 01:19:01.850]  Okay.
[01:19:01.850 --> 01:19:06.214]  So did you know, and I hate to keep, I just want to, just for clarity, because there's been a lot of reporting on this, right?
[01:19:06.214 --> 01:19:11.859]  And people on, on, on, you know, especially those supporters of the President saying, oh, here's proof, here's proof.
[01:19:11.859 --> 01:19:15.762]  So did, did you know about a FISA warrant against Paul Manafort at the time?
[01:19:15.762 --> 01:19:16.863]  I did not.
[01:19:16.863 --> 01:19:17.784]  You did not.
[01:19:17.784 --> 01:19:18.144]  Okay.
[01:19:18.144 --> 01:19:19.846]  And I, and I, again, I have to say...
[01:19:23.206 --> 01:19:30.909]  Is it possible the president was picked up in a conversation with Paul Manafort?
[01:19:30.909 --> 01:19:31.369]  Is it likely?
[01:19:51.032 --> 01:19:52.392]  Uh, I can't say.
[01:19:52.392 --> 01:19:57.114]  So now they're trying to let it out without being involved in perjury.
[01:19:57.114 --> 01:19:59.074]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[01:19:59.074 --> 01:20:05.976]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[01:20:05.976 --> 01:20:14.318]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[01:20:14.318 --> 01:20:19.999]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[01:20:20.179 --> 01:20:22.021]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[01:20:22.021 --> 01:20:24.182]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[01:20:24.182 --> 01:20:28.686]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[01:20:28.686 --> 01:20:30.868]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[01:20:30.868 --> 01:20:38.935]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.
[01:20:39.295 --> 01:20:39.736]  We're good to go.

[01:24:06.932 --> 01:24:22.142]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live, and Adon Salazar, I was just refreshing InfoWars.com, and I noticed Adon Salazar's article, and right as I was reading it, he walks in and he goes, Boss, you missed the whole point in your Matt Drudge rant last hour.
[01:24:23.001 --> 01:24:38.212]  So I guess I've got to amend it, because I was only clicking on the top link that was a link to Media Matters, making the joke that Media Matters, run by George Soros and David Brock, says that if Matt Drudge ever links to any Russian news, he works for the Russians.
[01:24:38.212 --> 01:24:51.502]  But then I didn't even notice that the links under it are links to Interfax, ITAR-TAS and Pravda, which again are connected very, very closely to the Russian news agency.
[01:24:52.557 --> 01:24:54.258]  You can go ahead and scroll down, there it is right there.
[01:24:54.258 --> 01:25:01.202]  Or just go right to DrugsReport.com and I can show TV viewers what I'm talking about that way.
[01:25:01.202 --> 01:25:11.509]  But that's the craziness of them trying to tell him, we want criminal investigations of you, which is what the Democrats have called for, because you link to Russia.
[01:25:11.509 --> 01:25:14.911]  I mean, are we in a free country or not?
[01:25:14.911 --> 01:25:18.593]  And quite frankly, a lot of the stuff I link to out of RT is leftist.
[01:25:18.593 --> 01:25:19.174]  I don't like it.
[01:25:20.674 --> 01:25:35.401]  Because everybody wants to prove to the globalists they're nice and it's all this pro-government reporting a lot of times like trying to... I know for a fact behind the scenes they've threatened to pull the RT license and threatened RT years ago not to have me on.
[01:25:35.401 --> 01:25:38.023]  RT doesn't have that big an audience in the US.
[01:25:38.023 --> 01:25:39.804]  Most of the time I won't even go on with RT or...
[01:25:41.010 --> 01:25:42.090]  British television.
[01:25:42.090 --> 01:25:44.471]  I refuse BBC all the time.
[01:25:44.471 --> 01:25:46.511]  Japanese, Iranian television.
[01:25:46.511 --> 01:25:47.631]  I just don't have time to do it.
[01:25:47.631 --> 01:25:48.771]  They had me doing it every day.
[01:25:48.771 --> 01:25:51.552]  But I don't work for the Brazilians.
[01:25:51.552 --> 01:25:52.792]  I don't work for the Japanese.
[01:25:52.792 --> 01:25:53.712]  I don't work for the Russians.
[01:25:53.712 --> 01:25:55.533]  But I tell you this.
[01:25:55.533 --> 01:25:58.133]  I'm not a guy that pulls stunts.
[01:25:58.133 --> 01:26:00.474]  But I do want to see Israel.
[01:26:00.474 --> 01:26:03.734]  And I do want to see Russia.
[01:26:03.734 --> 01:26:07.495]  And I think I'm going to plan a trip very, very soon.
[01:26:07.495 --> 01:26:08.355]  A two-week trip.
[01:26:09.906 --> 01:26:13.328]  Where I'm going to go for a week to Israel, because everybody says I work for Israel.
[01:26:13.328 --> 01:26:17.111]  And I've been very, very fair on both sides of the issue.
[01:26:17.111 --> 01:26:18.572]  And they also say I work for Russia.
[01:26:18.572 --> 01:26:20.933]  And it's just, it's a canard.
[01:26:20.933 --> 01:26:26.938]  But I guess losers out there can't believe somebody else is successful on their own.
[01:26:26.938 --> 01:26:28.278]  Well, our audience knows that.
[01:26:28.278 --> 01:26:31.260]  And that's why we are successful.
[01:26:31.260 --> 01:26:31.981]  They support us.
[01:26:31.981 --> 01:26:32.902]  They spread the word.
[01:26:32.902 --> 01:26:34.002]  They see through the propaganda.
[01:26:34.002 --> 01:26:34.783]  But man, I tell you.
[01:26:36.027 --> 01:26:40.751]  It is insulting to hear that we get our money or our information from the Russians.
[01:26:40.751 --> 01:26:44.274]  Hillary finally started getting this right the last few months.
[01:26:44.274 --> 01:26:47.017]  She stopped saying that we get it from the Russians.
[01:26:47.017 --> 01:26:49.739]  Now she says they get it from me.
[01:26:49.739 --> 01:26:51.601]  And now you're telling the truth, lady.
[01:26:51.601 --> 01:26:54.924]  And I'm not bragging, but let's just, let's get down to brass tacks.
[01:26:54.924 --> 01:27:00.929]  The entire America reboot was our audience and our guest and the Infowars operation
[01:27:02.051 --> 01:27:06.254]  Promoting Americana and comparing it to globalism and saying, which do you want?
[01:27:06.254 --> 01:27:08.176]  That's the big choice.
[01:27:08.176 --> 01:27:11.398]  I've been hammering that for 20 years.
[01:27:11.398 --> 01:27:12.779]  I didn't invent Americana.
[01:27:12.779 --> 01:27:15.161]  I just said, man, it's a lot sexier.
[01:27:15.161 --> 01:27:23.648]  57 Chevys and Marilyn Monroe and freedom and religious freedom and travel wherever you want and have low taxes and just prosperity, baby.
[01:27:23.648 --> 01:27:26.950]  That's a lot better than collectivism.
[01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:28.932]  So we rebooted Americana.
[01:27:30.481 --> 01:27:32.144]  And you did it as an audience.
[01:27:32.144 --> 01:27:35.089]  That's why I'm hated, because they know it's you.
[01:27:35.089 --> 01:27:39.076]  And we're just a focal point here at InfoWars.
[01:27:39.076 --> 01:27:44.124]  But we really should celebrate the fact that, yes, all over the world, from Japan,
[01:27:45.854 --> 01:27:55.519]  To Russia, to Europe, to the UK, to Mexico, to Brazil, to South Africa, all over the world, they're huge listeners of InfoWars.
[01:27:55.519 --> 01:28:01.462]  Max Keiser, working for RT, also for Al Jazeera, doesn't mean he works for the Arabs either, and he's worked for the BBC.
[01:28:01.462 --> 01:28:08.666]  He's been all over the world, from Asia, to Latin America, to the Middle East, and he says they all run over.
[01:28:08.666 --> 01:28:09.527]  The number one thing.
[01:28:10.707 --> 01:28:12.368]  We love Alex Jones.
[01:28:12.368 --> 01:28:14.069]  We want to meet Alex Jones.
[01:28:14.069 --> 01:28:14.830]  We love Alex Jones.
[01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:18.052]  I even have Muslims in shopping malls come over and shake my hand.
[01:28:18.052 --> 01:28:23.255]  And I realize most Muslims actually don't want to be under orthodox, suppressive Wahhabism.
[01:28:23.255 --> 01:28:25.516]  They actually want to come here and not be bullied.
[01:28:25.516 --> 01:28:26.597]  They're not all bad.
[01:28:26.597 --> 01:28:29.919]  But the religious ones that actually believe it, they're dangerous.
[01:28:29.919 --> 01:28:31.480]  They believe they've got to take over and dominate.
[01:28:32.711 --> 01:28:34.732]  And I used to try the whole carrot approach with Islam.
[01:28:34.732 --> 01:28:35.673]  Everybody knows that.
[01:28:35.673 --> 01:28:37.274]  I used to get accused of working for Muslims.
[01:28:37.274 --> 01:28:38.094]  Remember all that?
[01:28:38.094 --> 01:28:38.594]  Ten years ago?
[01:28:38.594 --> 01:28:40.015]  Because I didn't want to blow up the whole Middle East.
[01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:42.877]  I knew it was part of a clash of civilizations.
[01:28:42.877 --> 01:28:49.100]  I read the white papers, where it was meant to actually kick out the non-radicals, put the radicals in, and then flood Europe.
[01:28:49.100 --> 01:28:52.802]  I wanted to stop the globalist program.
[01:28:52.802 --> 01:28:55.644]  So again, I don't get
[01:28:57.113 --> 01:28:58.854]  My information from Russia.
[01:28:58.854 --> 01:29:01.014]  Russia gets their information from me.
[01:29:01.014 --> 01:29:01.915]  And I'm not bragging.
[01:29:01.915 --> 01:29:02.815]  It's a fact.
[01:29:02.815 --> 01:29:03.915]  They love Americana.
[01:29:03.915 --> 01:29:05.136]  They want to be free.
[01:29:05.136 --> 01:29:07.697]  They understand we sent the Bolsheviks over there.
[01:29:07.697 --> 01:29:10.577]  It isn't that they actually follow everything I say.
[01:29:10.577 --> 01:29:17.900]  They just already know what I'm saying is true and it causes basically an affirmation to happen and for people to have solidarity.
[01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:24.241]  But, I mean, we've had top Putin advisors on talking about how InfoWars has changed Russia.
[01:29:24.241 --> 01:29:26.083]  InfoWars has changed their view.
[01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:27.825]  InfoWars has helped give them the big picture.
[01:29:27.825 --> 01:29:29.206]  They've helped give us the big picture.
[01:29:29.206 --> 01:29:31.108]  And all of us together, the UK.
[01:29:31.108 --> 01:29:37.473]  Nigel Farage has said on this show three times that UKIP exploded after InfoWars went into the UK.
[01:29:37.473 --> 01:29:38.434]  It's a fact.
[01:29:38.434 --> 01:29:40.997]  We're winning the war because of you, the listeners.
[01:29:45.829 --> 01:29:48.832]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:29:48.832 --> 01:29:52.436]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:58.135 --> 01:30:03.000]  Joe Biggs here with Infowars.com with some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:11.728]  The most basic principle to being a free American is the notion that we as individuals are responsible for our own lives and decisions.
[01:30:11.728 --> 01:30:15.932]  We do not have the right to rob our neighbors to make up for our own mistakes.
[01:30:16.132 --> 01:30:22.376]  Neither does our neighbor have any right to tell us how to live, so long as we aren't infringing on their rights.
[01:30:22.376 --> 01:30:26.939]  Freedom to make bad decisions is inherent in the freedom to make good ones.
[01:30:26.939 --> 01:30:30.961]  If we are only free to make good decisions, then we are not really free.
[01:30:30.961 --> 01:30:38.046]  Liberty is lost through complacency and a subservient mindset when we accept or even welcome automobile checkpoints.
[01:30:38.246 --> 01:30:44.373]  Random searches, mandatory identification cards, and paramilitary police in our streets.
[01:30:44.373 --> 01:30:47.497]  We have lost a vital part of our American heritage.
[01:30:47.497 --> 01:30:52.143]  America was born of protests, revolution, and mistrust of government.
[01:30:52.143 --> 01:30:56.148]  Subservient societies neither maintain nor deserve freedom for long.
[01:30:58.843 --> 01:31:03.546]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[01:31:58.314 --> 01:32:03.036]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[01:32:03.036 --> 01:32:16.100]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[01:32:16.100 --> 01:32:22.742]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[01:32:22.742 --> 01:32:26.183]  And so I set out to develop caveman, but to not just have
[01:32:26.403 --> 01:32:36.733]  Concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[01:32:36.733 --> 01:32:46.922]  InfoWars isn't just fighting the globalists, we're getting results and we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[01:32:46.922 --> 01:32:49.004]  Caveman is back in stock, people.
[01:32:49.204 --> 01:32:50.145]  Absolutely love it.
[01:32:50.145 --> 01:33:00.593]  So please, secure your caveman today at Infowarslife.com or by calling toll-free, AAA253-3139.
[01:33:00.593 --> 01:33:07.178]  You are listening to an Infowars.com Frontline Report.
[01:33:07.178 --> 01:33:11.081]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:18.672 --> 01:33:27.199]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:34.392 --> 01:33:45.338]  Russian heavy bombers turned back a final last-ditch al-Qaeda-ISIS offensive as thousands of fighters attempted to exit the town they were held in and retake the nearby city.
[01:33:45.338 --> 01:33:46.979]  I'm going to be getting into that.
[01:33:46.979 --> 01:33:48.139]  Larry Nichols is joining us.
[01:33:48.139 --> 01:33:54.323]  I intend to open the phones up as well throughout this hour into the next when Mark Dice is going to be joining us with all of his great
[01:33:55.413 --> 01:33:57.097]  Gravitas and Wit.
[01:33:57.097 --> 01:33:58.439]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:58.439 --> 01:33:58.479]  800-259-9231.
[01:34:06.792 --> 01:34:14.177]  Some of the news that's up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com is extremely, extremely important.
[01:34:14.177 --> 01:34:17.539]  We're going to be going over a lot of that.
[01:34:17.539 --> 01:34:21.681]  We have the latest, Maxine Waters loses it at a funeral.
[01:34:21.681 --> 01:34:23.562]  We're going to be playing that video.
[01:34:23.562 --> 01:34:25.103]  She is completely out of her mind.
[01:34:25.103 --> 01:34:30.046]  MSNBC worries Trump's use of the word sovereign is racist.
[01:34:30.046 --> 01:34:33.709]  We have Brian Williams there presiding, the maestro of
[01:34:34.449 --> 01:34:35.890]  Fraud of fake news.
[01:34:35.890 --> 01:34:37.751]  I mean, the arrogance of the system.
[01:34:37.751 --> 01:34:40.513]  But they know they're already caught as a pack of liars.
[01:34:40.513 --> 01:34:42.275]  And that's a bellwether.
[01:34:42.275 --> 01:34:46.638]  Or a reverse canary in the coal mine that they just don't care.
[01:34:46.638 --> 01:34:50.661]  They know, they are fully aware of the fact that you know they're liars.
[01:34:51.974 --> 01:34:54.956]  And they're just trying to be disruptive forces in society.
[01:34:54.956 --> 01:34:57.057]  So we'll be getting into that report.
[01:34:57.057 --> 01:35:09.884]  We're also going to be looking at the latest as the Democrats have been forced to come out and admit that indeed they were spying on Trump Associates and on Trump Towers, something Trump already knows.
[01:35:09.884 --> 01:35:11.584]  He just won't release the classified information.
[01:35:11.584 --> 01:35:13.525]  That's a violation of the law.
[01:35:13.525 --> 01:35:17.968]  They're the ones that illegally spied and illegally released the disinformation.
[01:35:19.349 --> 01:35:26.011]  Meanwhile, Muhammad is now the top English baby name for a fifth year in a row in England.
[01:35:26.011 --> 01:35:33.274]  And by 2040, England will be majority Muslim, just with the Muslim birth rate.
[01:35:33.274 --> 01:35:35.275]  And you will convert, or you will die.
[01:35:36.616 --> 01:35:40.558]  And the mayor is taking down pictures of women in swimming suits saying that's not allowed.
[01:35:40.558 --> 01:35:42.019]  It violates Sharia.
[01:35:42.019 --> 01:35:43.600]  And he says get used to terror.
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:51.384]  And now from Germany to Malaysia I have articles they're banning beer festivals because Muslims don't like it.
[01:35:51.384 --> 01:35:54.666]  That's all up on newswars.com right now.
[01:35:56.718 --> 01:36:03.422]  Prime Minister, the so-called conservative Prime Minister, who no one stayed to listen to at the UN yesterday, because she's so boring.
[01:36:03.422 --> 01:36:06.904]  That's how they sabotage conservatism, is they put another dead fish up there.
[01:36:06.904 --> 01:36:11.467]  She wears her little hijab and goes around London trying to get the Muslims to like her.
[01:36:11.467 --> 01:36:14.368]  The women are prisoners, most of the men are prisoners.
[01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:17.710]  It's a tribal system where local Islamic leaders control everybody.
[01:36:17.710 --> 01:36:19.411]  It's a slave colony.
[01:36:19.411 --> 01:36:21.853]  That's why Muslims will vote how they're told to vote.
[01:36:23.971 --> 01:36:29.135]  We're bringing in cults into the United States and into Europe that are totally uncompatible.
[01:36:29.135 --> 01:36:30.256]  It's a fact.
[01:36:30.256 --> 01:36:31.257]  So that's all coming up.
[01:36:31.257 --> 01:36:40.124]  Briefly, before we go to Larry Nichols, I want to just tell listeners that I was going to end the 50% off on storable food.
[01:36:40.124 --> 01:36:44.167]  And again, we don't raise the price and then lower it and then say it's 50% off.
[01:36:44.167 --> 01:36:51.673]  It's 50% off the regular discounted price of the entire catalog of My Patriot Supply.
[01:36:51.673 --> 01:36:53.295]  But I'm contractually, through a loophole,
[01:36:54.404 --> 01:36:55.085]  Thank you.
[01:37:17.619 --> 01:37:31.992]  50% off the MyPatriotSupplyFood under the label InfoWarsSelect at InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, or 888-253-3139 with promo code READY.
[01:37:31.992 --> 01:37:37.196]  See, I'm not able to offer it, but 10% off normally, contractually at MAP-agreed pricing.
[01:37:37.196 --> 01:37:39.238]  People that are in retail know these terms.
[01:37:39.238 --> 01:37:41.840]  But with the promo code, I can do this.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:43.462]  READY is the
[01:37:44.787 --> 01:37:46.008]  Promo code.
[01:37:46.008 --> 01:37:46.929]  Ready.
[01:37:46.929 --> 01:37:47.729]  50% off.
[01:37:47.729 --> 01:37:49.791]  They're specialty meals.
[01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:50.772]  They're bulk meals.
[01:37:50.772 --> 01:37:51.852]  The best packaging.
[01:37:51.852 --> 01:37:56.096]  It's in really nice plastic-sealed totes and vacuum-sealed packages inside.
[01:37:56.096 --> 01:37:57.337]  Last 25 years.
[01:37:57.337 --> 01:38:06.224]  With all the sunspots and earthquakes and wars and rumors of wars in North Korea and Soros trying to cause a new Bolshevik revolution.
[01:38:07.796 --> 01:38:10.459]  The key is being self-sufficient.
[01:38:10.459 --> 01:38:13.943]  90% of my energy spent trying to win the war against the globalists.
[01:38:13.943 --> 01:38:19.069]  10% is getting a redoubt ready, food ready, solar panels, firearms, you name it.
[01:38:20.333 --> 01:38:25.115]  Because we're hoping for the best, we're preparing for the worst around here, because we're up against some hardcore criminals.
[01:38:25.115 --> 01:38:34.078]  But it's insurance you can eat, unlike term or unlike a whole life or whatever, where, you know, who knows you'll ever get to use that life insurance.
[01:38:34.078 --> 01:38:36.819]  With food, take it with you camping.
[01:38:36.819 --> 01:38:39.440]  Give it away to the Salvation Army in five years if everything's okay.
[01:38:40.330 --> 01:38:41.452]  Eat it!
[01:38:41.452 --> 01:38:42.434]  Inflation's going up.
[01:38:42.434 --> 01:38:44.437]  You'll save money by getting the food now.
[01:38:44.437 --> 01:38:46.641]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:38:46.641 --> 01:38:47.863]  And when I tell you that...
[01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:56.023]  I mean, they're so good at My Patriot.
[01:38:56.023 --> 01:38:59.625]  It's a metric of the highest quality food for the best price.
[01:38:59.625 --> 01:39:03.928]  You can obviously pay five times more and get stuff that tastes like gourmet stuff at a restaurant.
[01:39:03.928 --> 01:39:05.029]  This tastes good.
[01:39:05.029 --> 01:39:06.410]  Some of it tastes great.
[01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:06.910]  It's healthy.
[01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:08.251]  It lasts a long time.
[01:39:08.251 --> 01:39:12.134]  It's what I've chosen for my family that's a metric of the most food for the best price.
[01:39:12.974 --> 01:39:17.498]  Uh, and at 50% off, you are not going to ever get food at a better price than that.
[01:39:17.498 --> 01:39:19.479]  The Sleep Aid, this special must end today.
[01:39:19.479 --> 01:39:22.702]  Knockout, 40% off from InfoWarsLife.
[01:39:22.702 --> 01:39:27.546]  The entire Super Blue Fluoride-Free Toothpaste, that special's going to end basically now.
[01:39:27.546 --> 01:39:29.687]  I've been so busy, I haven't come up with any specials.
[01:39:29.687 --> 01:39:31.709]  Tim Fouchier this morning, he's going on vacation for a week.
[01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:34.932]  He's like, Alex, you gotta come up with a new specials, because I'm the guy that does this.
[01:39:35.672 --> 01:39:37.573]  And I just, I just haven't done it yet.
[01:39:37.573 --> 01:39:40.253]  So he's like, okay, we're about to sell out of the toothpaste.
[01:39:40.253 --> 01:39:42.814]  So it's not good that you sell it out at this price.
[01:39:42.814 --> 01:39:49.176]  You should, you know, when we're about to sell it anyways, have a week or so, but at full price, because you could have, you know, fund the operation.
[01:39:49.176 --> 01:39:50.856]  That's just not how I think.
[01:39:50.856 --> 01:39:51.737]  It does make sense.
[01:39:51.737 --> 01:39:53.637]  It's about to go back to full price.
[01:39:53.637 --> 01:39:55.158]  50% off on all that.
[01:39:55.158 --> 01:39:58.859]  Emrix Essentials, 50% off on those.
[01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.099]  Never done that before.
[01:40:00.099 --> 01:40:02.320]  Caveman, I'll be able to extend this in the next week.
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:03.420]  The other stuff is about to end.
[01:40:03.800 --> 01:40:05.742]  I just got a couple of new specials.
[01:40:05.742 --> 01:40:09.465]  That is 50% off on the great bone broth formula.
[01:40:09.465 --> 01:40:10.225]  The best out there.
[01:40:10.225 --> 01:40:11.426]  Concentrated bone broth.
[01:40:11.426 --> 01:40:15.750]  The secrets in the bones with the turmeric, with the mushrooms, chaga mushrooms, with the bee pollen and more.
[01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:16.611]  It's amazing.
[01:40:16.611 --> 01:40:18.052]  And chocolate and strawberry flavor.
[01:40:18.052 --> 01:40:19.753]  50% off right now.
[01:40:19.753 --> 01:40:20.574]  And so much more.
[01:40:20.574 --> 01:40:23.517]  InfoWarsLife, InfoWarsStore, InfoWarsStore.com, 888-253-3139.
[01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.959]  And your purchase makes it all possible.
[01:40:25.959 --> 01:40:26.659]  So we salute you.
[01:40:31.423 --> 01:40:32.723]  And we thank you.
[01:40:32.723 --> 01:40:35.144]  And again, I appreciate all of your support.
[01:40:35.144 --> 01:40:38.705]  You are thumbing your nose at the globalists, but you're doing more.
[01:40:38.705 --> 01:40:41.866]  You're gouging their political eyeballs out.
[01:40:41.866 --> 01:40:45.747]  You are bashing their head into the concrete savagely.
[01:40:45.747 --> 01:40:50.948]  When you spread the word, when you spread a video, when you spread an article, you are standing against their censorship.
[01:40:50.948 --> 01:40:53.229]  You, with brute physical force,
[01:40:54.229 --> 01:40:55.850]  You are overriding their AI.
[01:40:55.850 --> 01:40:57.110]  You are smashing them.
[01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:59.311]  You are crushing them.
[01:40:59.311 --> 01:41:04.174]  Hillary just shakes calling me the dark art because she knows I don't care what she does to me.
[01:41:04.174 --> 01:41:06.015]  I'm so committed.
[01:41:06.015 --> 01:41:07.555]  It's absolute Valhalla.
[01:41:07.555 --> 01:41:09.016]  I'll just be honest with you.
[01:41:09.016 --> 01:41:12.798]  Just to run over these people spiritually with God filling our sails.
[01:41:12.798 --> 01:41:17.520]  Just to absolutely be committed and to feel our will crushing their will.
[01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.201]  It's easy to crush their will.
[01:41:19.991 --> 01:41:21.452]  It's so easy!
[01:41:21.452 --> 01:41:24.393]  How they tricked us into this position, I'll never understand.
[01:41:24.393 --> 01:41:29.476]  It's time to politically crush them.
[01:41:29.476 --> 01:41:31.157]  It's time to break with these bullies.
[01:41:31.157 --> 01:41:35.699]  It's time to let them know, and they know the spirit is rising.
[01:41:35.699 --> 01:41:39.221]  Now, speaking of bullies, I'm going to play this clip, then play a Schaefer clip, and then go to Larry Nichols.
[01:41:42.634 --> 01:41:45.515]  Jimmy Kimmel threatening to assault Fox News.
[01:41:45.515 --> 01:41:49.755]  Because Kimmel goes, oh, you know, my son has a heart problem, he won't get health care.
[01:41:49.755 --> 01:41:51.356]  This system will wreck our health care.
[01:41:51.356 --> 01:41:52.916]  It's designed to wreck our health care.
[01:41:52.916 --> 01:41:59.057]  That's now admitted by Pocahontas and by Ezekiel Emanuel and everybody else and Gruber.
[01:41:59.057 --> 01:42:01.377]  Said, thank God you're so dumb, ha ha ha.
[01:42:01.377 --> 01:42:02.598]  It triples prices.
[01:42:02.598 --> 01:42:06.098]  I mean, this, and then they got Kimmel up there reading off a teleprompter.
[01:42:06.098 --> 01:42:10.359]  He probably believes Obamacare is really free and that, you know, money grows on trees and that
[01:42:12.311 --> 01:42:16.854]  Tooth Fairy's real.
[01:42:16.854 --> 01:42:19.596]  And so now he's threatening to assault someone.
[01:42:19.596 --> 01:42:20.577]  This is the culture.
[01:42:20.577 --> 01:42:23.419]  What they're being told to push is let's get aggressive.
[01:42:23.419 --> 01:42:25.460]  Let's hashtag hunt Republicans.
[01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:28.282]  Let's shoot Congressman Scalise.
[01:42:28.282 --> 01:42:30.403]  Let's engage in some firebomb throwing.
[01:42:30.403 --> 01:42:31.824]  Let's intimidate everybody.
[01:42:31.824 --> 01:42:34.546]  It's not intimidating a scum.
[01:42:34.546 --> 01:42:37.128]  It's causing the opposite reaction, dumbass.
[01:42:37.128 --> 01:42:38.069]  Excuse me.
[01:42:38.069 --> 01:42:38.509]  Here's the clip.
[01:42:39.838 --> 01:42:40.218]  Thanks, Brian.
[01:42:40.218 --> 01:42:41.219]  That was Brian Kilmeade.
[01:42:41.219 --> 01:42:47.802]  And the reason I found this comment to be particularly annoying is because this is a guy, Brian Kilmeade, who, whenever I see him, kisses my ass like a little boy meets a Batman.
[01:42:47.802 --> 01:42:48.623]  Oh, he's such a fan.
[01:42:48.623 --> 01:42:49.883]  I think he's been to the show.
[01:43:07.449 --> 01:43:09.310]  He follows me on Twitter.
[01:43:09.310 --> 01:43:11.632]  He had a blurb for his book, which I did.
[01:43:11.632 --> 01:43:14.293]  He calls my agent looking for projects.
[01:43:14.293 --> 01:43:17.235]  He's dying to be a member of the Hollywood elite.
[01:43:17.235 --> 01:43:20.878]  The only reason he's not a member of the Hollywood elite is because nobody will hire him to be one.
[01:43:20.878 --> 01:43:27.042]  And you know, the reason I'm talking about this is because my son had an open heart surgery and has to have two more.
[01:43:27.042 --> 01:43:30.704]  And because of that, I learned that there are kids with no insurance in the same situation.
[01:43:30.704 --> 01:43:34.146]  I don't get anything out of this, Brian, you phony little creep.
[01:43:34.146 --> 01:43:36.147]  Oh, I'll pound you when I see you.
[01:43:38.509 --> 01:43:44.511]  Using his kid to sell a program that will bankrupt the country and take health care from our children.
[01:43:44.511 --> 01:43:46.652]  Brian Kilmeade is a phony little creep.
[01:43:46.652 --> 01:43:50.654]  That's right.
[01:43:50.654 --> 01:43:56.857]  Well, I want to tell Jimmy Kimmel something right now.
[01:43:56.857 --> 01:43:59.558]  Brian Kilmeade has more viewers than you do.
[01:43:59.558 --> 01:44:01.519]  A. And B.
[01:44:03.444 --> 01:44:13.830]  I've been in major Hollywood films, and I've been offered starring roles on HBO, on everything.
[01:44:13.830 --> 01:44:14.891]  And guess what I do now?
[01:44:14.891 --> 01:44:17.273]  I don't even return the phone calls, buddy.
[01:44:17.273 --> 01:44:32.362]  So let me tell you, my enjoyment, at the end of the day, I don't get off being a quote celebrity or being well-known, I get off watching Hollywood die, and watching your whole sick system hang on by its fingernails, and by watching all your ratings go into the toilet,
[01:44:33.652 --> 01:44:38.135]  And by knowing your psychological warfare hold on all of us is almost gone.
[01:44:38.135 --> 01:44:41.637]  You know, 20 years ago getting put in movies I thought was cool.
[01:44:41.637 --> 01:44:43.198]  And it was a little bit fun.
[01:44:43.198 --> 01:44:45.300]  And you go with your family to the movie and there you are in the movie.
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:49.723]  You know what my big pleasure is?
[01:44:49.723 --> 01:44:57.348]  My big pleasure is saying, I don't want that major supporting role in a science fiction movie.
[01:44:59.011 --> 01:45:02.212]  I don't want that major role in a Western.
[01:45:02.212 --> 01:45:04.752]  I don't want a major role in your political thriller.
[01:45:04.752 --> 01:45:12.494]  I'm going to go do a super cheesy B-movie with a bunch of weirdos in Texas because it's funny.
[01:45:12.494 --> 01:45:15.275]  And then I'm going to sit there and put it on TV and I'm going to laugh at it with my kids.
[01:45:15.275 --> 01:45:15.675]  It's fun.
[01:45:15.675 --> 01:45:18.896]  The kind of movies I'm in.
[01:45:18.896 --> 01:45:27.618]  Because you understand, turning down the big slick role and then going and doing the little underground thing, it's just, it's what rock and roll wishes it was.
[01:45:30.478 --> 01:45:36.444]  See, John Wayne was an actor and a patriot and a great guy, but he's still just an actor.
[01:45:36.444 --> 01:45:41.209]  But there is that real image of John Wayne that's the Americana, and I want that, you see.
[01:45:41.209 --> 01:45:48.977]  I want to never give in, never back down, never roll over, and I want to put on my tombstone that he hammered their asses.
[01:45:50.623 --> 01:45:52.185]  That I took out the tyrants.
[01:45:52.185 --> 01:45:54.028]  That I ran over the scum.
[01:45:54.028 --> 01:45:55.690]  That I stood up against the pedophiles.
[01:45:55.690 --> 01:45:59.015]  Not because I was some hero, but because my instincts were straight.
[01:45:59.015 --> 01:46:01.919]  I was lined up with God as my North Star.
[01:46:01.919 --> 01:46:05.625]  You couldn't keep me away from getting my hands around these people's necks politically.
[01:46:06.730 --> 01:46:10.594]  So Kimmel really has got a big one where he talks about his son and his heart surgery.
[01:46:10.594 --> 01:46:22.685]  Kimmel, I care about you and your son and I hope you research how GMO in all rat species and in all rodent species and in all mammal species is linked to causing all sorts of heart valve defects.
[01:46:22.685 --> 01:46:26.529]  That's where you start getting, is where the body kind of folds in during embryonic development.
[01:46:26.529 --> 01:46:27.430]  That's why you get hair lips.
[01:46:28.595 --> 01:46:35.638]  That's why a lot of them's hair lips are associated with heart defects as well, because the body's seaming up those little things.
[01:46:35.638 --> 01:46:48.165]  And if there's toxins, if there's GMO, if there's vaccines, if your wife took a vaccine during the first trimester, I've got the big studies, I covered them yesterday, even CNN had mentioned massive increase in heart valve defects.
[01:46:48.165 --> 01:46:51.346]  So Kimmel, why don't you tell people about the vaccines?
[01:46:51.346 --> 01:46:52.267]  I bet you don't know.
[01:46:53.047 --> 01:46:56.851]  The media will say Jones makes fun of Kimmel's son and his heart defect.
[01:46:56.851 --> 01:47:01.917]  No, I care about your son and all the other kids that are getting heart defects that are all way up Kimmel.
[01:47:01.917 --> 01:47:07.402]  So why don't you stop beating up on one of the little candy asses over there at Fox News.
[01:47:08.203 --> 01:47:14.208]  And stop using your son to talk about how you're going to kick people's asses to promote violence in America.
[01:47:14.208 --> 01:47:14.649]  How about that?
[01:47:14.649 --> 01:47:15.970]  How about you actually help some kids, buddy?
[01:47:15.970 --> 01:47:17.511]  Instead of using your kid.
[01:47:17.511 --> 01:47:22.796]  Instead of pimping your kid out there to push Obamacare that's designed to wreck healthcare.
[01:47:22.796 --> 01:47:24.297]  Now, maybe you don't know what you're doing.
[01:47:24.297 --> 01:47:25.358]  And that's okay.
[01:47:25.358 --> 01:47:26.979]  So we forgive you.
[01:47:26.979 --> 01:47:27.760]  Kimmel.
[01:47:27.760 --> 01:47:30.642]  Good.
[01:47:30.642 --> 01:47:34.125]  Now... By the way, let me just say this.
[01:47:34.125 --> 01:47:35.326]  I don't want to go on Kimmel's show.
[01:47:36.460 --> 01:47:37.741]  I don't want to go on The Daily Show.
[01:47:37.741 --> 01:47:38.602]  I don't want to go on any of them.
[01:47:38.602 --> 01:47:40.603]  And we've had offers before to go on these shows.
[01:47:40.603 --> 01:47:43.946]  I'm not going... I piss on your... You're not real shows.
[01:47:43.946 --> 01:47:45.087]  You're frauds.
[01:47:45.087 --> 01:47:45.948]  You're crap.
[01:47:45.948 --> 01:47:46.708]  You're the enemy.
[01:47:46.708 --> 01:47:47.569]  You're cancer.
[01:47:47.569 --> 01:47:49.791]  You're grandma dying of a heart attack.
[01:47:49.791 --> 01:47:51.812]  You're grandpa with a brain tumor.
[01:47:51.812 --> 01:47:52.693]  You're failure.
[01:47:52.693 --> 01:47:53.834]  You're betrayal.
[01:47:53.834 --> 01:47:55.095]  You're anathema.
[01:47:55.095 --> 01:47:58.097]  You're a blaspheme.
[01:47:58.097 --> 01:47:59.979]  And you will fall.
[01:47:59.979 --> 01:48:01.960]  You're already falling right now.
[01:48:01.960 --> 01:48:02.781]  I'm sorry for your son.
[01:48:06.502 --> 01:48:07.942]  Did your wife take the vaccines?
[01:48:07.942 --> 01:48:12.044]  Been slurping that tap water?
[01:48:12.044 --> 01:48:14.384]  Why don't you find out why this is happening?
[01:48:14.384 --> 01:48:23.727]  Why don't you actually save other kids instead of using your kid to bring in socialism and globalist control for big fat cat corporations that want to make us buy overpriced health care?
[01:48:23.727 --> 01:48:26.247]  How about that?
[01:48:26.247 --> 01:48:27.628]  You ever seen My Little Kids on TV?
[01:48:27.628 --> 01:48:29.508]  Other than my son likes to go on?
[01:48:29.508 --> 01:48:33.229]  Have I used my five-month-old daughter in Twitter and Facebook?
[01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:34.690]  Maybe I should because she's so cute.
[01:48:34.690 --> 01:48:35.210]  I love her.
[01:48:35.210 --> 01:48:35.610]  Proud of her.
[01:48:36.991 --> 01:48:38.553]  Well, Alex, a lot's going on.
[01:48:38.553 --> 01:48:39.654]  A lot's going on behind the scenes.
[01:48:56.676 --> 01:49:00.378]  Robert Mueller is moving at breakneck speed now.
[01:49:00.378 --> 01:49:04.120]  As you know, you're in the hurricanes, which is always what they do.
[01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:11.324]  When everybody's looking at the hurricanes, paying attention to that, they're slipping around in the dark and nobody sees them.
[01:49:11.324 --> 01:49:16.847]  He's now going after, he has gone after documents in the White House.
[01:49:17.427 --> 01:49:22.951]  He's going after anything in the White House that has to do with Colby's firing.
[01:49:22.951 --> 01:49:24.091]  And talk about rogues!
[01:49:24.091 --> 01:49:25.913]  They're admitting this has never been done.
[01:49:25.913 --> 01:49:27.414]  It's the most aggressive thing.
[01:49:27.414 --> 01:49:29.655]  They're grabbing stuff that aren't even in search warrants.
[01:49:29.655 --> 01:49:31.776]  They're demanding everybody's communiques.
[01:49:31.776 --> 01:49:35.339]  I mean, Mueller is the Lord High Executioner.
[01:49:35.339 --> 01:49:36.359]  Absolutely.
[01:49:36.359 --> 01:49:39.441]  And folks, Alex, I'm telling you.
[01:49:39.441 --> 01:49:40.842]  It's written all over.
[01:49:40.842 --> 01:49:42.143]  You can see it.
[01:49:42.143 --> 01:49:45.225]  They're coming after Trump with impeachment.
[01:49:46.894 --> 01:49:48.275]  They've got to impeach him.
[01:49:48.275 --> 01:49:49.616]  They've got to get him out.
[01:49:49.616 --> 01:49:55.441]  Well, the problem that Trump has, as you know, other than this program and alternative media, he has no voice.
[01:50:17.873 --> 01:50:21.476]  And remember, y'all, this is what hurts.
[01:50:21.476 --> 01:50:34.606]  Still to this day, probably 95 to 98% of the people in this country of voting age get everything they think they need from the news in their 6 and 10 o'clock TV news.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:48.616]  And if that's all you use, let me tell you, if you want six and ten o'clock news, Alex, you realize in those local newscasts you get four to seven minutes of national news.
[01:50:48.616 --> 01:50:49.698]  Larry, it's worse than that.
[01:50:49.698 --> 01:50:50.398]  It's worse than that.
[01:50:50.979 --> 01:51:00.342]  They had deactivated 80% of the public that never watches news who were just, weren't even voters, weren't even involved in the political process most of the time.
[01:51:00.342 --> 01:51:05.264]  They're now weaponizing all the entertainment shows, putting disinfo out in those.
[01:51:05.264 --> 01:51:12.006]  They're activating, first they tried to turn the public off from politics, now they're trying to activate the zombies.
[01:51:12.006 --> 01:51:12.386]  That's right.
[01:51:12.386 --> 01:51:17.968]  I mean if you look at what they're doing with all of their programming, they're using programming
[01:51:18.908 --> 01:51:23.791]  To watch, to do what they've been doing to our kids in school.
[01:51:23.791 --> 01:51:26.773]  You know, it's nothing but brainwashing.
[01:51:26.773 --> 01:51:31.196]  If you watch the entertainment shows, you're being brainwashed.
[01:51:31.196 --> 01:51:33.817]  And I'm talking about the dramas, the comedies.
[01:51:33.817 --> 01:51:34.838]  No, I totally agree with you.
[01:51:34.838 --> 01:51:35.838]  But how big is it?
[01:51:35.838 --> 01:51:40.541]  Why are they now coming out admitting that Trump Tower was spied on, that Trump was spied on Manafort?
[01:51:40.541 --> 01:51:45.444]  Because they're getting ready to try to use the phony contacts they got through those phone calls.
[01:51:45.444 --> 01:51:47.726]  They're about to use the wiretapping they said didn't exist.
[01:51:48.780 --> 01:51:49.541]  That's right.
[01:51:49.541 --> 01:51:51.983]  They have to declare it because they're going to use it.
[01:51:51.983 --> 01:51:59.431]  They're going to use illegally obtained wiretaps to impeach President Trump.
[01:51:59.431 --> 01:52:03.735]  Look, we talked about it before, but Alex, it's getting serious.
[01:52:03.735 --> 01:52:06.919]  As you're pointing out, what you're saying right now is 100% the truth.
[01:52:09.545 --> 01:52:10.026]  100%.
[01:52:10.026 --> 01:52:12.630]  They're all in.
[01:52:12.630 --> 01:52:15.274]  Guys, it's everything for them.
[01:52:15.274 --> 01:52:20.201]  They win, or as far as they're concerned, they lose and it's over.
[01:52:21.067 --> 01:52:39.342]  They're playing every chip they got, every move they got, down to... My gosh, you would think the entertainment industry, just like you were talking about, you would think the entertainment industry would sit back and say, golly gee, you know, the Indies,
[01:52:40.205 --> 01:52:43.787]  The programming we're doing is losing viewers left and right.
[01:52:43.787 --> 01:52:45.828]  They don't care because they plan a total overthrow.
[01:52:45.828 --> 01:52:47.009]  I mean, you're right.
[01:52:47.009 --> 01:52:48.910]  Their whole posture is total overthrow.
[01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:50.071]  We're not backing down.
[01:52:50.071 --> 01:52:56.894]  They're going to try to overthrow the political realignment, bring in a Venezuelan control arm, have fake elections here on out.
[01:52:56.894 --> 01:52:57.895]  And how do we know that?
[01:52:57.895 --> 01:53:02.578]  They've said it in their elite publications, like Atlantic Monthly.
[01:53:02.578 --> 01:53:07.781]  And you saw Hillary two days ago say she still plans to overturn the election.
[01:53:07.781 --> 01:53:08.321]  That's right.
[01:53:09.184 --> 01:53:18.051]  Look, all it's going to take is Mueller, through his fake grand jury, to bring impeachment to the House of Representatives.
[01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:23.695]  And they know, they know that the Republicans in the House are a bunch of cowards.
[01:53:23.695 --> 01:53:24.696]  Cowards?
[01:53:24.696 --> 01:53:25.116]  You bet.
[01:53:25.116 --> 01:53:29.359]  They're cowards, and the leadership, they're traitors.
[01:53:29.359 --> 01:53:35.444]  Now, that's why we've got the plan, the only plan that I see, viable.
[01:53:35.444 --> 01:53:37.766]  There's nothing Alex, you and I can do to stop
[01:53:38.487 --> 01:53:40.451]  Mueller from impeaching Trump.
[01:53:40.451 --> 01:53:41.513]  Nothing.
[01:53:41.513 --> 01:53:43.377]  But here's what we can do.
[01:53:43.377 --> 01:53:47.765]  When he takes that to the House to get them to hold an impeachment hearing,
[01:53:48.439 --> 01:53:49.699]  We can stop them.
[01:53:49.699 --> 01:53:51.140]  We can stop them cold.
[01:53:51.140 --> 01:53:57.341]  Because folks, the math, I hate to tell everybody, the math is on our side.
[01:53:57.341 --> 01:53:59.922]  And by the way, we gotta get this going now.
[01:53:59.922 --> 01:54:01.462]  No impeachment of Trump.
[01:54:01.462 --> 01:54:02.503]  Indictment of Mueller.
[01:54:02.503 --> 01:54:03.643]  Indictment of Comey.
[01:54:03.643 --> 01:54:04.763]  Indictment of Hillary.
[01:54:04.763 --> 01:54:08.864]  That's why I've told Trump, every time I talk to him, I say, sir, they're never gonna stop.
[01:54:08.864 --> 01:54:10.085]  You've gotta indict Hillary.
[01:54:10.085 --> 01:54:11.145]  And he knows that.
[01:54:11.145 --> 01:54:15.466]  And he goes to Sessions, and I know you know Sessions, and I'm gonna leave it at that.
[01:54:15.686 --> 01:54:17.127]  Sessions has been a good guy.
[01:54:17.127 --> 01:54:19.789]  What is his problem?
[01:54:19.789 --> 01:54:25.694]  Alex, the problem with Jeff Sessions is this.
[01:54:25.694 --> 01:54:27.135]  He turns around.
[01:54:27.135 --> 01:54:30.157]  He doesn't do the prosecuting himself.
[01:54:30.157 --> 01:54:35.881]  And when he turns around and hands to his people below him... They all refuse to do what he says.
[01:54:35.881 --> 01:54:39.464]  Because he's stuck between the Bush and the Clinton and the Obama.
[01:54:39.464 --> 01:54:40.064]  You're right.
[01:54:40.064 --> 01:54:41.866]  He's got three to four administrations.
[01:54:43.454 --> 01:54:45.631]  Of bad people in there, he's totally surrounded.
[01:54:46.567 --> 01:54:47.468]  He's surrounded.
[01:54:47.468 --> 01:54:49.309]  The same thing happens with Trump.
[01:54:49.309 --> 01:54:53.232]  You know, Trump's trying to do the agenda he set forth in his campaign.
[01:54:53.232 --> 01:54:56.195]  But he turns around, and who's stabbing him in the back?
[01:54:56.195 --> 01:54:57.115]  Not the Democrats.
[01:54:57.115 --> 01:54:58.296]  You're doing the crap.
[01:54:58.296 --> 01:55:05.202]  By the way, anybody that's ever run even a small company or a medium company knows, even when you have good people, it's hard to get them all going in the same direction.
[01:55:05.202 --> 01:55:09.105]  Imagine tens of thousands of people that are political operatives in D.C.
[01:55:09.105 --> 01:55:12.487]  scum who hate you and think you're about to be gone.
[01:55:12.487 --> 01:55:14.469]  They are all lockstep in mutiny.
[01:55:14.469 --> 01:55:15.670]  So what do we the people do?
[01:55:16.857 --> 01:55:17.718]  Alright.
[01:55:17.718 --> 01:55:22.601]  First off, I want to make a statement, if I may, to the Republicans.
[01:55:22.601 --> 01:55:31.186]  To every Republican in the House of Representatives, I make this pledge to you today, right here with Alex Jones.
[01:55:31.186 --> 01:55:35.849]  I will use the information that I have on every one of you.
[01:55:36.633 --> 01:55:41.858]  Every one of you and I will destroy every one of you.
[01:55:41.858 --> 01:55:46.322]  The problem now is with Republicans is they're conservative supposedly.
[01:55:46.322 --> 01:55:48.004]  They're moral supposedly.
[01:55:48.004 --> 01:55:49.365]  They're Christians supposedly.
[01:55:49.365 --> 01:55:51.187]  And most of them, they put sex ops on them.
[01:55:51.187 --> 01:55:52.308]  Most of them are cheating on their wives.
[01:55:54.106 --> 01:55:55.148]  We're good to go.
[01:56:12.822 --> 01:56:23.485]  Very soon, you're going to receive thousands, thousands of phone calls in your state office and your national office, federal office in Washington.
[01:56:23.485 --> 01:56:32.087]  And it's going to be people reading the script, telling you that you must stop the impeachment of President Trump.
[01:56:32.087 --> 01:56:34.547]  They all know it's a bogus case.
[01:56:34.547 --> 01:56:36.488]  Everyone knows it.
[01:56:36.488 --> 01:56:37.448]  And if they don't,
[01:56:38.740 --> 01:56:47.486]  If they don't, I pledge right here on the word that I gave Bill Clinton in 1990, I'll destroy you.
[01:56:47.486 --> 01:56:48.867]  And I don't mean just keep opening up the cells.
[01:56:48.867 --> 01:56:49.267]  I damn sure did.
[01:56:49.267 --> 01:56:49.667]  I damn sure did.
[01:56:49.667 --> 01:56:53.990]  And I'm telling them all, if you don't believe I'll do it, you better dial 1-800-BILL-AND-HILLARY-CLINTON and ask them
[01:57:03.917 --> 01:57:06.039]  But let me throw this out right now.
[01:57:06.039 --> 01:57:07.020]  You are 100% correct.
[01:57:07.020 --> 01:57:09.703]  You've been saying it for eight months.
[01:57:09.703 --> 01:57:10.844]  They're going to cook it up.
[01:57:10.844 --> 01:57:16.990]  They never found any Russia, so now it's going to be taxes, or this or that, and I didn't dot it, T didn't cross.
[01:57:16.990 --> 01:57:18.332]  They now admit that.
[01:57:18.332 --> 01:57:24.498]  And as dirty as Mueller and as dirty as Comey are with all their criminal cover-ups, Hillary doesn't get in trouble.
[01:57:24.498 --> 01:57:25.479]  None of them do.
[01:57:25.479 --> 01:57:26.740]  It's Trump with made-up crap.
[01:57:27.521 --> 01:57:31.564]  We, you're right, we can't wait to get on this impeachment once it starts.
[01:57:31.564 --> 01:57:35.386]  We've got to be hammering them now, every day.
[01:57:35.386 --> 01:57:36.807]  Hammer, hammer, hammer.
[01:57:36.807 --> 01:57:38.989]  You're not going to overturn our election.
[01:57:38.989 --> 01:57:51.357]  You're not going to, just like a jury can veto a judge or whatever, we have got to have the American people know, we voted Trump in, not the Russians, and we're vetoing Mueller, and we're vetoing all these traitors.
[01:57:51.357 --> 01:57:54.499]  They say he's evil for saying America first at the UN.
[01:57:54.499 --> 01:57:56.140]  They're obviously the enemies!
[01:57:56.140 --> 01:57:56.801]  Good Lord!
[01:57:57.501 --> 01:58:00.283]  That's why they're pissed is because we have an American president.
[01:58:00.283 --> 01:58:04.186]  And it doesn't mean he's perfect, but he's not out to get the country, and that's why they hate him.
[01:58:04.186 --> 01:58:13.232]  And Robert Mueller, don't believe that I haven't been able to acquire a whole bunch of dirt on you, buddy.
[01:58:13.232 --> 01:58:14.894]  Now, I know.
[01:58:14.894 --> 01:58:15.634]  Alex, I know.
[01:58:15.634 --> 01:58:18.216]  They're going to destroy me, which is fine.
[01:58:18.216 --> 01:58:18.896]  Fine.
[01:58:18.896 --> 01:58:22.219]  And by the way, this isn't Alex Jones, this is me.
[01:58:22.219 --> 01:58:25.001]  But I swear to God, for God almighty,
[01:58:26.511 --> 01:58:30.272]  I will not let y'all destroy this country!
[01:58:30.272 --> 01:58:33.593]  Now... Hold on Larry, let's come back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:33.593 --> 01:58:38.034]  We'll take some phone calls as well.

[02:00:06.701 --> 02:00:15.566]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.566 --> 02:00:20.048]  All right, we got Kevin.
[02:00:20.048 --> 02:00:22.190]  Let's talk about artificial intelligence.
[02:00:22.190 --> 02:00:24.331]  George, let's talk about local level involvement.
[02:00:24.331 --> 02:00:26.532]  Jesse, let's talk about geoengineering.
[02:00:26.532 --> 02:00:28.953]  Melissa, I kind of got behind here, but I'm going to be getting to your calls.
[02:00:28.953 --> 02:00:30.234]  Melissa, let's talk about vaccines.
[02:00:30.234 --> 02:00:33.736]  But all of these agendas that are going on out there,
[02:00:36.343 --> 02:00:45.580]  Or a bit around the fact that if we get our country back under the control of our own government and not special interest, then we can fix all those problems.
[02:00:46.499 --> 02:00:54.462]  But Larry, you've seen the arrogance of Hillary thinking she was going to win, and her now saying on three different programs they plan to overturn the election.
[02:00:54.462 --> 02:01:07.087]  I hope the cowardly Republicans know if they just read the Financial Times or the COG article out of Atlantic Monthly, their plan or foreign affairs or public affairs, they've all four written articles saying the same thing.
[02:01:08.027 --> 02:01:09.207]  C.O.G.
[02:01:09.207 --> 02:01:25.312]  bring government under a civil emergency under C.O.G., have the shadow government then administer the new election, and then we never have a real election again, and they said all the Republicans that were in the last election will be removed and will be under a new election.
[02:01:25.312 --> 02:01:32.574]  That's why Obama signed that executive order federalizing elections that all 50 attorney generals, including Democrats, said no to.
[02:01:32.574 --> 02:01:35.334]  I mean, this isn't as plain as the nose on your face, Larry.
[02:01:35.334 --> 02:01:36.935]  They've stated their battle plan.
[02:01:38.237 --> 02:01:38.898]  Absolutely.
[02:01:38.898 --> 02:01:44.522]  But again, remember, this is what I've got to convince your audience, Alex.
[02:01:44.522 --> 02:01:49.425]  We have the math on our side and Republican congressmen.
[02:01:49.425 --> 02:01:51.266]  You better hear this.
[02:01:51.266 --> 02:01:55.489]  You don't have a base of support.
[02:01:55.489 --> 02:01:58.211]  Donald Trump has a base.
[02:01:58.211 --> 02:02:05.076]  The only elections Republicans have won since Ronald Reagan was the lesser of two evils.
[02:02:05.076 --> 02:02:06.057]  President Trump
[02:02:07.099 --> 02:02:12.863]  He owns the Republican Party in this upcoming primary.
[02:02:12.863 --> 02:02:21.728]  And we will pick two to half a dozen Republicans in the next three weeks, maybe four.
[02:02:21.728 --> 02:02:23.029]  And Alex, we're going to burn them.
[02:02:23.029 --> 02:02:25.230]  We're going to burn them hard.
[02:02:25.230 --> 02:02:27.291]  I feel sorry for them in a way they deserve it.
[02:02:31.546 --> 02:02:32.266]  No, you're right.
[02:02:32.266 --> 02:02:35.207]  I mean, listen, Ryan's hanging on by his fingernails.
[02:02:35.207 --> 02:02:40.149]  We've got to pick some mid-level ones that have been cowardly and burn them so the others understand.
[02:02:40.149 --> 02:02:42.149]  You fear sorrows?
[02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:44.730]  You better fear us, you little creatures!
[02:02:44.730 --> 02:02:45.390]  That's right.
[02:02:45.390 --> 02:03:00.735]  Alex says right now, listening to this program today, the number of people that will listen to this broadcast today far exceeds, Alex, the numbers in the paid organization called Antifa.
[02:03:01.795 --> 02:03:04.297]  They have to be paid to do what they're doing.
[02:03:04.297 --> 02:03:09.061]  This audience does it for love of country and love of God.
[02:03:09.061 --> 02:03:10.762]  Well, and it's beyond that.
[02:03:10.762 --> 02:03:12.363]  We're going to be conquered, dominated.
[02:03:12.363 --> 02:03:15.746]  People now are really starting to fight hard because they realize this is serious.
[02:03:15.746 --> 02:03:16.447]  It's here.
[02:03:16.447 --> 02:03:24.113]  Everything we've warned of, everything we've tried to stop, but notice right as they're about to crest and take over, Trump stands up, all this other stuff happens.
[02:03:24.113 --> 02:03:25.454]  God's giving us a chance right now.
[02:03:26.895 --> 02:03:27.475]  Absolutely.
[02:03:27.475 --> 02:03:32.917]  Every day, Alex, I'll hear from people that get on with me.
[02:03:32.917 --> 02:03:36.959]  And people tell me, people I would have never dreamed would come from them.
[02:03:36.959 --> 02:03:40.340]  They tell me they have turned off their televisions.
[02:03:40.340 --> 02:03:43.762]  Some of them have said they've thrown them out of their homes.
[02:03:43.762 --> 02:03:47.883]  And they listen to this network, yours.
[02:03:47.883 --> 02:03:49.464]  That's all they listen to.
[02:03:49.464 --> 02:03:56.387]  Millions of people have awoken to the degree that they've thrown the damn televisions out of the house.
[02:03:57.816 --> 02:04:05.521]  And the next move, the next move, the next move is just have them run for office, have them call Congress, have them do YouTube videos, and we will overwhelm the enemy.
[02:04:05.521 --> 02:04:07.322]  This is a total fight for our lives.
[02:04:07.322 --> 02:04:11.025]  LarryNichols.news, LarryNichols.news, a lot of great information there.
[02:04:11.025 --> 02:04:11.925]  Larry, thank you so much.
[02:04:11.925 --> 02:04:13.126]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[02:04:13.126 --> 02:04:14.447]  There goes Larry Nichols.
[02:04:14.447 --> 02:04:15.528]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:15.528 --> 02:04:19.350]  Now, I know, folks, Larry's awesome, and I'd forgotten I had him on.
[02:04:19.350 --> 02:04:22.272]  I got so wound up, I didn't even look at my call list there.
[02:04:22.272 --> 02:04:25.575]  NicholsLive.com, if you want to support him, his new book's out.
[02:04:25.575 --> 02:04:27.316]  Larry Nichols, live.
[02:04:28.076 --> 02:04:31.918]  But before I go any further here, I'll just get behind.
[02:04:31.918 --> 02:04:34.320]  I'll open the phones up and then I'll get another guest on and then I'll get to your calls.
[02:04:34.320 --> 02:04:39.022]  But he's coming up and it's Mark Dice.
[02:04:39.022 --> 02:04:40.843]  We're going to talk to him and then we'll take your calls.
[02:04:40.843 --> 02:04:47.687]  It'll be a nice grab bag of interesting questions that are kind of wild card for Mark Dice straight ahead.
[02:04:47.687 --> 02:04:49.868]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[02:04:49.868 --> 02:04:50.689]  Please spread those sites.
[02:04:53.655 --> 02:04:59.737]  Prepping for disaster and societal unrest has now gone so mainstream that even Realtor.com is writing about it.
[02:04:59.737 --> 02:05:09.001]  But the Realtors are still embarrassed to cover the subject and eager to set themselves apart from what they call Uncle Travis' guns and canned foods militia vision of preparedness.
[02:05:09.001 --> 02:05:11.322]  Well, the ants may have the last laugh
[02:05:11.542 --> 02:05:12.723]  On the grasshoppers.
[02:05:12.723 --> 02:05:15.966]  But the grasshoppers will still sing the tune, if they can make money.
[02:05:15.966 --> 02:05:22.673]  But maybe you don't have a Hollywood mansion where you can drop another million dollars to turn your home theater into a radiation-proof bunker.
[02:05:22.673 --> 02:05:27.157]  There are still very effective, low-tech, low-cost things you can do to prepare.
[02:05:27.157 --> 02:05:34.564]  In fact, even realizing that there's a need to prepare and doing anything to act on that realization increases your chances of survival.
[02:05:34.924 --> 02:05:43.393]  Things that you do to prepare for an Armageddon scenario will help you to weather storms, to absorb an economic shock, or to protect you from home invasion.
[02:05:43.393 --> 02:05:49.359]  Prepare for the worst case scenario while you educate yourself and others and work for the best case scenario.

[02:08:04.559 --> 02:08:06.621]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[02:08:35.885 --> 02:08:36.126]  Yeah.
[02:08:49.896 --> 02:08:52.798]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're back live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:08:52.798 --> 02:08:55.100]  For the rest of the hour, Mark Dice is joining us.
[02:08:55.100 --> 02:08:58.642]  In fact, the last 20 minutes, I've got a family issue to attend to.
[02:08:58.642 --> 02:09:07.889]  He is going to be hosting, and then coming up in the fourth hour, we are going to have John Rapoport of nomorefakenews.com, always informative.
[02:09:07.889 --> 02:09:10.131]  So much news and information to cover, but wow!
[02:09:11.201 --> 02:09:17.269]  Mark Dice has been, I don't know, doing media stuff for at least 12, 13 years.
[02:09:17.269 --> 02:09:24.157]  He's got a degree in radio, television, film, and he's a media analyst, and he has millions of viewers a day.
[02:09:24.157 --> 02:09:26.960]  It's so exciting to see that he's always been successful.
[02:09:27.381 --> 02:09:27.561]  I don't
[02:09:47.657 --> 02:09:53.783]  Fake news and his trolling and his memes and just everything he does is just amazing.
[02:09:53.783 --> 02:09:57.387]  So it's so good to have him here with us for the hour.
[02:09:58.542 --> 02:10:04.785]  Mark, obviously I've got a lot of issues to cover and a lot of questions I have for you, but where do you want to start first?
[02:10:04.785 --> 02:10:08.006]  I mean, they're saying Matt Drudge is a Russian agent.
[02:10:08.006 --> 02:10:11.968]  They're saying Trump's racist because he talks about sovereignty.
[02:10:11.968 --> 02:10:16.310]  Brian Williams is back on TV, even though he's the king of fake news.
[02:10:16.310 --> 02:10:20.092]  You've got Kimmel saying he wants to beat people up.
[02:10:20.092 --> 02:10:20.892]  They're trying to invoke
[02:10:22.205 --> 02:10:23.607]  Assault on folks.
[02:10:23.607 --> 02:10:26.911]  I mean, we're in the middle of like a culture war, a civil war.
[02:10:26.911 --> 02:10:41.128]  What would you call this time and space we're in, A, and B, how is team sanity, team common sense, I would even call us conservatives, just team free market, team reality, how is team reality doing?
[02:10:42.779 --> 02:10:49.067]  I mean we're on the verge of an Orwellian nightmare where people are being disconnected from the truth so they don't even know which way is up.
[02:10:49.067 --> 02:10:59.962]  I've been doing this so long that I remember back in the day when Jimmy Kimmel was actually a comedian and now obviously he's just a liberal propagandist and we're seeing this strange attack against
[02:11:00.562 --> 02:11:00.702]  Okay.
[02:11:18.356 --> 02:11:36.943]  Coincidentally, or not coincidentally rather, coinciding with the rise of social media personalities, new independent companies using the social media technology, because Facebook transitioned from a social networking company into a news company when they introduced their trending topics.
[02:11:36.943 --> 02:11:44.046]  Now they suggest which stories they think people would be interested in, as opposed to people just sharing what they want to with their friends.
[02:11:44.647 --> 02:11:54.146]  And YouTube transitioned from a place to post funny cat videos or little clips of, you know, Charlie biting his brother's finger, if you may recall that viral video.
[02:11:55.006 --> 02:12:02.070]  To companies like you and personalities like me, who are now dominating the mainstream media.
[02:12:02.070 --> 02:12:06.933]  And it's not only just us, it's thousands of smaller, smaller channels.
[02:12:06.933 --> 02:12:09.734]  And so we're seeing some new censorship rolling out.
[02:12:09.734 --> 02:12:19.079]  They're trying to remove the financial incentives of people like me on YouTube, demonetizing virtually every one of our channels, every one of our videos.
[02:12:19.079 --> 02:12:22.041]  Their censorship is so specific now, Alex,
[02:12:23.362 --> 02:12:31.009]  Many people don't know this, but when someone uploads a video to YouTube, it's automatically transcribed, and you can actually go and see the transcript.
[02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:35.173]  So their AI transcribes what is said in the video.
[02:12:35.173 --> 02:12:44.020]  And so now, if you just talk about certain things in the video, it's automatically... Most of my videos now are demonetized as soon as I upload them.
[02:12:44.020 --> 02:12:45.562]  They're done processing.
[02:12:46.380 --> 02:12:48.021]  Immediately demonetized.
[02:12:48.021 --> 02:12:51.402]  Before any titles, before any tags, before any descriptions.
[02:12:51.402 --> 02:13:08.948]  So it used to be that if you were to, you know, title a video something having to do with terrorism or police or, you know, have some descriptions in there about, with some keywords that they felt were, you know, sensitive or violence or sexual content, they would automatically demonetize it.
[02:13:08.948 --> 02:13:15.811]  But now, it is off of what is actually said in the videos based off of their transcript.
[02:13:16.051 --> 02:13:22.776]  It's getting very scary because we're seeing them trying to remove websites, alternatives to Twitter, Gab, the social media network.
[02:13:22.776 --> 02:13:26.059]  I know you just had your CEO, Andrew Torba, on earlier this week.
[02:13:26.059 --> 02:13:30.563]  This is a very scary time and that's why it's not time to sit back and relax.
[02:13:30.563 --> 02:13:41.191]  We have to really triple our efforts because we may be in the last few months or years of the free internet that we've all or that many of us have grown up with.
[02:13:42.563 --> 02:13:44.025]  It's the best of times, worst of times.
[02:13:44.025 --> 02:13:46.347]  It's because you've been so effective.
[02:13:46.347 --> 02:13:47.428]  I've been so effective.
[02:13:47.428 --> 02:13:49.710]  Drudge has been so effective.
[02:13:49.710 --> 02:13:55.637]  All these thousands of new rising channels that reach hundreds of thousands a day, millions a week.
[02:13:55.637 --> 02:13:58.560]  The smaller channels, tens of millions a week like your channel.
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:00.081]  Same thing with our channels.
[02:14:00.081 --> 02:14:02.344]  And we're winning the culture war, so they're saying...
[02:14:02.904 --> 02:14:04.045]  We're going to censor you.
[02:14:04.045 --> 02:14:05.786]  We're going to demonetize you.
[02:14:05.786 --> 02:14:07.047]  And we're like, OK, take the money.
[02:14:07.047 --> 02:14:08.108]  And they're like, no, you don't understand.
[02:14:08.108 --> 02:14:10.370]  We're not going to let people really share your videos anymore.
[02:14:10.370 --> 02:14:13.332]  But despite that, people still hand-share our videos.
[02:14:13.332 --> 02:14:14.814]  They hand-share your videos.
[02:14:14.814 --> 02:14:16.835]  So still, we're rising.
[02:14:16.835 --> 02:14:17.996]  And the globalists are panicking.
[02:14:17.996 --> 02:14:32.208]  So as you know, last week Zuckerberg came out and said in the next year, he's going to spend $1 billion flooding not just Facebook, but YouTube everywhere with his own scientifically created stuff to target
[02:14:34.650 --> 02:14:38.794]  Facebook videos to try to dominate and basically jam everything.
[02:14:38.794 --> 02:14:46.361]  So they now understand the future is going to be factoid, quick, short videos like yours, like Paul Watson's.
[02:14:46.361 --> 02:14:57.531]  Google has also announced a program where they're going to be paying for, starting off, 1,000 journalists that they're going to have infiltrate eight news agencies
[02:14:59.701 --> 02:14:59.841]  Sure.
[02:15:20.868 --> 02:15:21.749]  The other 25%.
[02:15:21.749 --> 02:15:22.989]  And let's be clear, let's be clear.
[02:15:22.989 --> 02:15:25.151]  The Glenn Becks have been filled in on this plan.
[02:15:25.151 --> 02:15:37.558]  That's why he's totally Benedict Arnold, destroyed himself with his main audience, because he's been told we're going to shut down all the competition, we're going to flood things with fake conservative, conservative-oid garbage, but a bunch of liberal and establishment garbage.
[02:15:37.558 --> 02:15:47.984]  So their answer is they're going to flood everything with content trying to drown us out, and then they admit that that's actually their plan while they censor us, while they block us.
[02:15:48.484 --> 02:15:49.307]  While they attack us.
[02:15:49.307 --> 02:15:50.751]  This is an epic battle.
[02:15:50.751 --> 02:15:54.321]  So as you said, we may just have a few months of anything being left.
[02:15:55.669 --> 02:16:02.510]  YouTube also is paying and promoting and literally flying talent out to their headquarters to the YouTube Space LA.
[02:16:02.510 --> 02:16:04.871]  They've been doing this covertly for years.
[02:16:04.871 --> 02:16:19.294]  Social justice warriors who they're promoting, who they're giving funds to, who they're literally turning over their YouTube studios to and giving them a whole staff to help them produce their content in order to try to counter our message.
[02:16:19.294 --> 02:16:21.154]  Here's what one of the people involved with
[02:16:21.374 --> 02:16:35.125]  ...reporting for America had to say about Google's new plan to send, starting off a thousand journalists, again which they're going to crowdsource... And those will be fake news operatives that read talking points just to add more faces to it.
[02:16:35.125 --> 02:16:41.350]  That's their technique on CNN and MSNBC is panels with seven to ten people all making it look like it's a consensus.
[02:16:41.350 --> 02:16:45.314]  They're going to create focus group TV programs to create false consensus.
[02:16:46.288 --> 02:16:57.937]  They're trying to find what are called social media influencers, people who have a sizable social media following, so that they can then post their articles and have them go viral through their social media followings.
[02:16:57.937 --> 02:17:00.579]  And so here's what one of the guys affiliated with it says.
[02:17:00.579 --> 02:17:04.862]  It says it's going to be a rigorous and probably a pretty tough process to get in.
[02:17:05.342 --> 02:17:06.584]  Let's be clear, they always make it elitist.
[02:17:22.683 --> 02:17:25.786]  Have biometrics on your Mercedes when it's an enslavement system.
[02:17:25.786 --> 02:17:27.387]  So we clamor.
[02:17:27.387 --> 02:17:29.689]  We clamor to have Google give us money.
[02:17:29.689 --> 02:17:33.752]  But really what you're getting is Google not blocking you and Google embedding.
[02:17:33.752 --> 02:17:35.013]  And I don't want to get into this.
[02:17:35.013 --> 02:17:36.033]  It was behind the scenes.
[02:17:36.033 --> 02:17:37.274]  It was done privately.
[02:17:37.274 --> 02:17:39.576]  But I had Google six years ago reach out.
[02:17:39.576 --> 02:17:42.278]  I had Facebook two years ago reach out.
[02:17:42.278 --> 02:17:43.819]  And they just said, look, just stop.
[02:17:44.600 --> 02:17:45.721]  And we'll fly to New York.
[02:17:45.721 --> 02:17:47.742]  It was all just like out of a movie though.
[02:17:47.742 --> 02:17:51.944]  Just be a little more friendly and we're not going to unblock you.
[02:17:51.944 --> 02:17:53.024]  Or we're not going to block you.
[02:17:53.024 --> 02:17:55.586]  And then suddenly my videos were all getting two million.
[02:17:55.586 --> 02:17:58.267]  And then for like a month they go, oh, you're not being very friendly.
[02:17:58.267 --> 02:17:59.127]  And it's right back down to 100,000.
[02:17:59.127 --> 02:18:02.829]  And they weren't making me get the millions of views.
[02:18:02.829 --> 02:18:06.151]  They were unblocking me and letting me have my own success.
[02:18:06.151 --> 02:18:09.953]  So that's how this works is they literally just influence pedal.
[02:18:12.043 --> 02:18:21.446]  And they go on to say here that, well, the reporters will need to persuade us that they have both the skills and the character, a commitment to public service.
[02:18:21.446 --> 02:18:26.888]  They're doing a public service now to have an impact quality.
[02:18:26.888 --> 02:18:31.610]  What they're moving to is not YouTube, but YouTube and Facebook all have their own people.
[02:18:31.610 --> 02:18:36.452]  Everybody else is kicked off and only folks that are doing the service of the SJW can be on.
[02:18:37.737 --> 02:18:53.341]  Those are the ones that are going to be promoted, obviously, because a lot of people don't know this, but people who have Facebook fan pages, which is what all public figures have, or any band or any brand on Facebook, they limit the distribution unless you actually pay them to publish and distribute your posts.
[02:18:53.341 --> 02:18:58.223]  To reach everyone that subscribes to my page, I think it's about $5,000.
[02:18:59.992 --> 02:19:01.373]  Or one single post.
[02:19:01.373 --> 02:19:03.856]  So they don't want our information to be seen.
[02:19:03.856 --> 02:19:09.781]  So it's going to be this handheld, small group of social justice warrior chosen people to be promoted.
[02:19:09.781 --> 02:19:16.207]  And this is what they're trying to do to control the information, to control the narrative again, because they've absolutely lost it.
[02:19:16.207 --> 02:19:17.107]  They're freaking out.
[02:19:17.107 --> 02:19:23.093]  I see reports in mainstream media complaining about you and Paul Joseph Watson and other people on social media.
[02:19:23.093 --> 02:19:24.114]  I mean, almost every day now.
[02:19:24.414 --> 02:19:25.855]  They just don't even know what to do.
[02:19:25.855 --> 02:19:29.477]  And so, at some point, they're going to continue to clamp down.
[02:19:29.477 --> 02:19:34.939]  First, they're going for some of the more extremist, racist people and shutting their accounts down.
[02:19:34.939 --> 02:19:41.723]  And then they're just going to keep coming down and say, well, you know, Paul Joseph Watson, your anti-immigration video is pretty racist.
[02:19:41.723 --> 02:19:48.907]  Well, they've already demonetized all his videos and are now... They deleted hundreds of his videos just last year.
[02:19:48.907 --> 02:19:51.008]  Some videos were 37 million apiece.
[02:19:52.918 --> 02:19:54.819]  Fully cooked, ready-to-eat bacon.
[02:19:54.819 --> 02:19:58.041]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center-cut, presidential bacon.
[02:19:58.041 --> 02:19:59.642]  Savory and delicious.
[02:19:59.642 --> 02:20:02.483]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.

[02:24:04.105 --> 02:24:07.069]  You know, strange days have found us.
[02:24:07.069 --> 02:24:07.810]  Strange days are here.
[02:24:07.810 --> 02:24:10.513]  Mark Dice of MarkDice.com is here with us.
[02:24:10.513 --> 02:24:12.916]  I'm going to be carrying his new best-selling book.
[02:24:12.916 --> 02:24:13.837]  We know it's going to be best-selling.
[02:24:13.837 --> 02:24:19.203]  Many of his books have been best-sellers at InfoWarsTore.com as soon as that sucker comes out in about three months.
[02:24:19.203 --> 02:24:20.385]  I know some of the subjects.
[02:24:20.385 --> 02:24:21.526]  It's his biggest book.
[02:24:21.526 --> 02:24:23.409]  Can't wait to see that, especially now that his audience
[02:24:23.849 --> 02:24:24.770]  Is so huge.
[02:24:24.770 --> 02:24:26.672]  That makes me sleep better at night, folks.
[02:24:26.672 --> 02:24:33.179]  Knowing that Paul Watson's huge, and he's huge, and there's a lot of other big people now, because it's scary to be the one guy that's big.
[02:24:33.179 --> 02:24:40.047]  But getting back to Mark Dice, I watched him drinking coffee during the break, and it was the Jay Leno show, back when he was hosting.
[02:24:41.434 --> 02:24:45.356]  Jay Leno, I know for a fact, would have kept the show.
[02:24:45.356 --> 02:24:46.296]  He had higher ratings.
[02:24:46.296 --> 02:24:48.017]  The ratings dropped massively when he left.
[02:24:48.017 --> 02:24:50.738]  He would not just attack conservatives every night.
[02:24:50.738 --> 02:24:51.759]  He's not even a conservative.
[02:24:51.759 --> 02:24:52.979]  He's more like a libertarian.
[02:24:52.979 --> 02:24:54.020]  I know people that know him well.
[02:24:54.020 --> 02:24:55.220]  He's a listener of the show.
[02:24:55.220 --> 02:24:55.761]  He's a patriot.
[02:24:56.761 --> 02:25:00.263]  Jay Leno would not play ball, and so he's gone.
[02:25:00.263 --> 02:25:03.825]  That's why they have these complete hacks now, and it's weird.
[02:25:03.825 --> 02:25:07.827]  There's this paradox where they've got all these HBO shows, Showtime shows.
[02:25:07.827 --> 02:25:09.507]  I'm not talking about myself, but I have to.
[02:25:09.507 --> 02:25:24.335]  They have all these programs where they have Comedy Central shows where the person says they're me, says racist things, and then I don't get to respond because they go, oh, it's just comedy, while they censor me in the real world and try to shut me up, Mark Dice.
[02:25:25.776 --> 02:25:31.383]  You know, Leno was pushed out when he was number one for over 20 years, which doesn't make any sense in terms of the television business.
[02:25:31.383 --> 02:25:38.432]  You don't push somebody out when they are number one, when they've been number one, and there's no indication... I mean, I know people that know him.
[02:25:38.432 --> 02:25:39.394]  He's even kind of said it.
[02:25:39.394 --> 02:25:42.518]  He said he's not gonna sit there and divide America and be a big jerk.
[02:25:43.308 --> 02:25:47.653]  Well, he was the first late-night comedian to pull the gloves off and start going after Obama.
[02:25:47.653 --> 02:25:49.835]  And if you recall, I mean, everybody was really soft.
[02:25:49.835 --> 02:25:52.739]  Even the jokes about Obama, they were very light.
[02:25:52.739 --> 02:25:54.841]  They weren't even, you know, jabs at him.
[02:25:54.841 --> 02:25:58.986]  They were just sort of jokes about him, the administration, all to make him look like a good guy.
[02:25:59.566 --> 02:26:08.032]  And then after, I don't remember exactly what point it was, but after the Hope and Change started wearing off and turned into, you know, regret and despair, Leno took the gloves off.
[02:26:08.032 --> 02:26:13.716]  And I remember, because I was a big Leno fan, when he started making very serious jokes about it.
[02:26:13.716 --> 02:26:15.638]  He started tearing Obama up and they fired him.
[02:26:16.650 --> 02:26:19.914]  They got rid of him, and you know, the comedians are propagandists.
[02:26:19.914 --> 02:26:33.969]  I mean, I think it was Time Magazine or Newsweek even dubbed what they're calling the John Oliver effect, in that John Oliver's audience is a politically active group, and that John Oliver uses his platform, obviously, not just as comedy, which I guess you could call it comedy to some.
[02:26:34.349 --> 02:26:49.200]  But as a political activist organization, and so they actually are calling his political agenda the John Oliver Effect, because he's having such a powerful effect on various legislation and on our culture.
[02:26:49.200 --> 02:26:51.201]  That's why this is a culture war.
[02:26:51.201 --> 02:26:54.684]  That's why I'm excited in a couple months to promote the new book.
[02:26:55.419 --> 02:27:06.705]  It's going to be so good and that's why I'm so glad to see InfoWords grow from such a, you know, from a basic operation to what it is now because it's so crucial that we counter this propaganda that they're putting out on a daily basis.
[02:27:06.705 --> 02:27:09.586]  I don't know what they're going to do because they're losing so many viewers.
[02:27:09.586 --> 02:27:11.247]  Nobody's watching the NFL anymore.
[02:27:11.247 --> 02:27:12.688]  Nobody's watching these award shows.
[02:27:12.688 --> 02:27:15.349]  I was about to say the NFL has record low viewers.
[02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:19.852]  All of them are imploding because we're sick of being beat over the head with SJW.
[02:27:19.852 --> 02:27:21.853]  Where do you in your gut see all this ending?
[02:27:23.635 --> 02:27:34.842]  You know, I think it's just going to turn into more of a Huxley and Circus, where I think they're going to just start basically bribing people with lottery-type winnings to watch shows, sort of like you do on your local radio shows.
[02:27:34.842 --> 02:27:38.924]  You know, oh, the 10th caller gets free tickets to, you know, go to such-and-such a concert.
[02:27:39.144 --> 02:27:46.047]  I think they're going to just start offering people money, or they're going to have to offer people chances to come and hang out with your favorite celebrity.
[02:27:46.047 --> 02:27:47.788]  Oh, come and hang out with Jimmy Kimmel!
[02:27:47.788 --> 02:27:51.550]  Just watch the show and, you know, text in and you're going to be chosen.
[02:27:51.550 --> 02:27:54.451]  I'm not sure what they're going to do because their audiences have dwindled.
[02:27:54.451 --> 02:28:01.794]  They made a slight comeback, the liberal cable news channels, since the election, before the election season, back in like 2014.
[02:28:03.195 --> 02:28:05.156]  They could barely get 150,000 viewers.
[02:28:05.156 --> 02:28:08.038]  Sure, and that dead cat bounce is now wearing off.
[02:28:08.038 --> 02:28:18.164]  But they also have this UN phenomenon where the globalists control all the money and then have these big robot factories where they're going to, quote, give everybody free money, a basic monthly income.
[02:28:18.164 --> 02:28:22.867]  But to do that, you've got to sign on to the government's SJW agenda.
[02:28:22.867 --> 02:28:26.229]  Just like, oh, you'll have a YouTube site and we'll pay you now.
[02:28:26.229 --> 02:28:29.451]  We're demonetizing everybody else for real success.
[02:28:29.451 --> 02:28:30.592]  No one gets money unless you
[02:28:31.877 --> 02:28:33.302]  Prescribe to our code of ethics.
[02:28:34.738 --> 02:28:46.648]  Yeah, and they'll start banning people just like Patreon, sort of an alternative funding mechanism for content creators, YouTubers, banned Lauren Southern, just a conservative YouTuber, because they just didn't like what she was doing.
[02:28:46.648 --> 02:28:49.711]  They violated their, she violated their terms of service.
[02:28:49.711 --> 02:28:53.113]  That's why relying on this technology is quite dangerous.
[02:28:53.113 --> 02:28:55.075]  It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.
[02:28:55.075 --> 02:29:01.601]  Double-edged sword, because it's amazing what we're able to do, but at the same time, at any point, they can completely cut us off, shut us off.
[02:29:01.601 --> 02:29:02.381]  And let's go further!
[02:29:03.482 --> 02:29:11.747]  Clearly they say that they're this combine, they're this utility, so everybody can be there, but then they discriminate against us.
[02:29:11.747 --> 02:29:22.314]  But now, banning Gab, kicking them off Google platforms for apps, foreign governments kicking them off just because they're a truly open place for people to talk.
[02:29:23.274 --> 02:29:36.162]  It's next level with Google and Facebook and Twitter, Mark, as you know, supporting government platforms, supporting Saudi Arabia and Iran, giving them the intel at Twitter on blasphemers of Islam to kill them.
[02:29:36.162 --> 02:29:41.885]  It shows they're ready to climb in bed with any authoritarianism as fast as they can jump in that dirty bed.
[02:29:41.885 --> 02:29:42.345]  We'll be back.
[02:29:42.345 --> 02:29:43.646]  We're on the march.
[02:29:43.646 --> 02:29:46.187]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:46.187 --> 02:29:48.849]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:54.048 --> 02:30:07.123]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called stingrays, which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[02:30:08.410 --> 02:30:20.393]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI, who have forced our nation's police departments into signing non-disclosure agreements, forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:30:20.393 --> 02:30:36.677]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment, and they have no legal authority for warrantless stingray spying, where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:30:37.137 --> 02:30:42.120]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming, it's already here.
[02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:46.383]  This is Darren McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance.
[02:30:46.383 --> 02:30:47.764]  InfoWars.com.
[02:30:52.955 --> 02:30:54.835]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[02:30:54.835 --> 02:30:56.856]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[02:30:56.856 --> 02:30:59.777]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[02:30:59.777 --> 02:31:05.838]  The artificial particulates, the chemicals, is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[02:31:05.838 --> 02:31:15.020]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure groundbreaking water filtration systems have now developed Alexa Pure Breathe.
[02:31:15.020 --> 02:31:18.301]  Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your co-workers,
[02:31:18.561 --> 02:31:22.548]  Your family, your children, do the best job you can to purify your air.
[02:31:22.548 --> 02:31:30.601]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[02:31:30.601 --> 02:31:31.683]  The general public doesn't.
[02:31:32.757 --> 02:31:36.698]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[02:31:36.698 --> 02:31:40.279]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:40.279 --> 02:31:46.982]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:46.982 --> 02:31:51.143]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:53.536 --> 02:31:58.262]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:31:58.262 --> 02:32:08.635]  And in the last four or five years, doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases,
[02:32:08.695 --> 02:32:17.959]  Infowars had much better nutrition than we do today, and our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[02:32:17.959 --> 02:32:31.945]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken, but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:32:31.945 --> 02:32:34.326]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalists.
[02:32:34.326 --> 02:32:37.847]  We're getting results, and we're expanding in the face of
[02:32:37.927 --> 02:32:38.167]  We're good.
[02:33:03.717 --> 02:33:17.941]  From the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.941 --> 02:33:18.941]  The Unknown Soldier.
[02:33:18.941 --> 02:33:23.463]  All right, Mark Dice is taking over for five minutes in the next hour.
[02:33:23.463 --> 02:33:26.364]  Then John Rutherford is going to be hosting the full fourth hour.
[02:33:26.364 --> 02:33:27.344]  Before I go any further,
[02:33:28.345 --> 02:33:34.166]  I had one other clip I wanted to play for Mark Dice, but we were just talking during the break about how crazy this is.
[02:33:34.166 --> 02:33:40.868]  And I remember back when Kim Dotcom was in the news and he was saying, oh, Hillary's Christmas presents are coming.
[02:33:40.868 --> 02:33:41.928]  Oh, it's over for you.
[02:33:41.928 --> 02:33:44.469]  Assange is going to release the motherlode.
[02:33:44.469 --> 02:33:45.929]  And then I was talking to all these journalists.
[02:33:45.929 --> 02:33:52.811]  I mean, Assange was doing London Guardian interviews, Fox News interviews, New York Times interviews back then.
[02:33:52.811 --> 02:33:56.812]  And then they acted like Roger Stone trying to talk to him was proof that he was a Russian agent.
[02:33:57.808 --> 02:33:59.271]  As if there's proof that Assange is.
[02:33:59.271 --> 02:34:01.655]  It was just so many degrees of baloney.
[02:34:01.655 --> 02:34:09.769]  And I remember talking to, I'm not going to name the reporters, but talking to Stone at the RNC and even other events before that.
[02:34:10.815 --> 02:34:12.597]  Here, let me meet with this New York Times reporter.
[02:34:12.597 --> 02:34:15.699]  She talked to Assange today and he was obsessed with Assange.
[02:34:15.699 --> 02:34:21.803]  Hey, I'm trying to, a Guardian reporter that I know is going to be going in next week and maybe he's going to get my question into her.
[02:34:21.803 --> 02:34:24.005]  I mean, into him.
[02:34:24.005 --> 02:34:30.570]  That's the Russia investigation on Roger Stone that he tried to talk to Julian Assange.
[02:34:30.570 --> 02:34:31.330]  Everybody was.
[02:34:31.330 --> 02:34:34.613]  I mean, we sent him probably 50 emails asking him to come on.
[02:34:34.613 --> 02:34:35.914]  Does that mean I'm a Russian agent?
[02:34:36.514 --> 02:34:43.457]  How come the New York Times can interview Julian Assange, but if I try to, Mark Dice, I'm a Russian agent?
[02:34:43.457 --> 02:34:46.318]  I think this is one of their final steps in trying to shut us down.
[02:34:46.318 --> 02:34:49.980]  First they accused us of being all a bunch of alt-right white supremacists.
[02:34:49.980 --> 02:34:51.901]  That totally didn't work, backfired.
[02:34:51.901 --> 02:34:56.603]  I got several reports to issue retractions after they defamed me, accusing me of that.
[02:34:56.603 --> 02:34:58.544]  Then they call us all a bunch of Russian agents.
[02:34:58.544 --> 02:34:59.784]  Doesn't really work.
[02:34:59.784 --> 02:35:02.806]  Then they try to demonetize our channels.
[02:35:02.806 --> 02:35:03.506]  We're still going.
[02:35:04.016 --> 02:35:07.337]  Then they try to just get us shut down for terms of service violations.
[02:35:07.337 --> 02:35:11.158]  Now we're seeing other alternative, decentralized systems popping up.
[02:35:11.158 --> 02:35:13.219]  The Streisand effect is working.
[02:35:13.219 --> 02:35:15.379]  It's just bringing more attention to our cause.
[02:35:15.379 --> 02:35:18.680]  So then they go for, I mean, really one step beyond just assassinations.
[02:35:18.680 --> 02:35:23.602]  And that is to try to just sue people or get them to be investigated criminally, which
[02:35:24.342 --> 02:35:30.429]  I mean, it could be $50,000 a month just to defend a basic lawsuit, just to get a lawsuit thrown out.
[02:35:30.429 --> 02:35:31.750]  I mean, it could be $5,000.
[02:35:31.750 --> 02:35:33.051]  It's just outrageous.
[02:35:33.051 --> 02:35:36.055]  And so they know that they can bankrupt people.
[02:35:36.055 --> 02:35:41.340]  You know, I just read a report that Roger Stone had accumulated a half a million dollars in legal fees or is expecting
[02:35:41.360 --> 02:35:41.800]  I think so.
[02:35:59.508 --> 02:36:04.473]  But not everybody can respond or could afford tens of thousands of dollars a month in lawsuits.
[02:36:04.473 --> 02:36:05.915]  So it's very, very important.
[02:36:05.915 --> 02:36:08.017]  We're in really, really critical times right now.
[02:36:08.017 --> 02:36:09.299]  Quite a scary time.
[02:36:09.299 --> 02:36:11.721]  Quite exciting, though, to see what's happening now.
[02:36:11.721 --> 02:36:14.404]  But it's definitely not the time to fall asleep at the wheel.
[02:36:14.404 --> 02:36:21.271]  Again, Mark Dice of markdice.com, bestselling author, commentator, filmmaker, you name it, joining us right now.
[02:36:22.355 --> 02:36:31.045]  Historically, if a country's even quasi-free, shutdown of the press and shutdown of voices turns them into superstars.
[02:36:31.045 --> 02:36:35.850]  And all their attempts at censorship, I mean, what, they banned your YouTube channel already, was it six, seven years ago?
[02:36:35.850 --> 02:36:37.071]  Then again a few years ago?
[02:36:37.071 --> 02:36:38.353]  That only made you bigger.
[02:36:38.353 --> 02:36:39.033]  Same thing with us.
[02:36:40.464 --> 02:36:44.887]  So I don't understand, don't they get now that they admit they want to ban us?
[02:36:44.887 --> 02:36:49.170]  And then Hillary attacks me seven times in her book.
[02:36:49.170 --> 02:36:51.071]  She attacked me again last week.
[02:36:51.071 --> 02:36:56.135]  Don't they understand that when they call us dark heart and evil, that people know she's evil.
[02:36:56.135 --> 02:37:02.339]  So even folks that didn't know who I was, they're coming to newswars.com, infowars.com to find out what all the hubbub is.
[02:37:03.965 --> 02:37:10.369]  When I heard Hillary Clinton call you out by name during a speech, my jaw just dropped because it was a tremendous gift that she gave you.
[02:37:10.369 --> 02:37:14.592]  And I knew that you were going to put that clip into your bumpers because it's hilarious.
[02:37:14.592 --> 02:37:15.612]  It's really an honor.
[02:37:15.612 --> 02:37:19.635]  You know, sometimes they say that you can judge a man based off of the size of their enemies.
[02:37:20.175 --> 02:37:25.576]  And you can't have much of a more sinister, well-connected enemy than Hillary Clinton.
[02:37:25.576 --> 02:37:27.857]  But I think they really do have a mass mental illness.
[02:37:27.857 --> 02:37:31.578]  They don't even know what to do, because the fact that she's out with her new book is just ridiculous.
[02:37:31.578 --> 02:37:38.239]  I mean, most of the people in the... And she shows how crazy, exactly, even her own liberals go, you sound like a whacked out nut!
[02:37:38.239 --> 02:37:40.120]  And you're blaming everybody but yourself!
[02:37:41.653 --> 02:37:43.574]  She's, yeah, she, she, everybody but herself.
[02:37:43.574 --> 02:37:48.376]  I mean, from WikiLeaks to the Russians to you to fake news to Facebook, it's, it's ridiculous.
[02:37:48.376 --> 02:37:51.257]  And you even have people who really like her, but they're trying to be nice to her.
[02:37:51.257 --> 02:37:52.998]  I mean, she was on Stephen Colbert's show the other day.
[02:37:52.998 --> 02:37:57.160]  I just saw, saw a clip online and he even said... They're like toasting champagne?
[02:37:58.737 --> 02:38:02.979]  He even said to her, though, he said, a lot of people are, you know, asking, you know, why don't you just go away?
[02:38:02.979 --> 02:38:07.262]  And you can see her facial expressions during her interviews are just bizarre.
[02:38:07.262 --> 02:38:10.043]  I mean, she looks just totally whacked out of her mind.
[02:38:10.043 --> 02:38:14.626]  She looks like she needs to be sedated, or she probably is sedated.
[02:38:14.626 --> 02:38:18.248]  Well, by the way, I was told by our sources, and that's why I have Chardonnay up there as a joke,
[02:38:19.008 --> 02:38:24.072]  That she was falling down drunk election night, throwing things at people, and I got that from the Secret Service.
[02:38:24.072 --> 02:38:27.474]  Just like they told us she was collapsing every 45 minutes, and a month later was caught on tape.
[02:38:27.474 --> 02:38:29.716]  I mean, these are real sources.
[02:38:29.716 --> 02:38:33.158]  She was expecting to win, so she didn't have a concession speech written.
[02:38:33.158 --> 02:38:39.903]  That's why they had to wait until the very next day to come out and admit defeat, because it's breaking tradition.
[02:38:39.903 --> 02:38:43.366]  Everybody has a concession speech written, because you just don't know what's going to happen.
[02:38:43.366 --> 02:38:44.166]  It's part of the plan.
[02:38:44.166 --> 02:38:47.809]  When you're one of the top two contenders, you plan for anything to happen.
[02:38:48.229 --> 02:38:49.951]  They didn't even have a concession.
[02:39:06.673 --> 02:39:08.054]  Her soul is definitely twisted.
[02:39:08.054 --> 02:39:10.535]  I mean, this is, just look at her face.
[02:39:10.535 --> 02:39:21.062]  This is the kind of torment that someone is experiencing when they lose a spouse or when they come down with a serious illness that's going to get them in a few months.
[02:39:21.062 --> 02:39:31.788]  I think that part of this is a strategy from them to try to portray her as being strong, to try to pretend like if she just, you know, she's not going to go away because if she just disappeared,
[02:39:32.428 --> 02:39:33.228]  I'm in the wiretaps!
[02:39:56.394 --> 02:39:59.659]  Law enforcement was so upset they gave me the secret wiretaps.
[02:39:59.659 --> 02:40:03.204]  And let me tell you, it's my private number, it's Trump's private numbers, it's real.
[02:40:03.204 --> 02:40:04.706]  Notice the media never touched that either, Mark.
[02:40:05.868 --> 02:40:23.202]  Let's not forget that the CIA admitted that they actually hacked into the Senate Intelligence Committee's computers when the Senate Intelligence Committee was investigating the torture and interrogation, the enhanced interrogation techniques during the Bush administration.
[02:40:23.202 --> 02:40:24.743]  And so they fully admit this.
[02:40:24.743 --> 02:40:32.570]  This is, I mean, the Senate Intelligence Committee is the group of congressmen who are given classified material and have a high-level authority
[02:40:33.388 --> 02:40:39.252]  To monitor the CIA, to make sure that they're not doing anything illegal.
[02:40:39.252 --> 02:40:57.002]  The CIA was spying on them to see what they knew, just like they did to Cheryl Atkinson, former ABC reporter, CBS reporter, when they admit the CIA was hacking into her computer, CBS admits this, when she was investigating Benghazi.
[02:40:57.382 --> 02:40:59.324]  Because they wanted to know her sources.
[02:40:59.324 --> 02:41:02.746]  They wanted to know what she knew, who she was talking to.
[02:41:02.746 --> 02:41:07.689]  I mean, this is third-world-level dictatorship tactics.
[02:41:07.689 --> 02:41:14.694]  Oh, I can't tell you how many times it comes out in the newspaper that some guests I've had on had their computer hacked into in ours.
[02:41:15.655 --> 02:41:24.859]  For the CIA, and then it's given to the FBI, and then there they are in federal court, using it against somebody in a federal court, and I've been spied on, and I learned, no warrant!
[02:41:24.859 --> 02:41:27.600]  They even use this stuff in court with no warrants!
[02:41:27.600 --> 02:41:31.422]  And then they go on the news and act like, oh, it's not happening.
[02:41:31.422 --> 02:41:35.384]  I mean, I've been sitting there before, because the CIA, different groups have been calling me up and stuff.
[02:41:36.384 --> 02:41:37.606]  I'm not going to get into it on air.
[02:41:37.606 --> 02:41:39.188]  It's just a total wreck.
[02:41:39.188 --> 02:41:44.173]  And the thing is, I don't want to kiss the CIA's butt, but there are a lot of patriots even in the CIA.
[02:41:44.173 --> 02:41:49.820]  But it's the globalists, it's the socialists that infest the schools, the corporations, the deep state.
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:50.861]  There's a civil war there.
[02:41:51.161 --> 02:41:53.522]  Mark Dice is taking over here in one minute.
[02:41:53.522 --> 02:41:54.643]  Please support his great work.
[02:41:54.643 --> 02:41:56.544]  Find his books at markdice.com.
[02:41:56.544 --> 02:42:02.587]  You may already know all this information, but your friends and family and neighbors don't, and they're finally ready to listen right now.
[02:42:02.587 --> 02:42:04.388]  So make hay while the sun shines.
[02:42:04.388 --> 02:42:07.670]  Follow him on YouTube at Mark Dice as well.
[02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:14.514]  1,119,000 subscribers just on that channel, despite the fact they've made him start over twice, deleting his channel twice, if the memory serves.
[02:42:14.514 --> 02:42:15.655]  I'll ask him in a minute, but briefly.
[02:42:17.232 --> 02:42:19.853]  50% off the highest quality storable foods out there.
[02:42:19.853 --> 02:42:21.513]  Fresh, the last 25 years.
[02:42:21.513 --> 02:42:24.774]  Vacuum sealed in the big plastic tote containers from MyPatriot.
[02:42:24.774 --> 02:42:26.414]  Promo code READY at checkout.
[02:42:26.414 --> 02:42:29.115]  Gets you 50% off instead of 10% off.
[02:42:29.115 --> 02:42:32.215]  I'm extending it because of the Mexico earthquake and all the rest of the crises.
[02:42:32.215 --> 02:42:33.976]  They've authorized me to do this.
[02:42:33.976 --> 02:42:36.856]  I was going to end it this weekend, but they said, no, you can keep going.
[02:42:36.856 --> 02:42:38.397]  But they don't want to slow down their production.
[02:42:38.397 --> 02:42:39.717]  They ship within days of your order.
[02:42:40.077 --> 02:42:42.638]  So they start slowing things down because the orders are so high.
[02:42:42.638 --> 02:42:44.359]  This sale will end in the next few days.
[02:42:44.359 --> 02:42:45.619]  It may go for another week.
[02:42:45.619 --> 02:42:47.100]  A week maximum.
[02:42:47.100 --> 02:42:48.940]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:42:48.940 --> 02:42:50.801]  All of the fluoride-free super blue.
[02:42:54.577 --> 02:42:55.498]  I think so.
[02:43:13.510 --> 02:43:17.012]  We have still a lot more to fund ourselves, so thank you all for the support.
[02:43:17.012 --> 02:43:22.175]  Now, back to the one, the only, media critic, author, and researcher, Mark Dice.
[02:43:22.175 --> 02:43:29.960]  He'll host Five Minutes the next hour, and then John Rapoport, exposing fake news, is coming up straight ahead.
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:31.941]  Now, let's go right back to Mark Dice.
[02:43:33.737 --> 02:43:41.462]  You know, we're talking about the wiretaps with Paul Manafort in Trump Tower, and they're saying Trump may have been collected on those wiretaps.
[02:43:41.462 --> 02:43:44.083]  They actually haven't just specifically wiretapped him.
[02:43:44.083 --> 02:43:53.549]  I mean, Edward Snowden, back four years ago when he released his treasure trove of NSA documents in 2013, revealed a program called Project Mystic.
[02:43:53.549 --> 02:43:55.030]  And again, this is four years old.
[02:43:55.030 --> 02:43:57.912]  Who knows how old those documents were at the time that he even obtained them.
[02:43:58.536 --> 02:44:06.882]  Where the NSA was recording every phone call in an entire country on a 30-day buffer, okay?
[02:44:06.882 --> 02:44:17.851]  So they literally have a program, and again, with the advances in technology, in four years, this is most likely the entire globe's conversations.
[02:44:18.721 --> 02:44:20.803]  On a 30-day buffer four years ago.
[02:44:20.803 --> 02:44:33.013]  So every single phone call that was made in an entire country, audio recorded, transcribed and put into a text file most likely, so it can be searchable like Google.
[02:44:33.013 --> 02:44:38.157]  So it's not even just someone that is targeted specifically for a wiretap.
[02:44:38.157 --> 02:44:43.722]  They theoretically and most likely can go back and find any conversation
[02:44:44.042 --> 02:44:55.810]  from any person from the last several years and then do a keyword search on it to find out specifically who is talking to who and what was said at any given time.
[02:44:55.810 --> 02:44:57.631]  That's how scary this is.
[02:44:57.631 --> 02:44:59.052]  That's the Orwellian nightmare.
[02:44:59.052 --> 02:45:02.134]  This is what Edward Snowden tried to talk about.
[02:45:02.134 --> 02:45:06.637]  And it's important to really bring home that the fake news industry, the mainstream media,
[02:45:07.375 --> 02:45:12.479]  They've been manipulated by the establishment, by the deep state, for decades.
[02:45:12.479 --> 02:45:32.412]  In the 1970s, there was a congressional hearing which was investigating the CIA doing assassinations and all sorts of other illegal activities, and then inadvertently uncovered Operation Mockingbird, which was the program to pay the mainstream media under the table to act as gatekeepers and propagandists for the establishment.
[02:45:32.412 --> 02:45:33.473]  Fifty, at least,
[02:45:34.810 --> 02:45:35.491]  C.I.A.
[02:45:35.491 --> 02:45:47.456]  agents or journalists, editors, C.E.O.s were in this program, half of which the Congressional Committee admits were paid by the C.I.A.
[02:45:47.456 --> 02:45:49.777]  One of the people involved with Operation Mockingbird
[02:45:50.478 --> 02:45:50.558]  It's
[02:46:20.478 --> 02:46:21.039]  We're good to go.
[02:46:39.068 --> 02:46:40.189]  So it's so important.
[02:46:40.189 --> 02:46:41.370]  That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[02:46:41.370 --> 02:46:49.014]  I mean, at some point, they'll probably have the web browsers, Firefox, Chrome, etc.
[02:46:49.014 --> 02:46:53.157]  just block InfoWars.com or other websites.
[02:46:53.157 --> 02:47:02.243]  And that's why some of these public, you know, some of these social media services really need to be regulated as if they are public utilities, because
[02:47:03.514 --> 02:47:27.550]  Twitter or Facebook or an internet registrar shutting down a website or shutting down your account or even censoring a particular post or a video on YouTube would be the equivalent of the phone company listening to every conversation that you and your friends have and then canceling your service if they just didn't like what it was that you were saying.
[02:47:27.550 --> 02:47:29.632]  And this would be like the post office
[02:47:30.453 --> 02:47:46.996]  If you were sending out your own magazine or a newsletter like people used to do back in the 1980s and the 1990s before the internet sort of took over that, it would be like the post office deciding not to deliver your magazine anymore because they just didn't like what it said.
[02:47:48.284 --> 02:48:09.282]  It's it's this is the level of censorship that we're at now and this is why we it's more important than ever to get involved to keep spreading this information instead of following websites through social media to just bookmark them directly and visit them directly to sign up for the email lists so that you can get the newsletters that way.
[02:48:09.282 --> 02:48:10.624]  I mean just imagine if
[02:48:12.319 --> 02:48:17.163]  Let's say the Postal Service, again, were to shut down specific magazines.
[02:48:17.163 --> 02:48:18.905]  Well, we just don't like what you're saying.
[02:48:18.905 --> 02:48:24.950]  That is exactly what these social media companies are doing when they're censoring people.
[02:48:24.950 --> 02:48:28.332]  So we've been documenting the fake news.
[02:48:28.332 --> 02:48:31.675]  Alex has been doing it for probably 15, 16 years.
[02:48:31.675 --> 02:48:36.199]  And so it's important to bring some previous examples to the forefront.
[02:48:36.199 --> 02:48:40.122]  Previous examples, most of the fake news, let's face it, comes from the mainstream media.
[02:48:40.683 --> 02:48:44.084]  I mean, they're the ones that have the major distribution channels.
[02:48:44.084 --> 02:48:46.705]  They're the ones who most people believe.
[02:48:46.705 --> 02:49:03.170]  So we've seen fake news from major networks like NBC News blowing up a GM truck and setting lit flares underneath the car and ramming it into it back in the 1990s during an investigation into faulty gas tanks from General Motors trucks.
[02:49:03.170 --> 02:49:04.711]  They were sued by GM.
[02:49:05.311 --> 02:49:07.753]  And had to admit that they staged the explosion.
[02:49:07.753 --> 02:49:18.443]  They put a fake gas cap on the gas tank, put lit flares underneath the car, rammed it into a truck, and then gas spilled out of the gas tank and it exploded.
[02:49:18.443 --> 02:49:24.688]  And they were, again, trying to investigate a real concern about faulty gas tanks on certain Model G on trucks.
[02:49:24.688 --> 02:49:26.950]  But they staged an explosion and it went viral.
[02:49:26.950 --> 02:49:30.033]  Everybody started freaking out about this, you know, dangerous gas tank.
[02:49:30.768 --> 02:49:43.641]  Well, GM sued, found the vehicles that were in the junkyard, had them analyzed forensically and determined that, and then NBC News later admitted, that they staged the whole thing.
[02:49:43.641 --> 02:49:45.883]  This is on a supposed news channel.
[02:49:45.883 --> 02:49:51.969]  I mean, many of you may recall a hilarious kind of example on, I think it was NBC,
[02:49:52.833 --> 02:50:09.051]  Another NBC or maybe this was ABC during a flood and they went to a live shot and they showed a reporter in a canoe and it looked like there was six seven feet of water in the middle of a suburb and then a couple of guys came walking along and the water was ankle-deep.
[02:50:09.051 --> 02:50:11.473]  Okay, this is fake news.
[02:50:11.473 --> 02:50:14.797]  Fake news is when Newsweek, big trusted publication,
[02:50:15.382 --> 02:50:27.312]  ...puts out a story about American soldiers flushing Qurans down the toilet in attempts to taunt detainees at Camp X-Ray.
[02:50:27.312 --> 02:50:33.538]  And then it causes riots and deaths in multiple Middle Eastern countries based off of a fake news story.
[02:50:33.538 --> 02:50:34.679]  We'll be back after the break.
[02:50:34.679 --> 02:50:36.060]  I'm Marc Deist, sitting in for Alex Jones.

[02:54:10.854 --> 02:54:13.515]  ...continuing exposing their fake news machine.
[02:54:13.515 --> 02:54:17.056]  Fake news, obviously, as we covered last segment, dates back decades.
[02:54:17.056 --> 02:54:24.938]  But in the last, really, year, last several months, they've ramped up their operation, trying to shut down the real news, trying to shut down networks like this.
[02:54:24.938 --> 02:54:27.299]  When we have ABC News, which was sued...
[02:54:27.939 --> 02:54:40.134]  For a hundred, actually they were sued for billions of dollars, but they settled for, I think it was $175 million for putting out series of fake news stories that helped to almost bankrupt an entire industry.
[02:54:40.134 --> 02:54:44.700]  Many of you may recall the pink slime scare.
[02:54:45.635 --> 02:55:07.854]  And so that was about a meat-producing plant and they showed, you know, some of the food processing before it reaches the grocery store and it looked a little bit strange and they coined this term pink slime and it scared so many people away from buying beef from this company that it almost bankrupted them and so they sued for several billion dollars.
[02:55:07.854 --> 02:55:08.935]  ABC settled
[02:55:09.455 --> 02:55:18.223]  For what was the equivalent of an entire year of their profits because of fake news from ABC.
[02:55:18.223 --> 02:55:24.729]  CBS, the flagship station of 60 Minutes, the hard-hitting investigation show.
[02:55:24.729 --> 02:55:28.213]  Many of you may recall a few months ago they did a segment about fake news.
[02:55:29.193 --> 02:55:35.039]  And the examples that they used of fake news websites weren't even fake news.
[02:55:35.039 --> 02:55:40.524]  They were parody websites, satire websites, like The Onion.
[02:55:40.524 --> 02:55:49.252]  Nobody in their right mind would read any of the examples, or most of the examples that they showed, and think, oh, that's fake news.
[02:55:49.252 --> 02:55:49.953]  They're literally
[02:55:50.563 --> 02:55:55.024]  A parody of real news showing parodies as fake news.
[02:55:55.024 --> 02:56:05.206]  One of the stories was a headline about how Donald Trump, after having a colonoscopy, had a brain tumor discovered.
[02:56:05.206 --> 02:56:06.927]  Well, get the joke?
[02:56:06.927 --> 02:56:12.528]  You know, they're looking in his rear end and they find where his brain is up his butt and they find a brain tumor.
[02:56:12.528 --> 02:56:18.409]  That's an example that CBS used on 60 Minutes as fake news.
[02:56:19.170 --> 02:56:40.429]  Meanwhile, the parody Twitter account of the administrative arm of North Korea has duped countless mainstream publications from USA Today and an array of other ones into reporting fake news because they can't tell that it's a parody Twitter account
[02:56:41.041 --> 02:56:43.883]  From North Korea's government.
[02:56:43.883 --> 02:57:00.533]  Just for years now, this fake DPRK account just tweets out ridiculous statements, as if they're coming from North Korea, that anybody should be able to tell is a parody, and publications keep reporting it as if it's real news.
[02:57:00.533 --> 02:57:07.437]  I mean, we saw a parody Twitter account of Michael Flynn, again that wasn't verified, had no followers,
[02:57:08.620 --> 02:57:17.067]  Being quoted by Nancy Pelosi as evidence of the Russia conspiracy after he was forced out.
[02:57:17.067 --> 02:57:21.611]  The fake Michael Flynn Twitter account tweeted out that this is, you know, this is a big conspiracy.
[02:57:21.611 --> 02:57:23.652]  I'm a patsy, he said.
[02:57:23.652 --> 02:57:34.501]  And so Nancy Pelosi quoted that at a press conference and then Dan Rather posted a big diatribe on his Facebook page about how this is bigger than Watergate.
[02:57:35.430 --> 02:57:44.576]  Dan Rather, of course, was really forced out of CBS News after their fake news during the Bush administration about fake documents that they said
