[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:06.000 --> 00:07.000]  We think. Just let me think.
[00:07.000 --> 00:08.000]  Let me think.
[00:08.000 --> 00:13.000]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will still be on their way.
[00:13.000 --> 00:14.000]  It's chances that...
[00:14.000 --> 00:15.000]  Damn it!
[00:15.000 --> 00:16.000]  Why?
[00:16.000 --> 00:22.000]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[00:22.000 --> 00:28.000]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the annunciations of truth.
[00:28.000 --> 00:33.000]  But the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:33.000 --> 00:37.000]  You decided, sir. You wanted it foolproof. You told me every television in London.
[00:37.000 --> 00:41.000]  Cruelty and intolerance and oppression.
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  And where once you have the freedom to object, just let everything speak as you saw fit,
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  you now have sensors and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and submachine.
[00:50.000 --> 00:51.000]  Cameras.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  How did this happen?
[00:53.000 --> 00:55.000]  Who's to blame?
[00:55.000 --> 00:58.000]  Certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  They will be held accountable.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:06.000 --> 01:11.000]  I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who would it be?
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  War, terror, disease?
[01:14.000 --> 01:20.000]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:20.000 --> 01:26.000]  Fear got the best of you. And in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:26.000 --> 01:29.000]  He promised you order. He promised you peace.
[01:29.000 --> 01:33.000]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:39.000 --> 01:43.000]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity. The time to choose sides has come.
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[01:57.000 --> 02:02.000]  And that intro that we just played is almost four years old.
[02:02.000 --> 02:08.000]  And I've got intros from 15 years ago saying we are the resistance.
[02:08.000 --> 02:11.000]  We are the information war.
[02:11.000 --> 02:15.000]  We're going to identify the authoritarian system of globalism.
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  We're going to speak out against it. We're going to raise the alarm as modern day Paul reveres across the globe.
[02:21.000 --> 02:31.000]  And we are going to re-institute the free market capitalist nation-state system of the Renaissance prosperity and the long march to the stars.
[02:31.000 --> 02:41.000]  The long glorious pioneer march to the stars and unlocking the secrets of the universe and the globalists, they don't want that.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  They think they've already got the secrets. They've already got their AI.
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  They want to wall us off from the future.
[02:48.000 --> 02:50.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, that's not going to happen.
[02:50.000 --> 03:01.000]  And now these enemies of progress, these enemies of freedom, these enemies of America, these enemies of western civilization and Christianity that are in control of our governments
[03:01.000 --> 03:10.000]  are saying everyone that wants freedom is a Russian agent because we couldn't think for ourselves, we couldn't vote against Hillary.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  There it is, DrudgeReport.com.
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  Media matters. That's George Soros, the Nazi collaborator.
[03:17.000 --> 03:24.000]  Drudge infected America with Russian propaganda.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  And I guess he infected it with the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN. He links to everything.
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  But there it is.
[03:31.000 --> 03:36.000]  And they track where, how he linked to Interfax, Itar, Toss and Pravda.
[03:36.000 --> 03:42.000]  And he linked to the Japanese and Chinese and Mexican news too. And he linked to all their reports.
[03:42.000 --> 03:49.000]  Just like he links to the media matters report right there.
[03:49.000 --> 03:52.000]  I guess he's infecting us with media matters.
[03:52.000 --> 03:55.000]  Look at that. He's infecting us.
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.000]  He infected us with David Brock and George Soros. No, he didn't.
[04:01.000 --> 04:06.000]  He covered the full spectrum of the news, just like we do. But see, it's never going to end.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.000]  We're all Russian agents. Oh, and Mueller, Mueller's closing in now.
[04:12.000 --> 04:21.000]  Oh, but it turns out Clapper now goes on CNN and reverses all his previous lies and says, we did spy on Trump.
[04:21.000 --> 04:25.000]  We did spy on Manafort. We did spy on Trump Tower. We did.
[04:25.000 --> 04:31.000]  Because he knows the president's in power now and is able to bring that info out through the intelligence committees to the proper channels.
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  And you guys are a pack of criminals.
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  Remember, Mueller is the king criminal or the Lord High Protector of Corruption.
[04:39.000 --> 04:45.000]  The Lord High Chancellor, the defender of evil, the defender of the faith and the worship of battle met.
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  And the defender of the great pedophile armies, the defender of the Clintons.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  You want to know if Mueller's corrupt?
[04:51.000 --> 04:59.000]  Mueller is the great chess piece of this Luciferian conspiracy against Christ and against America.
[05:22.000 --> 05:32.000]  This may be a bitter pill to swallow, but the right to keep in bare arms is not an outdated, dusty idea some old dead white guys dreamed up in fear of the Redcoats.
[05:32.000 --> 05:38.000]  No, it is just as essential to liberty today as it was in 1776.
[05:38.000 --> 05:45.000]  The original amendments we refer to as the Bill of Rights contained ten of what the constitutional framers termed unalienable rights.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  The Bill of Rights came to us with blinders on.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  It doesn't recognize color or class or wealth.
[05:51.000 --> 05:57.000]  It protects not just the rights of actors or editors or reporters, but extends even to those we love to hate.
[05:57.000 --> 06:19.000]  This is a small excerpt from Tralton Heston.
[06:27.000 --> 06:35.000]  Our engines added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and accelerate our
[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000]  journey towards death.

[08:23.800 --> 08:29.800]  The first report to say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by the shooting.
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.800]  It is a big idea, a new order.
[08:33.800 --> 08:43.800]  It was almost as if you were planned in force, it just banked.
[08:43.800 --> 09:00.800]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[09:00.800 --> 09:25.800]  You were with us, or you were with us, or you were with us.
[09:25.800 --> 09:41.080]  There'll be more.
[09:41.080 --> 09:49.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this worldwide broadcast. We're going to be here for the next four hours live
[09:50.120 --> 09:55.480]  Mark Dyson, many other amazing researchers are going to be joining us
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.920]  But the big breaking news right now on this worldwide Thursday transmission
[10:01.920 --> 10:10.280]  Is that Clapper now admits that Trump quote could have been wiretabbed during the Manafort surveillance
[10:11.200 --> 10:19.520]  And that's what Trump's always said Trump Tower his campaign had his staff and now we know they had foreign surveillance warrants
[10:19.520 --> 10:26.200]  And they had the Justice Department doing it separately at least three different ones that they
[10:26.200 --> 10:32.040]  Parallel constructed and what they do is they have massive surveillance on everything
[10:32.320 --> 10:37.620]  They're reportedly giving access to a whole chain of high-level Democratic operatives
[10:38.000 --> 10:41.000]  The Podestas and others could just dial in to all the files
[10:41.520 --> 10:47.380]  Listen to people's phone calls listen to all the recordings go into whole databases of emails
[10:48.960 --> 10:52.080]  Basically Podesta Hillary all of them Obama
[10:53.960 --> 10:55.720]  admittedly
[10:55.720 --> 11:01.200]  Had total access to everybody's email and computers and phones just like they had the passcodes
[11:01.720 --> 11:03.320]  That's all
[11:03.320 --> 11:08.000]  Except you don't record all your phone calls or most your phone calls. They do
[11:08.920 --> 11:10.920]  It's just like when you call up
[11:11.760 --> 11:17.920]  The department store and they say this may be monitored for quality assurance or you call the phone company
[11:17.920 --> 11:19.920]  It's the same thing. It's all
[11:19.920 --> 11:26.360]  All recorded and they've got heads up high-tech computer displays and they can go in and go to somebody's name
[11:26.360 --> 11:28.880]  They can hit another button see all your relationships
[11:29.120 --> 11:35.880]  Everybody you know who they know and they can just go in with one of those warrants. It's a blanket warrant to everything
[11:36.480 --> 11:40.960]  But under parallel construction. This has been declassified and leaked the last decade
[11:41.800 --> 11:45.200]  First the DEA got caught doing and they have full access to all these databases
[11:45.200 --> 11:50.480]  They go create their case first then they go get warrants later and then go re-engineer
[11:51.040 --> 11:53.560]  Their criminal investigation that was criminal
[11:54.120 --> 11:59.080]  And by that doing it is totally illegal. They're very famous for planting things as well
[11:59.360 --> 12:04.120]  So they weren't just rigging the polls. They weren't just giving Hillary all the questions for the debates
[12:04.120 --> 12:11.440]  It wasn't just Hillary and her even low-level aides were on the phone with the New York Times editors every day
[12:11.440 --> 12:16.800]  Telling them what to do and approving every story about Trump
[12:20.680 --> 12:25.640]  You understand and if you don't believe me about parallel construction Reuters supposedly broke it four years ago
[12:25.640 --> 12:30.920]  We broke it of course with our sources, but you can just type in a parallel construction
[12:33.120 --> 12:36.640]  DEA recreated criminal cases
[12:36.640 --> 12:43.280]  And that's what they do. And so they've been up there lying the entire time. We're gonna get into all that
[12:44.680 --> 12:50.000]  MSNBC worries Trump use of the word sovereign is basically racist. That's globalism
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.160]  That's what they're gonna use this whole race narrative that you have a nation have a religion
[12:55.000 --> 12:57.000]  Have any type of
[12:57.920 --> 12:59.920]  freedom
[13:00.480 --> 13:05.520]  Well, you're a racist that's that's the game the globalist are playing because they've already exploited the third world
[13:05.520 --> 13:09.320]  So now they're just gonna go. Oh, if you're Asian or Hispanic or black or
[13:10.800 --> 13:14.920]  Arabic whites of the devil and we're going to politically destroy them
[13:14.920 --> 13:21.240]  But it's a bunch of old weird robber Baron white people captaining it and quarterbacking it. It's ridiculously
[13:22.800 --> 13:24.080]  obvious
[13:24.080 --> 13:26.080]  now continuing
[13:27.840 --> 13:29.840]  We're gonna get into
[13:29.840 --> 13:38.280]  Trump saying that Rand Paul is quote a negative force when it comes to fixing health care. No, mr. President
[13:42.880 --> 13:44.880]  Rand Paul is
[13:45.760 --> 13:54.680]  Extremely informed and extremely professional and extremely honorable and it's John McCain that said he'd vote for that repeal bill that was pretty good a
[13:54.680 --> 14:00.080]  Few weeks ago a month ago, and then he had to run off for his brain tumors surgery
[14:00.080 --> 14:07.560]  And then he came back once he was the victim he could then turn on all of his constituents and vote against the repeal of Obamacare
[14:08.200 --> 14:10.200]  So it's John
[14:10.440 --> 14:12.120]  McCain
[14:12.120 --> 14:17.240]  The new bill we've got is a screw job and Rand Paul breaks it down
[14:17.280 --> 14:21.580]  We have his breakdowns at info wars calm. Is it better than Obamacare?
[14:21.580 --> 14:25.380]  Yeah, it's like do you want to be shot by a 22 in the foot?
[14:26.060 --> 14:30.020]  Or you do or do you want to be shot with a 12 gauge with double-ought buck in the chest?
[14:30.460 --> 14:35.100]  Well, I don't want to be shot with a 22 in the foot and I don't want to be shot with buck shot the chest
[14:35.100 --> 14:37.620]  But if I got to take one, I'll take the 22
[14:38.740 --> 14:40.740]  Long rifle to the foot
[14:41.140 --> 14:48.700]  And so Rand Paul is completely right and I get Trump is a pragmatist and just wants to get rid of Obamacare because it's designed
[14:48.700 --> 14:52.340]  To bankrupt the economy. It's designed to not just bring down health care
[14:52.340 --> 14:58.380]  But with clowered and pivot strategies according to Zikula manual on Fox News and Pocahontas
[14:58.660 --> 15:01.380]  Senator Warren they've all should I play the clubs again?
[15:02.060 --> 15:05.380]  From four years ago and a year ago and two weeks ago
[15:05.860 --> 15:12.380]  Pocahontas came back out and said yeah, we plan to bankrupt the economy with Obamacare and reorganize it and have a single
[15:12.380 --> 15:19.060]  Pair but run by private corporations a massive screw job. So that's coming up. I'm gonna go into detail on that and
[15:20.500 --> 15:22.500]  There's just so much more
[15:24.580 --> 15:29.740]  There's some good comedy with Lawrence O'Donnell who's such a contentious arrogant
[15:30.900 --> 15:32.900]  conceited
[15:33.500 --> 15:35.500]  Entitled
[15:35.500 --> 15:43.260]  Brat it's the only other person that oozed more fake gravitas and more puffery and
[15:45.460 --> 15:46.580]  Sycophantic
[15:46.580 --> 15:53.780]  Fop behavior was that paylay guy that finally got removed from 60 minutes because he was just an arrogant idiot in a suit
[15:54.660 --> 15:56.660]  Knowing Hillary never fell down
[15:56.660 --> 16:06.340]  You just made that up and certain of its goes. Well, yes, she did and she was really sick. Well, the campaign said it was pneumonia
[16:06.660 --> 16:13.100]  The campaign said it was and in terms goes we don't believe Hillary. She's a liar and
[16:14.180 --> 16:20.740]  They left it in 60 minutes. He was the producer of that too thinking. Well, I'm in the big suit acting all puffy
[16:20.740 --> 16:28.060]  How dare you say them the moon is round how dare you say the ocean is wet and the sky is blue
[16:28.140 --> 16:31.260]  We say Hillary is an angel a goddess
[16:32.140 --> 16:38.180]  Remember those CNN videos they have her glowing and turn the iris up all the way with her wearing a white
[16:38.420 --> 16:43.780]  Princess Leah outfit being praised by a bunch of women and they went she's a goddess
[16:43.780 --> 16:52.140]  No, she's an old evil demonic woman with a trail of destruction and death and everything else behind them
[16:53.260 --> 16:58.300]  We don't care if you have her glow like some goddess come down from heaven
[17:01.740 --> 17:05.420]  You're up in your attic or something and saw something like that you'd be sure you'd seen the devil
[17:06.300 --> 17:10.300]  The devil masquerades as an angel of light. Well, there ain't much masquerading there
[17:10.300 --> 17:12.300]  looks like
[17:16.100 --> 17:19.260]  Pennywise meets the church lady
[17:20.300 --> 17:24.380]  And then we're getting into this huge news and this is this is so important as I've seen this happen
[17:24.380 --> 17:29.580]  I saw them open up or call for opening up a criminal investigation of myself
[17:29.980 --> 17:31.980]  Drudge Breitbart
[17:32.980 --> 17:34.980]  That's pretty much it
[17:34.980 --> 17:39.980]  Claiming we're directed by the Russians and get money from the Russians and
[17:42.420 --> 17:46.620]  I noticed and I'm not complaining that the minute that happened drudge went from Lincoln
[17:46.620 --> 17:51.100]  That's like once a week or something like once a month, which is fine. Drudge can never linked me again. I love him
[17:51.100 --> 17:55.140]  He's awesome. He's great trailblazer done so much for independent media in America in the world
[17:55.140 --> 17:55.740]  That's fine
[17:55.740 --> 18:02.380]  But I do together they opened up in Congress saying we're criminally investigating Alex Jones and and and and drudge and all these groups
[18:02.380 --> 18:04.700]  You know, we've opened up this espionage deal
[18:04.700 --> 18:08.620]  Of course, it's totally made up and then you hear the federal elections commission go
[18:08.620 --> 18:12.580]  Yeah, we want a criminal investigation of Alex Jones and and Matt drudge and Breitbart
[18:16.100 --> 18:20.620]  And and drudge is linking to the New York Times the Washington Post everybody more than he links to you know me or world
[18:20.620 --> 18:22.060]  net daily or whatever
[18:22.060 --> 18:24.580]  You could say drudge is now
[18:26.340 --> 18:31.260]  Working for for for media matters, of course, he's not he's linking to George Soros's

[25:14.960 --> 25:19.600]  Does that mean that he works for the New York Times? This is this is true?
[25:21.320 --> 25:26.440]  McCarthyism, but it's being done by the leftists that loved Russia back when it was communist now
[25:26.440 --> 25:31.240]  They hate it because it's Christian and here is Matt drudge media matters drudge
[25:32.320 --> 25:34.320]  infected America

[26:23.640 --> 26:25.640]  This is the biggest bullying
[26:26.560 --> 26:31.000]  disinfo lying crud and they're trying to build a case
[26:31.720 --> 26:35.680]  To keep pushing these in criminal investigations that have been closed
[26:35.680 --> 26:40.040]  They had a counter espionage investigation of the independent media earlier this year
[26:40.680 --> 26:45.360]  Even when the president was just getting into office by the Democrat moles
[26:46.000 --> 26:50.040]  Inside the FBI and there was nothing there because there is nothing
[26:50.760 --> 26:56.440]  That's how Paul Watson has said he knows the rush the things made up when they started listing him as a Russian operative
[26:57.280 --> 27:00.520]  But but look Silicon Valley giant to give people

[27:41.720 --> 27:45.400]  This is how they play games folks. You read the report. It says look
[27:45.760 --> 27:52.560]  He linked hundreds of times in the last six years to Russian news. Oh, of course. He did
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.600]  We've linked hundreds and hundreds of times and we've linked hundreds and hundreds of times to everything else. That's what we do
[27:57.600 --> 28:04.240]  But again, they play this game with these graphs to make it look all dirty. Oh, look, it's increased to
[28:04.640 --> 28:09.480]  They say the Sputnik coverage. That's one of these Russian news websites
[28:10.640 --> 28:18.320]  Look Sputnik didn't even exist until a couple years ago, but they've got Sputnik graphs here of so so a the graph isn't even
[28:18.560 --> 28:20.040]  accurate
[28:20.040 --> 28:26.120]  But B when you look at all this again, of course Russian news increased during the election
[28:26.120 --> 28:31.600]  Because drudge will show the New York Times his claims about Russians that he'll have a link to Russia to get there if you want it
[28:31.600 --> 28:36.040]  That's what you do as a journalist is you put both sides out there
[28:36.720 --> 28:42.240]  But this is an attempt again with a new red scare to bully bully bully bully bully and
[28:43.200 --> 28:48.720]  If they're able to get Trump and then have new elections, which they Hillary said two days ago. They want
[28:49.960 --> 28:54.440]  They are never going to let this country go back to being free again. They're gonna have staged elections
[28:54.440 --> 28:56.440]  just like
[28:56.560 --> 28:58.560]  Venezuela and
[29:00.760 --> 29:09.680]  It is incredible that we sit here with these dangerous anti-american authoritarian dirtbags who've told their
[29:11.000 --> 29:19.000]  Victims their zombie supporters to go out and beat up conservatives to beat up libertarians to beat up Christians to beat up people at prayer

[30:08.720 --> 30:12.640]  Not from want of honor or virtue so much as from the downright
[30:12.920 --> 30:15.440]  Ignorance of the nature of coin credit and circulation
[30:15.440 --> 30:22.360]  Those are the words of John Adams the second president of the United States. Are you ignorant of the private Federal Reserve?
[30:22.560 --> 30:25.160]  Do you understand the nature of our fiat currency?
[30:25.320 --> 30:31.960]  Do you understand how a private corporation has the ability to create boom and bust cycles and to profit from it?
[30:31.960 --> 30:37.600]  What kind of leverage do these people and the Federal Reserve have over the American people or for that matter?
[30:37.600 --> 30:40.760]  What kind of leverage do the Saudis have over our money?
[30:40.760 --> 30:48.560]  Will you be a slave or will you be free? Adams also said Liberty cannot be preserved without general knowledge among the people

[33:34.400 --> 33:38.200]  It is Thursday the 21st day of
[33:39.160 --> 33:44.160]  September 2017 hard to believe soon 2017 will be gone as well
[33:44.760 --> 33:47.760]  You can put it up on screen if you want guys a little joke
[33:47.760 --> 33:57.560]  Photoshop somebody did online of myself Trump and Vladimir Putin all riding together on the same horse
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  shirtless
[34:01.200 --> 34:06.360]  But you know this really is a big joke and we should recognize it as a joke
[34:07.360 --> 34:13.720]  But at the same time understand that the people pushing this whole narrative are really really nasty nasty globalist
[34:13.720 --> 34:18.560]  And it was Matt one of the producers that just pointed out if you just joined us
[34:19.440 --> 34:20.600]  that
[34:20.600 --> 34:27.400]  The Democrat Party funded Hillary Clinton John Podesta directed George Soros funded media matters
[34:28.560 --> 34:35.600]  Has called for criminal investigations of myself for working with Russia and they've had members of the federal elections commission and members of Congress
[34:35.600 --> 34:40.240]  They've had hearings. We've played those and let me tell you when you're sitting there watching C-span
[34:40.240 --> 34:48.840]  And they're having armed service committee hearings just saying and Alex Jones who works for Russia and Alex Jones who gets paid by Russia
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.640]  Yeah, I get paid by our listeners funding our operation. It's insane
[34:54.640 --> 35:00.760]  But it shows what criminals they are and it shows how Hillary actually got money from the Russians and so to Podesta
[35:00.760 --> 35:06.640]  And they were scared that Trump was gonna go after him for that. So they jumped on the Russian narrative first
[35:06.640 --> 35:13.440]  No, and in New York City in DC, you can't swing a stick and not hit a Russian or a Chinese operative and
[35:14.040 --> 35:17.480]  Knowing some of the people were gonna talk to him, you know arm services committee
[35:17.840 --> 35:19.120]  Intelligence committee
[35:19.120 --> 35:24.240]  Judicial committee people like sessions had had met with the Russian ambassador three times in
[35:25.000 --> 35:30.520]  2016 in his capacity as a senator turned out Pelosi met with him 30 plus times that year
[35:30.520 --> 35:34.040]  Then she said she hadn't but there were photos in the guest book and everything else
[35:34.040 --> 35:38.040]  So they're playing this giant game because we're the Americans
[35:38.560 --> 35:42.720]  We're the folks that want sovereignty. We're the people that are standing up for
[35:43.080 --> 35:49.720]  Getting the stock market up getting factory jobs back in controlling our borders deporting people that commit aggravated felonies
[35:50.760 --> 35:53.680]  But they've got a big report media matters drudge
[35:54.680 --> 35:57.800]  infected America with Russian propaganda and then they say oh
[35:58.760 --> 36:00.040]  over
[36:00.040 --> 36:01.800]  four and a half years
[36:01.800 --> 36:09.320]  He linked to them 400 times whoopty. I'm surprised. It's only 400 times. He's got a couple links today to the New York Times
[36:09.960 --> 36:13.240]  In fact, you could actually argue. Hey drudge. You're the biggest website in the world
[36:13.240 --> 36:17.880]  Why are you sending all the traffic to the Washington Post and the New York Times and all the establishment guys?
[36:17.880 --> 36:20.360]  Well, you want to hear what they're saying. I'm not criticizing that
[36:22.240 --> 36:24.240]  But they all know full well
[36:24.680 --> 36:28.600]  Thousands of times he's linked to the New York Times compared to 400 to Russian news
[36:28.600 --> 36:35.840]  And why wouldn't you link to the English Russian news when they've got wildfires or earthquakes or Ukraine news or political stuff?
[36:35.840 --> 36:42.120]  To get multiple sides you go to CNN you get their view you go to the Washington Post you get their view you go to drudge report
[36:42.120 --> 36:47.760]  You get the whole thing. There's like 60 70 articles are today same thing with them for wars calm
[36:48.480 --> 36:50.480]  or news wars calm
[36:50.840 --> 36:55.960]  You go there in fact my own listeners go. Why are you linked to the New York Times or the Washington poster?
[36:55.960 --> 36:59.440]  Why'd you link to Hillary saying something evil and putting out her propaganda? I
[37:00.240 --> 37:02.240]  Want you to hear what the witch said
[37:02.840 --> 37:08.440]  Laurence O'Donnell is blowing up in this new video from behind the scenes during breaks because they let a conservative
[37:09.320 --> 37:12.040]  Say something he didn't like that made too much sense
[37:13.600 --> 37:16.280]  He wanted it edited down where it didn't make sense
[37:16.800 --> 37:22.720]  That's what they do. He's like what you do that made too much sense now. I've got to respond to it
[37:22.720 --> 37:25.920]  You're supposed to edit it to not make any sense
[37:26.600 --> 37:28.600]  Just like they did with
[37:28.600 --> 37:30.360]  Megan Kelly
[37:30.360 --> 37:32.360]  The people saw that it was just
[37:32.880 --> 37:35.120]  incoherent jibbering and jump cuts and
[37:36.320 --> 37:43.080]  It wasn't what I said they take things I said ten minutes thirty minutes apart from eight hours of interviews and just weld them together
[37:43.080 --> 37:46.800]  And we released obviously excerpts of audio showing the fraud
[37:46.800 --> 37:55.200]  Our videos exposing her had more views than her show on NBC. Just our YouTubes and Facebook's
[37:55.960 --> 38:00.560]  Again, they're a husk. They're a joke. They're over. What are they gonna do?
[38:00.640 --> 38:07.560]  Do they thank drudge sending them the majority of their traffic at the New York Times is from that drudge the Washington post
[38:07.560 --> 38:14.400]  No, they all write articles about how evil drudge is and how he's a Russian. Oh here. Here's all your traffic. Oh screw you Russian
[38:19.200 --> 38:26.120]  Just a month ago federal elections commission member Democrat wants criminal investigation. They already had one there was nothing there
[38:26.120 --> 38:29.600]  They already had an FBI counter espionage investigation
[38:31.080 --> 38:34.960]  Look at this. This is this is dangerous, but what did Matt point out?
[38:34.960 --> 38:36.960]  He goes Alex
[38:37.960 --> 38:43.000]  He goes, you notice they're demonizing Trump on CNN MSNBC ABC news
[38:43.720 --> 38:46.220]  Breathlessly that he kept saying nationalism nationalism
[38:46.680 --> 38:52.400]  Nation-states are for their people not to an international combine. We should all work together internationally
[38:52.520 --> 38:59.520]  We should have global trade but not globalism that transfers the power to unelected systems like the TPP
[38:59.520 --> 39:06.560]  Folks just a year ago. They wouldn't let members of Congress see the TPP
[39:07.440 --> 39:10.360]  Then there was a big enough human cry in the last months of the election
[39:10.360 --> 39:14.200]  They would let senior members go in a room without their cell phones
[39:14.800 --> 39:18.840]  To read one piece of paper at a time of over 10,000 pages
[39:20.640 --> 39:26.120]  That's how you conquer a nation with a bunch of bureaucratic takeover not armies we'd fight armies
[39:26.120 --> 39:34.360]  But of all of its waves of children coming in and the UN and refugees and global government and loving and it's helpful and
[39:34.360 --> 39:35.960]  You know virtue signal
[39:35.960 --> 39:42.240]  You're a white supremacist if you don't turn yourself over to world government if you don't accept Obamacare written by the Republicans
[39:43.200 --> 39:44.440]  and
[39:44.440 --> 39:51.800]  So he pointed out MSNBC worries Trump uses the word sovereign as a racist dog whistle
[39:51.800 --> 39:54.600]  They said it was over the top a
[39:54.600 --> 39:56.400]  loving
[39:56.400 --> 40:03.600]  Focused good speech about free market and capitalism and brotherhood of humankind and all of this
[40:04.800 --> 40:11.760]  And they're like oh, did you hear it? Oh the code words the code the code words like our government doesn't
[40:11.840 --> 40:18.200]  Have one-sided tariffs where all the jobs go to China where there's slave factories so Apple can make billions more a day
[40:19.320 --> 40:24.120]  I mean Apple's making billions a day or so every couple days they make a billion dollars
[40:24.120 --> 40:26.120]  They got suicide factories
[40:27.120 --> 40:33.960]  But it's okay, cuz it's like we're Apple we're liberal we said you were white supremacist shut up about our death factories
[40:34.080 --> 40:40.080]  Shut up about 18 hour workdays force-drugging robots. We tried to bring in replace people didn't work shut up
[40:40.240 --> 40:43.320]  We've got hippie beards and act non-threatening
[40:44.160 --> 40:47.280]  When behind the scenes there psycho demons
[40:48.600 --> 40:50.800]  Clearly they got rid of jobs because he wouldn't play games
[40:50.800 --> 40:56.200]  You know against the American people jobs said don't get your kids have iPads don't let your kids watch TV
[40:56.200 --> 40:59.440]  It's ruining their brains. Oh here. Here's some weaponized cancer brother
[41:01.520 --> 41:03.520]  So
[41:03.520 --> 41:05.640]  These people mean business, okay
[41:06.520 --> 41:12.840]  They mean business and oh look they've got drudges hat his little classic straw hat fedora
[41:12.840 --> 41:16.080]  And they've got it red white and blue the Russian colors
[41:16.080 --> 41:24.280]  But even when they lie to tell the truth cuz drudges red white and blue and this isn't some gesticulation or exercise and
[41:24.560 --> 41:26.560]  Kissing the butt of Matt drudge
[41:26.880 --> 41:32.880]  It's a fact that if they can bring him down they can bring us all down and they're trying to sell this idea and bully him
[41:33.560 --> 41:40.680]  With the congressional hearings and everything where they go a drudge amplifies Alex Jones and info wars and we've got criminal
[41:40.680 --> 41:46.960]  Investigations going and then drudge goes from linking to us every couple days to once a month
[41:46.960 --> 41:53.040]  Which is fine because our listeners are pushing record traffic to info wars calm and news wars calm
[41:53.040 --> 41:57.160]  And we understand that drudge is under attack and God knows what's happened in behind the scenes
[41:57.160 --> 41:59.360]  He gave us the only exclusive interview
[42:00.280 --> 42:02.280]  He's given it like two years
[42:04.200 --> 42:09.160]  He did one other little ten minute one, but the last two years we've gotten the main interview there's been two interviews
[42:09.160 --> 42:13.600]  We got it. I love it. I'm not one of these people where somebody helps experiment
[42:13.600 --> 42:18.280]  We're doing five hundred percent and does a great job and as a stalwart and
[42:19.480 --> 42:22.400]  Then for whatever reason doesn't link does as much that's fine
[42:22.520 --> 42:26.600]  But I know this media matters is going that drudge you better not link tell us Jones better
[42:26.600 --> 42:28.800]  Don't link tell us Jones you better not link to Breitbart
[42:28.800 --> 42:32.440]  You better like anybody else you better leave all the libertarian and patriot sites alone
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.960]  And this is all part of the isolating Trump and isolating drudge and isolating info wars
[42:36.960 --> 42:44.160]  Where they admit? Oh, we've banned Breitbart and info wars from Trump because Breitbart and info wars CNN reported four months ago
[42:44.480 --> 42:48.080]  Say that there was warrantless wiretapping of Trump Tower against Manafort
[42:49.480 --> 42:52.520]  And of course now you learn months later. We were absolutely
[42:53.200 --> 42:56.000]  110% on target and correct
[42:56.960 --> 43:03.140]  That's why they don't want the president looking at drudge report calm because he saw the info wars article
[43:03.140 --> 43:07.580]  Let's just say I've talked to people very close to the president about it
[43:09.140 --> 43:14.380]  They saw the info war story and they are just horrified because the president then went and pardoned him
[43:14.820 --> 43:21.380]  They don't want him exercising executive authority. They don't want that just like they don't want if they can't keep drudge
[43:21.500 --> 43:24.260]  From the president will just keep info wars from drudge. See
[43:25.700 --> 43:29.060]  And people could say well, you know, why is drudge giving into that pressure?
[43:29.060 --> 43:34.300]  I'm not even sure that's the case. But clearly, I think that's two plus two equals four. The point is is that
[43:34.940 --> 43:38.020]  This is how they're going to win and everyone knows that
[43:41.340 --> 43:46.300]  Drudge starts linking two or three times even more to mainstream news than he was and
[43:46.740 --> 43:52.100]  The mouth of George Soros and Hillary says we want to arrest you and shut you down
[43:52.340 --> 43:57.380]  We've now we think we've bullied you whether it's true or not. We think we've bullied you
[43:57.380 --> 44:00.900]  So now we're gonna rub your face in the mud while we piss on your back
[44:01.620 --> 44:03.940]  Excuse the fridge and that's it
[44:05.460 --> 44:07.460]  And that's how this works
[44:12.140 --> 44:14.140]  And it's incredible
[44:14.140 --> 44:16.620]  The president needs an intelligence network
[44:16.620 --> 44:22.900]  The president needs to see a video of Hillary doing something evil or of what his constituents have to say and that's what drudge does
[44:22.900 --> 44:28.740]  It links to YouTube links to everything. It's wide spectrum. Whatever's interesting to Matt drudge. He links to just like whatever's interesting
[44:28.740 --> 44:35.780]  To my writers and myself at info wars.com our listeners criticizes. They don't get it. They go. Why are most the links on your site?
[44:36.300 --> 44:39.620]  To mainstream news. We're just showing you what the enemy saying
[44:40.620 --> 44:45.900]  It doesn't mean we work for the New York Times when I link to RT. It's mainly because it's pretty
[44:46.860 --> 44:50.660]  Balanced reporting on almost all issues and they let us post the whole thing
[44:50.660 --> 44:58.700]  We link to a lot of RT stuff. I mean you read these RT articles. They are way more accurate when you've done the research. I
[45:00.020 --> 45:06.100]  Mean RT is giving Rand Paul a platform to talk about how this isn't a real repeal of Obamacare Wow
[45:06.100 --> 45:07.700]  What a great favor
[45:07.700 --> 45:12.060]  The evil Russians are trying to get us a better deal on our health care. It's not that
[45:13.020 --> 45:17.460]  Russia's been under oligarchs Russia's been under elites Russia's been under the very same robber barons
[45:17.460 --> 45:23.220]  They understand it and they're Christian now and they're nationalistic now and they're anti radical Islam now
[45:23.220 --> 45:27.900]  And they really want to dig out of this and they want America to dig out of it with them
[45:27.900 --> 45:31.860]  And that's why the globals are so pissed and that is the Russian relationship
[45:32.500 --> 45:39.820]  They just had a big al-Qaeda ISIS offensive their last ditch battle the bulls against Syrian and Russian forces and US
[45:39.820 --> 45:43.580]  Forces and so big bear bombers just bombed and killed
[45:43.580 --> 45:46.940]  850 plus ISIS al-Qaeda fighters today
[45:48.700 --> 45:54.300]  That's what the Russians are doing is bombing radical jihadists right now with heavy bombers
[45:55.380 --> 45:57.740]  That's what they're doing turning back al-Qaeda
[45:58.420 --> 46:02.500]  Offensives that kill every Christian they get their filthy dirty maggot hands on
[46:03.980 --> 46:09.380]  Meanwhile the West is so sold out to radical Islam from Germany to England of the US if you criticize
[46:09.380 --> 46:16.900]  ISIS in your own blog the dean threatens to suspend you or does suspend you with the government protects ISIS
[46:16.900 --> 46:21.740]  They bring ISIS fighters back to Europe and give them better welfare than the general public gets
[46:22.460 --> 46:30.060]  That's in the news. I've got stacks here where they're banning more outdoor beer festivals because the Muslims will attack them
[46:30.260 --> 46:34.140]  They're attacking women that walk dogs screaming dogs are unclean
[46:34.140 --> 46:41.860]  The answer is don't wear short miniskirts and don't walk dogs. Do what the Muslims want then over to them from Germany
[46:42.500 --> 46:46.340]  To Malaysia. They are banning their annual beer festivals
[46:47.300 --> 46:52.460]  Because the Muslims will come up and blow your butt up or stab your ass
[46:53.220 --> 47:00.380]  Because they're so tolerant. Let's go back to the article there it is info wars calm directly linked to the Malaysian news by Don Salazar
[47:00.380 --> 47:05.020]  And you will beer festival canned following protest from Islamist
[47:06.980 --> 47:15.580]  But let's go back to that clip I just mentioned video MSNBC Steve Watson article news wars calm MSNBC worries Trump use of the word sovereign
[47:16.180 --> 47:22.620]  Is a dog whistle? That's right even saying we have a contrary is evil here it is
[47:23.460 --> 47:29.060]  See did you did you hear a buzzword or a dog whistle in in his?
[47:29.060 --> 47:32.180]  Repeated use of that back it up again
[47:32.180 --> 47:36.260]  They use this consensus garbage will have these panels of people with the king of fake news
[47:36.300 --> 47:44.780]  The god of fake news the poster boy of fake news the very essence of fake news the man caught putting out hundreds of fabricated reports
[47:45.060 --> 47:51.180]  Claiming he is a combat vet shot down by rocket-propelled grenade in Iraq
[47:51.540 --> 47:54.220]  Brian Williams back from under a rock
[47:54.220 --> 47:58.780]  Crawling directly out of Hillary Clinton's rear end on the kitchen table
[47:59.500 --> 48:03.940]  telling you having a country is evil and then go into these
[48:04.820 --> 48:08.540]  Ding-dongs he's got there to act all freaked out about it here it is
[48:09.260 --> 48:16.020]  Run and sovereignty. Did you did you hear a buzzword or a dog whistle in in his?
[48:16.820 --> 48:22.460]  Repeated use of that word. Yeah, we knew he was gonna talk a little bit about that because they had given us a little bit of a preview
[48:22.460 --> 48:27.380]  No words or anything, but so we were sort of expecting this theme, but it was just way
[48:27.860 --> 48:30.220]  More it was just over the top. It was you know
[48:30.220 --> 48:36.100]  It caused me to go back through and count how many times and so he he used that word sovereign or sovereignty 21 times
[48:36.100 --> 48:38.500]  Wow, it was definitely the word. I mean
[48:40.740 --> 48:42.820]  You know everybody wants to blame Israel for everything
[48:44.740 --> 48:46.740]  But Israel's liberals conservatives
[48:46.740 --> 48:52.820]  Christians Jews a lot of folks live over there. The point is I've been neutral in Israel because it's it's a
[48:53.300 --> 48:55.900]  Politically correct subject that's just fraught with mental illness
[48:56.180 --> 49:02.620]  But when Israel got the documents and winky leaks that George Soros does plan to overthrow the US and overthrow Israel
[49:03.820 --> 49:08.140]  And actually purge people Israel finally went okay, you're a criminal and okay
[49:08.140 --> 49:14.780]  You're trying to overthrow the US and now we actually have parts of the Israel lobby turning against Hollywood and the leftist lobby and
[49:14.780 --> 49:22.820]  Turning against all those crazy self-hating Jews and other people in Hollywood and in DC and there is a civil war really going on
[49:24.620 --> 49:29.540]  Inside the Israel lobby to a great extent and like the cavalry here comes Netanyahu over here
[49:30.300 --> 49:32.300]  actually, you know
[49:32.700 --> 49:34.700]  supporting what Trump's doing and
[49:35.900 --> 49:39.980]  That's being done out of self-preservation the globalists are gonna overthrow everything
[49:39.980 --> 49:47.260]  They're coming for everybody. Do you want and they're gonna turn loose on us a bunch of Muslims that kill each other and can't live in peace
[49:47.260 --> 49:52.900]  And can't even wipe their asses. Okay with toilet paper. I'm sorry. It's true. Excuse me
[49:52.900 --> 49:55.820]  I'm not trying to be like this, but I'm really angry right now
[49:55.820 --> 50:00.460]  And so again all the BS you've heard on the internet all the anti-Israel stuff
[50:00.460 --> 50:06.020]  Why do you wonder they try to beat you over the head everywhere from conservative angles and why white supremacists hate me so much and
[50:06.020 --> 50:11.020]  Always claim I work for Israel. It's because they've been funded by Soros and Southern Parvy Law Center
[50:11.020 --> 50:17.060]  It's come out that to a group the white supremacists are there to make nationalists and conservatives look bad
[50:17.060 --> 50:21.820]  So there's not a big tent for everybody to come and have a big free world of free market
[50:22.940 --> 50:25.740]  They've been caught red-handed folks and
[50:26.820 --> 50:30.260]  That's why they're so upset and don't know what to do now
[50:30.260 --> 50:37.580]  Because Jews in America are now waking up to this completely and that and that is a powerful lobby and
[50:37.980 --> 50:43.760]  Average a wealthy group of people and to have that whole group now against the globalist is just absolutely
[50:44.660 --> 50:46.660]  Devastating it because they got the documents
[50:47.980 --> 50:52.420]  Globalism was a complete a lot of folks went along with globalism. Just thinking it was kumbaya or you know
[50:52.420 --> 50:58.660]  Maybe they'd have a piece of the pie. No, nobody gets a piece of the pie, but mass death run by people like George Soros

[54:46.420 --> 54:50.900]  To even show a speech of Putin on info wars comm or drudge is evil
[54:50.900 --> 54:57.180]  And that we're working for these outside powers even though most of the links we have are to US news and even mainstream news
[54:57.180 --> 54:59.580]  That are our enemies. We're just showing what they're saying
[55:00.940 --> 55:06.460]  But they claim that we're the ones that want to destroy US sovereignty when Trump's delivering on the stock market
[55:07.100 --> 55:12.300]  Delivering on jobs delivering on the border delivering on everything you can and fighting hard to get the other stuff done
[55:13.380 --> 55:15.380]  but then you've got
[55:15.380 --> 55:20.940]  Brian Williams the poster man of fake news on MSNBC
[55:21.460 --> 55:28.460]  Saying it's a dog whistle and that it's racist and that sovereignty is bad and undermines the UN and the EU

[55:46.700 --> 55:54.740]  Russia's crime is their sovereign and their Christian and they've pulled away from the clutches of the globalist and they've successfully repulsed
[55:55.780 --> 56:00.540]  Bolshevik part two with Soros and Soros wants the same Bolshevik revolution
[56:00.540 --> 56:07.740]  100 years later. They want it this October. They had it planned with Hillary and it's blown up in their stinking faces
[56:07.940 --> 56:09.940]  Let's go back to the clip of these
[56:10.420 --> 56:17.180]  Absolute globalist operatives enemy soldiers in the Info war against America liars every one here. They are

[56:27.380 --> 56:29.380]  I mean everyone. What does that mean?
[56:30.900 --> 56:35.460]  It just means what he was talking about from the beginning, which is America first

[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:33.260]  Darren McBrain put out a meme on real Alex Jones yesterday that a lot of folks retweeted that shows
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:35.740]  What the average?
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:37.660]  Trendy looks like
[01:00:37.660 --> 01:00:43.100]  When you go out to one of these anti-trump or just pro-democrat rallies white men are terrorist
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:47.980]  And then you can't tell if the person's male or female. I'm not making fun of them
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:54.320]  It's this is what they've done to us in this culture. What kind of man do you trust with the future of the United States?
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.320]  this
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:58.360]  man or woman or
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.960]  person or this fella right over here and
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.920]  That's really what this comes down to ladies and gentlemen
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:15.400]  Rubber meets the road communism and socialism is what wicked control freaks want and super rich billionaires that own slave factories
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.640]  All over the world and are horribly evil and are helping communist China
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.600]  Iran and
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:27.680]  Pakistan round-up political dissenters that even mildly criticize
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.360]  the policies and imprison or kill them
[01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:40.320]  And it just goes on and on and on
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.920]  Now if we continue ladies and gentlemen
[01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:49.400]  Looking at the social engineering
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:56.200]  We have to be honest with ourselves about where this is all going and where it's all going is an attempt
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:58.720]  to start a civil war in
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.440]  this country
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.680]  And I'm gonna go to break this is a short segment
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.560]  And I'm gonna come back and look at the healthcare battle
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:11.680]  I'm gonna come back and look at the meltdown of Lawrence O'Donnell that is truly unhinged and
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.960]  Cringe worthy and we're also gonna look at Jimmy Kimmel threatens to assault Fox News host
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.960]  Which again
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:22.640]  Those towards all this hyping up of violence
[01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:27.640]  We've got a report. It's from yesterday, but I want to Eric's I didn't get to it on Morgan Friedman
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:29.720]  We're at war with Russia by Paul Watson
[01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:33.680]  We have CNN finally admitting the truth by Mark Dice
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.960]  Which is powerful and there's another one proof
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.000]  Gay frogs are real
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:47.600]  Do took clips of me talking about it and then interspersed with news articles and and and PBS documentaries
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:49.960]  admitting that the majority of the frogs
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.840]  in most areas in the United States are now gay and
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.840]  it actually
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:58.840]  shows what's happening and
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:01.960]  They they don't choose females
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.720]  They they go over to the male and then they go and they
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:09.720]  Live together and
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:17.160]  Then you read Brave New World written in 1933 32 he says that's the plan
[01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:19.920]  It has nothing to do whether you love gay people or hate them
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:23.080]  They're putting chemicals in the food and water where you look at men and women
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:25.600]  You can't tell what's what most of the time now
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:33.120]  And then you take things like serotonin reuptake inhibitors they increase the chance of early death
[01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.520]  33% and that's even mainstream news and you know what they're doing I
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:44.920]  Asked the question why is ABC news and NBC news and CNN and the BBC suddenly going
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.680]  You know, it's true at Racine is changing your snacks
[01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:53.560]  And you know, it's true fluoride does lower IQ 15 points on average and you know, it's true
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:55.640]  It does deform your baby and you know, it's true
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.680]  33% in acceleration or increase in early death with with Prozac type drugs
[01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.680]  That's luvox all of them
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:10.360]  They got to tell you because they know it's gonna get so bad now that what half your family's dying
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:16.760]  You know, oh, it's so liberal and the lack of expectancy is plunging and infant mortality is skyrocketing
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:22.840]  And and and and pediatric cancers are up 10,000 percent. I'm not saying all this to be negative
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:26.880]  If I wake up in the houses on fire, I'm gonna go hey everybody
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:29.400]  Let's get out of the house or try to put the fire with the fire extinguisher
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.680]  We can but you know, you kids and everybody get outside. That's not being negative the house on fire. We're getting out of here
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:42.320]  And the globalists have made the decision to not try to fix civilization and not try to make it better
[01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.520]  They've decided to ride this collapse down
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.400]  Using a global consolidation of control while everything collapses
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:55.480]  Extruding all that energy and everything to build their new escape civilization. That's what's happened
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:05:02.920]  James Madison the father of the Bill of Rights wrote where an excess of power prevails property of no sort is duly respected
[01:05:02.920 --> 01:05:08.040]  No man is safe in his opinions and his person and his faculties or in his possessions
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:11.480]  Is there any question that we have an excess of power in Washington?
[01:05:11.480 --> 01:05:18.600]  The only question is how do we contain it and how do we remove that power from Washington to our local communities to the
[01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:25.600]  Individual that is the ultimate concern the concentration of power the excess of power was always the chief
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:30.400]  Concern of the founders of this country. It was why the anti-fiddle is to pose the Constitution
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:34.600]  They believe they put safeguards in the Constitution to abuse that concentration of power
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:41.600]  But as James Madison also pointed out knowledge will forever govern ignorance of people who mean to be their own governors must
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:47.600]  Arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives arm yourself with the information of what your rulers are doing
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:54.600]  Of what the real constraints upon them are only then will you have the courage to nullify their actions?
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.600]  Friend4wars.com. I'm David Knight
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:01.600]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years of
[01:06:01.600 --> 01:06:07.600]  Seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us to mother nature to detoxify the body
[01:06:07.600 --> 01:06:12.600]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield Toxic metal and chemical defense support
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:19.600]  It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:26.600]  And it supports the info or it is a classical 360 when this is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year
[01:06:26.600 --> 01:06:32.600]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly get

[01:07:26.600 --> 01:07:33.600]  And when compared to traditional methods of preservation like canning or dehydrating, you know, like what you get at the grocery store
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:45.600]  There is no comparison. Harvestrite freeze dryers retain 97% of the food's taste, color and nutritional value and have a shelf life of up to 25 years
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:52.600]  Now that's what I call the miracle of food preservation. Harvestrite is truly the world's best, most affordable freeze dryer

[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:52.600]  I'm standing up against those who destroy this country and we speak

[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.600]  We're live broadcasting worldwide this is
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:10.600]  Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.600]  It's Alex Jones
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:19.600]  I'll play the clip in just a moment. CNN's chief legal analyst Jeffrey Tubin has surprisingly admitted the truth
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.600]  But the Trump-Russia conspiracy investigation, well, I guess half of the truth
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:28.600]  Well, considering this to CNN, just anything truthful is surprising
[01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:34.600]  But let's listen to what he's saying here and then when he's done, I will, as Paul Harvey used to say, tell you the rest of the story
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:46.600]  Not jump too far, just add one point that I think is, we sometimes miss is, you know, collusion is a word we throw around a lot about this investigation
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:54.600]  Was the government of Russia colluding with the Trump campaign? There is no federal crime called collusion
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:59.600]  It's not even clear that it's illegal for there to be some sort of coordination
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:04.600]  It would be outrageous, it would be improper, it would be a violation of our traditions
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:10.600]  But it is not clear that that's a federal crime and I think that's one of the peculiarities of this federal investigation
[01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:16.600]  That it is aimed at disclosing something that may itself not be a federal crime
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:20.600]  I can't even believe that he just admitted that, which is what normal people have been saying for months
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:25.600]  Including liberal Alan Dershowitz, who is a Harvard law professor
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:31.600]  Maybe Jeffery Tubin has finally decided to be a lawyer again, instead of just an anti-Trump Cooke CNN contributor
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.600]  But like I said, he's only admitted half of the truth, the real heart of the matter is, if collusion isn't the crime which it's not
[01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:42.600]  Of course, there wasn't any collusion, then why are they even having this investigation to begin with?
[01:10:42.600 --> 01:10:47.600]  The answer is that this investigation was an excuse for what's called investigatory creep
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:52.600]  Where they use the excuse of investigating this Trump-Russia collusion, which again isn't even a crime
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:57.600]  Even if it did happen, to then try to find other unrelated possible crimes
[01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:02.600]  And it looks like what may happen here is that President Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort
[01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:09.600]  May be indicted for not crossing a T or dotting an I on some tax forms from a decade ago
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:14.600]  Then they're gonna use that indictment to try to get a plea deal, to try to get him to roll over and give some dirt on Donald Trump
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:18.600]  Or just make up something in order to get a reduced sentence
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.600]  Oh and by the way, Paul Manafort was wiretapped before, during and after the election
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:28.600]  After a secret FISA warrant was issued, but former director of national intelligence, James Clapper
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.600]  Said that nobody in the Trump campaign was wiretapped
[01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:36.600]  If something like that happened, would this be something you would be aware of?
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:42.600]  I would certainly hope so, I can't say, obviously I'm not, I can't speak officially anymore
[01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:48.600]  But I will say that for the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw as DNI
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:55.600]  There was no such wiretapped activity mounted against the president, the president-elect at the time
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:58.600]  Or as a candidate or against his campaign
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:07.600]  I can't speak for other Title III authorized entities in the government or a state or local entity
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:12.600]  I was just gonna say, if the FBI, for instance, had a FISA court order of some sort for a surveillance
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.600]  Would that be information you would know or not know?
[01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:15.600]  Yes
[01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.600]  You would be told this?
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:17.600]  I would know that
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:19.600]  If there was a FISA court order on something like this?
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.600]  Something like this, absolutely
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:24.600]  And at this point you can't confirm or deny whether that exists?
[01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.600]  I can deny it
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:27.600]  There is no FISA court order?
[01:12:27.600 --> 01:12:29.600]  Not to my knowledge
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.600]  Anything at Trump Tower?
[01:12:30.600 --> 01:12:31.600]  No
[01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:33.600]  Oh by the way, guess where Paul Manafort lives?
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:35.600]  He lives in Trump Tower!
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:36.600]  He's got an apartment there!
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.600]  This, of course, is just one of the millions of reasons we call the NBC
[01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:41.600]  Nothing but crap and total fake news
[01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.600]  I'm Mark Dice, thanks for watching
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.600]  Alright, Mark is coming on with us at the start of the next hour
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.600]  I plan to open the phones up coming up at the bottom of this hour
[01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.600]  And we'll have open phones with Mark as well for the full hour
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:58.600]  Mark reaches millions of people a day
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.600]  He's been doing this for about 12, 13 years
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:06.600]  He's written a bunch of books, you name it, but only the last five years or so
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.600]  Has he really started hitting a lot of people
[01:13:08.600 --> 01:13:11.600]  He reached millions before, but now it's millions a day
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600]  That is so exciting to me
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.600]  To see him grow
[01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.600]  To see his common sense just really shine
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.600]  And all he's doing is pointing out what liars they are
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:24.600]  Now that video was from yesterday
[01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.600]  Now we've got something to add to this engine
[01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.600]  The caboose
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.600]  They admit that they had Trump and Trump Tower and Manafort
[01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:38.600]  Spied on, and Comey's lied and Clapper's lied
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:41.600]  Clapper's lied before and said there's no spying inside the US
[01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:43.600]  We played that clip yesterday
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.600]  But now Clapper has come out
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:49.600]  And saying he could have been
[01:13:49.600 --> 01:13:52.600]  So they're kind of letting this stinky thing out
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.600]  Real slow and quiet
[01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:57.600]  So that nobody knows where it came from
[01:13:57.600 --> 01:13:59.600]  Kind of like everybody's sitting there in church
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.600]  Nobody knows where the flatulence came from
[01:14:02.600 --> 01:14:05.600]  But Clapper's been denying any of this is going on
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.600]  Now he knows they're getting caught, so he's just kind of like
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.600]  Let me kind of let this slip out so nobody knows who did it
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:16.600]  And I hate to use gross analogies, but that's the analogy here
[01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:18.600]  Clapper crapped all over the floor
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.600]  Obama crapped all over the floor
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.600]  Hillary was just scrubbing it all over her faces
[01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:26.600]  They were on television during the campaign
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.600]  And when the president was president-elect
[01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.600]  Saying that they were wiretapping him
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:35.600]  That's why they knew they were Russians
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.600]  But then there's nothing really there
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:38.600]  They just wanted to put that out to sound credible
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.600]  Trump points out that's illegal
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:43.600]  Trump points out it's illegal to leak the information
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:46.600]  So they all then perjure themselves to Congress
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600]  And say they didn't
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.600]  But now Trump's the president
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:51.600]  Just like Conway said a few months ago
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.600]  They're like, how do you know
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:54.600]  Trump was spot on
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.600]  She goes, he's the president now
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.600]  And he's gotten access to it
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:14:59.600]  Now I can't get into it
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:00.600]  It's classified
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:02.600]  They went, oh, sure
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.600]  Sure you do, Toots
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:07.600]  Well, we don't need
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:09.600]  The fact that they admitted it previously
[01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.600]  Because they're such liars
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:11.600]  Who knows?
[01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:12.600]  It's now in the documents
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:14.600]  And they've now been forced to admit it
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:17.600]  Galactic level
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:19.600]  Galactic level fall on their face
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.600]  Not just because they've been proven to be congenital
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:23.600]  Liars again
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.600]  With all the late night comics
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:26.600]  Reading off teleprompters
[01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.600]  And all the rest of their garbage
[01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:31.600]  But it's illegal what they did
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.600]  Both leaking it
[01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:36.600]  And the way they did it for political purposes
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.600]  It's incredible
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.600]  And now they say
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.600]  We're going after Manafort for 10-year-old tax returns
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.600]  Not that he didn't pay the money
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:49.600]  This is directly from Manafort's lawyers
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:52.600]  But that he didn't fill out a federal form
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:56.600]  On time his CPA did it a year later
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:57.600]  And I can't tell you
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:15:59.600]  We got CPAs you name it
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:01.600]  But how many times you get a call from the CPA
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:03.600]  Oh, we forgot to follow us come do this
[01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:05.600]  Nobody's ever gone to jail for that
[01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:08.600]  But that's all they've got
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.600]  Swat team raids
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.600]  Pointing machine guns at him and his family
[01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:14.600]  To try to intimidate him
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.600]  What a group of lawless scum
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.600]  And Mueller is the Lord High Chancellor
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.600]  And he would be the Lord High Executioner
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.600]  Over America
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.600]  He covered up the Clinton crimes
[01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.600]  He covered up the Bush garbage
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600]  And the globalist
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:33.600]  And took Islamists off the terror watch list
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.600]  Where you couldn't even have an investigation
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600]  Of Muslims period
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:36.600]  I mean you look at Mueller
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:40.600]  He is a disgraceful person
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.600]  But what's even more disgraceful
[01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:43.600]  Is them holding him up
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:45.600]  Like he's this holy man
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:48.600]  Just like that degenerate pedophile pope
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.600]  And his deputy pope
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:53.600]  Caught kidnapping 100 kids and buggering them
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:54.600]  It's the same thing
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:58.600]  It's just a rotten nest of sick freaks
[01:16:58.600 --> 01:17:00.600]  Who wear suits and ties
[01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.600]  Well so did Ted Bundy
[01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:06.600]  And so did John Wayne Gacy
[01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:10.600]  So here's the rest of the story
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.600]  Backing up what Dice was just saying
[01:17:12.600 --> 01:17:14.600]  It's like backing up the sky's blue
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:15.600]  The sun's yellow
[01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.600]  Where birds fly in the air
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:20.600]  As you can argue some don't like ostriches
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:21.600]  The point is
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.600]  Is that this is now out
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:24.600]  And it's big
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:26.600]  And this is what we've been behind the scenes
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.600]  Hammering Trump with
[01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:30.600]  Because this is how he can take out
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:31.600]  All these unconstitutional enemies
[01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:32.600]  All these traitors
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:33.600]  All these liars
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.600]  All these people that have done
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:36.600]  What they say he's done
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.600]  They're the ones selling us out
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.600]  To the communist Chinese
[01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:40.600]  And to Saudi Arabia
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:41.600]  And to the EU
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:43.600]  And to Russia
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.600]  All of them are up to their eyeballs
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.600]  In Russian collusion
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.600]  Including Clapper
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.600]  And Brennan
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.600]  And Islamic collusion
[01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:53.600]  And that's why they're pointing to going
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:54.600]  Here's a Russian
[01:17:54.600 --> 01:17:56.600]  Here you go
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:59.600]  Because that's the least group involved
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600]  They don't want to blame all their friends
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.600]  All their buddies
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.600]  In the CHICOM operation
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:06.600]  So they blame their joint enemy the Russians
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:08.600]  Let's go to the clip
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.600]  Well I see that the fact that
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:11.600]  Manafort was wiretapped proves that
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.600]  The president was right to accuse
[01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:15.600]  The former president of wiretapping him
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:16.600]  And you were wrong
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:18.600]  What's your response?
[01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:21.600]  Well again I stand on that statement
[01:18:21.600 --> 01:18:24.600]  That you just replayed
[01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:29.600]  And I cannot comment on the media reporting
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.600]  Which is all we have
[01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:35.600]  About a FISA warrant
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:38.600]  Allegedly lodged against Mr. Manafort
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:40.600]  I can't comment on that
[01:18:40.600 --> 01:18:44.600]  I simply reiterate what I said in March
[01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:46.600]  And I stand on that
[01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.600]  Yeah and that there is as far as
[01:18:48.600 --> 01:18:51.600]  Trump tower being wiretapped
[01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.600]  According to the president
[01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:55.600]  You say what?
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:57.600]  I stand on what I said
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:58.600]  On the 5th of March
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.600]  On Meet the Press
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.600]  As you just replayed it
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.600]  Okay so did you know
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:04.600]  And I just wanted just for clarity
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:06.600]  Because there's been a lot of reporting on this
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.600]  And people on you know
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:09.600]  Especially those supporters
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:10.600]  The president is saying
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:11.600]  Oh here's proof
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.600]  So did you know about a FISA warrant
[01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.600]  Against Paul Manafort at the time?
[01:19:15.600 --> 01:19:16.600]  I did not
[01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:17.600]  You did not
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.600]  Okay
[01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:22.600]  And again I have to say
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:23.600]  Only
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:26.600]  And actually commenting on
[01:19:26.600 --> 01:19:28.600]  FISA's were classified
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.600]  And so you know
[01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:32.600]  If I knew something about it
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:33.600]  I couldn't and I don't
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:35.600]  And again I will just conclude
[01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:37.600]  By saying I stand on what
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:39.600]  I said on the 5th of March
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.600]  Is it possible the president was
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.600]  Picked up in a conversation
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.600]  With Paul Manafort?
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.600]  It's certainly conceivable
[01:19:48.600 --> 01:19:50.600]  Is it likely?
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:52.600]  I can't say
[01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.600]  So now they're trying to let it out
[01:19:54.600 --> 01:19:56.600]  Without being involved in perjury
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:58.600]  Heart disease is on the rise
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.600]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:01.600]  And high cholesterol levels
[01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.600]  May not be fully detected by you
[01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:05.600]  But the symptoms are there
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:07.600]  Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:09.600]  And drops, poor circulation
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.600]  And irregular heartbeat
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:11.600]  Are just a few of these
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.600]  That can alert you
[01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:13.600]  That something is wrong
[01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.600]  Here how heart and body extract
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:16.600]  Is making a difference

[01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:21.600]  My blood pressure has normalized
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.600]  My diabetes has totally improved

[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:26.600]  How much healthier I look

[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:24.600]  So I guess I've got to amend it
[01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.600]  Because I was only clicking on the top link
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:28.600]  That was a link to Media Matters
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.600]  Making the joke that Media Matters
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:32.600]  Run by George Soros and David Brock
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.600]  Says that if Matt Drudge ever links
[01:24:34.600 --> 01:24:37.600]  To any Russian news, he works for the Russians
[01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.600]  But then I didn't even notice
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:42.600]  That the links under it
[01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:46.600]  Are links to Interfax, Itartos and Pravda
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:49.600]  Which again are connected very, very closely
[01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.600]  To the Russian news agency
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:53.600]  You can go ahead and scroll down
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.600]  There it is right there
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.600]  Or just go right to drudgerport.com
[01:24:56.600 --> 01:24:59.600]  And I can show TV viewers
[01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.600]  What I'm talking about that way
[01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:04.600]  But that's the craziness of them trying to tell him
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.600]  We want criminal investigations of you
[01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:08.600]  Which is what the Democrats have called for
[01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:11.600]  Because you link to Russia
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:14.600]  I mean are we in a free country or not?
[01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.600]  And quite frankly a lot of the stuff
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:18.600]  I link to at RT is leftist
[01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.600]  I don't like it
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.600]  Because everybody wants to prove the globalists
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:24.600]  They're nice and it's all this
[01:25:24.600 --> 01:25:27.600]  Pro-government reporting a lot of times
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.600]  Like trying to...
[01:25:29.600 --> 01:25:30.600]  I know for a fact behind the scenes
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:32.600]  They threatened to pull the RT license
[01:25:32.600 --> 01:25:34.600]  And threatened RT years ago
[01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.600]  Not to have me on
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:37.600]  RT doesn't have that big an audience in the US
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:39.600]  Most of the time I won't even go on with RT
[01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:41.600]  Or British television
[01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.600]  I refuse BBC all the time
[01:25:43.600 --> 01:25:45.600]  Japanese, Iranian television
[01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:47.600]  I just don't have time to do it
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.600]  They had me doing it every day
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.600]  But I don't work for the Brazilians
[01:25:51.600 --> 01:25:52.600]  I don't work for the Japanese
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:54.600]  I don't work for the Russians
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:55.600]  But I tell you this
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.600]  I'm not a guy that pulls stunts
[01:25:57.600 --> 01:26:00.600]  But I do want to see Israel
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:03.600]  And I do want to see Russia
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:06.600]  And I think I'm going to plan a trip
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:07.600]  Very, very soon
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:09.600]  A two week trip
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:11.600]  Where I'm going to go for a week to Israel
[01:26:11.600 --> 01:26:13.600]  Everybody says I work for Israel
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:14.600]  When I've been very, very fair
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:16.600]  On both sides of the issue
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:18.600]  And they also say I work for Russia
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:20.600]  And it's a canard
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.600]  But I guess losers out there
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:24.600]  Can't believe somebody else
[01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.600]  Is successful on their own
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.600]  Well, our audience knows that
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.600]  And that's why we are successful
[01:26:30.600 --> 01:26:32.600]  They support us, they spread the word
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:33.600]  They see through the propaganda
[01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:35.600]  But man, I tell you
[01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:37.600]  It is insulting to hear that
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:38.600]  We get our money
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.600]  Or our information from the Russians
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.600]  Hillary finally started getting this
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.600]  Right the last few months
[01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:46.600]  Stop saying that we get it from the Russians
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:49.600]  Now she says they get it from me
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.600]  And now you're telling the truth, lady
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.600]  And I'm not bragging
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.600]  But let's just, let's get down to brass tacks
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:57.600]  The entire America reboot
[01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.600]  Was our audience and our guest
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:01.600]  And the M4s operation
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:03.600]  Promoting Americana
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:04.600]  And comparing it to globalism
[01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.600]  And saying which do you want
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600]  That's the big choice
[01:27:07.600 --> 01:27:10.600]  I've been hammering that for 20 years
[01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.600]  I didn't invent Americana
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:14.600]  I just said, man, it's a lot sexier
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:17.600]  57 Chevy's in Maryland Monroe
[01:27:17.600 --> 01:27:19.600]  And freedom and religious freedom
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:20.600]  And travel wherever you want
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:21.600]  And have low taxes and do
[01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:23.600]  And just prosperity, baby
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.600]  That's a lot better than collectivism
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:29.600]  So we rebooted Americana
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:31.600]  And you did it as an audience
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.600]  That's why I'm hated
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:34.600]  Because they know it's you
[01:27:34.600 --> 01:27:38.600]  And we're just a focal point here in M4s
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.600]  But we really should celebrate the fact that yes
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:45.600]  All over the world from Japan
[01:27:45.600 --> 01:27:48.600]  To Russia to Europe to the UK
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:51.600]  To Mexico to Brazil to South Africa
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:52.600]  All over the world
[01:27:52.600 --> 01:27:54.600]  They're huge listeners of M4s
[01:27:54.600 --> 01:27:56.600]  Max Kaiser working for RT
[01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:57.600]  Also for Al Jazeera
[01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.600]  Doesn't mean he works for the Arabs either
[01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.600]  And he's worked for the BBC
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.600]  He's been all over the world
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.600]  From Asia to Latin America
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.600]  To the Middle East
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.600]  And he says they all run over
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:10.600]  The number one thing is
[01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.600]  We love Alex Jones
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:13.600]  We want to meet Alex Jones
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:14.600]  We love Alex Jones
[01:28:14.600 --> 01:28:16.600]  I even have Muslims in shopping malls
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:17.600]  Come over and shake my hand
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:18.600]  And I realize most Muslims
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.600]  Actually don't want to be under orthodox
[01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:22.600]  Suppressive Wahhabism
[01:28:22.600 --> 01:28:23.600]  They actually want to come here
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:24.600]  And not be bullied
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:26.600]  They're not all bad
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.600]  But the religious ones
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:28.600]  That actually believe it
[01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:29.600]  They're dangerous
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:30.600]  That believe they got to take over
[01:28:30.600 --> 01:28:32.600]  And dominate
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:33.600]  And I used to try the whole
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:34.600]  Carrot approach with Islam
[01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:35.600]  Everybody knows that
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.600]  I used to get accused
[01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:37.600]  Of working for Muslims
[01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:38.600]  Remember all that 10 years ago
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:40.600]  I didn't want to blow up old Middle East
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.600]  I knew it was part of a clash of civilizations
[01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:43.600]  I read the white papers
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:44.600]  Where it was meant to actually
[01:28:44.600 --> 01:28:45.600]  Kick out the non-radicals
[01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:46.600]  Put the radicals in
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:48.600]  And then flood Europe
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:52.600]  I wanted to stop the globalist program
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:54.600]  So again
[01:28:54.600 --> 01:28:56.600]  I don't get
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.600]  My information from Russia
[01:28:58.600 --> 01:29:00.600]  Russia gets their information from me
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:01.600]  And I'm not bragging
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.600]  It's a fact
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.600]  They love Americana
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:04.600]  They want to be free
[01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.600]  They understand
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.600]  We sent the Bolsheviks over there
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.600]  It isn't that they actually
[01:29:08.600 --> 01:29:10.600]  Follow everything I say
[01:29:10.600 --> 01:29:11.600]  They just already know
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:12.600]  What I'm saying is true
[01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:14.600]  And it causes basically
[01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.600]  A affirmation to happen
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:18.600]  And for people to have solidarity
[01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:21.600]  But we've had top Putin advisers
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.600]  On talking about how
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.600]  Info wars has changed Russia
[01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:25.600]  Info wars has changed their view
[01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.600]  Info wars has helped give them
[01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:27.600]  The big picture
[01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:28.600]  They've helped give us
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.600]  The big picture
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:30.600]  And all of us together
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.600]  The UK
[01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.600]  Nigel Farage has said
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:33.600]  On this show three times
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:34.600]  That you kept exploded
[01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:35.600]  After info wars
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.600]  Went into the UK
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:37.600]  It's a fact
[01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.600]  We're winning the war
[01:29:38.600 --> 01:29:40.600]  Because of you the listeners
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.600]  We're on the march
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:48.600]  The Empire's on the run
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:51.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[01:29:57.600 --> 01:29:59.600]  Joe Biggs here with infowars.com
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.600]  With some patriotic quotes by Ron Paul
[01:30:02.600 --> 01:30:03.600]  The most basic principle
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.600]  To being a free American
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:07.600]  Is the notion that we as individuals
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.600]  Are responsible for our own lives
[01:30:10.600 --> 01:30:11.600]  And decisions
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:12.600]  We do not have the right
[01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.600]  To rob our neighbors
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.600]  To make up for our own mistakes
[01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:16.600]  Neither does our neighbor
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.600]  Have any right to tell us how to live
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.600]  So long as we aren't infringing
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:21.600]  On their rights
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:23.600]  Freedom to make bad decisions
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.600]  Is inherent in the freedom
[01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.600]  To make good ones
[01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:27.600]  If we are only free
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:28.600]  To make good decisions
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.600]  Then we are not really free
[01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:32.600]  Liberty is lost through complacency
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:34.600]  In a subservient mindset
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:36.600]  When we accept or even welcome
[01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.600]  Automobile checkpoints
[01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:38.600]  Random searches
[01:30:38.600 --> 01:30:40.600]  Mandatory identification cards
[01:30:40.600 --> 01:30:43.600]  And paramilitary police in our streets
[01:30:43.600 --> 01:30:45.600]  We have lost a vital part
[01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:46.600]  Of our American heritage
[01:30:46.600 --> 01:30:49.600]  America was born of protests
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:51.600]  Revolution and mistrust of government
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:52.600]  Subservient societies
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.600]  Neither maintain nor deserve
[01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.600]  Freedom for long
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:00.600]  You deserve a deep restful sleep

[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:10.600]  L-tryptophan
[01:31:10.600 --> 01:31:12.600]  Lemon balm leaf extract
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:13.600]  And melatonin
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:15.600]  Knockout packs a powerful punch
[01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:16.600]  To get you through the night
[01:31:16.600 --> 01:31:18.600]  And achieve proper sleep

[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:24.600]  But with the rapid speed of life
[01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.600]  We need to be able to keep up the pace

[01:31:57.600 --> 01:31:59.600]  As most of you already know
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:02.600]  I am a voracious consumer of news and information
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.600]  And in the last four or five years
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:06.600]  Doing more and more research
[01:32:06.600 --> 01:32:08.600]  I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:10.600]  Is fully aware of the fact
[01:32:10.600 --> 01:32:12.600]  That our ancient ancestors
[01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:14.600]  In many cases had much better nutrition
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.600]  Than we do today
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:17.600]  And our ancient ancestors
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.600]  Sawed out the bones of the animals
[01:32:19.600 --> 01:32:21.600]  That they were hunting, killing
[01:32:21.600 --> 01:32:22.600]  And then processing
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:24.600]  And so I set out to develop caveman
[01:32:24.600 --> 01:32:27.600]  But to not just have concentrated bone broth
[01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:29.600]  From chicken, but seven other
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:31.600]  Superfood ingredients
[01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600]  Known for cleansing
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:36.600]  And supercharging the body at the same time
[01:32:36.600 --> 01:32:38.600]  Info wars isn't just fighting the globalist
[01:32:38.600 --> 01:32:40.600]  We're getting results
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.600]  And we're expanding in the face
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:44.600]  Of the complete media assault
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:46.600]  And winning because of your support
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.600]  Caveman is back in stock

[01:33:37.600 --> 01:33:39.600]  Al-Qaeda ISIS offensive
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.600]  As thousands of fighters attempted to
[01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:43.600]  Exit the town they were held in
[01:33:43.600 --> 01:33:45.600]  And retake the nearby city
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:47.600]  I'm gonna be getting into that
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:48.600]  Larry Nichols is joining us
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.600]  I intend to open the phones up
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:51.600]  As well throughout the sour into the next
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.600]  When Mark Dice is gonna be joining us
[01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:56.600]  He's a great gravitas and wit
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:58.600]  The toll free number to join us is
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:06.600]  800-2599-231-800-2599-9231
[01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.600]  Some of the news that's up on infowars.com
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.600]  And newswars.com is extremely
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:14.600]  Extremely important
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:17.600]  We're gonna be going over a lot of that
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:19.600]  We have the latest
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.600]  Maxine waters loses it at a funeral
[01:34:21.600 --> 01:34:23.600]  We're gonna be playing that video
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.600]  She is completely out of her mind
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:27.600]  MSNBC worries Trump's use of the word
[01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.600]  Sovereign is racist
[01:34:29.600 --> 01:34:31.600]  We have Brian Williams
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:33.600]  They're presiding the maestro
[01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:35.600]  Of fraud, of fake news
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:37.600]  I mean the arrogance of the system
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:39.600]  But they know they're already caught
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.600]  As a pack of liars
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.600]  And that's a bellwether
[01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.600]  Or a reverse canary in the coal mine
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:46.600]  That they just don't care
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.600]  They know they are fully aware
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:51.600]  Of the fact that you know they're liars
[01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600]  And they're just trying to be disruptive forces
[01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:54.600]  In society
[01:34:54.600 --> 01:34:56.600]  So we'll be getting into that report
[01:34:56.600 --> 01:34:58.600]  We're also going to be
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.600]  Looking at the latest as the Democrats
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:03.600]  Have been forced to come out and admit
[01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:06.600]  That indeed they were spying on Trump associates
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.600]  And on Trump Tower
[01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:09.600]  Something Trump already knows
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:11.600]  He just won't release the classified information
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600]  That's a violation of the law
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600]  They're the ones that illegally spied
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:18.600]  And illegally released the disinformation
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.600]  Meanwhile, Mohammed is now
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:22.600]  The top English baby name
[01:35:22.600 --> 01:35:25.600]  For a fifth year in a row in England
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:27.600]  And by 2040
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600]  England will be majority Muslim
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:32.600]  Just with the Muslim birth rate
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:34.600]  And you will convert
[01:35:34.600 --> 01:35:36.600]  Or you will die
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.600]  And the mayor is taking down pictures of women
[01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.600]  In swimming suits
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:40.600]  Saying that's not allowed
[01:35:40.600 --> 01:35:41.600]  It violates Sharia
[01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.600]  And he says get used to terror
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:44.600]  And now from Germany
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.600]  To Malaysia I have articles
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:47.600]  They're banning beer festivals
[01:35:47.600 --> 01:35:50.600]  Because Muslims don't like it
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.600]  That's all up on newswars.com
[01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:56.600]  Right now and the prime minister
[01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:58.600]  The so-called conservative prime minister
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.600]  Who no one stayed to listen to
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:01.600]  At the UN yesterday
[01:36:01.600 --> 01:36:02.600]  She's so boring
[01:36:02.600 --> 01:36:04.600]  That's how they sabotage conservatism
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:06.600]  As they put another dead fish up there
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:07.600]  She wears her little hijab
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:08.600]  And goes around London
[01:36:08.600 --> 01:36:10.600]  Trying to get the Muslims to like her
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:12.600]  The women are prisoners
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:13.600]  Most women are prisoners
[01:36:13.600 --> 01:36:15.600]  It's a tribal system where
[01:36:15.600 --> 01:36:17.600]  Local Islamic leaders control everybody
[01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:18.600]  It's a slave colony
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600]  That's why Muslims will vote
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.600]  How they're told to vote
[01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.600]  We're bringing in cults into the United States
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:26.600]  And into Europe
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.600]  That are totally incompatible
[01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:29.600]  It's a fact
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.600]  So that's all coming up briefly
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600]  We're going to Larry Nichols
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.600]  I want to just tell listeners
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:38.600]  That I was going to end the 50% off
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:39.600]  On storable food
[01:36:39.600 --> 01:36:41.600]  And again we don't raise the price
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:42.600]  And then lower it
[01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:43.600]  And then say it's 50% off
[01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:45.600]  It's 50% off
[01:36:45.600 --> 01:36:47.600]  The regular discounted price
[01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:49.600]  Of the entire catalog
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:51.600]  Of my patriot supply
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.600]  But I'm contractually through a loophole
[01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:55.600]  That they wouldn't let me do it for a while
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:57.600]  And then they're great folks
[01:36:57.600 --> 01:36:59.600]  The old guys back running into us
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  So this was a real fight
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:03.600]  We're able to do this for you again
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:05.600]  Because Matt Redhawks a great patriot
[01:37:05.600 --> 01:37:07.600]  And actually is willing to have this go out
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:08.600]  At almost a lost leader
[01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:10.600]  He's got to have money to pay the crew
[01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:11.600]  And pay the taxes
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:13.600]  Now this is almost lost leader level
[01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.600]  I don't know how long it can last
[01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:16.600]  Maybe a few days
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:17.600]  Maybe a week
[01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:18.600]  50% off

[01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:02.600]  And North Korea
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:04.600]  And Sorrel's trying to cause a new
[01:38:04.600 --> 01:38:06.600]  Bolshevik Revolution
[01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:09.600]  The key is being self sufficient
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.600]  90% of my energy spent trying to
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:13.600]  Win the war against the globalist
[01:38:13.600 --> 01:38:15.600]  10% is getting a redoubt ready

[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.600]  You name it
[01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:21.600]  Cause we're hoping for the best
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.600]  We're preparing for the worst around here
[01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:25.600]  Cause we're up against some hardcore criminals
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.600]  But it's insurance you can eat
[01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:29.600]  Unlike term or unlike a whole life
[01:38:29.600 --> 01:38:30.600]  Or whatever

[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.600]  That life insurance
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.600]  With food
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:36.600]  Take it with you camping
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:37.600]  Give it away to the Salvation Army
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.600]  In five years
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:39.600]  Everything's okay
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:40.600]  Eat it
[01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:41.600]  Inflation's going up

[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.600]  Or triple eight
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:48.600]  Two five three
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.600]  Three one three nine
[01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:52.600]  And when I tell you that

[01:38:54.600 --> 01:38:55.600]  At my patriot
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:56.600]  It's a metric of the
[01:38:56.600 --> 01:38:58.600]  Highest quality food for the best price
[01:38:58.600 --> 01:39:00.600]  Cause you can obviously pay five times more
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.600]  And get stuff that tastes like gourmet stuff
[01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:03.600]  Out of a restaurant
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:04.600]  This tastes good
[01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:05.600]  Some of it tastes great
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.600]  It's healthy
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:07.600]  It lasts a long time
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:08.600]  It's what I've chosen for my family
[01:39:08.600 --> 01:39:10.600]  That's a metric of the most food
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:12.600]  For the best price
[01:39:12.600 --> 01:39:13.600]  And if 50% off
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:15.600]  You are not going to ever get food
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.600]  At a better price than that
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.600]  The sleep aid
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.600]  This special must end today
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:20.600]  Knockout 40% off
[01:39:20.600 --> 01:39:21.600]  From infowars life

[01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:24.600]  Fluoride free toothpaste
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:26.600]  That special's going to end basically now
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:27.600]  I've been so busy
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.600]  I haven't come up with a new specials
[01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:29.600]  Tim Frosier this morning
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:30.600]  He's going on vacation for a week
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:31.600]  He's like Alex
[01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:33.600]  You got to come up with a new specials
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:34.600]  This is the guy that does this
[01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:36.600]  And I just haven't done it yet
[01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:38.600]  So he's like okay
[01:39:38.600 --> 01:39:39.600]  We're about to sell out of the toothpaste
[01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:41.600]  So it's not good that you sell it out
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:42.600]  At this price you should
[01:39:42.600 --> 01:39:43.600]  You know
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:44.600]  When we're about to sell it anyways

[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:49.600]  That's just not how I think
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:50.600]  It does make sense
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:52.600]  It's about to go back to full price

[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:37.600]  You are thumbing your nose at the globalist
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:38.600]  But you're doing more
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.600]  You're gouging their political eyeballs out
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:43.600]  You are bashing their head
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.600]  Into the concrete, savagely
[01:40:45.600 --> 01:40:46.600]  When you spread the word
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:47.600]  When you spread a video
[01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:48.600]  When you spread an article
[01:40:48.600 --> 01:40:50.600]  You are standing against their censorship
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.600]  You with brute physical force
[01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:55.600]  You are overriding their AI
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:56.600]  You are smashing them
[01:40:56.600 --> 01:40:58.600]  You are crushing them
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:41:01.600]  Hillary just shakes calling me the dark art
[01:41:01.600 --> 01:41:02.600]  Because she knows
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:03.600]  I don't care what she does to me
[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:05.600]  I'm so committed
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:07.600]  It's absolute Valhalla
[01:41:07.600 --> 01:41:08.600]  I'll just be honest with you
[01:41:08.600 --> 01:41:10.600]  Just to run over these people spiritually
[01:41:10.600 --> 01:41:12.600]  With God filling our sails
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:14.600]  Just to absolutely be committed
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.600]  And to feel our will
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:17.600]  Crushing their will
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.600]  It's easy to crush their will
[01:41:19.600 --> 01:41:21.600]  So easy
[01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  How they tricked us into this position
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:23.600]  I'll never understand
[01:41:23.600 --> 01:41:28.600]  It's time to politically crush them
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:30.600]  It's time to break with these bullies
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:32.600]  It's time to let them know
[01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:34.600]  And they know the spirit is rising
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.600]  Now speaking of bullies
[01:41:36.600 --> 01:41:37.600]  I'm going to play this clip
[01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:38.600]  And then play a Shaper clip
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.600]  And then go to Larry Nichols
[01:41:40.600 --> 01:41:43.600]  This is Jimmy Kimmel threatening
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.600]  To assault Fox News
[01:41:44.600 --> 01:41:45.600]  Because Kimmel goes
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:47.600]  Oh, you know, my son has a heart problem
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.600]  He won't get health care
[01:41:48.600 --> 01:41:50.600]  This system will wreck our health care
[01:41:50.600 --> 01:41:52.600]  It's designed to wreck our health care
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:54.600]  That's now admitted by Pocahontas
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:57.600]  And by Ezekiel Emanuel
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:58.600]  And everybody else in Gruber
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:42:00.600]  Said, thank God you're so dumb
[01:42:00.600 --> 01:42:02.600]  It triples prices
[01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.600]  And then they got Kimmel up there
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:05.600]  Reading off a teleprompter
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.600]  He probably believes Obamacare is really free
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.600]  And that money grows on trees
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.600]  And that the tooth fairy is real
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.600]  And so now he's threatening
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:19.600]  To assault someone
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600]  This is the culture
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.600]  What they're being told to push
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.600]  Is let's get aggressive
[01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:24.600]  Let's hashtag hunt Republicans
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:27.600]  Let's shoot congressman's police
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:29.600]  Let's engage in some firebomb throwing
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.600]  Let's intimidate everybody
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.600]  It's not intimidating a scum
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:36.600]  It's causing the opposite reaction, dumbass
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:37.600]  Excuse me
[01:42:37.600 --> 01:42:38.600]  Here's the clip
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.600]  It's politically charged
[01:42:39.600 --> 01:42:41.600]  Damn, these may have been the lowest rate in history
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.600]  But that's not stopping Hollywood elites
[01:42:43.600 --> 01:42:45.600]  Like comedian Jimmy Kimmel
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.600]  For pushing their politics
[01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.600]  On the rest of the country
[01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:48.600]  Watch
[01:42:48.600 --> 01:42:49.600]  Thanks, Brian
[01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.600]  That was Brian Killmeat
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:52.600]  And the reason I found this comment
[01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.600]  To be particularly annoying
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.600]  Is because this is a guy
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.600]  Brian Killmeat
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:56.600]  Who whenever I see him
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.600]  Kisses my ass
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.600]  Like a little boy meetin' Batman
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:01.600]  Oh, he's such a fan
[01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:04.600]  This has been on the show
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:08.600]  He follows me on Twitter
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.600]  He had a blurb for his book
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.600]  Which I did
[01:43:11.600 --> 01:43:12.600]  He calls my agent
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:13.600]  Looking for projects
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:15.600]  He's dying to be a member
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.600]  Of the Hollywood elite
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:17.600]  The only reason he's not a member
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.600]  Of the Hollywood elite
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.600]  Is because nobody will hire him to be one
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:21.600]  And you know
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:22.600]  The reason I'm talking about this
[01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.600]  Is because my son
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:25.600]  Had an open heart surgery
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:26.600]  And has to have two more
[01:43:26.600 --> 01:43:27.600]  And because of that
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:28.600]  I learned that there are kids
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.600]  With no insurance in the same situation
[01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:31.600]  I don't get anything out of this
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:33.600]  Brian, you phony little creep
[01:43:33.600 --> 01:43:35.600]  Oh, I'll pound you when I see you
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:37.600]  That is my blurb
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.600]  Using his kid
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:40.600]  To sell a program
[01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:41.600]  It'll bankrupt the country
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.600]  And take health care from our children
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:46.600]  Brian Killmeat is a phony little creep
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:48.600]  That's right
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:51.600]  Well, I want to tell Jimmy Kimmel
[01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:52.600]  Something right now
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.600]  Brian Killmeat has more viewers than you do
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.600]  A.
[01:44:00.600 --> 01:44:01.600]  And B.
[01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.600]  I've been in major Hollywood films
[01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.600]  And I've been offered starring roles
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:09.600]  On HBO
[01:44:09.600 --> 01:44:11.600]  On
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:12.600]  Everything
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.600]  And guess what I do now
[01:44:14.600 --> 01:44:16.600]  I don't even return the phone calls, buddy
[01:44:16.600 --> 01:44:17.600]  So let me tell you
[01:44:17.600 --> 01:44:19.600]  My enjoyment
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:20.600]  At the end of the day
[01:44:20.600 --> 01:44:21.600]  I don't get off being a quote celebrity
[01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:22.600]  Or being well-known
[01:44:22.600 --> 01:44:25.600]  I get off watching Hollywood die
[01:44:25.600 --> 01:44:27.600]  And watching your whole sick system
[01:44:27.600 --> 01:44:29.600]  Hang on by its fingernails
[01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:30.600]  And by watching all your ratings
[01:44:30.600 --> 01:44:32.600]  Going to the toilet
[01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:35.600]  And by knowing your psychological warfare hold
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.600]  On all of us is almost gone
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.600]  You know, 20 years ago
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:40.600]  Getting put in movies I thought was cool
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:42.600]  And it was a little bit fun
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:43.600]  And you go with your family
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:45.600]  The movie and there you are in the movie
[01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:49.600]  You know what my big pleasure is
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:52.600]  My big pleasure is saying
[01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:55.600]  I don't want that major supporting role
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.600]  In a science fiction movie
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:01.600]  I don't want that major role in a western
[01:45:01.600 --> 01:45:04.600]  I don't want a major role in your political thriller
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.600]  I'm going to go do a super cheesy B movie
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:09.600]  With a bunch of weirdos in Texas
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.600]  Because it's funny
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:13.600]  And then I'm going to sit there and put it on TV
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:14.600]  And I'm going to laugh at it with my kids
[01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.600]  It's fun
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.600]  The kind of movies I'm in
[01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.600]  Because you understand
[01:45:19.600 --> 01:45:21.600]  Turning down the big slick role
[01:45:21.600 --> 01:45:23.600]  And then going and doing the little underground thing
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:25.600]  It's just
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:27.600]  It's what rock and roll wishes it was
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:31.600]  See, John Wayne was an actor
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.600]  And a patriot and a great guy
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:34.600]  But he's still just an actor
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:37.600]  But there is that real image of John Wayne
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:38.600]  That's the Americana
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  And I want that, you see
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:42.600]  I want to never give in, never back down
[01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.600]  Never roll over
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:46.600]  And I want to put on my tombstone
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:48.600]  That he hammered their asses
[01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:51.600]  That I took out the tyrants
[01:45:51.600 --> 01:45:53.600]  That I ran over the scum
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:55.600]  That I stood up against the pedophiles
[01:45:55.600 --> 01:45:56.600]  Not because I was some hero
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.600]  But because my instincts were straight
[01:45:58.600 --> 01:46:00.600]  I was lined up with God as my North Star
[01:46:00.600 --> 01:46:02.600]  You couldn't keep me away
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:05.600]  From getting my hands around these people's necks politically
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:07.600]  So Kimmel really has got a big one
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.600]  Where he talks about his son and his heart surgery
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:11.600]  Kimmel, I care about you and your son
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:13.600]  And I hope you research how GMO
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.600]  In all rat species
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:17.600]  And in all rodent species
[01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:18.600]  And in all mammal species
[01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.600]  Is linked to causing all sorts of heart valve defects
[01:46:21.600 --> 01:46:22.600]  That's where you start getting
[01:46:22.600 --> 01:46:24.600]  Is where the body kind of folds in
[01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:25.600]  During embryonic development
[01:46:25.600 --> 01:46:27.600]  That's why you get hair lips
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:29.600]  That's why a lot of them's hair lips
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:31.600]  Are associated with heart defects as well
[01:46:31.600 --> 01:46:34.600]  Because the body's semen up those little things
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.600]  And if there's toxins, if there's GMO
[01:46:36.600 --> 01:46:38.600]  If there's vaccines, if your wife
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:40.600]  Took a vaccine during the first trimester
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:42.600]  I've got the big studies I covered them yesterday
[01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:44.600]  Even CNN had mentioned massive
[01:46:44.600 --> 01:46:47.600]  Increase in heart valve defects
[01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:49.600]  So Kimmel, why don't you tell people
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:52.600]  About the vaccines? I bet you don't know
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:55.600]  The media will say, Jones makes fun of Kimmel's son
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.600]  And his heart defect
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:57.600]  No, I care about your son
[01:46:57.600 --> 01:46:59.600]  And all the other kids that are getting the heart defects
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:01.600]  That are all way up, Kimmel
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:03.600]  So why don't you stop beating up
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.600]  On one of the little candy asses
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:07.600]  Over there at Fox News
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:10.600]  And stop using your son
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.600]  To talk about how you're going to kick people's asses
[01:47:12.600 --> 01:47:13.600]  To promote violence in America
[01:47:13.600 --> 01:47:15.600]  How about that? How about you actually help some kids, buddy
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.600]  Instead of using your kid
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:19.600]  Instead of pimping your kid out there
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:22.600]  To push Obamacare that's designed to wreck healthcare
[01:47:22.600 --> 01:47:23.600]  Now, maybe you don't know what you're doing
[01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:24.600]  And that's okay
[01:47:24.600 --> 01:47:26.600]  So we forgive you
[01:47:26.600 --> 01:47:29.600]  Kimmel, good
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:32.600]  Now
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.600]  By the way, let me just say this
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.600]  I don't want to go on Kimmel's show
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:37.600]  I don't want to go on The Daily Show
[01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:38.600]  I don't want to go on any of them
[01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:40.600]  And we've had offers before to go on these shows
[01:47:40.600 --> 01:47:42.600]  I'm not going... I piss on your...
[01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:43.600]  You're not real shows
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:45.600]  You're frauds, you're crap
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:47.600]  You're the enemy, you're cancer
[01:47:47.600 --> 01:47:49.600]  You're grandma dying of a heart attack
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.600]  You're grandpa with a brain tumor
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:53.600]  You're failure, you're betrayal
[01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.600]  You're anathema, you're a blaspheme
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:47:59.600]  And you will fall
[01:47:59.600 --> 01:48:01.600]  You're already falling right now
[01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:05.600]  I'm sorry for your son
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.600]  Did your wife take the vaccines?
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.600]  Been slurping that tap water?
[01:48:11.600 --> 01:48:13.600]  Why don't you find out why this is happening?
[01:48:13.600 --> 01:48:15.600]  Why don't you actually save other kids
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:17.600]  Instead of using your kid to bring in socialism
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:20.600]  And globalist control for big fat cat corporations
[01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:23.600]  That want to make us buy overpriced healthcare?
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:25.600]  How about that?
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:27.600]  You ever seen my little kids on TV?
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:29.600]  Other than my son likes to go on?
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:31.600]  Have I used my five month old daughter
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:33.600]  And Twitter in the Facebook?
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:35.600]  Maybe I should because she's so cute
[01:48:35.600 --> 01:48:37.600]  I love her, proud of her
[01:48:37.600 --> 01:48:39.600]  Just stop it
[01:48:39.600 --> 01:48:41.600]  Stop talking about how you want to do violence against somebody
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:43.600]  I'm going to shut up little Larry Nichols
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:45.600]  We'll put up his website as well
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.600]  Larry, what's the latest?
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.600]  What's the big developments you've got
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:51.600]  Unfolding in this world?
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.600]  Larry Nichols
[01:48:53.600 --> 01:48:55.600]  Well, Alex, a lot's going on
[01:48:55.600 --> 01:48:57.600]  A lot's going on behind the scenes
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:48:59.600]  He's moving at breakneck speed now
[01:48:59.600 --> 01:49:01.600]  As you know, you're in the hurricanes
[01:49:01.600 --> 01:49:03.600]  Which is always what they do
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:05.600]  When everybody's looking at the hurricanes
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.600]  Paying attention to that
[01:49:07.600 --> 01:49:09.600]  They're slipping around in the dark
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:11.600]  And nobody sees them
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.600]  He's now going after
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:15.600]  He has gone after documents
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:17.600]  In the White House
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:19.600]  He's going after
[01:49:19.600 --> 01:49:21.600]  Anything in the White House
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:23.600]  That has to do with Colby's fire
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.600]  And talk about Rogue, they're admitting
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:27.600]  It's done, it's the most aggressive thing
[01:49:27.600 --> 01:49:29.600]  They're grabbing stuff that aren't even in search warrants
[01:49:29.600 --> 01:49:31.600]  They're demanding everybody's communication
[01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:33.600]  I mean, Mueller is the Lord High Executioner
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.600]  Absolutely
[01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:37.600]  And folks, Alex, I'm telling you
[01:49:37.600 --> 01:49:39.600]  It's written all over
[01:49:39.600 --> 01:49:41.600]  You can see it
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:43.600]  They're coming after Trump
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:45.600]  With impeachment
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:47.600]  They've got impeachment
[01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:49.600]  They've got to get him
[01:49:49.600 --> 01:49:51.600]  I agree, but let me bring this up
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:53.600]  Mueller is so corrupt covering up for the Clintons
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:55.600]  And Comey
[01:49:55.600 --> 01:49:57.600]  Is it the move to indict
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:59.600]  Or start the indictment of Comey
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:01.600]  For leaking classified information
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:03.600]  Trump should just absolutely run over
[01:50:03.600 --> 01:50:05.600]  These people politically
[01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:07.600]  Mueller is an arrogant sack of crap
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:09.600]  Well, the problem
[01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:11.600]  That Trump has, as you know
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:13.600]  Other than this program
[01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:15.600]  In alternative media
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:17.600]  He has no voice
[01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:19.600]  And remember, y'all
[01:50:19.600 --> 01:50:21.600]  This is what hurts
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.600]  Still to this day
[01:50:23.600 --> 01:50:25.600]  Probably 95 to 98%
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.600]  Of the people in this country of voting age
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:29.600]  Get everything they think they need
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:31.600]  From the news
[01:50:31.600 --> 01:50:33.600]  In their 6 and 10 o'clock TV news
[01:50:33.600 --> 01:50:35.600]  And if that's all you use
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.600]  Let me tell you
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:39.600]  If you want 6 and 10 o'clock news
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:41.600]  Alex, you realize
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:43.600]  In those local newscasts
[01:50:43.600 --> 01:50:45.600]  You get 4 to 7 minutes
[01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:47.600]  Of national news
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.600]  Larry, it's worse than that
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:51.600]  They had deactivated
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.600]  80% of the public
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.600]  That never watches news
[01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.600]  Who weren't even voters
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.600]  Weren't even involved in the political process
[01:50:59.600 --> 01:51:01.600]  Most of the time
[01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:03.600]  They're now weaponizing all the entertainment shows
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:05.600]  Putting this info out in those
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:07.600]  They're activating
[01:51:07.600 --> 01:51:09.600]  First they tried to turn the public off from politics
[01:51:09.600 --> 01:51:11.600]  Now they're trying to activate the zombies
[01:51:11.600 --> 01:51:13.600]  That's right
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:15.600]  If you look at what they're doing
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:17.600]  With all of their programming
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.600]  To what
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:21.600]  To do what they've been doing
[01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:23.600]  To our kids in school
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:25.600]  You know, it's nothing
[01:51:25.600 --> 01:51:27.600]  But brainwashing
[01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:29.600]  If you watch the entertainment shows
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.600]  You're being brainwashed
[01:51:31.600 --> 01:51:33.600]  And I'm talking about the dramas
[01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:35.600]  The comedies
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:37.600]  Why are they now coming out admitting
[01:51:37.600 --> 01:51:39.600]  That Trump Tower was spot on
[01:51:39.600 --> 01:51:41.600]  That Trump was spot on metaphor
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.600]  Because they're getting ready to try to use
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:45.600]  The phony contacts they got through those phone calls
[01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:47.600]  They're about to use the wiretapping
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.600]  They said didn't exist
[01:51:49.600 --> 01:51:51.600]  That's right, they have to declare it
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:53.600]  Because they're going to use
[01:51:53.600 --> 01:51:55.600]  Illegally obtained wiretaps
[01:51:55.600 --> 01:51:57.600]  To impeach President Trump
[01:51:57.600 --> 01:51:59.600]  Well
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.600]  We talked about it before
[01:52:01.600 --> 01:52:03.600]  But Alex is getting serious
[01:52:03.600 --> 01:52:05.600]  As you're pointing out
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.600]  What you're saying right now is 100%
[01:52:07.600 --> 01:52:09.600]  The truth
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.600]  100%
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:13.600]  They're all in
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.600]  Everything for them
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:17.600]  They win
[01:52:17.600 --> 01:52:19.600]  As far as they're concerned
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.600]  They lose and it's over
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:23.600]  They're playing every chip they got
[01:52:23.600 --> 01:52:25.600]  Every move they got
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.600]  Down to
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:29.600]  My god, you would think
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:31.600]  The entertainment industry
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:33.600]  Just like you were talking about
[01:52:33.600 --> 01:52:35.600]  You would think the entertainment industry
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:37.600]  Would sit back and say golly gee
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.600]  You know, the comedies
[01:52:39.600 --> 01:52:41.600]  The programming we're doing
[01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:43.600]  Is losing viewers left to right
[01:52:43.600 --> 01:52:45.600]  They don't care because they plan a total overthrow
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:47.600]  I mean, you're right, their whole posture is
[01:52:47.600 --> 01:52:49.600]  Total overthrow, we're not backing down
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:51.600]  They're going to try to overthrow
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:53.600]  The political realignment, bring in a Venezuelan
[01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.600]  Control arm
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:57.600]  Have fake elections here on and how do we know that
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:59.600]  They've said it in their elite publications
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:01.600]  Like Atlantic Monthly
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:03.600]  And you saw Hillary
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:05.600]  Two days ago say she still plans
[01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:07.600]  To overturn the election
[01:53:07.600 --> 01:53:09.600]  That's right
[01:53:09.600 --> 01:53:11.600]  All it's going to take
[01:53:11.600 --> 01:53:13.600]  Is Mueller through his fake grand jury
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:15.600]  To bring impeachment
[01:53:15.600 --> 01:53:17.600]  To the House of Representatives
[01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:19.600]  And they know
[01:53:19.600 --> 01:53:21.600]  They know that the Republicans
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:23.600]  In the House are a bunch of cowards
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:25.600]  Cowards, you bet, they're cowards
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:27.600]  And the leadership
[01:53:27.600 --> 01:53:29.600]  They're traders
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:31.600]  Now, that's why we got the plan
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.600]  The only plan that I see
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:35.600]  Vival
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:37.600]  There's nothing Alex you and I can do to stop
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:39.600]  Mueller from impeaching Trump
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.600]  Method
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:43.600]  But here's what we can do
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:45.600]  If he takes that to the House
[01:53:45.600 --> 01:53:47.600]  To get them to hold an impeachment hearing
[01:53:47.600 --> 01:53:49.600]  We can stop them
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:51.600]  We can stop them cold
[01:53:51.600 --> 01:53:53.600]  Because folks, the math
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:55.600]  I hate to tell everybody
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:53:57.600]  The math is on our side
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.600]  And by the way, we got to get this going now
[01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.600]  No impeachment of Trump
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:03.600]  Indictment of Mueller, indictment of Comey
[01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.600]  Indictment of Hillary
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.600]  Trump, every time I talk to him I say
[01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.600]  Sir, they're never going to stop
[01:54:09.600 --> 01:54:11.600]  You've got to indict Hillary
[01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:13.600]  And he knows that and he goes to sessions
[01:54:13.600 --> 01:54:15.600]  And I know you know sessions
[01:54:15.600 --> 01:54:17.600]  And I'm going to leave it at that
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.600]  Sessions has been a good guy
[01:54:19.600 --> 01:54:21.600]  What is his problem?
[01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.600]  Alex, the problem
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.600]  The problem with Jeff Sessions
[01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.600]  Is this
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:29.600]  He turns around
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:31.600]  He doesn't do the prosecuting himself
[01:54:31.600 --> 01:54:33.600]  And when he turns around
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:35.600]  They all refuse to do what he says
[01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:37.600]  Because he's stuck between the Bush
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:39.600]  And the Clinton and the Obama
[01:54:39.600 --> 01:54:41.600]  He's got three to four administrations
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.600]  Of bad people in there
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:45.600]  He's totally surrounded
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.600]  He's surrounded
[01:54:47.600 --> 01:54:49.600]  The same thing happens with Trump
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:51.600]  Trump's trying to do the agenda
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:53.600]  He's set forth in his campaign
[01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.600]  But he turns around and he stabs him in the back
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:57.600]  Not the Democrats, you're doing the crap
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.600]  By the way, anybody that's ever run
[01:54:59.600 --> 01:55:01.600]  Even a small company or a medium company
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.600]  Knows even when you have good people
[01:55:03.600 --> 01:55:05.600]  It's hard to get them all going in the same direction
[01:55:05.600 --> 01:55:07.600]  Imagine tens of thousands of people
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.600]  That are political operatives in D.C. Scum
[01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.600]  Who hate you and think you're about to be gone
[01:55:11.600 --> 01:55:13.600]  They are all lockstep in mutiny
[01:55:13.600 --> 01:55:15.600]  So what do we the people do?
[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:17.600]  Alright
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.600]  First off, I want to make a statement
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.600]  If I may to the Republicans
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:23.600]  To every Republican
[01:55:23.600 --> 01:55:25.600]  In the House of Representatives
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.600]  I make this pledge to you today
[01:55:27.600 --> 01:55:29.600]  Right here with Alex Young
[01:55:29.600 --> 01:55:31.600]  I will
[01:55:31.600 --> 01:55:33.600]  Use the
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:35.600]  Information that I have on every one of you
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:37.600]  Every one of you and I will destroy
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.600]  Every one of you
[01:55:39.600 --> 01:55:41.600]  There is such a problem
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:43.600]  The problem now is with Republicans
[01:55:43.600 --> 01:55:45.600]  Is they're conservative, supposedly
[01:55:45.600 --> 01:55:47.600]  They're moral, supposedly
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:49.600]  They're Christians, supposedly
[01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:51.600]  And most of them they put sex ops on
[01:55:51.600 --> 01:55:53.600]  And most of them are cheating on their wives
[01:55:53.600 --> 01:55:55.600]  And worse, cheating on their wives
[01:55:55.600 --> 01:55:57.600]  I know who their girlfriends are
[01:55:57.600 --> 01:55:59.600]  Or more friends
[01:55:59.600 --> 01:56:01.600]  I know who their illegitimate babies are
[01:56:01.600 --> 01:56:03.600]  I know which ones are
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:05.600]  Alcoholics, which ones are drugies
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.600]  Even what their drugs and
[01:56:07.600 --> 01:56:09.600]  Preference are
[01:56:09.600 --> 01:56:11.600]  So here's the promise Republicans
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:13.600]  Very soon
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.600]  You're going to receive
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:17.600]  Thousands, thousands of phone calls
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:19.600]  In your state office
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:21.600]  In your national office
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:23.600]  Federal office in Washington
[01:56:23.600 --> 01:56:25.600]  And it's going to meet people reading the script
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.600]  Telling you
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:29.600]  That you must stop
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:31.600]  The impeachment of President Trump
[01:56:31.600 --> 01:56:33.600]  They all know it's a bogus case
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:35.600]  Everyone knows it
[01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:37.600]  And if they don't
[01:56:37.600 --> 01:56:39.600]  If they don't
[01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:41.600]  I pledge right here
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:43.600]  On the word that I gave Bill Clinton
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:45.600]  In 1990
[01:56:45.600 --> 01:56:47.600]  I'll destroy you
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.600]  And I don't mean just keep open being a
[01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:51.600]  And all of us give that pledge and you did tell them
[01:56:51.600 --> 01:56:53.600]  Underneath that overpass
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:55.600]  You were down there by the river where they buried the bodies
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:57.600]  I damn pure did
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:56:59.600]  And I'm telling them off
[01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.600]  You don't believe I'll do it
[01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:03.600]  You better dial 1-800-BILL in Hillary Clinton
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:05.600]  And ask them
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:07.600]  But let me throw this out right now
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.600]  You are 100% correct
[01:57:09.600 --> 01:57:11.600]  You've been standing for eight months
[01:57:11.600 --> 01:57:13.600]  They're going to cook it up
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:15.600]  They never found any rushes
[01:57:15.600 --> 01:57:17.600]  And now it's going to be taxes or this or that
[01:57:17.600 --> 01:57:19.600]  And I didn't dot it
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:21.600]  T didn't cross
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.600]  We are with all their criminal coverups
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:25.600]  Hillary doesn't get in trouble
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.600]  It's Trump with made up crap
[01:57:27.600 --> 01:57:29.600]  You're right
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:31.600]  We can't wait to get on this impeachment once it starts
[01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:33.600]  We've got to be hammering them
[01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:35.600]  Now every day
[01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:37.600]  Hammer, hammer, hammer
[01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.600]  You're not going to overturn our election
[01:57:39.600 --> 01:57:41.600]  You're not going to
[01:57:41.600 --> 01:57:43.600]  Just like a jury can veto a judge or whatever
[01:57:43.600 --> 01:57:45.600]  We have got to have the American people know
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.600]  We voted Trump in
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:49.600]  Not the Russians
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:51.600]  And we're vetoing all these traitors
[01:57:51.600 --> 01:57:53.600]  They say he's able for saying America first
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.600]  At the UN
[01:57:55.600 --> 01:57:57.600]  They're obviously the enemies
[01:57:57.600 --> 01:57:59.600]  That's why they're pissed
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:01.600]  It's because we have an American president
[01:58:01.600 --> 01:58:03.600]  And it doesn't mean he's perfect
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.600]  But he's not out to get the country
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:07.600]  And that's why they hate him
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:09.600]  And Robert Hewlett
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:11.600]  Don't believe that I haven't been able
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.600]  To acquire a whole bunch of dirt on you buddy
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.600]  Now I know
[01:58:15.600 --> 01:58:17.600]  Alex I know they're going to destroy me
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:19.600]  Fine
[01:58:19.600 --> 01:58:21.600]  And by the way this is Alex Jones
[01:58:21.600 --> 01:58:23.600]  This is me
[01:58:23.600 --> 01:58:25.600]  But I swear to God
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:27.600]  For God almighty
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:29.600]  I will not let y'all destroy this country
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:31.600]  Now
[01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:33.600]  Hold on Larry let's come back in 70 seconds
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:49.600]  We'll take some phone calls as well
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:05.600]  100% organic mustard seed
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:07.600]  Our super high quality nascent iodine
[01:59:07.600 --> 01:59:09.600]  Is an essential mineral
[01:59:09.600 --> 01:59:11.600]  Sourced of 99.99%
[01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:13.600]  Ultra pure deep earth iodine crystals
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:15.600]  This essential mineral
[01:59:15.600 --> 01:59:17.600]  Is necessary in order to produce
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.600]  Thyroid hormones which influence
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:21.600]  Every cell tissue and organ in the body
[01:59:21.600 --> 01:59:23.600]  With inadequate thyroid hormones
[01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.600]  You may experience slow metabolism
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:27.600]  Lethargy, weight gain
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.600]  And overall brain fog

[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:51.600]  You're listening to the
[01:59:51.600 --> 02:00:05.600]  Alex Jones show
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:07.600]  From the front lines
[02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.600]  Of the information war
[02:00:09.600 --> 02:00:11.600]  It's Alex Jones
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:13.600]  Out of my way
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:15.600]  Out of my day
[02:00:15.600 --> 02:00:17.600]  Out of your mind
[02:00:17.600 --> 02:00:19.600]  And into my head
[02:00:19.600 --> 02:00:21.600]  Kevin
[02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:23.600]  He wants to talk about artificial intelligence
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:25.600]  George wants to talk about local level involvement
[02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:27.600]  Jesse wants to talk about geoengineering
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:29.600]  Melissa I kind of got behind here
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:31.600]  But I'm going to be getting to your calls
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:33.600]  Melissa wants to talk about vaccines but
[02:00:33.600 --> 02:00:35.600]  All of these agendas that are going on out there
[02:00:35.600 --> 02:00:37.600]  Orbit around the fact that
[02:00:37.600 --> 02:00:39.600]  If we get our country back
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.600]  Under the control of our own government
[02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.600]  And not special interest
[02:00:43.600 --> 02:00:45.600]  Then we can fix all those problems
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.600]  But Larry
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:49.600]  You've seen the arrogance of Hillary
[02:00:49.600 --> 02:00:51.600]  Thinking she was going to win
[02:00:51.600 --> 02:00:53.600]  And heard now saying on three different programs
[02:00:53.600 --> 02:00:55.600]  They plan to overturn the election
[02:00:55.600 --> 02:00:57.600]  I hope the cowardly republicans know
[02:00:57.600 --> 02:00:59.600]  If they just read the financial times
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:01.600]  Or the COG article out of Atlantic Monthly
[02:01:01.600 --> 02:01:03.600]  Their plan or foreign affairs
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:05.600]  Or public affairs
[02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:07.600]  They have all four written articles
[02:01:07.600 --> 02:01:09.600]  Saying the same thing
[02:01:09.600 --> 02:01:11.600]  COG bring government under a civil emergency
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:13.600]  Under COG have this shadow government
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:15.600]  That administer the new election
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:17.600]  And then we never have a real election again
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:19.600]  And they said all the republicans
[02:01:19.600 --> 02:01:21.600]  That were in the last election
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:23.600]  Will be removed
[02:01:23.600 --> 02:01:25.600]  And will be under a new election
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:27.600]  That's why Obama signed that executive order
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:29.600]  Federalizing elections
[02:01:29.600 --> 02:01:31.600]  That all 50 attorney generals including Democrats
[02:01:31.600 --> 02:01:33.600]  Said no to
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:35.600]  I mean this isn't as plain as the nose on your face Larry
[02:01:35.600 --> 02:01:37.600]  They've stated their battle plan
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:39.600]  Absolutely but again
[02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:41.600]  Remember
[02:01:41.600 --> 02:01:43.600]  This is what I've got to convince
[02:01:43.600 --> 02:01:45.600]  We have the math on our side
[02:01:45.600 --> 02:01:47.600]  And republican congressmen
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.600]  You better hear this
[02:01:49.600 --> 02:01:51.600]  You don't have
[02:01:51.600 --> 02:01:53.600]  A base of support
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:55.600]  Donald Trump

[02:01:59.600 --> 02:02:01.600]  Since Ronald Reagan
[02:02:01.600 --> 02:02:03.600]  Was the lesser of two evils
[02:02:03.600 --> 02:02:05.600]  President Trump
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:07.600]  Owns
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:09.600]  The republican party
[02:02:09.600 --> 02:02:11.600]  In this upcoming primary
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:13.600]  And we will pick

[02:02:27.600 --> 02:02:29.600]  We're going to prove
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:31.600]  No you're right
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:33.600]  I mean listen
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:35.600]  Ryan's hanging on by his fingernails
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:37.600]  We've got to pick some mid level ones that have been cowardly
[02:02:37.600 --> 02:02:39.600]  And burn them so the others
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:41.600]  Understand you fear

[02:03:17.600 --> 02:03:19.600]  It's here everything we've warned of

[02:03:39.600 --> 02:03:41.600]  Some of them have said they've thrown
[02:03:41.600 --> 02:03:43.600]  Them out of their homes

[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:01.600]  The next move is just have them run for office

[02:09:13.600 --> 02:09:15.600]  I don't know, doing media stuff
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:17.600]  For at least 12, 13 years
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:19.600]  He's got a degree in radio, television, film
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:21.600]  And he's a media analyst
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:23.600]  And he has millions of viewers a day
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:25.600]  It's so exciting just to see
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:27.600]  He's always been successful
[02:09:27.600 --> 02:09:29.600]  Publishing books and reaching millions of people
[02:09:29.600 --> 02:09:31.600]  On YouTube and they would ban his YouTube channel
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:33.600]  And we would support him when that was happening
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:35.600]  So we've been through this internship a long time together
[02:09:35.600 --> 02:09:37.600]  And famously he'd call talk radio shows
[02:09:37.600 --> 02:09:39.600]  And bring up Bohemian Grove and things like that
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:41.600]  But now he really has hit his stride
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:43.600]  And he's doing master works
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.600]  Of real news exposing fake news
[02:09:45.600 --> 02:09:47.600]  And his trolling and his memes
[02:09:47.600 --> 02:09:49.600]  And just everything he does
[02:09:49.600 --> 02:09:51.600]  Is just amazing
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:53.600]  So it's so good to have him here with us
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:55.600]  For the hour
[02:09:55.600 --> 02:09:57.600]  Mark, obviously I've got a lot of issues
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.600]  To cover and all the questions I have for you
[02:09:59.600 --> 02:10:01.600]  But where do you want to start first?
[02:10:01.600 --> 02:10:03.600]  I mean, they're saying Matt Drudge is a Russian agent
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:05.600]  They're saying Trump's racist
[02:10:05.600 --> 02:10:07.600]  Because he talked about sovereignty
[02:10:07.600 --> 02:10:09.600]  And he's saying he's talking about
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:11.600]  He talked about sovereignty
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:13.600]  Brian Williams is back on TV
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:15.600]  Even though he's the king of fake news
[02:10:15.600 --> 02:10:17.600]  You've got Kimmel saying
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:19.600]  He wants to beat people up
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:21.600]  They're trying to invoke
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:23.600]  Assault on folks
[02:10:23.600 --> 02:10:25.600]  I mean, we're in the middle of like a culture war
[02:10:25.600 --> 02:10:27.600]  A civil war
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:29.600]  What would you call this time and space
[02:10:29.600 --> 02:10:31.600]  Were in A and B
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:33.600]  How is team sanity
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.600]  Team common sense
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:37.600]  I would even call it conservatives
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:39.600]  Free market
[02:10:39.600 --> 02:10:41.600]  A team reality
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:43.600]  How is team reality doing?
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:45.600]  I mean, we're on the verge of an Orwellian nightmare
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:47.600]  Where people are being disconnected from the truth
[02:10:47.600 --> 02:10:49.600]  So they don't even know which way is up
[02:10:49.600 --> 02:10:51.600]  I've been doing this so long
[02:10:51.600 --> 02:10:53.600]  That I remember back in the day
[02:10:53.600 --> 02:10:55.600]  When Jimmy Kimmel was actually a comedian
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:57.600]  And now obviously he's just a liberal propagandist
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:10:59.600]  We're seeing this strange attack
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:01.600]  Against traditional
[02:11:01.600 --> 02:11:03.600]  Or independent
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:05.600]  Small media outlets
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:07.600]  YouTube channels
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:09.600]  Rising big news outlets
[02:11:09.600 --> 02:11:11.600]  Like yourself because there's no coincidence
[02:11:11.600 --> 02:11:13.600]  That right after the election
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:15.600]  They launched this attack on the media
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:17.600]  Of course blaming fake news and the Russian conspiracy
[02:11:17.600 --> 02:11:19.600]  And this is coincidentally
[02:11:19.600 --> 02:11:21.600]  Or not coincidentally rather
[02:11:21.600 --> 02:11:23.600]  Coinciding with the rise of
[02:11:23.600 --> 02:11:25.600]  Social media personalities
[02:11:25.600 --> 02:11:27.600]  New independent companies
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.600]  Using the social media technology
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:31.600]  Because Facebook transitioned from
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:33.600]  A social networking company
[02:11:33.600 --> 02:11:35.600]  To a news company
[02:11:35.600 --> 02:11:37.600]  When they introduced their trending topics
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:39.600]  Now they suggest which stories they think
[02:11:39.600 --> 02:11:41.600]  People would be interested in
[02:11:41.600 --> 02:11:43.600]  As opposed to people just sharing
[02:11:43.600 --> 02:11:45.600]  What they want to with their friends
[02:11:45.600 --> 02:11:47.600]  And YouTube transitioned from
[02:11:47.600 --> 02:11:49.600]  A place to post funny cat videos
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:51.600]  Or little clips of
[02:11:51.600 --> 02:11:53.600]  Charlie biting his brother's finger
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:55.600]  You may recall that viral video
[02:11:55.600 --> 02:11:57.600]  To companies like you
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:59.600]  And personalities like me
[02:11:59.600 --> 02:12:01.600]  Who are now dominating the mainstream media
[02:12:01.600 --> 02:12:03.600]  And it's probably just us
[02:12:03.600 --> 02:12:05.600]  It's thousands of smaller
[02:12:05.600 --> 02:12:07.600]  Smaller channels and so we're seeing
[02:12:07.600 --> 02:12:09.600]  Some new censorship rolling out
[02:12:09.600 --> 02:12:11.600]  They're trying to remove the financial
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:13.600]  Incentives of people
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:15.600]  Like me on YouTube demonetizing
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:17.600]  Virtually every one of our channels
[02:12:17.600 --> 02:12:19.600]  Every one of our videos their censorship
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:21.600]  Is so specific now Alex
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.600]  That there are many people
[02:12:23.600 --> 02:12:25.600]  Don't know this but when someone uploads
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:27.600]  A video to YouTube it's automatically
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:29.600]  Transcribed and you can actually
[02:12:29.600 --> 02:12:31.600]  Go and see the transcripts
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:33.600]  So their AI transcribes
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:35.600]  What is said in the video
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:37.600]  And so now if you just talk
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:39.600]  About certain things in the video
[02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:41.600]  It's automatically most of my videos
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:43.600]  Now are demonetized as soon as I upload them
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:45.600]  They're done processing
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:47.600]  Immediately demonetized
[02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:49.600]  Before any titles, before any tags
[02:12:49.600 --> 02:12:51.600]  Before any descriptions
[02:12:51.600 --> 02:12:53.600]  So it used to be that if you
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:55.600]  Were to title a video something
[02:12:55.600 --> 02:12:57.600]  Having to do with terrorism or police
[02:12:57.600 --> 02:12:59.600]  Or have some descriptions
[02:12:59.600 --> 02:13:01.600]  In there about with some keywords
[02:13:01.600 --> 02:13:03.600]  That they felt were sensitive
[02:13:03.600 --> 02:13:05.600]  Or violence or sexual content
[02:13:05.600 --> 02:13:07.600]  They would automatically
[02:13:07.600 --> 02:13:09.600]  Demonetize it but now
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:11.600]  It is off of what is
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:13.600]  Actually said in the videos
[02:13:13.600 --> 02:13:15.600]  Based off of their transcripts
[02:13:15.600 --> 02:13:17.600]  It's getting very scary because we're seeing
[02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.600]  Them trying to remove websites
[02:13:19.600 --> 02:13:21.600]  Alternative to Twitter, GAB
[02:13:21.600 --> 02:13:23.600]  The social media network I know you just had
[02:13:23.600 --> 02:13:25.600]  Your CEO Andrew Torba on earlier this week
[02:13:25.600 --> 02:13:27.600]  This is a very scary time
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:29.600]  And that's why it's not time to sit back
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:31.600]  And relax, we have to really
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:33.600]  Triple our efforts because this
[02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:35.600]  We may be in the last few
[02:13:35.600 --> 02:13:37.600]  Months or years of
[02:13:37.600 --> 02:13:39.600]  The free internet that we've all or that
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:41.600]  Many of us have grown up with
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:43.600]  It's the best of times, worst of times
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:45.600]  It's because you've been so effective
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:47.600]  I've been so effective, Drudge has
[02:13:47.600 --> 02:13:49.600]  Been so effective, all these
[02:13:49.600 --> 02:13:51.600]  Thousands of new rising channels
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:53.600]  That reach hundreds of thousands a day
[02:13:53.600 --> 02:13:55.600]  Millions a week smaller channels
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:57.600]  Tens of millions a week like your channel
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:59.600]  Same thing with our channels
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:01.600]  And we're winning the culture war so they're saying
[02:14:01.600 --> 02:14:03.600]  We're going to censor you
[02:14:03.600 --> 02:14:05.600]  We're going to demonetize you
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:07.600]  And we're like okay take the money and they're like
[02:14:07.600 --> 02:14:09.600]  No you don't understand, we're not going to let people really share your videos anymore
[02:14:09.600 --> 02:14:11.600]  But despite that people still
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:13.600]  Hand share our videos
[02:14:13.600 --> 02:14:15.600]  They hand share your videos so still
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:17.600]  We're rising and the globalists are panicking
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:19.600]  So as you know last week Zuckerberg came out
[02:14:19.600 --> 02:14:21.600]  And said the next year he's going to spend
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:23.600]  One billion dollars
[02:14:23.600 --> 02:14:25.600]  Flooding, not just Facebook
[02:14:25.600 --> 02:14:27.600]  But YouTube everywhere
[02:14:27.600 --> 02:14:29.600]  With his own scientifically created
[02:14:29.600 --> 02:14:31.600]  Stuff to target
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:33.600]  Of the masses
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:35.600]  Facebook videos
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:37.600]  To try to dominate and basically jam everything
[02:14:37.600 --> 02:14:39.600]  So they now understand
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:41.600]  The future is going to be
[02:14:41.600 --> 02:14:43.600]  Factoid quick short videos
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:45.600]  Like yours, like Paul Watson's
[02:14:45.600 --> 02:14:47.600]  And so Google
[02:14:47.600 --> 02:14:49.600]  Google has also announced a program
[02:14:49.600 --> 02:14:51.600]  Where they're going to be paying
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:53.600]  For starting off
[02:14:53.600 --> 02:14:55.600]  1,000 journalists
[02:14:55.600 --> 02:14:57.600]  That they're going to have infiltrate
[02:14:57.600 --> 02:14:59.600]  Eight news agencies
[02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:01.600]  And Google is going to pay for them
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:03.600]  They're trying to market this as if this is like
[02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:05.600]  Them joining the
[02:15:05.600 --> 02:15:07.600]  You know the ROTC
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:09.600]  Or them joining the Peace Corps
[02:15:09.600 --> 02:15:11.600]  Like come and serve as a journalist
[02:15:11.600 --> 02:15:13.600]  And so Google is called
[02:15:13.600 --> 02:15:15.600]  Reporting for America
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:17.600]  And they're going to fund 25% of it
[02:15:17.600 --> 02:15:19.600]  And then they're going to pay for half of it
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:21.600]  And then they're going to crowd source
[02:15:21.600 --> 02:15:23.600]  The other 25%
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:25.600]  And let's be clear, let's be clear
[02:15:25.600 --> 02:15:27.600]  The Glenbecks have been filled in on this plan
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:29.600]  That's why he's totally Benedict Arnold
[02:15:29.600 --> 02:15:31.600]  Destroyed himself for this main audience
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:33.600]  Because he's been told we're going to shut down
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:35.600]  All the competition
[02:15:35.600 --> 02:15:37.600]  We're going to flood things with fake conservative
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:39.600]  Conservative void garbage
[02:15:39.600 --> 02:15:41.600]  But a bunch of liberal and establishment garbage
[02:15:41.600 --> 02:15:43.600]  So their answer is they're going to flood everything
[02:15:43.600 --> 02:15:45.600]  With content trying to drown us out
[02:15:45.600 --> 02:15:47.600]  While they censor us
[02:15:47.600 --> 02:15:49.600]  While they block us
[02:15:49.600 --> 02:15:51.600]  This is an epic battle
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:53.600]  So as you said, we may just have a few months
[02:15:53.600 --> 02:15:55.600]  Of anything being left
[02:15:55.600 --> 02:15:57.600]  YouTube also is paying
[02:15:57.600 --> 02:15:59.600]  And promoting and literally flying
[02:15:59.600 --> 02:16:01.600]  Talent out to their headquarters
[02:16:01.600 --> 02:16:03.600]  To the YouTube Space LA
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:05.600]  They've been doing this covertly for years
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:07.600]  Social justice warriors who they're promoting
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:09.600]  Who they're giving funds to
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:11.600]  Or they're literally turning over
[02:16:11.600 --> 02:16:13.600]  Their YouTube studios to
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.600]  Whole staff to help them produce
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.600]  Their content in order to
[02:16:17.600 --> 02:16:19.600]  Counter our message
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:21.600]  Here's what one of the people involved with
[02:16:21.600 --> 02:16:23.600]  Reporting for America had to say
[02:16:23.600 --> 02:16:25.600]  About Google's new plan to send
[02:16:25.600 --> 02:16:27.600]  Starting off a thousand journalists
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:29.600]  Again, which they're going to crowdsource
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:31.600]  Those will be fake news operatives
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:33.600]  That read talking points
[02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:35.600]  Just to add more faces to it
[02:16:35.600 --> 02:16:37.600]  That's their technique on CNN and MSNBC
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:39.600]  Is panels with seven to ten people
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:41.600]  All making it look like it's a consensus
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:43.600]  To create focus group TV programs
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:45.600]  To create false consensus
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:47.600]  They're trying to find what are called
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:49.600]  Social media influencers
[02:16:49.600 --> 02:16:51.600]  People who have a sizable social media following
[02:16:51.600 --> 02:16:53.600]  So that they can then post their articles
[02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:55.600]  And have them go viral
[02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:57.600]  Through their social media followings
[02:16:57.600 --> 02:16:59.600]  And so here's what one of the guys affiliated
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:01.600]  With it says, it says it's going to be a rigorous
[02:17:01.600 --> 02:17:03.600]  And probably a pretty tough
[02:17:03.600 --> 02:17:05.600]  Process to get in
[02:17:05.600 --> 02:17:07.600]  There are two selection processes
[02:17:07.600 --> 02:17:09.600]  One for would-be report for America
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:11.600]  The core members
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:13.600]  And another for news organizations
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:15.600]  That want to host them
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:17.600]  Sorry, Alex, if you want some of these people
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:19.600]  At infowars, you're going to have to apply
[02:17:19.600 --> 02:17:21.600]  And it's a rigorous process
[02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:23.600]  They always make it elitist
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:25.600]  Have biometrics on your Mercedes
[02:17:25.600 --> 02:17:27.600]  When it's an enslavement system
[02:17:27.600 --> 02:17:29.600]  We clamor to have Google give us money
[02:17:29.600 --> 02:17:31.600]  But really what you're getting is
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:33.600]  Google not blocking you
[02:17:33.600 --> 02:17:35.600]  And Google embedding
[02:17:35.600 --> 02:17:37.600]  I don't want to get into this
[02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:39.600]  I had Google six years ago reach out
[02:17:39.600 --> 02:17:41.600]  I had Facebook two years ago reach out
[02:17:41.600 --> 02:17:43.600]  And they just said, look, just stop
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:45.600]  And we'll fly to New York
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:47.600]  It was all just like out of a movie though
[02:17:47.600 --> 02:17:49.600]  Just be a little more friendly
[02:17:49.600 --> 02:17:51.600]  And we're not going to unblock you
[02:17:51.600 --> 02:17:53.600]  Or we're not going to block you
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:17:55.600]  And then suddenly my videos were all getting 2 million
[02:17:55.600 --> 02:17:57.600]  And then for like a month they go
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:17:59.600]  Oh, you're not being very friendly
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:01.600]  And it's right back down to 100,000
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:03.600]  And they weren't making me get the millions of views
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:05.600]  They were unblocking me and letting me have my own success
[02:18:05.600 --> 02:18:07.600]  So that's how this works
[02:18:07.600 --> 02:18:09.600]  Is they literally just influence
[02:18:09.600 --> 02:18:11.600]  Pedal
[02:18:11.600 --> 02:18:13.600]  They go on to say here
[02:18:13.600 --> 02:18:15.600]  Well, the reporters will need to persuade us
[02:18:15.600 --> 02:18:17.600]  That they have both the skills
[02:18:17.600 --> 02:18:19.600]  And the character
[02:18:19.600 --> 02:18:21.600]  Commitment to public service
[02:18:21.600 --> 02:18:23.600]  They're doing a public service now
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:25.600]  To have an impact quality
[02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:27.600]  What they're moving to is
[02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:29.600]  Not YouTube, but YouTube and Facebook
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:31.600]  All have their own people
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:33.600]  Everybody else is kicked off
[02:18:33.600 --> 02:18:35.600]  That's what they're doing
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:37.600]  The service of the SJW can be on
[02:18:37.600 --> 02:18:39.600]  Those are the ones that are going to be promoted obviously
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:41.600]  Because a lot of people don't know this
[02:18:41.600 --> 02:18:43.600]  But people who have Facebook fan pages
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:45.600]  Which is what all public figures have
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:47.600]  Or any band
[02:18:47.600 --> 02:18:49.600]  Or any brand on Facebook
[02:18:49.600 --> 02:18:51.600]  They limit the distribution unless you actually pay them
[02:18:51.600 --> 02:18:53.600]  To publish and distribute your posts
[02:18:53.600 --> 02:18:55.600]  And I think it's
[02:18:55.600 --> 02:18:57.600]  To reach everyone that subscribes to my page
[02:18:57.600 --> 02:18:59.600]  I think it's about $5,000
[02:18:59.600 --> 02:19:01.600]  For one single post
[02:19:01.600 --> 02:19:03.600]  They don't want our information to be seen
[02:19:03.600 --> 02:19:05.600]  So it's going to be this handheld
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:07.600]  Small group of social justice
[02:19:07.600 --> 02:19:09.600]  Where you're chosen people to be promoted
[02:19:09.600 --> 02:19:11.600]  This is what they're trying to do
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:13.600]  To control the information
[02:19:13.600 --> 02:19:15.600]  To control the narrative again
[02:19:15.600 --> 02:19:17.600]  Because they've absolutely lost it
[02:19:17.600 --> 02:19:19.600]  I see reports in mainstream media complaining
[02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:21.600]  About you and Paul Joseph Watson
[02:19:21.600 --> 02:19:23.600]  And other people on social media
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:25.600]  Almost every day now
[02:19:25.600 --> 02:19:27.600]  They just don't even know what to do
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:29.600]  At some point
[02:19:29.600 --> 02:19:31.600]  Of course they're going for some of the more
[02:19:31.600 --> 02:19:33.600]  Extremist racist people
[02:19:33.600 --> 02:19:35.600]  And shutting their accounts down
[02:19:35.600 --> 02:19:37.600]  And then they're just going to keep coming down
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.600]  And say well Paul Joseph Watson
[02:19:39.600 --> 02:19:41.600]  Your anti-immigration videos
[02:19:41.600 --> 02:19:43.600]  Pretty racist
[02:19:43.600 --> 02:19:45.600]  They've already demonetized all his videos
[02:19:45.600 --> 02:19:47.600]  And are now
[02:19:47.600 --> 02:19:49.600]  They deleted hundreds of his videos just last year
[02:19:49.600 --> 02:19:59.600]  37 million a piece
[02:20:19.600 --> 02:20:22.600]  Fullycookedbacon.com

[02:21:39.600 --> 02:21:41.600]  Pays after you're dead, that's true
[02:21:41.600 --> 02:21:43.600]  But you can have tax free access

[02:24:07.600 --> 02:24:10.600]  Mark Dice of markdice.com is here with us.
[02:24:10.600 --> 02:24:12.600]  I'm going to be carrying his new bestselling book.
[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:13.600]  We know it's going to be bestselling.
[02:24:13.600 --> 02:24:18.600]  Many of his books have been bestsellers at m4store.com as soon as that sucker comes out in about three months.
[02:24:18.600 --> 02:24:19.600]  I know some of the subjects.
[02:24:19.600 --> 02:24:20.600]  It's his biggest book.
[02:24:20.600 --> 02:24:24.600]  Can't wait to see that, especially now that his audience is so huge.
[02:24:24.600 --> 02:24:28.600]  That makes me sleep better at night, folks, knowing that Paul Watson's huge and he's huge.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:32.600]  There's a lot of other big people now because it's scary to be the one guy that's big.
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:34.600]  But getting back to Mark Dice.
[02:24:34.600 --> 02:24:40.600]  I watched him drinking coffee during the break and it was the Jay Leno show back when he was hosting.
[02:24:40.600 --> 02:24:45.600]  Jay Leno, I know for a fact, would have kept the show.
[02:24:45.600 --> 02:24:46.600]  He had higher ratings.
[02:24:46.600 --> 02:24:47.600]  The ratings dropped massively.
[02:24:47.600 --> 02:24:50.600]  He would not just attack conservatives every night.
[02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:51.600]  He's not even a conservative.
[02:24:51.600 --> 02:24:52.600]  He's more like a libertarian.
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:53.600]  I know people that know him well.
[02:24:53.600 --> 02:24:54.600]  He's a listener of the show.
[02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:55.600]  He's a patriot.
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:58.600]  And Jay Leno would not play ball.
[02:24:58.600 --> 02:24:59.600]  And so he's gone.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:02.600]  That's why they have these complete hacks now.
[02:25:02.600 --> 02:25:03.600]  And it's weird.
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:07.600]  There's this paradox where they've got all these HBO shows, showtime shows.
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.600]  I won't talk about myself, but I have to.
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:14.600]  They have all these programs where they have comedy central shows where the person says they're me,
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:18.600]  says racist things, and then I don't get to respond because they go,
[02:25:18.600 --> 02:25:25.600]  oh, it's just comedy while they censor me in the real world and try to shut me up, Mark Dice.
[02:25:25.600 --> 02:25:29.600]  You know, Leno was pushed out when he was number one for over 20 years.
[02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:31.600]  It doesn't make any sense in terms of the television business.
[02:25:31.600 --> 02:25:34.600]  You don't push somebody out when they are number one, when they've been number one,
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:35.600]  and there's no indication.
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:37.600]  I mean, I know people that know him.
[02:25:37.600 --> 02:25:39.600]  I mean, he's even kind of said it.
[02:25:39.600 --> 02:25:42.600]  He said he's not going to sit there and divide American be a big jerk.
[02:25:42.600 --> 02:25:47.600]  Well, he was the first late night comedian to pull the gloves off and start going after Obama.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:49.600]  And if you recall, I mean, everybody was really soft.
[02:25:49.600 --> 02:25:52.600]  People that jokes about Obama, they were very light.
[02:25:52.600 --> 02:25:54.600]  They weren't even, you know, jabs at him.
[02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:58.600]  They were just sort of jokes about him, the administration, all to make him look like a good guy.
[02:25:58.600 --> 02:26:01.600]  And then after, I don't remember exactly what point it was,
[02:26:01.600 --> 02:26:06.600]  but after the hope and change started wearing off and turned into, you know, regret and despair,
[02:26:06.600 --> 02:26:07.600]  Leno took the gloves off.
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:13.600]  And I remember because I was a big Leno fan when he started making very, very serious jokes about him.
[02:26:13.600 --> 02:26:15.600]  He started tearing Obama up and they fired him.
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:16.600]  They got rid of him.
[02:26:16.600 --> 02:26:19.600]  And, you know, the comedians are propagandists.
[02:26:19.600 --> 02:26:24.600]  I mean, I think it was Time Magazine or Newsweek even dubbed what they're calling the John Oliver Effect
[02:26:24.600 --> 02:26:30.600]  in that John Oliver's audience is a politically active group and that John Oliver uses his platform,
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:33.600]  obviously not just as comedy, which I guess you could call it comedy to some,
[02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:36.600]  but as a political activist organization.
[02:26:36.600 --> 02:26:43.600]  And so they actually are calling his, you know, political agenda the John Oliver Effect
[02:26:43.600 --> 02:26:48.600]  because he's having such a powerful effect on various legislation and on our culture.
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:50.600]  That's why this is a culture war.
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.600]  You know, that's why I'm excited in a couple of months, you know, to promote the new book.
[02:26:54.600 --> 02:26:55.600]  It's going to be so good.
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:01.600]  And that's why I'm so glad to see Inforwards grow from such a, you know, from a basic operation to what it is now
[02:27:01.600 --> 02:27:05.600]  because it's so crucial that we counter this propaganda that they're putting out on a daily basis.
[02:27:05.600 --> 02:27:08.600]  I don't know what they're going to do because they're losing so many viewers.
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:10.600]  Nobody's watching the NFL anymore.
[02:27:10.600 --> 02:27:11.600]  Nobody's watching these awards.
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:14.600]  I was about to say the NFL has record low viewers.
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.600]  All of them are imploding because we're sick of being beat over the head with SJW.
[02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:22.600]  Where do you in your gut see all this ending?
[02:27:22.600 --> 02:27:27.600]  You know, I think it's just going to turn into more of a Huxley and circus where I think they're going to just start
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:34.600]  basically bribing people with lottery type winnings to watch shows sort of like you do on your local radio shows.
[02:27:34.600 --> 02:27:38.600]  You know, all the 10th caller gets free tickets to, you know, go to such and such a concert.
[02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:43.600]  I think they're going to just start offering people money or they're going to have to offer people chances to come
[02:27:43.600 --> 02:27:45.600]  and hang out with your favorite celebrity.
[02:27:45.600 --> 02:27:47.600]  Oh, come and hang out with Jimmy Kimmel.
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:50.600]  Just watch the show and, you know, text in and you're going to be chosen.
[02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:53.600]  I'm not sure what they're going to do because their audiences have dwindled.
[02:27:53.600 --> 02:27:59.600]  They made a slight comeback in the liberal cable news channels since the election.
[02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:04.600]  Before the election season, back in like 2014, they could barely get 150,000 viewers.
[02:28:04.600 --> 02:28:07.600]  Sure, and that dead cat bounce is now wearing off.
[02:28:07.600 --> 02:28:14.600]  But they also have this UN phenomenon where the globalists control all the money and then have these big robot factories where they're going to, quote,
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:17.600]  give everybody free money, a basic monthly income.
[02:28:17.600 --> 02:28:25.600]  But to do that, you've got to sign on to the government's SJW agenda, just like, oh, you'll have a YouTube site and we'll pay you now.
[02:28:25.600 --> 02:28:28.600]  We're demonetizing everybody else for real success.
[02:28:28.600 --> 02:28:33.600]  No one gets money unless you prescribe to our code of ethics.
[02:28:33.600 --> 02:28:40.600]  Yeah, they'll start banning people just like they, Patreon, a sort of an alternative funding mechanism for content creators,
[02:28:40.600 --> 02:28:46.600]  the YouTubers banned Lauren Southern or just a conservative YouTuber because they just didn't like what she was doing.
[02:28:46.600 --> 02:28:49.600]  They violated their terms of service.
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:52.600]  That's why relying on this technology is quite dangerous.
[02:28:52.600 --> 02:28:54.600]  It is the best of times. It is the worst of times.
[02:28:54.600 --> 02:28:57.600]  Double-edged sword because it's amazing what we're able to do.
[02:28:57.600 --> 02:29:01.600]  But at the same time, at any point, they can completely cut us off, shut us off.
[02:29:01.600 --> 02:29:09.600]  Well, let's go further. Clearly, they say that they're this combine, they're this utility so everybody can be there,
[02:29:09.600 --> 02:29:11.600]  but then they discriminate against us.
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:22.600]  But now banning GAB, kicking them off Google platforms for apps, foreign governments kicking them off just because they're a truly open place for people to talk.
[02:29:22.600 --> 02:29:30.600]  I mean, it's next level with Google and Facebook and Twitter, Mark, as you know, supporting government platforms, supporting Saudi Arabia and Iran,
[02:29:30.600 --> 02:29:35.600]  giving them the intel at Twitter on blasphemers of Islam to kill them.
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:41.600]  It shows they're ready to climb in bed with any authoritarianism as fast as they can jump in that dirty bed.
[02:29:41.600 --> 02:29:42.600]  We'll be back.
[02:29:42.600 --> 02:29:48.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.600 --> 02:29:58.600]  Police departments across the country are now using an invasive surveillance tool called Stingrays,
[02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:05.600]  which use cell phone towers to intercept phone calls and text messages without warrants.
[02:30:05.600 --> 02:30:13.600]  The technology comes courtesy of the FBI who have forced our nation's police departments into signing nondisclosure agreements,
[02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:20.600]  forbidding them from publicly talking about the technology.
[02:30:20.600 --> 02:30:28.600]  Needless to say, this is a direct violation of our Fourth Amendment and they have no legal authority for warrantless Stingray spying,
[02:30:28.600 --> 02:30:37.600]  where we now know that police are collecting information on thousands of innocent people who are not even suspected of any crimes.
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:42.600]  Once again, more evidence that the police state isn't coming. It's already here.
[02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:48.600]  I'm Aaron McBreen and I invite you to join the resistance. Infowars.com.
[02:31:12.600 --> 02:31:19.600]  Now developed, Alexa Pure Breeze. Whether it's your home or office, you owe it to yourself, your coworkers, your family, your children,
[02:31:19.600 --> 02:31:24.600]  to the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[02:31:24.600 --> 02:31:32.600]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most toxic effects themselves. The general public doesn't.
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:39.600]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500. One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[02:31:39.600 --> 02:31:46.600]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[02:31:46.600 --> 02:31:52.600]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:31:52.600 --> 02:31:57.600]  As most of you already know, I am a voracious consumer of news and information.
[02:31:57.600 --> 02:32:04.600]  And in the last four or five years doing more and more research, I came across the fact that the elite establishment
[02:32:04.600 --> 02:32:11.600]  is fully aware of the fact that our ancient ancestors, in many cases, had much better nutrition than we do today.
[02:32:11.600 --> 02:32:17.600]  And our ancient ancestors sought out the bones of the animals that they were hunting, killing, and then processing.
[02:32:17.600 --> 02:32:23.600]  And so I set out to develop Caveman, but to not just have concentrated bone broth from chicken,
[02:32:23.600 --> 02:32:31.600]  but seven other superfood ingredients known for cleansing and supercharging the body at the same time.
[02:32:31.600 --> 02:32:35.600]  Infowars isn't just fighting the globalist. We're getting results.
[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:41.600]  And we're expanding in the face of the complete media assault and winning because of your support.
[02:32:41.600 --> 02:32:44.600]  Caveman is back in stock. People absolutely love it.
[02:32:44.600 --> 02:33:03.600]  So please secure your Caveman today at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-free, CRIPLE-A2533139.
[02:33:03.600 --> 02:33:17.600]  From the Infowars.com studios in the recaptured state of Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:17.600 --> 02:33:23.600]  For the unknown soldier, Mark Dice has taken over for five minutes to the next hour.
[02:33:23.600 --> 02:33:26.600]  Then John Rubberport's going to be hosting full fourth hour.
[02:33:26.600 --> 02:33:30.600]  Before I go any further, I had one of their clips I wanted to play for Mark Dice,
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:33.600]  we were just talking during the break about how crazy this is.
[02:33:33.600 --> 02:33:38.600]  And I remember back when Kim Dotcom was in the news and he was saying,
[02:33:38.600 --> 02:33:41.600]  oh, Hillary's Christmas presents are coming. Oh, it's over for you.
[02:33:41.600 --> 02:33:43.600]  Assange is going to release the motherload.
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:45.600]  And then I was talking to all these journalists.
[02:33:45.600 --> 02:33:51.600]  I mean, Assange was doing London Guardian interviews, Fox News interviews, New York Times interviews back then.
[02:33:51.600 --> 02:33:56.600]  And then they acted like Roger Stone trying to talk to him was proof that he was a Russian agent,
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:01.600]  as if there's proof that Assange is. It was just so many degrees of baloney.
[02:34:01.600 --> 02:34:04.600]  And I remember talking to, I'm not going to name the reporters,
[02:34:04.600 --> 02:34:09.600]  but talking to Stone at the RNC and even other events before that.
[02:34:09.600 --> 02:34:12.600]  And going, hey, let me meet with this New York Times reporter.
[02:34:12.600 --> 02:34:15.600]  She talked to Assange today and he was obsessed with Assange.
[02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:18.600]  Hey, I'm trying to, a Guardian reporter that I know is going to be going in next week.
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:22.600]  And maybe he's going to get my question into her. I mean, into him.
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:29.600]  That's the, that's the Russia investigation on Roger Stone that he tried to talk to Julian Assange.
[02:34:29.600 --> 02:34:34.600]  Everybody was. I mean, we sent him probably 50 emails asking him to come on.
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:38.600]  Does that mean I'm a Russian agent? How come the New York Times could interview Julian Assange?
[02:34:38.600 --> 02:34:42.600]  But if I try to, Mark Dice, I'm a Russian agent.
[02:34:42.600 --> 02:34:45.600]  Yeah, I think this is one of their final steps in trying to shut us down.
[02:34:45.600 --> 02:34:49.600]  At first, they accused us of being all a bunch of alt-right white supremacists.
[02:34:49.600 --> 02:34:56.600]  That totally didn't work, backfired. I got several reports to issue retractions after they defamed me, accusing me of that.
[02:34:56.600 --> 02:34:59.600]  Then they call us all a bunch of Russian agents. Doesn't really work.
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:03.600]  Then they try to demonetize our channels. We're still going.
[02:35:03.600 --> 02:35:06.600]  Then they try to just get us shut down for terms of service violations.
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:10.600]  Now we're seeing other alternative, decentralized systems popping up.
[02:35:10.600 --> 02:35:14.600]  The Streisand effect is working. It's just bringing more attention to our cause.
[02:35:14.600 --> 02:35:22.600]  Then they go for really one step beyond just assassinations. That is to try to just sue people or get them to be investigated criminally,
[02:35:22.600 --> 02:35:28.600]  which could be $50,000 a month just to defend a basic lawsuit.
[02:35:28.600 --> 02:35:32.600]  Just to get a lawsuit thrown out. It could be $5,000. It's just outrageous.
[02:35:32.600 --> 02:35:35.600]  They know that they can bankrupt people.
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:41.600]  I just read a report that Roger Stone had accumulated half a million dollars in legal fees or is expecting to.
[02:35:41.600 --> 02:35:47.600]  It looks like this is one of their most vicious and desperate attacks that try to shut us down.
[02:35:47.600 --> 02:35:51.600]  It's quite outrageous. Call us names all you want to, even if it's defamatory.
[02:35:51.600 --> 02:35:56.600]  It doesn't really have that big of a damage against us because our audience knows the truth.
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:36:04.600]  We can have a platform to respond, but not everybody can respond or could afford $10,000 a month in lawsuits.
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:11.600]  We're in really critical times right now. Quite a scary time. Quite exciting to see what's happening now,
[02:36:11.600 --> 02:36:40.600]  but it's definitely not time to fall asleep at the wheel.
[02:36:40.600 --> 02:36:44.600]  I don't understand. Don't they get now that they admit they want to ban us?
[02:36:44.600 --> 02:36:50.600]  And then Hillary has attacked me seven times in her book. She attacked me again last week.
[02:36:50.600 --> 02:36:55.600]  Don't they understand that when they call us dark heart and evil, that people know she's evil?
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:03.600]  So even folks that didn't know who I was, they're coming to newswars.com, infowars.com to find out what all the hubbub is.
[02:37:03.600 --> 02:37:09.600]  When I heard Hillary Clinton call you out by name during a speech, my jaw just dropped because it was a tremendous gift that she gave you.
[02:37:09.600 --> 02:37:15.600]  And I knew that you were going to put that clip into your bumpers because it's hilarious. It's really an honor.
[02:37:15.600 --> 02:37:19.600]  You know, sometimes they say that you could judge a man based off the size of their enemies.
[02:37:19.600 --> 02:37:24.600]  And you can't have much of a more sinister, well-connected enemy than Hillary Clinton.
[02:37:24.600 --> 02:37:30.600]  But I think they really do have a mass mental illness. They don't even know what to do because the fact that she's out with her new book is just ridiculous.
[02:37:30.600 --> 02:37:33.600]  I mean, most of the people, even in the little media, are crazy.
[02:37:33.600 --> 02:37:41.600]  It shows how crazy, exactly, even her own liberals go, you sound like a walked out nut and you're blaming everybody but yourself.
[02:37:41.600 --> 02:37:48.600]  Yeah, she everybody but herself. I mean, from WikiLeaks to the Russians to you to fake news to Facebook, it's ridiculous.
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:51.600]  And you even have people who really like her, but they're trying to be nice to her.
[02:37:51.600 --> 02:37:55.600]  I mean, she was on Stephen Colbert's show the other day. I just saw a clip online and he even said...
[02:37:55.600 --> 02:37:58.600]  They're like toasting champagne?
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:03.600]  He even said to her though, he said, a lot of people are, you know, asking, you know, why don't you just go away?
[02:38:03.600 --> 02:38:07.600]  And you can see her facial expressions during her interviews are just bizarre.
[02:38:07.600 --> 02:38:14.600]  I mean, she looks just totally whacked out of her mind. She looks like she needs to be sedated, or she probably is sedated.
[02:38:14.600 --> 02:38:22.600]  Well, by the way, I was told by our sources, and that's why I have Chardonnay up there as a joke, that she was falling down drunk election night throwing things at people.
[02:38:22.600 --> 02:38:27.600]  And I got that from the Secret Service, just like they told us she was collapsing every 45 minutes and a month later was caught on tape.
[02:38:27.600 --> 02:38:29.600]  And these are real sources.
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:32.600]  She was expecting to win. So she didn't have a concession speech written.
[02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:39.600]  That's why they had to wait until the very next day to come out and admit defeat, because it's breaking tradition.
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:42.600]  Everybody has a concession speech written because you just don't know what's going to happen.
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:47.600]  It's part of the plan. When you're one of the top two contenders, you plan for anything to happen.
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:49.600]  They didn't even have a concession speech.
[02:38:49.600 --> 02:38:54.600]  And then they make a joke about how she's a total alcoholic that physically attacks her staff.
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:38:59.600]  I've been reading that and talking to FBI eyewitnesses that were in the White House 20 something years ago.
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:02.600]  She was throwing ashtrays at people and beating men up.
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:05.600]  I mean, she is a vicious demon.
[02:39:05.600 --> 02:39:07.600]  Her soul is definitely twisted.
[02:39:07.600 --> 02:39:14.600]  I mean, this is, you would just look at her face, and this is the kind of torment that someone is experiencing when they lose a spouse,
[02:39:14.600 --> 02:39:19.600]  or when they come down with a serious illness that's going to get them in a few months.
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:26.600]  I think that part of this is a strategy from them to try to portray her as being strong,
[02:39:26.600 --> 02:39:31.600]  to try to pretend like if she doesn't, she's not going to go away, because if she just disappeared,
[02:39:31.600 --> 02:39:34.600]  it may look as if she's weak, as if she gave up.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:39.600]  So I think part of the strategy with her new book is to come out and pretend like she's strong.
[02:39:39.600 --> 02:39:44.600]  She can take it to keep this hype going about this Russia conspiracy.
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:49.600]  And, you know, we talked earlier about, you were talking earlier in the show about the wiretaps,
[02:39:49.600 --> 02:39:54.600]  and now it's totally bendy bunk that, well, they have wiretaps metaphor.
[02:39:54.600 --> 02:39:56.600]  I'm in the wiretaps.
[02:39:56.600 --> 02:39:59.600]  Law enforcement was so upset they gave me the secret wiretaps,
[02:39:59.600 --> 02:40:02.600]  and let me tell you, it's my private number, it's Trump's private numbers, it's real.
[02:40:02.600 --> 02:40:05.600]  Notice the media never touched that either, Mark.
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:12.600]  Let's not forget that the CIA admitted that they actually hacked into the Senate Intelligence Committee's computers
[02:40:12.600 --> 02:40:18.600]  when the Senate Intelligence Committee was investigating the torture and interrogation,
[02:40:18.600 --> 02:40:22.600]  the enhanced interrogation techniques during the Bush administration.
[02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:24.600]  And so they fully admit this.
[02:40:24.600 --> 02:40:29.600]  The Senate Intelligence Committee is the group of congressmen who are given classified material
[02:40:29.600 --> 02:40:38.600]  and have a high-level authority to monitor the CIA to make sure that they're not doing anything illegal.
[02:40:38.600 --> 02:40:43.600]  And the CIA was spying on them to see what they knew,
[02:40:43.600 --> 02:40:48.600]  just like they did to Cheryl Atkinson, former ABC reporter, CBS reporter,
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:54.600]  when they admit the CIA was hacking into her computer, CBS admits this,
[02:40:54.600 --> 02:40:58.600]  when she was investigating Benghazi, because they wanted to know her sources.
[02:40:58.600 --> 02:41:02.600]  They wanted to know what she knew, who she was talking to.
[02:41:02.600 --> 02:41:07.600]  I mean, this is third-world-level dictatorship tactics.
[02:41:07.600 --> 02:41:12.600]  Oh, I can't tell you how many times it comes out in the newspaper that some guest I've had on
[02:41:12.600 --> 02:41:18.600]  had their computer hacked into and ours for the CIA, and then it's given the FBI,
[02:41:18.600 --> 02:41:22.600]  and then there they are in federal court using it against somebody in a federal court,
[02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:25.600]  and I've been spied on and I learned no warrant.
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:28.600]  They even use this stuff in court with no warrants.
[02:41:28.600 --> 02:41:31.600]  And then they go on the news and act like, oh, it's not happening.
[02:41:31.600 --> 02:41:36.600]  I mean, I've been sitting there before, because the CIA, different groups of it, call me up and stuff.
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:39.600]  I'm not going to get into it on air. It's just a total wreck.
[02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:44.600]  And the thing is, I don't want to kiss the CIA's butt, but there are a lot of patriots even in the CIA,
[02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:49.600]  but it's the globalists, it's the socialists that infest, the schools, the corporations, the deep state.
[02:41:49.600 --> 02:41:53.600]  There's a civil war there. Mark Dice is taking over here in one minute.

[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:14.600]  deleting his channel twice if his memory serves.
[02:42:14.600 --> 02:42:16.600]  I'll ask him in a minute, but briefly.
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:21.600]  50% off the highest quality, storable foods out there fresh the last 25 years,
[02:42:21.600 --> 02:42:26.600]  vacuum sealed in the big plastic tow containers from my patriot, promo code ready at checkout.

[02:42:28.600 --> 02:42:33.600]  I'm extending it because the Mexico earthquake and all the rest of the crises, they've authorized me to do this.
[02:42:33.600 --> 02:42:36.600]  I was going to end it this weekend, but they said, no, you can keep going,
[02:42:36.600 --> 02:42:39.600]  but they don't want to slow down their production. They ship within days of your order.
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:42.600]  So they start slowing things down because the orders are so high.
[02:42:42.600 --> 02:42:45.600]  This sale will end in the next few days. It may go for another week.
[02:42:45.600 --> 02:42:51.600]  A week maximum info or store.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[02:42:51.600 --> 02:42:57.600]  All of the fluoride free, super blue, mouth care products, the toothpaste, the mouthwash.
[02:42:57.600 --> 02:43:00.600]  That's all on sale. We've never done this before 50% off.
[02:43:00.600 --> 02:43:04.600]  That is going to end as soon as I get some new specials together because we're selling out of it.
[02:43:04.600 --> 02:43:09.600]  So I've got to, I want to stop it and have it at full price a while before more comes in in a month.
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:11.600]  We want to fund our operation because we sell more.
[02:43:11.600 --> 02:43:15.600]  We do these big discounts, but we sell a lot more to fund ourselves.
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:16.600]  So thank you all for the support.
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:21.600]  Now back to the one, the only media critic, author and researcher, Mark Dice.
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:23.600]  He'll host five minutes the next hour.
[02:43:23.600 --> 02:43:29.600]  And then John Rappaport, exposing fake news is coming up straight ahead.
[02:43:29.600 --> 02:43:33.600]  Now let's go right back to Mark Dice.
[02:43:33.600 --> 02:43:38.600]  You know, we're, we're talking about the wiretaps with Paul Manafort in Trump Tower and they're saying Trump will may have been,
[02:43:38.600 --> 02:43:40.600]  you know, collected on those wiretaps.
[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:43.600]  There actually haven't just specifically wiretapped him.
[02:43:43.600 --> 02:43:49.600]  I mean, Edward Snowden back four years ago when he released his treasure trove of NSA documents in 2013,
[02:43:49.600 --> 02:43:53.600]  revealed a program called Project Mystic.
[02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:54.600]  And again, this is four years old.
[02:43:54.600 --> 02:43:57.600]  Who knows how old those documents were at the time that he even obtained them.
[02:43:57.600 --> 02:44:05.600]  Where the NSA was recording every phone call in an entire country on a 30 day buffer.
[02:44:05.600 --> 02:44:06.600]  Okay.
[02:44:06.600 --> 02:44:12.600]  So they literally have a program and again with, with the advances in technology in four years,
[02:44:12.600 --> 02:44:17.600]  this is most likely an entire, the entire globe's conversations.
[02:44:17.600 --> 02:44:20.600]  On a 30 day buffer four years ago.
[02:44:20.600 --> 02:44:27.600]  So every single phone call that was made in an entire country, audio recorded, transcribed,
[02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:32.600]  then put into a text file most likely so it can be searchable like Google.
[02:44:32.600 --> 02:44:37.600]  So it's not even just someone that is targeted specifically for a wiretap.
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:46.600]  They theoretically and most likely can go back and find any conversation from any person from the last several years.
[02:44:46.600 --> 02:44:54.600]  And then do a keyword search on it to find out specifically who is talking to who and what was said at any given time.
[02:44:54.600 --> 02:44:56.600]  That's how scary this is.
[02:44:56.600 --> 02:44:58.600]  That's the Orwellian nightmare.
[02:44:58.600 --> 02:45:01.600]  This is what Edward Snowden tried to talk about.
[02:45:01.600 --> 02:45:06.600]  And it's, it's important to really bring home that the fake news industry, the mainstream media,
[02:45:06.600 --> 02:45:11.600]  they've been manipulated by the establishment by the deep state for decades.
[02:45:11.600 --> 02:45:19.600]  In the 1970s, there was a congressional hearing which was investigating the CIA doing assassinations and all sorts of other illegal activities.
[02:45:19.600 --> 02:45:27.600]  And then inadvertently uncovered Operation Mockingbird, which was the program to pay the mainstream media under the table
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:31.600]  to act as gatekeepers and propagandists for the establishment.
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:46.600]  50 at least CIA agents or journalists, editors, CEOs were in this program, half of which the Congressional Committee admits were paid by the CIA.
[02:45:46.600 --> 02:45:51.600]  One of the people involved with Operation Mockingbird, there's a couple different names that we call it.
[02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:53.600]  That's, that's one of the biggest names.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:46:01.600]  Another one is he called it the Mighty Whirlitzer because the Whirlitzer was a jukebox back in the 1950s.
[02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:04.600]  A jukebox, obviously many of you are familiar with them in bars or restaurants.
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:08.600]  They can play, you know, within reason almost any, any song that you want.
[02:46:08.600 --> 02:46:17.600]  And so they called it the Mighty Whirlitzer because the CIA could get the media to play any tune that they wanted.
[02:46:17.600 --> 02:46:23.600]  And so it's important to bring these, you know, historical examples of fake news and the names of these programs.
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:30.600]  Operation Mockingbird, the Mighty Whirlitzer, back into the consciousness of everyone because we're in this, you know, information war,
[02:46:30.600 --> 02:46:38.600]  as Alex's sort of tagline has been for probably a decade at least on the InfoWars website.
[02:46:38.600 --> 02:46:41.600]  So it's so important. That's why they're trying to shut us down.
[02:46:41.600 --> 02:46:52.600]  I mean, at some point they'll probably have the web browsers, Firefox, Chrome, et cetera, just block InfoWars.com or other websites.
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:47:01.600]  And that's why some of these public, you know, some of these social media services really need to be regulated as if they are public utilities
[02:47:01.600 --> 02:47:14.600]  because Twitter or Facebook or an internet registrar shutting down a website or shutting down your account or even censoring a particular post or a video on YouTube
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:21.600]  would be the equivalent of the phone company listening to every conversation that you and your friends have
[02:47:21.600 --> 02:47:26.600]  and then canceling your service if they just didn't like what it was that you were saying.
[02:47:26.600 --> 02:47:35.600]  And this would be like the post office, if you were sending out your own magazine or a newsletter like people used to do back in the 1980s
[02:47:35.600 --> 02:47:44.600]  and the 1990s before the internet sort of took over that, it would be like the post office deciding not to deliver your magazine anymore
[02:47:44.600 --> 02:47:51.600]  because they just didn't like what it said. This is the level of censorship that we're at now.
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:48:00.600]  And this is why it's more important than ever to get involved, to keep spreading this information, instead of following websites through social media
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:08.600]  to just bookmark them directly and visit them directly, to sign up for the email lists so that you can get the newsletters that way.
[02:48:08.600 --> 02:48:16.600]  I mean, just imagine if, let's say the postal service again, we're to shut down specific magazines,
[02:48:16.600 --> 02:48:24.600]  but we just don't like what you're saying. That is exactly what these social media companies are doing when they're censoring people.
[02:48:24.600 --> 02:48:30.600]  So we've been documenting the fake news. Alex has been doing it for probably 15, 16 years.
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:35.600]  And so it's important to bring some previous examples to the forefront.
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:39.600]  Previous examples, most of the fake news, let's face it, comes from the mainstream media.
[02:48:39.600 --> 02:48:46.600]  I mean, they're the ones that have the major distribution channels. They're the ones who most people believe.
[02:48:46.600 --> 02:48:55.600]  And so we've seen fake news from major networks like NBC News blowing up a GM truck and setting lit flares underneath a car
[02:48:55.600 --> 02:49:02.600]  and ramming it into it back in the 1990s during an investigation into faulty gas tanks from General Motors trucks.
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:10.600]  They were sued by GM and had to admit that they staged the explosion. They put a fake gas cap on the gas tank,
[02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:17.600]  put lit flares underneath the car, rammed it into a truck, and then gas spilled out of the gas tank and exploded.
[02:49:17.600 --> 02:49:23.600]  And they were, again, trying to investigate a real concern about faulty gas tanks on certain model GM trucks,
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:29.600]  but they staged an explosion and it went viral. Everybody's sort of freaking out about this dangerous gas tank.
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:38.600]  Well, GM sued, found the vehicles that were in the junkyard, had them analyzed forensically and determined that,
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:45.600]  and then NBC News later admitted, that they staged the whole thing. This is on a supposed news channel.
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:54.600]  I mean, many of you may recall a hilarious kind of example on, I think it was NBC, another NBC, or maybe this was ABC,
[02:49:54.600 --> 02:50:00.600]  during a flood, and they went to a live shot and they showed a reporter in a canoe,
[02:50:00.600 --> 02:50:04.600]  and it looked like there was six, seven feet of water in the middle of a suburb,
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:08.600]  and then a couple of guys came walking along and the water was ankle deep.
[02:50:08.600 --> 02:50:14.600]  Okay, this is fake news. Fake news is when Newsweek, big trusted publication,
[02:50:14.600 --> 02:50:26.600]  puts out a story about American soldiers flushing karans down the toilet in attempts to taunt detainees at Camp X-ray,
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:32.600]  and then it causes riots and deaths in multiple Middle Eastern countries based off of fake news stories.
[02:50:32.600 --> 02:50:52.600]  We'll be back after the break. I'm Mark Dice, sitting in for Alex Jones.
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:51:02.600]  With nearly 70 years of history engineering bunkers, today Atlas Survival Shelters is still the authority.

[02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:17.600]  Closing to fake news machine. Fake news, obviously, as we covered last segment, dates back decades.
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:21.600]  But in the last, really year, last several months, they've ramped up their operation.
[02:54:21.600 --> 02:54:25.600]  Trying to shut down the real news. Trying to shut down networks like this.
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:31.600]  When we have ABC News, which was sued for a hundred, actually they were sued for billions of dollars,
[02:54:31.600 --> 02:54:37.600]  but they settled for, I think it was $175 million for putting out a series of fake news stories
[02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:45.600]  that helped to almost bankrupt the entire industry. Many of you may recall the pink slime scare.
[02:54:45.600 --> 02:54:54.600]  That was about a meat producing plant. They showed some of the food processing before it reaches the grocery store.
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:58.600]  It looked a little bit strange and they coined this term pink slime.
[02:54:58.600 --> 02:55:04.600]  It scared so many people away from buying beef from this company that it almost bankrupted them.
[02:55:04.600 --> 02:55:14.600]  They sued for several billion dollars. ABC settled for what was the equivalent of an entire year of their profits
[02:55:14.600 --> 02:55:17.600]  because of fake news from ABC.
[02:55:17.600 --> 02:55:24.600]  CBS, the flagship station of 60 Minutes, the hard hitting investigation show.
[02:55:24.600 --> 02:55:28.600]  Many of you may recall a few months ago they did a segment about fake news.
[02:55:28.600 --> 02:55:34.600]  The examples that they used of fake news websites weren't even fake news.
[02:55:34.600 --> 02:55:39.600]  They were parody websites, satire websites like The Onion.
[02:55:39.600 --> 02:55:45.600]  Nobody in their right mind would read any of the examples or most of the examples that they showed
[02:55:45.600 --> 02:55:48.600]  and think, oh, that's fake news.
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:54.600]  They're literally a parody of real news showing parodies as fake news.
[02:55:54.600 --> 02:56:04.600]  One of the stories was a headline about how Donald Trump, after having a colonoscopy, had a brain tumor discovered.
[02:56:04.600 --> 02:56:10.600]  Well, get the joke, you know, they're looking in his rear end and they thought where his brain is up his butt
[02:56:10.600 --> 02:56:18.600]  and they find a brain tumor. That's an example that CBS used on 60 Minutes as fake news.
[02:56:18.600 --> 02:56:26.600]  Meanwhile, the parody Twitter account of the administrative arm of North Korea
[02:56:26.600 --> 02:56:33.600]  has duped countless mainstream publications from USA Today and Ray of other ones
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:43.600]  into reporting fake news because they can't tell that it's a parody Twitter account from North Korea's government.
[02:56:43.600 --> 02:56:51.600]  Just for years now, this fake DPRK account just tweets out ridiculous statements
[02:56:51.600 --> 02:56:57.600]  as if they're coming from North Korea that anybody should be able to tell is a parody
[02:56:57.600 --> 02:57:00.600]  and publications keep reporting it as if it's real news.
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:07.600]  We saw a parody Twitter account of Michael Flynn, again, that wasn't verified, had no followers,
[02:57:07.600 --> 02:57:13.600]  being quoted by Nancy Pelosi as evidence of the Russia conspiracy.
[02:57:13.600 --> 02:57:20.600]  After he was forced out, the fake Michael Flynn Twitter account tweeted out that this is a big,
[02:57:20.600 --> 02:57:27.600]  because I'm a patsy, he said. And so Nancy Pelosi quoted that at a press conference
[02:57:27.600 --> 02:57:34.600]  and then Dan Rather posted a big diatribe on his Facebook page about how this is bigger than Watergate.
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:39.600]  Dan Rather, of course, was really forced out of CBS News after their fake news
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:58:05.600]  during the Bush administration about fake documents that they said.
