[00:00.000 --> 00:05.000]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCM radio.
[00:10.000 --> 00:17.000]  My friends, do you know one of the key hallmarks of a hardcore police state, whether it was Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany?
[00:19.000 --> 00:23.000]  Governments would take political dissidents, passports away.
[00:23.000 --> 00:29.000]  In the United States, that's only done if you've been charged with espionage, or if you're out on bail for a serious crime.
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  The IRS has written a law that's passed the Senate and is now in the house, and Forbes and other publications are reporting on it like it's no big deal.
[00:39.000 --> 00:46.000]  Hey, if the IRS says you owe back taxes, you're not going to be allowed to travel outside the country that are going to take your passport.
[00:48.000 --> 00:50.000]  How many times have I told you this was coming?
[00:50.000 --> 00:58.000]  This is exactly what the IMF and World Bank, the consortium for the international arm of the Private Fellow Reserve, have called for for more than 15 years.
[00:59.000 --> 01:05.000]  A global, cashless society. Already many jobs, you've got to get TSA approval and authorization to have them.
[01:06.000 --> 01:15.000]  I saw Homeland Security nine years ago on C-SPAN say, you're not going to get on a plane if you haven't paid your taxes, you're not going to get a driver's license, you're not going to be allowed to work.
[01:15.000 --> 01:22.000]  This is total enslavement. This is beyond anything we've seen in history.
[01:23.000 --> 01:31.000]  It is incredibly illegal. Travel is a right, not a privilege. A passport is a right as a citizen.
[01:32.000 --> 01:37.000]  This represents withdrawing and revoking your citizenship. That's what it is under another name.
[01:37.000 --> 01:48.000]  They tried to pass a bill last year for any reason the President wishes outside of a court to take your citizenship away and then they say they can secretly arrest you or kill you.
[01:49.000 --> 01:53.000]  When he couldn't get that pass, he just signed the NDAA and said he can secretly arrest you or kill you.
[01:54.000 --> 01:57.000]  Well, a law that's unconstitutional is null and void, Marbury versus Madison.
[01:57.000 --> 02:06.000]  What this represents is capital controls. When governments start to collapse throughout history, they always try to clamp down on people leaving the country with money.
[02:07.000 --> 02:13.000]  Bottom line, the IRS is the collection agency for the private Federal Reserve.
[02:14.000 --> 02:22.000]  Pre-1913 dollars that were fiat were backed partially by Silver and Gold and said United States, note on them.
[02:22.000 --> 02:35.000]  After 1913, they said Federal Reserve, note. In 63, Kennedy reissued $5 bills that said United States, note on them.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  And he signed an executive order to begin the abolishment of the private Federal Reserve and its collection agency of the IRS.
[02:43.000 --> 02:52.000]  That's why the Banksters killed him. My point is, yes, a country has to have taxes, but these aren't taxes.
[02:53.000 --> 03:00.000]  These are levies to private international banks. Just as Europe admits, they're now under Goldman Sachs dictatorship.
[03:01.000 --> 03:07.000]  Not through money, they owe Goldman Sachs got their governments to sign on to the derivative fraud they created.
[03:07.000 --> 03:15.000]  This is so incredible. And now the Banksters are saying, if you don't pay all the taxes we want directly into our private coffers at the Federal Reserve,
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  outside of a court, outside of a conviction, outside of law, we're going to put you on a no fly list.
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  Just like Rahm Emanuel, former chief of staff at the White House, said at a gun grabber meeting.
[03:27.000 --> 03:32.000]  He said, look, if you're on a no fly list over 2 million Americans are on that, by the way, you're not going to be able to buy a gun.
[03:32.000 --> 03:42.000]  That is, if you are on the no fly list, because you are known as maybe a possible terrorist, you cannot buy a handgun in America.
[03:43.000 --> 03:51.000]  One of the things you don't know about is the number of people that we have turned away because their name has been on the watch list or on the no fly list.
[03:52.000 --> 03:57.000]  Only my mom could, but not me and my dad, because both me and my dad are on the watch list.
[03:57.000 --> 04:01.000]  Now they say they want to expand that to wherever you haven't paid your taxes, you can't buy a gun.
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  Of course, these are taxes to the IRS, and they just say you haven't paid.
[04:07.000 --> 04:12.000]  The Bankers are taking control of our lives. They are squeezing Europeans with the exact same system.
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.000]  This is hardcore fascism. This is incredible tyranny, and we've got to defeat this legislation that is now in the House.
[04:20.000 --> 04:26.000]  Get these articles and get them out to everybody and demand that the corporate or dinosaur media cover this.
[04:27.000 --> 04:33.000]  Because these are internal checkpoints, internal passports, and they're saying they're going to revoke your citizenship.
[04:34.000 --> 04:42.000]  That's what this does, extra judicially. This is off the Richter scale when it comes to despotic, oppressive tyranny.
[04:42.000 --> 04:55.000]  The Federal Reserve is engaged in a total coup d'etat over due process and threatening to revoke our citizenship and pull our passports if we don't fully submit to the bankers.
[04:56.000 --> 05:01.000]  The bankers are pressuring local governments to raise the local property tax that we didn't have until 60 years ago in this country.
[05:02.000 --> 05:05.000]  That turns your property into basically a government rental.
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  The worst drought in 50 years continues, and the first 6 months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record.
[05:12.000 --> 05:19.000]  78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions. Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[05:20.000 --> 05:24.000]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[05:25.000 --> 05:32.000]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now.
[05:32.000 --> 05:36.000]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  Now is the time to get your supply.
[05:39.000 --> 05:42.000]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we have all known this was coming.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  You know about their delicious long-term storable foods.
[05:46.000 --> 05:52.000]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today, and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[05:53.000 --> 05:58.000]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[05:58.000 --> 06:04.000]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. You can bet your life on eFoods direct.
[06:29.000 --> 06:33.000]  That's what's being broadcasted and transmitted.
[06:34.000 --> 06:42.000]  Streaming, you can listen at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com on this Thursday, August 16th, 2012 edition.
[06:43.000 --> 06:47.000]  There are thousands of articles, thousands.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  NBC News, you name it.
[06:53.000 --> 06:56.000]  Megadeth's Dave Mustaine says Obama is behind deadly shootings.
[06:56.000 --> 07:03.000]  And my name's been brought into this because he talked about the fact that he thinks the president's a criminal and a liar a few weeks ago on the show.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  I just interviewed Dave Mustaine. That's why we aired a few of our special reports the last 15 minutes.
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  I just went over to the TV side and did the interview with Dave.
[07:15.000 --> 07:17.000]  And it's a video interview. He's on the phone. It's video.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  We're transferring it over. It's about five minutes long.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  We will air it here on the radio.
[07:26.000 --> 07:43.000]  Probably right before we go to movie star and TV star and researcher, Richard Belzer, who has written dead wrong straight facts on the country's most controversial cover-ups about government shooting people and staging it and blaming patsies.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  Isn't that funny? We had this guest set up two weeks ago. Jesse Ventura wrote the forward. Here's the deal.
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  Operation Northwoods calls for shooting people in movie theaters and on the streets and blaming political enemies.
[07:54.000 --> 07:59.000]  Operation Gladio, hundreds of bombings and shootings in Europe carried out by NATO, partially declassified.
[08:00.000 --> 08:11.000]  The Italian government completely declassified it, blowing up school buses, shooting people, bombing theaters, shooting up theaters, shooting up churches, shooting up police stations to blame their political enemies, whether they be left or right wing.
[08:11.000 --> 08:18.000]  If the groups weren't controlled by the globalist, didn't want the bankers to take over like they've done now, you get a bombing or a shooting.
[08:19.000 --> 08:25.000]  Dave Mustaine has come out and said, hey, if they stage fast and furious, they'd stage this. We got to look at it.
[08:26.000 --> 08:27.000]  He said at a concert overseas.
[08:28.000 --> 08:37.000]  And we've been talking on the phone lately about the Sikhs president saying he saw multiple people casing it, witnesses all saying four shooters.
[08:37.000 --> 08:43.000]  That's what was reported. We need to look at this. We'd be idiots if we didn't. It's time to stop trusting the system.
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  Now, I'll tell you, this is breaking just like with the Dixie chicks saying they didn't agree with the war.
[08:49.000 --> 08:52.000]  They're trying to cancel his tours. They're trying to persecute Dave Mustaine right now.
[08:53.000 --> 09:00.000]  Like Chick-fil-A, even if you don't agree with what Chick-fil-A did, you've got to support the First Amendment with these bullies.
[09:00.000 --> 09:11.000]  Guy went in and shot up the family research group, the family research council yesterday with bunch of Chick-fil-A stuff saying he was mad at them.
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  Okay, these are terrorists. You've got to support the First Amendment.
[09:16.000 --> 09:19.000]  And we will have that exclusive Dave Mustaine statement coming up.
[09:20.000 --> 09:25.000]  Quite frankly, he said stuff after the Batman shooting and interview we taped after the show one day.
[09:25.000 --> 09:30.000]  I didn't even air it because I didn't want this big controversy. Even though I knew in the end he'd come out smelling like a rose,
[09:31.000 --> 09:34.000]  I just don't like my friends having this stuff happen to him on my show.
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  That's happened a lot of times, but they're going to come after him, folks.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  They're going to come after him. They didn't go after Larry Pratt because he's a Fox News contributor.
[09:43.000 --> 09:46.000]  That doesn't fit into their whole game plan. They think he's a good target.
[09:46.000 --> 09:54.000]  And now we're going to talk about the economy, the accelerating world events with the premier trends forecaster joining us via video Skype right now.
[09:55.000 --> 09:59.000]  He is Gerald Salente for the balance of the hour, and there's so much I want to get into.
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  I mean, there is so much that I want to break down. They're about to dump Biden right now.
[10:06.000 --> 10:08.000]  That's the writing on the wall. We'll get his take on that.
[10:08.000 --> 10:16.000]  We have got just amazing stuff, federal courts ruling that cell phone tracking is legal just throwing out the Fourth Amendment.
[10:17.000 --> 10:25.000]  You've been called a pessimist porn dealer, Gerald Salente of the Trends Journal, for predicting with precision everything that's happening,
[10:26.000 --> 10:35.000]  the wars, the Tea Party years before it came, the attacks on small businesses, the rebellion, the meltdown of derivatives that we were really in a depression and never left the recession.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  All of that confirmed are saying get the banks ready for collapse.
[10:40.000 --> 10:46.000]  The elites are all buying gold up that was in the news, sorrows the rest of them, literally everything you've said.
[10:47.000 --> 10:52.000]  But you don't get praised by the corporate prostitutes, you invented that word for telling the truth.
[10:53.000 --> 10:56.000]  You get even more demonized as it all unfolds.
[10:57.000 --> 11:03.000]  So you've told us what's coming. Tell us, and it's come true, tell us what's coming now, Gerald Salente.
[11:03.000 --> 11:12.000]  What's coming now unfortunately looks like our worst scenario forecast that we've made recently.
[11:13.000 --> 11:16.000]  And that's the first great war of the 21st century.
[11:17.000 --> 11:19.000]  And people refuse to put the pieces together.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  Whether it's what's going on in Syria is very clear.
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  This is a move to limit the power of Iran and Hezbollah.
[11:28.000 --> 11:34.000]  People forget that Israel lost against Lebanon in that last war.
[11:35.000 --> 11:39.000]  And one of the reasons why was they were getting armaments from Iran and Syria.
[11:40.000 --> 11:45.000]  The other issue of course is when you move beyond that, there's a revolution going on in Yemen.
[11:46.000 --> 11:53.000]  And they're very concerned because Yemen backs up to Saudi Arabia, which as everyone knows is the greatest oil producer on the planet.
[11:53.000 --> 12:02.000]  And the people there are very unhappy. And I know that this may sound contrary to all those fairy tales that were all taught as little boys and girls.
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.000]  They don't like the king. The king. How about calling him a dictator?
[12:09.000 --> 12:10.000]  Oh no, he's a king.
[12:11.000 --> 12:13.000]  Hey ladies, you want a free Afghanistan, right?
[12:14.000 --> 12:15.000]  I hear all that all the time.
[12:15.000 --> 12:22.000]  You can't drive a car in the kingdom, so you have a revolution going on there that's spilling over.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  Bahrain is ready to go up in flames.
[12:26.000 --> 12:27.000]  Greece is cooked.
[12:28.000 --> 12:33.000]  You have an unemployment rate of over 25%, just officially.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  And then youth unemployment over 50%.
[12:37.000 --> 12:38.000]  You see what's going on in Spain.
[12:38.000 --> 12:47.000]  They don't report the millions of indignados that are taking to the streets to, it's turned back.
[12:48.000 --> 13:03.000]  You know how I talk about Alex that the timelines are parallels to the crash of 29, the Great Depression, the currency wars, trade wars, world war, the panic of 08, the Great Depression, slash Great Recession, currency wars are going on.
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  The trade wars and world wars, Spain.
[13:09.000 --> 13:10.000]  So just play back into that.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  It's a replay almost of the 1930s.
[13:15.000 --> 13:17.000]  Just the names and the situations have changed.
[13:18.000 --> 13:23.000]  The people are in Franco era depression levels.
[13:24.000 --> 13:27.000]  Oh, and then over there in France.
[13:28.000 --> 13:30.000]  Yeah, they just got a new president over there.
[13:30.000 --> 13:38.000]  And you read the language in the toilet paper of record, the New York Times, the Soul Proclaimed Paper of Record.
[13:39.000 --> 13:44.000]  They have a little story there about the riots going on in France.
[13:45.000 --> 13:47.000]  And you know who's writing?
[13:48.000 --> 13:56.000]  Hey, those people from when they used to, remember those French used to take over Algeria, Morocco, and then all those people came over to France.
[13:57.000 --> 13:58.000]  Yeah, them.
[13:58.000 --> 13:59.000]  And you know who them is?
[14:00.000 --> 14:06.000]  Them are the 50% of the youth unemployment demographic.
[14:07.000 --> 14:09.000]  It's unemployment worldwide.
[14:10.000 --> 14:14.000]  You know my saying, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[14:15.000 --> 14:16.000]  They're losing it around the world.
[14:17.000 --> 14:18.000]  The war has begun.
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.000]  I read your website and I see what you're posting on there about the hollow point bullets.
[14:24.000 --> 14:32.000]  We all know about the National Defense Authorization Act, about all the armaments going into our military police,
[14:33.000 --> 14:41.000]  because now they've both become one with the National Defense Authorization Act and the repeal of the 1878 Kameh Posatadas Act,
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  Pasecoma Tatas Act that allows the military to take over police duties.
[14:49.000 --> 14:50.000]  So yes, the whole thing is collapsing.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  And now, of course, we gotta run.
[14:54.000 --> 14:55.000]  Gotta go after a run.
[14:56.000 --> 14:57.000]  And what are the reports out?
[14:58.000 --> 14:59.000]  I'm not making this up.
[15:00.000 --> 15:01.000]  This is coming out of Israel.
[15:02.000 --> 15:04.000]  They're preparing the people for a 30-day war?
[15:05.000 --> 15:06.000]  What psychopath came up with this idea?
[15:07.000 --> 15:08.000]  30 days?
[15:09.000 --> 15:10.000]  Oh, you could put a timeline on it.
[15:11.000 --> 15:12.000]  They're nuts.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  They're out of their minds and they're taking the people to war.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  In the meantime, let's go look at some economic data.
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  Oh, China, you know what China's export numbers were last month?
[15:25.000 --> 15:26.000]  How about 1% growth?
[15:27.000 --> 15:28.000]  Virtually nothing.
[15:29.000 --> 15:32.000]  Their imports were only 4%.
[15:33.000 --> 15:39.000]  You look at Brazil, they just announced a $66 billion stimulus program.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  The real is crashing, the Indian rupee is in the toilet,
[15:46.000 --> 15:48.000]  and they're trying to stop people from buying gold.
[15:49.000 --> 15:53.000]  Oh, and you mentioned that Soros and Paulson are blowing up tons of gold.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  Oh, but they're brilliant.
[15:56.000 --> 15:59.000]  When Saletti says it, oh, he's a glutinous tumor.
[16:00.000 --> 16:01.000]  Oh, you can't eat gold.
[16:02.000 --> 16:03.000]  Oh, you can't eat gold?
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  How about shoving this?
[16:06.000 --> 16:07.000]  Oh, no, I have to be clean.
[16:07.000 --> 16:08.000]  Ok, let's move on to that.
[16:37.000 --> 16:42.440]  water from lake streams, ponds, and wells. This filter system leaves in beneficial minerals,
[16:42.440 --> 16:47.320]  which is key. Save money by not buying bottled water and avoid BPA that leaches from the plastic.
[16:47.320 --> 16:52.920]  Propyr is the best gravity-fed filter out there. It's what my family uses. Infowars.com
[16:52.920 --> 16:57.640]  already has the lowest price on Propyr. But if you add the promo code water at checkout,

[17:10.200 --> 17:16.520]  planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies
[17:16.520 --> 17:21.720]  and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why we've assembled
[17:21.720 --> 17:28.520]  the most vital and important preparedness items at Infowars.com. These are items that I did research

[20:01.720 --> 20:04.280]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[20:04.280 --> 20:21.960]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:34.280 --> 20:54.440]  This sounds like a song about drones. Where they got 20,000 of them
[20:56.520 --> 20:59.560]  flying around bombing whole villages to kill one person.
[20:59.560 --> 21:08.360]  Oh, but people that do that wouldn't stage a mass shooting. You know why? Because they're so courageous.
[21:11.720 --> 21:12.920]  So courageous.
[21:19.800 --> 21:25.880]  We've got the exclusive Dave Mustaine clarification on Obama staging the mass shootings. We have the
[21:25.880 --> 21:33.000]  video. We have the audio. We'll air it after Gerald Salente leaves this either before our next guest,
[21:33.000 --> 21:39.000]  author, TV host, movie star Richard Belzer joins us or after. I'm not sure, but this is like in
[21:39.000 --> 21:42.920]  thousands of newspapers right now and we're going to hit them and hit them hard. Now you can go to
[21:42.920 --> 21:48.680]  trendsresearch.com and find the Trends Journal or you can also go to trendsjournal.com. It takes
[21:48.680 --> 21:56.440]  you to the same place. Invaluable info. I must read. Check it out today. Again, Gerald Salente
[21:56.440 --> 22:01.320]  joins us. I want to go through some of the economic news because, you know, we laugh and joke about
[22:01.320 --> 22:05.480]  this. He had a lot of money, six figures plus stolen from him. We'll leave it at that. Gerald
[22:05.480 --> 22:12.520]  Salente. But it wasn't stolen. It was tapped. First they say in the same article it disappeared,
[22:13.080 --> 22:17.480]  but then it was tapped. You know, it disappeared like into JP Morgan's pocket as he and Max
[22:17.480 --> 22:23.400]  Kaiser said now back in October, November. And now it's confirmed JP Morgan London got it.
[22:23.400 --> 22:30.200]  HSBC is in mainstream news running drugs just like Wacovia, Wells Fargo in the hundreds of
[22:30.200 --> 22:37.160]  billions a year. Those guys running the torture aircraft, running the drug aircraft, stealing
[22:37.160 --> 22:42.920]  people's pension funds, selling into the market stuff that they know is worthless. Crud bragging
[22:42.920 --> 22:47.000]  about it. Those emails are out there, but they're just tapping it when they lie to an old lady and
[22:47.000 --> 22:52.040]  sell her fraud with Denver Wolf. And now we said this months before you said it, we said it. I
[22:52.040 --> 22:56.680]  mean, it's not like we're even that smart. We're just not total idiot chump suckers who love being
[22:56.680 --> 23:02.760]  taken for a ride every day. I mean, you rape me 10 or 15 times. I'm not gonna trust you anymore.
[23:02.760 --> 23:08.520]  That's why we're extremists, pessimists, porn bad people. We talked about Zuckerberg and Facebook
[23:08.520 --> 23:13.720]  and the fact that even mainline groups were saying it was overvalued by 10 times at least.
[23:13.720 --> 23:19.480]  Some estimates were 20 times, but it was 10, 15. They're in that area, it varied. And of course,
[23:19.480 --> 23:24.360]  they were allowed to dump up front and then dump later. And they're dumping and it's totally illegal,
[23:24.360 --> 23:29.160]  but they sent Martha Stewart and they're trying to get the owner of the Mavericks who criticized Bush
[23:29.160 --> 23:34.520]  who didn't engage in insider trading. Clearly, they're going after them because, oh, look,
[23:34.520 --> 23:40.120]  we get the bad men. There's the bad men. There's the bad woman, but not the real crooks that make
[23:40.120 --> 23:45.800]  Bernie Madoff and Kinley look honest. What do you say about Facebook here, Gerald Salente?
[23:45.800 --> 23:51.240]  And the fact that now the criminality is just parading around and the prostitutes, as you said,
[23:51.240 --> 23:56.040]  are saying the sky's the limit. I mean, I guess that's why judges think they can say no Fourth
[23:56.040 --> 24:01.320]  Amendment now because the media will cover their evil work covered patutes. I mean, what is the
[24:01.320 --> 24:09.080]  end? Once corruption in history, as you know, reaches this festering point when the Pustule pops
[24:09.080 --> 24:14.680]  and just day loses us in the scrawfield of stink. Where are we going here? I'm ranting. I'm sorry.
[24:15.640 --> 24:19.800]  Well, on the Facebook issue, you know, we have trends in the news as part of the subscription
[24:19.800 --> 24:25.080]  for the Trends Journal. And when the IPO came out, I said, I'm not telling people how to invest.
[24:25.080 --> 24:30.200]  I don't give investment advice. I'm a forecaster and I'm forecasting that this thing is going to
[24:30.200 --> 24:36.440]  dump out and I would not put my money in it. And the reason is because it's all you got to get
[24:36.440 --> 24:41.320]  advertising and people use Facebook for what it is. You know, who looks at the advertising,
[24:41.320 --> 24:47.880]  people blast right by it. The other issue, of course, being it's a fact. It's not a trend.
[24:47.880 --> 24:55.400]  I wrote in trend tracking in 1996, what they're calling social networking. I call the techno
[24:55.400 --> 25:01.160]  tribalism. It has much more richness than just bs-ing back and forth to people. So we knew it
[25:01.160 --> 25:07.080]  was a bust. Where is it all going? And as we look at, we talked about LIBOR. We're talking about
[25:07.080 --> 25:13.400]  all the criminality going on in all the different levels. You mentioned HSBC. You could go down
[25:13.400 --> 25:20.040]  the list one fine after another. No one's head rolls and it just keeps going. The fish rots
[25:20.040 --> 25:26.840]  in the head down. The entire system in the United States, as you look at it, is nothing more than
[25:26.840 --> 25:33.240]  a fish rotting within morality. How about that lovely war over there in Afghanistan?
[25:33.240 --> 25:38.920]  Hey, all you Obama nieces, remember when he had that troop surge?
[25:45.800 --> 25:51.480]  Bravo. Bravo. Yeah. What did today? A helicopter got shot down?
[25:51.480 --> 25:58.680]  Well, another seven Americans dead. Oh, yeah, impressive progress. Yeah, sure. What happened
[25:58.680 --> 26:05.000]  last week? Oh, you know that transition military that you're putting in place? Yeah, they're
[26:05.000 --> 26:13.000]  killing our soldiers. How many guys got killed? Eh, what's a dozen or so? Even those senators'
[26:13.000 --> 26:19.880]  sons? Oh, let me just digress a little bit. I love the latest episode of the Presidential
[26:19.880 --> 26:29.960]  Reality Show. It was the perfect metaphor for America. Romney and Ryan standing in front of a
[26:29.960 --> 26:36.920]  mothball battleship. Mothballs? Maybe that's what these guys are carrying around with them,
[26:36.920 --> 26:43.800]  because it was the perfect metaphor. Two little chicken hawks talking tough with a decommissioned
[26:43.800 --> 26:49.960]  ship that was at a standstill. They stopped battleships before the end of World War II. And
[26:51.400 --> 26:56.680]  they're the tough talking guys, right? No one's talking about cutting the military.
[26:56.680 --> 27:02.040]  So as we're looking at the fish rotting from the head down, we talked about the military,
[27:02.040 --> 27:09.240]  we talked about the economy. Now, I'm a guy still living in the Bronx and of a different head.
[27:09.240 --> 27:14.600]  And I'd say to my buddy Joey, listen, we're going to go do a deal. Now, here's what we're
[27:14.600 --> 27:18.840]  going to do. And Joey says, with the other guys, and we all said Joey charged up,
[27:18.840 --> 27:23.160]  hey, Gerald, come on, that's not honest. Man, we're going to rip somebody off like that. I'd
[27:23.160 --> 27:28.840]  say, what are you, stupid? What's the matter with you? Look at this, stealing at the top.
[27:29.560 --> 27:36.120]  They're robbing us every day. They stuck your mother's house. She's out on the street. Your
[27:36.120 --> 27:43.960]  father ain't got a job. Your brother died in Iraq. You know, why do you stupid? They're ripping us
[27:43.960 --> 27:50.600]  off at every level and you're going to play it straight. All the society is rotting out
[27:50.600 --> 27:57.480]  because it's rotting from the head of Obama. It's rotted from the head of Bush and Chady.
[27:57.480 --> 28:03.800]  It's rotten like Romney and Ryan. And you know how I say, Alex, I've been saying it for years
[28:03.800 --> 28:10.120]  since you've known me, that these guys that everybody's sucking up and bowing down to
[28:10.120 --> 28:16.120]  are nothing more than the class presidents and head of the student council. And now they followed
[28:16.120 --> 28:24.280]  their career path. It could not be clearer than with Paul, little high school altar boy, Ryan.
[28:24.280 --> 28:29.880]  It's great. The altar boy and a guy that wears the magic underwear, the Mormon. It's perfect.
[28:29.880 --> 28:38.280]  It's right out of the presidential reality show. Paul Ryan voted by his classmates who are smarter
[28:38.280 --> 28:45.480]  than everybody else out there as high school kids as the brown noser of the year. I'm not making it
[28:45.480 --> 28:53.240]  up. It's there. The class president, a guy that never worked a day in his life, born on third base
[28:53.240 --> 29:01.480]  like Romney and thinks he hits a triple and people clap like little children all aboard next train
[29:01.480 --> 29:09.640]  to Auschwitz. That's where this country's going. The Silver Lungs Generator is the only all-encompassing

[30:07.640 --> 30:13.400]  and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt
[30:13.400 --> 30:18.200]  is in drought conditions. Not only corn but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all
[30:18.200 --> 30:23.400]  impacted raising prices. The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business
[30:23.400 --> 30:28.440]  blowing up your food prices. The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to
[30:28.440 --> 30:33.240]  today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now. As the price of

[32:05.480 --> 32:10.280]  Supernatural silver is not an ionic or a colloidal silver. It is a nano-catalytic
[32:10.280 --> 32:14.920]  silver salt technology with superior benefits to the colloidal silvers of yesterday.

[33:27.640 --> 33:41.480]  The big one of course is what's going on in the Middle East.
[33:41.480 --> 33:47.880]  Another one, September 12th is going to be a big day. You asked me the timeline on collapse.
[33:48.600 --> 33:54.440]  That's the day that the German Supreme Court is supposed to rule on whether or not it's
[33:54.440 --> 34:02.200]  constitutional for the German government to be into the mechanisms they call them that are
[34:02.200 --> 34:07.400]  dumping all of this funneling all this money into bailout the troubled countries.
[34:08.440 --> 34:15.080]  And it's also another element of that lawsuit that they'll be deciding. And the German Supreme
[34:15.080 --> 34:21.800]  Court, ostensibly, is not a politically rigged court like the one we have here.
[34:21.800 --> 34:27.560]  That's what they say. We'll see by their deeds. And the other issue is whether or not
[34:28.600 --> 34:34.760]  the Germans are actually going to lose their sovereignty as well as the rest of the Europeans
[34:34.760 --> 34:42.280]  by putting the banking structures completely into Brussels. So how the Supreme Court of
[34:42.280 --> 34:49.640]  Germany rules on August, excuse me, September 12th on whether or not they could continue in
[34:49.640 --> 34:56.920]  these bailout funds and these emergency funds and these bond buying schemes is going to determine
[34:56.920 --> 35:05.560]  the future of the Euro. Because if they say which it is, by the way, unconstitutional,
[35:06.440 --> 35:14.200]  as it is established by the German constitution to continue like this, Germany is the only one
[35:14.200 --> 35:21.560]  holding it up. That means the whole Eurozone collapses. Number two, again, I am not giving
[35:21.560 --> 35:29.960]  financial advice just to make this clear. My timeline on gold. Gold today is up about $13
[35:29.960 --> 35:40.760]  as we speak. Gold has to break above 1670. I believe it's about 1613 now. It has to go about
[35:40.760 --> 35:51.560]  1670. And then the next hit up to that is 1750. Once it goes over 1750, it's back to the 2000 mark.
[35:51.560 --> 35:56.520]  And it could happen overnight. Continue, my brother. You are laying it out. I mean,
[35:56.520 --> 35:59.560]  where do you see it ending? Where do you see it going if we don't turn this around?
[36:00.440 --> 36:05.800]  Declare martial law on the people. They're going to go after guys like you and me. They're going
[36:05.800 --> 36:11.880]  to go after everybody that speaks out and calls them out on their crap. What an adult can believe
[36:11.880 --> 36:17.400]  this stupid, cheap show. Did you see Obama? What in the hell does this guy work? He's
[36:17.400 --> 36:23.080]  been out on a campaign trail every day. Every four years, this is where you can find these guys.
[36:23.080 --> 36:28.520]  He'll be at Pete's Barbecue, sitting on a baler. Hey, there's Obama in front of a whole bunch
[36:28.520 --> 36:36.280]  of rotted corn. Every four years, Freddie's clam house, sitting there at Maggie's diner.
[36:38.280 --> 36:41.240]  For the first time, even businesses that don't like them for the business
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.160]  are telling them you're not welcome here and they're getting ready to dump Biden,
[36:45.160 --> 36:50.440]  hoping that wakes people back up. Clearly, they've got all the signs on that front. So I do see an
[36:50.440 --> 36:55.160]  awakening happening, but you're right. The level of tyranny we will live under, as Thomas Jefferson
[36:55.160 --> 37:01.240]  said, is the exact amount we'll put up with. So now that they're so cornered like rats,
[37:01.240 --> 37:05.480]  you've said they implode the economy, then they start a war to distract everybody.
[37:05.480 --> 37:10.040]  But do you think that's going to work? I mean, even most of the Israelis don't want a war.
[37:10.040 --> 37:19.240]  It will work. We sent out a trend alert. We wrote about Ryan in last year. You got it. Last
[37:19.240 --> 37:26.520]  summer's Trends Journal, that whole one about direct democracy. And we had a thing. We even had
[37:26.520 --> 37:33.240]  Ryan's Weenie Mobile. And we showed what a little nobody this guy is and why would anybody listen
[37:33.240 --> 37:39.560]  to this jerk who never did a damn thing in his life. And I love the term they give, lawmakers.
[37:39.560 --> 37:44.120]  I don't need a lawmaker. Who made that? Would you go to school for lawmaking? And so here,
[37:44.120 --> 37:48.680]  this guy, we wrote all about him. So we sent out a piece we also had in that piece.
[37:48.680 --> 37:54.040]  Remember the guy where we wrote about the Weenie Mobile? We wrote about the other Weener, Richard
[37:54.040 --> 38:01.560]  Weener, the guy that got caught showing his stuff off on TV, on the Internet. We wrote about both
[38:01.560 --> 38:09.880]  of them. This is a year ago. People writing to us canceling their subscriptions because we said
[38:09.880 --> 38:17.160]  what they didn't like about Ryan. We could go after Obama. They don't care. But you go after
[38:17.160 --> 38:24.120]  their ideologue. And boy, do they get tight. If you don't like their freak, there's something wrong
[38:24.120 --> 38:31.000]  with you. My freak is better than your freak. Oh, the Romney freak is better than the Obama freak.
[38:31.000 --> 38:37.240]  How come you don't like my freak? It's a freak show. How could any adult look at this adolescent
[38:37.240 --> 38:43.080]  act that they call the presidential reality show and buy into it? It's a disgrace.
[38:43.080 --> 38:51.560]  Well said, shifting gears to the war front and other areas that deal with that. Syrian rebels
[38:51.560 --> 38:56.200]  who've always been al-Qaeda-led, warm they will turn to al-Qaeda if the West fails them.
[38:56.920 --> 39:00.920]  And they also say that our troops have to grow the opium or al-Qaeda will get it. I mean,
[39:00.920 --> 39:04.120]  I guess now they'll need your daughters as well or al-Qaeda will get them.
[39:04.840 --> 39:08.600]  Let the globalists have their way with them or al-Qaeda will pill for them.
[39:08.600 --> 39:14.200]  Continuing, Israel urges US decision on Iran's strike. Why not news? Here's another one. Israel
[39:14.200 --> 39:18.360]  minister warns of 30-day war with Iran. You mentioned that at the start of the interview.
[39:18.360 --> 39:23.640]  Khomeini, Zionist regime will disappear from map. Israel military blast heard in southern city.
[39:23.640 --> 39:28.520]  Rockets believed to be falling. Seven American soldiers dead in Afghan chopper crash. They
[39:28.520 --> 39:35.640]  never get shot down. It's always a chopper crash. Continuing, all of this is going on.
[39:35.640 --> 39:39.000]  And then the economic news, even Fox News runs the headline,
[39:39.000 --> 39:45.800]  the coming economic collapse and breaks down the numbers. Again, they've always known this
[39:45.800 --> 39:50.040]  because they're imploding it to take over. But the fact that they're now admitting they're
[39:50.040 --> 39:54.040]  getting ready for a collapse. What's your time frame on that? I know you're in generalities
[39:54.040 --> 39:58.200]  because no one knows exactly. But I mean, we're talking about this fall next year.
[39:58.200 --> 40:00.680]  Max Kaiser says by next April. Because then-
[40:00.680 --> 40:06.040]  It could happen next week. You see, they keep coming up with these schemes.
[40:06.840 --> 40:12.440]  Nobody knew about the $26 trillion that the Fed was pumping into the system.
[40:12.440 --> 40:17.320]  Nobody knew that they were rigging the rates and lying about with LIBOR to cover up-
[40:17.320 --> 40:21.480]  So it's all rigged. It's all rigged. But the real economy is dying.
[40:21.480 --> 40:26.520]  Yeah. So the timeline is really, really difficult to go on. But you mentioned about
[40:27.080 --> 40:30.600]  how the media looks at me. I know people in the media and they all tell me.
[40:30.600 --> 40:35.160]  And I have friends that are agents and different people and they say,
[40:35.160 --> 40:40.760]  every time they mention my name, they say, no, no, no. He scares people when he has to say,
[40:40.760 --> 40:46.280]  you know, we don't want to hear that. He unsettles people. Oh, what a word.
[40:46.280 --> 40:47.240]  Don't settle anything.
[40:47.240 --> 40:52.120]  Obama, Obama, Obama.
[40:52.120 --> 40:58.840]  No, no, but exactly. That's a badge of distinction and honor, a red badge of courage that I've had
[40:58.840 --> 41:03.400]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Washington Post, all with reporters here.
[41:03.400 --> 41:07.080]  To the point of now, I go, no, you can't come to a profile.
[41:07.080 --> 41:09.480]  I don't care if your editor said it's allowed to go out.
[41:10.200 --> 41:14.520]  People above that will kill it because they think not recognizing us keeps us down.
[41:14.520 --> 41:17.240]  It's the opposite. If you ever recognized this, it would hurt us.
[41:17.240 --> 41:23.320]  You are like poison, garbage. You're the plague. I'm running from you.
[41:23.320 --> 41:26.120]  And the point is, is they always call back after they've been here and they go,
[41:26.120 --> 41:29.240]  you're right. They killed it from the corporate above the editors.
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.160]  And I'm like, exactly. So now I say, oh, the editor says you can come to town.
[41:33.160 --> 41:36.440]  I know it's a hit piece. I don't mind a hit piece. That helps me when you attack me.
[41:36.440 --> 41:40.200]  But I said, do this, have your editor go above the corporate.
[41:40.200 --> 41:42.120]  Just so, and they go, oh my gosh, you're right.
[41:42.120 --> 41:45.160]  I had the Washington Post call me a few weeks ago, you know, this big writer.
[41:45.160 --> 41:47.560]  And I'm like, oh no, anything I've ever done gets published.
[41:47.560 --> 41:49.560]  I say, okay, go ahead and write your article.
[41:49.560 --> 41:52.920]  He goes, it'll be this Sunday. You watch. Never was in the paper.
[41:52.920 --> 41:58.920]  Because again, they're scared and they act like we're the ones destroying confidence.
[41:58.920 --> 42:03.240]  No, no, no, the Chinese government won't buy US stocks anymore because they know it's rigged.
[42:03.240 --> 42:08.040]  That's why we're not. In fact, I get this a lot. I see this about you, but I get this a lot.
[42:08.040 --> 42:12.360]  I'm causing the problems. I'm the reason there's a loss of confidence.
[42:12.360 --> 42:16.040]  Don't listen to that guy or we'll have a depression. Hey, I got news for you.
[42:16.040 --> 42:19.560]  Four years ago, we passed the Rubicon by every real economic standard.
[42:19.560 --> 42:24.200]  I've had countless economists on. I've researched it. We were in a depression four years ago.
[42:24.200 --> 42:30.120]  Okay, okay, I'm not doing it because I'm right. It's not Gerald's fault that he's right.
[42:30.120 --> 42:34.040]  We're trying to pull this country out of it. I like what Gerald says.
[42:34.040 --> 42:36.360]  Most people I know are trying to leave the country. It's global.
[42:36.360 --> 42:40.840]  You're not leaving, folks. It's going worldwide. I'm staying here. I'm fighting.
[42:40.840 --> 42:44.920]  Go ahead, Gerald. I'm sorry. Oh, no, you're right on here.
[42:44.920 --> 42:52.680]  This is why, remember that? The prostitutes, that are the prostitutes. That's all they are.
[42:52.680 --> 43:00.760]  There's not a man among them, not a man, barely a man in Congress, nobody in the Senate,
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.520]  certainly nobody in the executive offices.
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.240]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans,
[43:13.240 --> 43:20.120]  here is the Cal Bend Soap Company. Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years.

[44:09.320 --> 44:14.600]  marks the hottest half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[44:14.600 --> 44:19.960]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices.
[44:19.960 --> 44:24.360]  The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food
[44:24.360 --> 44:29.480]  prices. The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to today's prices by
[44:29.480 --> 44:34.680]  getting your own supply of foods from e-foods direct now. As the price of raw ingredients increases,
[44:34.680 --> 44:39.320]  e-foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I recently increased my
[44:39.320 --> 44:43.560]  supply from e-foods direct because we've all known this was coming. You know about their delicious
[44:43.560 --> 44:48.440]  long-term storable foods. The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today and because it
[44:48.440 --> 44:52.840]  stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost. Don't

[45:07.160 --> 45:12.440]  great way to beat the blackouts. Get off the grid and generate your own supply of electrical power.
[45:12.440 --> 45:16.200]  Folks, from what's been going on in this country, I don't have to tell you about the power grid and
[45:16.200 --> 45:21.480]  just how vulnerable it is. That's in the mainstream news every day. Millions of people have lost their
[45:21.480 --> 45:26.360]  power in the last few weeks because of dangerous storms and killer heat that's pushing the grid
[45:26.360 --> 45:32.120]  beyond its capacity. I've always said that every family needs to be ready for blackouts and if you
[45:32.120 --> 45:36.920]  don't have a backup system in place, I've got a great opportunity for you. Right now our good
[45:36.920 --> 45:42.920]  friends at Solutions from Science are offering huge savings on their best-selling power hub unit.
[45:42.920 --> 45:48.040]  In fact, I think it's the best deal I've ever seen them make. It's literally thousands of dollars
[45:48.040 --> 45:53.320]  in savings. Remember, these backup systems don't need gas because they're solar powered. That means
[45:53.320 --> 46:00.920]  there's no dangerous fumes and no noise. InfoWars listeners can get all the details at beattheblackouts.com.

[48:02.120 --> 48:09.800]  Illusions, Mr. Wordsworth. Illusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you
[48:09.800 --> 48:15.800]  have a strength when you have no strength at all. You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream
[48:15.800 --> 48:35.640]  and the state has no use for your crime. Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[48:45.800 --> 49:01.000]  Alex Jones here with a message that could revolutionize health in this country. If we
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.040]  want to defeat the globalist, we have to understand they're using medical tyranny against us,
[49:06.040 --> 49:10.840]  but to get us into that globalist controlled system, they want to make us unhealthy. The
[49:10.840 --> 49:16.280]  globalists spike our water with sodium fluoride, and they admit it causes massive increases in
[49:16.280 --> 49:22.440]  bone cancer, brain damage, and reduced IQs. The GMO crops have all been directly linked
[49:22.440 --> 49:29.160]  to reduced fertility, deformities in mammals across the board. The globalists in these school
[49:29.160 --> 49:36.200]  lunch programs feed children absolute garbage. Fast food is full of chemical additives, things like
[49:36.200 --> 49:43.080]  silicone. We are all under attack because when we're operating from a healthy position of good
[49:43.080 --> 49:50.600]  food, natural food, clean water, and the nutrients and trace elements we need, our minds will be on
[49:50.600 --> 49:56.840]  fire. The powerful, creative human destiny will be unleashed. Now I want to tell you a very important
[49:56.840 --> 50:03.400]  story. Going back about a year and a half ago, I began to learn from friends like Ted Anderson
[50:03.400 --> 50:08.760]  about the incredible health effects of young Jevity products. And I started promoting him
[50:08.760 --> 50:13.560]  some because I'd seen his weight loss, his health, all the things that happened for him.
[50:13.560 --> 50:18.440]  And by the way, things like Beyond Tangy Tangerine and Polymers Plus are not even
[50:18.440 --> 50:23.400]  advertised for weight loss. It's just that when you take it, you are getting the minerals and
[50:23.400 --> 50:30.040]  vitamins you need from an original plant form, and so you're full because the main crops that are
[50:30.040 --> 50:37.400]  grown on these debilitated, plate out soils are not giving you the minerals and vitamins you need.
[50:37.400 --> 50:42.760]  So you eat and you eat and you eat and get raw calories that pack on weight and that burn out
[50:43.400 --> 50:48.520]  your different glands and cause things like diabetes. When you finally start getting the
[50:48.520 --> 50:53.240]  minerals and vitamins and trace elements you need, it is incredible. Now I've only stuck my
[50:53.240 --> 50:59.880]  toe in the water and lost a little over 40 pounds and I'm still big. Aaron Dykes, who you know has
[50:59.880 --> 51:06.040]  been working here for six years at infowars.com, lost 92 pounds. We're going to show you some
[51:06.040 --> 51:11.000]  before and afters. He began to hear the guest on my show a year and a half ago. He began to do his
[51:11.000 --> 51:18.120]  own research and he implemented the information that young Jevity and infowarsteam.com is promoting
[51:18.120 --> 51:25.160]  and had dramatic results. And that's why I'm telling our listeners and viewers, you need to go to
[51:25.160 --> 51:32.040]  infowarsteam.com and try just the essential fatty acids, the Beyond Tangy Tangerine and the Polymers
[51:32.040 --> 51:38.040]  Plus. And I believe you'll be blown away by the dramatic results that I've had and Aaron's had.
[51:38.040 --> 51:43.640]  Aaron, break down what happened, your story. I've been overweight in my life for far too long.
[51:43.640 --> 51:48.680]  Years ago, I lost a lot of weight, more than 50 pounds, but it came right back. I wasn't able to
[51:48.680 --> 51:54.040]  keep it off. More recently, I've worked really hard with diet and exercise to try to lose weight,
[51:54.040 --> 51:58.680]  but I just didn't get the results. It just didn't happen and I wasn't able to stay motivated long
[51:58.680 --> 52:03.240]  enough to reach my goals. Then I saw what you were doing with infowarsteam.com and the great
[52:03.240 --> 52:08.280]  products Tangy Tangerine, kind of the base one to start with. I wasn't even trying to lose weight,
[52:08.280 --> 52:11.960]  but I got it because I wanted to feel better energy. I wanted that nutrition. Didn't even
[52:11.960 --> 52:17.400]  understand how that could kickstart my own weight loss goals, but the products did that for me.
[52:17.400 --> 52:22.440]  I found myself suddenly losing weight, more energetic, wanting to exercise, wanting to eat
[52:22.440 --> 52:27.080]  the right foods. And they don't even advertise it as weight loss. They don't, but pharmacist
[52:27.080 --> 52:30.440]  Ben Fuchs explains that's what happens if you're overweight because you're no longer hungry because
[52:30.440 --> 52:34.280]  you're getting what you need. It was a perfect storm because it was giving my body the nutrients it
[52:34.280 --> 52:40.040]  needs. It gave my body the things it needs to seek out first, which made me not have to crave
[52:40.040 --> 52:45.160]  after other things that I don't need, that don't even provide nutrition. And what's crazy is this
[52:45.160 --> 52:50.760]  is not advertised as weight loss. The company never even promoted it. We just discovered it's
[52:50.760 --> 52:55.800]  the ultimate weight loss tool. Not only is it incredible that the infowarsteam.com products
[52:55.800 --> 52:59.800]  were hidden in blame view, but that there's no teleprompters here. You know, Aaron, you want
[52:59.800 --> 53:03.560]  to endorse these products because everybody on air has seen the amazing transformation.
[53:03.560 --> 53:07.080]  They've seen me lose quite a bit of weight, but I haven't totally committed to it like you have.
[53:07.080 --> 53:13.800]  And we're here just telling people the effects that it's had for us. And by the way, just a week
[53:13.800 --> 53:17.640]  and a half ago, I said, you know what? I want to lose the next 40 pounds because doctors have told
[53:17.640 --> 53:24.840]  me I need to lose 80 pounds. I have a hernia. It's not a hyenol hernia. It's in my belly button.
[53:24.840 --> 53:28.280]  And they told me they said, you need to lose about 80 pounds. You'll have to have surgery.
[53:29.160 --> 53:33.160]  And I've lost 40. I need to go the rest of the way. So a week and a half ago,
[53:33.160 --> 53:37.640]  I said, you know what? I'm not used to just taking pills all day, taking vitamins all day,
[53:37.640 --> 53:41.560]  drinking drinks all day. Yeah, I do one tangy tangerine, one polymers today,
[53:41.560 --> 53:48.600]  a couple of essential fatty acids. Not now. I'm doing the whole regimen and I've lost seven pounds
[53:48.600 --> 53:53.160]  in a week and a half. I've lost 42. I quit doing it because I've never been in the habit of doing
[53:53.160 --> 53:57.640]  this, gained a few pounds back and now raised seven pounds in a week and a half. We're going to see
[53:57.640 --> 54:02.920]  what happens here with Alex Jones, folks, because I'm fully committing. I'm taking it all. I'm
[54:02.920 --> 54:08.360]  doing it. Now, breaking this down, it's not just the weight loss. It's also energy. It's so many
[54:08.360 --> 54:12.520]  other things. Aaron, it's like this, Alex. Our world's become centralized. The people who have
[54:12.520 --> 54:17.560]  taken over the food supply have tried to give us fillers so they can go for, you know, the greatest
[54:17.560 --> 54:22.680]  number of people being fed these junk foods and everything else. When you take this nutrition,
[54:22.680 --> 54:27.240]  you're giving your body the little codes, the little fats, the little signals it needs.
[54:27.240 --> 54:31.320]  And when the body gets that, it responds to it right away. That's why it works.
[54:31.320 --> 54:35.160]  It's really just feeding it in the formula you need. So then you're not seeking out
[54:35.160 --> 54:40.440]  foods you don't really need. And it makes things like emotional eating a lot less likely as well.
[54:40.440 --> 54:45.160]  And I found pizza cravings and things like that went away when I took the essential fats.
[54:45.160 --> 54:49.560]  When I had the tangy tangerine, you have that base nutrition. So you're not always looking for
[54:49.560 --> 54:54.120]  nutrition in foods where you're really not going to find it anyway in many cases. I think organic
[54:54.120 --> 54:58.920]  foods and stuff like that's really important as well. But this was a total transformation when
[54:58.920 --> 55:03.880]  I was already eating organic foods, already trying to work out and already trying to change my life.
[55:03.880 --> 55:11.320]  But this really let it happen. When people actually try this, they are blown away. When they find out
[55:11.320 --> 55:17.160]  that when you start taking their proprietary formulation of essential fatty acids that blows
[55:17.160 --> 55:22.840]  the competition away, when you start taking beyond tangy tangerine and polymers plus and the other
[55:22.840 --> 55:30.360]  key longevity products, it is incredible. But you've got to continue taking it. But the body
[55:31.240 --> 55:36.920]  is so starved for nutrition by design by the globalist. I mean, they've engineered this
[55:36.920 --> 55:42.360]  so that we become these self-propelled stomachs always seeking food because we're looking for the
[55:42.360 --> 55:48.840]  vitamins, the minerals, the trace elements. This has the mighty 90 in it. The human body needs
[55:48.840 --> 55:56.440]  90 vitamins, minerals and trace elements to work in fusion together. And the system knows this.
[55:56.440 --> 56:02.760]  So I challenge you, check out the incredible products at infowarsteam.com, use them. And if you
[56:02.760 --> 56:08.760]  don't see incredible effects, I will be shocked because everyone I talk to who has used these
[56:08.760 --> 56:14.200]  is sold on them. You've seen the effects on Alex Jones. You've seen the effects on Aaron Dykes.
[56:14.200 --> 56:21.320]  The system knows about high nutrient diets. They've done studies where mice and other rodents
[56:21.320 --> 56:28.840]  can live twice as long or even longer in some cases when they're given super high nutrient diets.
[56:29.640 --> 56:35.320]  But it is not available in most of the foods out there. We've actually been lied to for decades
[56:35.320 --> 56:40.440]  in our lives, maybe our whole lifetimes for a lot of people because we're told to eat a certain way.
[56:40.440 --> 56:45.720]  We're convinced by television and other advertisements of how to live our life. It's all wrong.
[56:45.720 --> 56:50.040]  And when you just read about the nutrition, you realize how powerful it is. You realize this is
[56:50.040 --> 56:54.920]  what we're meant to take. That's the stuff you find in tangy tangerine and young Jevvie products.
[56:54.920 --> 57:00.440]  And it was so easy. That's the most incredible part. It was so easy to lose weight and regain
[57:00.440 --> 57:05.720]  health for myself barely without trying just for taking the products. We're here promoting what
[57:05.720 --> 57:10.840]  we believe in, what we've seen great results with to you. I want to challenge our radio
[57:10.840 --> 57:16.600]  listeners to go to infowarseteam.com and watch this video so you can see for yourselves the
[57:16.600 --> 57:22.920]  incredible results Aaron and others have achieved with the young Jevvie products that are discounted
[57:22.920 --> 57:30.280]  at wholesale prices at infowarseteam.com. Again, sign up as a distributor and get wholesale pricing
[57:30.280 --> 57:36.840]  discounts at infowarseteam.com. The revolution against tyranny starts individually with our
[57:36.840 --> 57:43.240]  bodies. There is a global awakening happening. The sleeping giant that is humanity is awakening.
[57:43.240 --> 57:58.120]  And a big part of that fight starts at infowarseteam.com. Sick of the globalist eugenesis control freaks
[57:58.120 --> 58:02.840]  adding poison to your water and laughing as you get sick and die? Start purifying your water

[59:52.360 --> 1:00:14.360]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:38.360]  And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:00:43.960 --> 1:00:48.120]  Coming up on the other side of this break, we're going to be joined by Doug Hagman of
[1:00:48.120 --> 1:00:54.760]  the Northeast Intelligence Network and his homeland security source, federal law enforcement level,
[1:00:55.320 --> 1:01:00.840]  said that they've been told something big in late October, early November, probably a false flag.
[1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:04.360]  And they said early on, it looked like they were trying to start a race war. We know the
[1:01:04.360 --> 1:01:09.080]  White House has been caught doing that. That failed, though, with the whole Trayvon Martin thing,
[1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:13.880]  as the truth came out. I'm sad they used that poor young man's death to try to get it going.
[1:01:13.880 --> 1:01:20.200]  But the article is up at infowars.com and prisonplot.com and the featured news area,
[1:01:20.200 --> 1:01:25.720]  DHS source. It's going hot. Obama false flag coming. I believe this can be stopped.
[1:01:25.720 --> 1:01:32.520]  And I've listened to Hagman for years when he's on syndicated radio shows and TV. I followed him.
[1:01:34.200 --> 1:01:38.600]  What his source is giving him fits the MOI have. And I think Hagman's a good guy.
[1:01:38.600 --> 1:01:48.200]  I am not saying that there is going to be a big false flag, but you better know.
[1:01:49.480 --> 1:01:55.640]  You better understand that if we don't talk about it and if we don't expose it,
[1:01:55.640 --> 1:02:01.480]  the likelihood of it is amplified. I mean, we had that guest on who it turned out was a famous TV
[1:02:01.480 --> 1:02:09.800]  presenter producer. We knew who he was. But it came out in the news that he had infiltrated,
[1:02:09.800 --> 1:02:13.240]  gotten a security job at the Olympics, and they were teaching him that there would be a terror
[1:02:13.240 --> 1:02:17.560]  attack. And I said at the time, that doesn't mean there's going to be one. They do that to gauge
[1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:23.240]  people and hype up fear. But there could have been an event if we hadn't exposed it. I mean,
[1:02:23.240 --> 1:02:29.720]  the British government with MI6 asset, a SWAT, did stage 7-7. That even came out on
[1:02:29.720 --> 1:02:36.440]  Associated Press Fox News. Former Justice Department official Loftus, John Loftus went public with that.
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:42.120]  And that came out on the London Telegraph. But this is always months after something that comes
[1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:46.920]  out. So governments got the underwear bomber on the plane, the shoe bomber on the plane.
[1:02:46.920 --> 1:02:53.080]  That all came out on C-SPAN and congressional testimony. All of this is very, very real.
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:58.040]  And all of this is a real threat. And you've got all these White House advisors, I just played
[1:02:58.040 --> 1:03:03.160]  you clips of them talking about it. Even on hardball, a mass shooting will help us connect.
[1:03:03.160 --> 1:03:08.760]  A huge terror attack will help the president connect. Oklahoma City got Bill Clinton re-elected.
[1:03:08.760 --> 1:03:13.480]  We need another one. Don't worry, fundraisers. It looks like Obama's down. There's going to
[1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:17.640]  be an event. We're going to blame it on our animation. I mean, this is so transparent.
[1:03:18.840 --> 1:03:24.920]  We would be insane. I'm going to recap this when we come back. It's so important. We would be insane
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:28.840]  to not be looking at this. So I'm going to send that 15-minute video out because it's already
[1:03:28.840 --> 1:03:32.360]  out there. You're about to hear more, an in-depth interview with Doug Hagman. And I'm going to
[1:03:32.360 --> 1:03:38.040]  send that interview out at Real Alex Jones there on Twitter. Real Alex Jones, again,
[1:03:38.040 --> 1:03:43.000]  is twitter.com forward slash realalexjones. You can also go to infowars.com and click on the
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.440]  social media link and find our links to our official Facebook, our Twitter, all of it there
[1:03:48.440 --> 1:03:53.880]  at infowars.com and prismpana.com. But if you're not following us there on Twitter during this
[1:03:53.880 --> 1:04:00.600]  break, I am going to send the link out via my little government tracking device here
[1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:05.480]  to everyone because it is so incredibly important. In fact, people show a document
[1:04:05.480 --> 1:04:15.160]  cam shot right here. If you're watching on prismplanet.tv, I am going to go to the link.
[1:04:17.880 --> 1:04:21.960]  Has it already rolled off the front page? I want to make sure that's put back on
[1:04:21.960 --> 1:04:26.600]  the front page of that interview that we did last night. It's already scrolled off into the
[1:04:26.600 --> 1:04:31.800]  breaking news link. You want to go to the breaking news link or the top stories link. We'll also
[1:04:31.800 --> 1:04:39.960]  take you there to find that link for everybody. If you go to top stories, it's probably the best
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:46.040]  place to find that. And that's where all the featured news that scrolls off goes. But we're
[1:04:46.040 --> 1:04:52.520]  going to get that out to everybody. There it is, DHS source. It's going hot. Obama false flag coming.
[1:04:53.240 --> 1:04:57.720]  I'm going to take that video and text. I'm going to send it out on my Twitter right now,
[1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:03.000]  real Alex Jones there. You can shine up by going to the icon for Twitter right there
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:10.040]  and visiting that. The worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks
[1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:15.080]  the hottest half year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions.
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:19.320]  Not only corn, but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted,
[1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:23.880]  raising prices. The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business,
[1:05:23.880 --> 1:05:28.920]  blowing up your food prices. The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food costs to
[1:05:28.920 --> 1:05:33.720]  today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods direct now. As the price of
[1:05:33.720 --> 1:05:38.120]  raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your
[1:05:38.120 --> 1:05:42.760]  supply. I recently increased my supply from eFoods direct because we've all known this was coming.
[1:05:42.760 --> 1:05:47.560]  You know about their delicious long term storeable foods. The fact is you can eat at any time to
[1:05:47.560 --> 1:05:51.960]  save money today and because it stores for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding
[1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:58.920]  the rising food cost. Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[1:05:58.920 --> 1:06:14.840]  Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. You can bet your life on eFoods direct.
[1:06:14.840 --> 1:06:30.760]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:49.400]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to another hour of resistance to tyranny. I am your host, Alex Jones.
[1:06:49.400 --> 1:06:54.360]  We're here Monday through Friday, 12 noon to 3 p.m. Eastern. And of course, back Sundays,
[1:06:54.360 --> 1:07:03.080]  4 to 6 central, 5 to 7 Eastern. Also blasting out on XM 166 and over 115 AM and FM stations.
[1:07:03.080 --> 1:07:09.240]  I am Alex Jones coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, the capital city of Texas, Austin.
[1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:16.280]  Now, if you just joined us earlier, I was breaking down in plain clips of Michael Savage,
[1:07:16.280 --> 1:07:21.560]  the talk show host, saying he believes Obama will stage a terror attack before the election
[1:07:21.560 --> 1:07:27.880]  to stay in power. We played a clip of Glenn Beck that didn't get any national news when he did it,
[1:07:27.880 --> 1:07:32.360]  saying Obama will stage terror attacks to get reelected or his handlers will.
[1:07:33.160 --> 1:07:35.720]  That didn't get attention because they don't want to attack him on that.
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:39.640]  Come out to attack Dave Mustaine at first for saying, hey, they stage fast and furious.
[1:07:39.640 --> 1:07:43.080]  They could be staging these. When he didn't apologize, they dropped it.
[1:07:45.560 --> 1:07:51.080]  Because they don't want to go there. You have four different White House advisors sending out letters
[1:07:51.080 --> 1:07:56.280]  to fundraisers, but also letters to sponsors and in the Financial Times of London saying,
[1:07:56.280 --> 1:08:02.920]  if we have a terror attack, it can be blamed on our enemies. Now, they don't say they're
[1:08:02.920 --> 1:08:08.360]  going to do it. They say, without an Oklahoma City, without a 9-11, Robert Shapiro, I read the
[1:08:08.360 --> 1:08:14.440]  quotes last hour, we just joined us, said, we need a terror attack or Obama won't get a reelected.
[1:08:14.440 --> 1:08:17.320]  If you don't believe me, just type it into a search engine. If you just joined us,
[1:08:17.320 --> 1:08:21.240]  I know there's listeners joining us every minute. Just type in. In fact, let's do it on Google in
[1:08:21.240 --> 1:08:25.880]  front of everybody. There's my Twitter on screen. If you're watching on prisonplanet.tv,
[1:08:25.880 --> 1:08:30.920]  Obama gives stage terror green light. Now, that doesn't mean we can't put the light back on red,
[1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:36.840]  but that's what Mr. Hagman's sources are saying. That's what my sources are saying.
[1:08:36.840 --> 1:08:43.320]  That's why we're about to get into all of this. So this information is in everyone's face.
[1:08:43.320 --> 1:08:48.920]  And all you got to do is type into the NSA search engine, Google. Obama advisors
[1:08:50.040 --> 1:08:56.200]  say false flag will get Obama reelected. And you will get, not just info wars.com, you'll get
[1:08:57.640 --> 1:09:03.080]  Financial Times of London. You'll get hardball. I mean, I just put the clip of them on hardball
[1:09:03.080 --> 1:09:08.120]  saying a shooting will help the president reconnect. That was a year ago. They constantly
[1:09:08.120 --> 1:09:13.800]  say it. There's so many instances of it. They say this like we're idiots. They say this like we're
[1:09:13.800 --> 1:09:18.520]  morons. And then the media every once in a while will attack those of us that point out their
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:22.440]  saying it. It's like, Hey, here's the elephant sitting on us in the living room. These guys have
[1:09:22.440 --> 1:09:28.280]  a pension. They got caught in fast and furious staging a false flag. Take Larry Pratt. He was on
[1:09:28.280 --> 1:09:31.720]  my show right after those shootings happened. He said, Alex, I used to think you were wrong, but
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:35.240]  they got caught in a false flag of the fast and furious. So we've got to look at these being
[1:09:35.240 --> 1:09:40.120]  staged and witnesses say multiple shooters in both events. Of course, they're staging it.
[1:09:41.800 --> 1:09:46.440]  I mean, they'll stage other events. They've got the motive, the timing, the UN treaty. They're
[1:09:46.440 --> 1:09:52.920]  doing it. I'm not up here risking my life for nothing. I want freedom in my time, not just for
[1:09:52.920 --> 1:09:59.880]  my children. I was offered 12 years ago and 10 years ago and eight years ago, big national shows.
[1:09:59.880 --> 1:10:06.920]  If I would just cool all this, I could have been the big neocon queen like Glenn Beck.
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:13.240]  And I'm not attacking Glenn Beck. The point is, is that Darth Vader was good as well. I think
[1:10:13.240 --> 1:10:19.080]  he actually has woke up some. That's why they're trying to push him off the air. The issue here
[1:10:19.080 --> 1:10:24.600]  is that there's good still in most of us and we decide which angels we're going to follow.
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:30.440]  Our lesser angels are the angels of God. We've got to decide if we're for good or for evil.
[1:10:32.280 --> 1:10:35.880]  There's two different things in this world. There's good and there's bad. And which side
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:44.120]  do you choose? Well, I choose good. Judge Schmelz would say good, very good, because I've got to
[1:10:44.120 --> 1:10:48.920]  throw Caddyshack in there because, I mean, you're only alive once, ladies and gentlemen. So I don't
[1:10:48.920 --> 1:10:54.520]  get up here and say all of this because it's fun. I don't get up here when I get death threats and
[1:10:54.520 --> 1:11:01.720]  physically attacked and IRS harassment and all the rest of it because I just want to have fun and
[1:11:01.720 --> 1:11:05.880]  scare the daylights out of people. I have to say so many guests years ago that I thought were too
