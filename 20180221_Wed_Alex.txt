[00:00.000 --> 00:12.640]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[00:12.640 --> 00:15.400]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:15.400 --> 00:27.200]  Hello, and welcome to the Alex Jones show.
[00:27.200 --> 00:32.960]  If you're wondering why the dulcet tones of a well-dressed, well-educated Englishman
[00:32.960 --> 00:38.400]  are coming to you today, that's because our fearless leader is out elsewhere in the world
[00:38.400 --> 00:43.400]  doing whatever it is that international men of mystery get up to.
[00:43.400 --> 00:48.400]  I am Miley Annopoulos standing in for Alex Jones for the next two hours.
[00:48.400 --> 00:52.040]  Alex will be back himself for the third hour of the show today, and the fourth hour of
[00:52.040 --> 00:57.160]  the show will be the one and only Roger Stone.
[00:57.160 --> 01:03.040]  I'm Miley, the host of the Miley show, and you can go to dangerous.com to read my journalism
[01:03.040 --> 01:04.120]  and find out my stuff.
[01:04.120 --> 01:12.680]  I have my own show, so you can go if by some strange and improbable chance, four hours of
[01:12.680 --> 01:15.720]  info wars a day isn't enough for you, go and check out the Miley show.
[01:15.720 --> 01:18.520]  You can go to dangerous.com slash join.
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.680]  Coming up today on the show, breaking news in Florida from Alex himself, he's going
[01:23.680 --> 01:27.120]  to be talking you through that in the third hour.
[01:27.120 --> 01:31.760]  We've got interviews with our reporter Laura Luma who is on the ground ferreting out the
[01:31.760 --> 01:38.280]  latest developments, including another doorstop of the sheriff, news about tech, crumbling
[01:38.280 --> 01:40.960]  tech empires.
[01:40.960 --> 01:51.080]  The left's peculiar interference running and damage control as it emerges that there is
[01:51.080 --> 01:55.440]  something up with these child's spokespeople.
[01:55.440 --> 02:01.200]  But before we get to all of that, a story about aid workers, and this was in The Independent.
[02:01.200 --> 02:02.680]  This is a special report.
[02:02.680 --> 02:06.000]  Aids workers aren't saints, and they can go bad.
[02:06.000 --> 02:11.120]  I know because I did, well, it's putting it mildly.
[02:11.120 --> 02:19.400]  The truth is that the majority of aid workers are morally compromised at best.
[02:19.400 --> 02:28.960]  And many, let's just say it, many aid workers are really terrible people.
[02:28.960 --> 02:35.400]  If you think about the sense of moral self-righteousness that most people who work in the left wing
[02:35.400 --> 02:40.360]  charitable sector have, by aid workers, we're not talking about people who work with veterans,
[02:40.360 --> 02:46.880]  people who are doing noble things to preserve freedoms, and to look after people who are
[02:46.880 --> 02:49.200]  underprivileged or whatnot.
[02:49.200 --> 02:54.440]  We're talking about people who work in the corporatized, globalist, professionalized
[02:54.440 --> 03:03.600]  charitable sector, people who are invariably and almost without exception signed up to
[03:03.600 --> 03:09.760]  an anti-free speech, anti-straight white male, anti-capitalist, anti-nation state,
[03:09.760 --> 03:13.360]  anti-border, anti-freedom agenda.
[03:13.360 --> 03:20.920]  These people sign up entirely to the extraordinary bonkers beliefs of the sorts of people who
[03:20.920 --> 03:22.920]  work at the United Nations.
[03:22.920 --> 03:27.840]  But it's even worse for people who are out there working on the field, UN workers, for
[03:27.840 --> 03:31.600]  instance, because they operate internationally with almost no checks and balances on their
[03:31.600 --> 03:32.600]  behavior.
[03:32.600 --> 03:35.040]  They include sex, guns, and drugs.
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.520]  These people are running riot all over the world in supposedly impoverished and terrible
[03:39.520 --> 03:44.160]  places, painting their own wrongdoing as the product of stress.
[03:44.160 --> 03:49.000]  This author in The Independent, which is a left-wing British publication, says, there's
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.800]  a third category of aid worker, the good one that turns bad.
[03:53.800 --> 03:58.640]  He says that aid working is like being a junkie on adrenaline.
[03:58.640 --> 04:05.760]  The stress gets to you and you start to sink into drugs, sex, lots and lots of sex, he
[04:05.760 --> 04:06.760]  says.
[04:06.760 --> 04:12.000]  Hence the book, Emergency Sex and Other Desperate Measures, excuse making by liberals for their
[04:12.000 --> 04:14.360]  bad behavior and war-torn zones.
[04:14.360 --> 04:16.640]  Now we're starting to see this stuff come out.
[04:16.640 --> 04:20.840]  Oxfam is getting in the neck for the Haitian prostitute scandal, but this is just the tip
[04:20.840 --> 04:21.840]  of the iceberg.
[04:21.840 --> 04:26.320]  And the way that I know that, the reason I can tell you with such certainty and confidence,
[04:26.320 --> 04:30.440]  is that I used to work, and a lot of people know this, I used to work as a chief researcher
[04:30.440 --> 04:33.560]  and speech writer for a climate change NGO.
[04:33.560 --> 04:37.560]  These people are truly dreadful, and I'm glad to see them getting their comeuppance.
[04:37.560 --> 04:41.840]  Aid workers by and large are awful people, and you shouldn't feel in the slightest bit
[04:41.840 --> 04:47.480]  bad about Oxfam and these other globalized, massively wealthy charities crumbling, crashing,
[04:47.480 --> 04:49.840]  and burning in flames.
[04:49.840 --> 04:53.480]  And with that cheerful start to the day, my name is Milo, and this is InfoWars.
[04:53.480 --> 04:58.080]  We're going to be right back after this break with Florida Intrigue.
[04:58.080 --> 05:27.480]  See you in a second.
[05:58.080 --> 06:20.040]  We've got it, we've got it, got it.
[06:20.040 --> 06:28.480]  My fellow Info Warriors Billy Graham at 99 has died and Billy Graham wasn't hardcore enough
[06:28.480 --> 06:35.200]  for a lot of Christians out there but throughout the last 65 years going back all the way to
[06:35.200 --> 06:44.600]  Harry Truman, Billy Graham helped hold the line in many respects against modern globalist
[06:44.600 --> 06:50.920]  teachings and the whole ecumenical movement that was attempting to destroy the core principles
[06:50.920 --> 06:57.080]  of Christianity and looking back without people like Billy Graham we wouldn't even have the
[06:57.080 --> 07:02.920]  foundation we have today to fight back against Hollywood and those that would remove any
[07:02.920 --> 07:08.160]  Christian values that we have so that they can replace it with their whole globalist
[07:08.160 --> 07:09.160]  orthodoxy.
[07:09.160 --> 07:15.280]  That said there's a story on InfoWars.com today that ties into this how to Purdue University
[07:15.280 --> 07:22.000]  one of the most prestigious universities obviously not just in the US but in the world known
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.200]  for its academic freedom and excellence for over a hundred years, Purdue has put out their
[07:28.200 --> 07:36.760]  official reader their official guidebook for writing in the English department and for
[07:36.760 --> 07:42.440]  students called the owl they've been putting it out again for decades and it says do not
[07:42.440 --> 07:50.320]  use the word man because man is masculine, man is bad, man is associated with bad things.
[07:50.320 --> 07:54.880]  So again this whole political correctness thing is about ending normal humanity as we
[07:54.880 --> 08:01.840]  know it ending the normal human compact, ending the normal biological system and taking humanity
[08:01.840 --> 08:07.960]  beyond domestication into a level of absolute total social control.
[08:07.960 --> 08:13.560]  The so-called left is not the left they are the most authoritarian cult like fascist group
[08:13.560 --> 08:22.720]  assaulting language, assaulting communications, assaulting all the basic foundations of humanity
[08:22.720 --> 08:29.960]  because in their own words it is a corporate, technotronic, technocracy takeover.
[08:29.960 --> 08:36.560]  Type in in defensive technocracy you'll get Bloomberg, AP Reuters, the Financial Times,
[08:36.560 --> 08:42.720]  all the establishment publications saying we are a technocracy, we are a technological
[08:42.720 --> 08:50.280]  takeover by an authoritarian group that is going to program the general public exactly
[08:50.280 --> 08:52.240]  as we see fit.
[08:52.240 --> 08:56.880]  Now think about that, think about that, make it some moves here in traffic as I record
[08:56.880 --> 09:03.160]  this voice from them for transmission today when Milo's co-hosting I'll be coming on
[09:03.160 --> 09:04.160]  later.
[09:04.160 --> 09:08.480]  Take care of a lot of critical infrastructure and preparations for massive expansion in
[09:08.480 --> 09:10.200]  the face of the NWO.
[09:10.200 --> 09:14.560]  We've promised this each time and expanded massively and had devastating effects against
[09:14.560 --> 09:19.360]  the enemy and I'm telling you now we're about to make our biggest expansion ever in the
[09:19.360 --> 09:25.720]  face of massive censorship and attacks but getting back to Billy Graham.
[09:25.720 --> 09:30.560]  People would think six, seven years ago when I covered articles about elementary students
[09:30.560 --> 09:35.520]  in the U.K. being told that they're purple penguins that you can't be a boy or a girl
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.840]  people thought that was a joke and then a year later it was in the U.S. and then a few
[09:38.840 --> 09:43.160]  years later it was all across the United States and then they would tell parents on
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.760]  entrance form for kindergartners or head start don't call yourself mother or father that
[09:47.760 --> 09:50.400]  could be hurtful that someone else that doesn't.
[09:50.400 --> 09:56.640]  Now you think about that from an authoritarian perspective of a fictitious 1984 or even
[09:56.640 --> 10:02.400]  in 1984 they could use the words mother and father and men and women still have relationships
[10:02.400 --> 10:10.160]  but Orwell in his fictional futurist dystopia projects that they would finally get rid of
[10:10.160 --> 10:13.640]  the family itself because it was in competition with the state.
[10:13.640 --> 10:20.000]  And that's why they're getting rid of God because God can be your image, your idea of
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.080]  a higher power even if you don't believe in a real God.
[10:24.080 --> 10:30.640]  And that gets in the way of the social engineers whose God is political correctness, is racial
[10:30.640 --> 10:37.400]  division, is racial identity to the point that people are basically basket cases who
[10:37.400 --> 10:45.120]  don't know any real social interaction information, any real business information, any real charm,
[10:45.120 --> 10:50.840]  any real destiny, any real success and instead are just experts on fighting with each other
[10:50.840 --> 10:53.320]  and acting like ninny in basket cases.
[10:53.320 --> 11:01.240]  So we can sit there and look at the strictures of conservatives and of Christians and their
[11:01.240 --> 11:07.040]  warnings of what would happen if the nuclear family broke down and their warnings of the
[11:07.040 --> 11:15.360]  disintegration of society and think well that's a form of control, that's a form of manipulation
[11:15.360 --> 11:17.520]  and so we're rebelling against it.
[11:17.520 --> 11:22.400]  But if you look at what happened in the 60s and 70s and 80s the CIA and others declassified
[11:22.400 --> 11:28.600]  the fact that is leftist inside those organizations admitted that they were seeking to overthrow
[11:28.600 --> 11:35.920]  the entire existing order and replace it with something infinitely more centralized, autocratic
[11:35.920 --> 11:39.720]  and authoritarian and so that's a fact.
[11:39.720 --> 11:46.320]  There is an absolute war on what they call the bourgeois, the middle class, the upwardly
[11:46.320 --> 11:54.640]  mobile and it's by the elite itself that wants to eradicate any cultures, any systems
[11:54.640 --> 11:57.200]  that it doesn't totally control.
[11:57.200 --> 12:05.280]  And so yes it's easy to take on the so-called pseudo-intellectual garment of individuals
[12:05.280 --> 12:10.080]  that roll their eyes at preachers and people that warn about the destruction of the family.
[12:10.080 --> 12:17.520]  But now the facts are in 100% in triplicate that we indeed have seen they break down in
[12:17.520 --> 12:23.440]  civilization due to the breakdown of the family with the ongoing assault and even those that
[12:23.440 --> 12:30.240]  still carry out a system of stability and success and competency do it somewhat secretly
[12:30.240 --> 12:38.480]  and unreveal as if we are committing some type of dirty, heretical action.
[12:38.480 --> 12:41.200]  It was the West that was open for women to vote.
[12:41.200 --> 12:46.480]  It was the West that was open to decriminalize same-sex activities.
[12:46.480 --> 12:54.960]  It was the West that was the trailblazer in true equality, in true open societies, in
[12:54.960 --> 13:02.200]  true live and let live philosophy.
[13:02.200 --> 13:08.080]  But just because you live and let live, just because you're tolerant, does it mean that
[13:08.080 --> 13:14.600]  you give up your basic operating system because just the mere existence of capitalism or the
[13:14.600 --> 13:24.000]  mere existence of European or Western values because the mere existence of it in museums
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.880]  affronts the globalist because it can't be allowed to stand because an open, free, true
[13:29.880 --> 13:38.680]  renaissance society is so much sexier and so much cooler than the modern globalist
[13:38.680 --> 13:43.760]  technocracy, which is really just an ancient system of cult-like control with a high-tech
[13:43.760 --> 13:49.160]  overlay and high-tech digital straitjacket to control.
[13:49.160 --> 13:56.720]  So that said, the old Western values would criticize and warn about broken families and
[13:56.720 --> 14:01.360]  warn about cheating on your wife, not from some hypocritical perspective, but because
[14:01.360 --> 14:07.200]  they knew they'd done it and they'd come out of the dark age and out of true barbarism.
[14:07.200 --> 14:12.320]  And so now look at where we are today, where it's not about equality, it's about the people
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.840]  that have put themselves into these new subgroups, now announcing themselves the dominant culture
[14:17.840 --> 14:22.400]  and the new religion and telling all of us that we must comply or we'll be banned from
[14:22.400 --> 14:28.120]  the Internet, we'll be ostracized, we'll be censored, we'll be persecuted, we'll be
[14:28.120 --> 14:33.520]  hit in the head with a bike lock, you see signs up saying kill the NRA members, major
[14:33.520 --> 14:38.520]  billboards still not taken down, left to saying abort your babies so they don't die in mass
[14:38.520 --> 14:47.360]  shootings, just open calls for violence everywhere, you see what happens when strong cultures
[14:47.360 --> 14:56.640]  they are seen as too dominant, too successful, too sexy, commit suicide, hoping it makes
[14:56.640 --> 15:03.760]  other systems feel more at home, that is the essence of being a cuck, that is the essence
[15:03.760 --> 15:09.840]  of cultural suicide and you see that into that vacuum comes the technocrats then directing
[15:09.840 --> 15:16.720]  the most barbarous and racist and dumb down and most controlling elements of all the different
[15:16.720 --> 15:21.520]  disparate groups where the globalists have colonized the third world, enslaved it, weaponized
[15:21.520 --> 15:26.320]  it, dumbed it down and are now in movies like Black Panther saying it's time for the third
[15:26.320 --> 15:31.320]  world to come in and then colonize what's left of the West but in truth they're not
[15:31.320 --> 15:34.560]  really going to be colonizing what's left of the West, they're just going to be making
[15:34.560 --> 15:39.280]  sure that anything that could ever allow freedom to spring again or true diversity to spring
[15:39.280 --> 15:43.480]  again or true renaissance to spring again or true free market to spring again will be
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.760]  dynamited and will be destroyed, all right back to the live transmission and the one

[18:58.280 --> 19:00.160]  Available at InfowarsLife.com.
[19:00.160 --> 19:06.520]  I want to plow into all of this, but I'm going to spend a few minutes here first just encouraging
[19:06.520 --> 19:12.920]  listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[19:12.920 --> 19:20.160]  or videos or other material from InfowarsStore.com, you are funding the revolution.
[19:20.160 --> 19:25.080]  I mean I cannot say it any clearer and so it is essential that you purchase the products
[19:25.080 --> 19:26.080]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[19:26.080 --> 19:29.720]  I don't want to thank everybody that has, but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste
[19:29.720 --> 19:33.600]  with colloidal silver and with high quality atomic iodine in it.
[19:33.600 --> 19:36.000]  You cannot beat that for children and adults.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.120]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones, that's my dad, with colloidal silver
[19:40.120 --> 19:47.920]  and iodine as well, InfowarsLife.com or AAA-253-3139 and your purchase of the products stands
[19:47.920 --> 19:51.480]  with us, stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their
[19:51.480 --> 19:55.720]  satanic pedophile armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and
[19:55.720 --> 20:04.120]  they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[20:04.120 --> 20:30.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.680 --> 20:42.120]  Welcome back before the break.
[20:42.120 --> 20:48.920]  You heard the dear leader, one pastor giving his eulogy to another.
[20:48.920 --> 20:52.840]  Now we're going to move on to the two things biggest in my mind today.
[20:52.840 --> 21:04.560]  First of all, the unfurling scandal surrounding aid charities, Oxfam is embroiled in controversy
[21:04.560 --> 21:09.880]  at the moment because of its prostitution activities in Haiti.
[21:09.880 --> 21:14.360]  But let me tell you, that's just the tip of the iceberg.
[21:14.360 --> 21:17.320]  Let us be clear, aid workers are terrible people.
[21:17.320 --> 21:28.720]  This is not the giving self-sacrifice of a church parishioner who hops in on Sundays
[21:28.720 --> 21:32.920]  to help out people who cannot feed themselves properly.
[21:32.920 --> 21:42.600]  Aid workers in countries like Rwanda and Bosnia and Haiti are rich, entitled white liberals
[21:42.600 --> 21:49.600]  out there spreading the gospel of climate change with a bent knee to the citadel of globalism.
[21:49.600 --> 21:55.960]  These are not heroes, these are people whose moral and ethical systems are heavily and
[21:55.960 --> 22:04.400]  irredeemably compromised by the terrible people they work around for and with.
[22:04.400 --> 22:11.960]  And it shouldn't surprise us that this unfurling tragedy is starting to tarnish the reputations
[22:11.960 --> 22:16.640]  of organizations that had previously been unscathed by critique and it took the Mitu
[22:16.640 --> 22:18.320]  movement to do it.
[22:18.320 --> 22:22.440]  I worked for a climate change NGO, which I don't like to tell people very often because
[22:22.440 --> 22:27.880]  it is not a particularly bright spot on my resume, but I was chief researcher and speechwriter
[22:27.880 --> 22:37.240]  for a climate change NGO, one of the member organizations of this vast parasitic bureaucracy
[22:37.240 --> 22:45.520]  that orbits the UN, and I saw firsthand how the IPCC cooks the books, makes up the numbers.
[22:45.520 --> 22:51.360]  I saw it with my own eyes, I saw people changing numbers from studies to better fit political
[22:51.360 --> 22:53.480]  priorities in hysterical language.
[22:53.480 --> 23:00.200]  I saw executive summaries being ginned up to be as hysterical as possible.
[23:00.200 --> 23:05.640]  And in my time there, I spent a lot of work trips with people who did the kind of work
[23:05.640 --> 23:09.880]  that Oxfam and other charities do in war-torn areas.
[23:09.880 --> 23:14.720]  Their lives may superficially be dedicated to the betterment of others and to the advancement
[23:14.720 --> 23:23.040]  of medicine and peace, but their lives are saturated not just with drugs and with sex,
[23:23.040 --> 23:28.520]  which they excuse by saying they're under so much stress, but also with guns.
[23:28.520 --> 23:33.880]  These people operate internationally and out of the reach of the rule of law, running
[23:33.880 --> 23:42.040]  shotgun with armies from both sides in some cases of conflicts, throwing themselves around
[23:42.040 --> 23:49.160]  some of the most exciting and beautiful places on Earth, drenched in drugs, sex and guns,
[23:49.160 --> 23:52.800]  whining about how stressed they are and how really, you know, if only you knew how awful
[23:52.800 --> 23:59.440]  it was working for a rich multinational globalist NGO, spending time in the most beautiful places
[23:59.440 --> 24:00.440]  on planet Earth.
[24:00.440 --> 24:03.960]  I understand why I had to hire prostitutes, give me a break.
[24:03.960 --> 24:09.760]  The other new story that is consuming the week is, of course, Florida, and the left
[24:09.760 --> 24:17.360]  is not enjoying very much being caught out on its little canal, these poor innocent students.
[24:17.360 --> 24:23.960]  Let's show two tweets from one of the students that purport to represent the opinion of one
[24:23.960 --> 24:25.600]  of the kids caught in Florida.
[24:25.600 --> 24:30.360]  Now look, it's not a polite thing to say, it's not a very family-friendly thing to say,
[24:30.360 --> 24:35.000]  it's the sort of thing that makes people very upset at you, but it is unarguably true that
[24:35.000 --> 24:38.880]  there is something up with the testimony of these kids on TV.
[24:38.880 --> 24:44.600]  We saw this Douglas Hogg kid give beautifully rehearsed lines one day, stumble on another
[24:44.600 --> 24:45.600]  day.
[24:45.600 --> 24:49.800]  We saw a video of him from California, some confected nonsense up there where he was
[24:49.800 --> 24:51.600]  presumably practicing for prime time.
[24:51.600 --> 24:55.880]  There's something up with the testimony from these kids, and we've got two tweets, one
[24:55.880 --> 25:03.240]  of them as the kids, their minders and TV networks run damage control with Douglas Hogg
[25:03.240 --> 25:10.600]  and his FBI dad on CNN, with Anderson Cooper, who never met a story he didn't cry at, desperately
[25:10.600 --> 25:15.800]  entreating America to set aside the conspiracy theories.
[25:15.800 --> 25:19.000]  But look for your own eyes, there's something weird about this, if we could throw these
[25:19.000 --> 25:25.280]  two tweets up from this girl, screeching, we are kids, we are kids.
[25:25.280 --> 25:33.800]  And look at her, yeah there it is, this is very odd to me, if you look at the Twitter
[25:33.800 --> 25:37.200]  stream of this particular girl, there is something up with it, there's another tweet
[25:37.200 --> 25:41.160]  where she says, I just started organizing this march and I didn't even know anyone was
[25:41.160 --> 25:45.960]  going to show up and now everyone around the world is watching, this is like a middle-aged
[25:45.960 --> 25:52.240]  social justice warriors idea of what a kid might say, of how to touch the hearts of millions
[25:52.240 --> 26:00.720]  with the intrepid and brave stories of these courageous children.
[26:00.720 --> 26:04.320]  But there's something up here, and we're going to find out what it is, and the way
[26:04.320 --> 26:08.160]  you know that is the networks, I mentioned on the show yesterday, the way you know that
[26:08.160 --> 26:12.720]  there is something up is that the networks and the newspapers are so hysterically trying
[26:12.720 --> 26:19.640]  to shut it down, ridiculing and badgering anybody who dares to mention it, CNN reports.
[26:19.640 --> 26:25.280]  If you ever want to really annoy yourself, go and take a look at CNN's report, the written
[26:25.280 --> 26:31.720]  reporting on CNN.com and look at the adjectives, they're so desperate, the false reports from
[26:31.720 --> 26:36.200]  these shameful such and such, this isn't news reporting, it's opinion writing masquerading
[26:36.200 --> 26:42.600]  as news in the service of CNN's own political agenda.
[26:42.600 --> 26:46.400]  This stuff is being used to push narratives, not just about gun control, but also about
[26:46.400 --> 26:51.160]  video games, now Florida legislators are suggesting, contrary to all evidence and experience that
[26:51.160 --> 26:55.400]  video games can make you violent, so we should look at that, and even pornography, somebody
[26:55.400 --> 27:00.360]  reported that the shooter was playing a lot of video games and there is no evidence whatsoever
[27:00.360 --> 27:02.680]  that video games can make you violent.
[27:02.680 --> 27:06.760]  In fact, there are studies that show that it helps boys to let off steam and they behave
[27:06.760 --> 27:13.520]  more congenially and pleasantly as a people after they've played very competitive games.
[27:13.520 --> 27:19.080]  No evidence for this whatsoever, but this is being used to push a variety of narratives,
[27:19.080 --> 27:23.720]  all of them designed to erode your freedoms, and it's even happening in Arizona.
[27:23.720 --> 27:31.640]  The political indoctrination of young kids by teachers should be a cause for worry for
[27:31.640 --> 27:34.120]  anyone who has children in a public school.
[27:34.120 --> 27:37.160]  Let me read you a letter I got from a fan.
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.600]  She says, Hi Milo, my name is Brianna, I live in Arizona and my brother's high school made
[27:41.600 --> 27:46.840]  an announcement asking students to step outside and protest Trump as well as the NRA and guns.
[27:46.840 --> 27:50.120]  They're pushing for gun control and are using the students to do it.
[27:50.120 --> 27:53.760]  My brother got into an argument with his social studies teacher after he told her he would
[27:53.760 --> 27:55.520]  not be participating in the protest.
[27:55.520 --> 28:02.440]  She then proceeded to tell him if he did not participate that she would fail him.
[28:02.440 --> 28:07.520]  Students are now threatening their kids' educations, their educational futures because they have
[28:07.520 --> 28:15.360]  the wrong opinion about matters that concern their own freedoms because they don't sign
[28:15.360 --> 28:18.880]  up to what CNN and ABC want you to think.
[28:18.880 --> 28:23.520]  And then we've got a clip from NBC which I'd like to play you, which is the worst.
[28:23.520 --> 28:27.680]  Very often reasonable, respectable and kind people on both sides of debate can have different
[28:27.680 --> 28:30.120]  ideas about where the truth is.
[28:30.120 --> 28:36.660]  But after the break, I'm going to play you a clip from NBC crowing about gun owners melting
[28:36.660 --> 28:40.880]  down, smashing up their own guns because I think it gives you a little insight into the
[28:40.880 --> 28:43.080]  psychology of the people who are pushing this stuff.
[28:43.080 --> 28:45.160]  It is deeply, deeply upsetting.
[28:45.160 --> 28:50.360]  NBC crowing and exhibiting the death of American freedoms will be right back after this break
[28:50.360 --> 28:53.360]  and then I'm going to show you this clip from NBC because it's really, really very distressing.
[28:53.360 --> 28:59.920]  We'll be right back.
[28:59.920 --> 29:00.920]  This is Dan Billard.
[29:00.920 --> 29:02.480]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[29:02.480 --> 29:04.040]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[29:04.040 --> 29:06.880]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[29:06.880 --> 29:09.080]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[29:09.080 --> 29:12.880]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[29:12.880 --> 29:13.880]  case.
[29:13.880 --> 29:17.760]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.
[29:17.760 --> 29:21.560]  With the IRS' new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.

[30:06.920 --> 30:10.520]  Playing basketball in the dry summer heat really makes me sweat.

[30:30.200 --> 30:31.800]  and the ball wet.
[30:31.800 --> 30:35.760]  That's why I recommend EmRick's Essentials Fragrance-Free Deodorant.

[31:00.280 --> 31:03.760]  InfowarsLive is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[31:03.760 --> 31:08.400]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[31:08.400 --> 31:13.280]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory
[31:13.280 --> 31:15.320]  health, and normal breathing.
[31:15.320 --> 31:16.320]  This is pollen blood.
[31:16.320 --> 31:21.640]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from
[31:21.640 --> 31:27.840]  specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms by running nose, itchy watery eyes,
[31:27.840 --> 31:29.320]  and excessive mucus production.
[31:29.320 --> 31:34.160]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials.
[31:34.160 --> 31:40.320]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets
[31:40.320 --> 31:45.120]  at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in
[31:45.120 --> 31:48.640]  about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.

[33:03.520 --> 33:17.520]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:17.520 --> 33:19.520]  Big Brother.
[33:19.520 --> 33:22.520]  Mainstream media.
[33:22.520 --> 33:24.520]  Government cover-ups.
[33:24.520 --> 33:26.520]  You want answers?
[33:26.520 --> 33:28.520]  Well, so does he.
[33:28.520 --> 33:35.520]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[33:35.520 --> 33:38.520]  Welcome back.
[33:38.520 --> 33:41.520]  I am Milo, standing in for Alex Jones.
[33:41.520 --> 33:43.520]  I'm on loan from Dangerous.com.
[33:43.520 --> 33:46.520]  You can see my show, the Milo show, Dangerous.com slash join.
[33:46.520 --> 33:57.520]  And I am here live in studio in our pink flushed, slightly gayified Infowars studio, standing in for the big guy.
[33:57.520 --> 34:03.520]  Twitter's head of trust and safety, Del Harvey, is the worst kind of liberal.
[34:03.520 --> 34:06.520]  She's both evil and stupid.
[34:06.520 --> 34:12.520]  Today, trending on Twitter is Twitter lockdown.
[34:12.520 --> 34:18.520]  The latest thing we're doing to conservatives is demanding that we, and by we I mean you,
[34:18.520 --> 34:22.520]  because it's been some time since I've been allowed a Twitter account, as many of you will know,
[34:22.520 --> 34:28.520]  you have to give Twitter your cell phone number to verify your phone number
[34:28.520 --> 34:31.520]  before they will allow you back into your account.
[34:31.520 --> 34:36.520]  This is a number grab by Twitter.
[34:36.520 --> 34:38.520]  What could the motivations be?
[34:38.520 --> 34:46.520]  I don't think that there's some abrupt case in which, you know, conservatives are needing to verify their identities
[34:46.520 --> 34:49.520]  because of ID, what is going on?
[34:49.520 --> 34:57.520]  I believe that the infected hysteria about Russia is being used as a pretext
[34:57.520 --> 35:03.520]  to acquire personal information from accounts that Twitter has identified as being run by conservatives.
[35:03.520 --> 35:07.520]  What Twitter will say is that they have identified Russian bots on the network
[35:07.520 --> 35:12.520]  and therefore they need to verify the identity of accounts that may or may not be compromised
[35:12.520 --> 35:14.520]  and we need to verify that whatever.
[35:14.520 --> 35:22.520]  No, there are plenty of ways to do this without demanding that we hand over our cell phones,
[35:22.520 --> 35:29.520]  our cell phone numbers to Twitter before they allow us to go back on the service,
[35:29.520 --> 35:31.520]  before they allow us to use their service.
[35:31.520 --> 35:36.520]  Now, this comes in the wake of a Vanity Fair report that is brutal about Del Harvey.
[35:36.520 --> 35:40.520]  A very early Twitter employee, she's still with the company, she's been there a really long time
[35:40.520 --> 35:46.520]  and she is, by common consent, grotesquely out of her depth in her current role,
[35:46.520 --> 35:49.520]  which is the troll hunter-in-chief.
[35:49.520 --> 35:59.520]  She's been shat on by, excuse my language, by anonymous sources to Vanity Fair's Maya Kosov,
[35:59.520 --> 36:04.520]  who wrote a story recently which sent shockwaves around Twitter's management.
[36:04.520 --> 36:10.520]  It just revealed what we all knew by the way, which is that Twitter is held together with bubblegum string
[36:10.520 --> 36:12.520]  and bits of old Kleenex boxes.
[36:12.520 --> 36:16.520]  If you read between the lines of this piece in Vanity Fair, you'll see the executives at Twitter
[36:16.520 --> 36:18.520]  don't care that free speech is dead.
[36:18.520 --> 36:21.520]  They don't care about the site lacking basic features.
[36:21.520 --> 36:28.520]  What they care about is punishing conservatives, which is why they have allowed this regime
[36:28.520 --> 36:34.520]  with its notoriously opaque rules and selective enforcement of those rules to run rampant
[36:34.520 --> 36:43.520]  under the gentle guidance of Del Harvey, whom even social justice warriors are getting ticked off with
[36:43.520 --> 36:47.520]  because she doesn't do enough to censor Twitter.
[36:47.520 --> 36:53.520]  Just an ass-backward tech company how Twitter lost the internet war is how Vanity Fair puts it.
[36:53.520 --> 36:58.520]  Some people are saying that Vanity Fair has been fed a load of information by disgruntled executives
[36:58.520 --> 37:03.520]  and she's getting a bad rap, but it doesn't really matter whether it's her
[37:03.520 --> 37:06.520]  or whether it's just a systematic endemic problem in Twitter's culture.
[37:06.520 --> 37:15.520]  What we know for sure is that they are fundamentally, structurally, spiritually hostile to conservatives
[37:15.520 --> 37:19.520]  and libertarians and they are using every excuse possible, not just to censor us,
[37:19.520 --> 37:23.520]  but now with Twitter lockdown to collect private data about us.
[37:23.520 --> 37:26.520]  I don't know how you feel about handing over your cell number to Twitter,
[37:26.520 --> 37:29.520]  but for me it's a hard pass.
[37:29.520 --> 37:35.520]  Facebook co-founder at the same time is warning that tech is going to take all of our jobs.
[37:35.520 --> 37:42.520]  One of the early employees of Facebook, Chris Hughes, who has since recanted, to some extent,
[37:42.520 --> 37:48.520]  warning about the dangers of Facebook interviews, says that the mechanization and digitization
[37:48.520 --> 37:53.520]  and the software eating the world that is being driven in part by social networking companies
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.520]  is not going to let up.
[37:55.520 --> 38:01.520]  It's destroying American jobs, the world of work in America in a terrible threat.
[38:01.520 --> 38:07.520]  And finally on the tech question, YouTube is, of course, owned by Google,
[38:07.520 --> 38:10.520]  notorious for its crackdowns on conservative points of view.
[38:10.520 --> 38:16.520]  And Prager University, run by Dennis Prager, who is a luminary of the Republican conservative movement
[38:16.520 --> 38:19.520]  in this country, does a series of videos on YouTube.
[38:19.520 --> 38:20.520]  They call PragerU.
[38:20.520 --> 38:27.520]  You can go and you can get an education in cultural issues from Dennis Prager and his guests.
[38:27.520 --> 38:31.520]  Well, they touch one of the third rails of the left wing, which is abortion,
[38:31.520 --> 38:37.520]  with the result that YouTube has disabled embedding on the video.
[38:37.520 --> 38:41.520]  So you can't share the video to somebody and have it embedded in a news story.
[38:41.520 --> 38:44.520]  You can't see the video under certain circumstances.
[38:44.520 --> 38:50.520]  It's one of the ways in which Twitter will censor without actually taking the video down.
[38:50.520 --> 38:51.520]  They limit your ability.
[38:51.520 --> 38:55.520]  The whole point of the YouTube platform is that you can share things, is that they spread,
[38:55.520 --> 38:59.520]  is that you can put something down and it'll pop up in the algorithm on related videos.
[38:59.520 --> 39:00.520]  You can share it to people.
[39:00.520 --> 39:02.520]  You can embed it on your blog or in news stories.
[39:02.520 --> 39:08.520]  A really, really devastating thing to do is to limit the sharing and the embedding
[39:08.520 --> 39:12.520]  because it kills people's abilities to share the content,
[39:12.520 --> 39:15.520]  to have that video play out elsewhere on the Internet outside of YouTube site
[39:15.520 --> 39:17.520]  and even for people to find it if they're elsewhere on YouTube.
[39:17.520 --> 39:19.520]  So you don't pop up in the list on the right.
[39:19.520 --> 39:22.520]  I've been in those YouTube cycles.
[39:22.520 --> 39:24.520]  You get locked in just looking at more and more and more things
[39:24.520 --> 39:27.520]  and you don't pop up in any of those lists.
[39:27.520 --> 39:29.520]  So it's death to the video.
[39:29.520 --> 39:31.520]  It's total death to the video.
[39:31.520 --> 39:38.520]  This is the latest wave of YouTube's attempts to censor without censoring
[39:38.520 --> 39:42.520]  and it's all done, of course, in the name of trust and safety.
[39:42.520 --> 39:44.520]  It's for the safety of our users.
[39:44.520 --> 39:46.520]  It's to avoid abuse, spam and harassment.
[39:46.520 --> 39:49.520]  We've been told by users that, give me a break.
[39:49.520 --> 39:59.520]  This is a systematic, deliberate, purposeful, planned and absolutely unacceptable assault
[39:59.520 --> 40:02.520]  on libertarians and conservatives and it is continuing apace.
[40:02.520 --> 40:08.520]  This latest Twitter infraction is just another example.
[40:08.520 --> 40:13.520]  The big argument, really, of the next 10 to 15 years in this country
[40:13.520 --> 40:17.520]  is going to be whether social media companies should be regulated like public utilities.
[40:17.520 --> 40:21.520]  Now, that makes some libertarians and some conservatives feel deeply uncomfortable.
[40:21.520 --> 40:24.520]  It makes us feel awkward.
[40:24.520 --> 40:26.520]  It makes us feel edgy.
[40:26.520 --> 40:28.520]  It's like, no, no, we don't really believe in that.
[40:28.520 --> 40:30.520]  But there are monopolies in every other industry.
[40:30.520 --> 40:33.520]  There are monopolies and there are regulations in every other industry,
[40:33.520 --> 40:35.520]  whether it's oil, whether it's finance, whatever it is.
[40:35.520 --> 40:41.520]  We're perfectly happy to wade in where we think abuses are being perpetrated
[40:41.520 --> 40:44.520]  and give guardrails to capitalism.
[40:44.520 --> 40:46.520]  It's the purpose of state regulation of business.
[40:46.520 --> 40:48.520]  It's just some guardrails.
[40:48.520 --> 40:50.520]  So private enterprises don't go off the rails.
[40:50.520 --> 40:57.520]  Twitter and YouTube and Google Facebook, these companies have such extraordinary control
[40:57.520 --> 40:59.520]  and influence over our lives.
[40:59.520 --> 41:03.520]  And not just that, but influence over our democracy.
[41:03.520 --> 41:06.520]  What happens on Twitter, the stories that appear on Twitter,
[41:06.520 --> 41:10.520]  in large part dictate the stories that journalists are going to write about
[41:10.520 --> 41:13.520]  and how they're going to write about them.
[41:13.520 --> 41:17.520]  Journalists are pack animals and idiots.
[41:17.520 --> 41:20.520]  And it only takes a couple of people expressing an opinion forcefully
[41:20.520 --> 41:25.520]  for it to become the received wisdom in the media.
[41:25.520 --> 41:30.520]  Just a couple of verified liberals on Twitter expressing their views on a contentious subject
[41:30.520 --> 41:32.520]  and the matter is settled.
[41:32.520 --> 41:35.520]  And you'll see that same point of view and even some of the same wording.
[41:35.520 --> 41:41.520]  Pop up in sources as varied as Mike Buzzfeed, The New York Times,
[41:41.520 --> 41:43.520]  and then you'll see it on CNN.
[41:43.520 --> 41:46.520]  And then you'll see it on ABC and NBC and CBS.
[41:46.520 --> 41:47.520]  This is the effect.
[41:47.520 --> 41:50.520]  This is the power that Twitter has over our national discourse,
[41:50.520 --> 41:51.520]  over international discourse.
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.520]  This is the power Twitter has over not just people's right to express themselves
[41:55.520 --> 42:00.520]  and to explore their own opinions, but people's right to be told the truth.
[42:00.520 --> 42:04.520]  This is the power that Twitter has over American democracy
[42:04.520 --> 42:05.520]  and it's abusing that power.
[42:05.520 --> 42:08.520]  It's abusing that power every day and it's doing so deliberately.
[42:08.520 --> 42:12.520]  It has become, thanks to its horrible financial circumstances
[42:12.520 --> 42:17.520]  and crashing prospects as a going concern.
[42:17.520 --> 42:21.520]  It wouldn't surprise me if they considered taking it non-profit
[42:21.520 --> 42:24.520]  if the investors give up on any kind of returns in the future.
[42:24.520 --> 42:33.520]  This is Twitter turning itself into charitable enterprise first
[42:33.520 --> 42:35.520]  and going private concern second.
[42:35.520 --> 42:39.520]  All this is happening in the context of Silicon Valley destroying jobs.
[42:39.520 --> 42:40.520]  They even destroy where they live.
[42:40.520 --> 42:42.520]  Look at the state of San Francisco.
[42:42.520 --> 42:46.520]  Feces and syringes on the streets everywhere.
[42:46.520 --> 42:47.520]  That's San Francisco for you.
[42:47.520 --> 42:49.520]  Downtown San Francisco, not a place you want to live.
[42:49.520 --> 42:50.520]  It's like being on Twitter.
[42:50.520 --> 42:51.520]  It's gruesome.
[42:51.520 --> 43:17.520]  We'll be right back after this with the Michael Moore video.
[43:21.520 --> 43:47.520]  We'll be right back.
[43:47.520 --> 44:13.520]  We'll be right back.
[44:13.520 --> 44:41.520]  We'll be right back.
[44:41.520 --> 45:07.520]  We'll be right back.
[45:07.520 --> 45:33.520]  We'll be right back.
[45:33.520 --> 45:59.520]  We'll be right back.
[45:59.520 --> 46:25.520]  We'll be right back.
[46:25.520 --> 46:51.520]  We'll be right back.
[46:51.520 --> 47:17.520]  We'll be right back.
[47:17.520 --> 47:43.520]  We'll be right back.
[47:43.520 --> 48:09.520]  We'll be right back.
[48:09.520 --> 48:35.520]  We'll be right back.
[48:35.520 --> 49:01.520]  We'll be right back.
[49:01.520 --> 49:27.520]  We'll be right back.
[49:27.520 --> 49:55.520]  We'll be right back.
[49:55.520 --> 50:23.520]  We'll be right back.
[50:23.520 --> 50:45.520]  We'll be right back.
[50:45.520 --> 51:11.520]  We'll be right back.
[51:11.520 --> 51:37.520]  We'll be right back.
[51:37.520 --> 52:03.520]  We'll be right back.
[52:03.520 --> 52:31.520]  We'll be right back.
[52:31.520 --> 52:53.520]  We'll be right back.
[52:53.520 --> 53:13.520]  And here's a video where NBC is delighted to watch that, crowing about the erosion of the Second Amendment and gun-toting Laura Biden Americans giving up on one of the most important principles on which the freedom and security instability of this great nation depends.
[53:13.520 --> 53:25.520]  They're right to defend themselves against the tyranny of government and against marauding fellow citizens. Here's an NBC clip of a man dismantling his own weapon.
[53:25.520 --> 53:43.520]  As she watched the horrifying images of the Parkland shooting, gun owner Amanda Meyer of Connecticut says she needed to do something, so she destroyed her handgun.
[53:43.520 --> 53:57.520]  She also handed over his AR-15 to law enforcement. He bought it as a hobby, but...
[53:57.520 --> 54:05.520]  On social media, some gun owners are getting rid of their rifles and posting pictures under the hashtag One Less Gun.
[54:05.520 --> 54:21.520]  It all started with a Facebook video viewed more than 17 million times of a self-described responsible gun owner with a faded tattoo of the right to bear arms, so moved by the Florida shooting that he sliced his AR-15.
[54:21.520 --> 54:37.520]  The NRA has called the AR-15 the most popular rifle in the U.S., owned by 8 million Americans. Enthusiasts say it's customizable, accurate, and versatile, but it's become the weapon of choice in mass killings.
[54:37.520 --> 54:51.520]  Marcos Avalon is a certified NRA instructor who says banning AR-15s is a mistake.
[54:51.520 --> 55:01.520]  Tonight there is a renewed debate among gun owners themselves over the extent of the Second Amendment when it comes to AR-15s and whether the right is worth the risk.
[55:01.520 --> 55:11.520]  You hear that little thing that was just snuck in there? The extent of the Second Amendment. What is an extent of an inalienable right? It's like being a bit pregnant.
[55:11.520 --> 55:21.520]  What's the extent of the Second Amendment? There's no extent of the Second Amendment. You're just allowed to have guns.
[55:21.520 --> 55:40.520]  What kind of world do these people who are disarming America's citizens want to bring about? Well, it's a world in which kids cannot protect themselves from being stabbed by Syrian immigrant classmates and African men imported to Paris engaging in cannibalism.
[55:40.520 --> 55:53.520]  These are the sorts of cultures the left wants to bring into your nation. These are the sorts of people that America's liberals want roaming the streets at the same time as disarming you.
[55:53.520 --> 56:10.520]  That's two stories that are killing a 15-year-old Lithuanian baby boy, Arminas Pelekas, murdered in the school by a 14-year-old classmate from a family of Syrian refugees. This happened, of course, in Sweden. Where else?
[56:10.520 --> 56:20.520]  No jail time, no punishment for the Syrian kid because he's too young. Well, here's the thing. When you grow up in a war zone, you grow up fast and 15-year-olds are not the same everywhere.
[56:20.520 --> 56:34.520]  A 15-year-old brought up in a cosseted feminist paradise like Sweden is quite different from a 15-year-old who's had to go out and work to make sure the family could be fed.
[56:34.520 --> 56:40.520]  They're being imported into Sweden, stabbing their classmates over, you know what.
[56:40.520 --> 56:50.520]  And the worst story of the week, African men arrested in Paris for cannibalism in the suburbs.
[56:50.520 --> 57:02.520]  Some imports from Cape Verde, arrested on Sunday after they attacked a man who was walking in the Hector Bealeo's alley. They bit off pieces of his ear and his lower lip.
[57:02.520 --> 57:11.520]  It was the suburb and it's becoming well-known as a no-go zone in Paris.
[57:11.520 --> 57:27.520]  That's it. That's the glorious future that liberals who want to take away your guns want you to welcome in the European and Scandinavian worlds of cannibalism and dead kids and no Second Amendment to protect you.
[57:27.520 --> 57:39.520]  And there's NBC talking about the extent of the Second Amendment, just the first step, taking it from an inalienable right to a movable one, just the first step to eradicating it entirely.
[57:39.520 --> 57:58.520]  We'll be back after the break.

[59:10.520 --> 59:13.520]  But immune wall is incredible at folks.

[59:17.520 --> 59:25.520]  Immune wall, beta-glucans, olive leaf, and so much more. It is concentrated. You need to go read what is in here.
[59:25.520 --> 59:31.520]  The mushroom blend of the most expensive, highest quality mushrooms that just incredibly accelerate.
[59:31.520 --> 59:34.520]  A citrus peel blend. I mean, this is the next level.
[59:34.520 --> 59:38.520]  It's now available, ladies and gentlemen, immune wall, I think is beyond seasonal.
[59:38.520 --> 59:40.520]  Beta-glucan, olive leaf, and more.
[59:40.520 --> 59:56.520]  Immune wall, m4store.com, m4slive.com, or triple-eight, 2533139.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:22.520]  Welcome back. This is the center of the resistance.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.520]  As we like to say down here in Austin, I'm Marlon Opples.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:31.520]  We're entering the era of big trans.
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:48.520]  If you're wondering what that interesting expression means, a new report suggests that transgender ideology is being powered by $400 million from business and advocates.
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:53.520]  Transgender activists are, of course, the craziest people in the world.
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:01:02.520]  Now, there are people who suffer from this horrifying condition, not nearly as many as who are diagnosed with it.
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:11.520]  But the question of the transgender lobby isn't about medical ethics or treatment pathways.
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:19.520]  The problem is that it has become entirely a political virtue signalling performance act.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:35.520]  And it's become, as Time Magazine crowned it, the new civil rights frontier with a predictable result that expressing the correct opinion about the trans issue has become the new litmus test for whether or not you're the right kind of person,
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:39.520]  whether or not you are acceptable for polite society.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:55.520]  If there was any doubt that the trans lobby is just a bunch of underprivileged, desperately miserable and highly vulnerable in need activists armed with little but Twitter accounts and their powers of persuasion,
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:08.520]  that has been conclusively debunked by a report that has tracked the flow of pro-transgender funding via donors and business groups to reveal that $400 million
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:23.520]  has now been spent by professional activists to allow men to wander into women's bathrooms to punish, to ritually humiliate, abuse, intimidate, bully and punish
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:29.520]  those of us who believe that medicine should not play second fiddle to political ideology.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:40.520]  What do the studies show? They show that people who have this surgery have rates of regret that are astonishingly high.
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:53.520]  They show that the transition surgery that is being suggested for children by some doctors, doctors saying that prepubescent boys should be put on hormone blockers.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:02.520]  This stuff is very upsetting to anybody who has children who is worried about their children being subject to this kind of ideology in schools.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:16.520]  And I get emails from people who say, my kid's teacher in a public school is telling my child about transgenders because he picked up the wrong toy at playtime or whatever.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:22.520]  They're excited by it. They're almost gleeful. They love this stuff. It's like, oh, I got one in my classroom.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:31.520]  It's sick. It's horrible. And what the studies show is that people who have this surgery don't get better.
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.520]  It doesn't help them. The depression rates and the suicide rates don't improve.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:45.520]  If anything, one particular set of data suggests that they get worse as well as the regret rates we had a caller on the show yesterday said, don't do it.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:54.520]  But this is the new political orthodoxy, and it's not just activists well-funded and hysterical online.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:04:07.520]  This is now the era of big trans. There's big money to be made if you are a sufficiently woke activist, appealing to big business and appealing to private donors
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:24.520]  to push a particular kind, a particularly sociopathic and disgusting kind of political activism, masquerading as medical care, as tolerance, diversity and niceness, niceness being the great cancer of our age.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:31.520]  It's the era of big trans. They're coming for you and you best express the right opinion because if you don't, you could lose your job.
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:40.520]  You could lose your friends. It is professionally disastrous and socially horrifying to step outside the consensus, the media created consensus.
[01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:47.520]  And now there's a hell of a lot of money behind it, making sure that you stay in line. Here are big trans. We'll be right back after this.
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:05:02.520]  Matt and Ohio, you're on the air. Another Matt, go ahead.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:12.520]  Hey, listen, I just wanted to say real quick, I'm a long time listener of N4s, and I just wanted to say that the t-shirts that you guys are offering are absolutely fantastic.
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:24.520]  And that really is a great way to deal with this battle in the N4. It might seem like a simple thing, but they're particularly these slogan t-shirts that you guys got up right now are absolutely amazing.
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:43.520]  Well, thank you. My favorite new one is the don't tread on me, but said it says won't tread on me, and it's a big day glow snake, Gadsden snake, and then it's got the American flag, infowars.com on the right arm.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:59.520]  Trigger warning t-shirt, trigger warning t-shirt, which is the symbol of a trigger with a yield sign in the infowars.com on the back. That is the new shirt of the month available exclusively at infowars.com.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:06.520]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:25.520]  Obviously, this is a really tough tragedy to deal with, but I just wanted to talk to you about your perspective from a sheriff's standpoint with gun control and ask you how much of your call for gun control is rooted in your actual want for gun control as a sheriff, and how much is driven by your own political etiology as a registered Democrat?
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:40.520]  I don't have any of my political etiologies. I just do this right for the community. I don't worry about doing things to get re-elected or elected. I just do this right and safe for the people in the first place.
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:55.520]  I'm for sensible gun control. I understand there's more than one aspect, more than one discipline to mention. That's going to have to come into place for us to be a safe society. We have to have a Baker Act rules extended.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.520]  Yeah.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:01.520]  These officers need to be able to take people into custody who post certain things.
[01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:12.520]  That's the video from Laura Luma confronting the sheriff near the Florida shooting. Very tragic. Before the break, we're talking about the era of big trans.
[01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:27.520]  A new study that shows that $400 million has been used to indoctrinate the American population on the subject of transgenderism, replacing medical ethics and science with political ideology.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:35.520]  Parents now being punished if they are insufficiently woke on the trans question. This is the new era of big trans.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:42.520]  Joining us is Laura Luma, our intrapid reporter from the ground in Florida. Hello, Pumpkin. How are you?
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.520]  I'm doing well. How are you, Milo?
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:57.520]  I'm good. Now, the sound on our sheriff video was not perfect. So give us a quick recap on what the sheriff told you about gun control. And then I want to ask you about some of the other stories that are coming out of that area.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:06.520]  And also, of course, about the ongoing controversy in the media about these kids. What was the sheriff's line on gun control when you asked him?
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:19.520]  Well, I went to a kind of like a memorial site and I saw the sheriff walking around. So I found him and had to ambush him. So the sheriff basically told me, I don't have a political etiology.
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:27.520]  I just do what's best for the community, which is absolute garbage, right? Because this guy ran on the Democratic ticket to become the sheriff of Broward County.
[01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:38.520]  And not only that, but he spotted in multiple pictures rubbing elbows with Hillary Clinton, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Bernie Sanders, Joe Biden. All of your favorites. All of your favorite people.
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:47.520]  And so then what happened is at the end of the interview, he walked away from me because he was pretty annoyed with me. So I followed him and I wouldn't let him get away.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:54.520]  And I shoved my camera in his face again and I said, you say you don't have an etiology, but you're seen in pictures with Hillary and Debbie.
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:02.520]  What's up with that? And he got really angry and gave me the whole, ma'am, ma'am, this interview is over and walked away, just like Sheriff Lombardo in Vegas.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:07.520]  So I really am getting a reputation for being the most hated journalist among America's sheriffs.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:14.520]  You're not going to get any sexy law enforcement boyfriends any time soon, Laura.
[01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:25.520]  So also Milo, I want to add as well, I asked him, I said, so your rhetoric and the department sheriff and the, well, the department's rhetoric and the community's rhetoric is very anti-Trump.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.520]  When are you going to hold the FBI accountable for dropping the ball? Do you agree that they're responsible?
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:35.520]  And he literally said, oh, I don't think that anyone is responsible besides the shooter.
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:45.520]  So this sheriff is so out of touch with reality and is so unwilling to admit the truth that he's willing to contradict what the official FBI statement said.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:51.520]  Even the FBI released a statement saying that they were responsible for this, that they dropped the ball.
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:10:01.520]  So the fact that the sheriff just wants to continue with this false narrative that the shooter was responsible and only responsible for this, I mean, he's out of control.
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:10.520]  People are starting to feel the consequences of stepping out of line and the official version of events here.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:19.520]  Now, I want to be careful about what we say, the words we use and the allegations that we're making and stick strictly to what we know for sure and we can prove.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:29.520]  But many people have noticed that something's a little off about some of the testimony from the students who emerged after the shooting.
[01:10:29.520 --> 01:10:36.520]  And for discussing that, at least one person has lost their job. Florida Lawmaker Aid has been fired.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:43.520]  He's an aide to Sean Harrison, a Republican down in Tampa. He was fired for emailing the Tampa Bay Times the following.
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:50.520]  Both kids in the picture are not students here, but actors that travel to various, you know the message.
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:11:00.520]  So we don't know anything for sure. What people are doing is asking questions because they've noticed something slightly odd.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:07.520]  I happen to find the Twitter stream of the leading girl in this movement, the one who's supposedly organizing the march.
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:10.520]  Of course, she's doing no such thing to be very peculiar.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:20.520]  And it reminds me of Malala Yousafzai, the young hijab Muslim girl with the of course with the UN dad.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:36.520]  They've always got a parent in law enforcement or a parent in some globalist institution who had lines fed to her by her father and read scripted responses out to try to persuade the international community that of course the Islam has nothing to do with terrorism and blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:47.520]  Talk to us about not necessarily about the allegation that these kids are being stitched up and we're going to find out the truth on that.
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:12:06.520]  But what does it say about America that we've gone from a country that used to be pretty rigorously defend free speech to one in which sites of shootings are demolished to cover up any ability of the public to judge for themselves what happened.
[01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:19.520]  Intelligence agencies are silent or, you know, not complicit at least negligent and unapologetic and people who question the official version of events are forced out from their jobs.
[01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:23.520]  What is it? What is it all what's going on?
[01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:36.520]  You know, I think that the idea of calling something a false flag or calling something, you know, not not 100% real or really challenging the official narrative is becoming more mainstream.
[01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:44.520]  Really, in thanks to people like Alex Jones and yourself who are making it more culturally acceptable to question authority figures.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:54.520]  You know, we always saw with these tragedies in the past that it was very taboo to even open your mouth about it and you would get, you know, shunned immediately.
[01:12:54.520 --> 01:13:01.520]  But now, you know, at least I would say almost half the country or really majority of the country is really starting to see that when these events take place, we're not getting the truth.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:12.520]  And there is an aspect of a cover up or there is an aspect of, you know, falsehood that is really leading the discussion about the quote unquote official narrative.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:23.520]  We saw that with the Las Vegas shooting and now we're seeing this as well with this student David hug, who people are calling, you know, an actor whether or not you believe he's an actor or not.
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:38.520]  But the thing that I find most concerning about this student is the fact that his father is an FBI agent, because it really makes you wonder if CNN in combination with our intelligence agencies is using this child as a prop to push forward anti Trump rhetoric from the
[01:13:38.520 --> 01:13:52.520]  pro and the mainstream media. And, you know, I'm not really concerned as to whether he's a student there. I'm really concerned about how the FBI and CNN are using them in their efforts to undermine President Trump and other Republicans.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:14:08.520]  And it's remarkable the extent to which this debate is becoming fact free. There are numerous examples now springing up from all over the world about how to deal with this kind of thing effectively Israel, for instance, after a school shooting after a tragedy there.
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:23.520]  Yeah, it shouldn't say tragedy should be instituted armed teachers, and there have been no shooting since. And this isn't, you know, I mean, all of Israel is a perpetual war zone. You know, I mean, it's Tel Aviv, which is relatively peaceful most of the time, of course.
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:33.520]  But, you know, there are examples now there are clear this clear evidence for what Second Amendment advocates have been saying for some time, which is just on the teachers. That's what they did in Israel.
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:50.520]  It works. But law enforcement is so it seems to me so coopted by the leftist, you know, globalist Democrat vision of the world so united in hostility and opposition to the to the president to guns to everything.
[01:14:50.520 --> 01:15:03.520]  It's it's remarkable to hear a sheriff. I guess they're elected officials with a badge, right? They're not really like regular. They're not really like regular police officers. They're more like politicians really.
[01:15:03.520 --> 01:15:12.520]  But it's remarkable to see somebody in a police badge, spreading, spreading opinions and sharing views that are so obviously counterfactual.
[01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:25.520]  We've entered the realm now of emotion versus emotion and whoever can tell the best story and tug on the greatest heartstrings is going to win factual debate seems to me a very worrying state of affairs, right?
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:41.520]  Yeah, no, and I agree. And if you're going to have the nerve to use your position as an authority figure, whether you be a sheriff or a politician to use children and exploited tragedy to push liberal propaganda, you should have the nerve and the balls to talk to a reporter who asks you questions when a camera shoved in your face.
[01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:49.520]  We have to we have to go to break. If you'd like to hang on just for a second afterwards, I'm I'll ask you about a couple of other things. That's all right, Laura. We'll be right back.

[01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:29.520]  But boy does it stimulate because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription. But they were charging people $100 $200 for the formulae.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:48.520]  And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists and developers non GMO made right here in America 120 capsules.

[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:25.520]  Yet our best trained, best educated, best equipped, best prepared troops refused to fight. As a matter of fact, it's safe to say that they would rather switch than fight.
[01:20:25.520 --> 01:20:41.520]  The Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind. Never were true words spoken. There is a war on for everyone's mind in the Florida shooting.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:21:00.520]  I'm here with Laura Luma, who is in Florida for info wars. Now CNN reporters who are down there are taking the opportunity not just to spread propaganda about gun control, but to harass pensioners for the crime of supporting Trump on Facebook.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:12.520]  CNN showed up in Broward County, presumably they were down there already for the Florida thing, and showed up at an old lady's home because she runs a Facebook group about Trump.
[01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:33.520]  They showed up at the old lady's home. They grew in Goldfarb, runs the team at the team at Trump Broward County Facebook page, which CNN claims posted numerous times about events that were promoted and encouraged by the Russians.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:47.520]  After we play the clip, this clip is CNN showing up at an old lady's home to harass her about so-called Russian collusion because she runs a Facebook page about Trump on the Internet. Here's the clip.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:22:04.520]  What part of it in this is a cover-up? Are you saying that's not true or what? The Russians, I don't care if they were involved or not, that to me is the least important thing. But they were involved with you. Did you guys know that?
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:13.520]  They weren't involved with us. Just make sure that you report it correctly. But you guys were involved with being patriotic, right?
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:24.520]  Very, very patriotic. Being patriotic was the group that contacted and helped organize some of these activities that you posted on your own Facebook account. Those were legitimate.
[01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:28.520]  Those were Russians. They were not Russians. I don't go with the Russians.
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:42.520]  Look at that, my goodness. You can leave it there. Laura, what do you think about this CNN rocking up? I love the dogs in the background. She's out there just like, what are you doing? Who are you? This lovely old lady.
[01:22:42.520 --> 01:22:56.520]  Meanwhile, while they're telling us not to believe in conspiracy theories and how dare we and calm it down and stop it, they're harassing an old lady about Russian collusion. Poor old dear. You should go and talk to her. What do you think?
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:03.520]  Well, you know, I just want to let her know there is the stand your ground policy in Florida.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:16.520]  I would say, I would say, hey, you know what, I think that I would you so stand your ground, you know, the castle doctrine, all you have to establish is that you genuinely in fear of your life or property.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:27.520]  Well, I would say the presence of CNN reporters represents a clear and present and present danger to my family security. There we go. That's that's why she gets the big bucks. Great answer.
[01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:35.520]  Thanks for spending some time with us, Laura, today. CNN reporters on your property representing a clear and present danger.
[01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:47.520]  Just, you know, as a as a health note to our Floridian viewers. Don't don't pull your gun on report. Don't pull your gun on reporters. Whatever you do. Now moving on, Professor Snowflake.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:56.520]  It isn't just students in America who are getting their fueling truck and getting very, very, very upset about it.
[01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:06.520]  A professor in one of America's higher education establishments claims to have had their entire holiday ruined over an op-ed about free speech.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:12.520]  Now, you remember, we talked yesterday about a story that was published on Philly.com about it was a very erudite piece. It's interesting.
[01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:25.520]  It's a thought provoking by no means rabble rousing piece about the erosion of bourgeois values in America and that with, you know, the resulting consequence for for culture.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:40.520]  You'll remember that. Well, the author of that as a professor is obviously quite right. And the way you know she's right is that the breakdown in masculinity in male virtues, the attack on men,
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:50.520]  this idea of toxic masculinity that's run away and men becoming increasingly less able to perform the functions that we traditionally associate with manhood.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:25:00.520]  We know it's true. Why? A report out just this week that says that the armed forces, the army cannot get enough recruits who are actually eligible to join the military
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:08.520]  because people are doing too many drugs, people are, you know, all kinds of bad lifestyle choices brought about by the crisis in masculinity.
[01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:18.520]  Well, anyway, she's writing about all this stuff. Fat, unhealthy Americans threatening Trump's defense surge thanks to a breakdown in the country's bourgeois culture, that sense of discipline.
[01:25:18.520 --> 01:25:29.520]  Anyway, her op-ed, which was anti political correctness, has caused an uproar at the University of Pennsylvania. She says her name is Amy Wax.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:38.520]  Some cultures are better than others and I don't shrink from the word superior. And here's what she told the Wall Street Journal after it happened shortly after my op-ed appeared.
[01:25:38.520 --> 01:25:46.520]  And remember, this is a perfectly reasonable, you know, mild-mannered op-ed. I ran into a colleague I hadn't seen for a while and asked how his summer was going.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:52.520]  He said he'd had a terrible summer and I'm saying he looked so serious I thought someone had died.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:26:01.520]  He then explained that the reason his summer had been ruined was my op-ed and he accused me of attacking and causing damage to the university students and the faculty.
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:08.520]  One of my left-leaning friends at Yale Law School found this story funny. Who would have guessed an op-ed could ruin someone's summer?
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:18.520]  But beyond the absurdity, note the choice of words, attack and damage. A word that you typically use with your enemies, not colleagues or fellow citizens.
[01:26:18.520 --> 01:26:26.520]  At the very least, they're not words that encourage the expression of unpopular ideas, which is of course surely the purpose of higher education in the first place.
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:45.520]  Professor Wax, who wrote a very mild-mannered op-ed, which was anti-political correctness, has now been asked by her dean as a result of her colleagues feeling so attacked, personally victimized by someone expressing an opinion about the trajectory of American culture,
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:58.520]  has been asked by her dean to take a leave of absence and to cease teaching a mandatory first-year course. They're taking her away from students for the crime of expressing an opinion.
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:06.520]  He said the dean said he was getting pressure to banish her for her unpopular points of view and hoped that her departure would quell the controversy.
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:24.520]  When Professor Amy suggested it was his job as leader to resist such illiberal demands, he explained that he's a pluralistic dean who must listen to and accommodate all sides, well, presumably that means all sides on the left.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:41.520]  These speeches are under unprecedented threats in crisis like never before. A free speech related story from Spain, Spanish rapper, has been jailed for a song in which, and some listeners are going to have disagreements with me on this one,
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:55.520]  this is a song in which he glorifies terrorism and he says that the Palma de Mallorca, which is a palace where Spanish Rawls live and spend their summer holidays, deserved an atom bomb and people wanted the deaths of these pigs.
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:28:06.520]  The language of the rap, according to the judge, is extreme provocative, allegorical and symbolic. Well, you know what? It is horrible. It is horrible to glorify terrorists.
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:24.520]  It's stupid to attack people for no reason, but it is also his right as an artist. And I know some people listening to this are going to react with revulsion and displeasure and horror at this, you know, undoubtedly ignorant losers, silly lyrics.
[01:28:24.520 --> 01:28:41.520]  But if you really want to go down the road of Europe, America, and start jailing people, not just for expressing opinions, but for creating art that reflects their political priorities, if you really want to go down that road where artists become jailed for wrongthink,
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:55.520]  you're going the right way about it. This is the path we're headed on, the erosion of the First Amendment, just as bad as the attacks, thanks to Florida on the second. We'll be right back.
[01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:36.520]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you have the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you? I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years. I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:29:36.520 --> 01:29:48.520]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless case. Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt. With the IRS's new programs, there's never been a better time to solve your problem.
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:58.520]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX. That's 800-34-NO-TAX or my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:08.520]  Introducing Floralife, the new probiotic line developed exclusively by InfoWarsLife after years of research on the human microbiome. Not all probiotics are made the same.
[01:30:08.520 --> 01:30:17.520]  Floralife probiotics use a unique targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach and releases directly into the intestines for maximum effect.
[01:30:17.520 --> 01:30:33.520]  This is critical because stomach acid kills most probiotics, so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic, then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet. Floralife supports your body's core, where you need it most, including digestion, regularity, immunity, the gut lining, and metabolism.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:42.520]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system is located in your gut? That's why increasing gut probiotic levels is so important for overall health.
[01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:50.520]  Floralife is sold as a 15-billion probiotic for everyday maintenance care and a 50-billion probiotic for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.
[01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:58.520]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com to pick up your bottle of Floralife probiotics today. That's InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:06.520]  You know, I've got some talking points here about caveman from InfoWarsLife.com, but instead of going with those talking points, let me just give you what I've experienced personally.
[01:31:06.520 --> 01:31:14.520]  From all the lives, tales, and every culture, we know that the bones have the essence. We know chicken noodle soup is great for people that are sick.
[01:31:14.520 --> 01:31:31.520]  Again, in every culture, this has been reported because it works. And there's no way to quantify how strong this is, but the amount of bone protein and the amount of marrow and the amount of concentrated life force that is in this is incredible.
[01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:47.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, whether it's for your joints, whether it's for your arteries and your veins, whether it's for your brain, whether it's for energy, this, ladies and gentlemen, is the strongest, most concentrated bone broth formula out there, and it's amazing.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:57.520]  Find out for yourself today at InfoWarsStore.com. What does it do for you and your family? And again, I want to thank you all for your support. You are funding the Information War in 2018.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:32:12.520]  InfoWarsLive is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine. We have found an extraordinary new natural way to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:27.520]  This is pollen block. In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs from specific farms experienced less seasonal distress symptoms like running nose, itchy watery eyes, and excessive mucus production.
[01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:46.520]  They began studying the effects in published trials, in their published trials. Now we are introducing the fruit of the research, a fast-acting chewable tablet, just two tablets at the first sign of seasonal distress, and fast-acting pollen block starts working in about 15 minutes to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:33:01.520]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally with fast-acting pollen block available now at InfoWarsLive.com or by calling toll 3-888-253-3139.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:22.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:31.520]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:51.520]  Welcome back. If you would like to call in, you may do so. In the last segment of the second hour today, I'll be taking your calls on any subject you like. Call me to compliment my hair, insult my accent, ask for political guidance, or maybe you're going on a date and you want to know what to say to the girl.
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:34:02.520]  Of course, you can call us and talk about any of these substantive and serious issues of the day too. And the number, in case you don't know it by now, is 877-789-2539.
[01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:14.520]  That's 877-789-2539. If you'd like to call in and in 10 or 15 minutes or so after the next break, we will take your calls to round out the hour on any subject you like.
[01:34:14.520 --> 01:34:21.520]  Alex Jones is back in studio in his own show. I don't know if I'll give him his seat back. I haven't decided yet. Maybe he'll be my guest.
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:33.520]  Alex Jones live in studio with me next now, moving from the free speech crisis to one of the primary causes of the clampdown in free speech.
[01:34:33.520 --> 01:34:46.520]  And that is identity politics. Adam Rippen, who appears to have been placed on the Olympian team solely for not only being gay, but also being, well, very gay.
[01:34:46.520 --> 01:35:01.520]  And apparently, in the absence of any talent, but the presence of a flamboyant personality, he's been fated by the media to discuss slipping standards and unusual choices
[01:35:01.520 --> 01:35:04.520]  as a result of the cancer of identity politics.
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:10.520]  Is another homosexual. Chadwick Moore joins us. He is a journalist and media personality.
[01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:16.520]  Probably you will recognize him from Tucker Carlson's show, where he's a regular commentator on social issues.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:24.520]  Anytime they want somebody on to make sense of the nonsense about LGBTQ, whatever.
[01:35:24.520 --> 01:35:30.520]  Chadwick is a former writer for Out Magazine and edits dangerous.com, among other things.
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.520]  Welcome to the show. How are you?
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:38.520]  Great. I'm great. It's it's it's warm and sunny here in New York. So go global warming.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:42.520]  Well, one of the best. Adam Rippen. Adam Rippen.
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:48.520]  Now, I said the other day I wanted to create a new TV show called Straight Eye, because the Netflix has just bought back at Queer Eye,
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:54.520]  which seems to me is quite outdated now. You know, I think we all know what gay people think straight guys should do.
[01:35:54.520 --> 01:36:01.520]  There are a lot of gay people who could do with butching up. Now you're you're towards the butcher end of homosexuals.
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:08.520]  Adam Rippen, however, is not. Now he was he came 10th didn't didn't qualify for the for the American team,
[01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:16.520]  but he was sent out to Pyeongchang anyway and has been given endless media coverage because of his.
[01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:22.520]  Well, you only have to see him. You have to see him in action to know why the media loves him so much.
[01:36:22.520 --> 01:36:30.520]  So what's going on here? Why is the media giving lavish praise and excessive coverage to somebody who isn't that good an athlete?
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:35.520]  What is happening? Why why the Adam Rippen extravaganza on on NBC?
[01:36:35.520 --> 01:36:44.520]  Well, you know, who's not thrilled about Adam Rippen and that's Johnny Weir because he's kind of gunning for his token homosexual news commentator spot.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:51.520]  The media, you know, this is you have Adam Rippen coming out. He's he's saying these ridiculous things about the vice president.
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.520]  People like this, I like to play a game called stupid or sinister.
[01:36:54.520 --> 01:37:01.520]  So is it that he's just stupid and he doesn't really understand that cultures moved beyond where he is as he's stupid.
[01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:09.520]  And he doesn't understand that that that the reason why he's upset about Pence is because of something that had nothing to do with gay people that happened 18 years ago.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:14.520]  Or he more malevolent when he when he virtue signals, you know, like like a Hillary Clinton or something.
[01:37:14.520 --> 01:37:22.520]  And I think with him, the answer we have is he's maybe neither. I think he skews towards the stupid, but he is an opportunist.
[01:37:22.520 --> 01:37:28.520]  And just today on CNBC, he was sort of asked about sponsorships and what he wants coming out of the Olympics.
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:35.520]  And he basically said, I want money. I love money. Well, after you, Adam, that's wonderful. We love people who like money.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:45.520]  The problem here is you're basing it on this this this narrative of gay oppression in America and this narrative of I'm here and I'm queer.
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:51.520]  Get used to it at the Olympics when 20 years old. Yeah, nobody nobody cares anymore.
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:57.520]  I mean, I've been very, very gay, very publicly.
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:02.520]  I've had my face on the side of a bus with the word and I'm allowed to say this so you're not allowed to get upset.
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:10.520]  Listeners, you would faggot on the side of a bus, you know, in huge letters getting offered truck stops in Tennessee in a dress.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:16.520]  And people have said, look me up and down and give me a little sort of like there there, calm it down.
[01:38:16.520 --> 01:38:22.520]  But, you know, and then come up to me and said, said, you know, I don't know about all this lifestyle stuff, but I think what you're doing is brave.
[01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:30.520]  So you carry on the worst that Americans will do is say they'll pray for you, which you know, you could say was a bit patronizing.
[01:38:30.520 --> 01:38:39.520]  But, you know, it's not that's nothing compared to the bile and vitriol that you received, for instance, from coastal liberals because you started expressing the wrong opinions.
[01:38:39.520 --> 01:38:46.520]  When you came out as conservative famously in the New York Post, it was it was far a far worse experience for you.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:51.520]  I would wager than any gay person has had coming out in America in the last 10 years.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:59.520]  What mystifies me about this is, I mean, if he wants to make money, then he should really just be a better skater, shouldn't he?
[01:38:59.520 --> 01:39:10.520]  Because he's not a particularly good one. He's got the he's got the he's got the faggy flounces off, but he doesn't seem to be able to get the high marks necessary to reach the top of his game.
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:22.520]  We've seen this before, haven't we, with people who don't succeed at the highest levels in their chosen sport or profession and who see social activism and identity politics as a route to easy fame and riches.
[01:39:22.520 --> 01:39:24.520]  It's a pattern, isn't it?
[01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:30.520]  Yeah, completely. And I'm sure if we could in a minute name 20 people who've done this.
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.520]  And this goes for Hollywood, too. Look at all the actors who are so subpar.
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:43.520]  I'm thinking of one of them that you've maybe gotten a little scuffle with on Twitter, who then goes into the social justice angle because they have nothing else.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:51.520]  And then, you know, if it works, then they get they get movies, they get roles, simply because they have the right politics and they're good at expressing those politics.
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:54.520]  Oh, look at his punchable little face.
[01:39:54.520 --> 01:40:06.520]  Do you know what? Do you know what? This guy with those overall, I mean, just the over groomed, trimmed, waxed, tweezed, plucked, campy fagginess of it all.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:09.520]  He makes me want to gay bash.
[01:40:09.520 --> 01:40:19.520]  Like, I'm looking, I'm sorry. I'm looking at Adam Rippon. He just makes me want to go out and punch gay people because this is what we have on television.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:26.520]  This is what people think that gay people are. Well, you know what? Guess what? Liberals newsflash. Some gay people are really crap.
[01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:34.520]  Some of us are not. We're not all these beautiful magical elves that you can use to beat Republicans.
[01:40:34.520 --> 01:40:39.520]  Some of us are Republicans and many of us do not subscribe to this.
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:51.520]  You know, like you see love and hip hop and there's like, you know, these, these like sassy black women who always have like a waxed, tweezed and plucked Hispanic gay friend who's just sitting in the wings and kind of loving the drama.
[01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:58.520]  You know, it just makes me want to kill myself and tear my hair out.
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:06.520]  That's why they hate gay conservatives so much because they think they banked so much of their livelihood on this narrative that, you know, they're oppressed and they're whatever they have to like, loud and proud.
[01:41:06.520 --> 01:41:10.520]  And they've got this huge enemy on the right that's trying to take their freedoms away.
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:16.520]  Meanwhile, there's people like you and me and countless others who are like, no, we're conservative. We don't have any kind of a problem.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:24.520]  What do you what else you got? You know, here on the right, we're fighting actual battles that are far more important than the gay rights movement ever was.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:35.520]  And that's what as you as you were mentioning earlier, the battles for the Constitution for free speech and the First Amendment far more important than anything the gay rights movement ever stood for when you consider the consequences down the road.
[01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:40.520]  Right. I mean, at their best, they made a half hearted effort, you know, for AIDS and whatever.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:48.520]  But it was only when AIDS was taken over by the mainstream by straight people that anything good actually happened.
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:54.520]  It was only when straight people started caring that it became that it became an effective protest movement.
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:42:01.520]  And since then being wrapped up in transgender pronouns, instead of the threat of, I don't know, Islam, you know, running out.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:06.520]  It's transgender. All this transgender mania and Islam is driving.
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:10.520]  What do you think about what do you think about big trans, big trans, huge.
[01:42:10.520 --> 01:42:16.520]  So there's a new new report out says $400 million has been spent so far on transgender activism.
[01:42:16.520 --> 01:42:20.520]  And this is primarily led by big, big donors and lobbies and corporations.
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:26.520]  We've got to go in 30 seconds. Give us your opinion on big trans, the corporatization of the transgender lobby.
[01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:34.520]  It has nothing to do with men in dresses, has everything to do with breaking down the family, breaking down what it constructivism,
[01:42:34.520 --> 01:42:39.520]  propagating constructivism and that deconstructivism, I'm sorry.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.520]  And that, you know, the family is not real. Gender is not real. Nothing's real.
[01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:44.520]  We can reinvent society however we want to.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:47.520]  Thank you very much, Chadwick Moore. I'm sorry we don't have more time.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:52.520]  Great to speak to you. Thank you for your assistance. See, listeners, there are some good gay people after all.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:57.520]  We'll be right back. 877-789-2539, if you want to call in the next segment, we'll be right back.

[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:39.520]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important.
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:46.520]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[01:43:46.520 --> 01:43:49.520]  That means it's clean. That means it's pure.
[01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:52.520]  Rest secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the InfoWars.

[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:30.520]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:34.520]  I'm Milo. We're live from Austin, Texas.
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:50.520]  If you've enjoyed this segment, I am at Dangerous.com. That's where I live. You can go to Dangerous.com.
[01:47:50.520 --> 01:48:01.520]  And meanwhile, we're back here in Austin, Texas. And it's simple. The more toxins and diseases you find their way into your system, the more important it is that your body's detox systems can keep up.
[01:48:01.520 --> 01:48:07.520]  Liver and kidneys are super important and milk, thistle, extract will help with that.

[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:54.520]  Thanks to a powerful set of ingredients, including milk, thistle, and acetylcysteine. This is too scientific for a gay person to read.
[01:48:54.520 --> 01:48:59.520]  Amla fruit, buplerum root, licorice root, artichoke leaf, and many more.
[01:48:59.520 --> 01:49:04.520]  Now, moving to the phones. We have three people on the line. We're going to get through those calls as quickly as we can.
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:13.520]  First name is Preston, who is calling from... I don't know where he's calling from. Preston, are you there?
[01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:14.520]  Hello. Can you hear me?
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:16.520]  Hey buddy, how are you? How can we help you?
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.520]  I'm great. I'm doing great. I'm calling from Springfield, Missouri to show me state.
[01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.520]  Welcome.
[01:49:21.520 --> 01:49:25.520]  And Milo, I'm a big fan. Appreciate the work that you do.
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:26.520]  Thank you.
[01:49:26.520 --> 01:49:34.520]  And we are all getting sick of the liberal propaganda, and you are a great asset to our side of fight.
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:35.520]  Thank you very much.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:41.520]  I wanted to say that. You seem to love America quite a bit, especially for a foreign national.
[01:49:41.520 --> 01:49:47.520]  So, a question I've never heard anybody ask you is, do you or have you considered becoming a citizen?
[01:49:47.520 --> 01:49:52.520]  And Paul Joseph Watson, if you're listening, you should put that information out as well.
[01:49:52.520 --> 01:49:55.520]  I think it would be great to have you as an American citizen along with Paul.
[01:49:55.520 --> 01:50:00.520]  Well, thank you very much. If a media career doesn't work out, I could always serve the country in some other way.
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:03.520]  I do think this is the greatest country in the history of human civilization.
[01:50:03.520 --> 01:50:09.520]  I think it is the best nation on earth. I think it has the best values, and that's why I want to see it stay that way,
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:14.520]  which is why I work as hard as I do to stand up for freedoms that I wasn't even born with,
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.520]  and that I am slowly acquiring as a result of being here.
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.520]  Thank you for the compliment and for the question.
[01:50:21.520 --> 01:50:25.520]  We are married, actually, now here, so maybe it'll happen eventually.
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:31.520]  I don't have a tearing hurry, although it would be quite nice to...
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:33.520]  I think it would be nice. It would feel good.
[01:50:33.520 --> 01:50:36.520]  So, yeah, I think maybe I will. We'll see.
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:40.520]  I have to work out. I don't want to pay tax in three different countries. I have to work that out.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:46.520]  But aspiring to be an American citizen is something that not just people from terrible countries want to do.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:50.520]  People from all countries want to do it. You have the best country in the world, and everybody wants to come here.
[01:50:50.520 --> 01:50:54.520]  It would be a good idea, though, if you've filtered out the people who have something to offer
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.520]  and can create some value and create some jobs from the people who want to bring here,
[01:50:58.520 --> 01:51:02.520]  who want to bring jihad, terror, and horror.
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:06.520]  George is our next caller. Thank you, Preston, for that call.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:09.520]  George is our next caller. How are you, sir?
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:12.520]  Oh, fine, Milo. I'm so glad I have an opportunity to speak to you.
[01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:13.520]  Thank you.
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:16.520]  I was thinking of a counter strategy.
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:23.520]  Well, since these teens wanted to ban oil and guns, maybe we should look into how teens drive.
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:31.520]  The last statistics that were shown by the Center of Disease and Control,
[01:51:31.520 --> 01:51:36.520]  our governmental statistics organization, 2015,
[01:51:36.520 --> 01:51:45.520]  there was an average of 2,333 young people died because they were drunk and driving.
[01:51:45.520 --> 01:51:54.520]  And there was 221,300 and 13 were created in emergency rooms because of driving.
[01:51:54.520 --> 01:52:02.520]  So how would they like it if we said nobody between 16 and 25, unless they do not drink,
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:07.520]  should not get a license? Because isn't that more dangerous than a gun,
[01:52:07.520 --> 01:52:12.520]  since so many people are being mowed down by teens that are drunk?
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:17.520]  And then another statistic, unlicensed drivers. This is a very interesting statistic.
[01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:23.520]  This is an average between 2010 and 2014.
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:30.520]  6,577 persons die each year from people who are unlicensed.
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.520]  Half of these were illegal immigrants.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:41.520]  Houston came out with a story just recently where they confiscated any vehicles that couldn't show a valid insurance thing.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:46.520]  And it just happened to be that when they confiscated this most of them were illegals,
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:52.520]  but not all illegals, but it happened that the motor vehicle accidents went down 40% in the city.
[01:52:52.520 --> 01:53:01.520]  So maybe we should take away the cars of all these people that are involved in these types of accidents
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.520]  and how are teens like that?
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:05.520]  That's a good point you're making. Thank you for the call.
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:13.520]  You make two points, really. One is that if we're about saving lives, if our priority is saving people's lives,
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:21.520]  then we behave quite differently, wouldn't we, from the gun control lobby whose objectives seem to be something different.
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:27.520]  Objectives seem to be more related to the breakdowns in freedom, to the overweening control of government
[01:53:27.520 --> 01:53:33.520]  and the rights of citizens to protect themselves against government, far more focused on that, let's say,
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:35.520]  than they are focused on preventing deaths.
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:39.520]  I think more people die beastings than these shootings, don't they?
[01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:49.520]  If you want to save lives, there are much better ways to do it than bearing down on one of the founding principles of the nation's freedom.
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:58.520]  And the second point you make, which is just as good, you know, it's some...
[01:53:58.520 --> 01:54:03.520]  What you're trying to do is analyze a logical argument because you're taking the left at face value
[01:54:03.520 --> 01:54:06.520]  and providing counter-fact for an argument they're not really making.
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:16.520]  And this is a question of whether or not we want to hand over powers, hand over our freedoms to...
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:19.520]  In some cases, you know, the apparatus of the state we didn't elect,
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:27.520]  and it just mystifies me as a visitor to this nation, as somebody who appreciates America as an external spectator
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:33.520]  and as a lover of your way of doing things, how willing so many Americans are to give up their...
[01:54:33.520 --> 01:54:36.520]  I mean, you guys really don't know how good you have it here sometimes.
[01:54:36.520 --> 01:54:39.520]  Let's do a very, very quick call before we have to wrap up the show and we've got some final messages.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:43.520]  And I'm back in the third hour with Alex retaking his hot seat.
[01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:48.520]  I'll be over here. Alex is going to be breaking some news about the Florida...
[01:54:48.520 --> 01:54:50.520]  What do we call it now? Ongoing catastrophe.
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:52.520]  Quickly, let's go to Jonathan on the phones.
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:56.520]  We've got one minute to go with Jonathan. Jonathan, how are you so? How can we help you?
[01:54:56.520 --> 01:55:01.520]  I'm going along nicely. Thanks so much, Milo, for hosting the show while Alex is gone.
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:06.520]  It's been quite a delight. I've always enjoyed your style and grace and how you communicate.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:07.520]  Thank you.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:11.520]  Very articulate and very in the know and a diverse topic, and you've been through a lot,
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:14.520]  and I'm really glad you're out there championing for us.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.520]  Thank you.
[01:55:15.520 --> 01:55:19.520]  Now, I feel, with that being said, I feel safe coming out to you in this way.
[01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:25.520]  And I look at the trans community, I look at transgender and trans species and trans race
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:29.520]  and everyone. And as a Canadian, I think I feel like a trans nationalist.
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:32.520]  I've always identified as American. I love Donald Trump.
[01:55:32.520 --> 01:55:38.520]  I get persecuted for my beliefs up here for embracing such a remarkable leader.
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.520]  And I don't think I could marry an American woman in a kind of time slot.
[01:55:42.520 --> 01:55:44.520]  They're changing the rules to get in the country.
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:48.520]  But I feel if I'm a trans nationalist, I should be able to cross the border with open arms
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.520]  and greeted by my liberal friends.
[01:55:50.520 --> 01:55:55.520]  I'll make my way down south to the good hearted people.
[01:55:55.520 --> 01:56:03.520]  Maybe there should be some kind of ideological purity test put into the citizenship requirements
[01:56:03.520 --> 01:56:04.520]  as well.
[01:56:04.520 --> 01:56:11.520]  Look, there are a small slice of people every generation who truly believe in freedom of
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:15.520]  expression, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, freedom of everything.
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:20.520]  And those people, you know, it's incumbent upon us to stand up for our values, to explain
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:25.520]  what we believe in and to stick up for it on behalf of everybody else, on behalf of the sleepwalkers.
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:31.520]  Because, you know, at any given time in history, most of the people in the West just blindly
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:36.520]  inherit the freedoms and rights that they have without realizing what was given up,
[01:56:36.520 --> 01:56:39.520]  what was sacrificed to accomplish them, to achieve them.
[01:56:39.520 --> 01:56:45.520]  The first generation, the millennial generation, in particular, gruesomely entitled because
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:51.520]  they are the first generation to grow up without really experiencing war or terror or horrors
[01:56:51.520 --> 01:56:55.520]  of any kind except, of course, being misgendered.
[01:56:55.520 --> 01:57:00.520]  So, you know, I think a lot of people who look out on the state of free speech, free expression,
[01:57:00.520 --> 01:57:04.520]  capitalism and all the rest of it in the West are looking to America for hope, but America
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:07.520]  is increasingly not providing that hope for the rest of the world.
[01:57:07.520 --> 01:57:10.520]  And Donald Trump will help to improve the situation.
[01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:11.520]  Who knows?
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:13.520]  Thank you very much for the call, Jonathan.
[01:57:13.520 --> 01:57:15.520]  I hope you've enjoyed the last two hours.
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:18.520]  I have been standing in for Alex Jones.
[01:57:18.520 --> 01:57:23.520]  But it is the Alex Jones show, and the great man is back in the hot seat after this break.
[01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:24.520]  I've been Miley Annopoulos.
[01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:25.520]  You can see more from me.
[01:57:25.520 --> 01:57:29.520]  The Milo Show goes out Monday to Friday, dangerous.com, slash join.
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:35.520]  We will be right back with Alex Jones here on the Alex Jones show for hour number three.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:37.520]  See you shortly.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:20.520]  Thank you.
[01:58:20.520 --> 01:58:22.520]  Well, let me just say something, Victor.
[01:58:22.520 --> 01:58:25.520]  It's people like you that then fund the whole operation because a very small percentage
[01:58:25.520 --> 01:58:29.520]  of people buy products and a very small percentage of them buy a lot of the products.
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:30.520]  So thank you.
[01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:34.520]  But when you mention the Silver Bullet, Coil Silver, it's got thousands of reviews.
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:39.520]  A 98% review, it is our highest reviewed product because it is from the top lab in the country
[01:58:39.520 --> 01:58:41.520]  discounted high quality Coil Silver.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:48.520]  It's not a Silver Bullet, but it's the closest thing you're going to find to a Silver Bullet.

[02:00:10.520 --> 02:00:14.520]  It says 102.50 on the screen. You want to fix that to one if it's one?
[02:00:14.520 --> 02:00:17.520]  Okay, all set.
[02:00:17.520 --> 02:00:19.520]  Welcome back.
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:23.520]  We're here in the Crazy Town hot seat zone.
[02:00:23.520 --> 02:00:26.520]  This is Myla Yiannopoulos standing in for Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:33.520]  Now, much controversy everywhere in the media about the question of these kids.
[02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:37.520]  What did they know? Who have they been coached by? What's been happening?
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:41.520]  Jim Hoff's been in huge trouble. The guy who runs Gateway Pundit.
[02:00:41.520 --> 02:00:47.520]  Massive trouble for allowing one of his writers to accuse them of being quote-unquote
[02:00:47.520 --> 02:00:49.520]  crisis actors. Quite a claim.
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:53.520]  Well, Alex Jones here at InfoWars has been doing the research.
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:57.520]  Jim Hoff himself from Gateway Pundit is going to be on talking.
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:00:59.520]  Alex Jones has just walked into the building.
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:02.520]  We're about to have him after this break coming up.
[02:01:02.520 --> 02:01:04.520]  He's gone through the evidence.
[02:01:04.520 --> 02:01:09.520]  He's looking at exactly what we know and what we do not know about these guys.
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:14.520]  And joining me after the break in just a moment will be Alex Jones getting to the
[02:01:14.520 --> 02:01:18.520]  heart of what a lot of people have noticed about these child actors is that
[02:01:18.520 --> 02:01:20.520]  there's something seems to be off.
[02:01:20.520 --> 02:01:25.520]  Something seems to be a bit peculiar about the scripted Twitter accounts,
[02:01:25.520 --> 02:01:30.520]  the scripted media appearances, and then the occasional kind of jumps off message
[02:01:30.520 --> 02:01:33.520]  and all the rest of it. And that strange video of the same boy in California.
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:35.520]  We're going to find out exactly what's happening.
[02:01:35.520 --> 02:02:04.520]  We'll be right back with Alex Jones in the hot seat.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:16.520]  I love Satan so much. Thank you.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:18.520]  I kill my kids.
[02:02:18.520 --> 02:02:47.520]  We came, we saw, we died.
[02:02:47.520 --> 02:02:54.520]  It's a guy on the radio who apparently trumps on his show frequently.
[02:02:54.520 --> 02:02:56.520]  He says me and Hilary are demons.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:00.520]  Said we smell life's bubble. Ain't that something?
[02:03:00.520 --> 02:03:03.520]  I had never seen or smelled any woman like that, ever.
[02:03:03.520 --> 02:03:05.520]  People are telling me she smelled.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:07.520]  Who could not notice someone who smelled that bad?
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:18.520]  And in a room filled by a pot that God was hobbling around from after us.
[02:03:18.520 --> 02:03:24.520]  My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go, ah, ah, ah.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:26.520]  We'll stuff ourselves in the crap.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:31.520]  We don't even notice and it's up rising up against us.
[02:03:31.520 --> 02:03:39.520]  The villains are pointing people. The fair was tapping. I'm so pissed.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:43.520]  We're going to stab your daughter at the mall.
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:47.520]  Oh, my God.
[02:03:47.520 --> 02:03:54.520]  We're going to stab your wife, your son.
[02:03:54.520 --> 02:04:01.520]  We're going to stab you with a bullet tonight and then the police chief is going to say.
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:06.520]  We love our smiley. We love our Muslims.
[02:04:06.520 --> 02:04:10.520]  Oh, they're so good. Oh, they're so sweet.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:19.520]  I was watching Fox News as I worked out this morning and they had the police chief on making excuses from that town of Minnesota.
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:24.520]  And they had the Fox News host. This is the fair and balance channel going.
[02:04:24.520 --> 02:04:26.520]  Donald Trump really stepped in at this time.
[02:04:26.520 --> 02:04:55.520]  He was a bombing before it had officially been called a bombing and Hillary's on him and she's got some really good points.
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:05:02.520]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:05.520]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:09.520]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[02:05:09.520 --> 02:05:14.520]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:18.520]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:29.520]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:34.520]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:39.520]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[02:05:39.520 --> 02:05:48.520]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[02:05:56.520 --> 02:06:19.520]  Welcome back, we are here in the epicenter of global freedom.
[02:06:19.520 --> 02:06:21.520]  Austin, Texas, the InfoWars Studio.
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:24.520]  I am Marley Annopoulos sitting in for your usual host.
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:30.520]  Now look, I've had someone calling me all day, texting me all day.
[02:06:30.520 --> 02:06:33.520]  Please, can I come on? Please, I've got breaking news.
[02:06:33.520 --> 02:06:37.520]  He won't leave me alone. I've finally taken pity on him.
[02:06:37.520 --> 02:06:41.520]  So my new chief investigative reporter is in studio with me today.
[02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:46.520]  I've taken pity on him at last and given him an hour.
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:49.520]  Take it away, chief investigative reporter.
[02:06:49.520 --> 02:06:51.520]  Well, Milo, it is good to be here with you.
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:56.520]  And of course, he's jovial and I was seriously already playing a mirror today, but not on such a serious information.
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:07:03.520]  Always jovial, always very, very funny, always a very gay lad over here, always in a good mood.
[02:07:03.520 --> 02:07:04.520]  The old meaning of that.
[02:07:04.520 --> 02:07:07.520]  So yes, thanks for having me here on The Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:07.520 --> 02:07:08.520]  You're welcome.
[02:07:08.520 --> 02:07:15.520]  So you have been digging deep into the Florida crisis situation.
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:22.520]  I think what most people are interested in is the internet ablaze with rumors that there's something off about these kids.
[02:07:22.520 --> 02:07:24.520]  There's something off about the reporting in general.
[02:07:24.520 --> 02:07:33.520]  Now, Gateway Pundit, the blog, has got into a lot of trouble for posting a piece by Lucian Wintrick that said that they were quote unquote crisis actors,
[02:07:33.520 --> 02:07:43.520]  which is a big claim to make after a huge tragedy that these children, survivors of a brutal mass shooting that killed 17 people, are being coached.
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:46.520]  And there's something not quite right about them.
[02:07:46.520 --> 02:07:52.520]  Video coming out about the boy in California, all kinds of stuff, photos of them in CNN being deleted.
[02:07:52.520 --> 02:07:58.520]  You have spent the time that I've been co-hosting, digging deep into the details here and finding out what really happened.
[02:07:58.520 --> 02:07:59.520]  What have you discovered?
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.520]  Well, first some background.
[02:08:01.520 --> 02:08:09.520]  I started seeing these anomalies last Friday and I don't normally tell the crew, here's they're so intrepid and I trust them,
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:15.520]  hey, hold off on stuff. But I said they misrepresented what we said about Sandy Hook that had a lot of anomalies.
[02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:20.520]  And they've been misrepresenting a lot of other things that we've said and done.
[02:08:20.520 --> 02:08:31.520]  And on Friday, NBC News and others were saying, oh, you know, Jones is trying to say nothing happened in Florida like he always does.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:33.520]  Well, as you notice, there's no video.
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:35.520]  There's no audio of that.
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.520]  That's not what we've said.
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:38.520]  That's not what we've done.
[02:08:38.520 --> 02:08:47.520]  Now, I ended up taking some time off to that I was going to use for launching some of the new satellite uplinks and big TV deals that we've already gotten done,
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:49.520]  that I'll be announcing in the next few weeks.
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:53.520]  But instead of doing a workcation on that, I have been on this.
[02:08:53.520 --> 02:09:09.520]  I even something I didn't really do. I stayed home much today or stay and just got in front of my office computer and I spent six hours at least doing deep research so that I can tell the viewers and the listeners what we've discovered.
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:13.520]  There's so much evidence that it gives me a headache.
[02:09:13.520 --> 02:09:16.520]  And I think you just alluded to the beginning of it.
[02:09:16.520 --> 02:09:20.520]  What we do know is there's a cover up going on.
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:36.520]  They are pulling videos of this young man, a David Hogg, whose father is an FBI agent, whose mother is a big Democrat and big anti-gun person, who is an anti-gun activist and been in a bunch of anti-gun videos and reports already.
[02:09:36.520 --> 02:09:48.520]  They are pulling these videos everywhere and pulling videos on Facebook, Instagram, you name it, from their own sites of him in some type of CNN visit internship VIP thing.
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:53.520]  Then they're pulling photos of them in the drama department with the other three students.
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:55.520]  So A, there's a cover up going on.
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:04.520]  B, when you pull back from this, they are demonizing anyone that even asks questions.
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:17.520]  Well, when you're a young person and a survivor and I believe the mass shooting happened and when you end up being a spokesperson in the adult life and you're a senior in high school and you're articulate, you're in a man's world.
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:33.520]  So you can't then have the Democratic Party, CNN, MSNBC, go and get four students out of 3,000 at the school and it's four students that we're hearing about and then it just goes on from there.
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:34.520]  So I want to be clear.
[02:10:34.520 --> 02:10:37.520]  From our deep research, I've got like 16 video clips here.
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:40.520]  I've interviewed multiple students on air, off air.
[02:10:40.520 --> 02:10:46.520]  We've played clips of national news, people shooting iPhone video over national news.
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:48.520]  We're students are multiple shooters.
[02:10:48.520 --> 02:10:51.520]  I witnessed two people at the same time shooting.
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:58.520]  I saw Nicholas, the reported shooter Cruz with other people when shots are going off.
[02:10:58.520 --> 02:10:59.520]  He didn't have a weapon.
[02:10:59.520 --> 02:11:05.520]  None of that's getting out even though the news is interviewing lines of people the day it happens.
[02:11:05.520 --> 02:11:10.520]  And I've had guests on this said, oh, yeah, almost everybody I talked to said there were two shooters and that there had been a drill.
[02:11:10.520 --> 02:11:11.520]  They were firing blanks.
[02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:18.520]  And so so and then now we even found national news admitting they had a drill with blanks being fired.
[02:11:18.520 --> 02:11:22.520]  Not a month before the Secret Service, but that day.
[02:11:22.520 --> 02:11:28.520]  So all we're saying is what in Hades is going on here.
[02:11:28.520 --> 02:11:37.520]  So we're going to walk through this in the hour and then Jim Hoft, very respected gateway pundit, broken hundreds of top stories, thousands of major stories.
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:41.520]  I mean, just amazing sources inside the White House drudge links to it all the time.
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:47.520]  And he simply had one of his writers point out what was already on fire yesterday.
[02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:52.520]  And here's the headline school exposed school shooting survivor turned activist.
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.520]  David Hogg's father is FBI.
[02:11:54.520 --> 02:11:56.520]  Well, he is the school shooting survivor.
[02:11:56.520 --> 02:12:04.520]  He has turned activist and his father is FBI appears to have been coached on anti Trump lines.
[02:12:04.520 --> 02:12:10.520]  Now you've got him clearly, you know, when somebody's reading on a teleprompter or mess up their lines or can't remember them.
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:14.520]  I was at a school function last night and my oldest daughter couldn't remember some lines.
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:15.520]  It kind of choked.
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:16.520]  She never does that.
[02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:17.520]  She usually wins.
[02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:18.520]  But it was she kind of choked a little bit.
[02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:20.520]  You could tell she was choking.
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:21.520]  So maybe it's stress.
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:22.520]  Whatever.
[02:12:22.520 --> 02:12:24.520]  We're not saying it didn't happen.
[02:12:24.520 --> 02:12:30.520]  But everything that was put in that article we'd already covered simply pointing it out.
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:45.520]  So let's put some more of the images of him at CNN and again him with the CBS producers with the rest of school in an anti gun piece that they did last year.
[02:12:45.520 --> 02:12:47.520]  Yes, you, you, you, you heard me right.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.520]  So these are all drama students.
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:54.520]  They're also in the school paper.
[02:12:54.520 --> 02:12:55.520]  They want to be journalists.
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:58.520]  They're, they're trying to get internships at CNN.
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:02.520]  They're doing CBS interviews that are anti gun before this happens.
[02:13:02.520 --> 02:13:12.520]  And we have a student joining us at the bottom of the hour, who is a real student gave aside his ID is on the school site.
[02:13:12.520 --> 02:13:15.520]  Snopes came out and said he's an actor.
[02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:20.520]  This group funded by Soros that runs internet that sensors you and everybody else who is the arbiter of truth.
[02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:21.520]  No judge, no jury.
[02:13:21.520 --> 02:13:23.520]  Just just judge dread Snopes.
[02:13:23.520 --> 02:13:27.520]  They came out and said this is fake by info wars.
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:30.520]  This, this person isn't real.
[02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:31.520]  We'll put it up on screen.
[02:13:31.520 --> 02:13:36.520]  This, this young black man, Jalen Martin, he isn't real.
[02:13:36.520 --> 02:13:38.520]  He lives 200 miles away.
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:44.520]  So he then got up calling Snopes, got on the phone, they said, Oh, we know you're at the school.
[02:13:44.520 --> 02:13:46.520]  We thought someone stole your identity.
[02:13:46.520 --> 02:13:53.520]  So they're saying Jalen Martin, who's on record a senior and survived and who, by the way, knew the shooter as well.
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:55.520]  They're saying he's a fake.
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:01.520]  Okay, so they're saying what they're, they're saying what they say we said when we didn't say it.
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:07.520]  We, and I agree with Gateway Pundit said school shooting survivor turned activist.
[02:14:07.520 --> 02:14:13.520]  David Hogg's father's FBI appears to have been coached on anti Trump lines.
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:14.520]  There's no appeared.
[02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:15.520]  There are 3000 students.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.520]  Take this away.
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:19.520]  Four of them.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:20.520]  I can't turn on the radio.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:23.520]  We have every major cable channel on it.
[02:14:23.520 --> 02:14:35.520]  All you see, and then they're laughing and giggling and having fun and hamming the camera and doing narcissists flip outs and are just on cloud 5 billion right now.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:41.520]  In my opinion, 9000 in a, in a, in a, in a man and woman's world and an adult world.
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:47.520]  They are on television in front of God and country saying, how dare you do this to us?
[02:14:47.520 --> 02:14:49.520]  No more, not one more dead young person.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.520]  Trump, you will get rid of the guns.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.520]  All gun crime is your fault.
[02:14:52.520 --> 02:14:54.520]  Well, if somebody runs over the car, it's not their fault.
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:14:55.520]  Somebody stabs somebody.
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.520]  Somebody sells somebody heroin.
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:14:58.520]  It's not, you know, everybody who ever took an opiate's fault.
[02:14:58.520 --> 02:15:05.520]  But we're supposed to just take this guilt on and let people sit there and lecture us, you know, in a man's world.
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:07.520]  And then, oh, your dad's FBI.
[02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:11.520]  Oh, your mom's a big Hillary supporter and Bernie supporter and Democrat and anti gun and an activist.
[02:15:11.520 --> 02:15:15.520]  And you're in anti gun videos with national television and all this.
[02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:20.520]  And the school stood down and people stood down even though the girlfriend says he was going to kill everybody.
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:21.520]  We want everybody.
[02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:25.520]  We've interviewed the man that called the FBI on cruise and they wouldn't do anything.
[02:15:25.520 --> 02:15:31.520]  But none of you guys standing down with a clearly autistic individual saying and doing all this have anything to blame.
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:33.520]  I'm not blaming the students or even the school.
[02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:34.520]  I'm blaming the government.
[02:15:34.520 --> 02:15:36.520]  And then I'm to blame.
[02:15:36.520 --> 02:15:39.520]  And then if I go, wait, why is it four of you out of 3000?
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:40.520]  And why are you all hooked up with the Democrats?
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:42.520]  And why are you already in anti gun programs?
[02:15:42.520 --> 02:15:44.520]  And why are you trying to do internships at CNN?
[02:15:44.520 --> 02:15:50.520]  And then I asked that I'm supposed to be banned forever and aids to congressmen are being fired for pointing out these kids.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:53.520]  Look like actors from some Saturday morning special.

[02:19:15.520 --> 02:19:43.520]  Thank you for your time.
[02:19:43.520 --> 02:20:03.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:31.520]  You never want a serious crisis to go to waste.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:36.520]  Never waste a good crisis.
[02:20:36.520 --> 02:20:43.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. They never want to let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:48.520]  I am not saying that there wasn't a mass shooting in Florida.
[02:20:48.520 --> 02:20:54.520]  But when Islamists that Obama and Hillary turn loose in the Middle East kill close to a million people, it's not even a news item.
[02:20:54.520 --> 02:20:56.520]  It's called an Arab Spring.
[02:20:56.520 --> 02:21:04.520]  When Christians and Jews and non-radical Muslims get killed and sold into slavery and little girls gang right by over 100 men, it doesn't even hit our news.
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:06.520]  15 young people die.
[02:21:06.520 --> 02:21:08.520]  It's the end of the world and it's all gun owners fault.
[02:21:08.520 --> 02:21:10.520]  Now, remember Ram Emanuel.
[02:21:10.520 --> 02:21:20.520]  Ram Emanuel on the Wall Street Journal television years ago said, you don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:21:20.520 --> 02:21:24.520]  And Hillary, as you just saw, said that as well.
[02:21:24.520 --> 02:21:28.520]  Milo Yiannopoulos, best selling author, talk show host is co-hosting with me here today.
[02:21:28.520 --> 02:21:33.520]  But I wanted to just get to the meat potatoes of what we know.
[02:21:33.520 --> 02:21:36.520]  People want the truth about crisis actors.
[02:21:36.520 --> 02:21:43.520]  We know the Democratic Party has hired crisis actors and run ads for demonstrations and things like that before and to go out and stir up trouble.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:47.520]  We've gotten the internal contracts where they even wanted them to cause civil unrest.
[02:21:47.520 --> 02:21:50.520]  I'm not saying these are crisis actors.
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:58.520]  In the media, when we talk about them being actors, being in journalist school, being fans of CNN, being in anti-gun programs already,
[02:21:58.520 --> 02:22:06.520]  they're clearly coached and out of 3,000 students, 3,000 students at that high school in Florida,
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:10.520]  four of them are who you see on 99% of the news.
[02:22:10.520 --> 02:22:13.520]  And I've talked to students, we have one coming up in the next segment,
[02:22:13.520 --> 02:22:16.520]  many of the students are very up and minded or pro-gun.
[02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:19.520]  But none of these students, I've talked to some of them, they're coming up,
[02:22:19.520 --> 02:22:22.520]  are put on the news because CNN or others will say, what's your view?
[02:22:22.520 --> 02:22:23.520]  They'll do a pre-interview.
[02:22:23.520 --> 02:22:26.520]  When they're pro-gun, they're not invited to the town hall.
[02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:28.520]  They're not invited on the program.
[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:30.520]  So, are we saying the shooting didn't happen?
[02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:33.520]  Are we saying they're all actors and that they're faking that something happened?
[02:22:33.520 --> 02:22:36.520]  No, the media is saying that.
[02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:40.520]  What we're saying is that, just as Gateway Pundit wrote,
[02:22:40.520 --> 02:22:50.520]  school shooting survivor turned activist dad Hogg's father in FBI appears to have been coached on anti-Trump lines.
[02:22:50.520 --> 02:22:51.520]  That's all true.
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:59.520]  School shooting survivor turned activist, his dad is in the FBI and he appears to be heavily coached.
[02:22:59.520 --> 02:23:06.520]  And then it's the same four people over and over and over again.
[02:23:06.520 --> 02:23:14.520]  And now he's gone on national television to say over and over again with the known CIA operative,
[02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.520]  Anderson Cooper.
[02:23:16.520 --> 02:23:19.520]  So the guy's dad's FBI, he's on the CIA guy's show.
[02:23:19.520 --> 02:23:22.520]  Fake news, CNN, known for staging things.
[02:23:22.520 --> 02:23:25.520]  And he says over and over again, I am not a crisis actor.
[02:23:25.520 --> 02:23:27.520]  I am not a crisis actor.
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:28.520]  I am not a crisis actor.
[02:23:28.520 --> 02:23:30.520]  No, you're a Democratic Party operative.
[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:32.520]  Your father and your mother are on record.
[02:23:32.520 --> 02:23:33.520]  You go to CNN.
[02:23:33.520 --> 02:23:35.520]  You're all over other news programs being anti-gun.
[02:23:35.520 --> 02:23:40.520]  You were interviewed by CBS to give your whole anti-gun spiel before all this happened.
[02:23:40.520 --> 02:23:46.520]  And so what we're saying is you're being used as a tool, as a spokesman, as a mouthpiece so people can say,
[02:23:46.520 --> 02:23:52.520]  oh, it's a child, don't disagree with what he says when he says not one more child can die giving your guns.
[02:23:52.520 --> 02:23:53.520]  Well, you're not a child.
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:57.520]  You're a senior in high school who's in journalism school and also in drama.
[02:23:57.520 --> 02:23:59.520]  And so are your other friends.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.520]  And so you're now in this world.
[02:24:01.520 --> 02:24:06.520]  And we're going to point out that why out of 3,000 is it only this four?
[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:08.520]  Here he is saying he's not a child actor.
[02:24:08.520 --> 02:24:13.520]  First of all, that Donald Trump Jr. is liking tweets, espousing a conspiracy theory,
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:18.520]  involving you and your dad. I'm wondering what goes through your mind when you hear that.
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:24.520]  I'm just so sorry that these people have lost their faith in America because I know I certainly haven't.
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:30.520]  The fact that these people refuse to believe that something like this could happen is something that all of us don't want to believe.
[02:24:30.520 --> 02:24:34.520]  But the sad truth is that it is.
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:40.520]  These people saying this is absolutely disturbing and I'm not an actor in any sense, way, shape, or form.
[02:24:40.520 --> 02:24:44.520]  I'm the son of a former FBI agent and that is true.
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:48.520]  But as such, it is also true that I went to that I go to Stoneman Douglas High School.
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:50.520]  When was the last time you ever heard a kid say as such?
[02:24:50.520 --> 02:24:53.520]  I was looking off and reading.
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:56.520]  When was the last time you ever heard a kid say as such?
[02:24:56.520 --> 02:24:58.520]  In that way.
[02:24:58.520 --> 02:25:00.520]  As such.
[02:25:00.520 --> 02:25:01.520]  Well, that's the whole thing is.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:08.520]  It's unbelievable to me that these people are even saying this and the fact that Donald Trump Jr. liked that post is disgusting to me.
[02:25:08.520 --> 02:25:16.520]  But it's also false in terms of the sense that these people keep saying that I'm anti-Second Amendment.
[02:25:16.520 --> 02:25:17.520]  I'm not.
[02:25:17.520 --> 02:25:19.520]  I would love if I want every American.
[02:25:19.520 --> 02:25:21.520]  There's a classic Bloomberg line.
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:23.520]  Everything out of these guys' mouths.
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:24.520]  It's a lie.
[02:25:24.520 --> 02:25:26.520]  It paused for a minute.
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:34.520]  Milo, all I'm saying is Jim Hoff shouldn't be kicked off speaking engagements and they shouldn't have members of Congress's AIDS being fired
[02:25:34.520 --> 02:25:37.520]  because they said these kids look like actors and sound like it.
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:42.520]  It's all the same four ones and all these anti-gun deals and CBS News reports.
[02:25:42.520 --> 02:25:46.520]  I mean, we've got all this and now day one, they're the only ones all over the news.
[02:25:46.520 --> 02:25:48.520]  I mean, that right there Milo.
[02:25:48.520 --> 02:25:49.520]  It's just very weird to me.
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:56.520]  You've got this town where the biggest news story of the month, maybe it's going to turn into the biggest news story of the year is happening.
[02:25:56.520 --> 02:25:59.520]  It's swarming with reporters.
[02:25:59.520 --> 02:26:01.520]  Everywhere you look, there are reporters.
[02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:05.520]  Everywhere you look, there are journalists and news cameras.
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:11.520]  And yet the only people allowed to be interviewed are these same couple of kids.
[02:26:11.520 --> 02:26:13.520]  That's not how crises work.
[02:26:13.520 --> 02:26:15.520]  I've been a journalist for like eight, nine years.
[02:26:15.520 --> 02:26:17.520]  This is not how it works on the ground.
[02:26:17.520 --> 02:26:19.520]  You get whoever you can.
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:26.520]  There must have been some kind of organizational decision making to put these four kids forward.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.520]  Someone's made that decision and they've made that decision in consultation with parents, with the teachers.
[02:26:30.520 --> 02:26:35.520]  And they hit the ground within before the shootings even over.
[02:26:35.520 --> 02:26:39.520]  Hog is videotaping in closets like the aliens are at the door.
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:40.520]  They're about to kill us.
[02:26:40.520 --> 02:26:42.520]  I mean, it's like, oh my God, they're coming.
[02:26:42.520 --> 02:26:44.520]  It's like Blair Witch Project.
[02:26:44.520 --> 02:26:47.520]  And then they're out there everywhere, everywhere, everywhere, everywhere.
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:48.520]  Yeah.
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:50.520]  I mean, look, but no one else.
[02:26:50.520 --> 02:26:57.520]  What's really bizarre to me is that these four kids, all of whom have the same opinion.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:03.520]  All four kids share the same views, the same ideas about what should happen.
[02:27:03.520 --> 02:27:04.520]  All appear.
[02:27:04.520 --> 02:27:07.520]  They're all beautifully eloquent, nicely turned out.
[02:27:07.520 --> 02:27:08.520]  Look at this.
[02:27:08.520 --> 02:27:10.520]  They've all got glamour shots.
[02:27:10.520 --> 02:27:12.520]  Her document cam on this shot show the HD of it.
[02:27:12.520 --> 02:27:13.520]  They've all got glamour shots.
[02:27:13.520 --> 02:27:14.520]  Right.
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:19.520]  And here they are with CBS News doing an anti-gun shoot.
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:21.520]  This is Broward County.
[02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:24.520]  I mean, Broward County is not a particularly lovely bit of Florida.
[02:27:24.520 --> 02:27:26.520]  There are a couple of nice homes there.
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:29.520]  You know, on average, you know, slightly whatever.
[02:27:29.520 --> 02:27:34.520]  But Broward County is where XXXTentacion comes from, the rapper who was, you know,
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:37.520]  who was put in prison for beating up his pregnant girlfriend.
[02:27:37.520 --> 02:27:39.520]  This is not, you know, Pompano Beach and whatever is in Florida.
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.520]  This is not a beautiful bit of Florida, I'm sorry to say.
[02:27:43.520 --> 02:27:49.520]  And for these perfectly turned out, look, I'm not, I don't, I'm not in a position having
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:52.520]  not done the amount of research that you have done to make a conclusive assessment.
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:56.520]  I don't know for sure, but what I can tell every, every instinct I have,
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:59.520]  every journalistic instinct I have is telling me that there is something up.
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:03.520]  And by the way, on Facebook, Twitter, everywhere, despite the media force-feeding this,
[02:28:03.520 --> 02:28:07.520]  no one I know is buying, including family, that thinks I'm wrong a lot of the time.
[02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:10.520]  Everyone is like, Alex, why aren't you saying it's fake?
[02:28:10.520 --> 02:28:11.520]  Yeah.
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:13.520]  Look at these actors, look at these polished kids.
[02:28:13.520 --> 02:28:17.520]  They're all saying the same crap, but it's only them out of 3,000 kids.
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:21.520]  And then if you even begin to, oh, his dad's FBI, his mom's a big Democrat.
[02:28:21.520 --> 02:28:25.520]  He's going and hanging out at CNN and at the CNN News Center and doing VIP intern visits.
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:27.520]  And so are the other kids.
[02:28:27.520 --> 02:28:31.520]  They go, oh my God, you say the kids didn't get hurt, nothing happened, Alex.
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:33.520]  And we're not saying that.
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:34.520]  We're simply asking questions.
[02:28:34.520 --> 02:28:37.520]  We'll be right back with Milo Genopoulos and more.
[02:28:37.520 --> 02:28:40.520]  We've got one of the students they don't want you to hear from on the other side of this break,
[02:28:40.520 --> 02:28:44.520]  infowars.com, newswars.com, and dangerous.com.
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:45.520]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:45.520 --> 02:28:46.520]  Stay with us.
[02:28:46.520 --> 02:28:54.520]  Come on, come on, come on, come on, baby.
[02:28:54.520 --> 02:28:57.520]  Are you happy washing your hands with harsh chemicals?
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:28:59.520]  Are you happy doing laundry with detergents?
[02:28:59.520 --> 02:29:01.520]  Are you happy paying high prices?
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:03.520]  Find your happiness with pure soap.

[02:29:12.520 --> 02:29:15.520]  Or get items individually and still save big.
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:18.520]  You're getting soap products twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:20.520]  Earth-friendly and natural soaps.

[02:29:59.520 --> 02:30:02.520]  I'm going to spend a few minutes here first,
[02:30:02.520 --> 02:30:07.520]  just encouraging listeners to understand that when you buy t-shirts
[02:30:07.520 --> 02:30:10.520]  or water filtration systems or books or videos
[02:30:10.520 --> 02:30:14.520]  of other material from infowarsstore.com,
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:16.520]  you are funding the revolution.
[02:30:16.520 --> 02:30:18.520]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[02:30:18.520 --> 02:30:22.520]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarsstore.com.
[02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:24.520]  I don't want to thank everybody that has,
[02:30:24.520 --> 02:30:27.520]  but we've got the best fluoride-free toothpaste with colloidal silver
[02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:29.520]  and with high-quality atomic iodine.
[02:30:29.520 --> 02:30:32.520]  I think you cannot beat that for children and adults.
[02:30:32.520 --> 02:30:34.520]  We've got the best mouthwash designed by Dr. Jones.
[02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:37.520]  That's my dad with colloidal silver and iodine as well.
[02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:41.520]  That's infowarslife.com or AAA-253-3139.

[02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:46.520]  stands with America, stands with Trump,
[02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:49.520]  stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile armies.
[02:30:49.520 --> 02:30:51.520]  And that's who they are and they know we know who they are
[02:30:51.520 --> 02:31:20.520]  and they're coming back against us so we need your support.
[02:31:21.520 --> 02:31:24.520]  While shooting hoops, the last thing I want is sweaty armpits
[02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:27.520]  making my hands slippery and the ball wet.
[02:31:27.520 --> 02:31:31.520]  That's why I recommend EmRick's Essentials fragrance-free deodorant.
[02:31:31.520 --> 02:31:35.520]  Even though it's unscented, it's effective at combating strong body odor

[02:31:58.520 --> 02:32:00.520]  Oh Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[02:32:00.520 --> 02:32:03.520]  Thank you sir for doing what you do and being a patriot
[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:07.520]  and doing your best to save America and encouraging us as fellow patriots
[02:32:07.520 --> 02:32:10.520]  to do that in our local areas as well.
[02:32:10.520 --> 02:32:13.520]  And as a longtime Infowars listener,
[02:32:13.520 --> 02:32:16.520]  I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[02:32:16.520 --> 02:32:20.520]  Anthroplex, my girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex too.
[02:32:20.520 --> 02:32:21.520]  Thank you.
[02:32:21.520 --> 02:32:24.520]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste for you folks
[02:32:24.520 --> 02:32:26.520]  who aren't big normal toothpaste fans.
[02:32:26.520 --> 02:32:28.520]  The super blue is awesome.
[02:32:28.520 --> 02:32:31.520]  And thank you so much Alex for the Infowars Life products.
[02:32:31.520 --> 02:32:34.520]  They are quality. I can't wait to get some more.
[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:37.520]  And thank you so much for doing that for us to keep us healthy.
[02:32:37.520 --> 02:32:38.520]  Absolutely.
[02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:40.520]  Because then we could all as educated patriots
[02:32:40.520 --> 02:32:43.520]  help our other countrymen and women
[02:32:43.520 --> 02:32:46.520]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on
[02:32:46.520 --> 02:32:48.520]  and if we can get our houses in order
[02:32:48.520 --> 02:33:17.520]  to be good to each other and ourselves, we can take our country back.
[02:33:19.520 --> 02:33:22.520]  Defending the Republic from enemies,
[02:33:22.520 --> 02:33:24.520]  foreign and domestic.
[02:33:24.520 --> 02:33:26.520]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:28.520]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:33:28.520 --> 02:33:38.520]  Broadcasting worldwide from the Infowars.com studios.
[02:33:38.520 --> 02:33:41.520]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:41.520 --> 02:33:44.520]  I'm Arlene Oppelis, standing in for Alex,
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:46.520]  but also accompanied by Alex,
[02:33:46.520 --> 02:33:49.520]  my glamorous and intrepid chief investigative reporter
[02:33:49.520 --> 02:33:51.520]  for the hour, Alex Jones.
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:52.520]  Welcome to the show.
[02:33:52.520 --> 02:33:56.520]  And Alex has been digging into the inconsistencies.
[02:33:56.520 --> 02:34:00.520]  I think the best way to describe this is a strange smell.
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:02.520]  There is a strange smell.
[02:34:02.520 --> 02:34:03.520]  The stink.
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:05.520]  The stench of something weird.
[02:34:05.520 --> 02:34:06.520]  The stink.
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:07.520]  The stink.
[02:34:07.520 --> 02:34:09.520]  The taint.
[02:34:09.520 --> 02:34:11.520]  You're like a walking thesaurus.
[02:34:11.520 --> 02:34:12.520]  I love it.
[02:34:12.520 --> 02:34:15.520]  There's something weird about the tweets
[02:34:15.520 --> 02:34:18.520]  from the four kids who have been wheeled out
[02:34:18.520 --> 02:34:22.520]  to repeat anti-gun talking points in the media.
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:24.520]  And Alex has been digging down into what exactly is going on.
[02:34:24.520 --> 02:34:26.520]  I'm going to hand over to him now.
[02:34:26.520 --> 02:34:29.520]  He has a guest on who's going to shed some more light on the situation.
[02:34:29.520 --> 02:34:30.520]  That's right.
[02:34:30.520 --> 02:34:32.520]  We're lining up that young man who's been on before
[02:34:32.520 --> 02:34:34.520]  and who goes up with his friends and says,
[02:34:34.520 --> 02:34:36.520]  we're ready to, we're pro-gun, we're ready to tell you what we saw.
[02:34:36.520 --> 02:34:38.520]  And they go, oh, no, no, thank you.
[02:34:38.520 --> 02:34:41.520]  You mean CNN didn't find time to express his view?
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:43.520]  CNN did not talk to this young man
[02:34:43.520 --> 02:34:46.520]  who is on his way home before he calls us.
[02:34:46.520 --> 02:34:48.520]  I thought they were fair and impartial.
[02:34:48.520 --> 02:34:51.520]  I thought we were going to have a range of views in their town.
[02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:52.520]  No, they're not.
[02:34:52.520 --> 02:34:54.520]  So let's just review before we get into the other evidence,
[02:34:54.520 --> 02:34:56.520]  these other clips we haven't gotten to before he joins us.
[02:34:56.520 --> 02:34:58.520]  Let's just review.
[02:34:58.520 --> 02:35:01.520]  I get up yesterday and today, and the headlines are,
[02:35:01.520 --> 02:35:04.520]  Trump has created an atmosphere where they're saying
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:09.520]  no one was shot in Florida and where children are being attacked.
[02:35:09.520 --> 02:35:11.520]  And then you go read what they're attacking,
[02:35:11.520 --> 02:35:13.520]  Jim Hoff, the Gateway Pundit.
[02:35:13.520 --> 02:35:15.520]  He's like, well, this kid's mom's a big Democrat.
[02:35:15.520 --> 02:35:17.520]  He gets these VIP visits to all these places.
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:19.520]  His mom's involved in all this anti-gun stuff.
[02:35:19.520 --> 02:35:20.520]  So is his dad.
[02:35:20.520 --> 02:35:22.520]  His dad's former FBI.
[02:35:22.520 --> 02:35:26.520]  And why is it only the four kids out of the 3,000
[02:35:26.520 --> 02:35:28.520]  at the school that we keep seeing everywhere,
[02:35:28.520 --> 02:35:32.520]  obviously all saying classic anti-gun slogans.
[02:35:32.520 --> 02:35:35.520]  We're not anti-gun, just ban them all and do something.
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:37.520]  Not one more of us left can die.
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:39.520]  And all of you that don't do what we say,
[02:35:39.520 --> 02:35:41.520]  you're causing our death.
[02:35:41.520 --> 02:35:45.520]  I mean, this goes, so again, it's only these four students
[02:35:45.520 --> 02:35:49.520]  over and over and over and over and over and over.
[02:35:49.520 --> 02:35:53.520]  So that right there means they're skewing in the media
[02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:54.520]  what's being said and done.
[02:35:54.520 --> 02:35:56.520]  Then he goes on and says, I'm not a crisis actor.
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:35:58.520]  We're not saying you're a crisis actor.
[02:35:58.520 --> 02:35:59.520]  I don't know anyone that is saying it.
[02:35:59.520 --> 02:36:00.520]  Jim Hoff is not saying it.
[02:36:00.520 --> 02:36:02.520]  Info wars is not saying it.
[02:36:02.520 --> 02:36:03.520]  You're not saying it.
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:06.520]  What we're saying is, don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[02:36:06.520 --> 02:36:08.520]  Rahm Emanuel, the clip we played earlier,
[02:36:08.520 --> 02:36:10.520]  Hillary Clinton saying the same thing.
[02:36:10.520 --> 02:36:13.520]  They're clearly seizing on this, blaming all gun owners
[02:36:13.520 --> 02:36:16.520]  when the big story is all the early warnings were there.
[02:36:16.520 --> 02:36:18.520]  His girlfriend said he was going to kill everybody.
[02:36:18.520 --> 02:36:19.520]  They warned people.
[02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:20.520]  We've had guests on that called the FBI.
[02:36:20.520 --> 02:36:21.520]  Nothing was done.
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:23.520]  They totally changed the subject away from that
[02:36:23.520 --> 02:36:25.520]  when crazy people are running around
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:28.520]  and they say it's all our fault, Milo.
[02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:31.520]  That right there is outrageous that we're being blamed for this
[02:36:31.520 --> 02:36:32.520]  and it makes me angry.
[02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:35.520]  One of the most effective forms of political,
[02:36:35.520 --> 02:36:38.520]  of weaponizing these tragedies is identifying villains
[02:36:38.520 --> 02:36:40.520]  and victims.
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:42.520]  And so it was very...
[02:36:42.520 --> 02:36:43.520]  The VV.
[02:36:43.520 --> 02:36:47.520]  It was very important for activists to take the streets,
[02:36:47.520 --> 02:36:49.520]  Democrat politicians to take the streets,
[02:36:49.520 --> 02:36:50.520]  celebrities to take the streets
[02:36:50.520 --> 02:36:52.520]  and immediately identify the villains,
[02:36:52.520 --> 02:36:55.520]  not as the shooter, but as the NRA,
[02:36:55.520 --> 02:36:58.520]  Trump, anybody who likes guns,
[02:36:58.520 --> 02:37:00.520]  anybody who may ever have voted Republican.
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:02.520]  And now they have huge billboards still up
[02:37:02.520 --> 02:37:04.520]  for now six days saying kill NRA reporters.
[02:37:04.520 --> 02:37:05.520]  Right.
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:07.520]  Or kill NRA supporters.
[02:37:07.520 --> 02:37:09.520]  And then that's allowed to stay up
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:11.520]  in this total climate of violence.
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:13.520]  And what you've noticed is the transposition.
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:15.520]  I mean, the guy who actually did this shooting
[02:37:15.520 --> 02:37:17.520]  was a crazy kid.
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:19.520]  He was on antidepressant medication.
[02:37:19.520 --> 02:37:20.520]  Wouldn't it have been more logical?
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:21.520]  By the way, resist 45.
[02:37:21.520 --> 02:37:22.520]  That is anti.
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:23.520]  For the ones that kill cops.
[02:37:23.520 --> 02:37:24.520]  Sorry.
[02:37:24.520 --> 02:37:26.520]  No, I mean, this guy is on medication.
[02:37:26.520 --> 02:37:27.520]  He's crazy.
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:29.520]  He's got no mom, all the rest of it.
[02:37:29.520 --> 02:37:31.520]  You could have chosen him.
[02:37:31.520 --> 02:37:33.520]  You could have chosen Big Pharma.
[02:37:33.520 --> 02:37:36.520]  You could have chosen many of the elements
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:38.520]  that were actually responsible for this tragedy.
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:40.520]  You could have chosen, dare I say it?
[02:37:40.520 --> 02:37:41.520]  Wait for it.
[02:37:41.520 --> 02:37:42.520]  Yes.
[02:37:42.520 --> 02:37:44.520]  The FBI for not acting on information they had.
[02:37:44.520 --> 02:37:46.520]  Nobody suggesting the FBI has manufactured
[02:37:46.520 --> 02:37:47.520]  the deaths of children.
[02:37:47.520 --> 02:37:49.520]  Yeah, we don't even want to go that far.
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:51.520]  But if you want to start saying who's to blame,
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:52.520]  he's on psychotropic.
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:54.520]  He has no parents, foster care.
[02:37:54.520 --> 02:37:56.520]  He's telling everyone he's going to kill people.
[02:37:56.520 --> 02:37:58.520]  He calls himself the school shooter for two years.
[02:37:58.520 --> 02:38:00.520]  The warnings go in and nothing's done.
[02:38:00.520 --> 02:38:04.520]  And you've got the liberal Democrat school standing down,
[02:38:04.520 --> 02:38:07.520]  waiting with a whole bevy of student actors
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:09.520]  who aren't involved, but are wound up,
[02:38:09.520 --> 02:38:12.520]  scripted and prepared to go public
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:14.520]  and put out the anti-gun line.
[02:38:14.520 --> 02:38:16.520]  And there's a subtlety here that it's important to grasp.
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:19.520]  Nobody that I know, no reasonable person I know
[02:38:19.520 --> 02:38:20.520]  is saying this was a setup.
[02:38:20.520 --> 02:38:22.520]  It didn't happen in the kids or actors.
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:23.520]  No, school shootings happen.
[02:38:23.520 --> 02:38:24.520]  There are evil people.
[02:38:24.520 --> 02:38:25.520]  Nobody's saying that.
[02:38:25.520 --> 02:38:26.520]  But the media says we're saying it.
[02:38:26.520 --> 02:38:29.520]  They say that many of us are saying it.
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:31.520]  But there is a, there's a more subtle distinction.
[02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:32.520]  Nobody's saying, you know, the FBI,
[02:38:32.520 --> 02:38:34.520]  this is a setup by the FBI.
[02:38:34.520 --> 02:38:35.520]  But what people are asking is,
[02:38:35.520 --> 02:38:37.520]  if the FBI had all this information,
[02:38:37.520 --> 02:38:41.520]  is there perhaps a sort of general tendency
[02:38:41.520 --> 02:38:42.520]  among the FBI because-
[02:38:42.520 --> 02:38:43.520]  To let it happen.
[02:38:43.520 --> 02:38:46.520]  Their purpose is not to aggressively investigate
[02:38:46.520 --> 02:38:48.520]  and get these people off the streets.
[02:38:48.520 --> 02:38:49.520]  You just said it.
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:50.520]  Let me devastate the whole thing.
[02:38:50.520 --> 02:38:54.520]  CBS reporter Shull Atkinson releases the documents.
[02:38:54.520 --> 02:38:56.520]  The ATF agents are like, why are we doing this?
[02:38:56.520 --> 02:38:57.520]  We're getting thousands killed.
[02:38:57.520 --> 02:38:59.520]  They said, we're gonna blame it on the gun owners
[02:38:59.520 --> 02:39:00.520]  and take the guns.
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:04.520]  We have them confirm killing thousands and thousands,
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:05.520]  hundreds confirm.
[02:39:05.520 --> 02:39:07.520]  You know, it's thousands, hundreds of Mexicans
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:09.520]  with illegal guns at the government ordered gun shops
[02:39:09.520 --> 02:39:11.520]  to allow to be sold, shipped to Mexico
[02:39:11.520 --> 02:39:13.520]  to then track them back and blame the Second Amendment.
[02:39:13.520 --> 02:39:15.520]  Show if they would turn to blind eye
[02:39:15.520 --> 02:39:18.520]  and say commit crime to actually grease the skids
[02:39:18.520 --> 02:39:21.520]  to blame gun owners, would they do that here?
[02:39:21.520 --> 02:39:23.520]  I mean, with what we already know
[02:39:23.520 --> 02:39:26.520]  about the political attitudes of FBI agents,
[02:39:26.520 --> 02:39:28.520]  those texts about Trump, you know,
[02:39:28.520 --> 02:39:31.520]  the extent to which the FBI had been compromised
[02:39:31.520 --> 02:39:33.520]  by the Clinton machine and by the Democrats more generally
[02:39:33.520 --> 02:39:35.520]  at the highest levels.
[02:39:35.520 --> 02:39:38.520]  Is it so beyond the realms of possibility
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:41.520]  that there was a general feeling in the FBI,
[02:39:41.520 --> 02:39:45.520]  you know, possibly even stretching to the status of policy
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:47.520]  not to aggressively investigate
[02:39:47.520 --> 02:39:49.520]  and to remove these dangers from the streets?
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:52.520]  Because let's face it, the fewer guns are in the hands
[02:39:52.520 --> 02:39:56.520]  of law-abiding, gun-toting, freedom-loving American citizens,
[02:39:56.520 --> 02:39:58.520]  the more power the government had.
[02:39:58.520 --> 02:40:00.520]  And by the way, your equation, because I meant to make
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:02.520]  that point, Mylon, I'm glad you brought that up,
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:03.520]  is the fast and furious.
[02:40:03.520 --> 02:40:05.520]  If they've done it before, they'll do it again.
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:06.520]  They did it another time.
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:08.520]  Sam Bernardino, they killed a bunch of people
[02:40:08.520 --> 02:40:09.520]  at the Christmas party.
[02:40:09.520 --> 02:40:12.520]  The FBI agents at grassroots level,
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:14.520]  they tried to do their job at ground level
[02:40:14.520 --> 02:40:15.520]  with the federal marshals.
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:17.520]  They were criminally investigated
[02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:18.520]  for civil rights violations.
[02:40:18.520 --> 02:40:20.520]  We're facing criminal charges
[02:40:20.520 --> 02:40:22.520]  because they wanted to spy on the mosque
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:24.520]  after the husband and wife went to Pakistan
[02:40:24.520 --> 02:40:26.520]  and Saudi Arabia for the first time
[02:40:26.520 --> 02:40:28.520]  and the Imam was preaching violence.
[02:40:28.520 --> 02:40:31.520]  Then two years later, we learned they went back and forth.
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:34.520]  The attack happens, and it was the FBI that actually leaked it.
[02:40:34.520 --> 02:40:36.520]  Hey, we tried to stop this.
[02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:38.520]  We were ordered to stand down
[02:40:38.520 --> 02:40:40.520]  because they did the equation the Democrats did.
[02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:42.520]  Let them kill a bunch of people with guns.
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:45.520]  We'll just say it's not Islamic like they did the first week.
[02:40:45.520 --> 02:40:46.520]  We'll just blame guns.
[02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:47.520]  Remember the first four or five days
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:49.520]  they were blaming guns saying,
[02:40:49.520 --> 02:40:51.520]  oh, it's not Islam when it was.
[02:40:51.520 --> 02:40:53.520]  So that didn't work for them, see?
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:55.520]  But exactly, they ordered to stand down
[02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:57.520]  of a violent mosque planning terror attacks,
[02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:59.520]  reportedly, people in the mosque planning it
[02:40:59.520 --> 02:41:01.520]  because they wanted that event to take place.
[02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:02.520]  My love.
[02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:04.520]  Look at Omar Mateen, the Pulse nightclub shooting.
[02:41:04.520 --> 02:41:05.520]  You know, it was...
[02:41:05.520 --> 02:41:06.520]  FBI informant.
[02:41:06.520 --> 02:41:07.520]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:08.520]  You're totally protected.
[02:41:08.520 --> 02:41:10.520]  The dad is mercenary.
[02:41:10.520 --> 02:41:11.520]  The background at Hillary rallies,
[02:41:11.520 --> 02:41:12.520]  you know, the rest of it.
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:13.520]  This well...
[02:41:13.520 --> 02:41:14.520]  Lord again?
[02:41:14.520 --> 02:41:16.520]  Well, well known to the authorities.
[02:41:16.520 --> 02:41:18.520]  49, I mean, the liberals should have been leaping on this.
[02:41:18.520 --> 02:41:21.520]  You know, to protect their precious victimhood class.
[02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:22.520]  It wasn't just gays.
[02:41:22.520 --> 02:41:23.520]  It was Hispanic gays.
[02:41:23.520 --> 02:41:26.520]  It was quite far up the oppression hierarchy, you know?
[02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:29.520]  Hispanic gay people are pretty high up in the left,
[02:41:29.520 --> 02:41:31.520]  you know, favorite category, whatever.
[02:41:31.520 --> 02:41:34.520]  Did they aggressively investigate, you know,
[02:41:34.520 --> 02:41:36.520]  the causes of whatever, whatever, did they...
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:38.520]  No, clearly, there's a stand down...
[02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:40.520]  Sanford, you know, there was a mosque in Sanford
[02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:42.520]  with this guy who said there was an Imam
[02:41:42.520 --> 02:41:44.520]  who had spoken at the mosque in Sanford
[02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:46.520]  who said the compassionate thing to do about gays
[02:41:46.520 --> 02:41:48.520]  was to kill them all.
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:49.520]  And this was the mosque...
[02:41:49.520 --> 02:41:50.520]  That was his Imam.
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:52.520]  This was the mosque that Omar Mateem was going to.
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:53.520]  And his father agreed with that later.
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:56.520]  But no, the problem was gun control and toxic masculinity.
[02:41:56.520 --> 02:41:57.520]  Take Islam out of the equation
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:41:59.520]  and just use it to bash men, bash guns.
[02:41:59.520 --> 02:42:00.520]  Wow, wow.
[02:42:00.520 --> 02:42:01.520]  We're gonna come right back.
[02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:03.520]  We've got Jalen Martin, a senior at Marjory Stoneman,
[02:42:03.520 --> 02:42:05.520]  Douglas Hyde, he's Pro Second Amendment,
[02:42:05.520 --> 02:42:06.520]  very open-minded,
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:07.520]  and the media doesn't want to talk to him.
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:09.520]  I talked to him about an hour and a half ago.
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:12.520]  He has got unbelievable revelations
[02:42:12.520 --> 02:42:14.520]  about what's happening behind the scenes when we come back.
[02:42:14.520 --> 02:42:17.520]  Just briefly, we've got it in this special.
[02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:18.520]  We've got to sell a ton of it
[02:42:18.520 --> 02:42:19.520]  to be able to find the operation.
[02:42:19.520 --> 02:42:21.520]  What we do is it's such great toothpaste,
[02:42:21.520 --> 02:42:22.520]  four to five of colloidal silver,
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:25.520]  and Nathan Iadine's Super Blue is 50% off,
[02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:27.520]  but it has got to end today.
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:29.520]  When I come back in tomorrow,
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:30.520]  there's gonna be new specials,
[02:42:30.520 --> 02:42:34.520]  25% off Rainforest, the Liber and Kidney Cleanser,
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:36.520]  Icaron, oh my gosh, 50% off.
[02:42:36.520 --> 02:42:37.520]  Cell 4 is 53% off.
[02:42:37.520 --> 02:42:38.520]  It's all got to end.
[02:42:38.520 --> 02:42:39.520]  I've been so slamming and busy.
[02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:41.520]  I have not gotten rid of these specials
[02:42:41.520 --> 02:42:43.520]  despite the fact it's all about to sell out.
[02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:44.520]  I don't want to just sell out.
[02:42:44.520 --> 02:42:45.520]  I'm gonna go back to regular price
[02:42:45.520 --> 02:42:46.520]  when more comes in.
[02:42:46.520 --> 02:42:48.520]  So we've got a lot of new specials coming up.
[02:42:48.520 --> 02:42:49.520]  Take advantage of those now.
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:50.520]  You are funding the Info War
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:52.520]  and the defense of the Republic.
[02:42:52.520 --> 02:42:54.520]  So your funding is vital.
[02:42:54.520 --> 02:42:56.520]  Info War's Life is bringing you
[02:42:56.520 --> 02:42:58.520]  a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[02:42:58.520 --> 02:43:00.520]  We have found extraordinary new natural way
[02:43:00.520 --> 02:43:03.520]  to help alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:43:03.520 --> 02:43:05.520]  including promoting clear nasal
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:07.520]  and sinus passageways, eye comfort,
[02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:09.520]  and respiratory health, and normal breathing.
[02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:11.520]  This is pollen block.
[02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:13.520]  In the 1960s researchers in France
[02:43:13.520 --> 02:43:16.520]  noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs
[02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:18.520]  from specific farms experienced
[02:43:18.520 --> 02:43:20.520]  less seasonal distress symptoms
[02:43:20.520 --> 02:43:22.520]  like runny nose, itchy watery eyes,
[02:43:22.520 --> 02:43:24.520]  and excessive mucus production.
[02:43:24.520 --> 02:43:26.520]  They began studying the effects
[02:43:26.520 --> 02:43:28.520]  in published trials, in their published trials.
[02:43:28.520 --> 02:43:31.520]  Now we are introducing the fruit of the research,
[02:43:31.520 --> 02:43:33.520]  a fast-acting chewable tablet,
[02:43:33.520 --> 02:43:36.520]  just two tablets at the first sign
[02:43:36.520 --> 02:43:37.520]  of seasonal distress,
[02:43:37.520 --> 02:43:39.520]  and fast-acting pollen block
[02:43:39.520 --> 02:43:41.520]  starts working in about 15 minutes
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:43.520]  to help alleviate seasonal distress.
[02:43:43.520 --> 02:43:45.520]  Enjoy the air you breathe naturally
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:47.520]  with fast-acting pollen block,

[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:24.520]  Top scientists agree that aging
[02:44:24.520 --> 02:44:27.520]  is most likely caused by cellular damage,
[02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:30.520]  resulting from these reactive oxygen species.
[02:44:30.520 --> 02:44:32.520]  The antioxidants found in cell force
[02:44:32.520 --> 02:44:35.520]  are some of the most powerful available on the market.
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:37.520]  The stronger the antioxidant,
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:39.520]  the better its ability to scavenge
[02:44:39.520 --> 02:44:41.520]  for these reactive oxygen species
[02:44:41.520 --> 02:44:43.520]  and other free radicals.

[02:44:56.520 --> 02:44:58.520]  Introducing Fluorolife,
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:00.520]  the new probiotic line developed exclusively
[02:45:00.520 --> 02:45:02.520]  by InfoWarsLife after years of research
[02:45:02.520 --> 02:45:04.520]  on the human microbiome.
[02:45:04.520 --> 02:45:06.520]  Not all probiotics are made the same.
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:08.520]  Fluorolife probiotics use a unique
[02:45:08.520 --> 02:45:11.520]  targeted delivery system that bypasses the stomach
[02:45:11.520 --> 02:45:13.520]  and releases directly into the intestines
[02:45:13.520 --> 02:45:15.520]  for maximum effect.
[02:45:15.520 --> 02:45:17.520]  This is critical because stomach acid
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:19.520]  is most probiotics,
[02:45:19.520 --> 02:45:21.520]  so if you don't have a targeted delivery probiotic,
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:23.520]  then you're cheating your gut health and your wallet.
[02:45:23.520 --> 02:45:25.520]  Fluorolife supports your body's core,
[02:45:25.520 --> 02:45:27.520]  where you need it most,
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:29.520]  including digestion, regularity, immunity,
[02:45:29.520 --> 02:45:31.520]  the gut lining, and metabolism.
[02:45:31.520 --> 02:45:33.520]  Did you know that over 80% of your immune system
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:35.520]  is located in your gut?
[02:45:35.520 --> 02:45:37.520]  That's why increasing gut probiotic levels
[02:45:37.520 --> 02:45:39.520]  is so important for overall health.
[02:45:39.520 --> 02:45:41.520]  Fluorolife is sold as a 15-billion probiotic
[02:45:41.520 --> 02:45:43.520]  for everyday maintenance care
[02:45:43.520 --> 02:45:45.520]  and a 50-billion probiotic
[02:45:45.520 --> 02:45:47.520]  for a 30-day advanced gut restoration program.

[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:31.520]  the products that you need each month.

[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:03.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:03.520 --> 02:47:05.520]  Let's get started.
[02:47:33.520 --> 02:47:35.520]  Let's try and have a debate here.
[02:47:35.520 --> 02:47:37.520]  Yeah.
[02:47:37.520 --> 02:47:39.520]  Answer me this question.
[02:47:39.520 --> 02:47:41.520]  I'm sick of the same old script here, bud.
[02:47:41.520 --> 02:47:43.520]  That was back in 2013.
[02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:45.520]  Milo in Opel is riding shotgun
[02:47:45.520 --> 02:47:47.520]  with me here in studio.
[02:47:47.520 --> 02:47:49.520]  We're about to go to one of the survivors,
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:51.520]  Jalen Martin of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School,
[02:47:51.520 --> 02:47:53.520]  who the media is not interviewing
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:55.520]  of the 3,000 students.
[02:47:55.520 --> 02:47:57.520]  It's four people they're talking to
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:47:59.520]  who are all anti-gun acolytes.
[02:47:59.520 --> 02:48:01.520]  But here's the big question everybody's asking.
[02:48:01.520 --> 02:48:05.520]  Were there crisis actors used there?
[02:48:05.520 --> 02:48:07.520]  Because the Democrats have been caught
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:09.520]  for anti-fun democratic events,
[02:48:09.520 --> 02:48:11.520]  putting up ads, paying up to $50 an hour
[02:48:11.520 --> 02:48:13.520]  for crisis actors,
[02:48:13.520 --> 02:48:15.520]  people that are part of government drills,
[02:48:15.520 --> 02:48:17.520]  you name it, to come out and be part of demonstrations.
[02:48:17.520 --> 02:48:19.520]  I don't think the evidence points towards that,
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:21.520]  but the media is using that,
[02:48:21.520 --> 02:48:23.520]  even though we're not saying,
[02:48:23.520 --> 02:48:25.520]  and others aren't saying it, to distract away from
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:27.520]  the four students they are focusing on out of 3,000,
[02:48:27.520 --> 02:48:29.520]  are doing that.
[02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:31.520]  We're talking about a 3,000.
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:33.520]  Are Democratic Party members,
[02:48:33.520 --> 02:48:35.520]  their parents are, they're anti-gunners,
[02:48:35.520 --> 02:48:37.520]  and they are, because they're in the drama department,
[02:48:37.520 --> 02:48:39.520]  the journalism department, spouting these
[02:48:39.520 --> 02:48:41.520]  talking points.
[02:48:41.520 --> 02:48:43.520]  So yes, they're political mouthpieces
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:45.520]  repeating things,
[02:48:45.520 --> 02:48:47.520]  and so they're operative,
[02:48:47.520 --> 02:48:49.520]  so we have a right to simply counter
[02:48:49.520 --> 02:48:51.520]  their political speech.
[02:48:51.520 --> 02:48:53.520]  They're in an adult's world, we're not attacking young people,
[02:48:53.520 --> 02:48:55.520]  we're not saying there wasn't a mass shooting, none of that.
[02:48:55.520 --> 02:48:57.520]  Milo, we're about to go to Jalen Martin,
[02:48:57.520 --> 02:48:59.520]  but what is your view on that?
[02:48:59.520 --> 02:49:01.520]  Because that's what the media is trying to do, like,
[02:49:01.520 --> 02:49:03.520]  Trump and his son said nobody was shot there.
[02:49:03.520 --> 02:49:05.520]  Well, this is a typical example
[02:49:05.520 --> 02:49:07.520]  of what happens after one of these
[02:49:07.520 --> 02:49:09.520]  shootings.
[02:49:09.520 --> 02:49:11.520]  First of all, the villain is
[02:49:11.520 --> 02:49:13.520]  transferred or relocated,
[02:49:13.520 --> 02:49:15.520]  so they've relocated it from the guy who actually
[02:49:15.520 --> 02:49:17.520]  did it to
[02:49:17.520 --> 02:49:19.520]  gun owners, Republicans, Trump supporters,
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:21.520]  and whatever. And now because they question
[02:49:21.520 --> 02:49:23.520]  the politicization of it, now you're victimizing
[02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:25.520]  children, even though these young adults
[02:49:25.520 --> 02:49:27.520]  are obviously scripted
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:29.520]  in the combine and spouting
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:31.520]  Democrat talking points.
[02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:33.520]  And look at what happens when it doesn't quite go
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:35.520]  as they were hoping, and look at the way
[02:49:35.520 --> 02:49:37.520]  in which they distract attention. Jordan Peterson,
[02:49:37.520 --> 02:49:39.520]  for instance, is a famous professor
[02:49:39.520 --> 02:49:41.520]  who floored
[02:49:41.520 --> 02:49:43.520]  a channel for interviewer, Kathy Newman, in the UK.
[02:49:43.520 --> 02:49:45.520]  He destroyed her. We played the clip, he said,
[02:49:45.520 --> 02:49:47.520]  you're attacking me, you disagree with me,
[02:49:47.520 --> 02:49:49.520]  you're making me uncomfortable. How can I say
[02:49:49.520 --> 02:49:51.520]  there's only men and women chromosomally,
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:53.520]  if that hurts people's feelings? Sorry, that's what life's
[02:49:53.520 --> 02:49:55.520]  like. She goes, I can't answer you.
[02:49:55.520 --> 02:49:57.520]  It was devastating.
[02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:59.520]  So what was the story about? Within 24 hours
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:01.520]  mean tweets Kathy was getting.
[02:50:01.520 --> 02:50:03.520]  It was misdirection. Changing the story up.
[02:50:03.520 --> 02:50:05.520]  People are bullying her now.
[02:50:05.520 --> 02:50:07.520]  Changing the story up to prove
[02:50:07.520 --> 02:50:09.520]  some other part of leftist orthodoxy.
[02:50:09.520 --> 02:50:11.520]  Well, what's happening with this is very clearly,
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:13.520]  very obviously, the left
[02:50:13.520 --> 02:50:15.520]  media, which is bruised and battered
[02:50:15.520 --> 02:50:17.520]  and beaten and so humiliated
[02:50:17.520 --> 02:50:19.520]  by the Trump's election, is seeking
[02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:21.520]  to establish its legitimacy by calling
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:23.520]  into question, you know, ordinary
[02:50:23.520 --> 02:50:25.520]  people's opinions, by laughing at people
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:27.520]  being conspiracy theorists, by demeaning
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:29.520]  and belittling and calling names to anybody
[02:50:29.520 --> 02:50:31.520]  who does not support their... Well, that's what
[02:50:31.520 --> 02:50:33.520]  they said. They said that by Trump allowing
[02:50:33.520 --> 02:50:35.520]  questions of events and saying CNN lies
[02:50:35.520 --> 02:50:37.520]  sometimes, he's open it up to say no one
[02:50:37.520 --> 02:50:39.520]  died. No, you're a bunch of liars.
[02:50:39.520 --> 02:50:41.520]  You're the reason no one believes what you say.
[02:50:41.520 --> 02:50:43.520]  We're probably sure people did die there.
[02:50:43.520 --> 02:50:45.520]  We didn't do this to CNN. CNN did
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:47.520]  it when CNN purposefully lied
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:49.520]  to its viewers. When it brings, when it busses
[02:50:49.520 --> 02:50:51.520]  in protesters and there's a photo of them
[02:50:51.520 --> 02:50:53.520]  corraling protesters into the shot,
[02:50:53.520 --> 02:50:55.520]  you know, CNN stages things.
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:50:57.520]  They did it to themselves. We didn't do it to them.
[02:50:57.520 --> 02:50:59.520]  But look how quickly the story has now changed from
[02:50:59.520 --> 02:51:01.520]  the gun thing. Now they've got the march
[02:51:01.520 --> 02:51:03.520]  in the organization and they think they got the narrative
[02:51:03.520 --> 02:51:05.520]  locked down and gun owners are on ABC
[02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:07.520]  or NBC dismantling
[02:51:07.520 --> 02:51:09.520]  their own weapons. Okay, we've won that. Now let's
[02:51:09.520 --> 02:51:11.520]  go for the juggernaut. Let's go for another victory.
[02:51:11.520 --> 02:51:13.520]  Let's give the right a bloody nose
[02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:15.520]  and call everybody... And say they attacked all the poor children.
[02:51:15.520 --> 02:51:17.520]  Call everybody asking questions, conspiracy
[02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:19.520]  favorites. But they won't talk to anybody like
[02:51:19.520 --> 02:51:21.520]  Jalen Martin, who is a senior there.
[02:51:21.520 --> 02:51:23.520]  Snopes, here's the story. Put up on infowars.com.
[02:51:23.520 --> 02:51:25.520]  Snopes puts out that he's not
[02:51:25.520 --> 02:51:27.520]  real. He calls them and they go, oh, we know you're real.
[02:51:27.520 --> 02:51:29.520]  We thought someone stole your identity.
[02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:31.520]  No, they were saying he was hundreds of miles away.
[02:51:31.520 --> 02:51:33.520]  So Jalen Martin, what is it like for you?
[02:51:33.520 --> 02:51:35.520]  I mean, you're in the school calendar.
[02:51:35.520 --> 02:51:37.520]  You're on the school's website. You
[02:51:37.520 --> 02:51:39.520]  sent us your ID before we had you on.
[02:51:39.520 --> 02:51:41.520]  But Snopes, run by George Soros,
[02:51:41.520 --> 02:51:43.520]  he comes out and actually says you
[02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:45.520]  are an actor hired by
[02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:47.520]  Snopes.com.
[02:51:47.520 --> 02:51:49.520]  So Jalen, tell us the latest
[02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:51.520]  developments and folks saying that you
[02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:53.520]  don't exist.
[02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:55.520]  Yeah.
[02:51:55.520 --> 02:51:57.520]  So it was the managing editor
[02:51:57.520 --> 02:51:59.520]  of Snopes.com.
[02:51:59.520 --> 02:52:01.520]  Weirdly enough, they're a fact
[02:52:01.520 --> 02:52:03.520]  checking type. But clearly
[02:52:03.520 --> 02:52:05.520]  they don't know how to fact check well.
[02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:07.520]  If they show
[02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:09.520]  me like being on school
[02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:11.520]  grounds, they probably say that this was
[02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:13.520]  photoshopped into something like that.
[02:52:13.520 --> 02:52:15.520]  You know, I emailed her because
[02:52:15.520 --> 02:52:17.520]  she gave a tweet out that
[02:52:17.520 --> 02:52:19.520]  basically
[02:52:19.520 --> 02:52:21.520]  if I am Jalen Martin,
[02:52:21.520 --> 02:52:23.520]  I'm lying or I just like travel
[02:52:23.520 --> 02:52:25.520]  there.
[02:52:25.520 --> 02:52:27.520]  I traveled really far just to come there for this,
[02:52:27.520 --> 02:52:29.520]  which is completely.
[02:52:29.520 --> 02:52:31.520]  Yeah, she said you live hundreds of miles away and you're a fraud.
[02:52:31.520 --> 02:52:33.520]  So you called her. Because I used to live in North Carolina
[02:52:33.520 --> 02:52:35.520]  and she saw a bio that I
[02:52:35.520 --> 02:52:37.520]  wrote a year ago for a site that
[02:52:37.520 --> 02:52:39.520]  I wrote.
[02:52:39.520 --> 02:52:41.520]  I wrote with a few people for it.
[02:52:41.520 --> 02:52:43.520]  But I, you know,
[02:52:43.520 --> 02:52:45.520]  I was trying to be professional. I emailed her back.
[02:52:45.520 --> 02:52:47.520]  I was like, okay, I should have changed this.
[02:52:47.520 --> 02:52:49.520]  But I don't necessarily want to exist.
[02:52:49.520 --> 02:52:51.520]  And she was like, oh yeah.
[02:52:51.520 --> 02:52:53.520]  I thought that someone took your identity.
[02:52:53.520 --> 02:52:55.520]  No, you did not. You're lying.
[02:52:55.520 --> 02:52:57.520]  She was lying so hard about that.
[02:52:57.520 --> 02:52:59.520]  She clearly did not think this was my identity.
[02:52:59.520 --> 02:53:01.520]  Who jumps to that conclusion?
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:03.520]  They're the ones saying that
[02:53:03.520 --> 02:53:05.520]  they're the ones saying don't question a victim
[02:53:05.520 --> 02:53:07.520]  when they're the ones that did it.
[02:53:07.520 --> 02:53:09.520]  Exactly.
[02:53:09.520 --> 02:53:11.520]  But as soon as someone appears on
[02:53:11.520 --> 02:53:13.520]  their rewards or has an opposing view
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:15.520]  to the one viewpoint that they're going to
[02:53:15.520 --> 02:53:17.520]  express tonight, which is
[02:53:17.520 --> 02:53:19.520]  getting control. I'm supposed to be going
[02:53:19.520 --> 02:53:21.520]  to the scene in Town Hall.
[02:53:21.520 --> 02:53:23.520]  So hopefully if they don't
[02:53:23.520 --> 02:53:25.520]  pre-screen questions
[02:53:25.520 --> 02:53:27.520]  like Donna Boussette or Hillary Clinton,
[02:53:27.520 --> 02:53:29.520]  then maybe I'll get
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:31.520]  to ask some real questions.
[02:53:31.520 --> 02:53:33.520]  Not some that I prepared on their card
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:35.520]  or that they prepared for me to ask.
[02:53:35.520 --> 02:53:37.520]  Who's disrespecting children more?
[02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:39.520]  Is it the public
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:41.520]  who see
[02:53:41.520 --> 02:53:43.520]  a young kid obviously
[02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:45.520]  reading from a pre-prepared script
[02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:47.520]  and call it like they see?
[02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.520]  Versus Jayleny. He doesn't sound like he's on some script.
[02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:51.520]  Versus Snopes.com
[02:53:51.520 --> 02:53:53.520]  who won't allow a student
[02:53:53.520 --> 02:53:55.520]  who was there. Am I not actually a student by the way?
[02:53:55.520 --> 02:53:57.520]  Who the left thought to be like,
[02:53:57.520 --> 02:53:59.520]  leaping out to put on television.
[02:53:59.520 --> 02:54:01.520]  Who has the wrong opinion about this stuff
[02:54:01.520 --> 02:54:03.520]  claiming that he is not who he is.
[02:54:03.520 --> 02:54:05.520]  Who's disrespecting kids?
[02:54:05.520 --> 02:54:07.520]  He doesn't even send his ID.
[02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:09.520]  But we went and looked. It's all in the school.
[02:54:09.520 --> 02:54:11.520]  There's pictures of him. He's all over the place there.
[02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.520]  They're just saying he's all made up.
[02:54:13.520 --> 02:54:15.520]  Oh, sorry. I thought somebody was...
[02:54:15.520 --> 02:54:17.520]  You could say that about anyone who has ever
[02:54:17.520 --> 02:54:19.520]  interviewed by any journalist ever.
[02:54:19.520 --> 02:54:21.520]  Oh, I'm sorry. So I thought somebody was...
[02:54:21.520 --> 02:54:23.520]  Well, here's the bombshell. Jaylen,
[02:54:23.520 --> 02:54:25.520]  because we talked about it two hours ago.
[02:54:25.520 --> 02:54:27.520]  There's a repeat number of little five-minute conversation
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:29.520]  in this segment of the next police room. We appreciate your time and your courage.
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:31.520]  You said that, you know, the mindset
[02:54:31.520 --> 02:54:33.520]  of people. You said media talks to you.
[02:54:33.520 --> 02:54:35.520]  They find out that you're not anti-guns.
[02:54:35.520 --> 02:54:37.520]  They want to talk to you. The town hall that's coming up.
[02:54:37.520 --> 02:54:39.520]  I mean, you dropped some big bombshells.
[02:54:39.520 --> 02:54:41.520]  The fact that you know,
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:43.520]  you know, David Hogg.
[02:54:43.520 --> 02:54:45.520]  I mean, please tell us about it all.
[02:54:45.520 --> 02:54:47.520]  Well, one thing that I was...
[02:54:47.520 --> 02:54:49.520]  I was about to come on.
[02:54:49.520 --> 02:54:51.520]  I was trying to go into depth to see
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:53.520]  if any of these four...
[02:54:53.520 --> 02:54:55.520]  I don't know what they went on.
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:54:57.520]  Fantastic four.
[02:54:57.520 --> 02:54:59.520]  Fantastic four.
[02:54:59.520 --> 02:55:01.520]  One of them, I think,
[02:55:01.520 --> 02:55:03.520]  is named Cameron Tasty.
[02:55:03.520 --> 02:55:05.520]  I am looking on the
[02:55:05.520 --> 02:55:07.520]  Douglas drama
[02:55:07.520 --> 02:55:09.520]  Twitter. Wait, you just named him.
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:11.520]  They're the fantastic four.
[02:55:11.520 --> 02:55:13.520]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:13.520 --> 02:55:15.520]  Not coincidentally,
[02:55:15.520 --> 02:55:17.520]  is the worst superhero movie of them all.
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:19.520]  I'm sorry. I apologize, Jaylen.
[02:55:19.520 --> 02:55:21.520]  It's the only crap superhero movie.
[02:55:21.520 --> 02:55:23.520]  Jaylen, you're pointing out they're in the drama class
[02:55:23.520 --> 02:55:25.520]  and they're in the journals class.
[02:55:25.520 --> 02:55:27.520]  Sorry, Jaylen. Keep going.
[02:55:27.520 --> 02:55:29.520]  So far.
[02:55:29.520 --> 02:55:31.520]  I'm confirming that, yes, Cameron Tasty
[02:55:31.520 --> 02:55:33.520]  is in the
[02:55:33.520 --> 02:55:35.520]  Douglas drama.
[02:55:35.520 --> 02:55:37.520]  So that's one down.
[02:55:37.520 --> 02:55:39.520]  Three more to go.
[02:55:39.520 --> 02:55:41.520]  But when I saw you over the break,
[02:55:41.520 --> 02:55:43.520]  basically, you know, I was at the vigil
[02:55:43.520 --> 02:55:45.520]  while I was taking pictures.
[02:55:45.520 --> 02:55:47.520]  He was like, oh, you're taking pictures
[02:55:47.520 --> 02:55:49.520]  or are you just doing that for pleasure?
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:51.520]  I'm not doing it for pleasure.
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:53.520]  But I'm taking pictures and playing for words.
[02:55:53.520 --> 02:55:55.520]  But oh, then he walked away immediately.
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:55:57.520]  Like, he knew that, okay,
[02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:59.520]  he's not the same.
[02:55:59.520 --> 02:56:01.520]  He looked like he wanted to talk to me more in depth,
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:03.520]  but now he didn't look at that.
[02:56:03.520 --> 02:56:05.520]  And also, this is one thing
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:07.520]  I didn't get to tell you during the break,
[02:56:07.520 --> 02:56:09.520]  the very next day I see the shooting
[02:56:09.520 --> 02:56:11.520]  I walked up to the school.
[02:56:11.520 --> 02:56:13.520]  There were, you know, a bunch of media there.
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:15.520]  And I had...
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:17.520]  I think this man was from Spain.
[02:56:17.520 --> 02:56:19.520]  He was a reporter.
[02:56:19.520 --> 02:56:21.520]  He was either from Spain or...
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:23.520]  I can't remember where he was from.
[02:56:23.520 --> 02:56:25.520]  But anyway, he was talking to me
[02:56:25.520 --> 02:56:27.520]  about someone I've ever done
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:29.520]  that was, like, young.
[02:56:29.520 --> 02:56:31.520]  He was like, aren't older people
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:33.520]  the ones who should have a gun?
[02:56:33.520 --> 02:56:35.520]  Don't you think that's pretty unusual
[02:56:35.520 --> 02:56:37.520]  if it's unusual in the sense that
[02:56:37.520 --> 02:56:39.520]  it doesn't happen all the time?
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:41.520]  But it's not unusual in the sense that
[02:56:41.520 --> 02:56:43.520]  people can't have guns if they're younger
[02:56:43.520 --> 02:56:45.520]  about protecting themselves.
[02:56:45.520 --> 02:56:47.520]  Sure. Jalen, Demi, a favor they're asking me.
[02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:49.520]  Back off your phone just a little bit.
[02:56:49.520 --> 02:56:51.520]  It's a little overdriven. Sorry, go ahead.
[02:56:51.520 --> 02:56:53.520]  Oh, yeah. Yeah.
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:56:55.520]  They're trying to push the narrative
[02:56:55.520 --> 02:56:57.520]  just within this country.
[02:56:57.520 --> 02:56:59.520]  This is all over the world.
[02:56:59.520 --> 02:57:01.520]  They're trying to push the same exact narrative over and over.
[02:57:01.520 --> 02:57:03.520]  Can I ask you a question?
[02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:05.520]  Putting aside the four...
[02:57:05.520 --> 02:57:07.520]  the Fantastic Four, which I love.
[02:57:07.520 --> 02:57:09.520]  That's the new thing.
[02:57:09.520 --> 02:57:11.520]  Isn't... I mean, it just
[02:57:11.520 --> 02:57:13.520]  struck me as more likely
[02:57:13.520 --> 02:57:15.520]  that kids who had just been through
[02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:17.520]  an experience like that
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:19.520]  would be really enthusiastically pro-gun.
[02:57:19.520 --> 02:57:21.520]  They'd be like, yeah, we want someone with a gun
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:23.520]  to take the gun.
[02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:25.520]  What's your estimation of the...
[02:57:25.520 --> 02:57:27.520]  Let's come back as Jalen's awesome witness
[02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:29.520]  breaking this down with his...
[02:57:29.520 --> 02:57:31.520]  he was a little too close to his phone.
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:33.520]  We're going to come back and give him the floor
[02:57:33.520 --> 02:57:35.520]  for this segment a little bit more if we need to.
[02:57:35.520 --> 02:57:37.520]  We'll have Hoff on about 15 after or so.
[02:57:37.520 --> 02:57:39.520]  But I wanted to be able to just...
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:41.520]  I should just shut up like I did earlier today
[02:57:41.520 --> 02:57:43.520]  and let him roll with all the stuff he witnessed,
[02:57:43.520 --> 02:57:45.520]  all the stuff he saw, and then get your take, Milo.
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:47.520]  I want to get Milo's great
[02:57:47.520 --> 02:57:49.520]  wit on this. We start the fourth hour right now.
[02:57:49.520 --> 02:57:51.520]  Let's get started.
[02:58:19.520 --> 02:58:21.520]  Over a year in the making...
[02:58:49.520 --> 02:58:55.120]  produced by one of the top organic firms in the country that if you want proven studies and
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:59:00.240]  documentation let me speak for hours this is on the files I have here of what this is proven to do
[02:59:00.240 --> 02:59:06.560]  the ingredients in this this is the ultimate immune system boost for this time of year anytime of
[02:59:06.560 --> 02:59:12.320]  the year but immune wall is incredible and folks other formulas that aren't even as good are 70
[02:59:12.320 --> 02:59:20.640]  80 it's a great deal at 39 immune wall beta-glucans olive leaf and so much more it is concentrated
[02:59:20.640 --> 02:59:26.400]  you need to go read what is in here the mushroom blend of the most expensive highest quality mushrooms
[02:59:26.400 --> 02:59:31.840]  that just incredibly accelerate a citrus peel blend I mean this is the next level it's now
[02:59:31.840 --> 02:59:37.040]  available ladies and gentlemen immune wall I think it's beyond seasonal beta-glucan olive leaf and
[02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:43.440]  more immune wall m4 store.com m4slime.com or triple 8 2533139
[02:59:49.520 --> 02:59:52.160]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[02:59:52.160 --> 03:00:08.400]  live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[03:00:08.400 --> 03:00:26.560]  all right I want to hear from Shailen Martin the Marjorie Stelman Douglas High School student
[03:00:26.560 --> 03:00:29.920]  about the incredible stuff behind the scenes we're getting this audio squared up he'll be
[03:00:29.920 --> 03:00:34.960]  almost about 15 minutes if you can still do it but Jim Hoft has been massively demonized from
[03:00:34.960 --> 03:00:41.040]  Gateway Pundit for a report put out by one of his reporters that simply pointed out that this
[03:00:41.040 --> 03:00:47.200]  David Hogg has become this big anti-gun activist in an adult's world his dad's an FBI agent that
[03:00:47.200 --> 03:00:55.280]  his mom is a anti-gunner big democrat and you've got this fantastic four that's only getting the
[03:00:55.280 --> 03:01:02.080]  attention over and over and over again these four students out of three thousand and so for me
[03:01:02.080 --> 03:01:07.840]  that's the issue is they're in drama they're in the media department they're they're they're trying
[03:01:07.840 --> 03:01:12.800]  to intern at CNN is that any way they knew each other wasn't it yes anyway these kids knew each
[03:01:12.800 --> 03:01:17.920]  other was was in the theater club and you're like yes that's completely reasonable because to go why
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:24.000]  are we being force-fed only these kids and not folks like the like Jalen Martin that we just had
[03:01:24.000 --> 03:01:28.480]  on it's easy to imagine you know how this all came together it's like well we got to find some
[03:01:28.480 --> 03:01:33.760]  kids who are on message let's see the drama kid I mean you you're trying to stop you you have to
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:38.640]  hold yourself back from putting all of these jigsaw pieces together because it's so obvious what
[03:01:38.640 --> 03:01:44.080]  happened well sure and then and then we're saying a mass shooting happened they go oh look you know
[03:01:44.080 --> 03:01:49.120]  all these the president says nothing happened well jim hop did to say that I didn't say that we have
[03:01:49.120 --> 03:01:54.720]  jim hop yet there he is there we are I can see him right there we're going he's got to go in like
[03:01:54.720 --> 03:01:59.760]  10 minutes is what we're trying to go to him so quick jim thanks for joining us uh wow what do you
[03:01:59.760 --> 03:02:07.200]  make of all this hi guys good to be with you uh you know it's it's uh it's unbelievable what's
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:14.000]  happening and uh we got a letter yesterday from one of the parents in the in the area there near
[03:02:14.000 --> 03:02:20.640]  parkland and he was saying that his son is pro trump and they called him and they called his son
[03:02:20.640 --> 03:02:26.080]  and his son told him to f off because he didn't want to participate in uh you know their their
[03:02:26.080 --> 03:02:31.920]  antics so of course this is all organized we know that and we also heard from the same father
[03:02:31.920 --> 03:02:37.280]  that they're not talking to any conservative kids at the school and so we've got a reporter on the
[03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:42.480]  ground most of them are basically libertarian they're open-minded or they're pro-gun but they're
[03:02:42.480 --> 03:02:48.320]  all scared they've been told don't go on television well there you go well they have they have who
[03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:56.240]  they want and uh we were the first ones to break that this uh kid uh the hog individual was uh
[03:02:56.240 --> 03:03:02.000]  his father's an fbi of course we know that the fbi screwed up completely with this story the fbi
[03:03:02.000 --> 03:03:06.640]  said they couldn't identify the shooter when they were tipped off by a youtuber and we know that's
[03:03:06.640 --> 03:03:13.840]  absolutely uh a lie because uh this this shooter used his real name on on youtube he used his real
[03:03:13.840 --> 03:03:19.120]  name on instagram this nicholas truce and he spelled it with a k i could have found it in three
[03:03:19.120 --> 03:03:26.240]  minutes you could have found it in four minutes um or two but um it was out there and but they
[03:03:26.240 --> 03:03:30.880]  didn't want to uh they didn't want to find this guy they didn't look for him and then we saw what
[03:03:30.880 --> 03:03:36.080]  happened and now they're blaming guns it's just nonsense anyway this this hog his father's with
[03:03:36.080 --> 03:03:42.640]  the fbi and then uh we we see that uh this video that they've taken down now on youtube you can't
[03:03:42.640 --> 03:03:48.160]  find it where it looks like he's practicing his lines so and we're being demonized oh that's the
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:54.560]  big one you just hit is they're pulling photos videos at cnn cbs there's an active expungement
[03:03:54.560 --> 03:04:03.600]  not just of uh pig uh uh hoggy but all these people did you just call him pig hoggy not on purpose
[03:04:03.600 --> 03:04:13.120]  i was trying to remember his name that was i'm even sure it's respect to him no uh his name's hog it's
[03:04:13.120 --> 03:04:21.520]  why it was just it was a pleasing slip of the tongue that's all piglet he's he's he's uh
[03:04:21.520 --> 03:04:27.200]  george soros is piglet like a little dropping come on you know pokemini squeals soros is like
[03:04:27.200 --> 03:04:33.840]  wobbling along pokemini squeals gun control gun control all right we're gonna come back in 60
[03:04:33.840 --> 03:04:39.360]  seconds with the head of gp the mighty gateway pundin who does have a lot of courage to point out
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:44.000]  the obvious that a bunch of scripted kids up there in the drama department and media department
[03:04:44.000 --> 03:04:47.200]  who are just scripted have been chosen to be the pr people we're not saying the shooting
[03:04:47.200 --> 03:04:51.200]  didn't happen we're not saying they're crisis actors we're saying these are the scripted people
[03:04:51.200 --> 03:04:59.280]  be forced down our throats here i'm so excited the new product at info warslife.com in a glass

[03:05:18.800 --> 03:05:23.360]  prescribing to their patients but it wasn't prescription but they were charging people
[03:05:23.360 --> 03:05:28.880]  a hundred two hundred dollars for the formulae and i came up with our own formulae working

[03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:28.960]  imperial majesty jim hoft of gateway pundit who uh we were we're great we're blessed blessed and
[03:06:28.960 --> 03:06:32.960]  grateful he can stay with us for another 10 minutes um let's see what he can get accomplished
[03:06:32.960 --> 03:06:36.320]  in that time i by the way could have found out that information you were mentioning in
[03:06:36.320 --> 03:06:43.680]  six point seven two minutes um no seriously though hey hey what about this jim no one i know
[03:06:44.240 --> 03:06:47.920]  people are getting mad at me that i'm not saying it's totally fake people go is this
[03:06:47.920 --> 03:06:53.840]  like an after school special i mean no one is buying it and then cnn blames the president
[03:06:53.840 --> 03:07:00.080]  or or he donald trump jr when these kids are in drama they're on tv their parents are anti gun
[03:07:00.080 --> 03:07:05.520]  they're the only ones being force fed everywhere we know a pr rollout when we're seeing it i don't
[03:07:05.520 --> 03:07:10.080]  know the whole truth of what happened i just know that we are being fed something as funny as the
[03:07:10.080 --> 03:07:17.120]  three dollar bill what do you say before alex we saw this with the 9 11 widows that they they
[03:07:17.120 --> 03:07:22.000]  propped up and uh and brought out and wanted to push policy with the widows and now we're
[03:07:22.000 --> 03:07:26.160]  seeing this with the children from uh this shooting and god bless them i'm i'm glad that
[03:07:26.160 --> 03:07:32.800]  they're okay i'm it's a horrible tragedy but they're obviously uh uh used by uh you know
[03:07:32.800 --> 03:07:37.120]  there's already we blink them to some soros groups who are behind these marches and these protests
[03:07:37.120 --> 03:07:43.200]  that are being planned and so we know it's a complete astroturf and uh the fact that we
[03:07:43.200 --> 03:07:48.320]  pointed out then it's it's a tactic of the left they come then they come at us completely like
[03:07:48.320 --> 03:07:53.360]  we hate children or something and uh we're just pointing out the obvious and you know thank god
[03:07:53.360 --> 03:07:58.400]  a lot of americans agree with us they see what's happening well yeah you can't use young adults
[03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:03.040]  because you know they call 25 as they say is the new 13 under a restaurant development you can't take
[03:08:03.040 --> 03:08:06.800]  high school seniors and shove them out in the political war saying turn all your guns in and
[03:08:06.800 --> 03:08:11.920]  like people start breaking their guns i agree oh you know some of us aren't gonna sit there like
[03:08:11.920 --> 03:08:16.560]  throw our guns out the window marches because you know they put these people on air going
[03:08:16.560 --> 03:08:21.920]  never one more death well what about all these llamas's deaths or all the rest of it uh where
[03:08:21.920 --> 03:08:27.600]  do you see this going i see free speech panel at cpaq cancelled by pamela galler at her gateway
[03:08:27.600 --> 03:08:34.480]  pundit jim hoff banned i mean it's like the hysteria firing congressman's assistance because
[03:08:34.480 --> 03:08:39.280]  they said these kids look as funny as the three dollar bill i mean they are so scared of us even
[03:08:39.280 --> 03:08:46.000]  questioning their narrative right it's it's it's it's unbelievable really and uh so i i get to join
[03:08:46.000 --> 03:08:54.080]  mylo's group and it's it's an exclusive group the cpaq exile club right and you know what i didn't
[03:08:54.080 --> 03:09:00.000]  even sit you know we we had an article about these kids that was the last straw but i i have to tell
[03:09:00.000 --> 03:09:06.800]  you guys that what i heard before this was that we had planned this panel and it's very important
[03:09:06.800 --> 03:09:12.720]  because you know mylo certainly knows um that conservatives are being targeted on social media
[03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:17.360]  we're being banned we're being shadow banned we're being blocked we're being kicked off like mylo
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:22.000]  and uh we all know this it's very important they're trying to shut us down they're trying to shut down
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:28.000]  the voices so we organized this panel pamela galler did a lot of work she actually i'm just gonna
[03:09:28.000 --> 03:09:35.120]  break some news here pamela planned this for six months she was begging cpaq to do this panel
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:40.080]  they finally gave her their approval on monday night after the agenda was already written up
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:45.600]  so that her name couldn't be on this agenda that's what i believe now i absolutely agree with that i
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:50.400]  absolutely agree with that i've seen them in operation myself um from you know the the funders
[03:09:50.400 --> 03:09:53.920]  by the way are always in the meeting room when you go in to talk to cpaq you know that they
[03:09:53.920 --> 03:09:57.360]  wanted a meeting with me they wanted me to be a headliner of the law and what it is is corporations
[03:09:57.360 --> 03:10:02.480]  wanting to control your speech to get entree into their bs this is just one more level of the
[03:10:02.480 --> 03:10:09.120]  censorship well cpaq people sometimes don't realize because it has the um the uh false reputation
[03:10:09.120 --> 03:10:14.240]  for being a sort of younger lively a cooler bit of the conservative movement actually it's run by
[03:10:14.240 --> 03:10:19.440]  you know crepekeepers up on top well it is run by crepekeepers it's run by the oldest of the oldest
[03:10:19.440 --> 03:10:26.000]  of the oldest school evangelical republican old god you know uh and they just regularly just dip
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:29.600]  in and nuke things that they don't like the look of you know this is establishment republicans
[03:10:29.600 --> 03:10:35.280]  behaving just as badly to jim to pamela and there are businesses these these these scared
[03:10:35.280 --> 03:10:42.240]  established republicans like let me see it inside something bad oh get rid of all that's the only
[03:10:42.240 --> 03:10:46.640]  thing holding this up we get rid of these people we'll take the country back now i mean look pamela
[03:10:46.640 --> 03:10:51.680]  galler is a is a hero for a garland texas for speaking of course he is i pub he's a free speech
[03:10:51.680 --> 03:10:56.000]  icon i published her last book we were the first publishers to put the cartoon the winning cartoon
[03:10:56.000 --> 03:11:01.600]  from garland which is so mild-mannered really you know in a book her you know all the rest of it i've
[03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:06.480]  been hearing her as you have jim to tell the truth in a world of universal deceit right exactly uh
[03:11:06.480 --> 03:11:09.920]  i've been hearing her tell me jim like she's been telling you like she's been trying to put this
[03:11:09.920 --> 03:11:16.960]  panel together because cpaq's been pretending she doesn't exist for three years we young the young
[03:11:16.960 --> 03:11:24.160]  boys come in we let them play but it's just small it's a fake news panel it's about free speech because
[03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:29.280]  and because gateway pundit exercised their first amendment rise to report something everybody knows
[03:11:29.280 --> 03:11:34.480]  is true they banned you like here's the actors they roll out these four hey let's bring in
[03:11:34.480 --> 03:11:39.440]  oh and shroyer her like hey you want jim hop like wow why try to get jim hopped on yellow skin him on
[03:11:39.440 --> 03:11:44.880]  so so what is your take on this one and another key points here well now you have as you mentioned
[03:11:44.880 --> 03:11:50.880]  earlier state representatives are firing their aides for calling the student activists actors
[03:11:50.880 --> 03:11:57.280]  even though it's a fact they're in the drama club we have them being posted in social media pictures
[03:11:57.280 --> 03:12:03.200]  from the drama club we have them on the set of cnn desks we have them celebrating oh look at me
[03:12:03.200 --> 03:12:07.680]  honestly it kind of feels like a very narcissistic thing uh seeing these people yeah what about all
[03:12:07.680 --> 03:12:12.560]  the smiling and giggling and laughing like our friends all got killed we're on tv
[03:12:14.400 --> 03:12:18.480]  and i'm not i mean it's like how dare you attack the victims no i'm like should they be acting more
[03:12:18.480 --> 03:12:23.280]  solemn well you know they say poachers make the best gamekeepers you know that expression yes well i
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:28.400]  can tell you um as a professional narcissist that that's exactly what's going on with these kids
[03:12:28.400 --> 03:12:33.520]  i can give you my expert insight into narcissism and tell you that there's you know that the particular
[03:12:33.520 --> 03:12:42.480]  kind of like weird uh funless rictus grin um you know smugness of it all is exactly what you would
[03:12:42.480 --> 03:12:47.360]  expect it is very sinister and i you know it it just everything sinks about it it just does well
[03:12:47.360 --> 03:12:50.800]  jim hop we want to get you back for a full hour soon to talk about everything that's happening at
[03:12:50.800 --> 03:12:56.080]  gateway pundit land uh but we'll have champagne and can't other people off it for you next time
[03:12:56.080 --> 03:13:01.680]  other little nibblets of because i'm not just saying this to declare victory no one is buying
[03:13:01.680 --> 03:13:06.480]  anything anymore that the establishment says i think there probably really was a shooting here
[03:13:06.480 --> 03:13:10.880]  and it's terrible but the aliens who land in central park and no one would believe it if the
[03:13:10.880 --> 03:13:14.960]  media said it uh your comment oh and you're gonna keep going that's the next segment
[03:13:16.880 --> 03:13:23.520]  oh yeah absolutely and uh it's uh it's uh it's a shame that c-pack decided to take marching orders
[03:13:23.520 --> 03:13:28.480]  from chelsea clinton who tweeted against us yesterday and then the next by that evening
[03:13:28.480 --> 03:13:33.360]  we're getting kicked off a c-pack so i believe chelsea clinton for all of this by the way can we
[03:13:33.360 --> 03:13:38.800]  come back with the billy goat clip this to the fbi calls her the billy goat even her own supporters
[03:13:39.360 --> 03:13:45.680]  you know republicans craving the approval of the left is at the heart of almost every problem
[03:13:45.680 --> 03:13:50.240]  this country has it is craving because it's it's i'm not being mean to old people a lot of folks
[03:13:50.240 --> 03:13:56.320]  at rate but the old people that believe mainstream media they still go it was on i saw i saw it on
[03:13:56.320 --> 03:14:03.440]  the fox i see it in you know baby are you are you in the media that's a nice vision into what
[03:14:03.440 --> 03:14:13.440]  you'll be like in 15 years i'm seriously where is this all going uh well i i'm glad it's getting
[03:14:13.440 --> 03:14:18.320]  a little press today i'm glad you know that i have people out there who support me still like
[03:14:18.320 --> 03:14:22.720]  pamela galler i mean it's amazing she they told her that they didn't want me on the panel and she
[03:14:22.720 --> 03:14:26.640]  said well then you're canceling the panel they said no we're not canceling the panel she said yeah
[03:14:26.640 --> 03:14:31.280]  you are because i'm not going to go on without jim hoff so i i have total respect for pamela
[03:14:31.280 --> 03:14:37.280]  galler and for people like pam who uh you know are sticking up for uh their their friends and
[03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:44.000]  cohorts and doing the right thing jim hoff said they were democrat operatives and were like look
[03:14:44.000 --> 03:14:51.520]  scripted i mean they're all you can't all see it it'll get mad at me saturday night jim i'm uh
[03:14:51.520 --> 03:14:56.560]  headlining event from mike sernovich with uh stefan molyneux so uh i'm sure if you get in
[03:14:56.560 --> 03:15:02.480]  touch with uh with mike uh perhaps we can restage the panel uh you know when there's un conferences
[03:15:02.480 --> 03:15:06.880]  if you can't get into the secret special inner circle of the un you have these things called
[03:15:06.880 --> 03:15:11.280]  readers side events or whatever like that unofficial that you should call it the c-pack
[03:15:11.280 --> 03:15:16.720]  reject the thing the c-pack rejects are too dangerous for c-pack too dangerous for c-pack
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:23.120]  too hot for c-pack yeah well anyway let's uh let's let's see if we can't get at least at least
[03:15:23.120 --> 03:15:27.040]  pamela and and a couple of people down for that and we'll uh see if we can still have the the
[03:15:27.040 --> 03:15:31.280]  panel hey look at a three thousand students it's only four people everywhere hey look they're all

[03:22:35.120 --> 03:22:39.760]  you survived the attack you're seeing what is it like for you to not be on the news no one will
[03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:44.480]  talk to your your friends repeat what you told me three hours ago before he went live you've got the
[03:22:44.480 --> 03:22:49.760]  floor i'm going to shut up uh jaylon martin uh you're driving to this uh cnn town hall event right
[03:22:49.760 --> 03:22:54.400]  now one of the survivors there at the marjorie stoman douglas high school in florida from this
[03:22:54.400 --> 03:23:02.240]  whole situation uh please give us your data download sir yeah um i'm not too too upset about
[03:23:02.240 --> 03:23:09.120]  the fact that i'm not on all the um lame shroom news uh media outlets but there's best not what
[03:23:09.120 --> 03:23:15.200]  i'm here for that i'm just here to give an opposing view from my view um and a lot of other people
[03:23:15.200 --> 03:23:21.200]  around me who's just not being covered i'm the only one who's putting myself out there to do this
[03:23:21.840 --> 03:23:26.880]  a lot of the other students who have the same voice aren't doing that so i'm just going to be the one
[03:23:26.880 --> 03:23:32.880]  who does it for that um whenever someone else comes out then i'll keep talking about it but
[03:23:32.880 --> 03:23:36.800]  i'm not going to go out there and speak out well you're telling me a lot of your friends agree but
[03:23:36.800 --> 03:23:41.520]  they're scared to go on air yeah a lot of them do they're scared to go on here i'm pretty sure
[03:23:41.520 --> 03:23:47.280]  because they see how the media landscape is where if you go on air and you have an opposing view
[03:23:47.280 --> 03:23:52.960]  especially something like this then you're going to be held it and they don't have that social kind
[03:23:52.960 --> 03:23:59.760]  of uh uh stability to do that let's just say they don't have the courage and moral compass i mean i'm
[03:23:59.760 --> 03:24:08.560]  not putting them down but you you've got will yeah i'm 100 ready to do this because i feel like
[03:24:09.200 --> 03:24:14.880]  i waited i waited a day just to try to see what was in public which one of these kids was gonna
[03:24:14.880 --> 03:24:19.360]  you know say something there was one kid um he said something to brand william of course brand
[03:24:19.360 --> 03:24:24.880]  william i don't know why he's still on air i mean he's my favorite news anchor but obviously
[03:24:26.160 --> 03:24:33.920]  it makes you question a lot of things but things about him come out um but that whole idea of
[03:24:33.920 --> 03:24:39.520]  immediately covering one side of things really just festers in your mind and then just taking
[03:24:39.520 --> 03:24:44.560]  more you have to say something you know it this is the thing about it they don't want to come to me
[03:24:44.560 --> 03:24:50.000]  because they they've been in the people's system in this um echo chamber of just one sided views
[03:24:50.000 --> 03:24:54.640]  for so long they don't have a big talking point for me so they can't really do any kind of lessons
[03:24:55.200 --> 03:25:02.080]  i'm gonna be one sided what is it like to see as you dub them the fantastic four who are there we
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:06.160]  know shooting happen it's terrible but they're shooting video in closets while it's happening
[03:25:06.160 --> 03:25:10.880]  they're hooked in with the democrats and then people question that and say it looks scripted
[03:25:10.880 --> 03:25:16.400]  did and then they get fired what do you make of that i think they have talking points for sure
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:20.720]  i don't think any of them are actors or anything like that i do think they have talking points
[03:25:20.720 --> 03:25:28.800]  yeah some of them are in drama um right i don't necessarily see that as i don't think that's um
[03:25:29.360 --> 03:25:32.960]  is a lot of questions oh i don't think that's a bad thing either exactly was it they've got
[03:25:32.960 --> 03:25:37.360]  democrat parents anti-gun parents and exactly we're not saying there's their crisis actors
[03:25:37.360 --> 03:25:42.800]  we're saying it looks scripted it does look scripted it looks like they get talking point
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:46.880]  uh but you saw that interview with david where he just couldn't get off that one
[03:25:48.320 --> 03:25:51.680]  you know since you mentioned that let's play that clip they gave me a bunch of clips
[03:25:51.680 --> 03:25:57.520]  can we play the one where he's bumbling is that the one where the david hog uh is is is is bumbling
[03:25:57.520 --> 03:26:03.200]  and isn't able to get it back together do we have that clip guys here it is because we had
[03:26:03.200 --> 03:26:07.520]  had a fire alarm earlier that day and that was a drill so we thought this was a drill too just
[03:26:07.520 --> 03:26:12.000]  another one because we have a lot of fire alarms uh a lot of fire drills at the school
[03:26:15.120 --> 03:26:17.680]  after we heard the first gunshot we initially thought it was a drill
[03:26:17.680 --> 03:26:25.200]  clearly that was a bad choice actually that was a bad choice because the janet sorry
[03:26:25.200 --> 03:26:31.520]  okay you're fine you're fine bless his little heart bless his little heart let me put you in on
[03:26:31.520 --> 03:26:36.800]  something by the way with this when you watch somebody and they have that pause um when you
[03:26:36.800 --> 03:26:40.640]  look at somebody who's speaking when you're not scripted you don't shut up like i do where you
[03:26:40.640 --> 03:26:46.640]  do you can't shut in it's clearly he's he's like sorry just like an acting sorry sorry yeah sorry
[03:26:46.640 --> 03:26:50.800]  like i was here with john aries and we on the writer shooting scenes and i like thought i'd do a great
[03:26:50.800 --> 03:26:56.240]  job once it was actually lines i'm like oh crap sorry ten takes exactly sorry sorry the director
[03:26:56.240 --> 03:27:00.560]  and you notice that there's that pause there's the freeze look of terror the realization of
[03:27:00.560 --> 03:27:05.200]  blankness and then that flick of the eyes to the left and back again director and and it's yes exactly
[03:27:05.200 --> 03:27:11.520]  it's trained to whoever is off camera and it's an involuntary thing that you do when you're starting
[03:27:11.520 --> 03:27:15.840]  out or when you don't know better and you haven't learned your steel discipline yet um and you're
[03:27:15.840 --> 03:27:23.600]  you're alive and you panic and you're like i'm sorry and it's just a naturally instinctive like
[03:27:23.600 --> 03:27:27.840]  when you're like oh sorry you say sorry to the director that's that's that's the thing
[03:27:27.840 --> 03:27:33.920]  yeah no it's like sorry is like a sorry i messed up my line no i've got to restart it means it means
[03:27:33.920 --> 03:27:40.000]  roll again sorry sorry means a fresh take yeah yeah exactly can i that's it sorry means fresh
[03:27:40.000 --> 03:27:46.000]  take can i can we cut and can we redo that take yes you watch it and go sorry i messed that up
[03:27:46.000 --> 03:27:53.040]  there yeah they re-roll you start over again exactly it's um it's just it's it's in the subtleties

[03:36:35.920 --> 03:36:40.480]  the uh the wireless microphone alex this is the one we're using today and i'm just going to leave
[03:36:40.480 --> 03:36:44.880]  it at that because we've got some serious if you if you bring it a little closer and just tilt the
[03:36:44.880 --> 03:36:50.720]  angle up slightly somebody uh somebody shut myla down please myla don't get that joke was i mean
[03:36:50.720 --> 03:36:57.360]  this is the alex joan show here hey seriously it's a family broadcast oh and sir how has this
[03:36:57.360 --> 03:37:02.400]  disintegrated with all these known democratic party operatives we're not saying a tax didn't
[03:37:02.400 --> 03:37:07.440]  happen we're not making jokes about it this is very serious no one's buying the official story
[03:37:07.440 --> 03:37:12.960]  what's happening well even at the start of this week and towards the end of last week when we
[03:37:12.960 --> 03:37:17.520]  were covering this and we were seeing some of these other angles cropping up like the students
[03:37:17.520 --> 03:37:24.080]  being in drama class and david hogs dad being in the fbi and all this other strangeness you
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:28.880]  you kind of reach this this foggy area where you're just like do i really want to touch that
[03:37:28.880 --> 03:37:33.280]  do i really want to talk about that do i really have to go there again it just looks completely
[03:37:33.280 --> 03:37:40.160]  phony and like a plastic plastic banana and so what they do is if we cover things you had to
[03:37:40.160 --> 03:37:45.120]  say banana if we cover if we cover things like sandy hook is it not when you say plastic what do
[03:37:45.120 --> 03:37:50.560]  you think it's about fake i wasn't somewhere whatever psychology fronty and stuff you got going on
[03:37:50.560 --> 03:37:56.560]  i think a plastic i think a plastic banana i i think that was only in owens head yeah yeah that's
[03:37:56.560 --> 03:38:00.960]  right myla wasn't giggling at all but there you guys go down that road again oh and i was just
[03:38:00.960 --> 03:38:04.800]  noticing something this is just this is just what happens when myla comes around plastic vomit
[03:38:06.560 --> 03:38:11.840]  a plastic uh plastic face like adam shiffer brine stelter i don't know but the point is when we
[03:38:11.840 --> 03:38:18.400]  cover hillary's like plastic hillary's plastic under a heat lamp you know all right oh let's get
[03:38:18.400 --> 03:38:25.120]  serious sorry when we cover these things that look like plastic they look fake like the vegas
[03:38:25.120 --> 03:38:31.040]  shooting and the sandy hook and they say questioning something plastic is evil but they don't even but
[03:38:31.040 --> 03:38:35.040]  they don't even they don't even cover what you cover so it's like here's anerson cooper's nose
[03:38:35.040 --> 03:38:39.440]  disappearing off a blue screen and you're like well what is that that's strange okay here's all
[03:38:39.440 --> 03:38:45.840]  these pictures of the fantastic four that goes on cnn uh british these four kids are being force fed
[03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:49.680]  everywhere elix i've got a clip i'm gonna play it on the war room we can we can have the you
[03:38:49.680 --> 03:38:54.720]  play it now cue it up all right there's a clip where the one girl um i forget her name emma

[03:39:00.880 --> 03:39:06.240]  we're gonna be back in school with our students oh yeah this is the one she's like unless unless
[03:39:06.240 --> 03:39:10.320]  we have to do interviews you know unless we have to start working and doing it i mean they're already
[03:39:10.320 --> 03:39:15.040]  admitting that they're basically cnn reporters now i mean they're they're basically admitting it
[03:39:15.040 --> 03:39:19.760]  here's the clip did what did you both think about the president tweeting over the weekend
[03:39:19.760 --> 03:39:24.960]  very sad isn't the clip i missed all the signs signals sent out but it's a nice clip that's a
[03:39:24.960 --> 03:39:29.120]  nice clip it's a good clip it's the same interview but it's at the end of this interview that that's
[03:39:29.120 --> 03:39:34.800]  from the beginning of the interview how about i just give you a moment to break you go check
[03:39:34.800 --> 03:39:41.200]  you go check with why don't why don't no we're gonna go you i think i think owens uh wild
[03:39:41.200 --> 03:39:46.320]  intemperate lust which flares every time i'm in studio don't has resulted in this terrible
[03:39:46.320 --> 03:39:50.400]  mistake in a blowout this oh look let's see look look at this lady we're back now we're back with
[03:39:50.400 --> 03:40:06.960]  the proper purple power seriously yeah seriously let's get serious do you have the clip ready
[03:40:06.960 --> 03:40:12.080]  i don't think they have the clip ready now all right i'm gonna let you take a pause oh and

[03:40:29.360 --> 03:40:37.040]  i'm like charges to dinko and up and smoke at the very last scene it's like anyways get
[03:40:37.040 --> 03:40:41.280]  listen let's get serious though there we make jokes all day and i like the fact you're joking
[03:40:41.280 --> 03:40:45.360]  around i'll pick up on that it's a good brain brainwave but they're coming after our second
[03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:49.920]  amendment they know what they're doing this is clearly organized they clearly have like little
[03:40:50.960 --> 03:40:59.200]  operations going on how do we counter them well the most important thing that i think
[03:40:59.200 --> 03:41:04.880]  that the pro second and pro first amendment activists and ordinary americans have at their
[03:41:04.880 --> 03:41:07.760]  disposal the most important thing they have in their arsenal is that they really care they're
[03:41:07.760 --> 03:41:12.880]  really sincere the left seems to think that it can bully bully people on first and second amendment
[03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:18.480]  i don't think the left realizes how seriously americans take their freedom how seriously americans
[03:41:18.480 --> 03:41:22.720]  take their right to express themselves and their right to protect themselves you know and to bear
[03:41:22.720 --> 03:41:27.440]  arms i've never seen people so upset by the bullying going on right but i mean you know
[03:41:27.440 --> 03:41:32.160]  they can they can make these language adjustments with the political correctness stuff they can
[03:41:32.160 --> 03:41:37.280]  put gay people on tv and who cares whatever like it americans will kind of let things go
[03:41:37.280 --> 03:41:39.840]  which is one of the problems you know you sort of ratchet left towards the constant because
[03:41:39.840 --> 03:41:43.520]  people just i'll let it go it's not what if i not what if i but if you come for free expression
[03:41:43.520 --> 03:41:48.640]  or you come for guns you're gonna lose and increase exactly first or second amendment
[03:41:48.640 --> 03:41:55.840]  it's on bitch exactly it's quite uh and and i you know i think perhaps the the misuse let's
[03:41:55.840 --> 03:42:01.840]  let's call it misuse of child testimony in this particular example they're exploiting these poor
[03:42:01.840 --> 03:42:06.160]  young young young people well he's a really bad they're like i want to be in a movie or tv show
[03:42:06.160 --> 03:42:10.640]  they're like no you're in bloomberg michael bloomberg's anti-gun extravaganza but that's not the worst
[03:42:10.640 --> 03:42:14.240]  bit of the exploitation i mean you know that it's a sign of desperation that they're using kids in
[03:42:14.240 --> 03:42:19.280]  the first place anyway but the real uh you know the real horror being inflicted on these kids is
[03:42:19.280 --> 03:42:23.440]  not just that they're pawns for political points of view the horror being inflicted on these kids
[03:42:23.440 --> 03:42:27.840]  is they're advocating against their own interests because guns in the arms of teachers would make
[03:42:27.840 --> 03:42:32.560]  those children safer they're not only having children go on tv and preach politics they're
[03:42:32.560 --> 03:42:37.520]  having children go on tv and teach and preach politics that would make them less safe did i
[03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:45.280]  just hear a Winston Churchill speech with growing confidence and strength in the air and even there
