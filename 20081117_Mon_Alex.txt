[01:38.160 --> 01:43.480]  predictor for the individual who has a really good track record of predicting
[01:43.480 --> 01:46.760]  what is coming up and what's happening remember last week we wrote a story at
[01:46.760 --> 01:53.240]  prisonplanet.com now or saloon tape gone on Fox News saying total depression by
[01:53.240 --> 02:00.000]  2012 absolute breakdown of society that the others been a coup by wall street to
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.840]  take over the United States I mean anybody who just reads industry
[02:06.840 --> 02:13.880]  publications and financial publications knows that but so much of the public
[02:13.880 --> 02:19.760]  still don't realize how deep or how hot the water is that we're all in saloon
[02:19.760 --> 02:24.720]  tape predicts revolution food riots tax rebellions by 2012 trend that
[02:24.720 --> 02:30.080]  forecaster renowned for being accurate in the past says the America will cease
[02:30.080 --> 02:33.840]  to be a developed nation within four years crisis will be worse than great
[02:33.840 --> 02:38.640]  depression out large swaths of the country are already third world it is the
[02:38.640 --> 02:45.400]  official UN IMF World Bank International Bank of Settlements policy to turn us
[02:45.400 --> 02:51.160]  into a third-world country and that's stated the bankers want to bankrupt you
[02:51.160 --> 02:58.880]  they want your assets they want you poor they want you uneducated with your
[02:58.880 --> 03:04.160]  government-provided television set drooling and if you don't watch a lot of
[03:04.160 --> 03:08.240]  TV for years I just quit watching television almost entirely I would see
[03:08.240 --> 03:12.920]  in a restaurant or at somebody's house and marvel at it but trying to get back
[03:12.920 --> 03:17.680]  in shape on the treadmill it's just too boring without watching TV and so I
[03:17.680 --> 03:23.760]  watch the news and I mean it is cartoonish it's all lies all spin all
[03:23.760 --> 03:28.760]  disinformation it's unspeakable I can't believe that probably half the public
[03:28.760 --> 03:32.040]  watches it and believes it's real
[03:34.040 --> 03:41.320]  by the way Congress has put out another report so some some watchdog groups every
[03:41.320 --> 03:45.200]  news station they looked at they looked at 75 across the country that's all they
[03:45.200 --> 03:49.880]  had money to look at every news station they looked at that's what they looked
[03:49.880 --> 03:58.720]  at had fake news not now I fake news these are video packages that the local
[03:58.720 --> 04:02.520]  news reader reads over to make it look like it's local telling you it's the
[04:02.520 --> 04:06.480]  law to take shots I already talked about this yesterday just blows me away we
[04:06.480 --> 04:13.000]  have such a criminal media such a criminal illegal bankrupt government that
[04:13.000 --> 04:20.680]  for decades a large portion of the news I mean it's already propaganda is
[04:20.680 --> 04:25.680]  completely fake and lies that's why I said yesterday I was going to be
[04:25.680 --> 04:29.680]  interviewed by a National Geographic but you know what I think I'm gonna call
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.640]  them today and I'm just not gonna do it because I'm not gonna why why go into a
[04:35.640 --> 04:41.160]  stack deck why why why let them try to set us up
[04:41.160 --> 04:45.080]  talk about that some to today but look the news is coming up it's all very
[04:45.080 --> 04:50.640]  important we're gonna go through just some of the latest lawlessness of the
[04:50.640 --> 04:57.520]  crime gang the armed crime gang known as government stay with me
[05:00.000 --> 05:04.480]  hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important
[05:04.480 --> 05:07.760]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be
[05:07.760 --> 05:11.320]  independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a
[05:11.320 --> 05:14.560]  bread line if you have your own bread you'll never have to go to the super
[05:14.560 --> 05:18.440]  dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[05:18.440 --> 05:21.960]  simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout
[05:21.960 --> 05:25.760]  for special interest so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off
[05:25.760 --> 05:30.240]  the telephones and email they voted to print 850 billion dollars at least out
[05:30.240 --> 05:33.920]  of thin air this money now owns the American and European banks the
[05:33.920 --> 05:37.720]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[05:37.720 --> 05:41.440]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond
[05:41.440 --> 05:46.000]  many Americans reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of
[05:46.000 --> 05:50.240]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks food
[05:50.240 --> 05:54.000]  prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.720]  sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan
[05:57.720 --> 06:01.320]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food
[06:01.320 --> 06:05.480]  but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to
[06:05.480 --> 06:09.000]  be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[06:09.000 --> 06:12.800]  Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my
[06:12.800 --> 06:16.960]  friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for
[06:16.960 --> 06:19.920]  everybody out there listening it's very important for you understand that by
[06:19.920 --> 06:23.120]  having a supply of storeable food the government the new old order has a lot
[06:23.120 --> 06:26.720]  less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency
[06:26.720 --> 06:30.400]  and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final
[06:30.400 --> 06:33.840]  equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship
[06:33.840 --> 06:37.600]  storeable food that's safe from E. coli salmonella genetic alteration or
[06:37.600 --> 06:41.240]  Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery

[07:06.760 --> 07:13.920]  storeable food ease the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio
[07:13.920 --> 07:21.160]  network all right Fred Forecaster futurist Harold Salente joining us in T-
[07:21.160 --> 07:35.360]  minus 52 minutes 45 seconds we're also going to have Max Kaiser on on the
[07:35.360 --> 07:42.800]  economy in the fourth hour today and wide open phones as well at 1-800-259-9231
[07:42.800 --> 07:52.320]  I have to admit I knew that Oprah Winfrey set up a church back in 2005 I
[07:52.320 --> 07:57.440]  knew it was New Age global government merged the religion type stuff the same
[07:57.440 --> 08:01.840]  thing the last two popes have been pushing but I you know I don't watch
[08:01.840 --> 08:07.200]  Oprah Winfrey I don't watch hardly any TV and you know she seems like a nice
[08:07.200 --> 08:11.280]  smiley-faced person and so I didn't really have any antagonism towards her
[08:11.280 --> 08:17.640]  and as a modern guilty white taught that I'm evil and pathetic I kind of a
[08:17.640 --> 08:22.240]  blind spot for black folks because you know black folks are from the grassroots
[08:22.240 --> 08:28.400]  to the salt of the earth but they can't be big powerful new world order deceivers
[08:28.400 --> 08:35.120]  well I did some research on her this weekend and again ladies and gentlemen
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.440]  all the time send me emails clippings they say why aren't you covering this
[08:39.440 --> 08:42.840]  why aren't you covering that why are you covering this up why are you covering
[08:42.840 --> 08:50.520]  that up folks I'm just an average person here you know I gotta try to make
[08:50.520 --> 08:54.640]  breakfast for my children I gotta I mean I I mean that frankly I spend
[08:54.640 --> 08:58.480]  probably too much time six seven eight hours a day sometimes researching I'm
[08:58.480 --> 09:03.440]  totally addicted to it like some cogiter I could set up in a tower and just
[09:03.440 --> 09:08.720]  read manuscripts 14 hours a day and stare out over the wasted planes of
[09:08.720 --> 09:15.520]  Agmar but the point is that I can't and I'm not aware of everything so thank you
[09:15.520 --> 09:21.880]  for asking me I was an email I got to look into it and sending me a few links
[09:21.880 --> 09:30.240]  because it's just total new world order total and very dangerous very dangerous
[09:30.240 --> 09:34.600]  and I don't even approach it from a Christian perspective I approach
[09:34.600 --> 09:41.080]  everything from just analyzing what the new world order attack plan is what
[09:41.080 --> 09:47.440]  their program of control is and they understand religion man's religion is a
[09:47.440 --> 09:51.680]  great way to control people and so the United Nations and the Club of
[09:51.680 --> 09:56.800]  Rome and CFR back in the 50s and 60s all right and we've read these reports and
[09:56.800 --> 10:04.800]  linked to them at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com that they were gonna
[10:04.800 --> 10:10.160]  create a false earth worship religion centered around restricting the
[10:10.160 --> 10:18.720]  resources of man so that the public will laud not fight against living in third
[10:18.720 --> 10:23.200]  world enslavement and so the third world can be suppressed from ever
[10:23.200 --> 10:29.240]  industrializing and threatening the Anglo-American command bases in London
[10:29.240 --> 10:37.760]  and New York and it's all stated in the International Royal Commission on
[10:37.760 --> 10:47.440]  population and countless other documents and they've got their Barack Obama's
[10:47.440 --> 10:52.800]  they've got their Hillary Clinton's they've got their Bill and Melinda
[10:52.800 --> 10:57.240]  Gates Foundation's they have their Oprah Winfrey's and just like Margaret
[10:57.240 --> 11:04.320]  Singer wrote back in the 20s and we've sent off to the universities and gotten
[11:04.320 --> 11:08.480]  copies of the letters it's true those quotes are real about blacks being
[11:08.480 --> 11:16.080]  weeds that need to be exterminated she's writing off to the big air of Colgate
[11:16.080 --> 11:20.840]  saying I need millions more we're recruiting prominent blacks because they
[11:20.840 --> 11:26.240]  can act as Judas goats to lead their fellow blacks into the eugenics
[11:26.240 --> 11:42.160]  operation it's just so shameful now in the case of Oprah Winfrey I liked her
[11:42.160 --> 11:46.040]  because I remember her 12 years ago or whatever exposing that Mad Cal was
[11:46.040 --> 11:50.320]  in the US but then she got a lot of trouble for that and kind of pulled her
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.440]  horns in and she may not be consciously evil but the lady's too smart to not
[11:54.440 --> 12:00.680]  know what she's part of really or she's a grand dupe but she is pushing the
[12:00.680 --> 12:09.080]  world government religion they had a big consortium of tech company owners come
[12:09.080 --> 12:12.800]  out this weekend and announce a international mission for a one-world
[12:12.800 --> 12:17.720]  religion in the name of harmony oh yeah you can have any religion you want just
[12:17.720 --> 12:21.400]  don't criticize any other and then you see that's an attack on free speech and
[12:21.400 --> 12:28.080]  then tyranny so there's a major move on to do this and later I'm gonna play some
[12:28.080 --> 12:37.240]  clips of that and go over it and it's always the same I mean you go take
[12:37.240 --> 12:43.200]  classes in political science and study Marxism Leninism socialism Fabian
[12:43.200 --> 12:49.160]  socialism and it's always the same utopic visions they always have a high-tech
[12:49.160 --> 12:57.320]  background they're promising no work heavenly future and when I really start
[12:57.320 --> 13:03.200]  recognizing how much of this stuff is infiltrating even the alternative
[13:03.200 --> 13:09.120]  media with films and radio shows and the rest of it you will always know them
[13:09.120 --> 13:14.040]  though because they're always anti-christian and they'll always attack true
[13:14.040 --> 13:25.120]  Christians via guilt by association or straw man by pointing out all the main
[13:25.120 --> 13:29.440]  line establishment phoning Christians who were put up there to dress like
[13:29.440 --> 13:34.600]  clowns and act like clowns to discredit true Christianity because just from a
[13:34.600 --> 13:43.720]  secular position from a sociological position studying this it is generally
[13:43.720 --> 13:49.000]  true Christians who resist tyranny who resists slavery who resists corruption
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.880]  who don't go along and it is really only Christians and I have to admit to a
[13:55.880 --> 14:02.040]  certain extent Muslims who are not fit for the New World Order and that's why
[14:02.040 --> 14:07.520]  Albert Pike said Christians and Muslims would be played off against each other
[14:07.520 --> 14:14.520]  he also threw in Judaism but that's been so taken over and so changed that it's
[14:14.520 --> 14:22.520]  not a major threat to the New World Order and I just see it everywhere it's so
[14:22.520 --> 14:25.880]  fashionable to make fun of Christians who attack Christians hey it's Christians
[14:25.880 --> 14:28.800]  that started the homeschooling movement in this country that's saving some of our
[14:28.800 --> 14:36.400]  future brain trust everybody else is basically irrevocably ruined it's the
[14:36.400 --> 14:41.440]  Christians that were the core group exposing the New World Order 20 30 40
[14:41.440 --> 14:48.160]  50 60 70 80 100 years ago it was the true Christians not the pulpit prostitutes
[14:48.160 --> 14:54.600]  paid off the intellectual prostitutes the ones paid off by FEMA I'm already
[14:54.600 --> 15:00.800]  digressing the point is that the enemy of the New World Order is true Christians
[15:00.800 --> 15:09.880]  and I just have to call it like it is also they don't like Muslims and that's
[15:09.880 --> 15:15.880]  why the New World Order loves playing the Christian world off against the Muslim
[15:15.880 --> 15:21.160]  world that's what the New World Order brings in masses of Muslims to
[15:21.160 --> 15:29.960]  antagonize the now secular debilitated disintegrating Christendom that's why
[15:29.960 --> 15:37.720]  they bring in Christian armies in name into Arabia and Central Asia to
[15:37.720 --> 15:42.080]  antagonize them to have a clash of civilizations as the neocons say they
[15:42.080 --> 15:46.800]  are they set us up against each other and in the Illuminous the old-time
[15:46.800 --> 15:57.640]  religion the Babylon Mystery Schools they reign supreme divide and conquer and
[15:57.640 --> 16:02.280]  so in our name in America's name three million Iraqis are dead in the last 18
[16:02.280 --> 16:08.080]  years half of those in the last five and a half in our name that was done and in
[16:08.080 --> 16:12.360]  the name of the Arabs in the name of the Muslims 9-11 was carried out but the
[16:12.360 --> 16:19.680]  same people that carried out the policies that brought you Iraq and the
[16:19.680 --> 16:23.560]  same people that orchestrated the hoax that is 9-11 they are one on the same
[16:23.560 --> 16:35.680]  they initiated this grand struggle where systems of thought not within New
[16:35.680 --> 16:39.200]  World Order control or diamond and certainly they've controlled those
[16:39.200 --> 16:42.960]  religions in the past a great extent and used them but but now there's no room
[16:42.960 --> 16:47.560]  for those it's now time for those to go bye-bye and if you don't accept the one
[16:47.560 --> 16:53.720]  world guy or religion whose central rule is humans are bad and guy needs blood
[16:53.720 --> 16:59.400]  by the way that's in the 96 biological diversity assessment that's in the 97
[16:59.400 --> 17:05.320]  biological diversity assessment passes policy and law by the UN it says we need
[17:05.320 --> 17:12.520]  to reenact human sacrifice through war and ritual killing do not roll your eyes
[17:12.520 --> 17:19.720]  go read it it's in my film road to tyranny blow-ups of the actual UN
[17:19.720 --> 17:23.760]  documents you can take the header off of them go to the UN's own website and read
[17:23.760 --> 17:28.360]  it for yourself instead of living in denial yeah I know that sounds crazy
[17:28.360 --> 17:33.800]  but I'm not the one that made it law internationally that their policy is to
[17:33.800 --> 17:41.040]  bring back mass murder that is a sacrifice ladies and gentlemen the
[17:41.040 --> 17:47.760]  3 million Iraqis were sacrificed to their god Lucifer now I'm gonna explain to
[17:47.760 --> 17:51.840]  you something if I talk about the Zoroastres and Iran today or I talk
[17:51.840 --> 17:57.840]  about animus in Central Africa it doesn't mean I believe in the Zoroastres are
[17:57.840 --> 18:02.840]  the animus or if I go study someone new at religion it doesn't mean I believe in
[18:02.840 --> 18:07.120]  what the Eskimos believe so you atheists can't ignore this and just throw it out
[18:07.120 --> 18:12.400]  I'm scientifically pointing out to you that the UN says they're setting up a
[18:12.400 --> 18:18.960]  one-world religion of anti-humanism see everything with them is a twist within a
[18:18.960 --> 18:22.560]  twist they claim they're humanist they're about expanding and empowering
[18:22.560 --> 18:28.520]  humanity it's the opposite they are anti-human genetically poisoning us
[18:28.520 --> 18:34.200]  altering our DNA this mercury alters the DNA generationally attacking us with
[18:34.200 --> 18:39.320]  sodium fluoride spraying our food with poisons all by design to dumb you down
[18:39.320 --> 18:43.800]  play God greedily

[23:58.440 --> 24:04.160]  every man woman and child old young black white
[24:05.160 --> 24:12.960]  five weeks ago we told you here on this radio show in finest detail told you six
[24:12.960 --> 24:16.920]  weeks ago seven weeks ago a year ago but in tune back into those archives at
[24:16.920 --> 24:23.280]  info wars dot com and hear us lay out exactly what happened and a lot of you
[24:23.280 --> 24:26.080]  out there but on the fence about this show and our information should ask
[24:26.080 --> 24:29.960]  yourselves well if this guy is just making stuff up how come he can predict
[24:29.960 --> 24:35.920]  everything folks I'm not predicting anything your enemy my enemy the new
[24:35.920 --> 24:40.640]  world order crime syndicate they are openly stating what they're going to do
[24:40.640 --> 24:45.880]  and it's not pretty now the big issue here is I want you to really think about
[24:45.880 --> 24:53.960]  this I want this to sink in I'm asking you to think about this and then go to
[24:53.960 --> 24:59.000]  the prison planet dot com forum and post in there your answer or to call into
[24:59.000 --> 25:06.000]  the radio show and tell me specifically the bankers again not your main street
[25:06.000 --> 25:12.120]  bank not your local bank the four big US banks that are tied into the other six
[25:12.120 --> 25:19.520]  international banks there's there's no more than ten big ins I've got some
[25:19.520 --> 25:27.960]  some city areas why are they publicly stealing five trillion in just five
[25:27.960 --> 25:36.920]  weeks that's about a trillion a week they knew it would come out why did
[25:36.920 --> 25:41.520]  Kashkari just smile and glare and and say he respected them but look at them
[25:41.520 --> 25:53.720]  with contempt and his body language was I'm a frat punk I'm rubbing it in you see
[25:53.720 --> 25:58.400]  it's a big joke to them why I mean it's now out in mainstream news they're
[25:58.400 --> 26:01.720]  stealing the money and they're keeping it and that and that they don't care as
[26:01.720 --> 26:04.760]  they lied and then it was never for subprime mortgages because subprime
[26:04.760 --> 26:10.360]  mortgages weren't the problem folks they just needed a psychological trigger for
[26:10.360 --> 26:15.080]  the history books to say oh it was the the subprime mortgages greedy dumb
[26:15.080 --> 26:18.640]  Americans went and got mortgages they couldn't afford of course the media and
[26:18.640 --> 26:22.080]  the government told them do it and the president Clinton and Bush came out and
[26:22.080 --> 26:26.200]  said you need to get these this is your dream these are offered this is the
[26:26.200 --> 26:34.040]  American thing to do all the poor folks were even hesitant to do it they were
[26:34.040 --> 26:39.480]  told do it they were told hey you've been blue collar your whole life but
[26:39.480 --> 26:44.800]  homeownerships the American dream don't be don't be shy don't keep a written and
[26:44.800 --> 26:50.960]  getting ripped off go in there and buy it see they psychologically need to say it
[26:50.960 --> 26:55.520]  was our fault it had nothing to do with it nothing to even do with it so of
[26:55.520 --> 27:00.800]  course they're not spending the money on that that money's to buy up the stock
[27:00.800 --> 27:07.640]  market and buy up other banks and they now admit that they're leveraging that
[27:07.640 --> 27:13.280]  money in the market into derivatives again you know you can do with five
[27:13.280 --> 27:19.000]  trillion that's what the congressman that you said he said what would it take
[27:19.000 --> 27:25.400]  to corner to leverage with the multiple they were all using code words up there
[27:25.400 --> 27:30.960]  but we know what that means that the fractional reserve multiple what would
[27:30.960 --> 27:38.400]  take the corner the 55 trillion asset of US banking which is really multinational
[27:38.400 --> 27:46.440]  global it's not geopolitical it's not centered around the US it's worldwide and
[27:46.440 --> 27:55.680]  he said five trillion see five trillion that five trillion and see issa was
[27:55.680 --> 28:00.280]  saying to him hey I'm not bringing this out I'm talking in code to you you better
[28:00.280 --> 28:05.360]  back off pal we know what you did that was the one time kashkari squirmed a
[28:05.360 --> 28:11.480]  bit I know you're an intelligent audience I'm not speaking above you out
[28:11.480 --> 28:15.400]  there some of you are new listeners he sounds like we're speaking Martian here
[28:15.400 --> 28:20.440]  I understand this is the real world we're discussing not football not acting
[28:20.440 --> 28:25.920]  cool not dressing studly or getting collagen injections in your lips the
[28:25.920 --> 28:36.320]  real world why did they do this knowing that everybody's gonna find out well
[28:36.320 --> 28:40.400]  it's a big answer it's got a lot of answers but all in the same direction
[28:40.400 --> 28:44.200]  they just don't care and that brings you to the next question why don't they
[28:44.200 --> 28:50.720]  care why are they stealing us blind right in front of us because they don't
[28:50.720 --> 28:59.280]  respect us and they shouldn't respect us we're a nation of wicked we're on the

[32:55.680 --> 33:01.280]  met this weekend and agreed to openly start regulating nations at the
[33:01.280 --> 33:06.240]  international level that private banks will be paid carbon taxes basically
[33:06.240 --> 33:09.120]  everything we've already written in white papers and been pushing for for
[33:09.120 --> 33:17.360]  decades and the private banks will continue to implode the real economy so
[33:17.360 --> 33:29.520]  they can suck it up they are continuing to consolidate the economy what is a
[33:29.520 --> 33:36.720]  mosquito do it injects the saliva into its prey to liquefy the cells and
[33:36.720 --> 33:42.680]  blood that was the injection of fiat currency and liquidity into the market
[33:42.680 --> 33:51.920]  that melts it down then it sucks it right back up these are predators it's
[33:51.920 --> 33:55.920]  why they're in control it's why they own the planet because they're ruthless and
[33:55.920 --> 34:01.080]  they don't care it is a guild of sociopaths and psychopaths who see us as
[34:01.080 --> 34:07.040]  weak those of us that care about our fellow humans those of us that have the
[34:07.040 --> 34:14.240]  proper programming who are in our natural state who understand what affects
[34:14.240 --> 34:21.160]  others ends up affecting us but it's an ingrained instinct
[34:21.160 --> 34:30.280]  and I know I talk about this a lot but it really hit me this weekend really hit
[34:30.280 --> 34:41.440]  me last night this morning it hit me hard three million dead Iraqis 18 years of
[34:41.440 --> 34:48.320]  siege all based on premeditated lies and madam Albright can get up on TV and
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.240]  say yeah I mean I'm glad they're dead it was a good thing to do good price to pay
[34:53.240 --> 35:00.000]  700,000 of them children at that time it was a million and a half dead half of
[35:00.000 --> 35:08.720]  them children see they don't care they're proud of it now I want to explain
[35:08.720 --> 35:13.160]  some to all of you that work for the system or have been in denial you

[35:22.000 --> 35:27.640]  care about Africans they don't care about anybody you understand that they
[35:27.640 --> 35:33.640]  don't care about you and they now know that they've got you in the grip of
[35:33.640 --> 35:36.720]  their propaganda that you're confused you don't know what's going on and they're
[35:36.720 --> 35:43.360]  making their move on you they're openly stealing five trillion dollars that's

[35:52.320 --> 35:56.720]  you understand ladies and gentlemen they're doing it in front of you and
[35:56.720 --> 36:01.800]  they're leveraging the money to wage war against the stock market and wage war
[36:01.800 --> 36:06.560]  against Main Street and the real economy to consolidate it that's what they do
[36:06.560 --> 36:11.640]  they're corporate raiders the New World Order is an offshore consortium an
[36:11.640 --> 36:19.880]  alliance of private corporations that combine forces in combines to wage war
[36:19.880 --> 36:27.280]  against sovereign nations and take them over in corporate takeovers they then
[36:27.280 --> 36:34.680]  implode the economies so they can vertically integrate the society a nice
[36:34.680 --> 36:40.440]  word for putting you out on your hind end and then with the other hand they
[36:40.440 --> 36:43.640]  then offer government jobs and government control which further
[36:43.640 --> 36:50.080]  domesticates us I was watching PBS yesterday they had a show called fuel I
[36:50.080 --> 36:54.120]  talked about this on last night show and they had a panel of about more than 10
[36:54.120 --> 36:59.520]  people one of them was Robert Kennedy Jr. and he said on there exactly what
[36:59.520 --> 37:03.400]  Obama's been saying and some of the other hosts some of the other commentators
[37:03.400 --> 37:11.680]  were saying that if you lose your job the government needs to hire you for an
[37:11.680 --> 37:18.520]  environmentalist job an environmental enforcer job it's on the Obama website

[38:52.120 --> 38:56.920]  unrest and help with car wrecks see that's a PR function oh why is the army
[38:56.920 --> 39:00.840]  here oh they're here to help with car wrecks just normal to have regular
[39:00.840 --> 39:03.840]  battle troops out helping they kill people and break things they fight
[39:03.840 --> 39:08.040]  enemies they're now deployed amongst us they were just suppressing the Iraqis
[39:08.040 --> 39:14.480]  but now they're here and they said they'll be out with the jaws of life
[39:14.480 --> 39:18.420]  helping people at car wrecks and army helicopters will now be your star
[39:18.420 --> 39:22.320]  flight see that's for PR it's the same thing in this article just like they
[39:22.320 --> 39:27.800]  occupy Iraq and spend billions a year in fake news and lies lying to them the
[39:27.800 --> 39:34.600]  military is not our military now and it's here lying to us when they first
[39:34.600 --> 39:39.280]  started getting rid of posse commentatus secretly in the late 80s they
[39:39.280 --> 39:42.520]  would have Marines and army dress up police uniforms and raid people's
[39:42.520 --> 39:46.440]  houses and gun shops that's all on record now let's see now they're out in the
[39:46.440 --> 39:51.880]  open so interesting thing about this is the foreign troops and it's on record
[39:51.880 --> 39:56.200]  and the deal signed six years ago between Canada Mexico and Europe to use
[39:56.200 --> 40:04.640]  foreign troops for quote civil emergencies riots and of course disasters
[40:04.640 --> 40:09.880]  whether man made or not so see that's not rumor and then in January of this
[40:09.880 --> 40:13.480]  year they signed a public deal in Congress said hey we weren't included in
[40:13.480 --> 40:22.280]  that North Dom said sit down and shut up you're not involved PDD 51 saying they'll
[40:22.280 --> 40:26.840]  use Mexican and Canadian troops here in the US so so it's on record foreign
[40:26.840 --> 40:30.680]  troops for America and then we can give you the quotes of general McCaffrey and
[40:30.680 --> 40:38.800]  general well many others let me see general McCaffrey's on record Barry
[40:38.800 --> 40:44.240]  McCaffrey and then the others are also on record at West Point saying they're
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.480]  gonna use foreign troops in America remember the Mexican troops came into
[40:48.480 --> 40:54.640]  Texas Louisiana said oh we're bringing you soup the Mexican flag down driving
[40:54.640 --> 41:03.880]  in the announcements they're all conditioning you troops dawned in combat
[41:03.880 --> 41:07.480]  troops down in combat few sites are sweeter than the approach of military
[41:07.480 --> 41:10.880]  rescuers see how they pose it they're coming to help get you out of your car
[41:10.880 --> 41:15.480]  wreck in a few weeks to some will be the center of efforts to speed up that
[41:15.480 --> 41:20.680]  lifesaving process personnel from around the globe will converge yet Davis
[41:20.680 --> 41:24.520]  Mountain Air Force base from December 1st December 12th for the largest rescue
[41:24.520 --> 41:30.120]  exercise of its kind the effort dubbed angel thunder will involve US Army and
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.080]  Air Force troops from Germany Chile Columbia so they're using troops from
[41:35.080 --> 41:40.640]  Central and South America in Iraq it's the death squads from Chile Columbia and
[41:40.640 --> 41:47.120]  observers from Canada Mexico Brazil and Pakistan several non-military US
[41:47.120 --> 41:50.600]  agencies the state and justice departments the National Geospatial
[41:50.600 --> 41:54.720]  Intelligence Agency that's the satellite spying on us and the National
[41:54.720 --> 41:58.240]  Reconnaissance Office same thing also will take part in the drills which aimed
[41:58.240 --> 42:01.840]  to smooth interaction between military branches allied nations and its
[42:01.840 --> 42:06.400]  civilian agencies that's right local police are going to be involved that's
[42:06.400 --> 42:10.000]  why it's for here in the US of course it has dual uses overseas but then they go
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.200]  on and say oh it's only for overseas but the state police will be involved
[42:19.440 --> 42:30.560]  this is so sick this is unbelievable so just more brainwashing more
[42:30.560 --> 42:33.760]  conditioning so the next time you hear about foreign troops yeah the Mexicans
[42:33.760 --> 42:38.360]  bring soup yeah that we got Norwegian AWACS and F-16s over us yeah there's all
[42:38.360 --> 42:42.160]  these German bases yeah there's all these Czech Republic bases yeah they were
[42:42.160 --> 42:46.520]  doing Mexican police drills with our military at Fort Hood oh yeah four
[42:46.520 --> 42:50.080]  bending Georgia yeah they're they're all over yeah the army's out running
[42:50.080 --> 42:54.480]  checkpoints now they're just helping the state police yeah yeah yeah it's all
[42:54.480 --> 43:02.000]  conditioning by the way speaking of government deception and government
[43:02.000 --> 43:10.120]  bankruptcy last week the Dallas Morning News the AP and others reported tens of
[43:10.120 --> 43:15.240]  thousands in the Dallas Fort Worth area now the way they minimize that is the
[43:15.240 --> 43:19.000]  new articles this week are saying you know they'll you they'll talk about per
[43:19.000 --> 43:23.000]  school and say well and then you know in this school there was a hundred and
[43:23.000 --> 43:28.840]  forty something people but total it's in the thousands in the state of Texas but
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.400]  they'll focus on this school district you know 149 in this school district up
[43:32.400 --> 43:35.920]  200 in this school they're gonna make it sound small but at the same time it
[43:35.920 --> 43:41.080]  sounds like they're reporting on it but they're not but it's thousands and it
[43:41.080 --> 43:48.240]  turns out for a decade or more they just issue other people social security
[43:48.240 --> 43:51.520]  numbers the government just pulls up social security numbers the state of
[43:51.520 --> 43:56.080]  Texas does and these school districts do and they just give the and then and then
[43:56.080 --> 44:01.240]  these people go these illegal aliens that are employed by the school districts
[44:01.240 --> 44:05.800]  to cook the food and mow the lawns and even be teacher assistants in some cases
[44:05.800 --> 44:09.600]  teachers they get to even use those social security numbers and they get
[44:09.600 --> 44:13.640]  benefits and then the people who they've stolen them from the government
[44:13.640 --> 44:18.400]  stolen them from just have no recourse on their credit or anything else and so
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.440]  over and over again separate agencies kept telling him to stop it and they
[44:23.440 --> 44:29.440]  just not gonna stop it and that's the way it is and then I ran across another
[44:29.440 --> 44:37.360]  article today in the news this is out of the Houston Chronicle a systems fatal
[44:37.360 --> 44:43.520]  flaws oh it's a fatal flaw kind of like when NASA just got caught faking all the
[44:43.520 --> 44:48.040]  temperature readings from weather services around the world just completely
[44:48.040 --> 44:52.280]  faking them over and over again they called it a mistake you know to say
[44:52.280 --> 44:59.520]  it's the hottest year on record when it's actually one of the coldest it's
[44:59.520 --> 45:02.600]  always a mistake you want to swatting does your house and kills you it's a
[45:02.600 --> 45:07.360]  mistake thousands of inmates admit they're in the US illegally but even
[45:07.360 --> 45:11.120]  those convicted of violent crimes are often released right back onto Houston
[45:11.120 --> 45:15.280]  streets I remember a story three years ago that said 400,000 violent offenders
[45:15.280 --> 45:20.040]  were released in one year in Houston oh yeah Houston's about 8 million people
[45:20.040 --> 45:25.000]  6 million the city 2 million metro about half illegal alien literally go down
[45:25.000 --> 45:31.000]  there and and you know I mean there's cases where they'll rape or kill scores
[45:31.000 --> 45:37.720]  of people you know that the railway serial killer all these people and it's
[45:37.720 --> 45:41.480]  not it's every criminal in Mexico knows this is the happy hunting ground you

[45:54.480 --> 45:58.720]  release some of your rest and don't arrest them so they illegal aliens have
[45:58.720 --> 46:03.920]  wrecks drunk no license no nothing there nothing happens citizens are

[46:36.600 --> 46:40.320]  immigration officials allowed scores of violent criminal some ordered deported
[46:40.320 --> 46:43.760]  decades ago to walk away from Harris County jails despite the inmates
[46:43.760 --> 46:47.200]  admission the local authorities that they were in the country legally a
[46:47.200 --> 46:51.000]  Houston Chronicle investigation found a review of thousands of criminal and
[46:51.000 --> 46:54.480]  immigration record shows that immigration and customs enforcement officers
[46:54.480 --> 46:59.720]  didn't file the paperwork to detain roughly 75% of more than 3500 this is a
[46:59.720 --> 47:03.960]  total whitewash books inmates who told jailers during the booking process that
[47:03.960 --> 47:09.600]  they were in the US illegally again this is a government that isn't a
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.820]  government it the laws are for us let me explain something I've got the news

[47:19.760 --> 47:23.520]  and the IRS when they need money just come and say well we don't care if you
[47:23.520 --> 47:26.520]  paid us what you were supposed to we're gonna go ahead and assess you a bunch
[47:26.520 --> 47:30.960]  of fines and fees we got to give it to the foreign banks we got to give it for
[47:30.960 --> 47:38.080]  welfare of the illegal aliens we got to have it and so they are taking houses

[48:27.200 --> 48:32.160]  it isn't government it's a private holding company government acts as the
[48:32.160 --> 48:37.960]  nozzle on a vacuum cleaner sucking up everything and it's growing like cancer
[48:37.960 --> 48:43.640]  government tripled in the last eight years and Obama's probably gonna triple
[48:43.640 --> 48:47.520]  it again everything else is going to implode and all we are going to be is a
[48:47.520 --> 48:51.040]  giant third-world country with a bunch of people running around in black
[48:51.040 --> 48:54.880]  uniforms and environmental outfits telling us what to do and regulating us

[51:10.120 --> 51:14.440]  long course of American history a terrorist act of war against this
[51:14.440 --> 51:19.000]  country. The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[51:19.000 --> 51:23.400]  bin Laden. This is his ammo. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to the
[51:23.400 --> 51:27.840]  Osama bin Laden. Fabled enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at
[51:27.840 --> 51:31.960]  the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some
[51:31.960 --> 51:35.880]  US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in
[51:35.880 --> 51:41.520]  spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been
[51:41.520 --> 51:46.320]  detained. In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the
[51:46.320 --> 51:49.960]  Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war
[51:49.960 --> 51:54.640]  games, the shadow government, and much much more. Fabled enemies get the DVD at

[52:06.920 --> 52:12.640]  Ionic Zone has the lowest prices in the USA on shock treatment ozone
[52:12.640 --> 52:18.040]  generators starting at $299. Ionic Zone shock treatment ozone generators are
[52:18.040 --> 52:21.800]  used by remediation contractors and homeowners alike to sterilize homes
[52:21.800 --> 52:26.400]  and cars, making them free from bacteria, molds, viruses, and complete removal of
[52:26.400 --> 52:30.680]  secondhand smoke. Pet owners, you name it. What else can three oxygen atoms, in
[52:30.680 --> 52:34.760]  other words, ozone do? Many hospitals sterilize their operating rooms with
[52:34.760 --> 52:38.920]  ozone before and after operations. And have you ever heard of ozone therapy?
[52:38.920 --> 52:43.920]  Ionic Zone has a wealth of information on ozone therapy. Ozone therapy is used
[52:43.920 --> 52:48.320]  among other things to raise the body's oxygen level, which studies suggest boost
[52:48.320 --> 52:52.880]  the immune system. You can learn more about ozone therapy or Ionic Zone ozone

[53:11.480 --> 53:16.400]  You see, a lot of people know what's the big deal of police checkpoints, what's the
[53:16.400 --> 53:21.200]  big deal of black uniforms and cameras. So what? I've done nothing wrong. Oh no,
[53:21.200 --> 53:24.840]  that's not what it's about. The surveillance, the secret arrest, the
[53:24.840 --> 53:31.680]  prisons. It's about stealing from the middle class. See, tyranny is about
[53:31.680 --> 53:37.000]  suppressing you while they rob you. They always have nice excuses for it. See,
[53:37.000 --> 53:41.960]  that's why tyranny isn't fun. See, Americans have seen Hollywood kind of make
[53:41.960 --> 53:46.160]  it look glamorous. Well, you're gonna find out how glamorous it is. Get ready.
[53:46.160 --> 53:50.920]  They're gonna squeeze you till your eyes pop out. And by the way, they're not
[53:50.920 --> 53:54.800]  gonna audit government workers. They're not gonna audit their own people. Just
[53:54.800 --> 54:00.160]  like in California, 994,000 people can't get tickets, can't be arrested,
[54:00.160 --> 54:05.760]  basically for anything other than like murders. Because the computers, cameras,
[54:05.760 --> 54:10.680]  aren't even allowed to scan their license plates. They're above the law. They are
[54:10.680 --> 54:16.640]  the gods of our earth now. They are the tyranny. They are the tyrants. Charles in
[54:16.640 --> 54:25.160]  California, you're on the air. Go ahead. Rough time. I'm basically wondering in
[54:25.160 --> 54:30.440]  the event of two points and questions, I guess, but in the event of, let's say,
[54:30.440 --> 54:38.400]  World War three commas, right? And which everything's pointing to that. What
[54:38.400 --> 54:42.800]  few countries? I mean, you've got a lot of information coming to you, a
[54:42.800 --> 54:48.480]  lot of informed people. So my question to you is as a backup plan, say FEMA doesn't
[54:48.480 --> 54:52.640]  take over all the airports yet. And I do want to leave this country. What three,
[54:52.640 --> 54:57.920]  four countries do you know of that? I mean, you know, there's no silver bullet
[54:57.920 --> 55:01.960]  obviously, but what few countries would be the best to maybe look at? The New
[55:01.960 --> 55:06.040]  World Order is everywhere. We know this. They are, I mean, listen, they're
[55:06.040 --> 55:09.800]  announcing now, if you're gonna fly to England or England's gonna fly from
[55:09.800 --> 55:13.240]  England, you have to register with Homeland Security three days before.
[55:13.240 --> 55:18.280]  She no longer do you fill out a customs card? They decide. So now you see there's
[55:18.280 --> 55:22.240]  there's no leave, there's no come in list, but the illegal aliens can commit
[55:22.240 --> 55:27.760]  violent felonies and are released. It's about us, the producer. You understand? We,
[55:27.760 --> 55:34.040]  we are literally what's for dinner. We're the suckling pigs they roast and put on
[55:34.040 --> 55:39.040]  the table and the whole grid's going into place worldwide. Listen, World War
[55:39.040 --> 55:43.120]  three is already here. It's economic against the people and the war on
[55:43.120 --> 55:47.840]  terror is the war on the people. It's the physical end, then the phony
[55:47.840 --> 55:52.000]  environmental banking collapse and environmental regulation is the other
[55:52.000 --> 55:56.440]  side of the Spencer attack. I agree with everything you're saying, but you did
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.600]  mention yesterday how, you know, if you weren't selfish and you, I mean, if you
[56:00.600 --> 56:04.240]  were selfish and you weren't, you know, doing what you're doing, that you would
[56:04.240 --> 56:08.480]  leave this country. So what I'm asking you is which country would that be? Which
[56:08.480 --> 56:14.160]  few countries were you looking at or would look at? Well, I would only leave, I
[56:14.160 --> 56:18.320]  would only leave because I'm high up on the list for, for somebody they grab.
[56:18.320 --> 56:27.160]  By the way, go ahead and get Salante on, go ahead and call him. I would, see, it's
[56:27.160 --> 56:32.920]  different for every person. I'm saying because I'm so high up in the food chain
[56:32.920 --> 56:37.360]  in the fight that I'm a major target if they really go into a hot war against
[56:37.360 --> 56:40.800]  the people. I mean, it's low intensity attacks on us right now and they're
[56:40.800 --> 56:44.760]  slowly turning the heat up with the ambient background, silent weapons
[56:44.760 --> 56:48.320]  system, you know, where the neighbor gets grabbed or the neighbor's kid gets
[56:48.320 --> 56:51.880]  grabbed or the neighbor dies of cancer at 25 or the neighbor gets Alzheimer's at
[56:51.880 --> 56:56.960]  30. You know, you know, there's soft kills all around us, but they got to slowly
[56:56.960 --> 56:59.800]  turn the heat up so their own zombie minions don't notice what they're part
[56:59.800 --> 57:02.280]  of. See, they're under mind control. They've been incrementally brought into
[57:02.280 --> 57:19.880]  this. I mean, as bad as it is, rural areas of Mexico, Costa Rica, I know a lot
[57:19.880 --> 57:23.920]  of big money's going to the Cook Islands. You know, it all depends how much
[57:23.920 --> 57:27.240]  money you've got. A lot of people have private
[57:27.240 --> 57:34.120]  fortresses in the Bahamas. A lot of big money goes to Switzerland, Spain,
[57:34.120 --> 57:38.800]  Portugal. I mean, if you're somebody who isn't high up on the hip, see, here's the
[57:38.800 --> 57:41.920]  problem. They changed the rules two years ago where we can't even get our
[57:41.920 --> 57:45.080]  money out. See, they got all their money out. Now they won't let anybody with
[57:45.080 --> 57:48.040]  even a little bit of money get out.

[57:58.040 --> 58:03.960]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to
[58:03.960 --> 58:08.040]  Grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did.
[58:08.040 --> 58:12.680]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a
[58:12.680 --> 58:19.840]  platform to tell their story. Whitman, EVA director on the 18th, made a
[58:19.840 --> 58:25.480]  statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing
[58:25.480 --> 58:29.960]  momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against
[58:29.960 --> 58:33.760]  their global masters. He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a
[58:33.760 --> 58:40.240]  countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[58:40.240 --> 58:44.920]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at
[58:44.920 --> 58:50.440]  PrisonPlanet.tv and aggressively spread it worldwide. Or order the DVD at
[58:50.440 --> 58:54.760]  infowars.com. If we don't expose the government-sponsored terror, they're
[58:54.760 --> 58:59.040]  going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[58:59.040 --> 59:09.040]  Waging War on Corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[59:12.040 --> 59:20.040]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[59:20.040 --> 59:28.040]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[59:28.040 --> 59:36.320]  Alex Jones. All right, already into hour number two. We have Stock Market Analysts
[59:36.320 --> 59:40.720]  International Television Host Max Kaiser joining us coming up in about an hour
[59:40.720 --> 59:47.360]  and a half. We're gonna have open phones in this hour for our guest. And he can
[59:47.360 --> 59:50.780]  talk about any issues so the folks don't hold. You can talk to him as well. He's
[59:50.780 --> 59:55.200]  Gerald Salente. I'm really honored to have him with us. We wrote a story at
[59:55.200 --> 1:00:00.600]  PrisonPlanet.com last week titled, Salente predicts revolution, food riots,
[1:00:00.600 --> 1:00:05.600]  tax rebellions by 2012. He goes on international television, national
[1:00:05.600 --> 1:00:11.120]  television, Fox, CNN, you name it. He is one of the, if not the most accurate,
[1:00:11.120 --> 1:00:15.480]  because I've been following him for more than a decade, people predicting trends.
[1:00:15.480 --> 1:00:19.680]  They call him a trend forecaster. I would call him a futurist, but I'm just
[1:00:19.680 --> 1:00:23.320]  seeing where things are going. And he makes a lot of the similar predictions we
[1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:27.560]  make, but I tend to just read UN think tank documents, Rand Corporation, where
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:30.760]  they say what they're going to do. He said, there will be a revolution in this
[1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:34.360]  country and it's not going to come yet, but it's going to come down the line and
[1:00:34.360 --> 1:00:39.560]  we're going to see a third party. And that's the catalyst for it. The takeover
[1:00:39.560 --> 1:00:44.200]  of Washington DC and broad daylight by Wall Street in a bloodless coup. And then
[1:00:44.200 --> 1:00:47.720]  he goes into talking about basically riots and homelessness and complete
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:52.480]  breakdown of society. And so joining us for the next hour is Gerald Salente to
[1:00:52.480 --> 1:00:56.680]  talk about a host of issues and get where he thinks we're going in the
[1:00:56.680 --> 1:01:01.080]  future. And of course, you can also link through and go to his website,
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:07.560]  trendsresearch.com. Gerald Salente, thanks for coming on. Hey, Alex. Thank you for
[1:01:07.560 --> 1:01:11.920]  having me. You bet. We got three minutes before we break, but just lay out in the
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:17.080]  first three minutes a little bit about yourself and what trend research is. Well,
[1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:22.200]  current events form future trends. So we look at the major social economic
[1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:27.160]  political, geopolitical, environmental consumer. We look at over 300 different
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:32.600]  categories on a daily basis worldwide, looking for those major trends that are
[1:01:32.600 --> 1:01:37.160]  shaping the future. For example, the current event today that everyone should
[1:01:37.160 --> 1:01:43.040]  know about is what city group announced they're firing 50,000 people. I mean,
[1:01:43.040 --> 1:01:48.160]  they're not going to make those jobs up in the circuit city of Starbucks. So we
[1:01:48.160 --> 1:01:54.040]  look at this data and we analyze it, but we do so as political atheists. We're
[1:01:54.040 --> 1:01:57.320]  not, we will be both of these parties, you know, we have nothing to do with them.
[1:01:57.320 --> 1:02:02.360]  And so we look at events for what they are and not the way we want them to be.
[1:02:02.360 --> 1:02:07.160]  And that's what really stops a lot of people from seeing the future. The other
[1:02:07.160 --> 1:02:12.400]  thing is when you look at economic forecasts, political forecasts, they do
[1:02:12.400 --> 1:02:17.160]  it one dimensionally. They don't look at all the other interlocking fields. Yes.
[1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:22.200]  So that's what we do differently than most others. The system that we have, we
[1:02:22.200 --> 1:02:27.320]  call global nomic. It means including the entire world from the word
[1:02:27.320 --> 1:02:32.920]  globus and nemine to manage because trends can be managed. You can see what's
[1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:37.520]  happening and then take the measures necessary to protect yourself or to
[1:02:37.520 --> 1:02:44.160]  profit from what the future may bring. Absolutely. When we come back, I want to
[1:02:44.160 --> 1:02:48.440]  get into the fact that the NSA uses its snooping system, not so much to even
[1:02:48.440 --> 1:02:53.200]  quote, spy on the individual, but to see major trends and try to get ahead of it,
[1:02:53.200 --> 1:02:57.440]  to control it, and to give that info to select inner group corporations. The
[1:02:57.440 --> 1:03:00.800]  government, the big corporations, they know what you and I know, Gerald, and what
[1:03:00.800 --> 1:03:05.560]  you're so good at. They just don't like advertising real systems to the public.
[1:03:05.560 --> 1:03:10.640]  Well, yes and no, because we've worked with a number of the major corporations
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:15.640]  and that's our business, and I have to tell you, there are corporations like
[1:03:15.640 --> 1:03:20.640]  Ford, for example, they came to visit us in the 90s, and we thought
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:25.080]  we were talking to dead people. We said, why waste our time working with
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:29.800]  these people when we know that what we give them is not going to be implemented?
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:36.440]  So we assume that they know, but from our experience, Alex, most of them are
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:41.080]  well behind the curve, examples, you know, look at the major corporations today
[1:03:41.080 --> 1:03:45.480]  and how they're suffering at so many different levels. We're going to talk
[1:03:45.480 --> 1:03:49.200]  about that when we get back, and we're going to discuss the key, what you just
[1:03:49.200 --> 1:03:54.080]  said. People look at the world the way they want to see it. Ladies and gentlemen,
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.800]  that is delusion, that is a fraud. Don't you want to really know how the world
[1:03:58.800 --> 1:04:02.800]  works? Don't you really want to count, instead of having your thoughts fed to
[1:04:02.800 --> 1:04:08.400]  you? Gerald Salenti is our guest. We'll be right back for this quick break.
[1:04:08.400 --> 1:04:12.600]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones. I've told you for a long time it's important
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:15.880]  to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever. We need to be
[1:04:15.880 --> 1:04:19.440]  independent, and food and water is the key. You'll never have to stand in a
[1:04:19.440 --> 1:04:22.720]  bread line if you have your own bread. You'll never have to go to the Super
[1:04:22.720 --> 1:04:26.560]  Dome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if you
[1:04:26.560 --> 1:04:29.560]  simply prepare. Our elected representatives wanted a good old boy
[1:04:29.560 --> 1:04:33.400]  bailout for a special interest, so they ignored your screams not to do it. They
[1:04:33.400 --> 1:04:38.000]  turned off the telephones and email. They voted to print $850 billion at least
[1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:42.000]  out of thin air. This money now owns the American and European banks. The
[1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:45.800]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:49.840]  nothing and blast the cost of necessities, particularly food beyond many
[1:04:49.840 --> 1:04:54.080]  Americans reach. In pre-Nazi Germany's super inflation, the cost of a loaf of
[1:04:54.080 --> 1:04:58.320]  bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks. Food
[1:04:58.320 --> 1:05:02.080]  prices are skyrocketing so fast. There seems as if there may be no end in
[1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:05.800]  sight. The private banks, merging with our government, are refusing to loan
[1:05:05.800 --> 1:05:09.400]  grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves. The stores have less food
[1:05:09.400 --> 1:05:13.560]  but jack up prices to stay in business. Whatever happens in America, we need to
[1:05:13.560 --> 1:05:17.600]  be prepared and be ready. Everything is zeroing in on food. One third of Americans
[1:05:17.600 --> 1:05:21.240]  have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities. My friends,
[1:05:21.240 --> 1:05:25.640]  whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food. For everybody out
[1:05:25.640 --> 1:05:28.680]  there listening, it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply
[1:05:28.680 --> 1:05:32.400]  of storable food, the government, the new old order has a lot less control over you
[1:05:32.400 --> 1:05:36.680]  and so it's a mindset, a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness. No one
[1:05:36.680 --> 1:05:39.880]  is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you. You know
[1:05:39.880 --> 1:05:43.880]  eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,
[1:05:43.880 --> 1:05:47.680]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half
[1:05:47.680 --> 1:05:53.440]  the cost of last year's grocery prices. Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web go

[1:06:18.120 --> 1:06:23.720]  Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[1:06:23.720 --> 1:06:31.080]  mind. There's not a better trend forecaster than Gerald Salente. The man knows what he's
[1:06:31.080 --> 1:06:36.320]  talking about CNBC. Gerald Salente has a knack for getting the zeitgeist right.
[1:06:36.320 --> 1:06:41.640]  USA Today, Economist magazine wrote that he has a network of 25 experts who
[1:06:41.640 --> 1:06:47.880]  range of specialties with rival many university faculties. When CNN
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:52.480]  wants to know about top trends, we asked Gerald Salente. It goes on and on.
[1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:57.160]  Gerald, I want to get into how you integrate all these different sectors
[1:06:57.160 --> 1:07:00.840]  of the economy, the society, how you come up with your trends that have turned
[1:07:00.840 --> 1:07:05.520]  out to be so accurate. But before we do that, perhaps we should get the
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:10.080]  listeners who don't know who you are to learn a little bit about Gerald Salente,
[1:07:10.080 --> 1:07:13.720]  how you got into this particular field and became a leader in it or the leader
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:20.120]  in it. And basically, some of the predictions that you've made that have
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:25.000]  been so accurate and where you see us going, you know, fleshing out the
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:29.560]  discussions that you've had about basically complete breakdown of society
[1:07:29.560 --> 1:07:34.760]  and martial law type scenarios. Well, the way I began my career after graduate
[1:07:34.760 --> 1:07:41.240]  school, I managed the mayoral campaign for the fellow running for office in
[1:07:41.240 --> 1:07:48.800]  Yonkers, New York, and it was 1971. And from there, they sent me up to Albany. I
[1:07:48.800 --> 1:07:53.360]  did such a great job. And I was the assistant to the Secretary of the New
[1:07:53.360 --> 1:07:58.240]  York State Senate, which, by the way, was the worst job I ever had. You know, it's
[1:07:58.240 --> 1:08:03.640]  a disgusting spectacle to see grown men grovel, particularly from a kid that was
[1:08:03.640 --> 1:08:08.160]  grown up in the Bronx. And, you know, you'd watch all these people. I'd be
[1:08:08.160 --> 1:08:11.920]  talking to a buddy, you know, and we'd be in the chambers and the Senate
[1:08:11.920 --> 1:08:15.720]  chambers and the senator would walk in. My buddy would leave me to go help the
[1:08:15.720 --> 1:08:20.200]  senator sit down, you know, pull his chair out, you know. So my friend would come
[1:08:20.200 --> 1:08:23.960]  back, I'd say, what's the matter? You know, the guy can't sit down on his own. He
[1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:29.080]  needs some help. So that was my, I got to see the insides of government. From
[1:08:29.080 --> 1:08:33.680]  there, I went to St. John's University and I taught probably one of the
[1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:39.520]  nation's first courses in American politics and campaign technology in 1972.
[1:08:39.520 --> 1:08:44.840]  From there, I went to Chicago and I was a government affairs specialist working
[1:08:44.840 --> 1:08:48.200]  for segments of the chemical industry and other parts of the industry and
[1:08:48.200 --> 1:08:53.960]  between Washington and Chicago. As a matter of fact, I was in DC when the
[1:08:53.960 --> 1:09:02.600]  first energy crisis hit in 1973. Jimmy Carter later becomes president and the
[1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:07.000]  Iranian conflict breaks out. And I had been following this thing for years,
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:10.360]  Alex, you know, I knew how the CIA overthrew the democratically elected
[1:09:10.360 --> 1:09:16.400]  government of Iran, Mosa-Dag, and on and on and how the Safak, the secret police
[1:09:16.400 --> 1:09:21.880]  of the Shah, was only second to the SS, you know, was a brutal regime. When the
[1:09:21.880 --> 1:09:27.720]  revolution started to happen in Iran, I knew it was real because I knew of the
[1:09:27.720 --> 1:09:32.560]  pent-up hatred that they had against this guy. Jimmy Carter goes to spend
[1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:37.200]  New Year's Eve with the Shah and his wife and he and Roslyn. And in those days
[1:09:37.200 --> 1:09:41.200]  when the president came back from overseas, it was a big deal. He walks up to
[1:09:41.200 --> 1:09:44.640]  the microphones after saluting out and walking out of the helicopter on the
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:48.440]  White House lawn. And Jimmy Carter announced to the American people that
[1:09:48.440 --> 1:09:54.760]  the Shah was the island of stability in the Middle East. At that moment, I became
[1:09:54.760 --> 1:09:59.600]  a political atheist. I'd been around long enough, I knew the game. And then the
[1:09:59.600 --> 1:10:04.800]  second thing that hit me was what will be the implications of what's going on.
[1:10:04.800 --> 1:10:10.680]  And I realized that gold and oil prices would increase. So I started to
[1:10:10.680 --> 1:10:15.320]  speculate in both those fields. And I was only a kid, I was in my early 30s, you
[1:10:15.320 --> 1:10:19.480]  know, and I didn't know what the hell I was doing. But I did know enough that I
[1:10:19.480 --> 1:10:23.680]  knew that the American public was getting one story and there was a whole
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:28.920]  other story on the international scene. I made enough money from that where I
[1:10:28.920 --> 1:10:34.040]  quit my job. And that's when I began the Trends Research Institute in 1980.
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:39.320]  Always under the understanding that current events form future
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:44.240]  trends. But if I look at them, as you said going into the break, without
[1:10:44.240 --> 1:10:48.360]  looking at them the way I want them to be, the way I wish them or hope them to
[1:10:48.360 --> 1:10:54.160]  be, and just the way they are, and let the data speak for itself, then you can
[1:10:54.160 --> 1:11:00.520]  see a clear direction of where the future is heading. And you know, it's like
[1:11:00.520 --> 1:11:05.840]  going to a doctor. You get a diagnosis. But you don't call the doctor an SOB if
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:10.240]  you don't like his economic or political diagnosis. You accept it for what it is
[1:11:10.240 --> 1:11:15.120]  and work from that parameter. And that's what we do. We see the trends, the
[1:11:15.120 --> 1:11:20.200]  way they're laying out in front of us, where they're going to go, and then we
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:26.440]  work around that direction, not trying to redirect it in our minds so that we
[1:11:26.440 --> 1:11:30.920]  hope for something different. Well, now specifically, because we have limited
[1:11:30.920 --> 1:11:33.720]  time when we can talk to you for 10 hours, you've got so much information
[1:11:33.720 --> 1:11:37.120]  briefly. I know you don't like to brag, but no brag, just fact, as John Wayne
[1:11:37.120 --> 1:11:41.640]  would say, break down some of the predictions and trends, the projections
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:45.120]  that you've made that have unfortunately come true. And I say
[1:11:45.120 --> 1:11:51.200]  unfortunately, because your analysis is pretty much identical to mine and many
[1:11:51.200 --> 1:11:55.320]  other experts I'm interviewing about on the good side, total depression,
[1:11:55.320 --> 1:12:00.800]  breakdown of society, police state, on the bad side, road warrior,
[1:12:00.800 --> 1:12:09.640]  Mad Max, you know, 10,000 BC, just lawless third world bans of, I mean,
[1:12:09.640 --> 1:12:11.920]  that's what you're talking about now. And that's where all the trends are
[1:12:11.920 --> 1:12:15.520]  headed, and government is doing everything it can to accentuate that.
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:18.280]  So let's break down some of your track record and then get into what's
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:20.880]  happening currently, and then into the future, sir.
[1:12:20.880 --> 1:12:27.120]  Well, I guess my first big forecast came in 1980, actually, it was January of
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:33.760]  1987, and I had predicted that there'd be a stock market crash that year, and
[1:12:33.760 --> 1:12:39.520]  Wall Street Journal gave me credit for that one as well. From there, the next
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:45.280]  big one was with, I had, in my book, Trend Tracking, as a matter of fact, I
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:50.080]  came out and said there would be a new third party. This was in 1988, and for
[1:12:50.080 --> 1:12:54.360]  some reason I said that Ross Perot would be the type of candidate that
[1:12:54.360 --> 1:12:57.520]  would head this kind of party, and in those days, nobody knew who
[1:12:57.520 --> 1:13:03.160]  Ross Perot was. From there, my other big forecast in the consumer end had to
[1:13:03.160 --> 1:13:10.920]  do with gourmet coffees, the organic foods, water, in the early 80s, a big
[1:13:10.920 --> 1:13:16.200]  water trend bottled water, a whole variety of natural healing trends.
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:21.760]  Matter of fact, one of the early books I worked on in 1986 was called Natural
[1:13:21.760 --> 1:13:25.800]  Healing. So I got a very good understanding of that field as well, and
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:29.680]  again, this is what really differentiates me from a lot of the other trend
[1:13:29.680 --> 1:13:34.120]  forecasts is in that I get involved in a lot of the fields where I see things
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:39.820]  going and understand them at a different level. So those are some of the
[1:13:39.820 --> 1:13:44.520]  things. Then, back going into the economic crisis, we had then forecast
[1:13:44.520 --> 1:13:52.480]  the 1990 recession, how long it would last, and the 1997 foreign currency
[1:13:52.480 --> 1:13:59.280]  crisis, the dot-com crash in our Trends Journal we said in October 1999, that by
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:04.880]  the second quarter of 2000, we would have the dot-com bubble would burst, then
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:11.960]  the ensuing recession, and then this past November 7th, we took out the domain
[1:14:11.960 --> 1:14:17.840]  name Panicof08.com, and we knew that there would be the Panicof08, and we
[1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:22.920]  also said that they're in our Top Trends for 2008, which came out on December
[1:14:22.920 --> 1:14:30.600]  17th, 2007. We said that there would be an economic 9-11. And now we see that
[1:14:30.600 --> 1:14:36.720]  unfolding. What do you see breaking down the next three years? How do you see it
[1:14:36.720 --> 1:14:42.680]  unfolding? Now again, folks, this is general. It can go from bad to
[1:14:42.680 --> 1:14:46.920]  worse, or you can say the good, the bad, and the ugly. What is the best case
[1:14:46.920 --> 1:14:51.040]  scenario versus the worst case scenario? I mean, take that question any way you
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:56.080]  want. Those are just general thoughts I have. Well, and let me back up too, because
[1:14:56.080 --> 1:14:59.960]  you know, I'm only, we're only human here, and we don't see everything, and we
[1:14:59.960 --> 1:15:05.800]  don't make all the calls properly. In the 1990s, for example, we underestimated
[1:15:05.800 --> 1:15:12.760]  around 1993, 1994, the impact of the computer revolution and the
[1:15:12.760 --> 1:15:17.600]  technology boom. Any of us that remember back then, you know, it was still in its
[1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:22.160]  infancy. And so, and they had that law, I forget which was the name of the law,
[1:15:22.160 --> 1:15:28.340]  where things increased at an exponential rate in technology far
[1:15:28.340 --> 1:15:34.600]  beyond what we had ever anticipated. So that's what's got us out of the 1990s
[1:15:34.600 --> 1:15:41.160]  recession, because we should have been in the shape we are in now back then, had
[1:15:41.160 --> 1:15:46.240]  it not been for that technological boom. Now, with the... But isn't it also, I mean,
[1:15:46.240 --> 1:15:50.120]  I understand for time where we're simplifying, but also they changed the
[1:15:50.120 --> 1:15:56.600]  banking rules in 93, 95, 99 to allow intensified fractional reserve banking
[1:15:56.600 --> 1:16:00.840]  and leveraging. So that also helped the bubble along. That helped the bubble along,
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:04.680]  and that created the big bubble that burst that we're in now, as you well know.
[1:16:04.680 --> 1:16:10.400]  Yeah. So, but just to give you the scenarios, yeah, we're saying we're
[1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:14.560]  going to go into a depression worse than the Great Depression, and here's why.
[1:16:14.560 --> 1:16:18.320]  And then I'm going to tell you why it cannot happen, or it may not happen. Yeah,
[1:16:18.320 --> 1:16:21.920]  I mean, there is a way to get out of this. There is a way to get out of it, but not
[1:16:21.920 --> 1:16:26.720]  through fiscal and monetary stimulus. If we have an alternative break energy
[1:16:26.720 --> 1:16:32.200]  breakthrough beyond solar wind, geothermal, biofuel that they like to talk about,
[1:16:32.200 --> 1:16:37.200]  whether it's something in coal fusion, zero point energy, charge cost is permanent
[1:16:37.200 --> 1:16:42.760]  magnets, hydrino power, something like that, that's a productive enhancement that
[1:16:42.760 --> 1:16:47.320]  is big as the discovery of fire or the invention of the wheel. Then we get out
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:52.520]  of this economic mess. A whole new market, a paradigm shifting development. You're
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:56.960]  saying minus that, we're in deep trouble. Minus that, we're going to go into the
[1:16:56.960 --> 1:17:03.040]  greatest depression, and here's why. Back when we had the last depression, most
[1:17:03.040 --> 1:17:06.160]  people didn't own homes. They didn't have all this burden that they're carrying now
[1:17:06.160 --> 1:17:11.080]  with taxes and everything else, insurance. Back then, people didn't have home equity
[1:17:11.080 --> 1:17:14.640]  loans. Matter of fact, we're probably both old enough to know when people had
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:19.480]  something called second mortgages, they were called losers. Back then, people
[1:17:19.480 --> 1:17:24.840]  didn't have credit cards. They weren't over $14 trillion in debt. Back then, the
[1:17:24.840 --> 1:17:29.760]  government had a trade surplus. We were not $700 billion in the whole week.
[1:17:29.760 --> 1:17:36.040]  And the people were self-sufficient. And the people were self-sufficient. Back then,
[1:17:36.040 --> 1:17:40.880]  the government was not spending, what, $11.5 trillion in
[1:17:40.880 --> 1:17:46.880]  growing in the whole with a budget deficit. Back then, we had budget
[1:17:46.880 --> 1:17:53.560]  surpluses. Back then, we weren't costing us over $2 trillion to fight wars. Back
[1:17:53.560 --> 1:17:59.320]  then, we had a manufacturing base that when the depression finally did
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:04.640]  end with the onset of World War II, we were able to manufacture our cells out
[1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:07.600]  of it, and then later on, the rest of the world.

[1:22:49.120 --> 1:22:52.120]  holding over from earlier, but it's all on the same subject. What's happening to

[1:22:57.120 --> 1:23:04.120]  the line. Going back to Gerald Salente. Gerald, you were going over why we're
[1:23:04.120 --> 1:23:10.120]  in such a much more precarious and weak and debilitated position than the people
[1:23:10.120 --> 1:23:15.120]  that went through the 10 years of the Great Depression and then forecasting
[1:23:15.120 --> 1:23:18.120]  where we're going in the future. Please continue.
[1:23:18.120 --> 1:23:22.120]  Yeah, the other thing too, and by the way, the one that you pointed out as well
[1:23:22.120 --> 1:23:28.120]  is very, very important. The people are more self-sufficient than they are now.
[1:23:28.120 --> 1:23:35.120]  This is like a baby state in so many ways. And people looking for help from
[1:23:35.120 --> 1:23:41.120]  the government, my God, Katrina Quality Rescue Skills. What are they looking at?
[1:23:41.120 --> 1:23:48.120]  So the other things too is back then people didn't have 401Ks and IRAs that
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:54.120]  were their future evaporating right before them. And the other thing that
[1:23:54.120 --> 1:23:59.120]  people need to know was during the Depression, you know, we didn't have
[1:23:59.120 --> 1:24:03.120]  the, you know, you can do some of these work project things that they talk
[1:24:03.120 --> 1:24:07.120]  about. You know, we didn't have these deficits that we have now. So to keep
[1:24:07.120 --> 1:24:12.120]  talking about stimulus packages, to keep talking about work project packages,
[1:24:12.120 --> 1:24:18.120]  where is this money going to come from? And again, as every historian or
[1:24:18.120 --> 1:24:24.120]  economist knows, the only thing that got us out of that depression was World
[1:24:24.120 --> 1:24:30.120]  War II. So having said that, we are looking now in the short term, here's
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:35.120]  the scenario that we see unfolding before we get to the riots and the
[1:24:35.120 --> 1:24:41.120]  tax revolts and the increasing crime, which is already beginning to happen.
[1:24:41.120 --> 1:24:48.120]  Oh, yeah. What we're going to see is after, we think the real breakdown is going
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:54.120]  to begin in February. That's our forecast. Because in February, we're going to
[1:24:54.120 --> 1:24:59.120]  now realize the shock of what has happened from a disappointing, disappointing
[1:24:59.120 --> 1:25:04.120]  is putting it lightly, Christmas holiday retail season.
[1:25:04.120 --> 1:25:10.120]  And you think the Obama, you know, hope will fade by then as well?
[1:25:10.120 --> 1:25:14.120]  Yes. For a lot of people, it's going to fade for the people that have lost
[1:25:14.120 --> 1:25:19.120]  everything. For example, as I said, City Corp today announced they're laying
[1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:24.120]  off, how many, 50,000 people. You go to all of these places around the
[1:25:24.120 --> 1:25:29.120]  country, like the Carolina's, we had Wachovia and all these banking
[1:25:29.120 --> 1:25:35.120]  centers, financial centers, people living in their McMansions and having
[1:25:35.120 --> 1:25:39.120]  these huge, huge mortgages. I mean, they're going to become McBording
[1:25:39.120 --> 1:25:43.120]  houses as they try to get people in there so they could pay the rent and pay
[1:25:43.120 --> 1:25:48.120]  the taxes and pay the utilities. So we're going to see people out on the
[1:25:48.120 --> 1:25:52.120]  streets. You know, these things called self-storage units, they're going to
[1:25:52.120 --> 1:25:56.120]  take on the true meaning. Cells are going to be storing themselves in there
[1:25:56.120 --> 1:26:00.120]  because they're not going to be, you know, it's better than living in a tent
[1:26:00.120 --> 1:26:04.120]  as these 10 cities are sprouting up all over the country or sleeping out in
[1:26:04.120 --> 1:26:10.120]  the streets or sleeping in a homeless shelter. So we think it's going to be
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:15.120]  February because the real dad is going to come in to show how really bad this
[1:26:15.120 --> 1:26:20.120]  is. Having said that, there's still going to be the element of hope that
[1:26:20.120 --> 1:26:24.120]  Obama is going to be able to do something and being that they're painting
[1:26:24.120 --> 1:26:32.120]  him as an FDR and cloaking him in that mantle, get ready for a bank holiday
[1:26:32.120 --> 1:26:37.120]  because we're going to see runs on the banks that are going to come that
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:42.120]  there's no, they're not going to be able to cover them anymore. And I love
[1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:47.120]  the terminology Alex that they use, you know, holiday, holiday, you know,
[1:26:47.120 --> 1:26:51.120]  they take it so beautiful. That means you're not going to get your money out
[1:26:51.120 --> 1:26:55.120]  of the bank and they're going to say, don't worry, it's FDIC insured.
[1:26:55.120 --> 1:27:01.120]  We just can't get it out all at once. So we are also in that camp by the way
[1:27:01.120 --> 1:27:06.120]  that we are going to see, even though it doesn't look like it now because of
[1:27:06.120 --> 1:27:12.120]  a variety of manipulations going on, we believe that gold is going to go
[1:27:12.120 --> 1:27:18.120]  into the 2000 range and we're going to see periods of deflation whereby all
[1:27:18.120 --> 1:27:23.120]  those homes out there are going to be worth a lot less than they are now
[1:27:23.120 --> 1:27:28.120]  and there's a glut of product everywhere, deflationary prices on one end
[1:27:28.120 --> 1:27:33.120]  and hyperinflation on the other. As I mentioned with February,
[1:27:33.120 --> 1:27:38.120]  because once all these retail outlets start closing, as we're already seeing
[1:27:38.120 --> 1:27:45.120]  with Circuit City, with Starbucks, it's going to be a glut of commercial real
[1:27:45.120 --> 1:27:48.120]  estate and that's the next shoe to fall.
[1:27:48.120 --> 1:27:52.120]  Alright, long segment coming up. I want to break down that over the next few years
[1:27:52.120 --> 1:27:57.120]  what he thinks government's response will be to this, why he thinks it will
[1:27:57.120 --> 1:28:02.120]  push the people into open rebellion. Our guest is Gerald Salunta.

[1:29:16.120 --> 1:29:23.120]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:27.120]  The enemies start America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:29:27.120 --> 1:29:29.120]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:29:29.120 --> 1:29:32.120]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:29:32.120 --> 1:29:39.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:29:39.120 --> 1:29:46.120]  Some US investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US.
[1:29:46.120 --> 1:29:50.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:29:50.120 --> 1:30:09.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.

[1:30:16.120 --> 1:30:24.120]  Heart disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[1:30:24.120 --> 1:30:34.120]  But the symptoms are there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes, and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[1:30:34.120 --> 1:30:40.120]  Here, how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[1:30:40.120 --> 1:30:44.120]  My blood pressure has normalized. My diabetes has totally improved.
[1:30:44.120 --> 1:30:51.120]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel. I recommend heart and body extract to everyone.
[1:30:51.120 --> 1:30:59.120]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[1:31:30.120 --> 1:31:39.120]  Hey, I was just talking to Gerald Salente during the break. He didn't tell me not to say this, but he'll probably get a seat in the FEMA camp for it, probably already will.
[1:31:39.120 --> 1:31:45.120]  But I didn't know he was aware of our work and said it was interesting.
[1:31:45.120 --> 1:31:55.120]  Well, let's just get from Gerald Salente. Because I'm interested, I'm really respecting what he thinks of the work we're doing here from the work of mine that he's seen.
[1:31:55.120 --> 1:32:03.120]  Mr. Salente? Yes, no, I've been following you for years and I admire you as a man of courage.
[1:32:03.120 --> 1:32:12.120]  In these times, not many people have it anymore and they're always towing the party line or afraid of the implications of what they say.
[1:32:12.120 --> 1:32:20.120]  And you've been a man that speaks out, you speak your mind and you're a man of your word and you're conviction. So what's not to admire?
[1:32:20.120 --> 1:32:29.120]  Well, I admire you, but I mean, look, with me, it's not even courage. And I would imagine it's the same with you because I talked to other people that'll speak out and trailblaze.
[1:32:29.120 --> 1:32:38.120]  I mean, why would you lie? I mean, all you've got is who you are and the truth. Money, power, things like that really don't matter to a well-centered person.
[1:32:38.120 --> 1:32:44.120]  The truth veritas is everything. So with me, it's not even courage. In a way, it's the opposite of courage.
[1:32:44.120 --> 1:32:57.120]  I have been so freaked out by what I saw coming historically because we repeat the same activities over and over again that it's actually been out of fear that I've been trying to change things and trying to warn people.
[1:32:57.120 --> 1:33:05.120]  And also, quote, brotherly love. I mean, I don't like seeing people be conned. I don't like seeing my fellow humans being hurt.
[1:33:05.120 --> 1:33:10.120]  I mean, why do you do what you do, Gerald? Because obviously, you put yourself at risk doing some of the things you do.
[1:33:10.120 --> 1:33:20.120]  Oh, yeah. No, listen, you know, it's funny when we talked about the failings of the Bush administration, we were called Bushbashers.
[1:33:20.120 --> 1:33:27.120]  Now we're being called Obamabashers, you know, but it's the price that you pay. And you said it, what's more than your word?
[1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:33.120]  I mean, for me, my belief is that when I take that last breath, I want to know that I was true to myself.
[1:33:33.120 --> 1:33:43.120]  There's a great saying, you know, that whether it's the Koran, the Bible, Jesus, Muhammad, or Buddha, there is no salvation for the hypocrite.
[1:33:43.120 --> 1:33:47.120]  You know, what's the sense of living if you're going to be a hypocrite.
[1:33:47.120 --> 1:33:58.120]  But, you know, as we're, but it really is a time for people, you know, as they say, you know, now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.
[1:33:58.120 --> 1:34:06.120]  And this is that time and we've never seen it more than this because there is going to be that period following.
[1:34:06.120 --> 1:34:14.120]  When the crime rates start going up, the first reaction is going to be send more police out into the streets.
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:18.120]  And so they're going to build up more and more of this.
[1:34:18.120 --> 1:34:25.120]  Again, you can call what's going on now with the government now controlling the world's largest insurance company,
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:28.120]  the world's largest mortgage brokerage.
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:37.120]  And now they're talking about taking over one of the largest auto companies and, of course, now they're buying into the banks.
[1:34:37.120 --> 1:34:45.120]  You could call this either socialism, communism, or fascism, but you cannot call it free enterprise or democracy.
[1:34:45.120 --> 1:34:47.120]  That's right. It's total command and control.
[1:34:47.120 --> 1:34:56.120]  And the break in a revenue, you were continuing to go through how you see this unfolding and just how bad it's going to get.
[1:34:56.120 --> 1:35:01.120]  So what we're looking at then is they're going to call a bank holiday, we believe.
[1:35:01.120 --> 1:35:08.120]  And we also believe that they're going to try the same thing that FDR did with confiscating gold.
[1:35:08.120 --> 1:35:17.120]  That'll be another thing because we're already hearing from the G20 members to re-institute some format of the Brentwoods Agreement,
[1:35:17.120 --> 1:35:20.120]  which, of course, gold was the standard.
[1:35:20.120 --> 1:35:29.120]  But, of course, there's too much money out there, so that means gold would probably be $6,000 or $60,000 an ounce.
[1:35:29.120 --> 1:35:31.120]  It would have a really, really high value.
[1:35:31.120 --> 1:35:34.120]  So we think that there's going to be that kind of confiscation.
[1:35:34.120 --> 1:35:38.120]  We think also that they're doing it already.
[1:35:38.120 --> 1:35:42.120]  They're squeezing the little people, and this is why there's going to be a revolt.
[1:35:42.120 --> 1:35:50.120]  You look at, go around the country, Alex, state after state, city after city, locality after locality.
[1:35:50.120 --> 1:35:54.120]  They're raising taxes to make up for lost revenues.
[1:35:54.120 --> 1:36:01.120]  How are the people going to pay these things when their median household income is well below 1999 levels,
[1:36:01.120 --> 1:36:05.120]  wages are falling behind, how are they losing their jobs?
[1:36:05.120 --> 1:36:06.120]  That's number one.
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:15.120]  Here in New York, what they're doing in the city is they just hired several hundred new traffic enforcement officers
[1:36:15.120 --> 1:36:23.120]  so that when you're driving in New York City and if your car goes into that white space between the lines where the pedestrian walks,
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:24.120]  you get a ticket.
[1:36:24.120 --> 1:36:31.120]  What they're doing is white-gloving everyone now, everywhere I drive in Austin, there's a cop every half mile.
[1:36:31.120 --> 1:36:34.120]  Now if you go a couple miles over the speed limit, they give you a ticket.
[1:36:34.120 --> 1:36:40.120]  Everything's being watched, but then they admit in major Texas papers that illegal aliens are above the law.
[1:36:40.120 --> 1:36:45.120]  They don't have to have any driver's license, insurance, nothing, only the citizens.
[1:36:45.120 --> 1:36:50.120]  And then meanwhile, traffic enforcement cops in New York have gotten in trouble because they drive the worst,
[1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:53.120]  they park wherever they want, they do whatever they want.
[1:36:53.120 --> 1:36:58.120]  They're just going to keep squeezing and squeezing, and now not just property taxes,
[1:36:58.120 --> 1:37:05.120]  they're saying, we're just going to assess you 20,000 bucks, everybody in the town, for new roads we're putting in.
[1:37:05.120 --> 1:37:08.120]  Government is going crazy. What's going to happen?
[1:37:08.120 --> 1:37:11.120]  This is why the revolt is going to take place.
[1:37:11.120 --> 1:37:12.120]  There's another one, too.
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:20.120]  They've unleashed all the people from the sales tax people, going to all the small shops, the pizza shops,
[1:37:20.120 --> 1:37:29.120]  the liquor stores, all the small people, and they're cracking down on them, making them pay more sales tax.
[1:37:29.120 --> 1:37:36.120]  IRS is going to go after more of the small people because the too big to fail is too big to control and too big to monitor.
[1:37:36.120 --> 1:37:44.120]  So this is where the revolution starts taking place because when you're hungry and when you're out of the job,
[1:37:44.120 --> 1:37:49.120]  and when you're out on the streets, you don't want to hear, yes, we can anymore.
[1:37:49.120 --> 1:37:52.120]  And that's what's going to happen.
[1:37:52.120 --> 1:37:59.120]  And the other thing that's going to happen as well is we believe that there's going to be a new third party
[1:37:59.120 --> 1:38:08.120]  formed around the same reasons the third parties were formed in the 19th century against the central bankers taking over the country.
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  And if anybody's not old enough to see what's happening or too blind to look, they better wake up.
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:22.120]  As we said in our trend alert recently, it was at D.C. Heist, they hijacked Washington.
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:25.120]  And you have Henry Paulson in there from Goldman Sachs.
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:29.120]  I love it, you know, the liberals, you know, they bash Bush and Cheney.
[1:38:29.120 --> 1:38:32.120]  You know that Cheney has ties to Halliburton.
[1:38:32.120 --> 1:38:40.120]  Yeah, how about, you know, who did Obama bring in as his new team, his transition team in there to live for the economy?
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:46.120]  Robert Rubin and Larry Summers. They're the guys that changed the rules to do all of this.
[1:38:46.120 --> 1:38:56.120]  Exactly. The other ones that put the nail in the Glass-Steagall Act that allowed the banksters to be running wild as they are now
[1:38:56.120 --> 1:39:01.120]  and also to put all these phony little gambling games like derivatives.
[1:39:01.120 --> 1:39:04.120]  Well, here's the $64 million question then.
[1:39:04.120 --> 1:39:11.120]  Why did Kashkari even go up before the House and basically admit they took the $5 trillion, not $700 billion?
[1:39:11.120 --> 1:39:13.120]  They're not telling anybody where it went.
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:15.120]  And then he started laughing at them.
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:24.120]  I mean, I've never even in modern history or even in Rome with Caligula, you know, marrying his horse, seen this type of craziness
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:29.120]  where it's like they're wanting to push us into rebellion.
[1:39:29.120 --> 1:39:35.120]  And exactly. And this is the same thing. I mean, the same thing happened in France, you know.
[1:39:35.120 --> 1:39:41.120]  It's they don't, they are living in a world that you think...
[1:39:41.120 --> 1:39:48.120]  And I was on the MSNBC one time and recently, during the elections, and Mitt Romney was still in the race
[1:39:48.120 --> 1:39:53.120]  and he came out with his shining city on the hill kind of thing, trying to mimic Reagan.
[1:39:53.120 --> 1:39:59.120]  And the host said to me, well, you know, isn't Governor Romney correct? What are you saying?
[1:39:59.120 --> 1:40:01.120]  You know, shouldn't we be more hopeful?
[1:40:01.120 --> 1:40:05.120]  You know, this was, you know, last year and I said, this year actually, but earlier than you.
[1:40:05.120 --> 1:40:10.120]  And I said, you know, I said, this guy doesn't go to the gas station and pump his own gas.
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:16.120]  He doesn't go shopping and stop and shop and watch the prices of cut coupons.
[1:40:16.120 --> 1:40:20.120]  They don't have a clue what's going on. And that's what's going on over here.
[1:40:20.120 --> 1:40:23.120]  Let them eat cake.
[1:40:23.120 --> 1:40:28.120]  Well, studying history, studying trends, how bad is it going to get?
[1:40:28.120 --> 1:40:36.120]  And we were progressing there. We've gotten up to February, moving forward, break down what you see happening.
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:42.120]  So we think the first cracks are going to become very evident in February when the cold winter sets
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:45.120]  and people are going to feel the hardship.
[1:40:45.120 --> 1:40:48.120]  From then on, it's going to go downhill from there.
[1:40:48.120 --> 1:40:52.120]  We're going to see the real estate markets going to bust out completely.
[1:40:52.120 --> 1:40:58.120]  And again, the next big shoot of fall, here they come, is going to be the commercial real estate sector.
[1:40:58.120 --> 1:41:02.120]  And this is what we wrote in the Trends Journal last year before this all happened.
[1:41:02.120 --> 1:41:07.120]  We said the subprime problem was merely the cracks at the bottom of the foundation.
[1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  Matter of fact, you could see that on a clip that I did in December of 2000 and 7.
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:16.120]  But we said, you know, there's stuff about the subprime.
[1:41:16.120 --> 1:41:18.120]  It's quite a lot of these hedge funds.
[1:41:18.120 --> 1:41:25.120]  And how about these leveraged buyout firms like Sabiris and Carlisle Group and Blackstone
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:29.120]  that were buying up multi-billion dollar companies with no money down?
[1:41:29.120 --> 1:41:32.120]  How about all these real estate developers?
[1:41:32.120 --> 1:41:35.120]  Credit default, swaps and credit cards and just everything.
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:38.120]  Exactly. So now you look at the commercial sector.
[1:41:38.120 --> 1:41:44.120]  As I said, you're seeing now after the retail hit comes, you're going to start seeing ghost malls.
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:46.120]  Who's going to occupy these things?
[1:41:46.120 --> 1:41:48.120]  But here's the positive end.
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:50.120]  And I want to make this very clear.
[1:41:50.120 --> 1:41:57.120]  As the giants fall, they're going to leave big gaps left behind.
[1:41:57.120 --> 1:42:01.120]  And that's for the entrepreneurs to move into these slots.
[1:42:01.120 --> 1:42:07.120]  You see, what's happening, Alex, is this is by the way more than just the collapse of the market.
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:11.120]  This is the decline of Empire America.
[1:42:11.120 --> 1:42:15.120]  This whole corporate model is built upon growth and expansion.
[1:42:15.120 --> 1:42:18.120]  Let's take first the retail sector.
[1:42:18.120 --> 1:42:23.120]  They get their money in their stock, people to buy stock in them.
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:26.120]  By the amount of new stores they're building each year, their expansion.
[1:42:26.120 --> 1:42:28.120]  Now they're in decline.
[1:42:28.120 --> 1:42:32.120]  It's not as though these are brilliant managers and increasing in-store sales.
[1:42:32.120 --> 1:42:34.120]  That's not happening.
[1:42:34.120 --> 1:42:37.120]  You're saying we've got to switch to innovation, not just growth and expansion.
[1:42:37.120 --> 1:42:41.120]  Exactly, and they don't know how to do that.
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:45.120]  We were talking earlier why I get frustrated working with large corporations.
[1:42:45.120 --> 1:42:48.120]  The innovation is not part of their DNA.
[1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:50.120]  The rest of it, they wouldn't be them.
[1:42:50.120 --> 1:42:52.120]  All they know how to do is make money.
[1:42:52.120 --> 1:42:55.120]  That doesn't make you smart. It makes you shrewd.
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:42:58.120]  So there are very different things here.
[1:42:58.120 --> 1:43:00.120]  This is going to be a great opportunity.
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:04.120]  Something old and ugly is dying that deserves to die.
[1:43:04.120 --> 1:43:07.120]  Now let's take it to the other level, agriculture.
[1:43:07.120 --> 1:43:13.120]  The agricultural model is built upon producing masses amounts of product
[1:43:13.120 --> 1:43:16.120]  and then shipping it far distances.
[1:43:16.120 --> 1:43:18.120]  Guess what? Can't do that anymore.
[1:43:18.120 --> 1:43:20.120]  This is a great time for local.
[1:43:20.120 --> 1:43:23.120]  Local communities buy local.
[1:43:23.120 --> 1:43:26.120]  If the people want to thrive and survive in these times,
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:28.120]  they have to put their focus locally.
[1:43:28.120 --> 1:43:31.120]  Support everything you can locally.
[1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:34.120]  Don't buy a thing that you don't have to.
[1:43:34.120 --> 1:43:38.120]  And by the way, people ask me, what should I do?
[1:43:38.120 --> 1:43:41.120]  The first thing you do is call up whatever town you're living in
[1:43:41.120 --> 1:43:44.120]  and tell them to shut the damn lights off
[1:43:44.120 --> 1:43:46.120]  then lighting up all these municipal buildings.
[1:43:46.120 --> 1:43:48.120]  It cost money.
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:50.120]  My father, he was seven of us.
[1:43:50.120 --> 1:43:52.120]  They grew up in the Bronx.
[1:43:52.120 --> 1:43:54.120]  They saw rest in peace.
[1:43:54.120 --> 1:43:57.120]  He used to say to us, shut the lights off.
[1:43:57.120 --> 1:43:59.120]  What do you think I have to pull with Edison?
[1:43:59.120 --> 1:44:01.120]  Shut the lights off.
[1:44:01.120 --> 1:44:04.120]  Stop. I don't want to pay for this stupidity.
[1:44:04.120 --> 1:44:06.120]  This is where we're going.
[1:44:06.120 --> 1:44:08.120]  Then we're going to start seeing the tax revolts.
[1:44:08.120 --> 1:44:12.120]  You can't raise taxes when people are out of work
[1:44:12.120 --> 1:44:14.120]  and their incomes are declining.
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:16.120]  Who do these people think they are?
[1:44:16.120 --> 1:44:20.120]  What you said earlier is happening already.
[1:44:20.120 --> 1:44:22.120]  Bush tripled the size of government.
[1:44:22.120 --> 1:44:24.120]  Obama is promising to expand it even more.
[1:44:24.120 --> 1:44:28.120]  They're hiring more cops, more bureaucrats, more and more and more.
[1:44:28.120 --> 1:44:30.120]  They just don't have it.
[1:44:30.120 --> 1:44:32.120]  What is it you don't understand?
[1:44:32.120 --> 1:44:34.120]  Exactly.
[1:44:34.120 --> 1:44:37.120]  Then they're going to understand the same way they did with the French Revolution.
[1:44:37.120 --> 1:44:39.120]  We're going to have a revolution.
[1:44:39.120 --> 1:44:41.120]  By the way, in our future forecast,
[1:44:41.120 --> 1:44:44.120]  we can see the country splitting up into either regions
[1:44:44.120 --> 1:44:46.120]  or separate states pulling out.
[1:44:46.120 --> 1:44:48.120]  Because this country, again,
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:51.120]  you could go back to our Trends Journal.
[1:44:51.120 --> 1:44:55.120]  It was the full edition 2002.
[1:44:55.120 --> 1:44:59.120]  We read Empire America fading fast.
[1:44:59.120 --> 1:45:02.120]  We're going the way of the former Soviet Union.
[1:45:02.120 --> 1:45:04.120]  We're going to see this country break up.
[1:45:04.120 --> 1:45:08.120]  For anybody to think that these people in Washington
[1:45:08.120 --> 1:45:11.120]  are intelligent, more intelligent than they are,
[1:45:11.120 --> 1:45:13.120]  or they have the answers.
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:17.120]  A lot of them are.
[1:45:17.120 --> 1:45:20.120]  People worth billions of dollars that I know that lived in Austin
[1:45:20.120 --> 1:45:21.120]  and I've met personally.
[1:45:21.120 --> 1:45:24.120]  They have fled the country in the last three years.
[1:45:24.120 --> 1:45:26.120]  They're inside info,
[1:45:26.120 --> 1:45:28.120]  and I was saying this three years ago,
[1:45:28.120 --> 1:45:31.120]  the United States quote won't be here economically.
[1:45:31.120 --> 1:45:35.120]  That's the term you're using is a post-industrial,
[1:45:35.120 --> 1:45:37.120]  a post-first world nation.
[1:45:37.120 --> 1:45:40.120]  We call it an underdeveloping nation.
[1:45:40.120 --> 1:45:44.120]  They're going to do the things that they do in other underdeveloping nations,
[1:45:44.120 --> 1:45:46.120]  for example, like in Argentina.
[1:45:46.120 --> 1:45:48.120]  When the currency busts out,
[1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:51.120]  you can't get your money out of the bank.
[1:45:51.120 --> 1:45:54.120]  They'll do a fake flag thing.
[1:45:54.120 --> 1:45:56.120]  They'll blame something else for the problem.
[1:45:56.120 --> 1:45:59.120]  I mean, I love this Obama and his speech.
[1:45:59.120 --> 1:46:02.120]  Yes, we can. We don't count.
[1:46:02.120 --> 1:46:04.120]  If they were listening to the weeds,
[1:46:04.120 --> 1:46:07.120]  the weeds don't want the General Motors bailout,
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:09.120]  and the weeds didn't want the 700 million bailout.
[1:46:09.120 --> 1:46:11.120]  Let's stop right there.
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:13.120]  You talk about a false flag,
[1:46:13.120 --> 1:46:15.120]  some type of staged event,
[1:46:15.120 --> 1:46:17.120]  or a group of staged events to keep the slaves
[1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:20.120]  rallied around the bankers while they slit our throats.
[1:46:20.120 --> 1:46:22.120]  You got it.
[1:46:22.120 --> 1:46:25.120]  Look, I did nothing that they say that I believe.
[1:46:25.120 --> 1:46:27.120]  Read my lips. No new taxes.
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:29.120]  I didn't have sex with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.
[1:46:29.120 --> 1:46:31.120]  I smoked, but I didn't inhale.
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:33.120]  I'm no crook.
[1:46:33.120 --> 1:46:35.120]  You know, there's someone who's saying
[1:46:35.120 --> 1:46:37.120]  has weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[1:46:37.120 --> 1:46:39.120]  What am I, a kid? I'm going to believe these people.
[1:46:39.120 --> 1:46:42.120]  Well, it just came out again that
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:44.120]  every TV station that Congress looked at
[1:46:44.120 --> 1:46:46.120]  is broadcasting fake news.
[1:46:46.120 --> 1:46:48.120]  They were paid to lie.
[1:46:48.120 --> 1:46:50.120]  One example is, every year before school,
[1:46:50.120 --> 1:46:53.120]  you see the same newscast on every channel, same words.
[1:46:53.120 --> 1:46:55.120]  I knew it was paid for them, but now they admit it,
[1:46:55.120 --> 1:46:57.120]  and they say it's a law to take vaccines.
[1:46:57.120 --> 1:46:59.120]  There is no law.
[1:46:59.120 --> 1:47:02.120]  That's how bankrupt and evil and corrupt,
[1:47:02.120 --> 1:47:04.120]  and they aren't going to stop.
[1:47:04.120 --> 1:47:06.120]  I've got so many callers I want to talk to you.
[1:47:06.120 --> 1:47:08.120]  This is such a hot interview.
[1:47:08.120 --> 1:47:10.120]  Is there any way to keep you, and if you can't,
[1:47:10.120 --> 1:47:12.120]  we'll just have you back up in a few weeks,
[1:47:12.120 --> 1:47:14.120]  for 15 minutes until the next hour?
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:16.120]  Sure, I'll do another 15.
[1:47:16.120 --> 1:47:18.120]  You'll be gone at 15 after next hour.
[1:47:18.120 --> 1:47:21.120]  That gives us another 30 minutes or 25 minutes or so,
[1:47:21.120 --> 1:47:24.120]  because I want to go to callers when we come back.
[1:47:24.120 --> 1:47:26.120]  What about pension funds?
[1:47:26.120 --> 1:47:28.120]  You talk about Argentina. You talk about other countries.
[1:47:28.120 --> 1:47:30.120]  They are now saying, hey,
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  we want to take over the pension funds, the 401Ks,
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:35.120]  to, quote, keep them safe.
[1:47:35.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  Your take on that.
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:41.120]  Again, as I said, you could call it communist, fascist,
[1:47:41.120 --> 1:47:45.120]  or socialist, but you can't call it democracy or free market.
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:47.120]  They will do anything.
[1:47:47.120 --> 1:47:52.120]  And so, yeah, I don't put that past them.
[1:47:52.120 --> 1:47:54.120]  Well, Congress just had hearings last week,
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:57.120]  saying they're looking at it, taxing them, taking part of them.
[1:47:57.120 --> 1:47:59.120]  They're going to take your private 401K,
[1:47:59.120 --> 1:48:01.120]  and then the Social Security Administration
[1:48:01.120 --> 1:48:03.120]  is going to send you a check.
[1:48:03.120 --> 1:48:06.120]  I mean, so you're saying you really think
[1:48:06.120 --> 1:48:08.120]  they're delusional in government,
[1:48:08.120 --> 1:48:10.120]  and they just think we're going to go along with this.
[1:48:10.120 --> 1:48:12.120]  Well, yeah, I mean, again, look at who these people are.
[1:48:12.120 --> 1:48:14.120]  I love it that they're saying now that
[1:48:14.120 --> 1:48:16.120]  the Democrats are in power over here,
[1:48:16.120 --> 1:48:18.120]  now that we're able to get something done.
[1:48:18.120 --> 1:48:20.120]  I mean, who's going to get what done?
[1:48:20.120 --> 1:48:22.120]  Pelosi, Reid, Dodd, Frank,
[1:48:22.120 --> 1:48:25.120]  how about Laurel and Hardy and Abbott and Costello?
[1:48:25.120 --> 1:48:27.120]  What are these people that have it done?
[1:48:27.120 --> 1:48:29.120]  Who could get away with this stuff?
[1:48:29.120 --> 1:48:30.120]  Except Steele.
[1:48:30.120 --> 1:48:32.120]  Except Steele.
[1:48:32.120 --> 1:48:33.120]  Why do you say that?
[1:48:33.120 --> 1:48:35.120]  And make bad decisions.
[1:48:35.120 --> 1:48:36.120]  Why?
[1:48:36.120 --> 1:48:38.120]  Who could none of us have been employed
[1:48:38.120 --> 1:48:41.120]  if we screwed up as much as they did?
[1:48:41.120 --> 1:48:44.120]  So, I mean, yesterday Obama,
[1:48:44.120 --> 1:48:46.120]  they broadcast that thing on 60 Minutes
[1:48:46.120 --> 1:48:48.120]  about the economy,
[1:48:48.120 --> 1:48:51.120]  and he said he'll do whatever it takes.
[1:48:51.120 --> 1:48:53.120]  Well, what's whatever?
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:48:57.120]  Well, that means nationalizing industries,
[1:48:57.120 --> 1:48:59.120]  stealing everything the middle class has got.
[1:48:59.120 --> 1:49:01.120]  Folks are going to point the poor,
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:03.120]  uneducated people at the middle class.
[1:49:03.120 --> 1:49:05.120]  They're going to rob the middle class,
[1:49:05.120 --> 1:49:08.120]  and they're planning on all of this.
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:10.120]  We'll talk more about it on the other side
[1:49:10.120 --> 1:49:12.120]  with our amazing guest, Gerald Salenty,
[1:49:12.120 --> 1:49:14.120]  his website's TrendsResearch.com,

[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:47.120]  We'll talk more about it on the other side with our amazing guest, Gerald Salenty,

[1:49:49.120 --> 1:50:17.120]  we'll talk more about it on the other side with our amazing guest, Gerald Salenty,
[1:50:17.120 --> 1:50:43.120]  his website's TrendsResearch.com.
[1:50:43.120 --> 1:50:46.120]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11,
[1:50:46.120 --> 1:50:49.120]  a global awakening is taking place.
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:51.120]  An inside job?
[1:50:51.120 --> 1:50:56.120]  How dare you?
[1:50:56.120 --> 1:50:58.120]  If you know that there's treason going on,
[1:50:58.120 --> 1:51:00.120]  you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[1:51:00.120 --> 1:51:02.120]  All hell is breaking loose on 6th Avenue.
[1:51:02.120 --> 1:51:04.120]  And if the government has not told the truth
[1:51:04.120 --> 1:51:08.120]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of...

[1:51:14.120 --> 1:51:17.120]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.

[1:52:20.120 --> 1:52:25.120]  Okay, we're going to go to Steve Tyler, Mike Casey, Aaron, and others.
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:28.120]  Please have your question ready for myself
[1:52:28.120 --> 1:52:31.120]  or the guest, Gerald Salente,
[1:52:31.120 --> 1:52:35.120]  one of the top trim forecasters in the world.
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:39.120]  But, I mean, that last question, we're here marveling at this.
[1:52:39.120 --> 1:52:44.120]  They have, you know, increased the police force six, seven-fold
[1:52:44.120 --> 1:52:46.120]  the last 15 years.
[1:52:46.120 --> 1:52:49.120]  They have prepared this MIT surveillance grid, the cameras,
[1:52:49.120 --> 1:52:51.120]  the license plate reading systems.
[1:52:51.120 --> 1:52:53.120]  They say they're getting ready for revolts.
[1:52:53.120 --> 1:52:59.120]  They're moving Northcom brigades in saying we're under military occupation.
[1:52:59.120 --> 1:53:02.120]  So, the government at the top does know it's going to be unpopular
[1:53:02.120 --> 1:53:06.120]  and that the raping of the middle class is going to be unpopular,
[1:53:06.120 --> 1:53:09.120]  but they're going to use the poor, dumb-down, you know,
[1:53:09.120 --> 1:53:13.120]  who means well middle class, you know, middle-lower class or whatever
[1:53:13.120 --> 1:53:17.120]  and the blue-collar folks to kind of sick them on the middle class
[1:53:17.120 --> 1:53:18.120]  is what I'm seeing.
[1:53:18.120 --> 1:53:22.120]  I see that class warfare being set up.
[1:53:22.120 --> 1:53:24.120]  What do you see, Gerald Salente?
[1:53:24.120 --> 1:53:26.120]  They're going to try that, but it's not going to work
[1:53:26.120 --> 1:53:29.120]  because, you know, they're going to be very angry
[1:53:29.120 --> 1:53:31.120]  at all levels of society
[1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:33.120]  because there's not going to be any money out there.
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:35.120]  The government's going to become the common enemy.
[1:53:35.120 --> 1:53:38.120]  And as a matter of fact, we see the Republicans and the Democrats
[1:53:38.120 --> 1:53:42.120]  working together very closely, you know, to defeat the common enemy
[1:53:42.120 --> 1:53:44.120]  which is going to be the common man.
[1:53:44.120 --> 1:53:48.120]  And that's what we see the battle shaping up in the coming years.
[1:53:48.120 --> 1:53:52.120]  That's why we see such incredible integration of both parties
[1:53:52.120 --> 1:53:54.120]  because they work for the very same interest.
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:57.120]  Exactly. They both work for the Wall Street mob.
[1:53:57.120 --> 1:53:59.120]  You just have different divisions.
[1:53:59.120 --> 1:54:03.120]  You have the, you know, the Goldman Sachs group over in D.C.
[1:54:03.120 --> 1:54:09.120]  You have the J.P. Morgan mob over in New York.
[1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:12.120]  You know, it's just different, you know, members of the crime family.
[1:54:12.120 --> 1:54:14.120]  You've got Gambino and the Genovese.
[1:54:14.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  So in closing before we go to call, sir, you know, basic trends.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  2009 starts accelerating.
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:25.120]  More and more layoffs, more confidence lost.
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:28.120]  You talk about total implosion by 2012.
[1:54:28.120 --> 1:54:29.120]  What will it look like?
[1:54:29.120 --> 1:54:32.120]  The crime is going to be rampant.
[1:54:32.120 --> 1:54:42.120]  And it's going to be also a time, and I really want to make this
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:44.120]  because there's a positive end to this
[1:54:44.120 --> 1:54:48.120]  because something old and ugly is dying and something new could be born.
[1:54:48.120 --> 1:54:52.120]  This is going to be, this could be the time for a renaissance.
[1:54:52.120 --> 1:54:54.120]  It doesn't have to end ugly.
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:57.120]  Because one thing America has, and I travel the world, I mean,
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:00.120]  you know, people still look to America for the place of innovation.
[1:55:00.120 --> 1:55:02.120]  They don't know how bad it is over here.
[1:55:02.120 --> 1:55:05.120]  You know, they don't know how everybody's become so corporatized.
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:11.120]  But the thing, the thing is that we have more than any other nation,
[1:55:11.120 --> 1:55:16.120]  the ability to turn this around and turn it into a positive.
[1:55:16.120 --> 1:55:24.120]  And the way it becomes a positive is if we break away from one size rules all.
[1:55:24.120 --> 1:55:31.120]  So if we start going back to states' rights, to local rights, and then also Alex,
[1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:34.120]  necessity is the mother of invention.
[1:55:34.120 --> 1:55:36.120]  Great things could happen from this.
[1:55:36.120 --> 1:55:39.120]  No, I agree. We're stagnant. We're decadent. We're dying.
[1:55:39.120 --> 1:55:43.120]  This is like getting a fever that burns out the infection.
[1:55:43.120 --> 1:55:45.120]  But, so that's the big challenge.
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:50.120]  Do we let the globalist, the New World Order, use the crisis to sell total control?
[1:55:50.120 --> 1:55:56.120]  Or do we do a judo move and use this attack against them to fully discredit them
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:58.120]  and have a true renaissance?
[1:55:58.120 --> 1:56:03.120]  Precisely. And that's by the way the foundation of the work at the Trends Research Institute.
[1:56:03.120 --> 1:56:08.120]  We provide the trends. We provide the lifeboats.
[1:56:08.120 --> 1:56:13.120]  But once you get into it, then you have to use your own skills, imagination,
[1:56:13.120 --> 1:56:16.120]  and ingenuity to navigate the open sea.
[1:56:16.120 --> 1:56:19.120]  Yeah, this isn't some master control thing.
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:29.120]  Exactly. So we believe that every human is endowed with a unique individual gift.
[1:56:29.120 --> 1:56:35.120]  And when you're free to bring that out, that's the renaissance.
[1:56:35.120 --> 1:56:37.120]  And that has not happened.
[1:56:37.120 --> 1:56:43.120]  We've become all corporatized, homogenized, and what is this?
[1:56:43.120 --> 1:56:46.120]  This is a McDonald's and a Burger King rule.
[1:56:46.120 --> 1:56:50.120]  Just like Androids, the public has literally taken on a false reality.
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:52.120]  Now that nightmare hopefully is about to end.
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:56.120]  Stay there. Back in 60 seconds with your call.
[1:56:56.120 --> 1:57:01.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[1:57:01.120 --> 1:57:06.120]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[1:57:06.120 --> 1:57:10.120]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history,
[1:57:10.120 --> 1:57:13.120]  a terrorist act of war against this country.
[1:57:13.120 --> 1:57:17.120]  The enemies struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[1:57:17.120 --> 1:57:19.120]  bin Laden. This is his MO.
[1:57:19.120 --> 1:57:22.120]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama bin Laden.
[1:57:22.120 --> 1:57:30.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[1:57:30.120 --> 1:57:36.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis, again, very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[1:57:36.120 --> 1:57:40.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[1:57:40.120 --> 1:57:44.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[1:57:44.120 --> 1:57:47.120]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network,
[1:57:47.120 --> 1:57:52.120]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies.

[1:58:03.120 --> 1:58:05.120]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:58:09.120 --> 1:58:15.120]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:21.120 --> 1:58:27.120]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[1:58:27.120 --> 1:58:33.120]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:58:33.120 --> 1:58:38.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:58:38.120 --> 1:58:47.120]  Go to trendsresearch.com. You can subscribe to his Trends Tracking publication, The Trends Journal.
[1:58:47.120 --> 1:58:51.120]  Again, trendsresearch.com, my website's infowars.com.
[1:58:51.120 --> 1:58:57.120]  Gerald Salente is our guest. We're going to go ahead and go to your phone calls now.
[1:58:57.120 --> 1:59:01.120]  Thank you for holding. Stephen, Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[1:59:01.120 --> 1:59:03.120]  Yes, sir.
[1:59:03.120 --> 1:59:05.120]  Go ahead.
[1:59:05.120 --> 1:59:08.120]  With the trend of big government that we've had in the last eight years,
[1:59:08.120 --> 1:59:11.120]  and which will probably continue under the reign of Obama,
[1:59:11.120 --> 1:59:16.120]  do you see Obama or somebody like him being in office for more than eight years
[1:59:16.120 --> 1:59:21.120]  to repel the constitutional amendment that prevents president being in there for more than two terms?
[1:59:21.120 --> 1:59:26.120]  No, we really don't, because he's going to end up very unpopular.
[1:59:26.120 --> 1:59:29.120]  You know, people are putting more into this than it is.
[1:59:29.120 --> 1:59:32.120]  I mean, let's remember, you've only got 52% of the vote.
[1:59:32.120 --> 1:59:36.120]  What was it when FDR came in? Alex was like 80% the second time around or something.
[1:59:36.120 --> 1:59:40.120]  Absolutely. And height dissipates a lot faster now.
[1:59:40.120 --> 1:59:44.120]  The people aren't very sophisticated in knowing they're being lied to,
[1:59:44.120 --> 1:59:48.120]  and so they want instant gratification.
[1:59:48.120 --> 1:59:54.120]  If Obama doesn't deliver them to Valhalla instantly,
[1:59:54.120 --> 1:59:56.120]  they're going to turn against him. Gerald?
[1:59:56.120 --> 1:59:58.120]  Yes, I agree with you.
[1:59:58.120 --> 2:00:02.120]  Not instantly. We give him at least six months.
[2:00:02.120 --> 2:00:04.120]  I mean, we could be wrong on this.
[2:00:04.120 --> 2:00:12.120]  But again, the people are so desperate that they buy lines from a presidential reality show.
[2:00:12.120 --> 2:00:15.120]  Oh, by the way, I have to make this point.
[2:00:15.120 --> 2:00:19.120]  Obama, this was an Oprah production.
[2:00:19.120 --> 2:00:23.120]  I've been on every major TV show, and I've been on Oprah twice.
[2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:27.120]  Nobody does it like Oprah. She's the queen of TV, hands down.
[2:00:27.120 --> 2:00:33.120]  You go back to December when Oprah started to support Obama.
[2:00:33.120 --> 2:00:38.120]  The whole stage, the whole scenery, the whole performance changed.
[2:00:38.120 --> 2:00:39.120]  Yeah, she took over.
[2:00:39.120 --> 2:00:42.120]  She took over. This was an Oprah production.
[2:00:42.120 --> 2:00:44.120]  You saw it in his nomination speech.
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:49.120]  If you missed it before, and then you saw it in his acceptance speech rather,
[2:00:49.120 --> 2:00:53.120]  and then you saw it after election day, election eve.
[2:00:53.120 --> 2:00:55.120]  You know, this great staging.
[2:00:55.120 --> 2:00:58.120]  Yeah, she wants global power. She's got a church now,
[2:00:58.120 --> 2:01:00.120]  so she can put her money through that,
[2:01:00.120 --> 2:01:04.120]  and I don't want to use the term launder, but, you know, clean it up.
[2:01:04.120 --> 2:01:08.120]  And she's got a 2 million person church. She wants a global religion.
[2:01:08.120 --> 2:01:12.120]  I mean, this girl is, we ain't seen nothing yet, huh?
[2:01:12.120 --> 2:01:14.120]  So that's why I'm saying not to sell it so short,
[2:01:14.120 --> 2:01:17.120]  because this is a country that loves the reality show,
[2:01:17.120 --> 2:01:20.120]  and they certainly love the presidential reality show.
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:23.120]  Well, by instantly, I meant like six months to a year in the scheme.
[2:01:23.120 --> 2:01:26.120]  Yeah, we're probably talking around the same period.
[2:01:26.120 --> 2:01:29.120]  All right, anything else there, Stephen?
[2:01:29.120 --> 2:01:31.120]  Oh, no, thanks. I have a wonderful day.
[2:01:31.120 --> 2:01:35.120]  Thank you. Let's cram Tyler and California in. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:01:35.120 --> 2:01:38.120]  Hey, what's going on? Mr. Jones, Mr. Slent, how are you guys doing?
[2:01:38.120 --> 2:01:39.120]  Fine, go ahead.
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:43.120]  Good. Hey, my question is, I am a reservist.
[2:01:43.120 --> 2:01:49.120]  I am an active reservist. I'm using my GI Bill to get my degree in history,
[2:01:49.120 --> 2:01:53.120]  and my family is a small business owner,
[2:01:53.120 --> 2:01:56.120]  and he's a rental construction equipment business owner,
[2:01:56.120 --> 2:02:00.120]  and according to my dad and other guys in the business field,
[2:02:00.120 --> 2:02:03.120]  that things have, the economy started to slow down.
[2:02:03.120 --> 2:02:05.120]  Nobody's built me anything anymore.
[2:02:05.120 --> 2:02:08.120]  People aren't doing like lawn and garden type things.
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:10.120]  They're not taking care of the yard because they don't have money to.
[2:02:10.120 --> 2:02:12.120]  Yeah, it's dead. They better sell all that equipment now,
[2:02:12.120 --> 2:02:15.120]  even though it's already been depreciated because of the recession.
[2:02:15.120 --> 2:02:19.120]  We're going into depression. They need to get rid of everything now, Gerald.
[2:02:19.120 --> 2:02:23.120]  Absolutely. We're not telling you what to do,
[2:02:23.120 --> 2:02:27.120]  but it's not going to get better. It's only going to get a lot worse.
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:31.120]  When you talk about gardens, during World War II, they had victory gardens,
[2:02:31.120 --> 2:02:34.120]  and we should start thinking in those terms again,
[2:02:34.120 --> 2:02:39.120]  stop ripping up these stupid lawns with grass that you can't eat or smoke,
[2:02:39.120 --> 2:02:44.120]  and put something productive down there, like berry bushes and vegetables.
[2:02:44.120 --> 2:02:47.120]  That's right. 40 years ago, even everybody had a garden in their front yard,
[2:02:47.120 --> 2:02:50.120]  but now the corporate said it wasn't trendy, so you can't do it.
[2:02:50.120 --> 2:02:54.120]  Exactly. So really start thinking in terms of survival.
[2:02:54.120 --> 2:02:58.120]  These are survival times. The winter's coming. Prepare for it.
[2:02:58.120 --> 2:03:04.120]  Again, you know, about getting a degree in history.
[2:03:04.120 --> 2:03:08.120]  We're recommending to people that if you have a kid going to school,
[2:03:08.120 --> 2:03:12.120]  and they're not getting a degree in, let's say, medical field...
[2:03:12.120 --> 2:03:14.120]  Hold on. Give us that advice after the break.
[2:03:14.120 --> 2:03:16.120]  Final segment with our guest.
[2:03:16.120 --> 2:03:18.120]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones.
[2:03:18.120 --> 2:03:21.120]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient,
[2:03:21.120 --> 2:03:23.120]  and today that's more important than ever.
[2:03:23.120 --> 2:03:26.120]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[2:03:26.120 --> 2:03:29.120]  You'll never have to stand in a red line if you have your own bread.
[2:03:29.120 --> 2:03:33.120]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[2:03:33.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare,
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:39.120]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest,
[2:03:39.120 --> 2:03:41.120]  so they ignored your screams not to do it.
[2:03:41.120 --> 2:03:43.120]  They turned off the telephones and emailed.
[2:03:43.120 --> 2:03:47.120]  They voted to print $850 billion, at least, out of thin air.
[2:03:47.120 --> 2:03:50.120]  This money now owns the American and European banks.
[2:03:50.120 --> 2:03:54.120]  The exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing
[2:03:54.120 --> 2:03:58.120]  and last the cost of necessities, particularly food, beyond many Americans' reach.
[2:03:58.120 --> 2:04:03.120]  In pre-Nazi Germany's superinflation, the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[2:04:03.120 --> 2:04:05.120]  until it reached over 4 billion marks.
[2:04:05.120 --> 2:04:10.120]  Food prices are skyrocketing so fast, there seems as if there may be no end in sight.
[2:04:10.120 --> 2:04:12.120]  The private banks, merging with our government,
[2:04:12.120 --> 2:04:15.120]  are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves.
[2:04:15.120 --> 2:04:19.120]  The stores have less food, but jack of prices to stay in business.
[2:04:19.120 --> 2:04:22.120]  Whatever happens in America, we need to be prepared and be ready.
[2:04:22.120 --> 2:04:24.120]  Everything is zeroing in on food.
[2:04:24.120 --> 2:04:28.120]  One third of Americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities.
[2:04:28.120 --> 2:04:32.120]  My friends, whatever it takes, get prepared, get self-sufficient, get food.
[2:04:32.120 --> 2:04:35.120]  For everybody out there listening, it's very important for you to understand
[2:04:35.120 --> 2:04:38.120]  that by having a supply of storable food, the government, the new old order,
[2:04:38.120 --> 2:04:41.120]  has a lot less control over you, and so it's a mindset,
[2:04:41.120 --> 2:04:44.120]  a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness.
[2:04:44.120 --> 2:04:47.120]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[2:04:47.120 --> 2:04:52.120]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli,

[2:17:25.120 --> 2:17:31.120]  What will happen when the grocery stores are empty? What are you going to do once your food is gone?
[2:17:31.120 --> 2:17:36.120]  What will you do when the dollar is worthless and your family needs to eat?
[2:17:36.120 --> 2:17:41.120]  Growing your own food is the only way to have real self-sufficiency and peace of mind.
[2:17:41.120 --> 2:17:56.120]  GetSeeds.net is offering an amazing special on 100 different varieties of heirloom vegetable seeds with a complete range of crops.

[2:18:24.120 --> 2:18:31.120]  Today, unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:18:31.120 --> 2:18:35.120]  The enemies start America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[2:18:35.120 --> 2:18:37.120]  Bin Laden. This is his MO.
[2:18:37.120 --> 2:18:40.120]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:18:40.120 --> 2:18:47.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:18:47.120 --> 2:18:54.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:18:54.120 --> 2:18:58.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:18:58.120 --> 2:19:05.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network,
[2:19:05.120 --> 2:19:17.120]  warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com or see it in super high quality along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:19:17.120 --> 2:19:24.120]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.

[2:19:34.120 --> 2:19:38.120]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[2:21:34.120 --> 2:21:43.120]  Max Kaiser is coming up. I've got a lot of other news. Folks, I've got stacks of articles for the police, the government, the military, the bureaucrats.
[2:21:43.120 --> 2:21:50.120]  They just do whatever they want now. I mean, corruption is just spreading everywhere. The government is insane.
[2:21:50.120 --> 2:21:58.120]  The population is decadent scum. What do we, the people that want liberty and freedom do? We get prepared.
[2:21:58.120 --> 2:22:06.120]  We wake up as many people that care to hear the truth as we can. We don't go to FEMA camps. We don't go to work brigades. They're openly talking about that.
[2:22:06.120 --> 2:22:15.120]  It's in the executive orders. Let me give you all a message. I'm not going to FEMA camps. I'm not working in slave labor. I'm not going to lick your boots.
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:23.120]  You're going to have to put me six feet under. And you know what that means? To do that, you're going to have to go all the way up against me.
[2:22:23.120 --> 2:22:30.120]  And millions of other people. You may catch a few of us in the dark at night at 4 a.m. when you're stealing houses and neighborhoods and everything else.
[2:22:30.120 --> 2:22:35.120]  You're crime bosses. But in the end, you're going to get your butts kicked. So I'd back off now and join the American people.
[2:22:35.120 --> 2:22:43.120]  You know we're in the right. You know the New World Order is real. Your bosses are poisoning you. The New World Order is a bunch of sickos.
[2:22:43.120 --> 2:22:53.120]  It's all by design. I'm not going to spend more than three minutes with my druggy men here because I heard Gerald Salende talking about gold. Folks, this is a buying opportunity.
[2:22:53.120 --> 2:23:03.120]  Gold's back up again today. It's up about 50 bucks in the last week. And all I can say is it is a buying opportunity right now.
[2:23:03.120 --> 2:23:07.120]  Ted Anderson, please tell folks about today's special offer.
[2:23:07.120 --> 2:23:13.120]  You're right. Gold is back and down this morning. It's back up now. Right now we have, I can do the same thing I did last Friday.
[2:23:13.120 --> 2:23:21.120]  Right now I have the Frank currently right now at 187. The British sovereign currently right now at 228.
[2:23:21.120 --> 2:23:29.120]  Both of those are, you know, Frank is 11 bucks off from the last time I had offered him. The British sovereign is off closer to 20.
[2:23:29.120 --> 2:23:39.120]  The, I also have the walking liberties and silver. I mean, silver is really a good buy tool. Let's face it, when it comes down to buying groceries, you're going to need some of that.
[2:23:39.120 --> 2:23:47.120]  By the way, most even big firms are sold out or it's at a 30, 40, 50% premium, even on bullion. And they tell you months.
[2:23:47.120 --> 2:23:56.120]  Ted has this in a bank vault in Minnesota. It ships out every day. He has it on hand, ladies and gentlemen. Ted, tell them.
[2:23:56.120 --> 2:24:02.120]  Yeah. Yeah. You're right about that. And in addition to this, people right now in the futures market are trying to take physical delivery there.
[2:24:02.120 --> 2:24:05.120]  And it's like fractional reserve banking. There's not enough to go around.
[2:24:05.120 --> 2:24:12.120]  So there's now a run on the paper gold because they just manipulated and shorted the market to drive it down. Explain that, Ted.
[2:24:12.120 --> 2:24:16.120]  Well, because it takes a lot of gold to lend in order for you to buy these shorts.
[2:24:16.120 --> 2:24:21.120]  If you're selling something you don't have it to actually sell it, it means you have to borrow it from somebody else.
[2:24:21.120 --> 2:24:28.120]  Usually it comes from the central banks and that's why you're seeing that kind of manipulation and people are coming to that where the banks are selling gold.
[2:24:28.120 --> 2:24:32.120]  That's what they're doing right now. They're trying to sell their own reserves.
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:37.120]  They've been caught using the bailout money too in the shorting.
[2:24:37.120 --> 2:24:48.120]  Yeah. So all this manipulation is going on, but the physical demand market, the stuff that's actually out there, the coin gold, that stuff is trading at premiums anywhere from $100 to $150 over spot.
[2:24:48.120 --> 2:24:58.120]  And so there's this complete arbitrage going on where there's one market is being suppressed and the other one is saying, no, we're up here because they can't manipulate that.
[2:24:58.120 --> 2:25:00.120]  It's about physical supply.
[2:25:00.120 --> 2:25:06.120]  Ted, give them your whole portfolio. I mean, I know you've got a lot of other stuff, but some of it are collectors and have a bigger premium.
[2:25:06.120 --> 2:25:13.120]  We got $10 Indians right now. They're at $673. I've got the $10 Liberties. They're at $653. That's a good buy.
[2:25:13.120 --> 2:25:20.120]  I have the confiscation proof $5 commemorative pieces that the U.S. Mint put out as collector coins.
[2:25:20.120 --> 2:25:28.120]  You've got great deals on all those, but the very best for just a collector coin at a billion prices, even below, because you bought it when gold was down.
[2:25:28.120 --> 2:25:31.120]  You've got Franks. You've got sovereigns.
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:37.120]  We have US e-goals. We have Canadian Maple Leafs. We have...
[2:25:37.120 --> 2:25:39.120]  Wait a minute. You have Canadian Maple Leafs?
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:43.120]  We have some Canadian Maple Leafs, a very short supply in that stuff.
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:46.120]  I'll be lucky to do 50 of them. I mean, that's...
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:47.120]  Oh, really? How much are those?
[2:25:47.120 --> 2:25:52.120]  Well, they're currently trading right now in the range of just under $900 each.
[2:25:52.120 --> 2:25:55.120]  Okay, regardless, folks, 900 bucks.
[2:25:55.120 --> 2:25:56.120]  Yeah, just under that.
[2:25:56.120 --> 2:26:02.120]  That is an insane deal. That coin's got huge premiums. I'll see those things for $1,200 right now.
[2:26:02.120 --> 2:26:09.120]  Oh, I know it, but... Okay, well, here's the number. 800-686-2237-800-686-2237.
[2:26:09.120 --> 2:26:14.120]  And last week, I told Ted, I was going to buy some end-aims. I got so busy, I didn't even do it.
[2:26:14.120 --> 2:26:17.120]  This happens to all of us, folks. Do not procrastinate.
[2:26:17.120 --> 2:26:23.120]  800-686-2237. Tell them Alex Jones and Ted Anderson sent you. Tell them it's the radio special.
[2:26:23.120 --> 2:26:30.120]  Or you will be paying more for Maple Leafs and more for American e-goals and more for the Franks and more for the sovereigns.
[2:26:30.120 --> 2:26:38.120]  This is the radio special. Okay, you have to tell them that. 800-686-2237 real fast.
[2:26:38.120 --> 2:26:40.120]  Tell them the prices so folks can quote them.
[2:26:40.120 --> 2:26:45.120]  Well, right now, what you're going to ask for is going to add the Frank right now is at $187.
[2:26:45.120 --> 2:26:51.120]  The sovereign right now is at $228. The $10 Indian, $673. That is a fabulous coin.
[2:26:51.120 --> 2:26:55.120]  And then, of course, the Walking Liberty, half 840. And I think that's about all I have time for.
[2:26:55.120 --> 2:26:57.120]  There's more. Just calling it.
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:26:59.120]  And people will be there until midnight tonight.

[2:28:23.120 --> 2:28:31.120]  On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to ground here and we knew what to do.
[2:28:31.120 --> 2:28:33.120]  Or at least we thought we did.
[2:28:33.120 --> 2:28:40.120]  Truth Rising is a breakthrough 9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story.
[2:28:40.120 --> 2:28:49.120]  Whitman, EVA director on the 18th made a statement that the air was safe to breathe.
[2:28:49.120 --> 2:28:56.120]  This film follows the growing momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[2:28:56.120 --> 2:28:59.120]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown.
[2:28:59.120 --> 2:29:05.120]  He takes his hand off and you hear three, two, one, and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[2:29:05.120 --> 2:29:12.120]  This is an emergency transmission worldwide. Download Truth Rising at prisonplanet.tv
[2:29:12.120 --> 2:29:17.120]  and aggressively spread it worldwide or order the DVD at infowars.com.
[2:29:17.120 --> 2:29:23.120]  If we don't expose the government sponsored terror, they're going to commit more acts and bring in martial law.
[2:29:23.120 --> 2:29:27.120]  Fuel prices are up and down, fighting into everyone's budget.
[2:29:27.120 --> 2:29:31.120]  If you're ready to start saving at the pump, fuel saver technologies can help.
[2:29:31.120 --> 2:29:36.120]  With a small squeeze of our fuel conditioner in your gas tank, more of each gallon of fuel will combust,
[2:29:36.120 --> 2:29:39.120]  improving your fuel economy 10-20% or more.

[2:30:19.120 --> 2:30:22.120]  Let it all hang out cause we got a run to make.
[2:30:22.120 --> 2:30:27.120]  The boys up there sticking Atlanta and there's beer and Texarkana,
[2:30:27.120 --> 2:30:31.120]  and we'll bring it back no matter what it takes.
[2:30:31.120 --> 2:30:35.120]  He's found it down, put it up and trucking.
[2:30:35.120 --> 2:30:38.120]  Are we going to do what they say can't be done?
[2:30:38.120 --> 2:30:43.120]  We've got a long way to go and it's short time to get there.
[2:30:43.120 --> 2:30:53.120]  For the next 50 minutes or so, we're going to open the phones up and let you talk to Max Kaiser.
[2:30:53.120 --> 2:30:57.120]  He does international television for, well, you name it.
[2:30:57.120 --> 2:31:02.120]  He's invented major systems used on stock markets worldwide.
[2:31:02.120 --> 2:31:08.120]  He's producing an international TV show for the BBC with Alec Baldwin.
[2:31:08.120 --> 2:31:15.120]  Check out his website MaxKaiser.com because the guy is doing too much to ever tell you about it all.
[2:31:15.120 --> 2:31:24.120]  But before we go to him, I want to tell you about some fabulous sponsors that make this radio show possible.
[2:31:24.120 --> 2:31:28.120]  This is where I get my storeable food and the craziest things are.
[2:31:28.120 --> 2:31:31.120]  You better believe I got an attic absolutely full of it.
[2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:35.120]  Three year plus supply for my wife and my children and me.
[2:31:35.120 --> 2:31:42.120]  If I don't use it in 10, 15 years, I can throw it out or I can give it to charity, which I'll do before it gets bad.
[2:31:42.120 --> 2:31:45.120]  And then I feel good and I got firearms too.
[2:31:45.120 --> 2:31:52.120]  I'm not a slave and I don't trust the government to take care of me if we have a great depression.
[2:31:52.120 --> 2:31:59.120]  So give the great folks at E-Foods Direct a call, 800-409-5633 at a free brochure or a free audio CD

[2:32:47.120 --> 2:32:49.120]  The water is so good, it will blow your mind.
[2:32:49.120 --> 2:32:54.120]  It grabs it out of the atmosphere, it does southern half gallons and your average humidity.
[2:32:54.120 --> 2:33:00.120]  It'll do more than that in really tropic areas and about half of that in desert, three gallons a day.

[2:33:25.120 --> 2:33:28.120]  Then it goes through five filters inside of it.
[2:33:28.120 --> 2:33:32.120]  Check it out at a cola blue.com or 866-585-4044.
[2:33:32.120 --> 2:33:35.120]  All right, going to Max Kaiser.
[2:33:35.120 --> 2:33:37.120]  Max, a lot is happening.
[2:33:37.120 --> 2:33:39.120]  The economy is worsening very quickly.
[2:33:39.120 --> 2:33:47.120]  Gerald Salente on last hour and he's talking about war in the streets within two to three years
[2:33:47.120 --> 2:33:50.120]  and it will have bank runs in February.
[2:33:50.120 --> 2:33:52.120]  What do you say to that?
[2:33:52.120 --> 2:33:56.120]  Well, Alex, I think if you look around the world, you're already seeing evidence of that.
[2:33:56.120 --> 2:33:58.120]  And I'll give you two examples.
[2:33:58.120 --> 2:34:03.120]  It was reported today in the independent newspaper in the United Kingdom that gangs from the city
[2:34:03.120 --> 2:34:08.120]  are invading the country and they're stealing livestock from people's farms.
[2:34:08.120 --> 2:34:12.120]  They're stealing salmon and farmed fish from farm fisheries.
[2:34:12.120 --> 2:34:16.120]  And you've already got this happening in the state right now.
[2:34:16.120 --> 2:34:20.120]  People are gang from the city are invading the country and stealing food.
[2:34:20.120 --> 2:34:27.120]  If you look at the global picture, you see that around the world,
[2:34:27.120 --> 2:34:31.120]  the corporations have taken over all the fishing rights around the world.
[2:34:31.120 --> 2:34:35.120]  So in Somali, you've got Somali pirates who are starving to death.
[2:34:35.120 --> 2:34:41.120]  They are hijacking at one ship every day, on average, just for food.
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:45.120]  And they just grabbed a huge oil tanker today so their targets are getting bigger.
[2:34:45.120 --> 2:34:50.120]  Exactly. And they're being tracked by the U.S. and the U.K. or the Navy out there.
[2:34:50.120 --> 2:34:57.120]  But these are people who are starving to death because all of their food supplies have been taken from them by the huge corporations.
[2:34:57.120 --> 2:35:00.120]  So this is what's happening on the fringe of the...
[2:35:00.120 --> 2:35:09.120]  If you're in the United States and your view is that these other areas are on the periphery of the biggest economy in the world,
[2:35:09.120 --> 2:35:15.120]  so-called the U.S., you can see trends developing on the fringe, on the periphery,
[2:35:15.120 --> 2:35:18.120]  and I think they're heading toward the U.S.
[2:35:18.120 --> 2:35:23.120]  But you see it already right now happening around the world.
[2:35:23.120 --> 2:35:28.120]  Max, again, for folks that don't know who you are currently,
[2:35:28.120 --> 2:35:32.120]  I mean, tell us a little bit about yourself and then currently what you're most focused on
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:39.120]  and what you think is most important in the world right now and then trends that you see going into the midterm and long term.
[2:35:39.120 --> 2:35:42.120]  How bad do you think it's really going to get?
[2:35:42.120 --> 2:35:46.120]  Well, just to follow up on a couple of things from when we spoke last time.
[2:35:46.120 --> 2:35:48.120]  We were talking about the gold market.
[2:35:48.120 --> 2:35:52.120]  We were talking about COMEX and the fact that COMEX is short gold that they can't deliver
[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:56.120]  and that some people are out there trying to organize a raid on the COMEX.
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:36:01.120]  I was talking to some folks in Canada, apparently Eric Sprott of Sprott Asset Management
[2:36:01.120 --> 2:36:08.120]  is going to try to take physical delivery of a huge precious metal position on the COMEX this December
[2:36:08.120 --> 2:36:15.120]  to try to force the price from the physical and the paper market to match up.
[2:36:15.120 --> 2:36:17.120]  So that could be, that's still in play.
[2:36:17.120 --> 2:36:21.120]  You know, last time I was mentioning that there could be a major event on the COMEX.
[2:36:21.120 --> 2:36:27.120]  Yes, you did say that, but flush that out a bit for folks that don't know what shorting is and don't know what the COMEX is.
[2:36:27.120 --> 2:36:28.120]  Explain.
[2:36:28.120 --> 2:36:33.120]  Okay, well, shorting is actually something that's come up with a couple of the big stories today
[2:36:33.120 --> 2:36:36.120]  and it relates directly to Goldman Sachs as well.
[2:36:36.120 --> 2:36:38.120]  So I'll segue into the Goldman Sachs thing.
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:44.120]  But a little bit about shorting, it's one of those concepts that people have trouble wrapping their mind around.
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:46.120]  It's a little counterintuitive.
[2:36:46.120 --> 2:36:53.120]  But if I can break it down as simply, people are familiar with the idea of borrowing money to buy a stock
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:58.120]  and if the stock goes up, they sell it for a profit and they pay back their loan.
[2:36:58.120 --> 2:37:04.120]  When you're selling short stock, you're borrowing stock and you're selling that stock
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:08.120]  and you're hoping that the price goes down and after the price goes down,
[2:37:08.120 --> 2:37:15.120]  you buy back your stock at the lower price and you return it to where you borrowed it from.
[2:37:15.120 --> 2:37:20.120]  But because the stock is now at a lower price, the amount of money it took to buy it back is less,
[2:37:20.120 --> 2:37:21.120]  you get to keep the difference.
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:23.120]  That's how you make money out of short sale.
[2:37:23.120 --> 2:37:27.120]  And it works on stocks and it works on commodities and it works on the COMEX.
[2:37:27.120 --> 2:37:32.120]  And the COMEX is where all the biggest precious metal futures operation in the world
[2:37:32.120 --> 2:37:36.120]  and as has been pointed out by numerous guests on your show,
[2:37:36.120 --> 2:37:39.120]  the big bankers in the world who love the idea of fractional reserve banking
[2:37:39.120 --> 2:37:44.120]  and love the idea of infinite credit, they hate gold, they hate precious metals
[2:37:44.120 --> 2:37:48.120]  because it's a limited supply and they don't like to live in a world of limits.
[2:37:48.120 --> 2:37:50.120]  They like to live in a world of infinite credit.
[2:37:50.120 --> 2:37:53.120]  So it's in their interest to try to keep those precious metals down
[2:37:53.120 --> 2:37:58.120]  and they do this primarily by selling gold and silver short.
[2:37:58.120 --> 2:38:03.120]  They're selling gold and silver contracts that they do not own and they borrow for the most part
[2:38:03.120 --> 2:38:06.120]  and they do this with broad money and they can borrow money quite cheaply.
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:11.120]  The scandal here is something called naked short selling
[2:38:11.120 --> 2:38:14.120]  and naked short selling applies both to the COMEX in my opinion
[2:38:14.120 --> 2:38:19.120]  and to what Goldman Sachs has been doing, which is the opinion now of Bloomberg
[2:38:19.120 --> 2:38:25.120]  and the Wall Street Journal and observers around the world.
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:27.120]  Well, there's no doubt they've been doing it.
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:30.120]  They've been doing it to stocks. They recommend to people.
[2:38:30.120 --> 2:38:34.120]  Right. So naked short selling is nothing more than counterfeiting.
[2:38:34.120 --> 2:38:36.120]  It's just straight out counterfeiting.
[2:38:36.120 --> 2:38:40.120]  And this is now, when you listen to your show, of course, Alex, I'm a big fan.
[2:38:40.120 --> 2:38:45.120]  And when you talk about the Illuminati and the globalists and the New World Order,
[2:38:45.120 --> 2:38:50.120]  you can condense all those terms into basically two words, Goldman Sachs.
[2:38:50.120 --> 2:38:55.120]  Goldman Sachs is the epicenter of the entire global banking field.
[2:38:55.120 --> 2:39:01.120]  By the way, you're not joking. They even had a big global advisor on CNBC a few weeks ago
[2:39:01.120 --> 2:39:04.120]  and he said the Illuminati is doing this.
[2:39:04.120 --> 2:39:07.120]  So now we're starting to see that even come out, but go ahead.
[2:39:07.120 --> 2:39:15.120]  Right. I mean, there's no need to look beyond Goldman Sachs, is my point.
[2:39:15.120 --> 2:39:21.120]  You've got now Senator, in a way, or in a way, saying that Goldman Sachs,
[2:39:21.120 --> 2:39:28.120]  he's accusing Goldman Sachs openly that they're giving money from the bailout money to their friends.
[2:39:28.120 --> 2:39:31.120]  They want an investigation. You've got Bernie Sanders in Vermont
[2:39:31.120 --> 2:39:35.120]  who thinks that Goldman Sachs is a conflict of interest. He wants an investigation.
[2:39:35.120 --> 2:39:38.120]  That's the AP headline. I'll just interrupt and back you up.
[2:39:38.120 --> 2:39:43.120]  It's that a Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, very powerful Republican Senator,
[2:39:43.120 --> 2:39:46.120]  is saying that they're giving it to their friends and others.
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:51.120]  And it's not even being denied that that's going on. It's also being used for bonuses.
[2:39:51.120 --> 2:39:52.120]  Go ahead.
[2:39:52.120 --> 2:39:56.120]  Yeah. Chuck Grassley is a senior GOP on the Center for Finance Committee.
[2:39:56.120 --> 2:39:59.120]  You just came out today within the last two hours.
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:01.120]  And it suggests that Goldman Sachs is double dealing.
[2:40:01.120 --> 2:40:03.120]  Goldman Sachs is a conflict of interest.
[2:40:03.120 --> 2:40:06.120]  Goldman Sachs is involved in naked short selling.
[2:40:06.120 --> 2:40:11.120]  Goldman Sachs is at the heart of the American economic and banking collapse.
[2:40:11.120 --> 2:40:14.120]  Is that why they're keeping, I mean, it was Goldman Sachs guys in the 90s
[2:40:14.120 --> 2:40:17.120]  that changed all the rules and in the 2000s with Bush.
[2:40:17.120 --> 2:40:20.120]  And now you notice it's an inner group of Goldman Sachs
[2:40:20.120 --> 2:40:23.120]  running the bailout, running Treasury, running the Fed,
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:27.120]  and that they're bringing more Goldman Sachs people now into it as well.
[2:40:27.120 --> 2:40:31.120]  Is that to keep the conspiracy in a closed circle?
[2:40:31.120 --> 2:40:35.120]  Absolutely. As part of the bailout package, they slipped into the package
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  a tax break to give the bankers $140, $150 billion tax break.
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:44.120]  Okay, so now it's openly being discussed that they're stealing it.
[2:40:44.120 --> 2:40:48.120]  And Goldman Sachs just laughs. Why are they so arrogant?
[2:40:48.120 --> 2:40:51.120]  Because there's been a coup d'etat.
[2:40:51.120 --> 2:40:53.120]  There's been a coup d'etat.
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:56.120]  And Frank Paulson has dictatorial powers.
[2:40:56.120 --> 2:40:58.120]  When I was on your show last time, I believe it was,
[2:40:58.120 --> 2:41:01.120]  I was on your show last time, or I might have been on another network.
[2:41:01.120 --> 2:41:03.120]  No, no, you were here. You were here.
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:08.120]  And I was saying that basically they have achieved through this $700 billion,
[2:41:08.120 --> 2:41:10.120]  which became $850 billion bailout.
[2:41:10.120 --> 2:41:13.120]  It didn't matter what the number was. The number was arbitrary.
[2:41:13.120 --> 2:41:16.120]  The key concept was it gives them dictatorial powers.
[2:41:16.120 --> 2:41:18.120]  That's the key. That is the key.
[2:41:18.120 --> 2:41:23.120]  They have dictatorial powers, and they are literally have ensconced themselves
[2:41:23.120 --> 2:41:28.120]  in a fortress over in Washington with the Washington Wall Street connection.
[2:41:28.120 --> 2:41:30.120]  But just because they say they're God,
[2:41:30.120 --> 2:41:33.120]  and just because they say they can barbeque children on their front porch,
[2:41:33.120 --> 2:41:35.120]  doesn't mean they can.
[2:41:35.120 --> 2:41:37.120]  They had laws saying black people weren't human in this country,
[2:41:37.120 --> 2:41:39.120]  and we know those were bold. They were overthrown.
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:42.120]  So what do we do about these arrogant criminals,
[2:41:42.120 --> 2:41:44.120]  you know, Wall Street frat guys?
[2:41:44.120 --> 2:41:48.120]  I'm not bashing Yalees and people, but that's, I mean, it's that arrogant,
[2:41:48.120 --> 2:41:52.120]  I mean, watching Kash Kari with the smart mouth comments,
[2:41:52.120 --> 2:41:54.120]  you know, the glare last week.
[2:41:54.120 --> 2:41:57.120]  I mean, these are some arrogant little bastards.
[2:41:57.120 --> 2:42:00.120]  Well, I mean, I was on Al Jazeera yesterday morning.
[2:42:00.120 --> 2:42:02.120]  I sent you the clip.
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:04.120]  Yeah, we're going to play it.
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:07.120]  And, you know, I used some language that I don't know much
[2:42:07.120 --> 2:42:11.120]  or Americans have heard in this context.
[2:42:11.120 --> 2:42:18.120]  But, you know, the point is that these guys have,
[2:42:18.120 --> 2:42:21.120]  as you point out, I mean, they are literally,
[2:42:21.120 --> 2:42:25.120]  they pull down their pants and are literally giving a golden shower
[2:42:25.120 --> 2:42:29.120]  into the face of 300 million Americans.
[2:42:29.120 --> 2:42:31.120]  And unless you are into golden showers,
[2:42:31.120 --> 2:42:35.120]  unless you are into S&M, unless you enjoy that kind of thing,
[2:42:35.120 --> 2:42:39.120]  I would suggest that you begin to, or, you know, take some steps.
[2:42:39.120 --> 2:42:42.120]  I mean, this is, this is so, I mean, I've been a,
[2:42:42.120 --> 2:42:45.120]  I've been a observer for markets for 25 years,
[2:42:45.120 --> 2:42:50.120]  and I have seen examples of egregious,
[2:42:50.120 --> 2:42:54.120]  you know, electronic feeding, as we used to do.
[2:42:54.120 --> 2:42:57.120]  I used to do, I mean, I was working on Wall Street in the 1980s.
[2:42:57.120 --> 2:43:01.120]  I know many, many of the tricks that one can use in the bank
[2:43:01.120 --> 2:43:04.120]  to transfer wealth, electronic pickpocketing, we used to call it.
[2:43:04.120 --> 2:43:08.120]  It's just electronically transferring wealth from the customers to the bankers.
[2:43:08.120 --> 2:43:11.120]  That's all pretty much the job entails.
[2:43:11.120 --> 2:43:13.120]  The techniques are pretty standard.
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:15.120]  And the beautiful thing about it, Alex,
[2:43:15.120 --> 2:43:18.120]  if you ever worked on Wall Street is that typically when the,
[2:43:18.120 --> 2:43:20.120]  you know, the management comes around and says,
[2:43:20.120 --> 2:43:23.120]  unless you're being sued, you're not really doing your job.
[2:43:23.120 --> 2:43:25.120]  We've got plenty of lawyers.
[2:43:25.120 --> 2:43:27.120]  Just keep racking up the commissions.
[2:43:27.120 --> 2:43:29.120]  We've got lawyers, just keep racking up the commissions.
[2:43:29.120 --> 2:43:31.120]  And the beautiful thing about it is that,
[2:43:31.120 --> 2:43:35.120]  if in fact it ever gets to the point where there's a serious problem,
[2:43:35.120 --> 2:43:36.120]  two things.
[2:43:36.120 --> 2:43:38.120]  Number one, when you sign a new customer account,
[2:43:38.120 --> 2:43:40.120]  it forces you to go to arbitration.
[2:43:40.120 --> 2:43:43.120]  Well, the people that steal and cheat and make the most money,
[2:43:43.120 --> 2:43:44.120]  they get promoted.
[2:43:44.120 --> 2:43:47.120]  They go, wow, you've been indicted as soon as our lawyers fix this,
[2:43:47.120 --> 2:43:49.120]  you're going to be going up to vice president.
[2:43:49.120 --> 2:43:51.120]  It shows initiative.
[2:43:51.120 --> 2:43:55.120]  It shows initiative, or they simply change the laws.
[2:43:55.120 --> 2:43:57.120]  You see, they simply change the law.
[2:43:57.120 --> 2:44:01.120]  The SEC is overworked and understaffed on purpose.
[2:44:01.120 --> 2:44:04.120]  If there's ever get to things that are really tight, you know,
[2:44:04.120 --> 2:44:05.120]  if you can.
[2:44:05.120 --> 2:44:07.120]  Well, I mean, here's an example under Bush,
[2:44:07.120 --> 2:44:09.120]  and this is all over the news.
[2:44:09.120 --> 2:44:14.120]  Over 90% of the corporate white collar crime investigators were pulled off,
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:16.120]  and they weren't put on anti-terror.
[2:44:16.120 --> 2:44:18.120]  They were put on mom and pops.
[2:44:18.120 --> 2:44:22.120]  So what happens is big, too large to fail groups can steal, kill.
[2:44:22.120 --> 2:44:24.120]  Halliburton can run white slavery camps.
[2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:26.120]  It can be in mainstream news.
[2:44:26.120 --> 2:44:30.120]  Nothing happens to them, but then a pet store owner,
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:33.120]  a guy that owns a used car lot, a dentist,
[2:44:33.120 --> 2:44:35.120]  somebody who has a hamburger place,
[2:44:35.120 --> 2:44:38.120]  the IRS will rake them over the coals for no reason.
[2:44:38.120 --> 2:44:40.120]  Go ahead.
[2:44:40.120 --> 2:44:46.120]  Yeah, and, you know, they just changed the laws, basically, to suit what the...
[2:44:46.120 --> 2:44:48.120]  It's for their convenience.
[2:44:48.120 --> 2:44:52.120]  Bankers are routinely constantly changing the laws, changing the products.
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:55.120]  You know, it's like a three-part, a three-card Monty game in the city.
[2:44:55.120 --> 2:44:58.120]  You know, you see these guys, they're playing three-card Monty,
[2:44:58.120 --> 2:44:59.120]  and the cops show up.
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:01.120]  They can fold up in five seconds, and five minutes later,
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:03.120]  they shut up across the street.
[2:45:03.120 --> 2:45:05.120]  So if they just go from scam to scam to scam,
[2:45:05.120 --> 2:45:09.120]  it's basically the same scam, but repeated in different ways.
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:10.120]  Where is this going?
[2:45:10.120 --> 2:45:13.120]  I mean, the whole culture is going into total corruption.
[2:45:13.120 --> 2:45:16.120]  They're governments expanding, governments feeding.
[2:45:16.120 --> 2:45:18.120]  You know, no different from administration to administration.
[2:45:18.120 --> 2:45:23.120]  How bad is it going to get when the immovable object meets the unstoppable force?
[2:45:23.120 --> 2:45:24.120]  What is going to happen?
[2:45:24.120 --> 2:45:29.120]  A lot of trends, projectors, a lot of experts who've been right in the past are saying,
[2:45:29.120 --> 2:45:31.120]  it's going to end up war on the streets.
[2:45:31.120 --> 2:45:35.120]  Well, there's also another thing going on,
[2:45:35.120 --> 2:45:38.120]  which is I call the sixes versus the nines.
[2:45:38.120 --> 2:45:41.120]  This is the people with six zeros in their net worth, the millionaires,
[2:45:41.120 --> 2:45:45.120]  versus people with nine zeros in their net worth, the billionaires.
[2:45:45.120 --> 2:45:49.120]  Because after 9-11, when they dropped interest rates down to 1%,
[2:45:49.120 --> 2:45:54.120]  they screwed up the economy so badly that now, seven, eight years later,
[2:45:54.120 --> 2:45:58.120]  the system is so badly screwed up that you've got wars broken out
[2:45:58.120 --> 2:46:00.120]  between the billionaires and the millionaires.
[2:46:00.120 --> 2:46:03.120]  So even the millionaires, like five, 10, 15 million dollars,
[2:46:03.120 --> 2:46:06.120]  people who thought they were wealthy a couple of years ago,
[2:46:06.120 --> 2:46:09.120]  are getting squeezed due to the global credit collapse.
[2:46:09.120 --> 2:46:12.120]  So you're seeing, like, for example, Goldman Sachs is going into that war
[2:46:12.120 --> 2:46:14.120]  with its own customers.
[2:46:14.120 --> 2:46:15.120]  And this was today in today's Bloomberg.
[2:46:15.120 --> 2:46:16.120]  Here's an example of this.
[2:46:16.120 --> 2:46:21.120]  Goldman was targeted by investor complaints of naked short selling, Bloomberg.
[2:46:21.120 --> 2:46:26.120]  Investors in a $591 billion high-yield, high-risk loan market are accusing Goldman
[2:46:26.120 --> 2:46:29.120]  of naked short selling to profit from record price declines.
[2:46:29.120 --> 2:46:34.120]  At least two fund managers complained that they were victimized by Goldman,
[2:46:34.120 --> 2:46:36.120]  for whom they were doing business with.
[2:46:36.120 --> 2:46:39.120]  So they've got wars broken out between the millionaires and the billionaires.
[2:46:39.120 --> 2:46:43.120]  And they're using these credit derivative products and other...
[2:46:43.120 --> 2:46:45.120]  So this is only going to get worse.
[2:46:45.120 --> 2:46:47.120]  And then also here, blue collar folks say, I don't care.
[2:46:47.120 --> 2:46:48.120]  I don't own stock.
[2:46:48.120 --> 2:46:50.120]  I don't care about some millionaire.
[2:46:50.120 --> 2:46:51.120]  Well, you better.
[2:46:51.120 --> 2:46:53.120]  They're the ones that buy the products at your shops.
[2:46:53.120 --> 2:46:56.120]  They're the ones that spend money in the economy, not the billionaires.
[2:46:56.120 --> 2:46:57.120]  They all hoard it on average.
[2:46:57.120 --> 2:47:01.120]  It's the millionaires that actually are funding the general public.
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:05.120]  And so what happens when the IRS is going to scalp the millionaires?
[2:47:05.120 --> 2:47:06.120]  What's going to happen?
[2:47:06.120 --> 2:47:12.120]  Well, the problem is that the global credit system is so bad screwed.
[2:47:12.120 --> 2:47:17.120]  You look at what's called the Baltic Dry Index, which is tracks the global shipping industry.
[2:47:17.120 --> 2:47:23.120]  Four months ago, it cost something like $150,000 to send a ship from China to America.
[2:47:23.120 --> 2:47:25.120]  The price has dropped down to $4,000.
[2:47:25.120 --> 2:47:27.120]  It's down to something like 98.5%.
[2:47:27.120 --> 2:47:34.120]  There's literally stockpiles of grains stacked up in the port because all global shipping has come to a halt
[2:47:34.120 --> 2:47:37.120]  because no one can get a letter of credit to send a ship from point A to point B.
[2:47:37.120 --> 2:47:38.120]  Exactly.
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:44.120]  And Ford and GM can't get letters for the insurance for the parts manufacturers,
[2:47:44.120 --> 2:47:49.120]  the insurance on the subcontractors and sell them the parts so they're coming to an end.
[2:47:49.120 --> 2:47:52.120]  Max Kaiser, let's talk about it when we get back.
[2:47:52.120 --> 2:47:56.120]  If I had something to spray on my license plate that would block off the camera,
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:47:58.120]  you bet your father bring it out.
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:00.120]  KETV News Watch 7.
[2:48:00.120 --> 2:48:05.120]  It will render a license plate unreadable to the red light cameras.
[2:48:05.120 --> 2:48:06.120]  We are under the microscope.
[2:48:06.120 --> 2:48:10.120]  Red light cameras and speed cameras are in place to make money, not for your safety.
[2:48:10.120 --> 2:48:13.120]  But you don't have to be defenseless against these unconstitutional devices.

[2:48:52.120 --> 2:48:59.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[2:48:59.120 --> 2:49:01.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:49:01.120 --> 2:49:03.120]  But who is the enemy?
[2:49:03.120 --> 2:49:04.120]  Bin Laden.
[2:49:04.120 --> 2:49:05.120]  This is his MO.
[2:49:05.120 --> 2:49:06.120]  We have to look to the Middle East.
[2:49:06.120 --> 2:49:08.120]  We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[2:49:08.120 --> 2:49:15.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[2:49:15.120 --> 2:49:22.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[2:49:22.120 --> 2:49:26.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[2:49:26.120 --> 2:49:31.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[2:49:31.120 --> 2:49:36.120]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government, and much, much more.
[2:49:36.120 --> 2:49:37.120]  Fabled Enemies.
[2:49:37.120 --> 2:49:45.120]  Get the DVD at infowars.com, foresee it in super high quality, along with hundreds of other titles at prisonplanet.tv.
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:50:11.120]  Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists.
[2:50:15.120 --> 2:50:44.120]  Hey, I want you to play the Illuminati clip first.
[2:50:44.120 --> 2:51:07.120]  Let's go ahead and play that CNBC clip with one of the big wigs on TV saying it's the Illuminati. Here it is.
[2:51:07.120 --> 2:51:15.120]  At least you're getting back to the point where you can start to look at fundamentals, and that's good news. What happened?
[2:51:15.120 --> 2:51:19.120]  I think you're in a liquidation phase. I think Kirsten had it exactly right.
[2:51:19.120 --> 2:51:27.120]  I think there's a bunch of wrong-footed moves by Hank Paulson and the Illuminati of the country, if you will, and I think we're paying for it right now.
[2:51:27.120 --> 2:51:39.120]  Max Kaiser, we've always, for the last 100 years at least, had a very corrupt Wall Street elite that is engaged in some crime, and some skimming, and some manipulation, but it was more boss-hog-like.
[2:51:39.120 --> 2:51:45.120]  This is so virulent. This is so out in the open. They're blowing their whole game.
[2:51:45.120 --> 2:51:52.120]  Is it because the elite knows the dollar's dead and they're bringing us into a new world monetary system that they're just going for broke?
[2:51:52.120 --> 2:51:58.120]  I mean, why? I've never seen, and I've studied a lot of history, some of you, such open arrogance.
[2:51:58.120 --> 2:52:14.120]  I mean, that level of hutzpah or arrogance of bravado kind of shakes me up because, I mean, if they'll steal 5 trillion bucks in a month right in front of you and laugh at you, what are they planning next, Max Kaiser?
[2:52:14.120 --> 2:52:30.120]  Yeah, well, clearly the U.S. dollar is an endangered species as such, and I think a devaluation is all but certain.
[2:52:30.120 --> 2:52:45.120]  And the question is, there'll be a global devaluation of all the major currencies, and then a revaluation upward for the price of gold. This is exactly what happened in the 1930s.
[2:52:45.120 --> 2:53:01.120]  And to discourage profiteering on the gold side, you might see my friend Eric Jansen over at itoolip.com thinks that they'll impose like a 90% capital gains tax on gold ownership at that point.
[2:53:01.120 --> 2:53:18.120]  So, gold, as you know, I'm a big believer in gold, and I think you have to own gold as a core investment. I think you need it to protect yourself, but it's not as if the government cannot implement strategies to upset the gold only.
[2:53:18.120 --> 2:53:32.120]  Yeah, they won't do a 1933 War Powers Act gold confiscation. They'll just slap a 50, 60, 70, 80, 90% capital gains tax on it, and folks are like, well, I better not do that. Well, that's better than just having them devalue it in the bank or have bank holidays.
[2:53:32.120 --> 2:53:34.120]  I mean, these people...
[2:53:34.120 --> 2:53:57.120]  Yeah, you gotta have a strategy. You really have to get defensive position, because I think what these guys are telegraphing is it's so easy for them to steal so much money these days, I think, that they're telling you that they're coming, and they want you to get in shape and work out and prepare yourself because they want a good fight.
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:54:09.120]  You know, it's like those movies you see sometimes where the sadistic millionaire sets the humans out and goes hunt the humans, but he lets them get a head start because he wants to give himself a little bit of a sport.
[2:54:09.120 --> 2:54:14.120]  And I think what these guys like Cash Carrier are telling the American people is, get ready now because we're coming.
[2:54:14.120 --> 2:54:22.120]  Because he knows he's got the SWAT teams. He's got the military. I mean, he's got it all, and he wants you to know we're going to rape you good. Get ready.
[2:54:22.120 --> 2:54:28.120]  We'll give you a head start, and you know, because we want to make this fun for us.
[2:54:28.120 --> 2:54:32.120]  Yeah, the destruction of America is so much fun.
[2:54:32.120 --> 2:54:48.120]  That's the message that he's saying. I mean, obviously, the fact that the American so-called democracy is toothless in the face of what is obvious tyranny is quite shocking at this point in the country's history.
[2:54:48.120 --> 2:54:52.120]  But Max, as you know, Obama will save us.
[2:54:52.120 --> 2:55:04.120]  Well, you know, that's my last time on your show. I'm not hitting the, you know, anti-Obama button. You know, I'm holding back on my opinion.
[2:55:04.120 --> 2:55:12.120]  I'm going to give the guy a few months in office and then see what happens because, you know, I do think that...
[2:55:12.120 --> 2:55:19.120]  I mean, the guy's a puppet. I mean, if he didn't do what they told him, you know, he'd get a Dealey Plaza visit from the Secret Service that started guarding him.
[2:55:19.120 --> 2:55:27.120]  So we all know that. My whole point is all these Obama no-aids are in for a rude awakening because there's no course changes here. It's full-scale raping.
[2:55:27.120 --> 2:55:33.120]  We'll be right back with Max Kaiser in 60 seconds. Stay with us. Your call straight ahead.
[2:55:33.120 --> 2:55:36.120]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[2:55:36.120 --> 2:55:40.120]  Yeah. Go ahead and leave this on air.
[2:55:40.120 --> 2:55:47.120]  We've been live at prisonplanet.tv for 30 minutes and I want all the prisonplanet.tv listeners out there to be able to tune in and even hear the behind the scenes.
[2:55:47.120 --> 2:55:51.120]  John, give me a new call list so I don't get any of these mixed up.
[2:55:51.120 --> 2:55:52.120]  Please.
[2:55:52.120 --> 2:55:53.120]  Yeah, I'll type that right now.
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:59.120]  Okay, thank you, sir. 1-800-259-9231. Phone calls for Max Kaiser.
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:04.120]  Again, for people out there listening, we're not on the AM and FM dial or shortwave or satellite right now.
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:09.120]  This is prisonplanet.tv viewers and infowars.com exclusive audio stream listeners.
[2:56:09.120 --> 2:56:14.120]  And coming up in about 20 minutes after Max Kaiser leaves this,
[2:56:14.120 --> 2:56:19.120]  we've boiled down from four hours of testimony by the arrogant Kashkari.
[2:56:19.120 --> 2:56:22.120]  And by arrogant, oh, I thank you. I respect you.
[2:56:22.120 --> 2:56:29.120]  Oh, sir, I'm working so hard, but he was just looking at him and the body language was smiling and smirking and just, I don't care. You're a slave. I own you.
[2:56:29.120 --> 2:56:34.120]  We've boiled it down to the most powerful 30 minutes of four hours.
[2:56:34.120 --> 2:56:41.120]  And believe me, it was difficult to cut it down to this because there's so much good stuff there. We've cut out a few of his answers because we kept repeating the same thing over and over again.
[2:56:41.120 --> 2:56:45.120]  That's coming up in 20 minutes after Max Kaiser leaves us right now.
[2:56:45.120 --> 2:56:50.120]  We're going to be taking your phone calls and a host of issues with our guest Max Kaiser.
[2:56:50.120 --> 2:57:10.120]  So stay with us, ladies and gentlemen. Here we go.
[2:57:10.120 --> 2:57:15.120]  Our guest is Max Kaiser for the next 20 minutes. Really appreciate him joining us.
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:22.120]  I want to go ahead and go to your phone calls here in this segment in the next. Mike, David, Kevin, Daniel, and many others holding around the country and the world.
[2:57:22.120 --> 2:57:31.120]  He told me to join us 1-800-25-99-231. I do want to squeeze a lot of calls in those. Just have your question or comment ready so we can get to the next person.
[2:57:31.120 --> 2:57:43.120]  Max, any other points you haven't gotten to? I mean, you were talking about the ships aren't moving, 98% reduction, because no one has money or has the credit to even ship the products.
[2:57:43.120 --> 2:57:50.120]  Same thing with Ford and GM saying that they can't even get the insurance ratings to have their parts suppliers overseas.
[2:57:50.120 --> 2:58:01.120]  These aren't American companies to ship over here. I mean, it looks like the economy is dead, but the brain is still going to get oxygen for a few minutes, maybe six months more.
[2:58:01.120 --> 2:58:05.120]  But it looks like the economy has just come to a standstill.
[2:58:05.120 --> 2:58:18.120]  Yeah, it's a zombie. And if you look at countries around the world, it's already happening. Obviously in Iceland, the entire economy, because of banking tricks that went bad, the entire economy went off line.
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:27.120]  The corona, the Icelandic corona became worthless, and their unlife support system from the IMF, 30% of the population is trying to emigrate out of Iceland today.
[2:58:27.120 --> 2:58:30.120]  30%. Imagine in America, that would be 100 million people.
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:35.120]  And by the way, Iceland was a wondrous first world nation before this.
[2:58:35.120 --> 2:58:43.120]  Iceland six months ago was considered to be, you know, exactly an example of the new world order, if you will, to put it into your terms.
[2:58:43.120 --> 2:58:50.120]  You know, as a shining example of banking as arbitrage of all the banking products that would make everybody rich.
[2:58:50.120 --> 2:58:56.120]  No one could emigrate there. I mean, even if you had 10 million bucks, it was harder to get into than New Zealand.
[2:58:56.120 --> 2:59:05.120]  And the whole thing went offline in a matter of weeks. All the savings in the UK, people put their savings into Iceland because they were getting 6% percent.
[2:59:05.120 --> 2:59:16.120]  All those savings evaporated in one day. The UK government paid off those savers in the UK. Now they're suing Iceland to get the money, as are other countries in Europe and around the world.
[2:59:16.120 --> 2:59:20.120]  And by the way, there's not even food on most of the store shelves in Iceland.
[2:59:20.120 --> 2:59:27.120]  Just like Argentina, folks, because these bankers can't help it. You turn the back, they have to stick it in you.
[2:59:27.120 --> 2:59:33.120]  It's like a psycho that has to kidnap little kids and kill them. I mean, they just got to do it. Max?
[2:59:33.120 --> 2:59:45.120]  Also, on the gold front, you saw over the weekend that the finance minister in Iran has now officially come out and said that they're moving most of their $120 billion reserves into gold billion.
[2:59:45.120 --> 2:59:53.120]  That's right, London Guardian, Iran Switches Reserve to Gold Report, and that's happening all over the world right now, central South America, moving off the dollar.
[2:59:53.120 --> 3:00:00.120]  Meanwhile, the American yuppies are watching football, acting tough, they're delusional, they're stomping around, drinking Kool-Aid.
[3:00:00.120 --> 3:00:05.120]  What is going to happen when the American people find out just how bad they've been set up?
[3:00:05.120 --> 3:00:16.120]  It's like the Sweetie Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. I think I can see a lot of yuppie burgers being served at various outlets.
[3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:22.120]  I agree. In fact, give me the document, Camila, to show folks this London Guardian article. Iran Switches Reserve...
[3:00:22.120 --> 3:00:26.120]  I'm not going to play my video from yesterday. It might be too hot for your show, Alex.
[3:00:26.120 --> 3:00:34.120]  No, it's not that. The audio is distorted, but we are going to play it. I just wanted him to... It's a little overdriven, but it's great from...
[3:00:34.120 --> 3:00:39.120]  Overdriven. Oh, that is code word. That's a code word. I wouldn't expect that from Al Jazeera.
[3:00:39.120 --> 3:00:45.120]  No, no, no, no, no. This is from Al Jazeera. This is when you were on Al Jazeera.
[3:00:45.120 --> 3:00:51.120]  And of course you have a TV show on Al Jazeera, which is, by the way, people say Al Jazeera. That's Saudi Arabia or whatever.
[3:00:51.120 --> 3:00:54.120]  No, folks, this is based out of England. It's like their world service.
[3:00:54.120 --> 3:00:59.120]  Al Jazeera is in Qatar, which has the biggest military base of America outside of the United States.
[3:00:59.120 --> 3:01:04.120]  Qatar, which is where Al Jazeera is. America's ally. Qatar, whatever. I'm always saying it wrong.
[3:01:04.120 --> 3:01:07.120]  Yeah, okay. Now, you also have... Potato patata.
[3:01:07.120 --> 3:01:14.120]  I should remind you, on November 28th, Alex, it looks like the first episode of the Oracle is going to be on BBC World.
[3:01:14.120 --> 3:01:17.120]  And last time I was on your show, I said I was going to invite you.
[3:01:17.120 --> 3:01:24.120]  If in fact we do the November 28th premiere show on BBC World, it goes out to 180 million people.
[3:01:24.120 --> 3:01:26.120]  Max Kaiser presents the Oracle.
[3:01:26.120 --> 3:01:31.120]  I think I got it hooked up. I can bring you in a satellite, do a little, you know, three or four minute interview.
[3:01:31.120 --> 3:01:36.120]  I want it. Let's do it. Please put me on the Oracle produced by Max Kaiser and Alec Baldwin.
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:38.120]  I couldn't think of anything more exciting, but stay there.
[3:01:38.120 --> 3:01:44.120]  By the way, I forgot about your clip, and I'm not afraid to play your clip, but that's a great way to build it up.
[3:01:44.120 --> 3:01:49.120]  MaxKaiser, MaxKaiser.com. Your phone calls straight ahead with our guest. Stay with us.
[3:01:49.120 --> 3:01:54.120]  More than 700...
[3:01:54.120 --> 3:01:56.120]  Now we're going to keep talking. Let me go ahead and talk to Kaiser.
[3:01:56.120 --> 3:01:57.120]  Hey, Max.
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:01:58.120]  Yeah.
[3:01:58.120 --> 3:02:00.120]  Yeah, we're on the internet now.
[3:02:00.120 --> 3:02:03.120]  No, no, we will come back and play that clip. What's about three and a half minutes long?
[3:02:03.120 --> 3:02:07.120]  Yeah, not even a spike. Three. Two and a half minutes.
[3:02:07.120 --> 3:02:10.120]  Let me bring the culprit in. John, we are not making this up.
[3:02:10.120 --> 3:02:14.120]  John, it was telling me it was distorted, but I still said we're going to play it. Right, John?
[3:02:14.120 --> 3:02:21.120]  Yes, sir. You asked if I had acid. Yes, and I told him that it was a little distorted, but we can definitely play it.
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:22.120]  315.
[3:02:22.120 --> 3:02:25.120]  But that's just whoever uploaded it up.
[3:02:25.120 --> 3:02:26.120]  Whoever uploaded it.
[3:02:26.120 --> 3:02:28.120]  Whoever uploaded it up on there. Well, let's do that.
[3:02:28.120 --> 3:02:34.120]  Well, I'll tell you, Alec, I don't come in until 35 seconds. So the first 35 seconds, you can eliminate.
[3:02:34.120 --> 3:02:37.120]  Yeah, it's no big deal. Go ahead and eliminate and just cut right to Kaiser.
[3:02:37.120 --> 3:02:40.120]  Well, you know what? People won't know what it is. Just play the whole thing.
[3:02:40.120 --> 3:02:43.120]  Come in with it and play the music, and we'll go back to MaxKaiser.
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:50.120]  And Max, I love having you on. I really appreciate you. And yes, I want to come on your BBC TV show.
[3:02:50.120 --> 3:03:00.120]  Yeah, you know, when I was doing my Al Jazeera films two years ago, Alec, not a single media outlet in America would even talk to me.
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:07.120]  Well, we are, of course, this alternative radio only on about 70 stations, but we are really honored to have you here.
[3:03:07.120 --> 3:03:13.120]  I mean, the info you're putting out, the info I'm putting out, I'm telling the audience this, is just getting hotter and hotter.
[3:03:13.120 --> 3:03:17.120]  And so that's the exciting thing is that the bankers think they're getting away with this.
[3:03:17.120 --> 3:03:21.120]  I don't think in the final equation they're going to get away with it. What do you say, Max?
[3:03:21.120 --> 3:03:28.120]  Well, as long as there's a spirit of freedom and burning in the hearts of Americans, then the bankers are going to have trouble.
[3:03:28.120 --> 3:03:31.120]  We only have about a minute left before we come back to the full audience.
[3:03:31.120 --> 3:03:38.120]  But behind the scenes, tell folks about the specific stock market system that you're the inventor of, because I find that to be intriguing.
[3:03:38.120 --> 3:03:51.120]  The virtual specialist technology is a technology that allows for a virtual currency to trade on an exchange and you can trade virtual securities.
[3:03:51.120 --> 3:03:56.120]  And the valuation is tied to something intangible, like awareness.
[3:03:56.120 --> 3:04:03.120]  So in the Hollywood Stock Exchange, depending on what people's awareness is of a movie that's going to come out in six months or a year,
[3:04:03.120 --> 3:04:08.120]  their trading, buying and selling those securities creates a need to match those orders.
[3:04:08.120 --> 3:04:15.120]  And to match those orders in a way where all prices over all securities, the prices consistent, there's price parity.
[3:04:15.120 --> 3:04:24.120]  So in the system, the virtual specialist technology is a virtual economy that prices thousands of securities simultaneously within an environment where there is no hard assets,
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:29.120]  like on the New York Stock Exchange, there's still earnings that are tied to profits and cash, etc.
[3:04:29.120 --> 3:04:38.120]  This is based entirely on people's awareness, but you still have price parity, so it's a completely fair system within the economy.
[3:04:38.120 --> 3:04:46.120]  So that system was sold to Cantor Fitzgerald, who moved the technology to the top floor of the World Trade Towers three months before the crash.
[3:04:46.120 --> 3:04:49.120]  That's how I know what was going on in the World Trade Towers.
[3:04:49.120 --> 3:04:55.120]  Stay there, stay there. We're about to go live. We'll finish that story. Here we go.
[3:04:55.120 --> 3:05:05.120]  It's very precise. This is a very complicated problem, and we cannot fix it without some international rules.
[3:05:05.120 --> 3:05:13.120]  Notably absent from the summit's final statement, any detailed plan to help troubled homeowners or struggling workers in the developing world.
[3:05:13.120 --> 3:05:24.120]  This isn't expected, but with economists projecting a global recession that could last upwards of two years, one might be justified in asking whether these leaders really feel the urgency of the situation.
[3:05:24.120 --> 3:05:27.120]  Rosalind Wharton, Al Jazeera, Washington.
[3:05:27.120 --> 3:05:33.120]  Well, let's get a European perspective on all of that. Max Kaiser is a financial culminator based in Paris and joins us live.
[3:05:33.120 --> 3:05:41.120]  Max, positive words there from the world leaders. Will the financial markets be cheering on Monday morning?
[3:05:41.120 --> 3:05:46.120]  No, Bush misspoke. He said that the world's economies were hit hard. That's not true.
[3:05:46.120 --> 3:05:55.120]  The world's counterfeiting schemes were hit hard. The bond to counterfeiting schemes from Wall Street and the city of London were hit hard.
[3:05:55.120 --> 3:06:10.120]  The counterfeiting schemes have been exposed, and the problem is that these G20 nations are not willing to get rid of the scoundrels and the criminals who are running the banks and putting in fraudulent, faulty economy.
[3:06:10.120 --> 3:06:18.120]  Somebody should issue a fought walk against Hank Paulson. Someone should issue a fought walk against Hank Paulson because he's an infidel.
[3:06:18.120 --> 3:06:26.120]  This is the Constitution of the United States. He's not obeying the spirit of the Constitution. He's issuing counterfeit money, counterfeit bonds.
[3:06:26.120 --> 3:06:29.120]  That's why the global economy is in such a sad shape.
[3:06:29.120 --> 3:06:41.120]  The financial terrorists, the hyperbole aside from the Wall Street. That's not the hyperbole. That's not the hyperbole. That's the reality of the situation.
[3:06:41.120 --> 3:06:45.120]  The solution is what?
[3:06:45.120 --> 3:06:56.120]  You have to go into a court of law and take Hank Paulson and Goldman Sachs up for financial terrorism, put them in jail. This is counterfeiting.
[3:06:56.120 --> 3:07:02.120]  They're issuing bonds that are absolutely non-collateralized. There's 500 trillion dollars in which there's no collateral.
[3:07:02.120 --> 3:07:10.120]  That may be one response to Hank Paulson, but as far as the international global economy is concerned, we have matters like should the IMF be reformed?
[3:07:10.120 --> 3:07:16.120]  Should countries like China and India have a bigger say in regulation and moderation of the global markets?
[3:07:16.120 --> 3:07:21.120]  Do any of these get addressed, and are these the way forward?
[3:07:21.120 --> 3:07:29.120]  China, India, Europe, all the banks own structured financial products sold to them from Wall Street.
[3:07:29.120 --> 3:07:37.120]  These are all counterfeit bonds that are exploding. They're worth zero. For example, they have no way of selling these bonds because they have zero value.
[3:07:37.120 --> 3:07:50.120]  As a result, they dump oil. And oil, because they're dumping oil to pay for these fraudulent bonds, the price of oil is dropped, and these developing nations are suffering because of this counterfeiting scheme that has zero value.
[3:07:50.120 --> 3:07:56.120]  Bush is completely incorrect when he says the global economy is suffering. It's the global counterfeiting scheme of suffering.
[3:07:56.120 --> 3:08:00.120]  These guys are criminals. There should be a fought war against these guys. He's an infidel.
[3:08:00.120 --> 3:08:04.120]  Hank Paulson, his head should be bouncing down the Capitol steps.
[3:08:04.120 --> 3:08:05.120]  Max Kai's alive.
[3:08:05.120 --> 3:08:08.120]  I'm sorry, but that's the reality of the situation.
[3:08:08.120 --> 3:08:14.120]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers?
[3:08:14.120 --> 3:08:25.120]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[3:08:25.120 --> 3:08:31.120]  Well, he was speaking, I guess, to the Arabic audience there, though it's big worldwide talking about Fadawas.
[3:08:31.120 --> 3:08:40.120]  But no, Ron Paul said here about a month and a half ago they should all be arrested. They aren't criminals, but they know that they're doing it out of the open, too big to fail, too big to be criminals.
[3:08:40.120 --> 3:08:44.120]  Well, either they fall or we fall.
[3:08:44.120 --> 3:08:52.120]  Max Kaiser. I hadn't seen that clip. I just knew you'd sent it, and so I'd sent it onto the network. Actually, my producer had. Now I know why you wanted it played.
[3:08:52.120 --> 3:09:03.120]  That is some powerful stuff. You know, when I go on Al Jazeera or Press TV or BBC or Russia today, I thought I was getting hardcore on these channels.
[3:09:03.120 --> 3:09:14.120]  My God, Max Kaiser is like the gold standard of in the face telling the truth boldness. I'm actually being put to shame here. I wonder if they'll let me get that wild on there.
[3:09:14.120 --> 3:09:18.120]  Well, I want you on the Oracle, Alex.
[3:09:18.120 --> 3:09:26.120]  Well, I guess you and Alec Baldwin are the producers of it. You think nobody will get upset if I go on there yelling and screaming? Or is this going to be live?
[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:34.120]  This show is going to rip the ball, you know, the cover off the ball. This is going to be the most watched television show in the world.
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:40.120]  We're going to have 100 million viewers. It goes up to 180 million households, half-hour show every Friday night.
[3:09:40.120 --> 3:09:49.120]  We're going to be talking about all the global banking conspiracies and everything else that people are dying to know about, but they're not being told because the mainstream press, even Al Jazeera, is too timid.
[3:09:49.120 --> 3:09:51.120]  So, Alec Baldwin is into all this stuff.
[3:09:51.120 --> 3:10:00.120]  Yeah, he's my co-producer. I've known him for 30 years, and we've been friends for a long, long time, and, you know, we're going to have a blast.
[3:10:00.120 --> 3:10:09.120]  He's going to be a guest. His friends are going to be guests. We've got Satellite Hookup, November 28th, and we're hopefully going to get the first show on the air on the BBC.
[3:10:09.120 --> 3:10:19.120]  Well, hey, count me in. You just have the producers or the people doing the legwork. Tell me where to be, what satellite feed, and hell, if you can't even get a satellite feed in Austin, which I'm sure you'll be able to.
[3:10:19.120 --> 3:10:24.120]  It was hard on election day for some other stations I was on. I'll go wherever I need to be to be on that.
[3:10:24.120 --> 3:10:31.120]  Yeah, that's cool. I mean, you know, the use of the word FATWA, for example, all that means is edict or fiat.
[3:10:31.120 --> 3:10:33.120]  No, I understand. I'm saying arrest them.
[3:10:33.120 --> 3:10:34.120]  Okay, but let me just say...
[3:10:34.120 --> 3:10:36.120]  Guilty, guilty, guilty. Go ahead.
[3:10:36.120 --> 3:10:48.120]  Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke issue a FATWA every day. It's called the U.S. dollar by fiat. The U.S. dollar only has value by Hank Paulson and Ben Bernanke's FATWA.
[3:10:48.120 --> 3:10:56.120]  By the way, you're right about the stock market going down. It's down 85 points today. How far is it going to go down by next February?
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:11:01.120]  Well, it's going to go a lot lower, you know, the stock market, because earnings for these companies are going to collapse.
[3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:03.120]  You know, obviously the unemployment of skyrocketing.
[3:11:03.120 --> 3:11:10.120]  Citibank just announced 50,000 layoffs. The auto industry is going to collapse. I'm not in favor of bailing out the auto industry. I think it's a farce.
[3:11:10.120 --> 3:11:28.120]  Unemployment is going to go to 10%, 11%, 12% at a minimum. And, you know, the earnings are going to collapse. So these companies are going to trade down, you know, the average yield in a bear market gets to 6% or 7%, which means you're talking 3,000 on a Dow Jones.
[3:11:28.120 --> 3:11:39.120]  Doesn't look good. You know, I want to jam in a few calls. The interview is almost over. Time just flies because I promised to play these highlights of the amazing Kashkari committee hearings last...
[3:11:39.120 --> 3:11:47.120]  last Friday. But I want to go to Mike, David, Kevin, Daniel, Rob. Guys, just ask one question of Kaiser, quickly, please. I want to get you on.
[3:11:47.120 --> 3:11:49.120]  Mike in California, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:11:49.120 --> 3:11:51.120]  Only one question.
[3:11:51.120 --> 3:11:53.120]  Go ahead.
[3:11:53.120 --> 3:11:55.120]  Only one question, Alex.
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:12:00.120]  Oh, man. Anyway, let me pick my best one.
[3:12:00.120 --> 3:12:04.120]  Just ask them all over and spend time to figure out which one to ask. Go ahead.
[3:12:04.120 --> 3:12:06.120]  Sorry about that, Alex.
[3:12:06.120 --> 3:12:09.120]  No, no, don't be sorry. I'm sorry. I don't have enough time.
[3:12:09.120 --> 3:12:13.120]  Hell hell, I'll just skip playing the clips. We'll play them tomorrow. We got plenty of time. Go ahead.
[3:12:13.120 --> 3:12:17.120]  Yeah, just sit back and hear the question.
[3:12:17.120 --> 3:12:28.120]  All right. Well, okay, with the fires occurring in California and all these people losing their homes and whatnot, were there insurance companies to be able to cover them?
[3:12:28.120 --> 3:12:37.120]  Oh, no. I mean, in the short term, perhaps, but look, the insurance company are part and parcel of this global credit crunch. They're running out of money.
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:41.120]  Even Warren Buffett, you know, his stock is down 50% this year. He's a big insurance company.
[3:12:41.120 --> 3:12:52.120]  Look, what happened is they took the cop tuitions, the police, the teacher, retirement funds. It was all invested in derivatives. The bankers stole it all.
[3:12:52.120 --> 3:13:01.120]  Yeah, or, you know, the thing is that if, in fact, by some stroke of luck, you do get some insurance money on this disaster, your rates are going to be underrocketed the next quarter.
[3:13:01.120 --> 3:13:10.120]  So you won't be able to afford insurance anymore going forward, just like in Katrina disaster. Everyone can't afford flood insurance in New Orleans anymore.
[3:13:10.120 --> 3:13:16.120]  The rates were jacked up. So the rates for insurance are going to go a lot higher with every single one of these disasters.
[3:13:16.120 --> 3:13:20.120]  So the insurance industry, which is the backbone of capitalism, is going out of business.
[3:13:20.120 --> 3:13:25.120]  Yeah, look, down the road, folks, you're not getting your social security. You're not getting your insurance.
[3:13:25.120 --> 3:13:30.120]  All you're getting is a forced labor camp unless we throw these people out. Mike, anything else?
[3:13:30.120 --> 3:13:45.120]  Okay, I guess I'll ask this question for you because I want to try to squeeze in some for both. For you, Alex, do you think that it will be easy for the police state to confiscate guns from people as it was for them in New Orleans?
[3:13:45.120 --> 3:13:52.120]  No, because they had a, well, I mean, unless I'm going to let you go, I appreciate the call. Mike, you can call back later whether it calls me one tomorrow or so.
[3:13:52.120 --> 3:14:01.120]  That was an isolated incident. They had the cover of the disaster to do it. It was a beta test, a laboratory test to see if they could do it and how it would sell the public.
[3:14:01.120 --> 3:14:09.120]  It didn't go well for them. They're just going to do stuff like turn the money off, let everybody riot, then the public will beg to turn their guns in. Max Kaiser?
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:17.120]  Yeah, agreed. I have an idea for American. Start a new 12-step program. It's called Goldman Sachs Anonymous.
[3:14:17.120 --> 3:14:25.120]  Everyone gets together in a church basement and they go the 12 steps of Goldman Sachs Anonymous that we are powerless over Goldman Sachs.
[3:14:25.120 --> 3:14:35.120]  Now, it sounds a bit glib, but on the other hand, it's a way for people to reach out to their neighbor because one thing that's going to get people through this crisis is it's going to be neighbor to neighbor.
[3:14:35.120 --> 3:14:42.120]  So, get to know your neighbors. Get to know the people around you because that's going to be key to your survival, I think.
[3:14:42.120 --> 3:14:47.120]  It could bring people together, unfortunately, in a crisis, but generally that's what happens.
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:53.120]  Absolutely. Let's go to one more caller here. David in Michigan, you're on the air with Max Kaiser.
[3:14:53.120 --> 3:15:06.120]  Great discussion, guys. One question. I'll be brief with it. Because China owns so much of our treasury bills and the trade-off is so high, what role do you think that China is going to play in this post-economic meltdown?
[3:15:06.120 --> 3:15:12.120]  I mean, Alex, you know as well as I do, this country is a new world order's dream. They loved it on every country like this.
[3:15:12.120 --> 3:15:16.120]  I mean, after it's all said and done, the dust, how are we going to be slaves to the Chinese Empire?
[3:15:16.120 --> 3:15:27.120]  I think this is going to hurt the Chinese as well. I think they're going to have their hands full there. I mean, most economists say if China ever gets down to 7% unemployment, they'd melt down.
[3:15:27.120 --> 3:15:31.120]  Or if their growth drops to 6%, they're dead meat. Max Kaiser?
[3:15:31.120 --> 3:15:37.120]  Who took the Bank of China public two years ago in the biggest IPO in the history of the world?
[3:15:37.120 --> 3:15:38.120]  Tell us.
[3:15:38.120 --> 3:15:40.120]  Answer? Goldman Sachs.
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:49.120]  Okay, Goldman Sachs. Hank Paulson is there. He made something like 14 trips to China during his last year at Goldman Sachs. He is completely in the China's pocket.
[3:15:49.120 --> 3:15:56.120]  That's right. He was the Goldman Sachs guy. That was his first big job there decades ago, was Goldman Sachs's minion in China.
[3:15:56.120 --> 3:16:05.120]  You know, his first big job was working for Richard Nixon in Washington. And he was definitely with China. They've got that huge IPO.
[3:16:05.120 --> 3:16:14.120]  And, you know, I think that China has said that they're transitioning out of dollars into gold as well. They have to do that to be careful because they...
[3:16:14.120 --> 3:16:22.120]  Well, Cheney got out of dollars two years ago. I mean, everybody's moving to Dubai. I guess, why is Dubai, Max, the place to be for the elites?
[3:16:22.120 --> 3:16:25.120]  No extradition law.
[3:16:25.120 --> 3:16:32.120]  There goes your answer. You know, we're going to talk behind the scenes just for the Internet audience and then let Max Kaiser go because I've got to air at least most of this 30 minutes.
[3:16:32.120 --> 3:16:37.120]  And tomorrow I'll air more and comment on it. But I promised I had people come in and edit this four hours down to 30 minutes.
[3:16:37.120 --> 3:16:41.120]  So that is coming up. So we appreciate Max Kaiser joining us, MaxKaiser.com.
[3:16:41.120 --> 3:16:49.120]  That's it for the full interview. We'll talk for four minutes behind the scenes and come out with the audio clip. Here we go.
[3:16:49.120 --> 3:16:59.120]  Okay, Max, again, let's take a few more calls here. Kevin in New York. Kevin, you're on the air with Max Kaiser. Go ahead.
[3:16:59.120 --> 3:17:00.120]  Come on, Kevin.
[3:17:00.120 --> 3:17:01.120]  Hey, Kevin.
[3:17:01.120 --> 3:17:02.120]  Yes.
[3:17:02.120 --> 3:17:04.120]  Go ahead. You're on the air.
[3:17:04.120 --> 3:17:15.120]  This is with regards to the conversation they had with Lente a little earlier ago and how the government is consolidating and the, you know, is the command and control type thing.
[3:17:15.120 --> 3:17:27.120]  And I just like to reference that in terms of a new article by Naomi Klein in Rolling Stone, the new trough, and she referred to the Bank of New York Mellon as being the kind of general contractor for the bailout.
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:37.120]  So, you know, just two images here. One is that the government is consolidating the corporations, and the other is that the corporations are consolidating or privatizing the government.
[3:17:37.120 --> 3:17:39.120]  And your comments, and I'll take them off air.
[3:17:39.120 --> 3:17:47.120]  It's just a mass raping. I mean, government corporations at the top, it's all one animal, and it's just total booty.
[3:17:47.120 --> 3:17:55.120]  It's total just grabbing, stealing, gobbling, laughing, giggling. It's just a neo-esque insanity, Max Kaiser.
[3:17:55.120 --> 3:18:03.120]  Well, balance sheet consolidation. You know, for example, when Bear Stearns blew up, the fact is that Bear Stearns wasn't the problem case.
[3:18:03.120 --> 3:18:11.120]  JP Morgan was the problem. JP Morgan had unbelievable amounts of derivative contracts with no counterparty able to satisfy.
[3:18:11.120 --> 3:18:18.120]  And so what they did was they blew up Bear Stearns to get rid of the counterparty that could make claims against JP Morgan.
[3:18:18.120 --> 3:18:24.120]  JP Morgan assassinated Bear Stearns for their own good. That company was assassinated.
[3:18:24.120 --> 3:18:26.120]  That's what a lot of experts...
[3:18:26.120 --> 3:18:29.120]  You see a lot of this consolidation of balance sheets in the banking industry.
[3:18:29.120 --> 3:18:34.120]  So Bank A goes to Bank B and says, oh, we've got these risks. You've got those risks with these assets.
[3:18:34.120 --> 3:18:37.120]  You know, when I was working on Wall Street, we used to do a thing called Swapping Dead Books.
[3:18:37.120 --> 3:18:43.120]  So if I'm a broker and I'm working in one brokerage firm, and I've blown up a lot of customers,
[3:18:43.120 --> 3:18:48.120]  I can go across the street to the broker, and the other brokerage firm was blown up a lot of customers, and we swap each other's blown up customers.
[3:18:48.120 --> 3:18:55.120]  Then I call up his blown up customers and I say, hey, you know, I got a great stock tip for you. I already know his name is a brokerage account,
[3:18:55.120 --> 3:18:59.120]  his social security number, and I know what stocks he's owned, and I know how much he's lost.
[3:18:59.120 --> 3:19:04.120]  And I can just put into my pitch, well, I think you could make excellent amount of money, and I hope you didn't buy this other stock last year.
[3:19:04.120 --> 3:19:06.120]  That was last year's loser.
[3:19:06.120 --> 3:19:10.120]  And then meanwhile, the broker who I swapped Dead Books is doing the same thing at his firm.
[3:19:10.120 --> 3:19:16.120]  So now you're seeing banks do that with each other. They're swapping each other's dead clients and dead bonds for fees.
[3:19:16.120 --> 3:19:20.120]  And it's just another chapter in this huge policy scheme.
[3:19:20.120 --> 3:19:26.120]  And the government's going to come out and scalp the public to feed it to the bankers who sit there like 800-pound children,
[3:19:26.120 --> 3:19:28.120]  gobbling our society.
[3:19:28.120 --> 3:19:35.120]  Daniel in Texas, last caller for Max Kaiser.
[3:19:35.120 --> 3:19:39.120]  These callers are really taking their time today. Daniel, go ahead.
[3:19:39.120 --> 3:19:41.120]  They're in shock.
[3:19:41.120 --> 3:19:50.120]  I would like to ask my chouser, why is the construct trying to destroy the middle class and at the same time trying to give us this map to Superhighway?
[3:19:50.120 --> 3:19:53.120]  They're going to be buying all the goods that they ship in.
[3:19:53.120 --> 3:19:59.120]  Well, after they can solid everything, they'll start the economy back over again, and they want to tax all the roads,
[3:19:59.120 --> 3:20:02.120]  and those will be multinational corridors, Mr. Kaiser.
[3:20:02.120 --> 3:20:07.120]  Right, but if they toll booths on those roads, you're not going to be owned by Americans.
[3:20:07.120 --> 3:20:12.120]  They spend generations building an infrastructure, roads, bridges, and tunnels, and they should get the fees on the toll booths,
[3:20:12.120 --> 3:20:15.120]  but those toll booths are being sold to our foreign senators in China.
[3:20:15.120 --> 3:20:19.120]  Hey, we're out of time, Daniel, and I'm sorry to Rob and George and everybody else.
[3:20:19.120 --> 3:20:22.120]  Call back next time Kaiser's on. You'll go to the head of the line.
[3:20:22.120 --> 3:20:25.120]  MaxKaiser.com.
[3:20:25.120 --> 3:20:33.120]  I want to really thank you for having me on the show, and you've got my office number or Trey's email if you want me on that 28th.
[3:20:33.120 --> 3:20:38.120]  And if I can't make it for that, or if you can't have me on then, I'll be glad to come on to the second one or whatever.
[3:20:38.120 --> 3:20:40.120]  And thanks for spending time with us, Max.
[3:20:40.120 --> 3:20:42.120]  Thanks, Alex. Great show.
[3:20:42.120 --> 3:20:45.120]  Appreciate you coming on. MaxKaiser.com. Take care.
[3:20:45.120 --> 3:20:52.120]  Alright, there goes Max Kaiser from Paris, from Paris, where my wife wants to move, or we never will move.
[3:20:52.120 --> 3:20:55.120]  Alright, here we go.
[3:20:55.120 --> 3:21:01.120]  Okay, we're going to go ahead and go for this segment for the rest of the show.
[3:21:01.120 --> 3:21:06.120]  With 30 minutes, we may not even get to all of this.
[3:21:06.120 --> 3:21:11.120]  Yeah, I really should just play this tomorrow and then stop and comment on it, because there's so many facets to it.
[3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:15.120]  But this is Kashkari being grilled.
[3:21:15.120 --> 3:21:19.120]  This is only 30 minutes of four hours of the hearings last Friday.
[3:21:19.120 --> 3:21:23.120]  Tomorrow I'm going to play some more of this in the end of it, and then comment more on it.
[3:21:23.120 --> 3:21:27.120]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen, so stay with us.
[3:21:27.120 --> 3:21:50.120]  I heard your testimony, and I have to say that I'm a little bit surprised because it appears that testimony was prepared before Mr. Paulson's statement about the purposes of the Troubled Asset Relief Program.
[3:21:50.120 --> 3:22:08.120]  And the Secretary's decision not to purchase mortgage assets through his decision, hasn't Treasury rendered obsolete entire sections of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act?
[3:22:08.120 --> 3:22:16.120]  Because there was no question about congressional intention that Treasury use an asset purchase program to mitigate foreclosures.
[3:22:16.120 --> 3:22:19.120]  You have a response to that?
[3:22:19.120 --> 3:22:26.120]  We worked very hard with both houses of Congress to design the legislation to provide a lot of flexibility.
[3:22:26.120 --> 3:22:35.120]  And we and the other regulators are using every tool at our disposal to get this problem, stabilizing the financial system as well as helping homeowners.
[3:22:35.120 --> 3:22:48.120]  And Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke and at Treasury, we have been looking at how do we deploy these resources to first stabilize the system so that we can get credit flowing to the entire economy, to our communities.
[3:22:48.120 --> 3:22:56.120]  Secretary Paulson made the determination that the best way to get at this problem, given how rapidly markets were deteriorating, was to lead with capital.
[3:22:56.120 --> 3:23:01.120]  But that doesn't mean that we don't care about other aspects that are very, very important.
[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:04.120]  We're trying to use the right tool to solve the right problem.
[3:23:04.120 --> 3:23:18.120]  What would appear, Mr. Kashkari, that Secretary Paulson has gutted Section 109 of the Act, which requires Treasury to undertake specified steps to mitigate foreclosures with respect to the mortgages it acquires,
[3:23:18.120 --> 3:23:30.120]  including working with other federal regulators to identify troubled assets to acquire further loan modification efforts?
[3:23:30.120 --> 3:23:36.120]  How do you reconcile this policy reversal with Congress's expectations laid out in the statute?
[3:23:36.120 --> 3:23:53.120]  Congressman, there are other sections of the Act as an example that direct other government agencies, whether it's FHFA in its conservatorship of the GSEs, FHA, the Federal Reserve, to the extent that they own or control mortgages to take action.
[3:23:53.120 --> 3:23:56.120]  So let me give you an example, Congressman, because this point is very important.
[3:23:56.120 --> 3:24:08.120]  If we had spent all $700 billion buying loans, that would be around 3 million loans or so, depending on the value of the loans, but around 3 million, 3.5 million.
[3:24:08.120 --> 3:24:17.120]  Instead, if you look at the actions that we took on Tuesday by using the GSEs to now set a new industry standard for loan servicing,
[3:24:17.120 --> 3:24:24.120]  when the GSE set a standard, other servicers around the country use that standard, whether it's for GSE loans or for other loans,
[3:24:24.120 --> 3:24:31.120]  those actions and that protocol has the ability to influence servicing for almost every loan in America.
[3:24:31.120 --> 3:24:37.120]  There are 55 million residential mortgages in America, so it could touch 3 million or 55.
[3:24:37.120 --> 3:24:50.120]  So it has the ability, but the problem is that Treasury, by taking this action that de-emphasizes loan modification, has essentially sent a signal to all the banks that this isn't particularly what you're concerned about.
[3:24:50.120 --> 3:24:54.120]  I mean, even though you may maintain, oh, this is in there, look, I've got the act.
[3:24:54.120 --> 3:24:55.120]  Here's the purposes.
[3:24:55.120 --> 3:24:56.120]  I want to spell them out.
[3:24:56.120 --> 3:25:04.120]  The purposes of the act are, and number two, to ensure that such authority and facilities are used in a manner that protects home values.
[3:25:04.120 --> 3:25:09.120]  And then it goes on to section B, preserves home ownership.
[3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:13.120]  Now, the Treasury just basically cut that out of the bill.
[3:25:13.120 --> 3:25:23.120]  And what we have here is a situation where banks are hoarding the money that they're getting from the tarp.
[3:25:23.120 --> 3:25:25.120]  They're using the money to purchase other banks.
[3:25:25.120 --> 3:25:27.120]  We still have a credit freeze.
[3:25:27.120 --> 3:25:28.120]  I'm looking at your testimony.
[3:25:28.120 --> 3:25:36.120]  You're saying credit markets were largely frozen, denying financial institutions, businesses, consumers, access to vital funding and credit.
[3:25:36.120 --> 3:25:39.120]  Financial institutions were under extreme pressure.
[3:25:39.120 --> 3:25:43.120]  Investor confidence in our system was dangerously low.
[3:25:43.120 --> 3:25:45.120]  Hello, are we in a different universe here?
[3:25:45.120 --> 3:25:49.120]  This same situation prevails today.
[3:25:49.120 --> 3:25:55.120]  And yet your testimony acts as though, well, you know, we're just merrily skipping along our way here.
[3:25:55.120 --> 3:25:58.120]  We've got millions of people threatened with losing their homes.
[3:25:58.120 --> 3:26:05.120]  And the underlying problem is that banks are now increasing their interest rates in order to get more customers.
[3:26:05.120 --> 3:26:06.120]  Think about this now.
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:10.120]  It's counterintuitive to your troubled asset relief program.
[3:26:10.120 --> 3:26:18.120]  You're now saying we're going to put the money into the banks, into these financial institutions, shore up finance capital.
[3:26:18.120 --> 3:26:27.120]  Well, finance capital now is seeing that the only way they can survive is to start to raise their interest rates and give away some of the money that the government's giving to them.
[3:26:27.120 --> 3:26:30.120]  At the same time, you're picking winners and losers.
[3:26:30.120 --> 3:26:33.120]  How do you reconcile these policy reversals?
[3:26:33.120 --> 3:26:42.120]  You know, and why won't Treasury act swiftly and forcefully to maximize this system?
[3:26:42.120 --> 3:26:46.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[3:26:46.120 --> 3:26:53.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[3:26:53.120 --> 3:26:55.120]  Hello, I'm Steve Shank.
[3:26:55.120 --> 3:27:07.120]  We're entering a holiday season never before seen in America. We're thankful for the warning given by members of Mr. Obama's campaign team of the coming international incident, which will force unpopular decisions.
[3:27:07.120 --> 3:27:18.120]  Without this warning, many of us who still have money available would have unknowingly wasted on a Christmas gifts that will be useless when the only food available isn't a government breadline.
[3:27:18.120 --> 3:27:27.120]  When the president is faced with the expected national security incident, the in-place patriot legislation will control transport and distribution of food.
[3:27:27.120 --> 3:27:31.120]  Those of us who are able to take care of ourselves must put in supplies of food.
[3:27:31.120 --> 3:27:37.120]  This will free up the relief organizations to give food to those unable or not smart enough to prepare.
[3:27:37.120 --> 3:27:52.120]  The greatest gift this Christmas is life itself, food for these unknown times. Call 800-409-5633 on the web, eFoodsDirect.com, 800-409-5633.
[3:27:52.120 --> 3:27:59.120]  A day unlike any other in the long course of American history, a terrorist act of war against this country.
[3:27:59.120 --> 3:28:03.120]  The enemy struck America on September 11th. But who is the enemy?
[3:28:03.120 --> 3:28:08.120]  Bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden.
[3:28:08.120 --> 3:28:15.120]  Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside the United States.
[3:28:15.120 --> 3:28:22.120]  Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S.
[3:28:22.120 --> 3:28:26.120]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:28:26.120 --> 3:28:32.120]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli Intelligence Network.
[3:28:32.120 --> 3:28:37.120]  Warnings and war games, the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled Enemies.

[3:29:15.120 --> 3:29:19.120]  Put together with a realistic understanding of what the dangers will be.
[3:29:19.120 --> 3:29:27.120]  Reignar Benson also said, why retreat? This is a question that 90% of our population cannot and will not answer.
[3:29:27.120 --> 3:29:33.120]  If they could, that same 90% would have to admit that things may not continue on as they are now.
[3:29:33.120 --> 3:29:39.120]  They would also have to admit that they will need a retreat. Something completely impossible for the average American to do.
[3:29:39.120 --> 3:29:47.120]  That's now before it's too late. In order to find your new, high-security, self-sufficient, off-grid, beautiful retreat property,

[3:30:17.120 --> 3:30:30.120]  At the same time you're picking winners and losers, how do you reconcile these policy reversals?
[3:30:30.120 --> 3:30:38.120]  And why won't Treasury act swiftly and forcefully to maximize assistance to homeowners under tarp
[3:30:38.120 --> 3:30:44.120]  and play a significant role in modification of home loans at risk of imminent default?
[3:30:44.120 --> 3:30:46.120]  Why not?
[3:30:46.120 --> 3:30:52.120]  Congressman, I personally have spent most of the past year and a half focused on ways to try to leech and help homeowners.
[3:30:52.120 --> 3:30:57.120]  That's been my primary focus within Treasury.
[3:30:57.120 --> 3:31:04.120]  Hasn't the Secretary listened to you? Do you feel frustrated that your position isn't being vindicated?
[3:31:04.120 --> 3:31:07.120]  Congressman, the Secretary is passionate about this as well.
[3:31:07.120 --> 3:31:14.120]  He's passionate about what? Helping homeowners, Congressman. He is? Where? What country?
[3:31:14.120 --> 3:31:20.120]  We are, Congressman, we are using all the tools available to the federal government to get out of the credit crisis
[3:31:20.120 --> 3:31:25.120]  and try to help homeowners. Let me give you an example, please. We have different tools.
[3:31:25.120 --> 3:31:32.120]  Mr. Kashkari, I really respect you being here, but I'm looking at a bill, Section 109, that spells all this out.
[3:31:32.120 --> 3:31:37.120]  The Secretary just essentially took some scissors and cut it out and threw it away.
[3:31:37.120 --> 3:31:41.120]  Now, you know, maybe this is just some kind of a game to some people in the administration.
[3:31:41.120 --> 3:31:44.120]  They're on their way out of office and they just feel they can do whatever they want.
[3:31:44.120 --> 3:31:47.120]  Pick winners and lose in the market. We have millions of people losing their home.
[3:31:47.120 --> 3:31:53.120]  Mr. Issa came to my district and saw some of our old neighborhoods, how they're just falling apart.
[3:31:53.120 --> 3:31:57.120]  And we've got people that are holding on, hoping against hope that somebody's going to help them.
[3:31:57.120 --> 3:32:02.120]  We've got millions of people in foreclosure and, if I read it right, Mr. Issa, in California,
[3:32:02.120 --> 3:32:09.120]  there are millions more at risk of foreclosure with these jumble mortgages and the all-aim mortgages in 09 and 10.
[3:32:09.120 --> 3:32:13.120]  And all of a sudden, the Treasury sent a signal to the banks, forget about it.
[3:32:13.120 --> 3:32:16.120]  We're going to give you the money that you want and you do what you want with it.
[3:32:16.120 --> 3:32:20.120]  Unless you direct it specifically, it's not going to happen.
[3:32:20.120 --> 3:32:27.120]  So tell me again, why isn't it happening? Not how passionate the Treasury Secretary is.
[3:32:27.120 --> 3:32:31.120]  Congressman, I believe it is happening. If you permit me, I'll walk you through.
[3:32:31.120 --> 3:32:36.120]  Please go ahead. The four banking regulators. The Treasury is not a regulatory agency.
[3:32:36.120 --> 3:32:41.120]  The banking regulators supervise the banks that are getting this capital.
[3:32:41.120 --> 3:32:46.120]  The four banking regulators put out a joint statement that's going to govern how they supervise these banks.
[3:32:46.120 --> 3:32:51.120]  One of the things that they're going to be looking very closely at and watching, not just executive compensation,
[3:32:51.120 --> 3:32:57.120]  not just dividend policies, making sure lending is getting out there in our communities and foreclosure mitigation efforts.
[3:32:57.120 --> 3:33:03.120]  The banking regulators are the supervisors of these institutions and they've now put out a joint statement saying exactly
[3:33:03.120 --> 3:33:06.120]  what they're going to be looking at in their supervisory capacity.
[3:33:06.120 --> 3:33:11.120]  There is no one better positioned in the country than the banking regulators to do that.
[3:33:11.120 --> 3:33:14.120]  Treasury is not in a position to do that, but the banking regulators absolutely are.
[3:33:14.120 --> 3:33:18.120]  We've done numerous initiatives to try to get at the root of this problem,
[3:33:18.120 --> 3:33:23.120]  but the most important benefit, Congressman, for homeowners is that we didn't allow the financial system to collapse.
[3:33:23.120 --> 3:33:30.120]  Imagine how many foreclosures we would have if the banking system had collapsed and mortgage finance was not available to our homeowners.
[3:33:30.120 --> 3:33:33.120]  That's the biggest benefit that we've been able to achieve.
[3:33:33.120 --> 3:33:37.120]  Chairman, we are not out of the woods yet, and I didn't mean to suggest that in my testimony,
[3:33:37.120 --> 3:33:43.120]  but I can walk through numerous statistics looking at the beginning of a healing credit market, which is the first step to getting through this problem.
[3:33:43.120 --> 3:33:48.120]  Well, maybe, you know, see again, this might be a philosophical divide here,
[3:33:48.120 --> 3:33:55.120]  because on one hand, the Bush administration and Treasury seems to indicate that the trickle-down effect,
[3:33:55.120 --> 3:34:00.120]  give the money to banks and they're going to loosen up money and credit and start going to start to flow and people are going to be protected.
[3:34:00.120 --> 3:34:07.120]  On the other hand, there's another model which says create a system where you get pools of mortgage-backed securities,
[3:34:07.120 --> 3:34:14.120]  the government takes control over and you direct loan modification, you know, lowering interest, lowering principal,
[3:34:14.120 --> 3:34:17.120]  extending the terms of payments to keep people in their home.
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:24.120]  One model may keep several big banks afloat, but risk millions of people losing their home anyway,
[3:34:24.120 --> 3:34:26.120]  and the other model keeps people in their homes.
[3:34:26.120 --> 3:34:28.120]  See, you're talking about an IFCOM model.
[3:34:28.120 --> 3:34:35.120]  It's based on the charitable sentiment, seemingly, of major Wall Street banks.
[3:34:35.120 --> 3:34:40.120]  But the truth of the matter is, if you don't get the money into the grassroots and help on loan modification,
[3:34:40.120 --> 3:34:46.120]  the banks aren't going to get their money to begin at the end anyhow, because, you know, one model percolates up,
[3:34:46.120 --> 3:34:49.120]  money goes to the banks, help move money in Wall Street.
[3:34:49.120 --> 3:34:54.120]  The other one, you have this idea of some kind of trickle-down, a trickle never gets down, everybody understands that.
[3:34:54.120 --> 3:35:02.120]  And yet, Treasury seems to cling to this notion that if only the regulators now do their job.
[3:35:02.120 --> 3:35:03.120]  Are you kidding me?
[3:35:03.120 --> 3:35:08.120]  I mean, regulators, look, Treasury has been given almost omnipotent power here,
[3:35:08.120 --> 3:35:13.120]  and you have, unfortunately, you know, not exercising the interest of homeowners.
[3:35:13.120 --> 3:35:19.120]  Do you believe that Congress would have passed the EESA if it understood that none of the tarp funds
[3:35:19.120 --> 3:35:24.120]  would have been earmarked for asset purchase and subsequent mortgage loan modifications?
[3:35:24.120 --> 3:35:27.120]  I mean, this looks like classic bait-and-switch.
[3:35:27.120 --> 3:35:28.120]  Mr. Issa.
[3:35:28.120 --> 3:35:29.120]  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[3:35:29.120 --> 3:35:35.120]  Mr. Kashari, I appreciate that you were in on those negotiations with leadership.
[3:35:35.120 --> 3:35:41.120]  The majority of Republicans voted against it once and twice.
[3:35:41.120 --> 3:35:49.120]  Mr. Kucinich wasn't in the meeting where Secretary Paulson came in with the Vice President and Fed Chairman Bernanke,
[3:35:49.120 --> 3:36:00.120]  and made all these assurances that there was absolutely a critical, immediate need to get rid of the corrosive derivative products.
[3:36:00.120 --> 3:36:02.120]  You know, all the different names for this.
[3:36:02.120 --> 3:36:10.120]  And, you know, ubiquitous, you know, sub-S, retraded credit default swap, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[3:36:10.120 --> 3:36:11.120]  Okay?
[3:36:11.120 --> 3:36:16.120]  But they talked about them as though they knew what the hell they were.
[3:36:16.120 --> 3:36:23.120]  You got the money and you immediately said what items, what auction?
[3:36:23.120 --> 3:36:27.120]  Would you please respond to under oath?
[3:36:27.120 --> 3:36:33.120]  When did you go from what you told members of Congress in open and closed sessions,
[3:36:33.120 --> 3:36:39.120]  was the absolute reason to have this money immediately to buy a specific group of assets,
[3:36:39.120 --> 3:36:48.120]  about $350 billion in the U.S., about $350 billion held by other countries and other funds outside the U.S.?
[3:36:48.120 --> 3:36:52.120]  Those assets were what you said was locking up and destroying the market.
[3:36:52.120 --> 3:36:57.120]  When did you first hear that that money was not going to be spent that way?
[3:36:57.120 --> 3:37:04.120]  Congressman, the day on October 3, the day that the Congress passed and the President signed the legislation,
[3:37:04.120 --> 3:37:09.120]  we immediately created several policy teams developing asset purchase programs,
[3:37:09.120 --> 3:37:12.120]  all the details, both mortgage-backed security.
[3:37:12.120 --> 3:37:13.120]  That wasn't the question.
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:18.120]  I want to know the time and date because I want to know whether Congress was lied to
[3:37:18.120 --> 3:37:24.120]  or whether there was a team all along that had an alternate, one or more people,
[3:37:24.120 --> 3:37:28.120]  that had an alternate idea of how this money would be spent.
[3:37:28.120 --> 3:37:32.120]  Congressman, forgive me, on October 3, we created a team.
[3:37:32.120 --> 3:37:34.120]  That's not answering the question.
[3:37:34.120 --> 3:37:37.120]  Here's the reason I'm asking a very directed question.
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:39.120]  You can create the team.
[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:40.120]  You can put together all that.
[3:37:40.120 --> 3:37:49.120]  Circuit City, and I sold them for 20-plus years, so I'm very sensitive to the trouble they're in.
[3:37:49.120 --> 3:37:53.120]  Circuit City announced that they were closing 155 stores and began that process.
[3:37:53.120 --> 3:37:56.120]  They never announced they were filing Chapter 11.
[3:37:56.120 --> 3:38:03.120]  But all of us looked and said, look, they're not going to renegotiate walking away from 155 leases without a bankruptcy.
[3:38:03.120 --> 3:38:05.120]  So in our minds, we knew.
[3:38:05.120 --> 3:38:06.120]  It's a question of time.
[3:38:06.120 --> 3:38:10.120]  Well, they don't tell you one thing, they do tell you another.
[3:38:10.120 --> 3:38:17.120]  You never, in any good faith, explained why you formed these organizations,
[3:38:17.120 --> 3:38:23.120]  and now you say it's hopeless and impossible to buy these products that were the entire reason.
[3:38:23.120 --> 3:38:30.120]  You can't have the success for doing something different than you said without explaining why you didn't buy one of those assets.
[3:38:30.120 --> 3:38:39.120]  And when did somebody figure out, by date, when did you first learn that we were not going to buy these assets because we couldn't value them properly?
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:43.120]  First of all, Congressman, it's not a question of our ability to value them.
[3:38:43.120 --> 3:38:50.120]  The decision was made by Secretary Paulson very recently, as earlier this week, late last week.
[3:38:50.120 --> 3:39:05.120]  Secondly, it has been said that your purchases of 250 billion plus a preferred stock is at a price that would not be market competitive,
[3:39:05.120 --> 3:39:07.120]  meaning you paid too much.
[3:39:07.120 --> 3:39:17.120]  Tell me why I'm to believe for a minute that those preferred stocks that you bought, you could resell today for anything closed.
[3:39:17.120 --> 3:39:20.120]  Remember, the market has improved, you've said that.
[3:39:20.120 --> 3:39:27.120]  Tell me what the profit would be on those preferred stocks if you put them, began putting even one dollar amount into the market today.
[3:39:27.120 --> 3:39:30.120]  Congressman, I don't know what the price would be.
[3:39:30.120 --> 3:39:32.120]  You're from Goldman Sachs.
[3:39:32.120 --> 3:39:34.120]  I used to work there.
[3:39:34.120 --> 3:39:39.120]  I'm from Directed Electronics, you're from your last job.
[3:39:39.120 --> 3:39:48.120]  If you tell me that you've improved the market, then by definition those assets, if bought at par, have appreciated. Isn't that true?
[3:39:48.120 --> 3:39:52.120]  Well, there are many, again, with deep respect, Congressman, there are many different markets.
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:54.120]  There's the equity market, there's the credit markets.
[3:39:54.120 --> 3:39:56.120]  I think there are strong signs.
[3:39:56.120 --> 3:40:01.120]  I can walk you through data showing the credit markets improving, the equity markets, we purchase equity.
[3:40:01.120 --> 3:40:04.120]  You purchase the debt instrument.
[3:40:04.120 --> 3:40:07.120]  Well, it's tier one capital, Congressman.
[3:40:07.120 --> 3:40:18.120]  We can go ring around the rosy here, but you're here today because Congress is feeling that you played a bait-and-switch game and you're not convincing anyone that you haven't.
[3:40:18.120 --> 3:40:21.120]  But let's just try to go to the fundamentals.
[3:40:21.120 --> 3:40:22.120]  You bought preferred stock.
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:23.120]  Yes, sir.
[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:25.120]  Preferred stock is a debt instrument.
[3:40:25.120 --> 3:40:29.120]  You're capitalizing the company, but you're capitalizing with a debt instrument.
[3:40:29.120 --> 3:40:38.120]  Those instruments trade. I have BB&T, I have a number of debt instruments of that sort.
[3:40:38.120 --> 3:40:46.120]  They have, in fact, appreciated from the time you bought till today in various portfolios.
[3:40:46.120 --> 3:40:50.120]  So I'm looking at those and I'm following a lot more of those kinds of instruments.
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:52.120]  They have appreciated.
[3:40:52.120 --> 3:41:03.120]  The question here today, under oath, as someone who should know about this is, are your purchases above par today in your opinion?
[3:41:03.120 --> 3:41:05.120]  Candidly, Congressman, I don't know.
[3:41:05.120 --> 3:41:10.120]  We have independent valuation firms that are going to provide regular reporting on the current value.
[3:41:10.120 --> 3:41:12.120]  Regular reporting starting when? You're here today.
[3:41:12.120 --> 3:41:15.120]  Do you have any regular reporting from the day you bought them till today?
[3:41:15.120 --> 3:41:22.120]  We've published the reports to the Treasury website within 48 hours of completing the transactions on the terms.
[3:41:22.120 --> 3:41:24.120]  Right now, we're in the process.
[3:41:24.120 --> 3:41:30.120]  Just yesterday, the equity asset manager solicitations concluded and we've received, I think, hundreds of proposals.
[3:41:30.120 --> 3:41:38.120]  We'll be engaging the equity asset managers who will be providing us the valuation services and the reporting to the Congress on a go forward basis.
[3:41:38.120 --> 3:41:47.120]  But wouldn't it be reasonable for us to believe here today that if, in fact, you have improved the market, that those assets that you purchase,
[3:41:47.120 --> 3:41:54.120]  we'll call them equities since they're a hybrid, have appreciated?
[3:41:54.120 --> 3:41:57.120]  I think it would be reasonable relative to the day that we bought them.
[3:41:57.120 --> 3:42:03.120]  Okay, so if we find out on the next report, which I hope is forthcoming and we will be looking for it,
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:08.120]  that they are below par, then, in fact, you pay too much, right?
[3:42:08.120 --> 3:42:12.120]  Well, again, it depends, Congressman, what our objective was.
[3:42:12.120 --> 3:42:20.120]  Our objective was to create a program that would encourage thousands of banks across our country to voluntarily apply and to use the capital.
[3:42:20.120 --> 3:42:24.120]  And so we intentionally made it attractive for them to want to apply.
[3:42:24.120 --> 3:42:32.120]  So you believe here today that you had authority to subsidize banks, including providing them this capital at a below par,
[3:42:32.120 --> 3:42:37.120]  a below fair market of a market that should have existed but didn't exist?
[3:42:37.120 --> 3:42:42.120]  Well, Congressman, as you know, the market when we did this was there wasn't a market.
[3:42:42.120 --> 3:42:44.120]  Most banks couldn't raise private capital.
[3:42:44.120 --> 3:42:47.120]  No, no, but we're in a better market today.
[3:42:47.120 --> 3:42:54.120]  You understand, one of the reasons for the question is you've thrown $350 billion, including AIG and so on out there.
[3:42:54.120 --> 3:42:56.120]  You're coming back for another $350 billion.
[3:42:56.120 --> 3:43:03.120]  If, in fact, what we discover, and I believe here today, is that your $350 billion,
[3:43:03.120 --> 3:43:09.120]  and let's just look at $250 billion, we'll leave AIG, which is a whole other can of arms, aside,
[3:43:09.120 --> 3:43:15.120]  if that money, in fact, is a subsidy arriving at a price below the fair market price,
[3:43:15.120 --> 3:43:22.120]  thus causing banks to choose you, including banks in my district, choose you instead of other capital,
[3:43:22.120 --> 3:43:25.120]  all you've really done is give them a discount capital.
[3:43:25.120 --> 3:43:31.120]  Now, the reason I ask that is, how large is the capital base necessary for the banking industry in America?
[3:43:31.120 --> 3:43:33.120]  Do you have any idea?
[3:43:33.120 --> 3:43:37.120]  Isn't it about $55 trillion plus or minus?
[3:43:37.120 --> 3:43:39.120]  In terms of assets or capital?
[3:43:39.120 --> 3:43:41.120]  The size of the market, if you will.
[3:43:41.120 --> 3:43:43.120]  That sounds about right.
[3:43:43.120 --> 3:43:54.120]  Okay, so you'd have to put several trillion dollars in to be the owner, if you will, of that base, even with the multiple.
[3:43:54.120 --> 3:43:58.120]  So the reason I'm asking all this, and I know I've got to yield back my error,
[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:02.120]  I've extended my time and just follow up one last time,
[3:44:02.120 --> 3:44:07.120]  if all you're doing is moving your money in at a discount to banks,
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:16.120]  and entities like American Express and GMAC and everybody else who's rushing to become a bank holding company today as a result of this deal,
[3:44:16.120 --> 3:44:24.120]  then at the end of the day we will have bought stock at too high a price or debt at too low an interest rate,
[3:44:24.120 --> 3:44:26.120]  however you want to look at these preferred instruments,
[3:44:26.120 --> 3:44:32.120]  and we will have moved people to other capital where they can get the returns they want
[3:44:32.120 --> 3:44:36.120]  because you're competing at a price that the market wouldn't accept the loans.
[3:44:36.120 --> 3:44:39.120]  You're giving them a deal that distorts the market.
[3:44:39.120 --> 3:44:41.120]  Isn't that true based on your background at Goldman?
[3:44:41.120 --> 3:44:45.120]  Well, Congressman, when you have a market that is dysfunctional,
[3:44:45.120 --> 3:44:48.120]  any deal that we would put in, because we'd be the only provider of capital,
[3:44:48.120 --> 3:44:52.120]  would by definition be better than the non-available capital in the middle of a crisis.
[3:44:52.120 --> 3:44:56.120]  So yes, we did offer attractive terms to stabilize the market.
[3:44:56.120 --> 3:45:01.120]  Mr. Chairman, I might note that Warren Buffett weighed into this with billions of dollars.
[3:45:01.120 --> 3:45:02.120]  Wells did a deal.
[3:45:02.120 --> 3:45:09.120]  There have been dollars done, but those dollars, I believe, are not coming in until the United States quits
[3:45:09.120 --> 3:45:15.120]  subsidizing in competition to private sector dollars that would ask for a better return,
[3:45:15.120 --> 3:45:22.120]  and undoubtedly would say that dividends and excess compensation would have to be curtailed
[3:45:22.120 --> 3:45:25.120]  until they were getting their returns.
[3:45:25.120 --> 3:45:27.120]  I thank the gentleman.
[3:45:27.120 --> 3:45:35.120]  There was a reason why I voted with the gentleman twice on this same question, the bailout.
[3:45:35.120 --> 3:45:40.120]  We now recognize for a period of 10 minutes Mr. Cummings of Maryland.
[3:45:40.120 --> 3:45:42.120]  Mr. Cummings, you may proceed with your question.
[3:45:42.120 --> 3:45:44.120]  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
[3:45:44.120 --> 3:45:56.120]  Mr. Cush, Kerry, I must say that as I have sat here listening to your answers, I have been disappointed.
[3:45:56.120 --> 3:46:08.120]  I think that you have kind of skipped around the issues here, and I say that because when I saw pictures of you,
[3:46:08.120 --> 3:46:13.120]  I thought, you know, I said, this looks like a guy that will be a straight shooter.
[3:46:13.120 --> 3:46:15.120]  So I'm going to ask you some questions, sir.
[3:46:15.120 --> 3:46:18.120]  And I don't say that trying to embarrass you.
[3:46:18.120 --> 3:46:26.120]  I say it because life is short, and I don't have time to hearing around the rosy answers.
[3:46:26.120 --> 3:46:29.120]  Let me go back to something the Chairman said.
[3:46:29.120 --> 3:46:36.120]  He talked about how, whether you understood that when foreclosures take place,
[3:46:36.120 --> 3:46:44.120]  he said, he asked you, did you realize that it also affects the housing in the communities?
[3:46:44.120 --> 3:46:49.120]  In other words, you sell it for closed houses, lower price, price value goes down.
[3:46:49.120 --> 3:46:52.120]  Let me ask you this follow-up question to that.
[3:46:52.120 --> 3:47:02.120]  You also understand that when price value goes down, local government is affected because it's based upon the tax laws or based upon that.
[3:47:02.120 --> 3:47:04.120]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[3:47:04.120 --> 3:47:10.120]  So it's a very serious problem that we are dealing with here.
[3:47:10.120 --> 3:47:14.120]  And I guess what I'm, I always, every time I sit in these hearings,
[3:47:14.120 --> 3:47:21.120]  I always try to put myself in the position of my constituents who are watching this.
[3:47:21.120 --> 3:47:26.120]  Because when I come home, hopefully I'll get home about three o'clock today,
[3:47:26.120 --> 3:47:28.120]  I live in the inner city of Baltimore.
[3:47:28.120 --> 3:47:35.120]  And believe me, when I go to the supermarket tonight, when I go take my daughter to the movies this evening,
[3:47:35.120 --> 3:47:39.120]  I promise you people are going to ask me about you.
[3:47:39.120 --> 3:47:48.120]  And what they're going to say is, Cummings, we watched the hearing, we heard that guy cash carry,
[3:47:48.120 --> 3:47:52.120]  but I'm losing my house today.
[3:47:52.120 --> 3:47:54.120]  And they're going to ask the question.
[3:47:54.120 --> 3:48:02.120]  They're going to say, well, we heard about the city group thing where I've got to be three months behind before I can get help.
[3:48:02.120 --> 3:48:04.120]  And we heard that guy cash carry.
[3:48:04.120 --> 3:48:06.120]  We know he's in charge of the $700 billion.
[3:48:06.120 --> 3:48:09.120]  What can he tell me today?
[3:48:09.120 --> 3:48:11.120]  I do not want a handout.
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:13.120]  I just want a hand.
[3:48:13.120 --> 3:48:15.120]  I want to pay my mortgage.
[3:48:15.120 --> 3:48:25.120]  I just need a little help because this Bush administration and his policies has put me in a position where I don't have a job.
[3:48:25.120 --> 3:48:29.120]  Or I'm now working a part-time job.
[3:48:29.120 --> 3:48:30.120]  Help me.
[3:48:30.120 --> 3:48:32.120]  Did I miss something Cummings?
[3:48:32.120 --> 3:48:34.120]  What can Mr. Cash Carry?
[3:48:34.120 --> 3:48:40.120]  Did he say something to help me know how I can help my family?
[3:48:40.120 --> 3:48:41.120]  That's what they're asking.
[3:48:41.120 --> 3:48:43.120]  They are in pain.
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:45.120]  Now, I'm giving you your, you're on TV.
[3:48:45.120 --> 3:48:47.120]  You're the man.
[3:48:47.120 --> 3:48:52.120]  I don't know how much we're paying you, but you're our employee.
[3:48:52.120 --> 3:48:58.120]  And I'm asking you to look in the camera, somewhere back here, and tell those people what you are doing.
[3:48:58.120 --> 3:49:02.120]  They hear about the bailouts of Wall Street.
[3:49:02.120 --> 3:49:08.120]  They hear that their tax dollars are being paid to AIG and these people going on these junkets and all that.
[3:49:08.120 --> 3:49:10.120]  They hear all of that.
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:13.120]  But they feel like it's ring around the rosy.
[3:49:13.120 --> 3:49:18.120]  They hear a lot of nice talk, but they're still being put out of their houses.
[3:49:18.120 --> 3:49:29.120]  They hear Paulson get up and talk of all this wonderful stuff, but they still are worried about whether they're going to come home and their stuff is going to, all of their furniture is going to be on the street.
[3:49:29.120 --> 3:49:32.120]  Those are the people that I represent.
[3:49:32.120 --> 3:49:39.120]  So I'm begging you to please tell me exactly what is being done.
[3:49:39.120 --> 3:49:41.120]  And then I want you to do something else.
[3:49:41.120 --> 3:49:47.120]  With Fannie Mae announcing Monday that it had lost 29 billion dollars.
[3:49:47.120 --> 3:49:51.120]  And you talked about all the wonderful things that Fannie Mae is going to do.
[3:49:51.120 --> 3:49:53.120]  I'm wondering how that affects.
[3:49:53.120 --> 3:49:57.120]  I know we got 100 billion that can go into their coffers.
[3:49:57.120 --> 3:50:02.120]  But how does that affect them helping that guy that I just talked about?
[3:50:02.120 --> 3:50:09.120]  And I'm saying, I mean, I hear you guys talk about the urgency of the market and all of that.
[3:50:09.120 --> 3:50:15.120]  But something tells me that you need, and I think this is where the chairman is coming from.
[3:50:15.120 --> 3:50:22.120]  You know, we can fix Wall Street, but it seems like there's a bucket down there at the bottom.
[3:50:22.120 --> 3:50:26.120]  These people that are being thrown out of their houses, it's like a bucket with a hole in it.
[3:50:26.120 --> 3:50:32.120]  So whatever you do for Wall Street, if you're not saving these mortgages and helping people stay afloat,
[3:50:32.120 --> 3:50:37.120]  and by the way, saving some pain, I mean, it makes no sense.
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:43.120]  And so help me with that because my people don't believe that you all care about them.
[3:50:43.120 --> 3:50:46.120]  And I hate to tell you that, but they don't.
[3:50:46.120 --> 3:50:49.120]  And they're angry.
[3:50:49.120 --> 3:50:52.120]  Let me say two things, please.
[3:50:52.120 --> 3:51:00.120]  All right, folks, we just rolled through the breaks for the infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv viewers.
[3:51:00.120 --> 3:51:07.120]  But this will go about a minute or two over when the radio show ends on the Internet only.
[3:51:07.120 --> 3:51:10.120]  We'll finish up the clip with Cassinage.
[3:51:10.120 --> 3:51:14.120]  There's even more I'm going to play tomorrow, and then we'll be able to take your calls on it and comment.
[3:51:14.120 --> 3:51:21.120]  One thing I keep forgetting to plug, prisonplanet.tv, for this month into December,
[3:51:21.120 --> 3:51:25.120]  you can get five months free right now at prisonplanet.tv,
[3:51:25.120 --> 3:51:29.120]  20-plus films that I've made, hundreds of other documentaries,
[3:51:29.120 --> 3:51:33.120]  my weekly TV reports, in-studio reports, extras, just so much.
[3:51:33.120 --> 3:51:36.120]  And it's all in high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:51:36.120 --> 3:51:39.120]  You can then burn it to disk and give it to friends, family, and neighbors.
[3:51:39.120 --> 3:51:41.120]  People are really waking up right now.
[3:51:41.120 --> 3:51:43.120]  They're ready to hear the truth right now.
[3:51:43.120 --> 3:51:49.120]  And prisonplanet.tv is an armory in the fight against the New World Order in the information wars.
[3:51:49.120 --> 3:51:53.120]  So don't forget prisonplanet.tv and give it as a gift.
[3:51:53.120 --> 3:51:55.120]  Give them a prisonplanet.tv membership.
[3:51:55.120 --> 3:52:01.120]  Just create a passcode and a username and then give that to friends and family in a card
[3:52:01.120 --> 3:52:03.120]  and use the passcode for yourself.
[3:52:03.120 --> 3:52:04.120]  That's my little present to you.
[3:52:04.120 --> 3:52:08.120]  You can share the passcode with a couple of folks if you'd like to.
[3:52:08.120 --> 3:52:11.120]  But that said, let's go back to the hearing.
[3:52:11.120 --> 3:52:15.120]  And then when it's over, rebroadcast will start at infowars.com.
[3:52:15.120 --> 3:52:19.120]  With Max Kaiser today, we also had Gerald Salente.
[3:52:19.120 --> 3:52:20.120]  It was amazing on.
[3:52:20.120 --> 3:52:24.120]  So that's all coming up in the refeeds at infowars.com.
[3:52:24.120 --> 3:52:29.120]  But we're going to go out of the show with the clip and into overdrive for the infowars.com.
[3:52:29.120 --> 3:52:31.120]  Listener, here we go.
[3:52:31.120 --> 3:52:33.120]  Let me say two things, please.
[3:52:33.120 --> 3:52:44.120]  One, the legislation that we asked for, we asked for it to try to stabilize and prevent a complete financial collapse of our financial system.
[3:52:44.120 --> 3:52:46.120]  And that was not to help Wall Street.
[3:52:46.120 --> 3:52:48.120]  That was to help every American.
[3:52:48.120 --> 3:52:49.120]  Please, sir.
[3:52:49.120 --> 3:52:51.120]  Let me tell you something.
[3:52:51.120 --> 3:52:52.120]  I understand that.
[3:52:52.120 --> 3:52:53.120]  That's why I voted for it.
[3:52:53.120 --> 3:52:54.120]  Yes, sir.
[3:52:54.120 --> 3:53:00.120]  But let me tell you, when we gave them money, when we gave the banks money, they still weren't loaning any money.
[3:53:00.120 --> 3:53:08.120]  Let's talk about that because we are passionate about getting the banks to loan money in our communities to help our small businesses and to help our homeowners.
[3:53:08.120 --> 3:53:17.120]  First of all, we allocated $250 billion for banks of all sizes across the country, and just about half the money is out the door today.
[3:53:17.120 --> 3:53:21.120]  I think we're going to approve another 20 banks today, large and small across the country.
[3:53:21.120 --> 3:53:28.120]  Potentially thousands of banks are applying, and it's going to take a few months to process the thousands of transactions to get the money out the door.
[3:53:28.120 --> 3:53:30.120]  So we're working as fast as we can.
[3:53:30.120 --> 3:53:35.120]  We're working around the clock to process all these to get the money in our community banks.
[3:53:35.120 --> 3:53:36.120]  It's not a stimulus.
[3:53:36.120 --> 3:53:39.120]  It's not an economic growth plan.
[3:53:39.120 --> 3:53:43.120]  It is an economic stabilization plan to stabilize the financial system.
[3:53:43.120 --> 3:53:50.120]  And so I just want to respectfully set expectations that we are trying to use these resources to stabilize the system for every American.
[3:53:50.120 --> 3:53:54.120]  But we also have real economic challenges that we all need to work through.
[3:53:54.120 --> 3:54:07.120]  Mr. Kashkari, in the neighborhood I grew up in, in inner city of Baltimore, one of the things that you tried to do was make sure that you were not considered a chump.
[3:54:07.120 --> 3:54:18.120]  And what chump meant was that you didn't want people to see you as just somebody they could get over on.
[3:54:18.120 --> 3:54:45.120]  And I'm just wondering how you feel about an AIG giving $503 million worth of bonuses out of one hand and accepting $154 billion from hard-working taxpayers.
[3:54:45.120 --> 3:54:49.120]  You know, because I'm trying to get, I'm trying to make sure you get it.
[3:54:49.120 --> 3:55:07.120]  You know, I mean, and you know what, what really bothers me is because all these other people who are lined up, they say, well, is Kashkari a chump?
[3:55:07.120 --> 3:55:09.120]  We can just go in there and I'm not saying they are.
[3:55:09.120 --> 3:55:11.120]  I don't know.
[3:55:11.120 --> 3:55:13.120]  We can go in there.
[3:55:13.120 --> 3:55:15.120]  We'll get some money.
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:17.120]  And you know what AIG did?
[3:55:17.120 --> 3:55:21.120]  They even will tell you they're coming back for some more.
[3:55:21.120 --> 3:55:33.120]  And they have the nerve, the nerve to grant some $503 million worth of bonuses.
[3:55:33.120 --> 3:55:52.120]  I'm just wondering, do you all say, say to yourself, boy, this doesn't look too good. And I'm wondering about them, if it was Sikri from a PR standpoint, and I know nothing about PR, but one thing I do know, I wouldn't want to be asking my friend for some money to help me stay afloat.
[3:55:52.120 --> 3:56:10.120]  And if I didn't get the money, I'd be out of business. And then for my friend, I say, okay, I'm really struggling. Then my friend, who can barely afford to go to McDonald's, then walks around and sees me in a restaurant costing $150 a meal.
[3:56:10.120 --> 3:56:12.120]  There's absolutely something wrong with that picture.
[3:56:12.120 --> 3:56:20.120]  And so I wonder, do you all, I mean, does that go through your head? Or is it just me? Am I missing something?
[3:56:20.120 --> 3:56:27.120]  No, Congressman, I saw the same images that you saw of the parties, and I share your frustration with that.
[3:56:27.120 --> 3:56:31.120]  What about the $503 million worth of bonuses?
[3:56:31.120 --> 3:56:38.120]  Let's talk about that, because I heard about that this morning, I think, as you did in the paper. And I asked my colleagues to check on it and say, what is this?
[3:56:38.120 --> 3:56:40.120]  Because I was outraged when I saw the headlines.
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:54.120]  What was explained to me is that this was money, apparently, and I'm not defending it, but this is money that had already been paid to employees that was set aside in a separate fund that they would get if they left AIG.
[3:56:54.120 --> 3:57:00.120]  And we need AIG to keep running as a company so that it can sell off its assets and pay back the taxpayers.
[3:57:00.120 --> 3:57:11.120]  And so from what's been explained to me is that this money that had already been paid but set aside to the employees was now released so that the employees did not have an incentive to quit.
[3:57:11.120 --> 3:57:16.120]  Because we need them to keep working so that they can sell off the assets and pay back the taxpayers.
[3:57:16.120 --> 3:57:25.120]  We need them to keep working, but guess what? There are a whole lot of people that can replace them because there are so many people losing their jobs.
[3:57:25.120 --> 3:57:27.120]  This is an employer's market today.
[3:57:27.120 --> 3:57:28.120]  That's true, sir.
[3:57:28.120 --> 3:57:37.120]  Come on now. I guarantee you there are people who are lined up saying, please quit so I can get a job.
[3:57:37.120 --> 3:57:53.120]  If I may take the prerogative as chair to say, I don't think anyone questions Mr. Kashkari that you're working hard. Our question is who you're working for.
[3:57:53.120 --> 3:58:04.120]  All right, folks. That is it for this transmission. Again, rebroadcast starts now with Gerald Solente, Max Kaiser and many others on the internet at infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[3:58:04.120 --> 3:58:13.120]  On those exclusive streams, we'll be back on the AM and FM dial on stations as they rear across the country and back live tomorrow 11am to 3pm with other big guests, your calls and important news.
[3:58:13.120 --> 3:58:25.120]  I'm Alex Jones, signing off. Great job with the crew and the sponsors. The resistance will continue.
