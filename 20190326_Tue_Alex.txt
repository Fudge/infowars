[00:00.000 --> 00:29.920]  Well, if you want next year's news today, this is the
[00:29.920 --> 00:34.200]  place where the globalists are desperate to shut down that
[00:34.200 --> 00:38.880]  are desperate and working around the clock to try to shut
[00:38.880 --> 00:43.840]  down. Thank you so much for joining us on this live Tuesday,
[00:43.840 --> 00:48.480]  the 26th day of March, 2019. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Let's
[00:48.480 --> 00:54.160]  get right down to business. Jesse Smollett allowed to walk.
[00:55.440 --> 00:58.560]  That's right, caught red handed. The police have the guys that
[00:58.560 --> 01:01.040]  staged it. They have the receipts. They have the
[01:01.040 --> 01:05.920]  surveillance footage at both the stores. They have everything.
[01:07.280 --> 01:12.040]  But the head prosecutor that's already under federal
[01:12.040 --> 01:17.760]  investigation says he's done such work for the community race
[01:17.760 --> 01:25.360]  warring that he goes free, free, free. It's just too embarrassing
[01:25.360 --> 01:30.320]  to have the trial. Too embarrassing because Barack Hussein
[01:30.320 --> 01:36.960]  Obama is involved. Oh, I've got a clip coming up where Clapper,
[01:37.520 --> 01:40.840]  former head of national intelligence was on CNN, where
[01:40.840 --> 01:43.480]  Trump and others are talking about criminal charges against
[01:43.480 --> 01:47.880]  him. And he says there'll be no criminal charges against me. I
[01:47.880 --> 01:53.440]  acted under orders from El Presidente, which we told you a
[01:53.440 --> 02:00.760]  long, long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. Directed
[02:00.760 --> 02:03.720]  by Obama, directed by Hillary from inside the White House
[02:03.720 --> 02:08.080]  during the campaign. And of course, it's come out that
[02:08.080 --> 02:11.800]  that's exactly what happened. You don't just think Clapper and
[02:11.800 --> 02:20.040]  Brennan and Comey and everybody else just magically did all
[02:20.040 --> 02:23.720]  this by themselves on their own. You don't just think
[02:23.720 --> 02:30.440]  struck in page and or and McCabe and all and the whole MSM
[02:30.480 --> 02:33.160]  with total confidence, all the late night comedy shows, every
[02:33.160 --> 02:37.360]  news program is everywhere. Russian agents have taken over
[02:37.480 --> 02:45.200]  Red Alert, air raid sirens marching feet, stomping boots,
[02:45.200 --> 02:49.680]  dogs barking. I mean, we've got to do something. The Russians
[02:49.680 --> 02:51.960]  are coming. The Russians are coming. They're already in
[02:51.960 --> 02:58.680]  control. Total fiction, total fraud, directed by the White
[02:58.680 --> 03:04.960]  House, directed by the whole shooting match. And now that
[03:04.960 --> 03:08.360]  it's coming out, Clapper and Brennan and all of them are
[03:08.360 --> 03:12.480]  making the rounds on TV saying, I did it under orders of
[03:12.480 --> 03:16.760]  Obama. And then he reads off or play the clip coming up. He
[03:16.760 --> 03:20.920]  reads off all the dates that they planted it in the news, but
[03:20.920 --> 03:24.520]  gave it no attention that they were surveilling Trump and that
[03:24.520 --> 03:27.000]  they were spying on him. That's how we knew they were. And I
[03:27.000 --> 03:30.040]  said, look, they put it there to hide it in plain view. So their
[03:30.040 --> 03:32.400]  own operas would think it must be legitimate. It's in the
[03:32.400 --> 03:35.480]  newspaper. But then once I pointed it out, once Trump got
[03:35.480 --> 03:38.080]  elected and got into office, they went, that's insane. Joan
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.240]  says he got it from the New York Times. He made it up. Remember
[03:42.240 --> 03:46.600]  Anderson Cooper? Have the New York Times guy on? See, I know
[03:46.600 --> 03:49.240]  how they work folks. They had to have it in the newspapers. So
[03:49.240 --> 03:52.120]  their own people would go, we're gonna spy on all of them and
[03:52.120 --> 03:55.320]  we're gonna set them up. Okay, I guess it's in the newspaper.
[03:55.320 --> 03:59.400]  I'm gonna do it. Love to have what has just magically known
[03:59.400 --> 04:06.520]  all this. I didn't. They hit it in plain view in front of
[04:06.520 --> 04:10.200]  everyone like we're complete morons. But here's the good
[04:10.200 --> 04:13.800]  news. It got almost no attention in the talk with Netanyahu and
[04:13.800 --> 04:17.880]  Trump in the Oval Office yesterday when Trump said this is
[04:17.880 --> 04:22.360]  treason. And it is treason. And now he's been tweeting saying
[04:22.360 --> 04:26.360]  Obama administration must account for abuse of surveillance
[04:26.360 --> 04:30.280]  power. And what have we been saying day one? It's like Nixon
[04:30.280 --> 04:32.680]  got in trouble for some illegal spying that is dwarfed by
[04:32.680 --> 04:36.360]  this. Still, it was badly dead. This is thousands and
[04:36.360 --> 04:40.040]  thousands and thousands of times bigger. And this will get
[04:40.040 --> 04:45.160]  them in a lot of trouble. But Jesse Small and Info is coming
[04:45.160 --> 04:48.440]  up as well. Things are not going to be boring around here.
[04:48.440 --> 04:52.120]  This is one broadcast you don't want to miss and please on my
[04:52.120 --> 04:55.560]  knighted knee. I ask you to remember only you can break the
[04:55.560 --> 05:00.200]  back of the sensors. Only you can spread those links.
[05:00.200 --> 05:03.160]  infowarestore.com is how you support us and it's not like
[05:03.160 --> 05:06.280]  we're selling stuff you don't need. You don't want the air in
[05:06.280 --> 05:10.520]  the average American home is filled with toxins that put it
[05:10.520 --> 05:14.440]  on par with a major city. There's some of the most
[05:14.440 --> 05:17.720]  polluted areas on earth are major cities. How can I solve
[05:17.720 --> 05:21.560]  that problem? So we have air filters at infowarestore.com,
[05:21.560 --> 05:27.240]  the Alexa Pure Breeze, which is right now $50 off the
[05:27.240 --> 05:31.240]  Alexa Pure Breeze groundbreaking iron cluster air filter
[05:31.240 --> 05:34.920]  technology. And we've got a limited quantity of these left
[05:34.920 --> 05:37.480]  right now. We're basically selling these at cost because
[05:37.480 --> 05:41.080]  there was a big overhaul. Go ahead and read the hundreds of
[05:41.080 --> 05:45.400]  five-star reviews for yourself. I've got two in my home. You
[05:45.400 --> 05:48.840]  will notice the difference, ladies and gentlemen, with the
[05:48.840 --> 05:54.200]  Alexa Pure Breeze in your house. Don't live in a polluted
[05:54.200 --> 06:07.480]  major city in your home. Have clean air. Go to infowarstore.com.
[06:07.480 --> 06:12.680]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones
[06:12.680 --> 06:16.520]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[06:16.520 --> 06:19.240]  Here's some of the giant breaking news dark day for the
[06:19.240 --> 06:22.920]  internet link tax. EU lawmakers approve controversial
[06:22.920 --> 06:27.240]  copyright reform saying even linking to someone's website
[06:27.240 --> 06:31.000]  is illegal. You're like, what? Oh, yes, they're going to
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.240]  destroy the internet. The globalist fear it.
[06:35.240 --> 06:38.280]  New York County declares measles emergency. A New York
[06:38.280 --> 06:40.600]  County that are shipping massive amounts of illegal aliens
[06:40.600 --> 06:45.480]  into bans anyone under 18 who isn't vaccinated from public
[06:45.480 --> 06:50.040]  places. And there's a total hysteria being launched across
[06:50.040 --> 06:54.280]  the West. If you're not vaccinated, you're a criminal.
[06:54.280 --> 06:59.080]  But never any discussion of the bringing in people with TB
[06:59.080 --> 07:02.840]  drug resistant diseases of all different types in mass
[07:02.840 --> 07:06.760]  and explosions and all these diseases that weren't even
[07:06.760 --> 07:09.320]  known in this country anymore. There's no discussion of why
[07:09.320 --> 07:12.840]  that why this is happening in New York and in Los Angeles
[07:12.840 --> 07:17.720]  and Miami and Houston, Texas. There's no discussion of why
[07:17.720 --> 07:20.280]  but if you actually go to local news, they'll admit that it's
[07:20.280 --> 07:26.760]  the illegal aliens that are spreading it. Absolutely insane.
[07:26.760 --> 07:29.640]  And then, of course, the big story of looking at drugreport.com
[07:29.640 --> 07:33.720]  Empire bombshells, small it charges dropped,
[07:33.720 --> 07:38.600]  star sticks to story. He was attacked. Community service
[07:38.600 --> 07:43.480]  case sealed. Chicago police furious. What did I tell you a
[07:43.480 --> 07:47.640]  month ago here on air? The articles posted on info wars.com.
[07:47.640 --> 07:56.280]  Federal probe launched into Obama AIDS involved in staging
[07:56.280 --> 08:01.720]  the small it case as well as empire executives who wanted to
[08:01.720 --> 08:06.120]  revamp and relaunch the flagging program. There's one of the
[08:06.120 --> 08:12.280]  articles February 22nd. It's now March 26th. The Alex Jones
[08:12.280 --> 08:16.120]  show. Feds investigating whether dims Fox directed small it
[08:16.120 --> 08:20.600]  and then it goes into the article.
[08:20.600 --> 08:24.520]  Obama being involved with Obama AIDS in Chicago and protecting him
[08:24.520 --> 08:32.040]  and now I have page six Chicago Tribune right here.
[08:32.040 --> 08:37.160]  This week cops call for federal probe related to Obama aid involvement
[08:37.160 --> 08:43.080]  in Jesse Smollett case. That's right. Cops call for federal probe
[08:43.080 --> 08:48.440]  related to Obama aid involvement because she's the head
[08:48.440 --> 08:54.840]  Cook County attorney whose big buddies with Jesse Smollett
[08:54.840 --> 09:01.640]  and big buddies with Obama. Kim Fox who worked for Obama.
[09:01.640 --> 09:06.440]  And she's the one under investigation and she's the one
[09:06.440 --> 09:09.960]  that got the judge to say Smollett can pay 10,000
[09:09.960 --> 09:16.440]  greenbacks and fly free and admit no harm. You just had 40
[09:16.440 --> 09:19.560]  detectives working around the clock. You just tried to cause a race war. You
[09:19.560 --> 09:23.160]  did it because you wanted to create racial division and get more money.
[09:23.160 --> 09:26.680]  You guys are in a giant fiasco fraud and that's
[09:26.680 --> 09:32.760]  okay because you're in Chicago Chicago. Oh yeah.
[09:32.760 --> 09:38.520]  What a joke. Talk about Third World baby. This is his Third World
[09:38.520 --> 09:44.920]  dictatorship as it gets but they they counted the cost.
[09:44.920 --> 09:49.720]  If they put him in front of a jury and he kept lying and they showed all the
[09:49.720 --> 09:53.880]  surveillance footage and there's high witnesses that both work for him
[09:53.880 --> 10:00.040]  both as extras on empire it would have been even more destructive.
[10:00.040 --> 10:03.400]  And so because he's too corrupt to fail it's too embarrassing
[10:03.400 --> 10:07.160]  because he's got friends in high places like Barack Hussein Obama
[10:07.160 --> 10:10.920]  who you know is involved in the whole thing.
[10:10.920 --> 10:13.720]  The way the whole media jumped on it the way they all defended the improbable
[10:13.720 --> 10:19.080]  story and now we see that as a microcosm.
[10:19.080 --> 10:24.200]  We pull back to the 35,000 foot level
[10:24.200 --> 10:30.040]  and what is Brennan and Clapper and others doing and press releases and on tv.
[10:30.040 --> 10:35.400]  Next segment I'll play the clip. What are they saying?
[10:35.400 --> 10:39.000]  They're saying I was directed by Obama to open up the Russiagate
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.040]  investigation. They're doing illegal wiretapping
[10:42.040 --> 10:45.160]  into everything they did and then once the president's already in
[10:45.160 --> 10:48.200]  office and they testify to congress and talk to the president
[10:48.200 --> 10:52.360]  Clapper and Comey and Brennan all tell him oh you're not the subject of the
[10:52.360 --> 10:56.840]  investigation sir lying because he was the subject that's
[10:56.840 --> 11:01.720]  perjury to congress. You see they thought they were
[11:01.720 --> 11:06.760]  going to win this thing. They didn't but now we learn why they
[11:06.760 --> 11:12.360]  think they're going to get away with it. Obama, Hillary were both
[11:12.360 --> 11:17.560]  co-presidents for eight years. She was co-president
[11:17.560 --> 11:22.120]  and they did whatever they wanted to and so when Trump looked like he was going
[11:22.120 --> 11:24.440]  to win and got the nomination they started the fake
[11:24.440 --> 11:28.360]  Russiagate investigation to cover all their illegal wiretaps
[11:28.360 --> 11:31.880]  they already had going on the surveillance and then they expanded
[11:31.880 --> 11:35.800]  and they expanded again right into the election
[11:35.800 --> 11:40.440]  of Trump. President-elect continued the spying and continued it right on
[11:40.440 --> 11:44.920]  until now. There's rogue agencies, rogue groups doing this but there's nothing
[11:44.920 --> 11:50.040]  there, exonerated, no obstruction, no nothing.
[11:50.040 --> 11:54.680]  But because these crimes are so massive by the other side of the illegal
[11:54.680 --> 11:57.320]  investigation because they have real Russia connections and real China
[11:57.320 --> 12:00.600]  connections now they're going to lean back on executive privilege
[12:00.600 --> 12:05.160]  and say well Obama told us to which they've now done and remember we told
[12:05.160 --> 12:08.680]  you Obama and Hillary ran it. That's now all confirmed. In fact
[12:08.680 --> 12:12.440]  there's a clip that one of our great researchers
[12:12.440 --> 12:15.800]  has found that we'll play first when we come back.
[12:15.800 --> 12:20.040]  Matt found this. Alex Jones calls out treason by deep state and media
[12:20.040 --> 12:28.120]  to launch special counsel on June 8, 2017, 332.
[12:28.120 --> 12:31.480]  That's how long that is and we've got Trump yesterday Mueller report
[12:31.480 --> 12:36.120]  based on treason.
[12:36.200 --> 12:39.480]  And so you will get the news of two years from now
[12:39.480 --> 12:45.560]  today all coming up and then we've got the news I really need to
[12:45.560 --> 12:50.360]  hit more. I covered this yesterday. Teens aren't socializing in the real world
[12:50.360 --> 12:55.880]  and that's making them lonely, depressed, and stupid. Your phone might be
[12:55.880 --> 12:58.760]  messing with your sleep, work, and relationship.
[12:58.760 --> 13:03.080]  Slay the smartphones. Tech conference. It's making our lives more sluggish,
[13:03.080 --> 13:05.720]  study finds.
[13:06.040 --> 13:10.760]  We're going to be talking about that as well and quality of life
[13:10.760 --> 13:16.040]  but there is just so much to get to here today and then an excellent article
[13:16.040 --> 13:21.480]  up on infowars.com and newswars.com from the great Mike Adams.
[13:21.480 --> 13:25.320]  President Trump can end big tech treasonous censorship with a single
[13:25.320 --> 13:29.640]  signature. Here's how and he's absolutely right.
[13:29.640 --> 13:36.360]  That's coming up and remember Avi Yemeni the popular Jewish Australian
[13:36.360 --> 13:39.560]  who's just a mainline conservative. They added it to him to make it look like he
[13:39.560 --> 13:42.600]  supported white supremacists on Jim Jeffery's show.
[13:42.600 --> 13:46.920]  He recorded it all secretly to show that Jim Jeffery set him up and lied.
[13:46.920 --> 13:50.040]  Facebook deleted his account permanently for exposing
[13:50.040 --> 13:54.520]  the criminal activity. Doesn't matter. It's backfired even more.
[13:54.520 --> 14:00.120]  Strize and affect. It's incredible what these crooks do.
[14:00.120 --> 14:04.200]  That article is up on infowars.com with that video
[14:04.200 --> 14:10.120]  as well. The latest. Please do not forget we have
[14:10.120 --> 14:13.400]  sustained under the total enemy attack of Soros, the Clintons, and their crime
[14:13.400 --> 14:16.440]  syndicate. They're losing control. They're
[14:16.440 --> 14:19.400]  failing on a global scale but they're striking back.
[14:19.400 --> 14:23.160]  We've got to hold the line and that means financial support
[14:23.160 --> 14:27.240]  and you've done a great job but we make it easy. Rainforest Plus is an amazing
[14:27.240 --> 14:30.120]  neutropic. We've never had it at 60% off but I

[14:58.280 --> 15:02.280]  shrinking of telomeres. This is all facts. DNA Force is amazing. Go read
[15:02.280 --> 15:04.840]  about it. Leading competitors are $300-400.

[17:28.440 --> 17:34.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[17:34.840 --> 17:37.880]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:37.880 --> 17:43.720]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:43.720 --> 17:47.560]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.560 --> 17:53.080]  Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I.
[17:53.080 --> 17:59.640]  The United States of Empire by James Dunne, available at Amazon Books.

[19:41.640 --> 19:43.080]  without getting a big weight put on your back.
[19:43.080 --> 19:45.320]  And I mean, I don't know what's going to happen to me in the future.
[19:45.320 --> 19:48.920]  I mean, all I know is I want to go with the master built.
[19:48.920 --> 19:53.400]  I want to go to the next level. I want to be with the spirit that I've experienced,
[19:53.400 --> 19:57.400]  not these devil worshipers. They're cold and failed and feels like being a tomb.
[19:57.400 --> 20:03.240]  I want life. I want Jesus.
[20:03.240 --> 20:13.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:19.960 --> 20:22.440]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.
[20:22.440 --> 20:29.560]  The band for Boat and Broadcast is live.
[20:29.560 --> 20:34.120]  It's the Alex Jones show with yours truly. Alex Jones.
[20:34.120 --> 20:37.480]  And people walk with me every day on the street, every day, and they go,
[20:37.480 --> 20:42.680]  I don't know, it's 50 times that I'm like on vacation walking around the beach.
[20:42.680 --> 20:46.520]  Literally. I used to love your show on YouTube.
[20:46.520 --> 20:50.200]  I used to love it on iTunes. Where can I find it?
[20:50.200 --> 20:55.800]  And I go, did you listen very often? infowars.com, video, audio streams,
[20:55.800 --> 20:58.520]  David Knight show, the war room, Owen Schreuer.
[20:59.800 --> 21:02.600]  They go, oh, yeah. And I'm like, yeah.
[21:04.680 --> 21:06.840]  Think about it and then spread the word.
[21:07.880 --> 21:10.280]  But people get habituated listening a certain way.
[21:10.840 --> 21:15.880]  People either listen to books on tape at a certain website or they listen on iTunes
[21:15.880 --> 21:18.440]  or they watch on YouTube. That's how people do things.
[21:18.440 --> 21:20.520]  They tend to do things on one or two mediums.
[21:22.600 --> 21:29.400]  And everyone's been trained to only go to that one big platform like Facebook or Twitter.
[21:30.200 --> 21:37.720]  No, ladies and gentlemen, I started out on talk radio before I ever had a website
[21:38.440 --> 21:42.280]  before I was ever on YouTube and around almost 25 years.
[21:42.280 --> 21:45.640]  And I know the core audience understands that our core audience is bigger than ever,
[21:45.640 --> 21:50.280]  but our outreach to new people has been cut off to a great extent.
[21:50.920 --> 21:54.520]  Where we can actually get real timely information to them like we're about to do.
[21:54.520 --> 21:58.120]  And that's where your ambassadors, that's where your foot soldiers,
[21:58.120 --> 22:00.360]  that's where your captains, that's where your generals,
[22:00.360 --> 22:05.880]  it's where you're the chiefs and where you're just the regular Indians in this fight.
[22:05.880 --> 22:10.360]  We're all in it together and it's never been easier to get people to tune in.
[22:10.360 --> 22:12.040]  You say, you've heard Alex Jones demonize.
[22:12.040 --> 22:13.640]  You've heard out what a bad person he is.
[22:13.640 --> 22:17.160]  You see him in the newspaper all the time with these out of context quotes.
[22:17.160 --> 22:20.920]  Why don't you go see what it is he's actually saying
[22:20.920 --> 22:25.160]  that the globalist are saying is so incredibly bad and so incredibly evil.
[22:26.280 --> 22:27.320]  Now I want to slow down here.
[22:28.760 --> 22:31.320]  Next segment, I'm going to get to the meat and potato facts
[22:31.320 --> 22:37.000]  that Jesse Smollett was allowed to walk today when he was caught totally open and shut case,
[22:37.000 --> 22:44.920]  red handed prima facie running a giant scam staging a false flag.
[22:45.640 --> 22:46.680]  Why is that happening?
[22:48.840 --> 22:55.080]  It's happening because Obama and the Democrats out of Chicago were involved in this along with
[22:55.080 --> 22:57.880]  the individual's running empire.
[22:58.680 --> 23:03.400]  Now I said that a month ago and now you learn there are federal investigations.
[23:03.400 --> 23:10.120]  There are calls for other federal investigations into Kim Fox and Tina chin
[23:11.560 --> 23:15.640]  who both have worked with Obama and one of them was Obama's direct lawyer.
[23:17.720 --> 23:19.080]  So you've got open and shut.
[23:19.960 --> 23:20.680]  That's coming up.
[23:22.920 --> 23:25.720]  Next segment, what I'm going to get to right now.
[23:25.720 --> 23:36.040]  What I'm going to get to right now is the open and shut facts.
[23:37.960 --> 23:44.840]  110% that Obama allowed spying on Trump during the campaign when he was president
[23:44.840 --> 23:47.480]  elect and after and that it's outrageous crimes.
[23:47.480 --> 23:55.800]  And now clapper and Brennan have come out because there's calls for them to be criminally charged.
[23:55.800 --> 23:59.720]  They've said no, we were under orders from the president.
[24:00.600 --> 24:02.600]  That clip will be at the start of the next segment.
[24:03.480 --> 24:11.320]  But first let's go to the president yesterday with Benjamin yet in Yahoo laying out.
[24:11.320 --> 24:12.600]  What's really happened here it is.
[24:12.600 --> 24:17.160]  Mr. President, so did this turn out to not be a witch hunt after all?
[24:18.920 --> 24:20.120]  It's lasted a long time.
[24:20.120 --> 24:21.480]  We're glad it's over.
[24:21.480 --> 24:24.920]  It's 100% the way it should have been.
[24:24.920 --> 24:27.160]  I wish you could have gone a lot sooner, a lot quicker.
[24:27.960 --> 24:31.960]  There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things,
[24:31.960 --> 24:32.840]  very bad things.
[24:32.840 --> 24:35.800]  I would say treasonous things against our country.
[24:35.800 --> 24:44.840]  And hopefully that people that have done such harm to our country,
[24:44.840 --> 24:49.480]  we've gone through a period of really bad things happening.
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.960]  Those people will certainly be looked at.
[24:53.960 --> 24:58.040]  I have been looking at them for a long time and I'm saying why haven't they been looked at?
[24:58.040 --> 24:59.080]  They lied to Congress.
[24:59.640 --> 25:00.920]  Many of them, you know who they are.
[25:02.200 --> 25:03.880]  They've done so many evil things.
[25:03.880 --> 25:05.880]  I will tell you, I love this country.
[25:05.880 --> 25:09.880]  I love this country as much as I can love anything.
[25:09.880 --> 25:11.880]  My family, my country, my God.
[25:11.880 --> 25:15.880]  But what they did, it was a false narrative.
[25:15.880 --> 25:17.880]  It was a terrible thing.
[25:19.880 --> 25:22.920]  We can never let this happen to another president again.
[25:22.920 --> 25:23.880]  I can tell you that.
[25:23.880 --> 25:24.920]  I say it very strongly.
[25:26.920 --> 25:28.920]  Very few people I know could have handled it.
[25:28.920 --> 25:34.920]  We can never, ever let this happen to another president again.
[25:34.920 --> 25:36.920]  Thank you all very much.
[25:36.920 --> 25:36.920]  All right.
[25:36.920 --> 25:44.920]  Now here I am in June 8th, 2017, laying out exactly what you just heard in 2019.
[25:46.920 --> 25:48.920]  This is beyond a nothing burger.
[25:50.920 --> 25:54.920]  This is a treason burger, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:54.920 --> 26:04.920]  Comey admits he leaked the memo to the New York Times, which they did admit got the story wrong.
[26:04.920 --> 26:08.920]  Oh, so they used a memo misrepresented what was in it to hurt the president.
[26:08.920 --> 26:10.920]  That's what I told you day one.
[26:10.920 --> 26:14.920]  Then he wouldn't give the memo to Congress.
[26:14.920 --> 26:18.920]  So he admits he gave this memo to a friend in the press.
[26:18.920 --> 26:26.920]  And now CNN has had to admit fake news about coming testimony and, of course, issued a retraction.
[26:26.920 --> 26:28.920]  CNN issues correction.
[26:28.920 --> 26:32.920]  Headline changes following testimony.
[26:32.920 --> 26:34.920]  Sorry for the fake news.
[26:34.920 --> 26:38.920]  I mean, this is just mind blowing.
[26:38.920 --> 26:40.920]  But my head's spinning right now.
[26:40.920 --> 26:42.920]  This is so many things.
[26:42.920 --> 26:44.920]  This is Comey admitting he put out the memo.
[26:44.920 --> 26:50.920]  Comey then admits that the New York Times got the story completely wrong from the memo.
[26:50.920 --> 26:58.920]  So he commits a crime with a memo that he leaked to the press that they then misrepresent, which we know it was meant to do.
[26:58.920 --> 27:10.920]  Because that memo, the way the New York Times reported it and the way the Washington Post reported it, completely and totally contradicted his testimony on May 3rd, two months later.
[27:10.920 --> 27:16.920]  So now he's got to come back and clean all this up, but it gets worse.
[27:16.920 --> 27:24.920]  He then tells multiple senators that no one tried to influence him on Russia.
[27:24.920 --> 27:31.920]  But through his surrogates that he's leaked to, he said that they did try to influence Russia on the Russia.
[27:31.920 --> 27:35.920]  All Comey now says he felt influenced on was leave Flynn alone.
[27:35.920 --> 27:37.920]  He's a good guy.
[27:37.920 --> 27:40.920]  If you can see it through to not go after him, that's not ordering him.
[27:40.920 --> 27:42.920]  So that's a lie too.
[27:42.920 --> 27:47.920]  All of this is a bunch of lawyers trying to spin and confuse and manipulate the public.
[27:47.920 --> 27:49.920]  That's exactly what it is.
[27:49.920 --> 27:51.920]  The takeaway is none of it's real.
[27:51.920 --> 27:54.920]  It's all fake from pillar to post.
[27:54.920 --> 28:01.920]  Then they've got other clips dealing with the Russia dossier, Piscate, all of it admitting that's all fake now.
[28:01.920 --> 28:09.920]  But remember Buzzfeed and all the rest of them and Daily Beast coming out and saying I had edited a tape of Comey.
[28:09.920 --> 28:15.920]  When he's asked if anybody's tried to influence him, the attorney general or anybody, he says no, no one has.
[28:15.920 --> 28:18.920]  That means no one has because it'd be a pretty big deal.
[28:18.920 --> 28:21.920]  They then spun it that that didn't mean the president.
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.920]  But then today, Senator Burr's talking to him and he says specifically the president didn't.
[28:26.920 --> 28:30.920]  So we're real, Buzzfeed and the Daily Beast, you're fake.
[28:30.920 --> 28:32.920]  And CNN has to admit they're fake.
[28:32.920 --> 28:35.920]  We were right again, specifically.
[28:35.920 --> 28:36.920]  Let's stay right there, folks.
[28:36.920 --> 28:39.920]  And again, all their hoaxes have fallen.
[28:39.920 --> 28:52.920]  Smollett, Stormy Daniels, Malazi Ford, the Russia gate, the carbon taxes, the global warming, all of it's a fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:52.920 --> 28:54.920]  That's what these people are.
[28:54.920 --> 28:56.920]  Stay with us for the right back.
[28:56.920 --> 29:03.920]  Number one international bestselling author, Matthew David Hurtado's pain was simple.

[30:45.920 --> 30:48.920]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[30:48.920 --> 30:51.920]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together.
[30:51.920 --> 30:53.920]  With God's help, we are unstoppable.

[32:51.920 --> 32:55.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[32:55.920 --> 33:22.920]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[33:22.920 --> 33:27.920]  Alright, I'm going to finish up on the first tranche, the first quadrant, the first section,
[33:27.920 --> 33:35.920]  the first zone of this incredible implosion of the attempted takedown of the 45th president
[33:35.920 --> 33:38.920]  and the election of 2016.
[33:38.920 --> 33:39.920]  A coup.
[33:39.920 --> 33:43.920]  You just saw an administrative, deep state, bureaucratic coup.
[33:43.920 --> 33:50.920]  Unravel, derail, spell off the edge of a cliff and then explode.
[33:50.920 --> 33:57.920]  And then now there's all the toxic smoke in the air and fires spreading from the aftermath
[33:57.920 --> 33:59.920]  and this is far from over.
[33:59.920 --> 34:01.920]  This is just beginning.
[34:01.920 --> 34:06.920]  When CNN said, this is the end of the beginning, they meant it.
[34:06.920 --> 34:08.920]  They're not going to stop.
[34:08.920 --> 34:13.920]  They're going to let Jesse Smollett walk to encourage other people to stage events.
[34:13.920 --> 34:18.920]  I always remember General Parton would say,
[34:18.920 --> 34:21.920]  it's communist to always let their people walk.
[34:21.920 --> 34:23.920]  So when there's a communist revolution,
[34:23.920 --> 34:26.920]  all the ones that have been locked up in prison know they're going to be released
[34:26.920 --> 34:30.920]  or those that get busted during a revolution won't even be charged
[34:30.920 --> 34:32.920]  or the charges will be dropped and he said,
[34:32.920 --> 34:35.920]  you'll know you're in a communist revolution when they're committing crimes
[34:35.920 --> 34:38.920]  and the charges are being dropped.
[34:38.920 --> 34:40.920]  Man, he was a smart guy.
[34:40.920 --> 34:45.920]  I knew he was smart, but now I realize how smart.
[34:45.920 --> 34:49.920]  I had dinner with him six or seven times, had him on the air probably a hundred times,
[34:49.920 --> 34:52.920]  spoke a couple of speeches with him, but he would go,
[34:52.920 --> 34:56.920]  listen to me, Jones, it's a program, it's an operation.
[34:56.920 --> 34:59.920]  And if you just know their operations manual, you can defeat them.
[34:59.920 --> 35:02.920]  Stop trying to speculate in all these different corners and areas.
[35:02.920 --> 35:04.920]  They've got a program.
[35:04.920 --> 35:06.920]  They've got a program.
[35:06.920 --> 35:09.920]  It's pretty calm on air, but at dinner, he would, he would, you know,
[35:09.920 --> 35:11.920]  just try to get me on the straight and narrow of like,
[35:11.920 --> 35:13.920]  you don't need to figure out every damn angle.
[35:13.920 --> 35:16.920]  You, they've got a program. They follow it.
[35:16.920 --> 35:20.920]  You want to defeat them, learn the program.
[35:20.920 --> 35:22.920]  And now I know that same frustration.
[35:22.920 --> 35:26.920]  It's a program. It's an operation. It's how they do it.
[35:26.920 --> 35:30.920]  Getting chills right now.
[35:30.920 --> 35:33.920]  See, I said, I'd get into the Russia stuff and I'd get into the Smollett thing
[35:33.920 --> 35:37.920]  and it makes me so angry because if these people can get away
[35:37.920 --> 35:42.920]  with this type of crap where they have Smollett cut and dried
[35:42.920 --> 35:46.920]  at every stage, like if you were writing a college course for criminology
[35:46.920 --> 35:51.920]  on an open and shut case and then how classic police work's done,
[35:51.920 --> 35:53.920]  this would be the case.
[35:53.920 --> 35:57.920]  And it's all taken by the Democrats that run Chicago with open lawyers
[35:57.920 --> 35:58.920]  that work for Obama.
[35:58.920 --> 36:01.920]  You know Obama's involved and they just wiped their whole butt with it,
[36:01.920 --> 36:03.920]  just went, nothing's being done.
[36:03.920 --> 36:07.920]  As a raw exercise of power like the governor of Virginia saying,
[36:07.920 --> 36:10.920]  we're going to keep babies alive after they're born and take their organs
[36:10.920 --> 36:14.920]  and there ain't crap you're going to do.
[36:14.920 --> 36:17.920]  And I'm going to dress up in blackface or KKK outfits.
[36:17.920 --> 36:22.920]  You're not going to do anything about it.
[36:22.920 --> 36:28.920]  But if somebody else ever did it, well, they're going to lose their job.
[36:28.920 --> 36:31.920]  Let me finish up with this area of the Russia thing.
[36:31.920 --> 36:34.920]  Here he is.
[36:34.920 --> 36:37.920]  James Clapper yesterday reacts to call.
[36:37.920 --> 36:45.920]  He should be investigated by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.
[36:45.920 --> 36:46.920]  Here he is.
[36:46.920 --> 36:48.920]  Robert Mueller is done investigating the president.
[36:48.920 --> 36:51.920]  White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders is calling on Congress
[36:51.920 --> 36:55.920]  to investigate former top U.S. intelligence officials.
[36:55.920 --> 36:58.920]  If Congress is so gung-ho to call people up to the Hill,
[36:58.920 --> 37:01.920]  the list I would start with are Comey, Clapper, Brennan,
[37:01.920 --> 37:05.920]  and other people in the FBI who perpetuated this absurd lie
[37:05.920 --> 37:08.920]  and this absurd idea that the president of the United States
[37:08.920 --> 37:11.920]  was somehow a foreign agent including with another government.
[37:11.920 --> 37:13.920]  What is your reaction to what Sanders said?
[37:13.920 --> 37:19.920]  Well, first, I wonder if she was conflating or confusing collusion,
[37:19.920 --> 37:22.920]  whatever that is, with the Russian interference.
[37:22.920 --> 37:25.920]  And certainly, those of us that she named,
[37:25.920 --> 37:30.920]  John Brennan and Jim Comey and I are part of the group
[37:30.920 --> 37:33.920]  that were tasked by President Obama
[37:33.920 --> 37:37.920]  to put together all the reporting we had on the Russian interference,
[37:37.920 --> 37:40.920]  which we did.
[37:40.920 --> 37:45.920]  President Obama directly and personally confronted Putin
[37:45.920 --> 37:47.920]  about the Russian interference in September
[37:47.920 --> 37:52.920]  and did not accept to face value Putin's protestations.
[37:52.920 --> 37:56.920]  John Brennan directly did the same thing with his counterpart.
[37:56.920 --> 37:59.920]  On October 7th of 16, we put out a statement.
[37:59.920 --> 38:01.920]  I say we, Jim, and I follow it.
[38:01.920 --> 38:05.920]  He goes on to say I was given the order from Obama.
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.920]  Now, remember, they were setting up their fake story
[38:09.920 --> 38:12.920]  in the middle of 2016, up to the election,
[38:12.920 --> 38:15.920]  and up to election day, they had the headline,
[38:15.920 --> 38:20.920]  wiretap show Trump met with Russians during election
[38:20.920 --> 38:22.920]  to steal the election.
[38:22.920 --> 38:25.920]  And then I'd go, hey, they're denying after Trump got elected
[38:25.920 --> 38:28.920]  and in office that they ever did this, but here it is.
[38:28.920 --> 38:31.920]  And remember, the New York Times would say, Jones is crazy.
[38:31.920 --> 38:33.920]  CNN would say, Jones is crazy.
[38:33.920 --> 38:36.920]  But then I would show the articles and then show their new clips,
[38:36.920 --> 38:38.920]  and their answer was, just get Jones off air.
[38:38.920 --> 38:40.920]  Just get him off air.
[38:40.920 --> 38:44.920]  Well, guess what? You failed again, you anti-American scumbags.
[38:44.920 --> 38:47.920]  Comey, Brennan and Clapper.
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.920]  Comey, Clapper and Brennan that you see on screen.
[38:51.920 --> 38:54.920]  Brennan was an admitted communist and admits he still is
[38:54.920 --> 38:59.920]  and wrote white papers in college how much he hates America.
[38:59.920 --> 39:01.920]  The other two wrote similar crap.
[39:01.920 --> 39:04.920]  Why do you think they got put in power?
[39:04.920 --> 39:13.920]  Because these are sacks of un-American garbage.
[39:13.920 --> 39:16.920]  And they've been caught lying to Congress.
[39:16.920 --> 39:20.920]  They opened criminal investigations and espionage investigations
[39:20.920 --> 39:24.920]  into Trump when he was president-elect.
[39:24.920 --> 39:31.920]  Then they opened a new one up after Comey got fired.
[39:31.920 --> 39:33.920]  Think about that. Think about the nerve.
[39:33.920 --> 39:43.920]  And then they went before Congress and said, we never investigated Trump.
[39:43.920 --> 39:46.920]  As if Congress couldn't go read the front page of the New York Times.
[39:46.920 --> 39:48.920]  But here's the problem.
[39:48.920 --> 39:50.920]  Just like the Google executive goes up there and says,
[39:50.920 --> 39:52.920]  we've never fixed search results.
[39:52.920 --> 39:54.920]  We've never gained any results.
[39:54.920 --> 39:56.920]  We've never censored any conservatives.
[39:56.920 --> 39:59.920]  Then they have top research universities study it and they go,
[39:59.920 --> 40:01.920]  my God, they're stealing every election now.
[40:01.920 --> 40:04.920]  2018 was stolen. They're going to steal 2020.
[40:04.920 --> 40:08.920]  And that's my lead story at the start of the next hour.
[40:08.920 --> 40:13.920]  If Trump doesn't take action on internet censorship,
[40:13.920 --> 40:20.920]  his Achilles heel and our Achilles heel is the fact there's still the election in 2020,
[40:20.920 --> 40:22.920]  just as the sun came up this morning.
[40:22.920 --> 40:25.920]  In fact, you guys pull me all the Google scientists,
[40:25.920 --> 40:31.920]  tech scientist articles from the last few days that were in yesterday's stack about that.
[40:31.920 --> 40:34.920]  I want to cover that next hour again because there's ways to counter this.
[40:34.920 --> 40:37.920]  But we've already beaten this one coup.
[40:37.920 --> 40:39.920]  We've already beaten this attempted overthrow,
[40:39.920 --> 40:44.920]  this takedown of an elected president and the takedown of the voters will
[40:44.920 --> 40:47.920]  to make America successful again.
[40:47.920 --> 40:51.920]  But we just lost the 2018.
[40:51.920 --> 40:53.920]  Hands down.
[40:53.920 --> 41:00.920]  Demographers, statisticians, top computer experts that scanned what Google's doing,
[41:00.920 --> 41:02.920]  they are flipping the seats.
[41:02.920 --> 41:04.920]  They are shifting millions and millions of voters.
[41:04.920 --> 41:08.920]  They stole almost all the seats they won in 2018
[41:08.920 --> 41:14.920]  because there's a nationalist patriot landslide happening.
[41:14.920 --> 41:17.920]  And the globalists don't know what to do so they're involved in pure cheating.
[41:17.920 --> 41:21.920]  So we may have beaten this two and a half year witch hunt so far,
[41:21.920 --> 41:24.920]  but the real fraud is big tech.
[41:24.920 --> 41:29.920]  The real fraud is them delivering the election to whoever the Democrat is,
[41:29.920 --> 41:32.920]  even if it doesn't make sense and isn't based on reality.
[41:32.920 --> 41:36.920]  And the media is already going, oh, Trump's going to challenge 2020 when he loses.
[41:36.920 --> 41:38.920]  He's going to claim his election fraud.
[41:38.920 --> 41:45.920]  They're already putting that talking point out because they just got away with it.
[41:45.920 --> 41:48.920]  So all hands on deck about this, the election fraud.
[41:48.920 --> 41:52.920]  It's absolutely paramount.
[41:52.920 --> 41:54.920]  It's absolutely central.
[41:54.920 --> 41:56.920]  It's key.
[41:56.920 --> 42:00.920]  It's the number one issue.
[42:00.920 --> 42:03.920]  If you want to save babies, not have them aborted at birth.
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.920]  If you want to stop your children being brainwashed into pedophilia at age five,
[42:07.920 --> 42:09.920]  now happening nationwide.
[42:09.920 --> 42:12.920]  If you want to turn this around, we have to win 2020.
[42:12.920 --> 42:14.920]  We have to get the house.
[42:14.920 --> 42:19.920]  We have to eradicate politically the Democrats and their evil chai-com funders.
[42:19.920 --> 42:24.920]  We have to eradicate them politically from the face of this nation
[42:24.920 --> 42:29.920]  because they're coming to politically eradicate us out of the seats of power.
[42:29.920 --> 42:30.920]  We don't want power.
[42:30.920 --> 42:32.920]  They want power.
[42:32.920 --> 42:36.920]  But we have to get into the seats of power to stop them and let's do it.
[42:36.920 --> 42:38.920]  Let's roll up our sleeves. Let's take action.
[42:38.920 --> 42:40.920]  And a big way to do it, spread the word about this broadcast.

[44:05.920 --> 44:09.920]  It's you that has defeated Hillary and the globalist.
[44:09.920 --> 44:12.920]  It is you, the info warriors across the planet,
[44:12.920 --> 44:15.920]  that stood against the bullying, that stood against the peer pressure,
[44:15.920 --> 44:18.920]  that stood against the threats that have now changed the world.

[44:20.920 --> 44:23.920]  supporting us, praying for us and spreading the word.

[44:24.920 --> 44:27.920]  And now because of their intensifying censorship,
[44:27.920 --> 44:32.920]  it's more important than ever that everyone go to infowars.com forward slash newsletter

[44:55.920 --> 45:19.920]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[45:25.920 --> 45:51.920]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[45:56.920 --> 46:02.920]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[46:02.920 --> 46:07.920]  Hundreds of different political systems and most of them are funded by the globalist.
[46:07.920 --> 46:10.920]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[46:10.920 --> 46:13.920]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it, trying to shut it down.
[46:13.920 --> 46:15.920]  I didn't invent all this.
[46:15.920 --> 46:19.920]  I went and researched the renaissance, Americana and what really works for humanity
[46:19.920 --> 46:21.920]  and I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[46:21.920 --> 46:25.920]  And lo and behold, it's super popular like it's always been.
[46:25.920 --> 46:28.920]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[46:28.920 --> 46:33.920]  because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine.
[46:33.920 --> 46:37.920]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and Infowars
[46:37.920 --> 46:40.920]  by buying the great products at infowars.com, by spreading the articles,
[46:40.920 --> 46:43.920]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation
[46:43.920 --> 46:47.920]  and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[46:47.920 --> 46:51.920]  For myself and the whole Infowars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done
[46:51.920 --> 46:54.920]  because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[46:54.920 --> 47:22.920]  You are the Infowar and I salute you.
[47:24.920 --> 47:42.920]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, Back Live.
[47:42.920 --> 47:56.920]  Thank you for joining us.
[47:56.920 --> 48:22.920]  And deep within their senses, the globalists know they're defenseless.
[48:22.920 --> 48:26.920]  Yes, they like to target children and the unborn and the defenseless
[48:26.920 --> 48:31.920]  and the mentally ill and the handicapped so the vampires can have their way over them.
[48:31.920 --> 48:40.920]  But while you're hunched over your prey, can you feel all that wind on your back?
[48:40.920 --> 48:45.920]  That's the big wings of the angel coming down to grab you by your neck
[48:45.920 --> 48:50.920]  and take you and drop you into the pit where all the rest of you go.
[48:50.920 --> 48:54.920]  Let's get back to serious news here.
[48:54.920 --> 48:59.920]  Well, the police have said they're furious about the fact that Jesse Smollett
[48:59.920 --> 49:11.920]  was only given a charge of disorderly conduct where he was facing a maximum of a couple years
[49:11.920 --> 49:14.920]  for trying to cause a race war, for provocaturing,
[49:14.920 --> 49:19.920]  for demanding the police catch an imaginary person, having 40 detectives on the case for weeks,
[49:19.920 --> 49:23.920]  diverting them from other critical needs and people that were really being attacked
[49:23.920 --> 49:28.920]  and shot and killed in the murder capital of the United States, Chicago.
[49:28.920 --> 49:32.920]  And then we started getting rumblings that, oh, Obama has connections.
[49:32.920 --> 49:34.920]  Smollett hangs out with them all the time.
[49:34.920 --> 49:35.920]  That's confirmed.
[49:35.920 --> 49:42.920]  The Empire cast, the directors, the producers, the lawyers, and the prosecutor.
[49:42.920 --> 49:49.920]  Kim Fox, she tried to get charges dropped before us. The police got really mad.
[49:49.920 --> 49:54.920]  And then 12 more charges got put on him after she got removed.
[49:54.920 --> 49:56.920]  But then something happened.
[49:56.920 --> 50:04.920]  An Obama lawyer got involved, Tina Chin.
[50:04.920 --> 50:10.920]  And now the charges have been dropped and Jesse Smollett pays $10,000.
[50:10.920 --> 50:12.920]  You know, wrong.
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.920]  And you better believe he's going to be back on TV saying they put that noose around that neck.
[50:17.920 --> 50:19.920]  They poured that bleach on him.
[50:19.920 --> 50:20.920]  Well, it didn't matter.
[50:20.920 --> 50:26.920]  We've got the cutouts at the brother's house where they cut out the magazines to send him the first,
[50:26.920 --> 50:29.920]  you know, die letter.
[50:29.920 --> 50:30.920]  It doesn't matter.
[50:30.920 --> 50:35.920]  They've got him going to the two shops and buying the hats and buying the rope and buying the bleach
[50:35.920 --> 50:39.920]  and the gas and everything else and the ski mask.
[50:39.920 --> 50:40.920]  It doesn't matter.
[50:40.920 --> 50:42.920]  You've got two eyewitnesses at work for him.
[50:42.920 --> 50:43.920]  It doesn't matter.
[50:43.920 --> 50:46.920]  They've got the check, stub, the copy of the check.
[50:46.920 --> 50:47.920]  It doesn't matter.
[50:47.920 --> 50:51.920]  You've got a classic open and shut case.
[50:51.920 --> 50:54.920]  Open the case, shut the case.
[50:54.920 --> 50:56.920]  Open the case, shut the case.
[50:56.920 --> 51:01.920]  You've got a sickening chain of evidence.
[51:01.920 --> 51:06.920]  Undeniable video of it all happening.
[51:06.920 --> 51:13.920]  Next book, open and shut, ironclad, no way you can lose, case.
[51:13.920 --> 51:21.920]  And that smart ass, arrogant, race-baiting globalist, clearly under the directive of the Chicago Community Organizer.
[51:21.920 --> 51:23.920]  That means stirring the community up.
[51:23.920 --> 51:29.920]  Jesse Smollett walks bigger than Dallas.
[51:29.920 --> 51:32.920]  Isn't that just sweet?
[51:32.920 --> 51:35.920]  Isn't that just darling?
[51:35.920 --> 51:38.920]  Isn't that just the cutest thing you ever saw?
[51:38.920 --> 51:49.920]  And all the people that said this poor black gay man attacked at two in the morning out in the middle of a freezing snowstorm when he went to the sub shop.
[51:49.920 --> 51:52.920]  And it was all fake.
[51:52.920 --> 51:54.920]  Doesn't matter now, though.
[51:54.920 --> 51:59.920]  He gets to skate absolutely free.
[51:59.920 --> 52:03.920]  Can you queue it up where he says some people are denying this and then starts crying?
[52:03.920 --> 52:06.920]  It's just terrible.
[52:06.920 --> 52:16.920]  It's like saying a one-eyed, one-horned, flying purple people eater attacked you at 2.30 in the morning in a freezing snowstorm when nobody else is out.
[52:16.920 --> 52:23.920]  And then two guys run up screaming, this is MAGA country, down with empire, down with inwards, as if they knew you were an empire.
[52:23.920 --> 52:32.920]  They were just waiting knowing you'd be there and then put a noose around your neck and the cops get there 45 minutes later and you got it hanging around your neck.
[52:32.920 --> 52:38.920]  This is all being done because Obama is connected to it.
[52:38.920 --> 52:47.920]  Just like Brennan and all of them are playing the card of Obama ordered us to spy on Trump and do the Russia gate and pay for the PP gate dossier.
[52:47.920 --> 52:49.920]  And if you think BuzzFeed's going to get in trouble with that, they're not.
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.920]  BuzzFeed's getting hired to merge with CNN.
[52:54.920 --> 52:57.920]  They're going to be rewarded for lying.
[52:57.920 --> 52:59.920]  It's what they do.
[52:59.920 --> 53:03.920]  Like this weekend, I'm in a Lucy's fried chicken with my wife.
[53:03.920 --> 53:11.920]  People walk by three times and say, eat, you know what, eat, you know what, you're going to get it, you're going to get it, eff you, eff you, eff you.
[53:11.920 --> 53:18.920]  I walk out, they're all waiting outside the door for me, flipping me off, saying kill the rich, eat the rich, saying they're going to get me.
[53:18.920 --> 53:21.920]  I try to walk past them and can't help it and say, fine, get up.
[53:21.920 --> 53:31.920]  They begin yelling, he's attacked us, we're innocent, he came to our table, security, security, they're experts, that's the left.
[53:31.920 --> 53:40.920]  Their whole culture, their whole mindset, their whole universe is manipulating people that have conscience.
[53:40.920 --> 53:42.920]  Most of them are sociopaths.
[53:42.920 --> 53:47.920]  That's why they constantly try to manipulate those of us that have a conscience.
[53:47.920 --> 53:51.920]  So there's Jesse Smollett with Michelle Obama.
[53:51.920 --> 53:53.920]  We can show you him with Obama, his good buddy.
[53:53.920 --> 53:57.920]  And the word is, I told you a month ago there was a federal investigation, now it's coming out.
[53:57.920 --> 54:03.920]  And it goes right up to Obama so they had to drop the case or Jesse was going to talk.
[54:03.920 --> 54:12.920]  Maybe you could put Jesse on a Commerce Department flight to the Balkans like Treasury Secretary Ron Brown.
[54:12.920 --> 54:18.920]  So Ron Brown said he would talk about the Clintons if he got indicted, and then he did get indicted.
[54:18.920 --> 54:22.920]  And of course the Air Force Coroner said he was shot in the head.
[54:22.920 --> 54:31.920]  They had soldiers on board who killed everybody on board, blew the hatch open, and then what is it, high load or he load?
[54:31.920 --> 54:38.920]  Out, parachuted out, and then the plane went into the mountainside, but one woman lived unscathed.
[54:38.920 --> 54:42.920]  She died in the ambulance ride back.
[54:42.920 --> 54:45.920]  I wonder how long Jesse Smollett is going to be alive.
[54:45.920 --> 54:47.920]  I hope nothing ever happens to him.
[54:47.920 --> 54:53.920]  I'm saying he's in danger of the deep state killing him.
[54:53.920 --> 54:56.920]  But see, there's no need now because the charges were dropped.
[54:56.920 --> 55:01.920]  But see, oh, there's going to be other federal investigations, you see.
[55:01.920 --> 55:07.920]  And there's federal investigations of Kim Fox and Tina Chin reportedly going on.
[55:07.920 --> 55:12.920]  And so I wonder what's going to happen there.
[55:12.920 --> 55:22.920]  These Obama lawyers and confidants flapping around the investigation.
[55:22.920 --> 55:32.920]  Obama is the wicked witch, and these are her little servants that go flapping out of the castle to carry out their operations.
[55:32.920 --> 55:34.920]  And they're above the law.
[55:34.920 --> 55:35.920]  They're the establishment.
[55:35.920 --> 55:39.920]  They went to college, they joined the We Hate America group like Brennan and Clapper.
[55:39.920 --> 55:44.920]  And now they get to squat on America and stage false flags and try to cause race wars and get caught red-handed.
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.920]  And nothing happens to them because they're the anointed ones.
[55:49.920 --> 55:58.920]  Like the six women lying about Kavanaugh getting caught.
[55:58.920 --> 56:02.920]  But the people lying about Russiagate setting that up, not getting in trouble.
[56:02.920 --> 56:10.920]  They've learned they can do whatever they want and they never get in trouble because they control the system.
[56:10.920 --> 56:12.920]  They're in charge.
[56:12.920 --> 56:21.920]  And so they get to commit crimes and rub it in our faces, but there's something called the Court of Public Opinion.
[56:21.920 --> 56:25.920]  And that court has convicted you all and doesn't believe a word because, you know, it's not just that.
[56:25.920 --> 56:27.920]  It's Trump's going to lose the election for sure.
[56:27.920 --> 56:36.920]  98% chance New York Times scientific algorithm, they just make it up, call it an algorithm.
[56:36.920 --> 56:39.920]  Oh, Trump was a Russian agent.
[56:39.920 --> 56:41.920]  That gets totally disproven.
[56:41.920 --> 56:42.920]  Trump colluded.
[56:42.920 --> 56:43.920]  Trump did this.
[56:43.920 --> 56:44.920]  All that's disproven.
[56:44.920 --> 56:48.920]  Everything they do is a giant, stinking lie.
[56:48.920 --> 56:56.920]  This is the WMD story for the Democrats, but it's bigger because for three years almost, they've told us we're all Russians.
[56:56.920 --> 56:57.920]  Sucker Carlson's a Russian.
[56:57.920 --> 56:58.920]  Alex Jones is a Russian.
[56:58.920 --> 57:03.920]  Glenn Greenwald's a Russian.
[57:03.920 --> 57:04.920]  Rand Paul's a Russian agent.
[57:04.920 --> 57:05.920]  We got those clips coming up.
[57:05.920 --> 57:13.920]  Everybody's a Russian agent for not believing they're crap, but them who are actually globalists that hate the country.
[57:13.920 --> 57:14.920]  We're going to go to break.
[57:14.920 --> 57:15.920]  We're going to come back with the next hour.
[57:15.920 --> 57:17.920]  We've got a bunch of gas and a bunch of intel.
[57:17.920 --> 57:22.920]  Former congressman Bob Barr actually got impeachment going against Clinton and former CIA.
[57:22.920 --> 57:23.920]  He'll pop in.
[57:23.920 --> 57:24.920]  Paul Joseph Watson's coming on.
[57:24.920 --> 57:26.920]  Mike Adams and more.
[57:26.920 --> 57:32.920]  But I'll get the Trumps Achilles heel and how the enemy can still win straight ahead.

[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.920]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:52.920]  Infowars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:56.920]  I just keep saying that because they're battling around the clock to stop people from getting that information.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:00.920]  I'm going to shift gears into not just censorship.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:03.920]  This isn't just older censoring. Everybody's like, yeah, we know.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.920]  I used to tell Roger Stone, hey, everybody knows you're not a Russian agent.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:11.920]  Stop coming on the show. I hired you to be a pundit and I really like Roger.
[01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.920]  I hired you to be a pundit and to talk about the news.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:16.920]  You're really smart. You have a lot of connections.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:18.920]  Give us your take on issues in the news.
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:22.920]  Not Russia, Russia. I'm not a Russian agent. It's all fake.
[01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:24.920]  Russia, Russia. I'm not a Russian agent.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.920]  Of course, they didn't charge him for being a Russian agent.
[01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:39.920]  They charged him off testimony to Congress being a little different than other statements, which it really wasn't.
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.920]  But I get the same way about censorship.
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:45.920]  And I keep trying to explain to the crew who are awesome.
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:47.920]  It isn't just new stories about censorship.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.920]  It's that we're going to lose the 2020 if Congress doesn't take action.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.920]  We have to collate all the censorship, put it together with all the proof.
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:59.920]  We have to put reports together showing the perjury and then we have to hand deliver it.
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.920]  That means you. I've done it.
[01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:08.920]  I've been to Congress twice in person, five times with lawyers last year.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:16.920]  I spent a ton of money delivering reports to the president and to Congress about how the censorship is happening with examples, with URLs.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:26.920]  And Congress responded by word as they've even had like intelligence committee hearings about what to do with me.
[01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:31.920]  This boy is getting out of control. It's like Strom Thurman didn't like John Lennon.
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:37.920]  He signed that order. He said, we want John Lennon terminated.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.920]  Yeah, that's what goes on with these intelligence committee hearings.
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:46.920]  The Senate, well, if everybody kisses these senators ass because they sign off in the oversight for what goes on.
[01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:51.920]  And yes, folks, they've they've had discussions about.
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.920]  But here's the good news. We're already past you.
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:58.920]  Our truth got out to the president. The narrative's out there.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:06.920]  Another huge mission. We got Trump elected and we just helped hold his ass up for two and a half years while he tried to repair the country and did a damn good job.
[01:03:06.920 --> 01:03:13.920]  Man, for one of those victories, I'd give my life. This is called winning in spades, damn it.
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:19.920]  But let me tell you, I intend to have victory after victory after victory over these people.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:24.920]  But in case something happens to me, we need folks to get the full paradigm.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:31.920]  So we've put out reports, some of them we've published proving the censorship. Everybody else can get them. Just go flood Congress with it.
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:40.920]  Get on a plane, get on a bus, go to their offices, pick 10 House members you're going to go talk to and 10 Senate members.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.920]  They don't go and they're all scared like they're God.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:45.920]  You walk in and say, I'm here to deliver the Senate's report about the censorship.
[01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:48.920]  We're really concerned. Well, he's out to lunch or he's busy.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:54.920]  Well, I'm going to sit down for a while and then just walk around the Capitol for a few days.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:56.920]  You'll run into their asses or go to restaurants.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:04:03.920]  They're at go over and talk to them nicely or get other reports about censorship and email them 5,000 times a day.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:09.920]  Call them. Just get aggressive or we'll lose everything.
[01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.920]  Let me tell you something. We're barely winning.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:14.920]  Now we're winning.
[01:04:14.920 --> 01:04:24.920]  But the only place we've lost the last three years and boy, let me tell you, they tied us like a belly goat and screwed the hell out of us.
[01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:28.920]  It's 2018. They had a devastating victory.
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:33.920]  So while we're all running around giddy and snickering and giggling about this whole Russiagate thing,
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:36.920]  if they don't get indicted, it's a victory for them.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.920]  They held everything up for two plus years, sabotaged everything.
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.920]  Russiagate's a victory for them unless they get their treasonous asses locked up.
[01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:46.920]  Don Almighty!
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:49.920]  Stay with us. We have the keys to victory.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.920]  We have the light and the dark of the night and we're ready to win.
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:05:01.920]  Our grandparents, the great grandparents, know that they can't food during the falls.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:03.920]  They'd have it during the winter.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.920]  And that's what I'm talking about at M4sTour.com.
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:13.920]  With M4 Select, it's the full spectrum of my Patriots supply, one of the top most respected companies out there.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:21.920]  But because I private label it, I'm able to go below cost on contracts that all their other distributors aren't able to do.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:26.920]  But I want to be a market leader and I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:30.920]  We have those incredible sell prices back at M4sTour.com.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:32.920]  On M4 Select, storeable foods.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.920]  They've got special diet foods.
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.920]  They've got three month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.920]  They've got so many great products there.
[01:05:40.920 --> 01:05:43.920]  If you've got a three year supply, if stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.920]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.920]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products, and together with God's help, we are unstoppable.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:06:20.920]  M4sTour.com and M4 Select, high quality storeable foods, powered by my Patriots supply.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.920]  I think we have all the proof we need of a scandal that's arguably worse than Watergate.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:30.920]  Do we know if there is still this belief and aspect that the President is working for the Russians?
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:31.920]  I can't answer that.
[01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:34.920]  The U.S. President possibly working for the Russians.
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.920]  Possibly an unwitting pawn.
[01:06:36.920 --> 01:06:40.920]  Here's what the President said when asked if he was a secret Russian agent.
[01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:43.920]  The President did not directly answer the question.
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.920]  Why not just say no if that's the answer?
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.920]  There is tons of proof of potential collusion.
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:51.920]  We have dramatic evidence of collusion.
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:55.920]  How is it not collusion? How is all of that not collusion?
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.920]  The collusion piece of this, piece by piece, starting to be built out.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:04.920]  A political hurricane is out there at sea for him. We'll call it Hurricane Vladimir, if you will.
[01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:06.920]  Donald Trump knows the news is tightening.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]  The news is tightening.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.920]  The news is tightening, if you will.
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.920]  The news is tightening around the President.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.920]  The news is tightening.
[01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:14.920]  And I think they're shocked that the news is tightening.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:16.920]  And that people might go to jail.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.920]  He and POTUS are going to prison.
[01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:20.920]  Well, I think they're all going to end up together in prison.
[01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:21.920]  And maybe that's a good thing.
[01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.920]  Oh, my God.
[01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:26.920]  You might be in legal jeopardy because of the Mueller investigation.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.920]  But are you scared that you could go to jail?
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920]  The walls appear to be closing in on the President.
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.920]  The investigative walls are closing in.
[01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.920]  He feels the walls closing in.
[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:36.920]  The walls are closing in.
[01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:41.920]  Trump resigns, quote, once Mueller closes in on him and the family.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:46.920]  Anybody that writes an op-ed and suggests that Donald Trump
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:51.920]  has not put himself directly in the target of an obstruction charge
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.920]  is just fooling themselves and some very, very stupid,
[01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.920]  ill-informed readers.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.920]  The stack of counts of obstruction of justice
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:01.920]  that could be fatal to the Trump presidency.
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.920]  The House is going to have little choice the way this is going
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:07.920]  other than to start impeachment proceedings.
[01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:10.920]  The subpoena could relate to two areas of the probe
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.920]  that might ultimately lead to Trump's impeachment.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:17.920]  They are the kind of offenses that would call for impeachment hearings.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:20.920]  If someone walked in my office and said I was a subject
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.920]  of a multi-year criminal investigation
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:26.920]  led by former FBI Director Robert Mueller, I'd wet my pants.
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.920]  Mueller reminds me of the starfish which gets himself
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.920]  tightly around the clam and uses all its stuff
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:33.920]  to weaken and pry open the clam.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.920]  Now, this is a battle to the death as far as the clam is concerned.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.920]  If the starfish is able to open him even a little bit,
[01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.920]  open him open all the way.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.920]  And that's it, of course, for the clam.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.920]  He's the starfish's...
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.920]  So absolutely pathetic, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:48.920 --> 01:08:51.920]  And that's where these idiots are going.
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.920]  Again, I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:55.920]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:08:59.920]  Let's sit back and assess what's happened so far.
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.920]  We've had, as called for by the Democrats in the WikiLeaks,
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:08.920]  racial and cultural and religious and sexual diversions
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.920]  and divisions in this country to divide and conquer us.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.920]  And that's worked to a certain extent, but overall it's failed.
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:21.920]  And you've had the attempt to say the 2016 election was fake
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:24.920]  and that the Russians stole it.
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.920]  That has now failed.
[01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.920]  And you have the dragnet of the Mueller investigation
[01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:33.920]  meant to be given to other federal prosecutors in Chicago,
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.920]  in Southern District of New York, where the Democrats are in control.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.920]  But they didn't find anything that's connected to the president,
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.920]  so they've got an even bigger problem.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.920]  They still intend to move forward with those.
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.920]  Balazi Ford and all that fake garbage fell on its face.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:48.920]  That was a beta test for Trump.
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.920]  That's now not worked.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.920]  But let's talk about what has worked.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.920]  Again, they lied and said he wouldn't win the election.
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.920]  Major media had egg on its face for that.
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:01.920]  Totally discredited them.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.920]  They doubled down.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.920]  They said he was a Russian agent for two and a half years.
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:07.920]  They doubled down again.
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:11.920]  They failed, though, everywhere,
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:16.920]  except they held up the agenda of turning the economy back on
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.920]  and the Federal Reserve raised interest rates so much
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:20.920]  that they may have been able to slow it enough
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.920]  where we go into recession by the end of the year, they hope.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.920]  And they're putting that out in a unified propaganda spectrum.
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:30.920]  So they slowed down the recovery and may be successful there.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:33.920]  They slowed down reforms globally, may be successful there.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:35.920]  They tried to sabotage the peace deal with North Korea.
[01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:37.920]  They may be successful there.
[01:10:37.920 --> 01:10:40.920]  They tried to sabotage peace deals in Syria.
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:43.920]  They failed so far.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:49.920]  So they are fighting back really, really, really, really hard.
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:52.920]  But where have they had a devastating victory?
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.920]  Where has Trump been defeated?
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.920]  Where has America been defeated?
[01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:01.920]  You see, I don't talk about when America's been defeated to demoralize you.
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:04.920]  I don't talk about where we're losing to say we're losers.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.920]  We're winners.
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.920]  We fought back against the globalists.
[01:11:08.920 --> 01:11:10.920]  We've got nationalists and populists being elected everywhere.
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:12.920]  We fought back against their fake polls
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.920]  and their eight-to-one spending against Trump and got him in
[01:11:15.920 --> 01:11:17.920]  and broke the back of the corporate media.
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:20.920]  We've had a lot more victories than they've had.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:22.920]  But they're still the entrenched power structure.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.920]  So while everybody's celebrating,
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.920]  I like to Wolf's quote from Pulp Fiction,
[01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.920]  let's not start doing you-know-what yet
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:38.920]  until this is completely done.
[01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:40.920]  Until the mission's completed.
[01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:43.920]  You don't count your money when you're sitting at the table.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.920]  It'll be kind enough for counting when the deal is done.
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.920]  And the money I'm looking for is a future for my kids
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.920]  and the unborn and the born they're trying to kill now.
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:55.920]  So, we've talked a lot about it
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.920]  and now it's all over the news and confirmed
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:12:00.920]  that top computer scientists and top universities coming out
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.920]  saying Google in every congressional race they looked at
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.920]  gave hundreds-to-one coverage to the Democrat candidates
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:15.920]  in some cases never showed them
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:20.920]  or said political affiliation Nazi for all Republicans
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.920]  in California and other battleground states.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:28.920]  But what about just not showing you the other candidates?
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.920]  Google would do stuff like show you the Democrat
[01:12:31.920 --> 01:12:33.920]  running for Congress in your area
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.920]  and then show you the other third-party candidate
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.920]  but not the Republican.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:41.920]  And most people get their news now from Google.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.920]  93% of searches globally.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:47.920]  Over 90% in the U.S.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920]  Think about that.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.920]  Google flipped seats, shifted millions of votes to dims
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:54.920]  in 2018 midterms.
[01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.920]  Researcher tells RT.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:59.920]  And there's other ones.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.920]  And if Trump doesn't do something about this, we're screwed.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.920]  Leaked emails show Eric Schmidt played a crucial role
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.920]  in team Hillary's election and tried to steal the election for her.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:12.920]  QZ, that's in his own emails.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.920]  And when they failed, they doubled down even more.
[01:13:15.920 --> 01:13:18.920]  And so, there's the examples of this everywhere.
[01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.920]  You try to go to YouTube and type in Alex Jones
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.920]  and it only gives you force-fed, year-old videos
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:25.920]  that are anti-Alex Jones.
[01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:27.920]  You can't search for new ones.
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:31.920]  If there's a new hateful video, they'll add it in to the search.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.920]  And it's done like that to Michael Savage.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:36.920]  And it's done like that to congressional candidates.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.920]  And you see congressional candidates try to buy ads on Google.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:39.920]  They won't let them do it.
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:40.920]  Same thing on Twitter.
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:41.920]  Same thing on Facebook.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:47.920]  They won't even give them access to the people.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.920]  Imagine 20 years ago, if you heard a TV station
[01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.920]  wouldn't take somebody's political money.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.920]  There's laws against that.
[01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:58.920]  For TV, for radio, you can't take one political party's money
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.920]  and refuse to run their ads.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.920]  That's a violation of the Federal Election Commission rules.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:04.920]  And it should be.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.920]  But Google can do it.
[01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:09.920]  And they only looked at three races,
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.920]  all of which were totally skewed for Democrats.
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.920]  Then they looked at a bunch of other races
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:16.920]  with a smaller sample scan and found the same thing.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:18.920]  All over the country.
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:21.920]  I played the clip yesterday, but it's extremely informative.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.920]  We'll play it when we come back and think of the latest news on this front.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.920]  And then there's ways to fight back against it.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920]  We'll talk about that.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.920]  But the number one thing is this.
[01:14:30.920 --> 01:14:34.920]  We have internal Google videos, emails, text, all of it.
[01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:35.920]  And Google's the big enchilada.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.920]  Facebook's being targeted.
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:38.920]  Twitter's censoring as well.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:41.920]  But the big one is Google.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.920]  And if Google can be made to go back the way they were five years ago,
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.920]  they'd be getting steadily worse for five years
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.920]  and actually be free and open like they were
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.920]  and let their search engines just work again
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.920]  and give people access to information.
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.920]  There will be a landslide.
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.920]  We will win the House back.
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.920]  We will get more in the Senate.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:02.920]  And Trump will win by 65 points or more.
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:04.920]  That's what he really won by in 2016.
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.920]  But they had such election fraud, he barely won.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.920]  That's all we've got to do.
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:10.920]  Let me tell you something.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:14.920]  They were panicking, saying Hillary's got a 98% chance of winning.
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:17.920]  Trump will lose trying to create a confidence gap
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.920]  and make it look like she would win no matter what
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:23.920]  because they knew in internal polls, in bots, in tracking,
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.920]  where they can algorithm everything you're actually doing
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:30.920]  that Trump was at 65% of registered voters.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.920]  They had to skew all the polls, everything.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:33.920]  It didn't work.
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:36.920]  They've got a huge, herculean job because let me tell you something.
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.920]  Even mainline polls admit that are skewed.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:43.920]  Trump's more popular now than he was three years ago.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.920]  But if we don't stop this, they're going to win.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:48.920]  Plus, it allows violation of the First Amendment.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.920]  It's fraud.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:50.920]  They've lied to Congress.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:52.920]  He must take action.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:53.920]  They're beating us.
[01:15:53.920 --> 01:16:15.920]  They're beating us.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:42.920]  They're beating us.
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:56.920]  They're beating us.
[01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:57.920]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:16:57.920 --> 01:16:59.920]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago
[01:16:59.920 --> 01:17:01.920]  when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:02.920]  I sued the IRS in one.
[01:17:02.920 --> 01:17:05.920]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:07.920]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.920]  and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:11.920]  they thought might never be solved.
[01:17:11.920 --> 01:17:12.920]  I can help you too.
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:15.920]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:17.920]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:22.920]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:42.920]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:17:53.920 --> 01:18:07.920]  Feel the thrill only at slingbow.com.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:26.920]  We have developed, hands down, from our research,
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:32.920]  the most powerful, healthy energy drink pre-workout
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.920]  and beyond system in the world.
[01:18:35.920 --> 01:18:37.920]  There's nothing else like it.
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:38.920]  You must experience it.
[01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:40.920]  It is a total game changer
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.920]  and it comes in easy to use, packaged, mixed in,
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.920]  fruit juice, or water, whatever you'd like.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.920]  Warning though, it's very, very strong.
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:47.920]  It lasts 10 hours.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:49.920]  So take a half pack at the first time you take it
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:52.920]  because TurboForce is named TurboForce
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:54.920]  because it will take you into overdrive.
[01:18:54.920 --> 01:19:17.920]  TurboForce and M4sLive.com.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.920]  InfoWarsLife's cutting edge formula only brings you
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:32.920]  the highest quality, organic, and clinically studied ingredients.
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.920]  Cheap prebiotic fibers are used up only at the beginning
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:39.920]  of the colon, but our premium organic acacia fiber
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:42.920]  is slowly digested by the good bacteria
[01:19:42.920 --> 01:19:44.920]  throughout the entire colon
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:46.920]  for maximum prebiotic effect.

[01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:26.920]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.920]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m., 3 p.m. Central.
[01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:32.920]  I'm here on Alex Jones show.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:36.920]  I don't like to lose, but I'll be honest.
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:39.920]  We were losing to some neighboring country
[01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:43.920]  like Switzerland that had incredible wealth,
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:49.920]  high IQ, a better GDP, and was pro-gun and pro-family,
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:52.920]  and they'd infiltrated, and our government was third world.
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:55.920]  They were going to make us better.
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.920]  I wouldn't be a traitor to my country,
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.920]  but I would try to go sell my country members,
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:07.920]  my fellow countrymen and women, on let's marry Switzerland.
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:10.920]  But, see, instead, we're marrying the Chicoms,
[01:21:10.920 --> 01:21:17.920]  which is like marrying the devil's rear end.
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:20.920]  It's like climbing into a big, giant pile of dead bodies
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:22.920]  at a concentration camp.
[01:21:22.920 --> 01:21:27.920]  Like it, it is.
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:30.920]  And our big tech companies that we set up and paid for,
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:34.920]  that DARPA built, all of it, are all over there now in China.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.920]  That Q-up, Dumford, I'm at the plating in Yashda,
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.920]  I didn't, with the Secretary of Defense up front.
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:42.920]  And they're all over there doing that.
[01:21:42.920 --> 01:21:46.920]  That's reason enough right there to nationalize them as utilities.
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:48.920]  Stockholders still get their money, their stocks will go up,
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:52.920]  but you're not going to sit there and deny people free speech.
[01:21:52.920 --> 01:21:54.920]  If somebody calls for murder,
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:56.920]  if somebody is involved in a stock scam,
[01:21:56.920 --> 01:21:57.920]  if somebody's selling drugs,
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:58.920]  if you're doing something illegal,
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.920]  you get in trouble and off the Internet.
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:03.920]  The way it was always under Section 230.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:06.920]  But you don't run around censoring everybody
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:09.920]  and lining up your censorship with China
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.920]  so you get entry into China.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:15.920]  I remember, right before they banned me a year ago,
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.920]  a Chinese dictator was in the news praising U.S. tech
[01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.920]  for announcing censorship of, quote, fake news.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.920]  And he's like, we have our own fake news problems,
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.920]  but I'm glad to see you're getting reasonable.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.920]  Yeah, what's next? Arresting us?
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:35.920]  Yeah, New Zealand's not doing that.
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:39.920]  So we're becoming them. They're not becoming us.
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:42.920]  Got it?
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:45.920]  It's not a good deal.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:46.920]  And Mike Adams has written a big article
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:49.920]  about how to counter this garbage
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:52.920]  that Tim Cook has said in speeches in China,
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:56.920]  I support censorship and would support more of it in the West.
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:58.920]  And then he gets mad at me that I quote him.
[01:22:58.920 --> 01:23:00.920]  What a monster!
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.920]  President Trump can end big tech's treasonous censorship
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.920]  with a single signature, here's how.
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:08.920]  Big article from Mike Adams, naturalnews.com,
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.920]  full article posted on infowars.com. Get it out.
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:14.920]  There is a simple, powerful way that President Trump
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:17.920]  can end big tech's evil censorship with a single signature.
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:20.920]  It requires no act of Congress, no regulatory action,
[01:23:20.920 --> 01:23:22.920]  and no criminal prosecution, although at this point
[01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:24.920]  it seems that criminal prosecuting Google,
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:27.920]  election meddling would be justified as a separate action.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.920]  The move requires nothing more than Trump's signature
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.920]  on an executive order that cancels and prohibits
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:35.920]  all federal contracts with large-scale internet platforms
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:38.920]  that refuse to protect the First Amendment rights of all Americans,
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.920]  which is exactly what a little birdie told me.
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:44.920]  Well, this is what Trump will do with the universities,
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:46.920]  and now he's done it here.
[01:23:46.920 --> 01:23:48.920]  Oh, please.
[01:23:48.920 --> 01:23:51.920]  In a single signature, President Trump could end
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.920]  all government contracts with Google,
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:56.920]  Twitter, YouTube, Apple, and other dominant online platforms
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.920]  that are now maliciously deplatforming users
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:02.920]  for expressing conservative or Christian values.
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.920]  The president, mmm, so proud of him,
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:10.920]  in fact just issued a similar executive order demanding
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:13.920]  that universities respect free speech
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:16.920]  or find themselves terminated from all government grants.
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.920]  This strategy is an aggressive and effective.
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.920]  Those universities which choose to engage
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.920]  in un-American practice of suppressing speech
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:26.920]  or political reasons will quickly find themselves cut off
[01:24:26.920 --> 01:24:28.920]  from federal funds.
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:31.920]  Now President Trump needs to wreck the same tactic at tech giants.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:36.920]  This article needs to be emailed by all of you
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.920]  from naturalnews.com, from infowars.com
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:44.920]  to everyone you know and all talk radio shows
[01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.920]  and to others and to the White House and to the Capitol.
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:50.920]  You need to print it off and hand deliver it to Congress
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:53.920]  or when your congressman or woman is in your district,
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:56.920]  this is how we circumvent big tech censorship
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:03.920]  to deliver the winning blow against their fraud.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.920]  I also want to have a little thing we play occasionally
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:07.920]  at times like this.
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:10.920]  Can we get a marching drum?
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:13.920]  Vroom, droom, droom, droom, droom, droom, droom, droom, droom.
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:14.920]  Because that's what we need to do.
[01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:15.920]  Get on the march.
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:16.920]  We're on the march.
[01:25:16.920 --> 01:25:17.920]  The empire's on the run.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:20.920]  Do you understand, infowars, you the audience,
[01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:23.920]  have been at the center of the rally
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.920]  and the attack on the globalists worldwide
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.920]  that got Trump in and others in
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.920]  and now have stopped their deep state coup
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.920]  and now we have their final main attack profile,
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:36.920]  their main attack ship censorship,
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.920]  their main criminal breakaway groups
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.920]  that are selling the country out
[01:25:40.920 --> 01:25:44.920]  and the national security dead in our sights politically,
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:46.920]  non-violently.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.920]  We have them.
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:48.920]  We have them.
[01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:50.920]  But you must squeeze the trigger.
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.920]  And I can't squeeze.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.920]  It's too big for me to pull myself.
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.920]  But all of us going to rallies, going to events,
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.920]  going to congressmen and women's offices,
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.920]  bringing this up, e-mailing the stories,
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.920]  getting involved, making up the issue,
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.920]  beating the drum,
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:08.920]  that is what will change the world.
[01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:09.920]  Do you read me?
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:10.920]  Do you hear me?
[01:26:10.920 --> 01:26:11.920]  Do you understand me?
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:12.920]  This is it.
[01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.920]  We're close to winning.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:16.920]  But the enemy is rallying their forces.
[01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:17.920]  They're going to pull false flags
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:18.920]  and other dirty tricks.
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:19.920]  You know they are.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:22.920]  So don't think we're out of the woods yet, gentlemen.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:23.920]  We can see the meadow.
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.920]  We can see the River Jordan.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:26.920]  We can see it.
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:27.920]  We're almost there.
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.920]  But we've got to get out of these woods.
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.920]  And before we get out of the woods, you notice,
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.920]  we're kind of going up a rise up a little hill
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.920]  and there's gullies on both sides of us.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.920]  And you know, right before we get to the meadow
[01:26:38.920 --> 01:26:39.920]  and the River Jordan,
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.920]  you know what's going to hit us from both sides?
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.920]  The enemies lined up waiting with their swords,
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.920]  laying back on the riverbank,
[01:26:46.920 --> 01:26:48.920]  getting ready for us to come out and blow in a minute.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.920]  We break out and this final push,
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:53.920]  they're going to pull out every stop they got.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:56.920]  So just choose whether you're with America
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:58.920]  and the Renaissance and Christianity
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:00.920]  or whether you're with the Godless Chai comms.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.920]  Here's what's really happening from Congress last week.
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:07.920]  Let me just shift and ask about our challenge
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:10.920]  in emerging technologies, cyber and space,
[01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.920]  in particular China's investment in those areas
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.920]  and our eroding advantage.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.920]  I was struck, Mr. Secretary,
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:21.920]  by a comment that you make in your written testimony.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.920]  You say some U.S. companies have voiced ethical qualms
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:27.920]  about working with DOD to develop advanced technology,
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:30.920]  in some cases even terminating relationships,
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.920]  often while continuing to work with China.
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.920]  What are we talking about here?
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:38.920]  I think we're talking about Google
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:41.920]  and their support to China
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:44.920]  and their lack of support to the Department of Defense.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:48.920]  So Google has refused to work with the Department of Defense,
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:50.920]  actually was under contract, weren't they,
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:52.920]  with the Department of Defense? Tell us about that.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.920]  Well, they haven't refused.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:56.920]  They just have said they're not going to continue to do business
[01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.920]  with the Department of Defense on certain contracts.
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.920]  But they are doing business in China
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:04.920]  in a way that benefits your saying our Chinese competitors.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:05.920]  Correct.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.920]  Say more about that.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.920]  Well, the interesting thing,
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:12.920]  and this is why China is,
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:15.920]  this is such an important issue for our country,
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:19.920]  you know, the fusion of commercial business
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:22.920]  with military is significant.
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:24.920]  We're going to come back with the rest of this,
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:27.920]  then I'm going to open the phones up, but this is it.
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:30.920]  Let me tell you something.
[01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:32.920]  The American people in our universities
[01:28:32.920 --> 01:28:34.920]  and our scientists built all this stuff.
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:37.920]  You're not allowed to just hand it to the bloodthirsty chai cops.
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:40.920]  And I cannot believe the insane restraint
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:43.920]  of our government and the Pentagon to this treason.
[01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:45.920]  Let's see, we had traders in before like Obama.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:47.920]  And now we see how far this is going.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:51.920]  I mean, everybody knows what Google and others have done.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:54.920]  We know. You're very lucky.
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:28:59.920]  Ooh, get the stinky dog away from me.
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:01.920]  Bad breath and bad gas.
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.920]  PD stopped eating. All of his hair fell out.
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.920]  Itching, licking, missing fur.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.920]  At least $5,000 in that bill.
[01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:10.920]  The audit spray. No results.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:13.920]  Everything we tried failed except the Dynavite.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:15.920]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.920]  If you want the dog to be healthy, you got to feed the company healthy.
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:20.920]  The Omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.920]  Flaxseed, zinc, alfalfa, the digestive enzymes
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:26.920]  that are cooked out of regular dog food.
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.920]  Dynavite is nutrition.
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:30.920]  The shedding is stopped and itching is stopped.
[01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:32.920]  Her coat is not soft. It's silky.
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.920]  It's healthy and shiny and glossy.
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:37.920]  She's got life. She's got energy.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.920]  Tons of energy. No more bad smells.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.920]  Dynavite's the mom.
[01:29:41.920 --> 01:29:44.920]  Dynavite is the best thing that's ever happened to my dogs.
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.920]  You know, besides me, of course.
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:48.920]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:51.920]  8-5-9-4-2-8-1-thousand.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.920]  Dynavite for life.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:56.920]  D-I-N-O-V-I-T-E dot com.
[01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.920]  There are thousands of ideologies out there.
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.920]  Hundreds of different political systems.
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:05.920]  And most of them are funded by the globalist.
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:08.920]  Infowars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:10.920]  That's why the globalists are obsessed with it,
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:12.920]  trying to shut it down.
[01:30:12.920 --> 01:30:14.920]  I didn't invent all this.
[01:30:14.920 --> 01:30:16.920]  I went and researched the Renaissance, Americana,
[01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:18.920]  and what really works for humanity.
[01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.920]  And I'm simply trying to bring it back.
[01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:22.920]  And lo and behold, it's super popular,
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:24.920]  like it's always been.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:26.920]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down
[01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.920]  so desperately.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:30.920]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:32.920]  that sends chills up my spine.
[01:30:32.920 --> 01:30:34.920]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself
[01:30:34.920 --> 01:30:36.920]  and Infowars by buying the great products
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:38.920]  at infowarsstore.com, by spreading the articles,
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:41.920]  by spreading the videos, and by praying for this operation
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.920]  and for praying for this nation and the world
[01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:45.920]  for peace and discernment.
[01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:47.920]  For myself and the whole Infowars family,
[01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:50.920]  I want to thank all of you for what you've done.
[01:30:50.920 --> 01:30:53.920]  Because without you, Infowars is nothing.
[01:30:53.920 --> 01:31:05.920]  You are the Infowar, and I salute you.
[01:31:24.920 --> 01:31:27.920]  Happy's can be an important part of your daily supplement routine.
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:30.920]  With poor diet and the constant on and off of your work life,
[01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:33.920]  it's more important than ever to support your body
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:35.920]  in the fight against stress.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.920]  With powerful ingredients combined
[01:31:37.920 --> 01:31:39.920]  to help support the mind and body,
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:41.920]  Happy's helps support during stress,
[01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.920]  promotes overall well-being,
[01:31:43.920 --> 01:31:45.920]  and helps support your mood.
[01:31:45.920 --> 01:31:47.920]  Don't live your life bogged down.
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:50.920]  Help your body overcome the effects of daily stress
[01:31:50.920 --> 01:31:52.920]  and pressure today.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:56.920]  With Happy's from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:24.920]  I mean, what's it going to take?
[01:32:24.920 --> 01:32:26.920]  Us being shut down? Is that what you want, Frank?
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.920]  You know what, Alex?
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:30.920]  Hey, put him on pause again. Hey, Frank!
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:32.920]  Do you understand it's not bragging to say
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:34.920]  we are the tip of the spear, we're under attack,
[01:32:34.920 --> 01:32:36.920]  we need your help.
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:38.920]  As much begging as I do, we can barely pay the bills
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:40.920]  and grow in the face of this.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:42.920]  I'm not going to just stop growth
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:44.920]  and let them start pushing us backwards.
[01:32:44.920 --> 01:32:46.920]  You understand? I need your help, Frank!
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:52.920]  Go to Infowarsstore.com right now and help fund the Infowars.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:54.920]  Do you understand? I need your help, Frank!
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:33:22.920]  Free Press needs your help, Frank!
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:25.920]  Well, somebody who's got guts to take action
[01:33:25.920 --> 01:33:27.920]  is former congressman, former CIA officer,
[01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:29.920]  Bob Barr, libertyguard.org,
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:31.920]  bobbar.org.
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:33.920]  And I wanted to get him on weeks ago
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:35.920]  about a bunch of other issues, but he's able to get on now.
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:37.920]  I want to talk about the Senate
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:39.920]  looking at red flag rules,
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:41.920]  just taking guns without due process,
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:43.920]  talking about civil war.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.920]  Trump signs onto that, that's going to really hurt him
[01:33:45.920 --> 01:33:47.920]  and the country.
[01:33:47.920 --> 01:33:49.920]  And he's on a good streak right now.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:51.920]  I want to get into China and Google
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:54.920]  and how Google's helping China, but not us,
[01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:56.920]  and how that's come into a head,
[01:33:56.920 --> 01:33:58.920]  and how crazy all the censorship is
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:01.920]  and how could President Trump take action against that.
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.920]  But first, I want to get into,
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:05.920]  because I know he's also a lawyer and a lot of other things,
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:08.920]  with Bob Barr, his take on two and a half years of Russiagate,
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.920]  all the lying to Congress.
[01:34:10.920 --> 01:34:12.920]  I mean, just his take on where we need to go,
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:15.920]  because it seems like people need to get in trouble
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:19.920]  for what they've done, like McCabe and all these other folks.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:22.920]  But now we're hearing, oh, Obama ordered him to do it.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:25.920]  Well, we'd always known that, but they'd tried to cover it up.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:28.920]  So this thing is just making what Nixon did
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:29.920]  look tame in comparison.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:30.920]  You've worn a lot of hats.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.920]  What does this really look like to you?
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.920]  Trump calls it an attempted takedown or coup that failed.
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:38.920]  It clearly is an effort of Alex
[01:34:38.920 --> 01:34:41.920]  to go after a president,
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:44.920]  a sitting president that the left doesn't like
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:47.920]  and wish had not been elected,
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.920]  but to do so by whatever means
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:54.920]  they have at their disposal, including the abuse
[01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:56.920]  of the prosecutorial process.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.920]  We saw that with the Mueller probe,
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:02.920]  with the so-called impeachment power,
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:04.920]  well, not so-called, but the impeachment power
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:06.920]  of the House of Representatives,
[01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.920]  as well as the oversight role of the Congress being abused.
[01:35:10.920 --> 01:35:12.920]  So you add all of this together,
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:16.920]  and it's a very toxic mix of an effort to,
[01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:19.920]  as you say, take down a president
[01:35:19.920 --> 01:35:22.920]  honestly and duly elected pursuant to constitution
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:24.920]  and laws in our country,
[01:35:24.920 --> 01:35:28.920]  but with which the left simply disagrees.
[01:35:28.920 --> 01:35:30.920]  And again, we're not vindictive,
[01:35:30.920 --> 01:35:32.920]  but you're one of the few guys that actually take action
[01:35:32.920 --> 01:35:33.920]  to get the impeachment started on Clinton
[01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.920]  that at least slowed down his criminal activity.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.920]  I think it's a dereliction of duty
[01:35:37.920 --> 01:35:39.920]  if some type of action isn't taken
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:40.920]  if there aren't investigations.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:42.920]  Instead, the Democrats are launching
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:45.920]  a bunch of their new fake investigations.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:47.920]  What they're doing is two things.
[01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:48.920]  One, by omission.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.920]  They are refusing to go after the criminal activities
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.920]  that are well-documented against Hillary Clinton
[01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:01.920]  and the so-called Clinton Foundation.
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:05.920]  Nobody in Washington seems to be at all interested
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:10.920]  in that whole group of criminal evidence.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.920]  And secondly, what Congress is doing
[01:36:12.920 --> 01:36:16.920]  is they are continuing to pursue relentlessly
[01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:21.920]  and with blinders affixed to them anti-Trump investigations
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:24.920]  based on who knows what.
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:26.920]  But one would have hoped, Alex,
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:31.920]  that after more than two years of the so-called Mueller probe
[01:36:31.920 --> 01:36:34.920]  with thousands of subpoenas,
[01:36:34.920 --> 01:36:36.920]  literally thousands of subpoenas,
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.920]  hundreds of search warrants,
[01:36:39.920 --> 01:36:42.920]  millions of dollars spent
[01:36:42.920 --> 01:36:45.920]  that the Democrats would at least have the decency
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:47.920]  and the responsibility to say,
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.920]  okay, we were wrong.
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:51.920]  There was nothing there in the first place.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:53.920]  It's been investigated thoroughly.
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:54.920]  Now let's move on.
[01:36:54.920 --> 01:36:56.920]  They refuse to do that.
[01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920]  And by doing that, they are doing a disservice
[01:36:58.920 --> 01:37:00.920]  to their representatives across the,
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:03.920]  or to the citizens that they represent across the country
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:05.920]  because there is no agenda.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:07.920]  They seem to have no interest
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.920]  in any of the substantive matters
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.920]  for which members of Congress are elected to pursue.
[01:37:13.920 --> 01:37:15.920]  And regardless of what happens in the courts
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.920]  or what happens in the executive branch of the FBI,
[01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:19.920]  the Court of Public Opinion,
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:21.920]  we saw them lie about who was going to win the election,
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.920]  fake polls, giving the questions of CNN.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.920]  Now, Donna Brazile's been hired by Fox News,
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:26.920]  whatever that means.
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.920]  You've got the Belasi Ford fake thing falling apart.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.920]  You've got all the other lies
[01:37:32.920 --> 01:37:34.920]  about Trump, Russiagate falling apart,
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:36.920]  the Jesse Smollett falling apart.
[01:37:36.920 --> 01:37:38.920]  Everything they do falling apart.
[01:37:38.920 --> 01:37:41.920]  And now the Russiagate coming off the rails.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:45.920]  I mean, the mainstream media has zero credibility.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:47.920]  Well, it'll be interesting, for example, Alex,
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:50.920]  to see what they do with the Abinadi cases.
[01:37:50.920 --> 01:37:54.920]  One of the left, one of the darlings of the leftist media
[01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:58.920]  now finds himself in very serious legal trouble.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.920]  And how the left and the leftist media response
[01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.920]  to that will be very, very interesting.
[01:38:03.920 --> 01:38:07.920]  See if they hold him and the coverage of Abinadi
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:11.920]  to the same standard, which they held Mueller,
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.920]  you know, St. Mueller, I guess.
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.920]  It's the best way to describe them.
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:19.920]  I've left media St. Mueller and, you know,
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:21.920]  Satan, which to them is Trump.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:26.920]  It'll be interesting to see how they handle Mr. Abinadi.
[01:38:26.920 --> 01:38:28.920]  Well, Mr. Abinadi threatened to show a lot of people
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:30.920]  to talk about him, but it's all come out.
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:34.920]  My lawyer Robert Barnes out in LA, he knows him.
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:36.920]  And if we set on air and off air,
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:38.920]  before this even happened a month ago, he said,
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:41.920]  listen, Abinadi's specialty is extortion.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:43.920]  And that's what he does.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:45.920]  And he's gotten away because he's a Democrat.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:47.920]  And he said, a lot of this is about to come out.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:48.920]  So I can't wait until he can talk about it on air
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:49.920]  because he'd already heard about this.
[01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:52.920]  But he's been, you know, obviously indicted or arrested
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.920]  for what, $25 million he demanded from Nike,
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:58.920]  or he was going to basically demonize them as racist.
[01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.920]  And so it looks like he's trying to be the new Al Sharpton.
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:05.920]  Well, he's Al Sharpton with no hair.
[01:39:05.920 --> 01:39:07.920]  All right, we're going to go to break in a few minutes,
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:09.920]  but let's get into what you wanted to cover front and center.
[01:39:09.920 --> 01:39:11.920]  Trump, I think, has a pretty good report card.
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:12.920]  Correct me if you think I'm wrong.
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920]  I mean, overall, he's done a lot of good.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:18.920]  But this banning bump stocks, which I know really are worthless.
[01:39:18.920 --> 01:39:19.920]  Okay.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:22.920]  But once you go down that road now, he's like red flag laws
[01:39:22.920 --> 01:39:24.920]  and the Senate's looking at this.
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:29.920]  This would just absolutely, I think, destroy Trump with his base.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:32.920]  It is a very disturbing trend that we're seeing here.
[01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:36.920]  And I think Trump at his core is very strong in support
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920]  of the Second Amendment.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:40.920]  He understands it and he understands the need to protect it
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:42.920]  against leftist efforts to undermine it.
[01:39:42.920 --> 01:39:46.920]  But by the same token, I think there are some in his administration
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:51.920]  that seem to have bought into this notion that, well,
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:56.920]  as long as we set up a mechanism to be able to identify bad players
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:00.920]  in advance of being bad players and take away their guns,
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:02.920]  that will solve the problem.
[01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:06.920]  It is a very, very troublesome road that they now seem to be going down.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:09.920]  You've been watching this as a congressional expert.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:12.920]  Well, what's currently happening at the Senate?
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:16.920]  The Senate with Lindsey Graham, a senator from South Carolina,
[01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:23.920]  now heading the Judiciary Committee, is holding its first major hearing
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:27.920]  of the new session of the Congress on so-called red flag laws
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:33.920]  or basically emergency gun confiscation orders.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:37.920]  And it's something that, Alex, it has a lot of surface appeal
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.920]  because one can point to the Parkland shooting last year
[01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.920]  and the fact that there were any number of so-called red flags
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:50.920]  about the murder of a student who committed those crimes
[01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:52.920]  that weren't followed up on.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:57.920]  But the proponents of these so-called red flag laws
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:00.920]  simply want to jump from the fact that there were red flags
[01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:03.920]  that weren't acted on in Parkland to saying,
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.920]  oh, okay, so the way that we solved the problem
[01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:10.920]  is to put in place red flag laws without saying,
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.920]  oh, wait a minute, stop.
[01:41:12.920 --> 01:41:14.920]  Think about what you're saying.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:16.920]  There were red flags in Parkland.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:19.920]  There were laws that could have been used to address that
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:22.920]  and procedures already in place, yet they weren't followed
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:24.920]  or they weren't adhered to.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.920]  And yet you want to now make it easy for the government
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.920]  to take away a person's fundamental right
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:33.920]  to keep in their arms based on speculation.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.920]  That's very, very troubling.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.920]  That's right, a new process.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:40.920]  The police stood down, they've admitted that.
[01:41:40.920 --> 01:41:42.920]  Major lawsuits for like 15 minutes.
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.920]  He was running around hearing voices.
[01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.920]  They called him a school shooter.
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:48.920]  He was protected.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:50.920]  He was under some weird leftist rule
[01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:52.920]  because he had a Hispanic last name and though he wasn't,
[01:41:52.920 --> 01:41:56.920]  that he was allowed to commit crimes, vandalism, physical attacks
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:58.920]  and didn't go to jail.
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:02.920]  I mean, it was a long raft of red flags that were all ignored.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.920]  So now with this creative due process,
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:08.920]  even though the regular red flags failed because the system failed,
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.920]  now the system just says, let's get rid of due process itself.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.920]  This is outrageous.
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920]  It is.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:20.920]  And while the idea, the notion behind these so-called red flag laws
[01:42:20.920 --> 01:42:22.920]  is not necessarily a bad one.
[01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:27.920]  It says, well, if a person is exhibiting very clear signs
[01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:32.920]  of violence, including with firearms,
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.920]  then it's appropriate for that to be looked into.
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:37.920]  But the fact of the matter is,
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:42.920]  there are already laws and procedures in place to address that.
[01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:46.920]  And rushing down this road of so-called red flag laws,
[01:42:46.920 --> 01:42:50.920]  which raises various, you've said, very serious issues,
[01:42:50.920 --> 01:42:54.920]  due process seems to be one that is...
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:56.920]  Let's talk about it. We've got to go to break. This is important.
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:42:57.920]  It's simple.
[01:42:57.920 --> 01:42:58.920]  If you want to beat the globalists,
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:00.920]  if you want to take on the new world order,
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:03.920]  I'm not doing Bitcoin pumping dumps with Jack Dorsey.
[01:43:03.920 --> 01:43:05.920]  I'm not sitting here selling you cancer cures.
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:08.920]  I'm not sitting here selling you late-term abortion
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:09.920]  and all the great it is.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:12.920]  I just go out and say, what is the top heart pill?
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:13.920]  What is the top tumor?
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.920]  It's the best seller because it's anti-inflammatory.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:17.920]  And what's the best lab in the country?
[01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:18.920]  Okay, they're the highest rated.
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.920]  I'm like, you're only 50% curcuminoid?
[01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:22.920]  Well, yeah, they only put $5 product in the bottle,
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:24.920]  but that's still incredible, sir.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.920]  I'm like, what's the highest you could do a month later?
[01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:30.920]  90, 95%, no one's ever done that.
[01:43:30.920 --> 01:43:31.920]  I said, how much does that cost for a bottle?
[01:43:31.920 --> 01:43:32.920]  That costs $10.
[01:43:32.920 --> 01:43:34.920]  No one's ever done that, sir.
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:36.920]  The average competitor is 3% to 5%.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.920]  The top brand is 50%.
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:40.920]  I'm like, we're going to have 95% curcuminoid.
[01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:41.920]  I mean, you understand, like,
[01:43:41.920 --> 01:43:43.920]  that's like our information is explosive.
[01:43:43.920 --> 01:43:46.920]  Our fish oil, I go out and I get the cleanest, the best.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:47.920]  My children take it.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:49.920]  You think I'm going to give you fish oil
[01:43:49.920 --> 01:43:51.920]  that isn't the very damn best on my soul?
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.920]  You think I'm going to screw somebody over
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920]  like one of these devil worshipers?
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920]  Never.
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:57.920]  Don't come to theCourseWord.com.
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:44:01.920]  The globalist, the eugenicists are always talking down to us.
[01:44:01.920 --> 01:44:04.920]  They're always trying to make us feel small
[01:44:04.920 --> 01:44:05.920]  to feel insignificant.
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:08.920]  They try to censor because they fear you
[01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:11.920]  and don't want you to have the right to access information
[01:44:11.920 --> 01:44:13.920]  so you can make your own decisions.
[01:44:13.920 --> 01:44:16.920]  They want you to believe you're powerless.
[01:44:16.920 --> 01:44:18.920]  But the truth is, it is we, the people,
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:21.920]  and our ideas and our actions
[01:44:21.920 --> 01:44:24.920]  and what we say and what we do that changes the world,
[01:44:24.920 --> 01:44:31.280]  We are the power structure. We are the inventors. We are the trailblazers and the globalists
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:34.840]  Understand that and they understand
[01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:39.900]  That they are basically trying to control and steal the future from we the people
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:44.840]  Now to help fund our operation is undoubtedly the very tip of the spear against these globalist

[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:03.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:37.080]  Welcome back former congressman former CIA officer. You name it Bob Barr is our guest smart guy
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:43.400]  You know, he's headed up major movements to try to stop the TAA TSA violation of our basic rights world while our borders are open
[01:47:43.760 --> 01:47:47.840]  The president's come out recently and said how out of control it is. I don't even blame the TSA agents
[01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:51.520]  I blame the program and what's being done. It should be stopped at congressional level
[01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:56.960]  I want to get a quick comment from him on that but he wanted to bring up New Zealand where they're saying 10 years in jail
[01:47:56.960 --> 01:47:59.400]  If you possess the film of the murderer
[01:47:59.760 --> 01:48:05.800]  Well, that means subreder would get 10 years in jail or is that mean I remember growing up watching PBS
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.440]  My parents let me watch at the dinner table
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:13.520]  They'd roll the TV in and they'd march Jews into pits and shoot them in the back of the head and my parents said that's the Nazis
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:20.040]  They're bad. So it's just a clock at night seven o'clock at night on PBS when I was a kid. They showed Jews being shot in the back of the head
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.120]  Why can't we see this but but regardless 10 years in jail?
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:27.960]  And and all the gun banning and so this guy's being used
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:32.440]  They took a YouTube channel down that some fan had of our stuff saying we showed the footage
[01:48:32.440 --> 01:48:37.520]  We never even showed it because we're on TV stations and they don't want to I don't if you want to see it
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:41.240]  You can see it. We only showed still shots and him coming up to the building
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:48.080]  So we've been censored by this. You're a lawyer as well constitutional lawyer Bob Barr. What do you make of this?
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:50.080]  It's it's very bizarre
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:59.080]  But it makes me proud every day that I'm an American and thankful every day for our founding fathers who had the prescience and the
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:05.080]  understanding of government to incorporate in our Constitution our bill of rights
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:10.080]  You know the poor people of New Zealand don't have that kind of protection
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:15.080]  So the government in New Zealand can come in and the aftermath of a horrific
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:21.320]  Mass shooting such as occurred a week or a week and a half ago and say well
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:29.080]  We're going to ban all of the types of firearms like the one that the shooter used that simply because the shooter used it and
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.480]  Secondly, this is the bizarre part of it that you just mentioned
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:34.960]  They now are making it
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:40.040]  unlawful for a person in New Zealand not only to
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:45.200]  Show the footage that free that preceded the of the shooter's activities
[01:49:45.400 --> 01:49:49.080]  But you cannot even possess or transmit
[01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:56.320]  electronically or in hard copy a copy of the so-called manifesto that this that this murderer put out
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:04.600]  So, you know the only way that you can get around it is you have to petition the government for an exemption in order to
[01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:11.160]  Consess a piece of paper so so this is incredible banning of books. I mean we have Hitler's manifesto my struggle
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:15.720]  No one goes to jail for that and it doesn't mean you agree with Hitler if you read it. This is really dangerous
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:24.360]  It's it's dangerous also because it removes from the arena of experts an ability to study
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:32.080]  What went on perhaps in this murderer's mind? What led him to this in an effort for example to
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:37.000]  Try and prevent such a thing from happening by somebody else. No, you're right
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:41.100]  It kills what law enforcement admits it solves a lot of crimes is crowd sourcing
[01:50:41.480 --> 01:50:48.120]  Clues like the police come to the public and say help us. This is what the killer said it kills that the the the crowd sourcing
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:54.920]  Exactly they have in New Zealand and I didn't know this until I looked into this just recently in the wake of
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:59.760]  these these efforts that the government down there is engaging in they have a
[01:50:59.760 --> 01:51:02.600]  Sensor and the person
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:09.640]  His job. I don't know whether it's his or her job in the New Zealand government is to be the official sensor
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:16.480]  and they made this decision to ban the possession or transmittal of this so-called manifesto
[01:51:16.960 --> 01:51:24.360]  It really raises you know another another book that I'm sure you remember. Well a Fahrenheit was 451. Yeah
[01:51:25.040 --> 01:51:26.920]  the you know the book by
[01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:31.440]  Roddenberry was Ray Bradbury was a Ray Bradbury Bradbury
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:38.880]  About in the future that's the temperature paper burns and the government's going around destroying books. It's here
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:45.800]  It certainly is and thank goodness for our founding fathers that incorporated the bill of rights in our Constitution
[01:51:46.480 --> 01:51:51.560]  But as you know big tech is following the lead and if you even show
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:56.680]  The manifesto on air they ban your videos. I we've had it happen on Twitter and YouTube
[01:51:58.440 --> 01:52:00.400]  Mr. Bar it's
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:06.480]  Bizarre Alex one that the government would have this kind of power secondly that they would exercise it
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:11.000]  But thirdly that they would exercise it over simply a document
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:16.360]  That could provide clues for people to prevent a future shooting
[01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:19.680]  It's you like you said that's the president to ban books
[01:52:19.680 --> 01:52:23.760]  I'm getting into the final equation here the time we have left
[01:52:24.120 --> 01:52:31.280]  You've been a leader worrying about China and its infiltration the US the Confucian societies our military using the same platforms as them
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:36.360]  They're stealing our our data our big tech companies working with them giving them key data keys
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:41.040]  Let's play the whole clip. This is Secretary of Defense and then the Joint Chief Stumford
[01:52:41.400 --> 01:52:46.000]  Basically saying that Google is moving to China working on AI with them, but not the Pentagon
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:48.360]  Breaking contracts with the Pentagon here it is
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:50.560]  let me just
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.560]  shift and ask about
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:53:00.040]  Our challenge in emerging technologies cyber and space in particular China's investment in those areas and our
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:03.000]  eroding advantage. I was struck
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:07.880]  Mr. Secretary by a comment that you make in your written testimony
[01:53:08.160 --> 01:53:16.200]  You say some US companies have voiced ethical qualms about working with DOD to develop advanced technology in some cases even terminating
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:21.720]  Relationships often while continuing to work with China. What are we talking about here?
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.800]  I think we're talking about Google and
[01:53:25.920 --> 01:53:27.920]  their support to China and
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:30.680]  Their lack of supports the Department of Defense
[01:53:31.480 --> 01:53:36.880]  So Google has refused to work with the Department of Defense actually was under contract
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:42.920]  weren't they with the Department of Defense tells about that they haven't refused they just have said they're not going to continue to do business with
[01:53:42.920 --> 01:53:49.160]  The Department of Defense on certain contracts, but they are doing business in China in a way that benefits
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.360]  You're saying our Chinese competitors. Correct. They say more about that
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:55.480]  well the
[01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:57.240]  interesting thing and this is
[01:53:57.240 --> 01:54:01.400]  Why China is this is such an important issue for our country?
[01:54:01.800 --> 01:54:05.800]  You know this the fusion of commercial business
[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:08.560]  with military is
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.240]  significant
[01:54:10.240 --> 01:54:16.160]  Five billion dollars of five trillion dollars of their economy is state-owned enterprises
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:20.480]  So the technology that is developed in the civil world
[01:54:21.680 --> 01:54:23.680]  transfers to the military world
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.200]  It's a direct pipeline
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:30.240]  Not only is there a transfer. There's also
[01:54:30.240 --> 01:54:39.560]  Systemic theft of US technology that also that facilitates even faster development of emerging technology
[01:54:40.320 --> 01:54:44.120]  So I just want to make sure that I understand exactly what you're saying
[01:54:44.120 --> 01:54:47.640]  You're telling me that Google an American company supposedly is
[01:54:49.000 --> 01:54:51.600]  Refusing to work with the Department of Defense
[01:54:51.600 --> 01:54:59.360]  But is doing work in China with China in China in a way that at least indirectly benefits the China no, they're building the AI I
[01:55:00.440 --> 01:55:03.680]  Haven't heard the word refuse, but there's a lack of willingness
[01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:09.400]  To support DoD programs general you're nodding your head. Do you want to weigh in on this?
[01:55:09.960 --> 01:55:16.320]  No, sir. I'm nodding your head on exactly the point that you made that the the work that Google is doing in China is
[01:55:16.600 --> 01:55:18.600]  direct is indirectly
[01:55:18.600 --> 01:55:20.600]  benefiting the Chinese military and
[01:55:20.600 --> 01:55:24.080]  In and I've been very public on this issue as well
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:29.440]  In fact the way I described it to our industry partners is look with a good guess in the in the
[01:55:29.880 --> 01:55:37.160]  values that we represent in the in the system that we represent is the one that will allow and has allowed you to thrive and
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:41.680]  And that's the way I've characterized. So I I was just nodding that what the secretary was
[01:55:41.920 --> 01:55:48.280]  Articulating is a general sense of all of us as leaders and we watch with great concern when industry partners work in China
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.600]  Knowing that there is that indirect benefit in fact frankly indirect may be
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:58.520]  Maybe not a full character. They see how it really is. It's more of a direct benefit to the Chinese military
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:04.080]  Yeah, so just the time we have former Congress from Bob Barr. You've been on this for decades. What's really happening here?
[01:56:05.120 --> 01:56:11.160]  What's happening here is a continuation as you said just a moment ago of a very disturbing trend
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:13.760]  that the Chinese government
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:14.880]  uses
[01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:19.160]  commercial transactions and the openness of our system to
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:26.920]  Steal and then replicate in many respects military technology to its benefit and our detriment
[01:56:27.040 --> 01:56:31.560]  You know, this is nothing new. Well, we saw with the during the Clinton administration
[01:56:31.720 --> 01:56:37.640]  This was actually one of the the bases for my initial interest and press for impeachment
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:40.240]  in the Clinton administration
[01:56:41.280 --> 01:56:43.800]  because the Clinton administration now
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:50.920]  facilitated that providing so-called dual use technology that is technology that has post civilian and military
[01:56:51.880 --> 01:56:53.880]  ramifications to China
[01:56:54.000 --> 01:57:00.520]  By US companies and in return now was getting a campaign money from China these so-called morale
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:08.320]  Scandal so this thing going on for a long time and it's finally it's good to see an
[01:57:08.320 --> 01:57:14.720]  administration the current administration as we just saw with the tech deaf and the joint chiefs of staff there
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.800]  Chairman that this administration is finally

[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:59.000]  Info wars is truly the tip of the spear of the zeitgeist
[01:58:59.280 --> 01:59:03.880]  That's what a globalist are obsessed with it trying to shut it down. I didn't invent all this
[01:59:03.880 --> 01:59:05.880]  I went and researched the Renaissance
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:11.400]  Americana and what really works for humanity and I'm simply trying to bring it back and lo and behold
[01:59:11.400 --> 01:59:13.640]  It's super popular like it's always been
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:17.440]  That's why the globalists are trying to shut it down so desperately
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:22.120]  Because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills up my spine
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:28.240]  So whatever you do continue to support yourself and info wars by buying the great products and info store com

[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:46.520]  You are the info war and I salute you
[01:59:46.520 --> 01:59:53.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:00:04.600 --> 02:00:06.600]  Alex Jones here back live
[02:00:07.440 --> 02:00:13.640]  Congressman former CIA officer Patriot lawyer Bob bars our guests every guard or whether it's a second amendment or fourth amendment
[02:00:13.640 --> 02:00:19.480]  He's on top of it. So you just saw that dramatic footage of the chairman of the joint chiefs and the secretary of defense
[02:00:20.240 --> 02:00:21.760]  and
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:29.400]  You saw Dumford go well actually this is not indirect like the congressman said it's direct the Pentagon complain is it's AI and
[02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:32.480]  Then the Chinese brag it's now on board autonomous drones
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.240]  so
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:37.600]  Say what you want about the Pentagon having autonomous drones
[02:00:38.440 --> 02:00:40.440]  China gets it
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:46.760]  What do you think needs to be done about this because Obama obviously in the CFR they're all about the Chinese century
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:52.640]  They said that's it Lorel Hughes the sellout the Chinese generals bags of cash back in 95 that you exposed
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:55.640]  You know at the White House. I mean we're seeing
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:01:01.200]  The children of that project for now. It's just like China can do whatever it wants
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:04.240]  The
[02:01:04.240 --> 02:01:12.400]  The first step has been taken and that is the footage that you showed the this administration the Trump administration is highlighting the problem
[02:01:12.920 --> 02:01:22.520]  With dealing with China and having US companies that deal with China and serve as or at least facilitate a pipeline of the transfer of military
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:30.320]  Technology from the United States to China the Trump administration that least is shining a light on this unlike prior
[02:01:30.320 --> 02:01:34.120]  Administration or the Clinton administration going back 20 25 years
[02:01:34.640 --> 02:01:36.640]  But a lot more needs to be done
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:45.200]  We need to not simply enforce our laws against the export of so-called dual-use technology to China
[02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:48.600]  But we need to start taking steps against
[02:01:49.000 --> 02:01:54.720]  Companies that are engaging in that and facilitating it our nation's national security arms
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:02:01.000]  Well, I mean Roosevelt if we had US companies that did some of the Nazis. He just nationalized them and I'm not a police state guy
[02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:07.080]  But we have US companies aiding China to sell us out. I mean, I think the real response here is in guiding these people
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:11.960]  It I think that that certainly should not be taken off the table
[02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:15.040]  There are a lot of things that the administration can do
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:21.560]  Some of which have to do with the Department of Justice and both civil or criminal actions
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:25.080]  Also the Department of Defense and the Department of State
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:30.240]  Which oftentimes sort of rolls over and plays dead whenever an important issue comes up
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:32.400]  but I think we do have with the
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:38.880]  Acting Secretary of Defense don't use the staff. No, you're right. There's a consensus. There's a problem in closing
[02:02:39.480 --> 02:02:43.080]  Censorship, what do you think the president should do about that? Do we deal with universities?
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:49.640]  Say US government contracts to big tech if you censor people we're going to pull your contracts like he's saying with universities
[02:02:49.640 --> 02:02:56.440]  The the federal dollars should not be going to universities that allow
[02:02:57.200 --> 02:02:59.200]  Censorship or that allow and permit
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:05.760]  The use of the disruptive and sometimes violent tactics against those on the right
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:10.080]  And what about duplicating that to big tech getting US government dollars?
[02:03:10.080 --> 02:03:14.640]  Have you made the chai comms or you engage in censorship is proven then you don't get US money?
[02:03:14.640 --> 02:03:16.640]  I think that would end this overnight
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:22.640]  That that is one avenue my concern is to more directly attack the
[02:03:23.080 --> 02:03:30.800]  Way US companies and foreign companies that deal with and are permitted to work within the United States and conduct
[02:03:30.800 --> 02:03:34.280]  You're saying no technology transfers like you said when you were in Congress
[02:03:35.600 --> 02:03:40.240]  Absolutely and to enforce the laws that are already on the books to stop it
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:47.000]  Yeah, if you or I transferred to anybody some secret thing developed by DARPA used by US company. We'd be arrested
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.000]  That's why I'm just asking how can they do this?
[02:03:50.520 --> 02:03:53.600]  They do it because our government has not in the past
[02:03:53.600 --> 02:03:59.600]  I had the backbone to stand up to it and they're more concerned with allowing companies to make a dollar in China
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:05.760]  Than they are with protecting our nation's national defense. That's it a short-term vision versus the chai comm long-term vision
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:10.560]  They do look at it in the long term and very often more often than not
[02:04:10.680 --> 02:04:17.120]  We don't and that's why in the long run there are more dangerous. Well, thank God our forefathers as you said at a long-term view
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:22.040]  They were they were right then and they're right now
[02:04:22.040 --> 02:04:24.960]  We cannot allow the left to undermine our bill of rights
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:29.520]  Isn't it crazy how their amazing vision of 240 years is still saving us today?
[02:04:29.880 --> 02:04:34.840]  Their long-term vision counters the communist vision and defeats it even though we're idiots today
[02:04:34.840 --> 02:04:38.960]  Former Congresswoman Bob Bar, Liberty Guard dot org. We salute you. Thank you so much, sir
[02:04:39.800 --> 02:04:43.320]  Yes, sir. Take care. Wow powerful interview man
[02:04:43.720 --> 02:04:44.280]  All right
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:49.320]  We're gonna come back with open phones the next hour and a bunch of other just small it is being let off because you know
[02:04:49.320 --> 02:04:54.600]  Obama's behind all this defectors investigation of that. It's all coming up. Good Lord. This is insane. Stay with us
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:05:02.920]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama can be found here in Lelani estates
[02:05:02.920 --> 02:05:09.120]  But a lot of us on the big island rely on rain water and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain
[02:05:09.760 --> 02:05:17.720]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:20.840]  We employ the series of tests for heavy metals
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:28.440]  Alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater
[02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:36.120]  Next we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[02:05:36.360 --> 02:05:44.920]  But the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water
[02:05:45.280 --> 02:05:50.600]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:59.120]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:14.560]  Resistance to tyrants
[02:06:14.560 --> 02:06:20.520]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:26.240]  You know, I learned some things this morning before I went on air
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:32.000]  That are pretty amazing and I'm not liberty to talk about it yet
[02:06:34.280 --> 02:06:39.800]  And I've been behaving myself to not blow up on air and did not start talking about it, but
[02:06:39.800 --> 02:06:46.240]  You know, you hit a point in your life where you're not arrogant and you're not on a power trip
[02:06:49.040 --> 02:06:56.120]  But you realize how dumb the average person is and how stupid and unaccomplished they are, but how arrogant they are
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:59.000]  And
[02:06:59.000 --> 02:07:02.360]  If anybody wonders why they try to shut this broadcast down
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:07.840]  It's because in the councils of government at the highest levels of other governments
[02:07:07.840 --> 02:07:12.360]  People turn into this broadcast and they say, how does this guy know this?
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:21.360]  Because the average person hasn't read a thousand books on history most PhDs in history haven't done that
[02:07:22.280 --> 02:07:27.520]  Or they're specialists in the Greeks or the Romans the Japanese or Mesoamerica
[02:07:27.520 --> 02:07:32.120]  You know, they've read a hundred books and they've written the book and it's all a bunch of
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:34.760]  puffery it's all a bunch of
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.480]  fopping posing
[02:07:38.520 --> 02:07:41.160]  preening fake intellectual stuff
[02:07:42.520 --> 02:07:48.640]  And I'm not up here like I'm the big catch me out and I'm the big alpha male. I'm looking for alpha males
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:56.880]  I see these you know former Delta Force guys and top Navy SEALs dev group SEAL team six guys on TV
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:08:00.200]  Talk about all the stuff they do and how badass they are and everything and
[02:08:00.200 --> 02:08:06.560]  They all got the perfect tattoos and the tan and the truck and they're all telling you and I'm like great
[02:08:06.560 --> 02:08:08.560]  We have we have please help me to beat the globalist
[02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:16.120]  I see all the intellectuals so-called people that write all the books and the professors and the average and just no one sees it as their role
[02:08:17.480 --> 02:08:20.000]  Not NFL quarterbacks not anyway
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:25.160]  It's my like Tom Brady came out against the new world order and now people that know I'm he's an anti-globalist
[02:08:25.160 --> 02:08:27.160]  He knows all about this stuff. You have a Tom Brady
[02:08:27.160 --> 02:08:31.400]  His wife worth is worth hundreds of millions of dollars. He's worth hundreds of millions dollars
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.280]  If a Tom Brady came out against the globalist stuff like that would defeat the globalist
[02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:39.760]  If we could ever get one of the big stars who made himself as a man on the field
[02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:45.680]  The system didn't believe in if he ever came out against it all like a Donald Trump. It became over, but he won't
[02:08:46.400 --> 02:08:49.400]  and it just really gets old that I
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:53.760]  Sit there and I know exactly what they're gonna do
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:09:00.240]  I know exactly how they're gonna do it and then I tell people and then I watch it happen exactly in slow motion like I know
[02:09:00.480 --> 02:09:02.480]  It's like groundhog day
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:10.280]  It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen but the average stupid man
[02:09:12.520 --> 02:09:19.520]  Isn't even that stupid like the average man is like in some dress-up thing like there's Superman or Spider-Man and
[02:09:19.520 --> 02:09:23.960]  And all they do is kiss other men's ass and they kiss their ass and then they
[02:09:24.560 --> 02:09:29.840]  They sit there and go along with each other with whatever the scam is and they don't even know how things work
[02:09:30.480 --> 02:09:32.480]  They just pretend they do
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:36.800]  I am so tired of it
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:43.880]  And so you'll like defer to these lesser men just to be nice to them you'll defer to them and
[02:09:43.880 --> 02:09:50.000]  I'm not doing it anymore. I'm coming after everybody. I
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:53.040]  can't sit here and
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:56.840]  Cuz I'm looking for superior people I
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:01.780]  Think Trump superior to me from what what I've seen Trump superior
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.640]  People like Bob Barr are very good men. They're they're top-like good man. I
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:13.680]  Look at all these other men and there's just not many I'm out there and
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:20.000]  By the way, I got kids. I love humanity. Do you think I'm happy that I'm superior
[02:10:21.000 --> 02:10:23.760]  To like 99.99% of other men
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:26.800]  That scares the hell out of me
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:29.680]  because I'm now my whole life I
[02:10:29.680 --> 02:10:35.040]  Thought people are like me I projected my intelligence onto them
[02:10:37.800 --> 02:10:43.320]  There's the good news and I'm not just saying this to kiss your butt as you're a listener or your reviewer you support us
[02:10:44.040 --> 02:10:49.360]  There are white men. There are black men. There are Hispanics Asian men. Most folks are mixed
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:55.600]  Who call into this show and stay incredibly astute piercing things that are true and
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:59.280]  And you're smarter than the average corporate executive
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:06.160]  The average corporate executive is put there because they follow a paradigm a controlled blinder weird
[02:11:07.800 --> 02:11:10.320]  Blueprint that they think protects them and
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:17.640]  They're incredibly weak. I don't call them effeminate because women are powerful. They can make babies. They're awesome
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:24.440]  Those are all that guys are feminine Tim Cook's not effeminate. Tim Cook is a evil dark. Yes, man to corruption and
[02:11:27.040 --> 02:11:32.480]  He's willing to do whatever it takes to suck on the rear end to calm his China. I
[02:11:36.520 --> 02:11:38.360]  Don't want to go off into some Tim Cook rant
[02:11:40.440 --> 02:11:42.440]  It's just at the end of the day
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:49.280]  You try to teach other men what what you've learned and almost every man
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:53.480]  I know other than the people that have been in this office for years of our respect
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:59.960]  They think you're showing off to them because that's what the average man does who's really a little boy
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:07.200]  They try to show off what they've got to you and so they think when you're like, hey, this is going on
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:13.960]  We gotta do something about it. They think you're like trying to be in charge. I'm already in charge. You dumbass the enemy knows it. I
[02:12:15.360 --> 02:12:22.520]  Don't need to lead you. I'm already way past leadership with people like you and it's not some power trip
[02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:25.080]  It's pathetic
[02:12:25.960 --> 02:12:29.720]  I've been thinking for 27 years 25 years on there
[02:12:29.720 --> 02:12:36.320]  That I was here to get the word out because there were all these men who'd hear it and do something about it
[02:12:38.000 --> 02:12:40.000]  And you know what
[02:12:40.080 --> 02:12:47.880]  Those men did something from New York to Missouri from Florida, Texas to California to Oregon to New Mexico
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:52.760]  To Utah and every point between and they were just regular men
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:13:00.560]  working at the car dealership or working at the restaurant or working on the farm or working in law enforcement or whatever it was that were
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:06.840]  Leading their lives and going out and getting a woman and having kids and paying taxes and living and taking care of their parents
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:12.920]  But that's the problem all the men went out and did what men do they build a family
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:19.280]  While above us all the little creepy crawlers all the little conformist all the little people that wanted to be in charge
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:25.520]  They went out and they got control of government and control of society and let me tell you something
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:32.640]  They can't be helped. I've been around them. You sit there and you give them the keys to victory
[02:13:33.440 --> 02:13:34.120]  and
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:42.200]  They think you're sabotaging them so that you can put them down to be on top of them even though you're miles above them
[02:13:42.200 --> 02:13:50.240]  Because all they'll do is sabotage you because they're chicken shit fuckers delay that
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:56.560]  Because they don't want to see the species rise beyond their capacity
[02:13:56.560 --> 02:14:02.160]  They don't want to see leaders a hundred times more powerful than them. They don't want to see the species unleash like I do
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:08.320]  They want to squat on top of people and keep them stupid and down so they can roll over them
[02:14:08.320 --> 02:14:13.960]  Well, you can say one damn thing about me at the end of my days. Hopefully coming in a long time from now
[02:14:13.960 --> 02:14:18.640]  Is that I never screwed anybody over didn't have it coming. I don't enjoy screwing people over
[02:14:18.640 --> 02:14:24.480]  I don't lie to people on purpose. I make mistakes sometimes. I'm genuine. I'm real. I love God
[02:14:24.480 --> 02:14:27.240]  I love my country. I love my children
[02:14:29.440 --> 02:14:31.040]  And
[02:14:31.040 --> 02:14:33.040]  I'm not gonna shit here anymore
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.400]  From now on when lesser men try their crap with me. I'm getting their face instantly
[02:14:40.240 --> 02:14:44.640]  What's crazy as soon as I do that they roll over they were looking for that
[02:14:45.320 --> 02:14:48.920]  The problem is there's so many cucks and so many betas in this culture
[02:14:49.480 --> 02:14:56.600]  Whose mouths are writing checks their ass can't cash and it's time for us to get aggressive and be men
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:03.200]  It's time to march into your church where they're preaching a bunch of candy-ass globalism and it's time to break that church up
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:05.520]  Because it's not a church if they don't get back on the straight and narrow
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:11.520]  It's time to go to every damn congressional meeting in your town every time because that's a football game, baby. That's a real war
[02:15:12.400 --> 02:15:16.400]  That's not going and watching the simulated football game. That's not a real war
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:25.520]  But you've got my commitment. I will stop looking at people in the system and building them up in my own vision
[02:15:26.600 --> 02:15:31.440]  Stop giving people the benefit of the doubt. The globalists don't believe in them. They've written them all off
[02:15:32.320 --> 02:15:37.360]  Stop believing in the globalists stop believing in all these people in the establishment. You have to be the leader now
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:39.640]  You have to do it
[02:15:39.640 --> 02:15:45.160]  Scares the hell out of me that out of this whole planet. I'm one of the best there is that's not a good thing
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:51.080]  We're in a lot of trouble folks if I'm one of the best people we've got think about that. We'll be back

[02:20:17.720 --> 02:20:22.560]  You know, there's a lot of news I haven't hit and I want to put the phones up on the Jesse Smollett situation
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:27.960]  And all the incredible activities that are happening on the whole Russia gate thing being a giant fraud
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:30.800]  Meanwhile mayor
[02:20:30.800 --> 02:20:36.840]  Ron Emanuel sides with police Smollett case a whitewash of justice. That's an infowars.com story
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:40.560]  A lot of political capital was just spent to drop Smollett's case
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:43.560]  Let's go bomb is involved
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:49.360]  Also reports Smollett's time served with community service was for another unrelated case
[02:20:49.720 --> 02:20:53.600]  That's all up at news wars.com a lot of stories are at news wars.com
[02:20:54.240 --> 02:20:59.400]  They're not at info wars.com. Let's go to the Chicago police superintendent
[02:21:00.040 --> 02:21:06.680]  Talking about what just happened with the open and shut case. They had being killed by a bunch of Obama minions. Here it is
[02:21:07.800 --> 02:21:09.800]  So listen
[02:21:09.800 --> 02:21:13.720]  I'm sure we all know what occurred this morning
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:18.840]  My personal opinion is that you all know where I stand
[02:21:20.320 --> 02:21:25.200]  Do I think justice will serve? No, what do I think justice is? I
[02:21:27.440 --> 02:21:29.800]  Think this city is still old and apology and
[02:21:30.480 --> 02:21:33.360]  Let me digress one more when I came on this job
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:36.800]  I've been a cop now for about 31 years and I came on this job
[02:21:36.800 --> 02:21:39.840]  I came on with my honor my integrity my reputation
[02:21:40.320 --> 02:21:42.920]  If someone accused me of doing anything
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:49.960]  That was circumvent that then I would want my day in court period to clear my name
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:56.200]  I've heard that they wanted their day in court with TV cameras so
[02:21:56.880 --> 02:22:02.240]  America could know the truth and though they chose to hide behind secrecy and broker a deal
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:10.080]  To circumvent the judicial system. My job as a police officer is to investigate an incident
[02:22:10.600 --> 02:22:17.560]  Gather evidence gather the facts and present them to the state's attorney. That's what we did. I stand behind the detectives investigation
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:22.840]  I'll let Mary Maddox kind of further
[02:22:23.880 --> 02:22:26.600]  But even Rahm Emanuel has to come out and say it's wrong
[02:22:27.240 --> 02:22:29.760]  because he's not gonna get burned for Obama and
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:34.960]  And and black lives matter and all this stuff that tried to stage this they the police have
[02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:41.960]  Both stores they went to surveillance footage the magazine that got up to put the letter threatening small at the first time
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  They have everything
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:52.840]  They have everything the check he gave them everything but they can't
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:55.920]  prosecuting
[02:22:55.920 --> 02:23:01.160]  Because the prosecutor works for Obama and the lawyers work for Obama and it's all in the news
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:06.240]  But they can't help but exercise the power in your face and
[02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:08.880]  Say he walks
[02:23:09.000 --> 02:23:11.160]  Nothing happens even the charge
[02:23:12.360 --> 02:23:16.280]  Disorderly conduct was a slap on the wrist, but now there can't even be that
[02:23:17.160 --> 02:23:23.440]  There's another article on news wars calm and culture Jesse Smollett prosecutor a George Soros puppet
[02:23:23.440 --> 02:23:28.640]  The article goes through all the evidence of the community organizing all of the course it failed
[02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:31.280]  You can't send him to jail cuz he'll talk
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:34.840]  So for the deep state there were two things
[02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:38.920]  Well three things I guess since Smollett off with a bunch of money in a
[02:23:40.360 --> 02:23:46.600]  Facelift or a face change to some other country or they could have killed him like Ron Barron the
[02:23:47.480 --> 02:23:50.640]  Commerce secretary that said if I go down I'll take the Clintons down with me or
[02:23:50.640 --> 02:23:55.240]  They could have let him go ahead and get tried and
[02:23:56.040 --> 02:23:58.040]  Expose all them for taking their orders
[02:23:58.320 --> 02:24:00.800]  Yeah, let's back that up play audio when he he cries
[02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:05.760]  He goes I can't believe anybody will question this and now he gets to run around and say it still happened
[02:24:07.240 --> 02:24:14.000]  But not broken and he's still processing the raw motions. Have you ever been threatened before? Yeah, I
[02:24:14.000 --> 02:24:22.120]  Get threatened all the time on Twitter and Instagram and DMs and things like that. It's like but you know
[02:24:22.920 --> 02:24:24.920]  I'm a public figure
[02:24:25.120 --> 02:24:27.120]  I'm
[02:24:27.120 --> 02:24:29.120]  very outspoken
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:32.320]  Sometimes maybe to
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:33.920]  outspoken
[02:24:33.920 --> 02:24:35.760]  But it's who I am
[02:24:35.760 --> 02:24:39.760]  You know, so I get the idea of pissing people off
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:48.200]  That you don't rub people the wrong way. In fact the week before the attack police confirm a letter was sent to the Fox studio in Chicago
[02:24:48.200 --> 02:24:51.520]  So folks you all remember this. He also says he beat the guy's asses
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:59.440]  So it just goes on and on and on and on
[02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:04.840]  Because people that are deceptive can't do anything but be deceptive. Here's the number to join us to give your take on this
[02:25:05.040 --> 02:25:07.720]  Your take on Trump we need to do against the censorship
[02:25:07.720 --> 02:25:13.720]  Where everything's going the whole rushing gate imploding. What's the Democrat station the whole it's election front
[02:25:14.840 --> 02:25:20.320]  So the toll free number to join us is 877-789 Alex 877-789-2539
[02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:23.040]  877-789-2539
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:28.040]  Is the number on these subjects to get into?
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:33.720]  Don't forget Mike Adams article up on info wars.com is so
[02:25:33.720 --> 02:25:39.520]  So critical they can't stop you from emailing it or text messaging it on their big censorship networks
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:44.680]  President Trump can end big tech censorship with a single signature. Here's how
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:49.200]  This is what they fear the show being on air is covering
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:54.880]  Just like he signed executive order saying the public universities don't people have free speech will pull your funding
[02:25:55.640 --> 02:26:01.920]  Anybody that gains a big tech censorship will have their federal funding pulled from US contracts
[02:26:01.920 --> 02:26:05.920]  It's over and that's how you defeat it
[02:26:06.920 --> 02:26:12.240]  President Trump can end big tech censorship with a single signature. Here's how
[02:26:13.640 --> 02:26:17.360]  Stories on info wars comm get it out to people
[02:26:18.520 --> 02:26:23.240]  Because we beat them trying to steal the election but barely and we beat them on their fake Russia gate
[02:26:23.240 --> 02:26:36.000]  but they are coming back ladies and gentlemen with election fraud and they got away with it in 2016 but
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:38.760]  Trump still won there was massive election fraud
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:45.960]  But he still won and they really got away with the 2018 and they won and the evidence is top computer science have exposed it
[02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:49.120]  Google and others gained it now
[02:26:49.120 --> 02:26:55.000]  We've got to stop them and we've got a year and a half to do it. So let's make it the buzz
[02:26:55.640 --> 02:27:00.360]  They're scared of your voice. They're scared of your speech. They're scared of what you say override them
[02:27:00.800 --> 02:27:08.320]  Break their will do it with signs in the streets or bumper stickers or calling it a talk radio. Just get the word out that it's on

[02:33:28.360 --> 02:33:30.360]  me
[02:33:52.360 --> 02:33:54.360]  Now we're gonna take some of your phone calls
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:58.360]  Paul Watts has taken over Mike Adams is popping in you've heard me talk a lot about his article
[02:33:58.480 --> 02:34:03.160]  What's up a natural news calm and news wars calm right now and it's simple
[02:34:03.840 --> 02:34:08.480]  We said before Trump did it. We said it after he did it with the universities. You don't
[02:34:09.200 --> 02:34:11.200]  Take action Trump we lose
[02:34:11.760 --> 02:34:14.440]  Yeah, okay. We got you elected despite all the fraud
[02:34:14.640 --> 02:34:19.960]  We got over that hurdle then we stopped the whole rushing a situation the American people did
[02:34:19.960 --> 02:34:25.600]  Now if you don't stop big tech censorship, it's naked in our face
[02:34:26.120 --> 02:34:30.600]  Then they're going to be able to seal the election in the top computer experts. They've all come out
[02:34:30.600 --> 02:34:33.120]  It's all over the news. They stole the 2018 election
[02:34:34.600 --> 02:34:37.800]  It's time to pull federal funding from big tech
[02:34:38.840 --> 02:34:43.600]  If they keep censoring it's that simple to the federal government spend money with
[02:34:43.600 --> 02:34:50.440]  Department complexes that don't let black people live there. No, well if these big tech companies engage in this
[02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:53.440]  Little get the money take action
[02:34:54.200 --> 02:35:00.400]  Problem is most of Congress has bought off by their lobbyists for the average of $4,000 per congressional term
[02:35:01.720 --> 02:35:03.960]  Something like $20,000 buys you a senator
[02:35:04.520 --> 02:35:06.080]  God almighty
[02:35:06.080 --> 02:35:10.960]  That's pathetic Mike Adams of natural news calm. Thanks for joining us a lot of good things happening
[02:35:10.960 --> 02:35:16.640]  A lot of bad things happening as well because like you said we can pull out of this very quickly if Trump takes action
[02:35:17.560 --> 02:35:23.560]  Well, Trump needs to in in essence go nuclear on big tech right now in my opinion
[02:35:23.560 --> 02:35:29.320]  He needs to take immediate action and the good news Alex is that he doesn't have to have Congress pass a new law
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:36.640]  Trump can sign an executive order as described in that article that simply denies all federal contracts federal funding or federal
[02:35:36.640 --> 02:35:42.080]  You know grants of any kind to these large tech platforms social media companies that are
[02:35:42.520 --> 02:35:48.000]  discriminating against American people based on the color of their ideas it is a
[02:35:48.880 --> 02:35:55.080]  violation of basic human dignity and human rights what these tech companies are doing they're also engaged in election
[02:35:55.400 --> 02:36:02.560]  Meddling they stole the 2018 election and they are now trying to steal the 2020 election and every election from this point forward
[02:36:02.560 --> 02:36:07.400]  Trump now has been vindicated the Russia collusion hoax has collapsed
[02:36:07.480 --> 02:36:13.280]  It's time for all of us to fight aggressively. We cannot allow this to lapse
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:16.200]  We cannot just say oh, it's time to move on forget what happened in the past
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:22.520]  No, the tech giants were complicit in trying to overthrow this country. They took part in a political coup
[02:36:22.640 --> 02:36:29.160]  They silenced the voices that were accurately reporting the truth that the Russia collusion hoax was a false narrative
[02:36:29.160 --> 02:36:34.240]  And yet we are still being silenced today Alex. We are being de-platformed without justification
[02:36:34.560 --> 02:36:39.320]  You know, I've been it's all being accelerated. I mean, there's it's getting worse every day
[02:36:39.320 --> 02:36:43.680]  It's out of control because the Congress is green lit this behavior
[02:36:44.320 --> 02:36:50.400]  And we are now entering a realm where with this Jesse Smollett decision today where Illinois
[02:36:50.400 --> 02:36:53.200]  You know corrupt Illinois officials have dropped charges against him
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:59.640]  I think a lot of Americans are asking right now. Are we now living in a lawless despotic?
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:04.960]  Authoritarian system where Democrats are never charged with anything or never
[02:37:05.520 --> 02:37:13.520]  Prosecuted for anything but conservatives are silenced and defamed and accused and criminalized for just doing their job
[02:37:13.520 --> 02:37:17.920]  There's no doubt that's going on and I'm not calling for anybody to take justice in their own hands
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:21.400]  But at a certain point that's where this is gonna go and since you mentioned that
[02:37:21.400 --> 02:37:27.960]  What do you make of Smollett and and and and Obama's lawyer and all his people about and federal investigations?
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:32.840]  Clearly, this was orchestrated. We have the evidence by higher-up Smollett didn't act alone
[02:37:32.840 --> 02:37:38.440]  But he did it in such a ham-fisted way and then Don Lemon just said oh, he wasn't good wasn't giving good advice
[02:37:38.480 --> 02:37:42.760]  He didn't carry it outright. His only crime was he didn't execute it correctly
[02:37:43.040 --> 02:37:49.040]  It's a very dangerous precedent because if you think about it the signal being sent now to other people who are considering
[02:37:49.040 --> 02:37:53.280]  Considering carrying out their own hate hoaxes that signals now go ahead
[02:37:53.280 --> 02:37:59.200]  You have full permission because you will never be prosecuted for carrying out a hate hoax crime in America
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:02.240]  You know the slogan for the Democrats for 2020 should be
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:07.320]  Democrats keep hate alive. They have to keep it alive with these hate hoaxes
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:11.480]  They have to spin their false narratives and make sure that their hoax is
[02:38:11.480 --> 02:38:15.200]  I don't want to make it about myself, but I went in Lucy's fried chicken Saturday night and
[02:38:15.200 --> 02:38:21.040]  And people came in size is mainly outdoor and so we're gonna get you f you we're gonna you're gonna get it
[02:38:21.040 --> 02:38:22.240]  And then we'd go outside
[02:38:22.240 --> 02:38:25.040]  We're waiting for me outside and then when I stood up to them
[02:38:25.040 --> 02:38:29.640]  They edited the tape to make it look like they were victims and reddit wouldn't let us post a raw video
[02:38:29.920 --> 02:38:33.160]  Showing they came after us first. They would only show the edited video
[02:38:33.160 --> 02:38:36.760]  I mean just a collusion of big tech and these people is incredible
[02:38:37.320 --> 02:38:43.920]  Everything that Democrats and these lunatic leftists are doing is a fraud everything is a fraud when they run elections
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:49.940]  The elections are a fraud when they run tech companies the tech companies are a fraud when they try to extort
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:55.480]  Nike right that it's another form of criminal fraud when they run hate crime hoaxes, of course
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:00.520]  It's a fraud everything they run is a fraud because they can't win in the free market of ideas
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:07.400]  They can't win in an environment where intelligent informed conservative Americans have the free speech right to simply
[02:39:07.640 --> 02:39:10.680]  debate and engage if we can simply
[02:39:10.680 --> 02:39:16.760]  Engage in debate we will win and that's why they have to silence us because all the ideas of the left are
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:24.440]  Their disasters they destroy societies and you think about things being pushed now the lawlessness that we already talked about
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:27.960]  But also like the Green New Deal and other things this would destroy
[02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:34.360]  Society this would lead to mass starvation a collapse of the food supply a collapse of the US economy
[02:39:34.360 --> 02:39:39.560]  And they combine that with open borders and wanting to flood our country with illegal voters
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:43.720]  And then have the popular vote determine the election these people have to be stopped
[02:39:43.720 --> 02:39:49.840]  They are so dangerous to the future of our society. That's why I say again Trump needs to quote go nuclear
[02:39:49.840 --> 02:39:55.080]  I don't mean nuclear weapons. I just mean he needs to get aggressive right now on the left the time to do it
[02:39:55.080 --> 02:39:58.320]  Is now it's now or never or we lose America forever more
[02:39:58.320 --> 02:40:02.000]  Yeah, because you're not swallowing well that said we'll use nuclear weapons to take the guns
[02:40:02.000 --> 02:40:08.000]  You're saying nuclear option is that he needs to just do the right thing and the default
[02:40:08.000 --> 02:40:13.520]  I have a nuclear option is to take their funding away and stop greenlighting their behavior because all of this giving into big tech
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:17.040]  Like their God has created this atmosphere and this perfect storm
[02:40:17.280 --> 02:40:23.440]  Let's talk to Doug retired police officer and vet on Jesse Smollett charges being dropped from Connecticut. What's your take on this?
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.000]  Hey, I'll say my pleasure to talk to you both
[02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:33.160]  Well when I was a cop Alex, I was a cop for 15 years. I got pensions off early because I was attacked once but
[02:40:33.160 --> 02:40:36.880]  Uh, you know how laws are different from state to state
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:40.700]  Are you there brother? Yes, I'm there. I'm sorry
[02:40:41.080 --> 02:40:44.560]  Laws are different from state to state. So when I was a cop in some of the high schools here
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:48.960]  If you pull the fire alarm, that was a felony. I was one of the lower felonies
[02:40:48.960 --> 02:40:52.800]  But it was still a felony because if you pulled it and people were running out of bills
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:56.560]  It could break their legs. It took the fire department away from other real fires
[02:40:56.960 --> 02:41:01.280]  Right. These kids were yanking a fire alarm seven days a week or seven times a day sometimes so
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:02.680]  I
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:08.200]  Have no respect for evil people, but I thought to be evil at a master level like they are
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:15.120]  I thought you had to be somewhat smart, but to let this dude off with nothing is the dumbest thing I've ever seen and
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:22.840]  What kind of fire alarm did he pull he could have started a freaking race for and let's face it when something kicks off in the United States
[02:41:22.840 --> 02:41:25.280]  I know people from like England and France with the yellow vest
[02:41:25.440 --> 02:41:30.440]  They're like what the hell America we see you guys in the videos with your guns, but you don't do shit about anything in a cup
[02:41:30.440 --> 02:41:33.720]  I'm sorry, you know anything in your country about what's going on with all your guns
[02:41:33.720 --> 02:41:40.120]  But because if something kicks off with us in this country, it's gonna smolder and fire. You know what I mean
[02:41:40.560 --> 02:41:46.160]  But we don't want to go there Doug, but I but I hear what you're saying is that we have we have the red-handed
[02:41:47.040 --> 02:41:51.680]  People caught staging it and nothing's being done and it's really gonna discredit the system
[02:41:51.680 --> 02:41:52.800]  How does it they're getting away with it?
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:42:00.600]  They have to because the evidence mounts that the Democrats and Obama were involved and Smollett was just an actor as he is in a
[02:42:00.600 --> 02:42:08.160]  Larger production. Thank you for the call Mike Adams public trust is collapsing in every institution Alex who trusts the FBI ever again
[02:42:08.160 --> 02:42:14.680]  Who trusts the media no informed person trust the media who you know who trusts the Democrat Party?
[02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:17.840]  No, no reasonable informed person if the DOJ
[02:42:17.840 --> 02:42:25.280]  DOJ doesn't prosecute this corruption in Chicago over the Smollett case then we are living in a lawless society
[02:42:25.280 --> 02:42:32.960]  So I hope the president Trump is going to order William Barr to order an investigation of the state of Illinois and this obvious cover-up
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:37.960]  And this obvious corruption otherwise we do not have the rule of law in effect in America
[02:42:37.960 --> 02:42:41.120]  I think we don't have that color said that Mike is there's this is crazy
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:47.260]  This only brings more attention on Smollett even worse than having a trial will come back with Mike Adams and more calls
[02:42:47.260 --> 02:42:51.160]  We talk about Smollett. We talk about the election coming up
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:53.960]  The Trump doesn't take action. He's gonna lose
[02:42:54.880 --> 02:43:00.440]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made

[02:43:54.760 --> 02:43:58.320]  I've been doing a lot of research into Google and YouTube
[02:43:58.880 --> 02:44:07.400]  Censorship and I've noticed that there's one type of video that is the most censored the most buried the most suppressed
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:14.380]  And that's the videos where you saw in 2016 election night all the arrogant
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:19.680]  Leftist authoritarians like the young turds and others get so butt-hurt when Trump won
[02:44:20.640 --> 02:44:25.600]  They don't want us to have that victory. They don't want us to remember what political action did
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:30.720]  And that's why the globalist Hillary and others are trying to shut in for us now
[02:44:30.720 --> 02:44:37.520]  This is a fight about taking your speech away. Not just my speech about taking your very sovereignty away
[02:44:37.520 --> 02:44:39.520]  This country is in a war

[02:46:55.320 --> 02:47:05.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[02:47:14.640 --> 02:47:18.360]  In Nazi Germany, they began killing babies after they were born
[02:47:18.360 --> 02:47:26.160]  They began forced inoculations of the poor they would add chemicals to induce coma or sterilization
[02:47:28.480 --> 02:47:30.480]  Then of course we had
[02:47:30.560 --> 02:47:34.640]  Not just the blacks injected with syphilis, but have in all the world of the Suzuki experiment
[02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:40.320]  Well, now you've seen giant corporate hype after I was banned from the internet other than our own platforms
[02:47:40.320 --> 02:47:48.200]  You saw anyone questioning vaccines including medical doctors people showing the inserts the vaccines saying it can really hurt you
[02:47:49.320 --> 02:47:55.160]  And now in New York, they declared a civil emergency. That means martial law
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:00.320]  Anyone quote under 18 to be in public places the police are gonna be out
[02:48:00.600 --> 02:48:05.960]  Take your vaccine and they go. Oh seven people died. They don't tell you that from California, New York
[02:48:05.960 --> 02:48:11.520]  They're shipping an unlimited numbers of illegal aliens and not testing any of them. Then when somebody dies of
[02:48:12.440 --> 02:48:14.440]  TB or whatever is they go? Oh
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:20.680]  It's the measles. Oh, it's smallpox. Here's Fox News just minutes ago with the national alert
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:28.360]  And all the world in New York declares a state of emergency when it comes to the ongoing measles outbreak Rockland County officials say as of tomorrow
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:35.600]  Anyone under 18 years old and unvaccinated against the measles will be barred from public places until this declaration
[02:48:35.600 --> 02:48:41.720]  Expires in 30 days. Brian Yenis is live in Rockland County. This is a significant step, Brian
[02:48:43.520 --> 02:48:49.840]  It is a significant step Dana in fact it is historic Rockland County, New York has become the first county to ban
[02:48:50.240 --> 02:48:57.840]  People who are unvaccinated with the measles vaccination from all public places all people who are under the age of 18
[02:48:57.840 --> 02:49:00.560]  That's all children are now banned from schools
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:09.440]  Churches synagogues no grocery stores restaurants. They cannot be in these places unless they are vaccinated with the measles vaccine
[02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:13.120]  This state of emergency will be in place for the next 30 days. Listen
[02:49:14.400 --> 02:49:17.120]  Last year not just one but seven
[02:49:17.800 --> 02:49:23.600]  Unvaccinated travelers diagnosed with measles answered our county between October 1st October 17
[02:49:23.600 --> 02:49:34.320]  Leads to 153 confirmed cases and this is the longest outbreak in the u.s. Due to measles since the disease was officially eradicated in 2000
[02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:38.520]  Dana back to you. All right, Brian
[02:49:38.600 --> 02:49:41.160]  Okay, so big pharma has vaccine protection
[02:49:41.840 --> 02:49:45.880]  Billions of the secret fund. They give us deadly Gardasil that killed thousands of people
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:52.840]  They're doing all this Mike Adams. I mean this is really war. This is government saying we're gonna put now
[02:49:52.840 --> 02:49:58.600]  They want 60 plus vaccines be mandatory in you. We don't care. We've gone from 135,000 with autism and 158
[02:49:58.760 --> 02:50:06.000]  We're going to do it. You know, they've got the huge propaganda situation going the same Democrats want to abort babies after they're born
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:10.920]  They they want to kill it. They said there's too many humans, but now they love us and want to save us
[02:50:11.840 --> 02:50:14.400]  This is medical martial law Alex
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:21.520]  I'm glad you're covering this important development because now this is setting people up to have to carry vaccine
[02:50:21.520 --> 02:50:27.080]  Mandate records and cards with them. Show me your vaccine papers
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:32.880]  You're gonna have to be embedded with an RFID chip or there'll be a biometric scan of your iris
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:39.880]  Which will be linked to your medical records. This is medical mark of the beast and it is now official today
[02:50:39.880 --> 02:50:45.000]  I mean, you know, remember five years ago. We said this was coming you and I both we talked about this repeatedly
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:47.000]  And of course we were mocked at the time
[02:50:47.000 --> 02:50:52.280]  But today it's here. They just announced it this morning in New York and it's a pilot case
[02:50:52.280 --> 02:50:53.120]  This is a test case
[02:50:53.120 --> 02:50:56.200]  They're gonna see if they can spread it nationwide and one more important thing Alex
[02:50:56.640 --> 02:51:03.200]  Recognize that it is Adam Schiff the same liar and a hoaxer who pushed the Russia collusion hoax
[02:51:03.320 --> 02:51:09.560]  He's the guy who has been sending out demand letters to the tech companies to say that you must censor vaccine
[02:51:09.720 --> 02:51:13.000]  Awareness information and that's why Facebook has banned it
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:18.480]  That's why Amazon pulled the vaxed documentary off Amazon Prime and so on this one guy
[02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:21.920]  Who is in my view an unindicted criminal?
[02:51:22.480 --> 02:51:28.720]  Conspirator he's a he's a traitor to America. Oh, he's a man for harm of the devil. He is just unbelievably evil
[02:51:29.160 --> 02:51:32.240]  And he is rolling out essentially with his influence
[02:51:32.240 --> 02:51:36.960]  He's rolling out a medical police state across America. It is active right now
[02:51:36.960 --> 02:51:41.640]  We are becoming China in terms of censorship and in terms of the medical
[02:51:41.640 --> 02:51:47.400]  You know gunpoint enforcement. They're denying these children the right to go to school. They're right. Let's roll the shot
[02:51:48.040 --> 02:51:49.480]  Some of my one of my daughters
[02:51:49.480 --> 02:51:52.160]  It's made fun of at school because she's Alex Jones's daughter and had the shot
[02:51:52.160 --> 02:51:57.680]  They say we're gonna get sick because you haven't had it. They've already supposedly taken it. They're already supposedly protected
[02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:03.400]  It's all made up. But but exactly let's pull back from this. They use the gravitas of foreign powers
[02:52:04.000 --> 02:52:10.040]  Seizing our election to build this up and how they've part late it that Schiff gives the orders to the media of what to ban
[02:52:10.040 --> 02:52:14.080]  And what to do now to vaccines. So now they've part laid this hysteria
[02:52:14.720 --> 02:52:19.600]  Into everything and it is martial law Mike. They've really set this up
[02:52:19.920 --> 02:52:27.240]  And think about this if you are a child who who were you were exposed to measles naturally and you overcame measles
[02:52:27.240 --> 02:52:32.920]  So you have antibodies against measles because maybe you were homeschooled and your parents didn't want to kill you with vaccines
[02:52:32.920 --> 02:52:35.640]  So now you have antibodies but according to this rule
[02:52:35.640 --> 02:52:41.400]  You still have to be vaccinated even though you cannot be infected with measles because you've already had let's expand on that
[02:52:41.400 --> 02:52:45.640]  It's what they're adding to the vaccines one of my daughters was to the other was like five
[02:52:45.960 --> 02:52:51.300]  And they both got the measles a few spots on their faces. It was over and even the governor of Kentucky said big deal
[02:52:51.400 --> 02:52:53.160]  This is not like
[02:52:53.160 --> 02:52:58.960]  Drug-resistant TB that they let the illegals come in and spread it's it's crazy and most of this is being spread by illegals
[02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:02.200]  They admit that yeah, well even even in that video clip
[02:53:02.200 --> 02:53:07.840]  They said it was travelers who came into the state probably from overseas now think about this the left today
[02:53:08.080 --> 02:53:11.640]  Says that the open border is not an emergency
[02:53:11.640 --> 02:53:17.000]  But they say unvaccinated American kids in New York are a declared emergency now
[02:53:17.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  I mean where have they lost their minds? You know, of course they have but they're gonna roll out this medical police state and medical
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:25.800]  Martial law it's gonna be gunpoint enforced
[02:53:25.800 --> 02:53:32.960]  Vaccines nationwide and it's going to be complete de-platforming of anyone who questions the vaccine narrative
[02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:39.560]  Even those who talk about the ingredients that are admitted to be in the vaccines you and I both know it's the ingredients
[02:53:39.560 --> 02:53:43.480]  It's the aluminum adjuvant. It's the squalene. It's the mercury. It's the MSG
[02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:47.160]  It's all these other things that are they wouldn't have given big pharma
[02:53:47.760 --> 02:53:53.440]  Coverage and liability protection. There's a covert binary program going on just like the GMO everything
[02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:59.360]  There's a larger project going on and they're pissed because more and more people get it all the worlds. They're creating these hoaxes
[02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:08.000]  And and and bullying everybody and it's incredibly obvious people aren't stupid Mike Adams incredible job. God bless you
[02:54:08.080 --> 02:54:12.560]  Thank you for spending time with us. You're welcome any time in studio. Thank you, Alex. We'll see you soon
[02:54:12.960 --> 02:54:18.440]  All right, look, I need to go to your calls. I need to go to Dennis Harry Debbie Dean Jim Luke Ray and others
[02:54:18.440 --> 02:54:20.960]  We got Paul Watson coming up, but please remember
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:28.640]  We're fighting around the clock to warn people on every front and without your prayers and not your support
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:35.680]  Financially buying the products which are great. You need anyways to the shop with the good guys easy decision to make please make it
[02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:38.640]  I'm asking you for yourself and for myself for everybody
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:43.320]  But also that word of mouth your text message your email your person to person
[02:54:43.320 --> 02:54:46.560]  Hey, you've heard about info wars. You've heard about Alex Jones. You've heard him demonized, right?
[02:54:47.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  How would you ever wanted to go here?
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:51.480]  What is so evil? What's so bad?
[02:54:52.720 --> 02:54:56.320]  Because when you actually hear what we're saying it's different than what you're hearing on the national news
[02:54:56.320 --> 02:55:01.440]  So that's how we defeat the enemy and we've survived even prospered in some areas. Thanks to you
[02:55:01.440 --> 02:55:07.960]  So I'm in your hands. You're in my hands. We're in this together store-wide free shipping 50% off the nutraceuticals
[02:55:07.960 --> 02:55:13.560]  Some as high as 60% off books videos t-shirts films non-geoma or heirloom seeds. I mean seeds that
[02:55:13.560 --> 02:55:20.600]  You plant them and then they grow more seeds that grow more plants and it's a cycle forever like men and women
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:24.560]  It's yes some day they're actually trying
[02:55:24.960 --> 02:55:30.040]  Monsanto says their goals have no seeds that can produce more seeds that it'll be a conspiracy one day
[02:55:30.040 --> 02:55:35.360]  I heard used to plants grew from seeds that they had no. Oh, that's a right-wing lie. I
[02:55:35.360 --> 02:55:42.720]  Heard one time that women gave birth vaginally or they had their breasts were from giving milk. Oh, there's no genders
[02:55:43.680 --> 02:55:48.040]  The goals to say there's a thousand genders till there's no gender. This is the plan
[02:55:48.040 --> 02:55:51.800]  So when you commit what you've done and I salute you and I thank you
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:58.240]  When you commit and say I need high quality for sure. I need good coffee. I need high quality protein bars need high quality
[02:55:59.160 --> 02:56:04.120]  Nutraceuticals, you know, brain force a boost when I need it turbo force X to the good halogen
[02:56:04.120 --> 02:56:06.120]  Everybody needs back in stock
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.720]  And when you just go to him for work store.com and
[02:56:09.760 --> 02:56:13.960]  You purchase it you sound for auto ships. You don't forget so next month you get 10% off
[02:56:14.720 --> 02:56:18.960]  You ties of the operation and then I can fight these bastards and not back down
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:24.240]  Instead of spending most of my time scrabble and around trying to get funding. I want to hire a lot of the reporters
[02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:28.000]  I want to watch a lot of big projects and it's a miracle or even still here at this level
[02:56:28.000 --> 02:56:33.720]  But I want to expand in the face of the enemy and we're right there at that event horizon of expanding or contracting
[02:56:33.720 --> 02:56:39.720]  We're right there. You've got to push yourself because we're together into this next level in four store.com
[02:56:39.960 --> 02:56:44.640]  Or triple eight two five three three one three nine the mailing address on the website, but
[02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:54.440]  The enemy is cheating. They're letting criminals go free like small it. They're doing it all because they're desperate. They're losing
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:56:57.000]  their losers and
[02:56:57.560 --> 02:57:01.760]  They thought we'd all given up or gone away by now. We're never giving up
[02:57:01.760 --> 02:57:05.360]  In fact, we got a lot of tricks up our sleeves and
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:10.760]  It's the end of the day. It's all in God's plan and God literally through my gut
[02:57:10.760 --> 02:57:16.160]  My spirit has told me you don't back down. You don't give in ever you will beat these people
[02:57:16.160 --> 02:57:20.120]  We will beat them together, but you're gonna have to hold fast and never doubt me
[02:57:20.120 --> 02:57:26.200]  And then I just don't doubt and every time the doors close more doors open and we just get stronger together
[02:57:26.440 --> 02:57:28.880]  But it takes the commitment to spread the word
[02:57:28.880 --> 02:57:35.080]  It takes the commitment to get involved. It takes the commitment to get the products to find the operation and you're doing it
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:38.680]  Paul Joseph Watson coming up take a few calls before he comes on stay with us
[02:57:45.000 --> 02:57:50.040]  Frank in North Carolina, thanks for holding so long go ahead. Yeah, I just have to say something man

[02:58:24.560 --> 02:58:27.320]  We can barely pay the bills and grow in the face of this
[02:58:27.320 --> 02:58:32.400]  I'm not gonna just stop growth and let them start pushing us backwards. You understand. I need your help Frank

[03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:37.400]  Hillary and George Soros. Hope you don't spread the word about that
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:44.760]  Let's go ahead and take a call from Ray and Florida. You're on the air, right?
[03:00:46.520 --> 03:00:52.480]  Alex I just Alex I want to thank you for allowing us Americans to actually speak out and actually be heard on your airwaves
[03:00:52.480 --> 03:00:54.480]  What a blessing I appreciate you brother
[03:00:55.000 --> 03:00:55.800]  Very quickly
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:00.400]  I would like to urge all of my compatriots all of my patreots to call the White House
[03:01:01.520 --> 03:01:03.800]  202-456-1414 and demand
[03:01:03.800 --> 03:01:07.920]  Hillary's arrest start with her and then move on down the scale
[03:01:08.600 --> 03:01:13.520]  Seth rich and Sean Lucas deserves to be recognized for their sacrifices and what they did
[03:01:14.040 --> 03:01:21.000]  Also, I'd like to urge you to call Muller 202-663-6364. He's a traitor menace of this country
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:26.440]  And he belongs before a firing squad. He's a worthless sack of shit. Pardon. We can't do that
[03:01:26.440 --> 03:01:30.760]  I appreciate your call and like I'm not saying you're giving out fake numbers, but I haven't checked them
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:37.200]  Sometimes people call with people's fake phone numbers and becomes a big fiasco Muller is just a puppet. He's already moved on down the road
[03:01:38.440 --> 03:01:40.680]  But yeah, this country's in a crazy situation
[03:01:41.920 --> 03:01:45.240]  Let's go ahead and go to Jim and Georgia Jim. You're on the air. Go ahead
[03:01:45.880 --> 03:01:51.080]  In a while in a while, I love you and respect you I respect you
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:53.880]  the very symbol of
[03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:56.680]  injustice in America is
[03:01:56.680 --> 03:02:00.680]  Hillary Clinton she
[03:02:01.160 --> 03:02:03.800]  Must be at least in prison
[03:02:04.360 --> 03:02:11.760]  Must be or it will die and then we could move on to 9-11 and all that stuff
[03:02:12.920 --> 03:02:18.120]  She must be in prison. Have you heard anything on the inside?
[03:02:18.120 --> 03:02:27.840]  To lead you to believe that that's something is going on there. Well, yes
[03:02:28.120 --> 03:02:34.320]  Lindsey Graham and Trump came out today and said they are pushing for a reopening of the investigation on Hillary. Thanks for the call
[03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:36.320]  I hear your brother
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:40.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dennis in Virginia than Debbie in New Jersey. Go ahead Dennis
[03:02:40.760 --> 03:02:49.960]  Hey Alex welcome. Yeah, I enjoy your show very much. I think President Trump is getting ready to unleash the dogs of war
[03:02:50.360 --> 03:02:57.320]  He's been laying low for a while. I think he's watching these guys just tripping from wall in himself saying I think he's gonna really get down to business
[03:02:57.920 --> 03:03:03.240]  You know Trump could definitely do that if he had good people, but the average lawyers and average people in DC are literally
[03:03:03.960 --> 03:03:06.240]  mind-dumb mindless scumbags
[03:03:06.240 --> 03:03:11.880]  Yeah, but I'll tell you the way these tech giants and MSM monopolies have weaponized their platforms and outlets
[03:03:12.640 --> 03:03:16.440]  They need to be broken up and in some cases lose their license
[03:03:17.760 --> 03:03:21.560]  Well, we'll see what happens. I don't want to wish any harm against anybody, you know
[03:03:23.000 --> 03:03:27.840]  But I hear what you're saying that this is a serious situation Debbie in New Jersey. You're on the air. Go ahead
[03:03:29.120 --> 03:03:30.640]  Hey Alex
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:39.400]  The first thing I think is that Trump should oust these demonic clit-less walking black tampon frauds that have infiltrated our government
[03:03:39.640 --> 03:03:41.640]  That's the first thing
[03:03:41.640 --> 03:03:48.280]  Second, let's indict all these criminal Dems for RICO racketeering fraud extortion lean their oath and bond
[03:03:49.440 --> 03:03:53.760]  Bankrupt them sees all their assets put them out of business
[03:03:53.760 --> 03:03:59.400]  I hear you and I think that that is
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:05.840]  Something a lot of Americans are thinking and you know, they're really upset about
[03:04:06.560 --> 03:04:10.440]  Just the lawlessness we've seen not was just with a small case
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:17.760]  But with the Russia gate and with Hillary servers and the sellout to China just the lawlessness of the Democratic Party and the
[03:04:17.760 --> 03:04:21.200]  And the acquiescence of so many Democrats in this process
[03:04:21.200 --> 03:04:24.840]  We have the power to do it. Let's do it. Why do we keep playing games with them?
[03:04:24.840 --> 03:04:30.760]  This is what frustrates and angers me because I'm tired of hearing. Oh, we have to be nice. We have to do it this way
[03:04:30.760 --> 03:04:37.280]  We can't get angry. Well, we're angry. Oh, I hear you. God bless you, ma'am. I'm sorry. They're callers Luke and Harry and Dean
[03:04:37.280 --> 03:04:42.160]  But I'll be back tomorrow 11 central Paul Joseph Watson from her Britannic

[03:06:04.840 --> 03:06:07.840]  Now your host Paul Joseph Watson
[03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:18.840]  You're live in this fourth hour and we're continuing to look at the reaction to the absolutely unbelievable developing story that the charges against
[03:06:19.840 --> 03:06:21.840]  Empire actor Justy Smollett have been dropped
[03:06:22.840 --> 03:06:27.840]  Jack Pasobic just tweeted Justy Smollett should be charged under federal hate crime laws for the actual crime
[03:06:27.840 --> 03:06:31.840]  We know he committed against white Trump supporters
[03:06:31.840 --> 03:06:34.840]  Chicago Democrat Mayor Rahm Emanuel
[03:06:35.840 --> 03:06:42.840]  Even Rahm Emanuel said he was let off scot-free with no sense of accountability for the moral and ethical wrong of his actions
[03:06:43.840 --> 03:06:48.840]  Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson and I think we've got this clip we can roll it here in a second
[03:06:49.840 --> 03:06:54.840]  Said it's mr. Smollett who committed this hoax period. We've got that clip. Let's roll it
[03:06:54.840 --> 03:07:00.840]  So listen, I'm sure we all know what occurred this morning
[03:07:01.840 --> 03:07:05.840]  My personal opinion is that you all know where I stand
[03:07:06.840 --> 03:07:08.840]  Do I think justice will serve? No
[03:07:09.840 --> 03:07:11.840]  What do I think justice is?
[03:07:13.840 --> 03:07:15.840]  I think this city is still old and apology
[03:07:16.840 --> 03:07:18.840]  And let me digress one more
[03:07:18.840 --> 03:07:21.840]  When I came on this job I've been a cop now for about 31 years
[03:07:21.840 --> 03:07:25.840]  When I came on this job I came on with my honor, my integrity, my reputation
[03:07:26.840 --> 03:07:31.840]  If someone accused me of doing anything that would circumvent that
[03:07:31.840 --> 03:07:36.840]  Then I would want my day in court period to clear my name
[03:07:38.840 --> 03:07:44.840]  I've heard that they wanted their day in court with TV cameras so America could know the truth
[03:07:44.840 --> 03:07:48.840]  And though they chose to hide behind secrecy and broker a deal
[03:07:48.840 --> 03:07:50.840]  To circumvent the judicial system
[03:07:52.840 --> 03:07:56.840]  My job as a police officer is to investigate an incident
[03:07:56.840 --> 03:07:59.840]  Gather evidence, gather facts and present them to the state's attorney
[03:07:59.840 --> 03:08:00.840]  That's what we did
[03:08:00.840 --> 03:08:03.840]  I stand behind the detective's investigation
[03:08:06.840 --> 03:08:08.840]  I'll let Mary Maddox comment further
[03:08:09.840 --> 03:08:13.840]  That was Chicago police superintendent Eddie Johnson
[03:08:13.840 --> 03:08:18.840]  Reacting again to the charges against Justice Millette being dropped
[03:08:18.840 --> 03:08:22.840]  Former chief prosecutor Bob Bianchi on Justice Millette
[03:08:22.840 --> 03:08:28.840]  He said, I think prosecutors caved to the court of public opinion and gave the case away
[03:08:28.840 --> 03:08:32.840]  He called it a sickening abuse of prosecutorial discretion
[03:08:32.840 --> 03:08:36.840]  Charlie Kirk tweeted an image of Smollett alongside Hillary Clinton
[03:08:36.840 --> 03:08:39.840]  He said, on Twitter, believe you are above the law
[03:08:39.840 --> 03:08:43.840]  Commit idiotic crime in full public view
[03:08:43.840 --> 03:08:45.840]  Deny that you ever committed that crime
[03:08:45.840 --> 03:08:48.840]  Media runs cover, overwhelming evidence proves that you are guilty
[03:08:48.840 --> 03:08:53.840]  Demand special treatment, receive special treatment from liberal prosecutors
[03:08:53.840 --> 03:08:56.840]  And then walk free
[03:08:56.840 --> 03:08:58.840]  And is this anything to do with it?
[03:08:58.840 --> 03:09:01.840]  GI wonder, headline, out of Breitbart.com
[03:09:01.840 --> 03:09:08.840]  George Soros donated $408,000 to Kim Fox, prosecutor who let
[03:09:08.840 --> 03:09:14.840]  Justice Millette walk, who of course was in cahoots with the Obamas
[03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:19.840]  Left wing billionaire Megadona George Soros donated $408,000 to a super PAC
[03:09:19.840 --> 03:09:22.840]  That supported Cook County State's attorney Kim Fox
[03:09:22.840 --> 03:09:27.840]  The prosecutor in the Justice Millette case in her election campaign in 2016
[03:09:27.840 --> 03:09:31.840]  And again, whenever you talk about George, it's like, oh my God
[03:09:31.840 --> 03:09:35.840]  You're talking about George Soros giving money to a group or an individual
[03:09:35.840 --> 03:09:40.840]  The entire purpose of his life, which he's been doing for decades and decades
[03:09:40.840 --> 03:09:44.840]  Oh, that's anti-Semitic, you can't say the words George Soros
[03:09:44.840 --> 03:09:50.840]  In a shock announcement Tuesday, Fox dropped all 16 felon charges against Smollett
[03:09:50.840 --> 03:09:54.840]  Again, Soros has spent heavily on backing progressive candidates for local
[03:09:54.840 --> 03:09:57.840]  Local prosecutorial offices across the nation
[03:09:57.840 --> 03:10:00.840]  Following the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014
[03:10:00.840 --> 03:10:07.840]  So that's from where this donation arose, he gave $408,000 to the prosecutor
[03:10:07.840 --> 03:10:13.840]  Who got Smollett off the hook in this shady back room deal, which I'm sure is completely above board
[03:10:13.840 --> 03:10:18.840]  Report, Chicago Police Superintendent Furious Smollett charges dropped
[03:10:18.840 --> 03:10:21.840]  We just played that clip from Eddie Johnson
[03:10:21.840 --> 03:10:28.840]  Former prosecutor says states' explanation for Justice Millette case dismissal makes no sense
[03:10:28.840 --> 03:10:34.840]  This was law and crime network host Bob Bianchi who was once the chief prosecutor in Morris County, New Jersey
[03:10:34.840 --> 03:10:37.840]  He questioned the decision making of the local prosecutors
[03:10:37.840 --> 03:10:41.840]  And again, as I just said, he called it sickening abuse
[03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:45.840]  He said that remarks by the prosecutors make no sense
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:10:49.840]  And the idea that Smollett would do service goes against how criminal cases normally work
[03:10:49.840 --> 03:10:52.840]  So he already did the community service
[03:10:52.840 --> 03:10:56.840]  How is that related in any way to the current situation?
[03:10:56.840 --> 03:11:06.840]  And in what upside-down backwards world can you get charges dropped because of a community service issue?
[03:11:06.840 --> 03:11:10.840]  I mean, it just absolutely makes no sense whatsoever
[03:11:10.840 --> 03:11:15.840]  They're admitting that he's guilty of something but then saying he's not guilty of anything
[03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:21.840]  Just absolutely la-la-land behavior and Twitter is absolutely ablaze
[03:11:21.840 --> 03:11:30.840]  Stefan Molyneux tweets, American justice, no collusion is investigated for years destroying families' careers and lives
[03:11:30.840 --> 03:11:33.840]  Real collusion walks
[03:11:33.840 --> 03:11:42.840]  And again, the prosecutor involved funded to the tune of $408,000 by George Soros
[03:11:42.840 --> 03:11:46.840]  Absolutely incredible, we'll continue to cover that as news comes in
[03:11:46.840 --> 03:11:55.840]  But on a related subject, CNN is now claiming that it's literally not the job of journalists to investigate things
[03:11:55.840 --> 03:12:00.840]  They literally came out and made that claim, headline on infowars.com
[03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:04.840]  Brian Stelter gets roasted for saying it's not CNN's job to investigate
[03:12:04.840 --> 03:12:14.840]  He was tweeting the CNN president, Jeff Zucker, who said yesterday, quote, we are not investigators, we are journalists
[03:12:14.840 --> 03:12:18.840]  Yes, that's your entire job as journalists
[03:12:18.840 --> 03:12:28.840]  In fact, someone pointed to the fact that CNN hired BuzzFeed's K-File investigative team to investigate news stories
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:36.840]  So they hired an investigative team, now they're claiming they're not investigators simply to absolve themselves of blame
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:49.840]  For pushing for two years plus solid the hysterical, maniacal, fake news hoax of Russian collusion while pointing their fingers at infowars and similar outlets
[03:12:49.840 --> 03:13:01.840]  Saying that we were peddling fake news, calling for lobbying for us to be de-platformed for fake news while they were pushing it to great harm, a great harm to the nation
[03:13:01.840 --> 03:13:04.840]  Risking potential war
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:09.840]  Undermining democracy, they were pushing that fake news for two years plus
[03:13:09.840 --> 03:13:15.840]  Is anyone going to come out and apologize? Is anyone going to get disciplined? Is anyone going to get fired?
[03:13:15.840 --> 03:13:24.840]  Is anyone going to have a single moment of self-reflection and realize that you're not supposed to be activists, you're supposed to be journalists
[03:13:24.840 --> 03:13:29.840]  who remain impartial, neutral, and yes, investigate things
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:41.840]  And Stelter tweeted this out, he got completely ratioed, 15,000 responses compared to just 1,100 retweets, that's when you know you get ratioed
[03:13:41.840 --> 03:13:47.840]  Mike Cernovich responded, he said, for real Brian, in what world does this help you or CNN?
[03:13:47.840 --> 03:13:59.840]  CNN press Jeff Zucker, we honor investigators, I'm trying bro, help us understand, we honor investigators, how doesn't this expose everyone at CNN as scribes for people in government
[03:13:59.840 --> 03:14:07.840]  And in claiming they're not investigators, that's exactly what they're admitting, that they're basically stenographers for what the authorities tell them
[03:14:07.840 --> 03:14:13.840]  In this case, the authorities being the deep state for the past two years plus
[03:14:13.840 --> 03:14:22.840]  Jack Pasobic tweeted at him, as a joke, we don't check it into anything the government tells us, it's a great line for a news organization to take
[03:14:22.840 --> 03:14:27.840]  Not that any of us are surprised, but the sheer audacity of admitting it
[03:14:27.840 --> 03:14:36.840]  And within a couple of hours, Brian Stelter of CNN blocked Jack Pasobic on Twitter because he had no counter argument
[03:14:36.840 --> 03:14:43.840]  David Wall said, we're not investigators, we're not journalists, we're worker bees for the primary media propaganda wing of the DNC
[03:14:43.840 --> 03:14:47.840]  That at least would have been an honest assessment of fake news central
[03:14:47.840 --> 03:15:02.840]  And again, not a single member of the mainstream media has come out and apologized, all being disciplined, all being fired for pushing the biggest fake news hoax in a generation since Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction
[03:15:02.840 --> 03:15:14.840]  Now, when we come back in the next segment, I'm going to get into Stephen Colbert, who pushed the fake news Russian collusion scam for two plus years on his show almost every single night
[03:15:14.840 --> 03:15:23.840]  But now guess who he's blaming? Oh, yes, it's Trump's fault. Why is it Trump's fault? Well, because Orange Man bad, that's literally his reason
[03:15:23.840 --> 03:15:32.840]  So we're going to get into that. We're going to get into the EU breaking the internet to censor memes with article 13, which just passed today
[03:15:32.840 --> 03:15:44.840]  And the real reason behind that, we're going to get into a activist in Australia being de-platformed by Facebook because he defended himself against a mainstream media smear campaign
[03:15:44.840 --> 03:15:50.840]  So we'll get into that and a lot more in the next segment. This is the Alex Jones show live breaking news info wars dot com. We'll be back
[03:15:50.840 --> 03:15:57.840]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house

[03:16:22.840 --> 03:16:28.840]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world
[03:16:28.840 --> 03:16:37.840]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars. The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken
[03:16:37.840 --> 03:16:46.840]  Its former colony the U.S. had to save the empire. Was there ever a vote? Who do we fight for? The deep state began with World War I
[03:16:46.840 --> 03:16:52.840]  The United States of Empire by James Dunn available at Amazon Books

[03:20:14.840 --> 03:20:25.840]  You're back on the Alex Jones show live before I get into some more news
[03:20:25.840 --> 03:20:33.840]  I really need to tell you about the Save the First Amendment Stop Big Tech Censorship special which is still running at InfoWareStore.com
[03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:40.840]  50% off all InfoWare's life products with double-patriot points and free shipping site-wide
[03:20:40.840 --> 03:20:48.840]  One of those discounts is a whopping 50% discount on the energy drink turbo force
[03:20:48.840 --> 03:20:53.840]  And I've just got to say this is just off the charts
[03:20:53.840 --> 03:20:56.840]  This is like some kind of legal high without the come down
[03:20:56.840 --> 03:21:03.840]  I mean when Alex says don't take the full sachet on the first few times you take it
[03:21:03.840 --> 03:21:05.840]  People should take that advice
[03:21:05.840 --> 03:21:12.840]  Perhaps kids shouldn't have this either because this gives you an absolute turbo injection of energy
[03:21:12.840 --> 03:21:19.840]  I got about five hours sleep last night just had one sachet of turbo force and I'm literally bouncing off the walls
[03:21:19.840 --> 03:21:21.840]  That's how good this is
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:25.840]  And what's even better about it is that you don't get the come down
[03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:31.840]  You don't get that junk come down from what you would normally get from other energy drinks
[03:21:31.840 --> 03:21:36.840]  It just wears off so then you can have another one or maybe that's not a great idea
[03:21:36.840 --> 03:21:41.840]  Maybe you want to spread them out because this is really really powerful
[03:21:41.840 --> 03:21:45.840]  It's turbo force, it's available right now at InfoWareStore.com

[03:22:20.840 --> 03:22:25.840]  Now of course the fallout from the Russian collusion hoax continues
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:30.840]  Instead of having a moment of reflection which was long overdue for the mainstream media
[03:22:30.840 --> 03:22:36.840]  They've simply turned around and pointed the finger back at President Trump
[03:22:36.840 --> 03:22:43.840]  Daily Caller reports Colbert says Trump only has himself to blame for Russian collusion conspiracy theory
[03:22:43.840 --> 03:22:50.840]  Now this is a guy who almost every night on his unfunny late night comedy show
[03:22:50.840 --> 03:22:55.840]  Talked about Donald Trump colluding with Russians to steal the election
[03:22:55.840 --> 03:22:59.840]  You've seen the clips over and over and over again
[03:22:59.840 --> 03:23:05.840]  He also obviously got in trouble for the PP holster comment he made about Putin and Trump
[03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:09.840]  Had to apologize for that, another hilarious example of the left eating their own
[03:23:09.840 --> 03:23:13.840]  But every single night he was on it, night after night after night
[03:23:13.840 --> 03:23:16.840]  And what's his reaction now it's all collapsed
[03:23:16.840 --> 03:23:20.840]  The late night show host Stephen Colbert said Monday night that President Donald Trump
[03:23:20.840 --> 03:23:25.840]  Only has himself to blame for being subjected to a two year investigation with a false premise
[03:23:25.840 --> 03:23:32.840]  So he basically got up this whiteboard of everything bad that Donald Trump's ever said or done in his eyes
[03:23:32.840 --> 03:23:37.840]  Most of it's completely made up or grossly exaggerated of course
[03:23:37.840 --> 03:23:43.840]  His basic argument, given that he's pushed this fake news conspiracy theory for two years plus
[03:23:43.840 --> 03:23:48.840]  Is that oh no it's not my fault it's Donald Trump's fault because orange man bad
[03:23:48.840 --> 03:23:55.840]  He literally defaulted back to that classic NPC orange man bad approach
[03:23:55.840 --> 03:24:00.840]  Again scribbled down a bunch of things on a whiteboard and said oh it's Donald Trump's fault
[03:24:00.840 --> 03:24:06.840]  That I continually lied to the American people and let's not give him the cover of being a comedian
[03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:12.840]  These people aren't comedians, they're political operatives, they're activists
[03:24:12.840 --> 03:24:17.840]  That's why they hate people like Jay Leno because back in the day he wasn't an activist
[03:24:17.840 --> 03:24:21.840]  He was an actual comedian, he would hit both sides of the political spectrum
[03:24:21.840 --> 03:24:24.840]  And he was funny, funnier than Colbert at least now
[03:24:24.840 --> 03:24:29.840]  Colbert back in the day of course cut his teeth going after George W. Bush
[03:24:29.840 --> 03:24:33.840]  And his militarism, his foreign intervention, his neocon wars
[03:24:33.840 --> 03:24:39.840]  Then what does he do to Tulsi Gabbard, one of the few Democratic candidates who speaks any kind of sense
[03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:47.840]  Gets her on his show and completely rinses her about her option, her opinion, her opposition to the war in Syria
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:51.840]  To trying to topple Assad by arming literal jihadists
[03:24:51.840 --> 03:24:55.840]  Which is the foreign policy that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton followed
[03:24:55.840 --> 03:25:00.840]  And it would have been the foreign policy that Hillary Clinton followed if she'd become president
[03:25:00.840 --> 03:25:02.840]  Is the one she followed as Secretary of State
[03:25:02.840 --> 03:25:10.840]  So you have Colbert, a man who cut his teeth rightly going after George W. Bush's militarism and his neocon adventures
[03:25:10.840 --> 03:25:17.840]  Now serving that very same deep state that wants to topple secular leaders in the Middle East
[03:25:17.840 --> 03:25:21.840]  Leading to absolute carnage, leading to the rise of ISIS, leading to the migrant crisis
[03:25:21.840 --> 03:25:26.840]  Tulsi Gabbard goes on a sane voice against that and he rips her to shreds
[03:25:26.840 --> 03:25:29.840]  Because again, not the man that he used to be, he's sold out
[03:25:29.840 --> 03:25:36.840]  Now he's blaming Trump for his lies that he said on his show repeatedly for two years solid
[03:25:36.840 --> 03:25:38.840]  As is the New York Times
[03:25:38.840 --> 03:25:44.840]  Headline New York Times tries to shift blame onto all of us for Russiagate hoax
[03:25:44.840 --> 03:25:48.840]  This is out of information liberation and it's up on infowars.com
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:54.840]  Rather than take personal responsibility for pushing the Russiagate hoax for over two years straight without any evidence
[03:25:54.840 --> 03:25:59.840]  The New York Times ran a column on Monday trying to shift the blame onto all of us
[03:25:59.840 --> 03:26:02.840]  That's right, it's your fault too
[03:26:02.840 --> 03:26:07.840]  And it's Sean Hannity's fault, even though he literally argued the opposite for two plus years
[03:26:07.840 --> 03:26:09.840]  It's Sean Hannity's fault as well
[03:26:09.840 --> 03:26:18.840]  It said Sean Hannity-style Trumpians should apologize for peddling the sort of deep cynicism that undermines our country's institutions
[03:26:18.840 --> 03:26:28.840]  So Sean Hannity and others like him were proven right in triplicate saying that this was a contrived moral panic, a contrived hoax
[03:26:28.840 --> 03:26:31.840]  But they should apologize for being right
[03:26:31.840 --> 03:26:39.840]  The only people who undermined the country for two plus years were the people pushing this fake news delusion that caused division
[03:26:39.840 --> 03:26:47.840]  That caused Russia and America to be at the brink of some kind of military exchange in some cases
[03:26:47.840 --> 03:26:50.840]  Given the sanctions and what that could have led to
[03:26:50.840 --> 03:26:52.840]  But no, it's Sean Hannity's fault
[03:26:52.840 --> 03:26:56.840]  From the New York Times David Brooks, we've all just been made fools of ourselves again
[03:26:56.840 --> 03:27:03.840]  Maybe it's time to declare a national Sabbath, maybe it's time to step back from scandal-mongering and assess who we are right now
[03:27:03.840 --> 03:27:06.840]  Now that should be applauded at a moment of self-reflection
[03:27:06.840 --> 03:27:14.840]  But then he goes on to say Republicans and the Sean Hannity-style Trumpians might also approach this moment with an attitude of humility
[03:27:14.840 --> 03:27:20.840]  And honest self-examination even though they were proven right and have literally nothing to apologize for
[03:27:20.840 --> 03:27:25.840]  For two years they've been calling the Mueller investigation a witch hunt, which is exactly what it was
[03:27:25.840 --> 03:27:29.840]  For two years they've been spreading the libel that there are no honest brokers in Washington
[03:27:29.840 --> 03:27:32.840]  It's all a deep-state conspiracy, a swamp
[03:27:32.840 --> 03:27:35.840]  Yeah, I'm sure everybody's honest in Washington DC
[03:27:35.840 --> 03:27:39.840]  It's renowned for its honesty, isn't it, that city?
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:42.840]  Just as Chicago is in the case of Smollett
[03:27:42.840 --> 03:27:47.840]  They should apologize for peddling the sort of deep cynicism that undermines our country's institutions
[03:27:47.840 --> 03:27:52.840]  Even though that's literally what the mainstream media did
[03:27:52.840 --> 03:27:58.840]  It was them that undermined democracy, it was them that tried to sabotage a legitimately elected president
[03:27:58.840 --> 03:28:00.840]  Another headline here
[03:28:00.840 --> 03:28:04.840]  Nets gave 2,284 minutes to Trump-Russia conspiracy theory
[03:28:04.840 --> 03:28:10.840]  Media wrote 533,000 articles
[03:28:10.840 --> 03:28:16.840]  They actually tottered up the amount that they paid attention to this story every night on news media
[03:28:16.840 --> 03:28:21.840]  And it was more than if there'd been a major war taking place
[03:28:21.840 --> 03:28:27.840]  That's literally the sustained level to which the mainstream media pushed this hoax for two plus years
[03:28:27.840 --> 03:28:33.840]  They afforded more time to it than they would have done if America had literally been at war
[03:28:33.840 --> 03:28:40.840]  That's how deeply ingrained and embedded and responsible the mainstream media was for pushing this hoax
[03:28:40.840 --> 03:28:46.840]  So how dare they try and point the finger at Trump or Hannity or info wars and say that we're responsible
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:29:15.840]  The absolute height of delusion will be back
[03:29:15.840 --> 03:29:20.840]  My blood pressure has normalized, my diabetes has totally improved

[03:29:26.840 --> 03:29:34.840]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy

[03:32:10.840 --> 03:32:17.840]  I thought X3 is great, we still got another deep breath crystal source, but I thought at the other two types of iodine scientists that do that
[03:32:17.840 --> 03:32:24.840]  It sold a lot that people want original X2, I was resigned the fact we didn't have X2, but it came through about a month ago
[03:32:24.840 --> 03:32:28.840]  We now have X2 again at InfoWarsTour.com, so hallelujah
[03:32:28.840 --> 03:32:35.840]  It's been sold out for about almost three months, but we have now had the same company, the original X2
[03:32:35.840 --> 03:32:40.840]  We developed it again and we were able to do the exact same formula
[03:32:40.840 --> 03:32:47.840]  We want to pre-order X2, the ultimate iodine out there, learn about the iodine conspiracy, learn about IQs dropping when you don't have it
[03:32:47.840 --> 03:33:13.840]  Learn about how the other iodines are bound, get yours today at InfoWarsTour.com or InfoWarsLife.com
[03:33:13.840 --> 03:33:20.840]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[03:33:20.840 --> 03:33:25.840]  And now your host, Paul Joseph Watson
[03:33:25.840 --> 03:33:30.840]  And we are live on the Alex Jones show 4th hour
[03:33:30.840 --> 03:33:36.840]  Now I want to get into article 13 because it passed today, it's absolutely horrific, the consequences are not going to be known
[03:33:36.840 --> 03:33:44.840]  The UK where I live obviously would be free from the consequences if we actually left the EU as we voted to nearly three years ago
[03:33:44.840 --> 03:33:50.840]  And it hasn't happened yet because we don't live in a democracy anymore, so we probably will be affected by this
[03:33:50.840 --> 03:33:58.840]  This is article 13 and the best way to explain why it's so bad is with this video I made about the subject about nine months ago
[03:33:58.840 --> 03:34:05.840]  When it was first introduced and then I'll come back and read the latest news on article 13, but here is that video
[03:34:05.840 --> 03:34:07.840]  They're really doing it
[03:34:07.840 --> 03:34:11.840]  They're coming for the one thing that we thought was sacred
[03:34:11.840 --> 03:34:16.840]  They're coming to ban the memes
[03:34:16.840 --> 03:34:25.840]  Researchers at University College London have developed an algorithm that can automatically detect and censor hateful content before it's uploaded
[03:34:25.840 --> 03:34:27.840]  What could possibly go wrong?
[03:34:27.840 --> 03:34:36.840]  Why could this algorithm be abused by parties and social media giants to prevent the viral spread of memes that benefit right of centre political movements and candidates?
[03:34:36.840 --> 03:34:40.840]  They'd never do such a thing, would they?
[03:34:40.840 --> 03:34:44.840]  But why does this matter? Because memes can change history
[03:34:44.840 --> 03:34:54.840]  As Richard Dawkins first explained, memes are like genes for information and human evolution has been guided as much by memes as genes
[03:34:54.840 --> 03:35:02.840]  Memes compete with each other for survival, control the meme, control future, human thought and behaviour
[03:35:02.840 --> 03:35:04.840]  This is about influence
[03:35:04.840 --> 03:35:14.840]  Leftist websites like Salon the New Yorker and The Guardian have been bitterly complaining for years about the undue influence of meme warfare on contemporary politics
[03:35:14.840 --> 03:35:24.840]  They warn that the political meme has become the centrepiece of disinformation campaigns and the ability of memes to communicate ideology is boundless
[03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:28.840]  The power of the political meme has never been greater
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:33.840]  Now what possible motive do you think the left could have for wanting to ban memes?
[03:35:33.840 --> 03:35:37.840]  Could it really be? Because the left can't meme
[03:35:37.840 --> 03:35:38.840]  Surely not
[03:35:38.840 --> 03:35:40.840]  I mean surely they wouldn't, yep it's that
[03:35:40.840 --> 03:35:48.840]  The University College London study found that the most effective and widely spread memes largely originated in two places
[03:35:48.840 --> 03:35:53.840]  The Donald and Paul, both of which aren't really known for their left wing sympathies
[03:35:53.840 --> 03:36:02.840]  So now we finally have solid proof backed up by the kind of facts and logic that would even put Ben Shapiro to shame that the left can't meme
[03:36:02.840 --> 03:36:08.840]  As we all know if something doesn't benefit the left the only reasonable thing to do is ban it
[03:36:08.840 --> 03:36:15.840]  So you remember I mentioned that algorithm which is able to identify harmful content and prevent it from being uploaded
[03:36:15.840 --> 03:36:18.840]  Guess what the EU wants to make social media companies do?
[03:36:18.840 --> 03:36:23.840]  Develop an algorithm that can identify harmful content and prevent it from being uploaded
[03:36:23.840 --> 03:36:24.840]  Well imagine my shock
[03:36:24.840 --> 03:36:37.840]  The EU's new article 13 copyright proposal which will be voted on this week would force websites to install upload filters that would automatically censor any content deemed to be a copyright violation
[03:36:37.840 --> 03:36:42.840]  This is a complete misunderstanding of both fair use and transformative content
[03:36:42.840 --> 03:36:49.840]  But this is the EU we're talking about and they're not known for having a firm grasp of the sovereign interests of the individual
[03:36:49.840 --> 03:36:55.840]  Google-owned YouTube and Facebook already have filters that block porn and copyrighted content before it's posted
[03:36:55.840 --> 03:37:03.840]  So in effect all this will achieve is a de facto ban on memes and a draconian crackdown on the sharing of information
[03:37:03.840 --> 03:37:08.840]  You know the entire foundation of how the internet is structured and what makes it work
[03:37:08.840 --> 03:37:18.840]  The proposal would also institute a link tax which would require users to get a license from the publisher just to include snippets from a news article like this
[03:37:18.840 --> 03:37:26.840]  I literally wouldn't be allowed to display a screenshot from a news article like this without getting sued for copyright violation
[03:37:26.840 --> 03:37:33.840]  Click the link in the description below to contact your MEP and tell them to vote against this absurd proposal
[03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:41.840]  Because if it's implemented and used as a template for other countries outside of the EU, the internet as we know and love it is finished
[03:37:41.840 --> 03:37:51.840]  In short, article 13 will impose widespread censorship of all the content you share online be it a parody video, a remix, a meme, a blog post
[03:37:51.840 --> 03:37:59.840]  Comments on Reddit, a piece of code, live streaming your gaming experience, or even a link in a tweet
[03:37:59.840 --> 03:38:03.840]  Spain also wants to ban memes that are insulting to politicians
[03:38:03.840 --> 03:38:07.840]  CNN docks us and harasses people for posting memes
[03:38:07.840 --> 03:38:08.840]  So it's a pincer movement
[03:38:08.840 --> 03:38:16.840]  On the one hand you've got the establishment in general that doesn't understand the language of memes and is therefore frustrated that it can't control them
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:23.840]  Then on the other hand you've got the political left which no longer understands humour and therefore is completely useless at creating them
[03:38:23.840 --> 03:38:28.840]  At the legislative level they're going to use copyright laws to censor memes
[03:38:28.840 --> 03:38:37.840]  And at the cultural level they're going to continue to hype the contrived moral panic of spicy memes being a new form of virulent online hate speech
[03:38:37.840 --> 03:38:45.840]  Just as many left-wing websites have removed comment sections because studies prove they influence the reader more than the article itself
[03:38:45.840 --> 03:38:50.840]  This is yet another attempt to rig the game and monopolise the narrative
[03:38:50.840 --> 03:38:55.840]  It doesn't matter what your politics are, censorship can never be justified
[03:38:55.840 --> 03:39:03.840]  And all this serves as yet another reminder that the future political battlefield of ideas won't be decided on who has the best ideas
[03:39:03.840 --> 03:39:10.840]  It won't be decided on who is most skilled at communicating a message to others on a level playing field
[03:39:10.840 --> 03:39:14.840]  It will be decided on who controls the algorithm
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:20.840]  Studies have proven that algorithms can potentially shift millions of votes in national elections
[03:39:20.840 --> 03:39:28.840]  So until we stem the relentless tide of social media censorship that is undermining the democratisation of information
[03:39:28.840 --> 03:39:32.840]  We're all slaves to the algorithm
[03:39:32.840 --> 03:39:35.840]  There you have it
[03:39:35.840 --> 03:39:45.840]  I encourage people to contact their MEPs to vote down this law, obviously not enough people did that because it was voted through today
[03:39:45.840 --> 03:39:51.840]  Edward Snowden has responded to this on Twitter and again this is going to be phased in over the next two years
[03:39:51.840 --> 03:39:53.840]  It could literally break the internet
[03:39:53.840 --> 03:39:56.840]  Who knows what chaos is going to ensue after this
[03:39:56.840 --> 03:40:04.840]  Who knows if the UK is actually going to leave the EU within the next two years, given the situation with Brexit right now
[03:40:04.840 --> 03:40:10.840]  RT headline, never forget what they did here, Snowden vents dismay at EU copyright reform
[03:40:10.840 --> 03:40:16.840]  NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden has decried the EU's decision to pass highly controversial copyright reform
[03:40:16.840 --> 03:40:20.840]  In a move that critics argue clamps down on free speech
[03:40:20.840 --> 03:40:24.840]  He tweeted in German, never forget what they did here
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:35.840]  Since CDU CSU that is the coalition government in Germany voted for, never voted for more internet freedom, the internet must never vote once more for the CDU
[03:40:35.840 --> 03:40:40.840]  So he's calling on people to vote out the German government which basically rubber stamped this
[03:40:40.840 --> 03:40:43.840]  Of course we had the story earlier today
[03:40:43.840 --> 03:40:54.840]  Of media matters, literally deplatforming an entire channel because it had a Joe Rogan podcast on it which was going to go viral
[03:40:54.840 --> 03:40:59.840]  They did a hit piece about it, within three hours the entire channel was gone
[03:40:59.840 --> 03:41:05.840]  And that's the point, memes can win elections, why do you think they banned, why do you think they deplatformed Alex Jones
[03:41:05.840 --> 03:41:10.840]  They weren't just deplatforming a person, they were deplatforming a meme
[03:41:10.840 --> 03:41:17.840]  The point I made in that video, studies have shown scientifically that the left cannot meme
[03:41:17.840 --> 03:41:26.840]  All the most effective widespread memes during the 2016 presidential election came from 4chan, came from the Donald subreddit
[03:41:26.840 --> 03:41:37.840]  The left cannot meme and as memes become increasingly important in political campaigns as the online world becomes even more important than it was in 2016
[03:41:37.840 --> 03:41:45.840]  What is the left going to do, they can't meme so they're just going to silence once again their opposition, it's their go to tactic every single time
[03:41:45.840 --> 03:41:58.840]  And again within three hours this YouTube channel was completely deleted because it had previously been used to host info wars videos literally over six months ago
[03:41:58.840 --> 03:42:06.840]  Again they're in contact with YouTube, YouTube's a giant corporation, media matters is supposedly a charity
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:15.840]  That's dubious in and of itself, they're in direct contact with each other, working together, this is cronyism writ large
[03:42:15.840 --> 03:42:22.840]  And now with this article 13, they're literally going to have to install filters on YouTube, on Twitter, on Facebook
[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:32.840]  Which ban images that it says are copyright protected even though that completely precludes the fact that all memes are transformative
[03:42:32.840 --> 03:42:41.840]  There's no understanding of that in the language of this EU bill, this is going to break the internet, it's going to get very messy indeed
[03:42:41.840 --> 03:43:03.840]  We'll be back in the next segment of the Alex Jones show with more news, breaking news at infowars.com. Go away

[03:49:07.840 --> 03:49:15.840]  Why about you then they do platform you so you can't defend yourself that's the whole point. So this activist out of Australia.
[03:49:15.840 --> 03:49:32.840]  Appeared or gave an interview with Jim Jeffries for a hit piece. The interview was conducted two months ago. They have him on after the New Zealand terror attack basically to lump him in with right wing extremist because he's a critic of Islam basically to blame the attack on him.
[03:49:32.840 --> 03:49:46.840]  So they have him on this show with Jim Jeffries a foul mouth leftist in public at least and they cut up his answers. So it looks like he's answering a question when he's not that he gave an answer to a different question.
[03:49:46.840 --> 03:49:59.840]  They cut it up and put it after the wrong question. Then there's other footage which shows Jim Jeffries making what he would call or he would blame someone else for Islamophobic jokes.
[03:49:59.840 --> 03:50:12.840]  He's drawing the Prophet Mohammed. He's making fun of Mohammed. Now this article says Aussie activist aviamini found his Facebook page permanently banned by Facebook for allegedly using hate speech.
[03:50:12.840 --> 03:50:22.840]  Again the exact same reason they used to ban Alex Jones completely vague. No specific example. Boom. Your Facebook page is gone. 300,000 followers gone.
[03:50:22.840 --> 03:50:32.840]  Again right after he exposed Jim Jeffries with this viral video they deplatform you so you don't have the ability to defend yourself.
[03:50:32.840 --> 03:50:46.840]  It's sinister to the core. It's absolutely disturbing. Facebook unpublished his page Tuesday and sent the activist a message that said your page has been unpublished for using hate speech which goes against the Facebook community standards.
[03:50:46.840 --> 03:50:56.840]  Again no specific example. Avi who had recently gained huge traction after exposing an attempt by Comedy Central's Jim Jeffries to link him to the New Zealand mosque attack.
[03:50:56.840 --> 03:51:05.840]  He gained over 1.5 million views on YouTube before his page was banned. Remains to be seen if his YouTube page is going to be pulled down as well.
[03:51:05.840 --> 03:51:16.840]  He told Politico I hardly used it but I've lost over 300,000 followers as this is the third page they have banned. Facebook is done. Their ongoing attack on free speech is ultimately going to cost them their business.
[03:51:16.840 --> 03:51:25.840]  Well depends doesn't it if Trump puts through the executive order like you promised to do months ago but it doesn't look like it's really going to happen.
[03:51:25.840 --> 03:51:31.840]  This just demonstrated even more clearly why sites like TR.News is so important. That's Tommy Robinson's website.
[03:51:31.840 --> 03:51:43.840]  So again they ban him immediately as he's in the public eye as he needs that platform to defend himself. Absolutely sinister and a tactic we see time and time again.
[03:51:43.840 --> 03:51:51.840]  Meanwhile, far right Austrian activist and leader of white nationalist group. That's the Daily Mail headline.
[03:51:51.840 --> 03:52:04.840]  Has his home raidered as police probes connection to the Christchurch mosque gunman. This is Martin Selma Selma head of the Identitarian movement of Austria generation identity.
[03:52:04.840 --> 03:52:17.840]  Basically received a large donation four figure donation from somebody with the surname Tarrant, which of course is the same surname as the New Zealand mosque shooter.
[03:52:17.840 --> 03:52:26.840]  He claims it could be a set up. Obviously that donation would have had to be sent before last Friday when the horrific attack happened.
[03:52:26.840 --> 03:52:35.840]  The article quotes Selma as saying I had nothing to do with the attack. He said they would donate the money to a charitable organization.
[03:52:35.840 --> 03:52:41.840]  He suggested the reason for the donation might have been to provoke repressive measures against patriots.
[03:52:41.840 --> 03:52:58.840]  So now the Austrian police have raided his apartment have confiscated his laptop confiscated his other devices his cell phone because he received this suspicious donation from somebody called Tarrant before the New Zealand mosque massacre.
[03:52:58.840 --> 03:53:11.840]  Now isn't it funny or in fact it's sinister that this mosque attacker seems to have tried to smear and set up a bunch of people on the right.
[03:53:11.840 --> 03:53:25.840]  If this is true that he sent this donation by sending this donation for one and of course by including people like Candice Owens in his manifesto with that sardonic remark that Candice Owens was too extreme even for him.
[03:53:25.840 --> 03:53:35.840]  Clearly designed to smear Candice Owens because she's basically a centrist conservative in comparison to him at least a far right fringe nutcase.
[03:53:35.840 --> 03:53:43.840]  Again that's the point the far right fringe racist nutcases do not like the center right because they're not racist.
[03:53:43.840 --> 03:53:46.840]  They think they're not extreme enough. That's why they don't like them.
[03:53:46.840 --> 03:53:56.840]  That's why I included Candice Owens in that manifesto to smear her as being complicit in the attack because he hates Candice Owens.
[03:53:56.840 --> 03:54:08.840]  But again the media is never going to tell you that nuance they're just going to use it to do exactly what the gunman wanted to smear Candice Owens and to cause more division politically in society.
[03:54:08.840 --> 03:54:24.840]  They've got reports Wikipedia editors paid to protect political tech and media figures reporting how things in post recently revealed the case of Wikipedia editor Ed Sussman who was paid by media clients such as NBC and Axios to help diminish critical material.
[03:54:24.840 --> 03:54:43.840]  Again these pay these editors are being paid to massage information about people in media. Meanwhile if you or I tries to change our Wikipedia page if Alex Jones tried to change him his page to be more neutral to be more realistic those changes would be nixed within minutes.
[03:54:43.840 --> 03:54:57.840]  So it's all lies all the time just as it is with YouTube as Alex is exposed in searching his own name on YouTube. They literally broke their own search engine to make it impossible to find any Alex Jones videos on YouTube.
[03:54:57.840 --> 03:55:16.840]  The on mainstream media hit pieces absolutely absurd sensorious behavior. And now the report by Ashley Feinberg detailed how the former journalist Ed Sussman's work as a paid Wikipedia fixer for clients such as Axios NBC and Facebook.
[03:55:16.840 --> 03:55:29.840]  Feinberg's article noted several of Sussman's requests involve removing or watering down potentially damaging material about clients even when citing sources considered reliable on the site. So they give an example.
[03:55:29.840 --> 03:55:48.840]  Sussman requested changes to the page of Axios journalist Jonathan Swan regarding a false report he made last September claiming deputy attorney general Rob Rosenstein was resigning a line noting the incident in Swan's article was replaced with a paragraph hyping that Swan was the first to report Rosenstein's
[03:55:48.840 --> 03:56:01.840]  offer to resign. So basically he got that story entirely wrong got egg on his face. Then they paid someone to go into his Wikipedia page and edit it to hide the scandal.
[03:56:01.840 --> 03:56:17.840]  So Wikipedia is now completely controlled by these paid editors is completely controlled by left wing activists again. This is about them controlling the very nature of reality. Absolutely chilling stuff.
[03:56:17.840 --> 03:56:32.840]  Meanwhile Catholic churches are being desecrated throughout France. Of course we had the Palestinian cleric yesterday in an info wars dot com story basically saying that France will become the first Islamic State in Europe because Muslims are having children
[03:56:32.840 --> 03:56:47.840]  and Western Europeans are not. Now since the beginning of 2019 France has seen a torrent of attacks which have included arson vandalism and desecration and a number of its historic Catholic churches they see the video of the preacher.
[03:56:47.840 --> 03:57:02.840]  The Palestinian cleric basically saying that France is done and that the war is now for the other European countries surrounding it. Absolutely chilling. The left will probably embrace that with open arms. Now Catholic churches throughout France are being
[03:57:02.840 --> 03:57:18.840]  desecrated. Of course police now in France are refusing to go to many of these areas such as Sandini which has 400,000 illegal immigrants because they'll get attacked. Postal services are refusing to deliver to the areas in some cases.
[03:57:18.840 --> 03:57:29.840]  Meanwhile the left tells us that Muslim no go zones are just one giant conspiracy theory. That's going to wrap it up for the show that war room with Owen Shroyer is coming up next.
