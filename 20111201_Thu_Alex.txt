[01:13.280 --> 01:16.640]  the evening I saw a bunch of mainstream news articles saying that the
[01:16.640 --> 01:21.120]  indefinite the tension of American citizens had passed well it had passed
[01:21.120 --> 01:26.040]  out a committee and looked like it was getting through without closure meaning
[01:26.040 --> 01:31.040]  that they couldn't allow debates or fellowbusters on it and it did move
[01:31.040 --> 01:36.760]  forward without amendments stripping out the bad stuff but it did not pass now
[01:36.760 --> 01:41.480]  they're they're trying to pass it today but I saw a whole bunch of articles
[01:41.480 --> 01:46.560]  yesterday saying it passed and and and generally you don't think the mainstream
[01:46.560 --> 01:51.000]  media is that bold to lie like that first they said it didn't affect citizens
[01:51.000 --> 01:54.440]  to stall people then they tried that trick of okay it already passed go to

[08:09.800 --> 08:13.280]  GCN radio network
[08:23.240 --> 08:32.000]  well here we are my friends it is all ready December 1st 2011 on this live
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.600]  Thursday edition and we're gonna be live here for at least the next three
[08:36.600 --> 08:41.640]  hours then I'll be back this evening 7 o'clock central standard time info wars
[08:41.640 --> 08:46.680]  at nightly news with some very important interviews and amazing analysis and
[08:46.680 --> 08:50.920]  reports and man on the street that we are compiling right now concerning the
[08:50.920 --> 08:57.920]  police state takeover of this country okay on Tuesday night and Wednesday
[08:57.920 --> 09:01.840]  morning I saw a bunch of articles mainstream alternative saying that in
[09:01.840 --> 09:12.120]  the Senate the NDA the National Defense Authorization Act had passed and was
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.040]  gonna go to the president and he was gonna veto it but then I noticed by
[09:16.040 --> 09:20.440]  yesterday afternoon actually read the deeper and it said the bill had passed
[09:20.440 --> 09:25.080]  without amendments through the amendment process but was now waiting for a vote
[09:25.080 --> 09:28.280]  and they have the votes to pass it they say they're gonna try to pass it today
[09:28.280 --> 09:31.960]  you can call the traders in the Senate but they're so criminal that they
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.480]  publicly say we're allowed to insider trade we're allowed to give government
[09:36.480 --> 09:41.480]  legislative money to companies our husbands and wives own we're allowed to
[09:41.480 --> 09:46.280]  have some of us double our wealth in one year many of us come here worth a few
[09:46.280 --> 09:50.160]  hundred thousand dollars and are worth tens of millions within two years that's
[09:50.160 --> 09:56.200]  completely normal it's illegal if you do it or if Martha Stewart does one one
[09:56.200 --> 10:00.600]  billionth of what we do she goes to prison but we don't because we are the
[10:00.600 --> 10:06.440]  national security criminals and they're just mid-level Aaron boys who basically
[10:06.440 --> 10:11.560]  just take orders from the lobbyist and special interest but it's a new level of
[10:11.560 --> 10:17.680]  criminal activity going on and I've always told you tyranny people always
[10:17.680 --> 10:21.280]  think is about folks that are sticking their heads up people are like well the
[10:21.280 --> 10:25.480]  government's corrupt you better shut up and go along with it no no no no no no
[10:25.480 --> 10:30.880]  idiots in history those that don't know history always think that if you lick
[10:30.880 --> 10:36.320]  boots that you're protected generally that's the most dangerous position to
[10:36.320 --> 10:41.760]  be in because there's always a lot of people that like to lick and suck
[10:41.760 --> 10:46.280]  people's boots and there's always people in black uniforms and black boots who
[10:46.280 --> 10:49.920]  like to kick your teeth in they're like go ahead and get down there okay now I'm
[10:49.920 --> 10:54.440]  gonna tee off on your mouth and you're like yes I'm your slave please and they
[10:54.440 --> 11:00.640]  they they have their way with you and and I understand a lot of new listeners
[11:00.640 --> 11:05.760]  aren't gonna believe me you've got to experience true tyranny for yourself
[11:05.760 --> 11:10.360]  first we're hoping to averted before it gets to that point but I know you won't
[11:10.360 --> 11:14.800]  believe me now so we'll make a little note while you giggle feeling self-assured
[11:14.800 --> 11:18.600]  driving along right now or whatever you're doing and then down the road
[11:18.600 --> 11:25.240]  remember the giggling like telling somebody hey if you drink a bottle of
[11:25.240 --> 11:29.040]  vodka every day you're gonna get liver failure you're like oh no I'm not in
[11:29.040 --> 11:33.240]  ten years later you get real sick and go and find out your liver's dead yeah and
[11:33.240 --> 11:38.640]  you're on a liver transplant weighing list it's kind of like that kind of like
[11:38.640 --> 11:44.440]  that or hey you better not smoke three packs of cigarettes a day don't get
[11:44.440 --> 11:48.960]  lung cancer sure enough you get 55 60 years old guess what you got big old
[11:48.960 --> 11:56.440]  lung cancer tumors okay so I'm here saying boy they're trying to get rid of
[11:56.440 --> 12:00.480]  posicum and tautus they're trying to openly allow troops all over the
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.400]  streets and now they're openly trying to get rid of it and saying by the way
[12:04.400 --> 12:08.800]  we'll arrest you torture you kill you now if you don't know why that's super
[12:08.800 --> 12:12.320]  creepy and dangerous well I don't know how to explain it to you and I'm not
[12:12.320 --> 12:15.400]  talking to our mainline longtime listeners I'm talking to new listeners
[12:15.400 --> 12:19.320]  because we're on a lot of new AM and FM stations out there and I'm not here to
[12:19.320 --> 12:25.160]  butter you up I'm not here to win a popularity contest I'm here to stop
[12:25.160 --> 12:32.440]  this generation's tyranny every generation gets it in different variants
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.200]  at different levels we've got a real nasty case the nastiest case this world
[12:38.200 --> 12:44.200]  has ever seen because the globalists call it a scientific tyranny a scientific
[12:44.200 --> 12:50.640]  dictatorship a final revolution against humanity itself to fully break the
[12:50.640 --> 12:56.160]  family break the farmer break self-sufficiency and bring in total
[12:56.160 --> 13:03.800]  domination and abject control and we've we've republished their public papers
[13:03.800 --> 13:10.640]  we've got libraries and shown you club of Rome CFR trilateral Commission and
[13:10.640 --> 13:14.480]  everything that was in their documents they're now implementing we're deep into
[13:14.480 --> 13:18.920]  the plan let's say there's 10 chapters in this book we're about six and a half
[13:18.920 --> 13:27.320]  chapters in and the last last three chapters are really really bad I mean
[13:27.320 --> 13:31.480]  this is the finale that you think stuff's bad now the last three chapters if
[13:31.480 --> 13:36.480]  they carry them out are not pretty and I'm like gee I told you we have their
[13:36.480 --> 13:40.440]  playbook and we're up to this point now this is gonna happen next just wait a
[13:40.440 --> 13:46.600]  minute okay see now that happened next secret arrest torture lamp post with
[13:46.600 --> 13:50.160]  microphones in them children being trained to tattle on their parents
[13:50.160 --> 13:54.840]  highway checkpoints federal police okay now let me tell you what comes next big
[13:54.840 --> 14:01.120]  terror attacks blamed on talk radio and conservatives and libertarians
[14:01.120 --> 14:05.720]  and they're gonna kill kids because that pulls on heartstrings they're also gonna
[14:05.720 --> 14:09.560]  massacre police and military to get them all hyped up to go out and wage war
[14:09.560 --> 14:12.760]  against the American people and then once they start trying to round up
[14:12.760 --> 14:15.800]  conservatives and libertarians conservatives and libertarians will
[14:15.800 --> 14:18.960]  fight back and that will become shelf-fulfilling that oh they are
[14:18.960 --> 14:22.720]  terrorist and a whole bunch of military and cops are gonna get killed and then
[14:22.720 --> 14:25.760]  they're gonna close ranks and march in against the people and it's gonna be
[14:25.760 --> 14:36.360]  absolute total civil war bedlam and dead people stacked ten high there are so
[14:36.360 --> 14:40.680]  many veterans who do not even like life and who want to start killing people and
[14:40.680 --> 14:46.600]  it's my job to try to stop them from doing it but let me tell you let me tell
[14:46.600 --> 14:51.600]  you the minute the steroid head swatting people try something they'll win the
[14:51.600 --> 14:55.400]  first few times with the old codgers they corner and then the old vets and
[14:55.400 --> 15:01.600]  even the younger ones are gonna go completely ape complete and that that's
[15:01.600 --> 15:05.920]  exactly what the New World Order wants sitting off-shore it's and they've got

[16:49.640 --> 16:54.040]  prison planet TV it's much more powerful on video so go to info wars calm the
[16:54.040 --> 17:00.720]  dredge report had it linked yesterday as well in red but but watching again rich
[17:00.720 --> 17:04.000]  is even more powerful but notice everything in rich says then they show
[17:04.000 --> 17:09.680]  the flip-flop of him this is a guy who said he wants to end the family and have
[17:09.680 --> 17:14.600]  a world socialist government he's a member of an actual futurist Illuminati
[17:14.600 --> 17:18.760]  group I've read his quotes here I mean he he was picked out of obscurity for a
[17:18.760 --> 17:24.200]  reason he is actually a maid initiate okay again rich is was meant to take over
[17:24.200 --> 17:31.480]  the Republican Revolution of 2094 he's meant to be a ringer for Obama now let's
[17:31.480 --> 17:36.600]  go ahead and play this Ron Paul video let's get this out to everybody here it
[17:36.600 --> 17:46.600]  is I think this is the core challenge of America is that beyond the words is a
[17:46.600 --> 17:52.200]  real question of policy and a real question of values and a real question
[17:52.200 --> 18:00.360]  of seriousness the real question of policy we don't always see eye-to-eye do
[18:00.360 --> 18:05.040]  we knew no but we do agree our country must take action to address climate
[18:05.040 --> 18:09.480]  change Newt Gingrich has been on both sides of a long list of issues sometimes
[18:09.480 --> 18:14.840]  in the same week I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more
[18:14.840 --> 18:20.040]  desirable than left-wing social internet with allies like that it cuts Paul Ryan
[18:20.040 --> 18:25.120]  off at the knees it supports the Obama administration there is no explanation
[18:25.120 --> 18:30.120]  for it and a real question of value question of value if you want to put
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.400]  people in jail let's look at the politicians who created the environment
[18:33.400 --> 18:36.920]  the politicians who profited from the environment politicians who profited
[18:36.920 --> 18:40.160]  from the environment Newt Gingrich on the defense for taking one and a half
[18:40.160 --> 18:43.880]  million bucks after he left Congress Freddie Mac paid Gingrich at least one
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.040]  point six million dollars six million dollars some of it just before the
[18:48.040 --> 18:52.680]  housing market collapsed Newt Gingrich can ridicule Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
[18:52.680 --> 18:57.560]  publicly while privately pocketing millions that's hardcore lobbying and
[18:57.560 --> 19:00.800]  that's what Newt Gingrich was doing the politicians who profited from the
[19:00.800 --> 19:04.640]  environment there are now reports about controversial ties to the health care
[19:04.640 --> 19:09.680]  industry a think tank founded by Newt Gingrich collected at least 37 million
[19:09.680 --> 19:13.640]  dollars from major health care companies the group supports individual
[19:13.640 --> 19:17.480]  mandate Newt Gingrich renewed his support for an individual mandate a key
[19:17.480 --> 19:21.680]  tenant of President Obama's health care law support for an individual mandate
[19:21.680 --> 19:25.720]  folks don't ask me to explain this and a real question is serious the serious
[19:25.720 --> 19:32.240]  questions seriousness everything that Gingrich railed against when he was in
[19:32.240 --> 19:36.840]  the house he went the other way when he got paid to go the other way you're in
[19:36.840 --> 19:40.880]  embarrassment your heart he's flipped and flopped based on who's paying him
[19:40.880 --> 19:44.840]  is demonstrating himself to be the very essence of the Washington insiders it's
[19:44.840 --> 19:50.400]  about serial hypocrisy it's wrong to go around and adopt radically different
[19:50.400 --> 19:55.720]  positions and people have to ask themselves will you tell me next time

[24:25.520 --> 24:34.280]  coming to shoot me down so I shot him and that's what Stuart Rhodes talked
[24:34.280 --> 24:37.520]  about last night with us we're gonna play 10 minutes from M4's nightly news
[24:37.520 --> 24:41.520]  coming up later in the hour or Stuart Rhodes has never talked like this he
[24:41.520 --> 24:50.240]  said we're basically two minutes to midnight 1774 1775 and this is what
[24:50.240 --> 24:56.000]  Alexander Shultz and Ethan talked about when the NKVD the domestic KGB in this
[24:56.000 --> 25:00.920]  case it was Leningrad had arrested about half the city in a year raping women
[25:00.920 --> 25:04.160]  killing children and people were just waiting their houses shivering to be
[25:04.160 --> 25:08.680]  picked up next by a few thousand secret police and Shultz and Ethan got picked up
[25:08.680 --> 25:12.800]  by him and lived decades in a slave camp near the Arctic Circle and he talked
[25:12.800 --> 25:18.720]  later or how they burned with anger that they hadn't waited with hatchets and
[25:18.720 --> 25:22.240]  hokers and knives down in the basement you know down in the entryway when the
[25:22.240 --> 25:25.440]  secret police came because the whole organ of the state would have ground to
[25:25.440 --> 25:29.520]  a halt in minutes if they would have taken action I'm not saying that's the
[25:29.520 --> 25:35.960]  case but the system is planning to basically come after people just like in
[25:35.960 --> 25:40.920]  the Bob Marley song where Sheriff John Brown comes down the road to shooting
[25:40.920 --> 25:45.000]  and he's Sheriff John Brown's pulling his gun what are you gonna do and the
[25:45.000 --> 25:49.320]  globalists know what they're doing they've got actuary psychological profiles
[25:49.320 --> 25:52.920]  they've trained the military and police prepare for war with libertarians and
[25:52.920 --> 25:57.920]  conservatives and they're going to even provocateur it if they have to stage
[25:57.920 --> 26:01.960]  events and then send the military and police in against people who are going
[26:01.960 --> 26:06.160]  to then fight back and it's gonna be horrible and it's not good for the
[26:06.160 --> 26:09.480]  domestic security forces that have been maneuvered into this position and it's
[26:09.480 --> 26:13.000]  not good for the American people we need to bring the banksters to justice
[26:13.000 --> 26:16.560]  there's only a couple hundred of them they've all committed crimes publicly
[26:16.560 --> 26:21.280]  they run the New World Order I'm gonna go to Watson for this segment part of
[26:21.280 --> 26:24.480]  the next and he'll be gone soon because he's working on a big report he joins us
[26:24.480 --> 26:28.420]  from England we do have Max Kaiser on the latest on the economy in the last
[26:28.420 --> 26:32.200]  30 minutes presidential candidate Gary Johnson Republicans gonna be joining us
[26:32.200 --> 26:37.120]  as well but right now let's go to Paul Watson Paul Watson has the headline
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.760]  Chinese General Threatens Third World War to protect Iran that was an earlier
[26:42.760 --> 26:46.000]  variant of the report there's also professors and other officials saying
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.960]  it here's another one Chinese government official US threat to Pakistan is
[26:49.960 --> 26:53.640]  threat to China we've seen Russian Saber rattling moving ships into the
[26:53.640 --> 26:59.400]  Mediterranean up against Syria blocking routes for NATO in to Afghanistan
[26:59.400 --> 27:04.080]  Pakistan doing the same thing I mean this it's like a general homie ghoul said
[27:04.080 --> 27:07.360]  yesterday former head of Pakistani intelligence it's as if the people running
[27:07.360 --> 27:12.840]  America want to destroy us and that is the plan they let's go to Paul Watson
[27:12.840 --> 27:18.280]  Paul Watson a breakdown your wife is lives in England live there many years
[27:18.280 --> 27:22.360]  but she is from China speaks fluent Chinese and she helped you go through
[27:22.360 --> 27:27.160]  the Chinese national news with what they're saying right now and this is not
[27:27.160 --> 27:30.920]  getting any attention in the US this is breaking news tell us about these key
[27:30.920 --> 27:38.800]  reports by Paul Joseph Watson and Ian well Alex the first report was Chinese
[27:38.800 --> 27:42.680]  General Threatens Third World War to protect Iran and that's a quote Third
[27:42.680 --> 27:47.320]  World War and it turns out that this guy is not only a professor he's also a
[27:47.320 --> 27:52.280]  highly decorated general he's won prestigious awards he's been an
[27:52.280 --> 27:58.080]  advisor on top Chinese military panels he's also a key military expert for
[27:58.080 --> 28:03.800]  Chinese state media and he basically came out and said that quote China will
[28:03.800 --> 28:09.360]  not hesitate to protect Iran even with a Third World War and that was discussed
[28:09.360 --> 28:15.120]  by other people in the Chinese media then we had a separate report which we
[28:15.120 --> 28:19.600]  found in the Chinese media which was not in the English language media so it's
[28:19.600 --> 28:25.800]  an English language media exclusive which is out of China's central television
[28:25.800 --> 28:30.840]  and it's actually the website Zhong Shijia which reports that and that's a
[28:30.840 --> 28:34.680]  military news website which is well respected in China for talking about
[28:34.680 --> 28:39.840]  military developments and this is a separate unnamed government official
[28:39.840 --> 28:46.240]  who said quote any threat to Pakistan is a threat to China and it turns out that
[28:46.240 --> 28:52.360]  in response to US troops massing on the border of Pakistan of course on Sunday
[28:52.360 --> 28:57.520]  we had the NATO bombing on Pakistan troops in response to those US troops
[28:57.520 --> 29:02.960]  massing China in a in a massive war game that only just finished a few days
[29:02.960 --> 29:09.200]  ago sent their second artillery artillery PLA troops armed with
[29:09.200 --> 29:15.040]  these sophisticated tactical defense missiles to northwestern China just
[29:15.040 --> 29:19.720]  outside the border with Pakistan and had this massive joint war game with the
[29:19.720 --> 29:23.920]  Pakistani military so we'll get further into it after the break yeah stay there
[29:23.920 --> 29:29.000]  so you got national Chinese television the top military advisor former general
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.200]  and see how prisonplanet.com takes the headline the mainstream media would
[29:33.200 --> 29:37.920]  have top Chinese general threatens nuclear war but we always hold back by
[29:37.920 --> 29:42.880]  the time we're done with it it's Chinese government official US threat to
[29:42.880 --> 29:51.160]  Pakistan is threat to China we'll be right back we're on the march the

[34:21.800 --> 34:25.840]  political but where there's smoke there's fire I can take one look at the way
[34:25.840 --> 34:30.800]  Herman Kane behaves how he acts where he works and the fact that he's lied
[34:30.800 --> 34:36.520]  about Ron Paul and been caught lying he lies very well how dare you say I call
[34:36.520 --> 34:41.440]  people done that want to audit the Fed I have never said any such thing this is
[34:41.440 --> 34:45.920]  ridiculous you shouldn't believe what you see on the internet and Ron Paul goes
[34:45.920 --> 34:49.960]  really of course it's in Kane's book and he said it over and over again when
[34:49.960 --> 34:58.240]  he's guest hosting for Neil warts so that's what's going on that's what's
[34:58.240 --> 35:02.680]  happening and you notice most these neo-con talk show hosts will not
[35:02.680 --> 35:10.560]  criticize people like Newt Gennrich who you might as well have Al Gore in fact
[35:10.560 --> 35:16.280]  Al Gore would be better because he's basically the same type person complete
[35:16.280 --> 35:22.720]  with you know the same personal activities but you know it's Al Gore
[35:22.720 --> 35:29.080]  with Newt Gennrich he's got all these Sean Hannity lap dogs and people I think
[35:29.080 --> 35:33.760]  I was visiting my parents last night and I was a second hour long interview with
[35:33.760 --> 35:39.440]  Newt Gennrich with Sean Hannity with those painted on eyebrows sitting there
[35:39.440 --> 35:45.040]  you're playing the part of leave it to beaver going gee gee dad how are you
[35:45.040 --> 35:49.160]  going to save us in Gennrich sitting there just lying at people and acting
[35:49.160 --> 35:55.440]  like the smart grandfather when he is a Larsonist anti-American sworn to
[35:55.440 --> 36:03.320]  destroy this country globalist who just supports everything and of course he
[36:03.320 --> 36:07.760]  supported single-payer you heard those clips we played earlier that's because
[36:07.760 --> 36:14.400]  the insurance lobby gave him 37 million dollars just to go around and promote it
[36:14.400 --> 36:18.440]  on TV and call it conservative the guy has press conferences with Hillary
[36:18.440 --> 36:28.320]  Clinton thirty seven million dollars thirty seven million dollars to Gennrich
[36:28.320 --> 36:36.800]  the Warthog alone because the insurance companies on record wrote the health
[36:36.800 --> 36:42.080]  care bill out of the Mitt Romney style scam he wrote the original model which
[36:42.080 --> 36:47.120]  they wrote it just he's the one he brought forward because it makes 35
[36:47.120 --> 36:51.200]  million people buy insurance from them and allows insurance companies to tell
[36:51.200 --> 36:56.400]  doctors what type of treatment they can give that's the death panel and it's on
[36:56.400 --> 37:01.320]  you're gonna buy it and we're gonna set the health care got it and here's
[37:01.320 --> 37:06.160]  newt Gennrich and you know what you don't like him you got Mitt Romney the
[37:06.160 --> 37:09.360]  new world order took over because they're deceptive the new world order took
[37:09.360 --> 37:12.840]  over because they know how to control both parties and whoever they're
[37:12.840 --> 37:17.480]  promoting is gonna sell you out so we've got China talking about nuclear war with
[37:17.480 --> 37:20.920]  the US we've got Russia threatening to attack Eastern Europe if missiles are
[37:20.920 --> 37:25.120]  moved in there we've got aircraft carriers with nukes showing up we've got
[37:25.120 --> 37:28.280]  Europe imploding into a bank of the world they're saying oh the IMF and
[37:28.280 --> 37:32.560]  World Bank will now take over the planet this contagion will spread to America I
[37:32.560 --> 37:37.440]  saw that in the news this morning here's the statesman Fed brokers deal to aid
[37:37.440 --> 37:44.000]  Europe it should read North American arm of private banking cartel aides its
[37:44.000 --> 37:51.840]  European subsidiary which is the main head subsidiary but you've got people
[37:51.840 --> 37:55.840]  that just have no idea that the fellow reserves private they have no idea which
[37:55.840 --> 38:00.560]  end is up and they're just wrong oh thank goodness the Fed is saving Europe
[38:00.560 --> 38:06.240]  which is tax money we're gonna have to pay oh goody goody gumdrops aren't we
[38:06.240 --> 38:10.840]  aren't we just in a wonderful position aren't I'm going back to Watson here so
[38:10.840 --> 38:14.560]  no I'm not going to talk about Herman Cain and this woman who looks very
[38:14.560 --> 38:19.320]  credible compared to the others and his thousands of phone calls to her now
[38:19.320 --> 38:24.480]  including just a few weeks ago and 415 in the morning and by the way the media
[38:24.480 --> 38:28.520]  found out about her the media went to her that's now been confirmed people blew
[38:28.520 --> 38:34.200]  the whistle Herman Cain for almost 14 years has been snuggling up to her and
[38:34.200 --> 38:39.360]  and and and you know what if he went public and admitted he'd done it it
[38:39.360 --> 38:43.160]  would not I mean I'm not in condoning her saying it's a great thing but it's
[38:43.160 --> 38:48.560]  it's human you know King David had his buddy and best friends sent off on a
[38:48.560 --> 38:52.440]  death mission because he lusted after his wife but his heart was right he
[38:52.440 --> 38:57.360]  repented and and God said you're a man at your own heart I'm not judging Herman
[38:57.360 --> 39:02.400]  Cain for that the fact that he is the best liar I've probably ever seen I mean
[39:02.400 --> 39:07.000]  when he told Ron Paul Ron Paul was a liar I thought man I've heard him say
[39:07.000 --> 39:10.520]  that I've it doesn't his book say that but I had to go check I'm like man that
[39:10.520 --> 39:15.200]  was convincing sure enough he's a liar so when he said I have not been with any
[39:15.200 --> 39:20.960]  women and done nothing inappropriate it is all a lie he was committed and you
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.080]  better believe there's gonna be more and more women that come out more and more
[39:25.080 --> 39:30.480]  women from all those little special you know corporate events at hotels and
[39:30.480 --> 39:35.120]  that's what Fortune 500 is like they're constantly in hotels and it's just a
[39:35.120 --> 39:40.800]  place for the different branches of the companies to all have sex with each other
[39:40.800 --> 39:45.840]  that's what goes on in America and you know maybe Herman Cain's in trouble
[39:45.840 --> 39:49.360]  because he didn't it wasn't little kids or something then in little kids the
[39:49.360 --> 39:55.480]  media probably would have covered it up like ESPN but that's he's bad because
[39:55.480 --> 39:59.600]  he's a Federal Reserve former head of probably the second or third most
[39:59.600 --> 40:02.920]  powerful it goes New York Kansas City or Dallas you can argue which one's most
[40:02.920 --> 40:09.360]  powerful after the New York Fed he's a globalist he doesn't tell you it's 9 9
[40:09.360 --> 40:14.000]  9 9 with the payroll tax and that they can jack up all those nines or that it's
[40:14.000 --> 40:17.400]  always been the Bankster plan that I've been telling you about for 16 years to
[40:17.400 --> 40:23.600]  push a fair tax and at the end of the day still keep the income tax at 9% and
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.400]  have the federal government involved in sales taxes and excise can you imagine a
[40:28.400 --> 40:34.080]  VAT all right I'm gonna shut up go back to Paul Watson again start from the
[40:34.080 --> 40:39.680]  beginning recap this Paul you're gonna have the floor here and then our part of
[40:39.680 --> 40:43.920]  our interview with an amazing 45 almost 50 minute interview with the head of
[40:43.920 --> 40:47.880]  Oath Keepers last night Stuart Rhodes where he started talking about Ron Paul
[40:47.880 --> 40:51.400]  when he first met him in 98 came in for the interview he's at top of his class
[40:51.400 --> 40:56.880]  at Yale wrote an award-winning document on military internment and Stuart Rhodes
[40:56.880 --> 40:59.640]  started you know got a little teary-eyed so did I was talking about Ron Paul
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.240]  behind the scenes you know basically being ground down and you know we've
[41:03.240 --> 41:06.360]  got to save the Republic and be in the same guy behind the scenes he is in
[41:06.360 --> 41:10.240]  public but just an amazing interview the whole things at prison planet dot TV but
[41:10.240 --> 41:14.800]  going back there's two articles to be clear Chinese government official US
[41:14.800 --> 41:19.720]  threat to Pakistan is threat to China and the other one Chinese government
[41:19.720 --> 41:23.920]  official got that double printed and the second article Chinese general
[41:23.920 --> 41:29.440]  threatens world war to protect Iran or Pakistan they're also saying that so that
[41:29.440 --> 41:34.320]  those articles are linked in red at info wars.com and prison planet.com this is
[41:34.320 --> 41:39.360]  exclusive this article is the first one translated into English we have links to
[41:39.360 --> 41:45.000]  it it's by Paul Joseph Watson in Eon now Paul Watson you've got the floor break
[41:45.000 --> 41:50.600]  it down well the first article was a Chinese general and he's he's called
[41:50.600 --> 41:58.760]  Zhang Jiao Zhong and he's he's a well-respected well-known naval general
[41:58.760 --> 42:03.080]  he's in the military and he's also an analyst for TV he's received numerous
[42:03.080 --> 42:07.600]  awards and you can go watch the video there's a there's a subtitles on it in
[42:07.600 --> 42:12.440]  English and he says quote China will not hesitate to protect Iran even with a
[42:12.440 --> 42:18.920]  third world war so that came out this morning and as I noted in that article
[42:18.920 --> 42:24.840]  China is talking about Iran we've just had the latest naval update map which
[42:24.840 --> 42:30.000]  shows you where the aircraft carriers are going and the USS Carl Vincent
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.840]  aircraft carrier which is the same one that bin Laden's body was supposedly
[42:34.840 --> 42:39.760]  aboard has just deployed from the United States and it's going to join the US
[42:39.760 --> 42:45.760]  Fifth Fleet is going to join the Stennis immediately outside the territorial
[42:45.760 --> 42:54.160]  waters of Iran so two massive warships not just to actually NBC reports that
[42:54.160 --> 42:59.360]  it's going to be accompanied by a guided missile cruiser the USS Bunker Hill and
[42:59.360 --> 43:04.560]  a guided missile destroyer the USS Halsey so you've got three US warships
[43:04.560 --> 43:10.280]  heading for Iranian territorial waters so that was the first report about Iran
[43:10.280 --> 43:16.880]  the second report was from a Chinese new news website called Jung Shijia and
[43:16.880 --> 43:22.200]  that cited a report by China's Central Television where this unnamed government
[43:22.200 --> 43:26.920]  officials said quote any threat to Pakistan is a threat to China and he
[43:26.920 --> 43:31.920]  said that in response to the fact that US troops of course already in Afghanistan
[43:31.920 --> 43:38.000]  are massing on the border of Pakistan China sees that as an act of aggression
[43:38.000 --> 43:43.120]  because it's obviously got a very close alliance with Pakistan in fact in China
[43:43.120 --> 43:48.680]  they describe it as a quote brotherhood and in a quote from this article is quote
[43:48.680 --> 43:53.360]  China will never be in peace if Pakistan is lost so they obviously think that the
[43:53.360 --> 43:57.680]  United States is about to attack Pakistan they've got troops massing on the
[43:57.680 --> 44:02.400]  border they've just had a massive joint military exercise with Pakistan which
[44:02.400 --> 44:08.320]  included the latest most sophisticated Chinese tactical missiles that took place
[44:08.320 --> 44:12.480]  on the border of Pakistan and now they're saying of course in the aftermath of
[44:12.480 --> 44:17.440]  the NATO bombing which killed the Pakistan soldiers if America attacks
[44:17.440 --> 44:21.000]  Pakistan then they're going to be ready because they're already having war games
[44:21.000 --> 44:25.320]  based around that premise so we got a major escalation in hostilities
[44:25.320 --> 44:29.880]  obviously we've got the serious situation ongoing which of course China and
[44:29.880 --> 44:34.920]  Russia have said they don't want they're not going to support a UN mandate for a
[44:34.920 --> 44:39.440]  humanitarian intervention you've got Russian warships now in Syrian
[44:39.440 --> 44:44.520]  territorial waters you've got the Russians giving Syria anti-aircraft
[44:44.520 --> 44:51.760]  missile technology so I've never seen the rhetoric so heated as it has been for
[44:51.760 --> 44:58.560]  the past few weeks Syria Iran Pakistan it's all coming to a head and notice now
[44:58.560 --> 45:03.640]  Paul all of this is happening just as we said it would and Salenta and countless
[45:03.640 --> 45:10.480]  others Paul Craig Roberts get standard during a big globalist move to go ahead
[45:10.480 --> 45:15.240]  and implode the economy and then launch a war on top of that and they've already
[45:15.240 --> 45:19.760]  launched proxy al-Qaeda forces all over the world they're running their proxy
[45:19.760 --> 45:23.400]  armies right up to the borders of China right up to the borders of Russia they
[45:23.400 --> 45:28.560]  know they're already getting ready to have proxy groups in those breakaway
[45:28.560 --> 45:34.560]  republics and other demilitarized zones like South Ossetia and Eucasia I mean
[45:34.560 --> 45:39.720]  this is really the banksters going for the world while they suck America dry and
[45:39.720 --> 45:44.680]  destroy our name in the process of having us do their dirty work I mean it's
[45:44.680 --> 45:51.240]  really happening and what's scary is the globalists are insane I mean their
[45:51.240 --> 45:54.760]  masterminds they've carried this out they've had the will to do it they've
[45:54.760 --> 45:59.640]  had the foresight but at the same time you catch them making 20 to 1 40 to 100
[45:59.640 --> 46:07.000]  to 1 bets at MF global and and at other big firms like Goldman Sachs I mean it
[46:07.000 --> 46:11.800]  these really are people who think they're invincible or in their own words
[46:11.800 --> 46:15.680]  even if they aren't invincible they're still gonna try it and they've got our
[46:15.680 --> 46:20.080]  military under their control and they're so brazen same thing in England
[46:20.080 --> 46:23.840]  they're coming out saying there as well will arrest citizens and disappear you
[46:23.840 --> 46:28.440]  whenever we want we'll do the same thing here will torture I mean it's all the
[46:28.440 --> 46:32.880]  same propaganda they are just putting forward a face of pure authoritarianism
[46:32.880 --> 46:37.480]  worldwide not saying China or Russia are good either the point is they're not the
[46:37.480 --> 46:42.160]  ones just totally taking over and then you find out the very same elite that
[46:42.160 --> 46:46.800]  are doing this are heavily invested in China and are playing some weird double
[46:46.800 --> 46:52.280]  game and maybe they do want to destroy the US maybe maybe we're not meant to
[46:52.280 --> 46:56.160]  come out of this you see this is very sophisticated Paul what do you think's
[46:56.160 --> 47:02.160]  going on here well there's unda I mean in China there's this worship of anyone
[47:02.160 --> 47:05.640]  in a position of authority and if you think it's bad in America then it's
[47:05.640 --> 47:11.160]  even worse in China so a lot of the Chinese elite think they're in bed with
[47:11.160 --> 47:14.440]  the Anglo-American elite so they think they're all on the same team but
[47:14.440 --> 47:18.520]  obviously people in certain positions of power have got different ideas and I
[47:18.520 --> 47:24.280]  presumed that a lot of those people are in the Chinese military but there's also
[47:24.280 --> 47:28.960]  an addendum which is the fight we was we were talking about Iran China's
[47:28.960 --> 47:35.400]  ambassador actually went to the UN and not to the UN to the IAEA this is China's
[47:35.400 --> 47:41.160]  ambassador to the UN who is a Japanese fellow called Yukio Amano he's at the
[47:41.160 --> 47:45.800]  IAEA and the Chinese ambassador basically said look don't produce any fake
[47:45.800 --> 47:49.720]  evidence to just define attack on Iran because we're gonna out it he said
[47:49.720 --> 47:53.840]  don't produce any unfounded evidence on Iran because we're gonna oppose it so
[47:53.840 --> 47:57.480]  they're even aware of the fact that they could be waiting to stage some fake
[47:57.480 --> 48:01.680]  evidence to go in there regarding that well let's not forget that almost five
[48:01.680 --> 48:06.240]  years ago Raymond Governor said that he thought they'd probably stage a new
[48:06.240 --> 48:10.120]  Gulf of Tonkin in the Persian Gulf to attack Iran and then we learned that a
[48:10.120 --> 48:12.720]  few months later that very thing happened and we didn't learn for over a
[48:12.720 --> 48:16.880]  year and a half that it had in New Yorker magazine Cy Hirsch that they were
[48:16.880 --> 48:22.000]  already painting up patrol boats to have Navy Seals drive up and stage an
[48:22.000 --> 48:25.600]  attack on one of our ships and then we learned they even tried it with a radio
[48:25.600 --> 48:29.560]  and some blue boats probably actually implemented it but the blue boats turned
[48:29.560 --> 48:34.560]  away I mean we're dealing with very dangerous people very very dangerous
[48:34.560 --> 48:39.520]  people who could do anything and the very same people that ran Bush and Cheney
[48:39.520 --> 48:43.000]  are running Obama right now
[48:43.000 --> 48:48.360]  well I'm on the bombers just reads the celli prompts if you read the background
[48:48.360 --> 48:51.720]  into Obama you know that he's just an empty vessel he didn't even write his
[48:51.720 --> 48:58.400]  own book but I mean yes it may the level of evil makes China and Russia look
[48:58.400 --> 49:02.800]  like the good guys I mean that's how bad it's got and we have to go to Russian
[49:02.800 --> 49:07.480]  and Chinese state media at least to get you know half the story because the US
[49:07.480 --> 49:11.960]  corporate media barely gives you 1% so that's that's the level that it's got
[49:11.960 --> 49:16.800]  to and now I mean the Federal Reserve comes in and comes to the rescue and
[49:16.800 --> 49:21.800]  saves Europe what did they do they the CNBC admits they just went in they
[49:21.800 --> 49:26.680]  didn't print the money they typed it into a screen using a keyboard and gave
[49:26.680 --> 49:31.880]  dollars to your they bled the dollar to keep the euro on life support for
[49:31.880 --> 49:36.600]  another 10 days and it's just yeah Ben Benaki to the rescue once again so it's
[49:36.600 --> 49:40.880]  just the level of evil and the level of denial of it is what's going to sink
[49:40.880 --> 49:46.200]  America and I mean it's already turning into a post-soviet union style
[49:46.200 --> 49:49.840]  collapse with the record number of people on food stamps the employment and
[49:49.840 --> 49:56.120]  everything so when people say that this is the era of China and the East and
[49:56.120 --> 50:01.800]  the brick developing economies like Brazil and China and others then we can
[50:01.800 --> 50:05.280]  see it unfolding right in front of us with the very actions of the Federal
[50:05.280 --> 50:09.600]  Reserve yesterday that's right the globalist have used America bankrupted
[50:09.600 --> 50:14.080]  America never upgraded into the infrastructure stole everything and now
[50:14.080 --> 50:18.760]  we're just this husk of military power that's winding down and rotting and the

[54:17.860 --> 54:25.400]  Rhodes last night and he stated it correctly he basically said that the
[54:25.400 --> 54:29.320]  National Defense Authorization Act is a declaration of war against the American
[54:29.320 --> 54:39.040]  people by Northcom by the captured US military forces by the megabanks that
[54:39.040 --> 54:44.080]  control them the military industrial complex has slowly been investing in
[54:44.080 --> 54:48.040]  the prisons and the surveillance of the militarization of police and the training
[54:48.040 --> 54:52.880]  and the ran corporation and the drones and the checkpoints and military

[55:25.840 --> 55:29.080]  try to resist the people trying to throw them out and then this is a
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.960]  occupation this is a banker occupation look at Europe they don't debate it they
[55:33.960 --> 55:37.440]  come out and they say Goldman Sachs has conquered Europe I'd probably seen that
[55:37.440 --> 55:44.960]  headline 30 times in major publications Financial Times BBC Time Magazine Forbes

[01:00:00.440 --> 01:00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:19.720]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:32.320]  Alex Jones all right my friends we are live thank you so much for joining us
[01:00:32.320 --> 01:00:40.120]  we're into hour number two you have Gary Johnson joining us Republican
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.880]  presidential candidate you know I want to get his view on some of the other
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.120]  candidates as well how the media is ignoring Ron Paul and of course Gary
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.720]  Johnson as well who's certainly better than many of the other candidates you
[01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:56.000]  know after Ron Paul Gary Johnson it's pretty good guy I'm sorry to say I don't
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.840]  agree with some of his open border issues because you can't have a libertarian
[01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:03.680]  open border when they're being put on welfare and I know he's against that
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:08.880]  welfare but the point is it is what it is I mean six plus billion people want to
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.800]  come here and then they become anti-gun voters because they see the Democratic
[01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:18.480]  Party giving them all these free goodies as their buddy boy and then they're
[01:01:18.480 --> 01:01:23.120]  taught liberation theology all CIA Ford Foundation run divide and conquer
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:30.280]  British model great game Balkanization divide and rule playing us off against
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:41.080]  each other atomization strategies now also coming up in the news he worked on
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.120]  this for like three days and we need to shoot a video about it because it's so
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:50.640]  important secret US-Canada border deal it's bad enough it basically merges the
[01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:54.280]  three countries in the security prosperity partnership continental security
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.560]  perimeter but it also hides a GMO takeover now the US is already a
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:05.200]  biological weapons waste dump of dying bees and other species and highest
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.280]  cancer rates worldwide fertility plunging all under the genetic warfare
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:14.320]  operation but now under this deal Canada and Mexico have to let the goodie
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:20.600]  goods in US-Canada agreement beyond just borders streamlines and harmonizes
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:29.280]  food and auto regulations under North American Union corporate agenda we got
[01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:32.960]  the SPP documents and what a rosetta stone of how they operate from four
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:37.720]  years ago we cover it in game but just every decisions made at these corporate
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:42.360]  roundtables where the heads of the bureaucracy the heads of the federal
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.520]  departments of all three countries are there same thing in Europe and they are
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:51.000]  told what to do by the corporate bosses they all have votes they gavel and they
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.600]  turn to them they say implement and a report is issued and they this is on
[01:02:54.600 --> 01:03:01.560]  record they literally and at the top of the report it's keep this secret I mean
[01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:05.520]  that incredible Banff Canada meeting is number one this must be kept secret the
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.920]  North American Union integration program to succeed must stay secret number two
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:18.720]  crises are key flu crises for merger of nations crime crises for merger of
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:25.960]  nations terror crises for merger of nations and of course financial crises
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:36.760]  was it financial crime terror and they had one more financial crime terror so
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:45.160]  busy doing the voice I didn't see financial crime terror oh yeah in
[01:03:45.160 --> 01:03:51.120]  biological that was it so I already said it so so I mean go read it it's public
[01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:56.120]  judicial watch got it I mean it it's a total lawless takeover but it's not a
[01:03:56.120 --> 01:04:00.480]  guy like Mussolini in an outfit that looks like a clown you know with with
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:04.520]  riding boots on or jackboats or or Hitler running around looking like a
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:10.840]  complete idiot or Stalin or something looking like a complete moron you know
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:16.400]  that's from another character to a time this is a group of corporate criminals
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:22.240]  who who get certifications and boards and agreements and direct things but then
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:26.520]  always have have had diversified responsibility so that no one can ever
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:31.040]  be blamed oh the computer Robo signed and took your house that we programmed oh
[01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:35.960]  the computer stole the election oh the drone is gonna act on its own and bombs
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:42.000]  you so again these criminals have learned how to engage in white-collar
[01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:47.720]  crime and get away with it by always fogging up who's really behind it and
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:52.040]  so now it's just tyranny by that and they have some teleprompter reader up
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:55.400]  there who takes all the blame and then the next teleprompter readers brought in

[01:09:51.360 --> 01:09:56.880]  want to start shutting down free speech and other information now I'm gonna go
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.880]  to this clip from Stuart Rhodes we're gonna come back from break the founder
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:04.240]  of Oath Keepers and we're gonna talk about what he discusses in this 10
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:07.920]  minutes from the 50 minute interview I did last night in full wars nightly
[01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:12.640]  news it's posted in full at prison planet dot TV but he's never talked like
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:18.000]  this about the systems declaring war on us that's what they have done with us
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.200]  bill they're trying to pass right now it has passed without amendment so far to
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.280]  allow secret grabbing of Americans that literally disappear executed torture
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:30.480]  they've got huge armies of paramilitary people that would love Jack Bauer and
[01:10:30.480 --> 01:10:33.160]  want to torture conservatives and libertarians they think it's cute and
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:37.320]  funny I've shown you training manuals where main line conservative groups are
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:43.440]  called terrorist libertarians Charles Key state rep wanting to invest in
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:48.600]  Oklahoma City listed as a terrorist I mean of course I don't recognize they
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.880]  actually work for the terrorist they don't get that so it's on the bankers
[01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.760]  want to stage events to bring this in so here's a 10 minute excerpt of the
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:02.160]  interview with Stuart Rhodes and then we're gonna come back and break down the
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:08.800]  fact that the system wants to orchestrate a conflict and they want to force
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.760]  people into a position of the government being Wallace and so people
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:17.160]  basically have a civil war in this nation it's part of the order out of
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:23.000]  chaos strategy so we've got to find another way out of this before it's too
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.840]  late here it is
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:34.280]  you know so far politics has failed us and really I think that once you have
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.920]  this this act in place and they start to use it then you then you're talking
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:43.800]  about you know having crossed the Rubicon and now you're like 1774 you're
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:48.000]  on the eve of conflict that's where you are and the only real question then is
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.800]  a matter of time and how it's gonna go and how do you maintain the moral
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:54.880]  high ground which our founding fathers did I do urge people to take a very
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:00.160]  close look at our history they were pushed again and again and again until
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:04.000]  they finally had to fight back because they came for their weapons and that's
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.240]  what's gonna happen in this country if they pass this bill the next step will
[01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.680]  be they put all the all the pieces of the puzzle in place and then they need
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.120]  an excuse for a pretext if you talked about many times then there'll be a
[01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.960]  domestic terrorist attack or something like that will happen and they'll start
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.400]  rounding at people when they get to that point and such to happen you will
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:25.080]  have no recourse but to fight same place that's also needs and was in when he
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:29.520]  talked about how they burned in the camps later lamenting the fact that they
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:33.760]  waited and they did not fight back that's where we will be but we're not Russia
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:38.280]  we're not Germany we're not in Nazi Germany good little Germans there is a
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.720]  sizable portion of the population in this country who are not gonna take it
[01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:48.040]  and who are gonna fight back well story you're right and the globalists have
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.880]  miscalculated I mean when you see Corazon making 40 to 1 bets with his
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:56.120]  with people's private bank accounts and this is the main economic advisor to
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:00.520]  Obama these are mentally ill people they've got actuaries they've got think
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:05.520]  tanks they've got political scientists telling them what moves to make but
[01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:09.080]  they're not going to be able to carry this out there is at least 30% of the
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:13.880]  population that when they see others overrun and arrested and then tortured
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.800]  and trotted out all drugged up could be you could be me we're gonna go off and
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:23.080]  I want to tell the military and police the globalists are gonna sit offshore and
[01:13:23.080 --> 01:13:27.880]  watch you get chewed up in a fight with the American people it's very important
[01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:32.760]  that police and military really make a decision now which side they're gonna be
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:37.000]  on because this is a decision this is a decision for all the marbles their
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.200]  family their country everything the tyrants we have running things I've
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.600]  studied the different tyrannies is so absolutely wicked and hateful I mean
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:51.600]  it's not some boss on corruption steward your comments on that no you're
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:54.960]  correct and that is their Achilles heel and that's why I found it out keepers
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:01.440]  the military you're right choose now who you shall serve either you are I'm
[01:14:01.440 --> 01:14:04.800]  talking the military out there especially either you are a son of the
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.800]  republic and you will defend the bill of rights and the Constitution or you are
[01:14:09.800 --> 01:14:13.800]  a traitor to your country and you are nothing but a but a lowly dog an
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:19.280]  obedient dog to the powers that be choose now whom you shall serve well you
[01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:23.200]  know that's what's so disgusting about this dirt it's not fun being right it's
[01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:28.760]  not fun that we've been proven correct it's very sick and and the pace it's
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:35.240]  moving is so quick and so naked now undoubtedly I mean look at fast and
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:39.280]  furious they got caught shipping tens of thousands of guns into Mexico so they
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:43.960]  had CBS release oh we allowed some to be sold at a few gun shops course it came
[01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:49.360]  out it was drugs being shipped in the US by the ATF FBI DEA Border Patrol Coast
[01:14:49.360 --> 01:14:54.120]  Guard you name it and several other federal agencies it was tens of thousands
[01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:58.240]  of guns not just shipped out of the country but to Honduras Mexico Illinois
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:03.160]  Indiana Florida to gangs that were killing other gangs and you find out our
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:08.640]  government literally is a mafia at at the top of drug dealing criminals and you
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:13.440]  find out they really did stage Oklahoma City you find out they really did do all
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:16.960]  I mean people need to understand I mean we're not just sitting here demonizing
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:21.560]  people we don't like I don't have words to her for my study to describe just how
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.960]  nasty these people are and I don't think people understand it's like like you
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:28.960]  said Schultz and Eaton said what would have happened if we had met the secret
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.560]  police with hatchets and pokers you know when they came to grab people you know
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.120]  half the city wouldn't have been taken to their camps the organs of the machine
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:43.200]  would have ground to a halt in days I mean and when you realize the very same
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.560]  megabanks that funded Lenin and Stalin are funding this now they plan to do all
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:52.920]  of what they did in the Soviet Union here they lick their lips and talk about
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:57.840]  how they plan to exterminate at least 20% of this country they plan to take our
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:01.240]  kids and our wives and blow their heads off after they rape them these are
[01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:05.920]  murdering absolute people worse than the Bolsheviks and I don't say that for
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.480]  effect these are wanton bloodthirsty scum and they have our flag on their
[01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:17.440]  shoulders how do you deal with that well I think the important thing to always go
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.080]  back to is our Constitution and Bill of Rights I mean that's that's the truth
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:24.720]  that's the definition of independence and that's why they don't teach that in
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:28.760]  schools and so I encourage especially those in the military right now and
[01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:34.440]  also law enforcement go back and read the original documents read the causes for
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:39.200]  taking up arms in your forefathers revolution you will see it right then
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:42.920]  the question independence it's the same exact thing if nothing changes human
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:48.520]  nature does not change it's the same will to power it's the same a totalitarian
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.280]  mindset that they faced and they fought look at what they wrote in the Bill of
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:57.760]  Rights to stop this ever happening again look at what McCain and Lieberman and
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:01.360]  the rest of them want to do and they want you to be the tool of oppression over
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:05.720]  your own people see the truth and when you see the truth and you understand that
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.880]  your children your wives your family are all in danger also then you need to do
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.920]  what's right and what's right is as you must at least refuse stand down and
[01:17:15.920 --> 01:17:19.920]  refuse to be a tool of oppression but I'll tell you what if they start using
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:22.680]  military force against the United States and against the American people
[01:17:22.680 --> 01:17:26.240]  domestically you will have to make an even tougher choice you will have to
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:29.720]  fight on the side of the people you will have to make that choice just like
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:34.520]  George Washington did just like the militia in 1775 who was the military of
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:37.920]  the United States at the time they decided they made the choice they must
[01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:41.160]  fight back against the crown against the national government they had no choice
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.640]  you will have the same obligation now Ron Paul has talked about another
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:50.120]  possibility things may completely financially collapse before this happens
[01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:55.320]  and that might take the steam out of these people well you know it's
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.720]  interesting the very first conversation I have at Congress and Paul when I was
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.200]  going to apply for a job with him he was you know kind of worn down this is
[01:18:03.200 --> 01:18:07.320]  back in in 1998 and he said you know I'm afraid that it's going to get up
[01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.080]  economic collapse to wake the American people up and then I expressed the
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:14.840]  concern that well it could lead to more oppression like the Great Depression did
[01:18:14.840 --> 01:18:18.760]  and so there is that it's an open window like you said before it's a
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:23.920]  it's a two-way window of opportunity for very you know horrible evil things to
[01:18:23.920 --> 01:18:27.280]  happen and a destruction of our Constitution and destruction of freedom
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.160]  or it's an open window for us to resurrect it and restore the Republic so
[01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:35.240]  when this window opens and it will economic collapse is coming we need to
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.160]  be ready to make sure that we can push it through towards liberty we better be
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:42.800]  prepared for that but if we're for a week if we're not morally prepared
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:46.920]  spiritually prepared and physically prepared for it for what's coming then
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:51.000]  there's a chance that they could win describe Ron Paul back in 1998 but I've
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:54.120]  been interviewing him since 1996 but I don't know him obviously as well as you
[01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:57.640]  did working in his office for years now you describe worn down I mean this is a
[01:18:57.640 --> 01:19:02.440]  guy that does work 16 to 18 hours a day totally dedicated I mean describe for
[01:19:02.440 --> 01:19:06.160]  people out there what he's like behind the scenes okay folks we're gonna back
[01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:10.800]  that up about 20 seconds come back and play the last few minutes of this portion
[01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.160]  and in another part of the interview he describes how this is North com the
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:20.600]  Pentagon under globalist control openly saying and it's always been in the last
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:24.680]  10 years now there's been public North com is a military jurisdiction under
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:29.880]  military rule military law but this goes beyond Geneva Convention of military
[01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.120]  law they're saying we will arrest we will torture we will kill you've seen
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.040]  them torture and kill citizens it's always somebody like a locky well he
[01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:42.840]  deserves it but it sets that precedent and then you get the manuals and the
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:48.280]  training and you find out none of it's about al Qaeda 24 7 it's the people that
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:53.320]  don't like the bankers it's the real Americans who are informed like Ron Paul
[01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:58.160]  like myself like you you are the terrorist according to the mafia that's
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.800]  taken over because in reality they are the terrorist
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:07.440]  burglars love easy targets like a dark house that looks like no one is home
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.480]  don't let your home be the next target make it look like someone is home
[01:20:11.480 --> 01:20:16.200]  watching television with fake TV fake TV is a small electronic device that
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:19.440]  makes the same light as a real television so from outside it looks like

[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:12.320]  in Nazi Germany well Hitler was elected then he began dismantling their
[01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:17.960]  Weimar Republic model after ours to a great extent and the military and the
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:23.320]  police followed orders and they went to Dernburg and they trial and they said
[01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:29.320]  well we were told to do this and it was sorry you're gonna get hung following
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:38.840]  orders just doesn't cut it and a lot of people that serve this system whether
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.280]  you're bureaucrats robo signing stealing people's houses corporate bureaucrats
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:48.360]  whether you're government bureaucrats whether you're school teachers school
[01:24:48.360 --> 01:24:52.400]  nurses that go along with lying and telling parents that it's the law to
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:59.040]  take vaccines when you know it's not nurses that take blood from babies
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:03.200]  knowing it's going into a globalist database lying and saying it's a blood
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.720]  test I mean it's time to recognize just how many lies were under and how people
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:16.400]  that are part of the lie think it's cute to con somebody don't you know you're
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.680]  being lied to as well I mean do you want your children to grow up in an
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:22.560]  environment like this do you want to grow up in one like this you know people
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:25.240]  used to say don't let the new world order come in it'll be bad for your

[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:49.440]  every info war weapon we've got whether it's putting info wars up in public or
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:53.240]  whatever website you think is important or starting your own local radio show or
[01:25:53.240 --> 01:25:58.040]  access TV or calling in the talk radio going to your state legislature putting
[01:25:58.040 --> 01:26:03.240]  up banner hangs on highways getting the buzz for liberty going to spread our
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.280]  counter-revolution against the globalist revolutionaries who are trying to
[01:26:07.280 --> 01:26:12.200]  overthrow our republic they're the revolutionaries you don't understand
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:17.480]  that these are bona fide crux I mean look at all the examples now fast and
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:22.440]  furious the limit is the examples go on for ten hours
[01:26:24.360 --> 01:26:30.880]  this is designed to get worse they once the criminals start a tyrannical takeover
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:36.320]  like this they've got to extinct all free market all private wealth all systems
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:40.720]  of strength the family anything that could ever resist them they want to
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.040]  secure their crimes so they can carry out the really big crimes which are
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:51.400]  always a pull pot or Hitler type mass extermination why because they like it
[01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:55.840]  history is a hundred percent proof you've lived under the hedge of liberty
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:27:03.400]  I've lived under it so it's hard to believe it can happen here but it is it's
[01:27:03.400 --> 01:27:08.520]  like pulling up to your house and it's been out of town and it's burned down or
[01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.840]  your pipes burst and there's a hole in your roof or a tree fell on your house
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:16.480]  you pull up your house is burned down it happens it can happen here it is
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:25.600]  happening here and we're inundated with this propaganda about how the government
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:30.000]  loves us and cares about us and how the citizens can't be trusted it's classical
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.240]  tyranny let's go back to the end of this excerpt of the Stuart Rhodes 50 minute
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.400]  interview I did last night in full wars nightly nose here's the rest of it since
[01:27:39.400 --> 01:27:42.640]  1996 but I don't know I'm obviously as well as you did working in his office
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:47.120]  for years you describe worn down I mean this is a guy that does work 16 to 18
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.880]  hours a day totally dedicated I mean describe for people out there what he's
[01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:58.120]  like behind the scenes he's just saying behind the scenes is he's on camera he's
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.800]  that's him you know he's he's got endurance like I can't believe that he's
[01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:06.720]  I mean I'm burnout now I'm burnt out even after just two years of doing
[01:28:06.720 --> 01:28:10.800]  those keepers I'm fried I'm burnt out and I can't believe he's been going on
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:15.360]  doing like this for decades it's amazing so he just has the endurance of I
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:20.280]  think it's because it's it's calling he understands that this is his place in
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:25.480]  history and he I think he believes in his faith that in the end liberty will
[01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:29.040]  triumph otherwise I don't know how he could keep going on we had people on the
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:33.600]  staff there who quit and we're just so despondent what they saw back in 98 this
[01:28:33.600 --> 01:28:36.720]  is you know way before the war on terror and this other stuff but they were
[01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.800]  already so despondent about the you know the incredible tide of statism and
[01:28:40.800 --> 01:28:44.840]  government power that they were going up against in corruption yeah make me cross
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:48.320]  to her I gotta tell you I think about what this country's gonna go through it's
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:53.080]  gonna be horrible well we have that we have the potential we still have the
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:58.760]  potential for it to be like 1989 in eastern Germany when the wall fell if
[01:28:58.760 --> 01:29:03.040]  there's enough of an awakening in the people you can reach that tipping point
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:06.400]  well that's what finally happened there was the military refused to shoot the
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:10.560]  people trying to get out that's right and they all stood down all at once and
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:14.680]  without their support the Communist Party was done the Stasi were powerless
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:18.480]  they all ran and and hid and tore off their their emblems and tried to hide
[01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.680]  in the crowd there's a famous photo when my mom was over in Germany a few years
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:25.960]  ago she brought me back and it was a famous photo of a family running through
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:31.800]  barbed wire and well the little kid is caught on it and there's a series of them
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.800]  and he takes a little kid and gives it to the parents and of course they took
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.400]  that guy and tortured him and killed him but that's a famous photo of the East
[01:29:38.400 --> 01:29:41.800]  German soldier the people have gotten across and he goes ahead and gives them
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:45.600]  the toddler which seems like just a normal human act but that was his death
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.040]  sentence he should have just gone ahead and climbed on through and gone with him
[01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:58.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:06.080]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.480]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:14.160]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home

[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:24.720]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.880]  pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.080]  criminal offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:32.520]  Johnson has been referred to as the most fiscally conservative governor in the
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:37.600]  country and he was the governor of New Mexico from 94 to 2003 was successful
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:43.600]  businessman before that and of course he's now running for president just like
[01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:49.000]  kind of like Ron Paul did four years ago building up to to at least inject real
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.640]  ideas and issues he's been a part of many of the debates he's been given in a
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:56.840]  tiny amounts of time just like Ron Paul as the system basically kind of games
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:36:01.880]  things like a mafia run horse race where they let the in a five five you know
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:06.280]  five lap race they give the other horses a four lap head start and tie bowling
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:11.000]  bowls on to Ron Paul and Gary Johnson Gary Johnson 2012 comms the website and
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.640]  our America initiative comm governor great to have you here with us today sir
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:22.200]  Alex great to be with you and you know talking about the debate being excluded
[01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:28.360]  from 14 of the 16 debates really kind of has a self-fulfilling prophecy unto
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:35.920]  itself and the issue is is that I'm not even in the poll that determines whether
[01:36:35.920 --> 01:36:42.520]  or not you get into the debate so they identify ABC poll you're having to show
[01:36:42.520 --> 01:36:49.720]  2% in ABC poll and I'm not in ABC poll and when I'm in the poll I show as well
[01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:57.800]  as others that are on stage so you hit it on the head it's not fair and I
[01:36:57.800 --> 01:37:02.880]  really kind of feel put out by the Republican Party that the Republican
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:08.240]  Party didn't stand up to this notion of just to put Johnson in the polls we're
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:12.240]  not asking that he'd be in the debate but just put in the polls that give him
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.120]  an opportunity to potentially yeah they're not even letting you try to
[01:37:16.120 --> 01:37:20.920]  qualify in their rig system but take Ron Paul he's number one number two or
[01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:26.480]  number three even CBS admits in all these caucuses and and events that are
[01:37:26.480 --> 01:37:30.960]  coming up and in all these different polls sometimes they give him 89 seconds
[01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:34.360]  when the next candidate gets three minutes and people like Romney 11
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:40.920]  minutes I mean if that isn't bold in your face cheating and and rigging I
[01:37:40.920 --> 01:37:45.560]  don't know what is I mean that whoever they're ignoring that's an endorsement
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.400]  right there they're scared of you they're scared of Ron Paul and to a
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:51.600]  certain extent they don't like Michelle Bachman either you know that CBS memo
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.720]  came out and and and they're really trying to shut you guys down well no I
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.720]  think you I think you hit it on the head and at its base is the notion that
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:06.680]  it's unfair and at the base of the message that really isn't getting heard
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:12.240]  and not that a lot of people don't don't want it expressed and that is look
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:16.960]  let's cut the spending let's balance the budget and then you know the whole
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:21.400]  thing would occupy Wall Street the notion that this country deals it out
[01:38:21.400 --> 01:38:29.120]  unfairly this country deals it out unfairly it's pale it it's money to
[01:38:29.120 --> 01:38:34.920]  politicians that grant special loopholes to groups individual corporations that
[01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:39.400]  are well connected politically as opposed to the notion of a level playing
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:44.920]  field that all of us have equal access to the American dream so and in that
[01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:50.680]  context Alex I'm advocating the fair tax for those listening if you haven't
[01:38:50.680 --> 01:38:56.560]  checked out the fair tax truly check it out it is as the name implies it's fair
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.440]  the more money you make the more fair tax you'll pay it'll promote savings it'll
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.840]  do away with all existing federal governor yours isn't like Herman Cain
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:10.240]  where he keeps the income tax but just at 9% can later jack it up and also
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:16.520]  keeps the payroll tax is it no I would ask everybody everybody listening right
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:21.680]  now to get online check it out their tax dot org it does away with all existing
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:27.320]  federal tax so corporate tax business tax income tax does away with the IRS
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:33.480]  does away with withholding because it does away with the corporate income tax
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:40.120]  if the private sector does not create tens of millions of jobs in an
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:45.800]  environment of zero corporate taxes I don't know what environment could exist
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:51.000]  to where that would happen by the private sector and then there's the whole
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:57.200]  notion of goods and services to China into all goods and services right now
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:03.520]  is about a 23% tax so by enacting the fair tax you actually believe that out
[01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:10.200]  so that American goods and services become 23% more competitive when we're
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:15.520]  exporting those goods and services as would imported goods and services be
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:25.000]  subject to the 23% fair tax fair tax well again I like you because you're for
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:33.600]  drug decriminalization which is is is is is a really important obviously because
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.280]  it hasn't worked and there's more drugs and it's destroyed our society and we
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:43.120]  have the highest prison population in the world not just per capita but period
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:46.080]  and have you seen all these articles coming out where they admit our trips
[01:40:46.080 --> 01:40:52.960]  are helping grow the opium in Afghanistan look I just think right now if
[01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:58.760]  we can't connect the dots between border violence with Mexico and prohibition I
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.760]  don't know if we ever will these are disputes that are being played out with
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:07.160]  guns rather than the court and if you want to look to the if you want to look to
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.200]  the debate right now everybody on stage wants to build a fence with the
[01:41:11.200 --> 01:41:15.240]  exception of Perry and don't build a fence I think that that would be a
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.920]  terrible waste of resource make it as easy as possible for somebody who wants
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:25.200]  to come into this country to get a work visa to get a work visa not a green
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:31.160]  card not citizenship but and by the way taxes won't even be an issue if we
[01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:36.120]  implement the fair tax because their tax is unavoidable whether your illegal
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:42.640]  legal visitor their tax is unavoidable and then you know looking at border
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:48.760]  violence with the exception of Ron Paul every other candidate on state wants to
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:54.480]  answer the guns on the border the gun violence on the border with more guns
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:42:00.240]  great what would you do as as president with with something like fast and furious
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:03.920]  because we always see the next administration protect the last
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:09.440]  administration on and on and on what's your view of fast and furious governor
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.440]  Gary Johnson joining us right now Republican presidential candidate and
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:16.680]  after you tell us your view on fast and furious which is you know in your neck
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:20.160]  of the woods it's affected in Mexico as you know as well as Arizona it's very
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.640]  close to the epicenter even more so than Texas in fact there was some fast and
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:28.240]  furious in New Mexico as you know where you were governor and then I want to get
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:34.920]  your view on the core designs 40 to one bet being Obama's advisor now more bailouts
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:43.200]  to Europe and their central banks and and what you think of MF global well you
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:49.360]  know the financial crisis right now in in Europe is one of liquidity and that
[01:42:49.360 --> 01:42:57.640]  that liquidity crisis comes about as a result of potential potentially no
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:02.520]  payment on bond from that's the reason of course for the last several weeks and
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:09.320]  fell off when it comes to u.s. equities is raising raising cash you know short term
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:15.360]  if if Europe goes down the tank short term gold will go down tremendously
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.320]  there'll be a tremendous spike down for gold simply because the bank have
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:22.960]  liquidity so you're pointing out the fact that you know we're making the
[01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:29.920]  bank liquid it doesn't address the underlying issue which is the values
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:35.680]  of these of these assets have not been written down and so I'm afraid that this
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.760]  is it's going to be something very recurring we in this country should be
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:46.720]  pursuing strong monetary policy not weak monetary policy returning to the gold
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:52.400]  standard that would be a real plus what is your long-term view on gold because
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.480]  worldwide governments are signaling turning printing presses up won't that
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:44:00.840]  drive gold and silver up but also other commodities in the long term absolutely
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:07.400]  yes absolutely but short term you could you could see an absolute which is kind
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.800]  of what we've seen that the downward spikes have to do with with liquidity
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:18.680]  and banks and their ability to sell off the liquid stuff and so hence equities
[01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:23.840]  and commodities over the last several weeks now first you know we've got
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:27.320]  everything seems to be rallying at the moment and it's rallying on the on the
[01:44:27.320 --> 01:44:31.880]  basis of liquidity and yes we're pumping more liquidity into a system
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:42.200]  global global economically that we're gonna have inflation everywhere now what
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.760]  is your take those specifically on fast and furious oh what an outrage I mean
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:52.160]  there's a total outrage government to run amok this is when you this is when
[01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:58.800]  you have a holder running justice and obviously maybe what it is obvious that
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.840]  he's not running justice at all somebody else is but this is what government can
[01:45:02.840 --> 01:45:08.600]  do and it's government at its worst and there ought to be some and there are
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:14.280]  whether has to be accountability for or potentially guns being used against
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:20.520]  ourselves I don't I don't even get the point I don't get it at all I it doesn't
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:27.840]  make any sense from a disease far as I'm concerned let me expand on what's
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.560]  what's currently happening and what you as a governor as a presidential candidate
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:36.360]  what your views are on this we've seen the National Defense Authorization Act
[01:45:36.360 --> 01:45:41.480]  and the big debates and they the sponsors Graham and Mackay now admit
[01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:46.160]  yeah will arrest citizens forever throw you into a dungeon and no one will know
[01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:49.680]  where you went and now we got another bill to go ahead and say okay it is
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.560]  torture we're gonna legalize torture I mean they can't legalize barbecuing
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:58.000]  black children on the White House lawn you can't legalize raping a woman in an
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:46:04.240]  alley even even of Nero or Hitler says so and we see the Republicans involved
[01:46:04.240 --> 01:46:08.160]  in this we see newt genrich promoting it we see newt genrich who supported
[01:46:08.160 --> 01:46:13.760]  government health care and all this what is your view of the just the open
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:17.520]  authoritarianism being pushed I'm sure you heard Homeland Security's putting
[01:46:17.520 --> 01:46:22.640]  lamp post-op everywhere with microphones in them TSA on the streets of America
[01:46:22.640 --> 01:46:28.240]  what's your view on how fast all this is moving well it's moving really fast and
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:34.560]  all to our detriment is it making a finish paper it's absolutely not making a
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:40.680]  finish paper and and getting worse not better you know I'm making three
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.760]  promises to running for president of the United States one is I promise to
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:49.640]  submit a balanced budget to Congress in the year 2013 now Alex that's
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.760]  promising to submit a balanced budget I can't promise a balanced budget but I'm
[01:46:53.760 --> 01:46:59.040]  promising to submit it so that's a 43% reduction in government spending and
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:03.840]  included in that would be ideally would be limited eliminating the Department of
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:07.440]  Homeland Security the fact that it's so redundant I just happen to think there's
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:13.160]  a 43% redundancy or redundancy or overage built into every single department
[01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:17.680]  in in federal government past and here is an example of that I mean what what
[01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:22.640]  is this this is the too much time on people's hands to think up but
[01:47:22.640 --> 01:47:28.520]  absolutely not even possibly think of I mean were they is this is an afternoon
[01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:34.520]  thing session where they were they drink manhattan's I'm not sure but it makes no
[01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:41.600]  sense whatsoever and and so balance the federal budget cut 43% of government and
[01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.160]  that starts with Medicaid that starts with Medicare that starts with military
[01:47:46.160 --> 01:47:52.920]  spending this the big three Gary you're running for president trying to
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:48:00.760]  interject your your your brand of libertarian ideas and obviously they're
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.160]  shutting you out because they are scared I mean if you were given equal time and
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:07.880]  brought these ideas they're very popular with Republicans and a lot of
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:12.360]  libertarians and even liberals that are halfway away I mean that's why you've
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:18.000]  got you won by such big margins there in New Mexico and then left like you said
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:22.640]  you would leave after a time I mean I mean clearly they're not letting you have
[01:48:22.640 --> 01:48:25.640]  equal time or anything close to it and keeping you out of the majority of the
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:29.440]  debates as you said because they are scared of those ideas so I think in a
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:33.760]  way that's a compliment because because they understand that that freedom is
[01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:39.800]  popular but but going down this course it the authoritarians it looks like
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:45.680]  will at least be able to get us a few more you know football fields down the
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:50.000]  road into tyranny where do you see America in a year or two if this course
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:55.320]  has not changed that we're on right now I really believe that we're going to
[01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:59.040]  experience the monetary collapse I just don't think that it's so avoidable you
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:03.720]  can't continue to spend more money than what you take in and so that's the
[01:49:03.720 --> 01:49:08.240]  negative side the really positive side of this is that we can pick that we can
[01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:14.360]  live within our means and I really think the Faircats serves as a foundation
[01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:18.320]  for all of that by the way it's revenue neutral so you still have to cut 43%
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:24.360]  from government spending but this is something that we can get under control
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:31.680]  I'm also promising as the United States veto any legislation where expenses
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:35.160]  exceed revenue okay so I'm going to submit a balanced budget to Congress
[01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:37.640]  they're going to they're going to have nothing to do with it they're
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:41.640]  going to submit me spending that exceeds revenue I'm going to veto it they're
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:46.200]  going to have to override I just suggest to you that in the scenario that I
[01:49:46.200 --> 01:49:51.120]  just pointed out promising to do those two things spending will be less than
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:57.280]  any other scenario that that could possibly be presented but again they
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:50:01.280]  won't even let you in what did you say of 16 debates you've been excluded from
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:06.280]  14 that's correct and that has a self-fulfilling prophecy you know when
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:11.920]  you're when you're out on the stump if you will well the stump is different if
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.160]  you're not even a candidate and by not even a candidate I'm afraid that if
[01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:21.400]  you're not on stage for most people that qualifies you as not being a candidate
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:26.760]  and when you're given a when you're given a survey whether that's online or
[01:50:26.760 --> 01:50:32.080]  mailed to you over the telephone and your names not on that survey that even
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:41.560]  makes it more difficult to qualify I qualified for the CNBC debate three
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:47.800]  weeks ago they had two criteria one was three percent in any national poll the
[01:50:47.800 --> 01:50:52.000]  other was be a registered candidate for president while I was at three percent in
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:56.800]  a CNN poll sure a new Ganners was it three percent a month ago now he's the
[01:50:56.800 --> 01:51:01.480]  front runner and I mean stay there we'll be right back final second going gets

[01:54:10.960 --> 01:54:19.080]  candidate Gary Johnson on with us Obama lawyer citizens targeted if it war with
[01:54:19.080 --> 01:54:24.120]  the US and of all people Diane Feinstein is trying to offer an amendment
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:29.320]  saying you can't arrest citizens in the US but you can't have troops on the
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:36.240]  streets now and the Obama lawyers have come out and said no if US citizens are
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:42.560]  at war with the US military they can they can kill you anywhere well under
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:48.960]  common law anybody attacks military citizen whatever you've got a right to
[01:54:48.960 --> 01:54:53.200]  defend yourself I mean they keep saying let our military fight Al Qaeda that's
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:55:00.840]  American that they've been killing them it just eat the they lie to the public
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:04.480]  about all of this they're talking about getting rid of positive commentators
[01:55:04.480 --> 01:55:07.920]  using full military on the streets which the Pentagon was given orders years
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:12.480]  ago to get ready for Army times you name it and now they're just out in the
[01:55:12.480 --> 01:55:16.840]  open Gary Johnson what do you make of all of this because the president's
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:20.280]  saying I don't need Congress to pass a law to give me this authority so I'm
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:24.920]  gonna veto it he's not saying he's gonna veto this this this declaration of war
[01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:28.800]  against the American people because he doesn't like it he says he already has
[01:55:28.800 --> 01:55:34.920]  that power Gary what would you do as president with this type of garbage well
[01:55:34.920 --> 01:55:41.880]  it's also I mean this is a breaking news of the moment but if we go back oh I
[01:55:41.880 --> 01:55:45.960]  don't know two months ago when the holder issued a letter saying he was
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:50.920]  gonna crack down on medical marijuana facilities in California when Obama had
[01:55:50.920 --> 01:55:54.880]  earlier said that the last thing he was gonna use federal resources for was to
[01:55:54.880 --> 01:56:00.560]  come in and counteract something that state citizens had voted on whether it
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:04.660]  was their legislature or whether it was them as citizens and in this case we're
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:10.440]  talking about medical marijuana in California so it's as we as you alluded
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:16.120]  to earlier talking with you here if it's just one thing after another and it's
[01:56:16.120 --> 01:56:22.200]  all about more government not less government and we're broke I think the
[01:56:22.200 --> 01:56:26.520]  biggest threat to our national security is the fact that that we're borrowing or
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:30.320]  printing money to the tune of 43 cents out of every dollar that we're currently
[01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:34.440]  spending you're right governor but in closing look at Europe you know the I'm
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.000]  sure you're a financial guy read the news it says Goldman Sachs dictatorship you
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:44.480]  know all power in European nations transferred to banking system so in a
[01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:48.400]  way these guys want to be the last people standing they like it that we're
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:53.320]  going bankrupt they want to wreck things I mean I that's the only thing you can
[01:56:53.320 --> 01:56:57.520]  come away with because the very culprits then poses the saviors the
[01:56:57.520 --> 01:57:02.520]  crony capitalist who are the opposite of free yeah the root of the root of all
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:06.520]  evil is the fact that it is crony capitalism it's not free market it's
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:12.560]  crony capitalism the systems up for sale and people pay for it and politicians
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:20.400]  politicians pass the special favors if you will and rather than the notion
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:23.440]  that this country is free and that we can all partake equally in the
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:28.600]  opportunities that it presents it's not if this is the fact that and then the
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:32.920]  very crony capitalist their MSNBC and CNN demonized the free market and say
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:35.960]  well what we need is more socialism because they know they can go in and
[01:57:35.960 --> 01:57:39.480]  lobby and get that socialist money they take from you and I we've got to get
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:43.520]  that message out and governor I just want to thank you for running because you
[01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.520]  are injecting real issues and a perspective that the establishment
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:50.640]  doesn't like and that's why they're trying to preclude you but you are
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:54.600]  getting the message out to a lot of people and so I appreciate you running
[01:57:54.600 --> 01:57:58.600]  for president so that at least if you didn't run we wouldn't know they were
[01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.360]  rigging debates I mean you've got to probe this corruption to be able to
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:09.400]  expose it well and a big you know thank you Alex you keep you keep talking
[01:58:09.400 --> 01:58:16.400]  about it not less people and thank you for all you do thank you governor we
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:19.200]  know things are gonna get better if we don't engage these people resistance is

[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:43.960]  half the kids in America on drugs over two-thirds of foster children are put
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:48.400]  on psychotropic we're gonna break this down it ties in with the radiation from
[02:00:48.400 --> 02:00:52.240]  Wi-Fi connections can reduce sperm activity I mentioned this yesterday but
[02:00:52.240 --> 02:00:56.920]  I want to tie it in with all of this and more we got Max Kaiser coming on in 30
[02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:04.280]  minutes but here's the deal here's the deal I'm gonna get into this drugging of

[02:01:22.880 --> 02:01:25.760]  want to take your calls on any of the issues we've mentioned or anything you
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:29.160]  want to bring up let's take a bunch of them right now Angie in North Carolina
[02:01:29.160 --> 02:01:35.400]  you're on the year go ahead hi Alex I'm really glad that you're giving so much
[02:01:35.400 --> 02:01:41.560]  exposure to this horrific National Defense Authorization Act but there's an
[02:01:41.560 --> 02:01:44.520]  aspect of it that I don't think people are really thinking about and you're
[02:01:44.520 --> 02:01:49.440]  right when you say that they've already basically had the ability to do this to
[02:01:49.440 --> 02:01:55.040]  citizens since the Bush administration Military Military Commissions Act and
[02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:59.240]  the Patriot Act I don't think people realize though that this is more or less
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:04.520]  designed it's targeted towards doing away with state sovereignty because the
[02:02:04.520 --> 02:02:09.400]  military is a federal entity so I think this is geared more towards you know the
[02:02:09.400 --> 02:02:14.480]  sheriff's that are beginning to rise up and and realize that there's so much
[02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:19.520]  federal intrusion going on or even local representatives that won't go along with
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:23.680]  no you're right if that we do report on the John Warner Defense Authorization
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:29.120]  Act of 07 it talks about the states and governors that are in insurrection and
[02:02:29.120 --> 02:02:33.560]  the citizens no this is the corporate global takeover just like in Europe
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:39.080]  they're saying the EU megabanks will now run your country your your government
[02:02:39.080 --> 02:02:43.480]  has no sovereignty you can never leave this of course you can leave it they're
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:50.320]  just telling you your slaves now thank God we're here to to rob you exactly
[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:55.520]  exactly and I think that I really don't know what to do at this point I'm
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:58.920]  concerned about you know our future I'm concerned about the future of my
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:04.400]  children I you know how do you fight this cut this big of a beast well I just
[02:03:04.400 --> 02:03:07.760]  wish I hear you I wish the average police and they've all been put their
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:11.360]  anti-terror training could ask themselves why were you being told all
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.160]  these years domestic terrorist you know anti-new world order people were going
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:19.680]  to be attacking you did you ever wonder what you're gonna be ordered to do that
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:24.560]  will make people be forced to fight you I mean it's so clear they've been
[02:03:24.560 --> 02:03:28.900]  indoctrinated by an evil force that's taken over the country I mean it's
[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:36.600]  so incredibly transparent what's going on here so if this ends up you know the
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:42.960]  worst-case scenario if it goes through and effectively neuters state sovereignty
[02:03:42.960 --> 02:03:49.760]  then you know what's the recourse of sheriffs or state representatives that
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:55.880]  don't want military marching into their state to you know round up protesters or
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:02.840]  what have you what what would the state be able to do then well it is it is
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:08.600]  classical no way to deny what it is I mean it's like a yellow dog comes walking
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.840]  down your street it's a yellow dog you walk by a lake and there's a duck
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.040]  quacking swimming around it's a duck you're out in Montana and a wolf runs up
[02:04:16.040 --> 02:04:21.960]  it's a wolf you see a 57 red Chevy drive-by it's a 57 red Chevy I mean this

[02:08:02.480 --> 02:08:08.080]  network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your
[02:08:08.080 --> 02:08:10.560]  mind
[02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:16.640]  there are a lot of people out there that know that the government and major
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:26.480]  corporations are corrupt on average and completely out of control but they don't
[02:08:26.480 --> 02:08:31.720]  see themselves as leaders they don't see themselves as ever challenging and
[02:08:31.720 --> 02:08:38.160]  that's because the Hollywood archetype has been projected into the public
[02:08:38.160 --> 02:08:45.560]  consciousness that Conan the barbarian or Sylvester Stallone or whoever the
[02:08:45.560 --> 02:08:50.880]  hero is has to go out and defeat the enemy single-handed that's not how the
[02:08:50.880 --> 02:08:57.920]  world works you can have a martyr or a banner or an idea that does empower
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:05.000]  people and you can have individuals that do focus and do incredible
[02:09:05.000 --> 02:09:11.480]  things who then become a larger focus for others but any real resistance to
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:19.400]  tyranny and any true great work is done by many people working together and you
[02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:22.120]  don't have to wait for orders from headquarters in fact there is no
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:27.760]  headquarters it's an idea of freedom it's a spirit of liberty the spirit of
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:38.400]  1776 versus the mindset of 1984 and we're here and I keep saying we're at the
[02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:45.240]  crossroads we're always at a crossroads but this is a critical juncture when we
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:51.040]  could still slow down their program and then later turn it back but soon we will
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:58.080]  go down into even deeper areas and it more people will then wake up still
[02:09:58.080 --> 02:10:03.320]  others will get scared and actually join with evil a lot of folks see
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:10.320]  corruption coming they go and grovel to it we don't need them that always
[02:10:10.320 --> 02:10:15.800]  happens we need people who are good and decent and honorable who have been in
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:20.320]  denial or been too busy to focus to really discover history discover our
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:25.080]  current circumstances and take action Max Kaiser is coming up on the
[02:10:25.080 --> 02:10:29.120]  accelerating implosion by design of the Euro like him to join us at least once
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:32.200]  a week to give us an update I want to go to your phone calls though right now
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:36.360]  very quickly we just had governor former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson on
[02:10:36.360 --> 02:10:40.800]  from New Mexico here's another Gary from New Mexico Gary and New Mexico you're
[02:10:40.800 --> 02:10:46.540]  on the air hey Alex present planet subscriber money bomb donor disabled
[02:10:46.540 --> 02:10:52.920]  veteran just to be very quick our recent family Thanksgiving was over four or
[02:10:52.920 --> 02:10:58.280]  over 30 people of about backgrounds to include ex-military like myself cops and
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:03.640]  what we did was we watched the entire rise of female police speak for and once
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:08.240]  that we finished that we watched the Jesse Ventura from from Steve Cohen on
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:13.840]  HR 645 on YouTube and then I also provided everybody with a copy of the
[02:11:13.840 --> 02:11:21.480]  rise of FEMA the bill HR 645 and a pocket Constitution if they had any
[02:11:21.480 --> 02:11:30.880]  questions and they certainly could ask me everybody sat there shocked shocked is
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:37.800]  to the corruption and the fusion centers that's in every city and or in every
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:43.360]  state in the United States the policemen in our family were shocked even more so
[02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:47.320]  than anybody you know why police get so shocked watching my films and reports
[02:11:47.320 --> 02:11:51.360]  because they know it's all true because they've got pieces of it but we're
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:55.840]  compartmentalized when we give them a film like that it's a briefing they know
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:59.080]  all the pieces are true and they get chills because I've talked to them and
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:03.520]  they go whoa now it makes perfect sense it didn't make sense before because
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:09.560]  they're given a systems analysis from the top level see we've just re-engineered
[02:12:09.560 --> 02:12:13.560]  and reverse engineered what they're really up to and so we're basically here
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:18.720]  this breaks it all down exactly and I gave everybody a copy I gave the
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:24.160]  placement in the family extra copies to take to their their cronies you know
[02:12:24.160 --> 02:12:30.000]  here in town or wherever they came from and it was just a meaning to see the
[02:12:30.000 --> 02:12:34.240]  their facial expressions and the unbelievable it was just off of the
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:38.280]  feet and I just wanted to what parts of what parts of rise of FEMA would
[02:12:38.280 --> 02:12:42.120]  particularly welcome up let me guess the part where the military admits they're
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:49.320]  training to confiscate guns in Iowa yes yes that and and all the executive
[02:12:49.320 --> 02:12:55.560]  orders that they issued what's happening on the house floor that gave with the
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:13:00.400]  with the S 1867 that they gave the military to end posse commentators
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:05.240]  they give the right to the military a coming in arrest US citizens veterans
[02:13:05.240 --> 02:13:12.800]  are not for no purpose for no undefined attention see your family sounds like
[02:13:12.800 --> 02:13:17.360]  they're normal smart Americans who I would imagine actually saw a lot of
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:21.640]  stuff and so we're real people and and that's why in a way it's easy to wake
[02:13:21.640 --> 02:13:25.360]  up police and military because they may be brainwashed to a certain extent but
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:28.200]  they've actually been in the real world who I'm really worried about is just
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:32.120]  these and I'm not saying I'm hard and tough myself I'm pretty soft but I see
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:38.280]  these yuppies they are just helpless they have no idea they are so soft they
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.760]  are so ignorant and they hear this stuff and they just giggle they laugh it's
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:49.280]  funny and they have no idea what the rest of the world's like they have no
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:53.720]  idea how hard it is to keep liberty as Thomas Jefferson said but that is such
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:57.960]  a great call God bless you great here in Framiguerie wow that's what makes it all
[02:13:57.960 --> 02:14:02.200]  worth it when I leave so many times and get home at 10 o'clock at night and my
[02:14:02.200 --> 02:14:07.760]  children beg me to be home more and I've tried to be home more some miss them so
[02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:14.880]  much miss my children so much but every time I look at them they're so peaceful
[02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:18.520]  and innocent they deserve that I put out my full full energy against these
[02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:24.160]  globalists and not mince words with you now again we've got to stop thinking it's
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:28.240]  impolite to tell the truth and freak people out I saw some old family
[02:14:28.240 --> 02:14:32.440]  friends the other night I was picking up some food at a restaurant about nine
[02:14:32.440 --> 02:14:40.680]  o'clock at night and I saw some family friends and family friends they were
[02:14:40.680 --> 02:14:43.920]  actually family friends of my wife's family but I've met him at events and
[02:14:43.920 --> 02:14:47.320]  thanks four or five times over the years but their house for dinner one of the
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:50.880]  guys pretty famous actually he was involved in the whole Mujahideen thing
[02:14:50.880 --> 02:15:01.600]  against the against the against the Soviets and all that and was it Charlie
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:05.560]  Wilson's war whatever it is but side issue and I don't see him if you know
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:08.440]  like ten years ago they'd be like oh that's pretty wild stuff you talk about
[02:15:08.440 --> 02:15:13.520]  I saw about four years ago and and they were like yeah I'm starting to
[02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:15.840]  believe what you're saying is right this time it's like oh we're big fans you're
[02:15:15.840 --> 02:15:19.440]  right it's all true oh my god you know about this and that and you know talking
[02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:24.720]  about the plan to arrest citizens and all this people are finally waking up
[02:15:24.720 --> 02:15:29.400]  people are finally waking up people in government are waking up people ask how
[02:15:29.400 --> 02:15:33.080]  am I still alive it's because there are a lot of people in government I mean look
[02:15:33.080 --> 02:15:36.480]  at Bloomberg had an article about why is Ron Paul getting the majority of
[02:15:36.480 --> 02:15:41.000]  donations from federal employees and the headline was give this man money so he
[02:15:41.000 --> 02:15:45.520]  can fire you they know there's no America in the end if government isn't cut
[02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:49.360]  there's nothing it's all gonna go it's all gonna go bankrupt if it isn't
[02:15:49.360 --> 02:15:58.160]  write it it's like a high-rise building with a fire on ten stories and
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:01.400]  everything's get destroyed and if you turn the sprinkler system on it's gonna
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:06.120]  flood the whole building but but but you're gonna lose more stuff if you
[02:16:06.120 --> 02:16:11.920]  don't turn the sprinkler system on it's like don't turn the sprinklers on that
[02:16:11.920 --> 02:16:16.520]  might damage some of the upholstery it's going to burn out if you don't turn
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:23.160]  them on you see the globalist plan is to implode societies Pat in New York or
[02:16:23.160 --> 02:16:29.560]  on the air go ahead yeah like how you doing pretty good sir um you know I just
[02:16:29.560 --> 02:16:33.920]  wanted to say man I really really do not like John McCain at all right now
[02:16:33.920 --> 02:16:40.600]  because not only did he dress this NDAA behind our backs you know he also
[02:16:40.600 --> 02:16:45.320]  insulted where I live I don't know if you heard that yeah he said that Long
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:49.080]  Island is regrettably a part of the United States I don't know if you heard
[02:16:49.080 --> 02:16:53.880]  that I did hear other people talk about it what was he saying that in now what
[02:16:53.880 --> 02:16:58.240]  context I'm not exactly sure I just so sniffed it's
[02:16:58.240 --> 02:17:02.080]  out here in the local news but yeah I think he was talking to Chuck Schumer and
[02:17:02.080 --> 02:17:06.560]  he said that Long Island is regrettably a part of the United States and he did
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:11.000]  like a little snickering you know and they really you know it got everybody
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:14.840]  right here infuriated yeah well regrettably John McCain is part of the
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:21.080]  United States yeah exactly brother exactly but you know it's just another
[02:17:21.080 --> 02:17:26.800]  one point I wanted to make you know it's it's just so insane like that there's
[02:17:26.800 --> 02:17:31.280]  people in in the original colonies of the United States that you know are
[02:17:31.280 --> 02:17:34.280]  calling for free everything for everybody you know this is where the
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:38.840]  American Revolutionary War was fought you know British government was doing
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:45.400]  the exact same thing the money scams the checkpoints all of it and and it wasn't
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:49.720]  like the colonists wanted war they came to take your guns they came to take
[02:17:49.720 --> 02:17:52.720]  their property they were killing colonists and finally people said well
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.720]  if you're gonna try to kill me anyways how about you die yeah I mean it gets to
[02:17:56.720 --> 02:18:01.040]  that point it's like that it's like the I shot the Sheriff's song Sheriff John
[02:18:01.040 --> 02:18:05.440]  Brown's coming down the road pulled his gun to shoot me so I shot him I mean

[02:26:16.760 --> 02:26:19.880]  the Democrats will fix it the Republicans will fix it and the whole
[02:26:19.880 --> 02:26:26.640]  leadership is the exact same group and people listen listen very carefully

[02:37:07.480 --> 02:37:14.560]  nukes on a massing Chinese drills as everything collapses and it's just
[02:37:14.560 --> 02:37:19.120]  getting crazier by the minute Max Kaiser inventor of the virtual trading Hollywood
[02:37:19.120 --> 02:37:24.360]  stock exchange system successful broker in his own right author TV host radio
[02:37:24.360 --> 02:37:29.240]  host you name it max always good to have you join us and as we talked to you
[02:37:29.240 --> 02:37:35.240]  early last week a lot has transpired on MF global Europe all of it where is it
[02:37:35.240 --> 02:37:39.400]  all going I mean I guess they're just testing the perch as a parrot does and
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:43.760]  then the globalists are saying wow the people are letting us gang rape them then
[02:37:43.760 --> 02:37:49.600]  all steam ahead all's well I mean is that what's happening here
[02:37:49.600 --> 02:37:55.760]  hey it's great to be back on well a few days ago what happened is a big
[02:37:55.760 --> 02:38:00.240]  French bank by the name of credit agriculture was about to go bankrupt and
[02:38:00.240 --> 02:38:05.160]  that's what triggered this massive move by the Federal Reserve Bank in New York
[02:38:05.160 --> 02:38:09.560]  to stage a global bailout now the last time I was on your show or a couple
[02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:14.200]  months ago we knew that a French bank was gonna go bankrupt I speculated that
[02:38:14.200 --> 02:38:21.080]  it would be out there society general or BP credit agriculture was the third name
[02:38:21.080 --> 02:38:24.600]  on the list it turns out that credit agriculture which is the the biggest bank
[02:38:24.600 --> 02:38:29.600]  by in terms of number of branches and number of customers it's the biggest
[02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:35.200]  bank throughout France was on debts doorstep so the Federal Reserve Bank of
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:38.920]  New York because to bail out Goldman Sachs who has investments in all these
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:43.000]  foreign banks they stepped up and then gauge and what are called foreign
[02:38:43.000 --> 02:38:47.720]  currency liquidity swaps and I can get into that a little bit because that's a
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:53.080]  massive fraud if you want me to explain that sure and then we'll get into what
[02:38:53.080 --> 02:38:59.040]  mega US banks you think you're gonna go belly up soon go ahead well this foreign
[02:38:59.040 --> 02:39:06.320]  currency liquidity swaps allows US banks to use bonds on foreign territories and
[02:39:06.320 --> 02:39:11.080]  foreign banks balance sheets as collateral to leverage them up by 10 or
[02:39:11.080 --> 02:39:16.880]  20 to 1 to bypass all the laws in Europe and bypass the laws of the European
[02:39:16.880 --> 02:39:20.800]  Central Bank etc because the European Central Bank is a very afraid of
[02:39:20.800 --> 02:39:25.240]  inflation you know because the European Central Bank is the really the Bundesbank
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:28.600]  it's really the German Central Bank and ever since the hyperinflation of the
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:32.640]  Weimar in the 1920s they've been paranoid about hyperinflation and they're
[02:39:32.640 --> 02:39:36.960]  very sensitive about this inflation idea so what the New York Fed did was they
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:41.440]  just bypassed European Central Bank and said we're going to leverage up your
[02:39:41.440 --> 02:39:46.200]  balance sheets 10 to 1 overnight as a way to quote unquote increase liquidity
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:51.360]  and as a way for our banks in New York like Goldman Sachs to claim sovereignty
[02:39:51.360 --> 02:39:55.840]  to an even greater extent over your European countries so this is what they
[02:39:55.840 --> 02:40:01.960]  call foreign currency liquidity swaps it's the latest in the big game to allow
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:07.720]  a few global bankers to run the show the next big big move here you're going to
[02:40:07.720 --> 02:40:11.160]  hear a lot more about it will be the introduction of the special drawing
[02:40:11.160 --> 02:40:14.640]  rights or the continuation of the special drawing rights though a special
[02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:20.280]  drawing right is a fiat currency like a US dollar or a euro except it's being
[02:40:20.280 --> 02:40:24.880]  printed by the IMF so the IMF can print money it's called a special drawing
[02:40:24.880 --> 02:40:29.000]  right and by the way the US Postal Service on foreign package deliveries for
[02:40:29.000 --> 02:40:35.840]  at least a year is already quantitating it out and listing out the value in
[02:40:35.840 --> 02:40:40.800]  SDR so and most of these of course are digital so this is a whole new credit
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:44.720]  line of the IMF and World Bank themselves holding companies for the
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:49.880]  Federal Reserve global system and so now they're going to bail everyone out
[02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:54.480]  with fiat made up garbage and we'll all worship them for engineering the whole
[02:40:54.480 --> 02:41:00.680]  fraud because the bottom paid for Larson is treasonous scum not even media but
[02:41:00.680 --> 02:41:07.040]  propaganda bullhorns Fox singing in BBC will not tell the drooling Prozac heads
[02:41:07.040 --> 02:41:11.600]  this yeah and by the way I have a nice little picture on my website max
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:18.320]  keiser.com of a suicide banker trying to hit Hank Paulson on the street which if
[02:41:18.320 --> 02:41:22.440]  you see the little image on my max keiser.com is that right at the top
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:25.280]  because we're going to put it on info wars as well later and we're also going
[02:41:25.280 --> 02:41:30.160]  to put it on screen right now is that your top story well it's I guess you
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:35.000]  could call it I have a link to my show Kaiser report as number one number two
[02:41:35.000 --> 02:41:40.080]  is an image that I just put up of a suicide banker trying to hang Paulson
[02:41:40.080 --> 02:41:45.840]  in an act of real patriotism but anyway getting back to the special drawing
[02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:49.640]  right we'll see them used by international corporations like
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:54.400]  Caterpillar and other big multinationals who will start to settle up
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:41:59.760]  their international deals in this new vastly becoming very liquid
[02:41:59.760 --> 02:42:03.800]  international currency the special drawing right and what this allows these
[02:42:03.800 --> 02:42:08.440]  guys to do is to take all the toxic debts on their balance sheets and to
[02:42:08.440 --> 02:42:16.360]  re-securitize them to refloat them to reintroduce them as bonds that have a
[02:42:16.360 --> 02:42:22.520]  longer maturity and as was mentioned at Davos two years ago they said right at
[02:42:22.520 --> 02:42:27.360]  Davos that they wanted to introduce a brand new 100 trillion dollar facility
[02:42:27.360 --> 02:42:32.080]  credit line they said that a year ago they said we need 100 trillion so we
[02:42:32.080 --> 02:42:37.000]  can buy everything up and run scams and leverage that out and it looks like
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:49.160]  they're going ahead with this country is like the US with let's say 14 or 15 in
[02:42:49.160 --> 02:42:52.720]  debt and they'll roll it up into a special drawing right and they'll stand
[02:42:52.720 --> 02:42:57.880]  the maturity and they'll swap that for SDRs and this has the the end effect of
[02:42:57.880 --> 02:43:02.880]  basically just debasing all these fiat currencies even more and you know it gets
[02:43:02.880 --> 02:43:07.360]  back to the same story currencies being debased precious metals are still
[02:43:07.360 --> 02:43:12.680]  continuing to go higher goals having another spectacular year up 25% on the
[02:43:12.680 --> 02:43:16.720]  year this 10th year in a row I don't know how many people don't seem to get it
[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:20.160]  this is in a major bull market it's going to be going up in for another 10
[02:43:20.160 --> 02:43:25.640]  years because these people at the top their only solution is to create more
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:29.920]  fiat money because they get paid on how much fiat money they create they don't
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:33.880]  get paid to create jobs they don't get paid to increase productivity they don't
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:38.560]  get paid to increase GDP they only get paid in terms of how much of this fiat
[02:43:38.560 --> 02:43:42.640]  money they can create so if they create a hundred billion or a hundred trillion
[02:43:42.640 --> 02:43:47.640]  that's a 1% fee that's cut up amongst just a handful of bankers that's a huge
[02:43:47.640 --> 02:43:52.480]  payday exactly now let's expand on MF global now for a week they've been saying
[02:43:52.480 --> 02:43:57.520]  it's more like three billion most people get nothing and they've sent out
[02:43:57.520 --> 02:44:00.880]  statements where even if people had a hundred percent of their own money in
[02:44:00.880 --> 02:44:04.960]  their account and they had played the gold futures market and made a bunch of
[02:44:04.960 --> 02:44:10.040]  money they're taking the money as if it never existed and sending them Gerald
[02:44:10.040 --> 02:44:14.920]  Salentes won a corrected statement saying by the way your gold is here now
[02:44:14.920 --> 02:44:18.760]  you just need to buy it at the current rate not what your contract said so
[02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:22.600]  they're just acting like nothing happened and it looks like this is the new
[02:44:22.600 --> 02:44:26.440]  system because the head of the CFTC was in you know involved in all this I guess
[02:44:26.440 --> 02:44:33.720]  he's profiting from it and so it does signal max a new level and and so do you
[02:44:33.720 --> 02:44:37.120]  agree with the Salentes they're now going to start grabbing other types of
[02:44:37.120 --> 02:44:44.080]  accounts and systems well yeah absolutely the that's the trend is that
[02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:49.600]  they're just repricing assets as they've done in the Salenci case and as a way to
[02:44:49.600 --> 02:44:56.120]  steal money and as a way to you know I'm very I wish I wish America had
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:01.320]  moulas because then an American mula could declare a fatwa on John Corzine
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:05.200]  because if the government's not going to do anything about it you know in other
[02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:09.280]  countries and other cultures they have ways to take care of these guys I only
[02:45:09.280 --> 02:45:13.600]  wish that somebody in America would you know declare a fatwa on John Corzine
[02:45:13.600 --> 02:45:17.760]  and because we need to get rid of the scourge somehow the government's not
[02:45:17.760 --> 02:45:21.520]  going to get rid of the cancer and there's no law but there is no law out
[02:45:21.520 --> 02:45:27.880]  that you know this Hank Paulson is saying that technically when he tipped his
[02:45:27.880 --> 02:45:31.040]  Goldman Sachs buddies about the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bail out a few
[02:45:31.040 --> 02:45:34.440]  couple years ago let me stop you there that came out yesterday in British
[02:45:34.440 --> 02:45:38.720]  papers and it's not even news here and and a few newspapers that did say well
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:43.560]  it's fine Congress has said they can insider trade and so compulsion you go
[02:45:43.560 --> 02:45:49.000]  to jail for that but not our dear little scam artist yeah well when when you
[02:45:49.000 --> 02:45:53.720]  have that kind of law break we have that going on and they claim he claims that
[02:45:53.720 --> 02:45:58.840]  technically he's not breaking the law but the fact is that there is no law I
[02:45:58.840 --> 02:46:04.000]  mean that the MF global points this out there's no law stopping these guys from
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:08.160]  taking money out of your account there's no law stopping Hank Paulson from
[02:46:08.160 --> 02:46:12.080]  trading on inside information and bankrupting millions of people there's
[02:46:12.080 --> 02:46:15.400]  no law anymore there's no rule of law there are no laws when it comes to Wall
[02:46:15.400 --> 02:46:18.560]  Street there's another great example is on Facebook you know they broke the law
[02:46:18.560 --> 02:46:22.680]  when they offered the insider of their customers to own stock before they're
[02:46:22.680 --> 02:46:26.360]  going to go public next in a few months and double the valuation they paid for
[02:46:26.360 --> 02:46:31.640]  just last fall and the New York Times ran a story saying well the Congress is
[02:46:31.640 --> 02:46:36.360]  going to pass a new law to cover up for the fact that Goldman Sachs broke the
[02:46:36.360 --> 02:46:41.420]  law oh yes states are passing laws and attorney generals are ruling you thought
[02:46:41.420 --> 02:46:44.440]  they'd get in trouble for the mirror system and the Robo signing they're
[02:46:44.440 --> 02:46:48.040]  just passing laws saying it's okay and I've seen cases where they're now saying
[02:46:48.040 --> 02:46:52.560]  yes Bank of America can take your house even if your house is totally paid for
[02:46:52.560 --> 02:46:58.280]  and they never owned it okay these banks are being set up like like King George
[02:46:58.280 --> 02:47:01.480]  where if he wants to have sex with your wife you have to let him you know
[02:47:01.480 --> 02:47:05.240]  British Royalty actually had that that premium octu was real and I mean it's
[02:47:05.240 --> 02:47:12.160]  literally like they are God we are scum and that just happened recently you know
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:18.600]  the Dominic Strauss Con case in France there's an old law in the books that the
[02:47:18.600 --> 02:47:23.280]  aristocrat has the right to have sex with the help and so Dominic Strauss Con
[02:47:23.280 --> 02:47:28.120]  of course is a bona fide aristocrat and he was trying to claim initially that
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:33.480]  it's in this legal right to sex have sex with any help of any of the people
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:37.400]  was cleaning his toilets that he that he wants to it's within his right there's
[02:47:37.400 --> 02:47:42.200]  even a word for it in French a verb for this and it's a well-established law but
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:45.200]  this is it these are the people they want to bring back the feudalism they
[02:47:45.200 --> 02:47:48.800]  want to bring back the good old Middle Ages where kings were kings and everyone
[02:47:48.800 --> 02:47:53.120]  else you know got the slot pigs all day long and they never liked the fact that
[02:47:53.120 --> 02:47:57.560]  after the black plague a few people that were actually able to negotiate for a
[02:47:57.560 --> 02:48:01.080]  middle-class income that's what started the middle class to begin with because
[02:48:01.080 --> 02:48:06.240]  lords are actually going to pay people to work their plan because the black
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:09.840]  plane had wiped out half the population that was the beginning of the middle
[02:48:09.840 --> 02:48:13.560]  class but the middle then the aristocrats never like that they want to go back now
[02:48:13.560 --> 02:48:17.160]  they were like you know what we want to go back to just giving you no money we
[02:48:17.160 --> 02:48:20.720]  wanted to have you a slave you know the cost of a slave in America used to be
[02:48:20.720 --> 02:48:26.800]  $40,000 back 150 years ago during the plantation days now it's $90 you for
[02:48:26.800 --> 02:48:31.600]  $90 you can put some poor slob in jail and get him working as a slave it costs
[02:48:31.600 --> 02:48:39.680]  virtually nothing slave lady is legal in America max I mean how far is it going
[02:48:39.680 --> 02:48:43.560]  to go I mean Nero started running around dresses a werewolf killing people in
[02:48:43.560 --> 02:48:47.920]  public Caligula you know after him started running around wearing his horse
[02:48:47.920 --> 02:48:51.760]  and making it the head of the Senate and wallowing in its droppings I mean are
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:55.120]  we just gonna get to that point where we're like mega bankers dance around
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:49:00.680]  with crowns like shooting kids at parks with SWAT teams running behind them you
[02:49:00.680 --> 02:49:06.240]  know fanning them with palm fronds I mean will it get to that point I think now
[02:49:06.240 --> 02:49:11.600]  the difference is you have computers and drones so computers they program to
[02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:16.120]  steal money so 70 80% of all the training on Wall Street is done by
[02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:20.240]  computers and the programs you call that because they talk about how they how
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:24.840]  they diversify the risk and culpability to where no one can say who did it and
[02:49:24.840 --> 02:49:29.240]  so it's just all these mixtures of denial and now they're gonna have the
[02:49:29.240 --> 02:49:34.920]  drones killing on their own so we don't know what the drone did it that's
[02:49:34.920 --> 02:49:38.360]  exactly right so they have drones are now okay for the US something you
[02:49:38.360 --> 02:49:43.920]  predicted two years ago that's now true and computer trading is 78% of the
[02:49:43.920 --> 02:49:47.120]  volume on the Wall Street and it's all programmed algorithmically and I know
[02:49:47.120 --> 02:49:50.320]  because I've designed programs as you introduced me to the show I've designed
[02:49:50.320 --> 02:49:54.840]  virtual trading programs how to set up a computer to go in there and you know
[02:49:54.840 --> 02:49:59.520]  basically steal money that's the unfortunate use of my technology I
[02:49:59.520 --> 02:50:04.480]  originally designed it to have a fair market but then in the hands of
[02:50:04.480 --> 02:50:10.120]  canter Fitzgerald the Wall Street terrorist firm if they've used it to
[02:50:10.120 --> 02:50:14.080]  to bankrupt people they've used to steal money you know this is an ongoing
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:18.320]  debate I have with canter Fitzgerald they they acquired my technology under
[02:50:18.320 --> 02:50:23.480]  unfalse pretenses they never paid me for the technology they never paid any of
[02:50:23.480 --> 02:50:26.600]  the shareholders you know the shareholders spent 40 million dollars
[02:50:26.600 --> 02:50:29.800]  developing that technology and canter Fitzgerald is yet to pay any of them a
[02:50:29.800 --> 02:50:33.640]  penny they claim that they lost the paperwork in a 9-11 accident that's
[02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:39.320]  like oh the dog lost my homework let's spend 10 years the dog ate conspiracy
[02:50:39.320 --> 02:50:43.280]  theory these people have never engaged in any corruption the dog ate the
[02:50:43.280 --> 02:50:47.840]  homework they owe me personally at least two million dollars
[02:50:47.840 --> 02:50:51.640]  canter Fitzgerald but they refuse to pay me because they claim oh they got hit
[02:50:51.640 --> 02:50:58.080]  in 9-11 you freaking cry baby pay up now come on Gerald Solente deserves to have

[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:48.500]  extra hour or so here today I do it a fourth hour sometimes but I've got a
[02:54:48.500 --> 02:54:53.480]  history channel out there to interview me for five episodes of a show and then
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:54:59.360]  I've got another film crew coming after that that is booking right there booking
[02:54:59.360 --> 02:55:03.200]  me two interviews back to back I like that that will be particularly grueling
[02:55:03.200 --> 02:55:08.840]  but that's why Erin Dax is doing the nightly news tonight okay let's go ahead
[02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:13.240]  and go back to Max Kaiser max we sit here and and people think we're being
[02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:20.160]  satirical this is not a joke and they're announced I mean again because of the
[02:55:20.160 --> 02:55:24.160]  mainline media is complicit and says aren't we lucky Goldman Sachs is getting
[02:55:24.160 --> 02:55:27.080]  rid of all freedom in Europe and transferring national sovereignty
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:31.720]  directly to the banking system thank goodness the economist is saying it and
[02:55:31.720 --> 02:55:35.800]  they really think they're gonna get away with this but it's not like 10 years
[02:55:35.800 --> 02:55:40.440]  ago when nobody knew that the fellow reserve was private or the ECB had
[02:55:40.440 --> 02:55:43.720]  private you know shareholders behind it they're not gonna get away with this
[02:55:43.720 --> 02:55:49.920]  long run max even if they bring in an authoritarian system like I don't know
[02:55:49.920 --> 02:55:56.040]  why people would think that I'm being satirical I mean just look at China for
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:56:01.560]  example very recently they caught one of their bankers engaged in a fraud and a
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:07.120]  Ponzi scheme and the government executed the banker now that's what I call a
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:12.680]  deterrent and they actually they've done it twice now so if this is why Chinese
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:16.160]  banks are trusted this is why people are moving their money out of American
[02:56:16.160 --> 02:56:19.720]  banks into Chinese banks because the government's willing to execute the
[02:56:19.720 --> 02:56:24.200]  guys like Hank Paulson or Tim Geiger now there's nothing satirical about that
[02:56:24.200 --> 02:56:29.320]  that's the cold hard facts if John Corzine in China he would have his head
[02:56:29.320 --> 02:56:32.880]  chopped off already and that's what I like about the Chinese banking system
[02:56:32.880 --> 02:56:39.440]  they have real deterrence well I know that when they put a bunch of melamine
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.120]  in the formula and a bunch of kids got sick they executed a bunch of people but
[02:56:43.120 --> 02:56:48.560]  here the FDA came out and said melamine is now not bad for you look at the
[02:56:48.560 --> 02:56:52.840]  banking situation they just killed they just executed two corrupt bankers okay
[02:56:52.840 --> 02:56:55.760]  you can do a search on that I don't have it handy but you can do a search on it
[02:56:55.760 --> 02:56:59.120]  and that's what they do to corrupt bankers I think about in America John
[02:56:59.120 --> 02:57:04.700]  Corzine you got JP Morgan's caught in three massive frauds in the last 18
[02:57:04.700 --> 02:57:09.040]  months they paid a little fine but caught into three massive frauds they
[02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:12.760]  got Judge Rakoff down the US who's saying that wait a minute we we have to
[02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:17.520]  revisit these cases because we just can't let the business model of fraud be the
[02:57:17.520 --> 02:57:20.560]  operating business model of Wall Street we have to actually go back and look at
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:23.680]  these cases but if they go back and look at these cases as they would in some of
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:27.080]  these other territories and countries they find massive fraud at the top and
[02:57:27.080 --> 02:57:31.360]  the deterrent has to be something that will stop people from committing these
[02:57:31.360 --> 02:57:35.960]  massive frauds of Corzine Jamie Diamond Lloyd Blank fine those are three names
[02:57:35.960 --> 02:57:39.520]  right there that in if using Chinese banking standards would have been
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:43.960]  executed by now and I applaud that whole heartedly that's not a satirical
[02:57:43.960 --> 02:57:49.040]  statement no I understand people people think reality is a joke but as as the
[02:57:49.040 --> 02:57:53.640]  immortal Jimi Hendrix said there's out there that think life is but a joke but
[02:57:53.640 --> 02:57:57.800]  thank God we're not among them but but then by the way these are the people
[02:57:57.800 --> 02:58:01.840]  piloting the whole global agenda of the New World Order it is the mega banks
[02:58:01.840 --> 02:58:07.960]  they're they're the top of the pyramid look there's a line down the street in
[02:58:07.960 --> 02:58:11.400]  Chinatown in New York City every single day people are rushing to put their money
[02:58:11.400 --> 02:58:15.760]  into the Chinese banking system because they know it's a sound banking system
[02:58:15.760 --> 02:58:20.440]  they know that they are not leveraging those banks a hundred to one so in the
[02:58:20.440 --> 02:58:24.920]  US and not content with leveraging their own banks fifty to a hundred to one
[02:58:24.920 --> 02:58:28.840]  they've engaged down these foreign currency liquidity swaps to bring that
[02:58:28.840 --> 02:58:32.680]  leveraging to the European bank so in 30 and 10 seconds what's gonna happen in
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:38.280]  Europe next Max Geyser final word it's the United Europe of gold sack hold on

[03:01:05.640 --> 03:01:10.440]  are Europeans gonna put up with the public announcements of you now have no
[03:01:10.440 --> 03:01:17.000]  sovereignty we're raising all these new taxes to pay for banker debt armed EU
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:20.800]  banker police will come into your restaurant and collected it by force I
[03:01:20.800 --> 03:01:25.480]  mean I mean I mean I mean there's now a new banker KGB in Europe you're
[03:01:25.480 --> 03:01:30.920]  descending into a new Soviet Union well in Europe you already have an
[03:01:30.920 --> 03:01:37.520]  incredibly big bureaucracy in place that will do the bidding of the top
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:43.120]  bureaucrats or quote unquote technocrats and who are living as civil
[03:01:43.120 --> 03:01:47.880]  servants as they're called in the UK and these are millions and millions of
[03:01:47.880 --> 03:01:52.840]  people who's who live as civil servants as bureaucrats for 30 or 40 years and
[03:01:52.840 --> 03:01:57.000]  they retire with almost 100% of their pay and they'll do pretty much anything
[03:01:57.000 --> 03:02:01.880]  you tell them to do so if Goldman Sachs comes into town and says we were we
[03:02:01.880 --> 03:02:07.200]  running the show it but your your job as a paper pusher for 40,000 euros a
[03:02:07.200 --> 03:02:11.920]  year is intact they won't be they won't say in fact they won't say a peep they'll
[03:02:11.920 --> 03:02:16.640]  say will you please present your rumpus we'd like to kiss it right I mean you
[03:02:16.640 --> 03:02:24.760]  know the in Europe you don't have you know in the US the residue of the
[03:02:24.760 --> 03:02:30.800]  spirit of 1776 so much I mean obviously in France with the revolution but you
[03:02:30.800 --> 03:02:35.040]  know in France you still have an economy and a country that has the old
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:39.640]  aristocracy very much in place in America you know the aristocracy was
[03:02:39.640 --> 03:02:45.760]  imported from Britain they didn't have a a natural indigenous aristocracy as you
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:49.920]  do in Europe now it's regardless they're getting ready to rob things here look at
[03:02:49.920 --> 03:02:54.040]  MF global and in closing what do you make of them set today to pass a bill
[03:02:54.040 --> 03:02:58.040]  where they admit yes we'll arrest citizens with no charge no one will you
[03:02:58.040 --> 03:03:01.840]  be arrested you disappear for life that's freedom I mean they are they are
[03:03:01.840 --> 03:03:05.040]  letting everybody know yes we are criminals
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:13.080]  yeah I mean it's a it's overreach again going back to pre Magna Carta pre all
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:16.520]  the rules and that came from the Constitution and everything that came
[03:03:16.520 --> 03:03:19.680]  out of the enlightenment it's pre-enlightenment because the aristocracy
[03:03:19.680 --> 03:03:24.280]  want to go back to the days of divine rights of technocrats dark ages I mean
[03:03:24.280 --> 03:03:28.840]  it's real simple there they're going back to the dark ages they they did great
[03:03:28.840 --> 03:03:32.840]  in the dark ages they were the kings and everyone else was their surf they love
[03:03:32.840 --> 03:03:36.720]  that that's what they want to go back to and they have computers doing all the
[03:03:36.720 --> 03:03:40.920]  heavy lifting and they just send up a drone to do all the killing so it's
[03:03:40.920 --> 03:03:45.480]  even more decadent than even the most decadent of the middle-aged kings because
[03:03:45.480 --> 03:03:49.040]  they don't even have to raise an army anymore just push a button and we'll
[03:03:49.040 --> 03:03:53.120]  just steal the money electronically and send a drone out to go kill our do our
[03:03:53.120 --> 03:03:56.800]  bidding for us electronically and the public's under mind control drinking
[03:03:56.800 --> 03:04:01.480]  liquor and flopping around on Prozac watching football on TV and so even
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:07.680]  they're getting poorer and falling apart they just have no idea I mean it's
[03:04:07.680 --> 03:04:13.560]  gonna be pretty pretty nasty I think that the public is just the people that
[03:04:13.560 --> 03:04:19.000]  are being abused by this we don't hear from them because they're living under
[03:04:19.000 --> 03:04:24.720]  a bridge somewhere or in their car they're off the grid you know there are
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:28.480]  millions of people in the US now that are basically off the grid million on
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:32.160]  food stamps it's all going down Max Kaiser thanks for joining us look forward
